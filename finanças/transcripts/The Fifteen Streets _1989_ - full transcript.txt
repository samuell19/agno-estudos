[gentle chiming music] [workers chatter] Da! What's the matter with you, man? [gentle horn music] The gaffers don't want you, da! [gentle string music] Eh, da! It's not my fault you're too old! Bastard! Hannah! The O'Briens are at it again! Blue murder! [grunts] You're not cock o' the docks any more, da! Dominic! No! Leave him alone! Come on then! Hard man. Come on, it's about bloody time! [vase smashes] [Mary] No! No! [grunts] Dominic, please stop! Shut up down there! [Dominic] Come on, then! You bastard! Are they drunk? Are they ever owt else? Eeh, poor Mary Ellen. [steam engine puffs] [wistful guitar and flute music] Hannah? Don't forget to knock up if you hear owt, right? Aye, I will! Bella Bloody Flabby Gob. [broken glass chinks] Haven't you got homes to go to? Bugger off and play round your own doors! I'll break his bloody neck the next time he messes with me. It's not my fault he's past it! Well, for some things, anyway. [machinery chugs] [whistle blows] That's it, lads! [factory whistle blows] Reet, Tom? Cheap beer that, John. Aye, and no headache in the morning, Joe. Get on with it! Tea's out. Served last now, am I? Got to work in this house or you don't eat. Not 'til every other bugger's finished! I'll wait 'til you're done. Don't be a fool, get your tea! You startin' as well, are ya? That's all it needs, you belittlin' me in front of the bairns! Next bloody thing will be the door, get out! [bucket clatters] I'm finished, ma. Can I go out and play now? Only half an hour, mind. And you can take our Katie with you. No, I've got some homework to do. Homework? Yes, Miss Llewellyn asked me to learn something. Oh aye? [Katie] I already know some of it. A man called Shakespeare wrote it. Well, howay then. O Cromwell, o Cromwell! Had I but served my God with half the zeal I served my king. He would not at my age have left me ... Naked to mine enemies. I think you must be the cleverest lass in all of school! That's what Miss Llewellyn says! She says I can be a teacher if I pass the exam. Here we go again, mam. She's the teacher's pet! Everyone says she is. I'm not! Yes y'are, you're teacher's pet! No I'm not! Miss Llewellyn's horrible! Come on, that's enough. Out, if you're goin'. Our Molly's awful, Miss Llewellyn's lovely! And she's beautiful. [chuckles] She is, our John! Aye, we know her. And she doesn't walk, she floats on air. Well, Mr Culbert's after her. Kathleen Pearson says he wants to marry her! Lucky Mr Culbert! And who's he when he's out? He's a teacher, at Saint Jude's. He'd have to be, with a name like that! [Katie] Oh John, you're awful! Where's me tea? [children shouting] Who are they? I don't know. They look grand. [carriage rumbles] [children chatter] Hello. All right Christine, keep smiling. Remember why we're here. We're fine, grandfather. Aren't we, David? Bring in the luggage. Into this house, this house here. Morning! Morning. In you go, lad. [Worker] Not too fast. They'll be lucky to get half of that in. What's people like them doing round here? They must be bloody millionaires. [Mary] Eeh, there's nowt on her for a dog to pick on! [Dominic] Need a hand, Miss? Thank you. My name's Christine Bracken. Dominic O'Brien. [Nancy] Hello, Mrs O'Brien. [Mary] Hello, Nancy. Hello, John. Hello, Nancy. [Nancy] Hello, Mr O'Brien. Aye, aye, aye, aye. [John] Well, Nancy, you look very nice today. This is a new coat. Me ma bought it, and these boots an' all, and I'm gonna get a hat with a feather in it. No! Feathers for bloody brains, if you ask me. Why don't you bugger off and leave us alone? Is Mr O'Brien in a bad mood? No, lass. It's just his dinner didn't agree with him. Hello, Nancy! [laughs] Hello, Dominic. Hey, Nancy, what's this I hear about you? They tell me you're courtin'. Eeh, who told you that? I'm not! I'm not, am I, John? Ah, nice one, you are. I thought you were gonna wait for me! Dominic, I haven't got a lad! I don't let them come near us! If they touch us, I yells, I do! Come on Nancy, away home, your mam will be wondering where you are! I'll get another lass, mind! [Mary] That's enough! [laughs] Go on, get inside, you! Well, what do you think, eh? Do you know what you've got living next door to you, Mary Ellen? Eeh, my God, as if we didn't have enough on the Fifteen Streets with the Protestants! Now this! [Mary] What are they, then? -Spooks. -What? You know. Spiritualists. The old man's one of those faith healers. [ship's horn blares] Doreen Clark was delivering a baby once in Jarrow and that man Bracken came, wanted to lay his hands on the woman to ease her labour! And did she let him? Did she hell! Kicked his arse out the door! [gentle violin music] Morning, Katie! [John] Father. How's my clever little girl, then? Out for a walk, the pair of you? Yes, Father. Aye well, you've picked just the day for it. You know, John, I believe you get taller. Oh, it's the clothes, Father. They've shrunk. Everything all right with you, John? Yes, thank you, Father. And your new neighbours? They seem all right to me. Aye, well, we'll see. Will I be seeing you at Mass tomorrow, John? Oh, I don't think so, Father. Oh dear, this will never do, not at all. I shall have to come and have a big chat with you, soon. Or shall I ask Father O'Malley to pay you a visit? I don't think so somehow, Father. [laughs] Aye, well, enjoy your walk. -Bye now. -Bye! [quiet harp music] Miss Llewellyn! Hello, Katie! [Katie] Hello, Miss Llewellyn! You're a long way from home! Yes, Miss Llewellyn. [Mary] You're John, aren't you? Yes, ma'am. Katie often tells me about your walks. I don't suppose you know it, but you're a combination of Prince Charming and God to a certain young lady. Neither of them would be flattered. And if the last one hears of it, there's not much chance of me going up there. I don't suppose that will worry you very much. I should take the heaven you're sure of. Well, I'll see you on Monday morning, Katie. I'm glad to have met you in the flesh. Now when I hear your sayings being recorded, I'll be able to place them. Goodbye. -Goodbye, Katie. -Bye, Miss Llewellyn. You don't tell her all I say, do you? No! Isn't she lovely? Aye. [Katie] And isn't it a lovely day? [John] Grand! A day of clean winds, far mastheads and bonny lasses. [Katie] That was like poetry! Aye, well, don't you go telling that one to your Miss Llewellyn. You never told me she looked like that, neither. Eeh, I did! No you didn't! [Katie] Yes I did! [John] No! [Katie] You do want me to be a teacher? Don't you? [knocking on door] [David] Away, I'll tell my grandad! [Molly] Ow! Leave the poor lad alone! But Father, he's a spook! If it was old Nick himself in there, I'll not let you pester him while he's on the lavvy! Now go on, get, before I tell your mother! [children shouting] Eeh, may God forgive us, but I hate St Patrick's Day. It's all beer and blood, whichever side you're on. Aye. There'll be skull and hair flying around today, alreet. [children shouting] [shouts in pain] Spook! Spook! Spook! [tense piano music] [Child] Your da's a spook! Ma says he's the Devil! Leave him alone! At least put a curse on him. Come on, Spooky! We'll give you a head start. Come on, give him a chance! Ready? Run! One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! 10! [children shouting] [dramatic string music] What's going on? We're chasing the spook down the river! In! John? [children shouting] Spook. [children shouting] Stay here. Your Mick's gonna push the spook in the river! [tense string music] Spook! Jump! Can you swim, spook? [David] Aw, I can't swim! I'm gonna die! Shall I let you go, you go on back there? -Shall I? -Don't? John! Do you wanna swim? No, don't! Get home and stay there. All right, son. Grab hold of the man, David. [John] Come on. [Christine] Grab hold of the man! Come on. You're all right! Come on. You're all right. [Christine] Mr O'Brien, you mustn't thrash your Mick. [John] The last thing I'm gonna do is sit down and talk to him. [Christine] Please, you'll only make it worse. [John] The tides down there are dangerous. If he'd gone in, he would have drowned. Eh, where are you at? Playing boss of the house again? You mind your own damn business. He's nearly killed the lad next door! -[leather cracks] -[Mick cries] Your tea's in the oven. I don't want it yet. Why? Where are you going? Console our neighbours in their hour of need. -[leather cracks] -[Mick cries] [thunder cracks] Ah, good afternoon. And the house was made of gingerbread. But wouldn't the birds eat the gingerbread? [knocking on door] [Katie] Hello! Hello. Is your brother at home? [Katie] Which one do you want? [Peter] Ah, I think it's ... Hold on Katie, I'll see to it. Good afternoon, Mrs O'Brien. I'd like to thank your son for helping my boy last night. It's all right. Was our Mick's fault, anyway. Is your son at home, Mrs O'Brien? Hello. Won't you come in? You must be the Mr O'Brien I owe so much to. It's us should be doing the thanking. Not many people would be taking it like this. This is my father. Hello. My name's Peter Bracken. This is my granddaughter, Christine. Hello. Aye. Well, I'll wait and see if there's a boat in. Won't you sit down? Please. Thank you. So, it's a bad day for the docks, Mr O'Brien. Aye, nowt but the post board in all week. Me ma loves it when we're all in together. You must find it very hard looking after such a big family. And I mean big. Well, you've gotta take what God sends. [chuckles] [thunder cracks] D'you like reading, then? Yes. I've got lots of books next door. [raps on door] Katie, will you go and answer that? [raps on door] Will you let Katie come to tea, Mrs O'Brien? It's rather a special occasion. [raps on door] It's Grandfather's birthday. And guess how old he is? 26? You're just 50 years out! Eeh, you're never 76! Yes, that's what I am, Mrs O'Brien! [thunder cracks] Good afternoon, Father. Won't you take a seat? It's dreadful weather we're having. Good afternoon, Father. Good afternoon. Mr Bracken's a new neighbour of ours. Father O'Malley and I already know one another. What is this man doing in your house? Well, he -- Order him to leave at once. Now hold your hand a minute! My dad's not in. Next to him, I'm head of this house. And I'm telling no one to get out. And will you take responsibility on your soul for associating with this man? I've nothing against the man. You must be the only one round these parts who doesn't. This man is an enemy of the Catholic Church. I am an enemy of no church. Why do you suppose that a man in his position would choose to live in the Fifteen Streets? Because he makes it his business to live among Catholics and turn them against the Church! I live wherever there is fear and poverty, and try to erase it. Do you know what this man has dared to say? That he has a power to equal that of Christ. In fact, he claims he is a Christ! What I maintain is that we all have the power to be Christs. If we are made in God's likeness, then it stands to reason we're part of Him. The only difference between my spirit and God's is the size of it. The quality's just the same. That's what I preach. And yes, I have done God-like things, if healing the sick, and I have healed the sick, you know I have. Silence! We haven't come here to be silent. We came here to free these people from you and your like! I leave you and your conscience to be the judge. And remember, if you want to save your immortal soul, throw him out! Snake! Ah, take no notice of him. Thinks he's still in Ireland. [gasps] [dramatic strings] [John] Mick? Go find the doctor. Go! [breathes heavily] Hold on to Christine's hands, Mrs O'Brien. Hold tight, the pain will go away. There. There. [footsteps approach] [weeps] [Mary gasps in pain] [Mary shouts in pain] Mary Ellen. Mary Ellen! [shouts in pain] Don't go, lass. Please don't go. [shouts in pain] There, now. You're all right. All right. [gasps] [grunts] [tense string music] I think she's stopping with her, Doctor. Well, I'm going to need all the help I can get! [Mary gasps in pain] [shouts in pain] Come on, pet. Come on! That's it. Come on, pet, come on. [eerie string music] [shouts in pain] That's it. [gasps] [ominous string music] [gasps] [Shane] I don't care who keeps her alive, son. Just so long as she doesn't leave us. Oh, bonny lass. [John] Ma. It's all right, John. The worst is over. [John] You'd better get some rest. It's the cramp. My legs don't seem to belong to me. There's only one thing for it, then. You're a good man, John. Aye, don't let it get about. [bright string music] Bye, ma! Katie, come here. What? I want you to go down the pawn for us. -Aw, ma! -Come on. Won't do you any harm to miss school this once. [bright orchestral music] Hello. [John] Hello. What d'you want? I've come to -- I'm afraid Mr Llewellyn's not in, and neither's Mrs Llewellyn. It's Miss Llewellyn I want to see. Oh. Well, you'd better come in. I'm new, like. I've only been here a week. I'm always showing people in the wrong rooms. This is Mary's. Miss Llewellyn's, like. Shall I take your hat and coat? No, it's all right. I forgot, what's your name? O'Brien. John O'Brien. O'Brien. [gentle chiming music] [door opens] [Mary] Hello, Mr O'Brien. Hello. I suppose you've come to talk about Katie? Aye, yes. I'm so glad. I'd like to know what plans you have for her. Would you like her to become a teacher? She's quite set her heart on it. Yes, if it's possible, that is. Oh, I think so. She's a very bright girl. And even if she's an uncertified teacher, it would be something, wouldn't it? Yes. It is what you want for Katie, isn't it? Aye, definitely. Nothing I want more in the world for her. I mean, if it was up to me, then I'd ... Sorry, I'm making a mess of this. But you see, there's so much I want to say. Take your time. There's no hurry. Thanks. Well, you can guess how we're situated. Look, I'll be straight with you. If Katie becoming a teacher depends on money, even in the future, we haven't any. Some weeks we only get by with just enough to eat, and that's it. So you see, I don't see how it's possible. And I'd rather, for her sake, that we got her used to the idea now, not to build her hopes up, like. And that's it, really. Thank you for being so honest, Mr O'Brien. No good pretending, is it? No. No. I haven't had any tea yet. Would you like some? I'm sure that together we'll find a way round it. Why don't you take your coat off? Then we can make ourselves comfortable and talk the whole thing out. [opens door] [muffled conversation] [Beatrice] Phyllis! Sorry, ma'am. Has Mr Culbert arrived early? No, ma'am. Miss Mary's having tea in her room with a Mr O'Brien. Cook knows him, he's one of the -- That'll do. The morning sky was thrust with white clouds like a fleet of sailing ships bound for the Americas. [chuckles] Now, when I find phrases like that in Katie's composition, they are yours, aren't they? Yes. Well, I can see I'm going to have to be a little more careful what I say. Not at all! You should try writing them down. Aye. I'd better be off, now. No, please don't go yet. Are you interested in boats? I mean the building of them. [John] Why, it's wonderful! Wonderful. I get that every day from Katie. Eeh, our John's wonderful! I'm afraid Katie thinks a number of people are wonderful. But not that she isn't right most of the time. [knocking on door] Phyllis? [door opens] Yes, ma'am? That will be Mr Culbert. For Miss Mary. [door opens] I love this model. My father made it himself. Your father's Llewellyn the boat builder? Yes. Didn't you know? Hello, Mary? Hello, Gilbert. This is Mr O'Brien. Mr O'Brien, Mr Culbert. Hello. Hello. Well, as I said, I'd best be off now. [Kate] Excuse me a moment. [John] Well, thank you for your help with Katie, Miss Llewellyn. I'll do all I can for her. I'm very fond of Katie. She's a bright girl. She's got a good teacher. Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. [bright string music] [dogs barking] Hello, Nancy. It's me. -No, no. -John. What's the matter? She run away! She left me! Our Annie, she left me in the market! She run away! And Mrs Fitzsimmons said I had to be back to clean out the shop when they're closed. And she had to put me on the tram. Our Annie, she had my tram fare! All right. Now stop crying. You're gonna be back in plenty of time. It's all right. [door closes] You might at least have been civil to him. He puts up with a lot from you. He's asking a lot. He won't wait forever, you know. Goodnight, Mother. [tram rumbles] Good girl. Drop her off Ferry Street, will you? Fitzsimmons Butchers? [tram bell rings] [workers chatter] All right! Come on, let's put it to a vote! Or we're gonna be arguing 'til next bloody Christmas! All those in favour! [All] Aye! [Steward] That's it! Howay, let's go home! [hums] I want my tea, now! I'm goin' out! What's up with you, then? I just want my bloody tea, that's all! Your tea's not ready yet! Can't you wait and have it with the others? You wouldn't expect God Almighty to sit down with me, would you? Well, there's some mince pies, and some bread and dripping if you're in a hurry. Oh well, that's a fine meal for a man, is it? Well, you won't wait. I'm going to fry. You're gonna fry? Well, make sure you do plenty of it. You'll need a big pot to fit his swelled head. [knocks on door] Dominic. [Dominic] Is your granda in? No. [Dominic] Hello, Christine. [Christine] Hello. Tell you what, David. Why don't you go and get the rest of the lads, and pester the life out of Bella Brown? [ship whistle blows] Come on. [door opens] John? What is it, what's happened? Mrs O'Brien. Behold a gaffer. Eeh, no. Aye. The men voted for you? All of them? No, not all. Does your da know? He took it all right. Eeh, our John. A gaffer! Come here! [tense piano music] Dominic, leave me alone! What's the matter with you? Or is it our John you're after? [door slams shut] Aye, aye, Joe Kelly. Sneakin' in an early start, are you? [grunts] What's the matter, man? Got a face on you like a bloody gravedigger. Wor bloody Nancy's been sent home from her job. What, she ill, like? Ill, my arse! She's gone on bloody strike, more like. Well, Merry Christmas, mate. Merry bloody Christmas. Well, what're you havin'? A bloody skinful. Has Dominic upset you? He asked me to go away with him. [John] Well, are you goin'? No. I'm getting a boat for Christmas, John. A real one! Does he mean a real one? Oh yes he does! Grandfather's already bought it. Aye? Well, I hope he doesn't try and get it down the chimney! [laughs] Katie! Want you to do something for me. Whenever you see our Dominic gannin' next door, you run in the other way. Why? Never mind that. Say you're borrowin' a book or something. Just never leave her alone with him. Understand? But she likes you more than Dom -- Thanks. Bed early tonight, remember! She does, you know! Ma's tired. Mary? Don't forget, we're invited to the Culberts for dinner tonight. I was informed. Lass, it's Christmas. Let's not spoil it. Don't worry, Father. I'll be there to hold your hand. Be back later. [market traders shouting] Hello, Mr O'Brien. Evening, Miss Llewellyn. Are you doing last minute shopping? Yes. Well, no. Hanging round the market 'til they give the ducks away. [laughs] Out of the road, let people pass. Some of us have got a lot to do tonight. [laughs] Well, I'd best be off. Can I carry your parcels to the tram for you? I wasn't going home just yet. Oh. But it would be a relief if you'd help me with something for a while. Sorry. [grunts] [laughs] Aye, you're bloody pissed, man! You noticed, then? [laughs] Eh, come on then, da. Away and shite! [laughs] I was wondering, like, if you had the time, would you care to go to a variety show? Or a pantomime? I'd love to. Pardon? I'd love to. Where shall we go? Oh, do you think there's time for me to make a telephone call? Aye. Where? The post office. I won't be more than five minutes, I promise. [John] Come on. Who is this friend? [Mary] Oh, you don't know him. It's a man, then. Yes, it's a man. [James] Oh, you'll be sorry tomorrow, you know. And I thought this was gonna be a peaceful Christmas. It's the loveliest Christmas I've ever known. Goodbye, Father. [James] Mary, look, who is this fellow? You don't know him! You will go to midnight Mass! [dialling tone buzzes] Mary?

Have you any idea how I felt when Florence Dudley told me that you were seen at the Empire? With a docker? No. And Will Dudley says he's from the Fifteen Streets, and that the family are notorious. Notorious? For what, mother? Poverty? Hunger? Leave this to me, Bridget. You were out with that man until three o'clock in the morning. It'll be all round Jarrow and Shields by now. I hope so. Mary!

You know which side I've always been on, don't you? But I want you to understand, I'm with your mother in this. You'd rather see me married to Gilbert, then?

Will you inform the mistress that from now on, I will take my meals in my own room? Thank you. [door closes] [children singing] And stay out! Here! All the way from Africa. One each, mind. Bloody swine should be crucified! What's up? It's Nancy. She's going to have a bairn. Hannah's had her to the doctor's, she's nearly out of her mind. Nancy? God in heaven. Who would do such a thing? She won't say. She's gone all stubborn. She's been in and out of here all day. John! Nancy, I've told you before. Get yourself away home! No. John, John. Yes Nancy, what is it? John, I'm gonna have a bairn! [laughs] Oh hell man, that's what I'd call hard up for a woman! [dramatic string music] [shouts] Fight, you dirty bastard! Outside! Mary Ellen! Let them have it out. [Mary] John'll kill him! [dramatic string music] [Christine] John! Come on, lad. He's not worth it. This time I was fighting in the right! Fight is never in the right! Oh no? Not even when your wonderful John gives Nancy Kelly a bairn? [laughter] Pint. Joe, buy you a drink? Bugger off. Buy me own. Joe, man. Got bugger all to do with me. I'm not me brother's keeper. Aye. All reet. [laughter] Well? What do you to say for yourself, O'Brien? What about? You know damn well. Joe, for God's sake, have some sense, man. What do you think I am? Why'd you take her up the country? -Me? -Aye. And give her money. You might be a big bastard, O'Brien, but I'm gonna kick the guts out of ye! Now you listen to me, Joe Kelly. There's any guts to be kicked, I can do a bit of that mesel'. But let's get this straight first. You bring me the one that saw me up the country with her, or let's get Nancy out and ask her, and then we'll see who's gonna do the kickin'. Aye. [All] Aye. Alreet, then. If you've the face, O'Brien. Come and clear yourself. Nancy, have I ever taken you up the country? No, John. Good. Have I ever given you money? Yes. When did I give you money? Up Simonside. Simonside is the country. Yes. How much did I give you? Thruppence. And what did I give you the money for? For being a good girl. -You -- -I know the night I gave it to her. I remember now, I met her in the market. Your Annie had left her in the market without her tram fare. So I took her and I put her on the tram. And Bella Bradley was on that tram. It's her's put this in your head! She said she saw you coming down the Simonside bank with her. How the hell could she if she's in the tram and it's black dark? Has he ever touched you? Joe. Come on, answer me! Did he put his hand in your clothes? Joe, for God's sake! Keep out of this! Did you lie down for him? Answer me, you slut! Did you lie down for him? Leave her be, man! You leave me alone! You hit me if you dare, see! I'm gonna have a bairn. I am! And I'll be married. I'm gonna be married when the bairn's born. Won't I, John? John? Take your hands off me. You won't get away with it like that, O'Brien! You filthy bastard! [wistful violin music] Anybody else got anything to say? You alreet? Aye. Howay. [wistful string music] [door opens] You sent for me? [Beatrice] Seems I have to these days. Been out again, I see. You wanted to see me. Mary, you know our meals are served in the dining room. If you choose not to eat with us there, I'm afraid you will have to eat out. Will that be all, mother? No. You astonish me, Mary. I don't understand how, even with your liberal tastes, you could have sunk so low. He is the father of an imbecile girl's child. What did you say? You heard me. And you expect me to believe you? Oh no. The whole of Tyneside could believe it, but not you. Be quiet! Don't you dare speak to me like that. I will! You're destroying a man's character and you don't even know him! Character? His character? What sort of character has a man got who would touch that dreadful Kelly girl? Kelly? Nancy Kelly? Yes, Nancy Kelly. You're mad! No man would touch that girl. Well, she's going to have a child, and you don't for a moment imagine it's an immaculate conception, do you? Oh, and his position of gaffer is in jeopardy too, I understand. It seems that even dockers have some moral standards. Yes, for your sake, I should hope so. Seeing as my father worked on the docks until he was 20! You seem to forget that, don't you? Your father was never a dock worker, as you very well know. He was apprenticed to a trade. Yes, what is it? I've been sent with a letter for Mr J O'Brien. [wistful string music] [John] Mary! [Mary] Oh, John! Mary, if I had enough money, would you marry me? Yes. You know I would. But could you wait? A year? Why? Just, could you? Yes, but why? I'm going to America. [Mary] John, you can't. We're going as soon as I can. It'll take a year, but then I'll send for you. I've got some money, we could go together. [John] No. I've got to go. But will you wait? John, stop this. Will you? Yes! Yes, I'll wait! Is it this Nancy Kelly business? What do you mean? Mother told me. So you know what it is that they're sayin'. Yes. I cannot prove that I'm innocent. Can't, I tried, I did. But she just -- I'm innocent, Mary. [Mary] I know. Oh, Christ, I'm sorry. I love you. I need you, Mary. I need you. America? America. [gentle flute music] [Mary] Lying, dirty slut. I swear, if he leaves us, I'll be over there with a poker and splatter what little brains you've got left all over the pavement. [wistful string music] Almighty God, great and almighty God, grant me this one prayer. And I swear to you that never until the day I die, will I miss Mass. Don't let my lad go to America. Make something happen to stop him. [Katie] Ma! Ma! Stop your noise, will you? What is it? Come here. Can I go down the slipway with Christine? David's got his new boat there. Who'll be there? Christine and David. I don't know, honey. But ma, Christine knows all about boats, and she can row. Anyway, ma, it's tied up. Christine says it's too windy to go out in it. Ma, Christine's waitin'. All right. Eh, that's enough of that. Off you go now. Bye, ma! Be careful! Dominic? [factory whistle blows] You'd better get some rest. You'll end up as barmy as that piece over the way, now. Will you have your tea now? No. I'll wait for John. Howay David, man. Come on Katie, let's have ya. I'll take Christine for a sail. [Katie] Go away, will you? We're not going out today, anyway. It's too windy! Aye, for bairns, maybe. [Katie] Christine, get in, quick. [Dominic] Katie, I'll break you when I get hold of you. [Christine] You'll have to catch us first! Christine! Hold out the oar, I'll drag you in. Bring it over here. [tense string music] Quick, Dominic! The tide! -Katie! -Katie! The tide's on the turn! [Katie] Christine? Christine! Katie, sit down! [Katie] The tide! Katie! [Katie] The tide's on the turn! We had the grain boat away all reet, didn't we, gaffer? Aye. Thanks to you, da. [tense string music] Ma, ma! Ma, it's Katie and Christine. The boat's in the river. It's drifting, the tide's going out. It was our Dominic, he tried to get in the boat with Christine. [John] Where? [Molly] The slipway! [tense string music] [Dominic] Katie! Make for the sides! [Christine] It won't move! Katie! Make for the sides! Oh, Christ! Christine! [Dominic] Make for the sides! [Katie] Dominic! Dominic, help! Sit down, Katie! Katie! Paddle with your hands! Can't! [screams] [John] Don't panic! [screams] [dramatic string music] [Both] John! Christine! When you pass the end, grab the pole! Grab the pole! [dramatic orchestral music] [Christine] John! Grab the pole! [screams] For God's sakes, Christine, grab the pole! [Katie] I can't! [screams] [John] No! Christine? Christine! Oh, Christine! Oh, my sister! Dominic! Dominic! [tense string music] [Bystander] I know him! Come on, let's go and have a look! [dramatic string music] [punch lands] [dramatic orchestral music] [grunts] [grunts] [dramatic orchestral music] [wood breaks] Stop, leave it be, lads! He's had enough! Jesus have mercy, he's killing him! God almighty, it'll be a hanging job! Get away home, Mary Ellen, you can do no good here! No! Dominic, don't be dead! I've kept me mouth shut, Dominic! I did what you told me! You've got to marry me! When the bairn's born! I've been a good girl, Dominic! [orchestral music climaxes] He's not worth it, John! The bastard's not worth it! I'll find him! I'll find him. [tense string music] Sure, we'll find him, never fear. [knocks on door] [Neighbor] Come in. [knocks on door] [tense flute music] You'd better get some sleep today, lad. Or you'll be fit for nowt when we do find him. It's no good, Molly. He won't rest. So how are we gonna get Dominic away? We need something to make him sleep. I'll go and see Mr Bracken. Maybe he can help. [tense chiming music] [Malley] You've been godless for years, O'Brien. You've already seen what happens when you go against His holy will. Now, once and for all, John, this has got to stop. Do you hear me, now? -Father -- -Quiet. The Lord will seek vengeance in His own way without any help from you, John O'Brien. Ma, I think I've given him the wrong cups. Do you want to be hanged for his death? Is that the way of it? Eh? I can't repeat it often enough. I can't repeat it often enough. If that man Bracken hadn't come into your home, this state of affairs would never have come about. The Lord looks after His own. Ah, pride, John. Pride is a, a terrible, terrible thing. [mug thumps on floor] What in the name of God's happening to me? [groans] I'll have to get home. -Father -- -Get out of me way, girl, get out of me way. [laughs] Stop it, ma. [Malley] Oh my God. Oh, Lord, Lord. [laughs] [slumps on floor] [laughs] Stop it! Stop it! Ma, stop it I tell ya! What's she laughing at, for God's sake? My bairn, my bairn, where is my bloody, bloody bairn? [sobs] [Bailey] Well, I couldn't leave him on the doorstep. [Richard] No, indeed. [Bailey] Thank you, Mr Bracken. If you have another powder, I'll make sure John gets it this time. [seagulls cry] [eerie string music] I won't be long. I'm going to the church. Mary Ellen. Yes? Light one for us, pet. Right. [eerie whistling music] [Katie] Ma? Hello, ma. Why, hinny, I thought you were gone. [Katie] No. You're not out there, then? In the sea? No, I'm not out there. I'm safe. Don't worry. Katie? I'll come and see you again, ma. I promise. And ma? Yes, hinny? Don't worry about John. [Mary] John? Oh, Katie, hinny ... Howay! Ssh, for God's sake, man! Do you want the whole town to see him off? [Docker] Dominic, wake up. Look, there's a boat sailing tonight. We're gonna put you on it. Ssh. We're all set. [thumps from upstairs] It's all right, John. Bitch! [Shane] Leave it, son! [Bailey] It's not worth it! John's coming! Where is he? Who is it you're wantin'? Don't you play with me, you sneaky bitch! He's gone, lad. [John] I'll find him! [Mary] John! [tense string music] Dominic! Dominic! [Richard] Drive on! [Mary] Hello, Molly. Is John at home? No. Could I see your mother and father? No, they're both bad. Oh. Could you give John this for me? All right. Bye. Bye. [Mick] Night, John. Good night, Mick. Goodbye, Mrs O'Brien. Come on, David. [seagulls cry] I knew you'd come. Eventually. Hello, Mary. Shall we walk? No. Do you want to talk? Talking won't change anything. It's done. I'm not going away now. Nothing will come of it, d'you understand? There's no good in going on. No. Me da's finished. There's no money coming in, only mine. We could wait. There's nothing to wait for now. Molly leaves school in the summer, your brother will soon be 14! And what about me ma and da? We could always manage to keep them! On what? And where would we live? Go on, tell us! I'm sorry. John. We love each other, we do. We know that. Please don't let this happen! There is a way out! There isn't! -Please! -No! Don't you see? It's all I've got. All I ever will have. John, there is no disgrace in being poor! And how would you know? John! [sobs] [sorrowful harp music] Bye, Mary. Napier, Rogerson. O'Neil. Champion. That's all today. John! You're in no fit state for a shift today, Joe. I'll be all right, man. Aye, and I'm the Virgin Mary. Get yourself away on home and sleep it off. Come back this afternoon, I'll see what I can do. Aye, all right, John. [children singing] [Mary] Thank you. Miss Llewellyn? What are you doing here? We're going to be neighbours, Mrs O'Brien. Does our John know about this? No. Just what do you think you're playing at, Miss? How is John, Mrs O'Brien? None too grand. He'll play merry hell when he finds out about this. Look, lass. You don't understand. Please believe me, I do understand, I do. I have to live here. I want to live here. It's just, I need your help, Mrs O'Brien. Will you help me? [shouting] [laughing] He's coming up the road. Right. Tell him to come round the front way. Tell him, tell him I'm scrubbing the scullery. Well, lass, I'll get myself away home. [footsteps approach] John. [tense string music] No. I'm not having this. You can't stop me. It's done. You don't know what you're doing. Hold me, John. [John] No. I'm here 'til you have me. [gentle string music]
