My mummy gave them to me But I only have them sometimes You see,she locks them in the cupboard But I know where she hides the key in the chimney in the fire place And when was it first given to you?

Something on the account of your commission Frank I can't go back to her what I've heard,she insisted What is she going to do with all this cash right now? Well,I don't know I didn't ask I can't understand what a dead woman is going to do with all that cash What are you talking about? That woman they found at the cliffs You know,Nick,with Frank Farmer, a deal is a deal,no matter But if there's a murder involved,frankly I don't want any part of it Murder? Now wait a minute,what do you mean? I don't mean anything I just want to ask you one question,Nick Did you let her fall out of that cliff? It's not true,Frank,I take an oath,you got it all wrong Let me tell you what happened Do me a favour,who wants to know, who do you think I am,Father Confessor Would you let me explain it to you? Don't just having a panicky, boy,I ain't the law Let me tell you Hey,you didn't mention my name Oh,no,Frank,I know better than that Now,but listen,I noted it then She didn't live far from my house We went there perhaps a couple of times together She was,you know,sort of friendly,nothing much Who's afraid and tell me? Who wants to know? I'm not interested in that sort of business Will you listen to me? So a few days ago she asked me when I am going back to New York She knew I wanted to So I said I am a bit of out of luck and short of ready So she says "Don't worry,Nick,I think I can give you a chance to make some money" That is enough to get you back to New York If you can find me a jeweler who don't ask too many questions So right away I think of you,Frank Thanks,you do me a great favour Oh,will you listen to me,it's not funny So we arranged to meet the next night in my workshop at the back of my house You know,we are on the cliffs over there And what do you think she pulls on me? I don't wait to hear She turns up pickled,she doesn't want to talk business,she wants to fool around You know So I said to her "Cut it out" I said "Where's the goods?" And suddenly she don't want to trust me So I lose my temper a little bit I told her to where to get off So right away she gets on her high horse and walks out When I come after her she starts running like a mad one Only it's pitch black out there and she's running the wrong way You know I thought she was tight So I yelled for her to stop Only she won't listen And the next thing you know She must have tripped on something and she goes over the top That's what happened,Frank So help me I never laid a finger on her Look,Nick,situation sticky I don't know whether I can end with that sort of stuff What's the matter getting windy? Who? Me? Listen,where the stuff is stolen, there's a different story But where somebody gets bumped off, that's playing with fire All right,give me the stuff Listen,Nick,I know you didn't knock the dame off I mean if you'd made up the story for my benefit I'd treat it like that But if the police they start asking questions I can't get mixed in I tell you what When you go to London,see a pal of mine,might get rid of them Thanks very much but I don't do business with strangers I'll find a way Look,Nick I'm trying to help you,I'm doing my best for you,won't I? Listen,I'll tell you what you do Leave it with me we might get little less but it'll be OK What do you mean with little less? And how long will I have to wait? What? You don't trust me? Ah,Frank,what kind of a question Listen I'm staying in town tonight to catch the hockey game you know my old team that I get to plan What if we arrange to meet after,eh?

Why do these things have to happen? -Wretched accident -If it was an accident Your own superintendent thinks it is You want to drag these children full inquest and a court trial?

No You'd better take your teddy -No -But why? He's not my real one,you stole my real one Look,I've found something You know what that is? What is it? Come into the room,there's more light Come on You recognize it? It's the label of my teddy Yes,I found it on the floor on my workshop It must have fallen off like I said You see,this really is your teddy But it is different Look,just because it seems a little different is that a very good reason to run off by yourself? Leaving John and Aunt Dora Margaret and everybody? I mean you wouldn't like to be in some strange place by yourself,would you on Christmas? Come here and sit down I want to find my mother And I am going to tell her that somebody stole my real teddy And it's not my fault Listen,I want to tell you something Look when I was a kid in New York I found a little black and gray puppy And I brought her home and I named her Tina Then my mum didn't like the idea very much because she said it was an extra mouth to feed But anyway we kept it,you see And she was always scratching And because of fleas and things you know One day when I came home from school Instead of finding my black and gray puppy I found a brown and white one And I started to cry And you know what? It was really my black and gray puppy after all you see My mum had given her a bath I can still smell the laundry soap So you see I made a mistake like this once too I wish my mummy was here Well,maybe she will be some day I'll try to find her for you Oh,Miss O'Neil,Superintendent Corrigan will see the children now Will you wait here? Come on children,you go and see this gentleman It was kind of you to bring the children along,Miss O'Neil That's all right I understand Mrs Porter is in London? Yes,she went shopping for the children I did ask your friend Nick Delaney to come along with the children He asked me to bring them because he was so busy I see Do you know where he is? I think he's at the Corn and Anchor,you know where the gym is Excuse me a moment Just about the gym at Corn and Anchor a fellow there called Nick Delaney Ask him if he would come over here Right,Sir Excuse me -There's the king of hearts -Yes -There's the king of diamond -Yes Where is the king of spades? It's king of cloves And here is the king of spades -Oh,you're Mr Delaney? -Hello,Uncle Nick -Hi Nick -Hi Here these children are friends of yours,Mr Delaney Every trick I do they say you do better Superintendent Corrigan is a member of the magic circle That Uncle Nick could put a lighted cigarette in his mouth But he's a professional I'm only an amateur Mr Delaney Katie here was telling us how she thought last night that this was not her teddy bear But I know he's mine now Cause Uncle Nick found the name tab for it Jackson,take the children outside with Miss O'Neil -Goodbye John -Goodbye-Goodbye Katie Oh,dear children Why don't you put this on your Christmas tree? You got one haven't you? -We're going to get one -Yes this afternoon Uncle Nick promised -Good,Merry Christmas -Merry Christmas Katie,you're forgetting your Teddy She'll leave it out here for a bit We'll give it back to her later Bye Lovely children aren't they,Mr Delaney? -They seem very happy at your Aunt's place? -Yeah Mr Delaney,we are anxious to close the books on this Mrs Martin investigation The verdict will probably be accidental death Inspector Blake still has one or two points he wants to carry on Mr Delaney Is this Katie's original teddy bear? What do you mean? Is this the bear she brought with her to the house? Oh yes,sure,how should I know I think it is Frankly,Mr Delaney I don't And what's more there's no question in the child's mind until after she left it with you Listen,what's the point of all this anyway? This is the point,Mr Delaney There only a few shops in Brighton that a teddy bear of that quality might have been bought Inspector Blake wants to make a few inquires And since he suggests that you could have made a replacement Me? If you go with him we'll clear the whole matter up in an hour or two Listen,what is he trying to pull on me anyway a frame up or something,what did I do? I went to the house to see if I could pick up some clothes for the kids So why do we start getting busy with me? What do I want with a teddy bear anyway? All right,Delaney,so you don't want to go with me? But I don't mind I'll go anyway but why should I be persecuted? That's quite reasonable,Mr Delaney You help us,we help you If I don't see you later,Merry Christmas Yeah Do you sell this make of teddy bear? Yes,that's ours Good morning,Sir You've been here before? I did some Christmas shopping for the kids Is there any way of finding out who bought this?
