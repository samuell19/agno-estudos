(MultiCom Jingle) (light dramatic music) - He'll be at the bar. Let him see you, then I'll rope him in. - I know my part, Tony. - It's jobs like this that give me an ulcer. (chuckling) (jazz piano music) - Hey, buddy! - Hey. - Pete, two dry ones and make the lady a Gibson. - Tony, uh, is she with you? - Well actually, she's with you. - Hello, I'm Jayne. - Sammy. - Oh yeah, I know all about you and I love what I heard so far. - I don't get it. - Well let's just say Frank likes to take care of his friends. - I'm only here for one night but Frank thought it would be nice if we could spend some time together, if you don't mind. - Hell no. - Well, I'll let you two get acquainted. Sammy, gimme a call next week. (dramatic music) - I wish all Frank's friends were as cute as you are. I'm very, very happy with this. (giggling and smooching) - What do you say, uh, we get outta here? - Okay. - Throw this on. - Oh, you're a real tiger. - How bout that, huh? - I don't know Chicago that well so you will have to show it to me, okay? - Yeah, you know, this is my town. I grew up 10 blocks from here so I'll show you anything you wanna see. - Everyone said you own the west side. - Yeah, good part of it. Let me tell you something. We're gonna have a good time tonight and nobody, I mean nobody is gonna bother us, okay? What the hell's going on here? (suspenseful music) - Put these on. - You two are dead, do you know that? - Shut up, get in. - You're makin' a big mistake, I didn't do nothin'. - Oh yeah, you try to keep the west side for yourself without letting Frank have a taste. - Yeah, you thought you were gonna get away with that, didn't you? - No, I didn't wanna get away with anything. - Shut up! - What are you doin', what are you doin'? (gun bangs) (dramatic music) (faint speaking) - See? FBI, Tony's been trying to make a move against me. He thought today was the day, well, actually it was. - God damn, you scared the shit outta me. Why the hell didn't you let me know? I could've played along. I know Frank wouldn't make a move against me. - 'Cause you're such a big shot? (gun bangs) (dramatic music) (light jazz music) It's been a long time, Frank, you look fabulous. How do I look? - Very expensive. - You always find a way to afford me when you needed to. - I never mind paying for quality, Jayne, just as long as I get what I paid for. You ever bump into Peter Quinn? - Some monkey on your payroll? - He's been carrying for me, profits, from Detroit, St. Louis, Phoenix. - Lot of cash? - Yeah but he's been coming up short his last six deliveries and you, of all people, know how I hate being ripped off. - You have such a bad temper, Frank. - I want you to show this son of a bitch just how bad. He'll be in tonight, I don't want him leaving. I mean really, Jayne, I want you to make a point here, okay? Then you bring me my cash. In this envelope, his hotel information, and something in there extra for yourself. - Thank you. - I love the personal touch you bring to your work, Jayne. You still wearing those silk panties? - Thanks for thinking of me. (dramatic music) - Hey Mom, I'm sorry I'm late. - Lunch has been ready for a half hour. - What's wrong, is it Dad? Did something happen to him? - No such luck. - Well, was it Grandma? - You want me to run down today's list? Let's see, I don't know how to handle money, I'm raising you all wrong, and how could I ever let a man like your father go? Oh, and there were two other major incidents from before I was 10 but she's saving those for our next chat. - I love Grandma but she can be a real pain in the ass. - Agreed, and watch your mouth. Lunch is served. - So, what set off the explosion this time? - Well, let's just say things are a little tight right now and I thought I could ask Grandma for help. Big mistake. (light dramatic music) - But you never ask anybody for help. Just how broke are we? - Let's just say the bank would really appreciate a mortgage payment as soon as possible. You think if I ask the manager out, he might give us a break? - That's not funny. I'm old enough to handle some of the problems around here. - Uh-uh, problems are my department. Your job is to pretend like you're getting an education and to drive me crazy, which, by the way, you do quite well. - 3,280 dollars, Jesus, Mom. - With interest accruing weekly. - Are they gonna kick us outta the house? - No, no way, this is our house, kiddo. I'm not gonna let that happen, okay? I just have to win the lottery by Friday, we'll be fine. - I'm gonna help out, I promise. - Okay, thank you. - Yeah, you know that job you told me about? Yeah, I'm interested. Okay, 20 minutes. - So, what do you need the bucks for? Did you get a girl pregnant or something? (chuckling) As if... - It doesn't matter what it's for. - I'm just saying, Steve's kinda particular about who does his deliveries. You two may not get along, you're not exactly his type. - I wanna work for him, not kiss him. - (scoffs) Shit, don't say that kinda shit to his face. Piss this guy off, he's gonna have your gonads on a butcher block. (tires screeching) (dramatic music) - [Carey] He doesn't look that tough. - Yeah, well he shot two guys that I know of. One of 'em died, just be cool, alright? (exhaling loudly) 'Sup man? - 'Sup, baby? Is this him? - Yup. - Boyd tells me you need some cash. Well, how much? - 3,000. - I ain't gonna pay you no 3,000 okay? But I will give you 200 for making a delivery for me. It won't take you 30 minutes. - What's in it? - Who gives a damn? - I do. - You are the wrong guy for this job. Boyd, do you know any more assholes who don't like cash? - Look, I don't give a shit what it is, it's just, I'm gonna need more than 200. - Well, you're gonna have to make more deliveries for me, won't you? If, if you do a good job for me this time. Here's the address. (dramatic music) - Steve said the guy'd be here at one. It's ten after and I don't see shit. - You're in this now. Go check it out. (suspenseful music) (hitting loudly and grunting) (punching and kicking) (grunting loudly) (dog barking) (knocking on door) (elegant jazz music) - Whoa. - You must be Quinn? - Yeah. Frank never sent anybody that looked like you before. Usually get the broken noses with the silk suits. - You and Frank have been working for a long time so maybe he just thinks you've earned a bonus? - And that bonus would be you? - What, are you gonna count it all here? - Nope, lost time for me. A gentleman always offers the lady a glass. - Sorry, sometimes I forget my manners. (seductive music) I gotta remember to thank Frank for this. - Thank you, ching ching. - Yeah. (smooching) Ahh, take it easy with that. Men like you always like to be treated like bad, bad little boys. - What do you mean men like me? - I mean lying assholes who try to screw over their boss and get away with it. (dramatic music) - What are you talking about? (gagging) - You've been skimming for the past six months. You're not even ambitious. 3,000 here, 7,000 there when you're carrying a million? Hey, what is that. (muffled mumbling) - You know what? - Uh-uh, uh-uh. - I've always felt that it was so important that a man knows why he's gonna die. (groaning) So, maybe you're not gonna be so stupid in your next life. (gun bangs) (dramatic music) - Jimmy, it's me. - There's not a problem, is there? - Just took me a while to say goodbye. - So, everything worked out? - Yeah, everything worked out. I'll see you in 24 hours, okay? I kiss you, I miss you, bu-bye. - Bye. - Do you know what time it is? It's way past your curfew, Carey. - Sorry. - Well, where have you been? Can you look at me when I'm talking to you? - I hung out with Boyd for a while. It wasn't very much fun. - Carey, what happened and what is going on with you? - Jesus Christ. (tires screeching) (gun firing) (windows shattering) (dramatic music) Down, stay there, they might still be out there. - It's alright, Mom, I'm okay. (tires screeching) - My God, did you get a license plate? - We don't need one. - What do you mean we don't need one? How will the police know who did it? Do you know who did this? Is that what this is about? Talk to me! Did Boyd do this? Did you get in some stupid fight with Boyd and he comes back to kill you? - It wasn't Boyd. - Explain it to me, Carey. - I did something really stupid today. I tried to do a guy this favor by delivering a package and it got all screwed up. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, delivery for what and to who? - This guy Steve, he gave me a package of cocaine and I got robbed and I never made the delivery and he probably thinks I ripped him off. - Cocaine? Is that what this is about, you're dealing drugs now? What is in your head? God. - You said we needed the money, I thought I was helping. - So this was Steve. - Yes but I can get the whole things straightened out with one phone call. - Me first. - No, Mom. If you call the police, they're going to arrest me and send me away for a hundred years. - No, Carey, they're probably going to give you probation, which is exactly what you deserve. Okay, let's just think about this for a second, okay? - Mom, Steve's a dealer, they'll get me on transporting. - How could you do this to us, Carey? - I know I'm a drain on your money and I thought I could make some of that up by doing this. I didn't think. - Look, I know that I lay a lot of problems on you, okay? And I know that you were just trying to help. You're a good kid but you know what? The stunt that you pulled tonight was stupid, really stupid. - I'm so sorry. - Okay, wipe your eyes. I still gotta make that phone call, hand me the phone. Operator, I need to place a person-to-person call, please. San Antonio, Texas. Mrs. Iris Adams. - Get a good shot of that entrance wound. I wanna see those powder burns. My, my, my, the games people play. What do you think, Victoria's Secret? - Yup, 70 bucks a pair. My wife likes 'em. Whoever your killer is, we found red and bleached blonde hair strands in the sink. - Hey, Miller? - Yeah. - Make sure we get a good description from the hotel staff for a composite, okay? - [Miller] Yeah, detective. - So what's the deal, Stan, girls like to wash their hair before or after they shoot a guy in the face? - Definitely after, this babe took her time. She really liked doing this guy. The prints are all smudged in there so I'm gonna get on the FBI and have them move their ass. I'll see if we can have them photo match. - I guess safe sex means having to wear a bullet-proof vest these days. (laughing) (light dramatic music) - Mr. Bianci, this is Darrell at the hotel. Your hot little friend just left. She got a cab to Union Station, sir. - Does everybody in this room know what happened? Quinn paid off like he was supposed to. That bitch, Jayne Ferre, I sent to whack him took the drop herself, is walking around with my money. Now, I know you worked with Jayne when she used to do freelance jobs for us. You know how she thinks and she's got a nuclear fucking device between her legs. That's how she got Quinn, that's not how she's gonna get me. You're gonna take care of this? - Yeah, we'll take care of this, Frank. - Yeah? - Take care of it. (mumbling) (light dramatic music) - Hi baby, it's me. - I know you and Grandma have been fighting a lot but it'll be nice to see the old pain. - Don't worry about me, Carey, this isn't a vacation. I called your grandmother because we need a place to stay. Our house is no longer safe. Does any of this ring a bell? - Yes, ma'am. - I kiss you, I love you, bye-bye. - Your grandmother knows what you've been up to and she isn't too happy with either one of us. (stabbing and grunting) - Check down there. (light dramatic music) - Still, San Antonio's cool and it'll be nice for us to spend some time together. - Oh yeah, it'll be one big happy family reunion. Let's just hope we don't have to suffer the wrath of your grandmother's moon pie. - Pardon me, I think you can go to the counter now. - Oh, sorry. Hello uh, Shaw, I have reservations for the next train to San Antonio, please. - [Woman] Shaw... (gasping) - Sorry, miss. - These are electronic tickets and your credit card was denied. - What? That can't be right, please, try it again. This card is up to date, there shouldn't be any problem. - She's gotta be here somewhere. - Transaction denied. We have two seats left, can you pay for them or not? There are other people who want tickets on this train. There's another one tomorrow at noon. Perhaps you can get the fare by then. - Great, thanks for all your help. - [Carey] What are we gonna do now? - We're gonna drive. - All the way to San Antonio? - It's not that far, where's your spirit of adventure? It'll be fun. I'll be Butch Cassidy and you can be Sundance Kid, let's go. - Who? - Forget it. We can make it, we can scrape together enough so we eat at Burger King once. - Maybe Grandma can help us out with some bucks. - The last thing your grandmother is gonna do is pay for our fare when she thinks we've mooched off-- - Oh, I'm sorry! - It's okay, are you alright? - As a matter of fact, no, I'm not doing too well. I'm in a real jam. My sister just had a coronary this morning and she's my only kin and she's been asking for me. So I've got to see her, I was gonna take the train to San Antonio but now that it's sold out, I mean, I didn't book my ticket in advance, I blew it. I couldn't help but overhear what you two said at the counter and I know it is forward to ask but would you like to have a traveling buddy? I'd gladly pay for the gas and the travel expenses and I'll pay for the cost of your ticket, of course. - You know, there are a lot of car rental services here at the station. - My driver's license is expired. If I get pulled over, it's just gonna be a mess. - I'm sorry, but-- - Come on, Mom, she's in a bind. - What am I gonna do? I mean, my sister is in intensive care and I might never see her again. I mean, the doctor is so pessimistic. - Lighten up, Mom, be a Good Samaritan. - What's your name? - Jeanquis Dumois. - Well, that's pretty unusual. - I'm an actress, they call me Jayne with a Y. - Okay, Jayne with a Y, why not? Another driver would be nice and we really could use the money. We're on our way to San Antonio to see my mother. - Well, that's perfect, this is so sweet. Okay partners, let's hit the road. - We're just in lot eight. I'm Emily Shaw and this is my son, Carey. - It is so nice to meet you, very nice. - Hey, let me help you with that. - [Jayne] Oh, yeah. (dramatic music) - There's three of you guys. You got three guns against one broad and she takes one of you out? Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, are you the Three Stooges or are you professionals? Now you're telling me she left the god damned train station? Find her, okay? Find her, I want this bitch's head on my kitchen table. - Do you mind? - What movies were you in? - Mostly arties, independent productions. You probably haven't seen any of them. - Don't bet on it, my son is an authority on any female who's ever stood in front of the camera. Actresses, if they're hot, rock stars, supermodels, oh, and let's not forget anybody who's ever been in Playboy. - God, Mom, I'm not a total dork, okay? - I don't think you're a dork. And you? You're a real television Mom. - What's that supposed to mean? - Hey, it's a compliment. I mean, you're taking care of the house and the kid, this station wagon work, just not my thing, you know? - Mark? These are the reports we just received from Dallas, Chicago, and New York. We've got several killings from the last couple years, all male victims, wrists handcuffed, then shot, all the victims had ladies' panties in their mouths, and all had criminal records. Meet Jayne Ferre. - My, my, my. - Yeah, beauty and the beast rolled into one nasty package. One guess who Chicago PD say she used to soldier for. - Don't tell me it's Frank Bianci. It's too early in the morning for that shit. - Is this fresh? - Help yourself. - Yeah, our dead friend in the hotel used to work with Bianci, too. She whacked him last night then she did that gorilla over at the station this morning. We found a hair sample on his clothes that matched what we found in the sink. - So, why the train? - Probably thought the security might be easier to get through? We've got some surveillance tapes from Union Station. She followed some woman and a teenage boy out to the parking lot and left with 'em. - We'll get this photo out to the highway patrol. I'll call the state police. Stan, I don't want her arrested. She may be traveling with this woman or taking her hostage. Let's just locate her and move on her quietly. The last thing we need's another bloodbath. - Yeah, that's a good point. (coughing) - I'm done, I'm done. Hi. - Where in the hell have you been? - I had a little problem. I cannot talk now but um, I have to drive. - Drive? Jayne, I don't wanna hear this shit. What about the money, who are you with? We have a deal. - I'm with my brand new friends and everything's fantastic. You know, I'll call you when we hit New Mexico. How much time you think it will be? - [Emily] Uhh, about three hours. - [Jayne] I'll call you back in three hours. - Jayne, this is bullshit, now what's goin' on? - Yeah, so how is she? Is she still in ICU? Okay, well listen to me, okay? You tell her that I'm on my way and you tell her that I love her so much, okay? You tell her that, you promise? Okay, bye. - How's your sister? - Bad, the sooner we get to Texas, the better it is. - You know, I used to live in San Antonio when I was first married, what hospital is she in? - Umm, San Antonio Hospital? - Really? Well, I don't know that one. Are you sure you don't mean St. Mary City Hospital? - Is this an interrogation, Emily? - Uh, no, no, I'm sorry, it's none of my business. How old are you, Carey? - 16. - Did you have sex yet? - Excuse me. - It will come soon. Sorry, Mommy, I didn't mean anything. So, why are you two going to Texas, what's your story? - I got in a little trouble back home. - I thought it would be nice for Carey to spend some time with his grandmother. - What happened to the marriage? Did he drink, gamble, cocaine, or just a fucking asshole like the others? - Well, a little bit of all three, I guess, and do you mind with the language, you know? (dramatic music) Steve? (suspenseful music) Honey? Steve? Fucking suck. - Men suck, they're lying, cheating scumbags. Do you love your Dad, Carey? - Well, I don't see him very much but he's basically a reformed asshole so he can teach me not to get into deep shit all the time. - Hey, enough with the garbage mouth. - I piss my Mom off a lot. - Well, you know what? I piss my Mom off, too. (giggling) (light dramatic music) (chattering) (phone ringing) - Winston. Uh-huh. - So, are you sure this cop doesn't have his head up his ass? - Yeah, it's them. We ran the plates and have an ID on the people she's with. Woman by the name of Emily Shaw. The kid's her son. We don't know if Jayne's holding them or not. I gave orders to back off. Last sighting was about 40 miles outside of Prima Point. - Okay, I'll take it from here. - We still have a deal, right? - You nail her, I still get my end. - You've been on the organization's payroll 10 years. You still have to ask me that? (phone ringing) - Yeah? - Listen up, the bitch is somewhere east of Prima Point in a piece of shit gold Toyota Corolla with a broad and a kid, get there. - Well, they already got a half day on us. - This is a no-excuse situation, get there now! - Okay, okay. Gold Toyota Corolla shouldn't be that hard to spot. What about the Mom and her kid? - No witnesses. - Why don't you make yourself useful and find out where the fuck Prima Point is, huh? (tires screeching) (light dramatic music) - Emily, you don't think we could push it just a little? Because at this rate, we won't be in Texas for a week. - We'll get there but this car doesn't push, sorry. - It's just that I wanna get out of this damn state. There's nothing but low-lifes and scumbags as far as I can see. - Geez, does that attitude help you get parts? - I'm going to tell you the truth. (light dramatic music) I'm a syndicate hit woman and I've killed over 20 people. Actually 21 with the guy I just stabbed this morning at the train station. Yesterday, I shot a crime boss and I stole from him a million dollars in cash. The mob's killers are after me and now your lives are in grave danger. (laughing) - Funny, Jayne. (laughing) - Well, it's just the best I could come up with. - It's very good. (laughing) - Okay, who's starving? - Me. - We're not gonna stop, wait until we cross the state line at least. - I can't do it, Jayne, I'm sorry. When she says she's empty, she ain't lyin'. - Okay, let's fill her up and then we get going and we make up some time, okay? - Okay, thanks for your permission and the advice. (light dramatic music) - Jesus H. Christ. I mean, my brain is gonna fry before we find this bitch. - God, I told you the food would suck, it's crap. - It's available, and when it's the only food you can find, well, that makes it pretty good if you ask me. - Well, I don't recall asking you. - Oh, really? - If you two don't stop, I'm gonna put you both in timeout. - You're right, Dad, I'm sorry about that. It's no big deal, I don't wanna sound picky, Emily, but it's just like, I'm used to the finer things in life and good food is just one of those delights. - Oh, really? Okay, well, baby you can stay here with her highness while I go to the ladies' room and then pay our check. - Hey, this is for the gas and the lunch is on me. - Pretty generous, Jayne. - Generous deserves generous. - Okay, thanks. I'll be back. - Can I confide something in you? - Sure, I guess. - You look exactly like my first boyfriend. Same deep eyes, yeah, same smile. I guess you never forget your first love, Carey. - I wouldn't know. - Of course you will. Women are just gonna eat you up. You know that, right? - IF you say so. - So, tell me about the girls at school. Come on. - I don't think I can talk to you about this. I mean, my Mom would be really pissed if she found out. - Well you know what? Your Mom's not here, come on. This is gonna be between you and me. - Um, what do you wanna know? - Well, for instance, have you ever felt a woman's breast? Do you like mine? - They're beautiful. - Well, we're all set if you two are finished. I mean, I know you're in a real hurry. - Yeah, I'm ready, Carey? - Yes, ma'am. - Carey said he was in some kind of trouble but he wouldn't say what. I mean, obviously he's a very good kid, it couldn't be that bad. - Yes, he is a very good kid but um, it's kind of family business if you don't mind. - You know, kids get into trouble when they're a teen and it's okay, it's normal. Carey shouldn't feel guilty. He should be able to be himself. - Okay, I know it's normal but it's between me and Carey, okay? - Okay, it's just like, I hated it when my Mom wouldn't get off my back. (loud rock music) (tires screeching and horn honking) Hey! - Sorry! (glass shattering) What are you doing? You coulda killed me you fucking asshole. Did you see that? Limp bastard almost killed me. I should rip his fucking head off. - Well, you scared him half to death anyway. At least you're not hurt. - Of course I'm hurt, what do you think? He's not gonna get away with this, let's go. (dramatic music) We've gotta catch this motherfucker son of a bitch. - Can we just let this go, please? (engine racing) - What are you doing? Jesus! Jayne! Get off of it. If you ever pull a stunt like that again, I will throw you out of this car and I will make you walk, do you understand me? Do you understand me? You may not have any regard for your life but I am not gonna let you kill my son and me and if you would like to continue riding through the desert instead of walking, then I suggest you get your act together. - I'm sorry, Emily, I'm very sorry. It's just all these things with my sister, I mean, we're so close and I'm so sad and upset. Please, don't leave me here alone. - Jayne, I can't-- - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everything is gonna be fine, I promise. - Alright but any more bullshit and I mean any more bullshit and I will pull this car over and let you out, agreed? I mean this and I don't swear. - [Jayne] I know you mean this, everything's gonna be fine. I swear to God. - Fine, let's just get to Texas. - I bet nobody screws with you without you ripping them a new A-hole. - I still have my hearing, Carey. (engine clunking) Oh no, oh God. That did not sound good. - [Carey] Overheated? - No, I think a lot worse than that. (dramatic music) - [Jayne] What's wrong with it? - [Emily] What do you think, kiddo, did we throw a rod or is it the thermostat? - [Carey] I don't know, Mom, you're the gearhead. - [Emily] It's not the rod 'cause we got oil. - Jesus, we're stuck in the middle of nowhere. Where the hell are we gonna find a mechanic? - Well, let's try your cell phone. - Out of service area, Jesus, this is unbelievable. - Maybe somebody back at the restaurant would know who to call. - It's 20 miles back. - I'll flag down a car. - Hey! - We shoulda caught up to 'em by now. This is the only place for miles. Let's see if these rednecks know anything. (dramatic music) (engine racing) - Hey! - We have to get out of here. - Then we better start walking. - I told you it's 20 miles back, wake up. - Well you know what? Somebody should stay here with the car. So why don't you hang out and with any luck, we'll be back for you in a few hours. - Oh no, no, no, no, you're not leaving me here alone in the middle of nowhere, no way. Then move it. The faster we get back to the restaurant, the faster we can get the car fixed, princess. (dramatic music) - Some dirtbag says he saw 'em here not an hour ago headed south. Apparently, Jayne went apeshit on some guy's jeep. Messed up his windshield with her fucking fist. I still like that fucking broad. - [Emily] That's the fifth car that's passed. These people don't even look twice. - How far do you think we've gone? - Probably about three miles. - I think I'm gonna die out here. - That's entirely probable. - Hey, here comes another car. - Hey, hey! - Hey, hey! - Slow down! - Hey, stop, hey! - Get out of my way, you guys, I know how to do this. - Oh, brother. Give me a break, it's the way the world works. See? Hello. - Is there a problem, ladies? - Yeah, thank God, our car broke down about three miles that way. - Hop on in and we'll go take a look. - Thank God, thank me. (upbeat rock music) (dramatic music) - Well Bob, it's real quaint, isn't it? - Bob's dead. Blind drunk by dinnertime but he sure knew his way around cars and I could tell you what he'd say about this one. - [Emily] Time to give it a good burial? - Eh close, 'cause bringin' her back to life is gonna take two, maybe three days. - Three days? - Your cylinder's cracked, your fuel injector's shot. Look at all this oil. I'm gonna have to do a rebuild and I just don't have the parts, ma'am. - I thought it was the thermostat, Fred. - I think it's fucking bullshit. - Listen, you must have your sources or else you and Uncle Bob wouldn't have been able to stay in business all these years, right? - Problem is, I just don't know when I'm gonna be able to get to it. I've got this Rabbit over here, it's been here two days. My truck needs some TLC. - Hey, you know what? Screw the Rabbit and screw your truck. You're gonna have those parts and have us on the road in 24 hours and if you're trying to screw us with the bill, I'm gonna be all over you like flies on shit. Do you know what I mean, boy? - Yes, ma'am. Go ahead and take a room over at the motel 'til I get you fixed up. - I like to hear that. So, the rooms are on the house, right? - Absolutely, I wanna be fair to you ladies. - Fantastic. - Phew. - [Emily] You certainly handled that situation, Jayne. - [Jayne] Let's see if they have indoor plumbing. I desperately need a bath. (light dramatic music) (phone ringing) - Hey. - Baby, it's me, listen. You're not gonna believe this. The car I was getting a lift in just broke down and now I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere. - You're not gonna tell me there's a problem with the money, are you? - No, it's fine, it's fine, of course I've got the money. What are you thinking? I just don't know when the car's gonna be fixed and time is running out and I can feel Frank's guys closing in. Won't your rescue me, hmm? (giggling) - Alright, where is it? - [Jayne] Highway 54, I think it's like 200 miles on this side of the state line. - Alright, sweety, I'm on my way. - Okay, love you, kiss you, bye. - You got to admit it, Mom, she's hot. - I know you're in hormone overdrive. I've been watching you ogling her all day. - I guess her Mom didn't teach her to mind her manners. - Well, you can't always make your kids do what's right. - You mean, like me? - No, I didn't mean you at all. - I did the wrong thing. That's why we're here in this mess in the middle of the desert. (light dramatic music) - Hey, we both screwed up. I'm still trying to get the hang of this single-parent thing. - I think you're doing great. - Great parents don't get their houses shot up because they're not keeping a close enough eye on their kids. - I'll tell Grandma it was my fault. - Halvsies? - Mom, I really am sorry. - I know you are. Shower time, kiddo. I'm gonna see if I can scare us up something to eat. (smooching loudly) - [Man] What do you think, they high tail into Mexico? - My people tell me there's no way they made it out of the country. I've done my part, now you do yours. Don't call here again. - Any word? - Nope, seems Jayne Ferre's pulled a vanishing act. - The FBI says no. I tried to keep this thing quiet but they got their own source. She's on the 10 Most Wanted List, man, and the interstate kidnapping brings the feds, sure as shit. Damn, I hate to lose a collar. A lot of people want this woman bad. - That schmucky cop claims he would have heard if they left the state. So that means they're behind us. We are gonna look under every rock around every cactus. (light sultry music) (water running) - Well you know what, your Mom's not here, come on. This is gonna be between you and me. Did you ever feel a woman's breast? - I knew you were there, young man. Do you wanna wash my back? Hey! (pounding on wall) What's up? Shit! (dramatic music) - Oh my God. (knocking on door) - Hey honey, can you take some of this stuff, please? Thank you. Why aren't you dressed yet? - Um, I fell asleep for a couple of minutes. - Oh okay, here. - Jayne, there's food here if you're hungry. Here, I think you'll be more comfortable in your own room with the door closed. - What's the matter, Emily? You afraid I'll corrupt your boy's virgin eyes? 'Cause you're a virgin, aren't you? - Oh, get out of here, go. God. - Mom, I have to tell you about something I saw. - Oh believe me, we all saw it. That's how she gets her kicks. Look, new rules, from now on, I don't give rides to strangers anymore and you don't go near any girls that I don't do an FBI background check on first. - No Mom, I have to tell you. - Carey, if I don't wash off this day, I'm gonna scream, okay? (light dramatic music) - You shouldn't have to worry about this money stuff, Mom. (speaking in foreign language) - I don't believe this. I do not believe this. Hey, wake up! (tires screeching) I don't fucking believe this. This is too fucking easy. - [Jayne] Wake up! - Jayne, what are you doing? - Where is he? - Who? - Your fucking son. - I don't, I don't know. - Where is he? Don't bullshit me. - What's wrong, what did he do? - He stole something from me. - What did he steal? - My fucking suitcase full of money. - Can you put the gun away? - Ohh, he's gonna take care of Mommy's bills. How sweet, where is he? - I don't know, Jayne, I honestly don't know. - Miss Perfect wouldn't lie to me, would she? - No. - Get dressed. - Whoa, whoa, boy, did you guys pick the wrong place to hold up. - Hey listen, uh, the owners of that car, what room are they in? - They're in 4D. (hitting loudly) (shotgun clicking) (dramatic music) - Let me tell you, bitch, if you wanna see your kid again move the fuck over there. (guns firing) (guns firing) - Who are they? - Get the fuck in the corner and shut up! - Go! (shotgun clicking) (grunting) (gun banging) - [Jayne] Let's go! (gun banging) - Shit. Ah, you stupid bitch, you see what you did to me? - You want some more, Arty? - Jayne, sweetheart, call an ambulance and we'll call it even, okay? You know me, I'm a man of my word. (shrieking) (yelling) Can't believe you shot me, Jayne. (gun bangs) - Stop or I'll kill you. He said he was going home, where do you live? I'm not playing cutesy games here. - Screw you, Jayne, and all the trouble you're in. This has nothing to do with me and Carey. - It had nothing to do with you until Carey stole my God damned money. Do you know how many lives that's worth? - Yeah, I got a pretty good idea back at the motel. - So now we can do this the easy way or the hard way. The easy way is that you give me your address and I have my money back and I won't see you and Carey ever again. The hard way is that I'm gonna pull over and cut you apart piece by piece and believe me, I know how to do this so you're gonna stay conscious for hours and you'll tell me what I wanna know. Your choice, Momma. - What are you gonna do to Carey when you find him? - Get back what he stole from me. - And then what are you gonna do? - Nothing I don't have to. - I don't believe you. (laughing) - Well, you better because I'm all you've got. I always like to wound first. One more time, where do you fucking live? - Long Beach. - There ya go, thank you, baby. - So, how much money did Carey steal? - Oh, much more than you'll ever see in your lifetime. (giggling) Oh, you think that's funny? - No, it's not that, I'm just thinking about what you said earlier when I asked you who you really were. You said you were a hit woman who stole a million dollars. That was the truth, wasn't it? - I told you, I'm not a liar. - You're gonna kill us both, aren't you? - Well, it's up to you. - We know who you are, so we have to go, right? Isn't that right, Jayne? (screaming) (tires screeching) (hitting and grunting) (hitting and horn honking) - Emily! (horn honking) Shit. Emily? You left something in the car, Emily. Looks like you don't live in Long Beach but in Studio City, you little liar. You know you're not gonna see that little beautiful son of yours again. It's too bad, he was sure a sexy hot thing. Well, maybe I can fuck his brains out before I blow his brains out. Hey, Mommy, listen to that, would you? Would you see us screwing? Couldd you see me doing that to your own little boy? Okay, seems like you wanna rot here, so that's fine with me. Anyway, I don't need you anymore. I've got what I want. (dramatic music) Well, this is what I'm saying, is this fucking kid just ripped me off and headed for Los Angeles. So, as soon as she reaches a phone, she's gonna call him and warn him not to stay home and we're never gonna get the money back. - You want me to clean this up for you? - Would you do that, babe? Oh, I'm sure you'll find her. She's probably still on the highway. - You know, you ought to be careful 'cause this could get way out of control. - Hey listen, if you take care of that, I'm gonna take care of you bigtime, okay? Just look for the bitch on the highway. See you soon, babe, bye-bye. (dramatic music) Oh, Jesus, look at that, poor thing. - Mark Winston, please. - I haven't heard from my guys in over two hours so we're gonna need to be a little more hands-on. - I don't blame you a bit, Frank. Soon as I get a lead, I'm gonna let you know. - That's very good 'cause you're on my short list, so this problem better be solved. - (mumbling) Motherfucker. (dramatic music) - Hey! Stop, hey, stop! Hey, please stop, help me, please! Please stop! Please help me. - Are you okay? I almost ran you over. - I need a ride. - Of course, come on in. - Thank you so much. (light dramatic music) - My name's Alex Tyler. - I'm Emily Shaw. Look, Emily Shaw, I know it's none of my business but how'd you end up out here? - Uh, I was carjacked. - And they stranded you? - Yeah, I really need to get to a phone to call my son. - You can use mine. - Ah, thank you. - Come on, come on, come on. Come on, Carey, pick up the phone. Pick up the phone. Pick up! Come on, come on. (phone ringing) Can you please, please, please get me back to Los Angeles? My son is in trouble, I have to get home. - Oh, miss, if your kid is in some kind of danger, you should call the local police department and send them to your house. - I can't call the cops, trust me. Please, I'm begging you, please. - Okay but there's one condition. - Anything. - You're gonna have to trust me. - What? - I'm an agent with the FBI. - Oh God, you're a cop. Christ. - If you want my help, you're gonna have to tell me just exactly what happened because I don't believe this carjacking story. So what are you, a dealer? You screw over your connection or something? - No. - Then what about your boy? - It's nothing like that. - Then why is someone after him? And why are you so afraid to call the local police? - Because if I call the cops, I'll never see him again. - Sounds like you've got yourself mixed up with some very bad people. - No, one very bad woman and if she finds him, she's gonna kill him. - Alright look, Emily, if what you're telling me is true, then we don't have a choice, call the police. - Hey hello, LAPD? My name's Alex Tyler, I'm an agent with the FBI, badge number 6871. Yeah look, we have a hostage situation potentially developing at the home of a Ms. Emily Shaw. Yeah, it involves a minor, we're heading over there. - (giggling) And the best is yet to come. Thank you, thank you, thank you, darling. And you can shoot her if you want. - Thank you. Don't worry, Emily, everything's gonna be alright. - Thanks, man. - No worries. (light dramatic music) - Better not leave this lying around, genius. (dramatic music) (light dramatic music) - [TV Reporter] The woman, whose name is Jayne Ferre, is a suspect in the slaying of Director Quinn in Los Angeles. Ferre was seen traveling with a woman, Mrs. Emily Shaw, whose car was found at a motel. Reserve caution in public, as Ferre is considered armed and extremely dangerous. Anyone with any information is urged to contact the Los Angeles Police Department. (phone ringing) - Winston. Uh-huh, put him through. - My name is Carey Shaw. I think I know where Jayne Ferre is. - Where are you? - I'm at home, I'm in LA. What about my Mom, is she alive? - Hold on, hold on. Where do you think you saw Jayne Ferre? - I was with her all day. What about my Mom, is she gonna be killed? - Hey calm down, we have no evidence of that. Now, why would you think that Jayne Ferre would wanna kill you and your Mom? - 'Cause I stole her money. The million dollars they said on TV that she robbed. I made a big mistake, I didn't know who she was and I stole it. - You're saying you have one million dollars in cash with you right now? - I have it here. - And nobody else knows you have it? - Only Jayne and my Mom. I just got home a few minutes ago. - Okay Carey, listen up. I want you to stay right where you are. I'm gonna send some detectives over and I want you to tell them everything, okay? You stay in the house and you stay off the phone. I don't care if it rings, you don't pick it up. If Jayne Ferre calls and it gets a buys signal, she'll know you're home, you understand me? - Okay. - We'll be there in 10 minutes, alright? - Yes, sir. - You sit tight. Mr. Bianci, Detective Winston. I got some great news for ya. Seems that kid who was riding around with Jayne and his mother is back in town. He says he's got the million dollars with him. Can you believe that? He says he stole it from her. - What? - He called me at the station not two minutes ago. I'm on my way to him as we speak. My bet is that Jayne's coming back after his ass to collect that money. - Okay, listen to me. I wanna talk to him, okay? I want to talk to him myself. I'm coming over to take care of the situation personally. Pick me up. (phone ringing) - Come on, Carey, pick up the phone. Pick up the phone. (phone ringing) Come on, Carey, pick up the phone. Pick up the phone. (phone ringing) Where are you? She's probably already killed him. - No, she hasn't. - How do you know that. - I can guarantee it. Listen to me, Emily, I'm gonna tell you something that's gonna take a real leap of faith on your part but I really want you to believe me. I've been working for a long time to get Jayne Ferre. I've been working undercover. She killed my partner in Chicago and not only was he my partner, he was my best friend. We also believe that she's connected to over 20 gangland slayings, we just never had the hard evidence to pin them on her. And I've been working slowly, getting close to her, trying to gain her confidence so when she did this mob guy and ripped him off, that was my opportunity. I told her I could double her money so I was on my way to Texas to meet her and when I met her up there with the cash, I was gonna put the cuffs on her. - You expect me to believe that crock? - Oh trust me, I am sticking my neck out a mile telling you this. (knocking on door) - Carey, Detective Winston, we talked on the phone. This is Detective Jones, mind if we come in? So, the detective here says you've seen that bitch, yeah? You seen her tonight? - You can answer that, Carey. - We were stuck in a small town just this side of Arizona but look, I need you guys' help. Jayne's gonna be pissed when she finds out I stole her money, I don't know what she'll do. - Oh, I know what she'll do. - Uh, detective, I'll handle this. Maybe it'd be a good idea if you showed us the money you took from her now. - Oh, my Mom-- - Let us worry about your Mom, kid. We're gonna take good care of her. She'll be just fine, okay? Now, what we wanna know from you is, first, where that bitch is, then we wanna see that money you say you have. - Can I see you guys' badges? Just so I know you're really cops. - Sure, Carey. - I didn't see his badge. - Oh, this. Look at that, you know what that is, right? You know what that is. Now you listen to me you wise ass little punk. Before I blow your brains out, you're gonna tell me where that bitch is, then you're gonna tell me where my money is. I swear to God, I'm gonna give you to the count of three. One, two-- - Jesus, wait! I'll tell you. (glass shattering) - What the hell was that? Jayne likes to mess with people first. It's definitely her style. - Oh, I'll put her hair on the walls. (gun fires) - Winston, where are you? Come with me, kid, come on. (gun fires) Oh, God. - It's funny, you all sound the same when you are dying. No more macho bullshit. - You don't have to do this. - Just a whimp, begging for me to end the pain. (gun fires) (groaning) Carey, where's the money? I want it back. (siren wailing) (tires screeching) (suspenseful music) Come on, move it. - Christ, damn it. See if you can find the kid! - It's a couple blocks down, keep going. - Move, I said. - There it is, there it is. Oh my God. (tires screeching) Carey, Carey? Carey? - Emily, wait! - Carey? Oh my God, where is my son? - We're not exactly sure where he is right now. - Who is that? - Frank Bianci, the other guy is a police officer. (phone ringing) Bianci was after the money that Jayne Ferre stole. - Yes, hello? - I'm afraid we're gonna have to ask you some questions. (crying) - Hold on. Detective, I'm Alex Tyler, I'm with the FBI. I believe I can answer your questions better than she could but I was wondering if I could have a few moments with Mrs. Shaw first? - Sure. - Would you please? - What's going on? - What's going on is you're gonna do exactly as you're told. This is for you. - Hello? - [Jayne] Hello, Emily, hold on. - Mom? - Carey? - Obviously, I've got your son so if you wanna see him again, you do exactly what I tell you. Are you with me so far? - Yes. - Good, I like to hear that. - So, Carey hid the money in the dryer. I didn't have time to get it before the police arrived so you're gonna bring it to me now. We're gonna make an even exchange and if I see any cops, I'll kill your baby boy. (smooches lightly) - Where? - Rocket Tech but I know you've met with my good friend, Alex, so he'll make sure you find it. - So, everything you said earlier was bullshit. You've been working with her all along, you asshole. Well, you're the accomplice so why don't you get the money. It's in the dryer. - Cut out the crying and do what she says, you'll get your kid back. Cheer up, Emily, the sooner they will have what they want. (radio chatter) Just relax. - No, you relax. Keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road. - What do you think you're doing, Emily? - I'm telling you what to do, scumbag, where's your gun? - Left belt. - Big gun, trying to compensate for something? - Ha ha. Look Emily, this isn't what you think. - You mean, you two were gonna kill me and my son when you got your money and then take off together? Do you mean that? - No, you're reading this wrong. - Just shut up and drive. - Look, I had to play like I was working with her so you didn't do anything stupid, like now. You know how dangerous Ferre is. She senses anything wrong, she'll kill Carey. I had to get you to cooperate until I got close enough to her to make my move. - I don't wanna hear any more of your lies. - I'm trying not to get you and your boy killed! - You have done everything to get me and my kid killed. - [Alex] So what are you gonna do, shoot it out with her? - If I have to. - You'd be lucky to get one shot off. Who the hell do you think you're dealing with? The woman's a professional. - [Emily] I will take my chances. - You have no chance. - Then you have less. If my kid dies tonight, I swear to God, so will both of you, now drive. Alright, keep your hands where I can see 'em. Get out of the car slow. Move, come on! (suspenseful music) Where are they? You better not be screwing with me. - Look, would you just take it easy, Emily? - Mom! - Carey! - Put the gun down and give me the briefcase. - I'm so sorry, Carey. - Baby, you give me the briefcase. - Okay, Jayne, you can let the boy go. We've got what we want. - Open it. I said open it, I wanna see this God-damned money. - Say, Jayne, remember Chicago? When you killed that FBI agent? He was my partner and this is the last blood money you're ever gonna see. This is payback, bitch. - Hey, my fucking money! - Carey, get down! (gun fires) (yelling) - No! (grunting and hitting) (gasping) (hitting loudly) (hitting and grunting) (guns firing) (gasping) - Whoa. (dramatic music) - Carey. - Mom! (light peaceful music) - Hey. - Hey. So, you're really gonna sell this place? - Yeah, the sooner the better. I don't care where Carey and I live, I just, I don't wanna be in a place with memories like these, you know? - You've got some reward money coming for Jayne Ferre. You'll do alright. I still feel lousy about what happened. (light piano music) - Yeah, but you got her, that's what counts, isn't it? - Well, how you doin' otherwise? - I'm healing but it's gonna take a little time, you know? - Well, maybe after a little time, you and I could have some dinner together? - Hey, kiddo. - Hey. - Hey. - I really would like the chance to show you who I really am. - Okay but right now, I am spending some time with my son. Call me. (light dramatic music) (MultiCom Jingle)
