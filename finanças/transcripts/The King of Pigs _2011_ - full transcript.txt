Kyung-min. Kyung-min Hwang. The guys who live a good life without doing much, they're like pet dogs. They're motherfuckers. And we're the pigs that they feed on. We finally become valuable when we're dead and torn apart. Kyung-min, is the pig really worth only that little? Kyung-min. Do you think so, too? The King of Pigs Yes. Hello, sir. This is KimYoung Errand Services. We found out Jong-suk Jung's contact info. Yes, go on please. Yes, would you like to write it down now? Yes. Yes, yes... But, sir, when can you pay the rest of... Jong-suk Jung 017-291-03 Hello. Hello? Is this number for Jong-suk Jung? Mr. Jung? Mr. Jong-suk Jung! What's so funny? I... I'm sorry. You can't write like this... Really... Is it your first time to ghostwrite an autobiography? The story's not even touching. You know, like... A success story about a person with passion... This is a bit... But... in my opinion, I listened to the audio many times but there weren't anything really interesting. Hey, you! Do I work for you? Are you my boss?! I can't believe my ears! You can't even write an autobiography for a person who's publishing it with his own money. And you fucking call yourself a writer? Haven't you ever read a biography as a kid? Can't you make a person into a hero in the book? If you keep this up, I can't pay you this month. If your writing can't move me to tears by next week, you won't get anything. You got that? Damn. Well, how could you write when you know nothing? Since he's a beggar for life I doubt he'd write anything good. Fuck! Why doesn't she answer? The phone you are calling is turned off. Please leave a message after the tone. Myung-me Lee. Gosh! What are you doing in dark? Did you have instant noodle again? Didn't I tell you to have a proper meal? Myung-mi Lee. Why didn't you answer the phone before? Before... I was too busy to answer it. At 2, 2:40, 4, 4:40, 6, 6:40, 8, 8:40, 10, and 10:40pm. You were busy all those times? What's wrong with you again? I was working all day. Then, I had dinner with the professor to discuss a thesis. That's why I couldn't answer. So, didn't you say he got divorced recently? So, did he ask you to move in with him? Or, did he want to fuck you since it's been a while? Or, did you two fuck already? Jong-suk Jung! Fuck! You only had dinner? Let's see. Don't look like you only had dinner, huh? Looks like you had a drink with your dinner. Fuck! Don't think you can lie through your teeth! You think you can say anything, you fucking bitch? The professor said... he knows someone working for a publishing firm. He told me to bring your novel. You said that it's your best work. Hello? Hello? Is this the number for Jong-suk Jung? Yes, but, who is this? It is you! Jong-suk. It's been such a long time. It's Kyung-min. It's been a while, hasn't it? What? Who? Kyung-min? Yeah, Kyung-min from middle school. The Crybaby Kyung-min. We were best friends. I got a call from Kyung-min after 15 years. Dear Net CEO Kyung-min Hwang. It's been a while, Jong-suk. Yes, it really has. What's wrong with your hand? Huh? Oh, I fell down yesterday. Anyway, I was surprised that you contacted me first. And you became a CEO. CEO? It's all debt, I tell you. Business is all about debt. CEO is just a title. Still, I was impressed. Did you get married? Yeah, I did. It's been 2 years. What do you do? Well, I'm just... I'm writing these days. Writing? About what? Nothing serious. Just a book. It might get published soon. Really? Then, you're a professional writer! Cool. You became a writer, a professional writer. A writer... Myung-mi Lee Aren't you gonna get it? Isn't it an important call? No, it's okay. Honestly, I didn't recognize you, at first. So different... from the old Crybaby Kyung-min. You're right. Crybaby Kyung-min. That was me. Crybaby Kyung-min. Maybe it's not so surprising that he became a CEO. Since his family was quite rich. Kyung-min Hwang! You scared me. I heard you met girls yesterday without me. Meh, they weren't that good. Kyung-min! Come over here! So damn slow. Hurry up. Hey, sweetie. Did you wash your willy this morning? Where's your willy? Don't. Wow, it's ripened hard. It was a strict hierarchical society. Our class was not that high in the society. I hated a awkward smile Kyung-min has on right now. As if he was calm. Like he didn't care. I hated the lifted corners of his mouth to show that. Hey, are you almost done? Can you do it by next class? If I work on it during the next two breaks, I think I can finish it. Hello! Hey! Hey! Be quiet! Be quiet! Sit down everyone. Sit down. Sit down quickly over there. Attention, everyone! Sit down now! Hello, first year students. I'm Jong-bin Kim, a third year student, and I'm running for president of the student council. The reason why I popped in during your break is because I need your support in this election. There is not a great educational environment for us, yet. In addressing those issues, I'd like to be the voice for your concerns! That's what I'd like to do. Well done. Good crowd. See you soon, sir. Hey, he's so distracted. You should take better care. See you soon, sir. How the fuck are you managing the boys? You guys are fucking annoying. Hey, Kyung-min Hwang. What're you doing? Sorry. I forgot to do my homework. I have no time to do it. You dickhead! Are you doing fucking homework at school? Don't you know the meaning of homework? This retard's a real bad student. Doing his homework at school. If you copy it like that, does it help you learn? Look at him. He's such a sissy. You're totally trash! Now, do your homework at home, OK? Oh, no... Hey. Kang-min! Don't you think you're taking it too far? Until then, the guy who nobody even knew existed in class, Chul came to the scene. Yeah, I wanted to meet you to talk about Chul. What the fuck? Apologize Kyung-min right now and give him back his homework. This retard's totally out of his mind. Hey, what's your name? It's Chul Kim. Chul Kim. Chul Kim. Chul Kim. Hey, Chul Kim. Did that wake you up now? Yeah, I'm awake. - Hey! ' Let go! Min! Wake up! Hey, wake up! Yes, at that moment, that's when Chul suddenly jumped into Kyung-min's and my life. Mom! Buy it for me! Mom, please buy it for me. Please, please. You already have many pants so why do you want another one? This one's different. It's Guess. The one with the triangle mark. Totally different! How much is it? It's about 100 dollars. What? Are you crazy? Who buys pants for 100 dollars? I'll get you a cheaper and better one at the market. No! This one's different! If you don't buy it then I won't eat or go to school! Let's just buy her one. I mean, she badly wants it. You're the best, Dad! The best! Then, promise me you'll study harder. I will! That's how an unsuitable stuff came into our basement home. That was the Guess Black Jean. Mix! Don't! Stop it! Sorry, boy Jong-suk! Hey... Your pants... Yeah, my mom bought these for me. I see. But, Jong-suk... the red triangle is for girls. For boys, it's green. Even after the incident with Chul, they were still the strongest ones who ruled the school. No one could dare touch them. Min was in the hospital after getting beat up by Chul. But they said he was in the hospital because he got beat up by Suk-eung, a higher-ranking student. For Suk-eung, Chul meant nothing to him, and Min getting beat up by Chul wasn't a riot, but an accident. Even Min probably was happy to be hospitalized by Suk-eung. Because it confirmed that he was still in charge of this class. They were still in charge of this place as top students from rich families. They ruled this place. And Chul was just a tiny little problem for them. Don't fags need to go to jail? Should we turn him in? Fag Jong-suck. Send him to jail! So funny! I was idiot. Why did I want to be like them? I can never be like them. They are different species from us. They are always safe, aggressive and loved dogs. I could never win them. What's with this guy? You fucking bastard! He's fucking crazy. Hey, you bastard! You fucking lose your mind? You're fucking dead! Motherfucker. Are you okay? You don't like them, right? You don't, huh? Then, be my friends. Then, you'll never have to cry again. At the time, I thought maybe he could change things. I thought I could live differently for the next 3 years. As long as I was next to Chul. For being violent to other kids, Chul got suspended from school for 2 weeks. We met Chul everyday at an abandoned house. Do you know what a knife is? A knife is... what distinguishes human from animals. It's not part of my body but it gives me power. So, you can't ever let it go. But when people made the knife, something unexpected was also made. The evil. Like that cat's sharp claws, the unwillingness to let go of the knife that's not part of your body. What makes us human is the evil itself. Then, what can we do to gain power? Would being good help? No. To gain power, we have to become evil. If you don't want to be an idiot, you gotta become a monster. Got that? Now, it's your turn. Get a feel for the knife. Now, it's your turn. Sorry. I can't do it. Kyung-min! Kyung-min. Don't worry. He'll be back soon. Chul. Did you get scolded at home for getting suspended? You think they'd care whether I go to school or not? Still, your parents must be worried about you. Parents... My so-called dad ran away after his business failed when I was in elementary school. Abandoning us. Do you know what kind of a person that I hate the most? It's a person like my dad. Since I was little he used to say that you had to have money. With money, you can be happy and have everything. But that's not so easy. Money follows only rich people. No matter how we losers try, it's not something we can get. That's why he ran away. Thank to him, my mom does dirty work for a living. She believes he'll come back some day with money. But I know very well that we'll never see his face again. I don't wanna be controlled by them like this. But, like Chul said, the only way to win them may be to become more evil than them. Is that the conclusion you make? Become evil to overcome them? Good luck! After 3 days since Chul was suspended, a new boy came to our school. His name was Chan-young Park. Most of you got this question wrong in the last exam. Only a few people solved it. Who wants to come out and solve it? No one? Let's see who solved it last time. Sir. I'd like to try solving it. Okay. Come and solve it. Yes, sir. Wow, you're good. Not really, sir. I got it wrong in my previous school. So, I took extra care to go over the question again. Good. Good. Hey, Suk-wong. There's an annoying new boy. That's him. Jong-suk, I think Chan-young's cool. Huh? I said Chan-young's cool. He doesn't look cool. But, he's always confident. He's smart and athletic. And he's nice to everyone. Huh? Yeah... Kang Min and the other guys don't dare touch him. Jong-suk! I think Chul is wrong saying that we should be evil to win them. What? Honestly, after that happened in the abandoned house, I couldn't sleep for days. I can't eat any meat products. How can you say that when some people can't even buy them? Sorry, Jong-suk. I think I'd like to be friends with Chan-young. What? Why are you telling me about who you wanna be friends with? Don't be mad. Let's all become friends. Even Chul... Crazy bastard. You can be his friend all you want. Why don't you give him meat and say you wanna be friends? Jong-suk! Someone has to represent the class in the National Writing Contest. I'm nominating Chan-young Park. Here's the form. Fill it out and give it to me by tomorrow. Do your best. I know you can do it. It's nothing. Chan-young! So, you good at writing? No, not really. I think the teacher got some wrong info. No way. He picked you 'cause you're good. By the way, I don't know what your old school was like. But we have our own rules here. Aren't you showing off too much? It's great that you study hard but don't you think it's damaging to mess up the school's atmosphere? Well, I'm not sure what atmosphere I'm messing up But if you clearly explain to me later about how I'm messing it up, I'll try not to do it. Until then, don't be randomly putting your hand on my shoulder. Damn... Min. Did you see howl held back? I did. Hey, Chan-young. My name is Kyung-min Hwang. Hi, Kyung-min. It's nothing but... my mom packed too much of the meat dish. So have some. Huh? Thanks. I had no energy eating kimchi but. A meat dish! Thanks. No need to thank me. I hardly eat it, anyway. Kyung-min! Thanks! What kind is it? Beef? What's wrong, Chan-young? What's wrong with him? Chan-young, are you alright? I think my stomach's surprised by the sudden meat dish. I need to take a shit. Damn, that shit smells... Who's the barbaric taking shit? Fuck. I feel dizzy. No clue whose shit it is but it fucking stinks. Excuse me. Who's in there? Why are you stinking up the place with your shit? It's Chan-young. Sorry. My stomach hurts. Oh! It's Chan-young, the king of writing! So, it was the king of writing who was stinking of shit. Don't be sorry. I know a great way to get rid of shit smell. Of course, shit stinks because it's shit. If it doesn't smell, it's not shit. So, don't worry about it. Shit! I didn't think it'd smell but it stinks even more! Wasn't that fun? You motherfuckers. I'll kill you, motherfuckers. You bastard! You fucking bastard! What are you doing with a knife? I thought you were a good new kid and wanted to be friends with you but it looks like you're nothing but a thug. If you threaten the guys again with such dangerous stuff I'll let the teachers know and get you expelled. So, watch out. And, don't mess up the school atmosphere. Let's go. You deserved it, jerk. Well done, everyone. Clean up the class room and see you tomorrow. Sir! Yes, Chan-young? What's wrong with your face? I fell down in gym class. You know, the Writing Contest... I don't think I can do it. I just came to this school and I need to catch up on my studies. So, I'd like to focus on studying. Well, I guess it'd be a burden for you. Let me see. Then, there's only Min. Do you feel burdened, too? Well, it's true but I'll do my best since our class honor's on the line, OK. Let's support him with a round of applause. It took only 3 days for Chan-young to learn that smile. Jong-suk! Wait up! Sure... Chul is coming back to school next Monday, right? Guess so. I miss Chul. I do miss Chul. So, how's your father? My father passed away a year ago. Oh, I see... What happened? He had a stroke and lived in pain for 4 or 5 years, then he passed... Because he had such a hard life, being sick wasn't so bad. He quit his business a long time ago and invested all of his money in me when I started my own business. He'd be pleased and proud of his successful son. When we were little, your family was one of the well-off ones. I didn't tell you but I envied you quite a lot. Jong-suk. Do you remember what kind of business my dad was in? Huh? Don't know. Was it a restaurant? What? Hey, crybaby. I heard your family's running a whore house. What? That's not true. You jerk. Your dad has a karaoke. A karaoke is a whore house. Didn't' you know? Don't you get it? So, you have no idea, huh? You really don't know what your family does? Because of people like your family run a dirty business, Our neighborhood gets a bad reputation. Let me go! Are you out of your mind? Motherfucker! What? You! Are you high or out of mind? Follow me! Are you gonna keep making trouble? You crazy psycho. You motherfucker! Are you out of your fucking mind? Chul Kim. Aren't you scared of anything? You bastard! What the... I have one thing I'm scared of. Do you know what that is? When we become adults in 10 or 20 years, I'm scared that you'll look back to this day and say how great it was and how you miss it. Listen well, Suk-eung. You'll probably not have such a future. I promise to make your memories so horrible that you'd hate to recall. Like that, Chul became the king of pigs. Wait! Suk-wong. What's wrong with you? Can't you handle it by yourself? I heard you let those thugs fuck around. You jerk. I told you to control them but you get beat up, instead. We hear a lot about him. That a psycho's fucking around and ruining the school atmosphere. Bring them to the rooftop. Today. Got that? Yes. Between Warrior and Hulk Warrior's more like you, Chul. Yeah. Hulk is stronger than Chul? No way! Chul Kim! Some gentlemen are looking for you. Come with me. How long do we have to wait? There he is. Are you Chul Kim? We're police officers. Your address seemed unclear. Where do you live now? Well, we live here and there. Really? You need to go somewhere with your mother. It's about your father. You motherfuckers. You motherfuckers! Where is that retard? I... I... Well what? Spit it out! What a stammer. The teacher took him. You motherfucker. Watch your mouth, motherfucker. Why did he go to the teachers' room? We don't know. The teacher told him to come. Fuck. You come up to the rooftop after school. Bring that fucker, Chul. Got that? If you don't find him, you guys are dead. Fucking thugs. Fucking hell. We are fucked because of you fuckers. Dickheads. Jerks. How come you're back home so early? I was about to go to work. Wanna have some instant noodles? Who are you? What do you want? Are you Mr. Sang-chul Kim's wife? You'll have to come with us. Why don't you have the boy wait for you here? You just need to identify his face. Let's go in, Chul. Yes. What rotten thugs. Why are you bullying others when you should be studying? I'll give you a lesson today. So, you can become good people. Is he your husband? The cause of death is throat rupture by poison. It seems like a suicide. I heard there was one more boy. He's Chul, their leader. He hasn't been back since he went to the teachers' room. Fucking hell. How could they have a leader? They're all the same. If we beat them up, he'll be quiet. No. He is our leader. Actually, he made us follow him around. He threatened us with a knife to follow him. We didn't do anything wrong. We really didn't. Honey! How can you come back like this? You promised to come back with money. That's what you said so, I waited patiently. How can you come back like this? Fucking money, money, money. Stop fucking talking about money! What a disloyal fucker. Do you guys rat each other out? Fucking trash. So, can you find and bring him? There's a place we go to everyday after school. He'll probably be there. The, bring him. I'll give you exactly one hour. Chul. You know what real evil is? So you wanna be the evil when you don't even know what it means? Chul. They called you to the rooftop. Jong-suk's there, too. Today, you're dead meat. Help him. Blood! You motherfuckers. I'll kill you all today. Who wants to die first? Who the fuck wants to die first? Chul was expelled from school before finishing the first semester of the first year of middle school. You know pigs... Pigs probably think their only happiness is to get fat. Who'll eat more quickly and much more than others. That's all they think about. So, they think getting fat is what makes them happy. But... All that fat isn't their own. They don't know that all the fat exists for others to feed on. I can't become a pig. I am becoming a real bad guy. On second thought, being a bad guy's not enough. I need to become a monster. A real monster. Those bastards. How would they remember these times? Would they think of it as memories? As beautiful memories? No, I won't let them think like that. Chul. We did enough. I'll commit suicide in public. What? I'll kill myself in front of them, cursing them. Then, they'll never be able to talk about this with a smile. A public suicide. I think that was the most beautiful word I have ever heard in my life. After that incident, the school was silence itself. And Kyung-min and! never exchanged a word. But we went to the empty house to meet Chul every day. Sorry. It's okay. Jong-suk! Yeah? I'm sorry that Chul got expelled. It must feel bad since you guys were good friends. But maybe it's for the best. What? Do you think I'm trash? But, could I change anything? Should I get killed while I curse at them? It's not like I could even do that. No matter what you do, there's no way to win them. I know it sucks but there's nothing we can do. So, I was thinking... Can't you just ignore them? You won't be seeing them any way when we all become adults. Don't you think? The class is about to start. See you inside. Jong-suk! Where are you going? We have to go see Chul! Jong-suk. Maybe Chan-young's right. I don't have to see them any more. Whatever they do, just ignore them. Finally, you came to your senses. That's great. Losers should live with other losers in the world. You made the right decision. Tell me! Why won't you talk? Where do you live? Which school do you go to? What's your home phone number? What's the number? It's you who's been stealing the Walkmans, right? Sis... She's totally zipped up! Isn't she in the class next to ours? I think so. I'm calling the police and send you to jail. Hello? Stop her! Where are you going? Now, how am I gonna recover that? Sis! Sis! - Sis! - Let me go! Sis! Calm down! It's me! Jong-suk. I'm fine if I don't go that way. Why did you do that? Why did you steal that shit? Are you asking me because you really don't know? Then, should I ask mom to buy it for me? Fuck, why do you need that shit? You don't have to have it. That's how it gets all pent up. It gets pent up while we give up on things others enjoy. Then, we end up being losers! What? How can you say that? Who are you saying is a loser? I can't stand it anymore. Some people meet good parents and enjoy all they want. But, why can't I do everything I want to do? If I don't even know how to use a Walkman and if I can't wear what everyone else is wearing, how will I live in the future? Not going to university. Or, can't go to university like everyone else, And meet someone like me, get married and have a baby. And what's that baby's future gonna be like? If it all comes to that, why keep having babies? Fuck! I won't do that! Or I'll kill myself after spitting on those bitches. Retard. Yeah, you just live as a loser. Unable to say a word. I'm going to learn how to use this even if I had to steal it. I'm going to fucking learn how so I'll know what's so good about it! Hey. Jong-suk, are you drunk? Huh? No way. I didn't drink much. Yeah? Well, I'm a bit drunk. Since we're almost finished here, should head out? Huh? Yeah, okay. I'll take care of the bill. Over there is the place where we used to hang out. Do you want to check it out? Let's just go home, today. It's rather late. Isn't your wife waiting for you? Don't worry about that. Stop worrying and let's go, huh? Let's go. Huh? Come. Then, let's do it on Monday. Everyone will be gathered for the weekly assembly on Monday. When all of them are there. The fucking principal will start giving a speech about doing your best and stuff. At that moment, you'll see me on the rooftop. If no one notices me, one of you shout out loud. Hey, look over there! A real monster's here to curse you! The monster's here. A monster. Yeah, Chul. You become the monster. Damn. Become a monster that rules us, damn pigs. And fight the fucking beloved dogs. What are you laughing about? Losers are losers. You'll be a disgusting monster. Just a silly disgusting monster without any power. Just a disgusting monster that bullies those weaker than you. Get away! Get away! Are you scared of even me? Scared to death, aren't you? You want to be a monster but you're scared you'll become a real monster. What do you really want to be? It's not a monster, is it? Tell me. What do you really want to be? You really want to become a purebred pet dog, huh? That's... Myung-me Lee. How did you meet your wife? We went to the same university. Nothing special. Do you have a picture of her? No photos. It's embarrassing. But I can't live without her. I know it sounds silly. But I'm afraid to die before her. I'd be scared if I was alone with death. I think I'm still a coward. Kyung-min. I always wanted to ask you about something. What? You know how we've been friends since elementary school. But, how did we become friends? I mean, your family was quite rich. Well, I don't know. I guess it just happened. And... we were not that rich. But... You're a CEO now. So, I kind of envy you. Seeing a friend so successful when I thought we were once similar. But... Don't say that. Without you, I wouldn't have had any friends. I've been able to live thus far thanks to you and Chul. When my father passed away I felt sort of free. My dad seemed to feel bad that he couldn't treat teachers like the other parents asking them to take special care of their kids. But, he did it in his own way. Happy Happy Karaoke Welcome. My Son! Did you bring here what mom gave you? Yes, here. Oh my. Look how it's all crumpled up. Hey, are there any new envelopes? An envelope? Like for a letter? Yeah, how can I give this to the teachers? What're you doing? Hurry on home. Yes. Hello. Huh? Teacher... Hello, teachers! Welcome, welcome. Please come inside. Thank you for coming to this humble place. Go on home. Did you find your way all right to get here? The bus stops right in front of our place. So, please come and have fun more often. What's wrong with you? Huh? What should we do now? What? If only we had a noiseless gun, we should just kill ourselves. I can't stand this! I'm so sick of it all. Shall we? Die together? I'm sorry. You! Are you going to keep coming in late? Huh? I gave you a couple of days off for your urgent family stuff. Are you out of your mind to finally show up now? Hey! Give them a great service. I'll even pay half for the second round, so go for the second. Who would go for it at only half price? You haven't even gone for it in a long while. Don't do it if you don't wanna. I'll send in another girl. You're so stingy, boss. Stop talking bullshit and just do your job. Boss, I'll go inside, too. Look, lady. Don't you know when you should or shouldn't go in? Let the young girls work. I don't have enough money since I was off for a few days. I'll take a quarter of the pay. So, please let me go in. Please? Stop bugging me! Why did I hire such a hag? I should just quit this damn business. Okay, Mom. Let's die together. Sis, what am I going to do? What am I going to do? It's so hard like this. I really want to have a good life. I really do but now what? Why did my life go so wrong? Don't know. Chul is strange, too. Ever since his dad died, he's spaced out all the time. He doesn't go to school and he's just spaced out. What am I gonna do? How can I live if something happens to him, too? What the fuck are you doing out here with my phone? Who said you can use the phone during walking hours? Stop hitting me, bastard! Well, what do you know? The bitch's out of her fucking mind. You fucking bitch. Leave her alone, you fucking pig! Who the fuck is he? Chul! What are you doing here? Go home now! I'm sorry. He's my nephew. Go home right now! Look at this little bastard. What's that in your hand? What are you gonna do with a knife? Huh? What are you doing there when I told you to go home. Dad. Chul! Chul! Chul! Chul! Chul! Shit. Wasn't this where the abandoned house was? I guess I shouldn't have expected it to be here still. I think we need to... Fucking hell! Answer the phone! Sorry. I must be drunk. Sorry. I was worried that if I turned it off, then the caller will give up calling again. It's okay. Everyone has their reasons. Sorry for shouting at you all of sudden. I'm a bit on the edge, these days. Since we're already here, why don't we check out the school? Hey, dickhead! You're all quiet, huh? You're so quiet ever since Chul got expelled. Stop bugging him. Why are you being a bastard? Be nice to him. Jong-suk, did you wash your willy well? Let me see. Let me see your willy. Oh, it's ripened hard. Hey, his dick got bigger. Shit. He must be a real fag. Do you like me? Stop it! What a crazy fucker. No one can hear and protect you. You know that? Mr. fag? Don't think you won Chul because you got Chul expelled. You should know that Chul is not that easily pushed away. Got that? Hey, you got balls! This shit's got real balls. Retard! Did you see how he just shrank? Was it around here? Where I was standing that day. Chul was there. Wait. Where were you? Stand straight over there. Stay still. It won't fall off. It was here. Where Chul jumped off from. I can't believe I'm back here. When I was beat up by the boys, I didn't think I'd ever come back here. But I'm here right now having grown up. Kyung-min Hwang. Why did you want to meet me so suddenly? Well, just wanted to see an old friend. What else? Since that happened, I never said a word to you. During the vacation after the first semester of the first year, we never called each other once. We never talked once during the second semester. Even when we were in second and third year, I never said a word to you. No, I didn't even look you in the eye. Then, why did you bring me here after suddenly calling me up? Huh? I told you why. I wanted to talk about Chul. So... do you feel great to have talked about Chul? No. I didn't even begin talking about Chul. What I'm about to say now is what I really wanted to say. That morning, I didn't get any sleep. I mean, I had high hopes. Maybe, excited? Something like that. But, really! don't know. I didn't know howl walked but my feet was moving. As if the ground led me to school. As the time for the weekly assembly came closer, I felt sick but excited at the same time. I wondered how everyone would react after it happens. How would everything change? My head was filled with millions of thoughts. I felt like my body was ﬂoating. It was a feeling that I can't really explain with words. I bet you felt like that, too I was nervous and I couldn't calm down. So, I thought I'd walk around the school. Fuck, fuck, fuck... Why did I decide to do that? But there was Chul. Fuck. Why the fuck did I not think of how Chul would be in school? And Chul told me there... I need to change the plan. I can't do it. I was up there before but I don't think I can. Fuck. I'll just pretend to jump. So, you just shout. Just find me and shout out loud. Look over there! Like that. Then, I guess people will come up to try and stop me. Can you do that for me? Huh? Isn't that funny? The monster. Our monster Chul actually said that. To the crybaby that I was, Chul asked me with a terrified look. Anyway, as soon as I heard Chul say that, that strange feeling, that strange feeling was suddenly gone. Then... I felt so miserable which was more than just disappointment. Was it all for this? Was that all we can do? That's what! thought. On the other hand, I was worried. Shouting out when I found Chul. Breaking the silence of the assembly. I was really not up to it. How could I shout out like that? Even if I did shout out, I didn't think anybody would notice. As fast as possible. I thought I should find Chul as fast as I could. While thinking about that, I was searching the rooftop, and! thought my heart would stop. From here... Chul's shadow appeared right from here. I have to shout out loud. I was about to shout but then, I saw the real monster. Jong-suk Jung. Did you see that, too? Where were you at the time? Did you kill Chul? You monster. Motherfucker! Motherfucker! You motherfucker! You were never on our side! You motherfucker! You fucking coward! You're a fucking coward! It was you who got Chul expelled! It was you! You motherfucker! What? What are you doing up here? Chul, our plan's still going well, right? What? Didn't Kyung-min tell you? There's a change of plan. There is no change! No change! You motherfucker! If you change it, it will become only a silly event! They will laugh at us more! Fuck! They'll just laugh at us calling us losers and saying we're such asses. They'll just laugh at us, you fucker! Crazy bastard. Life's not a joke. You're a real psycho. Getting kicked out of school isn't the end of the world. Well, if I make commotion, they might let me in again since I haven't been expelled that long. Now, I'm going to focus on how to live better with my mom. Hey, they're about to start. Get down there or hide somewhere. When I get back in, I'll just live quietly. It does no good for me to fuck around. Fuck! You motherfucker! You must be the king! Chul, you must be the king! You're not a fake. You're real. You're a real monster! A real monster. Here I go. You motherfuckers! All of you, die! You fuckers! Chul became the king! He became the king who curses you! Jerk. So what became different? I'm finished. I wanted to tell you this. I screwed up my business. It's not just screw up. I totally fucked up. I let my father stop his business and started mine with his money. But within 5 years, I'm in huge debt. Fuck. What? What was the problem? I'm finished. I'm totally finished. I have no idea how the boys are talking about those days after that but I'm positive that we can't ever talk about it with a smile. Jong-suk. Since then I... I knew what you did. But do you know why I kept silent? It's because... I knew you did it for us. Jong-suk. Didn't you? Didn’t you? You did it for us, didn't you? Huh? Right? Jong-suk. You did it for us! Jong-suk Jung. Look at me. Kyung-min! I'm gonna do what Chul couldn't do. Jong-suk! I hope you really find happiness. No! Kyung-min! Hello? Jong-suk. Why didn't you answer my call? Hello? Hello? What? What's wrong? - Did something happen? - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. What's wrong? Myung-mi. Myung-mi. What's wrong? I'm so scared. What's wrong? Where are you now? This is where the icy cold asphalt and even colder bodies tumble about together. The place called 'the world.'
