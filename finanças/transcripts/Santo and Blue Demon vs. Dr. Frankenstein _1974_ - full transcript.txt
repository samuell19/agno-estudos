(jazzy elevator music) (calm jazz music) (melancholy instrumental music) (suspicious instrumental music) (melancholy instrumental music) (suspicious instrumental music) (breathes heavily) (screams) (medical apparatus humming) (machine beeps) (medical apparatus humming) - I prepare everything according to your instructions grand master, but I still don't know who will be the donor. Gloves We're going to swap their brains. (medical apparatus humming) Let's begin. (creepy science fiction music) Scalpel. (creepy science fiction music) Give me the saw. Now begin the trepanation. Bring me the cortical cut guide from the computer. Hurry make it quick. (saw buzzing) (creepy science fiction music) - Master, here's the cortical cut guide. - Bring it closer to me. (saw buzzing) - Homicide Section Commissioner. (door slams) - Commissioner. - What is it? - A man and a young lady are here to report missing relatives. - Okay, bring them here. - Good afternoon commissioner. - Afternoon, how can I help you? - It's my sister commissioner. She leaves work at seven and always get home at 7:30. Last night she didn't come home and we haven't heard from her. - Hmm, it's the same for you? - No, sir. I only came to report that my wife is missing. Another department sent me here and please I beg you commissioner, pardon the inconvenience this late at night. - No no no, don't worry. Did you bring any photographs to identify your missing relatives? - Yes, sir. - Uh, yes, sir. (machinery humming) - We're running short of fluid. Maximize the electric charge of their transistors lodged in the cerebellum. (machinery buzzes and beeps) - Electric charge is at max. - Something is blocking the flow of the electric charge into the vital organs. Damn this body is rejecting its new brain. (machinery humming) (ominous music) - They're both dead. (machinery humming) - Another failure, but it doesn't matter. My technique is reaching perfection. I need two more assistants. What happened to those two companions that you had that were brain surgeons? - I talked to them and convinced them to work with you. It wasn't easy. They didn't recognize me at first. They didn't believe it was me until I showed them the scar one of them gave me when we were kids. - After they recognized you, no more arguments were needed to convince them right? - Of course not master. Excuse me, what do we do with the corpses? - The same as the other subjects. These two women will exit this place walking by their own means. - Why don't we put them I the crematorium? It will be easier. Why make things harder for yourself? - Because I want to terrorize society and I want the police to know what kind of master mind they're facing. (eerie science fiction music) (sinister instrumental music) - Please lord take care of my sister wherever she is and guide her safely back home. (knocks on door) (gasps) Oh my God Berta what happened to you? No no. No! (cries) No! Berta no I'm your sister! (sinister instrumental music) (eerie science fiction music) (ominous instrumental music) (zombie bangs) (ominous instrumental music) - No! (screams) (ominous instrumental music) - A special group of experts are studying the bodies of the two latest victims of that evil genius. It seems that incredibly the brains of each victim were changed with one another and both women died during the operation. Unfortunately, what experts still can't explain is how both women were able to get back to their homes on their own after their untimely deaths. The town is terrified. Police ask everyone to remain calm and promise to soon discover the identity of the man behind these heinous crimes. What could be the goal of this devilish killer? - Idiots. They couldn't find in the brains of the dead women the electromagnetic transistors that made them move and that allows me to control them from here. They wonder what my goal is. (laughs) If they knew, they would freeze in fear. (laughs) - And the heated match continues. The rivals in the blue corner are Enrique Vera is teaming up with Ray Mendoza. Blue Demon in the corner watches as his partner Santo uses a flying neck throw with all his strength to Enrique Vera. Santo does the move again. Man, the crowd loves that move. - I need the brain of Santo. - Sorry boss, but one thing is kidnapping little weak girls. Another thing is kidnapping Santo. - If my master wishes, Golem can do it. - So Golem will bring Santo here? - No! Golem has the strength of 20 men, but he lacks the dexterity and skills of that masked man. To bring him here, I would need to kill him, but I need him alive. So don't forget, anyone who hurts Santo will go to the death chamber. I have a way to make Santo come here by his own will, but our first move is kidnapping this woman. - Look at those lovely ladies cheering their favorite wrestler. And now Blue Demon starts the second fall with heavy muscle punches. Beautiful move! And now he uses a headlock and scissors for a double take down. Ray Mendoza takes cover in the corner, but no Enrique slams Blue Demon. Ray Mendoza follows the attack for the diving stomp to the ribs of Blue Demon, but Santo the idol of the crowd jumps in to help his partner. Now he's being horribly beaten by Ray Mendoza and his tag team partner. He's really taking damage. Now the crowd is screaming to the referee, pleading to him to make the two Rudos respect the rules. To stop him from beating Santo two on one. What a back breaker, Blue Demon goes in for the save, but collides with the power house Ray Mendoza, who stops him right in his tracks. Santo tries to escape from Enrique Vera, but gets caught in another back breaker and Blue Demon gets a torture rack and now both of them have tapped out. The match is now tied. Ray Mendoza and Enrique Vera win the second fall. And the match continues. This is the third and final fall. Ray Mendoza lives up to the rudo fighting style. Those techniques have transformed him into one of the most feared tag teams alongside Enrique Vera. Too bad for Santo and Blue Demon and look at that beautiful display of Olympic wrestling moves and throws. Santo tries to use all his experience to defeat Ray, but Ray keeps trying to go for the injured knee of Santo. I love it when the crowd recognizes skills in the ring. A lot of fans are on their feet. Now Blue Demon is asking for the tag. He tells Santo that they need to keep tagging even more, but Santo right now is on a mission to dominate Ray Mendoza who has just escape another attack and there's the tag. Hear that ovation for Santo. Enrique Vera also enters the ring. Blue Demon awaits him. Heavy arm bar followed by a snap throw and Blue Demon gives no rest to that arm, even when Enrique tried to escape from that somersault, the hold didn't break. Blue Demon is glued to that arm. The torture doesn't end. Blue Demon charges again. Here he comes. What's he gonna do? Oh wow, what a back breaker to the spine of Enrique Vera. Another one, Ray Mendoza wants to get in. He wants tagged in and Blue Demon goes for the scorpion death lock, this could the match but no he is interrupted by Ray Mendoza. Santo complains to the referee for that illegal move. Ooh, but the man only has one pair of arms. Ray Mendoza punches Blue Demon. And now a plank a diving plank by Enrique Mendoza and Santo goes in for the save. That counter attack from Santo was very timely, but now he receives a couple of knees from Ray, who manages to drive him into his partner, but oh Santo and Blue Demon change the move, escape and turn the tables on the Rudos and now Santo goes to the top rope and lands a suicide head butt on Enrique Vera. He takes his rival up and throws him to the ropes to receive him with an overhead throw and now ends it with an amazing inverted arm bar. No, Ray Mendoza tries to break the arm bar from Santo. The Blue Demon was there to stop him and now oh here he comes, flying head butt. Now Blue Demon uses the last of his strength to hit Ray with a scissor spin. One, two, three and the winners are Santo and Blue Demon. What a great match! The crowd in here surely agrees. Just listen to them. Everyone will go home happy after this amazing match. - Your opponents were really strong. - Yeah, that was a close call. - Those last two moves we used to win we learned from your father. - Much of what we know we learned from him. - My poor father. - Cheer up, Alicia, remember he always wanted to see you smile. - And we promised to look after you, keeping that smile intact. - You two have been really good to me. It was thanks to you I could finish my schooling. - Your father will be very proud to see you turning into a bacteriologist. - In fact, he always was proud of having a daughter like you. - Well no need to keep on like this. Remember you invited me to dinner. - Of course we remember. - But we also invited Lilia. - Blue, I'm starting to feel a little jealous sweetheart. - But why, Lilia was your best friend. You invited her to live with you when your father died and were left alone. - Are you jealous of Lilia? Do you want the spotlight? - A little. Hurry up, we still have to pick up Lilia. - We won't take long. - You know I have never seen one of Blue's matches before. I think I would faint if I did. - Don't worry. I've seen Santo fight plenty of times. - And how do you feel when he gets punched? - When he gets punched, I get this horrible desire to get in the ring and kill his opponent. - Well, you could give us a hand in the ring. - Are you serious? - Well you know I'd prefer your hand right here. - Well I promise although I may faint there, I'll go to your next match Blue. - I'd rather you didn't. I would worry about you getting distracted and lose the match. - Well are you going or not? - If he wants me to I will. (laughs) - This afternoon, the latest two victims of the sadistic genius received a proper Christian burial. The identity of that criminal is still shrouded in complete mystery. - Would you girls like to go anywhere else? - No thank you, tomorrow I have to get up early and go to the laboratory. - And I have to go the office. - Is your boss very strict? - Professor Ruiz is lovable, but I can't abuse that. - Lovable huh? - Yes, it's a shame he's 76 years old. - And your boss is also lovable. Is he 76 years old too? - Oh, he's only 30, but I hate him. (laughs) - I don't like that you live alone. That dangerous criminal is still on the loose. - Well he's only killed 12 women. - 12 victims seems little to you? - More than enough. What I meant to say is it's still remaining in this city, there are more than two million women. That's counting Lilia and me guys, good night. - See you tomorrow. Let's go. (zombie groans) - This colossus is Bortis. I will transplant Santo's brain into him. Now you understand? - Yes master. You will create a monster as strong as Golem and as fast and as skilled as Santo. - And one I'll be able to control as I do Golem. - It will be wonderful. - To achieve this wondrousness I need Santo and to have Santo I have to have Alicia. (beakers bubbling) - Good morning Alicia. - Good morning professor. - I can't believe what's happening in this crazy city. - Strange murders continue. Yes, that's horrible. - Did you go out last night Alicia? - Yes professor, I went to see Santo fight and then had dinner. Have you ever seen a wrestling match? - Never, I hate violence. Well maybe I have gone to a lucha match, but I forget. Is it not where a bull charges and strikes a poor horse? - No professor. One of these nights, I'll take you to see Santo fight. He's wonderful. - I would love to, but I don't think my wife would approve of it. She has me on a leash that I can't break. But let's return to last night. Were you very late arriving home? - Around midnight. - Accompanied by your boyfriend. - Accompanied by Santo. - Ah, so Santo is your boyfriend. - No, he was one of my father's students. - But he is in love with you. - I don't know. - Why don't you ask him? - You think I should do that? - What I think is that Santo will be willing to do a great sacrifice for you. - What kind of sacrifice? - A great sacrifice, for example, marry you. Well marrying you wouldn't be a great sacrifice. It is quite the opposite. - What do you think? - You'll see when you get married, you stop being single, but coming back to Santo. He Santo oh my God I lost my train of thought. Well what I want to tell you that I want to finish these samples and don't leave before finishing them and when you finish, wait for me to count and check them. - Of course professor. - And remember to wash your hands. - See you later. (beakers bubbling) - Please do come in. These are the doctors who I talked to you about. They both are childhood friends of mine and also classmates. - I'm in. Dr. Molina is a year older than me. I am amazed by his rejuvenation. - I am not as young as I look either. I'm 113 years old. My name is Irving Frankenstein. - Aren't you that famous scientist, creator of the equally famous monster? - No, he was my grandfather. I inherited his knowledge and formulas. That's why I'm able to beat old age. I suppose Dr. Molina has talked to you about my brain transplant experiments. - Yes doctor, we know of them. - But he hasn't told you the reason or the goal of those experiments. - Of course not, master, I wouldn't do that. - Would you kindly follow me gentleman? This way. (machinery humming) That is Sandra, my lovely wife, gentleman. 80 years ago she was the victim of brain cancer. Since then I've kept her frozen until I can transplant a healthy brain to bring her back to life. To ensure my success, I perfect my skills by doing experimental transplants. Till now the 12 women I have experimented on unfortunately have all died. My only success has been Golem. In Golem, I transplanted a brain from a colossus brought to me from South Africa. Golem was already a human colossus himself. - You're now looking at the only human being that lives with a brain from another. Prodigious! Extraordinary! - At the base of Golem's brain, I put a small transistor, which sends the vital electric fluid to the different parts of the brain. By using this mini electromagnetic transmitter, I distribute the fluid of the transistor lodged in the brain of Golem, which allows me to control his actions. Furthermore, by increasing or decreasing the charge, I can make him as strong as 20 men or as weak as a child. Gentleman with a team of super humans like Golem, but gifted with the brains of super athletes, I could take over the leaders of humanity and conquer the world. But I would gain nothing from conquering the world and bringing Sandra back if I didn't keep my youth. Let's go to my lab gentleman. Some time ago, I discovered and was able to isolate beta factors from human blood. It makes wounds heal and also renews organic tissue. Once that factor starts decreasing, we start getting older. Old age gentleman is nothing more than a lack of beta factor in the blood. By replenishing the missing beta factor, I can return youth to any old person. This here is beta factor. And this is a compound that I discovered, which negates or neutralizes beta factor. If I drank it, I would age 50 years in 50 seconds. Since these gentleman want to help me, prepare them to receive the beta factor. - Commissioner, Suarez and Rosalez are here. - Tell them to come in. - Well any news? - Absolutely nothing commander. - I do have something. - What? - A report, a report about two neurosurgeons who disappeared. In this investigation, we noted that both of them got in a black car outside of the neurological center and haven't been seen since. - Oh God, don't tell me that madman will start killing surgeons. - This report is interesting because neurosurgeons are the doctors behind brain surgeries. You understand me ladies? - Oh, which is precisely what the killer does. - Carmalita you're a genius. - Are you serious sir? - Yes I am. - Drink this liquid while holding your breath. Next, take a deep breath. - Doctor how much time until it takes effect? - The transformation will begin immediately. (grunts) (dramatic music) - Genaro, give me mirror please, a mirror please. (laughs) It's amazing! Absolutely amazing! I'm very young. I'm young once again. As young as you Genaro. - Told you. - For Pete's sake, Alicia, it's almost midnight. Why are you still here? - Professor, you told me to stay here until I finished with the samples. - Oh, and have you finished? - Yes I did. - Then let's go sweetheart. I will take you home now. - Don't bother, I'll call a taxi. See you tomorrow professor. - See you tomorrow my child. (dog barks) - Hey taxi. (dog barks) (ominous music) Stop, please! (car wheels screeching) No, let me go, let me go, ah! (ominous music) Help me please! - Follow that car quickly. (siren wailing) - Boss the cops have us cornered. Tell Golem to attack them. (sirens wailing) (ominous music) - Attention Golem, attack the police officers. Remember their bullets can't harm you. You have body armor underneath your clothes. - Stop, who are you? Answer me. - Stay where you are. Stop now or we will open fire. (gun shots ringing out) (grunts) (ominous music) (laughs) (grunts) - Four policemen torn to pieces by strange man. One of them survived a few hours to tell the story. - Commissioner Professor Ruiz wants to meet you. - Send him in. - Thank you. Good morning commissioner. - Good morning sir, please take a seat. - Thank you. - How can I help you? - I came to report a disappearance of my assistant, young Ms. Alicia Robles. You know I own a chemical laboratory, right? And Alicia works with me... - Professor Ruiz, these two young detectives have been specially assigned to the investigation of all the women who have disappeared lately and who were, unfortunately, later found dead. The professor came to report the disappearance of a woman who worked with him. - When did you notice your colleague went missing? - It was last night. - How do you know it was last night? - I suppose it was last night because she didn't come to the lab today and last night she didn't come home. - You went to her address to search for her? - Yes and I talked to a young lady that lives with her. - Ah and she told her Alicia didn't come home. - I don't remember what she told me, but what I do remember is that the little lady was really scared. - What family or relations does Ms. Robles have? - I don't know any relatives and as for other kinds of relationships, that's Santo, Blue Demon, Blue Demon and Santo or maybe me? - Explain yourself. - What do I need to explain? - Everything that has to do with Santo, Blue Demon and Alicia Robles. - I do believe that she's married to them. - Both of them? - No no no no, deary, now I remember. Alicia told me that she still hadn't married anyone, but I think that Santo wants to marry her. - Professor Ruiz, did you take your meds today? - Uh huh, uh huh, yes tell the commander we're on our way. What could the commander want? - I don't have any idea, but let's go meet him. - Let's go. - Good morning sir. - Good morning. - Were you looking for us? - Yes, gentleman, thank you very much for coming. I'm Commissioner Gutierrez. These young ladies are the two detectives assigned to the case of the 12 murdered young women and well these gentlemen don't really need any introduction. - Of course not. - How can we help you? - I asked you come to inform you of a certain case you might be interested in. It's a very serious problem and perhaps even a painful one. - What is it? - It's about Ms. Alicia Robles. Do you know her? - What happened to Alicia? - She disappeared. - When? - Last night. - Professor Ruiz came to report the case. He told us that Ms. Robles didn't come to work this morning at the laboratory where she works. The professor asked for more information at her home, but she didn't get there last night. Professor Ruiz himself informed us of the relationship of Ms. Robles with both of you, though he was vague and contradicted himself. - Alicia is an immensely loved person for the both of us. - Do you believe the disappearance of Alicia has something to do with the investigation of your criminal? - I'm not sure, but this case has the same leads that the others do. - We must understand then that the official police hypothesis of the case is that Alicia was kidnapped by that insane man. - That's right, gentleman. - If that's true, please inform us of everything you know about that monster. - It's just we know almost nothing. - Even less than nothing. - Blue, we have to rescue Alicia. We have to do something and save her, but what? - Anything. She's our responsibility. Our teacher left her under our care and we can't fail him. - What are the police doing right now? - Right now our police officers are doing an intensive surveillance of the area to stop further disappearances, but when they have happened, as you have seen, we don't have any clues to follow. - I understand commissioner. Will you accept our help? - Your help is more than welcomed. - Let me warn you commander, if that murderous bastard falls into our hands... - We'll hand him over to you. - At least what is left of him, if there is anything at all. - I know how you feel. - We will like to talk to Professor Ruiz. - I don't think we will get much out of him. Quite frankly, he is an old man hindered by his age, but if that is what you wish, let's go. - She's stayed here very late while watching after some samples. When she finished, I offered to take her home you see, but she told me that it wasn't necessary and all that kind of things you say in situations like that. - She left by herself? - Yes, that's what she did. - And she didn't tell you anything that could explain her absence? For example, something she was doing or maybe going to a friend's house. - Oh yes, she told me she has a boyfriend. - Did she say who it was? - Let me think. I remember now. She told me her boyfriend was a wrestler named Santo. - I am that wrestler professor. - Oh so you're her beau. No no no no no, she told me it wasn't you. I remember now. She told me that she didn't have a boyfriend. - Thanks so much professor. - It was my pleasure to help you. I hope my information will be of great use. You know I would like to see the man who kidnapped your girlfriend jailed. - Excuse me professor. - See you later. - From which mad house can Professor Ruiz have escaped? (machinery humming) - I don't mind police wearing pants, but police wearing skirts confuses me. Cute and skilled detectives in charge of investigation. I have never trusted female intuition and these cute detectives are a nuisance I must eliminate. They must be my next victims. Have Golem bring them here. - Let's go. (suspenseful instrumental music) (ominous music) - Thank you very much. Come any time. - Of course see you later. - Later. (ominous music) - Did you notice? - Yes. (car engine revs) (ominous music) - Come on let's do it. (ominous music) (window shatters) - What has happened? - Take it easy. (ominous music) - Come on. (ominous music) - Shh, quiet. (ominous music) Take them away. - Get off me! - Let us go. (punches ringing out) (men grunting) - Golem, come now! (ominous music) (punches ringing out) (men grunting) - It's great that two ladies like us had to defend ourselves, but we thank you for defending us, right Carma? - Yes. - Your living room now looks like a disaster area. - Let's hand them over to police. - Shh. (ominous music) (grunts) (ominous music) That was marble and iron and look at it now. If he touches us, we are dead. - I think we are almost as good as dead. That must be the monster that slaughtered those policemen in four seconds. - Let's go, I have a plan. - Wake up. (grunts) (ominous music) Wake up. (grunts) (ominous music) Wake up. - Come on, let's go. Let's go. Pussies. (men moaning) (ominous music) (ominous music) - Go go. (gun shots ringing out) (ominous music) - The thing I don't understand is why Golem didn't kill those masked men. - I ordered Golem to do nothing more than protect you and that's what he did. You damn idiots! Useless! The newspaper and television won't take long to talk about my first failure. And that will really harm my reputation. I really need to do something to catch the public's eye, to erase this moment. - To think that Alicia is in the hands of that maniac. - Maybe he already transformed her into another of those walking zombies. - And to have to fight right now. - We don't have any choice. (knocks on door) - What is it? - Ready. - We're on our way. - And so begins one of the most anticipated tag teams matches, Santo and Blue Demon versus Angel and Valentino. Many fans in the crowd believe that Santo and Blue Demon could lose this match. The invincible tag team of Santo Blue Demon will be put to the test. Angel is a really strong wrestler. A great rudo with an incredible physique, weighing more than 220 pounds. But who still flies through the air, thanks to the skills of Blue Demon. He goes for the tag. Santo goes in. As does Valentino. Valentino's been waiting for this chance to fight Santo. He not only wants to defeat him, he wants to rip his mask to pieces. That is one of the biggest wishes of Valentino. Look at those rudo moves. He doesn't care about anything as long as he defeats Santo. Nice throw, Santo's the master of the camel clutch and the arm bars. He also has the skills to escape any bad situation, just like he did right now. Oh look at that, he's on his feet and counterattacks. Look at Valentino, he's been training for days and weeks for this great challenge. And how he uses a dangerous Boston crab. Oh Santo is able to break the move by using all the strength of his legs. As always, Santo and Blue Demon bring a lot of attractive ladies to the arena. Oh but Angel goes in and breaks the hold on Valentino. Angel goes in after the tag from Valentino. Santo looks like he never tires, oh but takes a heavy punch to the face. Angel almost broke his nose. Blue Demon is now receiving heavy blows if you can call it that from this monster who weighs over 220 pounds. However, Blue Demon is now quick on his feet. The match has barely started, but everyone is showing great moves and courage. There's the pin, one, two, three and Santo comes in with an Irish whip throw that slams Valentino against the mat. And here he goes, here comes Santo. Oh and now he uses one of his trademark arm bars and secures the win. The first fall goes to Santo and Blue Demon. Just listen to that sold out crowd ovation. And now the second fall begins. Sometimes you can't help but wonder how Santo can send someone has heavy as his opponent flying through the air. - Go Santo. - But now the odds are against him and the referee can't do anything to stop it, as the rudo side goes two on one. They are the worst. And now oh what an escape by Santo and now he goes to the arm bar. Sometimes Santo likes to wait, but he makes up for that with skill. Santo is pinned to the mat, but knew how to avoid the count. Oh, now a DDT. Blue Demon is cheering for his tag team partner. But now Santo is in danger in the lion's den. He needs help. Blue Demon gets sick of it and enters the fray like a bull. The other side had it coming. Santo and Blue Demon are doing the best they can to get the second consecutive fall on Angel and Valentino. Can Santo get rid of Valentino now that the odds are in his favor? Maybe not, now Santo is on the ground. Blue Demon is minding his own business, but now Santo strikes Valentino who doesn't stop fighting, but the crowd, but more importantly the ladies are worried for the technicals. And now here's a another chance. Santo, Blue Demon strike in unison, but the Rudos fight back. Terrible strikes and knees to the body of Santo, but Blue Demon goes in for the assist and the crowd screams. One of the Rudos needs to be put into submission first, but Valentino has tremendous stamina and has managed to withstand all the attacks from Santo. And now Santo receives a terrible head butt and body slam as Blue Demon gives up, oh heavy butt drop on Santo. One, two, three, the match is now tied. The second fall goes to Angel and Valentino. The third fall has begun. The stakes are high now. Valentino begins the match by throwing Blue Demon against the ropes and waiting for him with a heavy punch. Oh he might have broken Blue Demon's jaw. I can see some blood from his mouth. And Valentino doesn't stop, he keeps punching him. Santo worries for his friend and screams for him to ask for the tag. Angel in the other corner receives Blue Demon with tremendous kicks. Blue Demon finally tags with Santo, but Valentino now strikes Santo with horrible punch to the guts. - Detective Margo I just received this letter. It's urgent you get it to Santo right away. - Angel gets the tag though and in he goes. Blue Demon hasn't recovered yet. The international referee Matalai close to the action and he finally sends everyone to their corners. This amazing tag team continues takes this chance to recover I believe he's ready to go back in with all his might. There he is waiting. Here he comes, the idol of the crowd gets the tag now. Blue Demon can barely stand and now Angel faces Santo. Quick leg sweep and pin by Angel, looking for the victory, but Santo counterattacks with a reverse ankle lock, but now the lock is used against him as Angel flips the move, but wow look at that Santo reverses into a reverse arm and leg breaker move. The crowd screams give up Angel. They also scream for their idol Santo, Santo, but oh Valentino breaks the move and Blue Demon couldn't stop him and once again the referee Matalai couldn't stop the Rudos from cheating. Scissor hold to the neck of Angel. He tries to escape. The sold out crowd believes Santo will win. But once again Valentino like I said earlier will stop at nothing to defeat Santo and tearing his mask to pieces. Santo's tired, but he has an amazing recovery ability. He goes down to the mat looking to use his famous scissor hold, but Valentino escapes with ease, only to receive a kick to the chest. There's the pin, but Angel is really close and gives a cruel kick to the back of the head of Santo. All of these attacks have drawn blood from Santo's mouth. He's tired now. He's trapped in an arm lock. Now gets a hard blow to the ribs. Santo seems to be out of energy, but wow he escapes from the corner and now Angel is hit by La Santina, one of the most famous moves of the idol of the crowd. He throws him and he goes for it again. Angel is flying, crashes down on the mat. His back must be broken and now Santo's using his trademark camel clutch and Blue Demon enters to assist the move and make Angel give up, but no Valentino enters as well. Flying scissors, great move by Blue Demon, whoa it's amazing, Angel finally surrenders to the clutch as Blue Demon sets up Valentino to a head butt the crowd wants to see a legal win and Blue Demon gives it with a torture cradle. The invincible tag team has won. Victory for Santo and Blue Demon. - You should know that Ms. Alicia Robles is my guest. She is safe and her only wish is to go home. I will not have any problems fulfilling that wish if the famous wrestler Santo takes her place instead. If he accepts tomorrow at eight p.m. my personal vehicle will pick him up right in front of the building where detective Margo and Carma live. I advise if the police my vehicle, against my wishes Ms. Robles will be reduced to nothing more than a walking corpse. As you can see, it's signed by Doctor Frankenstein. - If this man is really Dr. Frankenstein, he would need to be over 100 years old. - If that murderer can make the dead walk, he might as well be Dr. Frankenstein or rather it has to be him. - Can we inform the commissioner that the killer is Dr. Frankenstein? - Yes, the commissioner will have to check for himself, but I believe Blue is right. - So Dr. Frankenstein huh? Sounds crazy, but we have to believe it. - We could have policemen follow that car if they go dressed as everyday civilians and they drive a common taxi. - Carmalita I bet Dr. Frankenstein thought about that too. If he notices he is being followed, there's no doubt he will kill Alicia. We are talking about a human life and I simply cannot take such a big risk. - I didn't think we would need the watches so soon. - I contact you with the watch, only when things get too dangerous or when he has released Alicia. - I will be ready, but what I really want is to personally see Dr. Frankenstein's face and then break it. (suspenseful instrumental music) - Hey boss, we have Santo with us. - Bring him to me. (grunts) I knew for sure you would honor your hero title and come to the rescue of the damsel. - And I knew I can't believe in your promise of releasing her. - (laughs) I can see you're very smart. - Only a fool would trust the words of a murderer. - To fight against death sometimes you have to kill, but you are right Santo, I won't keep my promise. Bring Alicia Robles with us. - Hmm. - As you can see, there are more of us. Also behind that door is the deadly Golem. (laughs) You already know him. - Santo! (grunts) (raucous instrumental music) (men grunting) - Let me go! - Don't use your guns. Remember I need him alive. (men grunting) (punches ringing out) - Oh, let me go, you bastard! (men grunting) (punches ringing out) (device beeps) (raucous instrumental music) - Santo if you don't surrender, Golem will rip Alicia apart. (ominous music) Take Alicia to her room. - Come here. Let's go. - And Santo to the operation room. There are three medical experts with special instructions to prepare you for a very important experiment. Take him away. (grunts) - And to think that just a few days ago they were right here with us in this same place. (watch beeps) - I have to go. I have no time to waste. Here, do me a favor and pay the bill. (eerie science fiction music) (bell chiming) (watch beeps) (eerie science fiction music) (bell chiming) (suspenseful instrumental music) (watch beeps) (suspenseful instrumental music) (watch beeps) (suspenseful instrumental music) (ominous music) (suspenseful instrumental music) - Wait. We're going to need a huge amount of anesthetic gas. We better get another tank. - I'll go get it. (eerie science fiction music) - Hey, new guy, connect the tank to the mask tube. What are you waiting for? (screams) (gun shots ringing out) (spray hisses) - I guess you notice I'm not an anesthetist. - Still you put them to sleep and I almost fell asleep too. - Did you find Alicia and Dr. Frankenstein? - Stay vigilant. Tonight I will perform the feat of doing an incredible important surgery and don't want to be interrupted, understood? (spray hisses) (men grunting) (punches ringing out) (coughs) What happened? (punch rings out) - The other, the other masked man came. - Surely before entering Blue Demon informed the police. It won't be long before an army comes here, but it doesn't matter. There's no time to lose. I will order Golem to escape through the secret passage. You go with him. - And you boss? - I don't need to escape. Guys. (men grunting) (raucous instrumental music) - Be careful. In this place, there is a surprise behind every door. - Santo! - Oh! - What did I tell you about surprises? - Now we have to keep searching this damn labyrinth until we find Frankenstein. Take a look at that. - Professor Ruiz? - What are you doing here professor? - A bunch of gangsters grabbed me and threw me into a car when I was leaving my laboratory. - We have to keep looking for Dr. Frankenstein. - Yes, but it's also time to contact the police. - The killer of the 12 young women is the legendary Dr. Frankenstein. Wrestlers Santo and Blue Demon were the ones who discovered and entered his lair. The police detained many men from that place who are now being strongly interrogated. The preserved frozen body of a beautiful woman was discovered and has been moved to the morgue. In the same place, a humongous man with brutish physique was freed. Unfortunately, Dr. Frankenstein was able to escape without a trace. Authorities were not able to find the monster who killed the four policeman either. We will continue informing you about this case. - My new objective is revenge. Santo and Demon will suffer humiliating death by the very hands of Golem in the same ring and coliseum that has been the stage of their triumphs. That way the deaths will be legal. - But master, Santo will recognize Golem because of his skin color. - I have a plan for that. I will change his skin pigmentation. - And now ladies and gentleman, it's time for sports news. To our country has come a colossus, a masked and mysterious wrestler who hides his identity under the frightening name Mortis. He has issued a direct challenge to Santo to a match where the winner will take home 100,000 pesos. Will Santo, the idol of the crowd accept? - You can tell the fans that I accept the challenge from that foreign fighter and I will do my best to win the match and take the prize. - Will the idol of the crowd accept the challenge? - I already accept it. We'll sign a contract soon. - Here comes Mortis. - What a big guy huh? - Mm-hmm. - Why do you hide your face behind that mask? - He doesn't understand you, because he doesn't speak English. He is Mortis's manager. - Whatever it takes to publicize a fight like this, right? - This way please. Santo I have the honor to introduce you to Mortis. Uh well let's sign that contract. - Go to the desk. - Okay. Your turn. - Sign the papers, Mortis. (ominous music) - Be really careful Santo. I don't know why, but I don't like that guy. He has a sinister aura. - Don't worry. I'm going to win. - I hope so, but don't lower your guard even for a second. - Ready? - Good luck. - Thank you. (crowd cheering) (crowd claps) - Santo, Santo, Santo! - No other man in the whole wrestling world has created so much expectation as Mortis, who easily weighs at least 130 pounds more than Santo. Look at this man, he is a monster. Santo is risking it all on this match, even his secret identity. Losing wouldn't be the only consequence against Mortis. Run, run from him. This is a mysterious opponent, but something is happening. Mortis seems to be keeping his distance. Santo is chasing him, trying to take him down, but Mortis simply keeps raising his arms trying to avoid the fight. Now attack, Santo hasn't been able to get ahold of Mortis and now the referee is scolding Mortis telling him to fight but he doesn't care. However, he's starting to use some weird and illegal moves. He strikes Santo through. And now he's trying to rip the mask off of Santo. The referee gets between them and stops Mortis, scolding him for breaking the rules. The stakes are through the roof in this match. There's mystery in the air tonight. Me, the crowd and everyone else is captivated by that mystery. Mortis is fighting Santo with all his might and the crowd is cheering Santo, Santo, Santo. - Get over here! (screams) (grunts) What are you doing here you bastard? What are you doing here? - Nothing. - I don't believe you. You are planning something. Tell me, tell me now. Who is Mortis? - I don't know. Let me go. - If you don't tell me who is the man with the black mask I will break this arm and then I will do the same with the other. (screams) Now speak. I don't have time, nor patience for this, who is Mortis? You want to tell me, yes or no? - Okay, okay, Mortis is Golem. - Oh, he is that monster, huh? - Yes, now let me go. - And who is the manager? (screams) Tell me who is Mortis's manager? - The manager is, Mortis's manager is Dr. Frankenstein. (screams) Just let me go, let me go. - Come, move along. - Let me go. - Santo is being crushed with an unstoppable bear hug by Mortis. Mortis gives it all he's got... - Finish him off Golem. - Oh no, strikes the referee and he's out cold. Now Santo is putting every ounce of strength that he has left in each strike, but all of that and all of his courage haven't been enough to weaken Mortis. The crowd and all of us watching this match are scared for Santo. He's now being strangled by Mortis. He uses his gigantic hands to try and choke Santo. - Officer, take this man. - Okay Blue. - Come on let's go. - He's choking Santo. This could cost him his life. The idol of the crowd is in lethal danger. - Golem, come to me now. - But now Mortis stops the attack on Santo and is leaving the ring. Everyone in the arena is shocked. Meanwhile Santo is finally recovering from the attacks. (men grunting) (punches ringing out) - What's going on? Any idea? - That black masked man is Golem. And his manager is Frankenstein. What do we do? - This is bad. - Which way did he go? - Through there. - Let's go. (raucous instrumental music) - Any plan? - Think we can get him down. - It won't be easy, but you know let's just do it. - Let's go. (raucous instrumental music) (screams) (crowd screams) (screams) (crowd talking) - Get back, get back. Don't go any closer, stay back. (crowd talking) Stay there. (crowd gasps) (crowd talking) (ominous music) (crowd talking) - There calm down Alicia. Tomorrow we will think all of this was just a nightmare. (ominous music)
