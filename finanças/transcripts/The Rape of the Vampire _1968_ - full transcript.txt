The Rape Of The Vampire A two-part melodrama Listen. Listen, listen to me. You know who I am even though you can no longer see. Listen to me and do as I say. You and your sisters must be careful, because your misfortunes will begin again if you do not do as I say. The arrival of three strangers will be your ruin. They will use different methods to try to bring about your destruction. The most dangerous of them will say he wants to cure you. He will steal your soul if you listen to his lies. If you speak to him, he will steal your immortality. Listen to me. No matter what he says or does, do not listen to him. Tonight, with humility, you will go to the statue of Traybas. You must! You must satisfy the appetites of the demons coming to you. The strangers are coming. They will come to see me first. I will tell them about you and your past. I will tell them everything they need to know about the four vampire sisters. I will recount the legend for them. Shine some light on her heart. Gentlemen had previously fought vampires during the reign of Louis XV, but they neglected to sever the head from the body. The she-devil had three vampire sisters who looked after her. The legend continues into the beginning of our century when some peasants got together to hunt the devil's sisters. They raped one of the sisters near the castle, and tracked down another until dawn. The sunrise would have killed her, but one of the men had gouged out her eyes with his pitchfork, and so, she survived. That is how the four vampire sisters come to be alive today. That's if the legend is true. Hello. Is there anybody there? It will soon be dark. - Why did you come alone? - They are crazy, Marc, crazy! You don't mind staying here? - The village isn't far. - No, this is fine. We can stay in this room. Put the torch in the window. We must let them know we're here. You think you can cure them? Those poor creatures are not crazy, nor are they vampires. These four girls have been driven mad by centuries of hate and superstition. What about the lord of the manor? I must admit I don't really know where he fits in. What are you looking at? They are here. You'd like to go up, wouldn't you? But after what happened to you, you are afraid of men. Do you remember? You should remember. They threw you to the ground, they tore open your dress. - And then... - Be quiet! They will do the same, if they catch you. Be quiet! A knife? You carry a knife now? Death! Death to those two men and to that woman! Death to all those who persecute us! Your days are spent in a state of catalepsy, that is why you feel exhausted. Vampires don't exist. You don't even bear all the marks. Here's the proof. You're just afraid of daylight, but you two are not. You, you are afraid of men because of what you believe happened to you fifty years ago. You, you drink the blood from birds, but none of you spends the daytime in a coffin. You are not vampires. I just met the lord of the manor, here in the woods. Everything he said confirmed my suspicions. I will cure them, but I need your help. Do you think we can trust him? No, but who can we trust? Their lies aren't deliberate, they have become a habit. They have been surrounded by crosses. To fight their illness we must fight its creator. If anything happens to Brigitte, you will pay for it. That's enough! We must put a stop to this. Take this. Take it... in both hands. She's afraid of daylight, you could have been more careful. - Get out of here. - What harm are they doing? You too persecute them because they are different. Different? They're crazy lunatics who should be locked up. You make me laugh with your trendy psychoanalysis. That's for snobs and intellectuals. We lock up crazy people, pal, and put them in the shower. You are the ones who are crazy. Help me clear up all this nonsense. Most powerful god, you see your statue destroyed. Mystery pierced, the temple desecrated. The flight and the clamor of the helpless. What are you saying? Very well, off you go now. What can we do? Please, tell me what must be done. Tell me. You are no longer afraid of crosses. You will see you have nothing to fear from the daylight. Before sunrise tomorrow, I will wait for you on the pathway. Are they still at the manor? They've destroyed the crosses, Master. They must die. Kill them, before they kill us. Kill them? I have always helped you... protected you from the peasants. You must believe me. You are vampires. - But last night... - You must accept the way it is. We are all damned souls, haunted by our desires. You're going to kill him before he can save us? Let go, I have to do it. He isn't there, he's waiting for me on the grounds. I'm going to meet him, he will cure me. You traitor! They must die. Have you forgotten the gentleman who stabbed you 200 years ago? The past is dead, we must live on. You must die, because I am a vampire. And you will die, if you betray us. She is dead. Dead? Who is dead? How did this happen? She can't die. He has freed the vampires. He's a dangerous madman, he has destroyed the crosses. He is bringing misfortune down on us. One of the sisters has already been killed. Your wives and your children will be next. Enough, we're leaving tonight. Two days here is already too many. I think Thomas is right, they are just unfortunate creatures. "Unfortunate creatures"? Crazy people always have a nasty effect on me. We'll leave after lunch. - So, get your things together. - Fine, I'm going to the village. What happened? Nothing. I thought I had won. I was wrong. Come on, we have to go. Try to salvage something. Brigitte! Are you leaving? You can come with us, if you like. - I'm taking your sisters. - We really must leave. - I can't leave, I am blind. - Why? A long, long time ago, maybe even sixty years ago... When you were a child? No, I was as I am today. Let's go, you filthy beast, we must leave immediately! I'm the one who's in danger. Go on. Let's get out of here. That's enough blood, enough! I remember it well. They threw my sister to the ground, and came at me with the fork. Why did they do that? They hate us because we're different, vampires. - How many were there? - I can't remember. - Picture that day. - I can see it. - Describe the peasants. - I can't, it's all a blur. - Was your sister with you? - She was raped. - By whom? - I don't know. - What color were your eyes? - Green. - They are grey now. - You're lying. - How long was your hair? - Shoulder length. - Do you cut it? - No. Why hasn't it grown since? - It has! - No. You can't remember because you weren't there. It was someone else. It was me! - It was someone else. - It was me! That person is dead. Vampires don't die! - Vampires don't exist. - Yes, they do! She is dead! Look at this. It was her, look! It isn't you in that photograph. I don't know who tried to convince you you're blind, but it's part of some foul scheme. They must all be destroyed. They are monsters! They killed my wife! Come on! They're here, we have to escape. But I want you to know that I don't think you are a monster. I want you... to know that, right now. Give me the kiss of the vampire. You bitch! This can't be true, Thomas. I don't believe it. Marc, put the gun down. They killed Brigitte, and now you... They didn't kill anyone. This strange illness isn't just a mental illness. I was wrong. I was wrong all along. Vampires do exist. It's not a curse, it has never been a curse. It's an illness. You and your stories! It's your fault Brigitte is dead! Don't come any closer! I don't feel any curse inside of me. I will find a cure. We are not damned, I promise you. - The house is surrounded. - I know a secret passage. Hurry. Part Two... The Vampire Women. I killed them. It had to be done. Brigitte is dead too, did you know? All I can do now is go home. You are lucky to still be alive. You're forgetting the four sisters, and Mathieu, and the others. You and your friend are the ones who awakened the powerful forces. Go now. Go now and forget all this. Well, sir? Yes, I know, I have failed. Kneel, kneel before your queen. It was that doctor, it was all his fault. Do you know how difficult it was to find those four girls? Do you know what great hopes I had for them? Do you know how close I was to succeeding? Do you know what I do to traitors? No, have mercy, have mercy! Show some mercy! Go on. Because of his incompetence, we will have to start again. But first, disguise those corpses. Destroy their clothes, and make sure they will remain dead forever. Don't forget, they, too, are vampires. You know what you have to do. What we just did must remain a secret, even from our queen. If you let anything slip, if you say anything at all, I will take you to the secret chamber and there... Do I need to explain? Let's go. I rise up from the dead, without coming back to life. You have to help me. Help me. Help me choose, help me. My time as a man has become a distant memory... a time when I had no need of blood to quench this unbearable thirst. What happened to make me this way? How did this happen to you? I can't remember. Just the manor, that dreadful manor house. And nothing before that. Everything was white. Maybe it was before I was born. Yes, a woman, imposing and strict, leaning towards me. Then whiteness. Even the men. Even the women. Even the men were white. It's all merged together. The house, the men... The masks, the white masks! And that woman. We'll find that woman. She can tell us how to find a cure. Trust me. Oh no! No! There's nothing to be afraid of. I have cleaned your wound. The bullet missed the lung. There are no signs of infection. Don't worry, everything will be fine. May I leave now, Mistress? You are avenged. Your sister thought she had killed you, but you are alive. However, she is dead, as is that psychoanalyst. Others also died, and I want that to be the case for all the witnesses. - You will help me in this task. - Very well, I will obey you. The body of one of your sisters is still missing. She may still be alive. The peasants claim to have seen her staggering along, crazed, bloody and dirty, her clothes ripped to shreds. And the blood spurting out of her eyes. They thought she was a ghost. We will turn her into a corpse. Yes, Mistress, as you wish. I need the body of a woman who recently died violently. If I succeed in transforming her into a living-dead woman... who or what could stand in my way? Who or what could stand in my way now? Be strong, so that you may serve me better. Get out. I've already told you to leave my patients alone. "My patients"! He thinks he's our queen! Our queen wants to see this patient, tonight. And now, we're going. They're here. All right, I'll take care of them. Now we are both quite alone. Just the two of us, abandoned. It's over. They will never find us. We will go far, far away from here. But now we have to eat. We must eat to get our strength up. My sweet, come on, a spoonful. And another one. Eat up. That's it. Have some more. I'll sing a little... for both of us. In my big crystal palace, the sun shines freely and at night, the pale moon shines its soft light "Princess, my beloved princess," a kind gentleman said to me, "Your face is a cameo, with your beautiful dewy eyes." There we go. You can sleep now. We were successful, Mistress, but Marc is in the cemetery. He could find out any minute now what we have done. Should we follow him? No, it's not necessary. He will come back when I want him to. Let's go home. Seems you didn't tell me everything. There you are, kind gentleman. You haven't forgotten about your princess. It is time to leave my crystal palace. Get rid of her. Look. Watch out, he's getting closer. I hope you didn't mind having to wait for us, Princess. I would sing and gaze at myself to see if my beauty was still dazzling. I hope you didn't wear your eyes out from crying! You're so beautiful. We have made you the most magnificent dress. Thank you. I want to be worthy of my kind gentleman. Which of us do you chose as your husband? Whoever you can catch will be the chosen one. Over here! Over here, beautiful lady! Farewell, beautiful crystal palace! I am soon to be married. I shall return to the nuptial bed of the most handsome gentleman. Our queen will be pleased. No one will be any the wiser! We're initiated! Where are you? Maybe now the queen will initiate us. Yes, it will soon be the season for embracing. The season for embracing! She will be celebrating many unions. Maybe she'll marry the new couple, since they are already initiated. Which new couple? The ones our mistress found on the beach. The psychoanalyst and the girl? Yes, but it's a secret, they're at the clinic. That would be a lovely wedding. Doctor, I have come to request your help. You swine! Don't think that... Listen to me. We are all in the same boat. We are prisoners, too. I don't believe you. Or else, why won't you rid us of this dreadful thirst? Assure me I will have your help. Never, never! Let me tell you something. The doctor and I have been in love for a long time. Several years ago, the vampire queen asked us to look after this clinic so she could carry out research on the living dead. We had to accept it. Why? Because the queen made me what I am, a vampire. We have been searching for an antidote for seven years. But the danger has never been greater than it is now. Help us, I beg you. Thank you, I think we will succeed. That is how she betrayed me? But are you lying so that you may take her place, so that I can entrust you with the gift of immortality? And if she has betrayed me, I will find out, don't worry. And if you are lying, be afraid, be afraid. I will find out. Bring her to me as soon as possible. Hypertrophy, as we feared. Reduction of the stomach and the intestine. Do you see how big the heart is? Look there. Yes, there. That must be it, the pancreas. We are close to finding a solution. If we hope to succeed, we must save this woman quickly. She will be the first one to benefit from the antidote. I need a sample of skin. Take a sample. Yes, quickly! Go on. I think I've managed to isolate the bacteria. I won't keep you long. I sent for you, so I could ask you a question. I shall help you in any way I can. What is the question? It's just a minor thing. Why did you betray me? Me? But I haven't. You will talk. No, I don't want to. Come, try not to lie to us. No, I can't! I'm sure this formula is correct, but it needs to be activated. Do it quickly. Have a look at this. This time... Yes, that's it! Have a look at it. Take him to the operating room. What's the matter? Oh, I understand. Well done. What's wrong, my poor darling? You're going to have an early night to be rested for tomorrow. Here, I went to the dry cleaners. Here are your trousers. I think I'll take my red dress. What do you think? - I'm going to... - Brigitte? Brigitte? How on earth is it possible? No, I don't understand. And yet I'm certain... Is it really possible? But, Marc, what's wrong? Don't you remember? Oh, I remember. My God, how...? Marc? Marc, what's wrong? Try to remember. We're supposed to be going away tomorrow for a few days, to the country, with Thomas. Thomas! Are you kidding! You're not well. I'll phone Thomas. We'll see him and his four girls another time. Leave it. Brigitte, Brigitte, Is it really you, Brigitte? I feel better now. Are you sure? Do you feel better now? You don't want me to call him? No, everything's fine. If you don't mind, I'm going over to see Ali. I said I'd drop in on Wednesday, but since we're going away... Go ahead, you're right. See you later. I won't be long. Please, try hard. Get off the table. You have to come and free me. I had to do it. You can see that I, too, am their prisoner. Set me free, I will put an end to all these terrible crimes. Please, hurry. I'll make them pay for her as well. Such monsters don't deserve any sympathy. And I am one of them. You are dead, but alive. I support you as you walk. Your spirit is dead. Your spirit... is now mine. It is my strength that moves your limbs. You are dead, but alive. I support you with all my strength. You are dead, but alive. My magnetism is your soul. Your limbs obey me. Your spirit obeys me. You are dead, but... Me, it's me. It's impossible. I killed you. I killed her. I killed her. The day has come. The time has come to seal the union of the imminent triumph of the immortal race. This wedding of blood opens up the doors to the world. The great mystery is soon to take place. Another chosen one will sit among us. Many more will follow us and taste immortality. The world will become a feast of blood and we will have the best seats, we, the vampires, of whom I am queen. Semizahe! Faithful ones, take your places, Let the blood wedding begin! Through love and death, we find true life, eternal life. Die. Die, so that you may live again. Let us rejoice, my brothers. Mistress! Mistress, you are triumphant. Your Majesty, you are betrayed. The antidote. It's ready, we have to try it. Do you think it will work? We have to try it. I am not a vampire... any more! She's dead. She took the antidote. Its effectiveness is indisputable. It destroys vampires. But... we never thought... about this. We might as well be dead already, imprisoned in this cellar. Nothing of life can reach us now, no more contact with the living. To suffer less... We won't be tempted to quench our thirst on others. How long will it be before we can truly die? Forgive me for your suffering. There is nothing to forgive, it wasn't your fault. I love you. Dead. They are all dead. Just like Brigitte, just like me. Poison in the bottles of blood. The queen is dead. I saw her dragging herself along on the floor. They are all dead! All of them! I am the little boy who went to fish your scarf out of the sea. The presbytery has not lost its appeal, nor the garden its radiance, I can see it. I return to the radiating shadows of death. Many wise people would say that once you are dead, you are dead. They are convinced of it, congratulations. Congratulations. I wouldn't disagree with them. They will talk about it tomorrow from the depths of their tombs. Dear, dear, dear Cordelia. Dear, dear, dear Cordelia. Dear, dear, dear Cordelia.
