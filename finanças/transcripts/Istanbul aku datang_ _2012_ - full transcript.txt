Wow, the Aya Sofya is so beautiful. One of the most magnificent buildings in the world. I can't believe I'm able to take my wedding pictures here. I'm so excited! Hi, sweetheart. Are you here? The photographer is already here. What? Cancel our wedding? Sweetheart? I guess it was just a dream. I'm probably too excited about having our wedding pictures taken. What's more, at the most special place... filled with memories! Okay. I admit... The first time I came to Istanbul, I'd only one mission in mind. To become Azad's fiancée! I had to wait six years for my boyfriend to finish medical school before thinking of marriage? Sorry, but I'm not the type who likes waiting around. So, my plan is to come to Istanbul for a short course at the same university as Azad, and within three months, arrange for him to propose to me. Then we'll get married ASAP. Isn't my plan great? Isn't that beautiful? That's Aya Sofya. I can't wait! Hello. Sweetheart! Who's this? He helped me with my luggage. Peace be with you. And with you. -How many times must I tell you? -What? Don't trust strangers so easily. What if he ran away with your bags? What then? Don't be so quick to judge. He was sincere in helping me. Sincere? If he was sincere, he wouldn't have taken the tip. What was I to do? I couldn't carry all these bags myself. I tried calling you, but you didn't answer. So you're going to trust every guy who looks sincere then? What if he was a thief... or a kidnapper? Do you even think about all that? I came all this way because I missed you. Can you not be upset? That's why I didn't want you to come. You know I'm busy. The medical course is not easy. Now, I have to take care of you too. Fine. I can take care of myself anyway. Are you sulking? I was upset because I care. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been bothered. D... I'm happy you came. My reunion with A was not at all how I imagined it to be. I was expecting to be pampered after being apart for six months. I got an earful from him instead. A said that my being here makes him more stressed. He's got to study hard but has to worry about me too. So, I'll prove to him that I can take care of myself and won't be a burden. In fact, I'll show him all the benefits of having me here. I guarantee that he'll propose before I go back to KL. God willing. Wish me luck, guys. XOXO, D -Food. -Smells great. Who cooked? Beautiful! When a person is sleepy, he gets tucked in. When a person is hungry, he gets to tuck in to food. It's awesome you're here. We'll eat good food every day. Hey, you shameless fool. Did she say it's for you? Don't worry, I cooked for everyone. Let's eat. That's music to my ears. Hurry, let's eat. Hi, baby. Let's eat, I cooked your favorite dish. Hey, hurry up. Food waits for no man. Hey, you did my laundry? It's nothing, not like I have anything to do today. Baby, can I follow you to the university tomorrow? I want to register for my course. Okay, but I'm busy tomorrow. I can't accompany you for long. I'll accompany you to the Language Institute. After you've registered, you can find your own way home. I was hoping to visit your faculty. Can't you have lunch with me? Baby, you know I'm busy. Didn't you say you can take care of yourself? I told you not to come but you came anyway. You said you would like to learn Turkish here. I don't mind, but if you expect me to be with you all day every day for the next three months, it's going to be tough. Let's focus on what we each have to do and I'll take you out when I have time. Okay? Okay. I promise I won't be a burden. -So... -Yeah? Have you found your own place? My own place? You're not thinking of staying here, are you? What? Can't I? Baby, you're a girl. You can't stay with three guys. That's not possible. Who cares? We're not doing anything wrong. We may not be sleeping in the same room but what would people think? It doesn't reflect well on us. Find your own place tomorrow. Istanbul, so romantic. Don't worry, my boyfriend's like that too. He's too serious when it comes to work. But guys like that are the best. They have a sense of responsibility. God willing, you'll get your ring soon. Don't pamper him. Girls need to play hard to get. Drive a hard bargain. Show him that it's not all about him. Play hard to get and he'll come after you. That's speaking from experience. Sweetheart, this is fantastic. It's cold. D, I'm late. The Language Institute is over there. Just follow the path to the end. I've got to rush to class. You're not going to walk me there? I can't. I've got to go. My faculty is far away. I'll see you at home tonight. You can't even do lunch? Baby, what did you promise me last night? Go meet your classmates and get to know them. Okay? Okay, sweetheart. -Okay, bye. -Bye, sweetheart. Dian! Don't forget to look for a place. I won't. EUROPE Satisfaction. Another helping? No way. If I stretch my stomach any more, it'll burst, and I'll die. What's on the menu tomorrow, Mom? You're so thick. Take advantage while she's here. Right, Dian? Yeah, especially since I'll be moving out soon. Huh? You're moving out? Why? Just stay... If she moves out, it'll be our loss. Yeah, our loss. Nadim, help me wash up in the kitchen. -Thanks, Dian. It was delicious. -Welcome. -D... -Yeah? Have you found a place yet? Not yet. It's not easy. Everything is either too expensive or too far out. The good ones are all taken. There are many more places. Tomorrow you can continue looking. But it's okay if I stay here just a while longer, right? Nadim and Ljoi seem to be alright with it. I'm not worried about those two. It's the other Malaysian students. It's best you move out before your course starts. When your course starts, you'll be too busy. -Okay? -Okay. So, plan A is stuck. Basically, I've got to move out. Reason being, what others will say about a girl living with three guys and so on... Who cares what people say as long as we're not doing anything wrong? But my paranoid boyfriend insists that I move out. So I need a new plan. Who knows, if I show A that I can live without him, maybe he'll realize that he can't live without me! Oh, my God. How are you? I am good. Thank you. You are welcome. Check it out. Isn't my new apartment cool? It's seriously beautiful. And the best part, no housemate! Oh, my God, you guys would be horrified if you saw the other places I looked at this morning. Some were filthy, others had obnoxious landlords. I can prepare a romantic dinner for A. -Crazy girl. -Crazy idiot. -You're Malaysian. -You're Malaysian. Hey, listen, Miss Malaysia... I don't know how you got the keys to this apartment, but this is my apartment, so please leave. You listen, Mr. Whatever, I've already paid three months’ deposit so this is my apartment. So you had better leave. Don't be so rude. You're the one who should not be rude. I'll settle this with the landlord and let him kick you out. Kick you out! You! Hold on! Peace be with you. Is Mr. Sulaiman old or young? Hey, old, of course. Haven't you met him? Who did you rent it from then? From him, of course. I'm just confirming. It's ringing. He's not picking up. Mr. Sulaiman? Mr. Sulaiman? Hello? Cihan. Cihan! Do you know when Mr. Sulaiman will be back? Cihan? Where the hell are you? Don't you get it? Even if I were to move, I don't have the money. I've already paid three months’ deposit for this apartment. So like it or not, I'm staying put. Okay, we'll see about that. It's okay, you're busy. I can't be bothering you just because of this. I'll manage on my own. I don't have much stuff. You should have waited until I saw the place first. Whether it's okay or not, what's provided and what's not. What's the address? I'll come over. No! You can't come over. Why not? Because... my housemate is very strict. Men are not allowed. Is your housemate an Arab? Yes, she is. That's a good guess. Yeah, Arab girls are very strict. But that's good. She can look out for you. Puts me at ease. D, do you want to have lunch with me tomorrow? Sure! I'll pick you up by the Language Institute, okay? Okay, I'll wait for you. Someone else is living in this apartment. And it's a guy! I don't have money for another place. And my landlord ran away with my money! Oh, my God! I'm dead if A finds out I'm living with a man. So dead! Okay... deep breath. A will never find out. I'll make sure he doesn't. Anyway, it's just for three months. Hopefully by then, A will have already proposed, and I can go back to Malaysia. Yes, that's the plan. Guys, please pray for me! KARAKÖY ISTASYONU STATION Hey. Don't be so rude next time. Knock before you open. Don't just barge in! Then lock the door next time. What, it's fine that you barged in on me yesterday? Pervert. You'd better apologize. Apologize now! You! Go clean the toilet! Clean it now! D, please don't hug in public. What would people think? You were fine hugging me in KL. That's different. We're in a foreign country. An Islamic country for that matter. Show some respect. Let's go eat. I'll take you to somewhere special. Didn't you say no hugging... have some respect... We were in the middle of campus. There's nobody here, so it's okay. Don't be like that. Don't make a fuss over nothing. A story of me and her Starting with her charming eyes She makes my day So perfect without any troubles At night I am troubled On the day we're not together Thanks so much for lunch. My apartment is just there. Just drop me off here. Otherwise you'll miss the bus. -Drop you off here? -Yeah. It's okay, I'll see you to your door. Why? Are you worried that your Arab housemate will see you? Just tell her that we're engaged. Engaged? If we're engaged, she can't be upset seeing us like this. Tell a white lie. Tell a white lie? See how white you get when I circumcise you again! Fresh corn! Delicious corn! Come and have a taste! Baby, I want some corn. Two corns, please. What? -Baby, here you go. -Flies everywhere. -Flies, baby. -Flies? I've got to go. Ljoi forgot his house keys. Cat! Crazy woman. Off you go. Sweet corn! Fresh corn! Come and have a taste! My boyfriend will flip if he finds out my housemate is a guy. Is your housemate handsome? Poor you. So...? It's been over a week... Any sign of the ring? Be quiet! You don't have to shout. Filth bag! Spraying pee all over and not cleaning up. I have to do it! Okay, calm down. Let every challenge motivate me. The sooner A proposes, the sooner I can go home... Welcome! -One. -One? God, almighty! I beg you to give this poor creature a bite of bread. Thank you, Lord. Now could I have a car, please? Whose Maggi Assam Laksa is that? I was starving. Sorry, I'll replace it. Maggi Assam Laksa is only available in Malaysia! Don't be rude! Thank God it's only that. No wonder he freaked out when I moved in. He's worried about his secret. Poor thing. Come to think of it, no wonder he was upset when I ate his food. Gay guys are fussy about their food. But gay guys are usually clean and tidy. But this guy is messy. I get it. This is his tactic to make me leave. I'll show him that he doesn't need to worry. I'm not the type that judges people. If we can be friends, I won't have to stress. Furthermore... Tomorrow, I'll invite him for lunch. You? Are you home? You? You? You? ANDERSEN FAIRY TALES THE FABLES OF LA FONTAINE -Sorry. -Get out. Get out! Dian. Hey, Ljoi. -Dian, are you looking for Azad? -Yeah. He's not home. I'll just wait for him at the apartment. But you'll be all alone. Join me for lunch? Come on. -Ljoi. -Yeah. Can I ask you something? About what? How does one apologize to a guy? Is Azad angry with you? Not Azad. It's my housemate. I mean, my neighbor. Have you tried talking to him? I don't dare to. Why not? He doesn't like me. He's always upset with me. Why do you want to apologize to him then? This time... it's my fault. Okay. If it's your fault, just right what you've done wrong. Okay. It's Azad. Baby, I came to your apartment. What time will you be back? You should've told me you were coming. I'm not coming home tonight. I've got practicum. I'll be staying over at the hospital. I haven't seen you in ages. I miss you. I know... I miss you too. But studies come first, right? Next time, call me before coming over. Then you won't have wasted your time. I'll take you out when I'm free. Azad is not coming home tonight. He has to stay at the hospital. It's okay... you can go guy-watching. My girlfriend says Turkish guys are handsome. Seriously, you should enjoy yourself while you're here. Dig in. Ljoi, can you get Maggi Assam Laksa in Istanbul? Maggi Assam Laksa? Yeah. You? Relax, Dian. Just apologize. You? You're back. Whose cat is that? Mine. That's Bujal. This is Atan. -I'm scared of cats. -What? I'm scared of cats! -Scared of cats? -Yes! Poor you, she's scared of you. That means you have to move out, right? Joyah seems to like you. Are you mad? I can't see! Get off me! Get off me! Okay, off you go, guys. Stop it! My eyes! Get off me! Get off me! You're mean! YOU I was wrong. I've never done it before and will never do it again. A million times sorry. -Yes, baby. -Are you okay? Where are you? Yes, I am. Just on my way home. I'm on my way to your apartment. I'll be there soon. It's number 7, 4th floor, right? -Yes, but... -Ljoi told me about your neighbor. Let me talk to him. How dare he yell at you. I'll wait for you at the apartment. Bye. Your housemate is an Arab? A strict Arab who won't let me visit. Baby, please listen. He's not my housemate. Then? -Your boyfriend? -No! I don't even know him. Trust me! You don't know him, yet you can bring him home. And allow him to be half naked. That doesn't bother you? Baby, let me explain. What else don't I know? You were the one who called me just now? I don't have time... Hey... Another guy that you don't know? This is Harris. My housemate. Wow. That's why I didn't tell you. I knew you'd be like this. Like what, Dian? Like an idiot? Dian, I trusted you. And this is what I get? Baby, I got conned! I don't have money to find another place. -That's your excuse? -I'm not making excuses! I'm not trying to make you look stupid. Harris is gay. That guy you saw is his boyfriend. If you guys want to argue or fight, just leave me out of it. You, please get out. I've nothing else to say. Baby! Baby, please wait. Wait! Baby, please wait. Is this the young lady you ripped off? Come here now. Come on! I'll show you! -Quick! -Baby! Baby! Have you spent all the money? -I will make you pay double the amount! -Uncle Suleiman, please. Thank you. I didn't go to the police for the sake of your lovely mother. Please, Uncle Suleiman! You don't have to evict me. I'll pack my things now. You, hold on. So, where will you go? Wherever. Maybe a hotel. Can't you stay with your boyfriend for a night or two? Do I still have a boyfriend? He won't listen to anything I have to say anymore. Anyway, sorry for all the trouble these past two weeks. Please forgive me? Let me talk to your boyfriend. Talk to him? What are you going to say? That you were conned, that you had no money... That's why you had to stay here with me. Even if he doesn't believe you, he might listen to me. Are you really going to do that for me? Yes. Furthermore, I feel bad for you. It's not your fault. You're a victim of circumstance. I won't believe your boyfriend is that stubborn until he refuses to understand. -Okay, let's go. -Let's go. Ljoi, is Azad here? Come on in. -Have a seat. -Okay. Azad. Baby... Baby, please listen to our explanation. Please. "Our"? Bro, seriously, hear us out. Bro? Don't make me laugh. You've had your way with her and now you want to pass her back to me? Hey, brother, don't assume anything. We had to stay together but don't jump to conclusions. Me? I'm jumping to conclusions? I saw her with strange men at the apartment. One is half naked, the other breathless. What was that? Isn't she a tramp? Bro, okay. I know you're angry now... but please, don't be so rude, okay? She's your girlfriend. Respect her. If she's a tramp... what's there to respect? If not a tramp... then she's a whore! Hey, bastards like you give men a bad name. Apologize to her now! What if I don't? Why are you defending her, anyway? Who do you think you are? -Her sugar daddy? -Oh, he's too much. Who are you calling sugar daddy? Stop! Baby! Baby! Baby! Stop! Baby! Stop! A lot of crazy girls today. You! You! I told you not to come but you came anyway. I don't mind but if you expect me to be with you all day every day for the next three months, it'll be tough. Baby, don't hug me in public. What would people think? Dian, I trusted you and this is what I get? You? You're welcome. It's my fault that you got punched. Are you okay? The bruise looks bad. This? It's nothing. It just looks bad... It's not even painful. Okay. I'm going back to Malaysia. What? When? Tomorrow morning. I've already booked my flight. Oh. Istanbul is not for me. Bad things have kept happening to me ever since I arrived. I've had enough. It's best I go home. You... Since it's your last day here... I'll take you out. It's fine. You've done enough for me. No, I didn't do much at all. Furthermore, your bad experiences include me as well, right? It's a waste if you have to leave before experiencing the real beauty of this place. Okay? Are you ready? Let's go. -I need to get some stuff. -For what? Gifts. Harris! Hey. -Isn't that...? -My boyfriend? Right? You like to jump to conclusions, right? -He's my model. -Model? I'm a children's book illustrator. I'm working on The Adventures of Sinbad. And Omar is my model. Oh, my God. I'm so stupid. Here, here! -Peace be with you, Malik. -And with you. Well, well, well. Okay. Here you go. Did you like it? Watch it, watch it, watch it! So? Do you still hate Istanbul? I don't know. Part of me feels that... it would have been better had I not come. But if I didn't come... maybe I would never have known... how foolish and gullible I am. Foolish? How could a fool be independent? Even when you got cheated, you still didn't depend on others. When you had problems with your cute and "gay" housemate... you still handled it on your own. The best part was that... you managed to find Maggi Assam Laksa in Istanbul. I salute you for that. But... in the end... I was still being lied to. By the person I trusted the most. But who hasn't been lied to? I lied to my mom when I played truant. But that doesn't mean my mom was a fool. We trust people easily, especially our loved ones. Okay. If your girlfriend did that to you... what would you do? Actually, it did happen to me. Wow. I would never have guessed. Never would have guessed? That I had a girlfriend? That a guy as outspoken as you could get bitten as well. Who can guarantee that they won't get hurt. What did you do? I forgave her. Why? Two people that are meant for each other will not easily be torn apart. We broke up in the end anyway. Because of other reasons. But... it's not the same as your story. What's the difference? I didn't get yelled at like you did, and humiliated in front of others like you were worthless. I can't accept that. Because that reflects what kind of person he really is. So, forget about men like him. You're too good for him. Azad. I want to talk to you... alone. Why? So that you can humiliate her again? This is none of your business. -This is between me and my girlfriend. -Oh... But I've never seen you treat her as your girlfriend. -You... -Azad. Will you be okay if I talk to him for a little while? -I know that you're angry. -I'm not angry. I'm sad. Forgive me. I didn't mean to hurt you. -I... -You what? I was lonely. I was on my own. Away from my family... away from you. Back home, I could talk to you every day. See you every day. But without all of that I... felt empty. I've broken up with Melis. So... just like that, everything is okay? Please, Melis means nothing to me. My heart... always belonged to you. We've been together for so long. Will you just throw it all away? I'm throwing it away? What were you thinking when you were with her? Trust me... if I could turn back time... if I could do it all over again... if I knew then how it would feel... to lose you... I... I'm going back to KL tomorrow. I'll go too. What about your course? Are you going to just drop it? There are medical courses in KL. What are you saying? Dian, please. I don't want to be apart from you again. I'm lost without you. I need you. Please forgive me? I don't want anyone else. I want us to be together. Until the end of time. I know I don't deserve you. And I know you're too good for me. But even if I have to keep trying for a hundred years, I will. If I have to ask you a thousand times, I will. Dian... will you take me to be yours forever? You? Were you waiting for me? I remembered that you didn't have a key. -Are you okay? -Huh? I'm okay. New ring? Azad asked me to marry him. And you said yes just like that? Two people that are meant for each other... will not easily be torn apart. You said that yourself, right? Yes. But if it's something that's bad for us... we have to get rid of it. Right? You... Don't talk to me like I'm a drug addict, okay? I've thought about this for a long time. I've known Azad for years, not just a week or two. I'm sorry. I'm the one you've known for only a week or two. Congratulations. And goodbye. Yes. Ready? You! Don't go! You promised you'd give me a second chance, right? You... I'm not asking for a second chance. I'm asking for one chance. Forget everything. We'll go back to KL and get married. That's what you want, right? I will not force you. But if you feel what I am feeling now... Please... Dian... don't go. So, in the end, two years later, who did I choose? You... I love you. I love you too. Congrats! You finally got married! Wow, your fiancé is so handsome! Did you really meet him in Istanbul? Hey, Lady Gagak, let's go to Istanbul to look for guys. I'm so jealous. My useless boyfriend is never going to propose! I want to get married too!
