- [Announcer] "The Crucible". (frog chirping) (soft drumming music) (singing in a foreign language) (woman laughing) (speaking a foreign language) (lively drumming music) (women screeching) - Betty! (women screaming) Betty, Betty, Betty. (Betty screaming) Betty, daughter! Oh my child, my child! (rooster crowing) Betty child, dear child. (rooster crowing) Will you wake up? Will you open up your eyes, Betty little one? - My Betty not gonna die. - Out of my sight! - My Betty. - Out of my sight! - Is she gone to fly again? I hear she flies. (soft knocking) They say she flies. - There is a hard sickness here, Giles Corey, please to keep the quiet. - I've not said a word no one hear could testify I've said a word. - Man, be quiet now. - Marshall Herrick, you'll not be telling me what to do. (Tituba knocking) - Uncle, Susanna Walcott's here from Dr. Griggs. - [Samuel] What does the doctor say child? - He bid me come and tell you, your Reverend sir, that he cannot discover no medicine for it in his books, that you might look to some unnatural things for the cause. - No, no, there be no unnatural cause here. Go directly home and speak nothing of unnatural causes. - Aye sir, I pray for her. - Uncle, the rumor of witchcraft is all about. I think you'd best go down and deny it yourself. The parlor's packed with people, sir. I'll sit with her. - And what am I to say to them? That my daughter and my niece I discovered dancing like heathen in the forest? - Let you tell them I confessed it and I'll be whipped if I must be, but they're speaking witchcraft, and Betty's not witched, it was sport, Uncle. - You call this sport? I heard Tituba screeching. I saw her swaying like a dumb beast over the fire. If you traffic with spirits of the forest, I must know it now, for surely my enemies will and they will ruin me with it. - But we never conjured spirits. There is nothing, I swear it, Uncle. - Abigail, is there any other cause than you've told me for your being discharged from Goody Proctor's house? It has troubled me you are now seven month out of their house, and all this time, no other family has ever called for your service. - I will not black my face for any of them. Do you begrudge my bed, Uncle? - No, no, no. - My name is good enough and I shall not have it said my name is soiled. Goody Proctor is a gossiping liar. - Mr. Putnam? (people chattering) - [Man] What think you, Mr. Putnam? - It is a providence the thing is out now. It is a proveidence. (men chattering) (woman knocking) - No, no, I cannot have anyone here. Oh, Goody Putnam, come in. - It is a marvel, it is surely a stroke of hell upon you. - Oh, no, Goody Putnam, it is not. - How high did she fly, how high? - No, no, she never flew, Goody Putnam. - In sure she did. Mr. Collins saw her going over Ingersoll's barn and come down light as a bird he says. - Now, look you, Goody Putnam, she never flew. Oh! Good morning, Mr. Putnam. - Why, her eyes is closed. Look you, Ann. - Oh and that's strange. Our Ruth's is open. - Your Ruth is sick? - The devil's touch is heavier than sick. She never waked this morning but her eyes opened. She walks and hears not, sees not, and cannot eat. Her soul is taken surely. - Gods have mercy. - They say you've sent for Reverend Hale of Beverly. - A precaution only. He's very experienced in all demonic arts. - He is indeed and found a witch in Beverly last year. - And lets you remember that. - Thomas, Thomas, I pray you leap not to witchcraft. They will howl me out of Salem for such corruption in my house. - Ann, tell Mr. Parris what you've done. - Reverend Parris, I have laid seven babies unbaptized in the earth. And believe me, sir, you never saw more hearty babies born, yet each would whither in my very hands the very night of its birth. And now my Ruth, my only, shrivels as if a sucking mouth were pulling on her life, too. So I thought to send her to your Tituba. - To Tituba? What may Tituba-- - Tituba knows how to speak to the dead. - Goody Ann, it is a formidable sin to conjure up the dead. - I take it upon my soul. - Oh. - But who else may surely tell us what person murdered my babies? - Woman! So you were conjuring spirits last night? - O,h not I, sir. Tituba and Ruth. - I am undone. - You are not undone. But you take hold here. Wait for no one to charge you but declare it yourself. You have discovered witchcraft. - [Ann] Aye. - Abigail. Oh, your pardons. Only thought to see how Betty is. - Why aren't you home? Who's with Ruth? - The grandma come. She improved a little I think. She give a powerful sneeze before. - (gasps) There's a sign of life. - Uncle, you've prayed since midnight. Why do you not go down-- - Now look you, sir. If you strike out against the devil, the village will bless you for it. Come down, talk to them, pray with them. - I'll lead them in a prayer but let you say nothing of witchcraft yet. I'll not discuss it. The cause is yet unknown. If she start for the window, cry for me at once. - I will, Uncle. How is Ruth sick? - It's weirdish. I know not. She seems to walk like a dead one since last night. - Betty, now stop this. Betty, sit up now. - Have you tried beating her? I gave Ruth a good one and it waked her for a minute. Here, let me have her. - No, he'll be coming up. Now listen. If they be questioning us, tell 'em we danced. I told them as much already. - And what more? - He saw you naked. - Oh! (both girls laughing) - What do I do? I just come from the farm. The whole country's callin' witchcraft. They'll be calling us witches, Abby. - She means to tell I know it. - But, Abby, we've got to tell. Witchery's a hangin' error. We've got to tell the truth, Abby. You'll only be whipped for-- - Oh, we'll be whipped. - [Mary] I never done nothing, Abby. I only looked. - You're a great one for lookin', aren't you, Mary Warren. What a grand peeping courage. (Betty moaning) Betty, Betty, wake up, dear, it's Abigail. (Betty moaning) - The road past my house is a pilgrimage to Salem all morning (laughing). - Clearly to the source of most abominable disgrace to us. - Very well then. - Hi, John. - I hope you're not decided to go in search of loose spirits, Mr. Parris. I've heard promise of that outside. - Reverend Hale is not coming here to look for devils. - Well, what's he coming for? - [Thomas] There'll be children dying in the village, mister. - I see none dying. This society will not be a bag to swing about your head, Mr. Putnam. Did you call a meeting afore me-- - I am sick of meetings. Cannot the man turn his head without to have a meeting. - He may turn his head but not to hell. - Pray, John, be calm. We are at prayer. ♪ Run thee from feared make a noise ♪ (congregation singing) - I'll beat you Betty. (Betty moaning) My, you seem improving. I talked to your papa. I told him everything so there's nothing for you to-- - [Betty] I want my mama! - [Abby] What ails you Betty? Your mama's dead and buried. - I'll fly to Mama. Let me fly! (woman screams) - I told him everything. He knows now. He knows everything we did. - You drank blood, Abby! You didn't tell him that! - Oh, you never say that again, never. - You did! You did! You drank a charm to kill John Proctor's wife. - Shut it. - You drank a charm to kill-- - Now shut it! (Betty crying) Now look you, all of you! We danced and Tituba conjured Ruth Putnam's dead sisters and that is all. Let either of you breathe a word about the other things and I will come to you in the black of some terrible night and bring a pointy reckoning that will shudder you. - [Mary] Oh! - And you know I can do it. I saw Indians smash my poor parents' heads on the pillow next to mine. I have seen some reddish work done at night. I can make you wish you had never seen the sun go down. Now you sit up and stop this. (Betty screaming) - That is Betty. Betty, my darling! - No! - Betty. - Oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh! - Betty. Oh, oh, oh. - Betty, Betty. (Betty grunting) What are you doing to her? - Well, she heard the singing and suddenly she's up and screaming. - Oh, my dear. - The psalm, the psalm. She cannot bear to hear the Lord's name. - No, no God forbid. Mercy, go to the doctor, tell him what's happened here. - [Ann] Mark it for a sign, mark it. - Go to her, Rebecca. We are lost. Suddenly she cannot bear to hear the Lord's name. (Betty panting) - [Rebecca] That's it. - Rebecca. - What have you done? - What do you make of it, Rebecca? - Goody Nurse, would you go to my Ruth and see if you can wake her? - I think she will wake when she's tired of it. A child's spirit is like a child. You cannot catch it by running after it. You must stand still and then for love, it'll soon of itself come back. (people chattering) Pray, calm yourselves. I think we should rely on the doctor now and good prayer. - But, Rebecca, my Ruth's bewildered. She cannot eat. - I think she's not hungered yet. - But the doctor is baffled. - If so, we must go to God for the cause. - Why, you think it's God's work, that you should never lose a child or a grandchild either and I bury all but one? - There are wheels within wheels in this village and fires within fires. When Mr. Hale comes, you will proceed to look for signs of witchcraft here. - You cannot command Mr. Parris. We vote by name in this society and not by acreage. - Never knew you worried so on this society, Mr. Proctor. I do not think I saw you at sabbath meetings since snow flew. - Well, I have trouble enough without I come five mile to hear him preach nothing but hellfire and bloody damnation. - [Thomas] Aye. - And take it to heart, Mr. Parris. There are many others that stay away from church these days because you hardly ever mention God anymore. - Har, that's a drastic charge. - It be somewhat true. There are many who quail to bring their children. - I do not preach for children, Rebecca. It is not the children who unmindful of their obligation toward this ministry. Where is my wood? My contract calls for me to be supplied with all my firewood. - You are allowed six pounds a year to buy your wood, Mr. Parris. - I regard that six pounds as part of my salary. - 60 plus six for-- - The salary is 66 pound, Mr. Proctor. I am not some preaching farmer with a book under his arm. I'm a graduate of Harvard College. - Hey, and well instructed in arithmetic. (all laughing) (loud tapping) - I do not fathom it. Why am I persecuted here? I have often thought the devil be in it somewhere. You people seem not to comprehend a minister is the Lord's man in the parish. - [Men] Aye. - There is either obedience or the church will burn as hell is burning. - [Men] Aye. - And you not speak one moment without we all land in hell again. I'm sick of hell. - It is not for you to say what is good for you to hear. - I may speak my heart I think. - We are not yet Quakers here, Mr. Proctor. And you may tell that to your followers. - My followers? - There's a party (loud thudding) in this church. I'm not blind. There's a faction and a party. - Aye. - [Thomas] Faction and a party. - Against you? - Against him and all authority. - [All] Aye. - Why then I must find it and join it. (men shouting) - He does not mean it. - Confessed it now. - I mean it solemnly, Rebecca. I like not the smell of his authority. - No, John. You must not break charity with your minister. Come now, clasp his hand and make your peace. - [Rev. Hale] Will someone take these? - Reverend Hale, it's good to see you again. (people chattering) My, they're heavy. - Must be, they are weighted with authority and shall need hard study if it comes to tracking down the old boy. - Aye. - [Thomas] Aye. - Good day to you all. (people chattering) - Thank you, sir. - Why, you cannot be Rebecca Nurse. - I am, sir. Do you know me? - It's strange how I knew you. We've all heard your great charities in Beverly. - And do you know this gentleman, Mr. Thomas Putnam and his good wife Ann? - Putnam, I had not expected such distinguished company, sir. - There's a sure sign of witchcraft afloat here, mister. - No! Now, let me instruct you. We cannot look to superstition in this. The devil is precise. The marks of his presence are as definite as stone. And I must tell you all that I shall not proceed unless you are prepared to believe me if I should find no bruise of hell upon her. - It is agreed, sir. - [Men] Aye, agreed. - We will abide by your judgment. - Good then. Now, sir, what were your first warning of this strangeness? - [Samuel] Why, I found her and my niece and some of the other girls dancing in the forest last night. - [Rev. Hale] Dancing? You permit dancing? - [Samuel] Oh, no, no, no, it was secret. - [Ann] Well, I knew of it, sir. You see I saw-- - Be you foolish, Mary Warren? - Oh, I was just going home, Mr. Proctor. - I forbid you leave the house, did I not? Why should I pay you? I'm looking for you more often than my cow. - [Ann] Do not judge me (drowned out by footsteps clomping). Let the Lord judge me. Is it the natural work to lose seven children before they've lived a day? - Seven dead in childbirth? - Aye. - Aye, seven. - [Samuel] She had two. (Abby giggles) - Ah ah. What's this mischief here? - She's gone silly somehow. - [John] The town's mumbling witchcraft. - Oh, posh. We were dancing in the woods last night. My uncle leaped in. She took fright is all. - (chuckles) You're wicked yet, aren't ya? (chuckles) You'll be clapped in the stocks before you're 20. (John grumbles) - Give me a word, John, a soft word. - No, Abby, no, that's done with. - You've come five miles to see a silly girl fly? I know you better. - I come to see what mischief your uncle's brewing now. Put it out of mind, Abby. - John, I'm waitin' for ya every night. - I never give you hope to wait for me. - I have something better than hope I think. - Abby, you will put it out of mind. I'll not be coming for you more. - Oh surely sporting with me. - You know me better. - I know how you clutched my back behind your house and sweated like a stallion whenever I come near. Or did I dream that? I saw your face when she put me out. You loved me then and you do now. - That's a wild thing to say. - A wild thing may say wild things! I have a sense for ye, John. And yours has drawn me to my window. I've seen you looking up burning in your loneliness. Do you tell me you've never looked up at my window? - I may have looked up. - And you must. You're no wintry man. I know you, John, I know you. I cannot sleep for dream and I cannot dream but I wake and walk about the house as though I'd find you coming through the door. - Ah child. - How do you call me child? - Abby. I may think softly of you from time to time. But I'll cut off my hand before I reach for you again. Wipe it out of mind, Abby. We never touched. - But we did. - [John] Aye, but we did not! - Oh, I marvel how such a strong man may let such a sickly wife. - Speak nothing of Elizabeth. - She is a cold, sniveling woman and you bend to her instead I burn you. - You look for a whipping? (crying) I look for John Proctor who took me from my sleep and put knowledge in my heart. And you bid me tear the light out of my eyes? I cannot, I will not. You love me, John Proctor. Whatever sin it is, you love me yet. (Abby crying) John! John! Begging thee. - Here is all the invisible world caught, defined, and calculated. Here are all your familiar spirits, your Incubi and Sucubi, your witches that go by land, by air, and by sea, your wizards of the night and of the day. Have no fear now. We shall find him out if he has come among us. And I mean to crush him utterly if he has shown his face. - Will it hurt the child, sir? - I cannot tell. If she is truly in the devil's grip, we may have to rip and tear to get her free. - I think I'll go then. I am too old for this. I go to God for you, sir. - I hope you do not mean we go to Satan here, Rebecca. - I wish I knew. (people chattering) - Will you come, Giles? - No, no, John, I think not. I have some few queer questions of my own to ask this fella. - I've heard you be a sensible man, Mr. Hale. I hope you leave some of it in Salem. - Will you go look at my daughter now, sir? - Mr. Hale, what signifies the reading of strange books? - Who does this? - My wife, Martha. Last night, mark this, I tried and tried to say my prayers and I could not. And then she close her book, leave the house, and then suddenly like this I could pray again. - Ha, stoppage of prayer. - Stoppage of prayer? (people chattering) - Strange. I must speak further on that with you. - Oh, well, I'm not saying she's touched the devil, now mind you. But I would admire to know what books she reads and why she hides them from me. She'll not answer me you see. - Aye, we'll discuss it. Mr. Putnam, stand close in case she flies. Now, Betty dear, will you sit up? Can you hear me? Does someone afflict you, child? It need not be a woman mind you or a man. Perhaps some bird invisible to others comes to you, perhaps a pig, a mouse, or any beast at all. Is there some figure bids you fly? (speaking a foreign language) (Betty moans) Abigail, what sort of dancing were you doing with her in the forest? - Why, common dancing is all. - I think I ought to say I saw a kettle in the grass where they were dancing. - [Abby] That was only soup. - You did not notice, did you, Mr. Parris, any living thing in the kettle, a mouse perhaps, a spider, a frog? - I do believe there were some movement in the soup. - That jumped in. We never put it in. - What jumped in? - Why, a very little frog jumped in. (people gasping) - A frog, Abby! - Abigail, it may be your cousin is dying. Did you call the devil last night? - I never called him. Tituba, Tituba! - She called a devil? - I should like to speak with Tituba. - Betty! - Goody, will you - Betty! - bring her up? - Fine. - Wake up, Betty. - Cannot evade me, Abigail. Did your cousin drink any of the brew in that kettle? - She never drank it. - [Rev. Hale] Did you drink it? - No, sir. - Did Tituba ask you to drink it? - She tried but I refused. - Why are you concealing? - No! - Have you sold - No! - yourself to Lucifer? - I never sold myself! She made me do it! She made Betty do it! - Abby! - She makes me drink blood. - No! - My baby's blood? - No, no, chicken blood. I give she chicken blood. - [Rev. Hale] Woman, have you enlisted these children for the devil? - I have not truck with the devil, sir. You begged me to make conjure. - You lie! - She beg me to make charms. - She comes to me while I sleep. And sometimes I wake and find myself standing in an open doorway and not a stitch on my body. (man gasping) - Mr. Reverend, I not-- - Tituba, I want you to wake this child. - No whoa, I have no power on this child, sir. - You most certainly do. - No! - You will confess yourself of I will take you out and whip you till you're dead, Tituba. - No! - This woman must be hanged. She must be taken and hanged. - No! No, don't hang Tituba! (Tituba crying) I tell him I don't desire to work for him, sir. - And you saw him? Tituba, look into my eyes. (Tituba sobbing) Tituba, look into my eyes. Look at my eyes. If you would be a good Christian woman, would you not, Tituba? - Aye, sir, a good Christian woman. - And you love God, Tituba? - I love God with all my being. - Now in God's holy name. - Praise his name. - Bless him. Bless him! - And to his glory. - Eternal glory. - Glory be to God. - Bless God. - Glory be to God. - [Tituba And Samuel] Bless him. - Open yourself, Tituba! - Oh, bless the Lord! - Praise him. - When the devil comes to you, does he ever come with another person? Perhaps another person, another person in the village? - Oh. - Sarah Good? Did you ever see Sarah Good with him, her husband? - Was it a man or woman come with him? - (shouting and panting) Man or woman. It was woman. - [Samuel] What woman? You said a woman, what woman? - It was black dark. - You are God's instruments put in our hands to discover the devil's agents among us. Tituba, you are selected, you are chosen (Tituba shouting) to help us cleanse this village so speak utterly. (Tituba wailing) Turn your back on him and face God, face God, Tituba. God will protect you. - God, protect Tituba! - God will protect Titbuba. - God, protect. Now, who came to you with the devil. Two, three, four, how many? (Tituba crying) - There was four. - [Rev. Hale] Who, who? - There was four. - Their names, the names. - How many times he bid me kill you, Mr. Parris! - Oh! - [Thomas] Mr. Parris. - Kill me? - Aye. He bid me rise of my bed and cut your throat! But I tell him no, I don't want to kill that man. But he say, "You work for me, Tituba. "I make you free. "I give you pretty dress to wear. "I put you high in the air. "And you will gone fly back to Barbadoes." And I say, "You lie, devil, you lie!" Then he come to me one stormy night and he say, "Look, I have white people "belong to me." - Ah. - Eh. - And I look and there was Sarah Good. - Sarah Good? - Another witch. - Aye, and Goody Osburn. - Goody Osburn. - Who else? - Goody Osburn were a midwife to me three times. My babies always shriveled in her hands. - Take courage. You must give us all their names. How can you bear to see this child suffering? - I cannot. - Look at her, Tituba, - I can't. No. - Look at her. Look at her god-given innocence. - No! - Her soul is so tender. We must protect her, Tituba. The devil is out - No! - and preying on her like a beast upon the flesh of the pure lamb. (people chattering) God will bless you for your help! - I want to open myself! - Abigail! - I want the light of God. I want the sweet love of Jesus. - Abby. - I danced for the devil. (slow drumming music) I saw him. I wrote in his book. (all gasping) I go back to Jesus. I kiss his hand. - Sweet Jesus. - I saw Sarah Good with the devil. - Sarah Good! - Dear Lord. - I saw Goody Osburn with the devil. - Goody Osburn. - Oh the lady. - I saw Bridget Bishop with the devil. - Bridget Bishop. - I saw George Jacobs with the devil. - Lord, she speaks. - I saw Goody Howe with the devil. (all shouting) - Call the marshal. Let the marshal bring irons. (all shouting) (girls screaming) - [Abby] Walk with the devil. (people shouting) (gavel thudding) - Your worships, I am falsely accused of witchcraft. - Ruth Putnam accuseth you. There she is. - If you can prove that I am guilty, I will lie under it. (people shouting) - Quiet, order. - Gentlemen, this is a sharp time now, a precise time. We live no longer in the dusky afternoon when evil mixed itself with good and befuddled the world. Now by the grace of God the shining sun is up. And them that fear not light will surely praise it. I hope you will be one of those. George Jacobs, have you made no contract with the devil? - No, I never saw the devil in my life. Burn me or hang me, I will stand in the truth of Christ. (people shouting) ♪ Praise God ♪ ♪ The rain is over mmm hmm ♪ ♪ The sun ♪ ♪ Appearing near ♪ ♪ And the sound of the singing ♪ ♪ Of birds is heard ♪ ♪ And the voice ♪ ♪ Of a turtle ♪ ♪ Is burning loud ♪ ♪ Hold him ♪ - Ah, the boys asleep. - They will be soon. - Ah, this farm (crickets chirping) is a con on us. And you go foot by foot dropping seeds into it. - It must be. - You oughta bring some flowers in the house. - Oh, I forgot. I will tomorrow. - It's winter in here yet. On Sunday, let you come with me and we'll walk the farm together. I never see such a load of flowers on the Earth. Lilacs have a purple smell. Lilac is the smell of nightfall, I think. Yeah. Massachusetts is a beauty in the spring. - Aye, it is. It's a rabbit. She walked into the house this afternoon. I found her sitting in the corner like she come to visit. - Well, that's a good sign walking in. - Pray God. It hurt my heart to strip her, poor rabbit. - It's well seasoned. - I took great care. She's tender? - Aye. - If the crop's good, I'll buy Giles Corey's heifer. How would that please you? - Aye, it would. - I mean to please you, Elizabeth. - I know it, John. - Cider? - Aye. - I think you are sad again, are you? - You come so late I thought you had gone to Salem this afternoon. - I have no business in Salem. - [Elizabeth] You did speak of going earlier this week. - I thought better of it since. - Mary Warren's there today. - [John] Why'd you let her? - I couldn't stop her. She frightened all my strength away. - (chuckles) How may such a mouse frighten you, Elizabeth? - It is a mouse no more. When I forbid her go she raised up her chin to me like the daughter of a prince and she says, "But I must go to Salem, Goody Proctor. "I am an official of the court." (John chuckling) "There be 14 people in the jail there now," she says. "And they'll be tried and the court have power "to hang them, too," she says. - Ah, they never hang. - She spoke of Abigail. I did think she were a saint to hear her. I think you must go to Salem, John. I think so. You must tell them it is a fraud. - Aye, it 'tis, it 'tis, surely. - She said it had not to do with witchcraft, did she not? - [John] Aye, she did, she did. - I think you must go to Salem now, John. Let you go tonight. - I will think on it. - You cannot keep it, John. - I know I cannot keep it. I say I will think on it. - Good then. Let you think on it. - I'm only wondering how I may prove what she told me, Elizabeth. She told it to me in a room alone. I have no proof for you. - [Elizabeth] You were alone with her? - For a moment alone, aye. - Why then, it was not as you told me. - [John] For a moment, I say. - Do as you wish then. - Woman. I'll not have your suspicion anymore. - [Elizabeth] Let you not earn it then. - [John] You doubt me yet? - I see what I see, John. - No more. I should have roared you down when first you told me your suspicion. But I wilted. Like a Christian I confessed (chuckles). Confessed, some dream I had. Musta mistaken you for God that day, but you're not. You are not and let you remember it. I have forgot Abigail. - And I-- - Oh, spare me. You forget nothing and forgive nothing. Learn charity, woman. I have gone tiptoe in this house all seven months since she has gone. I cannot speak that I am doubted. Every moment judged for lies. - I do not judge you. - It's like coming to a court when I come into my own house. - The magistrate sits in your heart that judges you. I never thought you but a good man. Only somewhat bewildered. - (chuckles) Elizabeth, your justice would freeze beer. How do you go to Salem when I forbid it? You mock me? I'll whip you if you leave this house again. - I'm sick. I'm sick, Mr. Proctor, pray hurt me not. My insides are all shuddery. I've been in the proceedings all day, sir. - What of these proceedings here and my wife not wholly well? - I made a gift for you today, Goody Proctor. I had to sit long hours in the chair and pass the time with sewing. - Why, thank you, Mary. It's a fair poppet. - We must all love each other now, Goody Proctor. - Aye. Indeed we must. - [Mary] I'll get up early in the morning and clean the house. I must sleep now. - Mary. Is it true there be 14 people arrested? - No, sir. There be 39 now. (Mary crying) - Why, what ails you, child? - Goody Osburn will hang. - Hang? Hang, you say? - [Mary] Aye. - The Deputy-Governor will permit it? - He sentenced her. He must. But not Sarah Good. Sarah Good confessed, you see. - Confessed to what? - That she sometime made a compact with Lucifer and wrote her name in his black book with her blood and swore to torment Christians till God's thrown down. - Surely you know what a jabberer she is. Did you not tell them that? - Mr. Proctor, in open court she nearly choked us all to death. - How choked you? - She sent a spirit out. - Oh, Mary, surely, surely you can't believe-- - She tried to kill me many times, Goody Proctor. - Why, I never heard you mention it before. - Well, I never knew it before. I never knew anything before. When she come into the court I say to myself, I must not accuse this woman, because she sleep in ditches, and so very old and poor. But then she sit there, denying and denying, and I feel a misty coldness climbin' up my back, and the skin on my skull begin to creep, and I feel a clamp around my neck and I cannot breathe air. And then I hear a voice, a screamin' voice, and it were my voice! And all at once I remember everything she done to me! - Why, what did she do to you? - So many time, Mr. Proctor, she come to this very door beggin' bread and a cup of cider. And mark this, whenever I turned her away empty, she mumbled. And I thought my guts would burst for two days afterward. Do you remember it? - Why, I do, I think, but I... - So I told that to Judge Hathorne. And he asks her so. "Goody Osburn," says he, "what curse do you mumble that this girl must fall sick "after turning you away?" And she replies, "Why, Your Excellence, "no curse at all. "I only say my commandments. "I hope I may say my commandments," says she. - And that was an upright answer? - Aye, but then Judge Hathorne say, "Recite for us your commandments!" And of all the 10 she could not say a single one and they had her in a flat lie! - But the proof, the proof? - I told you the proof, it's hard proof, hard as rock the judges said. - You will not go to that court again, Mary Warren. - I must tell you, sir, I'll be gone every day now. (John groans) I'm amazed you do not see what weighty work we do. (whip snapping) The devil's loose in Salem, Mr. Proctor. We must discover where he's hiding! I saved her life today! - I am accused? - Somewhat mentioned. But I said I never see no sign that you sent your spirit out to hurt no one, and seeing as I live so closely with you, they dismissed it. - Who accused me? - I'm bound by law. I cannot tell it. I only hope you'll not be so sarcastical no more. - [John] Go to bed. - [Mary] I'll not be ordered to bed no more, Mr. Proctor! - Do you wish to sit up? Then sit up. - I wish to go to bed! - Good night, then! - Good night. - She wants me dead. I knew all week it would come to this. - [John] They dismissed it. You heard her say. - And what of tomorrow? She'll cry me out until they take me. She wants me dead, John, you know it. Will you favor me with this? Go to Abigail. - But what have I to say to Abigail? - John, there is a promise made in any bed. - What promise? - Spoke or silent, a promise is surely made. There be a thousand names, why does she cry out mine? I am no Goody Good that sleeps in ditches, nor Osburn drunk, half-witted. She thinks to kill me and then to take my place. - She cannot think it. - Then go to her. Tell her she's a harlot. Whatever promise she senses break it, John, break it. - How do you charge me with such a promise? The promise that a stallion gives a mare I gave that girl. - Then why do you anger with me when I bid you break it? - Because it stinks deceit and I am honest. I will plead no more. I see now your spirit twists around the single error of my life and I will never tear it free. - You will tear it free when you come to know that I am your only wife or no wife at all! She has an arrow in you yet, John Proctor, and you know it well! - [Rev. Hale] Good evening. - Mr. Hale. - I hope I do not startle you. - No, no, no, no, it's just that I heard no horse. We are not used to visitors after dark, but you are welcome here, sir. - You are Goodwife Proctor. - Aye, Elizabeth. Will you sit you down, sir? - I will. Let you sit, Goodwife Proctor. Sit you down, sir. I will not keep you long, but I have some business with you. - Business of the court? - No. No, I come of my own. I know not if you are aware, but your wife's name is mentioned in the court. - We know it, sir. - I am a stranger here, as you know. And in my ignorance, I find it hard to draw a clear opinion of them that come accused before the court. So this afternoon, and now tonight, I go from house to house. I come now from Rebecca Nurse's house. - Rebecca's charged? - She is somewhat mentioned. - You would never believe I hope that Rebecca trafficked with the devil. - Woman, it is possible. - Surely you cannot think so. - This is a strange time, mister. No man may longer doubt the powers of the dark are gathered in monstrous attack upon this village. There is too much evidence now to deny it. The devil is alive in Salem and we dare not quail to follow wherever the accusing finger points. I thought, sir, to put some questions as to the Christian character of this house. In the book of record that Mr. Parris keeps, I note that you have three children. - Aye, boys. - How comes it that only two are baptized? - I like it not that Mr. Parris should lay his hand upon my baby. I see no light of God in that man. - But that is not for you to decide. The man is ordained, therefore the light of God is in him. There is a softness in your record, sir, a softness. - I nailed the roof on the church. I hung the door. - Ah, did you? That's a good sign. Do you know your commandments, Elizabeth? - I surely do, Mr. Hale. I'm a covenanted Christian woman. - And you, mister? - Yes, sir, I should think I do. - Let you repeat them, if you will. - The Commandments? - [Rev. Hale] Aye. - Thou shalt not kill. - [Rev. Hale] Aye. - Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods, nor make unto thee any graven image. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Uh, thou shalt remember the Sabbath Day and keep it holy. Thou shalt honor thy father and thy mother. Thou shalt not bear false witness. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image. - You have said that twice, sir. - Ah. - Adultery, John. - Aye. (chuckles) You see, sir, between the two of us we do know them all. (laughing) I think it be a small fault. - Theology, sir, is a fortress. No crack in a fortress may be accounted small. - There is no love for Satan in this house, mister. - I pray it. I pray it dearly. Well, then. I bid you good night. - I think you must tell him, John. - What's that? - Will you tell him? - I have no witness and cannot prove it except my word be taken, but I know that the children's sickness has naught to do with witchcraft. - Naught to do? - Mr. Parris discovered them sporting in the woods. They became startled and took sick. - Who told you this? - Abigail Williams. - Mister, I have myself examined Tituba, Sarah Good, and numerous others that have confessed to dealing with the devil. They have confessed it. - And why not, when they must hang for denyin' it? Have you never thought of that? - I have. I have indeed. And you, would you testify to this in court? - I hadn't reckoned with going into court, but if I must I will. - But to let you open with me now for I have a rumor that troubles me. It's said you hold no belief there may even be witches in the world. Is that true, sir? - I have wondered if there be witches although I cannot believe they come among us now. - You do not believe? - I have no knowledge of it. The Bible speaks of witches, I will not deny it. - [Rev. Hale] And you, woman? - I cannot believe it. - [Rev. Hale] You cannot! - Elizabeth, you bewilder him. - I cannot think the devil may own a woman's soul, and she keep an upright way, as I do. I am a good woman, I know it. - Woman, you do believe there are witches in the world. - If you think that I am one, then I say there are none. - You surely do not fly against the Gospel, the Gospel-- - Question Abigail Williams about the Gospel not myself. - She do not mean to doubt the Gospel, Mr. Hale, you cannot think it. This is a Christian house, sir, a Christian house. - God keep you both. Let the third child be quickly baptized and get you without fail each Sunday into Sabbath prayer. And keep a solemn, quiet way among you. I think you are-- - John! John! - [John] Giles! - [Giles] John Proctor! - [John] What's the matter? - John, they take my wife (cricket chirping) and his Rebecca. - Rebecca's in the jail! - Now they have gone too far. - Aye, Ezekiel Cheever come and take her in his wagon. Reverend Hale, can you not talk to the Deputy-Governor? My wife is the very brick and mortar of the church, Mr. Hale. - [Rev. Hale] How is Rebecca charged, Mr. Nurse? - For murder, she's charged. - Yeah. - For the marvelous and supernatural murder of Goody Putnam's babies. What am I to do, Mr. Hale? - Believe me, Mr. Nurse, if Rebecca Nurse be tainted, then nothing's left to stop the whole green world from burning. Let you rest upon the justice of the court. The court will send her home, I know it. - How may such a woman murder children? - Man, remember, until an hour before the devil fell, God thought him beautiful in Heaven. - I never said my wife were a witch, Mr. Hale. I only said she were reading books. - Mr. Corey, exactly what complaint were made on your wife? - That bloody mongrel Walcott he charge her. You see, he buy a pig of my wife four or five year ago, and the pig died so he come dancin' in for his money back. So my Martha she says to him, "Walcott, if you haven't wit to feed a pig properly, "you'll not live to own many," she says. So now he claims in court from that day to this he cannot keep a pig alive more than four weeks because my Martha bewitch him with a book! (dog barking) (cricket chirping) - Evening to you, Proctor. - Cheever, good evening. I hope you come not on business of the court. - I do, Proctor, aye. I be clerk of the court now, you know. Evening all. Evening, Mr. Hale. - It is a pity, Ezekiel, that an honest tailor might have gone to Heaven, must burn in hell. You'll burn for this, you know. - Ah, you know yourself I must do as I'm told, Giles. And I'd as leave you not be sending me to hell. I likes not the sound of it. I have a warrant for your wife. - You said she were not charged. - I know nothing of it. - Who charged her? - Why, Abigail Williams charge her. - On what proof? - Proctor, I have little time. Will you hand me any poppets your wife may keep here? - Poppets? - I never kept no poppets, not since I were a girl. - Aye. - I spy a poppet, Goody Proctor. - Oh! Why, that's Mary Warren's poppet. - Oh, will you please to hand it to me? - Has the court discovered a text in poppets now? - Woman, will you please to come me? - [John] She will not. Fetch Mary Warren, Elizabeth. - No, no, I'm forbid to leave her from my sight. - Or out of sight and out of mind, mister. Fetch Mar, Elizabeth. - What signifies this poppet, Mr. Cheever? - Why, they say it may... Why, this-- - What's that? - It's a needle! Herrick, Herrick, it's a needle! - [John] What signifies a needle? - I had my doubt, Proctor, I had my doubt. But here is calamity. Can see it true. It is a needle. - Why, what meaning has it? - Well, the girl, the Williams girl, Abigail Williams, sir. She sat to dinner in Reverend Parris' house tonight, and without word nor warnin', she falls to the floor. Like a struck beast, he says, and she screamed a scream that a bull would weep to hear. And he goes to save her, and stuck two inches in the flesh of her belly he draws a needle out. She testify it were your wife's familiar spirit pushed it in. - Why, she done it herself! I hope you'll not take this for proof, mister. - 'Tis hard proof - Here now, Mary Warren. Aye, how came this poppet come into my house? - What poppet's that, sir? - This poppet, this poppet. - I think it's mine, sir. - And how came it into my house? - Why, I made it in the court today and gave it to Goody Proctor tonight. - Now, sir, do you have it? - Mary Warren. A needle have been found inside this poppet. - Why, I meant no harm by it, sir. - You stuck that needle in yourself? - [Mary] I believe I did, sir. - What say you? - Child, may it be, perhaps, that someone conjures you even now to say this? - No, sir. Let you ask Susanna Walcott. She saw me sewin' it in court. Better still, ask Abby. Abby sat beside me while I made it. - Bid him be gone. Surely your mind is settled now. Bid him out, Mr. Hale. - What signifies a needle? - Mary, you charge a cold and cruel murder on Abigail. - [Mary] Murder? - Abigail were stabbed tonight. A needle were found stuck into her belly. - And she charges me? (Mary whimpering) - [Rev. Hale] Aye. - Why, the girl is murder! She must be ripped out of the world! - You've heard that, sir! Ripped out of the world! Herrick, you heard that! - Out with you! - [Ezekiel] Proctor, you dare not touch the warrant! - Damn the Deputy-Governor! Out of my house! - Sir! Proctor, Proctor. - Get you gone with them! You are a broken minister. - Proctor, if she is innocent the court will find her-- - If she is innocent! You never wonder if Abigail is innocent, or Parris? Is the accuser always holy now? Were they born this morning as clean as God's fingers? I'll tell you what's walking Salem, vengeance is walking Salem. We are only what we always were in Salem, but now the little crazy children are jangling the keys of the kingdom, and common vengeance writes the law! I will not give my wife to vengeance! - I'll go, John. - You will not go. - I did not come alone, John. You know you cannot keep her. The law binds me, John. - Will you see her taken? - Proctor, the court is just. - Why don't you sign it? God will not let you wash your hands of this. And the wind, God's icy wind will blow. - John, I think I must go with them. Mary, there is enough bread for the morning. You will bake in the afternoon. When the children wake speak nothing of witchcraft. It will frighten them. - I will bring you home. I will bring you soon. - Oh bring me soon, John! - I will fall like an ocean on that court! Fear nothing, Elizabeth. - No, I will fear nothing. (chains jangling) - Herrick. Herrick, don't chain her. God! Where are you? You do not. I'll not ever take thee well to that. Herrick! I'll pay you for this, I'll surely pay you. - In God's name, man. I cannot help myself. I must chain them all. Let you keep inside the house till I'm gone. - Mr. Proctor. - [John] Get out of my sight. - Charity, Proctor, charity. What I have heard in her favor I will not fear to testify in court. God help me, I cannot judge her guilty or innocent. I know not. Only this consider, the world goes mad, and it profit nothing you should lay the cause to the vengeance of a little girl. - You are a coward! Though you be ordained in God's own tears, you are a coward now. - Proctor, I cannot believe God be provoked so grandly by such a petty cause. Man, we must look to cause proportionate where they're murdered on perhaps and never brought to light. Abomination, some secret blasphemy that stinks to Heaven. Think on cause, man, and let you help me to discover it. And let you counsel among yourselves. Think on your village and what may have drawn from Heaven such thundering wrath upon you all. I shall pray God, open up our eyes. - Tell me, John, are we lost? - Go home, Giles. We'll speak on it tomorrow. - Let you be thinkin' on it then. We'll come early, eh, John? - Aye, go home now. - Good night, then. - Now, Martha Corey, there is abundant evidence in our hands to show that you have given yourself to the reading of fortunes. Do you deny it? - I am innocent to a witch. I know not what a witch is. - How do you know then that you are not a witch? - If I were I would know it. - Why do you hurt these children? - I do not hurt them. I scorn it! - I have evidence for the court! (people shouting) I bring evidence. - You will keep your seats! - Thomas Putnam is reachin' out for land! (people shouting) - How do you dare to come roarin' into this court. Are you gone daft, Corey? - You're not a Boston judge yet, Hathorne. You'll not be calling me daft! - [Gov. Danforth] Marshal, remove this man. - Your Excellency, they are tellin' lies, lies. (people shouting) Let me be. - Excellency, he claims hard evidence for his wife's defense. I think in all justice we must hear what he has. - Then let him submit his evidence in proper affidavit. - We are desperate, sir. We come here three days now and cannot be heard. - [Judge Hathorne] Who is this man? - Francis Nurse, Your Excellency. - His wife's Rebecca that were condemned this morning. - Indeed. I am amazed to find you in such uproar. I have only good report for your character, Mr. Nurse. - Excellency, we have proof for your eyes. God forbid you shut them to it. The girls, sir, the girls are frauds, sir. (people shouting) - No, this is contempt, sir, contempt! - Peace, Judge Hathorne. Do you know who I am, Mr. Nurse? - I surely do, sir. And I think you must be a wise judge to be what you are. - And do you know that near to 400 are in the jails from Marblehead to Lynn, and upon my signature? - I, I-- - And 72 condemned to hang by that signature? - Excellency, I never thought to say it to such a weighty judge, but you are deceived. (people shouting) - [Man] Away with you. - Come, mister. Come, mister. Mr. Hale. - [Man] Away with ye. - Who is this man? - Giles Corey, sir. - A most contentious man, sir. - I am asked that question and I am old enough to answer that question. I am Corey, sir, Giles Corey. I have 600 acres and timber in addition. And it is my wife that you be condemning. I only said she were readin' books, Your Excellency, and they come to my house and take her away. There's no witch I will blame in her for. I have broken charity with her. (Giles crying) (people shouting) - Mary Warren, what, what are you about here? - [John] She would speak with the Deputy-Governor. - Did you not tell me Mary Warren was sick in bed? - She were, Your Honor. - She's been strivin' with her soul all week, Your Honor. She comes now to tell the truth of this to you. - Who is this? - [John] John Proctor. Elizabeth Proctor is my wife. - This man is mischief, Your Excellency. - I think you must hear the girl, sir. (people shouting) - Peace, peace. Marshal, bring them into the vestry. (people chattering) Now, Mary Warren, what would you tell us? - She never saw no spirits, sir. - Never saw no spirits? - Never. - She has signed a deposition, sir. - No, no, I accept no depositions outside the court. - They have come to overthrow this court-- - I pray you, Mr. Parris. Mr. Proctor, do you know that the entire contention of the State in these trials is that the voice of Heaven is speaking through the children? - I know that, sir. - [Gov. Danforth] And you, Mary Warren, how came you to cry out people for sending their spirits against you? - It were pretense, sir. - I cannot hear you. - "It were pretense." she says. - Oh. And the other girls? Susanna Walcott, and the others? They were also pretending? - Aye, sir. - Indeed. - Surely, you cannot think to let so vile a lie be spread in open court, Your Honor. - Mr. Proctor, I think it is my duty to tell you this. We burn a hot fire here. It melts down all concealment. - I know that, sir. - I take it you have thought to declare this revelation in the open court before the public? - I thought I would, aye, with your permission. - [Gov. Danforth] Now, sir, what is your purpose in so doing? - I would free my wife, sir. - There lurks nowhere in your heart, nor hidden in your spirit, any desire to undermine this court? - Why, no, sir. - I think it be my duty, sir. You'll not deny it, John. When we come to take his wife, he damned the court and ripped your warrant. - [Thomas] Now you have it. - [Gov. Danforth] You did that, Mr. Proctor? - It were a temper, sir, I knew not what I did. - Your Honor, I cannot think you judge the man on such evidence. - I judge nothing. - Marshal, clear the court. All witnesses and prisoners are to be kept in the building. - [Marshal] Court is recessed for one hour. Witnesses and prisoners will remain in the building. Clear the court. (people shouting) - Aye, she's the one. - [Marshal] What's going on back there (drowned out by people shouting). - Mr. Proctor, this morning your wife sent me a claim in which she states that she is pregnant now. - My wife is pregnant? - [Gov. Danforth] There be no sign of it. We have examined her body. - But if she says she is, she must be. That woman will never lie, Mr. Danforth. - She will not? - [John] Never, sir, never. - Mr. Proctor, if I were to tell you now that I will let her be kept yet another month. and if she begin to show her natural signs, you shall have her living yet another year until she is delivered, what say you to that? Come now, you say your only purpose is to save your wife. Good then, she is saved at least a year, and a year is long. What say you, it is done now? Will you drop this charge? - I think I cannot, sir. - Then your purpose is somewhat larger? - [Thomas] He's come to overthrow this court, Your Excellency! - These are my friends. Their wives are also accused. - I judge you not, sir. I am ready to hear your evidence. - Go to the court, John. - Excellency-- - One moment. - Excellency, in God's name, stop here. Send him home and let him come again with a lawyer. - The pure in heart need no lawyers. - Excellency, I have signed 72 death warrants. I am a minister of the Lord and I dare not take a life without there be a proof so immaculate, no slightest qualm of conscience may doubt it. - Mr. Hale, you surely do not doubt my justice. - I have the soul, this morning signed away the soul of Rebecca Nurse, Your Honor. I'll not conceal it. My hand shakes yet as with a wound. I pray you, sir, this argument, let lawyers present to you. - Mr. Hale, for a man of such terrible learning, you are most bewildered. I hope you will forgive me. Now, let you consider, in an ordinary crime, how does one defend the accused? One calls up witnesses to prove his innocence. But witchcraft is ipso facto on its face and by its nature an invisible crime, it is not? Therefore, who may possibly be witness to it? The witch and the victim, none other. No, we cannot hope that the witch will accuse herself, granted? Therefore, we must rely upon her victims. And the children certainly do testify. As for the witches, none will deny that we are most eager for all their confessions. Therefore, what is left for a lawyer to bring out, hmm? I think I've made my point, have I not? - But this child claims the girls are not truthful. And if they are not truthful-- - That is precisely what I am about to consider, sir. What more may you ask of me? Unless you doubt my probity. - I surely do not, sir. That you consider it then. - And let you put your heart to rest. Begin the record, Mr. Cheever. The court is now in session. - [Ezekiel] Aye, sir. - Now, Mr. Proctor, what deposition do you have for us? - Will you read this first, sir? It's a sort of testament. The people signing it declare their good opinion of Rebecca, and my wife, and Martha Corey. These are all landholding farmers, members of the church. - How many names are here? - 91, Your Excellency. - These people must be summoned, Your Excellency. For questioning. - Mr. Danforth, I gave them all my word no harm would come to them for signing this. - This is a clear attack upon the court. - Is every defense an attack upon the court? Can nobody come-- - I think they should be examined, sir. - But these are all covenanted Christians, sir. - Then I'm sure they have nothing to fear. You must understand, sir, that a person is either with this court or he must be counted against it. There be no road between. - Mr. Cheever, have warrants issued for all of these. Arrest for examination. - Right, sir. - Now, Mr. Proctor, what other information do you have for us? - [Giles] John, my deposition. Show him mine. - Aye. And this is Mr. Corey's disposition. - Marshal, if Mr. Putnam is in the building, will you bring him in? - [Marshal] Yes, sir. - What lawyer drew this, Corey? - You know I never hired a lawyer in my life, Hathorne. - It is very well-phrased. My compliments. - Mr. Putnam, I have here an accusation by Mr. Corey against you. He states that you coldly prompted your daughter to cry witchery against George Jacobs who is now in jail. - It is a lie! - Mr. Putnam states that your charge is a lie. What say you to that? (Giles spits) - On Thomas Putnam, that is what I say to that. If Jacobs hangs for a witch, his property is forfeited. That's the law. And there's none but Putnam with coin to buy so great a piece. This man is killing his neighbors for their land! - But proof, sir, proof. - Proof? The proof is there! I have it from an honest man who heard Putnam say it. - And the name of this man? - What name? - The man that give you this information. - Oh, I cannot give you his name. If I give you a name, he lay in jail. I mentioned my wife's name once and I'll burn in hell long enough for that. Ah, no, no, no, I'll stand mute. - In that case, I have no choice but to arrest you in contempt of this court, do you know that? - Your Honor, he has the story in confidence, sir. - The devil lives on such confidences. Without confidences there could be no conspiracy, Your Honor. - Old man, if your informant tells the truth, let him come here openly like a decent man. But if he hide in anonymity, I must know why. - Excellency, we cannot blink it more. There is a prodigious fear of this court in the country. - Then there is a prodigious guilt in the country! There is fear in the country because there is a moving plot to topple Christ in the country! - But it does not follow that everyone accused is part of it. - No uncorrupted man may fear this court, Mr. Hale. None! You are under arrest for contempt of this court. - I'll slit your throat, Putnam! - Giles, no. I'll kill you yet. - Peace, Giles. We'll prove ourselves, now. - Say no more, John. He's only playing with you. He means to hang us all. - This is a court of law, mister. I'll have no effrontery here. - Marshal, will you bring in the children? This child's deposition, Mr. Proctor. - Now, remember what the angel Raphael said to the boy, Tobias. Do you remember it? - Aye, sir. - Do that which is good and no harm will come to thee. - [Mary] Aye, sir. - I would like to question this child. - Mr. Parris, I bid you be silent! Mary Warren, how come you to this turnabout? Has Mr. Proctor threatened you for this deposition? - [Mary] No, sir. - Then you tell me that you sat in my court, callously lying when you knew that people would hang by your evidence? Answer me! - I did, sir. - Do you not know that God damns all liars? Or is it now that you lie? - No, sir I'm with God now. - In either case you have committed perjury and you will go to jail for it. - I cannot lie no more. I'm with God, I'm with God. - Ruth Putnam is not in the court, Your Honor, nor the rest of the children. - These will be sufficient. Sit you down, children. Your friend Mary Warren has given us a deposition in which she swears that she never saw familiar spirits, apparitions, nor any manifest of the devil. She claims as well, that none of you have seen these things either. Now, it may well be that Mary Warren has been conquered by Satan who sends her here to distract our sacred purpose. If so, her neck will break for it. But likewise, children, the law and Bible damn all bearers of false witness. So if she speak true, I bid you now drop your guile and confess your pretense, for a quick confession will go easier with you. Abigail Williams, rise. Is there any truth in this? - [Abby] No, sir. - Children, will either of you change your positions now, or do you force me to hard questioning? - I have naught to change, sir. She lies. - You would still go on with this? - [Mary] Aye, sir. - A poppet were discovered in Mr. Proctor's house, stabbed by a needle. Mary Warren claims that you saw her make it, and witnessed how she herself stuck her needle into it for safe-keeping. What say you to that? - It is a lie. - While you worked in that house, did you ever see poppets there? - Goody Proctor always kept poppets. - Your Honor, my wife never kept poppets. Mary Warren swears she never saw no poppets in my house or anyone else. - Why could not there have been poppets hid where no one ever saw them? - There might also be a dragon with five legs in my house but no one has ever seen it. - Your Honor, we are here precisely to discover what no one has ever seen. - You are charging Abigail Williams with a marvelous cool plot to murder, do you understand that? - I do. I believe she means to murder. - [Gov. Danforth] This child would murder your wife? - It is not a child. Now hear me, Your Honor. In the sight of the congregation, she were twice this year put out of this meetin' house for laughter during prayer. - Laughter during prayer! - She were under Tituba's power at that time, Your Honor. - Mary, now tell the Governor how you danced in the woods. - I was the judge of the Salem. This man is blackening my name. - In a moment, sir! What is this dancing? - Uh, Mr. Proctor. - Abigail leads the girls to the woods, Your Honor, and they have danced there naked. - Your Honor. - Mr. Parris himself discovered them in the dead of night! There's the child she is! - Mr. Parris. - I can only say, Your Honor, I never found any of them naked, and this man is. - When I first arrived from Beverly, Mr. Parris told me that, Excellency. - Do you deny it, Mr. Parris? - I do not, sir, but I never saw any of them naked. - But she have danced? - Aye, sir. - Excellency, will you permit me? - Pray, proceed. - You say you never saw no spirits, Mary. - [Mary] No, sir. - Yet, when people accused of witchery confronted you in court, you would faint, saying their spirits came out of their bodies and choked you. - That were pretense, sir. - They are all marvelous pretenders. - Then can she pretend to faint now? - Now? - Why not? There be no spirits attacking her now for none in this room is accused of witchcraft. So let her turn herself cold now. Let her pretend to be attacked now. Faint. - Faint? - Aye, faint! - I, cannot faint now, sir. - Can you not pretend it? - I, I... (Mary panting) I, I have no sense of it now, sir. I cannot do it. - Then you will confess it were attacking spirits made you faint! - No, sir! - This is a trick, Your Honor, to blind the court. - It's not a trick! I, I used to faint because I thought I saw spirits. - Thought you saw them! - I heard the other girls screaming, and you, your Honor, seemed to believe them and I, it were only sport in the beginning, sir, but then the whole world cried spirits and I... I promise you, Mr. Danforth, I only thought I saw them but I did not. - [Samuel] Surely your Excellency is not taken by this simple lie. - Abigail Williams, I bid you now search your heart, and tell me this and beware of it, child, to God every soul is precious and his vengeance is terrible on them that take life without cause. Is it possible, child, that the spirits you have seen are illusions only, some deception that may cross your mind when-- - I have been hurt, Mr. Danforth. I've seen my blood runnin' out. I've been near to murdered every day because I done my duty pointing out the devil's people. And this is my reward, to be mistrusted, denied, and questioned like-- - Child, I do not mistrust you. - Let you beware Mr. Danforth! Think you to be so mighty that the power of hell may not turn your wits? Beware of it! Ah. (light drumming music) - What is it, child? - I know not. A wind, a cold wind has come. - [Mary] Abby! - Your Honor, I freeze! - Ah! - They're pretending! - She is cold, Your Honor! - Mary, you send down this shadow on me? - Lord save me! - [Girls] I freeze, I freeze. - There's a wind, a wind! - Abby, don't do this! - Ah! - Do you witch her, Mary Warren? I say to you, do you send your spirit out! (Mary screaming) - Oh Abby! - Oh, Heavenly Father, take away this shadow! - How do you call Heaven? Whore! - What are you about, man? (John shouting) (Abby screaming) - Man, what are you-- - She's a whore. - Mr. Danforth, he's lying! - You charge... - Mark her, now she will suck a scream to stab me with. - You will prove this! This will not pass! - I have known her, sir. - Oh, John! - I have known her. - You, you are a lecher? In what time, in what place? - In the proper place where my beasts are bedded on the last night of my joy, some eight months past. Oh, a man may think that God sleeps, but God sees everything. I know that now. I beg you, sir, I beg you. See her what she is. My wife, sir, my dear good wife took this girl soon after, and put her out on the highroad. Excellency, forgive me. But she thinks to dance with me on my wife's grave! And well she might. For I did think softly of her. I lusted, God help me. And there is a promise in such sweat. But it is a whore's vengeance, and you must know it. I put myself entirely in your hands. Surely you see it now. - You deny every scrap and tittle of this? - If I must answer that, I will leave and I will not come back again. - My wife is innocent except she know a whore when she seen one. - What look do you give me? I'll not have such look! - You will remain where you are! Mr. Parris, bring Goodwife Proctor out. - Your Excellency-- - Bring her out! And tell her not one word of what's been spoken here. And let you knock before you enter. Now we shall touch the bottom of this swamp. Your wife, you say, is an honest woman? - (sighs) There be them that cannot sing and them that cannot weep. My wife, sir, cannot lie. - And when she put this girl out of your house, she put her out for a harlot. - Aye. - If she tell me it were for harlotry, child, may God spread his mercy on you. (light knocking) Hold! You will both face the court. Turn your back. Turn your back! Do likewise. Now let neither of you turn to face Goody Proctor. And no one in this room is to speak one word nor raise a gesture aye or nay. Enter. Come here, woman. Look at me only, into my eyes only, not at your husband. - Good sir. - [Gov. Danforth] We are given to understand that at one time you dismissed your servant, Abigail Williams. - That is true, sir. - For what reason did you dismiss her? Look at me only, in my eyes only, not at your husband. The answer is in your memory. You need no help to give it to me. Why did you dismiss Abigail Williams? - She dissatisfied me and my husband. - In what way dissatisfied you? - She were... - Woman, look at me! Were she slovenly? Lazy? What disturbance did she cause? - Your Honor, you see, sir, I were a long time sick after my last baby and I, I thought I saw my husband somewhat turning from me. And this girl-- - Look at me! - Aye. Abigail Williams-- - What of Abigail Williams? - I came to think he somewhat fancied her. And so one night I lost my wits, I think, and put her out on the highroad. - Your husband, did he indeed turn from you? - He... My husband, is a goodly man, sir. - [Gov. Danforth] Then he did not turn from you. - He-- - Look at me! To your own knowledge, has John Proctor ever committed the crime of lechery? Answer my question! Is your husband a lecher? - No, sir. - Remove her, marshal. - Elizabeth, tell the truth! - She has spoken, remove her. - But, I have confessed it! - Oh, God! - She only thought to save my name! - It is a natural lie to tell, Your Honor. I may shut my conscience to it no more. Private vengeance is working through this testimony. - She spoke nothing of lechery! And this man is lying. - I believe him! This girl has always struck me false! (Abby screaming) - No, you will not! Begone, begone, I say! - What is it, child? What's there? - Oh! (light drumming music) - [Gov. Danforth] Girls, why do you-- - It's on the beam, behind the rafter! (girls crying) - Where! - Why do you come, yellow bird? - Where is a bird? I see no bird! - My face, my face. - Mr. Hale. - Be quiet! - There's nothing! - Be quiet! - But God made my face. You cannot want to tear my face. Envy is a deadly sin, Mary. - [Mary] Abby! - Mary, this is a black art to change your shape. No, no, I cannot stop my mouth. It is God's work I do. - Abby, I'm here! - They're pretending, Mr. Danforth! - Oh, Mary, please don't come down! (girls screaming) - Her claws! She's stretching her claws! - It's lies, it's lies! (girls screaming) - Mary, Mary, please don't hurt me! - [Mary] I'm not hurting her! - Why does she see this vision? - She sees nothing! - [Girls] She sees nothing! - Abby, you mustn't! - [Girls] Abby, you mustn't! - I'm here, I'm here! - [Girls] I'm here, I'm here! - Why can they only repeat you? - [Mary] They're sporting. - [Girls] They're sporting. - Abby, stop it! - [Girls] Abby, stop it! - Stop it! - [Girls] Stop it! - Stop it! - [Girls] Stop it! - Oh (crying)! - [Girls] Oh! - A little while ago you were afflicted. Now it seems you afflict others. Where do you find this power? - I have no power. - [Girls] I have no power. - They're gulling you, mister! - Why did you turn about this past two weeks? You have seen the devil, have you not? - You cannot believe them! - I-- - Mary, God damns all liars! - You will confess yourself or you will hang! - God damns liars, Mary. - Do you know who I am? I say you will hang if you do not open with me. - Remember the angel. Do that which is good and-- - The wings! Her wings are spreading! Mary, don't! - I see nothing, Your Honor. - No, oh! - You will confess this power? Speak! - She's going to come down! (girls shouting) She's walking the beam! - Will you speak? - [Mary] I cannot. - [Girls] I cannot! Look out, she's coming down! (girls screaming) - [John] Tell them, Mary! - Don't touch me! - [John] Mary! - Don't touch me! You are the devil's man! - [Thomas] Praise God! - [Girls] Praise God! - [John] Mary. - No, I'll not hang with you! I love God, I love God. - Did he bid you do the devil's work? - He come at me by night and every day to sign, to sign. - Sign what, the devil's book? He come with a book? - My name, he wants my name. "I'll murder you," he says, "if my wife hangs! "We must go and overthrow the court," he says! - Mr. Hale! - He wake me every night. His eyes were like coals and his fingers claw my neck, and I sign, I sign. - Excellency, this child has gone wild. - [John] Mary, Mary! - No! I love God. I go your way no more. I love God, I bless God. Abby, Abby, Abby, I'll never hurt you no more! - Shh, shh. - (crying) Oh! - What are you? You are combined with the anti-Christ, are you not? - Excellency! - I'll hear no more from you, Mr. Hale! Do you confess yourself befouled with hell, or do you keep that black allegiance yet? What say you? - (chuckles) I say, I say God is dead! - Oh Lord. - John! (John laughing) - [Samuel] Hear it! - A fire, a fire is burning. (chuckles) I hear the boot of Lucifer, I see his filthy face. And it is my face and yours, Danforth. For them that quail to bring men out of ignorance as I have quailed and as you quail now when you all know in your black hearts that this be fraud! God damns our kind especially, and we will burn, we will all burn together! (John laughing) - Marshal, take him and Corey with him to the jail! - [Rev. Hale] I denounce these proceedings! - You are pulling Heaven down and raising up a whore! (John laughing) - I denounce these proceedings! I quit this court! - Hale, Mr. Hale! (hammer thudding) (door creaking and clanking) - Marshal, Deputy-Governor's arrived. Marshal! (door creaking and clanking) - Morning. Excellency. - [Gov. Danforth] Where is Mr. Parris? - I'll fetch him. - Marshal, when did the Rev. Hale arrive? - [Willard] It were toward midnight, I think, Your Honor. - What is he about here? - Well, he goes among them that will hang, sir. He prays with them. He sits with Goody Nurse now. And Mr. Parris is with him. - Indeed. Marshal, that man have no authority to enter here. Why do you let him in? - Why, Mr. Parris command me, sir. I cannot deny him. - Are you drunk, marshal? - No, sir. It's a bitter night. I have no fire. - Fetch Mr. Parris. - Let you question Hale, Excellency. I should not be surprised hear he have been preachin' in Andover lately. - Speak nothing of Andover. Parris prays with him. That's strange. - Excellency, I wonder if it be wise to let Mr. Parris so continuously with the prisoners. The man has a mad look these days. I met him yesterday, bid him good morning, and he wept and went his way. - Good morning, sir, thank you for coming. - The Rev. Hale have no right to enter here. - Hear me, Excellency, it is a providence. Reverend Hale returns to bring Rebecca Nurse to God. - He bids her confess? - Hear me. She have not given me one single word, Your Honor, since she come here. Now she sits with him, and with her sister and Martha Corey and two or three others, and he pleads with them confess their crimes and save their lives. - Why, this is indeed a providence. And they soften, they soften? - Not yet, not yet. But I thought to summon you, sir, that you, that we might consider whether it be not better... I had thought to put a question, Your Excellency. I hope you will not be angered. - Mr. Parris, be plain. What troubles you? - There is news, sir, the court must reckon with. Abigail, my niece, sir, I believe she's vanished. - Vanished! - [Samuel] With Mercy Lewis. - They are both gone? - They are, sir. - I will send a party for them. Where may they be? - I believe they be aboard a ship, sir. My daughter tells me how she heard them speaking of ships last week, and tonight I discover my, tonight I discover my strongbox is broke into. (Samuel crying) - She have robbed you? - I am penniless. - Mr. Parris, you are a brainless man! - I cannot think they would run off except they fear to keep in Salem anymore. I pray you, Excellency, postpone these hangings for a time. - There will be no postponement! Give me the list. Now, sir, which of these in your opinion may be brought to God? I will myself strive with him till dawn. - Excellency, tonight a dagger. - [Gov. Danforth] What do you say? - When I opened my door to leave my house, a dagger clattered to the ground. (Samuel crying) You cannot hang this sort! There is danger for me! (door clanging) I dare not step outside at night. - Accept my congratulations, Rev. Hale. We are gladdened to see you returned to your good work. - You must pardon them. They will not budge. - You misunderstand, sir. I cannot pardon these when 12 are already hanged for the same crime. It is not just. - [Samuel] Rebecca will not confess. - I must have more time, Excellency. The sun will rise in a few minutes. - Now hear me, and beguile yourselves no more. I will not accept a single plea for pardon or postponement. Postponement now bespeaks a floundering on my part. While I speak God's law, I will not crack his voice with whimpering. Now, draw yourselves up like men and help me as you are bound by Heaven to do. Have you spoken with all of them, Mr. Hale? - All but Proctor. He is in the dungeon. - What is Proctor's way now? - He sits like some great bird. You'd not know he lived except he will take food from time to time. - His wife, his wife must be well on with child now. - [Willard] She is, Your Honor. - What think you, Mr. Parris? Might her presence soften him? - It is possible, sir. He have not laid eyes on her this three month. - Is he yet adamant? Have he struck at you again? - No, he cannot, sir. He's chained to the wall now. - Fetch Goodwife Proctor to me. Then let you bring him up. - Aye, sir. - Excellency, if you postpone a week, and publish to the town that you are striving for their confessions, that speak mercy on your part, not faltering. - Mr. Hale, as God have not empowered me like Joshua to stop this sun from rising, so I cannot withhold from them the perfection of their punishment. - If you think God wills you to raise rebellion, Mr. Danforth, you are mistaken. - You have heard rebellion spoken of in the town? - Excellency, there are orphans wandering from house to house, abandoned cattle bellow on the highroads, the stink of rotting crops hangs everywhere, and no man knows when the harlots' cry will end his life, and you wonder yet if rebellion is spoke? Better you should marvel how they do not burn your province! - You baffle me, sir. Why have you returned here? - Oh, it's all simple. I come here to do the devil's work. I come here to counsel Christians they should belie themselves. There's blood on my head, sir! Can you not see the blood on my head! (door clanking) - Hush. - Take this off. - Yes, sir. - Goody Proctor. I hope you are hearty. - I am yet three months before my time, sir. - Pray, be at your ease. We come not for your life. We... Rev. Hale, will you speak with the woman? - Goody Proctor, your husband is marked to hang this morning. - I have heard it. - You know, do you not, that I have no connection with the court? I come of my own, Goody Proctor. I would save your husband's life, for if he is taken, I count myself his murderer. Do you understand me? - What do you want of me? - Goody Proctor, I have gone this five month like our Lord into the wilderness. I have sought a Christian way, for damnation's doubled on a minister who counsels men to lie. - It is no lie, you cannot speak of lies! - It is a lie! They are innocent! - I'll hear no more of that! - Let you not mistake your duty as I mistook my own. Beware, Goody Proctor, cleave to no faith when faith brings blood. It is mistaken law that leads you to sacrifice. Life, woman, life is God's most precious gift! No principle however glorious may justify the taking of it. I beg you, woman, prevail on your husband to confess. Let him give his lie. Quail not before God's judgment in this. It may well be that God damns a liar less than he that throws his life away for pride. Will you plead with him? I cannot think he will listen to another. - I think that be the devil's argument. - Oh, woman. Before the laws of God, we are as swine. We cannot read his will. - I cannot dispute with you, sir. I lack learning for it. - Goody Proctor, you are not summoned here for disputation. Be there no wifely tenderness within you? He will die with the sunrise. Are you stone? A very ape would weep at such calamity. Have the devil dried up any tear of pity in you? Take her out! It profit nothing she should speak to him. - Let me speak with him, Excellency. - You'll strive with him? - Will you plead for his confession, or will you not? - I promise nothing. Let me speak to him. (door clanking) (chains clanging) - Pray, leave them, Excellency. - You have been notified, have you not, Mr. Proctor. I see light in the sky, mister. Let you counsel with your wife and may God help you turn your back on hell. (door creaking) (door thudding) - [John] The child? - [Elizabeth] It grows. - There be no word of the boys? - They are fine. Rebecca Samuel keeps them. - [John] You have not seen them? - No, I have not. - (chuckles) You are a marvel, Elizabeth. - [Elizabeth] You, you have been tortured? - Aye. They come now for my life. - I know it. - There be a hundred or more confessed they say. - Rebecca? - Not Rebecca. She is one foot in Heaven now. Naught can hurt her more. (John chuckling) - And Giles, huh? - [Elizabeth] Giles is dead. - When did he hang? - He didn't hang. He wouldn't answer aye or nay to his indictment, for if he denied the charge they would surely hang him and auction out his property. So he stand mute, and died Christian under the law and so his sons will get his farm. It is the law. He could not be condemned for a witch without he answer aye or nay to his indictment. - Then how does he die? - They press him. - Press? - They place stones upon his chest until he plead aye or nay. They say he gave them just two words, "More weight," and died. - "More weight." - [Elizabeth] Aye. It were a fearsome man, Giles Corey. (John laughing) - I, I have been thinking, Elizabeth, that I would confess to them. What say you if I give them this? - [Elizabeth] I cannot judge you, John. - What would you have me do? - As you would, I would have it. I want you living, that's sure. (John chuckles) - Giles' wife, have she confessed? - She will not. (John grunts) - Cannot mount the gibbet like a saint, Elizabeth. It is a fraud. I am not that man. My honesty is broke, Elizabeth. I am no good man. Nothing is spoiled by giving them this lie that were not rotten long before. - And yet you have not confessed till now. That speak goodness in you. - Spite only keeps me silent. It is hard to give a lie to dogs. I would have your forgiveness, Elizabeth. What say you? - It come to naught that I should forgive you if you'll not forgive yourself. It is not my soul, John, it is yours. Only be sure of this. Whatever you will do, it is a good man does it. (chains clanking) - John, I have read my heart this three month. I have sins of my own to count. It needs a cold wife to prompt lechery. - No, no, I'll not hear that. - Best you should know me. - Oh, I know you. - [Elizabeth] You take my sins upon yourself. - No, I take my own, I take my own. - John! I counted myself so plain, so poorly made, no honest love could come to me. Suspicion kissed you when I did. I never knew how to say my love. It was a cold house I kept. (door clanging and creaking) - What say you, Proctor? The sun is soon up. - Do as you will. But let no one judge you, for there is no higher judge under Heaven than Proctor is. - I want my life. - You'll confess yourself? - I would have my life. - God be praised! It is a providence! He will confess! Proctor will confess! - Why do you cry it? It is evil, is it not? 'Tis evil. - I cannot judge you, John, I cannot. - Who will judge me? (Elizabeth crying) God in Heaven? What is John Proctor? What is John Proctor? I think it is honest, I think so. I am no saint. Let Rebecca go like a saint! For me it is fraud, and vanity that will not blind God, but keep my children out of the wind. - I cannot be your judge, I cannot. Do as you will, do as you will. - Would you give them such a lie? Say it. Would you give them this? No, you would not. If tongs of fire were singeing you, you would not. It is evil and I do it. (door clanging) - [Rev. Hale] Oh, thanks be to the Lord. - Express it. He has showered us with blessings this day. - Right. - [Samuel] Heaven will protect you. - [Rev. Hale] Fear, Proctor, this is a good thing you do. - Praise to God, man, praise to God! You will be blessed in Heaven for this. Now then, let us have it. Are you ready, Mr. Cheever? - Aye, sir. - Why must it be written? - Why, for the good instruction of the village, mister. This we shall post upon the church door! Where's the marshal? - [Samuel] The marshal, marshal. - [Gov. Danforth] Now, Mr. Proctor. - [Samuel] Hurry. - Will you speak slowly, and directly to the point for Mr. Cheever's sake? Mr. Proctor, have you seen the devil in your life? Come, man, the town waits at the scaffold. I would give out this news. Did you see the devil? - I did. - [Rev. Hale] Praise God! - And when he come to you, what were his demand? Did he bid you to do his work upon the Earth? - He did. - And you bound yourself to his service. Ah, come in, woman, come in. Courage, man, courage. - [Rebecca] Ah, John. You are well then? - Now hear it, Goody Nurse. Say on, Mr. Proctor, did you bind yourself to the devil's service? - Why, John! - I did! - Now, woman, surely you see it profit nothing to keep this conspiracy any further. Will you confess yourself with him? - God send his mercy on you, John. - I say will you confess yourself, Goody Nurse? - I cannot. It is a lie, it is a lie! - Mr. Proctor. When the devil came to you, did you see Rebecca Nurse in his company? Come, man, take courage. Did you see her with the devil? - No. - [Samuel] Excellency. - Did you see Martha Corey with the devil? - I did not. - [Rev. Hale] Your honor. - Did you see anyone with the devil? - [John] I did not! - You mistake me, Proctor. I am not empowered to trade your life for a lie. Mr. Proctor, a score of people have already testified they saw this woman with the devil. - If it is true, why must I say it? - Why must you say it? - [John] This woman never thought she done the devil's work. - Now, look you, sir, I think you mistake your duty here. What she thought is not the issue. Your soul alone is at stake. And you will prove its whiteness or you cannot live in a Christian country. Will you tell me now what persons conspired with you in the devil's company? - To your knowledge was Rebecca Nurse-- - I speak my own sins, I cannot judge another. I have no talent for it. - [Rev. Hale] Excellency, it is enough he confess himself. Let him sign it! - It is a weighty name, sir. It will strike the village that Proctor confess. (rooster crowing) I beg you, let him sign it. Excellency, the sun is up. - Ah, come then, sign your testimony. Give it to him. (chains jangling) Come, man, sign it. - You have all witnessed it, it is enough. - [Gov. Danforth] You will not sign it? - You have all witnessed it. What more is needed? - [Gov. Danforth] Do you sport with me? You will sign your name or it is no confession, mister! - [Samuel] Praise be to the Lord! - (chuckles) If you please, sir. - No. - Mr. Proctor, I must have the-- - No, no I have signed it. You've seen me. It is done! You have no need for this. - The village must have-- - Damn the village! I confess myself to God. God has seen my name on this! That's enough! Be there no good penitence but it be public? - Mr. Proctor-- - You will not use me! I am no Tituba nor Sarah Good. I am John Proctor! You will not use me! It is no pile of salvation that you should use me! - I do not wish to-- - I have three children. How may I teach them to walk like men in the world and I sold my friends? - You have not sold your-- - Beguile me not! I blacken them all when this is nailed to the church the very day they hang for silence! - Mr. Proctor, I must have good and legal proof-- - You are the high court! Your word is good enough! Tell them I confessed. Say Proctor broke his knees and wept like a woman, say what you will, but my name-- - It is the same, is it not? If I report it or if you sign it. - No, it is not the same! - [Gov. Danforth] Why? - What others say and what I sign is not the same. - Why? Do you mean to deny this confession when you are free? - I mean to deny nothing! - Then explain to me, Mr. Proctor, why you will-- - Because it is my name! Because I will never have another in my life. Because I lie and I sign myself to lies. Because I'm not worth the dust of the feet on them that hang! How may I live without my name? I have given you my soul! Leave me my name! - Is that document a lie? If it is a lie, I will not accept it! What say you? I will not deal in lies. You will give me your honest confession in my hand, or I cannot keep you from the rope. Which way do you go, mister? (John crying) Marshal! - Proctor, oh, Proctor! You will hang! You cannot! - I can. It is the first marvel that I can. Well, you have made your magic now. But now I do think I see some shred of good in John Proctor. Not enough to weave a banner with, but white enough to keep it from such darks. Nah, nah, give them no tear. Tears pleasure them. Show honor now. Show a stony heart and sink them with it. (Elizabeth cries) - Let you fear nothing. Another judgment awaits us all. - Hang them high over the town! Who weeps for these, weeps for corruption. (somber drumming music) (chains jangling) - I've had no breakfast. - Go to him! Go to him, Goody Proctor! There is yet time! Go. Go. Proctor! Proctor! - Woman, plead with him! Go to him. What profit him to bleed? Shall the dust praise him? Shall the worms declare his truth? Go to him, take his shame away. (Elizabeth crying) - He have his goodness now! God forbid I take it from him! (Elizabeth crying) - [Rev. Hale] Not long after, the fever died. Parris was voted from office and was never heard of again. The legend has it that Abigail turned up later as a prostitute in Boston. 20 years after the last execution, the government awarded compensation to the victims still living and to the families of the dead. In solemn meeting, the congregation rescinded the excommunications. This in March 1712. But they did so upon orders of the government. The jury, however, wrote a statement praying forgiveness of all who had suffered. To all intents and purposes, the power of theocracy in Massachusetts was broken. But wherever men have lost all faith in one another, the ancient cry of witch still hovers on the wind and it can still destroy. (somber drumming music)
