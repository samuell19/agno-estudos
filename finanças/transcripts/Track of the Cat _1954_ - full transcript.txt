( Wind howling ) ( cattle bellowing ) Listen. Listen to wind. ( Cattle bellowing ) ( glass clattering ) Curt. ( Grunting ) Maybe I'm just hearin' things. Hey, what's going... ( cattle continue bellowing ) Look out you don't get a fist in the teeth. Curt! ( Gasps ) Huh? Cattle's bawlin'. Something's at them. Is that what you woke me up for? Wait till the wind changes. How long has this been goin' on? Joe Sam just now told me. Thinks it's the cat, huh? The black panther that's big as a horse, and you can see right through him. Shoot at him, and he keeps on comin'. So what are you gonna do, just stand there listenin'? Thought you'd like to know. Thinking's about all you do around here. Get your clothes on. He ain't gonna wait for us. What do you see, Joe Sam? Curt: you see the black panther? Look at him seein' it. Snow come. Black panther come. Let him be! You get him out of here, or I will! I'll finish it today. Go on back to bed. Joe Sam's personal medicine man. Well, I've got the proper medicine for that cat. A .3030 slug right between the eyes. That'll kill him for sure. Unless he's black. ( Chuckles ) Yeah, unless he's black. Hey, wake up! I had a dream I was tryin' to remember. Cat's out there, and he had a dream. Well, they were here when we came and there were more deer than there are now. So don't kill him, huh? Just let him kill stock. The old man and his com stock, and you and the good old days and that old Indian with his cat. ( Clattering ) well, we woke the old lady. Now there'll be 2 of you. We'll never get out. Well, I'm all set. I'll go. No, you won't do, kid. Got to take art in case the cat's black. I wouldn't know what to do if it was black. You could take Joe Sam. No, he'd be for the cat. I don't know if I'd trust you, either. Better let me come along Curt. A million to one it ain't black. Now, you know better than that, kid. You know how Joe Sam gets with the first snow. You're the white hope of the bridges. You stay right here and tend to the future. Don't mess around cookin' anything, Ma. Got to get out in a hurry. Panther's at the stock. Are you goin' alone? No, ma'am. I'm taking art. In case he's black. He'll be like that all the way. Aah, you get so you don't hear him. Seems to me you could wait until daybreak. Won't be many tracks left in this snow. That won't stop Curt. Never has. ( Blowing ) well, I asked for a medicine man, and what do I get? A monk. Did you know we had a monk in the house, ma? Don't blaspheme. No need to hurry as I can see. I'll be a few minutes yet. Art dreamt it was a panther. Had a notion it might be black. I had a dream, and it ain't left me in no mood for jokes. The place is just crawlin' with dreams. Did you have any, kid? No, I wouldn't waste my time dreamin' either, if I had a girl like Gwen. Watch your mouth! Now, what'd I say, ma? All I said, with a girl like Gwen, who'd waste his time dreamin'? Curt likes a dream he can lay his hands on. Curt: yes, sir. I said, watch your mouth! Hal ain't like art, ma. Old art's a monk. Hal, he's just a kid, and already he's got... you hear me, Curtis? Well, I'm no kid, either. I'm 37, art's 43, and the old man's nobody knows how far past 70. ( Girls laughing ) You go bossin' the bunch of us like we was kids. Can't even make a little joke. The girls is awake in there. You want Gwen Williams to hear you? Now what did I say, ma? Just tell me one little thing I said. Wouldn't take any fancy guessin' to know what you mean. Well now, if we're gonna start guessin', anything I said about Gwen Williams is brotherly love compared to what you... let it go, Curt. ( Girls laughing ) Curt: Just thought maybe the kid might like to know what his ma thinks of his girl. If you're in such an all-fired hurry to get out after that cat, you'd better be gettin' them ponies saddled. And don't go takin' holy names in vain every time you open your mouth. ( Girls continue laughing ) They're likely to be a long time, if you was figurin' on waitin'. Curt: Ask her what she thinks of your girl. ( Girls continue laughing ) They're having a good time in there. Yeah. Ain't they, though? Don't you think it'd be better if Harold would go instead of you, the way Curt's takin' on this morning? He can't very well with Gwen just come. Her first visit, too. She's gotta be broke into the rest of us kind of gradual, and he better do it. Harold, have you thought any how you're gonna live when you get married? Well, it hasn't gone that far, yet. Well, it's what you want, ain't it? It's for sure what the Williams think you want all the time you've been sittin' in their kitchen. Well, I...I guess so, if she does. You needn't worry too much about that. Not with all the money this ranch could make and that gopher hole the Williamses live in. She's not that kind, ma. What kind is she? Have you got a name for her I haven't got? Was you expectin' to bring her in this house to live? No, I...I don't think so. Well, then, what was you figurin' on doin'? Does it have to be settled right now, Mother? Now is just as good a time as any. She don't think she was asked over here just to keep an old maid like grace company. Harold's too young to get married, and to an older woman at that. You talk like she was 50! She's not 2 years older than I am! 2 or 20, you're a child compared to her. You couldn't even support a wife, even if she was proper for you, which she ain't. What do you want, mother? One of these days, the Bridgeses are gonna die out. Is that what you want? Harold's found a girl. You think you'd be glad, instead of turning against her. ( Girls laughing ) It's been a long time since grace laughed like that. And your pa primpin' himself, just for her. They wouldn't have to live here. We could have an old-fashioned house-raising. I thought that was just about where we was headin'. Well, why not? This is a big valley. It can hold a lot more stock than we've been running. We could have one drive, one roundup, same as ever. Only let Hal take out his share. Splittin' things. Once the splittin' starts, it never stops. Dad owes him the start. It's been a long time since your pa's had any say about anythin'. Have you spoken to Curt? That's where it sticks, doesn't it? That's where everything sticks. Well, one of these days. One of these days. That's the Bridges motto around here. Harold, why don't you go with Curt? If you're waitin' on Arthur, the only one he really stands up for around here is that no-good Indian. Now's your chance to stand up for yourself. Go along with him, and then you could talk to him while you're huntin' the panther. Well, don't think I won't. Of course you will. Then you'll have something to tell your girl when you get back. Come on, ma. You know what Curt will say. Besides, he might need me if the cat's black. What are you carvin' that thing for? I have a mind to throw it in the stove. Joe Sam likes a god he can see. LETTY: you and your heathen nonsense, your godless jokes. Keep it up, and you'll be believin' them the same as that no-good Indian. If I had my way, I'd throw him off the place. ( Neighing ) Come on, here! What's the matter with you? Move! ( Neighing ) What's bothering you, Kentuck? Take her out! And quit spooking Kentuck! Boo. ( Girls laughing ) ( whistling ) The girls up yet? Arthur: No, not yet, but any minute now. Fine, then I can get my shaving done before they come out. ( Girls laughing ) ( laughing ) ( mimicking pa ) Letty, some hot water, if you please. ( Slurping ) Letty, I asked you! Just who do we think we are this morning? John Mackey seein' Paris, or Leland Stanford on his private train? It must seem evident that with company in the house it wouldn't do any harm for one member of this family to put it... here you go, dad. Hmm. To put in a decent appearance. Thank you, son. It's gratifying for a man to receive any consideration at all in his own house. 71 this last summer. You'd think a man that old wouldn't have enough head left to turn. ( Girls continue laughing ) Well, shaving, Mr. Bridges? Shavin' himself raw just for her. Those young ladies are certainly having the time of their lives in there, huh? I told you not to bother cooking, ma. Horses are ready, art. Where are you goin'? You can't go without some food in your belly. Well, the storm's lettin' up. We got a pretty good chance of getting him if we get up there before daylight. Get what? What's he talking about? What makes you so sure it's a panther? What else would make the cattle bellow the way they was? It's a panther all right. Maybe it's a bear. The snow could be worryin' them. No. I know it's a cat. Probably the same one that got my dogs last year. I'm gonna get him this time, if I have to chase him clear to Placerville. Well, I'll tell you one thing. You ain't gonna nail the next hide up on the house. Not even if it's black? Not if it's red, white, and blue. Such a stink every time the door was open. ( laughs ) Yeah, but a black one, ma. Might bring some good luck to the house. Well, I'll take less luck if it'll make less stink. Sit down. I'll get you some breakfast. You better take Hal's rifle. That old sharp's of yours is about as much use as throwin' rocks. No use takin' a gun if it's Joe Sam's kind of cat. Better take your snowshoes. Won't need 'em. We'll get him up on the north draw, if we get him at all. He'll be in there. He can't be anyplace but there. The bellowing come from the north. He's got to be in there. Too bad that ain't finished. If a bullet don't stop him, we might need it. Ok. I hope it snows for a whole week, then. Good morning, my dear! Good morning! Come. Come sit down beside me. Right here. Letty will have breakfast for you in no time at all. Thank you, Mr. Bridges. Cup of coffee for miss Williams, Letty. And my bottle and the glass from the cupboard, if you don't mind. Nothing like a little cheer on a cold, cold morning, huh? Better watch the old goat. He'll steal your girl. I must apologize for my sons, Miss Williams. If they were gentlemen, they'd apologize for waking you at this unseemly hour. But gallantry is dead. Well, I sure hate to break up this little party just when it's getting so good but we got a call to make, art and me. Old friend of Joe Sam's. It's only a foolish joke, Miss Williams, and a worn-out one at that. We're in kind of a hurry, so Hal will have to explain it to you the best he can. Which is kind of too bad in a way, because Arthur's the one that really knows. He talks to the thing. Come on, Curt, let's go. Joe Sam's freezing out here. Why are you going? Well, you don't think I could handle a black panther by myself, do you, Gracie? An ordinary yellow one, maybe, but not a black one. You don't have to go. If he's so set on going, let him go alone. It doesn't take 2 to shoot at a shadow. Grace, you're gettin' yourself all worked up. Why do you do whatever he wants? You know you do. You always do! I'll bring your little arty back home safe and sound, Gracie. Now, don't you worry. If it was just you, I'd wish it was black. Yes, I would! You and your cheap sneer and your self-importance. Always judgin' others by yourself. Grace! He does. He always does! He's a cheap, dirty-mouthed bully! ( Grace muttering ) *( playing )* Well, if there's a cat out there, Curt will get him. He's just about the best hunter I know. He has a gift for it. I remember one year... I don't guess Gwendolyn's so crazy to hear about Curt's fancy shootin'. It's getting so it's impossible to have a little sociable conversation around here. Eat your breakfast, Miss Williams. Go ahead and eat. We've lost even the most ordinary consideration in this wilderness. All sense of the amenities of civilization. You have no idea the pleasure it is to have you under this roof. It reminds us of ourselves. A little. Heaven knows we need to be reminded. The true pleasure, of course, is your presence. Thank you. No, thank you. Come on in, Joe Sam. Joe Sam, get over by the fire. Don't mind him, my dear. He's seeing things. Always happens with the first snow. Drink this coffee. It'll make you warm. Not cold. Him and his black panthers. Every year we go through the same nonsense. He claims it comes with the first snow. That's what the carvings are about. Medicine, help him fight it off. Only Arthur missed this year, with the snow coming early. That's why he's this way. LETTY: "oh, that I were as in the months of old "as in the days when god watched over me "when his lamp shined upon my head and by his light, I walked through darkness." You never told me about him. Well now, when a young man has to ride all that way to get in a little courting, you'd hardly expect him to waste any words talking about the hired help. Arthur's the only one he ever talks to. Pack of lies, that's what he says. He was a brave when Fremont camped at pyramid lake. He remembers the brass cannon, the kind of buttons Fremont wore on his coat, a lot of other little things that couldn't be lies. Things he says would make him more than 100 years old. He was a war chief when they had that fight on the Truckee. He spoke at the last council before that fight. His sons were all killed in that battle. That was way over 60 years ago, so he must be pretty old. They took an awful licking, and after that they scattered all over the country. Joe Sam took his family... well, just his wife and daughter left by then. They went up into the mountains around Shasta. That's where the black panther got started. They were camped up in the woods in the high country. His wife and daughter went down the creek to get some water. He heard them screaming. He got down as fast as he could and saw the cat going off through the willows. It happened during the first snow. Arthur thinks that the cat is Joe Sam's personal spirit. It stands for the whole business of being run out by the whites. ( Footsteps pattering ) Sit down, Grace. Do you want something to eat? If I could have a cup of coffee, please. What is it? The Indian, he was right there. ( Neighing ) Whoa. Whoa. He's been here all right. His stink is still in the air. He's a big one. Maybe not as big as Joe Sam's cat. He's big. Look at that, will you? Look what he's done. Trail's still fresh as a daisy. There's blood on him. He must've got horned. He'll be mean. Yeah. He's been feeding. He's eating mighty high for a cat. ( Neighs ) Hold him down, will you? Keep him quiet! It's the steer. Blood's spooking him. The steer? What do you mean "the steer"? You got 3 of 'em. Count 'em. 2 of my best year-olds and the cross - that bull I been plannin' on. He's finished, too, by the look of him. Arthur: Your steer? You're always talkin' about this valley like it was your valley. The only plans that mean anything around here are your plans. Well, other people have plans, too. Not me, but Harold might. He's thinking of getting married. No ordinary cat to break up a bunch like this. Must have been the bull horned him, by the look of it. It's gonna be a mean cat. We've always worked together. Put everything together in one pot. You're the only one who's ever done any taking. I imagine Harold will want to do some taking for a change. Yeah, we'll talk about it. That's what we're doing right now. Talking about it. I'm telling you how it's gonna be. How is it gonna be, art? We're gonna work together, same as we always have. Only Hal's gonna get his share without asking for it. Without waiting for you to hand it out. If it wasn't for me, there wouldn't be any valley, wouldn't be any stock. The cats would have it all. The Indians would have it. You'd have given it back to 'em a long time ago. I built this all up. It's Hal's, too. He's worked. Gonna get married, huh? Gonna get him a wife and settle down. Well, she's a nice girl. She'll make a fine wife, married to that no-man kid. Why didn't he come to me, talk to me himself instead of gettin' you to stand up for him? I stand up for you, too, Curt. Have you ever thought how things would be around here if you had your way? No. How would it be, Arty? Tell me how it would be. First thing, I'd run that Indian off the place. Anybody else that didn't carry his weight would clear out, too. I'd whip this valley into shape. In no time at all, you'd have nothin' left to shoot nothin' left to fight, nothin' left to flatten. You wouldn't have anybody to yell at. There wouldn't be anybody but you. Then what would you do, Curt? ( laughing ) Well, there's one thing I'm gonna do, and I'm gonna do it right now. There's a cat been killin' our stock. I'm gonna walk up there and take a look and if I see him, I'm gonna put a bullet right between his eyes. That is, if you don't mind. He was up there all right, but he ain't now. Lit out while you were shooting off your face. Cleared the rim rock, and up the north side. Ah, he'll be back. Oh, sure. It would've been an easy shot in here, too. Well, we could take the horses over on the other side where he wouldn't get wind of them and wait him out. You could wait till kingdom come, couldn't you? Well, I can't. I'm gonna track him down. You can't go a mile in those boots. You'll need snowshoes and some food. You'd like to go back to the house, wouldn't you? So you can tell 'em all how you told me off, playin' the lovin' priest. Thanks. I'll go myself. Get what I need, and get it now instead of sometime next week. Fine. You can forget I said anything. Talk to Harold yourself. Here. Careful, it's loaded. Be sure to snap the safety off if you have to use it. You hold trail till I get back. Be sure and drag a deep track in case it snows and you get lost. If he's still around, you'd better see him first. So don't get to moonin'. Curt! The girl means a lot to Harold. Don't go cutting him down, making him look foolish in her eyes. ( Neighing ) ( neighing ) ( panther snarls ) ( gun clicks ) ( screaming ) ( panther growling ) Was it a panther? Big one. Made tracks the size of a horse. Are you goin' after him? Sure gonna try. Get some grub ready, ma. Bread and jerky's all I'll need. ( Snorting ) Curt: what's she trying to do, make a pet out of Kentuck? First thing you know, she'll have all the Bridges tamed. The only one she's interested in taming is Harold. Shouldn't have too much trouble there. He's got about as much spirit as a gelding. What's the matter, Joe Sam? Where Arthur? Poor old Art. Doesn't anybody think he can take care of himself? Even got the half-wit worryin'. Don't you want to ask me about the cat, Joe Sam? He killed 4 of my stock. But he got horned, and he left tracks, so he can't be black. Where is Arthur? Why didn't he come? Now, don't worry, sis. If he's black, he'll be for art. If he's yellow, I left him my gun. ( Shouts ) get on. One thing, if he's black, he's gonna make a fine blanket for your bed with a hard winter comin' on and that bashful kid for a husband. Don't mind him, Gwen. We are gonna have a wedding, ain't we? We don't have to listen to his foul mouth. Hey. You saddle Kentuck and see to it that you don't forget to soap his hooves. I hear you're gonna build your house right here in the valley. Did Harold discuss it with you? No, but Arthur did. The kid sure got everybody diggin' for him. I'm wondering who he got to pop the question for him. Uh, Grace maybe? Don't answer him, Gwen. Bet he hasn't even kissed you yet. Waiting for somebody to do that for him, too. Hey, ma? Hey, ma, if that panther's black, I'm gonna skin it and give it to Gwen for a wedding present. She can lay it right on top of her at night. Make him stop, mother. Why don't you make him stop? He's trying to spoil everything. The black panther's the cause of all the trouble in the world. He's the evil in everybody. Joe Sam says so, Arthur says so, and grace says so. Even Hal out there. I believe he'd say so, too, if he had half a mind. It's all right, grace. Why, sure, it's all right. Just think how peaceful you're gonna sleep, if you ever get around to sleepin'. With the end of all the troubles in the world right there over you to prove that nothing can go wrong. Here's your grub. I put in just what you told me. But I think you ought to have more. No, that's plenty, ma. Why don't you dress in your own room? Wouldn't want me to freeze, would you? All right, Miss Williams, you can turn around now. Of course, if it's just an ordinary panther, it wouldn't be big enough for a blanket. Might make a costume out of it, though. You could give us a special wedding dance. I'm not much of a dancer. Well, I'll show you. You'd learn in no time. Harold's here with Kentuck. Is that so? The times that kid picks to be fast. He may even get around to telling me his plans one of these days. I thought Arthur told you. What did he say? Just that there's gonna be a wedding. LETTY: There can't be no wedding till Harold asks her and he ain't asked her yet, that I know of. Has he asked? No, he's probably waitin' on that, too. ( Neighing ) HAROLD: whoa. Whoa. Frisky, ain't he? Well, what do you say, Joe Sam? You think it's the black panther? Joe Sam! What say? That's better. You speak quick when you're spoken to. You think it's the black panther? Snow come. Much snow. ( Chuckling ) Just plain snow is all he's got on his mind and here I was hopin' it was the cat. LETTY: don't you play the fool, Curtis. If it starts to snow then you get yourself home fast as you can. Well, you wouldn't want me to come home without a present for Gwen's wedding bed, would you? I'm gonna shoot him right in the eye, so as I won't spoil the pelt. Now, what's on your mind, kid? Tell him, Harold. Don't be afraid. Tell him. Ain't a thing on his mind. ( Neighs ) the mare must've thrown him. Must've spooked and threw him. Come on. ( Birds twittering ) He waited on that rock. He jumped him from the rock. ( Neighing ) Boo, Kentuck. Easy, boy. It's Art, boy. ( Neighing ) Now hold, you hear? The cat-stink's on him. Is that it, boy? Boo, Kentuck. Boo, boy. Boo, now. Boo. Boo. Boo, boy. Boo. Boo. Boo, boy. Boo. Boo. Boo, boy. Get on home, now! Get! I'm gonna get him, Art. I'm gonna get him. ( Neighing ) ( continues neighing ) It's Curt! It's not Arthur. It's Curt. Get back to the house. It's Curt, Mother. It's Curt. No, it's Arthur. ( Grace shrieking ) ( Grace sobbing ) Mother, get back to the house. Mother! Where's Curt? Why didn't Curt come? Take his feet. LETTY: put him in the north bedroom. ( Door creaking ) I gotta lay him out proper. You better let me help, ma. No. You go along. And you better take the whiskey out of the cupboard. Your pa's drunk enough. Gwen will fix you some supper, dad. No hurry. ( Hiccupping ) no hurry at all. A very attractive, young woman, Gwen. You're a lucky boy to get such a woman. LETTY: Harold! His neck's broke. There are claw marks on his shoulders. Where's Curt? It's...it's dark out there. He should've come home with Arthur. ( Wind howling ) you'll have to hole up, too. I'll get you in the morning. Mother. Come on out and get some supper. It's so cold in here. You better put on your shawl. Fetch me my bible. He used to talk such foolishness. I was always lettin' it go in one ear and out the other, like you got to do with Curt's swearin', knowin' it don't mean a thing. But Arthur did mean somethin', didn't he? It was mostly Curt and me. Just the two of us against him. The rest of you was always going along, lettin' him fight your fights. Him alone against us. He was a strange son for your Pa and me to have. Like the Lord put somethin' in him that wasn't in either of us. I been tryin' to pray. But it don't come right. How's Grace? She just sits there. She was so foolish fond of him. Curt come home yet? He wouldn't even try in this snow. He probably holed up somewhere till it's daylight. He must've got a long way out, a long way. Hello. Let me alone, please. This morning, I think I hate the Bridgeses. Especially that old man over there. The things he said to me. What did he say? What did he say? He's worried about Curt, that's all. It doesn't matter what he said. Yes, it does! What did he say? He thinks I'm to blame for Arthur dying, for Curt not coming back. He said none of it would have happened if I hadn't made eyes at Curt. Harold! He's so drunk, he doesn't know what he's sayin'. You better go in to your mother. LETTY: is the snow gonna stop? It's let up some. Is there enough boards for the coffin? The lumber Curt got for the tack room. There's the grave to dig yet. Curt? You young fool, chasing out after panthers in a blizzard. And was it black? Who is this woman? What's she doing in my house? It's Gwen, dad. Huh? Gwen? Gwendolyn Williams. I have no recollection of a Gwendolyn. Her name strikes no chord. Oh, yeah. Lou Williams' daughter. She's a charming girl. I'm surprised at you, Curt, letting a young whippersnapper like... where's Curt? You know where he is. Where's my bottle? Thieving women. The place is crawling with them. Curt's out hunting. That's where he is. Oh, he's a great shot. I remember once, when he was only a youngster, 13, 14, somewhere around there, down on old Jake Haley's ranch on the Carson River, ( chuckles ) he won a turkey shoot! You should have seen old jake's face. Always gets what he's after, that boy. Never gives up till he's got it right there in his hand. That's a thing for you to keep in mind, Miss Williams. Oh, I beg your pardon, young woman. I apologize. Inexcusable, absolutely inexcusable. It's all right, Mr. Bridges. ( Scoffing ) you hear that, Curt? It's all right, she says. You're a lucky boy, Curt. ( Sighing ) you know, I... I keep forgetting he's not here. He's out hunting. A panther killed Arthur. Only I...I thought it was Curt. Oh, why did he take Curt's coat, huh? You keep things from me, hold secrets in my own house. Why? I know. I saw him on the bed in there. A black panther. ( Sniffs ) Dad, why don't you go to bed? Yes, indeed. And get some sleep. Only first, a drop to keep me warm. Please. Next thing, you'll want to carry me upstairs. ( Glass shattering ) ( wind howling ) ( birds chirping ) poor little fellows. I wanted to go, and you stopped me, all by yourself. Nobody did it for you. Why don't you do that in everything? You'll kiss me if I make the first move. You'll be alone with me if I lead you by the hand. You keep standing back with me, with your mother, and with Curt. Arthur used to speak up for you, but Arthur's dead now. What do you want? Isn't there anything you want enough to ask for it? Are you afraid to ask Curt for what's rightfully yours? There wouldn't be any ranch if it wasn't for Curt. Squatters would have taken it away from us a long time ago, but he drove 'em out. It was all finished by the time I grew up. He did it all by himself. It just doesn't seem fair for me to get married and move in on him, and demand my share. He's got to offer it to me. Gwen? Gwen? ( Door closing ) Joe Sam, take that end. Joe Sam! I seen you up there with her. I couldn't help seein' her forcin' herself on you, right there in plain sight. And your brother ain't in his grave yet. Little mucker's brat! And that ain't the least of what she is. I never been one to mince words, but I wouldn't dirty my mouth naming her. You bring her into this house knowin' what she is. I'd send her packin' this minute, bag and baggage, only I won't... Take me home! Harold! You'll do no such thing. You'll finish the coffin. With Curt gone, you'll dig the grave, too. She can make the... never mind. I'll go, and I won't need his help. Mother, you're making a filthy lie out of nothin'. What's she done, anyway? You're always talking as if you were god around here. Don't blaspheme! Me, blaspheme? This house is rotten with the gods you've made. Yours and Curt's. With pride and money and greed. See here, Grace. You can squint your eyes at me, but you can't frighten me. Think how happy Curt was when he found Arthur out there. He's been robbing him for years, taking his share, time after time with your blessing. "To improve the ranch," he says. His ranch. They've got you believing in it, too. You believe them. Arthur's dead. You don't seem to know what that means. It was Arthur who kept Curt from selling this place right out from under us. Curt was afraid of him, but now he's dead. And Curt has everything his way. And all with the blessings of mother's wicked, selfish, ugly gods! PA: what's going on down there? What's going on, I say? All this screaming. Ask Mother. She's the one. Your daughter's screaming blasphemous nonsense. Holy, holy, holy! LETTY: We've listened to about enough of this. You get back in that bedroom and stay there until you can keep a decent tongue in your head. Listen to her, with her righteousness. She's sending Gwen home. Grace, get back in that room, you hear? Sending her home? Yes, yes, yes. What are you sending her home for, Letty? Go on, ask her. She's the eye of god, she sees everything. What did you see, Letty? Awful things. Let me go. I want to go. Please, let me go. You... you and your Bible. For all your reading, it's amazing how little you understand. You dirty everything with your nasty mind. I seen you. Ho, ho, the little one. Curt's intended. He's out hunting cats, and he's got one right here waiting for him. What did you see? Tell him, mother. You're the one who saw them. What did you see? They was actin' up in the shed. Acting? Like what? She was kissin' him the way no decent... kissing him? She was kissing him! Hot diggity! I wish I'd seen that! Now, you listen to me, old woman. Kissing's what we need around here. Lots of kissing! The more kissing, the better. ( Scoffs ) I could use a few myself. Never had enough, far back as I remember. Clear beyond recollection, that's how long the need's been. You with your stingy little purse of a mouth. Did you watch 'em? Huh? Did you learn anything? ( Mimics kissing ) ( sighing ) I wish you thieving females would leave my bottle alone. ( Mimics kissing ) clothespin, that's what you are. Always have been a clothespin, always will be a clothespin. I've got to keep drunk to forget I'm married to a clothespin. Is that all it means to you? After a lifetime of slavin' and lookin' after you, and bearin' young ones? That's all it means. You want a woman like that in your house. Sure, why not? You're here, aren't you? Make her apologize, father. Oh, shut up. Clothespins, both of you. You're not human. Heh. She's human. No clothespin at all. If she is, she's a mighty pretty clothespin. Curt's bride. ( Door closing ) We mustn't let mother send Gwen away, father. She has to apologize, or Gwen will go away. Of course not. I said so, didn't I? Curt's intended. Harold's, father. That's right. Not Curt's, Harold's. Too much woman for Harold. I'm going away, and you can't stop me. If you don't let me take a horse, I'll walk. When your back is turned, I'll get away. Gwen... Gwen! Gwen! Is that all you can say? You're not goin' anyplace, not even when my back's turned! I've had enough trouble without any more out of you! You're stayin' till I dig the grave. Get over in the bunkhouse and wait. When I'm finished, I'll take you home. ( Wind howling ) well, what do you know? I beat you here, didn't I? You bet I did. You're not dealing with art this time. He just never could learn to stop moonin'. I'm gonna put one right between your eyes, and I'm gonna skin you and I'm gonna lay your pelt cozy in her lap. She'll get her blanket, all right. And I'm gonna charge her for it. Don't you think I won't. My own price, and no tricks. I got all the time in the world. I got lots of time. I got enough grub to last me for a week... "when I have fears that I may cease to be" I've gotta get home. I've gotta get home. Now just take it easy. You'll get home. You're all right. You've got a good fire. You're not out there in the cold. It's bound to let up soon. You're not lost. I'm worried about your father and grace, and your mother, alone in that cold room. They'll be all right. Somebody has to take care of them. Not you. It'll only cause trouble. You wait here. I'll get your things. We're goin' now. He's taking Gwen home. Mother, tell him he can't go. Have you finished the grave? Up on the hill. No, you can't go. Tell him, mother. Bring her here. If that's what you want. She wants to go home. Mother, I said a lot of terrible things. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Oh, I am. You'll say that much to Gwen, won't you? That you're sorry. Then Harold won't have to go. ( Door opening ) No, Harold! Please! I'll go get Gwen. Mother will tell her she's sorry. You will, won't you? Yes, she will! You'd leave us with everything the way it is. I'm half out of my mind, thinkin' something's happened to Curt. I got the coffin lined ready for Arthur. I'll be back tomorrow. It can't wait. You can't put it off until tomorrow. You've got to do it now. Joe Sam, Hmm? Help Harold. Evening, everybody! Good evening. Good evening. Go to bed. Bed? Oh, this decrepit old body is already galled with sleep. What I want is a drink. Oh, where's my bottle? Some thieving female's stolen my bottle. Ah. The one true friend of man. Hmm. Warm, too. Wrap him in that black-and-white spread. He was always partial to it when he was a little feller. He used to run his fingers over the trees and the birds and beasts. Like he was drawin' them himself. I'd like we should have a preacher. Not much chance of that. You should do the talkin' by rights. ( Wind blowing ) where is Curt? Where is that boy? He should be back. When is he coming back? Joe Sam. Joe Sam! *( playing ) You done real good, pickin' this spot, Harold. It's close to home. I guess you'd better put him in. Everybody pray according to your own heart. Amen. Can't preach no proper sermon. Don't seem much use if I could. He was a hard one to know. Even if I could make out clear every last thing about him, body and soul had words to tell, don't know as it would help. If the lord won't judge him, surely ain't my place to judge. He was a good man, like he was a good boy. Not a mean streak in him. All the things I could say ( quavering ) seems to me I could've said them when he was alive. Mother, we're going now. When will you be back? I've decided to stay with Gwen's folks. They want me to. Oh, I'm glad! I'm glad! What will you do in aspen? Work in the mines, like her pa? Bury yourself in the ground before your time? He's buried here. We all are. But you'll be happy, that's what counts. You'd better go before she changes your mind. Dad, I... look at me blubbering. Why? Because Arthur's dead? If I could shed this garment flesh and die, too, I'd rejoice. Yes, I would. This body of mine hangs on, festering. Well, my little congregation. In the good book, Psalms, 63rd chapter, 7th verse, David said: "Therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice." and Arthur is in the shadow of his wings. Curt, too, for all I know. ( Pa chuckling ) PA: You never thought I read the good book, did you? Well, I do, and not with the tip of my finger, either. "Make a joyful noise unto the Lord," David said. And that's what I'm going to do, make a joyful noise. Yea, I will sing! * Ev'ry time I feel the spirit * * Moving in my heart, I will pray * Hush up! * Ev'ry time I * Huh? Sacrilege you do. One son dead, maybe 2. The last one abandoning us and you sing. What's that you say? We're bein' abandoned, that's what we are. Harold's going to live in Aspen. Don't listen to her, Harold. LETTY: if Curt ain't back by this afternoon, somebody's got to build a fire to guide him home. Let Joe Sam do it! Oh, sure. Joe Sam's so fond of Curt. Then dad will do it. It's not up to Harold. LETTY: of course. Why didn't I think of that myself? Dad will do it. * Ev'ry time I feel the spirit * * Moving in my heart * LETTY: Shut up! Go. You're free to go. We're no concern of yours anymore. If you don't go now, you never will. You know that, don't you? I could've gone once. I never did. Look at me now. If he had the courage, he'd tell you he doesn't feel any different than Joe Sam. Why don't you tell her you don't want to build a fire? But he will. Come on, Joe Sam. Thieving women. ( Sobbing ) ( rumbling ) ( panting ) Easy, boy. Nothin' will start a cat quicker than runnin'. ( Wind blowing ) "When I have fears" "When I have fears that I may cease to be" the only time any good ever came of your mooning, boy. ( Gun firing ) ( gun firing ) ( exclaiming ) ( screaming ) Harold. Harold? Harold? GWEN: Do you have to answer? HAROLD: what do you want? Go put some more wood on the fire! All right! Harold? Some bedspread... the black-and-white one we put around Arthur. Wake up, Harold. Darling, you were talking in your sleep. What did I say? Nothing. Your mother wants to see you. She's worried about Curt. I... I dreamed we were up in the valley, you and Arthur and me. It was beautiful. Curt wasn't with us. Then he was, and everything changed. HAROLD: did you want me, mother? Sit down. The fire's gone down. You let it go down. It's getting daybreak, ma. PA: Ah! Getting breakfast already, young woman? That's fine! I can do with a good breakfast. Where's Harold disappeared to? Has he gone out looking for Curt? I just keep wonderin'. Seems like I ain't seen a thing clear for what it really was. Your pa didn't want to come out here, clear in the middle of no place. Sometimes I think it's worse for Grace. A woman's meant to have her man and children. Without she's got 'em, she ain't able to come to herself rightly. Oh, why doesn't he go if he's going? His own brother out there, lost God knows where. He sleeps all night on the table like some drunk in a backroom. Curt's the only man in the lot. ( Quavering ) I've done wrong. Curt has to come home. He can't die with my sin on his soul. It was my doin'. Whatever he done, he done to please me. Don't worry, ma. I'll go out. I'll find him. "Behold, thou art fair, my love, "behold, thou art fair, thou has doves' eyes within thy locks." Please, Mr. Bridges, eat your breakfast before it gets cold. ( Pa scoffs ) not only can she cook, she's a comfort to an aging heart. She's the rose of Sharon. It's daybreak. I'd better get started. Before it gets too late. I thought I'd take a run up creek canyon. Maybe take a look up top. You'll get lost in all that snow. Take Joe Sam with you. He can read signs where nobody else would see a thing. Now you take Joe Sam. I'll rest easier in my soul. And what do you think you'll find? Well he's gonna find Curt and bring him back. You want him to find Curt, don't you, Grace? It's so peaceful here without him. Things will be the same as always when he gets back. Yes, I want Harold to find him. Of course you do. He's your born brother. But now, you got to believe. You got to believe the same as I believe that Curt's out there somewhere, or you won't half look. You're the same as Dad, only you use hope instead of whiskey. He's been out there 3 days. I been thinkin' pretty near all night. I got a feelin' he's alive. He might have gone way back in. The cat would head for the high country with somebody after him. Well now, don't you go lookin' for that panther, Harold. Don't get led on past sense. Start back with enough daylight to get you home. If you ain't done no good by noon, you head on back. No good riskin' yourself, you hear? Promise. Panther not kill Curt. Night, dark, Curt afraid. He run. What was he runnin' from? In him. ( Panther growling ) you want I go? No. ( Gun cocks) ( panther snarling ) ( gun fires ) ( gun fires ) ( panther growling ) Curt not kill. You kill. Him devil. The black panther? No. Not black, black panther. Whole world. Got good blanket for bed now. You get married, huh? Maybe. That's up to her. She marry. No more trouble. You boss man now.
