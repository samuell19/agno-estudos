Hello, Sarah. How do you know my name? Your paintings speak to me. No! No, don't run! Help! No! Help! Help! Wait! Stop! Stop! Doctor Morris dial 115 please. Sarah, I'm detective Sousa. How you feeling this morning? Doctor tells me that the wound just missed your heart. You're very lucky. I don't feel lucky. I don't blame you. It's an awful... awful thing this man did. So, I guess you haven't caught him yet. No. You feel up to answering a few questions. How clearly, do you remember him? Very. Sorry, this is taking so long. I think I got him this time. Closer? A little. Although... Face was more angular. You mean like, more cheek bones? Can I borrow your pencil a sec? It's him. Theodore we've got the knife with your fingerprints and her blood on it. Now, where do you figure that leaves you? That's great Einstein, you don't say a word. I tell you what, why don't I... drop by the state pen on your 60th birthday and say "hello." You'll be dead by then. I know you're a smart guy. Why don't you help yourself and level with me? Why'd you do it? Do what? The name's Theodore Gray. He's got a record. Harassment, obsessive type stuff. You've got a real gift, Sarah. We would have never gotten this guy without your drawing. Don't worry, he can't see you. Yes, he can. Mr. Gray, you have been found guilty of armed assault with the intent to kill. Your's was a brutal, senseless and despicable crime for which you seem to be totally unrepentant. I hereby order you to serve 15-25 years in State Prison. My only regret, sir, is that I cannot impose a longer sentence. Ma'am, I never thought it was gonna take this long to pick all this stuff up. But I want this office to be, you know, me. There'll be someone someone to help you with that. Whoa! Feel a little case of sticker shock here. Let me ask you something. What if I ask Aaron Webber to... do me up a bid. They would probably bid lower. Okay, so... I'm doing business with you because... Well, we are more selective about our work force. Which means higher labor costs. But it also means that all of your floors and light fixtures, mean everything actually be installed perfectly and on time. Okay, you got me. Here you go. Sarah, thanks for helping me with all this. I know I can be a pain in the ass. Don't deny it. Everybody else will. You did great, Brett. Yeah. -Yes? -Here, file that. Hank Freeman phoned again. What a pest he is. And, your husband, votre mari, said he would be back at seven. And there's a call for you on line one. Thanks. Hello. Hi, this is Val from First credit. A Rebecca Shapiro applied for a visa card. We need to verify her salary. Yes, Rebecca earns $80,000 a year. Okay that's all we needed. Thanks. Thanks, Sarah. I've been trying to get a card but my credit's a disaster. -Perspective exercises? -Yeah. Client nightmare. You nervous, Sarah. No. Remind Rebecca to send silk swatches to Mrs. Carlucci. Umm... So, what did I do to deserve this? It's what you're going to do. Really, now you've a say in the matter. Well, I plan on rendering you speechless. What you staring at? Nothing. No, you were staring at my scar. No, I wasn't. There's nothing to stare at. -It's not even noticeable. -It is to me. Let's not get away from the big picture, anyway. Umm... You know, we really shouldn't. Ir's right in the middle of my cycle and... That's part of the plan. Let's make today the day. Okay, just stop. Well, great. What else is new? So, I really messed things up, didn't I? You just went hot and cold Sarah. Specially when it comes to kids. You know, I thought, you know, maybe if I made it more festive. Look I want to have a baby, Michael, I do. What we've been married two years? I'm 43 years old. So... when do you see this happening? I'm just not ready yet. When I used to say that to women it meant never. Well, that's not what it means when I say it, okay. Did something happen at the office today? Why would you ask that? Because we tend to have this discussion when things go badly at work. Spare me the psycho-analysis, okay. So I was right, something did happen. What was it? They want me to go to Washington, to testify hearings for the insurance industry. Okay, so how did you get stuck with this? Because nice guys finish last. I gotta convince the Senate committee, that we didn't engage in any illegal ratings practices. Which of course we did. Right. So they want you to lie. And, I hate it. I hate knowing that I am the bad guy. Well, I've got 16 years at Monolith, 'cause I gotta be the good company man, you know. Michael you're miserable in this job. Why don't you just quit? Well, you have things you aren't ready to do. So, do I. -Hi. -Nick. I'm sorry for dropping by like this. Sarah, I really need your help on this sketch. Hey, hey Michael. Right Michael, he's a friend and he hasn't asked in a really long time. You don't owe him anything. What gives him the right to even ask you? Listen, I wouldn't be doing this, if it wasn't really important. I got a witness that may not last through the night. It could be a tough time coming here. Theodore Gray's parole hearing's next week. I know it's not gonna be easy for you to testify. Still gonna be there, right? Yeah, of course. So, Michael... he still doesn't know, about this does he, about Gray, about any of it? No and umm, I would like to keep it that way, okay, Nick? Her name's Dana Pennington, male, white attacker, that's all we know. And, what you should know, she's in real bad shape. Lights, lights are flashing. Dana can you hear me? I'm so glad you're here, mama. That's you right, mama? Yeah, it's me honey. Can you tell me about the man that hurt you? Did he have a round face or a long face? Long, wore black cap, winter. Okay, winter cap that's good. Before, he flashed his lights, You mean, headlights? Hold my hand! Tighter. Don't let go, don't let go! I won't, it's okay. I love you, mama. Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, it's okay. It's okay, it's just a dream. You've been like this every time you do one of those sketches. Why do you put yourself through this? Because I know it makes a difference. It does damage, to you, to us. Come on, we've talked this one to death okay, Sarah. I want you to quit. It's time. Sarah. Hey, listen I gotta run. So, promise me that you'll talk to Nick. Okay? What are these? Some new artist. Very hot I'm told. Who would hang these in their home? People with awful taste. Which is much of our client has so... I thought we should keep it on file. Hi, can I help you? Mrs. Reynolds. Hank Freeman. Rebecca why don't you take a break. How dare you come here. I'm only acting on behalf of my client. I want nothing to do with you or your client. Mr. Gray would like a meeting. Anything I have to say I'll say at his parole hearing. Well, if you have a change of heart you know where you can reach me. I won't. And if you contact me again, I'll file harassment charges. Hold it. Keep still! Stop moving, bitch! No, please! How many guys do you figure over the years you've had put away? Muggers, kidnappers, rapists, murderers couple dozen I bet. Yeah, and I was really glad to do it, all right. It was my way of offering more to the world, than just overpriced furniture. But it's starting to cost me too much, Nick. I mean this guy, attacks another woman. What's that gonna cost? Don't lay that off on me. Sarah, this girl, Meredith McRaney, she got a clear look at this guy's face. I need the best. Now... you started the drawing, finish it for me. Fine, this is it, Nick. This is the last time. Normal distance apart. The lids maybe angled down a little bit. That's pretty much for the eyes. Shouldn't I be concentrating on the whole face. No, it's better if you've done eyes for details 'cause I need them. Pretty gutsy how you handled that guy. I come from a family of five brothers. I don't take crap from anyone. -So, how tall are you Meredith? -Five-nine in heels. Five-seven without. So, when you were facing him, you're eyes came up to where? His forehead. So, that would make him about... Five-seven. We had a guess. Okay, yeah, yeah, I see how this works now. You have a cool job. Working in an office, it sucks. All right, it's time for you to take a look. Wow, that's really in the ball-park. Okay. A little less heavy on the eyebrows. Yeah. Maybe a little less droopy on the eyes. W... wider through the mouth. Make some lines on the forehead. I-I think his nose was narrower than that. Even more narrower than that. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm positive. This is really close... Maybe a little less of the curve on the jawline. That doesn't feel right. Who are we drawing? The guy that I saw right? A less of a curve. Don't really lead you through the end but... It's definitely him. -Hello. - Hey Sarah, it's me. Sorry I missed you earlier. Did you get the sketch? Yeah, I, put it in your inbox when I couldn't find you. You kidding. I just picked up my inbox it wasn't there. Listen will you do me favor, do up another one as soon as you can, I'll pick it up. Nick, I can't. You know, it just takes too much out of me. And, besides I promised Michael that I wouldn't. I'm sorry. Michael where were you last night? Before you came home. At the office, as always. Doing what? Same thing I'm doing right now. Trying to keep my-my story straight. You know, for the Senate committee thing. I'm being, pretty good sport about the interrogation, don't you think? So, you were at the office around 8:30. At 8:30, I, I take a run. You know that. I work till eight and then take a run. Clear my mind, then... Did anyone see you? I mean, someone must have seen you. Um, what's going on? Another woman was attacked and I did a composite for Nick. I thought we agreed that you were done. That's certainly what you were pushing for, wasn't it? Is that why? This a joke, right? Sarah, what are you thinking? Look at him, Michael. What? So, you assume it's me? I'm drawing and the face is becoming more and more familiar. What would you think? I would think that it's a coincidence. That it's someone who resembles me. Anything but what you're assuming. That's more than just a resemblance. No, it's not. Not unless you think that I could do what this man has done. Not the Michael that I know. What other Michael is there? We all have secrets. I don't. Not from you. This is bull. You're afraid of me. I can feel it. I think I'll take the couch. That way we'll both sleep a little easier. Goodbye Mr. Reynolds. Good morning. Hi, Irena. Hey, Mrs. Reynolds it's only, how you say, "A bump in the road." This is key to showing the statistical foundation for our rate structure. You with me, Mike. Focus here, pal. Keep your eyes on the price. Yeah, which is, everything the firm's asked is always paper. -Mike -Relax, Ted, okay. When it's time to testify I'll know these figures and I will do my best to confuse the committee. Mike, we're not exactly alone here. I don't give a damn, I don't. You. Listen Joe, I don't care... Bag it, tag it and get it off to forensics, all right? If that's the reason you think Michael's... We found Meredith's shoes... and Polaroid those photographs in Michael's closet. You don't need to look at those Sarah. This isn't what it looks like. It can't be. I am so very sorry. I wanted to close this case but sure as hell not like this. Where's Michael? Sarah, thank god.... You gotta get me out of here. They filed charges, Michael, for murder. The arraignment's tomorrow. Murder? Who's murder? The man who attacked Meredith McRaney also killed Dana Pennington. Both women worked in your building. Well, so do 300 other people. The police found things, in our house. What things? What things, Sarah? The attacker's clothes, murder shoes, photos. I-I-I don't know what you're talking about. They were in your closet. -Their not mine. -So, how did they get there? I don't know! Are you buying into this? I can't explain the things I've seen. What does that mean? -What the hell does that mean? -You're scaring me. You're scaring me! I didn't do this! Sarah. Sarah, I didn't kill anybody. I didn't attack anyone. You gotta believe me. Psst. White bread. You like men? No. You will when I'm done. Talk to me. I said, "Talk." A-about what? Your body. Your body white bread. Give me details. Start talking or I'm gonna come down after you. Um. I'm six foot... I-I have blond hair. What about the chest? Yeah, broad. Any hair? -What? -Any hair? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I love a hairy chest. I love hairy men. I'm just messing with you. I'm Ernesto. Hey. Got you. Mr. McCain. How could you loose that bail hearing? The bail hearing is just a battle, Mrs. Reynolds. The trial is the war and I intent to win it. My team and I are already preparing our strategy. And, does that involve looking into other possible suspects? Not necessary. We must simply establish reasonable doubt. And rest assured we will do exactly that. Um... Do you think that he is innocent? Madam, you hired me because of my acquittal record. My goal is to give you what you want. Six feet, Meredith said five-seven. Don't laugh, don't cry, don't show nobody nothing. Yo man, you too close to me. Following me like a freaking puppy dog. -Sorry. -Don't use that word, it's weak. It's due what they got. It's gonna be hard to picture. Anyways you'll be protected. Meantime, be invisible. But, when trouble comes you never back down. What do you mean, trouble? Some guy's up to bash you up. What guy? Why? Better hope it's not him. I can hear you in there. And, I'm coming in. Where's Henry? Who are you? Um, Henry's not here. I'm his parole officer. I'm Kip. So, um, you and Henry are friends? Henry is my best friend. Henry's got him this... itty-bitty camera. Sometimes, we make movies, and watch them after on TV. He's kind of dumb, like me. So, um, Kip is it okay if I asked you some questions about Henry? Is Henry in trouble? I know he done bad things. Things with ladies. Has he done bad things lately? Is your coffee okay? Yeah. It's great, thanks. Um... Did you see Henry come in last Tuesday night? Today is, Saturday? One more. Tuesday. Did I see him? Probably would have been around 8:30 at night. He might have been wearing a black sweat suit. I don't know. I forget, stuff. Henry's gone. Ain't he? Yeah, he is. I'm sorry. Maybe the pretty lady took him. What pretty lady? She'd come to visit him sometimes. Okay, how about we play a game. Okay, you... tell me what she looked like and I'll draw a picture of her, okay? Thank you. I've never seen her before. Well, maybe she wasn't involved but I think Henry Coleman was. Sarah, you... Why would anyone want to frame me? You know, I-I it doesn't make sense to me. I don't know, but, um... I'm sorry, Michael, sorry that I doubted you. Well, just knowing that you're on my side now, it's all that matters. I'm gonna get you out. Okay, I'm taking this to Nick. You got nothing here, Sarah. All right just look at Henry Coleman's picture, Nick. All right, he-he could be Michael's brother. I think that he's the one... Sarah, we searched Coleman's apartment. There is nothing. There is nothing that links this man to the crimes. Michael is innocent. This isn't what it appears to be. We found the evidence in your house. Look, your loyal I get that. I feel for you, I really do. But you're grabbing at straws here. Sarah, my door is always open to you as a friend. But it is closed for every desperate crazy ass theory. Now, we both know, who the perp is. Yes. Yes, hello, this is Margaret calling from credit card services. A Henry Coleman has applied for a visa card and I was wondering, if you could confirm his employment status for us please. Let me check. He's a handyman at a place called "The Edge." Thank you. So, your lady, she got herself some pretty movies? Hey, she's my wife. Let's not talk about her like she's some bimbo. Hey, chill out, okay. Little too tightly wound. People are watching me, Ernesto. I, I can feel it, you know. Eyes on me. People are watching me. You need to hook up, man. What do mean, hook up? You know, with a gang, for protection, man. I could spot you. You gotta be kidding me. I don't wanna hook up with anybody. I wanna get outta here. I'm hearing things, man. What, what kind of things? Things. Just watch your back tomorrow, that's all. Powerful, isn't it? Chad Sharpe, I run the place. I've seen this before. Art in America, maybe. They just did a feature. You wanna get in the ground floor now's the time. So, who is Lazarus? He likes to keep that a secret. If anything it builds up the buzz. I sold almost every piece. This one's still available. If you're interested in a purchase. Look, okay, I'm not here to bother anybody, all right. Hello, Sarah. Thank you for coming. Please have a seat. You look well. That's a lovely locket. Is that a gift from your husband? I'm not here to talk about that. No, I suppose not. Sarah, you know that I never tried to contact you. That we've never... spoken about what occurred. What you did, you mean. Of course. I can't excuse my conduct but I can explain it. I can apologize for it. And I'd like to do that now if I may. Not if that makes you feel better. Nothing can that. Thank you. I'll spare you the melodrama of my childhood. Sufficing to say that growing up as award of the State was no... Norman Rockwell material. I never knew my mother. That's what drew me to your paintings. Your mother and child series. To me... they were images of the nurturing I never received. I watched you work, for days, weeks. And I came to believe that I had to make you mine, one way or another. Sarah, I regret what I did to you, more than I can ever say. I can have compassion for the child. But I can't forgive the man. Well, I suppose I didn't expect you to. But since my hearing is tomorrow, I... I wanted to see what I've become. I-I've finished several violent defenders programs. I... I've earned a degree in art and literature. And I teach the other inmates. E-excuse me are you asking me to testify on your behalf? I-I only ask that you hear me out. I don't need to. I saw your paintings. You're Lazarus. Seemed a fitting pseudo name for someone who's been reborn. Right, but that wouldn't be you, would it. Do you know what your paintings tell me? That you are now exactly who you were then. I won't testify for you. Not now, not ever. I'd hoped to settle this pleasantly. It's strange isn't it, how I've become an artist? It's almost as if the gift passed from you to me. Ten years isn't enough time for what you did to me. Neither is 20 and it's exactly I would tell the parole board. If you try to keep me in here your husband will pay the price. What do you mean by that? The system's my world, Sarah and Michael's in it. If you testify against me or go to the authorities, he'll die. And before he dies I'll make him suffer in ways you can't possibly imagine. -You can't do that. -Of course, I can. But don't take my word for it. Go and see him. His nose is broken and I made it happen. So, what happens if I speak on your behalf? He'll be unharmed, you have my word. And suppose I testify for you and the board, still turns you down. Make believers of them, Sarah. I'm counting on you. So, is Michael. You used Henry Coleman to frame him, didn't you? I'll see you at the hearing tomorrow, Sarah. You still are very, very pretty. My God, look at you. It's nothing, um. Just had the doctor take out that bump. You know, I never liked that bump anyway, so. Why didn't you ever tell me about Gray? I wanted to leave it in the past. You know, for the first couple of years I slept with a gun under my pillow. And after that I just never looked back. So, many things make sense now. I'm sorry I never told you. All this time I've been living in a shadow. And, now we both are. When's the hearing? Tomorrow morning, 9:45. Okay. Don't do it, Sarah. Okay. Don't testify for him. -Michael. -I can take care of myself. I-I it doesn't like it, but... I can't loose you. Don't let him out after what he did to you. I want you to promise me. Okay? Promise me, damn it. Sarah I'm really glad that you are here. It's gonna make all of the difference. Gray... The guy's coming off like Gandhi in there. I almost get the feeling that the board is leaning in his direction. Mrs. Reynolds. Knock'em dead. Thanks for coming, Mrs. Reynolds. Sorry to keep you waiting. This board would like to hear your testimony to aid us into deciding the matter of Mr. Gray's parole. The floor's yours. I was a student leaving class, at night. And... Mr. Gray attacked me with a knife. He didn't look calm and normal like he does now. And he left me with scars that I still carry. But recently I met with Mr. Gray, and... we talked about his rehabilitation among other things and... After meeting with him I must tell the board, that I really believe that he's a changed man. Hello. You did the right thing, Sarah. How did you get this number? I know you've been talking to Sousa, Sarah. And I want you understand that as long as you don't venture where you shouldn't I'll keep my side of the bargain. That's not enough, my husband is still in jail. I doubt he will be for long. He'll go to trial with advantages, I never had. Money is status. -Find a lawyer. -Innocence. Everyone will get what's coming to them. Be seeing you, Sarah. No, you won't. That's an ice breaker. Drive. Flowers. They're not from me. You let Gray walk. Please tell me why because I gotta hear it from you. Nick it isn't what it looks like. "It's not what it look likes", is that your motto these days. You say, Mike is innocent and we got him dead to rights. You take a guy who almost kills you and you put him out for sainthood. I can't explain it. Well, I think I can. Sarah, I've talked to a couple of shrink friends of mine, and they think that, it's possible, what Gray did to you ten years ago, has left you seriously bent. And, maybe, maybe, you know what Michael did to those girls, and maybe it's some sick game between the two of you. Get out of here. -Sarah, I don't know who the hell you are anymore! -Get out of here! As the owner of The Edge, it has been my privilege to represent Lazarus. The artist who's powerful work has taken the art world by storm. His true identity has been the subject of endless rumor and speculation. Here to set the record straight, is the artist himself. Theodore Gray. I don't have a prepared statement but I'm glad to answer any questions you might have. - How did... - Is it true you spent time in prison? Prison gave me the chance to change my life. I'm living breathing testament to the possibilities of rehabilitation. - The question here... - How does that square... with the fact the themes of alienation, despair even violence, so pervade your work. I think the point is that I now rule, the impulses that once ruled me. Now, I express them artistically as opposed to... Theloniously. Thank you. Have you ever killed anyone? Now, if I say, "yes," I'll get in trouble. But if I say, "No", you'll be disappointed. I'm a star. All I needed was a chance to shine. I'm doing the morning show circuit next week. I'll have to catch it in LA. I'm heading out. I need a fresh start. A woman like you could go very farther. From what I hear it's my kind of town. Be nice to leave with a biggest egg, though. We agreed on a price. Hey. Someone's been calling, a Mrs. Lieber. I know you're not interested in taking on any new clients right now and I told her that. But she told me tell you that Lazarus referred her. Isn't he that new weird artist guy? Mrs. Lieber. Libre. It's French for free. I thought it was rather clever. For you. Sort of a peace offering, I do hope you take it. No, thanks. I find your rejection profusely satisfying, Sarah. Well, there's certainly more where that came from. I understand. For years I hated you too. Then I realized, all the changes that had happened to me, all the good things coming my way, I owe them all to you, Sarah. Well, I'm certainly glad that I could contribute to your personal growth. I wanna put the past behind us. You can't. Neither can I. Don't say that. All the money, the success even my freedom, these things can't bring me happiness. But you can, Sarah. With Michael out of the way the two of us. Is that what you think? There's nothing you'd want that I couldn't give you. Do you have any idea how much I hate you? I hated you too but look at me now. Sarah, you'll forget all about Michael, I promise. I could help you. -One phone call. -Don't. Part of you feels like I do. There's no part of me that feels like you do. I have reservation at the Bijou for eight. I'll wait for you, Sarah. But I won't wait forever. What do I do next time Griswald comes after me? Did you try standing still? Okay, don't wear no shirt, makes you hard to grab. You go at his eyes, he's way worse, whatever. 'Cause that's what he's gonna do. I like you asking me stuff. Outside you got your big job, your big house. But in here, I'm like a God to you, man. Outside I'm just a Cholo boosting your car. Irena. Irena. You gave me heart attack. Okay, you can't leave the door open like that. I-I bringing you air. Irena, remember when you came in and Michael had slept on the couch. Did anybody come to the house that day. Try to remember. Okay, did you see anything unusual, anybody? Nah, w-ait. I take trash, I see woman, she walk by. I see before, maybe she live in neighborhood. Okay, um... Did she look like this? I think. But hair was different. Right. Hey, where's Ernesto? They moved him. Where to? Presidential suite, how the hell should I know. You look radiant. I shouldn't have come. Why did you then? Maybe that's what I wanna find out. Being apart from Michael, um... I don't know the whole thing just seems so confusing. Confusing in what respect. I guess I just sort of feel... Relieved? Our marriage wasn't perfect. I mean, isn't. You know, I really shouldn't be telling you any of this. I've every reason not to. Sarah, I'm going to do my very best to win your faith. I've given oil to my lawyer in lieu of his fee collect a friend of his sort, the rest is history. You planned it all so perfectly. When you have nothing but time anything is possible. I'm not talking about your art career. Neither am I. So, Henry Coleman owed you, because you got him a job at the gallery. Sarah, let's try to look forward not back. Well, I'm just intrigued by how you think. There must have been a woman involved. What makes you say so? Well, with a man like you, there's always a woman. Is she still in the picture? We've parted ways. When did you think of framing Michael? Sarah, please. This is your idea of winning my faith. Why do have to know? Make me a part of it? Two years ago. I saw your wedding photo in the newspaper. Michael bore a striking resemblance to a fellow inmate. It got me thinking. Thank you. We've just passed the point of no return, Sarah. Are you ready to go where that takes us? Yes. It's always been you, Sarah. Could you excuse me I just need to freshen up. Damn. Everything all right, Sarah. Tell me that's not what you were doing. With regard to marble flooring, materials... Dictation for work. Assuming it was anything else shows how little you think of me. -Sarah. -You know, I come here, after what you did and you have the nerve not to trust me? Sarah, please don't let a simple misunderstanding... This was not how I'd hoped the evening would end. Lovely Yvette is leaving us folks. So, what better time to show some love for all that unique talent. You'll be begging for more. Please welcome sexy, sultry. Kendra. You know who I am, don't you? You're in my way, I know that much. You planted evidence. Your best chance is to turn yourself in. You mix me up with someone else. You really think that Gray is just gonna let you walk away? Men let me do whatever I want. Trick is, always hold something back. My husband is in jail because of you. Now, you're gonna help me get him out. I got places to go. Come on, boy, you're moving. Damn. Meet your new bunk mate. What you waiting for? A sign. My God. Well, I was gonna write something down. But... I can hardly spell. Take too long anyway. So, dressed myself up like a... jogger, followed this girl. I was just supposed to ruff her up, take some pictures. So, when I dropped her into the bushes, you know, I just... I got, like I always get. Well, she's dead. Look what I've done. Look what I've done. So, anyway, Gray was mad. He was mad and he made me do another girl. Devil inside me has woke up again. Won't let me be. The same as I always was. I just can't have that. Freeze, hands in the air! Okay, just wait a second. Guys, put them down, put them down. Before you say one word, just let me inform you that we got a tip that this woman's life was in danger, from you. Okay, Gray made that call. Okay, he killed her and he's going to kill Michael... Sarah, this does not look good. Nick, I am not lying. Gray framed Michael. It's all on that tape. I'm taking you downtown for questioning. Nick you're just waiting time. Okay, please do not do this. Michael will die. I'm taking you downtown for questioning. Nick, I'm telling you the truth. Okay, just watch the tape, please. Nighty-night, boys. What the...! Shit. Sarah. It's over. -Gray? -The pager message, it was routed to a cell tower near Logan airport. We grabbed his sorry ass trying to board a flight to Mexico city. Okay, so what happens to him now? He'll be processed and he'll be sent back to prison, for a long, long time. Sarah, I... What can I say? You couldn't have known, Nick. Yeah, well... I'll be second guessing myself for a long, long time on this one. Here's my... cue to make a very discreet exit. Take it easy. -Hey. -Hi. Huff. Come on buddy, let's go. I can't get close enough to you. I dreamed about this, you know. That's what it kept me going. You know... I love you, Michael. And not, the way I did, you know. It's like I'm finally with you. How'd you like to be with me somewhere warmer? Let's go away. Yes, but I think we should leave right now. 'Cause, God, don't we deserve a vacation? Hey. What difference does it make what time of the day she calls? All the difference. Before noon, means she's really into you. So, according to your system it's really bad 'cause she only called me back around 5:30. Man, what's wrong with him? I think he's having a heart attack. Dispatch this squad A6 we have a suspect in need of medical attention. We're traveling south on Center approaching third. Confirmed. Sending paramedics. Dispatch this squad A6, can we have an ETA on the paramedics please. Should be there in about two minutes. Man, he's not breathing. What the... Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Dispatch, dispatch, 1078, officer in distress. Jesus! -Hi, you've reached Michael and Sarah please leave a message. -Come on, come on pick up. Sarah, if you're there please pick up the phone. Gray is on the loose! Sarah, please if you're there pick up the phone. Gray has escaped. Sarah, pick up the phone if you're there. Sarah, pick up the phone, Sarah! See Michael, I can get ready fast when I need to. Michael? Michael. Hello, Sarah. Where's Michael? If you don't tell me where he is I'm gonna blow you're head off. Sarah. Why don't you come up here to the bedroom and have some wine. I know it's your favorite I took it from your home. Michael. Okay, where is he? What have you done to him? You've cost me everything, Sarah. And now you're gonna suffer for it. Watch. No! It's me that you want. You can have me now. I can have you? Sarah. I don't want you anymore.
