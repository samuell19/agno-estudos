This is all your fault. No. What are you doing? What are you doing? - What the f...? - There's a good boy. No. No! What are you... What are those? What the fuck are those? No. No. You left me no choice. No, no, no, no... Fuck! No! Help me! Somebody help me! Somebody help me... Oh, God. Please don't do this. They were fucking kids. They're just fucking kids! We love you, Bobby. You're like a brother to us, Bobby. Okay, why do I sense there's a "but" coming here? But, this is the last time we let you organize us accommodations. What? You don't like nature, huh? You don't like the woods? I like electricity and I like hot water. Didn't have to be so far out, man. There are closer camps. Yeah, we're literally in the middle of nowhere. dude. Okay, look, every hotel within a 30-mile radius was booked up. I mean, everyone's in town to watch the Hyenas demolish the Beavers tomorrow. Big game of football, small town, plus a little impromptu reunion with the nine of us means not a lot of options to suit everyone's bank account. - Okay? - Great. Thanks. Yeah, I don't know. I'm pretty sure I can afford two rooms at the Tiki Motel. People go to the Tiki Motel to get three things: bed bugs, crack, dead. I'd rather share the woods with these vermin than step foot in that shithole. Okay, there's a lot of reasons why this is more advantageous than a hotel. Who says "advantageous"? Uh, she does, bro. We can be as loud as we want. The fire's awesome. And we haven't all been together in a while. Jesus, bro. Classic. - Still such an idiot. - All right. All right. Laugh it up, a-holes. You don't use that shit, you're all going to end up with Zika, Ebola, West Nile or herpes. Uh, relatively certain you can't contract herpes from a mosquito. Yeah, you can. Katie Krewson, my girlfriend junior year, she had it, she gave it to me. I asked her about it, said she got it from a mosquito. I don't think that's how it works, dude. Wait, that's cured now, right? Yeah. Probably. Oh, gross. - Where are you going, babe? - What, I can't take a piss in the woods? Or do I have to get your permission for that too? Somebody put hot sauce in her taco. - What did you do, bro? - More like, who'd you do? You got a reputation, man. That's all I'm saying. Chalk this one up to too many beers, but the last person you want to piss off is Cici, man. That chick is vindictive. You remember... What was that history teacher's name? Mr. Edmunds. Mr. Edmunds, gave Cici detention for texting in class one Friday. So Monday, she comes back, posts on the NAMBLA forums - from his school P.C. - NAMBLA? North American Man-Boy Love Association. Ouch. Oh, poor Mr. Edmunds. Guy gets arrested, put on the sex offender watch list. Wait, seriously? Shit, I wondered what happened to that guy. Fucking loved me. Gave me straight A's all the time. Shea, you're up. Yeah, we all did fucked-up shit in high school. No one here is innocent. Well, you know what I say? Fuck the past! - Yeah, fuck it. - Whoo! I'm just happy to be here right now. Boo! Amber, you scared me. Sorry. So you know I can read you like a book, right? Okay, well, I don't read books, but I can read you like a celebrity gossip blog. What did he do now? Want to talk? I think he's cheating on me. Okay. Well, if he is, then you need to be Amber Heard to his Johnny Depp and leave Ezra's sorry ass. I know. I just... I kind of like making him fight for it. Watching him squirm. You are such a bitch. No wonder we're besties. Hey, Erin. Oh, thanks. You seem quieter than usual. I'm fine. Just seeing everyone back together... takes me back to high school. Wasn't exactly the happiest time for me. I'm sorry. No, I... I don't want this weekend to be about Caleb. I want it to be about having fun. Remember when we played Truth or Dare, and when it was her turn, you dared her to go home. Oh, shit. I'm just glad to see you're not acting weird around Erin anymore. High school was a long time ago. My taste in woman has changed... ...for the worse. Dick. I like a girl I can argue with, and then have explosive makeup sex with later. Besides, Erin's been mute ever since, you know. Well, with what she's been through, Kato, maybe you should just cut her some slack. I mean, she was like that before. Need any help here, bro? No, thanks. I've seen too many rock stars go down that road. You remember my band, right? Dick Cancer. Cock Tumor. We changed our name after college. Our sound had matured, so it made sense that we mature with it, you know? Go by Butthole Equinox now. Played Gato Loco last week, Wednesday. Place was packed. It was also half-off frozen margarita night, so it's tough to say what the big pull was. I sent you a link on Facebook though, didn't I? I can make sure you're added to the list. Don't bother, bro. I blocked you. Ow. Fuck. To old times? Yeah. Cheers. I did not think you'd come. I mean, this isn't exactly your kind of jam, roughing it. Falling asleep under the stars. Oh, fuck the stars. You should see the fairy lights in my tent. Normally I'm a "bros before hos" kind of guy, but this one time I got to cross the party line and ask, what the hell do you see in that guy? I mean, dead-end rock band. Dopey smile. You know, you were valedictorian. Now you're graduating from M.I.T. I ain't no genius, but that shit don't compute. Weren't you, like, a huge drug dealer in college? I grew out of it. I had the good sense to identify a bad habit and drop it. I need a refill. Your drink's almost full. No, it's not. Dickhead. ♪ I'm feeling lonely ♪ Something you want to say? Good night, Oregon! Hey, when are you opening for Coldplay? Fuck this. Jesus. Can't tell if they're fucking or performing an exorcism. No, I'm going to blow. I'm going to blow. Almost there, Bobby. Almost there. What the fuck, Bobby? Come on, Cici. I told you, nothing happened. Trust me, okay? What's the point of us being out here if you're going to treat me this way, huh? Fine. Fuck. Whatever. All right, rock star, are you ready for something different? - Those real? - They're my dad's. That is disgusting. That is gross. Oh, no. They're my dad's department-issued cuffs. - Oh. - So they're legit. Let's get kinky. Ow, ow, ow ow. Got caught on my skin. Oh, I am sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Oh, ow. - I'm sorry. I was trying to be cool. How many times do I have to tell you, I'm the cool one in this relationship. I'm the rock star. You're the smart one. Never forget that. Now get over here. What? Nothing. Come on, say it. You seem really happy. I'm just really excited for tomorrow. Since when do you care about football? So how about by the time we're 35, we get married. What? Um, let's... Let's make it 40, okay? Done deal. Hey, good work tonight. Jesus, I... I got to go. Hold on. I'm fucking starving. Fuck. Oh, shit. Turn the fuck around, Erin. Don't look at me. Get down! Don't you fucking look at me. Are you alone? - Speak up. - Yes. Is everyone sleeping, hmm? I think so. Has anybody seen me? No. Okay, good. That's good. Okay. Turn around. Please, let me go. I haven't seen your face. Shut your eyes. You don't have to do this. Please. Close your eyes. - Please. - I'm so sorry. Rian. Rian, wake up. Rian. What's going on? I don't know. We were gassed. What the hell are these? I have no fucking idea. Babe? Kato, are you...? Oh, my fucking God! What's going on here? Our cars. They're gone. Just... Just calm down. He won't wake up! Bobby! Where the fuck are you? Shut the fuck up. What the fuck is going on? Jesus, you're all so annoying. Mr. Peterson? Rian. It's so good to see you again, though I do wish it was under better circumstances. - My head hurts. - That's from the halothane. What is that? - Sleeping gas. - Fuck. It's been a long time since I taught all of you. Tonight's your final lesson. - This isn't funny! - Don't. Don't. It's not supposed to be funny. Where the fuck is Bobby, you fucking weirdo? - Cut this shit off. - Don't you worry about Bobby. You'll hear from him soon enough. Paul... that's not coming off, trust me. That's industrial-grade cabling. Save your energy. You're going to need it for later. What the fuck is going on? Get back! Get the fuck back! All right! All right, just put it down. We can talk, man. Whatever's going on, we can talk. Please, man. You've all gone on with your lives. Moved on as if nothing ever happened. Reckless? Yes. Entitled? Most definitely. Desensitized. That's what all of you are. Erin... ...I'm so sorry to drag you into this. You were always such a sweet girl. But I can't leave anyone out of this. Is this about Caleb? No. This is about all of you. We all graduated high school, man. We don't need your science class problem-solving bullshit. What the hell is this about? Tonight, you're going to find out just how good of friends you really are. - What is that? - What is that? What the fuck? What the fuck is this? Is this like, laser tag? I watched my son die. And I watched my wife dose herself into suicide. He's crazy. Time with my family was... Was taken from me. Time. Only once it's been stolen from you can you truly appreciate what a precious resource it really is. So precious, in fact, that only one of you will leave these woods alive tonight. - The one... - What the fuck? ...with the most time. What the fuck? No! What the fuck? Holy shit! Oh! Fucking hard core! Rian, what are you doing? Get back. You're going to get brains all over yourself. See this? This is why I was never allowed to sleep over at Caleb's house. Why would he do that? Why would he do that in front of us? He was always fucking weird. - Just like his kid. - Found our phones. So call the fucking cops, brainiac. Good luck with that. Fuck, the one time I don't get insurance. Guys... they're timers. And they're set. This sucks. I don't like this. Now I know I had too much to drink, because I'm in the middle of a dream where my high school science teacher stitched my ass into a metal vest, downloaded all the "Saw" movies, bitched about millennials for a hot second, then blew his fucking brains out. Well, look, they're green. Green's a positive, happy color, right? Hey, Shea's got a blue one. I want a blue one. Because she's got the most time. What the fuck does that mean, Miss M.I.T.? - We can figure this out. - Will we, Erin? What do you think happens when that timer hits zero, Erin? Generally speaking, unless I'm fucking watching a rocket launch or heating up a burrito in a fucking microwave, countdown timers are a bad fucking thing! Get this thing off of me. Peterson said it was pointless. I don't care, just get it off. Okay. Um... I think I know a way how, but I'd have to chop off your arms and your head to do it. - Shut up, PJ. - No, he's fucking right. These things are airtight. Where the fuck is Bobby? The last thing we need is Bobby. And why the fuck not, Miss Know-It-All? Bobby sold us out. He worked with Peterson to get us here. No. Think about it, Shea. How does one man transport all of our cars out of the woods alone, gas us all? - He doesn't. Bobby helped him! - No, Bobby would never do that. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm fucking sure. It was mysteriously Bobby's idea to come here in the first place. Bobby knew a place we could stay for free. Bobby and Mr. Peterson made a deal to trap us out here for whatever crazy, messed-up game this is. Where is he? We don't need Bobby. What we need is a car! Fuck. Okay. Okay, all right. Mr. Peterson didn't drive the last car out of here and then walk back. There has to be a car around here somewhere. We need to find it and get back to civilization. All right, let's fucking move then. Go. Go. Go! Come, PJ. Let's go up this way. Amber, pass the flashlight. Yo, Cici? Let's check back here. I think I'm going to go with my friends. Let's go, Kato. Just yell if you see anything! No shit, Sherlock. This is the worst reunion ever! Shit. Something's not right. The longer we wait, the worse it's gonna get. Has anyone seen anything? They've got to be close, guys. Shea, come on. Oh. Oh, fucking come on. There's nothing here. Why would Peterson do this? We all know why he's doing it. Just don't exactly know what he's done. There's fuck-all out here! Bobby? Guys! Hey, guys, come here! Over here! This way! Guys, come quick! We better get some fucking answers. Shea, come on. Amber, hurry up. Kato, wait. - We're here! - My God, Bobby, are you okay? Get the fucking crowbar! Break this fucking lock. Why is there a fucking crowbar there, Bobby? Please, just hurry, okay? Jesus! - What are you doing? - I'm going to get Bobby out. What the fuck, Shea? Bobby's obviously working with Peterson. He helped get us here. Why would you let him out? We just found him chained to a tree with the shit kicked out of him, Rian. That doesn't exactly scream "accomplice" to me. Help, please! You're being crazy, Shea. You need to think. It's a very basic situation. Bobby is not on our side. Fuck! Okay. Okay. He made me do it! He made me do it. Just please, just-just-just get me out of this and I'll explain everything, okay? How exactly does someone make another person drag eight of their friends out into the woods to watch his suicide? Like I said, if I were to posit... Posit? Fucking posit? Words like that are why people fucking hate you. - People hate me? - Yeah. I fucking hate you. Yeah, go do algebra somewhere. Whoa, let's take it easy, guys. Shut the fuck up. He was willingly helping Mr. Peterson. There is no other feasible explanation. So we just leave him chained to a fucking tree? Um... I'm gay. - Are you serious? - What? Okay? I'm... I'm gay... every now and again. What do you mean, "You're gay every now and then," Bobby? Like, part-time gay? I'm bi. I'm bisexual. Thank God I didn't share a fucking tent with him. - Fuck you, Ezra! - No, fuck you, Bobby! Fuck you, man! - No fucking thank you! - Peterson knew! I confided in him in high school. And now that sick fuck took photos of me at some club one month ago, and he... He threatened to release the pictures. It would ruin my life. Unless I dragged all you guys out here. Okay? And I did not know that anything fucked up was going on until he showed up with a gun. He said that he wanted closure for Caleb's death. He wanted to reminisce about old memories, or some bullshit. He knocked me out while he was gassing our tents. He's the one who beat the shit out of me, okay? - What a fucking homophobe. - Seriously, Kato? My job is everything to me. Okay? Like, the only reason I'm doing so well at work is because my boss, Mrs. Rowe, she wants to fuck me, okay? - Gross, dude. - She's not gonna want to fuck me now, so here we are. And I'm sorry, but I didn't know anyone was going to get hurt. What happens when these timers hit zero, huh? - Just take it easy. - What do you mean, "get hurt?" Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. He didn't tell you the rules? What rules, Bobby? Let's just take it down, okay? Just let me out and I'll explain everything. It's really simple, actually. Come on, baby, yeah. Come on, please, please, please. - What the fuck? - Come on, guys. What are we supposed to do here? He's our friend. Yeah, thank you, guys. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Okay, yeah. - Watch your feet. - In the back. Oh, my God! Yeah! Yes. Thank you. Thank you. At least some of you have fucking souls. He has something behind his back. Bobby, why have you got a fucking knife? What are you doing, Bobby? He gave this to me, okay? Because I've got the least amount of time. And now I am going to stab that piece of shit right there. Get over here, Kato! Aah! - Whoa! - What the fuck, Bobby? We're your friends. Why are you doing this? Oh, please! Seriously. Why do you think any of us ever hang out, huh? Huh? It's because of Caleb. And he is gone. So don't you tell me that we are fucking friends. We are not fucking friends! Bobby, you're out of time. Oh, fuck me in my asshole. I'm sorry! Amber, here, come on. Rian. Oh, God. - Here, take my hand. - I don't want your help, Ezra. No, no, guys, guys! Guys, stop! PJ, where are you? Guys, you got to come back! Rian... - Cici, wait up. - Leave me alone, Ezra. - Just talk to me. - You want to talk? Let's talk. She's here tonight, isn't she? - The girl you're sleeping with. - I don't know what to tell you. I didn't cheat on you. I would never hurt you. Come on, Cici, what do I have to do to prove myself to you? We're in the middle of the fucking woods with bombs strapped to our fucking chests. I am asking you to trust me. You're a cheat! You use women and you discard them. And when you're done with them, that's all you ever say. "Trust me. You can trust me." People that you can actually trust don't have to convince you of it all the time. Okay, this night is already so fucked up. Can we just... just figure out how to get out of here? Then we can talk, we can do whatever. Let's just get out of here first, please, babe. You've got 30 minutes. I've got 40. Let's use this time to figure this out. Come on, babe, please. I wish I had more time. We all do. So I can watch you die in front of me. Fuck. Fuck me. What the fuck do we do? I don't know. Doesn't look like we got a lot of choice. Peterson said the only one to get out of here alive is the one with the most amount of time. That's Shea. But why her? Whose dick did she suck to get more time? Why the fuck would Bobby act like that? Guy was a closet gay. Maybe he was just very, very frustrated. Look on the bright side. At least now we know what happens when these timers hit zero. Wait, that doesn't seem fair. So the rest of us have got to wait to blow up? Kato, who's next? Who's got the least amount of time? - Guys, where are you? - Oh, shit. Guys? Guys, where are you? Stay green. Stay green. Stay green! Shit! Rian! Oh, fucking Bobby. That's not going to heal. Oh, gross. Come on. Fuck. Oh, shit. Where are you guys? Where the fuck are you guys? Rian? Rian? Rian, I'm sorry. I don't know what to do. I'm about to blow up, babe. I want the green lights to come back. What do I do? Tell me what to do. - I don't know! I don't know! - You don't know? You got to know what to do. You always know what to do. - Say something clever. - I'm sorry, PJ. I don't know what to do. I'm sorry! I don't want to die. Please. Please, no, you got to get away from me. No, PJ, no. No, I can't be around you. No, get away from me! I don't want you to be around me when this thing goes off. Hey, guys. That's a lot of blood. That wasn't an explosion. Well, then, what happened? Come on. What the fuck have I done? Oh, fuck. She came out of nowhere. - Rian, you got to believe me. - No, no, no, no. Shea. Oh, fuck. Oh, no. She's dead. I didn't... I didn't see her come up behind me. Don't do this to yourself. - She's dead. Fucking dead. - Stop right now. Hey! Hey, PJ, we have to get out of here. I... - I can't fucking leave her. - She's dead, PJ! I can't leave her like that. Come on, PJ, we have to find the others. Where are you? - This way. - What was that? They're over there. What the fuck is happening? Holy shitballs, what the fuck just happened? - It's Shea. - We heard a scream. - Was that Shea? - No, that was me. - Are you okay? What happened? - What's going on? Why is there blood on your face, PJ? You run into a tree? - Hey, guys. - Fuck! Even your footsteps are quiet. - Sorry, where's Cici? - What's going on here? She told me to get fucked and ran off. Hey, drummer boy, whose blood is that? Where's Shea, PJ? That's what I'm trying to tell you. Um, she... Something happened to her. What? What the fuck happened, PJ? She's dead. What the fuck did you do to her? It was an accident, man. She came up behind me, I got a fright, I spun around and I hit her right in the head with my flashlight. I hit her so fucking hard, man. - Jesus, dude. - It happened so fast. I'm so fucking sorry, guys. I'm so fucking sorry. Thought I was going to blow up. I thought I was going to die. I'm so sorry. Why does he have more time, now? Oh, fuck, now PJ has more time than me. He's got more time than everyone. He's fucking blue. - Who's got the least? - Oh, shit. You. Guys, we have to find our cars. We don't have time for that. We don't have time for anything. Fuck, we're all going to die. - I don't want to die. - Guys, give me a second. Shea had over 50 minutes left when she died. PJ somehow inherited her time. It makes sense, now. This is what Peterson was getting at, why Bobby had the knife, why he wanted to kill you, Kato. What the fuck are you talking about? We can steal each other's time to stay alive. Shea had 53 minutes left on her timer when she... - When she was... - What, murdered? Man, take it easy. Oh, come on. Fucking say it like it is. PJ inherited her remaining time. But how? Why'd PJ get the time? There must be sensors in here to read... I don't know. Heartbeats, body heat, could be anything. Closest person near someone who dies must get the time. Proximity sensors. Okay, but why would Peterson program the vests to do that? To incentivize us. To incentivize us to do what, exactly? To kill each other The only way to stay alive is to take each other's time. So the more you kill, the more time you get. Seems to be the high-level summary. Why would Peterson do something so evil? The fucker's obviously off his rockers. Thinks we had something to do with his son fucking OD'ing. We were all there that night. That doesn't make any fucking sense. If he was so pissed that his son was dead and we were all alive, then why didn't he just kill us and get it all over with? That's fucking typical Peterson. A convoluted, over-the-top lesson when a bullet to each of our heads would've sufficed. He's the same dickhead teacher he was five years ago. Joke's on him. I mean, no one here is capable of murdering anyone else, right? No, no, no, no, no. Don't try and fucking manipulate me like that. Don't fucking try. No, I'm not going to wait around here and be killed, not after your fucking boyfriend has gone all Lord of the Fucking Flies on one of our friends. Back up, bro. I said it was an accident. And what happens when there's another accident, bro? Just put the crowbar down. No, I think I'm going to hold on to it, thanks. We're dead if we let our emotions rule us. We're all dead, no matter what. Peterson said that only one of us gets to survive. That means whoever has the most time. I.e., your fucking deadbeat boyfriend. Deadbeat? Hey, fuck you. Come on, take it easy. We have to work together. Ask Shea how that worked out for her. Shut the fuck up, Kato. Look, we're either all with each other or... - No. It's every man for himself. - And woman. - Oh, for fuck's sake. - No, shit. You knew exactly what I meant. Now isn't the time to be a bitch. - We need to strategize. - Strategize? You're thinking strategy? - Like, how to kill us all? - I'm thinking how not to die. Pretty soon, everyone here is going to be doing the exact same thing. Some people are getting edgy, trying to get a head start on the game. - Some people are collecting weapons. - Weapons? No, this is a fucking tool, you tool. This is to get this shit off. PJ, we should get out of here. - Okay. - Oh, yeah, of course. Of fucking course, take your blue-vested boyfriend and get the fuck out of here. Protect him from reality like you did back in fucking high school. We can't just sit here and wait this out, Ezra. Time is a precious resource right now, and I'm not going to wait around to try and convince you. It's crazy. We have to try and get help. It's better if we... Oh, for fuck's sake, speak up. - Better if we what? - We're away from each other. So that another... No one else gets hurt. You know, you kept your mouth shut for so long, I really thought you'd come up with something better than that. Hey, no, she's fucking right, dude. No one here knows what they're gonna do when they have 30 seconds left. Dude, in horror movies, when people split up, that's right before they die. Well, yeah, but in horror movies, the fucking bad guy isn't, you know, all the good guys. That's it. We all just go our separate ways. Whoa! Just run, Rian! Fucking psycho! Run, Amber! This is not a situation I'm used to, Kato. Oh, for fuck's sake. Where the fuck are you guys? Wait up, Kato. This thing is heavy. Down here. Come on. We have to get to Route 4 before anyone else does. I think we're safe. Right now, you're the biggest target. If anyone wants to play the game, they'll come after the person with the most time. - So no, PJ, we're not safe. - I'm an endangered species. Look at me. We're not dying here tonight. Not here in these woods like this. - Okay. - Let's go. It's not here. Peterson's gun is missing. What does... What does that mean? It means that someone out here really wants to win already. I don't know if I can do it, I... I don't think I could kill someone, let alone my best friend. Wake up, Amber. You saw how we all scattered like cockroaches the second we faced a flicker of adversity. None of us are really friends anymore. We can't trust anyone. We have to get out of here. And go where? Erin, is that you? Hey, you okay? Get back! You should go and find Cici. She needs you. Cici thinks I cheated on her. She wanted to kill me long before she had a bomb strapped to her chest. No, come on. Wait, please. No, come on, come back. Look... I don't know what's going to happen tonight, okay? But everyone else seems to have their teammates, except us. We were left out. What are you saying? I need you to look out for me? No. I'm saying that you need a partner and I need a partner. You know, someone to... Well, you know... You just want to keep me around because you think I'm an easy kill. Like life insurance for when you've run out of time. Don't think like that, please. I'm not going to be able to do anything when the time comes. Hell, I can even eat gluten. Trust me, I'm not going to be able to kill anyone. Why should I trust you? Your girlfriend doesn't. You don't even know my last name. Erin, come on. We've been in the same group of friends for over five years now, and you know nothing about me. I think this is the longest we've ever spoken. I didn't cheat on Cici, all right? She's paranoid, all right? Now no one can be around someone who's happy to assume the worst of others. You get that, right? I can't be around someone who's looking for permission to kill me. Besides... I have more time than you. So you're going to come after me way before I come after you. And it's Coleman. Your last name is Coleman. Fine. Fine, we're good? - Yeah. - Okay. Let's go. Where, Ezra? To the next camp. Maybe they've got a car. How many people did we pass on the way here? It's like Bobby said. Everyone's in town for the big game tomorrow. We're the only idiots camping out here, and it's at least 30 miles back to town. We won't make it. Well, maybe they got a ranger station or something out here, right? We have to find someone who can help us. Let's just get to the road and we'll figure it out from there. Come on. Come on, Erin. We need to survive long enough until help gets here. How are we going to get help? In an hour we're all forest confetti, and all of our phones are gone. Do you think my dad would let me be away from him for a whole weekend in the deep, dark woods with just one cell phone? I love your dad. Ezra! I'm sorry! I have no fucking idea where to go, do you? Something must have pushed Peterson off the edge. Did he say anything to you? Did you speak to him after the funeral? Why is he fucking with us now? - Okay, where are we looking? - One of the big ones. Come on, baby. Come on. Come on. It's got to be here. Are you sure you packed it? I wouldn't make a stupid mistake like that. It must be here. My dad even handed it to me. He made sure it was charged and everything. - Keep looking, PJ. - Yes. I don't know, maybe Peterson took it. Dickhead thought of everything else. Make sure you check the bottoms. Make sure you check the whole bag. - Here, PJ, try this one. - Yeah, got it. Yeah, come on. Come on. Shit. I got nothing, babe. Stop. Stop. You hear that? I don't want to die alone! We should try and help her, right? Maybe unscrew the vest with my knife. Oh, we can't. What? Rian, she's our friend. - Do you really...? - Shh. Ezra! Where are you? Keep looking, PJ. Okay. Where is it? - Shit. - Shh. Come on. Come on. Come on. What's this? No. Oh. - Stop complaining. - Fuck off. Come on. Fuck off! Doesn't matter. She's gone. - Any service? - Nada. Okay, let's get out of this valley. Yeah. Oh, PJ, come on! Hold on a second. - Oh, yeah. - What the fuck are you doing? If we have it, no one else does, right? Let's just go, please. Were you always like this, so closed off, or is that something that happened after Caleb died? It was my party where he had his heart attack. I tried to revive him, but... Seriously, you're not going to respond to that? Come on, you can't keep all of that bottled up. It's not good for you. To you, Caleb was the quiet smart kid who you maybe copied off of. Are you kidding me? That guy was in Advanced Placement classes. I was, like, one notch above Special Ed. Caleb was my boyfriend, Ezra. He was the first boy I was ever with. And the last. So, yeah, it affected me. You know, there's no shame in talking about it. Or admitting that it changed you. Because it changed me. Watching someone so smart and caring with a future that was so promising... poof, gone in an instant. It flipped a switch in me. Made me realize that there's no points for doing the right thing. People are shit, and they do shitty things, okay? If you're not a user, you're probably being used. You're just as pathetic as me. This loner rebel bullshit routine of yours, so forced and fake. Come on. Erin would probably be the easiest. Wouldn't even cry for help. Yeah, but who deserves it the most? Oh, that goes without saying. Oh, who? I guess I've never really trusted Kato, you know? One time, I saw the guy put ice in milk, Rian. - Ice in milk. - There's still no service. We got to go higher. Oh, fuck. Your psychotic best friend's been here. Cici? You here, babe? I don't like this. Let's get out of here. Hey, weirdo! What are you doing? Back off, Amber! I don't want to hurt you. But I've got to kill him. This is not cool, Cici! This is not how best friends treat each other. No. Why aren't you with Ezra, hmm? It's complicated. It's either you or Amber. I don't want to kill my best friend. We can help you. We can help you find Ezra together, and help you get his time. You should survive. Not him. No, she'll never make it in time. Oh, Jesus Christ, Amber. Seriously? - Rules are rules. I'm sorry. - Wait! - Wait, Ezra was cheating on you. - No. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But he was cheating on you... with Amber. Oh, yeah. Plot twist. - What? - No! He's... He's lying. I would never fuck your boyfriend, Cici. It's true. I went through her phone the other day. They were definitely fucking. They've been texting sweet nothings for weeks. He even sent her a dick pic. Average length. Kind of curved to the left. Terrible, terrible manscaping. I don't know if it's still going on. - Slut. - Last I saw, he accused her of giving him herpes. That's insane! I don't even have herpes! Yeah you do. You got it from me. - Fuck you! - And you gave it to Ezra. And Ezra gave it to me, you bitch! I've been taking pills for months to get rid of this. It's a very, very resilient disease. Come on, you don't want to kill me. Yes, I do. That's the herpes talking. Please! Please! No! I'm pregnant. Please. I'm pregnant, Cici. I'm going to be a mom. Bitch. No, you ain't. - Yeah! - Aah! Oh, shit. I'm so sorry. Oh, my... Amber. What have I done? Amber, I'm so sorry. What do I do? Is it in the ovaries? Are you...? I'm so sorry, Amber. Amber, I'm so sorry! Amber. Amber, I'm so... That is really, really intense. Fuck. Any luck? Yeah. I got two bars. Finally. Whoa. Whoa. - Oh. - That's not a good sign, right? Oh, fuck. - Ezra. - Shit. Someone's dead. I didn't hear an explosion, so... People are playing the game. Oh, fuck me. Time to pop my murder cherry. Cici. Wait. What? You killed her? I did it. I did it. I-I killed my best friend. I took all her time. That is next-level savage. I... I could actually win this thing. You know to win this, you have to kill me, right? We... We've got to do what we can to survive. That's what you did. You... you left me alone with her to get the ax. You set Cici on me. You... It's cool. I know. I don't blame you for what you did. You... you knew I could do it. I just needed a push. The biggest mistake that people are going to make is thinking that they have to wait until someone's in the red to kill. We can jump all of them. We can get the most time. And then we can figure a way out of here. Because there's way too many nice people ignoring the very horrible game that we're being forced to play. So, babe... who do we kill next? He's still not picking up. - Well, try him again. - Okay. Ezra, wait. Did you hear that? - It's coming from here. - It's nothing. Yeah, you're probably right. No. No, I'm not. Grow a fucking backbone, I think you're onto something. - Let's go. - Seriously? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Maybe he's just listening to that Cock Tumor EP I gave him for his birthday three years ago, and he just can't hear the phone. Maybe he's just a really deep sleeper. My dad sleeps with one eye open and the ringer on full blast three feet from his head. Something's not right. I'm going to track his phone. Okay. Okay. And? It's searching. It's zoning in. - PJ, let's go. - What? It says it's 400 yards away over there. Come on! Erin. Erin, be careful. Who's that? Who the fuck is that? Help me. Help me, please. - Holy shit. - Mr. Miller? It's me. It's Erin. Are you okay? Rian? Rian? Is Rian okay? Last we saw, she was in one piece, yeah. Jesus Christ. He got all of you out here? Help me out of this fucking wire. Please, Erin. I don't have a lot of time. Why has Peterson done this? What did we do to him? Peterson is convinced his son's death wasn't natural. That's crazy. Everyone knows Caleb had a heart condition. That's what I told him. So I closed the case. I thought it was over. I thought... I thought we could go on with our lives. But he kept digging. Got his hookups at the university to run more fuck... Fucking blood tests. They discovered that Caleb had a lethal dose of speed in his system, and that's what caused the heart attack. So, what, Caleb had a bum ticker and accidentally did too much molly at my party? How does that justify putting us in these things? Oh, no, no, no, you don't understand. Caleb had five times the lethal dose in his system. Peterson is convinced somebody was slipping it into his drink the entire night. So Caleb was poisoned by someone at my party? You're saying someone in these woods is a cold-blooded murderer? Guys? Oh! - You good? - Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. You hear that? Go. Quick, hide. Who is it? It's Kato. Fuck. We've got to run. Go, go, go, go. Go, run. Go. Go. Go! Guys? Help. - Rian, move. - I'm coming. Guys, come on. We're hurt real bad down here. This is ridiculous. I got to go talk to him. No! Fuck, no. Come on. He's our friend. He's not going to do anything to us. - And besides, he's hurt. - No, no, no, no. It's Kato. He's fucking scared of mosquitoes. I got to try. Babe, please! Kato! I'm coming, bro! I don't want any bullshit trouble, okay? Kato? Kato? Amber? - PJ, buddy, please. - Kato, where are you guys? We got to stick together, man. Kato? Kato. Right here, drummer boy. What the hell, man? You're not even triggered. You're green. Don't hate the player, hate the game. It's perfectly acceptable to hate the player when the player's being a total dick. It doesn't matter what Peterson wants us to do. This nightmare that we've woken up in, we got to find a way out of here and we need to do it quick. Oh, it'll be over quick. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Son of a bitch! No! No! Man, I'm so sorry. I didn't see the leg. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Fuck, man, you've gone all Jason Bateman on me. You mean Patrick Bateman, you idiot. From "American Psycho." Well, then who's Jason Bateman? He's from "Arrested Development." Jeez, you are an idiot, aren't you? Patrick Bateman... Fuck this. Is that all you got, you hippie fuck? What are you doing, Amber? Leave us alone! - There we go. - Kato, please stop. Kato. I've hated you since fucking grade school, you bitch! Aah! I'm going to kill you! Hold still. No, Kato, Kato, Kato. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. Aah! Now that's what I call a drum solo. Ha! PJ! Time to level up. I knew you were a fucking psycho when you didn't cry at the end of "Terminator 2." Almost there, almost there. Mr. Miller, please. Please. We have to get you back to camp. There's a first aid kit there. He's going to need more than a first aid kit. - Let me help you. - Oh, fuck. He's crashing harder than Bitcoin. This is funny. When you kill someone with any other weapon, you're just a regular old murderer. But as soon as you use an ax, you're an ax murderer. Why is that, PJ? Well, if I were to posit... You son of a bitch! Oh! Erin, you're wasting the time you have left. When is doing the right thing a waste of time? You're not gonna be much help to him if you're around him in five minutes. Mr. Miller, where's your phone? - It's in there. - I got it. I've got it. I'll find help, okay? Here piggy, piggy, piggy! 9-1-1. Hello? Oh, thank God. My name's Erin Coleman. No, I can't give you my location. Look, this is an emergency. Please, I need help. Oh, shit. I'm sorry, man. Hello? Get here quick, please. There's blood. Lots of blood. Hello? Fuck. It's dead. Do you know anything about the vests? How to disarm them? The fucker had two controllers or... or detonators, one to tu... One to turn the bombs on, and one to... To turn them off? Yeah. Get those. Find those. He had them on him when he tied me up. - Erin. - Yes? Tell Rian... Tell Rian that I... No! Oh, for fuck's sake. What the fuck are you doing? - Why'd you do that? - He's a dead man. His time was wasting away with him. So you just killed him in cold blood, take his minutes for yourself? You want to take my time too? I didn't take his time. I gave it to you. I made sure you were standing closest to the body. Take it. Take it. It's almost fully loaded. Hold on to it, and only use it if you have to. Do not give it to anyone. Think about numero uno for once. Stand up for yourself. You have the most time now. And a gun. You can survive this. I'm not playing this game, Ezra. I'm going to find Rian. She might be able to save us all. No more bloodshed. Just stop with the wallflower shtick, all right? Make your voice heard. When the time is right... don't be afraid to make a little noise. Where the fuck are you even going? I think I know who killed Caleb. Rian? - Ri-Rian. Rian. - Over here! - Rian. - Oh, babe! - Oh, what happened? - We gotta get out of here, okay? - Okay. Where do we go? - Anywhere. Anywhere is fine. - Okay, okay. - Let's find your dad. Kato! Wait, where are we? I don't know. Didn't we just come from... From here? I-I-I don't know. It all looks the same. You said you... okay. Okay, let's... Oh, shit. Hey, Erin. - Hey. - Hey. So, spoiler alert. Kato and his girlfriend are psychopaths who want everyone dead. - Are you? - No. What happened? He came after us. Went all crazy on PJ. Amber tried to kill me too. You okay? For now. You got more time? Yeah, um... Did you, like, kill...? No, no, of course not. Okay. Thank God. My dad, we were tracking his phone, but it's dead now. We found him, but he wasn't going to make it. What? - Wait, what? - Did-did someone kill him? Where's my father, Erin? Why-why-why is your dad here? Why is he playing this game? Rian, he was bleeding out. He was stabbed, Rian. - Who stabbed him? - Ezra. - Ezra killed my dad? - No, Ezra was there with me. Peterson did. Peterson stabbed him and left him in the woods to bleed out. I was there when he died, Rian. That's why I got his time. I swear, we were trying to help him. I swear. But he told us that Peterson had a detonator that controlled this vest. I've tried it. It doesn't work. It doesn't work! Your dad said he had another one. One that might deactivate them. Okay? - That's good, right? - Where is it, Erin? And I think your dad said it's on Peterson's body, back at the camp. Rian, I'm so sorry. Ri. Ri, we can't give up now. We can't. I'm sorry. It's... it's not giving up, PJ. It's called accepting reality. Maybe you should try to join me for once instead of living in fantasyland all the time! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, it's okay. It's okay. You're okay. Do you want... do you want to go see your dad? No, Rian, please. You don't. Let's figure this out first, and... and then I'll say goodbye if there's time. Yeah, he... he'd expect that, you know, for you to save everybody. What's left of us. Okay. You're not coming with? If Kato's gone nuts, I need to go help Ezra. I'll meet you back at camp, okay? - Okay. Be careful, Erin. - Let's go. This place is going to start sounding like a popcorn machine if this doesn't work. Fucking show yourself! Kato! You fucking dickhead! I'm coming for you, you piece of shit. I know you always hated Caleb. PJ, this way. Hold on. Fuck. We got to keep moving. We're running out of time, PJ. - Just give me two seconds. - Come on. You know that I love you, right? Oh, I love you, too. Okay, I just needed you to know that. There was a time I thought I was going to live forever, and then Caleb died and it was like, I just hope that I outlive my parents. And now... now I'm not even going to outlive fax machines. And, look, I really, really wanted to do this in a better time and place, but it's going to be game over soon, so I might as well do it now. I can't die without asking you a very important question. No, babe. Not now. Let's get out of this, and you can do everything the way you planned, okay? Okay. Just, can you please hold on to this for me, so that I don't lose it? I will, just because I love it. But when everything's back to normal, I want the going down on one knee thing and everything, okay? Yeah. PJ... - Yeah? - ...I was wrong. My favorite thing about you is how you dedicate your life to what you believe in. Your friends, your band, us. Don't change. Okay. Kato! Kato! 'Sup, bro? Got something you want to get off your chest? Like that vest? Or maybe the fact that you fucked my girlfriend with that bushy pencil dick of yours. - Oh, shit, he knows. - It's called manscaping, bro. Read a "G.Q." every once in a while. I know what you did to Caleb. - Fuck this. - Oh, shit. Who gives a fuck about Caleb? His dad, for one. So that's what this is all about. Peterson thinks one of us killed Caleb, and you assume it was me! If the glove fits. You had a hard-on for Erin back in high school, but she was with Caleb. I always did like the quiet ones. I wanted to make them scream. You brought a metric shit-ton of ecstasy to that party. Then made me swear to not say anything to the cops when they came asking questions. You poisoned his drinks, didn't you? That's quite the story, Ez. Didn't you? How am I supposed to have a conversation with you if you won't...? ...give me a minute to spit some words out. I'll give you four. All right. Caleb, he just... You said you'd let me talk. I can't help it. You've just got such a punchable face. Well, we can't all be vapid little pretty boys, now can we? You think you're better than me? Ezra? Ezra. No. Amber? Amber, are you okay? He made me do it. He made me kill my best friend. Look at you, acting all high-and-fucking-mighty. Don't act like you grew a conscience, Ezra. Whether I killed Caleb or not... is irrelevant. You want my time. You're going to kill me no matter what. You're not the hero of this story, Ezra. What choice did I have? Peterson made us all do things we didn't want to do. Look, let's go back to camp. We can figure it out, okay? Rian is figuring out a way to disarm the vests. - Get off me! - Fuck you! Sounds like Erin. I have to kill you. - I got to go save her. - What the fuck, PJ? No. You don't need me for this. You got this, okay? What's the point in surviving tonight if none of our friends do, okay? She could be dead by the time that we deactivate these things. - No, I got to do this. - No, babe. Take this and stab Kato in the fucking face if he comes near you, okay? Be careful. You can end this. You got this. You fucking got this. You know what, man? Just kill me. Just get it over with. No. Fight back. It's fucking weird killing you when you're surrendering. Erin? Fucking mute! Before you kill me, I just want you to know, I didn't kill Caleb. I didn't poison his drinks. I promise. I swear. You bitch. From the moment you got back, all the punching notwithstanding, I knew something had changed. You got weak. Usually it takes months, if not years, for a girl to break a guy down into a spineless, emasculated puddle of a man. Ah, but five minutes with Erin and you got soft. But I'm not soft. I am as hard as a priest in a playground. Erin! Oh, my God! Come on, Ezra. You going to fucking die or blow up? Finally. Still the lowest. Fuck! Even in death you're a selfish dickhead. Stay back, Amber! Don't fucking move! Drop the fucking knife! Seriously? Is this a joke? Put the knife down. What, you're a fucking hero now? Go back to Rian at the camp. Now, run. Yeah, run, you bitch! What, are you going to shoot me, loser? Come on, just fucking do it. - Don't fucking make me. - Fucking do it! Don't fucking make me. Oh, shit, shit, shit. Fuck. Come on, you loser. What are you waiting for? You don't know how to shoot a fucking gun, idiot? Kato. Guys, look, we think we found a way that we can all win this thing, okay? We can all win, Kato. Come on, man. Rian's back at the camp now. We think we found a remote that can deactivate all of us. All right? I need you guys to come with me. Come with me back to camp. Please. I don't want to shoot you, bro. I really, really don't want to shoot you, man. Just, please, you got to trust me. You're my friend. It's Rian, she can save us. How sure is she? I don't know, bro. It's fucking Rian, she knows this shit. What are the odds? Ninety-nine, ninety-nine percent. Ninety-nine? Come on, Kato. Not good enough. Kato! Kato, get off... Son of a bitch, Kato! Kato! Stop right now! Stop! You're like a brother to me, man. Why are you doing this? Oh, what am I doing? What am I doing? Kato. No! Oh, you're right, PJ. Oh, you're right. I'm so sorry. It's okay. It's okay, man. Let's go back to camp. Yeah. I'd like that. Kato! Fuck yes, babe! We're going to win this. That's more like it. Oh, no, no, no, no. Erin's meeting Rian at the camp. They won't be able to stop us, babe. What are you doing? - You know... - Kato? ...I've been meaning to talk to you about that whole "you fucking Ezra" thing. Now seems as good a time as any. What the fuck are you doing? Whatever I have to. I tried to help you, you fucking freak! Help! Somebody help. Thanks for the good time... slut. Oh. Oh. Oh, come on, come on, come on. Please work. Please work. Hey. No fair. No, no, Fuck, no! Oh, shit. Oh, you son of a bitch. Erin, are you okay? What's going on? - We're both red. - What the fuck? PJ didn't find you? Where's PJ? He's with Amber. He's got a gun. He told me to come back for you. - Did you find the remote? - Yeah, but it didn't work. I think everyone's timer has been reset to the lowest score on the board: mine. It was a trick. Peterson thought of everything. - No, you can try again. - No. We can all die right now. I'm sorry. We have to go back for PJ. Oh, shit. Where's PJ? I hope you weren't expecting any more mixtapes. Because PJ got a bad case of a bullet through the skull. Surprisingly, more brains came out than you'd think. And I hope you weren't expecting to fuck Ezra, because he's dead too. Does anybody have an aspirin? You fucking asshole. Sorry, what's that, Erin? You fucking asshole! There it is. You know, I always wanted to make you scream. You're enjoying this a little too much, Kato. Peterson made the rules. He didn't say we had to feel bad about it. He was going to propose, you fucking psycho! Who, PJ? At a football game? How did you think both of you were going to get out of here alive? You would have made some fucking stupid kids. - You want to see the ring, huh? - No, not really. Look at it, you piece of shit! Look at it! That's all right for a man of his income. What's three months' salary for a guy who makes zero dollars? Fuck you, Kato! Come on, Erin! We're running out of time! Hurry up, Erin! Rian, wait! Please! Please. Help me. Here. Come on. Haven't got all day. Here, Rian, give it back. What are you doing? Even if Kato's completely out of the picture... there's not enough time to change the rules now. What are you doing? Where the fuck are you two? Only one of us can survive. Wait, what the fuck are you doing? I was wondering how you got all that extra time on your vest, Erin. Rian, please, I can explain. Don't do this. You have this, his gun, and you told me he just died? Did you kill my dad, Erin? Rian, I swear it wasn't me. I was there when he died. He was bleeding out. - Ezra was trying... - Put him out of his misery? Huh? He knew your dad wasn't going to make it. By giving me the extra time, it was one friend that didn't have to kill someone else. I'm going to find you. I'm sorry. This whole thing's my fault. How? I introduced you all to Caleb. I brought him into the circle. It was me, Erin. What? What the fuck's going on? I killed Caleb. What? He was trending towards a G.P.A. higher than mine, and... No. Oh, please. And I wanted to be valedictorian at all costs. I-I needed the scholarship. M.I.T. on a cop's salary not going to work. Everyone was taking speed at Ezra's party, and I got my hands on Kato's stash, and... I never meant to kill him. I just wanted enough in his system to show up on a drug test, get him disqualified from being valedictorian. But I fucked up some metric-to-imperial conversion, wound up giving him way too much. I made a really stupid mistake, and Caleb died. No. What are you doing? I let people cover it up. I let my dad cover it up. It wasn't hard to sell him on the idea that Caleb's death was an accident. And I will never forgive myself. I've had to live with that, no one else knowing. But I don't have to live with it anymore. You deserve to walk out of here more than anyone. You definitely deserve it more than me. Take this and do what you need to do, Erin. Don't say that. Take it. All right. Found you! Yeah! Fuck, yes. I'm getting fucking good at this. Turning into John Wick. Oh, yes! Yes. No. That's my kill. You stay away from her, you time-stealing bitch! Fuck you! Fuck you. Well, you may have more time than me, but you know you've only got seconds left to live, right? You don't have the balls to play this game the way it's meant to be played. Do you, Erin? You charity case. Fucking poor person! Don't point that gun at me like you're going to use it. We both know you can't pull that trigger. You basic bitch! Do it. Do it. Pull the trigger, skank. If it wasn't me tonight, it would've been some other guy some other time, guaranteed. Why are we even talking? You won't kill me. You're a left swipe on Tinder. You're a forgettable mute coward who can't kill shit. I don't have to kill you. I've just got to outlast you. Get back here! Erin, you come back here now! This is still killing someone in cold blood! You're a fucking murderer! Fucking femme fatale! I killed people! I put an ax through my girlfriend's skull. I earned the win tonight, not you. Oh, fuck. Fuck. Fuck this. I'm going out on my own terms. Fuck. No! No. Oh, no! Please, help. Somebody help me! Help me, please. Help me, sir, please. Please, help me. All my friends have been killed. Fuck that. Grow a pair, you fucking coward. You fucking fuck! Fuck you!
