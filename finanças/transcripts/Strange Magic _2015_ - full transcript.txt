(CHITTERING) (CHUCKLING) MALE NARRATOR: This is a story about two kingdoms side by side, but worlds apart. All along the border magical flowers grew. Primroses bloom between light and shadow. They are used to make love potion. Because after all everybody deserves to be loved. (LAUGHING) Ooh! (GASPS) (DRONING) (SIGHS) Whoa!

News from the border! You tell him. Huh? Okay. (NERVOUSLY) A fairy flew into our forest. What? And almost took a primrose. A primrose? (BOTH WHIMPERING) I hate this time of year. Spring. Send more goblins to cut down every primrose. No primroses, no potion. No potion, no love. Because love is dangerous. It weakens, it rots. It destroys order. And without order, what is left? Chaos. Destroy the primroses! Or I will destroy you. (BOTH PANTING) Whoa. Stuff. Griselda. Ooh! I need your help. No. You know how your boss, my son, is making everyone miserable with his ban on love? No. Don't you want to see love return to the Dark Forest? No. But I found him the perfect... I told you to stay out of the light! (PANTING) (GROANS) (WHIMPERING) Roland! Oh, thank goodness! Whoa!

You can't look at me! I forgot. Bad luck on our wedding day. Well, too bad you can't see me. (CHUCKLES) My hair is doing that thing we both love. Ahh! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Were you in the Dark Forest? No! Maybe. Yes. You could've been killed. No! Don't look. Or worse, seriously disfigured. Hey! I can take care of myself. That is no place for a princess. Oh, yeah? How about a princess that can do this? (GRUNTING) Marianne, don't play with... Wow! (CHUCKLES) Who's the big girl? You got a sword. Yep. (YELPS) Okay. Yeah, but I don't need a sword. Because when I rule this kingdom, I'll go into that Dark Forest to talk to them. To make it so, at long last, we're not scared anymore. That is so sweet. And then we can all go anywhere we want to have fun, to see things, to have adventures! I'll be your adventure. (SIGHS) Come on, Marianne, my future queen. Aw... My future king. Yeah... King. I'll have an army. Ooh! Yeah. Wait, what? Parry. Lunge. Um... To protect the Fairy Kingdom, and you, my little buttercup. Mmm. Now, go get yourself all prettified. Today has got to be perfect.

If only I was little, like you. Uh-huh. And I could blend in. Like you. I do blend in. (SOBBING) Oh, it would have been perfect! Then we both, you know, me and you, both used the love potion. I'll do it! You will? If you stop crying. What? Oh, I'm much better now. SUNNY: My plan is perfect! All I gotta do is find a primrose flower, get to the castle where I'll find the Sugar Plum Fairy.

And his hair. But, but... Not in that order. But if not Roland, then there has to be someone else! No, there doesn't. Maybe if you got out more often. Let it go, Dad. You'll be a stronger ruler with a king at your side. I'm stronger alone. (GROANS) I don't want you to be alone. (SIGHS) Dad, I promise if I find a guy out there who takes my hand and looks me in the eye and I don't want to hit him... (GROANS) I'll consider it. But that guy doesn't exist.

I'll just tell you. BOTH: (IN UNISON) Great! If you set me free. No! Okay. (CHEERING) Yeah! Then I will reveal the antidote with a story. What? No! (GASPS) One fateful day, when the Bog King was young and impetuous, (GRUNTS) he fell in love with a sweet young thing. Ew! She was the most beautiful creature I ever saw. Seriously? Hmm. He was so in love. But Bog, he had no patience. That's enough! So, he came to me for my love potion. I tried to tell him how it worked. (GRUNTS) But he dusted the sweet, unsuspecting creature. Plum, I beg you. As she was gazing into the eyes of a lovesick Bog... (SCREAMS) (SIGHS) Even with a love potion, I'm too hideous to love. You're not hideous. SUGAR PLUM FAIRY: Hideous, not hideous, whatever! But that's not why the potion didn't work. What? She was already in love with someone else! So, the one thing more powerful than the potion is real love? Bingo! That took forever! Why didn't you tell me? You shut me away, and you shut me up! And Griselda blames me for the no-love-in-the-Dark-Forest! Teaching moment. There are no shortcuts to love. Just saying. Stuff, take it away. Okay, B.K. Here. (WHIMPERING) SUGAR PLUM FAIRY: Wait, wait, wait! Wait a minute! This antidote won't help Dawn. She's never been in love with anybody. (SIGHS) I shouldn't have used the potion on that poor, sweet... Nothing would have been... Real. Well... (SIGHS) I know all about getting your heart broken. I almost married someone who didn't love me. Why? He was so good-looking. Oh. Maybe I couldn't bear to see that he really was a shallow, power-hungry, cheating, chattering, pig son of a... Whoa, whoa, whoa! (SIGHS) Inside, I knew he didn't want me to be... You? Yeah. But you are different. I've been told. That's what I like! I mean, uh... (CLEARS THROAT) Well, you know. (CHUCKLES) So, now I keep my guard up. Me, too. And most important, I never...
