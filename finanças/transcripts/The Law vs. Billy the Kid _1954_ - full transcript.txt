[DIGGING] [WAGON APPROACHING] Whoa! You dig them holes mighty fast, Kid. You got any gopher blood in you? [LAUGHS] Ma never told me, Hank. Your first pay day, Billy. What are you going to do with your money? Get drunk? Get drunk? Him? He's the saving kind. He never buys any drinks. He's too cheap. I don't mind drinking when somebody else buys. Oh! Well, not good. Not bad. If I was setting them up, I'd buy better than this. Give me that back. Say, "please." Give me that! Simmer down, Carl. He's just joking. Here. [LAUGHING] Some kids never learn, they've got to be slapped! Never go for one of those, Billy, unless you're willing to use it. $8.50. That's all you get this time. Look, I worked a month for that money. You forgotten the harness you broke? That harness was so old, Mr. Parson, it... You broke it! What's the matter? Don't you want your money? Hello, Carl. $12 you earned, $12 you get. Here you are. And don't take any wooden saloon gals. [CHUCKLES] Never got any splinters yet! And $12 for you, Garrett. Thanks. Billy Bonney. $5, $6. But that's just half, Mr. Parson. You're new 'round here. You expect the same as the rest? I worked the same as the rest. You got something to learn, Kid. When you work on a place, there's a boss, and what he says goes. Well, here, I'm the boss and I tell you that $6 is all you gonna get. You're smart enough to understand that, ain't you? I don't think I ever want to get that smart. $5 and $1 makes $6. And $6 makes $12. Thank you, Mr. Parson. You'll be sorry you did that, Billy. Easy there now, Mr. Parson! Now, all you can do is fire me. And you better do it quick before I quit. Where'd he go? He got on his horse and scooted. Why? What did he do? He stole $6, the ungrateful punk! Let's go! Well, what are you waiting for? You, Garrett, get your rifle, quick. I'm sorry, Mr. Parson, this is your trouble. Yours and Billy's. All right, Garrett, but if you're around here when I get back, you'll be trespassing. Come on, Carl, we're wasting time! Listen, Billy, I'm giving you a chance. A smart kid'd grab it. Give me back my money and keep going and there's no harm done. Make me take it, you'll get hurt, maybe killed! I'm leaving it up to you. Ain't your life worth more than $6? I don't know, Mr. Parson, ain't yours? Like you said, boss, we're wasting time! Did Parson send you to finish what Trumble started? He's not sending me anywhere anymore, Billy. I'm fired. How much you figure a man's life is worth? Less than $6, that's for sure. He was going to shoot me for $6. Hmm. Maybe you couldn't prove it. If I was you, I'd head right across the line. I'm headed for Lincoln County myself. Want to ride that way? Sure, Pat. Thanks. Well, I made it, Pat. Not even a peep from the law. I wouldn't ever try going back there again, Billy. Well, there's always something better further on anyhow. Man, I'm hungry. We still got better than 20 miles to town. 20 miles? I'm hungry here. Hungry enough to... [COW MOOING] [GUN FIRES] Rare sirloin steak for dinner, Pat. Get a fire going. If the owner of this steer comes along, he'll cook us for dinner. Hmm. I wonder how I'm gonna taste with salt. Keep out of it, Billy. Let me do the talking. Which one of you killed the steer? I did. We both did. We're willing to pay cash. Oh, you'll pay for it, all right. And when I finish taking it out of your hides, you can go back to Murphy and Watkins and tell them what'll happen to anyone else they send out here. Hold on, Bob. I've never seen these two before. Where are you from? From Murphy and Watkins, like all the rest. We never heard of Murphy or Watkins. We just crossed the line this morning. It would seem pointless for Murphy and Watkins to send two men to kill one steer. My name's Tunstall. I own this ranch and the cattle on it. So, uh, I do think I'm entitled to some sort of explanation. Don't you? Where'd you learn to speak English, mister? In England. My home. Why do you ask? Well, you talk real funny. Look, we haven't eaten anything since yesterday morning. We were all set to have some nice rare beef. How much you want for the critter? Cash. That steer... That critter isn't for sale. But if you'll come along to the ranch, we can all have a good feed and we can continue my lessons in the English language, huh? Well, that's jake with me. Uh, I take it he accepts? Yeah, for both of us. Thanks. There are jobs here if you want them. We need help. Yeah, we're shorthanded. Exactly, and why? Our men are being shot at, intimidated. Murdered! Of course, we haven't any proof of that. Oh, it's plain enough. Murphy's the big wheel. He's knocked over every other rancher in the county. Now, he's gunning for us. If he gets rid of Tunstall, here, he'll have the only real spread in the territory. What about the law? That's Sheriff Watkins. He's in Murphy's hip pocket, too. I've appealed to Washington and I'm confident... Well, at any rate, you can see there are obvious dangers. I can take care of myself, Mr. Tunstall. The only thing I care about is if I do a full man's work, do I get full-time pay? Of course! Why? Well, my stomach craves full-time grub. Grub! That's one I do know. It means vittles. I've been doing some research on the origin of your Americanisms and I... My niece. Forgive me, Uncle John. I was busy and I forgot the time. Well, you did use the time to some advantage. However, my dear, let me present Mr. Pat Garrett and Mr. William Bonney. My niece, Miss Nita Maxwell. How do you do? Good evening, Nita. I've never seen you looking so pretty. Oh, do you like it, Bob? It just arrived from New York. Mr. Bonney, if I remember, you prefer your meat rare and rather on the fresh side? Yeah, rather! [CHUCKLING] I understand, of course, that only a few short years ago this was a raw frontier country, and each man was a law unto himself. But I am convinced that the door has shut on that era. In spite of certain backward elements like the unscrupulous Murphy, it's possible to settle disputes peaceably. And young people like Billy and Nita are going to flourish in a civilized community. Does the prospect strike you as dull, Mr. Bonney? Mr. Bonney? Hmm? Uncle John wants to know if you expect to be bored. No, ma'am. The way I figure, life is just starting to get interesting. And so, at long last, my overtures to Washington may be bearing fruit. General Lew Wallace has just been appointed Governor by President Hayes, and the Governor promises to come to Lincoln to investigate the lawlessness here. What are you thinking about, Mr. Bonney? Well, I could tell you better, ma'am, if he didn't sit there watching me like a mountain cat. Then come, Mr. Bonney, and I'll let you tell me exactly what you're thinking about. Will you excuse us, Uncle John? Yes, my dear. Where are you going? We're going for a walk, Bob. I'm quite certain you have no objections. Mr. Bonney. More coffee, gentlemen? He staked a claim on you? Oh, no. I'm fancy free, Mr. Bonney. Is that what you were thinking about? Well, that and other things. You from England, too, like your uncle? Native New Mexican. I've never even been to Santa Fe. And you? I was born in New York. Of course, I've been out this way since I was five. Then you don't remember much about it. Enough. There were a few empty spaces, but Ma filled them in for me. It's better out here. But New York has theaters and big buildings and wonderful cafes, and I've read all about it. You got a father? Yes. New York killed mine. Lungs. After that, Ma was mostly on the run. Always running from something, or to something. Last time she ran clear to Kansas and married some guy. Ah, that was a big mistake. You grew up in Kansas? Most people think I haven't grown up yet. I've been just drifting since I was 12. Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, places. Why? Oh, man's got to find the right place to light. Sometimes he finds a place that's real pretty. Sometimes he finds something else pretty. You don't seem the least bit sorry for yourself. Sorry? Well, no home or family. Never had much call to think about it. I get along. You've been a man a long time, haven't you? We're being impolite. We'd better go back. Uh... What you said about being fancy free... Yes? Well, I'm glad you're free. And I'm sure glad you're fancy. That new stallion threw him. I was trying to bust the critter when all of a sudden this pain gets me in the stomach. Better not try to talk, Charley. I'll be all right. Got these before. They always go away. If it hadn't been for the kid here dragging me out of the corral, I'd a been stomped flat for sure. Thanks, Billy. It was right kind of you. You ain't got much sense, Kid, risking your neck to save an old coot like Charley Bowdre. We could use another hand at stud. How about it, Kid? You men take care of Charley. I want to talk to Billy. Charley, if that bothers you again, let me know. You may need a doctor. Ah, you ruined the flush. [LAUGHS] Sorry, Dave. I've been watching you these last few weeks, Billy. Yeah? I've never seen a man work so hard or take so many chances. You're ambitious, aren't you? Well, maybe it's just I found a place to hang my hat. Yes, of course. But you know, you could raise a loan to start a small ranch. I might be able to help, if you'd make up your mind about the future. That's what I keep thinking about, Mr. Tunstall, the future. So, you wanted to see New York, huh? All right. Ha! Ha! Let's see now. See, over there's Madison Square Garden. Put on some right handsome horse shows there. Oh, it's lovely. What's that over there? That, uh... Oh, that's Delmonico's. Bet you never ate steaks like that. Neither did you. You said you left New York when you were five. When are you going home? Oh, I'll be visiting with Uncle John for a little longer. But I'll see you, Billy. Our place is just outside Lincoln. Not too far. I don't think any place would be too far. I sure never thought two weeks would make such a difference. Before, days seemed to just pass without much matter. Seems like that spot's been just asking for it for two weeks. You know, Uncle John thinks you're a very nice young man. So do I. Well, neither one of us is very respectable. We're not? Well, seeing New York together without even being married? You know, a fellow once bet me I couldn't hit this with a shotgun if he chucked it in the air. I won the bet with a rifle. And now we can see New York respectably? Well, sure, sure. I never thought it would take a shotgun to get us married! We better leave New York now, Billy. You'll be doing me a favor if you keep it. You'd like very much to feel that you belong to someone, wouldn't you? Not just anyone. I'll keep it. [GROANS] Let me give you a little piece of advice while you can still hear, Kid. Stay away from this ranch and stay away from Nita. Understand? This ain't my ruckus, Bob, but don't you think you've made your point? Oh, stay out of this, Charley! [METAL CLANKING] TUNSTALL: Bob! I insist on an explanation, Bob, and a good one! Just a little matter of discipline, that's all. He gave me trouble, so I gave him a little trouble before firing him! You discharged him? Without consulting me? You want to keep him or me? Make up your mind. That's not the point. The choice is between my methods and yours. You can get your pay tomorrow. Tonight. I hope I'm wrong, but I think you made a mistake, Ollinger. You'd have been better off if you'd have killed him. Now, he'll kill you. You'd better take him to the house. He needs care. There's a spare bedroom at the end of the hall. Dave, Tom! Billy, you must stay out of his way. You must. He fixed it so you'd see me like this. There's no place he could go that I'd stay out of his way. Even if I tell you that I hate him now? Why? You don't have to keep seeing me look like this. But that's silly. I saw you before. How much do you hate him, Nita? Billy, don't... How much? As much as you want me to. But I'm in a hurry. General Wallace is on his way here. After he arrives, it may be too late. Be reasonable, Murph. [SCOFFS] You know as well as I do Tunstall's no sheep-herding... Hold it! Good morning, Mr. Murphy. Sheriff. Well, enter the ambassador from Great Britain. No more. I've already turned in my striped pants. I ain't working for Tunstall. What's the matter? Get sick of tea? Well, tell us about it. I think I got a little business for you, Sheriff. You got anything on a young rat named Bonney? Bill Bonney? Never heard of him. Well, he's a stranger around here. Last night I heard something that made me think he's a killer on the run. Ah, I got a batch of wanted posters here I haven't looked at. Let's see. Bonney, you said, huh? Bill Bonney. Here, wanted for murder. "William Bill or Billy Bonney by the sheriff of Henderson County. "$100 reward." That's him, that punk. He's working out at Tunstall's. Why don't you go out there and drag him in? He hasn't done anything in my county. Seems like a lot of trouble for 100 bucks. Besides, I might get shot up. Listen, Sheriff, that shiny badge on your vest... Bob, why don't you go over to the saloon and have a drink on me? I'll be right there. All I want is for this tall drink of water to go out and do his... Now, Bob, I promise you the laws of Lincoln County will be strictly enforced. Sheriff Watkins will arrest your murderer today. Now, go on over and have that drink. Let me handle this. Murphy, you ain't paying me enough for this kind of work. You know for singing sure I ain't going to tangle with no fly-away killer for 100 bucks! Yes, you will, Tom. You're going to make two arrests. One on Bonney for murder, and one on Tunstall for harboring a fugitive! You know, Mr. Tunstall, the way you're clucking over me, well, shucks, I've been beat up before. You don't have to take me to town to see a doctor. Perhaps it would be easier for you if you thought of it this way. I'm treating you as I would my own boy. There's a difference, don't you see? That's funny. Well, I just never had anybody worry about me before. Billy, Pat said something last night. He told Bob Ollinger you might kill him. What did he mean? Just that. Billy, have you ever killed a man? If that makes any difference in how you feel about me, I won't hold it against you. I can just keep riding. I didn't bring anything with me when I came, and, well, like I said, I can just keep riding. I don't care about what's past. I care about now. I want you to promise me you won't kill Ollinger. But he'll come gunning for me! I want to know if you'll be gunning for him. Look, you saw what happened last night. I... All right, all right. I'll play it your way. Thanks, Billy. Well, I just hope you're right about everything. Oh, I am. You'll see. You know, I have a feeling that things are going to be different as long as I'm with you. Maybe you've changed my luck. [HORSES APPROACHING] I guess I spoke too soon. Looks like the law, lots of it. We've nothing to fear from the law. I have. Mr. Tunstall, you're under arrest! Oh? I suppose you and Murphy have concocted some charge? Now, you ought to know I wouldn't slip up on a trifling little detail like that. Harboring a fugitive, that's the charge and I'll make it stick. Got something there for you to look at. Pick it up. Certainly. Look, Tom, I... I thought he was going for his gun. That's exactly what he was doing, pulling a gun on the law. That's the way you'll all testify. They murdered him. They ain't going to get away with it. I'm going after them. Are you with me? I got a wife and two kids, Billy. Tom? I reckon. Watkins is the law. It ain't smart fooling with the law. Well, I always was a fool. No need to stop now. I'm with you. All right, you two get the horses. Tom, help me with him. Me and Nate'll leave you here. No sense in riding into town and then riding back. Sure, Al, you go on home. And don't you worry about anything. Look! We'll swing around in front of them! Come on! BILLY: Where's Watkins and the others? Gone back to town. What's on your mind? Killing you. Killing me? That's right. For murdering Tunstall. Go find Watkins. Tell him that Bill Bonney did it, and that every man in the posse will answer for Tunstall's murder. If they don't answer to the law, they'll answer to me. We'll hide out until tonight. Let's go. Pat Garrett says he'll stay on and run the ranch, Nita. There's nothing else we can do. Thank you, Mr. Garrett. Where you been, Billy? I'm sorry, Nita. Oh, this is Mr. Maxwell. It's Nita's father. I all ready got one of them. O'Folliard, Bowdre and Rudabaugh are with me, and we're going to get the rest of them. More killing, Billy? That's not the way, Kid. What'll we do, Pat? Ask Sheriff Watkins to hang himself and all his deputies? Mr. Garrett's right, Billy. There's a law higher than Mr. Watkins. The Governor... Could be you're just plain mixed up, Pat. Scared, maybe. Billy. You've already killed one. Please stop now. You think I'm wrong. I only know you might be killed. They'll never kill me, Nita. Tell me where I can find you. I'll be at home at El Fortin. I'll find you there. Governor Wallace is looking for a new sheriff. Someone who wants to play patty-cake with Billy the Kid. [PEOPLE LAUGHING] Anybody who believes in shooting down outlaws, don't bother to apply. Well, hello, Pat. We've been waiting for you. Governor Wallace, this is Pat Garrett. I'm very glad to know you, Mr. Garrett. Governor. I hear you've done a share of shooting in your time. Meaning what, sir? Oh, meaning that you can take care of yourself, that you can finish what you start out to do. Oh, I put my rifle up some time ago. I've got a good job running the Tunstall ranch. I need a sheriff for Lincoln County. I need someone who's had no part in the quarrels of the past. Someone who can create a respect for the law. Well, the first thing your sheriff's going to have to do is bring in Billy Bonney. I'm a friend of Billy's. Precisely. I want to talk to Mr. Bonney as I've talked to the others. If you're sheriff, Mr. Bonney will have some confidence in the law and may agree to listen to my proposals. Maybe you don't know it, Governor, but Billy's going around bragging that Bowdre, O'Folliard, Rudabaugh and himself have killed some of the members of that posse. And they intend killing more. I know all about that. Then what's the use? You plan to talk Billy into putting the rope around his own neck? I plan to offer him an opportunity to go free. And Watkins and the others, too? Yes. I can't undo the damage that's already done. That's fair enough. But if Billy don't see it that way, it means I'm his hangman. I'm afraid you miss my point. Unless you accept my offer, Billy Bonney will soon be dead. How come? I will declare martial law in Lincoln County and order my troops to shoot Bonney on sight. Putting it that way, you don't leave me much elbow room. Anybody see you? Good. Not a soul. Oh! It's you, Billy. Yeah, it's me. Look, you wanted horses, you got 'em. Well, let's go out and take a look at them. Now, wait a minute. You can count them if you want to, there are 10 of them. But no closer. What do you mean, no closer? I got to see them before I buy them, don't I? Now, look at it my way. Suppose you don't buy the horses, you know where they came from. Well, you can queer any other deal for me. Yeah, I guess you're right. What do you want for them? 12 bucks a head. They any good? Well, I haven't had time to count their teeth. They look all right. Look, if you want to back down at my price, just say so. Now, I ain't said nothing about backing down. You know me better than that, Billy. Here you are. Just a moment. You didn't get them horses from around here, did you? Because if you did, you can get me in a heap of trouble. That owner can have me in court. Or in a grave. Look, I guarantee you the owner will never even miss them. All right, Billy. Here you are, son. You're slick. Yes, sir, you're awful slick. But I'll tell you one thing, Billy, you ain't no business man. Tell you why. I'd have gone as high as $25, $30 a head for them. Well, I guess I am new at these things, but a deal's a deal. Oh, yeah. Good night, Mr. Dodge. Good luck to you, son. Slim! Slim! Come out here. Yeah, boss? Look over there. Billy just dropped off them flock of stolen horses and I want to get them out of sight before light. I'll bet you do. Yeah. I'm kind of anxious to see what he brung. Yeah, me too. [CHUCKLES] You know something, Slim? You know what I paid for these here horses? What? $12 apiece! $12? You sure they all got legs? [LAUGHS] That dumb kid! I'd have gone as high as $40 or $50, I might have gone to $60. If he... Slim, it's my brand. [ANGRILY] He sold me my own horses! I'm seeing Nita tonight and I want to buy her a present. You mean Dodge is going to buy her a present. [LAUGHS] Me, I feel lucky, and when I feel lucky I take a crack at faro. I'll stick to drinking. Like to feel I'm getting my money's worth. You, Dave? The usual. Doris, huh? You'll be lucky if she keeps saying no. [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] [MEN URGING HORSES] Ah, Billy, welcome to my place. It is truly a pleasure to see you again. Good to see you, too, Tio. Look, I want to buy something. You know, it's a... Well, it's a present. This gift, Billy, it is perhaps for a senorita? Yeah. Well, let's see now. Here, this looks pretty good. How much? Billy, may I ask, the senorita, it is possible she is someone special? Yeah, very, very special. Billy, these are not for such a one. I have what you must give to her. Un momento. Well, I guess you know more about these things than I do. How much? It is not for sale. It is my gift to you to give to your senorita. And the ring should be with it if she someday to be your wife. [SIGHS] Well, maybe someday, Tio. But not right now. Look, what do you mean "not for sale"? I can pay for the pin. No, Billy. It was to be for my daughter to wear at her wedding. Well, what happened? Jose, who was to be her husband was killed. Murdered the day before the wedding. I'm sorry. I... I didn't know. Who killed him? A posse. SenorWatkins said Jose was trying to escape. Jose who was innocent of any wrong. Watkins, huh? Listen, Tio, Watkins ain't... [HORSE APPROACHING] [THANKING IN SPANISH] Well, wearing a badge, huh? You working with Watkins? Easy, Billy. Governor Wallace is here. He fired Watkins, made me sheriff. That'll take a little getting used to. Pat, if you have any idea about bringing me in, forget it. I'm not out to arrest you, Billy, I'm just... Wait a minute! Why, of course, with you sheriff, we can get Watkins and the others legal. It's like you said, Pat, let the law do it, huh? Sorry, I don't think that's the plan. Why not? What's the good of your being sheriff? I didn't come here to argue. I came to tell you that Governor Wallace wants to see you. What about? I'll let him tell you. Can't hurt you. A waste of time. Pat, you ain't scheming something up between those two big ears, are you? No, Billy. You see, the Governor and I guarantee you walk away free as you are now after you listen to him. So what can you lose? I don't know. Tell you what. I'll be at Nita's house tonight. 9:00. If the Governor's still in a talking mood, you tell him to come and see me. Fine. I think I can arrange it. Pat. I'll never get used to you wearing that badge. We've gone a long way, Billy. An awful long way. Billy! [BOTH SPEAKING IN SPANISH] Oh, Billy! I wanted to talk to you before you went in to see Governor Wallace. Want to make sure I don't kick over the traces, huh? Listen to what he has to say. Listen carefully, please, for our sakes. Oh, just like my mom. You know, she used to think that just because somebody turned over a new leaf, that all the pages that went before were erased, nice and clean. Your ma was a smart woman, Billy. Lots of people make new lives for themselves. I want that for us, too, and Governor Wallace can give it to us. I have something for you. It's a surprise. Aren't you going to open it? Later, Billy. When you go inside, remember, I love you. In Ben Huryou've written a memorable book, Governor. Thank you. Incidentally, I've learned more from it about Roman history than I ever did at school. I'll never get used to you wearing that badge, Pat. Governor Wallace, I hear you wanted to talk to me. Hello, Mr. Maxwell. Hello, Billy. I'll leave you to have your talk now. Sit down, Billy. Thank you, Governor. What would you say if I offer to get you off free? No punishment for any killing you ever committed? I'd say you were a man who has something to say. What happened? You and Pat got Watkins all measured up for a noose? I'm afraid it won't be possible to punish Watkins and the members of the posse. I don't get it. Watkins, an officer of the law, claims he was performing his duty. Every actual witness supports his story. That's what I figured you'd say. You, on the other hand, are a professed killer. If you'll submit to arrest now, we'll bring you to trial at once. If you are convicted, I, as Governor, will pardon you immediately and restore you to full citizenship. You said, "Let the law take care of it," Pat. This what you had in mind? The Governor's offering you a square deal, Billy. Now, go along with it all the way. What about Tunstall? Watkins and his men shot him down without giving him a chance. I saw it and I'm not forgetting it. Hmm, morally, perhaps you're right, but, uh, legally... You stick to legal, Governor, I'll stick to right and wrong. One more thing, Billy. If you don't accept the Governor's deal, I'll have to hunt you down and bring you to trial. But that way there won't be any pardon. You got 24 hours to make up your mind. My mind's made up now. All I need is about three minutes to talk to Nita. Good night, Governor. [DOOR CLOSES] What happened, Billy? Ah, just a lot of talk for nothing. They want me to stand trial. Do you like it? It's lovely. But I... Nita, there's a ring that goes with it. I could get it for you. Marriage means a lot, Billy. It means a lot of tomorrows for two people. Without a trial, I could never count on tomorrow. I'd never know when you'd be shot, or arrested, or hanged. Nita. Do you want me to let Watkins and the others get away with killing your uncle? I don't know what to think anymore! Why do you have to go on and on? Do you like to kill, Billy? Stop it! [SIGHS] Maybe I'm selfish, but all I know is you can't bring uncle John back to life again. All you can do is lose your own. I want that ring, Billy, and all that it means. And if you really want the same thing, get the ring for me, but it'll mean that you'll do what the Governor wants you to do. Goodnight, darling. Nita. Buenas noches,Billy. Hello, Tio. Listen, do you still have that ring? But of course! It is yours. I have it with me. You knew I'd come back, huh? To get married. It's the way of man and the will of God. I just hope you're right, Tio. May you live long and in happiness. [THANKING IN SPANISH] [MEN SPEAKING IN SPANISH] Hello. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Whiskey. Relax. [PEOPLE MURMURING] I didn't come here for a shooting. I'll take that drink later. BARTENDER: Billy! Hold it, Bob! I hate to disappoint you, Billy, but I ain't going to blubber for you. Go ahead, have your fun. That's what I had in mind, Bob, having my fun. I'm thinking about the last time we met. Remember? See those deer horns over on that wall? Get over and take a good look at them. Remember that night outside Tunstall's barn? I'd just hung up my gun belt. Suppose you hang up yours. Now. Go on. What's the matter, Bob? These are your rules, don't you like them? [EXHALES] Sorry about the mess, Pedro. I am sorry too, Billy. [MEN CHATTERING] It's too bad after Billy decided to give himself up, he ran into Watkins. Now, he's got Charley Bowdre, Tom O'Folliard, and Dave Rudabaugh with him, holed up in a place called Faro Springs. It's going to be awful cold. Maybe Billy'll still be there and maybe he won't. I know it's Christmas. Maybe we'll be back for Christmas tomorrow, and maybe we won't. So anybody want to quit, quit now. That's all. [MEN CHATTERING] I was afraid you were going to turn in your badge. At least, that'd been my guess. Mine, too. But you see, those men out there don't know Billy. All they know is he killed a man named Watkins, and a lot of others, and he's maybe making them miss Christmas. They get him, they'll be in a lynching mood. Only someone's going to be there to stop them. That's why I'm still wearing the badge, Mr. Maxwell. [DOOR OPENS] Deputize me, Garrett. I'm going along. Not necessary. I got plenty of men. What's the matter, Sheriff? You scared to have somebody come along who'll make sure your Billy boy won't get away? All right, you're deputized. Now, get out! [DOOR CLOSES] See what I mean? [BLOWS AIR] [BOWDRE MOANING] Need some more water, Charley? Uh-uh. Don't do no good. What a time for this to come back. At least you ain't on a stallion this time, Charley. Tunstall once said he had something inside that might bust, and if it did bust, it'd kill him. Ain't there nothing we can do? Yeah, I told you, you can get out of here, all of you. You ain't doing me no good sticking around. [GROANS] And Garrett ain't going to waste no time getting here. When we leave, you're riding with us. Besides, maybe Pat'll think it's too cold to come out. Want to make a little bet, Billy? [HORSES APPROACHING] Wait! Don't shoot until they're in range. We need all the shells we got. We'll tie up here. I want that shack sealed tighter than a jam jar. But no shooting unless I say so. Got it? Billy, can you hear me? You always did have a voice like a bull moose, Pat. You and your boys come out, hands in the air where we can see them. You won't get hurt. You got a minute to think it over. I don't know how you boys feel about getting hurt. But the way I figure, hanging is just about as uncomfortable as a bullet. I never like nothing around my neck, except maybe Doris's arms. I'm the backward kind. Don't like a lot of folks around me when I'm doing something important, like dying. Pat! We just had vote, real democratic, and the returns are all in! [GUN FIRES] All right, men! Get anything? I'm not staying up there long enough o find out! Well, at least it was quick! Yeah, we got a great future wondering if the end will be quick! [GROANING] Garrett. Cover me and I'll rush the door! Sorry, I'm not risking lives unnecessarily. They're running out of shots in there. Right now we'll keep them shooting. BOWDRE: [SOBBING] Billy! Do me a favor, Billy. Shoot me! Shoot me! I can't stand this in my belly! You'd do it for a hurt horse. Please, Billy, please! Charley! Charley! O'FOLLIARD: Charley! BILLY: Charley! Hold it! What's the matter? Why don't you shoot? [GROANS] Why did you have to get on my side? Now, they're running low in there, men. Pour it on! Maybe you should change your mind, Tom. You're not in this as deep as I am. You still got a good chance of getting out of this! [GUN CLICKS] [GUN CLICKS] Take a rest! I'm taking a look, so cover me! Howdy, Pat. Merry Christmas, Billy. You men who live north might as well cut out there! And thanks for your help! Now, it's too cold and too late to try and make Lincoln tonight. Maxwell's place is the closest, we'll stop there. This is going to be the best Christmas I ever had! I can hardly wait till Nita sees Billy boy in these things! [LAUGHING] Come on, Billy. Let's go. Come on. [CHILDREN LAUGHING] [CHUCKLES] That's right. Put them all in. Be careful with the pinata. That's it. That's right. That's it. Now, who's going to be the first to be blindfolded? [CHILDREN SHOUTING] Nita. I'm afraid. I don't know if he's been hurt, or captured, or killed! But the pinata, Nita. It will make the children happy. Perhaps that'll help you, huh? Come on. All right, children. We're all ready for the blindfolding. Who's going to be blindfolded? CHILDREN: Me! Me! Let's start with Anna Marie. You'll all have your turns. Have the handkerchief, Dad? Oh, yes! Get it tight around you, so you can't see. Merry Christmas, Pat. Did you just come for the party? Or is it something else? It's something else. I got Billy outside in handcuffs. In handcuffs? [CHILDREN SHOUTING] I don't want to hurt Nita! That's why I left him outside. We got to hole up someplace until dawn. I figured maybe you might have a room She wouldn't see him. Of course. Just have your men take him around to the back. Merry Christmas, folks! And look at the present we got for you out here. All tied up in chain ribbons! Billy the Kid! [CHILDREN CHEERING] Let's go, Kid. Pat. [CHILDREN LAUGHING] Give me a minute alone with Nita. Only a minute. You got a minute. Thanks. [DOOR CLOSES] Don't look like that, Nita. How do you want me to look? Shall I smile bravely and act unafraid when you have a noose around your neck? The noose isn't there yet. And it won't be. Sure, the trial will say "Guilty." They'll never hang me. I need you, Nita. Need me? I don't have a gun, Billy. If I did have, I'd give it to you. No, no, not a gun. I need you to love me. To believe in me, to tell me I'm right. I don't know. Oh, but I do know that you always wanted to be right. That's good enough for me. I'll come for you. Wait for me. The ring! You didn't bring it to me. I didn't keep our bargain, Nita. I tried. I want it anyway. It fits. [SIGHS] [DOOR OPENS] Sorry, Billy, but a minute's not very long. Long enough, Pat. Thanks. [OLLINGER LAUGHING] OLLINGER: Yeah, Billy, that trapdoor does creak a little bit. Still, it works real smooth like. Oh, no, that sandbag fell through clean as an arrow. Oh, I can see it dangling now. Happy New Year, Kid! [LAUGHING] I'll take over now, Bob. Sorry I'm late. Ah, don't mention it, Jack. I always enjoy my little visits with Billy. You know, Billy's a good listener these days. And Betsy here can hardly wait for her chance to speak. [LAUGHING] The keys are on the desk there. Any word from Garrett? Yeah, I heard he'll be in late tomorrow. Seems they're having a little fracas out at Doc Lester's. Good. Gives Billy and me more time to play games, with Betsy acting as a referee, of course. See you later. You've got him. What are you doing up there? Just trying to rig a curtain, Jack. Always a bunch of jokers outside peeking in. Even some women. Well, get down and stay down! You got word for me? Bad news, Billy. I didn't want to tell you in front of Ollinger. Governor Wallace, huh? Says how he gave you your chance and you wouldn't take it, and how as you had a fair trial. So he does, Jack, so he does. You didn't touch your dinner, Billy. [GUNSHOTS FIRING IN THE DISTANCE] Well, I can't stomach to eat with Ollinger watching every bite. But I'm hungry enough now. Sure could eat a fried steak. Oh, now, Billy, you know I can't leave you alone, not even a minute. Just a step across the street. Connie'll send it over with her boy. Never know you to have such an appetite, Billy. All right. I'll tell Connie to send over one steak. Rare. Thanks, Jack. [GUNSHOTS CONTINUE] Billy! Billy! Where are you? Billy! Take them off! You been real nice to me, Jack. Don't make me kill you! Okay, on the bunk! Face the wall. Thanks, Jack! No! [TRAPDOOR CREAKING] Big night, huh, Joe? Oh, yeah! Why, they darn near wrecked the place. We had a great time. Anybody inside now? No, everybody's gone home. Say, I want to tell you... Billy. Happy New Year, Joe. Happy New Year. [PIANO PLAYING] [OLLINGER LAUGHING] That ain't the way to start a New Year, with a hanging. [SOFTLY] You figure the tip the blacksmith gave us is straight? [SOFTLY] Could be. Maybe Billy's figuring on taking Nita with him. Poe, you and McKinney come with me and stake out. The rest of you, hide these horses. MAXWELL: Yes, who is it? Pat Garrett, Mr. Maxwell. Like to talk to you. Hello, Pat. Come in, come in. [DOOR OPENS] Billy! Oh, Nita! All these months without any word from you! I couldn't take a chance before. But everything's all right now. We'll cross the border, then head for a place near Hermosillo in Mexico. It's pretty, Nita. Awfully pretty. Just like a place you'd dream about. With you, any place is the place I dream about. Get some things together! Hurry now! [GUN FIRES] Billy! [CRYING] You got him, Pat. Yeah, I got him. Where are you going? Away, Jack. Just away. He said no one would ever kill him.
