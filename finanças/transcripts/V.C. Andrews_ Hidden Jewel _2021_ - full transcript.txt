Help me... Help me... Another one? Tell me what you saw. Come on, Mom. It was just a dream. Come here. Go to sleep now. You've got a big day tomorrow, Miss Valedictorian. Pearl had another nightmare last night. I'm concerned about her. Morning. Sleep well the rest of the night? Fine. Except... somehow my cap has disappeared. Anyone? Jean? Pierre? I mean, what type of cap? Like a, like a bottle cap? Nice try. Now go get your sister's graduation cap. All right, give it here. Thank you. All right, let's get you kids ready. Yes. I'm so lucky, Pearl, to have you and your wonderful brothers. I remember when I was your age. It doesn't seem long ago at all. And now my daughter's 18? All grown up. Trying. But hopefully even when you're my age you'll always feel the freedom of being a kid, and not burdened like so many people are. Burdened by what? Well, a lot of people can't let go of their demons, or of their past. You have to let bygones be bygones. That's what I say. Is that why you never wanna tell me what it was like when you were my age? Sweetie... It's fine. I know it wasn't glamorous. It's a long story. But thank god I survived and was able to find happiness with your father, the boys, and you. Your mama is strong. Nina, you're here! I'm so glad to see you. Nina helped me during a really bad time when I was young. Without her I couldn't have gotten through it. Your mama and daddy are so proud of you, Pearl. Real slick. What does it say, kick me? My vote was for kick me, but Pierre thought a poem would be a little bit nicer. To our beautiful big sis, whom we'll soon miss, your big day is here, and there's nothing to fear, for wherever you are, our hearts will be near. Thank you. Thanks, Jeeves, we're all 18. You really should try this. Hey, sweetheart. Looking good. It's really delicious. Nina, this dish is so good. Mmm. My father lived for this jambalaya. Oh, your daddy. He was a good man. Mmm. Are you feeling any better? Comme ci, comme ca. But I wouldn't miss this joyous celebration for the world. Did you know that Pearl is class valedictorian? Mom. Now, you are embarrassing this poor girl, bragging like this. Though, I have to admit, there's a lot about her to brag about. Mmmhmm. I'd like to make a toast to my wonderful daughter, Pearl. You're my shining jewel and I'm so proud of you today, and every day. To Pearl. To Pearl. Good going, seriously. Smooth, Jean. No poem this time? Nah, Pierre's more the poet. Me, I'm the clever one. Right. It's so nice that you're graduating. Hi, Jeanne. I'm so happy you made it. Oh, it's wonderful to be here. Congratulations, Pearl. I heard about Tulane, and I got you a little gift. Oh, Jeanne. Thank you so much. Oh, look at you. Who is this man? Well, that's your Uncle Paul, of course, though I don't remember putting that particular photo in there. You don't? I mean, maybe I did. Hon, what is it? This is the man I've been seeing in my nightmares. Paul? A... and what do you see? I'm lost and wandering and... I see him in the water, tangled. Is he dead? Dead in the water? How did you know? Mom? Tell me. What is it? Paul drowned. He committed suicide. And Jeanne said she didn't put it in the book, which means it's an omen. An omen of what? Something bad is gonna happen. I can feel it. Babe, you have to let go of these silly Bayou Cajun superstitions. They're not silly, Beau. She's right. I've seen things. And grandmére, she... she always told me to never boast. Pride is the devil's eye. It's what lets him in. Now this photo and Pearl's dreams and Paul. It means something. Maybe it's just memories. Memories? But you were a baby when you last saw him. I must still remember, though, somewhere deep inside. But I never told you he drowned. Give me this book. Is everything okay? Fine. Fine. I... I'm so happy you came. I do miss you. Thank you so much for the photo album. Of course. Are you ready to go back to my place? My parents are gone so it's just a few of us. Um, let's just stay here a little while longer. I feel bad leaving after my parents planned all this. What about what we planned? Finally doing this tonight. Okay, fine. Let me just go talk to my mom for a minute, then we can go. Sweetie, come on. Everything okay? Are you gonna go out with your friends? Yeah, they want to. Well, do be careful, and... I know what I'm doing. Honey, I... I know that. You're an adult and whatever your gut says, and whatever you choose... I... I think I just need to go lie down. Are you not feeling well? No, I... I'll be fine. You know, I think I'll stay here. Really? That would very much make me happy. I just worry. Let me just tell them I'm gonna stick around. Okay. Come on, Pearl, uh, let's go. It's just, it's the party and it would be rude of me to leave, so- So we'll stay and do it here. Wait... where are we going? In the house with my parents? Look, I know you're nervous, but you just gotta take the plunge. Uh, it's just... I just think that- That's right, you think too much. I don't wanna have sex until it feels special. And this doesn't feel special? No! Not now, not with- With what? With me? Oh, my god. Claude, I didn't mean not- That's what you were gonna say, right? But no, it's not because it's with you- I'm like a ten, Pearl, and you're like a six. You're lucky you even date me. Okay, this is over. Oh, you do not get to dump me, I'm dumping you first. Like, seriously, I can't get you to feel anything, like any emotion whatsoever. Not like I was even looking for that. What were you looking for? A challenge. To see if I could get with somebody who's such a prude. Which doesn't matter now because all my friends think I did, anyway. You lied? What did you tell them? That we did it in a lab, and you took notes. Now give me back my promise ring. Kids can be so mean. But as strong as you are, as strong as your grandmére, you'll be just fine. Except I don't know the first thing about love. Sweetie, to love you have to keep your heart as open as your mind. But I'm just afraid. Just trust your gut. Not just your brain. Trust your gut? That's just an expression, Mom. There's no decision making brain cells in your gut. But you feel something there, right? And what's that? I'll tell you what it is. It's what got me through a living hell. Growing up was really that bad? Not with grandmére. But finding out the man you're in love with was your half-brother? And then my terrible twin sister, Gisselle. She almost ruined it for me with your father. But I trusted my gut, did what I had to do, lord forgive me, and that's what got me through all of it. That, and a little of grandmére's Cajun Gris-Gris. Here. This is for you. For good luck. For good Gris-Gris to ward off evil spirits. Mom, you don't have to. I want to. But I know you don't believe in any of it- But your art opening is happening tomorrow and I know it means so much to you. And that's why I want you to have it. Especially with... What? Nothing. Just those dreams. And that picture of Paul. Mom- I know, I know. I'm just being silly. Here. Come here. I love you, Mom. I love you, too. Well, I guess the reason I don't paint from memories is the world around us is so beautiful and rich, and capturing that is what my art is about. It's about the present, and the future... Ruby? I'm looking for Ruby Dumas. Clarice, is everything okay? No, it's not, Ruby. My sister Nina is nearing her end. It all happened very suddenly, and as a last resort we took her to Mama Dede's. It's what Nina wanted. Oh, my god. Nina, no. I'm not here for her sake, but for yours. She said she needs to give you something before she goes. A warning, she says. About what? I don't know. But she says it's urgent. You best come tonight because I don't know that she'll make it till the morning. I've got to be going, but you need to take care of yourself, you hear me? Yeah, you too. What's wrong, Mama? Nina, she's sick. I have to leave and go see her. How sick? She's dying, Pearl. And she means more to me than this show. I gotta go. Then I'm coming with you. Nina helped me when Gisselle was being so evil to me. She knew a woman, a powerful voodoo queen, who put a curse on Gisselle to stop her. Ruby, tell Mama Dede your troubles. I have a sister, a twin sister. Ah, la marassa. For some reason she just seems to hate me. I just want her to stop hurting me. Gisselle was riding in a car and got into a horrible accident. Her boyfriend died and she... she was paralyzed. The spell will be very strong now. Very strong. I have to open up to what I've done. Nina called out your name. She said she had a message for you from the dead. Y'all are too late. She gone now. Oh, Nina. Nina, Nina. So there was something she wanted me to know. Do you know what it was, Mama Dede? Je ne sais pas. All of that is between you and her and the dead now. But I have to know. Ruby... You know what to do. Bring a sacrifice to the cemetery tonight at midnight. That's the only way to speak to her spirit now. By killing a rabbit? By Bringing an offering. Your mama needs to know what Nina saw near death. She must have glimpsed something on the other side that made her want to warn her. Paul was a good man. He was trying to tell you the same thing in your dream. Tell me what? A warning. That bad Gris-Gris is descending upon us because of something I did. What? What did you do? I don't know. But I have to figure out what it is and atone for it. Mama- If I don't, something awful is going to happen. Mark my words. When the dead try to speak... No, no. Guys, this is... Bodies can do this. It's reflexes relaxing. Air being released from the lungs. What makes you so sure, child? I worked in a hospital this summer. Mm-hmm. I'm so sorry about Nina, mama, but you can't believe these things. Let's go home, okay? What are you doing? Singing an old Catholic prayer to the saints that grandmére sang. About what? About accepting our sins. And the incense? Something Mama Dede told me to try. Just in case. In case what? Unfriendly spirits. Mama. Honey, people all over the world believe in them in some form or another. Can they all be wrong? What is a spirit even supposed to be? A thing, like a life force in the past that lingers beyond its death. Will you come inside, Mama? It's cold. See? What was that? It's probably just an upset neighbor. Let's go inside. Come on. Listen, Mom. "The exhibit showcased a masterful body of work. "A profound post-modern panoply of allegorical inquisitions "and disquisitions that stir the soul." I don't know what that means, but it sounds like they loved it. She's still upset, huh? It's just, she says that Nina has a message from the grave, and she and a woman she called Mama Dede were talking about killing a rabbit in a cemetery. Look, I'm not one to disrespect anyone's beliefs or traditions, but this Bayou faith she has? It's the one thing she hasn't been able to let go of. I'm worried about her, Poppa. I suppose she just has to grieve in her own unique Bayou way. I have an idea. What if we all go to the country house for a couple of days? It might help her and all of us to relax and unwind. That's a good idea. Let's do it. Mom, let's have a good time. Relax. If you're thinking about Nina- Oh, I know. It'll all be fine, I hope. Well, that drive always wears me out. I'm gonna head up for a nap. -Last one outside is a loser! -No fair, you got a head start! Be careful! Yeah, yeah. Jean, Jean, look. Do you see it? There's a turtle on the rock. Woah, cool. Jean, Jean, wait! There's a snake! Watch out! Mom! Dad! Jean got bit by a snake! Yes. 241 Bayou Bend. My brother just got bit by a snake. Please hurry. Mom! Dad! Hurry! What happened? Snake bite. It's all my fault. I told him to go in there. We need to slow the spread of poison to his heart. We need his torso elevated. Here, let's prop him up against the tree. Oh, my baby. What have I done? His heart's beating too fast. Jean, you have to stay awake, okay? Don't close your eyes. I'm going to start a line. Is he breathing? Why won't he open his eyes? Beau? Why? Jean, Mom, what is happening? Is he going to be okay? I'm sorry, there's nothing more I can do. I can't believe he's gone. What did I do for this to happen to such a sweet little boy? Guys. Guys. I can't... I can't breathe. Pierre? What's wrong? What happened? I got dizzy and everything went black a second. Oh, my god. What's wrong with him? Pierre, take a big, deep breath. I'm supposed to protect him like he's supposed to protect me. It wasn't your fault, Pierre. Now, breathe with me. In... Out. In. Out. There you go. Good job. Are you feeling better? Okay. Thank you. Jean. Jean. Come on, Jean. Let's get you upstairs. This is all my fault. No, it's not your fault. This was an accident. No, I should have gone to her gravesite and talked to Nina. Mom, listen to me. There's no such thing as anything that Nina's sister or that voodoo queen were talking about. Okay? This was not your fault. This was an accident. Do you hear me? Mom? Mom. You need to get some rest. It's late. Mom? If... if only I didn't want the turtle or if I hadn't been in such a rush to be out there... if we were five minutes later the snake wouldn't have been there. Pierre, it's not your fault. I was sleeping. In the middle of the day. I never do that. It's not your fault, either. No. It's mine. It's something I've done that's caused this. Stop with this nonsense. No, no. No! Pierre? What's wrong? I was... I had a nightmare. We were all trapped underwater. Caught in these vines like in the Bayou. You're burning up. Pierre had a fever so I gave him an Aspirin. Thank you, dear. You should go to him, Mama. He called for you. I can't see him. I will not bring him any more bad luck. I have to make Jean's funeral arrangements... Why don't I make the calls while you nap and then you don't have to- Pierre! Baby, are you okay? My chest hurts. It hurts how? Like someone's sitting on it. Let's just breathe, okay? Slow, deep breaths. Come on. Come on. Pierre! Call 911. Pearl? Pearl, what's happening? Is Pierre ok? Make the call! Pearl! Pearl! Talk to me! Dad, give me the phone! Talk to me! Yes, we need an ambulance. My brother, he can't breathe. It's 10337 St. Charles Avenue. Hurry, please. He'll die now, too. Mom, the doctors will know what to do. Dr. Clark, room 103. Dr. Clark you're needed... I gave him a sedative and he should be stable for now. What's wrong with him? His heart rate is all over the place and we don't know why. He hasn't eaten since his brother died. Could it be shock? That wouldn't explain why his white blood cell count is so high. No, something else is wrong. Something physical. He played in the water in the swamp. Could it be some kind of bacteria? We'll keep running tests. Will he be able to go to his brother Jean's funeral? I'm afraid not. We need to keep him here. Housekeeping, room 301. Jean. Jean, Jean... Jean. No! It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I... I have to get ready to go. Go where? To the funeral. Pierre, it's already happened. No. No, no, no. Where's Mama? She's at home, resting. I need to go see Mama! No. Uh... can we get some help in here? We need help! Please! Excuse me, excuse me. Stand back. Check his pulse. What's going on? Charge the defibrillator. Charging. Charge. Charged. Clear! Clear. Charge. Charged. Clear! Charge. Charged. Clear! How is he? He's stable again, for now. But we still don't know what's wrong with him. Then you need to figure it out. Yeah? Pearl? What're you doing? Research. I'm trying to figure out what on earth might be going on with Pierre. It just doesn't make any sense. It does. In its own way. I'm gonna go back to the hospital. You have to come with me. Sweetheart, your brother, I... I can't. It kills me I can't see him but... he would be worse off if I did. Mom... Dr. Ganyon? I found this thing, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me but I wonder, do you think Pierre could be suffering from Broken Heart Syndrome? You think cardiac arrest is a figment of his imagination? I know it doesn't seem logical on the surface but it- No, it doesn't. But you have no other ideas, right? No. If you wanna learn more about Broken Heart Syndrome the person to talk to is a psychiatrist. They treat conditions like that. Thank you. Dr. Smith line 2. Dr. Smith line 2. Excuse me, Dr. Lefevre, you're in psychiatry, correct? Yes. Can I help you? I'm Pearl Andreas. I just have a quick question. My brother is a patient here but they don't know what's wrong. And I just read in a textbook about Broken Heart Syndrome. Is it a real ailment? Have you ever seen it? Oh, yes. First hand at the V.A. after Vietnam. Most internists wouldn't even consider it. They're so stubborn. But, after a powerful and tragic event, the body can release all kinds of stress hormones that can deregulate the entire system. Powerful and tragic event like your brother dying? That could do it. Dr. Ganyon is his internist? I'll talk to him. If you're right, a cocktail of sedatives and a medication that treats PTSD might do the trick and stabilize him. But the most important thing, this kind of stress and shock weakens the immune system. It makes a patient very vulnerable to infections so the patients need to be soothed. Soothed how? The best way is being around family and loved ones. Being around what's familiar. Psychology, pick up line 1. Psychology, pick up line 1. What are you doing? Was Mama Dede here? Yes. I hoped she could give me some answers. Right. In life, when something's wrong like this, you can't afford to rule out any possibilities, however remote. I can't let anyone else get hurt. I've already lost Jean and I can't bear the thought of anything bad happening to Pierre, your dad or you because of what I've done. Mama, even if these things are true, what could you have possibly done to have killed Jean and make Pierre sick? I don't know. There's so many things it could be. I don't have a clue which it is, but I know in my gut that Mama Dede is the one who can help me figure it out. Mom, come on. Come with me. I spoke to the doctor and- The doctors are doing their work and I'm doing mine. And tonight- Not the cemetery. I need to talk to the dead to see what forces are behind all of this. Mama, this stuff, it's ridiculous. That's what you think. Fine. If you go then I'm going, too. It's dangerous there at night. You shouldn't be alone. Meet me downstairs at 11:30. And don't tell your father. I wouldn't know how. Mom. Oh, dammit. Mama. Everything will be okay soon. What did you just do? Nina spoke to me. Because I turned my back on the past and showed pride, the curse has gained power. No, Pearl, this is real. To save Pierre I need to find out what's causing this curse, whom it's coming from, and then make amends to zap it of its power and fury. I just don't know where to start. Mama, let's get you home. So this new doctor on Pierre's case, Dr. Lefevre, she says it's too early to get our hopes up but Pierre seems to be stabilizing. Our spiritual work is helping. When I spoke to her, Dr. Lefevre said that it'd be good to have family around, and things that feel familiar. Maybe we can bring some clothing of Jean's, and some of his favorite toys. And then you can come to the hospital with us, Mama. Okay? He's getting better. You don't have to worry about this... thing now. You don't understand, Pearl, but you'll see. Dad, I'm heading back to the hospital! Okay, hon! Mama, where are you going?! No! Mama! Whoever's driving that car, stop, now! Mama's gone off in a car with some people from the Bayou. Dad, I'm really worried. What is this? It's a letter she wrote us. "As a woman of science, Pearl, "you know actions cause reactions, "and Jean's death and Pierre's illness "are the result of some action of mine in the past. "What exactly that is, I don't know... yet. "But I have to find out. "And to do that I have to open myself up to the past. "I have to go back to the Bayou and relive it. "Only then will I know what's cursing us. "And only then will I be able to atone for it." "I know you don't understand this, "but please allow me to finish my work "without coming to find me." "And if I don't return, if the fates have it, "should that I must move on from this world, "please know this. "I love you, Pierre, and your father with all my heart." What does that mean? "If I don't return." Could she be in danger? What if she sacrifices herself. You think she would do that? Dad, she's distraught and that's what she believes. We have to find her. If something happens to her... Pierre needs her. This family needs to stay together. If she's going back through her past where would she start? At the beginning. At the Landry shack. You're not actually thinking about helping her, are you? I'm gonna make sure that she's okay and that she comes back for Pierre. Dad! Come on! Let's go. Dead end. She's not here. Hard to imagine that she lived here but she did. With Paul? Until he built Cypress Woods. Do you think that she was actually in love with her half-brother? That's not something I wanna answer for her. So she was with him when she met you. They had already broken up because she found out the truth about him and how they were related. When your mom and I met we... well, it was only a short time before I was sent away. She was pregnant with you and alone and desperate, so I don't think she had a choice but to go back to Paul. She says he was trying to warn me. Warn her. I don't know. Maybe we should go to Cypress Woods next. This place has seen better days. Hey! This is private property. Belonging to Mrs. Ruby Dumas. I know. I'm John. I work for Southern Oil. I'm doing a survey here for the new wells. The company rents me an apartment in an old manor next door. Have you been here long? A couple hours. We're looking for my mom. This woman. Have you seen her? No one's come or gone that I saw. Is there any phones nearby? I need to call my wife's friends in the area. Yeah, I got one in my place. It's close. So, you're Pearl Dumas, huh? Hmm? Oh. Yes. You know who I am? Of course, your family is well-known around here. And I've been working the rigs in this parish long enough to know just about everybody. I heard about how beautiful your mother is, which I see she's passed on. Not to overstep. Just pointing out a fact. And of course your grandmére, I heard about what a talented traiteur she was and how many people she healed. So I've heard. You're planning on studying medicine, right? Word gets around here. I can tell you're gonna be a fine doctor one day. Pearl, we have to go. What's wrong? I just talked to the hospital and Pierre has taken a turn for the worse. Thank you for your help and if you see or hear anything regarding my wife please just call me at home or at Broadmoor Hospital. I sure will. Dad, look. It's Mom and Mama Dede. Poppa! Are you okay? Can you call 911? Yeah. Poppa, it's gonna be okay. It's okay. How are you feeling? Do you remember anything? Mr. Andreas, your radius and ulna are shattered. Compound fractures, which means you need surgery and hardware put in tonight. It's a lengthy operation so he'll be out the rest of the night. Dr. Jameson to ICU. Dr. Jameson to ICU. I'm so sorry. I'm failing you. I'm failing this family. Miss Andreas? Could you come with me? We need to discuss your brother. Dr. Stuartson to Ward 12. Dr. Stuartson to Ward 12. I don't understand. I thought he was recovering with the medication Dr. Lefevre gave him. He was. But, as I had feared, his immunocompromised state has left him vulnerable to a serious systemic infection. Sepsis? Exactly. The problem is, the infection he has, the bacteria is resistant to most of our antibiotics. But there's still some that can work. There is one that might work. It's an IV antibiotic that we seldom use because of the serious side effects, particularly to a patient already weakened, so it could do him more harm than good. But it's our best shot at keeping him alive and we have to move quickly, so with your mother not here and father incapacitated, I need your consent. Mine? As next of kin it's your decision whether we try it. Your call. I trust you. I'll have the nurses set up the IV. Do you still think that having family around will make him stronger? It's more important now than it ever was. Where's your mother? A mother is the closest connection for a boy of his age. She really needs to be here. I'm working on it. Excuse me. Pearl Dumas? There's a call for you. His name is John? If you want I can put it through. Hello? I saw your mother in a car. I think I know where they're headed. That's great. I'll come pick you up. Okay. My grandmére's grave. Someone must have been here. Your mom? Must be. Okay. Where next? I don't know. Your guess is as good as mine, though it's late. She has to be staying somewhere. Cypress Woods. She told my dad that she and Paul were happiest there. Okay. Let's go. Mom? Mama? This doesn't really seem like the kind of place a lady would stay. I saw pictures of this place. It used to be beautiful. Mama? She's gone. But she stopped here. Look, handprints. They must be hers, which means she might come back. I think I'm gonna stay here for tonight. Thanks for your help. Stay here? There's thieves and vandals out in these parts. What about them? It isn't safe. Okay, then I'll stick around, crash on the couch. You know, protect you. Who says I need protecting? Don't move. Hold on. How did you know for me to stop moving? They only bite in defense. When their webs are disturbed or they're scared. Thank you. Oh, no. You got it covered. No need for help from me. Scared of all the noises? No. I just don't want you to be. Are you okay? Yeah, it's just... Could we um... We could keep each other warm. Oh, okay. Morning. We should start looking again. Okay. Where to first? To see my Aunt Jeanne. This is about Paul. He is survived by his mother, Gladys, and my Aunt Jeanne. I think whatever is happening it... it has to do with them. How do you know that? It's just a gut feeling. Okay. My, my. For a second I thought you were Ruby Dumas. It's the town drunk. Let him be. He might know something. Buster Trahaw at your service. You know my mom? I worked for the family for years. So you're her daughter, huh? Yes. Have you seen her? I heard she was back in town, but I haven't seen her for a while. If you do, would you find me? With pleasure, ma'am. Oh, look who it is. Pearl, I'm so glad to see you. It's good to see you, too, Aunt Jeanne. This is John. He works for the oil company. Come on in. We just have some questions about Paul. He was in so much pain after she broke up with him. But, you know, half brother and sister, it couldn't be. But then they got back together. When your father was sent away and Gisselle, that witch, turned her against Beau, yes, she took Paul back. She used him... for comfort and support, and he knew it. Don't listen to her. She's just getting bitter with old age. Have you seen my mom? I really think that she could be in danger. She is. I know that for a fact. How? I have it on good authority that she's cursed. Owing to the fact that she killed Paul. Killed Paul? No, Pearl, do not listen to her. Paul drowned. No! She had him wrapped around her little finger so much... it... drove him to kill himself. She knows it. I gave her a little reminder. What do you mean? It was you who put that photo of Paul in the album I made. Now somebody has put a curse on her. So she'll die, too. After she loses everything and everyone she loves. If you haven't seen her how do you know that she thinks that there's a curse? Mother, what did you do? Fine, I did it. I put the hex on Ruby. And Ruby seeing that photo and remembering what she did to him, that was its beginning. Now his pain can haunt her and power my spell. She didn't do anything wrong to him. If you don't believe me, what makes you think that after all of these years, on the eve of the anniversary of his death, this isn't happening? You think it's all random? Hmm? No. The moon and the stars all the signs of heaven and hell have finally lined up the same as on that terrible day. And now the whole storm of bad Gris-Gris is gonna blow back on her. Let's get going. We're done here. You'll see. There's a storm coming. I don't know much more than you do, but after years round these Bayou superstitions I do know one thing. If Ruby believes that the curse that Mom put on her is fueled by Paul's pain then she's going to be trying to make amends with him. She'll be trying to track down his spirit and talk to it. Gladys is right about one thing. A storm's coming in. We need to call it a day, and get some place safe, okay? Okay. -Bye. -Bye. There's no big storm yet. Are you hungry? No. If there's no big storm then let's get going. Pearl, if we go out there we'll get stuck. There could be flash floods. It's not safe. And it's not letting up any time soon. Fine. When the storm passes maybe we should start with his grave first. I don't know. My aunt who was into this kind of stuff used to say that spirits don't really cling on to their graves but they're in the places they felt their pain. Pearl, I gotta insist you eat. But I got options. What options do I have? Spaghetti with tomato sauce or... spaghetti with tomato sauce. I'll have it with the sauce. Perfect. Order coming right up. Do you uh, do you like things being spicy? Pardon? Do you like spicy foods? Sometimes when I'm cooking pasta just for me I put some hot sauce in the sauce. How spicy? Not too spicy. Wanna try it? Come here. Mm-hmm. It's good. Yeah? It's okay if you don't want to. No, I want to. I've never met anyone quite like you, Pearl Dumas. I've never met anyone like you. No other oil hands with my charm? Nobody else who makes me feel safe. Wait a second. What's this? About last night... Yeah? That was my first time. Darn. I wish I could have taken you somewhere beautiful and made it more special. No. It was perfect. You made me feel things that I didn't think I was capable of. What do you mean? I was starting to think that I wasn't capable of love or passion. You are more passionate than anyone I've ever met. And you've got brains on top of it. Sometimes you just have to find something that gives those two forces their balance, you know? I think I found it. I'm late. I gotta go. One of your wells broke down. It's mine? Then I can give you the day off. Trust me, there's nothing I'd want more than to stay here with you but it wouldn't be fair to the team. I'll come back as soon as I can. Listen, be careful. Why? I don't know. This whole thing. Well, you're not believing in curses now, are you? I don't know what I believe now. What's changing your mind? Part of it... you. And what happened last night. It opened my eyes to something. That there's so much more to life than the surface. And I've seen it before, too. With Pierre. The fact that he's dying from something so inexplicable. Broken Heart Syndrome. Just, it stretches the rational mind to the point... just be careful. I'll come back as soon as I'm done with work. I'm going to stay here and read up more on the history of Cypress Woods. Maybe it will help. Okay. Buster, right? Is everything okay? No, ma'am. I found your mama. But she's in terrible shape. What? What happened? Not sure. I found her unconscious near my place on the shore of the Bayou bleeding from her head. My god. I took her back to her house and laid her on the couch but she's not waking up, and I tried the doc, but he's out of town. Can you take me to her? Just give me a sec, I'll grab my coat. Here we are. Where is she? That's what I've been asking myself for the past 20 years. I... I don't understand. You see, your great granddaddy promised me a wife. I paid for a wife. Paid for a wife? Your mama. She was about your age. Okay, look. I... I don't know everything that happened, but... All you need to know is that I'm owed a wife and I'm gonna have me one. And if it ain't gonna be Ruby it's gonna be you. Your mama was a fighter, too. Had her chained to the bedpost before she got away. But that ain't happening this time. Help! Help! Nobody around here for miles. Trust me, you ain't getting out. I built this just for you. Don't kill me! Don't make me! You know I could drain all your blood if I go a millimeter lower and deeper. Right into the jugular! Okay, easy now. Get in the cage! Okay, okay! You can't run far enough. I'll find you! I'll find you!! Hello? Hello? Please, please. Help! Pearl, Pearl, Pearl! It's me. It's me. It's me. Buster, he tried to... oh, thank god it's you. What did that man do to you? It was horrible. Did he, did he- No, no, thank god. I've been looking all over for you. Thank god you're all right. He's already got a record, so he's not getting out of jail any time soon. Good. I'm so sorry I left you there alone today. No, it's not your fault. I went with him when my gut told me not to. I should have listened to my mom. John. Look. Someone's there. It's my mom's car. Mama? Hello, dear. Mama, where have you been? Out here, trying to figure out what dark cloud is hanging over us. You've had us all worried to death. I'm sorry. I know. And I know you don't understand this, but this is the only way Pierre stands a chance. Mama, no. I do understand. Or at least I'm starting to understand that I don't understand everything. That's marvelous, sweetheart. As Grandmére Catherine used to say, that's the first step to wisdom. I just wish there was something we could do. We found out about Gladys and her- -Curse. Yes. She's riled up Paul's hatred of me and used that anger to power the hex. Hatred? But he loved you. Love is a funny thing. It sometimes turns to spite. You saw with Claude. Paul is nothing like Claude. Even Poppa said that he was kind, and that he owed him so much for selflessly taking care of us. But that was until your poppa came back. And then Paul spiraled down. I couldn't love him back the way he wanted, and... it killed him. And now, out of spite, on this night, when all the stars and the moon line up exactly the same as they did on that night, so long ago, he wants to make us feel the same pain. But it doesn't make sense. Well, you saw yourself in your dreams. No. Mama, in my dreams he was reaching out asking for help. Help? Yes. He said "help me". You have such good intuition. You have the gift. The gift? If he's asking for help then this isn't about hatred. It's about hurt. He's trapped here by his love for us and only I can set him free. How will you do that? With this painting. And Mama Dede. We need to show him what he meant to me. How can we help? Well, I'll need more light. More paints. Oh, and turpentine. It's done. Oh, my god. It looks almost exactly like how I saw him in my dreams. I painted his face from memory. What's next? We find out where Mama Dede wants to meet. We gotta get this done tonight. Time is running out. You have the painting. Let me see. Oh, Ruby. It's beautiful. Do you think it'll work? It's the spitting image of him. And what's more, your soul shines through every brush stroke. Your spirit reaching out to his through this symbol of your love. What's next? Well, now we have to give Paul another send off. A proper one this time, which in essence means we rebury him. Are you gonna dig him up? Oh no, child, not literally. That's a felony in Louisiana. We do it metaphorically now, which means your mama has to tell him goodbye, and when she does so she- I have to open up to the past. My past. And tell him the truth. That I loved him. Because I really did. And if he accepts this, if he understands this, he'll go on and let go, and the curse will be lifted. And all the bad stuff will stop happening? One hopes. But the smoke needs to rise right at midnight. Why is that? That's the time between the living and the dead. It's time. It's now or never. I'm sorry I tried to forget. I can't imagine how much that hurt you and I don't have any way to make it better except by being honest about it. I painted this to show you that I still remember every detail. I've opened my soul up to it and the fact that I loved you in some way that perhaps wasn't right, but that was nevertheless real. I loved you, Paul. I still do. But now I have to let go and so do you. I know it will be hard, but it's holding you back from where you're meant to go. From the peace you're going to have. Let me help you. Paul, my love. Go. Be free. And Paul, tell Jean what to do. Tell him to release Pierre. That they'll be together again one day when the time is right, long from now. What just happened? The past let go. Now we can move forward with the present. Pierre. My baby boy. We need to hurry. Yes. Ruby, I have to tell you something. I saw in the flicker of the flame that Pierre may not make it. What? But the curse is lifted. The curse was just the beginning of his tragedy. He lost his twin, his dearest friend to the other side. When souls are torn apart like that they hold on. They cling together. If he makes it, it's up to him now. But- But nothing. He may want to go with his brother or maybe, just maybe, he may want to stay here with you and your mom. But it's his choice now. We better go. Mom, what happened tonight... I know. So much of life is a mystery. Who knows anything, really? I don't think anyone does. But honestly, it makes things a little more exciting. Pierre, my dear. Mama's here now. I'm so very sorry for not being here earlier, but I had to make sure no more harm could come to you. We're all here now. That's right. You have me and your dad. And you may have lost your brother for now, but you have the most amazing big sister who's here, and she wants you to stay. This night is going to be tough. His system wouldn't take any more of the antibiotics so we had to take him off it. But the infection... What are his chances, doctor? I can't say. It's just going to be his body fighting to survive. Oh, he has a spirit in there. He's fighting and he's deciding. I can feel it. Excuse me, can you tell them the IV has run out? Hon, it's not up to you anymore. You have to relax. Sit. Breathe. Grandmére used to say this is the witching hour. The transitional phase between the living and the dead. This is when he'll decide. What is this thing? Where am I? What day is today? It's a good day. It's one of the best. And you have a cast. What happened? Just your dad being clumsy. But no one's signed it. You know it's a tradition to have your cast signed by someone. That's a cute poem you did on my cast there, hey? I wish Jean was here to sign it. Why don't you sign it for him? What would he say? Here. Kick me? You little prankster. I have no explanation for what happened, or how you beat the infection, Pierre. I've never seen anything like it. You're a lucky boy. And lucky to have a sister like you do. You folks take care. -Thank you. -Thank you, Doctor. Should we go? How was your first day? Thrilling. And the drive? Not bad, but ask me after another eight years. Maybe less. I found out today that I can apply for an accelerated track to finish undergrad a year earlier. You just can't wait to finish, huh? I was thinking, maybe I could practice in the Bayou. Sounds good to me. I'm a country boy at heart. And hanging up my shingle out there wouldn't be bad, like my grandmére. But you'll be a real doctor. I have no doubt that she cured plenty of people her own way. I'm sure she did. Look at that sky. Wow. Heavenly. I always wonder why you see such beautiful colors in the sky sometimes. Refraction. The angle of the sun at the end of the day as opposed to midday splits up colors into a beautiful rainbow of shades. You're just so stunning inside and out. Brains, guts, beauty. You have it all. It makes me so happy that you decided to renovate Cypress Woods, and bring it back to life. It's gonna look amazing. I love it. It will make a wonderful home for the two of you. Wow, it's really coming along, John. It's gonna look so cool. You can stay here on the weekends during the school year. And, after you graduate, if you still decide you want to practice out here. There's no other way I'd have it. I'm so glad you're making this your home. It feels like a commencement. The commencement of a new journey. I think we're gonna be okay. More than okay, dare I say it. Good.
