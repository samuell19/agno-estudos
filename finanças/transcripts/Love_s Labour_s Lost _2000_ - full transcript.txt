CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY BUENA VISTA TELEVISION [ Newsreel Narrator ] SEPTEMBER 1939. OMINOUS CLOUDS OF WAR MAY BE GATHERING OVER EUROPE, BUT HERE IN NAVARRE, THE YOUNG KING-- SEEN HERE RETURNING FROM MILITARY MANEUVERS-- HAS ANNOUNCED AN AUDACIOUS PLAN FOR HIMSELF AND HIS COURT. HE AND HIS COMPANIONS ARE TO CAST OFF THEIR MILITARY UNIFORMS... WHILE WORLD EVENTS STILL ALLOW, AND DEVOTE THEMSELVES INSTEAD... TO A RIGOROUS THREE YEARS OF STUDY. THAT'S RIGHT, THREE YEARS. THEY'LL SLEEP LITTLE, EAT AND DRINK LESS... AND DEVOTE THEMSELVES INSTEAD TO AN INSPIRING PROGRAM OF SELF-IMPROVEMENT-- A REAL FEAST FOR BOOKWORMS. BOLDEST OF ALL, PERHAPS, IS THE KING'S ABSOLUTE INSISTENCE... THAT NO WOMEN WILL BE ALLOWED INSIDE THE COURT. SORRY, LADIES, BUT HE IS THE KING. THERE IS JUST ONE EXCEPTION-- MADAME HOLOFERNIA, THE KING'S PRINCIPAL TUTOR. WITH HER ABLE ASSISTANT SIR NATHANIEL TAKING CARE OF THE MEN'S SPIRITUAL HEALTH, THEY SHOULD HAVE EVERYTHING THEY NEED... TO DISTRACT THEMSELVES FROM THOUGHTS OF ROMANCE. WHOOPS! CAREFUL, SIR. IT'S A TALL ORDER, BY GOLLY, BUT THIS ABLE YOUNG MONARCH, ONE OF EUROPE'S MOST ELIGIBLE ROYAL BACHELORS, SEEMS DETERMINED TO SHOW THE WORLD THERE'S MORE TO LIFE THAN GUNS AND WARFARE. HE'S AN IDEALIST, BUT WE WISH HIM AND HIS THREE CHUMS THE BEST. WE'LL BRING YOU MORE NEWS AS THE ADVENTURE UNFOLDS, BUT FOR NOW WE WISH THEM BON VOYAGE AND GOOD LUCK. YOU THREE-- BEROWNE, DUMAINE... AND LONGAVILLE... HAVE SWORN FOR THREE YEARS TERM TO LIVE WITH ME, MY FELLOW SCHOLARS, AND TO KEEP THOSE STATUTES THAT ARE RECORDED... IN THIS... SCHEDULE HERE. YOUR OATHS ARE PASSED, AND NOW SUBSCRIBE YOUR NAMES... THAT HIS OWN HAND MAY STRIKE HIS HONOR DOWN... THAT VIOLATES THE SMALLEST BRANCH HEREIN. IF YOU ARE ARMED TO DO... AS SWORN TO DO, SUBSCRIBE TO YOUR DEEP OATHS... AND KEEP IT, TOO. I AM RESOLVED. 'TIS BUT A THREE YEARS' FAST. THE MIND SHALL BANQUET... THOUGH THE BODY PINE. TO LOVE, TO WEALTH, TO POMP I PINE AND DIE, WITH ALL THESE LIVING IN PHILOSOPHY. SO MUCH, DEAR LIEGE, I HAVE ALREADY SWORN-- THAT IS, TO LIVE AND STUDY HERE THREE YEARS. BUT THERE ARE OTHER STRICT OBSERVANCES AS NOT TO SEE A WOMAN IN THAT TERM, AND ONE DAY IN A WEEK TO TOUCH NO FOOD... AND BUT ONE MEAL ON EVERY DAY BESIDES, AND THEN TO SLEEP BUT THREE HOURS IN THE NIGHT AND NOT BE SEEN TO YAWN OF ALL THE DAY? OH. THESE ARE BARREN TASKS, TOO HARD TO KEEP-- NOT TO SEE LADIES, STUDY, FAST, NOT SLEEP. YOUR OATH IS PASSED TO PASS AWAY FROM THESE. LET ME SAY NO, MY LIEGE, AND IF YOU PLEASE, I ONLY SWORE TO STUDY WITH YOUR GRACE... AND STAY HERE IN YOUR COURT FOR THREE YEARS' SPACE. YOU SWORE TO THAT, BEROWNE, AND TO THE REST. BY YEA AND NAY, SIR. THEN I HAD SWORE IN JEST. WHAT IS THE END OF STUDY, LET ME KNOW? WHY, THAT TO KNOW WHICH ELSE WE SHOULD NOT KNOW. THINGS HID AND BARRED, YOU MEAN, FROM COMMON SENSE? AYE, THAT IS STUDY'S GOD-LIKE RECOMPENSE. AS THUS-- TO STUDY WHERE I WELL MAY DINE... WHEN I TO FEAST EXPRESSLY AM FORBID, OR STUDY WHERE TO MEET SOME MISTRESS FINE... WHEN MISTRESSES FROM COMMON SENSE ARE HID. THESE BE THE STOPS THAT HINDER STUDY QUITE... AND TRAIN OUR INTELLECTS TO VAIN DELIGHT. WHY, ALL DELIGHTS ARE VAIN. * I'VE SEEN FOR DAYS THAT YOU'VE GOT SOME WAYS THAT MUST BE CHECKED * * IN YOU I NEVER CAN DETECT * * THE SLIGHTEST SIGN OF INTELLECT * * YOUR MADAM DANCES THINK OF THE CHANCES YOU NEGLECT * * YOU NEVER SEEM INCLINED TO USE YOUR MIND * * YOU'RE JUST A FELLA WHO * * HAS GOT HIS BRAINS IN HIS DANCING SHOES * * TAKE A LESSON FROM ME * * I'D RATHER CHARLESTON * DO-DO, DO-DO * DO-DO, DO-DO * THINK OF WHAT YOU MIGHT BE * * I'D RATHER CHARLESTON * DO-DO, DO-DO * DO-DO, DO-DO * I'M DISAPPOINTED IN YOU AND YOUR WAYS * * I'M DOUBLE-JOINTED * THERE'S NO SENSATION LIKE SYNCOPATION * * WILL YOU LET ME KNOW WHY * * I'D RATHER CHARLESTON * CHARLESTON ? * THAT'S THE SORT OF THING I WOULD NEVER DO, SO * * LEAVE IT BEHIND AND GIVE YOUR MIND TO SOMETHING NEW * * I'D RATHER CHARLESTON CHARLESTON, CHARLESTON * * CHARLESTON CHARLESTON WITH YOU * WELL, SIT YOU OUT. GO HOME, BEROWNE. ADIEU. NO, MY GOOD LORD. I HAVE SWORN TO STAY WITH YOU. [ Berowne ] BUT THERE ARE OTHER STRICT OBSERVANCES. "THAT NO WOMAN SHALL COME WITHIN A MILE OF MY COURT." HATH THIS BEEN PROCLAIMED? FOUR DAYS AGO. LET'S SEE THE PENALTY. "ON PAIN OF LOSING HER TONGUE." WHO DEVISED THIS PENALTY? MARRY, THAT DID I. SWEET LORD, AND WHY? WELL, TO FRIGHT THEM HENCE WITH THE DREAD PENALTY. A DANGEROUS LAW AGAINST GENTILITY. "ITEM: IF ANY MAN BE SEEN TO TALK WITH A WOMAN WITHIN THE TERM OF THREE YEARS, "HE SHALL ENDURE SUCH PUBLIC SHAME AS THE REST OF THE COURT... CAN POSSIBLE DEVISE." THIS ARTICLE, MY LIEGE, YOURSELF MUST BREAK, FOR WELL-- YOU KNOW, HERE COMES IN EMBASSY THE FRENCH KING'S DAUGHTER... WITH YOURSELF TO SPEAK, A MAID OF GRACE AND COMPLETE MAJESTY... ABOUT SURRENDER UP OF AQUITANE TO HER DECREPIT, SICK AND BEDRID FATHER. THEREFORE, THIS ARTICLE IS MADE IN VAIN, OR VAINLY COMES THE ADMIRED PRINCESS HITHER. AH! AH! WHAT SAY YOU, LORDS? WHY, THIS WAS QUITE FORGOT. WE MUST OF FORCE DISPENSE WITH THIS DECREE. SHE MUST LIE HERE ON MERE... NECESSITY. NECESSITY WILL MAKE US ALL FORSWORN 3,000 TIMES... WITHIN THIS THREE YEARS SPACE, FOR EVERY MAN WITH HIS AFFECTS IS BORN, NOT BY MIGHT MASTERED, BUT BY SPECIAL GRACE. IF I BREAK FAITH, THIS WORD SHALL SPEAK FOR ME. I AM FORSWORN ON MERE NECESSITY. SO, TO THE LAWS AT LARGE, I WRITE MY NAME AND HE THAT BREAKS THEM IN THE LEAST DEGREE... STANDS IN ATTAINDER... OF ETERNAL SHAME. SUGGESTIONS ARE TO OTHERS AS TO ME, BUT I BELIEVE-- ALTHOUGH I SEEM SO LOATH-- I AM THE LAST THAT WILL LAST... BREAK HIS OATH. GOOD BOYET, YOU ARE NOT IGNORANT ALL-TELLING FAME. DOTH NOISE ABROAD NAVARRE HATH MADE A VOW... TILL PAINFUL STUDY SHALL OUTWEAR THREE YEARS, NO WOMAN MAY APPROACH HIS SILENT COURT. THEREFORE, TO US IT SEEMETH A NEEDFUL COURSE, BEFORE WE ENTER HIS FORBIDDEN GATES, TO KNOW HIS PLEASURE, AND IN THAT BEHALF, BOLD OF YOUR WORTHINESS, WE SINGLE YOU AS OUR BEST-MOVING FAIR SOLICITOR. TELL HIM THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF FRANCE, ON SERIOUS BUSINESS, CRAVING QUICK DISPATCH... IMPORTUNES PERSONAL CONFERENCE WITH HIS GRACE. PROUD OF EMPLOYMENT, WILLINGLY I GO. ALL PRIDE IS WILLING PRIDE, AND YOURS IS SO. [ Chuckles ] WHO ARE THE VOTARIES, MY LOVING MAIDS, THAT ARE VOW-FELLOWS WITH THIS VIRTUOUS DUKE? LORD LONGAVILLE IS ONE. KNOW YOU THE MAN? I KNOW HIM, MADAM. AT A MARRIAGE FEAST IN NORMANDY SAW I THIS LONGAVILLE. WHO ARE THE REST? THE YOUNG DUMAINE. I SAW HIM AT THE DUKE ALENCON'S ONCE. ANOTHER OF THESE STUDENTS AT THAT TIME WAS THERE WITH HIM, IF I HAVE HEARD A TRUTH. BEROWNE THEY CALL HIM. GOD BLESS MY LADIES, ARE THEY ALL IN LOVE? [ All Chuckling ] HERE COMES BOYET! WHAT ADMITTANCE, LORD? NAVARRE HAD NOTICE OF YOUR FAIR APPROACH, AND HE AND HIS COMPETITORS IN OATH... WERE ALL ADDRESSED TO MEET YOU, GENTLE LADY, BEFORE I CAME. MARRY, THUS MUCH HAVE I LEARNED.

THE ROOF OF THIS COURT IS TOO HIGH TO BE YOURS, AND WELCOME TO THE WIDE FIELDS TOO BASE TO BE MINE. YOU SHALL BE WELCOME, MADAM, TO MY COURT. I WILL BE WELCOME THEN. CONDUCT ME THITHER. HEAR ME, DEAR LADY. I HAVE SWORN AN OATH. OUR LADY, HELP MY LORD. HE'LL BE FORSWORN. NOT FOR THE WORLD, FAIR MADAM, BY MY WILL. WHY, WILL SHALL BREAK IT. WILL AND NOTHING ELSE. YOUR LADYSHIP IS IGNORANT WHAT IT IS. WERE MY LORD SO HIS IGNORANCE WERE WISE. 'TIS DEADLY SIN TO KEEP THAT OATH, MY LORD, AND SIN TO BREAK IT. AHH! BUT PARDON ME. I AM TOO SUDDEN BOLD...

MADAM, YOUR FATHER HERE DOTH INTIMATE THE PAYMENT OF A 100,000 CROWNS, BEING BUT THE ONE HALF OF AN ENTIRE SUM... DISPERSED BY MY FATHER IN HIS WARS. BUT SAY THAT HE OR WE AS NEITHER HAVE... RECEIVED THAT SUM, YET THERE REMAINS UNPAID A 100,000 MORE. YOU DO THE KING, MY FATHER, TOO MUCH WRONG... AND WRONG THE REPUTATION OF YOUR NAME... IN SO UNSEEMING TO CONFESS RECEIPT OF THAT WHICH HATH SO FAITHFULLY BEEN PAID. I DO PROTEST I NEVER HEARD OF IT, AND IF YOU PROVE IT, I'LL REPAY IT BACK OR YIELD UP AQUITANE. WE ARREST YOUR WORD. BOYET, YOU CAN PRODUCE ACQUITTANCES FOR SUCH A SUM. SATISFY ME SO. [ Boyet ] SO PLEASE YOUR GRACE, THE PACKET IS NOT COME WHERE THAT AND OTHER SPECIALTIES ARE BOUND. TOMORROW YOU SHALL HAVE A SIGHT OF THEM. IT SHALL SUFFICE ME. MEANTIME, RECEIVE SUCH WELCOME... AT MY HAND AS HONOR... WITHOUT BREACH OF HONOR MAY MAKE TENDER OF TO THY TRUE WORTHINESS. YOU MAY NOT COME, FAIR PRINCESS, WITHIN MY GATES. BUT HERE WITHOUT, YOU SHALL BE SO RECEIVED AS YOU SHALL DEEM YOURSELF... LODGED IN MY HEART. TOMORROW SHALL WE VISIT YOU AGAIN? DID NOT I DANCE WITH YOU IN BRABANT ONCE? DID NOT I DANCE WITH YOU IN BRABANT ONCE? I KNOW YOU DID. HOW NEEDLESS WAS IT THEN TO AS THE QUESTION? * I WON'T DANCE DON'T ASK ME * * I WON'T DANCE DON'T ASK ME * * I WON'T DANCE, MONSIEUR, WITH YOU * * MY HEART WON'T LET MY FEET DO THINGS * * THEY SHOULD DO * YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE LOVELY * * AND SO WHAT I'M LOVELY * * BUT OH WHAT YOU DO TO ME * * I'M LIKE AN OCEAN WAVE THAT'S BUMPED ON THE SHORE * * I FEEL SO ABSOLUTELY STUMPED ON THE FLOOR * * WHEN YOU DANCE YOU'RE CHARMING AND YOU'RE GENTLE * * ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU DO THE CONTINENTAL * * BUT THIS FEELING ISN'T PURELY MENTAL * * FOR HEAVEN REST US I'M NOT ASBESTOS * * AND THAT'S WHY [ Women ] * I WON'T DANCE WHY SHOULD I * * I WON'T DANCE HOW COULD I * * I WON'T DANCE MERCI BEAUCOUP * * I KNOW THAT MUSIC LEADS THE WAY TO ROMANCE * * SO IF I HOLD YOU IN MY ARMS * * I WON'T DANCE [ Ladies Giggling ] [ Boyet ] IF MY OBSERVATION, WHICH VERY SELDOM LIES... BY THE HEART'S STILL RHETORIC DISCLOSED WITH EYES DECEIVE ME NOT NOW, NAVARRE IS INFECTED. WITH WHAT? WITH THAT WHICH WE LOVERS ENTITLE "AFFECTED." YOUR REASON? HIS FACE'S OWN MARGIN DID QUOTE SUCH AMAZES... THAT ALL I SAW HIS EYES ENCHANTED WITH GAZES. I'LL GIVE YOU AQUITANE AND ALL THAT IS HIS... AND YOU GIVE HIM FOR MY SAKE BUT ONE LOVING KISS. [ All Laughing ] COME TO OUR PAVILION. BOYET IS DISPOSED! BUT TO SPEAK THAT IN WORDS WHICH HIS EYE HATH DISCLOSED. I ONLY HAVE MADE A MOUTH OF HIS EYE BY ADDING A TONGUE, WHICH I KNOW WILL NOT LIE. THOU ART AN OLD LOVE-MONGER, AND SPEAKEST SKILLFULLY! DO YOU HEAR, MY MAD WENCHES? NO! WHAT THEN, DO YOU SEE? AYE. OUR WAY TO BE GONE. YOU ARE TOO HARD FOR ME. [ Newsreel Announcer ] ROYALS CAMPING. THE PRINCESS OF FRANCE ENJOYS AN UNEXPECTED TASTE OF THE OUTDOORS TONIGHT. ALL WOMEN ARE BANNED FROM THE COURT OF NAVARRE, AND HER ROYAL HIGHNESS IS NO EXCEPTION. IT MEANS A NIGHT UNDER CANVAS FOR THE LADIES. THE KING'S PROCLAMATION CONTINUES TO MAKE LIFE TRICKY FOR THE PEOPLE OF NAVARRE. UH-OH, THERE'S TROUBLE AFOOT. LOOK AT THIS MOTLEY CREW. THEY'RE LED BY THE FANTASTICAL SPANIARD, DON ARMADO. HIS HEART MAY BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE, BUT HIS LANGUAGE IS ALL OVER THE PLACE. LOYALLY HE FOLLOWS THE KING. IT'S JUST UNFORTUNATE... THAT WHEN HE SPEAKS, THE KING CAN'T ALWAYS FOLLOW ARMADO. THANK GOODNESS FOR HIS TRUSTY PAGE, THE STRANGELY NAMED MOTH. THESE TWO SEEM TO HAVE BROUGHT A CRIMINAL TO BOOK. AND I'LL WAGER IF THERE'S TROUBLE IN STORE, THAT RASCAL COSTARD IS INVOLVED. HE'S THE KING'S RESIDENT COMEDIAN. THIS CHEEKY CHAPPIE HAS PLAYED THE VAUDEVILLE HOUSES FROM BROADWAY TO BADEN BADEN. HE'S ALSO BEEN KNOWN TO PLAY FAST AND LOOSE WITH THE LADIES. WATCH OUT, GIRLS. WHATEVER THE PROBLEM, THE KING CAN ALWAYS RELY ON HIS LOCAL BOBBY. CONSTABLE DULL ALWAYS GETS HIS MAN, OR IN THIS CASE, SOMETHING RATHER DIFFERENT, IF THAT PAPER BAG IS HIDING WHAT WE THINK IT IS. IN ANY CASE, IT'S ANOTHER HEADACHE FOR THE KING. LET THE TRIAL BEGIN. AHEM. [ Whistles ] THE MATTER IS TO ME, SIR, AS CONCERNING JAQUENETTA. [ Honking Sound ] THE MANNER OF IT IS, I WAS TAKEN WITH THE MANNER. IN WHAT MANNER? AHH! IN MANNER AND FORM FOLLOWING, SIR. I WAS, UH, SEEN WITH HER IN THE MANOR HOUSE, SITTING WITH HER UPON THE FORM, AND TAKEN FOLLOWING HER INTO THE PARK, WHICH, PUT TOGETHER, IS IN MANNER AND FORM FOLLOWING. FROM THE WEST CORNER OF THY CURIOUS KNOTTED GARDEN. THERE DID I SEE THAT LOW-SPIRITED SWAIN... THE BASE MINNOW OF THY MIRTH, ME? THAT UNLETTERED, SMALL-KNOWING SOUL, ME? THAT SHALLOW VESSEL, STILL ME? WHICH, AS I REMEMBER, IS COSTARD! OH, ME. SORTED AND CONSORTED, CONTRARY TO THY ESTABLISHED PROCLAIMED EDICT AND CONTINENT CANON, WITH-- WITH-- O, WITH BUT WITH THIS I PASSION TO SAY WHEREWITH! WITH A WENCH.

BY THY GOOD GRACE'S OFFICER ANTHONY DULL, A MAN OF GOOD REPUTE, COURAGE, BEARING AND ESTIMATION. O, ME. I AM DULL. FOR JAQUENETTA SO... IS THE WEAKER VESSEL CALLED WHICH I APPREHENDED... WITH THE AFORESAID SWAIN. I KEEP HER AS A VESSEL OF THY LAW'S FURY... AND SHALL AT THE LEAST OF THY SWEET NOTICE BRING HER TO TRIAL. THINE IN ALL COMPLIMENTS... OF DEVOTED AND HEART-BURNING HEAT OF DUTY... DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO! SIRRAH, WHAT SAY YOU TO THIS? SIR, I-- I-- [ Laughs ] I-- WHOA! I CONFESS THE WENCH. DID YOU HEAR THE PROCLAMATION? I DO CONFESS MUCH OF THE HEARING IT, BUT LITTLE OF THE MARKING OF IT. IT WAS PROCLAIMED A YEAR'S IMPRISONMENT TO BE TAKEN WITH A WENCH. I WAS TAKEN WITH NONE, SIR. I WAS TAKEN WITH A DAMSEL. WELL, IT WAS PROCLAIMED DAMSEL. THIS WAS NO DAMSEL, NEITHER, SIR. SHE WAS A VIRGIN. IT IS SO VARIED TOO, FOR IT WAS PROCLAIMED A VIRGIN. IF IT WERE, I DENY HER VIRGINITY. I WAS TAKEN WITH A MAID. THIS MAID WILL NOT SERVE YOUR TURN, SIR. THIS MAID WILL SERVE MY TURN, SIR. [ Blows Whistle ] [ Grunts ] SIR... I WILL PRONOUNCE YOUR SENTENCE. YOU SHALL FAST A WEEK WITH BRAN AND WATER. I'D RATHER PRAY A MONTH WITH MUTTON AND PORRIDGE. AND DON ARMADO SHALL BE YOUR KEEPER.

OF DUN ADRAMA, DUN ADRAMA-- DON ARBNAR-- CARBONARA-- THE DON. [ Whimpering ] HOW NOW, WHAT IS IN YOU? WHY DOST THOU TEAR IT? A TOY, MY LIEGE, A TOY. YOUR GRACE NEED NOT FEAR IT. IT DID MOVE HIM TO PASSION, AND THEREFORE LET'S HEAR IT! [ Grunting ] IT IS BEROWNE'S WRITING. [ Grunts ] AND HERE IS HIS NAME! AAH! YOU WHORESON LOGGERHEAD, YOU WERE BORN TO DO ME SHAME! GUILTY, MY LORD, GUILTY! I CONFESS. I CONFESS. WHAT? THAT YOU THREE FOOLS LACKED ME TO MAKE UP THE MESS. HE, HE AND YOU, E'EN YOU, MY LIEGE AND I... ARE PICKPURSES IN LOVE AND WE DESERVE TO DIE. [ Laughs ] OH, DISMISS THIS AUDIENCE AND I SHALL TELL YOU MORE. NOW THE NUMBER IS EVEN. TRUE, TRUE. WE ARE FOUR. WILL THESE TURTLES BE GONE? HENCE. SIRS, AWAY. WALK ASIDE THE TRUE FOLK AND LET THE TRAITORS STAY. [ Giggles ] [ Rhythmic Foot Tapping ] [ Rhythmic Foot Tapping ] HAVE AT YOU THEN AFFECTION'S MEN-AT-ARMS. CONSIDER WHAT YOU FIRST DID SWEAR UNTO. TO FAST. TO STUDY. AND TO SEE NO WOMAN. FLAT TREASON 'GAINST THE KINGLY STATE OF YOUTH. SAY, CAN YOU FAST? YOUR STOMACHS ARE TOO YOUNG... AND ABSTINENCE ENGENDERS MALADIES. FOR WHEN WOULD YOU, MY LIEGE, OR YOU, OR YOU, HAVE FOUND THE GROUND OF STUDY'S EXCELLENCE? WITHOUT THE BEAUTY OF A WOMAN'S FACE, FROM WOMAN'S EYES THIS DOCTRINE I DERIVE. THEY ARE THE GROUND, THE BOOKS, THE ACADEMES... FROM WHENCE DOTH SPRING THE TRUE PROMETHEAN FIRE. O WE HAVE MADE A VOW TO STUDY, LORDS, AND IN THAT VOW, WE HAVE FORSWORN OUR BOOKS. FOR WHEN WOULD YOU, MY LIEGE, OR YOU, OR YOU, IN LEADEN CONTEMPLATION HAVE FOUND OUT... SUCH FIERY NUMBERS AS THE PROMPTING EYES... OF BEAUTY'S TUTORS HAVE ENRICHED YOU WITH. OTHER SLOW ARTS ENTIRELY KEEP THE BRAIN, AND THEREFORE FINDING BARREN PRACTICERS... SCARCE SHOW A HARVEST OF THEIR HEAVY TOIL. BUT LOVE, FIRST LEARNED IN A LADY'S EYES, LIVES NOT ALONE IMMURED IN THE BRAIN, BUT WITH THE MOTION OF ALL ELEMENTS. COURSES AS SWIFT AS THOUGHT IN EVERY POWER, AND GIVES TO EVERY POWER A DOUBLE POWER... ABOVE THEIR FUNCTIONS AND THEIR OFFICES. IT ADDS A PRECIOUS SEEING TO THE EYE. A LOVER'S EYES WILL GAZE AN EAGLE BLIND. A LOVER'S EAR WILL HEAR THE LOWEST SOUND. LOVE'S FEELING IS MORE SOFT AND SENSIBLE... THAN ARE THE TENDER HORNS OF COCKLED SNAILS. LOVE'S TONGUE PROVES DAINTY BACCHUS GROSS IN TASTE. FOR VALOUR IS NOT LOVE A HERCULES, STILL CLIMBING TREES IN THE HESPERIDES. SUBTLE AS SPHINX, AS SWEET AND MUSICAL, AS BRIGHT APOLLO'S LUTE STRUNG WITH HIS HAIR. AND WHEN LOVE SPEAKS, THE VOICE OF ALL THE GODS... MAKE HEAVEN DROWSY WITH THE HARMONY. * HEAVEN I'M IN HEAVEN * * AND MY HEART BEATS SO * THAT I CAN HARDLY SPEAK * AND I SEEM TO FIND * THE HAPPINESS I SEEK * WHEN WE'RE OUT TOGETHER * DANCING CHEEK TO CHEEK * HEAVEN * I'M IN HEAVEN * AND THE CARES THAT HANG AROUND ME THROUGH THE WEEK * * SEEM TO VANISH LIKE A GAMBLER'S LUCKY STREAK * * WHEN WE'RE OUT TOGETHER DANCING CHEEK TO CHEEK * * [ Instrumental Continues ] * DANCE WITH ME * I WANT MY ARM ABOUT YOU * AND THE CHARM ABOUT YOU * WILL CARRY ME THROUGH * TO HEAVEN * I'M IN HEAVEN * AND MY HEART BEATS SO THAT I CAN HARDLY SPEAK * * AND I SEEM TO FIND THE HAPPINESS I SEEK * * WHEN WE'RE OUT TOGETHER DANCING CHEEK TO CHEEK * * HEAVEN [ Men ] * I'M IN HEAVEN * AND MY HEART BEATS SO THAT I CAN HARDLY SPEAK * * AND I SEEM TO FIND THE HAPPINESS I SEEK * * WHEN WE'RE OUT TOGETHER DANCING CHEEK TO CHEEK * SHALL WE... RESOLVE TO WOO THESE GIRLS OF FRANCE? AND WIN THEM TOO? THEREFORE, LET US DEVISE SOME ENTERTAINMENT FOR THEM IN THEIR TENTS. FIRST, FROM THE PARK, LET US CONDUCT THEM THITHER. THEN, HOMEWARD, EVERY MAN ATTACH THE HAND OF HIS FAIR MISTRESS. IN THE AFTERNOON, WE WILL WITH SOME STRANGE PASTIME, SOLACE THEM, SUCH AS THE SHORTNESS OF THE TIME CAN SHAPE. FOR REVELS, DANCES, MASQUES AND MERRY HOURS... FORERUN FAIR LOVE, STREWING HER WAY WITH FLOWERS. AWAY, AWAY! NO TIME SHALL BE OMITTED... THAT WILL BE TIME AND MAY BY US BE FITTED. YES! [ Newsreader ] WHILE THE REST OF EUROPE BRACES ITSELF FOR IMMINENT CATASTROPHE, HERE IN NAVARRE, ALL SEEMS QUIET. RUMORS ABOUND THAT THE KING'S OATH MAY HAVE BEEN BROKEN BY MORE THAN A FEW OF THE NATIVES. NOT MUCH EVIDENCE OF STUDY, THAT'S FOR SURE. HELLO? WHAT'S HE UP TO? DISCUSSING WHAT TO DO IN THE BLACKOUT, PERHAPS? AND WHAT ABOUT THESE MYSTERY GIFTS? THE PRINCESS AND HER LADIES SEEM TO HAVE HAD A VISIT FROM THE POSTMAN. LOVE LETTERS? SURELY THE KING'S MEN CAN'T BE INVOLVED. RUMORS TOO OF A GALA ENTERTAINMENT FOR THIS VERY EVENING. WAS SINGING AND DANCING INCLUDED IN THE OATH? I DON'T THINK SO. BUT IF THE KING PLANS A PARTY, THEN EVERYONE MUST FOLLOW. AND WHO BETTER TO ARRANGE AN EXOTIC NIGHT... THAN AN EXOTIC KNIGHT, ARMADO'S YOUR MAN. AND WITH THE HELPFUL HAND OF HOLOFERNIA... HEAVING THE HURRAHS INTO A HEAVEN OF HYSTERICAL FUN, WHO KNOWS WHAT THESE REVELLERS WILL DREAM UP ? [ Quiet Applause ] AHH! - [ Woman ] BRAVO! - SWEETHEARTS, WE SHALL BE RICH ERE WE DEPART. LOOK YOU WHAT I HAVE FROM THE LOVING KING. BUT, ROSALINE, YOU HAVE A FAVOR TOO. WHO SENT IT? AND WHAT IS IT? NAY, I HAVE VERSES TOO. I THANK BEROWNE. O HE HATH DRAWN MY PICTURE IN HIS LETTER. ANYTHING LIKE? [ All ] OH! BUT, KATHERINE, WHAT WAS SENT TO YOU FROM FAIR DUMAINE? MADAM, THIS GLOVE. THIS AND THESE PEARLS TO ME SENT LONGAVILLE. OH, WE ARE WISE GIRLS TO MOCK OUR LOVERS SO. THEY ARE WORSE FOOLS TO PURCHASE MOCKING SO. HERE COMES BOYET, AND MIRTH IS IN HIS FACE. ARM, WENCHES, ARM. ENCOUNTERS MOUNTED ARE AGAINST YOUR PEACE. LOVE DOTH APPROACH DISGUISED, ARMED IN ARGUMENTS. OH, YOU'LL BE SURPRISED. UNDER THE COOL SHADE OF A SYCAMORE, I THOUGHT TO CLOSE MINE EYES SOME HALF AN HOUR, WHEN LO, TO INTERRUPT MY PURPOSED REST, TOWARD THAT SHADE I MIGHT BEHOLD ADDRESSED THE KING... [ Women Squeal ] AND HIS COMPANIONS. WARILY, I STOLE INTO A NEIGHBOR THICKET BY... AND OVERHEARD WHAT YOU SHALL OVERHEAR, THAT BY AND BY DISGUISED, THEY WILL BE HERE. [ Shrieks ] THEIR HERALD IS A PRETTY KNAVISH PAGE. BUT WHAT-- BUT WHAT COME THEY TO VISIT US? THEY DO. THEY DO. AND ARE APPARELLED THUS, LIKE, MASKED DELIGHTS OR REVELLERS, AS I GUESS. THEIR PURPOSE IS TO PARLEY, COURT AND DANCE. AND EVERY ONE HIS LOVE-SUIT WILL ADVANCE UNTO HIS SEVERAL MISTRESS, WHICH THEY'LL KNOW BY FAVORS SEVERAL, WHICH THEY DID BESTOW. AND WILL THEY SO? THE GALLANTS SHALL BE TASKED. FOR, LADIES, WE WILL EVERY ONE BE MASKED. AND NOT A MAN OF THEM SHALL HAVE THE GRACE, DESPITE OF SUIT, TO SEE A LADY'S FACE. HOLD, TAKE THOU THIS, MY SWEET, AND GIVE ME THINE. SO SHALL BEROWNE TAKE ME FOR ROSALINE. AND YOU CHANGE YOUR FAVORS TOO... SO SHALL YOUR LOVES WOO CONTRARY, DECEIVED BY THESE REMOVES. COME ON, THEN. WEAR THE FAVORS MOST IN SIGHT. BUT IN THIS CHANGING, WHAT IS YOUR INTENT? THE EFFECT OF MY INTENT IS TO CROSS THEIRS. THEY DO IT BUT IN MOCKERY-MERRIMENT, AND MOCK FOR MOCK IS ONLY MY INTENT. * [ Piano ] THE TONGUES OF MOCKING WENCHES ARE AS KEEN AS IS THE RAZOR'S EDGE INVISIBLE, CUTTING A SMALLER HAIR THAN MAY BE SEEN. [ Boyet ] BY CHANGING PARTNERS FOR THE MASQUERADE, THEY'LL UNDERMINE THE GENTLEMEN'S CHARADE. [ Rosaline ] * THERE MAY BE TROUBLE AHEAD * * BUT WHILE THERE'S MOONLIGHT AND MUSIC AND LOVE AND ROMANCE * * LET'S FACE THE MUSIC AND DANCE * * BEFORE THE FIDDLERS HAVE FLED * * BEFORE THEY ASK US TO PAY THE BILL * * AND WHILE WE STILL HAVE THE CHANCE * * LET'S FACE THE MUSIC AND DANCE * * SOON WE'LL BE WITHOUT THE MOON * * HUMMING A DIFFERENT TUNE AND THEN * * THERE MAY BE TEARDROPS TO SHED * * SO WHILE THERE'S MOONLIGHT AND MUSIC AND LOVE AND ROMANCE * * LET'S FACE THE MUSIC AND DANCE, DANCE * * LET'S FACE THE MUSIC AND DANCE * * [ Instrumental Continues ] * SOON WE'LL BE WITHOUT THE MOON * * HUMMING A DIFFERENT TUNE AND THEN * * THERE MAY BE TEARDROPS TO SHED * * SO WHILE THERE'S MOONLIGHT AND MUSIC AND LOVE AND ROMANCE * * LET'S FACE THE MUSIC AND DANCE, DANCE * * LET'S FACE THE MUSIC AND DANCE * ARE THESE THE BREED OF WITS SO WONDERED AT ? BUT WILL YOU HEAR? THE KING IS MY LOVE SWORN. AND QUICK BEROWNE HATH PLIGHTED FAITH TO ME. AND LONGAVILLE WAS FOR MY SERVICE BORN. DUMAINE IS MINE, AS SURE AS BARK ON TREE. MADAM AND PRETTY MISTRESSES, GIVE EAR. IMMEDIATELY THEY WILL AGAIN BE HERE IN THEIR OWN SHAPES. FOR IT CAN NEVER BE, THEY WILL DIGEST THIS HARSH INDIGNITY. WILL THEY RETURN? O THEY WILL, THEY WILL. GOD KNOWS. AVAUNT, PERPLEXITY. WHAT SHALL WE DO IF THEY RETURN IN THEIR OWN SHAPES TO WOO? GOOD, MADAM, IF BY ME YOU'LL BE ADVISED. LET'S MOCK THEM STILL, AS WELL KNOWN AS DISGUISED. LET US COMPLAIN TO THEM WHAT FOOLS WERE HERE. LADIES, WITHDRAW. THE GALLANTS ARE AT HAND. [ Women Scream ] [ Chattering ] * [ Piano ] FAIR, SIR, GOD SAVE YOU. WHERE'S THE-- WHERE'S THE PRINCESS? GONE, TO HER TENT. AH. PLEASE IT, YOUR MAJESTY, COMMAND ME ANY SERVICE TO HER THITHER. THAT SHE VOUCHSAFE ME AUDIENCE FOR ONE WORD. I WILL AND SO WILL SHE. I KNOW, MY LORD. [ All Giggling ] WE CAME TO VISIT YOU AND PURPOSE NOW TO LEAD YOU TO OUR COURT. - VOUCHSAFE IT, THEN. - NOW BY MY MAIDEN HONOR, YET AS PURE AS THE UNSULLIED LILY, I PROTEST A WORLD OF TORMENTS THOUGH I SHOULD ENDURE. I WOULD NOT YIELD TO BE YOUR HOUSE'S GUEST. SO MUCH I HATE A BREAKING CAUSE TO BE OF HEAVENLY OATHS, VOWED WITH INTEGRITY. OH. YOU HAVE LIVED IN DESOLATION HERE. UNSEEN, UNVISITED, MUCH TO OUR SHAME. NOT SO, MY LORD. IT IS NOT SO, I SWEAR. WE HAVE HAD PASTIMES HERE AND PLEASANT GAME. HOW, MADAM? IN TRUTH, MY LORD. TRIM GALLANTS, FULL OF COURTSHIP AND OF STATE. MADAM SPEAK TRUE. HERE THEY STAYED AN HOUR AND TALKED APACE. AND IN THAT HOUR, MY LORD, THEY DID NOT BLESS US WITH ONE HAPPY WORD. - WHICH OF THE VISORS WAS IT THAT YOU WORE? - WHERE? WHEN? WHAT VISORS? WHY DEMAND YOU THIS? THERE, THEN, THAT VISOR, THAT SUPERFLUOUS CASE, THAT HID THE WORSE AND SHOWED THE BETTER FACE. WE WERE DESCRIED. THEY'LL MOCK US NOW. DOWNRIGHT. LET US CONFESS AND TURN IT TO A JEST. AMAZED, MY LORD? WHY LOOKS YOUR HIGHNESS SAD? WHY LOOK YOU PALE? I SEE THE TRICK. HERE WAS A CONSENT. KNOWING AFOREHAND OF OUR MERRIMENT, TO DASH IT LIKE A CHRISTMAS COMEDY. SOME CARRY-TALE, SOME PLEASE-MAN, SOME SLIGHT ZANY, SOME MUMBLE-NEWS, SOME TRENCHER-KNIGHT, SOME DICK. [ Women Giggling ] THAT SMILES HIS CHEEK IN YEARS AND KNOWS THE TRICK... TO MAKE MY LADY LAUGH WHEN SHE'S DISPOSED... TOLD OUR INTENTS BEFORE, WHICH ONCE DISCLOSED, THE LADIES DID CHANGE FAVORS. AND THEN WE, FOLLOWING THE SIGNS, WOOED BUT THE SIGN OF SHE. [ Man ] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IN HONOR OF HER ROYAL HIGHNESS, COSTARD AND THE PEOPLE OF NAVARRE WILL GIVE A SPECIAL PERFORMANCE IN ONE MINUTE. ONE MINUTE. BEROWNE, THEY WILL SHAME US. LET THEM NOT APPROACH. WE ARE SHAME-PROOF, MY LORD. AND 'TIS SOME POLICY TO HAVE ONE SHOW WORSE THAN THE KING'S AND HIS COMPANY. [ Newsreader ] WELL, IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME THE LADIES HAVE TURNED THE TABLES ON THE BOYS, BUT THEIR CUNNING PLAN TO CHANGE MASKS, CHANGE PARTNERS AND DANCE... MADE THOSE RED-FACED BOYS REALLY FACE THE MUSIC. BUT ALL IS FORGIVEN AS OATHS ARE FORGOTTEN, AND IT'S SHOW TIME. "THE PAGEANT OF THE NINE WORTHIES" IS GIVEN A ROUSING TREATMENT... BY THE PEOPLE OF NAVARRE. IT'S HIGH JINKS ALL ROUND. WHOOPS ! CAREFUL, SIR. HMM, BET THAT HURT. MASKS AND FACES MAKE THIS MERRY CROWD... FORGET THE GRIM EVENTS OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD. HEY, LOOK OUT, JOHNNY. NO MORE STUDY FOR THESE MEN. THEY'RE IN THE LOVE BUSINESS, AND THERE'S NO BUSINESS LIKE IT. BUT PERHAPS SOME MIGHT JUST DISAGREE.

WELCOME, MERCADE. BUT THAT THOU INTERRUPT'ST OUR MERRIMENT. I AM SORRY, MADAM, FOR THE NEWS I BRING IS HEAVY IN MY TONGUE. THE KING, YOUR FATHER. DEAD. FOR MY LIFE. EVEN SO. MY TALE IS TOLD. WORTHIES, AWAY. THE SCENE BEGINS TO CLOUD. HOW FARES YOUR MAJESTY? BOYET, PREPARE. I WILL AWAY TONIGHT. MADAM, NOT SO. I DO BESEECH YOU STAY. PREPARE, I SAY. THANK YOU, GRACIOUS LORDS, FOR ALL YOUR FAIR ENDEAVORS... AND ENTREAT OUT OF A NEW SAD SOUL... THAT YOU VOUCHSAFE IN YOUR RICH WISDOM... TO EXCUSE OR HIDE THE LIBERAL OPPOSITION OF OUR SPIRITS. IF OVERBOLDLY WE HAVE BORNE OURSELVES IN THE CONVERSE OF BREATH, YOUR GENTLENESS WAS GUILTY OF IT. FAREWELL, WORTHY LORD. A HEAVY HEART BEARS NOT A NIMBLE TONGUE. EXCUSE ME SO COMING TOO SHORT OF THANKS... FOR YOUR GREAT SUIT SO EASILY OBTAINED. THE EXTREME PARTS OF TIME EXTREMELY FORMS ALL CAUSES TO THE PURPOSE OF HIS SPEED. AND OFTEN AT HIS VERY LOOSE DECIDES THAT WHICH LONG PROCESS COULD NOT ARBITRATE. AND THOUGH THE MOURNING BROW OF PROGENY FORBID THE SMILING COURTESY OF LOVE, THE HOLY SUIT WHICH FAIN IT WOULD CONVINCE. YET, SINCE LOVE'S ARGUMENT WAS FIRST ON FOOT, LET NOT THE CLOUD OF SORROW JOSTLE IT FOR WHAT IT PURPOSED. I UNDERSTAND YOU NOT. MY GRIEFS ARE DOUBLE. HONEST, PLAIN WORDS BEST PIERCE THE EAR OF GRIEF... AND BY THESE BADGES UNDERSTAND THE KING. FOR YOUR FAIR SAKES, HAVE WE NEGLECTED TIME. PLAYED FOUL PLAY WITH OUR OATHS. YOUR BEAUTY, LADIES, HATH MUCH DEFORMED US FASHIONING OUR HUMORS. EVEN TO THE OPPOSED END OF OUR INTENTS... AND WHAT IN US HATH SEEMED RIDICULOUS. THOSE HEAVENLY EYES THAT LOOK INTO THOSE FAULTS, SUGGESTED US TO MAKE THEM. THEREFORE, LADIES, OUR LOVE BEING YOURS, THE ERROR THAT LOVE MAKES IS LIKEWISE YOURS. WE HAVE RECEIVED YOUR LETTERS FULL OF LOVE. YOUR FAVORS THE AMBASSADORS OF LOVE. AND IN OUR MAIDEN COUNCIL, RATED THEM AT COURTSHIP, PLEASANT JEST AND COURTESY... AS BOMBAST AND AS LINING TO THE TIME. BUT MORE DEVOUT THAN THIS IN OUR RESPECTS, HAVE WE NOT BEEN, AND THEREFORE MET YOUR LOVES IN THEIR OWN FASHION, LIKE A MERRIMENT. OUR LETTERS, MADAM, SHOWED MUCH MORE THAN JEST. SO DID OUR LOOKS. WE DID NOT QUOTE THEM SO. NOW, AT THE LATEST MINUTE OF THE HOUR, GRANT US YOUR LOVES. A TIME, METHINKS, TOO SHORT... TO MAKE A WORLD-WITHOUT-END BARGAIN IN. NO, NO, MY LORD, YOUR GRACE IS PERJURED MUCH. FULL OF DEAR GUILTINESS... AND THEREFORE THIS: IF FOR MY LOVE AS THERE IS NO SUCH CAUSE, YOU WILL DO AUGHT. THIS SHALL YOU DO FOR ME. YOUR OATH, I WILL NOT TRUST. BUT GO WITH SPEED TO SOME FORLORN AND NAKED HERMITAGE. THERE STAY UNTIL THE 12 CELESTIAL SIGNS... HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT THE ANNUAL RECKONING. IF THIS AUSTERE, INSOCIABLE LIFE... CHANGE NOT YOUR OFFER MADE IN HEAT OF BLOOD, THEN AT THE EXPIRATION OF THE YEAR, COME CHALLENGE ME. CHALLENGE ME BY THESE DESSERTS. AND BY THIS VIRGIN PALM NOW KISSING THINE, I WILL BE THINE. AND TILL THAT INSTANCE, SHUT MY WOEFUL SELF UP IN A MOURNING HOUSE, RAINING THE TEARS OF LAMENTATION... FOR THE REMEMBRANCE OF MY FATHER'S DEATH. HENCE HERMIT, THEN... MY HEART... IS IN THY BREAST. WHAT SAYS MARIA? AT THE TWELVEMONTH'S END... I'LL CHANGE MY BLACK GOWN FOR A FAITHFUL FRIEND. I'LL STAY WITH PATIENCE, BUT THE TIME IS LONG. A TWELVEMONTH AND A DAY, I'LL MARK NO WORDS THAT SMOOTH-FACED WOOERS SAY. COME WHEN THE KING DOTH TO MY LADY COME. THEN, IF I HAVE MUCH LOVE, I'LL GIVE YOU SOME. I'LL SERVE THEE TRUE AND FAITHFULLY TILL THEN. YET, SWEAR NOT, LEST YE BE FORSWORN AGAIN. [ Laughs ] MISTRESS, LOOK ON ME. BEHOLD THE WINDOW OF MY HEART, MINE EYE. WHAT HUMBLE SUIT ATTENDS THY ANSWER THERE. IMPOSE SOME SERVICE ON ME FOR THY LOVE. OFT HAVE I HEARD OF YOU, MY LORD BEROWNE, BEFORE I SAW YOU, AND THE WORLD'S LARGE TONGUE... PROCLAIMS YOU FOR A MAN REPLETE WITH MOCKS. FULL OF COMPARISONS AND WOUNDING FLOUTS, WHICH YOU ON ALL ESTATES WILL EXECUTE... THAT LIE WITHIN THE MERCY OF YOUR WIT. TO WEED THIS WORMWOOD FROM YOUR FRUITFUL BRAIN, AND THEREWITHAL TO WIN ME, IF YOU PLEASE. WITHOUT THE WHICH, I AM NOT TO BE WON. YOU SHALL, THIS TWELVEMONTH TERM FROM DAY TO DAY, VISIT THE SPEECHLESS SICK... AND STILL CONVERSE WITH GROANING WRETCHES. AND YOUR TASK SHALL BE, WITH ALL THE FIERCE ENDEAVOR OF YOUR WIT, TO ENFORCE THE PAINED IMPOTENT TO SMILE. TO MOVE WILD LAUGHTER IN THE THROAT OF DEATH? IT CANNOT BE. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE. MIRTH CANNOT MOVE A SOUL IN AGONY. WHY, THAT'S THE WAY TO CHOKE A GIBING SPIRIT, WHOSE INFLUENCE IS BEGOT OF THAT LOOSE GRACE, WHICH SHALLOW LAUGHING HEARERS GIVE TO FOOLS. A JEST'S PROSPERITY LIES IN THE EAR OF HIM THAT HEARS IT, NEVER IN THE TONGUE OF HIM THAT MAKES IT. THEN, IF SICKLY EARS, DEAFED WITH THE CLAMOR OF THEIR OWN DEAR GROANS, WILL HEAR YOUR IDLE SCORNS, CONTINUE THEN, AND I WILL HAVE YOU... AND THAT FAULT WITHAL. BUT, IF THEY WILL NOT THROW AWAY THAT SPIRIT, AND I SHALL FIND YOU EMPTY OF THAT FAULT, RIGHT JOYFUL OF YOUR REFORMATION. A TWELVEMONTH? WELL... BEFALL WHAT WILL BEFALL. I'LL JEST A TWELVEMONTH... IN AN... HOSPITAL. AY, SWEET MY LORD, AND SO I TAKE MY LEAVE. NO, MADAM. WE WILL BRING YOU ON YOUR WAY. OUR WOOING DOTH NOT END LIKE AN OLD PLAY. JACK HATH NOT JILL. COME, SIR.
