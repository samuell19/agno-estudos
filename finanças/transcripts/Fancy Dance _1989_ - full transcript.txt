The road you're on is one so long. Why do you have to go at all ? Why, ask, do you have to go ? Go away and leave me ? The one you love is gone. Never to return What are you looking for ? and why ? Poor little Masoho. Yohei, you're unfair ! Make it one or the other. This is all there is. "Fancy Dance" To inherit the temple, he must become a novitiate. One tough year, then he cleans up. A great life. I'm stuck in a third rate food co. Ah, the 2nd generation. The 10th, actually. Proper little Yohei must make daddy happy. It's wonderful. Grandfather's so thrilled. It's only a year. You needn't start right after taking vows. You're free until Father passes on. Be still, or I'm not responsible. Sorry. It's only a year. Then I'll come back. You won't keep your vows. Make me break'em. You'll never change. Don't wanna be no priest Baby, at the very least Don't wanna be no reverend Baby, that'd be the end Don't wanna go to a monastery I'd rather stay in Tokyo Drop dead Her ex was a Christian. From Jesus to the Buddha. Come back alive How noble to take the robe. And so young. You want one? thank you. Ikuo Brother What are you doing?. I'm going, too. Two brothers taking the robe, how touching. Would you like one? You still angry? Don't let him know you're going, too. He's finally given in. So why am here? Because you couldn't take the training. I'm sacrificing everything. And now you pop up. should leave you to inherit. I've no intention of becoming heir. I'll marry into a sect and you'll get dad's temple. You want to be a monk? It's an easy life. But... Is it harsh? can't just leave you. Dad's trapped me. Which way is Tokyo ? The wind cones straight from Tokyo. Masoho, we'll both just have to be chaste. The pleasure will be greater. It's only a year, let's use it wisely. Right, I'm off. It's all my fault. It's for our future. Don't, it'll make it worse. Hi. We beseech you accept us as novices. Can't hear. We beseech you accept us as novices. Speak up. You're late. Avert your eyes. Don't dare meet my eye You hear? Eyes down Name? What is your name? Chinrai Shinada. Speak up. I am Chinrai Shinada. Speak up I am Chinrai Shinada... Why are you here?. Don't you know?. Then you're refused admission. Get out! Anyone else want out?. Why are you here?. As a novice. Novices?. To train my mind and body. What's this I, me, mine? What's this? A Walkman. know that You're not on vacation Sutras, not rock Shut up! Get up! My leg's asleep. Get out! You idiot! A Shinto charm! Why bring that? From Mum. It's not a pub. What? It's not mine. It's that fat guy's. Get a move on. Come on, son. Who do they think they are? We had to prove worthy of admittance. Initial indoctrination began. To bed by nine and up at three. The first week spent sitting zazen. Our only release meals, cleaning and daily ablutions. Love you What the hell Stupid clod! Don't sup like a dog. Straighten up, hold your bowl and eat silently. Yohei, don't do that. Your tongue. Stop that. Eishun, no noise. Etiquette took away what little taste rice, sesame, soup and one vegetable had. Our bellies constantly empty. Become the rag. Clean everything not just dirt. Don't dawdle C'mon, hurry! Move, move. My girl inherits the temple. I've got to take vows to marry her. But it's a real goldmine. Even got tennis courts. Marrying into money? What about you? I'm escaping from a woman. When my hair is as long as yours, we'll wed Stop singing Rags do not sing. Get a move on What's the noise? Abbot... Are you alright? Are you okay? You're hopeless. She's beautiful. After a week we were off probation and permitted to enter the temple. Move very cramped quarters. Our names took Chinese readings. Yohei remained the same, Ikuo became Ikusho. It's Shoei and her attendant. What? She's sort of like a prefect here. What's a perfect? Don't you read comics? You're so out of touch. We both will while we're here. Monks are very trendy. They're so cool. We novices were each assigned labor. Which rotated regularly amongst the novices. With no chance of refusal. Monk's Monthly I got the bell. Where each toll differs, as they mark observance in precise instants, the passing of time. But there are many. To waken, ablutions, to mark the hours... The daily rituals, prayers and observances Meal times, cleaning, various duties, and so on. In total, 17 distinct routines. The mores and sounds were all codified all of seven hundred years ago. had to memoriza it all. Not only morning but all day long. No one's actually counting. Latrine duty. Toilet Some have it great here. A big temple? Probably not. Forget it, she's a dog. You're lucky, you've got Madonna. It may be my last chance. Fair enough. He hasn't got it, has he? Cleaning, chanting, zazen and gruel. Toil and blows broken by the respite of sleep. But even that is Spartan. With proscribed conduct for sleeping. Two quilts lashed together Like a sleeping bag. The head turned towards the Buddha. No crossing nor relaxation of the legs. No nudity, nor indecent posturing. The body to the right, legs slightly bent. Right hand beneath the chin. Left leg atop the right. That's sleep. Sweep it Work, boy There's Madonna. Who? The temple heartthrob. You're kidding She brings her Grandmoyher. Wash it. He's been here too long. She's very sweet. I'm not that desperate. She's a convenience store. Always open. You're ever so kind. Atsushi? Bring it closer. Say when. Don't defile the bowl. No noises. Both hands. It's supposed to purify and motivate us. There's a new product proposal to submit. Better my resignation. Then you could come here. t's great. You must be kidding. But you have changed. Really? This ancient code of Zen is starting to dawn on me. thought it was so unfashionable for a cityboy. But even the art of going to the toilet, the style and grace of action that transcends chic. Not only that. The whole ritualistic bit. It's really moved me. thought it was the pits but the sense, style and the grace fascinate me. Outside there's no such aesthetic sence. Look at the lines of the robes. Zen's founder intuitively defined ultimate cool. And Buddha even cooler Now feel my bring, right down to my fingertips. It's living the ultimate fashion. Call me paranoid, even narcissistic. I am all. A superior being the Buddha was right. You haven't changed. Yeah, well... You misunderstand... No, understand. No, you see,... What are you up to? What are you doing here, Ikusho? You should be in bed. Why are you here? You do penence tomorrow, you clods You're walking a shaky bridge. Your Walkman. What's your game? Don't be so crass. That's hardly following the Buddha's path. You should be thankful. For you, whoring yourself? Gimme my rock! That is sufficient. pray you understand your penance. entrust them to you. Go get some ice. Yohei, continue. Masoho's seeing Ryuichi again. That Christian with the rock band. Apparently he's taking her to London. London or a mountain temple there's no comparison. What's up, Yohei? We're supposed to go to India together. What do you want? You are realizing your karma in this world of illusion. You are the universe, as it is you. All life forms are the result of karma. What you see and what is is merely illusion. He made the universe in seven days Hosanna! Zen! Hallelujah! Stop my head is spitting What's this all about? You're possessed. was only kidding. Good morning, sir. Morning. Thank you. You wear that to work? No way. She has to be meek. You've grown up. Hi, Atsushi. What's happening? Don't come here dressed like that. Today's Masoho's birthday party. Your birthday, is it? Three days ago. No present, card or call from Yohei. We're cheering her up. He can't communicate for three months. He could've given you a message. You saw him, right? It's a different world. He's totally forgotten all about you. It's different there. I've the perfect present for you. A portable, popup altar. Eishun & Yohei General Affairs Ikusho Reception Chinrai Attendance Your brother certainly knows how to get on. You know, never suspected that. He learns from your mistakes. He won't blow it like you. You want some cake? Shoei uses this for underwear how flash. Master wears a loin cloth. Abbot wears brand name print briefs. A real snob. Bragging he's a city boy. He's very talian casual. Shoei abhors him. Yeah, she's so trad. She's going away for a four day pilgrimage. The Abbot's bound to live it up. He does love his sushi. We can, too. He won't while she's here. heard. What? You've work to do I still heard you. One said the flag is in motion, another said it was the wind. Aha Your souls are the ones that stir Neither the flag nor the wind has motion. As your very soul has none. Do you understand? Were you a fluttering flag you'd know. You called? Do not cast scorn on the fart it is but one manifestation of the Buddha. Ten score sermons crystallized in a fart. When words serve only to confuse. As now and as it was in days of yore. What's he on about? Shoei is going away. You'll miss her. No way. We can raid her room for goodies. For me? Not while Jian's there. Then what? I'll get him out of the way. You want me to steal? Stealing munchies ain't my style. I'm getting old. Don't overdo it. Fantastic brother B227 You got his share? I forgot... He doesn't like sweets. A royal guy. Is it true Jian doesn't want Shoei to know he surrenders to sushi? And we can, too. Don't you dare let on. Delicious, eh? feel empty. Fulfilled Desires make for empty souls. Have you considered what we've done? Look at our regimen. Eat, meditate, clean. Chanting without understanding. What's it all for? To marry your rich girl. A great life to be born into. But it beats me. Monks should be noble. Everyone respects them. don't expect enlightenment but expect a glimmer of understanding. It's another conjob. Money under false pretences. Is your Dad enlightened? He's eaten himself to sleep? Don't you think Chinrai is a weird name? May help you? We were at Reception earlier on. You never mentioned it. don't do school tours. He never said anything. We came to thank kusho. This is his brother. Never How sweet the sound. Wait inside, 'll go get him. Yes Are they cute or what? Just a touch. I've lost my sense. Ready for Madonna, hey? No photographs please. And their bibs are so cute. Totally coordinated, too. Supercool Where'd you get that? Designer, no less Like it? He's coming, you want some photos? Never Ready? At the count of three mock the monk. A funny friar. Give me your address and 'll send them on. That's our camera Of course. What's going on? Hello, kusho. We made an kusho fan club. And we've brought you a present. A bag we made. What's your favorite food? Birthday? Girlfriends? Blood group? The lasses love him. Why the graveyard? It looks like I'm a polite escort. And those schoolgirl photographs? just looked cute. You saw? What's this make you? What's this? Looking for her ancestral plot. Who are you, young lady? Fraternizing with novices is strictly prohibited. Fraternizing? Wait in my study. Send the young lady away. I blew it. Happy Birthday. It's not till October. It's a hard life. You take care. I blew it. I'm sorry. Yohei. Really blown it. You've disgraced yourself. Selling souvenirs. You exploited those pilgrims. Why are you here? Shall answer? You have to to inherit. You're not committed. You think a year here will suffice. But you've no strength of character. Friends appear and you forget your studies. You're both greedy and stupid. I detest you Born into the priesthood. Merely going through the motions. How abominable I care not why you're here. The soul is yours alone. But you will not sully our 700 year history. one more infraction and you're out. Cavorting with schoolgirls I'm the one suffering. He's got it easy. it's stupid Me, too. I'll do what I want. Why should suffer? You've lost your spirit. Really? Caught by the girl you're escaping from and the abbot. Forget it. Forget Masoho? At least write. It's in character. Good morning. Morning. Sorry, 'm busy. Ishida, where's that file? It's not ready... Then get to it. So sorry. I'm not that naive, Yohei. New novices arrived and we advanced. And finally given leave. To beg for alms. Excuse... He's at the temple. Free for tea? You're kidding Want to kill some time? Never He tried to pick me up. He's a monk? Cabaret Club What if we get caught? We won't get caught. Don't be a coward. It's a feelie bar. No, it's a bar. I'm starving Eat & Drink All You Can. Chinrai. Three customers. Welcome. Such cute little monks. What about that guy? He's a slime. He never stopped pawing us. What's going on? May we join you? Start with beer? Beer, please Which temple? I'll do my chowchant. Do it again Eaten himself to sleep again Help me. Oh no How did they know? I'll leave it to you. The rod for you. 20 strokes and one month latrine duty. Meditate till morning. I'll tell on you. About your feasts. You ate, too. So what? You did? How could you? So you could have cakes Stop it Stop it, stupid So you stole those cakes? 50 strokes and a week fasting I'll tell about your smoking and drinking. Little creep! I became the Master's attendant. Almost like a valet. Quarantined from the others. A bad influence. Fishing in a pond with no fish. What am I doing here? Without aim nor arrow no hit nor miss. Totally incommunicado. Ready? No objections from your parents? Objections to what? Zen is the world, it is the universe. All theology is part of the universe. Hi there. Care for some flesh? There are three rules. I didn't watch it being killed. Not killed for me. And no suspicion of same. Therefore, it's pure. That's Koki's? Right, it was on his desk. The whole place has gone to pot. A finger lickin' love story. Madonna came to see him yesterday. With a ribbon on the chicken. But he hid from her. And she waited for five hours. Her love moved him to accept the chicken. You'll still eat it? He can only beat us. I'm used to it. Inhuman! I am the Budhha. That's why I'm here. You there, Yohei? It's Koki Quick, run Yes? So there you are. There's a TV crew, will you help? What about that foreigner? He's had enough of being on show. What about you? You're far more capable than me. I've got things to do. Alright. Let's roll. Here we go. Whenever you're ready. Yes. Sure. Trapped again. Is it bowel or bladder? It's bowel. Is there a ritual at the toilet? Yes. First disrobe. And then... Pour sufficient water. Approach the toilet. Look what's on TV If none responds to the alert, then enter. Purify the right hand. Be at peace with yourself. And then? Wet the left hand and wipe. Wipe what? Sorry? Wipe what? The anus. Isn't that Masoho's boyfriend? The anus. Yes, he is my boyfriend Then wash the left hand. Take your time. And their training continues. The hardest part is in December. A full week of sitting and meditating. From 3 am to 9 pm, and one allnighter. It gives them unparalleled solemnity. Big deal. Chinrai's got suger diabetes? Unbelievable in these spartan conditions. You knew? He's gone back home. Apparently so. Seems like only yesterday. What's that mean? Will you leave in March? Yes, Father has givendispensation. What about you? I've noting to go back to. So I'll finish the course. and become Shoei's disciple. You a disciple? With all those Xmas presents? Who's this for? Eishun? Maybe, let's see. You can't read someone's mail. How else will we know whose it is? You shouldn't. Whose was it? From Masoho? Does everyone know? No. That's good. She ran away with a guy. I'm so hurt. Gotta keep your eyes on'em Eishun stayed. There's no gain without pain became his favorite utterance. No, like this. 652 meditations, 107 latrine duties, 5000 strokes and three days to go. Only three days and 'm free The dispensation threw it away. Whose is it? It's mine. Why? My year is up. You're slated to lead the ascetic training. Show your leadership qualities. But that's not for two months. No one cares. You're wrong. Just yesterday we discussed it. Oh no Oh yes It's your chance. Is it true that I'm to lead the ascetic training? That is correct. I can't. I fully agree. I'll do it You're not leaving? I've one thing to say. If you're not here when I need you you're no lover. In name only means nothing. I regret your loss. Hello? Been promoted, have you? You keep it up, boy We'll come to give you support. Banzai! Meat today. Eat up Yohei and Ikuo. Temple life is broken into summer and winter. Punctuated by three months of ascetic training. The leaders serve as examples. All culminating in Zen questioning. If unsuccessful no diploma is given. In smaller temples five questions suffice. Here, with 25 members we fave 25 questions. I expected Dad to question me. We won't lose, boys The attendant sets the schedule. Koki grinds the organ, I play monkey. 119 days to go. Alright, we're in charge of this we can't expect things to go as we please. The novices will be bound to test you to see if you're worthy of the position. In effect they'll be your enemies. He'll rely on your support, Eishun. This is filthy. Koki decided the theme for Zen questioning. That's a hard task. What's unclear? I don't understand. If you did, the Buddha would have no statue. No matter what your reasons for coming here, you now have a position of responsibility In Zen terms, you're stop the bamboo pole. The highest for one of your rank. What do you do now? Any fool can climb. If one keeps climbing, he'll fall. The Keeper asked: Whence are the masters of old? He feigned not to hear. The Keeper was dissatisfied. Next day the Keeper offered tea. Whereupon he stroked the Keeper's back. At that moment, the Keeper knew he was enlightened. From patting his back? Sounds gay to me. Your pardon. dropped my bowl at mealtime. Thrash him! Punishment deserves gravity. I cannot do it. I'm not capable. That is not in question. Put yourself in his place. Such caresses will not expiate his sin. Your mercy is not becoming to either. You also must feel the blow. I'll clean the toilets. The disciple loved to lay in with the rod. But he stroked the Keeper's back. At times cotton should be swathed in iron. At others, a stone swathed in cotton. I finish off the questioning. Be sure to follow the correct sequence. Or else you'll throw him off track. To all it must appear to be real. You must move the audience. Right, from Ikusho. We begin... How many times must tell you? Shout it, boy What's with the getup? The Day of Questioning Yohei. I knew you'd come. You certainly look the part. Anyone would after 14 months and 18 days. If you can joke, you must have. No, I don't think I have. I only have three months to go. That makes me cheerful. But you like it here? I deny it, in the name of god. Another joke. You're being nice again. As you would to an ant. You can't have me and the temple. Do your best. Where are the others? They couldn't take it. I can't sit with these on. They hurt. The Keeper asked, whence are the masters of old? He feigned not to hear. I give thee this rod. To kill or enlighten? The Zen Questioning begins. If you have answers, speak them And the enlightened one who lost his way? He of whom you speak, I know not. Should such a person suddenly appear. There is no difference between illusion and enlightenment. It is well understood. You must learn to see reality amidst the illusion. Your blessing. You've done well. Why choose a koan so difficult? To show the import of my life study. Give meaning to your words. All that exists does to an end come. Life is but the bat of an eye. What meanest thou? The very flowers clutching the cliff have life. There is more to impart. Wouldst thou desire to hear? And your advice for those still searching? Be it false and I shall smite you. Hasten not upon this road for all must journey towards enlightenment. You have gone far in your studies. But beware the fall from the pinnacle of vanity. Be praised. Your tutelage. Be it praised. Stop! Wait. Heed me. You have succumbed to the flesh. What have you to say? Let it be. Enough You have lost to the desire of flesh. You have far to go. have only taken the first step. And fallen to the bottom again. The abbot and Shoei recommend should leave. But the Master insists I've just begun. And wants me to continue. Between Masoho and Zen swim in a sea of desire. Thank you. What happened? Once he felt my tongue, he lost it.
