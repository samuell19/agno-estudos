Tomorrow we've got to be faster. Tomorrow we've got to be faster. We're losing the light. You're the slow one. Mary, slow down! We all have our own story. What's magic hour? They say evening light is the nicest. Who told you that story? Who do the sun and the moon belong to? - No good. - Just take it. - The light's gone. - So what? But magic hour is prettier. I'm pretty enough. You're such a pain. - It's got to be right. - There's no difference. Look... See? - Bullshit! - Please? Don't kick me. I want a jellyﬁsh. Suri... I want a jellyfish. Order it online. Shit. Is it alive? lt's hibernating. Just defrost it. Am I being silly? Shit! Forgot the lunch box for two months. Now it's mouldy. Mould makes me sad. He made you a lunch box every day. That's hard to find. Sometimes, we're not always right. Try a new perspective. But I don't like him. No rush, beautiful. Waiting for perfection which doesn't exist. Are you a lesbian? Ha-ha, very funny. I'm always impatient, except when it comes to love. If it's not right, why rush? If you miss me, tell me. Anyway, he's gone now. Yeah, he left last year. - 11th grade? - Yeah. - | feel bad about that. - You should. Why "busy body"? Why "busy body"? Who cares? - It's weird. - You're weird! Homes and Gardens. Why did you do that? I want to have a garden. I want to have a park. Whatever. You're in our way, mister. Shit, first day of school again. Final term of high school, suck it up. Planning my future. - What's this? - "University Life Is Beautiful"? GRADUATION IS HONOURABLE Skipping graduation. I'm not one for ceremony. Asked the university to send my diploma. Mum said "up to you". Too beautiful for me. Told Mum I don't enjoy electives. It's actually a requirement, not even an elective. A DIPLOMA LEADS TO BETTER WAGES I graduated anyway. Don't need a piece of paper to tell me that. Luckily, Mum and Dad agree. This is what our future holds? It's just a ceremony. If you think about it, there's no real meaning at all. Cool, 70% off. I don't need to buy everything I like. Not like my younger self. Let's go. I'm poor. So lucky. I found a million baht. So lucky. I'm rich, let's take a trip. Italy or Florence, where to start? Italy or Florence? They're the same place. Don't be like a rich bimbo. Do what you believe. Actually, I want to go to America. I believe in Obama. So go to America. So far away. I can't fly more than five hours. - l getjetlag. - You're so annoying. I want to take pretty pictures of ugly things and call the album "Skin Deep". Is it too sad? Should I delete it? Delete it. But it's pretty. Going against the crowd. Hi, Kun. Where have you been? Haven't seen you around. Got into university already. Why come to school? - Where are you going? - Just walking around. - Tough life, huh? - See you later. - Have you seen Gift? - No. - See ya. - Bye. - Gift's gone too? - Yeah. Lucky girls, skipping class. I want my acceptance letter too. Just stay here with me. You'll miss me, huh? Mementos will one day become junk. Hey, let's make a yearbook. To remember everyone. Yearbooks have shitty pictures. I'll take the photos myself. Dad and Mum said "use Bluetooth". Use Bluetooth! Can't you just say "cheese"? I want a smile. Getting carried away. - One more? - No, that's enough. - Hi, Teacher. - Hello. Final term? So what does the future hold? It's dangerous not to know yourself. Next week we're starting the yearbook. Next week? That's the near future. 120 grams paper, 4 colour printing. Asking parents for money is the last resort. So I'd like to ask the school for money. If you can't do it, don't say it. - Can you do it? - Yes. ls 200,000 enough? Enough is enough. Stop talking. Can we have 300,000? I like strong, simple work. I want to do a minimalist style, like a photo book. Sparse text with beautiful photos. You're only worthy if you're proud of your work. To be worthy of the school... Get serious and do it. Here's 400,000. Good luck. Thank you, Teacher. Money! Practice leads to improvement. Jungle retreat? Is this overkill? - My work is conceptual. - Overkill. Red Bull. So busy looking for others, I got lost. Where am |? Mushrooms! Borrowed four books from the library: patterns, textures, ﬁgures, illustrations. And a how-to manual. Very minimal. Out of glue. 104.5 Love Radio is pretty good. Careless/y destroying paper. Want to plant a paper tree. Mum... On the roof, snow falls like ﬂowers. Mum, there's snow on the roof. And fog too. When you arrive, the fog disappears. Girl high on mushrooms. Bring the helicopter. Want some gum? - Hi, Teacher. - So was the jungle retreat useful? My portfolio is very minimal. This isn't minimal. This isn't minimal. It isn't minimal. The truth is maybe I've got nothing. Four pancakes, please. Welcome Love? What? Why are your hands cold? - Turning red! - Shut up. He's probably just passing by. Please just pass by. You OK? How many fingers? Four? I only count three. Three? Today in France. Where are you? I wasn't done. - Paris. - Huh? Saturday, I'll be rich! | forgot my coat, so I'll be back on Friday. Mum will send money on Saturday. But that's too late. Are you crazy? I'm impulsive (when I'm alone). I don't know. Just felt like going to Paris. I'm not that crazy, even on my period. I'm reasonable. But I follow my heart. What are you doing there? - Sleeping. - Huh? I've got majorjetlag. I'm learning about my likes and dislikes. I don't like being alone like this. If one day you all disappeared, how would I go on with life? Yeah, I worry about that too. Keep page 11. | read in a magazine: "every day counts". - What magazine? - A French one. - You read French? - | read a dictionary. Hey, start chatting, this is costing me 100 baht a minute. I really counted three fingers... Condos, concrete, control. Bangkok again. Why did I go to Paris? MARY'S WELCOME HOME PARTY! I hate social functions. I never know anyone. - Why are you hiding? - Shit, you scared me. Everyone keeps asking why I went to Paris. But I don't know. Just come out! Unconscious. Recently, my life's been so weird. I do things without any reason. Do you need a reason? Like you wake up hungry for noodles. There's no reason. Right? Noodles don't need a reason. It's like being controlled. Whatever. Suddenly, a grasshopper on my arm. See. Weird right? I want to eat some cake. No cake on Fridays. CLOSED Cake! I want to eat birthday cake, even though it's not my birthday. - I want to eat birthday cake! - Wait until next year! Bitch! That's tear gas! Folding paper triangles. Why are you folding them? Oh yeah... Why? Bought a whole lot of chinaware. Want to paint them! What did you buy this for? Suri is confused by the printer. Hey, it's your name. Shit... Why me? This is freaky. Who's Nawapol? - Hi, Teacher. - Hi. I want you to... Thank you. You sound like you're leaving us. I'm going to learn to be a stuntman. Or maybe a comedian. So busy teaching, forgot to learn. I'm leaving the yearbook in your hands. Why did Teacher leave? Without any warning at all. It's not so strange. We've got to kick ass on the yearbook. Teacher left it to us. This is our time. Shit... You talk like a movie. Busy day today. Two people a day? Isn't it too much? You wanted only magic hour. How about half a person a day? Is it too rushed? Should be enough. Left. - More left. - Hurry up. I can't take it. The light's gone. There 's always tomorrow. Let's chat. What's your dream? I want to open a sausage factory. - You? - Personal motto? Here's Gift's house. Gift ran away from home. When will she be back? I don't know. She comes and goes. Will she return tomorrow? Where did she go? Even her mum doesn't know. How would I know? Let's call Jane. She's a psychic. I saw her on TV. Hello, Jane? She's in the Netherlands. Copy the file to the computer. Do it yourself. Power is in my hands. - I'm the editor. - You're the boss! Delete the file when you're done. Why erase? l'll laugh if there's a blackout. The mouth does more damage than the hand. - Blackout! - Fuck. Always press 'save'. The files are gone. We have to do the interviews again? - Yes, editor. - Fuck... Two minutes of uplifting music. Suri, who's Pakorn? Is this for me? I'm soon to be important to someone. Your name's on the postcard. Who is this? Uncle brought birds, but I prefer ducks or chickens. Mary. Yo, pause. - Hi, Uncle. - These are for you. Hey, I got three birds! Cute birds. Looks good. - How does it taste? - Chicken's better. Hope you starve. You'd rather starve? Stand your ground. Does my phone give an electric shock? It's an iFeng 7. Made in China. I told her not to buy it. Did I faint? No. But you'll need to do some physical therapy. Mum said no massages during my period. I googled it and got: "the bed gets dirty". lfl didn't have my period, I'd get a massage. Funny. Can't ﬁnd a swimsuit. Maybe I'll sew one. These styles suck. I don't want to do swim therapy. Hey, you're the one who didn't want to swim. I'm bitten by the lazy bug. Can I have a hug? | read in a health manual that hugging is a form of exercise. No inner lining. My wallet's got no inner lining. - You spent that million already? - Yeah. - Was that a play on words? - You're so slow. - Hey... - What? You applied to the University of Austria? Yeah, but they haven't replied yet. You want to repeat 12th grade so we can stay together? - Are you crazy? - I'm serious. Can't stay, got to go. Even if we're apart, you can just call me. It's not the same. Is my heart big enough for the world? One, two, three... Born looking old. - Kun, when did you start looking old? - Bitch. Hard. Hard. Homework is hard. This one's hard. Why did you sign up for cloud speed class? So I can take nice yearbook photos. Circle. Looks more like a triangle. Always (appear) conﬁdent. That cloud will pass by the sun in 245 seconds. Mum, are you back? Can you cook dinner? No rice today. Mum's been at the temple for a week. I miss her. Suri, can you come over? My mum's gone. I'm lonely. And my Ah Ma's dead too. Miss Ah Gong and Ah Ma. Want to eat ice cream together. Ice cream? Going to exercise and then do my homework. Want some? Don't need to eat, I won't die. I prefer Mum's cooking. Always changing my mind. Your mum's not around forever, you know. Hey, this is Ma-Ma noodles. Ha-fucking-ha. Five pancakes. Sometimes, the answer comes before the question. My name is M. I'm single. Don't need caffeine tonight. I can't sleep. I didn't drink coffee. I can't sleep because he's single. Busy with all my heart. Shit, my heart is thumping. What are the ethics of school pregnancy? Mary? Only my body is awake. Stillness is better than chatter. Mary can sleep with her eyes open. She didn't sleep last night. Clean and dirty can coexist. How can you sleep without washing your hair? - You do it too. - No, I don't. - Yeah, right. - I don't! What to do about tomorrow? What should I do tomorrow? Don't wait until tomorrow, wash your hair today. l was talking about M. Tomorrow what will I do about today? Just take it day by day. See what happens. I can't do that. I've got to go all in. Tomorrow only happens once. When I try to sleep, I can't. What should I do? I'll have bags under my eyes. lt's tomorrow already. Two pancakes. Always lose the race with time. - How... - I got to go. Etc. Shit, you're late. Tim's mum is waiting downstairs! Sorry, let's shoot. The light's gone. Just fucking shoot it! Shoot it! Shoot it. Got it? I got to go. Sorry. Good job. I'm living in multiple realms. M. is like a spirit. Comes and goes without warning. I saw him the other day. But as soon as | sat down, he left. Just like that. What's next? Nothing ofﬁcial. Nothing official. Who's the one for me? Just chill out. Maybe he's a drug dealer. You got to be careful. Shit... Who knows? Know what? You know his name and he's single. He looks nice though. Scissors. Just looking at scissors makes me think of being apart. - Why did you stab me? - You're annoying! Confusion is like putting sunblock on at night. Oh. Concrete above, not sky. I want to be sad with a sky backdrop. My heart has brought me this far. What the fuck are you doing? This is no time for Wong Kar-wai. And you don't even smoke! Give it here. Great things can be achieved alone. Hey... If we're going to look for Gift in the jungle, we've got to go alone. We're already over budget. We've still got go. The yearbook's got to have everyone. Damn. So busy buzzy. Hi Jane, we're lost. Please show us the way. Find her tonight? OK. What's Gift doing out here? Thank you, Jane. I think we've found her. You're difﬁcult. Gift. Why did she leave her clothes? Weird. Yeah, weird. Weird, weird, and more weird. GOODBYE WORLD Hey... Come look at this. Back and forth, that's all. I don't think Gift's coming back. - Maybe she found nirvana. - Don't be silly. Thinking of you. Haven't seen M. recently. Really? Yo, be careful. - Hey. - What? 11:11 is the best time to pray. - Who said? - Someone said. Someone who? Shit, now it's 11:12. Uncertainty abounds. Do you think there's an algorithm to predict the future? That would be too predictable. So I should make the first move? You want to wait for him to make the move? I'd look like a slut. Are you? Everything takes time. PANCAKE ROLLS Want to spend time with you. Fail (not fall) in love. He didn't come. I'm a failed slut. I suck. Calm down, drama queen. You might need ten slutty days to succeed. What do I do for the next nine days? I don't know. I'm not a slut. Thanks. The shakes. What's wrong? The shakes again? I don't want you to go and study abroad. I don't want to miss you. Missing you. That's howl feel. "Time waits for no man" - Monk Why did the headmaster die? Because he was old. - Hi, Teacher. - Hello. Mary, I've got something to ask you. Yes? The headmaster's last words were... "Mary soon..." Was he talking about you? I don't know. Intentions are always a mystery. Why would the headmaster say that? His last words. What a conundrum. - Were you his mistress? - Fuck off. Be responsible for your words. Wasting time again. CALCULATING FUTURE PROBABILITY That book is nonsense. Why are you reading it? I want to know what the headmaster meant. Was he trying to warn me about something? Maybe it's just a coincidence. Maybe there is some force controlling my life. Please spread the word. All students must attend class. All students must move into the dorms. These are the rules of our new headmaster. No exceptions. Questions and opinions... ...are forbidden. That's all. Keep quiet. Fault lines lead to separation. Separation is a natural phenomenon. Want to sit on the roof and read a book surrounded by ﬂowers and a sewing machine. We're forbidden to leave school for the entire term. Good. We can be together. Writing my diary in the evening with nice music. Then going to the market in the morning. How will I see M.? Chill out... Don't be so slutty. We need to find an escape route. Look... They're changing the school motto. "Follow orders." Today is our headmaster's first day. 12 December. Huge room! The new headmaster seems OK. - How do you know? - His eyes. It's in the eyes. It didn't work. What to do? - Did you pay attention? - Yes. Still dancing. What are you doing? Staring at his eyes gives me the shakes. My life is getting weirder every day. This is serious. You must really like him. Is this what it feels like to be in love? I want to go left. Is that really my choice? Or am I being controlled by some force? And if! go right? Am I overcoming the force? Or is the force controlling me all the same? I don't really care. I'll follow you. Just love. And love? Is it me or the force? Are you going to write a fucking poem? So is it right or left? Even the water pump sounds weird. Listen... The sound is in the wrong key. Isn't it weird? You're weird, not the pump. Within estimation. What are you doing? Writing down all the weird things. The water pump? | read it in "Calculating Future Probability". Like when you're sick, you write down your symptoms. This way, I can predict the future. You go, girl. M. kissed you already? No, these are song lyrics. - Then why are you blushing? - I'm not. No diary in a while. Why don't you write in a diary? No need. I can use the receipts in my purse. The feeling returns. I'm missing M. again. Kick the sewing machine. I want to kick it! Cleaning day: the room, the fan, the car. We've got to wash the headmaster's car now? It's the new curriculum. Maybe it will come in useful. If you loved someone, could you control yourself? Probably not. No commitments. I'm scared. I'm taking it slow. Love's a good thing. Chill out. It's a good thing. What's that formula? I'm trying to predict the next five minutes. lmightjust bump into M. Hi, Teacher. We're moving to a new classroom. This room will be used to store Headmaster Soup and Coffee. His factory has run out of space. Oversized piggy bank. Is that a joke? Say it, do it. Crazy year 2012. Is this my shit year? Your final exam will be about our headmaster. Study his biography. Know you quick, love you quick. Eating canned coffee and soup. But actually, I prefer cake. Headmaster Soup. Extra strength. Headmaster Coffee, regular strength. No other choice for lunch? My stash of cake is almost gone. My brain Is ﬁlled with rubbish. The headmaster's biog... How will that be of any future use? It's the new curriculum. They've probably thought it out. The headmaster likes mangosteen too. I like moustaches. The headmaster looks good with a moustache. Shut up! We've got to get 10 out of 10 to pass. The headmaster collects scissors, hoops, needles, cloth, coloured pencils and the like. Scissors, hoops... That's weird. But I'm censoring some yearbook questions. Bad questions. "Does school bore you?" is censored? I like early risers. So I should rise early to meet them. Come and see M. with me. I want to see him. Hey. Want to steal some cake. We want cake. Give us some. If you don't, we'll be forced to cut you. What flavour? My cake! What happens if M. isn't there? I don't know. Get a peacock. Mum likes them. Let's get a peacock. Mum likes them. Wait, what about M.? I don't know. I want to see M. But let's find a peacock first. Drunk on air. We don't have to like the same things. Why did that happen? I like today. I'm so happy right now. I don't want anything to change. I want to look for peacocks every day with you. You're all-purpose. All-purpose? I'm not a van, OK? All I need is you. The end. Was I dreaming? Did I dream you got into the University of Austria? I really did. Here's the letter. Are we destined to be together? Calm down. I'm moving to a new country, not a new planet. The Flintstones. In the Stone Age, travelling was a big deal. You could never call home. That's why Stone Age people loved forever. Life was hard. Winter mosquitoes are big. What's wrong? Holy shit, is that a mosquito or a lion? My body is awake. All this peacock nonsense, what about the yearbook? I'll try harder. Try harder and it will be OK. It's straightforward. From now on, you will follow my orders. But that's not fair. I'm the editor. Right. Fuck the yearbook. Let's just remember each other. No need to record it, just remember it. Nothing's going as planned. It will look like shit. And it's my name that will be credited as the editor. Doing it. Hey... Suddenly, I'm thinking about sex. Another weird thing. - Where are you going? - To see M. You're still thinking about sex? You're just a kid! What about the yearbook? In reality, I dream that we're together. Can we meet each other more often? I don't know. If it happens, it happens. But you're here now. But we're together now. Take down the laundry before it catches cold. I got to go. It's going to rain. Really? The person I never dream about. Why don't I dream about you? So what? I usually dream about boys I like. - You mean you like me? - That's not what I meant. It's nice when we argue and you say, "Please listen. " And when I ask you to come back, like in the movies. Please don't go. Time's up. See you next time. When? Now it's clear. It's not meant to be. Don't say that. Are you OK? I'm fine. I'm ﬁne means I'm not ﬁne. If you think of sex and then think of him... ...then it's probably meant to be. Forgot about that. Oh yeah. Forgot about that. Who knows when our paths will diverge? Right or left? I don't know. Like is a feeling, love an emotion. What's the difference? Nice sayings are always hard to understand. Why can't things be easy? Right then. I'll go left then. See you later. If it doesn't work out, so be it. There's no way to be certain. Just do it. Let me get my Nike's first. Keep it inside. lfyou like him, just tell him. Then you'll know. The boy should make the first move. You want to be in control, don't you? You want to take a walk with me? Are soulmates meant to be together? Why this track? I don't know. What did you bring? Mum doesn't like bags. - My mum's bag. - Another recycled New Year's gift? - It's a nice bag. - It's still recycled. Swapping gifts. Shit, I get your mum's bag. Not accepting New Year's invites. I can't think that far ahead. I'm free this New Year. Just saying. No big deal. New Year, hurry up, please. New Year again. Sucks. Anyway, durian is expensive this season. - What are you going to do? - About what? About New Year. We're still talking about New Year? Different rhythm, the same understanding. To admire is better than to be admired. Or is it just me? It's a ﬁne line between attraction and affection. People + people = people Have you thought about the class photo? I'm still waiting for the perfect light. The perfect light? When will that happen? So true it hurts. Our bodies age, but our hearts remain the same. You think it's possible that one day we'll no longer be friends? Maybe. You're supposed to say "no". You are my dream. Exterior - Train Tracks - Magic Hour She said, "I love you." He replied, "I love you, too." The end. Isn't this too happy? It's too easy. Easy? This homework is damn hard. Let's get to the point, we're going round in circles. What do you want to say to the audience? I'm not sure. Love stories are hard to write. I'm still unsure. You've written a standard drama. Beginning, middle, end. Nothing's new. Everything's been done. But it's all too easy. There's no conflict. Love has conﬂicts. Always. Should I make the characters more confused? Is that conflict? Yes, that's one way. But I don't want conflict. Then what's the audience going to watch? Right? Camera charged, songs downloaded, ready to go. But where 's my diary? I lost one of my paper slips. Now this is conflict, get it? Shut up. Interviews. "I want a world without argument and war." Slow down. Everyone is unique. Oui's favourite fruit is dragon fruit. - The text is almost complete. - I'll work on the layout. - Bitch. - My back hurts. I want a sofa. I'm hungry. Found a good book, now] don't want to go out. Becoming a believer. Hi, Teacher. I brought you the sample layout. I like brown. Can we change the text to brown? The rules say red. When are you going to Austria? After graduation. That's soon. Another day gone. Can you not go? Come on. OK, I won't go. Yaaaayyyy! Really? Yeah. Is that your choice? Or do you feel a force controlling you? Exchanging memories. I'm not allowed in the school. Don't worry, nobody's around. - Open the cover. - Oh. Duh... What's the picture for? The school yearbook. I'll take one of you. Why? I'm not a student here. I know. One, two, three. My lips are sealed. Am I dreaming? It's real, not a dream! Shit, you're not even in the picture. Content. I'm so content. - You're such a slut. - Proud of it too. What's up? I got M.'s number for you. Incomplete connection. But it's missing the last two digits. Shit, what am I going to do with it? Count down? Count down from 99 to 00. Or Count Dracula? - I'd rather Count Dracula. - Is that a fucking joke? I don't know. Feeling chilly. A chill in my bones. Don't be poetic. Put a sweater on. Plain as heather grey. A sweater won't help this chill. You're annoying. Cherish those you love. Just tell him. Be confident. Really? OK, I will. So did you confess your love? No, I'm not ready. Uncertainty is exciting. How else will he know? But if I tell him, he'll know. Can he tell me first? Like when he told me his name? Then keep waiting. Running through music videos. MV LOVE CONFESSIONS You're doing research? Improve upon it. I've got to be better than an MV. Don't copy song lyrics. Last night dreamt I went swimming, but the bikini was ugly. What's wrong? Nervous? I had a nightmare. Is it an omen? See and then like? Or like and then see? When I tell him, which sentence should I use? Just tell him. M... Hey. Can you stand here? It's a nicer angle. What is it? Please wait here. And I'll tell you. I'll be right back. Please wait. Floating. I want to ﬁnd my diary. I don't have it. I'm scared. When will we know? Cherish the one you love. - Just tell him. - OK, I will. We always change our minds. There might be something better out there. - Is he the one? - Fuck! Confused. Confession. l've liked you ever since I first saw you. I don't know why... I don't like you. I'm sorry. A life without expectations is peaceful. Thinking back, it really did happen. I'm in bad shape. Everyone's worried. Even I'm worried. It's OK. I'll be going then. I really do care. I do. Dear Diary, please come back to me. My memory is full. Make a ﬁst and spin around. Flower or cobweb? Alone. Love closes your eyes. Really. Like. You. Can I choose my translating work? Some stories are so sad. And the translator gets sad too. Heartbreak. Grain. Teacher, is 400 ASA too grainy? That's what we have. So just use it. 400 ASA is all-purpose anyway. Nothing is valuable in abundance. No more waiting for magic hour? Is this too many photos for one day? No more sincerity when things get serious. Go proof this. No mistakes on the school history chapter. OK. I'll read it tonight. Enjoying "Life of Pie". Good movie. Wong Kar-wai is great. Even his tiger seems lonely. That's not a Wong Kar-wai movie. So much to do. Almost as much as things I want to do. Hurry up and proof it. I'll do it. Just give me a moment. Snap out of it. Everybody's ﬁne. I'm fine. I'm fine means I'm not fine, remember? I'm fine, really. What's next? What's next? Tired, tired, tired, tired. Don't cry, it'll be OK. I'll go buy you a Red Bull. Are you OK being alone? Be back soon. Things happen so easily, quickly, and are never deﬁnite... A girl has been found murdered. No one has yet been arrested. The police are still looking for clues. Thai Buddhist year 2556. Not used to it yet. 2556, SURl IS GONE Whatever happens, life goes on. Suri loved you, didn't you know? Trust your heart, it doesn't lie. This is Suri's diary. Read it. In my dreams there is only you. Don't ask me why, I just feel it. The world used to be so lonely. l have a crush on you. Be prepared. And wait. It's OK to dream. Was she writing about you? I need more explanation. Say it's not you. The hardest path is compromise. Why? lt's forbidden. You'll be expelled. Give me a moment. I'm confused. No, it's not me. Being correct is often a boundary. Remember or forget, which is better? Suri couldn't stay here. That's why she applied to study abroad. And then one day she just changed her mind. It wasn't me, was it? Too much for one day. Making soup, used half a jar of sugar. Mary, come out and make us some soup. Go away! Bought more books. Can books buy me more time? - Mary, the books you ordered are here. - They're not mine! Be still and it will be OK. Damn dog took my bra. Mary Malony, come and get your bra from the office. Forgot to use the aubergine. Mary, do you have an aubergine? Aladdin, I want to ask you something. WHO IS ALADDIN? Teacher, my head's feeling weird. All sorts of strange thoughts. Boredom is normal. Looks normal. You're fine. It's like I can't control anything. Finally, life is turbulent. But life is out of our control. Wake up to a beautiful world. I know you're sad, but you still need eight hours' sleep. And things will be beautiful again. I like to sweep. Heartbreak and loss can sometimes lead to better things in life. Tragedy has a silver lining. Heartbreak and loss has a silver lining? Don't I have a say in anything? Stay calm. Just smile and be happy. Stop me when I lose it. 15 SECONDS TO HAPPINESS I'll give you a book to read. It will help you. Repeat after me. Mary is happy. Mary is happy. Mary is happy. - Are you hypnotising me? - Mary is happy. May tomorrow be better. You want to fight it? Go ahead and try! Who was that? Why did he hit you? I forgot what I've done. Wearing heels to wash the car and people stare. Trying to organise my life. It's not so bad. I won't let you control me. Diary. Step 1: list weird events in chronological order. On. Shit! Collecting memories today. Hold on. The cloud's going to clear in five seconds. OK. Ready? One, two, three. So pretty... It's worth waiting for magic hour. Finally took your photo. Completed the mission last night. Want to wake up to daydreams. Everything begins and ends with the heart. My friend Winai, haven't seen him in ages. I'm Winai, remember me? Enough of this! Please leave me alone. I dreamt of 56. M. 180-620-59 Dialling down my emotions. What are you doing? I don't know. But I need to get out of here. What's up with you? Nobody understands me better than me. Travelling to collect (sea) miles. Hello, Teacher. All I know is that I'm never going back to school again. You want me back now? OK, coming now then. Hi, Teacher. Sunday noon, gather everyone for the class photo. Getting busy with other people's work. But if we shoot at noon, the light's not pretty. Our headmaster is available at noon. He must be in the photo. Keep your feelings to yourself. I'm not allowed to have an opinion. Good. Now you're following orders. You didn't listen to me, and everything's a mess. Will the AV teacher be available? Our headmaster will be there. See you at noon. I've told everyone. Our headmaster moved it to 1:00pm. Call everyone again. OK. Let's settle it, please. I know things I don't want to know. And vice-versa. - Our headmaster's not coming. - Why not? None of your business. Proceed without him. OK, one... Finished. Old enough to understand. You've ruined the yearbook! You're not allowed any opinion. Did you forget? I've said my piece. So be it. Today, tomorrow, what's the difference? Tannase is an enzyme. What? Got to tell someone something. Help! Just watch, don't detain. OK, time's up. Come out. How are you? Getting better all the time. What's wrong with you? Talking to yourself? Locking yourself in your room? Acting aggressively? Losing myself recently. There's no escape. I love him. My phone charger is the culprit. I'm going to die from an electric shock. Haven't you had enough of that phone? Teacher... Do similars attract? Or opposites? I think that... ...there are no easy answers in life. It never goes as planned. Nobody can teach us how to live. To each his own. There's no escape. I love him. My heart... My heart is meeeeeelting. Hello, M.? Yes, I called you. But my phone exploded. You're nearby? Can I come and see you? Please? I've come a long way. My departure might be someone else's arrival. - Is this the yearbook sample? - Yes. I wish it were thinner. I like it thick. It looks expensive. Nothing can be changed. Is the cover finished? Could it be tomorrow? Can I have one more day? I'm still thinking of the design. OK, but you won't think of anything. Can't think of anything. Addicted to banana cake. Working from reason is easier than working from emotion. If we use our heads more than our wallets, each day would be happier. Everything reminds. We'll forget each other. I've chosen. That's it. Rain and dreams. To collect, you ﬁrst have to save. Suri, | wish you would come back. Nouvelle Vague, I've loved you for a long time. Hello, Mr Godard. I love your films. Thanks. Reality loves dreams. But dreams don't know. That's why life is somewhere in between. I can't separate dreams from reality any more. I'm confused. It's all so weird. I think I'm going crazy. Someone saw you shooting a gun into the sky. Out of gas, going crazy. I lost control. Mary, repeat after me. Mary is happy. Back to the same method. Mary is happy. Listen to me. Don't fight it. There's no other way. Take it and read it. If we have too many beliefs, we have no belief at all. Still thinking "Life of Pie". Breaking news: a pile-up at a gas station. The incident occurred in the outskirts of the city. The explosion caused the entire station to disappear. Gas station disappears? Mary is happy. Mary is happy. Mary is happy. Mary is happy. Making yoghurt according to formula. Mary follows formula. Mary follows formula. 53 people were injured at the scene... I feel nothing. Mary finds the world beautiful. Mary finds the world beautiful. Mary finds the world beautiful. I'm Pakorn. Do you remember me? I'm still single. I'm happy that you like me. But this is my space, go ﬁnd your own - from "After Life ". I'm here for the yearbooks. 20kg? My arm's going to drop off. My sixth slice of ham. Hey. Sign here. Here? Honestly, what do you think of the yearbook? Honestly? Mangosteen cover? What were you thinking? Are you our headmaster's mistress? You're so much better than this. No more working for others (for free). It's tiresome and it's not even mine. Bye. Sign in. YEARBOOK STAFF - MARY MALONY, SURl AKSORNSAWANG OK, I'm up! I can't even follow myself, never mind following others. DREAMING | WAS AWAKE Everyday counts. PLEASE WAIT HERE AND l'LL TELL YOU I like you. Please cooperate with my love. It's OK. I've been through this before. Tonight belongs to Jens Lekman. Graduation stick-up? What flavour? Red Bull flavour. Final exams? You think I'm sleepy? Why must we study for exams? In the end, does it make anything better? WHY DOES OUR HEADMASTER LlKE MANGOSTEEN? (30 MARKS) So what if he likes mangosteen? I don't get it. We still need to study each other, even without exams. I'm going to fail. These subjects are useless anyway. Just read it. Don't question everything. Mary. Mary. Are you asleep with your eyes open? I miss Suri. Dreaming with your eyes open is so different. We've been together since the follow button. If we understand ourselves, then others will understand us. LOVE HAS CONFLICTS, ALWAYS Interesting question YOU WANT TO TAKE A WALK WITH ME? I don't want to be sad. But I am. I love you too, Suri. 4:00am is 60 minutes after 3:00am. Drunk in the daytime. Are you drunk? Exams did this to you? It's so hard, can't bring it up. Excuse me... Can you bring it up here? - No. - l'll jump down then. Friday, it's hot. Tired in every way. There are two different kinds of loss. Temporary loss. And permanent loss. Take care, OK? Will I see you again? See you around. When I talk to myself, I don't want to talk to others. No questions, no answers. The sun goes up, the sun goes down. And that's a day. Call me. 4 + 3 = 8. Nothing is certain. If we could practise our feelings, today I'd practise happiness. It's going to be hard. I feel what I feel. Wake up. OK, I'm up! Love is uncertain. But today it's gone. If you put your mind to it, three minutes is enough. M., I wanted to say... Wish I had the words. Kid. Just flip a coin to call or not. The beneﬁt of keeping loose change. Packing my money, my heart, myself. Thank you for loaning me the filters. You've had these since 7th grade. Going to have to make my own ﬁlters. - So you've graduated? - Yes. - Hey. - Hi. Too much of a coincidence? Didn't think we'd meet again. How are you? I'm fine. Everything's ﬁne. You're going home? Excuse me? What did you say? Excuse me? What did you say? Goodbye to high heels. That's it. Electric shock again. Take care of your ear. Thank you, Teacher. Wake me up at 10:00, but I'll try to be up at 9:00. People need love. No man is an island. l was born in Thailand, a Buddhist, with no choice for my name. Am I even mine? The song stops suddenly. That's it. CALCULATING FUTURE PROBABILITY VOL. 4 The unknown never reveals itself through study. Can't breathe fast enough for this air. Back home. With mountains. Mum, when did this mountain appear? Last week. An all-purpose life is pretty hard to use. What do you want to do next? I don't know. Anything, Mum. Up to you. Wait a moment...
