Ministry of Culture of RF "Globus" Film Studio GRAND Company Group present a Sergei Snezhkin film BURY ME BEHIND THE BASEBOARD based on the novella by Pavel Sanayev Director of Photography Vladislav GURCHIN Production Designer Maria GRIN' Music by Svyatoslav KURASHOV Producers: Vladimir ZHELEZNIKOV Mikhail LITVAK Leonid LITVAK Starring: Grandson - Sasha DROBITKO Grandmother - Svetlana KRYUCHKOVA Grandfather - Alexei PETRENKO Mother - Maria SHUKSHINA Tolik - Konstantin VOROBYOV Well, didn't I tell you? Cheese, that's the catch. It was tempted by Dutch cheese, but not by Russian. Here you go. Sadist! What have you done, sadist? Why did you kill him? Well, you asked me to. What did I ask you? I couldn't ask you to do anything of the kind! I thought he would get pressed just a bit, and you got him cut in half. And it's just a little mouse. It'd be different if it were a big mouse. And he's so little. Look at him, he's happy that he just killed a living soul. And if somebody would break your backbone? - Where are you taking him? - To the lavatory. Don't you dare to do that. Do you expect me to take him to the cemetery? Put him here. Here you are. That's it. Poor little thing. Wake up, you little monster. It's 8 o'clock already. Tonya is coming soon to take your blood samples. Perspired? Get up. Nina, I think the expiry date is up. It has blown. Blown? Where? Good caviar. If you're given free rein, you'll throw away everything. Oh, I'll give it to Galina Sergeyevna. Granny, what day is it today? What? Why? Well, there's a pull-off calendar on the wall especially for softheads. Where's your "good morning"? Good morning. 29... It's 29th today? And who's going to wash up? Pushkin? To the bathroom, quick! Idiot! This stinking old man used this towel yesterday. He's got athlete's foot! Wash up once again! Sasha! What? I've caught the mouse. - Really? Where? - Over there. Got you. Why didn't you let Granny sleep, running in the kitchen, you rascal? Don't you dare touch him. You don't need jaundice to add to all your other diseases. Granddad, what was the bait? Dutch cheese. He didn't like Russian. Can I take him? And bury him behind the baseboard? - Where? - Behind the baseboard. It's just the right place for him there - it's cosy and I can always check how he's lying there. What an idiot! I wish I could put all of you behind that baseboard. You've murdered a living soul and feel excited about it - murderers. Why should I eat these apples every day? You silly boy, it's good for you, it eliminates waste products. - What waste products? - All kinds. But why are they grated? Because you don't chew properly, damn you. You gulp down everything so nothing is ingested. Ungrateful piece of shit. I'm sparing no effort for his sake and he just turns up his nose at it. Eat! Just three more pills. Well, here they are. You'll take Pancreatin first and then Multivitamin. Understand? Yes? Here. Yes? No. Stick this present up your own ass! - Have you taken your pills? - Yes. You have, haven't you? I'll drink all of your blood, lousy shrimp. Just try to play this trick once again, you louse. I'll strangle you with my own hands. Tadpole! Go, do you homework! Little scum! - Yes. - Don't you 'yes' me! What? Bought a present. Let her give it to her alky. Why didn't you say it to her yourself? Well, you took the phone. Thank you. Well? Can't see a damn thing. Windows are frozen and I'm frozen. Again? Why again? I'm really cold. Just 50 grams to warm up a bit. - Don't you want some? - I'm not cold. And to keep up your spirits? We're to see the kid. Have you called? I have. Well? I was told to fuck off. What else could you expect? Well, I will have some brandy - to warm up and to brave up myself. Tolya. Tolya! - What shall we do? - Well, call again! Yes? Did you get through? In two hours they're going to see a homeopath. Some brandy? Come on, stop it, you'll reek of alcohol on the kid. It'll go away in two hours. Besides, I'm not sure they'll let you even near the kid. I'm his mother. Mother. Good morning. Do you sell it? - How much? - It's not mine. I'll give you 60 rubles. Have you heard me? It's not mine. Do you have a present for him? Here it is. What's that? Tiddly-winks. See - 50 points. Yeah... Well, and what did he want? Me. He wanted me. Me to come. Found a laundrywoman for their stinky underpants, a free servant. Well, doesn't matter, my days are numbered. What do you want? - Granddad, what day is it today? - Thursday. And the date? Why? My birthday is on the 28th. - Who told you that? - Nobody. I remember from the last year. I've kept the calendar page not to forget. My mom must come to see me on this day. I don't know. Ask your granny what day it is. - I will. - So go and ask. - And I will. - Do try. I will try. You deliberately tore off calendar's pages so that I don't know it's my birthday and so that my mom doesn't come! You know what, you little snot! How dare you! Get out of here. What are you doing here? He asked what date it was today. Why? He claims today is his birthday and his mom will come to see him. Rascal! Your mommy is the Black Death, if she ever comes, it'll be only to your grave. And your birthday will be when I tell. Have you done your homework? - I have. - Come on, I'll check. The sun is rising... Why is that here, you scumbag? Working only under the whip-lash, scum. I'll erase not this letter - I'll erase you. For the second year already have been studying on razors. I wish all these razors would stick into your throat. Throwing light from rosysy... Rosysy? You snake! Come here, skunk. Come, or it'll be only worse. Come here or I'll slice you into pieces with this razor. Come here, don't be a coward. Halt. Halt. I won't do anything to you. Come here, Sasha dear! I'll give you a chocolate bar. Come here. I'll buy some toy carriages for your railway. And if you don't come, I'll buy them and break them right on your head! Come here like a good boy. Come on, I'll see if you're perspiring. I won't! Rosysy sunrise... I wish you haven't seen any more sunrises. Bastard! How can you torment me so and suck blood out of your granny! I kept telling your mother: "Study, be independent" I'm telling you the same - all in vain! You'll be just like her - the same dependant piece of shit! Are you going to study, you damned scum, are you going to? Are you going to study... Grandma, what's wrong with you? Will you study well?! Don't do that, please! Please, I'm scared! Go away, boy. I don't know you. I'm not your grandmother, I have no grandson. White ceiling, white... Ninochka... So white... Jesus Christ! Oh, my God! My God! What have you done to her, rascal? I'll kill you like a rabid dog! She fell down herself! I'll call a doctor! Call a doctor for yourself! What's wrong with you? He drove me mad, that's what is wrong with me. Well, let's go and do your homework. That'll be your place as long as you live. Your move. Well, I'm bored with this stupid game. Why stupid? You've been playing it for an hour. Look, it's really been an hour. I'll die from cold here. - Give me some money. - Don't have any. - None at all? - None at all. Where from? Take it. It's not yours, isn't it? - Now it's mine. - 50 rubles. You said 60. 60 - when it was not yours. And now it's 50. OK. Excuse me. You should look in here. Would you... It's Foma's binoculars. I'll buy him a new one. - Where are you going? - Just a second! Breathe. Stack of bones. Turn around. Bronchitis? Yes. You know him as well as any doctor, Nina Antonovna. If not better. Get dressed. Oh, Galina Sergeyevna, a poor martyr this kid is. You know there's a saying: for the sins of their parents. >> This kid is paying for the sins of his slut mother. I see you've been crying today, Nina Antonovna? How can I help it? Have I ever thought, when I got married, what a life I'd have. He promised me a rose garden, and what an acting career I could have had in Kiev, what roles! Give me a spoon. Open your mouth. Wider. - Red? - Yes. Tonsils are enlarged. Well, I'm running! From the bottom of my heart, Galina Sergeyevna. Oh, no, Nina Antonovna, don't. It's so embarrassing. Don't mention it. It's nothing. It's for your work, for your care. All the best, Sasha. Get well. From your mouth to God's ears. - See you tomorrow. - All the best. Thank you very much. Soiled the floor, pig. Even though she's a doctor. Why are you standing like a lamp-post? Dear granny. Please let it be my birthday today, please. Dearest granny, I'll do well at school, do all my homework, I won't hide under the bed any more, just let it be my birthday. Get up. Never kiss the dust, never behave like this slut, your mother. Licking that alky's feet so that he wouldn't leave her. I know why you want it to be your birthday. You want to see her, don't you? - Do you? - No, not at all. I just want a birthday with presents like everybody else. I don't want to see my mother. Why, haven't I seen enough of her? Are you telling the truth? - You're not lying to me? - I'm telling the truth. Just remember. When a person is lying, he gets scared and his vessels get constricted and his blood starts to rot until worms get into his blood and eat him up. And you're already rotten within. Do remember. No one needs you except your granny. Only granny spits blood for you all her life. OK, we'll go to see a homeopath now and then we'll see. Where have you been? I'm asking, where have you been? Here you are. I bought him a real present - not some obscure tiddly-winks. How much? 40 rubles. Tolya dear... Well, what? We'll earn money. It's not about money. You'll give it to him. - Well, I'm off. - Wait. Have you seen 300 rubles? I haven't. I stuffed it in here, in this can. My business is to bring money, yours - to sock it away. You must have stuffed it in some book as usual. No. I put 500 rubles in a book. And 300 I placed in a can. - When did the plumber come? - On Monday. That's him, Romka, the plumber. He didn't even leave the bathroom. O yes, he did fuck you up, you senile man, with his fishing stories. And you softened up like a piece of shit in a sunny spot. In the meantime he sneaked into the the kitchen and 300 rubles... Have disappeared. You see, and you accused Romka... 500. And where are 300? Granny, you stuffed them into the dog. - What dog? - Porcelain dog in the kitchen. One, two, three, four - four hundred. And where are 300? The doctor stole them! Yes, it's her. What a viper. Sanctimonious bitch. And I was wondering why she didn't go to wash her hands in the bathroom - preferred to go to the kitchen. And she bought a new coat. Where did she get the money for it with her salary of 100 rubles? Nina, let's open a bank account. Then you'll calm down. You want to calm me down? You don't have to wait long. Want to whore with some young girl. You, the idol of the millions, you hope that your dick will get a rise after my death? Modern medicine is powerless against impotence. You want to put all the money into a bank account? All the money in one place? Great idea. I'll die and all the money are right here on the account, so that some perky tits takes it and spends it. No. Let her search, maybe she even read some books. Nina, I need to warm-up the engine. Do it. Oh boy, damn it. The heater doesn't work. Granny. Don't talk, or the oil will run out of your nose. - Granny. - What do you want? Let's take the mouse with us. - What for? - We can bury him in the yard. Good idea. Daddy! How do you do! What the hell have you come for? Why? It's Sasha's birthday today. We want to wish him all the best. We've bought him a present. Why the hell have you brought along this jerk? Tolya also wants to congratulate him. He bought him a present. Fuck him, he won't see Sasha. Frozen? Let me try. Dad, how could you? It's the kid's birthday. He has a birthday only once in a year and where is his mother hanging about for the rest of the year? It's you who don't let me near him. And we won't. He doesn't have a mother! His mother is his granny who is slaving away while you are with your easy-rider... What... What are you doing, bastard? All the drivers do that when it gets frozen. - See? - I'll kill you, bastard! Calm down, you! Just look at yourself! Calm down, all the drivers do it! Dad! Dad! Police! Call the police! Let's go home. Bugger off, you laureate! Where are you going? Daddy! Don't you, slut, touch me! You bastard! What are you doing? Are you hurt? You pain in the ass in a sheepskin coat. You want this street to be named after you, don't you? Tolya, wait! I'm not afraid of you, scumbag. You don't have to be afraid of me. Just remember me, you Party bitch. Oh dear, I'm so scared. I'll be the last one you remember. Do go and have a drink. I'll get you even at the Novodevichy cemetery! What? - You got it? - You spongers. You are living on my money, and you dare to insult me! Stinky scapegraces. What money is he talking about? I beg you, let's go. And what money are you living and drinking on all this time? Hasn't she told you that I'm sending her 100 rubles each month? - Is it true? - True, true. The sheepskin coat is bought with my money and the boots, and the bra that you're taking off her. What are you staring at? Don't like to hear the truth? Here, choke on it! Want the bra too? Wear it. We don't need your junk. We'll pay you back. We'll pay you back every kopeck. We'll be waiting. All your bloody money! Why do you look so messed up? The heater is broken. I've been trying to fix it. - What do you mean - broken? - Well, it doesn't work. Are you nuts, you old moron? You want the kid to get frozen in this fridge? Well, we'll have to cancel your visit then. I'll go to a repair shop to fix the heater. Cancel? It took me 6 months to get the appointment, and he says 'cancel'! Old fucker! I'm going to cancel you forever! Damn you, stinking moron! May you be cursed by heaven, God, earth, birds, fish, people! Come here, you sluggish pig, come on, you rotten shit, sit down on your granny's knee. Traitor. Even your car is black - colour of villainy. In 1937 they were taking away people in such cars. This is my mom's coat! Shut up. He saw the coat. What are you babbling? Do you have fever? - It's her coat! - He's got him frozen! You've got your way - got the kid frozen! Old devil! It's her coat! You killed her, and took the coat to sell it! You killed her, you damned stinking old man! You've got to me! Shut up! No one killed your mom. Who the hell needs her? She's alive, alive. What can happen to her with her alky? She herself threw the coat to me. True, it's Olga's coat - as cheap as its owner. Where did you get it from, you bumpkin? She was here. Mother came to see me and I haven't seen her! Calm down! Or I'll calm you down forever. When did she come? When I was starting up the engine. She came with her alky. And why did she give you the coat? It's her coat, right? Oh yeah, it's hers! I gave her the money to buy it! Bastard, I don't allow myself any extra piece, saving money on everything to be able to pay for the kid's medicines and doctors. And he buys sheepskin coats for some sluts! My mother came! My mother will get cold! You've taken away her coat so that she'll get frozen and die! You're not my grandfather any more. You're a bastard! I'll glue up your mouth! Son of a bitch. It's you who is an ungrateful bastard. And you're a scum! - She won't get frozen. - She will! It's -25° outside, you both are wearing fur coats! Well, what's happened here? Junior lieutenant Kruglikov. So what? And I'm People's Artist Savelyev. What's up? You stopped in the middle of the road - in the way of the traffic. Excuse us, comrade militiaman. You see, the kid's not well. Please, let us go on. We're going to see a doctor. - We never penalize such people. - Thank you, the boy is an invalid. Comrade Savelyev played the role of Militia Colonel in that movie, where the diamonds were stolen. Mr. Militiaman, they killed my mother! He killed her, he got her frozen! Nina, do something, calm him down or I won't control myself. Let's go! Hopefully motherwort extract will take effect soon! - Yes, go on. - What are you staring at? The child is hysterical! Do we have money for a taxi? 8 rubles 74 kopecks. Buy something for yourself. I know, you want to. It's OK, I'll survive. Let's go home. What are we waiting for? They'll be back in an hour, an hour and a half. Haven't you had enough? It's his birthday. Let him at least see me from a distance. I'll wave to him with this box. He'll understand it's a present. And that I can't come closer. What's that? It's rice straw. He perspires and the straw absorbs moisture. - Really? - Yes. And why is he so listless? He fell asleep in the car, he's car sick. Oh, I see. What's your name? Sasha. Aleksandr. And what is your patronymic? I don't have a father. I've never seen him and I don't know his name. That's why I don't know my patronymic. How is school? How are you doing there? I study at home, because whenever I go to school, I get sick. School is full of bacilli carriers and freaks that go there in order to infect each other. Happy birthday, chap. Have I told you the story how my mother had broken my leg? No. I was about 8 then, just like him. It was summer. We were walking along Gorky Street, she was pulling me by the hand. Just for a second I stopped in front of a showcase to look at a mannequin. A very beautiful mannequin, in a red silk dress. But she kept pulling me. I dug my heels in. It was such a beautiful dress. She hit me with her leg right here. Oh! When did that happen? When you fell down. My last pair of pantyhose. My God, what for? Why is today such an unlucky day? Shall we go home? No, I shall wait. My son has a birthday today. And you may go. And why are you so skinny, Sasha? Because I'm very ill. I have orange pathogenic staphylococcus, parietal antritis, sinusitis, frontal sinusitis, tonsillitis inveterate, pancreatitis, congenital pancreatitis, kidney failure, and then something's wrong with my liver, I don't remember exactly what. That's a lot. With my diseases I'm paying for the sins of my slut mother. You see? Just a kid, but he understands everything. She abandoned him, exchanged him for an alky dauber. Placed the kid on my shoulders as a heavy cross, and I've been carrying it for 6 years. I'll prescribe arnica for the beginning. And pulsatilla-6 as a depressant. I give him motherwort. - Don't give him motherwort. - All right. Is your mother an actress, too? A shit of an actress she is - from some dreadful theatre. And why is granny saying that you've made a fortune on people's tears? And built a palace with beads. These beads? Don't pay attention, Aron Moiseyevich. He's sick in the head. Do apologize immediately. There's no need to if he's sick. He'll apologize when we get him cured. Thank you, Aron Moiseyevich. Stand still. Wait in the lobby. I need to talk to your granny. What took you so long? I nearly died from cold. Now you know how cold the kid was. He couldn't lift his ass to fix the heater. Never mind, you'll remember this trip till the end of your life. Get in! I wish your fucking car would fall to pieces just like my whole life fell to pieces. 'T ook so long' The doctor was examining the child. What's this examination for? Examine or not examine - just a waste of money. What? - Granny. - What, my sweetie pie? We wanted to bury the mouse properly. - Stop! - Why? Pull over by the park. Well... That's it. Throw a handful of snow into the grave with your left hand. What for? That's the way it should be done at the funeral. Don't forget to do the same at my funeral. Is he going to be here all the time? May I visit him sometimes? He'll be eaten by worms or crows. We should mark his grave in some way. - A cross? - He hasn't been christened. A cross is placed only on the graves of Christians. Here, we'll put a twig. That's it. You're my little mouse. When I think of you in a grave, my heart just sinks. I just can't breathe. Jesus Christ! What is this kid suffering for? O God, pass all Sasha's diseases on to me. Curse his mother, this lustful shit, may she suffer at least for one day the way this child is suffering. Granny, I don't want to lie in the snow. Bury me behind the baseboard. Worn out, worn to the thread. Where was she roaming about in it? Some back alleys with her alky? Seams are all greasy like a janitor's jacket's. No dry cleaning will help. That's what this bitch made of an expensive garment. My Lady Patroness! Save and protect us! Why didn't you buy her a sable coat! Hold on for a second. And a diamond necklace for her battered face. I'm speaking with a film crew. You should call the professor, you old camel, and not flirt with female assistants over the phone. Let me finish... It was discovered that your grandson has mucoviscidosis, and he's blabbing off with assistants director. Let me finish and I'll call the professor. Go on, finish. And I'll listen. Hello? And what is it about? Civil War? Red partisans? Good theme, a timely one. Who's directing? I don't know him. One of the young ones? Horse riding? Let the stuntmen do the horse riding. How many shooting days? That's good. Do you know my fee? No. It was some time ago, now I'm paid 90 rubles per a shooting day plus 75% for rehearsals, and 50 - for voice-over. And what have you expected, my dear? I'm USSR People's Artist, State Prizewinner - not some fucking extra. That's it. Call me back. For 50 rubles a day. They'd better look for some other idiot. Call the professor. Professor. Professor... Well, Professor Kalish. Another Jew. Why a Jew? Kalish is a Ukrainian name. Look at his first name and patronymic. Mikhail Semyonovich. Semyonovich. I see. - Shall I call him? - Sure, call! He's a real expert on mucoviscidosis. You have to make an appointment with him a year in advance. Promise him anything - tickets for any private screenings in the House of Cinema, White Hall, a voucher to Pitsunda resort. Kiss his Jewish ass but make him see us this week. Tolya. What? Have you had Jews in your family? - Who? - Jews. I don't think so. Why do you ask? You look like a Jew. Really? The deuce knows. Well, and if I do, so what? I think that they've taken you for a Jew. Your old folks went nuts. Let's take this sink of degeneracy by storm, take Sasha with us and burn their apartment. And where will my parents live? Just where they should live - in a madhouse. Look, who was your first husband? A man, an actor. And what was his nationality? I'll go and try to call. Go, go. He was a nice, weak man. And I'm strong and bad, and look like a Jew. 50. Look. Do I look like a Jew? Not really. Thank you. Mucoviscidosis... - What's this... - Mucoviscidosis... Mu-co-vis-cidosis. Thank you. Let's go. What is it now? Sasha. Our Sasha has mucoviscidosis. What is that beast? I don't know exactly, but this is something horrible. Let's go. Wait. Waitress! - , please. - Don't have it. What do you have? Some foreign pop-music. OK, it'll do. Sasha? Sasha dear, where are you? Answer me, you freak! Are you hiding under the bed again, bastard? I'll kill you. Just wait. Not here. Idiot! You're allergic to dust. You'll have a rash all over again. Where have you got this habit of hiding in holes like a cockroach! Feverish! I knew it. Hi, Lika. Do you have a medical encyclopedia? Will you please look up "mucoviscidosis". I'll wait. Sasha has it. Today, Lika. Mucoviscidosis. Mu-co-visci-dosis. Doesn't sound nice. Like an accident at a grain storage. Don't interfere. I'm not interfering, I'm thinking. Let's have our own baby. A boy or a girl. And leave this one to granny if she wants him so much. Why should we hurt the old lady? Why not? We'll have a healthy kid. Buy him good books. "Golden Key", about Urfin Jus, and not those infectious diseases reference books. Can you come here? - What? - For a second. Do you hear me, Olya? Olya, I found this mucoviscidosis. Had too much brandy, alky? What are you talking about? I was speaking not to you. Dictate. So, mu-co-vis-ci-dosis. Cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, a genetic disease, affecting endocrine glands. Etiology - mutation of genes. Symptoms: Noisome feces, there's a threat of the rectum prolapsus. Well? It's bad. What bad? Talk sense! Most serious infectious disease transmitted genetically. Practically incurable... Well... Bad luck. What do you mean? Is he going to die or what? What are you doing, you fool! You've said it yourself 'incurable'! Think before saying. Whatever you say is as if you're biting. What have I said? You'd better think about what we are going to do! What? My sheepskin coat. - I'll put on a jacket. - Wait. So you will come there, and what next? Are you coming? OK, we'll come and they won't open the door. Let them try not to. It seems like they've been trying it for six years now. And it looks like they're very good at it. It's immoral to criticize without offering a positive program. Speaking of a positive program. Even if they let you in... Go ahead, say it. They won't let me have my son anyway? Your mother... To put it mildly, is a weird girl. But now... Especially with... - With mucoviscidosis. - Right. It would be better for Sasha to stay with her. With them. Are you saying I should forget about my son? Why 'forget'? What role are you playing here? For whom? There're no spectators with flowers. You'd better decide for yourself- do you really need this kid with all his diseases? Are you capable of taking care of him like this crazy woman does? Sorry. There's another way out. What? We'll separate. And you'll go back to your family. And all the problems will be solved of their own accord. They'll just disappear. So you decided to run away? What can I do with such a woman? Can you make at least one decision? For yourself? For us? For your son? It's you who should understand one thing. Whatever I decide - they won't let me have the child. It doesn't matter... ...whether we're separated or we're together. They'll find some other excuse, some other reason. Because they hate me. Me. And here's an enema with camomile. Lie down on your side, like a wolf in the wild. I'll give you a camomile shot, and no more fever you got. Your granny is really something, giving it out in verse. Come on, turn around. Tell me straight, will I have a birthday or not? Same old stew again? Only healthy kids have birthdays. Healthy. - Are you healthy? - No. Then what the hell do you want from me? So I'm not having a birthday? - No. - Never? Well, maybe next year. Though it's unlikely. To live for one day with such a diagnosis is good enough. You should thank your mommy and her lover for that. It's him who infected you with this staphylococcus. How come? He gave you some unwashed grapes. Deliberately. He wanted you to die. This scumbag has a wicked plan. To move to Moscow and to lay his hands on everything we have - our flats, your granddad's car, garage - all our property. And in order to do that, he needs all of us to be dead. So when I die, what property will he get? No property. What property do you have? Nothing but your health record. Then why does he want me dead? Because when you die, I'll also die, and then the granddad will die. And he'll move into our apartment and sell all our belongings. So for him you're a pain in the ass. And my mom? Your mom is eating out of his hand, she's in cahoots with him. No one needs us, Sasha, we're on our own. In this world we're surrounded by traitors. We are both betrayed; your mom exchanged you for this murderer, your granddad has been cheating on me all my life. Do you think that I've always been so old, ugly and toothless? You think that I've been screaming and crying all my life? No. I was an actress, yes. The entire Kiev was going to the theatre to admire me. I was called " the hope of the Ukrainian stage". Then the Moscow Art Theatre came to Kiev on tour. That's when I met your granddad. As an actor he was absolute zero. But he looked so imposing. So handsome. Every day we had a date. He took me to the theatre and I took him to Andreyevsky Spusk. And to the beach. Then it was time for him to go back. And he says to me... "Let's get married and I'll take you to Moscow". I was already in love with him. And I said: " Go to my parents and ask their permission". I didn't know, stupid girl... ...that he did it for a dare. He had a woman in Moscow who was 10 years older than he. They had a fight and he bet that he'd find someone better in Kiev. And he did, the idiot. We got married, showed the marriage certificate to my father, and I left. My father was running after the train: "Don't go away, my little girl!" As if he felt that I'd know only grief and tears here. I shouldn't have left Kiev and my parents. What a fool I was. He brought me to Moscow to a 9 sq. M-room. We lived there for 14 years until finally we got an apartment. It's been such a trial living with a slow-witted man, Sasha. I was inquisitive. I wanted to learn things, everything interested me. I asked him so many times: to a museum, to an exhibition. >> No way! He was either busy or tired. And where could I go alone in a strange city? I've only seen the Moscow Art Theatre's productions. Though they were worth of seeing, that theatre was famous then. But even that entertainment was soon over - I had Alyosha. I hate this Moscow. For 40 years I haven't seen anything except misfortunes and tears here. When I lived in Kiev, I was a prime mover everywhere. Young men adored me. And the way I recited Shevchenko's poems! Day dawns, then comes the twilight grey, The limit of the live-long day; For weary people sleep seems best And all God's creatures go to rest. I was enrolled as a student of a Drama School without exams, just for reading the great poet's lyrics. I could have been an actress of the Russian Drama Theatre named after - God, I forgot the name of this slut from Kreschatik Street... Oh yes, Lesya Ukrainka. Hello? Good day, Vera Petrovna. It's still the same thing. I remembered my first child, Alyosha. May his soul rest in peace. Well, when he was born we lived in that 9-meter gas chamber. No, now we live near "Aeroport". Back then we had a room near Gorky Street. No, not only two of us and the child. His relatives came to stay, too. If it wasn't a sister from Tula, then it was a brother or a niece. Yes, certainly, a communal flat, with neighbours. There was a Rozalsky, he worked at the theatre with Senya. We were negotiating who would clean the flat. And they used to tell me: "You have visitors all the time, so you should do it more often." Then the war started. Moscow was bombed. All the theatre actors were evacuated to Alma-Ata. And he was going to Borisoglebsk to film in war movies. And he ordered: " You and the kid will go to Alma-Ata. I'll join you later." All his life he was like that - "later", except his meanness. He's always had it right now. I begged him on my knees: "There's a basement where we can hide during bombardments. I'll wait for you and then we'll go together." He hit the table with his fist: "Do as I said." Showed his mettle. Such wishy-washy doormats always like to assert themselves. Well, so we were transported to that Alma-Ata like a herd of cattle. We arrived and there was no place to live, I wasn't on the theatre staff. So I and Alyosha were accommodated in a basement with the earthen floor. It was cold like ice. That's where I got appendagitis. And then they wanted to throw us out of there. They needed a place for some cleaning woman to live. I said: " Where can I go with a one-year-old baby?" "Since you have a baby," they say, "you can stay for the time being." They showed mercy. And what a boy he was, what a baby! Just over a year old, he already talked. Fair-haired, a doll-like face, with grey-blue eyes. I loved him so much that my heart missed a beat. And in this basement he got sick - diphtheria and measles. Then he got a boil. An abscess in the lung. The doctor said: Gosh, had I been crying. And my boy told me: mom, I won't die. Don't cry. >> Out of breath, coughing but trying to comfort me. He died next day. I carried him to the cemetery with my own hands, and buried him myself. And as I was left alone, they drove me out of this basement, the cleaning woman moved in. So I went to Senya in Borisoglebsk. There I was told: 'There's a good gynaecologist, but you'll have to pay him 100 rubles.' Well, I had only 150 rubles left. I didn't have time to sell vodka, we drank it up, the entire company. Well, I went to see that doctor. He examined me and said: "Do you have children?" And I just buried my son. "You see," he said, " you'll never be able to have children." Can you imagine, Vera Petrovna, hearing something like that at 23. I trusted him and got pregnant with this whore - my daughter. It happened later though, after the war, in Moscow. So I had her, she was sick all the time, with no end. Well, you understand how I doted on her. When she was 5, she got infectious jaundice. Picked up a lump of sugar in the yard and put it into her mouth. And there were rats in the yard almost as tall as she. I saw it and screamed: . But she just stares at me, bitch, and keeps sucking on this sugar. I unclenched her teeth, took it out, but it was too late - she got sick. I spent all the money on her - at the market, I exchanged my stuff for lemons to give her lemon juice with grape-sugar. Where are you going? - For a walk. - Does your granny know? Sure. She dressed me. OK then, go. Thank you. I ate only semolina that was left after her. I cooked some, she ate it all, and I rubbed the pot off with a piece of bread - that was all my food. I cherished such a serpent in my bosom - haven't seen anything from her except hatred. And I had given her everything, Vera Petrovna, the last crumb, the last drop of water. I went around almost naked myself, so that my child had everything. Had she at least once said to me: "Have some porridge, mommy"? Knowing that I had only bread and water. Sure, I'd rather eat resin than her porridge. But at least she could have offered it to me. What are you doing by my car? Get out of here. Good evening. Will you please take me to "Sokol", Abovyan Street? - Where did you get it from? - From my granny. Give it back or I'll take you to the police station. And you know what is driving me crazy most of all? Her father, my husband, doesn't give a damn. Being sick myself, I have to take care of a sick child. And he doesn't give a damn. Ninka will hold out, Ninka is a cart-horse. And even if I die, so what? He's an actor, he's touring around -applause and all that. And I'm sick, scared and humiliated all my life. And I've read so many books, poetry and plays, he couldn't even imagine. Oh well, all for nothing, Vera Petrovna - my life's been wasted. Just for nothing, that's what really hurts. If only my daughter would've grown a real person and justified my tears. She became an actress, married some local crook and gave birth to a cripple. Then she found for herself that alky dauber in Sochi. My husband saw how I suffered raising her. But he thought only about his tours, rehearsals and checkers. Oh yeah, and with his friend Gorbatov they used to walk up and down Gorky Street looking at girls' legs. No! In evacuation it wasn't a real betrayal yet. He did betray me when Olga was 6. She just recovered from infectious jaundice - I felt so weak and helpless that I got depressed. I didn't have any mania. I was just down in the dumps. I tried to explain it, but who would listen to a crazy woman? Then he duped me and sent me to an asylum. Promised it would be a recreation centre, but it turned out to be a madhouse. I started to cry, they started to give me injections. I went skin blisters from top to toe. What are you doing here? Where's your granny? What is this smell? Have you soiled yourself? What are you doing? What are you doing here? You know, Vera Petrovna, I bathe him and feel so tired that I just can't change water. So I bathe myself in his water. And the water is dirty. I can't bathe him more often than twice a week. But I'm not squeamish. I know it's his water, it's like a spring water to me, I'm ready to drink it. I love him like I've never loved anyone. Silly boy, he thinks his mother loves him more than I do. How can she love him more if she has never suffered so much for his sake? He's my everything, I feel what he feels. If I hear him wheezing at night, I give him Zvyagintesva's powder. I get up to tuck him in, check his little dick - if it's tightened, I give him a piss-pot. Being sleepy he wets me all over, but I don't get angry - just laugh. Of course, I scream at him, but it's only because I'm afraid for him. Later on I curse myself for doing that. This kind of love is worse than any punishment. What? Your soup is running over? Yes, of course, Vera Petrovna. Run and take care of it. Thank you for hearing out an old fool. I may feel better because of that. My regards to Svetochka, may you both be healthy. Her soup is running over. She's lying, the bitch. Simply got tired of listening. Well, who wants to listen to other people's troubles? All of them are egoists and traitors. Only you, my sweetie, is by my side, and I want no one else. Damn their attention. Where are you, silly boy? Where are you, bastard? What's that? What does it mean? Where has he been? Lying in the street. What is this stinking smell? Idiot. I gave you a enema. Bring him to the bathroom. Take off his coat! Put him in the bath with all his clothes on. Bastard, I'll never forgive you for that! What a cretin one must be to go out with a temperature of 104. You could have dropped dead right on the street, you freak! What's this? Money for a taxi! Do you want me to walk in such cold weather? Not only you've taken after your mother, idiot, on top of that you're a thief! A thief! If you don't die from your illnesses, you'll end up locked up for life. Senya, pick up the money! They're all in shit. Ah, how white, clean and fastidious we are! Of course, you've got a wife for clearing up all the shit. All my life with you I've lived in shit, and I'll end up in shit! Take the kid. Dry him. There're 500 rubles here, at least. - Well, what did I say? - Where did you take it from? From Gorky! From Gorky... Aren't you ashamed? Look, he's fighting. Ah, you're biting, wolf cub? I'll strangle you, I swear, I will. Shame on you! Your granny has laid down her whole life for you, and to pay her off, you run to our enemies the minute she turns away! I wanted to save her. Granny said that the drunkard wanted to kill her in order to lay his hands on our property! My sweetheart. My darling. Forgive me, the old thing. Forgive me for your mother. He went to defend his mother, my sweetie. That's an example for you! Mother is a traitor, but this sick child wanted to save her! Have you ever done such a thing for me, when I was bleeding, when I was locked in an asylum? There she goes again! Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid, my little one. Don't we feel good together - the two of us? Both of them are waiting when we die - you and me. The habitual landscapes of the winter-time Neva are often disturbed now by such sights. The Big Neva Club of the lovers of winter swimming already incorporates about a thousand Leningrad "polar bears". Today the club got a guest, the young Muscovite Konstantin Charkovsky. His father, Igor Borisovich, a physical fitness teacher, a well-known proponent of training children at an early age, got his son used to icy water when he was literally still in pampers. And these are the young Leningraders. They are only several weeks old. From now on, they're members of the Neva Polar Bear Cubs Club... Strong, you son of a bitch? Take that! Happy birthday, dear Sasha. This is a present from us. Granddad brought it from Finland. A tape recorder? A Japanese tape recorder - a reliable thing. It won't betray you like your mother did. Who allowed you? I gave it to Sasha for his birthday from me and you. Sasha, say 'thank you' to your granddad. I brought this tape recorder for myself. Can I bring something for myself at least once in my life? You always take everything away. What an idea to give a thing that costs 200 dollars to a milksop! Give it back, asshole! Give it to me - I tell you! How dare you to take a present from a sick child? He's always treated you like dirt! You won't see me any more, you bitch, you won't. Are you hurt, dear granny? Don't cry, please, for my sake! I'm not crying, little bun. I'm not crying. I have wept myself out long ago. Hello? Thank you. Thank you. All right. Tolya! Tolya, she allowed. Who? My mother allowed me to come to see Sasha tomorrow. Now listen to me carefully. She keeps telling that I've taken you away from her. If she tells this lie again, that I don't give you back to her, you should get up and say: I want to live with my granny. I'm better off with my granny - not with you. >> Will you say the right thing? Will you not betray your granny, who has given all her blood for you? I won't betray you. Oh dear... What is it on your head? A hat, mom. Do you call this thing a hat? It's just a saucepan. I have no other. Are you hungry? Just a little. This is your birthday present. Thank you. What do you want - some cottage cheese or beets salad? Beets salad. Better take cottage cheese. Your father will have beets salad when he comes back. OK, give me some cottage cheese. Why should I always give you? Go to the kitchen and eat. There're no servants to wait on you. You got used to your ass being wiped until you turned 15. You think I'll still wipe your ass when you're 40? I'm 36, mother. Don't make me older. Well, I don't even have to. In this hat you look 50 years old. Mom, you know, you smell different. - What do you mean 'different'? - Just a second. That's how you should smell. I simply changed perfume. - Are you in a fever? - I'll be fine soon. Galina Sergeyevna has applied glass-cups today. Thank you for the toy wagons - exactly what I dreamed of. Oh, don't mention it. Why are you crying? Because I'm happy to see you. Did you miss me? Yes. The cottage cheese is cold. I've just taken it out of the freezer. Wait till it gets warmer. What is that spot on your forehead? The suntan was peeling. Some pigment spots remained. It doesn't look like pigment spot. It's sure oncology. - Mother. - What? Will you please give me back my coat. I have nothing to wear. I borrowed a coat from my friend, but... Here's your coat, my dear daughter. What are you doing in front of a kid? - You're a hooligan! - It's all right. It's his granny's ass, not of some easy lay that swapped her child for a drunkard. What has this whore brought you? Granny, please don't! Don't! Give it to me, please! I've had enough! I can't take it any more! Sasha, get dressed! I'm taking him away! I'm taking him, you hear? Sasha, where're your things? Where's your coat? You won't live with this crazy old woman any more! You'll live with your mother! Do you want to go to your mom? Let go of him, bitch. You haven't raised him. You'll never get him! Get out of here! You've taken everything! All my things, my son! Now you want to take his love! I won't let you have him! He is my child! Say what you're supposed to! Tell her what you must tell, you traitor! He's my son! Stay where you are. Say your farewells. Mom, mom. What? Are you and Tolya going to divide granny's property today? What? Granny's money is hidden in the 4th, 10th and 16th volumes of Gorky. And more is in the old teapot and in the bags with rice.
