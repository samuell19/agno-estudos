(whirring) (triumphant music) - Then Captain Kickboxer disables the death ohm with a gut cruncher! (upbeat indie music) Captain Kickboxer sees his chance. A flying Dutchman kick to the neck! (shouts) - What is going on here? You're gonna be late for your first lesson. Oh, what a mess, Dad told you to clean up last night. Now don't step on the seats. - Clean your room, don't step on the seats. Nah, nah, nah, nah. (indie rock music) So what is this kickboxing teacher like? - (sighs) You'll be fine. - But what if I don't get it? - You'll get it. Then you can be a real kickboxer, like Captain Kickboxer. - If you say so. - Go get them, champ. - YOu're not coming with me? - I'm the king, I can't go back to the basics with squirts like you. You'll be fine. - Yeah, kickboxing rocks. - Don't let Master June kick your butt. (melancholy music) - Check out all the combat gear. - I know, it's pretty neat stuff, huh? - Oh, excuse me, do you know where Master June is? - June, place looks great. Really done a lot with it. - [June] Thanks. - Now about those private lessons. (phone rings) Ah, fudge. Sorry. Yeah? Yeah, I understand, I'll be right over. I gotta go. I'll see you tonight? - Tomorrow night? - Tonight. Tomorrow night, all right. See you. That was good. (thumping dance music) ♪ Yo baby, yo baby, yo baby ♪ ♪ Yo baby, yo baby, yo ♪ ♪ Getting hot, baby, hot, yo, boy ♪ ♪ Who's the man with an answer ♪ ♪ Baby, M.J. ♪ - What's up with this DJ, man? I was just starting to get into the music. - I don't know, Stan, I kinda like it. - What are you doing, butt wipe, those are my dad's records. - Chill, babe, I think Crillo makes this. - Put the records back. Get out of my face. - Hey dude, I think she digs me. - Looking for Danny? - No. - Yes you are. Hey, check it out. - Hey there. - Melinda. - Melinda, it's your lucky day today. I'm gonna let you go home with me tonight. - Me too. - Excuse me? - Don't wet yourself, sweetheart, you can come with us. (laughing) - They want us. (gentle music) - I don't know why I attend functions like those. - Me neither, the girls are always stuck up. - [Chet] Come on, let's pound these dorks. - [Treck] Yeah. (suspenseful music) - Hey look, guys, just like the nature channel! A beached whale! (laughs) (yelping) (grunting) (groans) (inspiring music) - When we were kicking butt, taking no names, let alone prisoners, back in combat, it was great. There was nothing quite like shooting down unarmed men with powerful submachine guns. (mimics gunfire) But enough about me. It would be very unrealistic of me to expect you yellow-bellied street gang rejects to live up to my example, so hit the mat and give me 20! - Sir, yes, sir! - I told you to call me Captain. - Yes, Captain, sir, yes, Captain, sir! - Hit the mats, piss ants! (grunting) - Hm, losers joining the competition. Chet, Treck, get your sad fannies over here. At ease. Take a look over there. - Hey, I know those two. - Yeah, we were gonna kick their butts, but somebody came out of nowhere, nailed me with a roundhouse. - A roundhouse, eh? Did you kick him in the nards? - Well, not exactly. - I told you, always take out their nards! - Yes, Captain! - I want you both to go over there and teach those spunk monkeys they're going to the wrong kickboxing school, capisce? - Ca-what, sir? - Nevermind, do what I said. (ominous music) - Gee, I don't know about this, Stan. - Relax, let's at least check it out. - [Barry] If you say so. - I think you girls are in the wrong place. I mean, the ballet school's right down the street. - Look, guys, we don't want any trouble. - You're gonna get a lot more than that, fat boy. (suspenseful music) - Hey guys, leave him alone. - Who's gonna make him, you, fat boy? - I think you two should leave. - What are you, their mother? - Oh, mother. - Oh, I can see you two aren't very bright, so I'm gonna let you walk out of here unscathed. Or are you two here to sign up for the beginner's class? (chuckling) - Beginner's class? - Beginner's class. (guffaws) - That one's to fan the air, next one's for real. - Captain says it's okay to beat up on girls, right? - Let's do it. (grunting) (groans) - [June] Consider that a free lesson, boys. - Tres magnifique. - Farfegnugen. - If you two care to sign up, I've got a two for one special. - Really, how much would that cost? - Shut up, Treck. You haven't seen the last of us. None of you have! (suspenseful music) - Those are some of the more advanced techniques you'll be learning later. Now let's start with the basics. (classic country music) - Purrs like my girlfriend. - Listen, kid, I'm paying you to change oil on other people's cars, not diddle with your own. - I'm a craftsman, not a diddler. Anyway, I gotta go pick up my babe from kickboxing class. I'm out of here. - So what's up with you and Brian? You pretty much ignored him at the party. - I don't know, I'm not sure what I wanna do right now. - [Melinda] Hang on a second, I have to get a towel for my hair. - You're taking a shower before kickboxing class? - You never know who you might meet. - You are such a tramp. - You got that, girlfriend. So do you want me to pick you up on my way to class? - No, Racer X is picking me up. - If you wanna let him down easy, why don't you just tell him he has to choose between you and the car? - Good idea. (horn honking) There he is. I gotta go, bye. - Okay, bye. - So babe, you're going with me to the car show Saturday night, aren't you? - I don't know, Brian. - What do you mean, you don't know? Of course you are. I'll pick you up at eight. (bell chimes) - Hey Danny. - Hey Cindy, how's it going? - She's doing great, aren't you, babe? - I'm fine, thanks for asking. So you're not coming to class anymore? - I really don't have the time. Besides, I was just doing it for the goofs. - You're pretty good for a goof. (melancholy music) (speaking foreign language) (shouting) - Hey, these guys are pretty good. - I bet I'll be doing this after one or two lessons. - Now remember, although you know the moves and progressions, you must be able to change and manipulate what you know to suit any situation. A reed that does not bend will break. We don't want any broken reeds in this class. Brian, come on up. - Uh oh. (mimicking chicken) - Not to worry. (tense music) - You know the techniques, but you're not flexible with them. You must have balance. Even if you don't have time to get into your stances, balance is key. - We could handle that, balance. - Balance my butt. - Step right up, boys! Get your very own genuine imitation of the real thing, Walkdude radios! Listen to all the bad tunes you love right in your very own ears! (foreboding music) Yo babe! Those boots were made for knocking. - Check it out! (thumping dance music) (shouts) - Whoa, I gotta calm down, dude. - [Tarbeck] Are you sure she's gonna be here? I think she likes me. - Yo, city honcho! Wanna buy a Walkdude? - Yeah, right. - How about you, comandante? - Degenerates. - I know I am, but what are you? - Watch it, punk. (shouting) Hello, June. How's the little daycare center these days? - What do you want, Tarbeck? - Just a friendly visit. You know, babe, you and me should get together for some social commingling. A little cerebral combat, if you will, a little horizontal kickboxing-- - Shut up, Tarbeck! June. I came to give notice personally. You're out of here at the end of the summer. - What do you mean, I'm out of here? What have you got to do with my lease? - I have controlling interest in the bank that holds the deed on your property. I'm gonna see to it that your lease is not renewed. - Of course, when I take over, I might need an assistant. - Over your dead body, Tarbeck. - You know, I've got an idea. I'm gonna give you a chance to win back your lease. Your students against his in a contest at the end of the summer, winner take all. - I thought you said-- - Winner take all. Tarbeck, if your kids can't beat the daylights out of this sorry bunch of losers, you deserve to stay in that strip mall. - I'm gonna enjoy this, Brian. With Danny gone, you're gonna be my little punching bag. - Oh I can handle you. - Don't worry, girls, it's gonna be quick and painless. - You mean like your love life? - See you later, class, get ready for pain. (ominous music) - Why are you giving them a chance? Why not just take away their lease? - What's the matter, Tarbeck, worried? - No, of course not. - A little humiliation is good before defeat. You saw that class, they're a bunch of losers, just like her. Work out the details, I'll have papers drawn up. It's good to settle old accounts. - Captain Tarbeck's Academy. Pain and cruelty. - Yeah. Bet you. - Those guys are such jerks. Who do they think they are anyway? - If those bozos want a fight, they got one. - Melinda, you dated that Treck guy once before, right? - No way. All right, maybe just once. - It's a good thing we're just beginners, huh, Barry? Looks like we won't have to fight. - Not so fast, you two. Beginners fight in competition, too. At least one of you will compete. - Am I interrupting? - No, Cindy, come on in. Can't even tell you how many students have been through here in the past 50 years. - That's Brian's dad, isn't it? - Yep. - How old were you when Master Hung adopted you? - A few months. He liked to think that he was teaching kids a lot more than martial arts. He'd say the ones that were taught to handle trouble were the ones that could avoid it. Now I've gone and landed this place in more trouble than he could have imagined. - How do you figure? - I've spent a lot of money, renovating, expanding the building. Took out a loan against the academy. (gentle music) - You think he'll come back and help? - Maybe. But we'll be ready to do this on our own. (indie rock music) - Here's my buy 10, get one free Miami Subs card, all filled out. - Yep, looks like you get a free fatty beef deluxe. Boy, he must've been hungry. - Let me see that. - What's up? - Do you know anybody named Mike Shortsaretight? - No. - Hugh Dickhead? Jaun Hunlow? - Doesn't ring any bells. - Gee, that's funny, 'cause they're the guys that signed this card for this free hamburger, you fat dip. - Well how was I supposed to know? - It's covered in the employee manual. This hamburger is coming out of your paycheck. - That's not fair. - Hey! If you don't like it, take it up with the regional supervisor. Now get back to work. - Hey, I know you, the beached whale. - You must have me confused with some other whale. - Oh no, you're the douche. Chet tells me you've joined the competition. - Oh, you mean the kickboxing academy. Yeah, I was just there checking it out. Didn't like it, it sucked. - And don't you forget it. Now, get me a double bacon cheese fatty, you fatty! ♪ Won't waste my time shifting foreign gears ♪ (indie rock music) - All right, 12's unstuck now. (growls) Told you to wait 'till I was out of the lane, you little jerk! I could deal with customer service if the customers weren't all such pigs. - Rough night? - All I know is this is my last summer working here for my dad. Then he coughs up for a new sports car, and it's guy city. (chuckles) Hey! It only takes tokens. Tokens. Spay and neuter your pets, that's all I have to say. - You're mean. - Let's go to my car, I need to get league posters. (foreboding music) - Hey. (whistling) - Ooh, a man who can whistle. Pinch me, I must be dreaming. - Pinch you, baby. - It's okay, I was only kidding. - Ooh, how can you resist? - Come on, he's even wearing cologne! - Stop right there, I mean it. - We're so scared. (suspenseful music) (grunting) - Ow, my ass. These girls are wicked. Ow, my ass. - I'm out of here! - Go ahead, Jean Claude. - Thanks, Danny. - It looks like you had the situation under control, I was just finishing them off. - You were just goofing, right? - Yeah, goofing. - Did you hear about the big match we have against Tarbeck's class at the end of the summer? - The way you handled those guys, it doesn't look like you'll have too much trouble. - You know, we could use your help. - Yeah, well you'll be all right. I'm gonna go back inside, all right? I'll see you later. - Thanks, Danny. - Yeah, thanks. (phone rings) - Fatal Combat, this is Tarbeck. - [Max] Yeah, is Bill there? - Bill who? - [Max] Bill your mother for last night. (cackles) Later. - Mommy? Punk kids. (triumphant music) - Aw yeah, there it is, the king daddy thrash. Aw yeah, I will have it. - If you win the world thrash board championship, you could afford it. - I know, that's why I got my new job as a messenger. The tournament charges a hefty wad to get in, dude. - Broken down, man. - Yeah. (upbeat music) (ominous music) - Hey Jason, nice skateboard. - Thanks. - Give me that! - You wanna read my Captain Kickboxing comic? - No, I wanna tear it in half, then steal your skateboard. (tense music) I'm gonna get you, punk! Now I'm pissed off! (gentle music) - Hiya. - That's not how I taught you to keeya. You can do better than that. - Maybe I don't want to. - Why not? Should always wanna do your best. - I'm not so sure about this kickboxing thing anyway. - Now what does that mean? - Well this kid just jumped me, and there was nothing I could do about it. Then he stole my comic book. - Oh he did, did he? Well I might have to take some serious action. I may have to teach you some of my secret moves. - Really? - Really. But you gotta promise me one thing, okay? - Okay, anything, what? - I need you to compete for the school in the junior lightweight division at the end of the summer. - Okay, but you better teach me those moves pretty darn quick. - Okay. (coughs) What are you two doing here? You here to practice? Well your next class isn't until tomorrow. - Well actually, after some serious soul searching, some self-actualization through hypnosis and meditation, tell her, Barry. - As Stan was saying-- - You're quitting. - Yeah, we're quitting. - Yeah, we're quitting. - I was counting on one of you to compete in the beginner's division against Fatal Combat. - Well Master June, my, my... Tell her, Barry. - His hemorrhoids have been flaring up and he can't compete. - Fine, then I guess it's up to you, Barry. Well, to be honest with you, Master June, I don't think I could be ready in time. Plus me and Stan are kind of a one-two combo. - I see, so-- - If you're both quitters, we don't need you here anyway. - Hey, you be quiet, kid. - Barry, let's get out of here. - That was kinda mean, what I said, wasn't it? - What do you think? - Den mother, psychiatrist, and kickboxing instructor all rolled into one. - Comes with the territory. - There's gotta be an easier way to earn a living. - Oh I'm sure there's an easier way, but there's no other way for me. (upbeat rock music) (grunts) - Work on that, or you'll be scrubbing the latrines. (groaning) - How am I doing, Captain Tarbeck? - Good, Treck. - Have you secured the enemy's head? - Yes, Captain! - Do you remember what to do next? - Elbow to the ribs! (grunts) What next? - Sucker punch. (shouts) Good work, Chet! You're really getting the hang of this. - Thank you, Captain. - You know, you'll be representing the Fatal Combat School in the black belt contest against those Kickboxing Academy wussies. - All right! - You will be fighting Brian. Maybe one of those Kickboxing Academy chicks. See who the real men are! They'll be yours for the taking. (shouts) (phone rings) Fatal Combat, Tarbeck coming at you. - [Maddox] How are your students doing? - Well, great, Mr. Maddox. - I just wanted you to know that if your main guy isn't up to it, I have access to a secret weapon. - I'm sure there'll be no need for that, I trained all my boys personally. - Yeah, that's what I'm worried about. Just keep in mind what I said. (foreboding music) - [Cindy] This is Cindy, I'm not home right now. Just leave me a message, and I'll call you back as soon as I can. Bye. - Ow! - [Stabile] What has got into you, Brian? - Nothing, just hurt my thumb. - Something on your mind today? - I'm fine! - Just seemed like something was eating on you, that's all. None of my business. - It's nothing. It's just that I had this date with Cindy to go to the car show, and now I can't get her on the phone. - I didn't know Cindy even liked cars that much. - Are you kidding, she's nuts about them. - Pedro took a message for you about two hours ago. I think it was Cindy. - What? Damn, why didn't she tell me this yesterday when I asked her? - I'm gonna go to the show with a couple of my car club buddies if you'd like to tag along. - Thanks, but you're supposed to go to these things with your babe. - Life's rough, kid. - [June] It's a nice place. - What? Oh yeah. It's just a meager attempt to impress you. Sounded like you had a tough week, I thought maybe a night out relaxing might do the trick. Hm? - Is everything all right? - No, the wine. I don't know, it's a little off. Do me a favor, sport, will you? Bring me another bottle, same year. - Yes, sir. - Please. Trust me. - Okay, awkward pause. - Well I wanted to tell you something. June, when I'm with you, everything seems to just fade away. Just deals and clients and contracts, all that stuff. It's not important, gone. Don't laugh, don't laugh. I'm not kidding. When I'm with you, it's like we're alone on a deserted island, just you and me. (phone rings) Somebody's. Sorry, I thought I... I'm sure I left it in the car, but I didn't. Excuse me. Yeah? I know, okay, bye. Have I mentioned recently how beautiful your eyes are? - [Man] Party on, dude, cool. - You know, I heard the first time you do it, it should be with someone who knows what they're doing. - That makes sense. But I think you should be with somebody that you really love. That really loves you. - Whatever. (giggles) - I wanna know more about your dad. What'd he do next? - When his boss at the button factory went home for the day, he'd hold kickboxing lessons in his office. It's how he saved up for the academy. - Mm. You know what, I've had a wonderful time tonight with you. - Well next time, you should get a table for three. - Three? - Me, you, and your friend the telephone. - Sorry, I... Wait a minute, you did say next time, right? - Yes. - Good. Good, you won't regret it. (suspenseful music) - Hey! - Hey! (grunting) (shouts) (groaning) - Get outta here. Get outta here! Amateurs. - What was that all about? - I have no idea. Friends of yours? - No, are you okay? - Yeah, nothing like getting kicked on a full stomach. - Yeah, well next time we get attacked, remember, I'm the kickboxing instructor, you're the lawyer. - Be my guest. You fight, I'll sue for damages. How much you think I could get for a broken ego? (gentle music) - Danny? Danny, is that you? - Oh. Hi, Cindy. - What the hell are you doing out here? - Until you showed up, I was sleeping. - Danny, you're sleeping on the dirt out by the beach. - It was the only place I could think of, given the circumstances. - Trouble with your dad? - You'd think a 52 year old man would conk out after a case of beer. I hope I have the energy to throw a coffee table through a wall when I'm his age. - You could've called me. - Maybe last year. Anyways, I thought you lost interest. - What do you expect? The way you took off after, after the accident during the kickboxing competition. - Accident? I nearly killed that guy. - It was an accident. Besides, I didn't hear from you for months. What was I supposed to do? - It doesn't matter anyways. I don't fight anymore and you're seeing someone else. - I'm not too sure about that. Brian and I, he's a nice guy and everything. - Do you remember that time that we stayed up all night talking on your roof, and I almost fell off, and your dad heard us? - I remember, he called the cops. - Yeah. Does that seem like a long time ago to you or what? - Yeah, and no. - Cindy. - What? - I don't know, it's you and me, and it's been a long time. - Shut up. Kiss me. (whirring) (phone rings) - Damn falling products. Tarbeck here. - [Max] Hi, is Al there? - Al? - [Max] Yeah, I'll kick your big old butt if you don't stop crapping on my lawn. (whirring) - Hey, you brought my new skateboard. (tense music) (clucking) If I catch you, you're dead! - Are you okay, Jason? - Oh, hi, Master June. Just doing some training exercises. - Oh, well I don't even know those moves. You'll have to show me sometime. (ominous music) - I can't believe it! - Aw man, those jerks are gonna pay. - We can't be sure who did this. - No offense, but we all know who did this. I mean, come on. - What are we gonna do now? Our tournament with those pigs is less than a month away. - I say we go down there and give them a taste of their own medicine. - They'll be ready for it. I bet they're even counting on it. - I guess that's it, then. - That's what? - If you mean quit, no way. Even if we have to practice at the beach. (upbeat rock music) ♪ I got a girl ♪ ♪ Her name is Sue ♪ - Master June, under the circumstances and the marginal propensity that does succeed to exist, assuming no physical liability, I would say Barry and I would think there would be no better time than the present to re-engage in some... Tell her, Barry. - Doctor said the best thing for hemorrhoids is kickboxing. - So you wanna be let back in class, huh? Usually don't take back quitters. - We didn't so much quit as we did-- - According to the medical situation, which was bordering on critical, if you know what I mean, and I think you do. - Don't make any presumptions. - We mean we quit, and we're sorry. - And we wanna know if we can get back into the class. (mellow rock music) - I just remembered how much I hated playing pool with you. - Yeah, I guess the old maestro could still teach you a few things, huh? - You never know, Danny. Maybe I can teach you a few new things now, too. - Are we talking about pool? - Pool, life. You oughta come down to the beach and watch us work out sometime. - What, Baywatch meets Enter the Dragon? - I'm talking about kickboxing. - Kickboxing, life. Hey, I wouldn't mind help fixing up the academy. - We're doing fine without you, Danny. (foreboding music) Hey Cind, haven't been able to reach you on the phone lately, and I can't get more than two words out of you in class, and here you are. - Brian, are you drunk? - Whoa, cute, smart, and psychic. - I try to talk with you, Brian, you just never listen. - I never listen? I never listen? Who's the one who fixed your carburetor after you described the funny noise it was making? - Brian-- - You were stranded on I-95. You called me up in tears, and your exact words were, "Caboodly plank, ka-per, ka-plank." - Brian-- - And I knew, why? Because I listened. - Brian, will you shut up and let me talk? This is just what I mean, I can't finish a sentence with you. It's always we're going here, we're going there. You never stop and find out who I really am. - Oh, and I guess Mr. run away from everything James Dean of the pool hall does. - Yeah, he does. Brian, you're a nice guy and everything, I just think that-- - I know what you're trying to do. You think you can just come back and everything will be the same. Just go back to your boozer dad. The Kickboxing Academy doesn't need you, and my girlfriend doesn't need you. - Cindy's right, you don't listen. - Brian, maybe we should just talk later. - No way I'm leaving you here with him. - Maybe we should just leave. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - She's not leaving with you, loser. - I don't wanna fight you, Brian. - I know you think you're a bad boy, but I'm no punk like that kid you hurt in the competition. - I'll see you later, man. (suspenseful music) (grunting) (indie rock music) (upbeat country music) (punchy pop music) - Brian, are you okay? - Who needs you? Who needs anyone? (foreboding music) - Hey Brian. Is boozing it up part of the academy's program now? Ew. - I guess barfing on your car is part of the program, too, Brian. - Does the term projectile vomiting mean anything to you guys? (foreboding music) (upbeat pop music) - I could tell you a story, would make your skin crawl. (gentle piano music) But I won't. Actually, this bottle come a long way. And it belonged to somebody who's no longer with us, but that's neither here nor there. What's important is us. We're here. 64, great year. To new beginnings. Toast? - New beginnings. (phone rings) - [Maddox] Carl, have you got the paperwork ready? I'm gonna see to it that full ownership of the Kickboxing Academy-- - What? Jerk. (upbeat pop music) (ominous music) (tires screeching) (banging) (solemn music) - All right, class, let's take a breather. I have an announcement to make. Brian's not gonna be competing in the tournament against Fatal Combat. Pierre's gonna be taking his place in the black belt round. - But I just moved up to black belt last month. - I wouldn't let you compete if I didn't believe you could do it. - Gee, Cindy, what happened between you and Brian? - I told you already, I had to talk to him sometime. I just didn't know he'd get drunk. - You really know how to drive your men over the edge. - That's not funny. - I was just kidding. - When did Brian talk to you? - Actually, his parents called me. You haven't heard? - Heard what? - Brian was in a car accident last night. He's hurt, he's in the hospital. (somber music) - Captain Kickboxer backs away from Deathwarden's giant mechanical menace. The robot's visor emits a potent death ray. - Hey bro, could you leave us alone for a couple minutes? - Sure. If you wanna read this, here you go. You better be nice to him, otherwise you'll have to answer to me. - Listen, Brian. I just wanted to say that I am so-- - It's all right, Cindy. It's not your fault. (gentle music) I've had some time off lately, and I've been doing some thinking. - Brian-- - And I just wanna say that maybe I haven't been listening to you, and taking you into consideration like I probably should've. Stabile at the garage is always asking me why I spend so much time there. Told you to keep out, you little creep! Anyway, when I had such a beautiful girlfriend, I guess I know why he wondered. What I'm trying to say, no hard feelings? - Thanks, Brian. - I'm not sure I can get used to seeing you with what's-his-name. - He's not so bad once you get to know him. - So who's taking my place in the tournament? - Pierre. - Pierre? He's a nice guy, but he's not me, if you know what I mean. - Well right now, Pierre's all we got. - So do you really think that showing us slides of your combat days are gonna help us against the Kickboxing Academy tomorrow? - Chet, sucker punch. (shouts) I wouldn't have shown them to you if I didn't think they would help, now would I? Yes, Soupy? - I don't understand. - Soupy, sucker punch yourself. (shouts) (phone rings) Fatal Combat, Tarbeck here. - Are you ready for tomorrow? - We've been ready for weeks, and we've seen to it that their main combatant will be watching from the sidelines. - Get ready for another roster change. - [Tarbeck] You want us to take out someone else? - You're replacing Chet with another fighter. - But you, we can't do that! - You can and we will. I have a secret weapon. - It's just that we can handle this by ourselves, Mr. Maddox. - Tarbeck, you couldn't handle toilet paper by yourself. It's a done deal, bye. (dial tone beeps) (ominous music) - He doesn't know who he's dealing with. (laughing) - [Thug] Check it out, Captain Tarbeck's getting a wedgie. (foreboding music) - Danny. What a pleasant surprise. - Yeah, well Cindy told me about this place getting trashed, and I thought I'd stop by, see if I could help out or anything. - The only thing we need help with is the competition against Fatal Combat. - I can't really help you there. You know as good as anybody, I can't fight anymore. I almost killed somebody. - Danny, I'm gonna tell you a secret, something none of my other students know, but I think it can help you. - Well shoot. - I was nine years old when I first competed. Studying under my father, I was especially anxious to please him. My opponent, a nine-year-old little boy, died right in front of me. I swore I'd never compete again. Week later we found out it was congenital heart failure, nothing to do with the competition. I still wouldn't fight. Then my father taught me the most important lesson of my life. - What was that? - You have to put the past behind you or it blocks your way. Your opponent recovered fully. It's time you do the same. (uplifting music) - I have to say, I underestimated Brian. For once, he seemed to understand, or at least try to. - Well that's good, no sour grapes. - Yeah, so sour grapes. Whatever that's supposed to mean. Brian wants you to take his place in the tournament tomorrow. He thinks you're the only chance we've got, and so do I. - What, are you guys ganging up on me? Pierre has it under control. - You're better than him and you know it. He knows it. - I'm just not a kickboxer. - Well then just do it for goofs. Or do it for me. (serene music) (inspiring music) - The king has arrived. So, do you come around here often? (mellow lounge music) (sniffing) Whoa, dude, why don't you just shoot us next time? - I didn't do it. - Yeah, right. This fine, bodacious babe certainly isn't guilty. (dinging) Whoa, I have got to lay off those nachos. (chatting) Hey dude. - You ever heard the words excuse me? - No. - No? Pay attention. - All right. - Address is on the outside, all right? You make copies, and you file the originals. Get out of here, man. Where were we? Oh yeah, come in here. (whimsical music) - Oh check this out. Transfer of ownership. I better talk the guy from the academy about this. But it's too far. I'll never make my skateboarding tournament. All right, all right. Major decision time. Do I become world thrash board champ, or do I help my friends? - Ladies and gentlemen, before we get started, please welcome an exhibition by the Okinawan Shuri-ryu sensation, Armando the noodle Ramos. (cheering) (suspenseful music) - What's in the bag? - Rub down oil, extra briefs, ginseng tablets, computer baseball. Oh, and three tuna sandwiches. Want one? (applauding) - Looking forward to joining the ranks of the unemployed? - In my office last night I saw an old tournament photo. Reminded me of how sad my father was when a young man died at the academy at the start of a match. A match against me. - I don't need to hear this. - It was congenital heart failure. I've never forgotten, and I know you haven't. But hurting me and hurting my students isn't gonna bring your son back, Mr. Maddox. - I meant what I said before, June. When I take over your school, there'll always be a position for you under me. (bell rings) - Welcome to Bayside, where two longtime rivals are here to meet once again. The School of Fatal Combat and the Kickboxing Academy. There will be four matches. - So do you think he's gonna show? - I hope so, he didn't say. - We'll be fine without him, right, Pierre? - Yeah, fine, I hope. - But before we get on with the competition, allow me to introduce you to the sponsor of the competition, Mr. Charles Maddox. (applauding) And now for the junior competition. Competing for Fatal Combat, coached by Reeve Tarbeck, is Jam Winowski. (applauding) Competing for the Kickboxing Academy, coached by June Hung, is Jason McMurphy. - Remember the secret moves. - And remember, a cheap shot is better than a rabies shot. - Yeah, Coach, got you covered. (bell rings) (speaks foreign language) (suspenseful music) - Kick! - Right, sucker punch! (cheering) - Point! - One point, Winowski. (grunting) (cheering) - Point! - One point, McMurphy. - Don't got nothing. (grunting) Yo, Jason! (cheering) - Point! (bell rings) - All right, all right, all right! - [Announcer] Point and match, Jan Winowski, Fatal Combat. - Yay, I won, yeah! - Yay, you're just lucky your coach helped you from the sidelines! Now sit down, get outta here. - All right! (whooping) - Are you okay? - He cheated. - I know they cheated, but I'm very proud of you. (bell rings) - Next up, the beginner's division. For the Kickboxing Academy, Stan Slovski. (applauding) - Hey, Slovski! Why don't we put you in a round room and tell you there's a cheese danish in the corner? (guffaws) (chattering) - Representing Fatal Combat, Marion Gitler. - Marion Gitler? We don't have any chicks on our team. - That's you, cabana boy. - Oh, oh, oh yeah. - Come a long way, Stan, I know you can do it. - Wish I was going with you, buddy. - What a dork. - He's no beginner. He is no beginner, I've seen him practicing with Tarbeck before. - [Judge] He has all the appropriate paperwork. Mr. Maddox has cleared him personally. (bell rings) - And this time, I'm gonna beat your fat whale butt for good! (speaks foreign language) (grunts) - Yes! (cheering) - [Announcer] Point, Gitler. (laughs) (foreboding music) (jeering) - Come on, son. In the nards, nards. Go for the nards. (grunting) - Oh, you suck! - Point! - Go Stan! - Point, Slovski. - Hang on, Soupy! Hang on! - Yeah, all right! - Beached whale my butt. (speaks foreign language) - Go get him! (cackling) (grunting) - [Referee] Point! (cheering) - Whoa. (bell rings) - Yeah! - I didn't know he could do that. - Point and match, Stan Slovski, Kickboxing Academy. - Damn it, Gitler, you suck! You got beat by a fatty beef burger. - Shut up. - What did you say? - Nothing. - And now for the cat fight. Just a little joke. The woman's competition. For the Kickboxing Academy, Melinda Becker, and for Fatal Combat, Treck Abbott. Tarbeck, Treck's a guy. - Equal rights, check the rules. - It's okay, Melinda, you can take him. - Go get him, Melinda! - If I can do it, you can. (speaks foreign language) (grunting) - [Tarbeck] Treck, kick her in the nards! (jeering) - Go, Treck, all right! - Get around, take your time. - Hook kick! - Sucker punch! (applause) (ominous music) - Ow! Damn chick kicked me in the balls. - No point, no point. (bell rings) - Point and match, Abbott, illegal blow below the belt. - Excuse me? (cheering) - We still got the black belt competition. - I kicked your butt and you know it. - Cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat cheat! (cheering) - I won. - He did. - But I cheated. - If we lose, we know it's because they cheated. - Losing doesn't save the academy, Pierre. - Get ready for the black belt competition. Fatal Combat and the Kickboxing Academy present their finest competitors in what could be the deciding match. (applauding) For the Kickboxing Academy, Pierre Bersuire. (cheering) Representing Fatal Combat, John Hammer. (ominous music) - Chet was supposed to fight in the black belt competition. Who's this clown? - [Judge] He's a replacement. Says here Chet dislocated his shoulder. - Yeah, but the replacement needs to be from Fatal Combat. I can only guess where they found Hulk Hogan over there. I know, don't say it, they have all the appropriate paperwork. - What did they say? - Pierre, you're next. (serene music) - Look, it's Danny. - It's too late, we can't replace Pierre unless he's-- (groans) Injured. Pierre Bersuire is injured, we need to make a substitution. Danny Sheridan is the replacement. - What the hell is going on here? - [Judge] Pierre Bersuire is being replaced by Danny Sheridan. - Danny Sher, why he, you can't do that. - [Judge] It's done. - What's the matter, afraid of a fair fight? - Go ahead, it's his funeral. (bell rings) - There has been a substitution. Danny Sheridan will be fighting for Pierre Bersuire. (cheering) - Three point system, one point deducted for fouls. Let's have a clean fight. - You're going home in a stretcher, little man. - Let's rumble. (suspenseful music) (grunting) - Danny! - Oh, excellent cheap shot. - Yeah, I'm gonna get you. - Point, Hammer. - Why are we always the ones to get hit first? - What do you think, Danny? - He's quicker and bigger and stronger than me. Other than that, I think I can take him. - Good, go do it. (uplifting music) (speaks foreign language) (suspenseful music) (grunting) (cheering) - [Announcer] Point, Sheridan. (jeering) - I'm number one. - [Announcer] Point, Hammer. (clamoring) (cheering) (growls) - Point! - [Announcer] Point, Sheridan. - Yes, good kick. - Aw, that's not a good cheap shot. (speaks foreign language) (grunting) (triumphant music) (cheering) (bell rings) - Point and match, Danny Sheridan, the Kickboxing Academy. - That sucks. - The tournament now stands at a tie. The judges have informed me that in a contest of this sort, a tie is broken through competition by the instructors. Will Masters Hung and Tarbeck please approach the mat? - Just what the hell are you trying to pull? - [Judge] It's in the rules, check the rules. - I'm sorry, but I can't fight. Reasons I can't discuss, I just can't fight. - You have to put the past behind you or it blocks your way. You can't deny who you are, you're a kickboxer. - Yeah, so get out there and kick some butt. - Yeah, go kick his butt. - Absolutely, make him wish I was never born. - If you don't fight, we can't win. - Excellent, Captain, I've always wanted to see you sucker punch a chick. - Heck yeah! - Yeah, show us how it's done! - Take her down. - Yeah, cheat and stuff. (chuckles) (foreboding music) - Say June, maybe we can work something out here. - Not likely, Tarbeck. - Come on, sucker punch her. (clamoring) - Yeah! (grunts) Go bad boy! (speaks foreign language) (grunts) (cheering) - Come on, Captain! - Point, Kickboxing Academy. - Point! (coughs) - Come on, come on! Captain, come on! (clamoring) - Sucker punch! - Kick her again. - Come on! - Yeah! - Come on, yeah! (cheering) - [Announcer] Point, Kickboxing Academy. Remember, first three points takes the tournament. (suspenseful music) - It kinda looks like she's kicking your butt, sir! - I'm just baiting her. - Hey Tarbeck, your fly's open! - Don't even think about it, kid, I wrote that gag. - Well if your fly isn't open, what the heck is that thing? - Eating it. (grunting) (bell rings) - Point and match, Kickboxing Academy! (cheering) - Come on, Captain! - Captain! - Well June, you won fair and square. I'm not going to be a sore loser, so I offer my congratulations. - Does this mean I'm keeping my academy? - And that I'll be lining up some corporate sponsorships for you. It's time for all of us to put the past behind us. - Thank you, sir, and I am sorry about your son. - I know. Well, a new beginning. - A new beginning. - Sir, I wouldn't be so quick jumping into verbal contracts with someone who, up until five minutes ago, we were strategizing against. - Master June, I got something you gotta see. - Beat it. - Please, Max, I'm busy. - Now Carl, have you got the paperwork ready? June is retaining full ownership of the Kickboxing Academy, all debts paid. - I don't think so, sir, it's no longer yours to give. - What are you talking about? - The Kickboxing Academy is in my name. I plan on razing the entire block and putting up an office building. - How can you do that? - Simple, I have his power of attorney, love cheeks. I can sign his name to just about anything. - And he's giving Fatal Combat, soon to be Tarbeck's Army Surplus Emporium, to me. - I'll take you to court. I'll get you disbarred. - Okay, expect a decision by the 22nd century, maybe. - Not quite, dude. Master June, check it out. - [June] Wait a second. - I'm surprised at myself. - It's okay, sir, we all have to lose sometimes. - I'm a little surprised I had someone as stupid as you in my employ. This young man has just handed me the original documents in which you gave yourself ownership of the academy. - What? You idiot, what did you do? You were supposed to file the originals and make copies. - Whoops, I guess I messed up accidentally on purpose. - Hey, what's this? - Oh, that's a xerox of my butt. - Great, I'm ruined. - More than that, you're going to jail. - AKA the slammer, if you know what I mean, and I think you do. (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (screaming) - Everybody freeze! - But you said freeze, sir. - Not you nimrods, you're my troops, my backup, my battalion. - Sir, we lost a kickboxing match. Don't you think creating a hostage situation is a bit severe? - Yeah, sir, my mom's supposed to pick me up out front in like 15 minutes. - Nevermind that! Treck, check the exits. - Maybe we should think about this, sir. - Sir, we won't tell anybody that a chick kicked your butt. - It's over, Reeve, don't make matters worse. - No, no! It's not over! Carl promised me! He promised I'd get to open up my Army Navy store if I helped him! I can't spend the rest the rest of my life teaching worthless teenagers anymore! - Captain Tarbeck! - Shut up. I know you all laughed at me. You always laughed at me. You all have. Who's laughing now? (laughs) It's my turn to shine now. You all had everything, but not anymore. Not anymore. (cheering) - Yes! (triumphant music) - Well, we did it, gang. I think this one's for the record books. - McMahon, I wanna thank you for what you did today. I feel I owe you a debt of gratitude. - No problem, MC numero uno. Hey, Tarbeck! Let me know what you're phone number's gonna be in jail, all right? - What for? - Gotta stay on top of my prank phone call skills. - What? (laughing) Why I oughta! Let me at him! - See you later, all right, all right, yeah. (upbeat music) - Tell her, Barry. - It was kind of an ancient mushu gaipan secret. - Ooh, did you get hurt? - Nope, but they sure did. - You used my secret moves. - Thanks for the pointers, Jason. - So no more trouble with Fatal Combat. - And no more lawyer boyfriends. - You can keep the academy as long as you like. The appropriate papers are being delivered to you tomorrow morning by me. - Really? - The inevitable comes to pass. I am now working for the el jefe grande, Councilman Maddox. And with my raise came the prompt acquisition of the skateboard of my dreams, the king daddy thrash. - Yeah, so let's party. - Listen, rugrat, you gotta be home by 10, so we're out of here. - Brian, I'll keep you company on the ride. - [Brian] Sure. - So Cindy, where's Danny? - I'm not positive, but I do have an idea. (uplifting music) - What took you so long? - I thought you'd come by the party. - No you didn't.
