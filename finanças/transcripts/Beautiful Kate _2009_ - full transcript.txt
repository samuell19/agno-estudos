AT LEAST ONE OF MY SONS IS PREPARED TO PUT A BIT OF HARD WORK IN ON THE FARM. WHAT? I SAID I'LL QUIT THE ROADHOUSE, AND I WILL. SURE YOU WILL, AFTER FRETTIN' AND FUSSIN' ABOUT IT LIKE SOME PATHETIC OLD WOMAN. I DON'T CARE WHAT TIME YOU FINISH. I WANT YOU BACK INSIDE THESE DOORS BY 12:00! [ DOOR CLOSES ] SIT DOWN!

I WOULDN'T MISS YOU. NOT FOR A BIT. I WANT SALT. YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY. COME ON, BRUCE. PLEASE, JUST EAT SOMETHING. JUST A LITTLE BIT. There you go. There you go. That's good. That's good. THANK YOU. [ LAUGHS ] OKAY. [ CHUCKLES ] ALL RIGHT. WELL, WE'LL, UH... TRY A BIT OF JUICE, THEN, SHALL WE? [ CLEARS THROAT ] COME ON. BRUCE, YOU'VE GOT TO GET SOMETHING INTO YOU. JUST DRINK. [ GRUNTS ] [ LAUGHS ] WHERE'S CLIFF? [ BURPS ] HE GOT HOME FROM THE ROADHOUSE 10 MINUTES LATE, AND THE BASTARD GROUNDED HIM. I BROUGHT YOUR STUPID POSTS. [ INDISTINCT SINGING ON RADIO ] THANKS.

WELL, YOU NEEDN'T BE FRIGHTENED. CLIFF WILL BE THERE. HE'LL PROTECT WIDDLE NEDDY. GEEZ, KATE, HOW CAN YOU JOKE ABOUT IT? GOD, SOMETIMES I THINK YOU'RE FROM OUTER SPACE. WELL, I GUESS I THOUGHT YOU WERE DIFFERENT FROM THE HERD, NED. NOT SO FUCKIN' TIMID! [ SHEEP BLEATING ] [ VEHICLE DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ] [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] [ ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ] DON'T BOTHER COMING BACK! YOU WON'T BE MISSED! Young Sally: AREN'T YOU GOING TO THE CHRISTMAS PARTY? NOPE. GOOD. WE'LL HAVE OUR OWN PARTY. YOU CAN PLAY RUDOLPH. * JINGLE BELLS * JINGLE BELLS, JINGLE ALL THE WAY * OH, WHAT FUN... CLIFF WANTS TO SEE YOU. WHY? HOLD THESE FOR RUDOLPH. THERE WE GO. [ SHEEP BLEATING ] HE'S WAITING IN THERE FOR YOU. YOU TOLD HIM? HE SAID HE'S WAITING FOR YOU. WHY? WHY DID YOU TELL HIM? I'M ASKING YOU WHY! YEAH, WHAT? KATE TOLD ME WHAT YOU TRIED, NED. WHAT? THAT YOU TRIED TO COP A FEEL. [ SCOFFS ] HEY, JESUS, NED. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU, MATE? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT, HUH? HUH? COME ON. HIT ME. HIT ME. COME ON. HEY, IT'S ALL RIGHT, MATE.

OH, YES, THE MAGNUM OPUS. NO, MORE OF A RECORD. A RECORD OF WHAT? FINISHED? I CAN IMAGINE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT ME. BUZZ IF YOU NEED ME. [ PAGER BEEPING ] [ SIGHS ] [ LABORED BREATHING ] [ SIGHS DEEPLY ] [ BIRDS CHIRPING ] ALL RIGHT. HERE? I'LL TELL YOU WHEN. HERE. 'ROUND A BIT. I KNOW YOU CHILDREN NEVER CARED FOR ME, ESPECIALLY YOU AND KATE. YOU'RE WRONG, BRUCE. LIKE THAT -- CALLING ME "BRUCE." YOU NEVER CALLED YOUR MOTHER "EMILY," DID YOU? [ COUGHING ] YOU'RE MAKING IT WORSE, BRUCE. WHEN YOUR MOTHER DIED... I WANTED TO FILL HER PLACE... GET CLOSE TO YOU LIKE SHE DID. BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW. [ SIGHS ] I THOUGHT MY WORLD WOULD BE IN POLITICS, BUT THAT DIDN'T PAN OUT. WHAT COULD I DO? TEACH? NOT YOUR FATHER. TOO PROUD. YOU KNOW WHAT, BRUCE? I DON'T THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY'VE LIVED SUCCESSFUL LIVES. I KNOW YOU BLAME ME FOR CLIFF'S SUICIDE. I THOUGHT I WAS HELPING HIM. I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE A TOUGHER WORLD FOR CLIFF THAN IT WAS FOR YOU AND KATE. [ SCOFFS ] I'M DONE. COME ON. LET'S GET BACK TO YOUR RECORD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] Man: THANK YOU. AND HERE'S ONE FOR THE LADIES. [ "ALWAYS ON MY MIND" PLAYS ] * MAYBE I DIDN'T LOVE YOU * QUITE AS OFTEN AS I COULD HAVE * MAYBE I DIDN'T TREAT YOU * QUITE AS GOOD AS I SHOULD HAVE * IF I MADE YOU FEEL SECOND BEST * GIRL, I'M SORRY I WAS BLIND * YOU WERE ALWAYS ON MY MIND * YOU WERE ALWAYS ON MY MIND... Man: SORRY. I DON'T WANT TO STAY HERE ANYMORE. I WANT TO LEAVE. WILL YOU TAKE ME? I'M NOT READY TO GO HOME YET, KATE. I DIDN'T SAY "HOME." - WHAT? I DIDN'T SAY "HOME." THE ANSWER'S NO, KATE. YOU HAVE TO! BRUCE SAID YOU HAD TO LOOK AFTER ME. WELL, CAN YOU JUST TAKE ME HOME, THEN? COME ON. LET'S GO. WILL SHE BE ALL RIGHT? SURE. CLIFF WILL LOOK AFTER HER. I'M LOOKING AFTER YOU. * I JUST NEVER TOOK THE TIME * YOU WERE ALWAYS ON MY MIND * YOU WERE ALWAYS ON MY MIND * TELL ME... COME ON, LET'S GO. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] MM! MM! OHH! OHH! HAPPY NOW, NEDDY? * DON'T NEED LOTS OF PEOPLE * TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO * DON'T NEED LONG-HAIRED LADIES * TO LOVE ME TRUE AS TRUE * ALL I NEED IS A ROCK-'N'-ROLL BAND * SOMEWHERE TO PLAY * AND I'M ON MY WAY * I'M ON MY WAY * I'M A ROCK-'N'-ROLL OUTLAW * AND I'M ON THE RUN * I'M A ROCK-'N'-ROLL OUTLAW * I NEVER NEEDED ANYONE [ MUSIC STOPS ] [ PARKING BRAKE ENGAGES ] CLIFF? HEY, CLIFF? Oh, God. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] OHH. OH, KATE. CLIFF!! Oh, God. CLIFF!! [ BARKING ] CLIFF! CLIFF!! [ VEHICLE APPROACHES ] [ HORN HONKS ] [ BITSIE BARKING ] [ BITSIE WHIMPERING ] BITSIE. HERE, LET ME TAKE THAT. TRIP OKAY? OH, THANKS. YEAH. NO, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD. SO, DID YOU KILL HIM YET? ALMOST. - HMM? [ DOOR OPENS ] HARDLY TOUCHED A THING. HOW DID HE EAT FOR YOU? OH, NOT MUCH. HE LOVES HIS CUSTARD. MAYBE I'LL GET SOME OF THIS INTO HIM, EH? SURE. DID YOU GET WHAT YOU WANTED, NED? YEAH. GOT SOME BOOKS. [ CLEARS THROAT ] [ CHUCKLES ] OH, GOOD. GOOD. I'M GLAD YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED. SORRY ABOUT TONI. LIAR. HEY, SAL? SAL... - HMM? HERE. LET ME TAKE IT IN TO HIM. I'M GOING IN THE MORNING. I'LL SAY GOODBYE TO HIM. Sally: NED? - YEP. YOU WON'T MAKE IT ANY WORSE, WILL YOU? - NO. YOU WON'T TELL HIM ABOUT YOU AND KATE? WHAT? ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU AND KATE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. YEAH, YOU DO. REMEMBER THAT NIGHT YOU CAME HOME WITH A BIG CUT ON YOUR HEAD? WHAT DID WE HAVE FOR DINNER? IT WAS YABBIES. I REMEMBER 'CAUSE I HAD TO GO GET THEM FROM THE DAM. I MUST HAVE BEEN -- WHAT WAS I -- 10, 11? I THOUGHT YOU WERE HURTING HER. Stop looking at me. Don't touch me. I FORGAVE YOU, NED, A LONG TIME AGO. [ SIGHS ] HOW COULD YOU? HOW? YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING? I DON'T RECKON CLIFF WAS ANY BETTER THAN YOU. HE WAS JUST MORE REMORSEFUL. MM. DID YOU KNOW THE CLOCK STOPPED ON IMPACT? NOBODY COULD FIGURE OUT WHY IT TOOK THEM SO LONG TO GET HOME FROM THE DANCE. BRUCE NEARLY DROVE HIMSELF CRAZY, TRYING TO PUT ALL THE PIECES TOGETHER. TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO FIGURE IT OUT, AS WELL. SEE, I RECKON CLIFF COULD HAVE LIVED WITH HIMSELF FOR KILLING HER. IT WAS THE OTHER STUFF HE COULDN'T LIVE WITH. YOU THINK -- YOU THINK CLIFF AND KATE -- WELL, WHAT DO YOU RECKON THEY WERE DOING OUT THERE? REALLY? YOU RECKON THEY WERE FUCKING STARGAZING? [ SNIFFLES ] WHAT ARE YOU DOING, NED? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY, NED? WHAT? THAT HE FAILED AGAIN? THAT HIS GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT WAS JUST A MESSED-UP LITTLE GIRL? NED, PLEASE DON'T! BRUCE? BRUCE? [ LABORED BREATHING ] OHH. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I REMEMBER ABOUT THAT LAST SUMMER? I REMEMBER THE CHRISTMAS PARTY AND NOT WANTING TO GO AND YOU TELLING ME THAT I HAD TO GO, THAT I HAD TO TAKE CARE OF MY SISTER TO BRING HER HOME WHEN SHE WANTED TO LEAVE. BUT I WOULDN'T. I DIDN'T. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY? DO YOU REMEMBER TAMARA FROM THE ROADHOUSE? IT'S JUST LIKE YOU SAID. IT'S MY WEAKNESS. [ CHUCKLES ] SO, YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK, OLD MAN. MUCH AS I WANTED TO NAIL YOU FOR CLIFF'S SUICIDE... I CAN'T MAKE IT STICK. IF ANYTHING, YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN TOUGHER ON HIM, YOU SHOULD HAVE SQUEEZED EVERY LAST DROP OF GOODNESS OUT OF HIM, AND THEN MAYBE HE WOULD HAVE PUT HIMSELF FIRST JUST FOR ONCE. MAYBE HE WOULD HAVE SAID, "NO, KATE, I'M NOT TAKING YOU HOME. I'M NOT GONNA DRIVE YOU HOME. I'M STAYING HERE," AND THEN I WOULD HAVE HAD TO DRIVE HER. WOULDN'T I? I WOULDN'T HAVE SWERVED FOR NO FUCKING ROO. [ SNIFFLES ] [ Sobbing ] I'M SORRY, DAD. I'M SO SORRY. I HATED YOU. I'm sorry, Dad. [ SOBBING ] Sally: NED? NED? [ BIRDS CHIRPING ] DAD ALWAYS SAID NO TWO PEOPLE WOULD GIVE A DAMN WHETHER OR NOT HE LIVED OR DIED. BUT YOU WAIT, WAIT TILL WORD GETS OUT. HALF THE COMMUNITY'S GONNA BE AT THE DOOR. YOU KNOW, I COULDN'T MAKE A DECISION BETWEEN THE BLUE AND THE GREEN SHIRT. WHAT DO YOU THINK? I LIKE THE STRIPE. IT'S FUNNY, ISN'T IT? NOW HE CAN'T ARGUE WITH ME, I CAN'T DECIDE. I RECKON THE GREEN. HMM? THAT LOOKS NICE, DOESN'T IT? YEAH. Priest: I AM GOING NOW TO PREPARE A PLACE FOR YOU. AND AFTER I HAVE GONE AND PREPARED YOU A PLACE, I SHALL RETURN TO TAKE YOU WITH ME, SO THAT WHERE I AM, YOU MAY BE, TOO. THIS IS THE GOSPEL OF THE LORD. AMEN. All: AMEN. NED... I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] WON'T YOU BE LONELY? I'VE GOT 20 KIDS HERE CALL ME "AUNTIE." I DON'T RECKON I CAN GET THAT LONELY. [ BIRDS CHIRPING ] IT'S FUNNY, YOU KNOW. A MAN CAN LIVE HIS WHOLE LIFE AND NEVER COP TO HIS GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT... ...YOU. [ HORN HONKS ] OW!
