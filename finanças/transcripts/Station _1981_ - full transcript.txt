Your wife is one thing, but think about the child. Think about how they will manage by themselves. Instead of leaving your family, it would be much smarter to leave your job. Plus, the Olympics... Some tea? No wonder your wife is upset. It's completely justified. I'm aware that it's not decent. But... it's all over now... I understand that it was a stupid thing to do. You really think so? Haven't you realized it yet? I had a suspicion, but... Even if it's stupid... but, boss... what can I do, if there's no other choice? I'm on the Olympic team, after all. If they lose, how will I be able to forgive myself? I keep thinking about my native home and mum's red rice with beans. The way she cries on the phone. But I have to represent my country. When I first heard her cry... and then my brother, my uncle, fishermen from Ofuyu town cooperative... A perpetrator in a white Toyota Corolla... after committing a crime at 13:30... got in a traffic accident on a slippery road not far from Toyohira cemetery. According to witnesses' testimony, he then headed north. Message from Sapporo Head Department. At 14:02 senior police officer Yokoyama passed away in the hospital from a gunshot wound. The case is now treated as murder. The perpetrator is in possession of the victim's gun. Urgent! 16th police department is calling Sapporo Head Department. Head Department! Intercept a white Corolla. Ishiyama Street, South-Center. Heading to Monami Park now. Roger that. All units, carry on pursuit. Sapporo Head Department! How about we look near Monami Park? But that's in the opposite direction. We have to carry on pursuit somehow. Alright. The officer who got shot died. It seems, the perpetrator was quite experienced. They say, he's the 'number 22'. They think so? Well... it's possible. Hey! Stop the car, please! Can I see your papers, please? Boss! Boss! Head Department! Sapporo Head Department! Officer Maruhachi was shot... Sapporo Head Department! Hey... Was Aiba able to pull out the gun? Was he? He wasn't? Mikami, you're a member of the shooting team, after all! I've always said that those are two completely different things... shooting at a target at the shooting range and shooting at a person. One shouldn't shoot at people! I dream that one day... the Japanese flag... will be raised over the Olympic stadium. This is my... innermost wish. Forget it. It's alright. Don't think about it. You have other important things to do. Everyone can chase criminals, but participating at the Olympics... Boss... Please, I have to have revenge. Give this case to me, please. Your case is the Olympics. It's an order from the Head of Hokkaido Police Department. Now that Aiba is dead, your time has come. We all count on you. Every police officer. No, the whole of Japan counts on you. In Yokoyama, police sergeant Ryo Aiba... was suddenly attacked by a perpetrator... who escaped with a gun in his hands. Last year, a police officer was shot in Osaka. The police are investigating whether it was the same 'number 22'. And now, to other news. The athlete, who had won a third place in the marathon at the Tokyo Olympics... 27-year-old Self-defense forces officer Kokichi Tsuburaya... left a note before committing suicide... today, around 11 a.m... in a dorm room of the SDF camp in Nerima-ku. Lieutenant Tsuburaya cut his carotid artery with a razor blade... and died of blood loss. He was found by his neighbor Seki Koizumi. Tsuburaya had taken part in the marathon at the Tokyo Olympics... won a third place and earned a bronze medal. He had been going to participate at this year's Mexico Olympics... but he pulled his heelstring in August last year. After which, he spent 3 months in the hospital. He had such a strong sense of responsibility... that he plunged into depression. In his farewell letter, he wrote with a shaking hand... 'I will never be able to run again.' Tsuburaya, come on! Come on! 'Farewell... father and mother... New Year sweet potatoes were so tasty. Mochi with dried persimmon were delicious too. Dear elder brother Toshio... Sushi was very tasty as well. Dear elder brother Katsumi... Poached apples in wine were very tasty. Dear elder brother Iwao... Fried fish in shisomeshi marinade was very tasty. Dear elder brother Kikuzo... Budoshu and Yomeishu wines were very tasty. Thank you for always having my laundry done. Dear elder brother Kozo... For giving me a ride in your car... Thank you very much. The cuttlefish was very tasty. Dear elder brother Masao... I'm sorry for the inconvenience I caused you. Yukio, Hideo, Mikio, Toshiko... Hideko, Ryosuke, Takahisa... Miyoko, Yukie, Mitsue... Akira, Yoshiyuki... Keiko, Yukihide, Yuko... Kii, Masatsugu... I wish you to become wonderful people. Father... mother... I'm out of breath and I can't run anymore. Forgive me for everything. My soul can't rest. Forgive me for all troubles and worries. Thank you for my life with you.' JUNE 1976 SUZUKO But this is Eiji! Eiji is here! Eiji! It's me... it's me... Eiji... Eiji... No, you were just a team member then... You'd just come back from the Munich Olympics, and now you're a coach. There are a lot of people from the police and the military... in the Japan shooting team. When I heard about it, I thought it was terrible. Shooting at the same target for hours without missing a single time. Have you bought this house? No, we rent it. We can never afford one like this. I see. Put this in the suitcase. This charm is from the Ofuyu shrine. Thank you. Is everything okay with Yoshiji? Yes, he's coming to the wedding. Can you return all this to Yoshiji? What makes him better than me? What makes this guy better than me? We know you! You're very good... I'm good, aren't I? Eiji, I'm good, right? You're great! Hey, where are you going? I need to take a leak. I'll come with you. It's an honor to take a leak with a good guy. Hey, we're in the schoolyard, after all. It won't do. We're going to get in trouble with the headmaster. Fuck the headmaster! Let's take a leak under his window! Yeah, let's piss all over there... Serves him right. Yoshiji, come with us. Fuyu is so pretty. Stop it, Yoshiji. Shut up. She looks like Sayuri Yoshinaga. Our Fuyu looks like Sayuri Yoshinaga? Of course. She does. She kind of does, if you look closely... Just look! She does, very much! Watch me... Let's compete who can do it higher! Who's there? Mitsuo, is that you? I'll have your diplomas withdrawn! The victim was wearing a red mini-skirt. Last summer a serial killer appeared in Sapporo. He attacked only women in red skirts. Well? Looks very similar. We have to start comparing this case to what happened in Sapporo a year ago. Did your younger sister's wedding go well? Yes. Tatsumi from Rumoi police department, reporting for duty. I'm under Mikami's command. In Hokkaido police department they told me that you recently moved here. Yes, it's better like this. Why? The time has come. There's very little time left till the Olympics. How about giving this to Mitake's team? It's also worth finding out how Rikiishi is doing. Masake, we have a suspect. Goro Yoshimatsu, 30 years old. He has a criminal record for assault. Until June last year, he had lived in Sapporo, Shikitaku-North, 24. He worked as a cook in a local restaurant called Drifting Ice. His parents lived in Mashike-Cho, Bekkari, 236. Both are dead now. He also has a younger sister. She works in the Kazemachi tavern, near Mashike station. She lives at the same address. There was a motorbike near the tavern last night... Wait a minute. What? Mikami, what were you trying to say? This is the person who was wanted in Sapporo. My elder brother has gone to Tokyo. When? Three days ago. Where in Tokyo? I don't know. He said, 'I'll probably go to Tokyo.' What did my brother do? Will you see him? Will I see him...? He might come back, or maybe not. I think, he probably will. Or maybe not. He has to come back one day. Where was he on June 10? - My brother? - Yes. June 10? Thursday night. Thursday... He was at home. All the time? Yes, all the time... we were watching TV... He said, 'Suziko, let's watch Eleven PM...' Suziko? What? Isn't it Suzuko with a 'U'? My brother often says Suziko, although it's actually Suzuko. And before, he used to say Sizuko... When my late father went to register me... he said 'Sizuko', but they heard it as 'Suzuko'. So they wrote it down like this. So mum called me both Sizuko and Suzuko. And then mum died from a kidney disease. I still can't believe it. Such a shame. Brother cried a lot... and then... We'll talk about it next time. Mikami! Excuse me. June 10... The tire tracks match. Looks like it's our guy. This guy took great care of his sister. This Suzuko isn't exactly skinny. Some neighbors even started joking about it, and one fisherman was teasing her. So he caught him and beat him within an inch of his life. This is when he was arrested for assault. Yes, it looks similar... Red skirt. What could it mean? Everything seems to match. When I was talking to her in the police department, she was also wearing a red skirt. Still, she's usually a quiet and decent girl. - I'll show you! - What did you say? Here's what! - What...? I didn't do anything. - He didn't touch Fuyu. When he does, it'll be too late. Stop it. - For Fuyu... - Don't ever touch her! Eiji, stop it. She's your sister! But don't you dare hit my brother! Enough, both of you. What are you doing? He sells tractors. It's terrible. Few farmers around here have tractors. - Most people have boats. - Yes. You also wanted to buy an engine for a boat, didn't you? I'll ask someone if they can sell it. Is that him again? He follows her everywhere. Suzu is a pretty girl, of course. Let's go. Are they lovers? Of course, they are. Why not? These guys love a woman for what she has between her legs. If they get something into their heads, they will do it. What is it? I decided to get married. - To Yoshiji? - No. To someone from Kitamiesashi. Do you love him? Do you really love him? Yes, I do. He hasn't got in touch with you since? No. That's bad. Maybe... Maybe what? Maybe, he won't come back here anymore. Why not? He might come, but I don't think so. I can feel it. Why do you say so? Apparently, my brother doesn't love me. He doesn't? Probably not... Why do you say that? We had an argument. You had an argument? Yes. When? The night before he left. The night before? Yes. That is, on June 10... That's right. After the show finished, we didn't talk or sleep till the morning. Till the morning? Yes. You stayed up all night? Yes. You were together in the apartment all night? And he didn't leave home for an hour? No, we were together all the time, but we had an argument. Around 3:30, when it was dawning... my brother said, 'I'm leaving. Goodbye...' Why such urgency? I'm sorry to disturb you on a day off. So what happened? You didn't get the message from the team leader? No. I see... They want to change the coach. Me? Yes. Change the coach? Yes. Is that an order from above? No. It's not that. So, they're dissatisfied with me. It's too early to say, but apparently yes. They're inclined towards Mitake and Saka. Is there someone named Mikami? You're wanted on the phone. Mikami, the girl is getting on the train... Yes! Rumoi... Rumoi station... Change trains to Fukagawa and Sapporo here. To change trains to Fukagawa and Sapporo, go to platform 4. From Sapporo... a man named Mitake called Mikami many times. I see... The tea's ready. So, tomorrow at 8? Yes. Alright. Good night. - You too... - Good night. I'll have a walk in the city. At this hour? You called me a few times? Yes, I heard. Yes. Yes... why not... nothing. Why are you so concerned about it? Sorry, brother. What seems to be the problem? No, he's a team member. Yes... I see... it will do. Maybe, it's for the good. Yes, we'll talk when I come back. No, it's unclear yet. - How much? - 500 yen. Careful! Children should go to sleep. Who are you calling children? Hey, man, what are you doing here? Hey! I'm talking to you, dumb ass! What do you want here? Hands off. I'll ask you again, what do you want here? You're asking for trouble. Fine... you, scum, let's go out... Come here, shithead, I'll show you. Asshole! Stop it, damn it! Bastard! Motherfucker! I'll show you, motherfucker! You win. You think nobody knows who you are? You're a cop. You're spying on Suzuko, right? Alright. I won't tell anyone. She's a naive girl. Don't you dare trick her. Naive? Suzuko? You don't know women. A woman can seem naive, but, in reality, everything is different. Did you want something? Yes. I want to cooperate... If you're okay with that, I'll tell you where her brother is hiding. I see that you are. I can see it in your face. Hold on, cop. I see you have a hot temper. She tells cops she doesn't keep in touch with her brother. My gut is telling me she's lying. I know... They're connected. You probably know about this scandal. They're lovers. It may well be, real ones... No one can say for sure when it comes to Suzuko. She's protecting her brother. You'll see. She's lying to you, this bitch. If you want information... you have to trust me. She'll tell me everything. She's in love with me. I know. We don't need it. Don't be afraid. Do we have a deal? The police are in trouble, aren't they? It was in the papers a couple of days ago. What's going to happen to our police? Anyway, you can count on me. Everything will be alright. Don't worry. It doesn't look like this girl is lying to us. Moreover, I don't see the need to have her under surveillance. But she's his sister. She must be protecting her brother. She's not that kind of person. She doesn't have the brains for it, she's a simple girl. Or, maybe, you just think so. Besides, the tire tracks match. Although, fingerprints... Mikami, it's for you. How many days have we been watching this girl? Seven days. It's time to move to the overt stage of the investigation. I think so too. I see. Tatsumi called. As we suspected, his sister knows everything. She's meeting him tomorrow evening. Where exactly? We don't know yet. Here you go. No pepper left. Sorry. Hello. Yes. I see. Everything's alright. Yes. I see. But... Brother... It's not important. We'll talk then. What is it? You changed your mind about marrying me? Then what is it? Nothing. Will you come tomorrow, as promised? Be a good girl. Why not? But you are. No, I'm not. Why not? Maybe... I'm the worst person in the world. Look, it's funny. Do you like it? TICKET TO KAMISUNAGAWA Sunagawa station. Change to Kamisunagawa on platform 4. Change to Utashinai on platform 3. You're having problems with the Olympic team at such a time. I'm very sorry. It's so unexpected. Thank you... Would you like to transfer to the initial training department this time? It would suit you. What do you think? Boss. What? I'm an ordinary cop. If there is an order, I will obey it. KAMISUNAGAWA STATION The station is surrounded! Why have you put on the uniform, idiot? Hey! What's wrong with you? It's Kamisunagawa. Listen... Why have we come here? Is your brother going to be here? Yes, he is. Brother... Brother! Brother! Brother... It's me, Suziko... Suziko... It's me, Suziko... Mikami! I can't believe it. This stupid girl... has been fooling us all this time. DECEMBER 1979 KIRIKO Ryosuke! It's your mother! Stop it! Stop! I beg you! Come out and surrender! Please! Ryosuke! Come out and surrender. Honjo, stop it! You said yourself... What was that? No! Don't go! Boss! Enough! I promise! I understand. The food will be delivered right now. Deliver food for the perpetrator and hostages. All police officers, back off! Back off, everyone. Come out! Left! Move it, dumb ass! Right! Relax. Where are the chopsticks for hostages? Don't move! This is my Ryosuke! Ryosuke! Ryosuke! Murderers! Cops are murderers! Murderers! Cops are murderers! HOSTAGES WERE RELEASED 48 HOURS LATER FROM GORO YOSHIMATSU December 20. Today, azuki mochi was cooked for me. Thank you for constant care. In the inmate's mind, the outer world looks strange. I'm sincerely grateful to you. This is a letter from a stranger with best wishes. Only a person, sentenced to death, can feel something like this. Today, I was told that tomorrow, on December 21 at 6:00... the sentence will be executed. When you receive this letter, I won't be among the living. I'm ready to die, but my hands are still shaking a little. I'm sincerely grateful to you for that old affair. A farewell poem. 'I see a bright spot in the dark...' 'Now I proceed to the station's lights full of trust.' December 20, 1979. Asahikawa prison. Goro Yoshimatsu. Brother, it's me, Suziko... Cops are murderers! Murderers! Murderers! Here I am. Ah, brother... it's so nice. Give it to me. No, it's too heavy... Unfortunately not. Come back later. The next one is at 13:57. I see. More and more people are driving through Ofuyu every year. They cause a lot of trouble. Here, I've filled it in. Thank you... Mikami. Look what you wrote... 'Profession - single.' What kind of profession is that? Mum! The thing is... There are no ships. I can't make it... It's impossible... I'm telling you, it's impossible... KAZEMACHI TAVERN - Hello. - Welcome. What would you like? Katsudon, please. - One bowl of katsudon. - Just a minute. - Waitress... - Yes? And a bottle of saké. Alright. Would you like me to heat it up? Yes, please. - A bottle of hot saké. - Coming right up. Kazemachi tavern. Yes, it's me. Yes. No, three days ago. No, three days ago. And the memorial service too... Everything's alright, don't worry. There's snow everywhere, we can't bury yet. Yes... yes... Suzu, here's your saké. Just a minute. Only in spring now, sorry. Thank you. Yes. Thank you. Thank you... yes. Here you go. Suzu, you'll catch a cold... You're so hard-working. Uncle, I'm glad to see you. GORO YOSHIMATSU Welcome! - Are you open? - Yes, come in, please. - One bottle of hot saké... - Alright. - I'm so tired... - Are you? It's surprising that you work on the 30th. You think so? Almost all the other places were closed. Would you like some squid? Freshly boiled. I'll bring it. See, I persuaded you. I'm afraid, there won't be anyone else coming. That's for sure. One can meet only god at such hour. I'm not that great of a god. Maybe great, but not a god. Are you local? No, I'm from Ofuyu. I see... waiting for the ship? Yes. And you? Are you from Mashike yourself? Yes. From Utanobori. You're from Utanobori? Do you know the place? Probably, from Otoineppu? You know everything. My sister moved there. Where exactly? Kitamiesashi. - She got married, didn't she? - Yes. I see... It's hot now. Here. There's no cup... - What? - There's no cup. Oh, sorry. - Will a glass do? - Sure. Well? Good. Why don't you drink with me? With pleasure. From a glass too maybe? Yes, thank you. It's enough. To you! So good. - I'll heat up another one? - Yes. You were at the station... this afternoon, weren't you? How do you know? I saw you. No way. I saw you once and I remembered you. I'll give you some free potatoes. - Was your husband supposed to arrive? - What do you mean? You seemed to be waiting for someone. No, I don't have a husband. I'm single. For now. But I'm not exactly a girl anymore. Here you go. - Thank you. - Help yourself. Is it tasty? Yes. You can be honest with me. What about you? What about me? Is your wife waiting for you in Ofuyu? No. You're lying. I'm not. It's true. So you're single too? No, I'm not. Definitely not. A long time ago... Yes... I met someone, but... You broke up? Yes. How long ago? More than ten years ago... And you haven't got married since? No. You must value your freedom then. Why didn't you go to see your relatives for the New Year? There must be someone waiting for you in Utanobori? There is. There is, but... Because of that... Oh... Aki Yashiro. It's my favorite song. It's very nice... Saké is better when it's hot The best snack is grilled squid A woman is best when she's silent Light is best when it's dimmed Last New Year, my friend... gassed herself in her flat in Sapporo. On January 3... She worked at the bar in Susukino. Did you know that? Did I know what? That women who works in bars and clubs... often commit suicide at end of the old or at the beginning of the new year. Do you know why? No. Because their men come back. Because this is the time when all of those playboys... come back home. Ah... thank you. A bar is best when there are no decorations It's great when your windows overlook the harbor Suddenly it got sad... It's great when a lighthouse is heard through the fog Little by little, I sip my drink You know what... if the ferry doesn't arrive tomorrow, let's go to the cinema in Rumoi together? You'll relax a bit. Alright? What month... were you born in? In February. And the day? 22nd. Ah... Pisces. I knew it. Why? The thing is... Pisces and Capricorns go well together. I'm a Capricorn, I was born on January 6. So... we go well together. If we stay together, everything will be alright. Are you leaving? Yes. Tell me... I didn't scream too loud, did I? No. I was told before... I'm so embarrassed! No, you didn't scream too loud. I hope they didn't hear you on Sakhalin. Just a minute... Where is... Here. Do you like it? Take it. Thank you. It's tasty. Everyone, this is my wife. Yukio! - Yukio, what are we going to do? - We need a snack. - Let's go drink a glass or two. - Let's go! Where to? What do you suggest? Choose yourselves. What do you say, Kami? Suzuko? So many years have passed... You're still working here? Well, take care. Come on... Excuse me... I have to go. Good night! Open the window, overlooking the south What do you do? What? Your profession... I've been thinking since yesterday. Guess. A miner? A lumberjack then? Right? How did you guess? So I am right. I just have a good intuition. Boss, I remember those days with sadness. Everyone was screaming, 'Olympics! Olympics!'like crazy. Everyone wanted me to train them then. Now everyone's turned into shooting machines. Only then did I feel useful. Sometimes I feel I'm fed up. Frankly speaking, I think it would be better to leave the police. It's true, I'm not lying. When I remember criminals from Hokkaido... it seems that everyone looks like guys from my native town. It's... Who is it? It's him, that asshole, no doubt. Boss, let me do it myself. Be careful... It's going to be alright. I have an order for your arrest. I hope everything's clear. Come with me. Can't wait to finish the job? Mitake! Hello. It's me. Yes. Are you alone? Yes. You're watching the 30th Red & White New-Year contest. I'm at the bar, can you come? I'm just sitting here, I didn't even open the bar. We could watch Red & White together. So, Top-Batter from the Reds. And Kawai-Panchi from the Whites. Our debut-Mako Ishino with the song 'Julia's Rival'. Have a go, you have a chance to love me tonight Your breasts are leaning against the window A golden pendent is hanging from your neck It's not good to point the finger at Julia Stop pretending you don't notice it Julia's rival, you will be defeated! I hit the bull's eye... Pow-pow! You're finished I defeated you KIRIKO BAR Where are you working at the moment? In Sapporo. In Sapporo? Is it alright? What? In Sapporo? Is it better here? Who do you have in Ofuyu? My mum and my elder brother. And they don't want you to come back home? They did before. Are they fishermen? Yes. Why did you become a lumberjack? If only you went back to Ofuyu... You think it would be better? Of course... It's good to be back in your native home. So, we have one more contestant left. Why didn't you go home? So, we have one more contestant left. Why didn't you go home? The Reds are performing the 8th song. Please welcome. Such a nice song. I love it. Saké is better when it's hot The best snack is grilled squid A woman is best when she's silent It's as if it was about me. Light is best when it's dimmed Little by little, I sip my drink Only memories are left Tears are rolling down my cheek I'm singing this fisherman's song... to seagulls, that's how drunk I am Poor lonely woman I stay in bed late... My heart is torn A bar is best when there are no decorations It's great when your windows overlook the harbor It's great when a song isn't trite It's great when a lighthouse is heard through the fog Little by little, I sip my drink The heart is moaning and whimpering Remembering those days and that girl... I sing this fisherman's song... It's still 1979. For everyone all over the country, who are saying farewell to this year... the choir is singing The Glow of a Firefly. Snowflakes outside the window, like firefly lights Leaf to a leaf, days are forming a pile You know... What? It's about to come. 1980 or 55th year of the Showa period. May it bring light and hope! Let's go to the temple. Come in... Welcome... I'll go first. - 160 yen. - Here you go. - Your change is 40 yen. - Keep it. - Gran, give me a tangerine! - Alright... Girls get the biggest ones... Boys, stop it. Mum's out of her mind. She forgot to give children money for the New Year. Our kids have received it three times already. And didn't give back? That wouldn't be very nice. Why not? She's weird. She forgets what happened five minutes ago... but she remembers the old days perfectly. Yes, she keeps telling stories about catching herring. Mum... here is the New-Year money from gran. Really? How nice. Hide it, maybe she'll give you more. Mum... Don't. I'll go alone. Did you hear me? I can go alone. You won't be able to give best wishes without me properly. What place did you get at the last year's Olympics? What are you talking about? It was a long time ago, about ten years ago... What are you talking about, idiot! Do you know that this summer... highway 231... was finally opened? Now it's easy to get to Ofuyu... from Rumoi, Haboro, Wakkanai, and Ishikari. Now our faraway island of Ofuyu will be booming, and money will flow. So you can quit the police... and come back to us anytime. Now we don't have to leave to find a job, like we did before. What you wrote in your letter, was it serious? Yes. You really want to quit the police? As soon as I find another job here. I wrote the same thing in response. You'll find a job here for sure. We really need people here. Still... it's somehow unexpected. I wonder what happened. Nothing. I've been thinking about it for a while. We can't go on living like before... mum is gradually losing her memory. But... are you really going to quit the police? Now that you've become a shooting instructor. Is it because of what happened in Sapporo last year? I see now. You're irreplaceable. Such a job becomes unbearable. Right? Brother, are you sleeping? What? Are you angry with me... for what happened recently? What? I saw your Naoko. I often go to Saitama on business. Are you angry? I wanted to see Yoshitaka. He's grown up so much. He's already in secondary school. He's 1 78 cm tall. He plays on a basketball team. Does she have someone? No. It seems she's alone. She works as a waitress in a bar in Ikebukuro. She's homesick. This is her phone number. I'll put it here. Get on it. Hello, it's me... Michio told me. Same as usual. I'm a detective, as before. It's still going on. Is Yoshitaka alright? Probably... I heard. And yourself? Is everything alright? Maybe, I... What happened? Hello? What's wrong? Mum! I'll come again! What happened? I decided to meet you. You knew when I'd come? I have a good intuition. Is he still your boyfriend? The one we met in the temple on the New Year. Did you understand? Well, yes... Damn... We can break up. It's a short episode from the past. Besides, it was unrequited love. It was a long time ago. It's over now. You meeting me here... is it a good thing? You're leaving. So silly... When are you going to come back again? Maybe soon. Really? Yes. Maybe then... I can stay for good. Really? Let's go to Sapporo together right now. I'm joking. I'm not that importunate. Alright, let's go. Passengers leaving Rumoi, please prepare your tickets for control. I'll be waiting here. Maybe... you'll come. There's still time. Bye now. Ki! What? Hold on. What? The charm. From the Ofuyu shrine. RESIGNATION NOTICE From Eiji Mikami, sergeant of First department of Hokkaido criminal police. Please accept my resignation due to personal reasons. January 3, 1980 (55th year of the Showa period). To the head of Hokkaido police, superintendent Goro Mizunuma. Accept my apologies, dear superintendent Otaguro. I'm much indebted to you for this long service. I'm very ashamed, but I have no energy left. I stopped receiving satisfaction from the job, and I doubt I will be able to carry out my duties. It's not a spur of the moment. This is my wish. 20 years as a police officer... it's all my youth. All this time, I represented Japan... and did my best to perform well at the Olympics. I will never forget this honor, which I did not deserve. Even after my resignation, I will be proud to have been a police officer. But now I'm starting a new life. January 3, 1980. Eiji Mikami. Rumoi, Rumoi Station... Excuse me. Where are you coming from? From Mashike. What were you doing in Mashike? I went to my native Ofuyu. Excuse me, can I see your ID? Yes. I apologize. Has anything happened? A police officer was shot in Mashike. Hey! What? We have just received a message. What does it say? The perpetrator is this man. - I'm sorry. - It's nothing. It's a short episode from the past. It's over now. When are you going back to Sapporo? Don't tell me. Let's go to Sapporo together right now. Mikami! The message mentions a woman. They gave her name, but the line disconnected. - Excuse me... - Yes? The Kiriko bar is closed. Where is the owner? Well, where could she be... - Hey, Toda! - Yes? Do you know the owner's address? She moved to the first council house. Where is that? Kiriko! Kiriko! Kiriko! Who is it? It's Mikami. What happened? I'm sorry. I have to tell you something. I'm going to bed. That charm that I gave you... What is it? You haven't gone to Sapporo? Are you alone? We have to talk. It's not for long. Come out for a minute. Please, leave! Another time... Leave! I'm sorry, come some other time! Morioka. How do you know? We met once. Twelve years ago. Don't you remember? On the bridge over the Toyohiragawa river. No! It's not that! He's not a police officer! No! How... No... I see now... So, it was you who called? It was you who called the police in the afternoon? Did Morioka notice? Did he? I don't know. Did he threaten you with a gun when detective Mikami entered? No. He didn't. So he didn't threaten you? I was hiding him. You were hiding him? Yes. I thought I would be able to break free somehow. It's strange. Still... You knew he would be arrested and yet you called the police? Then why were you hiding him? Something doesn't match here... Doesn't match, you say? No, it doesn't. Still... he's a man, and I'm a woman. Can I have a cigarette? Yes... here you go. Can I come in for a minute? I'm so tired... The way you want... Sachiko, live the way you want... Travelling alone isn't that bad You're ready to fall, but you're quick to get up Do you have a train schedule? Come back into my arms The way you want... Sachiko, live the way you want... Even if your heart is wounded Cry a little and come back A stop in Fukagawa... Too long to wait. Fast train to Rishiri: 3 hours 46 minutes... In any case, there doesn't seem to be a choice. Saké is better when it's hot The best snack is grilled squid A woman is best when she's silent Light is best when it's dimmed Little by little, I sip my drink Only memories are left Tears are rolling down my cheek I'm singing this fisherman's song... to seagulls, that's how drunk I am Poor lonely woman I stay in bed late... My heart is torn The train to Fukagawa is arriving. Show your tickets, please. A bar is best when there are no decorations It's great when your windows overlook the harbor Suzu! A single ticket to Sapporo. What are you doing here at this time? Are you going somewhere? I'm going to Sapporo. I'm going to find a new job there. Really? It was a spontaneous decision... I'm sorry I didn't say anything. I see... - It really is unexpected. - It is. You will probably... feel lonely there. I'll be back someday. Suzu... take this! What for? Go ahead, take it. You can eat it on the train. Thank you. You're sure to feel lonely. And if it gets too lonely... I'll sing this fisherman's song...
