(ambient music) (ambient music) (slow piano music) (orchestra music) - [Man] From the very beginning, cars were designed to be as powerful and safe as possible. And yet, the automobile remains the most dangerous vehicle on Earth. With the Monolith we introduced a whole new way of thinking. A car as a completely safe environment. (guitar music) Adamantine nanotech body armor, ultra thin bullet proof windows. 25 different state of the art anti-hazard sensors. Our brand new exclusive vault mode. Cars are a place where most robberies happen. Where women are subject to harassment. So we decided to finally build the Monolith, allowing our drivers to utterly eliminate any risk. Our Monolith will feature interactive artificial intelligence, a live driving companion and security manager. Her name is Lilith, you'll love to get to know her. All these features make Monolith quite simply the safest car ever built, and the safest place for you and your family. (electronic music) (baby babbling) - [Woman] Okay, let's find some music for you, okay. - [Car Voice] Good evening, how can I help? - David, look, we have a talking car. - [Car Voice] We haven't met. My name is Lilith. What would you like me to call you? - I guess just Sandra is fine. - [Lilith] Justsandra, did I pronounce that correctly. (laughing) - No, there's just, my name is Sandra. - [Lilith] Sandra, did I pronounce that correctly? - Yes, considering you're a car. - [Lilith] Hi little human in the backseat, what's your name?. - [Sandra] How do you know there's a baby in the car? - [Lilith] According to US demographics, 30 pound person is most usually a baby. - Wow, I'm impressed. That's David. - [Lilith] Hello David. (video game music) (laughing) - Hey, Lilith, do you know how much I weigh too? - [Lilith] 122.4 pounds. - Okay, I got it's that's enough. - [Sandra] Lilith, do you store that information about the weight? - [Lilith] Of course, for safety and comfort reasons, I customize and continuously improve my interface. - Have there ever been other people with different weights in this car? - [Lilith] Displaying latest available data. - Okay, so, that must be Carl. Then, that's T. Wayne, and I guess his girlfriend. Who's this starving bitch? - [Lilith] Sandra, I can't understand. (sighing) (car phone beeping) Incoming call, Carl. (car phone beeping) - Look who it is. - Hey buddy (laughs). - Daddy. - [Carl] Oh I miss you. - So I called you about a half hour ago.

Here's turtle. Play with turtle, okay. So how was your flight? - It was alright. A lot of turbulence. They made us keep our belts buckled til we got to LA, and there was this woman. - Where are you? Are staying at the hotel near the airport again? - I like planes, you're the one that's afraid of them. - You like stewardesses. - Can we talk about the elephant in the room here? How's the new car, do you like it? - Yeah, I mean the car is fantastic. It's just I don't know, I wasn't really expecting an armored super car. I feel like one of your rappers. - Anything to keep my little man safe. I installed the Monolith app on your phone. It can control every function in the car. Have you tried it? - I haven't really tried it much. My little co-pilot won't let me. - [Carl] You really shouldn't let him use your phone, baby. (laughing) - It's easy for you to say when you're hundreds of miles away. (door knocking) - Look, I'm really sorry baby, I gotta go. - Sorry Carl, it's just, it just doesn't feel right. You being so far away all the time. (loud knocking) - [Carl] They're waiting for me at the studio to finish the mix, so I'll call you when I get done, alright. - Don't even worry about it. I'll be asleep by the time you get home. - Where are you going? - Your parents house. - Poopy, yeah. - I love you, you know that right? - I know. (electronic music) Please, please, baby, please.
