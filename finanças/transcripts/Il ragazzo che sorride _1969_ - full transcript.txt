Here. This goes here. This there. This goes here and this one on top. My head… Here. Antonio, get a hammer. -What are you putting up? -We are taking it off. And then, what will you put up? We only take stuff off. Then other people will come. -When will they come to put it up? -After we're done taking it off. What a wonderful answer. That's crazy! Sorry, it's my fault. I should have thought about the recoil. -What do you think about it? -It's beautiful. Really beautiful. Amazing! Wonderful! -Look how amazing it is! -Sir… This grey is so perfect! It's not exactly the Mona Lisa! You did more! You invented a shade of grey that didn't exist! You can believe me because my wife teaches art history! -What does she do? -She teaches art history. -Thank you. -Who will enjoy this beauty? -The owner. -What does he do? -A retailer. -Of what? I don't know. Maybe with this fancy new color it could be a jewelry store, or a boutique… -But nowadays it could be anything. -Like? -A tinsmith. -A plumber? -It's the same thing. -Goodbye, I'm busy. -I have an idea for a new yellow… -Good, show it to me. I'm sorry. No, I'll get dirty. Goodbye. I complimented this ugly grey and I didn't find out anything. -Ah, that's the couch. -Isn't that obvious? -Then there will be a counter… -There will be no counter. -Are you bringing it later? -No. And what will he do with no counter? -What do you care? -I own the shop next door. I don't want competition. Would you be so kind to tell me what will he sell, with no counter? -What do you care? -I see, you don't know. I don't know and I don't care. -We just load and unload! -There's no need to raise your voice! How rude! -Did you unload? -Can't you see? No, I heard it! Oh, well. BACK SOON Who am I? The big bad wolf! No! Then it's my big kitty cat! Now you're right! -I knew it was you! -I didn't scare you, did I? -Not at all. -I'm glad. How are you? -A little better. -Are you still in pain? -It comes and goes. -He must be kicking you! He's kicking hard! Let's hope that when he comes out he'll have more respect. Maybe he'll just slap us! You're so pretty. Pregnancy suits you! -It suits you really well. -My pregnancy suits you too! Do you think so? Yes, since I've been pregnant you are more and more handsome. Don't tell me or I'll get excited. -Kitty cat, there is one thing… -Yes. I still haven't found out who bought the shop next to ours. -It doesn't matter. -Right. Excuse me. Hello? Yes, I'm Mr. Leccisi. Who's calling? What a nice surprise. It's Giorgio! Giorgio, how are you? No! For real? A Distinction? And Valedictorian too? I'll call you Mr. Engineer! When? Tonight? I can't. Tilde is in bed, contractions come and go. Drop by for a few minutes. Without you, we'll have to cancel the party. -Did you hear Livia? -If Tilde will let me go… I'll pop by your house later this evening. -See you later. -Later! What are you doing? The waiters… Let's go to the garden. We need flowers for tonight. Alone at last, without waiters! We are like an old married couple. When we'll be old for real, time will not ruin a love like ours. My life with you I will renew every day I listen to a new music Now that you are here with me And if you for a second Could get into my soul You would understand that every moment I only think that We can never leave One another Not even for a second Because time isn't life without you I'm listening to a new music That will float on air for us That will float on air for us Giorgio, Livia! We are here! -Congratulations! -Well done, Giorgio! -Congratulations to both of you. -Thank you. -You have been outstanding. -Me? You have no idea how much! Giorgio! -Good evening. -My Giorgio! After such a success, I had to come and give you a kiss. And this… is from my wife. Her spirit is with us, but her bump is way too big now. -Thank you. -Congratulations to you too, Livia. You picked the right man. Well done. I bet you will be able to pick the right dishwasher too. -Should I marry a dishwasher? -We didn't think of that! You must forgive me, but the electrical appliances ads are driving me crazy! I'll leave you to your guests and I'll go greet your parents. If you'll excuse me. -Congratulations and good evening. -Hi. Mrs Limentani and professor Manzoni. -Nice to meet you. -Me too. What do you teach? -Art history. -How strange! Just like my wife! I used to teach physics. Now I own a shop. They were Giorgio and Livia's professors. It's fair to say that their young love bloomed under our nose. And since love is contagious, it bloomed for us too! Students and teachers got married at the same time. This is doctor Scandini, a renowned gynaecologist. Really? You're just what I needed! You see, I came because I didn't want to upset Giorgio. I must run back home because my wife is regnant. Sorry, I meant "pregnant". What did I say? -Congratulations. -Thank you. -May I ask you a question? -Of course. When contractions come and go, are we near or far? I'd say more far than near. If she doesn't have constant pain, the birth is never near. That's good! I can stay half an hour longer. Whatever happens, they can always call you here. Of course, Mr.. But when someone is about to become a father… -For the first time? -No! It's the third time. -I am a father twice. -A stork already came to your house. You bet! Timmy is a very good blender! Forgive me. Since I quit teaching and opened a homeware shop, I am surrounded by commercials! We are here to celebrate Giorgio's graduation. Today, an engineer degree is no longer a finish line but just a start to a long path full of work and sacrifices. Giorgio knows this. In his life he did so many things and he even supported himself while studying. He's ready to face his future. Congratulations to Giorgio. And good luck for the future! -Good luck! -Congratulations! Thank you for being here to share my happiness. You all came. My school mates, my old physics professor… and Livia, who's now my wife. Maybe those were the best and happiest days of our lives. Years we'll never forget. Five years passed and it seems like yesterday. I hope that our friendships will never end. -Congratulations! -Bravo! -I love you more and more. -You're so old fashioned! Say, "I want you just like the first day." I like to be old fashioned. I love you more and more. -Unbelievable, isn't it? -What is? That they've been married four years. They look like two kids who just met! It's better this way. Love doesn't last long nowadays. People get married and they part ways after six months. That's true. Tilde and I would part ways just for the pleasure of marrying again! And you keep the stork busy! She can come to my house whenever she wants. Enough, Filippo. Let her come to Giorgio and Livia as well! -We'd love to become grandparents. -Of course, you're right! -Excuse me, Sir. A phone call for you. -It's my wife? -Your maid. Come, it's urgent. -Where's the phone? -This way. -Go with him, don't leave him alone. -What could I do? -Comfort him. He's panicking about the birth. -If you want me to… -Stay, it's not what you think. When pain comes and goes, the event is still very far away. It's time! The pain is no longer coming and going, she's in terrible pain all the time! -What should I do? -Run back home! Of course. I must run back home. It's 15 kilometers! It'll take me forever! Call the hospital, they need to send an ambulance. -The hospital? What hospital? -Yours. Do I have a hospital? I don't remember. And you? -Of course. -Go phone them, please! -Do I have to phone them? -Yes, go! -He's shellshocked! -He'll send an ambulance to my home. -Who will take me home? -Don't you have a car? Yes, but I can't drive it. I'm so nervous -that I'd make my son an orphan. -I'll take you. Giorgio, my saviour! Giorgio will take me. Let's go. -Where did the doctor go? -He's coming. Calm down, everything is in hand. -Is it a boy? -No, the ambulance is on its way. -Excuse me, I'm too excited. -Of course, it's natural. What are we waiting for? -I'll be waiting at the hospital. -And if my wife needs help? -You must come with me. -No, there's no need for that. -I'll go to the hospital. -What if we get a flat tire? I'm talking to my former students now. Can someone follow us? -Me! -I knew it! What solidarity! Let's go! My hat! Waiter! Where's my hat? He'll faint before getting there! Tilde! Excuse me! Tilde, my darling! -I'm in so much pain! -You're so beautiful! -Hurry up. -I'll be here. Stay calm. -I'm with you. -Stay behind! -I'm with you. -You go away! -I must go with my wife! -Go away! -She's my wife! -Hurry, close the door! Don't worry, I'll be right behind you! I knew that the ambulance would get a flat tire! Damn it! Have you got a flat tire? Where is the jack? -No! -Which tire is it? You don't want to do it? I'll send you to jail! Speak! What's going on? -What's happening? -It's time! No! Is it? Will my son be born in the street? Where's the doctor? Doctor! Doctor! Everything is fine. Calm down. He said that everything is fine. I'm calm. -Guys, go get him a cognac! -Yes! -Are you feeling OK? -You're so kind! A cognac! Hot water! Hurry! Hot water! So much pain! Poor Tilde, she must be in so much pain! Down this cognac. -It will make you feel better. -Thank you. -Here! -Hot water. -Don't think about me. -Drink up. More hot water! I'm in so much pain! -Professor… -Tilde, we are suffering! Your wife is giving birth, not you. What do you know? Her pain is my pain. Help me get up. At my age I can still have children, but I can't stand up unaided. Thank you very much. Give it to me, I'll take it to her. I'll feel like I've done something for my son too. -Doctor! -What? -Hot water. -We don't need anymore! -You said you wanted it. -Leave us alone. A baby is coming. And he's telling me! As if I didn't know that! -I'm the father. -There's no need to get upset. -Calm down. -I feel dizzy. Be patient with me. Congratulations to the father! Here! -Move out of his way! -It will do you good. Make the poor man sit down. -Here's a chair for grandpa! -I'm the father! Really? Congratulations! Are you the father? Congratulations. -Come! -Congratulations! He's born! Doctor! How is my wife? -Everything went well. -When will I see the baby? -Soon, together with his sister. -What? You have twins! Twins! That's why I was in so much pain! If you agree, tomorrow you can take the reins of the research office. -Mineral research? -No, market research. -You gave me a desk, a salary. -You had a wife, you had to study. -And I thank you for that. -Let's not talk about gratitude. I'm glad that you married Livia, she needs a man like you. We need one another. Four years are proof of that. But I have a degree in Mineral Engineering, I intend to use it. I want to build my path with Livia alone, with my work. I hope that you, of all people, will be able to understand. I understand you, Giorgio. I'd have liked you less if you didn't say that. Let's go to the bar You don't want a job, at least let me buy you a drink. Here we go. Perfect. HOME -Hi! -Hi, Nicola. Hi, Emanuela. -How are they the little ones? -They ate like piggies. They are so cute! In this tiny crib! Tiny? It's as big as a bus! How sweet. They look just like you! They look like you, Filippo. No, you. Let's give credit to Tilde when it's due and to Filippo when it's due. These two look like you, they are rather ugly. -Say it again, if you dare! -I dare! -But honestly, they are cute! -Like me? Without glasses and moustache and 50 years younger. Let's change topic. I finally found out who bought the shop next door. -It's no competition. -Great. What will they sell? Homewares. Kitchen stuff, furniture and garden supplies. -Who told you? -They hung up the sign. I'll go see if the owner is there and I'll introduce myself, see what kind of guy he is. -Alright. Bye. -I'm going. My kitty cat! No, you're always first. You first, and then it's their turn. Bye -Kitty cat! -What? While you're there, see if you can get a big hose. -What for? -For Aunt Giovanna's garden. She really wants an irrigation system. -Saturday is her birthday. -What a good idea. Don't spend too much. Of course I'll give you a discount. Don't worry. Can you please pass me my employee? Thank you. Armando, she's supposed to be grieving and yet she begs for a discount. Sure, give her a discount, but give her a cheap coffin, only half-lined. -Can I come in? -Someone's at the door. -Hopefully my first customer here. -May I? -Please. -Thank you. Come in. Come in, please. I'm Professor Leccisi, I have the shop next door. -What a pleasure. Sit down. -So kind of you. -After you. -You have a very nice shop. It's modern, full of light, cozy… I wanted something cheerful, full of life! I want customers to be distracted and always be happy to come back. You know about business! I have been serving the elite of Rome for over 30 years. Aside from the pleasure of meeting you, I came for my Aunt. She deserves the best. Some Aunties must be treated like parents. Money should be no object. I'd like something relatively modest. You disappoint me. Such a wonderful woman surely deserves the best. -What do you mean? -Let's get her a nice box. That's more refined, fore sure. But how much would it be? No worries, I'll make you a nice neighbour discount. You're too kind. I'm new to this neighborhood, I must find new customers. I'll give you a hand. Everybody knows me here. Two hands are better than one, while digging a hole! -Isn't it, "while washing your face?" -If you sell soap. I coined my own idiom! Are four horses enough? No, that's too expensive. A hand one is enough for her. They can carry it by hand, but not all the way. I wouldn't advise a car for you, it's too fast. It just zooms past. People don't even have time to say goodbye to her. When you have horses, you can take a good walk. Not for your Auntie, but for those who come with her. It turns the whole thing into an occasion. People can chat. And she would get the respect of those who see it passing by with those four beautiful, powerful black horses. People stop, they wave and they cross themselves. Why should people do that when seeing my Aunt watering her garden? -I'm confused. Who will water the garden? -Aunt Giovanna. -The deceased's sister? -No, my Aunts are safe and sound. -What do you want then? -An irrigation system for the garden. -And why are you asking me? -You have the sign "Home" outside. -Did you read the rest? -Home… ware. Professor… Damn those guys! They went to lunch and forgot to put up the rest. -Do you know what's missing? -"Ware". Again? No, it's a "funeral home." That's what the box and the big black horses were for. You wanted to bury my aunt! -I bury the whole of Rome! -No! We are off to a bad start. You must leave! I don't want you next to my shop! -I don't want you here! -I don't have coffins or headstones. -What about that sign? -It's just a salon. People will read and cross the street. What will I sell? You will keep on working, people aren't superstitious anymore. And anyway, no one can say that it's something they don't need. Sooner or later, we all come here. Stop saying that! We'll be going to the restaurant, to the movie theater, to the park! Yes, sooner. But how about later? What a crazy guy. He got so upset that tomorrow his widow will come here! -What are you doing? -I'm practicing for the Christening. -I never held a baby. Have you? -Of course. Hold your arms out. Here's the baby. One thousand angels are singing And smiling from the sky A sweet song Caresses you like that A hand will softly guide you Among golden clouds Dreaming and watching over You, my sweet Protecting your steps Sleep, sleep Dream, my little love Sleep, dream Rest your head on my chest Close your eyes And listen to the little angels Sleep, sleep Dream, my little love Close your eyes And listen to the little angels Sleep, sleep Dream, my little love Amen. -The name? -Livia. Livia, receive the salt of knowledge, may it help you for your whole life. Amen. Peace be with you. -The name? -Giorgio. Giorgio, receive the salt of knowledge, may it help you for your whole life. Amen. Peace be with you. With this cross on your forehead be protected from devil. Through Christ our Lord. Amen. -Livia, do you want to be baptized? -I do. I baptize you in the name of the Father, of the Son and the Holy Spirit. Giorgio, do you want to be baptized? Yes, I do. Giorgio, I baptize you in the name of the Father, of the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Priest is using too much water, he'll give him a cold! Why did I come here if I can't talk? It felt so tender to hold that little bundle of joy! I know. He was so tiny I was afraid of breaking him just because I was breathing! -Are you happy? -We are godparents now, it feels odd. It must be wonderful to be parents. Actually, maybe it's time we think about it. I'm no longer a student. -We could have a baby. -I disagree with you. -What? Don't you want children? -Of course I want them. But what's the rush? We are young, we can enjoy life without worries. Are you trying to upset me? I bet you feel the opposite. No, Giorgio, I'm serious. I'm not ready to be a mother. Children bring responsibilities. I want to feel free. You shouldn't have married me, then. You'd be free! Now you're misunderstanding me. Let's talk about it another time. zLet's not talk about it at all. Well done, Giorgio. It's the silent ones you need to watch. You kept working away and then, all of a sudden, you leave for Kenya. I didn't have much hope, and yet… How long will you stay there, doing… your mining? I have a two years contract, but they might extend it. Two years go fast. And then you could come back here to help me. One day the factory will be yours and Livia's. Of course. -Does Livia know? -No, the letter just arrived. She will like it. New experiences. A new world, a new life. -I'm sure she'll like it. -I hope so. Think about your luggage, we don't have much time. -Giorgio, I'm not coming. -What? I don't want to go so far. But at first you were happy. I thought about it and changed my mind. The weather, the problems, people that I don't know. I would just bother you. I can understand why you want to stay here. The thought of living in a hut in the desert, under the sun! How could you be amongst people who work hard, sweating in the heat, without taking a nice bath every day? It's not for you. You stay here. Let me take you to the airport. No, thanks. I want to get used to being alone. -I won't insist, but we'll miss you. -Thank you. -Livia will come to you. -When and if she's ready. -Good luck and enjoy your job. -Thank you, goodbye. What's wrong? You can tell me everything. I'm your mother, I will understand you. Are you disappointed? Don't you love him anymore? Or maybe… is there's someone else in your life? -Professor… -Giorgio! What a nice surprise! -What are you doing here? -I came to say goodbye. -I'm leaving. -Where are you going? -To Kenya, I'll be running a mine. -Kenya? All of a sudden? I was waiting for that offer. That's the kind of work I love. Of course! And is Livia in the car? -No, Livia isn't coming. -What? You know, the weather, a new country… I can't blame her. She didn't want to come, did she? She is too young, too attached to her parents. Are you trying to convince me or yourself? Myself. Would you help me, Professor? Of course, if I can. There's something about Livia that I am missing. Something… or someone? I don't know, but… While I'm gone, could you… Are you asking me to spy on your wife? Yes. No… Maybe I can't find the words. What are you thinking about? You can leave with a light heart, Livia is an honest girl. I know that, but I can't see any other explanations. I'm not here as a jealous husband but as a loving husband. I need to know the truth. I would give her back her freedom right away just to see her happy. Count on me, then. I'll tell you the truth, whatever that is. Thank you, I knew it. This is my address. OK. Now go. Go and don't worry about a thing. -Good luck. -Thank you, Professor. I need it. I knew it, the funeral home is bad luck! These good luck charms are just enough for me, my friends are doomed. I need to hang up some lucky charms for Giorgio. He's definitely going to need them. Welcome to hell, engineer! I'm Rocky. Miner, driver, handyman, interpreter, and nurse. Nice to meet you. We've got to be quick. Your colleague can't wait to leave. -What? -He wants to leave. -Has he been here long? -Two years. -What do you think of the landscape? -I don't see much. Spot on. This is all you see, around here. I had pictured it differently. I don't know, prides of lions and a blinding sun. We have lots of lions. But you won't see the sun for two months. It's the rainy season. When it rains here, it rains more than everywhere else. You won't get bored, you won't have time. -We work day and night. -Take me back to the helicopter! Impossible. This is the boss' car, there's no reverse gear! -Alright, engineer? -Alright! I'm terrible with all the girls I leave them and then I take them back No one can resist me but I give up With one like you I often wonder If in order to follow you I'm losing My reputation of a terrible man I still don't know I'm very much convinced That I have to keep trying with you I don't want to admit That maybe you are more terrible than me I'm terrible with all the girls I leave them and then I take them back No one can resist me but I give up With one like you I'm very much convinced That I have to keep trying with you I don't want to admit Maybe you're more terrible than me I'm terrible with all the girls I leave them and then I take them back No one can resist me but I give up With one like you I'm terrible with all the girls I'm terrible with all the girls I'm terrible with all the girls I'm terrible with all the girls What do you think, engineer? For a mine this size, there is not enough equipment. The company should buy new tools. That's what I said two years ago. You try talking to the owners. See what they tell you. We absolutely must replace the rotten scaffoldings, fix the galleries and the housing and the plumbing. You'd be wasting your time. Last year I asked for some iron pipes to fix the wells. I'm still waiting. In any case, my assistant will fill you in on how things are run here. He's been living here for years. I feel like I was born in this mine. I see. I have noticed that the teams are segregated, all white men or all black men. We keep them separated to avoid promiscuity. -Do they sleep separately too? -We only separate them at work, for now. But try not to get upset, you're staying for two years. Now that I've passed everything on to you, I'm off. I'm very glad to leave this mine. -She came back at midnight again. -She went out for dinner. -She's not a little girl anymore. -One evening here, one there. She isn't a child anymore, but she's a married woman. Don't make a fuss. She's doing nothing wrong. I can tell, I just know. We can go to sleep, now. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. The dawn paints with the sun The world that was covered in blue I wake up To a new morning And the first thought of mine is you The first nightingale that sings The first cart that goes out A new morning Is born And I am born again with you You are also like a morning You paint the sun in my eyes Where you are not There's only night Where you are Love is born I walk by the church It's late and I won't be able to get in I realize that I'm praying on my own I thank that I have you with me You are also like a morning You paint the sun in my eyes Where you are not There's only night Where you are Love Is born -Do you want to hear something else? -No, thank you. Four records, for a total of 2,800 liras. Do you want a bag? -We have a record player in the car. -You'll use them right away. Thank you. Hold on, your change. Here. Thank you and goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye… Oh my God! The black widow! Please, come in. You've got to be strong. You know as they say, "Death goes on." -No, that's enough! -I meant, "Life goes on." Enough of this music! Son of a bitch! My husband's body is still warm… With this cold weather? I'm leaving! I feel like I'm disrespecting him, with this music in the background. As if I'm not being a good widow! I'm gonna go. Where are you going? You can't disappoint your husband, at least choose a coffin. With this music… I'll see if I can get them to stop. In the meantime, keep thinking about sad things like earthquakes, floods… About this guy who's going to be dead soon, after I get to him. I have a crying widow over there, do you get me? -Keep her for yourself! -That's what I'm trying to do! -This music is distracting her. -I put it on when I saw her. -Are you doing it on purpose? -No, I'm just being superstitious. Listen to me, we all have to make a living here. That's why I'm doing this! If you don't stop the music, I'll lose my sale. No, I must play it for my own business, in order to attract customers. Why don't you please some religious music, instead? No. You have to go! You must close down and move to another neighborhood. Right back at you! I can be superstitious too! Do you think you're immortal? Don't you think about your wife? Don't you want to make it easy for her? -Get out of here! Now! -I'm leaving. But be careful. I've destroyed families and armies. -All I need is a driving license. -Mind the horns! Are you afraid I break them? Mrs! Where are you going? Wait a second, please. Let me show you a kind of coffin that… -Go back inside! -Are you pushing me? Excuse me. -What are you doing? -My love, we must defend ourselves. I simply must, kitty cat. The gravedigger is just next door! My God, don't become obsessed! -He's needed too, you know. -Did you talk to him? No, I barely saw him. But he looks like a nice man. Don't be friendly with him. Today you greet him, tomorrow you talk to him and soon I'll be dead! You and your superstition! Think about taking care of us. -Has something happened to the kids? -They are fine. -They ate and now they're sleeping. -Good, then I can go out. Where are you going? Lunch will be ready soon. I have a meeting with the stockist about a new blender. Should I not go? -Go, but be quick. -I'll be quick. I'm going, I'll be right back. Bye. Bye, kitty cat. Electrical Appliances Leccisi. Livia, it's you! Fine, thank you. They are sleeping now. Yes, tell me. I see. -And Giorgio? -I got a letter from him. He's fine. Forgive me for being blunt, but you should tell him the truth. He should hear it from you. I can't. I'm not brave enough. Tell your mother, then. She will understand. Anyhow, you know what to do. As you wish, my dear. Of course. Thanks, I could count on you. Please don't tell your husband. Bye, see you soon. -Are you going out? -Yes. It's time to eat. Your father is coming back. You know he misses you at mealtimes. I know, I'm sorry. I can't postpone this. Bye. -Livia! -What is it? Nevermind. Things are getting messier. What are you doing? Were you spying on me? I wanted to see the new engineer. Well, you've seen me now. What do you think? I don't know. Give me a good look then. -You don't look like an engineer. -What do I look like? -Someone younger. -Like you? A little bit older. Do you know what I should do? Come. -What are you doing? -You're about to hit me. No! I'll give you cookies. What do you think of me now? Here you go. What about now? -You're nice. -Because I gave you money? Even without the money. What about the other engineer? What was he like? I saw him once by the window. -I was always hiding. -You know you can't stay here. -What's your name? -Johnny. And you? Giorgio. Come on, let's go back to your dad. Good morning, sir. -Is this your child? -Yes. Why did you get out? Sooner or later I'd have met him. I've keeping him in this hut for two years. What could I do? I lost my wife two years ago. We were left alone. Him more than me. I have to be both mum and dad to him. Everybody loves him around here. -They've helped me hide him. -Miners are very nice. Did you hear how well he can speak? This mine doubles up as a school! I understand, Rocky, you but there are rules here. My team's shift starts in half an hour. Do you want me to leave now or after my shift? The hell with the rules! Johnny, do you want to leave? No, new engineer Giorgio. You can stay with your father. We can stay, Johnny! Thank you. Thank you. No. I'm not liking Livia's behavior. I want to know what she's doing. Don't kick up a fuss. We always know where she goes, even if she comes back late at night. And what about the days? Where does she go? Who with? Nobody. But sometimes she doesn't come for lunch. Yes, once or twice. This happens every week! -I don't like this pattern. -Are you doubting our own daughter? I'm doing this for her. She should be with her husband. Instead, she stayed here. Why? Tell me. There must be a reason. I will find out his name and address. We are thinking of you and sending you all our love. Mum and Dad Ricard. Tilde, the kids, and I wish you a merry Christmas! Filippo Leccisi. I was wrong and maybe I'm still wrong, but I love you so much! Merry Christmas, Giorgio my love. Livia. -Come with me. -Where? Merry Christmas, engineer. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, Giorgio. Merry Christmas to all of you. To your families who are far away. Oh, happy day! Let me have the honor. Your invitation filled our hearts with joy. -Your glass. -Thank you. We are so very grateful. Sadly we don't have relatives in Rome. And no one should be alone on this day. Merry Christmas to everyone, near and far. My most affectionate greetings go to someone who is far away, but very much present in our hearts. Merry Christmas, Giorgio. I met my woman And I have understood That she is my woman Her skin is rosy She is 20 and has blue eyes She is so cute and has a little pug nose When I'm with her I'm full of joy I don't ever feel bored If i understand, she is my woman Yes, she is my woman Baby, I love you Baby, I love you Day and night I think of her Night and day I torment myself When I'm with her I feel like I'm someone else I don't talk to other girls I go crazy without her I always need to kiss her And listen to her I understand, she is my woman Yes, she is my woman Baby, I love you Baby, I love you Day and night, I think about her Night and day, I torment myself I love you. Baby, I love you I love you, I love you Merry Christmas everyone! Sit down now. Many of you know already know me, but not all. I have not met our new engineer. Drinks are on me! -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you too. We only ever spoke on the phone, finally today we meet, at Christmas. My wife. My friends. It's company tradition to wish merry Christmas to old and new friends. But we manage many mines, we can't be close to everyone. This year we picked the smallest and the least profitable one, but one that is still close to our heart. Mr. engineer, dear miners, Merry Christmas to you all. Merry Christmas! What is a child doing here? Who's son is he? He's my son. -Yours? -He was lost and I took him in. -He's like my own child. -If that's the case… It's not forbidden to you to bring your family alongside. Let's talk about gallery number 9. We must reopen it. Impossible. It's crumbling to pieces and it's simply not safe. But it's full of minerals. Mines either supply minerals or they close down. Alternatively, we can reduce the workforce. If you think that's needed, you can start firing me. Let's not even say that! We don't force anyone to go down that tunnel. There were always volunteers, am I right? There are always volunteers, you see? Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas Why? Why did you accept? I won't let you die in that mine! Thank you, but we'd be fired otherwise. And we'd die of starvation. We'd rather die working. Now you're hitting my car too? Don't park so close to me! A chariot with four horses would fit between our two cars! With you inside! You're a jinx! I'm gonna bury that man! PRIMAVERA INN May I? Is anyone here? Good morning. Good morning. How can I help you? I reserved a room with a view of the street. -You must be professor Leccisi. -Precisely. Come, I have a very nice room for you. -Street view? -Yes. The room faces the street, right in front of the hotel. Great, just what I wanted. How long will you stay? A week? Two? Oh, no. One or two hours I think. -You cannot stay here, then. -Why? We don't rent rooms by the hour. This is a respectable place! -No women are allowed here. -Don't worry, it's not like that. You can't play an instrument here. The other guests will complain. This isn't a musical instrument… Don't hurt us! -What do you think? -We know… -It isn't an instrument! -It's a rifle, like we see on TV! -You two are crazy! -Have mercy on us! It's a spyglass. I need it to see. I have the perfect view. Perfect. This is 10,000 liras for your trouble. You can go now. -Leave me alone. Come on, go. -Yes. Thank you! He spies into hotel rooms! Older men are the sleaziest! Livia! Who will tell Giorgio? He was right, poor boy! For the love of Saint Gennaro! Third floor. -Dad! -Livia! What are you doing? Who is in the bedroom? Doctor Schuller. Tilde! My wife! You're a mum to two twins and now you play doubles? Tilde! Yes, I remember. I was in Italy for a Gynaecology conference and she came to visit me. Please, sit down. She was worried because she couldn't get pregnant. It was such an interesting case. Since then, I have flown to Rome quite often. Now this young lady will be able to have a child and you'll become a grandparent! Why didn't you tell us? You could at least talk to your mum. She told me. She wanted to spare you the suffering. -Does Giorgio know? -No. He didn't want him to know. He wanted a child so badly. If I told him I couldn't get pregnant, that would have been the end of our marriage. Is this why you didn't go with him? Tilde! Tilde, what did you do? Sir… -Hello, Filippo. -Who are you? Me? Who are you! I'm an husband and a father. -I deserve an explanation. -Professor… Everything has been explained, kitty cat. -Please calm down. -Tell me the truth! I'm shaking. -Calm down and shut up. -I might calm down, but I can't shut up. What will I tell Giorgio? -Tell him he's the luckiest man on Earth. -Why? Go back to our hut and don't bother the engineer. -I don't bother him, we just play. -Alright, Johnny. But go there only if he calls you. Yes, Dad. Five men and a foreman, second shift, gallery number 9. -Have a good shift. -Thanks. -How is it going? -Same as usual. -How is it going in gallery n. 9? -It is what it is. We don't work happily down that darn place. I don't know how long will it hold. That's what the engineer says too. Why did you volunteer too? Because the engineer gave us such a bad look. And at the end of a well, our skin is the same color. Take care. No, we cannot go on. I won't risk my men's lives. They aren't yours or mine. They are just miners. When they go down there, they know the risks. No! You must keep gallery 9 open. But only with the local teams. European people have Embassies to protect them. Send another engineer then. This is the last time I send people down that gallery! -Who is down there? -Rocky and his team. This is the last shift. When they are back, close the gallery. Alright. -What are you doing? -Did you call me? Yes, I called you twice. Come in! Organize shifts for galleries 5 and 6 and keep in contact with the men in gallery 9. Yes, Sir. And you, don't get called twice again! -I bet you came here to play. -Yes. Well, then… Let's play. -Come on! -I'm falling! Rocky! There's a leak! Water? Everybody leave! -Dad! -Don't worry, wait here for me. -Number 9? -Yes. Gallery n. 9? Answer! Gallery n. 9! -We can't do anything. -Maybe the landslide broke a cable. Let's try from the ventilation pipes. Rocky! Gallery 9! Answer me! Gallery number 9! This is gallery 9. I hear you. Rocky, how are you? What about the others? Are you wounded? We are fine. Only Bogart is wounded, but it's nothing serious. -I'm going down there. -Yes. -You come with me. -Rocky. My assistant is coming down to check how big the damage is! -What can you tell me? -We dug into an aquifer. The exit is blocked. We are trapped 10 meters from the wall. Dad! Calm down, Johnny. Nothing happened. Johnny, don't cry. Daddy is alright! -I'm totally fine. -Come up, then! Right now I can't now. Later. -I'm coming down then. -Kids can't go in the mine. My dad is sick! -I'm fine, Johnny. -If you're fine, sing. When you're happy, you sing. Sing. Sing for your child. Rocky, answer! Simpson, Bogart! Answer! Put this back where it was! Check ventilation! Dad! -Another landslide! -I heard. Before this new landslide, there was a 30 meters obstruction. Even if we work day and night, it will take us two weeks to free them. -Are you saying they're doomed? -More or less. Gallery n. 12 is parallel to n. 9, we could get to them through that. Yes, but it's not reinforced, it could cause other landslides. There's no more air in the pipes. There must be a blockage. They won't be able to breathe. We must save them, no matter what. Sure, but in circumstances like this we need to ask for authorization. And to whom? The owner? I'm responsible for this mine! I order you to form a volunteer team. Alright. I'll be the first down. But we must tell the owner, we will need support. I'll call him. Alright, I'll send you gasoline and pipes. I'm warning you, though. Don't take any initiatives. You can only remove the debris. It's 30 meters deep. It would take two weeks to remove the debris! Then work as hard as you can and you'll see, two weeks will two become days, then two hours. I'm as upset as you are. But you can't destroy my mine for six black men. I'm in charge of this mine. You have no authority right now! No one is answering. We must be very far away. Can we start? No, let's wait for the engineer. He was talking to the owner. I fear that when he comes back he'll have changed his mind. -Why didn't you start? -I was waiting for your orders. I have already given you my orders! -It's late, go to sleep. -I'll stay here with the others. Good boy. Get a blanket and some warm milk. I fear… there's nothing left to do. You can use dynamite. Go get it. Where's my Dad? Why didn't you bring my dad back? He's down there with the others. I'm here for you. We need to have a talk. Come to my hut. We're using dynamite, to speed things up. She's the engineer's wife. Giorgio! Livia! My love… I waited for you. I waited every day that you'd come to me. But today I can't be happy. I know that this is a bad time for you. I heard what happened. But I'm here with you and I won't leave you again. I've been so sad. Me too. But let's not talk now. Let's do it everything is back to normal. Do you think that's even possible? Yes! We'll be happy and build a new life for us and our children. We already have one. His father was a friend of mine. Now he needs a mother. Do you want me as your mum? Engineer! It's a miracle! They are still alive! Dad! Daddy! It's nothing, Johnny. I'll be back soon. Just wait for me with the nice engineer. He won't leave you alone. Of course, Rocky. -He'll stay with us. -Thank you. Johnny, don't cry. Daddy doesn't want you to cry. He needs your smile to get better. On the 18th of November Of a year I don't remember Also a sparrow on a branch Left because he was afraid Then all of a sudden all became dark And his life ended The smiling guy They used to call him that The smiling guy won't ever smile again Our youth will have to live Without the sun The world of tomorrow will not have borders And a white hand will shake a black one My heart can break but just for love My heart can break but just for pity Hug me, brother, whoever you are If one day you'll be thirsty I'll give you my water My heart can break but just for love My heart can break but just for pity Hug me, brother, whoever you are If one day you'll be thirsty I'll give you my water On the 18th of November Of a year that's yet to come Even a sparrow on a branch Will be able to sunbathe THE END
