Barbara, not a word. I know he's there. The genius. And I do know what you're doing. I need to speak to him. Now. Immediately. Understood? Where would you be without the paper? Isn't it the paper, or me in fact, that gave you those assignments? Printed and published your crap. Looking after you for five years. And they give you a prize. And which one? The Daily paper prize. Who created that prize? The paper! And then suddenly you're a damn genius. Then you loose interest in the paper. Then you want leave. A leave? Do you think this is Danish public media? We run a paper! You're a fist fighting, horny, part time drinker just like the rest. - If you think you can have a leave... - I don't want a leave. Only regular employees get leaves. I am a freelance journalist. You're a devil. You're neither freelance or fully employed. You're fired, understood? From now on. You need to return the advance you picked up and get out! We have a paper to run here. Shit! You're pushing him. Are you completely broke? - I got that prize, you know. - 15,000. - And then IRS payed a visit. - And? - There's still some left for a vacation. - Two things I don't understand. - Just two? - Why do you absolutely have to go? This city is not the same without you. And, why are you going alone? I need someone to come home to. So long. By the way... Please get the sofa fixed. It's a racket. - Where are you going? - I don't know... - Greece, perhaps. - Don't you need a camera? - I already have a Nikon. Brand new. - I would go to Lesbos. - Obviously. - You don't have to be gay. Lets roll dice. Hello. So the paper let you go? - How do you know that? - We know everything here. - I had some insider info for you. - Well... What was it? They say, that something big is coming. Something big? What is something big? - You know... - Drugs? Hard drugs? - Yes, so they say. - Who says? Who has something big coming? Unbelievable. We all know it all. Except for the things that are really worth knowing. - You owe me 110. - Keep it in mind, Kurt. Write it down for next time. Be careful and you won't forget it. - You go to the airport? - What should I do there? They say you're leaving. I can give you a ride. No. I'm just going home. Come on, sweet children. Yes? Oh, it's you? Would you mind putting that out? It's not good for me. Thanks. It's about the first edition. Edgar Allan Poe. You remember, don't you? It just left with Mr. Rosenbaum. It was Rosenbaum. I forgot that name. - You promised to keep it for me. - That was nearly four months ago. I need to live as well. At least for a while. - Isn't Rosanbaum an old drug lord? - That was long ago. Others, much more powerful, have come. They don't come here. Don't even live in the neighborhood. - The Thin man. - They live in Gentofte, and such. I'm so sorry about that book. May I at least offer you a glass of port? Rosenbaum needed a present for friend. I have an exquisite, old wine. Almost as old as you. If I let it, it could be as old as me. But I don't. Please, sit down. Here we go. That's it. You're a writer. And a fine one if I may say so. What are you currently working on? - I have just been let go. - I see... I see... Cheers. - Is that wise? - Wise? Who? - What are you going to do now? - I don't know... travel, perhaps. Travel? I see. Go away? - Sometimes that's what you need. - Perhaps so. Once in a while it just gets too much. Violence... Death. And in addition serving it as lunch break entertainment. - It just gets too much sometimes. - Well... You're still young. - Hi... I didn't know... - Come on inside. - This is my niece, Hanne. - Hi, Hanne. We know each other. - Oh yes. - I'll be off again. - Sorry. - No problem. Wanna eat something? I'm making eggs. I'm off again. It wasn't important. Say hi to Ole. Tell him I'll be with him tonight. She is my sister's grandchild. They live in Vejle. I don't know why they let her move. They don't know the neighborhood. She needs to be taken care of. - I suppose Ole chef takes care of her. - Ole chef? Who is taking care of him, then? Would you like another glass? No, thank you, Bille. Let it age. - When are you going? - I don't know... I would like to go too... To Vejle. - Vejle? - You know, Hanne is from Vejle. It would do her good to come home to her family again. There is a small bar in Vejle. I'd like to buy it. If only I could raise the money. Are you ready? - God, what time is it? - 2:30. Shit, is it that late? We better... - Don't you want to listen to the tape? - No. Tomorrow is better. - I have to clean this place. - Do you have an appointment? - Who is that? - None of your business. - Where's the Colonel. - Sick. Let's go. We don't have all night. Come on then. Curiosity is unhealthy for you. Yes, of course. I just wanted... There is quite a lot in here. I usually get a... a sample. - Did you get anything? - Yes, right here. - That's fine. Give it to me. - Don't you want to go home first? No, come on. Give it to me. Come on. Morning. The new detective has arrived. And this just came from Heegaards Gade. Any coffee left? - Good morning... Ehlers. - Kaspersen. Welcome to Copenhagen. You arrived from Aarhus? Recently? - Last week. - Found a place to stay? In Broenshoej. At my sisters for now. - Sit down. Married? - Used to be. Thanks. What do you know about this neighborhood? Well, you pick up bits of information here and there. It's all true. We have more bars and nightclubs than anywhere else. More brothels, prostitutes and pushers than any precinct. Then, there's the regular people, shoppers, kindergartens, the retireds. - There is plenty to look after. - Yes, and we're heavily understaffed. Half of us is in bed with the flu. And then, this came in. The riot squad wants us on a raid tonight. They believe a load of drugs just arrived. The market has been undersupplied. Tag along and meet the neighborhood. - Thank you. - No problem. Welcome... That's a boy. Come on my children. - Let me give you a hand. - All right, pour a drink. Put on a record. I'll make us some lunch. - Do you want to sleep with me? - What? - I'll sleep with you. - I'm making us lunch. - Ole doesn't mind. - Please sit down and relax. You need something to eat. - Is it true you're leaving? - Yes, maybe. Perhaps we are too. Ole and me. Ole says he's making enough money for us to go to Vejle. That sounds good. Where are you going? - Greece, perhaps. - I've been there. Lovely. Very clean and such. - Ever been there? - No, but it sounds good. How long since you were in Greece? Cheers! - Taxi! - Take it ease, there. Is this the director? - Who's this? - This is Rosenbaum. - Director? - What do you want at this hour? Oh, it's the director. I recognize the voice. - You can also recognize it from a tape. - Tape? What tape? Why are you acting like a big shot, idiot? Have you got any more money? - Hey! Do you have more money? - Let's have some peace and quiet please. It's more than 4,000. It's the worlds best. - Has it a timer function? - Sure. Shit man, this is the top of the line. - If there is no timer... - Come on man, you'll get it for 1,200. - Let's roll a die. - You still owe me, man. Add it, write it down, for Christ's sake. Don't ever forget to keep accounts. We have some visitors. - Visitors! - Shit. You owe me damn it... Police! Please keep quiet. Hands above the table. Hands above the table, please. That's enough. Get him out. Kaspersen... This is too much. You can't even go to the toilet anymore. - This way, madam. - Oh, please. Ah, look what we have here? Kaspersen, please let me introduce one of the neighborhood attractions. This bright, young genius, here. Denmark's hope. A brawler and drunk. Journalist, prize winner... Know why he won? A series of articles about police incompetence at Vesterbro. He serves naked women, blood, violence and social misery... As lunch break entertainment. No, what have we here? Nice, a brand new camera. Where did we buy that? Do we have a receipt? An invoice? No, perhaps not here. Bring it to the station. We'll take care of the camera until then. We'd hate for something to happen to it. He's okay. We're closing now. What is this shit? I didn't do anything wrong. It's Bob. We just had visitors. I noticed they took Hanne. Yes, he's here. Ole chef wants a word with you. - He wants to know if you'll drop by? - I'm too tired. He says he's broiling a steak. Sounds like shit! I'm too hammered. Why don't we listen to that tape? It's terrific. - Where is the tape? - I don't have it here. Stop doing that! I need to tell you something about the tape. I'll make crisp onions, right? You don't like the soft ones. - I absolutely hate soft onion rings. - You're an odd bugger. Everyone loves soft onion rings. I'll just fry them a bit. You see, the other day, when we were finished playing, and you'd gone... They came to pick up the goods. Someone was here I didn't recognize. The others said he was here, because the regular guy had the flu. He didn't say much. The others were scared shitless. When they were gone, I noticed, that the tape recorder was rolling. It had recorded everything. I didn't know what to do. But then Rosenbaum came by, and he knows the business inside out. I played the tape for him, and he said it was the Thin man. He was absolutely certain. He was dying to hold on to that tape. It was obvious to Rosenbaum, but I kept the tape. It has to be worth something. No one was ever able to prove anything against the Thin man. It has to be worth something. The police doesn't pay anything for that sort of thing. I'm afraid to call the Thin man. Rosenbaum told me he would pay. It's just not me, I'm simply too scared. But that's pretty damn interesting... I suppose there is a good story in it, right? Obviously they'll arrest me. But I'll get out sooner or later. And then we could go to Vejle. Right? How does that sound? What the hell, are you sleeping? Are you sleeping? I must have dozed off. - What is that? - It's a steak with onions. I can't stomach those soft onions... It's not bloody soft onions. They're crisp. I need some fresh air. Those bloody Greeks. Mixing various drinks. I walking sideways. I'll be back tomorrow. We'll play then. I'm sorry about the steaks. Don't worry about the steaks. When he realized what was going to happen, he got scared. He looked at me. I'll never forget his eyes. That's why I'm coming. I always see those eyes. Frandsen, you need to listen to me. Then, I forced his head backwards and cut his throat. It's best that way. That way there are no sounds from the throat. - In the Resistance we were taught that. - Yes? But there was an awful lot of blood. An awful lot. - Frandsen, you need to listen to me. - Absalonsgade 15 B, 3rd floor. - By these hands... - And what was the name? Rosenbaum, I got that one. But what is your name? That's good. We'll be there. Please don't touch anything. Come on, Simonsen. It's the same each month. The same confession... Why don't you come up with a new story? We have a report of a homicide in Absalonsgade. It's Fritz Rosenbaum. Old drug lord. In that sort of case where Ehlers wants to be woken. - Yes? - It's me. Can we talk about it? Half the staff's got the flu. There are two homicides near your place. - Both Borch and Georg is down. - Well... All right. I accept, you're freelance. I'm giving you double time. This is a great story. You wouldn't let the paper down, would you? I already sent a photographer. Come on... Good morning. Christ. That was no goddamn photographer. That was the police. Fuck me. Shit! - It's 7:42, and you're under arrest. - For what exactly? We need to question you further regarding the circumstances of a homicide. Murder? Me? It was committed between 1 and 2 tonight. - On who? - You need to follow us. The only encouraging thing about this dirty is affair meeting your classy ass. Fuck you and give me an explanation. No stupid jokes. Okay, your fingerprints were all over the place. You forgot your saxophone. And when we ran into you earlier in the evening you didn't seem sensible. - What are you talking about? - Cafe Freden. So what? Ole Wilhelm Jensen was murdered last night at Cafe Freden. - Ole chef? - Yes, Ole chef. Ehlers. I supposed that's right. You realize he's on an important job for the paper. We can't just sit around. - As long as you know what you're doing. - We are interrogating suspects. Suspects? Give me a break. I've called National Court Attorney Jan Berentsen. If you want to waste his time, go ahead. But right now you're wasting mine. Bring the genius for a report. Do it thoroughly and by the book. POLICE ON THE LOOSE AGAIN I already explained that to you. Let's take it one more time. Perhaps you'll remember something new. You were quite drunk. We saw that ourselves. Not in my wildest dream would I kill Ole. He was my friend. We were best friends. Why would I want to kill him? Idiot. You also knew Ole Wilhelm Jensen's partner. Hanne Margrethe Jespersen. She's an addict and a prostitute. How intimate do you know her? Perhaps Ole chef was dissatisfied that you and her... Come on, guys. You don't understand a damn thing. We believe that Ole Wilhelm Jensen was pushing drugs. - And that he had access to... - Excuse me for a second. This is ridiculous. You assume. You believe... Bullshit! You shouldn't assume or believe a damn thing! You know as well as I do. We all know... Who does that sort of business around here. The thin man, right? He has the perfect setup, as long as the police keeps wasting time like this! It's the ink. Excuse me for a second. It's a VCR and a stereo. I just need to ask. Did they vandalize anything? - They went down... - Besides that? Goodbye. Go home and sleep. Sometimes things get a little out of hand. - I never realized... - Imagine the boldness. But he's not getting away with it. You two find him. He's either in the neighborhood or at the paper. - Attorney Jan Berentsen. - Just let him in. It'll be a pleasure. Shall we drive to his apartment? No. He's not that stupid. - Who gets there first? - I do. - HS-HS, reporting. 010, over. - 010, come in. We have identified the suspect in Istedgade just outside number 13. We'll pursue and attempt arrest. 010, over. 010, copy, out. HS-HS, the suspect escaped via the backyard to Istedgade 14... And we need backup. - 010, 011 and 012 are coming. - Copy. 010, over. - HS, reporting. 6501, over. - Come in. We have identified the suspect. We'll pursue and attempt arrest. Nah, we haven't seen him the last couple of days. He's probably left. Wasn't he on vacation? - Oh, yeah. He's left. - Wasn't it something about Greece? Yes, he was going to Lesbos. - Lesbos is a terrific place. - That's enough. Well, if you write him don't forget to say hi. That's it. Take that home. - I hope it's fine. - It's brand new. - Is there a warranty? - What do you think this is? - I ought to have a warranty. - It's less than half retail price. - But what if something is broken? - Not my problem is it? - Jesus. - Easy, easy. - What do you want? - I need a place to stay. - Not with me you're not. - It's dangerous. The whole neighborhood is looking for you. They say the Thin man wants you, and the police. If I were you, I would go to Greece as fast as possible. I'm off. See you. - Okay, just tell me one thing. - What? - Where does the Thin man live? - What do you want him for? - I need a word with him. - You're not well, man. No. We haven't seen the Thin man, but a taxi just arrived. Somebody came out carrying two suitcases. It's the Colonel. His Jaguar is in the driveway. And here comes the Mrs. with the child. They entered the taxi. The Colonel stayed behind. The taxi's leaving. The Colonel walked back to the house. We'll stay put and continue the surveillance. It's the same every time something is about to happen. Only God knows how that man looks inside. Every time it's about murder and violence he sends the Mrs. to the country. Perhaps she doesn't even know what he is doing. Under no circumstances is this happening in Gentofte. Call them back. - Hey. Got some sleep? - Yes, thank you. - We still haven't apprehended him. - He's a handful. I was thinking... I seriously doubt that he's the killer. I don't care. Just find the man. Find him, dead or alive. Find him! - Where were you? - Nowhere, really. It's tired. - When are you going home? - In an hour. Is that okay? What? A shaver? Well, I suppose I can fix that. Just one more thing. Can you find out where the Thin man lives? He lives in Gentofte. He's not in the phonebook. They have to know something in the crime department. Bille! What's going on? Let me help you. What the hell were you thinking? - I'm deeply sorry. - You're not hurt are you? So kind of you. It's the right leg. It's seen better days. - What are you doing out here? - Looking for Hanne. She was arrested last night. She's at the station. She was released this morning. This morning? Those guys, that murdered Ole chef are tearing the town apart looking for her. - They're looking for you too. - It dawned on me. - Please let me take you home. - Thank you. - Does it hurt? - It's torn. The doctor says I have to live with it. And I suppose one has to until it kills you. Oh, that's the cognac. For a second I thought it was the port. It's aging, remember? Where is Hanne? I don't know. Hiding. She has a friend... Gurli. Perhaps she's with her. - I wonder if we'd find her there. - Yes, maybe. I don't know where she lives. She's hangs around the oriental bar. - I guess you could ask them. - Yes, maybe. Yes, maybe. Let me show you. Look, take this. I've taken good care of it, and it works. And in your current situation, it might come handy. Do you know how to use it? - Where's the other one? - I keep it in my coat. You're surprised. Of course. I sometimes ask myself how it all ended like this. I could never hurt a fly. I've lived here my entire life. These children were never God's finest. But they were living here. This was a refugee. Unfortunately the Thin man unofficially crowned himself king of the neighborhood... He doesn't even live here. He and his gang fill the neighborhood with evil, fear, violence and death. The police are useless. Suddenly, an old man walks about with a loaded gun. And there's a price tag on a poor girl from Vejle. This is literally killing her! Is Gurli around? Don't know her, sorry. - Gurli from Vejle. - Oh, that Gurli. - She's not in yet. - Do you have her address? Let me check. - What the hell? - I just need a little word. - Who were you calling? - That's none of your business. Let's have some music... Now, let's talk. What did you say to me again? Why didn't you just say so? What the hell... - Vesterbrogade 60 C. - Where have you been? - They are coming for you. - Everybody. Have you heard about Topcat? - It's a porn club, right? - Why are you going there? Just an address I was given by a man in a bar. It's not a good place. - It's the Colonel's place. - The Colonel? The Thin man's right hand. It's not a good place. Stay out of there. Let's see... It should be here. - From your country? - Very popular. Don't get started, now. It should be here. - What was her name, again? - Gurli. Oh, Gurli? She lives there. Gurli lives there. - Who is it? - Is it Gurli? - Who's asking? - I have a message for Hanne. You're the reporter, right? She's been out of her mind. So I got her a fix. She's calm now. I have to go. I don't want them to get mad at me. - She's scared and wants to go home. - Okay... Hanne? Hanne? Come on, you're going home. Listen, Hanne. I'm putting you on a train to Vejle. - Everything is going to be fine. - Ole said the same thing. By the way... Here. - What is it? - The tape I was supposed to give you. Ole told me it was very important. - That was beautiful. - You can keep it. - Do you want me to go inside? - Just wait for me. Copenhagen Central Station. Intercity train for Aarhus leaves at 8 pm, track 5. The train stops at Roskilde, Korsoer, Odense, Fredericia and Vejle. Do you want me to call anybody to tell them you're coming? I'll do that myself. I want to tell them myself. Safe journey. - Thanks. - So long. Intercity train for Aarhus, 8 pm, leaves in a few minutes. Intercity train for Aarhus, 8 pm, leaves track 5 in a few minutes. I'm busy. I'm waiting for a customer. Who? Shut that shit off. - Where did he go? - Who? - Your customer, damn it. - I don't know. - Go for a ride. - No, I'm waiting. Just drive, you little Turk shit. - Well... - Exactly. Hey you... I don't want any trouble. - They're looking for you. - I just need to borrow the phone. Not at my place. They came here for Ahmed as well. They beat him to a pulp in Sydhavnen. Open up. - I need a drink. - We're closed. Asshole. What's this? My God, it's you. - What are you doing here? - I live here. What are you doing here? - You live here? - 1st floor to the left. - Do you know anything about that place? - What do you want to know? What are they doing. What does that Colonel do? Don't you want to come up. You look like you need a little peace. Well, can I borrow your phone? I don't want to involve you in this. Lots of people come here all the time. - How about a bath? - Yeah, just the phone please. It doesn't matter, I didn't expect anything. I just boiled some water for some eggs. You know just in case, right? And I probably had one drink too many. But I'll survive, I guess. Things just keep happening. Maybe, if it's not too late. - That's fine by me. See you. - Bye. Where are you? If something is seriously wrong you'd tell me, right? - Yes. - You'd call me, right? I'll call you, I promise. - See you... And thanks. - No worries. Bye. The Thin man... I almost forgot. He lives at Soevaenget 14. It's in Gentofte. That's all. Bye, bye. Yes, that's him. I thought so. Come and have a look. Come, look. He's Swedish. Quite pretty. The car's not bad either. He comes once in a while. And then something's going on. It never fails. - So what's going on? - What do you think? Every time you can't score... They're dying, poor creatures. They're feeling terrible. Whenever there is a delivery he's back again. - The Swedish guy. - A courier? I don't know what's going on at Topcat. Nothing unusual they say. Just the regular in out. Perhaps a little slap in the behind. - Not my style. - Is it the Colonel's? I think he represents the owners. They own the whole building. - Soon they'll own the entire street. - The Thin man? I don't know anything about that. Nothing at all. I only know the view from my window. And according to your view, something is going on at Topcat. I think it's the apartment upstairs. - Can you do me a favor? - You want that bath after all? Maybe later. I'm going to see what they're doing. You mind calling the police? - No. - No? I'll do anything, but call the police. It's a principle. No matter what, I never call the police. Listen, they're dying to get me... You don't have to say your name. Just tell them you watched me enter Topcat. That's all you have to do. - Are you sure you're going in there? - Positive. It's not fair. I wouldn't mind if the police got here 5 minutes after I go in. I see... Topcat, Absalonsgade. And you're certain about it? What was your name again? Oh, Kaj, is it you? No, of course not. Could you please come over? I could really use some moral support. Yes, as quickly as possible. I think you took a wrong turn. It's down there. Thanks. - What the hell? - Hands in the air! Back against the wall! Come on! - What is all this? - That's right. Don't try anything or I'll shoot. You murdered Ole chef. Never heard of the man. I won't hesitate... I'll shoot! But if you keep calm for a few minutes, the police will be here. - Anonymous you say? - Yes, he hung up. A lot of people are interested in him. Editor Otzen also keeps calling. It can't be him... The lab determined that, Ole chef was killed by the same gun that killed Rosenbaum. When Rosenbaum was shot he was at a bar, hammered. - I saw it myself. - Ehlers wants him badly. Still, let's wait for Ehlers to come. If he's at a nightclub he's not going anywhere. - How long is this taking? - Hands behind your neck! What do you do now? Wait? Why aren't you doing anything? Will you let him get away with this? You have someone who'll fix this, right? How do you run this shit organization? So Danish... So fucking typically Danish! How weak... You're just a pack of... Amateurs! Shut up! No, No, No... Forget that. I'm not keeping quiet. If the police arrive I have a lot to say about you and your organization... And your damn boss. - That's enough. - Keep those hands up and shut up! Do it yourself! What sort of an antique gun is that anyway? Does it even work? No! That's enough! Get him up and wait for me. We need him to talk. Hey... He's a real cowboy. Did you see his revolver? The water... it's warm. Let's give him a cold shower. - Jesus. Is it you? - Didn't you call the police? - I called. I promise. - Call again. Close the door and call again. You look awful. You're bleeding.... Are you hurt? Everything is fine, just call the damn cops. Well, I don't know... What the hell is it with you and the police? - I'm off. - No, Kaj. Please don't. I'm gone. Call. I just called... Why didn't you come? - Let me talk to Ehlers. - Who is this? - Chief Ehlers is not here right now. - Come on! Where is he? Who's at the station then? Nobody? That's impossible! Take it easy! It's me! It's me! Otzen? Jesus... The police? - Come on, damn it. - Yes, yes. Get to work! Barbara was afraid something happened. Are you hurt? You're bleeding, you got to get to a hospital. I told you nothing happened! - Can I take him to the hospital? - Of course, we'll go immediately. Hold on a second, I'll take that. Go home and sleep, we can discuss this later. Half of them are still in bed. Barbara is cleaning your apartment. She told me she has a key. - She was saying hi. - Fine, thanks. - Just a moment, please. - He needs to go home and sleep. I have to take him to the station first. We need some information. - Is that really necessary? - Don't worry. It's okay. - Then you'll take him home later? - I'll see to it. Otzen? I want you to back to Bent. - And pay for the damages. - What? You heard me. You got some great shots. - That's worth a lot, right? - True. - Can I count on you? - Of course. - I'll be seeing you. - Yes, bye. There's no doubt about it. Those two we got... They killed Ole chef and Rosenbaum. The gun matches. I had them. I was sitting with them. Both the Colonel... And a Swedish guy. A whole suitcase full of drugs. I had them. - If only you showed up. - I wish you'd stay out of police business! It's completely hopeless! It's impossible to do our jobs when you constantly mess around. I'm sorry. All the drugs were gone when we arrived. Even the dogs didn't find anything. Radio news, this is Thursday, March 14th. A girl was discovered dead in a train between Fredericia and Vejle. The girl was a junkie and was found in the bathroom. She had a lethal dose of heroin. The police are withholding her identity. Hanne. Yes, that's right. Hanne Margrethe Jespersen. I'm sorry. You knew her well, didn't you? She was dating Ole. It was me who put her on that train. Was she carrying any drugs? Quite the opposite. She wasn't feeling well. - I shouldn't have left her. - Someone gave it to her on that train. Just a couple of things. It won't take long. - The Chief is on the wire. - Oh, so he's up early too. Just a moment. I didn't quite get that. Would you mind repeating? Well, let's get this thing over with... - Oh, it's you. - Bille? I am so happy to see you. - What happened? - Happened? Nothing complicated... I shot him. - You shot him? - The Thin man, yes. One shot was sufficient. He in there, on a Persian rug. - Jesus! - Yes. I am very happy to see you. Would you mind following me home? Not at all. You better close the door. The train is far. Do you want me to call a taxi? No, that's not necessary. I can walk. I can walk now. Hardly any pain in my leg. - That's nice. - Isn't it odd? It's a strange feeling killing someone. Taking a life. It cleanses your body and soul. Is that spring I feel in the air? - Would you do me another favor? - Of course. Would you please deliver this to the police? - It's a confession. - A confession? In detail. It's not necessary. Nobody will suspect you. Yes, it's necessary. They must know it was me. That one of the old timers from the neighborhood did it. - Maybe this place can be better. - Well... All the books? It pains my right leg again, reminding me that I'm an old man. Soon I won't be able to mount the ladder. Now, let's drink our port. Listen, I won't say a word. Are you certain... Let's have another port. - And you will do me that favor? - Okay. At first I was going to mail it. But now I'm happy they'll receive it sooner. Officially, I can't support this. But between us I respect the old man. Which reminds me... Where were you going with that revolver? This is Bille's... He had a pair. He has the other one. And it's loaded? I better get you home and in bed before you escape again. - By the way, did you read it? - What? "When you receive this I will be dead, I am taking my own life and nobody should be sad. I did my duty, and lived long enough. Respectfully, Bille." It's no use putting you to bed. But the weather's fine. I can buy you a beer. - How do you feel? - Might as well go on that vacation. - Hey. - Ahmed. I drove you around. How much do I owe you? You owe me 300. Just kidding. You need to come listen to that tape. - Where's the Colonel? - Sick. Let's do it then, we don't have all night. Come on then. Curiosity is unhealthy for you. That is the Thin man. There's no doubt about it. He was there in person. I'll be damned. So that's why Ole was crazy about that tape. - Would you have been able to arrest him? - Maybe. Always depends on the judge. Thin man had some... demonic lawyers. If I wasn't so drunk and preoccupied with myself that night... - If I hadn't fallen asleep... - I said maybe. There are no guaranties. An old book keeper already took care of it. Do you need a ride? No, I want to walk. Somebody should write that story...
