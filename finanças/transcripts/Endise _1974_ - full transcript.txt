Anxiety Dirty bastard, trying to save his life to make us kill this little child. - He is playing with us. - God knows. I'll kill him one day. Cevher has no heart at all. He threw this child to us. He offered 10,000 liras to me, if he makes it 15,000 then I will forget about this blood feud What a shame. Will you forget our feud if someone offers you money? There are peacemakers whom I cant object. Shall I say no to them. I swear, my own life is nothing. I only pity for those innocent little ones. If I die or go to jail, who will take care of my children. I am sure, they will starve to death. Not a single soul will give them a piece of bread. It is Kara Haso's turn. I am tired of waiting for the grim reaper every day. Stop it. Dont give up your hopes. We have important peacemakers. We have agreed upon the amount of blood money. For all my life, I've never seen 15,000 lira in my pocket. Where can I find, how can I find 15,000 liras. 15,000 liras. I even cant imagine it. - If we cant save that much money... - Dont worry, whole family will work hard. All of us will work hard in cotton fields. If it's not enough, we will sell your gun. Shame on you, one will never sell his gun. You're gone out of your mind? When the blood feud ends, you wont need your gun anymore. Other alternatives? No. I am helpless. We have to save 15,000 liras in 45 days. And we are all broke. I was dreaming about the money I would save in cotton fields to spend it in winter times... But now we run into this trouble. What will we do in winter time. Whole family will starve in winter. They will starve to death.

They are working so hard. - Play a card my landlord. - What are you talking about It will start raining soon. It will be too bad for us. Tell them to start a new cotton field tomorrow. Silo, what does the papers tell about cotton prices. Nothing. It writes about Cyprus conflict I am waiting for cotton prices. The rest doesnt interest me at all. No news for you. You know him, the foreman, he is a real man. Yes right, what does he order. Go on... tell me... He wants your daughter Beyaz for his housekeeping. He says, he will pay her the top daily fee. But... So, she'll be comfortable, she wont be working in the fields under the sun. Dont you know we dont have such a tradition. She is our honor. What will she do in a stranger's house. Is this a new custom. This is not for us. [i]...Radio playing prayers in Arabic language...[/i] I already have enough trouble And they want her as a servant Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch. Dont they know our customs. You too... hurry up, dont be so slow. Cevher, whats up? Mind your own business. Whats up, what happened? Dont they know us a little we are not servants What does this foreman thinks He thinks my daughter will be his servant in his house Shall we rent her honour to him. Shall we obey him because we are involved in debt. - Does he try to touch our honor - How come, is he crazy I said no to him Yes you will say no to him. Cinema is here New films are here for you Lets put it here Let me watch it first C'mon the new film is starting Tarzan jumping over trees Dont you have a porno film Get lost you idiot. In which field you are talking about Some workers gathered at agha's land demanding... ...for their rights - How come, I dont understand They are demanding their rights. - They are making demonstrations - Their rights? What is that? Their hourly wages. They want it to be fixed at 1 lira. Yes over there. Did they declare labour wages there? Not yet. There is a rumour, it will be 1 lira they say. You know our coalition government is collapsing. - Do you know your wages? - No, we dont know. But it is supposed to be declared to you, isnt it. Are you hungry Cevher? No my friend I am not hungry. But I want to smoke badly. May God find it acceptable your generosity. - Talk about it tonight - I will... I am looking for a proper time What do you mean... Tell him thats all... You know too... this is a sensitive matter. Yes sure I know it very well - You'll get your money. - Yes I know Dont talk too much you'll get your share. I dont mean it. I trust you boss. [i]...prayers in Arabic...[/i] [i]...its time to break their fast...[/i] [i]...preaching a sermon on the radio...[/i] When I finish with cotton fields... Will you go back to Urfa? Yes - Hello Cevher - Hello Is it good news? Yes Come with me. - Things are changed. - How? - The foreman wants to get married to your daughter. - What do you say - He will pay bride's bonnet money He is a stranger, he doesnt belong to our nomad group. Forget it Cevher, it is not important at all. Think about it once more. He will pay a good price. You'll improve your life standarts. I am confused, what shall I do. Dont think twice say yes to him. He will pay bride price honorably. What happened What does he want - Listen carefully. - I will, I will... You know, the foreman, he is a good man. Eh? so what? He wants to get married to Beyaz Oh no, but he is an oldie. Yes I know it. I have guilty conscience But are there any other solutions. He is not one of us. He is an outsider. We will fall into disgrace What about Sehmuz then, he sold his daughter to the city the price was 1000 liras per his daughters kilogram weight which one of us have blamed Sehmuz doing so? Look Ramo, take it like this, Beyaz will get married sooner or later. We havent got time to think it over. You know how helpless we are. She is your daughter you will decide. I will ask for more than the current price in our village She will save our winter expenses. We will pay up our debt to put an end to this blood feud. - What is your answer Cevher? C'mon say it. How much the foreman offers? I will tell you what is in his mind. He is willing to pay 15,000 liras. Are you trying to make me crazy. Dont you know that... lowest price in our village is 30,000 for a bride like her Do you buy in a bride or a sacrificial animal? - None of your business. - 15,000 eh?... Get lost. - As you like... I dont care... I will never say yes if it is less than 30,000 Bastards - Why stopped? - I worry about your brother... he will cause bad things to happen jinns will punish us he is so greedy Dont worry he can handle it. He is eating his heart out. All he thinks is cotton prices. All he thinks is money I am afraid I'll be a widow soon. God save us. - It is right... - What does it say... Does it come from the government? If we buy two mellons no money will be left for us I dont know, they say the government hasnt declared... the cotton prices yet. I dont know. I dont know - Whats up? Do you know anything about agricultural section of the law? Do you know anything about agricultural worker rights? No, I dont know. How will we defend our own rights? - Cotton prices are fixed to 2.5 liras. - No you're joking, it is 0.6 liras. You, son of a bitch.

Tell me now, am I unfair to you. I hear, some union representatives are coming to you They are wasting your time If you dont work at cotton filds do you think they will pay you Do they know better than the government I am your boss. Whenever you have a problem... ...come directly to me. I am the one to solve your troubles. The government hasnt declared the cotton prices yet... ...but I will solve your money problems... Dont trust those strangers. Never think of calling a strike. Finish your work at cotton fields as soon as possible. Then I will pay you more than you imagine. Now lets eat our deserts to put a sweet end to it. Cemal 150, Suayip 100, Cevher 300, Ali 150 [i]...poster of social democrat prime minister Ecevit of 70's...[/i] [i]...signboard of trade union building of agricultural workers...[/i] Come here, c'mon watch my movies draw a lesson from my movies Today is holiday It is time to watch films. Look at western civilisations. Laurel Hardy Gene Autry - Any good news? - No all same as before. - What will you do then? - The foreman knows the best Stop it child be patient you all will watch it - What will you do now - I dont know Get out of here, you dishonoured creature You humiliate our family You are dishonouring all of us. Do you think you are carrying on a love affair Stop it Cevher. Forgive her. - Release me - Hold yourself back. You'll kill her In these troubled days she will make me kill her. Enough of it. Hold in your temper. Deadline is coming and we dont have the money yet Is it the girls fault? The foreman doesnt increase the bride price In these hard days shall we lose our honour too She was smiling at that boy. Nonsense. You wont be dishonoured when she smiles at a boy. If we support each other we will overcome everything. Dont be upset so easily. We have spent weeks working at cotton fields. How much... ...money we will make. Nothing. Maybe this time they will pay high prices. I dont believe it. We are losers. We will lose our blood we will lose our women Lets check our notes once again. How many... ...kilograms of cotton we have made. You've got your troubles, I've got mine... The city... The factory... Thank you. Good old days. When my father was the boss, those workers... were afraid to talk to us. But now... some union delegates are coming to fields to talk to... ...laborers. You were away for some time. You dont know how it changed. Be careful. They are conservative. - What do you mean by that. - I didnt understand As if they were living in a tin can. If you open it, you cant guess their behaviour. The minimum price hasnt declared yet. There is a rumour, workers will ask for... ... 1 lira. If the government will pay us 10 liras per kilogram, then we will pay them 1 lira... In fact, representatives muddle things up, to raise their fee. But my friend, such people drive me crazy You know I am a humanist at heart... ...I try to protect them by food aids, health benefits, I always do my best. But it is impossible to make up to those laborers. They know nothing about humanism. Stop it. Dont fool us with humanism tales because you studied at Germany. Do you believe that the boss will pay us more, if the government... ...will declare a high price for cotton. - I swear he wont. OK then what will we do to make it 1 lira per kilogram We will stop working and we will organize demonstrations. We want to talk to Agha. - They want to talk to you. - I have nothing to talk to them. - Did you hear? - I only know the representative I do my best, but they dont agree. They want to sign an agreement. Osman, you talk to them. I dont want to meet them in person. You dont understand. Agha himself doesnt know how much he will earn To whom he will sign a contract, who are you. When it will be declared then you'll get 10%. And the representative will get his 10% share. Every year it was just like this. Do you try to change it now? Tell me representative. Dont you agree? You're right. But they dont listen to me We want to know the exact amount or else we will stop working. Never less than 1 lira per kilogram. What do you say. If it rains everything will be wasted. Then who will compensate for Agha's loss. Will you? Look at them. Do they think that I will beg them to help me. Its over. No contract or agreement. I dont want them to work for me. Where is the representative. Tell him to come to me. - What is your decision? - They wont agree if it is less than 1 lira. Well, I see, this is a strike. OK, then you'll bear the consequences Alright. Wont you load the gathered cotton on the truck. Oh my landlord, I do whistle but none of them obey me. Here. Look. OK you are on strike. But everything must be in order. At least make them load the gathered cotton to the trucks. If you dont load it to trucks till noon, then I know what to do. This story will not end like this. If the cotton wont be loaded... ...to trucks then I will send the representative to prison. Think it over. Your strike is illegal. You know we are under martial laws. I order them to work but they say here they are... ...spending their holidays enjoying themselves. They say... ...no one can force them to work. Listen representative, if it wont be loaded to trucks today... ...then it will be too bad for you. - 5 days, the foreman, labour wages, they are on strike, I have 5 more days... Remo, come. Remo, I am not on strike, I will work tomorrow. You must understand me. Nobody can stop me. It will be an unseemly manner when everybody were on strike They dont know how I need the money. I am desperate. Shall I give my daughter away for nothing Its good to belong the majority. Maybe they will solve blood feud too. They will come for blood money soon. Listen to me. Come join us. We will be stronger together. Nobody has understanding. Even you left me alone. It was you who would protect me. Tomorrow you should work with me. No way. I wont back out of my promise. Leaving us alone? Wont you defend the blood of your family . Damn you. You dont deserve my sister. - What happened? - Your brother is a strike breaker. We wont be working till the boss accepts our terms - Dont put us at risk Ramazan. - No danger if we stand all together. - Cevher told me: "you dont deserve my sister" - Do you think so? - No, never, why... - Mind your own business - How many years you've been working with me? - 6 years - OK then have I ever meant to harm you? - No, never - OK then what is this strike problem - I do my best my landlord. - We dont know the cotton... ...prices yet. How can we pay you 1 lira per kilogram. - You're right my landlord, but I whistle all the time but they dont move at all. OK tell me, if I pay them 1 lira what will be your share? - You already know it... - Come here, lets talk about it in details...

You the smart arse, after studying in Germany you turn into a scientist? In the old days, when our fathers were ruling those fields, the workers... ...were afraid of looking into our eyes. But now they claim for their rights. Rights... declarations... demonstrations... They think they are a member of society. - As if they are... - Did you say something - Did you say something - No my boss - We should behave justly or mercifully towards workers - Almost all of them have guns - We should be cautious... - Any news? - Its getting worse - They dont listen to me at all. Only Cevher is working. - If it starts raining... - Take my word, you'd better pay extra fee to Cevher.
