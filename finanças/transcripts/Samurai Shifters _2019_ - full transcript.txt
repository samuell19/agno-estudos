The year is 1682, in the era of the fifth shogun, Tsunayoshi Tokugawa. "Himeji" This story took place nearly 350 years ago. "Naonori Mastsudaira Lord of the Himeiji Domain" Naonori Matsudaira Lord of the Himeji Domain In the early Edo period, the shogunate ensured political dominance by forcing many lords to move from domain to domain. This was carried out under the shogun's sole authority. Clans could not object under any circumstances. Not only samurai were forced to move, but also their families, leaving their beloved homes behind. Some clans had to relocate as many as 10,000 people, a great deal more than the entourages of lords forced to serve in Edo. To protect strategic domains, one clan was ordered to move repeatedly: the Echizen Matsudaira clan. All stop! My lord! My lord! My lord! Forgive me! A dream? A bad dream, my lord? A childhood memory. My father died in transit. It was terrible. How awful... My darling... My lord! W-What?! How dare you! Forgive me! Kohei? What brings you here? Express palanquin from Edo. "Kohei Nakata Edo liaison" Shocking news. Word has it our clan will soon be ordered to relocate! Relocate again?! And...our destination... is Hita...in Bungo Province. Bungo is in Kyushu. We must cross the sea? What's more... A reduction in land? Our income... will decrease by half. Half?! It is rumored we were nominated by Yoshiyasu Yanagisawa. Yanagisawa? Such a sudden relocation can only be accomplished by...an expert. Find one! Is there anyone who can save us from... ...this calamity?! Samurai Shifters "Samurai Shifters" "Library" The hero of this story is a librarian. The book he's holding is the Takeda clan's battle chronicle, "Koyo Gunkan Zakki." Ingenious! Good old Shingen Takeda. It's been a favorite of his since he was a child. Katagiri? Are you here? Yamazato! "Harunosuke Katagiri Librarian" "Ichirota Yamazato Naonori's secretary" Thank you, once again. Oh, do we have “Chronicle of Chosokabe Motochika”? Try this too. I see. A differing opinion on him? You are most considerate. I must go. Yamazato is a most studious man. He is well respected, and will surely rise in status. "Genemon Takamura Sword attendant" Hey! Snail Boy! Hey Snail Boy! This is urgent! I'm not here! You idiot. Yes you are! Please don't come in. This place reeks of mold. I like it. The selfless scent of paper, ink, and time. So soothing... Rejoice! You have a title now. What...title? Kyushu would mean moving a greater distance than ever before. We cannot afford to pay for such a relocation! Worse still, not only will we have to move to a new domain, our land will be reduced. Himeji's 150,000-koku will become 70,000 in Bungo. That's less than half! We must decide on who will take charge of the move... I pray that role is not forced upon me... So do I. One mistake and it's ritual suicide. Takamura. Will you do it? Me, sir? Young, and strong! Our lord trusts you. Martial arts are my only strength. I lack the attention to detail that relocation requires. I know... I know! The perfect man for the job! His name? Snail Boy. -Harunosuke! -Please let me go! It's about time you got some sunshine! I'm blinded! My eyes! My eyes! I-I'm not good at talking... You're the only one I can talk to... -Hey! Harunosuke! -No... If it goes badly, I'll commit suicide with you. You use your brains, and I'll use my brawn. Together, we'll be the perfect team. Let's go! -No! No, no! -You have to! You are now our officer in charge of relocation. "Officer"? Officer? Problem? W-Well, there's... ...a more qualified candidate. Our old relocation officer, Itakura? He was brilliant, but he's dead now. What about...others... There are none! Your father was an accomplished retainer. I hear you're a bookworm with extensive knowledge. We'll gamble on you. You shouldn't... No mumbling! We will leave all matters regarding the move to you. And that's not all. Our income will be reduced. Reduce personnel too! "Reduce personnel"? Your two roles. Fulfill them well. Where are you going?! Come back here! Come back here! Do it, Harunosuke! I can't! Then commit suicide! A samurai must serve his lord. If you cannot, commit suicide! I-I-I'll do it. I accept the role. Good! Like a true samurai. Don't worry, Katagiri. Just get the job done. Remember, there's a first time for everything. "Our clan has been ordered to move to another domain, so all subjects must prepare to move to Hita in Bungo..." Move?! "Relocation Officer"? Katagiri who? Katagiri! Is it true you're our relocation officer? Sort of. When's the move? When indeed... Wait! What does that mean? Katagiri! It's tough being a samurai! There you are! You're late! I heard from Takamura! You've finally become an officer! Congratulations! A party? My biggest since your weaning ceremony! W-Weaning? The first meal you ate when you were a baby. So, since you were a baby, you've done nothing worth celebrating! Alright! Time to drink! Don't look so glum. You really do take after your late father. Tama... How on earth am I going to do this? You're the only one who'll listen to me. Takamura. Writing this took all night?! "Pack things. Carry them" How can I move an entire clan? Let's at least take it easy today. We can't! First of all, you should ask Itakura for help. Itakura's dead. His daughter isn't. Daughter? Does she know how?! Yeah. Name's Oran. Quite a looker. I tried to woo her many times, but failed. I know! She won't help if I go see her. Harunosuke, you go on your own! Hello, Hayate. Nice weather, isn't it? Hayate, do you like that? Hey! Hayate! Calm down! W-Water... He wants water. Scratching with his foreleg. The sun's strong, and he's thirsty. You know horses? No, it was written in "Otsubo-Style Horsemanship." Hey! No, Otomatsu! Apologize! Hey jerk, you here to woo my mother? Otomatsu! Mother...? We only have boiled water. I'm... ...the new relocation officer, Harunosuke Katagiri. Relocation officer? A gift. Your father did this job, so p-perhaps you know where his n-notes are... Have you no shame?! It's true my father excelled at relocation. He saved this clan untold sums of money. However, as a low-ranking samurai, he was treated appallingly. You are high-ranking, correct? Yes, but... I remember his last job. He gave his all, despite his ill health. Nevertheless... high-ranking samurai took all the credit for themselves. I had no idea... When Father died, Mother was devastated, and soon followed him... Please leave! Sajima... What? W-Well...First, the cost... How much? How much indeed... Fool! You don't even know that?! The last move cost around 15,000 ryo, 15 years ago, so we'll need 20,000 ryo. 20,000?! "Treasurer" The problem is, as of now, our clan only has 3,000 ryo. We're 17,000 sh-short? Idiot! It's your job to make the shortfall! Or borrow it from merchants. Once borrowed, it's ours. But that's...despicable... Despicable? They worked long and hard for that money... They're lowly merchants! Our priority is saving our clan! Sure... "Sure"?! Say "Yes"! Yes! "Kenmotsu Nakanishi Head accountant" I can't take these carp with me. No... My lord! We've agreed on a date for us to take over Hita. July 20th. In two months time... However...I am struggling to make sense of this move. Why must we... Kohei, actually... I think I may know why. Last year, when I served in Edo... "Edo Castle, Six months earlier" Sire! Sire! Please wait! Begone! Sire... Let go. Let go, I say! But sire, I sacrificed everything... Don't embarrass yourself, Yoshiyasu. Unbelievable! "Yoshiyasu Yanagisawa Shogun's steward" Naonori Matsudaira? The Chief Retainer will be along shortly. Please wait. Thank you. Yes? What are you... Such smooth skin... Drink with me tonight. Stop it! Let go! How dare you! Damn you... Just you wait! I would have said yes, but it was too sudden, so... How...can you say that?! Unbelievable! Still, I doubt that is why we are being forced to move. What? Th-That's why. That's exactly why! What? Such a flagrant rejection would certainly incur the wrath of a man like Yoshiyasu. Should I have indulged him? Absolutely not! One night... wouldn't have hurt... "Itakura family grave" Sir Itakura, doing this job as a low-ranking samurai must have been very difficult. I'm sure you suffered working under a man like Sajima, much more than I am now. What's that jerk up to? He's high-ranking too. Only kind when it suits him. We can't change the past, but we can change the future. Snail Boy doesn't care about rank. That's the man he is. Tomorrow, if he doesn't put forward a plan, he's done for. On behalf of our clan, I apologize. You were robbed of credit, and poorly treated. I'm deeply sorry. Katagiri. Do we have a relocation plan yet? I'm...still looking into it. We're doomed... You cretin! We're running out of time! Gah! Just commit suicide! Be a man! Stop struggling! Don't wrap it! Don't! Please don't! Takamura! Takamura! Looks like it's up to me to... No! finish him off. Halt! Who goes there? You're... What?! Please stop! What the... Women are best at sorting, packing, and cleaning. You need a woman's touch! Who are you? This is...Itakura's daughter! The keys to moving are... ...all in here. Our original 10-step program. The late Itakura's relocation notes! A relocation plan... ...has been agreed with Katagiri. So, we're all set to go! I've chosen 10 promising prospects, wanting to test themselves. "Up comes the sun We stand at attention" "Stand at attention" "Another hellish day today of relocation" As the notes say, song is the key to uniting hearts and minds. "Dirt and dust" "Sleeve binding and mutual helping" "Selecting, sorting, sharing" "Packing, making, accelerating" "Harunosuke Katagiri Relocation Officer" Katagiri. I... ...am your new... relocation officer... ...Katagiri... Relocation... ...is like war. I want us to march to glory. Let's...get there together. Why did you save me? We disrespected your father... A samurai shouldn't humble himself so easily. My father hated sweets, but you brought them, even to his grave. I'm sorry. Harunosuke! What Oran means is... she appreciated it. Take them already! "The Itakura Relocation... ...10-Step Manual"? First, the hell of writing. "Hell"? The bulk of relocation documents were written for the clan set to take over a domain. They contained detailed information on the castle and domain itself. Their contents were vast in range and volume. Ledgers accurately recorded crop yields per village, as well as land tax averages over the previous five years. Maps were made of the castle and domain. Er, measure away. 5 ken, 2 shaku tall. Farmland reclamation, castles and roads, and other construction and repairs were thoroughly documented. "Call out to each other Reach out to each other" "Lift light luggage, like so! Like so!" These samurai sing as if they will be doing the carrying, but during relocation, cargo and people were conveyed by hired porters. Therefore, relocation planners had to procure numerous workers and horses. Last time, porters and horses accounted for 40% of the cost. That much? We need to reduce our cargo. What's this? Move! Move! "Half of all families' household items must be... ...swiftly discarded"?! Is this some joke?! Snail Boy! Snail Boy! Are you... ...sure about this? "Decluttering" Decluttering is... ...disposal. Alright. Now then... Right! We're going in! Iron kettles... "Check inside iron kettles." Hey! What's all this?! Move! Move! Katagiri the snail boy! How dare you enter! Stand strong! I'm sorry! Hands off! Are you hurt, sir?! Appraisal approval! "Genemon Hiruta. "Relocation officer Harunosuke Katagiri is to be allowed to appraise and discard unnecessary items"! Issued by Chief Retainer Motomura. You're still just a lowly snail! Discard unnecessary items! F-Fool! This is rare Nanbu ironware! But you have a new one. This is rusted inside. In other words, unnecessary! Don't worry. You'll get proceeds from any sales. Wait, Takamura! Yeah? What? Appraisal over! Speed it up! Three more houses! "Ono family residence" Katagiri. Katagiri! Get over here! What is it? What is it?! Dumping possessions is fine, but... What about my mistress? -Mistress? -You heard me! "Was the dream that we shared" "merely a fleeting mirage?" "Are you leaving..." Can I bring her on the sly? "...leaving from this town?" Please dump her. "Dump her"...? Dump her! Dump her?! Hey! "Private function" Your drinks, sirs. I'll remove these. So Harunosuke, you seem to be getting on well with Oran. Well, she always scolds me. That's a good sign. Pretty smiles are commonplace, but a true beauty's pretty even when angry. Even so, I want to see her smile. Smile, from the bottom of her heart. Harunosuke. Don't fall too deeply for Oran. Her husband divorced her, and she returned home. She has a child too. She's too much for an innocent like you. Takamura! Run faster! Dig deep! As the notes say, "Stay strong throughout your journey." Good effort. Well done. Very impressive. You're too nice. It's like, you're too friendly with everyone... What? Never mind. Pesky Snail Boy... Damn him! That spineless pest's finally showed his horns. He dumped lots of our stuff, but what about his? He'll use his status to take all his favorite books. The moment he got a title, he turned into a monster. "Absolutely do not open" -Is there time? -Don't know! "Absolutely do not open"? Coming through! How long? Four days in there. Has he chickened out? Snail Boy's gone back into his shell? Harunosuke! It's me! Open up! Harunosuke?! Every book on the floor... ...can burn. What now? I must... ...share their pain... My word... Now that's a fire! Finally realized they're worthless? All upset over some silly books, are you? What? -Move! -Oran! You brute! That bastard... "Koyo Gunkan Zakki"? You'll burn that too? So long... Do you really have to do this? It's alright. Every book I burned... I put in my head. You mean... ...you were... For four days? You alright?! Take it easy! There's still...so much... ...left to do. In this world money and women are roads to ruin I'll gladly... Coming through! The keys! Give them back! Your house is last on our appraisal list, Sajima. What? Appraisal approval! My house too?! Dump away! Three men to carry each heavy item! No! Stop! Stop! Stop this, Katagiri! Everything here is a collector's dream! I shall discard...nothing! And yet, you must. If so, give me a reason for discarding each item! Try and justify it! Oran. Yes? Large swathes of cloth. Cloth? Lift it up! Sajima. Please make a list of every item here. What? I want you to make a list of every item here. Anything you miss out isn't important, because you don't remember it. You dirty...snail boy! There! I'll begin my check. Remove the cloths. Something wrong? No... Appraisal over. This isn't on your list. W-Wait! It's Chinese, and rare! But you didn't remember it. That proves it's not important. So, it's unnecessary. It's an antique! Also...there's this... Wait! It's a scarce masterpiece of Imari porcelain! Oh my, look at all these plates! Not on the list either. Alright. Alright! I'll sort them myself... ...so spare me. Please? Spare me! Alright, you have one hour. If you can't do it... Don't! Sajima, please make it quick. "Sleeve binding and mutual helping" "Selecting, sorting, sharing" "Packing, making, accelerating" "Call out to each other Reach out to each other" "Lift light luggage, like so! Like so!" Did you see Sajima's face?! He was all teary-eyed over a crummy little pot! Now we need to find funds. It'll be tough... Katagiri! And you are...? Acc...Na... Sorry, what? Accountant...Nakani... Nakanishi? "Confidential Merchant Records" "Pharmacy" "400 ryo" I searched for potential merchant loaners. Why did you... I saw your...dedication. Nakanishi! Nakanishi! Oh, he's asleep. Now... Please eat heartily. This much? Thank you. I never imagined Harunosuke would have so many friends... Ma'am...I share your joy! This is superb! I visited all 450 merchants in our domain, investigating their business and word of mouth. Plus, you did it all after work... You're Itakura's daughter? I am. Sajima stole the credit for Itakura's successes, and effortlessly rose in status. His deceit disgusts me! But Katagiri, you don't walk over others. You ignore status and rank, and treat all equally. I like that. Right, right! That's right! I've always liked that about Snail Boy, since I was little! What... You expressed it well. Bravo, Nakanishi! -Ouch... -Come on, drink! No, I can't... Yes you can. Drink! "I humbly request your help." But...I doubt this alone will enable me to borrow 17,000 ryo. Not you. The Echizen Matsudaira clan. This way, this way! Hurry up! More cargo's coming. First, we'll try for half. 8,000 ryo from Izumiya. Saw-style business is booming. Saw-style? Freight transport. By ship. They make money going one way, and more in the other. Oh, so that's "saw-style." Good work. Oh, she's back. Izumiya's new wife. Young and good-looking. Flattering her makes him open his purse. Stop, stop! Let's go! Why not? We just need to flatter her. She looks worth it! You drank too much! Stay here. We can handle it. Can you? Stop! We'll be fine! -Have a seat. -Stay here! 8,000 ryo... I know it's sudden, but... ...my father has retired! When? Two days ago. He wants to travel alone with his wife. He's head over heels! I haven't slept, so... You should've known! I've taken over the business. I'll make sure we do things the right way. They're taking their time! Hurry it up! What's more, samurai tend to borrow, then refuse to repay. That reminds me. Speaking of loans, how is Sajima these days? I'll...help you with that. Hey! Harunosuke! I came to back you up! Harunosuke! Takamura! We told you to wait there! He's with them. -Stop it! Stop it, I say! -Izumiya's new wife... Oh, my lady... You're even prettier up close! Let me help. What can I do? Takamura. I read about a fainting pressure point. You're scarily clever. We've no choice... I beseech you. Please...lend us the money! Katagiri! All we can do now is plead with you desperately. Please. Lend us... ...the money! Get up, Katagiri... I beg you. I beg you. This is awkward... Izumiya. I bring... ...a message from our lord. Our lord is shrewd. Announcing his plan to ship sake to Kyushu for sale... That made Izumiya lend us the money. I was lying! I mean, there's no such plan, so now we need to find sake. We have to be resourceful, or we won't get through this! Indeed. Sir, are you sure? I lent it to that man, not his clan. He humbled himself so sincerely, I know he'll pay us back. "Making Hand-Drawn Carts" Yamamura, you dreamt of Oran again? Those buns look tasty. Will you again tonight? Harunosuke. What's wrong? Did you get a loan? Sure. 8,000. We'll get the rest tomorrow. Why shouldn't I? What's wrong with that? It's not normal. Smiling at them all the time, putting your hand in theirs... It's the least I can do. "The least"? "The least" what? It's an emergency. I'm using my feminine wiles. I wouldn't if I didn't have to. You smile...too much. Right? Leave them out of it. Bringing up the past is a bad habit. "The past" wasn't that long ago. What a couple. -Why does she like him -All the bad habits... -and not me? -You're so stubborn. Keep it down! Kids get told to go to sleep, but adults do whatever they want. Adults aren't fair! Adults aren't fair! He's right. Otomatsu's dead right. Now we've reduced our cargo... ...we need to cut back on porters. Everyone, please listen. We still need to borrow 9,000 ryo... ...but let's not. First, I have an idea. Instead of hiring porters, let's carry everything ourselves. But we samurai don't carry our belongings! Right! Or tend to horses! Please listen! If we borrow more, our future lives, and children, will be burdened heavily. That wouldn't be fair. Please! But if we samurai do that, we'll be stopped at checkpoints... Look at this. Who are those strange men? Nakanishi! It's a mud pack. That's clever. We need your cooperation. Please, spread the word. Strengthen your lower half! Up comes the sun We stand at attention Stand at attention Call out to each other Reach out to each other Keep your elbows in! Dig deep... Dig deep... Dig deep! Dig deep! Dig deep! Such ambition for advancement... What a pity. The relocation is proceeding smoothly. We put an incompetent in charge, but he's surprisingly daring. I promise... ...to guide Lord Matsudaira toward punishment and run. Lord Yanagisawa wants more than relocation. He wants us shogunate spies to wreak havoc. When our income decreases by half, he'll have to let many samurai go. Those he cruelly discards will not go quietly! So, how many will we let go? Well...for a start, Only 600? Including retainers in Edo, our clan has over 2,000. Our income will halve. 1,000 need to go. That won't be necessary. Leaving Himeji Castle will lessen our burden. However, if we keep that many, land tax in Hita won't pay for them. We'll begin a new venture there. First, we'll sell Harima sake in Kyushu. What? Is something wrong? Er, well, no... You're very resourceful. Fujiwara. Kohei? Why aren't you in Edo? I've rushed here to meet the man who halved our moving costs. Is it you? You're our relocation officer? I am. I'm amazed you managed to convince everyone. No, I merely humbled myself. Anyone would have. Anyone? Few men could have achieved that. Based on past experience, our clan could be forced to move again. We must persevere, and heal our wounds. We are a prestigious clan! If we're made to move again, our income could increase! Increase? Is that possible?! Indeed it is. I have an idea. A way to keep all our retainers. What? From "Koyo Gunkan Zakki." The Takeda clan? This is our way to go to war against an unjust shogunate! "Retainer dismissal day" Mr...Kitao? Toshizo Kitao. As of today...you are dismissed. Why?! Why me?! What else am I supposed to do?! My apologies. Those with families were given priority. But I'm... ...still a dependent. How could I have married?! We won't cut you loose. I have an idea. What's that? Kitao. Today, you'll become... ...a farmer. A farmer? Outrageous! You expect me to dig dirt?! Please. I am a proud samurai! "Koyo Gunkan Zakki" says, "He who takes up farming lives to see another day." The Takeda clan later rose again and became shogunate retainers. It was their plan?! It will only be temporary. If our clan's income increases again, I promise... we will reinstate you. I don't believe you! You're just spinning a tall story to conceal the truth! If you kill me... you'll be finished. Survive and be patient... and one day... ...you will rejoin us. For you, it will be temporary. For me, it will be an eternity! What happened? He looks devastated. But why? He's a farmer now. Oh, is that all...A farmer?! Takahashi. I have...an elderly mother. Surely you...have a mother too? If no one quits, our clan will perish. But...if you become a farmer, some day... I can't! I can't. I'd rather kill myself! I'll kill myself. I'll...haunt your family for generations! I'll kill myself! Takahashi... I'll definitely...kill myself! I will! Don't go! Men who say things like that definitely won't go through with it. "Ichirota Yamazato" Ichirota Yamazato. I thought we... understood each other. I thought you...knew me well. I do. I know you study diligently, and are dedicated to our clan. Then why... Why must I stay behind,... abandon my sword and... ...become a farmer?! Because I know you! Among those who stay behind, we need someone who is well admired and capable. When our income increases, I want you to lead our men in becoming samurai again. Turn this land...into fields? Yes. This is Yasusada Miyazaki's farming compendium. Based on experience, and extensive. You're the only man who can put it to good use. I see now. You were serious about reinstating me as a samurai one day. Very well. I shall do as you say. I'll talk to each new farmer and try to win them over. Thank you! Nevertheless... ...it's possible we may never be reinstated. If we're not, all my studies to date... ...will have been for nothing. Oran. I... I... I'm sure this is hurting you... ...more than it hurt my father. The day has come. Everyone...time to pack. Get to work! "Time to bid farewell and spring to action" "Another vexing day today of relocation" "Pillars and walls need protection" "Quickly and slowly Careful transportation" "Pull it out, cook it up, send it away" "Cats, grandkids, and babies to convey" I'll inspect all weapons! All castle items go in the storeroom below! This is for you. Like I said, Hita Castle is smaller. Once we move, instead of unpacking, use these boxes as is. Okay. For you. "Matsudaira clan ancestral spear" Now then, be extremely careful. Oh, stand it up. Will do! The spear! What a sight! Please be careful. It's irreplaceable. Boy, I'd love to hold that one day! I'll bet. -That one? -No. This has no label! Label it. Watch your step. It's narrow there! Look up! Don't bump it. That's it! Slowly, slowly... Hey Harunosuke. Did you and Oran... ...do it?! Are you crazy?! You're flustered like you did something. Like what? -Katagiri! -Is it true?! Is it?! He's no longer a virgin. Watch out! He'll start acting like a big shot. Oh no! How terrifying! You're wrong! I'm still a virgin. So... When will you leave? I'll... Hey, gently. Be careful. What'll you do? Itakura is dead, so Oran has lost her connection to our clan. Stop crying... Our lord has arrived! We won't see it again. Katagiri. Attend the castle transfer ceremony. As you wish. Takamura, I'm relying on you to get them to Ushimado port. But...don't you think this has gone too smoothly? I get the feeling our battle's far from over. Smoothly is satisfactory! Well, I'll be seeing you. Listen up! No sightseeing, no shopping, and no selling on the way! No whoring, gambling, or fighting either! Take your own advice. Our destination is Hita! Clan, on your feet! "Harunosuke Katagiri Relocation Officer" And now, the castle transfer ceremony! We welcome you after your long journey. "Yoshinori Ishida Fukushima clan chief retainer" Thank you. A long journey is ahead of you now. We are grateful for your gracious preparation of the castle. Proceed! Begin. Begin. The transfer of Himeji Castle is now complete! Otomatsu's asleep. Care to come in? Did you come to cry again? No... I... You came to say goodbye. Now my father's dead, I'm not part of this clan anymore. Yes. Even so... Even so... I want to be with you, Oran. But I've dismissed many samurai. My desire is selfish... Katagiri. Did you get carried away and say "I want to be with you"? No. I mean, yes! I mean... Do you mean, you can't bear to be without me? Forgive me! I shouldn't have... I acted on impulse... Alright! Let's go together. Make me your wife. Then we'll be family. You'll be able to take us. You don't want to?! I'm not worthy... ...but please accept me. I do. Please accept us too.

He beat me to it! Oh, the shame! Oh, the shame! Hear that?! Husband and wife! A tree has fallen! Go around and straight ahead! Straight ahead! A tree has fallen! Go around and straight ahead! Straight ahead! Go around and straight ahead! They fell for it. Boy, they look tasty. No eating till we reach the port. Oh, you're right! You got told off. Takamura, he beat you to it. Can't call him Snail Boy now. Shut up, you! Who are they? This procession... ...shall not pass. No...We've come all this way! I was right! Takamura? You're dressed for battle? See? I told you! I was right! These fishermen are spies in disguise! I knew things were going too smoothly! Now, do your worst. Do your worst! The fun's just beginning! Clansmen, cut down these scoundrels! Onward! Onward! Onward! This way! Grab a bat! Their relocation training toughened them up! Toda! I'm...I'm on your side! You traitor, Fujiwara! Oh no! Please, let me live! Lift it up! What? What happened?!

Imari porcelain really is quality! Wait! Not that... Hey! Stop! Stop! Another one! Another one! Please stop! Defend the palanquin! W-What now?! Defend the palanquin! Ayase! The spear. Takamura! Our lord says use it! That's our ancestral spear! Really?! Yes! Really?! Well I'll be... Now, dodge this! Heavy, right? It's heavy. Lift it. Come on! Good! Takamura! Takamura! Spin it, spin it!

My lord! Kohei? We were betrayed! Those men were Yanagisawa's spies! Not Yoshiyasu again! He's relentless! Who? Who betrayed us?! Fujiwara! Going somewhere? Somewhere... Somewhere...over...that way. That way? The traitor who betrayed us and plotted with spies is you. How pitiful. When the sky clears with our cargo we shall run" "Another day again today of relocation" "Storm clouds on the horizon as we cross over mountains" "When rain starts to fall..." "Hita, Bungo Province 10 days later" "Nagayama Castle" All stop! All stop! Open the gate! This...can't be right. We made it, but this is less a castle and more a residence. Our lord has arrived! My people, we have relocated safely, thanks to you. Himeji is no longer our home. We are now samurai of Hita. Be proud of it. "To Ichirota Yamazato" Harunosuke sent letters to the ex-samurai farmers left behind in Himeji. "We have arrived at the castle in Hita, Bungo Province." "There are not enough houses to accommodate all our retainers." He informed them of every daily development. He did so to remind them they would always be clansmen. The Matsudaira clan resided in Hita for seven years, but more hardships awaited. They were forced to change domains again, to Yamagata, in Dewa. their income did not increase, so they could not bring dismissed samurai back to the clan. "During this relocation, Chief Retainer Motomura passed away." "After his 49th-day memorial service..." Eight years went by in Yamagata. Then one day, nearly 15 years after leaving Himeji... "Spring, 1697" Otomatsu. Harutaro. You've...come of age at last. Yes, Father. Now you can serve. Otomatsu, you came of age on a stormy day. Yes, it was such a pity. So much rain back then. You turned up soaking wet. You've...grown up splendidly! Your grandma would be proud... I'm sure...I'm sure... Stop sniveling! This is a celebration! Harunosuke! Gohei! Everyone... We must move again! Another relocation... Will...our income increase? Our income will... ...increase by 80,000 koku. We'll be back to 150,000! Yes! So, Kohei. Where's our new domain? Shirakawa, in Mutsu. Still, it's what we waited for. We must relocate... We'll be fine. Why? Harunosuke preserved and compiled my father's relocation notes. With these, we can move anywhere in Japan. "Himeji" Can we...? You can! I put you... I put you through so much! Waiting is hard. So is making someone wait. I'm sure it was hard for you too, Katagiri! Don't say that. I lived in comfort, and even became a father... I became a father here too. My father really was a samurai! You tell 'em, son! I never, ever forgot about you. Katagiri, do you remember me? Of course I do! You haven't forgotten how to carry a sword? I forgot! I like hoes better! Our clan's new home is Shirakawa, in Mutsu. 150,000 koku. 150,000 koku?! Now, let's go home! Katagiri! Kitao? Kitao! You should...come with us. This is...amazing. Katagiri. Sorry, but I'm not going. Why? At last... At last, you're a samurai again. At first, I hated this life. I was ashamed. But day by day, coming into contact with rice plants, fields, and nature, I felt a way I'd never felt before. If I don't go back, I'll be betraying our lord. But, now... ...living without this is something I can't do. Kitao... We decided that, if you came, 40 of us would stay. I see. Now I'm older, I think I understand. In this great big world, We owe our lives to the mercy of nature. The fields we cultivated with 600 will be split among 40. We're gonna be rich! "Shirakawa Castle, Mutsu Province" Now we can smile. Welcome home. Men, you're home now. My lord! Your hand will be dirtied! The scars on your hand are proof you have fought for this clan. You should be proud. Katagiri. As of today, you are Chief Retainer. M-Me, my lord? Look around you. No one here will object. You know everything from accounting to liaison with Edo. You're perfect. But, I'm... Hey. If you won't, I will. Not on your life. If you so ask, I humbly accept. Good! Let's revive this clan together! I don't know. Snail Boy as chief retainer? That's what he is. By the way, Katagiri. What is this? Behold, my lord. Magoshichiro Takatsuka. Motonari Iida. Chubei Fukunaga... These are the names of our samurai who died as farmers. And these are the swords of those who remain in Himeji as farmers. With this... all 2,156 of our men... have returned home. At last... Everyone! These loyal retainers fought for our clan! Welcome home! Welcome home!
