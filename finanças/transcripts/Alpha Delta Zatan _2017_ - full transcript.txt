(guys cheer) - Can't wait for the big game! We are going to crush California! - Damn right, bro! Go Harlequins! - I can't believe I'm going to miss the playoffs. You know there's nothing I could do or say about it! Our House President made me the designated driver for the weekend. Paul, it's time for you to serve your purpose. You know, I swear Sebastian is so petty. I think he is still mad at me over the frat house election. (bell jingles) He beat me by one vote! Oh, well, right? I guess there's always next year's election. In the meantime, I have to be on stand-by in case one of our house brothers gets too wasted and needs my help getting back home. All right, yeah. I'll talk to you later. Love you. (water runs) (suspenseful music) (gasps) (screams) (guys cheer) (ominous music) (ominous music) - Hello? - [Sebastian] Bryce? - Hi, Sebastian. - You are early. - I hope you don't mind. I turned in my dorm key to the school administrator. I had nowhere else to go. - Of course. I love punctuality. I mean, being early is a terrific quality to possess nowadays. Hopefully it'll rub off on some of our less reliable brothers. - Where's everyone? - Most of the frat is out of town this weekend for the playoffs. - That's right. Go Harlequins! - Yes. - I hope you didn't miss out on the fun because of me. - Not at all. It is my honor as President of this Fraternity to welcome each and every one of our new brothers. - Thank you. I'm honored to be invited. Surprised, really, but honored. - You shouldn't be. Yes, we are very selective, but we believe that every single one of our brothers serves a higher purpose. You are valuable to us. You are part of the future. We are the lucky ones to have you. - What's my purpose? - That is for you to find out. I was going out for a run. But let me grab your key and I'll show you to your new room. - Great. - [Sebastian Voiceover] That's correct, officer. After losing our fraternity election a few weeks ago, Paul said he was done with school and with everybody in this house. He was acting very hostile. I had no choice, but to report him to our house sponsor, Brad Beauchamp. You know, the venture capitalist. Anyway, we invited Paul to the playoffs, but he said no. So we all went to the stadium and when we came back, all his stuff was gone! I mean, his parents are mortified. We are very worried about him. Please just let us know if you hear anything from him. - [Bryce Voiceover] Why do I want to be part of this fraternity? Because I want to be a good leader. That's what the world needs right now. Leaders with integrity. Leaders with values. And transparency. We need leaders who can inspire others to become the best they can be. Look at this fraternity's record. Presidents, senators, CEOs, award-winners. I would die for the opportunity to be in the company of so many people I look up to. I want to learn how to be like them. And I want to contribute too. I know I have so much in me to give. So much that I want to give. - You must be the new guy. Bryce, right? - Nice to meet you. - Call me King. Would you like some protein? - I'm good, thank you. I'm actually going to get something to eat. Do you wanna join? - I'm full right now, brother. Actually just finished practice and I'm dead. - Practice? I thought the Harlequins were playing out of town this weekend. - I'm with The Wall Crushers, the school's Rugby team. Do you know we are the best ranked team on campus? But the only team anybody in this school seems to care about is the Harlequins. They are clowns! Literally! - People seem to be rallying behind clowns these days. (chuckles) - You are funny. A great sense of humor is a great quality to possess these days. - I'm going to go get my food. Let me know more about the Wall Crushers when I come back. - I'll be here. (ominous music) Yeah. Oh. Yeah. (suspenseful music) (water runs) Really? (bell jingles) Hello? You know I'm really not in the mood for games right now! (bell jingles) (door creaks) (suspenseful music) (ominous music) - [Bryce] Anyone here? (bell jingles) - [Sebastian] Please, God, Dinesh. You are making a scene. - [Dinesh] This is not fair. You can't punish me for exposing the truth to the public! - Actually, I can punish you and I will. You see, my job is to preserve the prestige of this institution. You broke one of the most important of all house rules. You're out! - You're ruining my life! - This conversation is now over. You don't live here anymore. You are no longer one of our brothers. It's time for you to get out of here, Dinesh. - You'll pay for this. All of you! - [Bryce] What was that about? - Sorry you had to witness that. Dinesh's turned into a real big disappointment. - What did he do? - How's your room, Bryce? Are you comfortable? - Yes. - Good. Because that's all we care about. I gotta go now. I have a meeting with one of our house sponsor. I'll see you later. (yawns) - Rough night? - [King] I had trouble sleeping. - Tell me about it. Take a look at this. Have you seen a mask like this one before? - It's not in the school colors. - Do you know who used to stay in my dorm room before I moved in? It probably belonged to him. - His name is Paul. Cool kid, very loyal. He actually stayed in your room for a while. But he broke the house rules. So Sebastian kicked him out. - [Bryce] What did he do? - He was the designated driver during the first game in the playoffs last year. But he abandoned his shift without giving notice to anyone and Sebastian didn't take that well. - Sebastian seems to have low tolerance for mistakes. I mean we're only in college. - Blame it on Frat Dad Brad. - You mean Brad Beauchamp? - He's our biggest donor. He actually owns this place. He used to be Frat House President years ago and now all the House Presidents report to him. - I didn't know he was so heavily involved with the day-to-day stuff. - He is very hands-on. A great quality. Frat Dad Brad represents everything that a good leader should be. You'll get to meet him eventually. He always shows up unannounced. I'm still hungry. (groans) - [Dinesh] You need to be careful. - Dinesh, right? Look, I just got here. I don't want any trouble. I'm sorry what happened, but I had nothing to do with it-- - Forget about the stupid frat house. You need to watch out for the house brothers. Especially Sebastian. - I'm not the gossip type. - I used to write for the school newspaper. I wanted to be a journalist! Sebastian and Brad ruined my life. I lost my job at the school newspaper and I just found I also lost my scholarship too! This frat house has connections everywhere. If they don't want you, they can make you disappear. No questions asked. - Why would they do that do you? - I exposed their secrets. I told everyone about their purpose. - What secrets? What's this? - I gave this article to my editor, thinking that he would support me. But he killed the story. And then he had my school email disconnected for good. But I saved a personal draft on my laptop before it was stolen a three days later. Turns out the newspaper is funded by Frat Dad Brad! - What do you want me to do with it? - Learn the truth before it's too late. - [Man] Is that you, Dinesh? Do we need to get a restraining order against you? - Hide the article. Hide it. Quick, quick! Stay away from me! - Don't come back or we'll call the cops! Sorry about that. I can't stand the liberal press. It's really a shame because Dinesh's imagination is an asset. A crazy personality trait when mismanaged, but a valuable quality to possess otherwise. You must be Bryce, right? My name is Todd. I'm the House's vice-president. I just got back from visiting my family in Virginia. - Nice to meet you. (water runs) (bell jingles) - [Bryce] Can we talk? - Sure. What's up? - What's that? - I don't know. I found it in here the other night. Looks like some kind of toy to me. - It's a rattling bell. Like from a jester costume. Or a jester's mask. - Well, that about explains it. There are Harlequin masks all over campus right now. It's Harlequin Fever ever since the stupid football team made it to the college playoffs. When is the school gonna get some rugby fever? Did I mention we are undefeated? Anyways, you said you wanted to talk? - Yeah. Do you have that guy's, Paul's, contact information? - I do. - Can I have it? I just want to see if he wants his mask back. - You got it. - I'm late for class. I'll talk to you later. - We need to talk. - I'm here! You said it was urgent! Here I am! Where are you? (bell jingles) What are you wearing? Very theatrical of you! I would describe this moment as histrionic. But I don't have time for this song and dance right now. I only came to meet you because I need my scholarship back. Get me my scholarship back! Take off that mask! (suspenseful music) - Did you speak with Brad about Dinesh? - Yes. I'm glad it's all been taken care of. - I saw Dinesh speaking to the new kid earlier. I hope it's not too late for our new recruit. - Don't worry about it. Bryce will serve his purpose eventually. Just like Dinesh did. - You have some right here. - Yummy. (water runs) - [Bryce Voiceover] According to our campus police, a total of six fraternity members have disappeared in the last year. But no missing person reports have been filed by the local police, the university, or the missing kids' parents. (suspenseful music) (ominous music) (screams) - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. It was just a really bad dream. - You and everyone else on campus. The Harlequins, they lost last night. - That's a shame. - At least we still have the undefeated rugby team and we have King. They are the school's true pride if you ask me. - Speaking of pride, do you mind telling me about the history of the frat house. - This could turn into a really long talk, Bryce. What do you want to know? - I hear others talking highly of Frat Dad Brad. Is that what you guys call him? - Oh, yes. Everybody loves Brad. But do you want to hear a confession? I despise him. Don't tell anybody! I only said that because I ate too much and now I'm feeling very imaginative. - Your secret is safe with me. - Good. - Why don't you like him? - I'm not the President he wanted. But I'm the one he got. But that's a story for another time. You should get some rest. - Good night. - By the way, I'm sorry again about Dinesh disturbing the peace earlier. Todd told me he attacked you while you were outside-- - I wouldn't call it an attack. - You're a kind soul, Bryce. That's an outstanding quality to possess. It's very rare to find these days. - I do my best. - By the way, Dinesh's mom called me a few hours ago to apologize about his actions. - She did? - Yes. Apparently, Dinesh had some sort of a mental breakdown and he had to be hospitalized. His mom said that his job at the newspaper and school were too much stress for him to handle. I'm hoping he gets the help that he needs so he is no longer a danger to himself or to others. Good night. (ominous music) (muffled groans) (suspenseful music) (bell jingles) - Man, I hate Mondays, Marco. - Mondays are particularly bad after a humiliating game loss, Anthony. - Where's everybody? - Class, probably. - I repeat, I hate Mondays. - Listen, I'ma get some rest before my evening class. - All right, I'm getting a quick workout. Talk later? - Yeah. Cool. (techno music) (water runs) - Dinesh served his purpose. Paul served his purpose. It really makes you think. - About what? - Are we next? - Brad would not allow it. - He allowed it to happen to King. A senior! - And the biggest snitch in the house. - I just wish he didn't say anything at all. Why did he have to call me? - You did the right thing by telling the leadership. - Did I? - You know that type of talk sealed Dinesh and King's faith, amigo. - What? Are you gonna tell on me? - You know discretion is my best quality. I would never betray any of my friends. - I appreciate it. - But don't ever make me betray my Greek letters. You hear me? - Yeah, of course. - All right, I should get ready for class. See you later. (ominous music) - [Brad] Missed class tonight? - Brad. Hello. What a pleasant surprise. Yes, I wasn't feeling well today. I have an awful headache. - Is something troubling you, Marco? - Just silly school stuff. No need to worry about me, really. My meditation helps me relax. I practice every day, an one hour a day. Works like magic. - I've always admired your strong sense of spirituality. - Thank you. - I wish more people in today's society could be like you. Your inner power would be a great quality for a leader to possess. The world needs more thoughtful leaders today. Don't you think? - I, I don't. I don't think anybody should be like me. Not at all! - Explain. - I'm selfish! I don't care about anyone, but myself. Yes, I care about the world and the people around me But I look inward not to relax, but to disappear. I don't have time to deal with anyone else's problems, but my own. Would any leader really want to possess such selfish qualities? I basically suck. (laughs) - Oh, my dear boy. I'm sorry to hear you have those feelings inside of you. But do you want to know something else? - What's that? - It's not for you to decide what a true leader needs. I forgot, I found this little thing outside your door. Is it yours? - So? - It's not Marco's time to serve his purpose. - He's showing signs of toxic behavior, Brad! - Marco possesses valuable qualities, but he is not the type of person people take seriously. He is not a leader. He is not a threat right now. - But-- - More importantly, the house has lost too many brothers lately. People are starting to ask questions. And frankly, I'm beginning to question your alleged best quality. Your leadership skills. - I have done everything in my power to secure the reputation of this house! - You can do better. You can always do better, Sebastian. - Bro, I can't believe Sebastian forced me to stay here while everybody else is out watching the game. - I would trade places with you if I could. I'm not looking forward to spending the weekend with my parents, especially the General. - I know you have problems with your dad. That sucks. But, you know I'm here for you if you need anything. Okay? - You're a good friend, Paul. Very loyal. We all admire your sense of integrity and friendship. It's a very good-- - Yes, yes, I know. It is a very valuable quality to possess. (laughs) This frat house is all about positive reinforcement, right? - I think this place is about sharing everything that is good about us and infecting other people with it. - Hi, Todd. Have a good night. - You too. - You haven't seen King anywhere, have you? I haven't seen him around in a while. Hope he didn't get kicked out. I'm just joking. - He had to leave town. Family emergency. - Is everything all right? - That's not a polite question to ask, Bryce. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean-- - Discretion is very important, especially when it comes to private matters. - I understand. - Do you? - [Bryce] I think I do. - Do you know what my strongest quality is? Compliance. I am very compliant. The most obedient. I've always being the disciplined one. Even as a kid, I always did what was expected of me. You ask something from me, I deliver it! You assign a task to me, I execute it! I can't stand people who are not aligned. Are you in line, Bryce? - Of course I am. Look, I know I'm the new kid here, but I love this frat house. I've always wanted to be one of you guys. I just didn't know it'd be so much pressure. I'm just trying to please my parents. I'm sorry if I was rude. I should mind my own business. - Where are my manners? Look at me snapping at you like that! I sounded just like my father! I've been right where you are. Trust me, being a part of this fraternity comes with a huge responsibility. We are the future of this country. Nobody said it would be easy. But through this pain is how we find our purpose. I'm the one who should be sorry. Please, accept my apology. I'm sorry. - [Bryce] I appreciate that. - Have a good night. Okay? - You too. (bell jingles) - Do you have it? The mask I gave to Paul. Do you still have it? It's an antique. - Yes, it's right here. - May I see it, please? - Sure. - I didn't mean to scare you. I still have the original house key. - It's your house. - It's our home. You probably heard of me, but let me formally introduce myself. My name is Brad-- - Frat Dad Brad. - Bradley Beauchamp III. The boys still call me that, huh? Not gonna lie, I kinda like it. It's a nice looking piece, don't you think? It symbolizes our school spirit. But with more regal and prestigious colors. Like our frat house here, we are here next to everyone, but yet we are not really here. We are above. Why would Paul leave it behind? - They said he left in a rush. - Yes, that's what the school advisor said you told him. You went and spoke to him about some concerns you had about Paul and the house. Correct? You don't have to feel ashamed. I'm here to address any concerns raised by our frat brothers. It's my job. I care about you, kiddos. - I didn't have any concerns. I just wanted to know if he wanted his mask back. - I spoke to Paul's mother today. Her daddy and my dad were in Senate together. She said Paul has been sending her emails from Qatar and Dubai. He's spending a fortune, apparently! But she can't bring himself to say no to her little boy. It's really a shame because Paul had a great future. I saw a lot of myself in him. Anyway, she wanted me to mail her the mask. You don't mind if I take it from here. - Thanks for letting me know. I gotta go to my room. I have some home work to do. - Of course. It was nice spending some time together. I need a favor. I knew I could count on you. - Thanks for helping me sort this out. - [Marco] I could get in trouble for this. - Do you think this rattling bell is a warning sign? - The bell is not a warning, it's an omen. This is my death sentence! - Something happened to King and the others. Something bad. Am I right? You know what happened to them. Don't you? - They served their purpose. - What does that even mean? - We are alone, right? - I believe so. - You know my dad is a Congressman. Everybody loves him. It's a tough act to follow. - What are you doing? Are you crazy? Stop! Sit down! - I'm sorry. - Tell me what you know, please. - Everything going on here lately. It's all because of Black Harlequin. - The Black Harlequin? - [Marco] You've seen him, right? In your dreams. We all have. - How did you know that? - Every brother in this house has seen the Black Harlequin at least once. That's why I meditate every day. I can't get him out of my head! The Black Harlequin is the guardian of the fraternity values. He destroys you if you break the house rules! - We're just in college! - They don't care about that! They set the standards for us to fail. They expect us to be perfect, they want us to be undeniable. And if we disappoint them, they demand we serve-- - Our purpose. - I made a mistake. And now the Black Harlequin is coming for me next. - You think King was hurt by these people? - King is dead! Wake up! Paul, Dinesh, all dead! Just like I'm a dead man walking! - That can't be! Nobody could get away with all these crimes. - There's one person who can. And he has after all these years. He has money, he has power, and he has influence. - Who? - Frat Dad Brad. - We have to call the cops, now! I can't find my phone! We have to drive to the police station. Marco? - I'm afraid Marco has left the building. I'm still hungry. I think I'll have some more in a minute. - What did you do with him? - Nothing. You don't know him well, but Marco only thinks about himself. He is very selfish. And you know selfish people, they would do anything to survive. - Was he telling the truth? - About what? - Is there a killer? - A killer? Are you feeling okay, Bryce? You look flustered. - Answer me! Is there a Black Harlequin? - Well, yes. - You, you're the Black Harlequin. - What? No. I'm just messing with you. I'm sorry things didn't work out, Bryce. I admire your curiosity. But you should have been better at hiding things. Like Dinesh's silly newspaper article. I agree with you. You have a lot to give. (ominous music) - Where were you? - I was summoned by Frat Dad Brad. Did you do it? - I hate getting my hands dirty. I don't know how you can do this all the time, Todd. - Brad assigned the task to me. It had to be executed. - Brad, Brad, Brad. I can't stand his constant meddling! - You shouldn't talk about our frat sponsor like that. - Oh, please! We work so hard for this house! We are tasked with creating the new leaders of the so-called free world. Shouldn't we be allowed to lead then? - Brad just wants what's best for us. - You are so naive. Stop acting like a serving dog. - There's nothing wrong with following orders. - Whatever. - I know you don't like talking about Brad. But he asked me to give you something. - Like what? His laundry? - No. This. - This can't be right. - Shh. You did the right thing. - You think? - Yes. However, I don't think it's in the fraternity's best interest to keep you around as a brother. - Please, don't hurt me! - Marco, Marco, Marco. I won't hurt anyone anymore. I promise you that. You are free to go. - Thank you. - Thank you for taking care of things. - [Man] Thank you for the opportunity. I'm looking forward to more responsibility in the house. - [Todd] We count on you to get the job done. - [Man] I'm hungry. Should we? - [Todd] You know, I think we need to be more selective about what we put in our bodies going forward. - [Man] Copy that. - I'll notify Brad. What did Marco's dad say? - Congressman Martinez is devastated. But he agreed with me that Marco didn't have what it takes. Anyway, he is on his third wife and she is pregnant. He'll get another chance. - And his family? - Grieving, of course. But they'll figure out what to tell to the media when the time is right. Drug overdose or foreign kidnapping. I'm more concerned about this boy's family. - Not taking it well, huh? - Bryce was a first generation recruit. His parents don't understand yet the sacrifices people like us need to make for the greater good. Leadership can be a burden if a man doesn't possess the right qualities. They'll come around when their younger boy gets here in a couple of years. They are willing to do anything for their legacy. - I won't let you down, Brad. - [Brad] I'm glad to hear that. Your father will be proud of you. - How about a drink? - You know what I like. - I can't believe I got in! Thank you so much. - We are happy to have you. It's my first year as House President so I only want the best of the best living here. - It's going to be an exciting year. I can tell. - I've heard a lot about you. You are top of your class in Venezuela, right? - Well, yeah, I do my best. - I love your modesty. I have not seen that in a while around here. That is a wonderful quality to possess. Hopefully it will rub off on me. - Well, I'm happy to help you in any way I can. - I know you will. I'll check in on you later. I have a meeting with our sponsor. Excuse me. - Todd? - Yes? - The hazing, is the hazing gonna be terrible? - If it makes you feel any better, we all went through it. Don't worry too much. - Thank you. I'll live. (techno music)
