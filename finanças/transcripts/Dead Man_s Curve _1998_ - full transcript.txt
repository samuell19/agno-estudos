DON'T FORGET TO WRITE. YEAH. GOOD-BYE, THEN. BOY... SHE'S IN FOR A BIG SURPRISE. Woman: NO. JUST GO DOWN THERE, AND I'LL MEET YOU. [CLOCK BELL CHIMING] Doctor: THERE WAS NOTHING EITHER OF YOU COULD HAVE DONE TO PREVENT RAND'S DEATH. WHEN SOMEONE MAKES UP THEIR MIND TO TAKE THEIR LIFE, THERE'S NOTHING ANYONE CAN DO. REST ASSURED ALL OF THE UNIVERSITY'S RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU IN ORDER TO BETTER DEAL WITH THIS SITUATION. DR. ASHLEY HAS INFORMED ME THAT SHE WILL BE AT YOUR DISPOSAL. ANY TIME YOU NEED TO TALK, THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEBODY AT THE CRISIS CENTER, AND THEY KNOW HOW TO REACH ME. YOU HAVE A SOLID SUPPORT STRUCTURE HERE. I JUST WISH RAND WOULD'VE TAKEN FULL ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE KINDNESS THAT YOU PEOPLE HAVE TO OFFER. THANK YOU. Mr. Alexander: THAT'S THE REAL TRAGEDY, ISN'T IT? YES, SIR. RIGHT NOW, YOUR WELL-BEING IS OUR PRIMARY CONCERN. WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP YOU THROUGH THIS. NOW, IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE THAT THE TWO OF YOU HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO WORRY ABOUT OTHER THAN COPING WITH THIS TRAGIC SITUATION, THE UNIVERSITY WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND THE OFFER OF WAIVING YOUR ACADEMIC REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTING AN AUTOMATIC 4.0 GRADE POINT AVERAGE FOR THE SEMESTER. I'M SORRY. I'M NOT--AHEM. I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND YOU. IT'S STANDARD PRACTICE AT MOST STATE UNIVERSITIES. WHAT? DON'T WORRY. THE CIRCUMSTANCES BEHIND THE GRADES ARE KEPT STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL. LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. MY BEST--OUR BEST FRIEND KILLS HIMSELF, AND YOU WANT TO REWARD US WITH STRAIGHT As BECAUSE WE'RE HIS ROOMMATES? NOBODY'S REWARDING ANYBODY, TIM. IT'S SIMPLY SCHOOL POLICY. YOU'RE NOT OBLIGATED TO TAKE THE 4.0, BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD AT LEAST CONSIDER IT. YOU'LL HAVE ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT FINALS AND MIDTERMS. I CAN DEAL WITH THIS. I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP. DON'T TOUCH ME, CALM DOWN. ALL RIGHT? YOU TAKE THE 4.0. YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS SITUATION. Mr. Alexander: SON... PLEASE. WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS SOME OTHER TIME. MR. ALEXANDER, DR. ASHLEY, I'M SO EMBARRASSED. I'M SORRY. IT'S--IT'S JUST BEEN A LOT TO DEAL WITH. THAT'S WHY I ABSOLUTELY INSIST YOU LEAVE EVERYTHING UP TO US. NOW, WE'VE ALREADY NOTIFIED THE AUTHORITIES AND RAND'S FAMILY. WE'RE PLANNING A MEMORIAL SERVICE AS SOON AS THEY FIND THE BODY. Dr. Ashley: THEY HAVEN'T FOUND THE BODY? Mr. Alexander: NO. I'VE BEEN AFTER THE REGENTS FOR YEARS TO CLEAN UP THAT RIVER. IT'S FULL OF ALL KINDS OF POLLUTED GARBAGE. I HEARD YOU GET AMEBIC DYSENTERY IF YOU SWIM IN IT. YEAH, BUT WHO WANTS TO SWIM IN IT? THE STENCH THAT COMES OFF THAT THING--ARE YOU KIDDING? [TIM COUGHS] I'M SORRY. NOW, WHEN YOU FEEL UP TO IT, THE LOCAL POLICE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A WORD WITH BOTH OF YOU. DON'T WORRY. IT'S JUST A FORMALITY. IT'S FOR THE SAKE OF RAND'S FAMILY. OF COURSE. WE'LL DO ANYTHING WE CAN TO HELP. YES. I MUST SAY, YOU TWO ARE SETTING A GREAT EXAMPLE FOR THE REST OF THE STUDENT BODY. RAND WAS VERY WELL-LIKED, AND I'M SURE THERE ARE MANY STUDENTS WHO, WHEN THEY HEAR THE NEWS, WILL BE GRIEVING.

DO YOU REMEMBER THAT? FRAU ALICE. "THERE ARE NO BREAKFAST FOODS AFTER 11 A.M." I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO KILL HER. DON'T YOU REMEMBER THAT? AND HE TOLD HER HE WAS GOING TO CALL THE HASH BROWN PRESERVATION SOCIETY. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT? OH, BABE. I HAVE THE BEST RAND STORY. WE'RE HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS, RIGHT? OBVIOUSLY WAY BEFORE WE KNEW YOU GUYS-- AND IT IS, LIKE, JUST BEFORE THE SENIOR PROM. I HATED PROM. OH, YEAH. I'M SURE YOU HAD A REALLY TOUGH TIME, EMMA. SO RAND DATES THE SAME GIRL ALL THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL, AND A WEEK BEFORE THE PROM, SHE DUMPED HIM. BROKE HIS FUCKING HEART. THAT POOR GUY. I THINK HER NAME WAS WENDY. ANYWAY, IT WAS A WEEK BEFORE THE SENIOR PROM, AND THEY HAD PLANNED TO GO ALL YEAR, SO WENDY SAYS TO RAND, "WE SHOULD JUST GO AS FRIENDS." YOU KNOW, THE TOTAL WORST. SO RAND AGREES. SSS, SSS, SSS! CUT TO PROM NIGHT, AND WENDY IS WAITING FOR RAND TO SHOW UP. HE HAD RENTED A TUXEDO. HE HAD A LIMO. HE HAD GREAT RESERVATIONS. THE WHOLE NINE, RIGHT? AND I CAN JUST, I MEAN-- 7:00 ROLLS AROUND, NO RAND. 8:00, NO RAND. 10:00, AND THERE'S NO RAND. AND I CAN JUST SEE IT. SHE'S SITTING THERE ON THIS COUCH. YOU KNOW, MOM AND DAD HAVE THE CAMCORDER OUT, AND LITTLE SISTER GETS TO STAY UP LATE TO SEE THE BIG SISTER GO TO HER PROM. I MEAN, THIS KID WAS LIKE PART OF THE FAMILY, RIGHT? AND THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD'S OVER. NORMAN ROCKWELL, RIGHT? HA HA! 11:00, AND THERE'S STILL NO RAND TO BE FOUND. Emma: WHAT HAPPENED? DID HE GO? [LAUGHS] YEAH, HE--HE WENT TO THE PROM. HE, UM... BUT THE THING IS THAT HE ACTUALLY... HE ACTUALLY TOOK A HOOKER. [LAUGHS] AND NOT A HIGH-PRICED HOOKER, EITHER. I AM TALKING ABOUT THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL, BABY. I AM TALKING ABOUT "I WILL SUCK YOUR DICK FOR A CRACK ROCK," 10 BUCK, ON THE STREET CORNER WHORE. JUST A FAT FUCKING TRAMP-- HAIR, STRETCH MARKS, COMES IN WITH A TUBE TOP, LOOKING ALL PROUD. HA HA HA! AND SHE'S SPORTING THIS CORSAGE THAT HE HAD ORDERED SPECIAL FOR WENDY. IT WAS ORCHIDS. THAT WAS WENDY'S FAVORITE. BUT NOTHING IS AS PRICELESS AS THE PROM PICTURE-- SITTING THERE TOOTHLESS, THIS FAT FUCKING WHORE. OH, MAN. THE BEST PART IS, UH... WENDY WAS SO MORTIFIED THAT SHE ACTUALLY MISSED THE LAST 2 WEEKS OF SCHOOL AND, UH... AND HAD TO GO TO SUMMER SCHOOL TO GRADUATE AND ENDED UP GOING TO COLLEGE A YEAR LATE. OH, MAN, HE FUCKED THAT BITCH UP. [SOBS] YEAH, RAND DEFINITELY HAD A MEAN STREAK IN HIM. [TIM LAUGHS] Chris: WHERE IS RAND? IN HEAVEN. THE BODY. WHERE'S THE BODY? SHH! THE BODY IS IN THE RIVER, YOU IDIOT. WHY HASN'T IT COME UP YET? I DON'T KNOW, IT'S STUCK ON A TIRE OR SOMETHING. RELAX. THEY'LL FIND THE BODY. WE'LL GET OUR 4.0s. HAVE YOU EVER TRIED THE C.A.L.? VERY SMOOTH. HOW CAN YOU BE SO CALM ABOUT THIS? I THOUGHT-- SEE, I THOUGHT... YOU WANTED TO DO THIS. I WANT TO GET INTO HARVARD BUSINESS. THIS IS GETTING YOU INTO HARVARD BUSINESS. DON'T YOU FEEL THE SLIGHTEST AMOUNT OF GUILT ABOUT THIS? PLEASE. GUILT IS FOR KIDS. WHY DO YOU THINK STARBUCKS OPENS THEIR STORES NEXT TO NEIGHBORHOOD COFFEE SHOPS? CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS LATER, PLEASE? WHY, AM I EMBARRASSING YOU? IT'S ALL ABOUT SELLING THE BEANS. DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT STARBUCKS MEANS? STAR, BUCKS. STAR, UNIVERSE; BUCKS, MONEY. MONEY RUNS THE FUCKING UNIVERSE. NOW, YOU HAVE A CHOICE-- YOU CAN EITHER BE A SHORT NORMAL DRIP OR A POWER FUCKING GRANDE MOCHA LATTE. 31.25, TIMMY. Tim: JUST PUT IT ON THE TAB, BABY. [BELL CHIMES] I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR FRIEND AND HIS TROUBLES... I ASSUMED YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT YOURSELF. A LOT OF STUDENTS ARE EMBARRASSED TO ADMIT THAT THEY HAVE FEELINGS OF DESPAIR, SO IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR THEM TO PROJECT THEIR FEELINGS ONTO A FICTITIOUS FRIEND. THERE'S NOTHING ANYONE COULD'VE DONE. I MEAN, I KNOW THAT NOW. YEAH, BUT... RECONCILING OUR EMOTIONS AND OUR FEELINGS OF INADEQUACY WITH OUR LOGICAL, PRACTICAL WAY OF THINKING-- THAT'S THE HARD PART. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL MR. ALEXANDER I WAS ALREADY SEEING YOU? I DON'T TALK ABOUT ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THIS OFFICE. I TOOK AN OATH. N-NOTHING AT ALL? IF YOU DECIDED TO UNDERLINE PASSAGES IN CATCHER IN THE RYE AND TOLD ME YOU WERE GOING TO SHOOT THE PRESIDENT, I WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING. WHAT WOULD YOU DO? PLANNING ON KILLING THE PRESIDENT? [LAUGHS] NO. NO. IT'S JUST THAT... I THINK THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT. SO YOU SAY RAND WAS ACTING STRANGE THE LAST FEW WEEKS? YEAH. IT WAS WEIRD. HE BOUGHT--YOU KNOW, HE WAS BUYING DEPRESSING BOOKS AND VIDEOS AND... WAS RAND DRINKING RATHER HEAVILY THE LAST NIGHT YOU SAW HIM? THAT'D BE A BIG YES, SIR. REALLY? WOULD YOU SAY HE HAD A PROBLEM WITH ALCOHOL? YOU MEAN GETTING IT? [LAUGHS] JUST A LITTLE JOKE. SORRY. UM... DID HE HAVE A PROBLEM? I DON'T REALLY KNOW, BUT, CHRIS, YOU KNEW HIM A LOT BETTER THAN I DID. WHAT DO YOU THINK? WELL, UH, I MEAN, MAYBE, YEAH. I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU KNEW RAND SINCE THE FIFTH GRADE. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. I DID SAY THAT, BUT, YOU KNOW, COLLEGE, PEOPLE-- FRIENDS KIND OF DRIFT APART. WE WERE STILL LIKE THAT, BUT... OVER THE LAST YEAR, RAND AND CHRIS BECAME LIKE BROTHERS. BROTHERS. WAS HE UPSET THAT NIGHT? WELL, I, UM... I DON'T REALLY KNOW. CHRIS, YOU WERE WITH HIM A LOT MORE THAT NIGHT. WHAT DO YOU THINK? HE, UH... HE GOT INTO A FIGHT WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND NATALIE, AND, UH... SHE'S FROM CANADA. IS SHE CANADIAN? YEAH. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO CANADA? NO. NATALIE BRODER. WE HAVEN'T LOCATED HER YET. Tim: SHE CAME BY YESTERDAY TO SAY GOOD-BYE. YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK HER MOM'S HOUSE, EH? YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT A FIGHT? UH... YEAH, I MEAN, WELL... NATALIE TOLD RAND THAT SHE WAS PREGNANT, AND RAND WAS REALLY DRUNK, AND HE GOT VERY UPSET. HE THOUGHT IT WASN'T HIS, SO HE PUSHED HER, AND SHE FELL DOWN. CHRIS TRIED TO BREAK IT UP. REALLY? YEAH, WELL, I GUESS SO, BUT-- YOU SHOULDN'T PUSH GIRLS AROUND, SIR. ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE PREGNANT, GUYS. YEAH, WELL, YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN MY BOY JUMP RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FRAY-- BA-KOW! BAM! WOULD'VE TAKEN HIM, TOO, IF RAND DIDN'T COLD-COCK HIM. IT WAS NOTHING AT ALL. I ASSUME THERE WERE WITNESSES. OH, YEAH. THE WHOLE PARTY SAW IT. RAND HAD NO RIGHT TO EMBARRASS YOU LIKE THAT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE. HE DIDN'T EMBARRASS ME. THEN WHAT HAPPENED? WELL, HE--HE LEFT. I MEAN, THAT'S THE LAST I SAW HIM. YEAH, BUT YOU WENT RUNNING RIGHT AFTER HIM TO-- OH. FORGET SOMETHING? NO, NO. NOT REALLY. I MEAN, IT'S NO BIG DEAL. I MEAN, I RAN AFTER HIM, AND HE WAS GONE. LIKE I SAID, THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM WAS AT THE PARTY. HOW SOON AFTER RAND LEFT DID YOU GO AFTER HIM? MY BOY WENT LOOKING TO KICK SOME ASS. RIGHT AFTER. RIGHT AFTER? BUT YOU DIDN'T SEE HIM? WAS RAND ON THE TRACK TEAM? HE JUST VANISHED? MAYBE HE WAS ABDUCTED BY SOME FUCKING ALIENS. OK, MAYBE IT WASN'T RIGHT AFTER, BUT-- TIM, YOU WERE THERE. I MEAN, I PROBABLY TOOK A MINUTE OR TWO TO MAKE SURE NATALIE WAS OK. WELL, WHICH WAS IT? RIGHT AFTER? ONE MINUTE? TWO MINUTES? WHAT? I--I DON'T--YOU KNOW, IT WAS PROBABLY A MINUTE. DID YOU GO UP TO THE DELL THAT NIGHT? NO. NO. YOU SURE? YOU SEEM TO BE HAVING A LAPSITATION OF MEMORY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THEM, BUDDY. EXCUSE ME? HEY, I DON'T MIND TELLING THEM ANYTHING. HE HAS HIS RIGHTS. HE SHOULD HAVE HIS LAWYER PRESENT. WELL, WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT... COUNSELOR. OH, I ALMOST FORGOT. IS THIS NATALIE? THAT--THAT IS NATALIE RIGHT TH-- I'M SORRY. WHERE DO YOU... WHERE'D YOU GET THAT PICTURE? WE FISHED IT OUT OF THE RIVER THIS MORNING. IT WAS PROBABLY ON YOUR BUDDY. Tim: HEY... THIS IS DONE, RIGHT? BUT I GOT TO GET ACROSS CAMPUS FOR A CLASS. YOU GUYS MIND JUST POPPING ME OVER THERE? YEAH, SURE. COME WITH US. I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT CHRIS. WE ALL ARE. I MEAN... FIRST, THIS WHOLE THING WITH GETTING WAIT-LISTED AT HARVARD. HE'S COMPLETELY OBSESSIVE ABOUT IT. AND NOW WITH RAND, I MEAN... I REALLY WANT TO HELP HIM THROUGH IT, BUT HE WON'T EVEN TALK WITH ME ABOUT IT. WELL, AT LEAST HE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE WHOLE WAIT-LIST THING ANYMORE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? HE DIDN'T TELL YOU? TELL ME WHAT? ABOUT THE 4.0. IF YOUR ROOMMATE COMMITS SUICIDE, YOU GET AN AUTOMATIC 4.0 FOR THE SEMESTER. HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING? I THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST A MYTH. SO DID I, UNTIL THEY OFFERED IT TO ME. SO CHRIS TOOK IT? WOW. THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE HIM. DID HE EVER TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS WHOLE 4.0 THING BEFORE? UH... I DON'T KNOW. HE MAY HAVE MENTIONED IT A LONG TIME AGO. BEFORE RAND KILLED HIMSELF? OK, IF HE DID MENTION IT, HE WAS COMPLETELY JOKING. WHAT'S YOUR POINT? JUST-- JUST TRY AND FOLLOW ME ON THIS, ALL RIGHT? HIS WHOLE LIFE, ALL CHRIS HAS EVER WANTED WAS TO GET INTO HARVARD. THEN, HIS GRADES, THEY SUCKED THIS SEMESTER. HE STARTS JOKING ABOUT THIS WHOLE 4.0 DEAD MAN'S CURVE THING. "HEY, KILL YOURSELF, SO I CAN GET INTO GRAD SCHOOL." THAT NIGHT AT THE PARTY, RAND POPPED HIM IN THE FACE IN FRONT OF, LIKE, HALF THE CAMPUS. RAND TOOK OFF. CHRIS TOOK OFF RIGHT AFTER HIM. THE NEXT MORNING, WE WAKE UP. RAND'S DEAD, AND CHRIS HAS GOT HIS TICKET INTO HARVARD. Emma: YOU ARE SO FULL OF SHIT, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO, BUT HE'S YOUR BEST FUCKING FRIEND. IT MAKES SENSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. [EMMA LEAVES] GOD. EMMA. Chris: HAVE YOU HEARD FROM NATALIE? Emma: NO. THIS WHOLE RAND THING HAS GOT ME REALLY FUCKED UP. CHRIS, WHY CAN'T YOU TALK TO ME? IS THIS ABOUT THAT WHOLE 4.0 THING? HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT? DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THAT? NO. I DIDN'T TELL ANYONE. DID TIM TELL YOU? HE'S THE ONLY ONE THAT KNOWS. I DON'T TALK TO TIM. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE THE 4.0? WHAT WOULD YOU DO? WELL, I'M ASKING YOU. I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING ANYMORE. LOOK, IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THE 4.0 BECAUSE RAND KILLED HIMSELF, FINE, TAKE IT. I'LL STILL LOVE YOU. I JUST... MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T BE SO STRESSED OUT IF YOU DIDN'T TAKE IT. I MEAN, HARVARD'S NOT THE END-ALL. THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER GOOD SCHOOLS WILLING TO TAKE YOU AS YOUR GRADES ARE. THERE IS NO OTHER SCHOOL. IT'S EITHER AN MBA FROM HARVARD, OR YOU'RE FLIPPING BURGERS. CHRIS, LET ME HELP YOU. GOD, DON'T YOU TRUST ME? THERE'S JUST A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON THAT YOU SHOULD NOT BE INVOLVED IN. I NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUT ON MY OWN. YEAH. WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT? THAT'D BE SO GREAT. I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU ANYMORE. JUST GO. I WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING SOON, I PROMISE. YOU'LL UNDERSTAND-- ALL OF IT. GO. LEAVE. YOU FIND SOMETHING ELSE? Amato: OH, YEAH. WHAT DO YOU GOT? Amato: THE GIRLFRIEND?

I SAW THIS, UH, THIS COMIC ON MTV. HE WAS DOING THIS BIT ON HOW YOU COULD GET A 4.0 IF YOUR ROOMMATE COMMITTED SUICIDE. IT WAS JUST-- IT WAS A JOKE. YOU KNOW, HOW EASY IT WOULD BE. WRITE A SUICIDE NOTE AND PUSH HIM OFF A CLIFF AND BUY A FEW SMITHS CDs. IT WAS JUST A FUCKING JOKE. BUT YOU DID IT? YEAH. YEAH, WE DID. OH, MY GOD. LOOK, I NEVER MEANT FOR ANY OF THIS TO HAPPEN. CHRIS, TIM IS SETTING YOU UP. WHAT? ARE YOU BLIND? HE'S TRYING TO MAKE EVERYONE THINK THAT YOU KILLED RAND. TIM WOULD NOT DO THAT TO ME. NO, BUT HE WOULD SEDUCE YOUR GIRLFRIEND AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU SEE IT? HE'S GONNA MAKE YOU TAKE THE FALL. WHY WOULD HE DO THAT? WHO CARES, CHRIS? MAYBE HE WANTS TO SCREW YOU BEFORE YOU SCREW HIM, OR HE'S JUST A FUCKING PSYCHO. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. WE? DO YOU TRUST ME? TIM WAS REALLY ANGRY AND UPSET. HE THOUGHT IT WAS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION. WHAT ABOUT CHRIS? WELL, ACTUALLY, I DON'T REMEMBER HIM SAYING MUCH AT ALL ABOUT IT. YOU MIND ME SMOKING? I'D RATHER YOU NOT. DID CHRIS SEEM SURPRISED, SHOCKED? NO. IT WAS MORE LIKE HE WAS RESIGNED TO THE FACT. MAYBE LIKE HE ALREADY KNEW IT? HMM. MAYBE. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? WALKING AROUND. HEY, WHAT'S WITH THE GUN? WE NEED TO TALK. NO, WE DON'T. PUT DOWN THE GUN. THIS? IT'S NOT LOADED. I REALLY FUCKED UP, CHRIS. I KNOW WHAT YOU MUST BE THINKING. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M THINKING. I CAN EXPLAIN. I CAN EXPLAIN EVERYTHING. REMEMBER THAT STORY I TOLD YOU ABOUT RAND? THE PROM, THE HOOKER? YEAH? SO? IT WASN'T RAND. IT WAS ME. I DID THAT. BUT SEE, WHAT I DIDN'T TELL YOU, IS SHE CAME CRAWLING BACK TO ME A WEEK LATER. I WAS JUST TESTING HER. I LIKE TO DO THAT. I LIKE TO PUSH PEOPLE. SEE HOW MUCH I CAN GET AWAY WITH AND STILL HAVE THEM WANT TO BE MY FRIEND. RAND WAS YOUR FRIEND. I FUCKING HATED RAND. HE WAS MEAN TO EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW HE ALWAYS HATED YOU. "SCHOLARSHIP BOY." EVERYTHING WAS ALWAYS HANDED TO RAND AND I. WE HAD MONEY, DUDE. WE HAD CASH. CHICKS. GRADES. AND THEN YOU COME ALONG. AND YOU DO ALMOST AS WELL AS US, MAYBE EVEN BETTER, AND THAT DROVE RAND CRAZY. YOU COME FROM NOTHING AND DO BETTER THAN US? OH, MY GOD. I DIDN'T CARE. I DIDN'T CARE. HE USED TO JOKE ALL THE TIME ABOUT HOW EASY IT WOULD BE TO GET YOU... TO KILL YOURSELF... SO THAT HE WOULD GET A 4.0. SO THAT WE--HIM AND I... WOULD BOTH GET 4.0. ISN'T IT IRONIC? DON'T YOU THINK? A LITTLE? YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER TRUSTED ANYBODY IN MY WHOLE LIFE. I'M JUST A CASUALTY OF THE UPPER CLASS, AND THEN THIS THING COMES ALONG, THAT COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY RELIES ON US TRUSTING EACH OTHER. AND YOU TRUST ME, AND I, DUDE, I TOTALLY, COMPLETELY GIVE YOU ALL MY TRUST. I NEVER HAD ANYBODY LIKE THAT IN MY LIFE. AND SEE THAT'S WHY-- THAT'S WHY I KEPT PUSHING YOU, AND YOU STUCK WITH ME ALL THE WAY TO THE END. GOD. I'VE NEVER HAD ANYBODY LIKE THAT IN MY LIFE. WHY EMMA? WELL... I DIDN'T DO IT TO HURT YOU. DON'T YOU SEE? IT WAS A TEST. I MEAN, THAT, MAN, WAS JUST THE FINAL TEST OF OUR FRIENDSHIP. YOU ARE REALLY SICK. I KNOW. I KNOW, AND I'M SORRY. SEE, I'VE NEVER HAD A REAL FRIEND BEFORE. WHY CAN'T I EVER BE HAPPY WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE? YOU KNOW WHY? IT'S 'CAUSE OF MY DAD-- LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS. NO, NO, SEE, I DON'T THINK... YOU UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION HERE! I--GOD! I'M TIRED. I JUST CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? THERE'S A SITUATION HERE. THEY CAN'T FIND RAND'S BODY! GOD DAMN IT! YOU WANNA GO TO HARVARD? YOU WANT A 4.0. I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A FUCKIN' 4-0. TIM. GIVE ME THE GUN. IT'S OK. IT'S OK. WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. YOU KNOW, USED TO BE... THAT ALL YOU NEEDED TO GET A GOOD JOB IN THIS COUNTRY WAS A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. NO, SIR. THEN YOU HAD TO HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE. NOT GOOD ENOUGH. THEN IT WAS A MASTER'S. HELL, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU CAN GET AFTER THAT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE BOTTOM LINE IS, FELLAS? I MEAN, THE REAL BOTTOM LINE-- WHAT THE LIBERAL MEDIA WILL NOT TELL YOU. THE HUMAN BRAIN... WEIGHS THE SAME TODAY AS IT DID 150 YEARS AGO. MAKES YOU THINK, HUH? HERE'S OUR BOY. Shipper: HOW YOU DOING, MR. MASON? DETECTIVES. WHERE YOU GOING IN SUCH A HURRY? GOT FINALS TO GET TO. WELL, IT CAN WAIT. WE NEED TO TALK. Amato: YOU WANNA TAKE A RIDE IN THE CAR? WHAT, IN THIS? NO, I'M FINE HERE. I'LL BE HONEST, CHRIS, ALL RIGHT? I THINK-- NO. CORRECTION. I KNOW YOU HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH RAND'S DEATH. EXCUSE ME. HAVE THEY FOUND THE BODY? NO. SO IT'S NOT A DEATH. IT'S A MISSING PERSON. Shipper: WHY DID YOU TELL US ALL THOSE DEPRESSING BOOKS, VIDEOS, AND CDs WERE RAND'S? HEY, LISTEN TO ME, I GOT 3 STORE FUCKIN' CLERKS SAYS YOU BOUGHT THE MOTHERFUCKERS. WE GOT RECEIPTS, ONE WITH YOUR BANK CARD. NOW HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT? HE'S CLEAN. TIM RAN OUT OF CASH, AND HIS CREDIT CARD GOT REJECTED, SO I PAID FOR EVERYTHING. DO NOT LIE TO HIM. TIM RAN OUT OF CASH? HIS FATHER OWNS HALF THIS STATE. GIVE ME A FUCKING BREAK. HEY, IT'S THE TRUTH. WHY DON'T YOU GO QUESTION TIM? WHAT ABOUT THE PARTY? TIM SAID YOU RAN AFTER RAND AND NO ONE SAW YOU AGAIN. HE WAS LYING. WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS FRENCH GIRLIE? SHE'S NOT FRENCH, SHE'S CANADIAN. WHAT THE FUCK IS THE DIFFERENCE? SHE'S FRENCH CANADIAN. WHAT DO I CARE? SHE'S FROM TORONTO. ALL YOUR FRIENDS SEEM LIKE THEY'RE COMMITTING SUICIDE. I WOULD GET A LITTLE BIT OF A COMPLEX WITH THAT. WHAT DID YOU DO WITH RAND'S BODY? DID YOU CUT HIM UP INTO LITTLE FUCKING PIECES? YOU SEE A SHRINK? HMM. AREN'T WE ALL? Ernie: CUT HER UP? THAT SHRINK MUST KNOW SOMETHING. OR MAYBE YOU FUCKING CONFESSED TO HER. YOU'RE PRETTY SET ON GETTING INTO HARVARD, AREN'T YOU? WELL, IT HAS CROSSED MY MIND. WHY, ARE YOU GENTLEMEN ALUMNI? THAT'S REAL FUCKIN' FUNNY, IDIOT. DO YOU SMOKE? ARE YOU GUYS CONCERNED ABOUT MY HEALTH NOW? YEAH, WELL, HEY, IS THIS YOURS? YOU MISS THE FUCKIN' LIGHTER? WE FOUND IT AT THE CLIFF. WHY DID YOU TELL ME THAT RAND WAS UPSET ABOUT NATALIE BEING PREGNANT? WE DID AN AUTOPSY. NATALIE WAS NOT PREGNANT. LOOK, ARE YOU GUYS GONNA ARREST ME? NO. BUT AS SOON AS WE FIND THAT BODY WE WILL. RIGHT. WHAT, ARE YOU A TOUGH GUY ALL OF A SUDDEN? ARE YOU A SMART GUY ALL OF A SUDDEN? YOU LITTLE FUCKIN' PUNK! YOU FUCKIN' PUNK! GIVE ME PIMPS, PROSTITUTES, ANYBODY! YOU COLLEGE KIDS... YOU KIDS ARE THE SCUM OF THE EARTH, MAN! Shipper: JUST RELAX, ALL RIGHT? LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. AH, THAT FUCKIN' PIECE OF SHIT. EMMA. EMMA. CHRIS. DID YOU BRING THE TAPE? YEAH. WHY ARE WE MEETING OUT HERE? YOU HAVE IT? HERE IT IS. AND IT HAS EVERYTHING ON IT, RIGHT? YES. "TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN... "I, BEING OF SOUND MIND, "BUT BROKEN SPIRIT... "HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE MY OWN LIFE. "THERE'S NO ONE TO BLAME BUT A SOCIETY... "THAT HAS PUSHED ITS YOUTH TOO HARD AND TOO FAST "WITHOUT EVER GIVING THEM A PARACHUTE... IF THEY FAIL." I'M SORRY. Emma: BE CAREFUL WHO YOU TRUST, CHRIS. LET'S FACE THE FACTS. CHRIS, YOUR GAME IS OVER. YOU HAVE ONE CHOICE LEFT. YOU GO OUT LIKE A MAN OR A BIG, FAT GIRL. IF I WERE YOU... I'D TRY TO SNAG SOME DIGNITY OUT OF THIS WHOLE THING. YOU WANT ME TO KILL MYSELF, HUH? RAND WASN'T ENOUGH FOR YOU? WOULD'VE BEEN IF WE EVER FOUND THE BODY. BUT SEMESTER'S COMING TOWARDS AN END, GRADES ARE RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. I HAD TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE. YOU CAN RESPECT THAT, RIGHT? EMMA DOES. HEY, TIM. WE ARE ALL GRADUATING TOGETHER... IN PRISON. IT WASN'T ME. IT WAS ALL HER IDEA. CHRIS, WHAT DID WE DO? WE KILLED RAND. AND NATALIE. I'M GONNA TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY ACTIONS. WHY'D YOU WANT TO KILL YOURSELF? I WAS DEPRESSED. THE WHOLE THING WITH NATALIE. MY GRADES SUCKED. JUST FELT LIKE MY LIFE WAS CRUMBLING IN FRONT OF ME. YOU THOUGHT KILLING YOURSELF WOULD SOLVE ALL YOUR PROBLEMS? I DON'T KNOW. I WENT BACK TO THE DORM AND WROTE THAT NOTE. GUESS I JUST WANTED EVERYBODY TO FEEL SORRY FOR ME. I SWEAR I NEVER KNEW ALL THAT SHIT WAS GOING TO-- WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT AT THE DELL? [SIGHS] WELL... LIKE I SAID, I WAS DRUNK. I HAD THIS BIG FIGHT WITH NATALIE. I HIT CHRIS. I KNOW THIS IS HARD FOR YOU. THANK YOU. Rand: ANYWAY... THERE I WAS, ALL BY MYSELF ON THE CLIFF. I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER WALKING THERE. I HAD PUT THE NOTE IN THE BOTTLE. I SAW YOU GO OVER THE CLIFF. DID YOU? Rand: THEN I STARTED TO THINK ABOUT MY PARENTS AND MY FRIENDS. I MEAN, HERE I WAS ABOUT TO KILL MYSELF. I KNOW I HAD PROBLEMS... BUT DID I REALLY NEED TO JUMP? STOP. I SWEAR I'LL SHOOT YOU. Dr. Ashley: WHAT'D YOU DO NEXT? HITCHED A RIDE-- DOWNTOWN, TO THE BUS STATION. I ACTED LIKE SUCH AN ASSHOLE AT THAT PARTY. COULDN'T FACE MY FRIENDS AFTER THAT. WHERE'D YOU GO? I MADE MY WAY DOWN TO WEST PALM BEACH. I HAVE SOME FRIENDS DOWN THERE. I JUST HUNG OUT. I ALWAYS PLANNED ON COMING BACK. YOU LEFT THE SUICIDE NOTE BEHIND. I'M... I'M SUCH AN IDIOT. I TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT IT. I WAS WASTED. I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED. FIRST NATALIE... ONE MORE STEP, AND I'LL SHOOT ALL OF YOU. YOU DON'T WANNA DO THAT. CHRIS, PUT THE GUN DOWN. HEY, CHRIS, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? LOOK AT YOUR LIFE. YOU'RE NOT GETTING INTO HARVARD. I'M FUCKING YOUR GIRLFRIEND. YOUR ROOMMATE'S BEEN PLANNING YOUR DEATH ALL SEMESTER. HMM. IF I WERE YOU... I'D JUMP. AND THEN MY ROOMMATE... JESUS. I MUST BE CURSED. I KNOW, I KNOW. I... SHOULDN'T BLAME MYSELF. [RAND SIGHS] ONE MORE FUCKING STEP, AND I'LL SHOOT YOU. ONE? FUCK YOU. Tim: COME ON, YOU BIG GIRL. I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA SHOOT ME. WELL, SHOOT! WITH FRIENDS LIKE YOU... WHO WANTS TO LIVE. [ALARM RINGING] [ALARM STOPS] I'LL TELL YOU THE REST LATER. NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT. I'VE GOT A FEW MORE MINUTES. WHY DON'T WE SEE THIS THROUGH TO THE END? IT FIGURES YOU'D SHOOT BLANKS. [TIM CHUCKLES] THAT'S COLD. WELL, MUCHACHO... [CLICKING TONGUE] LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE RUN OUTTA OPTIONS. WELL, I MIGHT-- I MIGHT HAVE ONE LEFT. REALLY? WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? LOADING BULLETS INTO THE GUN. HEY, RAND, HOW WAS WEST PALM BEACH? UNSEASONABLY COLD. I TOLD YOU. YOU SHOULD'VE GONE TO LAS VEGAS. [COCKS HAMMER] I DON'T LIKE TO GAMBLE. WAIT A MINUTE. YOU... YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME. [LAUGHING] I'M REALLY GONNA MISS THAT GUY. YOU KNOW, THIS ISN'T PERSONAL. IT'S JUST BUSINESS. HOLD ON A MINUTE. THIS IS NOT HAPPENING. NOBODY EVER LIKED YOU ANYWAY. I GUESS NOW WE'RE REALLY GONNA SEE HOW FAR YOU CAN PUSH PEOPLE. [CLICKING TONGUE] OH... I ALMOST FORGOT. YOUR SUICIDE NOTE. HARVARD'S REALLY NOT GONNA BE THE SAME WITHOUT YOU. YEAH, WE'LL DEDICATE A WING TO YOU IN THE PSYCHE DEPARTMENT, YOU SICK FUCK. [SNICKERS] THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK. YOU CAN'T SHOOT ME. YOU MORONS. IT'S GOTTA LOOK LIKE A SUICIDE. OH, FUCK! HE'S RIGHT. AAAAH! [THUMP] [SPLASH] HEY, EMMA. OH, MY GOD. ARE YOU IN... OR ARE YOU OUT? I ASSUME THE CHANCELLOR ALREADY TOLD YOU ABOUT YOUR OPTION OF TAKING THE 4.0. YEAH. IT'S WEIRD. EVERYBODY THINKS I KILLED MYSELF AND NOW I GET A 4.0. WELL... YOUR ROOMMATE DID COMMIT SUICIDE. SINCE YOU WERE NEVER LEGALLY DECLARED DEAD, YOU'RE STILL A REGISTERED STUDENT. I DIDN'T WANNA TAKE IT. CHRIS AND I TALKED ABOUT IT FOR A LONG TIME. IT DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TIM'S DEATH LIKE THAT. WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND? WE TALKED TO EMMA. YOU KNOW, NATALIE'S ROOMMATE? EMMA TOOK THE 4-0. Shipper: WE DID AN AUTOPSY. NATALIE WAS NOT PREGNANT. Rand: SHE EXPLAINED TO US THAT IT'S WHAT TIM WOULD HAVE WANTED. Rand: YOU KNOW? FOR ALL OF US TO GO TO HARVARD GRAD. TOGETHER. LIKE HE ALWAYS DREAMED OF. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA GET YOUR MASTER'S IN? I'M THINKING ABOUT... DRAMA.
