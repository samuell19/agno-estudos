HD Presentation The digitization and restoration of this film remain faithful to the body and spirit of the original work. They have been made possible by funding from the original 124-minute version of Kamouraska opened March 29, 1973 at the Cinema Saint-Denis in Montreal. Ten years later, Claude Jutras began re-editing his film to make a 173-minute version on video for television. The Quebec Film Lidrary has reconstructed this version from the original footage it held in its archive. This copy was restored in 1995 for the Centennial of Filmmaking with financial assistance from AstralTech Inc. and Telefilm Canada. Screenplay based on the novel by Anne Hebert, Edition du Seuil My only, my deadly love. Elisabeth... Why didn't you have the eaves trough fixed? I can't sleep with that noise. It's unbearable. Jerome, do you hear that? What? That wagon. You're dreaming, my poor Elisabeth. It's the eaves trough. I should sew this button back on. You should worry about the eaves. Just one man. Be beautiful for him forever. Above all, never grow old. And you, Monsieur Roland, are afraid. Why? You've such an admirable wife! Kind, devoted, irreproachable. Call Florida. Please, get Florida. The sugar, my drops... Call Florida. - Call Florida! - It's 2:30, she's asleep. Wake her up. I want her to come right away. Shall I read to you? No, the other one. "Liturgical poetry." Not there. Where the bookmark is. "Day of anger. On this day, the hearts of men will be known. Nothing unavenged shall remain." Is that all? My eyes hurt. Give nothing of oneself; receive nothing. May spouses remain strangers forever, amen. Why are you smiling? It's nothing. Nerves. It's time for my drops. Call Florida! Sugar... my drops... I'll go get the sugar. Quickly! Go quickly! Hurry, driver! We must cross the border! Faster! There's no sugar! Where is it? Florida! What have you done with it? I'm an accomplice. I'm sure of it. Madam, I regret to say we have a warrant for your arrest. Here it is. I have it. I'm coming. Jerome? There you are. Finally. Anything but an accomplice to death again. Calm down! - Count with me. Hurry. One, two, three, four... Arrested! Imprisoned! Interrogated! Investigated! Then released. Free again, to pay dearly for my false freedom. From one prison to another, paying penance forever. There's a wagon out front. Visitors. I'm frightened. See? They're leaving. What was the name... of that girl with the pipe? What girl? You know... Aurelie Caro. What are you on about? Yes, Aurelie Caro. Time to freshen up! Good morning, Madam. Monsieur Jerome. Goodness. What a racket on market day! I'll buy some chamomile and cherry stems. Sleep well? Let's get cleaned up. Then I'll bring the bedpan, all right? Get some sleep, Madam. I'll take care of things. Hear ye, hear ye! The Monsieur is dying. Madam is killing herself! Hear ye! Monsieur is dying! Madam is murdering herself! Monsieur is dying! Madam is murdering herself! Little Albert's very sad. He can't find his kitten. He searched the house, the yard. No luck. He'll have forgotten by tonight. Besides, it'll probably show up. My poor mama! What are you doing there? Is Papa asleep? Florida's looking after him. Are the children up? Let me straighten your hair. It's a mess! I need to rest. Let me fix your hair. Anne-Marie, leave me alone. Let me do your hair. At her Majety's court the iurors for our Lady the Queen present that Elisabeth Eleonore d'Aulnieres late of the parish of Kamouraska, in the district of Quebec, wife of one Antoine Tassy, on the fourth day of junuary in the second year of the reign of our Queen Lady Victoria, by the grace of God of the united kingdom at the parish aforesaid, in the country aforesaid, wilfully, malicously and unlawfully, did mix deadly poison, and unlawfully kill and murder the said Antoine Tassy, agaist the peace of our Lady the Queen, her crown and dignity. I think that's the doctor. It's important not to tire yourself. If I can, I'll come by tonight. Goodbye. There's not much I can do. He may pass on at any moment. I'll stay by his side till the very end. You need rest. You're exhausted. All these sleepless nights! How do you expect me to sleep? You must. I prepared this medication just for you. Take the powder with water. Rest, or you won't make it. - Promise? - Yes. That's better. Goodbye. I'll come again tonight. Goodbye. Florida? Oh, it's you. You should get some sleep. Call Florida. I'm here. Everything'll be fine. You were lucky to marry me. Don't you think? If I hadn't been there to save your honour when you got out of prison... I was free without you. Free. I was rebuilding my life. Accomplice in the murder of my first husband: the infamous sacrifice at Kamouraska Cove committed by George Nelson, my love and justice. Forced into remarriage with you. The perfect wife all these years. Wifely duty nightly till your heart failed. Now, I resume my place at death's door. That flower's so bright. This evening's so calm. Life fresh milk. Ace of hearts: a love letter. Queen of diamonds: Elisabeth, my only child, blonde and radiant in the light. Your cards are fixed, Mama. That girl has a bad reputation! - Yes. She should be dismissed. - Yes! Pudding as you like it! Chocolate, and no lumps. Not so loud. What time is it? You're a good woman. It's eight o'clock. And the children? Out with Agatha, so they won't bother Monsieur. I'll be in my room. Fetch me if anyone comes. Guilty. I am guilty! "O clemence, o pia o dulcis..." - You're distracted! - I want to go! - Bass fishing with the boys! - We'll finish "the Salve Regina"! "O dulcis, Virgo Maria". - Sometimes I worry about her. - Her life is before her. The last three invocations again. "O pia, o dulcis, Virgo Maria". Hello, Aurelie. Hello. How old are you? - Fifteen. And you? - Me too. Florida? Florida, the drapes! Close the drapes. The light's too bright. You're so pale, Aurelie. I always had a prisoner's complexion, Madam. A real omen. Why call me "Madam"? We're little girls. Two innocent girls. - I was never innocent! Neither were you, Madam. I spent two and a half years in prison because of you. At the Court's discretion, as they say. While Madam is free on bail. I went to prison too. Two months. Two months for me, Elisabeth d'Aulnieres. You forget? I forget nothing. Nothing at all. There was no trial. Charges were withdrawn. Withdrawn. You know that. Withdrawn? To hell with the judges and witnesses. The journalists... Madame is saved, and so am I. Free! We're both free. Yes. Remember, Aurelie. You're 15. They used to call you "Mademoiselle". You may be well dressed, but you know nothing about boys! This is nothing! You should see my ball gown. All silk... low-cut... to dance at the Governor's! - Oh, yeah? I live at my uncle's. - They say he's not your uncle. He supports me well. Aurelie, are you really a witch? I can tell if a newborn will survive. I lick them, head to toe. Too salty means they'll die. Tell me about boys! It's true! Mothers call me just to find out. I want to know about boys! Little pigs in their Sunday best. Excuse me, it's the witching hour. Mustn't be late. - Ready. - Aren't you pretty! Good thing for the governor's ball! Just need a Prince Charming. Goodness, we'll have to find her a husband! Ladies and gentlemen, the governor! Let the ball begin! - You're very pretty. - Thank you. - Pretty enough to marry. - I may well do so. - I'm already taken, alas. - Alas. Shoot! Bravo! Nice shot. I always aim carefully. So do I. - Adelaide, Angelica! Wait! - Look at them! What a nice couple! Look! They're wonderful together! Help me, Antoine. Good day, Madam. I'm Antoine's mother. I'm Elisabeth's mother. Welcome. The long trip from Kamouraska to Sorel must be tiring. Dear Madam, back in Kamouraska, we cannot allow ourselves to tire. If we're tired, we pretend not to be. We're a very established family. Two hundred acres of land and forest; all the islands across from the seigniory. Since his father's death last year, my son, Antoine, has been seigneur of Kamouraska. In his name, I'm honoured to request your daughter's hand. Oh, Madam, you do us a great honour. - Would you like to dance? - Why not? You're aloof although you agreed. Me? No, my mother did. You're so pretty, how about a smile? Do you like that smile? I saw you with her last night. What an insult. I didn't know. Forgive me. Look at me. I asked forgiveness. Will you grant it? - Well? - Yes! Elisabeth d'Aulnieres, do you take Antoine Tassy as your husband? I do. I declare you husband and wife. Bon voyage, child! Write soon! Bravo! Long live the bride! Lots of happiness! Isn't she pretty! Long live the newlyweds! Montmagny, Berthier, Islet, Saint-Jean-Port-Joli, Saint-Anne... To Kamouraska! To Kamouraska! To Kamouraska... Voila. This is all mine. And yours. Ours. Even those islands. Kamouraska is famous for eels. Delicious. I'll get used to them, eating them every day. Or you'll just pretend, child. Your husband will help. Someone might see us. I love you. There. Put your arms out. Looks like an owl nailed to a barn door! Don't move. He'll have to be dressed warmly. Or she will be. He. We'll see. Be patient! He always comes home. My son's a good boy. But he gets into the party spirit sometimes. You should learn to keep distance from what upsets you. That's what those who enjoy life do. Mark my words. Tears and tantrums are nothing but theatrics. So then, I'm a woman of theatre. I'm not afraid of tears and tantrums. I'll take my folly to the limit. What do you think? You should do tapestry again. Yes. I was thinking that. I went to confession. The priest was a dead tree. "Father, I roll in filth. I speak obscenities. I'm debauched... grimacing... capering like a goat... leaping like a trout, grunting like a sow. Nothing but a clown... full of cognac, beer, caribou! Father, I descend into a black cave. I fall blind". You're a dead tree, full of broken branches. I want to see my idiotic face in the mirror. I'm afraid, Antoine! Antoine, I'm scared. What's wrong? You've been there for an hour, motionless, silent. Talk to me, please! Don't worry, it's gone on for five years. Just give him strong black coffee, and keep an eye on him so he won't do anything stupid. You're here! Come. Come on. You'll see. Man and wife, tired together. Isn't it sweet? Wait, I've an idea! You'll see. I'll make a cradle. It'll just drop. No need for a midwife. It'll drop into the straw like a stone. We'll hear its first cry. Before we die. Look. For better or for worse, no? Yeah... I'm a bastard, but don't look at me like that. Your navel's full of tears, like a holy water basin. You're beautiful, good, but someday, I'll kill you. - It's a boy! - The master had a son! - How about a toast? - Never mind Lent! - Admirable woman! - Good Christian. What a husband! - Did they use forceps? - I think so. I heard it lasted over 36 hours! The baby! My little stranger. I have a little gift. Poor thing, what's wrong? You're not happy. Where's Antoine? I don't know. I knitted this for him. It's a bit rough for a baby. This is all theatrics! Let the party begin! Let's toast my wife's health! Everyone but me, for I swore on my son's head I'd never drink again! My grandson is a crybaby! But my son is twice as bad! To the next seigneur of Kamouraska! You can't stay here any longer. We'll take you to Sorel. Your mother's expecting you. Eh, my child? Are you all right, child? Is it much further? Shall I ask the coachman? Oh, my god! Antoine's up there! Good Lord! Stop! Here I am. Carry on! - We're nearly there. - Finally. I feel fine! We'll keep going. Onward. To Sorel! Mama! Mama! Mama, did you scream? No, don't be silly. Are you ill? - Not at all! Don't get up. Too much devotion, and worry. Devotion... worry... Get some rest. - What's with the barricade? - My aunts did it. - What for? - To stop your visits. Can I come in? Where were you? You smell of drink... and whores. - Oh, my wife. How can you be... so beautiful and so mean? Who gave you this? This? Her name is... "Horse Marine"! Go! You disgust me! Let me be! Leave me alone! You're hurting me! - I'm sick. - What's wrong? I'm feverish. That's not an illness! I'm sick of you! Get some help! - I'll see a doctor. I'll find you one! Elisabeth, this is Doctor Nelson. An old college friend. Hello. Hello, Madam. Pleased to meet you. - Say "33". - Thirty-three. Louder, please. Thank you. Slight weakness in the chest due to difficulty after delivery. Have her drink a little fresh blood. Fresh blood? Yes. Nelson! You through examining my wife? What's that? I'm so unhappy! My daughter's on edge. Please excuse her. She bumped against some furniture in the house. How about a drink? Anti-social chess player! Why didn't you mention him? Nelson? Didn't know you'd be interested. He's a foreigner. Why would an American come to Lower Canada? He's from a good family. Loyalist. He does come to Mass on Sundays, but everyone knows he was Protestant. He lives in a shack, like a farmer. He never mixes with Sorel society. Quite a strange character. If I had a friend, it'd be him. Here, Aurelie. It's useless, I've no more milk. Doctor Nelson is an American devil. He curses women's breasts, like they poison streams! I'm tired. I'm going to bed. Oh, Elisabeth! Tonight you sleep I my room. I made your bed. You're sick. Your health overrides your conjugal duties. So the women decide now? I asked Ernest to guard the door. You, sir, will sleep in the guestroom. What's wrong, Auntie? Have you gone mad? Did you go to the doctor? Yes, Madame. At 3:00. I couldn't say so, Monsieur was there. - Did you see him? - No, he wasn't there. How could that be? His assistant told me. - What did he say? - Just that. I don't believe you. He's doing it on purpose. You've gone there twice. I haven't seen him once since he first came. He knows I need him. I'm sure he's doing it on purpose. Go back to his house. Tell him I'm sick. You must bring him back. Do you hear me? I'll go back if you want. Tomorrow. He surely has you under a spell. It's not easy with your husband here. It's hell. Bad luck. Yet it was a good match. Yes, for you and my mother. The son of a good family. A real scoundrel! Inside, he's very unhappy. Unhappy? With an adoring wife, a beautiful, healthy baby? He's the one who generates misery. What'll happen now? I don't know, Aunt. Time for bed. We'll discuss it tomorrow. I'll fix your bed. I thought I saw something but it's nothing. So go to bed. - Good night, child. - Good night. No, Monsieur! - You're not allowed! - I said, let me by! You don't want me but here I am. Good evening. You prefer that fat sow? Shame! Aren't you sleepy? Not very. - This bed's quite narrow. - Oh? Even better. Go away, Antoine. Go. Go away, sir! Go away, sir. Get out, get out! Go. Trollop! You don't want your husband? Monsieur Tassy! Is that what you want? You bunch of hens! Old, shrivelled asses! Who's your pretty ass for? I'll find one that isn't locked up! Goodbye, my wife! Slut for slut, I prefer those I pay! It's too cold! Take the baby back! And take a different road home. - Yes, Madame. Hello, Madame. I'll tell the doctor you're here. Have a seat. - Thank you. Don't cry. It'll be fine tomorrow. I just re-broke this boy's arm, to re-set it properly. Some quack had set it all wrong. The country's infested with charlatans. Ignorance, superstition, and squalor everywhere. Shameful! We must stop healers from killing people, force care on people, stop your servant, Aurelie, from playing the witch with newborns. Would you like to take off your coat? Do I appear odd to you, Madam Tassy? To what do I owe the honour of your visit? You came on Antoine's behalf? No. I'd tell you if I had. So no one sent you. You came on your own. Now that you've thoroughly examined me, I'll show you the house. Here's where I treat patients. Did Antoine tell you about me? That we played chess at college? He liked losing, I think. He never once won against me. I take his rook, his bishop... I'll take his queen. Doctor Nelson, I'm here. Won't you ask me how I am? How you are. That's all I ever think about. Why did you marry Antoine Tassy? You look much better now. You know I'm unhappy. I can't help you. I'm but a stranger here. So am I. Everywhere. With my husband, my son, in my own home. You don't mean it. Yes, I do. You have a country, a family. I've never had a friend! I liked playing chess with Antoine Tassy. Is that why you ride by my window at night? You recognized me. I wish I'd never known. You're afraid? Yes, of being found out. I always feel badgered here. That's what being a stranger means. You said "Elisabeth". It's the first time you've said my name. The mistakes one utters give one away. Saying "Bible" instead of "Gospels" gives one away. He who says "Elisabeth" rather than "Madam Tassy"... compromises himself and the woman he addresses. Your smile... Will you go to the ball on Sunday? Sunday? If you would kindly ride in my sleigh, I'd be the happiest man on earth. Your hair's so pretty! I'd sell my soul for hair like that. - What a do. - You're beautiful! This is so you can see yourself better. Don't touch the mirror! "Queenly stance, fervent heart, keen mind, limpid eyes. Flower in the hair, stinging spirit." - What's all this about? - Where are my aunts? I don't know. You're not going. I promised. I'm going. A wife and mother! Not any longer. Guests are gathering. I must go. - I'll take you. - No, I'm going with Doctor Nelson. - He already invited me. - You'll go with me! My husband came home. He forbade me to come. He punched me in the stomach. He hit you? Are you angry? Antoine's a very wicked man. Yes. All of us will go to hell. - I love you more than anything. - You are my life. - Is your cousin Henriette coming? - Henriette? You know she's too good for these things. Dance with me? You're too good. I want Henriette. Take advantage of the last ball before Ash Wednesday. Fasting won't do you any harm, Madam. Not sure you'll survive Lent, dear. - When will he start? - Soon. Mademoiselle, would you like to dance? - I don't know how. What do you mean? I showed you yesterday! You taught me to polka, this is a waltz. Just try! It'll be fine. Excuse me. Don't be afraid. Good evening, Madam. Excuse our tardiness. We lost our way and our sleigh tipped over. - Antoinette. What insouciance, child! Alone at night with the doctor. Your reputation! Here, drink this. Cinnamon and white wine. It'll warm you up. Do you like it? Best punch I've ever had! One lost, ten found. Not dancing? - Do something. This is awful. - All right. Leave me be. I'm a lout all right, but you, wife, are accursed. Don't wait for me. I'm going to drown myself. Easy to cut a hole in the ice and just fall in. Like into a well. I can't live after this. See what you find in the river next spring! Kiss my son for me. Fake drowning, false joy. Be wary of Antoine. I'd play along, pretend to cry, search and wait for his body. They can't drag the river till the ice melts in spring. Until then, I must live like a widow. He's been gone three weeks now. Should we search? No. Don't involve the police in family affairs. - Vespers already? - Yes! We're late, first time ever! Now we're forgetting essentials! Don't be afraid. Mother's sleeping, my aunts went out. We're alone here. What if someone walks in on us? I love you. - Warn me if someone comes. - Yes, Madam. Madame Marie d'Aulnieres, mother of the accused. Elisabeth was never alone in her room with Doctor Nelson. I was always there with her. Aurelie Caro, servant of the accused. I swear, she was often alone with him behind closed doors. whenever her mother went out. - It's Monsieur. - What? The Monsieur! - You're wrong. - I'm sure it's Monsieur Antoine! You know he drowned last month in a hole in the ice. Remember? This way, it's safer. Good God. Hurry! Come on! Hurry up, Aurelie! Go tell the doctor I'm here. Yes, Madame. Obedient Aurelie. Am I bothering you? Elisabeth, my patients. And us? - What's wrong? - It's always the same. Your house, my house, rushing, hiding... Your patients frighten me. Someday, fear will be our downfall. - What will become of us? - I'm here. What if Antoine came back? If he ever comes back to you, I swear I'll kill him. I think he's back. Here in Sorel. - Are you sure? - Yes. No. Aurelie saw him. That's not all. I'm pregnant. What's going on? It's Antoine! Elisabeth, come. It's Antoine. Elisabeth, it's Antoine! Come quickly! Go in there! Hello, Ernest! Put these up in my room. Draw me a hot bath with soap. I'm filthy. No, Monsieur! No one's home! Madam's away with the others, and the baby. Bald-faced lies. And bring the shaving kit. But, sir... What's he up to? Ernest's a fool. He shouldn't have let him in. Don't be afraid. We're all here. - I can't stand it. I feel sick. I stink! I smell like a pigsty. No, that's fine. Hand me the mirror. Disgusting. Pass the razor. Hooked nose... Horned brow... And to end my tale, a bit of tail. You know, Ernest... brothels... are like convents. You get over them. I was fed up with that bunch of floozies. They pamper me, fawn over me, rob me, rape me... They ruin me too! I'm crippled with debt. I'll sell some forest land, and go back to my mother's. I'm the seigneur of Kamouraska! First, I must make up with my wife. The scent of 'Horse Marine' is gone. I'm as clean as if I'd been to confession. - Go tell Madame. - I told you, she's out. Really? I think so. I don't think so. Elisabeth! Poor child! What a curse! On the contrary. It's a stroke of luck. Dear wife, you're there. Shall we make up? Yes, once and for all, let's put an end to this. George... Tell me about our child. It's a boy, I'm sure. You're a rich field for boys. And what is my son doing in my belly? - That's it! - It had to end this way. Elisabeth, shut up! Good Lord! Poor baby, what happened? My little girl. You realize you shall have no more dealings with us. You go back to Kamouraska. We'll see our notary. Physical and financial separation is the only solution. Elisabeth, my wife, you won't get away so easily. I'll be back. That's a promise. We could be taken for a real couple. Perhaps someday. Madam Nelson. Elisabeth Nelson. Madam. See? What are you thinking about? It's so nice with Antoine in Kamouraska. You know, the day he left... he came to the house. He was in his room. He called me. I went in. My aunts tried to stop me, but I went anyway. - Are you listening to me? - Elisabeth, please... let's not talk about your husband. If I could wipe him off the face of the earth, in a natural way, in an appropriate way... Yes... but how? A duel. He's too cowardly. What happens in a duel? Don't you know? - No. Tell me. Well... it could take place here. At dawn. We agree on the weapons. Pistols, for example, gleaming and weighty in the hand, the work of a skilled ironsmith. Who fires first? We fire together. Those are the rules! Witnesses arrive first. It's still dark. Then, the surgeon with his black box, full of scalpels and medicines. The adversaries arrive from opposite sides, in white shirts, to be conspicuous. I'll wear this one, and stand right here. Now... the sun comes up! We get ready. We stand, back to back, holding our pistols like this. We start together, we take 15 paces. I go this way, he goes that way. One, two, three, four, five... At the end, we both turn, and... Everyone peers through the smoke! It's him! Justice is done! It's my husband! You killed my husband! He's wounded! He's bleeding! His heart's still beating. - Hello. Hello! We killed him. What a relief! If only it were true. But duels are chancy. What if, by some misfortune, the bullet struck your heart, my love? Someday, though, we'll have to eliminate that chance. Elisabeth! Your gaze is so intense! We... must... kill... Antoine. That's between Antoine and me. In college, no boy was more miserable than Antoine Tassy. All I had to do was hold his head under water, squeeze, and wait for death to take effect. But now that he's taller, heavier, it'd be very difficult. I couldn't have done it anyway. Pity is foul. I was an unhappy child too. I pitied myself as much as him. We both would've had to die. I chose you, George Nelson. I want you to live, him to die. But I don't have the hands of a murderer. I cannot reassure you, my love. Paul Hus, 53, navigator. I was going home around 4:00 or 5:00pm. I saw Doctor Nelson appear with Madam Tassy, coming out of the pine grove. It seemed to me they'd been lying on the ground. They must have just stood up, or I'd have seen them. My dearest husband... your darling wife is writing... to inform you of a joyous occasion, in the month of... December, if calculations are correct. What a downpour. Poor Madam, you've been confined to the house. Not for long, Aurelie! This chore is almost finished. Look at the rain. Here. Give this to the postman early tomorrow. - Where to? - Kamouraska. For Monsieur? - Guess what it says. - I dunno. Goodness gracious, Madam! I wrote to say I'm expecting his child, though it's not really true. Oh, Madam! I must see the doctor right away. - Where's Adelaide? - Downstairs, cleaning. Good. Come with me. I need her key. Aunt Adelaide! We wish you a good evening. Shall we dance? I'm tired, I'm going to bed. Good night, Auntie. - I'm going to the doctor's. - You shouldn t. - No one can stop me! - So late? Doesn't matter, I've the key! Coming at this hour... How unwise! What difference does it make? I just wrote Antoine. I said I'm pregnant... by him. Him? Why would he believe you? He will, don't worry! What do you mean? I fixed things the day he left. Meaning? I slept with him! You did? I had to, George, to avoid suspicion. I don't mind antagonizing Antoine... but... there are certain feminine wiles that disgust me. You... with him... Evil... liar... I will never forgive you. I didn't want to-- You're mine. Elisabeth. Say it. - Say it loud! - I'm yours alone! The child too. The child... also. I beg your forgiveness! George, the lamp. Forget the lamp. Take off your dress. Your petticoats. Take everything off. Stand up straight. People can see in. Isn't that what you want? Tomorrow, everyone will know. We've nothing to lose. The lamp. Lie on the floor. Give me the key. Consider the family's honour, your children's future. I value my honour more than my life. How can you harbour such suspicion? You must be careful. Antoine sent a threatening letter. He says he's coming for you and his son. Antoine wrote? Yes. You kept it from me, and read it. You had no right. Give it to me. - I can't. - Why not? I burned it. Some letters must be burned, and some actions avoided, or else one will burn in hell. You so piously threaten hell. You seem to forget your soul. Because it's so very easy to do. God, the air is thick. I haven't slept a wink. How handsome Dr. Nelson is. So well bred! American, but from such a good Loyalist family. Too bad my child didn't meet him first. But he is the first. The first. There's never been anyone else and there never will be. May I smoke, Madam? Your affair with the doctor is killing me. It's even more amazing than you think. Here. Have some port. Thanks. Aurelie... I need you. You know Antoine's cruel. Well... you must go to Kamouraska... and poison him. That's a serious crime! No one will know! Aurelie... I'll keep you... here with me, like a sister, your whole life long, if you want. I'd be too scared of going to hell. Here, Aurelie. These are for you. All yours. Thank you. What are you doing? The embers show how your affair will end. Good Lord! So... you keep the barn door wide open? I knocked several times, but... since it was open, I took the risk and came up. Make yourself at home, Doctor. You're acting strange. What are you up to? Ask her! She's the witch. You're the real devil, Doctor! So... what's the plot? It's in the embers. What do they say? Let go, I want to leave! You can't just leave. Look me in the eye. We'll see if you're really a witch. I've never looked anyone in the eye, much less you. Please, sir, let me go! Dear Elisabeth. I can't go on this way. - I must go to Kamouraska. - No! Not before the birth. I'm afraid I won't survive the delivery. It's not worth it. Aurelie's going. We just discussed it. - I knew it! - She'll do it. - But I forbade you! - It's so far away, we don't even notice. No one will know what malady he died of. Madam Tassy... will write to inform us. It was bound to happen. One little binge too many... it's over for the seigneur of Kamouraska. We're bastards. We're innocent! Justice will be done. Aurelie... It's important you know everything, and handle everything, even if your simple soul can't comprehend, like real witches do. I am a real witch, sir. Well, I'm a joker. A real joker! That scoundrel, Tassy! I'll shoot him like a dog! Monsieur's such a joker, I'm telling you! Fire's going out. I can't revive it. We're too close to the fire. Lie back. There. That's right. I feel so good like this. If only you knew how good. Madam, what are you doing? Quiet, Aurelie. Close your eyes. Don't say a word. Little bird. Sleep, Aurelie. We'll make you dream like never before. You are now at the service of George Nelson, and it's as if you've joined a religion. My gosh. What are you gonna do to me? The dress. Now, open your eyes. Lovely! I'm so lovely! Like a real lady. I'm lovely. Like a real lady. I'd love to bed a real gentleman. And so you shall. You know Monsieur Tassy loves women. I am your new master. You shall do as I bid you. Let's go, sir. - Let me go. - Listen well. If you succeed in taking Tassy's life, you'll never have to work again. The entire rest of your life... in a room, sitting on a sofa, like a lady, in a red silk dress. That's false! There was no conspiracy between Nelson and my servant! I categorically deny this scene ever happened. Unless it was in a dream. Your poor mistress, her cruel husband. I can't apart from my love. I'll die. No one will ever know. You just pour the poison into brandy. Your loves are my downfall. After the first snowfalls, when the winter roads are cleared, you'll leave for Kamouraska. A few days later, Doctor Nelson called me to his office. He gave me 20 piastres for the trip, plus nine piastres for clothes. Then he gave me two small flasks. One contained half a pint of brandy. The other contained just over a glassful of whitish liquid. I mixed them together. When I packed my gunny sack, I hid the little bottle between two piles of clothes. I was away for three weeks. I'd like Aurelie to lick him and see if he tastes of life or death. What foolishness. Don't talk about it. Little witches have their uses, darling. Don't think about her. - She's away. Think of us. - Yes. - You are well. - Yes. And this boy seems to be enjoying life. Yes. Everything's in order. Yes. "Speed bonnie boat, like a bird on a wing, Onward, the sailors cry. Carry the lad that's born to be king Over the sea to Skye". "I saw three ships come sailing in, Sailing in, sailing in. I saw three ships come sailing in, On Christmas day in the morning". I saw Monsieur Tassy often at the Kamouraska inn. That day, he offered to take me to Saint-Pascal. He was already drunk. He forced me to kiss him. He showed me his empty flask. I had another in my bag. He drank, and was struck with pain. Then I ran. I left him for dead! He was dead! I'm telling you, silly girl, Monsieur Tassy's alive. Here's a letter from his mother! "Although he still makes merry occasionally, Antoine is well!" Merrymaking! I left him dead in the sleigh! He was dead! That man has nine lives. Like a cat. Rose Morin, by name, servant at the Kamouraska manor. On Thursday, Monsieur Tassy arrived home... in a terrible state! He was vomiting a lot. He was very ill until Sunday. Then he got better slowly. But for a long time, he looked... ashen. Very pale. I won't miss that bastard. Don't go. I beg you. You know I must. I'm determined. I told people I'm going to the States to see my ailing father. I must take all precautions. I'll try to pass unseen. I'll leave at dawn. He was wearing heavy socks. Leggings, perhaps, with small black buttons up the side and leather soles, as I recall. Mostly... dark blue. Like sailors wear. With... two side pockets at the hip. A grey wool overcoat, slightly white. It looked like the fabric seen in northern regions: usually whiter than what we weave here. I'll wear my grey wool coat. They won't recognize me. I know now why I exist. Man's business, to be settled man to man. The time of witches is past. Wicked Elisabeth, as you will. Fine weather, just as you predicted. But there, now, is the weather still fair? Where is he? Are the roads marked? Aurelie, say something. I'm very cold. Weather, roads... I don't know any more. It's too far... in a cursed country I wish I'd never known. I'm so afraid. You think I'm not? Why wear those rags? Can't find the new ones. You hid them. Only dreary colours suit me now. I'm sick. Think so? Did you take Communion? Did you? Cursed girl. Curse yourself and your husband. And that doctor's the king of demons. Shall I check your horse? Yeah, in weather like this-- Sir! Have you a piece of leather? Leather! To fix my harness! No leather, unfortunately. How about eel skin? - Eel? - That's what we use. You think it'll hold? Tuesday, January 29 at 9:00pm, a young foreigner arrived. I noticed the sleigh and horse. Never saw one like it. I'd know it anywhere. The harness... The harness had bells. The seat was set very high, the struts were fixed between the runners. The sleigh and its furs were black. Very noticeable. Hurry up! That'd better not break... This? Not a chance. Strong. I'll prove it. Have you a room? Good. I leave tomorrow at dawn. Montmagny, Saint-Jean-Port-Joli, Saint-Anne-de-la-Pocatiere, Riviere-Ouelle. Milk in your tea? Yes, please. Child's not well. Fever, I think. They say Dr. Nelson's gone to the States and his father's very ill. Yes, he's already been gone seven days. Hey, Monsieur! Is this the way to Kamouraska? Keep going. This road goes straight to Kamouraska. Good Lord! Adelaide! Elisabeth! The child's sick. Get some cold compresses and prepare her bed. Are you going far? To Saint-Andre. Spend the night here. No. Don't travel at night66 Night falls quickly here. You'll get lost. - How much do I owe you? - Have some pie! - I'm in a hurry. - Coffee? How much? Two shillings altogether. Which way's the Kamouraska manor? Nowhere near Saint-Andre. - Where is it? - By the point. You'll see it here. Go along the king's road, you'll see the manor drive. Is Seigneur Tassy there? Probably. His mother's there anyway. Go get my horse! Where's Antoine? He's in Kamouraska till spring. Calm down. What's he doing? He's very far away. Don't worry. He's waiting. He knows. I'm sure of it. He's waiting. Lying in wait. Hello, Antoine! You're here? What are you doing here? I come from Sorel with news of your wife. Where are you going? Get in the sled. It'll be easier to talk. As you wish. Then we'll dine at my house. Tell my mother we have a guest. I followed you as far as I could! I'm innocent! Innocent! That's the news from your wife in Sorel. Lord, the last rites... I'm... Bertrand Lampoignard. My brothers and I suddenly saw... Your Honour, we saw a sled coming towards us very fast! Going toward Kamouraska Cove. The driver was yelling. He'd put a fur on the floor of the sled. We thought we saw... another man, drunk, under the fur. Then we heard a plaintive groan coming from the sled. We were really horrified. Mama. Oh, yes. Attending my husband. That's far too many flowers. Just one spray for the ceremony. You have the crucifix? - Yes. I know. We're waiting for you. We also need two shallow bowls. One with holy water and a branch for sprinkling. Another with water. Plain water, and a towel so the priest can wash his hands. Mama, I need the keys. The keys? Hurry. We're waiting. Some cotton too. Cotton, for the last rites. Let's hope the witnesses don't show up... and compromise my marriage. Yes, I remember. There was a lot of blood! All along the jetty road. Here and there on the king's road too. By Monsieur Tassy's house, near Pincourt's. Right at the place where I saw, the night before, with my own eyes, a disoriented traveller, at Kamouraska Cove. Hey there! Stay there. Tell me where the king's road is. That's where I'm going! I'll come with you. Walk ahead of me, show me the way. Are we on the river, or on solid ground? We're still on ice, but beyond those sandbars, it's solid ground. We must hurry, the tide's rising! Walk! Clermon. Someone's knocking. Who is it? It's me! I need lodging. A stall and some oats for my horse. Hot water! I need hot water. Hot water, lots of it. That's not enough! I need more! So you need a lot! It's to wash my sled and furs. With all the nice white snow on our roads, how'd you manage to get them so dirty? Pass the water! Clean it up! My wife's old petticoat. It's freezing. We'll do it tomorrow. Covers! More covers! But it's warm in here. That's not enough. The fur. What fur? My sleigh fur! There! On the floor! Anything else? What are you doing? - It's the man who came before? - Yes. - Where you goin'? - He's handsome! I'll show you handsome. Go on. Go to bed! Sure. Goodness me, I sure married big. Quite a job. Could only get the worst out. I dunno how you picked up that mess. Only pigs would treat your things that way. You want breakfast? A glass of gin. Whatever. Let's go. Clermon. That guy killed someone. Stay calm, don't talk so much. But that guy killed someone! Maybe he's an English officer. He could get us. We're under a bad regime. Maybe there was fighting upriver. No doubt about it. He killed someone. Right? Am I not right, Madam? He killed someone! How dare you speak to me like that? I, Madam Rolange, am unimplicated. Sure, you know something. The whole south shore saw it. No! They mustn't talk. He asked me for a cognac sitting in his sleigh. He left without drinking it. He seemed foreign. Bad French, blood stains! He washed and changed. The water was red with blood! He ate nothing! He threw his belt in the fire, the house reeked! At Saint-Thomas they lost track of the sled and the big black horse. His hair, his beard, his eyes, and especially his gaze: black! He's the devil! I'm waiting for him. He's not back yet. Who? The doctor, of course. The priest is here. Monsieur's asking for you. Leave me, Florida. Do you need anything? I need sleep. I must finish my dream. That man did something extraordinary, superhuman, and he did it for me. I must be there for him. Let me sleep. There. It's done. Elisabeth, my woman, you're free now. We are free, both of us. Is anyone listening in the hall? No. Aurelie, stand watch. Listen, Elisabeth. I stood Antoine up on his feet to be sure he was really dead, and he was. Dead! As a doctor, I swear it's unnatural - so much blood in a human body. I'm sure that dog, Tassy, did it on purpose. I was all alone... with all that blood. Alone, all alone. Leave me alone! - The ammonia flask! - Let me be! - What flask? - It's on the dresser! Let me go. Open it! Under her nose! The police did it. But they were too late. The doctor left. This morning, at dawn. He left? He said he must leave the province. Never to return. I never saw a man in such despair. And...? That's about it. That's all? He also said... Have some coffee. It's bitter, and thick as molasses. I'm dishevelled. I'll straighten up. Give me some cologne. How can they accuse me so spuriously? Me! Elisabeth d'Aulnieres! Arrested! Jailed like a commoner with that crazy Aureie! Not so loud, or the governor won't let me stay with you. We'll get you out of here at all costs, you hear? But I ordered Aurelie to give false testimony. Damn her. My child! My child! Don't worry, I'll get you out. "Now they're looking after me. The workings of "good families" get into gear". I went to see the judge. He was very understanding. You are free, you realize that. Wave, my girl! They're greeting you. It's important they see us together. You'd do well to lift your veil. You're innocent. Let it show on your face and in your gestures. That's all that's asked, but it's imperative. You're condemned to innocence. Dead... I'm dead. And him... Him... Where is he? What's he doing? In the States. Gone. A letter. Just one letter from George, and I'd be saved. "In due course... you'll leave Canada. You'll come. Say you'll come, Elisabeth". Intercepted. His last letter, intercepted by the judge. What? Nothing. Madam is here. See how she loves Monsieur, and how she suffers? God bless you, my girl. Where were you? I had you summoned several times. I received my last rites. God has forgiven me all my sins. I'm so frightened. I'm here. Rest assured.
