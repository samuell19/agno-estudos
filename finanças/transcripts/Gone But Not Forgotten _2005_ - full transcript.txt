There's no other evidence linking him to any of the other victims. And his history of sex crimes comes down to one questionable incident of flashing. >> I just got a feeling about him. He can put the women in his delivery truck to drive them away. I mean, who'd look there? He works for a florist, he can get black roses easily. He's a florist delivery man, and he leaves behind his calling card, a black rose. It fits, right? >> No. Because nothing else about him fits.

Then he undermines all the mom and pop shops. You know, raises the rent, hits them with code violations, rezones, whatever, to, to degrade the neighborhood. Then, he appears like some sort of guardian angel, starts a big project, hypes the value, and sells before the construction is finished. Thereby reaping all of the rewards and passing on all of the headaches. >> Okay, we know he's not an angel. The question is, has he done anything that would make anyone hate him enough to want to frame him for murder? >> T-Baum, in general, in my experience, framing is something that doesn't really happen in real life.
