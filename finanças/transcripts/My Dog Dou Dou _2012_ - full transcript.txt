When I first laid eyes on Dou Dou, I knew he was mine. Mom, I want this dog. Dad is waiting, let's go. Today's my birthday. I want that dog. No, your dad hates dogs. Let's go. Mom, I want that dog. Can you hear me? Hello, honey. How are you? What do you want? Do you know I'm still helping you raise this stupid dog? Be quiet! Are you free? Let's meet. Give me one more chance. What do you want? Yes. Where are you? Can we meet? Give me one more chance. Can you please be quiet? If you continue barking, I'll skin you alive. No! I don't mean you! Goodness. Hello. What do you want? It's hard work caring for your dog. He keeps barking. Where are you? Can we meet? Give me my bag. If you want it, you'll have to crawl through here to get it. Raise. Raise to 28,000 dollars. Give me my bag! If you want it, you'll have to crawl through here to get it! You want to fight? Do you have that much money? Do we look like an ATM? You still owe us 18,000 dollars! De Ming is our client. Mind your language. But he's right. You still owe me 18,000 dollars. Mr. Lung, I'll pay you back everything. These cards will determine if I can turn things around. -I'm going to hit him. -Hit him! -I'm going to hit him! -For real! -I'm really doing it! -Hit him! Thank you. Fatty, I'm raising you 28,000 dollars. Okay, I'll call your bet! I'm sorry. I don't know how to hit people. LITTLE DOU DOU IS LOOKING FOR HIS MOM Are you hungry? I'll give you some bread. It's late. I have to go home. I can't keep you because my dad hates dogs. I told you to lock the door, why… Hey! What are you doing? Get away from the dog. I said don't touch him, didn't you hear? Today is my birthday. I want to keep him. I bought this fresh peanut butter this morning. Come, eat. What happened to your eye? Why is it bruised? Could you, please? I send you to school to study, not play. Eat up. Why aren't you eating? I'm allergic to peanut butter. When did you become allergic to peanut butter? Are you sure? Mom won't let me eat peanut butter. Yes! Your mom knows everything. But from now on, your mom won't be cooking anything for you. Get used to it. Don’t eat it. Here are five dollars. When you're hungry, get something to eat downstairs. This is 20 dollars is to help your old man buy a lottery ticket, 2359. Got it? 2359. Twenty dollars bet, okay? Mom says I can't help you buy lottery tickets and-- Just do it. Don't say anything. Remember! I’m in a rush. Shall I tell you a story? "There were tadpoles in the pond." Right! Do you have a name? It's okay. I'll give you one. How about Little Tadpole? You don’t like it? How about "Dou Dou"? All right! From now on, you're Dou Dou. I'm your master. Good boy. Master now commands you to get well. His condition is serious. -I'm sorry-- -No! You must save him. All right, I'll do my best. I'll give him some painkillers and antibiotics. Do you like the sea? -The sea? -Yes. It depends on my mood and the situation. I've got a job. Nine months out at sea, seven-day week, no holidays. Nine months? What's the pay like? It'll be four to five times more than what you're earning now. That's great. But who'll take care of Xing if I take up that job? You'll have to figure it out. Don't you have relatives or friends? What relatives? You're my best friend. Don't even think about it. I've got a phobia of children. You've got a week to consider. If I accept it, can I get an advance on my salary? Are you gambling again? Remember what you said to me four months ago when you begged me for help? Do you have amnesia or are you just embarrassed to say it? You swore! You would change for your wife and son. How can I forget? That was the night she left me. I think she had her reasons. Reasons? What reasons? As a mom, she shouldn't have abandoned her eight-year-old son! Just give the job offer some thought. 1300. 1683. 9936. 4728. Can you turn up the volume on the radio? Are you saving on electricity or something? Next are the winning numbers. Third prize, 2359. 2359. I finally got my lucky break. Five years. I finally bagged the third prize. Xing. I've got good news. I've caught a lucky break! Where did you get the medication from? Are you sick? You did buy me my lottery ticket, didn't you? Don't play with me. 20,000 dollars! Just to save the dog? Dad! I beg you! I won't do it again! Please give Dou Dou back to me! Dou Dou! Dou Dou! Dou Dou! Don't take Dou Dou away, I beg you! Dou Dou! Dad said it's already very fortunate that Dou Dou is alive after being struck by lightning. I don't know how much longer Dou Dou has. Be it a year, a day, or an hour, Dou Dou is still my dog. I will take care of him. 93831122. Okay, thank you. You can get your car next week. Okay. Hello. -What can I do for you? -My car needs repainting. Repainting? But it looks brand new. I don't like the color. What color do you prefer? Black at the front, white at the back. What? Black… Is there a problem? I like black and white. -Pass me the color charts. -Don't trouble yourself. Black at the front, white at the back. Wu Bi Zhu. Wu Bi Zhu? Chen De Ming? I can't believe it! It really is you, Wu Bi Zhu. Call me Ginny. You've grown into a beauty since your days at the orphanage. You were both from the same orphanage? We were best friends! Also the most mischievous and troublesome. Some things never change. You seem to be doing well. I'm just a reporter. When did reporters start earning good money to afford such cars? This is my friend's. Boyfriend? I'm in a hurry. This is my card. Remember to call me. We need to catch up. I have too many things to tell you. I've got to go. Your eyeballs are coming out of their sockets. Come, I've got something to tell you. Ling Ling called me last night. What? Where is she? She's been here all this while. Singapore? Then why has she never called me? What did she say? She… Have you considered the job offer I spoke to you about? About that, I… Wait. Why are you suddenly bringing this up? If you are taking that offer, she would be the best person to care for Xing. What's so good about her? She left and disappeared for four months! -Now she wants my son? -Xing is her son too. -You know he needs his mom. -So? She lost the right to be his mom the day she gave up on him! And you think you'll do a better job of caring for Xing? Do you know his shoe size? What about his shirts? -His favorite food? -Okay. Enough. Stop telling me all this. Where is she? I want to see her. She can't see you at the moment. Is she with another man? Don't make assumptions. Just know that she has been doing well these past four months. She's ready to take up the responsibility of being a mom. Being a mom? What about a wife? De Ming! Tell Ling Ling, over my dead body! She'll never take my son away from me! David? It's me, De Ming. Yes, it has been a while. Well, I need your help. I was wondering if you have some money that you can loan me. No, it's fine. Let's meet up soon for drinks. Xing, pack your things. We're going on holiday. I told you to go pack your clothes. Hey, do you hear me talking to you? Stop drawing! You think only of the one who left you, not the one who cares about you. Is there a problem with your head? Can we take him with us? What do you think? Who will take care of him after we leave? I don't know. Right, we can take him to the SPCA. He's my best friend. So? There are even people who'd abandon their husbands and sons! Be good. We don't have the resources to care for him now. We're in debt. I know those people. They may kid around… Anyhow, what we need now is not a sickly dog. But lots of money. Gou, it's a hassle dressing up for work in this hot weather! What do you know? It's part of the boss' reform plans to secure more business. How are we going to get more money by dressing up like this? Jeez. Have you… Let me ask you. Have you ever seen other loan sharks dress up like this? No. The point is… Do you think the public will call the police once they see us like this? That's why. Without them calling the police, we can get our job done and help the company recover more debts. Understand? Stupid! Jeez. I wouldn't be here doing this job if I was smart. What did you say? What do you mean? Say it again! Gou, I still don't understand how these reforms benefit us. Didn't you hear that the boss plans to set up a welfare fund? Is that where 20 percent of our salary will be going towards? Yes. He'll put in another 20 percent into the account. That means we'll have a lot of money. But he said we can only use it to get married or buy a house. He wants us to settle down. Did you know that Singaporeans are opting to have fewer kids? Look at me. What girl would want to marry and have kids with me? All I really want is to save up some money and take my grandma to Shantou for a holiday. Just take her to Genting Highlands. What's fun about Shantou? You don't understand. My grandma is from Shantou. She wants to pay her respects to our ancestors before she dies. What are you doing here? There's still time before I need to pay up. We're here to collect from some other lowlife. We're here to collect from some other customers. Hey, you have until tomorrow to return the money. I know. Do you have the money? Don't worry. I'll pay back what I owe. Okay. See you tomorrow. Don't make me waste the paint. -Have a pleasant day. -Hurry up! Third prize, 7220. 7220. Second prize, 9822. 9822. Today's first prize is 0609. 0609. 0609. 0609. Dou Dou, come here. Good boy, come here. Come. My God of Wealth. Dou Dou. Come, Dou Dou. Xing, did you not realize? He can predict lottery numbers. You still have the mood to read? Xing. Please get him to help me once more. Dou Dou, come with me right now. I'm warning you, don't make me angry! You want to eat? But… Listen. Let's be clear. After you've eaten, you'll help me pick out lottery numbers. Four numbers. Okay, deal. Here. You've eaten, so let's start! Let's begin! Hey, you can't do this! I fed you! Okay. I've had enough. Xing. We need to talk, man to man. I'm begging you. Please ask Dou Dou to give me the four numbers. Okay? Xing, I'm down on my knees. What else do you want? Why are you behaving like this? Look, we can make lots and lots of money. With the money, we can pay off all our debts. We don't have to hide anymore. -We can even go on holiday. -With Mom? Yes! With Mom. Okay, tell him to pick out today's winning lottery numbers. The Toto number will also do. Okay, fine. Next time then. Just give me the four numbers. Hello, Tan. De Ming here. Get me the lottery number 7277. Twenty dollars bet. Don't make a mistake. Third prize, 9662. 9662. Second prize, 2519. 2519. Today's first prize is… Hey. What happened? Tan has run away! -Where is he? -Run away? Xing, are you done? I don't want to leave. Hurry up and stop talking. My tears are no longer lonely You bastard, where have you been? I was at the TV station for a shoot. There was a delay. You went for a shoot? What am I? An idiot? I was an extra. The director even praised my acting skills. What were you playing? The roasted pig on the altar? I played a loan shark's errand boy. You're an idiot! We need to maintain a low profile, yet you went on to play a loan shark role! What if the police identify you? Right, I'll be more careful next time. I won't play it so convincingly. Next time? Stop acting! Listen up. Next time, inform me before you do anything. Okay. But in Singapore, the price of everything is rising except for our salaries. I just want to have enough savings to migrate with my grandma. Migrate? Please. You didn't even finish secondary school. Gou, don't look down on me. You're a Chinese immigrant yourself. I'm a Fujian University graduate. Then why are you working as an errand boy in Singapore? I majored in agriculture. What? Just get the job done and you'll get your bonus. What do you mean? A new scheme. The more debts we recover, the more bonuses we get. That, or a pay cut. So how are we doing? What do you think? If we can't get this debt back, forget immigrating. You won't even be able to take your grandma to Genting Highlands! What? Got you! Chen De Ming, come out here! -Chen De Ming! -Chen De Ming, come out! I want my bonus! -Wait here. -Where are you going? I'm getting the tools. Xing, we need to go now. Hurry! Let's go! My inhaler. Go get it. Xing, take this. Wait for me at the back. I'll take care of Dou Dou. What are you doing? You told me to use my brain, so I did. I locked him in. He can't get out, but how are we going to get in? You're right. It's okay. I'll just undo the chains. What's wrong? I forgot to bring the key. You… Here's one for the books! Cut them open! How do you cut through chains? If we fail to collect this debt, I'll cut you up instead! -Hurry up! -I'm cutting! Dou Dou, hurry up! Xing! Xing! Xing! Are you okay? You're bleeding. Hello, Lucy. It's me, De Ming. I know it's late. But it's an emergency. My son's hurt. I need… What? Funeral? Your husband? I'm sorry. My condolences. Take care. Thank you. Xing, let's go. Ginny, thank you for your help. I'll return the money I owe as soon as I can. Don't worry about it, it's no big deal. I'm headed home. Do you want me to drop you off? That would be nice. But I can't go home now. What do you mean? Renovation and repainting work. Courtesy of the loan sharks. Do you think I'm joking? No. Looks like you haven't changed at all. How about this? If you don't mind, you can stay at my place for a few days. How can I do that? Wouldn't I be imposing? Your house is huge. Thank you. Did you take all these photos? Yes. They're beautiful. No, it's just for fun. Do you want something to drink? -Anything. -Okay. Are you feeling better now? Xing, take your medication before going to bed. I don't want to stay here. I can't sleep without my pillow. I want to go home. We're only staying here for a few days. What if Mom comes home and we're not there? She's not coming home! If she wanted to, she would have a long time ago! I'm warning you. Enough. You… I said enough! This is my final warning. Come here! Why don't you listen to me? Go to sleep! Dad. It’s nothing. Go to sleep. Is Mom really not coming back? I know you miss her. I hope she comes back too, but it's just not possible. We'll have to carry on without her. You'll get used to it. I don't want to get used to it. I want her to come back. I know, I understand. You don't understand! -I really do. -If you do, then look for her. When my mom left me, I was just six years old. Where is she? I don’t know. Do you miss her? At first, I thought about her every day. As time passed, I didn't anymore. It's getting late. Go to sleep. Okay? -Scrub his neck clean. -Okay. Here. I'm turning on the water. His neck. Here. Okay. -Almost done. -Okay. Hey! What is this? Dou Dou, tomorrow is Wednesday. You know what I want. Let's start! Hey, come here! Xing, tell him I need the numbers. No wonder you got him a collar. What number? You can't keep asking him to do this. He'll get worn out. Don't worry. When I hit the jackpot, I'll buy him a big, comfy bed, and he can sleep all he wants. What? Jackpot? Are you saying this dog can predict the jackpot? I didn't believe it at first, but it's true. How is this possible? I don’t know. Maybe this is God's miracle for me. It's for me. He's my dog. You wanted to throw him away. I thought he was sick! Can you just throw him away because he is sick? He's not a person, he's just a dog. A good dog. If he picks the winning number, will we go home and wait for Mom? Of course! As long as he picks the numbers, you can do whatever you like. How did you train him? I didn't. After he was hit by lightning, he had superpowers. It's incredible! How could this happen? It's a miracle. I've never bought a lottery ticket in my life. Not even once? I don't believe in luck. Since I was young, I only believed in-- Fate, which we control, right? But to me, it isn't just fate. I'm also buying myself hope. You have a point. Everyone needs hope. You're right. Let's go. Thank you. My baby, I bought the toy you wanted. I got them in every design. Now? Not now, I'm working. When I'm done, I'll go to see you. Be good. Where were we? Mr. Lung, we did our best. He's not at home. I looked for him at his workplace and in other factories. Have you eaten? No, I haven't. Sit down and eat if you're hungry. You dare to be hungry when you've yet to recover the money, you bastard. Have you thought of any plans? We have. We're looking for his neighbors and family. We'll capture them, beat them up, and let them know we're-- How many times have I told you? We're businessmen. Not triads, understand? I'll give you three days. Go! Xing, will you be okay here alone? I am already eight years old. Don’t go too far. Mom! It's time! Mom! You've got the wrong person. I'm not your mom. -I'm sorry. I thought you were-- -It's okay. Can you help me look after Xing? How many people, sir? -I'm looking for someone. -Okay. Sorry, I'm late. It's okay, I just arrived. A glass of water, thank you. Water? Yes. It's healthier than beer, right? How are you? Yes! I'm fine. That's good. Dian Dian, I did it. What do you mean? I hit the 4D jackpot. It's the first prize! Didn't I tell you I would hit the jackpot? I did it! How is Xing? He… He is fine and happy. He made a friend recently, but it's a dog. A dog? Don't you hate dogs? But this dog isn't a regular dog. He is about this big. He is really cute. Xing named him Dou Dou. Cute, right? I asked Mrs. Lim to tell you about… Thank you. About Xing. -You know he needs-- -She told me. And I've given her my answer. I'm really sorry for leaving. But I couldn’t have stayed. I'm sorry. You left us. You left your husband and your eight-year-old son without a word. And all you can say is sorry? Don't you think you've gone too far? You promised you'd change. I did. You don't know how hard I tried. I never doubted you. That's why I've been waiting-- So you feel sorry for yourself? Do you know why I got addicted to gambling? I don't want to talk about the past. What I did was only for the family. I wanted to give you and Xing a better life. These are just your excuses. How do you think a welder can afford to bring you on a holiday abroad every year? I never asked you to. You never said it, but that was what you thought. You often told me about how other men treated their families. I didn't mean it that way. To me, that was what you were saying. Forget it. It's useless to say anything now. We can't go back to the way things were. But I have to tell you honestly. Don't even think of taking Xing away. De Ming. I beg you. Don't be like this. Haven't I gone through enough? And what, all was well with me? I was so depressed. I didn't know what to do. I took my anger out on Xing, and I even beat him. I couldn't control myself. Calm down, people are looking. De Ming. I've made a full recovery. I went to see a doctor, and he said I'm cured. I can take care of Xing now. I beg you. Return Xing to me. Xing is also my son. Don't even think about it. Aren't you tired? With this? No, I'm not tired. I've never been happier. Xing, do you know? There will always be a few deciding moments in one's life. And this is one of them. Will Mom come back? Hey, aren't you the dog's owner? -What are you talking about? -So it's true. What are you going on about? Your dog, it can predict lottery numbers. There's no such thing. Don't listen to rumors. It's true, look. MIRACLE DOG HAS A SUPERPOWER TO PREDICT LOTTERY NUMBERS Mr. Lung, we've got news about De Ming. I'm not interested in him now. I want the dog. This is a great story. I want follow-ups. Let the dog pick this week's lottery numbers. And I want the whole thing recorded. Also… You're a reporter, there must be ways. Do you need me to teach you how? -What's the matter? -This man says that he is the dog's actual owner. Yes. I'll call you back. -Hi. I'm Kelvin, the editor-in-chief. -Hello. I'm Patrick. This is my dog. You should've told me before doing the story. Dou Dou didn't die after he was hit by lightning, and he can now predict numbers. This is big news. I think everyone has the right to know about it. That's your opinion. Have you put yourself in my shoes? I only know that Dou Dou is mine. I don't need the whole world to know because I want to protect him. You're not protecting Dou Dou, you're protecting your goldmine. If it was you, wouldn't you do the same? Is this so important to you? Why write this story when there are many others to write about? This is my first exclusive cover story. I don't understand. Ginny, you have it all. Look. You have a beautiful house, a stylish car, a great job, and a boyfriend who loves you very much. Aren't you satisfied? De Ming, you're still as naïve as you were back then. Let me tell you. What I have today, I fought for them. Let's go. -Hi, may I ask-- -Why are you here at my house? Well, this man says he is the dog's owner. You're the owner? Yes, I'm PP's master. How are you, PP? Hello. See, he's barking. PP, come. Which dog doesn't bark? You're right. I have proof. I'll let you have a look. How are these photos proof? You're funny. Okay, we'll let PP choose between you and me. Then we'll know who his master is, okay? Let me make it clear. Whoever loses will never see the dog again. Okay. Xing. Are you sure you want to do this? -Are you sure Dou Dou will choose you? -PP. This isn't a joke, our survival depends on him. I'm sure. -Really? -Really. Okay, I agree. Okay. -Dou Dou, over here! -Come here! -Come here! -PP, come here. -Dou Dou, come here. -PP, come here. -Come here. -This way! -Come here. -Dou Dou, come here. -Come here. -Come here! -Come here, quick! -Come here. -Dou Dou, this way. -Come here! -Dou Dou, come here. -Dou Dou, this way! -Come here. -Dou Dou, come here. -Come here, Dou Dou! -Come! -This way! -Come! -Come here! -Dou Dou! -This way! -Come! -Come here! -PP! -Come! -Come here, Dou Dou! -Come quickly! -Come! -Come! Dou Dou! -Come here, Dou Dou! -Come here! -Come. -Dou Dou! -Come here, Dou Dou! -Come here! -He's cheating! It's over. Dou Dou, come here. Hey! PP! We won! Let me tell you. I won't give up so easily. -You'll be getting my lawyer's letter. -Good boy. Congratulations, De Ming. Do you get what I mean now? Everyone wants to get their hands on Dou Dou now. How many more incidents like this can I deal with? But I must thank you for taking us in these past few days. We have to go. Xing, let's go. Dou Dou. -Dou Dou! -Dou Dou! Excuse me. Excuse me. Please excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. -Can you look at this? -Look at this. -Can you look at this? -Help me with this one. Mr. Lung, I'm sorry. I'm returning the money to you now. I've added an extra 5,000 dollars to make up for it. Am I that unreasonable? I've always been good to you. The last time you needed money, I didn't even hesitate to give you some. As buddies, we should help one another. Yes. Do you know my daughter, Ting Ting? She is nine years old. My only daughter. Just like you. Xing is your only son. Yes. So you should understand my feelings. As dads, we hope our children will grow up healthy. But God is always against me. Here. Look, this is my precious daughter. -Isn't she pretty? -Yes. She is pitiful. She has been in bad health since she was born. She is frail and sickly. I've taken her to many doctors. They were all useless. Despite their knowledge, they failed to cure her. I've even brought her to fortune-tellers. They all said the same thing. There's only one solution. I need to find a special dog. A dog that has survived a lightning strike. Only that dog can cure my daughter. But where do I find this dog? But… Could this be the miracle? Buddy… As a dad, you must know how I feel. I beg you, help my daughter. Tell me your price. -How much money for the dog? -No! He's my dog, my family, my best friend! Family? Beautifully said. Did you teach him that? Am I that difficult to get along with? Just name your price. I won't let you down. Mr. Lung. I'm sorry. My son has made his decision. He is stubborn. Even as his dad, there's nothing I can do. I'm sorry. Please take the money. How unfortunate. I really thought we were buddies. Mr. Lung, are you thinking of kidnapping the dog? Xing, we must leave. But we just came back. -What about Mom? -Your mom? Didn't you see that man's expression? It isn't safe for Dou Dou here. We have to leave. Where are we going? Wuming Island. I know a friend who can take us there in their boat. Wait until we win next week's lottery. Then all our problems will be solved. We can call the police to arrest the bad guys. The police don't have time for us. They're busy with floating corpses every day. Where do they have time to care for your dog? Do you want to protect Dou Dou? -Yes. -Okay, we leave tonight. Go to sleep Be good and go to sleep, my baby Go to sleep -Dad's here keeping you company -Gou. Go to sleep Mr. Lung. Honey, Dad has to go to work. I'll sing for you later. Xing, quickly. -Quickly. -Okay. Xing, quickly! Mr. Lung. Quickly! Xing! Xing! Dou Dou! Dou Dou. Don't hit me! You disappoint me. I thought, as a dad, you'd understand my feelings. You forced me to do this. Where's the dog? Tell me! Don't hit my dad! Xing! Good boy. You came to save your dad. Tell me, where's the dog? Then I'll leave you and your dad alone. I don't have time to joke around. -Don't make me angry. -Xing. Tell him. Where is Dou Dou? I don't want to! Mr. Lung! Mr. Lung, let my son go. I'll find the dog and give him to you! I'll ask you again. Where is the dog? Mr. Lung! Xing! Mr. Lung, let my son go! He has asthma. He needs his inhaler! Medicine… Xing. Xing! Xing! Mom! De Ming. Xing says he wants to see you. Xing. Feeling better? Where's Dou Dou? Don't worry, he's at home. Actually, Mr. Lung really isn't a bad man. He let you go when you fainted. Mom said I'm going to live with her. Yes. You should be happy staying with your mom. Besides, I'll be busy working abroad. I need to earn lots of money to buy you things and take you on holiday, right? Are you leaving me because I'm naughty? What are you thinking? You'll always be a good son. My good son. Come, let me hug you. Bastard! I don't have time to play with you. Pick out the lottery numbers. Dou Dou! Dou Dou is in trouble! I sense that he is in trouble! Didn't I tell you Dou Dou is at home? -Go to sleep. -No! You're lying! I know Dou Dou is in danger. -Xing-- -Tell me. What happened to Dou Dou? He is with Mr. Lung. Don't worry, he's safe. They'll take care of him. Because Dou Dou is their God of Wealth. They won't let Dou Dou go. We must save him! Okay, we'll go save him when you're feeling better. I promise you, they won't hurt Dou Dou. -Dou Dou will be fine. -No! There's no time! If we don't save him now, it'll be too late. Xing, I know you're worried about Dou Dou. -But-- -Dad, please. They'll kill him. They won't. You see, they need Dou Dou to help them pick lottery numbers. Why would they hurt him? He can't! What are you saying? He doesn't know how to! You mean… All this while, you told Dou Dou which numbers to pick? We must save Dou Dou! Next are the top three winning numbers. Third prize, 2012. 2012. Second prize, 2805. 2805. First prize, 9819. 9819. You lied. Mr. Lung. My baby. It's you. Sit. Eat up. No, thank you. Mr. Lung, let me get straight to the point. Are you going to tell me that the dog doesn't know anything? He picked the numbers my son told him to. Then, I should kidnap your son. Mr. Lung, kidnapping is a serious offense. I'm just kidding. You think I want to risk my life? So… Let my dog go. This is tonight's winning lottery number. Will it get picked? It will. Okay, deal. But you can't leave yet. You'll have to wait until the results are out. Eat up. Can I first see my dog? Didn't you say the dog doesn't know anything? Why risk your life to save him? Because he's family. Thank you. Liar! The number you gave me was fake. Let me go! Dou Dou! Hello? Mr. Lung, I'm sorry. Something happened and we couldn't reach you. We've tried our best. My baby… He's going to die. But he seems to be waiting for someone. Dou Dou. Hang in there. Your best friend is on his way. -Where's Dou Dou? -In the operating room. Dou Dou… Dou Dou, are you not feeling well? It’s okay. I'll give you some medication. You'll get better. We still haven't had our day out with Dad and Mom. Are you hungry? Dou Dou, stop sleeping. Dad, why has Dou Dou stopped moving? Can you help me wake him up? Xing. Dou Dou is gone. Where is he going? He has gone to a better place. No! I don't want him to go. I don't want Dou Dou to go. I want him to stay with me. Dou Dou. Dou Dou. Dou Dou. Dou Dou, I'm your master. I command you to wake up. Dou Dou! Dou Dou. Dou Dou. Dou Dou. Mom, I want Dou Dou to wake up. I want him to wake up. Dad… A YEAR LATER A YEAR LATER Do you like him? Today is your birthday. Shall we take him home? Dou Dou has left us. Dad said that's how things are. You earn some, you lose some. I still don't know why the number I gave Mr. Lung didn't get picked. I also don't know why I would lose my prediction skills. But I know that Dou Dou is my friend forever. My family, my dog.
