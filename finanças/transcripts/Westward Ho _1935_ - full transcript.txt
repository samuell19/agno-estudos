Calm down, my friend. What happened? But what happened? Help me. They stole my horse. and left me to die. Where did they rob you? There are 5 miles behind. I got here but could not, do more without a horse. John, tell the boys to bring the waggon of provisions. We'll take care of him. Do you think we'll pass by Paiute Meadows tomorrow, will we, Allen? Around noon, I believe, if that interests you. Oh no. Just a curiosity. I thought it mattered to you. This Allen, is there long time with you? Do not. Because? Oh, nothing. I think I've seen it, somewhere before. Not only did this travel with us. It's all right. I know. I'm not so sure, MS. Gordon. Of course, I'm not accusing Allen. But this is an old trick, for the robberies on the way. Put a man to that I lead the team to the trap. But John is not, this kind of people. You can not say, Mary. We do not know much about him. Your father is right. You do not know him. Ah we met him alike, as we know you. Yes? But I did not come to look I work, or came? Maybe it's right. I will always be attentive. Very well. You're the girl I love. It's been a long time. The girl that I help. In my dreams. When in the high castles. That I build in heaven. You were my queen. Of the queens. You have the eyes.

I'll do anything I want. What's new, Jim? Guys let's change, our plans. I met a stranger in the team and I did not like his looks. But I will have this flock in Paiute Meadows at sunrise. Be ready, to fall on them. Well, I have to go back, so they do not suspect. Well, if you'll excuse me, Mary, I think I'll go to sleep. I'm tired. Thank you very much. I really enjoyed your music. Well, good night, Blasted. Good night, you bastard. Dad, I think it's wrong, about John. Do not worry, Mary. We'll get to know him better tomorrow. Where is John Allen? He went to sleep, he was tired. I think it's a... liar. Not at the camp? I did not find him, nor his horse either. It is as I imagined. He went to your pack. I do not believe. Let's move on tonight. We'll get him tomorrow. We can be at Paiute. Meadows at sunrise. Is a good idea. Tell the boys, to move the herd. We'll leave here tonight. That's right. I think it is, making a mistake, Dad. Gives the same, I do not have much choice. Oh, go, oh, oh... Well, boys, Let's get them! He'll get the guy, that hurt you, Lafe. Good work, son. Take charge of them, boys. It's ok? Yes, thanks to you. Did they grab everyone? It is missing one. I separated this guy for you and made him sweat much. He knows the cavalcade, from the Buckhorn Trail. So you rode on the Buckhorn Trail, huh? And? You know who assaulted, the Wyatt family? What price has that? Enough, if you know. How much is this? Your life. I will not say anything. It was Whit Ballard. Whit Ballard? Where is he? I do not know. Do not lie. Where is he? You will find him in outskirts of Grass Valley. All right, Carter. Let this man go. Our agreement is to leave the country and stay away from Grass Valley. Now, go on. Carter... takes the herd to Grass Valley and wait for us, south of the city. That's right, Captain. Why did not you tell us, Who was he when he joined us? I saw no reason, to say. I thought there might be problems and decided to lend a hand. Oh, I know. So you expected trouble. Well, when pursuing outlaws, problems can always be expected. Are you in the service of the Government? Not me... I organized these men, for a personal reason. Oh, I'm sorry, John. I did not want to look curious. Oh okay. There's nothing, who can not know. In fact, I would like it You knew all about me. For 12 years I lived with one idea in mind: Catch the men, who stole it, They killed my parents... and my little brother. If they are alive, I have to find them. Come on, boys! Dad, you're hurt! It's just a little shoulder scratch. But if it had not been for Jim, they would have gotten me for sure. Oh, I did the best I could. These Rangers Knights really took care of everything. I'm sorry, Jim. I think I was wrong about you. It's ok. We all messed up. I was wrong too about you. It's fortunate that John's men, arrived in time to save us. Do you know who assaulted us? All are well watched. I told Carter to take the cattle, the Grass Valley for you, and I believe we will do You'd better take the doctor. Well, friends, with your Excuse me, I'm going. It's only 20 miles up, Grass Valley, and I would like to arrive, as soon as possible there. It's okay, son. I want to thank you, for the help he gave us. You can take the horse, that I was using. When you arrive, the Grass Valley, leave him in the rental stable and we'll pick it up there. Well, friends, I'll see you later. I told you to be careful, with these Ranger Knights. But you did not listen to me. He was very sure of himself. No, it was not me. They outnumbered us 5 to 1. You could not have done better. They took all the boys, except you and Red. How did he escape? Simple left, he said. Well, one thing I say. You can not do anything, with these Rangers Knights walking around here. They sure did, our work. "DOCTOR" Philip L. Martin Oh, forget it. You can not trade for money, What you did not bring. Now listen to this. There are about $ 60,000 in gold in the Commercial Bank. They brought in last night of the Big Creek mine. I was waiting for you and the boys returned, to start work, but I had to bring Dugan and his to give us a hand. Well, the best thing to do is stay quiet quickly and clearly. While the Ranger Knights be on this path. "DOCTOR" Philip L. Martin While the doctor attends his father, I'm going to take a walk down the street. There are some things I want to see. We wait for you here. "HOTEL AND BAR" You, you know, if Ballard is this way? No he is not. He makes a visit Sometimes. Thank you. Ed. In between. What is it, Hank? There's a guy down there. asking for you. Yes? Who is it? His name is Wyatt. Wyatt? You remember, Ballard. What you mean? Oh, nothing more. Only when I was, with the flock of Cummings, was Wyatt and his Ranger Knights, the ones that made us in pieces. They were looking for him then. Looks like it came after you. Now it's here. Jim, Hank said the guy from the Ranger Knights is down there. Where is it? At the bar. All right, let's go. He looks like me! Yes, he is. Lucky that I did not go down. He thinks I'm your friend. Wait a minute, mate. Did not you forget something? What do you mean? Our agreement was, which was to go from Grass Valley. In addition to being a thief, You're a liar. Listen, Hank. Get down and get this guy anyway. But get it! Do not shoot, Jim. There are many men in town. In addition, one of our men. Wow, it's like a wild cat! Look how it escapes! It's here, Ballard! Knock the door! Through the window! Take before, to warn your men. Let's go! That was it! "DOCTOR" Philip L. Martin One moment, boys. Did you see John? Yes. Ah... It's up there. They struck him in a fight. Injured? I'll take you to him. Ah... What do you want to do? Who is the girl? Just a moment. She's Gordon's daughter. I have an idea. What has to do, The girl with this? We will never stop Allen, if you bring your men here. But with her here, we can. I will show you. Come on, boys! This ticket will keep away, the knights of Allen and will bring you directly, to our hands. Send some of the boys, to Blind Canyon. When they do, tell them to return. We will meet, at the Wild Horse Curral. Have the rest of the boys ready, to clean the seat so, that I would go back. Get ready the rest of the pack, of Dugan and the fast cart. Come on. Fast. Get the wagon. Well, boys. Mount. You're very clever, Ballard. Let him play without seeing that it is, in your hands. I understand. Brother, against brother. Forget the theme of the brother. You do not know any of this, right? Get out and bring the boys. We leave immediately. What happens to Jim? Well, Jim will serve your purpose. When he finds out that he is his brother, it will be a shame The Rangers, they'll take care of it anyway. In addition, it will be one less, in the division of gold. Now, go on. Your men are ready, to cover the city. I came to tell you, Allen. Ballard's band took Mary. He sent this note. "Allen... I have Gordon's girl, I have a proposal to make you " "Leave your men and come alone to Blind Canyon if you want to have it back" Ballard Carter... I'll go alone. Keep the men here. If I did not return in half an hour, come after me. Hey, what are you going to do now? Ah! It was Ballard's pack, robbed the bank and took all the gold. We should hang them all. Sent someone, to the mine to ask for help? I'll go there now I'll go with you. Let's Stay Together and let's all go! Where is Ballard? I do not know. Are gone. How could you have cheated? and betrayed his own brother? What you mean? I know, John Allen is your brother. John Allen, are you my brother? Yes. His real name is John Wyatt and yours is Jim Wyatt. I heard Ballard saying, to the Red while it was stuck. John has been looking for you since, who destroyed his family. You have to go help him. "WELLS FARGO EXPRESS COMPANY" Careful, John! They caught John in the Blind Canyon. Let's go. Thank you, Jim. Where is Mary? You're safe. He went to warn his men. What you mean? I put you, in a trap John. I got you and I will take you away, because... you are my brother. Your brother? Yes. Mary told me all this. He listened to the conversation, between Ballard and the Red. Ballard wanted you dead, so I would never know. Jim. Let's go back de Ballard, Jim. Your horses are behind us. I will hold them while you escape. This is your chance. And what will it be, yours? Oh, I do not care. Let's go together, boy. The one in the wagon, it's Ballard. Hyah, hyah, hyah! Jim! Did you get the Ballard, John? Everything is in its place. Ah... I think i will not go Get it, John. He will not be against me, eh? No, Jim. It is funny. I always wanted to be, an evil man, since we were children. Remember? I... I think I have, what I deserve. Oh, my brother ... About the prairies. Home? A wagon. Turning to the West? I'm leaving tomorrow. After dissolving the group. Where you go? I go back to my ranch, in California. I'll be very lonely out of here. Do you think you could ever take care of, um... Tufted like you? You guessed it, you bastard. A wagon. Running. To the West.
