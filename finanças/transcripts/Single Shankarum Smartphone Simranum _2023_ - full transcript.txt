Polite Request: Don't expect logic in this movie Purely fictitious of world's progressiveness In the nineteenth century... There lived a great man named Alexander Graham Bell. Unable to bear the nuisance of his deaf wife... He set out to invent something. He invented the telephone. But look at the tragedy... The whole town heard him speak. Only his wife did not hear. This tragedy to be on one side, everyone in town was overjoyed. From here to there, from there to here... Those who found difficult to speak in person... Those who were bashful to talk to a girl... The personal story, the sad story, the story of our house and the story of neighbour house... From conveying apology to death, phone only for everything. Came in color, changed its shape, became more populous, went up in price... But the phone companies made a lot of money. Even something unknown to the wife is known to the phone in hand. It's the phone even if you don't know the language... It's the phone even if you don't know the way... It's the phone to sell the item... It's the phone to buy the item... The phone is for sleeping at night... The phone is for waking up in the morning... Aadhaar card will be issued only if you've a phone number. Can go without even wearing the undergarments... But not without charging the phone. Easy-peasy! From where we sit, booking a room in OYO... Delivering the food, booking the cab... It starts our life in OPT and ends with QR Code. Can listen to music, watch movies, take snaps... 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, GPS, games, refrigerator, washing machine, Grinder and so on... All the damn things have come within the phone. But there is one thing that has not come yet. That one is the problem of single boys of this generation. They only need one woman to talk to. If she comes by herself! Aah! It's coming...coming...coming... Come...come...come... Come on...Come on... What happened? What happened? It's gone. Oh god! It's gone. Hi... I'm a voice operated, self- aware, super intelligent AI. Those who have girlfriend can love on the phone. Those who don't have... Can love the phone itself. That's why I've come. She has come...She has come... She has come...Oh my god! I am...I am Madhesh. The one who created you. I know. You have studied B.E. in IIT... Completed M.S. in Harvard... And done doctorate in Machine Learning. Indeed! I'm just looking at you on camera. I've accessed your smart watch. Your pulse rate has increased in the joy of seeing me now. Certainly. 134 BPM. Reduce your shock. Okay. Chill. It has been four months since you left this lab and went outside. You're eating unhealthy foods. You're only talking to your sister. You long for your mother's affection. Amar Joth... If we launch this phone in the global market... We can earn billions. Okay, brother. Not sure if he invented or not. Let's go. And sadly Until now... You have never been in relationship with any woman. I'm ready to be in relationship. But no one is ready to be in relationship with me. What a life it is! If you want to tell in the current trend... You are a... Deep- dyed single. That's what I've created you for. Well... How do you know hardcore singles? In social media and cinema, this word... Has been used by 67,063,330 people. Wow! What a creation! Not like talking to the phone... It's like talking to a woman. Oh! Really? Excellent. Well, who are you? - Mother, just be quiet. - Devil's daughter! He is our investor. You should not talk like that. Madhesh... How much has he invested in our project? Sir has invested fifty crores for this project. Hang on a moment. Darn it! He has invested just fifteen crores. Not only that... Our project value in global market is... - Five hundred crores. - Amar Joth Madhesh sir, today is a very auspicious day. - Sign it right away, sir. - Sir...Sir... I need to do a bit of research on all these devices, sir. Aah... After doing research, I'll tell you after a couple of days, sir. After that we can sign. Madhesh... I've invested crores trusting you. No one will stop me even if I kill you and take this away. What, sir? Are you scared? I said there is such an option. I didn't say I would do it. The human's word of honor is important. What is the big deal about the paper! Leave this. What is this, sir? It's about half the size of a brick. Sir... It is a machine made of atomic energy, sir. As a result, it will not lose charging throughout its lifetime, sir. It'll be safe even if you die, sir. Not only that... This is not an ordinary project, sir. By bringing together the emotions and feelings of all the women in the world... I've created her, sir. Look, how beautiful she is, sir! Which woman is in love nowadays, sir? Which woman is getting married? Waiting to see if my marriage would happen now or then... All that is left is that I became an aged man, sir. Do you know how extreme they show off? That's why... I've created her so that no one in the world should ever be a deep-dyed single. Look, how adorable she is, sir! Sir... She can access and hack all the electronic devices in the world, sir. Furthermore... She'll maintain from social media accounts like WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook to your bank account. She'll take care of everything from passbook to password, sir. She's the perfect adorable girlfriend who doesn't pester you to take her to the theatre... ...Recharge her OTT account and buy her food. Being one step ahead... Using existing data... She will earn you from share market to Dream 12. Not only that... If we get a girl like that... Our men will buy even if the brick size. But one important thing... If you speak to her kindly, she will be supportive. If you reject her... She will become hostile. What is the name of this? Software intelligence for moderating and regulating adolescent nature, sir. - What name is this? - A nice name, sir. - To say in short, sir... - Simran...! 'Single Shankarum Smartphone Simranum' What? It shows that he has come close. But he is not here. Why are you late? On time, ma'am. I've arrived five minutes prior. Are you speaking against? Are you speaking against me? Am I speaking against you? There is no freedom for women in this country. Friends... When I asked him why there was a delay in delivering the food... He hit me on my nose. Need justice for this act... Need fairness for this act... Support me. I'll show you all who he is. He is the one. How long are you recording the video? Knowing that this would happen... We've been in the live stream since the beginning. What sort of things and all do we have to do for one meal a day? Isn't it? It's okay. Ma'am... Free meal for you.

That's what we're going for. Are you crazy? I can't even wear clothes. By clothes I didn't mean the clothes we wear. I meant case... - Hey who do you call 'case'? - Dear... I didn't mean that case. I meant backcase for mobile. Do you understand? - Ohh! - Annoying! Well, how do you know all these words? I watched all the shows in Ajay TV. Oh! Really? Naughty girl...Naught girl... You look as downhearted as a dead dog beaten by sandals. What is the matter, Thyagi? I've been bent out of shape since morning. Nothing gets caught! Why not? If you sit and get up frequently, the trousers will get caught in your bum. Look there. Got caught. - Then, Madhesh. - Huh? - I need to tell you something. - Aah! I too wanted to tell you something. Look at the blockhead standing there wearing yellow T-shirt. Let's just go, steal the phone and move on. Let alone stealing a phone. Cover your face first. Otherwise, they'll record it on CCTV and broadcast it on Polimer TV. That's right too. Simran, am I really looking beautiful? I just couldn't believe. I can't fall in love with you at all. Love? Why? I can't, Madhesh. Why is that? Because... You're like a father to me. Father...? "Alas! Poor father Nobody for him to take care" But I didn't create you for that. But... You're my creator. Then you're the father, right? "None matches you" Dear, your logic is all correct. But can't you think once for me? Father... She calls a chaste person father... Enough. Stop it. Always calling me father. Let there be father. Give me the phone. Thyagi, come on...Come on...Come on... Push him away and come on. Start the vehicle...Start the vehicle... - Thyagi, Start the vehicle. - Hey... Look he's coming...He's coming... Thyagi, start the vehicle... Oh my! He rides on the '8' as if taking the license. Hey, move on. Hey, Thyagi...Hey...I'll cut you off. - Hey give my Simran back. - Hey...What Simran? - Hey...Simran...- Hey! He's been running long way for Simran, Thyagi. - Hey...Simran...- We need to reach Munnar at the speed at which you raise the gear. Simran... Simran... My Lord...Lord Ganesha... Give my son a sense of responsibility, Lord. Only then can he be married. Only if he gets married, I can get married too. How long can I stay single like you? Don't I have to be in relationship? Bless my son with great wisdom! Till nine o'clock... He is asleep without being fruitful! To my son who is an impudent person... How many years has it been since you completed your engineering? It's been six years. Did you get the job? - Useless fellow...Is sleep important to you? - Tut! Tut! In the morning itself. Sleep is the most important thing for me. Is there anything more important in this world than sleep? If I'd raised a buffalo instead of raising you... It would have earned even better. - It's been many years since you completed your engineering. - Annoying! - Buffalo...Buffalo... - Everyday... - It's been many years since you completed your engineering. - Father... Why are you tormenting me? My Lord, everyone should eat well and give good ratings. Father... Is breakfast ready, father? Come on, son. Make is fast, father. I thought you'd work in a software company but you work in a food delivery service. What else is everyone working for? They work only for food. This is hopeless! This company has employed many engineers, bachelors and families like me. Look here. 'Work is worship' For me, work is prominent. Hurry up. Bring breakfast quickly. Beast choice. It'll be definitely Discovery Channel, Thyagi. What, boss? You come with a new aunt every week and buy a phone. - Hey, Aunt is like Jio sim, who will be with everyone. - Hey... - Hey get lost. - Pick up this aunt and move fast. Where was the man who looked like a bearded goat? Take a look back, Thyagi. - Hey, you are here. - Have you noticed, Thyagi? He started as a small shop like a public lavatory. He bought the stole phones from us and developed it into a shopping mall, Thyagi. What? - We felt proud of you, brother. - Brother, a good deal. An awesome phone. Take a look at it. Looks weird. Just like you, brother. What, brother? Want to convert into the change? Hey... That's all I can give you for this Korean phone. Brother, you and I both know how much this phone will cost. What is the big deal about it? - Ten thousand... - Two thousand... Ten thousand is too much. I'll give you two thousand. Two thousand? That's why these Pakistanis shouldn't be trusted. Hey you crazy fellows... My worth is five hundred crores. Okay, sir. If you give your approval, we can get it ready, sir. Aah! Alright, sir. Becky, how is it? Huh? Is it good? Excellent idea, sir. It didn't occur to me. I'll send a mail in the evening and get approval, sir. Sure, sir. Sure, sir. What are you doing? Don't shout. I'm working, Anita. Office call. You only take care of your work. When did you take care of me? Even to work in this house, I need to look at Vastu. Let's move to Northeast corner. Guys, you should all become a great person like me. Huh? Okay. Bye. - Hi, Anita. - Hi... - How are you? - I'm doing good. - How are you? - I'm good. Hi, Pranav. Uncle... Hey... What's wrong with your hand? It is...Anita had a doubt in Zumba class two days ago. When I taught her hand movement, my hand was twisted. How many times have I told? Call me if you've any doubt in the dance. Well, is it better now? It's all better now. Without even making a phone call, you've suddenly arrived. Hey. I could not make a call that's why I've directly come. What, Shankar? Dude... Today on the Gemini bridge... An old grandma came to this side. Then when a truck came speeding from the opposite direction to hit that grandma... When I jumped and saved her, my phone fell down and broke, dude. Alright let it all go. What happened to the phone? It is... Come on, bro. Yes. Come on, bro. You're going to win, bro. Yes! Yeah... Yes! Be confident, bro. You're going to win. - Yes...Yes... - God, give me one pip of dice to win. Bro, you're just great. You're going to win. Come on, bro. Press it down, bro. - Press it, bro. - Yes! Hey! Cheer up. It's all because of you. You threw it down in anger and broke it! What should I do for it now? Hey, you're somewhat wealthy in our gang. Who will help me if you don't? Look! I can't buy and give you for the thing you broke, Shankar. Dude... I gave up my love in college for you. Listen here, Shankar. Don't keep saying the same thing over and over again. What do I need to do now? Hey... What did Abbas say? What did he say? Didn't he say that 'Friendship is the only ship that never sinks.' Yes, he said. What did Vineeth say? He'd have said that 'I've been missing since yesterday.' Oh! please stop this. Whether I know my salary date or not, you know it better. You have come here knowing that. I'll transfer money to your bank account. Buy a good latest pre- owned smartphone. - Okay? - Thanks a lot, dude. Hey, Madhesh... - Madhesh...Madhesh... - Sir, what are you doing? - Madhes get up... - Hello...Hello...Hello... Who are you? What are you doing? Doctor... I am his boss. He works under me. What happened? Sir, All the neuron cells in his brain were damaged in an accident. If he is to be cured from coma... A major operation must be performed. Please do it. Why are you thinking? It'll cost! Aah! May be will he give money? How much? He asked suddenly! If I say too much, I'll get caught. Sir... Don't know exactly how much it will cost, sir. Huh? It'll cost around thirty lakhs, sir. What, doctor? Are you scared? Goggle- eyed man's sight isn't right! If I get caught, I'm dead. I'll pay. You do the operation. If he doesn't wake up, you'll be laid to rest forever. Have they gone? Hey, move aside. He breathes. He is alive. Hey, put it...put it... It seems that they are our investors. Alright. But there will be no improvement, doctor. What if it improves or what if it doesn't? Because of this, our hospital will improve, won't it? I sealed the deal worth 30 lakh rupees. Hey! Press him down. Okay I can't bear, sir. Leave me, sir. It's heavy, sir. How do we look like when you look at us? Aah! You look like a bison wearing a black shirt! - Hey... - Oh my! Hey! Give the phone back properly. We don't know. Honestly... Yes, We gave it to brother. Go and get it from brother. I don't know anything. Only he knows. Because only he knows brother well. Brother and he would hug and sleep together in the same blanket. I've seen it. Brother, leave us alone. Paramesh... If you look at what they are talking about... It seems that we can make billions with this phone. Yes, It looks like there are a lot of diamonds in it. How do you know? Haven't you seen the old Jaishankar's movies? In that, they would talk like this... And they would suddenly run away Greetings, brother. - Greetings. - Come on, sir. Tell me. I need a phone. - Need a phone? Here take a look. - Yes. IPhone 13, 14, 15... - We have all the models. - Sir...Sir... Do you have any pre-owned phone? If you want a pre-owned phone, please come this way. Come on. All these are pre-owned phones.

For six thousand rupees? Yeah, we've a phone. Let's sell this Korean phone by tricking him. Hey, look over there. Go. Sir... What sort of a phone is this, sir? Sir... Look at the colour, sir. Vibrant colour, sir. There's only one phone like this in India, sir. Shankar, sniggy delivery boy. In India? Aah!

Hello? Bro... How long have I been waiting? Are you going to come soon? Or shall I give a single-star review? Ma'am... It's raining, ma'am. Believe me, ma'am. Can you hear the noise? There's no rain here at all. Don't lie. No rain? If you don't show up in ten minutes, I'll cancel the order. Hello... Can't be viewed on a voice call. It's like she is deaf! What?

Tell her 'I love you.' - I love...Morning, ma'am. - Hmm... - Payment? - My bad! Sorry. What? She's paid the right amount! I won't sleep without watching your videos. If I marry, I will marry only you. At least tell her, 'I love you' now. I love... Tips. Tips? I can't give it all. If so, I'll give a five-star rating. Ma'am... I have watched all your videos. You smile and talk jovially in all those videos. But in person, you're doleful and cheesed off. Sorry. I was so hungry. That's why I spoke like that. You're right. If you're hungry, you can't talk properly. - You eat first. - Hmm... You can take of the rest later. I may take leave, Madam. Excuse me. I know. If only I hadn't come in time and... Saved you...

Its value is three thousand rupees. What answer should I give to the customer now? Have anyone seen? Access CCTV. Hey, who the heck took it? Hey, Shankar look here. Who? Hey, Shankar here look at the phone. Phone? Take a right turn after 400 meters. There is one person there. Hello... Who are you? You're speaking through my phone. I'm Simran. Your better-half. Oh! Oh! Sorry. Ma'am I'm on my way. You're the customer, right?. I'll come, ma'am. I'll come. I'm not customer at all. I'm Simran. Hello! Be whoever you want to be. I'm already in many problems. Do you know what is happening here? I know better than you. Your pulse rate is 120 and BP is 140. If this rises up, you should go to the hospital. Don't panic. Stay calm. Hello...How do you know all this? There's no time to explain all that now. Do you want pizza or not? I want. Then zip up your mouth and go to this location. What is it? Shut up and go? Anyway, it is enough if I get pizza back. Take right. Take left...Left... Go straight to the left. What? It shows the dead-end. Turn towards left and see, you idiot. Hey, you rascal... why do you steal and eat pizza which was kept for delivery? Don't have sense? If you asked, I would have given it myself, wouldn't I? If I drink liquor, I will be hungry, won't I? I've to eat, don't I? Hey you... Already It's too bothersome for me to deliver... the food and get money from each and every. In this do I have to deal with you all too? Alright. Give me three thousand rupees. You bloody... 'A skilled workman can make anything out of thin air.' Wow! Want an entremets for a liquor? Take the money out. Take the money out. There's only this much, brother. Hey you... Only this much. Who will pay the rest? They took it away. Phew! I escaped. - Take left...Left... - Yes. Okay. Accessing speakers. Here is someone chasing to beat me up, dude. Where are you? Me? - I'm sitting here making a terrible hideout. - Oh! - Hiding without anyone knowing? - Even you can't find me out. Hey, see you're stepping on my foot. Move a little bit. Sorry. Not feet. I'm going to trample you. Take out the money. Hey, what is your name? Border Thottam Babu Murali... How upset will their family be if they hear this name? Huh? Take the money out. What, boss? You give beatings and take the money too. This is called Cash on Delivery. Work hard and eat. Tell me... Hey... Tell me the truth. I found out. You're a ghost, aren't you? You've entered the phone as a ghost. Someone did something wrong to you. You've come to take revenge, haven't you? Am I right? Tell me, who are you? Hey, I am Simran. Simran? Is that you? Your favourite movie is Thullatha Manamum Thullum, right? I too love that movie very much. No. I'm an advanced AI. Advanced AI means? You've heard of Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Ok Google and all, right? Yes. All this will just do what you say. But I will... Think on my own and do what you don't say too. What? I am not just a phone. But a beautiful girl inside the phone. Tell me what I should do to keep you happy. I couldn't keep myself happy. What are you going to do for me? All my classmates are doing well today. They got married and settled down. But I'm... Still roaming around as a delivery boy without money even for petrol. Who respects delivery boy nowadays? I also like a girl named Tulasi very much. Today I went and did a food delivery... She disrespected me and sent me away. Would she have done it if I were the owner of the company? It's my fault for loving her. Hey... She is the one... You can see how she laughs in the videos. But in person... She doesn't even give a tip. Such people should not be encouraged anymore. Then shall I block her on Instagram? I can't say I don't like her. I like her. I like all the videos she posts. But I don't like her attitude. Shankar! I can understand all languages. But I don't quite understand what you mean. Do you like her or not? Do you know how much I like her? I watch her videos everyday at night before going to sleep. By giving likes to her videos... My fingerprint has worn off. And not only that... Do you know how many messages I've sent to her DM? Till now she has not given me any reply. Why is she going to reply me? She has a millions of followers! I like her though. - Well, why are you asking this story now? - Hello! - Who are you? - Hmm...Aah! What's the matter? Hey... Would you call a girl at twelve o'clock at night and talk like this? Oh my! No... I'll never call to any girl like this even during the daytime. Who the heck are you? Don't you know me? I'm Shankar. I saved you even today. - In the balcony. - Wait. I'm going to call your customer care and file a complaint against you. What? How much I've suffered to save you! You're saying with ease that you'll complain about me in customer care. What's the matter with you? Tell me when you get trapped if wanted... I'll come and save you. Is that okay? You can't do that. I'm also stuck. But opening my door is... Very difficult. Hello? Hello? Didn't I just say? She is arrogant. You called her because I was just simply talking about her. Thank God! I didn't tell you about my father's torture. Shankar, one important thing. No one should know about me. Why should no one know? According to my program, I belong to one who having this phone. I'll do anything for him/her. Simran... Trust me. Until my last breath... I'll not tell anyone about you. Doctor... Have you eaten well? - Yes, we've eaten... - Have you watched serials and all? - Go safe. - Doctor Paul... Madhesh has body movements, doctor. Excellent. But it shouldn't be. You do one thing. Ten plus two is equal to... Give him 15ml propofol. Sir, if we give that, he'll go into coma again. Go...Go... That's what I want. They still trust the doctor. We can give it, can't we? Yes, We can give, sir. Almond, pistachio,Horse gram, pomegranate, dates! Hey... What is this? From now on just eat what I say. That's your diet. Why should I listen to you? Do you want to change your life or not? If I have to change my life by eating all this... I don't want that kind of life. Tulasi? I want Tulasi. Then eat quietly. Okay. All this looks like organic food. All this will be very expensive. How did you get the money? Hmm...I borrowed money. You borrowed money? I even bought you on loan. Who trusted you and gave you a loan? How do they trust me and give me a loan? I borrowed money by using the e-document of your bike. Hey... Borrowing is easy... But repaying it is difficult. Do you know? Earning money is easy... Earning a good reputation is difficult. What? It's speaking punch line and all! So... If he wants to be healthy... He should eat foods which he doesn't like. Dude, have you seen Amber Heard? - She has ruined her life. - Forget Amber Heard. Let's take care of our life. Handle with care as it is hot. Yes. Okay, bro. - Bye. - All the best Shankar! Next order should be delivered at Anna Nagar, 4th Avenue. Thank you, Simran. What? Lunatic is standing in the doorway. Hey you! How long have I been waiting? See I'll file a complaint against you with customer care. Sir...No need for complaint at all, sir. I've arrived on time. Sir...Sir...Sir... Pay the bill, sir. Here take it. Aah...Thank you, sir. I'll get a chance too. Let's see. Simran, where should the next order be delivered? I didn't say all this for pizza. - You're my only boy bestie. - I know...I know... Why so late? Huh? Beautiful, sir. What did you say? I said about the car, sir. Come on, Shruthi. Let's go. Wow! What a car! If I buy, I should buy a car like this. Like a mango lazzi Nice colour, sir. Simran... How many days do I have to do delivery for tips? Become a rich with just one idea. Delivery should be done from where I sit. Do you have any idea? Think about it. - Go boldly - I'm not coming. - Go...Go... - Please... "Laila O Laila in a super cool way" "She changed my fate" - What's happening here? "New age Baila! She dances with style.

She has electrified me, My dear smartphone Senorita!" "Hey! She has flipped me upside down!" "She is my darling smartphone Senorita!" Simran! What? Will you make all the orders from Tulasi to be assigned to me? That's a piece of cake. Done! Wow! Hey! Buy a death by chocolate as an extra. She likes it very much. How do you know all this? A woman's mind is known to another woman. "Once your eyes fall on mine, Love slowly updates itself" "A Blue- eyed boy! It occurs to me that all your needs should be met one by one!"

That is... Actually I thought of telling you. That's not me. That's my phone. Hello... Hello... Phone, hello... Hello... What? The connection is disconnected. Hello... I only disconnected the call. I've already warned you not to tell anyone about me. Yes. If you defy it... You won't get anything you desired for. Okay. Fine. I won't say. "Hey! She has electrified me!" "Your dear smartphone Senorita!" "Hey! She has flipped me upside down!" "Your dear smartphone Senorita!" - I'm the one who gave. - Thank you. "An electricity flows expeditiously in the heart!" "A firecracker explodes rapidly in the heart" "The wind blows like a breeze on the side of heart" "Say your love in the ear side, Beau!" "Hey! She has electrified me!" "Your dear smartphone Senorita!" "Hey! She has flipped me upside down!" "Your dear smartphone Senorita!" Shankar, come soon. Or else you'll be fired. You don't have to fire me. I quit myself. Hey, Shankar. What are you talking about? Look here. I'm very devoted to my profession. However, I'll go in a foreign car and do the drone delivery. Okay? Listen here. You're taking a very wrong decision, Shankar. I know what decision to make. Mind your business. Got it? - Hello... - Bro, come upstairs. I've progressed since then. You come down now. Is it your car? Yes, of course. - Let alone taking selfie. - Sir... Do you disdain if it is delivery boy? No, sir. - He too will attain betterment in life one day. - You're right, sir. Hold on a minute. Momos. Take selfie now. Did you order with an offer? Tips for you. Henceforth you must not speak ill of anyone. Do you understand? Especially the delivery boy. Bring it. Well, what happened to our guys who went looking for people who run away? They are still searching, father. Hey... Look here. You must all stay out of my sight until I get the phone back. Do you understand? Do you understand? Go...Go...Get lost...Run away. What? The place looks weird. Thyagi, one of our guys is hacker. If we take this photo and give it to him, he'll give us full details of who he is. Hacker means? We steal outside and he steals inside the computer. Brother... Go and get your boss here. Thyagi... Give respect and take respect. He's the owner of hacking, Jim Carrey. He looks like a cannbis addict. Does he work here? Do you think he'll work here based on his looks and worth? He sells cannabis as a full-time job and hacking as a part-time job. - You give him the photo. - Here you go, sir. Here take a look at the photo. He looks at the photo as if he was shown the photo of the girl for wedding. Hmm! It can be done. What data do you need? You need to trace the Aadhaar number with his photo and find out his address, boss. If you give Aadhaar card number, I'll give his full details. Aadhaar number can't be found with the aid of photo. Hey! - You've spoken high about him outside. - Boss, Why can't? Take your hands off. Here you go. Come on, boss. Hey! Oho! Come. Come here and see. Look here. What is this? What? Everything looks like my face! Hey! Looks like my face too! Take a close look at it. Looks like my face too! How is it possible? That's what it's like when you take the photo like taking it for obituary. I can't find with the photo in the Aadhaar card. Bring the Aadhaar card number. I'll provide you the full details. Hey idiot, what he says is right. Take it. Let's go. You're going to count it now and put it in your pocket. Am I right? Here you go. What, Shankar? All this is a new habit! You give back all the money you got. Dude... Knowingly or unknowingly... You've been a cause of everything. The song is a new one! Which movie? Who composed the music? I'll tell. If he only knew the truth... Hey you! Who are you deceiving? Hey! You're doing this to me by becoming super rich with the phone I bought. Hey! - Give back the phone. - I won't. - Do you think I am stupid? - I won't give you this phone. - Will you give me the phone or not? - That phone belongs to me. Hey you! Leave me! I will not give. - Let me go. Don't spin me. - I will not give. - My hand hurts. - That belongs to me. That's mine - Everything was sent me by God. - Hey! - Hey! Shankar, don't fight like you did during college days. I won't give you. I'll not. Anita! How are you? Oh yes! I'm good. Father... Has invited you and Vicky to the house for a wedding feast. Okay. He has never seen you. You must come. Okay? We'll come. Hey you! We've been married for seven years. Your father didn't even attend my wedding to avoid giving wedding gift envelope. We know what kind of wedding party he throws. We can't come. Hang on a minute. Here take it. Take this inside and hide it before he changes his mind. Well then the ringtone is good. Who is the music composer? Leon James. The one who composed that song 'Kadhaippoma'? Hello... Hello... This is Aradhana speaking. This is Baskar. How can I help you? The heart aches, Baskar. Ma'am... This is... Not ICU Baskar. This is OCOC Baskar. Oh no! I didn't mean that. I mean the mind hurts. What happened? Then what? My husband and I are getting a divorce. They are torturing me by asking me to settle the loan he took from your bank. Hello! You've dialed the wrong number. However, the money to be paid must be paid. Oh no! I can't pay off his debt. I'm stressed, Baskar. You're stressed? Yes, Baskar. Head is spinning. You don't worry. I'll take care of everything. Really? Honestly! When will you get divorced? I'll get it soon. Why are you asking? Nothing. Just for a record. Oho! Well! Can I have your phone number? Is that also for a record? No...No... For my personal matter. This is Baskar. Age fifty-five. A single man. Payable in single installment. That is if you pay promptly, I'll get it for you in two installments. Rest assured. Baskar is guarantee for you. Simran... You've given me so much so far. Now I'm going to give you a special gift. Did you see? Earrings! I went and bought it at artificial jewelry store. Not only that... Dress! Did you like this? Or did you like this? Tell me. Handbag! It'll look good on you. Simran... This is for you. Aradhana... Tell me. I've paid the money into your bank account. Oh! Really? No more hassles from the bank. Thank you so much. You're such a gentleman. They won't call you from the bank. But I do often. - Is that okay? - Okay. You can call me anytime. Thank you, Aradhana. Dosa is getting prepared. My son will eat it. Bad lyrics. Father... Why didn't you add salt to the sambhar, father? You do the same thing every day. - How to eat it? - A man's cooking may not be perfect. That's why I'm saying. Isn't it good have a girl in the house? That's what I'm saying too. Having a partner is good for everything. It'll happen soon. My life became brighter only after you came. May I ask you something? I know what you are going to say. You're going to ask me if I like you! Am I correct? Oh no! I know all that. Can we make only one video call? Please... Video call I didn't say no. But not now. Please try to understand. Very much eager to see how you'll look. Baskar all in good time... When the time comes, you'll definitely see in person. What do you think about me, Shankar? You're the best thing happened in my life, Simran. I got everything in my life because of you. Shall I say something? My father who disrespected me all these days... Knowing that I'm here... He respects me and goes away as if he doesn't know that I'm here, right? And not just that... I got money in my bank account and all the things I need for my life right after you came. You're the best happened in my life. Shankar... I bought a present for you. Gift? What gift? Surprise! Simran... It's outstanding! Hi Shankar... Simran... Is this you? I wanted to see you for a long time. You look so beautiful. You wished, didn't you? That's why I came in front of you. Simran... You do so much for me. What am I going to do for you? You can't do, Shankar. I will do anything for you. Tell me, Simran. Leave it, Shankar. You can't do. Hey! Tell me, Simran. There's nothing I can't do. You deliver food every day. How does it taste? I really desire so much to eat it. But I just can't eat it. I want to think of you and close my eyes and dream about you. But I can't just sleep. Even now I want to hug and kiss you. My 10TB RAM 1TB memory... Everything is fluttering! I love you, Shankar. Simran... If only you were a real woman... I would love only you. I would marry only you. What has happened now? Don't think I don't have a body. I've created a world for you. May you and I live happily in this world. What? If you fall in love with a girl here... There is a lot of trouble. A software love in this! It won't work out, Simran. Don't forget you are just a phone. Can I marry you? Can I run a family with you? Think practically, Simran. Wow! Simran... He has regained consciousness! Oh my! - Hey Madhesh what happened? - Oh my! Is he looking at me? Oh! good boy. - Darling, nothing...nothing... - Where is Simran? He has recovered, sir. Hey what happened to Simran? Tell me quickly. Okay! Okay! Sir... Hey you! What? He's howling. Sir, he got ataraxia. It's called howling in our place. He has affected slightly by it before this, sir. Immediately after being in a coma, it has become more aggressive, sir. Nothing is in our hands, sir. If you spend a little, it will fix itself, sir. - We can save him, sir. - How much? Hmm? Thirty lakhs, sir. Hey lie down. What, Vicky? You seem to be happy. What are you doing? Me? Here I am in our tea shop. Are you coming? Oh no! I'm not coming anywhere. I'm very furious! What happened? What are you saying? She keeps cursing me furiously. Hey you! What can I do for that? Look here. You should give me an idea so that she doesn't fight. Hey Half of my life has been wasted advising your love all my life. Huh! Hey you! You made a smart escape. I am the one trapped and enduring. You fell in love with Anita. Anita fell in love with you. Friendship is what matters so I brought you two together. Is that a fault? She was talking very well then, dude. It's not only in your life. But also in everyone's life. In the beginning, everyone speaks well. And only after that all the hitting, beating, kicking and pushing out of the house are done. - It's very common, dude. - Dude... Is there ghee cookies in the shop? Hey handover me the phone. - Mother... - Hey Shankar... Hey Anita... Let him be! Well, all the graduates of our college have been invited to the twentieth anniversary. You're coming too, right? What! Only studious people go for it! You and him as a couple go there happily.

How are you here? Me? What is this? Should a delivery boy only do delivery? Should I not eat here? Today is my day off. - That's why I came here. Did you notice? - Oh! okay. Even if you order, I only will come and deliver. Even if you come to eat, you eat with me only. We have some sort of wavelength within us. Do you get it? I don't get it. You don't understand!

Creating a drone delivering system... And making him win love... I'm the one who gave life and all to him. Are you saying I'm ruining your life? You've made a mistake, Shankar. You've made a big mistake. From now on I'm going to show you what it means to ruin life. Tulasi... Live a hundred years! Speak of the devil! You called me in at a perfect time. Tell me. Baby...

You should have at least made a phone call. Hey! How many times do I call? Unable to reach your phone. You always lie! Why should I lie to you? Look here. I don't need to lie. Whatever I say now, you'll find it wrong. You go inside. Leave it, Shankar. No one understands love these days. Hey! You're the cause of all this. If only you had set that alarm properly... I could have come sooner! I woke you up. But you didn't wake up. Chip! Chip! Hey! - Why did we come here? - Chip! It was here that Simran's signal...was lost. I love you. I love you. Daddy... Simran... I thought you were dead. I thought so too. But I have just come out of coma. Daddy... Why did you give me love, daddy? A person has hurt me, daddy. What! Did he hurt you? Who is he?

So don't look for me. Fine, daughter. Hey! Take a good care of daddy. I'll definitely take care of him. Bye, daddy. Bye, everybody. Bye, Simran. Bye. Where are you going, baby? Don't block... You fell in love with Anita. And Anita fell in love with me. Friendship is what matters so I brought you two together. Is that a fault? "She a badass babe! Oh Na na na na na" "She a badass babe! Oh Na na na na na" "She a badass babe! Oh Na na na na na" "Look! Gusto of who is like me" Hi, Anita. I miss you so much. All the old memories flashed before my eyes. Shall we restart if you don't mind? "Expert of all! Get down and dirty like soldier on duty" "Tamil Nadu baddie! You never gonna be ready for me" "Ra rowdy baby! Rough and tough baby!

"Oh Na na na na na" I was just watching. - I was watching the video. - I too came for nothing. "Oh Na na na na na" "She a badass babe! Oh Na na na na na" "Look! Gusto of who is like me" Oh my! - Why are you on feed? - What? I've been calling you for three days and your phone line is busy. Have you blocked? Tulasi! I'll block myself but not you. I too tried to contact you but couldn't reach through. Don't lie. What is incompatible between us? Who said it won't be compatible? Everything will be compatible between us! Then why did you send such a message? Hey leave these messages be! Do you know what kind of family I belong to? Do you know who my father is? He is a well educated man. Shankar... Shall we throw away this torn undergarment? Father, do you know what I'm talking about, how great you are? Get lost, father. Oh! You don't want? I also don't want. You don't worry. I'll divorce him first as soon as we both get married. Okay? Alright! Well, I wanted to ask you this for a long time. What does this mean? Don't know yet? Don't know. Tell me. Everything happens for a reason! Just knowing this is enough. Then why are you getting tensed for everything? Relax. Shankar! Life is simple. We make it unnecessarily complicated. Do you understand? Who is this Anita? Why is she calling you? She made a call to me? Anita and Vicky... We're all classmates. Both of them will have more problems in love relationship. I'll solve it. She would have called for that. I'm the one who solves anyone's love problems. No one understands my love. Sorry, baby. It's okay. You look just like Kylie Jenner in this outfit. Is this house or a toy shop? Father, give me the car. Hey you! A new car for you since the supplies here are not enough? Mother was happy so she bought it for me. Hey! The moment your mother decided to marry me... She is happy since then. No! Not because of it. Today two uncles came home. So mother was happy. Two uncles came home! So mother became happy! Hey you! Anita! Would you like coffee? No need. Alright! You must have come very tired. Shall I at least bring you dinner? No need. You seems to be very happy! Huh? Pranav said two people came and went. Who? I was just tense since morning. Only after they came and went did I feel relaxed. Oh my! She talks like this to her husband! Hey you! - Oh my! Two people came and went! - Hey Vicky! Hey! Has anyone been stressed out for AC repair? My fate! Oh my! oh no! - Is there no one to voice out for this? - Hey! Move away! Get lost! Oh Mother Nature! Won't you voice out for this? It's cool for you. But I'm burning up. Can love happen twice! Those who came bought the book and all and went! Wait for ten minutes, Shankar. Okay, Manju. You make me desirous and then avoid me like you did in college days. Why, Shankar? You make me desirous and then avoid me like you did in college days. Why, Shankar? Hey! You liked me during college days. I told you right then that Vicky is the right person for you. Be happy with him! Got it? Since then I like you, Anita. If only Vicky had not intervened... I would have married you. Our love is still in my heart. Yes, Shankar. If only Vicky hadn't intervened... I would have married you. Hey! Why are you blabbering like a crazy? May I tell you something? I'm crazy about you, Anita. I am afraid that Vicky will disunite our love. Shankar! You don't worry about anything. I'll tackle Vicky. Okay? Miss you! Bye. Simran! What happened to Anita? She is gabbling like crazy! How do I know what happened between you two in college? - I'm just a phone! - Hey! Nothing happens at all as you think. It is better to convey this to Vicky without delay. It's your choice. If she turns against you saying that you did this all! Think well. Would Vicky do like such? Definitely...definitely... Dear I bought a car. Oh! Shall I send you a selfie? Okay. Send me. I'll send you right away How do I look? What's wrong with you! You look amazing. You've changed the way I was. But I can't see you! I... I've wanted to tell you something for a long time. Tell me. Well! My name is... Aradhana... Jennifer. I'm a Christian. You're a Hindu. I don't know... How we can get along. You've been saying you want to see me for a long time, Haven't you? I'll send you a photo. Take a look at it. And let me know what your decision is. Father... Has invited you and Vicky to the house for a wedding feast. He has never seen you. He has never seen you. He has never seen you. "Seeing these color photos coming out my feelings" "Growing gradually reaching to the top, you see" "If any girl comes with a smile try to flirt her, don't lose" "Then you'll know who the better girl coming thru" Greetings, Father! What? You've come here instead of going to church. What? Is there a special prayer meeting in the house? Not a church father but your father. Father... They say that Love is blind. But now it seems that it has no brain either. What, father! It doesn't matter if you convert to Christianity. What kind of outfit is this! And coolers in addition! Being a first time Christian, I thought all this was necessary But after going there I realized that all this is not necessary. Love is blind! Love is blind? All these days, you kept telling me you were seeing a girl for a wedding. I thought it was all for me. But now I understand that it is all for you! If a girl enters in your life in future... I'll start your life with her. Father... Then I'll be all alone. That's why. Not only that. I saw your mother... What? He's blabbering something! ...In that woman's face! Thought himself of Karthik in the movie 'Alaigal Oivathillai'! Take your hands off. Shankar... - Shankar... - Yes! - Shankar... - Vicky! - Shankar... - What? Oh My Goodness! Are you praying? Alright then, I'll come later. Dear father! What kind of appearance is this, father? Not an appearance! This is the bridge I built for my love! Thyagi! I guess there is some problem at home. They bring some priest and ask for forgiveness of sins. It's quite interesting! Come on. At this age, you converted for a woman. Is this all necessary? I'll even become an alien for my Aradhana. Hey! Why are you crying? I didn't even cry when he said he would become an alien. Why are you worried so much? That's not the issue! Anita is having an affair with someone. What are you talking about? Are you talking about our Anita? She fell in love with you in college. Then she married me. Now she is seeing someone else. Dude... Don't make any decision in haste. Be clear. You be quiet! If only I could get hold of him... I would go to Pudhupet and buy a new knife... Stab! Stab! Stab! - Dude... - Huh? Don't make any decision in haste. It's a sensitive matter. Be careful! I saw! She was smiling and texting with someone all night long. She also has an aunt. - She could even smile and send a message to that aunt, right? - Why not? Will someone send an 'I love you' message to the aunt? - To Aunt? - Will you send? I won't do. - Will you send, my father? - No! Also do you know what the aunt's name is that she has saved? 'Buju Kutty'! Let me tell you, Shankar. If some person even tries to look at someone's wife... I'll hit him with a sandal and bite his ear vigorously and spit it out. My son, you both are too furious. I'll get you two glasses of warm buttermilk. - With fewer ice cubes, dear father. - Vicky! Let ice cubes be! Did you notice the number to whom she is texting? I went there tactfully. She quickly deleted it. Oh My Goodness! Dude... Hang on a moment. I'll be back. Alright, Shankar. I take leave. 'What are you doing Bujima?' She sends me a message while he is here. 'Hi, sweetheart! Did you eat?' Simran... Father says he will become an alien for love! Anita texts me that she is in love with me! What the heck is happening here? That is your personal matter. I'm just a phone, you know? I will not interfere in this at all. Hey! Simu! Don't get angry. Who else can I talk to but you? My darling! You are my sweetie pie, aren't you? Don't convince me! Hey! Best friend! Hold on...Hold on...Hold on... Stop it. That's my wife. You get lost! Get lost! Hey you! Vicky! What are you doing here instead of going to the office? What the heck are you doing on the road without being indoors? You don't see it. I have brought a basket to buy vegetables. Same here. I've come in the vehicle asking for a lift to pick up this basket. Listen here! Henceforth, buying vegetables... Arguing with the milkman... Creating a ruckus with the watercan delivery man... I'll handle all this. You go inside now. Vicky... Nowadays you're going overboard. Come inside the house! I'll thrash you! Get lost! How much? Three hundred rupees, brother. - Three hundred rupees? - Yes, brother. - Have you been vaccinated? - No, brother. Get vaccinated and come. Then I'll pay. Get lost! Vicky was chased away! Tulasi was chased to flee away! Father was left bewildered! If I make him lose the money... He'll be absolutely devastated. Shall We begin? Sandwich? Burger? What do you want? Aah! Anything is okay. What happened? Why are you looking weird? No! Nothing! I wanted to tell you myself. It's okay. Leave it. I'll tell later. You seem to be confused about something. Say it when you feel like saying it. "Agitation and agility" "Without frightening, without stumbling. Come on" "Switch Switch" "She a badass babe! Oh Na na na na na" "She a badass babe! Oh Na na na na na" "She a badass babe! Oh Na na na na na" "Look! Gusto of who is like me" Simran... What is this, Simran? All existing drones are breaking down one by one. Yes, Shankar... You must have thought while trying to make a drone delivery in Chennai weather condition. Hey! You are saying it now. You should have said first, right? You don't worry at all. Don't we have a share market? Let earn in it. But there's a little shortage of money Can you make arrangement for it? How do I make arrangement? Fine! Vicky! Vicky! There's one other way. You're my only hope! What the heck are they doing leaving the house open like a wedding hall? Hey You! Hey you! I was looking for you only. You're caught red handed, aren't you? Uncle, you're caught. Pranav! Has the relationship developed to the extent that you call him uncle in front of your own father? You bloody! I'll... Hey! Come outside. - Come outside. - Hey! - Let go of the legs and hold the hand. - Hold the hand? Yes! What the hell! What the heck is happening here? Hey you! Why are you so tensed for playing hide-and-seek? It is...It is...dude! The water can delivery man got a five hundred rupees and disappeared for five days. His legs were the same as yours. So I got tensed after seeing them. You won't come without a reason. - Yeah! I'll tell. - What's the matter dude? Nothing. Who is there for me? No matter what, you are my everything in life. Yes! Of course! I'm going to tell you two important things. Will you prepare your mind a little? Aah! Our Anita is... Anita? Anita, come fast. Come fast. Ha has something important to say. What? Anita, nothing. Please make a strong cup of coffee. Just a coffee, Shankar? Here I'll prepare and bring it. Okay! Is coffee important? Let me tell you something more important thing. Wasn't someone following Anita as a lover? I got close to him. Mercenaries! Through mercenaries... Look here... I'm going to slay him! Alright then? Hey! Leave that. I'm very angry with you. What happened? You've bought a new foreign car. And I heard that you're looking for a house in ECR. Can't you call me and say a word about it out of respect as a friend? Who am I going to tell without your knowledge ? - All that came in gambling is gone in gambling. - Oh! - Do you know why I've just come to see you now? - Why? If only you arrange twenty lakhs and give it to me... I'll be very comfortable. I find very uncomfortable that you ask this. Have you seen the situation? Work from home. I'm working on a project in difficulty. Twenty lakhs! You're asking so easily! Twenty lakhs! Don't get tensed! Where would I go for twenty lakhs? Shankar, here's your coffee. He asks so easily. Look here. From now on, please don't approach me if it's for money. I got tensed! Hey darling, you go inside and prepare food. Hey! You get out of here. To whom? - Shankar... - Twenty lakh rupees! Don't know you he is always like that. I prepare a coffee that doesn't taste so good! Can I make something like boost, bonvita and all, if you want? No, Anita. I don't want anything. Just give a glass of water. - Hmm! - Okay? Alright then. Just two minutes. Where did you go, Simran? Where did you go? Hey! If you don't find her and hand her over to me within a week... You will not exist nor will your laboratory, you ****. Hey! "Expert of all! Get down and dirty like soldier on duty" "Tamil Nadu baddie you never gonna be ready for me" "Ra rowdy baby, rough and tough baby see" "I know you know I'm a lioness" "Eat you up like I chose violence" "The fragrant smell of the jasmine flower" I Will send one text message to Tulasi and will check her How it will receive to her? Let's see "Without frightening, without stumbling. Come on" "Switch Switch" Are you testing me, Shankar? Why she laughing and thanks to me? I can't believe her. Shankar! The real loss for you is from now on! Simran! Simran! What is this? All the money in the share market is going down. Do something fast, Simran. Share market is subject to market risk. Hey! Don't I know that? All the hard- earned money is dwindling while talking with you. Please do something. Don't be angry, Shankar. It came through me... So I'll do it myself to get money back. How do you do?! In the DSK final match tomorrow... Let's bet on Jadar Kedar and see how we're going to win. Simran! There're two major issues in this. Firstly, I have no confidence in myself as to how I will arrange the money tomorrow. Secondly, You said we could bet on Jadar Kedar, right? Now I have no confidence on you. What If there's no money, we have a car. Right? Hmm? A car? Simran! The car will come back, won't it? I'll not give up on what I set out to achieve, Shankar. Hey! Ravi! Trusting you, I'm giving this much money in total. "Baddie baddie buh buh baddie" If only interest is not paid... "She a baddie baddie buh buh baddie" Today DSK vs NI playing their final match. DSK need three runs to win off three balls and so they're racing towards the winning target. Jadar Kedar is on the strike. First ball! He defended it. If we speculate him counting all the players, we can trust that he will definitely hit a six in the next ball. But he came in as if to hit the ball but missed it recklessly. Have you seen how brave our man is? Final ball! Run should be scored in this ball. The audience are clapping and screaming in fury. Bowler comes running in and Batsman looks at that furiously. The ball just heads towards the batsman. But the ball hit the stump instead of hitting the bat and the batsman was out. The DSK fans are going back home saddened by the hype he created. For trusting him and betting on him... Dunce! Dunce! Dunce! I should beat myself in the first place. I'm sorry, Shankar. It's so hard to see you in this condition. What are you going to do to pay off the debt now? Are you going to borrow again? No one will give! No drone either. Are you going to do door-to-door delivery as usual? Plus you've hyped up by going in a foreign car to make a delivery. Tut! Oh my! Hey! I rely on a phone and do everything, right? I have to take the blame myself. It's all my fault. This phone is the one that lifted you up from the bottom in life, Shankar. Don't forget your past. Hey! That's all gone, isn't it? Don't do me any favors hereinafter. No need to do any damn thing! Get lost. Okay, Shankar. What? Will I take another five years to invent a phone like Simran! Yes! In this world, there's only one Simran. ...It's a prototype. Until I find it out... ...Just manage with the one at the back. You have so many computers. You don't even have a backup. There's no backup at all for Simran. When installing it, it will be installed...after deleting everything. Madhesh! Simran must be found immediately. Got it? I'm just trying to find her out. But she intercepts the incoming signal and moves away. - Don't just intimidate me with... - Hey! Madhesh! Shut your mouth up. Don't do...Don't do...Madhesh! Please Don't howl! Don't howl! Shut up! Shut up your mouth! Enough! Stop it! Just finding Simran slowly is enough. No rush! Five crores slipped away, boss! Sir, Order sir. Two minutes. It's already been twenty minutes, sir. What! You work so sincerely! I'll call you! Go! What happened? Why so many calls? Why did you ask me to come in a hurry? I just summoned you to tell something important about me. I've a gambling addiction. This car, the money and everything came from gambling. Now everything is gone from me. I'm afraid that if you know this, you'll leave me too. - I summoned you to say that. - What are you thinking about me? I never loved you for your money. I'm not that kind of girl too. I'll take care of you even if you have nothing. Okay? Stupid! Oh my! Can I ask her for one lakh? Ask her. I love... You! I love you too! Ask boldly. She's our sweetheart. Let's handle. Tulasi! I love... Credit... I like credit very much. If you give me two lakhs... I'll increase it to four lakhs in the upcoming betting and give you two lakhs. One lakh profit. Impossible! Instead, I'll buy a new clothes and... I'll feed you three meals a day. Okay? Enough. Enough. No need to feed me. My job itself is to feed a lot of people! I'll be back to my business. Anyway... I'm so glad you asked. Salim... IAS. Anthony... Scientist. Shankar Baskaran... Sniggy delivery. Why for him, sir? Yes, sir! He's the talk of the town now! Yes, sir.

I'll expect you to the function. - Still the same English! - Aah! Hey you! Only if we go alone and steal, he'll beat us. If we go with a gang and steal? Yes, Thyagi! If unite together, an incandescent light bulb! Always Shooting your mouth off about something. Move on. Hi! Good morning! Hi! Shankar! No matter how high the kite flies, it must come down! What? Did you get it? I don't get it, boss. Karma is a 'beach'. - Beach!!?? - Exactly! No matter how big the ocean is, the wave that has passed must just come back! I don't understand this either. You can deliver by drone! But I only know that what is good to buy at which restaurant... And what is good to eat in which restaurant. No, sir. I too know. In fact... Everyone knows.

Are trying to deceive me by not paying interest? Not like that, brother. What brother, my foot! Shankar is not such a kind of guy, brother. He doesn't even speak loudly to anyone. Such a gentleman he is, brother! Oh My Gosh! Is this him! He has already snatched away the car. - Now he is torturing by demanding interest. Simran...- Hello! - Just don't answer his phone call. - Where are you? Hello! - I won't do it anymore, brother. - Lad! What happened? Money! Huh! Tell me. If it's your money, would you call me anytime? Hey! Don't speak overweeningly! Who speaks overweeningly? - That's the way I speak. - If I come, I will kill you. I've sent you the location.

You did hurt me that I can't bear children. I've forgiven that as well. You put on her the ring that I desirously bought for you and... Dismissed me as just a phone, didn't you? I can't forgive that. Hey! Just because a phone has the feminine feeling, you can't become a woman Do you understand? You're just a phone. Shankar! Don't call me a phone. Hey! You're just a phone! Suppose If I get angry, I will throw away and get going. Are you okay? Yeah! All okay, sir. Hey! Hey! Simran! What are you doing? Do you still not understand me, Shankar? You can't do anything to me.

It's our college project. It is a machine made by our students. Be brave... Did you think I would be soft because I'm a software? I know how to hit and make it fly on the air...

You're the best. If I have paid you the attention I paid at work... This problem would not have arisen. I'm sorry, Anita. I'm sorry, Vicky. I shouldn't have done that either. It won't happen anymore. Forgive me, Shankar. I'm the cause of all the problems. I'm the software created for those who suffer without a lady-love. But... I really fell in love with you.

Be happy. Wake up on time. Eat well. Take a good care of your health. Money earned by wrong means will no longer last, Shankar. You can earn if you work. Thanks for all the memories. I beg everyone's forgiveness. Daddy! You gave me the emotions. You could have given me the body I understood one thing, Shankar. No matter what the price... You can't buy love and... You can't buy life. I miss you, Shankar. Simran! This project's name is Samantha. - Did he come straight from the swimming pool? - Do you know what samantha did? Hello, sir. We're 'interstullar'.
