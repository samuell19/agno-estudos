[triumphant music playing] [triumphant music playing] [energetic music playing] Huh? SUE: Xiao Meng, would you like to come and help your mom tie a bow? OK. Mama. SUE: Hmm? The snow is burning. Honey, that's not possible. Xiao Meng, Come here. Come here now. Come on, we need to go find your dad. [radio static] Here they are. [rumbling] Hey, what's that? [chattering] Come on, move! Move out, everybody go! Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, answer me, answer me! What's your location? Sue, answer me, where are you? Tao, by the west slope base station. You've got to leave the camp now! Shit. Sue, answer me. Where are you? Tao, where are you? Where's Xiao Meng? She's with me! Meet me at Parrot Rock. Hurry! [wincing] Hey, wait! Hey, someone! Wait, wait for us! Come on! Get on with me. Wait! Come on! Take her! Get in! Mom! Daddy, Mommy's over there! Xiao Meng, Xiao Meng! Sue. Goodbye. Nature doesn't love. Nor does it hate. It simply builds as it destroys. No one can predict the destructive power of volcanoes. Tianhuo was the fastest known volcanic eruption in history. The Pompeii eruption took place over 12 long hours. Tianhuo's cone exploded in just 20 minutes. It was incredibly violent. It blew open, and then superheated gas and ash flowed out, killing anything in its path. The victims could never know. 100 meters to their left side, or 50 to the right, would have been enough to save their lives. And yet, today it's been turned into a theme park. The people who put this park in that spot are playing a dangerous game. TENG BO (ON RADIO): Passing 60 meters. Seismic activity is stable. XIAO MENG (ON RADIO): Copy. Xiao Meng, how is it down there? Visibility's good. I'm about to place the core sensor. All right. Standing by for data collection. Hey, so you brought your amulet this time, right? Hmm. I'm setting up the last core sensor. Check your temp readings. You're near 1,000 C. Stop showing off. We don't need it that close in. [sensor activates] SUE (VOICEOVER): Xiao Meng, would you like to come and help your mom tie a bow? XIAO MENG (VOICEOVER): Mommy, I'm scared! SUE (VOICEOVER): Don't worry, honey. Daddy'll be here any minute. TENG BO (ON RADIO): Xiao Meng? Xiao Meng? If you can hear me, answer me. SUE (VOICEOVER): Xiao Meng. XIAO MENG: Last sensor in place. [whirring] Huh? [yelping] Xiao Meng! Are you OK? Say something! Pull her up! I'm OK. Don't worry. I'm pretty hard to kill. [groaning] Teng Bo, what's the situation there? Heart rate normal, body temp high, but still healthy. How do you feel? Come on. You did well, Xiao Meng. TENG BO (ON RADIO): More Like well done. She almost cooked herself. Oh, yeah? You worried? I can take it. Now you just sound cocky. Unlike you, I actually have guts. [chuckling] [phone ringing] Hey, we're late for the union. Let's go. Why don't you answer? You know exactly what he'll say. Before we finish, "I'm not going anywhere." If he could see what you've accomplished here, he'd be very proud of you. He won't. I'm gonna go change. CHILDREN: Xiao Meng, Xiao Meng! Xiao Meng! Oh, the queen bee returns. Knock it off. Are we online? Almost. I'll be right back down. Welcome back. Hey. Yup. Gather around. Are we ready? All these long days and nights of hard work and effort, even brushes with... Save us the speech. Hurry up. Sure. [computer activates] Wow. I humbly yet proudly present to you the Zhuque system. It's all there. You finally did it. No, I just found another way to see it. Come on. After working on this so long, it was all worth it. Mom, we really did it. We still need the data in the crater to see the changes in the magma flow. I've arranged for the helicopter. We go up tomorrow. XIAO MENG: It looks like it's waking up. The hotel will need an update about this. They might need to close up shop. Hey, hold on. Let's go slow. There are still a lot of things that we don't know yet. Asking them to close down isn't all that simple. So let's wait until all the sensors are online, and then we can decide, all right? We should let Harris know as soon as possible. Ah, but the data also has to be definitive, correct? REPORTER (ON TV): The Tianhuo Resort Hotel is the brainchild of international real estate developer Jack Harris. This colossal resort is the very first volcano theme park that sits on an active volcano. Harris has enlisted a renowned team of volcanologists as safety consultants head by Professor Jiang. Professor Jiang and his team member Li Xiao Meng, Zheng Nan, and Teng Bo. This resort provides a unique experience for... [gasps] My God. Do we have the CO2 readings yet? The data is cooking. The best meals take time in the oven. Well, hurry up. We don't have that much longer. What's the matter? Something doesn't feel right. All the data is right there. And we've double checked all of our math. There's no way it could be wrong. Then why do I feel like something's off? What's wrong with this? Good morning, sir. Morning, Simon. Perfect day. Lucky watch? Don't need it. I'll all be in the bag by lunchtime. Not now, thank you. Mr. Harris, the plans! Xiao Meng, I need to speak to your boss. He just went inside. We're pitching to investors today. Harris is pushing the engineers to start Phase 2, but the safety advisors haven't approved the final plans for it. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the most extraordinary, exciting, and unforgettable experience available on this planet. For millions of years, mankind lived in fear of nature. We ran from it, we hid from it, we worshipped it. But now we've conquered it for our own entertainment. Now we're in charge. Phase 1 is built. But Phase 2? Well, that's a whole new level of ambition. Tens of thousands of visitors a month, hundreds of millions of dollars a year, all of it powered by free geothermal energy for the eco-warriors amongst us. And you know the best part? We've only just begun. [laughter] Let me tell you a little story. My father gave me this watch. When I was about that big. "What do you hear?" He said, "Listen carefully." So I put it to my ear, and I said "money." Now he's talking. Only a lunatic would build a world class resort on a ticking time bomb of molten earth, right? Wrong. There is no chance of this beast howling again for at least 150 years. And they all know that, too, but they don't want to be reminded of it. Because today's tourists want to live life on the edge. They want to bungee jump over rivers full of crocodiles. They want to eat poisonous blowfish in Tokyo. They want to feel like they're dancing with death, living life to the full, all the while knowing that in fact they're perfectly safe. And that is why Tianhuo is the must-see destination for the selfie generation. Ladies and gentlemen, I want you to meet someone, my partner in business as in life, Qian Wei. You ready? Yes. We close this out, we'll be debt-free. We'll get our life back. When do I get you back? You've always had me. You always will. All right, go catch us a whale. No problem. Ladies and gentlemen, please come with me. Prepare to be amazed. Mr. Harris? Yes. The pipe drilling company is not happy. We're making them drill deeper than the permit allows. I don't pay them to be happy. And there was a problem with the bank transfer. They haven't received the payment. Look, I'll fix the problem with the bank, whatever it is. But they need to understand, they drill where I tell them to drill. Yes, sir. XIAO MENG: That's not a good idea. The famous Miss Li. The mountain's waking up. I've warned you so many times. You never reply to my emails. I'm a busy man. I don't have time to reply to hysterical emails based, as far as I can see, on paranoia. There are proper channels of communication, Miss Li. You have concerns, share them with Professor Jiang. He has my absolute confidence. But if he calls me the mountain is safe, then the mountain is safe. There is unusual activity. I need time to study it. Take all the time you need. Keep studying. That's why you're here. You need to stop the tours today. I need to get a better understanding of what's happening. Listen to me. I know who you are. I know your personal history. You have my utmost sympathy. But you need to understand something. I have a business here with thousands of jobs, and hundreds of millions of dollars are riding on it. I make my decisions based on facts, on data, on hard science, not on intuition, personal feelings. You understand? We're all going to be fine. Mr. Harris, you cannot outrun a 400-mile an hour cloud of burning ash. I've seen what happens to a person when a volcano erupts. You haven't. And I sincerely hope you never will. How's it going? Still calculating. Almost done. Your father called here last night. He called again this morning. Xiao Meng, losing your mother was very hard for him. It was hard for me, too. Hey, here for Jiahui again? You know it. [laughter] How are you? Zheng Nan is here. Come on, come on. Sit down, sit down. Have a seat. Come on. She's just upset about things at work. She'll get over it. Did you find one? Have a look. Whoa. Looks expensive. All right, then. This will do. Ah. What is that? Jiahui's grandmother gave this to me when I took my first voyage at sea. With this, I never get lost. I always find home. So I thought maybe you might get some use from it. No, I can't. That was Jiahui's grandmother's. I shouldn't. Now, you go wait in the car. I'll go talk to her, ah? You know, by "new drone," I thought you meant it was something pocket-sized. It's got HD multispectral imaging, a gravity phase meter thing, ground-penetrating radar just to look far, and a 20-megapixel camera boom, a gyro-stabilizer zoom. Good for you. TENG BO: Hey. Do you not find me dashing? Hmm? Sure, but women still can't stand you. TENG BO: That's why I hit on you! You knew he was coming. Mm-hmm. Xiao Meng, the volcano is showing signs. Please come home with me. [sighs] There's a boat. We can be off the island in two hours. You came all this way just to tell me that? It's not safe here! Well, I'm not leaving. I'm staying like everyone else. Xiao Meng, don't be stubborn with me. I came to bring you back home. This island is extremely dangerous. The data isn't confirmed. Data? This is a volcano. Li Xiao Meng, this isn't a game. All right, stop it. Enough already. This is your famous Zhuque System? Mm-hmm. I don't see surface pressure readings. Or CO2 readings. Here. Tremor foci. Here. Magnetic field densities. Right here. We've place almost 1,000 sensor units, some deep in the mountain. By this time tomorrow, we'll be able to see the data updated in real time. This isn't something people can predict. All these numbers, we don't know how they correlate. And that's why we're trying to study them. It's a volcano. It doesn't love nor hate... It simply builds and then destroys, right? I've heard it so many times. I'm not a child anymore. You pulled me away from anything Mom ever cared about. Xiao Meng. This is my job. I'm not giving it up. TENG BO: Xiao Meng, the chopper's here! You're going up? Mmm. I'm coming with you. [sighs] Whatever. Mommy, come quick! This way, please. Mommy, hurry! I'm coming, I'm coming. QIAN WEI: When my husband first heard about this island, he had a vision for renewal, to bring jobs and opportunities, and to create an escape for today's tourists. Base 2 will provide a new resort area for young families, complete with water park and daycare center. Welcome aboard. Do you have any children, Miss Wang? This resort is our child. Shanshan, so you see? It's beautiful, huh? Uh-huh. Right? It's beautiful. [engine powering up] 3, 2, 1... go. Base station paging Alpha Team, - "Countdown Status" - drone is airborne. Construction took four years. We should recoup our investment by the end of the third quarter. Why? Because volcanoes form mountains. They shouldn't be here. Neither should we. Bringing the cable car through the mountain is one of our engineering team's many accomplishments. This way, please. The observation deck was built with over 200 tons of composite steel. We call it the Bubble. It's made from 120 pieces of ballistic glass to withstand the high temperatures of the magma chamber. We're standing in what may be the safest place on Earth. Once the doors seal, we'll descend 150 meters into the volcano, which is as close as we can get to the lava. This is the survey station where we monitor volcanic activity. Hey, Jiang. I'd never ask you to coddle her, but of all the places, you had to bring her here? She insisted on coming here. Listen to me. She has a chance to make a real difference. She needs you on her side. What? That's right. Like I don't support her enough? What you give her and what she needs are two very different things. [chattering] Here we are. Mommy, Mommy! The most powerful force in the world, nature's spectacle captured and presented as entertainment. TAO: How much is Harris paying you for this? Is it worth it if your actions cost lives? Is it? Hey, what do you mean by that? So what's eating you up? I found a safety issue in the Phase 2 plan, but Harris refuses to hear anything against it. It seems like Xiao Meng noticed the volcano acting up, too. Are you all right? Forget it. I'll be fine. Well, here we are. So my grandpa told you? Eh. [chuckling] Hey! Zheng Nan! What are you doing? Just jump in! Mm-mmm. No one's here. It's just us. Come on, the water's perfect! Fine. Wow. Come on in! Need any help? No need. I got it. [chuckling] I... I'm not here to challenge you. I'm just here to make sure you're safe. If something were to happen to you, it would be... But you were never there. When Mom ran with me down the mountain, you weren't there. The next morning at the hospital, you weren't there. At my college graduation ceremony, you weren't there. On my first assignment in the field, you still weren't there. For every important moment in my life, you were gone. And now you say you want me to leave so I'll be safe? And that's the difference between us. You want me to be safe, but I just want to feel wanted! So I am not going back with you. Finishing the Zhuque System so mankind can monitor volcanoes was Mom's dream. I don't want anyone to go through what I did. I have to finish this. Teng Bo, are we online yet? All crater sensors online, but there's... Xiao Meng, these new sensors are picking up movement on the east slope. [rumbling] Yeah, it's tremors. What does Zhuque say? Micro-tremors inside the mountain. XIAO MENG (ON RADIO): Let's get the tourists out. Call back the helicopter for me. I'm on it. [rumbling] The lava closed off all the exits to the cave. There has to be another way out of here. Mm! Here. I think we need to follow those pipes. Hurry! Base station calling Alpha Team. Xiao Meng, we've got trouble. What is it? TENG BO (ON RADIO): More micro-tremors in the core. The drone is picking up phase readings in the 7-8 range. It's getting hotter. Where's my helicopter? XIAO MENG (ON RADIO): 2 minutes. Attention, everyone! You all need to get off the mountain. Hey, stop that. Why are you yelling at my guests. If you don't leave and someone dies, you'll be liable. I... [rumbling] Everyone, listen up. The volcano is about to erupt! It's very dangerous here. Get on the monorail now, and get off the mountain! [rumbling] Everybody, it's time to leave! It's all right. You're all right. We're OK. You're all right. You're all right. Jiahui! Are you all right? Come here. You're OK. We're OK. We're OK. TENG BO: Oh, no. Xiao Meng, Professor, come back down! The magma is rising fast! The mountain is venting. Professor. You have to get back here, Professor! Run, Professor! PILOT (ON RADIO): Arriving at the island. Ready to land. Stay back, stay back! PILOT (ON RADIO): Calling base, Tianhuo is erupting! I've lost flight control! Request support, request support! MAN: Oh my god! The helicopter exploded! [chattering] [screaming] WOMAN: Look, look up there. Are we safe? Yeah, yeah. No, that's what it's all about, right? Come on, get in. Come on! [screaming] Get up. Go, hurry! Move! Mama. Where are you, Shanshan? Mama! Come here, don't be scared. Move, come on. [screaming] Come on! Follow me! [screaming] [chattering] [screaming] Hurry, hurry up! Get in the... Hurry! Come on, go! Go, hurry. Hurry up! [shouting] Everyone stay calm. Hello? Teng Bo? Teng Bo! TENG BO (ON RADIO): I'm here. Is everyone OK? The volcano is erupting. Are you OK? We have injured in here. Tell the resort to evacuate immediately, one at a time. You get out of there, too. TENG BO (ON RADIO): This is Tianhuo Base Station. To all vessels in the area, please respond. Tianhuo has erupted! Make sure you bring radios and a beacon. Take the skiff and head upwind. You're not coming? They need me. TENG BO (ON RADIO): This is Tianhuo Base Station, calling all vessels in the area, please respond. Please respond! [rumbling] [screaming] Xiao Meng, take my hand! Come on! [electric crackling] Reach! Xiao Meng, grab my hand! Don't be scared. Daddy's here. How big a problem is this, eh? What's happening up there? Oh, Christ. Get all the guests free drinks. Get them away from the pool. Stop... what are you doing? You're managers. Go and manage the problem. Hurry up and go! Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Do we have a security team on the way? Should we wait for the monorail to... Don't wait for anything. Send a team up there, and make sure they know where my wife is. Yes, sir. Security team, come in. Where's... there's the picture? Hurry, follow me! Go, 1, 2, 3... go! Come on! Jump! Hurry up! Jump! Go! [screaming] Go! This one is to drive. This is to brake. You can do this! Oh, no. We can't stay in this car! Everyone, in the other car! Open up! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Count the interval. It's 5 seconds. OK. You first. [whimpering] [screaming] Next! You, come here. Take a breath. Don't be scared. Ready? [screaming] Don't worry. Hurry up. Jump already. Ready? [crackling] [clank] [screaming] You have to jump! We're out of time! I can't. It's too late! [groaning] JIAHUI: Look! [screaming] Yeah, yes! Let's check! Xiao Meng! - Xiao Meng. - We got you. Are you OK? Hold on! [panicked shouting] Qian Wei! Qian Wei! Qian Wei. Wait, did you see the other car leave? No, no. I don't know. I don't know! Come on. You're all OK? No chit-chat. Let's get out of here. You still drive this? Whoa. That your dad? Uh-huh. Now I know where you got that temper of yours. Get in the car! Let's go! Everybody in! TENG BO (ON RADIO): Xiao Meng. I'm here. What's the situation? Zhuque is sending updates. The core is shifting fast. The drone shows a group of villagers trapped by the lava. Lava flow is moving towards them, and they have no way out. JIAHUI. But my grandpa is in the village. I have to go get him. TAO: No, we save ourselves. Let's get you to safety. Teng Bo, how much time do we have left? An hour, max. That's not enough time. Lightning, landslides, gas clouds... the surface will be burned clean. We have to leave now. I'm not leaving. I can't leave him behind. Who will help the villagers if we leave? Teng Bo, find us a route to access the village. TENG BO (ON RADIO): Copy that. TAO: You're crazy. Everyone, hold on. Please. Please, everybody listen! Don't panic! The boats are that way. There's boats for everybody. There's plenty of room for everyone. So don't panic. Just leave your luggage behind. Just move fast. That way to the boats! [explosion] [screaming] Shit! [screaming] [explosion] XIAO MENG (VOICEOVER): Mr. Harris, you cannot outrun a 400-mile an hour cloud of burning ash. I've seen what happens to a person when a volcano erupts. You haven't. And I sincerely hope you never will. [engine struggling] Come on! [engine struggling] Get out. My husband, he's still at the resort. You take a look at what you've done, how many lives you've put in danger. This is the consequence of your arrogance! It's not a natural disaster. It's man-made! [explosion] TENG BO (ON RADIO): Xiao Meng, what's your status? The magma's flown through the river. The roads into the village have all been destroyed. The resort guests are evacuated right now. You should get off the mountain, before it's too late! XIAO MENG (ON RADIO): No, if the lava hits the water level, every person in that village is dead. We have to find a way to get them out safely. What if... are the geothermal pipes linked to the reservoirs? That's right. If we could drain the southern reservoir... That would divert the blast away. TENG BO (ON RADIO): Teng Bo, you know what I'm thinking, don't you? You want to pump groundwater into the reservoir, to trigger the dam's automatic release mechanism. Where can we find the pumps? The Northwest Geothermal Station. Can you operate it? I think so. I've seen people do it. But without the key card, we can't get in. I have the code. REPORTER (ON TV): Famous Southeast Asian tourist destination Tianhuo Island has just experienced a severe volcanic eruption. The local government and institutions have the highest state of emergency. There are reported to be at least 50,000 residents trapped on the island, who are now in mortal danger. The eruption of Tianhuo happened without warning. [speaking japanese] [speaking french] "Breaking News: Tianhuo Island volcano eruption caught the world's attention." ...from their loved ones have waited anxiously, fearing the worst. GIRL: Mama? Mama, [speaking chinese] where are you? Mama! Mama! Mama. [sobbing] [sobbing] It's OK. Hey, oi. [speaking chinese] Where is your mama? Your mama was wearing red, right? Red. That's right. She was wearing red. What's your name? My name is Jack? What's your name? My name is Shanshan. OK, Shanshan, shall we go and get safe, yeah? Come on, come on. Shit. [explosion] Don't be scared. I've got my lucky watch here. Listen very carefully. If you hear something... here, take it. Put it to your ear. [speaking chinese] What do you hear? Don't look, just listen. [explosion] [screaming] Wait! Wait! Mr. Harris, quick! Quick, give me the kid! Come on, hand her to me. Thank you. Get in, Mr. Harris! [shouting] Please don't go! Stay with me! My wife is here. I'm not going without my wife. No! No, go, go, go! No! Keep listening. You have to listen carefully. You'll be fine. [heart beating] Can you hear it? I hear it. What is it? What can you hear? A heart beat. That's right. It's all heart beat. Now you'll be lucky forever! XIAO MENG (ON RADIO): Teng Bo, can Zhuque see the southern reservoir? TENG BO (ON RADIO): Yes, but if we really drain the southern reservoir, you know what happens, right? I know. We'll be right in the blast range. TAO: You're sure about this? Mm-hmm. What the hell? TENG BO (ON RADIO): Xiao Meng, Xiao Meng. I'm picking up something behind you. The heat signature's huge. I can't see exactly what it is through the ash cloud, but it's moving really fast. Stop the car. Lava flow. [explosion] Drive, hurry! Hold on tight! It's getting closer. Hurry, faster! Oh, shit. [groaning] The car's on fire! That gas can's gonna blow. Get rid of it. Xiao Meng, come back! Hold on! Xiao Meng! TENG BO: This is Tianhuo Base Station. Calling all boats in the vicinity. We require emergency evacuation. Please respond, please respond! MAN (ON RADIO): This is Huaxia calling Tianhuo Base. We're directly south of you. We'll be there in about two hours! Yes! TENG BO (ON RADIO): Xiao Meng, a rescue team is on the way. Did you hear me? A rescue team will be here in two hours! Copy. We're en route to the geothermal station. Xiao Meng, you better hurry. The lava is about to reach the village. Teng Bo, we're here. You're out of time. The magma is headed towards the southern reservoir. Jiahui, what do we need to do? We need to open the release valve. That's the release valve? Yeah, that's the one. Teng Bo, I need to borrow your drone. XIAO MENG (ON RADIO): We need you now. The window on the roof, hit it at full speed! The drone comes with afterburners. I'm guessing you want them, too? Go full power! Roger. There it is. - Go! - Let's go! Let's go! [electric crackle] [explosion] REPORTER (ON TV): We have just received reports, water released from the dam may change the course of the lava flow. There is hope for thousands of villagers to be rescued. However, geologists state that it is unknown whether the eruption will trigger a chain reaction. TENG BO (ON RADIO): Xiao Meng, the volcano is going pyroclastic. You need to get away now. Xiao Meng, can you hear me? Xiao Meng? Xiao Meng! Drive slower, moron. Hey, I got it. It's the engine. The ash will clog the radiator. [beeping] Yup, it's overheated. Zheng Nan. What is it? I have to go back and get my grandpa. But we can't just make them wait for us here. Then I'll go by myself. Hey. It's not safe. I'll go with you. How do we fix this? We're going back to get my grandpa. We can't just leave him behind to die. Be quick about it. We'll come find you once the engine cools down. Come on, let's hurry. Static electricity from the carbon int he air. Mom told me about this when I was little. Never thought I'd see it myself. Your mom and I saw it together once before. Parrot Rock? Hmm. I wish Mom was still here with us. Grandpa, Grandpa! Grandpa! Hurry! Grandpa? [coughing] Grandpa, Grandpa! Grandpa. Jiahui. Grandpa. You're not supposed to be here. I'm here for you. Jiahui... We're taking you with us. [coughing] I don't think I can walk. Jiahui, be brave. My boat has come for me. Seeing you one last time makes me so happy. Zheng Nan. Grandpa, I'm here. You must take Jiahui to safety. Take good care of her. Mm. Yeah, I will. Jiahui... [sobbing] Let's go! Zheng Nan, there's no way out of here. I'm right here. Come on. We'll find a way. [sobbing] Get in the car! Go, hurry! [sobbing] It's OK. It's OK. It's all gonna be OK. Xiao Meng, the lava is approaching the Base Station. Where are you guys? Respond! [rumbling] Damn it. We're stuck. Ah, we're burning! TAO: Lift up your feet! QIAN WEI: Come on, do something, so something! I got this. JIAHUI: Be careful! Reverse! Reverse the winch now! Zheng Nan, hold on! Everyone, hold on! Oh no, we're going to fall! We're falling! We're gonna fall! [screaming] Everyone out! Give me your hand. Hold on! Give me your hand! Don't look down! OK. TAO: You go first. I'll follow! [groaning] HUAXIA (ON RADIO): This is Huaxia, Tianhuo Base, come in. Tianhuo Base, come in! This is Tianhuo Base. I copy. Go ahead. HUAXIA (ON RADIO): Helicopter ETA... 15 minutes. We'll touch down on the south beach. Copy. Xiao Meng, respond if you hear this. I'm right here. Get me a medical kit. My dad's hurt. Coming right up. Open your hand a little more. We're almost done. There. Forgive me. Xiao Meng, Xiao Meng! XIAO MENG: Mom, Mom! I was so scared. So was I. I've always regretted that I wasn't there with you two. I never imagined that what would happen was... [crying] First thing the next morning, I went to look for her. And I swore I would bring her home. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I wasn't with you. I have already lost your mother. I can't lose you, too. Dad. Been a long time since you called me that. [chuckling] [crying] We're running out of time. Gotta leave soon. [alarm beeping] Xiao Meng, she's about to blow. Leave everything behind. Leave now. Run! Go across the bridge, run! Keep running! Hurry! Go! Hurry! You first, I'm right behind you. Professor, hurry up! Hurry! Dad! Keep moving! XIAO MENG: Dad! TENG BO: Professor! Professor! [groaning] Dad! I'm going to get the helicopter! We'll be back for you! TAO (ON RADIO): I'll wait for you. Xiao Meng, there's no time! Hurry up! Dad! TENG BO: We gotta go! Dad, wait for me! We have to move! TENG BO: Xiao Meng, there's no time! Xiao Meng! Come on, let's go! HUAXIA (ON RADIO): I'm at Tianhuo Island. The island is in front of us. Landing in 5 minutes. Come on. Hurry. Keep up! Hurry, Jiahui! Keep up! [explosion] Hey! Hey! Here! Hurry up! Go in! My dad's at the Base Station. I have to go save him! It's too dangerous now. I need to go back. Xiao Meng! XIAO MENG: Let me go! Let me go back! MAN (ON RADIO): Calling Huaxia, calling Huaxia! We are returning to Tianhuo Base Station. We are encountering further eruptions. I repeat, further eruptions! It's my dad! Dad! Dad! I'm sorry about this, Dad. You shouldn't have come for me. I'm sorry. REPORTER (ON TV): We continue with more breaking reports from Tianhuo Island. After the volcanic eruption on Tianhuo, volunteer rescue teams from nearby communities are mounting the first emergency search for survivors, bravely fighting to save lives. The national government, in coordination with neighboring countries, has rapidly formed a rescue response framework, and rescue teams are being dispatched to Tianhuo Island. Thus far, work has proceeded smoothly. You still have me. Everything will be fine. Excuse me, can I see your watch? The man who gave you this watch, was he on the same boat with you?
