I did not know. His face. I saw him somewhere another place. "At night all red-skinned brown. " No, I have a feeling that I ... We have to leave now. Kronk, bring the horses. At night. Aren't we going to sleep? It's not healthy to cross the Comanche territory during the day. So we will travel at night. We travel while they sleep, right? Yes. Comanches believe that The moon is an evil spirit. "It scares them to travel at night. They will be old-fashioned Indians. " Well, the sun is already rising. It's time to rest. Sam Hollis, look! There are many there. Look What's up with you, Baldy? I thought I saw a Group of Comanche warriors. Someday I'll have a herd like that. It is my dream. Are you crazy?

We better leave as soon as possible. Without sleep. Crazy partner. We will pass the Comanche cemetery. - They think it's haunted. - It's haunted. "Look like painting on the poster." "But just don't say he's crazy." Come on, let's not waste time. What poster? Now I know where I saw him before. In front of the soldiers. You brought them. And you knew everything. What does it matter now? You escaped from them, right? You are not my friend. My escape was a Dishonorable trick. Just because you I needed a bodyguard. A bodyguard, no, Baldy. Someone to take care of the revolvers. These settlers of Moccasin Flat ... Why did you do such a thing? Because I don't have gloves. Okay, buddy, we're even. Let's ride! I just got two slaps in my life. One of my mother. The other, of a kind that was buried the same day. No one who cheats on a Baldasar is still alive. We will have a duel.

Go get the horses. You are a very woman brave and generous. Give her flowers. But on which horse will she ride? In none. Comanches won't be very kind to us after we disturb your Sacrifice ceremony. I will not leave the girl. Will not be happy until killed us, didn't you, Baldy? Get on the horse. I won't leave her here to die. "Look! Smoke!" That say? What do you mean ...? Always read the signs of smoke. "Just read Kronk language." "Comanches talk of departure to war. " Speak our language! What war? "I live village of white many years. " What war? "Comanches burn village, kill cattle, arrest me. " What war? "Comanches talk about cattle that comes from the east. " It's our pack, coming from Louisiana. Let's go straight Moccasin Flat and we'll be back with some men. They go without me. I get ready. You? Walk in circles before night falls. "I guide him to white town. " Alright. But keep an eye on this India. At the first opportunity, she will turn against you. I apologize for my mate. He is not a gentleman. What? If it was one, yourself would have apologized. I don't have time to argue. Sam Hollis, you were willing to extract me the poison and I am grateful to you for that. I want to keep you alive for That's one reason, Baldy. Settle our accounts in Moccasin Flat. Let me introduce myself. I'm Don Andrea Baldasar, Duke of Casala. "I call myself Lonetta." Lonetta, It's a pleasure to meet you. Warriors, get up! Get ready! Hi Sam. What are you doing so far from the village? And you, who do camping in broad daylight? We have no choice, The cattle are exhausted. As you can see, they are corral reses. The long walk exhausted them. Five have already died. If you do not want the arrows do away with the rest, We must leave. The Comanches are coming here. Comanches? Raise camp! Where is my son? Let's go! Move, Hank, move. If you need help, let me know. When you're done, help others. Ready, Floyd? Almost. That one is missing blessed girl! Girl? What girl? My cousin's daughter Shreveport Rich. He joined us at the border. Why? A beast was killed because of you and she decided to move away until things calm down. And where the hell is she? The last time I saw her, I was going to Direction to the source, behind the trees. Rubs so much with the sponge that should not be left over nothing but bones. Get out, miss. It is already quite clean. Hurry up, let's go. Get out soon. I can't, I'm naked. For close your eyes. I won't move until you see it. If you want the Comanches Take her, stay there. The Comanches? Wait. Hurry up. You can turn your back, while I dress? It is not. What is not? My clothes. Someone took her. Where did you leave her? In these bushes. There is nothing here. These thief comanches. It's better that you leave, and quickly. Without clothes I will not leave. Do the following: The third car ÔøΩ by Floyd Willet. It's my mother's cousin. You will find in my chest that my cousin Floyd will show youÔøΩ, - a beautiful green dress with ... - Shut up and put this on. This disgusting thing? What do you want me to ...? What do you think you are doing? Do not approach. Stay away from me. Don't you dare touch me. Who do you think you are? The name is Sam Hollis, Miss. It is evident that you It's not a gentleman. It is evident that you neither is it. You are my son. One day I will take my place. How to lead the tribe if ever do nothing right? Sorry, daddy. Lonetta, that's not right. The lady must go on the horse. I will be walking. "No, you keep going bad." The miracle herbs that you put on my leg ended the inflammation. Not yet. Wait another day. In this case, we will the two on horseback. "If that's your wish." When we get to Moccasin Flat, what do you want to do? "Whatever you want me to do." Whatever I want? "You save me from pagan." You owe me nothing for it. "I owe my life." "I do anything for you." But Lonetta, this ... Anything. That. Hold on tight not to fall. Hi Kronk No? Want to bet? Good night, Miss Naylor. It's dangerous to walk alone at night. Comanches move very fast. For us settlers, nothing more precious than a beautiful woman. Except cattle, of course. So maybe I'm happier accompanied by a cow, mr. Hollis If there is any Indian hidden inside, scream. It's all right, miss. I just wanted to know if I was hold it in here. Well, good night, mr. Hollis Good night, Miss. Get down. What happened? The Comanches. What will we do? I will think of something. Do not get up. But it's your friend. I have no Comanche friend. It's your mate. It's true. At night all the redskins They're brown, aren't they? Get out of here. How we will know each other better if we don't live together? I said get out of here. But if I'm so fine by your side... They just slapped me two ... No, five ... six times in all my life. Seven. Mr. Hollis, I never found Someone as rude as you. I just wanted to ... I know very well what I wanted. "Something go wrong?" Why wasn't Comanche born? "Mother runs very fast." I'll be back in a moment. Let me introduce myself. I'm Don Andrea Baldasar, Duke of Casala. Nice to meet you, friend. Welcome to Moccasin Flat. I'm Cy Morton, that one Henry Williams and this ÔøΩ ... You must be the person of who Sam Hollis told us about. Between the snake bite and the Comanches, - We thought you were dead. - Sam Hollis is here? He went to protect the caravan that brings the cattle. I should go back today. If they didn't scalp it. Can I help you with something, friend? I came to meet someone here. A lady who hails from the United States. Maybe you asked for me. Not that I know of. This is Texas, right? Yes. It is possible that is there another Texas? If there were more than one, no there would be room for nothing more. Comanches! Comanche! Comanche! Comanche! It comes riding in zigzag. Because you want to talk. Cover me. If he starts looking at My hair, be ready. We want the girl. What did he say? Calm calm. They just want this Indian girl. Where did she come from? She rode with him. They want us to give it back. They say it belongs to them. But, to kill her. If we don't deliver it, will come for her. No, I will not allow it. Have you seen these Comanches wild when they attack? We have to hand it over. We have to think about our children. The Indians do not like to wait. It would be different if Sam and the others were here. May she come back to her people. Let's not risk it our skin for her. They have no dignity, no honor? I don't know what he said but are the words threatening things I've heard. Exactly, I challenge for a duel. And to all of you. Let him, Luke, India is gone. Are you crazy? They'll cut him off like a ram. Why doesn't he let them take her? Leave? Would you let to take me? Lonetta, why did you choose to die? "You come back or Indians Believe that you challenge them. " But only a coward would! Lonetta "You come back or they kill you." White man challenges us. We will send the bravest. Yellow knife. Son without fear will fight with pale face. Bring your scalp. Please. I will, father. Run away To run away? A baldasar? Never. Get in the car. With you, I suppose. Thanks for the invitation, but I hear gunshots coming from Moccasin Flat. See You are a beginner of the most morons I've seen. Wanting to fight alone with the whole tribe. When someone fights alone, must fight for a battalion. Take revenge. Kill the challenger. I'm glad to see you whole, Mr. HerÔøΩi. We have a subject pending to hit. Forgive me, Sam Hollis. "Comanches go up hill". "Why look so funny?" ... and if you laugh, I'll kick you who will send it to the middle of your tribe. I don't laugh at your pain and yes of the place. Since there is so much sense of humor, baldy, think of something funny for your epitaph. Do not be afraid. If they touch her ... Calm down, man. We want to remove some Things we said. After seeing him face these Indians we would be proud if stay at Moccasin Flat. I accept your apologies. We think to add at our invitation 1,000 acres of excellent Texan land as a gift. 1,000 acres? We know it's a little but, It's already a start. They are very generous. Of course a land without cattle is not worth much. See that caravan? Five of those cows It's for you, too. And I will give you the bull. Form a herd It has always been my dream. I feel I have to wake him up. Why do you say that, Floyd? We left a trail of dead people along the way. And it will be a miracle if there is Ten animals at night. I understand. Sorry, outsider. His intentions were very noble. "You have cattle". Lonetta, didn't you hear what they said? "More cattle than can dream." "Boss feather. Great honor get hurt by boss ". Yes, and if they return to give me this honor I will have to ride upside down. "Why be mad at me?" I'm not mad, I'm sore. "White man talk to language bent ". What the hell do you want say with that? I? "Be old Indian saying". "Old Indians say that." Cousin Floyd, do you think any of these gentlemen would be willing to unload my stuff? Yes ma'am My cousin Floyd will tell you where to take them. "Come. Sam Hollis sick. He say your name ". What did you say? "Being hurt without a doctor". Injured? "Be the target of an arrow". Where? "In the ... part of three". "I go". "Can't see friend suffer". Phoebe Ann. I'm here, Mr. Hollis. Who are you? Mom, are you? Mom! No, it's me, Mr. Hollis Miss Naylor. Phoebe Ann Naylor. Miss Naylor, all right? The Indians didn't catch her? No, I'm saved, thanks. Last night in the wagon forgive me the freedoms that ... Phoebe Ann. Poor thing. Don't see yourself. Don't see yourself. Where are you? - Phoebe Ann. - I'm here. The Comanches! I have to protect Phoebe Ann. The beautiful Phoebe Ann. Get away from her, your fucking redskins! Wake up, Sam .. Mr. Hollis. You're safe in the village. Mom! This is not cattle, Lonetta, They are 'wide horns'. We will tame them. This is impossible. Sam Hollis says that ... "White man not knowing of many things ". "When dark, separate six in the pack. " "With these six, start to realize your dream. " Now it is you who are dreaming. How can only one man and a woman do this? "A man and a woman to be enough for many things ". We will do it. How? With fire and water. "With fire, separate 'wide horns' of the pack ". "They stay three days and three nights without drinking ". "On the fourth day, give them water." On the fourth day they will be dead. No, they will be tame. "Know secret that all Comanches know ". Hopefully the 'wide horns' know it too. Did it hurt? "Having to stop them. They feel presence of water ". What water? "Behind the hill shall there will be water of death ". "Black water, if they drink, they will die. " Let's get out of here! Quickly! "If they drink, they die." Run, Lonetta, run. What water is that burning? "When digging earth, sometimes come out of this black poison ". "To be the curse of Texas." I pray to God that on my 1,000 acres Let's not find this black poison. Lonetta, be careful. Don't worry, they're all tamed. We did it. You did it. "White man know secret". "With tamed 'wide horns', others will come, with more rifles. " "We must destroy village." Good thinking, Dad. 'Make smoke'. "Tell all the tribes gather warriors to ... ' - Monkeys bite me if ... - Me too. But that is not possible. I didn't think so either. But Lonetta knew better than us. Three days without water and they will eat in your hand! Have you thought? We can have all the 'wide horns' we want. This means that each Settler will have his pack. I'm starting to feel rich. It was a lucky day for Moccasin Flat when you arrived, friend. I mean, Mr. Baldasar. But it was Lonetta who ... Baldasar? You Duke Phoebe Ann looking everywhere? Phoebe Ann? Are you here? Where? Spends most of the time with ... At the Trading Post. Lonetta, did you hear? It's here. My future wife. Let's go. I had never heard of from anyone who had spent three days raving. "Comanches never use clean arrows ". Comanches! They are behind us! Calm down, Sam, there are no commanches here. Mom. No, Sam, I'm Phoebe Ann. Miss Naylor, are you? Will I never get well? No, if you lie down. Overeating him not will help in your recovery. Pamper me, Miss? If you don't try to get up, don't I can do nothing more for you. Yes, I'm ready. I mean ... I'll fight against the disease. Even if it kills me. Mommy, Mommy! I have to protect Phoebe Ann. I have to protect Phoebe Ann. Calm down, Sam. The young American, where are you? I will surprise you. Yes. I have to protect Phoebe Ann. Sam! Sam! Don. Sweetie ... Can't beat before entering? Sorry, I didn't know that ... Phoebe Ann, what does this mean? Andrea, honey, no what are you thinking. My eyes are not mistaken. Honey, you don't have to give explanations to him. Do you know each other? He called her dear. Of course I do not see that he ...? Why are you so wet? Lonetta entered the river after taming the cattle. I don't think it was the only one thing she tamed. What cattle? You are here with my future wife and dares ... Who is Lonetta? He and she have been together. - Your future wife? - Lonetta is an India ... Are you crazy, Baldy? She is my girl. - Lonetta is your girl? - No, you are my girl. - Who is Lonetta? - Are you his girl? The most beautiful India that you've seen. They were together for three days and three nights. And you come in here, making accusations? I'm not your girl. Of course, since that night in the big car. What night in the car? It was four nights ago. - Lie. - Was it five? Four. But he is not well. Sometimes you think I'm your mother. It seemed to me that he was your father. He didn't hug her as if were your son. I was sick. He hasn't eaten for several days since that an arrow hit him in the leg. On the leg? The arrow hit straight into the ... Measure your words, Baldy, There is a lady present. This is not a punch of a sick man. You are healthy, and so am I. We will duel now. I have my revolver. A duel? No! Don't worry about me, all will be well. You um ... A bit disorganized but I have everything by hand. Thanks. Kronk, lend him your six-shot revolver. One shot will be enough. Because I intend to use all six. No, Andrea, Sam, no, please. Prepare the drink, guys. Take the violins and play as high as they can. What's happening, grandma? ÔøΩ we have to put the biggest flag on the highest mast, and in the biggest hole. This is what is happening. We are citizens of the largest and most new state of the Union, Texas. Get ready for the ceremony, friends. Here comes the cavalry from United States. The Cavalry! Run away, Andrea, run away or they will shoot him. - Look, don't you look like ...? - Yes, no doubt. - This time he doesn't ... - Of course not. Run away I refuse. - A man of honor ... - They have a lot of rifles. She is right. You must be Lonetta. God, Andrea, I don't want to to be a widow before being married. Okay, I will. But not because of you. - And yes because a woman's desire ... - I know. - ... it's sacred. - I know. ÔøΩ him! Baldasar! Ahead, air! It was not a ceremony too long, isn't it? Phoebe Ann, this man that Baldasar killed It wasn't Cavalry, was it? What a shame! I fought with the Indians, tamed bulls, was a good man. We have to think of something worthy to put on your headstone. You're right. Taking the will that I had to kill him, I liked poor Baldy. I have the sad feeling that I will not see him again. Come on, Phoebe Ann, Let me take you home. He was a wonderful person. Yes, and I will kill who say otherwise. Mr. Hollis ... Sam ... you It is a great comfort to me. You so good. "See and not believe". Ahead, air! Loud, air! Ahead, air! Are you sure I can't do nothing for you? Yes, thanks. Sam, can I talk to you? Excuse me, miss? Since there won't be flag raising ceremony, we should capture some 'wide horns'. See you in the front; I will reach them. But we will need the everyone's help, Sam. The least we can do for this brave ÔøΩ realize your dreams. Great idea, friends. Take as long as it takes, we'll take all the animals we find. It's the least we can do for poor Baldy. That angry boy. Okay, Hank, bring them here. Come on, bring them here. Ahead, air! "Better to tie well gate." Why do you say that? "You let them drink second day. "Wild again". Wild? They are so tamed that they would close the gate themselves. "Baldy say three days." What Baldy Does in Three Days I can do it in less time. And, some things, even faster. Some things, maybe never. Floyd, Cy. Bring the wagons and form barricades with them. Fast. What the hell are you doing? "Dance the rain". For what? "If Comanches get wet, Maybe they'll dry at home. Dance if you want, but don't scream. "Indian always scream in war". Why? And why not? "The bravest IanÔøΩar arrow in Flames to the sky. Attack signal ". Enjoy the bullets well. "Yes. Indian good to be Indian dead." "Kronk make a joke". Kronk, go get the Cavalry. "Cavalry go to the mountain of Comanches ". Well, go get it. "Be a lot of Comanches and I'm one." You just have to keep your eyes open and walk down. Lowered how much? Forget it. Not bad. Sam, I'm afraid. Fear? And who doesn't? I don't know how to do that but keep doing it. Sam, the school! Maybe the Cavalry sees the smoke. He thinks not. Ahead, air! Lonetta for two days You helped me get away from them. However, it has said very little. Did I say something that offended you? So why don't you talk? "Indian woman knows how to keep silence". If only you would tell me why. Okay, I won't ask you anything. Ask. So, there is something. What is it? "A man look at many things". "But sometimes not seeing what be before your eyes ". It's true, Lonetta. In my life I've met men like that. "A fire in the open field produce flames, smoke ". "That you can see." Sure. "An internal fire not produce flames, nor smoke ". "But burn the same way." An inner fire? "Have fire inside me". "You don't see, but it burns for you." By me? "And stronger than fire to have in the village. What fire? Comanches. And the soldiers, like Didn't you see this smoke? "They only have eyes to follow your footsteps ". "And chase you like a coyote."

The jurors dug it earlier to start the trial. Attention! But Rodney, you can't kill such a man like that. It was an impartial judgment. Impartial? Being you the judge and Howard the defense attorney? Every man has a right to a lawyer. - Don Andrea. - Quiet! Please. "Indian way of saying goodbye". Ahead, air! But, I swear he was not to blame. If Howard hadn't pushed the door, Andrea would never have YanÔøΩado Yancy over the counter. Phoebe Ann, you well know that no cavalry officer from the United States would be let surprise in such a stance. Of course not. It's the most history ridiculous I've heard in my life.

Tell me which side From the village you want to come. Which side of the town? Don't make a fool of yourself. Want to come this way or that side? No, you look like this, I look like this and then ... Back with back? What a way to duel this one? Please duel many times in Spain and ... This is not Spain. It's Texas. One can even perform a duel in a civilized way. Our civilized form to kill us is this. I come from one end of the village, like this. You come from the other and when you find that's the moment, pull out the revolver. And we have to walk it all, to come back later, when are we here? What a stupidity! Why stupidity? How We always did. Why? Because it was always done thus here in the west. There is no need to scream. Even in the face of death, behave like a gentleman. Which side of town do you want to come? Do you really want to walk all this? Yes! What are you waiting for? May you begin. Baldy, you and me we live many adventures together and actually I don't have desire to kill him. I don't feel like it either to riddle you with bullets, Sam Hollis.

They can rob me and loot me, can stab me or, even shoot me, I'll be happy if I'm there, across the river in Texas. Across the river in Texas. Translated and Corrected by ElWoOdBlUes - 2019
