This is a plaque to Clark Ashton Smith. And on it is 10 lines of a short poem, The Sorcerer Departs, which could be the first draft of Soliloquy in an Ebon Tower, a finished poem. I pass, but in this lone and crumbling tower builded against the burrowing seas of chaos, my volumes and my philters shall abide. Poisons more dear than any mithridate, and spells far sweeter than the speech of love, half-shapen dooms shall slumber in my vaults, and in my volumes, cryptic runes that shall outblast the pestilence, outgnaw the worm, when loosed by alien wizards on strange years, under the blackened moon and paling sun. Well, so far, some of that prophecy he made about his own work has indeed come true. I doubt though that Smith will ever be a household name. Nonetheless, this is a lovely prophecy, and as I said, so far it seems to be coming true. His work has made its way on its own merit. He doesn't have any big sponsors or patrons or corporations behind him. He represents himself, the individual and individualist supreme. Clark Ashton Smith is the unsung poet of the mother lode, foothills and gold country of northern California. His work as a fantasy writer has garnered him worldwide acclaim for its excellence and distinctness. He has been called 'sui generis', the one and only. And his many devotees refer to him as the Emperor of Dreams. An intensely private man, even in letters to his closest friends he was guarded about intimate details of his life. He left no memoirs, and no film footage of him survives. Much about him will always be shrouded in mystery and legend. He explored the most remote realms of the imagination, and he mined it, not for gold, but something far more precious, beauty. To read Clark Ashton Smith, is to be washed over by a tsunami, that colors you a million different ways. Just a page of Clark Ashton Smith is better than an entire book by most writers. He was magic itself. He was the voice of magic. To the ancient Egyptians, the west symbolized the destination of the dead. The direction of their souls' hazardous pilgrimage on its quest for immortality, where the sun died and was reborn each day. The Celtic otherworld lay beyond the horizon of the western sea. The Americans of the 19th century would not be denied their own mythology of the west. Even before the pastoral arcadia of Alta California had officially become a state in 1850, Americans were scrambling to the west, by sea and by land. James Marshall had discovered gold in Coloma. The sudden influx of migrants and gold-seekers changed the region, quickly, and forever. The spirit of the age was manifest destiny, and America would expand at all costs, from sea to shining sea. Or as Smith phrased it, from shore to crumbled shore. A few miles farther up the river from Coloma, Claude Chana discovered gold is what is now the Auburn Ravine, and Auburn was born. In 1893, the year of Smith's birth, Auburn was a lonely mountain village with around a thousand inhabitants. It was transitioning from the mining town of the early days of California. Clark was born on a Friday the 13th, a few miles out of town, in his maternal grandparents' home. I'm standing by the front door of the house in which Clark Ashton Smith was born. However, the house has been altered since the Gaylord family, his mother was Fanny Gaylord, lived here. The house is slated for demolition, and a large mansion will rise in its place. This is the very large camphor tree that serves to identify the former Gaylord house. I first learned to identify the property by this tree. Genevieve K. Sully, who was a very close friend to Smith, was the one that gave me the information. Here we stand by the front door of what was at one time the Long Valley School, the little red schoolhouse of the district. Smith was born in 1893. This place was opened as a school about 1890, so he would have come here when he was about five or six, which would have been in the latter 1890's. And he went to this school for a while, but then finished up at the grammar school in Auburn. The building is still there. He did not go on to high school, figuring, and his parents agreed with him, that he could do a better job educating himself. So Smith truly is an autodidact. Meanwhile, it's a nice thought that early on he went to an institution that existed all over the United States, a little schoolhouse that covered the early grades. Of his early schooling, Smith would write, I believe I was distinguished more for devilment than scholarship. He began to write fairy tales around age 10. His first poem shows an early inclination towards rhyme, and a deep love for his mother. He was teased in elementary school quite a bit, because he was smart. The story is that he attended one day of high school, and it was just unbearable for him. And he came home and said, I'm not going back, and his parents said okay, and just proceeded to basically self-educate himself. Smith was not a normal intellect, he really wasn't. I think he had what they call eidetic, or photographic memory, not so much I think in the visual sense, but he apparently retained everything he read. Apparently he was like seven years old when his father, he was born down in Long Valley, just down the hill from Auburn, and right by the schoolhouse, and the father purchased the 40 acres up there, and then they built the cabin. Smith was about seven years old, and apparently he helped him with whatever he could do at that age. It was simple, there was no water, running water or electricity. There was an old man shaft, there was like ladders going down, and they got their water from there I believe, and it was like the cooler, sort of thing. Primitive, really. The Smith cabin was located just a mile or two from old town Auburn. That distance was his buffer from a quickly modernizing world. He lived there for 50 years. No running water, no electricity, no vehicle. Lin Carter called it a sort of self-imposed exile from his century. It was a nice spot. They had a view of the Sacramento Valley to the west, the Sierra Nevada Mountains to the east. This is the library that Clark Ashton Smith knew all his life. It was opened in 19 ought 9, built on a grant from the Andrew Carnegie Corporation. According to different accounts, he once read virtually every book that was in the library, at that time, which if that is true that is a remarkable feat. I guess it would have been fairly well stocked for the period in which he lived. So, it was a major source of education for him. Books were Smith's refuge as a sensitive boy in a rugged rural town. It was in a grammar school library at 13, that Smith first discovered Poe, whose poetry and prose was an immediate and lifelong fascination and influence, along with the Arabian Nights. He wasn't literally an outsider, he lived outside Auburn with his family, and he was not used to being around people. That's why early on he seemed shy to people. Or diffident? Well, it's like a wild creature is quite diffident, around entities it does not know. I think there's something comparable to that in Smith's, he gradually gained confidence being with people, but I think he chose with great care the people with whom he wanted to be associated. He was first published in professional magazines at just 17 years old. The Overland Monthly. His poem, Moonlight, was in the August 1910 issue. Later that year, he would publish short fiction in The Black Cat. And in January of 1911, with the help of a school teacher friend, he would be put into contact with his idol, poet, George Sterling. Sterling not only responded, but was dazzled by the young poet's early work. Sterling was a central figure in California literature around the turn of the century. His mentor was Ambrose Bierce, and his best friend, Jack London. His works were visionary, expertly crafted, and he was ranked with the giants of romantic poetry. Well, Smith just wrote to him out of the blue, in early 1911 I believe. We don't actually have the first few letters that Smith wrote to Sterling, but it's clear that Smith not only wrote to him but sent him some of his poetry, that he was writing at the time. I think Smith discovered Sterling as early as around 1907, or thereabouts. In fact, that was when Sterling had become really famous, because his great poem, A Wine of Wizardry, had appeared in Cosmopolitan magazine, under Bierce's influence, and created a huge furor, and I'm sure Smith was aware of that, because it was the kind of poetry that Smith himself was writing, or wanted to write. And so when Sterling received these early poems of Smith, I think he did a sort of deja vu sort of thing, because it was as if he was now the mentor to this young poet, just as he had been the young poet being mentored by Bierce, about a decade or so earlier. Sterling arranged for the young poet to visit him, in Carmel, in the summer of 1912, for a month-long sojourn. He help Sterling write the famous Abalone Song, and the two saw a performance of Alice in Wonderland together. On the return trip, Smith stopped in San Francisco to sit for portrait photographer, Bianca Conte. Smith would remark, to me the eye of the camera always looks like the mysterious muzzle of a 13 inch gun, and I am out to look like the enemy. Of Smith's first book, The Star-Treader and other Poems, Donald Wandrei would remark, it shows the effects of imagination in its first exuberance. Stars, suns, and comets parade in all their majesty. Chaos, infinity, and the eldritch dark, are ever-present. And the wonder, the inexplicable mystery of the universe form the background of the book. Published in 1912, when he was just 19 years old, Star-Treader sold well regionally, and garnered worldwide attention. He was called, The Keats of the West Coast. There was the most serious attention from the mainstream literary world that he would get in his lifetime. The problem with Smith was that he didn't really produce a lot. In those early years from say 1912 to like 1920, he was in pretty bad health for various reasons, may have had tuberculosis, may have been slightly depressed also. He was very shy, he didn't get out much. In fact, Sterling wanted him in 1912 to come San Francisco to meet Ambrose Bierce, who was making a visit to California. But Smith was so shy, that he said, no I can't possibly go there and meet this great titan of literature, so he missed the chance of meeting the great Ambrose Bierce, and Sterling wanted him to go meet Jack London, who was one of his best friends, but again Smith just couldn't bring himself to do that. Despite his shyness, and feeling like a pariah in Auburn, Smith gained a reputation as a lady's man. He talked about being somewhat of a Don Juan in a small town. He may have played that up a bit, but some of it is true. There was one, I'll call her a girl, because it was like probably his first love, Mamie Miller, and no one knows anything about her, but I suspect that he was very young, in his teens, maybe around the time of the Star-Treader, they were in love. And she came down with, and died, from tuberculosis. And it ruined him. When she was dying, or when she had died, he ran off up into the hills by himself, and stayed there for a day, or as long as he could, until he had to come back, hungry and starving, but it really affected him. In 1915, during a period of ill health, Smith would begin drawing in pencil and crayon, to relieve stress. He would soon be painting fantastic creatures and landscapes. His work in the visual arts would continue for the rest of his life. It grew on me, I think the more I grew to love Smith, I understood, oh, he's sort of a phobist, or a true modern primitive. He did the very best he could. Perhaps that is the realm of the art world, in which he might one day be properly embraced. He is a true outsider artist, completely untrained. One, informed by a unique vision, a private world and realm, 'weltenschau' world vision, and a world of inner fantasy. His work is barbaric and yet, what really puts him in that category is an absolute necessity to produce. He wasn't producing for the next show, or the art critics, or somebody waiting. When you're living in a log cabin in the middle of the woods, it's your muse or demon that impels you to create, it's just what you do. You make your homemade wine, you write these stories that are flowing through you. You know there were so many different avenues of his creativity. He was almost like over-creative. The poetry, the prose, the artwork, the painting, the sculptures. He did a lot in expressing himself. The artwork in general, if that's all there was, it wouldn't be that notable, but I think as just another facet of his creativity, it just makes him all the more interesting, because some of it is very interesting. He had a genuine talent, and nobody else was doing this stuff. His artwork is cool to me, because it's like outsider art. It looks to not be tethered to anything. It looks like just some weirdo making art that's trippy, and I don't know, it seems like beautiful archaic, primordial visions. You know what I mean? Like weird flower, this one that I have. It looks an alien, a horrible little creepy alien flower from one of his planets. You know what I mean? That would try to sting your foot, or something while you're on your way to go to the cave, to address the deity that you need to kill, or whatever. And it's also kind of cool, because a lot of people get good at something, and then they feel inhibited from trying something else. It sounds to me, I didn't know him personally or nothin' but, it sounds to me just like somebody whose whole life was dedicated to the exploring of the nature of creation. You know, that's it. There's just the love of a juiciness of a human or creature's face. It's the face. We have less entire scenes with creatures, we have landscapes, a number of full bodies, but for some reason, over and over, he could have drawn anything he wanted, but, the face, creature, head and shoulders, over and over, often very balanced, very geometrical. His greatest work as an artist came in the 1920's, with these otherworldly dream landscapes. His artwork is cool. I think it's cool as shit. I mean if you look at it, you have to give value to things in life, we all do so, if I try to show this drawing to somebody, they'd be like, who drew that? Like a 13 year old, with some crayons? I'd be like, no, this genius did it. Smith chose to self-publish his next and best book of poetry, Ebony and Crystal. In its introduction, George Sterling declares it to be the birth of Smith as an immortal poet. Smith's brand of cosmic decadence had matured into a more exotic, yet Earthly, product, under the influence of French poet, Charles Baudelaire. People may wonder about the real life exoticism in Ebony and Crystal, and which is reflected as well in his prose, but in a different way. Where does that come from? It comes from his father, who at an early, he was a young man, come into an inheritance and just went around the world, pissing it off. I like that term, that's the exact correct term. There's references to flamingos, palms, in Ebony and Crystal. That reflects his father, who of course regaled his son with these stories of his early life, and where he had been, and it's a shame that Smith never had the money to travel. But in one way his stories are more vivid than the recollections of people who have been to all these places. Smith's longest and most audacious poem, the Hashish Eater, or the Apocalypse of Evil, would serve as Ebony and Crystal's centerpiece. The Hashish Eater, from the very first time I saw it, I read it. It commands your attention, with that, bow down, I am the emperor of dreams. That's like a really commanding voice. And it never lets up. His longest and most ambitious poem, The Hashish Eater, is in pentameter blank verse, and opens up chaotic and incredible vistas of kaleidoscopic nightmare in the spaces between the stars. In sheer demonic strangeness, and fertility of conception, Smith is perhaps unexcelled by any other writer living or dead. Smith, the way he uses words, above all in The Hashish Eater, which is not typical, that took him over, while he was doing it. Generally, he was a very self-aware creator with words, but sometimes it seems to be he's pushing them almost beyond what they can carry, although he's using them in a correct way. Bow down, I am the emperor of dreams. I crown me with the million-colored sun of secret worlds, incredible, and take their trailing skies for vestment, when I soar, throned on the mounting zenith, and illume the spaceward-flown horizons, infinite, like rampant monsters, roaring for their glut, the fiery crested oceans rise and rise, by jealous moons, maleficently urged to follow me forever. There's crystalline, cube-forming turrets and weird castles that are inside out. It's like M.C. Escher shit, you know, and then like the bizarre alien flora and fauna of some vast area and like the people there. It's like some Jim Henson shit on crack. It's definitely an important piece. It is not one which I would recommend for the novice Smith reader. It's like if you were just getting to, if you were just starting to get into the music of Richard Wagner, you'd want to start with Die Walkure or Die Meistersinger or possibly Lohengrin or Tannhauser. You're not gonna start with Tristan and Isolde, or Parsifal. At over 600 lines of dense blank verse, Hashish Eater is Smith's nightmarish, psychedelic opus, in which he crowns himself the Emperor of Dreams. HP Lovecraft would call the poem, the greatest imaginative orgy in literature. Smith also fully illustrated his poem with at least 23 paintings, making it a visionary hybrid, in the tradition of William Blake. Unfortunately, the poem and the paintings have never been published in tandem. Surveyed, from this my throne, as from a central sun, the pageantries of worlds and cycles pass, forgotten splendors, dream by dream unfold, like tapestry, and vanish. Violet suns, or suns of changeful iridescence, bring their rays about me, like the colored lights imploring priests might lift to glorify the face of some averted god. Smith filled every rift of his condensed epic poem with sparkling and grotesque ore, providing the reader with vision upon vision. The theme of the drug experience allowed Smith to free his hero from the chains of time and space, where the poem ultimately culminates in dark revelation of cosmic consciousness. In terms of pure escapist fantasy, high fantasy, weird cosmic fantasy, certainly The Hashish Eater is virtually unparalleled. It's just this, I almost envision The Hashish Eater, the poem itself is like this monument, like I imagine it like this almost like obelisk of words, like towering over everything, admitting every color just like fantasy. And bloats against the limits of the world, with lips of flame that open. In many cases, just because a man wrote about drugs fantastically, doesn't mean that he took drugs. We'd like to believe that beyond being an alcoholic, Poe, was deeply addicted to opium, and lived the life of his characters, possibly not so. People would love to get proof that Clark Ashton Smith smoked a little bit, or consumed something beyond fantastical homemade wine, that gave him these visions. I don't know if we'll ever be able to prove this, although, off the record, didn't you hear something about some doormen or some kids who supplied him with the ganja, did you hear anything about that one? You look at like Lord Dunsany's work, and it's all fantastical and amazing, but you look at the stories in The Hashish Eater, and they have such an extraordinarily strange quality, kind of like Max Fleischer's cartoons, with this serpent eating its own tail, and this weird sort of seamlessness that just, somebody's smoking opium in there. One thing I should emphasize is that, Smith was using hashish as a metaphorical term. There is no evidence to suggest that he ever had consumed hashish. George Sterling had some hashish at one time, but he discouraged Smith from using it. And it was myself and John Shirley, who know whereof we speak, whereas in the relation between the pharmaceutical and the literary arts, we both said, I can hear it, and I can smell it in there, the way that, you know, the way that a junkie knows his own kind. I can't help but feel that like Lovecraft, Lovecraft, was a teetotaler, and yet has anybody written trippier visions? The guy must have been on drugs, man. With somebody like Smith, I can't help but think of another surrealist, Dali, who said, I don't do drugs, I am drugs, right? I don't do acid, I am the vehicle. He was already tapped into those worlds at birth. He didn't need artificial stimulation to get there. Ebony and Crystal sold poorly. To repay printing and binding costs to the Auburn Journal, Smith started writing a weekly column for the local paper. From 1923 to 1925, the Clark Ashton Smith column featured lyric poems, and Biercian epigrams. He would later say, the column was too sophisticated for its audience, and that he was lucky he wasn't thrown in the county jail, with the provocative and risque form of satire he employed. After all, why resist temptation? If one's temptations are scarce, one cannot afford to slight them, and if they are plentiful, one is sure to succumb sooner or later anyhow. Surgeons always operate twice, once on the patient, and once on the patient's pocketbook. George Sterling Park. The plaque reads, George Sterling's romantic, lyrical poetry won him the unofficial title of poet laureate of San Francisco. Jack London was his close friend, and Ambrose Bierce, his mentor. Sterling's charisma and high spirits inspired fellow writers and artists to dub him quote, King of Bohemia, unquote. This other plaque is a stanza from his poem, The Cool Gray City of Love, which is of course San Francisco. George Sterling, 1869-1926. Though the dark be cold and blind, yet her sea fog's touch is kind, and her mightier caress is joy and the pain thereof. And great is thy tenderness oh cool gray city of love! I think Sterling felt that the subject matter of his poetry was hindering his own recognition in broader literary circles. Because again at this time, elements of the weird and the fantastic were regarded as not genuine literature. The modernists didn't like the weird, they wanted social realism of the sort that people like Sinclair Lewis was writing, and even poetry was meant to reflect present-day reality, as opposed to fantasy and horror, and so I think Sterling was worried that Smith would not receive the recognition that he deserved, if he kept solely devoted to the weird. But a real rift came in the mid-1920's when Smith started writing fiction. He wrote The Abominations of Yondo in 1925, and sent it to Sterling, expecting Sterling to like this work, because it was a very evocative piece of writing, but Sterling came down quite hard, saying oh the weird has played out, nobody's writing the weird any more. We just don't think this is a mature form of writing, and I think Smith was totally taken aback, and he shot back a very strong response to Sterling, saying, hey I'm sorry but the weird is as legitimate a form of writing as anything else, and I'm gonna stick to it. Smith vowed to go even further into the realm of the imagination than ever before, into Hyperborea beyond Hyperborea, as he phrased it. Unfortunately, this rift over the merits of the purely imaginative in literature, would occupy the bulk of their final correspondence, before Sterling's death by suicide, on November 16th, 1926. As George Sterling was steering Smith away from the weird, Smith's other great friend and literary correspondent, HP Lovecraft, was encouraging in that direction, inciting him to do so in prose. They began exchanging letters in 1922, before Lovecraft would write any of the tales in his celebrated Cthulhu mythos. It's really pretty remarkable how these two great writers came into contact. In 1922, Lovecraft really was not a recognized figure at all. He had only published in amateur venues, with the exception of two little stories that had been published in this horrible little professional magazine called Home Brew. But he had already started developing a network of friends and colleagues around the country, who were interested in the things that he was. In particular, he got in touch with George Kirk, who was a bookseller, first in Cleveland, and then later in New York. Now Kirk, I believe, had visited Smith in California and certainly knew Smith for a good many years. And so Kirk passed on one of Smith's early poetry books to Lovecraft. At the same time, Samuel Loveman, who had known Smith also since at least the teens, passed on another poetry book to Lovecraft. Loveman had gotten acquainted with Lovecraft in at least around 1917 or thereabouts. And Lovecraft was totally blown away. I mean it was exactly the kind of poetic writing that he himself wished he could write, but knew he couldn't. Smith was so much better a poet than Lovecraft, and Lovecraft recognized it. So he simply sat down and wrote what can only be considered a fan letter to Smith, saying, wow I read these two books of your poetry and I think they're fabulous, and please write back to me. He was being a fanboy. It's so funny. Lovecraft always sought out kindred spirits, and he found very few of them really. His focus was what he called cosmic horror, and he recognized that he wrote in a letter to Donald Wandrei, who was also a great friend of Smith's, that it was rarer than hen's teeth as he called it, that sense of the cosmic. He had it, Wandrei had it, Smith had it. Not a whole of other people in his circle had it, so I think he felt a particular bond to Smith. I mean he had great correspondences with people like August Derleth, and Robert E Howard, but these writers really didn't express the cosmic in the sense that he did. The two embarked on a collaboration of sorts after just four months of correspondence, when Smith illustrated Lovecraft's, The Lurking Fear, for Home Brew magazine. This is a facsimile printing from Necronomicon Press, of the Home Brew publication of Lovecraft's The Lurking Fear, illustrated by Clark Ashton Smith. One of Smith's talents is he catches movements and you can see the way he catches movement in his artwork. It's very simple artwork. But the really amusing thing, because Lovecraft is known to have been a bit of a prude, and I don't know if Lovecraft actually. I don't think Lovecraft was as much a prude as people say he was, and he may have been, because how can you miss, these trees resemble nude bodies. This tree has testicles. Maybe it's so obvious to us because we know what they are but, I want to imagine that Lovecraft, he wasn't maybe in on it, but he recognized it for what it was, and it probably amused him. That is a male tree I believe. That blossom is definitely a female. What were they thinking? Well, he was an ardent lover of women, of beauty and of drink, and wild times. That kind of frivolity, he was able to get inside it, the way that Lovecraft always felt outside. In his Dreamland stories, they're always about pretenders and people in this world who fail and die. But when they go off into that other place, it kind of becomes sort of evanescent, what those pleasures were, they're wonderful, but they're always in that city that's unattainable. Smith started out in that city. And that's kind of wonderful, I would much rather have been Smith than Lovecraft. The focus of both writers' work in prose fiction, initially at least, was Weird Tales magazine. In fact, Lovecraft claimed that he at the very outset of Weird Tales' founding in 1923, persuaded the editor to revoke what he called a 'no poetry' principle, and get Smith's poetry published in Weird Tales. Smith didn't start writing fiction extensively until about 1929, but by then you could tell that the relationship between Smith and Lovecraft had developed to the point where they were really exchanging a lot of ideas back and forth, and not just plot ideas, but really fundamental ideas, on what it is to write weird fiction, what is the nature of weird fiction. What is the best way to write weird fiction? The two writers were actually quite different in their approaches. Lovecraft called himself a prose realist, starting with the natural world, and building upon it. Whereas Smith said, I like to invent everything in a story. He was a pure fantasist of the sort that we found in the work of Lord Dunsany, for example, or later, in the work of JRR Tolkien. Smith really wasn't interested even in the real world, he said, I don't care enough about the real world to write about it. So he wanted to create imaginary worlds out of whole cloth, but given that difference, they still had a very similar outlook in the sense of the cosmic. Lovecraft, Smith, and the young writer, Robert E Howard, would become known as the three musketeers of Weird Tales, during the golden age of the magazine. Under the editorship of Farnsworth Wright, the unique magazine was a perfect place for Smith's Poe-esque tales. Three of these stories would receive color cover illustrations. And he was the rare talent who would illustrate his own stories for the magazine. Yeah it's funny, a lot of people think Smith is some sort of imitator of Lovecraft, which is flagrantly not the case, even in those few stories where Smith did adapt elements of Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos, there are only really three or four stories where he uses that mythos in a central or essential way. Otherwise it's just a matter of dropping terms. In fact, a lot of people aren't aware that Smith was the one who created the toad god Tsathoggua, assuming that's how you pronounce it, and that Lovecraft borrowed it from him, and then kind of ran off with it. In fact, later in the 1930's, when he saw that Lovecraft and others were borrowing some of his own inventions, he said, it seems that I have created a mythology. So in a sense, Smith had created his own parallel mythology, similar to the Cthulhu mythos. If you read the stories that Lovecraft wrote before he came into contact with Smith, and those that he wrote afterwards, you notice that there, that there was definitely an increase in cosmic, in a cosmic vision. And when Smith was inspired by Lovecraft to start writing more short fiction, we could see basically that the two began a positive feedback loop, where the two were basically, each one was seeing where the other one was going, and would kind of leapfrog to the next position. I think Lovecraft was seriously influenced by Clark Ashton Smith, that he opened doors for Lovecraft, that Lovecraft had only peered through. Clark Ashton Smith opened those portals wide and Lovecraft walked through, and became the icon he is today. Lovecraft himself, maybe is not as well known as a poet, but he considered himself overall a poet, although most of his earlier stuff was kind of imitation 18th century verse, which is a little dry, not actually terribly interesting, not very weird, or fantastical like his stories were. And I think it was his correspondence with Smith that kind of opened up Lovecraft's eyes to the possibility that poetry could be an expression of fantastic vistas, much in the same way that his stories were, and he wrote some really amazing weird poems, like the Fungi from Yuggoth, and The Ancient Tract, and I don't know if he would have gotten there without Smith. So I mean they're kind of inseparable in a way to me, Lovecraft and Smith. I mean you can't have one without the other. As a stylist, and as a writing personality, Clark Ashton Smith very soon became that jewel. Lovecraft, the substance of his ideas are so fantastic that as you grow, you kind of outgrow his prose, or his lack of interest in human being, human motivations, but somehow Smith's poetical nature, and his very canny sanguine understanding about human nature, it's really easier to love and feel a love in it, that is kind of missing in Lovecraft, and is really kind of frightening in Howard. Determined to make a career writing for the pulps, in order to support his aging parents, Smith began writing science fiction and fantasy tales. He had great success with Hugo Gernsback's Wonder Stories, and although the genre was not perfectly suited to his sensibilities, because of its insistence on formulaic plots, and heavy doses of action, he distinguished himself from other writers by his staggering imagination, and his instantly recognizable writing style. The voice of a master is the one he takes at spearpoint, for his own. All others stand aside, and he allows no one else to write like him. And they try and try and try and try and try, and it's wonderful to watch people trying to reach that summit, and they shan't, because that summit is beyond reach. It is above Hyperborea, beyond Zothique. And that's where Clark Ashton Smith was. He was in the outer reaches. It's so out there, everything about the way he uses language is designed to create the effect that we strive for in weird literature, the other, the fantastic, the beyond. He preferred to create a type of verbal black magic in his stories, in which he used alliterations, simile, metaphor, and a number of other poetic devices to create a type of spell. For a brief period, the dead had lived again. Fallen leaves had returned to the bough, the heavenly bodies had stood at the long-abandoned station. The flower had gone back into the seed, the plant into the root. Then, with eternal disorder set among all its cycles, time had resumed its delayed course. I learned how to read aloud, from reading Clark Ashton Smith. I would sit and read him aloud to myself. And reading him aloud, taught me how put accent, how to put emphasis, how to put meaning and order. I know a lot of people that were, they didn't like Lovecraft because of his monster stories, but the people never win, there's no action, there's not even any dialog, and they were frustrated with it. And people that were frustrated with Smith, because it's not sword and sorcery, it's not Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, and Conan, it's the anti of that. The slinky evil wizard that is the antagonist in a Howard story, is gonna be the protagonist in a Smith story, and rightfully so. It's almost like revenge against the banality of reality, by expanding in this way, where they're like, no dude, I'm going out here. You guys are down here, and that's, I love you, but you're gonna have to stay here in a shitheap. I'm going out here, and there's wizards and dimensions and places and reflections, of impossibility. What else can you do with your brain except for use it? How would the universe's ultimate power reveal itself? I'd like to think it would look cool. Much of Smith's reputation as a pioneer of the fantasy genre rests on his four main story cycles, set on created worlds. The Averoigne Chronicles fuse weirdness and eroticism, and are set in medieval France. The dark, misty forest of this region teems with every conceivable form of superstition, and creature of mythology, witches, wizards, giants, vampires, werewolves, and killer gargoyles, animate this realm with a dark romanticism. Smith borrowed the setting, Hyperborea, from the Greeks. To him, this fabled region of the far north is doomed by the coming of an ice age. From this cycle we get the famous god, Tsathoggua, and two of his most memorable characters, in Ivan the Sorcerer, author of the black book, and the one-armed wine-swilling thief, Satampra Zeiros. The Atlantean Tales take place on Poseidonis, the last isle of the foundering mythical empire. They prominently feature Malygris, a powerful wizard, housed in a tower, coming to grips with his own mortality, as he surveys the destructive tide. His most popular story cycle is also his darkest. Zothique is set on Earth with a far-future epoch. The opening paragraph of The Dark Eidolon features some of his best writing. On Zothique, the last continent of Earth, the sun no longer shone with the whiteness of its prime, but was dim and tarnished as if with a vapor of blood. New stars without number had declared themselves in the heavens, and the shadows of the infinite had fallen closer, and out of the shadows, the older gods had returned to man, the gods forgotten since Hyperborea, since Mu and Poseidonis, bearing other names, but the same attributes. And the elder demons had also returned, battening on the fumes of evil sacrifice, and fostering again the primordial sorceries. The zenith of Smith's short career as a fiction writer, is the breathtaking fantasy, The City of the Singing Flame. This profound tale is perhaps his greatest statement for the imagination, and gets to the very source of what propels artists towards mystery and inspiration, and the darkness and danger that lies therein. It's perhaps his most influential tale as well, inspiring the likes of Ray Bradbury and Harlan Ellison. Mister Ellison claims to have read it over 200 times. Well I first came across Clark Ashton Smith in this book. I was in high school, at Cleveland Heights High. That would have been 1950, I guess, 50, 51. And the story of course was The City of the Singing Flame. Opening this book, this August Derleth book, The Other Side of the Moon, with a Virgil Finley cover on it, was as if I had opened Pandora's Box. The limitations of the English language suddenly were blown out at me, like a giant blossom opening. The man used words in a way that I found utterly captivating. Fantasy rides on gossamer wings, and it defies its own reality. And if you have to involve a flying blue monkey, or you have to throw in a dragon, you do it, it's just, wishy washy. Clark Ashton Smith was anchored to the Earth, and when you read The City of the Singing Flame, it's as if you were walking with Clark Ashton Smith. You know the whole city inside the, you know it's like, it's just incredible. You go through the portals, and then you find the road, and then you find the city, and then all these alien pilgrims are heading there, and you can hear that music, that kind of a siren call, and then you find the temple in the middle of the city. It's just like all these distancing kind of techniques, and so by the time you, and then you enter the flame and go somewhere else. It's like wow. Reading the City of the Singing Flame was like nothing else I have ever read. It's a story that is almost like a drug experience, because if you react strongly to it, you never have that same experience again. The story is set in a real location in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, Crater Ridge, near Donner Summit, now home to Boreal Ski Resort. I ventured there for the first time in spring 2015 with my expert guides, Ron Hilger, and Donald Sidney-Fryer. Crater Ridge is still a wild, eerie place, subject to extreme winds. The landscape and surrounding mountains are rugged, and inspiring. As we got closer and closer to the top of the mountain, I was slowly drawn in to the world Smith created, and I kept thinking about what Harlan had said. When you read the City of the Singing Flame, it's as if you are walking with Clark Ashton Smith. Crater Ridge is like an epicenter to Smith's world, not just the setting to his most famous tale, it was here that his girlfriend Genevieve Sully convinced him to attempt to make a living as a pulp writer. And it was here that he found those strange rocks that he sent to friend, HP Lovecraft. And it may have inspired his later sculptures. This is just an example of the erosions, and the etchings, you know, it's weathered and then crumbles off and falls down the slope. We'll find some better examples, but these are the kind that Lovecraft described as hieroglyphic writings from some pre-human civilization. Many devotees of Smith's writings have made the hike to the top of Crater Ridge. Now past the ski lifts, time seems to stand still. One can still see the sparse vegetation he describes in the story. The strange volcanic rocks, and the unfathomed lake, or tarn, at the top of the mountain that he so magnificently recounts. I think the City of the Singing Flame is one of Smith's greatest pieces. It is almost the perfect example of the weird story that Lovecraft described in Notes on the Writing of Weird Fiction, and that it is the description of, the hero is a mood or phenomenon, not so much any particular character. It's also one which deals with one of Smith's major themes, one which he got from the decadence in Theophile Gautier. Basically it's a death wish, a drive towards Thanatos, a mixture between Thanatos and Eros. Eros and Thanatos, Smith's two great themes, present in nearly every story he wrote. This tale is a dark meditation, with intimations of suicide as the characters seem to willingly propel themselves towards annihilation and the flame. But its sequel, Beyond the Singing Flame, is the payoff. The lure of the flame won't kill you, but transport you to a higher plane of consciousness, to an exalted state. When the city is attacked, and evidently destroyed, because the neighboring countries, dismayed by all the people disappearing into this other dimension, and then of course when he finds himself, he's still alive, his friend has died, it is a shattering experience don't you think? And the complete feeling of desolation, wow. Yeah, it really is like, it's something analogous to a drug experience, where people have a very intense, other-worldly experience, and then after that, you come down, and you will be down in a way you never imagined before. I even shoplifted the original book that I read that story in, from the Heights High library, in Cleveland. Now, as I write this, I am wondering why I came back to the human world. Words are futile to express what I have beheld and experienced. Literature is nothing more than a shadow of a shadow. I have no longer any will to fight the ever-insistent music I hear in memory. Tomorrow, I shall return to the city. One can easily read the characters of Angarth and Hastane, as stand-ins for Lovecraft and Smith. Self-immolating themselves into the very source of mystery and wonder. Lovecraft very much wanted to visit Smith and see Crater Ridge for himself, but he died in 1937, before such a meeting could occur. It is incredible and so fortunate to us all, that they became such good friends. It kills me that they never met. I love to imagine that meeting. I know their hopes and dreams in a number of the letters, perhaps one day next year I might be able to arrange... But that meeting was not to occur, and yet it did occur, and they were closer friends of the same mind, than most people who get to hang out all the time. It's so fortunate they were there to inspire one another. And I know you're particularly fond of his elegy to Lovecraft. Yeah, I mean, his poem that he wrote upon Lovecraft's death, I think he wrote only a few days, or at least a few weeks afterwards, one of the most touching poems I have ever read. Especially if you know Lovecraft's work, he has all these poignant references to Ulthar and Cthulhu, but even beyond that, you can tell that he was a man who was deeply moved by the death of a colleague and friend, whom he had never met, over the 15 years of their correspondence, and yet, they had established such a bond, just through their own writings and their own letters, and in some ways Smith never recovered from the death of Lovecraft, as with the death of his own parents. And I think that had a lot to do with his giving up writing, basically, at least giving up prose writing. To Howard Phillips Lovecraft. Lover of hills and fields and towns antique, how hast thou wandered hence on ways not found before beyond the dawnward spires of Providence? Hast thou gone forth to seek some older bourn than these, some Arkham of the prime and central wizardries? Or, with familiar felidae, dost now some new and secret wood explore, a little past the senses' farther wall, where spring and sunset charm the eternal path from Earth to ether in dimensions nemoral? Or has the Silver Key opened perchance for thee wonders and dreams and worlds ulterior? Hast thou gone home to Ulthar or to Pnath? Has the high king who reigns in dim Kadath called back his courtly, sage ambassador? Or darkling Cthulhu sent the sign which makes thee now a councilor within that foundered fortress of the deep where the Old Ones stir in sleep till mighty temblors shake their slumbering continent? Lo, in this little interim of days how far thy feet are sped upon the fabulous and mooted ways where walk the mythic dead! For us the grief, for us the mystery. And yet thou art not gone nor given wholly unto dream and dust. For, even upon this lonely western hill of Averoigne thy flesh had never visited, I meet some wise and sentient wraith of thee, some undeparting presence, gracious and august. More luminous for thee the vernal grass, more magically dark the Druid stone, and in the mind thou art forever shown as in a magic glass; and from the spirit's page thy runes can never pass. Smith was always a collector of local rocks and minerals. In 1935 on a whim, he began carving some of the softer ones into grotesque and demonic characters. Thus began a new phase of his creative life. These small sculptures gave him great joy. And when his mother experienced her final illness and death, he credited his new interest with saving his life, and drawing him out of a deep depression. I know that his first couple of pieces, he was like, chopping them out of granite, or not granite, but like very hard rock, and then his uncle, Ed Gaylord, had that mine down in Lincoln, the Collaga Mine, and that's where he found this talc material, which is a very chalky, easy to work, and so then that probably just kind of freed him up. He could just carve it, and away he went. What excites me about Smith's carvings, is that we see no struggle, or even experimentation. Although his work has that raw, primitive barbaric roughly hewn quality, you could see that from the very beginning he had no problem achieving, which most artists or people who try to set pen to paper, struggle with immediately, which is to transfer what they see to paper. Over and over, people might copy something, but Smith he saw the thing and he just messed with it and work it until he got it how he wanted it to be. So you know that this is directly from his subconscious. I think that a lot of his sculptures look like him by the way. Really? Go back and look at quite a number of those strange faces. It's impossible, being an artist, to not produce self portraits, even if all you do is monsters. Tell me many tales oh benign maleficent demon, but tell me none that I've ever heard, or have even dreamt of otherwise than obscurely or infrequently. Nay, tell me not of anything that lies between the bourns of time or the limits of space, for I am a little weary of all recorded years and charted lands; and the isles that are westward of Cathay, and the sunset realms of Ind, are not remote enough to be made the abiding-place of my conceptions; and Atlantis is over-new for my thoughts to sojourn there, and Mu itself has gazed upon the sun in aeons that are too recent, tell me many tales, but let them be of things that are past the lore of legend and of which there are no myths in our world or any world adjoining. Tell me, if you will, of the years when the moon was young, with siren-rippled seas and mountains that were zoned with flowers from base to summit; tell me of the planets gray with eld, of the worlds whereon no mortal astronomer has ever looked, and whose mystic heavens and horizons have given pause to visionaries. Tell me of the vaster blossoms within whose cradling chalices a woman could sleep; of the seas of fire that beat on strands of ever-during ice; of perfumes that can give eternal slumber in a breath; of eyeless titans that dwell in Uranus, and beings that wander in the green light of the twin suns of azure and orange. Tell me tales of inconceivable fear and unimaginable love, in orbs whereto our sun is a nameless star, or unto which its rays have never reached. He evidently found a dinosaur skeleton, along the railroad tracks where they had cut in, and he said that some of them were cut out of what he called dinosaur steak, and apparently it worked out pretty well. This one almost looks reddish, who knows what exactly it was? This is a neat thing I got from Marjorie Hill, who is Marilyn Novak's daughter, and as you can see it's a pipe bowl. And it's just very intricate, and never had a stem on it, but can you imagine how long it took to hollow that out? I mean it's a fairly soft material, but this is probably my favorite piece. The year he began is sculptures would also mark the year his short, but prolific, and successful career as a fiction writer would end. He would only write prose sporadically, thereafter. Lovecraft was his first and most appreciative reader. When Lovecraft passed away, and his parents passed away, Smith developed what he called the disgust mechanism, and found it very, very difficult for him to write any more stories, and then when Weird Tales was sold, and the new publisher returned his story, The Coming of the White Worm, as being too disgusting, Smith gave E. Hoffman Price a couple of manuscripts, told him to rewrite them, or throw them out. He didn't care what he did with them, but he basically rid his hands of fiction writing. Out of frustration Smith would self-publish another book in 1933. It was entirely comprised of tales Smith could not sell to the pulps, regardless of their high literary quality. With the founding of Arkham House in 1939, Smith would never again have to self-publish his work. His poetry and prose would be housed in the high quality, hard-bound format, they so deserved. The inspiration for Arkham House, came when Lovecraft died, suddenly and unexpectedly. Very few people knew that he was so ill, but he died at an early age in 1937, and August Derleth, who had been a correspondent of his, since 1926, said we gotta do something here, we gotta save Lovecraft's work from the oblivion of the pulp magazines. So he and Wandrei got together and founded Arkham House in 1939. But almost immediately thereafter, Derleth said well, we should publish other work by the Lovecraft circle, or by the Weird Tales circle, and so his second book was one of his own stories collections, and then the third book was Smith's, Out of Space and Time. At this point, Smith was really not doing so well. As I say, since the death of Lovecraft, and the death of his own parents, in the mid-1930's, I think Smith was sort of at sea, he didn't really know how he wanted to proceed. I think he actually spent a lot of time, I'm sorry to say, drinking, and I think the inspiration to write prose fiction certainly had fallen by the wayside. Smith was very happy to have his stories published in collection after collection, but he was dismayed, as Derleth was, that these books were not welcomed by the literary public in general. The New York Times Book Review wrote some rather pungent, unfavorable notices of the Smith books, and that I think discouraged Smith. Of great wonderment to me also, is the shortness of his writing career. It haunts my greatly. It troubles me. Why did he stop? What would we have, had he continued? Sometimes I want to scold Smith. He was a popular Arkham House writer, and he didn't take advantage of that. Yeah, I was imagining a conversation with Clark Ashton Smith where, after looking at photos of what Auburn used to look like, and seeing photos of the people, whatever, borderline gold miners, yes, like leather things on everywhere, just being like, oh hey young man what's your? Oh you're a writer? Oh that's cool. You got a nice little talent there, that's great, what do you write about? And then they read the writing, you know what I mean? They read it, and like, oh you've been published? Oh that's cool, you're bringing some glory to our little town. And then they read what they write, and it's like, what the hell is wrong with you man? You're weird, dude. And so, I imagined that happening to him, in some capacity because that's exactly what happened to me. Because people be like, oh you do art? Oh that's great. And show 'em this horrendous weird shit you draw, and then they're just like, trying to get their children not to hang out with you from that point. After the deaths of his parents in the mid-1930's, Smith was free in ways he'd never been before. He'd often expressed a desire to leave Auburn, which he called a hell bedunged, heaven bespitted place. He not only wanted to leave Auburn, but leave California and the USA. Instead, he settled in for nearly 20 more years. He clearly perceived himself as a rebel, and an outsider. In a letter to Robert Barlow, he would say, I could never live in any modern city. Even more of an outsider than HPL. His outsideness was principally in regard to time period, mine is of space, too. Well he did get to manifest the realization that people were moved in Japan, and were moved in France, and were moved in other places in the world, and even in the United States, where few would come to see him, but they did come, and Clark never left to meet HP but. Had Howard lived he would have come, and I think if HP had lived he would have come. I think they would have. They would have come to him. Many fans and fellow writers would come to him. His hilltop cabin became a somewhat mythical place, with no roads leading to its door, only footpaths. During this period, he began fancying himself as some sort of wizard, and there are many fanciful memoirs of journeys to meet the Dark Lord of Averoigne. In reality, Smith was a gracious host, courtly and courteous, and made lifelong friends with some of his fans. Such esteemed writers as Fritz Leiber, Henry Kuttner, Jack Williamson, and Edmond Hamilton, make the pilgrimage to meet the Bard of Auburn. And he would have the occasional visit from an enchantress. But such visits were infrequent, and the years long. The Gold Rush history of Auburn and the region never impressed Smith much, and in a postcard to HP Lovecraft, he fails to note the beauty of Auburn's famous courthouse, which is surprising, since its goddesses of wisdom and justice are surrounded by the gargoyles of the local law offices. He worked many odd jobs during this period to support himself. He was a woodcutter, a gardener, fruit picker, miner. He once joked that the local ragpicker at the city dump offered to take him on as an assistant. He was Auburn's starving artist. He suffered through severe poverty. Friends would buy him meals, and send him typewriter ribbon when his letters would arrive too faint to read. Despite living out the tragedy of the neglected artist, there was also triumph. Through his uncompromising life in art, he was slowly building his legend, one that was not susceptible to fads and literary movements. His work, his volumes and filters would abide. He did write the occasional story for a new generation of pulp readers, but mostly, he just sort of floated along, writing the occasional poem, working on his carvings. He was done chasing literary fame. Perhaps he was waiting for the world to come to him. I think it was part of him, too, because he was born into this wonderful place, and it is beautiful. Auburn was, before people came, those blue oaks were, very much blue, and everywhere. And I think that's part of it for him, was being in such an insular place. When I first went to Auburn, I was hoping to find a place that celebrated Smith, at least to the extent that Providence celebrates Lovecraft. A few more plaques, a sense of his presence, local history. I certainly feel that Auburn should be a center for pilgrims of weird fiction. Just like Baltimore, people go there because Poe was there. Providence, Lovecraft. Auburn, Smith. And this rock on which I'm sitting is a favorite rock, it comes from Smith's property, it was a favorite rock where he would like to sit down and and just sort of hang out. And it's a nice public monument in Centennial Park. So that anybody coming from a distance and wants to see something associated with him, this is it. There's also this newer tribute on the sidewalk in downtown Auburn, but even with these plaques and markers, Smith remains mostly unknown to the average Auburnite. Pretty much ubiquitous that throughout that people don't know who we're talking about. The native son is not the native son. The memories of the old that live here, they've all passed on, so he's not really known as a native son unfortunately. He is to the larger world outside of us, but not here, which is really abysmal considering what a remarkable person he was, and writer. This is Poet Smith Drive, but the footpath was always his preferred route. I think he felt like he would have been much happier if he had been born during the renaissance or in medieval times, when he could have been a troubadour or something, and become famous for his lyrics and his poetry, and he just was not appreciated. He escaped, from Auburn, in more ways than one. As much as he loved the place, the physical place, and much as he loved some of the people, I think it was a very daunting experience for a kid like him to grow up there. And yet the thing we yearned for, the thing that we returned for, from tomb and catacomb, it may not wholly dwindle while moon or meteor kindle, a phantom beacon on the ebon foam. Through ghoul-watched wood unthridden, by goblin mere and middin, no ivory horn will blow, no gold lamp lighten gloom-ward, but we will carry doom-ward the broken beauty caught from long ago. In 1954, the solitary sorcerer finally departed from the foothills, and fulfilled a dream of his, to live near the sea. After knowing each other for just a matter of weeks, Clark Ashton Smith and Carol Jones Dorman would be married at the office of the Justice of the Peace in Auburn. They would remain a devoted couple for the rest of his life. That was 1954, November, and I was just returning from a high school football game in Carmel, when Eric Barker, a poet, who introduced Smith and my mother, drove up in what my mother used to call a black moriah. It was a saloon car of some vintage, and drove up in the front of the house just as I arrived, and out popped Eric, who was sort of a gnomish little guy, and proudly opened the door, and out stepped my mother and this guy. And of course it was Smith. I was 13, my sister was 15, and my brother was 12. Here is a 61 year old guy, coming into a family. My mother was in her 40's, 46 I think, was coming into this household, with these three kids, and anybody that knows anything about Smith's background knows that that must have been an interplanetary experience on its own, and I'm sure it was. Smith now lived in a house with electricity and running water for the first time, with neighbors no less. He would still get up to the cabin for weeks at a time, and thought of it as a sort of rustic vacation from city life. But to his great sadness, his longtime home was vandalized, and finally burnt to the ground in December, 1957. Arson was suspected, and Smith refused to sell the remaining land in defiance to developers. Now, the final empty lot in the vicinity of the cabin is being built upon. And the boulder ridge that Clark Ashton Smith knew, no longer exists. You had asked if I was aware of his reputation as a poet. I wasn't that much until much later. What I was aware of, was that his writing had brought him some kind of fame, because, my brother and sister both moved out of the house while I was still in high school. My sister across the street to become a nanny, and my brother moved into an apartment with friends when he was a sophomore in high school. I was the only one that remained in the house, until I graduated from high school. And the door, somebody would knock on the door, and it'd be a visitor from Japan, in broken English saying, could he see Clark Ashton Smith. That's the way I met Donald Fryer. Clark Ashton Smith lived here at 11715th Street, from late 1954 until his death in August, 1961. I visited him here twice, the late summer of 1958, and the late summer of 1959. We had a picnic on the beach, on that part of the beach that was closest to the house. And since, and I had been wanting to spend some time with Smith, but we had not thought about reservations in motels. There was no place to be found. We did not know this was very much (muffled) area, and so they let me stay with them several days. Smith had all these like, what do you call? Plank bookcases. I would ask him a question, he would turn around and pick out a book. Yeah, I remember this. Oh wow, lookie. Yeah, I remember the backyard. And I remember the kitchen ceiling, which I don't know, it's probably not the same, but I cleaned it. And it was a mixture you know of oily gas. And I remember the bathroom. Yeah, and then that bedroom. But I've lived long enough to see this happen. You know what Yeats said, it isn't the artist's eye which justifies him, it's his public, if he can find one. And if he's a mere popular poet, well he'll find that, but if he's a great poet, he creates a new audience, and that's exactly what Smith is doing. I knew from being in the house and listening to Mom and Smith and the osmotic process, that poetry is what mattered to him, not the prose. And that according to my Mom, and from what I've read about it, he quit writing the prose in the 30's, after his parents died, or after he no longer had the responsibility for them, and concentrated on poetry and carving. The carving, he was doing constantly when we were in Pacific Grove. We discussed his poetry. There wasn't very many people with whom I could discuss it. They didn't know it. There were people who could discuss it, I didn't know them, so I asked him, which poet meant as much to him, as his poetry meant to me. So he turned around and pulled out that volume and started reading the beginning of Duandon, which really impressed me, because later on I got a copy and I read it for myself. As you know the language, it's like that of the ocean. In case I do not mention, he had a beautiful voice, deep. And he did not speak fast. He had a kind of a winsome quality that I liked. They were tender with each other, which is always a lovely thing to see between people, don't you think? Yeah, and also again I must give credit to Carol. Whether or not, you know, you get old. Your mentation isn't the same, you're not gonna keep producing masterpieces. He did do poetry, he continued writing poetry, but he was older, maybe he just didn't, don't begrudge an old man a period of rest. And so she provided him with a lovely home here, which otherwise he might not have had. Here we are in Pacific Grove in the 1950's, McCarthyism is still going on, and all of this stuff. My mother's writing letters to the Monterrey Peninsula Herald, protesting McCarthy, you know, I don't even know exactly what's going on, all I know is that this isn't mainstream, and here he is, wearing a beret, using a cigarette holder. I mean in Pacific Grove in the 1950's, I'm not even sure they knew what a cigarette holder was, and he was wearing, I'll always remember these, he wore cargo pants, World War II Army cargo pants. He loved them, because they had these huge pockets, and he could put his carving tools in them. He'd be wearing those, a beret, smoking a cigarette, Pall Malls, unfiltered, in a cigarette holder, and wearing one of those wonderful shirts that he used to have. Sometimes they looked sort of semi-Hawaiian or something. And blissfully sort of floating. The following poem, insofar as we know, was the last poem that Smith wrote. It's called Cycles. I actually commissioned the poem from Smith. It was gonna be used in the Smith bibliography. Unfortunately, for some reason or other it didn't make into the Black Book and other Publications. Cycles. The sorcerer departs, and his high tower is drowned slowly by low flat communal seas that level all, while crowding centuries retreat, return and fall into the cyclic gulf that girds the cosmos round, widening, deepening ever outward without bound, till the oft re-risen bells from young Atlantis call; and again the wizard-mortised tower upbuilds its wall above a re-beginning cycle, turret-crowned. Newborn, the mage re-summons stronger spells, and spirits with dazzling darkness clad about, and fierier flame renewed by aeon-curtained slumber. All the powers of genii and Solomon the sage inherits; and there, to blaze with blinding glory the bored hours, he calls upon Shem-hamphorash, the nameless Name. June 4th, 1961, Clark Ashton Smith. He died the 14th of August, 1961. Because of his illness, he had been ill previous to his death, bedridden, if you will, and Mom had moved a bed downstairs, or had it moved down, where the table, the writing table usually was. And you've been in the house, so it's in the main dining room part, and the table was removed, and the bed was substituted in, and Smith was lying there, on a bed, in a state. I don't know how else to describe it. She hadn't called anybody else, she just called me and she had given him a small posy of flowers, some flowers to put in his hand. And he looked extraordinarily peaceful. That's the first person, I suppose I remember this so clearly because it was the first person I had ever seen who was dead. And we sat there for I don't know how many hours. It was sort of a gentile version of sitting shiva. We sat there, I don't know how many hours, and not saying much at all. And then finally called a mortuary. Real talent always prevails. The real talent is always rediscovered, and Clark Ashton Smith was so god damn impressive, that anybody who has any aspirations, will come to him and find him, eventually. Smith is probably more popular now than he has ever been. There's always new editions coming out of his work, both in the US, and in foreign countries. It's constantly bubbling up, and at a lower level. When I first got into Lovecraft it was in the 80's, there was no internet. I had to go to the local university, and go into the special room to read books, and they wouldn't let you take them out and everything. It felt like you were at Miskatonic University reading forbidden tomes. Now, not only does the internet make it easy to access, it's utterly commonplace, everybody knows Cthulhu, and there's all these events and culture and merchandise and stuff like that. And so Smith still is this kind of conclave, sort of a cabal underneath. He knew of his own immortality. Clark Ashton Smith, all of his work speaks of his knowledge, his inherent deep down knowledge, his core certainty, that he would not turn to dust, that he would not be planted like a pumpkin, that eventually the world would come to him. Arkham House would publish 13 books by Smith through the years, including his selected letters, his writing journal, and the long-awaited Selected Poems, in 1971. The early 70's saw Smith published in paperback for the first time, thanks to editor Lin Carter. Ballentine's the Adult Fantasy Series was instrumental in bringing Smith out of the realm of the collector, into the common fantasy fan. New editions of his work continued to be brought forth throughout the 80's and 90's. And in the 21st century, our wizard's tower has been built anew, with the publication of his collected fantasies, and his complete poems and translations. And the inclusion of Clark Ashton Smith in the Penguin Classics Library in 2014 has finally cemented his name as a major figure of western literature. There have only been two attempts to translate Smith's visionary tales into film. The first was an episode of Rod Serling's Night Gallery, which transforms the story of the Return of the Sorcerer into what would have been Smith's worst nightmare, a hopelessly campy, made-for-TV occult melodrama. Perhaps Smith's unique blend of high literary quality with pulp narratives, is impossible to film faithfully. Harlan Ellison suggests that the problem lies with the Hollywood system. They are truly lyrical, in that they deal with other realms, realms beyond human awareness. And Hollywood movie-makers are neither equipped nor anxious to go into those areas. The other film, Mother of Toads, elevates the B movie format, and does Smith's tale justice under the direction of auteur, Richard Stanley. It's been very, very poorly served by cinema, similar to Lovecraft who I don't think has been treated terribly well by Hollywood either. But Smith in particular is almost impossible to translate to film. I would like to see more animations based on Smith's work, because possibly animation is the only way to approach some of the tales, considering their incredible, their sheer wildness. A story like say the Empire of the Necromancers might well work as an animation. But I would shudder to imagine how you could conceive of such a thing in real life. It's definitely time, I think for him to be considered not just as a serious fantasist, and should be elevated to that canon, right in there between L Frank Baum, Tolkien, and all of these other great and immortal creators, but also as a great American writer, as an American poet, and as an American prose stylist, and as a neo-primitivist artist. I think it's time. Here you are, 37, from Placerville, come to interview me in Los Angeles. I'm in the Clark Ashton Smith circle. You're now in the Clark Ashton Smith circle. Clark Ashton Smith has his own circle. There's no need for it to be larger, or smaller, it is as it is, and as it properly should be. Now everyone in the world is gonna respond to Clark Ashton Smith anymore than everybody in the world responds to Colette or Dumas. It is not necessary for everybody to be in the same place. You don't have to have everybody say, well how come he hasn't... Fuck you. You're asking the wrong question. You're asking a question that says everybody should be in the same god damn place, that unless you've got a twitter load of people posting your name, you aren't smart enough. Look at all the schmucks who have 10,000 hits on Facebook, who can't get a job. Anybody who says, how come he doesn't have more, say, you aren't asking the right question. He has all the aficionados he's supposed to have right now. And if he doesn't have them, they're coming. They're all coming. They're charging in slower, or faster. Time moves at its own pace. Clark Ashton Smith will never be forgotten. ♪ Ye that see in darkness ♪ ♪ When the moon is drowned ♪ ♪ In the coiling fen-mist ♪ ♪ Far along the ground ♪ ♪ Ye that see in darkness ♪ ♪ Say, what have ye found ♪ ♪ We have seen strange atoms ♪ ♪ Trysting on the air ♪ ♪ The dust of vanished lovers ♪ ♪ Long parted in despair ♪ ♪ And dust of flowers that withered ♪ ♪ In worlds of otherwhere ♪ ♪ We have seen the nightmares ♪ ♪ Winging down the sky ♪ ♪ Bat-like and silent ♪ ♪ To where the sleepers lie ♪ ♪ We have seen the bosoms ♪ ♪ Of the succubi ♪ ♪ We have seen the crystal ♪ ♪ Of dead Medusa's tears ♪ ♪ We have watched the undines ♪ ♪ That wane in stagnant weirs ♪ ♪ And mandrakes madly dancing ♪ ♪ By black, blood-swollen meres ♪ ♪ We have seen the satyrs ♪ ♪ Their ancient loves renew ♪
