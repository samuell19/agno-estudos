(Multicom Jingle) ("Where Did It Go" by Cory Lerios) - [Woman] C'mon, guys. (people cheering) - Down. Set, hut one! (man grunting) (people cheering) - You okay? Look, I told ya. This is crazy. (players chattering) - [Player] 'Kay, ready? - [All] Break! - Right. Let's go, guys. (players chattering) (bodies thudding) (Tom wincing) - How's the wrist? - (sighs) The wrist is a little sore, but it's fine. - Head okay? I mean you took a hit there. - I'm fine. Would you get off it? - I mean what the hell are you tryin' to prove back there? (people chattering) (retro rock music) (truck horn honking) - Thomas Murphy is on the pike. I'll get to Saginaw flash. I got off at pike, goin' down 46. Smooth sailin'. - [Driver] Smooth sailin', that right? - When the Flash ever steer you wrong? - [Driver] This here Tiger Paw, Flash. What kinda line you givin' us? There's speed trucks up and down the 46. - You watch your mouth, Tiger. - [Tiger] Say, who the hell are you? You're not on 46. - [Tom] Meet me, Tiger. I'll shove that microphone down your throat. Where you want it to be? - [Tiger] (chuckles) Hey Flash, is that you in that wimpy-dip little pizza truck behind me? - [Tom] We're tryin' to duck it, Tiger. Where do we meet? - [Tiger] Look, I'm not lookin' for trouble. - [Tom] Well I found you. Now you get off the air and ya stay off the air. If I hear your handle again, I'm gonna come lookin'. Lemme hear you sign-off. - [Tiger] Tiger out. - All right, the rest of you suckers hear that? Keep on truckin'. (bowling pins clanking) Yeah! All right. What'd I say, huh? What did I tell you? I can smell victory, baby. Just line 'em up for you. Go on. Go get 'em, baby. Ah needs a strike, he gets a strike. He comes through under pressure every time. You guys are done. - It was nice, Tom. It was very nice. - Nice? Nice, is that what you said? It was nice? Did you hear that? That was nice. (chuckles) - It was wonderful, Tom. It was fantastic. Too bad the 11 o'clock news wasn't here. (bowling pins clanking) (people chattering) - Do you think that's funny? Huh? You think that's funny? - You're right, Tom. - Hey, whatever you wanna think is funny, go ahead. Think it's funny. I came through, you come through. You knock 'em all down. It'll be nice for everybody. - Come on, Tom. Take it easy. - Hey, was I talkin' to you? Was anybody talkin' to you? You just stay the hell out. - Tom, I'm sorry. - Well sorry don't feed the bulldog, does it baby? I'm outta here. - Tom, come on. - Hey Tom, what's the matter? - You wanna get outta my face now? - All right, all right. (people chattering) - Nice. - You got change for the machine? - Yeah. - Cashin' out. - [Cashier] Just a moment please. - I just wrapped up a game with a strike. - Here you go. - Oh, that's great. - Damn right. That's what you're supposed to say, right Bobbi? - (chuckles softly) Yeah, I guess. - [Cashier] That'll be $8.00, sir. (cash register dinging) (bowling pins clanking) (Tom grunting) (crickets chirping) (people chattering) - Are you comin' or are they gonna give you a ride? - Looking for my cigarettes. I keep forgetting I gave them up. (soft intriguing music) I'm sorry, Tom. Really. It's so hot and I had a hard day. I guess I just wasn't up for it. - Well don't worry about it. I just get crazy sometimes. Yeah, I do and I treat you bad. I don't know what it is. (sighs) I get it in my head, you know? Like I'm in the seventh game of the series and you're out there cheering for me. And that's all that matters is you're out there cheering for me, only I ain't in the series and I'm never gonna be. (buzzer buzzing) (machines whooshing) - [Announcer] The cleaning schedule is on the memo board near the timeclock, thank you. Noreen Greer, please report to personnel office before you leave. Noreen Greer to the personnel office. (whistle hooting) (employees chattering) (timeclock clicking) (people chattering) - [Man] Yeah, he got a beef. - We were fishin' from Pike last week. We got a pretty good mess. - Yeah. - [Kramer] I could bring some over. - [Man] See ya tomorrow, Kramer. - Hey Bobbi, last night, bowling alley? - Oh yeah, you were the guy with the strike. - Yeah. Well I just figured you know, we're gonna keep running into each other like this that maybe we oughta talk. - About what? - Fate, I guess. I mean it has to mean something, doesn't it? Like maybe we're supposed to get together. What do you think we oughta do? - Do? - Yeah. You wanna go somewhere? - Hey come on, mister. - No no, Tom, Tom. You know, I thought maybe ice cream. Wanna go get an ice cream? - I'm sorry. I gotta get home. - No look, I know exactly what you're thinkin'. I don't wanna go anywhere with this guy. Nothin' personal, I understand. This day in age, girls have to take care of themselves, right? Right? On the other hand, he is kind of interesting funny sort of a way. I need to (speaks faintly). Ice cream doesn't sound bad. And if this line of reasoning is correct, you are dealing with exactly the right guy. - (chuckles) You keep ice cream in there? - Well Bobbi, a man never knows when he's about to start an important relationship. Got to be ready. It's okay. It's okay, Bobbi. (soft retro music) Looks better like that. Go on. - [Commentator] Here's the windup and the pitch. Ball two. - [Commentator] Yeah, Greg. The pass doesn't seem to be in his typical control tonight. - Tom? - [Tom] Yeah. - Some lobster salad left over. I brought it home. I thought it might be nice in this heat. - Yeah, sure. - I picked up some beer. - [Commentator] Here in the ninth. Just takin' his time. Here's the pitch, strike one. - I thought about you all day. - Yeah, it wasn't that bad. - I don't know how you do it. You know what might be nice? Why don't we go to the movies tonight? Something air conditioned, anything air conditioned. - Yeah, yeah. - I couldn't stop thinking about what you said last night about pitching in the World Series. - Yeah. Okay, I said it. It was stupid. Can we just forget about it? - No, I don't wanna forget it, Tom. (Tom sighing) I like when you talk to me about what you're thinking and when you confide in me. - Yeah, whatever. - And the pitch. There's a smash up the middle. (speech drowned by crowd cheering) They got him! - [Commentator] Whoa, what a play by second baseman. - Sit down. It'll be ready in a minute. - Two-run lead and they can't even hold onto it. Well I'm not really hungry, so I'm just gonna go. I love you, Nan. I don't know what it is. (soft somber music) Look. - See you tomorrow. (people chattering) (soft retro music) - [Bobbi] Hi. (truck engine rumbling) - So is this where you live? - No, the green one. I'll walk from here. - You married or somethin'? (Bobbi chuckling softly) 'Cause usually you know, a guy drives girl right up to her house. (birds chirping) Lemme guess: You live with somebody. - My parents. - Oh. No, I thought maybe there was a guy. - Are you makin' fun of me? - Makin' fun of you? No, I'm makin' fun of the guys in this town. What the hell's the matter with 'em? - I was never you know, popular. - You're kidding. Beautiful girl like you? - I'm not beautiful. - Well you oughta take a look at yourself sometime the way I do. (soft piano music) What's the matter? - No one's ever said anything to me like that before. Never. - I thought maybe I could pick you up like this after work again sometime. We'll go out for an ice cream. Maybe do a movie some night or some weekend, go to the beach. I'm no kid, but the way kids do, you know? I bet you look great in a bathing suit. (Bobbi chuckling softly) Got you somethin' else too. But that's where I ask you to marry me at the beach. Not the first time of course, but sometime before this heat breaks. Listen to me, I'm crazy. (Bobbi chuckling softly) It is somethin' to think about though. I mean you don't have to answer or anything right now, just think about it. I can't think about anything else. (soft romantic music) (birds chirping) (dog barking) Well you better go. You don't want your parents drivin' you crazy about who brought you home. - How'd you know that? - I know you, Bobbi. I hardly even met you, but I know you. You ever feel like that? (soft romantic music) (clock ticking) - Bobbi was late today. - What? - Bobbi was late coming home from work today. - 10 minutes. - 10 minutes. You know, Bobbi. I thought that something must've happened. - Why does anything have to happen? - Every day she comes home at the same time. You can set your watch by it. - Well then don't. - Are you seeing someone, Bobbi? - For Pete's sake. - What? What did I say wrong now? There's nothing wrong with her seeing someone. - Hell no. She's been outta high school two years. Perfectly normal. - Well then maybe I'm not normal. (plate clanking) - [Weatherman] In tomorrow's segment. Looking now at our five-day forecast, the west coast will be looking at similar temperatures as the storm which passed Hawaii yesterday has been stalled by high pressure system which continues to build over the Utah/Nevada border. That same pressure system should keep clear skies. (Nancy sighing) (table rustling) - Do you ever get tired? - What? - Everything, everything. - [Weatherman] The Florida skies should continue-- - Is it something at work? Is it me? - It's everything. - [Weatherman] We're looking to continued hot weather right through the 4th of July. - (sighs) All right, this mornin' I got to thinkin' about the car, all right? I have always wanted a Mustang. Ever since I was a kid, I wanted a Mustang. So I get one, only I'm not a kid. I'm-- - You're still young and we still have fun. - Ah, jeez. - You just can't think like that. That's half the battle. - Yeah, what's the other half? - Why don't we just take a couple of days off? Maybe go up to the cabin. - My god! That's exactly what I'm talkin' about here. That's exactly what I'm tryin' to say. God. (sighs) When I first met you, very first time I laid eyes on you, I just knew that this was special. And I loved you so damn much. - You don't? - I do, I do. It is not you, it's me. It's not you, it's not us. (sighs) It's just me. - Tom, it'll be all right. - No, it won't be all right. No, it won't. - Why don't you just talk to somebody? - I am talkin' to somebody. Dammit, I'm talkin' to you! This is a crap week. Look at this, look at this. There's you and a TV and a truck and the bowlin' and you and the TV and the truck and the bowlin' and you and the... I'm goin' out for a ride. (crickets chirping) (soft piano music) (dog barking) (truck horn honking) (water lapping) (loon cooing) (water splashing) - [Bobbi] No. (chuckles) - No no no, you gotta get down low. Throw it sidearm. Way down low, see? - Whoa. - It skips across the water. - I was always afraid I'd hit a fish. - Nah, they see the rock comin' and they swim away. - (chuckles softly) Not if they're asleep. - Yup, even then. They sleep with their eyes open. - Whoa. - They don't have any eyelids. - How do you know so much? (loon cooing) (crickets chirping) - Hey, race you back to the car. And what do you weasels think, the Flash is goin' down the road by himself? - [Driver] You got her ridin' with you, Flash? Over. - Damn right she's ridin' with me. Honey blonde hair and one of those little tank tops. Eat your hearts out. - [Driver] Put her on, Flash. (Bobbi chuckling) - Here, just push that and get him through. - What should I say? - Say hello. - Hi. (chuckles) - Look at me. Say hello. (soft romantic music) - Hello. - [Driver] Hey, you're really there. What's your handle, honey? - What's my handle? - I don't know. What should it be? - I don't know. - Gotta be somethin' special. Somethin' to let him know who you are. Thunderbolt. Tell him you're Thunderbolt. - Thunderbolt. (chuckles) Thunderbolt. - That's because this is one hot lady. (soft romantic music) (crickets chirping) - [Bobbi] Ow. - [Woman] You gotta send these back. They're all stained. (bell ringing) (buzzer buzzing) (woman speaking faintly) - What? - I met a guy. - [Lonnie] No kiddin'. That's great. - And he's just unbelievable. He picked me up after my folks went to bed and we went down by the river. He called me Thunderbolt. (chuckles) 'Cause he says that I'm hot and cool. - (chuckles) You are out of it, sweetie. - I mean the things he says, he just makes me feel so special, you know? - Well who is he? Where'd you meet this guy? - Oh you've seen him. He drives that truck for Maria's Fast Foods. - That guy? - Mm-hmm. - He's gotta be in his 40s or somethin'. - Oh, I don't care how old he is. He's different. He makes me feel really special. (bell ringing) See, I don't go out with guys too much. Not that I don't want to, but they just don't ask me to 'cause I get really nervous. See, I don't know what to say or how to act like you do. All I know is I don't wanna end up like my mom and dad, just havin' supper together with nothing to even talk about, you know? (chuckles) This guy's somethin' else. - I'm sure he is. This guy's married. - [Woman] Carla? - Hey, what the hell? I mean you wanna have yourself a fling, no strings, take a married guy every time. (machines whooshing) (soft somber music) - [Woman] Hurry up, move on. I gotta get in here too. (birds chirping) (dog barking) (soft piano music) - Hi. What's the matter? - A girl at work said you're married. - Me? Married. Well I think would've come up in conversation, Bobbi. - So you're not? - Look at you. You get so serious. You have fantastic eyes, you know that? My brother's married. My brother, Tim. I'm Tom, remember? And if you wanna know somethin' about me, you ask me, not somebody at work, okay? - I'm sorry. I was just tellin' her about you. - You tell anybody you want. Take an ad out in the paper if you like, 'kay? - (chuckles) 'Kay. - You really are beautiful, you know that? But you gotta let people see. Here, now just this. It's all right. There. Now tilt your head up just a bit and wet your lips. That's it. Now smile. Come on, gimme a smile. (Bobbi chuckling) That's better. Now when you walk, you walk real straight and you'll see how people watch you. Go on, walk for me. Come on, c'mon. Oh now, come on. You can do better than that. Walk straight. (dog barking) That's my girl. That's my girl. - [Man] Big man Reece is spinnin' on Thursday. (bowling pins clanking) - Is he crazy or what? (country rock music) He's playin' with fire. (spirited band music) (people chattering) - Haven't you noticed any change in the way she's dressed? Maybe she has a boyfriend. - Well maybe she doesn't. - You ready? - No, I have to wait for some brownies to come out. But you run along and meet your boyfriend, we'll catch up. - What boyfriend? - Bobbi, don't. You think we don't notice things? I mean look how you're dressed. - What are you, a detective? - [Dad] Let's go. - She likes sauerkraut. Put some sauerkraut. - That's enough. - No no no, you gotta taste it. (spirited band music) (people chattering) - You already put some on here. - Yeah, but they're under the sauerkraut. You won't get the flavor of 'em. And a trickle of mustard brought across the top. Bigger trickle, c'mon. There ya go. Perfect. Madam. (people chattering) - Take that one. - Whoa. - He's cute. - This guy is independent. What do bears eat? - Frozen pizza. - Frozen pizza. Yeah. - [Woman] Get two hotdogs. One with mustard. - Bobbi, hi. This is Bruno, Smoky, somebody and this is Nancy. - Hi. - Well you guys enjoy the picnic. Should be nice. - C'mon. - [Mom] Who was that, Bobbi? - I don't remember his name. - Who was that? - From the bowling alley, you remember. Maybe you were in the ladies' room. Let's find that woman. - [Man] Come on over and join us. (people chattering) - [Man] I'm gonna go over there and check that first row over there. - Hi, I just need to talk to Dwight. - It's all right, let her in. (people chattering) Hey, Bobbi. You want the grand tour? You gotta stay clear. This is powerful stuff. Most people think it's for show, just lights and all. No way. This is explosives. You could level a whole building with this stuff. That's no joke. - Who's Nancy? Who is she? - Who told you about Nancy? - I met her. - Oh jeez. What did Tom say? - He said, "Bobbi, this is Nancy." Are you gonna tell me or aren't you, Dwight? - Oh come on, Bobbi. Figure it out. - It's his brother's wife. - Look, he doesn't have a brother. Look Bobbi, you're a sweet kid. But you shouldn't be hangin' around with Tom. Just stay away from him. (ship horn bellowing) (people chattering) (fireworks whistling) (sparklers sizzling) - [Nancy] Oh that looks like a good place. - Let's go on over here. (soft patriotic music) Hi, this place taken? - Help yourself. - Let's sit by the edge, Tom. Well I think we can see just as well from the edge. - This'll be fine. Let's just sit down, okay? (fireworks whistling) Let's just sit down. Come on. Well I just bought fireworks. 4th of July's always been my favorite holiday ever since I was a kid. Independence Day. Had a great holiday? - Yeah, yeah. Great holiday. - Hey, come on. It's your favorite part: the fireworks. There you go. (fireworks sizzling and whistling) (fireworks exploding) - Whoa. - It's like a flower, only it doesn't last. (fireworks whistling and exploding) (soft foreboding music) I wanna talk to you. - I'm late. - Then you'll be later. I've gotta talk to you. - I don't have anything to say. That wasn't fair. - Why wasn't it fair? 'Cause you love me, is that why it's not fair? - Because she's your wife and you lied to me. - I was afraid you wouldn't wanna see me again. - You got that right. - Bobbi, listen to me. Listen to me. I can't get you outta my mind. I have never felt like this about anybody before. - [Bobbi] Well I spent the whole night crying. And I don't know if I'm gonna be able to forget you, but I'm workin' on it. - All right. All right look, I lied about her. Okay, I'm sorry. But I never lied about us and I mean that. I wanna marry you, Bobbi. - Okay, but you are married. - Doesn't matter. - Right, since when? - Since the first time that I saw you. (soft somber music) Since I fell in love with you. - Stop it, Tom. - Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me. She doesn't mean anything to me. I look at her and I don't even see her anymore. A marriage is not forever. - [Bobbi] Great. Call me when it's over. (buzzer buzzing) (soft piano music) (clock ticking) (siren wailing) (dog barking) (birds chirping) - You said to let you know when I had it worked out. - Is it over? - Yeah, yeah, it's over. - Are you gonna ask her for a divorce? - Well there's other ways to end a marriage. - What are you talking about? - Well think on it for a minute, Bobbi. It's real simple. If I leave her, she gets everything. I mean she gets the house, she gets everything. But if she leaves me, she can't very well do that. - She's not gonna wanna do that. - She will. Yeah, she will. - It's the same thing you said last week. The same thing all over. - Bobbi, listen. Please listen to me for a minute. Sweetheart, when I make love to you, I am alive. And the rest of the time, I'm very nice. And she will leave, I will make her leave. - Stop it, Tom. - I wanna marry you, Bobbi. I wanna marry you right now. - We can't do that. - It would just be for the two of us, baby. And that's all a marriage is anyhow. It's just you and me. It would be our secret, okay? The hell with Nancy, the hell with the whole rest of the world. And then once all this is settled, once it's all done, we can get married again in a church this time if you want to. I can't lose you, baby. I love you so damn much. I want you to be my wife. (truck horn honking) (energetic retro music) (Bobbi chuckling softly) You are some Thunderbolt. - You're some Flash. - Perfect. All set? Let's go. (energetic retro music) - Look, Tom. (chuckles) Something borrowed, something blue all in one. (birds chirping) - Now remember, I'm gonna put my name down as Tim. You know, just in case they check. - I love you, Tim. - [Minister] Do you Timothy take Bobbi to be your lawful wedded wife to love and to cherish, for rich or for poorer, in sickness and in health 'til death do you part? - I do. - [Minister] Do you Bobbi take Timothy to be your lawful wedded husband to love and to cherish, for rich or for poorer, in sickness and in health 'til death do you part? - I do. - By the power vested in me by the State of Michigan, I now pronounce you man and wife. (soft romantic music) - You are beautiful, Mrs. Weston. Do you know that? (romantic jazz music) I had no idea kissing your wife could be this good. (Bobbi chuckling) What? - You know what I was just thinkin'? - What? - My folks would just die if they knew. (laughs) - You can't tell 'em, Bobbi. - I know that. - You can't tell anybody. - I just love secrets, don't you? - If you told anybody, I'd have to... I'd have a lotta explaining to do. Nah, you're not gonna do that, are ya? - Mm-mmm. - No. So I don't have anything to worry about, do I? No. (retro romantic music) I'm gonna take care of you, Bobbi, forever. - I'm gonna take care of you too. - Yeah. You swear? - Swear. - Forever. - Forever and ever. (soft intriguing music) (birds chirping) - [Tom] Hi. (car engine roaring) (river whooshing) (soft romantic music) - [Bobbi] I hate going home to my parents' house. I wish we could just live together. - [Tom] I know, I know. Me too. (bag rustling) Where'd you get that? - Oh. I've had it. It's just been in the drawer too long. - I can do that. - I love you, Tom. - Yeah. - What's the matter? - Nothin's the matter. I can just unbutton my own shirt, that's all. (soft soothing music) (frogs croaking) (bird cawing) (loon cooing) - I don't know about that, Bobbi. - Why? I think he'll love it. - [Lonnie] It's short. - I know. Do you think I should return it? - Oh, what the hell? With legs like yours, keep it. (both chuckling) - It's funny, I feel so different. I never would've bought a dress like this before. - You wear that, guaranteed any man in the world asks you to marry him. - He did. - He already asked? - He already married me. - [Dwight] Look, I am not gettin' into trouble like that. I told ya. - I'm just askin' you a little favor here. - You are not asking for a favor. You are asking for explosives. What the hell do you want it for? - You don't wanna know that. - No no, I am not gettin' mixed up in anything. - Dwight, you got that axle yet? - [Dwight] No, I haven't. Just gimme a minute, okay? (soft foreboding music) - It's the Mustang, okay? Damn thing's just drivin' me into the ground. And if I sell it right now, I'll just lose everything I've got in it. - What? You're crazy, you know that? What are you gonna do? (imitates explosion) - Yeah. - Oh c'mon. (chuckles) (soft piano music) - [Bobbi] I just love this place, don't you? - [Tom] Well yeah, but I'll tell ya I don't know whether to feel old 'cause I am the oldest guy here or young 'cause I'm hangin' out with all these kids. - (chuckles) Like me? (motorcycle engine roaring) What? - Somethin' I wanna show you. - What is it? - Well just read it. - It's to you. - Yeah. - "I know you are the Saginaw Flash. "It wasn't easy finding you, but I found you. "I'm sick and tired of listening to you on the radio." What is this, Tom? - Just go ahead. - I mean is it a joke or something? "I'd be careful if I was you, Flash. "Because I'm looking for you "and you'll know when I find you. "This is not just a threat." That's awful. What are you gonna do? - What can I do? Can't very well fall in a hole now, can I? I wanted ya to see this so we didn't have any secrets, 'kay? - 'Kay. - Hey, what do you say we swing by the bowling alley, huh? (car horn honking) (retro rock music) (crickets chirping) You go in without me and don't tell anybody you're with me. - What are you? - I'll be right in. You go ahead. Go ahead. (retro intriguing music) (people chattering) (bowling pins clanking) - Hey, what are you doin' here? - Just thought I'd come by, see if you guys were around. - You mean Tom. - (chuckles) Yeah, I guess. Is he here? (fire crackling) Did he say he was comin'? (car exploding) (Bobbi gasping) Tom! - Hey, what happened? - Tom! (intense retro music) Tom, are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. (car exploding) (Bobbi shrieking) (people chattering) - [Fireman] Far as I can tell, he's not. - Just keep pourin' it on there. (people chattering) - Mr. Weston. - Yeah. - Detective Kostas. - Hi, how are ya? - Oh, I'm sorry. Could we stand over here? I wanna ask ya couple of questions. - [Tom] Sure. - From what the officer tells me is you didn't see anyone? - No, they knocked me down and I guess I was out for a couple of minutes. Anyhow, I heard the hood. I heard somebody running. I stood up and the whole thing blew. - So you don't have any idea who might've done it. - Oh no, I know exactly (speaks faintly). Here, read this. Go ahead. - Somebody sent you this? - No, I found it in the street. Yeah, it came in the mail. You know, I could've been killed here. - So whoever sent you this put the bomb in the car. Is that what you're sayin'? - Well gee, Sherlock. You know, you get a letter like this and then your cherry Mustang gets blown sky-high. How much more would you need? - Car is insured, isn't it? - What kind of a question is that? - It's a routine question, Mr. Weston. I'm asking you if you're covered for this. - Yeah, I'm covered. Of course I'm covered. You're damn right I'm covered. - Fine. So can you tell me who sent me this letter? - You know, he didn't sign it. - Look, if you're planning on going out. - No no no, I wouldn't do that. That'd be illegal, wouldn't it? Tell you what, why don't you hang onto this? Maybe you can find him. - I'll do that. - Yeah. (birds chirping) (dog barking) - Oh, hi. Nancy, this is Bobbi. Bobbi, Nancy. - Hi, how're you doin'? - We met at the picnic. What's going on here? - Gee, I hope we're not doing anything wrong. I mean, I know my mom just hates it when anyone messes around in her kitchen. (chuckles) Mr. Weston said that you weren't like that at all. He just swore up and down that it would be okay. - What is she doing here? - You have to be so rude? - Rude? I come home and this girl is setting up housekeeping in my kitchen? - Gosh, Mr. Weston. I told you maybe this wasn't such a good idea. - [Tom] Yeah, well I guess you were right. Maybe we better go. - What's going on, Tom? - Bobbi, you wanna wait for me in the car? I need to talk to my wife. All right, you wanna know what's goin' on? I'll tell you what's goin' on. Number one: They changed all my routes. Took me an extra two hours to get my deliveries done today. Two: Ben, you remember Ben who used to drive my routes? He said he was gonna show me how it all worked. Only three: Somebody blew up my car in case you forgot, so I got no way to get out to Ben's. Four: Bobbi here, who just happens to be Ben's fiancee and was goin' out there anyway, offers me a ride. Five: She gets here early and she actually offers to fix up somethin' to eat. Only six, seven, eight, nine and 10: My suspicious dirty-minded bitch of a wife storms in here like it was some kind of a vice raid because she has caught us in the act of makin' tuna sandwiches! She insults me, the girl and makes a complete fool of herself! Now you know what's goin' on. Ben's waitin' for me. I gotta go. - Oh right, Tom. I only thought-- - No, you did not. You did not think! (door creaking) Now why don't you go out there and apologize to that girl? (soft foreboding music) (birds chirping) (dog barking) - I'm sorry, Bobbi. - That's all right really. - Well great. Now everybody's cool. Did you see the look on her face like she's never gonna figure this thing out? - I kinda felt sorry for her. - But that's the thing, see? We got her goin' now. She's mad, but she doesn't know what to be mad at. (birds chirping) Drive her crazy. Before long, she's gonna want out. (soft somber music) - [Dwight] Are you crazy? What are you gonna blow up this time? - [Tom] Nevermind that. - What, you got another car already? - Nope, don't have no car. - Look, once is enough, Tom. I don't want no part of this. (Dwight wincing) (tools rattling) - Dwight, the reason I ask you for this stuff is 'cause I expect you to get it for me. If I have to get it from someplace else, I'd have to worry about you, you know? 'Cause you know I've asked. Then I'd have to worry 'bout whether or not you're a stand-up guy. (both chuckling) - C'mon, you know me, man. - Yeah, yeah. - I'm not gonna tell anyone. - I know. You wouldn't do that, would you? (soft intriguing music) - Well he says no problem. We got the cabin for all next weekend. - Ooh great. - [Nancy] Tom, Bobbi's here. - [Tom] Good. Glad I got you food and makeup? - Okay. Hi. Nancy, I just saw the most fantastic outfits. They've got one in the window. It's perfect for you. - Well I don't know. I don't really need anything. - No no no, I'm not kidding. I'm looking in the window at this mannequin and I thought I was lookin' at you. - Oh go ahead. You hadn't bought yourself anything in a long time. - I don't need anything really, Tom. - Oh, sure you do. Just look at yourself. This heat's just worn you down to nothin'. Go on out, buy yourself a dress or somethin'. It'll do you a world of good. - Well maybe, as long as it's not too expensive. - And you don't worry about that. If it makes you feel good, you buy it. Go on. - I'll get my purse. - Okay. (birds chirping) - [Tom] Have fun. - Okay, bye. - Buh-bye. (soft intriguing music) Bye. - Oh here it is. See? This is the kinda thing that would be perfect for you. - Bobbi, please. - I mean it, Tom likes that kinda stuff. You know he does. - You're such a child. - Why? - Well I mean on someone your age it's gonna look great, but I oughta act my age. - Really? Is that how Tom thinks you should act? He's such a nice guy. You're so lucky. (birds chirping) - Well hello, ladies. - [Bobbi] Hi. - Listen, I just got a call from this guy Carl, who says he can gimme a great deal on a cherry Mustang. I gotta go see it this evening. Can you gimme a ride, Bobbi? - Oh, I'll give you a ride. - Oh no, baby. It's all right. It's a long drive and you're tired already and Bobbi's goin' to Ben's. That's half way there. Is that okay with you? - No problem. I'll just drop you off. - All right, I'll be back as soon as I can. How was the shoppin'? - Good. I got the dress. - All right. - Bye. - [Nancy] Bye. (retro rock music) - [Bobbi] The guy said he had a Mustang, right? - What? Look, there's no Mustang. Look, just pull in up here. I gotta make a phone call, all right? You mind? - Just wanted to know what's goin' on. - Well if I wanted you to know what was goin' on, I'd tell you, wouldn't I? - Hello? - Hi, it's me. Listen, I need you to do me a favor, okay? This car's a real piece of junk. The guy wants $1,800 for it. Could you come pick me up? - What? Where are you? What happened to Bobbi? - Well she just dropped me off, you know? She's gone. If I figured I was gonna be drivin' a Mustang back, I wouldn't need a ride. - Can anyone give you a lift? I even know how to get there. - Well I wrote down directions. They're on the pad in the drawer next to the fridge. - What'd you write directions out for? - So I could get here only I forget 'em and I had to call the guy. What the hell difference does it make? - [Nancy] Okay, fine. I'll be there tonight. - Thanks, hun. I'll wait for you here. (car horn honking) (soft intriguing music) (Nancy sighing) (fireworks fizzing) (car exploding) (glass shattering) - Help. Help me! Help! (Nancy coughing) (soft intriguing music) (siren wailing) No, I don't know who they are though, any idea? I don't think Tom knows. - Do you have any idea where we could reach your husband and how, Mrs. Weston? - Tom? Oh my god, Tom. He went up to Midland with Bobbi. - Bobbi? - Bobbi's a friend of his, of ours. - All right, I think I'm gonna have an ambulance take you to the hospital, Mrs. Weston. I think you oughta be checked. Yo, Raj. - [Raj] Yes, sir. - What if they tried to kill Tom? (weeps) - You're gonna be fine at the hospital, Mrs. Weston. There'll be an officer there with you. Take her home. Whatcha got? - Pipe bomb of some kind. I found four of them under the car. Two didn't go off, otherwise she'd be history. - Lucky lady. - That's my wife's car. - I tell you. Someone's gonna be pretty disappointed. - What happened here? - It's all right, let him through. Your wife's gonna be all right, Mr. Weston. She may be in shock. But other than that, I think she's gonna be okay. - Thank god, I was so scared. - You wanna tell me where you've been, Mr. Weston? - You wanna tell me where my wife is? Honey, you all right? (siren wailing) - I'm fine. They gave me something. Tom, I wanna go home. (sobs) - Yes baby, yes. It's what you need is a good night's sleep. I was so scared when I saw the car. - You saw the car? - Yeah. - Tom, what are you doing here? - Well baby, they had the streets all blocked off and I looked over, I saw it was your car. - How did you get here? - Oh, well when you didn't show up, I just got Carl to gimme a ride. It's okay, baby. It's okay. You just rest. You just rest. Thank you, detective. She seems okay. What? Yeah, I'll be around. (foreboding piano music) Hello, Mr. Gilbert. I know it's late, but can I speak to Bobbi please? - [Gilbert] Who is this? - It's just a friend of hers. My name is Scott. - Well she's busy. I'll get her to give you a call later. - No no, that's all right. I'll call back later. Mr. Gilbert, do you know where Bobbi went? - She's talking to the police. A detective came by the house, said he wanted to talk with her. (dial tone buzzing) - Well of course, I know them. They're just about my best friends. - Why don't you tell me where you know them from? - Bowling, I think. Yeah, I met Nancy bowling. Mrs. Weston, I mean. And we got to talking and I would go over to her house and that's where I met her husband. - Tell me about tonight. - Nothing, really. I drove him up to Midland, left him off there. He was gonna see a guy about a car. - Before Midland. - I went shopping with Mrs. Weston. - You know if you're not telling me the truth Bobbi, you could be in a lotta trouble. - Why wouldn't I tell you the truth? (birds chirping) (door knocking) - Mrs. Weston, hi. Rick Kostas. I'm real sorry about botherin' you like this, but may I come in? Thank you. There's just a few questions we didn't get to last night. May I sit down? I was wondering what you could tell me about your husband's relationship with Bobbi Gilbert. - What are you suggesting? - I'm not suggesting anything, ma'am. I'm really just askin' a question, that's all. - She's a friend of ours. - Uh huh, and you met her bowling, is that right? - Bowling? Where'd you get that idea? - I may have misunderstood. Maybe you could clarify it for me. - She was engaged to a friend of Tom's, Ben Lock and sometimes we used to go bowling together. Maybe that's how you got it mixed up. - Yeah, I'm sure that's it. - You know, it's funny. Come to think of it, I never saw her there with him. - Could you come to the office with me? I wanna talk to you please. Not you, Bobbi. - It's kinda funny that you're asking me about that 'cause I mean really didn't know what to believe. - Why don't you just tell me what you know? - Well I don't really know anything, except for what she told me I mean. She never really used to go out much and then she met this guy and everything changed. I mean he was terrific for her. She started taking care of herself, dressing nice. You know what I mean. (bell ringing) A married guy. You know, I guess she figured she could handle it. Do you know what she told me? She actually told me he married her. (bell ringing) - [Woman] Okay, go ahead and take those. - Miss Gilbert, I'd like you to come with me. And if you know a lawyer, I think you better call him. - [Woman] Ready for the second set. (door buzzing) (chair banging) Now you listen to me, Bobbi. We're dealing with attempted murder here. That's a very serious charge. - I didn't have anything to-- - What was going on between you and Tom Weston? And I want the truth this time. - We're just friends, that's all. The three of us. - [Rick] You married him, Bobbi. That's your marriage certificate. Now you wanna start tellin' me the truth? - It was our secret. It was just between the two of us. - But he married Nancy and he tried to murder her, isn't that right? If you had anything to do with that and you don't cooperate with us, you could be guilty of conspiracy to commit murder. Do you understand what I'm saying? (Bobbi weeping) All right. Now, you wanna tell me happened last night? (door banging) - Hold your horses. Hey, hey, hey! Hey, what's goin' on? (grunts) - I have a warrant for your arrest on charges of arson, bigamy, explosives and firearms violations and attempted murder. You have planned this for a while, haven't you, Weston? You blew up your own car, so we'd think there was someone after ya. Then you put a bomb under your wife's car. Bobbi Gilbert got your wife outta the house so you could plant the bomb. She also got you outta town so you could call your wife and make her get in that car. How'd I do? Get this scumbag outta here. - Tom. - [Officer] You have the right to remain silent. - Tom. - If you give up the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. - I'm really sorry. - You have the right to speak to an attorney and have an attorney present during questioning. (machines whooshing) (workers chattering) - I'm sorry, but we just can't have this kind of problem here. I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go, Bobbi. We'll mail you your check. It would be best if you left immediately. (buzzer buzzing) (soft intriguing music) (Bobbi weeping) - [Tom] Dear Nancy, there have never been times when I didn't love you. You must understand this. I've made mistakes. And in my confusion, I may have hurt you. - "I may have hurt you. "But you have to know I never meant to hurt you "and never stopped loving you." He always said he loved me and I always believed it. Whatever happened, I always believed it. - I talked to the lawyer you asked me to talk to. He says no chance at all he can get the bail lowered. - I asked you to talk to Bobbi. - Yeah, you asked me a lotta things. If I'd known what you were gonna do. - I already told ya, don't sweat it. Now what'd she say? - Come on, she wouldn't talk to me. I heard her old man got her a lawyer. - It's okay, it's probably for the best. You know, she's all shook up. - You want my opinion? She could testify against you. - She's not gonna do that. - If she sees a lawyer. (keys jingling) If she sees a lawyer, that's what he's gonna tell her to do. - And I told you she's not gonna do that. You'll see. You'll see. - But you knew he was married. - This was different. It was just between us. - How could you be so stupid? You lose a steady job. Now you get up at six o'clock every morning and slave as a waitress. He ruined your life. - Please, Mr. Gilbert. We have a lotta things to go over. Did you ever talk to him about, I don't know how to put this, some kinda future for the two of you? - Sure, all the time. I mean that's what we used to talk about, what it was gonna be like. - Right, with a wife in his house. - All right, listen. I know you're all upset about this, but Bobbi's facin' very serious charges and we have a lotta ground to cover. I think I'd get a better picture if I could talk to Bobbi alone. - (sighs) Go ahead, Mr. Davis. You're a lawyer, talk to her. Maybe it'll make sense to you. - All right, I want you to tell me everything that happened because you're gonna have to tell the whole story to the grand jury in a few days. - Few days? - It's just a grand jury, Bobbi. It's not a trial. He's not gonna be there and neither am I. They're gonna ask you some questions and you're gonna tell 'em the truth. - That's okay. I think I can do that. - [Mr. Davis] Good. - I just can't testify against Tom, that's all. - Listen to me, Bobbi. He tried to kill his wife. - I'm his wife. - Nancy. He tried to kill Nancy and he used you to set it up. - I don't know anything about that. - But you do know what you did. That's what you'll have to tell the grand jury. And if it goes to trial, you'll have to tell 'em the same thing. He was usin' you, Bobbi. You can see that, can't you? - It's not like that. He just-- - He just what, Bobbi? - I can't testify against him. He's my husband. A wife can't testify against her husband. - In the first place, that's not true. You're not really his wife, Bobbi. - Yes, I am. - [Mr. Davis] (sighs) You've already told the police. You can't back away from that. - They dragged me down there. I was scared, I was terrified. - Whatever you told them you're gonna have to tell 'em again. Listen, it's wrong what happened. It's all wrong. This is your chance to make it right. (soft intriguing music) They'll be calling you in a few minutes, Bobbi. You know I can't go in there with you. No lawyers in the grand jury. - Yup, I know that. - Remember, all he wants from you is the truth. - [Man] Mrs. Weston, I need you to sign out right here please. - [Mrs. Gilbert] Is that her? - [Mr. Davis] Yeah, that's his wife Nancy. - Bobbi, you go up and talk to her. You tell her you didn't have anything to do with what happened. - She hates me. - Go tell her you're sorry. Go tell her. (people chattering) - The grand jury returned an indictment. The main charge is attempted murder. Now I can talk to the prosecutor. See what he's willing to offer. - Bobbi testify? - Yes sir, she did. - Well grand jury's one thing. Let's wait and see what happens at the trial. - I haven't seen the minutes yet, but I'm told her testimony could. - Let's see how that testimony stands up at the trial. (door knocking) I'm not pleading guilty anyway. Yeah, we're finished in here. (men shouting) (birds chirping) - So I said to the guy, "You gotta stand up." You think he does? No. Cops come. He rolls right over. (dumbbells clanking) - Did that to me, I'd have iced him. - Oh yeah? Yeah, well you're in here, pal. - I know some people. He would've been dead. (soft intriguing music) - [Inmate] Oh hey guys. Hey! Hey, c'mon look. - [Inmate] You got a ball? Stand there. - [Inmate] Hey, here. Watch out. - Look out, look out. Look out, here he comes. - Watch the screen. (crickets chirping) (soft foreboding music) (dog barking) (clock ticking) (crickets chirping) - Hey, what're you doin' up there? (Mr. Gilbert grunting) (intense retro music) (Mr. Gilbert wincing) (car engine roaring) (tires screeching) - Are you okay? - Yeah. (siren wailing) - [Officer] Yeah, he's upstairs. Check it up there. (radio chattering) The other side. (sirens wailing) - [Officer] Anything up there? - This bastard ruined my daughter's life and now he sends some guy to get up there? - Wait, you don't know that. - Well you're tellin' me it's a burglary. I got so much valuable stuff, somebody's robbin' the upstairs. - We'll look into it, Mr. Gilbert. - Yeah, I know what you people think about my daughter. You think she's just a tramp. Well you better remember this: You're gonna need her to testify if you're ever gonna convict that animal. You damn well better look after her. - I'll tell the patrol unit to keep an eye on the house. - Yeah, thanks a lot. (soft intriguing music) - What's gonna happen now? - We may need your help, Mrs. Weston. Some of the things that happened that night, Bobbi and you were the only people who could tell the jury about that. - When the bomb went off, I never thought for one minute that Tom did it. Not even for one minute. - But he did, ma'am. That's why I need you to testify against him. - No, I can't. (dark foreboding music) (Bobbi shrieking) - But we need another witness for your case. (Bobbi shrieking) (glass banging) - Let us in! Open the damn door. - Yeah, until the manager comes. - Shut up! - Angel, he'll kill me. Open the door! - He loved me. I know you don't believe that, but he loved me. - No, no. - Get outta here, both of you! Fuck! (intense foreboding music) - Tambien. Por favor, no. - All right, lie down! Lie down! - He loved Bobbi, too. And at first, that really ate me up that he loved her more than me. (intense foreboding music) (Bobbi breathing heavily) - Please. Please. (gun blasting) - I'm so confused, but there is one thing that I'm sure of. He loved me, he really did. He loved me too. - We really need you to testify. I want you to think it over. Will you do that for me? - Behind the counter, sir. (radio chattering) - [Officer] Through with those pictures yet, Brian? - [Brian] Just a few more. - [Officer] Yeah, I'm takin' these out. - Oh man. (radio chattering) That son of a bitch. (soft intriguing music) (birds chirping) (water trickling) (soft somber music) (Nancy weeping) (phone clicking) - [Nancy] Detective Kostas, this is Nancy Weston. I'm ready to testify. - [Judge] Thomas Weston, the jury has found you guilty on the charge of assault with intent to commit murder. I sentence you to the maximum allowed by law, 20 years. It is not generally the practice of this court to impose maximum sentences. There's almost always in the life of each defendant some quality that leads us to temper our judgment. In this case, I can find no such quality. Court is adjourned. (people chattering) - Nancy. Honey, how could you testify against me? I've always loved you, you know that don't you? (soft piano music) (inmates chattering) See the thing is I can tell she's beautiful, you know? And you can tell that by the face. But she doesn't know and she doesn't know what to do with herself. So I buy her some clothes you know, change her hair and she just comes alive. I mean she really comes alive if you know what I mean. I call her Thunderbolt. And she's Thunderbolt and I'm Saginaw Flash, that's what everybody called me: Saginaw Flash. Yeah, Thunderbolt and Saginaw Flash.
