Hey, take it easy! What did I win? The Stones tickets? A hundred dollars? You won, you ready for this? Your own KDED T-shirt! Oh. Trish, honey, where are you? - Coming, Mom. - We're leaving, baby. A little music for Friday morning. And now here's the news with Emma Chapman. Police are still searching for escaped murderer Russ Thorn. Thorn was convicted of the brutal slaying of five people in Venice, California, in 1969. More news in a moment. - How about my blue jacket? Did you remember that? - It's in there. - Okay. The plane tickets, where are they? Okay. - I have them. Trish, the chips are under the sink and there's soda in the fridge, and our number at the hotel is right by the phone. - Okay, Mom. Everything will be fine. - Annette, we have to go right this minute. Mr. Contant will be home all weekend, and he'll look in on you. - Hi, Mr. Contant. - Don't worry, I won't let the girls get into any trouble. Shit! - Annette! - Bye-bye, baby. - Bye. - You lock all the doors and windows. - Mom, I'm 18 years old, remember? You will always be my baby. I'm telling you, you gotta be more aggressive. Okay, who should I ask? Um, how about Kim? - Nah, she wouldn't go with me. - Um, how about that new girl? - Me, ask Valerie? Uh. Wow, this is the real thing. I think I'm in love. Give me five minutes. Hi, my name's Jeff. - Uh. - Can I help you with that? - Sure, thanks. - You know, I've been having some ringing in my ear. I mean, in my phone, and I thought maybe a phone woman could help me. Uh, are all phone women this pretty? I wouldn't know. - Would you ever consider dating a younger man? I mean. You know what they say about younger men. Try it, you'll like it. - Oh, I hadn't really thought about it. - Well, my number's out of order. - Your number is zero. - No! No! - Alright, girls, it's late. Now stick to your zones, try to keep open. Diane, don't hog the ball. Okay, now hustle. Down court, okay? Down court, come on! Come on, okay. - Shoot, shoot it! - Okay, right here. - Two seconds! - Come on, move the ball! - Diane, pass the ball! - Pass it! - Come on. - All right. - Let's go. - Here we go. - Put it up. - Come on! - Oh! - Turn around, that's it. Watch your position. - Oh, shoot. - It's not a smart move, Jackie. Larry Bird you ain't. Now get in range and give yourself a chance. Yes. Boy, that new girl sure is good looking. - Valerie. - Yeah. Let's go Valerie, come on! Let's go, Val! - Alright, Val! Nice layup, Valerie! - Teacher's pet. Come on! - She's open! - Okay, bring it in! - Alright, this is the last week of varsity basketball. Next week, we start tryouts for baseball. Cool down now and head for the showers. You know, I think your tits are getting bigger. Mine? - Hey Linda? - Yeah? You like watching basketball on TV? Yeah, I love all those great big guys in their cute little shorts. How about you? - Yeah, I do, but I love football. - How come? - Brian Sipe is a doll. Yeah, I know what you mean. God, I wish he took his helmet off more often. Hey, you wanna go to a party tonight? Uh, where's it gonna be? My house. - Uh, I don't know, I've gotta study. I got a test on Monday. - Trish, can I have the soap? - Sure can. - Thanks. Hey, Jackie, I could kill you for what you did today. - Hey Trish, remind me: Next time I have the ball don't throw it to Jackie. If I do get the ball to you, don't shoot. By the way, did you see Jim Mcfeeney with Kathy? - Oh, no, are you kidding? - No, I'm not. - Oh, God. - I can't believe it. What a fool! Good god. - Valerie, you played such nice basketball out there. - Thanks, Trish. - The woman gets up her courage and she throws her baby down. And the guy catches it. And, like, the crowd is going crazy. And the guy goes, "Touchdown!" - Oh, God! - What? - I think we should invite Valerie to the party. - I thought it was supposed to be for the game, like old times. - It is. It is. No boys, by the way. Got it? - Uh, we'll talk about it. - No way, my parents would kill me. - They won't find out. - Look, what do you have against Valerie, anyway? - Nothing. She drinks too much milk. - Wouldn't happen to have anything to do with how good of a basketball player she is, would it? - Or how pretty she is? - She works at it. Do you ever notice how perfect her eyeliner is? Just so. No reason to be unkind. I don't like people I have to get to know. - Can I borrow your deodorant? - Hey, it's her problem she transferred here, not mine. - Diane, you're a snob. - Hey, only the best people are, you know? - Well, I'm going to ask her. - Fine. Just go right ahead. - Hey, Valerie. I'm having a few girls over tonight, and I was wondering if maybe you-- - I can't, Trish. I'm, I'm sorry. - Oh, come on - I have, I have to go. - She heard. - I don't know if I can go yet. Mom's on my case about my grades. - Oh. - That's tough. Mine, too, but I'll be there. Jeff, you forgot one small detail: You weren't invited. Trish, I don't let the little details get in my way. - Hey, you guys, I forgot something. I'll catch up with you later. - Oh, Okay. - Bye, Linda. - Hey guys, I've got some provisions for the party tonight. - What are provisions? - You know, Doritos, No-Doz, bennies, crystal meth. - Oh, Linda. Where are you going? - I forgot a book in my locker. There's a test on Monday; I have to pass it. - Okay, but hurry. They'll be locking the building up soon. Hey, thanks Mark. See you tomorrow. - Uh! Holy shit! I think you broke my back. - John Minor, what are you doing scaring me to death like that? - I won't try it again, that's for sure. - Better learn to fall better. You could get hurt. - What about tonight? - Well, I don't know. The party's supposed to be for girls only. For old time's sake. - You can get out of that, can't you? - Maybe. Well, we'll see you around. Take it easy on that back. Back in 1969, our own beach community of Venice, California, was shocked by a string of brutal murders. The man who committed these crimes, Russ Thorn, is the subject of a. - Oh, hi, Rachel! - What are you doing? - I was just putting in your peephole. - Oh, thanks. - Sure. - Oh, did the telephone repairman come by today? Yeah, I saw his van across the street. - Great, you haven't seen my cat around, have you? - Not all day. By the way, your bookshelves will be ready next Tuesday. - Great, thanks, Pam. - Sure. - Buh-bye. - Buh-bye. Diane, what's happening? Well, okay. But you know Mom's gonna be real bummed if you bring him in the house. Just a sec. I think someone's here, I gotta go. - Trish, my god, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. The door was open, I didn't see you anywhere, So I got worried and I came in. I was just checking the house out. - I'm okay, I guess being alone had me more spooked than I realized. - Look, why don't you just come in and sit down for a second? - I'm okay. - No, come on in, I'll stay with you till your friends get here. - Thanks. - Oh, kitty, Muffin, I'm sorry. Oh, Muffin. Kitty, Kitty, here. Oh, here, Kitty, Muffin. Oh, yes, oh, muffin. Honey, it's okay, Kitty. - Let's go by and scare the girls tonight. - But we're not invited. - Just a baby scare. I mean, you know how girls love to scream. - I don't know. - What's the worst that can happen? I mean, so they get mad at us. - They could beat the shit out of us. - That's right, we did flunk gym. Three times. - That's them now. Go ahead and finish your coffee. - Who is it? - We're here for the orgy. Open the door, let us in. Hurry! Look what I scored from my older brother. - Hey. - And that ain't the half of it. - Gee, that's swell. Soda pop. - Right. What's the matter with you? Cast your eyes on this. Maui Wowie, 100 % seedless primed bud. - Hmm. Oh, hi, Mr. Contant. - I was just leaving. Trish, I won't tell if you don't let your parents know I scared you to death, okay? And go easy on the Maui Wowie. - For sure, Mr. Contant. - And if you need me, I'm right next door. - Okay, thanks. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Big doings next door, I see. - That's none of our business. - How come you weren't invited to the party? - I was. I just turned them down so I could take care of my darling little sister. - Like hell. - As the famous Jim Jones once said, "Shut up and drink your Kool-Aid." Hello? Yeah, hold on. It's some boy. - Hello? Hi, Gordon. - Quit glommin' all the chips. - This is the best time to do it, before Diane gets here and eats 'em all. Quit glommin' the joint. - What do the guys see in her, anyway? - She's beautiful. - I think she has a big mouth. - Hey, it's not how big your mouth is. It's what's in it that counts. - What I don't see is what she sees in John Minor. - Maybe what we don't see. - Hey, it's not how big it is, remember? It's what's in it that counts. I left the burner on. - Will your mom be mad? - I'll have to replace it. It's okay. Oh, shoot. - At a recent Tinseltown bash, the lovely Brooke Shields shocked everyone by turning up with a new frizzy hairdo. I thought she looked like Charles II. And her close friends thought she stuck her finger in the wall socket. Dog's in the trash again. - So go take care of it. - What do you think I am, stupid? I'm not going out there alone in the dark. You go. - It's too bad Mom and Dad didn't get a divorce before you were born. - I love you too. - Talk about getting caught in the act, guess who got caught in the act? Who? - Got caught in the act? - Yeah? - Who? - Who? - In bed. - Who? - Who? - Stephanie and Joe. - Are you - kidding me? - Oh my god. - You know what? That must be the reason why she didn't show to class Friday. I have her in my third period class. She wasn't even there. - Well, you know why? Because she was sore. But anyway, you know what happened? They were in bed, and guess who came up the stairs? - Where were they? - They were in her house. - Her parents' house? - Stephanie's house? - Yeah, her parents' house. And her parents came up the stairs. - Oh, well it serves her right. - Oh, my god. What'd they do? - Did her parents know? So they just made it. They didn't get caught. They just kind of flew out. - There she goes. - Really fast. But I'm glad I've never been - So what's the big deal? - In that situation, - Oh, - aren't you? - Me, too. How embarrassing. What's the big deal, I don't get it. I don't get it, what are you guys-- - The parents walked in on them while they were screwing. - I don't think I've been giving Kim the attention she deserves. - Who could have guessed? - Oh, god. - But Stephanie didn't show up to third period, right? - Yeah, yeah. - And Joe hasn't been in class for really-- Oh, God, I bet they're grounded forever. Oh, well, that's their problem, right? - Yeah. - I know, but they almost got caught, Diane. Well, it's their fault. They should have-- - You've never been in that position, Diane. What did we do to deserve this? - I think we died and went to heaven. - Courtney, what are you doing? - I'm upstairs doing my biology homework. - Why do I find that hard to believe? - Don't laugh, I have to concentrate. - Okay, but do me a favor and don't tear out the centerfold this time. - What do you say we order a pizza? - No anchovies. - Mushrooms and olives. - Hey, since I'm the only one dressed, I'll go get wood for the fire. - Bring it in through the garage so you don't scuzz up the rug. - Yuck! Gross. Hi, Mr. Contant. - Hi Diane, I hope I didn't startle you. - No, not at all. You're on a snail hunt? - Uh-huh, that makes 53 tonight. And this is the only good way to get 'em. They come out after dark and they eat up my vegetable garden. - My dad goes on snail hunts too. He doesn't like to use pesticides. - Not organic. - Right. Goodnight, Mr. Contant. - Goodnight. Ah-ha. Number 54. - Hey, did you hear something? - No, I didn't. Look, I've got an idea. Come on. - Hey, listen to this: Boy, 10, sucked down sewer but survives. - Diane! - Why don't you read this thing's horoscopes? - Okay. Sign? - Scorpio, of course. - Of course. - Your power with the opposite sex will get you ahead. - Not too bad. - Depends on whose head. - Taurus. - Taurus. - You get the rest you deserve. Relax and enjoy it. - Hmm. - Hey, is it getting cold in here? - Sort of. - Why don't you read more about that sewer boy? - Fort Wayne, Indiana, a 10-year-old boy who was swept into a storm sewer and carried two blocks before surfacing in a lake, says he knew he was okay when he woke up and the lights came on. Poor kid. - Diane. Did you remember to close the garage door when you brought the wood in? - I don't know. What? - Oh, my god, what is it? - It's my doll. I threw it away this morning. It must be those boys. - Close the curtain Jackie. It's the garage door. I have to go check it. - I'll go with you. Shit, the light bulb's out. See, I closed it. Yeah, but you didn't lock it. My dad's got a lot of valuables in here. Come on, hurry up. - You have to step on it, like this. Everything is okay. Come on. Let's get down to some partying. Fork it over, shortcakes. - Why not, I already finished it. - Pervert. - Look who's talking. - Courtney! - Leave it alone. - Jason is the athletic type. He enjoys bike riding and tennis and surfing at dawn. He's a straight-A student and planning to be a veterinarian. He'll do. - Yuck! - Oh, faker, you were beating off boys in the fifth grade. - I was not, you creep. Donald is a fly fisherman and a gourmet cook. - Hey Val, did you tell mom? - Tell mom what? About the fifth grade? I made that up. - You did not. I hate you. I hate you, you creep! I'll get you for this. - Hi, boo boo. Boo boo? - I love you, too, and I miss you. Yeah, it's okay, Trish doesn't mind. - I don't mind. - I love it, too. Do you think I'm getting better? Shh, hold on. I think our first amendment's been violated. - Not the word I would have chosen. Very immature, you guys. Oh, my god. - Hey, what happened? - All the lights went off. - Here, just a minute. - Hurry up. Here. ♪ Strangers in the night ♪ - Where's that flashlight? - Diane? Where's the flashlight? - I'm looking for it. - Kim? - I'm over here. Kim, where are you? Here it is. By the sink. Well, what do you think happened? - I know what happened. We must have blown a fuse. - Where's the fuse box? - It's in the garage. Cut it out, you guys! What's going on down there? Oh, we'll take care of it. You stay here and talk to Boo Boo. Kimberly, your days are numbered. Come on, it's right this way. Wait for me, I've got the flashlight. - Be careful. - Boo boo. Can you believe it? Jeez, high school boys. Hold it, hold it. Boo! - Who's there? - Me, bimbo. Okay, let's go. God, it's dark. - Where is it? - Shh. It's right over here in the corner. Come on, Kim. - Is that it? - I think so. Yeah, this is it. Hold the beam steady, you hand's shaking. - It is not. Grow up, you guys. - That's weird. None of the fuses are blown but some are missing. Oh, shit. - Terrific. Jeff! - Hey, don't kill me, I give up. - Here are the fuses. - Wow, can't you guys take a joke? How did you get out of the third grade? I can't believe you two. - Look, this was all his idea. - Oh, thanks. Oh, sure. Some joke, you guys. - Get out. - Not again. Courtney? - Get off me, you creep! - Are you crazy? You could have hurt me with that knife! - Not really, it's very dull. Besides, you deserved it after what you said to me. - I apologize, okay? - You have to admit I had you really scared. I admit it. You won't tell mom, will you? Kid, you're a case! Hi, gorgeous. - So let's go. I can't go right now. We'll work something out. Why don't you come on in the garage? - Come here. - You mess up my hair and you're dead meat, Val. - Don't worry about it. - Do you think I'll ever be beautiful? - I don't know, look at me. No, not a chance. - Not if I have the same genes as you, anyway. What's this? - What? You're just a pest today, aren't you? - You weren't invited to the party, were you? - Don't put on so much eye shadow. It's already way too heavy. - Do you think there are boys over there? - Yeah, there's always boys around Trish and Diane. - Well, let's crash the party. - Why don't we change your hairstyle? This one's not working. - Anything is okay with me. - We can try the Brooke Shields look. You know, the frizz look? - Just make me look like you. - Okay. - So Zachary at least made it to the fourth inning, with no runs. The first Met starter past the third in this series. Then Derrel Thomas doubled, and Dusty Baker doubled him in. So much for Zachary. - I think you're gonna have a shiner, Jeff. - Oh. - How are you gonna explain it to your mother? - Aren't you supposed to put something on it? - Have you got a steak? - I'll go check and see. - So then Cey homered. - So far we're agreed. - I don't have a steak. What else can we use? - No, we can't. Not here. - No one can see us. - The girls could walk in here any second now. It's been like Grand Central Station all night here. - Come on, baby, you're driving me crazy. - I can't do it. - Then come on over to my place. My parents won't be home for hours. The girls would kill me. - Trish is very understanding. - Hold on, I'll be right back. - Come on and try it! - Trish, that's ridiculous. Nobody puts a hot dog on a black eye. - Don't be so self-conscious. - Hi, Diane. Hi. What are you making? - Strawberry daiquiri. - We can't figure out who made the runs from last night's game. - Cey homered. - We got that. - Trish? - Where's Mr. Right? - We're gonna go out for some beer, okay? - Hey, don't you want a strawberry-- - She wants a beer, I think. Right? - Yeah, right. We'll be back. Okay? - You don't have to ask my permission, Diane. It just goes to show you can't bring back the old days. - Well, that was a bitch, but now it's done. Oh, my God! Don't! No, no! Please, stop! - What'd you hear? Some honking, and then some screaming. It seems pretty quiet now. - Do you think they're doing something, you know, funky over there? - No, they're just playing games. Forget about them. They're not worried about us, after all. - You know who'd remember? - Who? Coach Jana. - I don't know why we let you guys in with the stunts you pulled tonight. - Here. - Thanks. - Here we go! House specialty. - Thanks, Kim. - Sure. - Yeah, that barbie doll trick was pretty gross. What Barbie doll? - Holy cow, the pizza. I almost forgot. I'll go get some bucks. - We'll get the door. Hey, let's go ask Jana, before it gets too late. - Okay. - What's the damage? - Six, so far. - Six, even. - Hi, Coach Jana? This is Kimberley Clark. Jackie and I just wanted to ask you a question. - What's up? - Did you happen to catch last night's ballgame? Yeah, sure did, it was a rout. - We're trying to figure out where the six runs came from. - Well, let's see, you've got Cey's homer, obviously. - Yeah, you got Cey. - How much? - Four. - Okay, here's one. I'll take all this, you pay with the 10. - Okay. - Okay? Pizza! Oh shit. - Kimberly, is this some kind of a joke? Hello? - We've gotta call anything, anybody, Hello? - Can I help you. - Thank, God. There's been a murder. - Would you like the police department? - We're all alone. Please, please send help. - Where's Diane? - Please send the police. We're at 3664. Hello? Hello? The line is dead! The line is dead. - Well, I don't know, coach. My little sister did hear some screaming, but it seems perfectly quiet now. - [Coach Jana) Do you think you can go over there and take a look? - Well, if you want me to, I guess. But frankly, I'd rather not. - Oh, never mind, it's a bad idea. You shouldn't go out of the house. Maybe I'll go over there by myself. I bet they're having a blast over there. - Well, let me know if there's anything I can do. Okay? Okay, take care. Buh-bye. - I'll go, I'd love to go. - You just want them to see you with your hair up like that. You can't go, it's out of the question, alright? Courtney. I'll tell mom. - I think we should turn off a lot of the lights, close the curtains that aren't already closed, and make sure all the doors are locked. - Okay, it's a beginning. Let's go. Jeff, we gotta do something to help the girls. - Okay, what can we do? - Maybe we should make a run for it. Valerie Bates lives next door. - What if we don't make it? - Maybe we should split up. One of us'll make it, even if the other one doesn't. - Here, this is a good one. I almost took my finger off chopping carrots yesterday. - Now I wish I hadn't dropped out of Cub Scouts. Maybe I would have learned what to do with it. - Jeff, you think this is a good idea? Maybe if we all just stuck together now. - It's the right thing to do. I know it. - Are you guys set? - You have to go through the garage, then Mr. Contant's house is right there. - And you know he's home? - Yeah. If there's anything I know, it's that. You ready? Ready? - Ready! - Are you ready? - Yeah. (Drill clattering Hello? - Hi, is Michelle there? Hello? Anybody? Valerie, anybody home? Oh, Candy, you scared me! - You know what I told you today in school? What Val told me about, you know, the French kissing? With the tongue and everything like that? Valerie, open up, come on! - Hey, Candy, come on. - Open the door! Open up, please! Hey, you're freaking me out. Oh God! Oh, God, please open up! Oh, God, Valerie! Open up, please! Oh, God! Please, Valerie! - He started kissing me, and he stuck his tongue in my mouth. I could have died. I thought I was gonna throw up or something. No, I didn't throw up, I just felt like it. It was so gross. It was all slimy and everything. Oh, I just wanted to die. One. Two. Three. Four. Four, shit! - How long are we gonna have to stay like this? My arms are getting tired. - Until help comes. - If it comes. - You know what? I'm hungry. - Me too. - And what are we gonna do with him? - Maybe we should cover him up. He's dead, alright. - No kidding. - He's so cold. - Is the pizza? - Oh. - Well, life goes on after all, and eating makes me feel best. And I feel bad. Boy, do I feel bad. - Uh. - Ew. - I feel better already. Really, I do. - What? - Shh, did you hear that? What if it's Neil? - Or Jeff? - We'd better open the door. - No! - No! Please! Come on! - Courtney? Telephone! Courtney? Courtney? Damn. Trish? - We have to let her in. It's help, they can't get in. Jackie, wait, Jackie! The knives! Come on! - Hello? Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you this time. - Courtney, I've been looking everywhere for you. - Let's go home. As far as I can see, nothing much is happening around here at all. - I don't know. Seems pretty weird to me. I mean, why don't they answer the door? And why is the house so dark? - Maybe they're just not home. - Look, you stay here. I'm going around to the front just one more time, okay? Trish? Diane? Hello? Trish? Kim? - Trish, I know that's Valerie. We have to answer. Hello? - You remember what happened last time? We should stay right here. If she's here with help, they'll find us. - Trish? - Yeah, and if she's alone maybe that guy'll find her. - Maybe they're friends. Courtney? - I don't hear Valerie anymore. - Well, she didn't bring help, we know that much. - Either she's dead, too, or do you think she's in with that guy? I can't believe that. Kind of an extreme reaction to not being invited to the party, wouldn't you say? - When she called down before, when Jackie. I don't know what to think. - God, that was so horrible, what happened to her. I can't stop thinking about it. Well, maybe we shouldn't talk about it. Oh God! Maybe Diane went to get help. If we ever get through. - Oh, my God! - Quick, quick! - Hurry. - Come on. Get the door, give me a hand. - Courtney? Courtney? Courtney? Courtney! - What happened, what's wrong? - Come on, there's no one here. Let's lock up the house and go home. - Boy, was this a wash. - Yeah, the party must have gone some place else. - Well, I think we oughta get something out of this. Let's raid the fridge. - Come on, I wanna get out of here. I don't know what it is, but something about this house gives me the creeps. - Spoilsport, I never have any fun. Just one little beer? - Courtney, you're underage. Negative, let's go. Courtney, come on! Courtney. - What's wrong? Courtney, run! - Trish? Diane? Anybody home? It's me, Ms. Jana. Kim? Jackie, anybody home? It's Coach Jana. Hey girls, Thomas singled in the sixth. - Shit! - Trish! - You're pretty. All of you were very pretty. Please don't do this. - I love you. - Please, I didn't hurt you. Please don't do this. - It takes a lot of love for a person to do this. What? - You know you want it! You love it. Yes. - Why? I don't even know you. - I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you! - I love you, Val. Val! Kill ya, you son.
