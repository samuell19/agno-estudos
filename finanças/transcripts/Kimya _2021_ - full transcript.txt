Cats are walking on the roof again, hit them with a stick. Sorry, I’m really in a rush, man. Let me just wash my hands. Where were you? My set is awesome, right? I got ten seconds left! This one? Here you go. So, when are you guys coming over to our place? Mert, honey. Come on. Look, there’s a foosball table there. Go play with it. But make sure you don’t touch it all over. We just can’t make time because of work, honey. We’ll come over soon. And the kids could get together. Yeah, great idea! But I really need your opinion on that room. Please, please! Please. Come on. And I’ll read your astrology chart. -Astrology chart? What's that about? -See? Now I've got her intrigued! Hold on! I’ve been so obsessed with astrology lately. It’s insane! I mean, it's all written there. Go on a vacation on these dates, sign papers on these days… Even the ideal days for Botox! I’m telling you, it’s all there! We’re currently in the Age of Aquarius. It’s crazy. See, I’m getting goosebumps here. Ender, hear that? We’re in the Age of Aquarius. We’re in the Age of Aquarius. And you’re an Aquarius, so… -My readings are so accurate, right, babe? -The plane's landing on Daddy! Sweet boy. I wish Mina were here too. They could’ve played together. So let me show you my drawings. And you can read my chart. Oh, my God! Of course, show them to me right now! Ender… Ender? Ender, honey? You seem distracted. Virgo, you know. I mean, like, super Virgo. Go figure! Life must be difficult for you, honey. You want some truffles? Chicki burger? Hot dog? See your angle here? The monthly lunar cycle means… Easy, miss. Now, get some fresh air. -I can stand by myself. -Sure you can, but I'll still hold you. Hey, man! Taxi! Now, let’s walk over there slowly. There you go. Yeah. Easy. Yeah, come here! Easy, Ms. Ozge. No need to rush, getting off the sidewalk now. -Please, easy. -Where to? I’ll tell you when she gets in. Easy, Ms. Ozge. Here you go. All right, hold on. Where to, dude? Don’t get me in trouble, I’m a married man! Trouble? Jeez! Just take her to Alkent Estate. There are loads of houses in Alkent! What the hell? Her friends talked to the security guy! Just drop her off at the gate. Go! Fucking asshole! Watch your mouth! I can hear you. Go! -Hey! I can drive her home. -The cab guy is taking her home. Hey! Look, I can’t take this risk! I can’t take responsibility for this! No way! You know what? You always do this. You don’t even know me! I don’t need to! You were out here, and I got you a customer! That’s the customer? What does that mean? Mind what you say! -Stop banging, lady! Jeez! -I’m fine, I can dance a bit more. Sure, you can dance another time. Your friend here is offering you a ride home. I wanna have that cocktail. What’s it called again? -Espoir-- -Okay, lady, you can have one later. -With cinnamon-- -He’s offering you a ride home. Come on. Just get in the car and drive, man! I can’t, man! Just look at her! I can’t deal with her. -Jeez! -Ozge… Who are you? Ozge, don’t be ridiculous, there are people here. Stop it, man. Hey, get in. Get in? I swear I’ll never pick any customers up from here again! -What you’re doing is not cool. -What I’m doing? We’re outside the bar late at night. Ms. Ozge, go home, get some rest and recharge for the party tomorrow. I will! -Please get in, Ms. Ozge. -I’ll be here. -Espoir! Espoir! -Jeez, stop banging, lady! She’ll stop if you get in! Come on! I’ll never pick up customers here again! For God’s sake, man! Just get in and drive! Don’t get us in trouble! And, you, beat it! Go! Don't throw up, for God's sake. I feel sick. What the fuck is this? Jeez… Here, don’t park it too far. I’ll be right back, man. Thanks! Wow! You’re amazing! I absolutely love it! Gosh! You’re fantastic, girl! What’s your name? Hug me before you fall! I don’t understand. What’s your name? Cecile de France. Come on, hug me. -What? -Hug me! But don’t touch the titties! -Titties? -I mean “boobs”! -I have nothing on me though. -Don’t worry. Me neither. We're not paying? I mean… Something needs to be done about the plastic waste in the ocean too. No one gives a damn! Unbelievable! People are so cruel. They swim and enjoy the beach. Then they leave without even looking back. And it’s not just that. Conservation areas have to be designated. All those signatures are collected, but no one really does anything. Yeah. Sometimes I don’t really know where to begin or how we can fix it. Have some. No, I’m good. Thanks for paying. -What? Because I stole it? -No. Stop watching. Where are you from? What kind of question is that? "Where am I from?" I left my phone at the restaurant. They might get worried. Should we go back? Please take it. You just tasted the poison, you can’t quit now. -Like it? -It’s good. So delicious. You didn’t tell me your name. What’s yours? Wait, let me guess. Berk Can? Wouldn't it be cool? Even better Berkecan? Huh? Seriously? I look that old-fashioned, huh? No, I mean-- Let’s say, not as new as Berkecan. -What do you think happened to that girl? -What girl? The drunk girl they got in the cab. She’s probably watching some TV show at home. No, wait. I'm sure the cab driver raped her. -You can’t joke about that stuff. -Oh, yeah? I don’t need a lecture from you. If you did it, I’d throw you into the sea. -You’re right. -I could do it. And what do you think she’s doing? I'm sure she went to another bar and is still drinking. -Seriously? -Yeah. So she must be even more wasted now. No! They're so gonna give her a hard time tonight. I’m telling you, they won’t leave her alone. She’s screwed. So, you’re sure something bad is gonna happen to her tonight? -Wow, you’re quite the positive thinker! -Hey, hold on. Can you guarantee that it won’t happen? Do you know that babies can distinguish their parents’ voices by the sixth month in the womb? -I do. -Come on. Really? No. Just kidding. Their ears start to develop in the ninth week, and as of the 17th week, they can hear the voices, react to them. And by the sixth month, they can distinguish their parents’ voices. -Awesome. -Yeah. And why are you telling me this? I don’t know, it's interesting. Can’t imagine what those poor fetuses hear. -They don’t understand any of it though. -That's what you think. They sure do. Bless you. Look. One of my ears is bigger than the other. -Really? -Yes, look. I can’t see any difference though. Because you look but don't see, Berkecan. Have you ever kissed a drunk person? -Trick question. -No. I can’t do that kind of thing. -“That kind of thing”? -I can’t kiss a drunk person. -Jeez, you've never kissed anyone? -I have! But I was drunk too. -What about you? -Me? -Of course I have! Yeah. -Yeah. Right. There was this really drunk guy, he was trying to kiss me. Anyway, that jerk was really pestering me. So, I grabbed him, shoved my tongue down his throat. Yeah. And I said, “Come on, fuck me!” I’m sure he’ll have a problem getting an erection for the rest of his life. Served him right though. -Gosh, you’re so relaxed. -What, should I be unrelaxed? I mean, it’s interesting. It's nice. It’s cute. Hey! Captain, take us aboard! -Jeez. What are you doing? -We don't need to beg anyone for it. You’re a strong man, lift it! -Let’s not do this. -Jeez, come on! -It’s heavy, give me a hand. -Fine. Careful! All right. One, two three! All right, wait. Hold my hand. -Easy. -Easy. -Oh, my! -Easy. Oh, no! -Ready? Ready? -I'm ready. Yeah. Hold on. We’ll just look for a friend, and come back, guys. Good night! -Hold me. -Come on, be careful. -Wait, I’ll sit. -Okay. See, my hubby is a Cancer. He's as quiet as a mouse, loves being at home, never leaves my side. That's the man he is, you know. And you’re a Scorpio, so you should also be with someone with a water sign. What do you do? Told you, I’m a singer. But don’t ask me to sing, not in the singing mood right now. Or wait, I’m a captain. Hey, I’m behind the wheel here, so I'm the captain. Gee, okay. I actually meant a racer, you know? Yeah, sounds about right. You would actually make… a good motorcycle racer. -What’s that? -You know, peace? Yeah. You have one kid. A boy. You probably didn’t say very nice things to his mom before he was born. Poor fetuses… I bet you’re married. -I can tell, you smell like barbecue. -Jeez, we were at a kebab restaurant. Ever swam naked? -You? -How can you ask me that? Hey, Berkecan… What is it? Dying in water is a very peaceful death, right? You need to go deep otherwise you’ll rise up. You need to be super strong. I mean, you need to try really hard to drown. It’s hard. But I think it’s great. An eternal silence, just the melody of the bubbles coming out of your mouth. I think it’s an excellent death. To sink that deep, you need to fall from a great height, and that would feel like hitting concrete. You try so hard to stay inside. It’s crazy, right? I wanna go so deep that I can't rise up. And you know that weird electrification when your feet touch the fish in the sea? Wait, you’re one of those people who get restless when a fish touches a tiny part of their body? No, I mean, when you get in the water, you know… -You mean way deeper? -Yeah, way deeper. I think the best fish are there. I wanna be there too. Water is blue, like the sky, or maybe like me. Dying in Istanbul… when… you could live is like a romance that goes to waste. I'm sorry. You’re so cute, really. Hey… Shall we go ashore? I wanna take you somewhere. -Sure. -We’re freezing out here. -It’s a warm place? -Yeah, warm. I’m freezing, let’s go. -Where are we going? -Somewhere! I hope it’s warm over there. It’s warm. Too warm. Good. Because I got so cold on the boat. -So you’re fine now? -Just look at my hands. Freezing cold! Fuck off! -Go, go, go! -Girls! Wish me luck! I'll fuck you all. Gosh, help me! It’s my hubby in there, I’ll kick your asses if you look at him! Wow! Holy shit, girl! You brought your dad along? -Is it the suit? -Just messing with you. Love it, Daddy! -Daddy? -Daddy! So, what are we drinking? -What do you suggest? -I say something old-fashioned for Daddy. -For Daddy? -Sure, I’ll have a whiskey. So get us one whiskey, and one Prosecco, darling. -Coming right up, babe! -You’re the sweetest. -She liked you. -Who? Who do you think? So I don’t look like your dad? You don’t, but you could be my uncle. When things don’t go as planned, just think about the stars. -I don’t get it. -Me neither. I make it sound meaningful, but it’s actually meaningless. Cheers! Who’s she? Your dear wife? -Like her? You want her number? -I don’t even like blondes. So why did you reject me? Well, as long as you don’t reject me… I have a question. Is that a wig on your head? Why? You gonna arrest me because of fake hair? -What are you drinking? -Whatever they gave me! -Drink some water too! -Okay. So, you think that chick likes me? -Wow, you seem pretty intrigued! -No. I think she saw some spark in you. So you could be a regular here. And I start coming here every night, can you imagine? Lose my house, money, and car because of this place. Just be careful. I think you have the potential. I’d never do that. I like it though. So glad you like it. You should bring your family too! -Oh, my… -What? -Look! -Don’t tell me if it’s bad news. -No, a whale! -So? -Just swimming. -Dead? It’s swimming! She doesn't even get it! Okay, okay! I thought it was you! -You’re going abroad. -I’m not that lucky, sis. -You’re so going. -Where is she? -What are you up to, girls? -I’ll do a reading for you too. You haven’t given me a pair of these, so I could enlarge mine. -Oh, gosh! -Come here, darling. You look so pretty. Gee, all right! Hey, buddy! Wow, so surprised to see you in a place like this! How's it going? Fine, fine. You here on duty, Chief? Well, don’t go there. You alone here or what? Hey, listen… There are gorgeous girls in the back! You know, we’re having a group thing. You wanna join us? A group thing at my place tonight! -Is your number still the same? -Yes, Chief. All right, I’ll call you in a bit. You rock, man! -Hey, how about some shots? -Get it on! Get it on! Flatter him! Hey, I’ll be right back. -Girls, wanna go to that group thing? -Where? -Group thing. -I won’t. Just count me out. You ladies are too old for group sex! -She's into another guy. -Fair enough. -What's going on? -The banger is here. Who is he? This is… Kutsi. Hi. I’m Kutsi. -Hi, Kutsi. -Hello, Kutsi. -Hello. Congrats, really. -Hi. It was the most beautiful, most sexy show I’ve ever seen. Thank you. Come here. -Welcome. -Hey, you use protection? -What? -You use protection? -For what? -He is dumb. -I do too, but you’re not inviting me. -Shut up! Osman is my army friend. Adana’s sweetheart. We were roommates when I first came to Istanbul. Honey, no jokes about the army, okay? Okay, honey, sorry, and you scare him by saying Osman and Adana. Jeez! Hey, man, where are you from? I’m also from Adana, mate! -Really? -Yeah. Never met anyone from Adana who’s named Kutsi before. Hey, he looks just like my baldy Behzat. Look! -That’s why he looks so familiar. -Yeah, he really does! Wow, same hands, same feet! -Who's he? -Baldy Behzat is my ex-love, darling. He eventually went back to his wife. -It’s his loss. -True. She’s gorgeous, the queen of bitches. -It’s true! -Girl… Where did you find him? You know, he could hold me, grab me, I’d just eat him up. -Gosh! -Just look at him. So turned on. You shouldn’t spoil these guys, darling. They’ll soon be like, “Let’s cut off your dick.” So? We’ll just use him. Gee, what’s wrong with you today? You just won’t shut up! -Did you call me here today to scold me? -Of course, why else? You help me blow off steam. It's all fine when we're fucking. But after they come, they instantly get over themselves. Fucking assholes! Or we can’t make any money. We were just gonna have kebab at fucker Ali’s place, but we had all our pleasure spoiled. -We had to pay for all those kebabs. -But you enjoyed eating up Ali’s son. He was just a meze. What do you know? It’s complimentary in Adana. -Bon appétit. -You rube! She’s right. Meze and the greens are complimentary in Adana. -Wow! -Yeah. Faggot Osman! Fucking Osman! Come on, love, stop it. Come here. -I couldn’t even enjoy the meze. -Why are you even upset? You have all these friends here. You all dance and have fun together. -You’re all so lucky. -Girl, put on some music! This backstage area sucks, let’s dance! Gee! Yeah! Shake it, bitch, shake it! Let everyone sweep their own doorstep, darling! -Have the energy! -Of course, bitch! We'll shake it off. It’s adrenaline, darling. After all, we’re doing a semi-schizophrenic job here. Such a gentleman! Darling! You’re my buddy in my Neverland. All right, enjoy. Going back in there. We didn't eat anything! So? It was cool, right? Osman really bared her heart though. Respect. If I could bare my heart out once, I’d be so relieved and feel like a bird. But like an ostrich. I’m so sorry! Sorry. It made the night unforgettable though. Where's my phone? I can never find it. I like candid people. At least I know I'm not gonna get screwed. You’re a workaholic? What do you do? I’m a doctor. No, a doctor wouldn’t worry about getting screwed this much. Tell me. -Fine, I’m a doctor of economics. -Seriously? Good. It’s fine as long as you’re not a building contractor. Why? There are good building contractors out there. Wow, you just came up with a great slogan! “There are good building contractors out there.” I bet you’re a copywriter. You’re definitely a copywriter! Oh, jeez! -Babe… -Babe, they’ll deduct it from my pay. -Yeah? -Yeah. Okay, Chief will pay our tab. Right? Chief! You’ve got it, right? We’re cool? You’ve got it? Okay. He'll take care of it. -Good night then. -Good night. What’s your name? Anyway… So, what’s his name? -Kutsican. -Wow! -What’s so funny? -Good night, darling! -Good night. -Good night. You know how to ride a motorbike? -On the water, yes. -Fine, help me. It’s too heavy. Wait, hold on. Let me do it. -Okay, here. -Let me do it. -Got it? -Yeah. -Grab the clutch. -Okay. -Move it here. -Great! -All right, hop on. -Okay. -By "hop on," you mean? -You’re driving. -No way! -Come on. -I can’t do it. -Yes, you can. Just ride through this street. -Come on. -But I’m really scared. You’ll be fine. Hop on. -You think I can do it? -Sure, it’ll go where you look. Just don’t punch it. Come on. -Ready? Here I come. -Okay. -You’re sure? -Absolutely. Let’s go. Jeez, fine. But I’m shaking all over right now! Just hum a song you like. It’ll boost your self-confidence. Okay. Hey! Wait! Wait! What are you doing? Stop it, sit down! We’re gonna have an accident. Hold on, I’m pulling over. All right. What the hell was that? We’re going back? You're driving. -Straight? -Yeah, go straight. People pull over out here at night. -And? -And they make out, drink. -They make out? -You know… They have nowhere else to do it. Or maybe it's just a fantasy, I don’t know. Almost there. You have terrible taste in LPs. Fuck! Light it. Light it! Nice lighter. It makes a heart-shaped flame. You usually walk out here alone at night? I always walk here in the daytime. But looks like it’s handsome at night too. -You think the forest is male or female? -I have no idea. -I think it’s trans. -If you say so. I think it’s nice. Full of love. It holds you tight, pulls you in. -So you’re not afraid of darkness? -Well, all darkness is scary. You know what? After staring at darkness for a while… you start seeing the light in it. Otherwise, all darkness is scary. -You mean hope. -Yeah. I’m terrified of darkness. I used to wet my pants as a kid. So I’d sleep in the living room. I told my ex-boyfriend about it. One day, that douchebag got jealous, so he turned off the fuse box, and locked me in the bedroom. I had a nervous breakdown all night long. It lasted about eight hours. I fell asleep at some point. I woke up, the door was open. That jerk was sleeping in the living room. I was crying so hard. My hands were shaking. So I grabbed the shaver. I walked to the living room, shaved all his hair off. -He didn’t wake up? -No. He almost did. But I stabbed the knife in his face and he died. He couldn’t wake up. You think I’m joking, but I’m serious. And I have claustrophobia. Sometimes I feel like crushing someone’s face, but my claustrophobia stops me, you know. -Ever been stuck in a confined space? -I spent a few days in jail. Then I swore not to run a red light ever again. There are a lot of reasons we could be put in jail tonight, right? It’ll flicker. Maybe it’ll flicker while looking at you? Why are you so unhappy? I look unhappy? No idea. Here’s what my therapist said. "Is it possible that you're always alert and have developed an anxiety mechanism because you experienced what an average person would experience at a very young age? Huh?" -You’re seeing a therapist? -No. Just tell me something honestly. "Is it possible that you’re rejecting nice things to avoid the feeling after something nice has ended? Huh?" You don’t wanna get to know anyone because it makes you feel safer, right? I had this friend who didn’t wanna have kids because of that. And your friend had kids after all? I don’t know. Haven’t seen him in a long time. I wish there were no parents. Even better, I wish they made a movie slamming the “parents are sacred” cliché. It’d be a huge hit. I’m sure something like that has been made. I’ve watched every movie ever made, Berkecan. That movie doesn’t exist. That friend of mine had a kid later. He loves his kid, but just can't show it. He fears something bad might happen to him if he does. It’s also why he’s been unable to hug his father in a long time. In fact, it's all because… he still hasn’t overcome his daddy issues. I feel for your friend. You’re an only child? -I’m the youngest of five sisters. -Wow! So you were raised like a real man? After I became a teenager, everyone started to feed me fruit leather. It was insane. As if they carried it around or something, they’d stuff it in my mouth all the time. I liked eating fruit leather as a kid. Then I hated it. "Is it possible that you have fruit leather related trauma? Huh?" Yes. Good one though. ”A real man eats fruit leather.” Osman has clearly never eaten fruit leather. It’s better he hasn’t. Why would a 20-year-old guy eat it? So? What did you do? Shot some fruit leather commercials with your girlfriends? Why? Do I need to prove anything to anyone? And you’ve made peace with the gay in you? Yes. Fuck those fireworks! Fuck them! You people set off fireworks for every fucking occasion, killing all the birds in the sky! Hope those fireworks explode in your asses! Seriously, this place is spookier than the forest. Come on, I’ll leave a mark on you. What mark exactly? No! Don’t sit there. Over there. Hurry up, we need to go back. Strip. Relax. -I’m gonna clean your gums. -Joking, right? Of course I’m joking! So nice. -Angelina. -So amazing, and they’re so young. And she’s a former model, right? Hey, stop laughing. And, you know, they did it persistently. It really hurts. You’re probably the first person I hurt. If it’s a permanent one, press it harder. -If it hurts, why should I? -You can't escape pain, right? Harder. Press it harder. Almost done. Let’s not go back. -Here, start hiding with this. -Hiding? -Hey, guys! -Hey there! Great song! What language is this? Well, I’m from Elazig. These two are from Siverek. -And that’s an uninvited guest. -Cool. -So we’re just jamming. -Wonderful. Wow, man! Let’s give him a hand! Good job, man! Way to go! I wanna go back. -Thank you. -As you wish, miss. As you wish. There. -Dude! Open the door. -A rose for the lady? It’s not my turn. Want me to get you another cab? -Just open the door! -But I’m waiting for a customer. Who called you? I’m so sorry, sir. Come on, open it. There. Easy. There you go. There you go. All right. -Who’s gonna pay? -Relax, man, they’re gonna pay the fee. -I swear I’ll never come here again. -Come on, man, please. It’s late. I’m dealing with all these people. I carried her all the way here. -I’m fucking exhausted. -I really can’t deal with her. Oh, Sevinc, why are you so upset, honey? You’re so troubled. Hey, I’m just gonna say what I’m seeing here. You guys sleep in separate beds? It looks like it here. But don’t worry, we have the same issue. Sadly, our guys become like that after a while. We’re lucky if we see them. If not, tough shit. You hotspur, you scamp You just call me whenever you want Don’t think I’m crazy about your love Just because I’m patient and say nothing Don’t think I’m a fool Just because I’m being patient I'm just waiting for the right day Thought you could get away with it? Who’ll save you when it’s my turn? Thought you could get away with it? Who’ll save you when it’s my turn? No one ever left you It's all the same to you No one cares about me… Thank you. One day the revenge clock will chime madly Who’ll save you then? Who’ll save you then? You hotspur, you scamp You just call me whenever you want You hotspur, you scamp You just call me whenever you want You hotspur, you scamp You just call me whenever you want You hotspur, you scamp You just call me whenever you want Don’t think I’m crazy about your love Just because I’m patient and say nothing… Do you want sugar? -I want it. Yes. -You, ma’am? -Here. -Thanks. -Stop, let's grab one. -Just walk! -One each. -Forget it, let’s go! Can’t you just wait while I have a fucking bite? You want a flower for the missus? -Here. -Okay. Have a good night. Come here, sweetie. Daddy will sit in the front. They just lock it when they get in, then it stays locked. They open these bars near kebab restaurants. You know, stinky places, who knows what they drink and do in there? And I’m really concerned about today’s youngsters. It’s weird.
