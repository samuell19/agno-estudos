(soft music box music) - [Wendy] If you close your eyes, and you're lucky enough, you'll see a shapeless pool of pale colors hanging in the darkness, and if you squeeze them tighter, the pool will begin to take shape, and the colors will become so vivid that with another squeeze, they must catch on fire. But, just before they catch on fire, just before they do, you'll see it. (whirring) (beeping) ♫ Doo ooh ooh ooh ♫ Ooh ahh ahh ♫ Oh oh oh oh oh ♫ Oh oh ooh ♫ You are cold ♫ You see for me ♫ Things I don't always see ♫ You've seen ♫ You see ♫ Now it's you ♫ I bless ♫ Dragging ♫ Falling ♫ I'll lift you ♫ I'll lift you ♫ I'll lift you ♫ I'll lift you ♫ My hands are strong enough ♫ Strong enough ♫ For two (beeping) (dog barking) (upbeat music) - Michael, before you go to bed, take your bath, and don't forget to take your medicine. - I'm not goin' to bed, I'm not takin' a bath, and I'm not takin' that medicine. Shit, I'm practically grown. - But, you're ill, and the doctor said you had to take it consistently, or else the problems might continue. I'm worried about you. - He's not sick, and it's not medicine, it's Ritalin. - That is medicine. - If you're so worried about me, then why're you leavin' me alone for the weekend? - You won't be alone, Wendy will be here. - Yeah, the mature one will be here to make sure you don't violate your probation, Michael. It's funny, I don't remember my signature being on his adoption papers. - Wendy. - She's right, you know. You two can't be flying off to some fox-trot competition every other weekend, and then playing like worried parents. If you really gave a shit, you'd stick around more. - John, you are 23 years old. You have no job, you dropped out of the community college, and you essentially stay in this rent-free home to play your internet video games all day and night. I'd say my main obligation as a parent has been met. Feel free to fly out of the nest any time. - Oh, trust me, I'm working on it. My internet business is going to be huge, and you are going to regret everything. - Sometimes I already do. - Excuse me, Mrs, Darling? I am happy to inform you that you have become the proud mother of an anemic, Hungarian orphan child! - (gasping) Finally, the chance to experience nature's greatest miracle, the miracle of childbirth! - It is an adoption, ma'am. - Still, the endless paperwork. I feel as if I've been in labor for years. - Congratulations. - (fake crying) Oh, thank you! Here, gimme that. (clearing throat) - And you, Mr. Darling, I'm happy to inform you, you're now a proud father. - Is is a boy, or a girl? - [Wendy] A boy. - Well, then, he'll be the sports star that I never was. - What are you two doing? - We're doing an act, Mother. We're playing at being you and Father. Kids, shut the hell up! - There you are, dear. - What's the matter? - This goddamn tie, it won't tie! It ties around the bedpost, but it won't tie round my goddamn neck. - Well, where's Liza? - Downstairs, confirming our flight. - Is there a problem? - Yes, the problem is this tie! If this tie won't tie around my neck, we are not going to the competition tonight! And if we miss the dance tonight, we won't got to Tampa for the nationals, and we can kiss any chance of a title, any chance of endorsements goodbye, and if all that falls apart, then we'll all starve, and those children will be thrown out in the street! - I am not a child. I can take care of myself. - Then move out, already! - Don't worry about me, I'm leaving for college-- - I wasn't talking to you. - A college that's very far away. And I'm gonna major in Social Services and Human Development, so I can save children like me from childhoods like mine. - Hey, shut the hell up! - We gave you everything! - Gymnastics lessons for four months is not everything. - There you are, all set! - That looked difficult. - You constantly bitch at me about being self-reliant, and Mr. Darling can't even tie his own necktie! What kind of model are you setting up here? - Shut the hell up! - I can't take another minute of this, this is too much! And Wendy, make sure Michael takes his medicine, and try to keep him from breaking his curfew. And this is for you too, John. We've noted the mileage on the Jag's odometer, and we've hidden the key, so don't even think about it! Now, we'll be gone all weekend, so make sure Nana gets fed, too. - Isn't that Liza's job? I mean, what are they paying Liza to do? - They're paying her to do Michael. - [Mrs.] John! - Seriously, you have this personal assistant that gets your film developed, and fills your propane tank for parties, and as I recall, you originally hired her to keep an eye on Michael. Why is Liza always getting paid for what ends up being my responsibility? - Because you are a responsible young woman. - Well, you just watch, by the time you get back from your cha-cha talent show, I'm gonna have addictions and a record! Maybe I'll be pregnant. - Wendy! - I'm getting out of this house! - Don't be ridiculous, you're too level-headed for that nonsense! - There's no reward in being the level-headed one! Absolutely no reward! I could be crazy. (ominous music) You watch me. (ominous music) (dog barking) (crickets chirping) (footsteps clicking) - Ugh, what about Nana? - [Mrs.] Maybe we should leave her in this weekend. - [George] Are you kidding? The house would be destroyed. You we really should stop adopting things. - [Mrs.] George, I think we should keep her in, and I'll tell you why. Last night, when I was upstairs, I saw a face at the window. It was the face of a boy, and he was trying to get in. - [George] A face at the window, that high up? I doubt it. - I distinctly saw him! But, I haven't told you everything, I'm afraid to! - Why? - Oh, you'll think it's just another one of my hallucinations, or you'll think I've been drinking! - [George] What is it? - (sighing) When I looked out the window, yesterday, there was this, I don't know how to describe it. There was this tiny little girl, with lights in her hair and silk wings, and she was darting about like she was on some sort of stimulant. - Mary, I don't have time to listen to one of your stories! We have to go! - Sorry it took so long, and now you're confirmed on the red eye, but you have to leave the competition by 10:30. - And if we don't? - [Liza] Just try to make it. - But, if we don't? - Well, then, you probably spent too much time asking me what would happen if you don't make it. (sighing) Now, I won't be here Monday, but I will be by Tuesday. Have a good time! - Oh, and the gardener called and said he didn't get paid. - I sent the check. - Are you sure? You've been taking quite a few days off, lately. - I'll handle it, have a good time! (door slamming) Hope you break your legs. (footsteps stomping) (wind blowing) (intense music) (pulsating) (crickets chirping) (dog barking) (blinds rippling) (ominous music) (music swelling) (pulsating) - Tinkerbell, Tink get outta the bottle! Where do you think they put 'em? - Well, fuck if I know! - Will you look around for the keys? Try back there. (intense music) - [Wendy] Hey, boy, why're you crying? - Shit, you scared me. What's your name? - My Name is Wendy Moira Angela Darling. What's your name? - Peter Pan. (crickets chirping) - That's it? - Yeah. - That's a shame. - It's no big deal. - Were you lookin' for these? (keys clanking) - Yeah, I was lookin-- - I found them on the ground out back, and I held onto them. I've seen you coming back looking for them, Why didn't you just knock on the door and ask for them? - I don't get along well with rich people, adults. - Where do you live? - Second star to the right, and straight on till morning. - Cut the bullshit and tell me where you live. - That's where I live! - That's a funny address. - No, it ain't. - That's where you get your mail? - I don't get mail. - But your mother gets mail. (crickets chirping) - Don't have a mother. (crickets chirping) (keys clanking) - Don't touch me. - I was just gonna give you your keys back. - Oh. - Why couldn't I touch you if I wanted to? - Nobody touches me. - Why not? - They only touch me if I let them. - You givin' me my keys, or not? (crickets chirping) (soft music) - This is your car? - It's tight, huh? - Somebody should wash it. - It's a fuckin' car, where's your car? - How old are you? - I dunno, I lost track, I'm young. I ran away from home when I was younger. - Ran away, why? - I heard my parents talkin' about what they wanted me to be when I grew up. They had all these hopes and dreams for who I'd turn out to be, and I didn't want that. Then my old man bailed and my mom just freaked out, so, I ran away. Got on a bus, and now I live here. - Where, exactly, do you live? - I live among the fairies. - Oh, so you're gay? - Hell, no, I'm pan-sexual! - What does that mean? - It means I like sex. (chuckling) (car door slams) - And you like to hang out with fairies? - Yeah, they're nearly all dead, now. - Oh. - You see, Wendy, when the first child laughed for the very first time, that laugh broke into like, a million little pieces, and they all went skipping about. That was the beginning of fairies. Well, we all grow up so fast nowadays, and everyone takes everything so fuckin' seriously, and they start to lose their imagination, and they start to believe that there are no strange and fantastic and beautiful things. (crickets chirping) Every time someone says, "I don't believe in fairies," well, there's a fairy that falls down dead. They overdose, or they get sick. It's like they were never there. (crickets chirping) Do you believe in fairies? (crickets chirping) - I'm still tryin' to figure out how your keys got in our yard. - (chuckling) We were drivin' through the neighborhood, and our car ran outta gas. Tink got pissed and threw 'em over the fence. We got gas in it, but then we didn't have the keys. - Who's Tink? - Tinkerbell, she's a fairy! - You silly ass, you left me alone in the model home. - Tink, this is Wendy. - Nice to meet you. - She's not very polite. - So, where're you guys goin' now? - Home. - I still don't know where that is. - We live with The Lost Boys. - Who're they? - Guys like me, runaways. We stay in Neverland, we'll find a place, and we stay there. - Neverland, what's that? - You don't know about Neverland? - No. (giggling) - Map's in my head. It has zigzag lines with splashes of color hidden in it. - You are so strange. - Yeah, well, I think you're a big, ugly girl, and you should mind your own fucking business. Oh, and, if you think you're gonna hang out with us tonight, you're wrong, Peter's with me. - Tink, you know you're not my fairy! - Oh, why can't I be your fairy? - 'Cause I'm gentleman, and you? Definitely not a lady. - I'm gonna get a bottle for the road. - But, we just got you a new bottle. - Yeah, well, we've been here three hours, I'm sure the boys have drank it by now (smooching). (ethereal music) (crickets chirping) (dog barking) (car door slamming) - What's Neverland like? - It's fuckin' tight. Like everything cool, in just this one place. And there's no bad stuff like school, or church, or fathers, or braces, and there's tons o' rides. - Sounds like fun. - Yeah, I mean, it gets lonely sometimes, but then you just get over it, ya know? (ethereal music) (crickets chirping) (heart beating) - I wanna kiss you. - Kiss? - You know what a kiss is, don't you? - Don't touch him. - Tink, get in the fuckin' car! - I will do this every time you try to kiss him, you silly ass! (heart beating) - You should come with us. - Are you sure, what about her? - Ah, she'll get over it, she's just a little fucked in the head. - But, can I bring my brothers, too? I mean, I don't know anybody, and-- - Yeah, no, they can come, we'll all go. We'll fly there. - Whadda ya mean by that? - We'll fly, I'll show you. I'll show you how you can jump on the wind's back, and then away we'll go. (ethereal music) (crickets chirping) (heart beating) You know, Wendy, when you're up there sleeping in your silly little bed, you might be flyin' around with me sayin' funny things to the stars. - [Wendy] John, c'mere, this guys gonna teach us how to fly! - What? - You just think lovely, wonderful thoughts, and they lift you up into the air. And you need the fairy dust. - What's that shit? - It's fairy dust. (ethereal music) - Sweet. (bouncy music) - I don't think you can handle it. - Why not? - There are pirates. - Pirates? - What kind of pirates? - I call 'em butt pirates. - Peter! - And Indians, and mermaids. - How do we get there? - Second star to the right, and straight on till morning. - Oh my god, Wendy's high! - I am not that high. - Well, you're not making any sense. - You don't have to, I say whatever comes to my head, and there's nobody around to tell me that I'm wrong or stupid. You try it. - Try what? - Saying whatever comes into your head! - Okay, um, I see a flamingo flying over a lagoon. - I see a lagoon flying over a flamingo. - Now ya get it. - I see a ship, and a cave, and a mysterious river. It will be such an adventure. - You know what I see? - What? - What? - I see a man with a hook, (ominous music) and this man with a hook is the worst of 'em all. - What's he like, is he big? - Yeah, he's big, but not as big as he was. - Whadda ya mean? - Well, he did a lot of drugs. - Is he real? - Terribly real. - The hook, tell us about the hook. - Well, he's got an iron hook that hangs from a beam down below, and he strings people from it, boys. - He does this in Neverland? - In dungeon, underground. - And this pirate wants to string me from his hook, most of all, but there's one thing that you gotta promise me. If we run into Hook, and even if he gets violent, you gotta leave him to me. - Yeah! - Okay, okay! - Okay! (ominous music) - You still wanna go? - Yeah! - Sure! - Then let's fly. (distorted music) (drum-heavy rock music) (car peeling out) (drum-heavy rock music) (freefall car squealing) - Where's Peter? - I dunno, but he's been gone for almost six hours now. God, I wish he'd get back! He left with the swankiest blonde in his car, and I wanna blaze it. - Right on. - Dude, I get freaked out when Peter hasn't come back for a while. Those pirates, they kinda make me nervous, and, well, Peter knows how to deal with them the best. - Well, I'm not scared o' those fags, I'm not scared o' shit, I just want him to bring back the weed. - [Tootles] Last night I dreamt the prince found Cinderella. - Right on! - Dude, Tootles, so queer! - The only thing I can remember about Minnesota, the one thing I miss most about it, I guess, is, when I was younger my mom used to read me Cinderella. I always thought she was Cinderella. - [Announcer] Pleas remain seated at all times. - You are Cinderella. (Announcer speaking in foreign language) - [Announcer] Attention adventurers, Tiger Lily's Native American Revue will begin in just 15 minutes-- (laughing) - Hey guys! - I'm gettin' sick and tired o' pushin' Tinkerbell's kid around. - Yeah, she's gonna have to find a babysitter from now on, and it's not gonna be us. - Has he eaten? - Yeah, we fed him a churro and like a cherry icy freeze around four o'clock. - That doesn't sound too healthy. - It's fuckin' ice and juice. - No, the churro isn't healthy! - Hey, hey! - [Baby] Mommy! (crying) - Let's go on the Log Rammer. - Right on! - Hey, we can't go on any rides with this kid! - Yeah! - Just use my chain to lock him to the bike rack. (baby whining) - Cool. - You wanna see Mama? Come right over here, we'll take you to Mama, watch, you're gonna hang out right here, she's gonna be here in just one minute. - Shh. - Hold him down. - [Baby] Ow! - I'm glad I'm not a parent. Kids fuckin' suck! (laughing) - (mumbling) Mommy! (indistinct chatter) (intense music) (distant amused shrieking) - Captain, I saw them. - Put your pistol away, Smee, you're causing a disturbance. - It was a few of those boys you want. Shall I after 'em? Tickle 'em with Johnny Corkscrew? Johnny's a silent fellow. - Was Peter with them? - No. - I could get one ore two, but I'd sure like to mischief all the seven, especially Peter Pan! - Hang him from the hook? - Oh, yes, I've waited a long time to shake hands with him with this. I'll tear him. - I've often heard you say that your hook is worth a score of hands. For combing your hair and other homely uses. - If I was a mother I'd pray my children were born with a hook like this. I mean, I know it's just a costume, but I've always said, Smee, you've really got to commit to the role. You see, at Neverland, I'm just not the head of maintenance, and you're not just part of the crew. We're putting on a show for these guests, and we are the cast members. We have to provide the magic, and the happiness. And those little hoodlums running around with their Ecstasy and their clove cigarettes, they're ruining our image as the friendliest, funnest, cleanest, happiest place in the world. - Aye. - [Announcer] Attention, Neverland adventurers, will the parents of a small boy with spiked hair and leather bracelets please report to lost and found? Thank you! - Oh, there you are, Hook! I've been callin' you since last Thursday-- - Oh, for God's sake, put your head back on, you're on stage, the guests can see you! - I can't talk to you with my head on! Look, I just wanted you to know, I had a really good time the other night, and I was, you know, wondering when we could do it again? - Get it on, fool. - I know what's been going on with you and some of the other guys, you know, what goes on when the park's closed, right, how can I get in on some of that action-- - If you need to talk to me, you can make an appointment through Cast Member Services. Smee and I are in the middle of a meeting! So, if you'll excuse me. - I can keep a secret, just let me in on some of the fun! - Not now! I'm very busy. - [Crocodile] I can keep a secret! - I've lately noticed your strange fear of crocodiles. - Not all crocodiles, that one crocodile. I was a little out of sorts one night, a little inebriated, maybe, and, well, that brute liked the little bit I gave him so much that he's since then been following me all around the park, from land to land, from sea to sea, licking his lips for the rest of me. I'm considering a restraining order. (distant music) (indistinct chattering) - I would crawl through the sewers in Neverland if I could bone Tiger Lily. - Tiger Lily is a man. - No, she's not, men don't have tits that nice. - Dude, they've been doin' breast implants since before we were born, they're fake! - I don't give a shit if they're fake! (announcer speaking in foreign language) Oh, would you just let me enjoy the fuckin' show, already? - I knew you guys'd be here. - Hey, where's Peter? - He's going back to the hideout. - You get his car? - Yeah, oh, and he's brought someone along. - What's his name? - It's a girl. - Right on! (all a laughing) - She's such a bird, her name is Wendy, can you believe that? - [Boy] Wendy-bird! Peter's actually like so annoyed with her, she practically invited herself along. - Welcome, adventurers, to the Neverland Themed - I think she thinks-- Amusement Park's - Shut up, the show is starting! Big Top Theater! Please be reminded - Shut up! - that food and drink are not allowed in the auditorium, and flash photography is strictly prohibited during the performance. Now, sit back, (Native American drum music) relax, and enjoy Neverland's tribute to Indian culture and custom! (man chanting) Tiger Lily's Native American Revue! (performers chanting) (spacey techno music) Ladies and gentlemen, Indian Warriors and Indian Maidens, Neverland proudly presents the sexiest squaw since Sacajawea, Miss Tiger Lily!

Mama's ready for some action! (distant rock music) - [Announcer] Howdy, folks, there's a train a-comin'. For your safety, please remain behind the yellow line, thank you. (bell ringing) (train chugging) (eerie music) (drum-heavy electronic music) (laughing) (creaking) (laughing) (stomping) (light thudding) - Where'd you guys go? - We were watching the Indians, again. - You guys, this place looks small, but it actually has a lot of space! - Yeah, a few more square feet, and it'd be almost as big as your ass! - Tink, I told you to be cool, now get outta here and don't' come back till you calm the fuck down! - But, I'm your fairy! - Just get the fuck out. - Fine, you can kiss my ass. - No thanks. - Or, maybe you don't like the ladies? - Get out. - Fine, but when you're outta fairy dust, don't come lookin' for me, fuck-head. - I made her mad again. - She's moody. Hey, Wendy snuck out of her house. - [Wendy] I didn't really sneak out. - She's got a family with a real nice place, but she's gonna hang with us tonight. - Do you know any stories? - I know lots of stories. - [Boy] Do you know Cinderella? - Dude, you're embarrassing me. - Yeah, I know Cinderella. - Would you tell me the story of Cinderella? - She's not your fuckin' mother, okay? - Peter, it's okay. - Well, I think Wendy should be the mother. No, seriously, we could just kick back, and listen to stories and shit. - Right on. - Okay. - Wendy's the mother! We have a mother. - Peter, you can be the father. - Hey, I'm nobody's father. I ain't even gonna pretend to be nobody's father! - That's not what Tink said. (boys chuckling) - Peter, it was just a joke. What happened to your imagination? - Hey, come on, Wendy, let me show you around. Let's leave these losers to jerk each other off. - John, Michael, you wanna come? - I'm cool. - You know, I think that we're gonna, uh, kick it here, for a while. (clearing throat) (ominous music) (footsteps pattering) - Okay, just act cool, stroke their egos a little bit, ya might score some weed. (laughing) - They're just strippers, man. - Strippers with weed! (all laughing) - Right on! (intense music) - Hey, is Peter here? Did somebody order chicken? - Well, we just thought Peter was around here-- - Who are the new ones behind you? - Uh, that's John and Michael. They're friends of Peter's. - [John] Is that a guy or a girl? - That's an Indian. (boys giggling) - Did you all see the show? - A thousand times. (boys giggling) - And it's based on a rain dance that was done on a war path. I'm 1/8 Cherokee. I'm 1/8 everything. - I can see that. (boys giggling) - So, you're a friend of Peter's. Peter Pan saved my life. I was, um, sexually assaulted here in Neverland one night. Have you heard the story? - No. - Oh, well then have a seat. We smoke-um peace pipe. - (mumbling) Peace pipe. (ethereal music) - [Peter] So, I'm gonna show you somethin'. - [Wendy] What? (giggling) Whaddaya gonna show me? - Close your eyes. - What? - Close your eyes, don't look! (laughing) - Wait a minute, guide me. - Okay. - Okay. (soft music box music) - If you close your eyes, and you're lucky enough, you'll see a pool of cool colors hanging in the darkness. If you squeeze tighter, the pool begins to take shape. And then the colors become so bright, it's like with one more squeeze, they're gonna catch on fire, but just before they do, right before they catch on fire, - Uh-Huh? - then you'll see it. Open your eyes, Wendy. (soft music box music) - It's a carousel. - I know that. - It's incredible. - I know. See, you don't have anything like this at your house, huh? - No, no we don't. - One day, I'm gonna be so rich, I'm gonna have one of these in the back yard of my mansion. And I'm gonna have parties, and my friends are gonna come over and we're just gonna hang out and get wasted and spin around all night. This thing is a trip when you're really wasted. It's a fuckin' trip! - (chuckling) This is a trip. - You like it? - I like you. (chuckling) (soft music box music) (carnival music) - So, whaddaya wanna be? - Huh? - Like, when you get older. - It seems like you have all these big dreams, and I was wonderin' what you wanted to be? - Rich! - (laughing) That's good, but, I mean, whaddaya gonna do to get rich, for a career, I mean? - Oh, you mean like a job? - Sort of. - Yeah, I'm no dumb-shit, Wendy. I'm not gonna have to sit behind some desk and do a bunch of stupid crap to do what I want. - What's your plan? - Plan? (zapping) - You know what, I have been here before. (eerie zapping) I just didn't know what Neverland was when you said it. (softly chuckling) - You've been here before? - Mm-Hmm, once, in the 10th grade, with my boyfriend. - Oh, you have a boyfriend! - No. - Where's your boyfriend tonight? - He's dead. - What happened? - I dunno, it's hard to explain. He had all these plans, all these big dreams, I guess. But, I dunno, he was either too weak, or too lazy to keep tryin'. - That sucks. - It doesn't bother so much as it used to. Besides, I have my own dreams, my own plans. - What's your plan? - I plan to stop dreaming so much. Come on, let's get on the carousel. (ominous music) (smacking) (creaking) (slamming) (ominous music) - I was young, once. There was a time when I had the future at my fingertips. And, now, the future has me by the balls. Did I ever tell you I studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London years ago? They said I could have been another Olivier. Did I ever tell you that, Smee? (intense music) As I was saying, I was young, once. So, it's not that I don't understand that Peter and these boys just want to have a nice time. They just can't have their good times at the expense of Neverland's image! Now, there's clear evidence that these boys have found some area inside the park, in a backstage area, where they actually live. They're spending the night here, which makes them not only privy to many of the secrets, many of the, many of the secrets that make Neverland one of the premier tourist attractions in the area. These boys are leaving Neverland open to incredible lawsuits! Now, I didn't get promoted to director of maintenance by sitting around and letting teenage boys destroy this establishment. I got to this position by giving a damn, and I expect all of you to give a damn, too. (ominous music) Many of you are close, personal friends of mine. We socialize together. Some of you I met online, or through one circumstance or another, that's why I hired you. And, it's our job to clear the stage of these hoodlums. What dark and devious hole have these young boys crawled into? It's our job to find out. - [Tink] Excuse me. - Who let you in here? - Well, there are so many ways to get around Neverland, you're just not small enough to have discovered them all. - Smee, show her out. - Just a little sprite who runs with the Boys, Captain. - Why yes, it is. ♫ I know where the Boys hide I can show you where to find Peter Pan. (intense music) - Well, young lady, lead the way. - [Wendy] Okay, what about this guy with the hook? - What about him? - He's real? - Look, Wendy, everything's real, even the guy with the hook! - Tell me about him. - He hates me and the guys. He's old, and he doesn't want anyone to have any fun. - I see. - Look, Wendy, I always wanna be young and happy, ya know, and I think everyone else wants that. Look, people are, they're assholes, ya know, they get caught in these traps. They grow up, they get all these stupid responsibilities, and that's just not gonna happen to me. - But that's up to you! - I mean, sometimes I get lonely, think about what it'd be like to have a family. Have everything organized, so I didn't have to worry, ya know, about some of the shit that goes down around here. (carnival music) It's scary, ya know? - [Wendy] What is? (carnival music) - Nothin'. (carnival music) Hey, Wendy! (carnival music) - Yes, Peter? - It's just pretend, isn't it? That I'm the father and you're the mother? - Peter, of course it is, but we can pretend like they're ours, Peter, yours and mine. - But, they're not, really? - No, not if you don't wish it. (carnival music) - I don't. (carnival music) - Peter, what are your exact feelings for me? - Whaddaya mean? - Like, how do you see me? - I dunno, you're how a mother should be! Guess the guys are right. (carnival music) - I thought so. - You're so strange, Tink is the same way. I know chicks want me, but I told you, I'm not gonna get caught up into that. - (scoffing) you're awfully arrogant. - Don't trip, Wendy, can't help it sometimes. I'm just happy with myself. - Yeah, you're pleased with yourself, now, but what happens when you get older and you're not so good-looking? What happens when you get too old for Neverland? What happens when Neverland closes down? - We stay here even when it's closed. We've got the hideout, remember? - I mean when this place closes down, years from now, when this is just parking lot or something else? - You're the one with the imagination. - Everything closes down, eventually, everything changes, people change, people grow up. - Then there'll be a new Neverland, with new fairies, and pirates and Indians, and-- - Peter! - What? - You are going to go to the grave believing that! - [Peter] To die will be a great adventure! (carnival music) - So, Peter got in, somehow, and Hook was exposed and preparing to attack me, and Peter grabbed one of the weapons that Hook has laying everywhere, and used it. He hammered him pretty good down there, and that's the real reason they call him, "Hook." I think Peter actually broke the man's equipment, shall we say? (soft rock music) you know, he says it's all about the show. He acts like he's so by the book, and above board, but he's really a pervert, I mean, he does all of his kinky shit right here in Neverland. - What are you talking about? - Neverland can be real scary. - Mm, he'll get you, too. He will, if you stay here long enough. He'll get you. - Okay, why doesn't anybody do anything about this? Why doesn't somebody say something? - It's Wendy, Wendy tell us the story that you promised. - Where've you two been? - We've been around. - Was he good, Wendy? - I was great! - Tell the story, tell the story! - I think my stories are too graphic for the little boys. Why don't you come tone things down a little? - All right. (ethereal music) Once upon a time, there was a gentleman, - I wish it was a lady. - There was a lady, also. (giggling) - Right on. - Be quiet. - Um, there was a lady, also, okay, and her name was Mrs. Darling, and her husband was Mr. Darling. - Oh, I think I know these people. (giggling) - The Darlings were married, and they adopted three ethnic children so that they could appear fashionable to their high society friends, (chuckling) which wasn't all that high of a society, but don't tell that to the Darlings, or else they'll think you're being rude. (chuckling) Anyway, um, Mr. Darling was a colossal asshole who was always angry with the kids, or the dog, and everything, (chuckling) and Mrs. Darling was always on scotch, or painkillers, or both, so the children decided to fly away. So, when a boy the hardly knew came to their house, they flew away to Neverland, where The Lost Boys are. - Ha ha, I knew that was gonna happen! Don't ask me how, I just knew. - Was one of The Lost Boys like me? - (giggling) Mm-hmm, he was exactly like you. - I'm in the story! Guys, I'm in the story! Fuckin' famous. - Shut the hell up! - But, as careless and self-obsessed as the Darlings were, the children soon realized that maybe the grass wasn't that much greener in Neverland, or anywhere else. I guess everyone's living in their own world, wherever you go, and, maybe there isn't some perfect place where everything is wonderful all the time. Maybe Neverland is all in your mind. And so, the kids decided to go home. - Why did they go back home? - Well, I think that they understand that everyone has to grow up, eventually, and everyone has to assume responsibility for their own actions, and that nobody can live in a fantasy world forever, and that no matter what, the doors to their home would always be open to them with a mother and a father, too, and even though it isn't perfect, it is safe, it is something. And it really isn't all that bad. Or, at least it could be worse. - You're wrong, you're wrong about mothers, and families, and homes and all that shit! I used to think like you did, and after I ran away, I tried goin' back, but my mother had forgotten all about me. She'd moved away. You're full o' shit. - Are you sure all mothers are like that, Peter? Maybe it was just your mother. And maybe something happened to her. - Yeah, my mother, their mothers, ask any of these guys, and they'll tell you everything! They're not all rich and perfect! You've got a real mature attitude, Wendy, and I'm sorry, but around here, that bullshit doesn't fly. You have no idea what reality is. This is reality. - This is your reality. I understand what you're saying, Peter, but, I just think that, just because they might not have had the best families, or whatever, that they're getting old enough to at least parent themselves, so they don't end up living in some dirty cave in an amusement park. I mean, there are places that you can go for help, for a safe place to stay, that's safer than this! I mean, this is pretend, Peter. This is just pretend! You can't pretend! - Then don't pretend to be my fuckin' mother! - (scoffing) I just wanted to help. Come on, you guys, let's go. - We don't want you to go. - You guys, you know that if you wanna come with me, you can stay at my house for a few days. I can help you find places to stay, and get help and stuff. I mean, if you want, if you're tired of all this. - Can we go, Peter? - I'm not in charge o' you guys. You can do whatever the fuck you want! You can go, I don't give a shit. - I wanna go. - Can I take a shower at your house? - We have real food, and it's clean. - At our house, we have video games, and you don't have to pay for 'em. - Right on! - You wanna go? - Come on, Peter! - Peter, come with us. - No. - Why not? - I just wanna stay here, and I always wanna be a kid, and have fun, ya know, you can't do that when, you know, you guys go. You can do all that outreach shelter bullshit, I've done that shit before, I know exactly what she's talkin' about! They have you clean up your act for about a year. Workin' at the fast food place, or painting houses, or whatever bullshit they have you do for not even enough money to survive! I'm just gonna stay here and have a good time. So you guys go, have a blast. (door slamming) (soft music) ♫ Add up your winnings ♫ See what you've got ♫ Lucky situation ♫ You think that you're hot ♫ But your star is falling fast ♫ Down to this corner ♫ I remember this feeling ♫ Bitter taste in my mouth ♫ I remember saying ♫ I'd never let it leak out ♫ I remember this feeling ♫ Can't believe it's returned ♫ Shiver down my back ♫ Livin' with the burn ♫ Go won't you leave me alone ♫ Go won't you leave me alone ♫ Go won't you leave me alone ♫ Go won't you leave me alone (soft music) (ominous music) - How quiet it is down here. Up above, the children spin on the teacups and bump each other in the bumper cars, but down here, nothing sounds alive. Now is the hour when most children will be leaving, off to their homes, where they'll sleep in their beds, their lips stained with toothpaste. Their eyes, closed to the horrors and pleasures that await them tomorrow morning. Compare them with the boys down here, all sullen and desperate for just one more hit of the pipe! None of these boys know love. None of these boys love me. They despise me. They all despise me, and they love Peter Pan! The youth, the beauty, the boundless energy, the leader. And I'm just some old janitor to them. A curiosity that can't even attract the curious. A joke, that's been told too many times in their little hideaway. But, Peter Pan, even as you mock me today, you will undoubtedly become me tomorrow. (squeaking) Are all the prisoners chained so that they can't fly away? - They are. (chains rattling) (ominous music) (chains rattling) (ominous music) - So, now then, boys, and lady, are you ready for some fun? A little game, perhaps? Where the tables are turned, and I get to ruin your pathetic lives for the night. - What about their parents? - What parents? These children have no parents, no one cares if they live or die, no one cares what happens to them! - The girl, the new one, maybe they have someone lookin' out for them? - They look like all the rest to me. - Aye, sir. (ominous music) - I could use a couple cabin boys tonight. (rattling) Which of you is it to be? Anyone wanna be a pirate? - You see, sir, I don't think my mother, Wendy would want me to be a pirate. - Stow the gab, boy. You, boy, you look as if you still had a little pluck left in you. Did you ever wanna be a pirate, me hearty? - Did you mean a sailing the seven seas pirate, or more of a janitor pirate in Neverland, like you? - That seals your doom. Smee, run upstairs and fetch the toys! Run! (intense music) (stomping) - Where are they? - They're gone. - They just left? - They took 'em. - What? - Hook and the pirates, they took 'em all. - Wendy, too? - I thought they'd just kick 'em out, ya know, I didn't think they'd actually-- - Oh, shit. - I told them where we were. I looked on the blueprint, and I went to the crawlspace to Hook's dungeon and I told them everything. Don't go. - You blew it, Tink, all right? That guy's insane, he's a fuckin' freak! - So I made a fucking mistake, big deal. We both made a lot of fucking mistakes, so what? We're always making mistakes. - You got that right. - It won't matter anymore, anyway. I'll be dead soon, anyway. - Come on, with the drama, already. - It's not drama, Peter, it's real. (giggling) I drank it all. (laughing) I took all the fairy dust, too. (chuckling) - You did not. - Wanna bet? - Damn it, what is the matter with you? Why do we have to be so fuckin' selfish? - What do you care, you won't have to worry about me bothering you. - You want me to buy into this shit? Just get your act together! - You really don't care. - Of course I do, but right now you can't be the center of attention, okay? - I could get better, you could save me. - I can barely hear you. - I could get well again, if only you believed. If only you believed in me. You got so serious when she came around. It's not like you, getting so serious about things, and now you're so worried, you never worried about me that way. - I just wanna make sure they're okay. - You wanna make sure you're okay. You're thinking about Neverland, and you're thinking about growing up and just leaving our life together. - It's not our life together. Wendy was talkin' to me, and she's got a point. Maybe this is all bullshit! Maybe it's time for me to grow up. - Oh, no, and stop believing in fairies? - What's gonna happen to me, Tink? - (chuckling) I'm dying, and all you can think about is what's gonna happen to you. Peter, you're young, just enjoy your youth, I mean, that girl, she's got money, she's got a family, she has a future, but what do we have? - None o' that. - Yeah, but we have something they don't have, those people with their stupid, stupid responsibilities, we have something better. - And what's that? - We believe in fairies. (soft music box music) Do you believe in fairies, Peter? If you believe, just clap your hands. (soft music box music) Don't let me die. (soft music box music) (door slamming) - Are we to die? - From pleasure! Never was there luck on a pirate ship with a woman aboard. There's no one who will save you, now, Missy. - [Peter] There is one. - Who said that? (intense music) (pulsating) So, finally, I've got you. You've led the new girl and these boys to run amok in the park, trashing the place with your litter, harassing innocent guests, stinking up Neverland with your clove cigarettes. And all the while, laughing at me and my men. So, this is your doing. - It's all my doing. - Proud and insolent youth. Prepare to meet thy doom. (intense music) (pulsating) Peter Pan, who and what art thou? Are you youth, are you joy, are you freedom? Are you that little bird that has broken out of the egg? (clicking) (thrusting) (gasping) (blood dripping) (intense music) (car revving and peeling out) (distorted revving) (distorted wind blowing) (bright music) (dog barking) - Aw, shit! - Ow! (indistinct chattering) - Whoo! (indistinct chattering) (heart beating) (intense music) - We made it, brother. - Whoo, hell yeah! It's so crazy! - Oh my God! (chuckling) - Who's the man, who's the man? - We da man, we da man. - Whoo! (indistinct chattering) (heart beating) (ethereal music) (clacking) - Ahh! (chuckling) (playing discordant piano music) (playing discordant piano music) (ethereal music) (heart beating) - Mmm. (Baby laughing) (grunting playfully) (dog barking) (ethereal music) (door squeaking) - You wanna come in? Come in, I'll make you somethin' to eat. - Would I have to go to school? - Huh? - If I come in and be who you want me to be, would I have to go to school? - I don't wanna change you, I wanna help you. - You wanna help me change. - Yeah. - Well, if I do what you want me to do, would I have to go to school? - Maybe, probably, eventually. - And get a boring job. - You could have a career, some people really like what they do. - Soon, I'd be a man, I'd be just like everyone else. - You'd still be special. - I just don't wanna go to school. I don't wanna learn about algebra and stupid crap that doesn't count for anything. I don't wanna get bald, and get old and grow a beard, and all that. - I think you'd look really good in a beard. - But I don't want that. That'd be like giving up. They'll be looking for you. I don't care. So what, you're just gonna go back to Neverland and live in that little hole, alone? - I'll live with-- - Who? - I'll live with the fairies, and we'll live up high in the trees, and-- - Peter, there are no fairies! - There's always fairies, there's young ones! Because when the first baby laughed for the very first time, Their laugh broke into like a million little pieces, that was the beginning of fairies, and the blue ones are boys, and the pink ones are girls-- - Peter, please don't give up. - Wait, maybe you could come with me, I was hoping you could come with me. - Is that why you waited here this long, you thought I was gonna fly away with you again? - Why not? - Hey, boy, why're you crying? - My name's Peter Pan. - Yeah, I know. - I just came to get my mother to take-- - You really do need a mother, you know. Peter, maybe there'll be another girl, someone who's younger than me. I really wish I could go with you. - Yeah, I guess you can't. I guess you're just an asshole, like everyone else. (laughing) - Peter, your laugh is infectious. And if I didn't really know you, I might start laughing, too. But you know the shame of the whole thing is that you're real, you're not some character in a fairy tale, and you're not some idealization of everlasting youth, you're just a guy who will never, ever grow up! You're like a boy that girls like when they're teenagers, or a man who can't even tie his own tie. You're just a guy who's too weak or too lazy to get his life together when someone is standing right in front of them that can help, but I'm not gonna help. I'm not gonna be your mother, and I'm not gonna build a little nest for you and watch you fly away, because I can't. I'm just too old for that sort of thing. (door slamming) (stomping) - Yeah, I guess you're just too grown up, Wendy. - [Wendy] If you close your eyes, and you're lucky enough, you'll see a shapeless pool of lovely, pale colors, hanging in the darkness, and if you squeeze them tighter, the pool will begin to take shape and the colors will become so vivid, that with another squeeze, they must catch on fire. But just before they catch on fire, just before they do, you'll see it, you'll see a pirate, and an Indian, and a fairy, and the boy who refused to grow up. A boy for whom every moment that passes feels like a long time ago, and when you look at him long enough, you might see his hair becoming white, or you might notice that that youthful light in his eye is only just a light from a carousel. And the light from the carousel is only just a light hanging in the darkness somewhere in a story, a story about a place you believed in a long time ago, when you were young and happy, and heartless.
