Kudzu! Goddamn kudzu! You know, we can't get rid of that stuff. Nothin' known to man will stop it. poisons, pesticides ... They even tried flamethrowers. Now it's nerve gas. Can you believe that? It's movin' north, you know inch by inch, day by day. One day it's gonna reach New York. Thank you for the ride, sir. Peper's store is about 10 miles. You can not miss it. I'm looking for Martha Travis? Well... I can't help you there. There's no one by that name in these parts. She was seen in your store. Maybe you might recognize her. Well, that's Emily Bowen. She hasn't been in here in years. Not one for company, and she don't like intruders. You want to talk to her? - I do. You're outta luck, fella. Emily can't speak to nobody. Go down the road about 3Â½ miles then take a right at the first corner. I'll be damned. Your eyes, Martha ... they look like they seen too much. Don't you remember me? Gary Wallace, the Oakville Bee. I interviewed you, with your father, before you disappeared. 10 years I've been trackin' you down. Old fella at the store says, you haven't spoken since you came here. Folks round here think you're dumb, but I know you're not. I won't be leavin' here until you tell me what happened ... that night your father was murdered. Breakfast! - Are we running late? What time do you have? - Ten after seven. Six. You're just one hour ahead. - Ahead? Breakfast? - No. Breakfast? I just had it. Medicinal. - For your liver? More metaphysical than that. For my soul. Where the hell is Eunice? - Hi! Did you have breakfast, Daddy? - Yes. Well I see the developers finally got to Oakville, Eunice. Surely did, Mr Travis. They are ripping our heart out. Worse! It's a lobotomy. Gobbling up your past ... like a plague of locusts. A national lobotomy. We'll do this alone, Eunice, okay? It's a private moment, you understand? We won't be long. - Alright, Mr Travis. Alright, let's hear it, baby. It's beautiful over there on the other side. Soft colors pervade everywhere, it's like being at the end of a rainbow. Fresh flowers adorn the vast halls of the hereafter, and the smells are fragrant and sweet. There's no violence over there, and no work. All... people... all animals are made whole again, complete. All earthly injuries are healed, all diseases cured ... That's enough! It won't happen again, will it? Never. - Promise? I promise. Travis. - Good day, Mr Travis. Will that be two rooms? - Certainly it will. Two rooms were reserved, weren't they? - They were, sir, I was merely ... You're new here, aren't you? 20 years, I've been coming to this hotel. And never before has anybody ever, ever suggested ... Alright, Daddy! Rooms 11 and 14. How will you be paying for that? Like always, with cash. - Would you care to leave a deposit? No! I'm going upstairs to rest. I hope you weren't offended. - No. Would you like help with your bags? - Are you coming, Martha? It's alright, I'm used to it. Mr Fallon, there's been some speculation that ... you won't be running for the mayor's office next year. Would you like to comment? Just like that, not too long. Okay? Now, just a minute. Come on. There's a call on the line, Mr Silas. Yeah? Where's he coming from? Why is it always Chicago? For members only! Daddy? Daddy? - Yes? What is it? 6 o'clock, time to go. Are you crazy, girl? It's only 4. Oh, you sure? - What're you trying to do to me, sugar? Your daddy needs his sleep. - This watch! I'll buy you a new one. - That's not the point. I set it right this morning. It's already gained two hours. Maybe you dreamt it. - I did not! Some people can't wear watches. Well, I can. You know I can. - Of course, you can, sugar. Now you get some rest. You need your rest. I'll call you in a couple hours. It is beautiful over there. Soft colors pervade everywhere it's like being at the end of a rainbow. Fresh flowers adorn the vast halls of the hereafter. And the smells are fragrant and sweet. There's no violence over there and no work. Everybody's taken care of. Every person, every animal has been made whole again, complete. All earthly injuries, all diseases are healed. It's not too clear. It's ... I am trying to tune somebody in. Yes? Yes? Is there somebody that knows a little Johnny? Yes. Who are they? Stand up. Don't be shy. You know a little Johnny who's passed over? Yes. - What's your name? Rachel Sachs. - Come to the microphone, Rachel. Don't be nervous. Remember, I'm only God's instrument, a telephone exchange for those spirits who want to connect with their folks ... here on earth. Sometimes the connection's not too good. Sometimes the signals are weak. I've lost a Johnny. A little Johnny? A baby Johnny? Yes, his voice is very small. Was it little Johnny's birthday? Yesterday! He's about 3 now? - Yes, it will be. Yes, I can see him. He's got black hair. Brown. - Dark brown, almost black. Yes, he's right here. He's looking at the flowers. Yes, you can, Johnny, darling boy. He said can I pick some flowers for my mom? Oh, he's not my baby! Yes, but you know his mother. I didn't say the flowers are for you. He's a handsome boy now, over there spirit side. Did he have a defect? - Yes ... in his heart. I feel it, I ... But he's all healed now and he's... he's very happy. Another voice is coming through. Tom? He's hard to understand. He has his accent. Makes him hard to understand. It's Tomp or ... Tom! Does anyone know a Tom? - Me! Your name? Mary Kuron. Yes, Tom? I can't quite hear ... Could you speak slower, Tom? His voice, it's his accent ... He's Irish. He's holding his hands out. Big hands, grained. A working man's hands. He worked at the Silas chemical plant. He says, "Do not worry, Mary." He's alright. What's he doing with hisself over there? He says, "I'm doing great over here." He's very happy. Not saying the worstest, is he? Been doing some moonshine? No, you can be sure he isn't doing that. He says, "What's got into you, Mary? You know I was never one ... for gambling or hooch. " My pappy never was strong with the truth. He says he learned to play the guitar. Did he want to play the guitar? No, you've gotten it wrong, Martha. It's my husband that's crazy to play the guitar. You've gotten it real wrong this time. He's still alive! No he's not. He was watching TV when I left home tonight! Only an hour ago. I thought it was my daddy you was talkin' to. Is you daddy's name Tom? - Yes. Tom Murphy! And my husband is Tom Kuron. But it's my daddy that's dead. It's not your daddy talkin' to me, Mary. Did he die violently? - No! This man did. I can feel the impact. His chest is exploded. Blood and bone on the wall ... like wallpaper. Do you have a white carpet? - Yes. It was laid last week. - I'll tell her, Tom. How do you know? - He says: "Do not worry about a thing, Mary." His chest is healed. His ribs are back in place. - But Tom's not dead! I can hear him. I can hear him playing his guitar. He's very happy over there, Mary. There's another man with him. I can see him quite clearly. Brown hair, smiling. What's his name, Tom? You don't know his name? I know it though. I can see his house in Chicago. His wife, waving. Martha, for God's sake. Something ... Something ... dangling in his hand. It's a gun. - No. Black gloves. Black gloves .... Black gun. - No! No! No! You wait here. Martha will explain. What the hell are you doing out there? What's up with you? What's got into you? - I don't know. You wouldn't let it go, would ya. How many times have I told you ... when you're following a wrong one, let go. But no, no ... your arrogance has to have its way. It was not a wrong one. I saw it ... all of it. - You saw it? You saw nothing. Nothing! I know, remember. I know. That's what you said to Mama. - Your mother saw nothing. You don't still believe that cock-and-bull story, do ya? You were with me in St Louis, remember, hundreds of miles away. You couldn't have appeared to her. You know your mother's problem? Religion. Too much religion. But she never did see you ... like she said, baby. It was all in her dreams. Now ... You must apologize to that poor woman. I have her waiting outside. - I'm not apologizing. You will. - No, I can't! I saw it! I saw it, all of it! You heard what the woman said. Her husband isn't dead. She's wrong. - You heard what she said. He's at home watching TV. In some households, that's considered ... being alive. Now, now ... you must apologize, sweetheart. You frightened the life out of her. - What about me, Daddy? Why should you be frightened? You been doing this since you were a kid. It was different this time. You have to believe me. All right, we'll talk about it on the train. Right now, apologize. Oh, look, we have to keep them sweet. You may wanna come back. Only a few more years, you know, that's all. Then we can retire to the land of milk and honey. One more time, sweetheart. She knew about the carpet. Weird, that was. The new wallpaper, she knew about that. Coffee? Yes. She said my chest did whaat? Exploded. Blood and bones all over the carpet? Right. That's disgusting. People like that shouldn't be allowed ... No. No. Tom? Can we get some shots inside, Lieutenant? - If you wanna make your viewers throw up, be my guest. - Thank you. Can you confirm that Kuron worked at Silas Chemical? - Where else is there to work? What did he do there? - Plant maintenance. Is there a Ms Kuron? - Yeah, Mary Kuron. She was in the kitchen when it happened. Didn't see anything. Can we talk to her? Sorry, she's sedated. At the county medical center. I didn't see an ambulance. We got here with you guys. Listen kid, when I say she's sedated, that's what she is. OK? Say hi to your mother, Gary. She's dead, Irving. Oh shit. I saw Amy just last month at the state fair. She's been gone near two years. - How'd I miss that? Sorry abou that, Gary. I could swear it was her. Yes? - Gary Wallace, Oakville Bee. Can I ask you some questions? You said you wouldn't, Jack. - He's not gonna use our names, will ya? Not if you don't want me to. - See? You know the Kurons? - Yeah. She's Mary's best friend. Now, Jack. - I work out at Silas where Tom did. Any idea of a motive? All I'll say is this: Safety & Health Administration was about to start ... an audit of the Oakville plant. - Did he have something to tell them? That's all I got to say. Tom Kuron worked in maintenance, didn't he? He was gonna blow the whistle on them, wasn't he? About health safety violations. I gotcha, well. Thanks for the tip. - That's not all! Don'tcha tell on her, Jack! - Eva, I've got to. Mary knows who did it. - She doesn't, you dumb idiot, she doesn't! Eva was out with her sometime tonight. They went to see some freaky medium. What happened? - Don't, Jack! Please don't! Something terrible will happen. - Nothing's going to happen. Don't be scared, girl. You won't get mixed up in it. Hey now. Thank you, Shelley. Like to fuck her, Irving? - I am a married man, sir. I always knew you were a liar, but not a hypocrite. You know what she does for me, Irving? - Always reckoned ... that was your affair, Mr Silas. - Well. Lemme tell you, Irving. When I decided, not only did I own chemical plants, I lived in one. I decided to record exactly what goes into me ... and what comes out the other end. Shelley is now taking ... my urine and stool from last night to be analyzed. Isn't that interesting? - Certainly is. You're full of shit, Irving. Which brings me to your hysterical call. I thought you should know. - Are you being serious? I am, sir. - Kuron's wife gonna give me trouble? No. It's the medium could cause you a problem, Mr Silas. She knows what he looks like. She even knows his name. Where is she now? On the train to Ironsboro. She has another show there tonight. So she doesn't even know what happened. But Gary Wallace does. The Bee's running with the story. I'll have to interview her. - Tread water for a while. Enough for you to contact your man? He may not take fortune tellers seriously. Well, that's his business. But she sure as shit predicted Tom Kuron's death. Reckon Health & Safety wanna look at all your other plants too ... Wouldn't think prison shit much worth analyzing myself, Ted. Especially when 3,000 volts been passed through it. I'll seek guidance from the Lord. I'd telephone him right away, if I were you. Do you read the Good Book every day, sir? - Every day. I smell a preacher. Is that the profession you follow? It is. - So, uh, for you, this is work. A salesman's manual. More a source of inspiration. - But also ... a source of income. You can't deny it. I don't. Tell me, preacher, what brings you on this journey? I've been called to a new flock. - Flock? Ironic, isn't it? The word applies to both sheep and Christians. Indeed, it does. Our Lord is our Shepherd. He teaches us ... humility. - That's a word I don't trust. The reason I'm pursuing the subject, preacher, is that you and my daughter Martha ... have something in common. She too is interested ... in spiritual matters. Martha is a medium. - Lay off me, Walter. Only Martha has a distinct advantage over you, in the spirit state, so to speak. Does she? - Sure. You preacher can only tell your flock what is written down in the Bible ... the word. Martha, on the other hand, is like television. She has a direct line to the dead that transmits pictures to her. She can offer proof that there is life after death. Why, she can even describe what it's like over there. Halls of music, of literature. Pizza parlors. Hamburger hamlets ... visuals. Isn't that right, Martha? - Ignore him, Reverend. He's just mad at me. - I see. But you are a medium. - Sure. I find that very interesting. Do you also have the power of prophecy? Funny you should ask that. - No. I can't foretell the future. Be grateful. - Why do you say that, preacher? That's dangerous territory. We steal if we touch tomorrow. It is God's. Do you really think she knows who did it? If she does, she kept it from Kuron's widow. All she did was apologize. It had all been a terrible mistake. - But it wasn't a mistake , was it. Kuron died exactly as she predicted. How do you account for that? If she's tradin' in futures ... has to an insider deal with God? - You're kinda cynical, Gary. I am when it comes to supernatural shit like this, Jeff. Can't deny it. - You don't believe in God? It's the way my mommy and daddy brought me up. So any concept of a soul or life after death is just bullshit? You ask Weinberg if he's going to question her? - Yep. He laughed at me. Did he now? - Said he wasn't going to look ... a goddamn asshole interviewin' a two-bit medium. What time's the two-bit medium arrive in Ironsboro? Jeff, Burne will kill me if I don't come home. It's bowling night. - Frank, we have to get Gary ... over to Ironsboro in two hours. - Jeff, get somebody else ... to cover it, will ya? Like you said, I think it's all bullshit. That's what makes you so right for this assignment, Gary. Your qualifications are impeccable. - What? You're an agnostic and an asshole. Train arrives on track B. Clear the platform. Ironsboro Station. Ironsboro Station. Let's go get her. We're here. Wake up. Feelin' alright? Maybe it's something you ate. I'd delay getting off if I were you. - Who the hell are you? Mr Travis, I don't want to startle you, but I wouldn't get off just yet, sir. There's two cops out there waiting to interrogate your daughter. What? - I repeat, who are ... Gary Wallace, reporter with the Oakville Bee. You obviously didn't see our headline this morning. What's that go to do with my daughter? - She predicted it would happen. My daughter, sir, is a renowned medium ... not some cheap fortune teller. - Daddy, you know ... Say not a word, Martha. Not a word in front of the gutter press. Alright, sir. Now, show me these cops. These aren't cops. I can smell cops like I can smell Lindberger cheese. Those are funeral directors. - Trust me, sir. I'm being serious. So am I. I tell you, they're funeral directors. - You don't seem to understand, sir. It's possible to that your daughter is in real danger. Look! What did I tell you? Common undertakers. Your story, sir, is as dead as the occupant of that box. Kindly leave us in peace. All aboard! What's the population of the world, Pops? The population of the world is ... too many. Ask your mother, she's the teacher. - 3 billion plus. That's 3,000 million? - That's right. How many's "too many", Pops? - Too many is 1, 2, 3 and 4. What's the population of America? - Too many, son, too many. I asked you not to call me here. I don't care what the reason is. - Is Daddy going away again, Mommy? No one knows. - He's only just got back. What does Daddy do, Mom? - He works for the CIA. Wrong, dumdum. He runs a security company. What's that? - What? You want me to do this job for nothing because some dumb bitch has visions? Well then, you finish the job yourself, shithead. Damn! What's up, honey? - Oh, some idiot client trying to get... something for nothing. Yeah ... What does security mean, Pops? Well, security means having enough food and clothing for you and Cindy ... and Larry and Mike ... and for Mommy. What car are you taking today, dear? - The Mercedes? Are you going out? - I may have to. Which room is Mr Travis in? - The house telephone is over there, sir. No, I need his room number. It's a surprise. Walter's an old friend. Yes, could I please speak to Lieutenant Irving Weinberg? Just a minute. - I'll wait. I'm putting you through. God chose Martha ... to be a link with loved ones on the other side. A spiritual telephone exchange. Now, presumably, there can be interference, maybe even crossed lines? - Exactly. Is that what happened with Mary Kuron last night? Nah, that's other quite certain. You have to realize in a young girl such powers bring with them ... a fertile imagination and the nervous disposition ... of a racehorse. Daddy, I know you're awake. Stop giving me a hard time. Please. I need to talk to you. It's no good saying it's all in my dreams. You keep on with that, I'll go crazy like Mama. Why won't you open up? I have to talk to somebody. I'm going for some air, okay? Must be a strange life, always on the road, just the two of you. It isn't a life, Gary. It's a calling. This precious gift bestowed upon Martha has a price. Loneliness. You were telling me about her mother? She left us when Martha was but 12. Does Martha have any friends? - Only in the spirit world. Flight 18, sir. The name's Davidson. There's a prepaid return to Ironsboro, first class. There's a booking for you, but it's not first class. First class is fully booked. You got the last seat in coach. There is a delay, I'm afraid, Mr Davidson. How long? - We're not sure. The equipment hasn't arrived yet. - What equipment? The aircraft, sir. - Why don't you just say that? The aircraft is just goddamn late, in plain English. Do you have a club? - Are you a member? No. - I'm sorry, first class ... and members only. Gate 18. Martha? - Shhh. What is it? - Shhh. You could've woken Daddy. Don't worry about your daddy. He and I have been drinking all afternoon. Drinking? Daddy doesn't usually drink. And you don't usually have strange men in your room. Are you strange? - Not strange. Just married. Can we talk? - Now? I have to bathe for the show. Hot water puts me ... in the right mood. The spirits must like me clean or something. Can you believe that? - Sorry. I got a problem with all that spirit stuff. - You never seen me work. Oh, you can probably pick up people's thoughts. Like in telepathy, that's possible. But that's all. Your daddy says you got a fertile imagination. I think he's probably right. So you think I'm a charlatan. - If you wish to put it that way. Hey, the light is not on. Certainly not the green one. Is this your idea of a deep and lasting relationship? That's right. This way men lie with me and not to me. Hello, Eunice, this is Walter Travis. - Hi, Mr Travis, what can I do for you? I need a little ... favor? What's that? - There's a young reporter ... on the Oakville Bee. - My sister's workin' there ... I'm going to their Christmas party. Then you probably know him. Gary Wallace? Yeah I do! I need to know who killed Kuron? My job depends on it, Martha. I'm a charlatan, right? Cheap performer? Fraud? Stage act? No one's gonna believe me or you! It's as if it never happened. Get out of here. Now! Ladies and gentlemen, would you please give ... a very, very warm welcome ... to Martha Travis, the courier to your loved ones. Thank you! How many of you have not seen me before? Did you expect me to float in? Well, I'm not into levitation, not tonight anyway. Did you expect me to have a radio antenna like R2-D2? I'm just a normal person, the woman next door. So don't be afraid, alright? We're gonna chew the fat for a while until the voices start coming. While we're waiting, does anybody have any questions to ask me? When we cross over to the spirit world, do we still have to work? Oh no, we achieve spiritual rest. We relax. There's no more striving to keep your head above water. No more cutthroat deals to make. No more keeping up with the mortgage payments. No more competing. So does that mean Heaven is like a communist country? If you donate a part of your body and when you die ... it's removed, does it affect you when you enter the spirit world? I hope not, I carry a kidney card. Is the concept of time the same as we understand it here? Time is only a human concept, something to make things ... real for us. It's not too clear. I'm trying to tune in. Some days the signals are stronger than others that ... In the third row, is there someone who knows anyone named Buttler? I do. Don't be afraid. What's your name? My late sister-in-law's name is ... Buttler ... was Buttler. Who is Susan? - That's her. Susan Butler. - Who's Jackie? - Me! I'm Jackie Adams. One moment. I can hear you fine, Susan. Just be patient. She's very excited. Susan wants to know have you done any redecorating in your house recently. I just painted my kitchen. I just painted it last week. She says you got in an awful mess. Paint everywhere. I did. - Susan says stick to cooking. Who's Bill? - My husband. Susan says she's seen him. - No. She says he's alright now. His face... blown completely away in some sort of explosion. His face? No! She says he's alright now. He keeps looking in the mirror, admiring himself. His face is complete again. She says Bill was always vain. - But ... but he's dead? In row 8, the lady in red, know anyone name of ... Louis? - Yeah, that's my brother. Who's Jimmy? - My older brothers. They were twins. - It's alright. They're together again. - They can't be. Jimmy isn't dead. Nobody can tell who's Jimmy and who's Louis. They're having so much fun over there. Jimmy isn't dead! You're wrong! He can't be over there! Bill Prior. Is there a Bill Prior? Yes, he's my son. Is he alive? - Yes. Mike Braddon? Is there a Mike Braddon? Me ... I'm Mike Braddon. - What's your job, Mike? I'm a union official. - You ... Carl Zwimmer? Is there a Carl Zwimmer? Carl's a friend of mine. He's meeting me later. Sometimes this happens. The voices stop. The dead withdraw. It is as if they become so disgusted with what we're doing. They can't speak to us anymore. Tonight they have turned their backs on us. I'm sorry. If bring your tickets with you tomorrow, You'll be allowed in free. God bless you. Why is he in here? - Look at me, baby. What's going on in there? What kinda nightmare keeps exploding in your mind? Why won't you believe me, Daddy? Try to describe what you see, Martha. Stay away from me. Only vultures like the dead. He sits on Kuron's corpse,waiting. I'm only trying to help, Walter. - Listen to what he's got to say. What he's got. Just forget that I'm a reporter. - After this afternoon? Get him out, Walter. Get that fucking hack out of here. What happened this afternoon? Nothing. - He was with me. See you, Walter. I'm not family. Thankfully. While we're talking ethics, Martha, I think you're act is a scam. That's a story I intend to file tomorrow. Put that away, Walter. I want your clearheaded, like you used to be, before Mama left. We're at the end of the road. I cant go on. - We've got to. Why have we? Is there something you're not telling me? Something that I ought to know? The bank deposit's alright, isn't it? The shares and everything? My God. You lost it all, haven't you? Where is it? Are you gambling again? Is it a woman this time? Who is she? Huh? What's her name? My money! You bastard! You've cheated me all my life. You've cheated me all my life. Son of a bitch. You're laughing at me. - I can't help it. I can't? Here, look in the mirror. See your mother's face. Swollen with tears. You stupid, mean bitch who walked out on me. And now you are the same sweet smelling garbage, you and your mother, Lynette! Even her name sounds like a cake decoration. Oh. This is the real spirit world. Help me! Dear God, help me. I can't stop. I can't go on. Of course, you can. You can go on. Yes, tomorrow ... tomorrow will be different. Tonight, there you simply broke the rules, that's all. It wasn't grand. It wasn't ... show business. I'm still at the airport. Better tell your cop friend ... to keep treading water. Relax, I'll be there tomorrow. I'm sorry to bring you in on a Sunday, Chief, but I thought you should see that. Get me Gary. This is fine. Wait here. Stand clear of the area! Excuse me. Excuse me, please? Excuse me, please? Evacuate the area! Evacuate the area immediately! Excuse me, but are you Jackie Adams? Yes. - Did I see you last night ... at the Washington Hall when Martha Travis was working? Is your husband in there? Injured? Don't know. Waiting to find out. Maybe she was right. Maybe Bill is dead ... I hope not. - So do I. I said such terrible things. - Forget it. What I meant when I said "It's not a show business" ... What did you mean? It wasn't entertainment any longer. Why does everything serious have to be turned into entertainment? Politics, wars, famines, space shuttles. They're all just variety acts on TV. I'm not a variety act, Walter. - What do you want? There was an accident, at a local nuclear fuel plant. Bill Adams, Jimmy Dupont, Bill Prior, Mike Braddon, Carl Zwimmer... all dead. Don't pay any attention to him. - It's true, Martha. I take back everything I said last night. You hearing this, Daddy? - I can't take it. I'm sorry. That's not good enough. When I go on stage each night, I look at the audiences ... and feel their pain. I see their mangled bodies, their faces drained of blood. Dead! That's not show business, Daddy. I don't see over there at the end of the rainbow any longer. Instead, I see wasting diseases, cancers ... symptoms of our own self-destruction. It haunts me, and it's getting worse. We don't understand what we're doing. That's the story you should be after, but it isn't, is it? Have you phoned your editor yet? Is my job. Sorry, but tomorrow this place will be like a hornet's nest. They're gonna turn me into a variety act, Daddy. Isn't that what you wanted? I could keep 'em off your back, Martha. You give me the name of Kuron's killer, and the story's dead. Martha! Martha! Oh God, to whom vengeance belongeth! Show thyself! Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth! Render a reward to the proud. Lord, how long shall the wicked triumph? Good morning, Irving. You know I don't like doing business so close to the Lord's house. It just so happens I've come to talk about a crucifixion. Mine. Have you read this? Never did take the Bee. - Well, maybe you should, Ted. The Lord didn't spend all his time up the mountain, did he? All buzz, no sting. You think that because you're a dumb arrogant WASP. Well, as the only Jew in the area, I know where the nails are going. And the crown of thorns and the vinegar. No sting, huh? They're asking why I haven't questioned her yet ... plus they don't actually come out with it, implying negligence ... if not possible corruption. And you don't come out smelling of ammonia. You know, Irving, I don't believe we're in the Garden of Gethsemane yet. I can't tread water any longer. I have to go after her. Just pray your man gets there before me. Wallace. - She was right on the button. He exists alright. - Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Hold on. There is one flight a day from Chicago to Ironsboro. Uh huh. - Yesterday was delayed then canceled. It took off at 8 o'clock this morning. Arrives at 11:37 local time. His name was not on the passenger list, but I wouldn't expect it to be. I suggest you take Ms Travis to the airport. Then litmus test is whether she can recognize him. - I'll do it right away. Hope to see you next in church next Sunday. Come on, Walter. Open up, it's urgent. Walter, where's Martha? She's not in her room. - A day of wrath ... and a day of despair and anguish! A day of the ruinous devastation ... Where is Martha, Walter? - A day of thunders and gloom. A day of trumpet blast and battle cry. You foul and slimy creature. Slithered into my confidence. - Walter. I took you in just to lay hands on my little girl? Listen to me, Walter. Where is she? Walter! Fearful is the day ... because they have sinned against the Lord! Today is the day of salvation. Your blood shall be poured out as dust ... and your flesh as dung. Let the rescue services have a clear passage. Witch! You bloody witch! Have you come to see your prophecy fulfilled? Have you come to tell me that Billy's alright? Alright in there? Alright up there? Answer me, witch! You know, if we didn't believe in all that crap about the hereafter, maybe we'd pay some attention to what is going on down here. We only get one shot, don't we? And that's the truth. So tell me, what is my son is doing over there? Picking flowers? Playing the guitar? I'm sorry. - Sorry? You're sorry? You get the hell outta here! You'll not stay here and gloat over us. Hey, what are you doing, buddy? - I'm here to meet Martha Travis. Nobody told me. She's been and gone already. Maybe you better wait out front, mister. Maybe she's meant me to meet her at her hotel. Who are you, anyway? - Her brother. Just in from New York. Do you know where she's staying? Are you giving me the runaround, kid? This is their third goddamn time. Well what about Mr Travis? - Irv, there's someone to see you. They fucking better, kid! You son of a bitch. - I come in peace. Martha Travis is missing. She hasn't been seen since late this morning. That's great. I'll be gettin' on home then. Not so fast, my friend. Kuron's killer's in town. You may have another murder on your hands? - You can forget all that shit ... about the hitman? - No, I can't. I have his name. Am I expected to believe all this hocus pocus voodoo crap? Irving, you're only on page 1. You haven't heard what happened last night. Is Martha back yet? - No. Shit! Where the hell is she? There's a message for you. Call your editor. Excuse me. You have a reservation for me? Davidson. - Hold on, be with you in a moment. Yes, Mr Davidson, a single room, reserved for one night. Okay up here, Chief. Want me to stay put? Yeah. We'll close off the balcony, okay? You think she'll turn up? - If she does, will you let her go on? - Sure I will. But if I let her go on, will she want to? - Just leave her to me. The trap is set. Period. But will the bait turn up. Question mark. She left her ... Hold on, hold on, here she is. Martha! I have to change. - It's important, for Godsake. God's sake? - Yours. That's better. Make it fast. Tom Kuron's killer is here ... in town. Where's Walter? - In the hotel. Couldn't wake him. - Drunk? Sorry he won't be here tonight. I could've told him why we turn everything into entertainment. So obvious. It's the only way we can make sense of the random stupidity of it all. Martha. You could be killed out there tonight. Good. Good evening everyone. - Good evening. I look at your faces, hungry for confirmation, and could weep. There you are, wanting, waiting ... expecting me to provide something concrete to believe in. You'd hate me if I told you that when we die ... we return to nothing. To the exact state we were in ... before we were born. You'd hate me, wouldn't you? Yes. But if you knew for certain that there was nothing after death ... that you only had one shot, as someone said to me this morning. Maybe if we didn't indulge in the arrogance of thinking ... we'd go on forever, we'd be better people while we were alive. Think of that. But you don't want to think about that, do you? No. Nor shall you. That would mean my act was a fraud, wouldn't it? But you know it isn't, don't you? That's it. You're rational, questioning people ... You're not like the others tonight sitting in front of the television ... being told what to believe in. No one pulls one over you, do they? In the 4th row. Is there somebody who knows the name ... Kirstle? Me, yes. Don't be nervous. Is his name Art? - Yes. He's only just gone over, hasn't he? He had a hard life. - He was a coalminer. Art says, "It's good to be out in the light, at last." "All those years in the dark." "No more bosses. No more work." "All these years in the dark. " Was his neck broken? He was on a motorcycle. Yes. He said he was on his way home, but never got there. Never got to see his mom again. Who's Tony? Who's John? Does it mean anything to you? - No. Who's Walt? Not so fast, Walt, there's a lot of interference. I can't hear you properly. Who's... Walt? Does anyone know Walt? I know a Walter. My husband was Walt. He's on the other side. No. He says he's somebody's father. Does anybody have a father named Walt? Over here! My father was Walt. Yes, Walt. Walter. My father was Walter. He said not to worry. He's alright. He stopped drinking. He had a drinking problem? No, he never drank. He was a Salvationist ... he never touched alcohol. No. No! Daddy! No! No! No! Hold it, boss, it's me. Is she okay? - Go to the hotel. I'll stay here. Trust her. He'll be there. Go! You stole my life. No, baby, no ... oh baby, no ... I'm sorry. Don't let me die. How did you get in here? Your mother said. And it's happening to me. Oh God. I didn't believe. She was right. Why didn't I believe her? He's here, is he? You can save me? You have come to save me, haven't you? Only one time, baby. That's all. One more chance. A trick? Revenge. Martha. I dream? Walter Travis? - 404. Cover the back, I gotta get in. You okay? What about Walter? Aren't you interested to know? I stayed here with you. Go. Do your job. I'm fine now. You sure? Gary! He's never knew. - Knew what? If it was a dream. Gary? Martha? Martha! Martha? Mind if I use the phone? - Sure. Did you see her? - Yep. Sure it wasm't a ghost? None of us has seen her for years! So you told me. Chatwin? - Jay? Gary. I found her, but she won't talk. - Then it's a waste of time. Listen, I've got some great photographs. I can still give you a terrific story. Send me the photos. I'll see what I can do. Right. You wanted to see me, Jay? - These just came in from the lab. What is this shit? Are you on mushrooms or something? Are you sick? Are you drinking too much? Sniffing glue? Kadzu. Goddamn kadzu. You know, we can't kill this stuff, Jay. Nothing can stop it. Nothin'. You know you're gonna have to see the company doctor ... we'll need a drug test. Jay? Gary? - She's still out there, Jay. Somewhere. And I'm going to find. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but I'll find her. Now you see me? Now you don't. :: Re-synchronisation ferneiva ::
