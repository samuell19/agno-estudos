...:::: SiliconChip ::::... Burnt [2015] [speaking French] Is this asshole a friend of yours, Conti? [speaking French] A close friend. Also, add some chopped sage, why not? [speaking French] You don't remember what you did to me? [speaking French] You called the health inspector. After releasing rats into my new restaurant. [speaking French] Oh, wow, that's terrible. [speaking French] That's bullshit. [Speaking French] Okay, pal. We're good? [speaking French] Michel is in Paris. [speaking Italian] But they sewed his nose back on. [speaking French] Michel you allowed a portion of scallops to remain in the pan for an extra minute because the garnish wasn't ready and then you served it. Why did you do that? [speaking French] We were backing up, Chef. If I had thrown it away, the whole table... [speaking French] Then you throw it away. If it's not perfect, you throw it away. No matter what. [speaking French] Is it okay? [speaking French] Yes, chef. [Michel speaking French] Bonesis? [Tony speaking French] Adam still owes him all that drug money. [Michel speaking French] Why don't you lend it to him? [Tony speaking in French] I offered, but he won't take it. [speaking French] Michel, those kids there... do something my friend. [Adam speaking in French] How are you? [speaking French] We were beautiful together, you know? [speaking French] Is it okay? [speaking French] It's perfect, exactly how you like it. [speaking French] Are you absolutely sure, my friend? [speaking French] I checked it myself. It's great. [speaking French] You're a very lucky man. [speaking French] You're better off without me. It's going to be a long, hard road. But slowly... I hope to regain everyone's respect and be worthy of your father. [speaking French] I liked your cook from the other night. She seemed nice.
