OCR'd, resynced and corrected by explosiveskull Well, he's your dad. I mean it is his rule. Anyone who sleeps in late... Run, run, run. Honey. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Are you worried about today? I'm taking 150 teenagers into the wilderness for three days. What's to worry about? You're right. There's nothing there to lose sleep over. Sterling? What are you listening to? General Conference. You're not supposed to have that. Mind your own business, okay? 'Cause like sacrifice is for losers. Hey, that's mine. Gotta get down to the church, for all I know they could high diving into the baptismal fountain by now. Honey. It's a stake activity, you really think anyone's gonna be on time? See ya in three days. Make sure you match the code on the sheet with the one on the envelope. We got it, mom. We're gonna have to wrap this up. Hey, David Reader, is that us? That's right, Jamie, we had to use some of our own family history. How many of these did you end up doing, gran? 150, one for each trekker. Brother Pratt wanted to make sure that each of the kids has someone to represent who actually crossed the plains. They mentioned that at orientation, right Tom? Oh, I don't know, grandma. Well Brother Pratt, he is such a great man. That's why it makes me so sad... Hey, hey Tom, have you finished packing yet? We need to be down to the church in a half an hour. The activities they plan for the young people nowadays are so special. They come back with such strong testimonies. You'll be all ready for you mission Tom. Oh yeah, that. Have you thought about where you want to go? Yeah, I was thinking Brazil. Teaching among the Lamanites, wonderful. I was actually thinking about all those nude beaches. At least we know your grandmother's pacemaker still works. Yeah well, would you rather I told her the truth? All right, just go get your pack on. I'll take you to the stake center. No, I'm not going. Why not? Because I don't want to pull a simulated handcart for three days so I can have a simulated spiritual experience and gain a simulated testimony. Correct me if I'm wrong, but you had a great experience at youth conference last year. Yeah, but that's when I thought all that stuff still worked. Listen Tom, I know it hurts... Oh, no I'm not. Forget about it. I'm going back to bed. Tom, just wait. Just give this a chance. I mean spend some time with your friends and hang out in the trees and the fresh air. Look at the stars. I really don't want to. All right, no pressure here, but dude, it's a camp outwith girls. Dad, please don't ever do that again, it's scary. Seriously though, if you go on this trek, I'll pick up your ski pass this season. Deer Valley? Don't push it. Okay just... Are you gonna carry that thing the whole way? Her name is Elizabeth Barton, and I call her Lizzie. And yes, mothers carry their children across the plain. That's because they had to, okay. It's not like they sewed one just for the trip. At your level of spiritual development, I don't expect you to understand it Sterling. Shauna, I have more spirituality in this pinky than you do in your entire body. You know you can't wear those clothes, right? Yeah, well what I know is that you can mind your own business. Oh my freakin' heck! Good morning Susan. Good morning. Hey, do you have your test strips? Right in here. Great. Your blood sugar gets low, you'll let me know. I know, I will. Okay thanks, have fun. You Pratt? Ms. Needles? Mr. Pratt, nice to finally meet you. This is Wendell. He drives the supply truck. Oh great, hi. So this your rodeo? My? Well I'm the medic... Are you the trail boss or not? Well I don't think I call myself the boss that title belongs to my wife. We're looking for the guy who can make sure nobody goes potty on the trail. Yeah well, then I guess I'm your guy. Morning Sister Bartlett. Good morning, Brother Crabbe. Outstanding day, isn't it? It is a really sunny day for a long... It reminds me of midsummer Reykjavik. The sky doesn't get any bluer. Yeah, Wes is gonna love your hair after you've slept on the ground for three days. Get lost, you little creep. Hey. Hi. You look great. Really? Oh yeah. Thanks. Oh hey guys, I didn't mean. Oh, I can't tell you how long I've waited for that to happen. Hey what happened to ya? I had to buy oranges. I thought you already had bought... Don't ask. Hey Brother Pratt. Yo dude, looking good with the whole you know hat n'stuff like that. You look like one macho Mormon trekker. Well at least my face ain't gonna get fried, gringo? You allowed to post that 'cause they don't let you bring electronics on this. Dude, relax. It's all good, okay. Brother Pratt asked me to bring it I guess to make a home video about it or something. That's chill, that's chill. Just leave me out of it, okay? No worries, you're gonna bring down my views anyway. That's harsh, man. That hurts my feel goods. Yeah well guess what, I hope it does. Hey look Tom came. I thought Tom wasn't comin'. Hey Tom! So what they give you? What? You know the parental units, what did they give you to join this ritual of misery? Right, last we talked you were binge watching The Walking Dead this weekend. Season pass, Park City. Sweet man, I wish my parents would give into bribery. - Hi guys. - Hi Brother Pratt. Got three days worth of batteries, Mike? Okay, the three of you look great. The two of you look decidedly 21st century. Sister Bartlett has all kinds of hats and vests and things. Go take care of it, will ya? Perfect. And, here we are folks already stepping back into history. Check out these bandidos peligrosos. Say hello to history, boys. Okay, we're done. Turn that off. Hey Amanda. Hey guys. Hey Amanda. Who's your friend. This is my cousin Anna. This is Mike, and these are The Beverly Hillbillies. Howdy fellas. Hi, I'm Tom. Are you ready for this bizarre cultural ritual thing? Let's call it Mormon cosplay. Nice, I like that. That's funny. Awkward. I'm Sterling by the way. Hey. So Mike, you're going to video us? Yeah, Brother Pratt you know he actually asked me to bring it, and so I brought it. And, yeah. Cool, cool. Oh, come on Anna. I want you to meet Marsha. She knows everything about everyone. Okay dude, she's gone. You can reconnect your brainstem. I didn't know anyone would look that hot in gingham. Okay, okay listen 21 Pilots three weeks from Friday. I got the tickets. She's not gonna come if you don't ask. I know it's just she can get any guy she wants and so... Yeah, yeah, she can okay. So you gotta convince her that that guy is you. It's you. I know I just, I know... Do you have a stutter? Okay, what are you talking about Mike? You've been waiting to turn 16, so you can ask her. Yeah, when no one's actually gonna have a heart attack when you hold her hand. Listen, she has three days where she can't even check her Instagram. Get it done. Hey Marsha, I want you to meet my cousin Anna. Oh my heck, that is such a cute dress. Did you make it? No, it was my Aunt Elaine's. She made it for the road show I think. Oh, well this was my sister Jill's dress. She wore it on a trek like this I think three years ago. Well anyways, when she got back, it had all these spots on it. Turns out it was chicken blood. Ew. Ew. All right, thanks for gathering around. Let's get this thing started. Now, all of you got the list, right? You know what I mean? You remember the list? The list of things you can and cannot take on trek list? Okay now listen, we're serious about this. In order to keep this reenactment as realistic as possible, we're gonna stick to it. So there will be no extra or unauthorized food, no technology of any kind, no iPhones, iPads, Androids, Kindles, earbuds, you name it. Those of you with medical exceptions, you know who you are... As for the rest of you, get your bags out. Judgment day's at hand. Thank you Brother Crabbe. Hey, just gather your things. We'll meet kindly under the awning over there. Thank you. Oh man, I am so hosed. Guys, what am I going to do? Uh, start eating, man. Look, it's not funny, man okay. I got like $100 worth of food in here. Go ahead, make my day. Hi guys, I'm sorry, but you're not really supposed to have those. Hey, I need that. Hey! Whatever happened to free agency, huh? The world's gonna hear about this, hashtag satan's plan. What do you want? Look okay, we can open her head and stuff her full of food. That's sick. That's like cannibalism or something. Look you can stitch her up in two seconds. Nobody's gonna know the difference at all. If sacrifice is for losers, than that makes you? Okay, okay, look it's just a doll, man. I'm making you an offer. What do you want? Anything. I get to drive your car anytime I want for the rest of the summer. No. No, no, no, you just have your learners. Okay, you're going to crash it, no. Sterling, we're not negotiating here. Okay, okay, okay, just do it. Oh, and you're paying for gas. No way. Fine. Okay, okay. Oh, come on. It's 7:00 am. for heaven's sakes. Gross. Is this something I should worry about? It's all taken care of. Jesse's keeping an eye on them. Maybe this is an inspired activity. All right everyone, before we hit the road, let's have a word of prayer. Mike, would you offer that for us please. Sure. And brethren, hats off. Dear Heavenly Father, we thank thee for this beautiful day. We thank thee for the opportunity for all of us to go on trek. We're grateful to be out here in this beautiful place with good friends. And please, we ask, Heavenly Father, that thou will watch over us and be with us on the river today. Please bless Lehi doesn't get scared and cry on the river. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. Amen. Amen. Alright everyone, let's load up. All right, now we're about to head out on trek. Let's find out what everyone has to say. Hey Lehi, do you think this trek will be hard for ya? Oh come on, these things are gonna have like wheels, and there's gonna be like 10 people pulling 'em. What's the big deal? True, true, true. How 'bout you, Brad? What are you expecting out of this trek? I hope 10 minutes in it starts raining, and it keeps raining for three days straight. That would be lit, right? Am I right? True, true. How 'bout you Bobby, you ready for this? I don't know. I'm gonna miss my phone. Ah, he's gonna miss his phone. Miss Anna, what are you expecting out of this trek? Ah, I honestly have no idea. Me too, actually. How 'bout you Shauna? Worried about any snakes? There are gonna be snakes? I'm out. I can't do this. Me neither. Amanda, um, sorry, what are you expecting this trek? I don't know, maybe lose a few pounds. I think you're fine just the way you are actually. Well thanks, Mike. Mike, shut it off. I don't even have all my makeup on today. Sorry. Look into my eyes, Mike. Three days. All right everybody let's load 'em up. Three days. Come on, come on. Let's go. I've got one question, what the hell are we doing up here? What you want to go down? No. They'll think we're a bunch of weenies right now if we go back down. See you in the river. Oh crap. Tom? Tom? Tom, it's time to go. All right everyone, listen up. All right, let me turn some time over to Ms. Needles for a few last reminders. She's the head of Another Man's Shoes Living History Reenactment Excursions. So please everyone, listen up. As of this moment, we are guests on federal land. And, they expect us to follow a few simple rules. Number one, stay on the designated trail. If you get separated, follow the white cow skulls. That's what they're there for. Number two, no fires except in designated areas at designated times. Number three, don't leave trash of any kind behind. So if you drop it, pick it up or someone may very well make you eat it. Okay, that's, thank you, Ms. Needles. All right, I need the following people to come up here and form a line please. Jeremy Wright, Chelsea Martin, Tom Jensen, Amanda Peterson, Anna McDowell. Do they know, I'm not... Don't worry about it, come on. Sterling Bennet, Marsha Hegstrom, Mike Sandoval. All right, in the past your leaders have been the parents of your groups. But, we feel there's an opportunity for you older kids to learn things a little bit differently. Your leaders are still gonna be with you, but this time you're in charge. Anna, can I see that envelope? Thank you. Now, there are two envelopes of each color, one for the ma, and one for the pa. Inside is the rest of your family group. Your job is to help the company, keep 'em happy, make sure they drink plenty of water, and rub their feet if they get tired. Except you Sterling. All right, find your partners. We've gotta move quickly. We've got a lot of ground to cover, all right? Always knew I'd end up with someone tall, dark, and handsome. Hi. Hey. I guess you and I... Yeah, I guess. In each of your envelopes is the biography of someone who walked over 1,000 miles to join with the saints in Zion in the 18408. A lot of people gave up their lives to make that journey. But, sacrifice is a very personal experience. And, no one knows really how they're gonna react when they're asked to give up something they never imagined they'd lose. These people did, and maybe there's something they can teach us. Okay, it's a beautiful morning, got a long day ahead of us. Let's walk. So you Amanda are cousins? Yeah, I'm just visiting for awhile. Where are you from? Los Angeles. Oh wow. You ever do one of these before? Ah no, I'm not, I don't go to your church. Oh you, oh. So my cousin when she did trek, she had the first day a blister on the sides of her foot like the size of a quarter. And then by the next day, it was like the size of a dollar. And, then I swear I'm not joking, on the third day, it was like half her foot. Isn't that crazy? Hey Amanda? Yeah. So I was wondering you know if maybe you... So who was Mary Thompson. Ah she, I was born in England in 1822. Me and my husband Daniel, that would be you, were taught the gospel by someone named Hebrew C. Kimble. We crossed the ocean in 1849 to join the saints. Oh my gosh. What? Along the way, we lost two children, a six year old boy and a three year old girl. Our provisions have grown so scarce that we have to suck on the seems of the flour sacks in a final attempt to draw the last dregs of nourishment from the threads. That's so sad, you know? I mean what would you even do. Just so... So helpless, so alone. You know what's so cool about fires? What? Everything around us just disappears. I mean like there's no trees, no rocks, no water. It's like we're completely alone. Well you think you're alone, but really anyone who's within five miles can see you. Well you see that's what's so cool. Like we're alone, but we're not. Let's break. Chow! Just pull your carts up here along the fence. Chow! Ah, what's this? That's lunch, eat up brother. Lunch? Like this isn't lunch. It's not even a snack. You don't want it? No, I don't. I mean I want it, but like you don't have any more, do you? Son, are you a priesthood holder? Yeah. Did I just have my personal priesthood interview? Hey Shauna, how's the baby? What? You know the baby, the one that has my stuff in it? Geez, you don't have to make it sound like a drug deal. Well hey man, okay, I'm dying here. You're pathetic. Thank you. - Sterling, Sterling. - What? Hey, come with me will ya? We've got a lot of blistered feet to deal with. And, you've got your first aid merit badge, right? Yeah. Perfect. - Hey. - Hey. Come on. I've seen that. Amanda's really pretty, isn't she? She's, yeah. Have you thought about maybe asking her out? She can go outwith any guy she wants. Mike, any girl here would be thrilled to go outwith you, any of them. Don't make it so hard. You think so? Absolutely. Dating should be fun. You know find someone you connect with and just let things happen. And, do me a favor will you? Whoever you choose, don't just text. Hold her hand, look in her eye. You know that's pretty old school Sister Hanson. Yeah well, don't knock it till you try it. Care for another orange, Sister Bartlett? Oh, I don't know. Is it legal? Well, if you were a teenage boy who needed to learn about discipline and sacrifice, maybe not. But, since that isn't the case. Thank you. That's what I love about this church. Every activity, every interaction is designed to help us realize the truth within us. Have you been in the church long. 473 days, best year and a half of my life. How did you first run into the church? I was in Cartagena doing electronic surveillance on an interest I can't disclose when two young men in white shirts and ties knocked on the door of my bungalow and introduced me to a new way of viewing life. So what were you before that? I was a pagan animist. I'm sorry I'm not familiar with a pagan animist. Mostly I worshiped snakes. Come on, gather around. Let's go. Hey you've got the pair? All right people, we've got a few hours. Let's get rolling, come on. So why are you doing this? I was visiting Amanda. I guess I could've stayed there and watched Amazon Prime. And instead, you're walking for three days and going without food. Why are you doing it? My dad said he's buying me a ski pass. Why would he do that? I think maybe he thinks it's going to improve my attitude. What's wrong with your attitude? What are you a reporter or something? Yeah actually. I'm studying journalism in college in the fall, and you didn't answer my question. Look, let me tell you something. You hang around Mormons long enough, you find out that everybody knows what's true and what's right, and they're all just waiting to help you find it. So wanting to help you is a bad thing? Yeah it is if it's all just made up. I don't know how anybody knows What's true about anything. Okay, so the Three Nephites, they're out there preaching, saving lives, right? Okay. Okay, so what I want to know is what they'd do in their time off. I don't think they get time off. Well they got to get a day off, so what did they do? Go water skiing, play video games, get a smoothie? They have visions, bro. Like they see the whole history of the universe. Super Smash Brothers ain't gonna cut it with these guys. But, the prophet's seen movies, hasn't he? Maybe PG movies. - Or PG-13, shoot. - PG-13, shoot. Is this child you carry, Elizabeth Barton? Yeah. We gather together today to mourn the death of baby Elizabeth Barton, Hey have you seen Shauna? - Shush dude, it's a funeral. - A member of Edward Martin's Handcart Company who was only 1 and 1/2 years old when she passed away in her mother's arms on July sixth, 1856. Lizzie's father, William Barton, followed her in death on September 30th leaving his wife, Mary Anne Wait, what are they doing? and her other daughter Mary Barton to finish their trek by themselves. No, no! No, you can't do that! Wow, he's really getting into it. Better put some rocks on that grave to keep the wolves from getting to the body. But, but... Dude, it's just a doll. Sorry bro. Come on Sterling, let's just try to walk it off, shall we? What do I want to eat? Fried chicken, potatoes and gravy, and a giant lemonade. That's what I want. I want a big half pound burger with lettuce, tomato, ketchup. Homemade scones with butter and my mom's apricot jam. Mike! Porterhouse Steak, medium rare. Pizza with pepperoni and sausage. Blueberry pie. Strawberry shake about this big. Sushi, like crunchy spider roll. There's not actual spiders in it. Bacon with anything. Okay everyone, since we're all here, I guess we can eat. Sister Hanson, would you please bless the food for us? Our Father in heaven, we thank thee for delivering us safely to this place of beauty and rest. We thank thee for this food that we are about to partake of and ask for a blessing upon it. Help us to feel thy holy spirit and follow its promptings. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. Am en. All right everyone, we have hot soup and rolls for you tonight. Anybody hungry? Yeah. Is that it, really? After that long day, nothing? Nothing? Let's go get some food, come on. All right. So how'd it go for you guys? Oh, it was great. You know I got to bandage people's feet today which was awesome. And oh, I watched my Hershey Bar get buried alive which is awesome. And yeah, when that wasn't happening, I had to listen to Marsha Hegstrom talk my ear off. So I don't know, eight out of 10 today. You know I think Marsha's kind of cool. Oh man, that girl can talk paint off a wall. How 'bout you? How's Amanda? Look I was kind of busy with the whole video thing, so I really haven't had a chance to just... No, no dude. You have to talk to her, okay? She's not gonna say yes if you don't ask. Listen, I will. Right. How 'bout you with Anna, Anna? You guys spent all day together. Yeah, yeah, she's very cool. She's not Mormon. Shut up. Hey wait a minute. Doesn't that kind of complicate things? I don't know, does it? Yeah fight, like you're gonna go gallivanting off with a no-mo. I might. You know your mom would freak out, right? Well, I'm through obeying all these rules by some guy I don't even know who invented them to save me from being normal. Whoa dude, just chill out. No, you chill out! Not everyone's trying to turn themselves into some Later Day droid, Sterling. Man, what's your problem? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Could you hold this for a second? Thank you. Oh you know I could never stay mad at you. You crazy. You're getting soup on my pants. Yeah so when my sister did trek, they just murdered chickens. Nice pants, Tom. I mean so the soup was like really a luxury. Did I tell you about the spots on my dress. I mean they were everywhere, and it turned out it was chicken blood. So what's going on with you and Tom? Did I see something happening there? I don't know. What's he like? I think Tom's a great guy. You know he's sweet, and he thinks about things, not just cars and football. He just... What? Well there was an accident last summer, and Tom's best friend, Brother Pratt's son, he was killed. Oh. Yeah so... Attention campers, if you haven't noticed, dinner as it were, is over. So before you bed down for the night, you may want to spend a few minutes taking in this wonder. Oh, and watch out for rattlers. Imagine when it was like this every night, no Netflix, no internet, just this. Not a bad show. We sure don't get skies like this in LA. Look you can see the Big Dipper. Wait where? It's right there. You see the Little Dipper pointing to it. Ah, you can find whatever you want up there if you look hard enough. Look you see that little group of stars over there? You know what that is? What? That's a jacuzzi. Oh a jacuzzi. All that warm water. I can feel the bubbles on my toes. All right, it's time to get some sleep. You've got another long day tomorrow. Brethren, you're with me. Let's go. We'll call it 220 yards south, southwest. So, do you two want to get back to where you belong, or should the three of us kneel down and pray together? Good morning, girls. How does she look so good? Doesn't it make you sick? Tracey, did your boys top up their water cooler yet? Yes, they did last night. Okay, thanks. In the fall of 1856, the Martin Handcart Company hit trouble. They'd walked hundreds of miles. They'd run out of food. And, at one point in a place called Devil's Gate, Wyoming, it began to snow. Heavy, wet flakes fell for hours. And, as they watched that path ahead of them disappear, they knew that freezing and death were just hours away. How do you think they handled that? Did they blame God? Did they curse heaven for being left so alone on that empty, frozen desert? No. That morning, those 250 men, women, and children gathered together, and they prayed. They prayed. And, then sang the Spirit of God like a Fire Is Burning. Though I hate to break this to you, but there's a Devil's Gate waiting out there for each one of us. Probably not today or tomorrow, but at some point, God will push us to the very edge so that we can learn what it is that we really believe. And, I hope at that point that we'll have the faith that they had to look eternity in the face and to know that He really knows us. Okay. Let's walk. Hey. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. We're supposed to get going soon. Okay, great. Is there anything that I can... There's nothing anyone can do, but thanks. Come on. So Amanda, I got these tickets to 21 Pilots, and you know I was just thinking maybe if you're not committed to doing something with someone else that night that you know maybe you and I could, yeah that's great. Just commit. No, I should be committed. I'm a freakin' idiot, man. You know what I'd like to see? What? A pioneer's foot. I mean could you imagine the callouses on that sucker? Guarantee they're an inch and a 1/2 thick. Maybe a couple toes frozen off. Yeah, that'd strengthen my testimony for sure. Oh man. Oh, great. Oh, my heck. Whoo, gird up your loins. Yippee ki-yay, whoo! Okay everybody, ready to go? All right, let's do it! Come on. Come on, guys. Let's go, let's go. Keep pushing, come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Come on, come on, come on. Remember it's not the strength of your muscles, son, it's the strength of your faith. Okay. All right next one. Sterling, you're not even pulling, help! Marsha, not the time. Come on, Sterling, pull! Shut up Marsha. Yay. Thank the maker. Good job, girl. You all right? - I'm okay. - You okay? I'm okay. So is everyone in your family, do they all go to church? Everyone in my family goes to church. Everyone in my family always goes to church. And, you don't like that? No, it's good mostly. It's just it seems everyone is so busy going to church that they don't really see what's happening. Like what? You want to know why I couldn't listen to Brother Pratt this morning? It's because I already know about Devil's Gate. I've been there. Sister Hanson, Brother Pratt, Susan's sick. Susan? Susan, can you hear me? Lehi, go get some juice. It's in a cooler in the truck. Okay, Susan, all right just take it easy. You'll be alright. Hand me the bag, check her meter. Let's get her up. Take that. I'll help you out. Okay, all right. Okay, you're low. Juice'll help. I'm okay. Sure, you are. We'll have her on her feet in no time. This just happens sometimes. I'll be all right in just a minute. You'll be fine. What are you talking about? She's gotta go home, man. She'll be all right, Tom, she'll be all right. No, this is stupid! Let's all just keep walking till nobody can think straight, and then maybe we'll all be so confused that we'll actually think we're feeling the spirit! That's enough, Tom. That is if we're lucky enough to be feeling anything at all, not just drop dead first! No one's dying here, all right? Okay, let's just, everyone, take a breath. Hey you guys, I'm okay. That's great. That's just... I'm outta here. Nobody's makin' you stay, Tom. You want to go, go. Susan, maybe you should go home too. No, I'm having so much fun. I just let my blood sugar get too low, that's all. I never get to do anything. You're not gonna make me leave. Oh, that's great. You're as crazy as everyone else. Shut up, Tom! You don't know how I'm feeling! This isn't about you! All right, just cut it out. Let's just calm down here. Okay Susan, you can stay, but I think you should ride with me in the truck for a little while. In an hour, we'll test your blood and see where you're at. Okay. Tom, make up your mind what you want to do. You can wait for the Needles' truck, or you can come with us right now. Or, you can stay and pull your share of the weight. I'm just gonna drive you up to the dinner camp. I'm sorry, everyone. I apologize for raising my voice. Come on everyone, let's get going. When are you gonna stop beating yourself up, man? So I'm guessing that was about last summer. Yeah, Tom's not usually like that. Till that trip last summer, he was like my big brother. Do you think the water's gonna be anything like it was yesterday? Bobby, that's why we came here. Oh yeah. Don't worry, man. I'm gonna get you through this. Promise? Yeah, I promise. All right, listen up everyone. Today's gonna be a little bit different than it was yesterday. The water's gonna be a little faster, and the rapids are gonna be a little bit bigger. Translation, today's gonna be a lot more fun. Exactly, three laws of the river. Never leave the boat, never let go of the paddle, never stop paddling. Say it with me. Never leave the boat, never let go of the paddle, never stop paddling. All right guys, life helmets, life jackets, let's go. Alright, guys. Hey you guys, I'm sorry about going off like that. I'm just... Well, I don't know about the rest of you, but I thought it was brave. It's not easy to stand up to someone especially when they're leaders like that. Even if I made a total idiot of myself? No, Anna's right. Everybody knows you were just thinking about... Thinking about what, about Kent? Yeah, I guess I was. But, I still shouldn't of yelled like that, so I'm sorry. That's not what you should apologize for, Tom. It's not? Nope. What you should apologize for was when you almost left us to pull that freaking handcart up a mountain. Remember that? Shoot. You guys hear that? Let's go see what it is. All right, that was wonderful. Listen, no pioneers day was done without kicking up a little dust before the end of the day. So brothers, I see a lot of wonderful sisters out there. So grab a partner before they're all taken. Let's go. So nobody told me Mormons like to have fun. I know. It's shocking, isn't it. Yeah. You want to dance? Sure. Do you want to dance, Amanda? It's boring. It'll work. Hey Amanda, do you want to dance? Sure. Come on. Well I got a burning in my bosom that tells me if a guy wants to score something, you guys are the ones to talk to. Am I right? Okay, okay. What can I get for this? Dude, it's good for 50 meters underwater. It's gotta be worth something. Have you seen Sterling? Oh well, Sister Bartlett told him that he was supposed to clean up dinner tonight, but I don't know where he went, so I had to do it. So how's your video going? It's going good. I mean kind of hard when you only have footage of people walking, walking, and just more walking. But, I did get this pretty cool shot of Brother Crabbe as the angel of death. Yeah, he was born to play that part. Hey, you know I think your YouTube channel's pretty cool. You watch it? Yeah, I mean I love that one where you have the dog, and you got it on a snowmobile. How did you get it to do that? Funny story with that. So I got dog food, right? And, I just smeared it all over the seat, and... Do you just want to dance, Marsha? Yeah sure. You gotta be careful though when you dance out here 'cause my sister Jill when she did trek, she danced into a cow pie the size of Orem. That's amazing. Samoans rock! Thank you. So what about you, Anna? What about me? I don't know, why are you really here? I told you I was visiting Amanda. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. You just planned a visit while your cousin was going on this three day trek in the desert. I'm here because my parents are getting a divorce. They ignore each other all day, and they scream all night. I figured if I was going to feel all alone, it'd be easier without all the screaming. Oh. I'm sorry. I'm going to school next month anyway. It's just hard finding out that something you really believed in isn't what you thought it was. Yeah, I know what that's like. Oh yeah. It's so good. Thank you. Thank you everybody. It's now time to get some sleep. Go back to your campsites. Goodnight. Goodnight, Tom. Hey Brother Pratt. I'm really sorry about earlier. Tom, I'm sorry too. What do you say we just forget about it, shall we? Yeah. Goodnight. Oh. Marsha? A skunk just licked me in the face! It's not funny. Oh no, ding it and dang it, no. Shoot! All right everyone, last day! Let's go! Looking good. Everything all right? Right as rain. Listen, we're gonna drive on back to the trail head, make sure the trail's shipshape. You all right with that? Sounds good. See you tonight. Don't touch poison ivy. Don't touch that. Don't touch it. My leg, my leg, my leg. Oh my heck Sterling. This happened to my cousin when he was on trek. His ankle swelled up like a balloon and then turned a color that our mouth gets when you eat too many grape popsicles. Marsha, you don't need to be doing this right now. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. All right Sterling, what happened? I just fell on the ground. I twisted my ankle really bad. I blacked out, and I don't know. I just woke up on the ground. And, it hurts. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts really bad. All right, let me see. Let me see. - Is it this leg? - Yes. Okay. This one? Yep. Okay, yeah no. Don't, don't, don't touch the shoe. It's gonna blow up like a balloon. Don't touch the shoe. It's fine. This ankle? Okay don't that's really hurting. Just put me in the truck. Just put me the truck and give me a Twinkie. Just give me a Twinkie and put me in the truck. I'll be fine. In the truck? Okay, right. All right. Hey guys, could you help lift Sterling into the truck please? Whoa, stop, stop! Don't move. Okay Sterling, shush, Sterling. Okay, don't move a muscle. There's a rattle snake. No shush, don't breathe. Shush. All right just. Sterling, Sterling, listen. Slowly, slowly turn your head to the right. Slowly turn your head to the fight. I don't want to hit you with this. Oh Sterling, watch out! That was too easy. I'm glad you're okay, Sterling. What was that Brother Pratt? His ankle will be fine. That's not funny. Come on guys, I think it's time for Sterling to pull the cart by himself! Come on. Oh no, come on, it was a joke. Yeah well, it wasn't funny. It was funny. I thought it was funny. No, it wasn't, Sterling. Go! I bet there's gonna be a big turkey dinner once we get back to camp. I'm gonna eat so much food. I'm gonna stand up straight, and then I'm going to throw up. I don't think that's quite the point of this experience, Brad. Hey are you okay? Sister Hanson, Sister Hanson! I think Susan's sick again. You're gonna be alright. All right, this has slowed you down a little bit, but the Needles are bringing up the read in their truck. No problem. We'll need to get Susan back which means you're in charge Tom for real. I got it. Drink lots of water, and we'll see you at dinner. All right. Okay. Good to go. You're going to be alright. We'll see ya. Well, let's go. What are you doing? He took my spot. Whoa, whoa guys, stop the cart. Listen, do you hear that? Tom? You know what I'm thinking? You guys, I don't know. It'll be 10 minutes. It'll be quick. Yeah, just put the cart right there. You can see the trail from there. Let's go, let's go. Okay you guys, we better get going. Five more minutes. Yeah, five more minutes. All right, I gotta get Susan off this mountain. I'll be back in a couple of hours. You got everything under control? Yeah. Alright, I'm grabbing a couple things. Make sure she's ready to go. I'm gonna go try to find something more substantial to eat, okay? Thank you. You poor, poor thing. Here, lay down. She is hot. Here, this might help. Here. There we go. Okay. Seriously guys, that turkey's not coming to us. Mmm, turkey. I think I can smell it from here. Let's go, let's go. Come on, come on, come on. Man, I cannot wait to sleep in my own bed. No rocks. No bugs. No, Lehi snoring. I do not snore. Lehi, you snore like a goat with a cold. Oh come on, you gotta be kidding. It's true, it's true. That's ridiculous. Hey Tom, how far did Brother Pratt say we were from the last camp? He didn't say. When was the last time anyone saw a cow skull? I haven't seen one of those since... Since the creek. They were so dirty by the third day that when they got out of the shower, it was like... Has anyone seen any wheel ruts? Well, the ground's been pretty hard packed right here, so we probably wouldn't see it. It's too dark to see anything. It can't be much further. Let's just keep going. I'll tell ya, the butterflies in the Venezuelan rainforest are astounding. Big as your hand, gorgeous colors, reds, yellows, blues, almost as brilliant as your eyes. Water? Thank you. Water? Ow, ow. Are you okay? - Yeah. - Are you all right? Can you walk? Come on then, let's go. Tom. Tom? We need to talk. About what? What do you want to talk about, Brad? We just need to decide... Decide what? What that we're lost? Okay yeah, maybe we are. The only thing we can do now is to keep going and look for some light, so let's go. I'm really cold. Look, you're gonna be alright. Susan didn't leave any food behind did she? Look, we're going to be fine. We've just gotta keep going. Now come on. Wendell? Hey, you didn't happen to see Tom Jensen's group at the end of the line, did you? Nah. We were way back behind the last group. I didn't see anybody. Come on you guys, just a few more feet. You set down, put it down. Get a rock. Brake the wheels. You got it? - We're good. - Hang on. - Okay, we're good. - Got it? Where are the lights? Where are the lights, Tom? It can't be much further. Look, there's a ridge up that way. I bet we can see the camp from up there. You want to go all the way up there? Do you want to find the camp or not? Tom, for all you know, we could've been going in the opposite direction. We could see Colorado from up there. No, no, we're not that far off. You don't know everything, Tom. Yeah well, I know enough to keep from tripping over my own feet, Lehi. Tom. You know what, forget you man, all fight. I'm going back to the trail. I'm right behind you, bro. Come on, hey stop. - Stop! - Get off me! Tom. Lehi, get back here, Lehi. Shut up! Way to go, Tom. Way to go! We've gotta stay together, Lehi, come on! So we can listen to you complain all night? Yeah, no thank you. Shut up, Lehi! You're not the boss, Tom! Yes, I am. Brother Pratt told me right before we left. Yeah, and you've done a fantastic job so far, haven't you? I told you to shut up, Brad. Do you realize that people are gonna die because of what you're doing? I said shut your mouth. Guys! Guys, the cart! Lehi! The cart! Lehi, look out! Lehi. No, no, no. On three. Bobby! Don't do it! Don't do it! Kent! Kent no. Here take it. We can do this. You okay? Where's Kent? Where's Kent? I don't know. I am so sorry. Do you see him? Anyone got eyes on Kent. Grab your paddles. There he is, there he is! Lehi, Lehi! Lehi, talk to me. Talk to me. He's alive. He's alive, hey, hey, hey. Where does it hurt? Everywhere. Hey guys, listen up please. Has anybody see Tom Jensen's group? Anybody? All right if you haven't heard back from us in two hours, call the county sheriff about getting a search team up here, all right? All right. Everyone, good luck. He doesn't look so good. He's half in shock right now. We need to get a fire started. Who's got some matches? Brad, don't you have some matches? There's like two left. All right, well we're gonna have to make do with these. Let's gather some stuff to make a fire. The sage is still green, so don't use that. Look for things like you know paper or dry grass. You know anything to start a fire. Tom, Tom, what about the cart? Oh, I am going to enjoy this. Tom? Tom? Do you think maybe we ought to pray before we try this? Yeah, okay. Brad, will you say the prayer? You do it, Tom. Lisa, would you mind saying the prayer? Tom. Lehi? I want you to do it. Father in heaven, Father in heaven, if you're out there, if you can hear this, we're in trouble here. It's my fault. This is my fault. But, that is no reason that these guys should have to pay for it. We need help. We can't do this on our own. Come on, Tom. You know what to do. We need to be found, Heavenly Father. We need to be seen. Seen. This isn't right, we shouldn't be down here. We need to be up there. We need to move this. Set him down. Stop please. Lehi, let's never do that again. You think that was bad? I'm 30 pounds lighter now than I was on Thursday. Wait, wait, wait, hold on! Don't light that! Father in heaven, we have some kids lost out here tonight. I need your help. Please. Now, we're talking. Okay, try that. Light that up. Feel that? Bobby! Okay. That works. Thank you. One, two, three. So what do Mormons do when you get in trouble? Mostly we just eat. ♪ The spirit of God ♪ ♪ Like a fire is burning ♪ ♪ The latter day glory begins to come forth ♪ Hey guys, shush. Do you hear that? Do you hear that? Hey! - Hey! - Hey! Hey! Hey! It worked. Brother Pratt! You okay? You all right? You're gonna be all right, Lehi. So are you, Tom. Here you go. You know what let me grab you some water. He got the can, he sprays it. The fire explodes. You did good out there today, Tom. I got us lost, and I nearly got Lehi killed. Sometimes, it seems so... Do you ever feel... That day on the river. I prayed so hard, Brother Pratt. I tried so hard to believe. Tom, I wish I could tell you why Kent died that day. But, I can't. There are things that happen here that may never make sense. But, this I know. That day on the water Kent gave his life to save someone else. I mean isn't that what we're supposed to learn, what God sent his son to show us. So when those days come, when it doesn't make sense, when it feels so alone, I try to remember that. And, I hope, the next time, I see my son, he's as proud of me as I am of him. So that would be plate number? This, broseph, is plate number four. Oh, hey that thing earlier did you do it? You asked? Yeah. Hi Sterling, hey scoot. Hi. Hey. All right, all right. Cool guys. So good. Hey. I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm sorry too. We good? Yeah, we're good. All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you mind if I join? Please sit down. Okay, it looked a little full. Everything tastes so good. Even the peas, I hate peas. These are incredible. It's just one crazy thing after another out here, huh? Yeah. Yeah, speaking of crazy, what happened out there on that hill tonight, Tom? Where did that idea come from? I think, maybe we weren't as alone out there as we thought we were. There was a huge hill. I ended up using this hairspray that I found in a makeup bag to start the fire. We had like one match left. We were so worried. Hey guys. You came! I was so worried about you. I'm glad you guys are home. - Yeah. - Group hug. - Oh group hug - Good to see you, yes. Oh Tom, you smell so bad. You guys stink so bad. That is... ew. Oh okay, put it away and give me a hug. Come on. I'm gonna miss you, Carol. I'll miss you too, good job. Thank you, I tried. You did it. You did it, right? - I thought I was gonna die. - Didn't think you could. Oh there you go. How does it feel? You are now in the camera. Hey Brother Pratt. I just wanted to say thank you. You're welcome. You should come over some time. Cindy would love to see you. Yeah, yeah, I'll do that. Thank you. Been a pleasure, Sister Bartlett. Goodbye Brother Crabbe. Sister Bartlett, I was wondering if perhaps you'd care to join me in my home for a scripture study some Sunday evening. Oh, I'd probably be up, oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, I look horrible. Oh my gosh, don't look at me. Turn away. Stop it, please. You are the most lovely, most striking, sensitive, tender creature I have ever seen. All right, Brother Crabbe, you want to knock that off? Here you are. Thank you. You're welcome. This belongs to you. It does. Another adventure in the books, huh? I'll see you Sunday. You two, be good. One heck of a vacation, huh? Yeah, let's see I got seven new blisters. I got to see a compound fracture up close, and I ate quite possibly the best turkey dinner that's ever been cooked on the face of the planet. So not bad for a long weekend. Yeah no, that's not bad. Well hey, it was nice to meet you. Maybe I'll see you around in the fall. What? Oh the school I'm going to to study journalism, it's this private school. It's actually broadcast journalism. I don't know maybe you've heard of it. It's called Brigham Young University. Oh. You mean you're going... You know Provo's just down the road. Shauna, slow down! Sterling? Sterling? Sterling? What are you doing here? Sunday school started like 10 minutes ago. Yeah, I know. Sunday school's for losers. Fine. Let's do it the hard way. Thanks guys, the worth of the soul is great, even his. No problem. Absolutely. Oh man. All that spirituality in your pinky? This is for your entire soul, Sterling. Don't you guys need to be in like Sunday school or something? Sister Anderson sent us to find you. Relax dude, she brought us treats. You didn't think we were really going to keep it, did you? You guys, rock! OCR'd, resynced and corrected by explosiveskull
