SUBTITLES BY SEGLORA A CRIME Oh! They seemed to be busy today at the EPA store today? Is this a cheese? What a strange coincidence!I am also a cheese - the happy cheese(Swe. idiom)! I also live here. I have really made an effort to get acquainted with you. I am your charming neighbour and I live in the apartment above yours. Risberg, Bror, journalist. Yes I know At least I am recognized! Thank you,happy cheese.Apart from "happy" what's the name of the cheese? -S?terj?ntans whey-cheese. -Whey-cheese.That tastes better with liquor and what is in store for the finder? -Help me with door first. -Moment!! The bridal couple first. What is the young lady doing to night... What a brute!! Hit a guy from behind! -What is the lady doing tonight? -I am having tea and a sandwich at 830pm. And "s?terj?ntan" whey-cheese.How nice! let us go to the cinema at 915pm No-I am not going out with anybody Precisely my thought.Then we are just created for each others! -Impossible -On the contrary.I am extremely possible -Can you afford to invite me to the cinema? -Afford? Do you really think one needs to buy tickets. The only pleasure left for a journalist is to have free tickets! -God evening, Miss Waldemars. -Howdy! -My pet! Many thanks That means How do you do!! Pardon.Could I have five water jugs tomorrow morning? How nice with charming people! What a magnificent specimen that man Walter Risberg! Now he has got his claws also into her! -The girl Waldemars? HICCUP -Stop that!! Now there is going to be a continuous necking and running in and out all days on the staircase As we are not having enough troubles with that fellow Degerfeldt upstairs Haven't the thought occurred to you that he looks like a crook! What did you say? Well, you are not able to think for yourself! That's easy to understand -Not allowed. -Allowed? -Can't I help you carry the things for you? -No.I live here. All right I see.Here you live. Should I not take the cheese from you whilst you fetch your keys? -It can't be here where you are living? -No, by Degerfeldt,indeed no -Do you know him? -No.Indeed.I have never seen him. -Shall we go to the cinema? -First I'm going to have tea. Alone? If you are nice,you might also have a cup of tea -Lovely -But not before 830pm Well,That suits me fine During the mean time I will arrange a telephone interview with that guy's brother Can I speak to the Lord Justice von Degerfeldt? It is urgent, Miss! What? Is he at his office? At this time? When I redeemed your due bills which you graciously has signed with my name- -then it was on my strict conditions that you should leave the country and never return! You have neglected the condition therefore I demand that you immediately leave the country -Eternal exile, what a humane punishment. -You seemed to console yourself in Buenos Aires. Degerfeldt married to a hostess of a gambling-den! I see that your respect for the dead is as great as for the living! Why do you want to get rid of me now? I have been. home now for more than a year -I have my motives. -Is it because of the morphine prescriptions... -which you also falsified. -The police let the matter lapse. -But not for me.I told you I have my reasons! -Is it because you are afraid of me? No.It is you who are poisoning everything around you. You are dangerous!For everybody! For everybody! Also for your children? Strange that they don't hesitate to associate themselves with me. -This is not true.I have forbidden them. -It seems that they don't care about that You are lying.Here I have your written confession and your obligation to go away forever. Lapsed.It is more than 20 years old. By the way you dare not use that scandal I spare no pains to get you. I believe that of you. Don't you have a symbol for your way of reasoning hanging on the wall? Is it not the roman Consul Manlius -whom you read abut at school -who decapitated his own son when he broke the laws... And now you are trying to copy his way of justice by having me decapitated. But you are not doing it because of the Law- -but instead to salvage yourself and the family from the scandal You should not believe that I am the only black sheep in the family Lord Justice von Degerfeldt. I am busy now. The paper Morgonbladet? My birthday? This is nothing to bother about I don't want to be the padding in your paper! What? My photo? I don't have a photo I haven't had a photo taken for 20 years Hugo! Hugo! I am going to sing a song about a girl... Oh,take it easy! Sorry for standing in your way! That guy was really in a hurry! -Welcome! -Thanks .Hello,girl.Gentleman visit? -Not that I was aware of. -I just wondered Just bumped into this lout on the staircase.He seemed to have come from here - Please come in - Thanks..How cosy That is the way it should be at my place. -Good heavens.What was that? -Degerfeldt's parrot. That one.It sounded like Degerfeldt hims, they have such similar sound I will take the tray! I am used to balance fragile matters That's part of a journalist's work. That was extremely nice of you inviting me You have said that seventy five times already! No.Only seventy three times! PIANO MUSIC -Such a nice tune.Who is playing? -It is him,Degerfeldt. Degerfeldt.Does he play such things? At least a human trait I thought it was his nephew the.. .. modern painter, who played such music No.I really have never heard him playing such tunes. He usually only plays classical music.. And this tune is from the new film "East of Suez" You said film! Damned, We have to hurry up! Come! How thirsty these flowers seem to be! I will give them a shot. Look.If we at least had a car, so we could get away! -You are mad -No.I think.. that we could have a car like everyone else! I wonder how much petrol you have drunken during all these years It would have been enough for many cars But it would have been a proper car. Not that fancy sport car down there Good heavens! How can a person sit in such a car? That doesn't matter. Anyhow,I will never get a sport car. Where have I put my detective story? It was here around! Hasn't the beast placed himself upon Edgar Wallace!And the bookmark has gone. Thanks heavens for having a clear mind and remembering things When Jefferson is tied and thirsty in the wardrobe..... -Now someone is on the staircase again... - Yes -Stop pounding like that.I am not deaf! -I just want to remind you about the water. I have heard that.If I could throw a bucket of water in your face instead! -You like to be teased! -Mrs Dun?r likes to get furious. If this guy is not ending up in L?ngholmenprison,then I would be damned -Good heavens, Degerfeldt's paper! -Please close the entrance door and shut off the light on the staircase. I suppose I have to do it as you are such a nice and sweet chap! Did you phone the plumber about Carlsson three stairs up? Yes When are they coming? - Tomorrow? -Yes tomorrow. So you finally dragged yourself to do it! I suppose you exhausted yourself completely? Completely. -What was that? -What did you say! -I thought somebody passed by! -No! -Strange. -What was it? Nothing, I probably had a hallucination. Anyhow,nobody is there. I am unlocking the door and then I am going up with Degerfeldt's paper. How do you like the cake,Miss Maria? The genuine old fashioned thing, Kristin. Dad will love it Haven't the flowers arrived yet? Oh Dear.It's only half past seven. Hans was going to bring them, so Kristin can understand that I'm worried Good morning ,Mr Hans Here you have to get up in the middle of the night just because dad can't sleep! and all other persons need to be awake -The mornings are the best time for me. -That's just sentimentality.. when you say such things,my dear Maria Anyone with a sound judgment would detest mornings. How do you like this? Wasn't a good idea? Is it not a proper gift to a Lord Justice? Such an odd figure Mr Hans! This is the symbol of the law my dear old Kristin,a paragraph, the symbol of justice. You are always showing off Can't flowers just be flowers? I don't want any moral lectures Please remember that! Kristin,can you sew on a button -Rutger will come? -I was never worried about that It must be at least the fifth time he has given his word never to tread his father's house So he will surely come! He was here this Monday but without Maud. Such a quarrel.He wanted money for his business from father Rutger as a businessman! Even in his private life,he had an extraordinary ability to get broke immediately. Yes.Maud is also not supportive. No.She is like a bottle of kerosene for a child playing with matchsticks. But,by Jove,how beautiful she is,Maria. I am going to cut out Rutger and elope with her to Paris! Nonsense Can you imagine, as soon I am here I get thirsty - Hello! Hello. Here are the swedes coming! -God morning dear Maria -God morning, dear Maud. Such dresses? Where do you come from? We forgot ourselves in a night club,. and had to drive here. Why so in a hurry? Aren't you happy? We are really happy. Aren't we, Rutger? Dear Maria have you got a proper mirror? I have to do my make up. I look awful. Come with me You look funny.Dress suit and bristles. Your gangster features will resurface again at 1 pm. -Can I have a cigarette? -You did come,nevertheless -You dare not. -And you? -Do you think this is a pleasure? -No.I wouldn't say that. Have you seen our childhood's smorgasbord? Nothing has changed. The eggs,the porridge and the loaf of bread. I am thinking of all the porridge father forced upon us! I sometimes dream during the nights about him.. like a cruel giant gluing the throat with porridge! When he saw how pale I got with the disgust he just raised his eyebrows: "You are a coward not overcoming a minor discomfort" "That porridge is going to make you into a man.Eat more,Rutger" Do you remember the time I succeeded in vomiting over the whole table, that was glorious! Yes,I didn't manage to do that Have you really had a closer look at this room? Have you ever seen such a horror room? Not until today have I discovered.. how magnificent devilish it is Look at the back of the chairs. Have you seen anything like it? Like a rigid reprimand for each one of us. Have you seen the color of the wall paper? It is worse than snuff and mildew. I really think I became a painter as a protest against this room Such a nonsense! Protest against a room? No.Against him in there! Darling,how tired you look, go and rest in the library for a while. -It is cold here! -No wonder about it The window is towards the North Pole. Hell, how beautiful you are,Maud! A danger for the common security. God,how tired I am of your jargon! The first time I saw you I became frightened Can you imagine,I got goose-pimples all over my body A moment later I thought I must paint her! "I must paint her!" You don't need to cut me out like dad and .. The Supreme Court It reminds me about the old story about the elephant who wanted to brood over the abandoned partridge eggs -They all crushed. -Hello everybody. Hello, Maud! Hello, morning-hating dandy My God how you smell! Today the whole family seems to be rancid! -Good morning, Bernhard. -Good morning, Maria,but you aren't rancid? Do you also think I smell hospital? The Lord Justice! Has the Lord Justice not slept tonight? I dozed off I have been working in my office room Alone all the night? Oh,Kristin I have been lonely all my life You get tired of it in the end. But you, Brutus, you like me? Me and Brutus wanted to be he first to congratulate you. -Thanks -But now the Lord Justice needs to get dressed -It looks very festive today. -Thank you my dear for your help. Let me go! You see I need to read what the papers are writing about dad. -Hello Bernard -Hello.How elegant! Are you going to the King's castle? God,what is this? Hugo von Degerfeldt murdered... Dead in his apartment probably killed by robbers. -Oh,that's horrible. -Really appalling! Look, Rutger! The murder in the column beside an inquiry about dad That is nice isn't it! I think the murder is reviewed by my old friend Risberg Who is he? Do you know him? He wanted to buy a painting from me but he had no money -Think about Dad and on this day of all -Ah,do you think he is going to miss pretty Hugo? Get me the tabloid! Now it is of course my turn to become the next black sheep in the family! Think of something like this, he does not know anything about! He will soon be here.I will put the paper here so we can see what kind of expression he gets Shame on you! -Good Morning. -Good Morning, dad Andreas. I thank you for all your kindness coming in full force. Rutger and Maud seem even to have dressed up for the occasion. We were out with some business friends and it became very late Yes but it is my fault I am rather cute this way uncle Andreas? -Dad, something awful has happened... -You mean Hugo von Degerfeldt? The police phoned me already last night. Disastrous this day of all.It seems that the murderer is my personal enemy. But the matter does not concern us Hugo von Degerfeldt has been dead for us since 30 years ago In reality nothing has occurred which concerns us. Nothing.Let us sit down. All right let us do that But please dear old Dad.Look. Stearin has dripped on to the cake! But look stearin has dripped on the cake! Dear,Maria,exactly like that have you said on every birthday.Long live the tradition! It cannot be worse than this,Dad? Attendance by gentlemen dressed in morning-coat is the worst thing I know! I have no reasons to decline visits today. -Yes,but my dear Dad -The scandal does not concern us In the highest degree. The scandal is the living-space for the Art My portrait of Hugo will cause a sensation! I forbid you to exhibit it! Prohibition and Prohibition. I am sick and tired of prohibitions You cannot forbid anything for us. We are not any kids any more We can act and think for ourselves What do I hear? Are you able to think? You have prohibited everything. . You tried to stop me becoming an aviator but I became an aviator You have tried to stop me from everything but I have done things of my free own will. But the result is that you are half-broken. You have wasted your mother's inheritance and the other day you approached me and begged me for guarantee and money Which you denied me I could have made a bold move and solved my problems but you are forcing me to go to others.. I will never forgive you for that,Dad I am only waiting for you to have been involved in business with Hugo Have you borrowed money from Hugo? No. At least one positive notice on my birthday -Dad,shall we not blow out the candles on the cake?-Do what you like I prefer to go into my room and work. Good morning, Mr Dun?r. How are you? I understand. Mr Dun?r has never tried water? This is also possible to drink. We will talk later. Tell me when the concierge's wife arrives, so we can start promptly. -Good morning, inspector. -Good morning.Thanks. Nice to come indoors? Damned how cold it is! He must have been sitting at his desk and received the blow like this and fallen forward over the desk Such a marvelous sign of a genius the inspector is showing us! Thanks.I would ask the forensic doctor to check his gaiety. What have we established? First he died between.. 830 pm and 9pm -Secondly.Cause of death.. -Severe contusion at the back of his head Thirdly.It was not a robbery ending in murder as a big sum of money was still left... ..in the drawer,which was broken up probably by the murderer Fourth no fingerprints anywhere Fifth a bottle of morphine . -..on the desk.. -Let's see,open but hardly used -This is from S:t Botvids hospital.. -Well. WHISTLE. -What is it? My colleague Dr Giljams is there.. and he is engaged with von Degerfeldt's daughter Maria.. -who is,if I remember correctly, also nurse at S:t Botvids hospital -What are you saying? We have to check that I have also stated to suspect that one of the Degerfeldt family was behind the murder It couldn't have been a shady drug dealer he would have taken the money from the drawer. The Lord Justice has...leave this to Berggrenl The Lord Justice had all reasons to be angry with his brother Do you remember the business with the falsified morphine prescriptions... How can you drag me around the town like this? Don't you think I have other things to do I only wanted to know whether Mrs Dun?r recognized the sport car from yesterday. Yes, that car I would recognize, such a crazy one How are your small feet now? Don't bother about that and stop touching me Hello,are you in charge of Degerfeldt's car? Can't you show us the car? I am busy.Ask the boss,enter and he will be standing to the right. - Johansson! -There is a guy who want to chat with you -Yes.Thanks. -Well,is this the one? --Yes.This is the car -And Mrs Dun?r is absolutely sure about this?-Sure? I have eyes to see with! -Dear,sweet,beloved Mrs Dun?r.. -Is he starting again? Promise me not saying a word to the police I will give Mrs Dun?r a dozen new Edgar Wallace books from me! -Can I trust you? -Absolutely.Come on. It's a deal. You were spot on,Forenius,this bottle had disappeared from S:t Botvid yesterday. Maria von Degerfeldt is a nurse there and has access to the medicine cabinet- -and furthermore she had a visit from her uncle Hugo von Degerfeldt yesterday. What do you say about that? Did you have any contact with the Lord Justice? Yes.I called him last night. I have the impression that he is hiding something Have you got any idea about the murder weapon? I think so It looks like this Two rectangular,and.. Yes I see it.It could be a spanner.. I really think it must have been that!! I am not doubting your authority But even if the family von Degerfeldt is a bit mad-- -they would not run around with spanners in their pockets! -Well there are.. -You mean cars.That's a suggestion. Has the concierge's wife arrived? -Yes -Bring her in. Please enter,don't be shy. . Please.We don't bite. Please sit down. -Please repeat your name again? -Klara Sofia Dun?r. I am innocent! Of course dear old lady but please sit down! Please Just sit down. I think we will return to our conversation You obviously did not notice when Mr von Degerfeldt returned home Are you always so negligent in your work so you cannot check.. when people are coming and going? Nobody has complained about that. You can't live in the shutter!You have to make coffee,and there are other.. .. necessities! Sure.But at the moment your main need seems to be.. reading so-called detective stories What's wrong with that? You learn a lot of things about the dark sides of life. So you studied the dark sides of life yesterday? I was just reading that part when the butler Jefferson is tied up in a wardrobe and being thirsty- -which reminded me that my aspidistra had not been watered. And then I approached the window-sill and saw the the car parked in the street -Whose car was it? -How would I know? Well,I see. -Which time was it? -I thought the church bells struck three. So it was 8 45 pm. -8 45 pm. -Did you see who was in the car? Yes.A lady. Are you really sure it was a lady? -Well,in the case it was a gentleman -In the case of a gentleman! Now we want exact information! It is not damned easy if you only spot the upper part of the body It was just after 9 pm when you brought the paper to the flat? Was that part of your usual work? Yes,I usually brought up the paper before 8 pm,before Mr Degerfeldt came home. He wanted to see me as little as possible. He was such a strange chap. -You.May I? -Yes.Go ahead. Please tell me, was he very strange lately? Lately? He was always odd. He was mad.Last week he called me an "old opossum". Is that suitable to call a decent old woman? who doesn't even know what kind of animal is an "opossum" ? Well,we did not get much out of you,Mrs Dun?r. -Yes.I do not think I have more to tell. -Thanks for today. -So it is not going to be worse that this? -No.Did Mrs Dun?r imagine that we would bring out the thumbscrews? Yes.You can never imagine what could happen in these places. Could the gentleman please tell me what is an opossum? what kind of an animal is it? It is a beast of prey with nightly itinerant habits. And that should be me?It was more suited to Mr Degerfeldt himself ! And that fellow who stayed up all night making noises who shouted in competition with his old parrot ..so you did not know who was shouting worst Don't you know that you should squeeze your nose and swallow 10 times?! Miss Waldemars, please enter! HICCUP What is the matter with you? Again? I understand. and I will tell you that if you do not return home immediately after your interrogation I will see that you will stay here - for life ! Tell me,Miss Waldemar do you hear everything from your neighbor?s apartment? -No.Only from my kitchenette. -And you are often in the kitchenette? No,but you know that fellow Degerfeldt did not interest me at all So yesterday evening you were really busy house keeping? when you were in the kitchenette around 8 pm? Yes I was.I was making my tea. Did you hear anything from the apartment? Yes.Yes I heard his parrot shouting when Mr Risberg entered. -Mr Risberg,the editor? -Well,what of it? -Hmm -Well I hope so. Are you sure it was the parrot shouting? was it not possible that it could have been Mr Degerfeldt himself? Do you mean that he was murdered just at that time? How awful! HICCUP -Hello,Mr Dun?r! How do you do I understand.That will pass over. Here are some books for the Lady.. Five Edgar Wallace ..thanks for good duty They are good,and for her the best of all. I promise not to tell anything. I understand. Thanks for the useful information Miss Valdemar. Now I think I can get them supplemented from your friend Mr Risberg. -But Good Morning! -Good morning.How do you do. -Thanks.It's OK -Thanks for yesterday -Thank you for coming. -It was nice. I am sure she enjoyed it.. But if you don't mind I think we all say good bye to Miss Waldemars. Well so long.I will give you a ring later. Thanks, Miss Waldemars. Well would it not be better if you somewhat developed your relations with the police instead? I will give you a call.. Now I really want to know what you know about this matter! All right.But on one condition. And that is you provide me with some materials for my paper Scoundrel! Please no harsh words. But I will help you as much as I can allow Well,you saw a man with a grey overcoat leaving Degerfeldt's apartment? No,I did not say that I think we should keep to the truth although we are with the CID No.I happened to bump into a guy on the staircase and as he did not come from my apartment and as there are only two apartments on the landing where Rita lives So it could be possible that he came from Degerfeldt's flat Listen,was he long or short? Was he old or young? How did he look like? Look.I am telling you that I bumped into that guy on the staircase! I did not have time to see how he looked like Even a child can look into your face and see that you are lying. If it was possible that you did not recognize the guy you would have guessed -That's nonsense! -So you went to cinema at 9pm. -Was that car parked at the entrance? -Car?I did not see any car. that Degerfeldt was murdered by a guy.. in a grey overcoat you bumped into on the staircase -and the he run out jumped into the car and disappeared. Oh,how shrewd you are! Who was then playing the tune from East of Suez half an hour later? Perhaps the dead body? Are you sure it was the tune from East of Suez? It just was not something you put into the article as a nice piece of journalism? They were not in Degerfeldt's music notes. So the person playing it, did it by heart. But it could have been yourself There are lots of person knowing that hit song by heart! -Modern persons following fashions -Like the Degerfeldt family It seems a bit odd that the Lord Justice would be some form of a cinema fan Young scoundrel,come here and I will talk to you in private I see through you completely young Mr Risberg Come out with it now - you saw the car! -Yes -Whose car was it? Well.It is possible that it was Hans von Degerfeldt's car. So it was him you met on the staircase! No.It was not. I just saw a grey coat. I do not know who it was. I assure you.I swear that.. Want a cigarette? Oh,no.Not that third rate ones. I don't smoke those ones. Now you can leave. . Yes.But I will not have on my conscience more than I only saw a man in a grey coat Get away immediately before I arrest you! OK.I will do that. Come let's go into my office Such a peace and harmony we would have if we did not have the press! Yes.I wonder what he is going to publish tomorrow. Obviously I have to visit the Lord Justice today I assume the family is gathered today. How noble is a simple chamber-pot.. ..and an ingenious device -compared to this cheap tankard,the symbol... of the curse of the public boredom! Dad.It is dangerous to celebrate your 60 years when you can be exposed to such a bad taste! Hans.Why are you making such a fuss! People intend to be nice! Have you read the latest telegram? This came. "When you become 60 accept our affection" "not the core,but only the shell, will obey the aging of the times" There must be something wrong with the telegraph. -Why? -Letting through such crap Dad, your friends from High Court are here. Good morning,my dear Maria, how are you? My dear friend Andreas... ...we are coming today to celebrate our good colleague- -and the outstanding legal mind. Deep and uncorrupted are your thoughts about crime and punishment It is because of men with your quality which give us trust in the administration of justice. and we therefore want to thank you and give you this.. ...simple gift from your fellows in the High Court I thank you all, my fellows I am deeply moved by this grand homage It is for me during this day,which has its own dark shadows,an enormous joy to see the proof of your indulgence towards me and your kindness .I thank you all! I am really happy coming here to congratulate you. There is a gentleman from the police who wants to meet the Lord Justice. I will see him. Captain von Degerfeldt. Good morning. It is very awkward for me to come on a such day and trouble you.. By all means it doesn?t matter My father is at the moment busy with his fellows from the Supreme Court. As soon as he has finished I will inform him Thanks -Kristin, please help the inspector with his coat-Yes.It is really embarrassing -that on a such a day.. -Please.It doesn't matter Please enter and wait there. I think there should be some papers there. The inspector might get some new details about the murder.. Everything went smoothly!! Your speech was not that bad as I had imagined What did you say? I said that if the gentleman is thirsty.. then there are drinks on the buffet in the dining room. -Please enter there,my dear gentleman. -That was kind of you. But look? A brother in misfortune! I also escaped.It was so damned boring there. I am not one of the guest. My name is inspector Lilja(lily). May I introduce myself Hans von Degerfeldt a somewhat distracted painter Was your name Lilja(lily)? Yes. Has the inspector by any chance changed into that name? No.Why do you ask? Well,I just thought about an acquaintance of me who happened to be an undertaker.. ..and his name was Fr?jd(Joy) He had also not changed into that name. I thought I did not need to inform you that I have really come here on a serious matter Well, it is because I don't want be bored,inspector Don't you think your way of expressing yourself is very inappropriate? I cannot imagine that the inspector .. has not heard about me being the bad egg in the family?A cigarette? -Thanks.I prefer smoking my own ones. -Allowed. I came here to speak with the Lord Justice. Perhaps during the mean time, I hope you don't mind asking you a few questions? With pleasure.Please inspector sit down? Well,what does the inspector want to ask me about? Tell me,you have painted a portrait of the murder..,the dead von Degerfeldt? Yes.I have painted a portrait of him. He was an interesting character.. as the inspector can understand Besides I needed the money. But he did not like my portrait and did not want to buy it. ..There was a lot of fuss about it -Mr von Degerfeldt has a car? -Yes A hire-purchase transactions one which goes on changes of gear(swe double-meaning change=bill) Enormous amounts of changes of gears! Is this an attempt of poking fun with me Mr von Degerfeldt? It seems to be something you do not want to talk about? I really think that the inspector suspects me? Ha.That would be something for my dad! I seriously must ask you to change your tone, Mr von Degerfeldt It would be very embarrassing for your father if I had to take you with me to the police station How disgusting and unpleasant! Couldn't we in good faith tell each other what we did yesterday? -Yes but on the condition I will start -Please I attended an insufferable dinner in the house of royal chief forest officer Bergenstrahl.It was a repulsive party. They had placed me beside an old lady in waiting. Then they served flying roast veal i.e.turkey Yes.Like fruit soup Fruit soup.The worst thing for me. -You seem to have a cast-iron alibi -You should better check that,inspector. I do not think I need that. Yes.Your dad Maud and myself studied together in Lund. I suppose that you feasted a lot! Partied? Yes we had a nice time together. My youth was not very happy.. I was brought up rather alone and abroad. Perhaps it is easy to understand that I am devoid of a soul. What? A soul? No proper mother tongue and no soul. Perhaps it would be better if the Supreme Court condemned and burned me as a witch. As a witch? Dear Maud,we cannot say something like that. No.I think we have to swallow it down with some wine,please. We had a report that a grey small sport car had been going around Djurg?rden last night and run into a hedge with damages As far as I know I have not been near a hedge last night! Dear inspector may I leave now? -We will see each other again. -Maybe,if I may decide the location Please,Dad. Well Mr Rosensch?ld Maud,you can go now. I want to keep Mr Rosensch?ld for myself Please be kind to me Mr Rosensch?ld! And tell me how you are keeping up Have you got any nice crooks at the moment at the Royal Supreme Court? Dad never discuss anything I have nothing more to add to this matter. Everything I know I told you about last night I am sorry I have to insist You,as well as I know that Hugo von Degerfeldt was a bad egg. He forged my name on bills. I had to redeem them with the condition that he should leave Europe It is rumored that he had lots of cash, when he returned home. I know nothing about that. Has the Lord Justice had any contact with him ..after he returned to Sweden? -What do you mean? Has the Lord Justice visited him? Yes. Rather he visited me I ordered him up into my my office last evening. I was trying him to consider leaving the country again But he refused. -And then there was a quarrel? -Yes.You can call it like that. I told him my view of him, and he spat out his hate in my face. The Lord Justice did not meet him later in the evening somewhere else? No. The Lord Justice didn't notice the time when he left your office? I am not walking around with my watch in the hand! Goodbye! How swedish!Not a single word about what all persons had in their mind today -Was it necessary? -No.It can't be helped. You must understand that if Mr Rosensch?ld met someone else in the hell- -then he would ignore completely that he was in a place. so unsuitable for a Lord Justice and would argue that he was sitting on a white cloud instead We are from the Morgonbladet paper We would like to take some photos of the Lord Justice There is just one gentleman left. He will be ready soon. Thanks.We can manage. can you unpack the gears! Rutger: -What did the police say? Hans: -It went from bad to worse.. ..I had no idea that he was a cop. What did he say? He just talked about cars like the worst car sales man! -He also asked about your car. -Why? -I told him, of course, that you had a Buick -What did he say? -Well..... ..He alleged that I had smashed into a hedge in Djurg?rden last night -Is you car broken down, Hans? -No.Not at all. I have to dash off. You have to mind yourself. But stop for a moment How many photos shall I take? -Was it something more? -Yes.Just a small thing. Miss von Degerfeldt has not mentioned about a bottle of morphine? Yes.She really mentioned a morphine bottle which had disappeared at the hospital. She was very concerned about that. What relevance has this with the case? Nothing at all,it was just incidentally. I hope the Lord Justice will excuse me for bothering him. By all means Three or four pictures on him and a few family photos.I have to run off now. -So the journalist is here today? - I haven't done anything! What have you found out? This time I have something really for you. Come along. Rutger,come on, Rutger. -Please.The Lord Justice is free now. -Thanks -What is it? -Rutger... -Maud! -I can't stand staying here . We are not waiting for the others -I am not going home -Not home? Why am I not like a sister for you? Think of having a wife like her! My God,what kind of life have we been living? Why this haste? Do you dislike me? Straighten yourself up, Maud! Cheer up.. Pardon,there is a telephone call for the captain. -For me? -Yes Rutger, don't stay away too long. I don't want to be alone. -I had a telephone call? -Captain von Degerfeldt? Follow us. -So the police? -Yes.Only a few questions. -What we want to... -I understand -I have my wife... -We will tell her. By all means but have you any objections.... We will take care of that. -But... -Please. It was a long time since we worked together. Damned how much murders nowadays both to the left and right People have no respect for their own or others life. We are losing our natural fear. No.Not me. Lucky you! Well as you see.The framing round this crime is not very nice. Why that? The mystery of the crime! What is that for table? Was it there you placed him? Yes.When we arrived, he sat in the chair and had fallen forwards over the table. PARROT SHRIEKING -That was nasty -I wonder if the poor bird has been fed? It was most likely such a shriek we heard at Miss Waldemars yesterday. Probably Were you frightened? -Me? Not at all! Was the bottle there? -Yes Degerfeldt must have stolen it from the hospital before coming to the office of the Lord Justice. And he brought it here just before the murder.. ..but he never had time to use it. -Why have you placed it here? This is my business.Everything should be as it was during the murder. You are really going to indicate it in "Crime and Punishment" in six tomes then? If you are going to utter a word,you will be thrown out.You will have a more rough time here than at the police station. I hope you are not imaging that criminals like that would admit voluntary? They are coming.Quiet! Sit down there. Good afternoon again, Captain von Degerfeldt. -Please sit down. -Thanks.I prefer standing. Is it unpleasant for you to sit down just here? Why have you arrested me? Why have you separated me from my wife? What kind of bloody trick is this! You are not arrested.Your only at the disposal to the police- because you have given false statements about your whereabouts during the evening of the murder. You are not allowed to meet your wife so you will not have the opportunity to agree more lies By the way I want you to know that your wife will be interrogated after you Every demonstrable lie would be at your own peril Look captain von Degerfeldt Please keep to the truth and tell me where you were before you went to Royal last night? My earlier statements are true. I will not change anything. They are not true. The car has been recognized. -Which car? -Your brother's, you borrowed last night. What has his car to do with this matter? It is correct that I borrowed his car but it does not prove that I was here. You did not read by chance in the newspaper about a man in a white overcoat who was seen at the staircase at 0830pm Because I have a white overcoat you assume it must be me? -The most stupid thing I ever heard! -Perhaps not that stupid -Journalist Risberg recognized you. -Who is that? One of our witnesses. He happened to be in the flat beside here between 0830pm and 9pm and you bumped into him on the staircase. How dare you! Are innocent persons to be sacrificed .as padding in your damned scandal-sheets? Calm down! How was it now? I am not changing anything. I will not utter a word Think carefully Captain von Degerfeldt. Your tactic is not very ..favorable for yourself now. -I am not saying any word more. Then must we bring your wife here. It will be a very strict interrogation Shame on you! How dare you torment an innocent woman! It is yourselves ,who compel us to do this. Follow the captain out and let the wife come today What do you mean saying that I recognized him! That is a lie.I did not recognize anyone. Calm down. We are trying to get a confession from a killer The society must protect itself from criminal forces and sometimes using their own method the bluff That is horrible. I may convict him. It would be his own fault that would convict him,if he is guilty Please sit down Mrs von Degerfeldt. Thanks.I did not know the police being that chivalrous. From the beginning I would recommend you to use another tone It was in this room Hugo von Degerfeldt was murdered. And your view is that it is suitable to bring me to his room? Allow myself to chose methods. Please sit down. I withdraw about the police being chivalrous If you are going to frighten me I can tell you.. ..I have experienced both revolution and war I am hardened. I know that.Otherwise you could not ..have been participated in this. -What do you mean? Mrs von Degerfeldt.We know everything what happened here yesterday. We also know that Hugo von Degerfeldt was a morphine addict Your husband came here last night between 830pm nd 9pm and wanted to sell this morphine bottle but he charged too much Are you accusing my husband,Capt von Degerfeldt of being a drug dealer! Yes.It was like that That is a lie -The bottle was already here... -So you were here? You already knew that.You don't need to nag about that.I hate tedious passages. If these are tedious passages it's your fault -What brought you here? -Nothing at all... It was unpleasant and we managed to leave at 800 pm. -At eight o'clock? -May I smoke? Please The neighbours heard quarreling. Can you remember what you quarreled about? As far as I remember there was no quarrel The men discussed businesses. Nothing else. I am absolutely sure that they discussed more thrilling things.. I want you to tell me about it,now! A burdensome quality in a civilized society. Mrs von Degerfeldt play the piano? Do you recognize this melody No! no! Stop! You may not! It reminds me of my time in China. Once a bullet smashed my mirror whilst I was dressing. No,stop!I can't take it anymore. It was four years ago you were in China. The melody is new for this year. -What do you mean?What are you driving at? -It was played yesterday here by yourself! Hugo von Degerfeldt was already dead according to forensic evidence. Could you please tell us why you played for the dead man? We are innocent! I swear that we are innocent! Why can I not be with my husband? I am getting mad without him! Berggren.Go down and fetch captain von Degerfeldt She is completely exhausted. She is fighting for her husband.Poor woman. So,what do you think? Horrid job,isn't it? Mrs von Degerfeldt Try to calm down I will give you time to reflect and then you will surely tell us everything. It will be a relief for you. -Maud! -Rutger! Aren't you ashamed of torturing a poor innocent woman! Calm down.Calm down I just played a few tones from East of Suez for her.. That made a certain impression. You are playing hits in a room where recently a man has died.. and forces cultivated people to listen! Your wife has admitted that you both were here yesterday. We also know that she played for the dead man. You are lying.This is a clumsy attempt of trapping me. Hugo von Degerfeldt had withdrawn 15000 kronor from the bank which we found here in the drawer They did not have a connection with the two bills you were to reissue today? I don't need to borrow money. My firm is solid. Your accountant seems to be of a different opinion. For your wife's sake you should not prolong this. At least admit that she did not lie.. when she said that you were here yesterday OK. You can understand that it is a bit unpleasant for me to admit that we were here yesterday We were negotiating a loan, which, by the way, did not materialize, but then we left at 800 pm. Now I don't want to hear any more lies What happened during that.. half hour before your wife played I assure you,nothing happened. You killed Hugo von Degerfeldt with this spanner it was from the sport car. I have never seen that spanner before. It could belong to another car. Yes.Somebody else could have placed it there I have never seen it You are lying!That spanner belongs to your brother's car.The spears fit into the wound. Microscopic investigations has shown that von Degerfeldt was killed with this. I am innocent.I have not killed anyone. You cannot believe that you would kill a relative and then sit down and play the piano! -I am not a killer. -Have you nothing more to say? This might be the last time you will see your husband. -My husband is innocent!It was me killing with the spanner! -Maud, you are not shutting up in the presence of this riff-raff.You ought to.. It is the truth!I killed him! I am the guilty one! -Maud -You see that she needs help! She is exhausted by the tension. Bring her to the police station and call for a doctor We will continue tomorrow. Are you going to continue with this torment tomorrow? If you are not immediately setting us free.. an accident will occur! Try to calm down,Captain! Please sit down When you have confessed you will feel better. -You can't imagine what a relief it will be.-She is innocent! You cannot believe that she is innocent As long as you are not confessing I have to suspect her! It is possible that an honest confession from you would save your wife. despite her confession. No, you are not getting me!! You will not get me in jail Aren't you ashamed of creeping behind a woman who is sacrificing herself? it is both unworthy and mean. Mean? Did you say mean? Your devil! I will teach you not to insult an officer! Let me go!Let me go! Well? This was not so nice? Then you don't envy my job? You might learn something for the future to have more respect for the life. You might even be generous with your compassion for your unhappy fellow-creatures -Who are you? -I am constable Redlund. I will just speak to the inspector Lilja. Well,in that case you have to wait. He is not here. I can't wait I have important information to give Yes,but you can easily speak with me, when the inspector is away. What is the matter? It deals with the murder of Degerfeldt! Please tell me what you know. We are just dealing with it. -Write down...Alma Sofia Evelina Furuvik -Mrs? Miss! Alma Sofia Evelina Furuvik living in S:t Paulsgatan 16, Maria parish, Stockholm. And I declare that the murder of Hugo von Degerfeldt.. was not committed at all with a spanner as you think -But with a poker! -How can you so sure about that? How can I know it! Here is the murder weapon! -Do you mean...? -Yes! here is the guilty one. Arrest me!Sentence me! you cannot come like this and state such a thing from the thin air You are not saying that I am a liar? No,of course not but you need to explain further into details about the motive? I hate all men Yes I understand.It is not a reason to commit a murder. Yes for me.And I demand my sentence. But dear Miss Furuvik are you here again? You promised me never to come back. This time this is really true! Please dear inspector! This time this is really true! I have to make amends for my crime. We have not got time for you. You'll have to leave. -Remember what I told you last time -I know that I am guilty! I must have my punishment. I cannot live without my punishment. I will be mad unless I get my punishment... -I will be mad!! -Please go away now ,Miss Furuvik. My poker!Are you going to steal it? The poker.Let me get it. Please.Just leave now. -Poor woman! How do you become like that? -It was a tragic story. There was a scoundrel who had to leave for abroad so she became shy and left the opera She was in the chorus. She started to live on cocking toffee And then she got pathological sense of guilt She has been running here the last years claiming responsibility for all sorts of crime A heavy wandering.. We should really not believe the worst. Have you looked into the files of Furuvik? Yes.Now she wants to be a murderess,poor soul The strange thing is that her confession seems to be true this time around It seems that she really had a relationship with the dead man Alma Furuvik as the guilty... That would be an extraordinary solution -Good bye. -Are you leaving? I have other things to attend Well I suppose nothing more is left than to confine her somewhere But there is lack of space. Even for the mad ones Blessed the one making her company.... The reality is as mad as the dream of the lunatic What is it? Please let him wait a moment. What a blow this must have been for him It is the most touching to see a hard man being crushed. My God,if I could avoid the nearest half-hour You have a nice profession as a doctor and avoid being a executioner. We will send for Mrs von Degrfeldt when.. she has recovered enough to continue. I gave her a sleeping pill last night. To imagine oneself in the eternity- -and then wake up at the police headquarter - well I'll be blowed! Please,Lord Justice. Have you been called upon to arrest my son.. and my daughter-in-law? Yes I am not doubting that you think you have done your duty-- -but..one could make mistakes. Naturally.And in the end it is always for the court... I have this morning received this letter. It is a woman called Alma Furuvik, who claims to be the murderess. Yes,she has already been here. But she really had a reason to revenge Hugo von Degerfeldt I know that she was his mistress- -and he deceived her as with all others Don't you think it could have been an act of revenge? I am sorry to say that we cannot take into consideration at all this poor woman's confession The daughter-in-law of the Lord Justice has confessed the murder. Could she be capable of such a sacrifice that pleasure seeking doll? She wants to sacrifice everything for your son A strange woman I cannot understand that you can be so adamant sure The Lord Justice must face the reality There are very few things in your son's favour indicating innocence My sorrow. I have tried to catch at a straw I hoped that that you had been mistaken I have tried to deceive myself but deep in my heart I knew that everything would tumble down oh,bless the one without sons I am sorry. Can I speak with the arrested? Sorry, Lord Justice, but it is impossible during interrogations in process... You misunderstand me I just want to try to get him to confess-if he is guilty Captain von Degerfeldt. As the matter is I cannot even with best of intentions.. ..allow a conversation between four eyes I hope the Lord Justice understand me Yes,hit me!Like many times before... If you are guilty, Rutger, then confess,confess! So you are helping each other to get me to confess? Listen to me just once, Rutger. You think I am hard but at heart I am weak. I wanted to stop the dissolution of the family I am submitting myself to iron discipline in order for my sons to infuse the spirit to keep our name elevated. By forcing and commanding! It is possible that there is some justification in your desperate protests against my severity But now I am punished. My position,my life,crushed. So you realize in the end that it was not only my fault I ask you Rutger,if not for my sake, than for the sake of your sister Maria Do not break her down. If your guilty,confess,confess! Do not make this drama worse than it already is by also being a coward. I am not a coward! I have done everything to show that I am not a coward! Why are you still tormenting him? When you know that he is innocent. Do you think that I will retract my confession? -I am not retracting anything! -She is brave! -Do you hear, Rutger.She is brave. -He is innocent! Quiet, Maud. I am the guilty one.She can leave I alone is the guilty one. This is not true! He only says so to save me! I do not want you to go to prison for my sake,Rutger! Shut up! Do you think I would allow a woman to sacrifice herself for me? I killed him, and I am responsible for it. I will not allow my wife to mix into my settlement with the justice Let her go! Take me into custody.. So I can receive my judgment So you are really a murderer! My son - a murderer! No,I am not a murderer, although I happened to kill a human being. How could you kill a human being? In this case I only did the society a favour. As an aviator I have lost the respect for the death Many of my comrades are already dead It is such a devilish stupid idea that a human life means something Such miserable quibbling! You have killed,my son! Don't you understand that you are a murderer! You banished your brother for a few thousand kronor! I killed what was left of him. I could not see any other solution. It is my fault forcing him to do it. I have been crazy for amusements and clothes! It is me who has driven him in front of the Lord. You are living like a madman and then you kill a sick man from behind! Yes.I hit him.I am not a coward! You hit and crushed your own and your father's life. It is you who destroyed my life! I had to make a rebellion! I became an aviator because you did not want that. I threw money to the winds because you were mean. I became in love with Maud because you detested her I became a murderer because you were a judge! It was your damned authority I killed! Try to calm down Captain von Degerfeldt. We must get a clarification of the direct cause for your actions. I could have got money from uncle Hugo. He wanted to humiliate us -by lending me money when my father had refused. Then you came and destroyed everything. Hugo became like a devil when you wanted him exiled for the second time! You should have heard him laugh derisively when he refused me the money.. which he had locked in the drawer I run down to my wife in the car.I thought... ..she could plead with him Then I grabbed the spanner to make it possible to break up the drawer Your wife could also not influence him? No.He just stared at me with that strange cheating stare.. which just inspired to beat him. He could not provoke a violent action from you. It does not fit with his desire for revenge. It fits very well standing here. Is that not a revenge! Oh,he was so disgusting a man could ever be. Is that not true, Maud?. "You dare not give him what he deserves" something shouted in me "You are a cowardly wretch who dare not give him what he deserves" -At the same time fell the blow. -Rutger,Rutger! It was like I was not acting on my own I almost did not know what had passed. What happened then? I woke up when my wife threw herself beside me. For a long while we just stood still and heard our hearts pounding.. Nothing worried me now that Maud did not condemn me. Why was it not me who killed him? Why! And then? I asked my wife to play something at the piano. in the case the neighbours had heard something She was so courageous that I cried. During the mean time I managed to break up the drawer... ..and found the personal guarantees The morphine bottle I placed on the table in order to deflect the suspicions. I thank you for your confession. We will do a protocol.. as soon as possible which you need to sign Then your sentence could be ready within three weeks. -Your wife will be released.. -No.I don't want to be set free! The Lord Justice might take care of Mrs von Degerfeldt. We have now other outstanding errands.. No,not him,he will mock Maud. He taught me to hate myself. There must be someone else to take care of her. Do you hate me like that? I am your father. So you are my father. Father to this criminal. Can't you understand me? Can't you forgive me? Forgive? Should I forgive you? Everything is finished. Everything is crushed. What sense make severity? We have to forgive each other. Should I forgive you? Yes.Forgive me, Rutger. I did not know that you could have a hell as well. It is so strange to see you broken,Dad. It was always like a spasm in me when I thought about you. If I only once had seen you despaired,Dad. If you had cried a little when mother died- -maybe this would not have happened Good bye, Rutger. I cannot stand it anymore. Good bye Dad It is a pity we did not meet while I was alive. Hans is sitting outside.He will take care of Maud and take her to her mother. Now Mrs von Degerfeldt has to leave us - we have lots of work here to do Pull yourself together, Maud.I don't want you here.This is no place for a lady. Hans, you are coming in the right moment.. -Hello, Rutger. - Hello, Maud. Thus is the real misfortune... A naked,blind and unpainted destiny. You have to take care of Mrs von Degerfeldt. She needs further medical treatment after this shock. I don't want to.I want to stay with you. Maud... Maud! Take care of her, Hans. You should fly with her where there is warmth and spring,do you understand? Keep her beautiful.You should dance with her.She has to dance. You are trying to be brave as long as possible until it breaks. -I am not a coward. -No.You are brave. You are the bravest man I know. I will fly,I will dance,I will be brave. The whole time I will think of being brave. You are right,Maud, you have understood me. Keep your head, my girl.. Goodbye, Maud. -well,well... -Yeah! It feels strange that Maud has been away for such a long time. Dare we show our happiness? My dear,do you think it will help with such a display. No.Hardly. -Hello! Welcome! -Hello! -God,how lovely to hug you again! -You should greet me too! -Welcome! -Ladies first! Thanks,sister. -"Welcome"! It sounds really touching. -Is this all luggage? -I will only stay for a few days. -But ,you,Hans,we will have you for a time? Yes.I have no home,house or domestic hearth. ..so you better prepare the cavalier apartment I will help you Yes.Now you have seen the whole business the hospital and the small world we live in. Yes.Lots.Despite the sick persons and all, how lovely and quiet you have. You must understand this is the real life -Do you envy us? -No. I am not really part of the life. I am standing beside. I am broken,Maria.Sometimes though it seems rather pleasant to be broken. I visited your Dad. He must have suffered. I do not think he understood how much he cared for Rutger. Poor Rutger, a wild bird in a cage. -I am going to open that cage. -What did you say? Nothing.How big are the snowflakes. Maria,do you think there is peace anywhere? For everybody? Yes For everybody? Yes,for everyone. What is this?Is it from Italy? Yes.It is from Italy. Hans? Hello Are you up so early? How strange to say Good Morning. Yes.I can imagine that. Have you slept well? Like this!I have slept like a pig. Do you know, I should really.. buy a farm and stay there -Yes.That would be healthy! -If only the cows did not smell so horribly! -Please sit down -Thanks How long will you stay with us? I hope you will not leave us soon? As you understand I have painted a lot and I will try to arrange an exhibition in the future. Red canaries in gothic cathedrals? No.Chagall disgusts me with his painting -What is your impression of Maud? -She doesn't look well. -There behind.. -There Why did she return home suddenly? Well,you understand one evening in Firenze when we were strolling around without any aim as you do sometimes Suddenly she spots the Medicis's coat-of arms on PalazzoVecchio,as you know. I darted out something stupid as usual saying I had an idea for a painting Don Giovanni should give poisonous pills for his mistresses.... Bernard! Maud has gone!She hasn't touch the bed. She must have left last night. "Dear Maria! It was wonderful to see you so happy and content" "I believe also that there is peace for us all and hope to meet you where we all are free" Where we all are free How strange... Please sit down He will be here soon. Don't be so nervous,the lady is really eagerly awaited. One arrives here dressed in mourn but I am not like that neither he. Maybe so but please sit down and calm down. And the lady must think about the regulations. You have to sit on each side of the table and no touching of prisoners, I think it is the best that I take care of the handbag. There are so many trying to smuggle in things for the inmates. -Why is he not coming? -He will soon be here.Soon be here. It is me..... Look you should be seated on each side of the table.You have a quarter of an hour I will interrupt the conversation immediately if there is something unsuitable These are the regulations. I look terrible.You are only allowed to shave one a week. How is it, Rutger? How are you? I am suffocated slowly like a rat in a hole! No,I don't believe it.! It is not true. You will not be broken. If I only could get into an airplane... and crush into a mountain!! It only says crush.. I would like 139 to pay attention that this is not a language appropriate within the walls of a prison It is also incumbent on prisoners to show remorse over their crime and the will to expiate for their crime Rutger,why did not you let me come before? It feels like an eternity. I did not want you to see me like this I wanted you to forget me!! There is no hope. I will never leave this place. Penal servitude for life God,how beautiful you are,Maud! I wanted to be like this for you today like in old times.You used to like it. At nine o'clock the light is shut out. Do you understand? I am lying in the darkness possessed by you. I am wearing off my nerves... Such a misery! Such a damned misery! You should just wait a little,Rutger, and everything should be fine. I have been to your Dad,and we had it out.He will die in peace. Could he understand this? Could he forgive? He understood and we had got the will to reconcile I can't feel it like that. Help me,Maud! -But Rutger I have come because of that! -Tell me then! Help me, Maud! Just feel the peace I have experienced. Feel it Then you will know the essential thing is not the life but the faith. -Faith? -Yes,faith.Faith, Rutger! If we have faith, then you will see that we can continue to live without doing it. -More! More! -"Don't look so startled, darling"... Please only swedish here.. otherwise it is my duty to immediately interrupt the conversation. Excuse me.I forgot it. -The time has not finished? -No, there is some minutes left. I don't understand anything.Why was I born and why have I lived? -You are looking at my locket,Rutger? -Your locket? It belonged to my grandmother. My grandfather was shot and the bullet which killed him she always carried in this locket. Do you understand? She always carried death with her. -Your locket. -Listen,Rutger You see Hans told me in Firenze-- -that the Renaissance man also used lockets for their bullets Hans said that the Renaissance men was the first.. modern people like we,Rutger Maud, I really like that locket. Please, Constable can you fetch my handbag. I only want my handkerchief. I suppose crying is allowed. Do you remember the story about the two small bullets? I will tell you. No,you do not need to do that,Maud Thanks If you have anything important to say hurry up There are only a few minutes left. Could the constable just go to the window. We might not see each other again. It is really against regulations... But at the same time And then we look each other in the eyes the whole time.. Now there will be .. no point of return. You will see everything will be fine... If I only could hold your hand.. To think that you came and helped me... Thanks.Maud You will see that we will wake up where there are no walls.. I do not want to wake up any more .In my heart I have always felt tired. You must will, for my sake. I want us both to live..... ...forever... What is the matter?Is the lady ill? Maud, you can't go before me .I don't want to be left behind.. Maud! SUBTITLES BY SEGLORA
