When is the auction? These girls will be sold in Meshed. They go today in Osman Aga's caravan. Dye and trim the beard. As you say. Is this your caravan that just arrived from Meshed? Tell me. Is there talk about the marriage of our Princess Fawzia with your prince? There are always fools who believe that happiness will follow when the prince marries. So there is much talk. There is much talk that such a marriage would help trade. I always say I like Baghdad for a visit, but not to live there. I love to go there to eat and for the entertainment and the fakirs. What's this I hear, Kerbelai?? Is Hajji leaving us? Alas, great day to our great Chief Executioner. This is the very day. Tis not enough for a son to follow in his father's footsteps. Oh, he can put a man to sleep or keep a man awake a week, all with those skillful fingers. Why are you not satisfied to be like your father, Hajji? You're a good barber. True. But why, I ask myself, must I remain a barber? Take the Shah's chief favorite, Ismael Beg the golden, IS he more handsome or better spoken than 1? But he is the favorite. Well, and, the famous lord treasurer who filled the king's coffers with gold, he does not forget his own. What was he, the son of a grocer? Eats and drinks what he likes. He puts on a new coat every day. And after the shah, he has his choice of all the beauties of Persia. Surely, one as handsome as you has no trouble with the beauties. I have no trouble with, I have trouble getting to. I'll put money on Hajji, he'll make his way. One hundred dinars that in six months Hajji is still a barber. Make it 500, and I'll take it. Hajji is the kind of young man who gets ahead in our country. Done. Five hundred dinars. - Thank you, noble merchant. - Succeed, and I'll thank you. Since you leave today, Hajji, you're welcome to a place in my caravan. The greatest caravan to leave Ispahan. You had better be well-armed, Osman Aga. This is a risky time. Fortunately, we did not encounter the fierce tribes, but my Uncle Aziz was not so lucky. Two days before me, he was attacked at the Great Pass at Meshed. Oh, for a merchant, there's always risk. Remember, Hajji, there's safety in numbers. I prefer to travel alone. As you wish. Tell me, Hajji, you're a Baba, you hear everything. Who do you think the Princess Fawzia will marry? Achmed Khan or Nur-El-Din? Neither. But with a temper like hers, she must be already married to the devil. I must warn you, Hajji. You should not speak thus of our princess. If my noble master, the Chief Executioner, were to hear you, he would've you flayed alive. What have I said, that she is mean and cruel? I'd rather receive a kick from her than a kiss from most. Nay, laugh not. I may carry the instruments of a barber, but I have the desires of a prince.

And be slapped for my pains? No, let Shireen. Very well. Who will wake me and why? Is it you? Is it you? And why not you? Is it so difficult to decide? Very well, then. I will decide for you. You will wake me. And now that I am awake, for what have I been awakened? Joke. Your father, the Caliph, will be here much earlier than you expected. - When? - In a few minutes. - Rose of roses. - Princess of princesses. Is my bath ready, or do I have to choose someone to do that? Who is to bathe me and who is to dress me? Am I a lobster that you should boil me alive? Cool it. Cool it. Where is my perfume? Is it dead fish? Smell it yourself. Was ever a princess so cursed? The coffee is cold, and the bath is too hot. Meriam, are you going to torment me too? Princess, the bath is cooler now. Now it is too cold. Hurry, hurry. My father will be here, and I will not be ready. Again you have scratched me. Oh. Oh, my emerald. I wish to wear it. The Caliph, he is approaching. Then go quickly, all of you. Go. Out. Go, go. May I deserve my father's visit by my actions? It is my hope that your slumber was deep and your dreams pleasant. How can I sleep, knowing for the first time in my life I do not wish to obey? You've been a loving and a faithful daughter. For that reason, I've always given you everything you've wanted. But now I must refuse, only because I am fearful for your happiness. But you were fearful when I begged for the white stallion. You said he was dangerous. Then I rode him as I said I would and you admitted you were wrong. That is true. It is also true that the horse could only break your bones. Prince Nur-El-Din will break your spirit. See the ring he has sent me... and read the letters he has written. His words have no less fire. He desires me for his wife. Think of all the wives he's had and how he's treated them. No one can hold him. I am the one who can. Do you remember the Princess Mirza? She was as beautiful as you and as wise. And she was gentle as a dove. Perhaps he doesn't need a dove, but a falcon. You may be the falcon, but he will be the master. But, Father, Nur-El-Din will make me happy. I know he will. In all the East, there is no one as handsome as he. There's no greater warrior, nor one who rides as well or hunts as hard. - Or is as heartless. - But I will find his heart for him. - You are a child. - You are too old-fashioned. Would you take for a husband a man who sends your father a letter which says, Give her to me, or I will take her”? But that only shows how eager he is. He means no disrespect. You cannot cajole me. I say this man is not for you. He's evil. And I say he has the heart of a true prince. He desires me for his wife. I've sent messengers to Achmed Khan at Basra, to tell him that I'm sending you tomorrow to be his bride. Achmed Khan. Never. He's young and serious, and he's never been married. He's promised me he would build a mosque in your honor even more beautiful than the Taj Mahal. A mosque. Cold marble cannot make my blood stir but Nur-El-Din can and does. I fear for you. You are so innocent. Whose fault is that? Here I am 17 and unmarried. My sisters and cousins were married at 14. I have wasted three years, and I will waste no more. I will reason with you no further. Now I command you. I am the Caliph and your father. Make yourself ready for the journey. Tomorrow I send you to Basra to my friend and ally Achmed Khan. And I will send you under guard and in bonds if need be. - If I were a man, I would escape. - Perhaps there's a way. I have a message from Nur-El-Din. You have? I am as nothing in his eyes, only a pathway down which his voice may travel to your ears. Joke. Do you know the avenue of Aberan that is left unguarded? Only one parasang from the outside of the city, there is a well and some trees. At that place, a horseman awaits, a beardless youth. - And for clothing? - Not yet. I received the message only this morning.

I hear these escaped harem girls are creatures of delicate beauty. Do not be misled, young man. They're beautiful, yes... and dressed enchantingly. But they are sirens, cold. Their hearts are filled with hatred. They rode up out of the hills like, like demons and rode us down. Those of us who were not killed in the fighting... were hung up for vultures. I was, I was left for dead... with this sash knotted around my neck. Your words only sharpen my interest. Such women must be very exciting. I merely wish to emphasize a warning, young man.

Your curiosity is greater than mine. With luck, we'll overtake a merchant caravan. By the might of Allah. Stand. Relax. We are two weary travelers who wish to join your number for the journey to Meshed. - Take us to your leader. - Dismount and follow me. Here. By Allah, if it isn't my old friend Hajji Baba. Inshallah, Osman. And who is this one? This youth is Shir Ali, my assistant and apprentice to the arts of barbering. You move rapidly towards success. This morning you were little more than an apprentice yourself. Can you give us shelter? - Find shelter for my friend Hajji Baba. - It shall be done. You refuse me in the morning only to join me at night. - How is it you go to Meshed? - I now see a chance for a fortune there. Ah, perhaps, perhaps not. Everything is in the hands of Allah. So be it. Can I count on your mercy for food for myself and Shir Ali? Most assuredly, but first, you shall give me a massage and then you shall share food and, other pleasures. Fetch me the copper bowl. Fill it with water, heat it and bring it here. Fetch it yourself. Allah has cursed me with an apprentice with the disposition of a mule. Aye. Can we contend with fate? If Allah make a camel white, can Osman Aga make it black? Hey, what is your talent, youth? Are you skilled in the massage of Astrachan or the trimming of the beard? He is superb in the massage. Can he by a slight pressure on certain nerves put me into a full slumber as you can? He is my apprentice in all things. Good. Then I shall strip, and your hands shall melt away all aches from my bones. And later on, you shall take me into the mess... I will fetch the water, master. Ah-ah. Ah... - Where is the dancer? - I shall send for her. This is my good friend, Hajji Baba, and his apprentice Shir Ali. This is the Chaoush Mandan, who has promised us protection from the dreaded Turcomans. Boy, fetch my pipe. Send in the dancer. I have a cargo of silks from Constantinople and slave girls from Meshed. This dancer is a jewel who might please a prince like Nur-El-Din. What manner of man is this prince? Nur-El-Din? Fortunately for me, he's fickle. His desires wax and wane like the moon. He is to marry the Princess Fawzia. Is there any slave girl to compare with her? Yes, there is one. This dancer Ayesha. She is beyond compare. She is more to be desired than ten princesses. - But I hear that Princess Fawzia... - And as beautiful. Ah, yes, I've heard so too. But as you, yourself, said this morning, she's cruel and selfish. And I have it from one of her handmaidens that she's not even beautiful. Her mouth is large, she has no salt in her complexion. She's crooked. As for her waist, it is that like of an elephant. And her feet, a camel has smaller. - That is a lie. - Have you seen the princess, oh, youth? He is at an age where all princesses are beautiful. May I retire, oh, master? No, boy. Come sit by me and watch the dancer. It is as Hafiz has said. Every moment of pleasure that one enjoys, a count has gained. Ah, the musicians. What do you think of her? She is magnificent. - What do you think? - I have seen better. Why do you not join the others? Fatigue lies heavy upon me. You did not enjoy the dance. At least I learned what manner of woman a barber finds beautiful. She is beautiful. And I venture your Nur-El-Din will find it so. Never. Her skin is coarse like pumice, her legs are too thick, her waist would take a bridge to span it. Some say that of the Princess Fawzia. Barber, you are fortunate that we are not in Ispahan, - or I would've you... - Have me flogged? That is your answer to all but flattery. You wish to silence everyone by threats. Is that what it is to be a princess? Go. I am weary. Move over. You cannot stay with me. Then leave. This is my tent. You will not take advantage of me. I have the courage to kill you and myself if need be. When I think of a woman, I think of Ayesha. You are safe with me. I've had a hard day, and I need no blows to put me to sleep. Disrobe, if you will. I shall count a hundred stars. - Where's the princess? - She's safe. - Bring her to me. - No. I'm taking her to Nur-El-Din. She is my charge, and I do not need you. Nor I. Do not be alarmed. I wish merely to speak to you. - Where is your master? - He'll be back. I will make a bargain with you. I know that you are not Shir Ali, neither am I Chaoush. Who are you? An honorable spy in the service of your father, the Caliph. And you are the Princess Fawzia. Hajj. Hajji? Hajji? Hajj. Hajj. Hajj. If it had not been for your courage, I would be back in Ispahan this day. You're precious to me, worth an emerald ring and a hundred golden dinars. That is why you risked your life? Well, what else? The emerald alone is worth 20,000 tomans. With that, I can buy everything. Horses, houses, slaves and love. There is some love you cannot buy. Only in legends. Perhaps you are right. Perhaps legends are for barbers and love for princesses. You will get Nur-El-Din, and I will get the emerald. We shall see who has the better bargain. Now, Barber, I have found you, I have caught you, and I will kill you. No. I will speak to my father on your behalf. You will not see your father, Princess. My orders are to take you straight to Basra. No. Prince Achmed Khan rides from Basra to meet us. I must see my father. There is need for great haste. We will take the short way through the great mountain pass. I know you are tired, Princess, but we must continue. We must get over this pass before nightfall. Do what you wish. Your plans are not mine. Guards, alert. This road is watched by Turcoman women. Get them, get them. Turcomans. The Banah returns. Come on, come on, come on. Move along, move along. Sell him in Bokara. And bring in the next. This is the leader of the caravan, Great Banah. Allah is with us. I'll capture the Caliph's guard, and you take the caravan. Leave me at least one diamond. These rings are all I have left in the world, and I'm an old man. Sell him in Bokara. Who is next? Can you ride and use a knife? I conquer men in other ways. Well said. To women of courage, we give a choice. Stay with us, or we will sell you in Bokara to the highest bidder. I wish to be sold in Meshed to Nur-El-Din. Then you are not for us. You Will be sold in Bokara. Take her. Who is the next one? I offer this emerald as my ransom. That is my emerald. Leave him. Why is it in his possession? He is my apprentice. It is in safekeeping. - What say you? - The emerald is mine. What do you offer for your life”? This ring and my skill. Let me see the ring. This is Nur-El-Din's ring. Are you his man? No, I stole the ring. My name is Hajji. I'm from Ispahan. I have the skills of a barber. I bleed, pull teeth, set limbs. You have need of me. I can heal you. I do have need for you. And my apprentice, Shir Ali? If you heal me, I will spare you both. If not... Perhaps it is because I am weak from my wound. But I wish, if only for a few minutes, to be a woman. What is there to stop you? Who are you? I was forced into the harem of Nur-El-Din. But as you have seen, I am not meant to be any man's slave. The moon is not more beautiful than you. In a conflict of wills, man has force on his side. Nur-El-Din taught me pain. I hate him. You escaped? Yes, with two other girls. Our fame spread, and now whenever any woman escapes slavery, she comes to us. And are you happier now? I prefer to choose rather than be chosen. Is it possible I am the first one you have chosen? Would that it were so? Where are the others? In my harem. And where is that? They rot in the sun... once their ardor cools. Mine will increase with each passing day. What is the meaning of this? Look for yourself. Who is she? The Princess Fawzia of Ispahan. The Caliph's daughter? And what is she doing here? I was taking her to her betrothed, Prince Nur-El-Din. You can forget that you were in my arms five minutes ago. For it will not save you if you lie to me. As Allah as my witness, it is the truth. I promise to take her to Nur-El-Din in return for that emerald you wear. And she means not else to you? It is a matter of trade. Like transporting sheepskins. You should ask me what he means to me. He is a servant that I bought as I would buy any other. Spoken like a princess. But that does not prove that you are one. Do any of you know the Princess Fawzia? I do. I was her handmaiden. - Fabria. - Yes, I am Fabria. And she is the Princess Fawzia. She is in your keeping. I will show her how well I learned my lessons. Whatever she does to you, will be better than you could expect from Nur-El-Din. You, I will spare for your gentle hands. But I warn you, if you communicate with her in any way, both of you will die. Great Banah. We have prepared to take the slaves to Bokara. We wait for your command. Go. Mercy, please. I'll show you mercy the same as you showed me. - Hajji. - Drink. I was frightened.

Only one. That I find myself tied to this pole. You regret having tried to bring me to Nur-El-Din? No. But I do. Since I know I will not live, I must speak the truth. I do not wish to marry Nur-El-Din. For in these past days and nights, I have learned something. I've learned that I've been mean and cruel. That I love you. I have learned the same for myself. Do you love me more than an emerald? More than 10,000 emeralds. It is easy to say now. For you will never see an emerald again. I would not now give you to Nur-El-Din or any other man alive. If Nur-El-Din would've even looked at you, I would gouge out his eyes. If his hand touched you, I would break it. By the beard of Allah, I swear it. Hajji. Great Prince. We have defeated the Turcoman women. And here is their leader. My old love, the Banah. I would think you would've died rather than be delivered to me. Kneel and beg my forgiveness. Musa. Put her in chains with her followers. Wait. Where did you get this ring? I will tear the words out of you. I can answer that, Great Prince. I know from whence the ring comes. Release her. It belongs to the Princess Fawzia, who was a captive in the Turcoman camp. Princess Fawzia? Captain. Take your fleetest horses. Ride to the Turcoman camp and bring back the princess. Five hundred dinars to the man who delivers her safely. Hurry. Praise to Allah, they live. Quickly. Fair cousin, you must think ill of me as a ruler. I beg your forgiveness that I have been unable to protect you from such shameful treatment. I am grateful, Prince, to you and your men for my life. May I secure you from all danger in the future? First there is something you must hear. Hajji will tell you. Hajji, tell the prince. Tell him what happened. Great Prince, here is the scoundrel who tried to steal the maiden Morgiana from your harem. I want him here in front of me. The law is clear. And mine is the hand of justice. All right, now. I want you to tell me what happened. Well, we were latched to a pole, Great Prince. We could not move. And I was bemoaning the fact that after many dangers have been overcome, it looked as if I might not be able to deliver the princess to you as I'd hoped. I made every effort to bring her to you safe and sound. And now... Now I claim my reward. The brave lion has become a lamb. It is not enough. He speaks the truth. I promised him the emerald you wear. Give it to him. A bargain is a bargain. He shall have the emerald. You are a true prince. And I love you. Leave him a horse. A bargain is a bargain.

I'll give you a chance to double your money, no, triple it... in the shortest possible time. I leave immediately with a great caravan of goods to be sold at Nur-El-Din's wedding. As you know, he marries the Princess Fawzia a few days hence. I will not go. Oh, I do not ask to take you, but your money. No. Money has not brought me happiness. Twice the money will not make me happier. Nor thrice. But what ails you, Hajji? I am in love. Oh, then buy her. Whatever the cost, it's worth it. No, she is not for sale.

It is the key to my future. A bitter future. You would be hated, not loved. I do not need love if I have possession. I have ways to persuade you to do my bidding. - Could you be forced into submission? - No. Neither can I. You're wasting your time. We are a race of kings, and we do not surrender easily. I will make this arrangement with you. Do as I ask, and once I have accomplished my purpose, I will give you your freedom. What purpose is that? I intend to possess all Persia. My armies have gone as far as south as Karwan, and as far north as Samarcand. Ispahan lies across the trade route, from Basra to Baghdad and Tehran. Ispahan, I must and shall have. You say must. I say never. Come with me. This amber-colored liquid... So warm, so full of fire. Would you believe that in an instant it could chill the marrow of your bones? Turn your blood to ice so rapid, that you need but taste it? And yet, it is merciful. Like this one. Color of an emerald. The emerald I gave to you, which you, in turn, gave to another. This works slowly. Twenty, 30 hours. It looks cool, like the ocean at its deepest point. And would you believe it sets every nerve on fire that one cannot breathe? That one does not know whether the agony in the hands. IS worse than the feet”? Or the chest worse than in the vital organs? Horrible. So it is. And I dread its use. But two slight months ago, I gave it to my friend Amir Kalim. He broke his word, and it broke my heart to watch his agony. I think you will be the most beautiful bride Persia has ever seen. You are Hajji Baba? I am, Great Caliph. You are the one who took my daughter against my will and transported her to Nur-El-Din. No one transports your daughter, Highness. I accompanied her. In the four days and four nights I was with her, I found her difficult, spoiled, ill-tempered, and mean. You love her. Love her? One might as well love a storm on the desert. Or an angry camel, or the bite of a spear. Girl, tell Hajji Baba what you told me. The princess implores the Caliph, her father, not to come to the wedding. She says it is enough that she is in danger. The princess says that Nur-El-Din will kill the Caliph if he comes. She begs her father's forgiveness for disobeying him and for not heeding his warnings. She asks him to find Hajji Baba and thank him for what he tried to do. My armies could never defeat Nur-El-Din in the desert. Besides, I must keep them here to defend Ispahan. But, Hajji, sometimes one man... What could I do? What could a barber do against a powerful prince? Do you love my daughter? Love her? I am a barber's son. Muhammad himself was not born a prince. And it was he who said the greatest power in the world is love. Nur-El-Din's strength can crumble and fade away, but the power of love survives. I say to you, if you love my daughter, you have that power. Win her. Spices from Samarcand. Shawls from Cashmere. Silks from Bokara. Filigree from Damascus. Fine mosaics. Oh, patience. Patience, my doves. Wait. Turek. Take those into the tent. This is your caravan, merchant? It is. I have gifts for the prince and princess. And also many fabulous jewels. Will you please inform your master, Nur-El-Din, prince of princes, that I would show him my most precious gems. What is your name? My name is known throughout all Persia. I am the great merchant Osman Aga of Ispahan. And you? Who is he? This is a holy man. He is taken the vow of silence and of darkness. That's why he neither speaks nor uncovers. Praise be to Allah. Turek, make all ready within the tent. Wait, wait, wait. First, you must see what I have here. Oh. Ointments and salves. The finest in all Persia. Silks, perfumes, and jewels. More beautiful than any I ever saw. Where did the caravan come from? - Baghdad? - No, from Ispahan. It's the caravan of the great Osman Aga. I too, wish to go. But I'm afraid to leave the princess. Go. Go, all of you. I will wait. These salves and ointments are made from secret formulas ages old. In one of these jars of ointment, there is a precious jewel. A diamond worth a hundred tomans. The lucky girl who finds the diamond may go into our tent and choose another gift. And remember, my lovelies, once again I remind you, the lucky one who finds the diamond, goes into the tent to choose another gift. Look. Look, the diamond. Ah. Fortunate one. Turek, take her into the tent. Don't go. There are more diamonds. More gifts. Hajj. You've risked your life RN. I hoped you would not forget me. How could I? Well, then, kiss me. Sweeter than honey, but I... I do not come for that. For what then? I'm on a mission for the great Caliph of Ispahan. To rescue his daughter, the princess. For a rich reward. If you help me, Nur-El-Din will be yours alone. No. You Know, that except for the Princess Fawzia, you are far most favorite IN his eyes. Help me and he will be yours. You will rule by his side. You will have the jewels, the robes, the power that Nur-El-Din would give the princess. What is it you would've me do? Osman Aga has brought with him an offering for the guards. It is a potent mixture of pomegranate juice and honey. You will serve it to the guards surrounding the Turcoman women. No. I'm afraid. I swear to you, it will not hurt the guards. What is in this liquid? Ah, beautiful dreams. You see? It is not deadly. If you desire a prince, you must've courage. The rewards you promise are to my liking. - I will do as you ask. - Good. Then take this to the guards. I will. When will they drink it? At noon. Please. Please, will you take me to Ispahan with you? It's very important. Oh, have no fear. This Turek cannot speak, and therefore can be trusted. At noon”? Good. Now will you do as I ask? Will you take me with you when you go to Ispahan? Will you hide me? I might. I will see that you are richly rewarded. I have an ancient prejudice against promises. Here. This is a measure of what you might expect in Ispahan. To hear is to obey. But tell me, how does a lad like you, a mere barber's apprentice, find himself with such a pearl? It, it was a gift. I did the Princess Fawzia a service. And how is the princess? Is she happy over her marriage to Nur-El-Din? How can she be happy when she loves another? She does? And who may that be? His name is Hajji Baba. Hajji Baba? I had no idea that your master Hajji even knew the princess. The last time I saw him in Ispahan, he was surrounded by beautiful slave girls. I hear he's even thinking of buying a charming girl for a wife. No. - Oh, it cannot matter to you. - Of course not. As for myself, he treated me ill. I was speaking before on behalf of the princess. How is it that the Princess Fawzia loves a barber? Because she is a fool. Ah. It is not wise to speak thus of Nur-El-Din's bride. Turek, take this lad into our tent and show him our wares. And hide him there. Thank you, noble merchant. Ah, praise be to Allah. I must go see Prince Nur-El-Din. For noon is not far distant. Tell me, lad, what matter of jewel does the princess like? Emeralds. Ah, she has excellent taste. Except in barbers. Where do I hide, Turek? Hajj. Osman Aga lies. For me, there are no women but you. Oh, Hajji, I'm so happy. But how is it you're here? You're in danger. I said on the rocks that you are more precious to me than any emerald. Now I shall prove it. No. Prove nothing. Only stay alive. I intend to. Our plan is simple. Osman Aga will keep Nur-El-Din occupied until noon. Then the Turcoman women will be released, and we shall escape. I have no need of pearls. Prince of princes, master of all Persia, your northern armies are poised for the attack on Basra. Your ally Alabel Shahzad sends this message. - 'We are ready.” - Great Prince, in the event your present plans fail, we are ready to march on Ispahan.” So be it. And now, great merchant of Ispahan, what else have you to show me? I have here a gift worthy only of your queen. This necklace once belonged to the queen of Sheba herself. What is the price of this necklace? It is impossibly expensive, noble prince. It is worth 100,000 tomans. Very well. I will pay you when I reach Ispahan. And I will remember you gratefully. Your esteem is worth more than great riches, noble prince. But if you could pay something, on account... These are truly wondrous gems. Never have I seen such well-matched stones. The princess will be enchanted. But, noble prince, this is but one of the beauties I have to show you. There are rubies which are like stars. Fantastic combinations of precious gems that have not been seen before. - 1 will see them another time. - But, noble prince, I beg of you. Be pleased to let me show them to you now. Let me show you some of my other treasures. Even better calculated to please a princess' taste. Wait here. Hurry. You must find the guards at once. It's almost noon. Do as I say. Go. Go quickly. And more for you? Praise be to... Praise be to whom? This is a gift from the caravan of Osman Aga. Then praise be to the generous merchant Osman Aga. Cool and refreshing, is it not? Happiness... Happiness and long life to our great prince. May Allah bless the marriage of our prince to the Princess Fawzia, and may their children be many, and may Persia rejoice in their rule. Wake up. Rise. Rise. Get up. Rise. Get up. Abdulah, make haste. Make haste. Come on. - Where is the princess? - I know not. Musa. Guards. - Find the princess. Bring her here. - Yes, Great Prince. Where is Musa? My sword. Be quick. Hajj. You have cheated us, Hajji Baba, of the privilege of taking him alive. Unfortunately, your troubles are not over. His men will now attack your city. I'll see the princess safely back and warn the Caliph's guard. We'll fight them off. Allah be with you. A great day for them and for me. The barber has his princess, and I shall have their trade. Their joys will be short, but yours may be many. That reminds me of our wager. Is Hajji a success or isn't he? A success? He has married the princess. He is worth more than all the merchants of Ispahan together. Do you call that success? Of course. What do you call it? Good fortune. An accident. Luck, that's all. Ah, Hajji's luck is your misfortune. Pay me. Aye. Five hundred dinars. Hey. Hajji. Good people. We thank you for your wonderful affection. However, the wedding ceremony has tired the princess. And I must regretfully take my leave. Allah be with you. They're magnificent. You're the idol of everyone, my love. I suppose I should make another appearance.
