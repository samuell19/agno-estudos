(Machine gunfire) - Where to, Uncle Sarge? - What's the bad news this time? Popeye found us a nice little ammo bunker to take out. Where's Mystery Man sending us this time? Red zone, Sector 2. Ooh! Hell, that's fine by me. I haven't been shot at in two days. - I'm starting to feel a little edgy. - I knew I smelled something! How the hell does the army think I'm gonna win the war when they gave me four bozos like you to hold me down? Sarge, don't worry. We're gonna be a comfort to you in your old age. - (Bill) Oh, I can hardly wait for that. - When do we get to meet this Popeye? What I wanna know is what the hell kind of name is Popeye for an intelligence officer? Hey, now, wait a minute. He sends you guys out there on shit jobs because you happen to be the best that there is. We just wanna meet the man. We're not gonna embarrass you. Right. Let's go. I told you we was a class bunch, Sarge. (Groans) We're almost on top of it now. Ray, take the point. Woody, Garrett, lead flanks. I'll be the back door. Joe, you hold out here. Oh, come on, Sarge, I want some of the fun. Just keep your eyes open. We get in trouble, you'll get all the fun you can handle. (Vietnamese voices in distance) (Speaking Vietnamese) Woody, how long to set up that bunker? Two maybe three minutes. (Bill) Ray, help pull the wire. Garrett, cover the front. I'll set the detonator. (Speaks Vietnamese) Slick. Slick! Hurry up, man. Cong to the north! Aargh! (Gunfire continues) (Shouting) Move out when I blow this. One of those gangs went after Rabinsky this morning. Burned up a bunch of sofas and chairs. All cos he didn't have the money. The Rollers, them gone and upped the ante again. Yeah, they told me I gotta pay $50 a week now instead of $25. We're barely making it at the cafe now. I know one thing, every dime I got is tied up in my laundromat. It's the same for all of us, Earl. At least the punks never take everything. They always leave us something. It's not right what these gangs are doing. A person needs just a little dignity. What should we do? We agree not to pay these gangs any more money. They can't beat up everybody. But, Joe, when they come to collect the money, what do we do then? We're gonna drive the gangs out of the neighbourhood? With what? Our good intentions? No, we're not soldiers, Joey. Sounds to me like we need to do some more thinking on this. This is the address. I've arranged the whole thing. It's a Smith & Wesson.38. You be sure and get maybe three boxes of shells. Are you sure this is right? Go on, get outta here. It'll do you good. Have yourself a nice bus ride downtown. Okay. I shouldn't be gone now more than a couple of hours. Ha! I love you, Pop. You sit next to a pretty girl on the bus for me, okay? (Chuckles) (Car approaches) Hey there, Joe! Oh, look, visitors! Get outta here, lady. Move, God damnit! Hey, Roy Boy... look what I see. Leave the woman alone, Roy Boy. She's a customer. Oh, my God. The story is... you've been trying to stir up trouble. We can't have that. (Gasps) See what can happen to one of your customers... ...when you don't pay your insurance? I think I'm in love. You bastards! I'll go first. You hold her. (Laughs) What's the matter, Jessie, you can't handle the foreplay? Oh, Jesus God. That's right. You better pray. You dumb son-of-a-bitch! Why'd you have to go waste a good piece of ass? (Jessie) She pissed me off. Now, I'm gonna have to teach you a lesson. (Screams) Your time's coming, Roy Boy. You count on it. The trouble is with people like you, you don't learn nothing, unless it's pounded... ...into your thick stupid head! Just pounded right into your stinking skull! Somebody talk to me! I can't believe it. Two people are butchered in there in broad daylight, and nobody saw anything. Talk? Why would anybody talk to you? When the punks are back on the street, they're gonna come looking for us! Where the hell were you when Joe Nace needed you? All right. Let's get it wrapped up and get outta here. Joe? Joe? Joe... Oh, my God... Joey! Thank you for coming, Mr Eckhart. Well, Joe saved my life in Nam. He saved the whole squad. Listen, if there's anything I can do, please... If you knew what they did to Joe... - Don't get caught up in it, Louie. - People should know! They took a meat hammer to him and hit him again and again and again... Mr Nace? Sorry, sir, that the circumstances of our meeting had to be like this. You know, Joe talked about you. So many times. He, uh... He said that you taught him how to fight. You wanna really do something for Joe? You teach us how to fight. Police ain't gonna find them punks that killed Joe. Nothing's gonna change. I don't even know what one man can do for us. I... I only know the stories that Joe told about you in the war. And... we got nowhere else to turn. Come on, Louie. Let me take you in. Popeye? Bill Eckhart. Yeah. Well, yeah, it has been a long time. No, no, no. I'm in Atlanta. Listen, you got a minute? I wanna call in a couple of favours. Marla... you know I gotta do this, don't you? We have a son now. Joe Nace, he saved my life. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for him. What about little Garrett's life? I'll be back. I love you. I love you too, baby. Here he is. Here they go. Come here. Great to see you, man. Great to see you. - Sarge. - Yeah. I really feel bad. I didn't think you were gonna give up your job for this. Well, now, who wouldn't wanna give up the many life-threatening hazards of the accountancy business for the security that you guys are offering? Uh, look, I do have just this one last case to get rid of. It will only take a second, and then I'm all yours. Okay? (Ray) Are you sure this is the place? (Bill) This is the place. This is what they told me. How's it going, brother? Hey, Ray. (Chuckling) Sarge. Flash-man Garrett. What's up? (Indistinct chatter) Hello, Lieutenant Hawkins. What's a hotshot from Metro doing down here? I've been assigned to that double homicide that happened down on Auburn Street last week. Well, we're always glad for the help, but between you and me, what the hell does Downtown care about a couple more killings in South Point? A couple more makes it, what, 16 in the last two years? Well, it's those gangs down there. The courts have our hands tied. - Nothing we do sticks. - Oh, I know how that goes. Anyway, count on me to do what I can. Well, you can use that desk in the corner. Okay. - Good luck. - Thanks. Do you like it? It's okay? It's okay, Louie. This is gonna make a perfect home base. You did real good. Okay, the next few days we're gonna need to just check things out. I'd like to get the people in the neighbourhood together so they can talk to us, meet us. Can that be arranged? You bet. I'll get started right away. Come on, Louie. - Oh, Bill. - Yeah? Thanks. - I'm gonna unload the van. - I'll come with you. - Are you gonna help? - No, I'm gonna supervise. Ray-Ray, you haven't changed a bit. Neither have you, man. Still ugly after all these years. When I got back from Nam... ...wasn't much left. My girl, job. Old gang, all gone. Even put a freeway through the old neighbourhood. You don't owe me an explanation. If a man can't fit, someplace, with somebody, ain't got much. You were the best, one of us. You're here now. That's good enough for me. Won't let you down, Sarge. I know you won't. (Tyres screech) Well, good day, Mr Walker. (Groans) Now, how many times do I have to tell you? You don't make your loan payments, you gonna get hurt. He ain't got nothing in there but this TV. Well, we'll take it. (Bill) I got someone who's gonna feed us information. I already got the rundown on these street gangs. These are the Scorpions. They're into strong-arm stuff and deal weapons. The Turks run most of the gambling and prostitution. Roy Boy Jagger and the Rollers. These guys call most of the shots down here. He's king of the hill. So, how many gangs are we talking about altogether? Well, three that control 90% of the action. (♪ Music over dialogue) (♪ Music over dialogue) (♪ Music over dialogue) This is the signal. Three sharp raps in a row. It's a call for help. It's also a sign of our unity. We're all in this together. - Whenever you hear this... - (Three raps) ...you all join in, okay? (Rattling) - Give me some. - Shit. Couldn't pick up nothing. We went to Stone's Garage, all these dudes started picking up wrenches and pipes and started tapping on the floor. And the next thing, about four guys came over from the bakery and they started doing it. That's the same thing that happened to me and CC. I mean, what the hell is going on? They wanna fuck with us... ...we'll fuck with them. Name's Lieutenant Hawkins. How'd you do? I'm told you fellas are new to the neighbourhood. Yeah, on vacation. You're a long way from the beach. Look, Lieutenant, we're just here visiting an old friend. Not looking for any trouble. Well, the fact of the matter is, that's my job. Looking for trouble. You see, somebody does something they're not supposed to be doing, no matter how right they think they are... ...that's trouble. You know, I hate people thinking they know the law better than the police. I know you from somewhere. (Ray) Oh? Do you follow the pro shuffleboard tour? Anybody here know these men? Huh? Then y'all have never seen them before? Lieutenant Hawkins, Captain wants to see you. Oh, Hawkins. Come on in. Close it. Take some advice. Don't go trying to win a medal so they'll kiss your ass Downtown. It doesn't work that way. I guess you're talking about my idea that you got vigilantes operating in South Point. You know as well as I do how the press loves to jump on even a hint of that kind of talk. I suggest you keep your theories to yourself and stick to collaring the punks responsible for that double homicide. Now, get out of here. (Roy Boy) Get a hold of them, tell them we're ready. Hey, dudes! Hey, what's happening? So, who are these new cats pissing up my neighbourhood? Never seen 'em before now. They just blew in, started pushing and shoving. You make 'em out for any kind of heat? Nah, they ain't no cops. They're something else, though. They're like... like the Four Musketeers. Hey, that's good. You know, I've been looking out for you guys cos in a couple of years you're gonna be Rollers. - Alright! - So next time these Mouseketeers pop up, I want you to let me know, okay? Just remember that I'm the guy that's looking out for your future. Hey, you got it, man. All right. Tell 'em where you got it, now. I'll catch you all later. Come on in. Everything's clear. We're all set to pick you up. Well, I'd say all in all we gained a lot of ground but... we're still not one red curly hair closer to whoever wasted Joe than the day we got here. Look, I know we all wanna even the score for what they did to Joe, but I think cleaning out the gangs, which is what he wanted, what he died for, is more important right now. Well, they're pretty well dug-in here. Yeah, well, the gangs are here because it's profitable. Now, somebody's making big bucks. Sounds like... like you've come up with something. Well, I don't have the whole picture yet, but there's a big operator in Columbia making drug runs through here. You know, I mean, these gangs may be some nasty little turds but I really don't think they're into big-league drugs. Yeah, well, you're partially right, Ray. They're not on the inside. South Point is only a warehouse for this combine out of Bogota. The gangs, they're paid for protection and cover. That way the people from the combine aren't here. What do you think would happen if one of their shipments got lost? So? Let's kick 'em in the pocketbook. Where do we start? We start with the Rollers, the Turks and the Scorpions. 'We eyeball 'em, day and night, 'find out exactly how they do it, everything. We go from there.' I was in the neighbourhood, thought I'd drop in for a cup of coffee. Okay. Tell me the truth. You come here for the atmosphere. Actually, you're right. I don't understand. You've always got a bottle. I'm sorry. - If it bothers you... - Why should you care if it bothers me? I just don't like to see you with that stuff all the time. (Commotion outside) - Hey, look what I got. - Oh, not my book. No, not my book. No! (Shouting continues) Please. Oh, leave me alone. Let go! Leave her alone. Yeah, beat it, punks! (Sobbing) You all right, ma'am? Yes. Yes, thank you. You see that? Elizabeth Barrett Browning. It's poetry. "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways" (Both) "I love thee to the depth and breadth and height" "My soul..." - I know who did it. - Who did what? I know who killed your friend. I saw him do it. Let's tail him. (Roy Boy) Let's get in and out fast. Be waiting for us around the back side, Doc. All those pus balls are in there together. No reason not to take 'em out right now. - What about Sarge? - We'll never get a better shot at them. Let's do it, brothers. I'll go high. - Front or back? - Cover your back side. Well, this is as good a place to start as any. Okay, guys, you know what to do. Come on, gas it down. Give me a couple of them. Say, man, the dude that owns this place, how much is he paying us? Five big ones. Yeah? Well, let's burn this fucker good. That's Doc. Out to the van. You okay, man? We're flyin'! Shit. You guys okay? Where the hell were you, big boy? Sorry, I got pinned down by a shotgun. Couldn't have been too bad if someone stopped off for a martini. Come on. But Gertie ID'd 'em. These are the guys that hit Joey. That's right. Same bunch we saw on that dope run. God dammit, we shoulda had 'em. We would have, if Slick didn't have to stop off for the happy hour. That's enough, damn it. Now, I may have some problems, but when it comes to you guys, I don't fuck around. All right, knock it off, the both of you. I don't believe this. You guys ride into town like a bunch of cowboys about to shoot up Main Street and you wonder why it all fell apart. Okay, look, I'm glad we got a fix on who hit Joey, but he died trying to get this neighbourhood back on its feet. Now, if we don't have a plan to finish what he started, we're not helping him at all. Agreed? Yeah. We shouldn't have gone in there. We fucked up. Sorry. Okay, we have got to make a plan and follow it through. - Like Nam? - Just like Nam. Next time these guys make a run, we're gonna be all over 'em. Ray, I want you to make a programme to get that truck. You want a Hogan's Alley? The whole shot? The whole shot. Woody, give me a hand mapping this thing out. Right behind you, Ray. Sarge? Listen. I try not to say anything. You think we can pull this thing off? - Hey... - I mean, with a wino in our squad? - He's coming along. - Really? He was a hell of a soldier in Nam. And from what I see around here, we can use every brother we got. Hmm. Come on, let's go to work. (Bill) To pull this off we need to stop the chase cars. Now, I figure this is perfect for Hogan's Alley. What do you think? (Ray) We could make a good Hogan's Alley out of this. - Any trouble setting up traps, Ray? - No. I foresee no problems whatsoever. Doug. (Tyres screech) (Horns blare) Garrett and I will take the back. You guys take the front. Draw. (Tyres screech) Here. Mommy! Mommy. Ray's down. Woody, cover us. We're coming up. Come on, this is getting tiresome! Oh, thank God. Uncle Sarge. Bastard broke cover to save the kid. Crazy... ...ass hero. (Sirens wail) Come on, guys. Give me that. Let's go. Let's go. - Will you hide these for us, please? - Of course. Go ahead, Boon. I copy. I didn't think Roy Boy was gonna shoot anybody. Yeah, well... They pissed him off. That's the way it goes, right? Yeah. Lieutenant. Boon says he's got bodies shot up all over the alley. They're local gang members. (Hawkins) Time to kick a little ass. And I think I know whose ass to start with. Come on, move it. Come on, let's go. Get in there. - Nice job, Hawkins. - Thanks. (Sighs) I don't know. Maybe I was wrong. Losing Ray that way. Maybe I pushed this thing too far. No. They pushed it too far when they killed Joe. (Garrett) That's right. Gotta see this whole thing through. For both of them. You guys sure? Hey, Neil, how did it go? Everything squared away. You're free to go. I don't think you're gonna have any more problems. They're gonna have a hell of a false arrest suit if anything happens like this again. Hawkins. Do us all a favour. Next time have some evidence before you book somebody. I couldn't get a peep out of anyone on the street. So, what else is new? And Lieutenant, if you are going to make a bad bust, try to make sure they're not represented by the Governor's law firm. Okay, one more time. Crossing gate. Forklift. Guard car. (Garrett) Driver out. Truck out. Hogan's Alley. Barrels. Back here, regroup. You know, Ray set it up real good. Oughta work. Yeah, I'm still worried about not having anybody up high. That would have been Ray. Yeah. (Garrett) Hey, Sarge? You're right. Working it out, going in slow. That's how we used to do it. - We used to do it great. - The best. Yeah, we sure as hell did, didn't we? Is that my chicken? I just talked to the candyman. He wants us to ride shotgun for a load of dopies running through. Man, what is his problem? He's all set up for tomorrow. This load is bigger than usual. Oh, yeah? How big? Five times what we usually get. Really? We're gonna do it a little differently this time. I want you to get us another set of wheels and make sure Doc brings the van. Gotcha. (Bell ringing) Freeze! - You OK? - Yeah. - Who's driving the catering truck? - You got me. How's Bill? Come on, man. We better haul ass to Hogan's Alley. Come on! Back up, back up back up! Shit! That's it. There they go. Who the hell grabbed the catering truck? - Hold-out Harry. - Hold-out Harry? I didn't know we had a hold-out Harry backing us up on this gig. Holy shit. - (Garrett) What is it? - Heroin. (Bill) There's gotta be millions of dollars' worth here. No way this is a normal dope job. That's why they had that other car. There's gonna be a lot of mad punks around here. Mad as bees, and we're sitting on their honey. Okay. Woody, you and I are gonna go back to Auburn Street and check things out. Garrett, stay here and make sure nobody tailed us looking for the truck. Let's go. I just came past Sycamore Street. Something's going on. There's a couple of dozen punks gathered down there. Mr Eckhart here was just explaining it all to us. Seems our heroes here have gotten a hold of some property that belongs to somebody else. Some property? Don't make it sound so dignified. - It's drugs. - Heroin to be exact. Lots of it. These gangs have been protecting big shipments coming through South Point. And for this you want me to fight? No, to protect yourself. There's an easier way out of all this. You just give 'em back what you took. (Louie) And just give up? We'd be worse off than when we started. Come on, folks. This is no kinda life we've been living here, full of terror and fear. There's one thing clear to me now. If we're gonna change things round here, we're gonna have to do it ourselves. (Gunfire) Somebody has got a truck... that's mine. I want it back. What do you make? Hard to tell. The longer you people wait, the hotter it's gonna get. (Sighs) I'm going up on the roof. Get Garrett to get back here as quick as you can, cover the road. Right, Sarge. Louie. Listen, try to keep everybody inside, okay? No matter what, count on us. Thanks. All right. Hey, man, where are you going? I'm gonna go out there and I'm gonna talk to him. - It's never too late to make a deal. - You crazy fool, you can't go out there. We'll see who the fool is. Come on, let's hold it now. Where the hell's my truck? I don't think that any of this is gonna be necessary. - I want my goddamn dope. - I need just a little time. I want my truck. Now! I-I-I'm not sure where it is. But I-I can get it for you. You dumb mother! What am I talking to you for? He almost burned me with that thing. Some mother's on the roof. You stupid mothers! You're gonna pay for this. Bring out the gasoline. - I can't see my father. - He pulled Warren off the street. I'm sure he's all right. What are you doing? They're gonna know we're here. (Screams) - Are you all right? - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm OK. But you ought to see it. They're all fighting. I mean, everybody. (Engine revving) (Whistles) (Roy Boy) See that school bus? Grab that fucker and bring it right here. Now! Move pronto! (Screaming) Shut up! All right, you assholes! I got a busload of your kids. I want my goods. And I'm not gonna tell you again. You bring my truck out here or I'm gonna start throwing out dead kids. He'll do it. Yeah, he will. Yeah. He's gonna be taking care of our future! Garrett, get that truck over here. - Quick. - Coming right up. Hey, you're a real cutie, aren't you? Huh? Yeah. - We're bringing the truck now. - Then get it out here. Why don't you let the kids go first? I ain't bargaining with you, you motherfucker. (Roy Boy) Just get it out here. (Screaming) What the hell's going on down there? (Screaming) (Screaming) Right, anybody comes after her, she gets it. Leave me alone. Not until we're out of here, bitch. Anybody goes shooting at me, you're gonna take the bullet. Hold it right there. Put your gun down or she gets it. Don't do it. (Gun clicks) (Siren wailing) Stupid motherfucker. You're gonna be put away for what you did to Joey Nace. All this for a shitty little cripple? (Roy Boy laughs) Oh, you stupid bastard! (Screaming) (Siren wailing) Get this whole area closed off. Is this hot? Let me have it. Bill's in there. Let's go, Slick. (Siren wailing) I guess you boys haven't been properly introduced. Garrett, Woody, meet Hold-out Harry. - Howdy, fellas? - What the hell? You're the one that took the dope truck? Well, that's not much of a welcome. I thought you guys always wanted to meet Popeye. - Popeye from Nam? - (Bill) You got it. You the son-of-a-bitch used to send us all over hell to do your dirty work! And here we are, doing it again. Well, sometimes even a cop gets fed up when the system falls apart. Yeah, we cleaned out some bad apples for you. Not for me, for those people down there, for this neighbourhood. Yeah, it all works out. I mean, he gave us a lot of protection so we could get the guy that killed Joey. Listen, guys, I'm afraid we got to get out of here, you know. - (Bill) Showtime? - Right. (Siren wailing) Jesus Christ, Captain. That's got to be the biggest load of heroin I've ever seen. Must be worth five, ten million on the street. It's got to be what this street war was all about. Yes. We just made the Police Commissioner a very happy man. Lieutenant, what the hell are you doing? These are the men behind all this. Hawkins, I don't think you understand what's going on here. Just ask some of your witnesses, Captain. I'll tell you. I'll tell you what's going on. These gangs are finally killing one another off, something you police should have been doing all along. The punks have another shootout and you're trying to arrest innocent citizens. You know, Officer, you fellas should be glad that nobody was badly hurt while these punks are down here having their fight. Hawkins, let 'em go. - Let 'em go? - You heard me. - But Captain... - Turn 'em loose. What we got here is one big drug bust. And with this gang war, there's a lot fewer punks down here to cause any more trouble. Don't complicate things with any more of your vigilantes talk. We were able to solve this one without you. Maybe it's time you went back to Metro. Well, it looks like you got what you were after, Captain. Looks like everybody did. Thanks, Bill. Yeah. - Is everyone all right? - Yeah, I think we're OK. - How are you? - Fine. I really don't know what to say. I guess, uh... thank you. You know, this could be a nice, quiet neighbourhood again. I was thinking about sticking around and helping to keep it that way. I think I'd like that. (Clears throat) (All laugh) - Can I buy you a cup of coffee? - Yeah. - Give me a minute, okay? - Okay. Thank you, guys. Thanks for turning me around. Hey, man, war's finally over. The battle maybe. Not the war. Yeah.
