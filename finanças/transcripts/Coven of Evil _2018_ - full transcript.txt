Three years of journalism training and here I am. I'm living at home and writing articles on witchcraft. Hey, it's a publication in the national press. Don't knock it. Yeah, now you're gettin' paid work, maybe you can move out. He's joking. This is your home for as long as you want. She's right. But a little wind'd be nice, though. Mark! Oh, I love it when you're so tough. Gross! Have a great time. Thanks, love. We'll give ya a ring when we get there, but it's a 10-hour flight so you might not be up. He'll still be up. Don't go trashin' the house. Get out of here. Joe Lambert? Yes. My name's Evie. I'm here to talk about your recent article. Can I come in? There ya go. Thank you. Nice place. Do you work from home? Yeah, I'm freelance. So, how did you find me? It wasn't difficult. Okay. So, what can I do for you? Actually, this is more about what I can do for you. Yeah? Yeah. You see, your article was badly written. Look, Joe, have we met before? No. No? No. Then how can you even pretend to know anything about me? I'm the high priestess of the coven you wrote about in your article. Of course you'd have known that if you'd done your research properly. Hang on a minute, I had several reliable witnesses. And yet, you never tried to speak to anyone from the coven. You just went for the cheap headline. No. No? You didn't say that with much conviction. Here's what I think. I think you were so desperate to get published that you were willing to write about anything. No wonder it ended up in a trashy tabloid. That's not fair. Fair? Fair would be getting both sides of the story before concluding that our rituals are nothing more than sexual exploitation. Guys like you perpetuate the bigotry and hatred that's plagued Wiccan women for hundreds of years! I'm sorry if I offended you. Look, Joe, I didn't come here to shout at you. I came here to give you a chance to hear both sides of the story. Okay. Why don't you come into one of our rituals, then you can judge for yourself. I don't know. Oh, come on, Joe. We don't hex our enemies. You'll be quite safe. You can take a boat from the mainland. My husband Zander will pick you up at the village as it's a bit of a trek. We've no phone at the house, so you better arrange a time and place now. How about 2:30 outside the village hall? Hey! Excuse me, excuse me. I'm looking for North Shields Farm. Can you help me? Hello? Can I help ya? Shit, you scared me. I'm the journalist. I was waiting for you at the village hall. You passed me on the road. You nearly run me over. Mustn't have seen ya. Why didn't you go to the village hall? I did, I waited nearly an hour. Musta been early. We said 3:30. We said 2:30. You sure about that? Quite sure. Zander, I hope you're being nice to our guest. We don't want to scare him off. You must excuse my husband, Joe, he's got no manners. That's okay, just a misunderstanding. Don't worry, his bark is worse than his bite. Come on in, I'll introduce you to the rest of the coven. Joe? Everyone, this is Joe. Joe, this is Wes, Raymond, Kissi, and Talia. Hi. Bloody hell, you're handsome, aren't you? Please ignore Kissi, she's quite mad. No, I'm just past giving a shit, darling. There's a difference. Come on, I'll show you to your room. Here, this is you. Bathroom's first on your right. Nice view. Yeah, we're very lucky here. I'll let ya get settled. Come down when you're ready. Dinner's at seven. That was lovely, Evie. Oh, thank you, Joe. Did ya hear that, Zander? He's so polite. So, how many people live here? Just us. What about the other girl? What other girl? I saw another girl in my room when I got here. Don't think so. Wishful thinkin', eh, Joe? I know what I saw. She was lookin' out the window. You've got him seeing ghosts already, Evie. I don't believe in ghosts and I know what I saw. Besides, isn't a coven supposed to be 13? That's bollocks. There's no reason why a coven has to be 13. It means different things to different people. For us it's just about being around people who help us make the most of our gifts. Gifts? All female witches have gifts. Kissi's gift is healing people. Sounds like you'd be a good person to know. And what's your gift? I don't know yet. Talia's gift seems a bit reluctant to reveal itself. Maybe it's seduction. That's my gift. Stop copyin' me. Okay, Talia, because I copy you. I thought your gift was talkin' to the spirit world. That's my other gift. I'm sorry, did you just say you can talk to the spirit world? That's right. Oh really? And what do they say? Lots of things. Right now they're telling me that you need to learn to keep an open mind. Right, I think boys are on washing up duty. Us girls have to make ourselves look presentable for the ritual. How do I look? Lose the tights. Is that thing really necessary? You stick to dressing your little protege. It's cold out. Anyway, a bit of color's a good thing. We don't all want to look like we're at a bloody funeral parade. Zander, don't you ever knock? This is my room, Talia. How do I look? Is this for me or is this for Joe? Both of you. Oh, lighten up, Zander. You haven't been mean to him, have you? I've been on my best behavior, which is more than I can say for you. I blame the full moon. So, are you ready for the big show? Yeah, sure. Sorry, do you mind? No. Thank you, sweetie. Listen, we're a little short on numbers, so I was wondering if you wanted to join in? I thought I was supposed to be watching. I know, but Talia hasn't got a partner. What about Wes or Raymond? Raymond is dancing with Kissi and Wes is drumming. Please, Joe? What do I have to do? Just dance. I can't dance. If you can walk, you can dance. If you can talk, you can sing. Yeah, sure. Look, no one here cares how well you dance. That's right, you're dancing for yourself and for the spirit world. Seriously, Kissi, shut up. Look, I won't make you do anything you don't want to do. I promise. All right, all right, I'll do it. Thanks, Joe. Reckon I'm gonna regret this. Here, I find this helps. Seriously, I've never done it sober. Strong stuff. Something you get used to. No, you finish it. Reckon I drew the short straw. Charming. Hey, man, do you wanna swap? Hey! Hey, you all right? I'm fine.

Just a minute. Jesus, Evie! Breakfast is ready. So, I take it you had fun last night. Fuck you. Oh, so you wanna fuck me now? Well, I think Zander might have something to say about that. You're disgusting. There's nothing disgusting about sex, Joe, it's healthy. What I did to that poor girl was not healthy. You didn't have to do anything if you didn't want to. I wasn't myself. Yes, you were. You fucking drugged me. Oh, that's your story, is it? Oh, you needn't worry. I'm hardly gonna write about the perversion that goes on here now that I've been a part of it. But I'll be leavin' right away. Okay, if that's what you want. It is. Fine. I'll arrange for someone to take you to the station after breakfast. Funnily enough, Evie, I'm not hungry right now. Look, it's either a 20-minute car ride or a two-hour walk. Up to you. Fine. Good. Come downstairs if you change your mind about breakfast. Otherwise, I'll come and get you after we've eaten. I fucking told ya to stay in the house! Evie! So you decided to come down for some breakfast after all. Actually, I've decided to stay, if that's okay. If you're looking for a piece of last night... No. I won't be taking part in anymore rituals. I'll just be watching. It's not just the rituals. Joe, there's something you need to know about this place. All right, Kissi. There are forces here which allow your deepest desires to manifest themselves if you're not strong enough. That's enough! You really believe this stuff, don't you? Ignore her. She's just trying to scare you. Hi, Mum? Where have you been? We've been callin' but we couldn't get through. Yeah, I know, I'm staying with friends in the country. There's no signal at the house. Oh. You know, you had us worried - for a minute. - I'm okay! How was the holiday? Hi. Hi. Talia, about last night. It's okay. You didn't hurt me if that's what you're worried about. Even so, I lost control. We both did. So, what's with all the scarecrows? Evie thinks they keep away evil spirits. And what do you think? I don't know about evil spirits, but they seem to keep most people away. They don't work for me, though. Guess not. I should be going. Right. See ya. Bye. Okay, let's take a look at you. Lift your top up, please. Yes, doctor. Oh, your hands are cold. Sorry. Try and keep still. With one heart we long for thee. Child of earth... Shh! Sorry, so serious. I need to concentrate. Okay, okay. With one heart we long for thee. Child of earth, wind, fire, and sea. Well, am I better? Not yet. Well, I feel better. I'm sure it won't be long. Drink this. No thanks. It made me feel worse last time. All I need is a bit of fresh air. I don't think that's a good idea. Well, if I spend another day cooped up in here, I'm gonna go crazy. You'll get into trouble. Not if you don't tell on me. Hi. Hi. I'm Joe. Alice. Mind if I join you? No, not at all. I'd quite like the company. Oh, I see you found my favorite spot. I could believe that. What a view. I didn't notice you at the ritual last night. I don't, I mean, I'm not part of the coven. Oh, so what do you do here then? I live here. What about you? Oh, Evie invited me. I'm surprised she didn't introduce us. Oh, she probably didn't want you to catch anything. I've been really sick. Oh. I mean, I'm better now. You're not going to catch anything now if that's what you're thinking. I wasn't. Alice! Shit. What have I told you about talkin' to strangers? I thought he was your guest. Go back to the house! We were just talking. You stay the fuck away from her. You got that, mate? Alice. Not a sound. Keep still. I'll teach you to answer back, you little cunt. You feelin' this yet? Yes. What do you say? Sorry. One more time. Sorry. Hi, Joe. Hey. Listen, can I ask you somethin'? Sure. That girl I saw when I got here, it was Alice. Why did you lie about her livin' here? I don't know. Tell me. Because I asked her to. Could you give us a minute? Look, Alice isn't part of the coven. I wanted to keep her out of this in case there was any negative publicity. I'm sure you can understand that given your last article. You shoulda told me. I would've kept her out of it if that's what you woulda wanted. Okay, fair point. Let's be straight with each other from now on. Fine. Good. Now, you're welcome to stay as long as you like, but Alice is off limits, okay? Okay. Good. Now, I'm going to have a nightcap. Do you want to join me? Oh, no, that's okay. I think I'm just gonna head to bed. 'Night, Evie. 'Night. Joe, you never told me what made you change your mind about leaving. What are you doin'? I'm gonna go and check on her. What's that? It's a pillow, Wes. Dickhead, I know what it is. What are you doing with it? I thought I'd make myself comfortable. You can't go to sleep. I know. There's never any action in Alice's room anyway. Which is a shame if you ask me. Zander will kill you if he finds out. Well, you better wake me up if you hear him comin' then, hadn't ya? All right, we'll take it in turns. What? With Alice? Shh, quiet, you'll wake her up. See ya. ♪ All hail Satani ♪ All hail Satani. All hail Satani. Wait. All hail Satani. All hail Satani.

It seems you didn't heed my little warning. I found her sleepwalkin'. I was just gonna bring her back. Is that right? Yeah. Well, that's very kind of ya, but what were you doin' out here at night? Trouble sleeping. I see. Come on, Alice. How did you get out? I don't remember. The guys say it were the window. I don't remember. I'll have it boarded up by tomorrow. Are you gonna apologize? If you're going to hit me, can we get it over with? Is that what you want? Take it off. Take it off or I will. All hail Satani. Keep still. You didn't think it were gonna be that easy, did ya?

You're the high priest of the coven, now act like it. We'll take turn to guard. You're up first. Shh. May the light that shines so very bright help to heal Alice this very night. May the light within her very soul heal her now and make her whole. Get some sleep. It'll be all right in the morning. Thank you. Hey. Joe, I think you should stay away. If the others find out... Jesus, you're really scared of them, aren't you? I'm more worried about what they might do to you. I can take care of myself. Against Zander? What, I can be pretty tough when I wanna be. Oh yeah? Thank you for last night. Don't mention it. No, you were great. Alice, I wanted to ask you something, and I know it's none of my business, but I was gonna ask you anyway. Okay. You're not being held here against your will, are you? No, no, of course not. This is my home. So, what's the deal with Evie and Zander? They don't look old enough to be your parents. That's because they're not. Evie's my sister. So, why do they treat you like a kid? They're just protective, I guess. It's really weird. I've gotta go. Wait. They'll be wondering where I am. Have dinner with me. I can't. Of course you can. Zander would kill you. I told you, I can take care of myself. So, is that a yes? It's a maybe. You seem in a good mood. Do I? Yeah. Must be all that fresh air. So, how are things between you and Joe, Talia? Don't know, I think he's just avoiding me. Probably. He's got what he wanted now. What do you mean? They slept together. Evie! You're so naive. Guys like that are only after one thing. Maybe she's right. I feel so stupid now. Alice, hey. Is it true, you and Talia? Who told you? Nevermind, is it true? Yeah, but it's not what you think. Then what is it Joe? Because from here it looks like you're trying to work your way through us one at a time. No, no, it's not like that. I never meant to... To sleep with her? I know how it sounds, but just hear me out. It was at the ritual the other night. We were dancing, I was high. It didn't mean anything. Oh, so she was just another notch on your belt, was she? I'm sure she'd be delighted to hear that. I've already spoken to her, apologized. Alice, I made a mistake. Yeah, well, so did I. No, it's not... Don't! Don't you dare. Wow, look at you. You're obviously looking to impress someone. I'm not doin' this for a guy if that's what you're thinking. So, what, you wanna be more like me, is that it? Look, Alice, I get it. You're an adult now. It's time we gave you more freedom. But this doesn't suit you, Alice. I want to join the coven. And you will when you're ready. I'm ready. No you're not. Evie, please. I'm ready. Ya think so? Let's see. Glimpse your destiny if you continue down this path. Touch the card and tell me what you see. A knife. The Ace of Swords. Look again. Tell me. No, it's not true. I'd never hurt you. I know because I won't let you join until you're ready. I thought I might find you here. I'm leaving tonight and I just wanted to make sure you'll be okay. I'll be okay. Alice, I'm sorry for what happened. I didn't mean to hurt you or Talia. What happened at the ritual was wrong. What happened at the ritual wasn't your fault. You're a good person. It's this place. It brings out the darkness in all of us. A few days ago I'd have laughed at that, but I've seen things. That's why I didn't wanna leave you, why I stayed. - I wish I could believe that. - It's true. You stayed for me? - Yes. - Why? You always look so sad, like you don't belong here. And when I saw Zander hurt you, I wanted to save you. I should be getting back. So this is goodbye? Yes. No. Well, make up your mind. I can't believe I'm doing this. Listen, the coven have got this meeting tonight which they think I don't know about. I assume you've not been invited. No. The house'll be empty around midnight. How 'bout we have a farewell drink? Sounds good. Shh, she's sleeping. Okay, let's go. Think one of these guys should stay, just in case. No, we need everyone. Wow, you look amazing. Thanks, so do you. Hardly. So, I see you've helped yourself to Zander's best whiskey. That was brave. Well, I figured I'd be gone before he gets back, so what the heck? So, you never told me what you're doing here. Evie doesn't normally invite outsiders. I'm a journalist. I was writing an article about the coven. Evie wanted me to see one of the rituals and that's when, ya know. I see. We must seem strange to you. A little. Just a little? Okay, okay, you're very strange. But I'm glad I came. Master, I call thee forth from the bottomless abyss. Master, I call thee from the ends of the Earth. Master, I call thee from the nighttime sky. Come forth from within my flesh and spirit and greet me as thy humble servant. So, how long have you lived in the coven? Since I was a little girl. Me and Evie grew up here after our parents died. And how long are you planning on staying? I don't know. Anyway, you can't talk, you said you still live at home. You got me there. Although, I do have a little bit more freedom than you. Hey, if you don't like it you can always leave. Evie's the only family I've got left. But that's not a reason to stay. If she doesn't treat you right... She does her best. I mean, it can't have been easy looking after me when she was just a kid herself. She's given up a lot for me. What about Zander? Alice, I've seen the way he treats you. My family were pretty bad, too. I know what it's like to be hurt by people who are supposed to be taking care of you. I'm sorry. Don't be. It was a long time ago. Social Services got me out and I've been with my new family ever since. So, when you said you still live with your parents... I meant them. You're lucky. I know. I sometimes wondered what my life would've been like if they hadn't taken me in. Worse probably. Yeah, probably. Hey, are you okay? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... I'm okay. I'm not doing very well at this, am I? Do you always have this effect on your dates? Not usually, no. Wait, so this, this is a date? Okay, tonight is our last meeting before the ritual. So, if anybody wants to back out, now's your chance. Brothers and sisters, I don't need to tell you how lucky we are. Satanists have waited countless generations for a solar eclipse at the sacred gateway, but we are the chosen ones. Soon we will leave this realm and take our place by our master's side. And in return for our sacrifice, we'll be amongst his trusted generals, immortals, only second to the master himself. Have you finished? Yes. Good. Go and stand with the others, please. Now, we only get one chance at this, so we can't fuck it up. Has anybody got any questions? Yeah, what we gonna do with Joe? Nothing, he leaves tomorrow. Can't just let him walk out of here. He knows too much. He doesn't know shit. He still thinks this is a Wiccan coven. According to him we're all just horny perverts. I'm tellin' ya, he knows. If he suspects anything, it's down to you acting like bloody psychopath and Kissi shoutin' her mouth off about dark spirits. I was tryin' to scare him off. Well, it didn't work, did it? Now, has anybody else said anything to Joe? Talia? I might have said somethin' about the scarecrows. What about them? Just that we use them to scare away evil spirits. So what? So he thinks we're superstitious. Has anyone else said anything? Hmm? Good. I still say that we kill him. And risk someone finding the body before the ritual? Not if we do it right. I'm with Zander. Me, too. Well, that's settled then. Unless you've got a better idea. Actually, I do. Do you have to leave tomorrow? I think I've overstayed my welcome with the others. Will we see each other again? I guess it's up to you. Then I'm sure we will. But just in case. What are you doing? Giving you something to remember me by. You've not done this before, have you? Is it that obvious? No, it's just, are you sure? I wouldn't be here if I wasn't. Slow down. What's wrong? Sorry, I can't. Why not? Save yourself for someone special. Goodnight, Alice. Goodbye, Joe. Okay, let's have a little rehearsal, shall we? Our lovely Talia has agreed to play the part of Alice. You know, you get one of those lovely little legs, sweetheart. Oh, pathetic. Shut up. She's only jealous. Come on, stop fuckin' around, let's do this. Bring forward the sacrifice. Ow, fuck. No need for that. Kissi will give her something so she won't struggle. Just guide her. That's making me dizzy. Sorry. Evie, to make it quick, pull the head forward and sever the arteries. That way she'll bleed out rather than suffocate. No, she's supposed to suffer, that's the point. Knife? Don't look at me. I told you to bring it. Jesus, guys. Hurry up, this is hurtin' my neck. Oh, a bunch of fuckin' amateurs. Just find me anything, Wes. A stick or something will do. Use this. Jesus, not too close with that. Relax, okay? Shoulders straight. Now, we have to time this carefully. The gateway will only be open for a few seconds at the peak of the eclipse. Maybe I should do it. It's the high priestess's job. You announce the offering. Evie, you've not killed before. She's your sister. You don't know what... Well now I know. Good knife by the way. I think I'll use this one if you don't mind. It's about time we all showed a little faith here. Look at this bountiful meal that our master has provided for us.

Joe? It's okay, you were sleepwalking again. - I'm taking you back to the house. - No, put me down, please. I don't wanna go back there. What? You were right. I'm not happy there, not really. Okay, don't need to look so smug about it. I'm not, I'm just, I'm glad you realized. Okay, smartass. You were right about another thing, too. Oh, what's that? About saving myself for someone special. You deserve to be happy. It's like all these years I've been waiting for the right person, and now I finally found him. Really? Yes. Well, I guess you'll have to introduce me so I can tell him how lucky he is. We should go. Okay, we'll go back to the house and then we can... No, we can't go back there. They won't just let me leave. All right, I'll go and I'll get some... No, Joe, please. You don't know them like I do. It's too dangerous. All right, let's go. This way. Zander, you better come quick! Alice? Fuckin' hell. Traitor. - Zander, look at the windows! - I warned you! They escaped anyways. Zander, please. She didn't come past us. The windows are still boarded up. This place is helping her. Zander! Zander, for fuck's sake! Zander, think. Think. We all need to look for Alice. Come on, hurry up. Maybe someone should stay by the car in case they're on the road. No, they won't go that far. We'll cut 'em off. You two, that way. Evie, Wes, top. I'll go middle, move. What was that? This is bollocks. If they have run away, they'll be halfway to the village by now. I hope not, Raymond, for your sake. Evie were right. Shoulda stayed in the car. - Hey! - Run! They're all in the woods. Caught ya. Joe. Alice, where are we? Back at the house. Joe, I'm so sorry I got you into this. Hey, it's not your fault. They're the bastards. We need to get out of here. I'll try and untie you. It's no use, I've tried. Let's tip the chairs. Maybe it'll loosen the ropes. What if they hear us? We need to try somethin'! On three, yeah? Okay. One, two... Wait, what was that? What? I heard something. They're coming, okay. Let me do the talking. I hope you're not too uncomfortable to sleep. Listen, Evie, I'm sorry, okay? I've learned my lesson, I won't try and escape again. Please, just let us go. I'm afraid it's too late for that. Then can I ask that you don't take this out on Joe? It's not his fault. If anyone needs to be punished, it's me. Alice, no! Alice, this has never been about punishing you. Well, for some of us anyway. This has all been about preparing you. Preparing me for what? For today. You know what's special about today, right? The eclipse. That's right. And you get to be part of one of our rituals. That's what you've always wanted, isn't it? That's why you've been keeping me pure? A sacrifice? You know I hate to talk about destiny. It always sounds so cliche, but deep down I think you've always known. Evie, you can't do this. She's your sister. Yes, and I love her. That's why she'll make a worthy sacrifice. Evie, please. Oh, shut him up. No, don't hurt him. He has nothing to do with this. Let him go and you can do what you want with me. I won't fight. You're really quite taken with him, aren't you? Evie, it won't work. She's not pure. So you fucked her, is that what you're tryin' to tell me? I saw something in the woods. It's true what Kissi said, isn't it? About there being forces here that can manifest your deepest desires. Alice manifested that thing, meaning she's not that pure after all. Very good, Joe. He's right, ya know. You're not pure enough. I tried to protect your innocence, but the darkness of this place and Zander's punishments, it was all too much. We looked for another sacrifice, but I knew no one would be worthy enough to fill your shoes. That's when I had the idea of using your child. I don't have a child. You will, thanks to Joe here. Do you still think it was Talia under that mask? ♪ All hail Satani ♪ Rohypnol, but I guess you were too high to notice. ♪ All hail Satani ♪ Alice, I'm sorry. I didn't know. Of course I couldn't let one of the coven do it. No, much better to be an outsider, someone untainted by the darkness of this place. That was only a few days ago. How can you be sure she's pregnant? Well, the ritual should've increased fertility, but I couldn't be sure. That's why I needed a second opinion. Kissi. Okay, let's take a look at you. Lift your top up, please. Yes, doctor. With one heart we long for thee. Child of earth, wind, fire, and sea. Ideally we'd wait until the child was a bit older, but unfortunately we're out of time. Talking of which, we need to get you kids ready. No, leave him alone. Oh, don't worry. No harm will come to Daddy. Quite the opposite. He gets to watch while I kill his child and its mother. I'll fuckin' kill you, - altar boy. - Enough, enough! Enough, get him out of here. - No, Evie, please. - Wes, get in here. - Zander. - Fuckin' twat. Hold him down. Get this piece of shit out of here. - No, Zander, please. - Get him up. - Alice! - Evie, please. Shh, shh, it's nearly sunrise. It's time to make you look pretty. - Kissi! - Evie, please, don't do this. Oh, shh, shh, it's okay. It's okay, it'll all be over soon and you get to be with Mum and Dad. I'm gonna miss you, Alice, but you need to see what we're trying to do here. We're going to be immortal, me and Zander. Not just that, but we'll be like gods. I mean, surely you can see how exciting that is. No, no, no, no, no. Shh, this is the best way. Come on, Alice, you don't wanna suffer. You always were determined, Alice. But then again, so am I. Eh? Sorry, lad, I didn't catch that. Hold still. Shit, lads, I think it's alive. Ah, I'll save ya. That was a soft one. Come on, stop fuckin' about. If you're gonna hit him, hit him right. Shit, that looks like it hurts. Steady on, guys, you nearly pulled that thing out of the ground. Here she comes to spoil the fun. I heard that. You were meant to. Good job, guys, he looks great. Is he how you imagined him? Better. Bit of a nut here, Evie. Ah, you sound surprised. On second thoughts, go to the mask. I want him to be able to see everything properly. Time to say goodbye to your sweetheart. No! Guys, would you go and fetch Alice, please? Oh, and Raymond, no funny business. She belongs to the master now. No, no! Whoa, she looks incredible. A worthy sacrifice. Definitely. I wish I was the master. Careful, Wes. She looks a bit spaced out. What have you given her? Just something to make her cooperate. Yeah? I thought Evie wanted her to suffer. Oh, it's not Evie that wants to make her suffer. It's the will of the master. Whatever. So, she can still feel things, - right? - Yes. Can she feel this? Raymond. Ya know, you got me and Wes into a lotta trouble. But it's okay, I forgive you. Raymond! I've always wanted to do that. All right, you've had your little thrill. Now, help her up. It's showtime. ♪ Satanas Domine ♪ Alice. Alice, come forward. Kneel down. ♪ Domine ♪ Tilt your head back. Oh Lord, we offer you a gift. - No! - Worthy of this - great occasion. - No, no! You've been weak. All your life you've allowed yourself to be abused, waiting for a hero to come and save you. This has to change, Alice. You're responsible for another life now. All that we ask is that you allow us to serve beside you. No! Stay back. Back off, all of you. You bitch, I shoulda tied you up. Shut up. Cut him down. - No. - You wouldn't do it. I don't believe you'll do it. Oh yeah? Remember what was on that card? Cut him down. Do it. Hurry up. Give him the knife. You better not try and follow us. I'll kill ya, I'll kill ya both. Kissi, quick, you've got to help. You've got to heal her. No. Don't, Zander, no! It's no use, the wound's too deep! You've got to do something! There's only one way that you can help her now. Wes, finish the sacrifice. No! Quickly, we need to cross over before Evie dies. She is not a worthy sacrifice. She is not a worthy sacrifice, and neither is the other man you killed. Evie! You know the penalty for offering up one who is not worthy. Master. No, merely the gatekeeper. One of many. Take me with you. Come, you will never be harmed by anyone again. Alice! Alice, no! Alice! Alice! No. Alice. I thought I lost you. They gave me a choice. I thought our baby should know its father. So, I hope you plan on sticking around. I'm planning on gettin' as far away from here as possible. And I'm planning on taking you with me. I mean, if you want. Well, there's nothing left for me here. Good, that's settled then. What are you doing? Taking you with me. Are you planning on carrying me back all the way to the village? Yup. I don't think you're strong enough. Maybe you're right. You're the strong one. It's your turn. I've got work tomorrow. It's Saturday. Okay. Maddie, Maddie.
