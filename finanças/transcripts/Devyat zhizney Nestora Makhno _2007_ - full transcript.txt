[EPISODE TWELVE] [EPISODE TWELVE] How you living, Danila? I am ok. I would be better if they wouldn't be shooting. [GULYAIPOLYE, 1921] I am ok. I would be better if they wouldn't be shooting. [GULYAIPOLYE, 1921] Send a telegram to Kharkiv, to Frunze. Send a telegram to Kharkiv, to Frunze. "I have occupied Gulyaipolye, our anarchist capitol. But we haven't. -I will, keep writing. "I kindly ask not to be disturbed here." -They will be angry about this. No matter - the more anger, the more confusion. Batka, they captured thirty reds over there. What should we do with them? See if any of them want to fight for us. Shoot the rest. Sounds good. Batka. Listen. [Indistinct] has not reached us. They quarrelled to no end, like dogs. You hear me, batka? Batka! We captured three whole wagons of bread too. You hear me? Three wagons! I am trying to listen to the skylark. What a beautiful creature. Stop or we will shoot! I am about to... surrender all your weapons at once! My god... My god, Nestor! Nestor, people were saying you were killed in Crimea. Nonsense. I always come home. Stay with me. My son... my wayward son! Oh my god...by god, why is your leg limp? Was it shot? No... just twisted my ankle. -Don't lie to your mother! I have nothing to serve. Nothing to feed you! They took everything from us, from everyone. Especially from us - they call us Makhno bitches. You will get five bags of grain from the station at once. Go and see to it. Where is your wife? Still out there fighting. -Fighting a war? Is that what women do nowadays? This could be the last time I see you... What can I say to you, mum? You will live for a long while to come. Maybe I will, Nestor... The reds are quite powerful - you should make peace with them. Like a cat making peace with a mouse? No. [Novonikolayevka village] [Novonikolayevka village] Nestor, you up? No decent wedding... No love, like regular people have. One day we will die... And that's it. Are you looking for some type of heavenly life? I want tenderness. Conversations about love. Quiet ones, whispers... Kisses and stuff like that... All kinds of kisses... For you to take care of yours. -I have plenty of love, Galina... As for a different kind of life, with peacocks grazing in the yard. I am sorry. That kind of life may never happen. Nestor, come on, get up, red cavalry. Some kind of Kotovskiy brigade, may his anus be penetrated by a head of lettuce! Hurry up, get up, get dressed! Yurko, get the tachanka ready! Kozha! This here horse is real strong. Get the belt ready! Where is the belt? We used the last of it in Gulyaipolye. We got any loose rounds? -No. What is in the bag then? -Just coin. You fool! Ammunition is far more precious than money! Stepan, slow down a bit, would you? Those look like our guys. -If they are on that side, they are traitors. Courtesy of batko Makhno's purse! Get you some! Take it, you scum! Take this... -Hold on! It's working. So what? How much have you gifted to the Kotovskiy corps? Nearly everything. About six thousand left. What a woman! Even a machine-gun would not have been so effective! Nestor! You better never call me a fool again. Remember, I too am capable of feeling dignity. Oh, oh. I didn't say anything about expending the war chest, have I? You ready, boys? Let's go! What's up, Galina? Have you saved some coin for the reds? How did you say it before? We, too, are capable of feeling dignity. Let's go forth, Stepan. Slowly, slowly, let's go. Commander of first cavalry brigade Maslyakov. Commander of the army batka Makhno. I heard of you, Maslyak. They say you make a fine butcher. -Much obliged. We heard of you too, batko Makhno. Please take this brigade under your charge. Are you drunk? Here is the thing... The brigade voted to go with batko Makhno. They are tired of the new czars. We shoot them, they shoot us... How long can this continue? It's killing us peasants. It's no good. In the place of Mr. Frunze, the punishment mission is now commanded by Robert Eidmann. A demon. A rough man. Shot countless people. Most of all, my boys did not appreciate this paper right here. Trotsky's order. Here, listen! This concerns all of us. "Any territory where Makhno's gang is active... "'Makhno's gang...' a regime of socialist occupation must be instated. "Confiscate all horses and produce. "Any houses giving shelter to the bandits must be destroyed. "Everywhere you go, create from the poor peasants "extermination squads and reward them with "produce confiscated from Makhno's units." All of a sudden he respects us, this Trotsky. He amassed more forces against you than against Wrangel. Cavalry, armoured trains... Airplanes... -We know, we know... I hear this, Maslyakov. I think... Why do you seek death alongside us? They will finish me off before long. You could live well, basking in the glory... I am tired of their lies. They say one thing and do another. But they clearly do evil. Another thing. Do not go under my charge. They are too many, I can't handle it anyway... They will strangle me like a wolf. Don't lead your people to our lands, lead them to foreign lands. To Abyssinia or elsewhere... Maybe things will play out differently there. Are you serious? Yes, I am serious. God only knows what's going on out there... The peasants there have been putting in real work. My brigade headed there. Just one request: Wherever you go, say that batka Makhno is with you. Throw sand in their eyes, so to speak. That's a fine idea. Too bad, batka... that our paths are diverging. Dubadiy! Stop. Well, now. I always heeded your advice, Pyotr Andreyvich. Now you listen to mine. My final advice. Leave us. You are a man of intelligence. Unarmed... no one will touch you. Go on back. What about you? We will stay here and expire. You, Victor Antonovich, might find more safety down south... No, batya. I will head to Turkey. They are fighting for freedom there too... Ataturk against the sultan... I will go chop up some Turks. -Alright. If any of the boys want to join you, take them with you. Look! There it is! Czar's airplane! Czar's airplane! He's circling, that bastard... Get out before dark. Otherwise it will be too late. We will head to Lyovpol. If we make it, we will live. Let's go! Go. [TSIBULNIK VILLAGE] Sleep, boys, sleep. Makhno! Batko! What is it? -Listen. The peasants over there attacked our boys with pitchforks. I brought back Schus. Where is he? Boys! Take him. Get him, get him, get him. Stay down. Stay calm. Calm down. Gauze. No need. There's no much blood, see? It's all going inside. This is it... Batka. Give me some boys, huh? We have ammunition, one belt will be enough, pop-pop-pop all of them, just give me some boys! No, Foma. What are you on about? I don't fight against peasants. This is it, our war is over. Peasants are killing Makhnovists now... it's all over. Time to head for the borders. What about our goal? What are we living for then? You... You are asking me this, woman? One must outlive, always! Such is the law! Had I not known it, I would already have died in childhood. Nestor... Nestor... I want to make a final confession. It was me who shot Nastya... I shot Nastya and your son... Forgive me. Forgive me. That was a long time ago. I don't remember. Forgive me! I am not god. I am not god, Fyedos. If there is someone up there, let him forgive you. Forgive me. Forgive... ...my friend. -Little Vadim and Nastya will forgive you. You will find them where you are headed. What kind of warrior were you, Fyedos, to kill a child? He was a real anarchist. There won't be any more like him... How many times are they going to shoot batko? Cadets over there. Red cadets, headed this way. Listen, Lyova. All of you go and run and I will hold them off here. With just one hand? I will stay with you. As your assistant gunner and your friend. What's up, boys? Looks like this is goodbye. I am glad to have been fighting alongside you all for a bit. See you in Odessa. At cafe Marconi. Listen, Zadov! Watch your ass! Got it, got it. -That's right! You as well! What's up, my son? We will stay and chop up some boys then. Well? Sure will. [DNIESTR RIVER, 1921. ROMANIAN BORDER] That's border patrol, batya. I will clear those boys out in an instant. We must... sneak past the border. Must be quiet. Alright then, we will make it quiet... let's go! [ROMANIA, 1921. HOSPITAL] [ROMANIA, 1921. HOSPITAL] Alright. Come on, try to open your mouth. Be careful. Oh... Incredible that he survived. Wow... Alright. As you know, the Soviet will demand your surrender as a war criminal. Poland and Germany want this especially. I don't even know. We will try something... Maybe we will hospitalise you for three months... Then we will see, eh? Romania is a humane country. European. I will try, I will try to see to it that you, courtesy of our government, receive oral surgery. Prosthetic teeth, but... It will not be easy. You have money, right? Here. The newspapers are saying that you exported innumerable treasure. After all, you are this bandit, right? I hope that, once your treasure is within your reach, you will not forget me. We..... -What? We will see... Alright, ok, ok... Rest up. [ROMANIA, 1922. HOSPITAL] It's beautiful here. So calm... [singing Виднеются в Тумане Огоньки - Одесские Каникулы] ♪ Odessa, I won't get to drink your wine... ♪ or sweep your walkways with my pants' hems... So batya, I will probably return. Back there. We rceived amnesty in the SSR and in Ukraine. Do you believe it? I could believe it or not, but... I don't really want to starve to death. -Right, right. What is here for me to do? Who am I here? Maybe I can work something out... Oh! I've taken some sin upon my soul. Requisitioned from one of the countesses of Yekaterinoslav. I hope it will be useful for you on a rainy day. There is nothing else. Keep it for yourself. Alright then... Ok batka. Don't vanish. [PARIS, 1930] Here, monsieur Anbar. This is my husband. Husband? Where does he intend to live? I have a large room. Your room? That room is my laundry manager's office. As long as you, madam, are the manager, it is your room. What does your husband have to do with that? Mum! Lucy, do you remember how we used to live in Poland? This is your father, he came back. You understand, I... I can't argue with him. It's practically impossible to find work here. Especially now... There is an apartment for rent where one of my friends live. It's far, of course, but... You can come visit Lucy from time to time, go visit the zoo... Isn't that right, Lucy? -Yes. Ok, now go to your room. You will see each other again. Lieutenant colonel, where are your manners? Trying to roll a fat one? Something interesting? "After ten years of bouncing between various Eastern "European prisons, once-famous anarchist terrorist Nestor Makhno "arrived in Paris to reunite with his family. "Several Russian ex-anarchists personally "came to greet him at the train station, "along with the chairman of the Paris Anarchist Society." Are you left unemployed? Something just came up. Dad. Good evening, father. Father, he drew filth in my notebook. Such filth is in every publication nowadays. We will send him to the cadets, and he will quickly learn. I don't want to! I'm not a militarist! Not a militarist? Put on some epaulettes and you will become one! Yes, lieutenant colonel, sir! -About face! Forward, march! Go do your assignments. A taxi for the occasion of your arrival. Everything is very expensive here. Even the metro is scary expensive. Do you live with him? With whom? With that... moustache guy? What do you mean?... He is my landlord. It's all very strict. He is in power. Stop right there. Are we really already there? No, let's walk and save a little money. You will have a hard time finding work, if you can even find any at all. Why so? I have excellent skills in carpentry and shoe making. Also I have this card... identification, a Russian passport... The French themselves cannot find work. Larisa! Are you home? Open up! Last night... I think I drove your Makhno. With his wife, perhaps. Where did you let them off? In the Bobino district. They proceeded on foot from there. Did you see where he lives? It was very dark. What is he to you? You need him real bad? No, just curious. You go to school? I do. It's very close to home. You know, there are many Russian boys and girls studying there. Are you friends with them? I am friends with some and I fight with others. You fight? When you get hit, you must hit back, right? -That's right, daughter. That's the truth. Always hit back. Dad, why don't you live with us? I am very sick, Lucy, I could get you all sick too. Go get some water, Lucy. Daddy, daddy, come look! I am coming, Lucy, I am coming! Get out of here! Go away! Try something and I will bite your face off, scum. Bonjour madam. -Bonjour, miss. Ice cream? I would love some ice cream. The finest ice cream for the sweetest little girl! Here you go, my dear. Mummy! Mummy, a leopard growled at me and daddy chased it away. The leopard got scared and left. My hands are freezing. Our father is very fierce. Even leopards fear him. Let's go? We are leaving. Tomorrow evening, a doctor will come and visit you. Be home. Galya, let's not spend money on these doctors. You absolutely need a doctor. Do you want a ride? -I will go on foot. Bye, dad! -Bye. You look familiar. Kusch. -Roman Savelyich. Here is one person I certainly did not expect to see. That's a mistake. They may spit. It smells quite bad here, though. True. Old wounds reopened. Excuse me, I mean fistulas. They also say my tuberculosis reached a terminal stage. [Play on words combining "death" and adieu"] They advised me to go to the Azure coast, to Nice. Stop it, Nestor. The whole reason Roman Savelyevich came is to figure out what you need. He is the advisor to our consulate. Ours? Whose is that? Yes. Yes. Of the soviet country. I am not yours though, am I? What must I do to be yours again? Denikin is around here somewhere. Should I kill him? Or Trotsky? Yes, Nestor... We used to be close friends once upon a time. You may return home, you know. Pension, sanatorium, Crimea... What have I done to earn so much? Or is it simply benevolence? Even if so. All you have to do is write a couple of words - truthful words! "I repent. I accept the triumph of soviet power." That's it. Afterwards, you could even stay here. We will provide a pension. A modest one, to tell the truth, but sufficient to live a life of dignity. "Triumph," you say. I read you have completely doomed the peasantry. Turned them into some proletarians. Hold on, Nestor! It turned out to be far more complicated with the peasantry than we had thought. So what happened? The peasantry demanded total liberty. Isn't that so? Without responsibilities. We had to appoint them to their proper place. There will not be any bread. -There will be! There will be, Nestor! Look at what happened in Ukraine since all the hunger, eh? Dniepr area. Our own Zaporizh threshold, yes? Underwater! So... take a Kievan transport centre or train station... You must assume a wider perspective, Nestor! All the tractors idling on the steppe! Wait, Pyotr Andreyvich. Are you preparing to return to Russia? Yes. I submitted an application and it was accepted. Roman Savelyich here helped. They promise me an instructor's position in Dnepropetrovsk. There are three institutes there now. Nestor, that's in our own former Yekaterinoslav! There will be more! Alright then, I am very happy for you. What? Is Parisian poverty so much better? No, Nestor. We must honestly... honestly admit our errors. The Bolsheviks did not win by accident. Yes, not by accident. Alright, Nestor. You think on it. Think. You know the address. Goodbye, Nestor. -Goodbye. The past... is the past. Say hello to Butyrka prison for me. Mandolin! Tell me this: could you, an advisor, a person of the general rank, play the mandolin just like you used to? Your mother is still alive, by the way. She is very old though, truth be told... Kusch, is that you? Pan Danilevskiy. You came to kill me? There is no one here to kill. I am not here. I would be glad for you to kill me. You are too late.
