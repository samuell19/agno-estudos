Honestly, I introduce myself to people as a petty actor. There are 60 staff members and actors. The production sets the feast. All I have to do is enjoy it. HWANG JUNG-MIN, BLUE DRAGON AWARDS CHOSEN ACTOR Hwang Jung-min has proven his star power again. Over 50 million viewers have watched films starring Hwang. It's a record for a lead actor in Korea. I portrayed a bad gangster… A severely mutilated corpse was found in Paldang Dam yesterday. A DNA test found the body is that of the missing Namyangju café owner. Police are investigating CCTV footage near the scene. However, as it is in a remote place, they are struggling to find leads. Here comes the star of In Cold Blood! Hwang Jung-min! PRESS CONFERENCE The award-winning box office sensation! Smile, please! What a smile! Mr. Hwang? Could you stand to the right? - Over here, please! - Now to the left? Will he win another Best Actor Award? How about a big thumbs up? Thank you! - Hold this for me? - Yes, sir. I feel sick from drinking on an empty stomach. Tell the director and the others that I had to go. Got my medicine? Of course. Sure you're okay? I'm fine. How many times must I say it? You drank a lot tonight. I'll drive you home, sir. With your wife away, going somewhere nice? Where would I go? I like being free in my home! Freedom! Go have another round with the others and have fun. - Yes, sir. - Don't forget to call me in the morning. Of course, sir. Take care. - Good work. - Thank you! The interview is at one o'clock. - Thank you. - Thank you. Take care. Isn't he that actor? Hello, sir. Aren't you used to seeing me by now? By the way, my friend is so grateful for your autograph. - Really? - Yes. Then $30, please. I don't believe this… What is it? Did Tottenham lose again? It's about a missing person. You know the café owner who was mutilated? It's all over the news. A part-time worker there went missing with him. But that's not in the news. But the police must know. Her sister thinks they're not investigating properly and posted it. I don't get it. With CCTVs everywhere, they'll find her soon. Can I leave my car here like last time? Yes, as usual. I'll take it in the morning. Thanks. Sure. Good night! Holy cow! For real? You're Hwang Jung-min, right? Star of Ode to My Father and Veteran? "We don't have integrity, but don't we have money!" Right? Mister? What are you doing on someone else's car? But this is my car. This is my car, right? Stand straight. Is it your car, huh? How about a handshake, Mr. Hwang Jung-min? You're so strong. Good night, then. Wait! How about a picture? I'm sorry. I drank too much. I drank too. I'm sorry. No pictures. Mr. Hwang? I'm dying to know. What stars did you do it with? - What? - Celebrities. Who did you fuck? Damn shitheads! Cut the crap. Shitheads? How dare you? Fuckin' asshole! Can you fight, huh? You're a fighter, huh? Shit… Damn bastards. Where the heck is my key? Not again. What the hell! Get lost! Somebody… Please, help me. Fuck! It's not working! Holy shit! Holy! Shit! A celebrity? Hey! Bitch! You know that man, right? Yes. Stop it! Stop filming! Is this Candid Camera? You're YouTubers, aren't you? Drop the act and let me go before I call the cops! Untie me now, bastards! Who says you get your way? Bastard! Being a celebrity doesn't make you God! How dare you look down on us! Think you can boss us around? Wait! Hold on! Not the face. I have an interview later. You crack me up. Still don't get the picture? This is real, birdbrain! Mr. Hwang? Think it's unfair? - Who the hell are you bastards? - Shut the fuck up! You can't do this to me. What did I do wrong? If you were me, would you just pass up a rich mega-star? Think about it. Is it for money? You'll be sending me money by 10:00 p.m. tonight. We'll agree on the amount. When it comes in, you can go home. If it doesn't… you'll end up like this. Mister? Time is up, but only $80,000 came in. Business has been slow. It's all I could get. I'll give you the rest soon. I'm so sorry. Asshole! But your car is worth $100,000! I'm so sorry. No! Wait! I'll pay you! Please don't! Can I go now? Thank you, sir! - Thank you! - Sir! What about me? Please don't go. Please, sir. What? You're sorry? Why? Then pray for her. Pray? Yes, sir. I'll pray. I'll pray, sir. Dear God. Thank you for rescuing me. Please send So-yeon home as well. Amen. Amen! I'll fix it. Is it funny? No! No! No, sir! Look! He's going! Please don't do this. I don't have any money! Please! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Stop! For God's sake, don't do it! Stop it! Don't do it! I'll pay! I'll pay you! I'll give you the money! Stop and let us go! I'll pay you! How much did I say to give me? Say it. $200,000… $200,000. Then for the two of you… How much? I'll give you $500,000. $500,000? How many films did you star in, Hwang? You get paid more than that in one film! Don't fuck with me! You said to pay by tomorrow. The withdrawal limit per day is $500,000. Of course I can give you more. But as time goes by, people will know that I'm missing. You don't want that, do you? $500,000. It's the most I can give you now. But when you get it, promise you'll let us go. Stop right there! Gotcha! Come here! Relax! ABDUCTORS' ACCOMPLICE CAUGHT - Hold still! - Let go! Yeom Dong-hoon? How does he know Bang? They were cellmates. Bang got Yeom Dong-hoon the truck to abduct the café owner. The truck's gone. They must've changed the plates. What about the girl who also got abducted? We're trying to locate her, but it's hard, sir. I'll start by grilling Bang first. Watch the embargo policy. Word on the abducted girl can't get out. Yes, sir. Hey, Bang! Who are your accomplices besides Yeom Dong-hoon? I'm not an accomplice! All I did was sell a truck to Yeom Dong-hoon, that jerk! Yeom abducted a man and was supposed to get $200,000. But, when he only got $80,000, he sent 17 pieces of the man home. Said it's worth $80,000. You just admitted to selling Yeom the truck. Tell me everything you remember before I throw you in as an accomplice. Let me try. "All you gotta do is trust your damn bro. Right?" I'm a fan. I saw all your movies. Say the line, "Come at me!" from your movie. I don't want to. Just once? "Come at me." Like in the movie! "Come at me! Come at me, asshole!" Happy? Hey, Hwang! Where's your card? - What card? - The OTP card! I need it to wire the money. I think it's at home. Fuck! Then how can we get the money? Go get it at my house. No one is home anyway. What the fuck are you saying? Boss? This bastard's playing with us. Why would I do that at a time like this? What's your secret code. Let's check his bank balance to see if he's lying. Wanna expose our location? All the others begged for their lives. Aren't you scared? Why don't you believe me? I promised you. All I want is to get out of here. So go to my house and take the card. Get the PIN number and everything. I'll go with Young-lok. Set up the rest in the warehouse. If I'm not back by 10:00 p.m., kill 'em both. Mister? TIME REMAINING UNTIL 10:00 P.M. Mister! Thank you for earlier. Your sister posted on the Internet. About you being missing. The police are looking for you. Really? But will they find us by tonight? Mister? Once they get your money, we can go home, right? They showed us their faces. It's one or the other. They're sure they won't be caught. Or they planned to kill us from the start. Mister? - Aren't you going? - Bye. You've got it wrong. Yeom Dong-hoon is incapable of doing that. Choi Ki-wan. Yeom Dong-hoon and Ko Young-lok are Choi's underlings. Choi Ki-wan is nasty. I worked here for 25 years. You can't let him go. 3 MONTHS EARLIER CHUNG-SONG PRISON Didn't you hear the bell? Come out. Maybe he's still doing something bad right now. We must locate Choi Ki-wan first. He's the one in charge. Based on what? Bang said Yeom is working for someone. It's Choi Ki-wan, sir. When Choi worked at a mine, he stole explosives and abducted the manager. I'll check out his address first. Damn… Miss? Listen! Kick that piece of glass over here. Try to kick the piece of glass over here. For what? Don't do anything. It's okay. Just kick the glass piece over. Don't worry. You don't know them! They're totally scary. Just kick it over here. Don't you want to get out? Good. Over here. Kick it to my feet. That's it! Shit. I'm sorry. Please be quiet! What! Having a good time, huh? I'm telling the boss. Why you! Go ahead. Mister! Get up! Hurry! I gotcha, bastard. Hey! Star actor? Stop staring. Never seen a C-cup? You get on my nerves. Don't act like an angel. HWANG'S AGENCY The person you are calling is unavailable… What the hell are you saying? Think you can do the interview? That's not what I meant. If my manger can't reach me, he'll call the police. I should call him to say I can't go to the interview. If you say anything, you're dead. The pill must be strong. He drank a lot last night. Of course he can't get up. The doctor said he must take the pill regularly, sir. UNKNOWN CALLER Wait a minute, sir. What? The person you are calling is unavailable… He must be too busy to take calls from an unknown number. Fuck! Then what? Hello? Sung-woong? It's me, Jung-min. Hi, brother! What's with this number? I'm borrowing someone else's phone. About our interview later, I can't make it. What? Why can't you come? Something came up at home. Do me a favor? Can you call my agent for me? I can't reach him. What's wrong? You're not one to miss an interview. Are you abducted or something? Abducted? Are you out of your mind? Just kidding. Tell me what's going on. - What's wrong? - Hang up now! Tell my agent, okay? And to the reporters, Seo Do-chul and Choi Chul-ki. Who? Tell Seo Do-chul and Choi Chul-ki I'm really sorry. Seo Do-chul and Choi Chul-ki! Who's that? Park Sung-woong, the actor? "I'll let you live." No! The reporters! Why mention them? An interview got canceled because of me last time too. I owe them an apology. CHOI KI-WAN'S HOUSE Anyone home? It's the police. We're from Seoul Metro Police. Ma'am? The door is opened. "Stylish Hwang Jung-min, the star actor, is here." Nope. He's here. Right here. - Where are the others? - The warehouse. Is it far from here? Five minutes away by walking or half that if you run. Listen. I have to take my medicine. It's for my heart. If I miss taking it once, I'll have complications. Could you buy me a calming… Cheongsimhwan for the heart? I can't. Boss said I can't go anywhere because of my face. Never. Are you okay? I set up everything in the warehouse and am on my way back. At least untie my hands? I can't breathe! Hell no! I can't! Hey, loser. Take it. Hello? Hey, Hwang. I looked everywhere you said, but it's not here. Look carefully. It's there! Trying to buy time hoping the police will save you? Tell me on the count of three. One. Two. Your family is returning from a trip, huh? It's at the store! It's with my keys! I left it at the store! If it's not there either, I'll ask your family at 8:00 p.m. Is he taking a shower? - Hello, Mr. Park. - Hi. Jung-min called earlier and said he couldn't come. What's going on? But I'm outside his house now. Why did he tell you that instead of me? What did you do wrong this time? And who are Choi Chul-ki and Seo Do-chul? Who? He said to tell the reporters that he's sorry. But I didn't see them on the press list today. Of course they're not. Choi Chul-ki and Seo Do-chul aren't reporters. They're detectives in The Unjust and Veteran. They were his names in those movies. Wait a minute. If he said to deliver a message to Choi Chul-ki and Seo Do-chul, does it mean to report to the police? Report what to the police? Are you still drunk? Right. I'll call you later, sir. Sir! It's Kyung-hyun! 911? We're fucked! Wake up, mister! Bad heart! He says missing one pill could kill him! What the fuck? Buy him a cheongsimhwan. He said that would help. Shut up, bitch. Pretty convincing. The best star actor, huh? Look! That's gross! What if he dies like that? Fuck! Don't fall for it! Are you stupid? If he dies, we're fucked! We get nothing! Just buy him one pill? Can't you even do that? I told you to shut up, bitch! Wait! Stop. Zoom in, please. It's him. I'm sorry. I can't give you the keys just because you say you're his agent. If something goes wrong, it'll be my fault. Hey. You work hard to live, huh? - Buying something? - I ran out of soy sauce. Welcome. I'll be back. Put Hwang on. - What? - He's practically dying. I came out to get some pills. He's putting on an act! Don't you get it? You have to see him, boss. He's drooling and even pissed his pants! If he dies, we're fucked. Use your head, you fuckin' moron! I'll pull your tongue out and burn you to hell! Listen. Call me back within three minutes, and put him on! If you're late one second, I'll cut off all your fingers. Sick psycho son of a bitch. When I get the money, I'll kill you! Son of a bitch! Welcome. Mister! Oh no! Is he dead? Oh shit! What do I do? Untie his hands first! No! I can't. Hurry up! Shit! Hurry! You have to save him! Do CPR! Do CPR to save him! Hurry! Shh! It's okay. Quiet. Are you okay? Let's go. Come on. Run! Run! Run! Push! Come on! Let's talk. Please let us go. I promise I won't report this. You lying asshole! Come on! - What the fuck! - Baby! Shit! Let go, bastard! Shit! Stop it! Set-byeol! Fuck! No! Come on! Run! No! Oh shit! Listen to me. At this rate, we'll both be caught. I'll lure them away. You hide here, then run away when it's clear. It's okay. You can do it. Okay? Shh. Don't move. Is this how you treat a fan? Don't move. Freeze, you son of a bitch! INCORRECT PASSWORD The person you are calling is unavailable… - That's it! 4064. - Right. Excuse me! Wait! Wait a minute! Wait! I'm Detective Jang of Seoul Metro Police. May I see your ID, please? Why? We're investigating a case. Please cooperate. I don't have to show my ID for random questioning. What if we took you to the station? Choi Ki-wan? Choi. Put your hands up. Hands up. You're scaring me. I said hands up! I'll show you my ID. - Stop! - Hands up! Floor it. Are you okay? Suspect Choi Ki-wan is on the run! This is unit 12! Choi is headed for the intersection! - Stop the car, Choi! Pull over! - Choi Ki-wan! Smash 'em! Faster! Floor it! Hold tight! Look out! Step back. It's dangerous! Go back. It's dangerous. Get him! You bastards! Let go! I said freeze! It's a bomb! Are you okay? That bastard! Damn it! - Go that way. - Right! Over here, please! - Ko Young-lok! - What's your motive? - Why did you make the bomb? - How many accomplices are there? SEOUL METRO POLICE - We have to get inside. - Mr. Ko! A word please! Let us through! Are there other crimes you committed? - The café owner. - Pardon? We killed the café owner! Take him inside now! We killed the café owner! What else did you do? We abducted Hwang Jung-min! Hwang Jung-min, the actor? Why'd you abduct him? We abducted Hwang Jung-min! Hwang Jung-min! Shit… You borrowed $58,000 from a casino loan shark. It's because of this? You abducted and killed a man for this? Where are the hostages? Tell me! Where are they? Turn the camera off. Want a smoke? Ko Young-lok. I know guys like you very well. Got discharged, have no money and no one to take you in. So you hate the world. It's not your fault. You just did what Choi Ki-wan told you. Isn't that right? Young-lok. You're still young. You can lead a good life. I'll help you. Think of me as a brother and tell me. Where is Mr. Hwang Jung-min? Son of a bitch! Come in here now! He bit his tongue! Watch his head! - Open his mouth! - Call an ambulance! A house! - Sir? Sir? - Who are you? Please help me. I need your help. You're hurt badly. I'll get some medicine. No, sir! Listen. I've been abducted. Could you report it to the police? What? No. Could I borrow a phone? A cell phone? Use the phone in there. I hate cell phones. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir! Who would do that here in Sinseong-ri? Sir! Wait! Sir! Please open the door! It was first reported by YTN at 1645. PYEONGTAEK POLICE Then Ko Young-lok was arrested. Further reports will air on KBN, YTN, and MBC. This is what he was wearing when he went missing. Hello? Chief Park? He came to my house. I caught him. Come and see. I told you to stop calling, sir. There's no one threatening you. It's real this time. He came to kill me. Come and see for yourself! I'm busy, sir. I'm hanging up. Hello? Wretched fool! Detectives Oh and Jang, do the legwork. Detectives Yoo and Lee will work the desk. And... That old man! Fully support these two from Seoul Metro! Yes, sir! Damn asshole thinks he's so big. Sir! You're from the furniture workshop. Did you see a man with red skin and curly hair? Sir? Nope. I thought I heard someone inside. I said no! He sent you, didn't he? Bring him! This time, I'll cut his ear off! Get lost! Okay, okay. Let's go! - Confess your crime to the cops. - Cell phone, please! Good manners, huh? Took your shoes off to go inside? The country is shocked to learn of actor Hwang Jung-min's abduction. In a back alley late at night, the culprits attacked Hwang Jung-min with a stun gun. Ko, the arrested suspect, said they targeted expensive cars. Police have issued an open search on Choi Ki-wan and Yeom Dong-hoon. WANTED: SUSPECTS CHOI KI-WAN AND YEOM DONG-HOON We abducted Hwang Jung-min! Suspect Ko claimed they have abducted actor Hwang Jung-min. As the suspects' identities are known, the investigation is at large. Police are standing guard outside Mr. Hwang's house now. Shit. Hello? I'm at the laundromat for the money. Hwang played you for a fool. He told us the wrong code. Stupid asshole. Let's end this. Put the bastard on. Boss? Set-byeol is hurt badly. The shitheads shot her! So? So? I said Set-byeol got shot! So what! You fell for that crazy bitch and lost it! I gotta take Set-byeol to the hospital fast, sir. Give me my share first. Yeom Dong-hoon. Use your head, moron. The cops are onto our accounts. They're frozen. Wire it to here. I'll take 10% and give you the rest in cash. Yeom Dong-hoon. Put the bastard on now. I'll get you the money. I'll even pay for her hospital bills. You son of a bitch! Why keep changing the deal? You said you'd give me the café owner's cash too! You took it all, you bastard! Are you insane? You know what happens if you betray me. The hell with it! Stop fucking around, and bring my money now! If you don't come by 10:00 p.m., I'll kill 'em all. I'll kill you too. POLICE IDENTIFIED SUSPECTS THEY SHOULD BE HANGED! I BET IT'S A LIE. I ABDUCTED HWANG JUNG-MIN! You'll get caught, too. Boss isn't caught yet. Be quiet. I'm not talking to you. Abducting, murder… What do you think happens when you get caught? I'm not talking to you! I didn't kill anybody! I just did what I was told. Boss said he'll give me a lot, so I just followed orders. Hello? Boss? Put Hwang on now. Hey, Hwang! I'm outside your house. Give me the wrong bank code again, I'll cut your family to pieces. Really? You made the right choice. The police should be at my house by now. Turn yourself in there. You saw my movies, right? I played detectives and lawyers. If you get caught, you'll get sentenced to life. What the fuck? Wanna die? Yes, that's right. Just tell this man to let us go now. Then I'll tell the police to get you out earlier. I'll give you the money too. That's what you want, right? What? What money? - Who are you talking to? - The boss. Fuck! Stop it! You son of a bitch! Did you plan with Ki-wan to run away? And screw me over? No way. Boss would never betray us. The bastard said to free him! You loser! Think I'm a loser? You bastard! Traitors must die! You asshole! Die! Die! Die! Die! Please tell us how the investigation is currently being conducted. Yes. We're tracking down suspect Choi Ki-wan by analyzing CCTVs and questioning. Hey, mister. Are you in or out? Police assume Choi fled from Gangnam to Yeongdeungpo-gu. CHOI KI-WAN THOUGHT TO BE IN SEOUL Mister? My arms are asleep. It hurts. My arms feel dead. Do you know what? I started working on Monday. I got the job after 37 interviews. My dad was so happy. I auditioned over 100 times when I started acting. They all laughed at me for being an average looking man with red skin and a southern accent. There is so much I haven't done yet. I don't want to die. I really don't want to die. Who says you're going to die? You'll get out. Don't worry. Captain, we found the truck! It's dented as expected. We also have witnesses who saw the culprits getting in the taxi. We can track back from here and find their hideout. We got a tip on Choi's location. We'll go and get him. Get moving! There is no withdrawal yet from Hwang's account. We must catch them before they get the money. Right. You work on finding their hideout. What? - Hello. - But… On your way to find me? Seize him! Take him in! I regret it big time. If Hwang Jung-min wasn't a star, the cops would still be doing nothing. Think you're so clever, huh? If I didn't turn myself in, you wouldn't catch me. You surrendered because you know you can't get paid and will be caught. To pin it on the others and get a reduced sentence, you dirty son of a bitch. Right. I want 20 years less with $3,000 a month kept in holdings. You think that's possible? It'd better be. You don't have time. If I don't get back by 10:00 p.m., Yeom will kill them both. Any word from Pyeongtaek? We won't get the truck's route until tomorrow, sir. Let's take him. We have no other choice. He's buying time on purpose. We must save the hostages. Get up. You're the only one who knows where Mr. Hwang is? Prove it to us first. Wrong! We gotta agree upon a deal first. You bastard! Detective Koo! Stop! Take him out! Choi Ki-wan, listen to me. If the hostages die, even the President can't help you. They gotta be alive for you to have a deal. What'll it be? You should choose wisely. I gave you a choice. What? Let's not waste time. I'll rescue Hwang Jung-min for you. Choi Ki-wan revealed the hideout! Move out! The task force will go to the hideout. PYEONGTAEK POLICE Send all forces there. - Called the medical team? - They're on their way there. Let me go! Chief Park! Not him again. - Who is he? - Sir! He lives alone in the mountain. He's delusional. - Chief Park! - He calls and says someone will kill him. - He's a pain. - I'll catch that red-face fool! He says he was kidnapped! Let me go! Please go back, sir! I'll catch the red face for you! Let go of me! Wait a minute! Sir? Have you seen this man? Where are you going? We gotta wait for the boss. Wait till ten o'clock. Boss said to wait till ten o'clock. You don't want to make him mad. How much will you get? What? How much did Hwang Jung-min promise to give you, bastard! Think I don't know? Think I'm a loser like you? You son of a bitch! - Boss? You two can't fool me! - No way! No way, my ass! You shithead! You bastards killed Set-byeol. Why? If you'd paid up, it would've ended quietly. You were going to kill us from the start! You knew? The police caught one of your members. Then they'll come... Think you're so smart, huh! Stop. Please don't do this. Why? Wanna live? Then repeat after me. "Please let me live. I'm a bastard. Just kill the bitch, please." Say it. Then I'll let you live. Really? No, mister! You don't believe him, do you? Yes, I'll let you live. So say it. "Please let me live. I'm a bastard. Just kill the bitch, please." Don't be fooled, mister! He's lying! Be quiet! I have to live! How could you? "Please let me live. I'm a bastard! Just kill the bitch"… - How could you! - "I'm a bastard!" Just kill her! That's it! I knew you were an asshole! Your act made me sick! What are you doing? What are you waiting for! Hit him! I'm not a loser! I am not! Get up! Hurry! Are you okay? I'm sorry about earlier. - It's okay. - Look. I didn't kill anyone. It's for the money to fix this and pay my mom's hospital bills. I didn't kill anybody! Right. Thank you. Let's leave here together. Motherfuckers… Yeom Dong-hoon! Yeom Dong-hoon! Open up, Yeom Dong-hoon! Yeom Dong-hoon! Look here! Shit! THAT'S NOT THE HIDEOUT, SIR! COME TO FURNITURE WORKSHOP AT SINSEONG-RI SAN 15-1 You should've made the right choice. If something goes wrong, lure 'em here and blow 'em up. That sick psycho! - Let's go in. - Okay. Requesting backup at Sinseong-ri furniture workshop. It's over Yeom Dong-hoon! Drop the gun! Fuck you! I'll blow his head off! It's okay. Just drop the gun. Stop! No! Stay back! Save the bitch! Stay away from me! - Are you okay? - Your gang is all caught, but you. Just put the gun down. Cut the crap! Stay back! - Stop! Close the door! - Freeze! You bastard! - Yeom Dong-hoon! - You son of a bitch! Come back! Get in! Get in now! Drive. Choi Ki-wan! Let go! You bastard! Come on! I'll kill you then rip your family to shreds! Try it! Try it, asshole! Son of a bitch! Mr. Hwang! It's over. Let go of him! Let go! Actor Hwang Jung-min and the abducted girl were safely rescued by the police last night. Fortunately, both of them were confirmed to be unharmed. Now, they are in stable condition at the hospital. The police arrested all the suspects… 2 YEARS LATER Mr. Park Sung-woong? Think it's unfair? Good work. - What's the next scene? - It's scene 71, sir. Scene 71. - Mr. Hwang is here. - Where? Long time no see, man! What's with the beard? - Have a drink. - Thanks. Are you sure you're okay? Stop asking. I came because I'm fine. Everyone I meet asks if I'm okay as if they expect me not to be. When will you start working again? Soon. You're all dead. I'll get right back on top. You're scaring me. Let me in, huh? Hello, sir. He's new. He plays the killer. Similar, huh? I'm Hur Nam-joon, sir. What a great casting job, huh? Sir? It's time to rehearse. - Already? - Yes, sir. I'll finish up quickly. Let's get wasted at the pub here. Sir? Do you mind taking a picture with me? I'm sorry. Maybe next time. No, it's okay. Let's take it. - Thank you, sir. - I'll take it. Ready? Look here, please. One, two, three! Subtitle translation by: Esther Kwon
