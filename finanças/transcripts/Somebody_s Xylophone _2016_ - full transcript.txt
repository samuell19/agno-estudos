だれかの木琴 Somebody's Xylophone (2016) Breakfast is ready. Hurry up, you'll get late. Yes. Wow, potato miso soup. Come on, I often cook it. Hey, even flat beans. The regular recipe. Thank you for the meal. -Go ahead. Thank you for this meal. That miso soup base is delicious. You can get it from the supermarket. I know. See you next week. I'll call you. -Good. Thank you. Your bag and your coat. Alright. This way please. -OK. It's been a while. -Indeed. See how much it's grown. About 15cm longer. Is that a fire? They're going towards the station. That's the second this month. In the day time? Yes, that's strange, right? Maybe an arsonist. But an arsonist in broad day light... right, it's so strange. There, thank you for your patience. So, how do you like it? Thanks, it's perfect. Good. And here's your change, $25. Thank you. This is our member's card and... and if you want to require me next time. Great, I'll give you my card then. I had one made for a school reunion. Ah, thank you. We just moved in the neighborhood, I came here by chance. Really? We're very grateful. So, your name is read Oyaumi, Mrs. Oyaumi, is that right? Would you mind if we sent you information occasionally? Please do. I'd be glad to receive advice about make-up too. Sure, if you'd like that. So your name is Mr. Yamada Kaito? Right. That's a pretty sounding first name... Kaito. I appreciate that. Alright then. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. That new customer... she was kind of cool. Sorry I kept you waiting. This way. Pierre de Ronsard (XVIth C. France) "Cutie, let's go see... the rose that opened this morning..." "her crimson figure to the sunshine." "Has she already lost this evening..." "the grace of her curves..." "and her complexion as delicate as yours? " "Oh, what happened in such little time?" "Cutie, look how she has dropped her beauty..." "part by part on the ground." "Now, really, Mother Nature?..." Please disable the alarm system. The system is now disabled. Yes. Yes I'm home. Alright, sure. Hello. Madam. I'm sorry to intrude, Madam. You want coffee? Thanks, I'm fine. I just had one. I prepare some for later. Could you come over to here for a while? What is it, Sir? You went to the hair salon? Yes, a new place. I love the scent. Hey. Sir, what are you doing? Hey, come on. It's not appropriate here. You really don't want coffee. Gotta go. You got used to the alarm system? Well, doing my best. Next door in the neighborhood... a young person was concerned... I recommended her the same system as ours... she trusted me and now she's quite satisfied. You did good, that was the right decision. It's yours. It's from the salon. Business mail? I'm going. This haircut, I love it. Thank you, see you tonight. Dear Mrs. Oyaumi Sayoko. Thank you for your visit today. I hope you are satisfied. Yes, I'm very satisfied. I'm looking forward to seeing you again. Yamada Kaito from Mint Hair Salon. Can I have this muffin? -Sure. I'll warm it up. -I like it cold. Today we rehearsed for the chorus competition. Did you sing well? We're not there yet. Really? I'll take this to my room. -Sure. Don't spill anything. -I'll be careful. Dear Mr. Yamada Kaito... I really enjoyed the shampoo and the cut today. I'll be sure to request you next time. Oyaumi Sayoko She's that customer you mentioned. She's replying to a business mail? How odd. Indeed. Make sure she comes back. Sure. Thank you for your reply. The scissor on the pic is like my samurai weapon. You will be relying on it next time. Oh, a samurai weapon. Say Kanna, can I take a pic with the phone? What? Of course, you can take pics with all the phones. I'd send it by text? You can but the pic could be small. How small? Transfer it to the PC to send it. Can you use a PC? -I think I can. You're going to send a pic by mail? Grandma hasn't seen this house yet. Grandpa could receive it on his smartphone. Ah, a smartphone. Say, Dad... Forget it. They all have one. -You don't need to look like them all. Madame, would you mind having a look? Sure. -Please. The lady is here. There, were done. Wow, it's big. Is it good like this? It's perfect. If you could sign, please. This sheet is for you. Thank you. -Thank you. Thank you for the samurai weapon pic. Even a housewife is quite busy. Today I received a new bed. Setting it was exhausting. Sending you a pic. Sending the photo of her bed to a total stranger? Chief, the boss asked for you. He's in Meeting Room 3. I'm going now. -Just between you and me... he was talking about promoting you to Section Chief. Miss Kishita, I'd like to offer you lunch some day. Great, would you mind if I bring another secretary along? Ah,... well, sure if it's just one more. I'm looking forward to it. The photo of her king size bed? Did you reply? -Nope. It's an invitation, of course. Oh, come on. Why would she send that pic? She's totally into you, love at first sight. She's nothing to me. What? Don't do that to me. -What? So typical, a handsome hairdresser with a customer. I'm handsome now? Silly. -You are. I am? You're gonna miss the last train. See you. Don't cheat on me. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Good morning. She had a haircut just 2 weeks before. She said on the phone she needed a little cut. I have this school reunion coming up. Everyone will be looking at everyone else. Yes, that's why I came. You'd be fine with just a brushing, but you want a little cut? Yes, please. Excuse me. Do you know a good place to eat? There are so many around here. I often go to 'the Owl', although it's a bar... the food is good too. 'The Owl'? -Right. You see the rail-crossing there, you cross it... you'll see the bar facing the station, it's easy. I live a minute walk from there. So even when I'm drunk I can crawl back. My rent is not too high. But it's a residence of cute, small houses. You have a great voice, Mr. Kaito. Thank you. Bakery? -Bakery. Come on, I can hardly see you on this one. It's not that I want you to take a pose. -OK, next time. You let me take a better shot next time. And frontal please. That customer again? You're very inquisitive, boss. What does she say? She had a junior college reunion. You need to value such customer. I do value her, but there's something... Mrs. Takahashi is there who requested you. Alright. Hello, this is Mint Hair Salon. Hello? Hello, this is Mint... Please, excuse me a minute. Could you wait a minute, please? Hello, this is Mint Hair Salon. Hello. I'll pick up next, you can go back. Sorry about that. Yes, hello?... Hello? Hey, Kanna. I'm going out. Where? I left an article in a shop. Alright then. 'The Owl', Japanese style dishes. It's a minute walk from 'the Owl'. a little house. Yamada Were not hearing the firetruck lately. Indeed, maybe they caught the arsonist. "I'm 22, unemployed, an only child." "I was quite average at high school." What's that? I'm trying to profile the arsonist. You're striking a chord there. I was quite a bad boy at 22. You burned up stuff. -Dude, no. People are not the sheep we think, 22 or more. You're probably right. I have my evil moments too. There you are. Right now I'm evil. Right, I'll pour myself one too. How long have you been running the Owl? Well, about 5 years. You don't seem sure. What's that Yui, you have your own key, no? I bought too much, I thought I'd share some with you. Please enjoy, Oyaumi Sayoko What's that? I go to 'the Owl' bar because I live a minute away. I am an idiot. I'm such a chatterbox. What does she want. Yes. Yes, what is it? Please, wait. It's your hairdresser. OK. Yes, hello? I'm sorry about that. I hope it didn't cause you trouble. If it's a problem just trash them. Right, sure, sorry. I sent them strawberries, the salon wanted to thank me. Strawberries? But in our fridge there are... none. I shouldn't have called. Hello. You want an appointment? Sure. Mr. Yamada is taking care of you, right? No, it's OK, he'll be expecting you. Kaito, tomorrow 4 pm, Mrs. Oyaumi. Boss. What did you just say? What was that exactly? There was a sign of life in an empty house. A window was open on the second floor. I thought, there could be a small girl. A very young girl. Alone in the room. Playing the xylophone, randomly beating it. It's Tuesday today. I'm sure he said Tuesday was his day off. Switching the alarm to watch mode, have a nice day. The owl. Yes, I'm Yamada. Well... Hello. Hello. Something happened? No, I was just walking by, I thought... well, it's not cleaned but, come in. I'm sorry, I didn't intend to... Wait, I'm sorry. You're really mean to me. What? That woman scared me. Did you see her eyes? What's that about? A married woman is stalking Kaito. I'm not interested in this. I'd like to hear it. OK guys, have it without me. She barged in Kaito's place. Wow, she spooked you? She didn't stay long. But on top of that... her middle school daughter comes to the salon too. It's all fine, it's good business. It seems the boss mistook you for your mother on the phone. So you're with me. So you're my mom's hairdresser. Yes I am. Please feel comfortable. Tension makes your hair harder. Really? I'm just kidding. Your hair is really similar to your mom's. More your hair than your features. It's often the case. I don't want to look like her. That too is often the case for middle-schoolers. Paradoxically, they often say that they love their mom... but still don't want to look like her. That's right. -Yes. But middle-schoolers lie sometimes. OK, I'll start. OK. Excuse me. The mom or the daughter, neither have a stalker profile. Oh, but they are stalkers. Did you hear him? Why did she come to your place. -It wasn't planned. Hey, wait, Yui-chan was there too. What were you doing before she came? I'm wondering about it. -Don't be naughty. So you were being naughty. I didn't say that. Who is it? A delivery? Yes, I'm Yamada. Well. Hello. Hello. Something happened? No, I was just walking by, I thought... Well, it's not cleaned but, come in. I'm sorry, I didn't intend to... Wait. Wait, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't intend to... I didn't want to invade your privacy. I was passing by, I saw your house and... I'll be on my way, now. We don't mind, it's OK. I so wanted to know who Mrs. Oyaumi was. I've heard so much about you. No, I'm not talking about you. On the contrary, you are a hot topic, Madame. That is not the case... we don't gossip about our customers. Oh, by the way, your daughter came to the salon yesterday. What? -Well... Since she introduced herself as Oyaumi, I was automatically assigned to her. Is that right, I didn't know. When did that happen? Well that was yesterday. Mother and daughter using your service, that's amazing. It's not 'amazing'. What is your husband doing? Now you're preying. He's a regular office worker. What's 'wonderful' about that? Kanna is my daughter. She's my family. Going to the same salon... there's nothing amazing about that. As she was walking under the rain... I had this vision of her going away. What was happening in her life? "Breaking-in alert... bee... bee..." "Sending a breaking-in signal to the police." Hello. Sorry, I forgot. I'm sorry, I can't hear. I'm the lady of the house, Oyaumi Sayoko. Ah, right, the code. Wait a minute. 128LS and then 39. Which button? OK. "This is the end of the control." Hey, nobody home? Mom has a fever. I fell asleep. I'm home. -Welcome back. You OK? I went out in the rain. You have a fever? -I'm fine. I look awful. You took a pill? -Yes. I'll go talk to Kanna a minute. Kanna. What? Did you eat something? -No. Let's eat out. How's Mom? She'll be alright. Kanna is hungry, we'll eat out. Shall I bring you something? Yogurt. That's it? You need to eat. I'll find something. The street is still wet, be careful. Say dad... What? Since it is your trade, tell me... you think we really need that security system? Can't we just lock properly? It's a tricky issue, I'll just give you two angles: One. In Tokyo, a family of 4 was murdered in a breaking-in. That was before you were born. They never arrested the murderer. That's my first angle. Two. I don't think there are so many robbers... but I'm always concerned to leave two females alone in that house. You get it? But... What? Apart from that, crimes that take place within the house. Sure... What? You fear for us? -It's not like that. Family problems are complex. But... no security system in the world... will ever solve that kind of problem. Let's go, we're hungry. ... can turn at will into a fox or a bird. That's difficult. -A brand new model. Would be great, right? A best seller. You're always talking about transformations, dad. Mom, you should be in bed. I was going to bring it to you. -I'm fine. My fever is gone, I can't stay in bed. Dad is warming up a rice porridge. You can't just take yogurt. Thanks, a porridge will be great. Coming right away. What did you you guys eat out? A pizza. -You're content with that? It was delicious. There you are. Thank you. OK, I'll go upstairs. Sorry, I didn't cook dinner. It's fine. Oh, I forgot... you left a salon's business card there. So I made an appointment at Mint... and look. They thought I was you on the phone... Oh, I didn't notice. They assigned me the same employee, he's great. Unlike the previous salon they didn't treat me like a kid. That's great. I'm going to bed. Good night. Mint Salon, they called the other day, right? That's right. It's delicious. So, today at 5:30, Miss Ikota will take care of you. Yes, we'll be expecting you, bye. Welcome. You have an appointment?. -No I don't. OK, wait a minute, please. Hello. Sorry, I'd rather have a lady. Well, if you could wait for 40 min a lady will take care of you. Isn't she available? Sorry, she isn't certified yet. If I have no choice. -Sorry. I'll take your bag and your coat, please. Thank you. This way please. What do you have in mind? A 3 mm cut. What? -As I said, just 3 mm. If it's exactly 3 mm... -You can't? It's not like I can use a ruler. In that case you don't need a hairdresser, you need a barber. I'm not happy with the barber, and it's expensive, so I came here. Alright then. Excuse me. Excuse me, I'm used to that kind of cut. So you can do it? I'll try, I'm not sure 100% though. Is that OK? I wasn't requesting a cut with a ruler. Sure, I'll go ahead then. My apologies. Excuse me. Funeral plate for departed infant. A total of $48, please. On a $50 bill? -Yes. Let me give you the change. Do you want our member's card? -No thanks. $2 change and your receipt. Thank you for your visit. This man just wanted female hands to touch him. You're probably right. Poor guys has no other way to approach a woman. What is it? I didn't figure you as such a tender heart, Miyuki. You didn't know. -I didn't. I can touch you too. -Hey, this is scalding hot. It's amazing how you found this place. You said it: the stairs at Jingumae Station... the boutique with the English name. Did I say that? I asked around for a BABY-something shop, it's very famous. We have many customers. This one. You want this one? -Yes, this one. Would you like to try it on? -No it's fine. That will be $527. I'll pay with my card. -Sure. Say... What's that? Uh? The dress on the bed. Sorry, I should have put it away. I bought it at a friend's boutique. I had to buy something. But that kind... -I know it's queer. Maybe Kanna would like it. Otherwise we'll trash it. What? Trash it? But she came to the boutique... and she bought a white dress. She didn't even try it on. If she had I would have been embarrassed. You don't see why? Come on. Sorry. I feel weird today. It's OK. Could we just cuddle a little? That little girl is looking for the music within her. She would like to become music herself. But it's not working. That annoyed her. That little girl there... is me. That's the little girl I was. Then he came home one night... and for the first time he saw his wife... wrapped in an Indian sari shaking her hips and dancing. She saw him and kept going... and shaking hips and neck singing "Hare hare... ". He was about to call the hospital, she laughed at him. She got that dress at a bargain sale. An odd episode, but still it's kind of a normal behavior. Well, different people would have different angles. Some psychologists see a grain of madness in women's nature. What do you mean? Well it's just as I said, it's written in a book. And I read there that men's nature drives them to become women. You get that Oyaumi? How can I put it... Well, I don't get it. The folklore speaks about women's madness. Women possessed by a fox's spirit. -Even men. How told you that? -My grandma when I was a kid. And that night you wet your bed. -That's right. Are there still women possessed by foxes? They changed the name. People in the villages coined the word 'possessed'. Now we call it 'whatever-oses' and commit them to institutions. Thank you for this meal. -Good night. I'm going home. How about a bar? -We have to go. Please come dine at my place, next. My wife's a good cook. It will be a pleasure, thank you. Alright. -Good night. Did you catch a cold? No. People don't see your face with that mask. You look goofy, just take it off. Hey, don't catch me like that. It's not like that. So what is it? -I changed my mind. Hey, let's go some place, a bar, a hotel. Which one do you like? I like both. We didn't mention money. I'm not in that trade. Really? That's a surprise. If I was I would have asked for a condom. What's your name? Today, it's Kaoru. -Today? Lol. I don't know about tomorrow. Just Kaoru? -Right. If it's not your trade why do you...? Well, the truth is... do you want to hear my life? Not necessarily. I'm not good at made up stories. I get it. What? I'm taking out the trash. What? That late? Sent mail Yamada Kaito. There are tens of them. I ordered the treatment you advised me. Looking forward to it. What's your relationship, guys? This is not ours. MINT Is that right? Is that him? Yamada Kaito? But someone else could take care of her. -No way. You're still up? I was worried about you. -Sorry, I went for a little walk. I'm going to bed. She was that silent caller, right? You have no way to prove that, boss. Don't send her mails anymore. But I never did. -She is responding though. Well, she'll have to give up eventually. Come on, I don't think so. But someone else could take care of her. -No way. What? For these housewife's the person they chose is special. Some come once a week for a shampoo, a cut, especially for an employee. You think you see a simple person... but nowadays people harbor a deep sadness. What's that? maybe, I wasn't too good last time? Oh no, I don't think that. So why can't we do it today? We'll just have a drink? Well... there's no special reason. You like riddles. -Do I? You don't offer explanations. So many things can't be expained with words. But I like to solve riddles. I don't dislike such type of men. Shall I meet you there again by chance? I don't know. Sorry, gotta go. Thank you for the drink. What's your name today? Kaoru. Please, take good care of your wife. I am taking good care of her. At least I got that notion. Hello. Please, I need a cut and a shampoo with Mr. Yamada Kaito. Your appointment? -I don't have one. Is he not working today? He is, please wait an instant. I'll be right back. Kaito, Mrs. Oyaumi is here for you. I'll put these away. Hello. This way. What will it be? I want a cut. -How do you want it? How do you want it? How do you want it? I want it short. -Short? How short? Real short, a man's cut. A man's cut? -Yes. Please excuse me for a while. Forgive me, I had to ask my boss. Why did you need him? This is a delicate situation... sometimes the person is shocked by the result... and I get into trouble. I'm not that type... he said you should write a discharge. So I'll write it. But that's what the boss said while I... I don't like that method. Please, tell me your decision again. A men's haircut could be almost anything. I'll trust you. Then I'll ask you as I proceed. Like, roughly, would my hair style be OK? Sure. I get it. Thank you. You can come anytime Yamada. -Ah, thank you. The lights will be out in 15 min. We'll go drink next time. Welcome. Uh? You're alone? He isn't here yet? He's not answering his phone. You are drunk. Have a glass of water. Nope. What? Ah, good evening. What are you doing here? I'm drinking. You're hair is shorter. That often happens... a woman getting a short cut when she's dumped. So common. And who cut your hair? Yui-chan, enough. Yui-chan. What happened to your hair? You're still home? You'll be late for school. Answer my question. I wanted a short haircut. Who did it? Is it Yamada Kaito? It was his day off. A female employee did it. And then where have you been at night? I'm sorry, did you manage to dine? I can prepare food for myself. You should rush to school. I'm not going today. Eh? Why? What's the scratch on your face? It's nothing. Where have you been at night? Kanna. What? I'm your mother... but I have a life of my own. What's that? You should ponder on that. But you're still my mom, right? Why don't you answer your child's questions? You were out late at night. I wasn't that late. You were sleeping, right? -I was awake. Dad came back at midnight and you at 2 am. What will become of this family? Mom, are you cheating on dad? I'm certainly not. You're going to a place? I'm not going to 'a place'. What am I supposed to do? Dad... can you talk now? Please come back soon today, Dad. Mom is not herself... she had her hair cut short. Anyway... please come back home soon today. Dad... an incident happened inside our home. Quite a move you did there... with your hair. I'm very happy with it. It suits you, it's a fresh impression. Glad you like it. What's that scratch? I played with the cat next door. Be careful... there are all types of cats out there. I used disinfectant, it's nothing. I went to Kanna's room earlier. She was emotional. But she didn't say anything. It's a misunderstanding. What misunderstanding? She thought I was planning to leave this house. Are you? Eh? What are you saying Ko-san? What exactly did she misunderstand? Nothing I would have done. Taking the trash at night... your encounter with this cat, etc. I have several points of concern too. But it's the truth, that night I took out the trash... and then I walked alone. Are you... sometimes feeling lonely? I don't. You know what? We should go on a trip. With Kanna. She said she'd love a family trip. Before ringing that bell I'm telling you again: Don't do that, let's go back. Now, it's my problem now, stay out of this. Just go if you don't like it, just go back. Who would come that late? Welcome. Welcome? Are you mocking me? Please don't be so loud... Mr. Kaito, did something happen with her? What kind of game is that. Your hubby is here, right? Call him. I'll tell him what's going on. Could you calm down a bit? I'll let myself in. -Hey, come on. Sorry, for the late hour. Are you her husband. I am... and who are you? Do you know what your wife is doing? Your wife is a stalker. She went to Kaito's house, she even came to my shop. Do something, she's your wife after all. Wait a minute. You can't barge in and make a scene here. What's that story? First off. Who are you? I told you your wife... -You're too loud. Calm down before you talk. You're wife is a stalker and she's following me around. Nonsense, it can't be true. What's that? My wife is certainly no stalker. What are you saying? -You heard me. My wife is certainly no stalker. And first... who are you? Are you delusional, dude. I'll tell you clearly... what your old hag is scheming. Now we're going. -I'm not done. Let me go. No, no. I'm sorry. Where did you learn to call ladies, 'old hag'. Tell me who taught you that word? You use your polite words with your customers and 'old hag' with mine? What the hell? We're fine. What is it? You don't sit down? Sorry, I've caused you trouble. Sorry, I was obsessed with my job. I had no idea how hard you work. You're not supposed to know. I have no one else but you Kotaro-san. What about Kanna? She's a beautiful chick on her way out of the nest. The Americans have this expression, 'son of a bitch'. In any country people need to express these words sometimes. I just said 'old hag', can't you forgive it to me? Are we breaking up just because of that? When you're mad and you can't hold it... go to the bathroom and say it on your own. You don't say that to people's face. Day after day we are taught to treat them like queens... I'm tired of faking it. How can you be always so naturally cool? I'm neither cool nor 'naturally' cool. Don't you want to burst sometimes? You see... long ago someone said 'old hag' to my mom. I hit the guy, he had to be hospitalized, I was 22. You are projecting your mom on her. What are you leading to? You love this pretty wife. You're leading the conversation to that again? Hey? Please don't make me give up on our couple. How far is this going to go? Let's split. If we don't I'll get angry like I used to. I can't read. It's OK. I don't get what your writing in my back. Send me a text. I'm writing with undecipherable symbols. Only these can convey important feelings. Again with your riddles. What do you mean 'again'? Nothing special. Woman have to use riddles sometimes. I don't get it. Just beware. Kaito. A letter for you. It's anonymous. A threatening letter maybe? No doubt it's a love letter. Mr. Yamada Kaito... Sorry, to bother you with this letter... since my mom has visited Mint Salon... her state has been hectic. I believe she turned that way because of you. Neither of us will be returning to Mint Salon. Please don't write to my mother anymore. If you met her by chance, don't talk to her. Oyaumi Kanna Alright, I'll do just that. Sorry. Say, Mom... What? I found a great salon today. Really? It's just 3 minutes away from my school. 'Heart' was written on their sign in English. Though they have only female employees, I think. I'll wait until you try it, I'll go if you like it. I'll go tomorrow, please give me money. You already spent it all? Well, I do have expenses you know. Even when I don't want to hurt... the mere fact that I am there... I end up hurting people. Is that my fate? Switch the TV on, quick. The news says, that arsonist has been arrested. The suspect has been apprehended. Fire setting items have been found with him. He's been apprehended today. Without a fixed address and unemployed... Tokunaga Saburo is 22. The investigation... Hey, isn't he the 3mm-cut customer? You're right, that's the guy. I knew there was something peculiar about him. Incredible, I gave a haircut to an arsonist. Unbelievable. He was arrested at a friend's place. According to the police, Mr. Tokunaga... had been employed in a Temp agency in Tokyo a year before... and since then didn't find a job. "I'm 22, unemployed" No fixed address, what kind of life did he lead? The investigation is following that lead. Welcome. Hey, it's been a while. So you're still alive. -I was dead. Come sit at the bar. What shall it be? A draft beer. -Oh, that's unusual. Haven't seen you much around. Yui-chan, don't be rude. Ah, you're talking to me? It's only the second time I come. Your name is Mr. Takizawa, right? Are you a regular here? Not that much. Don't be cold, you're a familiar. Well, I used to be, but I stayed away for a while. I just moved here. I'm Takizawa. Pleased to meet you, I'm Shindo Yui. Yui didn't call after that... Mrs. Oyaumi's texts stopped too. Today I'm 25. No doubt my mom will call. If I tell her I'm preparing for a hairdresser's contest... she'll be worried again. "What if you fail", she'll ask. Though there's nothing to fail. Tuesday, my day off. I slept all day. I told you already. It's not an exam it's a contest. No one fails at these. Why would I get fired? Absolutely, I may even get a prize. Yeah, sorry, I was sleeping. I have been studying all night. I received your box last night. Thank you. So, how's everybody? Great, I'm glad for you. I get it, I get it. OK, I gotta go. Well, I'm too busy to come. I'm really busy. Alright then. Yeah, thanks. Shindo Yui You're Mrs. Oyaumi's... Mr. Yamada Kaito. Yes. I think... you're a great hair stylist. When I'll be an adult, I'd like you to cut my hair. How about that? Here, your 20c. Thank you. The two colleagues we invited last night... Yes? Mr. Tashiro and Mr. Iijima. That guy, Tashiro... Yes? He couldn't stop praising your cooking talents. I'm so glad. I thought we could invite him over with 3 others on the weekend. In all we'll be 7 at the table, right? I know, it's quite a chore. No, don't worry I'll manage, it's fine. They're all bachelors living on frozen food, anything you cook will be great. It's alright, I'll cook delicious dishes. You're great, thank you. Tonight I'll be home at 7. Hi. A Japanese restaurant would be good. Mr. Tashiro Tsuyoshi... I'm Sayoko, Mr. Oyaumi's wife. We had a great evening last week. I heard you praised my cooking and now I'm getting shy... but I'll be delighted to entertain you again. Oyaumi Sayoko "Cutie, let's go see the rose..." Okuda Tamio "Latest news"
