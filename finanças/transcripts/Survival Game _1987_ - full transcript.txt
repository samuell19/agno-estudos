[lion roaring] [dramatic orchestral music] [suspenseful music] [guns firing in distance] Over here! [booming in distance] [gunfire rattling in distance] How are we gonna get across? The cable. I said the cable, now move it! [whistling and booming in distance] So, the rest of us could cross here. Bing, go back by the bridge, set up diversionary fire a minute from now. Go. Bernstein, you're first up. Do it. [gunfire rattling in distance] Denunzia, you're next. Eh, I don't think so, Pierce. Move it. Now. Pierce, ow! [gunfire rattling in distance] [machine guns firing] Help, help! [bell ringing] -Shit! -What's wrong? Somebody's stuck on the table. I'm gonna go down there. Help! All games are hereby terminated. All players near the cable crossing, prepare to lend assistance as necessary. All games are hereby terminated. Ah, help! Help me! Pierce, help! Help me, help me! Hold on, son. Hold on, now there's Michael. Help! Pull up! I can't! Bullshit, you can! Help! Hang on, Denunzia. Grab me! Yup, yup! Yeah, he's got him! [screaming] Hold him. Hang on Denunzia, hang on. Hold on!

Pretty bad. Might've been worse. Come on, let's go. Hey, nice work. All right. Okay. Michael. What are we doing this weekend? Working here, what else? No, no, that was last weekend. Oh Sugar Bear, don't get started. Michael! I'm getting tired of seeing your face around here. I'd like to see you in college. Hell, yeah, yeah. And so would my mom. Yeah, I know. I want to ask you something. Why did you continue to hang around with an old retired grunt like me? I can't even pay you a decent wage. Sugar Bear. I'll tell you why, because you're good at playing war games. You got a good talent for it. Everything you do here smiles back at you. You need to get serious, get off your butt, give it a chance and go back to school. Hey, Sugar Bear. Give me a little space, all right?

Dr. Dave is being released today from maximum security Solidad state prison. You may remember him back in the sixties. I was just a young kid of 16 at that time, he was convicted. [buzzing] Hey, fellas. [people chattering] It's been a long time in. -Good luck to you, I mean it. -Thank you very much, Lorne. Dr. Dave, what do you plan to do with your freedom? Freedom, I'm going to see -if it exists. -Dr. Dave! Who has all the money? Money, they only gave me 200 dollars. You got any? Oh come on we heard two million. The two million sir, is that it? Dave, where's your daughter? She gonna be here? Where'd you get those, from Puccini? You look like Madame Butterfly. Just keep writing your lies anyway. How does it feel to be out after 17 years? It's beginning to feel great. Hey, Fletcher! Yo! Take it easy, Dave! I'm still as lovely. Dave, what do you have to say to the kids today? What, babe, don't drink. Isn't that the worst drug there is? Check your own statistics. It kills more than... [drowned out by chattering] Hey, sir. That's fine, Dave. Can you give us some room here please? Excuse us here, please. -Dave! -Excuse us, please.

Dave Forrest's daughter. Will you be seeing him any time in the future? [laughing] Oh goddamn, David, it's good to have you back. -Welcome home. -Ah, it's good to be back. Thank you. God, it's good to see you out here. It's great to be out. God is good to be out. It's so goddamn good to be out. Driver a little faster, please. I want to lose that place as quick as I can. Ooh! When I was going on the merry-go-round yesterday you have to go round, sign out at all these places. The hacks were all saying to me, "Hey Dave, where are you going with the money? You're going to the islands, Dave? You gonna get an Island? Where are you going to spend the two million?" I told him, "Don't worry about it." I said, "If I got 2 million I'll let my accountant do it for me." Dave, I want you to listen to me. That $2 million is a 17 year old problem that is just not going away. Something has to be done about that. Charles, you know and I know there was never any two million. I made Fire for people to have a good time with. I gave it away. I never sold any of it. Dave, Dave, I know that. Hey, CJ. -Hi Lee, how you doing? -Have a good one. Oh, Roscoe! There. Hi, Rosa. Yeah. Did my father get back yet? He didn't? Oh, well, I'm going to be working tonight at the Egg cafe. So ask him to come by there, okay? Is this it? Is this where you live? What, it's not much, Dave, but it's home. It looks a bit lonely to me. Howard, you sure you can't stay for supper? Things to do, people to see. Oh, Michael! Hi, Mike. Hi, Howard. Have you seen Howard's new commercial, darling? -No, no, afraid not, Howard. -It's okay. We got channel five covered day and night. Tune in, you can't mess it. Howard was just leaving. You sure you have to get back so soon? Got to deliver on my promises. Business can't run itself. Oh I guess you're right. See you, Barb. Good seeing you, Howard. [beeping] What's that? My new commercial. Come on! If we hurry we can catch it. Come on, darling. Come on, it's fun. Ma, listen, I need to- Shh, shh. [tense music] [woman screaming] It's me. You called? Here comes the good part. Stand back. This is a job for the Exterminator! [creatures screaming] Those aren't real. Thank you, you saved my life. I won't be back. So what'd you think? Yes Michael, what did you think? That was fine, Howard. Fine, excuse me. Michael, what's with you? Mom, I was trying to tell you. I had an accident in the Mustang. What, are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. But the fender's on the disabled list. Oh Michael, why can't you be more careful? Mom, it wasn't my fault. This girl, she plowed right into me. Women drivers for ya. Her insurance is gonna cover it. Michael, that is not the point. I trusted you with my car. Piece of junk, needs some bodywork anyway. That piece of junk happens to be my car, and I happened to be very fond of it. Now, since you decided not to go to college maybe you should get yourself a real job and buy your own car. I'll take care of it, all right? When? Tonight, it's covered. Michael, I don't want to butt in, but- Then don't, Howard. Boy seems under a lot of pressure. Good luck, Dave. You're not coming? [laughing] No, I'm not coming. This is between you and CJ. All right. It's going to be all right. Now listen, when you're ready, you give me a call. I'll come pick you up. Yeah, all right. Right. Davie. Dave! -Hey Matt! -How are ya? How are ya? Oh my God, look at you! -I'm great. -Oh god, you look... Off. Well, thanks. Obvious you're jealous of my beauty. Is this tie dye? Look at this. What is this? -That's a beer belly, huh? -Little paunch. Little paunch, little paunch. A little shading in the beard? Listen, I got a table for you right here. -Right here. -All right, sit right down. Saved it just for you. You sure did. Where's CJ? She's in the back. So what can I get you? You know what I'd really like? Name it. I want it. Max, I've been dreaming for years about one of those big fat soy burgers. I remember Dave, but listen, you're kinda out of luck with that, you know? What? Well I mean, they're out of date. They went the way of love beads and peace marches. -You're kidding me. -No. Just give me a salad. A nice green salad with no iceberg lettuce because I still back Cesar Chavez, man. Right on. -Okay, salad. -All right. No, Caesar salad. -You got it, Max. -All right. Hey. Send out CJ, will you? You got it. Thanks. [gasping] [glass shattering] Don't you try anything. Relax, young lady. My name is McClean, FBI. Oh, FBI. Well, can I get you anything? A cup of coffee maybe? How about a search warrant? I'm here to talk about your father. But my father has paid his debt. So why don't you get off his case? His case is far from over. Are you talking about that money that he's supposed to have hidden away somewhere? It's a concern. There isn't any money Mr. McClean. Some people think there is. Well, those people are just going to have to deal with the disappointment now, aren't they? A couple of million dollars worth? Oh, come on! We're talking about dangerous people, Ms. Forrest, real dangerous people. Why don't you earn my taxpayers dollar then and lock them up? We can't make our move till they show their face. Oh, and you want to use my father as bait? No, forget it. My father is a free man now. He's got his whole life ahead of him. Ms. Forrest. You have no idea what's really involved here. But believe this. I am the very best friend you and your father have right now. Trust in that friendship, and you both may live to see Christmas. If you see or hear anything that doesn't sit right with you you call me. Day or night. Please take it. [lightly tense music] [light music] Max, did you see someone just- Listen, kiddo, there's somebody waiting to see you over at table 10. Go say hello, huh? [gentle music] Oh yeah. Look at this, oh. Let me take a peek. Yeah. Look at that beauty. -Oh, mmmmm. -Hi, Daddy, oh! God, it's good to see you. It is good to see you too, welcome out. Thank you. I missed you there today. I was there. You were gone. Dad, don't pull a guilt trip on me. Okay, okay, it's no biggie. Something wrong? Hmm? Something wrong? No, some jerk almost trashed my car today, that's all. -What? -Hi, remember me? -Jerks-R-Us. -What? What are you doing here? I came to talk to you about getting my car fixed. Now? It's not a good time. No, this is a very good time. Hey CJ, CJ. Why don't you introduce me to your dude here? He's not my, he's... Who are you, anyway? Name's Michael, Michael Hawkins. All right, sit down, Michael. You make me nervous standing up. Yeah, you should see him drive. You jump around too much. This is my father, David Forrest. Pleased to meet you, Michael. Dr. Dave? -I saw you on TV. -That's right. Guilty as charged, -time served. -Why don't you two just have a party? I'm going to go work. Hey, wait a sec. We have something to discuss here too. Have some bread. Feisty. Oh yeah, she's been like that all her life. So what's your trip, Michael? My trip? Yeah, you know, what are you into? What's your trip, what turns you on? Ah well, I play survival games. [laughing] You do huh? Well, don't we all? No, no, no, survival games. They're games, on weekends we play. Fake Wars, fake battles, fake blood, fake guns. It probably doesn't sound too interesting to you though. No, that's very interesting. I mean, I just spent 17 years with a bunch of fakes. What do you think, is survival into us? Are we into it? Metaphysical, my boy. Don't worry about it. Here you go, enjoy your dinner. I'll be back to talk with you in a little while. Artichoke, we said cantaloupe! Listen. Tonight is really a bad night for me, okay. I really don't think we can talk about this. No, I think this is a very good time for this. Please, Michael, it's not a good night. I'm trying to work here. Hey, if you two want to be alone, honey. It's okay with me. Daddy, we don't want to be alone. We're not together. We don't know each other. We just met. I don't know who this man is. Don't worry about it. I was young once. Daddy. What? Hey Max, look, I'm just really making a mess out of things tonight, okay? I gotta get out of here. Sure, kid, take a break, go ahead. So what's this about an accident? Well earlier today she hit my car. -while I was driving home. -Dad? -Nobody was hurt? -Good, here we go. Let's take care of it. Not you. -No, no, I'm Dad. -I'll talk to you later. I'm Dad. Enjoy my meal. Where do we begin, CJ? I mean, where do we start? I don't know. Guess we're supposed to go forward for now not look back. Hey, that's Bob Dylan. You know, Dad, I want you to be happy. I do, I really do. I'm happy. I'm really happy, CJ. I'm happy to be out. I'm happy to be here with you. I'm just happy. I've been by myself for a long time now. I don't know how to do this. Hey CJ, don't worry about it. It's just that old, mysterious, cosmic root of existence. I'm trying to have a real conversation with you about you and me. Not all this other bullshit that you throw around. Well, I guess I need a little help with that then. That's for sure huh? The bullshit? Yeah, that's for sure. You know, this is really, really hard for me. I mean, you're out, your here. What do you want me to do, CJ? Move to another town? You know when I grew out of being a little girl you just didn't want to deal with me anymore. It wasn't that I didn't want to deal with you, CJ. I didn't have a choice. I was in jail. I couldn't do the things for you I wanted to do. I mean, I missed you too. I love you very much. And I wanted to be with you. Dad, I am just really pissed at you. That's all I have to say, okay? Yeah well I'm a little... Excuse me, sir. Yeah? [bashing] Daddy?! Hey, wait a second, that's my, ah! [screaming] Ow! Dad! Shut up! Hey, let her go! Hey! [bashing] [tense music] [bashing] [revving] Let's go! -[tires screeching] -[energetic music] Look, look, there they are! That's them right there! Red light's coming right up our ass. [revving] I'm gonna lose these guys. [tires screeching] Hold on. [tires screeching] [siren blaring] [tires screeching] [siren blaring] [tires screeching] [bell dinging] [energetic music] Look, wait, there they are! [tires screeching] [crashing] 96 Lincoln, I've lost the vehicle. Clark and Gregory Way. [tense music] Oh shit, they're not there! Let's go back to the restaurant. Are you sure? Yeah we can call the police from there. [revving] This is crazy. I mean, what we did then was, this is now and it's, I mean you can't be serious. This doesn't make any sense. Makes no sense. I mean, you know, we can't do this. We'll never get away with it. What are you doing? Hey, come on. What are you doing? What are you doing? [booming] Come on, asshole. Come on. Hey! Jesus. -[people chattering] -[radio chatter] [revving] [man over radio] Unit 12, 1020 in progress at 122 Fifth Drive. Oh my God! What happened? Someone shot Max, the owner. Hey, they were here before. They left in a hell of a hurry. Let's go. You think I should tell the police? Let's go, now! Yeah, why don't you? -[tense music] -Excuse me, officer? Officer, those two in the car back there, right behind you, they were here earlier. [revving] [tires screeching] We got the old man. But not the girl. Yeah, well some punk got in the way, I don't know. And then the cops showed up. Yeah, but we lost them. Well I think it'd be better if we leaned on him, it'll go much quicker, believe me. Okay, hey. Hey baby, okay. Whatever you say. Why did you pull me away? We're probably suspects. What? Take my word for it. That cop that we lost? He's got the make of my car. Would you just take me home please? I don't think that's such a good idea. What do you mean? What I mean is those kidnappers wanted you too. So where should we go? [sighing] I know a safe place. [revving] [crickets chirping] What is it? What's going on, fellas? Damn. This reminds me of my old commune. This is your old commune, asshole. It is? It is? It is! Look, Cassandra's painting. Old green eyes, that's it! Do I know you? Did we trip together? Who hit me, what for? There's nothing. Ice, I found something. What are you looking for? Whoa. [laughing] Looks like a combination to a safe. Yeah, it does. Oh is it? I don't know. Don't bullshit me, doc. Where's the safe, where's the money? What money? Don't fuck with me! Look, I agree, that does look like a combination. But it's not, it's my numerological number. You see the first set is my name. The second set is my birthday and the rest- That's enough with the hippie voodoo crap! Let me work him over. No, cool it. I'm going to give the good doctor tonight and tomorrow night to refresh his memory. You see doc? I'm talking to you! Tomorrow night when the little hand is on the rhino and the big hand is on the pony, time's up. And Doc. [tense music] Don't waste your time trying to escape. 'Cause they'll waste you. God Charles, where are you? Oh, no thanks. Well, thank you. You know, you're dealing with people who play for keeps. Now I still think you ought to go to the police. Sugar Bear, we can't. They're probably after us. Besides, if the kidnappers think we called the police, they might kill my dad. Do you have any idea where they could have taken him? I just don't know. All right, listen. Whenever there's a kidnapping, there's a ransom, right? Right. Yeah, I don't have any money. CJ, you're Dave's daughter. Now the kidnappers probably think you know where the cash is. So what I suggest, you go back to your apartment tomorrow morning, wait for the kidnappers to contact you, and then take it from there. I think he's right, CJ. Okay. Goodnight, kids. Good night, Sugar Bear. Thank you. Oh God, Charles, I'm so glad you're there. I've been trying to call you all night. Listen, I don't even know how to tell you this. My father's been kidnapped and Max is dead. What? Have you called- I can't call the police. They might think I killed Max. What? And the kidnappers, I don't know, if they think I called them, I don't know what they might do to my father. Yes, yes, I understand. You know, I think we should get together tomorrow and submit a counter proposal. Charles, what are you talking about? I can't go into it right now. I'm in a meeting. Not alone? That's right. Well who's there with you? Well certainly, is someone I should think with enough authority. The police? Something like that, yeah. The FBI, that guy. What's his name? McClean, he's trying to trace me, right? Well, I believe you're right on that. Now, how can I get in touch with you tomorrow? Why don't you meet me at my apartment tomorrow morning at, 10 o'clock? Yeah, 10. At 10 o'clock. All right. Well, very good then. I'll look forward to seeing you tomorrow. Good night. The FBI. What do they have to do with this? I don't know. This guy McClean, I think they're after the money too. You know, he warned me that something like this may happen. God, I'm in deep shit. ["Lean on Me"] I think we're in deep shit.

Fine, Mr. Duran, how are you? Charles, this is my friend, Michael. Charles Durant. Michael. I appreciate what you did. Thank you. Heard a lot of nice things about you, Mr. Durant. Listen, I'm sorry I'm so late. But I just got your message. And then I went by your house and apparently I just missed you there too. It's okay. I heard that Max committed suicide. You heard what? Suicide? -Yes. -That's right. The FBI just confirmed the cause of Max Kimble's death. The angle of entry was consistent with a self-inflicted wound and his prints were all over the weapon. Well, what about my father? Well, any ransom demands? Calls from the alleged kidnappers? No. I'm sorry, Ms. Forrest, but we can't file a missing persons report until 48 hours have elapsed. Hey, we saw him get kidnapped. You may have seen what looked like a kidnapping. What, what are you talking about? Well, it could be this. A man gets out after 17 years in the stirrer. He's got a couple of million dollars stashed away someplace. He fakes his own kidnapping. The body is never recovered and he ends up in Mexico, tossing down margaritas. You are out of line. Hey, we don't have any real evidence to go on. Come on in. That is ridiculous! Thank you. Mr. Durant, you want to sign for her please? Of course. You're free to go, young lady. Hawkins. We still got to sign you off yet, sit down. I'll wait for you outside, okay, Michael? All right. Come on CJ, let's go. Yeah, okay. Wait a second, what about Michael? We have somebody waiting for us. Who? The FBI. McClean, maybe he knows something, what did he say? He'll tell us what he knows at Katanya's lounge. So let's get out of here. Yeah. Okay, just wait a second. I need to talk to Michael for a minute, okay? Okay. -Don't be too long. -I won't. Listen, thank you very much for your help. All right. All right, I'll see you in the car. Okay. That your bike, Mac? Hey, I'm legal there. -Yeah. -I'm serious, man. I got to go to take care of something. It's really important. Where? I just can't say right now. I'll call you when I get home, all right? Sure you'd be okay? Yeah, I'll be okay. Thank you. You've really been a lifesaver. Excuse me, who do I see about this? Somebody want to take my money in here or what? Probably all out having donuts or something. Oh, back from your coffee break, good. Where were you when my last three bikes got ripped off, huh? [light music] Shit.

[truck honking] [bike revving] [dispatcher] Attention, all units be on the lookout for a red dirt bike just stolen in front of Fish and 23. Last seen heading eastbound Grant. This is Lincoln 94. Your red dirt bike just spotted headed south on Maple, in pursuit. [officer] This is Lincoln 22. We got him west on Elm and we're joining in pursuit. [tires screeching] [bike revving] [siren blaring] [bike revving] [tires screeching] [bike revving] [tires screeching] [bike revving] All right, all right, ow! You are hurting me! I'm coming! All right, there we go. Open the door. Right, right. Get in there. [tires screeching] [suspenseful music] [bike revving] Let go of me! Ow! Oh shit. Dad? CJ. Daddy. Oh baby, I'm sorry. They got you too. It's okay. Are you all right? Yeah I'm fine. Charles! What'd I tell you, Dave? Didn't I tell you this was going to happen? Oh, Dave. You never listen to me. You all right? Yeah I'm fine. Jesus Christ. [bike revving] Michael. Michael, what's going on here? Do you have any idea how worried I've been? Mother, would you listen to me? Now something terrible has happened. Oh, you're telling me! The police were just here. I mean, what's this about a stolen motorcycle? And where's my car? Don't worry about your car, all right? Who's this? Michael, this is Mr. McClean from the FBI. Oh good, I'm glad you're here. Now will you please tell me what's going on? Out all night, your mom is real concerned, Mike. I'd like to ask you a few questions. What do you know about CJ Forrest? She and Mr. Durant were kidnapped. Kidnapped? By the same guys that grabbed Dave. Who's Dave? They probably want to use her to get to her father, make him tell them where the drug money is. Drug money? You know what, I'll bet you they're the same guys that killed Max! Max is dead? Oh my God. Wait, who the hell is Mac? Friend of that weirdo, Dr. Dave Forrest. He was on the news. Thanks for your cooperation. Hey, where are you going? I'll find your girl and her father. You just sit tight. Sit tight, are you kidding me? Mr. Hawkins, people's lives are at stake here. Let the professionals handle it, okay? Michael. Can we talk? After all I am your mother. Somehow, I'll get us out of this. Do you believe me? Yeah. Little hippie magic. -Hey come on, man! -Hey back off, scuzz bag! Fiery little bitch. I like 'em like that. Just leave her alone. Whoa! Finally got a rise under the old doctor. All right, now, knock it off. You little scumbag. Please. Please what? Please just leave her alone. Gee, I don't know, doc. Harlan here is real attracted to your daughter and I hate to frustrate him. Because he gets mean. Meaner than a stuck pig. Little trim from your daughter here might be the only way to keep him peaceful. Unless you put your mind to something you know about high finance. Look, I don't remember anything about any money. Doc, don't bullshit me. Look, I was alone. I don't remember anything. Doc, put two and two together. There was someone else, but- Who? I don't know, it was a little person. He was short. I just, I don't remember. Sure? Tiny. Don't fuck with me, Doc. I don't remember! You better start thinking, Doc. You better start thinking real hard. Your time is running out. Theirs too. Now, Michael, let's start with the drugs and work our way up to the kidnapping and murder. Now, honey, why didn't you tell me you had a drug problem? Mom, I'm not on drugs. You're confused. Listen to your mother, kid. Hey, keep eating, Howard. Oh, you were always such a good boy. I just don't understand. Listen kid, whatever you do, don't get mixed up with this Forrest character. Hey, what the hell do you know about him anyways? Plenty. I was a volunteer deputy back when we raided that hippie commune. Boy, that was something. All those grungy dope addicts, living like animals. We used to call it the free love arcade. Where was this commune? The old Williams barn up on route 17, why? I gotta go. Michael, you can't leave yet. The police still want to talk to you about that stolen motorcycle. Mom, I'll explain that later. Howard, I need your car. Oh, I don't think so. Hey, Mike. [car revving] [tires screeching] We know you were making it. We know you were selling it. Half the fucking state went cold turkey when you got bumped. So what's it going to be, Doc? There's no money. [whacking] Oh Jesus, Christ, leave him alone! He doesn't know where the money is. The fuck he doesn't. She's telling you the truth. You're wasting your time. Maybe you're right. Harlan, time to negotiate. All right, wait a minute, wait a minute! Hey. You want money, I got money. Oh yeah? How much? I can get your $250,000 cash tomorrow. Just stop this. Sorry, Davie. A quarter of a mill won't cut it. Hey. You know Doc, somehow I get the feeling we're not communicating. Maybe if I show you what I mean. [tense music] Don't, Dave! [CJ screaming] Don't even think about it. Get rid of that piece of shit. Down. Down! -[gun firing] -[CJ screaming] [suspenseful music] [tires screeching] Police were here looking for you today. What I should do is haul your ass downtown and have them book you. You wouldn't do that. Don't tempt me, Michael. Sugar Bear, the police won't listen to me. I know where they're keeping Dave and CJ. What, that old barn or commune or whatever they call it? That's a pure guess. No, it's a hunch, okay? Look, let's just go down there and check it out. We've got nothing to lose. We've got nothing to lose? We're not talking survival camp here, boy. We're talking real ammo, real blood and guts. Now I say let the authorities handle it. CJ? CJ? CJ. ♪ CJ riders streaking through the sky ♪ ♪ So fast the heavens can't hide her ♪ ♪ My my CJ right by ♪ [CJ sobbing] Oh baby. Remember I used to hold you in my arms? Just sing that to you until you drifted off? -Yeah. -God I love you so much. And I miss you. Daddy, we can't talk about this now. We're really in trouble. Now try to remember for me, okay? You said you weren't alone that night. You said there was somebody else with you. Somebody short. Who was it? CJ, we were tripping. I mean, it's always somebody with us, but somebody short and dark, I remember. Was it somebody who lived here? A friend of yours? I mean come on, Daddy. CJ, it was somebody short, dark, and hairy. -Oh jeez. -Real hairy. [sighing] Daddy, it was the sixties. Everybody was hairy. Not the Hare Krishnas. [CJ laughing] You're never gonna remember, are you? 17 years ago. I mean, we all had our stash places. You had to keep our stuff and everything. So that we- Wait, wait, wait, stop right there! I had my own stash, 'cause you're right, that nobody knew about. Daddy, is it there? I'll bet it is. It's right over there under my man Bob. Shh, don't point where. See the stove? Yeah. By the left rear leg, right next to it is a brick and it's there. I'll bet it's there. The money is there? Money? CJ, there's no money. I keep telling everybody there's no money. What the hell are you talking about, then? Forest Fire. My last batch. Oh, I bet it's there. Oh, CJ, I bet it is. Daddy, that's not gonna get us anywhere. Oh yeah. It'll get us out of here. I got a great idea. Come here. [tense music] Excuse me. Yeah? Can I get a cup of coffee? Sure. Hey! Do you ever lose it, that game? I mean, you seem to win all the time. Hey. [music intensifying]u I'll take some of that. My pleasure. [sighing] Sugar Bear. Who's the one that taught me to always trust my instincts? And who has been like a father to me for the last 18 years? And who's the one man, no matter what will always be by my side? Wait a minute. Now you can't wrap me around your little finger like you do your mom. Now you quit trying to sweet talk me, boy. Fine. Sorry. Can I borrow a weapon? No. Why are you being so hard? Trying to keep you from getting yourself killed. Goddammit, Sugar Bear! People's lives are at stake here and you're going to sit back and do nothing. Well, thanks a lot. For them too. [crickets chirping] [tires screeching] Hey! Where do you think you're going? We thought you could use some more coffee. Okay. [slurping] [lightly suspenseful music] Take him out. Agh! [groaning] Ugh! You sure this stuff is still good? I gave him almost the whole thing, it's not doing anything. Don't worry about it. When I made that stuff, I made it to last. Besides, the phosphopyridine LSD has a half-life of 200 years. He should be crawling the walls any minute now. I was a biochemist. Trust me. [lightly suspenseful music] I'll take him out. You take the guy on top. Yeah. And be careful. You too. [ticking] Hey Doc, come over here. You know Doc, in 10 minutes I'm a happy man. [grunting] I'm counting cash while I'm sliding into something juicy and sweet. [groaning] Hey come on, enough, all right! 10 minutes, Doc. It's your choice. [light suspenseful music] Cover me. -[bashing] -Oh! Come on. Cover me. You got it. [whistling] -[bashing] -Ugh! [groaning] Okay, come on. [grunting] [gun clacking] -[bashing] -Ugh! -Aw, shit! -[bashing] Ugh! [clattering] [gun clacking] -[bashing] -Ugh! -[groaning] -[bashing] -[bashing] -Ugh! Agh! -[bashing] -Ugh! Oh, oh! Charles! You're dead. Back up, Dave. Charles! What are you doing with a gun? You. You're behind this whole thing. Even Max. He didn't commit suicide, did he? You killed him. Oh no, I didn't. Max couldn't take the pressure. He never could. That's too bad, but at least more for me. More what Charles? There isn't any money. It's all about money, Dave. You know, back when you were one with the universe Max, Tripper and I, we were dealing your Fire. We set you up for the bust. We thought we knew where you hid the money. And now quite simply, Dave, [gun clacking] you're going to remember what you did with it or I'm going to kill you right now. [gun firing] [CJ screaming] Jesus, stop it! [tense music] [fire crackling] Jesus! Oh! Oh, baby. McClean? -Oh, god, Daddy! -Baby we can't. -Oh my god! -Now come on, I know the way out. -Daddy! -Come on, baby. [fire crackling] What's the matter, Doc? Can't take the heat? This place is on fire! Oh please, let us out of here! Now where's the money? The place is burning up! No shit, Doc. Look, we have to get out of here, all of us! Doc, where's the money? There isn't any money! Doc, you've got from here to there to find out or think about where's the money. What is there to think about? You stupid ass! Doc, you won't survive with your daughter barbecued, baby. -I'm gonna fry her! -You fry! Ugh! You pig, ah! [bashing] You again little boy? Come for me, beach boy. [bashing] [grunting] -[bashing] -Ugh! [bashing] Watch yourself. I got you, boy. Come on. [bashing] Dad, Dad. Here you are. No, there's fire there too. No, there's no way out of here, too much fire! You're not going anywhere. Look, give it up. If we don't get out of here now, we're all going down. Nobody is going down. We're all going up. [laughing] Hey, Michael. Michael, I know what's happening. Trust me. It's all right, hon, yeah. Tell me what's going on. Go with her, yeah. -Oh yeah. -[laughing] [fire crackling] -Jesus Christ! -Oh, Dave, ah! [laughing] [CJ screaming] We've gotta jump! -Now! -He says we can do it! [CJ screaming] Michael! Michael! Sugar Bear, back here! Are you all right? We made it! [tense music] [fire crackling] [gentle music] I don't drink normally. Dad, you don't do anything normally. That's right, CJ. Yeah, Dave, come on. It's a special occasion. You're right, Sugar Bear. And what's a few million brain cells, more or less? Allow me, Mrs. Hawkins. Thank you, Dr. Forrest. Please call me Dave. Dave, and it's Barbara. I'd rather stick with Dave. [Barbara laughing] Well Dave, try one of these. Sure. Yeah, I think I will too. Mmmm! Michael, Michael, your mother's a wonderful cook. What is this? It steak tartare. Is this raw meat? Mhmm. Do you like it? I'm beginning to love it. Barbara. This could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship. Oh, gee. [laughing] Can we eat now? Is that all right? Dinner's ready. Come on everybody. Come on. You know, it's really too bad about McClean. Yeah, well sometimes the good guys just don't luck out. Shame of it is, after all that, there wasn't any money. What I always say is, when all else fails, hug your Teddy. Oh, oh, oh. Whoah, whoah wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute! That's it, the night I was busted, I was with Tripper. Then I was alone. No, there was someone there, there was someone short, dark and hairy. No, short, dark and fuzzy. I was with, when I got busted, I was with Roscoe. Roscoe? My Roscoe? That's right. Who's Roscoe? My teddy bear. And when we got busted and Tripper gave me the money I gave it to Roscoe, haha! [upbeat music] Oh god. [laughing] All right, here we go. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, what's wrong? He's my Teddy bear. I had him since I was a baby. CJ, there's two million dollars in this Teddy bear. I know. All right, waste him. Oh my God. Look at all this money! We're rich! [laughing] Oh! We're rich, rich! We'll keep that down there. What are we doing? [light music] [tense music] McClean! McClean, I thought you were dead. [bashing] [crashing] Oh my God, ah! Oh god. McClean, what are you doing? Not McClean. It's Tripper. Don't you remember from the commune? Uncle Tripper? -[whacking] -Ah, oh! When the bureau sent me to the commune undercover I had the perfect setup. I made a bundle. I planted the money on Dave and I arranged the bust but the money disappeared. I've been waiting 17 years. I killed Max and Charles and now all that's left is me and the money. I know it's here. Where is the money? -Ah! -[whacking] -[bashing] -Ugh! [crashing] [bashing] [grunting] [crashing] Get off me, get off me! [bashing] -[bashing] -Ugh! -[bashing] -Agh! -[bashing] -Ugh! -[bashing] -Agh!
