[growl] [SINGING] And never more shall be. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God almighty,[inaudible] sinful man Thy glory may not see. I'm not going to smoke. I'm never going to drink. My old man's the preacher, and my pants are pink. Shut up. [singing] [banging] Boys. What is the meaning of this? He started it. He hit me first. And I'll hit you again. I'll knock your block off. Well, that's nice talk from a minister's son. Don't you call me that or I'll hit you too. Norman, that is enough. He said I was sissy. He said all preacher's kids were sissies. Did you have to prove him wrong in God's house? Anyone calls me a sissy, I'll fight him. I'll fight him anywhere And I don't like God. I don't even believe in him. Then leave his house. I'd talk to that young man in the woodshed. And I'd use a razor strop. Mr. Melton, ladies and gentlemen, please resume your seats. We will continue with the service. Robert, leave your sweater on. Now there has to be some other place to look. Anna, I am hungry. That isn't my fault. And I won't go near that kitchen until Norman is back in this house. He's out there all alone someplace, too frightened to come home. We looked all over, even in the mill pond. Clifford! All right Anna, all right. I will go and look for him myself. Leonard, come here. Give me that. I said no one eats in this house until Norman is back, and I mean it. But he's back. What? At least he's almost back. Saw him sneak in the church a couple of minutes ago. Now you wait here. I will take care of this. What are you going to do to him? That young man has spent all day with his conscience. And you know what a conscience he had. I don't think I'll have to do anything. It wasn't true God. I do love you. I did turn the other cheek once. Then he hit that one too. I don't want to criticize you or anything, but I don't think you should have picked me to be a minister's son. I mean, I'm liable to give your church a bad name. You know what you should have made me? A doctor's son. Then when I was bad, what could they do to my father? I mean, well, they couldn't fire him. Does it seem that bad to you Norman? Being a minister is one of the richest, freest callings in the world. Why? Well I'm not sure I can explain it to you. If the Lord ever calls you, you'll know. If the Lord ever calls me, I'm not going. I mean, God's not going to call on me to be a minister. He's going to make me a ball player, or a judge or something. But there's one thing I'm never going to be-- a minister. Norman, come here. [music playing] Norman hurry it up will you. We've got a real bead on this one. Blood and gore all over the floor and you without a spoon. Wait, wait, wait. Hey, are you a brother? Norman Peale, the general? Hey, he's a reporter. Take our picture. All right, watch the front of you. -Smile. -That was good. That's a good shot. Is the murderer still up there? Unless she killed a roomful of cops she is. [MOCKING] Unless she killed a roomful of cops she is. Do you want me to put her down. All right, now where were you standing when you're shot him? Over there where the marks are? Norman, when I take this shot, grab that picture. What? The picture, murderer and victim in happier times. I'm not going to take that. Oh no, not again. OK, boyscout, mommy will do it. Get a good story then. Good night all. See you later Ev. Can I get you something? A glass of water, a cigarette maybe? Why do you keep staring at me? This ain't no zoo. This ain't no zoo. [SHOUTING] I ain't an animal in the zoo. [music playing] Hey. Look, page one. Don't pay any attention to him Harry, he's suffering from remorse. Hey Charlie, how about a couple of drinks. -I'll get 'em Evelyn. -No you don't. It's my scoop. I'm buying. Hey Charlie. Improve your mind. It's a really nice piece you wrote for us. Thanks. Well all the papers had about the same facts-- names, ages, what happened, where. But ours was the only one where the whole scene came alive really. The crowd outside the house, the policeman, the reporters inside, the body on the floor, and the poor forlorn figure of the woman scorned. Nice reporting. I'd say that was as much of a scoop as Evelyn's honeymoon picture. Yeah. Oh yeah. Norman, what are you thinking? I'm thinking that I'm watching children playing in tall grass and a snake comes slithering through the grass and poises to strike at the children. And what do I do? Do I cry out a warning? Do I stamp the snake to death with my heel? No, I take out my notebook. And I describe how employees it poises there, how it strikes. You're a reporter, not a doctor. Your job is not to cure Norman. It's to find out and present. And you've got to remember that. But am I going to spend my life writing these miserable stories for people to lap up with their morning orange juice? What good does that do? I keep asking myself, what makes people so afraid? What makes them so cruel, so violent? Because they're bad. Thanks, honey. Look lover, you've got to learn that the world's aren't all full of boy scouts. There's lions, and tigers, and bears out there. But who's really good, and who is totally bad? There's a dividing line. It's called the law. [explosion] Norman, what was that? I don't know. It shook up the whole place. Well come on, you're a reporter aren't you? [loud banging] Let me in. I've got to get a telephone. Let me in. Hey mister, what is it, what happened? A building down the street, it blew up. [music playing] POLICE: Now stay back here people. Oh, it's coming down. Now stay back. WOMAN IN CROWD: My sister, she was in that building. Lady, you go to go. POLICE: Move those people back, get them out of here. -You too ma'am, stay back. -Where's and the Herald? [SHOUTING] Oh, come and get me, please! Somebody come and get me! Listen to me Mary. I can't get to you. This board won't support both of us. But you can get to me. Please, all you have to do is crawl on the board. Come on. [SHOUTING] I can't, I'd fall. Oh come and get me please. Oh please somebody come and get me. [shrieks] Oh come and get me. [sobbing] Mary, don't look down. Listen. Can you hear me? Help me, somebody help me. There's nobody over there that can help you Mary, but there's someone with you who can. [CRYING] There's nobody up here. Yes there is Mary. God's up there with you. He's holding out his hand. He wouldn't let you fall. I can't. I can't. I can't. Yes you can Mary. Now listen, to me, but to God. In quietness and confidence shall be your strength. God's waiting to help you Mary, but you've got to work with him. He put that board there for you. He meant for you to use it. [sobbing] Mary, believe me, God is there with you. He told you so himself. I am with you always. That means now Mary. OK Mary, that's it. Now crawl out on the board, the bridge God provided. It's good, and strong, and plenty wide. I can't. I can't. Think Mary, think. If that were on the ground, you could cross it with your eyes shut. Well close them now, you don't need them. Go Mary. [sobbing] [board creaking] [crash] Just say to yourself, with God's help, I can do it. With God's help, I am doing it. God and I are doing it. With God's help, I can do it. With God's help, I am doing it. God and I are doing it. It's inches now Mary. With God's help you're doing it. Mary, it's done. You and God have done it. [music playing] That was some truth. I'm not a preacher. Well you should be mister. You sure should be. [telephone ringing] Hello. Hello. Yes. Detroit? Oh yes, I'll accept the charges. Hello, is that you Norman. Dad, listen. What would you say if I told you that I was going-- [italian shouting] What would you say if I told you I was going to be a minster? Hold on a minute. No, no, never mind. You don't have to call me tomorrow. You can tell me in person. I'm going to come home. Right. Bye bye dad. What are you doing? Evelyn, in recognition of our short but sordid association, I will to you my shield and my sword. I had such high hopes for you and me. What? I thought of us as a team, not just on the paper here, but magazines, maybe even a book. Evelyn. Your soft heat is perfect for the sob sister stories. And with me to push you, we could go right to the top. But now you think you're John the Baptist or something just because a child finally does what anyone with any guts or common sense would have done in the first place. Maybe that's why I'm chosen, to remind people that they've got guts and common sense. Don't you give me that chosen stuff. If anyone's chosen, they choose themselves. Evelyn, I may be a nut, or a religious fanatic, or whatever you want to call me. But there's a little girl not far from here who's alive now instead of dead. There was a power that used me for that job. Now I don't care if you call that power luck, or soft heartedness, or pea soup. I call it God. Pea soup. Anna, Norman's coming home, but he won't get here any sooner if you stand there watching for him. A minister. Norman is going to be a minister. We'll see. We'll see. Now, let's get some sleep. Reverend Norman Vincent Peale. Dr. Norman Vincent Peale. Oh. Bishop Norman Vincent Peale. Ha. It's a pity he can never be pope. [music playing] Excuse me. Can you tell me where the seminary is? Right in here. They don't take you if you can't read. What? [laughter] Good luck Reverend. Not for three years yet. But thanks anyway. So it seems obvious that-- or logical that when Paul said to the Corinthians that-- the Romans. When Paul said to the Romans the wages of sin is death, that he must have been talking about a spiritual death. When a man lives against the will of God, he dies spiritually. At least that's the way I see it. Let us pray. Yes indeed, let us pray. Mr. Peale, If I want to watch a dance, I go to the theater. You have two feet. Stand on them. And for the level of heaven, in the most literal sense, look at me just once as if you believe what you're saying. It is obvious Mr, Peale that the elements of Greek are beyond your comprehension. Beyond my interest. It's the Bible that interests me. And believe me, that's Greek to a lot of people. And let thy grace, thy peace, thy love find within our hearts, not merely a resting place, but a springboard to the hearts of all mankind. Amen. I made it. Two years and I finally gave a sermon without falling flat on my face. We shall postpone the awarding of medals Mr. Peale. We still have one more year to go. No, I can't accept that image of an angry god up there throwing down thunderbolts. The God of Jesus is a god of love. He-- Mr. Peale, this is my class. You are here not to question. You are here to listen, to accept, and to answer. Is that clear? I didn't come here to be a scholar. I came here because, because-- Go on. I'm fascinated to hear just why you came. Because I heard a call to serve God. But I've got to find my own way to serve him. Norman, what can I say to you? I admire your boundless youthful vitality, and I put up with your doubts, your questions, and your groping for three years. I've put up with them because I believed you were sincerely reaching for something. But in these three years, I failed to discover what that elusive something is. I appreciate that sir. But if I'm going to be a minister, I've got to follow my own beliefs, not what somebody else says I should believe. Norman, our objective here at the seminary is very simple. We have to, if you'll excuse the expression of the layman, turn our a product-- in this case, a minister. Now just where am I going to send you? What kind of a church can I find for you? If you're ever in Berkeley, come here me preach. Well, now it don't seem likely that I'll ever get to California. Well not Berkeley, California, Berkeley, Rhode Island. But believe me, it's going to be just as sunny, just as warm, and just as beautiful as California. Good bye Lafe. Good bye, Reverend. [music playing] Hello. Do you ladies happen to be members of this church? We are. I'm your new minister. I'm Norman Peale. You're the first of my congregation I've had the pleasure of meeting. You weren't due 'til Saturday/ Well this is my first church. I couldn't wait. Now I'd like to get in. Is there a key someplace? Why don't you just try the handle? You see how excited I am? Oh excuse me, I forgot to ask you ladies your names. Mrs. Thompson. Mrs. Elwood Thompson. S.E Collingswood. Miss S.E. Collingswood. Mrs. Thompson, Miss Collingswood, thank you. Thank you very much. Well S.E., what do you think? Don't look smart enough to come in out of the rain. And pushy. I love these people. I love Miss Collingswood. I love Mrs. Thompson. I love this town. And I'm going to give them a sermon Sunday they'll never forget. Why am I so empty? Why can't I think of anything? Psst. Dad. Dad, boy am I glad to see you. What makes you think I'd miss your first sermon? Aw, that's just it. The Lord sent you as a rescuing angel. I have no sermon. What? Dad, give me some ideas will you? Just give me a few high points from one of your sermons? I will not. What I should give you is a good swift-- well what were you doing for three years at the seminary? The seminary doesn't prepare you for anything like this. What can I say to these people? I haven't lives long enough to tell them anything. God loves them, doesn't he? God looks out for them, doesn't he? Remind them of that. Yes. Tell them that. What else is there, hmm? First, let me tell you how happy I am to be here in my first pulpit and of how grateful I am. My text this morning is from Psalms 118:24. This is the day the Lord hath made. Think of that. This is the day the Lord hath made. And he made it for you, and for me. So let's rejoice and be glad in it. But every day is a good day, a day the Lord hath made. It just isn't in his nature to make anything that's bad. When the Lord created the world, he created the firmament, and he created the waters, and he created night and day. And when he was through his creation, he stepped back. And he looked at it and he said, this is good. We have to start every morning of our lives with a belief in the goodness of God, loving human beings, being glad we're alive, being thankful for the work we have to do. But how many of us really leave this way? I know I don't, not always. We say aw, I just don't have the ability. I just don't have the intelligence. You know, when you hear yourself saying something like that, you should stop yourself and you should say, this is an affront to the Almighty God. This is an insult to our creator, saying he made us badly. God doesn't make us wrong. We make ourselves wrong. When God made you, he made you right. And he didn't make you weak either. But if you hamper yourself, and you pamper yourself with all kinds of fears and timidities, ah, you're going to make yourself weak. I wonder, how many of you here know that old story of the two frogs that fell in the can of cream? Now they thrashed about in there. And they tried to leap out, afraid that they're drowned. But after a while they were pretty exhausted, and they had gotten nowhere. So one of the frogs, well he just sort of gave up. And he said, well what's the use of struggling. I'm never going to get out of this can of cream. If I'm going to die, I might as well die peacefully. So he folded his, whatever it is that frogs have, he folded these, and he slid down into the cream and he drowned. But, that other frog, he had a different training and a different background. He said I may not win this fight, I may even die. But if I do, I'm going to go down with all flags flying. I am going to die in the ancient and honorable tradition of frogs. Well he got his little legs going, and he got these things going, and he started pumping like pistons. And he pushed against that cream, and pushed, and pushed, and kicked and thrashed around, and never gave up. And pretty soon, tired as he was, he began to feel something firm beneath his little legs. And he gave ever much more effort. And he pushed and he pumped those little legs. And pretty soon he had solid ground beneath himself. And he gave a mighty spring, and he leaped out of that can, which had become by now not cream, but solid butter. Well that's just a fable I know, but it might be true. God gives even to the very least of his little creatures such an amazing resources of strength, of energy, of capability. This is my first day in my first church. This is indeed for me the day the Lord hath made. But there have been some days in my life that I'm not so jubilant in recalling, days that didn't begin with a feeling of gladness, a feeling of joy. As a matter of fact, on some of these days, I wondered why I bothered to get out of bed at all. But you know, unimpressive a candidate as I might have been, the Lord had his eye on me. And he called me to be a minister. And I could remember that day when God spoke to me. It's as clear as a bell, his voice ringing my years, when he said to me, Norman I have come so that you may have life and have it more abundantly. And I give it to you right now. So I stand here before you. I am new. I am both shy and I am brash. I am full of confidence, and I'm scared to death. Be patient. Pray for me. Oh Mr. Snyder, that's what I call preaching. Anybody asks me what I heard this morning, I could tell them. You did all right my us this time Mr. Snyder. He's able. Yes. Well, how do you feel now? Like it's going to be all right. And I love every one of these people. Not bad. Say, that was pretty spiffy. All right Anna. Now it's your turn. Go ahead, open it up. Look at the size of it. It must be terribly expensive. Norman never did know how to save his money. Come on mom, let's see. You've been holding that five minutes. Well it's my present, and then I can hold it as long as I want to. No. No sir, I'm going to send it back. That's what I'm going to do. What? I'm going to send it back and ask Norman to use it for train fare. Oh mother. Well you don't know how lonely it gets here with you boys at the university and Norman way off up there in Syracuse. All right Anna, I'll send him the train fare. All right. But you made me a promise, and I'm going to keep you to it. You understand? All right. Come on, open it up. I want to see what it is. It's a picture. That's Norman's new church. Brother, look at the size of it. I always knew he'd have a big church, but I never knew it would be so grand. Well it's-- that's a cathedral. Can't you just see him standing there and the pulpit in his long black robe. He doesn't wear robes Anna. Well if he doesn't, he should. I'll make him one, that's what I'll do. Silk-- silk. And black velvet down the middle, and big sleeves so when he throws out his arms-- well why not. Do you expect a main with a church like that to preach in his shirt sleeves? No sir. Norman's a man of position, and stature, and dignity. [buzzing] You come about the stove. No Mr. Duncan-- Duncan moved. I live here now. Now look buster, take it easy on that furniture of you don't get paid. I don't want to take up any of your time. But let me introduce myself. I'm Norman Peale. Whatever you're selling, I don't want. Seeing that you're new in this neighborhood, I thought maybe you'd like an invitation to come to church next Sunday. University Methodist? Unless of course you have a church of your own. Mister have you got the wrong man. My name's Feldman, Sam Feldman. Well then you're in luck. There's a beautiful synagogue not six blocks from here. I met the rabbi, he's a great guy. Go see him. We both work for the same boss you know. And my invitation still stands. You come and visit us anytime. Sure, why not. Shalom. Shalom. You sure do a job. Well thank you. But I got to, otherwise Floyd across the street gets all my business. You know, every time I see a man going about his work with a big smile on his face, I say to myself, now there's a man that believes. Don't you? Why not? I got good products. No, I don't mean that. I mean has faith in himself, the kind of faith that comes from going to church. You're kidding me? No. What, do you think I have time to go to church? You owe me $2.85. Supposing I talk Floyd into down closing down on Sunday mornings too. Then you both could go to church. I don't get it? You're what? Well who are you? Are you a preacher? Yep, University Methodist. Oh. This is the first time I've ever heard of a preacher trying to drum up his own business. Well he's just the man that should. He's the one with something to sell. Yeah. I'll be in again, make a fresh pitch. Good. Oh, your change. [horn] [bang] If your hurt, sue him. I'll be your witness. I'm suing him too. I'm charging him with fraud, criminal negligence, loss of my valuable time, and attempted murder. Hey, listen. You listen to me. I paid you to fix the brakes, the transmission, the clutch, and that, whatever you call that thing. And you did nothing. I didn't. Absolutely nothing. I could have killed that man. Oh wait a minute. When you see your doctor, send him the bill. Oh I'm not hurt. I don't know about my car. Well how do you know you're not hurt? Sometimes these things don't show up for 48 hours. I had an uncle who went around a whole week with a concussion, and he was never the same again. You haven't even got a scratch on your car. When can I get in touch with you in case I should develop a slight concussion? The Alpha Phi House, university campus. Just ask for a staffer. There's always someone there to take a message. There is? Yeah, up until 10:00 in the evening. Well, what are you going to do? Oh, you're leaving the car? You're darn right I'll leave it. And this time you're going to fix it. Oh yeah, I will. I'll take it apart inch by inch. Now how do I get home? You can get a trolley. May I drive you home Miss Stafford? Oh I wouldn't think of it. Really, I've already caused you enough trouble. If you should happen to be going my though-- That's exactly the way I'm going. Oh, I forgot your change. Thank you. Look, I may just drop in some time. You do that. I'll be looking for you. [music playing] I suspect you think I have a terrible temper. Yep. But I never like wishy-washy people. It's just that I paid that Robert two weeks allowance. I'm sorry, I really shouldn't call him that. He seems to be a friend of yours, Mr.-- Mr.? Norman Peale. Dr. Norman Peale. The Dr. is a new title. I kind of like the sound of it. Really. Syracuse isn't much like Rhode Island is it? How'd you know I was from Rhode Island? Your license plates. You passing through or just visiting? Oh, I think I'll stay for a while. Getting to like it here. I think you will once you get to know the people. There are lots of fun things to do. I was wondering about that. I think I need to change of pace about now. What would you recommend? Well, you can always take a drive in the country, have dinner at one of those quaint little restaurants? There's usually a name band at the hotel if you like to dance. You look as if you did. Well, I'm not much of a dancer. All good dancers say that. There's always a movie. Here we are. [brakes squealing] Of course, students can't date every night, but seniors are allowed Wednesdays and weekends. And it just so happens that this term I'm a senior. And this just happens to be Wednesday. That's right isn't it? Say, I tell you what. Why don't we take one of those nice little drives in the country, and we'll have dinner at one of those quaint little restaurants. Oh no Dr. Peale, no, I really would feel as if I sand bagged you. It would be very friendly to a stranger. All right, if you put it that way. Good. I'll pick you up at 5:30. OK. Oh no, wait a minute, better make it six o'clock. I have an appointment at the church. The church? University Methodist. I have to meet with my choir director for a few minutes. What kind of doctor are you? I'm the minister. Minister. Yes. It surprises me sometimes too. Six o'clock? Yeah, six o'clock. Please don't bother to get, I can manage. Goodbye Dr. Peale. It was very kind of you to drive me home. Bye bye. Six o'clock then? Dr. Peale, I-- I'm terribly sorry. I really am very stupid, but today is Wednesday, isn't it? I completely forgot I had a date for tonight. I guess so mad back at the service station that it just slipped my mind. Please forgive me. I've got to rush. Bye bye. I'll call you tomorrow then. Tomorrow's Thursday. Well, I have an exam coming up, and I do have a date Saturday and Sunday. Well I'll call you anyway. Those little restaurants will still be there next week, won't they? Bye bye Dr. Peale. Goodbye Ruth. [bell] Alpha Phi House. Just a moment, I'll see. Ruth, it's him again. I'm sorry Dr. Peale, Miss Stafford seems to be out. I surely will. You're welcome. He said to tell you he called. What's the matter with him anyway? Is he old, dull, a wolf, or just plain repulsive? Let's just say he's someone I could never be interested in. Gee, maybe one of us will be. You can always use a good doctor. He's not that kind of doctor. Should be. Well, what a pleasant surprise. Mr. Johnson. Doctor. Mr. Marcus, I expected to have to look all over town for you gentlemen, and here you are. Yes, well you see, I had-- Now where was that thing. --decided. Ah, here it is. Gentleman, what about this mortgage that's been hanging over our heads? Well, it's traditional for an old established church to carry a mortgage doctor. Yes, but after 20 years of only token payments, ours is getting a little long in the tooth, isn't it? Now I have an idea that just might get us this building free and clear, in just a little while. Some theatrical scheme, no doubt. In a way, yes. Yes, and that's just what I though. Now Sam, please. No, no, it's time a few of us spoke in some plain English. Dr. Peale, this church is not a circus, and you who are not a paid entertainer. Oh, we don't mind you evangelizing to win new members. But just plain vulgar advertising. On my way here today, I saw a series of signs, like those shaving advertisements. Here, lost your gal? In a lurch? Don't panic pal. Go to church. And a big arrow was pointed directly at this church. Now you can't build the house of the Lord on a foundation of the devil. I see. Sam, don't be so black and white. No, no, no, that's, that's good. Mr. Marcus, let's talk plain English. When our Lord walked this earth for his three years, he used the best means of communication then known to man. He set up on a mountainside and he talked. But since that time, God has given us other ways to reach men's hearts. Among these gifts is advertising. In other words, letting people know what you have and where they can get it. Now I'm not ready to turn this great gift over to the devil. I'm in competition for the hearts of the young people of this university town. I need all the energy, all the, all the originality, all the sense of humor that God has given me. That's the reason for those silly little signs. And that's also the reason for this little idea I have not. Come in Henry. Where do you want this Dr. Peale? Set it right down here-- down here. Thank you. You're welcome. And in case you're wondering what kind of a devilish vulgarity that may be, it's a ladder. Every Sunday it lies across the last four pews of the balcony of our church. Since nobody ever sits there, it's the best place to store it. Well tonight I asked Henry to bring it up here to me. Every time I look at this ladder, I want to say to myself, Peale, you better get up off your laurels and start advertising, or you're going to spend the rest of your life at Syracuse preaching to this ladder. [music playing] I do appreciate this Mrs. Miller. I'll return them as soon as I can. No hurry Dr. Peale. Any time we can give assistance. Thank you. Miss Stafford? Beg your pardon. I saw Miss Stafford. And like Apollo chasing Daphne. [laughter] I recognize you Dr. Peale. Though I'm not a church goer, curiosity impelled me to attend one of your services. I appreciated it that kind of primitive drive, but I didn't know that you practiced it so recklessly. [laughter] No, I tremble to think of Miss Stafford's fate were we not here to offer sanctuary. Now wait a minute Professor. Just because I'm a minister don't-- Really Mr. Peale, you've created enough diversion. Would you go quietly and permit the class to return to order? Not until I've apologized to Miss Stafford for embarrassing here. I'm all right Dr. Peale. Just go. I will. But first I'd like to tell the learned professor that he was quite right. I was pursuing Miss Stafford, and I intend to keep it up. That is a man's prerogative until he's satisfied himself the chase is futile. If men didn't pursue women, this world would be in a sorry mess. No one's ever been able to explain why one person falls for another person. But when that attraction becomes mutual, that's God's most potent chemistry, maybe his greatest. [whistles] Be strong. Be of good courage. Be not afraid, neither be dismayed, for the Lord thy God is with you, with or so ever you go. If you believe that, if you practice it, if you yield yourself to it, doesn't matter what kind of obstacles and difficulties you may face. Recently I came across a thrilling and remarkable story. Even the title is glorious-- "By Wheelchair to the Stars." Now you wouldn't think you could go to the stars in a wheelchair, would you? But this man did. At 17 years of age, he was totally crippled by rheumatic fever. The mere wearing of his clothes was torture to him. He'd cringe at the flapping of a window shade, so, so tender were his nerve ends. They told him, you're finished, washed up, useless forever, and at 17 years of age. His parents were poor, so we had to sit around the house all day long in a little crude wheelchair that his father had made for him. Useless at 17, 18, 19, day after empty day-- useless. And that word useless cut into him and hurt him more than his painful body did. He didn't want to be useless. He wanted to do something. He wanted to be somebody, amount to something. One day a friend of his said to him casually, you know, you could make greeting cards? Now that wouldn't thrill you, would it? But he said he'd try. And he set to work. And after six months, he made one card, and he sold it for a nickel. And just when he thought he was making a little progress with himself, he fell out of his wheelchair one morning. And he lay on the floor trying to get up. But he couldn't. And he squirmed there like a helpless little newborn animal. Finally he heard the mailman at the door, and he called out to. And the mailman came in and saw him there, and lifted him, and set him back in his chair again. And said, are you all right? But the boy just threw back his head and he laughed. The mailman looked at him and he said, Harry, I just don't know where you get the courage. And the boy answered him. Well, I don't have much. But what I do have I get from a book where it says, with God, nothing is impossible. The next year he earned $800 selling greeting cards by mail order. And he took all that money and he made a down payment on 12,000 Christmas cards. His mother said to him, son, what if you don't sell them? What then? But he said, mother, with God nothing is impossible. Well he didn't sell those 12,000 Christmas cards. He sold 19,000 Christmas cards. And today he's one of the greatest manufacturers of greeting cards in the entire world. Now don't think that this story impresses me solely because it's a story about material success. It is that, and it's good. But it's much more than just that. It's proof of what God can do, proof that when people say, you're useless, you're helpless, finished, through, that you can still find the greatest secret in life, which is that with God, nothing is impossible. Now Norman Vincent Peale, you listen. Listen to what you just said. And the next time you have a tendency to whine or be defeated by anything, remember that you can go to the stars in a wheelchair. And you out there, you with your little troubles, or maybe you've got big troubles. But you listen to this because this is a fact worked out in the laboratory of Christian experience. Be strong. Be of good courage. Be not afraid, neither be dismayed. Practice that. And why can you be sure of it? Because in the glorious last line, the Lord. Now remember this, the Lord thy God is with you, wither so ever you go. Yes, even in the darkest shadows. And with him by your side, you can have courage over all of life. Spread the word around the university. I like to see young faces out there. Hello Ruth. Good morning Dr. Peale. If you're not busy, I'd like to talk to you. I feel I should explain why I didn't answer your calls, why I told the girls to tell you I was out. I'm not going to listen to your explanation. Dr. Peale-- At least not here on the church steps. We've got a long over due date for a ride in the country. Would you risk a ride with the wrong kind of doctor? [music playing] You're going to tell me why you didn't answer my calls. There was no point to it. Could you be more specific? I just didn't want to become involved with a minister. Is that all? I was afraid that you were engaged or there was some serious drawback. But, why wouldn't you want to become interested in the minister? I don't mean me, I just mean ministers in general. Well for one thing, I am not the type of girl that a minister should waste his time on. I'd never do for him, he'd never do for me. Mm hmm. Why not? I like excitement. I don't want my life to be dull, not for a minute. What else? I like independence, like pretty clothes. Short skirts are going to be in style. Mine are going to be are short as anyone else. I'm just using short skirts as a figure of speech. Is that all? That's all. You want to go straight home, or would you like to stop for dinner some place? Well it's a long ride back. You're probably hungry. I've never been so hungry in my life. I hope I didn't offend you by what I said about ministers. You didn't say anything at all about ministers. You just told me what you wanted out of life. And I agree with you. I like excitement. And I certainly like my independence. Good night Dr. Peale, and thank you. Norman, please. Oh look, I meant what I said about ministers. I just can't see me-- I tried to tell you what I'm like. Charleston, Charleston. You see what I mean? Ruth, Wednesday night is still dating night, isn't it? I'll be here at 6 o'clock, OK? Alma, come on. All I can think of is that it's the last time we'll be decorating Alpha Phi for a dance. What are you wearing tonight Ruth? I'm not going. Not going? You haven't missed a formal since we came to school, not even the time you almost had pneumonia. I know. I never thought. A minister isn't allowed to dance, is he? What makes you think I'm going out with Dr. Peale? Well now who else would it be? He's the only one you've dated since Christmas. But to miss the formal-- Miss Stafford, have you been holding out on your own roommate? Are you engaged? Of course not. No, it's just that I can't-- well, it's the last chance I have to see him before graduation. Do you realize that I'll never see him again after next week? Well I can't very well leave here without saying goodbye, can I? Oh Alma, come on. Stop sitting there staring at me like that. [music playing] I thought it was a fine movie. I haven't cried so much in a long time. You know there's something about a spring dance, a soft night like this, and the music. Boys all shined up and the girls in those long party dresses. Come on. Where? I haven't heard a band like that in a long time. Do you know that this is our first date where you haven't had to rush home for a curfew? You've been given a gift of time, we might as well use it. What are you doing? Charleston. I know it's the Charleston. But you never said you could dance. Birdie's Gardens, Detroit, every Saturday night. That's wild. Oh, you're marvelous. I'm dead. I don't understand it. Doesn't it ever bother that you had to give up exciting things like dancing? Does it bother you? Well, I haven't given up dancing. You have since we've been going together. Oh, but it's not the same thing. I haven't given it up for good. I couldn't. How can you? Because dancing just isn't that important. I've got so much else instead. You want to know something stupid? All my life I've been saying, when I graduate, when I start teaching, when I'm finally out on my own. And all of a sudden here it is, and I don't believe it. In three days I'll be gone. I'll miss Syracuse, Alpha Phi, and you. You know, I used to laugh at people who, who would cry at weddings, and graduations, and things like that. I don't seem to be laughing anymore. Oh linger on sweet flower of youth. Thou art so beautiful. See what this night's done to me? I'm quoting poetry now. You picked the wrong time for it. No girl is that beautiful when she's crying. You are more beautiful tonight than you were yesterday, yet not as beautiful as tomorrow you will be. I don't even want to think about tomorrow. Scared? You shouldn't be. Tomorrows are made for people just like you, people that really know how to live every moment of their lives. And you do I saw that in your face the first time that your ran into me in your car. And I've seen it ever since. You just can't hide a thing like that. It's like that sunlight. Every time that we walk along the street and pass a child, you reach out to it. Every time we see something beautiful, you, you hold it up to me, as if God made it just for the two of us. You really look at life. You hear it. You-- you feel like. You're not afraid to laugh, and-- and you're not afraid to cry. What a lucky man I've been to share this world with you. I-- I think I ought to go in. I'm not very good at saying goodbye. Miss Stafford, may I have this dance? A minister's not supposed to dance. In public. But I'm alone now with my girl. Norman, I'm not your girl. I don't want to be a minister's girl. One dance then, not with a minister, but with me. Norman, I'd never make a ministers wife. I haven't asked you yet. Then ask me please. Ruth, I love you. Norman look. Someone sent me flowers. What do you know? Ruth, I don't understand it, the honeymoon's over, but I still feel love you madly, Norm. You phoned this in from the lake? Oh that woman at the florist talks. She's going to tell everyone she knows. Oh I love you. And I love this house. And I love the town because it loves you so much. What's the matter? Ruth, we are going to leave here. It was a hard decision to make because I love this place too, but I've accepted another pulpit. In a few months, we're going to New York. New York? The Marble Collegiate Church on Fifth Avenue. That's one of the oldest churches in the country. Yes, I know. I've been doing a lot of praying about it. I think it's what God wants. Means your work is finished. The debt is paid. The church is filled every Sunday. Ruth, you want to go? Yes I do. It's a challenge. Yes, it certainly is. You don't think I'll flop? Flop? What's all this confidence you're talking about? You're not a fraud are you? I certainly hope not. Am I so funny? No. I was just laughing at myself. Remember when I thought that life would be dull married to you? [music playing] You have everything you need? It's a long trip. You go get dad. I'll take care of John and Elizabeth. I can take care of myself mom. Me too. Now listen to me. For the next couple of days we can't bother daddy, you hear? What's the matter? What are we going to do? We're going to grandma's. We're going to visit grandpa. But it won't be like the other times. Grandma-- grandma won't be there this time. Danny, want get the door? OK. Come on. [music playing] I can't speak the words that I'd prepared to say today. They were gloomy words that sprang from my sorrow. And now my heart is too full of understanding. Our mother hasn't left us. In our hearts, we know that. We don't try to prove immortality because we want to believe it. We try to prove it because we can't help believing it. If a baby not yet born could think, he might say, oh, this is a warm place. I'm taken care of. I'm secure here. I like it. He'd look upon the process of birth as if were death because it would mean the end of the state that he was in. And he'd say, I don't want it to end. What to us is life is to him death. And he resists it. But soon the day comes when he does die to that world and is born into this life here. What happens to him? He's cradled in loving arms. Soft hands touch him and hold him gently. A kind face looks down on him, and he loves that face. Soon he begins to grow and love life. Oh he has some hardships and some struggles which toughen his fiber. But he learns to love God, and people love him. Finally he's an old man, and he's told you have to die. He protests, I don't want to die. I love this world. I like to feel the sun on my face. I love to hear the whisper of the rain. I don't want to die. But he does die. And he's born into the next world. Can we believe that all of a sudden the character of God and the nature of the universe will change so that he'll be born into a place of terror and gloom, or that he'll suffer complete extinction? No. That person awaken to find himself young again. Loving faces will greet him, and loving hands will reach out to him. More beautiful sunlight will fall on his face, and sweeter musical will sound in his ears. And he'll say to himself, why was I so afraid of this thing that we called death, when as I now know, it is really life. [laughter] And that time you bought her the diamond ring from the ten cent store? Remember dad? Your mother always wanted to believe the unbelievable. It never occurred her that I'd of had to rob a bank to get her a real ring that size. You know, there was a time when I used to think that laughter after a funeral was sacrilege. Well, it isn't. It means that someone, well like your mother, has given us a wonderful legacy, memories of good things. But there's one memory that none of you can share with me, and that's the memory of your mother when we were first married-- young and eager, filled with wonderful ambitions for the children she wanted to have. Oh, what's all this? Momma, you've got to do something about John. He won't go to sleep. You're having a party down here and I want to listen. John, over here on my knee, this one. I'll give you five minutes, and that's all. We are not having a party. We are having a serious discussion. That's all we do at home is talk. Dad knows more words than anybody. That's because he's a minister. And I'll tell you something young man, your grandmother always wanted you to be a minister too. Not me. That's something I've never going to be, a minister. Sometimes it's bad enough being a minister's son. [laughter] You little scallywag. Does that sound familiar? Yes, yes it does. Your mother was pleased when you went into the ministry Norman. But I don't think that was the plan she had for you. Now she always knew when Bob was born that he'd be a doctor, and that Leonard would be a minister like me. But you were a puzzle to her. I think she had more in mind for you, a writer. He is. Norman's written a book. Well all right here kiddies, now it's time to get to bed. Well now you see what she-- your mother always told me that she had a seventh sense about her children. Yes, yes, Norman is a writer of a book that nobody wants to publish? No one? What do you mean, no one? One publisher turned it down. Another one's reading it right now. Oh Ruth, he's reading my book because he's a member of my congregation. Norman, that is not the reason. Can I get in the family argument and ask what the book is all about? I bet it's a mystery. Oh no. The only mystery about this book is why I ever started it in the first place. You know, I can get up and I can talk my head off. But if I have to sit in front of a blank piece of paper with a pencil in my hand and try to put something down on it, oh, I'm scared to death. Come on, tell us what it's all about. What is it called? It's called "The Power of Positive Thinking." Oh brother, that's a mouthful. You can chew on that title. And I hope some publisher is going to find the rest of it equally worth the chewing. I read this very carefully. Believe me, I did, and I like what you said. But my company publishes religious books. Tom, this is a religious book. This shows people how to apply the power of God in their daily lives. Everything I've learned is in this book. Look, there a thousand men in New York City who can write, but there's not one who can preach a sermon the way you can. All right Tom, I get the idea. Thanks for your trouble. And I mustn't keep you people from dinner. I wish I could do something more. Oh, I understand. You know, Doctor, publishing is a business. Of course it is. Good night. Good night Tom. Good night Mrs. Peale. Good night. [music playing] Oh, it's perfectly ridiculous. You'll find a publisher, I know you will. No, he's right. I'm no writer. I'm a preacher. I've got work to do, important work. I can't waste any more time on this. Don't touch that. That's where it stays. Honey, I mean if. You are not to take this out of the wastebasket. That is a manuscript. Yes, it's a little hard to explain. I'm sure. Now why don't you go to one of the recognized agents? Last Thursday I heard Mr. Boardman speak, and I believe he said a publisher has the duty to bring out books that are for the public's good. He does. But there are channels we just have to follow. A man Mr. Boardman has a schedule. I know about schedules. My husband has one too. But I also know that there are odd moments in the day and that's all this will take, just one of those little odd moments. I can't. Rules are rules. I'll just have to wait until Mr. Boardman comes up. Very well, if you have nothing better to do, and you don't mind making yourself slightly ridiculous. I don't mind. Nothing else on the calendar is there Mrs. Grayle? No Mr. Boardman. Mr. Boardman, please. There is something else. It'll only take a moment. This is Mrs. Peale. I tried to persuade her not to wait. This is my husband's book. For reasons I'd rather not explain, it had to be delivered this way. Well didn't Miss Grayle tell you? Yes, yes she did Mr. Boardman. But please, just for once break the rules. Read this book. This is my telephone number. And you call me when you finished it. [music playing] May I help you? Yes. Please, do you have "The Power of Positive Thinking" by Norman Vincent Peale? Under both hands. Well in that case, I'd better take both of them before you run out. Cash or charge? That will be cash. Well on second though, I think I'll take a third one while they're still in stock. Don't bother to wrap them. Excuse me. Is it really that good? It's a wonderful book. A little spicy? Full of spice. But don't take my word for it. Why don't you find out for yourself? Let me make you a gift. Thank you so much. Here you are, two more bags. No, no, no, give them to her. No, no, no, I can't take them. Give them to her. Good morning Dr. Peale. Good morning. Here are your appointments for the rest of the day. Thank you. Six months after we published the first copy of "The Power of Positive Thinking," I felt that, well, maybe 15 or 20,000 copies would make a good sale. But now here we are. Not 15 or 20,000, but cop copies later, and still going strong. I wasn't using positive thinking. [laughter] All right, who has the first question? Rod Allenberry, "Akron Press." What do you call this approach of yours, a method, a philosophy, a system, or just what? It's just plain Christianity. What's in my book is exactly what I've been trying to say ever since I've preached my first sermon. Could you hold up the book when you talk Dr. Peale? Yes, course. This is a guide, a roadmap you might say. And there's nothing I've invented in here. It's all written right there in the Bible. It's stated again and again. Together God and you can do anything. I have a question on that topic Dr. Peale. The statement-- Identify yourself please. Mae Michaels, the "Eternal Fate" magazine. The statement you made that you and God can do anything, isn't that blasphemy? The God for whom the mighty King David bowed down in fear and trembling is not here to do what you want at the snap of your fingers. Well I certainly never-- You are a dangerous man Dr. Peale. You are preying on all the paganistic dreams of this world-- greed, power, money. Miss Michaels, you're completely out of line. God is my life. But he's an avenging God to those who would use him for their own selfish purposes. Miss Michaels. I want an answer. If you'll be quiet for a minute, I'll give you an answer. Why don't you sit down and give the man a chance to talk? Don't any of you see what he's doing? Yes. John Hellman of the "Christian Adherent." Though Miss Michaels expresses herself perhaps too emotionally Dr. Peale, there's great concern among the leaders of religious thought that you have reduced God to the status of a servant, there to do what you want when you want it. I don't say that at all. I merely state that man is not a helpless creature, born to frustration and failure. And that God had darn well better not let you fail. Mr. Hellman, we didn't intend for this to become a debate. Now if you have a question, please state it. Very well. Dr. Peale, is it the lamb of God you worship, or is it the golden calf of success? Mr. Hellman, you're out of order. Gentlemen please, gentlemen. Mr. Hellman please, Mr. Hellman. [chatter] What is this, some kind of a nightmare? Have I ever preached these things they're accusing me of? Have I ever said that you could use God to get what you want? I don't think I've ever preached anything but what's in the Bible. Norman, what you believe in is right. This criticism is vicious and unfair. You can't let it upset you. I know, I know. I've always warned people about not letting resentment cloud their thinking and now look at me I'm getting hurt and angry. Well then stop it. Norman, I love you too much to see this happening to you. It's eating away all your strength. Oh but Ruth, these people are not crazy fanatics. These are some of the most respected theologians in this country. They say I'm a menace to my congregation, to my church, to mankind at large. Why? I've got to find out why. How do you do Dr. Peale? You should know sir. Sit down. Tell me, why have you contacted me? Bishop Hardwick, you're a man I greatly respect and admire. And to put it simply, I'd like to know what you have against me. My first impulse is to make the conventional reply that I've nothing against you personally. But that wouldn't be true. It's impossible to separate you from your doctrine. Peale and positive thinking, you've become part of the current idiom. And you think that harmful? I've said so publicly. Did you expect me to recant because we're meeting face to face? You occupy the pulpit of the oldest continuous Protestant pastorhood in this country. With that pulpit, you inherited a great tradition, a sacred trust. I humbly agree. Humbly? Do you deny that you stand in that pulpit Sunday after Sunday and preach your own version of Christianity, a new religion? I certainly do deny that. Examine yourself Dr. Peale. Haven't you sought the spotlight? Haven't you enjoyed being the best known minister in America? Now I've said publicly that I deplore the easy kind of Christianity you've made so attractive. Now I say privately that I suspect you Dr. Peale. I suspect your motives. [music playing] Give me an answer Lord. I'm so tired of arguing, tired of fighting. Have I become proud? Do I need to have my spirit tempered? Only you know how to temper a man Lord. I'm not going to question your judgement. I saw him. I'm going to resign from my pulpit. I've got to do it. I have to get away from this church, away from everything if I'm going to think. And I have so much to think about. I'll write up my resignation tonight, and then I'll read it tomorrow in church. It's going to seem funny, without all those speeches to make, all those pressures, maybe I'll just get a little parish some place. And-- and we'll have time, time for the kids, and time to go fishing, time to really enjoy ourselves. Why don't you say something Ruth? Another Ruth said it for me. Whither thou goest, I will go. [telephone ringing] MRS GORDON: [ON PHONE] Dr. Peale. This is Norman Peale. MRS GORDON: This is Mrs. Arthur Gordon. My husband is Dr. Gordon of Mercy Hospital. I need you desperately-- 772 Central Park South. Mrs. Gordon-- when do you want to see me. MRS GORDON: Now, please? Well I guess if I needed your husband at 4:30 in the morning, he'd come. I'll start right away. Thank you for coming. I'm Arthur Gordon. My wife is upstairs with Mary Ann, our daughter. Mary Ann has been in a coma for four days. Tonight, some of the finest medical minds in the country confirmed what I already knew. She's going to die. But my wife refuses to accept that fact. How about you? Dr. Peale, I let her call you because I thought you might be able to help her, not because I believe you can help my girl. Dr. Peale. Mrs. Gordon. I had no right to call you. We've never been a religious family. I don't even know how to pray. Dr. Peale, in your book, you said there's healing in divine power. I've got to ask you, do you really believe that? Yes. I believe it. Then please, teach us to pray. [music playing] She loved the sun. Arthur. Look. Hello there. Thank-- thank you very much. Why are you thanking us? It's a long, long story. Dr. Peale, do you believe everything you wrote in that book? Yes. I've got to tell you, even after what happened, I can't. I don't. Oh, but I do Dr. Gordon. I do. There's one favor you could do for me doctor. Would you lend me your neck tie? I'm sure there's no one here today who is unaware of the controversy that has been raging in the newspapers, the magazines, and Church journals. The issue is whether my beliefs and my preaching are in harmony with the Gospels. Some of the finest minds in the clergy believe, and believe sincerely, that I am bringing reproach if not actual discredit upon my calling. If this is true, then I have but two alternatives. The first is to change my message and my methods. But this I cannot do, for the simple reason that I believe in them both. The second is to withdraw myself as an object of controversy, to resign not only from the pulpit of this church, but from the ministry. Seems strange after so many years of telling you what I believe and tried to follow in my own life that I should be called upon to defend these beliefs, as if I had invented them, when there is not one that doesn't come from the greatest teacher who ever lived, and who still lives. I believe that every individual is meant to be what God would deem a success. Now if this word success means the amassing of money or fame to some people, I am sorry. It does not mean that to me. And it certainly doesn't mean that to God. A successful person is nearly an integrated loving, creative individual, who lives in harmony with himself and his God. Now if There's. Anything wrong in being that, I have failed to find it. There are entirely too many people in the world today who are being defeated by the everyday problems of life. They struggle through with a dull feeling of resentment at the bad breaks they're getting. Well there may be such a thing as bad breaks, but there is a spirit and a method for overcoming these breaks. The spirit is God. The method, well, you can call it whatever you want. I call it positive thinking. Now by this, I don't mean that you just ignore all the hardships and all the tragedies of the world. Quite the contrary, you face every problem of daily life, but you seize control of it. You don't let it control you. Now is this idea contrary to the scriptures? I could name you dozens of passages from the Bible that would support what I've just said. But there is one now that comes to my mind more salient than all the others. It is from Philippians 4:13. Now listen to this, Because. This is one of them greatest statements ever made in the history of mankind. I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. Now if you will hold that idea in your mind and let it live within your heart, then you can have triumph over all your weaknesses, all your sins, and all your fears. But, the final analysis, it is in theology. It isn't religious theories, or schisms, or isms, or any of these things that really matter. What matters is people. God thinks people so important that he gives us authority over all other creatures. He is giving us authority over an ever expanding part of his universe. And he loved us so much that he gave his only begotten son to suffer degradation, insult, and death so that we may live as we are meant to live, not as a weakling, but as a person, a person with a giant in him. You are a child of God. Live that way. With true humility, yes, but with the dignity of your own importance, for that giant in you is the power of God. Shall I leave this church? For many days I have suffered and prayed over that question. But, this morning the answer was given to me. It was given to me in a way so glorious, so perfect that I can't tell it to you now without bursting with emotion. Perhaps later. But now I have my answer. For as long as God needs me, I'll remain in this wonderful calling. For as long as you want me, I'll remain in the pulpit of this great old church. [chatter] [music playing] I'm so proud of you. It's not going to be any picnic. Who wants life to be a picnic? I told you a long time ago I'm the kind of girl who wants excitement. You'll never know what it's like to have that small congregation. I know what it would be like. I won't have time to go fishing. You hate fishing. And I'll never have that extra time for you. I married a very special man. He's like the magic fountain. The more I share him with other, the more I have for myself. There's an office out there filled with people. Let them wait. You can't. Let them wait. I haven't seen my girl since last night. I never got to kiss you good night or good morning. Good morning darling. Good morning darling.
