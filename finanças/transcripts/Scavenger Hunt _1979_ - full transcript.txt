Look at all your little tadpoles, aren't they adorable? Watch it now, there's a little danger here, be careful. Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, you got warts. Oh no, you got gas. Swamp gas is the worst kind. Oh dear, oh dear, you're losing so many points. Oh dear, you're on the way to biology. Oh no! Oh, dear. Well, looks like I beat the inventor at his own game. Mr. Parker? Don't play games, Mr. Parker. Mr. Parker? Mr. Parker? Mr. Parker. Oh! Mr. Parker. There, there. Jump off. Sure. Oh Georgie, will you grow up? You know something? I think that girl's got potential. Mm, I don't know. Don't cry, love. Hey, give her a break. Can you imagine having to live with Georgie and Mildred? Yeah, you got a point. Yeah, yeah. I know, I know. Hi, Stuart selsome, attorney at law. You people serving any coffee or rolls? You people? I am sorry, no offense. Say, you must be the cook. You got any scrambled eggs and bacon, anything like that? I'm not a short order cook, I'm a master chef. Isn't there anything? Peanut butter and jelly? Anything? I am sorry, sir, but the kitchen is not within my domain. There is peanut butter. Stop! There, there, Mrs. carruthers. You're over doing it. I loved him like a brother. He was your brother. And a very, very dear one. I just wish we could get this over with. We can't start Mrs. carruthers until everyone is here. We can't start what until who gets here. Told you he didn't tell me anything. Jenkins. Jenkins. Yes madam. The servants have carried on so bravely. Admit it, would you admit it? C'mon. You took it out of my room. Morning Jenkins. It was mine in the first place! My standard one. - How are the children? - Everywhere. I found the sweater too. And the biggest brat too. Stop it. C'mon. Would you guys cut it out. Cut it out! You too! Bad news bears break parole. All right, kids. We're gonna behave for dear old dad huh? Just this once? Please, can't we get on with this now? Yes, we can Mrs. carruthers. I'm Charles Bernstein. Attorney for the late Milton Parker. You mean somebody else is late now? And now executor of his estate, an estate valued at $200 million. A few weeks ago, Milton Parker, probably realizing that he had passed go for the last time, recorded a message just for you to be played on the first Sunday following his death. The message becomes his last will and testament. All right you vultures, first the formal garbage. I, Milton Parker, being of sound mind and body. And I thought he was dead. Name as my heirs, my sister, Mildred carruthers, and her son Georgie. And her step daughter Lisa. My baby. My nephews, Jeffrey and Kenny Stevens. My late daughter's husband, Henry motley and their children. Yeah. My personal staff, Jackson, Henri, babette and Jenkins. And last and certainly least, Marvin dummitz who can't possibly know why he is here today. Hey, who's asking on me? Who cares? It's great just to be here, sorry, i missed that funeral. On the day of the big corporate showdown, my business partner had the misfortune of hailing a cab driven by that idiot, dummitz. My partner never made it to the meeting. From that day on, the business was mine. So that's the lineup. Now for the good stuff. My motto was play to win and so you scavengers, that's how my estate will be resolved by playing a game. A scavenger hunt, to be exact. Winner take all. Why you old bugger. The ultimate game. Please. Please. You will each get an identical list of clues. Each clue identifies an item to get except by purchase. Each item has a different point value. The inheritor of my estate will be the person. Or team that collects the most points by exactly 5 o'clock this afternoon. That's it. Why'd that worm. What's he trying to prove? Georgie and I are his legitimate heirs. Why should we have to play some dumb game just to get what's rightfully ours? Just a moment, Mrs. carruthers. I would like to wrap this up. No, you wait a moment, Bernstein. Why should this moron get a chance at my money? And the same goes for motley and his litter. And he was only related by marriage. And the servants aren't even related by marriage. I'm going to contest this will. That's the point, Mrs. carruthers, this will is a contest. Now, if you'll all follow me. Let's go kids. Come on, come on. Georgie, you're nasty. All right. I thought, you were represented me. Does everyone have to walk so fast? Eccentricity isn't illegal but it sure is a pain in the ass. Don't you talk that way to me. 200 million dollars. How do you like that $200 million? I can't believe that it's 200 million. I'll kill you. Mother. That, boom. This is war. Mother, would you like- we have been together for a long time. I see no reason to discontinue the association. Oh yes, I get the meaning, pie four ways is better than no pie at all. Then we are in agreement? Totally complete. Every which way if you like. Yes, yes, of course, pie is my most favorite dessert. Mother, mother, I have to talk to you. What is it? Does she have to come with us? Never been good at anything, especially money. Why should she get a share. I never liked her anyway. I think it would be better if you wait here, until we're finished with this mess. You know how easily you tire. But mother, it's Georgie that gets tired, not me. Why you! Save your breath. Attention, please. Attention! I want you to meet mr cornfield, the gentleman with the calculator in his hand, who will tabulate your point totals. To sum up, each of these lists is identical. It contains the clues, for 100 items. Each item has its own point value. The winner of the event, will be the team or the person who collects the most points. Acquire the items, anywhere you chose except by purchase. And store them in the areas, designated on your list. Remember, as long as an item is in your pen, its point belong to your team. Back at 5 o'clock, that's it? Give me that. Give me that. Get one.. Open it. Open it. Mr. dummitz. You'll need one of these. Mother! Mother, where are you going? Run, hurry up. Mother! Wait a minute. Mother! Nobody's leaving us behind. Wait, where is the best place to hunt scavengers? Press on, faster, faster. Bombs away! All right, gang. This is it, a real team effort. I do. - Let's go. - You're so immature. I know what that means. Time to shake, little brother. Well come on, let's go. Daddy, where are we running? Come on. You wanna come with us? No, that's all right, thank you, anyway. Really, you guys, you don't have to do this. Don't worry, 200 million three ways is not bad. Come on. What are you waiting for? A full share. You bloodsucking ambulance chaser. Mother, we don't have any choice, it's his car. Why don't you call a taxi, Mildred? Come on, come on, move it. Good luck! It's a deal! Screw you! What do you mean? Honk, honk, beep, beep, beep! Get out! Move it, or I'll move it for you! I'll kill you! You want me to move it? I'll move it! What's going on? Number one. To mention it, is not very dapper.

This is Lisa, and my little brother Kenny. Hi. Listen, I hate to be in such a hurry, but do you have a bullet-proof vest we can borrow? Oh sure. It's around somewhere. A splendid specimen. A real heavy weight. I beg your pardon sir, but we are involved in a scavenger hunt, - and we were wondering... - I know all about it. Black sneakers. Checkered shirt. Now let's talk ice cream. Oh boy. How do you ever find anything in here? Arvilla, are you sure you didn't take it to the cleaners? Alright, young man. If you can't choke your way out of trouble, try the poli-death grip. Ah, here it is. Like this. Foundit hit the dirt! Ah relax children. That's nothing but a paper weight, I keep the real things in the pantry. By the howitzer. Thanks for the vest, arvilla. I'll bring it back in a day or two. By the way, how did you and arvilla come to know each other? Aww, it's a long story, and we're in a hurry. Now wait a minute. It was a mugging victim. Jeff! You saved arvilla? How come you never told me? You're so modest. It's a long, long story. Come on we're in a hurry. The poor kid was getting pushed around, pretty rough. So, I pulled out my orthopedic brass knuckles. And I Pearl harbored the mothers... So modest. But, there were so many of them around. I had to resort to oriental self defense. You used karate? No. Acupuncture. Oh no I wouldn't. Maybe Jason, but not me. You think anyone who wears glasses is chicken. Oh yeah? Dad, the parachute came out! Hang on kids! Hold tight! Hold on. Whoa, that was just like a drag race. Boy has this turned out to be a fun Sunday. I think we have a flat tire dad. Dad, I think you gotta flat tire. I know Jason.

Swiftly, swiftly. - I'm sorry. - What's the emergency? What's the emergency? Jerry's missing. How's Betty taking it? I wouldn't call the police yet, not if I were you. Give him a chance to come home on his own. Not my son Gary. Jerry, the ostrich, is missing! Missing, are you sure? There should be five ostriches. And there's only four.

Alright gang, let's head back and unload some of this stuff. Right. Goody. I'll get to see the famous estate of Milton Parker. I grew up playing his games. It's beautiful. Or rather, I grew out playing his games. No, you're on a diet, remember? Wasn't it four hours? At least already, I'm starting to disappear. I'm wasting away to nothing. Lisa, Kay's disappearing. Where am I? Where am I? It's fucking punch drunk. I'll drink to that. Make mine diet coke. You clowns knock it off. I can't stop laughing. Need another dieter. What's so funny. I hear bells. - Stop!, I hear bells. I must be in love! Shoot! It's not funny. I know it's not the time and the place, but. Do you remember number 30? It's a policeman's uniform. Can I see your driver's license, please? You want to step outside, please? You know you were weaving all over the road. Yeah, I know, I'm sorry, it won't happen again. Why don't you come up here and put your hands on the front of this Van, buster. You guys want to come out there, please? Put your hands up in the front of the Van. I don't know what you guys are on, but I'm gonna find out. Don't you know how to change a tire, dad? I'm just tired, honey. Me too. I want to take a nap. Daddy could use a nap too, Jenny. Well, I don't care if I don't get a Princess phone anymore. That's all right, Michelle. L just thought we'd be an unbeatable team, that's all. But, we hardly have anything. Now this flat tire. Guess, we're finished. Come on Jenny. We'll be right back dad. They are gonna roast my ass for this. Have a nice day, officer. Hey dad, we really don't want to quit the scavenger hunt. Yeah dad we're with you. What have you got there? I found it in the field. That's a cow bell. This is a cowbell! Number 30, it chimes and rings, it sing ding-a-ling.

And the bananas! We have been robbed. We're going to be rich. I wonder where the servants got this thing. Don't touch that, you'll get germs. They'll fall off. Well, well, well. Can you beat that?

Never been on a scavenger hunt before! This is splendid! Beep beep! Beep beep! Merle I really appreciate this. This is just grand. I feel like the prize winning float at the rose parade. I haven't had this much fun in years. Hey listen, my name's merle, I'm with old Marv. He gets 50 points for me right? I think that's safe to say. Hey, merle! Merle. Merle, number three. Merle! Looks like dummitz is ahead by a few points.. Congratulations dummitz, if no one returns in 12 minutes, you're the winner. Here we are. Here we come. Hey, watch out for Florence. Make room for Florence. Come on, Florence, just a little bit more. That a girl, you can make it, just a little bit more. Yay dad, we made it. Hey- okay, kids, let's get her into our pen. Okay. Come on, come on Florence. Here we go, here we go. You've done surprisingly well Mr. motley. Team work Mr. Bernstein. Look at that maniac? Look at that? Dad look at all that stuff. First place! We won, we won! We made it, we made it, we made it. If you think you're keeping that stuff, you're crazy. Halt, in the name of the law. You're under arrest. No problem. What, if you're gonna arrest somebody, arrest them, they were- officer. Yeah ta da. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Stuart selsome, attorney at... Aah! Alright, you're under arrest. Oh drat! Did we make it on time? Perhaps you stop and ask questions later. I think I broke a nail. Put the cuffs on him officer, lock him up, take him away. All right, up against the car. Which half? But officer, you don't understand. These creeps ripped off our stuffl. Don't move. Right. Put the cuffs on 'em. Good heavens. Good heavens! Just a moment officer! My name is Charles Bernstein. Attorney of the late Milton Parker. If you could postpone your legal obligations until 5 pm, just ten minutes from now, i should be able to carry out mine. Yes arrest them! They killed mont Clair! Let me assure you officer, no one has been killed yet. So put your guns away gentlemen. As my brother in law chief Stanton would say, there's always time for justice. Mr Bernstein, would you please come over here? That's right Bernstein, get your butt over here. You're working for me now. See, see. There is a Jack hammer, there is a banana, and there is the hockey stick. They are the ones that stole our stuff. Wait, you mean they stole your stuff too? Too? You mean? Yeah, an entire Van full. How could you do this you witch? What you say may be true. However, once the items are in their sector, no one else can remove them. The points are theirs. That's not fair! Advance! Stop it! Stop it! The points are theirs. On no. Kindly put them back. But that's not fair. That's it. Come on. Put everything back. Come on, blondie. Let's go. You heard the English guy. Put them back. Let's go. The bananas. Come on. Let's go. Hey, give me that drum. He took my drum. Hey, we got one more banana honey bunch. Okay, Bernstein, we won! Declare us the winners! We won! This may be so. However, there is still nine minutes to go. All items must be totaled. You should be barbecued, pigs! 25 points for this! Yeah!? 25 points for this. No, no. Okay, let's go. Hey look at this. Oh my god, you dirtied your pants again. Ugh, lemon meringue. Hey, what the hell is going on in here? It's a scavenger hunt. Some rich guy is leaving his money to the winner. Yeah, so who are you? I'm short-sleeve, checkered shirt and black sneakers. That thing there - you oughta try some. Is a suit of armor. That's a total- okay guys over here. Is that for us? Hey, hey thata way boy.

Hi, where do you want me to take it? Now. Holy. Ask a little fish too. Shut up. I must say this is really a bit much. I can't believe this whole day. What's he up to now? More help for my friend! No waiting! Order in the court Bernstein! How about a little justice, man? Can't you see they're cheating us? Once again, I think mr.Salesom is covered himself. There is no rule against getting assistance. Assistance? You call getting a couple of hoods going out to rip off items assistance? Hm, hm, hm. Let me tell you your fortune. You don't get any fortune. You're all fired. Jerry, Jerry, Sally, Daphne, Florence! Sergio! Sergio, are you alright son? I was worried sick about you. You're making me crazy, you people don't know what you're doing. Oh Daphne! Daphne, it's daddy! What's the matter? She's a nervous wreck! What have you people been doing, you been torturing her. Who's in charge here? I must plead guilty, what's the problem? What's the problem? You have five stolen ostriches. Well, if you wait a moment, you can have your ostriches back and we'll clear up the whole thing. We used to hang horse thieves. Absolutely horrid. We did all work so well together. Yeah, we were really cooking til they ripped us off. It would've been between us or the Van for sure. Anybody but that witch. It sicks me. It sicks me too. Wait a minute. If assistance can be received... Can it also be given? What do you mean? What does he mean? I know what he means. Kenny, Jeff or Lisa. Right on. For me a yes. For me a yes. We must hurry, we only have a few minutes! Come along! A hundred million for me. A hundred million for them. A hundred million for nobody but me! A hundred million for me! Don't you touch that. It's worth 15 points. It's mine! You get a hundred, and I get a hundred. Please sir, faster into your section. Hurry everyone. Here's another tennis racket. It's all mine! Fancy. How's it going Mr. cornfield? Here are the current totals sir. Stevens brothers and Lisa, 925. Way to go! Carruthers, 1,480. Thank god. Not even close! Bernie? That's all we need, another cop. You're under arrest. What, again? Now what for? They stole my uniform. That's not true, Joey, as I remember it, you most graciously volunteered it, cutie. Oh god. At least I have my bear. Okay, let's go. What do you say? Come on, Jenny. Come on Jenny. Hey, you kids, you can get our vote too. We only got a couple of minutes. Uh oh. How much was a hockey stick, how many points? Oh, look at my list. This is ridiculous. Do something about it. Duplication, that's a rule. Duplication that means two items for one. Have you got it did you strike it out? You haven't struck it out yet. Duplication I call duplication. Listen let's help them win, okay? Marvin, where's your spirit? Beep,beep! Let's move it. Move it. Move it. Move it. All right, go on over. I'll grab my wonderful things. Duplication. I call duplication. I can count the Teddy bear. You sure? I'm not sure. Strike it out! No I never counted. Don't lie to me, cornfield. I didn't count it, sir. Way to go. Carruthers, 1,480, Stephen's brothers and Lisa, wait Mr. scorekeeper, wait! 15 points right here in this pen. That's right, now that's mine and what's mine is theirs if they want it. Let's bring it over! Let's form a bucket brigade. Dimwitted dummitz is in on the act. Well we still have enough points, don't we? Don't we? For the moment. Cornfield! Duplication! What are you doing? Duplication. Mr. selsome. I find it very difficult to believe that you and I are in the same profession. Kindly release Mr. cornfield. Who? Mr. cornfield. Mr cornfield when you completely succumb to. Would you care to join me in the shade? Way to go, come on. There's more. That's a double item. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Here Jennifer, take that. How much is it worth? 1,480. This is all that's left! How much? That's 50 points right there. There's a tube. How much is the tube worth? Wait a minute, wait a minute. Here he is. How much is it worth? Did you strike it out? Huh, did you strike it out? Did you? Did you? Uh oh, what are they cheering about? Come on, Jenny! Let's push him away. Love you guys- attention, please. Points have now been totaled. Carruthers, 1,480. Yeah, we know that. Steven brothers and Lisa 1.365. Marvin we just lost by 115 points. We won. We won. We won! Tell them to get the hell out of my property! No Mildred, be generous. Give them five minutes. But then... It's off. - It's off! We did it! I can't believe we did it! Marvin! Sam? Are you done Marvin? Wait. What's going on? Marvin! Tell me where I am man! Ace, I dunno. Somebody's backyard. What is that? That's Sam in my suit of armor. Yeah, but it's in our section. You stole him too? What difference does it make? The contest is over! Not quite, there's still 45 seconds to go. That armor's worth 60 points, now it's minus 60 for them, that's 120! We can still win. You can't steal anything out of our section fella. Marvin. Is there any rule against an item leaving this section on its own? No there isn't. Marvin! Tell him to get into our section. Steal my suit of armor huh? Now go this way. Which way? We're going this way. Nine! Eight! Seven! Six! Five! Four! Three! Two! One! We did it! You can get up now, madam. Mr. selsome has lost. It isn't fair, it isn't fair! Shut up you twit. You blew it! Everybody listen now. Kenny, Lisa and I, we've talked it over, we've decided that, that everyone with the exception of a certain threesome, everyone including the friends and help, will get a share of the money.
