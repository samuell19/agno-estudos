Welcome, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, wherever you are and welcome to yet another edition of the very best in live overnight talk radio. Good evening, everyone. Welcome to Shadow House. I'm your host, your MC, your congenial guide into the dark corners of human existence. Ridley Kay broadcasting from a secret location in the desolate hills of North Texas. This show is for fellow travelers, mind-expanders, truth seekers, and the morbidly curious. We got a great show for you. Tonight, we talk about ancient aliens! Yes, tonight over the phone is a tried and true UFO geek. Welcome! It's great to be back after a short absence. One in 50 children will experience a paranormal encounter. Many of them will suffer continued encounters for the rest of their lives. The UFO phenom and alien abductions have been with us continuously since the dawn of mankind. ...gray aliens everywhere in Samarian civilization. Strang skulls, dark skin, large eyes. Creepy. People, before we start, I want to get Arnold's take on all the current madness unfolding in real time. Its insane meltdown in the Middle East, the still missing Malaysia Airlines flight NH37. Ukraine and Russia, and the tragic downing of Malaysia 17. You'd think variably of course. That's easier said than done. I mean, there are so many variables that we should consider such as secret US air bases at Diego Garcia. ...interests. Putin and Russia standing firm. ...a lot of strange things surrounding Flight 17. I'd say Russia might be set up by the Western press which have been ramping up in secret bias reporting. - Divide and conquer, right? - Absolutely. The real masters are moving to push us aside to take over while most people become more and more dumb down by corporate-controlled news and entertainment if you could call it that. Circus like the Roman emperors did. Right. This is an age old conflict between the elite and the masses. Is the East and West being manipulated into an unavoidable World War III scenario? They sure are moving fast and coming to a head. Let's get onto the bigger picture here. "Shee-ple--" I mean, people. I've loved the paranormal since I was a little boy. If you're religiously challenged and or intellectually retarded, turn your radio dials now. Click your web browsers over to some cute puppies before we melt your brain, shatter your pre-conceived ideas about the universe and leave you crying in the corner like a little bitch. What if I have nightmares again? Good girls don't have nightmares, honey. So be a good girl. Crystal. You're awake. Every man fantasizes about picking up a beautiful girl off the road and giving her a ride. You don’t want this fantasy. Why? You a serial killer? Let me out. Can I drop you somewhere? Just stop the car! Miss, I found you passed out from heat exhaustion. ...took the UFO phenomenon seriously-- Name's Mal. Short for Malcom? Malvin. Bad-ass, huh? Check out the smile on that one! My name's Crystal. Feel's good, doesn't it? What? Moving on. I grew up an army brat. I traveled the world with my pa. He was based in Germany, Saudi Arabia, Philippines, you name it. Want to be a soldier, too? World helped me appreciate my beliefs. I believe if there was less ignorance in the world, people would just come together, set aside all the differences. I think it's all pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle. And our government still wants us to figure it out. I don't know anything about religion. My parents were something else. Yeah, well, far more things in this world that unite us than divide us. Why not? Welcome to my humble abode. I'm Ryan, how can I help ya'll? Uh, we'd like a couple of cheeseburgers and two rooms for the night. Ah, well, since you two look like lost lovers, I'll give you the special suite I only give to honeymooners! Sounds great. That'll have to do. Gentlemen. - Three. - Three. I'm out. Okay. Three knights. Shoot! This here is some both queens. Bet everything. Those are my three best cards. Three. Two. I'll take two. Hell, I'm all in. Yee-haw! Every dog has its day, ladies! Thank you. Thank you, gentlemen. How did you do that? Nine of spades. Ace of hearts Six of spades. Six of hearts. Six of diamonds. King of clubs. Jack of diamonds. Ten of spades. Queen of clubs. Seven of clubs. Nine of clubs, Four of spades. Crystal! You and your scrawny-ass girlfriend better get the hell out of here! Sit down. Rest. Crystal! Where's that sound coming from? Crystal, what's going on? Tell me so I can help. - Please, tell me-- - Get away from me! - I'm not being the bad guy! - Get away from me! Nice caravan. Don't get excited. It ain't mine. Boy, I hope you're not using my property for your hook ups. - Hey. - Hello. Hm. I'm Lyra Coslov. I'm a UFO researcher. I'm helping Ridley with his radio show. - Zane McAllister. - You old smoothy. - Good night. - Good night. - Rent. - Oh. Where's the rest? Business is shit in this economy. I got hustled by this young couple at the diner. I swear, this chick could read my cards before I dealt them. And then she pretended to be sick and they both took off with my money. That's the lamest excuse you've ever come up with. When are you going to get a move on? Get your sorry-ass RV off my property? Stop leeching my water and my power. Getting tired of taking my dead presidents every month, Zane? Yeah, well, it would be nice if I got all of them. Plus, when I agreed to rent to your dumb ass, I didn't know that you were the ring leader of "Blasphemy Radio". Live free or die, right? I don't like being on the government's radar. I'll leave soon enough. Well, you're on my radar and it sucks. If you don't pay all of your rent, from now on, it's going to take 600 a month after this so that it doesn't suck. Hypocrite. I thought you devout Christians hated money. Root of all evil and shit. Well, better Christian than your cockamamie mixture of, uh, conspiracy theory and new age crap. They'd ought to invent of word of what you believe in. Uh, "con-spiritualism" or something. Six hundred. That, uh, pretty foreign girl, is she another nut job like you? I know! She's perfect! Say hello, to, uh, master lucifer for me. No prob. Enjoy the brutal beat down you get from Saint Peter when you try to cross the pearly gates. So another episode of Shadow House. As you can see, I have a co-host now. Oh, fancy. Check out the looker on your left. Right, your right. After months of you guys pathetically begging, I invited best-selling UFO author and paranormal researcher Lyra Coslov to co-host the show for a week. She accepted my invitation. Go figure. Welcome to the show, Lyra. It shouldn't be too surprising. - You have a latch for knowing-- - Hold a sec. You're not accustomed to talking on the radio. I'm going to give you a sexy voice. A sexy voice? Wow! I've you under a version of photoshop, baby. I'm Ridley Kay. And I'm your father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate. What does that make us? Absolutely nothing. Dude, don't steal my thunder by talking before your introduction. - Sorry, Rid. - Long-time listeners will recognize the voice of our next guest. He holds two PhDs in electrical engineering in astro-physics. Plus, he's winner of the prestigious Ridley Kay Overall Cool Guy aware. An oldie, but a goodie. Please welcome White Path. Chief technology advisor but not a chief, huh? Always the bridesmaid but never the bride. You wanted to give us an update on our old friend HAARP in Alaska. What's going on exactly in the Arctic Circle? There's a secret arms race going on, folks, to control the atmosphere of the earth. In fact, if listeners click onto my website: they can observe HAARP activities in real time as we speak. Explain exactly what HAARP is in terms that a drunken teenager listening to us on Friday night at three a.m. can understand. Right. Well, HAARP, spelled H-A-A-R-P is not a musical instrument, kids. It's an acronym referring to a secret government facility in Alaska known as the high-frequency active auroral-- - Layman's terms, brother. - Okay, morons. Think of it as a one billion volt microwave oven aimed at the sky. That would make a lot of popcorn. ...generates low-frequency radio waves in the atmosphere that ripple all across the world. See, the US government uses this program to study the ionosphere of planet earth. However, it does have many troubling applications. In fact, HAARP is peaking right now. Many conspiracy theorists believe HAARP control the weather. And even punch holes into alternate dimension. HAARP will eventually play a part in clandestine mind control of large populations. In combination with chemtrail technology and particularly, if they manage to implant - RFID microchips. - And what do you believe? I mean, for what purpose? See, whenever HAARP activates, people around the world complain about strange events. Lights, altered mental states, sounds, voices, UFOs. Hell, someone out there might be having a real interesting night right now. We have a caller. That's my private line. I never give that number out. Alright, enough of your Native American Jedi mumbo jumbo. East to the Rockies, you're on the air. Please, I need your help! Sounds like we have ourselves a prankster. - Sayonara, lady. - Wait! Someone's following me! Oh, let me guess, you used a Ouija board once and now Satan lives in your closet. - Kid, I've heard it all. - Listen! You know, Rid? Those could be HAARP sounds. ♪ The monarch flies Across the sky ♪ Where did you hear that? And I'm going to bring it to you the truth! - Brought to your front door! - Alright, cupcake. It's way past your bed time. I got a bad feeling about this. Here's to another year of truth seeking. Oh! Not another step, young lady! You're trespassing on my property! That's the girl who stole my money! - Someone's following me. - Yeah, probably the sheriff! Yeah, he's looking for her and that kid! How are you going to pay for that there gate, young lady? Where's that stupid kid with my money? No way. Doesn't look like any kid I ever saw. Please help me. You want help? Go to the sheriff. Zane McAllister, put your dick away. What the hell is all this fuss? A woman can't sleep. Zane, can't you tell this poor girl's in trouble? Here. I'm Caroline. And "Mr. Trigger Happy" is Zane, my husband. You hungry? How's about I fix you a sandwich? Okay? My name's Crystal. Dipshit over there is the infamous Ridley Kay and his girlfriend Laura, or whatever. Pick up. Pick up! Yo, White Path. Come over here. Remember that crazy chick from the show? She's here at Zane's place. No, shit. I have no idea how she found me. And she wasn't kidding! Why'd you come here? She had a man in black trailing her. You know, those guys from the government who show up after UFO sightings and threaten everyone to shut up! Just get your ass over here! Turn it on? I'm listening to a show. No wonder you need help. Crystal. Meet White Path. White Path, Crystal. Look. If there really are forces following this girl, We should cover the considered things before getting involved. Life isn't a haunted house, Ridley. These scares aren't fake. And they don't stop just because we want them to. Okay. Her energy is dark, brother. I mean real dark! Don't you see this is our opportunity to prove-- Prove what? Everything! My grandfather says you only fight demons if you're an angel. ...more than once. Tornadoes. We call them tornadoes in American. If the tornado wants her, you and the holy roller over there going to stand in its way, gringo? Absolutely. I'll come by tomorrow. Lyra. I had a clear shot. Back to the Morning Star Hotel. It's very late. You could-- Sleep in your crappy rental home? Yeah, it doesn't sound so great when you speak the idea out loud. Well, I'll, uh, come back tomorrow. To check on Crystal. It's, um, it's nice having a young lady in the house again. Caroline, we're not going down that road. Not with that girl. Is she not coming out? Did you sleep at all? I don't belong here. I should leave. Enough moping around. Kid. You want to belong? Earn your keep. There's lots to do at the barn. Come on. Holy shit. This is what you guys saw last night. I'll see you guys later. Okay, here we go! Zane, would you care to say grace, please? Bless us our lord and these fine gifts we're going to receive to Jesus Christ our lord. And please damn Ridley to hell for eternity. Amen. Did I miss something? Okay, okay. So let me get this straight. - You're an atheist. - That's right. And you believe in the great spirit? Absolutely. We're Christians. And you? I believe in everything except creation. Aliens created us as some kind of an experiment. And you, Crystal? I don't know what I believe. So if aliens created us, who created them? We shouldn't be at each other's throats. No, I disagree. This is exactly what people with different beliefs should be doing. Having a nice dinner. - And great food helps. - Very true. - Yeah! - Thank you. Well done, Caroline. For once not for you. Thank you. Thanks. Crystal. Complete your task first. If you finish dinner early enough, Mom's going to read you Alice in Wonderland before bedtime. I'm tired of that story, Mommy. Can we read something else? You love Alice in Wonderland. My momma use to read that to me all the time. Bullshit, Ridley. President Clinton couldn't keep eleven private meetings with the interns. Do you know how many people would have to be involved in all those conspiracies? It's crazy! Ridley's right. It happens. Look at this. LA Times 1995. "President Clinton apologizes to the survivors and families" of those who were unknowing subjects of government-sponsored radiation experiments." How's that? I hate smartphone pads. And this one MKUltra. " The New York Times in 1974 exposes a secret US government program that ran through the 50s and 60s involving unknown US citizens in an attempt to create mind-controlled slaves using psychiatric drugs, sexual abuse and torture. The CIA ordered all project files destroyed but 20,000 documents survived when they were accidently stored among financial records that were recovered through the Freedom of Information Act." But why? Isn't the government made up of normal human beings? Why on earth would anyone want to do such horrible things to good, everyday people? Miss McAllister, that's where Ridley's show comes in. We believe some other force is at work. American ideas aren't the problem. Something seems to be interfering with American reality. Some outer force? Please. I'm sorry, and you know the truth? Know I don't, but in a world where extraterrestrials exist, - I-- - Are you sure about that? Yes. I was abducted when I was nine. Were you abducted? I didn't think so. Look, I researched the subject for over 15 years. Very impressive. Well, I've studied science for 17 years. And I hold two PhDs. I've had a book published. Bravo. Look, all I'm saying is, that in a world where UFOs are real, none of your creation stories make any sense whatsoever. We're not debating religion again. Thank you. That is just to keep you company, sweetie. We're not debating religion! Zane? Record that. It's just static. Just do it. You've reached the home of Caroline and Zane McAllister. Speak your piece. Have a blessed day. Crystal... Who is this? What do you want? Are you the man in black? Crystal... Stop following me! Crystal! Crystal! Crystal, stop! You'll be safer with us. If I stay, all of you will die! Not if we work together. You can't outrun the government. This thing will catch up with you one way or another. You really want to be alone when that happens? My entire life's a sequence of strange events. I never knew exactly how strange until my parents were murdered when I was nine years old. Living in an orphanage was more normal, My eyes were finally open that I was special. And not in a good way. Who killed them? Me? Possibly. The police never found the killer. Ridiculous! I mean, you were a child. That's what everyone keeps saying. You don't remember if you killed your parents? I'm afraid now and then I lose these blocks of time. It happened that night. Crystal. The only thing I remember from my childhood is seeing that man staring at me. Same thing happened yesterday also. And now, he's coming for me. Who? The man in black? Can you tell us who Malvin is? I left the orphanage and I caught a ride with a man named Malvin. And the lights followed me in the sky like they often do. And now, Malvin is dead. Are you suggesting you might have killed this Malvin? I don't remember what happened. I swear I'm telling the truth. I believe her. Especially after what I saw tonight. Oh, come on. We all saw it, didn't we? Promise me one thing, everyone. When the lights come, just run. Lyra. Yo, White Path. Get over here. This is a bad idea, Ridley. Man says he wants the container. Odds are, Crystal has it. Crystal didn't know what he was talking about. She has to have something. Whether she knows it or not. What's gotten into you? Our lives have been threatened. And she might have killed a guy. She might have killed her own parents. I don't believe that. Well, you believe what you want. I'll believe what I see. No one delivers on a Sunday. Careful, Zane. It's addressed to you. That belongs to Malvin. Sit down. Rest. Where's that sound coming from? Crystal, what's going on? You need to get away from me. Tell me so I can help. You need to get away. - Please tell me. - Get away from me! - I'm not the bad guy! - Get away from me! Caroline, step away from Crystal. - No! - I agree with your husband. What are you both nuts? You're going to believe that horrible man over this poor girl? She could be dangerous. Crystal, listen to me. You care about these folks, right? You and I need to go somewhere. He's a man in black flesh and blood. When people claim to be abducted by aliens, some of them say they were paralyzed. I was not abducted. I'm not lying. I have no clue what to believe. Maybe you're a listener of my show and decided to pull off an elaborate hoax, I don't know. He died here. They killed him and I couldn't stop it! Where is he? Why isn't he here? Ridley, these portraits were in my parents' house! I swear I'm not making any of this up! Why are they here? Okay. Okay. Why don't you go back to the truck? We're leaving. We'll have something to eat, alright? And then we'll sit down and try to reason this through. This mean anything to you? I'm having a hard time figuring out what paranormal bedroom invasions, men in black, UFOs, and British royal emblems have to do with an orphan girl from Texas. Did you hear my phone just now? No. Sir, you can't park your truck here all day long. Good thing I'm in a good mood. Next time, you'll be towed. Even with you two love birds still sitting inside. Sorry. Ryan! Have we been in this truck the entire time? You know the answer to that. Why don't you just rent a room instead of fulling around in the truck all day? You're going to get yourself arrested. Pervert. What the hell, Ridley? I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. Bring Crystal back to Zane's place. I'll meet you there. I think I'm being haunted by spirits or something. You just don't want to say it to the others out loud. You're a sharp girl, Crystal. I just want to record video and audio of you meditating by yourself. My equipment will detect the entire spectrum of the electro-magnetic radiation surrounding you. Just because human beings can't see invisible light, doesn't mean it isn't there. People get sunburned on the beach. Now, if your eyes can tune in to those frequencies, it'll be like seeing into a parallel dimension. The objects and creatures that share our space. They just cannot be touched. People say ignorance is bliss. Maybe they're right. Ignorance only works for people not being chased by sinister men in black cars. Do you ever feel like you're being followed or watched? But then you turn around and find yourself completely alone? Always. Maybe it's time we turn the tables. Now, listen. You're going to be alone in the dark for a while. But you will be safe. Alright? Promise? If anything comes after you in this world or the next, just repeat to yourself: I am with the great spirit. Inside here and here. What's with all the ghostbusters equipment? Well, we can't sit around playing defense. Eventually, whatever is chasing Crystal is going to get her. Unless we identify it and deal with it. Here's one clue. Funny, huh? I found a British royal code of arms hanging in the room where Crystal claimed that boy died. "Claimed?" What are you saying? They never found the body? The enemy's got to be flesh and blood. I mean, if they were ghosts, why would they cover the tracks? Why clean up evidence at the crime scene? They're human. I wouldn't be too sure about that. Have a look at this. It's from the static recording from last night. Notice the time in that video? Have a look at this. The HAARP facility in Alaska was active exactly the moment we received the phone call from a so-called Mr. Cruel. Now, I bet if we timed all the weird stuff happening to that girl, it would correspond exactly to the spikes on this graph. What about today? Crystal and I lost 10 hours of time this afternoon. We have no memory of what happened. We may have been abducted. You're suggesting that aliens abducted both of you in broad daylight at a diner? There it is. HAARP spikes today. At 1:11, 2:22, 4:44, and 11:11, just before I called you. All corresponding with the memory losses. Unbelievable. This huge conspiracy you guys have concocted is insane! The government would be hounding a poor orphan girl using a quarter billion dollar facility in Alaska? I mean, you guys are going off the deep end. I found this in Crystal's suitcase that may be the container that Cruel's been looking for. I think I know what's happening. She's being used as a gateway. It's an entity from a different dimension. First, you guys are talking alien abduction and now it's interdimensional beings? Could make sense. Aliens would have to travel faster than the speed of light to reach earth. By definition, it would make them interdimensional. They're spirits. Oh, of course! Spirits are operating a top secret government, uh, a government facility to torment a poor little orphan girl. What next? What next? Bodily possession? Perhaps we should get a Catholic priest in here. No, no, no. Better. We should burn some sage brush and waft the smoke around Crystal's head and get rid of all the negative energy. Surely that would stop the man in black. - Oh, would you shut up already? - He's got a point. Let's suppose that aliens are abducting people for real. - But why her? - Maybe she was bred for it. Part of a bloodline. No one is available to take your call. Please leave a message. Hi, Lyra. It's me. Really missed you today. Some really interesting developments here. Call me back. No! No! No! No! Please! What's wrong? Have you forgotten your childhood friend? This is Ridley Kay welcoming all our devoted listeners to another night of strange happenings and unexplainable phenomenon. I'm afraid my guest Coslov couldn't be here tonight. She's... she's busy. The funny thing about being a host of a paranormal radio show is the wide diversity of experiences people bring to the table. Think about what that truly means for a second. Last week, we discussed HAARP and secret-- ...involving the earth's atmosphere. Before that, we explored above top secret government programs. And then, it was demonic possessions and exorcisms. Secret bloodlines of the elite. And on, and on, and on. How can these various theories be true all at the same time? All my guests were people who're deeply convinced they experienced something real. We're all living in that ancient Hindu parable taught to us in school. We're all blind in trying to describe an elephant in the room by touching it. A blind man touches the tail and says the paranormal is like a rope. Another blind man touches the trunk and says the paranormal is like a tree branch. And then humanity fights over which version is correct. Is there anyone looking with eyes open? Is there anyone who can see the whole elephant? Please call me. Please. Crystal? Crystal, are you awake? I'm sorry. I didn't believe you. It's alright. It's alright. You're safe now. East of the Rockies. You're on Shadow House. Good evening. You sound familiar. This is the voice of the master, you young amateur. Welcome back. I can't describe the whole elephant, but I may be able to give you another tiny piece. Well, I suppose that's the best we can hope for. Actually, I saw an extremely interesting relic. This little idol? Absolutely. A young lady had it. She called the show last week begging for help. Yes, I remember her. What is this object? That is a statue of an ancient Samarian god Enki. Don't know anything about him. Oh, but you do. You and all your listeners do. - Really? - There's more to this ancient character than meets the eye, but ancient cultures have a long history involving strange abductions. It's a little hard to make out what you're saying. You find very similar stories about shape-shifting non-physical entities who abduct people from all over the world. Fairies in Scotland and Ireland, the strigoi in Romania, and Eastern Europe, the yokai in Japan, Rakshasa in India They even exist in Native American culture. Enki is one of the original names for the fallen angel that we call Lucifer. Are you implying that ancient aliens were perhaps spiritual in nature rather than extraterrestrial? Ask you friend White Path about that. Are you still there? Are you there? Typical. Can you hear me? You can't keep Crystal locked up forever. It's obvious this... this man in black, this Alister Cruel can track Crystal's movements. He must be using some kind of tracking device. An implant or a chip. You wanted to run. Get the bug out of her. Get her away from here with no one seeing. We give the girl some cash. She'll be free as a bird if we get her far enough away. And how exactly will we get an implant out of her? I worked as a nurse for 20 years. I can do that. No. I saw we make contact and we record it. Find a way to give them what they want without giving them her. Then we expose it to the public. That would protect Crystal. I get it! Finally, I get it! You don't care anything about this girl. She's just a way for you to find the truth with a capital T. It's your dream come true, ain't it? It's your once in a lifetime opportunity. I care more about Crystal than you know. Yeah? Well, she's a little young for you, don't you think? Guys? I like Zane's idea. Are you sure you want to go ahead with this? Okay, can you stretch your arms out for me? Look at the back of her neck, numbskull. Something's transmitting. I can feel a tiny lump. What would you know about that? Didn't you ever watch X-Files? Miss McAllister, you need to be very careful. It's extremely close to her spine. Okay. Okay, can you take her hair for me, please? There, too. Great. Okay. Okay. You sure you're ready? Okay, here we go. Okay. Can you feel that? It feels so weird. Here it is, honey. Got it! Oh, god! There we go. Good girl. Brave girl. 'Atta girl. I'll be praying real hard for you. Here. Take care of yourself. I wish I had parents like you. My little girl disappeared a few years ago. It was lovely to have a young lady in the house again. - Here. - Nah. Here. Don't take it if you're going to accidently shoot your balls off. We're going to figure this out. I promise. So Mexico. Crossover at El Paso to Matamoros. Exactly what I was thinking. They're activating HAARP again. Cut the lights, quick! Okay, take the next right. It's a short cut. Let's lose this guy and stay off the freeway. I told you. I'm not leaving your side. God almighty. Would you let me have my way just for once? This thing is bigger than all of us. Stay with your sister for a spell. I love you, that's why I got to stay. I love you, too, that's why you have to go. What the hell? Probably shit it out in a few days. Can I turn the head lights on again, please? I could drive a lot faster. Son of a-- Malvin! Shit! Shit! I hit someone! I saw him go under to the truck! There's blood on the front! Crystal, where are you going? Come back! Wait here and I'll bring her back. Come back here! Crystal? We should go back. Who are you? Alister Cruel? Crystal. Crystal? Crystal. This place is evil. We can't stay here. Come back with me. Mal? I'm here. Let me help you. Mal! Crystal? We need to leave now. You don't understand? He's trapped here because of me. I didn't mean to hurt anyone. I didn't mean to. I have to free him. Crystal, there's no one here. No! Crystal, stay away from him! That's not Malvin. It's a ritual site. Stop! No! What's wrong, Ridley? Did you forget all about me? Didn't I tell you? I'd be coming back for you. Ridley. You've been such a bad boy. Didn't I tell you never to talk about these things? But you just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you? You just had to go and broadcast it to the world. Who are you guys working for? And what the hell are you talking about? What do you want with that poor girl? Will your kind ever learn? Some things are simply beyond your understanding. Every child should know its limitations. But you keep on overstepping yours. So now, I'm going to have to punish you. Aren't I, Sam? What the hell are you talking about? Stay back! I don't want any trouble. This gun is loaded. ♪ The monarch flies Across the sky ♪ ♪ To meet the angel And his harp ♪ ♪ To sing the world A lullaby ♪ ♪ To stop the beating Of its heart ♪ Who the hell are you? You'd just shoot your own mom? How could you? After all I've done for you? Who the hell or what are you? Crystal? I want you to keep away from that girl. I'm going to give you what you need. Crystal's the container. Crystal, no! Good girl, Crystal. My darling! You did just fine! Now, finish him! Look, what do you guys want? Why are you doing this? Crystal, you don't have to do this. You're not a killer. Surely you noticed the butterflies. You knew what Crystal was right from the start. We told you. We always tell everyone the symbols are everywhere. It was you who took my daughter, too! You bastard! What did you do with my baby? You're breeding people so you can possess them. That explains the abductions. The blood lineages through the ages. Pulling the strings of the people inserted as leaders. If it's any consolation, Crystal wasn't the killer. We simply placed something inside her. Something we nurtured and grew. Where did you come from? What do you want from us? We've always been here. Since before your kind, we watched as you settled. Waited, wanted what we've always wanted from every one before. Just that you'd live your life as you would normally. Just do what seems natural and easy, the path is wide and welcoming. It is already beneath your feet. You just have to walk it. To enjoy it. You're a part of this anyway. Every human being, whether you know it or not. I am with the great spirit. I am with the great spirit. I am with the great spirit. I am with the great spirit.
