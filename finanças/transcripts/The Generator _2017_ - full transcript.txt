Can I talk to you for a minute? Are you hungry? You certainly are a curious young boy. What's your name? Leander. Leander. My name's Max. I run a centre for gifted youngsters. Helps you do something important in your life. But more importantly I can help you make a difference. Leave your mark on this world. I know what it's like, to be cold, hungry, not knowing what to do with yourself. I can help you find a purpose. Get you off the streets. Interested? There's something very important I need to ask you. The power of the world is in which hand? Come with me. Hey Jena. So I had an absolute nightmare coming over from the station this morning. How come? Oh this odd guy groped my leg, he ripped my fucking tight, look at my tights. A stranger? Yeah, but I mean I'm not gonna lie I was fucking turned on. But geez at least buy me a drink first. Yeah. So tell me how how was your date last night? How was my date? Hello, what can I get you? Okay, I want a cappuccino. I want half soya and half semi skimmed milk, I want no sugar, no sugar. But I want a shot of caramel syrup, sugar free. Sugar free, you got that? Yes. Then I want three pieces of chocolate dusted on top. If you bring me four over I swear to God I'm gonna throw that hot coffee in your fucking face. Could I have the same please? Of course. Thank you. So tell me, how was your date last night? My date, with who? Pat, Pat, Pat? Patrick, I remember Patrick. We just went out on a cinema date. Although we didn't really watch much of the film. Why? 'Cause he was fucking fingering me the whole time. I'm was so wet. It was like a fucking. It was like a fell in there. I might as well I have had an umbrella. Why was the roof open or something? It was just honestly. All over, I had to clean myself up like... three times it's lucky I had a couple wet wipes in my bag. That's fine, that's fine. ♪ Polarize ♪ Stop looking at me like that. What I'm not allowed to look at you? You're a pretty girl. Can I ask you something? It depends what it is. What are you doing here? Where? Here. That's a personal question. Well I mean, I basically got all my family here and my friends and, you know we're doing the right thing for humanity so. Natalia what are you still doing here? Don't know, I guess I... I guess I feel like if I leave then maybe I'm leaving a bit of my dad. What was he like? He was amazing, he was my idol. God he was so intelligent. I mean he used to work so much though so I used to barely be able to see him but, yeah no, I miss him. He would have loved you. I wish I could've met him. Yeah, me too. So enough about me what about you? Why? I mean do you not want to go out and be in the real world? The real world? The real world for me was nothing but a pain the ass really. I was beaten out of home, When I was pretty young, and after a couple years Max found me. And brought me here, been here ever since. So this place, is my home now. I've got my family here, I've got Max. Welcome to your new home. Sit down. Take off your shirt. Now this is a sensory prone, we'll just monitor you, don't be afraid. You'll never have to be alone again. Is the procedure going well? Yes, thanks to Haptics technology my technique is greatly improved, there are no signs of scars or any visible defects. There won't be any buildup of hapatocytes will there? No, we've been monitoring very closely and there are no abnormalities in his blood tests. And you did switch the two sheath for a three sheath? As you recommended. And now the free flow of information is much more efficient. Very good. How are you feeling? Fine. Don't worry any discomfort or itchiness will be resolved within two days of insertion. And we'll be monitoring your blood tests very, very closely. Any abnormalities will be dealt with and resolved. As I would expect. How's Jena doing by the way? She's fine. Thank you for your time. You've got shit on your face. Where? On your face, shit. Is it gone? Yeah. Anyways, honestly this date was fucking epic I must have cummed like 10 times. Did you have sex with him? Yeah, well yeah, I fucked him, yeah. Oh you did. Yeah in the car, like on the car, on the bonnet of the car, in the back of the car, with the seats down. Like any position in the car we fucked, twice. In each position. What was it like? You know it's like that feeling that you get when your body's like shaking and then you're like ♪ La ♪ Like when you're singing? And then you can't breathe. You can't breathe? Yeah, literally. That sounds horrible. Oh no, it's like the best feeling in the world. Come on you must masturbate. Anyway, so what are you doing tonight? Actually, I have a date. A date, shut up, you've got a date? Yeah. With who? Just a guy. A guy? Who, what guy? A guy I met at the train station. A guy you met at the train station? What are you wearing, are you wearing this? Yeah, my dad said it looked nice. No, stand up, stand up. You're wearing that? Yeah, I like the blue. Babe you need at least, the skirt needs to go at least that short. I mean look at my legs. But isn't that a bit too much? No, it's not too much. And yeah one more button down here. I don't know if my dad would approve of this. You know how experienced I am. I know what I'm talking about. Okay, I suppose so. I'm just going to go to the bathroom. Okay, whatever. What the fuck? How are you doing today? I'm very well, thank you. It's a nice day outside isn't it? Yes, yes it is. It makes a nice change after yesterday. I'm feeling really rather nervous. It's okay, it's understandable, it's the unknown isn't it? I promise you that there's no dangerous or harmful side effects. Okay? I'm glad to hear it. I'm actually quite excited. Yeah, yeah it will be fun. Welcome to the studio. This is where it all happens. Gosh it's all very different from anywhere I've ever been. Yeah it's probably different than how you imagined it. It's actually kind of similar because it's a bit like Sci-fi movies. So if you could just place your palms face down on this surface. On the middle? Yeah just pop them in the middle and spread your fingers. Like that? Yeah, that's perfect. And then you could just look into the screen for me as well. Oh, actually, at the screen, actually if you don't mind, do you mind if I just take your glasses off? No not all just mind my hair. Thank you. Perfect, thank you. Now I know you've done your research into this so you know all of this. But and just for regulation purposes we just need to run through it quickly. So the basic concept behind the technology is that it's Haptics. Augmented technology and virtual reality that allow you to basically experience human touch in whatever scenario of your choice. So you've got two options. The first one is that you're basically hosted by one of our subjects. Now our subjects are real humans, so you'll remain exactly the same in terms of mentally and physically, but you'll be able to feel the human touch that these subjects are experiencing, in whatever scenario of your choice. And you'll also have another option where you can be in the company of one of our subjects in whatever scenario of your choice. So which would you want to pick? Running. Running? Running, definitely running. Are you ready? Yep I'm ready. Okay, enjoy. Thank you. ♪ All I can do is let you swing ♪ Come on man, you're supposed to be the young, fit one on the team. Look at you, I remember the 13 year old runt who could take a station, and now you're giving me orders? Yeah. I can bench press and kill you anytime. Alright, next. How did the date with Natalia go? Yeah, it went good. Did you get a kiss? Yeah I got a kiss. Anything more? I got a second date. Oh not bad, not bad. Alright up you get. Working hard I see. Well some of us are. You ready for your session? Yeah the runner right? The runner yes. How far does she want? Yeah, you'll see you're in for a bit of a surprise. Great. Let's take this off. Look at you two getting closer on person over there. Shut up. Hey Nat? Yeah? Don't get pregnant now. Go away! Thank you by the way for last night. Yeah thanks it was fun. Yeah I actually really enjoyed myself. Yeah, I'm looking forward to the next one. Yeah me too. Alright you ready? Yeah I'm ready. Well enjoy.

Nervous. I'll take good care of you. I hope you will. When was the last time you ran? About eight years ago. What do you remember about it? I remember it was a beautiful summer's day. And I could feel the grass under my feet. And the air kissing my skin as I ran, ran, ran through it. Oh I can remember so well, so clearly. I'm gonna try and give you that. Oh please, yes please.

No, well the thing is no more than three sessions per day because it can really mess up your LFTs. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whoa, hey! Ully! Fuck. Ully, hey, hey, Ully. Get some help. Ully wake up, hey, wake up. Ully, come on wake up, Ully! This is another strange experience for me. Are you comfortable? Getting there. Tell me about your family. Well, there's just the three of us. My son, my granddaughter, and me. My daughter in-law died, what about you? What sort of family do you come from? Well my family's here. Here? Yeah. How big is your family? Seven or eight of us. There's seven now. What do you mean seven now? I recently lost one of my brothers. And you're sitting here having dinner with me? Yes. And I'm really enjoying it, thank you. Well thank you. But that's awful. Was it expected? No, but I just feel pretty responsible for it. How? Well he was under my care when it happened. How old was he? 26. What? Oh God. You don't need to tell me about loses... Because... ...my son's wife she died and I was actually quite fond of her, very fond of her. Anyway I have my granddaughter now and she reminds me of her mother. Tell me about your 20s. My 20s, crikey that's going back a little bit. I had a wonderful time in my 20s.

What do you think think? Max there's a high amount of transadmonition Think of it! Your name will go down synonymous with the likes of Marconi, Tesla, Edison, Grabiec. Max there's a high amount of transadmonition... You will go down in history, Affecting the Protein. As the man who eradicated diseases, got rid off phobias. Max this could be dangerous for these patients. They could have autoimmune diseases, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis. Wait a minute did you hear that? Hear what? What? What were you saying? I'm worried about diseases in the subjects, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus. Your results are flawed! We have built a fail safe into the microchips which protects all higher brain functions and prevents any tissue damage! Natalia's results came back positive, across the board. Now this is what I want you to do. I want you to go back to the board, reset your diagnostics, and then report back to me. Think of it, on the cover of New Scientist. Is that what you've always wanted? I think, therefore I am. Have you noticed anything strange going on here? No, what are you talking about? People talking. No one's talking Max. No, I hear them. I hear whisperings, mutterings in the corridors. Max, you're just being paranoid. Did you hear that? Max, you're just being paranoid. Let go of me! Your father came to me in a vision, in a dream, it's time to move to the next level. Stop, I have to. You know you have your father's eyes? He would've been proud of you today. Max I saw you putting a microchip into Axel's neck. It's a monitoring device, a new nano probe, releases the chemical compound, perfectly safe. But why didn't you run it by me? It was a gift for you, and only for you. You must understand, it was a surprise. A surprise? A surprise. But we run everything by each other? Did you hear that? They stole the idea from me. They're coming, he's coming. I want you to monitor from downstairs.

So I just went and spoke to Max and basically I don't think that you had anything to do with Ully's death. Of course I had to do with Ully's death. No it was nothing to do with his health or anything so, I basically saw Max putting in these microchips into Axel. And so then I did a bit of research into it and there's these new microchips where they release these like nano-bytes so that someone could literally have control over the other person's brain. So you're saying Max is controlling the boys. Well, I don't know but when I spoke to. It is possible? Well I don't know but then I asked Max about it and he was being all suspicious and weird about it and so then it just made me think. Motherfucker, let's go! Max? We know what's going on. Max. And the angel came down from heaven with the key to the bottomless pit and he said, behold look what I have created. Are you proud of what we've done here? Yes. Max, that's not relevant. We asked you a question. Do you remember the first time we met? Yes. Tell me. You said I could make a difference. And have you made a difference? Yes. Have you made a difference? Yes! Are you proud of that difference? Yes, but not like this. We need to know if the microchip is related to Ully's death? Do you know what the difference is between dying for nothing and dying for something? So the microchip was related to his death? You are my prodigal children, my prodigal children have returned. Sacrifices need to be made to move forward in life. Max you set me up! No! How could you let me take the blame for this? It was your incompetence that killed him. That's a lie Max, you know that. Do you know what your father said to me before he died? He told me that you are such a disappointment to him. Both of you disgust me. You're not willing to do what it takes to go forward, beyond reason, beyond the physical, into the realms of thought. You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. Let me show you the results of our new technology. So what is this? What are you doing? Max stop it, Max come on! Make them stop, make them stop! Axel turn around. Turn! What are you doing? What are you doing? Get off of me. What's wrong with you? We need to talk. About what? I need to know why you are helping Max. Helping Max with what? With the microchips. He told me I was gonna be helping people out, that I was gonna be doing good. Helping people out for good? Ully is dead. I didn't know that would happen. Well so you knew all along? Yes but I didn't think it would turn out like this. You're a fucking asshole. Thanks, I'm trying to solve it and you're cussing me out. Are you gonna help me or what? Yes. Great. And then I'll break your neck. Nice mate. Guys, just stop okay? We just need to work out what we're gonna do. All these problems started because of this. One tiny microchip. I just don't understand how this power could've changed him this much. This is insane, is he just gonna keep knocking us off one by one? Don't say that kind of thing, don't even joke. I'm not joking. Look, guys we just need to get him out of The Generator, that's all we need to do. Oh that's all we need to do. Nice and easy is it? Look, we just need to get him out of the control tower for five minutes. But that's impossible he never leaves that place, he's connected. What's his weakness, how do we draw him out of it?
