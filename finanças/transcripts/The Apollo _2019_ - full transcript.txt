RALPH LAUREN: I never thought I was in the fashion business. If someone said, "Are you a fashion designer?" No, I hate fashion. ANNA WINTOUR: Fashion has to be desirable, and Ralph sees that. RALPH: I think it's important people express who they are. ♪ (MUSIC PLAYS, CONCLUDES) ♪ - "Son, "I write to you in your 15th year. "I am writing you because this was the year "you saw Eric Garner choked to death for selling cigarettes, "because you know now "that Renisha McBride was shot for seeking help, "that John Crawford was shot "for browsing a department store. "You have seen men in uniform drive by and murder Tamir Rice, "a child whom they were oath-bound to protect. "You have seen men in the same uniforms "pummel Marlene Pinnock, someone's grandmother, "on the side of a road. "All of this is common to black people. "All of this is old for black people. "What I told you is what your grandparents tried to tell me, "that this is your country, that this is your world, "that this is your body, "and you must find some way to live within the all of it." - The Apollo is synonymous with what it means to be you as black people. It's synonymous with what it means to be at your highest level. It's synonymous with what it means to be the you that you would love to be. It's synonymous with what can you imagine yourself doing and doing it beyond your imagination. - When I think about the Apollo, I think about African-American contribution to culture, to music, to dance, to performance, just to history and a legacy and to know that the Apollo holds space for all of that. - They paved the way, but they also paid a lot. I don't know where any of us would be without all those performances on that stage. It's the beginning of all of it. - If the United States is the big circle, inside of that is New York. Inside of New York, of course, is New York City. Inside of New York City, of course, is Harlem. And inside of Harlem, is the Apollo Theater. - Hi, ladies! How you doing? Where--where you from? - We're from New Orleans. - My name is Billy Mitchell, right? I am the historian here at the Apollo Theater. I've been here off and on for 51 years. - Wow. - Wow. - I started running errands here when I was 15 years old. I'm 66 now, girl. - So you done saw some-- you done saw some people come through here. - Everybody. - Yeah. - What do you think about the Apollo Thea-- when you hear the name Apollo Theater, what do you automatically-- - Music, showtime. - "Live at the Apollo." Well, I know it was one of the original places where our entertainers could come and perform at. - You haven't been inside? - No! - You want to take a look inside? - Yes! - Come on. Let's look inside. Come on, come on, come on in, come here. Come on with you. Come on with me. Watch yourselves, guys. We're coming over there by you. They're rehearsing for the production called "Ella." - Go upstage. Go upstage, Go upstage. - We're just excited. - So am I! I love doing this more than you love seeing it, girl. You have no idea. This is what I do! Come on with me. - You can, uh, move the music stands first and uh, Joe will give us the cue to bring in the scrim. And we're also gonna listen to the opening sound cues. If we're good, we should move on to young Ella. - One, two. Hey, hey. One, two. - And let's get this other one up over here, under here. - Can I have young Ella to the stage, please? Stand by on stage for young Ella, everybody. - We used to go down to the Apollo on Amateur Night, and there were two sisters who were the dancingest sisters in the world called the Edwards Sisters. When I saw those ladies dance, I says, "No way I'm going out there and try to dance," 'cause they stopped the show. And when I got out there, somebody hollered out in the audience, "What is she gonna do?" - It's November 21, 1934, and it's Wednesday night. It's time for the world-famous Amateur Night at the Apollo. Okay, Ella, welcome to Amateur Night. You got your dancing shoes ready? - You don't wanna dance? Well, what are you gonna do? - The man said, "You're out here. Do something." And I remember my mother had a record of Miss Connee Boswell called "Judy," and I went out and I tried to sing "Judy" like Miss Connee Boswell. And they said, "Ooh, that girl can sing." And I won first prize. - ♪ If her voice can bring ♪ ♪ Every hope of spring ♪ ♪ That's Judy ♪ ♪ My Judy ♪ ♪ If her eyes say "yes" ♪ ♪ But you're wrong in your guess, that's Judy ♪ ♪ My Judy ♪ ♪ If you hear her call ♪ ♪ In her soft Southern drawl ♪ ♪ "Hi, stranger" ♪ ♪ That's danger ♪ - Ella Fitzgerald was part of that first year of Amateur Night. She ended up singing and forgot the words to the song and started to scat. And it turned out she was the best scatter to ever live. - There's a legend about a piece of wood called the Tree of Hope. Every performer who ever played the Apollo Theater touched that tree, so that when you go up as a rising young amateur hopeful and you touch that tree, the magic of all of that contact goes through your bones as it went into that tree. It's a cutout of a piece of wood that came out of a tree in front of the Lafayette Theatre, which my father operated with his partner, Leo Brecher, before they moved to 125th Street. Performers used to hang out on the island on 7th Avenue hoping that my father, Frank Schiffman, would come out and give them a job. - Frank Schiffman was one of the most vicious competitors ever in the theatrical scene. By 1935, they had eliminated all the other competition. They were the only game in town in Harlem for African-American theatrical entertainment. - I was raised on the streets at Lenox Avenue. 125th Street was my playground. When people talked about the Harlem of the Cotton Club and the Savoy, black folks couldn't go into these places. I was born in 1930. White folks were going to these places. People forget that Harlem was just a wayward station for former slaves to try to get out of just being lynched openly. Racism was right there in New York City. - You have to understand where America was in 1934. We were still a segregated country. Music and art provided an avenue out of the legacy of slavery. - When the Apollo opened its doors in 1934, it was one of the few nonsegregated theaters that provided opportunities to people of color, specifically African-Americans. - When I was a kid, I would go to the Apollo and see a big band. The Apollo was my palace. - In the '30s, jazz was the popular music of its moment. It was the music that teenagers wanted to hear, it was the music that adults courted to, and it was what record labels wanted to sell to the public. So just think about it: You walk into a theater, and you see a stage filled with well-dressed black men in matching suits, shining instruments, working together like a machine. It was a model of black achievement that people relished in and, in fact, desired in their own lives, and that was the power of that big band era. - In the Apollo's earlier heyday, it was the only place that black acts could come and perform and then launch themselves into a great career. - And much of that had to do with Mr. Schiffman procuring the services of one Ralph Cooper. - Hello. - Ralph was always really cool. Always wore suits around Harlem. Ralph always had that show-business air about him. - Ralph Cooper was this showbiz genius. He created the idea of Amateur Night. He was a talent scout that would bring people in... Like Billie Holiday. The reason that Billie Holiday made her debut at the Apollo was 'cause Ralph Cooper saw her in a little club and came and just touted her on to Frank Schiffman. - ♪ Southern trees ♪ ♪ Bear strange ♪ ♪ Fruit ♪ - "Strange Fruit" was not something that Frank Schiffman wanted to do. He was really terrified to have her sing that and begged her not to sing it. - ♪ Black bodies swinging ♪ ♪ In the Southern breeze ♪ ♪ Strange fruit hanging ♪ ♪ From the poplar trees ♪ - Billie Holiday, when she did "Strange Fruit," the label that she was on, they didn't want to put it on the label because a lot of their consumers were from the South, and they didn't want to offend them. - ♪ The bulging eyes ♪ ♪ And the twisted mouth ♪ - She came to the Apollo and she sung it at the Apollo because she knew that was a safe space. "The people that are here will connect with that." And that was innovative in its own way because that was protest music, and early protest music. - ♪ Then the sudden smell ♪ ♪ Of burning flesh ♪ ♪ Here is a fruit ♪ ♪ For the crows to pluck ♪ ♪ For the rain to gather ♪ ♪ For the wind to suck ♪ ♪ For the sun to rot ♪ ♪ For the tree ♪ ♪ To ♪ ♪ Drop ♪ - Frank Schiffman kept these copious notes on performances and how much money he made, and it was about control. It was about him controlling every element of what happened in that theater. - You know, they kept cards on us all. Oh, there were things like um... "Good voice; talks too much." You know? - I started at the Apollo when I was nine. ♪ Black bear ♪ ♪ Black bear ♪ ♪ Something in the bottom of the bottle ♪ ♪ Makes you grate 'em all down, down, down, down ♪ I tap-danced... I did impressions, and I sang. Little Leslie Uggams. They were showing movies still. Always a tap dancer... A comedian... - Did you all hear the one about the guy... that, uh... Did I say something funny? - And then you had the star. - ♪ When we were dancing ♪ ♪ And you're dangerously near me ♪ ♪ I get ideas ♪ ♪ I get ideas ♪ - And the first person I worked with was Louis Armstrong. He was just a sweetheart. And I just loved watching him. I had my little space on stage in the corner where I would watch every performance that he did. - ♪ Lovely idea ♪ ♪ That I'm falling in love ♪ ♪ With you ♪ - It was like a school. - ♪ Somewhere there's heaven ♪ ♪ It's where you are ♪ ♪ Somewhere there's music ♪ - Ella, she had an open door, and she was always saying to my mother and I, "Come on in, I want you to eat something." There was always tons of food in her dressing room. - ♪ Until you will, how still my heart ♪ ♪ How high the moon ♪ - Dinah Washington had a lot of influence on me 'cause I worked with her too. - ♪ Only ♪ ♪ A moment ago ♪ ♪ You sent this smile ♪ ♪ And whispered hello ♪ - I was kind of like her little girl, and she would say to me, "I want you always to be a lady." I said, "Okay." - ♪ I felt my hand melt into your hand ♪ - And she used to keep $100 bills so that when people would come backstage, didn't make it or somebody needed something, she'd have $100 bills. - ♪ My bumpley heart ♪ - She cared about everybody. - ♪ Was letting me know ♪ ♪ That this was no commonplace story ♪ - So I grew up watching these wonderful, wonderful people who were at the top of their craft. - Welcome to the Apollo Theater. My name is Billy Mitchell, but most people call me Mr. Apollo. So move over a little bit more. Some of you move down a little bit, move down a little bit. Excellent, watch, watch, don't trip over it. Come down a little more. So we are right now in front of the Wall of Legends. Now, these are photos of all the stars that performed at the Apollo over and over again to sold-out shows. Most of these great entertainers, their beginnings were here at the Apollo Theater. - I think the challenge that faces the Apollo and that faces black Harlem is, will it continue to be a kind of living, vibrant space of black cultural production, of black community making, of black expression? Or will it be more like a shrine to those things in the past? - Okay, so now to the real focus of the meeting. - What is the identity of Apollo? - What are we? Who are we gonna be known as to make people want to come? But what are we to people? - With the current political environment and things that directly affect the African-American community, I think it's important for us to be a place where we can talk about these issues. - The Apollo can be the place that creates new works that you can't see anywhere else, new works that are born out of, as they say, the African-American cultural experience. That's what we can be. - So we are here working and developing "Between the World and Me" by Ta-Nehisi Coates. We're just seeing actors for this first time interpreting the work of Ta-Nehisi. - We want to create the programming that you're gonna be talking about decades later. "Between the World and Me" is right on target. - "Son, "I write you in your 15th year. "I'm writing you because this was the year you saw Eric Garner choked to death for selling cigarettes." - So the book "Between the World and Me," it's letters to his son. How do I explain to my young black son how to grow up and become a man in the age of Trayvon Martin? He's reckoning with his own internal turmoil and tension, right? But let's try that. - "No one is held responsible. "All our phrasing, race relations, "racial chasm, racial justice, "racial profiling, white privilege, "even white supremacy "serves to obscure that racism is a visceral experience, "that it dislodges brains, blocks airways, rips muscle, "extracts organs, cracks bones, breaks teeth. "You must always remember that sociology, "the history, the economics, the graphs, the charts, "the regressions all land, with great violence, upon the body." - Hmm. - I wrote "Between the World and Me" because my friend Prince Jones was murdered in 2000, and both Kamilah and I went to school with him. We both knew him. - "He was dressed in his formal clothes "as though it were his senior prom "and frozen in the amber of his youth. "His face was lean and brown and beautiful, "and across that face, I saw that open, easy smile of Prince Carmen Jones." - In the 15 years since the murder of Prince Jones, so little had changed. This was an attempt to vent that, to speak to that anger, to speak to that rage, to speak to that--that pain. - "Our parents resorted to the lash "the way flagellants in the plague years resorted to the scourge." - Thank you, yeah. Great. That's helpful. That is helpful. - It's important that people who come from the same experience out of which the work was drawn get a chance to see it. The Apollo is probably rare among those environments and venues where that's possible. ♪ Let me take you to a place that's nice and quiet ♪ - Have a seat, sit down. Everybody sit down. I want to speak to you about booing. Those of you that are 16 and above... you can get booed tonight. Now, little history about booing. For 82 years, people have been coming to the Apollo Theater to boo the amateurs. - Amateur Night at the Apollo is our weekly variety show that's been going on since 1934. - We're always taught, you go to the theater... and that's how you were supposed to be, right? But--but culturally, that's not how--who we are. - First, you give them the power of the boo. And everybody's, at some time in their life, wants to boo someone, you know? - Boo! Get off, boom! Sing your best once you open your mouth, 'cause you don't have no second chance. - I went for the regular Wednesday Amateur Night. I just remember looking out and seeing, like, everybody booing, everybody. And that was the best thing that ever happened to me. After that, I was fearless. - ♪ I treated you ♪ ♪ Bad ♪ ♪ And wrong, my dear ♪ - If you performed on Amateur Night and you survived, even if you didn't win, that was an accomplishment. Like, Lauryn Hill didn't do well, but she learned a lot from that experience and she went on and obviously had, you know, a great career. - ♪ And I wonder ♪ ♪ Who's loving you ♪ - Hello everyone, welcome. Welcome to the world-famous Apollo Theater. We have orchestra seating straight ahead, the mezzanine seating here. Good evening, welcome. Welcome to the world-famous Apollo Theater.

Put their hand in your hand right now. Doesn't matter if you've never seen this person before in your life. Just take their hand, put their hand in your hand right now. Everybody should be holding someone--somebody's hand. I was a stagehand on Amateur Night, Ralph Cooper's show. - Hey, how about a nice big hand for my little band, huh? - And this lady who always jumps up and down and rubs on people and go crazy, her name is Eva Isaac. She had a permanent seat during Amateur Night. - They put me on the front row, like, this is the front row at Apollo and I'm in the center, 108. That my seat. Boy, I'll tell you, I would... Come close to that stage, I'll pull you, I'ma hug the heck to you. - I was singing to myself out loud, so she said, "Joe, I didn't know you could sing." - I said, "You gonna sing tonight." - Does anybody noticed how beautiful Eva looks tonight? - Second half comes up. I go out to change the mic. And as I'm changing the mic, Eva stands up and says, "Ralph, let Joe sing." - "Let Joe sing." Well, what Eva want, Eva get. - Ralph looks at me and hands me the mic and walks offstage. So I says, ♪ Don't you remember ♪ ♪ You told me you love me, baby ♪ - Joe come out there singing. I jumped and people started clapping. Joe starting singing and making records ever since then.

So when you have a point to say, "Oh, anyone can try it out" and the access is very clear, you just sign your name up and you can get a spot. You just better be good, and you just better be ready for it. - Sometimes we just see it week to week to week to week. We forget, man, this person came all the way from backhoe Georgia to get here and didn't really have money for the plane and then got there and then we sort of dismissed them, you know? "Well, you get one time through, oh, fine. It's gonna be all right." Well, not really. Okay, everybody. So we're gonna get started with our rehearsal and sound check. I keep reminding myself and reminding our band and reminding the crew how valuable this is to that person's moment in their life. Doesn't matter if they're gonna turn into Gladys Knight. In this moment, we have to think they are. So up first, we have Bianca Graham. "I Have Nothing," "One Night," and "How Sad." - I came on a Greyhound bus. And, uh, it broke down in Philadelphia on me.

It's almost taking it out of the hands of the owner. - In terms of who allowed for that to happen, who created that environment for artists to be able to be innovative, Amateur Night, you know, really came from Ralph Cooper. - Ralph Cooper, you are a legend. You are still alive and well, running the Apollo Theater, and giving young blacks an opportunity. Where did you get your ideas? - Well, the ideas were Harlem-born. Ideas were more or less Harlem. You know, the entertainment is like one big tree, and, uh, so many things come from that one tree. There's a lot of limbs that go out. And, of course, Tony, there was always two kinds of show business. There was a white show business, and there was a black show business. - ♪ C'est si bon ♪ ♪ De partir n'importe ou ♪ ♪ Bras dessus, bras dessous ♪ - My father was doing all of the booking of the theater. I kept looking at the programming, and I never saw some of the big giants of show business: Sidney Poitier, Eartha Kitt, Lena Horne. I said--I said to my father, "Why don't you try to book them?" And he said, "I'll give you the story that the agencies give me. "They're white acts. "They want to play the Persian Room, Waldorf Astoria downtown." I said, "I don't believe that." So I wrote Eartha Kitt a letter. And she called me up and invited me to come and have lunch with her. - Hello, Dan, it's me. The cruise is divine. I'm in very good hands. Yes, I got the car and the caviar. Before I left, she called the William Morris Agency, and she said, "I want to play the Apollo Theater." How sweet. It's just divine. - Now she goes out and marries a white guy, and the hate mail started from the black community. She was scared to death. But here comes the date. The theater was jammed to the walls. And I'm standing with Eartha in the wings and she said, "Bobby, they're here to kill me. You'll see." She walked out on the stage. People stood up and applauded for ten minutes, for ten minutes. And what they were saying to her was, "We know you don't have to come here to the Apollo. "We know you come here because you want to come here, and we love you for that." You know how important that makes me? I was taking care of buying toilet paper, and from that point on, I brought every act that we ever brought in to the Apollo, every show, every act, everything. - ♪ She's something Spanish, she certainly is ♪ ♪ How we say send her right back to Cádiz ♪ ♪ Because a moment that the lady came to town ♪ - It was in the late '50s, early '60s. I couldn't get any other acts to come in in the bad weather of New York winters, so I would put in the Jewel Box Revue. - The costumes, the antics, the skits, everything about it. I mean, you know, these are men dressing as women. It was just to be seen. - There was a group that reared its head and said, "That undermines the value of the black family." Glorification of homosexuality was a big thing in the black community, you know that. "If you do that show, we're gonna ruin your theater." I had a lot of money invested in that show. - How did you straighten it out? - I straightened it out for 150 bucks. Bought 'em off, and the show was productive for both me and the community. - When I was little, there was still a lot of prejudices going on in Harlem. They had a store called Blumstein's. African-American people weren't allowed to go in there. Being a little girl, well, "Why can't we go in there?" you know. There were a lot of stores that black people weren't allowed to go to on 125th Street. - "Black body is beautiful, "that black hair must be guarded, "black skin must be guarded, "our noses must be protected. "Both, we are all our beautiful bodies. - Oh, that is both. Okay. - And so feel free, again, finding those moments to connect, to talk to one another. - Sure, sure, sure. - "Now, black beauty was never celebrated in the movies, "in television, or in textbooks. "Everyone in any import, from Jesus "to George Washington, was white. "That's why your grandparents "banned Tarzan and Lone Ranger toys with white faces "from the house. "They were rebelling against the history "that spoke of black people only as sentimental firsts: "first black general, first black mayor, "a category of trivial pursuits. "Serious history was in the West, "and the West was white. Everything that was white mattered." - "Our history, weaponized. "They had their champion. Somewhere, we must have ours. "But then I'd read writers "central to the canon of our history. "From then, I knew that Mansa Musa of Mali was black "and Shabaka of Egypt was black "and Yaa Asantewaa was black, black, black, black, black, black." - Yes! - ♪ Got your high-heeled sneakers on ♪ ♪ And your slip-in mules ♪ ♪ Got your high-heeled sneakers on ♪ ♪ And your slip-in mules ♪ ♪ You're all right ♪ ♪ You know you're out of sight ♪ - When James Brown came to Harlem, it was-- everybody was there. - He loved the community. And we would have everything from kids who were cutting school to see James Brown to doctors and lawyers, people of all walks of life that represented Harlem. James Brown became synonymous with the Apollo after his first "Live at the Apollo" album. He knew that if he could capture the energy from the Apollo audience, it was gonna make for something very special, and he was absolutely right. - ♪ Hey, hey ♪ ♪ One time, I feel all right ♪ ♪ Uh! ♪ ♪ Let me hear! ♪ ♪ Two times ♪ ♪ Hey, hey, I feel all right ♪ ♪ Uh, uh ♪ - The album was hugely successful. I mean, it was on the charts for, like, 1 1/2 years.

Uh! ♪ ♪ Now you got it, put it on! ♪ - At that time, the minimum wage was a dollar an hour, so if I wanted to go to a dance or go to the Apollo, we had to sneak in. One of us would pay to get in, and then they would open the fire escape door. Then--then the rest of us would come in. This was regular. - The day that the welfare checks came out was a very good day to open up an expensive show because people had the money available, and we used to look at that welfare check and say, "Oh, that's the day I want to open this show." - The Apollo Theater proudly presents the Motortown Revue! - The first show I booked with Motown included Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, Diana Ross and the Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas, The Temptations, The Four Tops with Stevie Wonder. That was the show. - Right about here, ladies and gentlemen, like to introduce to you a very outstanding young man, a young man that's more or less considered being a genius of our time, and he happens to be only 12 years old. Let try to now make him feel happy, so meet and greet the 12-year-old genius himself, Little Stevie Wonder! - When the Motown Revue came to the Apollo, the party was on. - Everybody say, "Yeah!" all: Yeah! - Say, "Yeah!" all: Yeah! - Say, "Yeah!" all: Yeah! - Yeah! all: Yeah! - ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah, just a little bit of sou-ou-oul ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Clap your hands just a little bit louder ♪ ♪ Clap your hands just a little bit louder ♪ - That was done live at the Apollo, and that's how the world got to know about Little Stevie Wonder. - The fabulous Supremes!

When you first started there, your dressing room was up on eight. You had to work your way down. - Any artist that would come close to my room as they're going down the stairs to do their show, I said, "After you finish, can we play some cards?" And every time I played, I lost my money. - ♪ It must be love ♪ - When artists would come offstage, you wouldn't go and change. But if you did go and change your clothes, you would change them quickly and the Apollo had lots of steps, so you run back down and catch the next act, because if they did anything new, you wanted to check it out and see how well it was accepted by the audience. And if so, then you might go back and try to change it and put it into your act. - Everybody wanted to be better than the next group following them. Everybody was close. Competitive as hell, but close like a family. - You can't mention the Apollo without dance, that voices music. I'm talking all types of dance... Honi Coles, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Gregory Hines. Of course, Sandman Sims. I studied them. I was taught by all of them. From The Temptations to Gladys Knight and the Pips, Cholly Atkins was like a dancer who choreographed all of that stuff. Those four and five brothers who was stepping. - ♪ I've got sunshine ♪ ♪ On a cloudy day ♪ ♪ When it's cold outside ♪ ♪ I've got the month of May ♪ - That was a very deliberate move to have the feared black man in an Italian suit performing disciplined steps. - ♪ My girl ♪ - We had Dr. Kings.

We'd been sort of brought up on this sort of white music, which was a little bit square. Suddenly there was this really hip stuff, and it just connected. We just fell in love with it. We wanted to sing like them. We wanted to write like that and perform like that. - ♪ Well, shake it up, baby, now ♪ together: ♪ Shake it up, baby ♪ - ♪ Twist and shout ♪ together: ♪ Twist and shout ♪ - We then brought it into what we did, and we were introducing this music back to the white audience who didn't know about it, particularly in America. together: ♪ Work it on out ♪ - ♪ You know you look so good ♪ together: ♪ Look so good ♪ - So when we first came to New York, the Apollo was the first place we wanted to go, and instead we were warned off. "No, you can't go up there. "It's, like-- it's too dangerous, you know. It's too crazy. You can't go up there." And we didn't on that trip. You know, the early Beatle trip, we didn't go.

The relief, the joy to be home. - It was always our community welcoming home its great artists. - Hi! Welcome to the Apollo. It's a special evening. We want you to sit back, relax, and loan your souls to us for a few minutes. I promise you, we're gonna give 'em right back to you. All right? I also promise you, as you've heard before, before you leave here, you will have enjoyed this show as much any that you've had an occasion to see. All right? ♪ What you want ♪ ♪ Baby, I got it ♪ ♪ What you need ♪ ♪ You know I got it ♪ ♪ All I'm asking ♪ ♪ Is for a little respect when you get home ♪ ♪ Baby ♪ ♪ I need it, yes, I do ♪ Many years ago, oh, my God, the Apollo Theater was among the first three, four engagements of my career. I was about 17 years old. Back in that day, I did four shows a day. Sometimes we did five on the weekend. - We used to do here five shows a day. - 29 shows a week. - The first day we performed at the Apollo-- Don't tell that story. - No, you tell it. - We sound so dumb. - After we did the first show, I went upstairs to our dressing room, which we dressed at the last dressing room up top. And I packed my clothes, man. We were going out the door and Spain told us-- the doorman in the back-- - We said, "See, y'all!" - "Where do y'all think y'all going?" We'd done our show, and we were getting ready to go back to our hotel. They said, "You go back upstairs. You got four more shows." - To do! We said, "What?" - "Four shows?" - "Four more shows?" - We were in the theater from 11:00 that morning until maybe 12:00 at night. - The first time The Miracles and I ever played at the Apollo, we were just kids, man. I'm only 17. Mr. Schiffman called Barry and told him he wanted his money back. He wasn't even gonna pay us any money. We couldn't even get out of the hotel with the money he was paying us. - Mr. Schiffman, you didn't pay me enough! - ♪ Step to the right, now ♪ ♪ Do the Boomerang, girl ♪ - I can think back how poor my family was in 1932 and '33 and '34 and '35, '36, '37. '38, '39, '40, '41, '42, '43. We were poor, P-O-O-O-O-O-O-O- O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-R. - Comedians are always necessary because we're the ones who tell you the truth. - Figure this out for a case. Can you believe I have two cops in Chicago suing me for kicking them and biting them while they was trying to throw me in front of a train? - If somebody said to me tomorrow, "You're going to the Apollo," I'd tremble. Yeah, that was frightening, 'cause of-- and then the overwhelming reaction. Reaction. The laughs, this-- the theater shakes. - Richard Pryor, Redd Foxx, Moms Mabley, "Pigmeat" Markham: They were groundbreaking in the fact that they didn't try to be mainstream. They kept it, you know, for lack of a better word, real. - If you ever get arrested, you understand what they think of niggers. I mean, they just shoot niggers accidentally all the time. - I know, brother. - And you can't shoot a nigger accidentally that much. Every... "My gun just fell out and just, uh..." "Just went crazy, shot him six times." - What the fuck is up with the police? My God! I'm scared. I ain't getting rid of no guns. Fuck that shit! And I had a cop pull me over the other day. Scared me so bad, made me think I stole my own car! "Get out the car. You stole this car!" I'm like, "Damn, maybe I did!" "Oh, Lord, I done stole a car!" - You still a black man, you still got to deal with it, so we will continue to be making jokes out of struggle. - I think we've always had moments like that. When you're at that point of innocence in your life and when things are normalized in your world, how do you register fear? - I mean, as a black man, you're born into this world with PTSD. Yeah. - I mean, the first time a cop put a gun in my face, I was nine years old. - Mm. - Mm. - And I wasn't, like, Shaquille O'Neal size. I was an average nine-year-old, but that was PTSD. You know, any time they kick down the door to arrest my uncle, that's-- you know, that's PTSD, man. You know what I'm saying? So we're born into this world at a disadvantage, of course. - We're haunted... - Mm-hmm. - By these experiences, and we tend to be isolated in them. As a community, we have always lived out of spite. - Mm. - You know, in spite of the circumstances, we found the joy or the humor or the--the freedom of truth. - "Think of your mother, who had no father, "and your grandmother, who was abandoned by her father, "and your grandfather, who was left behind by his father, "and think of how Prince's daughter "was now drafted into those solemn ranks, "deprived of her birthright, "that vessel which was her father "which brimmed with 25 years of love. "I held you, "and a great fear, "wide as all our American generations, took me." I think our destination is, like, pure explosion, and then the next piece is literally the fog, and we're just trying to see our way through it. If we're flashing back and forth in time, so it's like Eric Garner, Tray--and like, it's those newsreel and headlines, and it's just bam, bam, bam, bam. It should feel like broken glass. - The man believes that he can kill him. He's a lieutenant. What it mean? I mean, even if the boy was in the wrong, he's not supposed to shoot him. - He has an outstanding record. He has received 20 citations in this department. I would say I didn't think the lieutenant, under the circumstances, had any other alternative. - That kid, that kid James Powell who was shot down in cold blood the other day-- and it was murder-- was my son and your son and the son of every black mother and father in this country. We must demand-- demand, my brothers, that this lieutenant, Gilligan, be promptly suspended and arrested for murder! And this should be done immediately! - In 1964, when the riots started, we made up signs. And the one black store that was near us, where, you know, you go down the little steps to go down into his store, you know. And we had told him, "Put a sign up there, 'Black Owned,' "because we gonna fix these people "and they're gonna burn Harlem up, burn, burn, burn." - Stores were being broken. Windows were being shattered. At the height of the problem, there was a ring of people around the front door of the Apollo protecting it. I didn't lose a pane of glass. - Well, the Harlem riots actually shouldn't surprise anyone. Our people are still the victims of brutality, and most of them are being brutalized by the police. It's surprising to me that the explosion, the racial explosion, hasn't gotten farther out of hand than it actually has. And it's not a reflection of the ability of the New York Police to contain the negroes in Harlem. It's actually a reflection of the ability of the negroes in Harlem to hold or exercise restraint in the face most severe form of brutality. We don't see any American Dream. We've experienced only the American nightmare. - Hmm. - We haven't benefitted from America's democracy. We've only suffered from America's hypocrisy. And the generation that's coming up now can see it and are not afraid to say it. If you're going to jail, so what? If you're black, you were born in jail. - Mm. - "Black," that's that black. You know what I mean? You were born in jail. - "Black." - Denzel nailed it. - I thought it was Denzel at first. I was like, "Is it?" - We need a New Age Malcolm, man. We need another Malcolm right now. - This is the New Age Malcolm. Teaching this to young people in a way that they get it, I feel like is radical as fuck 'cause it's free. - You gotta read it, though. - Yeah, but it's a starting point, though. It's a freedom. - I would agree to say that we need something that is-- not saying books aren't tangible, but-- - Visceral. - Exactly. - "Prince had been driving to see his fiancée. "He was killed yards from her home. "And the only witness to the killing of Prince Jones "was the killer himself. "He was charged with nothing. "He was punished by no one. He was returned to his work." - Stick your hands up. Let's go. Come on, right this way. - I guess I'm really upset about people overlooking the city, overlooking Harlem. But my fight has just started. My fight now is for the black America become American. - ♪ Uh! ♪ ♪ With your bad self ♪ ♪ Say it louder! ♪ together: ♪ I'm black and I'm proud! ♪ - ♪ Say it louder! ♪ together: ♪ I'm black and I'm proud! ♪ - ♪ Yeah!

You are a negro. - No! - What are you? - I'm black and beautiful. - What's your nationality? - My nationality is Afro-American. - It was at the Apollo in which James Brown got onstage and rally-cried to the community, "I'm black and I'm proud." That wasn't just a performance. That was an opportunity to really be in dialogue about what was happening and how we needed to continually embrace our own identity. together: ♪ I'm black and I'm proud! ♪ Say it louder! together: ♪ I'm black and I'm proud! ♪ - ♪ Ow! ♪ - James Brown, he just encapsulates everything that black America was looking for at that time. - He got rid of that hairdo and grew an Afro. - I actually remember in 1968, I went to my parents and I said, "I'd like to grow a natural."

But if there was no Apollo, there wouldn't be a place for African-American communities to express their artistic visions. We can't see those just slip beneath the waves as if we weren't here. - Business began to fall off, and the Apollo went into bankruptcy. And they closed the theater down. and Grover Washington, Jr.'s Percy Sutton, who was a local leader in Harlem, very well-known, he had been a civil rights attorney. He had represented Malcolm X. He purchased the Apollo out of bankruptcy. - The Apollo had been dark for some time, and my grandfather had this notion to buy the Apollo Theater. He saw the Apollo Theater as a beacon and a spark that could ignite a revitalization of 125th Street. - Percy Sutton called me up to his office, and he had this idea to restore and to bring back the Apollo Theater. And he said, "I would like you to work with me on it." - Bob, what kind of tickets are you buying? - I'm buying Tito Puente. - He's buying Tito Puente from the temporary box office at the Apollo Theater. Pretty soon, you'll have your new box office. - I remember when it reopened, and I remember the way the place looked. It was just so special to all of us, you know what I mean? It was like, wow, we have the Apollo back, and look at it now. You could feel the vibration in the street.

He made a deal with the state, and the state took it over and that's when the Apollo Theater Foundation, a not-for-profit, was formed in order to position ourselves for sustainability. - Because of that flip, we were able to put it on a stable financial basis as a legitimate force in the cultural institution and venue space here in New York City. - ♪ It might seem crazy, what I'm about to say ♪ ♪ Sunshine, she's here, you can take a break ♪ ♪ I'm a hot air balloon that can go to space ♪ ♪ With the air like I don't care ♪ ♪ Baby, by the way ♪ ♪ Because I'm happy ♪ ♪ Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof ♪ - When you think about the music, even the songs that we sing in our own private spaces are so beautiful and speak to something so human that even the people who hold you underneath their boot can't help but sing along. - ♪ Rock steady, baby ♪ ♪ That's what I feel, now ♪ ♪ Let's call this song exactly what it is ♪ ♪ Step and move your hips ♪ ♪ With a feeling from side to side ♪ ♪ Sit yourself down in your car and take a ride ♪ ♪ And while you're moving, rock steady ♪ ♪ Rock steady, baby ♪ ♪ Let's call this song exactly what it is ♪ - ♪ What it is, what it is, what it is ♪ - ♪ It's a funky and low-down feeling ♪ ♪ Move your hips from left to right ♪ ♪ What it is, is I might be doing ♪ ♪ This funky dance all night ♪ - ♪ Wave your hands up in the air ♪ - You just know that when one of these icons passes, people will come to the Apollo and that you know you'll be able to be there with others that are also grieving for the loss of someone that was important in our community. - I think that it has a lot to do with the marquee as well and being under that banner knowing that these people had been here.
