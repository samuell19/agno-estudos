Ten subway lines, another 152 bus lines. One club for every day of the year. Constantly new designer drugs. Dozens of startups a day, 3 million people. An endless amount of genders and lots of traffic. And now...? I don't have a choice. Only one bus, just shitty clubs and Bubenhausen. Now I am being cooked for and the heating's on. Decelerating... so much that I did not only stop the clock but turned it right back. At least that's what I thought. Hello! I have a meeting...at ten. - Good for you. Who are you seeing? - Erm, Mr Langmüller. - The editor-in-chief? - Yes, of course. Sick! Toni! - Chris, from high-school... - Yes! - We haven't met since then, right? - It's been a while. Are you back home again? - No, well... yes, well...no. I actually live in Berlin but I had to take care of some things here... Whatever. What have you done for the past years? - Well, I went to Munich first. Studied some time in Washington D.C. semester abroad in Barcelona and ...just finished my MA in Oxford. The usual... ...you stop and you are overhauled. And someone is always faster than you. Wow, you've been around Mr Held. And now back in our pleasant cit y of Ulm? - Yes, the opportunity of working for you... ...was just very... - Same here. I feel exactly the same way! Absolutley, yes! - Yes, you all seem to be very flexible. Your creative self-exp... What's wrong, Miss Saur? You're making me nervous! - Sorry, can I use the bathroom? - Of course! Down the stairs on the left! - Thank you! No... no, no, no! Fuck! Fuck! No! You won't shake off your expectations that fast. But they will... What else do you need to know? - Nothing actually. Mr Held's CV was very convincing. But you've been for little girls the past 15 minutes. - Did you read m y publications? I have two college degrees, have done several internships... - Oh! I see you're from Bubenhausen! Yes, yes, that makes sense! We are still looking for an intern for our local news department. Disc near, disc far, this disc is dedicated to the German fatherland! Disc near, disc far, this disc is dedicated to Bavaria! I just can't be bothered... - Oh, come on! It's the party of the year. - Mum...I've been to some pretty cool parties and this isn't going to be one of them. - Less partying might have done you some good. - I mean, one page about Shrove Tuesday is a real challenge. I really need to hide my strong disapproval towards this fucked up event. Forget it... not like this! - You haven't seen the best part yet! Shame, you don't really have the boobs for it but maybe this gets you a man. - I'm not going anywhere like this. Such a gender stereotype! - What? - Gender! - Oh, whatever! More, more, more, more... To Schnickale's, to Schnackale's, all people like to go, it's beer and schnapps and other drinks that go down in a flow. Toni! - Fuck off! You smell of schnapps! - Come on, just one carnival kiss! - No carnival kiss! Fuck off! Just fuck off! - Fucking bitch! Frustrated cow! - You frustrate me! Zicke zacke, zicke zacke - hoi, hoi,hoi! What's that? - Yeah, it's not strong. Mostly orange juice, just a little bit of vodka... - Doesn't smell like it. - Some coke. - You can drink that yourself! What's that? Dishwater? - Oh come on, that's a drink for a little girl. - Drink for a little girl? Mair is a little girl. Honestly, you can keep that. Fucking carnival kisses. He's a little girls's drink! Fucking scumbag! He sucks. - Why are you so pissed off? - Because he pisses me off! - What? - I'm so sick of this carnival shit! It's just stupid. - I don't live at my parents anymore. - Where do you live then? - In the commune. - Commune? - Yeah! - What's that "commune"? - A shared house! - A shared house? - Yes! - There's a shared house in Bubenhausen? - In Bubenhausen! - In Bubenhausen... Dude, shit's going down in Bubenhausen! Do you have cows, t oo? - Erm, bees! - Bees? Like, bees? - Yeah, we do! - Like a whole hive of actual bees? Do they live in...what's it called... - Well, a beehive? - They do, right? - Yeah - I'm sick of this, I think I'm heading off now. - No, have a drink. That will make you lose up! It's great that you're back! Zicke zacke, zicke zacke, hoi, hoi, hoi! hoe's lumpen, goat's legs, hoi, hoi, hoi! Hey, stand up. The bus is coming. SHUT UP! I'm telling you! If anyone pukes in my bus I'm going to kick your ass! Get in! - Is this a smokers' bus? - No! No cigarettes in the bus! Mr Langmüller? I'm on it. Of course, I can! All right! Hello! Which family are you from? - The Saur Franz'. - Oh, Saur Franz. Well, all right then! Oh dear, auntie bit the dust really quickly! - Twenty years too late! - No wonder... - What? - That your daughter got the Old Inn. - My daughter? ...who didn't come to visit anyone. Neither her aunt nor to us. - And you? - And me? - Who trimmed the hedge every year? - Every two years! And she spent the past 15 years in a nursing home. - Anyways, this is going to be my goldmine! In the rush of exuberance absurdity even makes the petit bourgeois enjoy idiocy. Here's to lunacy! When the Swabian ego hides behind bear costumes, witches, maggots and hunchback interpretations- they have an official permission to lose their mind, employer and emplo yee meet in the bathroom - pissing and full of bliss, the hierarchy of every day life is momentarily suspended. I see. Carnival with an overdose. Are you out of your mind? Who do you think you are? The pioneer of Swabian gonzo journalism? People want to know which clubs were present. That the old and young had lots of fun. That everybody peacefully celebrated all night. Overdose? You know what? You look like an overdose! HELD! Find all articles of the past three years and write, based on the pictures... Did you manage to take pictures!? Thanks! Write a new article based on the photos. Objective language. Got it? You can do this! And you Miss Saur from now on there's only the diamonds of coverage for you. And then you can really show me, what you've got, girl! Fuck! Hi! - You can't be serious. - You like it? - That burns! - No rings! Your dad won't eat those! - What does dad eat then? - Small dice! Very small dice! - Mum, it's burning! That shit's in... - Come on, take a sip of water. - Some meat, too. Not just sauerkraut. - There's no roast today. Today it's sauerkraut noodles. - Where's the meat? Do you have a microscope or magnifying glass? - Here, you can have mine. - Yours? What's wrong with you? - Wrong with me? I've never eaten meat! - You're picking at your food like a hen! - Then you are a rooster! So, do you want the meat? - Horrible! It looks absolutely horrible! - What looks horrible? - That hair! - Hair? Where? - Here! She means my hair. - Ah, okay. - Looks good, right? - Sure. - But you do know that we have a meeting at the bank this afternoon!? - We do? - Yes. Yes, we do. - Today? - Today! - Forget about that! I have a Skype date today. - You're funny! Skype date, Skype date... - Do you know what that is? - Of course I know what that is. - That's fucking crap. - It's not fucking crap. - You are the heir of this shebang. Now we need to get rid of it. - Yes, but you can't just... - There's a meeting at the bank! Today at half past two! - Since when? Why didn't you tell me? - I did tell you! You forgot about it! Fucking Skype date! House St. Afra, Rosa Baur speaking. Father Robert is making the rotar. All right! Bye! Hey, how are you? Ah, Toni! Hey, Toni! Hi, yes, sure. I hope m y boss is okay with me leaving a bit earlier. - Hello everybody! Good day! Are you doing okay? - Yes. - Do you feel comfortable in our house? - Haha, no way! - You're fine. That's great. - Mate, your mum is flipping out! - Miss Baur? Miss Baur! Rosa? Hello? - Erm, Toni? I've got to go! Yep, bye! This is my balance. - That's not what that is. This is pathetic. You can't call this a fucking bank account. - Okay, let's go. You don't need to look. - This is my job and you've better watch it. - Mr Saur, this is not going anywhere. - I can't give you anymore money It's just not worth it. - I'd like t o know what you are worth! - Dad! I think that's a lot of money. Let's do this. - I'm not getting screwed over by this little school girl. - Daddy, let's just do this so it's over. - We are not! - Then it's finally over! - You have no idea! - Stand up! We are leaving! Stand up! Who's negotiating here? Me or the bank? - It's not hard to figure out how she got that job! Enjoy your lives... as the light is still glowing... Pick the rose... before she fades. Thank you on behalf of the singers. Thank you t o the press. - Thank you. - Um, I'm interviewing someone here... - Impossible. - This is an international choir. Thankfully we have lots of members from other cultures. - Okay and you? - I've been in the club for more than five years. - The first Asian in the choir. What does it feel like? - Very nice! Very go od! - How did people act towards you at the beginning? - Open minded and friendly, like a family. - Yes, like a family. - And now Linda even teaches us some Filipino. - Really? - I can say: Maayong gabii. Hello Mr Langmüller, Antonia Saur speaking. I just wanted to ask... You sent me to this choir, which was very interesting, sociologically speaking. I think there's a good story... Yes, I took the photo. Yes, with the mayor. I just wanted to ask... if I could write m ore... ...maybe a longer... Mr Langmüller? - ...so that he becomes more secure with conducting... I hate, hate, hate you, you fucking wanker! You patriarchal co ck! I hate you! Macho! Dumb asshole! Go and write the fucking thing yourself! - Bye. - Bye. - One more cigarette and then I'll light the fire. - Great. - That's what we will do. I always put m y guitar on my back and get on m y turnpike... erm motorbike. - I'm so looking forward to summer. It'll be awesome. - The gnats. The m osquitos. - Mosquitos? Ah, I hate mosquitos. They always bite me, always! - They do? - I hate it. - You should come to the lake with me. - So they bite you. - No, no, then they bite YOU! - Last year, we put all the beer in the lake to have it chilled. And then we lost all our beer. - I went in with m y diving goggles which were way t oo small. - It's been five years. - Yes, we've been here for five years. - I think I've only been here for three. - Did you move out of your parents' that long ago? - Yes. - Really? - It's been real fun since she's been here. - I'm sure it has. - Cheers, then! - Cheers! - Hi and cheers! - Hey you! - Oh, God. - I need a beer and a sweater. It's kind of cold. - Where have you been? - At my m om's choir. - And now I can write three whole lines. Wow. - That's why I spent seven years in college. - You should have just got a real job. - Haha. Funny. - I'm so sick of it. You have no idea. When I go to the office tom orrow nobody cares. No one fucking turns around. I don't know. I took the wrong turn somewhere. - Yes, but why? - I have no idea. You all have no idea! - At least you can live with your parents! - It's hell. With my m om? It's pure hell. That woman is driving me nuts. I can't do anything. I can't wear what I want. "Don't wear this. That looks awful. What will the neighbors think?" She comments on all of it. You have no idea. Every single step. I do what I can and my mom is just... She suffocates me. And then...writing three lines... three fucking lines! How am I supposed to write more with a mum like this? - At least m y mom can sm oke and drink whenever she wants. - No. She is in Somalia. I miss her. Oh wow! I wouldn't have thought that. That the aunt left you the Inn... She didn't. My daughter got it - Toni. - Okay! And what do you want? - I am her...her manager. - Let's take a closer look. - This is a nice little room. You could fit a small family in here. A small family? On 86 square feet? - Oh, sure. Do you know where they come from? They come from caves. - This is all very... - Some new windows here, for sure. - I know... - You know exactly what you owe me. - Yes, I know. I owe you a favour. - I want to smell some bills. And this ro om can fit 20 bunk beds. Are you the county commissioner or not? - Here, have a look again. - I'm going to fix it. Make it work. - Because you always fixed it, right? - Yes, I always did. - We have always worked it all out, but... - ...still works! - There are rats living down here, isn't there? - No way! Can you see any rat shit here? - I can't. - It's dry up there and everything. Not much fixing needed. - I can see that. The whole thing is about to come off. - It can be remodeled quickly. No problem at all. You know how things work. - Oh, dear! - I'm on it. Don't worry. - Here, read this... they can read that... - Never forget your home, where your cradle was. You won't find a home away from home. - See! - It's your turn now. It's crazy, I haven't been here for so long. There's always this silence in the air. - Yes, that's right. - Whenever people had nothing to say or couldn't say anything they would sit here. Why did you go down? - I don't know. I thought I wasn't allowed in here. - Of course you are allowed in here. - Why did you go down? - Because you did. - He'll come up here. What should I say? - I don't know... Let's just stand up now. - No, we won't. How will that come across? - Girls, what are you doing here? Rose without thorns. Oh Maria, help. You, chosen by god. Oh Maria, help. Maria, help us all out of our deep misery. Hi. - Hi. - Finished? - Pfiffi ran away. - Pfiffi! Pfiffi, Pfiffi. - Pfiffi! - Pfiffi! Get the stick! Good boy! There he is! There he is, my little boy! - Um, isn't he a she? - Just looks like it. She's calling you a girl... - You're such a good boy! - Mair? - Such a good one. - Mair? So give us the key for the shed! - Are you crazy? - Tonight. - Are you crazy? No way! - Oh, yes. No! Okay, it's open. I remember it somewhat differently. Helene Fischer is actually called Jelena Petrovna Fischer. - For real? - Mhm. But I guess that a Russian name isn't a marketing director's dream. - Okay. - So they probably didn't notice that they chose a Greek name... They're going be be very thrilled about your art. - Why? At least nobody can stare at their hot Helene anymore. - Do you really think it is like that? - Hm? - That they're being forced? - Performing on stage half-naked? - No, to cover up. Oh no burka-bashing for once. Honestly, has anyone ever asked us if we wanted to go to church every Sunday? - "Roosaaaa, go to church now." and I was like "No!" "You're serving at the altar!" Now wait! I'll light it for you in a sec. OK. If it wasn't for my m om, I'd already be out. - Out of what? - Church, you know. - Really? - Mhm. - You wouldn't or what? - Nope. - Really? - It's important to me. - Okay. - I like going to church. From time to time. It didn't do you any harm. - No... - They would have burnt you first. - Right. - Oh well. - They would have burnt you, t oo. - Why? - Just a feeling. - Because of my nose, right? - What? - Because of my nose? - I once saved up money for a nose job. And bigger boobs. I just wanted to have bigger ones. - I'd love to have smaller boobs. - How much do you think they weight? - Not enough. - Just a little bit... now come here. - You're nuts. - That could be it. Wait. One is enough. Not kidding. Mmmmh...awesome. - Are you crazy? - What's wrong? - It's the conductor's garden! - I'll ring the doorbell then! - Stop it! - I will. - No. No. No. - Oh yes, I will. - No, stop it! - Come on. - Stop it now! - No, please. Just st op! - Ah, come on! - Just don't. I'm begging you. Stop. - Is Rosa scared? - Yes. - Aw, is Rosa scared? - Just stop. Please. - Stop! - Okay. - No. No! - Come, Rosa. Come here, now! - Stop it now! - Rosa, I'll count to three and then I'll ring. Rosa. - He's gonna yell at me. - Don't be a baby.- Stop! Ok, come here or I'll do it. One, two. I'll do it if you don't come here. Three. - No, stop. This is very clear. This is an attack on societ y, I'm telling you. - Attack? This is personal. This is an attack on me. - Yes, on us. - On us, especially. - On us. And I saw it on the news. Saw it yesterday. Rigaer Street, Berlin, Black Block. All that stuff. Berlin Mitte and so on. - Oh stop it with Berlin. Don't get me started on Berlin. We are here. - It's gonna get here slowly. - And we are working our asses off. Driving around here, driving around there. Here and there. - That's what it is. - And now this is what I have to read. This is personal. And then that letter and Traudl in Warsaw. - Also? - What's going on here? Who made this mess? - Can't you read? No idea. We just saw it. - Who's the one with a clue here? - We took a sample. Over and out. - This case is too big for you. This is political. - All you lot do is harass people, take away driver's licenses... hide behind hedges! - Franz! Mr Saur! Surnames now! - Absolutely not. - I'm on dut y. ID, please. - This is an official identity check now. - Shut up and give me your ID. - I'm not doing anything. - I've had it! Damn it! - I'm not taking it out because you know who I bloody am. - Maybe he sprayed it there himself. - Yes, possibly. - Yes, probably. We've got everything we need. Good bye, Mr Saur. You will hear from us! - Wankers. - Such a stupid...I can't believe... - This is who...oh, come on. - Kiss m y ass! - The best two in the county. - Obviously. Africans. Without a doubt. - Hi! - Oh, hi. - Who are you again? - Toni. Antonia. - Hello, hi! And how are you? Fine, right? Okay, bye bye. - He's cute. - He didn't want to recognize you with your ugly hair. - It's ok, mum. - Hey guys. - Hi! - Hello. - Tell me, do you know them? - Sure, they're always at Rosa's. At work. - It's weird. - What's wrong with you now? - Well, strange people everywhere. Soon, you will not know anyone. - There are 20 people to be precise. - Yes, but their culture is so different. You don't know their ways, the Negros'. - Please don't say Negro. - Why? It's just a normal word. I've been saying this since I was just a kid. I always forget her name. - I think it's Amal. Mahamoud, do you know her? - Anita. - Anita? They are here, so they should adapt to our culture. - To yours or mine? I thought today was for relaxing? - Yes, for you. That's usually your thing. - But it's all up to me anyway. Do you really think that'll help THAT body? - Oh, I'm so excited. - I've never been to Christopher Street Day. - Really? I always went in Berlin. - Really? - Honestly, I'm just happy to get out for once. - I have always seen that on TV. - Hi. - Hey there. - Cool that these things exist. What a fucking hottie! Hi! - Hi! - Hi! - And? Who's the driver? - I am! - Thanks. - Those are huge! - Amazing, right? You want some, too? - Nope. - Shame, they would suit you. - Me? - Yeah, with a cheetah print... - Conny? - Hm? - What's her name again? - That's Emma. Don't you know her? - Who's Emma? - Rosas's ex. - Really? - Yeah, she's really nice. - They were the perfect couple. - Absolutely. Amazing. - I still don't get why they broke up, honestly! - They were dating for four years. - Really? - I think so. Forever... - Every time you saw them... - Great! - Yeah! - They broke up 6 months ago. - But maybe tonight...? - There you are! I've tried to call you...where have you been? - In the bathroom. - So you can't just tell me? I've been looking for you... - Bar! - I'll join you later. - Cheers! - Yeah! - Four Gin Tonics, please. It's so cool here. - Hey, do you always look this miserable? - Hm? - Do you always Io ok this miserable? Asshole. Gin and Tonic, please. One Gin Tonic. Excuse me? The world doesn't revolve around you... Honey. Where's Toni? - I don't know. Toni! I'll leave for aunt Baerbel's birthday. At least you could watch your cousins... ...if you have nothing better t o do. - Okay. My husband should really lose some weight. With his big belly we'll have to roll him so on. - Hello. - Well, hello Tina. - Oh, what's that? I've never seen anything like it. - Dumplings made from so y. Without any glutamate. - The egg liqueur is delicious. - Finished in 6 minutes. - No? - Really? - Sure. But you need great eggs. - High-quality ones. Not the supermarket ones. - No. - Are those free-range eggs? - Spreads, egg liqueur... - Hello... - Hey there! - And? Is she still? - What? - A lesbian? - Yes, I think she is. Those two aren't dating anymore, but sure, she still is one. - Can't she find a man or is she really that way? - No, I think she doesn't want a man. - She's doing that. - Yeah, yeah yeah. - She's always been different. Even in kindergarten. She never played with dolls, only with the boys building lego houses. - That's funny. That's so her. - She always had to act special. - Well I think that gay men are always so well-dressed. - They are such hotties, you know. I wouldn't mind having them in my bed. - But they would. I have known you for quite some time. - Mhm. - I feel that something's wrong. Is it because of Toni? You can tell me. I don't mind. Talk to me. Tell me, what's wrong? - It's great. They come here for free. - So it costs nothing. - Costs nothing. - Transport as well? - Transport as well. - I have to make sure to negotiate some m ore. - Oh, shit! - Hey girl. - And Hofer, how are we proceeding? - I have the best relations with the church, you know that. We have done some business with them and they have always been great. They pray for me at night. You know Father Robert from the m onastery. - Why are you so afraid, Mrs Saur? - What do I know? Everything's spinning around so quickly... I can't keep up... It doesn't even matter what I think. - You have to let go. Mrs Saur. Just let go. Go od Lord, we're thirst y! - Hey! Everybody stop. Rosa, do you always have to mess it up? How often do we have to practice it? When they sing "Good Lord, we're thirsty" nobody plays but the tuba. - I did not play there. - Who was it then? - I don't know? - Your partners weren't. That was you. - Really? - You need to stop four beats before that, too. - Ah, okay. - You didn't see that, did you? - No. - Let's hear the trombones alone. And the drums. Let's start from the trio. All three trombones. One...do you know where? Trio. - Fourth line, right? - There. - There it says: Trio. So. One, two. Shhh, stop. Rosa, play it on your own. Your partners do it right but you don't. Come on, just play it alone. - No, I'm not playing alone. - What if your colleagues weren't here? Then I quit. - What are you doing? - I have other problems. Your dumb trio isn't one of them. - We can also do this: I quit. This is making me mad anyways. Lo ok, how few have come. Where are the flutes? - We don't want to come here anymore either. We only play stupid old songs. It's no surprise people don't show up. We can't play m odern pieces with this few people. I have said this t oo many times. That's it for me today. - Come on. Stay here. - No, bye. Antonia. - What? - Come on now. There's mass. - So? - For our aunt. - But you know that you worship other gods, don't you? - Yes, it's okay. - Hi. - Hello. - This is all Rosa's fault. - What is Rosa's business here? She doesn't even do yoga. - She is all about that nonsense. - Nonsense? Which nonsense? - Hey there!- Hello. - That's not normal. That is against nature. - You are against nature. Getting worked up all day. I don't get it. I did some yoga. What's Rosa got t o do with it? I don't get it. - Yes, but Rosa is queer. - Hey you. - Hello. - You don't have to take part in every single shitty thing. Just act normal. Maybe this is what people do in Berlin, but not here. Here the world is still intact. The world doesn't revolve around your stupid hillbilly town. You have to m ove along with the world. - People are walking down to church, you can't go past them! I invested half my life to raise that kid. I'm really beginning to wonder if it was worth it. Antonia! It's Corpus Christi! They put up the May-tree and afterwards, they went in, had some coffee had some snacks. Beer, of course. - Hi! - And meanwhile the tree got stolen. - No way! Hi! - Hi! - Hey. - That wouldn't have happened to me! I sit right under it with m y beer just in case they want to steal it. Fucking stupid! - Right! But whatever... So they had to get a new one. It was beautiful. The church parade. It was like back in the day. Can I show you something? Wow, sick! Crazy. Look. DJ Michael? - Mhm. - What do you think is on the cassette? Think about it. How long it has been like this. Hey, smell this. It doesn't stink. Smell it. It doesn't stink like anything. The parties that went down in here. I think my mum and dad actually met here. Dad always...well, mum once said it took them a while until he decided he wanted her. Well, that's how it is. You know, there have been real...um Rosa? - Hm? - There have been real theater plays. Do you know how old the stage design is? It's from 1973. Chairs and chairs and chairs.... Right to the back. Exclusively...today... For Rosa only. I present Techno Toni. - Ah ok. - And she also sings no song. Father Robert. - Good day, Mrs Saur. I was expecting your husband. - He's late. But I'll show you around. - Nice. - I was looking for the keys forever... Oh, it's unlo cked. - Even better. - If I had known, I would have washed the dishes. - Antonia! You're making a scene! I know something troubles you, Miss Baur. No, I have to get back to... - One m oment. We both know what happened, right? I have to get back to the café... - If we confess our sins, God is faithful and just. He forgives our sins. And cleanses every injustice. I pray for you every day. Believe me. And, my god, you are just a little confused. That can happen in times like these. - Yes, confused...confused. I think this is taking the wrong direction. Father Robert. - And there it is in the Epistle of the Corinthians that it is possible for every human to turn around to begin a life pleasing to God. - Yes, but I don't want to turn around and the Corinthians won't help me. - Show me that you love God's son, because Jesus loves you too. - I don't know what you want from me. I love women. - One second. This isn't what it's about, right? I am also speaking to you as your boss. - Yes and I also have a private life. - Yes, of course. - And I believe that I am here wholeheartedly for minimum wage. - Don't speak to me like this! - Think about how you speak with me! - Listen, are you ready to turn around or not? - No, I fucking won't. - Then I am forced to transfer you. I'm sorry. - What do you want from me? - I don't have a choice. You work with young people. And I am responsible here. - Fuck you! You coward scumbag. I know exactly what you're doing. Because I am living what you dream of at night. Oh dear... - It's really hot today. Were we a bit to o tough with him? - Damn hot. - No...they deserved it. - You think so? - Sure. - Ah, don't worry. - Well, I kind of... - Law and order. - I have mixed feelings... - You have to take drastic measures. And my God, that little scrat ch... - But if I think about it, I start feeling different. - ...between love and hate! When will I finally go this way - Hey! Look! It's on! Quick! Shit! Good day. Hello. Have we been driving a little fast? - Nope. - Vehicle spot check. Oh. But you know what kind of music you're listening to? So. Have you smoked? - No. - Have you done any other drugs? - No. - You're eyes are all red. Admit it, you have smoked something. - I'm not allowed to sm oke what I want... ...to fuck who I want to. Am I not even allowed to listen to what I want? - And, of course... fuck the system, right? - Yeah, fuck the system. - Ha, fuck the system. - Fuck the system. Well, let's walk around the car. Because the system is very interested. What kind of fuck is in your car. Goddammit. - You have to come over. - I'll just drive on now...ok? - Nope. Nothing's ok. - Yes, why? There isn't anything. - What a mess back here. - Woah...oh my... - Eww, gross! Keep looking over there. There's also something up here, amazing. Unbelievable...all that stuff... Ah, it's just the same as in the front. - Sensational. - That has absolutely nothing to do with...does it? - And what do we have here? One. Two. Three. - These are all empty. - Four, Five. - The cheap stuff. Can't you afford some proper drinks? That shit is going to give you headache. - And of course. Beach guitar. And a sleeping bag. - Oh! - You got something? - Oh! Oh! I can smell a rat. - What have we got here? - That's oregano. It belongs in the spice rack in the front. - Recognize it? Police party... - We always come back to it. History repeats itself. Amazing. We are taking that back to the police department. - We sure will. - Now let's check what type of oregano that is. Rosa, honestly. It's the 21st century. This is not ok. I mean your boss. - Toni, leave it. - Your private life is none of your boss' damn business! - A ccept it. It is what it is. - It's okay. - You can't tolerate this! - Yes, I can. - No, how do you... - I used to think that I was insane. I thought I was the only one. I thought, there's no one else in the world. But me. People went up to my parents and expressed their condolences and everyone hoped it would just be a phase. But it wasn't. And I can't take it any longer. If he thinks he can manage on his own... I'm done. I have no chance to return. Chris Held Tony, hey. Lo ok, working conditions for church emplo yees are hypocritical. Okay? That sounds interesting! Basic principles of clerical emplo yment within the framework of clerical working conditions. Social work is being financed with only 2% by the church. The majority is still paid by the state. And we have to admit that our churches' brotherly love stops when we talk homosexuality. Think about it, face the reality! This is Toni Saur's mailbox.

Carnica? - It's about male bees. - Aha. - Yes. It's really like that... male bees are very lazy. They don't do anything. They only exist to fertilize. And then... They don't go outside. Don't collect any honey... No nectar, no pollen... they just sit inside. They're even fed if needed. And before winter comes, the girls get radical and kick all the boys out. - What? - They really do. - Oh, shit! All we ever have is meat. And?

The stupid comments, over and over. And I just laugh. Everybody just laughs. You do, too. I laugh even though I'm being laughed about. Why are you here? You know you fucked up. And now you're sorry. But I know that you'd do it again. Just the same. - Yes, you would. - No. - Because you don't want to hear it. You never wanted t o hear it. That's why we should have talked for some time now. I don't talk to you because I know that you don't want to talk to me. I don't know what you want from me. You probably don't even know what you want from yourself. Or you're just very alone or you were or I don't know. But I don't want this anymore. None of this. Good morning. - Oh, hey! Good morning. - Why are you up already? - Tobi and Dani are in hospital having the baby. - Oh, thank god. - That's right. - Oh, man. So there will be five of us so on. And you?
