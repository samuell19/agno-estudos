Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad - What did you say? - The 100th Anniversary Performance... ...is not going to be held. It's been cancelled. You all go prepare first. Let's gather in a while. Where are you going? I'm going to see the president. Could it have been because of me again? You didn't do anything wrong. The director will take care of it. What on earth is going on? I have nothing to say either. Where is Hee Joo's mother, no, that great Madam Chairwoman, now? She just left. You can try chasing after her. I'm sorry, I can't solve it. Wait a moment. What is the reason for your doing this? Didn't you hear it from the president? From the beginning, there hasn't been a day of peace. Those have already been dealt with. Everything is going very well now. Regardless of whether the performance is good or not, I don't like to hear people gossip. I'm sorry. Is it because of Hee Joo? If nothing has happened to Hee Joo, then there would be no reason to do this. I've decided this together with Hee Joo. The Chairman also made the decision. Anyway, I'm very sorry. This must have been your doing, right? What do you mean by that? Other than finding you annoying and disliking you, I'm also Department Head. Do you think I'm responsible for the 100th Anniversary Performance ending up like this? I don't know why, but that's exactly what I think. This fellow! It's because you are like that that things have become like this. Yeo Jun Hee Give Han Hee Joo another call. She's turned off her phone. - That's really terrible. - I'll go look for her. Director! From now on, the 100th Anniversary Performance has been cancelled. You've worked hard all this time. As the Director, I've been unable to preserve the performance. - I'm sorry. - Director! No way... What do we do? Director. Episode 13 Fly Up I've cancelled the 100th Anniversary Performance. I didn't say anything about your illness, so in future be careful not to reveal it. I've already booked the date for the surgery. You should look after yourself properly instead. After you recover, you must do well next year. Hee Joo unni! Hee Joo unni! Hee Joo unni! - What is that noise? - Hee Joo unni! Hee Joo unni! - Yeo Jun Hee? - Hee Joo unni! Hee Joo unni! Unni! Unni, the 100th Anniversary Performance has been cancelled. - What happened? - Why ask me that? Is it also true that you said you didn't want to participate? - It's true. - That's impossible. I know very well how much you wanted to participate in the performance. What do you know? I don't want to see you! Leave! And don't ever come here again. Unni, I believe in you, and I will wait until unni comes back. Unni, you must come. Do you want to go watch a tragedy? No. Then have you gone to the amusement park and ridden on the rollercoaster before? Now's not the time. I wanted to let you be able to cry freely, to scream and shout, without people passing judgment. I'm very sad. I know. I'm also very, very upset. I remember at the beginning, I didn't understand why I had to participate and make it so difficult for myself. Just do well next year. Perhaps. Would I be able to act next year? Also, the director wouldn't be around next year. I don't want to act anymore. Even so, don't you still have a lot of memories? You've gained the hottest guy... ...in the Arts and Culture University, Lee Shin. Isn't that enough for you? You arrogant jerk. It's not arrogance, but that I'm really very good-looking. The cafeteria doesn't sell beer, so will this do? - Thanks. - Then, how about we go eat? I discovered a shop which makes very good jjambbong (spicy noodles). Only by eating something spicy right now can we lift our spirits. Yoon Soo. I understand your intentions, but right now, I want to be alone. - Okay. - It's too embarrassing. I thought that I was only good at this. This isn't your fault. I'm very sorry that I couldn't be standing by your side from the beginning. I won't worry about you, okay? I can believe in Kim Seok Hyun, right? Thank you. This is Kim Seok Hyun. I'm currently in the midst of some issues, can't we meet another time? Yes. I am Kim Ho Jin. I heard the performance you're directing at your alma mater is awash. Yeah... Has the news spread so fast? Haven't there always been many people who are interested in it? - What's your point? - About that... Have you had any thoughts about returning to Broadway? You know about the musical Roseanna that's been running for the past 3 years? They're thinking of opening on Broadway. Even though it's been made public, there's been significant progress. The Broadway people have been recommending Director Kim Seok Hyun. - Here, the coffee is served. - Yes, thank you. Excuse me, what are you discussing that's so serious? - It's nothing important. - I didn't think it was anything important. What's going on? They said it was an internal adjustment. There's not much time left. It's too much. Don't be too upset. When I was in school, something like that happened as well. Back then, we felt that it would be a waste of our practice, so we performed outside our school gates. It was a debacle. You don't have to perform publicly... ...in front of a huge audience to take pride in yourself. There will definitely be other opportunities. Yeah. How is that musical or something progressing? The performance is going to be soon. Why isn't there any news about it? About that, it's not going to be held anymore. What do you mean it's not going to be held? Have you been fired? It's been cancelled. I've never seen something with so much gossip and changes succeed before. That's also why I didn't want you to be involved in western music. Just train properly in the gayageum. Grandfather never says anything good about western music. Then should I call it "loud-nose music"? Grandfather! Is anyone in? Kyu Won? We're eating! Who is it? I'm sorry to have interrupted your meal. If you are you here to listen to my Gugak life story, I'll tell it to you after I finish eating. It's not because of that. I wanted to talk to Kyu Won. I'll just be a while. What's the matter? You've even come here to look for me. Do you want to perform the 100th Anniversary performance on our own? - What for? - Just to do it once. Even if there wouldn't be a grand stage or audience, but as long as Director Kim helps, we can do it on our own. - But we don't even have Han Hee Joo. - You're enough. Why do we need Han Hee Joo? Let's do it once. Isn't it such a waste of our practice? Will the others support it? At least The Stupid and the Windflowers will support it, right? Okay, let's do it. Do artists need an audience to perform? Are they only thinking of this now? Look at this. You were inattentive so the soup tastes wrong. I will take it seriously! As long as you let me participate, I will work hard at it, no matter what the role. - Director! Director! - How have you all been? I'm so popular! What is this? A beautiful woman like you here alone? I was too bored. Even if I go home, I can't sleep, so I wanted to have a drink. It's because of Seok Hyun, right? Is he going to New York? What do you mean? Didn't you know that someone from Broadway came to invite Seok Hyun back? God, then what am I? Really! I'm not the bringer of bad news. You've already said it, why are you still holding back? - What is it? - I wasn't the one who told you. You discovered this on your own first. Earlier someone associated with a performance... came to invite Seok Hyun to Broadway. I thought you'd be the first person he told. Perhaps Seok Hyun also needs some time to consider. Oppa, let's participate together! Join in! Join in! You are the person who is most able to persuade the Director. You'll help us, won't you? Who was the one who thought up such a brilliant idea? If Lee Shin backs out, I'll participate. - What? - You're kidding. You'll participate, right? I can't escape this time either, can I? Oppa, then you're in! What are you doing? This doesn't seem to be the time to be happy. We've decided to hold the cancelled 100th Anniversary Performance on our own. We just need the Director's permission. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to dash your hopes. - The Director is going to Broadway. - What? He just returned to pack his things, and will be leaving soon. Shin! Kyu Won! - Director! - Director! Director, you didn't even say a word to us. - How could you do that? - That's really despicable. Punk, do you know what honor is? The 100th Anniversary Performance has already been cancelled, - so I can't stay on either. - We're going to hold a performance. - What? - The kids want to try. Director, help us. All my relatives already know about my participation in this. If I don't participate, it will really shame my family. - It's so embarrassing! - Really! I really thought such situations could only be found in movies. - If it were me, I'd agree already. - Director. - Please. - If not for you, Director, I'd have taken the civil service examination and passed already. I... really! Is the civil service examination the most important thing now? You're all obstructing my path to Broadway. If you don't do well, I'm going to sue you all for damages, got it? It hurts. Here. There's e-mail and messaging, so many methods of communication. Really, what age is this, that he's still writing letters? I really don't know which planet he's from. He's not a normal kid in the first place. If I talk too much my throat hurts. Please go out. Because I, the pauper, fell in love with the beautiful Natasha, so tonight the snow is falling. Being in love with Natasha, the snow is also falling. I sit alone in loneliness, eating my chocolate bar. Why did a chocolate bar appear here? It's really lacking heart. Can you feel my passionate heart? Fool. From a distant past I know you're the love I've been dreaming of Let's always be together Even after a long time passes Unni, I believe you will come. Even though Chairman Lee opposes the 100th Anniversary Performance, you want to revive the performance? Does that make sense? It does. But I think... that we just need to remove the "100th Anniversary" in front. It's a performance we prepared on our own anyway, so it shouldn't matter, right? Kim Seok Hyun! Are you really going to continue to be like this? I also graduated from this university, and that label will follow me all my life. I would certainly not do anything that would tarnish the university's image. There's no budget at all. The university can't come up with it, and we've lost all our sponsors. We should starve for art in the first place. Even so, if you would voluntarily donate some money, - I'd appreciate it. - So you mean... you're going to lead those kids in a performance by yourself? I'll be helping as well. If I was back in my schooldays, and the same thing happened, I think that I would do the same thing. You're here. Sit here. That's right, you're here, too. The performing team and the musical accompaniment team, everyone's here. Aren't you even a little afraid? The university doesn't have any budget for sponsorship anymore, and there's no longer anyone backing us. We also no longer have a stage on which to perform. - Can we continue? - We can! In order to raise funds for the performance, how about we hold a fundraiser? We should also hold a One Day Teahouse! I'd like to donate this month's salary from my job at Catharsis to the performance. - That's just like Shin. - Don't be so obvious! The 52,000 Won I saved for a nose job during the summer. Your nose now is also very pretty. - You have a famous nose. - Really?! Oppa! Really! Is the university performance more important than Broadway? Furthermore, didn't you say you didn't gain formal recognition? If you want to advance to Broadway, there's more that you need to learn. The actors there... generally aren't participating in performances to gain formal recognition. All of them gained their roles by working hard behind the scenes on their own. You're really not doing it? - My apologies. - Very well then. Just consider that all this never happened. Kim Seok Hyun. - You were eavesdropping again. - Are you crazy? How could you decline an invitation to Broadway? I'm so proud to have a friend like you. Move away from me. Previously you also eavesdropped and then told Yoon Soo, didn't you? I didn't tell Yoon Soo first, she guessed it first, so I had no choice but to... - tell her. Yes, tell her. - You blabbermouth. Don't just talk about those things, but about these things as well, such as how handsome I am and the like. Do you want me to pass that on? Got it. The three broadcasters, six major newspapers, the university bulletin, and the internet. I'll announce it on all of them that Kim Seok Hyun is so handsome! - Seok Hyun, I'm so proud! - Go away! So tired! Shall we buy some snacks to eat? - I'll go buy. - It's no fun to go alone. Let's go together. Come back soon. It'll be good if things can go smoothly this time. I'm going outside for a while. There's so much to color. Where are you going? - I'm going to the washroom. - Cha Bo Woon! Don't bother about it. - Finally, she's being perceptive. - What? Every time we're alone together she comes between us. I've finally gained some eye power to make her leave. But we're really busy now. Aren't you the expert in this area? Now that I think about it, yes. I'm very sorry that I didn't make the appointment then. It's okay. Thanks to you, we sold quite a lot of tickets then. Even though business wasn't very good. Don't worry, this time I'll get you more. - How? - Wait and see. Excuse me. Can I come in? After I left, I realized that there wasn't any place I could go. Come on in and do these. I'm not asking you, I'm asking Lee Shin. - Come on in. - Thank you! With difficulty, we've managed to get permission to use the lecture theatre, but it looks like the stage will be a little small. I'm afraid the dance will have to be significantly re-choreographed. I knew it be this way, so I've already thought of a plan. Since it's like that, the other areas should also be changed. I heard you flatly rejected the Broadway offer. - Did you hear that from Goo Jung? - Didn't you ask him to pass it on? That guy really passes such things on really quickly. Don't you feel that it's a pity? Looks like you still don't really understand me. There are many other places that invite me, even if it doesn't. Of course. If the opportunity arises, would you go with me? - What? - Is it going to rain soon? - Why does my waist suddenly ache? - Really! I'll consider it. But Professor Jung Yoon Soo, please spend some effort in choreographing the dance. Lee Kyu Won is still very weak in dance, so I hope you'll give her some extra guidance. I got it. You've looked so favorably upon Kyu Won. It's finally of some use. She isn't aware of the abilities she possesses. I can see it very clearly, and wish to help her see it. I feel it is a pity that the obstructive people around feel that way, which is why I care even more. In the end, it's caused a lot of unnecessary misunderstandings. After the performance is over, Kyu Won will also understand some things. - Will she? - Of course. Really! I don't find it amusing anymore. It's not a kindergarten performance, they're saying that they're going to raise their own funds to hold the performance? What can they do when they don't even have you? However, why does that beggar-like fellow keep coming? He keeps sitting there waiting. He seems to have lost too much weight. We should call the police tomorrow. One two three four, five six seven eight. One two three four, five six seven eight. Tiptoe! Take a break, then we'll practice some more. Okay. Here. You've improved a lot. Good job. Thank you. - Is it okay? - What? I heard this musical's story is based on Professor and Director. Why are you suddenly asking this? If it wasn't okay, would I agree to it? While reading the dialogue, I was thinking about this and that. Why did you leave Director back then? Because I was young. Back then, I thought I could do anything. I felt that this wasn't everything, and I could only look forward. There was nothing to be afraid of, nothing to regret. If it were you, what would you do? - What? - If, when the musical is over, there's a proposal that would let you stand on the Broadway stage, what would you do? I'd reject it, I guess. You'd reject it? Honestly, this musical is the first, and last, for me. It was very difficult to gain my grandfather's permission. After it's over, I'll have to return to the gayageum. I'm not asking for your grandfather's opinion, but yours. Even though I broke up with Seok Hyun then, I don't regret my decision. That's youth. Let's practice. Okay. You're not a runaway, so why are you carrying your luggage around? Don't say that. I'm not in a good mood now. Even at my age, I still have to face my father's temper. If it were me, my temper would have cooled a long time ago. But for Kyu Won's sake, I'm going to beg properly. You're right to do that. - Do you need my help? - No need. - Come on, I'll help you. - No need. - What... what's the matter? - I think I sprained my ankle. I said those weren't shoes someone of your age should be wearing. Who's at fault here? Who asked you to help me? Shoot. I can't put weight on my foot. Hold on, I'll support you. Hold on. I'm so tired! Where did Lee Kyu Won go? And who's this old lady? Dance practice is really very tiring. Sit down. I don't even have energy to talk. Let's go back earlier. Who said I wanted to talk to you? Sit down. Fine, let's rest a while. Does it hurt a lot? Don't move. I can't possibly go to your house to do this for you. If you do this before you sleep, it'll feel better tomorrow. Where did you learn this technique? Because of her work, my mother often needs to stand all day. You're such a filial son. It feels really good. 30,000 Won. - What? - I'm joking. Bring that side over here also. There are so many stars! The weather's really good, isn't it? I'm fine now. We're almost there. Let's just continue like this. What is it? Dad? How did the two of you come to be coming back together? - We bumped into each other in front. - Really? You're not going to squeeze me out the moment you're back, are you? Of course not. I've already lived so long with Grandfather, if anyone were to be squeezed out it would be Dad. Even though that's rather hurtful, but that's true as well. Of course. - Rest well. - Yes. Should we talk? Is it something I will be shocked about? Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. What is the relationship between you and Ahjumma? She was my first love. I've mentioned to you before... that there was once someone I was going to marry, right? That was... That's right. So, are you going to start anew? It's too late for that now. Compared to us, you're more important. There's nothing for you to worry about. - You heard, right? - I heard. That's why I care so much about you, I guess. I guess for me, too. If it weren't for us, they would probably have gotten back together, right? I would have a little sister called Lee Kyu Won. I told you before that I'm your noona by three months! Go to sleep. Tomorrow's One Day Teahouse will be very tiring. I know, but I can't sleep. Shall I sing to you? Now? When Mom came back late, and Jung Hyun made a fuss and refused to go to sleep, I often sang to her. Smile, don't be sad. It's okay, don't cry. This song I am singing right now, I hope it gives you small comfort. Smile, I'm always by your side. I love you, can you hear me? No matter what anyone says, The person who believes in you, I am with you. Smile Everything started coincidentally with us. At first I didn’t know this was going to be love. To think this was really love. My heart keeps on going thump-thump. You keep smiling without knowing, you started falling for me. You've fallen for me, fallen for me, you melted from my sweet love You've fallen for me, fallen for me, mesmerized by my charming gaze. See your eyes You've fallen for me See your eyes You've fallen for me Even when this moment passes I'll love you forever. Without even realizing, I also have fallen for you. Wine, wine, wine! Half-price sale! Kyu Won, here, take a break. Sure, Jae Wook. Thank you. Cheers! - How have you been recently? - Of course, I've been very well. You're becoming more and more handsome. What's so handsome about him? How are you becoming more and more handsome? Shall we take a photo? No, let's take a video. Anyone else? Both photos and videos are fine. Because of someone, our takings were very high. As long as you know. But you still went too far. But you said to increase the takings. I didn't ask you to use those methods to do so? What did I do? Taking photos with your arm around girls, leaning against them, you looked like you were enjoying yourself thoroughly. - Lee Kyu Won. - What? I think you're cute when you angry as well, that's why I'm letting it go. In the future, you're not allowed to laugh like that with other guys. - Jealous? - Yes! So don't do that anymore. You can't do that, either. I was also a little jealous earlier. Lee Kyu Won! And I can't hide you away either. Hiding me away won't diminish my charm in the slightest. Not at all? What? Are you angry? I'm now having some improper thoughts now. At this time, someone will definitely appear. So, go in first. See you tomorrow! Complimentary Tickets I'm not sure how I became the lead. Both of you will come watch, right? I'm not going. Why? Because it's the western devil's music? You said you're the lead. A production that has a first-timer as the lead is obviously not worth seeing. Grandfather, you're being overboard to your own granddaughter! That's right, Father, to my precious daughter. We'll definitely be there. Don't worry. You go then, I'm not going. Grandfather, if you don't come, my friends won't come to hear Grandfather's gugak life story. What? So you must come, understand? You must come, you must. Hello. You are disgusting, really disgusting. Unni, you know that the performance is tomorrow, right? I told them to have the car waiting earlier. These people! Where are you? Why aren't you bringing the car around? What are you doing? The snow is blowing. The beautiful Natasha loves me. The white horse over there, will also neigh melodiously in joy tonight. Let's go. Unni, I'll wait for you. Unni, I'll wait for you! Hee Joo. After the surgery, take a break from school for a year and go overseas. By the way, how did you meet a strange fellow like that? I'll be back after I settle the paperwork. Wait here. Unni, who are you? - What are you doing? - I've finally found my Natasha. Unni, let them see it all! That feels great! It's great, isn't it, unni? Try some. Take a nap, I'll sing to you. Unni, I believe in you. I'll wait for you to come back. You know that the performance is tomorrow, right? - It's Hee Joo unni. - Jun Hee, be my horse. Come over quickly! Where did she go? - Unni! - Why were you so slow?! Get on. - Let's go! - We're off! Very good, Lee Kyu Won. You're expression is quite good as well. Han Hee Joo. Why did you come? Didn't you say you were going to perform? You can't not have the female lead. Are you crazy? You abandoned the performance without a word, but now you're saying this here? The lead in our performance in Lee Kyu Won. That's what you think. If you say you want to act, I'll back down. What shall we do, Lee Kyu Won? You decide. You're just in time, Han Hee Joo. I'll leave it to you. This won't do. You have to start practicing. What? You need to practice. Aren't you sad? You worked so hard when Hee Joo wasn't around. It's okay. Like I said before, to me, being the lead is not the most important thing. Hee Joo is better than I am, so for the sake of the 100th anniversary performance, of course I have to step aside. - That's true. - And it's not my performance alone. Ki Young oppa has come to this point with much difficulty, and Sa Rang unni even gave up on her nose job. Everyone has made sacrifices. Honestly, I want to stand onstage too, but how could I just think about myself. I can't only fulfill my own wishes in a situation like this. Hee Joo might bring out more in your ending song than I can. - Good girl. - What? I said before I'm your noona by three months! If you want to cry, then cry in front of me. Even though as a teacher, I shouldn't say such things, you're a little hateful right now. It's okay. Because I also hate you. Can Lee Kyu Won go on stage like that? - What's wrong about it? - Do you really not know? Don't you know the dance is a beat slow? Am I wrong? I'll change it. - I'll coach her. - Why would you? Didn't you ask me to look after my understudy before the performance? I cannot tolerate my opposition. I can step in, can't I? That's wrong again. How many times have I said that it's not the upbeat? Aren't you going overboard? There's been no need for this up till now. You're so noisy. Start over again. - I don't want to. - Dance! No! Can you tell me you've tried your best? Yes, I can. When you've put in enough effort that you don't feel ashamed towards yourself, that is when you can say you've tried your best. I've never told myself that I've tried my best. I really envy you because you can say that. Let's try it again. Even though I can't say I've tried my best, but I want to be acknowledged by you. Fine. - Did you ask her to come here? - What? Do you think that the 100th Anniversary Performance will be revived like this? Absolutely not! So hand over Hee Joo now! I don't have any intention of asking you for help. Hee Joo came on her own accord as well. She ran off from the hospital. She can't sing! Her voice box is strained. If it worsens she won't be able to talk. Where's our Hee Joo? Very good, Lee Kyu Won. You've done well. See? It can be done if I coached. You rascal. You're moved by something like this? Why didn't you say anything? Rascal, I heard that if it worsens you might lose your voice forever? What does this performance matter? Why did you come here and not even undergo the surgery? Han Hee Joo, what is the meaning of this? What do you mean by that you'll lose your voice? You don't have any perception when it comes to Lee Kyu Won, so would she have been able to do it if I hadn't come? You people, really! Finally, it'll be tomorrow. Nervous? In school, poor students will definitely be burning the midnight oil the night before the exam, and then oversleep and miss the exam. But I'm not talking about others, I'm talking about you. Anyone who stays behind to practice today will be finished if I catch you. Go home earlier for dinner tonight, and rest well, - understand? - Yes! That's really all today. Dismissed! - Thank you! - Thanks for all the hard work! Dinner time! Lee Shin, Lee Kyu Won. Don't worry anymore, either. Rest well. Don't worry about me. I wanted to tell you to perform well. Don't just think about dating and go home early. Lee Kyu Won, because I was afraid you would be nervous, I've helped you till now. Then are you going to send me to my doorstep? Forget it. You must see her safely to her doorstep, okay? Unni. I'll send unni. - Let's go as well. - Okay. Seems like it was the right decision for me to participate in this musical. Me, too. I must not disappoint Hee Joo and the Director. I will do well. You definitely will. After all, who's girlfriend are you? Please be more serious at a time like this. I'm being serious. I wouldn't just like any girl. The most special, best-looking, one and only girl in the world is you. And you'll be like that tomorrow, too. Slowly. Pay attention there! Over there! Hurry, hurry! I won't forgive you if it's a disaster. It hasn't started yet, why are you saying such pessimistic things? That's right. You should have brought some food as encouragement. Are you still reluctant? I've lost. I forgot you were like this. After it's over, bring everyone out to celebrate. That's the senior I like. In the beginning, during the auditions, I thought I would be doing the makeup for Han Hee Joo. Who would have thought that it'd be you in the end? Poor girl. She's worked so hard all this time. She must be so sad. Unni. - Hold on a moment. - What is it? Where are you going all of a sudden? - Bo Woon. - Here. - Sa Rang. - Here. - Ki Young. - I won't run away anymore. - Kyu Won. - Yes, Sir. Lee Shin. Good. - Is everyone ready? - Yes! The moment is finally here. When we practiced, the promises we made to each other, and the promises we made to ourselves will be fulfilled in this moment. I... I believe in you! Let's go. Aren't you nervous today? But, what's with your expression? I'm a little nervous. What if the response to the ending song it not good? Don't worry, it'll be positive. No one will make mistakes during the performance, right? They won't. - I regret composing the ending song now. - Looks like you're really nervous. Come here. What? Didn't you teach me a refrain? If you are nervous on stage, then tell the audience... "You have fallen for me." Shin, fighting! Lee Kyu Won, fighting! What's going on? Didn't you say that Lee Kyu Won is the lead? Why did someone else come on? Father, watch patiently. I knew it'd be like this. - How could Kyu Won unni be the lead? - What did you say? Sorry. Shush! Han Hee Joo couldn't let go of her greed in the end. What is she doing on stage? She can't sing. Up till now there's not been any song, so at least it's been able to progress smoothly. What's going to happen to the song that appears in the fourth act? There's no problem with dancing, but Han Hee Joo's voice is completely incapable. Don't spout nonsense. Why are you so worked up? Better pray that all goes well. It's because I'm also worried about the performance. Really! Yes, smile so happiness will come Yes, smile so love can come into my embrace Even if all my dreams are like the stars in the sky Yes, get up; don't stay down Yes, get up, even if only to take one step a day Even if it's a slow pace, it's fine When tears form in my eyes When tears flow down my cheeks Cry out loud, even sadness will be frightened away When my heart is crumbling When my heart is in so much pain I laugh out loud, so hope can come find me When my heart is crumbling When my heart is in so much pain I laugh out loud, so hope can come find me Spread out your arms widely I might fall down, but that's not a failure But it's fine, I will dream again today Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad Main Translator: galen Spot Translator: fore Lyrics translations provided by: blue1004, lizzyd, Yuyu Timer: rheina07 Editor/QC: tofu Coordinators: mily2, ay_link
