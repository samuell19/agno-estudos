THE CIRCUS PRINCESS Ladies and gentlemen, you've come to the circus today, and you know exactly why. This is an excellent circus, unrivalled the world over. Flock to the ticket counter, you'll certainly get your money's worth. People, animals, sensations, only the very latest magic tricks, and our star attraction: The famous Mister X. Mister X is incomparable, daring, noble, elegant. Mister X is unsurpassable, The world-famous M ister X! Ringmaster, is M ister X that amazing? - We're from Moscow. Yes, M ister X is that amazing! He's the greatest. In Moscow, London, Paris, even in America, he has no equal. What sort of trick does he perform? - Trick? It's derring-do. Derring-do paired with true heroism. - Does he really wear a mask? Of course. He arrives in a mask and he leaves in a mask. That's how he prefers it. - Interesting. Mysterious. - See for yourself! Ladies and Gentlemen, you've come to the circus today, and you know exactly why. Mister X is simply excellent, without compare. Flock to the ticket counter. The show is about to begin. In our farewell performance you'll see the Tortellis from Rome and the famous Baranski Ballet. The Shah of Persia's five body guards. They've already saved the Shah's life three times. Miss Mabel Gibson, the talented English tightrope artist. Jin, Jen and Jan, the three sons of the dreaded Dr. Fu Manchu. The wild Lipizzaner stallions, presented by Baron Doc Schemansky. Our Indian elephants, presented by His Highness, the Maharajah of Tai Pur. And Tino, the giant baby. But for tonight's highlight, you'll see him... Does M ister X not introduce himself? His performance starts at 10:30 p.m. He enters the circus at 9:40 p.m. That's stipulated by his contract. In the first part you'll see Jin, Jen and Jan, The three sons of the infamous Chinese Dr. Fu Manchu. We've arrived, Princess. But Saskusin, what are you thinking, bringing me to the circus? I recall, when drinking champagne, Princess Fedora Palinska said: "I'd like to see Mister X." - Oh yes! And your wish, Fedora, will always be my command. You have an excellent memory. And you're very attentive. When will this attentiveness bear fruit? Saskusin, don't make things so hard for me. His Majesty the Tsar's orders are bad enough as it is. He lets me come from Paris and receives me, only to say: " Princess Palinska, the Palinski estates and mines which you inherited, and in which the crown holds substantial shares, require the strong hand of a man. Thus, it is my urgent imperial wish and order that you quickly remarry." - And have you chosen yet? There you see the agony of my choice. I love you! - Now, now, gentlemen. I can't marry all eight of you. And besides, is love really that wonderful? Whatever happens in the world, it's always the same old hat. Everything, oh everything for love. Whatever moves our heart, whatever stirs our senses, hatred or vows of fidelity: Only for love! Is love really that wonderful? Can't the world exist without it? Because every love brings sorrow, for someone already today, for someone else tomorrow. Is love really that wonderful when men turn our heads in such a way? Love letters and rendezvous, sweet kisses, moonlight... Dear friends, I say no. And now, gentlemen, I'm afraid I must... Thank you. After the show, then... That's Mister X. Splendid appearance, a la bonheur. Well gentlemen, how about it? Mister X starts at 10: 20 p.m. I'll pay for a few bottles of champagne. - How generous! Bravo! To Saskusin! Buenas noches, Señor X. Dead on time, Fedja. Your usual drink? - No, thank you. Fedja, what's wrong? - Nothing. Fedja, I know you. What's wrong? - Nothing. You risk your life every night. One mistake... That's many an artist's lot. If you won't tell us, we won't let you perform. I've just encountered a misery from my youth. And now, please leave me alone. And out again, into the limelight, out again, with a smile on my face... Even if life is often bitter and cold, show your art, because you're getting paid. You're only a juggler, a victim of fortune, show your artistry, show your tricks. If you do it well, your reward will be applause. If you fail, you'll be laughed off the stage. Here today, somewhere else tomorrow, what do I care! Here today, gone tomorrow, what do I care! If luck lends you a hand, grab it quick, comedian. Grab it quick, comedian, grab it! If you look at life through a champagne glass, it gleams like gold. A comely image awakes, for which you once yearned, two white arms, a red mouth, and suddenly, at the bottom of the glass, two fairy eyes glow, as beautiful as stars, two fairy eyes I once saw. I can't forget her shining look, I can't measure my lost luck. You dream of love, which I once dreamt, you dream of luck, which I once missed out on, you comely illusion of my lust, my pain, you sweet fairy tale - once upon a time... Excuse me. - Of course. What is it? - There are more visitors. The circus is sold out. It's his lmperial Highness, Prince Sergius. - The infamous prince? Vladimir, how long have I been waiting? - Ten hours, er... seconds. Is that how you receive Prince Sergius? - Yes, sir, er... no. If he doesn't appear at once, I'll buy the circus. I'm not used to waiting. Not even the Tsar himself makes me wait. How dare he, this miserable head of showmen? About time! Where shall I sit? - Yes, where shall His Highness sit? I'm sorry, I must disappoint you, we're full. Throw someone out, then! - But they've all paid. Offer him ten times as much if he leaves. Allez hop! Cesar wants to thank the ladies and gentlemen of the audience. The prince's box is almost empty. - There! I'm afraid this box is reserved for Princess Palinska. Very good! I'm here because of her. I must sit there! In a few days, she'll be sitting in my lap anyway. The only spare seat has been sold to a young foreigner. A loyal customer. - Give him a thousand roubles. Five thousand! I must have this seat. I'll try, Your lmperial Highness. Vladimir, how long has she been playing cat and mouse with me? Ever since she returned from Paris. - Am I a mouse? - A mouse? You're a prince of imperial breeding, er... blood. - Exactly. I'm telling you, the mask is a publicity stunt. If I imagine a man who conceals his face... What fate might be hidden behind it? - It's not ours. A glass of champagne, please. - Straight away, Mister X. Princess Palinska would like to meet you. - Princess Fedora Palinska? You know her? - I read the papers. I'm Mister X. And nothing else? - Nothing else, Madam. It's not customary for a gentleman to give his fantasy name and to conceal his face when he introduces himself to a lady. If he's a gentleman, that is... I'll leave it to Your Highness to judge that. I'll teach you how to behave in front of a lady. You won't perform tonight. - We'll see. Now, now, gentlemen, there's no need to get excited. You don't want to be involved in a fight with a man from the circus, do you? I won't fight with him. I'll just beat good manners into him. - Stop! Now, Gentlemen. You were guests of Count Saskusin. And Count Saskusin thanks you for your company. But now I'm asking you to leave us alone. Your Highness. Dearest Saskusin, would you do me a favour... Of course. - And leave us alone now? But Princess, I... - Please. If you'll see this as proof of my devotion, I'll gladly oblige. I apologise, it was my mistake. One of my horrible whims. Understandable female curiosity. Curiositas geminorum origo mundi est. Oh, you're well-educated. A flaw in my upbringing, Your Highness. That sounds rather embittered. I'm sorry, standing before you as an artist in grotesque attire, but nonetheless a man. What would you say if it came into this man's mind to confess his love to you? A man of whom I know nothing? Maybe this man knows something of you. You met him in Moscow, in Monte Carlo, in Paris. Maybe long ago you, without knowing, become the fate of this juggler who stands before you. That sounds almost like a novel. - Maybe it is a novel. One that starts like all novels: I love you. I love you, has that never moved your heart deeply? I love you, has your heart never resonated with this? I love you, a holy word. Whoever says it - comedian or lord - doesn't ask fate for permission. How peculiarly this word, coming from this mouth, touches my heart. Mysterious, a strange sound full of joy and pain. I love you, this word opens an ocean of happiness for you. It carries you far, so far away on its wings. Quietly, happiness floats by and the heavens open wide. Sweet, most delightful trembling, an experience long dreamt of. From the deepest depths of my heart, burning desires surface. Once in a life, everyone's hour comes and happiness knocks on the gate. Once in a life, everyone's hour comes and happiness knocks on the gate. Mister X... I... Excuse me, please. To you and to me, little Fedora. Toni! We thought you were gone! Toni is always where the circus is, and the little girls in their dresses. When I go to the circus in the evening, every now and then, and I see the sweet girls, oh, how it makes me feel. The little ones, with legs like marzipan, they're the most beautiful part of the show. Through the lorgnette, they look as sweet as sugar, rosy hands, pantaloon hems, everything's gorgeous. One of these circus fairies is my heart's desire. Oh, I must openly admit it, I love her much too much. The little girls in their dresses with their alluring ways. Their silken skirts, which they wear so jauntily, and underneath, a hint of lace. Oh how it rustles, how it whooshes as their skirts billow in the dance, then every bachelor says ho, oho, the little girls in their dresses. The little girls in their dresses with their alluring... Their silken skirts, which they wear so jauntily, and underneath, a hint of lace. Oh how it rustles, how it whooshes as their skirts billow in the dance, then every bachelor says ho, oho, the little girls in their... ...dresses. Finally! Miss Mabel Gibson! The only reason I go to the circus. Finally, I meet you! May I introduce myself: Toni. Well obviously my school English was only good for the teacher. Now I've had enough. They say: "The language of love is international." Dear Miss Mabel! When I look at you my teeth set on edge, my heart pounds, my wallet jumps. It makes me forget I'm just Toni, son of the Hotel Archduke Karl in Vienna, a poor devil in comparison to all your other suitors. No! You're from Vienna? Toni Schlumberger, 73 Nice Lantern Lane, 3rd backyard, 2nd floor, collar size 40. Liesel Burgstaller, 24 Panigl Lane, 3rd floor, Door No. 12, knock twice. A Wiener! Sorry, I couldn't help myself! - Never mind. Let your feelings out! - No way, I know that trick. Giving girls the eye and what do they end up with? Sweet little Mabel! Exactly that, a sweet little Mabel. No thanks, Mr. Limburger. Schlumberger. Do you know what? I'm taking you out for dinner. For champagne, for limburger. Oh, I'm so fond of you. He who wants to be fond of me has to marry to marry me first. So fondly as you would have me, I'm not so fond as that. That's why, Mr. Lim... - Schlum... ...berger, you can get lost. - But Mabel! Two hot Viennese hearts in cold Petersburg, does that not warm your heart? Oh, my cue! - But... Don't just stand there, else you'll get cold feet on top of the rejection. What does she care about the temperature of my feet, unless... ...unless she loves me! Finally, Princess. - You here? I'm taking the liberty of keeping you company. As an exercise, quasi. How am I to understand this? - The way it's intended. Fedora, you've been through so much... - Please, excuse me. I can't see anything. Poor chick. - Silly cow. Fedora, you've been through so much. Now, ladies and gentlemen, you're about to see a sensation: Dearest Fedora, you must finally enjoy your life. - Look, Mister X! Miss Gibson, I've been director of this circus for 30 years, but I've never... You're fired. - Yes, Mister Director. Thank you. You've been through so much. You should finally enjoy... I'd like to know who's hiding behind the mask. Fedora, I, the lmperial Prince Sergius, resolutely ask for your hand in marriage. Prince Sergius, you're joking. I can't believe it's the Tsar's intention to force me to marry an unloved and... ...over-mature man. And even if it were, he'd surely sympathise with me. You know, my next marriage should last the rest of my life, hopefully a long and happy life, Your Highness. That was clear. As you wish. Now, ladies and gentlemen, M ister X will perform the sensation of the night. A triple somersault from the top of the circus dome, landing on a horse's back. Mister X works without a safety rope and without a safety net. Even the largest insurance companies refuse to insure Mister X against accident. Because a faulty jump would in any case mean that M ister X... I'm furious! But don't worry, Fedora, Sergius isn't resentful, only vengeful. Vladimir, make it known I'll host a party at the castle tomorrow, in honour of the Princess. - Does she know? You're to tell her. - And if she doesn't come? Tell her I would like to apologise. - And if she still doesn't come? Then I'll send you to my grand aunt in Siberia. - At your command! And alert the officer corps of Petersburg, the ladies. In the middle of the night? - Tell them the Prussians are coming. They'll stand to attention then. - The ladies? And get me the director... and this M ister X. He'll play a little part in my comedy, a ridiculous one. And now, on your way. - On your way. At your command! Vodka! I'm thirsty. Plenty of vodka! I'm thirsty for revenge. Where's Mabel? - She fell off the rope. - Flown off. - Kicked out. Mabel. - Oh, Mister X. It's so very bad. Everything's over now. - But sweetie. Everyone has moments when they want to despair, and still... after a few years have passed, we often notice that what we cursed then as misfortune turned out to be the start of luck. Don't cry, darling. With eyes like yours, crying is a sin. Life's not always sunny, and every day can't be Sunday. Hence laugh and quickly cheer up. God knows what he's doing. He always wants the best for us silly people. Yes, he always arranges things right. You just shouldn't be impatient, things will turn out fine in the end. I remember a hussar lieutenant, Fedya Palinski, nephew and heir to one of the richest Princes in Russia. His life was a feast, one big wonderful ecstasy until... until one evening he saw a beautiful young lady in the theatre who fascinated him like none before. That same evening he went to his uncle, Prince Palinski, and said: "I'll marry this woman, at all costs." The young lieutenant was surprised to hear the old Prince confess that selfsame woman was the lady of his own heart and he was to marry her himself. The uncle disinherited the lieutenant and transferred him to a bleak garrison in the Ural Mountains. His career was destroyed. He took his leave and travelled the world. He joined the circus. You are that unfortunate, aren't you? How could I be unfortunate, now that the erstwhile lieutenant has seen the erstwhile lady again. Now that he's seen she's lonely, she's free, and that she's more desirable that ever. Very well, Your Highness. The ballet, the music, and at your signal, the clowns. It will be done. Oh, excuse me. - Excuse me. Hey, you! Porter! - Yes? You're the only one who can help me. Where is Mabel Gibson? I don't know the lady. - I thought as much. I still don't know her. - Don't be so stubborn. The one with... Oh, that one! The one with the... I don't know her either. There! Prince Cervius, or whatever the fool's called, gave me that in exchange for relinquishing my seat for 20 minutes. Now then. Where's Mabel? - I don't know. And you're still taking all the money? - Yes, because I'm that old fool Cervius. Now clear off, or I'll make cervelat sausage of you! You, this Cervius? Don't pull my leg, or else I'll put you through the mincer and sell you to the Eskimos as steak tartar. Your Highness, do you wish to be rid of this person? He's already said enough for two years' incarceration. - Your Hi? Who are you, anyway? - Toni, son of the Archduke Karl in Vienna. What? You're the son of my friend, the Archduke Karl? Blimey! You knew my father? I was always with him in Vienna. My goodness, the mischief we got up to! Why wasn't I told you were here? I'm travelling incognito. - I see. And this Mabel, she's the little intimate incognito, is she? The bunny, as Archduke Karl used to say? - Yes, the bunny. Don't worry, we'll find the bunny. And concerning my feast, of course you're invited, with as many Mabels as you wish. - If only I can find this one first! Splendid, these Austrian Archdukes, if they aim at a bunny, they're only happy when they get their shot. Your lmperial Highness! Mister X! There you are, my dear friend. And masked, as always. Please. Do tell, do you never remove the mask? On the contrary. I only wear it for about two hours a day. The two hours in which I live my second life, my circus life. I see. And the other one? In that, I'm a man of society. Then, I call myself Count Fedya Korossov or Prince Fedya Korossov, or whatever else comes to mind. And who knows that the count and the juggler are the same person? Only the count and the juggler. - Excellent. This is what gives my idea the right amount of Russian spice. Would you like to earn 10,000 roubles? - What makes you think that? Tomorrow, I'm hosting a party. I would like you to court a certain lady there. And who's this lady? - A young, immensely rich widow who's very keen to marry again. So how about it, are you game, Count Korossov, er, Prince Korossov? Yes, I'll introduce you to her as Prince Korossov. - To whom? Princess Fedora Palinska. I'm your man. - Bravo! Well then, Prince Korossov, to the beautiful Fedora Palinska. To Fedora Palinska. Prince Sergius must've been drunk. I give him a proper brush-off - a needle if you please - he leaves in a huff, and then his adjutant informs me that the Prince is hosting a party in my honour, and tonight. He's a gentleman of the old-school. I don't know. I never got that impression. Maybe he wants to show that he's not angry with you, that despite your rejection he still adores you. I think that's a very nice gesture. I don't know. It's the first nice gesture I've ever seen in him. Lf, in fact, it is a 'nice gesture'. I was on first-name terms with the father, so I'll be with the son. Come, let's drink to friendship. Well, I'm Sergius, but you may call me Sergi. Sergerl! - And you, dear brother, are... I'm Toni, but you can call me Anton, Karl-Anton. Well then, here's to first-name terms. - To you. No, no! First we have to drink to the twelve months! To every single one of them. So... January... Excuse me, sirs, have you seen my Toni? He's tall and slim, in a black and white jacket? Dearest, you don't want to be angling for a civilian? We're the pride of Russia. And each more dashing than the last. Gentlemen, stand to attention. Jesus, gentlemen. You're standing there like nutcrackers. Gentlemen, what does a hussar do when affronted by a woman? He hits back. The hussar is much-feared by women, that much is clear. The hussar is in love all year round. The dashing cavalier shall be insulted by no woman. He knows how to defend himself, gladly, everywhere. With devilish temerity he grabs the opportunity to tame her pride and end his anguish. The hussar's as wild as ever. That's why, girl, be careful, close your window tonight, girl, be careful when the moon smiles into your room. Danger looms today, the hussar's coming, he'll grab you in his strong arms, he knows no pity. Girl, be careful, don't leave your door open, girl, be careful, else it'll be all over for you. You laughed at me, made me furious. Girl, be careful tonight! Many thanks for your advice, gentlemen. December... The youth of today... no stamina. I've got myself in the right mood for the great occasion. If she doesn't turn up, my whole revenge plot is pointless. At your command! Where's Mister? - Shh! I mean Prince X, er, Mister Korrosov. Prince Korossov! No-one's seen him without his mask. Maybe he's here already, unrecognised, incognito, because he's not wearing a mask. Logical, no? Fool. No unknown person gets past the master of ceremonies without telling him his name and this M ister... - Shh! Prince Korossov is absolutely unknown here, because he doesn't even exist. Logical, no? Her Serene Highness, Princess Fedora Palinska. I thank you for your invitation and for the great tribute of being your guest of honour. I felt it was necessary. - His Highness, Prince Fedya Korossov. Princess, may I introduce to you Prince Korossov. Princess Fedora Palinska. I didn't know there's a Prince Korossov. The Prince spent a long time in China. The Boxer Rebellion. - How interesting. How many rounds did you box there, Your Highness? 55 days, if that's what you mean. - Even on Sundays? Never on a Sunday. Have we met before? In Paris, Cannes or Moscow? I travel a lot. - I also travel a lot. We've only just met and already we have something in common. Could I take the Princess off you for a moment? Please, go ahead. I think there was a spark between him and her. Has the letter arrived? - Here! Good. Seal it, take a young lieutenant, tell him I'll make him a captain if he runs for half an hour until he's panting, then gets on a horse, rides to Fedora's palace and hands over the letter with the words: "His Majesty the Tsar sends Princess Palinska this urgent dispatch." But why does he have to be panting? So the housekeeper deems the letter to be urgent. So urgent, she'll bring it over at once. But you wrote this letter. - Forget that immediately! At your command! And... ...if I do ten squats and then give Fedora the letter myself, will I be promoted, too? - You'll be beaten, because my revenge would be spoilt: Everybody would know the letter is from me. Does that mean the letter contains something really nasty? Something that will make this evening's protagonists well and truly shake. Strange. I'm meeting you the first time but I'm sure I've met you before. Maybe I'm the figment of your dreams. And what sort of dreams would they be? Dreams, where love plays a major role. Love. Love. Everything around me seems to revolve only around love. Does that surprise you? Don't you want to tell me how you see love? In the boudoir, at the feet of the most beautiful woman, a wonderful scent of such sweet flowers, a foreign perfume which sends greetings from afar, in the small parlour of the most beautiful woman. In the boudoir, subtle gold on a dark background, amorous music in a blue twilight. A caressing 'you' coming from hot, red lips, a sweet confession. That way, I think, it would be nice. My darling, my darling, has to be like you, walk like you, stand like you, turn like you, be as beautiful as you are. My darling has to be lovely, as lovely as you. Her cherry lips, so red and full, like yours, my darling. They'll miss us. Fate takes its course. Mabel, my sweet little Mabel. Where is my little Mabel? Jesus! Behind me, too! I'm surrounded and behind barred windows. - But Toni! Mabel! But Toni, you're as drunk as a lord. - Yes, I'm of noble birth. Oh Mabel, I could mabel you up out of love. Only once we're married. - I won't be hungry anymore then. It will all look different then. You'll put on 200 pounds a year and I'll become bald, because our 15 children will eat... You're talking rubbish! - What could be nicer than two people, hand in hand, driving in their Sunday best to the countryside. Spring sends sweet scents through the air, one clutches one's girl round the waist. May sends its messengers of love, red flowers are blooming in the garden. Longings swell in my heart, love moves in my chest. And it's light where I only saw darkness, hooray, spring has arrived. A messenger from the Tsar? - A lieutenant. He must've ridden like the devil, the poor chap. I offered him a glass of wine, but he declined. Bad news? - Excuse me. ...and there she sat. - And that really happened? Fedora, what happened? What, from the Tsar? My ladies, Her Highness's story also has a punch-line. I don't understand this. I'll have to read it again. "Concerned about the management of our joint estates, We have decided to have you married to a new husband. He's a worthy veteran who enjoys Our full confidence. You're urgently expected at court for the signing of the marriage contract, Nicholas II, Tsar of all Russians." Gosh, that's a blow. - A veteran. Why am I not allowed to marry the man I want? Do I have no right to love? But Fedora, why so dispirited? All is not lost yet. You only have to do the right thing quickly. - And what would that be? Get married tonight. Then you can step before the Tsar and say with a clear conscience: "Your Majesty, I'm sorry, your letter came too late. I'm already married." - To you, I guess? Now I understand. You've played an abominable game. No, no, Fedora, you misunderstand me. The dream is over for me. But seriously: Tonight, the cream of the crop of Petersburg is present. It'll be easy for you to find a partner for life, at least one who you'll find more agreeable than a veteran. You mean, I should... But... No buts. You'll marry tonight in full pomp and circumstance. There's a little chapel in the castle. There, my great grand aunt Catherine II solved many a problem for her court ladies with a nocturnal wedding. So? "Regrettably your letter came too late, Your Majesty. I'm already married." Not a bad idea. A brilliant idea, in fact. Yes, Fedora Palinska will get married tonight! But do you already know to whom? I hope I'm not interrupting. - On the contrary, Prince Korossov. Would you mind attending to the Princess for a moment? I have to arrange a few things. I'll never forget that, Prince. - But Fedora! How can I be of service, my dear Prince? What happened? You received a letter, ran off, and now you're as jolly as a... - as a school girl. Read this. And that makes you happy? - First, it made me sad. But then Prince Sergius gave me the idea of being married already. But you're not! - I will be soon. In an hour. I'll get married tonight. I'll plunge into marriage like... ...like M ister X plunges onto his horse and rides away. And who's the lucky one playing the horse? A charming person. From the first moment, I fell mortally in love with him. Only, he doesn't know it yet, that he'll soon be my husband. And who is it? That's my secret. - An open secret. It's Prince Sergius, who's currently arranging the wedding, right? Yes, he's arranging the wedding. Fedora, the man you're about to marry isn't right for you. He's perfect for me. - He's dreadfully dislikeable. He's very likeable. - He's a philanderer. He'll be faithful to me. - Do you even know if he loves you? No, I don't know that yet. - What, you don't know that yet? Not yet. But be consoled, I'll know in a moment. This is madness, it's insane! Sheer suicide! This man doesn't love you. He'll ruin you. You'll be the most unloved woman in the world. If he remains the way he is now, I find that hard to believe. How are you planning to tell him that you want to marry him? Will you command him like a sergeant: "Into marriage march!" No. I'll take his dear, silly head like this, you see. Then I'll look deep into his eyes, like this, you see. And then I'll kiss him until he understands. Fedora, you're making me the happiest man in the world. Sweetest of all women, if you could see into my heart, you could read there what you've meant to me since the moment our eyes first met. Sweetheart, once I'm yours I'll show you happiness. A thousand songs are sounding, all the angels are singing, the heavenly violins sweetly resound around us. An exultant concert, we're in love and overjoyed. A song of happiness like I've never heard before. I and you, you and I, put your arm around me. Hold me tight, my heart pressed against yours. The world around us fades away when happiness surrounds us, when the first kiss brings us bliss. You and I, I and you, hold me tight forever. I'm yours and you're mine, that's how it shall be. Until the stars fade, forever and ever, the two of us my darling, just you and I. Just you and I. But it won't work. What won't work? - I can't walk down the aisle with you without... - What? Without having taken care of something first. - What's that, Fedya? It's nothing. Only a small act of courtesy. At your command! - Has the priest been woken? The organist pulled from his bed? The champagne chilled? The priest's been chilled, the champagne's been pulled from his bed, the organist... at your command! Have the circus folk gathered? - They're waiting in the green hall. Now inform our guests. - At your command! This is outrageous! Oh Your Highness, Sergius, Sergerli... I'll stand for the consequences. Don't exaggerate. An Archduke Karl and... Yes, and. I'll marry Mabel. Toni! - I prefer her over the daughter of the Roman Emperor, who my mother has chosen for me, and the daughter of the King of England, as my godfather would have it. What, you're rejecting such good catches? Well, you Austrians have always had a penchant for the bourgeois. You can marry her tonight, if you like. In less than an hour, Princess Palinska will marry Prince Korossov. Let's make it a double wedding. - That's... If there's a wedding at all. - We're in the way. Your Highness, I request an explanation. - Of course, dear friend. You asked me to court Fedora Palinska in the role of Prince Korossov. - And you did that well. You're a circus artist of some calibre. - Then along came the Tsar's dispatch. Fedora Palinska opted for me. That was my fervent wish. - You tipped the odds in your favour. Please! - I deem the dispatch to be a fake. You faked it! Dear friend, your imagination is playing tricks on you. The dispatch is genuine. Don't worry about it. Marry Fedora. Have you ever even dreamt of such a fortune? I don't see through you, Your Highness, but I'm warning you. Maybe your game will take a different turn from the one you favour. It already took the turn I favour most. And thus I ask you, Lisa Burgstaller, called Mabel Gibson, and you, Karl-Anton, Archduke of Austria, You have to tell him. - Well then... Discard the Archduke and simply write Schlumberger. But you're the son of my friend, Archduke Karl. From the Hotel "Archduke Karl". - And the daughter of the Roman Emperor? From the Hotel "Roman Emperor". So then, do you vow to live a life together in faithfulness and truthfulness until death do you part? Yes! And you, Princess Fedora Palinska and Prince Fedya Korossov, do you vow to live a life together in faithfulness and truthfulness until death do you part? Yes. Yes. Then I declare you husband and wife. A wedding, what splendour, a wedding at midnight. Comely bride, you're married, married for life. Wedding dance, wedding punch, Russian bride, hear our wish: May happiness surround you many a year, now and forever. Today, the bell tolled for me too, finally the day arrived for me which I longed for lovingly with burning-hot kisses. Quietly, happiness floats past and the heavens open wide, sweetest, most delightful trembling, long dreamt of experience. From the deepest depths of my heart, burning desires surface. Once in a life, everyone's hour comes and happiness knocks on the gate. Prince Sergius orders you to leave the party immediately or else he'll have you beaten out of Petersburg. - What? Your Highness, could you please explain? With pleasure, Your Highness. I sent for the circus folk because they're now your life. I fear for your sanity. - On the contrary. I seldom felt as sane as I do now. I owe you these 10,000 roubles for successfully courting the Princess. What does that mean, Fedya? Please, tell me the truth. Let me tell you the truth. You didn't marry Prince Korossov, he doesn't even exist. Who is he then? Mister X! You're M ister X? - Yes, Fedora. I married someone from the circus. - Indeed, Fedora. I've turned you into a circus princess. Circus princess? This can't be happening. So it was just revenge, all along. I should have known. Why did you do it? - I owed it to my health. Ladies and Gentlemen. And you, my husband? Tell me none of this is true. It is true. - Fedya, why did you do this to me? Fedora, don't ask me that now. I told Prince Sergius that his plot might end in a different way than he believed. He couldn't know that I love you, that I love you, Fedora. - You love me! You, who allowed himself to be made the willing tool of a cheap plot. It will all be cleared up. Now we're husband and wife. Husband and wife... Thank you for a husband who gets married under a false name. It was a good performance, Mister X. There are still a few things which need resolving, Mister X. You mortally insulted the Princess. You misappropriated a title. In this uniform, which you're wrongfully wearing, you've offended the honour of the officers of the lmperial Hussars. Choose! Gentlemen, I did nothing to which I wasn't entitled. I wear this uniform because I'm an officer of the hussars. I married Fedora Palinska because I've been in love with her for many years. I'm Prince Fedya. Korossov is my mother's name. It's less conspicuous than that of my late uncle, Prince Palinski. That means you're... You should run the gauntlet for such a story. Well? - As you please. Stop! I remember Fedya Palinski. He was the talk of the town in the cadet corps. Prince Fedya was an excellent shooter. He could hit three champagne glasses with three shots from the hip. That's long ago. But if you wish... Bravo! Your Highness, comrade, we beg your forgiveness. You must feel awful. - That passes. What about Princess Fedora? - I've lost her a second time. What will you do now? - What's left for me to do? Out again, into the limelight, out again, with a smile on my face. Even if life is often bitter and cold, show your art, because you're getting paid. You're only a juggler, a victim of fortune, show your artistry, show your tricks. If you do it well, your reward will be applause. If you fail, you'll be laughed off the stage. If someone steals the harlequin's small piece of happiness, who will question it, to whom can he complain? Go to your circus tent, don't mess around, mask your face and don't think about it, mask your heart, and forget what's been done to you. You dream of love, which once I dreamt, you dream of luck, which once I missed out on, you comely illusion of my lust, of my pain, you sweet fairy tale - once upon a time... What would you say if it came into this man's head to confess his love to you? A man of whom I know nothing? Maybe long ago, without knowing, you become the fate of this juggler who stands before you. I'll plunge into marriage like... ...like M ister X plunges onto his horse and rides away. Indeed Fedora, I turned you into a circus princess. I owed it to my health. Your Highness, you're brooding too much. It's over. Prince Palinski is gone. I know, but... He must know that I regret leaving him and that I didn't intend to insult him. Yes, that I love him. When I imagine him agonising about it, maybe he blames himself. His plunge onto the horse... If he fell... I think, I could never forgive myself... Your Highness. - Director Baranski, you here? Please excuse my intrusion, but I specially travelled to you. It's about Prince Palinski, Mister X, your husband. What about him? Is there bad news? Ever since this unfortunate episode he's utterly changed. He never was very talkative, but... What's the matter with him? - His jumps are becoming more reckless. Not only that, he's also decided to jump onto a galloping horse from now on. No! - Your Highness, I've been a circus director for thirty years, I know that this jump will be the death of him. When's he going to risk this jump? At the farewell performance in Vienna. Mister Pelican! The boss has asked for you three times already. Only three times? Today is my fortieth anniversary in service, today I'll take my time. Oh, it's Toni. - Greetings, Pelican. Go to the lady in Number 16 and deliver some cream cake. Number 16? I'm on my way. I enjoy going to Number 16 because the lady in Number 16 isn't a lady but every man's dream. - The boy has potential. Pray tell, how's my mother's mood today? At the moment she's supporting the local porcelain industry. She's grumpy again. Today of all days, when I was about to confess everything. Oh Pelican, if only you knew. The lady in Number 16... I know, M iss Mabel Gibson. The lady who arrived on the same day as you. A magnificent person. I'm a man of the world, concerning women. Those eyes, two fairy tales! Worse. - You're in love with her? Worse. - You want to marry her? Even worse. - There's nothing worse than marrying. I'm already married. - Put it away, quickly. I married her in secret, Russian-Paradox. Pelican, what shall we do now? - Now, my feet are hurting. Unfortunately, Mabel has a dark secret. A dark secret? Yes, bad news travels fast. - She can ride fast, too. She's from the circus. - That'll really delight your mother. Mister To... Mister Toni sends the cake. He should put his cake on ice. I don't want his cakes, I want him! The rascal! What sort of mess is this? The guests in private room Number 5 have been ringing for a full half an hour. And the tables in the salon have not been cleared. Where's Toni hanging about again? - I'll go to Number 16 and you... dearest Pelican, Pelicanly, - Ugh, disgusting. You'll tell my mother the whole truth. Thank you! Toni! He is but young. You only tell the truth if you run out of... Mister Pelican, the boss hasn't been this upset in a long time! Dear God, please help me. This isn't a hotel anymore, it's a... True. - What's true? - Everything. Everything M rs. Boss says. When someone says: "That's not true", the right of termination applies. I'm asking myself why I didn't fire you 20 years ago. I'm asking myself the same. She's so lovely today, so lovely. Watch, she'll congratulate me for my anniversary in service next. My dear, good old Pelican. - What did I tell you? Yes, M rs. Boss. - You've been with us for such a long time. - Forty years. And then you let this chaos occur? Congratulations! Thank you, Mrs. Boss. Pelican, you're becoming more and more stupid. - I'm getting... What was that? - '"Pelican, you're becoming more and more stupid.'" And what about you two? Nothing? No. - Well then! - Forward march! - Yes. That you said that in front of the others, about becoming stupid... Careful, the ash is ruining the floor. ...how am I to understand this? You can understand it how you like. You're not your old self anymore. What you probably mean is, I'm not my young self anymore. But that was forty years ago. Back then, I was a young and beautiful man. Well, you weren't ever beautiful, really. But delightful. When I carried my first glasses, I walked with straight feet. They were never straight! - Straighter than today. And you were a lovely little blonde girl. You didn't wear much. A bib at the front and a button at the back. If you come over all sentimental now, I can't be angry with you! - You shouldn't be, anyway. When nobody was looking, I undid the button and quietly gave you a little slap. You shouldn't say that! - But that's what I did. And then you blossomed like a flower. Every year you became a year older, and when you were 17... Oh do you remember, Pelican? I was so in love with the young Baron Burgstaller. Lieutenant. Allow me, M rs. Boss? He was with the dragoons. My heart belonged to him! - With yellow lapels. What a character. - And the little golden tassel. His parents were against the marriage, because I was a landlord's daughter, so I took M r. Schlumberger. Any port in a storm. Sorry. He wasn't the worst. It was hard in the beginning, but then there was Toni. He arrived very soon. Where is the scallywag, anyway? Mr. Scallywag is in Number 16. - Again? I don't want to be the lady of Number 16 any more. I can't sit here forever, eating cream cake, just because you're afraid of your mother. If you don't introduce me to her today, I'm going to Budapest with the circus tonight. Very well! If you walk out on me, I'm going to Budapest straight away. They all love me there. There, all the men shout: Jo estét galaom, akezed csókolom. Szervusz kis angyalom, szervusz babám! If you walk out on me, I'm going to Budapest straight away. I feel so good there, it's my sport. I was in London, Paris and Vienna, I also know Berlin and even Varaždin, and yet it's beyond words how much I enjoy going to Pest. Darling, you won't do that to yourself, without me. What will you do then? Without me, you surely love me, and I love you, too. You'll yearn for me every day, you'll bathe in tears. Is that so, my darling? What do you think? Do you really think I need you? If you walk out on me, I'm going to Budapest straight away. They all love me there. There, all the men shout: Jo estét galabom, kezed csókolom. Szervusz kis angyalom, szervusz babám! If you walk out on me, I'm going to Budapest straight away. I feel so good there, it's my sport. I was in London, Paris and Vienna, I also know Berlin and even Varaždin, and yet it's beyond words how much I enjoy going to Pest. Oh little Mabel! Just you wait, today I'm going to surpass myself. Is your mother really such an old bint, such a dragon? A dragon? That's a... - Dinosaur! - That's right! I think I've seen enough, but maybe you could explain things to me? It's like this, Mrs. Boss. Even in the bible it says... The door... Shut the door. Even... Where were we? The bible! Even in the bible it says: Love each other and procreate daily, possibly, hourly. I would like to be informed by my son. Yes, your son. - Well... Well, M um, I brought something for myself from Russia. - What? A packet of tea. Pelican, I can't. I don't dare. You tell her. - I'll do it frankly, as quick as a shot. Mrs. Boss. Your Excellency, Your Reverence... - Yes, please? Please... I don't dare, either. But I do. Dear Mrs. Schlumberger, your Toni and I, we love each other. - What? I'm shocked. What does your husband say about this? He completely agrees. - We're all agreed. He must be quite a fool! And even though I was with the circus... With the Cir... ...cus. - Yes, with the circus. ...I nonetheless have a little blue blood in me, too. My father is Baron Burgstaller of the dragoons. With yellow lapels and the little golden tassel. Baron Burgstaller? Franzl? Do you know him? - Jesus! I can't believe it! You almost became my daughter! - That's not important. She'll be your daughter-in-law instead. Don't tell me you're as good as engaged! No, as bad as married. - Yes, Mum. We're husband and wife. - Now there should be an earthquake. Well, how badly you know me. I don't mind that you like each other. Two people like you surely must like each other. I didn't get Mr. Burgstaller, I got Toni instead. Mr. Burgstaller got Mabel, now Toni gets Mabel, and I get Mabel, and everyone gets everyone! And if it's a boy, he'll become a dragoon. With yellow lapels and a very tiny golden tassel. Madame? - I made a reservation over the phone. Princess Palinska. How kind of you to grace us with your presence. You'll reside in the Royal Suite. - Very kind, but I have different plans. Plans for which I'm counting on your discretion and your help. I'm at your service, Madame. - Is Mister X present? - Yes. I need to talk to him. - Impossible. He'll only receive Director Baranski. - Oh yes, it's his last show tonight. Tonight, he'll dare... - Where is he now? - In his suite. What does he do before the show? - He dines. Alone? - He always dines alone. - Good. Could you organise me a dress? - A dress? - A black dress. I'm sticking to it. I'm going to risk the jump. Fedya, you're unique worldwide, you're successful beyond imagination. If your jump is successful, today, tomorrow, every day, you again will be successful and unique, but what if you fail? - Then I'll be just one of the unnamed. Give up this idea! - No, I need to do this jump. I can't see any other way to regain my self-respect. Now, please leave me alone, I need to eat something. Well, as you please. - Come in. Yes, but... - Anything else, Baranski? No, no. Please, where shall I serve this? - On the small table, as usual. You've broken something. - I'm sorry! - Don't mention it. It means good luck... - Yes it's me, Fedya. - Bravo. In the past, I wore the mask, now you're dressing up as a chambermaid. You're making progress. - Fedya, I... Save your explanations. - But Fedya, listen to me. You told me everything. It was the night of our wedding. You told me your opinion in no uncertain terms. I didn't know who you were. You learned I was just a juggler. It was only later I learned you're Prince Palinski. And that changed your feelings? You have a remarkable character, Your Serene Highness. Fedya, do you not feel anything? I love you, has that never moved your heart? I love you, has your heart never resonated with this? I love you, a holy word, whoever says it, comedian or lord, doesn't ask fate for permission. How peculiarly this word, coming from this mouth, touches my heart. Mysterious, a strange sound once full of joy and pain. I love you, this word opens an ocean of happiness to you. It carries me far, so far away on its wings. You're mistaken, Your Serene Highness. It's too late. I've lost too many things in connection with your name. All right, I'm leaving. And you'll never hear from me again. But promise me one thing: Don't perform the jump. Fedora. - Yes? I thank you for your sympathy. But I have to risk the jump. It's the only way to forget you. Allez hop! And up! Yes, good. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the famous Mister X! And now, M ister X won't simply perform the sensation of tonight's show, Mister X will show you, for the first time, a hitherto unknown and believed to be impossible worldwide sensation. Performing a triple somersault from the top of the circus dome, he'll jump onto the back of a galloping horse. He works without a safety rope and without a safety net. Even the largest insurance companies refuse to insure Mister X against accident. Because a faulty jump would in any case mean, that Mister X... You couldn't prevent it, either? - No, I only broke things. Fedora, be careful, otherwise you might really end up as a circus princess. Your circus princess. Here today, somewhere else tomorrow, what do I care! Here today, gone tomorrow, what do I care! If luck lends you a hand, quick, grab it, comedian, quick, grab it, comedian, grab it! Huzza, the night awakes. Hey, the night awakes. Huzza, the night awakes, beaming with splendid lights. Huzza, the night's arrived, your happiness is drawing near. Happiness comes round the corner, the cork hits the ceiling. And what lies there were suddenly become clear. Huzza, the night's arrived. If you look at life through a champagne glass, it gleams like gold. A comely image awakes, for which you once yearned, two white arms, a red mouth, and suddenly, at the bottom of the glass, two fairy eyes glow, as beautiful as stars, two fairy eyes I once saw. I can't forget her shining look, I can't measure my lost luck. You dream of love, which I once dreamt, you dream of luck, which I once missed out on. You comely illusion of my lust, of my pain, you sweet fairy tale - once upon a time...
