What the hell? Come on! Hey! Right there. Hey, drive it or fuck it, pops! Bring a stretcher, he's still alive. Let's go! According to the truck drivers, the house was flipped off the rig in the middle of the highway. Guy never knew what hit him. All right, that's it. Keep it coming, keep it coming, come on. Easy, easy. Okay, here we go, back up, back up, back up. Get them outta here! Still alive? His vital signs aren't bad, but with these head injuries, I don't know. Probably never wake up, right? Hey! Geez, what is this? Hey, what the hell are you doing, man? Get out. - I said get out. - Okay, okay, okay. It's gotta be like this. Hey, come on, come on, man. Look, look at the tooth, man. Last time, you broke my damn jaw. - No, it's gotta be this way. - Come on, man. Son of a bitch. Hello? John? No, is he there? It's Dr. Larson. Oh, no, he's at the lab. Did you try him there? I tried. The switchboard was closed. ls it news about his mother? Yes, good news. She's regained consciousness. Oh, thank God. Come on up here soon, Sharon. She could lapse again. Oh no, don't even say that. I'll, look, I'll have him there in 20 minutes, all right? - Good. - Okay. Hart, you better be getting home. It's damn near 2:00 a.m. You sure you don't need any help, Dr. Hollins? Do you know what it is? No. Take a look. This is a class of renegade proteins called prions. Prions. Hopefully they'll lead us to the cause of Alzheimer's and other diseases. John? Dr. Larson just called, your mother came out of it. He wants you there right away. How long ago did he call? 20 minutes ago. Did he say what kind of shape she was in? No, he just said get there as soon as possible. All right. We can take my car, I left it by the front entrance. Great, that'll save time. They moved her from intensive care? Dr. Larson said we should ask for him at the desk, he wants to talk with you. John. Dr. Lloyd, good news. My mother's regained consciousness. Oh, good. That's great. Bury it. Who is that man? Dr. Phillip Lloyd. He looks like a well poisoner. Well, he did work in germ warfare research for awhile. Uh huh. He won every prize there was except for the Nobel. He'll probably win that for what he's working on now. You don't know? Nobody does. When you get to his level, you don't have to talk to people about your secret projects. He worked with my mother for a couple of years before she retired. I heard they had some kind of a falling out. You've been great through this whole thing. Don't let her talk too much. And if she starts rambling- I never ramble. Hello. All the times I told you I never want to be kept alive by extraordinary means. Why didn't you pull the plug? What is this, a complaint? It wasn't just an accident, was it? No, you had a heart attack. You blacked out. - Did I hurt anybody? - No, just yourself. So what have you been doing all this time? Sitting here waiting for my eyes to open? Round the clock at first. Sharon was here for a good part of that. You two didn't get married while I was out of it, did you? Wouldn't you love that? So is there anything I can do for you? You'll have to clean up for me. Go up there and burn everything. Burn everything? Make sure you find the data relating to hemocyanin. It was promising but the side effects are too dangerous. What is it? Mother, what? - What, Mother? - I just remembered. Oh, dear God, that day. That day I went for a drive to find the courage to do what I had to do. Oh dear God, he's still living, he's still alive. Who's alive? Look, you must go up there this instant, at once, today, and end the experiment. Burn the journals, the Anthony journals, burn them. And don't, don't be tempted, John. If you continue the experiment, who knows what he might become? Oh dear God, I never meant for it to go this far. Calm down, I don't understand what you're saying. Tell me what you're saying. Anthony! Everything is going to be fine. Who is Anthony? Your brother! Quickly now, quickly. Dr. Lloyd. The hell are you doing here? I thought I told you never to come here. Good morning, Dr. Lloyd. But now that you're here, you might as well come in. Come on. What's the matter, didn't Jackson reimburse you? I need more. Twice as much. You haven't fallen in love with chemicals, have you, Harry? Hey, that's my business. All right, that's your business. Okay, tell you what I'll do. I'll give you $100 more. You're not hearing me, Dr. Lloyd. Now I don't like to threaten the people I work with, but if that's what it takes. Come with me, I'll pay you what I owe you. Come on. I'm a leader, I fashion people. I not only change minds and bodies, I change the course of human evolution as well. This where you keep all those braindead I bring you? This is it. Tell me something. You still afraid of me? Maybe you think I could get you discredited with what I know? Discredited? My friend, you could get me arrested. You wouldn't betray a friend, would you? Sure. Good thing you're not my friend. One thing I learned from my daddy, never cross a guy who's got the eyes of a killer. You think I've got the eyes of a killer? Yeah, you do. Hey! Hey, Lloyd, come on! Open up the goddamn door, Lloyd, come on! Shit. Can I get out through here? Dr. Lloyd, please, please let me out, I won't tell anyone! Please! No, no! John. How's your mother? Resting, under sedation. How did you find out about it, Hart? Oh, no, I called your house this morning to say I wasn't coming in and Sharon told me. Then why are you here? Just one of the team, I guess. Any chance I can have the weekend off? Not this weekend, no. It's my parents' 35th wedding anniversary. We'll see. I knew that'd get him. Thanks a lot. Hi, Brad. Good morning. Listen, I'm trying to quit smoking today, so therefore I'm not speaking to anybody. Sorry about that. Especially you, Hart. Oh, more good news about your mother, I hope. She's doing very well, thank you. Dr. Lloyd, you've known my mother a very long time. Yeah, I would say I knew her a little bit. I danced at her wedding. I wish I had some relatives that I could ask about this, but I don't. Why don't you sit down? Thank you. You feel a little awkward talking about this? Not at all. Did she have any other children? Children? No, she never mentioned anything about a child. I hadn't heard anything about it until last night. She mentioned someone named Anthony. My brother. Did you know of him? Brother? I knew your mother on and off for many years but she never mentioned another child. Did she say anything else? No. Thank you for your time. Are you going back to the hospital? No. I promised her that I go up to the house to clean up some of her unresolved experiments. I'll take some of the team with me, whoever I can pry loose. Well, wait a minute. Home experiments? Amanda was never one to give up, was she? I mean, she'd hang on, boy, she'd hang on to a dream or a nightmare. You take care of yourself. Yeah. Anthony. Tell me about Anthony. I mean, how many of them were there? Anthony Two, Anthony Three? How many were there before you felt morally obligated to terminate? There were four. Four. And that was John's brother? What are you talking about? You see, your son and I, well, we're developing quite a relationship. In fact, I think when he comes back from your house, he's going to tell me everything about Anthony. I'll see to it that he never so much as looks at you again. I'll tell him all about you and your sick dreams. He won't give you the time of day. Well... let me tell you something, Amanda. I think you had better tell me about Anthony. Before I go, I'm going to put a stop to you, Phillip. I should have done it years ago. Where are you going to go, Amanda? You going to go to your... You going to go to your just awards? Are you? Now, now, now, now, no, no. Why don't you tell me? No, you tell me. You tell me where your notebooks are, tell me where the records of the experiments are, tell me what you did, tell me how you did it. I want to finish your experiments. I'm going to do everything in my power to finish you. I'm afraid, my darling, you don't have much power left. By her Christian faith, she was united with all your believing peoples. Now in love and mercy, give her a place with your angels and saints. Grant this through Christ our Lord. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. I'd like a minute alone. You're her son. My condolences. Thank you. I'm Melissa Leftridge. I tried to get in touch with your mother. That's when I found out she was in hospital. Did you know her? No, not personally, but she was my inspiration all through my years at Oxford, then at the Cavendish lab. And I was hoping at last, I'd get the chance to meet and thank her. She'd sent me a letter full of praise and encouragement. I attempted my paper on hemocyanin. Have you been working with hemocyanin? Yes, I was experimenting with it at the Cavendish. I had a theory that it might help prevent bone disintegration in space. She shared my theory. You can imagine how that made me feel. I rushed out and bought every book she'd ever written and got copies of all her journals and memorized, not every word of course, just every thought. Have you read any journals about Anthony? No, I haven't. Could I? Are they available yet? No, not yet. Thank you, Miss Leftridge. I'm glad that my mother was of help to you. I'm sorry you never got to meet her in person. My sympathies. Miss Leftridge? Melissa. Who was that? Melissa Leftridge. - Oh, you know her? - No, but we'll all get to. She's coming up to the house this weekend. With us this weekend? Go on, Duke. A wonderful house. How long since you've been here? A long time. Five or six years. - Well, why so long? - I don't know. She liked her privacy. The refrigerator's down. Guess the power's out. Didn't you pay the utilities while she was in the hospital? No, look, I'd better call. Maybe they can get here before dark. John. It's been disconnected. Well, maybe I can get the lights on. There used to be a generator back here. Look. Oh, the freezer must be leaking. The floorboards are all rotten. Something awful's down there. You smell it? God only knows how long this has been without any power. Maybe we better go check it out. I want to look at the house with you. When I was in grad school, she'd come down for a weekend every month or so and we'd go out to these great restaurants and go for these long walks, talk about everything under the sun except science. Your room? Want to see it? Are you serious? Well, she told me she was going to continue with her work... but not to this extent. I'm glad I brought the group up. This could take a week to organize. Well, I'm sure Miss Leftridge will be a big help. Hey, I brought her up here because she knows more about my mother's work than any of us. Nobody else seemed to mind. I don't mind either. The only thing upsetting me is this isn't your boyhood room anymore. Melissa. I didn't hear the doorbell ring. You forgot to lock the door last night. I just walked in. I hope you don't mind. No. No, not at all. I decided not to wait for the others. I wanted to start work early. In the middle of the night? John, what do you think this is? It's a schematic. For what, do you know? Some kind of an incubation device. I can't seem to find the... Hello. Hi, I'm Melissa. I was just going to go make some coffee. Great. Would you like some coffee? No, not for me, thank you. All right. All right, now watch this. I want a cigarette, I don't have a match, right? All I have to do is press this little button right here. The cigarette will pop out and light itself. Are you ready? Yes. Isn't that neat? It didn't work. Well, it's not supposed to, it's for people who are trying to quit smoking. Look at that dork. Why is he wasting his time? I mean, doesn't he know she's not going to be up there with us? Wouldn't it ever occur to you to be nice to someone you weren't hoping to sleep with? I'm awfully nice to you, aren't I? Anyway, what makes you so sure he's not hoping to? Because he's still hung up on me. I thought you said you never have relationships with people you work with. Well, it wasn't supposed to be a relationship. I mean, it was supposed to be a weekend or two of fun and games and he got serious. I didn't plan on hurting him. Why are you so down on him? Because everybody's so high on him. Brad, you're a post doc. Grow up. Be really careful with that. It's my parents' 35th anniversary present. Didn't know the 35th was watermelon. Excuse me, Sharon. John wants some tea, so I was wondering-- I can't, I'm busy. I didn't mean for you to get it. I'm going to. I was going to ask if you'd like a cup. Oh, I... No, thank you. All right. - Hey, where have you guys been? - Hi. Had to pick up a watermelon. I'm sorry. No, no, it was never the watermelon. Here, let me help you with that stuff. Melissa? This is Brad Baxter. Melissa Leftridge. Hello. How do you do? You still want that tea, John? No, thank you. This place is amazing. Your mother must've been a real power tool. I mean, the whole house is fantastic, with the possible exception of the basement. Now what is down there? It's just a laundry room. I remember sliding down one of the chutes from the bathroom. What is this? I love this. This is a lullaby my mother used to play when I'd get rambunctious. It always seemed to calm me down. Why don't you make a couple of extra copies? Hart. Hi, Dr. Hollins. Everyone, I'd like you to meet Melissa. This is Hart. Hello. Nell, Cindy. - Nice to meet you. - Okay, Hart, Cindy, I want you to start organizing the research material. Anything that has to do with the experiments, the research data, and the sources, and anything you find on the hemocyanin, I want you to take directly to Melissa. She'll be working on that exclusively from now on. Brad, I want you to reconstruct any of my mother's unresolved experiments and just see if you can nail something down. I'm going to start looking for information on Anthony. No sign of him yet? Maybe there are clues in the journals she mentioned but I haven't been able to find them either. I cannot believe he ran away. Duke? He's just out exploring, he'll find his way back. What about you? Any luck with the journals? Maybe she destroyed them before she took that ride and forgot about it. Do you want to help me with this stuff? I'd rather take a nice long bath before dinner. Wouldn't you? Wait. I just made a vow that from this moment on, I will never kiss anybody uglier than you. He's so cute. Look at his bathing suit. - God. - Oh, wait, look. This is John's room before it was the lab. You're kidding. I think it looks better as a lab. Is there anything better to eat than stale donuts? I bought you guys cantaloupes. Always complaining, men. Don't! That's my folks'. I said you could have cantaloupes. Hart, can you put it in my car? Sure. Oh, for crying out loud. Okay. Bye. You certainly take your marine research seriously. Did you sleep here last night? No, I slept in your mother's lab. Oh? Yeah, I went in there after everyone went to bed and the next thing I knew, it was time for my morning swim. Did you find anything in the lab? One of your mother's older journals is a detailed study of the rise and decline of 3,000 families of marine animals. Did you find anything on hemocyanin? No, not yet. How about Anthony? Is there any reference to Anthony? You don't really think you could have a brother, do you? No, I don't think so, but I wonder what she was referring to. Do you think she was investigating hybridization? No, I don't think so. You're against it. Why? I just believe every creature has a right to exist as a separate identifiable being. Relationship study. It is the 28th day of the hybrid's life and there is good news. The electrophoresis chart has been positive for the first time. Anthony has started to express the-- - Cindy, back that up. - Yeah. Relationship study. It is the 28th day of the hybrid's life and there is good news. The electrophoresis chart has been positive for the first time. Anthony has started to express the hemocyanin gene in his blood. There is no doubt in my mind that the DNA incorporation has worked. I wish I could tell somebody about it, the world preferably, but it's too soon. Very few would understand what I've done. Calm, Anthony, calm. I guess she figured if it worked when you got rambunctious. What? My mother used to play that to calm me down. Do you have any idea what she was trying to calm down there? Was it something I said? Duke! Shit. Duke. No, no! No! Hart! My god, what happened? Go back in the house. John, help! Don't tell anyone what you saw. Say it was a mad dog. We don't want to panic everybody. - What happened? - He said a mad dog attacked him. We should get him to a doctor. Hart. John, he'll be all right. We're going to keep him overnight anyway but I'm pretty sure he'll be fine. Great. Can I see him? - Any idea what attacked him? - We think it was a mad dog. You know where it happened? At Shelter Cove near Great Point. What room is he in? The end of the hall. He's under heavy sedation and in a lot of pain. Thank you. Hart. John. She's... She lied. Who lied? Hemocyanin. Oh, my God. How is he? He's going to be all right. Doctor's just keeping him overnight as a precaution. Did he have to get rabies shots? It wasn't a rabid dog. - Yeah, Melissa said Hart told her-- - Perhaps I misunderstood. He was quite incoherent. Well then, what was it? Could've been a coyote up here. A mountain lion even. I saw the results of Hart's blood test. Whatever attacked him left traces of hemocyanin in his blood. Well, that's impossible. Hemocyanin is only found in marine life. Okay, so maybe this coyote or mountain lion had just had a seafood snack. It doesn't work like that. Melissa, you're the expert on hemocyanin. What do you think? Well, it needn't have come from what attacked him. It could have happened here in the lab. You know your mother worked pretty extensively with the stuff and maybe Hart came into contact with it without knowing how dangerous it is. So we'd all better be a little more careful. Have you had a chance to look around for the journals? No, I haven't had time. I've been busy playing house mother. Right now, I have to finish this dissertation. Sharon, what's the matter? Everything- I came up hereto organize your mother's work and have a nice time doing it. It was just going to be you and me and our friends. And then you invite her and some sea monster attacks Hart. What's really bothering you is Melissa's here, right? Right. I see how you are with Melissa, I see how you two work together. And you're also attracted to her. Where are you going? I'll let you get your work done. If I didn't know better, I'd think that you never slept. Oh, I do. But only an hour or so at a time, it's my illness. What illness? Ambition. You know, Melissa, I keep forgetting to tell you how glad I am that you came up here. I haven't really been that much help, have I? But I brought this with me from home in the event of something celebratory happening. Has it? It can, can't it? I'm sorry. I can't do this. Don't apologize. We'll be friends then. What should we drink to? Let's drink to memories that don't get made. But having said that, don't be surprised if you find me sneaking into your bed tonight. Careful, Sharon's a light sleeper. Well, what do you think? It's amazing, it's absolutely amazing. Just amazing. Does John know about this? Well, he's been looking at some journals but not in the basement. For some reason, it hasn't occurred to him that his mother might have hidden anything down there. Well, I don't know why you got involved with Hollins in the first place. I don't understand that, it softened you up a bit. I mean, at this stage of your life. I know. I don't want to go back. It's not just him, I don't like spying. You owe me. Let me see your hands for a minute. Why are you so cold? The medication isn't as effective as it was. Look, I need something stronger. I can't sleep and I'm in a lot of pain. I see. All right. Here, tell you what you do. Use this. You go back the house and you bring me Anthony. Bring me Anthony and you bring me him alive. Look, I don't know where it is. It's not an it, it's a him, it's a him! It was born in the house. It was spawned in Amanda's house. I don't want John to think his brother is dangerous! I'll make a deal with you. You do this for me and I'll make you a stronger medication. Fair? Fair. Dr. Stone. Yes? - Dr. Hollins is here. - Okay. ls everything all right? Have a seat. Hi, I'm Cindy Russell, John's assistant. How is Hart? Well, we're going to have to keep him a couple more days. He's having more of those convulsions and there's something else I'd like to talk to you about. Have a seat, please. Do you know what this stuff is? No. Thought you might've seen it before. ls that why you brought us in to talk? Mr. Phillips' blood tests showed heavy traces of hemocyanin. How do you think it got there? I see you know what hemocyanin is. Last year, there was a similar case in the same neighborhood except the fellow didn't survive it. Billy Kavanaugh. His blood showed even heavier traces of hemocyanin. This morning, I pulled his file from the coroner. Dr. Stone, you're wanted in ER right away. You're eager to see your friend anyway. We'll continue this later. I have some questions I'd like to ask you. Of course. Doctor, could we get a sample of this? I'm sorry, that's against hospital policy. Sorry. Get a sample. Hart. Honey. Let's see what we got here. Electrophoresis chart positive. Termination procedure? Brad? Why are you working in the dark? Because I'm energy conscious. Because I checked the generator a little while ago and we're almost out of gas, that's why. How's Hart? About the same. - What, are they keeping him there? - Under heavy sedation. Melissa, I'd like you to stay, please. I'd especially like you to hear what I have to say. As far back as I can remember, my mother had a handyman named Billy Kavanaugh. I found out today he was killed a year ago near the house. I'm convinced that he was killed by the same creature that damn near killed Hart. Creature? Oh, you mean the hybrid you were worrying about this morning. I read the autopsy report. There are heavy traces of hemocyanin in his blood. You surprised me this morning when you told me that blood tests aren't always accurate. Why, it's true, isn't it? Do you seriously believe that anyone would even think of hemocyanin unless it was there? What I can't understand is why you're so convinced there's some sort of hybrid here. Well, if you can convince me differently, then please do. Look, I've been here all day. So has Brad and Sharon and we've seen or heard nothing. Does that prove that it isn't here? No, of course not. But your being afraid it's here doesn't prove anything either. You haven't seen it, have you? I saw what it did to Hart and I read a graphic description of what happened to Billy Kavanaugh. Look, maybe we should all just get out of here. Yes, I want all you guys to take off. - What do you mean take off? - John. Wait, what do you mean you guys? What about you? I have to stay here and terminate it. You out of your mind? Look, if your mother did achieve this miracle, do you honestly believe she'd want it destroyed? She would have done the same thing if she hadn't had a heart attack. Does thinking that make you feel better about her, John? She sent me up here to end the experiment. Those were her words. She was sick and dying. The Amanda Hollins I admired wouldn't in a million years end such an experiment, not for any reason. Why is this so important to you, Melissa? Goddamn generator. I'll take care of it. Melissa, did you take the car out last night? John, there's your culprit. Great. Did you do this last night, Brad? What are you talking about? I'm talking about taking the gas out of my car and putting it in the generator. Why, what gave you that idea? Because I had a full tank last night and this morning it's almost empty. Well, don't look at me. Did you go out for cigarettes? That is the one I keep in case of nuclear war. - Haven't even touched a cigarette. - Okay. - It might've been Melissa. - What makes you say that? Well, there's something fishy about the girl. I kissed her the other night. It's nothing important, just a little get acquainted offer. I was sorry I did. Why? Because it felt like I was pressing my lips to a chilled shrimp. What are you talking about shrimp for? Are you aware that you're angry at me for no reason? - I'm not angry at you. - Who then? I don't know, nobody! Now that things are getting a little heated here, you mind if I tell you what I think has been happening to you since we came up here? I think you're going crazy! In an imaginative kind of a way. What are you talking about? All right, first you search high and low for a brother that nobody has ever heard of. Now you're trying to find, what, some hybrid that attacks only handymen and dorks. If that's not... What? What is it? Hey, wait a second, John! - John. - Your purse. - Ow, what? - Your purse, your purse. John. What's going on? - John. - What are you doing? - John. - John. For Christ's sake, all you have to do is tell us what you're doing and we can help you, yeah? - Is there something we can-- - Quiet, please, just be quiet. Give me a chance. All right? - John! - What the hell are you doing? I don't believe this. What is it? - They're identical. - Meaning what? Can somebody tell me what this stuff is? That came from the same thing that attacked Hart. - What? - Meaning the thing that attacked Hart and the thing that my mother's calling Anthony, my brother, are one and the same. I don't understand this. How can that thing be your brother? A long time ago, I let my mother take some of my tissue. She needed some human cells for experiments she was working on. Apparently she spliced them into some animal species of some kind, God only knows what. She made a hybrid. She must've started calling it Anthony after her favorite saint. I guess it was just to make it more human for her, less unnatural. Brad? I'll get the car. No! Jeez! Brad, Brad! Let's go. Let's go. Come on! Nurse Perry to the nurse's station. Nurse Perry, please report to the nurse's station. No, no, it's all right. I just have to take some blood. I gotta warn my friends, I gotta warn 'em! Stay in bed. You're in no condition to be getting out. Come on now, you're gonna hurt yourself. Code red, west wing, stat. Code red, stat! Hey, hey, come on! Come on, man! Let me go, get out of my way! - Call security. - Come on, this way, this way. Hey you, come on! Get him! Up there, up there. Come on, come on! Come back here! Hey! Melissa. Where have you been? We've been looking for you. He wants Anthony and whatever Dr. Lloyd wants. He wants him alive. Give me the gun. What are you doing? Dr. Lloyd's bidding. Why? He's the only doctor who's been willing to treat my illness. Ambition. Even more fatal than now, I'm afraid. I contracted it handling hemocyanin. He's made it less painful and has given me hope. - It won't let go! - Hold on. Get something! All right. Pull it. You got her? Got her? Melissa. Oh, my God, she's cold. Melissa, hold on. We'll get you to a hospital. No, only Dr. Lloyd can help. It's too late now even for him. John, the Anthony journals are hidden behind the laundry room. They belong to you. Your mother was my hero. Melissa! - Oh no, God! - No! Melissa! John! Do something! We've gotta do something! Oh, Jesus. What the fuck is happening? No! Brad! Get him! Get him! Help me get him out of here. Brad! Hold on! Yeah, put it on there. It's off, come on, let's go. Let's go, everybody out, come on. Go, go! Take care of Brad's leg. I'm going to go downstairs and check the doors. - No, go back upstairs. - Please, I want to help. - I want to help you. - No, it's too dangerous down here. It's dangerous everywhere, John. John? Sharon! Sharon! John,John! Can you hear me? - Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm all right! I'm all right. I can't see. Hang on, we'll get you out of there. John? Sharon! Here, tie that up to that pole. Grab the rope. - Hurry! - We'll pull you up. - Stay calm. - Hang on, we're coming! Stay back. Can you see it? - You got it? - Okay! John? All right. Here we-- All right, we got you. Hold onto the rope! Hold tight. That's it. -It's coming! - Yeah, okay! It's all clear! Okay, we got you. Sharon! Sharon! Are you okay? I think so! I'm coming down. Hold tight, I'll be right there. Okay, hurry. Oh, God. John! Sharon, come on, come on. Here, here, get back in here. Yeah. Hart! Hart. John and Sharon, they're down there. John, in here. Be careful. I think this is part of the laundry chute. We can climb up. Brad! No, hold on. - Grab my hand! - Hold on! Grab hold of my hand! Okay. Don't let go, I got you. I got you, just pull. Cindy. Calm down, calm down, honey, hold onto me. Grab my hand! Cindy! Cindy! She's gone! Oh, God! Hold on, we'll get it! What are we gonna do? - l've got an idea. Come on! Sharon, you've got to stay here and keep the tape running. Wait, wait, wait, wait. You want me to play it back-- Please just keep the tape running. I'll be back. Hart, what are you doing here? Cindy's down there. What's that for? I'm going down after her. Nobody's going down there. She needs help. The only way we're going to get to her is to kill that thing first. How? Wait a second. I got it. Let's give that freak of nature a little surprise. Sharon. Power's going to go off for a couple of seconds. Now when it comes back on, - you turn the music off, all right? - Okay. It's off. Hold it! Hold it, don't you move. What are you doing here? I've come to collect my legacy from Amanda. He belongs to me. Not alive. You don't get him alive. I get it alive, you understand? Alive or over your dead body, is that understood? It killed Melissa. Well, Melissa didn't have long to live anyway. Now let's go into the house, shall we? Get in the house, I said! Here! Take the wire. No, what are you doing? They're trying to destroy him. You call yourself a scientist? A brilliant scientist? Turn the goddamn power on. Don't you do it! Stop that, by God! You can't do this, John, your mother created it. Don't you do it, no you don't! - Shit. - Leave it alone, come out of there! I need something. And you, you trying to destroy your brother. - That's not my brother. - You listen to me. That's your brother, do you understand that? It was a mistake! My mother knew it, she sent me here to destroy it. You can't destroy it. It was created from your own body, your mother intended it that way. That's why she called it your brother. You're part of it, John. It's part of your heart, part of your mind, part of your soul. He's part of your imagination, you understand? Fry the son of a bitch! - No! - Brad! - Brad, do it! - No! Anthony! Anthony! Oh, my God! No! Thought I'd give it another try. I couldn't find her. I think I got all the journals. Did you get the journals in the laundry room? The ones that Melissa found. I'll get 'em. I'll meet you in the car? What a mess. Where's Hart? Oh, he's in the ambulance. Bleeding stopped. He just can't believe that Cindy's gone. I'll go talk to him. No. Sharon! Matches, matches, matches. Damn! Come on. Magnesium. We're gonna have to get out of here. - Here you go. - Thanks, Hart. I'm going to go back in and I'm going to get Brad. - Are you all right? - Yes, yes. Okay, yeah. Brad! Brad! Don't fail me now. All right. You little bastards are history. Cindy! Cindy. That's it, come on, you can do it, come on. Good, good. I was hiding and... John, Sharon, Hart! What? Where the hell is John? He went in looking for you. No! John! - The house is gonna blow up, get out! - What? Cindy. Get out! The basement is infested with the little bastards! Let's go. Get in! Open the door. Cindy! Get inside.
