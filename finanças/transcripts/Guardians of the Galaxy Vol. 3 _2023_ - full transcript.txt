Come on, Drax, dance. Only idiots dance. I'm a weirdo. I wanna have control. I want a perfect body... Hey! Uh-uh! I told you a million times, you keep your grubby raccoon hands off my Zune! I told you a million times, I'm not a damn raccoon. Again? I love you, Gamora. So what are you gonna do about Quill? Me? Why not you? I got emotionalistical issues. What am I gonna do? Why are you on the ceiling? I wanted to see if these new gravity boots worked on a slope. Here we go. Sorry. (Cosmo speaking Russian) You must know you will never learn. You could do better? Dah. * Telekinesis is cheating! That's a stupid little pebble. I can do that with my dang finger. You're a bad dog. Do not say that to me. You are. You're a bad dog. Take that back. Come on, that's not cool. Nebula, did you hear? He called me a bad dog and he refuse to take it back. I don't care, Cosmo. Is Peter okay? - I don't know. - What are you going to do? Me? He's your brother. It doesn't matter, he still doesn't listen to me. Yeah, he has been pretty mopey ever since Gamora died. She's not dead. She just doesn't remember anything from the past few years. Nobody tells me nothing. Mantis, why don't you just touch him? You know, make him happy. I am Groot. Gross! No, not like that. Touch him with her powers. It is wrong to manipulate the feelings of friends. What about that time you made me fall in love with my sock? Well, that was funny. I guess it's back to one of us touching him the other way. Maybe we should draw straws. No one ever meant that, Drax. What was that?! What the hell?! Where did you go, Squirrel? On the ground! Who is that maniac? Some super-douche with ray gun hands! I don't freakin' know. Who threw this thing at me? Shut up. Baby. Pick on someone your own size. Peter! Peter! We need med packs. Nebula. Piss off! That hurt. What a pity. No! All I did was activate the med pack! Get them off! Now! Oh, hell. - We need to get him to the med bay. - It's destroyed. There's one on the ship! Stitch him up and transfer him in with the rest of batch 89. It's okay. You're here with us now. Hey, who's the new guy? What kind of thing are you? You've got like, a mask on your face. Mask, eyes, face, mouth. Does it hurts? It's okay, friend. Don't let them scare you. Hurts... It's okay. You're gonna be okay. A kill switch? A device. Set to destruct if anyone goes poking around inside him. Or even if we use the med packs. Why would a Rocket have a kill switch? Apparently someone considers him proprietary technology and sent that golden lunatic to get him. So he'll die if we operate on him? - And he'll die if we don't. - There has to be some way to bypass it. It looks like there's a pass key that can override the kill switch. What do we know about where Rocket came from? He won't talk about it. Much of the tech was developed by a company called Orgocorp. And there's a code on all of it. 89P13. He's got maybe 48 hours. - Where are you going? - Orgocorp had to have records, right? Maybe it'll have a way for us to override the kill switch and save Rocket. They won't just give us that information. Well, that's why we're gonna break in. And kill anyone who gets in our way! - Not kill anyone. - Kill a few people. - Kill no people. - Kill one guy, one stupid guy who no one loves. Now you're just making it sad. Kraglin, Cosmo, I need you to keep watch over Knowhere till we're back. Couple of days tops. - Aye, cap'n. - Aye, comrade. - Take back what you said that I'm a bad dog. - Nope. I know you don't really think that I'm a bad dog. - Can you please take it back? - I will not. I located the coordinates of Orgocorp. I think I have a contact near there. Maybe they can help us get in. Contact him. Let's go save our friend. It's good to have friends. My poor baby. Mama, it hurts. - Do you have it? - He does not, sire. I tried to warn you, High Evolutionary. These Guardians are more powerful than you think. Or perhaps you simply overestimate your own value, High Priestess. No doubt, a flaw's on top of my own design. I created you lot as merely an aesthetic experiment. Beautiful numbskulls. But your egos have run wild. Say "ah." And this one was meant to be the Warlock. The apogee of their people. You removed Adam from his cocoon early, my liege. He is still a child. No, there's something wrong with him even outside all that. Yes, there's something wrong with me. I was stabbed, you extraordinary phallus--- He doesn't know any better. We shall do whatever you require, my liege. You knew of 89P13's existence for years without alerting me. That's not what I require! I'm sorry, my liege. Find 89P13 and return it to me. Or, I will destroy your entire civilization as is my right as your maker! Do you understand? Do you understand? Yes... Toodle-loo. How did 89P13 survive after all these years, Theel? It was always clever, sire. Yes, that's exactly why I want it now. - Of course. - Its brain. That is the only reason, sire. But are you really trusting the Sovereign to retrieve it? They're merely a backup. I believe I know where they're going. It's bioformed. Instead of being built, it's grown from living matter. The structure is surrounded by three impenetrable plasmic security shields. It's not gonna be easy to break into this place, Star-Lord. Doesn't have to be easy. I was a professional thief, remember? I'll jam the signals one at a time. She calls me Star-Lord when she's mad at me. She's always mad at everyone. It's because I was drunk. She's right. If I haven't been drinking... Maybe Rocket... I'm sorry. It's okay, he's your best friend. Second best friend. Everyone around me dies. My mother, Yondu... - Gamora... - Gamora isn't dead. She is to us. Do you want a zargnut? Thank you. First shield, set. Three, two, one. - Peter. - What? You had family on Earth. And you never wanted to go back and see them? You're my sister. That's all the family I want or need. Besides, it's probably just my grandpa, okay? He was a pretty hard guy. - Still, don't you think he... - What? You were abducted by Ravagers the same day he lost his daughter. Oh yeah, he was upset. My mom died, he screamed at my face and he pushed me out of the room! He was probably just trying to protect you. - What are you talking about? - What? I'm talking about the people in my life who died, and you're talking about this? Second shield, set. Three, two, one. I'm only saying you've never even gone to see if he's okay. He could still be alive. My grandpa? He'd be like, 90- something years old. So he could still be alive. People on Earth die when they're like 50. They die when they're 50? I don't know. Something like that. What's even the point of being born? Exactly. Are you about to die? I'm not 50! The point is, I wasn't talking about any of this. Third shield, set. Three, two, one. Well, not everything is about what you are talking about. And I'm only saying you're upset because so many people you cared about have left you. But you also left someone. And maybe I wanted a zargnut. Too late. They're all gone. Why didn't we go through? We did. It's not the shield. Oh, hell. Ravagers. Hey guys, you're about to be boarded by the United Ravagers. You can surrender and turn over any stuff worth anything and live. Or you can die. It's up to you. Drax, no, no, no! Drax! Guys, it's me. Peter Quill. I'm one of you, remember? Hold on! - We have an appointment. - We have an appointment. - With who? - With Gamora. With Gamora. What? You're early. What are these? Orgocorp uniforms. You've got to wear these to move through the Orgo without attracting attention. This isn't my color. What did you say? It clashes with my eyes. Put it on! Nebula, why would you not tell me that you've been in contact with Gamora? Because I didn't want you to get freaked out. - Freaked... out?! - Like that. * Gamora, we're grateful for your help. I'm not doing this out of the kindness of my heart. I'm doing this for the hundred thousand units my sister promised. So you're a Ravager now? Put on the uniform. Never pictured you as the Ravager type. Who are you again? Oh, man... OrgoCorp is in possession of some of the most advanced cybergenetic IP in the galaxy. So they're heavily guarded by the deadly Orgosentries. Now I know you don't have documentation to dock. So you're gonna have to get in there on your own. Once in, Gamora is gonna lead you to the records. Where maybe you can find the pass key to override the kill switch. And help you save the hedgehog. But if you get into trouble, we will not be able to bail you out. Yes. Yes, of course. Its functioning has skyrocketed. That's correct, P13. Very good. That's the new world. Counter-Earth. Where the experiments will go once they're ready. - It blue. - That's the sky. Sky. - Rocket. - Yes, it is. What sounds? That's music. - We like it? - We do. This recording is over 5,000 years old. Which translated, is... Be not as you are, but as you should be. It's our sacred mission to take the cacophony of sounds around us and turn it into a song. To take an imperfect clump of biological matter such as you, and transform it into something... perfect. And we're halfway there, aren't we? Come with me, P13. I'd like to show you something. We have but a single quest... To create the perfect species, and the perfect society. You, P13, are part of batch 89. But here, with batch 90, I've developed a process by which I can guide any organism through millions of years of programmed evolution changes, in a moment. See now... There's the rub. For some reason, these specimens are also over producing the legobeta microsamino protein in their systems. Causing them to be, well... Violent. We don't like it. A utopia cannot have its denizens murdering one another, can it? They can't. - Can't. - Can't. Theel. They're programmed to be peaceful, like you. But for some reason, it's not catching. Tectonic filters. What? They suppresaliding the glycusoride sources. And then, boop, boop, boop... Absisting residual deformity. And then, they, make, um... - What do you say? - The legobeta Microsamino proteins. Yeah, thems. And then, angry turtleses. There, that's the decompression chamber. Lock in. Go. Activate gravity boots and gloves. Nebula, go. So you really don't remember anything? Like what? - Bunch of time with us. - No. - Well, we were... - We weren't anything. - You and me... - That was some alternate future version of me. Wasn't me. We loved each other. I don't think so. I know you don't remember any of it... You were everything to me. I miss you. So much. And maybe... Maybe if you open yourself up to it... - There's a possibility... - I don't think so, Quinn. - Quill. - Quill. I don't think so. But what I'm trying to say... Peter, you know this is an open line, right? - What? - We're listening to everything you're saying. And it is painful. And you're just telling me now? We were hoping it would stall on its own. But I switched it over to private. What color button did you push? Blue. For the blue suit. - Oh, no. - Blue is the open line for everyone. Orange is for blue. - What? - Black is for orange. Yellow is for green. Green is for red. And red is for yellow. No, yellow is for yellow. Green is for red. Red is for green. - I don't think so. - Try it, then. Hello! - You were right. - How the hell am I supposed to know all of that!? Seems intuitive. Can we get back to saving our friend? Get that jammer ready to change the shield. Guys? You wanna talk about a sweet ride? The acceleration would crush your spine. It's got that brand new Fusilux core. You know what I'm talking about? - Oh, yeah. - Really? Because I just made that up. Oh, I thought you said something else. Master Karja. - No, you didn't. - I did... I did. Master Karja, there appears to be a physical breach in the white wing somewhere. Could it be a glitch? Maybe? I'm accessing the eye. I'll see if I can locate it. There's some sort of anomaly in the decompression chamber. Best to check it out, Master. On it. Hurry. Where do we put these? Here! Hide them in this locker until we leave. Hurry. What the hell was that, guys? Are you kidding me? - What? - A neutral cork just hit the satellite. It's burning a hole thru the wall. You geniuses just throw the door open without any precautionary procedure? What procedure, bro? Oh, you want us to read the manual for you too, bro? You could have killed everyone in the wing. Exactly, you idiots! I'm angry, too. Oh, no. Can't you see these authentic mechanic uniforms we're wearing on our bodies? That blend in with some of our skin tones better than others? Excuse my friend. He's the boss' nephew. He's a little... Oh... Oh. Yeah, I... I got one of those too. This one? This one, I love. I'm so proud of... You're doing great. So proud of you. But this one... I just... Everything he does drives me crazy. - I thought you said something else. - Shut up. I swear I'm gonna throttle him. I'm gonna go to jail for murder. I am. How did you guys get here so fast? Gonna be honest with you, we just happened in before it burned all the way through, thankfully. Good thing you were here. Alright guys, wrap it up. Looks like we're all clear here. Our spacesuits! You threw them in the contamination bin. It expels stuff into space the moment you shut the door. That would have been helpful information three minutes ago! Dammit, Mantis, why don't you ever think? Oh, are we pretending to be angry again? Mantis, you asshole! Guys, just focus for two seconds. We'll find another way out of here. Right now... We need to save Rocket's life. Nebula, Quinn and I will get to the records and get the pass key. Bug and doufus, access the spaceport thru the elevator so Tree can land and get us out of here. - Oh, apologies. - No problem. Go. It's not my fault I don't know what something is. No one ever tells me. I didn't even want to come here. I'm gonna need to see your... You're hopelessly in love... with him. Oh, no... - Hey. - Hey. How are you doing today? I'm alright. What was your name again? Drax the Destroyer. That's such a lovely name. I'll get the door for you. - I'll be here when you come back out, okay? - Sure. Every single time. My name is Brittle Snorte! Welcome to OrgoCorp headquarters. For over 300 years OrgoCorp has been producing cybernetic implants and genetic upgrades across the universe. Under the watchful eye of the High Evolutionary. That warning we got today. Don't those two match the description? Attention all Orgosentries. That manager should have access to the records. If the pass key is here, she can get it for us. All right. - I'll handle this one. - How? Pure Star-Lord charm. I'm excited that you get to see this again for the first time. Hi, Yura. - Ura. - Oh, Ura. - Hi. - Hi, my name is Patrick Swayze. I've been noticing you for quite a while. And whenever you smile to yourself, when you think nobody is looking, it makes my everyday a bit brighter. We need your hand, and it's your choice whether it's on your body, or not! What are you doing? She was never gonna fall for that. She was totally into me, man. I kinda thought you were a douchebag. Oh, come on. - We need a file. - What file? 89P13. Would that be something? - No. - Then your use to us is over. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Sounds like a species tag. Show us! All of our research supports the High Evolutionary's altruistic objective, of creating a utopian society. That must be the spaceport. Whoa. What is all this? Species patented over the years using OrgoCorp tech. Every species Orgocorp has created has its own individual file. I am so sorry about this. Listen to me, this is not the kinda thing we do. Oh, please, stop it with the subtle jabs! Old you would've never done this. You had a purpose higher than yourself, the calling to help people. That's why you left Thanos and formed the Guardians. Except I didn't form the Guardians and I barely left Thanos. Whoever it was that you were in love with, it wasn't me. It sounds more like her. - Her? - What? - That's ridiculous... - Do not drag me into this. - Knock it off! - What? Don't look at me like a lost puppy needing a safe place to lie down! I didn't say anything. I just never noticed how black your eyes were. They were replaced by my father as a method of torture. He picked a pretty set. There. That's the file for 89P13. Oh, no. Walk! Run, run. Stand down! Drax, we should make a run for it. - Or we can fight. - Run. - Fight. - Run! - Fight! - Take 'em! What are we going to do? - I got a plan. - What is it? All of you, come with--- Everybody, lower your weapons or I blow this woman's brain out! That's the plan? You're a kitty cat. You feel like dancing. Violent rage. Lower your weapons! Now kill that one that looks like a carrot to show we mean business. God! Past Gamora's just mean! She was always like that, and yet I was the bad guy. We are not killing anyone! Back off! Groot, bring the Bowie to us. Now! - I'm so sorry about this, Ura. - Oh, please. We're here to save the life of our friend. That is all. We paid her to help us get in and get out. You'd think that'd mean, "oh, I'm gonna help them do it in a way that no one knows what's happening." But no. What she means is I'm gonna shoot people. Threaten people's lives. Shut up! And now I know you're probably asking "why would I trust her?" Well... That's a good question. The answer is... We used to be in love. Yeah, she was my girlfriend. Only she doesn't remember it because it wasn't her. Because her dad threw her off a magic cliff and she died. Then I lost my temper and nearly destroyed half the universe. And she came back. Out of the past. There she is. Anyone else who died in the past stayed dead. Not her. Why? Was it the magic cliff? I don't know. I'm not some freakin' Infinity Stone scientist. Just some dumbass Earth dude who met a girl, fell in love. That girl died, and then came back a total dick. You left out some important information, but... That is the gist of it. Get to the security helm. Okay! Everybody down on the floor or we blow your brains out. Hey, hey, hey, hey. We don't want any--- Come on! Will you please stop doing that? Hey! Run. Drax! Get on the ground, and show me your hands now. Ura... Please listen to me. We need to get out of here with this. To save my best friend's life. If you can get us into the systems of those sentries out there, they are good people, like you... I'm certain of it. And if I just had an opportunity to speak to them... They're corporate shills, you idiot. They're not gonna listen. They will listen if I speak to them from my heart. Ura... please. Hey! Come out now! Damn it! Stop! You are in. - Tell them your truce--- - Yeah, I'm not that big of an idiot. I just needed to get into the system. Told you she was into me. I am Groot. Yeah. That looked cool. Is sky? No. That's not sky. That's a ceiling. Sire is making a new world for all of us. And when we get there, there will be sky, and it will be beautiful. And forever. I have been thinking. About what? Oh, nothing in particular. But I thought, since you guys are my closest friends, and my only friends, you might be interested in knowing that I have been thinking. That's cool. I've been thinking, too. About something more singular. When sire moves us to the new world, we're gonna need names. I mean, 89Q12... Not really a name. So... I would like my name to be... Lylla. Lylla. Lylla. Lylla. That's a pretty name, Lylla. Thank you. I think my name shall be Teefs. Because although we all do have them, mine are definitely the most prominent. - Teefs. - Teefs. - Lylla. - Teefs. Me be called Floor... Because me is lying on floor. You're lying on a floor, so your name is Floor? Yeah. Floor. What about you, friend? Someday, I'm gonna make great machines that fly. And me and my friends are going to go flying together. Into the forever and beautiful sky. Lylla, and Teefs, and Floor... And me. Rocket. Rocket. It really is good to have friends. Yeah. Start the incision here. Keep calm. - Hold it still. - I can't. It won't stop moving! Why did he never tell us about any of this? This is worse than what Thanos did to me. But what about the pass key? Is it there? No. But a file was removed today. Downloaded and deleted a million characters at length. The biometrics say it was this man. Recorder B2H6. I saw this guy outside of records today. Looks like one of the High Evolutionary's recorders. The High Evolutionary? The founder of OrgoCorp? OrgoCorp is just a way to fund his experiments that lie outside intergalactic laws. He's created whole societies. Xeronians, the Animen. - Sovereign. - The Sovereign? Corners of the universe consider him god. - I am Groot. - Yes. Yes, what? That he's Groot? He said maybe this man downloaded the pass key into the computer on his head. Huh? That can store the pass key. If we find him, we save Rocket. The High Evolutionary's coordinates. Put the coordinates in the nav. Wait a minute. Are you kidding me? What he wants is that gutted badger in the med bay. And you're gonna bring it straight to him? It's almost certainly a trap. A trap isn't a trap if you know the trap is trying to trap you. It's a face-off. A face-off is a trap if you're facing off against a guy a thousand times more powerful than you. Do you know who the High Evolutionary is? Yeah, he's some dickhead who dissected my best friend. Second best. The High Evolutionary isn't someone you wanna think about messing with. We won't think about it when we do it. You know what? I don't care. Just drop me off with the Ravagers and you go do whatever it is you wanna do. We don't have time for this. I'm not asking you. Drop me off with my people now. Your people? The Ravagers aren't your people. I'm a damn Ravager. You aren't. Listen, I know you were always looking for a family, okay? But my Gamora, the one I loved, she didn't find it with a group of criminals. She found it with us. People who care about you. I know that's who you still are. Somewhere inside of you... What are you so afraid of in yourself, that I need to be something for you? I don't give a shit about your Gamora! Life made me me! I have a few upgrades courtesy of that gutted badger in the med bay. And we are not risking his life to make yours more convenient. - I'm family. - So is he. Screw you. Screw all of you. Found him on the outskirts of the first shield, pirating supply ships. I do appreciate this, good sir. And I appreciate your contribution to the Orgosentry retirement fund. Your associate. A Zehoberi named Gamora. - Where is she now. - You'll get nothing from me! Oh, we'll see about that, won't we? Adam. Adam! - Yes, mother. - Show him we mean business. I said show him we mean business! Not disintegrate him! Well, what business could we have shown him? But now he is of no use to us! Well let's just question the man's friend! Friend? You think that's a friend? It's an animal! He looks sad. I really don't enjoy how that's making me feel, actually. Your friend's a moron. I got one of those, too. I get it. Outpost? This is Gamora. Are you there? If you can pick this up, come in. Outpost, come in. Yes, Gamora. Salutations. May I help? Well, I need you guys to come pick me up. I'm gonna upload the location link to the craft I'm on. Oh, I think we can arrange that. You need to say to him exactly what I told you to say. Why don't you just say it? No one ever listens to me. Quill. Life is a pond. And you spent your entire life leaping from woman to woman, as if they are lily pads upon this great pond. Perhaps what you need to do, Quill... ... is learn to swim. - That actually made sense. - Yes it made sense. No, I mean, 'cause that's sort of an analogy. I didn't know that you were capable of that... I thought... I know lots of analogies, Quill. Analogies, metaphors, etcetera? For instance... Gamora's head is like a lily pad. Because it's green. Analogy. And also, stupid-looking and flappy. - Flappy? - Because her skin is made of leaf. - Metaphor. - Is it? Yesterday, I made a poop shaped like a fish. Even my butt, is capable of making an analogy. Oh. What's happening? The fluid is in his lungs. P13! P13! Sire. P13! Sire was in the middle of his treatment, soon we had a breakthrough with that tube. Perhaps then we should resume tomorrow... We will not resume tomorrow, no! P13 Oh, ooh, there you are. Hello. How did you know about the microsamino proteins, P13? What happened in there? Why? How did you know, P13? It was too little filtration. In the hyperthermic, yes, we know. We fixed that. But how did you know? I made you! How did you know!? Because it worked. It worked... The rage, is gone. We have the peaceful creatures we always sought... Ready to inhabit the new world. We're going to the new world? Oh... we? Look at you. It's if you were cobbled together by fat-fingered children. How could you be part of a perfect species? You're simply a... medley of mistakes we could learn from in the plight of the creatures that truly matter. Batch 89... was never meant for the new world, P13. You could figure out the complex workings of cytoplasmic filtration systems, but you couldn't figure out that? But that brain... That, I'd like to study further. Prep it for surgery and removal in the morning. What about the rest of batch 89, sire? Incinerate them. He's dying. We need that pass key. We don't have long. We've arrived. That looks just like... home. It's like a replica of Earth. It makes no sense. Atmosphere is habitable. Gravity is and/or minus one. Hello. We mean you no harm. Listen to me, he was just trying to throw her back the ball. Please, no... Hey! Hey. Groot! Full kaiju! - Not full kaiju! - I am Groooooot! Get down, Groot! Everybody, it's okay. Hey. Hi. We're not here to harm you. Okay... you see? For your knee. We just need to save our friend. It doesn't belong here. I will train it in the ways of the Sovereign. I will train him not to do that. The blasphemy even having it here. Kill it! Now. I'm the Warlock, mum, and I'm done of being ordered around. Gamora is here. Which means the squirrel is, also... To save ourselves, we must bring it to the High Evolutionary before his own people do. Yeah, yeah. Sit. Let's sit. Okay. I am Groot. It's not rude, it's what it's here for. Drax, sit up! Idiot. Thank you. Thank you. Our friend, he's dying. We love our friend. But he is dying. That's not dying. That's already dead. They'll think he's already dead. They'll think we are here on a quest for revenge. Drax, sit up! - That's what it's here for. - Drax, it isn't. It's made for people to sit shoulder to shoulder right next to each other. Get your boots off their pillows. I find it hard to believe it doesn't have a multiple purpose. I'm sorry. My friend is a dumbass. That's the same as your dying. Why do you criticize everything? So why is the couch long then? It was a totally different sound. No it isn't. Ugh! Dying... ugh! Dumbass... see? It's the same. Alright, guys. Can I proceed, please? We're trying to save our friend. Drax, I see you. I understand that none of this makes any sense to you right now. We need your help in finding a man. I'm gonna draw. I'm gonna draw the man that we're looking for. You see the thing on her head? He has a thing... That is delightful. There you go. Have you seen this man? That's very good. Can I have that later to hang on my apartment, please? Yeah, thank you. His name? His name is Motio? Many Motios. There? That pyramid? Is that your car in the driveway? Drax, stay here with Rocket. Watch him, that's who they're coming for. - I want to come! - No. Mantis, watch Drax. Groot, you know what to do with these. Push down on it. - What? - Push it down. I am pushing down on it. Push the button. Looks like you're pushing the keyhole. - What? - There's a button under the handle. Press that in. Okay. Now what? Open the fucking door! That is a stupid design. And the instructions were very unclear! Let's get that pass key and save our friend. I was 8 years old when I left Earth, okay? Why would I know any more about driving one of these than you do? Don't say you're volunteering. - You want me to drive? I'll drive. - No! I don't want you to drive. I got this. You must be a really loyal pet if they're willing to do all this for you. This is the perfect society? Sire... This one has been running for two hours without breaking a sweat. That's incredible, if I... They can survive on 30 calories a day and half of sleep a week. They are always happy. And they can rewire a carbonetrix core in under two minutes. But will she be ready for the new colony? Sire, they're here. Here we go. - We're here to see... - The High Evolutionary's expecting you. Which means it is a trap. It's a face-off. She stays here. - Why? - Policy against weaponry. And your arm is a gun. - He's clean. - Let's go. Hey. It'll be okay. Move it! Are you okay, Rocket? Me and Rocket play now? I can't right now, Floor. - What are you doing? - They ain't gonna set us free. Yes they are, Rocket. We're going to the new world any day now. No, that can't be true. It is. They wanna kill us all in the morning. - What? - What? But I'm gonna fix it. What is that? It's a key. I'm gonna use it to get us all outta here. I don't know if that's wise, Rocket. Me, Rocket, leave! Hurray, friends forever! Just down that hall, there's ships. I know that if we can get to one, I can pilot it. And then we'll all fly away together. The four of us, just like we always said, okay? Okay? Woohoo! Yippee, Rocket! Sky, sky, sky! You did it! You did it! You did it! It really is good to have--- Yes, I imagined you'd do something like this. Back in the cage, P13. Sky... Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now! Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now! Q12 and P13 escaped from their pens. Q12 is neutralized, but... P13 is still out, so I'll need assistance. Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now! Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now! Remember, not to bruise its brain. Alright, P13! You win the crying contest, now back in the cage! Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now! Just go! Rocket, please! Rocket! Rocket! Down here, hurry! What are you doing? I have a bad feeling about this. Peter just told you to stay here. Yeah well, that's his fault. He should know by now that I never do anything that anyone ever tells me. We need to protect Rocket. Yeah, that's right. So hop on. And we'll ride back to the ship. Just right over there? Yeah. Drax! Hey, stop being a jerk. You! Hey! Yeah, you. I take it the pass key, it's in that thing on your head. I would advise against aggression. Oh, got time for me now? Your friend once took advantage. I learned my lessons. I aimed some small part of my mental capacity back in my own direction. And now, gravity itself serves my whims. War Pig, now. You must find Counter-Earth familiar. - Counter-Earth. - I visited your planet many years ago. Earth hasn't been my planet in a long time. Your people had... Wonderful spirit. The art, music and literature, were some of the finest in the universe. Earth would be a fabulous place were it not for the ignorance and bigotry. - Okay. - It inspired me to create Counter-Earth. - I don't care... - All of the good and none of the bad. I don't need another speech by some impotent whackjob whose mother didn't love him, rationalizing why he needs to conquer the universe. I'm not trying to conquer the universe... I'm perfecting it. What the... Hey! Drop the badger. I just want the pass key. Then bring me 89P13. I am Groot. He says suck my--- Why are you so angry? Because I know what you did to our friend. Anything I've done, I've done for the betterment of the universe. Newsflash, Einstein. Better universe generally don't include a bunch of octopuses selling meth to guys with cockroach heads. They do not. Which is why, as I've done many times before... I'm going to have to raze it all, and start again. I got 89P13 and I'm on my way. We're in possession of the subject. Oh, my God. I am Groot? Kill them all. Stay. I said stay. What? Did you want me to leave you back so that mother could pull at you? Stay. What the hell, we're working for the same boss. Yes, but I need the credit, chum. To save my entire civilization. So be a good creepy... thing, and back off. Oh. Mother. Mother! Mantis, Drax, come in. Mantis, Drax? - Uh, hey. - I need you to bring the ship here, now! Well, we can't do that exactly, because... We're not in the ship. Then where the hell are you? - Nebula, come in. - Gamora! Take off now! Get yourself and Rocket off the planet! What kind of ship is this? That's amusing, really. How stupid are you? It was so obviously a trap. It's not a trap, it's a face-off! Now, kill them all. Grenade! I am Groot! No, no, no, please. * Thank you, thank you. That would be premature. Huh? No, no, no, no! Quite a novel escape plan. Jumping headfirst into an exploding planet. You'll kill us both! Not both! Why are we doing this? Quill and Groot are inside! We have to get them out. Groot. Whoever's in the cockpit, activate the brake. The steering mechanism is stuck! Well, pull harder! Let's go! It's hard to breathe. We are entering space. Oh, piss off. What kind of monster slaughters a civilization? - Where are Mantis and Drax? - I do not know! You're lucky I was able to knock down that door. Rocket and Gamora, are probably dead because of you! - I didn't know. - Oh, you didn't know? When are you gonna stop using the excuse of being some big dumb clown for contributing nothing, and the rest of us having to carry your slack! Don't push him! You don't have the right to push him. And you, you're no better. The only thing we can count on you for, is when someone shows weakness, you'll be right there to support it. Fine, I don't care. I know you need to find fault in everyone else to make yourself feel okay. So find it in me. Go to hell, Mant! But you don't have the right to push him! It's not his fault he's stupid. He's a liability. He makes us laugh and he loves us. How is that a liability? All you care about is intelligence and competence. Not sure I appreciate this defense. He has sadness... But he's the only one of you who doesn't hate himself. I don't care if he's stupid. Do you think I'm stupid? Yes. Forget. Hah! You're lucky I was able to knock down that door with my incredible strength. Quill? Quill, are you there? This language isn't in my translator. Okay. Alright, Rocket. Go. Lylla? Friend. Okay. Okay... Okay, here we go. This isn't right. No, no, no. It's good. It's gonna work. It's working. It needs to be faster. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. - Rocket. - I let you down. I got you killed. You were right. The sky is beautiful. And it is forever. And I've been flying with our friends. Can I come? Yes. No, no, no, no. No! - Come on! - Quill. No! No! - Quill... - No! - I'm not gonna lose him. - He is gone. I'm not letting him go! But not yet. You still have a purpose here. A purpose for what? They made us for nothing! Just a bunch of experiments to be thrown away! There are the hands that made us... and then there are the hands that guide the hands. My beloved raccoon... This story has been yours all along. You just didn't know it. I'm not a raccoon. The pass key's coming through! Where's Nebula? She, she's, uh.... 'Cause her call's on the comm behind you. - What... Nebula? - Where are you? - Oh, thank God! - We're here to get you out of here. - Out of where? - The High Evolutionary's ship! No, I got off the ship. - You what? - Wait, where are you? On the ship! - On the ship?! - I didn't lie. - Why are you on the ship? - To save you, obviously! No, I told you to go back. You gotta know by now I always figure out a clever way to get out of a fix! - Tell him I said hi. - Really? Tell him we're coming to save him. Pay attention or play with the kids. One or the other. - Play with the kids? - How did you get out? - That's not really important... - I am Groot. Jumping a 1000 feet to your death without a parachute is a clever way of getting out of a fix? You're only just making up stuff that he's saying, right? The important thing is we're all okay. Rocket? Yes, he's here and he's okay. Rocket, we love you very much and we're happy you're alive. Well that makes you idiots, then. He's right about that. Back in your cages! Nebula? Nebula, come in. So, you'd like to joust, would you? Go to hell, you sick son of a bitch. You killed all of those people. As I will your friends. I'm sending you the coordinates. They will die unless you bring me what is mine! Screw you, you stretch-faced, Robocop looking, Skeletor wannabe, purple-nurple, piece of--- He hung up. You think? 1966... The Soviets put me on a rocket knowing full well I never to return and I will die in a fiery ball of death. The one thing even Soviets never do, is call me "bad dog." Oh, my God, just let it go. Kraglin, please, just take it back. This is killing us. I can't take it back if she is, in fact, a bad dog. It never stops hurting. - Kraglin. - Oh, hey, Pete. We need to save Nebula, Mantis and Drax, and we need your help. Me? You're the one who lost him, you twit! The hellspawn heard it, sire. - But... - But, but, but, but, but! That rancid word. I'm merely wondering whether it might be wiser, to go directly to the new colony and not engage in unnecessary conflict. They can rewire a carbonetrix core in under two minutes. But what is that, Vim? - Rote memorization. - Rote memorization! In hundreds of years of our creations, only one has known true invention. One. Putrid in every other way, but 89P13 had that. Yes, sire. A populace unable to think, what hasn't yet been thought, will die. And why we need 89P13's brain so we can transfer that trait into these creatures before we go to the new colony. Nothing else matters. How did they get down here? Peter will be trying to get to the spaceport. He doesn't know about the children. You! We need you to let all the other children onboard know to stay away from the starboard walls! They know three freaking words and two of them are joob. No! Listen to me. You need to talk to the other children. All of them here, and tell them, to stay away, from the freakin'---- What the hell are you doing, Mantis? Explaining it, dickhead! You're scaring them. Hello, dumb idiots. I had a little girl like you. You know what she used to like? She liked when I made monkey noises. How is that a monkey? Beats me. They're gonna tell the other kids to stay away from the starboard wall. Why didn't you tell us you knew their language this whole time? Why didn't you ask? This could be futile, Quill. He's too powerful. Well then, I guess we'll die trying. What is dying trying gonna accomplish? Or we can just give him the badger. Our thing, is dying trying. I am Groot. I know who you are already! Feel free to stay behind in the cargo area. I'm not leaving my sister with that jackass. This you? Fell out of your bag. Let's do this. Wait... Wait... You almost have to admire their pluck. Sire. Howdy there, you freakin' creep. - Back up! - Yes, sire. You're on, Steemie. First barrel. Second barrel. Third barrel. Fourth barrel. Hard starboard. Hard starboard. And, fire! They've breached the spaceport. One of them holds subject 89P13. Release the hellspawn, all of them. Sire, the hellspawn were created solely to defend the new colony. Do it now! Get me 89P13, and kill everyone in the head of that dead god! Spaceport wide open, Cap'n, but that armaments was all we had. Rocket, Groot, go, go! Get inside that spaceport. What the hell? Aww, come on! Kraglin, we have been infiltrated! Open the pit. Sire, our bargaining power will be gone. Abilisks! Good God... This way! One more step and this weird thing gets it! Don't be rash. What were you programming? Self-destruction code. What are you doing? It's okay. Mantis, stop. They eat batteries, not people. Maybe they're just scared of what we are gonna do to them. We're not gonna hurt you. Everything is going to be okay. Use your heart, boy. A dog? Yeah. She's a good dog. I knew you believe I'm good dog. Alright, alright, alright. Get off me. Sire, we must retreat. The ship is going down. The spaceport has intruders. Go, see if one of them is 89P13. Sire, you have an irrational obsession with this animal. You must stop for God's sake--- There is no god! That's why I stepped in! Controller, I am taking command of the Arete. Disengage all damaged sectors of the ship. And retreat... Attention, all personnel... Intruders have boarded the ship. Head to the starboard spaceport. Bring me 89P13. And kill the rest. We go in there, we get Mantis, Nebula and Drax. We move in, we get them, and get out. Did that look cool? Okay. New gameplan. We get the hell outta here now. There are thousands of creatures on this ship. - Many of them are children. - We need to be good joob-joob. - Huh? - It means friends. If we want to live, we have to leave now. This whole rig is gonna go down any second. They will all die, if we don't help them. I'm done runnin'. There's a big hole up in the deck. If we can connect that to Knowhere, we can lead the survivors to safety. Nebs and me will pilot the ship. You guys save all the higher life forms. Hello, moron. Come on! Follow me, come on! Come on! Go, go, go! I am Groot. Um, this way to... Thank you. Yes, you're welcome. I was screaming at something scary behind you. Not you. You look really cool. Kill me if you want, but then good luck getting out of here. Let him go. That guy's our only chance. I got a space big enough to get through. I gotta find out if I can change it to a permeable shield. I can't fly this freakin' thing. The controls are all screwed. I'll do it. Go help the others. Wait, give me your comm. Kraglin, I'll pilot from this side. Nebula, back in action. Come on, come on, come on! Go, go! Go, go, go! Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop! Are those kids? Okay, Cosmo, stitch it up. It needs to be airtight for the kids to make it across! Locking up, captain. Go, now, go. One by one. One by one. Landing in, and headed down. This way, this way. Why? Why are you doing this? I tried to kill you. I am Groot. He says everyone deserves a second chance. You are so strong. Come on! Why are you so slow? Where is Rocket? No! You thought you could escape me? No! You think you have some worth in and of yourself without me? No! You are an abomination! Nothing more than a step, on my path! You freakish little monster! How dare you think you are more? 8-9-P-1-3! The name's Rocket. Rocket Raccoon. His face came off. It's a mask. Look what you did to me. For what? All I wanted to do... was to make things perfect. You didn't want to make things perfect. You just hated things the way they are. Kill him. Why? Because I'm a freakin' Guardian of the Galaxy. We have to get out of here, now. We have to save them We've got all the kids on board. No, Pete. The rest of them. Come on! Come on, move. Move it. Whoa. Come on. Come on, come on. I thought we were limiting ourselves to the higher life forms. Me, too. Go babies. Go, babies. Go! I cannot hold... much... Quill! Hurry! Peter! Peter. Did that... ... look cool? Come on. Cosmo. I'm okay. I am Groot. Thanks, just tell them I'm gonna be right... I am Groot. Yeah. It's good working with you too. Hey Gamora, are you ready? Yeah. You know I'm still not who you want me to be. I know. But who you are ain't so bad. I bet we were fun. Like you wouldn't believe. All right. Are you okay? I think I need to talk to everybody. So, you're gonna leave? My mother died in front of me when I was 8 years old and I have been running ever since. I'm gonna need to take some time. Learn how to swim. I as well. I love you all. I do. But my whole life, I did whatever Ego wanted. And then I did whatever the Guardians wanted. I need to go out and discover what I want. - I will come with you. - No Drax. That's the whole point. But you need someone to protect you. - I don't. - Not in a bad way. Just because of your incredible weakness. Oh, my God, you're so frustrating. Drax, I need you here. We're building a new society. I need all the support I can get for those children out there. Today, I saw who you are. You weren't born to be a destroyer. You were born to be a dad. So you'll lead the Guardians then? No. I'm going to lead the city. Make it the type of home I never had. So that's it? The group's over? No. The galaxy still needs its guardians. And you, will make a better leader than I ever was... Captain. I love you, guys. Welcome home. I think I might be at the wrong... I'm looking for Jason Quill? Yes. Come in. Pete. Hi, Grandpa. Okay, how about your favorite musical act? Phyla, you first. Britney Spears and Korn. - Good choices. - I gotta go with the man. Garth Brooks. The Carpenters did not have a single bad song. Adrian Belew. Both solo, and his work with King Crimson. What about you, captain? Oh, this one's kinda special. ♪ come and get your love ♪ Guess they're here. Well... I can handle this by my lonesome if you all wanna chill. Nah, nah, it'll go fast if we all do it together. Groot, wake up. Does anyone feel a little sad for them? Yeah, sure. But these townsfolk can't protect themselves. On your word, Captain. Word.
