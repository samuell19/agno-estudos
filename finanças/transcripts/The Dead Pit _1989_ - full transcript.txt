(suspenseful music) (maniacally laughing) (shouting) (suspenseful music) (moaning) - Doc, Doc hold my calls please. I don't have time Doc. Hold my calls. (suspenseful music) (bell chiming) - I can't cover up for you any longer Colin. Whatever you're doing to them has to stop. - Are you going to stop me Joe? - I don't know you anymore. - You never did. (suspenseful music) (shouting maniacally) (suspenseful music) (gasping) (suspenseful music) (echoing moaning) (suspenseful music) (rats squeaking) (suspenseful music) (moaning) - What the... (suspenseful music) (coughing) Formaldehyde? (suspenseful music) (rat squeaking) (gagging) - You don't look well Gerald. Let me help you. - You're supposed to be doing research. This is sick! My god, you're a doctor. You're supposed to be saving lives. - I've done life. Now I'm doing death. - You're a fucking maniac. (suspenseful music) (groaning) - Think your last thought Doctor. (suspenseful music) (chuckling) You can't kill me. (gun firing) (suspenseful music) (maniacal laughing) (suspenseful music) (dramatic eerie music) (crying) (dramatic eerie music) (bell chiming) (eerie music) (crazily laughing) - [Man] Hey, hey. (door slamming) (moaning) - Nurse Robbins. Please take Mrs. Simmons to the F ward, third down, and make sure she knows the rules. - Yes Nurse Kygar. - You next. From what it says here you were found wandering the streets with no identification and no idea of who you are. Is that correct? - Yes, but I don't belong in a place like this. - And what do you mean, "a place like this?" - I can't remember my past, that doesn't make me crazy. - The court psychiatrist evaluated you and decided that this is the perfect place for you to receive therapy. - I don't need therapy. I just need to get out of here. - Right now you are a ward of the state. Your psychiatric condition and memory loss are the reasons we're forced to intervene on your own... - I didn't lose my memory, it was taken from me. I told them it was taken. (rumbling) - [Kygar] Move. (rumbling) (frantic chattering) (gasping) - They need help. They're need help. The people in the cellar need help. - Get down on the floor and cover your head. (suspenseful music) (rumbling) - They need help. - What? - The people in the cellar need help. - [Gerald] It's alright. - They want out, the people in the cellar, you have to let them out, you have to help them. - [Gerald] It's only an earthquake. Okay everybody the earthquake seems to be over. - Please. Let them out. Can't you hear them? The people in the cellar need help. Let them out! - Nurse Kygar. - Let them out! - I need help. - They need help. They need help. They need help. (yelling) (suspenseful music) (chattering) (suspenseful music) - Good morning. How do you feel today? - Fine. - I'm Nurse Robbins, I'll be showing you around a bit. We'll get you some breakfast before your session with Dr. Swan. - Who's he? - Oh he's the head psychiatrist here. You'll like him. (suspenseful music) - Oh Jane, come in. I'm Dr. Swan. Why don't you come over here and have a seat. How are you? I was concerned about what happened after the earthquake yesterday. - Earthquake? - Do you remember what happened? - Yeah. I was with the nurse and everything started to shake. She pushed me into the hall. After that I went black. I must've fainted or something. - Do you remember seeing me in the hallway yesterday? - No. - Let's talk about amnesia. I've treated quite a few cases here that are similar to yours and through hypnotherapy we can trigger core memories which can eventually lead to partial or even total recall. - I'm not like your other cases, I don't have amnesia. - What do you think it is then? - You'll think I'm crazy, like the people who threw me in here. (chuckling) - Try me. - Well I don't remember my past, but I remember how I lost it. Someone or something took my memory from me. I was on a table in an operating room and my head was open and then my memories were cut out and then the, I know how it sounds, but it's true. - Well it sounds as if you've been through some terrible trauma. We'll have to take this nice and slow one step at a time. I think hypnotherapy will open some doors and we should start that tomorrow. Now if you feel up to it why don't you take a walk around the grounds. Get some fresh air. - Alright. (dramatic eerie music) (suspenseful music) (eerie music) - Civilization will be the death of humanity. (Laughing) (manic chattering) - [Man] He's trying, really sometimes. - Cat man. Do you know where my cat man is? Oh Toots. (Crazily laughing) Toots, cat man. (manic chattering) (laughing) - Oh no I thought maybe we could get out of here this weekend. - You're gonna get me in trouble. (manic chattering) How was your session with Dr. Swan? - It was alright. - This is Christian Meyers. Watch out for him, he's a flirt. - Only with beautiful nurses. My friends call me Chris. - I can't tell you my real name, I call myself Jane, Jane Doe. (chuckling) - So you're a double agent then like Mr. Kinski over there. - Jane has amnesia. - I don't remember my past, that's why I'm here. - I'm sorry Jane give it some time. People here want to help, it's not such a bad place. - Robbins I was expecting you in Iso ward 10 minutes ago. - I'm sorry Nurse Kygar I forgot the time. - I don't want it to happen again. - There's some real horror stories around here about Nurse Kygar. - I'm not surprised. - Like she tortures those poor bastards up in Iso ward just for kicks. - Iso ward? - Isolation, upstairs. It's where they keep the real crazies locked up. - So many people stuck in here. - Nothing like it was in the 50s and 60s. See all those buildings out there? They were full back then, but when the government funding dried up they let all the loonies out onto the street. This building's the last outpost. - Why are you here? You don't seem crazy. (laughing) - I've been known to get crazy from time to time. I like to blow things up. Demolitions expert in the service, kind of stuck. So there was this little incident and I had some psychiatric treatment before so my lawyer gets me a couple of months in here instead of six months in the pen. - Have you got a cig? Chris, you got a cig? - Sure Bud. - I got me one bad headache man. One bad headache, since that shaker, that did it. - Jane this is Bud. Bud worries a lot, but he's harmless. - Of course I am, of course I am. Teasing, you know all the time teasing. (laughing) Oh it's nice to meet you, it's a pleasure, a pleasure. So, hey you want to play some cards tonight? (bell chiming) - Sure. - Oh good, good. You want to play bridge? - [Chris] Bridge, Buddy, Buddy, poker's the game. - [Bud] Poker, poker huh? I could do poker, okay good. (suspenseful music) - Who is that out there? - Oh yeah, that's the crazy nun. (chanting in a foreign language) - Yep, that's Sister Clair, she's out of it, but I've never seen her do anything like this before. Hey, Sister Clair, what're you doing? Holding a prayer meeting without us? (laughing) - [Clair] No, no. (suspenseful music) (laughing) - Stop, please stop it! - Hey take it easy, everything's okay. - [Jensen] What's going on here Meyers? - Nothing to be concerned about Jensen. Just talking about the playoffs, got a bit excited. - Yeah the playoffs, the game, the big game. - Bullshit Meyers. You know the rules pal. - Right Mr. Jensen. - I'm sorry. - It's not your fault. I should've left the old nun alone. (suspenseful music) (bell chiming) (screaming) (groaning) (screaming) (laughing maniacally) (gasping) (eerie music) (heavy breathing) - Jessica, double shift huh? - Double time, double money Jimmy. - Well aren't you ambitious? - No I promised myself a trip to New Orleans for the Mardi Gras. (eerie music) (heavy breathing) - How is it down here tonight? - It's quiet. - I wish I could say the same for isolation. Everyone of them nuts is up banging, screaming. It's very creepy. (laughing) - I wonder what's agitating them. (mimicking The Twilight Zone theme song) Right. (suspenseful music) (heavy breathing) Is everything okay Jane? - I was just going to the bathroom. - Are you having trouble sleeping? - Yeah. Nightmares. (suspenseful music) (heavy breathing) - Look I'm gonna be here all night if you need me for anything okay? Just come to the nurses' station. - Thanks. (suspenseful music) (heavy breathing) (suspenseful music) (gasping) (suspenseful music) (heavy breathing) (suspenseful music) (bell chiming) (chattering) - Jensen, have you seen Nurse Robbins? - No one's where they're supposed be today pal. (chattering) - Excuse me Nurse Kygar I've been looking for Nurse Robbins. She hasn't been around all day. - That's right, she hasn't. And she didn't fill out her patient reports last night. She left her post and there's no excuse for that. - I'm sure she'll have a good reason. I saw her car outside. She'll probably be back soon. - [Jane] She's not coming back. - What do you mean by that? - I don't know. I don't know. (manic chattering) (eerie music) - Just sit back and relax. It's a simple procedure actually. I just want you to breath deeply, regularly, and watch the pendulum. Keep your eyes on the pendulum and relax. Deeply relax. That's it, fall back. Let go. Deeper. Deeper. (eerie music) Now I want you to go back. Back to the time when you were happy. What are you doing? - Playing on the monkey bars. - And how old are you? - Three years old. - [Gerald] What's your name? - Sara. - What's your last name Sara? - I don't know. Where's your mother Sara? - Here she comes, she's running. We have to go, we have to hide. - Where are you going? - Far away, we're moving safe, far away. - Where is your daddy Sara? - I'm not supposed to talk about Daddy. - It's okay to talk to me. - No, no not ever. No. - Sara? - I... - Sara. Sara! - No, don't call me Sara. Mama will be so mad at me. (Crying) - Jane snap out of it. Jane, come out of it, come out of it. - What happened, why are you standing over me like that? - A deep memory was triggered by the hypnosis. Nothing to be alarmed about. - What was it? - Well I'd prefer to wait a few sessions before we... - I don't, I want to know what it was. - Alright, alright I'll tell you if you'll calm down. It seems your mother might have taken you away from your father at a very early age. It was a traumatic experience for you. She might've tried to change your names, your identities, which could be a link to the amnesia. - I don't have amnesia. I don't want to be hypnotized again. I told you what happened to my memory. - That would be a mistake Jane. It seems to work very well for you. - Dr. Swan I have a terrible sense of danger here. I can't sleep at night. This place gives me nightmares. - Through further hypnotherapy I think you'll find that it's not this place, but things in your past that are causing the nightmares. (knocking on door) Yes? - I'm sorry Dr. Swan, but we have an emergency in the common room. One of the patients is code red. - [Gerald] You wait right there. (manic chattering) - I'm gonna cut out his brain. I'm gonna cut it out. His brain man! - What are you doing Bud, you're out of here in two months. You're really blowing it. Jensen's not worth a shit. You don't believe in violence remember we talked about it, huh? What the fuck's the matter with you? This is me, Chris. - Chris. - Chris. (thumping) (groaning) (manic chattering) - You crazy lunatic. (thumping) - What are you doing? You don't have to hurt him. - That's enough. (manic chattering) Get him upstairs and put him in a jacket. - This whole place guys. You're all fools! This place is going down. You're all going down! No, no! No! (eerie music) - [Clair] Take this. (eerie music) (crazy laughing) - How did he get this? - The east wing supply room was broken into last night. I have no idea how he did it. There were other items missing as well. - Well check his room and anywhere else where he might've hidden something like this. I don't want a repeat of this incident. - Of course Doctor. (eerie music) - What happened with him? - I don't know. He's been having these headaches ever since the quake. How does that turn a sweet, funny, harmless little guy like that into a card carrying psycho? You tell me what's going on Doctor. (eerie music) (suspenseful music) (bell chiming) (maniacal moaning) (suspenseful music) - No. No. I don't want to think anymore. No more thoughts. No more. God. God. (suspenseful music) (maniacal moaning) (screaming) - What the hell? (laughing) Damn. (suspenseful music) (laughing) Son of a bitch. (suspenseful music) (crazily laughing) (suspenseful music) (bell chiming) (panting) (suspenseful music) (bell chiming) (crazily laughing) (suspenseful music) (crazily laughing) (suspenseful music) Fucking nut. (suspenseful music) (glass shattering) (suspenseful music) Shit. (suspenseful music) Alright, qualified for the marathon. It's time to go back. (suspenseful music) (gasping) (suspenseful music) Oh jeez. (suspenseful music) (gasping) (suspenseful music) (gagging) (laughing) (murmuring) (gasping) (suspenseful music) - [Colin] I'm the head surgeon here. - No. No! (laughing) No! (screaming) (thudding) (crying) - Come on now tell me what's wrong? - No, no. - What's wrong? Breathe. Dr. Swan says you've been having nightmares. - It wasn't a nightmare. - Why don't you take a few deep breaths so you can tell me what happened. - Come on. - I thought I saw someone. I thought... Maybe it was a nightmare. - [Colin] Poor girl. - Come here. - No! - Let me ease your mind. - No. No! - No! - Orderly. (screaming) Orderly. - No! No. (Laughing) (screaming) - Get her a shot. - No, no, no. - Orderly. - I've got her. (screaming) - The door was open when I came in. - I've checked everywhere, he's gone. - What does the report say? - Jimmy didn't fill one out. It's pure negligence. - What are you doing here? - I came to check in on Bud. - Too late man, he's vanished. - What do you mean he's vanished? - Dr. Swan. - Yes? - I found something, look, it's human isn't it? - Where'd you get this? - Well since that Bud guy was gone I figured I'd eat his breakfast, but this was on the plate. Doesn't look like French toast to me. - Look I don't know what's going on here. - I want to know where Bud is and Nurse Robbins hasn't been here for two days. - She probably ran off with the night orderly Jimmy. She was always sniffing after him. - You know that isn't true. - Orderly take Meyers downstairs and make sure the duty nurses are aware that he's having a hard day. You're a good nurse Kygar, a good nurse. (maniacal screaming and moaning) (screaming) - Wake up, Jane wake up, you're having a dream. It's a dream Jane. It's almost lunch time. I let you sleep in this morning. You were given a sedative late last night. - I was told about the nightmare you had last night. - Is it still troubling you? - Yes. - [Gerald] Would you like to tell me about it? - You'll think I'm crazy. - I want to win your trust Jane. You should be able to tell me anything, I'll listen. - I need help. - Of course you do Jane and I want to help you. (eerie music) - Well you know I believe that my memory loss wasn't by accident, that it was taken from me surgically. The surgeon who took it is here. He was outside my window last night and he threw someone's head at me and I ran out to tell the nurse and he was there waiting for me. Calling me. You don't believe me. - I believe you saw it Jane, but the nurse and the orderly in the hall with you saw nothing. - Then I must be insane because he was as clear to me as you are now. - Not insane Jane, confused. Some of the doors in your mind are still closed. Probably because of that trauma you can't remember. I'd like to put you under hypnosis again. Maybe we can get at what's locked up in your subconscious. (bell chiming) (suspenseful music) Let's go back to the day you were found wandering in the park. How did you get there? - I walked to the park from the hospital. - What hospital? - I don't know. I only saw the inside of the operating room. The room where I had the operation. - Describe the room. - I'm laying on a table. I can't see the walls. And I'm cold, I'm cold. He doesn't want me to be afraid. - Who doesn't want you to be afraid? - The surgeon. I don't want this to happen to me. I don't want him to touch me. He smells like death, like formaldehyde. I can't stand the smell. - What does he look like? - I can't look at him. He's hideous. - How? - There's something wrong with his eyes and he's got a hole in his... (unnerving music) No. No! - Jane, Jane, snap out of it Jane, snap out of it. (unnerving music) (maniacal laughing) - You can never kill me Gerald. - What kind of trick are you playing on me? - No trick Gerald. You can never kill me. But I can kill you Gerald and I will through her. (maniacal laughing) (screaming) What happened? - Get out. Get out I said, get out! (chattering) Nurse Kygar I think you were right about Jane Doe. What's her sedative does? Well double that and put her on Thorazine. - [Kygar] Tonight? - Yes tonight. And Nurse Kygar keep her under strict observation. - As you say Doctor. (eerie music) - [Man] Happy birthday. - Nobody hurt my baby. - (crazily laughing) Nobody hurt my baby. Nobody hurt my baby. - [Chris] What do you want? - I need your help. I have to get out of here. - What's your hurry? - Please, I know I have nothing to offer but... - You're right about that, I've got enough problems. I want to know what you meant when you said Jessica wasn't coming back. - It was a feeling, I had a feeling. - Well she hasn't come back and now Bud's missing. Suddenly everyone in here is going ape shit and I want to know why. - It's the surgeon. - Surgeon? What are you talking about? - He killed a man last night, I saw him, he's here. He's the same one that took my memory from me. - You're a fucking nut. - Please listen to me, I know it sounds crazy, but I'm telling you the truth. - Alright I'm listening. (manic chattering) (chanting in a foreign language) - He's in that old building with the clock tower. I think he has people locked up in the cellar. Maybe even Nurse Robbins. (chanting in a foreign language) - You're right it sounds completely crazy. - Confess, confess! Death is near. From the valley of darkness the shadows draw near. Make your confession! (gasping) Confess. Confess! - Cat man. - I can't get it off. Come on, oh come on. - Alright, you and I are going to check out that building tonight. - I'm scared. - If any of what you say is true then I'll get both of us out of here, deal? - Okay. - Tonight, don't take your medication, don't swallow it. - You'll sleep well tonight. (suspenseful music) (gasping) - Are you ready? - It was hard to fake swallowing all these pills. - Jesus Christ. They've been giving you Thorazine, would've wiped you out. Come on we've got to hurry. (suspenseful music) - [Man On TV] Listen to the French, chapter six. If I'm guilty of the sin of avarice and greed and using others and coveting other's goods and Adam if you are you must repent because if you do not repent it will be everlasting death. If you die you will be dead and you will not rise again. Oh lord you must in heaven give us everlasting life. (suspenseful music) - I always knew this door would come in handy. - How are we gonna get it open? - I burrowed it from my bed frame, just like in all the prison movies. (groaning) (suspenseful music) (talking on TV) (rattling) (gasping) - You're going to isolation pal. (bell chiming) (suspenseful music) - Sara. (suspenseful music) - I'm gonna have to watch you more closely from now on Meyers. - Fuck you for that. Damn. (maniacal moaning) (suspenseful music) (crazily laughing) - Wait. (suspenseful music) (crazily laughing) (suspenseful music) (crazily laughing) Nurse Robbins? (suspenseful music) Where are you? (crazily laughing) (suspenseful music) Nurse Robbins why are you hiding from me? Terrible things are happening. - [Colin] I took your memory. Nurse Robbins wasn't so cooperative. - No, no. (laughing) (suspenseful music) (gasping) (rattling door) (banging on door) (suspenseful music) No. (suspenseful music) No. No. (suspenseful music) No. (screaming) (suspenseful music) (screaming) - [Colin] You're going to be my little secret. (laughing) (suspenseful music) (gasping) (screaming) (suspenseful music) (manic moaning) (banging on door) - I feel sick. (banging on door) I gotta get to a nurse. Real sick. - [Man] Yeah you don't look so good. - I feel like puking, I can't breath. Like I'm gonna puke. - I'll get the nurse. (thumping) (suspenseful music) (screaming) (moaning) (screaming) (suspenseful music) (screaming) (suspenseful music) - [Colin] Be a good girl while I'm gone. (suspenseful music) (manic moaning) - We're gonna get that motherfucker. (screaming) - Quiet. - So you been down to that new donut shop down the street, what's it called, The Donut Hole? - Yeah it's good, but I like The Universal Donut. They have apple. They're monstrous, they're great. - You mean the one with the brown kind of crispy covering? - Oh yeah, yeah. - And the black coffee, nothing like... (growling) - What the fuck? Get out of there, get out of there! (gun firing) (screaming) (suspenseful music) - [Kygar] Hold that there. - I can't reach anybody in security. I'm gonna have to go out and find that son of a bitch myself. - We're so short handed. I'm going to call Dr. Swan. - I'm not waiting. (phone ringing) - Yes? - Dr. Swan, thank god you're still here. - What is it Nurse Kygar? - I think you better come down. We have an orderly hurt. One of the patients broke out of Iso. - I'll be right there. - Thank you Doctor. (bell chiming) - Chris it's him. We have to get out of here. Those things are out there. We have to go. - It's impossible, calm down. He probably gave you a drug, it's alright. Wait, wait. (Shushing) (footstep thumping) I thought I heard something. (screaming) Bud what the fuck? (growling) - No. No! (thumping) (screaming) - Let's get the hell out of here. (banging) (eerie music) (crazily laughing) (knocking on door) - Who's in there? - [Robbins] I'll be right there Nurse Kygar. - Nurse Robbins where have you been? Open this door immediately. (door unlocking) (suspenseful music) (groaning) (suspenseful music) - Holy shit, there are more of those things. - I told you. - Come on let's get ourselves a ride. (suspenseful music) - [Gerald] Orderly. Nurse Kygar, where is she? - I think she went down the hall. (suspenseful music) (panting) - Damn the distributor's gone. For dead people they sure are smart. (screaming) (growling) (thumping) - They just keep coming on. - Let's get to the fence. (suspenseful music) (moaning) (knocking on door) - Nurse Kygar. (moaning) (knocking on door) Nurse Kygar are you alright in there? (moaning) (suspenseful music) (moaning) (gagging) (suspenseful music) (growling) (suspenseful music) (screaming) - We won't make it to the fence come on. (suspenseful music) (growling) (flesh tearing) (suspenseful music) - Can you open it? - No. It's locked. Oh no, somebody! (growling) (shouting) (screaming) (growling) (screaming) (growling) (thumping) (growling) - Stay away from me. Stay away from me! - Shut up. (growling) The line's dead. - Those things, those things they're because of her. She brought him back. - What are you talking about? - Today in hypnosis she spoke in his voice. Colin Ramzi is out there. - The surgeon, you know about him? - Bastard, you bastard! - Get her off, get her off. - It's alright, it's alright. Come on. Listen I want to know who the fuck this Ramzi is and what he has to do with those zombies out there. Now start talking Swan. (banging on door) (moaning) - I hadn't that of it in 20 years. (banging on door) (moaning) Colin Ramzi was, among other things, the most brilliant man I've ever met. He was doing research here into the organic causes of insanity. The linkage between the physical brain and the mind. And then somewhere along the way his genius twisted. He seemed seduced by death. He became something evil. (suspenseful music) I couldn't let anybody find out what he was doing. My career would've been over too. I sealed him up in his dead pit. His wife had left him, she'd taken the children. He didn't have any friends. There was nobody who wanted to investigate. Everybody just assumed he'd disappeared. It was easy. I made myself forget. - So he killed them and you killed him. That doesn't explain why they're alive now. - The earthquake, it opened the seal. - An earthquake is a natural phenomenon, this is supernatural. - [Gerald] Colin Ramzi has come back from the other side of death. He's come back for revenge. - And he's come for me. - Yes. He's using you, can't you see that? You broke the seal. - This is no time for psychoanalysis. They're swarming out there. If we don't come up with a plan soon we'll be buried in those dead things. - Someone's gotta stop him. I killed him once, I'll kill him again. Stay back, stay back. - With that gun we've all got a chance to make it. You can't leave us without a weapon Swan. - I have to do this and I have to do it by myself. (suspenseful music) (moaning) (gun firing) (suspenseful music) (growling) - They're following him. - Let's try to find a weapon upstairs. (bell chiming) (suspenseful music) (moaning) - [Jane] What are they doing? - They've got brains in their hands. (moaning) (growling) (screaming) (thumping) (moaning) (chanting in a foreign language) (growling) (shouting in a foreign language) (screaming) He's dead. - Where did you get that? - Holy water, holy water kills the beasts. - Where can we get more of this holy water Sister? - Any water's holy if it's blessed. Can holy water stop what's happening here? Stop him? - The place where the beast rises must be washed clean. The desecrated grounds must be made holy. - She's talking about the pit. Putting holy water in the pit. - Can you bless water Sister? - I do the prayer. God does the blessing. (dramatic music) - Can you bless all the water in that tower Sister? All of it. - If it is God's will. (bell chiming) (suspenseful music) - [Colin] How about you get in the pit Gerald? (laughing) (gun firing) (laughing) (moaning) You're flawed Gerald. I'm going to open you up and see what the problem is. (laughing) (eerie music) - If we can get to the machine shops near the tower. I should be able to find enough material to make a bomb. - You can do that? - Oh it's my specialty I'm afraid. If my thinking is correct that tank can be felled so it falls directly into the south wing of the clock tower building. It'll crack open beautifully. And a hell of a lot of water will go into the basement, into the pit. - I want to watch him die. I know when that happens I'll remember who I am. - Please. Please don't cut me. - [Colin] The brain is a parasite Gerald. It attaches to the mind and gives us physical form. - Don't cut my brain. - [Colin] The brain is the destroyer. The brain is the clock that kills us. (tool whirring) (screaming) (suspenseful music) - I found another weapon we can use. - Cartridges. I can use this gun powder as detonator. (suspenseful music) (goofily laughing) - Oh. Oh. (chanting in a foreign language) - Omnipotent. Glorious. (Speaking in a foreign language) Amen. Where for I bless thee oh pitcher of water, God by the holy, God by the true, God by the omnipotent. (suspenseful music) (laughing) (moaning) (groaning) - [Colin] We've just begun Gerald, just begun. - It's not fancy, but it should be enough to sever one of the trust joints at the top of the water tower. - Does it have to be placed on the top? - I'm afraid so, but don't worry, I've set a long enough fuse. And once I'm up there I can set it, light it, have enough time to get down before it blows. It'll be close. (growling) (screaming) (growling) (gun firing) Wait! (screaming) That was Jensen.
