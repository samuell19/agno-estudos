This Is the village of Bakhtia in Siberia. Although it fooks like winter fo us, it's already spring here. The village is Jocated in the heart of Siberia... and we should keep in mind that this colossal landmass... ls one and a half times the size of the United States. The endless wilderness that surrounds this place is known as the tajga. No roads or train lines traverse it. There are only two ways to reach this outpost- one ls by helicopter, the other by boat. The expanse in the foreground ls not solid ground... but the frozen-over Yenisey River... one of the largest waterways in Siberia. It is only during the few ice-free months of summer... that boats can also reach Bakhlia. Of the 300 or so inhabitants of this village... a handful of them make their livelihood as professional frappers. One of these men is Gennady Solovyev. Here he makes his way info the wilderness... across an enormous frozen river He wants fo show us an essential tool of his profession. This Is the best time of the year... for Gennadly fo find the perfect piece of wood... for the making of his all-important skis. The ice covering the river ls stilf solid... making it easy fo travel the vast distances... the trappers need fo prepare for their work. Unlike sport hunting... preparation for professional trapping ls a year-round job. This ls Anatoly Blume. He's tending one of his hunting cabins. Here, he removes the winter snow so that the roof will not cave in. Firewood must be collected now so that it can dry during the summer. Each hunter has a base hut... and a number of additional outlying huts that need fo be maintained. All the provisions here have fo be secured against bears. They don't use glass for the windows... as glass ls easily broken during transportation or by bears. These are the claw marks made by one of them. In spring, with the sun higher upon the horizon... the snow becomes wet and river water seeps through the ice. Here, Gennadly builds one of his traps... in the same simple manner they have been builf for ages. Gennady marks the location of his frap... so he can find it at the beginning of the hunting season. His territory comprises of some 1,500 square kilometers. This area was consigned to him during Communist times... when he trapped for the state. The hunters return fo the village. Here, the kids enjoy a last chance at ice-skating before the thaw. May 1 marks a big day for Russia. It is their tradlitional Labor Day and marks the end of the winter. Winter is burnt in effigy. The appearance of the first geese flying north... ls a sure sign of spring. This is followed quickly by May 9th, Victory Day— The day the German army surrendered... bringing an end fo the Second World War. This marks an event of epochal proportions in Russian history... as more than 20 million Russians lost their lives in this war. Every family lost someone. This sign marks a residence of a veteran, a war hero. Overwhelmed by memories of the war, he can no longer speak. As if responding fo the shots fired in celebration... the ice of the Yenisey River begins fo break. An entire landscape starts to move north... towards the Arctic Ocean. Spring is the time to build dugout canoes. This man, Gennady Tiganov... belongs to the Ket native population of this part of Siberia. He is their last remaining expert boat builder. Tools and fechniques being used are all traditional, It is essential to hollow out the precise amount and no more. Markings point out the positions of dowels which will be driven info the hull. From the inside, this tells the boat maker how deep he can carve. One of the last steps is the widening of the canoe. Exposing the body to heat makes the shape of the canoe permanent What remains is a layer of tar The hunters head out to test their new canoes with some fishing and duck hunting. This week-long expedition ls also the first time... these pups are being taken out into the wilderness. The nets have been out overnight.. And, by morning, ice has formed around them. But it's a good time of year for catching pike and other fish. The most delicate fish will be smoked for the season fo come. Summer brings an abundance of life. This is a sable in short summer fur. Come winter, it will be the main quarry of the trappers. Even though the hunter does not want to go for the reindeer... his dog can't help but give chase. He has no chance, but try he must. Preparations are in full swing for the upcoming trapping season. This means stocking up on as much fish as you can catch... to feed both man and dog. Some of the pike can be real specimens. Negotiating the shallows of the river becomes a real problem. the propeller has to be protected Summer is the season for the hunters fo help each other build new cabins. The real challenge are the mosquitoes— clouds of them. The hunters are so seff-reliant that they make virtually everything themselves. Chain saws are one of the few modern tools they use. As there is no corner drugstore... the hunters have to make their own insect repelent. The bark of birch trees can be processed... to produce a far which is equally as effective out there. Gennady now resumes the making of his skis. He puts the tip of the plank into boiling water for a few hours... in order fo make if pliable. He passes this age-old technique on to his son. From further upriver comes driftwood. The villagers gather it as free firewood for the winter. The few remaining Ket people earn money this way. It's one of the few menial jobs left for them. They have largely forgotten their traditional craftsmanship... and most of them have problems with alcohol Only a single old Ket woman is left who still remembers the old ways. These mysterious dolls are protective spirits. During day, they sleep... but at night they awaken to guard the home. That night, her son is careless with a cigarette but... And their house catches fire. Yet, another loss is more painful for him. Summer in it's fullest display— swallows, boats. Daylight lasts 20 hours. This is the time when big ships show up... some of them even tourist cruisers. It's gardening season. Greenhouses are being fixed and manure spread With the days so abundantly long... vegetables grow here at an incredible rate. One of the first signs that the short summer is coming to an end... ls the chipmunks out collecting pine nuts. Humans do the same in their own way. The trappers can estimate from the number of cones... whether it's going to be a good hunting year or not... as the nuts are a staple food for the sable. Grinding the cones makes it easier to get the nuts... which provide another food source for the hunters during the winter. Pouring the grounds into the wind.. is similar fo separating the wheat from the chaff. Now the first rains start. Summer will soon be over. So while the river is still navigable... a strange visitor arrives with company. It is a candidate seeking reelection. For four years, people in Bakhtia have not seen a single politician caring for them... but, here now, there is one campaigning vigorously for their votes. He promises transparent government and the expunging of corruption- a clean leadership once and for all. But he does not fall to deliver the goods anyway- sacks of wheat for his constituency and even a little show. Only the young people seem to be able to get into the groove. And now the candidate bursts out in song himseff.. Backed by his cheerleaders. The voters, apparently, couldn't care less. Fall has arrived. It is time to harvest... and begin serious preparations for the fast-approaching cold. Days grow short, and fishing ls good now. At night, the trappers go out onto the river. Every type of fish has its specific time when if comes close to the shore. The only species of freshwater cod can be stalked now... using almost prehistoric tools. The light of the fire attracts the fish. Storms from the north suddenly set in. The clouds carry rain that falls for weeks... and this is important for the hunters. The level of the river rises... and now they can transport their heavy gear into the wilderness. The most important things, like bread, are loaded fast. The trappers order bread in advance from the bakery. Half a loaf per day will do. And now comes the moment of departure. The occasion is celebrated with vodka— vicious as jet fuel, Now out on their own... the trappers become what they essentially are— happy people. Accompanied only by their dogs, they live off the land. They are completely self-reliant. They are truly free. No rules, no taxes, no government... no laws, no bureaucracy. No phones, no radio. Equipped only with their individual values and standard of conduct. Mikhail Tarkovsky— from the family of the famous filmmaker— Knows what it takes fo live out here. And the first thing is to be able to navigate the river in high water. Anatoly Blume sets out on a different tributary of the Yenisey... and Gennady and his son on their respective branch of the river. It's tough going. In some places, the rapids are so strong... that the outboard motor cannot overcome the current. So you have to have these long ropes. Sometimes even the two of us cannot drag it against the current. It's a very hard river to run. The rapids are so strong that you can only cover 25 to 30 kilometers a day. Gennady's son sets out for his own territory further upriver. 'Every man has his own destiny, his own plan, his own territory”.. Says Gennady in a pensive mood. At this time of year, the bears are still around... posing a threat fo the trappers' provisions. Bears are the real enemy of the trappers... wreaking all kinds of havoc to both hut and trap. Gennady rewards his dogs with the neck and feet of the Woodcock For now, the river still flows free... but the first signs of frost are appearing. The trappers rush to catch as much pike as they can... mostly for their dogs. Mikhail has his own unorthodox fishing techniques. The bears are no longer arouna, having gone off info hibernation. Provisions now can be stored within easy reach. The only threat are mice... and the plastic will prevent them from getting up the tree. The onslaught of ice puts Mikhail's boat in jeopardy. It's time to secure it for the winter. Mikhail uses a different, more recognizable type of traditional trap. The branches protect the trap from getting snowed over. The enormity of solitude sets in. His only companion is his dog. Back in the village. Like the trappers out in the taiga... the villagers must also be completely self-refiant. Because no supplies can be brought in during the winter... they must make everything they need by hand. Temperatures have dropped by now below minus 50 degrees... and the days are growing short. The Yenisey River ls completely frozen over... but still provides fish in abundance. Out in the taiga... Gennady negotiates his territory along his frozen tributary. From here, he will branch out to hunt sable. The traps are laid out along loops... that take a day to travel. This way, he can safely reach one of his outlying huts by nightfall. The triggering device of his trap... ls a primitive yet sophisticated mechanism. Hundreds of kilometers away is Anatoly's hut. He is in the middle of his trapping season. While we see that he has no shortage of fish... It is conspicuous how little he gives his dog for breakfast. The snowmobile is another one of the few modern conveniences they employ... but in this terrain, it has its limits. Continuing his rounds on skis... he resembles prehistoric man from a diistant ice age. Day in, day out— it is the same routine of hard work in severe conditions. But out here, the trapper is one of the few... to witness the beauty of space, cold and silence. Imagine, after being exhausted at the end of a hard day... you are coming home to this. In the little remaining daylight, he cannot possibly return to his main hut. His only recourse is to fix this one. Because Anatoly spent much of the next day repairing his outlying hut... it takes him until nightfall to find his way back to his base hut. It is the last day of December... and unusually mild at 33 degrees below zero. Anatoly, like all the other trappers... will return to the village for New Year's Eve. The voyage is 150 kilometers along the frozen river... and we should note that Anatoly's dog never rides on the snowmobile. He covers the entire distance running behind. At night, he is still running. Finally, the village of Bakhtia comes into view. And here comes the dog. For Gennady and all of them, this is a happy return. Christmas is celebrated in Russia on January 6. The entire village participates. The stay for the trappers will be a short one. After a few days and nights... they will return to the taiga for the remaining months of winter. This is the life they love.
