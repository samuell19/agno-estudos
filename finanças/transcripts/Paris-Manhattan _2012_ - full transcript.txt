I first saw a Woody Allen film when I was 15. We got on well straightaway. At first, we met once a year, then he entered my room and my life. Can one be so immoral as to sleep with one's wife's sister? Is everything permitted? Could this kind of immorality happen to me? Without the law, it's all darkness... Look, Mom! This one's magnificent! I love it. Try it on. Really? Well? I'm going. We haven't found your outfit yet. Is an outfit for Saturday all you're interested in, Mom? Don't be so aggressive. Mom just wants you to look more feminine. - Who asked you? - Don't be so rude. Whatever! Leave her alone. No matter what you do, you'll still be my daughter. Great! I'll take this. It's my mother's treat! I'll take this, too. Your sister's weird. An aspirin, quick! My ears are bleeding, too. Makes a change from Cole Porter! You like him? I'm in a jazz group. I love jazz! I'm also studying engineering. And you? Me? Oh, I'm in college. These shoes hurt my feet. I'm sick of it! Let me see. Alice... Let's go. Hélène, my sister. Pierre. Pleased to meet you. I'll kill her! No, I know! I'll drown her, then myself! Right, let's stay positive. I'm a spoiled brat who's received so much love, so what if she steals my dream man? What're you talking about? I'm immortal! 2 years later... How are you? What're you doing? You're not ready yet? I'm coming. What is it? You look so sad, it's hiding your beauty. Come on, hurry up. Yes, Dad. I wonder if life's worth living. For example? And the smile of my sister in love. 10 years later... Here. Anything else? Free ride The present day... - Hello, Alice. - Hello. Don't miss the Woody Allen retrospective. Pharmacist - the ideal job for a mother. - Do the school run... - Go away when I want. And not be dependent on the husband I don't have! You're the boss from now on. I liked being the boss's daughter. I was happy here. I hope you will be, too. What if I'm not up to it? Maybe Dad's wrong to trust me. Yes. You often mention him. I thought he was a relative of yours. Work and sex... Oh, look. Magnificent! Let me just grab a cherry. Want one? No, thanks, darling. There they are. How are you? How's business? I've nearly cut a deal with Forma. Well done, Vincent. Thanks. Have you been on vacation? South Africa. For our 15th anniversary. - So, it's a lie, what they say? - What? - That marriage is hard. - Depends on luck. With Hélène, my life is like "Rhapsody in Blue"! With my ex, it was like the end of "Apocalypse Now"! Do not touch. Danger You have a bad cough. It'll go. Yes, straight to the bronchial tubes. Pneumonia always starts with a little cough, then... Are you a doctor? No, but my daughter's a pharmacist. Go and see her. She'll soon cure you of your pneumonia. - Do you have a card? - I'll get it. Goal! What about Vincent? Not the right type. Why not? He's nice, very bright. Not his type. Have you seen your father? No. He's recruiting for Alice. Again? He's unbelievable! He just wants me married off. Mom, he stole my business cards again. Please talk to him. He shouldn't, but we worry about you. Yes, we want to see you happy. I am happy- Where has he got to? I want you to meet my friend, Vincent Bismuth. You have more single friends? I thought I'd tried 'em all! We were inseparable. Everyone took us for brothers. Give him my number now! I watched "Manhattan" again. It's so good. Sure. Why do you like Woody Allen? He's not the only funny guy. He makes me laugh the most. My dear, forgive me for butting in, but I thought that the film hadn't aged well. - I fell asleep before the end. - I agree. It does go round in circles at the end. Forgive me. The film hasn't aged - you must take more sleeping pills! No! Alcohol and pills don't go together. Who is she? The... No idea, sir. But she's very rude. Alice OVITZ Pharmacist Wait, I'll go with you. I'll just get my coat. It's OK, I called a taxi. Did you get his license number? What? I'm entitled to worry with all the things you hear. - Go on, then. - I'll call you. At last! I need to talk to you. Do you have to? What? That was the President of the Bar! Do I deserve the death penalty? Oh, it's easy for you, isn't it? - You're accountable to nobody. - Meaning? The pharmacy didn't fall in my lap. See you on Monday. OK. Are all lawyers such ass lickers? I'm going to kill you! Yeah, kill me! Grow up! - Goodnight. - 'Night. - I'll wait with you. It's wiser. - No need. I'm used to going home alone. It only takes one time... People today are tempted by serial killing. It's an easy route to celebrity. You sound like my dad. A charming man. You know him? We met at the party. Did he ask for your phone number? No, he asked a guy with pneumonia. Oh, right. Odd families aren't rare. You have one, too? Mine are pathologically discreet. Grandma's 102, Grandpa's 106. Even God's forgotten about them. When He realizes, He'll take it out on my generation. My name is Victor Blanc. Alice Ovitz. I know. Single pharmacist to be married off. Goodnight. No! I'll take you home. Do you know the Taiebs, tonight's hosts? Not really. They're my brother-in-law's friends. DO you? Just business. You're in finance? No. I installed their alarms. You're "Do not touch. Danger"? Yes, it gives you an electric shock of 3,000 volts. Did you design the electric chair, too? - So, you like Woody Allen? - Pardon? I saw your little number earlier. No laughing matter! He was talking nonsense. How do you know? Maybe the author would agree. No. OK, case dismissed. Funny, I've never seen his films. Not one. What, never? No. - Never? - Otherwise clean record! Should I take you to the hospital? Why Woody Allen? Why, what? Why Woody Allen and not Charlie Chaplin? 'Cause he's handsome. OK, you won't answer. I respect that. Those parties bore me. Why do you 90'? For the wine. And you? I may have sold an alarm to your dad and the Plaza. Why do you 90'? You said so before: to find a husband. Why get married? To stop going home by taxi. No, it's to stop being alone. But you will be. We all are. What an optimist! No, a realist. Nothing lasts, especially love. Nothing lasts? Nothing, except death. Oh, stop it. I'm sleeping alone tonight. My happy family'd put color in your cheeks! I don't believe in happiness. It was invented by a guy with no business sense. I don't believe in unhappiness. I try, but I just can't. Want a lift? You're quite unusual. I know. It's the only art I managed to cultivate. Well? No, thanks. I'd rather walk. 'Night. No... It's Laura. "Desire for order is a desire for death." Kundera. Fire the maid! Philosophical differences! Very funny. Laura, tidy your room and stop this. You'd see clearer in a mess, Mom. Just tidy your room. Tidy, tidy! I'll do the same tomorrow. The Habitat stool is dead. Who wants some tea? Yes, please. No. What's going on? Is it 'cause of her boyfriend? She won't even let us meet him. This rogues' gallery doesn't represent our values. Don't worry, she's strong. I'm not so sure. You're working too hard. I have since she was born. It's all my fault. A trip to Brittany will perk us up. - Hello, Mrs Gozlan. - Hello, Alice. Going away this weekend? Who with? My two boys? One in the USA, the other in Belgium. Well, that's life. I'll send you on a trip. Try these. Thank you. You should get married. Hey, Taieb's electric alarm is playing up. The maid fainted. Is it serious? Is she OK? Yeah, no problem. You'll be pleased though - you've got a new client. A private home? A pharmacy. Here... Ovitz, in the 4th district. What did you say? Ovitz. Know it? Yeah. A girl I walked home the other night. Things are going well! That's what you think. Compared to her, quantum mechanics is simplicity itself! Exactly. Keep it simple. For once. - You OK? - Great! I talk to myself, I wake up, thinking I'm dying, and I make my loved ones feel guilty. Otherwise fine. Incredible! My father has exactly the same symptoms. The top specialists all gave him the same verdict: "You're Jewish!" I'm not Jewish - I'm an atheist. That's very Jewish! I'm depressed. I need a pick-me-up. My treatment: Watch these to excess morning, noon, and night. If they don't help, come back. Is it true? You cured Mrs Fauvet's heartburn with Lubitsch? So they say, but hush! The local doctors don't approve. If it works, I'll send my friends. Thank you. I suppose you don't have a prescription... We can eat out without you buying my alarm. What? It was me. I called him. 2 local pharmacies robbed this month. We already have an alarm. They did, too. You need one with chloroform. You had lunch? She doesn't eat. Chloroform? Let me explain. If there's a suspicious noise, the alarm releases chloroform. In 30 seconds, everyone's asleep. After electrocuting Taieb, you want to asphyxiate us? I have work to do. It's very different. Are you sure it's safe? You can't be sure of anything. The red button rings my office. We respond within 10 minutes. Are you listening? Sure. Green triggers the chloroform. But beware, it's only in the front, so stay down behind the counter. It's ridiculous. I'll just give the takings to a thief. What? You smell good. That the best you can do? I bought a film by your pal. Really? Which one? The one with "sex" in. Of course! And did you like it? I haven't watched it yet. Is it good? It may be a bit too subtle and demanding for you. Funny and moving would be lost on me? Why did I say that? I'm sorry. Have you had lunch? Why did you say that? I don't know. And lunch with you? No. You won't eat with me? No. Sex maybe... Your father's right. You need to eat. Delicious. What'd you like now? Nothing you can give me. Dine with Woody Allen? You like him. A ride with him in Central Park... Done! Next to you, Louis XIV was a communist! Why do you like Allen? He speaks to me. To me, too. - Yeah? - I'm a fan. He's a great philosopher and Talmudist. He makes us more intelligent laughing than yawning. Why take photos of themselves? Like Cole Porter? It's so annoying. They look... I adore Cole Porter! Don't move. How did it go with Vincent? Do you like him? Yeah. Why didn't you introduce us before? He was married. Married? Why didn't he tell me? Maybe it's hard for him to talk about. - The alarm man's here. - Victor? I asked him to bring the invoice. Good evening. - Set another place, Mom. - I have. - 'Evening. - Give me your... - I can't stay. - You must! She'd be better off with someone like that Victor. She may be original, but she's still your sister. Meaning? Vincent suits her. I have to make a call. Good you came. You'll see, we exude joy and serenity. Family serenity? A big mess snoozing, more like! We're heavy sleepers. Not eating with us, Laura? - I'm going out. - On a Friday night? See you! She has a good survival instinct. Let's go. Dinner's ready! Your mother has natural authority. Will she beat me if I'm bad? - Do you practice? - I'm an atheist. - You don't respect tradition? - No. It's just an illusion of eternity. I believe there's a start and an end. Right... Let's enjoy our meal before the world ends! Not that, too! Nicole! What can I do? Calm down, you two. Who's good with electricity? I think everyone's affected. You can dine in the dark in Paris. - Should we start? - Let's eat. You used cardamom? - You don't like it? - I do. It's tasty. Do you cook? I get by. Hélène has no time to cook. She's a top lawyer. She's a killer. Are you happy? No! You don't like it there? I defend crooks who are victims of a rotten system while my daughter goes astray. Pull yourself together. Laura's fine. - Who wants some bread? - Yes, please. What do you do, Pierre? I'm in finance. I'm very happy. What? When we met, you wanted to be a musician. Victor was right, everyone was affected. What's wrong with Laura? You worry me. She's been seeing this boy for a year. - Achille. - Yes. Why won't she let us meet him? I'm sure he's very nice. 20-year-olds don't drive SUVs. Why not? Listen... What if he's a dealer? - A dealer? - Yes, a dealer. No, he's just a poor little rich kid. Going without Hélène? I have a business meeting. She's going home alone? She knows. Thank you. Bye. Will you walk Alice home? With pleasure. You never took your driving test? No. Walking and cycling stimulate my creativity. And my legs! So, Pierre cheats on Helene? He's not very classy. Such bourgeois banality! You never noticed? Hello? Hélène wasn't on form tonight. She's worried about Laura's boyfriend. Don't worry, it's nothing. I do worry. My daughter's unhappy - I worry. You "Yiddishe Mama", you! No-one's good at everything. You have to choose between work and life. No way! Luckily her husband isn't old-fashioned. Don't try to do to her what you did to me. She said she wanted to look after her family more. No. She's just a bit tired. After two days in a kitchen, she'd get depressed. I'm on tranquilizers. Who'd have raised our girls with you working? We had no family to help us. We could've managed. I was a good lawyer. What would our life have been like? Helene works non-stop, Pierre cheats on her. Is that what you'd have wanted? Yes, Pierre! Your beloved son-in-law! He cheats on Hélène. Do you have any proof? Or are you just assuming it? It's normal to be wrong about loved ones. Everyone's complex. Even your banal brother-in-law. I don't want to be original. - So, why are you single? - I'm not. Good! You'll have a nice depressing life like Helene! At least I'm going for a ride. It's only worth doing if you ride as a couple, no? He's not cheating on her. They love each other. It's obvious. Why would he, huh? She's gorgeous. She's brilliant, intelligent, does Pilates. You know, the new version of yoga with added Kamasutra. I don't want to know. It's too painful. There's a problem with the current. Take a look. - Shunted the bypass? - Sure. - Ovitz's pharmacy! - Call the cops! And the cash! Hurry up! Take this, too. Breath pastilles. And... Hairspray! Watch out. Hello. A packet of sanitary napkins, please. No, XXL! And cough mixture. What's this shit? Think of his unhappy childhood! Take the Money & Run, Manhattan Murder Mystery, Bullets over Broadway. Come with me. Quick! This way. Good luck. - Thank you very much. - Goodbye. Are you OK? You pushed the... Shit! The chloroform. Nice little place. It smells good. What is it? The candle. Tuberose. Here, put this behind your back. Lie down. OK? I'll make some tea. Don't stay, 'cause you half-killed me. It's your invention. Do you think you'll change that man's life with 3 DVDs? Yes. They changed mine. Not that one. Rosemary. You don't believe in God, but you do in plants. It develops my... ...creativity. I know. Don't justify yourself. You can wear pink shirts. Hi, Mom. Pink shirts? What is it? What's wrong? You scared me. Laura doesn't need a babysitter. Of course you can go out. OK, bye, Mom. My family are so anxious! Pierre and Hélène are away, Laura... Let's go. - Take your tools. - Where to? Come on, Isaac. Get up. Don't waste time. Where are my black sneakers? I'm not going. And you're going nowhere. Here they are. What'll you do now? Put shoe polish on your face? My shades will suffice! Nicole! Taking its pulse? It's a great lock. I don't want the mechanism to suffer. Think it can feel pain? Turn that off! The neighbors might see... Find anything? It's a shoe. Don't look at it as if it's a family secret. This weapon's for walking? I like Grandma in the living room. It's not funny. She kept this quiet. Why? It'd suit you. Really? - What're you doing? - Trying it on. I never have time when I'm shopping. Now's the time. Full volume! She on coke? Cocaine! She gets veg from an organic kibbutz. Well? Interesting. She's hiding her tracks I'll find it. You'll find nothing. I'll check the study. I'll search his trouser pockets. Good idea. - Well? - No. You? No. It's stifling. Global warming starts here. If we find evidence he's cheating on her, what then? Quiet! I can't see a thing. Hang on... Turn that light off! I'm a bit hungry. I'll make a club sandwich. Wow! Don't we look good? Where was it taken? In Corsica, I think. Want a club sandwich? You can't eat fatty food. You can't break into your daughter's house at night. Whatever. I'm investigating. Well, you investigate. I hope they have pickles. I always forget that. I don't like it one little bit. You hide under beds! I want to hear what they say. What do you think of Victor? Well? It's too soon to say, but he's very handsome. Compared to that dermatologist, he's a Greek god! Yves - my, he was ugly! Yes, but he got rid of her verrucas. True. Isn't she a pretty kid? Look. Just like her mother. And that shipowner... Are they listing them? - Are there many? - No. The one who adored Alice? No, not the dentist. The shipowner. To look at you, you all seem so normal. Meaning? You're all crazy! Hey, that's enough! It's easy to criticize. I can criticize, too. Where's your family? Want to meet my mom? Yeah, sure. Are your brothers married? I have two sisters. There! I knew it. That explains it! - What? - Everything. What're you doing here? Same as you, but not in a bed. Find any clues? Mom, it's just not done! Your dad and I are worried. It's terribly hot in here. Who wants a drink? Or a club sandwich? It's not what you think. So, is he cheating on her or not? Yes. I feel so relieved. Mind you, I knew it. Has your mother been a drinker long? Leave my family alone! What next? My father wears dresses! No, he wears his madness on his face, like you. You're not the most dangerous. Maybe the most interesting. Thanks! And your madness? I know nothing about you. But she must've been a real bitch... Why are all these people here? C'mon, I love being massaged! No, it's like having your head in the toilet! Stop making such a fuss! Isn't it supposed to do you good? They have ways of making you talk! Carole Bels... Who? The bitch who left me for my best friend. Ouch! - Thanks. - It was great. How's your brother-in-law's clone? He's a dream! Handsome, kind... He likes art, he's athletic... I couldn't ask for more. He sounds like a god. Does he? Really? Careful... Gods don't love - they just let you love them. OK, I'm coming. - You came! - To kiss you before I leave. - When? - Tomorrow. Tomorrow?! For how long? A week. Come with me. But what would my customers do without me? As my wife, you won't have time to play nurse. Pharmacist! Sorry. Pharmacist, OK. It doesn't make sense. You don't leave this lying around. Why not? You're splitting hairs, as usual. Story of your life. Doesn't make sense. Thank you. Off you go. Hello. I've come for the chloroform canister. - Alice Ovitz? - Yes. Sign here, please. Thanks, bye. Back on Monday Cole Porter - not very original! I think it's sweet. Makes me feel like shopping. Coming? When you're happy, you go shopping? Yes, Arthur? Yeah, I'm on my way. I'll call you back. Your little secret? It's not what you think. OK, so, I'm not your type... It's not mine! Are we going shopping or what? Coming. Charline?! I won't stop work to raise kids. Will we have many? I love my work. It's very important to me. Who says you have to stop? You're the boss, you decide. Do you like that? You can do both. Nice voice. That the best you can do? Just a sec. There's a call waiting. I'll phone you back. Can you hear me? I can't speak loud. Meet me at Le Château Hotel. Immediately! Right now? What's going on? You have my number? I have your fax, email, and cellphone. Your father's very thoughtful. Where are you? On the toilet. Ever read "Belle du Seigneur"? Enough already! I'll be right there. Be quick. I had a meeting here to show the hotel my paralyzing alarm. At their age, the guests don't need it! - Let me finish. - Why are we hiding? 'Cause of you, I forgot my keys. I saw them arm in arm... Pierre! Your idol with that lady. I don't understand. Who's that woman with him? He said he was out of town. A doctor and a sheep shouldn't go together, but they did. Why mention that film now? She's Pierre's sheep. Who knows why he's attracted to a woman like that? Love and sex can be very mysterious. Yet it's... I knew something was wrong with that card. You hid it so I wouldn't be hurt? Yes. I'll get my keys. I won't be long. Mom... - Come in. - What...? - I'll put her to bed. - Mom? Are you OK? Well? She won't face up to the problem. She won't get help. - I should go. - No, stay. How is it possible, Dad? It started as social drinking. We went to a lot of parties. Then... I guess old wounds rose to the surface. Darling... Dad... You once asked why Woody Allen mattered to me. At 15, I thought Cole Porter was a brand of jeans! Really? He showed me the truth. What truth? The one you can touch with your eyes closed. I understand. You can belong to a group whilst remaining apart but... my mother, my sister, that woman at the hotel... He didn't tell me that. I wasn't prepared for it. I understand. That the best you can do? You're wrong. He did prepare you for it. His movies are all about that. Couples who fight, who love each other, who cheat... Life. Your dreams are banal. Reality offers better than that. I told you I'm not looking for originality. My dreams may be banal, but I believe in them. Apart from your doors, alarms, and locks, what do you believe in? I didn't see what was there. I don't have that talent. It's time I had some. You're a darling! Don't forget the olives. One more lap. Come on, run. The worst is over. I'll get the young lady's coffee. Here are your DVDs. Thanks, I don't need them anymore. Keep them. Thanks. Coffee? Sure. Where do we meet? Where? Spell it. 8 PM. You look beautiful. Perfect! Love you. There's no alcohol. There's grapefruit juice. A tonic? I'm off. I don't like you going out on a Friday night. It's an exception. We're celebrating our first anniversary. What's that watch? A gift from Achille. - Give it back. - What? Don't accept such valuable gifts. If you insist, Mom. 'Evening. Have fun. Not too late now. - What? - Don't you see she's in trouble? This Achille seems very nice. Have you met him? - No. - Well, then! We haven't met him, Nicole! What? Helene thinks he's a dealer 'cause of his SUV. He must be a bit older than her. An old pervert! I hadn't thought of that. - C'mon... - That takes the biscuit! I think I'm needed in the kitchen. Thanks! Everything's fine. Hélène! Let's take a look at the pervert. What're you doing? There! We'll take your car. It's hot in your car. It's like your place - an oven. There's a problem with the central heating. But how do you know? Just saying. Want some? No, thanks. That's mine! Where did you find it? I can explain. Victor and I went there to see if Pierre was unfaithful. - What? - We found nothing. You broke in? Yes, but we were worried sick. Who's "We"? Us and our parents. You lot are crazy! That's a disgusting thing to do! Like you two and a whore! Don't tell me our parents saw us at hotel! Not our parents - Victor and me. How could you? What about you? SP3/ing on Laura! But Laura's my daughter! She's a minor! You're their daughter. It's the same. I was so shocked. - I shocked you? - Yes. You don't even dare live with anyone! I'm talking about morals. That was my own private Idaho. You had no right, do you hear? It's your life. I'm not happy with your happiness. You know what? I think it's for your own good. Hélène, wait! We're sisters. We'll make up in the end, so let's do it now. What about you and Vincent? I don't know. And Victor? Victor? Don't talk nonsense! - What? - Nonsense! Why? Victor's great! Yes, but... Get down! What's he like? I didn't see him. I'll follow them. No! You're crazy. If she sees you, she'll kill you! Why does Laura terrorize me so? Stop freaking out. Just don't lose touch. Oh, I won't make the same mistake twice. Look! - What? - Look. They're so cute! Yeah. I was silly. - Is it finished? - Looks like it. What's special about it? Nothing. It works. Good. Call a locksmith, not me. I can try and help, but... OK, I'm on my way. Alright. - Someone's inside? - It's been 40 minutes. How did it happen? The lock's been tampered with. You're the third locksmith. What amateurs! Let's call the fire department. You called me. Let me try. It looks complicated. They sure weren't pros! - Alice Ovitz? - Yes. Sign here, please. Thanks. Bye. "The Orient Express departs at 9 PM for Venice. Your gondola awaits." Venice, the standard destination for lovers. I brought your DVD back. I didn't like it. A doctor who falls in love with a sheep. Ridiculous! Anyway... It's my favorite film. I love that sheep, too. Gondolas make me seasick. Alice, I'm at the Plaza. I was with Woody Allen in his room. Get over here fast before he leaves. Right now? Alright. I'm on my way. Woody Allen's at the Plaza with Victor. He told me to go there. How can I help you? Go right away! It may be your only chance to meet him. Yes, you're right. What'll I say to him? You'll see, but hurry. He won't wait forever! That I love him? We've nothing in common! Isn't he a bit too old for you? You can't go like that. - You're beautiful! - Now run along. Thanks! - How do I get there? - On this. Hurry! GK, Aunty? Yes. Why're you here? I'm with Achille. He just ran a red light! Ahmed knows the President. Achille's a part-time chauffeur. Ahmed gives us lots of gifts. Cool! - And I give him guitar lessons. - Great! Thanks! You just missed him. Why didn't you take a taxi? - I love you angry! - Pity... And your little sheep's face! But that's... ...the best I can do!
