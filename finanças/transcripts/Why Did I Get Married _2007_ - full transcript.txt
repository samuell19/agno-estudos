OK. Let's do it. - Come on. - Mike. - No, no. Come on. Talk to me. - Calm down. - Eat your food, OK? - No, no. No. Let him talk. Let him talk, Shelia. She's just a little drunk. Yeah. You know what, Marcus? I may be a little drunk but somebody at this table got some damn secrets. - Really? - That's enough. No, no, no. Dianne... somebody got some secrets. What are they? You know, I'm so sick of this. I'm sick of it. The reason she can't go with this man or any other man is because she's sleeping with yours, Shelia. What? No. Yeah, Shelia. Oh, hell. Well, y'all, thanks for dinner. But I should be going. I think you need to stay, man. We're gonna need some law enforcement around here. I'm sorry. Is it true? Yeah. Yeah, it's true. That's my secret. I'm the bad guy. I'm not the only married person with a secret at this table. Terry... have you told your wife how you got a DNA test on your daughter, 'cause you weren't sure that she was yours? Mike, don't go telling secrets, man. Oh, no, no. Come on, Marcus. Y'all talking about me. Hmm? You put my secret out there. Let's put everybody's secret on the table, shall we? Dianne, have you told your husband that you got your tubes tied after you had Kenya and didn't tell him? Hmm? That's what Shelia told me. I'm sorry, Terry, but your chances of having a boy? - A little slim to none. - Mike, wait. This has gone too far. You are getting really dangerous now. You need to stop this. Gavin. Since you guys are walking around here like the perfect couple. Will you please inform your wife how you came crying at my house asking, "How could she be so stupid "and not strap your son in his car seat?" Hmm? - What about that? - You are a lowdown, dirty bastard... - Shut up! - No. You shut up! - Marcus, please. Please. - Oh, hell. Please tell this woman the truth. And I pray that it sets you free. I pray, brother. But I'm telling you, tell this woman how Terry had to give you a shot because you had VD. Let's talk about condoms now, shall we, Angela? Oh, so you got VD? Checkmate. - Who you been with? - Angela, let's discuss this in private. No. You know what? It seems like you guys have been talking in private enough. How long have you had it? A week. Was it Keisha? No. You didn't get it from her. You got it from Walter. What are you talking about? I ain't gay. No. I slept with him. I got a shot. I was just waiting for you to say something. Boom! Yeah. Mm-hmm. Don't! I hope he breaks your throat. Touchdown! Get off of me! - Man, come on, man. Come on! - Don't be putting your hands on me! Arrest him! Get him. You see he trying to kill me. - Let me go. - Arrest him, Troy! That's why I slept with her! You so damn evil! You know what? You put your hands on the wrong one, Marcus. - I'm out of here. - Get out of here. Now, that's the best idea I heard since we got up here. Let's cut this trip short. Baby, go pack our stuff. We outta here. Look, I'm sorry you had to hear this way. Thank your friend over there. It's over. I'll be more than fair, but I want a divorce. Hey, you can have the rental property. I'll have Paco put bars on there for you, so don't thank me or nothing. It's a rough neighborhood. You can have your car. And I'll figure everything else out. Huh? Whatever. Oh, my God. Oh, I hope he's dead. I'll get my medical bag. # Oh, oh # # Mmm... # # Oh # # Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh # # Yeah # # Givin' up # # It's hard to do # # When you really # # Love someone # # Givin' up... # Shelia, you know you had the key in the door. You came to arrest me? Actually, I saw your car out front. And I just came to check on you. Did I kill him? No. You didn't kill him, but, uh... Heh. He's gonna have one hell of a headache. I should have killed him. Shelia, you don't mean that. Maybe you do. I gave him my life. You know, he emptied out my bank account? I have $87 to my name. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Well, if you've got a minute, I'd like to show you something. Hey, guys, I'm really sorry about everything, OK? I love you. I'll call you later. Bye, baby. If anyone hears from Shelia, we'll let each other know, right? - Yes. - Bye, guys. All right, daddy. Give that man what he wants. Have a safe drive. Are we gonna talk about this? Gavin, please. Not right now. Oh, you're not gonna...? I'll do it. What? You wasn't even gonna tell me, were you? Why did you test our daughter? Because you are so damn busy that when you got pregnant, we had sex what... once? Well, what were the results? What do you mean? She's mine. Really? Huh. What the hell is that supposed to mean? What the hell you saying, Dianne? Yeah, OK. OK. It's snowing a little bit... but this is where I come to clear my head. I just come right here. I pray. I scream. I yell. Do whatever I need to do. And it's just me and God. You ever come here to cry? Yeah. That, too. I can't even... describe to you the pain I feel. It's like I've been hit by a car. I keep trying to understand. Why I'm... what did I do... so wrong? Why he betrayed me? It hurts. I have no life without him. I can't even pray about it. You know, Shelia, this is a great time for a new start if you want to stay. Oh. I thought you were still at work. I took the day off. I'm gonna get dinner started. We need to talk, Patricia. I don't think so. I know you heard what Michael said at the table. So you're not gonna deal with it? Look, Gavin, I have dealt with this, OK? This is what I do for a living. I'm a doctor. I've dealt with this. Yeah, well, you haven't talked to me about it. So now you want to talk to me the way you did Mike? Now you want to cry your eyes out to me? It's not like you made it easy for me to discuss this. Yeah, we talk about... Noah like has never here. Can you look at his picture? Patricia, please. Please put... Can you just look at his picture? Gavin, I didn't know... - I didn't know you blamed me for it. - I... OK. I blamed you. I blamed... I'm sorry. OK? I blame myself, too. I blamed God, but... It's no one's fault. Baby, just look at the picture. All right. Steak or chicken? Patricia, no! Look at the picture! No! You know what? Stop it! - Patricia, look at... - Stop it! - Patricia, Patricia... - Gavin, just stop it! Patricia, just look at the picture. Stop with your pretending. - I'm not... - Stop. Would you... you pretend that you love me. Stop with all those lies! - I can't take this. - Patricia. You know you hate me. I hate myself for this! - I don't hate you. Baby. - This is my fault! - No. Don't touch me! - Baby. - Don't touch me. - OK. Well... No. Will you just listen to me for once, please? - It's not your fault. - This is my fault. I walk around here trying to act like "perfect Patty. " You know, well, perfect Patty messed up. - OK? - No one's asking you... No. Will you just listen... Listen for a minute! - I'm not... - Listen! Perfect Patty messed up. I was in a hurry. And... I strapped him in. I strapped him in. But I didn't secure it. I didn't check. Check to see if it was secure. And... It was raining. And... I slid off the road, and now... And now? - Now he's dead. - I know. I know, baby. - I know. - He's not coming back. You know, Gavin, I can deal with a lot of things, but this... I'm not strong enough to deal with this, baby. Hey, you don't have to be... strong by yourself. Just let me be. Let me be strong for you, OK? We can make it through. Baby, I'll be there for you. No matter what. Please... I need to see Marcus. OK. Hold for one second. What the hell are you doing here? - I need to see Marcus. - No. You better get out of this building. I need to see Marcus. No. I said you better get out of this building. Oh, no, you didn't touch me! I'm gonna pack you out of here! You know who you messin' with, huh? - What are you doing here? - Look, I need to talk to you. About what? Do you mind? Yes, I mind. Marcus, you better get her the hell out of here before I throw her out on her face! Marcus, you better get that ho! You better check that ho! - You know what? - Angie, Angie, Angie. Let me take care of this. Yeah. 'Cause I know how to handle it! He got a handle. He can handle all of this. - Get her. Deal with her. - All this! He handles it. And well! Well, Miss Press n' Curl. Ya ho! Y'all know I don't take that. I kick ass up in here every Tuesday. Y'all know who you work for! You know who you work for! What is it? Yeah. You know what? She's right here in this office. Angela, talk to her. I think that's what you should do. I'm not gonna talk to her. If she says one thing to me, I'm going to jail for murder. Well, I'm a lawyer. I'll get you off. - Shelia's on line two. - Oh! Guys, Shelia's on line two. I'm gonna conference us in, OK? But you know what? If you got to be that damn tenderheaded, why don't you get out of my damn chair? Get out of my chair looking like next ghetto top weave. - Oh... - Shelia? Are you OK? We've been trying to reach you. Yeah. I'm... Mike turned my cell phone off. Shelia, honey, do you need some money? Angela, I'm fine. I got a job in a general store. A general store? Don't ask. I'll be all right. Do you need a place to stay? You can live with us. No, Patricia. I spent too much time letting other people take care of me. I've gotta find my own way. Where are you? Just know I'm fine, Dianne. I gotta do this on my own. I'm really proud of you, Shelia. I'm gonna call you guys soon. I love you. We're really sorry this happened. - Shelia, I'm so sorry. - I'll be all right. Honey, I love you, OK? - We love you. - We love you. I love y'all, too. Um, Dianne, tell Terry I said happy birthday, OK? Oh, my God! Is that today? Dianne, you didn't forget, did you? - Oh. I have to go. - OK. I'll talk to you. Later. Hey, Sheriff. Hey. Hey! Thanks for getting me this job. Ha! You kidding me? If it wasn't for you, this place wouldn't even be open again. My daddy loved this store. It's his lifelong dream, this place. # Ooh, I want you # # The right way # # And I want you # # I want you # # But I want you to want me, too # # Want me, too # # Want you to want me # # I want you to love me baby # # Just like I want you... # Oh. You work out every day? Not every day. I should go with you sometime. You know you laugh, but you might actually enjoy it. Keeps the stress down. I couldn't run from here to that door. Maybe we can... maybe we can start walking first. If you want to. No. You know, Shelia, you've been putting in a lot of time in this place, you know, getting it to be open and all. Want to go to the movies later? # I want you # # But I want you to want me, too # # I want you # # To want me, baby # # Just like I want you # Shelia? What did you say? Movies. Have some fun. Laugh, smile. You want to go? OK. - # Oh, sugar # - OK. # To share is precious # # Pure and fair # # Ooh # Why the hell was she at my salon? She had to see me. About what? Angela, lay off. I'm getting sick of this. Oh, then leave. You keep it up, and that's just what I'm gonna do. Oh, please, Marcus. Please. You ain't going nowhere. You know why you ain't going nowhere? 'Cause... this is my money! You need this money! - I'm sick of you. - Get out! - Get out! - What are you talking about? - No, stop! Get... - First of all... First of all! It was my money that started the damn business. Now, you think I'm with you for the money? I'm with you because I love you, but you too damn stupid to see it. I was with you when you didn't have a dime. And I've always been there for you! Not afraid to let you shine. It's a damn shame when you women are so used to losing you don't realize when you've won. Kids, get your stuff. Your daddy here. I know you did not bring this trick up into my house. I have told you...! Just shut up! Shut! Now, Keisha... this is my wife. And you are going to respect her. So don't call our house or come by my job unless it's got something to do with the kids. We're done. Now, I have to have a relationship with you because of them, and that is it. So if it ain't got nothing to do with the kids, don't you call me! And I'm gonna tell you this one time. You better stop talking to my kids about her, do you understand me? Yeah. Wow. It's about time... Hey! Shut! Now, both of y'all, better learn to get along for the sake of these kids. And stop acting like you're both damn 5 years old! Daddy. - Hi, babies. - Hi, guys. - Hey. - Hi, honey. Get in the car. Hop on in. OK. All right now. Better put your seatbelts on. OK. Now, daddy's gonna see you guys a little later, OK? Put your seatbelt on. Daddy loves you. Baby. Marcus, where are you going? Oh! I am so sorry I'm late. I just, you know, I got wrapped up, and it just slipped my mind. It's all right, love. You remember what you want to remember. Babe, I really am sorry. OK. I will see you at the office tomorrow, doc, OK? OK, Pam. Listen, thanks for the cake and ice cream. Anytime, Terry. All right, darling. - Happy birthday. - Oh, thank you, Pam. Ha ha! Are you two having an affair? I think I better go. Yeah. You better. And don't come back to this house. I'll see you at the office, Pam. - OK. - Thanks for being so nice. Good night. You fire her, and I mean it! You don't come in this house and give me any damn ultimatums. What is going on? You answer me keep your voice down. Our daughter is in this room sleeping. Don't you let that whore back in this house again. Now, look, I'm warning you. That whore has tutored your daughter, went to her recital, picked her up when you left her sitting on the school steps twice. OK, and what has she done for my husband, I wonder. I have to work, Terry! This is not about your damn job! It's not? Then where is this coming from all of a sudden? What the hell are you talking about "all of a sudden"? This is not all of a sudden! It's been... I don't even know how long it's been that I've been begging you, I've been... I have been begging you to spend some time with me, begging you for months. And I have! What kind of man has to make an appointment to sleep with his wife? Obviously, one who has too much time on his hands. Oh! What do you want me to do? What do I want you to do? What I want you to do. How about the obvious? How about baking a cake for my birthday or spending some time with me or your daughter, OK? How about doing what a wife does, screwing me on a regular? Can you handle that? You know what? I am all for solutions, but maybe we could come up with something that doesn't involve me stepping back into the fifties! You are so selfish. I am not selfish. Oh, what the hell are you talking about, you're not selfish? Dianne, you laid there and had your tubes tied, and you didn't even tell me? You don't think that's selfish? Look, this is my body, OK? You don't have to carry a child, I do! You don't have to miss work, I do! Dianne, when you get married, you give up the "Is" for us, OK? You don't make those kind of decisions without talking to me! What the hell am I doing? I don't even know why I'm having this argument with you. I'm tired of arguing about the same damn thing with you. It's clear to me... one thing, very clear. You don't want to be married. Can I tell you what this is about? My entire career is going way better than yours. And you're having some testosterone issues. And you can't deal with it. Have you lost your mind? No. But I'm about to lose my wife. I'm moving out. I'll be right back. I really love your dad's place. But I got to pay you back. I do! Naw. It's all good. Don't even sweat that. Mm. Are my legs supposed to be this sore? No pain, no gain, right? Huh. Um... I need to tell you something. Yeah, sure. What's up? I'm really vulnerable right now... and, um... we can't go to the movies and hang out and stuff. - What? What do you mean? - I mean... I just got to the point where I can say Mike's name without crying, and I don't want to get caught up in what Patricia and Dr. Phil call "The Hero Syndrome. " It's when somebody comes along and they help you out, and just 'cause they were being nice, you fall for 'em, and... you're just being nice. I don't know, Shelia. I could have this same hero thing going on with you, too. What are you talking about? I'm serious. I mean... look at you. This man was trying to break you, and every day I see you take some of that power back. I didn't so anything. I just signed the papers. I didn't even fight. Sometimes signing the papers is all the fighting you need to do. Don't play with me. I'm not playing with you. I mean, Shelia, you are amazing, intelligent, spiritual, sexy. Strong... strong and beautiful woman. Not as big as I am. You know, if you're not happy about the way you look, then change it. Stop doubting yourself. I mean, it's not attractive. I don't like it. And hell, it makes me uncomfortable for you. I'm sorry. I'm just so used to... Mike saying things, I... try to beat him to it. I ain't Mike. Oh. Mm. Mm. Oh, Jesus. Lord, have mercy. God. I ain't thought that in a long time. Um... OK. I think I need to pray. Um... can we pray? All right. Well, I hope she can help her now. Well, if she can... what are you two doing here? Did something happen? - No. - Did something happen to Shelia? - No, no, no. Don't worry. - No, honey. - Calm down. We're OK. - Oh. I thought somebody had died or something. What are you doing here? - Girl, we got men problems. - Man problems. Thank God it's just men. OK. That I can deal with. What happened? OK. You ready for this? Terry moved out. He got his own apartment. He's so upset with me. And I have never seen Marcus so mad at me. He went off. He set me straight. And Keisha, but she deserved it. And Angie, you didn't? You know, if I didn't know these men, I would just think that they were crazy. - They are. - Yeah. Come on, you guys. Will you call them and talk to them? Uh-uh. No. I am not about to do that. No. I'm not gonna be all vulnerable. You know, you guys are just pathetic. If you're not gonna be honest with your husbands, then who are you gonna be vulnerable with? - You! - You! Thank you very much, but... this is the reason why they're so upset at you. Because you haven't been truthful with them. Tell them how you want them to hold you at night and how you're afraid for them to leave you. Y'all know this. Is she kidding me? I am not about to do that, period. See, Angie, your problem is you're afraid that he won't do what it is that you want him to do. - You just stubborn. - So? I'll tell you what. I'm not ready to face possible rejection. - I'm just not. - Me, either. Rejection? Look at you guys sitting here looking like little lost puppies. Tell them what you tell me all the time. Tell them the truth. Tell them what you're feeling. Ew... she makes me sick. She's always got something smart to say. Listen, I want you guys to do this little lesson here. - Uh-oh. - Here we go. Oh, come on. You guys stop it. Some big exercise. It's gonna work. Gavin and I just did this. So it's really gonna help. Take this paper. On one side of it, I want you to list all the bad he's ever done. OK, and on the other side, I want you to list all the good he's ever done. Now, if the bad outweighs the good, then so be it. Don't hold on. Just let it go. But... but if this good outweighs the bad, then y'all need to be big little women and fix this. This is not healthy. I don't want to be a big little woman, Pat. I want to be a little girl. You are not in college anymore, Angie. - Just grow up. - Yeah. Thank you. Well, I got to get to class, guys. So... I'll see you at the ceremony, yes? Oh, no, no. We can't make it. Sorry. - She's joking. - I'm playing. - Of course! - We'll be there. I want you married with your husbands, all right? Well, I might be there with my new boyfriend - if this list don't look right. - Angie. If you do the work, it'll be fine. - All right. - Bye. - Bye, baby. - Thank you. I tell you, I need a legal pad to write this list, honey. You know what I would do if I was single right now, you know what I'd be doing? Sitting here having a drink with y'all. Thanks for giving me a call. They are wasted, man. - We need another round! - Where's your help, huh? Night off. Man, I told him, quit. What's up, fellas? - Hey! - Hey! How you doing, man? I got the hen, man. Oh, thanks. We were sitting here thinking of a way to kill our wives and wondering if you could help us. Hey, that always works. Mm-hmm. - Oh, man. - Tell me something, man. Why is it that when a woman say she want a good man and then she get one, she do everything she can to drive him crazy. I got the answer. 'Cause women don't know what they want, especially yours. Am I right, Gavin? I'm gonna divorce Dianne. I'm gonna call her up and tell her, "You know what? We're getting a divorce. " Yeah, right. You and Dianne are made for each other. No. No. I ain't gonna call her. I'm gonna send her a text. You want to piss a woman off, send her a text like something. Oh, stop it. Stop it, man. You got a good woman. You need to work it out. Good woman or not, she got to be willing to work it out. I had a good woman once. Hmm. Anybody seen Shelia? Boy, Angela talks to her from time to time - but... - Really? Sound to me like you miss her. - I'm... - What? No! No! I don't miss her. You made a mistake. It's OK to say so. I didn't make a mistake, all right? Who are you talking to? Heh. I should of just, you know... I should of just... done a background check on Trina. Ha! Girl don't do nothing. She don't cook, don't clean, don't... wash clothes. Don't do... take the garbage out. She don't do... she just don't. Oh, she can shop. 'Cause she burning up my American Express. All right! Whoo! Quality. Quality. Hey, Gavin. You know what that sound like to me? 80l20. I tried to... yeah, right. You think about that with Dianne. Man, I'm going back to her. I'm just right now... I'm teaching her a lesson. Yeah. What lesson is that? You know what the lesson is? I ain't gotta be there. That's the real lesson. I don't... I don't... I don't have to be there. I can go. Boo-yah! Yeah, that's great. Yeah. That's gonna look good. 36 years old. Out there dating again. Mm. That ain't the good look. Especially the way you're missing your ex. Hey, Mike. You got what you wanted, didn't you? What's all this for? I just thought I would cook for you. Come on, baby. Sit. Oh, just let me wash my hands. OK. Hello? Hello? Marcus? Man, she has cooked. She ain't said two words to me since we got back. I've been sleeping with one eye open and she cooked. Well, if she ain't cooking grits, you ain't got nothing to worry about. No, man. She's trying to kill me. Look, I'm calling you 'cause I want you to know if something happens to me, I want y'all to know she did it. Just go eat your dinner, all right? Angela's not that crazy. This is Angela. You know what? You're right. She is kinda crazy. Look, if anything tastes funny, spit it out. OK, OK. I love you, man. I love you, too. # Swift as a wind song # # You sang the music of anhonest bird # # I waited for some contradiction # # Truth was ringing in your every word # # And every moment since then # # The one thing I can tell # # Is that I belong with you # # And no one else # You haven't touched your food. It's good, but... I'm just not that hungry. You know what I'm saying? You're still lying. I'm just saying, look... you ain't said two words to me, and all of a sudden I come home and you cooked. Marcus, look, I know that I haven't been the easiest woman to get along with. And I know it's been hard for you. But none of that matters. Life is too short. You're trying to kill me, ain't you? Just cut to it. Patricia gave you one of them mind games to play on me. Now, if it's about Keisha, we can talk about Keisha. Marcus, it's not about her. It's about us, right? Honey, I love you. I just want us to start over again. Just me and you. If that's OK. You're serious? Yes. So... if that is the case, you gonna stop talking to me like you crazy. Done. We're gonna stay committed to each other. And know that I am doing my best. I know you are, Marcus. And I'm so sorry for making you feel like you weren't. One more. You're gonna have to stop drinking. OK! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh, one second. OK? I love you, baby. I love you, too. Finished. - I bought that in Africa. - Did you really? - Yeah. Me and Dianne. - Wow. Oh. It's gorgeous. Come in! It was last year. Really? Dianne, what are you doing...? Let me just say this, please. I am wrong. I am so wrong for not telling you, and... I've just taken you for granted. And I'll do anything. I'll do whatever it takes, whatever it takes so that you can just come home. Because... I made that list, and I realize that I need you and I love you. What list? What are you talking about? I'm gonna go. No, no, no. What are you saying? Are you saying we can work it out? Yes. Let me ask you something. When we were in Colorado, we were in the car, and I said, "I tested Kenya because, so and so. " And then you said, "Huh," like she wasn't mine. - Were you having an affair or something? - No! Terry, I was just mad. I just said that to get back at you. To get back at me? OK. And we can work this out through anything? Yes. OK. I guess that means I'll tell you this then. She's pregnant. With twins. Oh, OK, OK. OK, you know what? We'll work it out. We'll work it out. You mean it? Yeah. OK. Well, just like you said just to get back at me I just did that to get back at you. - She's not. - Oh, Terry! - Dr. Brock. - We have never, ever, ever had an affair. There's nothing going on. And my boyfriend would be very upset to hear you say that. Yes. He's a big linebacker. Thank God you got a boyfriend. - Yes, I do. - All right. Well, then can you just come home? Please take him. Take him home. I'm very sorry. - I will lock up. - All right. Lock up. Hey. - How you doing, Marcus? - Mike, Mike, look at you. Hey, boy, you looking real sweet. Oh, nice suit. I know your bald-headed ass did not bring her up in here. - Baby. - Yes, I did. All right. Come on. Come on, now. Hey. - Hi. - You look gorgeous. Thank you. So do you. And where have you been? 'Cause Pat's having a meltdown about hair. - Oh, are you serious? - Yes. Come on. I'm gonna show you where she is. OK. I'll see you guys. You look good. Bye, baby. Mwah! Why is your wife so evil? You stop it. All right? I'm playing. So, how you guys been doing? - We're good. How have you been? - Good. - Great. - Good. Good. - You look good. - Thank you. Well, I'm gonna go to the ladies room and freshen up. - All right. - Ooh! Lipstick. Lipstick. Don't kiss me. Stop, stop, stop. Shelia? Heh. - Trina. - Wow. You look amazing. How... how are you? I feel amazing. Wow. I wondered what I would do when I saw you again. If I would cuss you out or stomp you on the street, whup that ass. And amazingly... all I want to do is pray for you. But don't tempt me. Stay away from the wine bottles, OK? Have a good evening. Sheriff? Oh, what you doing here? Well, we came to support Patricia on her big night. "We?" Who's we? Me and my wife. OK. I think I'm ready. Shelia? Hello, Mike. Which way is it? Right up here to the left, honey. - You look beautiful. - Thank you. Perfect! Thank you. So much. That's beautiful. Divas... Oh, my God! Oh, you remembered. - How could I forget? - What happened? Where? Oh... Oh, my God! We've been worried about you, you know. I'm fine. That's this glow that I see happening here? I haven't seen that in a long time. I'd like to think I had a little something to do with that. Oh, hey, Troy. How you doing, ladies? What are you doing here? Shelia? I stayed in Colorado. We're married now. Get out! You're about to make me have a heart attack. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Troy, you gotta go. Get out. Troy, get out. We need to speak to our friend, so she can tell us what happened. - All right, all right. I'm leaving. - Bye. Oh, Shelia! Shelia and Troy together? Yes. They're together. They're together and they look, you know, she look really good. She looks what? Did you hear? I missed it, too. I said she looked good. OK, she looked really good. Mike. - All right. She look really good. - OK. Good. So, I, you know... it was just... I haven't seen her in awhile. So it was kind of, you know, ooh. What the hell are you saying, man? I'm just saying it was kind of surprising. It was kind of surprising to see her. To see her what? Yeah. I just haven't seen her in awhile, that's all. - You miss her? - What? Come on, man. What, y'all drinking too much. Troy. How you doing, guys? Hey, Sheriff. What's going on? Good to see you, brother. Same here. Well, congratulate him. You know, him and Shelia got married. Right. Hey, congrat... Can you believe he married my ex? To you and Shelia. - To you and Shelia. - Yes. Thank you. He what now? Said he married my ex. One man's ex can be another man's treasure. So, um, she had that gastric bypass? No. Actually, we just... we just worked out together. Ooh. You know what that means, right? L... I just can't wait to see her. I want to see her, too, man. I can't wait to see what working out will do for you. I'm going to the table, man. I can't play with y'all. Hey, man. Don't be bitter, man. We're just... we're just clowning around. Working out, man. Working out. I thought... I prayed... that God would save my marriage. But it wasn't built on the right things anyway. I thought if Mike got right, you know... if I lost the weight, that everything would be OK. It's been hard. It's been hard. But it's me. I did it. I'm doing it. That's right. And it feels so good. It feels so good. Oh! I thought that God had given up on me. Yeah. Because... here I am in this marriage and it don't work. He don't love me, he don't like me. But he brought me somebody. He is an amazing man. He is supportive. He doesn't criticize me. He walks with me. He loves me through all of it. You understand what I'm saying? Oh, Jesus. I didn't have that. And I do now. And... I wake up. I wake up with so much joy in my heart. Oh! Oh, God. Help us, Jesus. He already has, huh? I wake up with so much joy in my heart. Ah. You are so beautiful, Shelia. Oh, my God. But you are not... - with that makeup. - Aah! We need to get it together. - This is. - No, we can't do that. Oh, my God. OK, we got to get it together. I need some tissue. Oh, Jesus! OK, give me some. I need some powder. First of all, I'd like to thank everyone for such a lovely, lovely evening. I feel very proud to be the first black woman to receive this award. I'm very blessed to have won an honor for a book that has given me such gratification and information... and great vacations. Hey, we really didn't get a chance to talk. On purpose? Come on, Shelia. Don't be like that. What do you want, Mike? I'm trying to listen to Patricia. Look, I'm sorry about how all this went down. Dianne, Terry... OK? I don't... I don't want you to be mad at me. Marcus... forgiveness, you know? I want you to forgive me. Isn't that what the good book says? Yes. I forgave you a long time ago. Because if I had stayed angry, I would have taken it out on Troy. And he is too good for that. You understand? Yeah. - Yeah. He's too good for that. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. Hey, I was your first. You never forget your first, right? You did think you were my first, didn't you? I just wanted to say sorry and, uh... you know, there's this, um, there's this thing called the 20l80 rule. Mike... I know all about the 80l20 rule. Look... I thank you for helping me find myself then. But the woman I am now is done with you. So turn around and go back to Trina. Your 20. I say clear and loud... for everyone to hear... Gavin... I love you. I love you. And in closing, I would like for everyone to remember the greatest achievement for any human being is to love God... yourself... and others. Thank you so much for this.
