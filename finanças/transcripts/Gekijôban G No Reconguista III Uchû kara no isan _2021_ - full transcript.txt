Reconquista in G III "Legacy from Space” This map was created using data from before Minovsky particles were dispersed. This is our Amerian Army. The fleet led by the Rattle-Python is approaching the top of Sankt Porto. - This data... so huge! - Rattle-Python? The Amerian Army is quite impressive. Creating something like this! It's all thanks to our princess's father. I heard they used something called the Rose of Hermes Blueprints. Stop praising them. Apologies, miss. I can't believe President Nicchini goaded him into commanding the fleet himself. Since we're negotiating the terms of the occupation in Sankt Porto, the presence of General Gusion is necessary. My father is no politician. Ms. Gisela, how do I convert the images? Use universal standards. Thanks! XO, I'll use these two displays. Roger that. Where did you get this data? From Colonel Cumpa Rusita's Research Division, of course. Here we go! Diagram of Sankt Porto. Sankt Porto? This makes the army's data look like a joke. So this right here is the pier. And a size comparison with the Kashiba Mikoshi. This is the Nut atop the Capital Tower. Where photon batteries are delivered. I've never seen such a massive and detailed diagram of it! Well, it's a taboo. How come you've never seen it, Capital Guards? The SU-Cordists have jurisdiction over it. We can't go up there. Those who violate the taboo are not allowed to return. Is that true? Apparently. I want to put an end to such politics of terror. If the Amerian Fleet can enter Sankt Porto, then so can the Megafauna. In theory, yes. Impossible. There's no way a lone unregistered ship can get in without a fleet. It may be possible to enter through the 144th Nut. It's right below Sankt Porto, right? That nut is called Demeter, isn't it? How do you know? - Raraiya Monday's running wild again!? - Again...?! - Jeez! - Why don't you get it? You can say that, but-- What's with her? She won't calm down! Raraiya, hold your horses! You stop that! I don't like it! - G, he hates it! - Calm down! Raraiya, stop! Bell! -Idon't like it! - Well, too bad! - Don't move. - Whats wrong with her? She says the G-Self isn't free! Well, then. Okay! - Don't be selfish! - Adrenalin, rising! I see what she wants. Raraiya feels that way because she knows the G-Self. I've started to understand what she's saying, but you'd better read the manual for this Assault Pack on time. Assault Pack? Surely, a Capital Guard like yourself must be thinking about Sankt Porto right now? Ill read it. Return fo the Salamandra, keeping the Hecate on your right. They've gotten pretty used to this. It gives me high hopes for them. Oof. But at Sankt Porto, we're actually in space. The Captain found this. The Capital Tower's Charter of the Universe? That part. "Aid must be rendered to a disabled vehicle." They don't define what a vehicle is, so if we make it look like we're in distress... Sankt Porto ought to let us in. Captain, you jerk! Air leak!? We'll die in space! Help us! Will that actually fool them? Our target is quite naive. Over! - Just a little! - Stop! Now, listen here. We know that His Holiness and Director Wilmit have gone up to Sankt Porto. Even if that's the case, we at the 144th Nut, Demeter, have only confirmed your and Bellri Zenam's IDs, Lieutenant Kerbes. The Megafauna, as a ship in distress, will not be allowed to leave this port. Director Wilmit in Sankt Porto will-- About that! Hurry it up, will you? I thought I could sweet talk them. They don't know anything about war. What's with that? That's just how the Capital Guard is. You want me to slap you again? They could be forgeries. I doubt it! I'll try going up in the Arcane. Then I'll go as well. What can you do by yourself? Hey, watch how you speak to the princess! Captain, I'm worried about what Captain Klim is up to in Sankt Porto. Surely, we can leave here if it's only two mobile suits. Eject the rubble from the side hatch! Sankt Porto, ready to receive us. So that code worked... didn't it? Yes, "Towasanga," and so forth. If inspectors from the Church come aboard, we'll use them as hostages. Chuchumy, look, it's so pretty. Demeter. The Crown is coming. Sankt Porto is close now. That's Sankt Porto? We are overcrowded. Those are Amerian Army mobile suits. There's a whole lot of them. My father's fleet is already here, underneath Sankt Porto. This is a space fleet! Y-yeah! How pretty! This massive ship can travel up to Sankt Porto? Just what are these Rose of Hermes Blueprints? H-hey, hold still. They'll let us pass. The inner cylinder is rotating! This is a space colony. So that's the Crown's terminal station. If it isn't the G-Arcane! Miss Aida has come fo join us' Miss Aida's Arcane is towing the G-Self. What? Yes. The G-Self is tied up. We just arrived as well, but Captain Klim immediately headed-- Don't run! Captain Klim headed to the cathedral with General Gusion to pay their respects to the pope. The cathedral, you say? Get out here and take the elevator up to the port entrance building. - It's just outside. - Ah, thanks. Your mother will be with the pope, right? - Elevator. - They're probably together. Going up. One card per person. This is a space colony? This place is taboo, you know! - Woah! - What is this? What's taboo about this? You're going to the cathedral, right? It'll take 5 minutes on a Shank. How much? We only have day rentals. Don't run scams in a place like this! They put a hill on top of the port entrance. So it seems. Miss Aida! Amerian soldiers! They're deployed this far in. Your father awaits inside. The fact that we've brought our fleet here to Sankt Porto, shows that Ameria has the ability to manage this place, does it not? What do you think? I suggest you adapt to the situation. We can't have that. It's not even the Holy Spirit Festival now. So it's exceptional that His Holiness is present up here-- Father, didn't you come here to eliminate the threat from space? - Aida! - Bell! These two... We can't deal with the threat unless we first take control... - ...0f the photon battery system. - Klim, you idiot! The management of the Capital Tower is a duty entrusted to us by SU-Cordism. Mom! Young one, the power of the holy land of Towasanga-- The people of Towasanga come from Universal Century survivors who made up the Hermes Foundation and-- Emergency! Playing back the emergency live from 6 seconds ago, and continuing. Playing back live from 5 seconds ago, and continuing. Direction SS. 117 degrees. The Gavial was shot down! So the threat from space was real! No, that's not it. If it really was, they'd have attacked here first. How come you exploded a ship right next to Sankt Porto?! I only ordered you to intimidate them! We're about to bring the Kashiba Mikoshi here, yet this happens? It'll take another hundred years to train true soldiers, I suppose. Isn't it a bit early for us to move the Salamandra? I want them to send out a mobile suit force. Raraiya! Raraiya! Oh, jeez! There? She even remembers the location of her locker! Oh, thanks. Miss Raraiya. Are you aware of the warning from Towasanga-- Isn't it a little too soon to talk about that? Oh, she does seem frightened. - Earlier... - Yes? What were you speaking with Inspector General Gusion-- What were you talking about? Come again? Your father said he was going back to the Rattle-Python. The Capital Army will be coming up in the Crown. Raraiya? You need a helmet! It's Chuchumy's! - Raraiya! - Your helmet! Hold your horses! Hey, you look to be in high spirits. Hey, it's Mr. Kerbes! What are you doing here? I came up here to help you people, obviously! Lieutenant Luan brought a G-Self backpack. He's waiting outside. Huh? Thank you! - Report now. Report now. - Time to head out! Enemy identified as Doretfe Fleet. That's dangerous! Make her stop! Stop it! - Stop! - What's going on? She says she doesn't like the tape that's tying up the G-Self. Bellri, hurry up and get those two aboard! Oh, right. Captain Klim is saying the enemy fleet might withdraw if we take their leader. Sounds like something that Captain Genius would come up with. Good girl. Can we stop the Amerian Army from doing that? We might have to protect the bigwigs, though... Head outside and install that backpack! - Roger. - Did they deploy the Garanden as well? The director is using the Capital Tower's standard comms line. Where was the Garanden hiding? It seems they hid it in the 143rd Nut. Inspector General Gusion! Careless actions will only serve to provoke the fleet from the Moon. I'm aware of that, but they started this. It's from the Megafauna. It's me, Captain Donyell. Are they proposing a joint front of all Earth people against the mystery fleet? A joint front? Emergency live now! Emergency live now! Dorette Fleet is approaching. What the heck! I repeat, Doretfe Fleet is approaching. I repeat, Doretfe Fleet is approaching. Raraiya? Dorette... Dorette... Raraiya? What's wrong? All men, stand by outside. Your Holiness! - This way. - I shall accompany you. I'll go to Luan. Huh? Isn't that Captain Klim's battleship named Salamandra? Looks like they're getting ready to engage! Mr. Luan says to land down there! Thank you! - Turn your back to me. - Sure. There's three of you stuffed in there? - You were watching us, weren't you? - Now, listen... You might be part of the joint front. Send Raraiya and Noredo over to me! - What do you mean by joint? - Raraiya, what's wrong? All right, I'll swap out your battery too. Because General Noutu Dorette is coming here... N-N-Nout... D-D-D-Do... Raraiya! You're good fo go! Lieutenant Kerbes, Bellri, I'm done. Thankee. Then that's the Garanden? Right. It seems they made contact with Klim and the others aboard the Salamandra. They propose to fight together with us against this common enemy. All right! Mr. Kerbes! The Garanden is our enemy, you know! Recksnows belong to the Capital Guard. There's no way the Capital Army could shoot them. Here I go! Four machines are approaching from ahead! Four of them! This is part of Colonel Cumpa's orders. Let them aboard. They call it a mystery fleet, but from what continent? They're from the far side of the Moon. Ridiculous! What a joke! A Gondwanese person like yourself may have trouble believing it, but it's because of people like them that the Garanden could be built. Here I am. Your friendly welcoming party. The remaining two of you, show me your faces. Wuxias, take up alert positions. Switch places with the suits we've let in. The Barara team will be guarding the rear. This is a chance to make our enemies fight each other. You have to try your luck while you can. You've grown tough. Air infused! Mechanic check. Wait! Raraiya! Hey, that's right! - Chuchumy! - Noredo! Y-Yes? It's Manny! Manny Ambassada! What are you doing here, Manny? I heard Luin left for the front and came here to search for him! Manny? It's Manny! It's me! Did you find Luin? No. That mobile suit must be...! Oh, it's Captain Mask! I know who you are. You're the space pirate woman who got captured at the Biclover. And you're the one who attacked me. That's what you get for calling yourself a pirate. Let's not do this. Were you cajoled into this by our Amerian genius, Captain? Klim Nick, huh? Do I look like such a rash man? It seems a mobile suit force has launched from the Salamandra. That was surprisingly quick. I'm Barara Peor. It's such a pleasure to meet you. That's an appalling violation of the taboo! R-Right! We'll prepare the mobile suits to launch. S-See you later! - Take care! - You too Bellri! - Will do. - Raraiya? Nobell and Chuchumy. Mack Knife, taking off! Okay! I'll permit the group that's joined us to launch as well! Lieutenant, look after Noredo and Raraiya. Sure! - Protect the Megafauna, too. - I know! Hurry up, or Mask won't take you seriously! Light signals? That there must be Captain Klim Nick of the Amerian Army. Yes, we call it the Blue Jahannam. Jahannam, huh? This is Captain Mask of the Capital Army. I'm pleased that you accepted our proposal. Were fellow Earth people. I figured we'd have a chance of winning. It seems the enemy fleet has sent out a negotiating team, but if we crush the big guy in the middle of the fleet, their soldiers, unaccustomed to war, will be in confusion. Well, that's a splendid idea! Soldiers unaccustomed to war, huh? They sent out a boat fo negotiate, didn't they? Bellri, my boy, is that you? We need only pretend we never noticed it. Furthermore, we ourselves will serve as envoys. A white flag, huh? I see! We pretend to surrender, then when we get close, we crush their leader! What a genius! You got it! I'm not sure I can pull it off by myself so I have Mick to accompany me. I'm the Hecate's pilot, Mick Jack. Barara, you know what the Captain is thinking now? IT understand quite well! I'm Barara Peor! Can we really fool them with that toy? An Earth mobile suit force is on the move. Say what?! A white flag?! That means they've surrendered! Colonel Turbo! An envoy of surrender is heading for our fleet! Shall I call them back? We haven't yet been informed of any envoy. Drive them off. Shoot down any who act unofficially. Yes, sir. We shall. If they haven't dispersed Minovsky particles, we can obliterate them in one fell swoop with homing missiles. Wow! That's a space fleet? What should we do? They saw through us! Retreat! Bellri? What are you doing?! They ve seen through the plan! - What? - We have to retreat! The white flag has been torn up! Follow the G-Self and the blue one! Were retreating? Wh-What? It's because Sankt Porto is right behind us. They could never fire on us like this. The battle has ended. The negotiators have entered Sankt Porto. We must protect the negotiators. His Excellency, General Noutu Dorette has now arrived. I did not expect you to come meet us in person, Your Holiness. SU-Cord. We'll hurry. - Noredo. - Come on, run! Pardon me. Going up. It just turned out this way. Long time no see. Cadet Bellri Zenam? Miss Aida. - You seem well, Princess. - Thank you. Second Lieutenant Aida Surugan, I would ask you to refer to me by my nickname, Captain Mask. Captain? - This is... - Lieutenant Barara Peor. What are your intentions, Captain? If I see the enemy commander's face, it will help me formulate our next plan. - Right? -T guess... Right? One card per person. You can get to the cathedral in 5 minutes on a Shank. I don't really get it. Oh, that's the port entrance building. After you go up, you go down. The scale here is impressive. - Is that it? - It must be. What's wrong? Huh? You have a fever? Take care of her. There's got to be a doctor here at least. Ask at that mansion. Huh? A doctor, eh? We have come as guards for Inspector General Gusion Surugan. Likewise, I must enter to guard Director Wilmit Zenam. Some guards you are, arriving this late! We're doing it to match your numbers. We're going in. You Earth people have been treating Universal Century technology as though it were a child's toy. It was taboo! And yet your side has been constructing a fleet to invade Earth. Over the past ten years, you Earth people have gone as far as fighting intercontinental wars. Therefore, it became apparent to General Noutu Dorette that we would require military forces of our own. I have it all figured out! Ameria's bitter enemy Gondwan has goaded you into invading Earth. And then, you will carry out an emigration to Earth -- a Reconquista! That is your true intent! You filth! Hey, you can't do that! It's because Towasanga has kept supplying Earth with photon batteries... Towasanga? that you were able to build a flimsy history on earth! You call our history flimsy? Well... The reconstruction of Earth requires the enthusiastic support of Towasanga. Inspector General Gusion, I would ask you to communicate this to the president and people of Ameria. Certainly. One more thing. That Ameria managed to construct a space fleet, means that you must have had collaborators from Towasanga. Not just survivors of the Rayhunton family. I wish to discuss these matters as well. Is that well? Of course. Princess! Is it from Colonel Cumpa? Well, yeah. Hey! Hey! Raraiya said she likes that house! It's right beside the doctor's place! She likes the one right there! So she didn't have a fever! No fever? They said it's like growing pains. Our new home! I'll go check it out. - Lieutenant Luan. - Yes. Will you be able to return to the Megafauna alone? Of course. Tell Captain Donyell to prepare the ship to go to Towasanga. Seriously?! How are we to understand anything just by listening to those people? We'll just have to go see this Towasanga place for ourselves! Miss Aida! It's strange that the Megafauna is able to reach the Moon. We're going underneath Sankt Porto. Okay! Steer, we must stay close to the Capital Tower's cable, or they'll start shooting at us! That's what I'm doing! What? I didn't mean to do that. The Salamandra is on the move! Why, now? Because the Capital Army's Garanden iS moving too. What does the Rattle-Python think about that? It says don't go to the Moon. That's an order we can't follow. We'll overtake them! The Army's reinforcements are aboard those Crowns! Sankt Porto, entering first combat range! They might send out the G-Self and Arcane! Tell the Rattle-Python we're going to Sankt Porto! Understood, will do. Megafauna, ao not approach Sankt Porto. Mobile suits are on the move! This is why the princess called for us. There are three enemy movements! Minovsky particles are spread! Don't be frightened. R-Roger. What are those light signals saying? They say "Rockpie has headed for the Garanden." There we go. Even if you come to try the same thing again, I won't let you! Right now, Sankt Porto is to our rear. We can attack! We've engaged them in a mobile suit battle, so that the enemy won't notice what the Garanden is doing! What? They've suddenly retreated. What?! Stop them! Elmoran team! Hold your fire! That guy...! Come at me! Sankt Porto is no longer behind me. Catch on to what I've done. Garanden, we're withdrawing from this sector! Mobile suits, defend the ship! Theyre going to pursue us! This ship will head for the Moon using Sankt Porto as a shield. Go to the Moon? Is Captain Mask serious about this? The Salamandra will pull back from Sankt Porto. Even if the Dorette Fleet pursues... Hey, the Megafauna really is going to be moving as well, right? Yes, sir. We've confirmed it on the long-range monitor. Well, now. The G-Self and the Arcane joined up with them? If the enemy are going to be scattering their forces... We're going to the Moon! The Salamandra is leaving! Hurry it up, please! Steer, fake us out! - The Salamandra has left foo! - See? I'm working on it! The connectors on this backpack aren't good. Steer, break away at maximum combat speed! - Roger! - We've ended up at the rear! We're going all the way to the Moon. You can't afford to receive SO much as a scratch here. Don't forget it's your own concern, too. Lieutenant Happa-- installed a backpack for space. And we wont waste that Just leave it to me! ...isn't something I'll say, but .. Say it! At times like this, even if it's a lie, it reassures people. We're fine while we have Sankt Porto acting as a shield, but soon enough, the Dorette Fleet will bombard us with their guns. That they've opened fire means they'll be sending out mobile suits as well. But... only three suits? What idiots! They have confidence in their mobile suits. They really are idiots! Only insects fly straight into the light! Incoming! I am such a genius! The enemy's mobile suits have moved! Check! Huh...? Those horns and that color... Isn't it the prototype model we used to have? It's fast! Can't get it! Go down! I won! What? SU-Cord... That prototype was sent to Earth for adaptability testing. Why is it so strong in actual combat?! Since the Megafauna is also on the move, I think it's safe to say we've escaped the Dorette Fleet's firing range. I agree, Captain. Please take us to the Moon. The Megafauna's first prisoner of war. What a moment! I guess you could say that. Do you copy? captain Mask, thank you for your work. This great departure is all thanks to your decision, Captain. I'm grateful to you. So you've caught up, damn puppetmaster. What a touching performance from captain Mask. I sent a message tube to the enemy fleet. Our plan is that the Towasanga soldiers will now surrender. You told them youd let them live on Earth? That was Colonel Cumpa's idea. Great work. I appreciate your help, Captain. Until our course is fixed, please keep on alert. Right! Remain on alert until further orders! Chuchumy, they say we're going home. You don't have a headache? Yes, I no longer have cold sweats, either. I'm so glad. Congratulations. ...is it okay if I say that to you? I'm not sure what happened, but I must thank you for taking care of me. Please thank Miss Noredo, not me. Raraiya is talking? Mr. Bellri Zenam. Wow! She is! Good for you! - Yes. - No. No touching. We're going to go take a look at the prisoner. What's with the rubber on your slingshot? I asked them to share with me some of the stuff they use for mobile suits. The stuff I was using on Earth is useless! Ouch! That hurt! Nobody in Towasanga thinks the Earth people are coming. There's no way anyone there can respond to such an unexpected situation. You mean they lack imagination? If they're amateurs, I imagine so. Ringo... what was your name again? Ringo Lon Giamanotta. Second lieutenant. It's no different from the intercontinental wars. No one can predict every possible outcome. Though, they are a nation with an active fleet. I can't imagine they're defenseless. - Bellri. - Yeah? We'll need you to become a commander. Right, Captain? You're not a regular soldier, though. Bellri is still a student soldier. Ah, true. He's right. Dispatching two Alincatos! Keep the Moran team informed, is that clear? Three of the Earth ships are headed to Towasanga. Yes. If we catch them in the homeland, then Towasanga's high-performance machines... You capture them and receive the honor. You don't want to be known for getting promoted through me, do you? With the Alincato's performance, I can do it! There you go, Rockpie. There's no telling when we might be attacked. Spread the net as wide as you can. Don't rely on the Salamandra for anything! Don't forget, that spoiled brat Klim is their combat commander. It seems that you have the Megafauna defending the rear. Are you sure about this? Why would you ask me that? No reason. The captain believes he could receive more praise by returning Miss Aida to the homeland. Am I right? That's not so. It's reassuring to travel with two ships, is all. It takes at least two ships to pose a threat to Towasanga. Let's hope this divides the Dorette Fleet. Because we've offered them the right to live on Earth? Elmorans dispatched. Commander Mashner, please. Thank you. Of course. Rockpie! Dispatching you with the Alincato is no joke. I'm well aware, Commander! Good answer. Show us what you're made of, Rockpie. The Earth people could never imagine the power of this mega beam! Please take care of any enemy machines we let slip away. Leave it fo us' Happa! Are you seriously letting Bellri use this makeshift Assault Pack? I've made its cannons totally foolproof, at least. Is this scope reliable? You can hit them even from the first combat range. Even if it's a lie, it's reassuring to hear you say that. It's no lie. But... We will now commence bombardment from behind our mobile suit team. Go ahead. All gunners, begin barrage! Fire! Any direct hits? What do you think of those explosions? They're awfully light You have a point. The beams are being discharged and the missiles are being made to self destruct? Those Earth people have the nerve to resist us! We'll close in and finish them with a single blow! Earth scum, don't go thinking you'll ever make it to the Moon! At this range, I might end up scoring a direct hit, but... You're the ones coming to attack us! Try not to die! Found her! Here she is! Raraiya! There you are. What were you doing? I can't understand a thing Lieutenant Ringo is saying. What are you on about? The captain asked me to get the specs of the Dorette Fleet's beam cannons from him. Unbelievable. They put a girl like that in the advance team? Dorette forces indeed... nothing they do makes any sense. The beams vanished! They didn't hit! That means we're gonna get taken out! Don't go alone from here on, or you'll get hit! I trust the Assault Pack's performance and Happa's talents! We're done with the computer. Okay! Do you plan on going out there? - I want to see if I can use it. - It's clearly too soon! This is a military suit. Can you handle weapons? For mobile suits, everything up to beam rifles is standard equipment. I can handle them. All hands! This ship will now begin evasive maneuvers! - Steer, hold back a little! - Yes sir! Darn it, Steer! We're forbidden to improve or evolve the Ag-Tech technologies. There's no such taboo in Towasanga?! Okay. Captain, you can sortie last. I won't tail behind you. Yes! They've entered the Alincato's firing range! I can see it! Heat sources, two of them?! Let this hit! Is that them? Don't you die! I'm gonna shoot at you! The Michelle team got taken out?! Is that it?! I'm surrounded! Don't die! What's with that machine?! That's the YG that ended up being rejected! You pilots better bail out! I haven't blown you up! Our Morans were officially adopted over that machine! Please, don't make me use my rifle. There's still more! The YG is fast! Has Raraiya Akuparl sided with the Earth people? Make me use my rifle any more, and you're all gonna die, got it? That's not Raraiya! One of the Earth people is piloting it! That's the team that came from the Salamandra... They're chasing them too far! The G-Self got taken out?! 0h, the suit itself is in one piece, huh? It's dangerous to pursue them! What ahout the heam aimed at the Megafauna? Snipe at the diffused beams! The beam fragments...! Please, go past us! Put up a barrage of beams! Wh-Why?! Raraiya's headed out in the Moran. What?! You let Raraiya pilot?! Raraiya! You forgot to take Chuchumy! There's no telling when we'll take a direct hit! In the end, she ended up piloting the Moran... If it weren't for that net, the Megafauna would have been shot down already! This Hecate that General Gusion got me is pretty darn good! Captain! I missed! However...! I am a genius! I've got them in my sights! Captain Klim and the others are chasing after them, so... At this angle, I can estimate their direction as... Is this about right? I'll shoot, but this is only a warning shot. Don't any of you die! Beams?! Targeting us? It was just a lucky hit! Commander Mashner is supporting me. Could there be one of those legendary Newtypes among the Earth people? There's no way! The group that was pursuing us has pulled back. - Do you read me, Captain? -I do. It seems the G-Self covered for us. captain, your machine's been wounded. Well, I fought a close quarters combat. Do you have any air leaks? - Which is closer? - Huh? Oh, the Megafauna. Can't you tell just by looking? Get some tools over here now! I see you used the Assault Pack to assist us as a sniper. Oh, yeah! Did you enlist with the Amerian Army? I'm still with the Capital Guard. - See? He's not so nice. - Captain. Once your machine is repaired, please return to the Salamandra at once. Understood. What was it that made you want to go to Towasanga? Watch out! To stop the Dorette Fleet. Raraiya, you operated the Moran, didn't you? I was just seeing if I could move it! She's still in rehabilitation, you know? I see. You managed to pilot that, did you? Yes! Do you remember him? Lieutenant Klim. His full name is Klimton Nicchini. - He's a captain now! - And that's Lieutenant Mick Jack. You remember me? What did you bring the Salamandra out for? Because we no longer need to consider Towasanga's existence a taboo. Which means... You want an alliance with the Dorette Fleet? What? Those internal divisions in the Capital Territory made you think of that. Right, Cadet? No! That's not it! Where is it? It's there. I'll take a look. No response from the mobile suits, huh? There's not so much as a peep from Towasanga. It's just like Lieutenant Ringo said. The people of Towasanga must be panicked over this unexpected occurrence, right? Is that right, Lieutenant? Huh? Oh, yeah! There's a lot going on between the government and the Dorette family. It's in sight now! - What is that? - Is that a toy? That shining pillar is Cyrano-5. It's surrounded by ring-shaped space colonies. That's Towasanga, our home. Where do we go in from? We could go in from the southern ring. Gisela, can we go into port? Hold on a moment. You were part of the resistance, huh? Wrong. I thought I didn't see you! We made it! - Captain! - The prisoner is serving as our guide. This is it? Doesn't this shape expend too much energy? They gave us the go ahead. Matching inertial gravity. Accelerate slightly. Just slightly. No offensive moves from here on. From close by, though it's merely one ring there's enough room for people to live. The opening ahead is a port entrance. A barrier, you mean. Are you sure we won't hit it? We still have one kilometer's clearance. Take us back to starboard. Are we going into #4? Because it's the brightest pier. The Megafauna is going into #1. Huh? Where is this? It's your homeland, isn't it? I've never been to this port. Don't joke around! Isn't this port awfully rusty? I don't see any Towasangan mobile suits around here either. Princess, don't you think this could be a trap? Do you think? Wel... Cyrano-5... ..ank you fo... making... tri.. Plea... enj... your sta... I'm surprised you got it open. It was universal standard. This thing? It's an imitation of a rustic town. You're right. - There's mobile suits! - Don't look at them! Is the cloud of dust coming from up above? What kind of moron uses beams inside a space colony?! Get out of your machine. Or would you rather be roasted alive inside your cockpit? Why you...! We'll seize your weapons and use them for ourselves. Was there a tremor just now? I think I felt one. There's no need to get out in a wasteland like this. She wants to set her feet on her native soil as soon as she can. I'm home! South Cyrano is... Towasanga! I see! This is Maloy! Raraiya, have the YG crouch down. That G-type and the boxy one, too. - Have them crouch down. - Sis! It really is you, Raraiya! Flami! What are you doing in a place like this? we'll talk later. Towasanga's Zacks units are out over there. Bell! Miss Aida! Crouch down! Crouch down! You too, Mr. Kerbes! What's up? This is my neighbor, Ms. Flaminia Kalle. Flami, they headed back towards the pier. Good to hear. Is that you, Raraiya? It is! - Ms. Flaminia? - Hi! I'm Aida Surugan. Call me Flami. Nice to meet you. I'm Noredo Nug. I'm Bellri Zenam. There is someone I would like you to meet. I think they're preoccupied at the moment, so this is our chance. Someone you want us to meet? Here? - Yes. - Sis. It would be best to have the YG and the others lie down. Yeah. Let's have the mobile suits lie down in the trees here. You want them to lie down? When you play hide and seek, do you hide standing up? We have comrades here. We'll work something out. On the other side of the tall dividing wall lies a field of olives. Compared to the land we saw earlier, these fields are... The cultivation of hemp and sesame has been permitted recently. Why is that? Because this was Rayhunton family land. Rayhunton? Rayhunton land? Why is this place lower than the rest? This used to be underground. But then it caved in... You can enter this way. Do you think maybe it's outer space right beneath us? Looks like. - Mr. Lorucca, I've brought them. - It was operator error. So I'll have the paperwork delivered to you tomorrow. Is that acceptable? Please, have a seat. Right. You've really been through a lot, Raraiya. It must have been hard. It's good of you to come all this way. - I am Miraji Barbaros. - Donyell Toss. Please, take a seat... Or perhaps you should get changed first? Yeah, let's do that. Please do, Princess! Prince! What... did you call us? Before I explain, you should look at your family home. Yes, that will certainly help them understand. What.. are they talking about? Even a single piece of toilet paper is a precious commodity here! What do you think you're doing, releasing a container? Deck Chief, have them put their backs into it! Turn on the magnets in your boots and dig your heels in! - Captain. - Yeah? From this close, don't the solar panels on the lunar surface look like they take up a huge area? That's right. Even though they're on uninhabitable land, this is still a destruction of nature. During the long history including the Universal Century, they had enough time to build a space colony like Cyrano-5. Was it built using asteroid resources? Yes. It looks like a lantern. They say the central asteroid looks like Cyrano de Bergerac's nose. The name Cyrano-5 comes from the five rings. Keep it up, we're almost there! Got it! We got it! Keep it down! This commotion is uncalled for. I don't believe it. This is the children's room. Children's room? Please tell me. What's going on here? Are you trying to say that was mine? You used to fall out of it all the time. Let's pull these down. Almost! Pull that one too. Yes! Ah, this air... It feels somewhat familiar. What is that? There they are. They were here... all along. I always missed something... though I couldn't remember what it was. I've always wondered... what I had forgotten. Miss Aida. I've only known my mother and father. My mother said she threw out all my father's data and pictures. These pictures are from the same time. They are your parents. This picture that Lorucca kept is the only one remaining. All other data was deleted by the Dorette family. What's that? It was inside the cabinet on top of the bookshelf. - Looks good. - That's the last of them. Thanks! You two were sent to Earth as refugees on Captain Piani Kaluta's orders. There, you were treated as orphans. He said it would be safer if none of us knew where you were. However, we wanted to eventually find you, so we used the G-Self as a means to do that. You mean, the Rayhunton Code. The first time I touched the G-Self... You have one of these too, Miss Aida. Yes! I have the same pendant. The touch sensor uses sweat and blood to identify DNA. Retina and fingerprint scans also allow direct descendants of the Rayhuntons to activate the G-Self. I understand what transpired now. In other words, Bellri and I have suffered through tremendous hardships because of what you planned. Of course, some of that may have been caused by the dispositions we inherited from the Surugan and Zenam families who raised us. However, because we were able to pilot the G-Self, I lost my lover, and Bellri, my brother, is now a murderer. Though you have your duties, and ideals you pursue, I will find my own ideals and attain them. Sis. It's not up to older people to create the new age. Well, it must be a nation with the industrial capacity to send out the Dorette Fleet. We've entered Towasanga territory. All mobile suits take up alert positions. What is it? Do you trust Colonel Cumpa? It's precisely because I trust him that I could come here, leaving the Dorette Fleet surrounding Capital Tower. captain! I've heard this ship will be surrendering fo the Towasangan forces. Don't use radio! We're already in Towasanga's airspace. Right. If we want to take their military power back with us, we need to become their allies temporarily. That's the plan? Exactly. Manny Ambassada, take the utmost caution. Y-Yes, Captain! That's my schoolmate! Hmph, Mask is soft on that woman, is he? What does this all mean!? Darn it! How am I to accept it, just because the G-Self is evidence of the fact? That Aida Surugan is... Miss Aida is my sister! How is this even real!? That boy has saved me and the Megafauna many times. But that's also his duty. Why can't I think about it like that? Cahill... he's the one that killed you. How can I accept this? I was made to work for the interests of the adults! I'm the one who fights with lives on the line! I boarded the Megafauna for Miss Aida. For her to be my actual sister! I rode the G-Self, which proves our relationship, using all these new backpacks! I was conceited that I was such a genius! What a joke! Beep. Bellri! Found you, Bell! - Health check! - Be quiet, will you? Hey, how long have you been watching me? I've been looking for you. Really, now. Go back inside. Miss Aida misses you. Huh? You're disgusted that she's your sister. To tell you the truth, I thought this meant I'd won. Sorry, Bell. Please forget everything I just said. How embarrassing. Noredo... Go. She's waiting on the balcony. Yeah... thanks. Lieutenant Kerbes has confirmed the situation. Without a doubt, the Space Garanden is entering port. Why is that? The Crescent Ship and Kashiba Mikoshi will be leaving soon. Is the Crescent returning to Ocean Ring? Crescent Ship, Kashiba... Ocean Ring? Why did you laugh? I'm a little envious. Since you have Miss Noredo. I need to apologize again. I'm so sorry. Don't worry about it anymore, really. Well, I, too... I gave you assignments that were like suicide missions as if to avenge his death. Thank you for keeping everyone safe until today. Cahill told me... to let you know you're doing great. Isn't he the one who could have reformed the Amerian Army? Yes. He was a really great man. I'm glad. Don't we need to head out as well? The Gavan team is in charge of security here. Won't the Amerian Army get the jump on us? Why do you think that? Ameria's Salamandra is being treated as an honored guest by military HQ. The Capital Army's Garanden will be our enemy, too. Listen... If we let them into port here, then both of them are ours. Why can't you understand these things? We seem to be welcome because you're the President's son, Captain Klim. They treat me as a guest... but it seems the Garanden isn't so welcome. You'll be pushed around by their interests. Rather, I'll push them around. What? You mean... You're planning to take over the Knossos? We are at the transfer station for photon batteries. You'll take over the entire government. Don't say it out loud. You want to go see it yourself? - I'm sorry! - Bellri, there's no order to sortie! Adam, why didn't you stop him? He said he was going to see the Garanden. Mr. Happa! Inside this outer wall, there are forests, farms built on caved in land, even the house where we were born? While I see the Earth there. What about the Garanden? G-Self, this is a homecoming for you too, so bring me up a map! Where's the Apache Military Port? Here? How did the Garanden get here? I thought Mask was going to engage the Dorette Fleet. YG-111 identified. Do you hear me, Gavan team? He left from South Ring #5? That suit was used by Raraiya Akupar/ when she was sent to do advance recon for Operation Reconguisia. Yeah. 1st and 2nd squadrons, follow me. 3rd squadron, watch the Garanden and guide them in! Yes sir! Why did you send Bell out alone? No one gave him permission. Lieutenant, please go drag Bellri back here. That's the plan. But why are Towasanga suits welcoming the Garanden? They hate them! The guys who were left behind hate the ones in the fleet. - Right? - They do? I'm borrowing the Moran! Raraiya? Raraiya Akuparl! What are you doing returning without a report? "Returning without a report?” What? Judging from your lack of response, it's an Earth person piloting that machine! What?! It won't blow up?! I was born here! Get him away from the ring! You trash! I won't kill you. But if you get in our way ever again, there will be no such mercy! I have a sister, you know, so next time I'll do it! Bell! Bellri! We're returning! Are you okay? We heard everything. Iwas watching on the long-range monitor. You shut those Zacks units up in no time. I'm happy for you as your former instructor, but how did you do it? I just scratched the machines. Nothing could have happened to the pilots. I didn't do anything like that, Sis! W-We understand that. You did well. This is bad. You can't show the Towasangan forces this kind of firepower! So don't use the G-Self anymore. - Bellri! - Y-Yes sir! I won't do that. Bellri, you re okay, right? Th-Thanks. I'm fine. We must let the Megafauna escape. Otherwise, Towasanga will confiscate it. Lieutenant Kerbes, what do you think? I agree. The Garanden's permission to dock is questionable, as well. There's no way the Earth people could build this on their own. They say a lot of engineers have illegally emigrated from here to Earth. Prime Minister Hazm is here to greet them? I hear Commander Zurchin is coming too. I heard General Dorette ordered them to do so. To win the intercontinental war on Earth. Will Towasanga help the Capital Tower? It's good of you to come all this way. For the kind treatment of the Hazm administration and your military, you have my heartfelt thanks. This is the time of year when the Kashiba Mikoshi descends, - so we aren't sufficiently prepared to-- - Prime Minister. - You are before guests. - Oh, yes. If anything does not meet your satisfaction, please, tell the person in charge. What became of the ship which came before ours, the Megafauna? They're waiting to dock. - The Salamandra is coming in first. - The Megafauna has gone out to clean up the debris from the floor collapse. You want us to dispatch our mobile suits, too? The guys from the Kashiba Mikoshi at the Big Pier seem to have complained. Complaints from the Hermes Foundation? It happens every now and then. This time, the Crescent Ship is still at the Big Pier. That's what the commotion is about. Precisely. I am Colonel Kragen of the Towasangan forces. I am known as Captain Mask. The Amerian Army has told me about you. Yes. The floor-collapse incident has created much confusion, but you report directly to the Capital Tower and are therefore closely related to us, so I wish to lend you a hand. I am very grateful. So this is the debris from the floor collapse. Something like this happens every few years. Do not let the debris enter the Big Pier! Don't let it enter the Big Pier? But the Big Pier is... All units! Return to the deck for now. We will brief you on the debris clean-up operation. Use more balloons to keep the debris away. All hands, we will now begin this assignment from the Towasangan government. Do all you can during maintenance. I'm so glad it didn't get damaged! This is a great machine. Raraiya, your machine's been delivered to the rear hangar! Thank you! That's a Neodu. It's from Ms. Flami! They lent us this machine when you suggested taking back the G-Self. They're testing our abilities. Can you pilot it? With 20 or 30 minutes of practice, yes. Invoice from Towasanga... I hate this! That man... what is he doing there? The Dorette Fleet wishes to absorb us, along with our crew. Our soldiers are at a different level. However, we might as well consider using Towasanga as a Capital Army base. Manny! Were you listening? Huh? Lieutenant Barara, your Bifron is ready. Thank you. Is that pink thing a space ship? I thought it was a part of Cyrano-5. It's the Kashiba Mikoshi, which is also an object of SU-Cordist worship. The space craft outside the port... That's the Crescent Ship. It's owned by the Hermes Foundation. It's my first time seeing it. The Crescent Ship takes a couple of days for idling. It will then set a course for the Venus Globe. The photon batteries are manufactured there. That's why they're so insistent about the clean-up. In that case, we must cooperate. Why not just return to Earth? I don't want to be absorbed by the Dorette Fleet. We can't disavow the Regild Century. Yes, as you say. It's Colonel Cumpa Rusita who made that proposal... That can't be! and he's from here! If the Garanden dispatches mobile suits... The Hermes Foundation's Crescent Ship Is returning to the Venus Globe? That will be trouble. Raraiya, you can pilot the machine that was just delivered. It's called a Neodu. We have to clean up the debris, but... We'll find a way to escape Towasanga while doing that. Captain. We'll use the debris as shields. That's right! - Prince Bellri... - And Princess Aida as well. So thats... the rose-blossom gene of the Rayhuntons? All hands, follow the first boatswain! Hold on. Why should we!? It's not built well. I'll do a shakedown after I've launched. The Bifron is launching from the Garanden. Shall we? I expect no less from mobile suits developed by Towasanga. I'm impressed that even a model like that is serviceable. It's running well. A test run! Passing the Gel Curtain. There it goes! It looks like Mask is heading out as her guardian. How kind of him. I wish I were as lucky as she is. Then, shall we go on an outing with them? Don't go off course. Roger. I see! Captain Mask is using Lieutenant Barara as a weapon. But he isn't that callous... Be safe. Move out of the way, the launch is taking off! 0-Okay! Have these mobile suits clean up the debris! The enemy ship is in front of us, isn't it? Commander, the Bifron is a test model! That's why we're trying it out by having it do clean-up work. Please cancel your orders to clean up the debris, Commander Mashner! If you defy my orders... The Kashiba Mikoshi says to hurry with the cleanup? The Bifron that left the Garanden Is on its way fo capture the G-Self! Your Hecate is without a doubt designed by Towasanga engineers! So what!? It was the Amerian Army that built it! - We are... - The Hermes Foundation envoys... are yelling that the Crescent Ship will get scratched! Just what kind of people are they? That's no concern for Earth people. Captain Klim, don't let the Capital Army touch the Megafauna and the G-Self! That's my plan! Let's go, Mick! Ready! Rockpie, clean up the debris. Help the Hermes Foundation save face! Roger, roger, roger! Ah! Miss Raraiya! Are you really planning to go out in that? I learned to pilot in this. The G-Self and Arcane will go out the front. We can return to the Megafauna any time. Okay! The Crescent Ship will be leaving Cyrano-5, won't it? It's already en route to the Venus Globe. While the Megafauna circles Cyrano-5. All mobile suits, head directly to the front of the Big Pier, and get to the debris cleanup! Ringo! - The Neodu! - I'm going out! Wh-What's this output?! Th-The controls! My hands! My hands! Miss Raraiya, what's wrong? What? A Towasangan mobile suit? What? Miss Raraiya! Why'd she engage that mobile suit? Be careful. Barara, Stephan! Enemies aren't just coming from the front! The Neodu ran into something. Where's Bellri? Oh, the G-Self has found the Neodu. Okay! Kerbes, Oliver, bring back the princess. Lieutenant Kerbes, why did you let her out? Captain, weren't those your orders? Hurry up! Don't make a fool out of me! Raraiya! Barara, here it comes! Klim! I'm going to snipe him! It's Genius Klim! I'll intercept him! The Towasangan mobile suit is mine! I'm being attacked by an Amerian suit?! That stupid huge thing! I understand. You and Lieutenant Kerbes, keep 360 degree watch. I won't let you get away! I've lost my monitor as well! I can do it with the welding beam! You can't do that. A cleanup team is coming over here from Cyrano-5! Don't shoot! It's a warning from the debris cleanup team. Is fighting all you do, Earth people!? Think about the implications! I can hear him over the contact link? He wants us to help with the cleanup? If you anger the Hermes Foundation, you'll receive no photon batteries! Listen, the Crescent Ship and Kashiba Mikoshi are Hermes Foundation ships on which they transport photon batteries, so we mustn't let so much as a pebble scratch them! Go! Well then, in the name of peace for all humanity! Agh! Not you too, Miss Raraiya! Is the 111 coming? Use the nets closer to Cyrano-5's Meteor Pillar. Oh no! They beat us to it! Mask, are we going fo do it? We can't let the G-Self beat us! Captain Klim! Right, Mick! If we're going to do this, we have to win! Energy sources are our lifeline, after all. Mr. Ringo, you're too slow. The Megafauna will circle around Cyrano-5. Don't let your guard down. Oliver! Luan! We have no idea... What Towasanga is planning. A spaceship carrying photon batteries. That is...? Enlarge image. A commander machine? I'll return with haste, Commander. Yes, I'll explain once I'm back. Friend or foe, we're all cleaning up. What a heartwarming sight. This is our chance to contact them. Can we enter it? All emergency exits are universal standard. There's people down below. -Tll be back soon. - Roger. - Leave one launch! - Yes. Flaminia, leave one vessel here. Place it where it won't be in the way. - What about leak checks? - Did you perform the nozzle check? I couldn't believe it when I saw the news. Since you are still in good health, Mr. Lorucca Biskes, did you install a nuclear self destruct device in the G-Self, I wonder? You were the one who violated the Hermes taboo! You provoked the Earth People to war! Ms. Flaminia! Oh, what is it? Did someone come in through that emergency hatch? Who do you mean by someone? I'll go check. Until the G-Self appeared, I had no idea where the children abandoned on Earth were being raised. What? What you've done is far worse than what I did. You're just making people hate each other, like they did in the old centuries-- That's not it. It is true. The thinking of specialists is always too linear. It's Colonel Cumpa Rusita! I look forward to your exploits! Piani Kaluta! Piani Kaluta? Princess, forgive us! You mean, the conflict between the Dorettes and the Rayhuntons... is because of the Hermes Foundation? N-no, this is a Towasangan internal problem. Do you think this problem can be solved by discussions between opposing sides? Huh...? Right. Can you ask the Hermes Foundation to mediate? - H-Hold on. - Ms. Flaminia. I wanted to ask you something about the list. You even supplied us with spare backpacks for the G-Self. Rockpie, if you don't stop the Gavan team, there will be trouble! Please, wait a moment longer. There's no way I can pilot the Gaitrash so suddenly. We can't use rifles. I know! What about its maintenance!? There are 30 electrodes to deal with here! Are you sure about this? It will be done before we reach the outside. Weigh anchor! Passing the Gel Curtain! Is that true? The Gavan team's honor depends on capturing the YG-111. Take in the YG-111 before the Gavan team can! Roger that! I'm heading out! I'll test the beam manteau. That was 10% output. If I get serious-- Don't break the YG! You're there to capture it! Yes! Understood! Bellri, stand down. Mr. Kerbes, pull me up. Mr. Ringo, pull me up. I'll suspend it from the wire. How's that!? I'll have it wrapped in a dummy balloon next time. Will it hold? Now it's just about collecting the pieces. What is it? Can you hear me through the contact link? Bellri? Yes! There's no more time for clean-up! I heard the communication between the Gavan team patrolling the area. They plan to capture the G-Self. Miss Raraiya, report that to the Megafauna! Sure! The G-Self showed off its performance! Will Mask come for it, too? He will. Can the Megafauna get away? The G-Self is back on board. Can I leave the Neodu like this? Yes! That was a Knossos-class from the Apache Military Port! The Gavan team is approaching, too. On the other side of the debris... Mobile suits! I see them. Are they after us? Mask and Captain Klim might have provoked them. Even a warship is here! Couldn't Colonel Cumpa Rusita has done something about it? What about it? It's a fight among three opposing forces. Gavan! You punks are planning to attack once the Earth people gain distance from Cyrano-5! This is no business of yours, fleet guys! If you spread Minovsky particles, I'll stop you, no matter what! All hands, get ready! The Crescent Ship is drifting through there? If we accelerate, they'll attack us! A Mack Knife! It's here! - I apen the hatch. - Go ahead. Someone came out of the Mack Knife! Camera! That's...! - You've got to be kidding me! - What is it? What have you come here to-- You can't use radar, so you have to look around better. It's universal standard, so... Adam Smith, we have hostiles coming from the front. But there's a Mack Knife and that big thing out front. They're taking aim at us. Another team is following after them. That must be Klim then. Accelerate the Megafauna. We're going after the Crescent Ship. Yes. That way, we can't fire on each other. You want to board the Crescent Ship, don't you? If possible. - Is that... - The princess? - Will you be heading out? - Of course. Do you think we can get out? They might target the bridge. The intruders are attempting to open the gate. Send out the Grimoires on the rear deck. You wanted this one, right? The hatch opened! Move the crane out of the way. That person in the pilot suit... The airlock is on the starboard side, right? Yes. This way, hurry! Okay! Mask! The G-Self was constructed in Towasanga, so you have to give it back! It is you, Manny! Why did you come here like this? Because! If we give the G-Self back to Towasanga, they say all three of our ships can go back to Earth! They'll resupply the Megafauna and Garanden as well! No can do! The G-Self belongs to me and Miss Aida! What? Manny! Do you read me over the contact link? Please, take shelter deeper inside. - Why? - Behind the Mack Knife?! Stop! What are you doing? Don't you know you're on the Megafauna's deck? It's the Hecate and Jahannam. Ms. Mick and Captain Klim? We're right next to the Crescent Ship! What is wrong with you Earth people?! The Salamandra's genius and the assault girl, huh? Coming late to the party... You can't fight a close quarters battle in something like that! Don't underestimate me! Impossible! I told you not to underestimate me! Barara, calm down! Towasanga's forces are approaching, too! Don't let Towasanga take advantage of this fight. Also, keep the Hermes Foundation away! But there's a Knossos out as well. What? Looks like there's some infighting aboard the Megafauna. We can't let this get out of hand, Mashner! I'm well aware. If a beam were to scratch the Crescent Ship while the Foundation envoys are watching, our military would be disbanded at once. Rockpie, the Gavan team is advancing. You know what to do, don't you? This is my defense area. I can't let these Earth people do as they please here! Noredo, take shelter as close to the center of the ship as you can. You too, Manny! Those people... Manny, this way! But...! Bellri, what are you doing? I'll pull some dummy asteroids in front of the hangar! Iget it! I'll help! Two Grimoires to the front. Close the hatch. The Arcane has headed out. Wh-What? No! I can't see ahead! Gisela! Don't you have a monitor for Steer? A monitor for looking ahead? There should be one. They're here. Curse you, woman! I won't forgive you for kicking my Captain! If a man gets kicked, it's his own fault! Okay, I've hooked up the center camera to this. So you can see what's in front of us! What? It's tiny! It's cushioning their fall. Raraiya, we can just tie them down lightly. I know! This isn't your playground! These guys...! Gavan, you hooligan, relying on numbers! I have no time for Mashner's boytoy! Towasanga's people won't use rifles. They're SU-Cordist believers, after all. Capture the ones above too! It grabbed me?! You should've just stayed with your doting Mashner-- He cut me! Capturing the 111 is my duty. That Earth person used missiles?! Captain! I had no other choice to save you, Barara! C-Captain. I was about to lose to their superior numbers. The Megafauna's accelerating! Can you see it, Captain? It's in sight now, yeah? Gisela, XO! 23 degrees up. You're wrong! Sh-She is? 30 degrees up, 3 degrees to port will take us right behind the Crescent Ship. Okay! - Steer! - Aye-aye! - Maximum speed! - Yes, sir! - They're ahead of us. - Right! The Crescent Ship?! Thank you, Bridge. Bellri, the Megafauna will join up with the Crescent Ship. Join up? If the G-Self leaves, they won't target the Megafauna! The G-Self has come out! Mask! You've come out for me to catch you, have you? But, there's these Towasangans! He got me! Filthy Earth people! Huh? Mashner has come out? Mashner, s-s-stop it! As combat commander, I order you to fire! Mashner, stop! Fire #3 and #4 as well! Are you trying to get me executed?! Do you think they'd stop if asked nicely?! Good, the pilot got away. Is the Crescent Ship over there? I'll take the 111 with me! G-Self, let Colonel Cumpa analyze your machine! Bellri! The G-Self will be a valuable hostage, so lend it to me! You're all here to fight over it! I will not let you people have it! Now you've done it, Earth person. Mashner, back me up! The beam interference is spreading! We're being flung away! The 111 has changed! Go back to your homelands! I've got the output now! They're closing in on the Crescent Ship! Stop Rockpie! It's still idling now. But it's already on course to the Venus Globe. The princess plans to ride that thing. Maximum combat speed! What?! Steer, you made us fire! Plasma equalization barrier, Lieutenant! To destroy it... We must concentrate all our fire! The barrier has formed a belt around it. Plasma equalization, maybe? It's coming! It's going to catch up to us! Aim at the shining part! Make it! Is this guy a monster? End of the line, 111 pilot! G-Self, photon shield! Please, don't get close to the Crescent Ship! - We'll be cursed! - Maximum combat speed! Stop, please, Captain! - Let's decelerate! - No! Go to our maximum-maximum combat speed! Rockpie's putting his life on the line, so we have to save him! Is this that beam coating stuff? It's blocking the Gaitrash's beam saber with its hands! The G-Self's body itself became a reflector... but where did the absorbed energy go!? Energy... down!? D-Darn it! R-Recaoil! Raraiya, cut the wires on the dummy asteroids! Steer! Do you get it? Oh, my SU-Cord! Steer! Don't use auto! - Easy. Easy. Easy. - Gisela, you too! Princess, we're going to hit it! Let's make sure we don't! Miss Raraiya! Right! Don't fall, okay? Ms. Steer! The starboard side! No! Reverse thrusters, Steer! Yes sir! Did we get through? Dodge, Bellri! What!? The bridge! What... Rockpie! - They're going to court-martial us! - Rock, are you alive?! Commander! I- did the very best I could! - I'm sure you did! - It's ahead of us! - I know that, Rock. - Either evade it or shoot! Rockpie! Verify file. Is it talking about this? Then... verify file. This must be the engine room. This pattern! I get it! The shape is identical, it's not even a joke! Although, I still don't get what to do now... Bellri! Sis! Are you hurt? You brought the G-Self into the engine room?! But--! Verify file. Again? Let's get our file verified. Rayhunton Legend Code confirmed. Confirmed? This room responded to us. It verified and confirmed. Yes. What do we do next? Execution, isn't it? Yes, you already have the metal in your hand. Now, execute! There must be a metal insertion slit somewhere. This computer must be programmed with visual learning computations. Found it! Regular operation, start up. What's going on!? My metal is trembling... it's responding! Don't take it off! It's acting just like yours, Bellri! Now, the first answer. Please enjoy your trip to the Venus Globe. - To the cockpit. - Yes. This part was responding, too. A rose blossom? A reference to a rose? Yes. It wants us to go to the Venus Globe. What is it? Sis, you're pretty. Indeed, I am. You're something else. Aye-aye. Ow! Watch it! Just give up already. I'm a Capital Army member, you know. Look at you. Hey, that tickles! There's people. Departure...? Translation and Subtitling: Iyuno-SDI Group
