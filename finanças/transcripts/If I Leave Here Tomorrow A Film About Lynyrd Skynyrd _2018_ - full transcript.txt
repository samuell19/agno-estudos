The plane apparently was running low on fuel and tried to make an emergency landing, clipped some treetops and crashed into a swamp. I just want to straighten out that there's not a person by the name of Lynyrd Skynyrd, for those who are not so informed, and therefore that person cannot die. Ronnie Van Zant was the leader and the vocals you usually heard from Lynyrd Skynyrd, and he was one of the six killed in the wreck, and that's about the latest we have on it right now. - Ronnie, he called himself the Mississippi Kid. I never understood that 'cause I'm from Mississippi, and I asked him about that one time. I said, "Ronnie, you know, wh--" and he said, "I don't know," but he died in Mississippi. See? His songs were really prophetic. Everything he ever wrote was true. It was a true story, or it came true later. Ronnie Van Zant, he's a prophet. ♪ ♪ - Man, a lot of this I haven't been to. - Well, it's all changed in this area. - I miss the moss. There's no moss in Jackson or Atlanta. I never see it, anyway. I love moss. It's crazy, man, how long it's been. - I know. - The stories from the original band was 52 years ago. Most people can't remember that far back, let alone rock-and-rollers. ♪ ♪ So we came down to a baseball game here to watch Ronnie. He was on a baseball team called the Green Pigs. Ronnie got up and went bam and hit a line drive right to Bob Burns' temple. Boom, it hit him. - Looked like a aspirin coming straight to me, and I wheeled around to-- to turn, try to miss it, and it caught me right behind the shoulder blades and took every breath I ever had in my whole life, and I think Gary said it hit me in the head, but I--maybe it should have. - So everybody running over. "Oh, you killed this guy. It's go--" you know, we thought he was dead. - And Ronnie walked up and looks down there. He got this Mona Lisa type grin, you know? Like, a, "Well, I'm trying to act serious, but actually, I think it's funny as hell," kind of look, you know? And he went, "Sorry, kid." - It came up that I had a guitar, and Bob played drums, and we said, "Ronnie, we know you sing. Why don't you come sing a song with us?" and he went, "Yeah, let's go," and we went down to Bob Burns' carport and played, I think, "Time Is On My Side" that day after the ballgame. We went, "Wow, this is great. Let's start a band," you know? - ♪ Like to tell you all a story ♪ ♪ About a friend of mine ♪ - And I was just still learning the chords and stuff. We said, "Let's get somebody that's got a guitar." It didn't matter who, just that they owned the equipment, and Allen Collins was in a band called the Mods. He had a amp and guitar, so we went looking for him, and he was riding his bike, and he saw Ronnie in the car and went riding his bike through the woods and climbed a tree way up tall so we couldn't get him. He thought we were gonna beat him up, or Ronnie was, and Bob had a little bit of a reputation too, you know? And we said, "No, no, Allen. Come down. We want you to play in a band," you know? - Ronnie kind of raised Gary and Allen. Their fathers was gone. - So we kind of were a family, and I mean, Ronnie kind of taught me and Allen how to drive. He was three years older, so he taught us all that stuff you learn when you're 14, 15, 16, driving and girls. - He took care of the band just like a father would a family, you know? - And I wasn't real athletic, and I ended up playing in the school band, clarinet and then later saxophone, and I got tired of marching around all football fields, and one Friday night I decided I'd rather play teen dances, and that's when I got with Ronnie and the boys. Besides Bob Burns, Allen was the next-craziest person on the face of the earth. - We all wanted Allen's bellbottoms. His sister made them. He was so tall and skinny, they looked good on him. If we would have tried them, they'd have been way too big and looked goofy on us. Allen was really loud, and when he came in the room, you knew it. He'd knock stuff over. - He used to sniff glue when we first met him. We could put a model airplane together with his breath. - Everybody took speed back then, little uppers. It was hard keeping a girlfriend or going to school or anything, learning stuff, 'cause we just wanted to play guitar all night. Allen and I used to talk. We wished we could get thrown in jail with a guitar so that's all we could do, is play. Seventh, eighth grade, and we were just playing to teen dens and garages for people at school. They'd throw weekend parties, you know? And I quit sports, and we quit baseball, and just music, music, guitar, guitar, guitar, that's all we thought, you know? - We used to be called The 1%. Here's our first band card. It says the 1%. That's--was made in '64 or '65. - That was our home phone number. - Most everybody went to the high school here. I just went to tenth grade. - Then Leonard Skinner kicked me out. After gym every day you'd be getting dressed, and he'd walk through the dressing room checking your hair. If it touched your eyebrow or touched the top of your ear, it was too long. That was the rules, and he'd see that, and he'd kick you out to go get a haircut, and finally one day I just said, "I ain't coming back." - There was a song called "Camp Grenada." - ♪ Hello muddah, hello faddah ♪ ♪ Here I am at Camp Granada ♪ - ♪ Camp Granada ♪ - ♪ You remember Leonard Skinnerd ♪ ♪ He got ptomaine poisoning last night after dinner ♪ - That's where I heard the name from; it's in there. I laughed my ass off. A door would blow open. Nobody's there. "What the hell is--" "That's Leonard Skinnerd." They'd start laughing. They picked up on it a little bit, and they'd use it. Somebody's on the phone. Nobody's talking, see? Leonard Skinnerd. A noise over there, and there ain't nothing over there, it's Leonard Skinnerd. The dangedest thing happened. A year and a half later Gary got Leonard Skinner as a gym coach, and he was making them cut their hair, and here we were trying to be rock legends, see? Ronnie decided it was time to change the name 'cause some of the people were saying 1% talent, and it pissed him off, so when we were thinking of names, I said, "Leonard Skinnerd." They said, "Where?" I said, "No, Leonard Skinnerd." They said, "Well, where, Bob?" "Name of the band!" and they--everybody just busted out laughing, and Ronnie said, "By God, that's it. You know, that is it." ♪ ♪ - I was in this band, the Strawberry Alarm Clock, west coast band. We had a number-one record in the fall of '67. I had been to the South before with the Beach Boys, but you don't really see much when you're just going from hotel to gig, and I really liked what was going on down there. It was a lot more real than L.A. was. It just seemed, like, really down to earth, and I figured if there was any real good rock music happening, it probably had to be down there. When I saw Skynyrd play the first time, and I really liked them, particularly the lead singer, Ronnie. He was just so charismatic, and music just seemed to flow out of him, and I said, "Well, you guys got to keep on writing," you know, and a couple weeks later he called me at my hotel room, and he said, "I want you to come down to this club "called the Comic Book. We're rehearsing down there. We wrote a new song, want you to hear it." So I went right down, and they played me this song called "Need All My Friends," and a chill went down my back.

After I graduated from high school, I left home and ended up down here, and I was ready to get out of Waycross, Georgia, and I met Ronnie, and we were together, like, nine years. When I met Ronnie, he was working at Morris Auto Supplies as his day job. As you can see in the picture, he has on a wig 'cause you couldn't go to work with long hair. Dean Kilpatrick was my roommate, and I went over to the Comic Book Club with Dean. I met Gary first and then hung out with Gary and Dean, and then I met Ronnie, and, you know, after that was it, you know? - ♪ Woman of mine ♪ ♪ Can't let her go ♪ - I know they were good, and I knew that they were passionate, and, you know, that's kind of why I told Ronnie to quit his job, and I worked, and he got to do what he needed to do. Musicians are a rare breed. It's, like, you know, it gets in their blood. They have to just go after it. That's Dean in drag. Dean was a character. - I guess so. - Dean actually dressed better in--like, in the band, and he looked like the rock star. He took--personally took care of everybody. Dean was the personal assistant. I guess that's a good title for him. - He was from New York City and kind of wild and knew all the ins and outs of city life that we didn't know. He was, like, a bartender roadie where he took care of us really good, you know? Anybody who was sick or needed a little more attention, you know, he was just there for you. He was like the big brother and sister and your mama and everything. I got a picture of him I keep out over there. I put it away recently 'cause some--certain times I start missing people, and it's hard to see them every day without crying, and he was just a real great guy. - As far as Ronnie, I go back before Gary and Allen and Bob and We used to play a lot of sandlot and hang out at the racetrack. I mean, what's better for 12-year-old kids than having a racetrack in your neighborhood, you know? And we were what you called west side. We called it shantytown. It was woods and swamps. People were blue collar, and a lot of people didn't get out of high school. There was a lot of people we grew up with didn't probably get out of junior high school. - ♪ Have you ever lived down in the ghetto? ♪ ♪ Have you felt the cold wind blow? ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ If you don't know what I mean ♪ ♪ Won't you stand up and scream ♪ ♪ 'Cause there's things going on that you don't know ♪ - Look down here.

Y'all need to lock your cars out here. - Ha ha! - Wow, it freaks me out, Gary. - I know. I ain't been over here in I don't know when. - It just don't seem the same. - Yeah, I know. This is the old trophy room where daddy had all the gold records, and everything was in here. - Daddy loved the music stuff, but my mom didn't care two bits about it. She was like, "Oh, them damn boys. When you gonna get a real job?" - "They'll just play that music for a while. They'll grow up." Growing up in the west side, it was a bad area of town. There was a lot of rednecks, and, you know, being in a band and having long hair, people didn't like us, and they would come to fight and see who could beat each other. Ronnie was quite the choice before he got into music. Basically, Ronnie was into kicking ass. - He wasn't scared of situations, you know? If there was ten guys coming at you with clubs, he just walked right to them. Jacksonville's got, like, five or six different navy bases, so we'd play a lot for sailors. Now, what does a sailor want to do besides be with a chick? Fight. So we had to fight our way out every night, and Ronnie would always win. Yeah, he was a great boxer. - You know, it's not manly. When you went to school, you know, the athlete guys and stuff didn't do poetry, but Ronnie started making up poems about sports. He used to put them in a three-ring binder. He used to have that under his bed. I remember spending the night under there, and he'd have his poetry in there. I can't say I knew another guy that was writing poetry when I was in high school, you know? I mean. - We tried to write common songs, well, com--for common people, for the street people, and all the guys in Lynyrd Skynyrd are nothing but street people, stay off the streets, Skid Row, the whole works, and it's very easy for us, you know, to relate to that, you know? We relate to that much more than anything else. - Lynyrd Skynyrd's home, of course, was not Alabama. It was Jacksonville, and the group did not become a success overnight. In the beginning, back in the early 1960s, there were no fancy recording studios or gold albums. The group did a lot of their rehearsing right here in this field in Green Cove Springs. - You ever come out to the Hell House much? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember it was a piece of crap. - Yeah, it was horrible. Well, see, I don't see the slab. It should have been right arou--about here. - Right here. - Yeah. - Right in here. - Our road manager, Dean Kilpatrick, he knew of a cabin on the creek that was for rent, and he said we could rehearse there. We asked permission to rehearse, so that started the whole thing right here. Hey, we wrote "Free Bird' here, you know, and all the so-called hits. People used to come up in boats and come in and steal mikes or--not big things but little things. And then one day we came in, and a window was knocked out, and there was a whole amp gone, so we started staying out here with guns to protect our equipment every night, and whoever had to stay, you know, it was, like, their day in the barrel or something. It was terrible 'cause the mosquitoes would bite you all night. Roaches were everywhere, and gators, and there was rattlesnakes, water moccasins, anything you could find, you know? We didn't have any money or food or drinks or nothing, so it was hell, and we called it the Hell House. ♪ ♪ I bet you still catch fish down here easy. - Oh, hell, yeah, you can. You can have a little-- - Well, something just turned right there. ♪ ♪ - Barry walks in and plays me this tape, and I listened to it--you know, just a little bit of it, and I just immediately, the second I got the opportunity, I said, "I want to work with this band." ♪ ♪ This band was so extraordinary. We taught them how to count off the song, you know, so they--"Count off the song." They said, "What?" They didn't know--have a clue on how to do that, but they were so good and so disciplined and so rehearsed that I've never seen the likes of them since. - We'd go back and forth all year, record, like, two songs and leave and come back a few months later. We'd have to go tour to get the money up, you know? 'Cause we were paying for it. Everything was new to us. I mean, we'd never been out of Jacksonville ever, you know, never. Maybe to go camping out in the woods somewhere, but that wasn't out of town. - We took our tapes, and we shopped it every way we could, ev--to every record company. Believe it or not, Lynyrd Skynyrd was turned down, and this is after hearing "Free Bird," now, turned down by nine major record companies, flat. They were like, "No. We don't want them, period." - So we were traveling around, riding on amps, having no money, having empty bellies, just trying to make it, man. It was just hard times. - Everybody was young and stupid back then. I was struggling. I didn't have a job. I was hurting, so I packed up and left. - Leon was in a band called the King James Version. It was a Christian band, but they weren't really doing Christian songs. - The first time I saw them, they were just real, you know, sort of a born losers type image, you know, the underdogs. ♪ ♪ - Well, Leon could just play any bass part; you'd never have to show him anything. Any song you could start playing he'd play, and he was funny and goofy, and he was just a great addition. - Noted musician and producer Al Kooper remembers the night he first discovered Lynyrd Skynyrd playing in a sweaty bar, what else, in Atlanta. - The thing that caught me first was Ronnie. I hated him, and I liked him at the same time. I said, "This guy is weird, you know?" He got me into it first before anything else. I just couldn't take my eyes off him. He was a very weird front man. - We loved Al Kooper's music, and he had just played with Hendrix on "Electric Ladyland." He did all the organ, you know, and would sit and tell us all the stories about how they recorded and what Jimi Hendrix did, and he had one of his black Strats. We'd just sit there and hold it, me and Allen, and just say, "Wow." It was mind - I made a deal with MCA records, a label deal, and I called my label Sounds of the South, and I signed Skynyrd, and we set to work. ♪ ♪ - That right there is an example of the people--you know, The Beatles. They're--they are the first people that really changed my style of music from a technical knowhow to a little bit of feel and a little bit of boogie-woogie. - Billy Powell, our piano player, he used to be our roadie, and we didn't know he play--he'd said, "Oh, I play piano," but we didn't care, you know? We were guitars. He liked Yes and Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, and we didn't at the time, but one night Billy said, "If I ever played 'Free Bird,' this is how I'd play it," and we weren't even paying attention, and he started out with his--everybody in the room kind of went, and he played it all, and we were just going, "Oh, my God, Billy. We didn't know you were that good," so we fired him as roadie and hired him as keyboard. - I was playing a nightclub in Greenville, North Carolina, with just a bar band. We didn't do any originals, but we really did some great cover tunes. Well, one night out of the blue I got a call from Ronnie at the bar. He said, "Look, you said you wanted to join up. You know, can you come down?" I said, "No, I don't have a car. Can you come up and get me?" He said, "I'll be right up." So yeah, they came up and picked me up, and I think we started rehearsal the next day. It was a real pleasant setting out in the middle of a pasture, but my either induction or punishment for joining the band was to spend a whole week out there at night by myself. I mean, for me growing up in L.A. and you say touring with the Beach Boys and some of the people I had access to is a completely different environment. I wasn't sure if I was gonna--going to survive in this environment, but I was willing to give it a shot, and everything was real strange to me. What can I say? I just felt so out of place. I think I felt out of place the whole time, but that first day I really felt out of place. ♪ ♪ - You know, there was all those cows at the Hell House, so every morning we would go out and get psilocybin mushrooms from all the cow patties and make tea, so we had a big pot of tea on the stove all day, mushroom tea, and if you'd take a few sips, and you'd be tripping, you know? The keyboard would be floating, or I watched the notes coming out of my amp. We would just talk and feel each other's stuff come out, you know? - Well, when I joined the band, the music is the thing that really threw me more than the people.

Everybody shows up, puts on a guitar, and Ronnie'd go, "Well, you have any ideas? Anything come to you last night?" The chances were real good that one of us had something on any day. That was the one advantage to having three guitar players. We'd just keep playing till we found something he liked. Once he'd write a lyric, well, there you go. Our work's cut out for us for the day. - Each line of each song we knew, and we'd break them down at the Hell House, and me and Leon would just play it, then me and Bob, then Leon and Bob, then me and Allen. We'd play all day the same song over and over and over and over. - I mean, what musicians do you know would get up at 7:30 in the morning and be out there by 8:30? Nobody, but we would, you know, and that was the thing that Ronnie was able to pull together, was guys that just really wanted to work. It was really productive. It was the most fun part about being in that band, was going out there in the heat in Hell House and writing these tunes, 'cause you never knew what you were gonna write. I mean, for the musician that just loves to play it was a dream job, even with the heat and everything, sweating all over your guitar. It was perfect. Hell House was the reward, really, yeah. - Patrol's at the crash site now trying to determine why a plane carrying the Lynyrd Skynyrd entourage crashed near McComb last night. At 7:47 Eastern Daylight Time, the aircraft disappeared from the radar scope, and they lost radio contact. The FAA's Jack Barker says the thick woods made the crash site difficult to both find and get to. - If you dig around right here right now in this general area, you're gonna find something, I promise you, just scrap pieces that have been here, and it's aluminum. It won't rust, so it's lasted forever, you know? Holy smokes, look at there. Look what I found, boys. Mm, here we go. Now--good lord. That's a piece of the plane. Look at that. That's it. - Yeah, that's it. - It's got the rivet hole. It's gotten a little corroded. Man, look at that. - Somebody, we don't know who, put a marker here for--just last--on the 20th, I understand. It just happens to be that is the spot where the plane--the nose of the plane hit right there. Most people don't know where the plane crashed. - Right. - Very few can tell you. They just come this way and start asking. We're 40 years past it now, and I was 11 years old and three hours north of here, but I knew what had happened, you know? Well, I just always wanted to find the story, the plane, the site, the whatever, and the next thing I know I've talked to 20, 30 people and gotten all their stories that were here that night. - You just don't forget it. I mean, it's something, you know, tragic that's gonna be in your mind always. See, by the time they got to the--right in here, this point, they didn't have any wings anymore. - They broke them off back there. - It was just fuselage, and that was it. Big split came down like a-- and went across this way, and when I pulled it up like that, you know, just a big space, and then somebody on the ground gave me a big, long stick to prop it up. I shined my flashlight up in there, and my first thought's, you know, "What's a bunch of hippies doing on an airplane?" 'cause back in those days hippies usually didn't have any money. You know, they were broke. But the playing cards was just--covered everything, you know? And people were moaning, you know, "Get me out of here," and, you know, we was just farm boys. We didn't know what we were doing, really, but we just got them out. I mean, it's just that simple. - Dwayne's sister, one thing she told me, that all up in the trees-- she said, "From their suitcases busting open and all that stuff, there were socks." She said, "Just socks went everywhere," you know? It was like Christmas, like tinsel. - The boys walked up to me and told me, they said, you know, "You know who this is?" I said, "No, hmm-mm." He said, "It's the Lynyrd Skynyrd band." I thought he was lying. They did a pretty dang good job. It's the best thing you can ever say for just a group of come-together farmers and loggers and ranchers and stuff like that and then a little volunteer fire department. They saved 20 lives. Let's give them full credit for that. You know, the band wouldn't have still be going on today had they not done what they did.

He's listening down there 'cause the music traveled down the creek really well, and he comes back, I guess, in about an hour and a half and grabs a mike, and he sings all the verses. He always wrote in his head, he never wrote anything down, so we were able to kind of arrange it. - The week that first album was being pressed Ronnie called me up, and he said, "We have a new song.

We had to have a drink before we could go out and play. We was so nervous. They only gave us some nights 20 minutes and others 30.

Less than a year later, in '73, "Pronounced" came out, and they were off and running. It really wasn't meant for me to be there then. It was meant for me to be here now. I was raised by a great musician, my grandfather, Shorty Medlocke. He pretty well much was a delta blues bluegrass player and a solid foundation in music around this town anyway. Ronnie would come over here and sit on the porch watching my old man play his Dobro. My old man would sometimes be out here at 2:00 a.m. in the morning playing.

What is that, some of no--northeast Georgia mountain water, is all that is. - I've listened to Skynyrd ever since they actually started, pretty much. - This is where I really got broke in on Skynyrd, I'd say. He had a old tape that he used to put in there. - An old cassette tape was one. - And it stayed on, I mean, nonstop. - I gave that--that cassette to Brantley. I said, "Here, you need to learn these songs," and it wasn't two days he was back over here. He had, like, two or three of them nailed. Like, "Damn, I hear ya, brother." - I have a line in one of my songs that says, "There's always some drunk guy in the back screaming out 'Free Bird!'" Every show you play, somebody wants you to play "Free Bird," but I always felt like that was a song you ought not touch. - Yeah. - You know, I fell in love with guitars, with big sound, and you know what the songs were about, you know?

I love this picture of Ronnie. He's got his Shoco shirt on, and there he is kind of looking down from heaven, saying, "Keep it real, Artimus," and--and just this little space here is, if nothing else, it's real. I was living in Spartanburg, South Carolina. We called it Sparkle City, and Bob was having some medical problems. So Ronnie calls me up, and he goes, "I just want to know if you can play. Everybody says you can." - Artimus was badass. He was a tough ex-marine, you know? He was the only one that could actually throw Ronnie around a little bit, but he was different than us too. He was from the Carolinas. He was a vegetarian. That was way different than us. We were barbecue boys, you know?

Usually on the road I live on yogurt and nuts, and the people that come up to me and say, "How do you do it?" It's just something that I do every day, and if you do something every day, you're bound to get good at it. - Artimus could play on the stuff he wrote with the band very well. It's one of those things, but he had trouble picking up Bob's feel, so that's when you had to go to Europe, and we had to take Bob to Europe, and things didn't go well. - Every damn country we went to, about the size of Georgia. Nobody spoke English. I was in France, ordered a ham sandwich. They brought me back a Marlboros. - Bob had a nervous breakdown about two weeks into the tour. - And we were at a hotel, he went nuts, so they all said, "Hey, go in there and talk to Bob." They were scared to go in. Even Ronnie was, you know, behind the curtain going, "You go in there," and I went in. He had--all the stuff was rearranged and changed and weird, and he was talking in this weird voice. - He was really kind of going through a devil possession type trip, and it was not fun. - I don't remember ever being fired from Lynyrd Skynyrd, and I never quit.

Does it get to you after a while? - We get a lot of publicity about busting up a place and being really mean or something like that, but you just get really tired.

Well, instead of doing that, we just liable to knock a hole in the wall or anything--any way to let--to let energy off, you know? It's also a tax write-off. - Nobody, no band or no human thing lived on this earth partied like Lynyrd Skynyrd partied, okay? Nobody did. - Let's just admit it. I mean, it was the '70s, and there was lots of cocaine, pills, alcohol. Promoters would always backstage provide cases of scotch and whiskey and beer and cartons of Winstons and Marlboros and, you know, a big food spread.

Leon thought that it would be a really good idea to take a number two in some guy's shoes that were outside of his door. I don't even know want to know how he did it. Anyway, this man starts to slip on his shoes. He's goose-stepping up and down the doggone hallway screaming at the top of his lungs, and now, of course, everybody in the hallway is looking out their doors, and so it's not obvious to this man which long-haired hippie nutcase did it. Of course, later, you know, Leon, "Heh-heh-heh. I did it." - I think the whole demolishing of the hotel room is so childish.

Okay, okay, I'm good." - There was one place in Waterbury, Connecticut, I'll never forget it, and we had our first bus. Somebody had left the brake off, and the bus had careened through the parking lot, over a sports car, through the gas station, and lodged into the bank, and I thought that was hilarious, and that was, I'm sure, on purpose. Okay, so I'm a hypocrite. So I thought some of the destruction was funny. - We went to England. They acted like we were the Beatles... - Thank you! - And we couldn't believe it. We were looking at each other like, "God, can you believe this?" They'd never heard of a Southern music or Southern bands. Over there, anybody from America's a Yankee. They call you Yankees, but we said, "No, we're from Southern America." "Yeah, you're a Yankee."

I didn't think about it that deeply then. I have since, and look what they've done. They've taken the flag down on a lot of things because it does represent hatred. - It's like the flag got kidnapped by the KKK. They carried it, and all these evil people use the Confederate flag as a hate thing. It's them against the world kind of.

I'm gonna sic a Okie on you. ♪ ♪ Well, this might sound egotistical, but I think right now I have a guitar player with me named Steve Gaines. - This man. - Who is probably the most underestimated guitar player on the south side of the Mason-Dixon line. - Steve had all these songs that he'd already written and he brought in, and then we would Skynyrd-ize it and make one of his songs ours. Me and Allen weren't offering probably as much as we could have at the time. We were so burnt, we kind of got uninspired. We knew something was missing, and Steve was it. It was like he found us, brought a spark back to everything. He made us get serious again, and we would rehearse more and work up guitar parts more. - Steve could grow excellent, like, tomatoes. I wouldn't call him a farm boy, but he could grow some bud. - When I get on the stage and a Skynyrd crowd are there, it just means everything to me. It's all I've wanted to do up till now. Now I'm trying to figure out what I can do from here, you know? - Well, we were doing great in Europe. Skynyrd was as big there as America, but we couldn't believe we were gonna open for the Stones. Nothing could be bigger. - It was the biggest show we ever did, you know? Just people everywhere. - And we were way early to make sure you could get to the stage through all the people, so we started drinking a little, and Cassie had a little pot, I think, but we looked up, and walking through the door is Jack Nicholson. "I smell something in here. Can" So it got crazy, and we were getting feisty and drunk, and we went out and had a great set. I don't know, when you're young and adrenaline hits you, you kind of shake off stuff. ♪ ♪ We started "Free Bird," and the whole crowd was really rocking. You could see they were all into it. ♪ ♪ When we started the end, Ronnie directed Allen to go out front, and Allen was kind of hesitant 'cause there was a rule not to go out on the tongue 'cause the tongue was the Stones--you know, that was gonna be their whole look, so Ronnie walked us all the way down just to defy that order. Allen went out all the way till his cord stopped, and Leon, he went till his cord jerked him back around, and Mick Jagger was mad. It took their breath away to see how well we went over and how we broke their only rule, don't go out on the tongue. ♪ ♪ - I tell you what, it's a dream. Everybody's still living the dream. It's still amazing to see how the people out there just go crazy, you know? ♪ ♪ - Nine years of hard work, rehearsing, recording, touring. That's what it took to become Lynyrd Skynyrd. Now their finest achievement, "Street Survivors." - ♪ What's your name, little girl ♪ ♪ What's your name? ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ - This is, like, the sixth album. I don't know what the "Rolling Stone" will say about it. I don't know what "Creem" will say about it. I know for a fact it's the best album we've ever done. I'll slap leather with anyone. - Where do you see Lynyrd Skynyrd going from here? - Well, we'll go to hell if we don't change our ways. ♪ ♪ - There was a saying back in the day, "There's the smell of death around him." It was like a smell around whatever was gonna die. ♪ ♪ - ♪ Whiskey bottles and brand-new cars ♪ ♪ Oak tree, you're in my way ♪ ♪ There's too much coke and too much smoke ♪ ♪ Look what's going on inside you ♪ ♪ Ooh, that smell ♪ ♪ Can't you smell that smell? ♪ - I'm just going to a club somewhere with a girl. I think her name was Sandy. I think we ate a Quaalude or something, so I was out of it, and we were going back home, and I kind of sped around a curve and lost control and hit a oak tree. I busted all my teeth out. I just came up with those lyrics about me stupid, drunk, and crazy. I made a bad mistake, but we got a good song out of it. - ♪ Now, they call you Prince Charming ♪ ♪ Can't speak a word when you're full of 'Ludes ♪ ♪ Say, you'll be all right come tomorrow ♪ ♪ But tomorrow might not be here for you ♪ - ♪ Yeah, you ♪ - Everybody was trying to clean up their act some, you know? It just got too wild, and Ronnie had decided he was gonna clean up his act because he and Judy had just had Melody, and, you know, he realized that he wasn't gonna live long if they didn't straighten it out. ♪ ♪ - ♪ Seems so long ♪ ♪ I been out on my own ♪ - ♪ Travel light ♪ and I'm always alone ♪ ♪ Guess I was born with a traveling bone ♪ ♪ When my time's up, I'll hold my own ♪ ♪ You won't find me in a old folks home ♪ ♪ You got that right ♪ - After all those years, 12 years Gary and I and Allen have been together, it finally paid off in just something that you believed in, that you could do it, you know? That fact that we proved it, you know, that really makes me happy, and you know, just everything seems to be going pretty good for me right now. I'm probably happier than I ever have been before. I mean, it could end tomorrow, you know? I mean, Lynyrd Skynyrd could be gone tomorrow. - The one thing that I want the world to know about my band is how bravely my band met their death. We spiraled in from 9,000 feet. Everyone knew it was gonna end badly. There was no panic, no chaos. Everybody was in prayer, in deep thought, and I admired that about them, that they met their death that way, and they did. - Things were going wrong with the plane a little bit, nothing serious but enough to notice it wasn't flying top We were about to get maintenance on it and put it in the shop because a engine was sputtering. It needed a tune-up, I guess. I wasn't really worried about it myself, but I'll only speak for me. I know before we took off and stuff, some of the girls and Allen and some of the guys didn't want to fly, and Ronnie was the one who said, "When it's our time to go, you can kiss my ass good-bye," you know? But he didn't know, and he said, "We got a plane here to take us to our hotel "and to do a show tonight. Get on, or get your own way there." I was with Ronnie saying, "Let's just do it, get it fixed tomorrow," but it never happened. Everybody was playing poker. I remember Ronnie did have a little hangover, so he just threw a pillow down and was laying on the floor, and all of a sudden you could really feel a little sputtering and spitting. - I was in the cockpit in the navigator jump seat in between the pilot and the copilot. I looked at Walter McCreary, and I said, "We can fly on one engine, right?" He looked at me with fear in his eyes, and I saw it. His eyes were bugging out. He said, "Artimus, you better go back and strap yourself in." - The pilot sent the copilot back to say, "Hey, we're gonna make a landing "and try to see what's happening here, "so it might be a little rough, so put your heads between your legs," like back in the Cold War when the schools said, "There's a nuclear bomb coming. Just get under your desk. You'll be fine." - Ronnie walked to the rear of the plane, and I thought to myself, "Good idea," and then he came up the aisle and stopped right by me. We shook the old hippie handshake. He smiled, and then Ronnie walked back to the front of the plane. I'll never forget the smile that he gave me, that beautiful Ronnie Van Zant smile. - We started hitting the treetops real-- you could hear them, and it got louder and louder and-- until it just got so overwhelming, loud, and bumping that that's when I, I guess, got knocked out. - It felt like a thousand baseball bats being beaten on the fuselage. So the plane started coming apart, and I'm looking out the window. The left wing comes off. - I woke up on the ground. I thought a plane door was on me 'cause I couldn't move and get up. In reality, I was so broken, all my bones and legs and everything, I just couldn't get up. And I said, "Dean, get this door off me. Dean, come here," and I swear to God, to me, he came over and pushed the door off me. Later on, one of the doctors said that he couldn't have done that, the way they brought him in. He was too far gone, you know? But I saw him do it. - My friends were bleeding to death. I knew that the only thing that was gonna help my friends was to get to a farmhouse and bring help back to that crash site, but we stopped so fast, my boots had come off, and I couldn't bend over because of my chest injuries, so I'm walking through the briars and the brambles, and it was getting darker and darker. - I remember waking up to the helicopters that were hovering, you know, and they were shining lights down into the swamp. It was like Vietnam in my head. I only seen it on TV, but the helicopters and your buddies screaming and yelling in pain and dying around you. - Last night in woods near McComb, Mississippi, a chartered airplane crashed, and with it went the rising hopes of a popular rock band, Lynyrd Skynyrd. Survivors said the plane was so rundown, they'd been considering not flying in it again. - The next thing I remember was waking up in the hospital, and both arms were broken and both legs, and this leg got cut off except for a little bit of skin, and they put it back on, and I had some ribs broken, my pelvic and all--everything, man. - The band was traveling from a concert in South Carolina to another one in Louisiana, part of a four-month tour that just started. As victims and survivors were brought to hospitals, no one could say for sure how many people were aboard the plane, but by dawn six passengers were known dead. 20 others, many of them technicians and friend of the band, were listed as injured, many critically. - It was--had to be the next day 'cause my mother had gotten there, and I asked her, "Did anyone die?" and she wouldn't tell me for--it seemed to me for a long time. I said, "Please tell me," and she started right off with Ronnie, and that really freaked me out 'cause he was the tough guy. I thought if he died, everybody else did. - Those dead are Lynyrd Skynyrd lead singer Ronnie Van Zant, guitarist Steve Gaines, and his sister Cassie, a backup vocalist, assistant road manager Dean Kilpatrick, the plane's pilot Walter McCreary, and copilot William Gray. - There was two benches in the front of the plane. Ronnie was here, and I was between him and Dean, and Allen was right across on that little bench in front of me, and he was between Cassie and Steve, so all those people died, and Allen and me didn't, and after it we freaked out a bit.

Pianist Billy Powell is in stable condition at Baptist. Guitarist Allen Collins is undergoing surgery at the University Medical Center now. Bass player Leon Wilkeson is in critical condition in Southwest Medical Center in McComb, and drummer Artimus Pyle is in good condition at a hospital in Magnolia. This is Randy Bell, ZZQ News. - A lot of flowers came in, and they set them all around the room. For days I remember the faces of Ronnie and everybody who died. I could see their faces like a shadow in those plants. I could look up at them. I even said, "Don't you see them up there, mama? Don't--" and it was just me, I guess. I think they were there helping, you know, in those flowers for about a week. Then they went away. The spirits went away. - Mama was the first one buried here, and then whenever they tried to break into Ronnie's grave and Steve, moved out-- - Just all out of here. - We brought him out here. This is where Daddy wanted him at in the beginning. - Yeah, I know. I must be over here. You're gonna be right there. - I'll be spitting range from you. - My wife and I just bought that right over there. - It's all marked out too. - Yeah, I know. - It's all marked out. Let's walk over there, or do you want-- - I don't really want to. I don't want to yet. Too sacred ground. - Hey, look, there's money on it, on top of his tombstone there. You know, people put things out here. - They come and have a drink, a lot of beer cans and . - Yeah. - It's an honor, really. - Yeah, it is. It is. They loved the music, and, "Hey, I'm gonna have a beer, what the hell?" I'm sure Ronnie don't mind. - No. - You know, he don't mind. You go, "Why did it have to happen?" But I always say I kept a lot of questions I have to ask, you know, when I go on. When I go on, so I hope I can get some answers. - I think if we're gonna get them, that's when. - Yeah, exactly. ♪ ♪ - ♪ If I leave here tomorrow ♪ ♪ Would you still remember me ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ For I must be traveling on now ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ 'Cause there's too many places I've got to see ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ And if I stayed here with you, girl ♪ ♪ Well, things just couldn't be the same ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now ♪ ♪ I swear I am♪ ♪ And the bird you'll never change ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ The bird you cannot change ♪ - In '87 we did a tribute tour, and then after that tour everybody, they wanted us to come to their town too, and so we said, "Yeah, let's do it again," and we kept catching on, and we kept touring. Being in a band, that's all we know. I can't do anything but play guitar and fish, and I couldn't do anything else. Now we got Ricky Medlocke playing his guitar. Johnny didn't think he could fill his brother's shoes. Of course, Ronnie never wore shoes. You ain't got to fill his shoes. You're not gonna. I used to say he was spanked by the same daddy and ate the same food just like Ronnie. It's 30 years later, and it's still going, and people come, and the younger generation learns. It's not about us. It's about the feelings of that music and the stories they tell.
