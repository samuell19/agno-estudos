Mommy! Don't worry, I'll look after the kids. Hide! Hurry! Take the kids with you. Hurry up! Take them to the beach. An American guy will meet you. An American? At the beach? Yes! Now go! I'll join you there, don't worry about a thing. Please. Go. Go! Hurry, now. WHITE FIRE Halt! I guess this must be their mother. Well, it was their mother. You can't stay here, kids. Let's go. I'm a friend of your dad's. You have to come with me. Don't be scared. He'll come and get you. Come on! Look after the little girl. We need to make sure they don't follow us. Come on, kids! Quickly, now. - What's your name, kid? - Mike. - Is that your sister? - Yes, her name's Ingrid. - I.D. please, Miss. - Here. You should recognize me by now. - Okay, that's fine. - Thanks. - I'm innocent! - Not from what we've seen. - Have mercy! - Never for thieves! Come on, leave me alone! Have mercy! Let me go! I'm innocent! I knew he had it on him. And what's this? Is this not a diamond? - You stole it, didn't you? - No! No! Sam? Is Mike there? I think so, I'll call him. Mike? - Mike? - Yeah, I'm coming. Relax! - Who is it? - It's Ingrid. Hi, little sister. What do you want? Hi, Mike. It's my birthday. Did you forget about my invitation? - I'll just get my things. I'll be there soon. - Okay. Hurry up. I'm on my way. It's happening today. A little stroll through the mountains. Tell me you have the picnic basket. A word of advice: take the coastal road. There aren't as many security patrols, they're more relaxed along the coastline. - Don't do anything stupid. - I know what I'm doing. And besides, she's my way in. Everyone around here trusts her. Plus, I wanna stay alive. Catch you later, Sam. See you tonight. - Have you finished? - Yeah. Have a good afternoon. Thanks. It's my birthday and my brother's spending it with me so that I don't get sad. He looks after you very well, your brother. Yeah, he looks out for me day and night so that nothing bad happens to me. Just like you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Ingrid, you forgot the most important thing. Oh, what was I thinking? Thanks. I truly wish I was taking your brother's place this afternoon. You know what? Getting these diamonds on my birthday puts me a bit on edge. Don't you worry, little sister. Diamonds are a big deal to the rich. They open many doors. Hey, we got company. Faster! We can't let them get too close. I think we lost them. Looks like we're okay, then. Hold it! - Shit, this is all we need. - Hurry up and get out! - Calm down. - I said quickly! Leave it to me. - Get out of the vehicle! - Do as they say. Easy. Cough up the diamonds. I don't think you want to lose your sister, Mr. Donnelly. Certainly not. - Maybe we can talk. - That's more like it. The diamonds. I'm waiting. - Calm down. - Sophia, they're here. Welcome aboard, Mr. Donnelly. You're a businessman, I presume? - I like making money, so I guess so. - We're your new clients. No, that's alright. We've got plenty already. If you love diamonds so much, why not steal them yourselves? Why would we risk it? You work at the mine, the big boss looks the other way and you give the go-ahead. You share the spoils with them. Nobody risks a thing. Why change that? - What if we don't want to do that? - Fair enough... Barbossa would love to look after your sister for a few days, which will give you ample time to consider our proposition, Mr. Donnelly. That's that, then. Partners. Partners? Stealing from a partner. That's no good, is it? This diamond belongs to us. The same thing happens if he touches my sister. Can I have a cigarette? - Pretty hard-headed, little sister? - I'm fine. Hurry up and untie me. - Well, his boss will be happy about that. - She must be up on the bridge. - She has the diamonds? - Less talk, more action. Let's get on with it, then. - No kiss goodbye for him? - Hell no! We'll be casting off in 30 minutes. Everyone, to your stations! - I thought you were a gentleman. - I am, but she's not my type. Come on. Can you get us out of here? We'll pay you handsomely. - Yeah. - Okay. Smart guy! Go! Get moving! Aren't you worried about sunburn? Go! Quickly, now! They've disappeared. Well, I was at the rendezvous with Apaydin. He told me he's coming back tomorrow, and he wants the money or the diamonds. - I know Mike, he wouldn't do that to me. - Well, let's hope so. I really don't think he'll be at a nightclub. Maybe he's just had a few too many. - Hi! - So, Sam, did we scare you? - You did. What happened? - We took a little boat ride. Come on, stop fooling around. Okay, we ran into some small problems. We have some competition, Sam. They were waiting for us in the mountains. - Who's "they"? - I don't know. Some Italian woman called Sophia. She was the boss, I think. And some gang leader called Barbossa. What do they want? They wanted to be our partners, Sam. They wanted half the cut from our business. We politely declined. And here are the goods. I don't want to be complacent with these. You know what? Me neither. But we have to trust each other. They know everything. They must have someone on the inside. And if we don't find out who it is, and quickly, our necks will be on the line. We have a leak in the organization. They knew the exact time and day of each drop. They knew about Yilmaz. Impossible. What do you suggest? Pose as partners... ...and we'll see where he's fled to. It's up to you, Sam. But if there's any trouble, I can't help you. What a surprise! Always a pleasure, Mr. Apaydin. - Please. - Wise guy. Well, Sam, you best fill them in on our conversation. Good night. What a creep. I think so, too. You got some strange friends, Sam. The White Fire! - Yes, what is it? - There's a man here to see you. - What man? - He won't give his name. He seems agitated. - What does he look like? - He's a miner. A miner? We employ thousands of miners. Yes, but there's some thing strange about this guy. He keeps saying that he was hurt by a gem that he found. Tell him I'll be there in a few minutes. White Fire! The White Fire! I found it. The White Fire. - The White Fire? - Yes. Aldo! Go and tell Ingrid to meet me in my car. - It's here! - But this gallery has been shut for years. The White Fire, it's here! The most beautiful diamond in the world. So it's not just a legend. It's beautiful! The White Fire! Look at it! It's mine now! Why? Do you really want to see it put up for auction? I, too, would give my life for the White Fire. It's ours... the most beautiful stone seen this century. - Yes? - It's me. We need to meet and talk. I'm busy on the boat, why can't you tell me now? - I can't. - But you can! I don't want to. I'll meet you at the usual place, okay? Alright. I'll meet you in an hour, okay? Hurry up. You're joking, right? The White Fire doesn't exist, it's a legend. It's ridiculous. I told you, I saw it. Okay, okay, you saw it. What's it got to do with us? Think about it. If we can get it, we'll be free. Not to mention rich beyond belief. No more slavery, no more Apaydin, no more Yilmaz. And we can finally leave this place. We could end up with life in prison. You want to know what I think? It's too dangerous. Are you frightened? Listen... It's been 20 years since our parents gave their lives for ours. We only have each other now. I don't want to lose you. Nor do I want to end up in prison. Let's at least talk to Sam and see what he says. Okay? Alright, then. Mr. Yilmaz, to what do we owe the pleasure? Let's be partners. - Did you say "partners"? - Shut up. Go on. Since we are partners, I thought I'd tell you a secret. - Do you know what the White Fire is? - The White Fire? The White Fire, yeah. I have it in my possession, and I estimate it at 2,000 carats. A diamond? Who else knows about it, apart from me? A young American woman. My secretary. - A young American woman? - She's called Ingrid. I believe our paths have already crossed. Where? When? Why? It doesn't matter. She and I are the only ones who know where it is. I wanted you to know about it. - I hate it when you do that! - So, what's for dinner? You'll find out once it's on your plate. It's good, but it just needs a pinch of salt. That's exactly what it doesn't need. Why don't you make yourself useful and go get your sister? Whatever you say, Sam. You know what's funny? It really does need salt. Oh, Mike, stop it! - You scared me! - Dinner's ready. Sam's setting the table. - I'll be there in a second. - What are you doing? Swimming naked? I'm doing no harm, and I have nothing to hide. - We'll see about that. - Please give it back! We're brother and sister, we have nothing to hide from each other. Stop it! - Give me back my towel. - No. This is stupid! It's not funny. And don't look at me like that. It's a shame you're my sister. Sorry about that. Dinner's in ten minutes. Okay. One last swim, then I'll be there. About time. She'll be here soon. Let's try this salad. Do you want some wine? What's up with Dusty? Who's there? Mike, this isn't funny! It's pretty good, but a bit bland. We'll fix that up right away, eh, Sam? Look, you're not putting ketchup on it. It's stuffed with plenty of herbs and olives. And you want to add this condiment that's full of... Fine, Sam. I won't put it on, but it is bland. - Don't kill her, Sophia wants her alive! - Alive and well. Imbecile. Did I not say that I wanted her alive? What's that? Dusty, probably. - Let him back in. - Okay. Women don't understand the concept of time. I know. If you don't want the evening to be ruined, tell her to get her butt in here! Dusty, where are you? You go that way. Josephine! No! I know it's difficult to say what we feel, but when you've seen as many bodies as I have... Sam, no. None of that "life goes on" shit. Please. - I need to speak with you. - No. No, Sam, I don't want to hear it. What reason have I got to keep on living, Sam? Please, leave me alone. I can't, just as I couldn't leave the two of you on the beach all those years ago. No, please. - I'm sure that Ingrid... - Shut up, Sam! Just shut up! Never speak her name again, Sam. Never again, I'm begging you. Never again. Why, Sam. Why? I'll keep the bottle, thanks. I think you've had enough. Leave me alone. We could spend the night at mine. I said, leave me the hell alone. - I'm sorry. - It's fine. So, shall we get out of here? You've got a broken heart. Nothing gets past you. I wouldn't say no. Get lost. - That's enough. - Hey, she told you "no"! This is going to end badly. Come with me. No! I'm gonna kill him. Well, go on, then. - Is he hurt? - No, just drunk. His address was in his wallet, so I brought him here. - Does that surprise you? - Huh? No, sorry. What is it? What's the matter? Nothing, but... Look, we were in a bar together, he drank a bit too much and got in a fight. So I brought him here, alright? I'll leave you to it. I think a cup of coffee would do him some good. Okay. The girl that brought you here. Without her, I don't think I'd be here. Have you really looked at her? Yeah, she's a pretty girl. Do you know who she reminds me of? You're kidding. She's the spitting image of Ingrid. That's not by chance. You could've sworn it was her. - Where are you going with this? - She could take Ingrid's place. Nobody would suspect a thing. And if she takes Ingrid's place, we could carry on as normal. We could keep trying to find a way out. I think you're talking utter nonsense. Would you be interested in making $50,000? Well, yeah. Do you know anyone who'd turn down $50,000? What would I have to do? Well? I'm all ears, gentlemen. Try harder, Olga. I told you, Ingrid spoke Russian fluently. You need to know at least a few words. A... za... drovo... vas. No... Just make a bit of an effort, you really need to concentrate... I don't give a shit! I've had enough of your sister's traits! I know she speaks Russian, I'm just trying my best here! I'm up to here with "Ingrid this" and "Ingrid that." Screw your Ingrid! Don't you ever insult my sister again. You're getting very well paid for this. If you want your cash, try harder. And you will not insult my sister. I will not accept it. Mike. Oh, Mike. I don't know what came over me, I'll do whatever I can. I'll try and do what you're asking of me, but I'm not your sister. And if I can't do what she would do... it's not my fault. I assure you. It's difficult for a woman to change her personality, so I'm asking you to be patient. Okay. I'll be patient. No, that's not it. Try again. Keep going, keep going... Reverse now. A bit more... there we go! That's it! You did it! I love you, Mike! Is that your first name, "Olga?" Just as your first name is "Sam". But now, my name is Ingrid. So, Sam, tell me about this trip. - Trip? - Yeah. A little vacation. You'll be away for three weeks. I'll be away? Are you joining me, Mike? No, I have some things to take care of. It's only three weeks. But something might happen! It's not like I'm just having a tooth out. They're going to change my whole face, right? What if they screw it up? - She can't screw it up... - "She"? - She's an expert. - But she's a woman! She's more competent than any man. When it comes to plastic surgery, she's the best. You have nothing to worry about. I need the money... but it's a high price to pay. She'll do it. I hope so. But I wonder if I have the right to ask her to do it. It seems you have some information for me. Screw you! I hate resorting to violence, but we've gone to a lot of trouble to find you. Please... try to remember. Olga... she's living with another guy. Who is he? I don't know anything. No! Well, let's try and jog your memory. I'm in a hurry. - Who is he? - No. Try harder. I'm a reasonable man, but don't push it. In addition, don't make me wait, or you'll never be able to speak again. Okay, okay. I'll tell you. She's living with a man. - And what's his name? - Mike Donnelly. He lives... with an American. So, if we find Mike Donnelly... we find our beloved Olga. Thank you. A small gift. Welcome, young lady. Come. We'll look after you. This is the operating theater, from which you will emerge with a new face. All these young girls here are at your beck and call. Their perfect features showcase what we do best here. The disappearance of your secretary doesn't concern you? Not in the least. She went on holiday with her brother, which they do often. Anything else? The miner's death doesn't seem suspicious to you... Doctor? His hands were severely burned, as though he'd been exposed to an extremely high dose of radiation. Yet, there is currently no trace of uranium anywhere in the mines. It is said, however, that there was a diamond so brilliant that anyone who got close to it was horribly burned. I know all this sounds like folklore, but perhaps what is being referred to here is the "White Fire"? A diamond that is one of a kind. A diamond that was forged thousands of years ago, in the lava of an active volcano. It burned with a bright white flame, and had potentially fatal powers. Well, gentlemen, let's get to work. If we find the girl, we find the guy. You know where we need to go first. Stay close. - Noah, everything's perfectly in order. - It's just a routine check. You two, search upstairs. What's the meaning of this circus? We're looking for someone. Well, you're looking in the wrong place. Let's see, shall we? Hey, come on! Grab a piece. Let's see what you're made of. Get out of here! Noah, she isn't here. My deepest apologies, Madam. But in your line of work, undesirables are never too far away. We just wanted to make sure you weren't in danger. Let your boss know that we'll cover the damages. Tell him yourself. A debt paid is a friend kept. - You can't stay here. - Well, we were just leaving. Go on, then. Hurry up. I'm sorry, Madam. Where are my manners? Get out. Get out! Next time, better keep quiet. What was Apaydin doing with Yilmaz? I don't know anything. - I want to know. - I don't know anything! Barbossa! I can assure you, I don't know anything. I don't know anything. No, Barbossa! I don't know anything! No, let me go! I told you, I don't know anything! I swear to you, I couldn't hear what they were saying! I couldn't hear anything! - That's not true! - I tried but I couldn't hear them! Seriously? - What do you take me for? An idiot? - I swear! They bought your silence, I'm sure! I couldn't hear anything, I swear! What were they talking about? - No! - Tell me. - They were talking about the White Fire. - I don't know! And what did they say about the White Fire? What did they say about the White Fire? I don't know, I swear! Where's he hiding it? Please, I beg you! No! - Olga? - Oh, thanks. I never thought three weeks could last so long. Perhaps, but you're going to be so happy with your new face. We've got to move quickly. How many men do you need? About twenty. - Not a problem. - Do you trust the crew? Like I trust myself. What about Apaydin? We don't need to worry about him. And how will you go about moving it? We have the appropriate equipment and materials at the mine. - Appropriate materials? - Yes. To protect ourselves from the radiation that the White Fire emits. Moving a stone like that is no mean feat. Don't you think it would be better to move it under cover of darkness? No. I've made all the necessary arrangements. And I'm the one calling the shots. Night or day, it's up to you. Getting the White Fire on board is the only thing that matters. Mike! Hey, Mike! So? I must be dreaming... It's amazing. But tell me, do you really want to take this risk? I did all of this for you. For me? Because I love you, Mike. No, we can't do this. I can't risk losing you like I lost... Like you lost Ingrid? Go on, say it. I'm Ingrid now. Did I do all that for nothing? I remember all the things you said to me, Mike. Do whatever it takes to get out of this country. Never having to lie, or hide anything ever again. Having hope for the future. Or you can wallow in your sense of loss. Olga... Ingrid. I love you. Enjoy your carousel ride? So you won't talk? Where is Olga? With Sam and Mike. They left by boat. So, what do you think? Can I pass as Ingrid? Well, vacation's over, then. Now we move on to more serious matters. First of all, we need to make sure all our friends know that Ingrid is back. - Maybe we could throw a party. - Yeah! Yilmaz needs to know his secretary is coming back to work. The face is perfect, but I'm not so sure about the voice. For me, her voice is pretty much the same. For you, maybe. Your hearing never was very good. It's dangerous. Ingrid? I'm sorry. Sam, you're right. Let's get moving. Don't worry, leave it to me. Are you still thinking about throwing this party? I don't think it's a good idea to invite Yilmaz. You don't trust me, either? I have every faith in you. But look, Ingrid, this could... What did you say? Look, if I've convinced you, what's the problem? I can handle Yilmaz, he doesn't scare me. And anyway, if we want the White Fire, we don't have a choice. Yilmaz, thank you for giving me time off. A bit too much time, maybe. You'll have to make up some hours. My sister will do just that, Yilmaz. I feel we've met before, surely. Of course, I'd forgotten. We had quite the party, didn't we? You always look so elegant. Is that an Italian dress? Nothing gets past you. Mike, I think we should go and welcome our other guests. Please excuse us. Please, can I offer you a drink to celebrate the occasion? - With pleasure. - A martini, perhaps? Why didn't you call? I was waiting for them to let me know. They want it in a week. That's not long enough. We need two. I have to change the guard duty and it needs to happen at night. I'll talk to my brother. There's no point. I'm the one running this thing, I'm the one who decides the pick-up... ...for the White Fire. We can't make the slightest mistake, and we can't be too careful. That's why you have to stay with me day and night. And Apaydin? Oh, I forgot to tell you, he's out on a mining inspection, he'll be gone for at least a month. We don't have anything to worry about with him. Her voice is a little different, but it's definitely her. You're right. It really is her, I'm sure of it. - Oh, no. - What is it? Noah Barclay. We've got history. I can't talk to him, he'll recognize me. - I better get out of here. - You're crazy! You're Ingrid, not Olga anymore. Come. Come with me. Ah, Noah! The famed policeman. - I don't believe we've had the pleasure. - You must be joking! Well, okay, I'll introduce myself. Mike. Mike Donnelly. Mike Donnelly? Yeah, that's it. Mike Donnelly. Sorry, let me introduce you to my sister, Ingrid. Noah... How have you managed to hide something so enchanting, Mike? The main reason I came to this party is because we have lots to discuss. - Really? - Yes. Lots to talk about. But I don't really think this is a good place for us to talk. Okay, well, give me a moment to think about it. We must always obey the police, Mr. Donnelly. Please excuse me. Oh, you should know that I don't like foreigners, nor do I like over familiarity. That said, your sister is so charming, I will make an exception. Because we've already met. We were introduced at a function down at the mine last month. Nice to meet you. We're in trouble. So, Doctor... do you remember if this girl was on your operating table? This photo will refresh your memory. You wouldn't want something bad to happen to the doctor because of you, right? Where is she? No. She won't tell you anything. Your loyalty will cost you. You'll be raped in front of your friends. No! Don't do that. - So, Doctor... - You disgust me. Just because you're the police, you think you can do whatever you want. - I hate you. - I know, I know. Women like you don't deserve my chivalry. Now, tell me where she is right now. She left three days ago. With Sam, the American guy. He came to get her. Olga is his sister. I don't understand. You... You changed her face? And I fell for it. He'll be here soon, so be ready. Ingrid or Olga, it doesn't matter to him. This could go really badly. But we're going to give him a very warm welcome. You can't stay here. Back to the house. Marc, Robert, take the door. Hey, Mike... Can we talk? No weapons. I only want what belongs to me. Maybe I need to show you her photo? That's my sister you're talking about. My ex-girlfriend, you mean. He knows. Ingrid, you're better off going to Yilmaz and getting him to hurry the plan along. The earlier the better. Okay. Good luck. - Shoeshine, sir? - Make sure they're glowing. And mind the socks. - So what's the plan? - We're on for tomorrow. Mike and Ingrid will bring you the White Fire. Tomorrow? I think it would be better if we went with them. No, I have a better idea. We'll surround the American's house. Fine. - Right, all done? Let's go. - Yep. Here you are. - No. - Is that right? Yeah, that's right. Thanks. Main gate reporting: unknown persons are entering the mine. But, it's... Barbossa? Can you put Sophia on? Sophia? Mike, the American, and their men just came through the front gate. What? Yeah. Hurry up. We can't let them get their hands on the White Fire. Get in position. Hurry. You, take this. - I brought something extra. - It'll come in handy. I'll meet you inside. I'm gonna blow! Right, ready? Let's go. Quickly, now! Here are your uniforms. Officers wear red, guards wear blue. From what Ingrid told me, this should be it. It's so bright. - This is it. - It's beautiful. The biggest and most beautiful diamond in the world. Watch out for the radiation. No, don't! It's dangerous. You'd burn yourself. Be careful, Mike. What's this? Diamonds, and lots of them. I don't believe it. We'll never be able to move it. We need a thermal lance or a mechanical grab. I think I know where to find what we need. The problem is getting it here. It just might work, though. You two, with me. Be quick. Yilmaz! Yilmaz betrayed us! Into the mine! Quickly! Hey, Donnelly! First you, then your sister. Get down! - We're done for, Sam. - No. There's an opening up there. - We can try and climb out. - We might be able to, but you can't. We don't have time for a discussion! Go, quickly! Get the hell out of here, Mike! - Don't worry about me. - No, Sam. - You need to get out of here! - If you're staying, then so are we. Don't make me beg you! Please, go! Just a bit further, Sam. - Come on! - Come on, Sam! We're nearly there. That's it. We made it. We're free. Don't speak so soon. Hi, Olga. I've come for you. Fine, Noah. I'll go with you, but leave Mike alone. "Leave Mike alone." Sacrificing herself for the man she loves. And how will you explain to your boss that you're bringing him my sister? Oh, you have something in mind? You could tell him that Olga was killed in the mine. And I could offer you these in exchange. And to think, I always thought you were unpleasant. But I must admit, you have touched me deeply. It would probably be best if you both disappeared. The quicker the better, I'd say. I won't tell you twice. Mike... Treat her right. - Come on, Sam. - No. - We'll take you home. - No, it's alright. I know the way.
