Djuro! Oh, Djurica boy. A cup of coffee? -No, thanks. Djuro, my boy... Life's not a bed of roses. Times don't look rosy, and my finances don't either. I really don't know what to do. I've been calculating. I've been adding up the money we make and you guys. But it doesn't work out. It's like I had three pieces of bread and four mouth to feed. You don't get a piece each. So, I had to make a decision. I know it's not easy to get a job nowadays. Nobody has to tell me that. But, I had to make a choice. My philosophy is that, well, Stankovic has two kids. So, um... well, he's got to stay. Podbregar has just got married. Puksic is building the house. He spends it all on bricks and to pay off the loan. But you're young. You don't have a family yet, not even a girlfriend. You don't have an anchor to keep you here. A young man is like a cat. A cat always lands on its paws. You'll work your way out. This is what I was trying to work out. Well.. do you get it? I mean, to hell with it. You can think about me whatever you like. I was never stingy. I didn't wanna fuck you up. I got you a contact from a friend of mine. A truly good man, and a great expert. You can learn a lot from him if you want. But, that's up to you. This is how it is. What I was saying... Are you sure you don't want coffee? This machine makes really delicious coffee. ROOSTER'S BREAKFAST Car Repair Gaja Good dog, good dog... To hell with the bitch. She never barks at strangers. You stupid dog. She barks at her master and wags her tail at strangers. Go to your doghouse! I'm Djuro. I called the other day. -I'm Gaja. Radmilovic sent me here. Want some? -Oh, thanks. You're from Maribor, right? -Yes. Sit down. Tell me, how's TAM doing? What are you staring at? TAM, the car factory. It is still working or has it gone to hell? It's decaying. Of course it's decaying! Politicians don't give a damn. They don't give a damn about anything that was good in ex-Yugoslavia. You weren't born yet when I was repairing cars in that car factory. Everywhere in ex-Yugoslavia people knew me. All the way down to Kragujevac. Those were the days when Tito was still alive. When Tito was around, God was with us. Look at our politicians today! They're a bunch of cowards. Tito was a real man. He quieten the Russians, and tricked the Americans. He said "nijet" to Stalin, and got us money from the Yankees. I don't remember Tito. I know. That's why you think this is none of your business! But, it is! If Tito was alive, you wouldn't have to look for work. In Yugoslavia they'd roll out the red carpet for you. Workers were applauded at. I remember coming to Sarajevo once. They all awaited me. Directors, engineers... A brass band played on my arrival. A brass band? -Brass, yes. Don't you know what a brass band is? -Brass instruments... And they roasted an ox. Not one, hundreds of them. Not hundreds really, but ten for sure. Then the girls came and we drank and we sang till the dawn. -Listen... You said you've got work for me. I just wanna know I didn't come here in vain. Listen, kid. If you wanna work for me, you'll have to learn when you open your mouth and when you keep it shut. Remember this: If you fight for politics, you'll fight in vain. But if you fight for food or for a girl, then I'll be the first to start the fight. I could make you an expert. An expert! It wasn't your choice to come here in this godforsaken place. It was the idea of those who sacked you. Are you gonna sit here without a word or you gonna stay? You gonna take me? -I'll take you. Look at the dog, she's smelling you. What do you want, um? You'll feed her when I forget where my home is. And you'll answer the phone. Look at her: "Gib mir ein kuss". I think she understands German. I've got to give her a treat. What needs to be done here? -The belt. Right, the belt. What was the last time you were here? You've got to come here every year, man. What about the exhaust? -Uf, it's cracking, too... To hell with it! Holy cow... I've got two. Has anyone got more? Put the cards away. Who dealt the cards? I'm gonna play if nobody else is. What did I get? Oh, nice! I'll take that. Look at him. He goes to bed at dusk and gets up the last. Morning. -This is my friend, Zobar. He's the best dentist around. Hi. -I'm Djuro. How is it? -Djuro. No, I mean how is it going? How are you? Gaja says you're from Maribor. -Yeah. Whereabouts? -Studenci, near the sports hall. I went to high school there. I lived there five years. I got my first job on Kopitarjeva Street. Railway Health Centre. -At the post office. Yes, at the train station. Those were grat times. We were young and handsome. Oh, and we fucked a lot. It was different than today. The girls were chasing us. Now we have to chase them. Right, Gaja? -Yeah, it was like that. Take some, kid. It's all homemade. Hello, Malacic! Are you working? -Working, working... Wanna come in for a drink? I can't right now. Later. -Alright. Good afternoon. Where have you been, my dear, pretty Ana? What's up, Gaja? Djuro, this is our Ana. -Ana, my new apprentice. Hello. -You found a handsome guy. Beware of the witty fox. She'll hug you with one hand and stick the other right into your pockets! -Beware of Gaja, boy. If you do as he does, you'll have your throat wet and you wallet always empty. We know this is true, right Gaja? Oh, Ana. Pour us drinks. It's boiling hot outside. What will you have, guys? A spritzer for me. -A beer. In twenty-nine days you'll get your first paycheck. Here you go guys... -Thanks, Ana. Now that you're mine, kid, you've got a guarantee in all sacred places. You still owe me for the last month. Shut up, you wicked witch! You steal money from us, the poor. Listen to me, kid. Treat a woman like a wolf treats a fox. Grab her by her throat and let her go. Grab her by her throat again and let her go. I had all sorts of chicks coming up to me. Beware of chicks who'd rather get laid than pay for repair. They'll always come up with something broken. But they can't pay one hour of your work. Some chicks would get laid for a winshield. Even if you charge them, they'd come back and catch you in their trap. And you're done. Yeah, well, to hell... Only once, I went through this and it'll never happen again. It's over. It's better to be single. -No! Listen to me, kid. The best chicks are those who cause crashes. A crash fuels a woman like a lightning strike. The chicks who cause crashes are really something special. This is how it is for sure. They don't give a damn. Say whatever you want. Hi! Hey, Bronja! What's up? You can see it for yourself. -Mhm. That driver was supposed to give me way. -Mhm, I see. You did a good job to this piece of metal. Leave her, bitch. -Go away, dog. Are you alright? -Yes, I'm fine. Cveto is out of his mind. If it happen to him, he'd say it was god's will. It's a good thing you crashed the car. I'm gonna make a new one out of it! Cveto got so enraged as if it was a write-off. If I can still drive it, it's not a write-off, right? No, it's not. Men complicate sometimes. -Yeah... I'll make a cup of coffee. -Alright. Hey, kid! Come down! Why the hack do you always turn in so early? My friends here are wondering what are you hiding up there? Come on down! Look, who's here! You're stuck up in there like an old bat. Boys, my new apprentice. Sit down, kid. Over there is Cikuta. He's a professor of physics. Yet he can't weld a bulb. You don't weld a bulb, you change the bulb. Oh, I didn't know that... The one who's laughing is Pavlica. Gaja says you're a good worker. You're from Maribor? -Yeah. Stop laughing... Lepec, old bastard! What's up? Smart asses! Here's something for your scorched throats. How is it going, professor? Are you done with lessons? You must be the new first assistant to Gaja. I'm gonna make him an expert. did you take a look at my Mercedes? -Yes. How much damage? -Just some curved metal. A piece of cake for an expert like me. I can make you a new car out of it. Fucking chick! This is her second crash this year. And she drives only up and down the town. I would never employ a chick. Chick's place isn't behind the wheel. Can you imagine a chick in your transport park? Driving a truck, wearing high heels? Holy cow! Are you going to open this bottle or not? Kid, go get us glasses, from above the stove. Go, go... I've got Bracko's wine. Wanna try? Oh, no. -Alright, I will. Morning... Morning... -Morning. Gaja is still sleeping. Last night was a long one. My husband got up on the wrong side of the bed, too. Could you... Boss, hey boss. What? - You've got a visit. Morning, Gaja. -Bronja. Morning. -What's up, Bronja? We haven't started with your Mercedes, yet. Lepec has to bring the spare parts first. It's gonna take us a day or two. I didn't expect you to have it done. It's just... I'd borrow your car. I must go to Austria. Oh, no, Bronja. -Please, Gaja. What if you crash my old Yugo, too? I wouldn't ask you if it weren't so urgent. My friend's sick. I promised her to get pills from Austria. Don't boss me. I won't let women boss me. Light up my cigarette, kid. Only once a woman bossed me. I threw her out of my house. Your apprentice could take me. -No way! The kid's must work! We work from early morning till the evening! No time to shirk work. -Come on. -The kid hasn't got the passport. Sure I have it! -No, you don't! Don't be such a bore, Gaja. It's only a ten-minute drive. It's gonna take us less than an hour. Women! To hell with you! What was God thinking to create a woman? Take her to goddamn Austria. And bump into the first trffic-light... You can't drive anyway. I don't have to put up with any of this anymore. Stupid dog, to hell with you... Could I get a smoke, please? Thanks. The lighter, too. Thanks. It's hot, isn't it? -Yeah... Do you often go to Austria? -Quite often. Do you go to Austria or to get the pills? Don't hold it against me, but I need some silence now. No worries. I've got to drive anyway. I've got a headache. -I'm sorry. Here, fresh up. It's so hot. -Thanks. I'm sorry for that earlier. I was so angry. First I crashed the car, then those pills... I promised my friend to bring them, so I really had to. No worries. You don't have to worry about the car. Don't use the polite form. -Oh, right. It's ok. Finish the cigarette. Your husband has already gone to get the spare parts. The car's gonna be ready in a couple of days. It's great that Gaja has you, you'll speed up his work pace. Gaja knows how to work. He does, but he's never in a hurry. Shit! Oh, I'm sorry... Step on it, step on it! Turn it off. Have you changed the belt yet? -No. Do it. Clean the car and then we're done. Hello, Gaja. -Hello. I brought the spare parts. -Oh, good. Where's the kid? -Djuro! Take the spare parts in. Where are they? -In the boot. Hi, Bronja. -Hello. Wanna coffee? -Is it fresh? Yes, perfect for the skin. Lepec, co you want some too? -No, thanks. It's hot like hell! Fucking Hungary took me all day. Why is my Mercedes still parked outside? THe kid and I will take it in today. -Alright. Wanna some brandy? -No. Coffee? -No. Lepec, listen to me. You've got a pretty nice place here, Gaja. This time I can't make it for free. It's never been for free! I've always paid! When my electricity had been cut off or when I begged you on my knees. Then you paid. This time you gonna pay me in advance. Payment in advance is out of question. I brought the spare parts, you gonna repair the car. Then I'll pay. You know how it works. Pay me in advance or park your Mercedes in your living room. You're wining like an old bat. What's the matter? If you make a fuss about it, you can keep it until winter! Mind your language! -Pay him in advance for peace's sake. You shouldn't have had the car in the first place. You bother me all the time. Cveto this, Cveto that... I drove around in Hungary like insane the whole day! Why do you need the car anyway? To drive up and down the town? -I've got things to do. I wonder what thins. -Important thins. Do you see what is she doing to me? Stop it! Both of you. We gonna take care of the car! Thanks. -You're thanking him? -Who's gonna pay for the repair, me or him? -If you don't pay this time, I'll never lay my eyes on you. You can find yourself another mechanic. Goodbye, Gaja. Bronja, pack your stuff. I mean it this time! Come here. Good girl... Are you hungry, kid? Pavlica brought Macedonian lamb. Straight from the hills. Prepare everything for roasting. We have to find some wood to start the fire. God, is this sheep heavy. Of course it is. Did you think I'd bring some shit? Whose turn is it? -Pavlica, it's yours! Go to hell! You don't know how to play. Why did you throw in the fool? I ran aout of triumphs. Fuck you! You gave them the heart! I didn't have the heart and you stole triumphs! Why do you play if you don't have the triumphs? You took all my triumphs, jerk! And my last king, too. We've got the kings. -My ass you've got kings. Here, I've got king of hearts. There are twenty-one triumphs! Twenty-two. Twenty-one plus the fool. The fool is twenty-second. Kiss my ass. We both know very well who is who here. Yes, wed do! Gaja is Gaja, midn you. Pavlica, leave it. You're a fucked up nerd! If it weren't for my company, you'd all rot here in this godforsaken place. -What did you say? Who paid for renovation of the town park? You? With your workroom? You haven't got money for electricity or for a spritzer. You haven't got a thing! Mother fucker! I can cover you with my money! Fucking political bastard! I'm gonna throw this glass in your head. He said I didn't have for a spritzer! You lost it guys. It's only a game. Sit down! Only if Pavlica apologizes. Pavlica, apologize. -Mhm. Don't you ever raise your voice in my house again! If you don't, I won't either. That's the way to speak. Who's dealing cards? -I am. Let's play our heads off! Oh, look at him! Are you done for today? Ah, to hell! Pour me some schnapps. What's the matter? -Uf... My audience is a bunch of stupid cows. I'm doing my best, and they stuff themselves with food. I play the best music there is, but they only sit and eat. Since days of Yugoslavia people don't know what a good party is. It's like I'm playing to dead people. Nobody cries, nobody drinks a toast, nobody sings from the heart. Dead people. I'm playing hits of Croatian sex-bomb, Severina. Her songs are heartbreaking! Yet nobody cries. Fuckers! Why don't you play her songs for us? For you? -Yeah, for us. Aren't we good enough audience? Play it here? -Yes, here. I can't play under these conditions. There is no electricity. -Of course there is! I need cables for synthesizer, for mixer, for loudspeakers... I've got cables. How many meters do you need? Ten? -Well, um... Twenty? Have we got twenty? -We do. Do you really want me to? Yes! A concertino for your friends. Well? -Alright. Great! Did you see that? Leave this one. I'm going to take it. Take the loudspeakers. Put the bench there. Is it 220 volts? -Yes, it is. I don't want my fuse to go to hell. Put it here so that we'll have a good view. Watch out! Are you drunk? Are we done? -Just a second. Fuck this acoustics it's no good. It's great. Is electricity supply alright? -Yes. And now the very best of my program for you. May I? Why are your eyes So tired and sad? I can't see in them The shine of blue sea. Forget about gloomy days, And give me your hand. Once again tonight, When the Moon's still young I wanna hear you say I love you. I wanna love you, I wanna make you happy. I'm gonna sing for you, I'm gonna be your only songbird. This is fantastic! What do you say, boys? Where did you find this song? Oh, it's nothing. -What's the singer's name? -Severina. Severina Vuckovic. -This is so beautiful. Come watch my performance at the health spa. -Alright, I will. I've got two times four hundred watts there. No! Sing that one. You'll sing another one later. Listen everybody. Why are your eyes So tired and sad? I can't see in them The shine of blue sea. Forget about gloomy days, And give me your hand. Boss, the varnisher called. -Yeah? To see when are we picking up the bumper for the Mercedes. Shall I go get it? -Mhm. You'll go get the LPs. You mean discs? -What discs? You'll get the LPs. -For the Mercedes? Stupid kid! You'll get me Severina's albums. Here's the money. Bring all they've got. From the town? -Yeah. I think it's difficult to get LPs nowadays. Cassettes or CDs perhaps. -Just buy them. Did you hear Malacic singing? Oh, lord! I must find out who this woman is! She's gotta be good if her songs are so great. God, was Malacic singing... Why are you eyes so tired and sad... Bon appetite! -Oh, thanks. Sorry... -What are you doing here? I go shopping along our avenue every day. Is it tasty? -I think so. Want some? No, thanks. -Come on... I don't know... -Come on. I'll have a portion if you gonna have one more. Two more portions here. Without onions for me. -The same for me. Good afternoon. -Hello. I wonder how is he able to walk today. Yesterday he was dead drunk. Yeah? -Loaded. He was my teacher in high school. What was he teaching? -He still is. Physics. Physics. Brrr... No, his classes were never problematic. He was always a bit merry, so he was in a good mood. He'd let us all pass. -Mhm... During tests, he'd doze off, so we cheated freely. He's a soft-hearted man. -He is, isn't he? People say he drinks because his wife bothers him. I don't know. Though she looks like a witch. Here it is. -Thanks. You can take this away. Bon appetite again. -The same to you. Want a drink? -No, thanks. Can I have a sip of yours? -Sure. Thanks. Do you hear, kid? -What? Do you hear her? -I do, boss. This is her. Look at her. -She looks good. Sit down, kid. You've always been deaf and you gonna stay deaf. But remember this: If a mechanic doesn't recognize a nightingale's song, he hasn't got a good ear for a car's machine either. You haven't got a clue what a woman is. Take some. -No, thanks. -You're all skin and bone. Listen to me. I got a call from Sarajevo in 1975. Something cracked up in the production. I was the only one who could fix it. There was no machine that my hands couldn't repair. But, that's not the point. I'm there. We go for dinner. We drink and have a good time. Directors, big chiefs... And then... She Appears. Jelena. A singer to blow your mind away. She was that kind of a woman ...Never mind. Her voice made your tears run through your throat. We sit there. Important chiefs and me, unimportant nobody. They're drooling over her, but she stares at me. She didn't even glance at them. In one moment she gets off the stage. She walks towards me and she sings. She comes up to me. She bows. I close my eyes. And she kisses me. On my forehead. Among all the big chiefs she chose me. Can you imagine how they looked at me? Since then nobody called me Gaja or Piti anymore. They called me "The one who Jelena kissed". And then? -What? Well, did you get any action? Oh, kid. You've always been a fool and you gonna stay a fool. That Jelena kissed me... That was the most beautiful moment in my whole life. Yeah... Why are you all dressed up? Yesterday I ran into a friend of mine. I thought I'd go for a beer. -Sure, go. Boss... Oh, right! You need money. Here. Wait... There. Thanks. I'm not gonna be late. How come you've got so much time off? I don't know. Aren't you working? -I don't have to... It's not that I don't want to, but Cveto and stuff... Are you a loner? -Yes. You? -Me too. It doesn't mean I don't have a company in my head. When I was a kid, my parents took me to a psychologist. Because of my imaginary friends. Then I started hiding them. When did they disappear? -What do you mean? When did they go away? -I don't get it. They're still here. Can't you see them? There. They are there. Walk on a bit. I've got to speak to them. Good afternoon, everybody! Pavlica, my friend! You know girls aren't gonna run after you anymore. You're fifty now. You'll be heading to St. Peter's soon. Here, we brought you this. So that you'll make schnapps. Make sure you gonna share it with your friends. Alright? -Sure. Happy birthday. Attention, please. Please. Our dear Pavlica, my dear Ivan. We love you! W wish you a happy birthday! Let's take our glasses and sing together! For he's a jolly good fellow, For he's a jolly good fellow, For he's a jolly good fellow, which nobody can't deny. Gaja, what's that? -Don't touch it. This is Severina, a singer. I've got all her tapes. I cut out her picture. The other night Malacic played her hits at my place. Oh, yeah? -She's got a voice... I only think of her and I get goose bumps. I see you know what's good stuff. I know her in person. You're pulling my leg. Her manager Tomica is a friend of mine. W had a dinner in Esplanada. I paid for everybody. Her manager just sat there. -Oh, Lepec. You know Severina! What is she like? I wanna know everything. Go, dance a polka! Thank you. Gaja! Especially for you: Severina! Bravo, Malacic! Everybody who's in love, go to the dance floor. Let's put it here. Go away. Be careful. I don't want it to fall on you. I told you twice. Isn't that enough? Go away! Hey, Djuro! -Hello. What happened? -Lepec crashed his BMW. It seems like it's God's will that he crashes all his cars. What about Lepec? Is he alright? I took him to the hospital. They kept him under observation. He got few bruises. He's gonna survive. What's up? -It got stranded. Really? -Yes. I'm gonna get a panel. Fucking experts. A fast car is no good, if you don't know how to drive it. Finish up the cake. -I don't want the cake. But you like this one. It's chocolate one. Would you rather have an ice-cream? -No. This is ok. Eat it up. -I wanna go home. How is Lepec doing? -Good. Yeah... Sara, finish the cake. I got it for you to eat it up. Why did you throw it down? It's nothing. Here you go. -Thanks. Are you free today? -No. I'm picking up Cveto from the hospital. What's the matter, sweetie? She's not like that usually. I wanna go home. -You wanna go home. Alright. When then? -What? When are you free? Don't know. Soon. Let's go. Oh, Slovenes... You're really something. You're happy only when you can save some change. No, not really... -It's true. They put up quite a performance. In a trio. -Yeah, I know. Trio "The Three Chords". -They play folk music... Look, the mudguard, this is all brand new. I fixed the brakes and all. I'm gonna polish your BMW, too. It'll look like a brand new. But, I'd like you to pay me today. Just say how much it is, and I'll pay. A realistic price for work and material... Overcharge me! Say more than it was. You know I'm loaded. Guys, did you see what Gaja made out of my Mercedes? He made a Jaguar. We have to celebrate that. I invite you all to my Havana. Did you have an apparition of Virgin Mary in the car crash? You'll have several apparitions in Havana... Yes, let's go to Havana! -To Havana, of course. Once in a lifetime a man meets a master like you, Gaja. When was the last time you took a shower, man? Here, take my hand. Our handshake should go down in history. -I'm embarrassed now. Embarrassed? Come on, pour us a drink. Have a drink, guys. I'm gonna get changed. I can't go with you. I've got a gig. What did you say, Roki? -I'm playing greatest hits. But we're going, right guys? -Of course, we are. Let's go get the hookers! Leave that. Get dressed. We're going to Havana. What Havana? -To Havana. Don't you know what Havana is? -A tavern? Lepec invited us on his chicks. Go get changed. I'm not going, boss. -What did you say? I'm not going there. -Oh, yes, you are. Where did you find this one? I haven't seen her before. She's from Ukraine. -Oh, from Ukraine... What's her name? Natalija. -Natalija... I want her tonight. You can't get her. -Why not? Because she's new. New girls get one week to acclimatize. Come on, Lepec. -I can't. Here are 200 German marks just let me have her. You gonna get another girl. The best girls are the Czechs. But I want Natalija. You can't get Natalija! You'll get a Czech girl. Alright? Alright. You gonna let me have Natalija next time? Of course. Here you go. This is the girl. Arrange one for me, too. -No problem. Pay first. What? -Pay first. You want me to pay you? Holy cow! I fixed your car. You have to pay me! Holy cow... You didn't pay in advance, you didn't pay for my work. Listen, Gaja... That's not the same. Don't mix these two things up. This house has its own rules. You can get dead drunk here, but you pay to get a fuck. You brought me in here. What were you thinking? I'm gonna sit here and drool over the chicks? You're right, Lepec. What is right is right. The one who can pay, the one can fuck. Fucker! You won't get you willy up anyway. I'll give you a discount on your Mercedes. I don't have any money on me. I'm gonna give you a fifty percent discount, just don't let me fly solo. I wish I could, but my hands are tied. Such is policy of the house. Come on! Let me have a fuck. I'm telling you my hands are tied. Such is the policy. Oh, come on. -I can't. I'll give you even better discount. I'll give you a hundred percent discount. I'll give it to you gratis, just let me fuck tonight. My Mercedes? -Here's my hand. You're giving me my Mercedes for free? Guys, we're leaving... Is that it, Gaja? -Take my word for it. Are you happy now? -Yes. God, is she tall.. What about you two? Don't you want some fun? Djuro, do you have a girl? No. -Go ahead then. It's on the house. -No, thanks. God bless, Piti. -Hello. If you've got only bills, you can take them away. It's a telegram. A telegram for David Slavinec. He lives here? Yes. He's my apprentice. -He has to sign. Really? -Yes. Djuro! You've got to sign a telegram. What will you drink? -Nothing. A schnapps? -No. I'm driving. Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. Here's the telegram. David Slavinec. You're new here, right? -Yeah. Nice... Sing here. And here. Ups, sorry. -It happens. Even to the best. It's nice here, isn't it? -Yes. Alright. Well, goodbye. -Goodbye. Have a nice day. Whose apartment is this? -It's from a friend of mine. From a very good friend of mine. She's the only one who knows all my secrets. Did you like my surprise? -Mhm. Hold me. I wish we could be like this forever. We can be. -No. The timing's not right. Like always. For me the timing's never right. What do you mean? I wasn't even born at the right time. My father was a Montenegrin. He ran away before I was born. What about your mom? She hanged herself in the ninth month. Pregnant? No way. That's horrible! Who brought you up? -Foster parents. How long did you live with them? Until I was eighteen. I couldn't wait to escape. Poor you! Poor you. Tell me something. -What? Something you've never told anybody yet. Do you remember our trip to Austria? No... -Oh, come on" -Sure I do. The pills I bought there were for me. What kind of pills are they? Nobody knows me there, so I can buy stuff. -What kind of pills? For my nerves. I've been taking them for six years. After Sara's birth, things got complicated. Cveto and I got detached. I suffered from panic attacks. All together, I guess. Then I stated with the pills. Better that than alcohol, eh? Since we're together I'm not taking them anymore. So, I'm your pill now? You're a much better drug! I'm gonna get us something sweet. The level of sugar in my blood dropped drastically. Where did you meet Lepec? -Why are you interested in him? Who said I was? Cveto was older, dangerous and handsome. He had money and a motorbike. Everything I wanted. -A gold digger. No. I had to rebel against my parents. They had it all arranged for me. What I'll study, where I'll live... Want some coating on top? Yeah? So I left everything and went with him. It was crazy until it lasted. I thought it was gonna last forever. I could've known it wasn't going to be like that. His business wasn't what I imagined either. Here you go. -Ups! That's my favorite. Hey, boys! -Hello. You're having a break and the cars are waiting? We've just sat dawn. -Sit down. What do I have here? -Don't know. Yes or no? You brought Severina! Give me that! Holy cow! Put this soup away. I spoke to her manager, Tomica. I mentioned Tomica to you, do you remember? -Yeah. She's gonna have a concert here, in Radgona. Where? -In our town. Are you pulling my leg? -No, I'm not. You must get me a ticket. -It's all arranged. Booked. She's gonna have three concerts. You'll get tired of her. Never. What a woman! And she sings so beautifully! I've got all her cassettes. Money and cigarettes. Are we ready? If anybody looks for me, tell them I'll be back by the evening. Lepec and I are going to Hungary to get spare parts. Gaja, do you have a passport? -Sure I do. Why are you asking? You furnish it by yourself? -Yes. It's my hunting lodge. How long are we alone? -Till the evening for sure. Mercedes! It's my Mercedes. You should have checked your passport... Fucking shit! They said they were going to Hungary. Where can I get out? -You can't. Perhaps they forgot something and they'll leave. Thank you. You gonna give me some money for gas. What? Did they leave? -Yes. Lepec's gone. What about Gaja? -He's in the courtyard. He won't come up here for sure. We'll wait here for a while. He'll go to a bar or something. He's never come up here. -Okay. It's gonna be alright. -Hey, kid! Djuro! Djuro! Oh, holy cow! I'm sorry. We arrived to the border and the customs officer found out my passport was no longer valid. I couldn't convince him we're just going to get a couple of screws. I couldn't risk my work for some screws. But I couldn't get these screws here. When I came home I see the workroom's open, the house's open, the kid's gone. I thought to myself he's either in a bar or he's gone to doze off. But now I see you two here. Shit! Listen, boss. I... Lepec's wife. Congratulations. You screwed his wife. You can't change that. Of all the women in the world you picked up her. Look, boss... What are you laughing at? Hm? Listen to me carefully. A man never pisses over a friend's fence. Let alone fuck his wife. What if he smells something? Boss, you don't understand. We're... -What don't I understand? It's none of your business. This is my problem and Bronja's problem. If you don't say a word, everything's gonna be alright. Look who's talking! You're acting like a professor. You gonna give me lectures on psychology? Great! If you're so foolish! I'm not gonna get into debt for your funeral, my kid. They'll bury you on public expenses. Or they won't bury you at all. It's none of my business. Holy cow! Who is concerned about me? Name one person who has ever been concerned about Gaja! Nobody gave shit for me! Why would I give a shit? I'm not gonna give a shit! Where do you drive to work? What? Oh, you mean now. Through Austria. What cards have you got? Good or bad? Like that... Tell the kid to come down so we can play in four. Let him be. He worked hard today. He's tired. Tired? Is he? Hey, Malacic. Come here. Now we can play cards in four. Have you heard what happened? What happened? -There was a raid in Havana. I didn't know. Total mess, I'm telling you. The police broke in. They arrested Lepec and Zobar. -Zobar? -Yes. Why him? -He raped a girl from Ukraine. Hold your horses. How can you rape a hooker? Oh, fuck that. Was that this new, this young girl, um... Natalija? Yes, her. He took her to the room, and she wouldn't fuck him. Zobar totally lost it. He bit off her clitoris. What? He bit her clitoris off using his teeth. Really? -Yes. Mother fucker. -Holy... What did you say he did? With his teeth he bit her clitoris off. The girl has been taken to the intensive care. Disgusting bastard! She's gonna be crippled for the rest of her life. It can't be that bad. -Of course it is. No one should beat a woman even if she's a hooker. I'm afraid Zobar is in deep trouble. I heard he's under suspicion of being a pedophile. Of a what? Speak the language I understand. Holy cow! Pedophilia. -Kids... Are you out of your mind? -No way! I spoke to a friend who works at the police station. He said they've been watching him for some time. Supposedly, he waits for girls in front of the school. He talks sweet to them and then... To hell! Disgusting mother fucker! He's never gonna step into my house again! If he shows up, I'll weld his balls on the wall. I swear. Perhaps it would be right we stood by him now. Pedophilia is a disease. It can be treated. Disease, rubbish! -It's proven scientifically. How would you feel if he attacked your little girl? And stuck his thing in her, um? Watch your head. Holy Cow! Have you read this, kid? He bit off her clitoris. Shocking news. A man observed little girls in front of primary school - He tried to lure them into going for a drink with him. School officials gave brief and reserved comments. Exactly. Nobody knows anything about it now. Boss... -Um? Look, who's here... Don't you dare step out. Close the door! I said close the door. Get out of my sight! I said get lost! Goddamn pedophile! How dare you?! You disgraced the whole town! How does he dare come here? What did he come for, pervert? Hail Mary! Goddamn! That bastard gassed himself only to get on our nerves. Only to bug us. But we won't be bugged. I won't be bugged. I swear, I won't be bugged. I don't give a shit about him. If I had found him, I would have left him rot there in the wood. I'd laugh at him Now he's laughing at us. Perhaps one of us should say few words at the funeral. Who are we to philosophize about life? -You can't talk like that. He was a friend of ours. -That's the way people do. He was a man after all. -Zobar was not a man. He was a spoiled brat. He was forty-two and still lived at his mother's. Is that a man? He was a sucker. A chump. -Come on, boss. -What? What time's the funeral at? -At three o'clock. What's the time now? -Half past two. We should go. -Yeah, let's go. Where's Sara? -She's sleeping. When is Lepec coming back? -Tomorrow. Lepec! Comrade! Where have you been? -Hello, Gaja. When did you come back? -This morning. You don't look very well. What's the matter? Have you got some brandy? -Sure I do. I've got a plum brandy that'll blow your brain out. What's the matter? I can see something's very wrong. When it rains, it pours... What's this? -A lighter. Yes, so? -I found it in our bedroom. Nobody has ever smoked in our bedroom. And we've never used a plastic lighter. I don't get it. -There's nothing to understand. The bitch is fucking with another man. What are you talking about! That's not the proof. There comes the time when you don't need any evidence. And you're not looking for any. Have you ever seen her with another man? Never. Between me and you. Have you ever seen her with another man? I', telling you I didn't. I never go anywhere. I'm fixing your car with the kid. I'm gonna kill the mother fucker. And the fucking bitch. Oh, I almost forgot. The ticket for Severina's concert. You brought me the ticket. Thank you. How much is it? -Forget about it. Thank you so much. I'll never forget that. Look at this! Holy cow... Pour me another one. -Sure. Take it. Come on, take it! -No. What now? Are you a chick? Do you want him to kill you? -Of course not. Take it then! -No. Won't you defend yourself? -No. Sit down. Foolish kid! You've got to defend yourself. If you don't kill him, he'll kill you. -What's the matter with you? What's the matter with you? Defend yourself. Be like the partisans were. Be like, like... What are you laughing at? Be like Bonnie and Clyde. Have you watched the film? You haven't watched it, eh? I watched it. Warren Beauty was in it, a good actor. And that blond chick. What's her name? I can't remember. Something in F -... Faydonnaway. Yes, that's right. I was the same age then as you. I took a girl to the cinema to watch this film in color! I asked her for ages to take off her bra. And to come with me to empty a cashbox. But she wouldn't. She wouldn't do a thing. You've got a chick who would do things. That's why you've got to listen to me. I've seen many dirty things in my life. It's better you die with her this morning than crawl alone in the world and complain all your life. That's why I'm telling you. Take this gun. Take it. -No. What are you afraid of? Djuro, where's your boss? -I think he's in the shower. What the fuck! Gaja! Where are you? We're gonna be late! Ready? Let's go boys! Gaja! -What now? -What's this stain? -Where? Oh, fuck! That's not funny. Let's go, let's go! We're late! I'm not drinking tonight. Watch out. Don't spill ti over me. Where are you going? -To the toilet. You mustn't miss the first song! The first song is always the best. I'm speaking from experience. In the name of the organizer I'd like to welcome you here. I wish you a pleasant evening. But before we begin with the concert, I'd ask the driver who parked their car on the emergency driveway to remove the vehicle. License plate is: MS JI237. Immediately, please. Why are your eyes So tired and sad? I can't see in them The shine of blue sea. Forget about gloomy days, And give me your hand. Tonight, once again When the Moon's still young, I wanna hear you say I love you. I wanna love you, I wanna make you happy. I'm gonna sing for you, I'm gonna be your only songbird. When the ships stop sailing, When the sea calms down, I'll come into your dreams. You'll know then Our love's flame Is still glowing. Tonight, once again... Thank you, my dear all. This was a song for all who are brokenhearted. Long gone emotions. But we are here to have fun! Here's something to cheer you up! Maestro! What's up? -Nothing. What's that? -Oh, leave that. What happened? -It wasn't the first time. Mother fucker! Are you alright? What's the matter? We've got to stop seeing for a while. What does it "for a while" mean? Just that. I can't see you for a while. How long? For a week? For a month? How long? I don't know. Cveto feels something's not right. And I don't have a clear conscience. I'm sorry. I hardly made it here. Understand me, please. Come on, Djuro. -Leave me alone. It's difficult enough for me. Don't make it even harder. I'm making it harder for you? He beats you up and I'm making things harder? This is sick! What's wrong with you? I wait all the time. When you'll have time for me. -I'm married and I've got a child. You could have thought about that earlier! I'm sorry. Come on, don't be like that. Goodbye! Please... I said goodbye! Go out. Go home! Get the fuck out of here! Did we fix your BMW? -Respect to you, Gaja! That's what we'll do: see these keys? They'll wait in my left pocket until you pay. There's no other way for me. I had expenses. Paint, electricity,... I owe money for the material. I worked for free. -Gaja, I made a decision. I'll give you the Mercedes. But the car isn't yours. It's your wife's! That's none of your business! I'll give you the Mercedes. -I need cash. Money. Here and now. Cash! -Stop yelling! Stop yelling! Don't you fake Mr. Nice to me. You've done it many times and you know my heart's soft. If you don't pay me, I'll dismantle this BMW... I'll dismantle it into spare parts! You know me. You know I'll do it! -Look at me! I am. Have I ever left any bills unsettled? Leave that now. -Haven't I always paid you? How much do I owe you? -A lot. -How much? It has accumulated over the years. I have it written down somewhere. Around 400 or 500 thousand. And I cut it down. Here's two thousand marks. Plus a dinner with Severina for you. What did you say? Severina. What Severina? Your favorite singer! She is having a concert on Saturday. I'll talk to Tomica. After the concert I'll bring her to you. To Tomica? -Her manager. You'd arrange a dinner with Severina for me? You've saved my life hundreds of times. Why wouldn't I return the favor? But, she can't come in here. Look at the mess. Of course she will. Tomica and I'll arrange it. I suggest you take a picture with her and hang it in here. So that everybody will see what a boss Gaja tefan is. Piti. -Piti. That's the same. We must drink to this, my friend. Sit down under the grapevine. I'll bring the best wine I've got. I'll take this. What do you think? Beautiful, isn't it? Let's go back to work. That's good. More to the middle. Where's the middle? -Left, left. I said to the left, to the... Holy cow, Pavlica! Is that alright? -That's it. Fix it there. What workers. Holy cow! Severina is going to see this. Great! Phenomenal! -Looking good, eh? Without a doubt. -It's nice. We have arrived. This is my friend Gaja. Hey, Lumpy. Good morning. -Hello. Hi. What's up Lumpy? You know, kid. I can die now. There's nothing more I could wish for in my life. Do you know what's this? Severina herself. She knows what love is. Gaja had a rooster's breakfast with Severina. Generations will talk about it. A rooster's breakfast? What's that? Oh, kid. You still have to learn many a thing... Rooster's breakfast is sex in the morning. It was tender and romantic. She will remember me too, without a doubt. Boss? I don't know how to tell you, but... That thing last night... Generations will talk about it. I'm telling you, kid. Boss, may I tell you something? -Go ahead, kid. Don't lose your temper again. Listen to me till the end. She's pregnant. Is Bronja pregnant? No. It's about Severina. What about Severina? That chick last night was not Severina. It was a hooker from across the border. Lepec arrange with her to trick you. Kid, be careful with what you're saying. I won't have you regard me as a fool. Bronja told me Lepec set it up for you. The hooker looks like Severina and sings her songs in bars. Lepec wanted to fool you. Actually, he just wanted to see if you'd figure it out. Kid, listen to me. If you're lying, you can pack your bag. Do you swear that what you're saying is the truth? I swear. Bronja told me. I'd never make a fool of you. What's up gang? What was it like last night? Good, eh? What's that sour face for? What's the matter? Don't you ever step in my house again. Uf, that's to thank me! Uf, that's to thank me! I brought you a woman dressed like Severina. I went to look for her over the border. For you! Did your really think I'd bring the real Severina? Here, to this godforsaken place? Do you know who is she? She is Severina Vuckovic! And who are you? Gaja Pitek... Come on, Gaja. What's the matter with him? He looks like a mummy. What's the matter with him? Doesn't he like jokes anymore? Did you really have to? Now you gonna hassle me too? Have you got a lighter? Mother fucker. Lepec! The door. Wait. Hello. -Hi. Sit down. I'm glad you're here. Yeah... This is for you. Oh, nice. Um, good. Grapes. I'll have a bite. It's good. I'll have more later. How is it going? Have you got work? It's alright. Take care of the workroom as if it was yours. When I come home it all has to be shipshape. Screws and tools all in apple-pie order. A mechanic is like a mathematician. He calculates it all, he defines it all. But with women it's like that: Even if your heart belongs to one woman, you've got to save a little piece to yourself. I know that very well. I was with the right woman only once in my lifetime. But I was left empty-handed. I'm telling you. If a mechanic too tolerant with a woman, He is also too tolerant with his screws. Then it starts leaking, and it leaks and leaks. You don't notice it at first. One day you realize that everything's flooded. And the machine doesn't work anymore. But it's too late then. If you listen to me, you won't have to worry about anything. You'll have a roof over your head, and you'll live happily. Yeah, that's the way of the world. I've seen too much of everything... in my life.
