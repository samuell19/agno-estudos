(suspenseful music) (upbeat music) - [Voiceover] A few years ago African honey bees were imported to Brazil. They bred with the local species producing a new, aggressive and dangerous strain that, without provocation, attacked and killed countless animals and scores of humans. These bees spread uncontrollably throughout the country. Each year, the area infested by the killer bees grows larger and larger. At this moment, South America has been completely invaded. So far, there are no means to prevent these deadly insects from taking over the entire Western hemisphere. (guitar playing) - Papa, I'm afraid to go in there. - Afraid? Nothing to be afraid of. We use plenty of smoke. Bees go to sleep. (suspenseful music) (crickets chirping) (suspenseful music) Here, hold this. - Papa, what does that say? - It says honey. Plenty of honey in there. When a man has only one son and four daughters, he has to gather plenty of honey for the market. Come on. (suspenseful music) There must be 20 or 30 pounds in each box. And, I heard in the village that the Americans keep the best hives in their cage. (suspenseful music) (buzzing) Smoke them. Smoke them. Stop them. More smoke. - [Kid] I'm out. (yelling) - Franklin, when are you coming to bed? - What's the matter, can't you sleep? - Well, sleeping isn't what I had in mind. My darling, you work too hard. (speaking Portuguese) - Yes, what is it? - Golden bees are going crazy. Somebody out there are fooling with them. - Let's go see. - Franklin. - Yeah? - Your veil. - Yeah. Let's go. (buzzing) (chirping) - Somebody try to rob the honey. - God damn it. Instead of raiding the domestic hives they had to meddle with these killer bees. - I hope they got good legs for running. - [Kid] Help me. (yelling) - Help me, help me. (yelling) Help me, help me. It hurts, it hurts bad. Help me. Help me, help me, help me. Help me, help me. Help me, help me. - Franklin, come on. Rosa's serving breakfast. - [Franklin] Coming. - Rosa, again? Oh. - Hi. - Hello. - Just in time, I see. What's this? Looks delicious. - (speaking Portuguese) again. - What's the matter, don't you like it? - Oh sure. It's just that, Rosa's trying to get me pregnant. - [t wasn't meant to, Dr. Miller. She eat plenty (speaking Portuguese), have plenty babies. - By the time we get around to that Rosa, it will be Mr. Miller who will need to eat the (speaking Portuguese). - Last thing we need is to go around ingesting all the local, native fertility drug. - Was there much damage to the hives last night? - No, the robber's didn't get far. I guess they weren't prepared for the kind of reception they got. - Oh, the poor fools. - We've got to have better security. Men to patrol the grounds at night. - Wasn't there money in the budget for that? - There was and it was approved but like so many other things, it just never got transferred down here. It's something that's been going on for a long time. I just realized it last night when I went over the account books. Sandy, somebody in the agriculture department had the skimming of funds for my project and all the other ag projects in South America. It amounts to half a million dollars all told. And, now I think I know who's been doing it. - Oh. And, then you better do something about it. - I will now that I have the evidence. (crashing) What the hell? (people yelling) (glass breaking) - Mr. Miller! Many men coming outside. Plenty angry. - Men? Let's take a look. - Franklin, don't you out there. - You stay here, Sandy. (people yelling) Wait. What do you men want here? Alright, alright, I understand. Now listen to me. I know you no like devil bee, but I did not bring devil bee. Devil bees already here. And, next year more. In two years, many, many more (speaking Portuguese) Unless, unless I fix devil bee so she not sting so bad. Then devil bee good bee. Make plenty honey. You get honey, sell in market, make plenty money. But, I need time. Time to turn (speaking Portuguese) into good bee. So, go home now. Please go, go home. (speaking Portuguese) Oh no. - Rosa, rush to town and get the police. Go on, the Policia! - Devil bees killed my son. You killed my son. (people yelling) - Wait, wait. No. Sandy. Sandy. What are you doing, you fool. Sandy. Sandy. - He want to (speaking Portuguese). Frank, Frank. - There's not time for this. Come on, let's get out of here. (glass breaking) (glass breaking) (buzzing) - Franklin! - Wait, my books. - Franklin! Franklin! (yelling) Frank, oh, Franklin! - Sandy. (somber music) (horns blowing) - I'm sure that most of you heard about the unfortunate incident that occurred at our genetic research station in Brazil last month. The scientist who was killed in that tragic accident was a close friend and colleague of Dr. Hummell here. Who has spent his life in the study of bee communication. Now, there's no question that the African bee is dangerous. And, that's all the more reason why we need international cooperation. - It seems to me more proper to direct your request for funds to the organization of the American states. Would it not? Isn't it really your problem? - As far as danger to livestock and people is concerned, yes. But, as our report makes clear, if we can successfully develop a new hybrid form of this species, we can double the production of honey and other bee products. - That will be very important for my country. - And, at the same time, this new hybrid bee would be less aggressive. - Be aggressive in the modern world is necessary for us developing societies to eliminate the last vestiges of the colonialism. - Gentlemen. The issue here is a matter of economic benefit to all developing countries. More and more, honey is being substituted for sugar in various food products. (speaking Spanish) - What is wrong with sugar? Sugar uses the label of the people for they own economic good. - What we need and badly is a secure place in which to conduct our experiments. We believe that within one year's time. (yelling) - [Voiceover] You say one year now. Later, you will ask for your own five year plan. (laughing) - Wait. Under the proper conditions. - You are out of order. (glass breaking) (buzzing) (yelling) (speaking foreign language) (jazz music) - Oh, would you punch six for me, please? - Sure. - What are you doing? - Just relax. - Give me that. - [Sandy] What? No. (screaming) - What the hell you got there? - How the hell do you get it open? (screaming) (suspenseful music) (screaming) (glass breaking) (screaming) (honking) (buzzing) - Um, Dr. Norman I presume. - Mrs. Miller? - Yes. - Well, come in please. - Thank you. Are you alright? - You have a guest. I'm terribly sorry. - That's alright. - [Sandy] No, no. Maybe if you can just find me a hotel then I won't bother you. - No. This Alicia Encino. - Encinas. - Encinas. This is Mrs. Miller. - How do you do? - Fine, thank you. - Here, let me your coat off. I didn't even know it was raining outside. Are you sure you're alright. You've got quite a bruise there on your forehead. Alicia was just leaving, really. - I'm terribly sorry for spoiling your evening. I really. - Oh listen, you better let me have a look at that. That could be more serious than you imagine. Come on. - No, it's really - Hey, hold onto me. Hold onto me. - Yeah, I just felt woozy. - Sit down. I just wanna say I'm sorry about your husband. I know that the failure of the project wasn't his fault. I'll be right back. - You know it's really important to me that I'm able to help finish his work because I really wanna show that he was on the right track. - I understand. - But, boy I'm not any good at all this intrigue. I lost all of my things. No, no, I was so afraid to go back for my bags. I didn't want to become involved with the police. - Well, it's understandable that you got through customs alright. - Oh yeah. Well, they were hassling some... ow. Well, they were hassling some poor fellow with a beard and jeans and I just kind of slipped by looking very respectable. I simply don't look respectable now. (speaking Spanish) - God, the bees. - Alicia? - Hold it. - What? - Just don't move. Don't move. - See. Aw. It's already lost it's singer. - What does that mean? - Oh, it probably stung your friend. - Well, will she be alright? - She'll be dead in a couple of minutes. - Wait a minute, I mean my friend. - Oh sure. No, she'll be fine. Only a couple of got out and it's not enough to be dangerous. - Certainly look like you know what you're doing with those things. - I'm terrific with one at a time. It's when they come after you by the thousands that I get very nervous. - Well, do we still have enough to form a colony? - The queens and the drones are sealed up and that's all really that we need. Except we need a safe place to keep them. - Well, your Uncle Ziggy's got that and he'll be back soon. So, look, stay here. Really, you've gotta be tired and the tranquilizer I gave you is gonna be taking effect so I'll sleep on the couch. - Oh no. - Really, I insist. Please. I'll be right out here. If you need anything. - Good morning, Doctor. - Good morning. Did you sleep well? - I slept wonderfully. Thank you very much. - Good. - You do all that karate stuff? - I used to. I found it was a good hobby in New York. - So I've noticed. Maybe you should teach me. - Well, the first thing you'd have to learn is how to tie your belt. - Well, it's not quite my size if you've noticed. - Do you mind? - No. - You put it around double. - Oh, it's like a Chinese, uh, kimono. Yeah? - [Dr. Norman] It's Japanese. Really? - Of course. Here, like that. - That's terrific. You didn't make your bed. - No. - Shall I make it? - Sure, thank you. Would you like some breakfast? - Oh, wonderful. Do you need some help? - No, it's all prepared. (doorbell ringing) - Someone's at your door. - I'll take care of it. - Hi, you're home. Good. - And, where have you been? - I was in the country. What I just realized I have forgot Sandra was coming in yesterday. Have you heard from her? - Well, actually she's uh. - Uncle Ziggy. - Sandra. (speaking foreign language) - You look wonderful. This is my niece, Sandra Miller. - We've met. - Yes, so I see. Sandra, I'm glad you're here. But, don't you think you should have waited a little longer? A decent period of mourning before you.. - Now look here old man, it wasn't like that. Not at all. - Of course not. Uncle Ziggy, don't be silly. - Zigman, how bout some breakfast? You're probably hungry after chasing all those bees around the mountain. - Yes, thank you. Smells like fresh coffee. - It is. - Here, why don't you let me do this. You go ahead and sit down. - Yeah. Let the women serve us. Says the red coat mason. Uncle Ziggy, would you like some salt in your coffee? - Tell me, how are the bees? - Okay. At least the Queen is and that's all that matters. - Any trouble with customs? - No, but we were lucky that we didn't. I can't understand why we didn't get official permission to import the bees. - We'll be lucky if the department of agriculture doesn't ask any questions if we come up with some results later. - If even through official channels, it will be too late. John, some people from big business want to talk to us. Can you make a meeting tomorrow? - Big business? Why, what do they want? - What you think they want? Money, profits. Honey producers, cosmetic manufacturers. And, we need their money for our researches. - Okay, if you say so. - You must show them how dangerous these adult honey bees are. - I can understand your interest in our work from an economic point of view but it'll be quite awhile before we can find out whether these African bees can be made less dangerous while not losing any of their beneficial qualities. - Well, better a little more aggressive than lazy. That's the American tradition after all. - Are you say you want to use these killer bees now? Just to get more honey? - My company is interested in the cosmetic value of the royal jelly which bees make. Now, these special bees make very special royal jelly, mustn't they? - No, nope, not at all. - [Voiceover] That doesn't matter. - Dr. Norman. Dr. Hummel. We're businessmen, not scientists. Let me come to the point. We want you to collaborate with us. And, I might say that we can be very generous. - Mr. Winkler, Mr. Blankeley and Mr. Green. - Gray, Irving Gray. - Irving. Let's get this straight. You wanna take these Killer bees and actually release them in the United States? - No, no. Not released exactly. We'll have them well under control. - Impossible. You don't understand. The mellifera adansonii has caused the deaths of hundreds of people in Brazil alone. God knows how many people in Africa. - Now, listen Norman. If you don't cooperate with us. There are other ways to get insects into the country. Besides, I don't believe these scare stories. How do you know the bees are so dangerous, young lady? - Because her husband was killed by them. Let's go. Sandra, Mr. Hummel. - John, we must work fast. They bring these bees here, just as we did. We must forget about breeding them. We must find a way to destroy them instead. (frogs croaking) (guitar playing) - Julio. Julio Cesar. (speaking foreign language) (upbeat guitar music) - Julio, Julio Cesar. I've got some news for you and some money. - What kind of news? And, how much? - How would you like to spend your vacations in the United States? All expenses paid by my company. - You better not be cheating me, man. - I'm not, it's for sure. - [Voiceover] Mexico City control tower to 5824. Permission granted for emergency landing. Use landing strictly to east terminal. Ambulance and paramedic services ready. (sirens wailing) - Your attention, please. This the Captain, Captain Reydel. Mexican authorities are presently conducting a thorough investigation of the airplane. Please bare with this temporary inconvenience. We will be resuming our flight to New York City shortly. Thank you. (sirens wailing) (upbeat music) Did you find out what killed the passenger? - Yeah, sure. He was wearing this belt. Be careful. - [Voiceover] Look. - [Voiceover] Where'd he come from? - [Voiceover] Stand back. - [Voiceover] Who is he? (fun music) (buzzing) (suspenseful music) (gasping) (bird squawking) (buzzing) (suspenseful music) - Artificial sunlight. So you can have any season you'd like. Or any time of day. As you know bees orient themselves according to the sun So east to west. We can have what we want. Then we just feed the information into the computer and we're geniuses. - Oh, that's fabulous. Did you design all of this? - Well, most of it along with Ziggy's help. We wanted to see what various kinds of conditioning would have on bees. I guess we can go now. - Well, I guess you haven't heard the news this morning have you? Bout the bees on the airliner? - Bees on the airliner? No, why, what happened? - A man was Killed. I know him. He used to work for us in Brazil. Tried to smuggle a colony of adansonii into the United States. - Oh, good God. Did any get loose? - Only on the airliner. Plane almost crashed. Had to land in Mexico City. - Well, there you are. I mean, they're at it already. The greedy sons of bitches. I mean, we're gonna have to work even harder. - Well, hey. You need your rest, too. I mean, your brain doesn't work efficiently if it's over tired. - I'm alright. You know, I think I may have come onto something last night. The microwave radiation just may do it after all. Trouble is it was also just absolutely unpredictable. - John, I mean you're being careful with that radiation, aren't you? I mean, we wouldn't want you altering your chromosomes or altering your genes. - No, these are, uh, highly focused instruments. They're not like radar beams or microwave ovens. Don't worry. Why are you so interested in what's in my genes? - Oh well, personally I'm not. It's just that you may want to use 'em sometime. (buzzing) (dreadful music) - Alright now. Are you all ready for the hike? We must all stay together and... (loud buzzing) (screaming) (ominous music) - More to the... More to the right. More. That's fine. Yeah. Back a little bit. Yeah, that's good. I couldn't work this without you. - I'm only good Uncle Ziggy 'cause I work cheap. You know I work cheap. (relaxing music) (suspenseful music) (buzzing) (screaming) (fun music) - Hey kids. Dinner's ready. (suspenseful music) (buzzing) (screaming) (happy music) (buzzing) (horse whinying) - See this brown bag? - Yeah. - You think you can catch me some bees and put 'em in that. Well, you see, I got a little problem with my legs called rheumatism. It hurts, it hurts all the time. - Yeah, so. - You might not believe it. The bee stings make it feel better. So, what I want you to do is to take this paper bag and catch me four five bees. Bring 'em to me. But, don't let 'em sting ya. They can only sting one time. Then they die. - Okay, you got a deal but shove over the bread first. - Okay. One buck now and one buck when ya bring me the bees. Good luck. - Hey whatcha guys doing? - What's it to you? - Catching bees for some old jerk. - You're putting me on. What do you mean catching bees? - No shit. The old guys paying us to catch him some bees. - Yeah, how much is he paying? - None of your god damn business. - Two bucks. - Two bucks for bees. (suspenseful music) (buzzing) - Well, ya have any luck boys? Guess I owe you another buck. Now we're gonna see if this is gonna work. - You mean to tell me you're gonna actually let 'em sting you? - If they will. We'll see. (fun music) Oh. Oh. (laughing) (buzzing) (playful music) - This morning several clouds of the so-called killer bees was seen over the San Diego Bay area. It is incredible that in spite of having the most sophisticated weapons and advanced defense systems, the United States seems completely defenseless against this invasion. More news about the bees in just one minute. - Sheba, a new discovery in natural beauty cremes. The same formula used by the Queen of Sheba which devastated the Great King Solomon and made him her slave. What was her secret? Royal jelly. And, now the Proctor Benny company has rediscovered this long lost miracle produced only by a rare species of African bee. - That's like playing a cigarette commercial after a documentary on lung cancer. - Two farmers were killed today in Arizona, bringing the toll of deaths caused by the bees to a frightening total of 46 to date. - Damn red tape. Takes weeks for the simplest request. Here we are, that far from the answer and they're gonna be spraying half the country with insecticides. Hundreds of square miles poisoned. Made sterile for years to come. - Uncle Ziggy. Why, why can't we use that new pherone tomorrow? - It's not possible. We need witnesses, observers. It's gotta be official or else it's useless. - Well, it isn't for us. I mean, if we know for sure and if you're convinced, I mean, you could persuade them to give us more time, couldn't you? - Maybe. But, I'd have to have a lot of hard facts and figures and under natural conditions, not just in the lab. - And, you will have to find a farm somewhere. Tomorrow would be a good day. I know where you should look, too. But, you must be very careful. - I'm ready. - So am I. - It's dangerous. - Well, of course. That's why you need me along. (engine roaring) (buzzing) - It's amazing. Ziggy knew exactly where to look for those wild bee hives. Give me the smoker. - Oh, is that that radar station you were talking about? - Yeah. Radiation from that dish is so intense there's no telling what it would do to you. I wonder what would happen to our adansonii if they got a good dose of that radiation. - I don't know, Doctor, that's your department. - Go down. (suspenseful music) The lower one will be easier to experiment with. Let's be careful, huh. (suspenseful music) I'll smoke 'em and quiet 'em down a little bit. - Well, they're adansonii. - That's our greedy, smuggling friends in business. Okay? - Yeah. Well, here goes the pherone. - Good. Let's get out of here. (suspenseful music) I don't know what's happening but something's going on here. - Boy, are they confused. They are really confused, John. - I think they're... in fact they're attacking each other right here. Look. - I can't. - What are you doing? - Looking for something. Ah ha! - What? - I found her. - Be careful. - Yeah, she's dead. Her own workers have killed her. Oh. - Your Uncle Ziggy was right. - Oh John. - [Both] It works. It works. Oh. Oh, it works. Oh. (buzzing) - Oh, John it works. Oh. - Quick, get in there. Get in, you'll be safe. (happy music) (cheerful music) - Our next entry, South Covina. Don't forget the theme of this year's Rose Parade. On the road to happiness. Beautiful. (bongos playing) Just fantastic. 4500 hand sewn Azaleas. (clapping) (cheerful music) (suspenseful music) (buzzing) (cultural music) (cheerful music) (live band music) Sensational. Boy, I tell ya, that Millikan High School marching band certainly has one of the very best baton twirlers. (whistling) (buzzing) (suspenseful music) I've never seen anything like this before in my life. It looks like bees. Thousands of 'em. (buzzing) (screaming) (screaming) (suspenseful music) (screaming) (calm music) - Close the door Sue, will you. - Take it easy, Sam. It wasn't the hives, it was that Dr. Morris. The one you picked to bring the frozen bee sperm from Brazil. He stole some, sold it to the competition and let their bees escape. - Now the question is, what are we gonna do about it. - Well, it's my responsibility as an Undersecretary of the Department of Agriculture to come up with some recommendation. Now, the only thing I can see to get out of this mess is to find a way to kill these bees. All of them. - All of them? - We just got the new project started. This year we expect to show record profits. - Now look, look. I can't hedge on this one. I don't want an investigation started and I'm sure you don't either. Now I decided I'm going to give all the funding to this Dr. Hummel. Give it to him slowly. I'm sure you realized that this got more involved in here than profits. I'm sure you know what I mean. - So, as you may know, the Queen bee leaves her swarm from the hive in order to start a new colony somewhere else. Now the drones, that is the fertile males, must mate with her on this so-called nuptial flight. They find her by scent. That is, the Queen bee gives off a chemical odor which the drones can detect for hundreds of yards. So what Dr. Hummel proposes is the synthetic manufacture of this chemical, which is known as a pherone, and it can be sprayed into the atmosphere and we believe cause the drones to become confused and attempt to mate with each other rather than with the Queen bee. - Gentlemen, Dr. Norman, I'm sold. You have made a brilliant presentation and I feel that your solution will resolve all this problem. - Well, uh, there are certain benefits. - On balance, it's worth considering. - Congratulations. - Thank you very much. Thank you. (somber music) (buzzing) - Sandra. Now you will see something frightening. The battle to the death between the new Queens. It's survival of the fittest or rather of the most brutal. It affects the human political process and event. - Uncle Ziggy, that really hardly seems democratic. (suspenseful music) - By the way, do you still have all of Frank's notes? - Yes, I've been typing them up for you. And, I also have his account books, too. And, Uncle Ziggy, I've been meaning to ask you, would you take a look at them with me? Franklin, just before he was killed, he was very upset about something he found out. Something about the money. - Yeah, I'll have a look at them later. - Okay. (happy music) Well, hello stranger. How was the conference? - You won't believe it. - Well, try me. - The Agricultural Department's gonna fund us. They're gonna give us everything we want. I've got it right here in black and white. - Oh no they, no. There's gotta be a catch. - Yeah, there's a catch. We can eliminate the killer bee without endangering any other species. - Oh. Oh good. Let's go tell Uncle Ziggy. - We got the deal. Ziggy. We got the deal. We got the deal. They're gonna fund us. They're gonna give us everything we want. We can start work on your idea right now. - Wonderful. I knew you could persuade them. What about your own progress? The microwave experiments. - I've run into a dead end. - So. - Yeah, at least for the moment, Doc. Well, I know that I can alter the genetic structure of the bees and I produced some pretty strange behavior but I don't know what it means and I haven't made them any less dangerous, that's for sure. - What strange behavior? - Well, they group together in the oddest configurations like, this may sound like the strange shreds of an old work mine, like an electronic circuit. Like the wire printout of a computer. - Did you record the sounds? - Yes. - That's good. Give me the tapes. I should like to hear them. - What would expect to find? - I don't know but I've been discovering that they communicate not only by movements but with sounds as well. Sounds which the human ear cannot distinguish. Look, I'll show you. This is the dance. The language of the bees. The dance is heard by the scout bees. (buzzing) She's telling him about 100 meters to the northwest. See, two rotations to the left and they transit at twelve meters and that pause there. So far it is clear. But, how do they know about the quantity and the quality? Listen. See, she's telling them it's pretty good but there's not much of it. So, see, only a few workers leave for that particular flower. - That's amazing. How did you figure that out? - The computer. I have a program now. It's very much like translating an unknown language. If you have enough inscriptions, you can discover the pattern. - But, can you talk back to them, too? - Ah, I am working on that. - What kind of a bee is that? - An artificial one. Sandra make it for me. It is controlled by little wire under the entrance stage. See, now he's saying which way to go and how far. See, two turns to the left and back five centimeters. The workers understand that and off they go. - There's nothing artificial about that. (laughing) - Hey that kiss is for me, not for you. After all, she is my niece. - That's adding incest to injury. - But it proves her good taste. - If she had good taste, that kiss would've been for me. - Well, that just shows I have good taste. (suspenseful music) - Eisel. Come here. Quit moving. Oh, you stupid thing. Eisel. Go back in hole. Go home now. Go home, go to sleep. Go back in, go back in. Come on. Oh, you're truant. Student painter. (buzzing) - [Voiceover] Oh, thank you. - Dr. Norman. - [John] Mr. Brennan. It's very nice seeing you, my boy. - Good to see you again. - Sir. - I'm sorry. We couldn't make it any sooner. We got tied up in that damn traffic. - Oh, don't worry about it. No problem, no problem. - Oh and I believe you know Mr. Winkler and Mr. Blankeley. - Absolutely. - Yes, yes, we've met. - Dr. Norman. - You gentlemen working with the administration now? - Well, not exactly but the industry has a great stake in this matter, you understand. - Yes. - Dr. Norman, usually it's not sound policy to take action on a unproven theory such as yours without first doing extensive testing as you well know. - Yes, I know indeed. - However, the President has asked that we try everything possible to be able to resolve this situation. There's been over 200 deaths including many children and thousands ahead of livestock. - Look, Mr. Brennan. We are prepared to cover an entire infested area within one week. I mean, that's one of the advantages of this method as opposed to insecticides. One teaspoon of pherone can cover a thousand acres. - Then if it doesn't work it doesn't cost us that much. - But, it will work and furthermore there will be no damage to the environment at all. - Well, wonderful then. Wonderful. Whenever you're ready just start out there. - We're ready right now. - Just let us know what you need. - Okay. (playful music) (buzzing) - [ Dr. Hummel] See, I can do it, too. (buzzing) (drums playing) - Dr. Moorhead, this is General Cradick. Dr. Moorhead has been appointed U.N. observer. - As you know General, this procedure requires surgical precision. - [General] I believe that serious circumstances require serious measures. - Well, we're right on time. The weather's perfect. Let's hope they do it right. - We'll isolate the areas where the climate's most consistently temperate or hot as in the desert or in this region south. And we'll plan attack squads in a circular pattern surrounding the principle breeding areas move in toward the center. Try to stop the spread. - What about the nearby towns? Will they be in any danger? - We'll drop in supplies on an as needed basis to those places that we can't evacuate. - Fine, well, what about the rest of the country? - Well, the colder regions will inhibit the breeding. We don't expect any further spreading of colonies and that'll give us sufficient time to plan our maneuvers in the areas most hard hit. - I don't know, Dr. Norman but I hope for all of us that you know what you're doing. - I hope so, too. (hopeful music) - Dr. Norman, the 17th squadron is airborne. Operations will commence over the east central sector at 1200 hours. - Good. Did you hear that? Mark it. Norman here. Terrific. Okay, talk to you later. Northwest 27, secure. - Northwest 27, check. - South central 12 secure. - Norman here. Yeah, I hear ya. Are you kidding? I think it's marvelous. It's finally working out. - Dr. Norman, I never thought it'd be quite that easy. - I never had any doubts. (suspenseful music) (buzzing) - St. Louis, Missouri. Denver, Colorado and New Orleans, Louisiana were finally declared killer bee free areas as of today. Those were the last of the major cities afflicted by the invasion of the Apis Mellifera Adansonii. It has been an outstanding scientific triumph for the United States. - Here it is. Finally. It says they've covered all but the last three sections in Oregon and I got a call from John and he said it worked just as we'd hoped. - Oh yeah? - Oh yeah. - This is very good. Oh, Sandra. I've been looking over these account books of Frank's as you told me to. And, he left some notes here, too. - Do you know what he meant by them? - I think so. Somebody has managed to rip off a lot of money between the Agricultural Department and South America. Small wonder Frank couldn't make any progress. - Oh, Uncle Ziggy. If we could only prove that. - Oh yeah, yeah. But, we must find out who is it. Maybe look at the cancelled checks at the bank in Washington. - Oh, it doesn't matter who. I mean, let the police find that out. It's enough for me if we could just vindicate Franklin. I'd like to show that we didn't have a chance in Brazil. - Oh yeah, I understand. You know, I have decided to accept that invitation to go to Washington next week after all. - I thought you didn't want any honors. - Ah, but, I have other reasons. You know, as the nectar attracts the bees so as the honors attracts the money. - Uncle Ziggy, you're getting greedy. - But in a very good cause. - It's for you sir. - Hello. - You've done an excellent job, Dr. Norman and I sincerely appreciate it. And, please extend my congratulations to Dr. Hummel. - I surely will. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Good day, Mr. President. (somber music) - Oh, Uncle Ziggy. Uncle Ziggy. You never watch that step. - Oh why, do they do something? - Oh, Uncle Ziggy, I have wonderful news. I just got a call from John. Well, don't you wanna know what he has to say? - Oh yeah, what did he have to say? - He says that there's been no sign of anymore adansonii anywhere. - Ah, good. - And, he says he's coming back tonight and I'm going out to the airport to meet him. - Oh yeah, this is good. - Well, we may be late so don't wait up. - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah Sandra. Go ahead, I'll be alright. We forgot. Oh. - What? - Oh. - Are you alright? Uncle Ziggy, are you alright? - Oh. - Are you alright? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Just for a minute I thought this there was something wrong with this printout here. But this is alright. They're alright. - Uncle Ziggy, I thought there was something wrong with you. - Nah. - Oh, Uncle Ziggy. Oh. You know, you've been so kind. I don't know what I would've done without you. - Oh, (speaking German) (speaking German) - Oh (speaking German) with you, it's no (speaking German) me. - Dr. Hummel, on behalf of the people of the United States and I'm pleased to say that we've been able to eliminate the agis amiferas bolividi. - Apis mellifera adansonii. - Well, the killer bees. - Thank you. - Is it true that there's no more threat to the United States? - Absolutely no more threat. We've been able to - This is Sherie Reddick. TV Witness News, Channel 34, Washington DC. (people talking) - Dr. Hummel, please. - Yes. - And, Dr. Hummel is there, is there.. - That's all there is gentlemen. Thank you very, very much. Thank you for coming, certainly appreciate it. Dr. Hummel, thank you very much. - Excuse me, please. I must talk to you privately. - Certainly, won't you step right over here. Sit down. - Yeah. I have brought you this. Some pages from the account books of Dr. Franklin Miller. But, if you study his notes, you will see there was someone in your own department who was stealing funds from the project. - Really? - There is no question about it. - Who else knows about this? - Only my niece and Dr. Norman. - Well, this is a very serious situation and it could lead to danger. Then, I can assure you that we will make an investigation to the end, no matter where it leads. - Yeah, good. I am glad to have been of service. Now I must return to my work. - Well, I'm sure you have many more important things to do, Doctor. Thanks again for coming. Appreciate it. Oh, Doctor, you're forgetting this. - Oh yeah. My niece will want to keep this. - Fine, thank you for calling. Hello. This is one of your clients. I wanna take out a contract with some of your people. I want the very best available. - Is it clear? - Yes. - I'm gonna crawl over the wall. (ominous music) (dogs barking) - Give me your luggage. Come In. Let me look at you. I just wanna look at you. - I missed you. - No, I wanna look at you. - I really love you, Sandra. (romantic music) (suspenseful music) - Be quiet. (speaking German) (sad music) Sandra? - That's him, McGrout. Kill him. (gun fires) Finish him off. We'll wait for the others. (gun fires) (buzzing) (suspenseful music) - Hey John. Do you hear that? - Yeah, the bees are out of their hives. - Well, at night? I mean, that's not normal. - Something's wrong. (suspenseful music) (buzzing) Christ. - Uncle Ziggy. Uncle Ziggy? - Ziggy. - What happened? - Ziggy? Ziggy? - Uncle Ziggy. Oh my god. Oh god, careful. - [John] Let me look. Christ. I'll call an ambulance. The line's dead. We, we better get him to the car. - We can't carry him out. - I'll roll him. - Roll him. Careful, careful. He's hurt awfully bad, John. - It's useless. I have too much blood loss. Please, listen to me. - Who did this to you, Ziggy? - It doesn't matter. They know. - [John] Who are they? - The bees. They know everything. They are a new species. They're too smart for the pherones. It's all in the tapes, Sandra. It's ironic. They can think like men. They can think. Think like a man. But, they need your help. You will not fail them? - I won't fail them. - Where are you? Auf wiedersehen. - Oh, John. Oh, Uncle Ziggy. Uncle Ziggy. (suspenseful music) - Get down. (thuds and groans) (glass breaking) (man screaming) (gun fires) (woman yelling) (woman yelling) - Liz, good morning. What are you doing? - Mr. Brennan, there's a bee in here and I can't seem to get it out. - Possibly likes your perfume. - There it goes finally. Just like it saw you and flew away. - Are there any messages? - On your desk. Is there anything else I can do for you? - Not right now, dear. I have to make a private call, alright. Hello, this is your client. Why haven't I heard from you? Look, I have a contract. I want it to be taken care of immediately. (suspenseful music) (buzzing) (glass breaking) (alarm sounding) (exciting music) (bombs exploding) (fast paced music) - Just weeks after it was thought there were no more killer bees, Chicago, Houston, Detroit, San Francisco and Philadelphia were declared disaster areas. This is the worse outburst of the plague. It seems to be completely out of control. Stay tuned to your emergency broadcasting station regarding security measures and please keep your family and pets indoors at all times. (fast paced music) (babies crying) (woman screaming) (people screaming) - Tell them that this is the strongest concentrate we can prepare. - Excuse me, Doctor. Do these blow up? - No, they won't explode but you must be very careful with the fumes. Keep your windows down. Okay, rush 'em off to the base. (upbeat music) (buzzing) (suspenseful music) (screeching and crashing) (car exploding) (upbeat music) (crashing) (crashing) (exploding) (fast paced music) - What the bloody hell is going on? - I don't know, Doctor. - Florida central. Get me Dr. Norman. - Yes, this is John. I know what's happening. The pherone isn't working. - [Voiceover] There's gotta be an explanation. - There's been a mutation. A new strain and well, it's out of control. - You mean those bees have become immune to the pherone? - I really don't know. Hummel is dead and there doesn't seem to be anything we can do against them. - Well, why the hell aren't you here? - Because we're trying to decipher the language patterns of the bees. - You're doing what? Are you mad? You mean you want us to conduct peace negotiations with bugs? - Either that or you can consider praying. (buzzing) Let's give it one more trial. - You are a glutton. (buzzing) I'm tired. (buzzing) (suspenseful music) - How did they get... Look, I... What is, what is the sound they're making? It's different. What's it? We better make a run for it. They'll kill us. Move slowly. I don't think they're gonna harm us. You okay? Let's get outta here. Dr. Hummel said you can think. We believe it. - We've been covering the material but we haven't been able to decipher your language. - We'll keep trying. We'll keep trying. (exciting music) At various times during the long history of the Earth, when sudden change threatened the delicate balance of nature, nature always attempted to correct this imbalance by evolving new and higher forms of life which could adapt to the new threatening circumstances. The forms of life which could not adapt mercilessly were made extinct. Now, as never before in our long history, the Earth is being threatened by mankind. By ourselves. By our destruction of the environment and our pollution of the atmosphere. And, so once again, nature is reacting. This time attempting to defend itself against man's unrestrained tampering and the chosen instrument of this defense is this new species of killer bee created by some electronically stimulated genetic mutation. The late Dr. Hummel's research has given us ample evidence that this species has evolved beyond it's ordinary habitual and instinctual concerns and patterns and is capable of reasoning. Furthermore, this species has established meaningful and serious communication with my colleague, Mrs. Miller and myself. - Good lord, this chap's gone completely raging bonkers. - No sir. They have communicated a warning that unless we stop abusing their environment that they will eliminate mankind from it completely. - Thank you, Dr. Norman. That was a most interesting presentation. The committee will consider it for it's next agenda. - There's nothing to consider. This is an ultimatum. Either we share this world with them on their terms or we vanish as a species. - Please, Doctor. We've invited you here as a courtesy to the memory of the late Dr. Hummel. But, now we have important business. Would you mind - You're not listening to me. Would you kindly listen to me and try to understand what I'm telling you? Please believe me. - You have to listen. You have to listen what the bees have to say. (buzzing) - Sorry, Doctor, we have to have you removed from this room. Please, don't give any difficulties. Don't make any trouble. - You don't know what trouble is yet. - You fools, you idiots. Now you leave them no choice. (buzzing) (exciting music) - They won't harm you. Stay where you are. Now listen. There are approximately 20 trillion of these bees in existence. And, they're multiplying at a rate of five million a day. From now on, they will dominate the Earth equally with mankind or without mankind depending on whether or not we accept their terms. I know you will accept. There's no other way to survive.
