Phew. - Hi. - Hello. - Saw you were having trouble back there. - Yeah. - You lost? - No, just... broken down. - You need a lift? Sorry. Got my mess in here. - No, it's all right, I called the breakdown service. Don't have to stop but thanks. - All right. - Oh, here we go. - Will it be long? - No, thanks. - Will they be long? - No, they're on their way. - Well, there'll be traffic and all that, won't there?

Oh, shit. I don't have a signal. Must be out of range. - Yeah, I think we are. - But you got through. - Yeah. Weird. - Well that's great, listen, I can wait with you. I've been on the road for hours, I might catch a nap. - No, honestly, I'm fine. I'm absolutely fine. - I'll be back here if you need me, okay? - Okay. - I'm Paul, by the way. - Cool. Whatever to do. - Are they not coming then? - They're a bit backed up but they said they're on their way. Thanks for stopping though. - I could try them using your phone. I don't have a signal. Tell you what. How about I drive you to the nearest service station? I'll give you a tour. - What, the one back there? - Oh yeah. Private members thing or something. I thought you looked out of place. - I think I'll just wait here with the car. - But the next village, I'm sure there's one just up the road. - No, I'll wait here. I like it out here, it's peaceful. - Yeah, that's because everyone's using that new bypass. This is all dead now. Not safe, you being out here on your own. - Well, I think you're right. I'll-- - Sorry. - Wait in here until they come, thanks. - You all right? You don't look it. Chicken soup? - No. - Nope? Okay. - Can you hear me? Damn it! Fuck sake! - Sorry. - You fucking bastard! You're unbelievable! - I didn't know what you were doing. I'm really sorry. Listen, you've got the wrong impression. Earlier, in the car park, I was minding my own business. Wasn't sure if I should say anything to you. You seemed pretty spooked already. Creepy place, couldn't go in their myself. Not very friendly. And I know I probably freaked you out again but I just wanted to know that you were all right. I suppose you really haven't called the services out, have you? I'm up and down this road a lot. It's not safe. Maybe something's upset you and you get on the road to escape it and all you can see ahead of you is what you want to forget. Some people park up and leave the car to get on to a bridge and fling themselves off. It happens. I've seen it. You're not one of them suicidals, are you? Look, if you're even thinking about it, please don't do anything silly. If you need to speak to someone, you can speak to me. Tell Paul. Tell Paul. There's no one else here. - Okay. I called my boyfriend, he's on his way and he's really pissed off about my guitar. - You know what? I got us some help. Johnno. - Paul, mate, hey there. Yeah, you ready? Open it. - He says it's fixable but his tools aren't the right calibration for it. There's a workshop just along the road. - We're gonna push you up to the front of the ramp and I'll stick it straight in, take you wherever you wanna go. - Cool. - Comfy body work. Very cute. Boy is she nice. Big old rod. We'll take her out, open her right up. So? - So what? - Are you gonna take it off? Your brake. It's a bit stiff. You're not from around here, are you? Line her up. What you doing? Turn the break off. What you doing? Don't muck about, take the hand brake off. What's the matter? What, you're scared? What you scared of? I'll fucking scare you! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Whoa? Whoa? Whoa? What? What are you getting big with? What're you doing? You think you're fucking getting engaged? Ask when ready, yeah? This is what it fucking is, all right? This is what it is. If you're not up for it, fuck off back to your car and wank yourself off all day. Do whatever it is you do but stop doing it around us! At your fucking leaser. Move out the way! You! You, you cunt, open the door! Open the fucking door, you little whore! You're a fucking little whore! I'm gonna fucking kill you! I'm gonna fucking bang on the fucking wood! Come here, you cunt! You're a long fucking way from home! - What was all that about? He seemed all right and he was up for helping but you never can tell, can you? I think I should get going now. - He's coming. He's fucking coming! - Police. My car's broken down. I think someone's trying to get me. No, no, no, wait, wait, wait. There are two of them. One of them tried to run me off the road. Where the fuck am I? I'm somewhere off-- Fuck! - It's okay, he's gone now. Hello? I'm sorry, I didn't know he was a lunatic. It's cold out here, you'll catch your death. Don't wanna leave you like this. Can't let it happen again, not again. You know, when I was 10, coming home from the cost on the train, I saw a woman throw herself off a bridge. Didn't see her land but I knew that was it. Anyway, about a week later saw on the news. Body's been found. Stuck down the side of a cattle grate. It's your last chance for a lift. I don't wanna hear about you on the news. I'll never forgive myself. I'm going now. Stupid bitch. - Fuck! - Your distributor. The lane's damaged. - Isn't there anything you can do? - No. You're gonna need a replacement. - Okay. Thanks for telling me. - I've waited long enough. - Will you please leave me alone? Isn't there someone anywhere that's missing you? - Nope. - Well I've called the police and they're on their way. You fucking won't leave me alone! Please! No! No! No! No! No! - Scream again. I came over to help you. Instead of teasing you. - You're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - You're sorry? - I was just scared. I was just scared and I wasn't thinking straight and you're right, and you're right, you're right. I should've let you help me because I know you're kind actually. You're a kind man and you would've helped me and I should've just let you. Let's just forget about all of this and start again. And you can help me and I'll let you help me. And we don't need to do any of this and we can just be kind to each other. We can just be kind to each other. We can be tender. Because I know that you don't wanna do this. I know that you're not a bad man, really. You're soft. You are, you're soft. You're soft. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - It's okay. - I'm sorry. - Please! Please stop! - Wow, what a day, huh? Are you hungry? - No. - Got a cold burger here. Huh? Had an apple somewhere. Chicken soup? At least I think it's chicken. - I'm fine, thank you. - You like this one? - Yeah. - I don't, hold on. Yeah, this will do us. You all right back there? - Yep, I'm fine. - Don't look it. What's that? - Let me go, please. Please. - Please don't cry. Please stop crying, it upsets me. Guess what, I'm a doctor. You cold? Little bit of fucking heat-- That's funny. Wait, that's enough! I said that's enough! Bitch! Oh, fuck. Let go! Fucking let go, you little bitch! Fucking let go! - If you're just joining us, where have you been? Don't worry, you're here now and all sins are forgiven. We're just coming up to-- - You're joking. - You all right? What happened? Can you move? Don't move. Can you feel my hand? I'm Jules. - He... The car... - What? - He tried to kill me. - What? - He tried to kill me. - Hold on. - So, you feeling better now? Where's your car? You're in a bit of a mess, aren't you? You been drinking? - No. He tried to kill me. - You're not one of them suicides, are you? - Little bit shaken up. Looks like another stiff. Not making much sense. Could be a time waster. - So, what's his name? - I didn't get his name. - Look, if it's a domestic-- - It's not a domestic. How could it be a domestic out here? - I don't know, some people get a bit testy after a long drive. - I don't know who he was. I was travelling alone. - Decide what you wanna do then. We just need a few details-- - I was attacked. He tried to kidnap me and I fought him off. - Where did he pick you up? - My car is back down that way on a slip road. They must've moved it. - So you been up on a side road? - He followed me. He saw me at the truck stop. The one over that hill. - That's just trees, love. - Past the trees. I think they did something to my car. - They? - It's just over there. Why don't you go and take a look? - So you said you met them at a truck stop and they followed you to a slip road. - Then he got a bit rough, didn't want to pay you. - How dare you. - We'll drive around, shall we? Have a little look at your truck stop. Fuck. - There's places like this up and down the road. You sure this is the right one? - Yes. They use the lady's toilet as storage and there's loads of water on the floor of the gents. - There's always water on the floor. - Yeah but it aint water. - My guitar was stolen as well. - You reporting a theft now? - And there was a girl. I heard her voice. - Ah. Competition. - What? - Before I go in there and make a fool of myself, are you on drugs because your story keeps changing. - No, I'm clean! - You're wasting our time, you'll be arrested. - Do you recognise any of the trucks? - It happened. The man's car was parked right over there. That's it, that's the car. - Dispatch, I need a registration check. November, eight, four, five, delta, foxtrot. - All of the regulars in there. - He's one of them. - These places always attract parasites. Hanging around truck stops dressed like that doesn't help either, does it? - I say we just do her anyway, sarge. Nicole Reed, I'm arresting you for trespassing on a motorway and for wasting police time. - Hey! Just leave her alone, okay? You clean yourself up, grab a tea and stay off the road. - Well can I get a lift? - No. Call a cab. Go ahead. - Okay, let's go! Come on! Come on, little girl! Come out, come out, wherever you are! - Go back! - Run. Run. - Shit! - Run. - No! - It's okay. It's okay. It's all right. He should've just let you drive on. Now we're gonna have to clear the little prick's mess. Let's make it fun. Aye? It's better when it's fun. - Come on! - Can you let me in? - How can I help you? - Will you let me in? - Sorry, not allowed. Tell me what you want and I can. - He's trying to kill me! Will you let me in?! - My boss says people say that all the time. Now I can call the police for you. - No! No. Don't call the police. Will you just open the door, please? Please? Okay, look, call my mom. Her number is-- - Not allowed personal calls, sorry. - Will you help me, please? - There's nothing in here worth nicking. - Please! - I mean, I'm not saying you're a thief but, you know. - You fucking will let me in! Please! Please! Are you one of them? Will you fucking all leave me alone?! Don't come near me! Leave me alone! Leave me alone. I haven't done anything. - Let me in. No, no, no, no, no, no, please! Please, wait, no! No, stop! Please, you have to help me! Wait! Wait! Please! Stop!
