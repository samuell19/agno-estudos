And what's the problem here? - Well, Doctor, I was having lunch at the Derby, when somehow or other, this kooky little mutt- - Nurse, prepare the patient for examination. - You know, I don't know how, but well, she got into the car, and in a second or so, she was sitting right in the front seat next to me. - [Dr. Hackett] Name of patient, please. - Well, I call her Shaggy. - Next of kin. - Well, I guess it's me. - You got papers on this dog? - Oh, no, no. As I said, I was just leaving the Derby when she turned up. - This could get you in a lot of trouble. - Trouble? But she's just a nameless little mutt. Look, Doctor, the reason I brought her here is that, well, I have a kid who's writing me a lot of fan letters and he is just dying to have a dog. - I was reading in the medical journal about a case similar to this. A man picked up a dog who was an alien in the country illegally. Wound up in a lot of litigation. Finally took his house away. - Is that how the canary got an ulcer? - Huh? - Well, look, Doctor, all I want you to do is just examine her and make sure that she's all right. And I'll send the boy around to pick her up in the morning. Hmm? Oh, it's all right, honey. It's all right. You're going to have a good home. (Mooch barking) Look, I'll come and visit you. Now, how is that? (Mooch barks) Oh, now take it easy. Sweetheart, take it easy. I love you, but I can't keep you. Now, now, now you be a good girl, and I'll come see you real soon.

(Mooch barking) Be nice of nurses. And if the doctor says he knows you, give him a cold nose. (Mooch barking) (goat bleats) - Hi I'm Mr. Darren.

I guarantee if you do that, she'll be back on her perch singing better than ever. - Dr. Hackett, Mr. Darren. - Oh, yes. - Hi, Doc. - Hi, what's the problem here? - I found this dog this morning while I was down at the garage, and she just kind of attached herself. - Nurse, prepare the patient for examination. - She's a great dog. You know, I took her down to the beach and we spent the whole day together. - [Dr. Hackett] Name of patient, please. - [Mr. Darren] Oh, Sunshine. - Next of kin? - Well, I guess me. - I've seen this dog someplace before. I never forget a muzzle. Dog I'm referring to was brought in yesterday. Very sullen beast, morose, neurotic. - Oh, no, that couldn't be Sunshine. She's one of the happiest dogs I've ever seen. - Yeah, she looks pretty familiar to me. Of course, I wouldn't testify to it under oath. (chuckles) I remember a classmate made that mistake. Very famous case involving two St. Bernards, even the casks were identical. Picked the wrong one, ended his career, took to drink, horrible. - Yeah. Well, look, I was wondering, Doc, could I leave the dog here for a couple of weeks? You do take boarders, don't you? - Yeah, we have excellent facilities, round-the-clock care. - Nurse, send for the attendant. - Yes, Doctor. - Hey, hey, sweetheart. Don't take it so hard. Listen, hey, I'll be back in a couple weeks. (Mooch barking) - Attendant, take this patient to wing five, please. - Yes, sir. - You be a good girl, you hear? And I'll be back to get you just as soon as I'm through with the picture, all right? (indistinct) Take care, Doc. Thank you very much. - It's a pleasure. - Take care. Bye-bye. (door rumbling) (door slams) (dogs barking) (suspenseful music) - [Zsa Zsa] Oh, no, I had no idea he would leave you here. This is terrible. It's like the "Last Mile." (dogs barking) (suspenseful music) Mean old man. (dogs barking) (door slams) (dogs barking) Don't give up, Mooch. Keep on trying! (metal rattling) (dogs barking) You're doing it. You did it! The world is yours. The world really will be yours, darling if you can just get into that studio. (gentle music) (car whirring) That's it. This is where you really belong. "Rhett, as God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again." (gentle music continues) Underneath a lamppost by the village square. Guess who's coming to dinner? - [Man] Who?

Let's see your profile. Other side. That's it! That is your good side. Remind the cameraman. And be sure to tell him no close-ups after four o'clock. - [Mr. Albert] Really? - Oh, and the eyes!
