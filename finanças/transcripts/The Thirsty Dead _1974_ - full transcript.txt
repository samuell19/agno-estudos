(waves gently lapping) (eerie foreboding music) (sultry go-go music) (sailer whistling) (audience applauding) (sailer whistling) [Announcer] For the second time in less than 48 hours, a young woman has vanished from the streets of Manila. Ann Coleman, age 18, an American, was last seen leaving the Trinidad Hotel at 9:05 p.m.. Police are warning young women to stay off the streets unless they are properly escorted. The government is investigating the rumor that the abductions are the work of a Hong Kong-based white slave ring. For more details stay tuned to this station. How would you like to be a white slave, honey? Show me where to join. Yeah well just peel me a grape, and I might do it. (Knocking) [Sailor] Hey Claire, are you coming? Hold your horses sailer, I'm coming. [Sailor] I got a taxi ticking out here! Yeah I bet that's not all you got ticking out there. (door rattling) What are you doing, playing some kind of game? All right I told you that I'd be... (gasping) (eerie sinister music) (hypnotic suspenseful music) (sirens wailing) Did she have any boyfriends? Hundreds. Hundreds. Seven girls in a month, all young, attractive, no motive, no clues, no ransom notes, no bodies. But plenty of ulcers. Hey can I go, my leave was up an hour ago! The shore patrol's gonna be looking for me. Francisco, that's an either or, and I don't like either-ors. But it's true. Either we love each other, and get married, or not at all, it's that simple. Ha ha, you're not making any sense! You love someone and you want to marry them. You've married everybody that you loved. I only asked once before, and this is different. I know, I just don't want to be married. Not now. Not to me. Francisco, if I ever decide to get married, you're the only person I would even consider marrying. Laura, I uh... No no no pressure, it can happen in Tokyo, in Honolulu, San Francisco, Tuesday, Wednesday. But when I am ready, I'll holler. Francisco. And if I am not there? I'll cry a lot. (poignant music) (sighing) Goodnight. Pick me up at the airport on Tuesday, right? Bye. (suspenseful music) (muffled screaming) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (poignant music) (suspenseful music) (whimpering) (gasping) Oh... (whimpering) (rats squeaking) (groaning) (rats squeaking) (Laura moaning) (gasping) (rats squeaking) Oh! God you maniacs, oh! Oh, oh! [Bound Girl] What is this? Where are we? (sighs) I don't know. We mustn't let them know that we're afraid of them. (rats squeaking) (eerie tense music) (jungle birds cawing) There, hello. Hello. (panting) Do you know where we are? Beats me. How long have you been here? Since last night. This is Bonnie, Virgin Queen of the Acme Computer Company. I'm Claire. Laura. Ann. What do they want? I think we're getting a free ticket to Hong Kong. Don't say that! Honey, there are worse things! My aunt was a hooker, she had a great life, silk sheets, (mumbles) clothes, the works! No I wouldn't. Things could be worse honey. If you can make a buck and not even leave your bedroom, you've really got it... Oh my god look at that. Is this how white slavery starts, (chuckles)? (jungle birds singing) (tense music) (gasping) Uh! (machete whacking) Oh! Oh it's okay, I'm all right. It's okay, I'm fine! (suspenseful music) It's nothing, it's just a little cut, I'm fine. Nothing. (eerie suspenseful music) (helicopter droning) Here we are, oh oh oh please help us! We're over here, help us, please, please! Please help us! Stay away from me, no no don't touch me, leave me alone, I never hurt you... (muffled shouting) Let me go! (eerie suspenseful music) (jungle birds singing) (tense music) (suspenseful music) (jungle birds singing) (waves lapping) It's okay. (luxurious music) (foreboding music) Seek the guidance of Raoon. (eerie suspenseful music) (singing in foreign language) (tense music) Holy good Jesus. You're wanted in the inner chapel. (echoing flute music) You have made the preparations? All is ready. And you have been with them? Yes. [Priestess] She does bear the divine likeness? Yes, I've seen her at the bath with the others. There's a special quality about her. Raoon knows. And Raoon will decide. (giggling) (laughing) Ah! Ah, ah yes this is really beautiful. (women singing in foreign language) [Men] Raoon, Raoon, Raoon, Raoon, Raoon, Raoon, Raoon, Raoon, Raoon, Raoon, Raoon, Raoon, Raoon, Raoon! (eerie suspenseful music) Seed of our seed, father of our immortality, bring us the truth across the centuries! Has she been sent to us? What is her name, tell us her name! Laura! Laura! (eerie dramatic music) (water bubbling) Hey do you think they're eunuchs? Oh Claire. No I mean like you know, in the old days, - Come on! - When they used to take these guys and... (dramatically tense music) (rats squeaking) (gasping) (dramatic music) Somebody! (woman screaming) (whimpering echoing) Oh... Hi! (sighing) Wait Claire, wait! Mm. Mm. Seem fine. What have I got to to lose? You know these freaky folks have eyes for you. That's true, Laura. I picked up on that. Do you think that's good? [Laura] I don't know. The girl most likely to be sacrificed to a pagan god. Oh well, think of the honor of it honey. Claire! I don't mind. Mm, listen honey, I've been in worse situations than this. Now I don't know what these people want, but if anyone gives me a bed this comfortable, can't be all that bad. Hey listen I was only kidding about that human sacrifice. I'll just consider it an honor. (tense music) (frenetic music) Oh! Oh! (eerie echoing) (sinister music) Ah! (Dramatic music) Are you afraid? I am afraid. Only a fool would not fear the unfamiliar. [Laura] What are you going to do with me and my friends? Friends? It was understood that you were unknown to each other. You make friends quickly when you share a cell. (water dripping) Unlike most creatures, you need never be imprisoned. Do you mean I'm free to go? You will be free to choose. Who is she? Don't you know? I'm afraid I do. It's me. I painted it, some while ago. How? She was traced by my hand, an image out of my mind. Through Raoon I have seen you clearly, years before you came. I, I, I thought you were civilized? We are civilized, and that takes time. Stay with us, learn our ways. I'm not free to go? For the time, no. (poignant music) [Laura] Who is this for? [Servant] It is for you. [Laura] I don't understand. [Servant] It has been kept in readiness for a long time. Is it familiar? No. Why am I not with the other girls? It is your place now. (poignant music) (suspenseful music) (eerie dramatic music) (gasping) It's no use to shout, it will not save you from growing old like me. The curse of Raoon is on all of us, the price too much for anyone to pay. Go to sleep beautiful one. I was once like you, not many months ago. Remember, beware of Ranu, she will take it from you. Beware! Ranu. (eerie tense music) (singing in foreign language) Uh, I had the worst dreams last night. Me too. What's that strange singing? [Bonnie] They're devil worshipers, I've heard the legend. What are you talking about? I've heard the legends about these tribes in the jungle. Oh you're crazy. Well what was that pit we saw with all those bodies? And that scream we heard? And what's happened to Laura? She'll do all right for herself, I wouldn't worry about her, her kind always does. I thought my dreams were bad, being awake seems worse. (tense flute music) What does it mean? The woman represents Ranu, our High Priestess. The man is Raoon, her husband. He died 500 years ago. (tense flute music) May we go now? Of course. (poignant music) Is something wrong? Why were all those people staring at me? You are the guest of honor. And the girl in the blond wig, what does she mean? Legend. Oh. This place is frightening to me. It is strange to you. (laughs) Strange? It's completely different from my world. I can't remember being anywhere else. Really? That's strange, you seem so, uh... Civilized? Yes, civilized. Worldly. Sophisticated. I will take you to your quarters. (horn wailing) (horn wailing) Please put these on immediately. Where's Laura? You will see your friend soon enough. Quickly. I can't wear this! I don't think we have a choice. Put these on, they will come for you presently. Are you the... Drink. What is it? Drink! Pass it on. (tense music) (brooding music) She is among us. And you... Oh, how long we have all waited for this moment! Are you Ranu? Yes. I am Ranu. Somehow I expected someone older. (giggling) Did I say something wrong? You are very beautiful. Baru has told me so much about you. (horn wailing) We must go. (suspenseful music) (eerily tense music) (brooding music) Laura! Do not worry. Let the ceremony, begin! (suspenseful music) The people are paying tribute to Raoon! Raoon will keep us young forever. The leaf can heal all, and it's essence mixed with the blood of a young girl in her prime can produce an elixir, a potion that gives eternal life to the chosen. Raoon chooses the superior ones. The others must return to the Earth to be born again. That blood is precious to us, it is our celebration of life, it is our tribute to Raoon! It has been written that one would come, and lead us to a new way. Our long wait is over! And you have come to join us at last! Drink! Drink in eternal life! (eerie hypnotic music) I can't. Can't? You are not prepared? I don't wish to offend! I didn't ask to be brought here, I can't. The choice is not yours! You have been offered youth and beauty forever! All your needs will be taken care of here! People have sold their souls to the devil for less than that. Would I be any different, to drink the blood of my friend? To sap away her life so that I might live? Raoon chooses, it is the manner for all to serve! It's madness, it's insane! And what do you do with the chosen, with those honored few when you're finished with them? When their isn't a drop of blood left in them? You speak of matters you know nothing about! However, it may be good for you to see what does happen to those who are not chosen. It might change your mind! Baru! Have a word with her first, so the trip may not, prove necessary! Baru? Let me be with my friends! You will die with them! I hope not! No one can help you! Please Baru, let me be with my friends! It is not so simple Laura, you are part of a prophecy! No, you don't make sense! Life revolves toward the eternal. Nature builds and destroys in search of what can live forever. Please, come drink. Aww... Ah! (Laura screams) (dramatic music) (screaming) Let me go! Let me go! Oh! Oh! - Oh, let me go! - Do you want to see what happens to those people on the altars? Ones who are not blessed with this eternal life nonsense as you call it? No, no, no! Oh no! (eerie dramatic music) Oh no! Oh! (screaming) (screaming) Get her out! (Laura sobbing) (whips cracking) (Laura crying) (vulnerable music) I had to do it. I had to show you. Show me what? Sick, twisted bodies sucked dry? Laura, these people have fulfilled themselves. Their life force flows within us forever. That's their contribution. I want you to share in this with us. I want, I want you to know the joy of living forever without the fear of death. In God's name how can you find joy crippling and abusing people so that you can live? You don't understand, Laura! Oh I understand, I understand! Listen to me please! We have the wisdom of the ages Laura, that's part of our gift! And through Raoon we've evolved beyond nature. We've combined his wisdom with, with the vitality and beauty of youth! (sighs) Laura, don't you see, we must isolate the others! Our existence is the worship of beauty! Their presence, their ugliness would only be an intrusion! No, no Baru, can't you see? Look into yourself, worshiping yourself at the expense of others, that's ugliness! That's evil! Perhaps, in time, you will understand that our every action is guided by the divine wisdom of Raoon. No! You can't believe that! I know this. The community that survives, does so by the light of superior people. We are they. (sighing) The chosen. I want to see Ranu. If I am not free to go home, I do not choose your eternal youth. I only want to ask you one thing. Let me be with my friends! I can not give you what you want, I will not join you. I may be your victim, I may be your prisoner, but I will never join you, never! (laughing) (smacking) You leave her alone! Guards! (crying) No! Jesus in Heaven, give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses... Would you cut out that religious mumbo-jumbo? [Ann] Leave her alone, it helps her. I don't want any crap from you, Miss Teenage America! What do you think happened to Laura? Oh, well you saw her, she has clothes and she has Prince Charming, I just wouldn't worry about her at all. Oh (sighs)! [Ann] Are you all right? Oh, oh, it's okay. It's all right. What about you? What did they do to you? It's all right, it's all right, those leaves that they put on it stopped the bleeding. It, it felt a little funny when they did it, but it just feels strange now. We've got to get out of here! Why didn't they do it to you? They want me to join them. They claim they live forever. [Claire] Why you? (sighing) There's this old painting, it looks like me. They, they mix the blood with some sort of a potion or something. Listen, do you think they'd like to have me instead? Claire, you haven't heard one word I'm saying. This place is evil, it's voodoo here. We have to get out of here. But how? (sighing) I don't know. This whole place is just a maze, passageways... [Servant] There is a way. You will help us? You are not afraid? Anything's better than this. Than come with me. There are many passageways, many. Wait a minute, wait a minute! I don't think I want to leave. Oh good god Claire! [Claire] I'm very comfortable here. You may be comfortable here, but you will also die. Please go home with us! All right, all right, the story of my life, one-night stands. There, I can go no farther. [Laura] But you must go with us. No, they have made me too old, after a time. Go towards the leaves, away from the mountains. Thank you Eva. (poignant music) (eerie tense music) (jungle birds singing) Oh girls come on let's go! Laura, if I'm not crazy. We've been by this spot before. Are you sure? No I'm not sure, everything looks alike. We should have stayed back there. Oh, you're not gonna feel that way when they catch up with us. Come on, come on. Mother, somebody, somebody please help me! Please, help! Help me please, help! Please, help me please, help me please... Just be quiet Bonnie, just sit there. Don't move. (jungle birds singing) (sighing) How did you know that snake was gonna go away? I didn't. It was either that, or you taking it off of her foot. Sweetie, you're all right, come on we've got to keep going. One cool chic. What do you think? I don't know. What have we got to lose? You're learning kid, you're learning. (whispering) Bella! (speaking foreign language) Bonnie, do you understand what they're saying? No, I've never heard that dialect before. Do you know the way to Manila? Ma-ni-la? (speaking foreign language) Uh, I think she's telling us to get some rest. Good idea. (tense music) Whoo, I feel like I slept for weeks. (crickets chirping) Hey is it the next day or what? [Ann] Oh no! Ann what is it? It's okay, it's okay. Lie back, lie back, relax, relax. Help! Somebody help! Help! It's okay, it's okay. She's gonna go get help, gonna get help. She can help, it'll be all right (mumbles). (eerie dramatic music) (singing in foreign language) My impulse, was to let you escape. Maybe I should have. But you couldn't. No. I'm wondering, why I can run to someone once, my arms outstretched, all smiles, yearning, giving, wanting, laughing. Now I don't know what I feel or if I feel, I'm, I'm dust. Laura, oh Laura! You're being romantic. There's a fine old word. What a time. Yes, I know. Hala, why are we going through here? I've been told to take them through Orlic. (mysterious music) (squeaking pulley) (dramatic music) Oh, Eva! Release her! Take her down! Ranu will hear of this! Quickly! (rats squeaking) Oh! I knew nothing of this, I swear it! She's dead! (sobbing) She was 28. She was brought here five years ago. Take the ladies back to their quarters. Now! (sobbing) Laura, listen to me! (crying out) After today (mumbles) and I will be banished. It's too late for me but not for you and the others. I will help you, come, there's not much time! Doesn't he know he's giving away his life, his immortality? Fetch me the guards. Bring them to me in my chamber! You're wanted in the observatory at once. I'll remain here until your replacements arrive. Go! (eerie tense music) You're free! You're free! Yeah well how do you know we'll get away with it? I don't want to end up like that old hag getting eaten up by rats! Claire, you can't stay here. Why not? I want to live forever! I think you're nuts to turn it down. Oh I'm pretty, and I've got a good body, they'll take me. I'm staying and you're not gonna screw it up for me! You're not going anywhere! Get out of my way! All my life people have been telling me what to do! Get away! (Clattering) (ominous tense music) Claire! Claire! No! You stay away from me! (clattering) (screaming) (dramatic music) (rats squeaking) We must go. Come. (dramatic music) (pottery breaking) (screaming) (ripping) (eerie tense music) Laura, tie this around your waist. Well be going down the back way. It's very dangerous, but we have no other choice. (jungle birds singing) (screaming) Come on, let's go! (shouting) (screaming) (dramatic music) (shouting) (whips smacking) (screaming) It will be morning soon, we must take advantage of the darkness. Quickly! (whip smacking) Baru can not get beyond the Ring of Age, but we must stop the others. Go, quickly, go find them and bring them back! But do not go beyond the Ring of Age! If you must, guards, you go on from there! Go! (jungle birds singing) (eerie tense music) (coughing) (gasping) Ba, (groans), Baru! Please don't go on! Please no more, I can't go on (sobs). (panting) All right. Wait here, wait here. Here, quickly! (coughing) (sighing) (eerie tense music) (screaming) Ann, Ann, no sh! Sh, sh-sh, it's all right! (sobbing) It's all right, it's all right, sh, sh, it's all right, (weeping) there's no danger, (weeping) it's all right, sh! (groaning) We must go on now. Oh Baru we can't! We can't, we're tired! I know but there's only one way through the jungle and the others know it as well as I. Now our only chance is to keep ahead of them. Please, we must go on! Come on. Come on. (eerie tense music) (dramatic music) (jungle birds singing) (eerie tense music) Baru, Baru! Baru what is it? We must go on. (eerie tense music) (thumping) (dramatic music) We have passed the Ring of Age. It will come quickly now. Is there anything I can do? It's too late. Do not hold on to me, I will not hold on to you. (eerie music) No... No! Oh, no! (poignant music) I can't stand to see you suffer! It is my punishment. And my reward. (eerie tense music) Come, as far as we can go. (poignant music) (eerie tense music) No, no sadness. I have escaped. Now you must leave me before it is too late. No! What will they do to you when they find you? They won't find me, dear one. (eerie music) Go now! Please! Please, go! (dramatic music) (jungle birds singing) (eerie music) Kill me, please! Kill me. (thumping) (snapping) (poignant music) (brooding music) I can't go on any more! No more (sobs)! (motor revving faintly) Listen! (dramatic music) (yelling) (speaking foreign language) (dramatic fast music) (helicopter droning) You men, you men get out of that ravine! Get them out of that place! Uh, listen Miss. I don't really know what happened to you girls, but there's no way up or down from that mountain. N-No we were up there... Not only that, you go 50 feet right now, [Pilot] Helicopter to ground, - helicopter to ground! - And you get chewed up by poisonous snakes. They're crawling all over the place. Colonel Tyler! If this is the mountain she's telling us about, there's absolutely nothing down there. [Lieutenant] Okay then, you better come down now. Sorry Miss, there's nothing there. (dramatic music) I was there! I was. (remorseful music) (funky energetic music)
