Fuck! Eylül! Finally. I was worried sick. You didn't answer your phone. I called all night. Hello? I am talking to you. Missy, are you there? Yes! Yesterday, we didn't get to talk. You were so busy... But I've handled it so far. Now, you should say something. Oh, you think so, huh? What should I say? It's all ready. They've been waiting for a response for a month. Volkan made the deal with the channel. By the way he's madly in love with you. You should say something. What will it be? After thinking for a month, you've come up with this? Listen to me. We'll have fun. We'll travel all around the globe. A dream job! -A small September affair. -Come again? Name of the show. Yeah, small. -So you'll agree? -Already did. I called them last night. -Dude, are you serious? -Never. First let's go to Peru. Meet some handsome Aztec boys. -Then to Rome... -Enough talking for now. I'm going to the channel with Atıl. Meet you there? -Yeah, okay. -Daddy is calling. -Daddy. -Are you home, honey? Yes. Mommy wants to see you. Let's have dinner. So, only mom wants to see me, not you? No way. I want it more than her. Okay, then. You start ordering the appetizers. Today, I feel like a lead actress in my own movie. They are rolling the credits and I start a new life. Girl, we've missed you. This is on me. Hey, Mom, look who it is? Oh, excuse me? Can we take a selfie, please? Of course. Oh, isn't that Atıl? Excuse me. Can I take a photo with you, too? -Yes, sure. -Take it, please. Wow, look! He's better looking in real life. -Do you want something? -Yes, you. -Did I do something wrong? -Yes. Very wrong. What did I do wrong this time? You fell in love with me. You didn't with me? I am too cheerful to fall in love. -Are you okay? -Yeah, I'm okay. -Today is a perfect day. -That's the spirit. Welcome back, Eylül. Today, I have everything. Today, everybody loves me. Today is the first day of my wonderful, perfect and unique life. Eylül. Yes, Daddy? Where are we? Help me with this. When they brought me to the hospital, my heart stopped beating. Then... I couldn't recover for a week. They sent me to a private hospital. -Is she conscious? -No. One day, when Mom came out of the bathroom... After all that money, look at the toilet paper they gave you. I'm starving, can we order? Engin! Engin, she woke up! Engin, she'll fall! Engin, run! The following two days, totally conscious, I did some funny things. You funny boy! Honey, you had an accident. But don't worry. It's all right now. You are fine now. That's what they said. Yeah. I believed them. -You can't look. -Miss Eylül! -Are those mine? -Yep. Is that your professional opinion? -Everything is fine. -I've not gone mad, right? I don't think so. Can I ask some questions? Sure. Go on. -How old are you? -24. I see. You see what? My age? I'm 27. Your marital status? Single. But not because I can't find anyone. -Job? -I work at a production company. She'll have her own show now. A Small September Affair. Hey, I didn't accept it yet. And you came up with a name already! Do you remember the accident? Do you remember what you were last wearing? A coral colored top. And denim shorts with it. Nope, white shorts. White shorts. Do you remember where you were? I was in, like, a seaside town. Like an old village, with coffee shops under the trees and stuff. You were there, too. We were together. And where is that place? Remember that place we went to? For Atıl's commercial. Well... Bozcaada! We'd just arrived there. Well... We just sat for a quick cigarette break. We had an accident there? Tell me, Berrak! That was one month before the accident. You remember the time before the accident. What? No way! You know... I mean... I don't remember the rest. I don't remember my last month. -Easy, calm down. -You want me to calm down? How many times did you die? How do you know? -When did we come back? -We were there for the weekend. -I had a shoot. -Calm down. We went for the weekend. Stayed and came back. The rest is the same. Everything was the same. Really. So, nothing you're not telling me? How could we hide it from you? You'd find out eventually. Yeah, I would. I'll beat the shit out of you. -I'll start with you. -Okay. Don't worry. Your memory will be back soon. It will, right? -Yeah, of course. -It will. Yeah. -So, I am fine? -Everything is fine. Feel better soon. I stayed in the hospital for one more week. One nurse I yelled at, two doctors I flirted with, three times I was bored. Then I signed some stuff and took my life back from where I left it. Everybody kept telling me I was fine. And eventually I believed them. Eylül, since you are standing, grab me a beer. Sure. I'll get it. What's wrong with you? Guys, Eylül is bringing me a beer. Wow! Grab me one, too! A glass of wine for me! Bring the ashtray and some wine, too. -What else? Want me to open your beer? -Yeah, open it. Eylül. Eylül? Eylül! Eylül! Let me go! Calm down! I have to figure it out! I have to solve it! -Calm down! -Let me go! -Eylül, calm down! -I have to go! -Okay! -I have to go! -Eylül! Calm down! -Let me go! -Eylül, calm down! -Guys, go back, it's okay! -Eylül! -Let me go! -Calm down! -Eylül! It's alright. It's alright. We're here. Look at me! Did Berrak say anything? -It was a secret. -It's fine. Poor girl, she couldn't recover. Should we go? -Berrak, what's happening to me? -Nothing, honey, it's fine. -What's happening? -You're confused. I have to go somewhere. Where? I don't know. -The coffee is ready. -Come. Eylül, it's going to be alright. This is normal. You came back from the dead. We are with you. I am here for you. Everything is alright now. -It is, right? -It is. Everything is fine, Eylül. Everyone is okay. If everyone is okay, why do you feel like something is missing? Missing. The sugar is missing here. No, seriously. No sugar in this. And here is Eylül! Let me. -Get me some cookies, too. -Yes, ma'am. Berrak. I realized something weird the other day. What? No messages on my phone for the last month. -So? -A whole month. Nobody texting me? Because you'd lost your phone at that time. The battery ran out and they got erased or somebody did it or something like that... The phone was lost. -That's my phone, by the way. -August 4th: "Eylül, are you okay?" Give it back. August 7th: "Eylül, come back, it's not funny". Don't read please. August 30th: "Don't be scared. We're coming. Get out of that house." -Eylül. -Which house? One day before the accident. Which house? -We're fine. -Which house? -It's okay now. We are fine. -We're not fine! We're not fine at all! What happened to me? Which house? Tell me! Where was I? Tell me the truth, Berrak. -Tell me the truth. -In Bozcaada. -Why? -I don't know. You wanted to stay. -With whom? -Nobody. You were drunk, at a bar. You said come and get me. So, I texted "Okay, we are coming." That's it. Then we were back. -I didn't meet anyone there? -No, you didn't. Did I stay here for a month, huh? It looks like shit from above. -Where is the airport? It's all water. -This is a seaplane. Eylül, fuck you and your friendship! Fuck my life, too! Don't disturb the balance of the plane! So I came to this funny island with Berrak by my side. They are hiding something from me. But I don't know what. Our hotel is after this turn. Hotel Gelincik. -I am so dirty. -Dibs. First me. Number one. Okay, fine. But I'm freezing. Hurry up. That face... What happened? -I need some toothpaste. You go. -What? I'll buy some toothpaste. You go. Okay, fine. Hulusi. How do we know each other? Why was I here for a month? Hello. Do I know you? It's me. Tek. I can't remember. What do you want? -Are you kidding me? -What do you mean? -Come, let's go home. -What home? What home? -Eylül. -How do you know my name? -What, you don't remember? -Remember what? Remember what? That you're in love with me. My name is Tek. I was living on an island by myself. I was making a living by drawing. But a month ago, something happened. -I'll take another. -Sure. Tek! What is this? My eyebrows don't look like this. Don't worry. I'll handle it. They'll come down, when the paint dries. They better. Whatever you do, just fix it. -Berrak! -Yes, sweetie? Coffee, tea, cigarette... Something? -Fine. -Let's sit. -See you later, ladies. We'll come later. -Okay. My head is killing me. What a windy day! I'm going back to the hotel. I'm so tired. -I'll rest. I'll call you when I'm up. -Call me. -I'll take your bag to the hotel. -Thank you. Bye, dear! No! Are you reading a newspaper on vacation? -No, I'm not reading a newspaper. -What are you doing then? Weekly cartoons. Remember Deli Dumrul? The old man living on an island. A thick skinned one. He always says "Don't worry, we'll handle it." -Who draws that? -Tekin something. My idol. -The guy I'll marry. -Oh, my god! -There. -Let me see. Hello, my name is Tek. Tek, as in Tekin. Those cartoons, yes, I draw them. You say we should get married. Don't worry, we'll handle it. -Ordering some coffee? -Yeah. -Are you buying them? -Yes, I am. What is famous coffee? -Coffee with eggplant? -Yes, two please. Hello? Berrak? You left me for two minutes and you won't believe what happened. I almost got kidnapped. They wanted your number for ransom. I didn't give it, of course. Can you listen to me for a second? Berrak? Give it a short ad break! Don't yell at me, Atıl. What was I supposed to do? If it weren't for me, she'd have come alone. No, she doesn't remember anything. No, we're not going to Tek. We'll have some cake and come back. Don't worry. I'll be with her all the time. -I'm telling you, don't worry. -I'm here. She's here. I have to go. Bye. -What's up? -Atıl called me. -What's he saying? -The usual. What did you do? Remember anything? Come, Hulusi, come, my boy. Come here. She doesn't remember me. My fault! Stupid me. I wish I hadn't introduced you to each other. The sign was fine. Why bother? It was fine but not perfect. I want it to be perfect. Okay, whatever you say. It won't work. Gawking from far away won't work. Go make sand castles or something. Tek, you are a smart dude. But you know nothing about relationships. Then go chat with your parents. Tek, do you know what you need? -Another face? -A matchmaker kid. No, don't! Gülah! Gülah is my best friend on the island. She sells hats at the beach, gives a lot of advice and brings me a lot of trouble. A gentleman sent you this. He said... It'll protect you from the sun. Who is this gentleman? And? She asks if you know a good place for dinner. Well, she can go to the Battı Balık. It's a nice place. No, she says "take me to that place". -She said that? -Go ask her yourself. Ugly people do weird things just to be noticed by the beautiful people. We're so used to being invisible that... ...with only one look, an ugly person can fall in love with whoever notices him. Come on! Berrak? Who is Tek? -What? -Tek. I remember a name. Weird t-shirts, hands covered in paint... Oh, you are talking about that painter guy. What about him? Who is he? No one, nobody. Let me tell you. We came here. It was the second day. We went to the beach, chatting... Then a little girl showed up. A gentleman sent you this. He said... What did he say? It can't make you look more beautiful, but... -But? -It'll protect you from the sun. Nice point. Who is this poet? Really? -Could you give him a message from me? -What is it? Does he know a good place for dinner? -What are you talking about? -We have an unexpected guest. -Eylül, what have you done? -I'm bored on this bare island. We'll have fun. I'll hold his hand and he'll be happy. -It'll be fun. We'll laugh. -Girl, you are so bad. Remember? But... I have a feeling inside. What kind of feeling? A different one. Fun. If it were that fun, dear Eylül, why are they so afraid of you remembering it? -I'll go get some cigarettes. -Stop, we can order them. I'll be quick. Is there a place called Kaçtı Balık here? -You mean Battı Balık? There. -Thanks. I had an accident. See? I don't remember you. The day we were going to meet here, I came here early, made some preparations. Can I have a lighter? What kind of preparations? No, Mom. I'm not home. I'm calling you to let you know. I'll meet a friend and have dinner. Yes, a lady friend. Well, she saw my artwork and wanted to meet. Okay, well. I'll let you know if we have a connection. Okay. I'll ask if she speaks any foreign languages. I have to go. Bye. Okay, bye. Lots of kisses. Of course not. But I am kissing you anyways. Mom. She is very pretty. -Here, thank you. -You're welcome. Mom, there is this one thing. I'm scared. Because I'm not like them. The smell of fish on my hands won't wash away. My armpits sweat quicker than theirs. I am exposed, Mom. That's why I am scared. Emine, did you put nettle in this? -I did. -You did. Where's my wine? -Here. -Did you cool it in cold water? Yes, I did that, too. Tek. I am here, with you. Look, everything is amazing. Okay? -Don't worry. We'll handle it. -Yes, we will. Tek, can I have my hand back? She's here. I'm scared, Mom. Because this girl here, she'll be sure to break my heart. And she'll forget me. Oh, good. Somebody else is coming. I was scared you'd be alone. Today is our last night here. The guys are having a beach party. I told them about the date. They insisted, I couldn't ditch them. -Is it gonna be a problem? -No. These look amazing. I'm out. Bye. But all I was thinking about was that... She kissed me. I'm sorry. Did you remember? Don't worry. We'll handle it. Don't answer it. Please, don't. -Hello? -Eylül, where are you? -You've gone for cigarettes for forever. -I'm at Yandı Balık. Not Yandı Balık, idiot! Battı Balık. Are you alone? -I am with Tek. -No. -Eylül, walk away, now. -Why? -Eylül, get out of there. -We're just talking. Eylül, do as I say. Walk away and come to me. -Why? Why? Tell me what happened! -Don't listen to them. -Not yet. -Don't come closer. Don't. Something bad happened here, right? -Yes, sweetie. -What? What happened? The last day... On your last day here, you called us and said something. -Do you remember? -No. Try to remember. What did you tell me? What did I tell you? You said "Berrak, I'm scared. Come pick me up." I'm scared. I'm scared. Did he do something to me? -Did he? -Did you leave there? Berrak. Berrak, come get me. Come and get me out of here. Okay, I'm coming. Eylül, stop. Wait! Eylül! Go! Is there anybody? Anybody? Help me! Anybody? Don't come closer! Eylül, it's me. Do I ever harm you? Stay away from me! Go away! I'm Tek. Stay away from me. Don't come closer. Eylül, you know me better than anybody. -Don't you remember? -You did something bad to me. Leave me be. Please go away. Please. Make a fist. Make a fist with your hand. Eylül! Berrak! Please... Remember me. Why? Why should I remember? Because those memories aren't just yours. Eylül! It's okay, honey. Berrak, what did that guy do to me? Don't think about it. Just sleep and rest. We'll talk tomorrow, okay? I didn't stay at Battı Balık that night. I went to the beach with you guys. What do you mean? Do you remember? Tek told me. Then? Then, it was morning. We packed, ready to go. Eylül! Don't fool around, come on. -We'll pick up Eylül. -Okay. Eylül! The shuttle's leaving. We're waiting for you. You guys go. I'll stay here. What the heck? I'm not coming with you. What do you mean? Why? -Is there somebody else? -What? I'm bored. -You're bored. Bored of what? -Of us. If you're bored, why did you come here with me? Eylül, don't laugh. It's not funny. He kept crying and begging the whole time. It was horrible. I'm not laughing at it. What are you laughing at? Because finally I begin to remember. Eylül! Aunt Özcan prepared jams for breakfast. Özcan isn't a female name. Who is Özcan? Tek knows where she is. He can take you. I'm waiting at the coffee shop. Okay, calm down. Don't do it, Eylül. It's best to forget some things. Give up, before it's too late. It's dangerous to remember some things. Don't, you little fool! Okay. Don't know you. Don't trust you. Do anything wrong and I'll punch you. -Punch me? -I know kickboxing. What happened to me the day before I went to Istanbul? Okay. I'll tell you on one condition. I'll tell everything chronologically. Starting from the first day. Or I won't. You have 24 hours. Can we have two glasses of tea? Start. Waiter. Waiter! That isn't a waiter! What is this, a child labor? I ordered tea. -It's coming. -It's been half an hour. First things first. Don't like jam. Don't eat eggs. White bread, never. -Come. -Where? Corn poppy, mint. I don't know this. Spartium, good. Grape, strawberry, pear... Blanket, shoes... -They made jams out of everything. -Yes. Why? Tomato. Tomato. This is really good. Close the veils. Let nobody in. -You have a mark on you. What did... -Bee. Bee! What's happening? That day you stayed away from me. You were about to leave. You came to say goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye? -There's the grape harvest. -A great what? Us, the islanders gather around. Pick grapes and stuff. It's a once a year thing. Then, you... Well... You can't. You can't leave today. Don't leave. I'm leaving. Don't make me eat anymore. There are windmills on the island. Anybody who watches the sunset there, would never be afraid of death again. -Says who? -Sübye Mehmet. He's a good fisherman. Half crazy. -This is the last one. -Okay. Bon appétit. With eggplant. Okay. -Tea? -No, coffee. Two cups of coffee. Tek! Come, it's great over here. No, it's fine here. Come. Let's take a photo. I'll share it on Instagram. Come. Come. Take a seat. Take a seat. You take it. I want the car in it, too. Everywhere. You need to look at here. Hey, what are you doing? Give me back my phone. Give it back. It's my phone. Do the frame. Come on. Doing the frame. Okay. Now, close one eye and close the aperture a bit. I do what? Close one eye and close the aperture a bit. Okay. Take the photo and close your eyes. Eyes closed, develop the photo. -How? -Remember. That's enough! Enough! You're lying. Tell me the truth. -I am. -Tell me the truth. I am! I wouldn't do any of the things you said. -I wouldn't hold your hand at sunset. -I'm not lying. Look at me and look at yourself, Tek! -I wouldn't be with someone like you. -But you were. You held my hand. -You chose me. -Why would I choose you? I don't know. If I knew what I did, I'd do it again. I wish I knew if it was something I said, or did. I don't know how I'll sound, how I'll look. Eylül. I don't know how to repeat a miracle. Maybe nothing happened at that time. Maybe it was all in your head. Don't answer it. Let's go to one last place. Please. Atıl, take the car and come here, quick. Something happened to her? I don't know where she is. Her phone is off. Berrak? Atıl, what have I done? Why did I bring her here? We flew kites one day... You don't believe him, Eylül. -I was thinking about it. -Then, why are you listening? Because you pity him? The one I gave to you... Or are you starting to like his story and the girl in that story? You came to the coffee shop without a bag. "I want to go to the sea," you said. I said, "Don't worry, we'll handle it." -Where are we? -You wanted to go to the sea. This is nothing special. Wait a minute. Wait. Everywhere is filled with thorns. Easy. -You want to bet? -Oh, I love bets. Can you stop talking for two hours? -That's not a bet. That's torture. -Then I win. No way. You don't even talk to me. It's your nature. I'm not like that. -I make money by talking. -I won. You won shit. The bet hasn't even started. I'll get wild when I don't talk. You don't want it. -I won! -I can't stop talking. But... If I win... -...tonight you go out with me... -Okay. ...to dance. THIS PLACE IS GREAT I don't want to. -You don't know how to swim, right? -I don't have a swimsuit. You live on an island, but don't know how to swim? You don't talk to people, go out and mingle with crowds. -You don't dance. You don't swim. -I'm fine like this. Really? So you don't want to go and see the world, huh? You don't want to get drunk, dance and sing aloud or anything? Don't you want to live a little? It's not up to wanting, Eylül. Not everyone is lucky like you! -Don't give me that poor boy crap. -Yes, I'm scared, okay? I'm scared of all of that! I'm scared! Are you done now? Come. -Eylül, I can't. -You don't have to do anything. Just follow me. Eylül. Trust me. Come. Eylül. Don't worry. I'm here. I'll hold you. Come. -I'll go back. -Stop. Don't you want to come closer? Huh? Come to me. I'll hold you. Don't be scared. Come. I did it. -Nothing to be afraid of, right? -There's much to be afraid of. But I'm not afraid anymore. Do you remember? You were complaining. That I have allergies, that I don't know how to dance or sing. Eylül, I'm Tek. Please remember me. When we got out of the sea... ...you drew something. I said the waves would erase it. Eylül? This will be lost. No, it won't be. The waves will take it. And bring it to the shores of wherever you go. TEK LOVES EYLÜL Tek! Eylül. I've missed you so much. I only remember that day. -We don't have much time left. -Left for what? The day after... I remember. Come on, shake your ass a little. You are a dreamer. Tell me the truth, you dreamed about this, didn't you? I did, but... If you could see the man in my dreams... -Then? -You'd fall for him hard. Close your eyes. -Eylül, please. -Close them. Dance with me in your head. -How? -Like this. One day, an ugly man fell in love with a pretty girl. And the pretty girl started to play with him. Am I doing it? Yes, you are. Great! The girl treated the man the way she always does. She held him and then left him. Tortured him a little, and then called him back. Made fun of him, but still had him by her side. You know what? Do you have a spare bed in your house? Yes. This girl, who doesn't know love, who doesn't believe in love, was on her way to this ugly man's heart. -Is this place yours? -No, my mother's. Of course! -You make these? -Yep. What are these? Where do you find them? Drift wood. I collect it from the sea. Norman, who is that? Your mother? -Who? -That one. -Oh, no. That's me. -That's you? These don't hit your head? -Well... -Huh? -Can I get you a drink? -Can you get me a drink? You can. Get me a drink. -Cheers. -Cheers. Is this some sort of torture device from the middle ages? -What is this? -Torture device? No. They make yarn from wool with that. -Do you have wool to make some? -Look. Look, this is my bath tub. I take a shower here. Well, no one will see. This is the place I make my drift wood. This is, um, my bathroom. -This is my bed. -Your bed? Yes, my bed. -And is this the place to bring the girls? -Don't... It is you! You are Deli Dumrul! So, you were the guy I'd marry? Oh, the things I dreamed of... I didn't mean it that way. A SMALL SEPTEMBER AFFAIR THAT I CAN'T HANDLE Eylül, go home, now. If you don't go now, you'll never want to leave. Hello. Here, take it. -Draw me. -Why? I want to see what you see. I remember. I'm trying to answer a question about something I have no clue of. -Why tomatoes, peppers and eggplants? -Well... Here, have some. I'm confused. I'm messed up. Nobody is stopping me. I'm going somewhere I've never been. There is everything... Did you see his mouth? His nose? What are you doing? Looking at you. Others tell us who we are. I'm listening to my best story from a guy trapped on an island. Osman. Off-side Osman. Tell me! For God's sake! Couldn't I score this time either? This wasn't a goal, huh? -Is it a goal? -Goal. This wasn't a goal, huh? -Eylül, confess. You've missed me a lot. -Well, I... Eylül? Hello, Eylül? -Hello? -Oh! -Hello? Berrak? -Eylül. -Eylül, is this you? -Of course it's me, idiot. -I thought I heard someone. -I was sleeping. You woke me up. Oh, shoot. Sorry. What's up? Who are you with? Are you outside? -Well... -Who is it? Who could it be, Berrak? For God's sake! There is no one else. No one! Come back, then. It's been a long time. Sweetie, I've drunk too much. I'm gonna sleep now and call you later. Okay? -And then buy tickets. -Okay, I'll come. -I'm worried. -Okay. I just... I just wanted the phone to mute it. I'd better work now. Tek? Tek? Look, a star is falling. Look. Make a wish. I did. You want me to tell it? -I did, too. -What did you wish for? What did I wish for? Like... I wish to be someone else. Like someone... Someone tough and handsome. When you look at him, the world should stop. Someone to speak up and say what he feels right away. Someone to be mad at you. "I'm nobody but Tekin Bulut," he'd say. Someone that can grab you by your hand and pull you in. That can say, "I don't want you to go. I'm not letting you go. Now I've found you, I won't let you go." But I'm not like that, Eylül. Whatever I do... ...I'm only me. I want the guy with paint on his hands. I want you. I was very happy here. What else? But I can't stop, Tek. If I stopped, I'd drown. But... I stopped with you without drowning. -Like... -Like what? Love... Is this love? It can't be, right? I mean love... It's like... If you're asking this, then it's not. But it doesn't matter, right? It doesn't matter. We have so much time, right? Of course we have. You'll cook for me so much more. I will. And I'll be a pain in your neck for a long time. Eylül! Don't go anywhere. Come, guys. I'll introduce you to someone. Where are you going? -Come home. -You'll be there, right? I'll be waiting for you. Actually, nothing bad happens at the end of the story, right? Eylül! Eylül, I was so scared! You misunderstood. Come, let's go to Tek. You can't go. You can't. Tek told me everything. I remember. -Everything? -Yeah. Everything. You don't get it. I had a great month here. And the last night. Nothing bad happened. It was dreamy. -Then? Do you remember the morning? -No need to remember it. -Everything is fine. -No, it's not. Everything is not fine. Eylül, please try to remember. I don't want to. Everything is fine. I don't want to remember. -Everything is fine. -Eylül. Nothing bad happened. The master of mean love, Eylül, who loves life more than people, finally gave in. -Where to? -I'll make breakfast. You? For me? What happened? You can't believe it? I'll make you such a great breakfast that the whole town will be after it. They'll gather around you as if they were your followers. You'll see. Nothing bad happened. That was the happiest day of my life. I remember now. How I was scared, looking at this girl in the mirror, and how that fear was stronger than love. I remember. Hello, Eylül. Hello, Berrak. Could you come and get me out of here? Eylül, where are you? Are you all right? Eylül. I'm not. I'm scared. I'm scared. I ran away. I ran away! I just left Tek like that. I went back to the hotel. Then we arrived. You said there was some guy. "Some guy is hitting on me," I said. "I'm scared of him," I said. We were going back in the morning. All three of us went to a bar. Eylül, please remember. I didn't like this. I don't want to remember anymore. Come on! Guys, we have one night. So, have fun as if we had two. -Five, come on! -Man, she was bored as fuck. Then, tomorrow we'll have the boat. Visit all the coves around the area. Then go back. That's a great idea. Let's do it. -Hello. -Hello. You forgot this. Berrak, Atıl... -Tek. -Hey, man. Hey. Are you on vacation? How long has it been? Eight years. He lives here. Maybe Eylül will come often. I don't think so. Some assholes here hit on her right away. -They won't see her here again. -Maybe she'll come back for me. She is my girlfriend. Tek is the funniest guy here. -Obviously. -Yes, sure. What do you do, man? I'm a painter. I paint signs. A sign painter. How did you meet this lunatic? I looked at her... ...and I fell for her. Then I asked her out for dinner. She ditched me. I ate alone. I couldn't swim. She taught me how. I couldn't dance. She told me to dance. So I did. Then she came home with me. We cooked, made wine. Looked at each other without a word. We forgot about the rest of the world. It was just us. We made love. We fell in love. Hey, what are you talking about? No fucking way! Is this the guy hitting on you? -Take a step back, dude! -Atıl! Atıl, stop! I'm bored here. Come on, let's go. I'm bored. Girl, you and your boredom... Eylül, what is he doing? I'll handle it. Don't make fun of him. -Tek, you're making a fool of yourself. -Come home. It's over. We're going back tomorrow morning. Look, it's been a great month. But it's over. -What were you thinking? -I'll do anything. I'll be the man you want me to be. Just come. Tek, I told you. I told you not to trust me, not to get used to me. -This is who I am. -But you've told me... Hey, don't follow me. Come on. I just left him like that. Left him. Let me go! I said let me go! I have to go somewhere! Eylül! That's enough. You are not okay. What do you mean? After the accident... You couldn't recover fully. What happened to me? Eylül, we called the hospital. -Hospital? -They're waiting for you. -You'll be fine! -What happened to me? Eylül, we have to go. Please don't. Let's go. They're waiting for us. -Eylül! -Eylül! Take your gift back, Tek. Eylül, wait. -I didn't like your gift. -Eylül! -Eylül! -Eylül, wait! Eylül, stop! Wait! Eylül, don't go! Eylül! Eylül, wait! -Open the door, Eylül! -Eylül! Eylül! I didn't like this memory. I didn't like this girl. I missed the story you told me. Please, take me back there. Gülah! -Gülah, Where is Tek? -Here. What do you mean here, Gülah? Where is Tek? Here! You finally remembered everything, Eylül? What is it? Hi. It's me, Tek. Do I know you? I can't remember. What do you want? No. No! Can we have two cups of tea? No. No... Anybody? Help me! Anybody? Don't come closer! Eylül! Tek. Tek! Tek! I was so scared! I was so scared, Tek! Tek, I thought I was going crazy! Tek! Tek! Tek. Tek... Tek, where are you going? Tek! Now you know, Eylül. You don't deserve a second chance. You are only watching the end of a story from long ago. Eylül. Enough, Tek. Let me go. Eylül, come on. The plane is leaving. Send this guy off before I kick his ass. Okay, calm down. One second. Listen to yourself. Don't be this needy. That's not why I came. Why did you come? -To hear you say it once. -Say what? That you were in love with me. At least let me know it was real. You got me quite wrong. It's not love. You're lying. You went out in the crowd thanks to me, found someone to talk to. You lived thanks to me, instead of staying at home dreaming. You're not in love with me, Tek. You need me. Eylül... You're a prisoner here, a coward. You can't come where I'm going. Forget me. I'm too cheerful to fall in love. Tek. Tek, I'm back. I came back. Tek. Tek, I'm here. Look at me. Tek! Tek! Tek, come on. Let's go home, Tek. Tek, I'm here. Tek. Tek! Tek! -Nothing to be afraid of, right? -There's much to be afraid of. But I'm not afraid anymore. I'm not afraid anymore. Tek, stop! Stop, wait! Tek! I'm with you. See? I'm gonna save you. Tek! A SAD LOSS FOR US OUR COLLEAGUE, CARTOONIST TEKİN BULUT HAS PASSED AWAY No! Stop! Tek! -Eylül don't! Eylül! -No, I have to go back! No! I'm sorry. I am sorry. I'm sorry. This will be lost. No, it won't be. The waves will take it, bring it to the shores of wherever you go.
