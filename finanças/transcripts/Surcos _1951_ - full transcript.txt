Surcos (1951) FURROWS Even to the last villages, suggestions come from the city, inviting farmers to abandon the soil, with promises of easy wealth. With temptations from the city, not able to manage them, these farmers who lost the field but not won the city, are trees without roots, that life destroys and corrupts. This is the most painful problem of our time. Eugenio Montes. This is not a symbol but an unfortunate event in contemporary life. FILM DECLARED OF NATIONAL INTEREST Attention, the arriving train from Valladolid and Salamanca which arrives at 1:45, just passed by the station... Hurry up. It will enter through gate 6. Watch your steep dumb woman. She is a villager. We have to take the subway. - You know the way? - Of course. Looks like they are moving. I wonder where are their mattresses? Taxi for hire. Be careful. Is Engracia's house nearby? Maybe Pepe made a mistake. - Let's ask. - We are close. He knows, he did military service here. If not for that, you would all rot digging the soil. He is right, we are here thanks to him. - But this is not as he said. - Well, I like it. Take the corner, two blocks ahead. You see? They are for our relatives. Does Mrs Engracia lives here? Yes, what's wrong with that? It doesn't look like a palace. - She is a beast. - Look, she... We should call an officer. She deserves that. If we do that this wouldn't happen. You say that because you are a beater. Everyone for herself. There are men for every taste. - You say that because of yours. - What about mine? Nothing, take it easy. Another one. Another one. Pass. I stay on 30. What are they coming for? Don't you see? They sell stuff. - Pepe, about time. - Hello Pili. - This is your family? - Yes My father, my sister Tonia, my brother Manolo, and my mother. Mother, the relatives are here. - Good, welcome! - Thanks. Boys, leave that. - This is good. - It is. It's the best, I saved it for you. I wanted to bring them all for a coop. He still thinks about the hen-house and the farm. I just wanted to make some money. Here you earn money differently, being clever and doing everything. We all know our trade. Workers like us there are few. What makes money is..., you don't understand, but we need to earn money at all costs, because the daily wage at the village is no good. You have to take advantage of what you know, and either you have money or you are worth nothing. - He knows what's up his sleeves. - Of course. That's why I told them, at the village, everything will be the same, however in the capital, you make money by just wanting to do it. Pepe is right, everyone makes a living here. Tonia, can you open? Mrs Engracia, my mother asks for a quarter of beans. You have money? She says she will pay soon when my father works. Tell your mother that there is no more living for free, I will not give her a thing until she brings money, understood? Yes ma'am. Those leeches think they can eat with our work, just what we needed. Money is not abundant, but we have something for some days and paying you. You buy your own food, about the house... How much? We'll see, but rent fee increased last month. - Do you have a lot? - You'll see. Look. You have enough for the rent. First thing is making people work, make Tonia work in whatever comes, you have to start somewhere. As soon as we start working, we can... What you earn? I am as good as anyone. - If I find something for you. - We will help each other. He has to give us a hand since he brought us here. I think I can be cuplé singer. - I can sing. - Don't be fool, I know things and look, I sell cigarettes. - Does that give money? - Tiredness, get in the bed. I sleep next to the wall. Don't, you need delicate hands. I'd love to have stockings like those. Well, you know, no pain, no gain. I'll buy mine with my first earnings. Ok. Then I'll buy a blouse like yours. Let me sleep. In the village, the medic's daughter wears sheer stockings, but I was told I am prettier than her. Are you listening? I could have married a good man there, but Pepe says here... Are you listening? Are you sleeping? Turn off the light and get to sleep. Will we be able to go? - Asking, one gets to Rome. - Pepe could come. He doesn't need to, I know someone who can give him work, that's why he is coming with me. Do I go to the office too? Ask in various shops if they need help. She can get lost. She has to learn. Let's go father. Good bye. Good luck. - Go ahead, there is the first shop. - Bye. Mellao, there is your woman. She is not alone. - Hi guys. - Hi Pili. - Hello. This is Pepe, my relative. My boyfriend and his friends, Juan, Carlos, Enrique. I told you, he's looking for job, you could give him a hand. I have first class license, I used to drive a truck at the service. Carlos has a vacant Packard. - And I will have a blonde for me. - Don't you like me anymore? - I meant a blonde truck. - Soon? I am in talks with Chamberlain about my percentage. - Get as much as you can. - Why so interested? As you see, I need a new dress. - It's not going to happen. - Don't deny me the dress I need. No woman is taking money from me, you know that, - regardless I love you the same. - Leave me alone! Don't be upset, I do that over my principles, you can get that dress from your savings. I'll pay these when I get some money. Guys, shop is open. You are spoiled, have a nice day, honey. Hi beautiful, what you got? Ah, Don Roque, good morning, - do you want something? This one, how much? It's thirteen, for you. - Is Mellao there? - Better if he is in hell. - You fought? - Someday I'll smash his face. Here, keep the change. - Thanks. - Bye Pili. Hey, get out, you hear me? Get out. I know about women, I mistreat them and go by car. Morning boss. - Here comes Chamberlain. - Hello guys. - What's up Don Roque? - Just passing by. Don Roque. What about our business? If you want something, you know my terms. He is sly, but he will not trick me. I swear. What if someone steals your deal while you discuss the percentage? I don't know anyone with the guts, do you? Hey, if you make a deal, he can come with us... Shut up. - He wants a Packard. - A Packard? - I didn't say that, I said... - That's easy, there are a lot in the street, You, go ahead and get one for him. - Ok, leave him alone. - I told you to get him one, at the corner, one that costs 0.95. How do you want it? A black one like a patent leather shoe? Or a red one like a pepper? We better get it ourselves, maybe there is still one at the market. You sit down and wait for us. You are not dressed for buying a Packard to him. - I'll get the Sunday suit. - Let's go. Don't worry if we are delayed, it will be because of the gas. He will pay. Don't mind them, they are good guys, but you know, when there is a hick around... - I am no hick. - Ok man, ok, just take it easy. What? Shall we polish? Employment Office Open from 9 to 12:30 Next. - Where did they come from? - Maybe from Salamanca. Hey, where are you from? - From the countryside. - Shut up. Is he forbidden to speak? They come only to screw us over, as if we were few. You also came from the country. That was long time ago, - I wasn't getting someone else's bread. - You get wheat from paving stones? - If I can. - You have to teach me, I provide for my entire street. - Next. - Yes sir. - Name? - Manuel Pérez. - Age? - I'll be 56 on seed-time. - Profession? - Farmer. Where will you delve? On asphalt? - I was told... - You are all told everything, but things are different. - What can you do? - Farm things. I'll write you down as laborer. Laborer? Address? It's here. - Will I work tomorrow? - Tomorrow? He thinks work is plentiful. - I need a job. - We will let you know. Be patient. Next. Manuel Pérez. I'm son of the previous person. Farmer, and wants to work tomorrow, right? Next. Juan Pérez, farmer, I come to reap the wheat that grows between the paving stones, and I'm not relative of the previous person. Tobacco, matches. Virginia tobacco. Tobacco sir? Tobacco, matches. Virginia tobacco. Tobacco sir? - How much for this one? - Thirteen. - How is it going? - I need the box empty to make something. Life is a bitch, you don't even get enough to make a living. You can't complain, I've sold less. But you don't have someone to take your money and make you feel miserable. - How much for this? - Forty. - This one? - Seventy. There are some people. Hey, did you lose something? No, I was looking for you. Did Mellao help you? I've visited many auto shops, they say they will consider me. I thought so, that idiot... - How much for this one? - Forty. - How many? - One. I guess you are a millionaire. An officer, let's go. Wait for me at the courtyard, at 10 o'clock. - Hi, did they catch you? - Me? No one puts a hand on me. Look, if you are smart you'll get a job. You say nothing? What do I say? I think that's good. - Only that? - What else? Get happy, man. I am, of course. Hey... - Hi Pili. - Night Mrs Amalia. Do you know Mellao is jealous? Jealous? He doesn't like that you are living with me. Me? - You are more man than him. - But you... What? - You are his girlfriend. - Yeah. Are you going to marry him? Well, I will marry someone with enough money to treat me like a queen. I've thought a lot about you. Me too. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts... Wow! I told you this was ok only at the village. We've always done this, we shouldn't stop. - About the job? - Lots of girls. We were at the office, it will take long. You? Me? You can almost say I got something. Learn from him. Pepe, he does something! - Morning Don Roque. - Hi Pili. - He is my relative. - What can you do? - I have first class license. - My truck requires gently handling. - Don't worry about that. - Turn it on and let's see. Go ahead, open the door. - Good, right? - Not bad. Will you hire him? If salary is good for him, he'll be on probation. He is worth more than Mellao, and for the same. You know a lot don't you? You know what you know. We'll see. A beer It says very clear in here, trolleys are an improvement for Madrid. An improvement? Can you ride on the step? No. - Can you ride without paying? - No. You call that an improvement? Good morning boss. - Hello Don Roque. - Hello. - I came for the answer. - What? I told you my terms yesterday. Ah yes, about the truck, no deal, I found someone cheaper. I'm not in the mood for a joke. I'm telling you the truth. Who is the suicide? A villager, his name is Pepe. Two problems here, one with that hick and another person, - the other one with you. - Yes? You know I know what you know, if I talk I'll ruin your business. A legal business clear as the day, and I can choose my people as I want, not being afraid of anyone, not even you. (Whistling Cuando pasa el amor.) Hey, what did you lose? - I wanted to see you. - Hurry up, I'm hungry. - I ate already. - Wait for me then. You scoundrel! Pili is getting beaten! Pili, defend yourself! Shame on you! Men today... This will cost you dearly. You know who did it, he'll do the same to you. I'll smash his face. I'm coming too. - He's looking for a fight. - I'll give him some. - Let him come. - No, or else there is no fight. Let's calm down. Tell your boss he won't have a driver for some time. Men fight alone, let's see what happens. Punch him Pepe! No fighting inside!, get out! Come on! No fighting inside!, out! Stop it. I said stop it. Officer, it's just boys' stuff. - They can say that at the station. - I vouch for them. - Ok then. - They won't fight again. Pepe, get to work, it's over. You'll remember me. You are some friends. Keep walking. I have good eye for men. - Well said! - Who are you? Pepe's sister. She's at home with us. What do you do? - She's looking for work. - If you know something. Maybe, do you cook? - Same as every woman. - Go around the corner, number 6... So I ran there, a beautiful woman opened the door, with a nice silk robe and feathers in the neck, sleeves and shoes, - and she told me... - You are the new girl, right? - I told her... - Yes ma'am, at your service. - She told me... - Come in and wait. So I came inside, first to a room with good furniture, then a dining room with a shining lamp, and pictures of beautiful women, like Pili's, above her bed, but real pictures, also dolls and other things. I was watching, when she came back with a black robe and told me... Hey, take this, try it on. - I'm embarrassed to get nude. - Don't be a fool. So I tried the robe, but it was big, but she told me she will take care of that, and to come get my stuff and get back, I have to make her diner, she will give me 20 duros a month and some clothes, and I came running. - Who may she be? - A friend of Chamberlain. - So, not an honest woman. - What is that? What do you care? Anyway, I'll talk to her. Come on, get your stuff. Also, she doesn't like my name, a village name, she will call me Tony. You shouldn't go. - You think? - What for? She has to learn for herself. I'm ready. - You got everything? - Yes. - Then go now. - Isn't she coming? - What for? You'll tell us everything on your free day. - Ok, bye. - Bye. Don't waste the money. No. (Humming Cuando pasa el amor.) Well.

Unbelievable, you let them take 50 duros, with life as it is, with all the bills, and we don't have a real, you will be my ruin, you should have stayed at the village, working the field forever. - That would have been better. - What? Shut up. - Bye honey. - Leave me alone. - What a temper!, and what a dress, - I see you are thriving. - Let me go, I dress as I like. - Give me that. - I'll pay. Here, take this, keep the change.

A cortado. - Did you get your pay? - Yes. How much? Same as always, not enough for the jacket, people treat you based on looks, and think you are a slut. - It will be increased. - You are a fool. - Why? - Two weeks are enough for probation. Chamberlain has other better paid jobs you can do. - You think I can... - Of course, he gave you the job for a reason, you could be a driver at the village. Here, you make money or you are left behind, if you are ambitious you'll find it. - Whatcha drinking? - A beer. A beer. The jobs, are they honest? Mellao doesn't have that scruples. Again Mellao. Talk with them, they are in business right now, then you talk with Chamberlain. Come on. Am I not worth it? - How much do you ask? - 300. No way. Business are bad, and people are all over me. - How much? - 200. - That's a theft. - 40 duros each, take it or leave it. - 45. - No more. Ok. Get away. See you soon. Good night, right on time. - The others? - In the truck. - You are here because you want. - Yes. - I gave you a legitimate job. - Yes.

Don't read magazines or you will waste electricity. Yes ma'am. - Wake me up tomorrow at eleven. - Yes ma'am. - I want a hot bath ready. - Yes ma'am. Here it is, let's go. What an annoying movie, what's that called again? Neorealism. I don't know why they like showing misery, when millionaire's life is so nice. That's what they say. Look! What is she doing there? She has stolen something. Hey, wake up, what have you got in there? Answer me. Nothing, my clothes. Your clothes, yeah right. - Where were you going? - Home. - Why? - Calm down and let's talk. - No one is calming down, - take her to the police station. - No. No? You find a taxi. - At this time? - Then on foot, but you are taking this thief to the station. An innocent girl. Go, I'll check if something is missing. Ok, tell me now what happened. I tried a stocking and I tore it. A stocking? You tried a stocking? - I did. - What for? Well, I have legs. Tell your mother to come talk to me, but don't say any of this. Now go. Now I find out she knows how to sing. Well, she has potential, but she needs to learn at an academy. No one is born a singer, all of them learned and now they are earning a lot. That must be expensive. Of course, but is an inversion, you will get it back soon. How much costs that? With a letter of mine, 40 duros. No way, back to the kitchen, it's a lot. I can work and save. No, this is your chance, my friends can place you in the "Neighborhood Fest". - The "Neighborhood Fest"? - Exciting, right? Of course, I have thought about that so many times, once I tried to escape the village for it. We can do this, I will pay the fee. - Then? - She will pay me when she can. I am sorry, I don't like it. Think about it, if you agree, send her to me, I'll give her the letter. Another one. Please, where is this? Down there. - Thank you. - Welcome. Ole! Ole! Ole! Careful, he is robbing you, go, go after him. Go, run. Fast, run. - I was robbed. - Who, me? - I don't know. - Go bother someone else. Stop, stop that, stop! My stuff. That's unfair, I saw him being robbed, and now is all gone. Why were you here? Now keep walking. Keep walking, please keep walking. Keep walking people. If you are hesitant, you will be hungry. - I don't like Chamberlain. - So what? Let's hear my husband. Forget about that, woman. He has his ideas. Bah, village ideas. - Tonia, can you help me? - Yes ma'am. - Good night. - Hello. - Hello. Manolo? Didn't you see him? No, why? He is never late, he is two hours late now. Perhaps he is partying with his pay. You bought a suit? It was lent to me. - Are we dining? - Right now. - Hello, you are late. - Yes. Are you dining? No. You have the pay, right? Didn't you receive it? Bah, he got emotional. - What is it? - He drank his pay. - No! - Explain yourself. - I was fired. - Did you do something bad? The goods were stolen, and the owner blames me. He says I have to pay the 30 duros. 30 duros? Nothing less than 30 duros. I said it before, he is worthless. - I won't give anything. - We will have to pay. No with my money, we don't know the truth. If you pay once, a second is in order. You shouldn't spoil him, make him work and pay for it. Work? Where? - What? Am I useless? - As you hear. That's what you think, you will see what I am capable of! - Manolo! - Leave him! - Manolo! - Leave him! He'll come back when he is hungry and with his lesson learned. Manolo! Manolo! Manolo! Manolo! Manolo! Manolo! Manolo! Manolo! Manolo! Bye honey. We should go out sometime together. - Careful Felipe, she is mine. - You wish. - Watch the hands. - What a brat. - Shall I walk with you honey? - I know the way. Father, a letter for you. ♪ ...does not have my scent ♪ ♪ alay of the Moon, your hand cuts me, ♪ - ♪ and I don't care... ♪ - Where did you learn that? It's indecent. The miss I work for sings it. What about the letter? - Not from the village. - Maybe about Manolo. See what is it Tonia. - It's for father. - What is it? - About a job. - It must be wrong. This is my name. I have a job, you see? - Until I see it... - I have job for men. Take this apron for you, - and go to the kitchen where you belong. - Jesus, what a mood. You, go to the store and tell the owner I'll pay Manolo's debt. - Give me my new jacket. - Right away. - Laborer. - What's my job? Do you have working clothes? You don't want to work with your suit. - I don't have. - I'll give you an overall. I'm sorry, we don't plant nor reap, this is a factory not a field. Well, I thought... but I need the job. Ok, I'm going to bed, I'm sleepy. Tonia, bed. - Do I wash the dishes? - He will do it. Ok. See you tomorrow. Tonia, where are you going? Isn't that your bedroom? I sleep with Engracia now. - Why? - I don't know. Ok, go. - Hello. - It's so cold. - So? - A few duros. - Did you dine? - Yes. Not good as laborer. - I... - Keep going, all is explained. I'll go to bed, you? - Yes. - Don't take long. Pepe! - Yes? - Where are you going? Sleeping, I need to wake up early. - Pili sleeps there. - I know. We are a couple. You scoundrel! I make money here and I do what I want! Take your money and live your way, but not in front of me! Shut up and let people sleep. You heard it, if you don't like it... - Hi. - Did you find something? I'm tired, there are no good rooms. We must wait for an opportunity. Wait? Can't you do something else? It's always waiting. I can't turn into a house. - I can't stand your father. - He will give way. Besides, I want to dump the cigarettes and live like a madam, with a maid and everything. What can we do? We could use the room upstairs. What do you think? We can buy a bedroom suite on payments. But Chamberlain... He's got a lot in his mind, he wouldn't care. - Will it take much longer? - A bit. Thank you. One, two, three, ha. One, two, three, ha. One, two, three, ha. One, two, three, ha. One, two, three, ha. One, two, three, ha. One, two... let's go, hurry up, run! Run, faster. He will catch us. It's over, let's go. Be careful or you will scald yourself. Rosario told me about the goods. - Did they fire you? - Yes sir. - Do you have a home? - I ran away. Not good, you should go back. I don't want to listen to my mother, maybe she had to pay for the stuff. Are you from around here? I came from the countryside, we all came looking for job. - Didn't you have jobs? - Yes, but they thought one lives better here. What will you do now? You can stay for a while. Thank you, - but I will leave. - Don't be fool, there's always room for one more. Father, you could teach him how to use the puppets. - I won't learn. - Anyone can learn, it's just about learning the stories, and talk like a chicken. If you grow to like it, you'll make up new tricks, at least it works for me. Look, you draw the curtain, and the show is on. I'm really desperate, my husband wasted his two week pay, that scamp, bandit. Hey, what is this? Are you talking bad about me? You are really a swindle. What? You disrespect me, you will see, my father told me, about a very powerful argument to persuade you. What will this scoundrel do? Hey, lower your head. Are you convinced you owe me obedience? Let me think about it. Lower your head. Are you convinced now? Yes, I think I am recovered now. Take this! Ha ha ha. This is the best argument you can use with women. Rosario, if he stays you will have to go sleep with Petronila. I can sleep in the floor. It's not about the bed, it's about the gossips, understood? Singing and Dancing Academy. You here? I was around and decided to wait for you. How are things? Good, teacher says I can debut next week. Next week? One step is difficult and she wants me to do it right. Singing is what matters, dancing is an ornament. That's what I say, but you know her. It's good to have you here, now I won't walk alone. Let's go. Why the umbrella with this nice weather? For elegance, and gives personality. I wanted to grab your arm. With all my heart. - If someone could look at us. - Who? - The miss, for example. - Never mind her, she is in the past. - I like you. - Really? Look at those nice things. Hey Tonia, - you clearly need some of this. - Eh? For the debut, we talked about it with your mother. - Ah, ok. - Let's go in. Pili! Pili! Where are the stairs? What's up with her? Right here, careful. - I can't see the stairs. - You are dumb. - Hi. - What is it? I wanted you to keep me this. - Where is Pepe? - Working. - Is this your nest? - If you call this sty a nest. Better than the one you had. What is that? Are you having a baby? I will debut. Look. - What do you think? - Not bad. See this, is nice. I don't want this at home to be seen. Nice, right? Very nice, it's all artificial silk. Can I use your mirror? Good luck goes to the fools, with my age I barely have clothes. If you had danced. If I had run into a moron like Chamberlain instead of your brother. Were you dating someone before Pepe? Mellao, I would be better with him. Give me that. Chamberlain spent some money. He has money. - What did this cost you? - A kiss. Is he pleased with little? Mellao could have done this? - Nothing. - We're lucky. Lucky? It's guts and good driving. Anyway, it was close. We should stay low for a while. - Ok, go now. - The stuff? I'll do it, see you tomorrow. Pili. Pili. - Pili! - Coming, coming. Hurry up! Something on fire? - Help me unload. - Am I here for that? All day alone, half the nights too, and now this. I am not your slave. - Where you bitten by a tarantula? - I'm sick. That's why I am at night in the roads, exposed to being killed by the police. We were shot today. Yes, Chamberlain has idiots like you, to buy your sister lace and silk. - What? - He wants her as concubine, and Tonia is all excited, in such a way, she thinks they will marry, he will give her an apartment. - Shut up. - You really are a fool, if he tried to do that with my sister, I wouldn't allow it, it would cost him dearly, fifty-fifty on this, or I am not my mother's daughter. - I am not your mother's son. - Well. Nothing to envy there, mine consents as much as yours. Damn, this is heavy. Of course, between Chamberlain and you, a few clothes, living in this hole, always the same. - If I wanted to... - What? I could leave you for someone else. Who? Say it. Mellao, if you don't treat me like a queen. May I? Come in. Speak. The trucks will leave Vigo in ten days, will arrive Madrid early morning. - Do you want to do it? - Na-ha. I prefer to just sell the info. I'll charge for bag, and I'll know how many bags were stolen. I always pay. I'm still mad about the job. Get the truck this time, bigger profit for you. I think about Pili, I still like her, so, fine if he gets the better part, Don't take me wrong, it's just about principles. - Hello Pepe. - Hello. Polish? - Is the boss here? - In his office. - We need to talk. - Be quick, I'm busy. It's about my sister. What about her? I know about your gifts. So what? Well... I'm waiting. Well, it's wrong and I came here to tell you. Did Pili sent you? It's not about her. Pili is a smart snake, I guess what she told you, but you are an honest man, and didn't listen, right? Yes. You are from a village, there, if you make gifts is for a reason, it's different here, I do it for the arts, understood? But Pili said: "I'll make Pepe take advantage of Chamberlain", but it's not happening. Of course you aren't trying that. Are you? Someone else would fire you, I don't, I would feel sorry. Pili is using you, and that happens to anyone but me. I don't care about women, you know? But I will give you a chance, in a few days there will be a good job, I won't fire you, but help you. Maybe Pili will be pleased, although you better leave her. Understood? - Yes sir. - Then go! Remember, I couldn't care less about your sister. I couldn't care less. - Your share. - That much? - It was a good week. - Thanks. I guess you'll buy your own tobacco now. With this I have 40 duros, - 10 to spare. - To spare? I'll pay my mother the store owner debt. Ah, ok. With money, she will have no objection to see me. - He wants to see his family. - It's Saturday. I want them to meet her. Can I go father? I don't like you being outside at nights. - She is coming with me. - Well, that's different. - I can even buy her something. - No, not that, we should save it too. What? Is there another store owner? - Manolo! - Hello father. - Who's she? - She is Rosario. Manolo lives and works with my father, we love each other, but as God commands. Come in. - You took your time. - I had to raise the money. Where is mother? They went to the "Neighborhood Fest", they go all Saturdays. I wanted to pay her. - You can wait for her. - There is singing there, right? - I think so. - Let's go and let's take your father. No, I'm not in the mood for partying. You should have a good time once in a while. Come with us, I'm paying. Much money? - While it lasts. - Come with us, it's just one day. - What about that? - While you get ready, I'll finish it. Ok, let's go. THE LATIN ONE NEIGHBORHOOD FEST Take off your cap. Watch your step girl. You with the beret, sit down. Why is she so bad? She is afraid of breaking herself. Take calcium, it will fatten you. Also vitamins, they go along. I think she has the right to be thin, if she wants. Thin women have charm too. Of course. Ladies and gentlemen, and now...

Everyone is required to knock. I guess you will marry my sister now. Are you here to force me? I'm here to finish you if you don't. Do it. Don't you dare? Don't you have a knife? Take it. Please understand, she is my sister, what you did is wrong, I came here on good will. What do you want? Money? Did Pili sent you? Leave Pili out of this. I want you to marry her. What a villager, you are all fools and you are the biggest one, do you think I hired you because of your pretty face? I liked Tonia, but now I don't care about her. What happened is over now. Leave! - Is that final? - Yes, I said leave! I don't want to see you again, the garage must be empty tomorrow, be careful with what you say! (Whistling Cuando pasa el amor.) This is your stupid sister's fault, I never liked her. Shut up. "Shut up", yeah, and now what do we do? Will she support us? I'm leaving. - Where? - With Mellao, he is not a fool. - Wait. - Leave me. - There is still tonight's job. - You going? Why not, my dismissal starts tomorrow. - Hi. - Hi Pepe. - So? - Be ready for tonight. - No way. - Why not? - I don't want trouble with Chamberlain. - We know already. If things go well, he won't fire me. I'm not taking the chance. Are you leaving me on my own? - You? - I'd go, but... - We'll go fifty-fifty. - Ok, I'll see. - Ten o'clock, at the garage. - If I can. Ten o'clock, don't forget. What did he say? - He wants me to go with him. - You? - Me... - You go to bed early. - Let him go alone if he dares. - He will go. If he wants. Keep still, you make me nervous. That moron is late, - I can't wait any longer. - Are you going alone? - I have no choice. - What about Chamberlain? Screw him, when he arrives, he won't find anything. - Bye. - Bye. - You don't kiss me? - You are not going to war. If all goes well, we'll leave and I'll buy you a mouton coat. - Ok. - Don't fall asleep, I'll sound three times and you open, we leave the car as if it had not left. Hello Pili. You? Do I scare you, honey? - Why are you here? - For you. Just don't you hurry up, - Pepe will take his time. - He will crush you. He must be half dead in the highway now. I warned the truck guys, you see? That's all. Traitor. You are coming with me, Pepe and you are through. - Grab your things. - What if I don't go? You want it baby, I will slap you a bit, that's right, but then we'll be two doves in love. - Let's go. - I don't want to. Let's go, or else the music will start, and that won't be right, by the bed. Let's go, come on, let's go. If there is something of value, take it, even if it is not yours. It's him, crooked, you'll see now. Pepe!, Pepe!, what happened? - I can't take it anymore. - Tell me, what happened? Everything went wrong, someone tipped off them. Someone? Pepe, so you know, it was me. - You swine! - I'm taking Pili, - but before... - I'm hurt, or else... - No, leave him! - Move. Pili! Pili! Help me! I'm dying! I warned you, if something went wrong, I was to wash my hands. Please, don't leave me! We must return. Now? So people laugh at us? How embarrassing. Even with embarrassment, we must return.
