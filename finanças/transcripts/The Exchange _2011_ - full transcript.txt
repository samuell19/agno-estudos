The Exchange The... paradox of E.P.R. Stirred up popular reaction from people who aren't necessarily scientists, who tried to prove our inability to describe an objective reality and our supposed inability... How's it going? - Fine. What do you think? What is it? It's the new facade. It solved the light problem with an inner space and now the facade is clean. You don't say? You'd be surprised. Great. Hi, this is Oded & Tami, please leave a message. Hi, honey. Never mind, I think I left my orange binder at home. Bye. What did I want to ask you? How did it go today? Any progress? I fell asleep like an idiot. I started watching that movie you brought and fell asleep. I'll never finish the project at this rate. I was here today. When? In the afternoon. So why didn't you wake me up? I don't know, you were sleeping. I didn't want to wake you up. You should have woken me up. I'll never finish the project at this rate. It was kind of strange. Like coming home sick from school, the house looks different. Oded? Will you join me for lunch? No, I think I'll go home for an hour or so. Tami called, she needs something. Will you be back at the lab on time? We have to get some work done. They'll be here first thing Thursday. We'd better have something. Right. I'll be right back. She needs some kind of ointment. I'll be back in an hour. "Tami & Oded Sivan" Hey. Were you just running? No. Just the stairs... What's up? I made a little progress I may surprise myself yet. What? Nothing. Oded? Excuse me? Oded! Hi. I'm Adi. I'm in your class. - Yes? I spoke to Prof. Kanot about my thesis. He suggested I speak to you. It's just that I am in a hurry. So shall I leave it in your box and... we'll set a time later? Oh, gladly. If the first measurement gives an upwards spin, then the other spin is necessarily downwards. And vice versa. In other words, collapse of the wave function... And seemingly... an influence from afar. Where was I? These are the results of the second experiment. I'll start writing the introduction today. Ephraim, I might take tomorrow off. Tami has a few tests, she needs me to drop her off. I hope everything's all right. Yes. It's nothing special. Or are congratulations in order? What... Oh. We'll see. Should I ask Gil to cover for me? Then I can stay with her. No problem. Honey. Aren't you gonna say goodbye? Say... Have you got any plans for the day? I am meeting Sandra. I'm helping her choose kitchen tiles. This week at Superclean, more than 50 percent off on all cleaning products... What's up, honey? Long day? You look exhausted. Yes. How was it with Sandra? Okay. She's funny, isn't she? She's kind of funny, isn't she? I guess so. Didn't she make you laugh? Sure, we laughed. What... What's that? What? You went like this with your eyebrows. No. - Yes you did. Are you hiding something? - I didn't do that. Are they going to publish your article? No. Don't lie to me. Are they going to publish it? Maybe. I knew it. Did you want to surprise me? You're such a bad liar. Where have you been? What? - I've been trying to reach you all day on your cell, at the university. You don't answer. No big deal. Guess what? What? - Carmon's office got my portfolio and they want to meet me. Really? Wow. That's great. She told me they were very impressed and that they're looking for someone with my unique eye and touch. That's great. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. What's happening? Why is your cell phone off? I had a class, so I turned it off. What's the matter? The damn car broke down, I never got there. I've been working on this portfolio for a whole month. You can go another time. Give me a break. Do you think they work for me? I called and said I wouldn't make it, the secretary said she'd see what she could do. They'll call, don't worry. A month's work, I'm such an idiot. The car just broke down? There was this thumping sound and then it just stopped. Did you look under the hood? I did but what do I know about that stuff? Wasn't there anyone who could have helped? What's with you? What's with you? What? - You keep... Is that all you ever think about? I lost a contact lens. I once spent a night in the bomb shelter. I forgot my keys... And slept in the building's bomb shelter. Do you want a blow job? Hey, don't make a face. Oded? I brought you my proposal. My thesis? We spoke a few days ago. It's just the general idea. I want to deal with complex systems, but... I'm open to suggestions. Okay, I'll call. We'll be in touch. Oded? Don't take this the wrong way, but if you have a few minutes, we can have some coffee together, just to get to know each other. Are you busy? You don't come here very often. He asked for your name so he can call us when the pizza is ready. No, I... I usually wait to eat at home. With my wife. Does your wife also work in the field? In the university? No, she's an architect. She just graduated, she's looking for a job. Well, the truth is, our field is pretty masculine, isn't it? Hold on a second, OK? Hey, man... Yoav. Oded. - I'm... Sorry if I put you on the spot the other day. It's okay. You've been to the shelter? Have you got any plans for tomorrow? Are you okay? What? - You keep asking what I'm doing. You never used to care, now you keep asking where, when, how much I'll be... It's just that I might not be back tomorrow night, that's why I'm asking... What do you mean, not be back? I'm going south with Ephraim, to the observatory. They have a new project and they want to know if we'll run it. And you just remembered this now? I guess I forgot to tell you. It slipped my mind. What does running the project entail? It means going down there every so often, making sure the observations are done properly, analyzing results. You know. Take care. Call me, tell me what's happening, Of course. Bye. - Bye. Odedi... Do you love me? Of course. What's up? Yes, I'm here. I arrived. It's quiet. Like the countryside. Are you in bed already? Good, honey. Sleep well. Good night. I miss you. Do you work around here? At the university. What do you do? I'm getting a PhD in physics. That's great. I love popular science. Mrs. Katz, I'm coming to burn your wall carpet. I'll set it on fire, that and your bowl of plastic fruit! I'm shouting into empty apartments. I'm gonna lie on your floor and on the parquet in your bedroom floor and I'll unravel and unravel and unravel! And your stereo! And your fridge! And I'm gonna touch your soap dish! And your blanket! I'll sleep inside your kitchen tap. - And piano! I'll go in the bath with my shoes on. And the living room tiles! And the walls! And the carpet! - I'll touch the sink! And the cable box with the rubber buttons! And the sofa! And the jar... where you keep your olive oil! And I'm gonna touch your corners! There isn't much in a house... Does your wife work around here too? No, she is looking for a job. She's wearing the long sleeves... Because of the implants in her elbow. She's self-conscious about the scars. It doesn't bother me, it doesn't gross me out or anything, but she's embarrassed. She thinks everyone can see. Do you want to go and speak to her? Huh? - Lf you feel like. I'll watch. No. What have I got to say to her? It's... What have I got to say to her? Ask her about a credit. Investments. Open an account. Are you short of questions? Hello. - Hello. I'd like to open an account. Certainly. Business or personal? Personal. Will you be transferring an account? Yes. I am just asking because... because we offer benefits for account transfers. You need to fill out some forms. No problem. Mrs. Sivan? Yoav. Oded's Judo Teacher. It's been a long time. Yes. How's he doing? Very well. He is finishing his PhD in physics with honors. He always was a good son. Yes. I was thinking of getting my son a library card. How old is he? - Twelve. Very nice. But I don't know whether it's worth it. Do kids still come here? Not many, but some do. 'Cause it looks a little deserted. Well, if your child comes and then another... and another... Do you really believe that? What do you mean? Nothing can take the place of a library. People talk about computers, the internet, but there's no substitute for a good book. Sure there is. Everything can be replaced. In a few years they'll close it down... they'll downsize the budget... There'll be nothing here. Oded? How are you? Were you running? No, I got off at the wrong stop. I wasn't paying attention. How's Tami? All right? Who? Tami? Oh, right... They've put her under observation. You don't say? Hang in there. Tami? Tami? Hi. Hi. - Hi. What are you doing there? Nothing. Come sit down. Can you get the light? I forgot. Is everything okay? Yes, fine. Listen... I'm pregnant. How? What do you mean, how? I don't know how. However you get pregnant. Funny, huh? Yeah, funny. But good. Yeah, good, huh? - Yeah. Are you happy? Of course. - Really? - Yes. Good. Good. Who's there? - It's me. Me, Oded. Who, I can't hear you. Oded. Is it a bad time? Can I come up? No, no, come on up. Yael just left. Hi. - Hi. Am I interrupting? - No, no. Come in. Just a second. I just cleaned the floor. I try not to leave marks. Tami just told me she's pregnant. That's great. There is always something left... it drives me crazy. I didn't... I didn't know you were trying. Yeah, trying... So? A toast? Sure, why not. Cheers. - Cheers. Let me show you the house. It's okay, it's okay. The bathroom. An empty room. One day this'll be a workroom. Our bedroom. It's a new bed, we just bought it at Ikea. Only 3,000. Comfy? Can I get you a cup of tea? If you don't mind. Make yourself at home. Let me take your shoes off. There's always something left. It drives me crazy. Is there any data you'd like to supply me with? He's my father... I don't know... An elbow or something? No. Do you think everyone in my family is crippled? Just buy a bag. Hello. Hello. I would like to buy a bag. Sure. Are you looking for a man's or a woman's? Woman's. There are different colours. There is red. With a zipper or without. You'll have it for years. This is yours. Odedi, you freaked me out. Why are you standing there like that? What's this hideous bag doing here? Why hideous? I don't know, what is it? I bought it for you. You're kidding! Where did you get it? Never mind, if you don't like it I can throw it out. No, I like it. It's just kind of old. You surprised me, but thanks, honey. What's the matter? Are you all right? I'm tired. Honey... What? Nothing. We haven't been to a movie for so long. Yeah, I know I've been a bit distant lately. Really? I'm so involved with this project I kind of forget you. But it'll be over soon, I can't wait to submit it. Yeah... Things happen all the time and I don't tell you or I forget. I used to tell you everything, but now, with so much going on, I forget. What kind of things don't you tell me? All kinds. Tell me one. Well, for instance... Last week I shoplifted for the first time in my life. What? I knew I shouldn't have told you. I didn't mean to, I was with Sandra. We bought a present for her sister in some so-called designer store, and just after we left, Sandra realized that her sister already had one and the saleswoman refused to exchange it even though there were signs all over about love and generosity. So on the way out I took a hair pin. I knew I shouldn't have told you. - Why? You're always so righteous. You feel guilty like a child. Do you think I am terrible? - No. - Liar. I don't care. I like the hairpin. Want to fuck? Where? - Come on, we've never done it in public. Stop it! - Okay, okay. Let's go home. Did you ever shout into an empty space? What? An empty space? Where there's nobody there but your voice? Want to try? You motherfuckers! We're going to burn down your club! We'll piss on your ugly green upholstery and stuff the balls up your ass! Try it, it's fun. And we'll steal your cash register and break all your sticks! And I'll touch your corners. Why don't you... Odedi, let's go. Excuse me, can I help you? How did you see me? You're lying in the middle of the lobby. I lost my contacts. You're Oded's wife, aren't you? Yes. - I've heard a lot about you. Why don't you come over sometime? Is there anything to eat? Yoav invited us for dinner... If it's okay with you... Sure. Fine, then. Yeah, fine. It's so great you are here. Please, come in. They're here... Tami, Oded... Wine, anyone? Have a seat. I heard you're an architect. Yes, I just graduated. We thought about renovating, enlarging the living room. What do you think? That's a very nice hair pin. Is it Asian? I don't know. May I see it? Looks like Thai art. You've been to Thailand? No. - You must. We got married in Thailand. Renewed our vows. In a local ceremony. Where is the wedding cassette? Come on now... I want to dedicate this song to Yoav, my love. Excuse me... Final stop. Hi, you've reached Oded and Tami's place. Please leave a message. Bye. Hi. It's me. I miss you. To my wife and son, who I truly love.
