How are we doing? - [Kevin] Ready when you are boss. - And that is why Kevin Richards - is the best sous-chef in the business. - Stop. Okay, carry on. [Olivia] Dad! - Hey, pumpkin, how was dance? - Good. - We did The Nutcracker. - Yeah? Hi, Stacy. Are there any sugar cookies left for your favorite goddaughter? Well, you are my only goddaughter. But for you, there will always be sugar cookies. Aren't you gonna tell her the news? What news? I, uh... You know the Christmas baking contest you're always talking about? - Uh-huh. - [Olivia] The really fancy one at that Christmas festival in Belgravia? That only the best pastry chefs in the entire world get invited to? And it's on TV? Uh-huh. Well, when you broke up with Paul, I wanted to cheer you up. So I sent in a photo and our recipe - for the Christmas castle cake and... - And... ♪ Ta-da ♪ [Stacy] "At the behest of the Royal Family of Belgravia, the judging committee is pleased to invite you to compete in our 56th International Christmas Baking Competition." Can you believe it? They pay for everything. When is it? We'd leave Friday. Kev, we can't just close up shop right before Christmas. Turns out we can. Belgravia's like a fairy tale. We'd get to stay in a cottage. And they even have a handsome prince. Well, it is an honor just to be invited. Hey, Liv, don't you need some milk with that cookie? Sure. But just so we're clear, I'm team "Let's Go Visit the Handsome Prince." Could you be spontaneous for once in your life? You know I'm not good at spontaneous. This could put us on the map. Maybe. But maybe not. Come on, Stace. Ever since you broke up with Paul, it's like you're scared to do anything different. You plan your life down to the last minute. Well, it's good to have a plan. John Lennon once said that life's what happens when you're busy making other plans. What? And you can't argue with a Beatle? - No. - An event like this will be a lot of work. [Kevin] They're giving us the entire afternoon to prep the kitchen and two days to relax and go sightseeing. Well, maybe if they gave us more notice. Stace, come on. It's not good to stay at home at Christmas alone and feel sorry for yourself. Look, Paul and I were together for three years. Christmas was a really special time for us. Maybe it's time to move on. I am just not ready to. [bell dings] Merry Christmas. Thank you. Christmas sure is a magical time of year, wouldn't you say? Yeah, I just wish I had someone to spend it with. Christmas wishes have been known to come true. Uh, excuse me. Paul? - Stacy, hey. - Hey. I was thinking about you the other day. - You were? - Last Christmas? - That lodge in Vermont? - Yeah, that was pretty terrific. Hey, sweetie. Oh, I'm sorry. - I'm Taylor. - Stacy. Stacy De Novo. I'm sure Paul mentioned me. Actually, no, he didn't. Was he supposed to? - Stacy and I dated for a while. - Yeah. Honey, if we're gonna catch that train, we better run. We're spending Christmas week with Paul's parents. Well, that sounds... - big. - It is. - Do you have any plans for Christmas? - Yeah. Big plans. Super huge. Like what? I will be competing at a baking contest in Belgravia. No, in fact, I got to go and start packing my big old suitcase right now. See ya. So much for Christmas wishes. [chuckles] It isn't Christmas yet. [Stacy] I guess we're going to Belgravia! [Olivia] Wow, it's Clara's house from The Nutcracker. Yeah? Well, if the Mouse King shows up, I'm out of here. [giggles] [gasps] Hey, can we stop in town? They have a huge North Pole Christmas fair with Santa, with elves, with everything! And maybe we could even get some stockings for the fireplace. We're supposed to be at Wembley at noon to prep the kitchen. It wouldn't hurt to be a little early. Please! I mean, aren't you being a little, I don't know... neurotic? I am being organized, okay? We have a schedule. Let me see that. - See? It says "time to have fun." - Yeah. - Where? - Right there. In invisible ink.

I've got some more over here. Oh. I'm sorry. You look so familiar. I've heard that before. Well, you weren't in Chicago last week, were you? How could I have been in Chicago? [chuckles] They really go all out for Christmas here, huh? [old man] It's in honor of the royal wedding. The Prince is getting married to the Duchess of Montenaro - on New Year's Day. - Is she pretty? We haven't seen much of her. The Duchess is what you'd call camera-shy. Doesn't allow her picture to be taken. Well, maybe she's just a really private person. If you want to get a look, you might still catch her. I heard she was touring the set for the royal baking competition. Huh? ["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" playing] It's The Nutcracker. That's the Children's Ballet Conservatory. It would be so awesome to dance with them. - Maybe you can. - Really? I hear they have a summer program. Can we watch just for a little while? Please? Five minutes. You guys go ahead. I'll take care of this. Uh, one of each. [old man] Are you people in a hurry? Uh, I'm trying to get to Wembley a little early to set up for the competition. I'm one of the contestants. Well, you know what they say. Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans. That's the second time someone said that to me. Maybe you need to hear it. Right. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. [honks] Hey! Slow down! Would you watch where you're going? Who's yelling? A tourist, sir. Hmm. Probably from the States. Probably. [Stacy] Piping bag, prep spoons, rolling pan, sifter, and sauté pan. It is all here. Alphabetized the equipment list? Yeah, of course I did. I don't like the handle on this one. - Get a new one tomorrow? - Great. Stacy De Novo. What a surprise! Brianna Michaels. I didn't know you were going to be here. I won the competition last year. [Stacy] Oh! Well, congratulations. And what are you making for your pièce de résistance? Cheetos à la mode? Hey! I like Cheetos. - And you are? - Kevin Richards. I work with Stacy. Stacy and I went to Le Cordon Bleu together. Yeah, Brianna was really close to some of the faculty. They knew I had talent. Oh, yeah, like when you sauced Professor Kendall's berries? [chuckles sarcastically] [gasps] Oh, I'm so sorry. Let me help you. Thanks. I'm fine. Enchanté. - She seemed... - [Olivia] Mean? I better go clean up. - [woman] Oh! - I am so sorry. No problem. [both gasp] Who are you? Lady Margaret Delacourt, Duchess of Montenaro. - You're the one who's marrying the Prince? - Yes. Oh, right. You're here for that tour. Uh, look, I am really sorry for running into you. I'm usually not this messy, uh, but I'm one of the contestants at the baking contest, and there was an accident in the kitchen. I'm sorry. I'm Stacy De Novo, by the way. Nice to meet you. Oh! Miss De Novo. Did you say you were a baker? Uh, yeah. As a matter of fact, I have my own shop in Chicago. Well, as you know, I'm getting married, and I could really use an expert opinion on my wedding cake. From me? The Royal pastry chef here has a way of doing things, and I'm not sure they're to my liking. Well, when it comes to wedding cakes, the bride is always right. Precisely. I know it's short notice, but would you join me at the palace for a consultation later on today? A consultation? Wow! I would be so honored. - Shall we say in an hour or so? - An hour? Yeah, sure. I mean, I was going to go sightseeing with my friends, but I'm sure they'll understand if I tell them... Oh, no. You can't tell a soul about this. I wouldn't want to risk offending the King and Queen. Right, of course not. My lips are sealed. Brilliant. Great. Do I really need to bow or something before I go? It really isn't necessary. Great. I tested out the oven while you were gone, and it doesn't look like you had much luck with that stain. - Stain? - Your apron. [laughs] Right, my apron. Um, you know, I think the best thing to do would be to just go buy a new one. If you hang on a sec, I'll pack this stuff up, and we can all go together. No! What I mean is Olivia doesn't want to go shopping for some silly, old apron. Maybe you and I can watch some more of the ballet. And you can ask how much the summer program costs. Liv, you know we could never afford something like that. Meet you back at the cottage in an hour. Deal? Deal. Hey! [laughs] I really wish you and Stacy were a thing. Stacy and I have been friends since high school. If sparks were gonna fly, we'd know by now. Maybe you're just not trying hard enough. She's my best friend, Liv. You know that. Besides, she's just a little too intense for someone like me. People change. Not that much. [Mrs. Donatelli] It's uncanny. Do you think we could be related somehow? Three generations ago, your great-grandmother's cousin, Cecil, fled the country after a dalliance with a vulgar American divorcée. It was rumored that Cecil settled in the United States. His daughter married a man named De N'Ofrio, but the families lost touch. De N'Ofrio, De Novo... It could be. Stacy, I think we were destined to run into each other. Don't you? I don't know about destined... [chuckles] But I am so happy to help you with your cake. I do need a favor, but it has nothing to do with baked goods. What kind of a favor? Would you like some tea? Sure. I'm supposed to marry Prince Edward on New Year's Day, but I don't know anything about the people here or what a normal life here, or anywhere, is like. So, you want me to teach you how to be normal? No. I want to be you. I want to switch places with you. Switch places? I become you, and you become me. Get out! It would only be for two days. No one would even notice. I'm kind of guessing your fiancé would notice. Edward is leaving town tonight to meet with the Spanish Ambassador. He won't be back until the day after tomorrow. So, you wouldn't have to deal with him at all. You know, it doesn't sound like you're too excited about getting married. My parents taught me that marriage is about duty, about alliances between nations. Now that they're gone, I'm not going to disappoint them. So, what? It's, like, an arranged marriage? Edward and I met twice before we were engaged. It's not that he's unpleasant. He's just very... formal. Does he happen to have one of those fancy limousines? I believe so. Why do you ask? Not important. Look, the only thing on my schedule is breakfast with the King and Queen. You can spend the rest of your time relaxing right here. Please. If there's anything I could offer you... anything at all. You wouldn't happen to know anyone at the Children's Ballet Conservatory, would you? It's one of the Royal Charities. So if an adorable, eight-year-old ballerina wanted to do the summer program? It would be my pleasure to sponsor her. You really mean it? Consider it done. And I'd be back in time for the competition? We would switch back at midnight the night before. [sighs] I mean, if you really think it would help you out. So, you'll do it. They say life's what's happening when you're busy making other plans. Fabulous. - Okay, so... that is Chicago. - Wow! - There's my house. - So charming. There is Kevin. And little Olivia. Oh! How precious! [Stacy] There is the bakery. - Did you make that? - Yeah. - Very impressive. - Thank you. ["What Christmas Means to Me" plays] [gasps] So, the most important things to remember are, obviously, Edward. His father, George, and Caroline, his wife. Yes. Can't forget.

[Margaret] What do you think? Stacy De Novo. How's it hanging? - How's it hanging? - A bit much, is it? [knocking on door] - Who is it? - Edward. May I come in? Just one moment if you please. Do I really sound so Downtown Abbey? I don't know. I'm trying. Just... hide or something. Okay. Oh! Oh! Oh! What? Oh. Okay. Just a minute. [sighs] Ah! There you are! Here I am. [softly] Curtsy! Please do come in. Might I say you look lovely in pink. Oh! And you look lovely as well. Not in... Not in pink. Just... you know, in general. Though I'm sure pink would be very becoming. I'll take that as a compliment. I trust the accommodations are to your liking. Oh, yes, they're top drawer! Yes. But is there a problem with the sofa? No. No, no, not at all. You seem to keep staring at it. Oh, well... I have a lazy eye. - Oh. - [Stacy] Yes. Uh, not all the time. Just when I get fatigued. Perhaps it's not to your taste or not comfortable enough. Oh, no, no, it's very comfortable. Very comfortable indeed. In fact, I took a nap on it. Slept like a log. A log? Yes, dear, a royal log. It's an expression we have in Montenaro. A royal log? It's very quaint. Oh, well, we're a quaint, little country. But I don't want to keep you from Spain. Oh, yes, I... I suppose I should be heading off. Yes, off you go. Oh, and do tell your driver to be careful of pedestrians and other road hazards. Road hazards? [sighs] God! You were brilliant! [scoffs] I don't know about brilliant. Well, I do. With Edward away to stuffy, old meetings, all you need to do is stick to chatting about the weather. If you say so. Okay, now there is a sightseeing schedule in the back pocket of those jeans. All you need to do is follow it for the next two days. Right. Well, I suppose it's time. - Well, good luck. - You too. And thank you from the bottom of my heart. [exhales deeply] - Hey. - Hey. Olivia thought you got lost. She went to bed an hour ago. I was just taking in the sights. And there are a lot of sights to see. So, you get the apron? Apron. Right, the apron with the stain. Nope. Couldn't find one that fits. Stace, aprons are one-size-fits-all. Right. What I mean is I couldn't find one that fits... my personality. Did you get a haircut? Yes. Yup. Sure did. - Just out of the blue? - Yup. I've known you 12 years, you do not do out of the blue. There's a first time for everything. Well, it's getting late. I better catch some Z's. Good night. Good night. "Catch some Z's"? Does Lady Margaret really wear this to sleep? [chuckles] If you mean, does she wear a proper nightgown to bed instead of feety pajamas, then the answer is yes. So... I guess it's just you and me for the next two days. Indeed. Have you worked with a Duchess for a long time? - Since she was a little girl. - And you're okay with us trading places? [sighs] Well, the Duchess has always been rather spontaneous. And, uh, it's not my place to have an opinion. But you have one anyway. The dear girl has been through so much already. Losing both her parents so young, and now, all the responsibility of becoming a royal when she doesn't even really know who she is. The truth is I would do anything for her, which means that for the next two days, I will do anything for you. [clears throat] So, uh, should I bring you a fresh pot of tea? No, thanks. I think I'll be fine. Yes. I believe you will be. [sighs] [giggles] [laughs] Oh! [gasps] [laughs] Hello, darling. [giggles] [knocking on door] Mrs. Donatelli? [knocking on door] [Stacy] I'm coming! It's you again. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. No. No, not at all. Mrs. Donatelli went to fetch some tea, and in Montenaro, it's the custom to always wear a hat to tea. Even in one's nightgown? Yes, yes. There can be no exceptions, substitutions, or exchanges. - Excuse me? - Our code of etiquette was drafted by a rather fastidious attorney. Is there something I can do for you? Yes, I just wanted to say I hope you understand that I wish I could rearrange my schedule. I hate to leave at such short notice. I completely understand. Schedules are important to keep things organized. I couldn't agree more. - "A goal without a plan is..." - "Just a wish." Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. The Little Prince. One of my favorites. Mine too. Well, safe travels. Thank you. Oh. Really? So much to do, and so little time to do it. [King George] Hmm. - Mmm. - Ah. Please join us, dear. Your Majesties. [King George] I trust you slept well. Very well indeed. The weather is particularly splendid today, isn't it? Hmm. If one is a fan of frostbite. Oh. [Queen Caroline] I'm so glad to see you, my dear. I've been talking with chef about the menu for the reception. What about the menu? Prithee, tell. It's the salad course. Chef was thinking about a peanut sauce for salad dressing. But I seem to recall that one of your relatives is allergic. I just can't recall which one. My mother's side. The Pembrokes. Lord Percival? Didn't he die last spring? Mmm. Yes. Yes, he did. Suddenly, in fact. The dear thing. So we won't have to worry about poor Percy. You know? I never did like peanuts. Hmm. Well, then we'll find something else. Oh, you all right? Oh, yes. Just... surprised. I thought you'd be happy to see me. Of course. I just... Didn't you leave for your meeting with Spain last night? Edward had the good sense to turn around before he arrived at the airport. Yes, I thought it wrong to be concerned with affairs of state with our wedding just around the corner. And I'm determined to spend as much time together as we can over the next few days. How smashing! And now, you can both attend the St. Andrew's Shelter Charity Ball tonight. How doubly smashing! Which reminds me. I have something for you. Oh. Wow! I had it made for your engagement present. I hope it's suitable. It's... It's very suitable. Extremely suitable. [Prince Edward] Good. Well, in the meantime, I've spoken to Miles at the stables, - and he'll be ready for us in an hour. - Ready? For us to do what? I thought a nice ride through the countryside would be a fun surprise for you this morning. Oh! Isn't it too cold to go riding? - I thought you said you love the cold air. - I do. I... I do. But I'm worried about the horses. [laughs] The horses live in the stables. They're used to the cold. Well, of course they are, here. But not in Montenaro. It's much warmer back home. I thought you had a terrible snow storm last winter. We did. Terrible. Dreadful, really. But we have heated stables. Ah, well... [chuckles] - How very nice for the horses! - Yes, well, you know what they say. A warm horse is a happy horse. And there's nothing better than a happy horse. Hmm. Well, I better change if we're going riding. - Yes. - Yes, all right. - Frank? - Sir? I want you to keep a close eye on the Duchess. - She seems, um... - Different? Hmm. Different. Hmm. All right, we have our eggs, our pancakes. Should be enough. Breakfast is ready. You never burn anything. Uh, I guess I'm a bit nervous with the big contest coming up. Maybe we should eat out. - Splendid. - Splendid? Splendidly super. Stacy, what did you do to your hair? Oh, I got a trim. Thought I'd mix things up a little. Are you feeling okay? Super. Uh, will your father be joining us? [chuckles] Father went out to get that sauté pan, and he said he'd pick you up a new apron. Super-duper. So, where should we go? There was a place right on the square. Right. The square. Where we bought the Christmas tree, remember? Right! The Christmas tree. Tell you what, you get the coats, and I'll wash the dishes, deal? Deal. Secret handshake? [clears throat] [Margaret] Oh! [laughs] Hey! [giggles] Okay. [phone vibrates] Stacy, phone! [phone continues vibrating] [phone ringing] Oh, come on, Margaret. Pick up. [phone continues ringing] [clears throat] Was Your Grace having difficulty with her mobile telephone? Oh, no. It's nothing. Just a dropped signal. Would you like borrow mine? Oh, no. I wouldn't want to impose. Oh, it's no imposition. The Duchess is quite capable of placing her own calls, Mr. De Luca. I was just trying to be of service. Well then, you may take these to the laundry. It's that way. [quietly] The laundry. For God's sake! - Shall we? - We shall. Good. Oh, dear God! [chuckles awkwardly] Is there a problem? Not at all. It's just... The horses in Montenaro are a bit shorter, like large ponies. But... no problem. [laughs] None in the least. Here we go. - Are you all right? - Mm-hmm. I thought you said you were a competitive rider. Oh. Uh, I'm quite competitive indeed. [laughs] It's the pants. They must have shrunk in the royal wash. Huh. Wouldn't want to split a seam. All right, there we go. You know, we really don't have to do this. Oh, no. We are scheduled to go riding, so that's what we're going to do. - Well, then let me give you a hand. - All right. Ready? One, two, three. - Better? - Much. Good. Okay. Right. [clicking tongue] All right. Oh! Oh! [laughs] [Stacy chuckles awkwardly] [sighs] Here. Let me help you. I'm quite all right. Well, just in case. [giggles] You have something in your eye. This really is quite breathtaking. Yes. Yes, it is. I come here when I need to get away. Do you need to get away a lot? Sometimes the affairs of state can be a burden. Burdens usually aren't so bad when you have someone to share them with. [laughs] I doubt you'd be interested in the details of foreign trade. - Why not? - You shouldn't have to worry about that. Because I'm not bright enough? No, because you have a wedding to plan. So I should stick to things like polishing my tiara? No, I didn't mean it like that. Well, I think it's precisely what you meant. It's getting a bit chilly. I think it's time to head back. Margaret... [Stacy clicks tongue] [phone vibrates] Hello. Ugh! Boy, am I glad you picked up. [Margaret on phone] I was going to call you. There's been a bit of a snag at this end. What happened? Hey there, Princess. Oh! You figured us out! It wasn't rocket science. You okay with this, Liv? [Olivia on phone] You kidding? I get to hang with royalty. And Margaret told me all about that ballet scholarship, and that's so totally cool. I'm glad you're all right. Let me talk to Margaret. We're getting on fabulously. Well, that's great because things are not fabulous here. - [Margaret on phone] Why not? - Edward is back. Get out! I'm not kidding. [Margaret on phone] But he's supposed to be... Never mind where he's supposed to be. The fact is he came back to spend time with you, with me, with... I don't know, us? Oh, and you didn't tell me about the charity thing tonight. - Didn't I? - [Stacy on phone] No, you didn't. I suppose it must have slipped my mind. Well, you need to get back here pronto. I'm afraid I can't do that. - Why not? - With all the preparations for the ball, there's no possible way I could sneak in without someone seeing. Besides, it sounds like you're getting on famously. I vaulted over a horse! If Edward hasn't found out yet, we're in the clear. I don't know if I can keep this up. Oh, I must run. Ask Mrs. Donatelli for anything you need. Toodles. Wait. [sighs] [sighs] - I got the apron and the sauté pan. - Super. You decided to eat out? Stacy's decided she's gonna be spontaneous from now on. I'll believe that when I see it. - I mean it! - Okay. Then let's forget about that schedule of yours and just hang out. Super. You sure about that? [laughs] May I help you? The Prince would like to see the Duchess in the Portrait Library. I'll be sure to let her know. Oh, Mr. De Luca. Ms. Donatelli. These need to go to the kitchen. ["Joy to the World" playing] [laughs] Oops! What do you think? - It's pretty. - Let me see. Oh! Gorgeous! Okay. Huh? And what's that supposed to be? Rudolph! Rudolph the blood-sucking Reindeer? [laughs] Okay, smarty-pants, let me see yours. Christmas should be about love. I've never seen you so sentimental. Maybe you don't know me that well. [Santa Claus] Ho, ho, ho! [Olivia] Look, it's Santa! - Go for it. I'll wait for these to dry. - Come on! Does the heart good to see two people in love. Who, me? With her? Looks like a match made in heaven to me. We're just friends. I mean... She's not my type. I wouldn't be so sure. Go on, babe. Go. Hello. And what would you like for Christmas? Um, let me see. A new pair of ballet slippers, a skateboard, and oh, yeah, a new mom. [coughs] [laughs] [Santa Claus] I'll see what I can do. Smile for the camera. Wait. Let's all get in the picture. [Santa Claus] Oh, yes. [shutter clicks] She's very regal. That's my grandmother. Her necklace, is that a family crest? It's been passed down from generation to generation for over 300 years. That's a lot of generations. Granny was a bit of a rebel. She had an opinion on everything and wasn't afraid to let everyone know what it was. The palace wasn't used to it. She sounds like she was ahead of her time. Palace could use someone like her again. So, you wanted to see me? Yes, I did. Um... I believe I need to apologize. You believe you need to apologize. You're not certain. No, actually, I know I do. Apologies are important. The truth is when we were out there on horseback, I... [clears throat] ...was a complete and utter imbecile. You're going to be my wife. If you have an opinion on a matter of state, well, I'd like to hear what it is. Apology accepted. Glad to hear it. Margaret, I know how difficult this must be for you. We hardly know each other, but I want to make this marriage work. We have a... duty to make it work. Precisely. You know, there's something about you, something I hadn't really noticed before. I can't quite put my finger on it. Like my interest in foreign policy. Let's go with that. - If that's all? - Yes, that's all. Oh, please.

Who would like to hear the Duchess play? [crowd applauds] You can't say no. [exhales shakily] Stage fright? Something like that. How about we play a duet? "Carol of the Bells." You play the bells. I'll play the rest. - I don't know the chords. - Well, they're simple. It's these four notes. [plays notes] Right. [plays "Carol of the Bells"] - [song ends] - [crowd cheers and applauds] Bravo! Wasn't she wonderful? ["O Christmas Tree" plays on piano] [sighs] Have you seen the Duchess? I believe I saw Her Ladyship in the gazebo. Ah, thank you. May I just say, sir? The two of you make a fine couple. That's very kind of you. [Prince Edward] I've been looking for you. Edward, I hope you know I didn't mean to offend your parents by asking about the shelter. You didn't offend anyone. Maybe it'd be better if I didn't say anything at all. That would be dreadfully dull. In fact, I've arranged a carriage ride first thing in the morning, just the two of us, so you can spend more time talking, and I can spend more time listening. [chuckles] I don't think that's a very good idea. I think it's a fabulous idea. Speaking of fabulous ideas, they'll be expecting us to have the first dance. Oh, dear! I'm not very good at dancing. Well, you know what they say. Practice makes perfect. - Here? - Why not? ["It Came Upon the Midnight Clear" plays] So then what happened? [Margaret on phone] We were soaked to the skin. [Stacy on phone] Kevin can be so immature. He is very endearing. Kevin is like a puppy. If you're nice to him, he'll follow you anywhere. [chuckles] We're going sightseeing tomorrow. To see the St. Nicholas Fountain. Wait, but that wasn't in the schedule. Well, we threw out the schedule. Why would you throw out the schedule? [knocking on door] Yes? Hey. I forgot my toothpaste. Can I borrow yours? Sure. [laughing] Where is it? Everything okay? Yup. I'm great. - Good night. - Good night. Have you ever seen Kevin with his shirt off? Ew! Kevin? No. But Edward... Edward looked so good in a tuxedo. Edward was born in a tuxedo. So, you and Kevin aren't an item? No, there hasn't been anyone in his life since Olivia's mom left. Why do you wanna know? Just curious. Well, keep calm and carry on. [Stacy on phone] You too. [gasps] Whew! Quite hot! [carriage approaches] Milady. Off we go. So, now that I have you alone, you can tell me the truth. Uh, about what? Anything and everything. Oh. But how about we start with what you think about the charity work we're doing with St. Andrew's? [laughs] St. Andrew's! Of course. Well, if I'm being honest... Having a ball to raise money is a wonderful thing to do. But... But you really need to be more involved. - How? - Schedule a day to visit the shelter. Get to know the people. It's never been done before. Which means it needs to be done sooner than later. You sound like my grandmother. I'll take that as a compliment. "He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, and away they all flew like the down of a thistle." Isn't she wonderful? Reading to the children like that? The Duchess is very special. "And I heard him exclaim as he rose out of sight, 'Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.'" Yes? Is it true you're really a princess? Not yet. But I will be after I marry Prince Edward. Are you in love with him? [children giggle] Very much. I wish I could be a princess. The most important thing about being a princess is caring about other people. And if you do that, then you're a princess in your heart. Can we all please say, "Thank you, Lady Margaret" for her time here today? [in unison] Thank you, Lady Margaret! You're very welcome. Is that your Christmas tree? Yes, it is. Where are the presents? We don't have the budget for presents. What about the money from the ball? It is earmarked for the essentials: food, clothes. So the children don't get any toys? Toys are in short supply. But we usually manage to find a wee little something to pop in their stockings on Christmas morning. I trust it was a good visit? It was very educational. The families here don't have a real Christmas tree or presents for the children. Unless we do the shopping, and the wrapping, and the baking. You and I? Why not? You've already made the proper gesture, Your Grace. A gesture isn't what Christmas is about. We have the afternoon free. Well... It's a very ambitious undertaking. So I suppose we'd better get right to it. [squeals] Oh! Uh, sorry. That wasn't very dignified. It's all right. I liked it actually. Frank, the nearest toy emporium on the double. A toy emporium. Frederick's on Palmetto Road, Your Majesty. Frederick's. Palmetto Road. According to the guide book, the fountain is right up ahead. Can I get a candy cane? Yeah. There you go. Knock yourself out. [chuckles] You know, there is a legend that says the St. Nicholas Fountain never freezes because of the warmth of the Christmas spirit. I'm guessing there's an underground spring. Well, I like the legend better. You know what? So do I. [chuckles] [man] Excuse me? Are you Stacy De Novo? Yes. Yes, I am. Adam Delaney, Food Insider Magazine. I heard about your bakery in Chicago. I'd love to do a feature on you. Hello! Brianna Michaels. I won the competition last year. Great. So the buzz is you're the one to beat this year. Oh, well, uh, it's not just me. We are a team. This is Kevin, my very talented sous-chef. Kevin. Can I get your full name please? Yeah, sure. I'm Kevin Richards. [Delaney] And how long have you been a team? - [Kevin] A long time now. - [Stacy] Very. [Prince Edward] This is nice. [Prince Edward and Stacy laugh] Oh, very nice. [gasps] I always wanted one of these. - [laughs] - [gun sounds] My parents never let me have one. Well, what's wrong with saving the Earth from an alien invasion? If you're going to save the Earth from an alien invasion, you should probably do it by diplomacy not warfare. - [scoffs] - [gun sounds] Yes. We'll need about a dozen. Ooh! And a few of these as well. Edward, look what they have. Ooh! It's a mat with... large colored circles. [laughs] You've never played Twister before? Ah, it's a game. Take off your shoes this instant. - [chuckles] - Now. [giggles] Has the Duchess always been so different? Tell me, has the Prince always been so... ordinary? You're hiding something. I'm gonna find out what it is. You're going to be looking for a long, long time. [Stacy and Prince Edward laughing] Right hand red. [both laughing] So, that's how you do things in Montenaro. It was nice of you to let me do that interview. Well, you deserve it. Guys, come look! It's a toy store! I've never been in a toy store. What? Um, what she means is she's never been to a "Belgravian" toy store. Oh. - [Olivia] Come on! - Lead the way! All right. Oh, wow! Geez Louise! Excuse me? My earring from Aunt Louise, it's gone! Yes, yes. Maybe look over there. - I changed my mind. Let's go see Santa. - Yeah! - We just saw Santa. - Yeah, but he and I didn't go deep. Oh! Oh, my goodness! I feel so... so faint! First, you wanna go shopping. Now, you wanna see Santa. What's going on with you? Come on, Liv. Spill. Excuse me. Sorry to be a bother. My car has run out of petrol. The station is down the street, but I can't push it myself. Think you could give an old man a hand? Of course we can. - Yes, here we go. - Just hot. Thank you. Wait a second. I know you. On the square in town, you had one of those booths. Closed early today. Rheumatism's acting up. The car's right outside. Great! Let's go. Okay. Oh, wait! I see it. - Here it is. - Ah! - Yes. Close one. - Right. - Cooled down? - Yes. There we go. I feel much better now. It's fine. Here. Try this. [chuckles] Where did a Duchess learn to bake like this? My father. Your father? The Grand Duke of Montenaro baked cookies? Best cookies in the world. You miss him, don't you? I'm generally not the sentimental type, but doing things like this helps keep a piece of the past alive. [Prince Edward] Yes, I know what you mean. I used to love the smell of turkey roasting at Christmas. It meant my cousins were coming over to play. That was a long time ago. It's still all right to play sometimes. [Prince Edward chuckles wryly] Not so sure about that. Well, I am. [Prince Edward] All right. - [laughs] Here. - Okay. Hang on. I think there's a couple more. I wrapped that one. Your Highness wrapped the presents himself? - Really? - A few. With a little help. Taking the time to wrap a gift is part of the gift itself. It's what we say in Montenaro anyway. Well, it's not very dignified for a royal. It's always dignified to be kind, Frank. - Right. Shall we? - Yes. - Do you see what's going on out there? - I do. [King George] I don't like it. There's something about that girl. George! She's a breath of fresh air. And it seems your son is falling in love with her. Yes. Well, I suppose that's all that matters. You know that's all that matters.

Good. We need someone to defend our galaxy. When diplomacy fails. Look! I really am a princess! Your Majesty! Your Royal Highness and Lady Margaret have given us so much this Christmas. Well, it was all the Duchess's idea. Well, it was a very gracious gesture. That's just it. Christmas is about more than just a gesture, which is why I've decided that Lady Margaret and I are going to make it a tradition to come here once a month and get to know you all. That's wonderful. Excuse me. You're standing under the mistletoe. [Mrs. McBride] Oh! Ah, so we are! - Who wants to go play Twister? - Twister? My favorite. Come on, Frank. That's not really in my job description, sir. It is now. Come on. Oh! That was the best spaghetti I've ever had. Since you're doing the heavy lifting at the competition tomorrow, I figured it's the least I could do. - So, are we going out tonight? - Ooh! - You're going to bed. - [grumbles] We have an early start tomorrow. We got to be at Wembley by 8:00. - But... - Pajamas. Now. Can Stacy tuck me in? Sure. She never runs out of energy, does she? Her mom was like that. Do you miss her mother? - You know me better than that, Stace. - [chuckles] Karen and I weren't meant to be. Like you and Paul. Well, you're right. We weren't. [knocks] So I guess you're leaving tonight. I don't have a choice. I wish you could stay. I wish I could too. But you'll have Stacy back, and I must get on with my duty. Which means you have to do things even if you don't want to do them? Something like that. That's not fair. It's complicated, but I'll never forget you and your father. You'll always be special to me. But you're meant to be here. I'm afraid I don't get to decide things like that. You should. [sighs] You know, I think this trip has done you a lot of good. - You do? - I mean, it's almost like you're not the same person. [laughs] - Please! - No, I mean it. There's just something less... intense about you. I don't know. Just being here, making Christmas ornaments, singing carols. I mean, all those little moments with you. It's what life's really about. That is the nicest thing you've ever said to me. Well, it's true. So... - Wanna watch a Christmas movie? - Sure. Which one? The... one with Santa. Stace, they all got Santa. [chuckles] [laughs] Right. Then you choose. [Kevin] This one. Ooh! Your favorite? - No, it's your favorite. - Right. I was just messing with you. I'll pop the corn. [Prince Edward] I've learned so much from you. Like how to bake cookies and wrap presents? Like how to understand people and how to reach out to them. You have a good heart, Edward. You're going to do just fine. As long as you're here to help me. Well, I suppose it's time to turn in. I wanted to give you something. Didn't have time to wrap it, but... probably for the best. "Veritas, Anoris, Amare." "Truth, honor, and... love." The family crest. The one from the painting. It belonged to your grandmother. Margaret, if I'm being truthful... I was worried about us, about the wedding, about... - not knowing who you are. - Yeah. But after today, I'm not worried anymore. You really are Prince Charming. I... - Did I do something wrong? - No. No, you did everything right. Well, then I'll see you in the morning. You will see your Duchess in the morning. [sniffles] There is nothing like a happy ending to make someone cry. Endings usually aren't very happy. Hey, what is it, Stace? I don't know. Just feeling sentimental again. Must be the movie. Well, speaking of sentimental... Don't kill me. I got you a little something. But it's not Christmas yet. - It's not for Christmas. - Then what's it for? It's in your stocking. Open it. What do you think? It's the most beautiful gift I've ever received. Thank you so much. May I? Look, I know... we've been friends for so long. But these last few days, I... I felt like it could be more. At least... to me. I think you felt it too. - Something wrong? - No. Yes. I mean, it's me. I should not have done that. - It's okay. - No, it's... It's not. Can we just pretend this never happened? Why? Please, you just have to trust me on this. Yeah, sure. Whatever you say. Thank you. Good night. Good night. [clock chiming] [knocking on door] I will be right outside. Thank you. [Stacy] So, did you get to do everything you wanted? Almost. And you and Edward got on all right? Yeah. Everything's set for your wedding. Splendid. You know, Edward's really special. He's thoughtful. He's kind. Your friend Kevin is the real prince. No, Kevin is just Kevin. He's one in a million. No, Edward is the one who... You're in love with Edward! And you're in love with Kevin! Oh! Well, this wasn't supposed to happen. No, it wasn't. So, what do we do? Nothing. You go back to being the Duchess, and I hop on a plane back to Chicago as soon as the competition's over. Oh, I believe this belongs to you. [shutter clicking] What? [shutter clicking] Whoa! [yells] [sighs with satisfaction] Ow! Is it really you? [chuckles] It's really me. [chuckles] [laughs] It really is you. Well, do you have to sound so disappointed? No, no, no. I'm really glad that you're back. It's just I really wish Margaret didn't have to go. And now she has to marry that creepy, old prince who probably smells like mothballs. Okay, first of all, the Prince does not smell like mothballs, and he's definitely not creepy. Then what was he? Dreamy. Sweet. [chuckles] Funny. Sounds like someone's crushing big time on Prince Mothballs. Look, all I know is we have got a big competition today, which means... we need to focus, okay? Yes? I have urgent business with the King. Anything that concerns the King concerns me as well. It's a very delicate matter. I really should speak to His Royal Highness directly. I see. It would be such a shame to lose one's job right before Christmas, wouldn't it? - But... - Hand me the envelope, Frank. But it's... Or would you prefer to hand in your resignation? No. No. Your Majesty. Oh, and, Frank, there seems to be a plumbing problem in the privy next to the study. Would you mind taking a look? It would be my great honor, Your Majesty. - Your bath is ready, Your Grace. - Thank you. Forgive me for speaking plainly, but that doesn't sound like a very happy bride-to-be. My happiness isn't what matters. It's my duty. Oh, before I forget, Miss De Novo gave me this to give to you. It's a gift from Edward. "Veritas, Anoris, Amare." "Truth, honor, and love." Funny thing, it doesn't say a word about duty. Remarkable. A remarkable resemblance, wouldn't you say? Apparently, she's a baker at the competition in Wembley. Looks like a princess to me. [show host] Ladies and gentlemen, if you could please find your places and make way to your seats. The competition is about to begin. - Looks like we're good to go. - Great. Stace, about last night... Let's just talk about it on the plane, okay? - Yeah. - Cool. Good afternoon, and welcome to Belgravia's 56th Annual International Christmas Baking Competition. The finest bakers from around the world will have five hours to prepare the most spectacular Christmas cake. Only one will be crowned winner. And the competition begins... now. Darling! And how is the blushing bride-to-be? Very well, Your Majesty. Edward has been telling us about your adventure at the shelter yesterday. I understand you made a lot of people very happy. She was magnificent, a born leader. I must say I'm very impressed. Thank you, Your Highness. You know, I'm feeling a bit under the weather. - I hope it's nothing serious. - No, it's just a bit of fatigue. Edward, would you be a dove and take my place with Margaret at the baking competition today? I'm supposed to be handing out some ribbons, and I don't think I have the strength. Oh, yes, we'd be glad to. Something wrong, my dear? I... I don't know if we have the time. Of course we have the time. But the wedding... I would imagine the staff has everything under control. Will you excuse me for a moment? More gold! More sparkles. This isn't a funeral. It's Christmas! - We're gonna need more poinsettias. - I'm on it! Those layers cool yet? Uh... Needs five more minutes. - I'm gonna start on the filling. - Yeah. Kevin? [Kevin] Jeez! How am I supposed to puree the berries? You're gonna have to do it by hand. - You got this, okay? - Okay. Yeah, we're good. I've been looking all over for you. I needed some fresh air. Oh. Well, I was worried about you. Please don't. Look, Margaret, I don't know what's wrong. Whatever it is, if you don't want to hand out a bunch of silly ribbons, just say so. We don't have to. No, we have to go. But... There's something I need to tell you first. Sounds serious. Well, it is. It's about truth and honor. But mostly, it's about love. [show host] Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one... Time is up. Well done. Frank, we need to get to Wembley on the double. - Now this should be interesting. - Oh, shut it, Frank. It's incredible presentation. And your sugar work is commendable. Thank you, judge. [judge] The filling is interesting. The puree isn't as smooth as I'd hoped. But it has a wonderful flavor. Nicely done. The judges have reached a decision. In third place... is Zachary Brachmann of Munich, Germany. Well done, Zachary. In second place is... Is Brianna Michaels of Beverly Hills, USA. Well done, Brianna. Okay. who's next? And in first place, the winner of the 56th Annual International Christmas Baking Competition is... Stacy De Novo, Chicago, USA. Well done, Stacy. Now, since Queen Caroline was unable to attend today's ceremony, presenting the award... is Prince Edward of Belgravia and his fiancée, Duchess Margaret of Montenaro. Now if the winners would like to please join me on stage for the awards ceremony. Thank you. You know, who needs a silly medal? I think we should go. Are you crazy? Stace, this is our moment. Yeah, but we're gonna be late for the plane, so... I'm going up there, and you're coming with me. [show host] Ladies and gentlemen, Prince Edward and Duchess Margaret. [crowd applauding] And here it goes. What's going on? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Try me. I think I can explain. There's... - There's two of you? - No. No. But we think that we may be related through some great, great someone in-law. - Cousin Cecil. - Yeah. I think we need a moment to ourselves. - Maybe let's go backstage. - Perfect. [Stacy] Let's go. Can someone please explain what's going on? This is my fault. How's that? All I wanted to do was to get to know what it was like to be a normal girl. Even if it was only for a few days. When I saw Stacy, the idea just came to me. - You two switched places? - Yeah. You've been with Margaret for the past two days. And Stacy has been with the Prince. I'm sorry. I didn't think things would get so complicated. Complicated is an interesting word for it. But there's more. How can there be more? I like being normal. I hate being in the spotlight. Edward needs a partner who likes taking charge, who has a good heart. Someone who is meant to be a princess. Someone like Stacy. Wait. Me? I didn't plan any of this, but I suppose I found out I'm just a normal girl. And normal girls, they fall in love with normal boys. Like you. - But you're not Stacy. You're... - Margaret Delacourt, Duchess of Montenaro. Aren't you supposed to marry the Prince? I know this is a little confusing, but... Lady Margaret is trying to say that she's in love with you. Oh! Doesn't that kind of piss you off? Not at all, actually. Because I'm in love with her. Stacy brings out the best in me. The way you bring out the best in me. You're not mad at me? At us? If all of this ends with me getting to be with the woman that I love, I am very happy. I intend to keep being happy for the rest of my life. No. Edward, I... I can't let you do this. Stacy. Stacy, wait! We need to talk. How about we do it over a movie and hot chocolate? It's a date. [Olivia] Kiss her, Daddy! Stacy, wait! Please, stop. Edward, you can't be in love with me. - Says who? - It isn't right. Okay, things happen according to plan. Life happens according to plan, and this... This is not the way it was planned. - So you're saying you don't love me. - No, that's not what I'm saying. I love you more than I've ever loved anyone in my whole life. Then I'm not giving you up without a fight. I'm not a duchess or a princess. I'm a baker from Chicago. You can still be a baker from Chicago. We'll pick up your shop, and we'll move it here. [Stacy] No, you can't do that. Then you can open up another shop here. You can bake to your heart's content. As long as we're together. This is crazy. No, it's not. Don't you understand? Stacy, you're my destiny. This was the plan. We were meant to be together. You can't really be serious. [crowd gasps] Stacy De Novo, if you're still in love with me a year from today, will you marry me next Christmas? Of course I'll marry you. Yes! Yeah! [crowd cheers] [crowd cheers and applauds] Yes, sweetheart? You're a real princess now, aren't you? She is indeed. I guess Christmas wishes really do come true. Aren't you going to throw the bouquet? Oh! [giggles] [gasps] [laughs] Marvelous. Marvelous. So, what are you doing New Year's? I don't have any plans. Why? You might want to hang on to that. Mm-hmm? A very merry Christmas to one... and to all! [all] Merry Christmas! [giggles] Whoo!
