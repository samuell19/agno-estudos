OWEN: Are you ready, Ben? BEN: Yeah, go ahead. The camera's on. Look at the camera, Son. My name is Cameron Lansing, and it's the 14th day, and it's 9:00 AM, and I'm here with Professor Majors, and my dad, Owen Lansing. And I'm about to do my marble test. The, uh, following experiments will test Cameron's telekinetic abilities. Now, these abilities were first noticed when Cameron was seven years old, and when he was playing alone with his toys. Square. It became more apparent over the last three years. In attempting to explore the limits of Cameron's special skills, my associate, Ben Majors and I have been conducting these various tests under isolated conditions. Hello, Cameron. Can I play with this? [WIND HOWLING] [CREAKING] CAMERON: Be careful, Champion. He's gonna get you. [GRUFFLY] Don't worry, I can handle it. Do you think he can make himself different? He can fool you. Oh, no! It is Deceptor. Waste him, Champion. [GRUFFLY] We can't be sure. He'll trick you. CAMERON: Be careful, Champion. You never know where Deceptor is hiding. There he is, Champion, get him! [GRUFFLY] You'll never get me, Champion. I am Deceptor. The prince of evil. [LAUGHING] So you think. [GRUFFLY] You'll never get me again. Oh, no? Watch me. [ANIMAL HOWLING] There you are. Gonna get you again. [SIGHS] Cameron. What are you doing? Just playing. No, Cameron. Come with me. Now tell me something. Who were you talking to? I was playing with my friends. And? I didn't mean anything. It doesn't matter what you meant. I told you you mustn't do this. It's dangerous. These... These games are not real. It's gone too far. But you taught me... It doesn't matter what... I taught you too much. What are you gonna do? I'm sorry, Dad. I'll never do it again. I promise. I want you to relax now like I showed you. Take deep breaths. Let go of everything. Think of the lake. Our lake. OWEN: Calm, quiet. Think of a bird. Beautiful bird gliding. Coming down gently. Gently to the water. Glide down with that bird, Cameron. Down. Gently down. God forgive me. [PHONE RINGING] BEN: This is Benjamin Majors. Please leave your name, your number and a message at the tone. [BEEPS] If you're there, Ben, pick up the phone. OWEN: I know you're there, Ben. Listen, I'm afraid. I believe you now. I read the book. You were right. It's here, Ben. The evil is here. I'm... I'm gonna stop it tonight. You still have the tape. Destroy it, Ben. It's over. [SIGHS] Destroy the tape. I don't want any record of this. [BEN SIGHS] BEN: Oh, God. I am awfully sorry for having offended Thee. And I confess all my sins because I fear the laws of heaven and the banes of hell. Most of all because they are offending Thee, O God, who art all good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace, to confess my sins, to do penance and to better my life. Amen. [OWEN GRUNTS] [RATTLING] Cameron? [YELLS] [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Yes. What? When? Cameron. Is Cameron all right? Thank God. Yes, he... Yes, I will. Thank you. What? Who the hell's calling this late? An accident. My ex-husband's dead. [CAR HORNS HONKING] Hey, look, I'll go around back, you keep your eyes open. If he comes this way, you grab him. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. [DOOR SHUTS] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [DOOR CLICKS] [GUN CLICKS] [YELLING] Sam, what's the matter? What? Didn't you see him? What? I chased the sucker outside. He came out over there. What the hell's the matter with you? Uh, I think I fell asleep. [PANTING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] DORY: What do you think? It's nice. Can I get my stuff? Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure, sport. Here you go. Hey, hey, hey, easy on the car, kid. This is my car. DORY: Go on in. Go ahead. It's your room now, Cameron. How do you like it? It's okay. It'll look great once you get everything moved in. Does he live here? Bob? Yeah, until he finds a place of his own. Oh. Hey, look, this isn't easy for me either. I got a great idea. Let's go downstairs. I'll make us some lunch. BOB: Sounds good to me. Where do you want these, sport? Uh, just put 'em down by the bed, uh, I'll unpack later. Okay. Hey, hey, hey. Give me a kiss, hmm? NAVARRO: You fell asleep? For Christ's sake, Sam. Captain, I... You're a good cop, I know that. What's going on? What's the problem? Was Pete Groom talkin' to you? He's your partner, Sam. He's worried about you. It's nothing. I just... I... I don't sleep too good. Well, it may be nothing to you, but it's a problem for me. Especially if your partner gets his ass shot off. What do you need? Some time off? No. [SIGHS] But I want you to go see Dr. Haley. Who's that? A psychologist. And a good one. Works for the department. I already gave the phone number to Groom. Look, there's nothing wrong with my head. Maybe I didn't make this clear, Sergeant Taliaferro. This is not merely a suggestion. [MUSIC PLAYING] How you doing? Good. Shit. [HUMMING] Guess what I found on my car? A scratch. I didn't do it. You didn't do it, huh? Well, maybe this had something to do with it. I think I'll hold onto it for a while, just in case. [SIGHS] What're you doing there, sport? None of your business. Well... The way I see it, since you're living in my house, everything that goes on is my business. It's my mom's house, not yours. Whatever you say, kid. Now I'm gonna marry your mom. What do you think of that? Have you asked her yet? I'm gettin' around to it. Mom's too smart for that. She'll never go for it. [GRUNTS] Who do you think you're talking to? You're gonna watch your mouth around me, and show a little respect. Get that look off your face. Nobody asked you to come live here. You got it? [WHISPERING] Bam, bam, bam. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Sam, how are ya? Hey, how you doing? Ed. Jesus, how are you doing? Fine, fine. You know, I'm gettin' it all together now. That's great, Ed. It was a little rough in the beginning there for a while. I had all those problems with my wife and my mother, and, uh, you know, I shot myself in the foot. And then, uh, now I'm hearing these voices. I'm hearing voices telling me to go fuck myself. Isn't that crazy? Yeah. You ever hear voices? Uh, no. Are you here to get your head shrunk, too? Oh, no, no. This... It's a social call. I'm a friend of the family. Oh. Take care, Ed. All right, see you, Sam. Good morning. Hi. I'm, uh, here to see Dr. Haley. Sergeant Taliaferro? Yeah. I'm Dr. Haley. Nice to meet you. Have a seat, please. [CLEARS THROAT] Why are you here? 'Cause my captain sent me. How can I help you? I don't have any idea. It says here that you're experiencing occasional periods of, well, absent-mindedness on the job. Oh, it says that there? Well... I just, uh... I just don't sleep too well. NORA: Insomnia? No. Bad dreams. How long have you been having them? Look, I'm not like that nut who just left here, okay? [SIGHS] I don't know how to explain them. They're, uh... They're... They're weird. I just, uh... It's always the same. I'm chasing somebody, I'm chasing something. [SIGHS] I don't know. It's just... They don't make any sense. They don't have to. Dreams are interpretive, not literal. I mean, it's often just our subconscious talking to us. It's a reflection of our problems. I don't have problems. I have bad dreams. You're not comfortable being here, are you? No, no, I'm not. Look, I can't do this. Why don't you let me help you? Because where I come from, we were taught to help ourselves. I got to go. [BOB EXHALING] [BOB GRUNTING] [SIGHS] BOB: Just give me the first couple of words, please. This was... BOB: Okay, okay. This was the noblest Roman of them all. Of all these... Shit! [LAUGHS] [LAUGHING] Does your son have to be down here while I'm working? BOB: This is important to me. Honey, can you go back to bed? It's late. I can't sleep. I hear funny noises. Cameron, just try, please? [WHOOSHING] You know, I look like him. I saw this picture once of Mark Anthony in a book. I was born to play this part. Why don't we pack it in for tonight? You know, your attitude really sucks. This is important to me. [RUSTLING] [WHOOSHING] You hear that? Why can't your kid just go to sleep like other kids? Lighten up, Bob. No, you lighten up. Your kid is upstairs talking to himself. For Christ's sake, he's only 10 years old. Would you leave him alone? I'm gonna talk to him. Obviously you're not. [WHOOSHING] What do you want? Who are you? Hey, you got a real problem, kid. Only crazy people talk to themselves. I wasn't talking to myself. You weren't, huh? Who were you talking to then? Someone in my closet. Someone in your closet. [SIGHS] Listen, kid. Your mom and I are trying to work downstairs. When you make noises up here, you blow my concentration. Are you listening to me? Mmm-hmm. Good. Good. Now we have an understanding, don't we? Don't we? Let's go to sleep. Let's go. Good night. This was the noblest... [MUSIC PLAYING] CAMERON: What do you want? Oh, what the hell? Come on. What did I tell you, huh? What did I tell you, huh? Now you get in bed before I throw you out the window. Leave me alone! You're not my father! You're lucky I'm not your father. You stay in that damn bed. What's in there, huh? What are you hiding in the closet, anyway? No, Bob, get away from there! [ROARING] No, Bob! [SCREAMING] [SIREN WAILING] [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] So what have we got? We got a dead male Caucasian, about 30. License says his name is Bob Froelich. He carries a SAG card, so he's probably an actor. Well, out here who isn't? Any witnesses? There's a woman and kid in the house. But neither one said much. Joe Crespy is with the victim, Sergeant. Check inside, Pete. PETE: Right. [CAMERA CLICKING] Hey, how's it going, Joe? What the hell happened? Did he fall out of an airplane or what? Yeah. One launched out of that window. SAM: Huh. That doesn't seem possible, does it? You're the detective. Want to see the body? [SIGHS] It's the damnedest thing, Sam. His eyes are burned out. Never saw anything like it. Neither did he. Toni Falconer, local news. Right. Now, I know who you are. Sergeant, what can you tell us about tonight's killing? MAN: Do you suspect any foul play? TONI: Are there any suspects in custody? What time did the killing occur? What did the coroner say, huh? Have you discovered the motive? The coroner said the man's dead. Did the victim, a live-in boyfriend... What do I know? I just got here, okay? Sarge, I understand there's a little boy up there. Will you do me a favor? Will you let go of my arm? Thank you. TONI: Kill it, guys. Hey. Mrs. Lansing? Yes. Hi, I'm Sergeant Taliaferro. L.A.P.D. Homicide Division. You feel up to talking? Doctor just gave her something. She's a little shaky. DORY: It's all right, Alan. This is my brother, Sergeant. I... I don't know what happened. One minute Bob was here. The next minute he went up to Cameron's room, and... Cameron's your little boy? Yes. So where is Cameron now? He's upstairs in my bedroom with the doctor. Okay. You can put your shirt down now. How we doing? I'm all done here, Sam. He's okay. Thanks. Hi. How are you doing? You must be Cameron, huh? I'm Sergeant Taliaferro. So this is your room, huh? Kind of a sports fan, aren't you? You got a favorite team? I like baseball myself. So you were in here tonight, huh? You're not going to arrest me, are you? I didn't do anything. Of course I'm not going to arrest you. I think maybe you can help me, Cameron. You tell me everything you saw and everything you heard, anything that you can remember. Was there somebody else in here tonight? I'm not sure. Did he fall out the window? It was dark. I didn't see. Mind if I come in? Hello, Sergeant. This is a crime scene, Dr. Haley. I'm authorized. I've been assigned by your captain. Hi there. Mind if I finish my work first? Do you mind if I listen? Yeah, yeah, I do. Cameron, why don't you go with Dr. Haley for a minute and I'll catch up with you later, okay? Come on. Find anything? Nah. NORA: Has anyone notified next-of-kin? Uh, no, he... He didn't have anyone. Will you and Cameron be all right? ALAN: Well, I'm staying here tonight. Tomorrow, well, I'll have to see. NORA: Well, that's good. I mean, given tonight's trauma, someone should be here. I mean, the boy's at a very tender age. An accident of this kind could have a lasting effect. Uh, Mrs. Lansing, would it be all right with you if I saw Cameron in my office tomorrow? Why, is there something wrong? Oh, no, no. It's... It's fine. It's just that it's a lot for a little boy to handle and I might be able to help him. I see. Okay. Thank you. Sure. Good night. Good night. So are you finally finished up there? I can go up now? Don't you think he's had enough for one day? Give him a break, huh? [MUSIC PLAYING] [STATIONS CHANGING] MAN: Sports today. The Braves shut out the Reds, four to nothing. The Dodgers moved up a game in the West by besting the Giants 10 to nine in front of a capacity crowd in Windy Candlestick Park. In American League Action, the Angels squeaked by the Kansas City Royals... [TIRES SCREECHING] BOY: Sam. Come with me, Sam. Come with me. [YELLING] [PHONE RINGING] Yeah. NAVARRO: Sam, what the hell's going on? Oh, hello, Captain. Do you know what time it is? Yeah, right. Um, I must have overslept. You get in here right away, understand? I want you in my office. Okay, yeah. Yeah, right away. CAMERON: I don't know what you want me to talk about. Anything you feel like. I didn't kill Bob. Well, of course you didn't, Cameron. But in a way, I did. Tell me about it. I wanted him gone. A lot of us feel that way about people. And that's okay. [SIGHS] What did happen, Cameron? It was dark. I didn't see. MAN: Come on, let's go, boys. Over there in the corner. Don't cook. I'll eat out. What's this? Pornography. Guy with the hat's the producer. This is the director. What about Nora Haley? What? What about her? I kept my appointment. Don't bullshit me, Sam. I'm talkin' about last night. State law requires a psychologist be assigned to all cases involving children. If you can't work with her, I'll put somebody else on it. You got that? Understood, Captain. Do you remember when we were all in the living room last night, and you were sitting in the chair? I guess so. I saw something then. Something very strange. Yeah. You know what I mean. The vase? What vase? Cameron, I saw what you did. You can tell me, it's okay. So what did you come up with here? Well, the brother's alibi checked out. Nobody has a clue about Froelich's eyes. Oh, but get this. Dory Lansing's ex-husband was found dead a couple of months ago. The official cause of death was an accident. Do you know how he died, Talia? He was decapitated. And guess where they found it? In the kid's closet. I got to go. CAMERON: You know what? That sergeant's coming over. The one with the funny name. Sergeant Taliaferro? How do you know that, Cameron? I just know things. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Hi. Hi. Am I interrupting? Uh, no, no. I'm just a little surprised. Uh, come in. Hiya, kid. Hi, Sergeant Tala... That's okay. Just call me Sam. Hey, I, um... I got you something. Wow! The Rams. Thanks, Sam. So, how is everything going here? Fine, fine. Things are going well. Uh, Cameron here knew you were stopping by. Yeah, so did you. But I didn't tell him. Oh, so what is he, psychic? Exactly. [CHILDREN TALKING] MAN: Come on, come on! Here you go. You know, when I was your age, that was the only thing I would eat. Ever hear of Coney Island? No. They had the best hot dogs in the world and the biggest roller coaster you ever saw. Roller coaster, sounds like fun. I've never been on one of those. What, are you kidding? Your dad never took you to an amusement park? Yeah, well, you know, my dad never took me either. I used to go by myself and I'd sneak in. Don't get any ideas. Maybe I'll take you sometime. Really? Yeah. Is that a deal? It's a deal. Hey, Cameron. I found this in your room. What is this? Mmm, that's Deceptor. Well, that's what I call him. Where did you get it? My father said I could play with it. So this is the, uh, make-believe friend you told Dr. Haley about? Mmm-hmm. So don't you have any real friends who come visit you? Not really. Well, I'm your friend. I'll come visit you. Sam, are you as tough... You know, like the cops on TV? Tougher. That's good. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [WHOOSHING] [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] [DOORBELL RINGS] Hi. Hello. I just... I was in the neighborhood. I thought I'd stop by. Thought, uh, maybe we should talk. Uh, you know, about Cameron. Come in. [SIGHS] Nice place. Thanks. This is kind of funny. I don't usually fraternize with patients. Would you like some Thai food? I'm not a patient. And no thanks, I don't like Thai food. Okay. How about a drink? No, look, really, I can't stay. What about Cameron? No. No, I lied. It's not about Cameron. [SNIFFS] It's me. I, uh... I've gone out of control. The dreams again? They don't stop. Listen to me, whoever you are, I want you outta here. You killed Bob and my father. Well, you won't get me 'cause I got someone who'll protect me. [ROARING] Help! Mom! No! Mom, help! No, no! [SCREAMING] No! No! Mom! Cameron? [CAMERON SCREAMING] Cameron! Cameron! Cameron! No! Come on! Open the door! Cameron! Mom, help me! Cameron! Cameron! Cameron! Cameron! Cameron! Stop it! Leave me alone! You're not real! Stop! [GRUNTS] [PANTING] MALE DISPATCHER: One Adam Niner, respond to a 415 reported at 337 Pressfield. Code two. [TIRES SCREECHING] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] Hello. Hello. [LATCH OPENING] Hello? [DOOR CREAKING] Anybody home? [WHOOSHING] [PETE SCREAMING] DORY: I took Cameron away from there as fast as I could. It's in that house. Whatever it was that killed Bob is trying to get Cameron. It is in that house. Dory, I don't think it has anything to do with the house. What do you think? I'm crazy? How well do you know Cameron? What do you mean? Are you aware that he has telekinetic abilities? I gotta go to work. Are you gonna be all right? Uh, yeah. Okay, bye. CAMERON: Sam, I'm afraid. Afraid of what? I'm not sure. I don't know. Well, don't be afraid. You know I'll protect you. Deal? Do you anything about the work your husband was doing with Cameron? Cameron never wanted to talk about it. Is there anything you could think of that would help? When we were moving Cameron in, I found a box of research notes. I tried to give them back to his partner, but, uh... Partner? Ben Majors. That's funny. That's Pete's car. I wonder what he's doing here. Pete! Pete! This is where Dory said Owen Lansing's papers would be. Sam, look at this. Sam. What're you doing? Uh, nothin'. Let's get out of here. Sam, I don't like this. Hey, I don't either. You really like Sergeant Taliaferro, don't you? He told me he'd protect me. He told me he would. Don't worry, honey. No one's gonna hurt you. Mom. Yeah? I don't wanna ever go back to the house. You don't ever have to. Uncle Alan's planned a little trip for us. It's all been arranged. We're leaving tomorrow. I won't let anything happen to you. I promise. [BIRDS CHIRPING] I think this is it. So, uh, where does this guy live, up a tree? No, he's in a cabin. It's not far. I don't see any cabin. It's supposed to be up this trail. Okay. Are you grouchy because I drove? No, you did very well. Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm just worried about my partner. Nobody's heard from him. Why would anybody want to live out here? Sam, you're such a romantic. Come on. Yes? It's Nora Haley, Professor. I spoke with you earlier on the phone. Sergeant Taliaferro's with me. I told you on the phone, Miss Haley, I can't help you. Professor, you might be the only one who can. May we come in? Please? [SIGHING] Come in. Have a seat. Join me? Uh, no. Thanks. Professor, we need to know about the research that you did with Cameron. One person died last night and Cameron may be next. Hmm. It's true. It's already too late. I tried to convince Owen, but he, uh, didn't believe things like that could happen. Till the night he died. He tried calling me for help. There was nothing I could do. It had already gone too far. What? What had gone too far? What were you and Owen Lansing doing to that boy? Nothing. It all began quite innocently enough. No one imagined that anyone would be hurt by it. You see, uh, Owen had this dream. He believed that, uh, he could open up the vast unused powers of the mind. His theory was that the best path was through the mind of a child who had not quite learned its limitations. We needed a subject and Cameron was there. Oh, we made excellent progress at first. And then something... Something began to go wrong. That's when I left the project. Professor, you have a chance now to make amends. Help us. There's nothing I can do. You can't turn your back on Cameron now. You're a scientist, don't you even care? I'm a frightened old drunk who made the mistake of prying into a little boy's mind. Wait. There is something. I was supposed to destroy that. I don't know why I didn't. You take it. It might help you. MAN: [WHISPERING] Sam. [WIND HOWLING] [CREATURE GASPING] You know, I really feel sorry for him. Shh. Have you got a flashlight? What is it? Yeah, why? Just give it to me. What are you doing? Nothing. It's fine. Just stay where you are. I'll be right back. MAN: Sam, over here. [CREATURE GASPING] Sam. Sam. Here I am, Sam. Pete? I know what's in the closet. But it isn't in there now. It's out here, Sam. It's after you. What? Come on, I'll show you. [GASPING] Wanna know what's in the closet, Sam? [YELLING] [SCREAMING] No! DORY: Cameron! Cameron! Are you okay? Sam, are you all right? What happened? It's okay, Sam. It's okay. It's okay. Come on, let's go. [GASPING] Oh, Jesus Christ. [GROANS] Oh, my God. All you did... [MOANS] I told you to destroy that tape. That tape reveals too much. I know where it is. I can't take you while the boy protects him. You must kill the boy. No, I can't. Yes, Ben. You will kill the boy. Please don't make me do that. You know what I can do to you. Yes. [LAUGHING] Circle. Right. OWEN: The early experiments concentrated on simple telepathic procedures. A star. OWEN: Such as the card-symbol tests developed at Duke University. The months of conditioning of the boy's mind raised his telepathic powers beyond any previously measured. Three wavy lines. Three wavy lines. The experiments in psychokinesis went amazingly well. At this point the project was far ahead of schedule. My name's Cameron Lansing. I'm here with Professor Majors and my dad, Owen Lansing. And I'm about to do my marble test. Gotta go back. He wants me there. [DOOR CLOSING] Dory, what happened? Alan, don't leave, please. I don't know what to expect any more. Relax. Don't worry. I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere. He'll get me if I don't go back. What's he talkin' about? CAMERON: You should get out now. I don't know. Don't let anyone take me away. Honey, no one's coming. No one's coming. Save Sam. I can't save anyone else. CAMERON: Gotta go back. Sleep, honey. Gotta stop... Sleep. [SNIFFLING] [SIGHING] Try to sleep. OWEN: Be careful with that, Cameron. Can I play with this? You just be very careful. Image projection was remarkably simple for Cameron. Here he plays alone in the test room, unaware of the camera. A disturbing element entered the project and Cameron began to exercise his new mental powers. Perhaps unconsciously, without adult guidance, Cameron's own initiative went even beyond our intent. [REMOTE CONTROL CLICKS] [GROWLING] [ALAN SHOUTING] Alan! DORY: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh! [DORY CRYING] Help! Get help. Get help. [DORY CONTINUES CRYING] Help! Somebody, help! [GASPS] "Known by many names in many lands, "Xialtho by the Mayans. "This demon is the essence of evil. "Consigned to the lower depths of hell. "Xialtho may be called forth only by the will of an innocent child. "Once restored upon the earth, "the demon selects the place where it shall dwell. "And there it gains strength "until it surpasses the will of the child." [CAMERON HUMMING] I knew you'd come, Sam. Cameron? You should have killed me. What? [SNARLING] [SAM CHOKING] Don't you see, Sam, he's evil. You have to kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. [CAMERON HUMMING] Sam. I knew you'd come. You came to help me. No, Cameron. It was you all along, wasn't it? You killed them all, didn't you? [SAM GRUNTING] No, Sam, stop! [YELLING] No, Sam! Sam! What? We gotta go. Dory Lansing's been hurt. Her brother's dead. Cameron? She said Majors has him. [SIGHS] [SIGHS] What I'm about to say is extremely important. And through no fault of your own, you have released something very, very evil in this world. You are not responsible for what it has done so far. Your father and I are. God forgive us. So he'll kill me next. No, Cameron, it can't do that. It owes its existence to you. As long as you have a will and don't give in, you're the master. It needs, uh, someone else. And I don't want you to be afraid. I want to help you. I... I will help you. I can't stop it anymore. Of course you can. You're the only one with the power to return that creature to its rightful place in hell. Oh, we must do it tonight before the beast destroys us. It's gonna try and trick you. But you can't give in, all right? Now, I want you to concentrate on my voice, Cameron. I want you to relax your body and your mind. Let all the tension drain away as you see the lake. Soft, and quiet, and deep. It is so calm and serene. Do you see the bird? Beautiful, gliding bird. What makes you so sure they're at Cameron's house? Listen to this. "The death of the child "can happen only in the dwelling place of the demon." What? "To set its evil spirit free upon the earth, "the demon must cause the death of the child in one of two ways. "Xialtho has not this power in himself "and so must compel the murderous action in another." That's where your dreams come in. "Or the child must submit willingly to the demon." Don't you see, Sam? Cameron took this unknowingly and brought it to life. Cameron knew he was in trouble. That's why he reached out for you. You're his friend. What has this got to do with my dreams? They're deceptions. The demon wanted you to kill Cameron. The lake is calm and serene. The bird circles slowly, gently down towards the water. It's the familiar restful scene, Cameron. Whilst the bird glides down towards the lake, he will slip into a deep, deep sleep. The bird will slip into deep, deep sleep. Cameron. [GROANS] Help me. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTING] [YELLING] [SCREAMING] Come on. Is he conscious? He's under hypnosis. His pulse is very weak. We have to wake him up. Cameron, Cameron, listen to me. Sam, try talking to him. Maybe he'll recognize your voice. Cameron, it's Sam. Can you hear me? Cameron! Cameron, we're gonna help you. Dad? Dad, wait for me, please. Cameron, it's not your father. You have to fight this. He's losing. It's taking control. Wait for me, Dad. Cameron, listen to me. Dad. Cameron! Dad, wait up. You have to fight this. Cameron, Cameron! Cameron, listen to me. Wake up. Cameron, wake up. [DEMON HOWLING] Dad, wait for me. I'm right here. Cameron! I'm right here, Dad. Cameron, stop it. CAMERON: Dad, wait for me. Come here. Come here, Son. Over here. Dad! Cameron. Come on, snap out of it. Come on, boy. Come on. Cameron, it's not your father. Fight it, fight it! [GROWLING] [SAM GRUNTING] [YELLING] [ROARING] Cameron, come on, concentrate on this. You can do it. [ROARING] Cameron, you have to do it. You have to send it back. You've gotta help him. You have to help Sam. Come on, Cameron. You have to send him back. No! [GROWLING] Leave him alone. He's my friend. I brought you to this world, and I'll send you back. [ROARING] [SIGHS] Sam. Hey, come on. Let's go find your mom.
