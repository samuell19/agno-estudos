[dramatic music] [gun booming] [machine gun chattering] - [Narrator] North Alaska, a hundred years after the nuclear winter. The dense nuclear waste that used to girdle the planet has been burned away by the blistering, relentless sun. And what used to be a snow-bound earth is now nothing but a scorched and arid desert. The North Slope is controlled by a military government that calls itself The Ownership, the oil fields of Point Burough the source of it's power. But a rebel wind is rising. - Hey Harry, what's going on? - Your father's unit, the 19th Rangers, they're in some kind of trouble. [machine guns chattering] - Take cover! [dramatic music] [machine guns chattering] Fall back! [pistol booming] - Fletcher! We've got 'em on the run. Take 'em out there and draw their fire. I'll circle around. Come on! [machine guns chattering] [machine guns chattering] [dramatic music] - Let's go! - Hold it! - What the hell? - Slade. [bullets whining] [pistol booming] [machine guns chattering] Hayward. Commence firing. [machine guns chattering] - Son, what are they holding back for? [pistol booming] [machine gun chattering] [explosion booming] [machine guns chattering] [explosions booming] Damn. [machine guns chattering] [explosions booming] - Don't let up! [explosions booming] [machine guns chattering] - Don't move! - That's enough. We'll take him with us. [dramatic music] [explosions booming] [militaristic music] - Do they have the oil? Do they have the oil, over? Damn! Colonel, Fletcher's back! What happened? - We almost made it. - Damn! If we don't get some oil, we won't make it through the winter! - We've got to coordinate with the other colonies or we won't get rid of the Ownership. We've got to organize. - We got one of them. - He's an officer. Set up a prisoner exchange. Let's trade him for some of our own guys. - Tie him up, come on. So what went wrong? - We almost had our hands on it. They blew it up themselves. - Double rations for everyone! - With Holman out of the way I'd say you've got the commander's job in your pocket. - The rebels are draining our resources. The southern defenses have got to be held at all costs. - If the south falls, our oil fields will be next. - And the mountain people are acting up again. We better hope they don't get modern weapons. - I'm disturbed about this latest harassment, Major. - We've secured the area, Commander. - What about Colonel Holman? - The rebels killed him. - The man died a hero. Too bad about his boy. - Captain Slade? - He jumped under fire, went over to the enemy. - That's hard to swallow, Commander. Slade's one of your best officers. - He's a deserter. Which is bad for discipline and worse for security. I want him court-martialed. [dramatic music] - We have a potentially useful prisoner here. - Give him to me for a while, I'm sure me and my boys can make him talk. - Let's not be too hasty, here. I'd like to think of something special for this one. [laughing] [dramatic music] - Water. - Water, huh? He wants water! What's the matter, are you thirsty? You like this, huh? [laughing] [grunting] [dramatic music] [rifle booming] [fists thumping] [rifle booming] Get up, get up, get him! Go after him, go after him! [machine gun chattering] [soldiers chattering] [grunting] [guns booming] [guns booming] We lost him. - Shit! - Off your butts! There's been another theft, rockets this time. Those mercenaries. - Son of a bitch! - Get the men, we're goin' after 'em. [faint speaking] - Shit. - Come on, come on. You know these things ain't light. Jesus. Bustin' our asses, Alamo. That bitch better show. - She'll be here any minute. - I just wanna get it done, that's all. All done, now. - Tell Deke. Get that fat shithead out here. - What the hell is going on here, Deke? Will you tell these pinheads to back off? - All set. - Good. She's here. - Who's here? What are you scrubs fixin' to pull? - Shut her up! - You better never show up [muffled speaking]! - You bring the gasoline? - Right there. - What'd I tell ya? Okay, here's the way we're gonna do this. For every two cans of gasoline you pull down, we'll load up one crate of rockets. - The deal is one can, one crate. - Deal's been changed. You take it or leave it. - I don't think so. Crates, in the car. - Listen to this bitch. Crates in the car. - I'd love to blow you guys right here. - Hey wait. Look, keep your pants on, little missy. You wanna stick to the old deal, that's fine. Come on, load her up, boys. Don't listen to this guy. He's a jerk! You wanna talk business, talk to me. [grunting] - Move, move! - Okay! - Load 'em up! - Come on, guys, you heard her. Load 'em up! Come on, load 'em up! Take it easy. Come on, hurry up, man. Come on! - Get. Get outta here. - Hey, hey, hey. Get outta here, man, get out! She's serious. Take it easy, will ya? - Okay, open the door. - Okay. Okay, take it easy. - What are you doing? - Now! - She's still got the gas! [dramatic music] - She's gettin' away! - Come on, get her! - Come on, hurry up! [men chattering and whooping] - Out! Get out! - Hey, hey guys! Hey! Hey! - Come on, get in! - Give me a hand. - Come on, let's go, let's get her! Now, now! - Come on! [dramatic music] [yelling and laughing] - Come on, man! - Let's get that bitch! - Yeah! [laughing] You got this! Come on! [laughing and chattering] [laughing and chattering] [explosion booming] [laughing] - She's over there! - [Man] Come on, men, come on! [yelling and whooping] I get her first, man! Come on, get her! - There she is! - Alright, come on! [dramatic music] Get her! [laughing and whooping] [pistol booming] - Come on, let's get her. [laughing and whooping] - Come on, Deke! Hey Deke, hold up! [laughing] - Hey, I get her first, Deke? [pistol booming] [chattering and whooping] [machine gun chattering] [pistol booming] [guns booming] - Up yours, man! [machine gun chattering] [bullets whining] - This ain't healthy, Deke. - Yeah, I know. That's the Sand Chopper. - Let's make tracks. - Alright. - Where the hell'd you come from? [grunting] You're hurt bad. Come on. [dramatic music] - Somebody get a stretcher, quick. - Hey, who is this guy? Look at that uniform. Get him outta here! - He saved my hide. - We don't need any problems. - It's okay, Boze. - This better not cause any more trouble, that's all I gotta say. - Take it easy with him, guys. [soft music] Did you notice that tattoo? We disbanded that unit, oh, 20 years ago. - Fletcher's here, he wants to talk to you. Should I send him away? - Nah, I'll talk to him. [coughing] - It's okay, it's alright. You're okay. [soft music] - Come on, Dixon, you heard about Ferguson's camp. They refused to cough up and now they're all dead. The Rangers came in and butchered them. - We're ready, Ferguson wasn't. - Look, we can't make it through the winter without oil. They say they won't give us any until we give 'em more water. We can't survive that way! We've gotta stand together. We need you with us. - Sorry, Fletcher, I'm stayin' out of it. - Come on, let's get outta here. - Ownership patrol! [militaristic music] Ownership patrol! Come on, let's get outta here! Come on, the patrol's coming, let's shove off! - [Man] Come on, man, let's go! Come on! [chattering] Oh, shit! - Hold it! - Line 'em up, line 'em up! - Take your frickin' hands off me! - Where are the rockets? - What rockets? - Tell him. - Shut up! - Do it. - Wonder how many I can get with one bullet. - Wait a minute! I got some dirt. I got some dirt! Colonel! Don't shoot. Colonel! Colonel, would you listen to me? It's about the Sand Chopper! - Slade? - Yeah, yeah. - You've seen him? - Yeah, we had a run in with him a couple days ago. What'll you give me for the dirt on him? - Where is he? - Last I saw him, he was with Dixon's brat. Maybe they're at the compound. - You're taking us there. - Alright. - On your feet! You and your men are hereby drafted into the Ownership! You're entitled to two meals a day, give your names to the sergeant. This vehicle is now declared ownership property. Extra rations for the new recruits. Okay, saddle up! - You and your hot ideas. - Yeah, but we're alive. Hey, maybe we can pay back this bitch, anyway. [soft music] [grinder rasping] [dramatic music] - Look who's on his feet. - Get away from that! - It still needs a lot of work. - Who made this? - Dixon. We've been here 10 years. The Ownership won't protect us. All they care about is their oil. - And if they ever come looking for you, maybe this'll give us some equality. [soft music] - I don't trust this guy. - Boze, it's alright. What do they call ya? - Slade. - You're Holman's boy, aren't ya? He gave you the tattoo. I got one too. How is the old man? - He's dead. - Your dad and I were buddies in the ol' 25th Artillery. I was gunnery sergeant, he was ordinance. Hell of a munitions man. I hope some of it rubbed off on you. - It might've. - How'd it happen? - You don't wanna hear it. - Why don't you try me? - There's a piece of garbage out there named Lawton, and I'm gonna kill him if it's the last thing I do. - [Man] Hey look, there's one. - [Man] Hey dude, let's get 'em! [men yelling and laughing] - [Man] You take 'em on the left, take 'em on the left. - [Man] Grab 'em! - [Man] I got 'em! I got 'em! [laughing] - [Man] Get him before he gets up there. [gun booming] [dramatic music] [soldiers chattering] - [Man] Now we got 'em, come on. - [Man] Alright, alright, go for it. [men chattering and laughing] Oh, Jesus. [mountain men whooping] Come on, let's get outta here, man. [guns booming] [mountain men whooping] - You must learn to let our people live in peace. [grunting] Go back to the Ownership. Tell them they leave us alone, or else next time it will be different. This is our ambassador of peace! [grunting] [militaristic music] - Wait! Stop! Mountain people. They would have killed me, except the chief sent me back. He said to tell you to leave 'em alone. - Oh yeah? Too bad. [whimpering] [flames roaring] [screaming] - Let's go! [upbeat music] [metal clanking] [drill whining] [lathe whining] [grinder rasping] - Ownership, a whole brigade! Ownership! [bell clanging] - Shit, I knew this was gonna happen! - Ownership, Ownership! - Ownership, to your posts! Everybody get to their posts! It's the Ownership! Ownership coming! - [Man] To your posts! - Over here! Everybody on the line. Get the ammo on the cart, bring the ammo out here! We have to get the ammo lines, start an ammo line! Bazooka man, save your ammo. Don't shoot till I give you a target! [engines rumbling] - We're coming in! - What's your business? - We're looking for a deserter and some stolen rockets! Our information says they're both in there! I'm giving you 30 seconds! - You got no right to come in here! Why don't you just turn around? - I want Slade, and I want him now! [dramatic music] - Hand him over, Dixon. - Get ready. - Spread out! Hit 'em! [explosions booming] [guns booming] [explosions booming] [guns booming] [explosions booming] [guns booming] [explosions booming] [guns booming] [explosion booming] [gun booming] [explosions booming] [rockets whistling] [explosions booming] [guns booming] [explosions booming] [guns booming] [explosions booming] [rockets whistling] [explosion booming] [guns booming] [guns booming] [dramatic music] [explosion booming] [gun booming] [explosion booming] [guns booming] [explosion booming] [guns booming] [explosion booming] [fire crackling] - We can't hold. We're gonna have to pull out. - Alright go, I'll cover you. [rifle bolt clicking] - I'm staying behind. - Meet ya at the pinnacles. - Move out! Come on, let's go! - Fall back, fall back! Evacuate the wounded! Regroup at the pinnacles and bring everything you can carry! - Move! I said move out! Go! Come on! Move! - You'll need this. [guns booming] [explosions booming] - Karen, get the car! [guns booming] - We're ready. - Let's get the hell outta here. - Let's go, come on, let's go! [guns booming] [explosions booming] [dramatic music] [guns booming] [gun booming] [explosions booming] [screaming] [guns booming] [explosions booming] - You guys go after Dixon, take some troops. We follow Slade. - Alright, let's go! [dramatic music] [pistol booming] [explosion booming] [machine gun booming] [explosion booming] [pistol booming] [bullet whining] [machine gun booming] [pistol booming] [machine gun booming] [rocket whistling] [explosion booming] [rocket whistling] [explosion booming] - Spin it, spin it! [rockets whistling] [explosions booming] - I want that gun. - Come on, they're attacking! - Take cover! [explosions booming] [dramatic music] [guns booming] [guns booming] [dramatic music] [uneasy music] [gun booming] [guns booming] [explosions booming] [guns booming] - Slade! Put down the gun! - Caught you with your pants down, didn't we, Sand Chopper? - Don't get smart, or the old man flies up to heaven! Now back off! Now you're gonna die [laughing]. [grunting] - Give me that! [fists thumping] It's mine! - Hey! [fists thumping] - Come on, let's go! Move it! [laughing] [fist thumping] - You cut the rest loose. - Yeah. - Here. - Alright. Come on, guys, we're gettin' outta here. - Get me outta these things. [laughing] [gun booming] [explosion booming] - Yes, yes, that's good. - If there's any penetration, we'll change to this. Now we move this over to here. - Yes, Lawton, what's the problem? - Commander, we've come up against a formidable piece of iron. It's a combined automatic sitting on top of a portable cannon. It'll stop anything. - It's with Dixon's crowd. They've been using our own rockets against us. - Confiscate the weapon. I don't want the rebels to get hold of it. They've given us enough trouble as it is! - After I seize it, Commander, I guarantee you we'll crush the rebels. - You don't think you're gonna get away with this, do you? - Well, we'll just have to see, babe. Hey, let me see that. Hey! - You stinking son of a bitch! - What do you you think you're doin', man? - I'm not takin' it in the shorts, this time! - You're forgettin' who's boss, you little punk! - Come on, man, go for it. [laughing] - Okay, Deke. If that's what you want. - Go for it, man, I'm ready! [gun booming] - Hey, don't shoot! Don't shoot, Deke! Hey, this won't fire, man. - This the only piece of shit you got? - Hey. - Tie him up! - Hey, come on! Hey, let me go! What are you doing to me, man? Let me go, man! Hey, let go of me, man. Let go of my arm, man. What are you doing, Skip? Skip, let go of me, man! [grunting] Hey, let me go. Hey, what are you guys doing? You. - I'm not gonna kill you, Alamo. I'm gonna let you watch the sun go down. - You. - Let's ride! - You dirt bag. Deke, get me outta here! Hey! Cut me loose, you guys! Hey, come on! - Let's go, pack it in. Move it! - Hey! Hey! Deke! - Turn over so you don't get burned. - Hey! Hey, guys! Hey, Deke! Deke, don't leave me! Deke! [upbeat music] - You're wasting your time. - You know the situation, Firewall. Our only chance is to unite! - We are not concerned with your fight. - It's your fight too, you know that! - The Ownership? They will not bother us anymore. - If they push us, believe me, Firewall, they'll come and push you too. - We are always ready. - We are not afraid of winter. [fire roaring] We do not need their oil, and we do not need your troubles. Go now! - You'll regret this. [upbeat music] - Search the area! - Colonel, over here! - He's roasted. Won't last. - Torch him. [fire roaring] [screaming] - My ol' pal, Dinah, will be glad to see us. - Hold it! Deke, you stinking slime bag, I swore if I ever laid eyes on you again, I'd kill you! - Come on, Dinah, you know you didn't mean that. - I can't stand the sight of you. Get outta here! - Dinah, we got no place else to go. - Tough! You are a dead man. Oh, dammit, Deke. [soft music] - I can see I'm gonna have a major problem keeping my hands off of you. Come on, kitten, don't be skittish! - Hey, boss? - Sorry boys, you're on your own. [soft music] [dramatic music] [fist thumping] [fists thumping] [gun booming] [foot thumping] [grunting] [fists thumping] [fist thumping] - Come on, Colonel, come on! - Let him go! - Come on! [gun booming] [dramatic music] [explosion booming] [men cheering] - Based on our latest intelligence reports, we expect the rebels to move down to this point within a couple of weeks. They're running out of time. - Containment, gentlemen, that's the key. Get the enemy where we want him, and then squeeze him till he chokes. - Lawton's here. - Oh. - [Man] Hey, that's quite a gun. That must be it, take a look at this! Ooh, look at that. - [Hayward] We got it! We got the sucker! [men cheering] - Is this the hardware you were talking about? You'll get a procedural endorsement for this, Lawton. - I'm stripping you of command, MacLaine. - You've been out in the desert too long. - I'm taking over. [gun booming] [gun booming] [dramatic music] [fire crackling] - Where do we go from here? - I'm going after Lawton. [soft music] - Slade, why'd you do it? - Do what? - Come back for me? - The tide is on our side, now. We're getting more volunteers than we can handle. - I think we're ready for a full scale assault. - It could be a disaster if we move before we're ready. - Colonel! - Fletcher. - All that crap we've been hearing from the borderlands about a mean gun? - What about it? - It's true, the Ownership has it. - Damn it! [dramatic music] - Guys! It's them! Come on, get the gate open! - [Man] Come on! - Get that gate open, open the gate! Hurry and open that gate! [whooping] Oh, it's good to see you! [laughing] I've been so worried. - What are you doing here? - Ah, we're going to join the rebels. - Boze! - [Man] Hey, hand me that crow bar, will ya? Give me that! - Woo! Dowdie! - Karen! - Oh, you wouldn't believe what happened. Where's your old man? - [Dowdie] Right over there. - Ah! Hi! - Hey, it's good to see you. We were worried about you. - Slade! Slade! Slade! Slade, we're going to join the rebels. Stay with us. - You know I can't do that. - Listen, your best shot at Lawton is to fight with us. The rebels wanna bring him down. - That's politics. This is personal. - Slade, listen to me. I'm trying to get through to you! I guess it's because I care about you. [laughing] - Hey guys, what do you think about a little target practice, huh? - Make him dance a little first! - Yeah [laughing]. - Yeah, that what I'm talkin' about. - Alright. - Alright, open up, men, go for it! Make 'em dance! [guns booming] [guns booming] [guns booming] - I'm out. - Hey, me too. [gun booming] [laughing] - Hey. [fist thumping] [spear thumping] [dramatic music] - Come on, let's get him! Go! [spear thumping] [grunting] - Thank you, thank you! - Thank you, thank you! [militaristic music] - All the troops divided and ready to go, sir. - Good. Let's move out! All unit commanders prepare to move out. - We're all set. - How's that leg? - It'll work. - It's good to have you aboard. - Sir, headquarters wants a status report. - Tell the Colonel this is it, we're moving out. - Dixon and my men are on their way. - Remember, avoid contact on the way. - They know that. Skirt enemy positions, hit 'em in the flanks with a pincer movement. - And we provide the frontal diversion. - Right. - Good luck! - Pull out! [militaristic music] [expectant music] [dramatic music] - Shit. Sound the alarm! Stinkin' rebels! - Idiots. They're making it too easy for me. Battle stations! - Battle stations! Get moving, now! [dramatic music] Move out, let's go! [alarm buzzing] To your stations! Get to your stations, dammit! [men chattering] Let's go, let's go, to the front! Come on! [men yelling and chattering] [guns booming] [explosions booming] [guns booming] [fire roaring] [screaming] [fire roaring] [guns booming] - Pull back and retreat! - Turn around, turn around! [guns booming] [fire roaring] [screaming] - Oh, shit! [fist thumping] [screaming] [fire roaring] [screaming] [explosions booming] [guns booming] [fire roaring] [screaming] [guns booming] [mountain people cheering] [guns booming] - Oh no, it's the mountain people. [mountain people whooping] - Come on, let's get 'em! [dramatic music] [thumping and grunting] [gun booming] [grunting] [gun booming] [fire roaring] [guns booming] [mountain people whooping] - Let's go. - The mountain people have thrown in with the rebels. - Close the gates. [mountain people whooping] [guns booming] [dramatic music] [grunting and thumping] [gun booming] [gun booming] [thumping and grunting] [gun booming] [fist thumping] [mountain people whooping] [guns booming] [fire roaring] [guns booming] [explosion booming] [dramatic music] [guns booming] [gun booming] [guns booming] [guns booming] - Lawton! [gun booming] [dramatic music] [grunting] [fists thumping] [guns booming] - Okay, let's go! Move out! [gun booming] - Come on, come on through. [guns booming] [mountain people whooping] [guns booming] [gun booming] [fists thumping] [grunting] [thumping and grunting] [gun booming] [gun booming] [guns booming] [cheering] [soft music] [upbeat music]
