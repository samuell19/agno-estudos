Stretching from the Northern Black Sea to the Southern Blood Sea, are seven continents formed after the time of the sea separation. Closest to the south is the Green Haven territory, where the Centaurs and the Elves reside. Floating across the Blood Sea are the many sea rocks and whirlpools, where the Merpeople dwell. The rocky hanging cliff islands under the caves belong to the Harpies. For a very long time, Harpies and Merpeople were each other's nemesis, Their war lasted for years, casualties were countless and blood was shed all over the sea, hence the name it bears. To the east is the dense forest with high mountains and hills, fully dominated by the Lycans. The stone plateau with countless fortresses made of long rocky edges is the sanctuary of the Nagas, well-trained and the finest warriors in the Great War. The small continent not far from it is called the Foggy Land, all year round covered with clouds and thunder, few ventured in and no one traveled out of this land. Rumor has it, inside is a prosperous area. It is said to be a gift from the Divine to the Woodlings and the docile, weak subtribes as a refuge. Outside forces always desire the rare and precious flora owned by the Woodlings. In contrast, this is the Eternal Desert with endless views of sand dunes. The day is fiery, the night is sheer cold that can break any stone. At the bottom of the desert are the creepy Devil Worms living in herds. They have the most poisonous drool which can dissolve flesh Living in symbiosis with them are carnivorous vines with giant stunning flowers, called Tru Lung Thao. In the West pole lies the Old Moon kingdom with a crescent-shaped land. Five tribes live there: Kitsune, Draconians, No-Face, Goblins, and Golems. Finally, in the North pole, the last stronghold to prevent the mixing of the races, the Ancient Kingdom, was where Humans fought fiercely against the mysterious forces and bizarre creatures. Here in this realm, only anonymous and age-old clans exist with countless names and identities. People dare not call the very names of the ancient and powerful monsters. One example of which is the Vampires. I cannot remember the time when I was a human. My memory starts with Huy Long waking me up and calling me Duc Cuong. Since then, I have been Master's Butler taking care of everything for him. That was hundreds of years ago. Thousands of years ago, when I did not exist, Master had fought in a big war among the vampire clans. A poison from an ancient vampire entered his bloodstream and has tortured him ever since the war ended. Now, at the moment when nine planets align and blood type RH-has been gathered, the cleansing ritual will take place. The reward for the final winner is the official position as housekeeper with a salary of one million gold coins per year and countless other benefits. As I already announced, the first rule is you can't use your phone during your internship if you have to leave, you will get your phone back. But, doesn't it sound inconvenient? Yes, it is. But that's why it's called a rule. No rule exists with ease. You can choose, the exit is over there. If you need to use the phone, you can ask me. But only if there's a real need. I need you to focus on your work here. When is it considered necessary enough? Think about it. Can we borrow your phone anytime? You can go home to use your phone for the rest of your life. This is the handbook for handmaids. You'll find everything that you need to do daily in it. This includes every rule in the house, your benefits and the special regulations that you need to keep in mind. Read it and think carefully before you ask anything. Here are some special regulations that you need to know. Firstly, our Master's health. As a handmaid, not only will you have to manage everything in the house but also take care of the Master. So, report any chronic, transmittable disease or allergy you may have. I need your health to meet my requirements. Is He allergic to something? - How do you know? - I'm just guessing. He can be sensitive to allergy prone-things. Finally, like all others who live in this mansion, you are not allowed to enter Master's room or mine without permission. Do you understand? This is the dining room. Also, all the servants in this house are deaf. If you don't know sign language, and you want to say something, you can write it down. Please, gather in the lobby in two hours. Is this the Master's drink? - I'll help you. - No. Didn't the sunscreen work? Ah, it's because I stayed outside too long. How old are you? - Is it okay? - It's going to need time. I'll inform you later. Hello, editor-in-chief, I'm at the mansion. Yes. Just as we expected, all the power is in the butler's hands. The Master has not shown up. Yes. Yes, sir. I'll be careful. If there's more information, I'll let you know. Okay. I have not been able to take photos yet. Okay, sir. Yes, don't worry. I will try my best. Okay, I got it. Lay low and wait for my command. Yes. Do not act impulsively. I can definitely do it. You're on time. Did I scare you? Yeah, a little. Then, how can I let you have this mission? I'm sorry. I've already arranged it. What you have to do is enter the mansion, observe quietly and wait for my command and the organization's. Humans are not your enemy. Don't act spontaneously. Vampires, the devils who murdered my whole family. It's good that you remember. Now, go back and remember what I told you to do. I know. - But... - What? What else? It's been more than 20 years since you saved me from those devils. But I have never seen your face. This is one of the organization's rules. If you can complete your mission this time and join the organization, then you can see my face. Yes, sir. I understand. You will see my face soon. How come you're out this late? I couldn't sleep so I went out for a walk. Why aren't you in bed? I see that you took a walk pretty far from the mansion. I just got here, I didn't know the way very well. I brought a lamp in case I got lost. I just meant to walk around, not to drift far away from here. That sounds reasonable. That's the truth. Go to your bedroom, tomorrow we'll start training If it's not necessary, you shouldn't go out at night Okay, I understand. Looks like your hand is injured, do you need... I've got medicine. You need to take care of yourself before worrying about others. I'm an orphan, I've been able to take care of myself very well since I was a child. I can also take care of my loved ones. Don't worry, Good night, Mr. Cuong. This is the servants' job. Why did Mr. Cuong make us do these things? Kim, aren't you done? Why are you taking so long? Better safe than sorry. Caution is different from lack of competence - What do you mean? - I'm just joking, don't stress. You seem to like flowers and plants. They are beautiful. Who doesn't? Blossoming flowers will eventually scatter. Only pearls and jewelry last forever. Beautiful gems are useless decorations. Flowers do wither and scatter but they can be deadly if poisonous. Idiot. What are you doing? - Yes... - Who allowed you to touch my stuff? My apologies. I just want to lend you a hand. Don't waste your efforts on these things, get it? I did not mean to. It's fine. Let her go. Just give her a first warning. Master. You're not an old man. Don't be harsh. Go back to work. Wolfsbane, or werewolves' spit, is known to be extremely lethal to vampires. It makes wounds unhealable. Antidotes can treat if minimally impacted but sequelae are long-lasting. Mixing it with herbal potions such as Datura's Pistil, Nepenthes Acid or Devil's Blossom will create a sliver bullet to destroy our kind. Tu, what are you doing? Me? I'm working. Curiosity is a bad virtue. Mas... Master... Is that our Master? Let's go. Tu, are you okay? Tu, what's happening? Huh? Tu, sit here. Assign the handmaids some work, don't let them fool around, or else bad things will happen. How is it possible? The Master is fine, no sign of imprisonment or robbery. That butler screwed me over. Why is everything a mess? How can I report? No. I can't just sit still like this. I have to report in now to find a solution, if not I may lose the job. This is such a mysterious mansion. I never see the owner. What if it is not what we are looking for? I just want to call my family. That all? Yes. Looks like you have forgotten to delete the sent photos of this mansion? What are you saying? Which sent photos? Don't you know that your phone has archived everything? Don't tell me... you have no idea about it? No, it was not me. I did not send anything. Well, okay. Sure thing, journalist Ngoc Tu, a hardworking employee of The Raven. What is your pseudonym? Go back to your room and pack up. I'm telling you, I admit that I used my phone, but I didn't send out any photos or information about this house. Don't blame me for something I did not do. This is a lesson for you guys. You can consider yourself cunning but don't consider others naive. Oh, Mr. Cuong. Wow, I didn't expect him to be that harsh. Rules are rules. It's not like he hasn't warned us. If you deliberately violate rules, you accept the consequences. Can we talk about something else? Like the glass with red water in it? Cuong said it was the Master's supplement. When we officially become the butler, he'll give us the recipe. What if that's a blood recipe? How could that be possible? Have you ever heard about an immortal? Are you talking about vampires? Only vampires live forever. Be careful, you don't have a fortune to pay for it. Uh, who am I talking to, the deaf? Servants' tasks should not be touched by housekeepers. We're only interns. Gossip shouldn't exist in this house. Be careful. Master! The day when nine planets align is coming. How is everything? Everything's fine, don't worry Master. The nine planets only align every few thousand years, and it takes a lot of work to gather five girls with this rare RH-blood type. But... you seem off. Everything's fine. I've collected and checked the blood, the herbs are also ready. The ritual stone has been remodeled. With my responsibilities, have I ever disappointed you? Never before. But I don't know now. Please excuse me, I have work to do. I'm going to check again, please do not worry too much. What you need to check is right here. We haven't been human for a long time, we don't have hearts. Don't joke with me. I really need to find out what I can about this mansion. If it wasn't Tu, then who took these photos? They need to be tested. When I become the hostess of this house, our lives will flourish. Today we'll have the second test. But it's not supposed to happen for a few days. Yeah. This is such a sudden announcement, how can we prepare? Quickly responding to solve unexpected problems is also one of the requirements. Go get prepared. Make a dish for our Master with the available ingredients. What? From the available ingredients? You know we receive fresh ingredients every morning, but they haven't delivered yet today. We don't have much left from yesterday That's why it's a challenge, you have three hours to do it. Begin. I'm not good at cooking, why did he make such a sudden announcement? Why does Kim look so happy while everyone else is worried? Does she know something? If so... Do Kim and Quynh have the same recipe? I don't know, this dish is my father's favorite. It can be said, that it's a traditional dish in my family. Traditional? Why is Kim...? Same dish but different effects. Master, Mr. Cuong. We'll start with Ngan. Next. Too bland. I'll try better next time. Next. What's the matter? Master, let's go. Mr. Cuong! Stay there. I'll deal with you later. It's wolfsbane. How could that happen? Look at what happened to Master, there must be something wrong with the dish. I have to try it to see what's wrong. Don't! That's too dangerous. Mr. Cuong, how's Master? What have you done? Where did you get it? I... I swear I don't know anything. Don't waste your time explaining. Everything is so clear now. You know what to do, don't you? No, I have to say it. If my soup caused the Master to be poisoned, Kim's soup would too. We had the same recipe, it is impossible only mine would cause a problem. I want to check Kim's soup. Same recipe? Does Kim know the traditional recipe of Quynh's family or...? Whose recipe it is isn't the point. Let's see if there are any more tricks. Kim's dish has no issues. What else do you have to say? It can't be. it's the same recipe. You have 30 minutes to pack. Mr. Cuong... Same dish but different effects. Master, Mr. Cuong. You, you screwed me over. What needs to be done must be done. Do you feel better? I'm fine. If you're not, you can say so. You know how wolfsbane affects us. It's your job to manage people in this house. If the ritual didn't require warm fresh blood, I would never let a bunch of girls cause all kinds of problems. I'm sorry. I'll be more careful. And don't worry, I'm preserving those two tubes of blood. It's too large, the connecting villas with hundreds of rooms. Why do two people need that much space to live in? Sightseeing again? I've dropped my earring somewhere. It must have been expensive. There are things money can't buy. This is a keepsake from my mother. I never got to see her face. No memory of family, no past, That's a wound that can never heal. If so, are you...? What's wrong with me? How can I have feelings for him? I don't understand myself. Cuong is a vampire. What's the matter with you, Ngan? Have you forgotten the fact that your family was killed? The organization has not contacted me for a while. - What happened? - No, it's nothing. My hand hurts. Put a bandage on it. Quick, go get a bandage. So careless of you. What are you taking? Allergy medicine? What are you allergic to? I... I'm allergic to blood. Mr. Cuong, I didn't think it affected my job, so I didn't tell you. Please, I'm begging you. I need this job. What's the matter? Why can I smell fresh blood? Nothing to worry about. Ngan just cut herself. I can't be kicked out of here. Tu and Quynh have been eliminated. Ngan, Kim and I are the only ones left. They have so many strengths whereas my allergy is causing me to lose points. No. I have to win Mr. Long's affection. Yes. I'm not here to be a housekeeper. I'm here to be the first lady. Confirming the wolfsbane has been delivered. I got it. Why did she take it? How did she know about it among all other things? This must be investigated carefully. Kim, a moment please. Yes, sir. Have you seen Kim, Ngan? I don't know, I saw her leave with Mr. Cuong. What's going on? Nothing. I'm just asking. This is my chance to approach Mr. Long. You're hurting me. What are you doing? I don't understand anything you're saying. You don't understand or you don't want to? So? What do you have to say, huh? What are you saying? I don't get it. I really want to be a housekeeper here. It'd better be the only purpose. Is it the same way Mr. Cuong always prepares it for Master? Who is it? It's Huong, I brought your drink. Who told you to? Mr. Cuong. This is not your duty. Do you need my help? No, I don't. Do you feel better? I'm fine. Okay, then have some rest. If you need anything just tell me. Why are you up so early today? I was out last night. Was there something important? You care for me? Kim, you used dodgy ways on the Master? What do you mean, Huong? We're going out today. Okay, sir. Well, go get prepared. - Let's go. - What about Huong? Let's go. Master! Don't be weird. You've lived over a hundred years, this is nothing new to you. Since you act strangely, you think everyone's like you? What's up with you lately? You... I thought we were going out, I didn't expect a walk in the forest. So boring. It's fine for me. I'm enjoying the fresh air here, better than the stuffy atmosphere at home. Aren't you going to talk to Mr. Long? Are you jealous? Don't know what you're talking about. It's true that Mr. Long has style and is handsome, it's normal that you feel jealous. Do you like him? He is indeed very handsome. But... your maturity definitely gives others peace of mind. Nonsense. What do you like to do the most? Why are you asking? Fine, don't tell me. I love watching the moon. Looks like your hand is injured. Do you need? I've got medicine. If you want to take care of others, you'd better take care of yourself first. I'm an orphan. I've been taking care of myself very well since I was a child. I can also take care of my loved ones. Don't worry! Good night! No memories about family, no past, a wound that can never heal. Mr. Cuong. At night, if there's nothing urgent, don't go outside alone. Thanks for caring about me. It's just my duty. But, the way I see it, it's not just duty. You seem to think too much. No. There's nothing wrong with caring about the people you love. Really? But I have no one to love. Mr. Cuong... it's late, don't drink too much. Wine is not good for your health. Please excuse me. I have to go back to my room. She was right. But what she doesn't know is I love her. Even though I know it's not going to happen. It's really stupid to keep avoiding the truth. I'm so stupid. I'm so stuck now. I cannot be kicked out of here without my last strike. Long is a man, I don't believe that I can't do it. Mr. Long, I have something to tell you. Can I come in, Mr. Long? I'm always curious about this glass of liquid. It must be something special. Actually, what is it? What makes it so special? What are you doing? Mr. Long, I just want to talk. Get out. I have something to tell you. Don't touch me. Mr. Long, why do you treat me like this? - Let go. - Why are you so cold to me? Let me go. Blood, it's really blood. There's no doubt anymore, it's real. Vampires and immortality. Dad, Mom. Finally I've found it. Last night, Huong's allergy got worse. I sent her to the emergency room. Someone will be here to collect her belongings. Can we... Can we go visit her at the hospital? No, you don't need to. It was so bad they moved her to the city hospital. You'll have time to meet later. Now, please go back to your daily routine. What? Not happy to see me? You think too much. I think too much? Or you are startled? I can see that you've stopped considering me your first priority, am I right? No, I haven't. It's fine to fall for a beautiful woman like Ngan. You've been with me for hundreds of years. We are the same kind, we're family. Are you leaving me? I'd never think of that, Master! Good! I believe you. Why did you ask me here? I've got things to do. I have to go. What I'm about to tell you is true. I don't know if you're going to believe me. Don't beat around the bush. It's something unimaginable, but when I tell you, I'll have to get results. Looking mysterious doesn't make the story much more believable What do you think about this house? The two men living here and the mysterious disappearances. I don't think about it. Every family has their own problems. We shouldn't meddle in their family business. If I say both of them are vampires, immortal, who possess the secret of immortality which everyone desires? You desire, Kim. Not everyone. I underestimated your innocent look. Well, you obviously know more than me. Okay. Let me be straight. I want you to work with me, in return, you'll become immortal. I'm not at all interested in immortality. You're looking at the wrong person. If you know the truth, your only choice is to co-operate with me. Otherwise, I will tell them that you use the phone secretly. You have no other choice. Are you threatening me? It's you who's telling me things. I had the guts to come here, I'm not afraid of your threats. Just do what you want. I'll pretend that this conversation never happened. Just one piece of advice. You should leave soon, don't get yourself in any trouble. Who are you? It's time, I can't hesitate anymore. I have to split them up. I can't fight them alone. Not to mention that if I fail this time or get killed, everything I've done is for nothing. It's time to use all the weapons I have. So it is confirmed? She was the one who poisoned me? I've investigated carefully. It was her who stole my drugs. I thought they was lost in the mail. Normally I don't buy wolfsbane. But this time, the ritual requires it. Don't worry! I've traced her origins. She was sent to an orphanage. Her parents were killed, because they wanted to be like us. Her relatives didn't want to be involved. So they sent her to an orphanage and faked all of her information. What are you planning to do next? I'm waiting for your command. Go for it. Is it urgent? Unsure prey should be devoured. Plus, we need her blood anyway. Up to you. Let's see how you are against me once I have the Datura Pistil. Master. Look, at the end she's still very tenacious. It's true that a snake always carries its poison. Deal with the rest of it. Sorry, I'm late. It's okay. I'm just gazing at the moon. I know you have things to do. The moon is really beautiful today. It's full moon day. Something's troubling you? You don't need to tell me. But why did you want to see me here? You said the other day you love to gaze at the full moon from the highest place possible. You remember? When you've been able to take care of yourself, you can take care of your loved ones. I'm sorry. I won't let you go. Congratulations on completing the blood transfer ritual! Follow your blood scent. Master, why? Normally, you are smart. Why are you so dumb now? You... I was not poisoned but I needed this ritual to transform into the most powerful evil to dominate the vampire world. So I needed you. It wasn't a waste to turn you into a vampire after all. This world doesn't and shouldn't need another super vampire. So, you are worthless to me now, my butler. Are you okay? Why did you transform me? - Why? - Ngan. Why? I'm sorry, but I couldn't lose you. I had to follow his orders and took your blood. I didn't expect the prey I've been raising to fall in love. And become vampires. What? What are you saying? Ngan, you have never had this attitude with me before. Does this voice make you feel better? RH-blood, Mom, Dad, I... It's you. It's you who killed my family. You've never disappointed me with your intelligence, my girl. And you guys should be happy because you are the first vampires ever to die at a super vampire's hand. You bastard. Asshole. Ngan, stop! Ngan. Ngan. Cuong. - Ngan. - Let me go. - Let's go of me. - Calm down, Ngan. Please, calm down. Listen to me. This is our only chance. This is wolfsbane liquid the most poisonous liquid to vampires. Cuong. I've been wrong all my life. If loving you is wrong, then I don't want to be right. So sweet! Stab me, come on. Ngan.
