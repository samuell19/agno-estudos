Hey you! - Bava! - Yes? - Drop it, Turk. - Hey slowly. Hey Olakka? They said it's smuggling but we are just lifting loads here. - Keep those boxes inside. - Okay. Pacheek, the Headman has come to know about it. That lawyer Raman can't be trusted. We don't need a union here. Are we not being ungrateful? - Why should we do it? - What do you know? Lawyer Raman isn't alone in it. Secretary, civildore, Kunjunni master... police and even shipping company officials are involved. The headman can't get away with it anymore. Hey Pachee! What can't Headman get away with? What is going on here? A union meeting? I heard that you and the lawyer are setting up a new union. Don't you know that times are changing, Mr. Headman? It's not going to work like it used to. What do you mean? I'll finish off your union, you pig. Go and die, you pig! Pig, will you bite the hand that fed you? Kill him! Who else wants to fight? Come on, you dogs! Who else is there? Come on, you stupids. Come on, you pig. If you dare touch Pacheekk... you will be dead, pigs! And you... I don't care if you are a headman.

Santo, my family hasn't eaten for 3 days It's nobody's fault. People are struggling to survive. Our fate is to die fighting each other Hamsa, your tea. - Where is Moidu? - I don't know, he is busy. See you then. Brother, put it on my tab. Allah! Allah! Brother What is wrong? - Do you want to go to a hospital? - No. Please help me get home, son. - Where do you live, ikka? - Panan colony. Come.

There is so much to be done for the wedding. What is it, mother? Isn't he home yet? No Then what about the money? What did I tell you, Mom? Is there any problem? Don't know Pacheekk called us. No one knows what is happening. They say that headmen are gone. There is talk about some union. Then what about us? It's a government order. Lawyer, Kunjunni Master and Pacheekk! 'We called this meeting to inform you of an important matter.' 'We are launching a new union without the Headmans.' 'Cochin Harbour Workers' Union' 'All of you should support our union.' What the hell is a union? 'The general secretary of the union' 'Mr. Pacheekk will speak to you.' Great! Couldn't they find anyone else? 'Dear workers' He is giving a speech! 'The new union...' 'The new...' 'The new age comes with changes' Can he even read? 'in our port too' So that's the problem! 'it has been ushered in...' - What the hell is he saying? - Something is wrong with him. There is something wrong. 'The union called CTTS...' 'with this consideration' Do we get to work? 'is being con... consti.. constituted' - What organisation? - What did he just say? - What! - I don't know. Hey! Here's the thing. There won't be any headmen now And no tokens will be thrown. Then what about us? The union will decide who gets the tokens. WE will decide. - That sounds good. - That will do. Hamsa... Take this to the Jewess. It's your grandmother's earring. Mom! Why? What will I do with it? There are so many expenses to cover. We have to pay the cleric, the cook... You go. There are a hundred things to be done with that money. (Chanting of Jewish prayer) Brother! My child is sick. Her mother is also unwell. The tonics from hospital are not helping. I need more money, madam. I have nowhere else to go. You borrowed money from me a long time ago. Then you stopped coming this way. Please don't say that, madam. No, Kunjali, at least pay up the interest. No capital, no interest... You better go. I've to take her to a surgeon. GO! You come in. - Six rupees. - That's not enough. Then how much do you want? Ten. Ten won't do. What will I do with 10? Fifteen. Okay, 15 it is. It's the most. I need five rupees. Can't you see him waiting? It's okay, give it to her. Give. Is it gold itself? Ummani! Your papa has collapsed. Come fast. Hey, don't you need this? Let go of him, dear. Let go. Should we inform someone? Whom? They had no one else. 'La ilaha Illalla' Go home for the wedding. We will take care of this. I married from Mangalore. But you won a lottery, man. He is a gentleman. Mom, has Moidu ikka come? Sister! Where is Moidu? Then let Hamsa do it. Hamsa will do it. Sit down, Hamsa. (Prayer in Arabic) (Marriage vows in Arabic) Mom, why didn't Moidu ikka come? Don't cry, my dear child. Go. Write to me once you reach the ship. Go. Let's go. She is asleep, son. You come tomorrow. "Do not savour a woman's sight Do not waver your eyelids" "Do not savour a woman's sight Do not waver your eyelids" "I want no woman, land or gold I don't want to burn in fire" "I want no woman, land or gold" Adru! "Why see the world..." Did you forget that Khadeeja was getting married tonight? Your mother didn't invite me. Did she forget to invite you also? I'm a bad guy, Mom. Rotten bad... I... Nasty fellow, Mom. Nasty fellow... I couldn't meet Kaachi. You wanted money, right? Here it is, mother. Did Kaachi say anything about me? Kaachi... I couldn't meet her. I couldn't see her off... Mom, only if dad were alive... What if dad were alive? Why did you drink? Kaachi... You don't make any sense. He gets drunk and talks nonsense! Mom, if dad were alive... Who bought you liquor? Moidu? Moidu, go and lie down. Let the devil get out of you. Son? Hamsa, help him up. Get up Moidu, get up. Get up. Where were you, Hamsa? Koya sent me to the Civildore's. Hurry up or you won't get a token. - Hey, back off! - Go away. What the heck? We had a mad race to get here. - We are out of tokens. - Go Can I get one token? You should register your name in advance. We are ready to register. It's too late for that. Now clear off! What in the world! - To hell with the union! - Go away.

Headmen left and unions took their place. Now they loot us, that's all. 173 Hamsa The rent had been due for months. So they turned her out. When I saw her leaving I asked her to come in. I told her I'll be back after bathing. But when I returned she was gone. I have no idea where she went. Where will a lone girl go? Allah only knows! - Koya tried to stab me. - Who is Koya? My son! Your son? Then it's okay. I thrashed him a few times. So he charged at me with a dagger. Did he? Don't be easy on him. Forget that he is your son. What is wrong with you? Let him grow into a daring man. Why blame the poor children? There are no jobs. Even I'm thinking of turning to stealing. There he goes again. Why do you hang out with that Santo? You should talk to Pacheekk. I'd rather kill myself than join your union. Get lost, man! Don't you dare swear at our union from here. Just leave it, Moidu. He is upset. Why is he upset? Here, take it. Your leader's name is Chadayanmuri, right? The police has nabbed him. What do you mean? When? I don't know. I heard it from Pacheekk. Hey you!

Why are you trying things that are beyond you? What happened to you? Hurry up. Come on, Hamsa. Let's go. 'Workers of the country, unite Long live PCLU' 'To hell with the oppressors To hell with the tormentors' Where is Umma? She went to bathe. That policeman has left the hospital. Don't go out. He will be looking for you. What a good thrashing he got! I heard he got eight sutures on his head. Where did you work before? But he misbehaved with me. Will you hit anyone who misbehaves with you? You would? Yes, I'll. Then I would like to see it. Will you hit me? Is this gold? Give it to me. I'll return it next week. - No! - Why not? It's my vaapa's gift. Vaapa? You are so cheeky. All I asked is a bangle. - Ummani? - Yes. Who is there? Is that you, Moidu? Moidu? - Are you here to see her? - No, umma, I came to see you. I'm hungry, umma. Give me some food.

Do you know what kind of a man your father was? I'm tired of hearing this. I don't even remember his face. Moidu, don't forget Allah is watching over you. There's no point in remembering Allah. - There is no vaapa or Allah here. - Don't give up on Allah, Moidu. - Only we know how hard it is to live here. - This is my fate. Go and give it to him. Let him shove it down his throat. - Damned! - She will start the minute I'm here. This is my fate! Maimu's son indeed! Your damn prayers! - Your prayers are driving me mad. - Shouldn't I pray then? You brought home a girl. But do you even come home? Yes, I'm a bad lot. So what? Leave me alone. I'll go away. That's what you want, right? Umani, I'm going to fetch water. Don't let him leave. He will get himself killed. Ikka! Shut up. What is wrong with you? I'm scared. Sacred of what? Move, you corpse!

PCLU should not come up on this port again. Do you get that, Pacheekk? It was tough persuading the government to issue an order. We had to run from post to pillar. - I saw them putting up posters. - Pacheekk, you should deal with them. Let's go and have a smoke. No, he might call us now. I'm going. Do you want to join? Moidu?

So have you decided to fight it out? Yes. Where is that shameless pig? I used to carry him in my arms when he was a boy. Now he has the cheek to beat up my son. If you can't keep your hands off then hit your mother. He has neither God nor faith... and roams around Amaravathi. Maimu's son indeed! It's better not to have children than have one like him. No fear of God or the devil! He thinks he is one hell of a rowdy. You should work hard for money or it will be wasted. May lightning strike you down, rascal. - Is this why you came home often? - Mother? I have served you food with these hands. - Mother! - Mongrel! Mother, why do you bother them? And what kind of a grown man gets beaten up like this? His little union game! Scoundrels! May you all drop dead! - Mother, come here. - Hey, leave me. - Mother, please come here. - Hands off, you! Here, this is your ikka's doing. Why don't you hit him too? Come on, beat him up. What is this? If you dare come home calling me Mother I swear I'll break your leg. Where is that goon? He will be beaten to death on the streets. Not even a dog... Kaachi! Mother, Kaachi is here. Kaachi dear? She has a fever. "Allah, offer me the protection of your brave Badr Martyrs" "When one has no friends on the Judgment Day" "Allah, offer me the protection of your virtuous Badr Martyrs" "When the deeds of one's life are weighed" "Allah, offer me the protection of your beloved Badr Martyrs" "When the hell boils with rage" "Allah, offer me the protection of your great Badr Martyrs" Hurry up. You come here. Come on. Do it quickly. The supply is down, Mother. Be quick, girl. Didn't I tell you to hurry? Now take it. Mother? - Here, take this water. - No. We have some water at home, Mother. Mother told me to give you. Joseph Chaanikunju Eraveli Vincent Antony PK Kunjus PT Sukumaran - Tokens are over. - That's it, you can go. Here, take it. And keep complaining about us. It's been a while since I moved my limbs. Shall we carry a few sacks? Are you nuts? Do you really want to work? No, you are right. Hey, Hamsa. Hurry up. Or I won't give you a Token next time. Move faster, man! The next ship is on its way. Ismail - four anna for ferry... and eight anna for food. Balance three rupees eight anna. Why was I denied a Token today? Did you refuse to pay the special fee? I gave it already. - Did you say you won't give? - Yes, so what? - Did you argue? - Can't we argue? You shouldn't argue, you rascal. I'll kill you... Olakka? - Kill this son of a dog! - Let go of me. Thrash him! Start the car, man. Hey, Pacheekk! Get off the car. Let me get a good look at you. Don't you read the papers, Pacheekk? Times have changed. Our union isn't banned anymore. You brute, if you ever mess with us again... you will be dead. Clear off! Didn't I tell you to get going? 'We will fix you in time' 'Pacheekk, the police Pacheekk, the police' 'We will fix you in time We will fix you in time' They can't beat Santo at any rate. One daring man is enough to bring them all down. Kaachi? What happened, Mother? Look at my child's face. That sore refuses to heal. Did you see Moidu today? Tell him to look for Kachi's husband. Moidu? Do you want me to say it aloud, Mother? Who is responsible for this? Now who is here to take care of it? Moidu? Or that sailor? See, it's short of a rupee and half. You had better leave. Are you the Jew? Don't you remember how much I gave you last time? Don't bargain with me. Find someone of your own standing. I'll give you later. I have no money now. How long have we known each other? I'll give. When? Soon enough. Hey, Moidu. We will have to go smuggling. Oh God! What is it? Why did you come here? - I would have come home. - When did you last come home? I don't want to go to that hell. Kaachi is very ill. She needs to see a doctor. Give me some money, son. I don't have a penny with me. Where is he? Why don't you ask him? - Move. - Moidu? By Allah, I have no money, umma. We need dictators here. What we really need is the mercenary force of Travancore. Every local goon should be recruited to the police force. Is this the guy, Pacheekk? Do you think this fellow can do it? Yes, sir, he is smart. Smart? If you had such smart men with you how could Santo rough you up? I know he can do it. You come with me. We need our militia here. They will get rid of all the Communists. He insulted me in front of everybody. Weren't our guys there? Those guys are useless. What should I do? Finish him off. Pacheekk! You go now. I'll see you later. Hey you! What is going on there? Put it there and get lost. We are paid peanuts despite working hard from dawn to dusk. Now the union also wants a share of that measly sum. Only CTTS supporters are hired to work. If we protest, they flog us... insult us. They treat us like mere dogs. We don't want their chaapa. What we need is job security. Our union submitted several petitions highlighting these issues. But it's been of no use. The port secretary turns a blind eye. The stevedores nods his head. Their henchmen thrash us. This has to end now. We can do it, if we stand together. Either we live and die like this. Or we fight for our rights. It's up to you to decide.

'Long live workers' unity' Stop. Hey, stop. That's enough. Stop. Hey Moidu, don't create trouble. We are going to meet the port secretary. You get out of the way. Moidu, we are all workers. We earn our food working here. These shipping companies are trying to turn us against each other. Why do you dance to their tunes? Get out of the way. If we fight, you will die. You will not meet the union secretary. This port needs only one union. Kill those pigs! Beat him! 'Thrash! Thrash!' 'Kill! Kill!' 'Thrash, Kill..' 'Thrash, Kill..' 'Thrash, Kill..' 'Kill, Kill, Kill' 'Kill, Kill, Kill' 'Thrash, smash' 'and bash to death' Olakka, he is beating up Moidu. - Come and get him. - Get him, Turk.

Here you go. There will be a raid at your home tomorrow. So stay away. We will arrest you if we find you there. What the heck did he say? You need us to do away with your enemies. But once the job is done, we are cast out. Pacheekk... Get him out of here. - That's enough drinking. - Come on. You are crazy to entertain rogues like him at home. Come with me. What is wrong with you? Give them two bottles. Olakka... He shouldn't be here anymore. Take him away. - Come on, let's go to the union office. - Yeah, let's go. Come on, man. One should never drink with a policeman. He is such a rascal! Rascal! Moidu, I'll see you tomorrow. Sister... Sister... - I had a dream. - Of what? The ship. The sea is beautiful, sister Won't he come back? He is also sick. Ummani? Did you check if there's water in the tap? Hamsa, is there no work today also? Mother... This is all I got today. So you didn't get work today also? Kaachi! Umma? Kaachi! Allah! Kaachi? Kaachi? - Kaachi, my dear child. - Mother, let's go to a hospital. Kaachi... - Kaachi? - Shall we get her to a hospital? Kaachi. Mother, let me see if I can get some money. Can you lend me Rs. 10? It's urgent. - I've nothing to pledge. - Then you don't get any money. - Go away! - Please, in the name of Allah... It's for a hospital case. Nuisance! I get no respite. Wait. Do you know the interest rate? You better settle it soon or I'll come after you. She is in a bad condition. Syphilis tertiary stage. Okay, doctor. Get up. Listen, it's the last stage. - What? - She is in a bad condition. I've prescribed some pills. Buy them from outside. - Let's see... - Hey! - Sister? - Yes. - I didn't follow him. - The girl has the Slut's Pox. Allah! My daughter? Don't talk rubbish. Take this and get out of here. If you don't live decently you will rot to death. Call the next patient. What did my child do? Mother... What happened, Mother? What is it? What did the doctor say? Where is Mother? Where is Mother? You came here to steal. Then why do you want mother? I asked you where mother is. I don't know, you find out. Hamsa and Mother took Kaachi to hospital. What happened? Kaachi fainted. Stop. Tell me what I should do. Should I go away? Or jump into the sea and kill myself? What should I do? What kind of a man are you! Who do I have here? I don't feel like coming here. Why not? I don't have the heart to. You have the heart to visit brothels. But you don't have the heart to visit me, right? You have no time, no heart... Look at me! Tell everyone that Ummani is dead. Moidu ikka! What are you doing, ikka? - Moidu ikka! - Come closer. Don't you have a problem coming to me now? Have you lost your voice? Ummani... You are one hell of a woman! Ummani? Mother! Come to grandma's home. I'll also come there. This isn't the right place. Go. I'll bring you something to eat. Are you here to see me? Ummani, you better catch him or he will fly away. What is it with you? What do you mean? Mind your own filthy business. Who is into filthy business? You or I? How long since you came home? I'll come and go as I wish. Who are you to ask that? - Don't you know who I'm? - No, civildore, I don't. You are a rascal! You make me sick. Hey! Mind your words or else... Or else what? I'll sort you out, you pig! Hey! Who is Ummani to you? Why did you bring her here? Who the hell do you think you are? If you have a problem, just throw her out. - How can I throw her out? - Oh yes! How can you? I know you fancy her. - Go to hell, you pig! - Mother! Moidu! Is this why you came? Who are the Communists fighting against? We fought against the British and gained independence. What is the purpose of this strike? The shipping companies and workers are part of a large family. That's why NTUC... is trying to foster a new work culture among workers. Don't you see... where the Nehru government is leading India to? Now they have launched the Five-year Plan. If we stand together there will be no more strikes. And the time will come when workers and bosses will live as one. If this contract is enforced we will lose all the jobs. Then how will we live? There is no other way before us. On one side is the NTUC union that betrayed us... and on the other is the spineless CTTS union. If Bharata Ratna and Sagara Rani refuse to hire us... the new union members should not be allowed to work with them. Our union has a right to work on both the ships. We should be hired too. Until then nobody should go to work. Let everything come to a halt. Let all loading and unloading works stop. Only then will the bosses learn a lesson. Let them know how powerful the Kochi port workers are. Who did they ask before signing the deal? Did they ask us? These union leaders think that they own us. They act like the bosses. They have a tacit understanding with the ship-owners. They have become contractors of loading and unloading They are making money. They ride on motorcars. Let all loading and unloading works stop. They will need us when their cash flow stops. Union leaders indeed! - Get out of my way! - You will have to kill me first. Move, you! - I said, move. - Hey, stop it! Get lost, you pig! Move! Get off me, you pig! - By Allah, I'll stab you. - By Allah, do it. - I swear by Allah, I'll do it. - By Allah, do it. - Kill me! - Move! - By Allah, I'll kill you. - By mother, you do it. By mother, I'll cover you in a shroud. Then do it, man. Kill me. Answer it, man. You agreed to take care of everything. You keep hanging out with such useless fellows. Such a nuisance! Didn't you take on that job? Could you do it? What the hell can you do then? Shameless fellow! Why do you look at Pacheekk? Look at me. Hey... look at me! Can you do it? If you can't, then tell me. I can get men to do the job. Do you want to see it? Oh, men indeed! Then do it yourself, sir. Stop it! - Did you hear what he said? - Shut up! Get out. - Ikka? - Get out. I said, get out. (Labours chorus) 17 Kunjaappu 20 Hamsa 13 Paulo If the strike goes on, we will lose whatever work we have. - But what they say is true. - That doesn't matter. Do you know what this is for? Look who is over there. Do you owe money to the Jew? Then why don't you give it back? You come begging when you need money. But you can't pay it back. We will be around for a few days. You should give us the money as and when you are paid. Got it? Let's go. Hamsa? Where were you? Aren't you joining us? Come, Hamsa, let's go. If you don't come today then when will you? Come on, man.

Don't worry, man. Be strong. Brother... Sell this bangle. Don't you have to take Kaachi to hospital? What the heck is this? Did someone die? One is sulking over there. I'm not sulking, man, I'm just tired. Don't you want a drink? My stomach is upset. Moidu? Sir is calling you. Who? Peepli sir wants to see you. What the hell? Does he want to get even with me?

Why did you get into it, Hamsa? Now you are doing it too. I've lost my peace of mind. Some big shot union leader! Hamsa? You take Ummani to grandma's house. Does she want to go, mother? Will he take care of her? Have you packed your things? Hamsa will take you there. Grandma? Grandma? - Grandma? - Hey! Call louder. She is hard of hearing. Grandma? This is brother's girl.

Kunjahamed He wanted to keep everything to himself. Where? From now, our unions will have equal work share on Bharata Ratna and Sagara Rani. The strike will end with this. Why strike now? Will there be any trouble? What trouble? Leave it to us. Do you know what is happening here? Comrades... The shipping company officials and union leaders are conspiring. Only those two unions are hired now. We are left to starve. Remember why those goons attacked Santo Gopalan. He is still bedridden. Why did he risk his life? He did it for all of us. So that we had food to eat. CTTS goons attacked him following orders from the shipping company bosses. Where are they now? They are at their bosses' house. They are drinking and having fun. They are trying to unload cargo secretly. But we won't let it happen. Nobody will unload cargo here anymore.

I'll kill you, pig... - Moidu! - Catch him! - Let go of me. - Moidu, stop! - I'll kill you. - Stop it, Moidu. - Moidu! - Let go of me. - I'll kill him! - Stop it, Moidu. Let him go. Leave me... I'll kick the hell out of you. Do you want to get beaten up? I have told you so many times. Don't hang out with such useless fellows. Do you have any money? Brother... Ummani is at grandma's place. Why don't you visit her? Brother... You should come home. Mother will be really happy. Can you just shut up? Kaachi is very ill. She is confined to bed. She needs to see a doctor. Moidu, don't hold a grudge against me. We have been friends since childhood. What is it? Nothing I don't know what I should do. Trapped? Is that so? Yes, you're trapped. If you let yourselves loose like this you will rot to death. Not even a dog will care for you. Isn't there a girl waiting for you? Go and have a good life with her. Go! I said, go. Go. Don't stay here. Only PCLU raised its voice against the token system that drove workers to fight like brutes. We will continue with this strike. There is a meeting here at Khosa Bungalow tomorrow to discuss the Sagara Rani issue. They have invited the other two unions. But he didn't invite our union, comrades. We have to continue with the strike until we're invited.

I'll go with you. Come on then. Have you ever been inside a Russian ship? It's huge! There will be good women too. They are savages though! Come on, throw the hook aboard. What are you staring at? Just do it! - Stop there! - One of them is coming! Hey! Catch! Back off! Back off or I'll rip your guts out. Move! Go and check. Is he breathing? No, he is dead. Throw him into the water. Syedali? What? Gangadharan asked us to go to Khosa company. Why? Comrade Abu has been invited for the meeting. Then they will arrive at a decision today. How long since we have worked? Let's go at once. Ikka?
