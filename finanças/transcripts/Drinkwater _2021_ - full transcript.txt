Hey, Hank, uh, you know how much longer are you gonna wear that? Just till the cheques stop comin'. Right. Yeah, it's just we're home now, you know? Nobody's gonna see ya. The only people that come over here are Cliff and Linda. I feel like it's unnecessary. Don't you underestimate those insurance surveillance guys. I wouldn't be surprised if one of them sneaky bastards is peaking through the window right now. You know, Hank, I think you're taking this a little bit too far. Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike. I've told ya, if we lived in a fair and just society I wouldn't have to carry on this charade. Right. Nobody appreciated the 20 years of back-breaking work that I endured at the mill. So no, I don't think that I am taking this... too far. Ok. Yeah, well, you know... You know best, so. Still feel like you're taking it too far, but... [knock at door] [knocking] I see you've unpacked. Yeah. Getting there. I was gonna make some lunch. Ham and cheese ok? Yeah, that's fine. Thanks.

Uh, so, um, I hear that your granddaughter's living with you guys right now. Linda told me. Yeah, Wallace, she's great. Like to meet her? Uh, nah. I'll just... Wallace! Oh, all right. Wallace! Wallace! Wallace, this is our next door neighbour, Mike. Nice to meet ya. You too. Uh, I, I hear that you just moved in. Yeah. Still unpacking. Uh-huh. You know, come Monday, it's Wallace's first day at Pen High. Why don't you give her a ride and show her the ropes, you know? What do you say? Uh, yeah. Ok. Cool, yeah. I leave at 7:45.

A bit of a change, but I'll get used to it. [Mike] Where are you from in the States? [Wallace] New England. [Mike] Oh, big apple. Nice. [Wallace] Uh, yeah. Pretty big change.

[Ms. LeBlanc] All right class, today we are going to be discussing the physics of... Flight. The physics of flight. More specifically, looking at the equations behind the Bernoulli Principle. So, how come planes can fly upside down? [Ms. LeBlanc] Air pressure across the wing... Do you have something to add, Monsieur Drinkwater? Yeah. Uh, I was just wondering if you could potentially clarify the role played by the angle of the attack of the wing and the interplay between thrust, drag and downward air deflection? It just seems like that should be covered. [class laughing] As I was saying, the Bernoulli Principle- How do you know all this? [whispers] Hank was really into planes for about a month. So we talked a lot about it, we learned a lot about the physics... Um, allo? Would you like to share your conversation with the class? Uh... not really. I was just wondering why planes can fly upside down, because, you know, it's kind of common knowledge that the Bernoulli Principle doesn't really fully explain flight and I just feel like, you don't really have any idea, you know, what you're talking about. [class laughs] Are you trying to get smart with me, hm? Uh... no. It sounds like you're questioning the legitimacy of my lectures. Yeah. Yeah, I am. Go see Principal Fraser. Ok, yup. [tapping on desk] [Hank] I know where it is. [Secretary] Have a nice day. Well, this had better be good. [crash] To scoot all the way over here and they're tearing up the sidewalk there on Windsor Street. Super bumpy. Nice to see you again, Mr. Drinkwater. No, no, no, don't butter me up. Now why am I here? Your son had a bit of an altercation in class today. What's "a bit" of an altercation? You either have one or you don't. Well, whatever you want to call it, it was the usual, challenging his teachers and being generally insulting towards them. Ok, I didn't mean to be... And don't, don't interrupt when we're talking about your altercations. As I was saying, according to Ms. LeBlanc, he was challenging her teaching methods and referred to her as "stupid". Ok, no, I didn't call her stupid. I called her reliance on the Bernoulli equation to explain lift stupid. Oh, come on. They're not still teaching that? Surely she explained the... the ratio between the angle of attack and the aspect ratio of the wing. No, that's exactly what I was trying to say. She wasn't saying any of that. She didn't know what she was talking about. She was going on and on... Wow. What has happened to the education system in this country? If we could just calm down, please. I think it would be best for Michael to just listen to his teachers and show some respect. His teachers. Oh, oh, cue the choir. Oh, here we go again. You want all these kids to conform to some, to some socialist agenda that stifles creativity and turns them all into mindless robots. And you get paid a pretty penny for it, I might add. Oh, you people. You think it's your God-given right to rip off the government. Well, as a hard working Canadian taxpayer, I have had it up to here. I'm not going to sit here and watch the intellectual and creative life of my son get sucked out his ass by a bunch of entitled educators. Come on, lad. Don't let these brainwashed ass... freeloaders get under your skin. [Hank] Freeloaders! - Uh, do... Should I? - Yep. Ok. Oh, hold on. - Should I close it. - Yes. - Close it or open it? - Close the door. I'm gonna close this. [sighs] [whispers] Oh my, oh my, oh my. Fucking Drinkwaters. [P.A.] Attention shoppers, remember... [honks] No, no, no. No, no. Get the, get the chocolate milk. Hank, I thought you were lactose intolerant. I know, I know. I'm working on my tolerance. All right, well I don't think that's a good idea. I think we should go with the kefir or nothing at all. I hardly call that the Sophie's Choice of chocolate milk. All right. We're going with the kefir. Ok, so what else do we need? We got bacon, eggs, Dunkaroos. Uh, must have lost the list. My sports hydration powder was on there. I need that to balance my... That's not in the budget. Well, if I can avoid another hammy cramp while training, we can afford it. Hey, um, you know Hank, since we're talking about money and stuff. I applied to a couple universities. Just, you know, 'cause there were deadlines. And I was sort of wondering about our financial situation, whether we had anything kind of socked away or... You're still thinking about university? Well, yeah, you know I don't want to get stuck here. You don't want to spend the best years of your life stuck in a classroom either. Right. Well, what would I even do here? Get a job. You could live in the house with me for free. Well, not, not free, you know, you gotta pay a little rent. So that's a no then on the money. There's nothing, nothing socked away? That's a big no? Your mom took most of it when she left and not, not took, I gave it to her. You know, she wanted this new life... Hank, though that was five years ago. And let me guess, you spent the rest of your money on stupid shit? I did not! Not most of it. You know, I still send her some, here and there. It's hard to save. Why don't you just take off your neck brace, stop faking it, and go back to work, that way we'd actually have some money. [chuckles] I'm in too deep. You're telling me. Butterscotch. Nice. [Cliff] Fifteen for two? Fifteen for four. Fifteen for six. Three of a kind. Twelve. [sighs] Who threw the five in there? That's an easy count. - Cliff. - Huh? What? What? She's bored. She's not bored. I'm a little bored, Grandpa. Back in the days when your mom and I... [sighs] [phone vibrates] Oh, she got herself a distraction device. We have a Jetson over here, eh? Jetson? How old are you? How old are you? Excuse me. Tell em you're getting hosed over here! Cliff. What? Hello. [Mike] Hey, Wallace? Hey. What's up, dude? [Mike] It's Mike. Mike Drinkwater. Your neighbour? Yeah, I know who you are. [Mike] Right. Right. Um... so, are you busy later? Not at all. So, um... [clears throat] What are we... what are we doing here? Uh, I like the scenery. It's a hockey rink. Yeah. Oh, the girl from the truck. Uh, who, Danny? Yeah, I think she figure skates here, or something. [Wallace] Are you stalking here? [Mike] What? No. No. Stalking's what crazy people do. No, no, no. I'm not stalking. I'm, I'm... more just seeing her at a higher rate than what would be considered statistically random. What? What? It's not stalking. It's not stalking. Ok, it's like a gentle stalking. It's like a, like a soft, it's like a soft stalk, kind of. It's more like a mathematically derived meeting technique where I increase the likelihood of having positive social interactions by subtly rearranging my schedule so that I'm in close proximity to the person of interest without being too obvious. Which, as I'm saying right now, does sound like stalking. Which is a bummer. It's actually a lot of work. Time tables and maps. [Wallace] She has a boyfriend. The douche in the truck. Yeah, well, you know. Nothing lasts forever. You should make friends with her. What, make friends with Danny? Are you kidding me? Look at her, she's a total babe. She's got babe-itis. I can't get near her, I mean, she's... Number one, she's president of the student council. She's in like six different clubs. She's super popular, she gets straight As. You know, girls like that don't, don't talk to guys like me. Maybe you should join student council? You know, get to know her, stop doing whatever this is. Student council? I don't know, isn't that a little bit weird? And stalking is what, normal? Ok. I see your point. It's a good point. I'll take it into consideration. This place is kind of a big deal in Canada. Feels like a Dunkin'. This is not a Dunkin'. Hi. [Cashier] Ok, dear. That'll be $9.44. Also, I'm a member. Oh, dammit. - One sec. - Ok. Can you hold that? Did you see it? [Mike] Dammit. - Just one sec. - Ok. [Mike] Oh, man. It's really down there. Um, do you want some help? Oh, I think I got it. Ok. [struggling] Oh, I'm close. I think I got it. I lost it. Oh, look, a loonie. Um... Do you want me to pull forward? Oh, I got some good leverage. One sec. Maybe I could look on my side. My foot's caught in the wheel. [horn honking] Ok. - Oh, I got it. - Ok. [Mike] I can't get it. No? Ok. [Mike] Can you help? So... is this one of your moments? Yeah, I guess it is. [cars honking] [horn honking] [Customer] Come on! Let's move it! Woo. Oh, nice. Great service. Thanks. Ok. Well, I'll see you tomorrow. - Ok. - Ok. - Bye. - Bye. Hey, you having a good time with Mike? Yeah, he has his moments. [Chuckles] Wally? Um... how is everything? I mean, you know, how are you doing? I'm fine, Grandma. You don't need to keep asking. [sighs] Uh, hi. Is this the student council? Uh, yeah. Ok. Is it too late to sign up? Sign-ups were months ago. For the student council? So, yeah, it is too late to sign up. Ok. Uh, whom... whom do you report to? I would like to speak on this matter with them. Danny's the president. Be my guest. Ok. Ok. Oh, hey. Hi, Madam President, I am interested in becoming involved with and around the student council. Oh, really? Why is that? Well, uh, you know, uh, politics are cool and I've been to counseling. Look, I don't... Uh, please, please can I be in the council with you please? Actually, Althea was supposed to be working with Patrick on the dance committee, but he came down with a really bad case of bowel polyp so, um, she could use some help planning the fall ball. No, I don't. Yes, you do. Fine. Ok. Cool. Uh, so when is, when will be the subsequent... the next meeting? Tuesdays and Thursdays, during lunch. Great. That's what I thought. Ok. Thank you very much, Madam President. [hopeful music] [dramatic music] [grunts] [crash] Holy mackerel. Well, you're getting better. You know sarcasm is for the weak, Hank. Is that a Bruce Lee quote? No. "Be water". That is a Bruce Lee quote. What kind of advice is that? Hey, I think, I think I'm gonna take Wallace to the Vees game. Who's Wallace? Uh, Cliff's granddaughter. From next door. I thought it was just gonna be a boys night? Every night is a boys night. You know, actually, sorry, most nights you're just working on Hank's world. Yeah, well you would too if your world was being overrun with killer sharks and dinosaurs. Oh, hey, hey. Speaking of hockey. This arrived, not two hours ago. Have a gander at that bad boy. You kidding me? It's pretty cool, eh? Hank, when I said not to buy stupid shit, this is stupid shit! - Stupid shit? - Yeah. - This is not stupid shit. - This is stupid shit! You have no respect for tradition. Put her in the fridge. I thought I raised you right. So? Do you love it? Absolutely, yeah. I hear shoulder pads are coming back. It was mine when I was young. Your mother even wore it to her prom. Even though she fought like hell not to. I would fight like hell if I had to wear that. Thanks, Grandma. [phone vibrates] Hello. [Mike] Hey, Wallace, it's Mike Drinkwater, your neighbour? Dude, you drive me to school every morning. [Mike] Oh, right. - Listen, you want to go to... - I'd love to. [footsteps approaching] Are you ready for tonight? Yes, sir. Should be a good game. I expect Vernon's coach to match you with the top D man. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be ok. Woah, don't get cocky. Hey, you need to bring your A game tonight. You got a lot of eyes on you now. Yeah, I know that. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Yeah, I don't know if you do. There's handfuls of scouts at these games. You have opportunity now, son. But your young, dumb. And opportunity doesn't stick, do you understand? It's slippery. You gotta grab it when you have the chance. You have to appreciate how much I've invested in you. And you need to give me a good return on that investment. Yes, sir. Got it. What's our goal? Division 1 American College hockey scholarship. What's our goal?! Full ride, D1 scholarship, NHL draft. Good. Good luck tonight. I thought you didn't believe in luck. Ah, bad luck is because of poor habits. Good luck is different. It's an unexpected bonus for being correct. I have a lot of good luck. [Hank] Come on, now! Come on! Come on! [Hank] Did you bring it? [Mike] You've asked me that like six times. [Wallace] Bring what? [Wallace] What is that? It's an octopus. Hank wants to throw it on the ice at some point. You can't be serious. Yeah, it's uh, like a tradition or something. I don't really... honestly I don't really know. You're not into hockey? Uh, you know, it's cool when they fight. - Oh, there he goes. - Come on. Gentle stalker, party of one. God, she looks good tonight. Hey, um, I signed up for the student council, like you said. Oh. Yeah, so, you know, hopefully that works out. [horn blaring] - [crowd cheering] - [victory music playing] [Announcer] Scoring his third goal of the night for the Penticton Vees, number 7, Luke Ryan! [Wallace] Why are they throwing hats? [Mike] If you score three goals it's called a hat trick. [crowd cheering] Now, now! Do it now! Throw it! What, you want me to throw it? Yes, you. A disabled person can't perform a throwing motion. Jesus. Uh, I think it's frozen. [Hank] What are you waiting for, do it! [thud] Oops. [Wallace gasps] [spectator] Dude, what was that? The dude's hurt. [whistle blows] [Mike] He's gonna be fine, right? Penticton, bench minor, unsportsmanlike conduct. Get a guy in the box. What the hell! Bullshit ref! [Wesley] He did it! The Drinkwaters! In the red. He did it! Well, hang on. Ok. It was an accident. Hey! [crowd booing] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hey, all right, you don't need even throw... All right. You try throwing a pus! Ok. They're getting violent. You ok, bud? I didn't do nothin'. I'm coming, I'm coming. I'm sorry. [Hank] That's my son. [Mike] I'm sorry. Get some of those hats, would you? Sorry everybody, sorry. [Hank] t's part of the game, for God's sake! - Sorry. - It's a part of... Ok. Oh sure, everybody throws a hat. We throw one octopus. [horn blaring] [crowd booing] [Announcer] Vernon wins four to three... Clearly, you give no credence to the legend of the octopus. Eight tentacles, eight wins. The Stanley Cup. Yes, sir, I know the legend. Then how can you show so little respect? Sir, I respect the tradition of the octopus as much as the next guy, but your son threw a frozen octopus at an official. It was frozen? There's too much shit in the fridge. Do you know that they have three hearts? That means they can love three times as much as we can. [Wesley] Hey, Drinkwater. Oh. Apple doesn't fall too far from the tree, huh? Maybe you should try and get a grip on that boy of yours, 'cause whatever you're doing right now ain't working. Are you calling me a bad father to my son, in front of my son? Uh, based on your track record being a poor student, a poor husband and probably the worst goalie I ever played with, I'd say that's a safe bet. I was a decent backup in '89 and you know it. Huh. And look where that got ya. The mill. Oh, Mr. Big shot. Had a cup of coffee in the AHL and now he gets to pick on the joe locals. Your parents must be so proud. I played in the Calder Cup. More like sat in the press box. I sat on the bench. Yeah, I remember. You seen my house? My dealerships? That's what real success looks like. I don't care about money. Yeah, that's what people say who don't have any. I may not have your money, but I got something a rich prick like you would die for. And what's that? 1979, tops, Wayne Gretzky rookie card. Ballpark value? About $25K. You're a collector, aren't ya? You don't have that card. No chance. Gettin' her appraised as we speak. Bullshit. What, you think I'm the guy that's gonna buy it? Buy it? I wouldn't sell that card to you. Are they really talking about a hockey card? Yeah. You know, Pisswater, that card would look real good in my collection. Speaking of cards, do I have to play the disability card here or what? - Hey, Pisswater? - Hey. You have a fun time at our game last night? Uh, yeah, I guess. Did you guys win? Listen, smart-ass, your little stunt cost us the game. So I guess you guys lost, huh? You're lucky I don't kick your ass right here. Living up to your name. Oh, 'cause Pisswater. 'Cause of the pee. That's funny. How's it going? I pissed my pants. How are ya. Hey, I pissed my pants. [Student] Yeah, you did dude. All right, come on in, Mike. Grab a seat. Now, brought you in here 'cause I think I have something for ya. I didn't know you wrestled. Mike? I just said I have an opportunity for you. It's just kind of hard to picture you wearing that spandex. Mike... That's 'cause that's not spandex. It's rayon. Rayon's a man's material. Look, I... I just said I have an opportunity for you. You played puck too? Huh? Yeah. '89 Vees. Used to be the Knights. Oh, so you played with Hank? Yeah, oh yeah. Best backup goalie we ever had. And him and Wesley Ryan, they used to go at it every day. Now I can see that that rivalry has been passed down to you. Yeah, yeah, unfortunately it has. Well, the CanAm Classic is coming up and I think you should be in it. A race? Running? Yeah. I... I... I hate running. Come on, who hates running? Everybody loves running. Your dad loved running. My mom loved it too. She loved it so much she ran out on us. Is that a good enough reason? Yeah. That's a pretty good reason. [clears throat] Awkward pause. Look, this race is a big deal, ok? I mean, we get American schools coming up here and those boys know how to compete. I don't know, Babber. Look, the winner of the CanAm Classic also gets a $10,000 scholarship. I don't even know if I'm gonna go to university. Woah! Time out. Right there. What are you gonna do? Sit on your duff down at the rink, driving the old Zamboni? Well, I mean, I haven't been accepted. I've applied to like six different universities. No one wants me. No, no, no, hey. Someone's gonna want ya, all right? Rejection's just a part of life. It's ok. You let it go. I mean, come on, look around, I teach gym. I got rejection cornered.

Back to class. Oh, you do know that Luke Ryan runs this race every year. Just a thought. Hm. Yep, I am good. Hank, you got a package. Woohoo! I've been waiting for this, baby.

I know, you've told me. And look, they graded it. 8.8. [laughs] Holy shit! It's bigger than my Bobby Orr. Yeah.

Yeah, he used to work at the mill and they were doing cutbacks and he figured he was going to get laid off so he faked an injury to collect the insurance cheques. So now he just kind of sits at home working on Hank's World and training for an Iron Man race that he's probably, probably never going to compete in. That's why he wears that neck brace all the time, 'cause he's worried he's gonna get caught ripping off the government. So, that's why he's always looking out the window? Uh, mmhmm. And why don't you call him dad? Uh, he's not really a dad. You know, he's more of a Hank. We actually used to be a family but my mom left when I was 12. She couldn't deal with Hank anymore.

[phone vibrates] Um, sorry, can you just hold that thought. - One second. - Oh, yep. [Danny] Luke? No. I uh, I'm just working on stuff for the party. Because it's, it's my job.

I don't mean this in a bad way, but are you a virgin? Am I a virgin? Nope. Nah, nope, nope. No, I'm not a virgin. I've had a girlfriend. And we had sex. I had a girlfriend last year. From Toronto. This big buxom Jamaican girl named Zelda. She had these lotions and we'd run them on each other and stuff. But she doesn't live here now, so you can't talk to her or meet her or anything like that. Why do you ask? Why would you ask a question like that. Are you a virgin? That's none of your business. All right, fine, then I won't tell you either. Uh, you already did. Yeah, I'm a virgin. I am.

I have no family. If I do the race, it's just gonna end up the exact same. That's bullshit. And what? Quitting is the way for you to feel good about yourself? Why do you care all of a sudden?

Yeah, I mean, I'm not gonna do it anymore. I... I tried to tell you. I... I... I tried but you wouldn't listen. You're too self-absorbed.

I know you're not here to purchase something. Got a minute? Walk with me. There is no luck behind what you see here. Built from the ground up. Ryan Motors has proudly serviced this town, this region for over 60 years. My father passed this company down to me and I plan to do the same to my son. That is, if he doesn't play in the NHL, of course. Yeah, yeah, your dad did a good job. What are you getting at? Everything I build, put my time into, is for my son's future. I assume you're here for the same thing. What's that supposed to mean? You're here to sell me the Gretzky card, are you not? Yeah. I figured. What's the money for? Mike got into university and I can't afford it. Isn't that what the race scholarship's for? He's not in the race anymore. Probably wouldn't be enough anyway. I would buy the card but I just don't want to. As you can see, I have everything I need. Maybe Mike should get back in the race. If not, I'm pretty sure we're hiring. Let's go. [Luke] What was that all about? Nothing. He wants a hand out but that's not what Ryans do. Mike quit the race? Who cares? You should be worried about hockey, not some silly little race. [crashes] [smashing] [smash] You were right. I haven't been much of a, of a dad to you lately. I haven't been much of anything really since your mom left. I can't have you end up like me.

[knocking] Look, man, I'm gonna make this quick. I shouldn't even be doing this. You kicked my girlfriend in the face. Yeah. I... I still feel really horrible about that. You're gonna race. And you're gonna come in second. This thing's not worth winning unless you're there to lose. Uh, thank you? Just... be there. All right? Tell Danny I'm sorry. You're not gonna tell her.

But please, don't ever be afraid of what you keep bottled up inside you, because that's not what your mother would want you to do. Because that's what she did. She was so incredibly strong.

Now, our first place finisher, also from Penticton Secondary, winner of the CanAm Scholarship and this amazing trophy, Mr. Luke Ryan. [cheering] My boy! All right. Really? Uh, just one second. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Ryan has just informed me that he'll be turning down the CanAm Scholarship as he's already received a full division one hockey scholarship to the University of North Dakota. Congratulations, Luke. That's quite an accomplishment. And this is quite a gesture. Well, I've just conferred with our race official and according to the CanAm rules, the CanAm scholarship is now awarded to our second place finisher, Mr. Mike Drinkwater. - Woo-hoo-hoo! - [crowd cheering] Turn that around. Told you to be prepared for yes. All right, give it up, let's go. All right. - Atta boy. - Thanks, man. It was a great race. The boy showed a lot of class up there, Wesley. Where'd he learn that from? All right, listen up. I know that money's not gonna be enough for Mike, not for four years anyway, so, why don't we take a look at that Gretzky rookie card of yours? It's a hell of a card. You got a hell of a son. Thanks. [Babbar] All right, give it up for our boys! Woo! Yeah! Woo! [cheering] Let's go! Shoot it. He's open! - [cheering] - [horn blaring] Woo! Good job. Good job. Hey, man. So, Mike, are you and Hank still coming for Thanksgiving dinner? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Should we bring anything? Oh, no, that's ok. So, how's university treating you? Um, it's great. It's great. Yeah. And it's not too far away so, you know, I can come back and visit Hank. [clears throat] And you know, somebody else. How come you don't kiss me like that? Oh, wait till we get home. So, did Wally tell you that she's going to the Nationals for the Canadian Debate Team? She did yeah, yeah. I can't believe someone would willingly go to Winnipeg in the winter. Come on, it can't be that bad. Wow, you've clearly never been to Winnipeg. In the winter. All right. Well, I'm gonna go to the restroom. Washroom. Nice, nice catch. Oh, actually, just wait one second. What? Just wait, wait for it. Mike, what? Wait, wait for it. Wait for it. Hey! My dad got a new job. Holy shit! That's awesome. Look at me, I'm riding the bone! [crash] [Hank] Oh! Jeez. [crash] Hit the post. [Mike] It's his first day. That's gonna leave a mark. First day! I should probably get him a helmet or some pads or something... I'm all right. He's, he's gonna be good though. Yeah. He's gonna be really good. [chuckles] Oh! Oh! Oh! Beats the hell out of that scooter. I'm good, I'm good. I'm good.
