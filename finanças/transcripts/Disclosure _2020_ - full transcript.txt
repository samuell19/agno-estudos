You taste so good. Oh my God, wait, wait. It's not recording. Stop. Oh, you taste so good. Okay. Okay, fuck me. - When? - Now! - When? - Now! Now? Fuck me! Now! Oh, fuck. Oh, God. Fuck me harder. Harder! Oh, fuck! Fuck! Oh, fuck. Oh, God. Oh, Mondays Ethan has swimming after school. What about Wednesday afternoons? Yeah, sure. Ethan? Ethan! Go outside! How many times do I have to tell you? Hi, Sarah. Leave the little ones alone. 5:30? Let me just check the kid's calendar, one second. Uh, 5:30. Oh, perfect! Great. Okay, we'll see you then. Buh-bye. You okay? Yeah. Just gotta get my breath back. I found Natasha asleep on the sofa this morning. She probably needed it. Yeah. I thought I'd leave her, but then she woke up and she said, "It's all right, Mom. "I'm not sleeping, I'm practicing meditation." I shouldn't of let her go to ballet. No, no. I think it's good. Keep a routine. Your mom's there if anything happens. She's gonna be okay, isn't she? She's gonna be fine. We'll find a good therapist. Oh, I could kill that little shit. Hey. She's a tough little egg, like her mom. She's gonna be okay. Can you get that? That might be Mom. No, it's Bek and Joel. Oh, yeah? Yeah, they're coming over. What, now? Hello? Oh, shit! Aw, shit! Oh! Just a sec, mate! Oh, God. Sorry. We saw the cars and just thought... No, no, no. We're here, come on down, yeah? Oh, this is Steve, by the way. Who? Just give me a sec, I'll explain. Honey! Towel! Oh, shit. Thanks. Hello? Hey there! Hi! We all clear? - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on down. Beautiful day for it, guys. Hi. Sorry about that. It's all right. These are for you. Oh, wow! They are beautiful. It's just dahlias from our garden. Thank you, Becca. I really appreciate it, they're really... Hey, sorry to parachute in on you like this. No. Oh. It's fine. Come on, take a seat. - Thanks, mate. - Sure. Cheers. Well, you look fabulous. Oh, stop it! Oh, no. We're going to a fundraiser later. It's a sculpture gallery. Yeah, Blue Rinse Brigade. Kind of assumed it wasn't your cup of tea. Oh, I actually find them endlessly fascinating. Is your friend joining us? Steve. Um... Joel's received a threat. What? Yeah, police think it's credible, so now we've got Agent Smith in tow. Oh, God. Joel, I'm so sorry. That's shocking. Look, I'm sorry for bringing this to your doorstep, it wasn't exactly planned. Is this to do with your army days? No, no. Lunatic fringe getting lippy about my stance on refugees. No way. Yeah, we're ruffling feathers, mate. Well, that'll teach you to get in bed with a lefty journo. Bek did always warn me about you. So, do we get protection? No, no, you're a hack, mate. And a socialist at that. As far as the state's concerned, you're expendable. What a surprise. Oh, I wouldn't worry. If that's the best they can do for a state MP... No, no, no, don't underestimate Steve. He's an experienced cop. At the end of the day, you just gotta get on with your life, don't you? Can I get you guys a drink? Oh, no, no. We can't stay very long. Thank you. Sure. Hey, is the launch still happening? Yeah. Yeah, we just got the word that the PM's arriving first thing in the morning to give the keynote. That is awesome. Yeah. It's huge. Congratulations, Joel. This is gonna make you. Well, it's a step in the right direction. Yeah, he's worked so hard for this, so. Well, federal parliament, here we come. We'll see. We will see, mate. Hey. It's fresh made. Oh, go on, then. How can I resist? Thank you. Bek? Uh, sure. Thank you. Nectar. Oh. You okay? Yeah. It's turning into a very long weekend, that's all. Yeah. Um, where's Natasha? Ballet. With? Oh, my mom flew down from Brisbane. Oh. Yeah, just helping out while... That's nice. Yeah. So, Natasha's okay then? Um, I think it's too early to tell. Sure, sure, sure. How are you guys doing? We're okay. Yeah? Yeah, we're okay, under the circumstances. Yeah. We're really feeling for you at the moment. Oh, we're really feeling for you guys, too. This whole thing, what a nightmare. And it's great that you guys have been so supportive. Yeah, well, we've always found in this community that support's there if you need it. We spoke to Ethan and Ben this morning. That's good. Yeah. We just feel really bad that we accepted what you told us without talking to our boys first. What do you mean? Natasha's story. Yeah? It just doesn't make sense. It makes complete sense. Look, Ethan swears that he didn't touch Natasha. Well, he would. Wouldn't he? Ethan doesn't lie. Neither does Natasha. Listen. I spoke to a child psychologist friend... Hey, mate, I thought we talked about this. She's a friend, and it was anonymous. She's in the U.S. But she was very clear, very adamant that four year olds don't make this kind of stuff up. Oh no, we're not saying... We're not saying that Natasha hasn't been subject to some kind of abuse... Right. Just that Ethan didn't do it. Right. Well, that's not right. Listen. We'd really like to support you and Natasha in any way that we can. And I've got the number here for this excellent child therapist that I know. Natasha names Ethan and Ben. She describes the layout of your house. She describes the toy sword which... The toy sword, exactly. The toy sword. The boys don't own a toy of that description. It just doesn't add up. She was struggling to find the words. I don't think that it's literal. Okay. Last night, Ben told me this story about how in the middle of the night he caught the bus to his friend's house, they had this magical feast, and then he caught the bus home. I mean, should we believe him? Well no, because that's his imagination. We know that Natasha is telling the truth, that's why we're taking this so seriously. Okay. Well, we believe Ben, who said that Ethan never touched him or Natasha. And Ben is showing zero signs of distress, he's just his normal, bubbly, mystical self. Bubbly. Yeah, yes, bubbly. Look, we appreciate how difficult it must be to hear what Natasha's had to say. Difficult? Difficult? Do you understand how upsetting these allegations are? But no one's making any allegations. The problem is, mate, you don't have any evidence. Well, Natasha's words are all that child protection needs. Oh, child protection. Serious? We're talking hypothetically. I am not talking hypothetically. Where are the injuries? Where's the hysterical child? She's at ballet. Okay, it was six weeks ago, Bek. Well, why has it taken six weeks for her to say something? Well, apparently that's very common in kids that age. They don't have the language to communicate an experience like that. And her behavior has clearly changed. You know what I just find completely heartbreaking, honey? That both of you would accept that my beautiful little boy has done these horrific things. All we've done is share our daughter's words with you. You, you of all people. Excuse me? I've spent nine years making sure that my boys had the childhood that was taken away from me. I have sheltered my kids, maybe too much. Ethan doesn't have the knowledge to even imagine such things, okay? He's a little boy. Okay, that's just naive... I know my son! He's probably just acting out something he saw on the internet. Danny, he doesn't have access to our computers, so. The last time that I was over babysitting, he was playing games on your desktop. As I said, we've just tried to tell you what Natasha has told us. I mean, did you want us to keep it to ourselves? No, of course not mate. But it's what Bek just said, that both of you just seem ready to judge our boy. Oh, no, no. No one's making nay judgments. We're just trying to keep you informed so that we can work out what's best to do. We appreciate that, mate, your honesty. But please, don't go threatening us with child protection over the basis of a four year old's story. It's not a story. No one's making any threats. Come on, you're our friends. You haven't got any evidence. Evidence? What do you want? Two male witnesses? Em. What was that? Nothing. Doesn't matter. Excuse me. Mark. Hey, buddy. I can't talk right now. Can I call you back in a few minutes? Half an hour max, yeah, okay. All right, mate. Thank you, bye. Look, it's great that you're taking what Natasha said seriously. We fully support you getting professional help for her. In fact, we're offering to help out with that. Bek knows some great people. Yeah. You just need to remove the names of our kids. That's all. I'm not removing the names. Please, Emily. Please, please. We're asking you as your friends. You know that Natasha told us more about what happened? What? I've typed it up. This is unbelievable. When Natasha started screaming, Ethan put his hands around her throat. Do you know how offensive that is? Yeah. Yeah, it is offensive. And then he put his hand across her mouth. What? He was trying to stop her from breathing. I'm sorry. These are the kind of fucked up things a pedophile would do. Not a sweet little boy. Okay, I'm not... He's... My son is not a monster, Emily. I know that he is not a monster, he's just a little boy. What do you want from us? Really? I just want you guys to accept that this has happened, and get some professional help for your boys, just like we're gonna get help for Natasha. I mean, what possible harm can come from that? Ethan didn't do it. He didn't do it, he didn't have time. Oh my God. I can't bare this, I'm going. Bek, come here. Bek, just wait! We're all adults, we can figure something out. All right? I agree. Come on, we're friends. Let's work this out amicably, please. I'm gonna get dressed. Look, maybe I'll put some snacks together. That'll be great, mate. Thank you. You guys just make yourselves at home. There's some beers in the eski. It's a bit early for me, but... That went down like a fat kid on a see-saw. Why are they doing this? Oh, fuck if I know. They're the ones that need to be in therapy. I mean, you were there. If Ethan had been sticking his grubby fingers up Natasha... Joel. Did you hear her scream? I mean, did you? It was six weeks ago. Em. You okay? Did you invite them in here to watch me piss as well? I'm sorry, I just got a shock, I wasn't thinking. That fucking bitch! I want to just smash her fucking face in. Hey! Hey. Come on. Come on. Hey. Come on. They're trying to gag us. They're not trying to gag us. They're in denial. That's not an excuse. It's hard for them to process. What about Natasha? And us? Hey. Natasha's resilient. And so are we. They implied that you are abusing our daughter. No they didn't. They didn't. They agreed that Natasha has been abused, but they won't admit that Ethan did it, so who do you think that they have in mind? I have no idea. And I don't think that they know. Oh God. So, what are we gonna do? Uh, we just have to persuade them. I'll talk to Danny, he's a reasonable man. You know, I thought Emily was a compassionate person. She is, you just need to reach out to her. Let's be smart about this, all right? Is that really necessary, babe? Yes, it is. It just looks... It looks what? It looks ridiculous. Well, you look ridiculous. Hey, mate. Yeah, no, it reads really really well. I've got a few suggestions. Just hang on a sec, just let me... Bek's all over it. Just give me a sec, mate. Here we go. Thanks. Yeah, page three. "We know that effective intervention, "change that to early intervention is crucial, et cetera." And "after stopping family violence, comma, "we're determined to set young people on the right path." Beauty. Cheers. First thing tomorrow I am going to go and call child protection. Em. I don't think that we can do that to them. Well, it's the right thing to do. If we call child protection, the police will get involved, social services, I mean, that's just too much. I mean, do we want that for Natasha? They won't even admit that Ethan did it! I know, I know. Bek of all people! Look, Bek is... She's damaged. I mean, God knows how she's processing all of this. It's completely unforgivable what she's doing. I'm sure it is not malicious. If Bek and Joel won't admit what's happened, if they can't admit it then we have a responsibility to intervene for the children's sake. Why are you so trusting that social services will get it right? I mean, you are usually such a skeptic. Well, it is the only way that we're gonna get anything done now! Look. Despite everything that they've been saying, they're gonna be watching Ethan's every move like a hawk from now on. Danny. He needs therapy, not more policing. They're a decent family. We have to trust that they'll do the right thing. Okay, like Bek trusted her dad to sort her step-brother out. Come on, that's a completely different situation. Oh yeah? What about Ben? I don't know. Yeah? What about Ethan? I don't know. What about Ethan's next victim? You know, every child at that school is at risk now. I don't know. Well, those are the consequences if they don't do anything! Well, we don't know that! Oh yeah? "My beautiful little boy." She makes me want to puke. Maybe taking the kids' names off is not such a bad idea. At least in the short term. Trust Joel to come up with that. Redact the children's names of a politician. Hear me out, Em. It means that we can refer Natasha to a therapist immediately. We can sort out all this other stuff later. It's not like we're dealing with a couple of ice addicts, is it? They are damaged though, Danny. You just said so yourself. God, I was warned about Bek two years ago. I've never warmed to her, that dark energy that she has. Should've trusted my instincts. They've treated us very well up until now. Joel's a good man. He's sound. Danny. That friendship or whatever it is, is over. Oh, come on. Do you need more of a reason? Well, listen, I'll decide when my friendship with someone is over, okay? Oh, okay. He is a bully, Danny. Just like his son. Emily. You are sounding like a complete zealot. Don't say my name like that. Like what? Like you're patronizing me, and I fuckin' hate it! I'm not calling child protection. Well, it's not about you. I never said it was. Why are you defending Joel? I am not def... I think his heart's in the right place. Choose a fucking side, Daniel! Yeah, mate. Just give us another half an hour, okay? Yeah, we're just solving a problem with some friends, that's all. Okay, call me anytime. Thanks mate, bye. What is taking these guys? How does Ethan know the password to your desktop? I didn't know he did. Emily just said that when she was over babysitting, he was playing games on your computer. Don't be naive, babe. He's a nine year old boy. Little shit probably knows more about computers than we do. All right, so he's probably found... Don't bring that up again. After all the protections that I put in place. Can we just stay our message, please? Did you really just say that to me? You can't protect him from the real world, babe. He's a little boy. We have a duty of care to protect him from that. It's not a fucking crime. Exposing him to that stuff, those images. You're okay with that? Keep your fucking voice down, keep your... Steve? Mate, can we just get some privacy please? A little bit further? Thank you. Look. Boys throughout the ages, for all time, in all countries, look at porn. It's everywhere. My old man, he hid his under the bed, now it's online. It's natural. What did our little boy find, Joel? Do you know, I read the other day that Peppa Pig is three clicks away from porn. It doesn't matter what preventions we put in place, Ethan's gonna find it on his own or with his friends, but it doesn't mean that every primary school boy who sees a bit of bonking is gonna go out and abuse his neighbor's four year old daughter. Ethan knows the difference, that's what we're teaching him. And how do you define a bit of bonking, Joel? Fuck, don't be prudish. Prudish? - Yeah, prudish. - Prudish? Yes. Grown men having anal sex with barely legal girls! Keep your voice down. Oh, what? I thought you said it was natural. Ethan didn't touch Natasha, so don't make a link because there isn't one. But you're happy for that to be his introduction to making love? Well, he's not gonna learn anything from us now, is he? Fuck. You're an asshole. These guys are into some weird, kinky shit. Natasha probably saw them at it, mixed it up in her little head, put it onto Ethan in her nightmares and coughed it up as some fanciful disclosure. Look, I don't give a shit how you jerk yourself off in your spare time, but after everything that I've done for you, after all the sacrifices I've made, I do not want you taking my little boy's childhood away. You have made sure that Ethan and Ben have an upbringing that you never had, and I salute you for that. You are doing everything in your power. Hell, they know that underpants rule inside out. They are living in a loving, safe household. They are. No. Ethan didn't touch Natasha. - I know he didn't. - Oh, God! I know he didn't, all right? That's all that matters. We're doing everything right, we're doing everything right. Billy. Yeah, mate. It's reading great. I just think it needs to be punchier, chief. We just need to focus on some of the key things, you know, just get some bullet points in there, strengthening communities, delivering early support, securing futures, you know, that kind of thing. I'm sorry. Look, whatever your feelings are on Joel, he's doing a lot of good work. I know. He's got the children and families portfolio, for fuck's sake. I'm sorry, Danny. But I don't think that's a good enough reason for us to not do anything. Look, Joel's out on a limb here. I mean, forget about some nutter making a death threat. He's got mainstream enemies queuing up to take him down. I mean, all it would take is one cop, one social worker, one bloody admin person at child protection to leak Natasha's statement and it would ruin him, guaranteed. It would discredit everything that he's done. If Joel can't take responsibility for the actions of his son, I don't think he has a right to be in government. Come on, Emily. You know it's not that black and white. What about his work with the refugees? Are you defending Joel now or your book? I am not gonna prioritize a book over the needs of my daughter. Or the needs of Bek and Joel's kids? Please, do not conflate the two. No, I think you're conflating the two. It's not about the fucking book! Okay. Then what? I'm sorry. I'm just worried about all of this getting out of hand. I mean, Joel and Bek, they're their parents. Can we please keep some perspective on this? Danny. If this were some friend of yours that had raped his wife and then raped me, would you be talking like this? My God. That is a ridiculous comparison. Is it? Yes, it is! Because we're talking about children, not adults. Because children aren't adults. Yeah, but they are human beings. And just because they can't express things like adults can doesn't mean that they haven't been traumatized in the same way. I know. I know. It's just if we pick a fight with these guys, you've gotta think through the consequences for Natasha and for us. I'm not picking a fight. Em, these guys are powerful. They know everyone in this community. You know, the same community that we moved here to be a part of. What? Oh, Christ. Sir. This is a private conversation. Fuck. If you're worried about being the bad guy, I'll take it out of your hands. That is not what I'm saying. Okay, then what? I don't know, Em! This just feels a little like revenge. Fuck. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just trying to make sense of this too, I'm sorry. I'm just doing this for the kids. I know. I know. I know. But, please, can we just try to just talk it out with Bek and Joel? Just see if we can bring them around amicably. Please, can we? Okay. Okay. Okay. But if that doesn't work, I am taking Natasha to a psychologist, and I'm giving them the transcripts, and I'm not taking the names off. And you need to support me on that. Em. Of course I support you. Of course. Of course. Look, if it comes to that, I think we'll regret it. But... Oof. Come on. Come on. What are you doing? Printing out the transcripts. Right. Transcripts of Natasha's disclosures. It's all verbatim. Joel? He should have that phone grafted to his ear. Should I take it down to him? Yeah. I mean, it'll get cold otherwise. See you in a sec. See you in a sec. I'm sorry I got angry. It's really difficult for Joel and I, honey. I can understand that. Bek, I really don't want this to impact on Natasha and Ben's friendship. I don't want this to impact on Ben or Ethan period. Well, have we decided on the wording of the communicate? We have? Well, it all sounds... Oh, fuck. Hang on a sec, mate. Can I just call you back in a bit? Yeah, I've just gotta sort something out. All right, thanks mate. Cheers. I'm sorry, mate. I think you just killed a fairy. I might've. Cheers. I'm sorry. Em's pretty upset. Ah, it's all right. It's shitty for us all. Maybe we should head up? No, no, no, no. Bek's got a healing candle out, we should give them some space. There is some of that circular talking. I'm a little bit scared to leave them alone up there. Yeah, it'll be all right. Oh, thanks for bringing the chainsaw by the way. Oh, it's all right, it's all right. Anytime. Why don't you show me the damage? Well, I fixed the pool fence already. Oh, wow. I didn't even notice. That was pretty crooked. Yeah, insurance paid. Broken pool fence is a priority, it seems. Right. And that is the remains of the tree. Fuck me. Lucky that didn't come down on your house. Tell me about it. Wait 'til you see the creek. It's like something out of a psalm. Listen, I forgot to say with all this going on, congratulations on your nomination. Thank you. Ah, it's very exciting. When's the ceremony? Middle of the year. I'll have to get you all dressed up then. You're so brave, making that. Mm, no. What do you mean? You risked your life to make that film. Just glad that the story's out there now. You risked your life. They were calculated risks. Oh, it was a war zone. I didn't know it was all gonna kick off when we started filming. Oh, of course. Silly me. How long were you gone? Was it three months? Oh. Tashy must of missed you so much. Yeah, it felt like a really long time. Mm. You're going again, right? Yeah. I owe it to Nas. She risked a lot more than I did. Wow. I'm sorry, I just can't understand that. Mm, mm. Come on, Bek. You're not gonna give me that bad mother bullshit, are you? Natasha's four years old, honey. I didn't know that you were so conservative about this. I don't think there's anything wrong with being conservative when it comes to your kids. I just... I can't understand how you can be so ambivalent about this. And if I was a man? Men aren't mothers. They have very different responsibilities. They're much freer than us to indulge in their stupid desires. I don't think that this is a great time for us to talk about this. Well, actually, I was hoping that this could be a safe space for us to be open and honest with each other about difficult things. Okay. Well, then, honestly... Why can't you believe that Ethan may have done this? Well, first of all, Ethan didn't have time to groom Natasha. There's no suggestion that he groomed her. He doesn't take any notice of her at all. Well, he's a child. Okay. Let me explain something to you. With my step-brother, we'd known each other for 10 years. I had a crush on him. I trusted him completely. And that is why I let him. That's why he could... Even when it ha... Even when it went bad, I still wanted him to love me. That's how these things happen, okay? Maybe because he was a teenager, I mean... I was a child. I know. And that's why I'm asking you, Bek, as a survivor. Believe Natasha, I mean, listen to her. Please. Like I said, Ethan's too young to even know any of this stuff. It's just impossible. It doesn't make sense. But maybe he's acting out something that he saw. No! Because the only place that he's been out of our sight for any length of time is at school, or with my sister-in-law or my aunt, both of whom I trust implicitly. So, it doesn't add up, I'm sorry. Something on the computer. He plays video games. He likes guns, and explosions, and Minecraft. He's a little boy, he's not interested in anything else. Is Joel still downloading porn? That was a one off. Bek, you told me that he was an addict. Okay. That was the Chardonnay talking. It was a one off, and you promised me that you would never mention that again. Bek. Okay. Can I be honest for a moment? Please. I think you're a hypocrite. We have parental controls on our computers. We know that it's not just kids' brains that get re-wired watching that shit. We're not addicts. But you do act out what you watch, yeah? There's nothing wrong with that, we're consenting adults. Don't you think it's more likely that Natasha's seen something? No, that doesn't follow. The psychiatrist that Jenny spoke to says that... She still sleeps in your room, honey. We do have other rooms, Bek. Well, I hope they've got locks on them. Fuck me. You're gonna need more than a chainsaw, mate. That's rooted. No shit. You don't have any access down here. I'm afraid you're stuck with that until it drops. Nothing I can do then? Widow makers. Sorry? It's what the early timber cutters called the gumtrees up here. Oh. Oh, well. Maybe I was never meant to have a boardwalk. What, you think some vengeful spirit did this? Fuckin' hippy. You know what the headline is for our briefing tomorrow? No. Hasn't been leaked? Not to me. Strong Families, Safe Children. Right. So you see, I need these allegations like a fucking hole in the head. Well, I can't help the timing. All I'm asking is that we keep this private between us. I'm asking you this as a friend. How? Simple. Minimize the disclosure. If you weren't a politician and I wasn't a journalist, would we be even having this conversation? You're killing me, you know that? Look, I'm sure we can work it out, but I have to put my daughter first. What, by parading my son in public? No, if we're discreet... Fuck off, mate. Don't treat me like a muppet. You know damn well that if this story gets out to a therapist and that triggers a mandatory report, it's just a matter of time before it leaks. It's not inevitable. Does Emily hate Bek? What? No. No, of course not. I mean, it felt like a fucking blame game up there. Look, I told you, Em's upset. Don't take it personally. Telling me what to do with my own son. That's my Emily. Bek, I know you believe in therapy, I mean you said it saved your life. So, I don't understand why you're being so resistant about the idea of the kids just going to speak to someone. Because I don't want Ethan to feel like he's done something wrong when he hasn't. You're making out that my son's a criminal. No, he's not a criminal, he's just a little boy. I actually prefer it if we didn't use this kind of emotive language. You're making assumptions that he's guilty. I am not criminalizing anyone. This is just about making sure that the kids are safe and well. Emily. Natasha's story is make believe. Was your story make believe? Absolutely not. 12 year olds aren't capable of lying? That's a completely different situation. No. It's exactly the same situation. You should've been believed. Natasha should be believed. That's how it should be. We are the victims here. Don't you see that? Ethan is my son. He's my flesh and blood, and that is why I know in here, I know he did not do this. Do you understand me? Did I tell you that my great grandparents were some of the first settlers here? No. Pitched their tent just to the east of the post office. Four kids. Right. 1890's depression. People in the city were starving, so the state government started off loaning crammed land to save lives. Really? I didn't know that. Yeah. You wouldn't know to look at it, but this land is littered with the graves of families that didn't make it. My great grandmother, she had this little Bible. And she wrote on the inside cover how despite all the horrors, they stayed strong. Our family started looking out for one another. When one of her neighbors died, my great grandfather brought the block next door so his widow and kids could survive. Right. The point is, Danny, this is the community I represent. It's a community whose codes of civil conduct were forged by the need to survive. By the need to trust your neighbors. In this community, you fly out those codes at your peril. Save the speeches for Parliament, mate. I know my rights in 21st century Australia, and I don't need a history lesson about the morals of the early European settlers whose values also included dispossession, rape, and genocide. Okay, well, if there is a vengeful spirit staring in your creek, don't say I didn't warn ya. Are you threatening me? Look. If I can't trust you on this, mate, then all deals are off. You understand? And that includes our fuckin' book. No, see. You're not talking about trust, Joel, you're talking about loyalty. Fuck loyalty! This is about our kids. All those documents, the refugee statements, the classified files of Afghanistan, they're all gone. Fuck you! They're all gone. All right? I protect my sources, you know that. But you won't anonymize a four year old kid's disclosure? My daughter has a name. Widow makers. Listen, Joel. You seriously underestimate me if you think that threats are gonna force me to compromise my daughter. I'm not threatening you, mate. Well, you could've fooled me. Look, can we... When it's cooled down over a couple of days, just until the other side of this launch, that's all. No, no. I won't delay getting help for... Well, there must be some way. Well, I'm all ears, mate! All right. All right, how about this. You remove the names off the statement, and we'll get our kids assessed privately somehow, we'll come up with some story. Including Ethan? Yeah, sure. For whatever it's worth, you need to remove those names. Okay. All right. Well, that could be workable. All right. I don't want us to fall out over this, mate. Nah. Me either. Okay. Let's go sell this to the girls. Stop being a fucking politician. It's a solution. No, it's not a solution. You're just trying to fix things. Ethan didn't do anything, so he doesn't need help. Ben has not been abused by anybody, let alone his own brother, so he doesn't need any help. It's a compromise. I thought we came here to tell these guys that Ethan didn't do it. Wasn't that the bottom line? Bek. No, don't "Bek" me. Why are men so fucking shit? Oh, here we go. Not all men. Thank you. I wasn't talking about you. Bek, please, if you're worried about this getting out beyond the four of us, this is a solution. How do we justify getting Ethan assessed? For what? By making up another bullshit story? I'm sure that there's a way that we can communicate truthfully what's happened. What? The truth according to whom? Natasha. I will not put my kids in therapy, end of story. I think you're making a real mistake... Do you understand that if my son had done any of these things, I could never... Do what, Bek? Just leave my children alone. Ethan needs help. Ethan didn't do anything. I think that in your heart... He didn't do it, and that is my final word on this disgusting allegation! Okay, I think we're done here. Wait, wait, don't go, don't go. Please. I need to use the bathroom. Okay. But you're coming back? Fine, but we are not making any deals. Okay, fine, please. Please, please? Fuck! Well, that's dead in the ass. I think I might have that beer, mate. IPA or lager? Lager. Em? Yes, please. Oh, fuck. Oh, shut up. It's good. Local microbrewery. It's crisp. I came across a pool just like this outside Teracott. We'd been tasked to retake a police checkpoint. And there was this villa, this ruin. The pool was bone dry, and... I found this man lying on the bottom, hugging the body of his wife. I remember he was stroking her hair like a lover. He wouldn't let her go. Later, much, much later, the translator managed to tease out a story for his sobs. I never heard a man wail like that. The Taliban had forced him to watch as they gang-raped his wife, cut off her hands, and then shot her in the head. All 'cause he was a policeman. The only reason they didn't behead him was because we got there just in time. Don't think he knew whether to thank us or hate us for that. Okay. Okay, fuck me. When? Now. When? Now. Now? Fuck me. Fuck. Oh, fuck. Fuck me harder. Harder. Fuck! Oh, fuck. Harder! Oh, fuck! Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, fuck yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck! Fuck! Oh, fuck! I'm gonna cum. Oh, God! You okay? We're almost done here. I'm feeling a bit uneasy. Could you please get the car ready? Sure. Okay, okay. Pete, finally. I need to resolve this. Who's Pete? My lawyer. Hi, mate. 10 years old, that's what I thought. Brilliant. Okay. Hang on a sec, mate. Hold on. Slow down. Yup. Veracity of the allegation, sure. Yep, all right. Okay. That is a relief, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. All right, mate. Send my love to Carol and the kids. Thank you for taking the call on the weekend. Ciao. There's no case to enter. What? As Ethan is under 10, he's not able to commit an offense by law, therefore the police have no basis to take the matter further, case closed. That's bullshit. Straight for the horse's mouth. I mean, I'm paraphrasing here, but the police have no cause to determine the veracity of the allegation, it remains an allegation, there will be no investigation. Did he actually say that? You could start with an apology. So you're gonna use some legal loophole to let your son rape other kids? Right, Emily, they're kids. Kids explore, it's developmental. I mean, you're blowing this all out of proportion. The bottom line is, your allegation... My daughter has been sexually abused. And your son did it. No. What we have is a nine year old who didn't know he would be in the same room, and two four year olds who can't even agree on the simplest of detail... Just because Ethan is under 10, it doesn't absolve him of responsibility... You heard her. "I wouldn't be able to look at my son." She didn't say that. You know damn well that's what she meant. It puts her in an impossible position! Em, your pop psychology may help your films, but it doesn't work here, okay? Fuck off! Joel? It's them. What? Have a look, play it. Oh, fuck yeah. Uh... What the fuck? Oh, shit. Shit. Where the fuck did you get this? You just left it lying around, anyone could've found it. Natasha. It's very irresponsible, Emily. Give me my phone. No. We have this now, there's nothing you can do about it. It's blackmail. Blackmail. Why are you doing this? I'm doing this to protect my children against your daughter's lies. You're sick. Her lies. This is sick. Maybe we're the ones who should be calling child protection. Oh my God, that is private. I can't believe you would put that out there. It's nasty, mate, and it really doesn't look that good. Okay, this has nothing to do with what has happened to Natasha. I think we're done here, right? Give me my phone, Emily. No, take that footage down now. Or what? Okay, you know what? Yeah, we enjoy fucking. And we enjoy filming ourselves fucking. And we enjoy watching films of ourselves fucking! Yeah, well, that's not a crime. This actually has nothing to do with what has happened to Natasha. Please, guys, this is too much. Yeah. Emily, give me my phone. - No. - Give it to me. Fuck your phone! That is criminal damage. I feel violated. Oh, do you feel violated? Do you? Do you? You don't even know the meaning of the word. I feel, I know! You think you've got so much insight, winning your stupid awards, leeching off other people's pain. And me, I'm just this poor little housewife whose dreams of being an artist are all dried up. That's what you think, isn't it? I have never said that. You can't see inside my head. Inside here. I have experienced things that you couldn't possibly imagine in your deepest, darkest nightmares. You are the hypocrite. Bek. Who cares? This is about our children. After everything that we've done for you guys, and this is how you repay us? Oh, you're insane. This is insane. This is a beautiful community full of lovely people... You're fucking insane. Who trust each other. Okay? The way you're behaving is not conducive to a community spirit. Yeah? What is this? Is this the Catholic church circa 1950? This community. Nobody makes these kind of allegations in this community, Emily. No, they're slanderous, in fact. Slander, you've lost your mind, mate. You haven't got any proof. Natasha's words are the proof. If you talk to anyone about these allegations, I will sue you. Oh yeah, there it is. Lawyer time. You are a pathetic, little man. Really? Yeah, with your porn addiction, and your sham marriage. And you take it out on your son. You know? No wonder Ethan is fucked up. You two, you're the worst kind of parents. Are you done? No. No, I haven't even started. First thing on Monday morning, I'm gonna call child protection, and I'm gonna give them Natasha's statement, and I'm gonna include all of the names. You vindictive little cunt. Keep your nose out of other people's business. What was that? You need to control your wife, mate. This is a joke, right? No, it's not a joke. No, it's not a joke, no, it's a threat, you mongrel. I'm gonna fuck both of you up with that footage. Get off my property. Name and shame thy... What? You threaten me with child protection? You threaten me? Look at your pool fence! What are you talking about? It's completely illegal, it's a fucking child killer. I mean, look at your block! It's a bushfire hazard. And your creek's a disgrace, your gutters need clearing. You have a legal responsibility to this community. You just don't get it, do you, mate? You have had two fucking years to sort this place out. This community doesn't need pretenders like you. Go and prance around the city where you fucking belong. You're a loony! You're a loony! I'm calling the police! Yes. Oh, you fucking idiot. We're the ones with police protection. You know, this actually could've been a really lovely, caring conversation. You guys could've said, "Oh, I'm so sorry "about what has happened to Natasha. "God, this must be really distressing for you guys. "You know, let's all work together to sort out the kids." But then, instead, we just got denial and threats. And now the legal speak about slander and blackmail. And it's upsetting, you know? It's upsetting, and it's attacking, and it's just nasty. The whole thing. I actually thought you guys were our friends. It's waterproof. Fucking hell. And mine's been recording this travesty for the last hour. So... Yeah. I fucking love you. Yeah. Give me the phone. Give me the God damn phone! Give me the God damn phone! Look at what you've done! You're a bad girl! You're a bad girl! Come on, darling. We're going. Nobody believes me! Nobody believes me!
