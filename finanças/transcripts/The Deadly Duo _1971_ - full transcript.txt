"The Jin regime announces that whoever consorts with Sung empire shall be tortured to death." Patriots who tried to save Prince Kang and restore the Sung regime, have been captured by the Jins and will be executed today. We must save them quickly! Hero Shiu, please take some people by the path. Hero Guo, I and a few others will attack the execution site from the main road. We'll attack them from the front and behind. Yes! Let's go! Jin Attack! Get to Chiugou! Go! Attack them! You must be Wan Tiankuei who dares to kill the Han people for the Jins. You must be Bao Tingtian, the Flying Axe. I've heard of you for some time. Ying Tianshi, you're a treacherous villain! Don't pursue him! I must kill that villain today! Why shouldn't I go after him ? A large troop of Jin soldiers will arrive soon. Let's retreat! Let's move! The Jin soldiers are here. Hurry up! Your Majesty. Arise. Hero Wan, some people stormed the execution area? Yes. You failed to guard them. Your Majesty, of the nine prisoners, they only freed one. And they lost nine more men. They're at a disadvantage. Hero Wan, the Jin has Prince Kang as a hostage. It puts us in an advantageous position. It is a great responsibility to guard him and it falls on you. Don't worry! I'll keep guard over Prince Kang. There'll be no problem! Award Hero Wan 500 taels of gold and 50 horses. Yes. Thank you, Your Majesty! Among the princes of Sung, Prince Kang is the smartest one. The others are slow-witted and can cause no harm. As long as we retain him, we will surely win! Your Majesty! Why don't we just kill him? It is easy to conquer a country, but difficult to govern it. After we devour Sung dynasty, he will be useful to us. You wouldn't know about this! Yes. You can lie down and speak. There were so many of you, how come all of you were wiped out? All have been killed. Nine of us were captured, and escorted to the execution site, I... We will go again. Tell us about the situation in Jin. We went in two groups. I was in the first group. Hero Ting Siu led us and got to the riverside. How come there are no other boats around? Only two rafts? The soldiers must have scared them off! You're so bold?! Brother Ting, I think this person... Must be River Dragon! You really know me! Quickly! Come... Hurry up! Swim here! Let's go! These two hiding in burrow and trunk are a villainous pair. The pair, River Dragon, Fire Demon Lui, and Golden Demon are Man Tiankuei's henchmen. They are the so-called "Five Elements Great Fighters". Golden Demon has been killed by me. But Lui's fire bomb is the most difficult one to deal with. After you met with hero Tseng, did you run into "Five Elements Great Fighters" again? Seven of us escaped to a village and ran into Hero Tseng and his men. We were just about to tell Hero Tseng what happened to us. But Lui and Golden Demon came with their men. Hero Tseng! Brother Gau, just the few of you? Where are all the others? They were all killed! Somebody's here! Could it be...? Retreat! We had been taken to jail and sent over to the execution ground the following day. They were all tortured to death one by one! I never dreamt that... I could escape! They were all killed! That means so many heroes have sacrificed their lives but still don't know where Prince Kang is confined. Not true! Someone has found out where Prince Kang is confined. When we were in prison, a few other heroes were captured there, too One of them was almost tortured to death. He happened to lie next to me. He told me about an unguarded secret passage which can lead us to Prince Kang. Where's this secret passage? I don't know who this hero was. But as he spoke, he used his nail to draw the passage on my back. Please have a look! You will see some bruise marks on my back. Those indicate places where fights took place, where many heroes died. The right path leads to the mountain. Only hunters take it, and it is unguarded. If this is the way to Prince Kang, how come no one is guarding it? That path will only lead to a cliff. There's an abandoned bridge between the two cliffs. That hero said only the one with great lifting skills can cross it. A person with great lifting skills? Yes, he urged me to find the loner thief, Yian Luyan. Other than him, no one else can help! Yian is a burglar and has no contact with us. Besides, nobody knows his whereabouts! I know where he is. He runs an antique shop in Xinlung town. I met him once. I'll go and find him. He was defeated by my teacher a few years ago. Owing to his good lifting skill my master released him. And I was there. Maybe for old times' sake, he will help. We'll go to the cliff and take a look first. And see if we can think of other ways! All right! Bao and his men came to rob the prisoner today. Although they only freed one, we lost quite a number of men. And we also lost Golden Demon! I think they will try again. Brother Wan, they'll just die for nothing! Prince Kang is confined here. How can they save him? Right! There's only one way up here where there's also the Jin troop camp! Even thousands of Sung soldiers won't be able to get through! There is no way they can make it! However, the cliff in the back is neglected. There? Unless it's a bird! If there's someone with great lifting skill... Speaking of people with great lifting skill, it reminds me of one of my old friends. Yian Luyan? Yes. Do you know where he is? Yes, he's in Xinlung Town. We need some help here. It would be great if he were here. Only if he agrees to join us. If he doesn't, he may be used by the enemy. You know what should be done. Yes! I will be back soon. The bridge is disintegrating and in really bad shape. Unless someone is lighter than that stone! Anyone who comes this way... will surely die! These are good. Sir, may I help you? I'm looking for my brother! Wrong place, sir! Your brother is not here. I'm here for my brother! He's in the antique shop in the Xinlung Town called "Ji Gu Zhai". "Ji Gu Zhai" All right! Then your brother must have a name! Sure, he's called Yian Luyan! Sir, something has come up in the shop. Please come again tomorrow. I'm sorry. Oh, sir. How can you mess around with Master Yian's name? That's his name. Why can't I? Sir, it seems you're a novice in the boxer world! Close the door. Yes! Come, follow me...this way. You are...? Master Yian, he claims he is your brother. It's you? Little Bat? Why are you here? Brother, it's nice that you still recognize me! Good! You're a mature man. I'll see how much you've learned from our master! Wang, please tend to the counter. There's no business for you here. Yes, Master! Come! Not bad! You're half as good as our master! And about 70 or 80 percent of mine! You've overpraised me. How is our master? He passed away! Brother, you seem very happy to hear of our master's death! Of course not! Little Bat, now you have me! At least you've got a place to settle down. Stay here first! You may have wealth and rank coming to you! Brother, before our master died, he had a few words for you. What did he say? Master said that he made a mistake taking you as his student! He never guessed that you'd play gangster! That's why he asked me to be here and to keep an eye on you after he died. To not let you consort with gangsters again and go around stealing things. Our master must be confused! When I was here just now, you were talking with your friend. How come he hid himself as soon as he knew that I was here? He must be a villain. Let me have a look at him and forbid him to come here again! Nonsense! Little Bat, it seems like your kung fu is as good as mine. Even better! We are like brothers. Does it matter whose kung fu is better? Of course it does! If yours is better than mine, how can I manage you? You haven't changed at all since you were little. Brother! Who is he? Oh, he is... This is the one who will bring us wealth and rank as I said before. Master Yian, someone wants to see you! He's sneaky! He can't be a good guy! Go away! You are not welcome here! Step aside! Such swift movements! Who are you? I'm the junior brother of the one you are looking for! Oh! It's Hero Bao! Come in and have a seat! Wang San, you were in the boxer world before. Now you are a cashier. Don't you recognize me? Well... Boss Yian, are you still in the stealing business? Not for many years! That's good! There's something which only you can do! You have to come with me! Don't be in such a hurry! How about you settle down first? Then we'll talk about it later! No! I can't! It's urgent! We should talk on the way! We must set off immediately! My dear sir, where are you going? We are going to save lives! Save Prince Kang? Yes! Who's behind the partition? Fire Demon Lui? Boss Yian, you haven't changed at all! You are still messing with the Jins! Hero Bao... Don't shoot the fire bomb! I can deal with him. Hero Bao, catch! The antiques here cost thousands of dollars! Don't shoot the fire bomb! If we catch Bao, we will get a much bigger reward! Who are you? I've told you that I'm the junior brother of Yian Luyan! But I don't get it! Before my master died, he told me to keep a check on my senior brother. If he does evil things again, my master asked me to finish him. You know he's conspiring with the Jins? I heard all of your conversation in the room! Then you know we are going to rescue Prince Kang? If you want to rescue Prince Kang, this will be useful. "Gold Medallion of Jin" We know there's a secret passage, but only the person with great lifting skill can cross it! That's why I am here to look for your brother! Now he's dead! There's one whose lifting skill is better than his. Who? Me! According to the map, the bridge is supposed to be ahead of us! The map is correct! This is the bridge! The hero who drew the map said the bridge is decayed and we can't cross it! Let me try! If it can support one man's weight, we can cross it separately! Be careful, Ma! Take lighter steps! How is it going? Fine! Hero Shiu, don't try it! Hero Ma, he is... The hero who drew the map is right! Only one who has great lifting skills can cross it! Brother Gau, of the five of us, my lifting skill is not bad. Let me try! Hero Chang, Hero Bao is on the way for Yian. Why don't we wait until Yian is here? If we need to rely on a villain like Yian to save Prince Kang, we should be ashamed! But Hero Ma just...... He was walking too slow! You have to hold your breath and walk fast. Hero Chang, be careful! I know! My turn now! Hero Shiu! Both of you are renowned swordsmen, but the lifting skill is not your specialty! Hero Shiu, it isn't your specialty either! That's true, but you look! The decayed part of the bridge has already fallen. Maybe I can succeed with some luck. Hero Shiu, don't risk it! The bridge cannot support three people's weight. You can't come out on it! Remember! If anything happens to me, you can't try crossing it again! If Hero Bao can't bring Yian here, you must tell him not to try crossing it! So what you're saying is someone tried to come from the back cliff this morning! Yes! I heard someone shouting and I noticed there was movement. At least two men fell from the bridge. Let them come! It'd be less trouble for us than if they attacked from the main road. But we still should be careful! You continue to monitor there. I will command the villainous pair to guard there. Even if someone gets across the bridge, they can't escape our ambush. Well, is our guest all right? Yes, he has been reading all day! The prince sent him something and he gladly accepted it! Guard him well! Yes! Go down the hill and get the villainous pair to see me. Yes! Someone attempted to get through there last night! Though they failed, we'd better be careful! Yes! You wait here! If anyone comes, he'll walk right into a trap. Yes! You're back! Where are Hero Chang, Hero Shiu, and Hero Ma? What's the matter? Unfortunately, they're dead! Isn't this the road unguarded by the enemy? They didn't die because of the enemy's attack! They died by crossing the decayed bridge! Why didn't you wait for me? Where's Yian? He conspired with the Jins! He and Fire Demon Lui were killed by us! Before Hero Shiu crossed the bridge, he directed us to wait for you here! If Yian comes, we could still attempt to cross the bridge! Otherwise, no need to take the risk! That bridge is impenetrable. What does this mean? We still have to try even if it means death! Brother Bao! You're wrong! We must be alive to do great things! Did they die in vain? If none of you will go, I'll go alone! Who said I'm not going? This is...? Oh...I forgot to introduce you! This is Little Bat! He is the junior brother of Yian! This is Gau Shun. He risked his life trying to save Prince Kang many times! He found this route. Hero Bat! This is Hero Yung Fu, Yung Yi. They are brothers! Brother Bao, if Hero Bat is Yian's junior brother, his lifting skill must be good. His is better than Yian! That's great! We are not cowards! But it is meaningless to die for nothing! In any case we have to wait for you and inform you of the terrain ahead! I think we should go now! Be patient! We can't see clearly in the dark! Besides, you have trudged over a long way! You should rest first! Let's wait till dawn and make sure we're refreshed for the attack! Hero Chang and the other two fell from here! Little Bat, It's your show! What do you think? No one can cross it on top of the bridge! Not even my brother! Prince Kang is kept in captivity at that big house over there! I have to try! You can't do it! If we wait here, Prince Kang will be free? Of course not! We have to figure out how to cross it! But you just said no one can make it! I was saying no one can cross it by walking on top of it! Isn't it the same? Big difference! We can't cross the bridge on the top. But maybe we can cross it underneath! I need a rope. Be careful, Little Bat! Let's go! Retreat! We crossed the bridge, but we also alarmed the Jin soldiers! What should we do? It's difficult to win by attacking the big house from the outside. It'd be easier to attack from the inside! Be serious! We're not even inside yet! How can we attack from the inside? We'll sneak in! Sneak in? Don't think I'm joking! I'm serious! We must sneak in! Brother Bao, how is Wan's kung fu compared to yours? I won't lose if we fight one on one! Great! If we can sneak in, we won't be at a disadvantage! Four of Five Elements Great Fighters under Wan have died! River Dragon may not be inside. Get to the your point! How can we sneak in? With this! "Gold Medallion of Jin" But according to my plan, we need a fearless hero! I am not afraid to die. Not you! We'll need to lean on you! If Hero Bao and you all hadn't rescued me, I would have been executed. It was a lucky escape from death! Brother Gau, you aren't afraid of death! What a great hero! What's your plan? You and your brother go to the river side immediately and prepare a raft for Prince Kang to cross the river. You're confident that you can save Prince Kang? That's what I hope! Let's go. Jins Halt! There's no trespassing on the military site! By the order of Royal Guard Lui, I must see the prince! Who are you? And who is he? The prince has posted a reward for him. He's Bao Tingtian! Show me the way! This is a great merit! Go! Your Majesty, Brother Lui has Bao Tingtian and ordered me to bring him back for a reward first! You can't fool me with this trick! Seize both of them! Brother Lui anticipated that you might not believe! That's why he asked me to bring this gold medal along! Hero Lui must have been killed! How dare you try to fool me with such tricks! Seize them! Yes, sir! Your Majesty, what I've said is true! How dare you catch Hero Bao and ask for a reward! Traitor! I'll kill you! I'm chased by my people on one hand; On the other hand you don't trust me at all! Don't be overjoyed! How do I know he's Bao Tingtian? Of course you wouldn't recognize him! But if I show him to Master Wan, he'll recognize him right away! All right, prepare the horses! Yes! Follow me! Your Majesty! Master Wan, please identify him as Bao Tingtian! Bao Tingtian! Wan Tiankuei! Bao Tingtian, did you think you would end up like this? Master Wan, I'm the junior brother of Yian Luyan. Master Lui caught him and ordered me to bring him to the Jin's camp! Is he really Bao Tingtian? Yes, Your Majesty! Master Wan, this is his axe! Tell them to stop! Stop! Don't kill him! Let him show the way! Where's Prince Kang? Tell me honestly! Show us the way! In there! Little Bat, are you injured? No big deal! Let's go! Where's Prince Kang? Bring Prince Kang out! Quick! Yes, sir! Hero, I admire your bravery and wisdom! But now you are badly injured! If you don't remedy it right away, I'm afraid you'll die. I'm not afraid of death! As long as you surrender, I will let this go! And I'll assign you as the first class royal guard! What do you think? I think... What about it? You can keep daydreaming! Tell them to prepare the horses for us! Prepare the horses! Yes! Let's go! Go! Tell them to step aside! Make way! Let's go! Move and protect the prince! Yes! The prince is here, open the gate! Yes, sir! They've got the prince! Gather the Jin troops and run after them! Yes, sir! Hero Bao! Hero...your wound! You can't sustain this for long! As long as I've got you, I can endure it! It's not too late for you to change your mind! It's not too late for me to kill you, either! Brother Bao, take Prince Kang and go immediately! I'll stop the troops! Little Bat, then you will die! Everyone dies eventually! Go! Now! Come on! Go! Attack! Little Bat, come quickly! Leave! He's already dead! If Sung dynasty had more heroes like him, we could never conquer the Sung! Little Bat!
