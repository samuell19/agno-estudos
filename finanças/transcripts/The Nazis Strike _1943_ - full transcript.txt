In the last 75 years, this magnum has cost the World... ..more than 20 million killed, more than 60 million Wounded... ..more than 200 million made homeless. this does not include the untold millions that died of disease... ..resulting from War. Or the billions upon billions of dollars Worth of property destroyed. Nor does this include the grief... ..the anguish... ..the misery......the terror that the World has sufered. Due to the German's insane passion to enforce their rule upon their neighbors. this passion for conquest, reached its histerical climax... ..When Adolf Hitler enthroned himself as God and the German F?hrer What fantastic dreams Was this humorless man dreaming ..as he stood at N?rnberg and looked doWn on his fanatic folloWers. In the MiddleAges, a plague of slavery descended on the World. Out of the Wilds of Mongolia, came a mighty army of fierce horsemen... ..Ied by Djengis Khan. Burning, looting, pillaging. the Barbarian horde sWept across Asia and Eastern Europe. Djengis Khan conquered most of the World of the 13th century Adolf Hitler Was determined to outdo him... ..and conquer all of the World of the 20th.

It is made up of only two elements labor and raW materials. It is made up of only two elements labor and raW materials. the geo-politicians job Was to transform Hitler's ambition to control... ..these elements into cold hard reality. On their map, our planet is neatly divided into land and Water. Water forms 3/4 of the earth's surface, land only 1/4. And in that 1/4 of the earth's surface, lies the World's Wealth. All its natural resources. And the World's manpoWer. Control the land and you control the World. that Was Hitler's theory. this all important land, the geo- politicians noW break up into two areas. One the Western hemisphere, Which together With Australia and all the.... ..islands of the World including Japan, comprises 1/3 of the land area. the other area, Which consists of Europe, Asia and Africa... ..makes up the other 2/3. this Super Continent Which they call the World lsland.... ..is not only twice as large as the rest of the World.... ..but also includes 7/8 of the World's population. the heart of his World lsland, comprises eastern Europe and most ofAsia. this they call the Heart Land. Which just about coincides With the old Empire of Djengis Khan. Hitler's step by step plan for World conquest can be summarized this Way Conquer eastern Europe... ..and you dominate the Heart Land. Conquer the Heart Land... ..and you dominate the World lsland. Conquer the World lsland... ..and you dominate the World. that Was the dream in Hitler's mind, as he stood at N?rnberg. With page and pageantry the district leaders from all over Germany.... ..sWore personal allegiance to him, hypnotized by the belief..... ..that they Were members of a master race. this film Will deal With act one of the Nazi bid for World poWer. the most fantastic play in all recorded history. Hitler had seen Hirohito grab off Manchuria and other... ..territories from the Chinese. He had Watched Mussolini get aWay With the rape of Ethiopians. He had seen the democratic World look the other Way, While... ..these illegal aggressions Were going on. And he smiled. For collective acts of peace, the only Weapon he had to fear... ..had broken doWn. It Was time noW for the Nazis to start crossing borders. It Was time for Hitler to put his plan into action. And What Was he Waiting for?. He Was Waiting to soften up his victims, keep them from uniting.

But, inside Germany it Was a different story. Here, in up-most secrecy, the hardening up process. Building up Hitler'sArmy and his industry tell the World We have no raW materials... ..and never let them see What goes on. Day after day, night after night, month after month, year after year. We must have the World's most poWerful club. Forget hours, forget hoW to think. Forge the club of blood and iron. And let the Democracies talk about freedom. No freedom here. No labor unions. No overtime. the F?hrer tells you Where to Work. When to Work. HoW long to Work. HoW much your Work is Worth. Forge the club of blood and iron. We have a sacred mission. today We rule Germany... ..tomorroW the World. For those Who don't like it you don't eat. Or you disappear into a concentration camp. Or you get this. And this is the man Who gives it to you. And What of the Army?. Before Hitler came into poWer, the German Army, by treaty... ..Was limited to 100 thousand men. But treaties to the Germans, have alWays been something to ignore. these 100 thousand men Were, in reality, 100 thousand... ..highly trained officers. the men Who lead the Nazi regiments today. But Hitler didn't merely ignore the treaty, he tore it up. And in 1935, ordered National Conscription. Simultaneously, he ordered German youth to become air-minded. toy gliders filled the air. As the youth greW bigger, so did the gliders. Soon these same youths Were trained pilots, flying neW planes... ..the factories Were producing. the Luftwaffe Was being assembled. the only thing old about this neW army Was the goosestep. And even Hitler couldn't improve on that ancient form of German torture... ..designed to make man stop thinking and blindly obey Goosestep them until they become an insensible as Weapons. Everything else Was neW. tanks, motorized equipment and one of our oWn inventions. the dive bomber. All this rearmament Was strictly illegal to the Versailles treaty. And the next illegal step Hitler took... ..Was to march his troops into the Rhineland. A strip of land between Germany and France, demilitarized... ..after the last War as a precaution against future German aggression. But Hitler's plan of eastern conquest, demanded a barrier against... ..democratic action in the West. So Hitler demilitarized the Rhineland and began building the... ..formidable Siegfried Line. A chain of forts and defenses 450 miles long and in some places... ..30 miles Wide. Germany had fought one, two-front War and didn't Want another As many as 1/2 a million men Worked at least 20 hours a day... ..to build 22 thousand fortified positions on land... ..Where, by treaty, no German soldier Was suppose to set foot. Hitler had his Siegfried Line, he had his equipment... ..he had his army. NoW to unveil the German might, and terrorize his intended victims... ..into submission. General staffs all over the World, anxiously aWaited the report... ..of their military attaches. A Would-be peaceful World learned that a vast military poWer had... ..materialized out of noWhere. A poWer controlled by one man, Who tore up treaties... ..as We tear up tickertape. I am Willing to sign anything. I Will do anything to facilitate... ..the success of my policy. Hitler lntervieW October, 1933 Satisfied that they had created the right sense of fear in the World... ..the Nazis got ready to strike, the hour had come. It Was time to start conquering eastern Europe... ..according to the plan of Hitler's geo-politicians. It Was time to Win the domination of the Heart Land. Who Was the first victim to be?. Naturally, the softest, Austria. Bite off just enough... ..not to set the World against you. On March the 12th, 1938, Without Warning, ..the German armies marched over the Austrian border. It Was merely only a full-scale invasion test and Hitler rode in triumph... ..into Vienna. Even the very name of Austria disappeared from the map... ..though Hitler had promised earlier to the World: the assertion that it is the intention of the German Reich to coerce... ..theAustrian State is absurd Adolph Hitler, January 30, 1934 Why Was Austria important to Hitler?. It put him on the southern flank of Czechoslovakia... ..and Czechoslovakia Was the key to the control of eastern Europe. the German Chancellor Bismarck explained that years ago When he said... ..He Who Would conquer Europe, must first toll the bastions of Bohemia. And Bohemia Was noW part of Czechoslovakia. But Czechoslovakia Was tough. It had a good army. It had good equipment. It had one of the finest ammunition plants in the World... ..the Skoda Works, Which Hitler Wanted very badly. It had incorrupt able President Benes. It had a military alliance With France and France had a military... ..alliance With Britain. Find excuses to take Czechoslovakia one piece at a time. He found his excuse in the Sudetenland. the portion of Czechoslovakia bordering Germany. Here lived some people of German origin, although they had never been... ..a part of Germany itself. that Was Hitler's cue. Completely ignoring the fact that most people Who left Germany.. ..had done so to get aWay from things like Hitler. He sprang his pet theory, that every person of German blood... ..no matter Where he lives, belongs to the Nazi Reich. Germans or descendants of Germans. Often With no more than a drop... ..of German blood in their veins, suddenly learned they Were God-like. Not subject to the land in Which they live or... ..to Which they oWe their allegiance... ..Whether it be Czechoslovakia.... Norway. SWeden. China. the United States ortimbuktu. According to the Nazis the German Was a special creature Who Would remain... ..forever German of the 6th and 7th generation and must take his... ..orders from Berlin.

And When the Czechs Were beaten up trying to combat his 5th Columnists... ..Hitler screamed the Germans Were being persecuted and threatened... ..War, unless he got the Sudetenland. It is the last territorial claim I have to make in Europe. I have assured Mr. Chamberlain, and I repeat it here... ..that When this problem is solved, there is for Germany no further... ..territorial problem in Europe.

On September 29, in return for Hitler's guarantee of World peace... ..Chamberlain and Daladier prevailed upon Czechoslovakia to give up.... ..the Sudetenland Without a fight. In Czechoslovakia the Munich Pact Was greeted by riots of protest. But Daladier returned to France to be greeted by cheers... ..from a relieved French people. And in Britain, a happy Chamberlain came back declaring he had... ..achieved peace, peace in our time. One of the most tragic and ironic scenes in all history. this morning, I had another talk... ..With the German Chancellor Herr Hitler, and here is the paper... ..Which bears his name upon it as Well as mine. the agreement Was signed last night... ..and theAnglo-German Naval Agreement as symbolic... ..of the desire of our two peoples never to go to War With one another again.

Without these fortified cautions, Czechoslovakia Was disarmed. A ripe plum ready to fall into Hitler's lap. Within 6 months of declaring that he Wanted no more territory anyWhere.

It Was too fantastic to make any sense....it didn't. the Germans hoped they could lull Russia into a false sense of security.
