The first Europeans to arrive in Brazil, in the year 1500, the Portuguese brought blacks from Africa to work as slaves in sugarcane plantations, the colony's main wealth. Absolute masters of the life and death of their slaves, white slave owners made them work without rest, at the expense of often fatal punishments and tortures. Some slaves, however, managing to escape hid in the virgin interior of the country, where they formed free communities called Quilombos. Of these, the most famous was the Quilombo dos Palmares, founded in the late 16th century, in the mountains of northeastern Brazil. In Brazil A black Eldorado grew In Brazil When freedom's sun flashed through There glowed A light divine, Olorun's fiery sun It showed Utopia, one for all and all for one Quilombo All built white saints dispelled all fears Quilombo Washed in the water of so many tears Quilombo Built of love and toil untiring Quilombo Even now our hearts inspiring In Brazil A black Eldorado grew 1650 - A Sugar mill, Pernambuco, during the Luso-Dutch War. You can turn it till blood comes out of his mouth, by tightening the ring for the digestive system. Thus the slave will receive due punishment, without danger to his life or his ability... to work, and so protects... his master's property. What happened? Is he dead? He couldn't do that to me! Miss Olimpia... Your husband says a Dutch officer has arrived... So you should clean up the house. Dutchmen in Santa Rita? In my house? André! - Where are you going? - Your mother's calling! I want to see these Dutchmen. Come on! André! Go after him, Gongoba! André! You're crazy! He was killing Aroroba. I wasn't going to let him beat him to death. You're new around here. You've just arrived in Santa Rita... You don't know how much you'll suffer for what you did. We could... run away. Run where? I want to die. I'd rather die... I'm going to... No... not die... Somebody's coming! If we got together... I need more slaves here in Santa Rita. If you'd sell me your prisoners... I can't. They're the Governor's. Dandara! Liquor! How many men did you take up the mountains? - 200? 300? - More or less. But Captain... what an amazing failure! Father! There should be some niggers here. Dandara! Call the foremen, quick! They can't do this to me. Dandara, my sword! The news will get out soon. We have to get away quick. Where to? To the sea... back to our home. I was born here. This is my home. Africa's too far away. Right. We came from Palmares and we'll go back there. You can come with us if you'd like. Palmares! The land of free men. Where black men run, who don't want to be slaves. We have to go to Palmares. I'm going home, across the sea. I'll cross the sea. If you want, come with me! Aroroba... I think I'll go with them. Ibuku ale si alafia ni. Talk white man's language so we can understand. He wished us a night full of blessings. Stop it! Stop it! Enough! One must stay alive! To tell the others what he saw here. Gongoba! Come on! Pharaoh let Moses leave with his people... in search of the Promised Land. As soon as Moses had left, Pharaoh regretted it, and sent his army after the Jews into the desert. When the Jews arrived at the Red Sea, God divided the waters... and the Jews passed over on dry land. But when the Egyptians tried to follow them, God sent the waters back and they were all drowned... Come on... inside! I'm unarmed. We need help. We, who? - We need food and shelter. - And salt. To take with us. My wife will get you something to eat... and salt to take with you. We don't have much, but enough to share. The drums of Palmares... Why don't you go to Palmares Must be better than staying here alone. I'm not alone. Anyway, this is my piece of land. I mean... it's not mine, but no one would want so little. If the owner turns up, I'll have to look for another piece of land. Brazil is very big. You can stay here forever. You needn't move your family. You give what Palmares hasn't got. So Palmares will give you what you need. With Palmares beside you, no landowner will throw you out. Acotirene may not like it. Acotirene? Acotirene controls Palmares. So we'll take him to talk to Acotirene. Take a white man to Palmares? Acotirene won't like it. It's a boy... The child opens its eyes to the Earth Father of Heaven Look at this child Protect this child Father Bless him every day It's Terencio. Acotirene's sent for us. Palmares... Palmares! Acotirene was expecting you. How did Acotirene know I was coming? Why did you bring a foreigner to Palmares? We are also foreigners here. A land where everybody is foreign. Many people live in the valley like me. They can help... if you help them. When the war is over... they'll try to destroy Palmares. We must take advantage of this war to grow... and make Palmares stronger. So they will prefer to make peace with us. Palmares must grow. So we don't even have to negotiate with them. Beware the enemy's smile. When you see the enemy's face up close, the heart softens, and your blow will not be so hard. Acotirene knows the ancient truths, and leads the people of Palmares with kindness. But Acotirene fears the new truths... and this is not good for Palmares. Xango is his creator who hovers over him... That is the way of the young. Xango speaks... You are the chosen one. You are Ganga Zumba. No, Acotirene... I'm just Abiola... son of the King of the Arda. I come from a far-off land. Ganga Zumba... I was lion hunting near my village when they caught me. They sold me to the white men as a slave. That's how I came here... to my new land. Ganga Zumba... It's time to go back to the forest. Acotirene will return to the forest. But he leaves the new blood Palmares needs. Acotirene leaves Ganga Zumba. The Gods sent you through Xango... to govern Palmares in this new era. I'm frightened. Am I able to? Don't go, Acotirene. Stay, mother, stay... Hear your people... Think again, Acotirene. Acotirene! Xango, my father! Five years later Hail, Oh Earth, Great God, Great Earth. All give thee honor... ...roast the beans until you get a coarse powder. Then infuse them. It's very good for fevers, To give energy when your chest is weak you must do this... My dear little grandson... give Granny a kiss. To give energy when your chest is weak, take houseleek juice, and drink it with honey. If you hurt yourself in the forest, take a castor-oil plant... crush it well, and apply it to the wound. The wound will heal. If we catch one of them alive, at least we won't return to Bahia penniless. We're at the mountains, near Palmares. So? Are you scared? There are only kids there. But the adults won't be far away. We finished off the Dutch army. We can't be scared of a bunch of niggers. "Ia"... Mother! "Oba"... King! - And what's "food"? - "Onje"! Just keep very quiet. Don't try anything. Let's go! You're all under arrest! Come on! Pepper! Go on! - Me? - Yes. Damn... I've got to take one. No... No! My son! Get out of my way, dammit! You sure he has no master? Examine him. You'll see he has no brand of ownership. How much do you want? Your blessing, Father. God bless you. Tell me something. Who gives the orders here? Why? The Governor of Pernambuco State... sent us to exterminate the negroes of Palmares. It will be hard. Father, announce we need... food and men, a lot of men to go up into the mountains. Those who come will be granted land in the mountains. And plenty of slaves to work there. Thanks, but I know that one... Ring the bells, Father. Tell the village that all who present themselves... will have their crimes forgiven, and vagrants will avoid being arrested. You give me the money for the boy later, Father. Strange... very strange. Where's this guide taking us? Is it here? No, not yet. The men must be hungry. There's food farther on. Pineapple! Hey, come here! Run! This war of yours doesn't concern me. I'm from Bahia. What's this? Kawo kabiesile! Ee! Who's that? That's Ganga Zumba. Everybody's heard about him. "Saure", my Ganga Zumba! Spy! Traitor! They've killed Gongoba, but I want my godson in my arms again. Palmares will grow and wait for him, for he will return. He will be the sun for us.

"Et cum spiritu teo..." Francisco... With the plague here, better stay in at night. Francisco... Can't you hear me? You're too far away. They were crossing the mountains... and they asked to see Ganga Zumba. Where are they going? To the other side to find the Land-without-Evil. Where's that? No one knows. I'll just keep on walking... until a sign appears that we're there. Maybe this is the sign, brother... There are plenty of niggers for us to catch! Everyday! Let's go! Get on with it! Keep carrying! No slacking! There are runaways there... Plenty of runaways... Runaways there... Didn't I tell you not to eat? What did I say? Come on! No slacking there! There are runaways there... Runaways there... Dance, Namba, dance... Who are you? I'm tired. Very tired. You came up all this way? It's safer. But no one's done it before. Ganga Zumba... Want to talk to him? I can take you to him. Hes my friend. Ganga Zumba... Namba... It's him. I'm certain. It's him, Namba. He's come back! Acaiuba! He's back! I can't believe it's you! Come, Acotirene, lady of the secret Priestess that calls Ganga Zumba Offers you the throne of plenty All beauty and the throne of the amulets Springs and more springs Pots and more pots Heaven on earth is Aruanda Thus is Palmares Palms in the air Sing and dance and open the ring Let go my corn, woman! That corn's mine! Whoever needs it, takes it. They took it from my piece of land! I never heard anyone say, "My piece of wind". Or "My piece of cloud". What is the world's is the world's. Since the land is nobody's, whatever it produces belongs to everyone. We could play with our feet. I heard you were here. Dandara! Dandara! I saw you being born... Like some tea? It's really Chinese. Who's this? Captain Fernão Carrilho at your service. Like some tea? - What does he want? - To speak to Ganga Zumba. Speak. I don't think you're Ganga Zumba. - Same thing. - No, it isn't. I want to speak to the king. I have a proposal to make. To Ganga Zumba. Tell him... Tell him how behaved with you... Captain Carrilho could have destroyed the village... and advanced on your capital. He could have destroyed all of Palmares... with his military strength! But I prefer peace... with Ganga Zumba. The mill owners pay me to wage war on Palmares. But I prefer peace. What do you get out of it? A small part of the silver and gold stolen from the mills, from travelers and churches. None of it is any use to you here. Do you accept? No. As I understand it... the mill owners pay you to wage war... and we pay you not to. Right? Peace is priceless! So I reckon I should receive twice for such good deeds. - Good, but risky. - Which increases the value. We give you gold. What do you give us? - Peace! - Arms. Leave some weapons here. And ammunition. You could tell your bosses you lost some arms in the war. Fine. Let's start with this... They want to stay. - Stay where? - In Palmares! What are you going to do in Palmares? I learnt how to make bread with the Dutch. You take sugar, milk, almonds, barley flour... and mix and mix. "Oh Muse, speak of the wise man..." "Who after he had destroyed the city of Troy..." "Wandered through many a place..." "And knew their peoples..." "And their customs..." That's Homer in the original. I know a little Greek. Rui, now it's your turn. What you know is of no use. We can do what we are taught, No! Not you! I want to stay too. Look at your hands. They are so delicate. What can you do in Palmares? If you don't let us stay, it's because you're the same as they are. She's mine! Ana belongs to me! He saved her life when we drove back the Dutch. The people in Recife tried to lynch the heretics friends. She was contracted by the Dutch... to liven up their nights in Recife. So she should serve whoever she owes her life to. What about the war, Captain? Excuse me while I order my men to start the war. War? Tomorrow the mill owners... must see signs of a war on the mountains. Captain... We need something else as well as the weapons. No! So we managed to destroy 3 cities of Palmares... with only 4 insignificant losses. And we finished off about 2.000 negro rebels. 3.000. Thanks to our brave Captain who in one battle alone... beheaded 200 blacks is one go! No need to exaggerate, 150's fine. The mill owners! Cover all this... and wait for me here. I'll see to them. You come with me! It's him... Well, well... what a nice surprise! I wasn't expecting a welcome. I am pleased to announce that our mission was successful. We have exterminated all subversion in Palmares. We lost a servant, 3 men and some arms. But we know we have done our duty. Tell them... Go on! Where are the prisoners? Prisoners? Let's go up the mountain. Before paying you what we owe, Captain... we should like to see the ruins of Palmares. Captain Carrilho! Acaiuba! Run! Run! Run, you devil! Get then both live! Where's Ana, you dog? You know these niggers well, don't you? I'm a specialist in their tactics. No, not like that. That one you killed, for example... He spoke to you like a friend. Like a friend? So I'm a friend of niggers? Captain Carrilho... You're under arrest! He goes on to a new life We bid our farewells The great hunter comes to fetch him We bid him farewell on his way to a new life Leave him alone. Acaiuba... They killed the bravest. The purest. The best of our brothers. Will no one pay for this? I should pay. Ganga Zumba... My time has come. Let me avenge Acaiuba. Give me permission... to fight for him. "Ogun Ogunhe!" "Ogun protect thy son, and teach him the secrets of war." "Look after him every day." "Protect this body of his." "When he goes to war..." "Bless thy son." "Not to fear." Ogun Ogunhe! Send thy greatest warriors... from the vale of death to protect thy son. Teach thy son the wisdom of war! You are no longer nobody. You are your people! You are born again, and your Father Ogun bids you be called Zumbi Alakijade, to whom the colors of war were given. You are Zumbi, who never dies! Zumbi... "Saure!" Zumbi dos Palmares! "Saure!" "Saure!" Zumbi dos Palmares! Zumbi, warrior and commander Ogun-ie, chief blacksmith Overlord of my being Send freedom Into my heart I'm free! Thank you, good Jesus! Thank you, Zumbi of Palmares! My sword showers the sun of war Hacks forest, sweeps heaven, through Earth tore Black delight that warriors crave Maracatu Maculele, and young men brave My sword spreads the sun of fighting My quilombo all the mountains lighting Like fans, and the dancing Of the samba leader the twists and turns of "capoeira" You needn't be afraid. But what you're been spreading is only fear. "Et clamor meus..." "ad te veniat". "Dominus vobiscum". "Et cum spiritu tue." Francisco... That's not my name, Father. I am Zumbi of Palmares. I came to give you this back. Thank you... I didn't eat the basket of food. There was something else you forgot... No, I didn't forget. It just wasn't any use to me. Unless I took it from the other end. Black delights that warriors crave Brazil, my own Brazil My great sanctuary My cradle and nation Zumbi, protector, guard and patron Send freedom Into my breast Dandara! Recife, Dandara! Take Recife, Zumbi. You're reached it. Now it's easy to go in. If I enter their capital... even as a conqueror, I will have to do what they do. If we take Recife, Dandara... we'll end up with slaves, like them. I called you... because I have received a letter from the Governador... on behalf of the King of Portugal, asking me to go to Recife to discuss peace. There it is. Ana read it for me. That's treachery! On whose part? Peace. Zumbi is concerned with victory in war. We need some time without war. To grow... so Palmares becomes invincible. I'll go to Recife. I'll see what they want from us. "Ganga Zumba undertakes to leave the mountains... with all his people, and settle to the north, in the Cucaú valley, which is granted to him by the Portuguese Crown. Those who accompany him, and all those born there, will be considered free men, subjects of the King of Portugal. But the inhabitants of Cucaú will undertake... not to accept runaway slaves from city or mill... and will return them to their rightful owners." Ameri... what? America. America... America... "No free inhabitant of Cucaú... is allowed to leave the valley for any reason, under penalty of arrest and return to captivity. So? What's there is what was agreed? So... we are agreed? Don't accept, Ganga Zumba. If you give way now, you'll always give way. Why not give way? Knowing when is a feature of great kings! Tell me something... don't I know you from somewhere? You mean... from some brothel in Recife? Ganga Zumba thinks you could be a friend of slaves... We are not slaves and will never be again! Cucaú is not ours. It's being given, so can be taken back. We must stay here in the mountains! I'm staying here! If we stay here... this war will never end. One day the whites will come... and destroy Palmares. Everyone here from the villages... knows the whites... are very strong... because they have already seen... their attacks before now. Even so, Palmares is still here! Palmares is still here! The time hadn't come. The time hadn't come. The whites have more men and more arms. Time only increases their power. They were nice to us in Recife. We must be patient, and have time to grow, and make peace so we can be free, and never, never be slaves again! He who becomes a slave again is afraid of dying. I fetched Acaiuba's remains... so Ganga Zumba may remember who kills... and who dies. This is what happens... when you become friends with the enemy. How can we be friends of the white man? If their happiness depends on our enslavement? Zumbi is right! Zumbi is wrong! They promised us... that if we went to Cucaú... the war would stop, and the King of Portugal... would give us freedom forever. The King cannot give me what is mine! The King cannot give me what is mine! Ganga Zumba' right! Zumbi, you are leading your people to disaster! Each one will choose. Ibualama from Andalaquituxe! The people of Andalaquituxe love Ganga Zumba, but won't leave Palmares. Tite from Dambranga! In Dambranga Ganga Zumba will always be king, but we want to stay. Lua from Subupira! In our village, Subupira, no one will go to Cucaú. Teodoro from Cerca das Tabocas! We of Cerca das Tabocas... feel that the war must end in victory for Palmares! Katambo from Amaro! Ganga Zumba's heart has softened with time. Ganga Zumba's head is weak. Katambo! We from Amaro think that Zumbi is right. Zumbi is right. I gave my word to the Governor. Zumbi's right, Ganga Zumba. But I'll go with you to Cucaú. Is it Cucaú, Ganga Zumba? It's Cucaú! All pots break, all beads scatter All graces shatter Ganga Zumba climbs down the mountain tall Deep inside a taste of gall to quell his anger... Zumbi's stayed in the mountain with his people. He has not fulfilled the agreement. Ganga Zumba's not responsible for Zumbi. The Recife agreement talks of the blacks. As for the white people, they must prove they owe nothing to Portuguese law. The white people and indians are our brothers. They are the same. We won't fight over trifles. We are friends now, right? You'd better convince Zumbi to come, because if he doesn't... there can be no peace. Ah, I was forgetting... On behalf of the Governor of Pernambuco State... welcome to Cucaú... friends! The Captain's closed the valley. As if we were his prisoners. That's what we are. It's Zumbi's fault. If he'd come... We must send someone to talk to him. He won't come. I know. We have to leave here, and now. But for that, we need him. Leave here? What is Ganga Zumba going to say... to those who followed him here? No. We stay here. And we'll force Zumbi to come. We are the white man's friends now. They are our friends. Xango no longer hovers over Ganga Zumba's head. Xango has left me... Salé will betray us. Salé is right. I made them come here. Now the people are divided, and it is my fault. Only Ganga Zumba can change things. I know! I know! Tomorrow... Tomorrow night I shall need your help, Ana. I got your message. What do you want? Why the sword, Captain? You don't need it here. You never know. We've already met once when, without a sword, things would have been different. In Recife? No. Long before. My name is André Tourinho. I was the youngest of the man from Santa Rita. So, what do you want from me? The boy... Aroroba saved your life once. I don't know if I can again. I don't know if I can save yours, Ganga Zumba. Don't you realize your life is in my hands? And that it is worth nothing now? I know... That I know... "Emu..." Palm wine. The rest of what we brought from Palmares. Namba, call the people. - What for? - What for? Go, Namba! Call Salé and the people... quickly! "Emu..." From the mountains... From Palmares! Ganga Zumba's dying! Ganga Zumba's been poisoned! He's poisoned Ganga Zumba! Not me... Salé, my brother... Do you see? They are not our friends... Take the people back, Salé. Take them back to Palmares. Ganga Zumba's dying! He's dying! The whites are surrounding the valley, but if you take them by surprise, perhaps some of ours will die, but most will get through. Quick, break through the circle. He did it himself, didn't he? The people of Palmares are no longer divided. The people of Palmares are united again! Go away! Go away! Let's go! Ganga Zumba has ordered it! Let's go back to the mountains! "Saure", Ana de Ferro! Namba lie down for Ganga Look into each other's eyes Namba lie down for Ganga Kiss the mouth Namba lie down for Ganga Legs in the air Iaia Namba is Ganga's Beautiful home Ganga's woman Namba... woman... home... Ganga's Namba... woman... home... 11 years later Zumbi said... "You only become a slave if you're afraid of dying". Zumbi is stronger than everything. With him, Palmares will last forever. Domingos Jorge Velho? My name is Bernardo Vieira de Mello. The Governor asked me to greet you. Domingos Jorge Velho has come from São Paulo, contracted by the Governor on behalf of the King. They want to put an end to Palmares. He is in Pernambuco State... waiting for the army promised by the Portuguese. The King has decreed that Palmares and Zumbi... are the greatest shame for the Colony, and has authorized men... and resources to be brought... from wherever necessary. They will wipe you out, whatever the cost. Is that why you're leaving? I can't come here anymore. They are arresting and sending to Lisbon... any white man who negotiates with Palmares. Even landowners under suspicion lose their land. You won't miss... the information I've been giving you. Everyone knows that Zumbi... has a circle of spies among the slaves... in the mills and towns. I'm going to disappear... and go to the south. They say there's gold in Minas Gerais. You needn't run away. No one will conquer Palmares. The Portuguese will give Domingos Jorge Velho... the largest and strongest army ever seen in Brazil. - Canons... - Canons? Six barrels. How did you know? What use are canons against Palmares? We leave the villages... hide in the forest, and attack by surprise... His army could destroy all the forest! He could destroy everything! If he asked for canon... that's because he intends to destroy our capital first. He knows he doesn't need so much for the villages. So we must get Zumbi out of here quickly. No. If you are our friend... do us one favor before you leave. Spread around we are going to stay here and wait. I don't think you'd... Take him back to the valley. Katambo... Lua. Get all the people into the capital. From now on everyone is a warrior. All must be trained. Even the women and children. The only ones to stay in the villages... are these who defend the plantations. Let's get ourselves ready. We're going to stay here waiting for him? No, Teodoro. Not you. You take our best warriors to Boqueirão da Serra... and hide there, and wait for the order to attack from the rear... when they are attacking the town. But how can we resist the canon? We will. It's good they are bringing so much armament. Their defeat will be so much the greater. No white soldier will be brave enough to come here again. One day we have to fight the last battle in this war. Zumbi hasn't asked the people if they went this. I can't force them to be like me. But I can make them do what's best for them. Unwilling people lose their imagination. People without imagination are no use at all. Not even in war. I am the king. A king must act, or he is not king. Ganga Zumba was king too. Teodoro! Take the warriors away! Wait for the order. Katambo will stirrup the people. Zumbi must take him prisoner, before he betrays... I know. Let's prepare the city to face Domingos Jorge Velho! January 1694 My God! Dandara... Pray, Dandara... Pray for us... My sword spreads the sun of fighting My Quilombo all the mountains lighting Like fans and the dancing of the samba leader The twists and turns of "capoeira". As canons explode and firearms rattle In each respite in the endless battle I'll sing... I'll sing and sing and sing. Black joy is the joy that warriors bring... Looks deserted... But it isn't. - What's this? - Let's advance. No, it's dangerous. We don't know... Fire, then. - It's too far. - Fire! Look what I've brought you, Zumbi of Palmares! Fire! Six barrels! Come on, Domingos Jorge Velho! I'm waiting! The shots aren't reaching the wall! Let's advance! Advance! Advance! Let's advance! Let's go! Forward! Halt! Wait a moment. Let's go on! If we go on, we'll fall into other traps. Those who reach the walls will be massacred. You must retreat! You must save our men! We must save our canon! We've already lost 2! Zumbi was prepared. Someone warned him we had canons. Zumbi...! Zumbi of Palmares! If they advance further, we can finish them off from up on the wall, when they get really close. But they've retreated. They've stopped attacking. They haven't given up. They'll go on trying. That's what Zumbi said. Tomorrow, at daybreak... they'll try again, and we'll go on letting them... until there are only a few left... who'll die of hunger or exhaustion. Then we'll tell Teodoro... to attack and... not one will be left alive. So no will ever have courage to come here again... to attack Palmares. Katambo should be here to see this. You had him imprisoned. Now have him set free. I can't. Katambo is your friend. He's like a brother... But I can't, Dandara. Zumbi, Tité is calling you. Zumbi! Zumbi of Palmares! Look! They are our slaves. One of them must have told you of the canon. It must have been them! Look at your spies, Zumbi! Fire! This Domingos Jorge Velho... He's not like the others. Acotirene, my mother... Did you send for me? Palmares is eternal. Palmares will never end... Never! Acotirene... Acotirene... Who's singing? Aren't you a sleep? What time is it? It's late. Or early. Soon it will be daybreak. What's the use of what you're doing? No use. What's the use of war? The mist protects the town. Until daybreak, our enemies won't even be able to see the walls I can use it... to get the traps remade. I must get some men to do it. Know something? I've always wanted to know why some people like to give orders. I am Zumbi of Palmares. I know. What were you singing? No, no... not like that. The mist... protects the town. But it can also help Domingos Jorge Velho. Has that noise been going on for long? We thought they were taking away the dead. They're here. Quite close. Like people working... building something... If it's what I'm thinking... tomorrow morning the canons will reach the town. What can they be building? A palisade... A fence around the walls. Tomorrow, at daybreak, when the mist rises, they can fire the canons from up close. The fence will protect them. What will we do? Give the alarm. Wake the town up. Go to Boqueirão da Serra... and tell Teodoro to attack. We'll leave the town and attack from the front. If Teodoro arrives in time, from the rear. We'll close in... before they destroy the walls. Will this work? Yes. The canon will reach the walls with this fence. We'll attack at daybreak. As soon as the mist rises. Cold, huh? Reminds me of São Paulo. I'd like to live here. Live here? When this war's over... Domingos Jorge Velho will stay here... on land in Palmares. Or where Palmares was. That's impossible. This land is promised to the mill owners. And to Portuguese nobility. The King can't give land to... to mere... to... Look here, my friend. We came a long way from a very poor land. We are tired of scrabbling through forest... killing niggers and indians just to make you rich. Domingos Jorge Velho is getting old... He needs some land to rest on. Anyway, if he lives here it will be safer for you. Think of that! After the war, you'll be his neighbors! That won't happen. Prepare the canons! But the palisade isn't ready. You can't see anything, anyway. Weren't we waiting for daybreak? The mist is rising. Zumbi know we're here. Zumbi says to attack the palisade! Before they can use the canons! Don't let them use the canons! Fire! Fire! The wall's been hit, Zumbi! They're trying to get in. Tell Tité to set Katambo free. We'll need everybody. Lua, you... look after Dandara. Don't let anyone hurt her. Lets defend the town. Teodoro's on his way. Zumbi of Palmares! Slaughter the niggers! Don't leave one alive! After living in Palmares, none of them will make good slaves! Zumbi of Palmares! Acotirene, Acotirene! Didn't you say Palmares was eternal? Where's your power, Acotirene? Ganga Zumba... My Ganga... We'll never be slaves again. Never. Katambo! Katambo, my brother. The canons are destroying the city. Zumbi must get out of here! No, we'll stay together until the end. Zumbi of Palmares. Teodoro... You arrived, Teodoro. We must get him out of here soon! No use resisting. You have no way out. Surrender. We haven't found his body. - Whose? - Zumbi's. The war is over. Let's go. What about Zumbi? We've destroyed Palmares. We have nothing else to do here. You're wrong. While Zumbi is alive, Palmares will live. Who said he's still alive? Domingos Jorge Velho will stay here. To make sure! Acotirene told me... that Palmares was eternal. That it would never end. Acotirene can't be wrong. Long time since Teodoro left... He went to see... there was any village still resisting, so we could take Zumbi there in safety. He's a long time because there are soldiers everywhere. Must be hard to get through. Lua... Tité... Katambo... All dead? You hungry, Zumbi? I am. If only I could find some fruit. Go over there. There's bananas and breadfruit. Take your spear. You may need it. No. I won't. Teodoro gave me a knife. Where did I put it? It's there. There! What's your name? Mine? Camuanga. "Saure", Camuanga! "Saure", Zumbi dos Palmares! Teodoro... You took a long time. Forgive me... They tortured me. Run, Zumbi... run! I give you back your spear, so it won't fall into enemy hands... "Ogun-ie!" Camuanga became leader of the Palmares resistance until 1704, when he was killed in battle with the Portuguese. Other warriors took his place in battle. The Colonial forces never managed... to exterminate Palmares completely. Resistance in the area was last heard of in 1797, more than a century after the death of Zumbi.
