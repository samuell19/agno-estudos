Hey, boss. Yo, you all right? 20 Golds. All right, this is it. People got a lot of names for someone like me The way I see it, I deal in the lies people tell and the truths they don't. I deal in secrets. I dig them up or I bury them forever. I've been doing that for at least half my life. You see that? Quick on your feet. That's the first principle of greatness. Quick feet had nothing, unless you keep your head still. And you've got to know the exact location of your off stump. Right? - Oi, Are you listening? - Dad. It's what I call your moral compass. Once you know its whereabouts, you can do whatever you please. Yeah, okay. Us immigrants, we've got to be better than the locals. Who are you calling an immigrant? Shot! What was that? King Viv! Where? Let me see, ya bugga. The old man reckons you can learn everything you need to about life from the game of cricket. Not sure how much it helped him when he fled Uganda in '73 with nothing but a bag and his army revolver under his jacket just in case. He was in the uh, King's African Rifles. I think he still got the gun somewhere. Did you see that range? A super shot, beautifully positioned. - What a monster. - Merciless, man. Dad. Yes! Pills. Off the back foot this time. That languid flow of the bat. Glorious stuff. All right? Where are you going? I'm going to work. The last ball of the 50th over and he's finished it off nicely with a six. We've all got our stories, our lies, our secrets. They say the truth will always out. Well, I hope not. I'd be out of a job, for a start. There you go. People call me a snoop. And they call me a lot worse. Your door was open. No worries. Come in, Miss uh... Chase. Melody Chase. How'd you find me, Miss Chase? I've got an app, Mr. Akhtar. Natasha, my flatmate. She's gone missing. - She Russian? - What? Hookers. Orientals are adjectives. Happy, Lucky, Smiley, whatever. Black girls are musical nouns. Harmony, Jazz, Melody. And um...

This is our manor, right? We got to pull it up. - Yeah, one water feature at a time. - Yeah, exactly. About your business partner, Usman Rana... He's dead. What's going on?

You know, I could do with your help. Anything. I need to find out what happened for business, but more importantly for his family. All right? If you could just like, keep me in the loop, man. I'd appreciate it. Of course. You know, it's just like the old days, innit? Churchill Massive, right? I'm not sure if you're allowed to do that once you got a water feature. - See you, man. - See you. You know, listen, You got a fag? Still fucking bumming cigarettes. Some things never change, innit? Ah no, keep it. It's all right. I pretend I don't smoke and she pretends she don't know. Right. The key to a successful marriage, yeah? It really is, don't joke. Take care, man. Hey, um... I...

I'm talking to Mr. Akhtar. Tommy will walk me. Won't you? What can I get you, sir? Hello mate, have you got Wild Turkey? Yes, we do. - Can I get a double, please. No ice. - Yeah, sure.

Right, yeah. Sorry. Um... Another time? Another time. Tomorrow? Yeah. I'm working till midnight. Maybe we could have a nightcap. - Tomorrow's good. - Okay. Okay. You don't talk much. Sorry. No, it's nice. I just want someone to listen. You know? Yeah. You better leave me here. Mum doesn't like seeing me with strange boys. Am I a strange boy? A little bit. I don't give a fuck who you are, it's my crime scene. We'll take it from here, officer. Yeah, well fuck you very much. We've got it. Thanks. - Hello? - You all right, Cal? Tommy. Where are you? Yeah, I'm across the canal. 2-6, CCTV needs a status. The emergency call? God. "It ain't our fault, mum." I should've known. "Will you please pursue, sir?" Funny. What's going on, Tommy? By the time I got here, the room was clean. Clean? Seal it banked. Even the security cams are gone. Spooks got on lockdown. - Wh, wh, what spooks? - SO15. Counter fuckin' terrorism. You shittin' me? You expecting trouble? Always, Mr. Akhtar. Call me Tommy. I'm gonna change. The living room's that way. - Sorry. - It's all right. Those bullets get stuck in my hair. I know the feeling. So... Did you um... find Natasha? No, not yet. I found a client though. - What'd he say? - Not a lot. He's dead. Found him at the Holiday Inn. Pretty messy. I believe the term is "blunt instrument". You don't think that Natasha did it? Fuck. Usman Rana. That name mean anything to you? You sure about that? No, he was just another client. All right. I'm gonna need to have a look at her bedroom. Yeah. Why did she die? I dunno. You were her friend. You tell me. I am her friend. When you do this job, some things... Some things you don't... Yeah. I know what you mean. Pretty girl. Who's that? Her sister, I think. Wouldn't have had you down as the sensitive type. Only when I shave. Can I hang on to this? Yeah. All right. I'll try to have some more for you soon. Okay. Let's see that. - Do you think he fancies her? - What? Well, you know what he's like. I dunno. Maybe. She's... I dunno, mate. It'll be fine. Don't know what I'll do, Tom. Stu, you've got nothing to worry about, mate. Cheers, mate. Come on then, what do you got? Spreadsheets innit, bruv. Yeah accounts. Yeah, it's Rana's company. Why's he got them on the phone, blud? I mean just one file. That's weird, fam. Unless he's got something to hide. Yeah, look at this. Yeah, 10K to the youth league. That's a lot of cheddar, fam. Swear, down this every month. How come they stopped like two month ago though? What, you want a reward or something? Nah, man. Just T.A. Confidential's in it. Tommy and Av. You get me? Yeah, never mind that. Who the fuck is the Islamic Youth League? Thank you, brother. - As-salamu alaykum - Wa alaykumu s-salam wa rahmatullah Have a seat, brother. I believe you wish to discuss a donation. What did you have in mind? Um... Not a donation. I wanted to speak to you about one of your donors, brother. Usman Rana. I believe he has made significant contributions. Who are you, Mr. Akhtar? Sorry. I'm a private detective brother, I'm looking into his uh... his murder. You know that, right? All I know is that this society is riven with false idols. Sex, alcohol, drugs, money. And every desire has its price. Is that a confession? It is the teaching of Allah. Rana was with a girl. A prostitute. I'm looking for her. I can't help you. Can I just ask... Rana stopped making donations a couple of months ago. Did you two fall out? Wasn't anything major, was it? Just 'cause if it was, it doesn't look great. A high-profile Pakistani businessman gets murdered. It's all hushed-up. SO15 all over it. Geezer's connected to you. You argue with said geezer and he winds up dead. You know, I'm just playing dot-to-dot. Feel free to jump in whenever you want. No need for panic buttons. There's no need for panic. I don't know what you're up to and I don't care. I'm just looking for the girl. Like I said, I can't help you. There is a war going on. And you don't even realize it. The war for our souls. I am prepared. Are you? Dyb dyb dyb Brother! As-salamu alaykum, brother. Long time, no see, huh? - I never met you before, mate. - C'mon, man give me a hug. No offense, if you lot gonna do this, you really gotta get some brothers in the team. - I don't know what you're talking about, mate. - All right? Equal opportunities, man. Ask for some CV's Yo, is that a detective? Yeah, the cover's been blown. Double Turk. No ice. I wasn't sure you'd come. You're paying me. Of course, I'll come. People pay me. I don't come. You're drunk. Yes, but tomorrow, I will be beautiful. What about tonight? A date. Oh. Some call it the uh, "The Girlfriend Experience", yeah? So they say. Yeah, well, what do they know. What about you? Nobody special? When someone goes missing, they say the first 24 hours... On TV, I mean. Firstly, that's missing kids. Second and worse, TV. I'm on it. Okay, let's say Natasha didn't do it. Okay? Somebody could've followed them that night, so. Who else was there, at the Tunnel? - I told you. - I know what you told me. I'm talking about doormen, bar staff, whatever... Tunde. Okay, who's Tunde? He's a dealer. He's there most nights. He's just, you know, some... Some what? Choc ice. Okay. Anyone else? No. No one I could talk to? No. I have to go. Double Turk, no ice. Drinking bourbon? That's my drink. Everyone tells me you guys drink warm beer. Seems to me it's European lager and American whiskey all the way with you Londoners. I'm just sayin'. Expectations. I mean, take you. You were at the hotel. And then you called the cops on that phone, right there. A small-time private eye. Not what I was expecting. You take anything from that hotel room? You know the uh, the worst thing about Londoners? They're not very friendly, not to strangers. You need to stay out of this, Mr. Akhtar. I'm just a... what's the expression? Dipping the wick. I love that. You have a nice day. - I want 20's innit. - No, I don't got it. - Hey you, man! - Catch him! - And don't embarrass me. - Tommy, man. So, what's the mission, bruv? All I want you to do is go in the youth league and listen. Ah, Swear. I need to find out why the mullah fell out with Rana. - Sick, fam. That's sick. - All right, take it easy. What you say, grandpa? What you say? Good, yeah? The main thing is listen, Avid. Black geezers a threat, white geezers a threat. But Pakis can be invisible, even to each other. You need to ease up on that "Paki" shit. It's not cool, you know. All right, so listen, tomorrow at 5, yeah? Somali cafe. Watch and listen. Remember, you're undercover. Aight, man. So, hold it down. Say nuttin. What the fuck, man! I warned you, blud! It's what's gonna happen here. Let me show you the interiors, yeah? Fuck me. Tommy! Thought I'd come around and have a look for myself. How'd you pay for all this? Business is nice, bruvah. Look. What do you think, huh? 24 apartments and townhouses. 2 and 3 beds. 40 minutes from the sea, yeah? American architecture. Swedish interiors. - Polish pullers. - Yeah. Hey, man, our manor's going down. This the regeneration, yeah? You got to get the drugs off the street for that. Oh, hopefully this will get the drugs off the street. 'Cause we're trapped in a better class of person, Tommy. Better than you and me? Fuck, no, sorry, man. You found the Russian girl? No, but I wanted to show you this. - What am I looking at? - Look a bit closer. - Is that Raven Rec? - Yeah. Fuck me, man. Raven Rec. That brings back memories. I reckon her sister is on the estate. - Fuck. - I'm on it. All right? - We need to go. Very sorry. - Good to meet you. - Gentlemen. - I'll be in touch. All right? - Get home safe, yeah? - Okay. - Hey, you gonna sort me out one of them? - Yeah. - Maybe. - I'll hold you to that. - Yes, Tommy man! You made it. - There you are, Lovely. Come on, Tommy. We got burgers, we got hotdogs, beer, whatever you want. - Where's Shelley? - Oh, there's Tommy. Stuart gonna go crazy if they see you together. Lay off, man. Double Turk, no ice. Tunde, right? You know a pro named Natasha? - Comes here a lot. Russian. - Who the fuck are you? DS Saha. Special branch. You're not a cop. Stick fancy dilly's fake ID's a cop. No, Brixton Market. I'm a friend of Melody's. Fuck off. Before I have your legs broken. There's a good chap. Hi, where's Tunde? - Sorry? - Tunde, this is his table. Sorry, this is our table. Have a seat. You all right, mate? Save me some. You taking the fucking piss? What do you want? - Mate, I just wanna talk. - I don't wanna talk. - You know a Natasha? - Yeah. You know a Melody. They come in here a lot? - So who else was here that night? - I don't know. Oh, another dude. I... ask Melody. I seen him with her before. One of her regulars. Waster! Take that! Case closed, Akh! Hey! Hey! Are you okay? Can you get my fags out of my pocket? That looks bad. You should go to hospital for that. I can't. I've got a date. Hey. Tommy. Wild Turkey. I got it from my dad's cupboard. I think it's whiskey. Are you drunk? A little bit. I love it out here. No one giving you grief. Telling you who you're supposed to be. She got with him. He's going out with her. She's a... slag. He... Whatever. I'm cold. Do you want my jacket? Put your arm around me. Um, excuse me sir, can I help you? Yeah, I'm here to see Shelley Stevens. It's okay, it's okay. Jesus, Tommy. Sorry, I'm late. What hap... Come in here. Sit down. Can't say I don't make an effort. No. You're gonna need space where you need to get that stitched. I'll be all right. Do you feel confused? Not more than usual. Look at us. What? - We're old. - Oi, speak for yourself. What happened to us? I dunno, you left. - What was I supposed to do? - I dunno. Stay? Miss Stevens? Yeah, it's okay, I'll lock up. Thanks. Where did that come from? '97 It's confusing. This way. You don't have a clue, do you? You don't even work here. I do work here. I've been here for months. I know exactly what I'm doing. Come on. - I don't have a key. Do you? - No, I've got it. Oh, it's the wrong thing... Okay, this is it. - We're gonna go wake 'em up. - No, no, no, it's fine. - Nice. - Yeah. - Wow. - Yeah. Is this how you roll, then? This is how I roll now. - You know, right? - I know. I can't. Stuart. You've got to break off first. I told you, you're a strange boy. - I'm sorry. - No. It's why I like you. Riding the overground, dreaming away. They seem to stare at me, at first start looking away. Voice deep in my head. Simmer down. Simmer down. For as long as I can remember, she was all that mattered. But the last time we kissed, our world fell apart. Would it be any easier this time? I wanted to stick around and find out, but I had a girl to find and a murder to solve. Death weighs heavier than heartbreak. Simmer down. Simmer down. Mate, you didn't see a Moroccan kid comin' in here about 14-15? - No. - Get him back. Kick him, fam. I'll take that. Waste, man! We fucked him up, all right. All right! What do you say? Me sayin'? I'll have one of these and a coke? I'll have the same, thanks. What? Do you think you're Batman or something? We're out on the street, fam. Chasin' out the smack dealers, bruv. What's wrong with that? Where's next? Syria? Hey, listen. Sit down. Fam, you know what they told me? Empires rise and fall. And this one's gonna fall. Thank you. Which empire is it, exactly? The West, blud. Babylon. Historical diuretic. You takin' a piss? So, what's the deal? Man, found out some gooky shit, you know. Apparently, the mullah knew that Rana was involved in drugs. I even heard them man talkin' about security video. I'll see if I can find out more, innit. - Gonna go now, fam. - All right. Av, don't get nicked. Shut up. I saw the youth league before. They kind of scare people? Patrols, vigilantes, all that? Well, let me tell you. Last 9 months, drugs take down the whole area. Youth league is not the problem. Drugs is a problem. They drive out the dealers, it's okay with me. Thank you. What's your interest in the Islamic Youth League? Same as everyone else. I'm in it for the biryani. They're just kids aren't they? Kids who are tied to all kinds of terrorist activities here and overseas. Usman Rana was bankrolled by the illegal drugs trade. He was a dangerous man. Is that why you killed him? I wanna show you somethin'. Here's Rana in action. Britain is not your home. Join us. The Prophet is our leader. Jihad is our way. - Takbir! Takbir! - Allahu Akbar! These are terrorists, Mr. Akhtar. You know, a wise man once told me... "They only call it terrorism... when they don't know who did it. Or when they did it themselves." Are you sure you didn't take anything from that hotel room? Okay. We'll play this your way. Bring him. Got another stiff. Time of death, unknown I'm at Raven Rec Here's the Russian you've been looking for. Is this what happens when you get in the way? You're done, Mr. Akhtar. Is that clear? Done. We're finished here. Melody, it's Tommy. Give me a call when you get this. Melody, come on, pick up. It's Tommy. Hello? - Whoa! - It's you! - It's me! - Why didn't you say something? I said hello! I've been trying to call you. - What? - Fuck. They're following me. Natasha. I saw her on the news. - Who? Who's following you? - I don't know. Help me. Fuck! Why should I, if you're not straight with me. What? I know there was someone else at the club that night. Who was it? Who was it? A name. I need your punter's name. He's not a punter. He's my boyfriend. It's... Hafiz. Lovely. I'm so sorry I lied to you. But he just... He said to keep him out of it. Look, it's all right. Let's just go. It's fine. Come on, come on! Okay! I'm coming! I can't, Tommy! Come on! Come on, let's go! Did you see him? Is he gone? Dad! Uh... Melody. Melody, Farzad. Why aren't you wearing your shoes? Why aren't you wearing your trousers, Mr. Akhtar? Quite so, my dear. Thank you so much for letting me stay, Mr. Akhtar. I'm not putting you out, am I? Not in the least. But I insist you call me Farzad. It's not a genuine sweep, since he changes his grip on the bat. In fact it's more a genuine left hand shot. - D'you see? D'you see? - Yeah. There's nothing outside. I think we're good. I'm gonna go to bed then. Sleep tight. And may you have the sweetest dreams. - 'Night. - 'Night. Still you come to me with a problem. That's fine. That's how it should be. All right. It's uh... It won't be for long. It's just a couple of days, okay? I confess I'm surprised that the first woman you bring to my house is an African prostitute. Shh... Dad! Calm down. They're trying to kill her? Yeah, it looks like it. Who? Hmm. Fundamentalists. Governmental or otherwise. Fuck knows. Maybe, maybe... someone bowled you a googly. What are you talking about? Well, a googly is a leg break and it spins the other way. But the real success of a googly... Is that it gets into the batsman's head. So... What's in your head, Tommy boy? That's a lot of cheddar. That's half of fucking East Acton. How's he get them so cheap? I'm Emma. Shelley's daughter. We've met at the cemetery. Have a seat. I wanted do ask you about my dad. Um... Does you mum know you're here? She won't talk about him. She never talks about him. She says it's better that way. I think it's better if you talked to your mum. Please. You go to his grave. You must have been tight. - I'm sorry, I just think... - I'm seventeen. Please. All right, it was a big gang of us. - He is one of us. - And uh, Supposed to be no discrimination, innit? Stuart was always the top man. Everybody loved Stuart. He was loyal. That if you had grief, he had your back. You Paki cunt! Fuck you up! Hold on! Nice one, Stuart! Sorry. Hello? It's me, Tommy boy. Are you coming home? I'm really sorry, I've got to go. No, it's fine. - Good on you, mate. Well done. - Well done, Stuart. Nice, Stuart. You fucking bastard. He knows. Hello mate. Yeah. Double Turk, no ice. Hi. Are you okay? Yeah. Do you wanna stay here, I'll be back in a minute? Yeah? - What's this? - Oh, I told you, Tommy boy. They won't be satisfied until we're all gone. We're not selling the house. Forcing us out. If you get any more letters like this, just tell me. What is going on here? They're photos of your mum. - And you see that? Can you see? Uganda. - Oh, yeah. That was the day we left. We had to hide all the jewelry because uh... They would have taken everything. Um, I've got to go out today. Can you stay inside for me, yeah? - Yeah. Yeah, we'll be fine. - All right. We get on all right. Don't we Farzad? Ah, famously, my dear. Famously. Happy families. When I look at these pictures, it just breaks my heart. Yeah? What? No. No, I haven't. Well, what happened? I'm standing outside Kensal Rise Station following a number of arrests across London, for which the mullah is the most high-profiled. Tension is building here as Al-Dabaran supporters are demanding his immediate release. All right, I'm on my way. The security service states the arrests are a result of a 6-month-long anti-terror investigation. Hey, Lovely! Lovely, man! Whoa, whoa, he's with me. What are you doing here? It's all good. Mr. Ansari. Look you can't trust these spooks, man. Free the mullah! Keep it brief. Tell them he'll be released after questioning. It's payback. Get this crowd under control. Free the mullah! Free him! Brothers, you all know me. I know you're angry about these attacks on our community. We all are. - Avid. - Fuck, Tommy man! What's going on? The mullah found out what happened to Rana. - You sure? - That's why they cuffed him up. I can't talk right now. I can't be seen with you, man. I've seen that guy, you know. What guy? I saw him in the security video. The mullah's got a hold of it from someone. Meet me outside the youth center after evening prayers. I'll have something for you by then. I got to go. Listen, brothers, we've gotta do this in a calm manner. Listen! Brothers, calm down! Calm down! Brothers! - What up, bro? - Fuck man! Fuckin' hell, Tommy. What the fuck, man? That's not even funny. - Yeah, it is. - No, it's not. Fuckin' hell. Scared the fuckin' hell out of me. - What happened to your face? - I don't even know. It's a toss-up between the spooks and the beard brigade. - All right, yeah. - They're all friends of yours, anyway. Um, I know about Melody. What, she told you? You lied to me, man. Well, come on, I didn't lie to you. I just didn't tell you. There's a difference, yeah? Seriously, look. She rang me because Natasha hadn't come back. I tried calling Usman because his phone was off. Right. I've got a hooker calling me at home, Tommy. Talking about going to the old bill. What would you do? Yeah? Yeah. I couldn't have that. I didn't think he was dead. So I just sent that to you, man. What else am I supposed to do? I've got to ask you, man, did you kill her? Fuck off, man. I'm not even... I've got to ask you. You! Fuck, Tommy man! Fuck. Yeah? We're supposed to be on the same fucking team. All right? Fuckin' hell, man. It's the Russian, Tommy. - It's not the fucking Russian. - Well, how do you know? Because she's fucking dead. She got fished out of the canal last night. Look, they're coming after everyone who was with you at the club. Rana's dead. Natasha's dead. They tried to kill Melody last night. Don't worry, she's at Dad's place. Oh, man. Just watch your back, man. They'll be after you next. Come on, Avid, where are you? Don't fucking move! What happened to you? What happened? What have you done with Avid? - No, no, the light. Turn it off. - Why? - They're right there, they're comin'. - What? Who? Dealers? Feds? Who? - Feds. With American accents. - What? They smashed up our computers. They were looking for something. What, you think it's just a coincidence? Mr. Rana brought trouble. All that caliphate shit. They kill him. And now, they arrest the mullah. This is war, bruv. They're trying to destroy our community. I don't have time for this. Where the fuck is Avid? Avid? They got him. Sorry. I'm looking for Avid. Avid Elbaz. - One moment. - Avid Elbaz. He's a kid, and... Victor. - What happened? - I dunno. Found him in an alley. You can't go in there. Oi! Come on, man. Oi, Oi, T.A. Confidential. Tommy and Avid. Excuse me, you can't be in here. Mrs. Elbaz. Jesus, haven't you done enough? I trusted you, Tommy. You did it. I didn't. I'm gonna get to the bottom of this. You did it. Get out! Get out! Get out! Fuck who! Who the fuck! Oh, fuck. Fuck. Shelley, sorry, I'm sorry. You okay? Did she come here? What? Emma. Why didn't you tell me? Um, she... asked me not to. I'm her mother. I'm her fucking mother. Emma came here. Look what she could've walked into. And you telling her about Stuart, Jesus, Tommy who do you think you are? - Well, he's her dad. - She's my daughter. - So then, talk to her. - What do I say? Um, yeah, your dad was... a really great guy. Trouble is I was in love with one of his mates and that's why he killed... - Shelley. - Oh, God. Shelley. That's for what, Tommy? You gonna try and be her friend and tell her about Stuart and fuck her mum at the hotel. Is that your plan? Because I just need more than that. It's not good enough. What do you want? Tommy, what do you want? I want to know why you told Stuart about you and me. Why did you do it? Huh? I never told him anything. Who else would... Fuckin' Lovely, then. Lovely. Fuckin' Lovely. Do you know, it was only you who ever called him that? Shelley. I'm sorry. Shelley. Please, Tom. Stop. Shelley. Why, it's another life, isn't it? You need to let it go though. Get down, Stu. I know they've been going on behind your back but you gotta let it go. What are you doing, man? Tommy fuckin' Akhtar. You're supposed to be my friend. - Fuck you. - Stuart! I'm the real deal. The real fuckin' deal. And I loved you. I'm sorry. Stuart! Stu! No! By the time you see this, I will no doubt, be detained. The security services aren't interested in the truth. But they are right about one thing. The network of our brothers is even more extensive than even they dare to fear. I entrust this security video to our young brother. In the hope that you can see that justice is served. No one knows what is hidden from them as a reward for their good deeds. They're coming after everyone who was with you at the club. Melody's at Dad's place. Pick up, Dad. Please! - Dad, Dad... - Tommy boy! Dad. We had nothing in, Tommy boy. I might thought she'd like some breakfast. Dad, there's someone at the house. You've got to get out of here. - In the house? - Yeah. Can you do that for me? Just go. Okay? Let me go! Let me go! You fuck! Let me go! We've got to get on with our lives, Tommy. We've got to let it go. - We gonna do this, or what? - Easy, man. Fuckin' hell. Please, wait, wait. Wait. No, no, please. - I don't know anything. - You let me down, babe. I didn't say anything. I didn't speak to anyone. - Are we doing this, or what? - Just wait, man. For fucks sake. - Wait, Tommy. - Hafiz, what? Shut the fuck up. Tommy, man... Why couldn't you stop yourself from fucking going on, man? Listen, it's not about fucking religion. Drugs drive down the prices and we buy the real estate. Yeah? Everybody wins. Rana just got too greedy. This is our manor, Lovely. What the fuck are you doing? Fuck our manor, Tommy. It's a shithole. - Come on. - Wait, man. - You don't have to do this - No, listen to me, bruvah. I'm sorry. - Wait, wait, wait! - Tommy? Are you home? - Dad? - Sit. Hafiz Ansari. You're a disgrace to your family. And you, you white bloody bugga. I seen your type before. - Dad - Sit down! I'm not scared of you! King's African Rifles. Dad. I told you I was ready for them, Tommy boy. This time, I am. My house. My son. Dad. Dad. Your off stump. The moral compass. Tommy, I'm sorry, man. I'm... You covered up a fuckin' murder. You stay here. Fucking Yanks. You all right, Cal? - You ready for the spooks? - Go on, then. Greed was Lovely's mistress and he pursued her till the end. Turns out the spooks didn't give a toss that he killed Rana. They were only after his contacts so they could take down Rana's network. As long as Lovely kept feeding them information, they were willing to protect him. They just couldn't believe the mullah only wanted to get the drugs off the street. As for me, I mean, I can't see myself in one of them posh new flats. But I have acquired a new family. Dad, this is Emma. I told you about. - Come in, Merry Christmas. - Avid, Mrs. Elzad's son. Merry Christmas, Tommy boy. - How you doing? - Yes, I'm fine. Come on in. Everyone, lets... What do you think? I think we need that um, army outfit. - You know, the bullet belt, boots, boobs. - Oh, right. Yeah. - Yeah, Farzad will have a heart attack. - Fuck off, Tommy. What have we got here? Yeah, sort the sprouts out. Make yourself useful. Wow, Melody, this looks amazing. Actually, it's Laura. - Laura. - Yeah. There it goes. I was just speaking of. Hope you're all very hungry. Wonderful, wonderful. Which bit did you want me to cut first? - I think the breast. - I usually come to them later. Bugga shite! Pardon my French, we're missing the Queen. Yeah, this... okay. Our Lord was not born into a traditional family. - Hey, sorry I couldn't get away. - It's all right. What are you doing? Making up for lost time. Now, come on, I'm starving. Look who I found. Hello. Lovely to see you. - God bless us, everyone. - Cheers. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Well, it's not exactly happy families. But it never is. But we've laid some ghosts to rest. We could leave some space for now. But will it take? Will it last? I dunno. We just jump in and do the best we can.
