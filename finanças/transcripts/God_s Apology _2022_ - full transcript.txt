♪ ♪ Bim, guess what? [gunshot] [James] That's closure. Now for season two. [♪ Cyril Giroux: "II Tuo Respiro"] ♪ ♪ Hello, viewers. Or should I say buon giorno, with a little wave of the hand like that, because that is supposedly what they do around here. Yes, I am in Italy, and I bet when I say that, none of you go, "OMG, why has he gone to that hellhole," because no one has ever said that about Italy. Italy is generally regarded as having the most enviable lifestyle on the planet. Now, there are many clichés and stereotypes about Italy and the Italians, apart from the one about waving your arms around a lot. Chief amongst them, though, must be the belief in la dolce vita, the sweet life, the pursuit and embrace of simple pleasures as the bedrock for human fulfillment. Now, does la dolce vita really exist? And more importantly, if it does, can a shabby and slightly uptight Englishman achieve it? Well, as I'm sure they must say on Italian television... [speaks Italian] Let's find out. Right, you can get to that cheesy pre-title bit now. ♪ ♪ Anyone can make a travelogue with the right ingredients. How's my helmet? A dash of jaunty music... [screeching] ...a bit of national dress... Have you ever before painted someone dressed up like a bird? ...and a presenter who knows his culo from his elbow. It doesn't amaze you, but it would've amazed you if you'd been here then. What do we know about Italy? - Viva l'italia! - [shouting in Italian] [James] Yes, the hand gestures. Also, fashionistas, fast cars, - kicking balls... - [both oohing] ...and every carbohydrate under the sun. Nothing can stop pizza. But I'm going a bit deeper...

Not a Cinquecento, not a Ferrari or a Maserati. No, it's a Fiat Panda because the Panda is excellent, and it is simply part of the dust of Italy. I have two principle objectives for this trip. The first is to see if I can arrive at a sort of ten commandments of being Italian and living this dolce vita. But I know one already: do not drink a cappuccino after 11:00 a.m. That is considered very bad form. My other objective is to not become fat. ♪ ♪ As you may have guessed from this handy map, we're starting in Sicily, known for its lemons, the Mafia and the Sicilian defense in chess. Our first port of call is the capital, Palermo. And, with over 250 days of sun a year, Sicily is an absolute gift for TV and filmmakers. [thunder crashes] Buon giorno, io no, uh, uno... no lo ombrello. I do not have an umbrella. This is the weather today. Today I was going to go into town and meet my guide Claudia, um, but it's... we've sort of postponed it because the impression I get... again, this may be a cliché... Sicily, because it's an outdoor society, is not equipped for rain. Plus, of course, there will be no Italian men out because they'll be worried about their hair. And I understand that. Still, with over 250 days of sunshine a year, statistically, the next day should be... ♪ ♪ Palermo city center. It was the crossroads of the ancient world. It's also the crossroads of the modern one. And no, not everyone here is a mobster. Certainly not this one. Today I am joined by Claudia. - Buon giorno. Who will be... - Buon giorno. ...my guide for Sicily. I'm already waving my arms around a lot. Uh, al vostro servizio. - Oh, I am at your service. - No, I'm at your service. [James] Over the centuries, every civilization and its dog has had a bash at Palermo, from the ancient Greeks to the Vikings, the Normans to the Moors, the butchers, the bakers, the mosaici makers, even the Italians. [Claudia] This is the famous Church of Martorana. Through the centuries, um, who's restored the church decided to add the architectural style of the era. [James] I would say that that end looks Islamic, that doorway is definitely newer. - What, 17th century? Maybe. - [Claudia] Yeah. This is the most celebrated church, and it became the symbol of Palermo. [James] Originally built in the 12th century, this architectural smorgasbord houses some incredible Byzantine artwork. But it's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a film crew to observe silence in a functioning church, so Claudia and I are going gonzo. So, we'll have to get a selfie stick. - Okay. - And film it... - Oh. - ...with the iPhone. - Other phones are available. - Great idea. Okay, there will be a selfie stick on this stall here. - I'm absolutely sure of it. - Okay. I'll give you a million pounds if she hasn't got one - by the time we get there. - Okay, let's do it. [James] Ah, here. - Prego. - Ah, grazie mille. [chuckles] Grazie. [James] Fantastico. Presenting I mosaici di Martorana, an original production. ♪ ♪ [James] It's absolutely incredible. Just the colors are amazing. Ah! That is superb. And Christ actually is on high because he's at the highest point of the church, and looking down on you. [Claudia] It's all full of Greek inscriptions. [James] Jesus gets in a lot of appearances in here, doesn't he? [Claudia laughs] [James] It's a good job he didn't have an agent. I bet my camerawork's terrible. I think we're going to get thrown out in a minute. Once reunited with our crew of supposed professionals, the next stop is the city's anarchic heart. [Claudia] We are in the famous Piazza Pretoria, Pretoria Square. The square is also called the square of Shame because of the shameful expenses the government afforded to bring the fountain from Florence to Palermo. Sadly, it became a symbol of the bad government. [James] And that's not the only reason for its name. - That one's got a deformed penis. - [laughs] [Claudia] Because the nuns were offended by the naked statues. This is why, probably, they cut arms - and parts of their body. - That explains why his-his old chap's a bit... - in a bit of a state. - [Claudia] Yeah. Yeah. [James] And why have they knocked her arms off? Arms aren't offensive. Uh, probably because they were gesturing like that. - Oh. - Yeah, so... [James] The sisters chiseled her nipples off as well. So did Michelangelo give David a very small penis so that nuns in the next artistic era - would not be offended by him? - [Claudia laughs] [James] Right, that's culture ticked off. Now we can relax. Today, Claudia and I are going fishing, because that's what you do when you're on holiday. Actually we probably shouldn't say when you're on holiday. That's what you do when you are, uh, uncovering the secrets of a really rather complex history of an island, Sicily, much of whose fortune is based on fishing. That's why we're going fishing. This is Sciacca, one of the biggest fishing ports in Sicily. Our host for our research trip is Matteo. Here. - Grazie. [grunts] - Perfect. Okay. That was a bit uncool. Clear aft. So it's time to set sail on Sicily's bountiful and surprisingly turbulent waters. Since I once hosted an unsuccessful cooking show, I plan to knock up a spot of lunch with our catch. Uh, situation update: it's quite choppy. Okay, let's throw some bait? You're on this? This is... This is, like, a shrimp. - [Claudia] It's delicious. - Do I eat it? - [laughs] No, no, no, please. - Non mangiare? Here comes the big one. - [both laugh] - [James] Okay. Despite the increased risk of sleeping with the fishes... I hope I don't just stick it in my finger. ...we bait our hooks and our breath. Il pesce is on the linea when it goes "zzz." Now there's nothing to do but wait for something to tug on my rod. Meanwhile, back on terra firma, the locals are rustling up a couple of side dishes to accompany my fishy centerpiece. Now this just in, Matteo seemed to have caught something because his rod was bending, but apparently, - he's-he's caught a rock. - No. Rock. So we've caught the planet Earth from our fishing boat so far. Not sure that'll fit on the grill. Then, by a miracle for once not manufactured by television... - Oh, it is here? - [Claudia] Fishy, fishy. - [James] There, there. Fish, fish. - [Claudia] Fish, fish, fish. [James] Am I turning it the right way? He's gone over there somewhere. Ooh, this is a big fish. Yeah, it's a big fish, big fish. It's a battle worthy of Hemingway, Melville or J.R. Hartley. It's a proper fish. - [Matteo] Amberjack. - Amberjack? [Claudia] Amberjack. Is that big enough to eat? [Claudia] Yes, it's a portion. We need ten of these. [James] One down, nine to go. ♪ ♪ - Oh, it's really heavy. - It's a bit heavy. The locals are already lining up in rapturous and ravenous anticipation. Catch is in. - [grunts] - [chuckles] [James] Come and behold the fruit of the fecund ocean. [speaking Italian] Lunch with fish. Damn! Beautiful, so wonderful. There's food for everyone, guys. There's a lot, there's a lot beneath here. But this one is beautiful, it's silver actually. There's more beneath. [James] Impressionante. It's impressive, it's impressive. - Yes impressive, it's still alive. - There it is. Beautiful, beautiful. Gold and silver, beautiful. [applause] [James] Grazie. Bravo, bravo. [James] Apparently, one pesky pesce has sparked quite the celebration. [lively chatter] [James] Oh, here comes our fish. Here's the fish. - [Claudia] Oh... - [applause] Everybody has to have a small piece. [speaking Italian] When you have caught it yourself and you eat it... it is beautiful. [James] I don't know if it's all this fresh air, or that busker on the mandolin in the background, but this certainly feels like la dolce vita to me. I am absolutely amazed at how my very piccolo pesce has turned into this enormous feast. Something very biblical about that, and look at all these new friends I've made. I am truly a fisher of men. With our bellies pleasantly full, it's time to depart. Or so I thought. - Oh, is this the pasta course? - [Claudia] Yes. There might be a massive steak after this for all I know. Actually, there was no massive steak. There was, however, some ham. [singing in Italian] [laughter] Forgot the words. [James] Actually, I need to have a bit of a word with you about the threat of Italian lunch. [Claudia] In Sicily, we have the obsession of food. We love to share with friends and-and to show them our generosity and our hospitality. So is... if that happens every day, we'll be the size of Fiat Pandas, each one of us. So far, that's religion, culture, sport, cookery and a warning about incipient obesity. The next thing to try, you've probably already guessed, is estate agency. Hello, viewers. Fancy finding you up here, right at the top of the Castello Manfredonico, in the Comune di Mussomeli, once one of the wealthiest regions of Sicily. I'd like to read to you from the handy English information sheet that you get when you arrive. It's rather lovely, actually. "The architectural completeness melts with the rock. Thus the work of man blooms spontaneously." Good, isn't it? I might try blooming a bit more spontaneously myself. The castle today, as you can probably see, is a little bit on the tatty side. Wait till you see the rest of the town. [scoffs] A thriving and wealthy town in the 16th century, Mussomeli is now home to only a few thousand people, none of whom you can see here. Depopulation reached crisis point in the '80s when locals were even prepared to move to Surrey in England. So the mayor came up with a plan. This is Cinzia. She is the local estate agent for the historic town center, and she's going to show me this house, which is currently on the market for one euro. - One euro. - [Claudia] One euro. [James] Wow, look at that. Now, if I was a British estate agent, I would say that this is an ideal first-time property with numerous period features in need of sympathetic renovation, i.e. a bit of a craphole. But it is a complete house. It has a roof. It has services. They're not turned on, so there's no water or electricity, which is why we're using the torches, but they're all here. Actually, there's a really spooky sort of medieval bit back here. Look at this. [Sean] It's good 'cause you're shining the torch like it's Blair Witch, mate. - What do you mean? - [Sean laughs] [vocalizes] Oh, that's quite light. Some of the wiring looks a bit dodgy, but it's no worse than the Alfa Romeo 155, to be honest. This is very nice. I mean, whichever way you look at it, it's a lot for a euro. Sounds like an offer I can't refuse. [Cinzia speaking Italian] Maybe because one euro sounds very attractive. It's the price of a coffee. What's the catch? Cinzia explains that although the house costs one euro, the new owner must restore the outside to an agreed standard within three years or face a five-grand penalty. But what's in it for her? It occurs to me that the estate agent's commission on one euro is pretty feeble. [chuckles] That's about .01 of a euro. - [laughter] - [Cinzia speaks Italian] How do you... How can you possibly make a living? Sorry. Scusi. But if we can... 'Cause we've been hearing this. The-the... Some of these keys are from about 1850. [Claudia] It costs more than the house. [James] This is your property empire. Could be worth as much as 30 euros. [all laugh] [conversing in Italian] No, it's a fixed fee of 490 euros per house. Now, Dan, you were talking about how much you would like to buy - a house around here. You'd like... - Well, for one euro, - it'd be stupid not to. - Yeah, but... - It can't just be one euro. - No. There is a little bit more involved, but here's the euro, - in any case. - Who do I give it to? - Cinzia? - Cinzia will take your euro. I'll take this house. You have actually bought it, I'm afraid. - [all laugh] - Now it's done. It's done. Yeah. [James] You have to pay 490 euros - commission, I'm afraid... - [Dan] Okay. ...to Cinzia, and you owe me a euro. [all laugh] - But you do have a house in Italy. - [Dan] I'll give you... [all laugh] Doppio espresso? It's that or a semidetached bungalow. [all laugh] While Dan busied himself arranging a buy-to-let mortgage to pay me back my euro, I went for a contemplative spin. And the funny thing about that town is it is the one-euro town. So, after we'd looked at the houses, we went off, and we had a quick slice of pizza. And a big slice of pizza was a euro, and an espresso was a euro. Everything in the town is a euro. So it's either a very, very cheap house or, in reality, the euro was about £1.2 million. Now, viewers, we're 20 minutes into this episode, - and I haven't really embarrassed myself yet. - [lively drumming] This looks like an opportunity. This is Ciwara in the historical center of Palermo, and, as you might have already guessed, it's known for its live Afrobeats scene. I like the sound of this place already. Hang on. - Here, there? - [horn honks] Yeah, the driving is a little bit random, but think about our preconceptions of Sicily. They're all based on things like films about the origins of the Mafia and so on, but it's not. It's this. It's perfectly modern and multiculti. And it has una birra, tre birra. And somewhere over there is Claudia. I think. If I go and meet her, find her, we can have... spend the rest of the evening, hours, doing this. Do you know where she is? Ah, there she is. Blissfully unaware that it's time for some fascinating geopolitical context. Sicily is the stepping-stone between Africa and Europe and has a famously welcoming attitude to African immigration. Provided they bring their own instruments. - Ready? Salute. - Salute. [James] But please don't worry that the old English bloke with the hips from Thunderbirds is going to join in the dancing. Excellent. These guys are amazing. [James] Mind you, the company's good, and the local Sicilian beer is excellent. There's only one way I could ruin this perfect moment. Seeing where this scene was heading, director Tom rushed in some locals to act as a human shield. ♪ ♪ - [cheering and applause] - Bravo! Spiacente. It won't happen again. Hey, map fans, guess what? Yes, we're leaving the west of Sicily and heading east through the island's midriff to Sicily's second largest city, where I'm going to talk complete bollocks. Welcome to Catania, where you join me in Piazza Duomo and where we are going to address the elephant in the square, u Liotru. Now, he's very old. He is believed to have come from ancient Rome, and he is, of course, the symbol of the city. He's in shop signs. The logos of sports club shields. You can buy a little lucky trinket of u Liotru from the street sellers who are wandering around here. But now we arrive at some confusion, because I believed, talking to the locals, that somehow, his testicles had been removed out of modesty, but this turns out probably not to be true, because elsewhere in the town, there is a statue of a horse whose testicles were removed because they offended Saint Agatha, the patron saint of Sicily. She's up there in the duomo, on the day of her feast. And then later, his... his boys were put back on again. But that does at least allow me to talk about Saint Agatha, who was martyred in the middle of the third century. She was stretched on the rack, torn apart with hooks, and her breasts were removed with pincers. But as a result of that, the locals remember her with these faintly ridiculous breast-inspired sticky buns. So, to recap, the elephant still has his balls. The horse lost his balls but got them back again later. Saint Agatha is long dead, but at least we get a funny nipple cake to celebrate her. And I hope that's all clear, because now I'm going to go and buy a hat. I'm really sorry. I've just learned from someone over in the café that apparently the horse's plum sack wasn't removed. It was merely covered up for fear of offending Saint Agatha during her feast day. Everything else I said there is broadly correct. God, this is disgusting. ♪ ♪ Anyway, time to make a Saint Agatha bun of myself in the next scene. Now, obviously, another Italian cliché is that they all dress impeccably. So, in a bid to shake off my scruffy yet uptight Englishness and impress Claudia, I'm going to attempt fashion. Now, in Italy, the word for a hat in general is a cappello, but in Sicily, they have a specific type of hat, a-a flat cap which is called... wait for it... a coppola. It's the traditional hat of Sicily, supposedly, so let's go in and see if we can find one big enough for my simply gigantic head. ♪ ♪ - Buon giorno. Uh, una coppola, per favore. - Sì. Ma io uno molto grande testa. [clerk] Okay, a very big head. So big brains. Good. - [James] E-Exactly, yes. - [laughter] - Hey. - Ah. [crew exclaims] - Va bene? - [clerk] Your eyes is perfect. - [James] Molto gentile. Grazie. - [laughs] If you get the angle right... I mean, you don't want to just wear it like that. That just knocks 50 off your IQ immediately, doesn't it? It's fashionable. [laughs] - Grazie. I will take it. - [clerk] We got a winner. ♪ ♪ [James] Armed with my coppola and my magical disappearing bag... it's time to see what Claudia thinks. - [laughs] - Buona sera. Buona sera. [laughs] Um... - Mm. Così così. - You meant... No. "Così così." What's "così così"? Così così. So and so. So-so. It's perfect with the color of your eyes. - But... - But? That's okay. It's fine. If you don't like it, - you don't like it. That's... Now I know. - [laughs] Wow, she must really hate my eyes. I was particularly disappointed that Claudia, of whom I've grown extremely fond, um, was so dismissive of my coppola. But I sort of get where she's coming from. This is a problem I've-I've alluded to many times in the past. Expensive clothes, cheap clothes, secondhand clothes... it doesn't really make any difference with me. That, in the window of a shop, looks quite stylish. It's interesting. It's an interesting pattern. It would probably look good on you. Lots of other people. Many members of our crew, men and women. You put it on my head... ...and it looks crap. ♪ ♪ After that crushing disappointment, it's time to lift my spirits. I'm now heading for a Sicilian landmark that I should be able to find without the satnav or even a paper map. I should be able to find it by looking out of the window. It's quite big. Sort of triangular in shape but with a bit missing from the top. I need my Canadian jacket for this. And, ironically, a hat. Buon giorno. Today, we are three-quarters of the way up Mount Etna, Europe's most active volcano. And that might sound pretty daring, but actually, if you look over here... Look. Snack bars, competing excursions to the summit. It is a fantastic mountain. It was the-the forge of the gods. It looms very large in the conscience of the people of Sicily, especially in Catania and Messina, because every now and then... February 2021, for example... it dumps a huge pile of volcanic ash all over streets and rooftops and cars. And last time, it cost half a million euros to sweep it up. Anyway, we're going to go with some scientists all the way, or almost all the way to the summit and the crater. And it's perfectly safe. Unless it blows up. ♪ ♪ Etna has been erupting on and off since 475 BCE. Well, presumably since before then, but no one bothered to write it down. So, this is Giuseppe, who's one of our volcanologists. And what happens if it goes off? Recently, it's making an eruption every month, so in principle, we are close. [James] Okay, we're due one, chaps. I should have, uh, explained, actually, that the crew is in the back of the car for obvious reasons. They're being remarkably quiet. - Yeah. - Um, usually when they're in the car together, it's just an absolute solid wall of moaning. [chuckles] I have to say it is looking a bit smoky, though. ♪ ♪ So, the molten bit of the earth is a part of the big bang - that's still going on, in effect. Isn't it? - Yeah. Yeah. [James] And then, as we continue our ascent into what appears to be The Land That Time Forgot, the crew helpfully pipes up. Can you still see the road up front? [James] I can see that it's a very long way down on the right, so I would advise not looking that way. In fact, I wish I hadn't. Well, we're still going up. We still can't see anything. ♪ ♪ Finally, we arrive at the main crater... ...where it's actually not smoke at all. Just freezing fog. Even though I can't feel my face, I summon my professionalism. So, finally, here we are, viewers, within a few dozen meters of the gaping main crater of Etna. Silent, sleeping, but we know, despite the research and the reassurances of the scientists, that at any moment, that could explode with an enormous crash, causing the mayor of Catania to stop at whatever he's doing and turn around and say, as the mayor of Pompeii must have done once, "What the bloody hell was that?" Moments before being consumed by the flow of lava, the molten core of the earth wreaking its revenge on civilization for its arrogance. Just remember that. Lunch? ♪ ♪ Actually, I need to explain this to the viewers so that they don't think we're complete idiots, but our original plan was that we'd come up here, and we'd be able to do a few simple experiments, and we'd be able to fly a drone over the crater and actually look down into the volcano, which would have been quite remarkable. Here is some library footage. ♪ ♪ As a consolation prize for seeing the square root of bugger all, Giuseppe gives me a whistle-stop tour of the office. Is this some sort of volcano DEFCON? In some sense. ♪ ♪ [James] Turns out that as well as being a volcanologist, Giuseppe's also a keen baker. When a cake is, uh, is cooking, inflate. - [James] Yeah. - [Giuseppe] So, when the magma is coming up, the summit of the volcano inflate. When the eruption start, - start to deflate. - Yes. Like a cake. [James] The team monitor how well Etna is baking with 150 sensors based in and around the crater. Do you ever wake up at night thinking, "Shit, there's a massive volcano just down the road"? [Giuseppe] Italy is a leader in the world - for monitoring active volcanoes. - [James] Okay. But because, anyway, you can sit en-enjoying a glass of wine - and watching eruptions in a sweet life. - Exactly. - La dolce vita. [laughs] - Glass of wine, watching the eruptions. So, there's our second Italian rule. We've arrived at one. No cappuccino after 11:00 a.m. Live near a volcano and just have a glass of wine. - [Giuseppe] Yes. - Thank you. That's excellent advice. Ironically, Etna blew off a week later, and Giuseppe has been molto schifoso ever since. [laughs] Which gives me a rather convenient segue. I didn't actually appreciate this, but the slopes of Etna are ideal terroir for making wine. Now interestingly in 2001, Sicilian wine, particularly the wines grown on the slopes of Etna, were given global prominence when a vineyard was bought by Mick Hucknall, his cantato vineyard. You know, once he was the frontman of a very successful international rock band. And now he simply makes red. ♪ ♪ I'm afraid that's all the Simply Red we can afford, because, well, money's too tight to mention. ♪ ♪ Anyway, today's Bacchanalian bonanza is at Barone di Villagrande, within spewing distance of Etna. - Buon giorno. - Buon giorno. Run by Marco, a tenth-generation wine-maker and his partner in vine, Alfonso. Are people surprised that vines - grow on a volcano? - [Marco] Oh, yes. The soil of the volcano is really special, was created by lava eruptions, so eruption on eruption. But today the soil is very rich, and the grape is, uh, in the perfect state of maturity now. [James] Italy leads the world in wine production, and is home to more than 500 varieties of grapes, over 50 of which are indigenous to Sicily. More importantly... What happened to Mick Hucknall's vineyard? Uh, it's been sold. - Oh, really? Oh. - Yes. [James] That's a shame. Probably means I'll never, never, never know him. Anyway... ♪ ♪ You join us at a very exciting time. Claudia and I are about to take part in the harvest. How many crates would you pick in a day? [Marco] About 80. - 80 in a day? - Yeah. [Marco] So you have a lot of work to do. [James] The vineyard staff conveniently have the afternoon off. So, Claudia and I have to do a full shift before we can enjoy the fruits of our labors. But let's just imagine we've been hard at work picking grapes... That'll do. ...and cut straight to the drinking. Bingo. Or as the Italians say... bingo. This is an Italian wine tasting. I'm always amazed that these work on television, because the only thing you can appreciate about the wine is what color it is, which is generally white or red or possibly pink. We will also have some food because we are in Italy and we are stationary, therefore we must be fed. That is the rules. We can move onto the first wine. [Alfonso] The Salina Bianco. This wine is floral and intense in taste, especially in the aroma. [James] Slightly mineral, not too acidic. Very nice. For this wine is caramelized onion, uh... with dried figs and walnuts. Are you going to try that? No. I don't like onions. - [laughter] - You don't like onions? - Yeah. - Salute. [Claudia] Prego. - Buono? - Mm-hmm. Now, viewers, I realize that I'm being incredibly indulgent here, quaffing fine wines like this one, which, for the benefit of you at home, is pink. The underlying flavor is like very ripe fruit. Followed by Sicilian delicacies that you can't taste. [Alfonso] Pumpkin mille-feuille, uh... - with ricotta. - [James] Mille-feuille ricotta. - [Claudia] Oh... - [James] You don't like ricotta? I don't. - Are you Italian? - [Claudia laughs] [James] Next, for those of you watching in the 1970s, this is a white wine. It's very drinkable, as they say - in the wine world. - [Marco] Yeah. [Alfonso] Because you have to try it with the pasta. - Please. - Please. Just try. [Marco] You're acting like an Italian's mother. Italians are feeders, aren't they? - [Marco] Yes! - They make you eat food. And finally my favorite of all the colors... red. Silence, please; I would like to do a proper wine tasting. This is how you actually do it if you're taking it seriously. Not just larking about, so we start... ♪ ♪ Nice. [laughter] Omar Khayyam writing in Persia in the... 11th century, I think, said that you should drink wine because everything else was futile because you were simply going to die. "The caravan starts for the dawn of nothing. Oh, make haste." And he was right. Remember, alcohol is God's apology for making us self-aware. Thank you for watching. [laughs] I love this. People should simply drink wine. It was gifted to us so that we could be at peace. It was at around this point that Claudia remembered we still had 79 crates to fill. The next day, with Claudia still working her way through the final 60 crates, I'm winding "O sole mio" to the small hilltop village of Castelmola. Now, Italy is widely known for its glittering contributions to the world of music, from Monteverdi and Pavarotti to Italo disco legend, Gazebo. But Sicily has its own mercifully unique contribution. Now, most English people would associate the bagpipe with Scottish expansionism into places like Leicester Square, but actually the history of the instrument is a lot more complicated than that. It may have been known in antiquity to the ancient Greeks. The bagpipes in Europe almost certainly made their way here via Spain for obvious reasons from the Arab world, and in the Middle Ages, the bagpipe was simply one of many popular folk instruments that have since fallen into disuse, like the racket, the crumhorn, the rebeck, the hurdy gurdy, the portative organ. Here in Sicily, they have a particular strain of bagpipe called the ciaramedda. And I'm going to meet a man called Pippo, who makes them and I'm afraid... plays them. The ciaramedda, with its bag made from sheep or goatskin, was traditionally used by farmers to cheer up the locals as they herded their livestock around. [speaking Italian] "Zambogna" is the general word for "bagpipe." Now that's interesting. Um, how the hell do you play that without four hands? Luckily for everyone in the room, we were about to find out. [bagpipe playing] Tragically, the ciaramedda almost died out completely. But thankfully, Pippo has helped keep the instrument alive by making them for the last 60 years. Bravissimo, signor. - Fantastico. Very, very... - [applause] I think I like the ciaramedda. Um, I was trying to work out the fingering as you were doing that, so... [vocalizing] ...and that's the leading note there? - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah? And then, this side, God knows what you were doing there. That is virtually impossible 'cause you need two brains. One to play the recorder and another one to play the recorder. Why am I even agreeing to this? Can I try one with a bag? Brace yourselves for the sound of me fingering some beautifully turned apricot wood and blowing through an ex-goat. [playing notes] That was very briefly Ivor Cutler's "Oh, you, lemon flower, the leaf is sweet, but the fruit is sour." Did anybody get that? [all] No. The slightly alarming thing about that was as the bag deflated, it smelled faintly of stale vino rosso. But that might have been something to do with last night. [laughter] So, to play the ciaramedda, you need four hands, the lungs of a horse, and to have not drunk a vineyard dry the day before. Anyway, token toe-curling bit ticked off, now I can enjoy Pippo on his lathe in his exquisite workshop. Bella. While watching a craftsman create something from nothing is my cup of chino... The smell of that wood being cut off is tremendous. ...director Tom has other ideas... - [Tom] James? - Yes. [Tom] I know you love the lathe and everything, but you've got a performance in about half an hour. What, my performance? You mean their performance? No, you're playing, half an hour, 12:00 on the square. Well, I can't possibly play the bagpipes. [Tom] Yes you can, you'll be fine. Well, I can't, I haven't got big enough lungs, and I don't know the fingering. For once, I decided to stand firm and not be made to look foolish in the name of light entertainment. ♪ ♪ I was overruled. Robert Fripp, of King Crimson fame, once said, "Music is the wine that fills the cup of silence." Although he might want to revise that in a couple of minutes. And, yes, for the avoidance of doubt, I hate Tom, all right? ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ With the whole band playing together, it's actually quite a lovely sound. So I joined in. I'm not sure the crowd are into this. I'm not sure my bandmates are, either. [crowd clapping] [James] Bravissimo, bravissimo. [James] Bravissimo. Grazie, signore. - Grazie, grazie. - [applause] - So, Pippo? - Yeah? How am I at ciaramedda? [speaking Italian] "This is the best ciaramedda playing I have ever heard in the whole of Sicily." - [laughter] - I translate. [speaking Italian] He says bravo to me for my efforts. And I will be leader of the band within the next six months. [speaking Italian] "I feel sick listening to you play the ciaramedda." - [speaks Italian] - Goodbye and don't ever come back. - [laughs] Okay. - Cut. ♪ ♪ There's a bit of a pattern developing to this show which is that I go and attempt to do something, and then afterwards you join me in the car, we're alone, and I apologize for having attempted to do it. I did love Pippo's workshop. The bits of film we made with me talking to Pippo and Pippo demonstrating his lathe and his tools, that's all gonna go in the bit in the edit and Tom the director will put some cheap library music over some slow motion shots of sawdust flying about, that's it. In fact, it's already happened, hasn't it? I should probably call a truce on the ongoing battle with Tom and the producers, or they'll make me do something else ridiculous, like traditional Sicilian child throwing, or polo in canoes. Canoe polo is something I've never even heard of, to be honest, and as far as I can make out, it's like polo, but you play it in canoes. [whistle blows] The rules to canoe polo, as shown by the nail-biting European championships, are like basketball, only with greater risk of drowning. Each team of five passes the ball by chucking it. You can't hold onto the ball for more than five seconds, or you hear a sound - like this. - [whistle blows] Also there's no running, jumping, ducking, bombing or inflatables. The team with the most goals wins. So today, I'm joining the European champions - to give their opponents a sporting chance. - [whistle blows] - [James] And they are under 21. - [instructor] Yes. - [James] These are all women's teams? - [instructor] Yeah. Okay, you know I'm not a woman? No. [laughs] [James] Cue the obligatory costume change... ...into something designed for a teenage girl who doesn't have to worry about certain effects of the cold. I hope the helmet's big enough. Tom has arranged this to humiliate me, sì? - [Tom] Sì. - Sì, good. [both speaking Italian] - [James] Scusi. - [instructor] No problem. So this is like a tutu? Yeah. [laughs] - Oh, sorry, can I? - Yes, of course. Right, this way. Which is the front? Right, let's get this over with. Now, because we're nearing the end of the film, and time is of the essence... - [whistle blows] - here are my best bits. ♪ ♪ It won't go straight, Tom. There's something wrong with it. Where is the ball? It's hard to believe from what you can see here, but there's actually a match going on around me. Bollocks. Not that it will come as any surprise, nor will anyone even care... Ah! Ah! I'm going backwards. ...but my team lost. Ah! [laughs] [whistle blowing] Honestly, it's so exhausting and they're all 21. - [groans] - Yeah, I expected he could have done much better than this, yeah. [applause] [James] Can I just explain how this show works. When we say, like, we went to Japan previously, this time we decided to come to Italy, and I said I would like to... there's lots of art things I wanted to see, I wanted to help restore a mosaic, I wanted to do a bit about cooking, I wanted to go to the Campagnolo bicycle components factory, which I know you would have loved. To that, they then add the things they think it would be funny for me to do: snowball fighting, canoeing. The program is Our Man In Italy and at the beginning it says "James May," so I actually, ultimately say what we do and we're going to a café for an exchange of gifts and a doppio espresso and maybe un bicchieri vino bianco. - Sì? - Sì. That's much more interesting, isn't it, than watching a twat flap about in a canoe. Consider yourselves told, crew. ♪ ♪ The doppio espresso merely delayed the inevitable, an awkward goodbye. - I have a gift for you. - [James] A gift? - Yeah, un regalo. - Un regalo, ooh. Beautifully wrapped. Yeah, I did it. - It's a board game. - Yeah. It's a board game about Sicily. Should we play it? To see if you know enough about Sicily. There, that's nice, so there's Palermo, where we were, where we went in the square where the nuns had destroyed everything and - chopped the man's penis off. - [Claudia laughs] [James] Such a generous offering deserves something of equal magnitude in return. Great deal of thought has gone into this. Grazie. Oh. Very personal. And very heartfelt. - It's your coppola. - Sì. - Do I have to wear it? - Yes. I think it looks better on you than me. Let's just get the opinion of the crew. - No, I don't think so. - [crew member] Sì. - Sì? - [crew member] It's because she's Italian. Grazie, James, molto gentile. That's okay.

Seriously, it's been absolutely fabulous and I don't want this to be emotional because we're on television and it will look inappropriate, so I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna go. - Okay, grazie. - All right. - Grazie. - Sicily. Bye, bye. Oh, dear.
