PRETTY BUT POOR Oy Oy Oy! How they hurt! Still not here. What can they be doing? Will you stop following us? Yes or no? -Nooo! Oh God Annamaria, my stocking is loose. You had to put them on for the first time today? And you put on heels that you can't walk in! You want to go out? I'm not going out with you any more. Let's go. They don't care about us. No. I want to see who they're meeting, so I can tell Romolo and Salvatore. You'll see what a beating the brothers give them. Fine. Don't go. Instead you'll get the beating. Because in fact we're meeting them! Look, there they are. VIVA LAZIO! Let's scram before they hit us! Hi beautiful! Where's the wind blowing from? - From there! You can smell the sea. - It's your greasy thumb you smell! What'd you say about my thumb? So should we go to Cassia or Flaminia? Better you go to the nut house! See you later guys! - Bye! We've been waiting a half hour. - Excuse me, but we started out late! We rode in their car to get here on time. But there was no wind. So what could we do? Hey, I'm tired. We've been walking for two hours. We're stopping here, okay? Okay but not behind the bushes. I want to see you! Forget about your brother. Let's sit here in the shade. That sun sure is strong. Let's sit here in the shade. So Salvatore... what did you want to tell me? Nothing... except that a guy like me after all those flings, gets tired of those kinds of women. You've had a lot of affairs? How many? I never counted. Many. But you reach a certain point where you need to find something pure. Stop with the "pure!" I don't want to be treated like a little girl. But that's what you are... a little girl. Until yesterday you were playing in the yard. Come here... No, I'm ticklish. Tell me Romolo... Is it true that guys your age like older women? Stop that. Why do you ask? I always imagine you're getting bored with me. That's what you think. Come here, silly. Anyway, you need kissing lessons. You know this is the first time we're alone. That's true. Excuse me for asking, but when you went out with those girls did you kiss them right away or after a few days? Me? Right away! There's no time to even say hello before pow! You're so eager. - Eager beaver! And quick as lightning! I remember this one girl Anita Baldini from Treviso. Look at that. They think they're alone! Get a room! Now where exactly are Romolo and my sister? Wait a sec. Oh! They've disappeared! Were they talking about you? What were you doing with my sister? You! What were you doing? Me? We were talking. About what? - Lots of things. You want it in writing? Okay. In that case... Annamaria! Marissa! Home! C'mon! - C'mon! Move! - Take it easy! Take it easy! My shoe! - You can put it on at home! Porter! Whazzat? Someone calling me? Yes. Someone read the "Be Right Back" sign. That's okay. I put it up two days ago. You're really sweating, Pop. It's hot. Hot, yes. What are you doing? Take this. Thank you son, thank you. Sleep sleep. Set a good example for the kids. So, how much for this coat? Your father's an officer? - No, he's a porter. If you reverse the buttons they'll look like new. You see these seams? They've been stitched up plenty. I can give you 4000 lira. 4000 lira! It's a joke. Hows it look? Let me see... Yes, it's perfect. Goodbye. You sold Papa's uniform? What's the big deal? I sell in November and in summer I buy it back. Good-for-nothing! I've been waiting half an hour for you! What do you mean you'll "Be right back?" Whaddya want? Who do you think you are? I've never seen you before! Aren't you the porter? The porter! Can't you see I'm an officer? In which army? Signora Ceci. It can't continue like this. How is it that every day when I finish work dead tired I have to wait for him to get up from my bed. No. It can't continue! You'll see. I'll stop paying you the 10,000 lira rent. Not a penny. So this is what we'll do. I rigged up this little switch and afterwards he'll go flying out of bed. But what if he's really sick? I should take him to a specialist. Great. Take him to a psychiatrist. What do you say? Nothing. I want to see if that thing wakes him. Get off! A deadly snore. He sounds like a jet plane. He's liable to break the sound barrier. Damn! What happened to the switch? You hit the bullseye! Right in his mouth! Hey... we can't turn it on without the switch. We just have to wait. Come on Romolo, wake him. Or we'll never get to the beach. He'll kill me. Who's he gonna kill? Shall we try a little shock treatment? No! - You can't! At most his ears will get singed. He's already deaf. Go on! Ready... Aim... Contact! Salvatore, we gave you electroshock! Come on. You'll be wide awake today. What did they do to you Salvatore my beautiful boy! What's so funny? Is this a joke? C'mere Gigi. Explain something. Why are they always together? Simple... my sister goes out with Romolo, and my brother with Marissa. Poor them. The nerve of it. That's not the way to do it, I say! Not everyone lives like you. You work all night. You sleep all day. When do you make time for love? Make time? Get outta here!! You see how it is with these kids? Hopeless. It's the movies that corrupts them. Grab that one! One. Two. Three. Stupid jerks! Oh! Look at that one! Yeah yeah, do it to that one! Sandra, catch! Oh God, I've lost my top! Excuse me Miss, did you lose something? Are you looking for this perhaps? Give that back to me right now! Yeah, tomorrow. - You'll have to come out. You don't wanna soak all night. In the morning they change the water. I'll tell my boyfriend! I'm shaking with fear! What's his name? Adam. ADAM! ADAM! Adam! She's looking for you. - Have you seen Adam? Tell me, has Romolo kissed you yet? - Yes. And Salvatore? - No, that's what I'm afraid of. Without a kiss how do I know if he really loves me? He should have kissed you by now. Like this you can't even break up. You're telling me? Salvatore has kissed plenty of girls and still breaks up with them. That's true. I'm sorry, I have to smack you. - No Adam, give it some thought. I have to smack you. - Don't get upset. Who told you it was us? It doesn't matter, I have to smack you. Let's go Adam, don't bother with them. Shut up you. I have to smack them. Well said Adam. - What a beautiful little chain. Hands off, it's from mama. - Smile Adam. Don't be sore. Cheer up. Let's shake hands as a sign of good faith. Go on. At least think about it for a minute. Sorry but I'm not stupid. I have to smack you anyway. What's that guy doing? He thinks he can go around with his ass hanging out. What's that? Look at him. Shameful, no? Hey, what's going on here? Yes Adam, what's going on? Adam, stop acting like a fool. I'll get you for this! Sure you will. You'll get us another day. - You can thank me. I saved you Like hell you did. He had thick shoulders, eh? Shut up. He was so thick he almost killed you by mistake. Hey, who's gonna help me with those two? Count me in. Beautiful! Should I do it? - What are you waiting for? Watch out for angry boyfriends! Now where have they gone? - I don't see them. Oh there they are. You jerk! What are you doing? What are you doing to my sister! She's his sister! She's your sister too? Not my sister, my girlfriend! Your girlfriend? - You never mentioned her. This calls for a drink! The first drink's on him! What are you saying? Speak louder. I'm a little deaf. What do you mean? I'm just chewing gum from America! What? Before the girls come I have to tell you... You announced that my sister was your girlfriend. So? Whaddya mean "so?" You said it in front of everyone. It could ruin her reputation. Someone else, fine! But everyone knows what you're like. We love each other! So bring the priest and come to my house for a talk. Talk to your father? He's not even awake! You'll talk to me. We already talked! What do you want? Quiet. They're coming. In the meantime you don't touch my sister. Understand? Romolo. Shall we go? Isn't it strange Annamaria? How much we love each other. We'll be together the rest of our lives. From the first day to the last. Isn't it beautiful? I saw you born and I'll see you die. I'm younger so I'll get to watch you die. You know... I'm making a solemn pledge. Really? With who? - With you. It's news to me. - Tonight I'll speak to your mother. Really? Talk to my mother without knowing what I think? What you think doesn't count. You're just a kid. You know what I want to do when I get older? When you're older? Okay, tell me. I want to be a naval officer who when the boat sinks, stands on deck like this. Because the captain is everything on a ship. He's the heart of the ship. Why do you always talk like that? Talk like what? Always saying "I'd do this. I'd do that." Always something impossible... Never something that might come true with just a little effort. Like I said, I dream with my eyes open. No! You're the kind that can't hold onto anything. Before you said I was your girlfriend. Did that bother you? Yes! Because it's not true. You haven't even kissed me yet. What a fool! Stupid me. I forgot. You mustn't look at me like that. I get embarrassed. Like I said, I dream with my eyes open. Marissa! Annamaria! You know you're a good looking guy. Really? You should see me in uniform. An officer? - No... streetcar conductor. I should never come to engagement parties. They fill me with great sadness. I feel..like my life has no purpose. I need to find the right woman. But a woman who understands me. Now where can I find her? What are you doing tonight? Don Alvaro! Come join us. We're all alone here. Let's go or who knows what they'll think. We've been waiting for you. Don't wander away. Have a seat. A... bit of grapes? - Thanks. So... she wants you? - Quiet. Good? - Yes. It's been a while since I saw your son. A strapping boy! I can't complain. But I'll get more joy from my future son-in-law. See? My boy's got it all backwards. He doesn't want to move out. He's very sensitive, poor boy. Stop picking your nose... Salvatore! I was thinking, if the bride dresses in white, what do I wear? That's easy. A dark suit. Not true. I read that when the bride wears a long gown the groom wears stripes and a bowler hat. I'll supply the bowler hat. Or maybe a German helmet. Romolo! And instead of striped pants you can wear pajamas. When can we go? You promised to take us for a ride. You must have heard wrong. Cut it out! Salvatore! They finished playing bocce! Let's go over. Stay here. You can toast the winner. Do you like Salvatore's ring? It's pretty. And valuable. It was my mother's. I wish I had a ring. Or at least something that says we're engaged. You know, being engaged makes me feel funny... like a wilting flower. "A wilting flower..." You don't want to marry my sister? I'm fine with marrying your sister. But I'll hate being your brother in law. What's going on there? Let's go see. - Let's go. Franco. Franco. Where are you? Franco! Where are you? No! That's Commander Arezanno. An easy guess. He's bald! Nope. That's not Franco. No it's not Franco. But getting close. Higher! This one has hair, eh? He knows how to do it! - Do you need a straw? He sure is thirsty! Young man, that's enough now. Are you enjoying yourself? - It's a game. Franco... that wasn't you? - No! Romolo! Salvatore! Giovanna! Gimme a kiss. Gimme a kiss. Gimme a kiss. Looking good! - Enough! Giovanna, since you guys are so close, why not introduce us. This is Romolo and this is Salvatore. The ex boyfriends? - Yes. Like they say, ghosts from the past. A pleasure. A pleasure. What good guys. Not at all how Giovanna described you. C'mon guys. The chicken's done! Let's eat! Giovanna, who is this guy? He's Franco, my future husband. Don't even joke. I love you, but I'm not marrying you. I'm not marrying you! Relax. I'll marry you! And you'll arrive at the church dressed like a penguin. Now you're being wicked. - No... See you guys. I'm going to eat. - Bye. Now where's my seat? Over there! Giovanna! That guy must be loaded for you to marry him. He is. But I don't love him only for his money. How did he get so rich? Did he steal It? Are you crazy? He started with a jewellery store. Then opened a few more. He's in good shape financially. Better than us? Better than you would't be hard. How did you get to know him? I was looking for work and ended up at his store. And he hired you. - I'm not surprised. He's no fool. And the other one, you know the boyfriend.. The cutter. What happened to him? Who? Hugo? - Yes. Oh, we split up. Hugo got cut out of the picture. The chicken's getting cold. Boys I have to go. See you. - Bye. Come on Giovanna! - Aren't you eating? A ripe peach. - That's one beautiful girl. Romolo! Salvatore! - Don Alvaro is making a toast. You're my sister's fiancé! - What about you? Wipe that lipstick off. - You too. Let's go. What's so funny? Nothing. But it's ironic. Why? I don't understand what you see in those two. Then you must wonder what I see in you.. If I may... Why don't you wear a napkin? Oh, he talks big but he's just like the rest. He doesn't like me showing cleavage. Not at all. It makes others feel uncomfortable. They don't know where to look. Eyes to yourself. Put this on so you don't dirty yourself. Look Franco, when I'm your wife I'll do the buttons up to my neck, I'll wear long sleeves, sunglasses, whatever you want. Can't you understand that I'm still immature? I'm a guy! He's a guy! Giovanna, he's looking for permission. He likes his adventures and his freedom. Of course. Giovanna's so selfish. When will you show me some true love? That show can wait until after the wedding. Bravo Giovanna! Signora Laura, shall we slip away and do something crazy? Franco, how can you say such a thing in front of my husband? Your husband wouldn't want you to keep such secrets. Thank you Franco. Don't mention it. And what are you doing? Can't you see? I took off my napkin. I told you already I'm no good with speeches. In any case, a toast to this lovely couple on their engagement. And not just any couple. But a couple to end all couples. Bravo. He speaks so well. - Yes. Folks, these two were made for each other. And they can consider themselves lucky, because honestly guys, if they hadn't found each other, who else would have them? What did you say? Warn me before you give your next speech. In any case I toast to the happiness of this future couple. Hey, what about us? Don't interrupt me. Allow me to speak about happiness, because I have doubts about all your future happiness. What do you mean? I mean how will you even feed these poor girls? That's none of your business! - It's the truth! Butt out! - Who asked you? Keep acting like this we can sell tickets. C'mon. Useless! Ignorant! You know, he's right. I must have been crazy, to allow my that rascal to have any part of my daughter. That's right! She thinks she'll have the good life if she marries that loafer. What do you mean loafer? I mean... loafer! This is one fine mess, no? - Well, yes! Did you hear your father? - Well, he's right. If you get married you can't be lazy for the rest of your life. And what about you? This isn't the time to fight. Salvatore will find work. Who me? - Yes. Yes, you! Find work or you can forget about Marissa. She doesn't leave the house... at least until you show me a paycheque. Okay. And you'll only get to see my sister in photos. Until you show me yours. Okay? Fine! So we're agreed. You don't go out with my sister and I don't go out with yours. Until I find work. Agreed. Yes... but when will you find work? I already put an ad in the paper. Wait, I have it here. A clean-cut young man... religious... willing to do anything... available to work for a company... as a director. As a director. What could you direct? Traffic? At least you could do that. Who are you looking at? Why? You were doing this with your head. No, I have a tic. Sometimes I have a tic... nerves. Now he has a tic. - A tic! Going out? Where to? Shopping. I need a pair of stockings. And who gave you money? Mama. Are you finished the interrogation? No. I don't understand what you're doing... putting the egg custard Mama prepared on your face. What are you up to? - Me? Not a thing. Is it wrong to want soft skin? You and your soft skin are not to talk to anyone on the street. Especially anyone I know. Anyone I know! Understand? Okay. I understand. Annamaria... Listen, with the money that mom gave you, buy me a pair of socks. But yellow ones. - Okay. Yellow! - Okay fine! Kids... C'mere. You wanna make ten lira? Show us the money. Huh, you don't trust me. Follow Annamaria and see who she meets up with. Hurry up! She just left! Wait a minute. The money. You'll get it later. Better now. Okay. Go! Go! Hurry! You'll be less exhausted if you let me catch you. I told you I'm going out! - And I told you no! Fine then. I won't go. Is that so? Changed your mind? Happy now? Don't start if you know what's good for you. Now I'm going out. And no more mischief, eh? Aha! Caught in the act! Think you can put one over on me? Let's go! - Hands off! Papa! Hands off! - I'll show you Papa! Now let's see you go out. Open up! What's all the racket? After lunch I need my nap. Some lunch, it's after 6:00. You're counting the hours I sleep? For that you'd need an accountant. Open up Romolo! Open up! Looking good. Marissa! Marissa, I see Romolo's gone out. Let's wait a few minutes and then we'll go out. Salvatore, he locked me in. He locked you in? - Yes. What a good for nothing. I'll hop over and keep you company. No Salvatore no! I beg you! It's easy. Listen kids. You want to go to the movies? I'll give you 50 lira. We'd rather go with you. Maybe if you give us 100. I'll see you at home. Go on. Run! Romolo. See? She has a date with Romolo. Let's follow them. We'll get money from him too. Careful! As a kid I did this all the time. Please Salvatore, you'll hurt yourself. Oh God! Oh God, Salavatore! You see, I did it. What a fright you gave me! You thought I was dead? Are you sure your dad's sleeping? Yes. What'll we do cooped up here? What'll we do? Let's dance! Marissa. - Yes. Close your eyes. Why? Because I want to take you on a journey. In fact I want to take you on a honeymoon. A honeymoon few can imagine. Do you know where we are now? Where, Salvatore? On Monte Carlo Beach. Do you see all the lights? What lights? No. With your eyes open you can't see them. Close your eyes, close them. The millionaire's yachts are in the harbour. Oh God. Papa's waking up. No. That's Ali Khan's yacht raising anchor. Salvatore, I love you. Don't look now but Prince Ranier and Grace Kelly just walked in. But I don't feel like greeting them. Would you like a glass of champagne? Yes. Shall I call the headwaiter? Headwaiter! Headwaiter! Hey Porter! Hurry up with that! I don't wanna spend the rest of my life waiting for you! How beautiful! Imagine having a house like this. Who is this one? - This one? This one's Ulysses. Can't you see he look like Kirk Douglas? That's true. And this one? This one's... This one I saw in the newsreels. What's his name?...David! You know a lot. I told you we needed to come to the museum. Where can you find a better place to make love? Look there! And here we have the well known piece, "Two Kissing in a Museum." Does it say that painting over there is a Pecorino? Parmigianino! Come here. There's no one around. Give me a kiss. This one's David, no? Romolo, why don't we look for a guide? At least we'd learn something. Why? Do you need a guide to give me a kiss? No no no! That's not allowed. My God. Here too? What are you two doing here? Give us 200 lira or we'll tell Salvatore. You better give it to them. Oh, there you are! Now I've got you. Are these kids yours? Why? 'Cause they didn't buy a ticket. Either they pay or I throw them out. We'll take them. - Go! You good for nothings. You'll pay for this! Romolo, don't hurt them! - Outside! Rut me down! Rut me down! When did your brother have this suit made? It's new. Never been worn. Amazing that anything I try on looks twice as good, eh? Careful. Make sure your hands are clean. Romolo's back! Hurry up! Jump! You want me to end up on the sidewalk? Then hide! Do something! Come on! Hurry! Ow! My head! Now you can go out. What are you waiting for? Go on. What now? If you step out I'll clean the room. Get lost. I'm in no mood for jokes today. You're going to bed? - I've got nothing better to do. You're not eating? - I'll eat in bed. Bring me some dinner later. And my shoes need a cleaning. - I'll get them. What now? You want to go out? Do you want to go out or not? Ohh, dammit! What I need is peace and quiet! Mama, I'll cover the soup for Salvatore or it'll get cold. I'm starting to think maybe something's happened to him? What could possibly happen? No one can put up with him. That's a fact. It's already late. That means he already ate out. I'll eat his soup so it doesn't get thrown out. Hey no! He'll be home soon! Relax, he's not coming home soon. You. Bedtime. Let's go. His bedtime and I'm just getting up. What a joke. What is this stuff? It's like glue. It doesn't even look appetizing. Really disgusting. Here, get rid of it. Leave the apple. I'll eat it tomorrow. Go. I want to sleep. I'm so hungry. I'll eat the apple. Oh! We have mice? Hello Romolo. What are you doing here? - Nothing. Come out. We'll talk tomorrow. Let's sleep now. You good-for-nothing. Get out of there. "We'll talk tomorrow," I'll give you "tomorrow!" Out of there! Get out! - Okay, I'm going! Move it! Look what you did! It's a new jacket! Why should I care? It's yours. - It's mine!! Dear boy, you don't know how to do anything. What kinda work you looking for? He can start now. He's intelligent. - I can see that. - Don Memmo is a friend of mine. I said you'd give him a job. Okay, you wanna work on the stage? - As what? What else, as a dancer in the chorus. A hotshot like you could start right away. Come on Salvatore. I could watch you every night with a telescope. You'd look so good in tights. Otherwise they need nude models on Margutta Street. Interested? What do they pay? - 500 liras. That's not enough. You should take a walk. - Why? Come on let's go. We'll find some serious work. Hold on. What do you want? Don't I know you two? - No, you're mistaken. I've seen you before. Ah! Maybe at the university, eh? Bye. I'm not ashamed to say I'm unemployed. I looked. I didn't find any. So you've given up trying? I know why we can't find work. Because we don't know how to do anything. Here! See that? One can learn. We can study and learn a trade. If the image is unstable and intermittent, you must regulate with care the sealed controls for the horizontal and vertical. If during the transmission you hear a buzzing, and you can't establish whether it is a result of insufficient filtering... of the high voltage, or perhaps a modulation buzz. What do you do? Hey! What do you do? What do you do? Beats me. - You. You short out the antenna input and change the channel. Very good! Bravo! Quiet! You! To the blackboard. - Me? -Yes you. Draw me the shape of the wave... when it exits the amplifier. Attention! At ease. Stop fooling around. Remember why you're here. Listen to the teacher! - Okay... Is that okay? - It's missing something. What's missing? Who knows? -I do. - Come up. He knows everything. He's another Marconi? No he's a friend of mine. - Oh a friend of yours? Hey! Wake up! The low frequency condenser was missing. You heard my friend? - He's amazing! Quiet! Let's move on to the practical portion. - Yes professor. This is the apparatus? - Yes. Look closely at the pieces. Put them in their proper place. Can we blindfold him? - Yes. Oh Fabbiano! You should be able to correctly fit all the pieces with your eyes closed. None of you fellows help him. I'm going out for a cigarette. Don't help him. Not even a clue. Get back! - You can see. Oh! Someone swiped the condensor! Never mind. Here it is. And the valve? Where's the valve? Guys, the valve! Put back the valve. Must be Salvatore. No one else could be such an imbecile. Romolo, thanks for the pear juice. All done? - All ready professor. Plug it in. - Plug it in. C'mon. Outside! Out! Outside! Get out of the class! Outside, now! It's funny isn't it, like dating someone from school. With these two it's more like dating children from grade school. I guess we should be happy, they're trying to do something serious. Idiot! Moron! - Get your hands off me! Salvatore! What happened? Because of him they threw us out! It was a joke! - Joke? You idiot! Didn't we go to school to learn a trade? You know what? I'm not going to school. I've already wasted too much time. I'll get a job doing whatever. Okay? What kind of work? As a chorus girl? Even to be a chorus girl you have to know something! Salvatore! - And where are you going? Let's go. It's just you and Marconi. - You're always fighting. What now? How about a movie? Let's hit the street like we always do. Not again. It's always the same. Okay, that's it. Good night. See you. Bye. Salvatore! C'mere Salvatore! - What a car! What's up? Get in and don't ask questions. We're on our way to a party. Who's party? - Come on. It's a treasure hunt. See all this stuff? What does that have to do with me? - What do mean with you? You're part of the game. Get in. We'll win the treasure hunt for sure. We've got the rarest piece. There he is. Come on Salvatore, squeeze in. - That's better. Why not put on the shawl. You'll catch cold. How annoying you are. I'm not cold. Are you hot Salvatore? Are you hot? - No. You see? He's not hot. - Clearly. Quiet please folks. Here we are. We even found a sheep. Just a second please, just a second. The Belardinellis are on top with 50 points. But they're still short the radio and the Saint Bernard dog. We're here! Here we go. Another couple has arrived. Very good. Excellent. We found absolutely everything. Even the ex boyfriend? Where is he? Right here. Salvatore, let them see you. Smile. Be happy. What's the matter? You're angry at us? I get it. This is why you wanted me. Very funny. Thank you. Giovanna. Is this your ex-boyfriend? - Yes. We've already met. A pleasure. - A pleasure. Look at my wife's ex. How ugly he is. For sure. You can't even compare him to my ex.. Let's go Giovanna. Say, should we ask them to play our song? Sure. Maestro! Maestro! Play "Love Me" by Titta and Chiacchi. Thanks. Franco! Look it's Ms.Laura! Oh Darling, how are you? - Well, and you? What do you say? Shall we go off and do something crazy? Why not? My husband will be away for a week. Giovanna. I'm stealing Franco. Do you mind? If it's to dance with you go right ahead. Thank you. - You're welcome. Excuse me Giovanna. Giovanna, you let her steal Franco? And they're dancing to your song. I don't care. I found something better. Ah, is the past returning? - Nope. The past is leaving. Bye Giovanna. Salvatore wait. Won't you ask me to dance? Look folks. The Saint Bernard. Wonderful. Well done Madame. Very good. The Belardinellis have won the treasure hunt. Look how you're dancing Salvatore. Hold me tighter. You won't hurt yourself. Giovanna... What'll you do if you fall in love with me like the last time? Who knows? Anything could happen. You know you're better than him. - Come on. Seriously, you're more of a man. - Really? You know I really like you. You're really starting to grow on me. I'd jump at the chance to get back together. Salvatore let's get out of here. I don't feel like dancing any more. No more dancing? - No. Ms. Laura you must.. You must say "yes" right now, otherwise... Right now is not possible. My husband just left and it would feel like a betrayal. Tomorrow. Tomorrow? - Yes. Hey look. May I? Of course. That's good ice cream. What flavour is it? Melon. I'll take some to Giovanna. A bit of this and she'll swoon. Laura are you free? - Yes. Shall we dance? - Giovanna! I don't have money because material things don't interest me. You know as a child I played the violin. How silly you are Salvatore. I remember the teacher said, "You'll never be good because you have fingers like shovels." "But you do have certain skills." Because the violin isn't like other instruments. The violin has a soul. It cries. It laughs. Yes, wouldn't that be nice. I'm in a box at the opera and you're on the stage in a tux playing "Flight of the Bumblebee." And the crowds are cheering "Bravo! Encore!" Giovanna. Never. Salvatore, would you like to give me a kiss? You have to ask? - Go ahead, give me one. Am I interrupting? Come on... I want you to try this melon ice cream. Keep your hands to yourself. Want some? - Me? Come on, I have something to tell you. Bye Salvatore! See you later. Call me. This melon ice cream is really good! - You like it? Draw me the evolution of a square wave. Well done. Back to your seat. Well done Marconi. Well done! Now you. Go on. - Not me. He was talking to you. - To me? Yes you. Draw me... Draw me a constant wavelength. A constant wavelength. I'll give it a try. Pop, did you see how I did the calculation? Really wonderful. Well done. Look Pop I wanted you to come and see that I could learn a trade. But I'll need some help. What kind of help? - The money kind. I found a small shop nearby. It's a sure thing. Pop, leave your job as a porter, give me your pension money, and I'll look after you for the rest of your life. At your age you should take it easy, no? Yes of course, but I wasn't expecting this. You think I can retire? - Quiet! Listen to me Pop. - Romolo, I have to tell you... They already gave me my pension in advance and I spent it all. What do you mean? I keep working 'cause I owe them money. If not they'd have thrown me out. Pop, tell me it's not true! Easy! Maestro, help us out here. You. To the blackboard. - Me? No you. To the blackboard. Your turn Pops! Don't get so friendly! Tell me, when you see a long wave what do you do? A big wave? - A big wave. I try to keep afloat. Who are you? In fact I'm not your student. I'm only here to watch. Then go be funny somewhere else. Start walking. Get out. Romolo. How are you? - Good, you? Fine. Have you seen Pop? He just left. He was laughing. He's laughing now? - And Salvatore? He didn't come again today. How did it go? - It went okay. Okay, I better get going. Come along with us. - What for? To chaperone? No Marissa, come on I want to show you something. I found a shop that would be perfect for Romolo. It's a few steps away. C'mon. HALF STORE FOR RENT For royalty it's small but it'll still fit a customer or two. Look Marissa. The shop would fit here and the upholsterer would be behind it. Yes, but it'll need 2 to 3 hundred thousand lira to open. And who's gonna give me that? - Romolo. The ring Salvatore gave Marissa. How much could you get for that? Of course! Great idea! Marissa, why don't you give me the ring? Come on, I know a jeweler. I'll have it appraised and then pawn it. It doesn't look like she wants to give it. She's afraid Salvatore will be angry. - Angry? Fine take it. I hope he gets angry. That lazy good for nothing. Marissa! No Marissa's right. This month I can afford to buy books instead of asking Pop. Now Salvatore will have to earn his keep. Yes indeed, from now on Salvatore works. I watched it. I watched your car, eh? Thanks. Good night. Thanks. Bye beautiful. 10 Lira! What a cheapskate! Hope you crash! I knew it! What a psychic I am. Good evening. Look kid, I'm leaving it unlocked while we pop into the restaurant. Don't worry, I'll look after it. Salvatore. - Giovanna. Hi. Look, order for me as well. I'll be right in. Are you crazy? My friend invited me to dinner. How did it end with Franco the other night? That's why I called because I must talk to you. Actually it's Franco that wants to talk to you. With me? What for? Salvatore, he saw you give me a kiss. So what? Is he angry? I don't know. I only know he wants to talk to you. He's over there. - Over there? Yes, waiting by the car. - Let's go. Salvatore, I'll be brief. The other night you were kissing Giovanna. Kiss? A little peck. Whatever he gave me wasn't a real kiss. Fine. So? - So... Still you knew perfectly well Giovanna's my girl. Don't say that. It depends on how this conversation goes. I always like things to be clear. So that leaves us two possibilities. Either you're just looking for a casual affair, which means you're nothing but a scoundrel. Or... or you really love her. In which case I'll shut up because I respect your feelings. Gentlemen, shall I play a polonaise? Play a retreat. Can't you see we're talking! In the end if you really love her, I'll step down. Then you'll do the right thing... and marry her. What? - You marry her. Nobody makes a monkey out of me. I'm grateful but... Excuse me Giovanna but I can't marry you. Because... I'm in love with a young girl named Marissa. Is that so? - Yes. You know her, right? Here little granny, here. Now go... go. Well Giovanna, that's a big load off my mind. I was afraid you'd fallen in love with this clown. What did you say? Sorry. Sorry that I had to slap you. Maybe next time you won't be such a scoundrel. Let's go Giovanna. Say goodbye. Salvatore, you should've told him we're getting married and saved yourself a slap. I would have refused anyway. All this an act to make him jealous? It worked well, no? I guess it did. Bye Salvatore. See you. - See you. It's no use laughing Franco. There'll be no kissing and making up. Not until you change. I'm changing. I'm changing into second gear. - Very funny. Good evening. I kept an eye on it, eh? Thanks. Come on. Plenty of room. Like that. No problem. Straighten up now.. Whoa! 100 lira. A real gentleman. My car... where's my Alpha? - Alpha? What Alpha? Hey! Hey! Stop thief! Stop thief! Is there a jewelery store around here? To be clear, at this time of day the police are on patrol. Who do you take me for? If we make a deal, I'll be your lookout. You can trust me. I'm a habitual criminal. Here's the store. Good day. Is Mr. Franco in? - Yes, why? He's a friend. I have a ring to appraise. Let's see. This was hiding in someone's raster egg. Why? What's it worth? Depends on the origin. Is it stolen? Whaddya mean stolen? Go get your boss!! No... yes. There's someone wants to value this ring. I'll be right out. Now you made me make a mistake. Giovanna, didn't we make up for good? Yes, but do you remember what you promised me? Me? Hand on my heart it's all I think of. You see? Because of you I wrote "estimate" with 2 S's. Better. More prestigious. - The guy's waiting. Look, it's Romolo. We can't get away from those two. No sooner do I get rid of one and the other turns up. It's certainly a nice big shop. Lots of expensive stuff. - You like it? -Very much. He has the face of a thief. Look Romolo, I want to help you. And I can see that the ring is unique. What can I say? I couldn't give you more than two million lira. That's what you give to the guy off the street. But for me you should give two and a half million. Can you believe it? He's always clowning around. Can't you see it's a fake? It's worth maybe 50 thousand lira? What're you up to Romolo? Are you giving us the runaround? I have no idea what it's worth. I needed 200 thousand lira to open a shop. Give me whatever you like. Come on Franco, be nice. After all, what's 200 thousand lira? Wait here... I'll go get it. Well done Giovanna. You're an angel. Romolo. Not less than 250 thousand, eh? Okay. I'll try. Hands to yourself! Look, this is nothing more than giving money to your old boyfriend. And I don't like it. Believe me Franco it's just for friendship. I'm sure Romolo really needs this money. Just to get started. Fine. Enough. I'll give him the money. Maybe it'll put an end to this coming and going of boyfriends. What do you want? Who do you take me for? Watch it. The police are on patrol. And you ask who I take you for? Here Romolo. The 200 thousand. I don't know how to thank you. No, there's no need. For me It was also a good day. Bye. - Bye. Good day Mr. Romolo. Take this. - Thanks. You see? I am a thief! Franco. - Yes? Give me your hand. - Here. No, the other one. What for? - I want to put this on your finger. Giovanna, what's going on in your head? You know I love you. I'd even marry you. But I'm not the marrying kind. How many times have I told you? Of course. Don't take it so serious... It was a joke. Anyway I don't love you Franco. Who would want you? Giovanna I... I love you. You know that. But marriage... Yes, you're right. What is marriage anyway? A bad business arrangement especially for men. Why would any man marry a woman? When you come home she might ask where you've been or not let you go out at all. Exactly Giovanna! That's what I was saying, see? Yes! 'Cause when you get married can you hang out with friends? Can you run off and play soccer? When you're married the good times are over, right? With a wife hanging around there's no more swearing and getting into fights. But Giovanna... two people that love each other.. Can live together also.. Without being husband and wife, no? No Franco. I can't. I should be able to ask the man I love where he's been. Goodbye. Giovanna. No, don't worry. We're still friends like before. And I'll make sure Romolo returns the money. So... what is this? Are you quitting? No. Why? You hired me and I need work. As long as you're not firing me. Then you can't leave yet. It's still 10 minutes to one. Where were we? "In response to your estimate..." - With just one S. "I should like to inform you that our manager Mister Pomella..." Hello. Who is this, Nando? No I can't go to the game on Sunday. What do I care that Lazio is playing! I'm not going! I'm not going! "The manager Mister Pomella.." What do I care about Mister Pomella! You should be happy. I have a stable decent job. As an inspector for City Hall. And along with my salary I get a free transit pass. A free transit pass? - Sure, to get to the places I inspect. And anywhere that's not up to code I issue a fine and take a percentage. Salvatore, I still don't understand what you do. I'll explain later. But first I have a surprise, eh? Wait two minutes, I'll be right back. Salvatore! You're still wearing the price tag. Oh, what a dope I am. What are you doing? - I have a little cough! Are you sick? It's a barking cough! Now I've got you. What do you want? Excuse me ma'am, is there a dog in the house? A dog? There's no dog. - I just heard him bark. You're mistaken young man. I just live here with my canary. - Your canary, eh? We'll see about that. Is that your canary? You have a dog and haven't paid the dog tax. I have to fill out a report and then check to see if it's an expensive dog. Come, Endimione, come.. mummy loves you. This here's Endimione. That's no lapdog. It'll cost you 2000 lira extra for not reporting him. Sure! I'm gonna pay 2000 lira! If you don't pay I'll have to take him away. I wish. Here... I can't stand to look at him. It's my husband who's stuck on him. Make him disappear before I have to claim him. Take him away! Good work. What's your name? Endimione. Let's go. Come on! Come on Endiminione. What's this? I had to take him. They wouldn't pay the fine. Oh, this is the respectable job? Dog catcher? - Not exactly. Congratulations! Marissa. Listen to me! Marissa, don't be so mean. No... Salvatore, we can't go on like this. With the jobs you find we'll never settle down. I'll have to find a serious job. I've been offered one in a store. No! I won't allow you to work. I'm going! I've already decided! Be reasonable Marissa. How can I send you out to work as a sales girl? If we're getting married then one of us needs a serious job. My work isn't serious? You don't have to shout! And I'm getting 30,000 lira a month! Well... I get 7000 a month. It's small but a nice setup. With a bit of money it could be a major store. You're making a mistake getting married. Romolo, what do you need that for? Good day. Good day miss. Would you like a radio or a tape recorder? Maybe a television? I'm looking for upholstery. - In the back! We need someone who can help us with a bit of capital. Or maybe... I should find another girl. A girl that's good with people, that could be of some help around here. Why are you looking? You've found Giovanna. She's a beautiful girl, she's got class. She lent you 200,000 lira without even a signature. And you..you hardly thanked her. I didn't thank her? Romolo, there's only one way you can thank a girl like that. If you get my meaning. Hello Giovanna. It's Romolo. Nothing much. I have a debt to settle with you. There's no hurry? I'll give back the money whenever you ask. You have a customer! 'Scuse me, I have a customer. We'll talk later. Bye. Okay guys, this is the shop. Beautiful. - Cheery. It looks like a mailbox. It starts small but it gets bigger! Romolo, I brought you some clients. You need to repair this. Why bother? This belongs in the trash. Are you kidding? It's a Telefunken! What's the problem? Too much static. We can't hear a thing. Okay, let's see. The interference sure is loud. I've never heard a radio like this. The electromagnet must be defective. Let's take a look. Jerks! Next time we'll take it to a veterinarian. You too Annamaria. Go home. Why? What did I do? I didn't know. It's better you don't come to the store. I have to work and I can't do it when you're here. Don't you understand? You're in the way. But I wanted to keep you company. I'd sit quietly while you work. I even brought the socks I was knitting. Yes, now I'm selling socks. Go on. Get out. Hello Giovanna. Sorry, it was an important client. Listen, why don't we get together? Unless of course you're busy with Franco. No... you're free? So let's go out tonight. I'll call you. Bye. Perticone! She said yes! You were right. But you should've been nicer to Annamaria. You saw how she looked. Perticone, listen to me. If you want to succeed in life, other people aren't important, understand? Look at this. Start dusting! I can't reach. Good day. Good day. - Good day. Radio? - No... upholsterer. In the back. Thank you. What beautiful gnocchi. Mmm, smells good! No I don't want any. Who made them? I made them. But Salvatore kneaded them. There's more in the kitchen. Salvatore, did you make this gnocchi? Yes, why? - Then I'm not eating any. You eat that gnocchi or tomorrow morning you go to school. Get started! Here it says, "Another accident on the Tiburtino Bridge." "A tram crashed into the 600 bus" What's with Maria today? That girl is starting to worry me. That's the third time this year it's happened and not once do the papers mention my name! What do the reporters have against me? What do I have to do to get my name in print? Kill someone? Damn, it's time for my pill. I better go take it. Salvatore, do you like your job? Salvatore! Who's that on our bed? He's looking at me with two eyes like this! Endimione. Endimione? And who's that? My dog. You brought a dog into this house? Mrs Ceci... Where does it say that the bed is for the use of Salvatore, for me, and now for "Emilione!" You know what I say? At the end of the month you can look for another tenant. Me..I'm outta here! You... out! Aiiiii... Stop biting! Let go! Annamaria. - What. What are you doing? - Crying. I'm crying too. But I feel silly crying. It's your brother's fault I'm crying. You know why? Why? What did my brother do? - He no longer wants me. He threw me out of the shop. He... he said I was bothering him. At least he's working. My Salvatore has no place to throw me out of. You know what he's doing? He barks at dogs behind closed doors. And then... then he tells me he's working. What are you doing? You're crying too? - We're so miserable. Marissa... pass me your hankie. Mine is all used. Take it. - Thank you. Oh, you're out here chatting? How is it I work all day, get home, and find everything's cold? Get into the kitchen! That's where a woman belongs. So now you're head of the family? It would seem so. Well then, tomorrow morning you can pay this electricity bill, otherwise they'll shut off our lights. Come on Miss. Speed it up. Try these on. Here..these are the moccasins you saw in the window. They feel okay? No... a little tight. I need a 44. Alright then, try these instead. So, you like them? - You decide Nunziata. You have to like them. - They're very nice, and you can wear them rain or shine. Let's get them. - Okay. You'll wear them? - Yes. I'll wrap up the old ones. 5000 lira. Good day and thank you. - Good day. Those should feel better. They're a 43 loose. That's a pretty dress. But I like the other one better. The one with the red flowers. How do you know about that? - I see you here every day. I have the shop in front. - The one with electronics? No. These don't work for me either. Try these. Actually... since we both go in the same direction, I'd like to walk you home some afternoon. Okay? The truth is... you know I... I get it. There's some poor guy who's waiting for you all day. No, you can see I need the 44. We don't have it in a 44. Try these. They're flexible! Um... do you have a boyfriend? We've known each other for many years. We grew up together. Well, I guess I'll just stick to mine. - I'm sorry. Where are they? - What? The shoes I was wearing. - Here they are. No, these aren't mine. Oh God! What a disaster! I gave them to the man who just left. What will my boss say. I'm here on a trial basis. Don't worry. It's nothing. It'll all work out. And there isn't a single 44 in the whole store. Fine. I'll go like this. I'm just across the way. Good day. Miss, what have you.. The young lady had nothing to do with it. I got distracted. I'll go home like this... without shoes. Bye bye. Mr. Franco what's the matter? It's been a week you're eating alone. Where's Miss Giovanna? - She went back to the ocean. Ah, back to the ocean. Good afternoon sir. Right this way. Should we sit somewhere else? - No, this is just fine. Say, couldn't we find a quieter spot? We're perfect right here. I'll order, okay? - Okay. Well now... Say something nice to me Romolo. How can I? You take my breathe away. Who does he think he is? - Why? It's her brother. Ah, her brother. I don't speak to him. We had a fight. Ah, you had a fight. Richie, do me a favour. Listen to what they're saying and tell me after. Giovanna... I don't have a clue what your plan is. I don't even want to know. Who can say Romolo? Lots of things could happen. Lots of things? Okay, what did they say? She ordered the spicy chicken. For her brother, the chick pea pasta. And she ordered a tossed salad. Are you being funny? A waiter is like a priest. What's said in private is sacred. So give me back the 1000 lira. Look Giovanna. Let's get out of here, and go look at the new shop. Our shop. No it's already late. And we haven't warned your family. Who cares? I'll call ahead. Get ready and we'll go. Oh Romolo, stop it. Go ahead and laugh. Mr. Franco, you're girlfriend's nuts! - Why? She's talking to herself. Talking to herself? What about him? Her brother went to use the phone. - Is that so? Take it. Hello Laura. Hello... It's Franco. So I'll be there in ten minutes. Bye. Imbecile. Shall we go? - Of course. What are you doing? Stealing phone tokens? I want to remember this night forever. Good night. - Good night. Giovanna, this was one of the best nights of my life. For me too Romolo. It was very nice. Thank you. But now I have a headache and I'm going home. You mean alone? - Yes, I'll take a taxi. No Giovanna, I'll go with you. At least until the front door. Romolo... don't ruin it all. I know you understand me. We'll see each soon. Bye. - Bye. Whatever you did, it didn't go well. - Bye. Try to figure women. Look Marissa, I don't want to date for the fun of it. I really like you. I don't know how to say this to you. The more I say... I don't want to be misunderstood. I want to marry you. I'm sure that with me you'd be happy. And Salvatore? What would he say? Who is Salvatore? That guy who came to pick you up again today? Yes. To you he doesn't matter. So he's your boyfriend. - Yes. I've wanted him since childhood. I waited a long time for him to notice me. And now that we're in love he disappoints me. I guess he's a good guy. Yes he's a good guy. But he has no ambition. He loves me... but if things continue like this, what kind of life can he offer me? Even if he loves me. Now you've come along to complicate things even more. I was scared the moment you said you'd fallen for me. And now what do I do? You're a nice friendly guy with a good job. Don't laugh. I'm not just thinking of money.. But a girl getting married wants a bit of security. A house, a peaceful life. I've always been poor, and I'd like a change. And if I were to have children, I don't want them to be the children of poor people. When babies are born they don't know anything. They don't know whether they'll be poor or rich, happy or unhappy. I'm impressed to hear that speech from a young girl like you. I don't want to force myself on anyone. But think about it. Promise me you'll think about it. I'll say it again. I want to marry you. Please... take me home. I don't know what I should do. Let's go. Bravo. For heaven's sake Romolo, what's going on? You say nothing. Not a word. There's nothing to say. Look over there. You have nothing to say to your sister, who's engaged and fools around with someone else? I already told her it was good. - Good how? That guy earns money and has a good job. Marissa would do well to leave Salvatore for him. Let's go for coffee. - I'm coming. Come on! Hurry up! - Coming! Will we see each other again? I don't know. Goodbye Julio. - Goodbye. Marissa. What's this I hear? You stay out of it. I see you're cheating on Salvatore. You found yourself a guy with a car while my poor brother who loves you Your brother doesn't deserve anything. He hasn't worked for 6 months. He's had bad luck. It's not his fault. Poor thing. It's nobody's fault. I see. You're getting a swelled head... just like Romolo. It's clear you two are from the same family. You mean different than yours. And I don't want to talk to you about it. You're a child and don't understand me. A child! That's how you talk to me? I regret being your friend. Fine! Once we were friends and now we're not. Endominione, keep quiet. Sorry I need to... Why do I need the hat? To even up the sideburns. Hang on... don't I look like a sailor? You look like a bus driver. Why didn't you become a barber? You have a light touch. Destiny. What's the matter? What happened? I had a fight with Marissa and now we're not friends. You guys'll make up. Why were you fighting? Because she "put the horns" on you if you must know. On me Marissa "put the horns?" Exactly you. With a guy that's got money. I saw her get out of his car. Salvatore, you've got horns now? Go hang yourself on your own horns! Bad manners! - Marissa! Excuse me. Have you got a lot more crying to do? Yes. It's just that I have to go to bed. Okay. Fine. What is it Salvatore? Nothing to say to me? Why? Did Annamaria tell you something? So it's true! Admit it! What? You "put the horns" on me. No Salvatore, I did not "put the horns" on you. I just noticed you're no longer wearing my ring. You took it off so that no one will know we're engaged, eh? Good job! Not true! It was too big. They're making it smaller. Isn't it true that some guy brought you home in his car? Yes it's true, but I didn't allow him to get familiar. I should hope not! And who is he? A decent man. A decent man who comes between a young girl and her fiance. And I trusted you... It's good that I know what you did. You make me regret that I was faithful. You're a childish gold digger! If I was I would have said yes! Said yes to what? He asked me to marry him. Is that so... Tell him yes! Don't make him wait! He's got a car and money. All the things you want, no? No you're wrong! That's not what I want. But maybe it's better like this. If you'd been more serious... What serious? Don't make excuses! And give me back my ring! Okay Salvatore. Goodbye. Is it really over? Yes. ~The sun is shining smiling down on love~ You heard? She found a rich one. I have to make some money, damn it! What can a poor person do? Do I have to start stealing? It's not easy Salvatore. To steal..you need a bit of a brain. Endiminione... be quiet. Maybe I can get some sleep. If it was Christmas, you could dress up as a nun and collect for me. I have to make serious money so that I can turn my life around. You think it's so easy? There is a way, but it's a bit risky. Risky in what sense? In the sense that if you're caught you won't be able to say it was legal. I'll do anything. - It's a delicate assignment, but not difficult. You have to take a package to the Piazza de Malva. How much does it pay? You'd be well paid. How much? How much? Two hundred thousand, okay? Two hundred thousand? Let's go! Okay then I'll give you half now and half later. You want? - Of course I want. Let's have it. Hey, what are you doing? Like I said, half now and half later. That way if you screw up or skip town you won't see a penny. This must be some kind of dirty work. Dirty work? You only have to take a package. Pigsty. Pigsty! What's up? This... This is the guy you'll be working with. He'll fill you in on the details. Now go. C'mon. Hello. Yes Romolo go ahead. What? Don't get mad Giovana but the ring wasn't mine and now I have to return it. I'd like it back. You know Salvatore left my sister. Besides, it'd be a good chance to see you again, eh? Come at 1:00 and we'll talk. At 1:00. Bye. Who was that, Miss? It wasn't for you. Young lady I've told you a thousand times, not to use the phone for personal calls. Close up! Hi. - Hi. Close up! Romolo. You didn't wait for me? Was I supposed to wait? Weren't we going to eat at the beach? I prepared everything. Even the frittata with pepperoni. Sorry, I forgot. In fact now I can't. I have something important to do. If two months before the wedding you've stopped thinking of me... imagine after. What are you saying? Anyway... Annamaria I want to tell you something.. Maybe... I was thinking we should get married a little later. That would suit me, whaddya say? No Romolo. You no longer care for me. When you started working... I was very happy. But it might have been better if you'd failed. Because now... you care only for money... and don't want to marry me anymore. And I don't understand why. Who says? Another year or two, what's the difference? No Romolo, we agreed to get married but not when you decide. I'd rather... stay single. Stay single then. Your loss. Aiii! You imbecile!! Whadd'ya say to me? I didn't say anything. Can you gimme a light? A big pain in the neck. Thanks. Marissa. What do you want? I'm in a hurry. Marissa, listen to me. If it's about Salvatore you're wasting your time. Just listen to me. Salvatore's on the road to ruin and it's your fault. He left this note. Really? And just out of curiosity what does it say? Dear Mama... If I decide to do something bad it's not because I'm bad. It's because I love Marissa. For her I've embarked on this road to perfectio... to perdition. And if it all ends badly and I don't come back... forgive me. Salvatore. And you believe him. Like the time he left that suicide note. No... this time it's for real. Look what I found in his drawer. All this money cut in half. That's what thieves do. Oh God! He's really not joking. Marissa we can't abandon him. Salvatore loves you so much. Only you can stop him from going down that road. Where is he? Where did he go? Wait... I heard him make a call to a bar on Corso Vittorio. Come on. Show me. Julio is waiting for me in the car. We can look for him together. Marissa. Does that mean you love him again? Hurry up! There's no time to lose. Young lady, I'm leaving at 1:00. Will you close up? Fine. Hi Giovana. Hi Romolo. Franco's not here? No, he's gone out. And that weird shop assistant? He's out too. - So you're all alone. Yes. Why Romolo? Now we can talk in private. I have lots to say to you. Here's your ring. Thanks. Giovana, you're a true friend. Without you I don't know what I would've done. It's the second time you've saved me. Don't mention it. I wanted to. What's the matter? Are you scared? What should I be scared of? Here we are alone for the first time. Knock it off. Giovana! What is it? Why do you think I helped you? Because I'm a nice normal guy, no? No Romolo. I did it because I considered you a friend. Nothing more. A good friend, understand? But I don't want to be just a friend. I want something more. That's it! Keep your hands to yourself. I'm sorry I helped you. Instead..instead I made it worse. That bit of money changed you. What money? What are you saying Giovana? You see how I like you. We're made for each other. Please! Leave me alone! Stop it! Say yes. There's a customer. - I'll throw them out. Romolo! It's 1:00. The shop closes at 1:00 right? Oh! They already closed the door. Rut me up against it. Hurry! I'm upside down you idiot. When I get outta here I'll fix you! Get out! Go home! You talkin' to me? No, only to the dog. Damn! Ten minutes earlier and they would've been open. They close precisely at 1:00. You want me to deliver it to them? No no. You can see it's stamped "fragile." I have to deliver it in person. Goodbye then. - Bye. It's raining? No. Just a couple of drops. Bad dog. Look what you've done. Get down from there. Go. You can start now. Okay. Endimione, get out of here. Romolo, get out of here now. Why? Because you're behaving like a scoundrel. What do you mean Giovana? A scoundrel because I want to kiss you? You see this? So? I'm married to Franco. Yes, I'm married. - Married! When? Um..a week ago. Why didn't you tell me? I wouldn't have made a fool of myself. Oh, that's what it takes for you to respect me? What's going on? Oh! They're cutting through the shutter! They're going to burn down the store! There he is! Stop, Julio! Salvatore, what are you doing here? Please answer me. None of your business. Fine, I'm not leaving until you tell me.. So what? Go back to your friends. Scram. That's Salvatore's voice! What are you up to? What's in the box? Salvatore, don't do this. We love you. If I tell you will you go? - Yes. I'm stealing, okay? Then I'll have a nice car too. Stealing? You're sitting here doing nothing. Says you. There's a guy in the box cutting a hole into the store. You dimwit! Whaddya sayin'? Who are ya talkin' to? Don't worry. It's just my sister. Keep going. Keep going?? Get rid of them! They're gonna ruin everything. What's with Salvatore? He's a thief now? And here of all places. I want to see his face when I... Salvatore! Go home. I'm free to do what I want. No. Come home with us! I'm going to the police! - Just try it! What's going on? What happened? What's all this fuss about? Step aside. So... Nobody's talking? What for? I'm not allowed to fight with my fiancé? Sure. As long as you don't hurt him. Have you all gone nuts? You want them to put me in jail? Back to work. He's gone. It's no use. I can't work like this. What's going on? What are they doing? Well... it's a robbery. - Oh. If anyone else shows up, we'll get a few chairs. So they won't have to stand, right? Listen, if you're doing this because of me then you should stop. Because I'm only a good friend. - Oh really? And you asked her to marry you when you knew she was engaged to me? Me? I asked her to marry me? She said that to make you jealous. Is that true? He didn't ask you to marry him? No. He didn't ask me. Well then, I'll be going now. Goodbye. Goodbye Marissa. And congratulations. Mister Julio. Mister Julio... What you did was so beautiful. If I wasn't in love with someone, I'd marry you myself. So... you still love me? I still love you, yes. And... and you'd come back to me even though I'm worthless? Look Salvatore... I just wanted you to become a man, so that you'd find serious work. But not for the money. Because I... because you and I together... would make me happy even if I was poor for the rest of my life. Dammit!! How can anyone work like this? Your sister has more sense than you. She understands that money can't buy happiness. Are you finished lecturing? Oh where are those thieves? I'm getting bored. You're sure you love me? - Yes. That you'll always love me? - Yes. For the rest of your life? - Yes. Swear on it! - I swear! What now? - Trust me. Be quiet. Why'd you close the box? - Hey you, c'mere. Open up! Open up! Help me lift this. Salvatore! What are you doing? - Leave it to me. Don't worry. Salvatore! Where are you going? You jerk! This weighs a ton! Wait. What have got inside there? We pinched a thief. So why don't you take him to the cops? I feel sorry for him. Hey, can you swim? What's that have to do with me? You? You're turning over a new leaf. Let's go. One... Two.. Blast off! HEEEEEELP!! Hey, was there really a guy in there? And what's it to you? - To me? Nothing. Hey, he can swim! He's saved. Yeah, but with this current he'll end up in Sardinia. Just look at what they did! Scoundrel. Have you no shame? Shame on you! If you were my son I'd kill you! That went badly, eh? - What are you laughing at? Look at that ugly face! It's the face of a thief! Go on. Scram! Oh, I know who you are. The joker from the pool. So? Now I'm going to smack you. - Maybe some other time! Thief! Thief! Thief! Thief! So? What now? Why'd you take off the wedding ring? Keep it on, okay? Hello... Good day Reverend. It's Franco the jeweller. The one that made the candelabras for the altar. No don't worry. It's not about the bill. I wanted to know whether the Bishop is available because... I want to get married. Why are you laughing? If I want to get married you have to marry me, no? No, my father isn't making me. Look Reverend... do me a favour. My confirmation? Don't make me get married with all the children, it's embarassing. Thank you Reverend. Reverend! Reverend... the catchisms... do I have to know them all? Franco, I have something for you. "The Good Husband.." "A Manual of Conjugal Duties" Salvatore, you want some more? Great. This rigatoni's giving me an appetite. Eat some of this. - Guido what are you doing? First you invite me, then you give him my steak! He deserves it 'cause my son's not a thief. Beautiful! The apple of your mother's eye! You came back home with a clean conscience. Bravo. - Isn't it great? Good job Salvatore. I'll give you a kiss too. They're right to celebrate 'cause you didn't steal. Look, even a cake with candles. Bravo! I should kill you for just thinking about stealing! Romolo! - What's going on? Good thing he's gone. A crazy guy spent the whole day chasing me. Who? Oh, you're throwing him a party? Maybe I should start stealing! What? What do you mean? Read the paper. Your name and photo are in it. They're looking for the thief. - Where? Here. Read. - Where? -Here! Where? - Right here. Joke's on you! You fell for it. And what do you know? I know, I know. I know a lot of things. I know for sure that I love you. Romolo, really? - Come here. You took my bathrobe? Romolo, from today on this is my home. The new boss has arrived. After we're married Marissa and I will live here. Papa's giving us his bedroom. Papa, you're giving them your bed? Daughters gets the big bed, no? Bravo kids. I'm happy you're getting married. And you'll probably be very happy. - Thank you. However, and forgive me for saying it, but let me tell you I still have my doubts about this happiness. Congratulations Romolo! Don't pull, this is a solemn occasion. C'mon, we have to hurry. Senora Cecilia... couldn't both couples get married in the same ceremony? Marissa wanted to get married in white. -So? And so? If you really must know, there wasn't enough money for two dresses, okay? Endomione, why are you crying? How can you be nervous? What is it Salvatore? When will those two get here? How do I know? Marissa. We're done. Annamaria, how does it feel? It feels special. Now hurry up! You made it! How did it go? She said yes? C'mon, c'mon, hurry! The pants! The shoes! Help me Annamaria. - Yes. - Hurry up! - Hold on a sec. Watch it now! Faster faster Annamaria! I'm coming through! Girls, are you ready? - Yes! Let's go! My jacket! My purse! Endomione! Romolo! C'mon!! Long live the newlyweds! Watch it guys! ENG SUBS by MOVIOLA
