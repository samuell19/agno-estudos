Thanks. - [Ben] Susan, hey, it's Ben. So I'm here at the hotel. Call me when you get in, will you? I miss my drinking buddy. All right, bye.

And I was thinking we should let it be a surprise. - What? - Sex of the baby. - You, you do realize that the unknown is notoriously challenging to plan for. - Yeah, but it's more exciting when you don't know. It's a big mystery. - Yeah, yeah like, um, the Bermuda Triangle or Area 51 or Bigfoot. Mysteries! - Oh! - [Katherine] Mm-hmm. - [Jasmine] Huh!

Hey, baby, that's a nice fish. - What did he catch it on? - Little spinner, the top prize for the tournament is $10,000. - You should go out and rent a boat and enter one of those. You can out fish anyone on the lake. - Oh honey, all these guys are professionals. - So? - It's $400 to rent a boat. I catch just as many from the shore. - You say that all the time and you catch more fish when you're in a boat. - Honey, with $400 we could fix the roof on the garage. - Or spend a nice day on the lake. - Oh, look at that one, look at that, oh no, oh boy. - Your birthday's coming up. - Oh hon, sweetie, I don't need anything for my birthday. - [Irene] I think you do. - Oh, card will do just fine. [cellphone ringing] - Hey Kate. - [Kate] Hi listen, I just got a call. Shut up, sorry, I'm dog sitting for my sister. The opening band for JRE dropped out last minute and they want you to take their spot. - Wow, uhh. Wow, uhh, how long is the tour? - [Kate] About eight months. God, this is insane. Why would anyone want one of these creatures? He just ate half my sandwich. - Ah, just don't give him grapes or chocolate. - [Kate] Ah, why? - Cause you'll have a dead dog on your hands. - [Kate] Tempting. [Christmas music] - Hey, new dress huh? - Honey, I wore this dress last week at Bill and Betty's party. - Oh yeah, that's, that's right.

Hi. - Hey. - Oh, come on in. You look great. - Well, thanks. So do you. [bright Christmas music] - [Madison] Mommy, Santa Claus is coming in nine days! We need to make him some cookies. - Well, what about the milk? - [Madison] We can't make milk, cows make milk. - So then, should we leave Santa a cow? - [Madison] No, silly, milk. - Okay, then milk it is.

Cheers. - So um, where are you these days? - I've got a place in L.A. but I, I don't see it much. - [Sam] How long are you in town for? - Ah, just for tonight. I have a meeting in the morning and then I fly to Paris. How's the painting? - Shitty. Fashion? - It's been a really good year. We actually started a new line and it's... It's doing really well. - You still working for your dad? - My dad died a year ago so I took over the company. - I'm sorry. - Are you? - Sorry as I would be for anyone losing their father. - Thanks. - You look nice. - Thanks, who knew you'd look so hot in a uniform? Look, I don't wanna come off as bitchy, but I just wanted to make sure you didn't think we were gonna, you know? - Oh no, no it's... No, I knew that. - I'm dealing with the whole Jose thing. And we're friends and I wouldn't ever want to mess that up. - No, yeah, yeah, I get it. Just friends going to the formal. That's what I thought this was. - Now, I feel weird for bringing it up. Sorry. - Oh no, it's fine. It's cool. - Cool. You'll still dance with me though, right? - I just don't really dance. - It's easy. Now you. - No, I'm good, thank you. - Follow my lead. Back. Forward. Oh my God, you really need help. - All right. - So like. [door clicking open] - Oh, hello. What's your name? - Hi, I'm Jasmine. - You think maybe I could get a little, sexy time later, Jasmine? - Maybe. Guess what color? - Oh, ah. Red. - Mm-mm. - Blue. - Nope. - Nothing. - Maybe so, maybe not. See, isn't a little mystery fun? - Not even a little bit. - Uh-uh! You have to finish this by Monday. And we don't wanna be late for the party. [text message dinging] [elevator bell dinging] [text message dinging] [text message dinging] [text message dinging] [text message dinging] [text message dinging] - [Courtney] I still have that painting of yours, the goat in the sneakers. - Oh my God. - That's not a failure because I smile every time I look at it. - I, I had honestly forgotten about that one. - It's a good one. It's my favorite. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Wow, so I peaked with a goat in sneakers. - Yeah, pretty much. - Oh boy and I used to believe that art could fill the void. - [Courtney] And now? - Now, oh now, I think I should have become an accountant. - You are a wonderful artist. - Keep going straight ahead, we're heading right over here. I'm gonna sit you down on the bed. Everything will-- - I'm worried about this. - Don't be worried. Oh, a little more to your left. Now, we're gonna do a little turn around. [soft music] [knocking on door] - [Ben] There she is, hey. - Hey. - How are you stranger? - Just so you know we're sharing a bottle of wine. We are not sharing bodily fluids. - What? Yeah, then I'm out. - Hey. - What, I'm just saying, there must be somebody in this hotel willing to have have sex with me for a bottle of beautiful wonderful, Pinot Noir. - Oh Meiomi. - What? - This is my favorite wine. - Get outta here. Pure coincidence. I merely picked the one with the highest alcohol content. Come on, you order it at every function, it's an easy impress. - Let's crack this baby open. - Please. - Now, keep your eyes closed. Now, come on Bob. Come on, 1-9. Oh. 1-9. 1990. 1930. No, no, no. Well, let's see. Yes, 1932, yes. Okay, here we are. There, I'm here now sweetheart. I'm here as always. - Are you? - Here, just stay right there now. I'm not finished, not finished. [soft jazz music] Open sesame. - Oh no, oh. Oh! Oh, they're beautiful. - So why am I here, Courtney? - I want to talk about what happened. - I don't really see the point. We've moved on. - I, uh. Really didn't handle things well. - No, you didn't. - Okay, okay, I thought this was gonna go differently. But I see you haven't lost your ability to shut people out. - Really, you wanna have that conversation? - Yeah, actually I do. - The one where you made the decision about our child, not with me, but with your overbearing, You wanna have that conversation? - I made that decision Sam, not my father. - Oh, right, yeah. [soft jazz music] - You didn't have to say anything. They ask us about having kids and you immediately walk off to get a drink. - Babe, I wanted another drink. We could have been talking about the weather. - But we weren't, we're talking about our family. We agreed when we got together that we both definitely wanted kids. What changed? - Nothing. - Really? - I just think we should wait until I make partner. - Another year? - Or so, yeah. - You know there's never gonna be a right time? - But there will be a better time. We need to get a bigger place. We need a bigger car. I want us to have more money saved up. - We could easily have a baby right now and make it work. - God, you're driving me nuts. We have to plan these things. - Okay, fine, let's start planning. I'm tired of babysitting everybody else's kids. - Does it have to be this very minute? - Yes, it does. - This one first. - Where in the world did you find this? - [Bob] It was in the attic when I was getting down the Christmas decorations. - I was so nervous that night. - Yeah, you were talking a mile a minute. - Yeah well, you were no help. You didn't say a word. - I most certainly did. I said you looked very pretty and then my, my, my voice cracked. I thought, well, I'd better quit while I was ahead. - We were just kids. It goes by so fast. - Hey, hey, hey. - All right, well, maybe it's my mid-life crisis kicking in. I guess the kid in me is just somewhat disappointed in who the adult became, you know? - What did the kid want you to be? - Eddie Van Halen. - You play guitar? - No. - Yeah, probably time to give up that dream. - You think, huh? Well, I'm just trying to find something that I'm passionate about that doesn't make people's eyes glaze over at cocktail parties. - All right so, quit and go do it. - And give up the company car, pension, health benefits, you crazy? - Then stop complaining about it. - Although, correct me if I'm wrong, I vaguely recall the conference in Atlanta and somebody whose name rhymes with Busan, who said that she wanted to, and I quote, walk out and go live on a beach in Mexico? - You see, see that was a company problem. That wasn't a career problem. I'm very happy now, thank you very much. - You are? - Yes. - I don't believe you. I think you've been brainwashed by the corporate fascists. - Yeah maybe, but they do sign the checks that give me my very comfortable lifestyle, and yours too buddy. - I know and I hate myself for it. That's why I've decided, I'm going to be the change. I'm going to start a revolution. You in? - What kind of revolution are you gonna start? - I have no idea, but I know it's going to be significant. - I'm not really a revolutionary kind of girl. - You don't think. [telephone ringing] I disagree, I think it suits you. You want me to step out for a second? - No, no, no, no, it's okay. - That Kevin? - Yeah. - Maybe he's flyin' out to surprise you. - Yeah, that would never happen. - Oh, is this for me too? - Of course it's for you. We start in Italy and we go all through Europe and I got us a couple of those Eurail passes. - We can't afford this. - I sold the Babe. - You what? - It was time. - Take these back and you'll get your money back. And no, you can't sell the Babe. That card, the Babe Ruth card, you've had it since you were a boy. - Sweetie, sweetie, it just sat there in the safe deposit box. Sweetheart, 50 years we've been married. I want this for us. I want this for us. - Nothing is going to change when you make partner. You're gonna work just as many hours and you're gonna be just as stressed about it, I know you. - Sweetie, we will do this, I promise. - I'm 34 now. Let's say it takes you a year to make partner then I'm 35. Who's to say that that year won't be the difference between me being able to conceive and not? You always said you wanted two kids. You hated being an only child. - We have time, Leslie was 40. - Yeah and you know what Leslie went through. Do you honestly want to see me go through that hell? Having a baby at 40 should not be the goal here. - Jas, I just can't handle anything else on my plate right now. I already feel like I need five extra hours a day as it is. - But you wanted us to take a cooking class together two nights a week. I'd rather have a baby than learn to make an omelet. - Let's see what we've got here. A surprise. Oh. Okay. What's... Oh! Oh, what do we... - I know you hated the movie, but these are the best seats in the house. - Les Miserables, huh? Look at that, oh tomorrow night. - And, uh, Laura and the kids will be with us. - Oh, that's gonna be great. - You're right. - Well, thank you. - Is there... Is there anything else in there? - Let's see. Let's see if we got anything in here. Oh! Oh, my gosh. Oh sweet. A boat? - Mm-hmm. It's from everybody. - Ho, ho, ho! I'm gonna give those pros a run for their money. - Of course you will. [crowd applauding] - Thank you very much, I appreciate it. It's always good to be back in New York, you guys always make a guy feel welcome. Anyways, this next song, I wrote for my dad. He was troubadour if there ever was one. Not too many roads he didn't go down, probably twice. [guitar music] ♪ Oh to live and rise ♪ In the morning light ♪ Burning the holly berry tree ♪ I'll be there waiting on my knees ♪ But oh, oh, oh ♪ Going home ♪ And, oh, oh, oh - [Susan] How's that OCD working out for you? - [Ben] I have no idea what you're talking about. - [Susan] I have seen the inside of your briefcase my friend. - Whatever, it's just a regular briefcase. So what? I like things to go where they go. - [Susan] I can't even imagine, what your house looks like. - [Ben] It's a romper room, let me tell you. - [Susan] Right, I'm sure, the mess. - Wanna hear a secret? I don't tell this to just anyone, so ah, that must mean I trust you. - [Susan] Oh, now you got me all hot and bothered. - Okay, I have an apothecary in my bedroom. - [Susan] A what? - An apothecary, why does nobody know what an apothecary-- - [Susan] What is an apothecary? - It's an ornate piece of furniture with some nice glass on the front. You know what, pharmacists back in the day, they used to store their medicine in there. I obviously don't do that. But what I do store, are my deodorants and my flank oils. - I'm, I'm sorry, deodorants? As in plural? - Yeah, yeah, I ship them in from New York, I'm not kidding. - [Susan] No, you always smell good. - I wasn't his puppet. I was his little girl. You know, he wanted what was best for me. - What he wanted was a pedigree he could brag about to his golf buddies. Not some broke, white artist. - He didn't care that you were white. - He would've preferred me to be Korean. - He was worried that you couldn't support me. - And were you? - No. Yeah. I don't know. - Exactly, I wasn't good enough for you. - Of course you were. - That's why you asked me, where do you see yourself in five years? Why you turned away when your friends asked me what I did? Why you kept on talking about the graphic design jobs at your dad's company? - 'Cause I was trying to help. Not that it mattered because all you cared about was your art. If only I'd been one of your paintings. - And only if I had a place in the Hamptons. [telephone ringing] - Yeah, what's goin' on? - [Kevin] Where were you? - Um, I was ah, you know, just out to dinner. I'm, I'm back at the hotel now. - [Kevin] I'm out of sleeping pills. - Okay, well the pharmacy on Tunnel is open 24 hours or you know, I did buy you that homeopathic stuff, it's in the bedroom. - [Kevin] I'll just go to the pharmacy. - Okay. I'll talk to you later? - [Kevin] Yeah, sure. - You okay? - You know that second bottle of wine is sounding real good right now. - You got it. - Vanessa Vasquez? What a slut! She's had sex with the entire school. - I never had sex with her. - Would you want to? - Well, I... No, no, not really. - This was two weeks ago. He told me he loved me. - Probably just wanted to have sex with you. - We'd already done it. - Oh. Right. - Why do I only like assholes? - Well, I mean, you know, not, not all guys are assholes. - Sorry if I bummed you out. - It's cool. - Why are you so nice to me? - I don't know. [text messaging dinging] - I don't even want to go to the party. - We don't have to, you know. We could probably just stay here and just hang out. - No. Let's go. I'm gonna change. - [Diego] Okay. - This is non-negotiable for me. - Meaning? - Well, if this isn't something you're willing to do right now, I need to consider my options. - What are you talking about? - Finding someone who actually wants to have kids. - Jas, I wanna have kids. I just don't wanna have them right now. - I don't believe you. - So let me get this straight. If I don't agree to have kids now, you're leaving me. You're giving me an ultimatum. - I guess so. [somber music] So? Nothing? No response? - I think it's best, considering how I feel about ultimatums. - I'm going to take a shower. [door slamming shut] - I wasn't ready to have a child. My father had nothing to do with it. - Look, he's gone, stop protecting him. Just... Just tell me the truth. I think I deserve at least that. - It wasn't yours. - What? - The baby wasn't yours. - Well then, whose whose was it? - Doesn't matter. - Well, it, it matters a hell of a lot to me. - Peter. - Pete... Peter, your ex? Yeah, um... How long, how long was this going on? - It was just once. - Oh, it was just once? So um... You just saw him out somewhere and then you just decided to have sex with him? - No, we were... We were at a bar, we had too many drinks and it just... It just happened. - It just happened, it just happened. Did he know? - No - Merry Christmas. - So, is this how you seduce all of your unsuspecting ladies at conferences? You know a little foot massage, a couple of bottles of wine? - I have no idea what you're talking about, I give all my friends fancy foot rubs. - Spare me the details. No but seriously, what's ah, what's your MO? - What if I told you I don't have one? - Oh, come on. - Well let's put it this way, I have never ever, bought anyone a bottle of Meiomi before. [telephone ringing] - Yes. I can't. I, I'm, I'm so... I really want to, I really, really want to, I just... - It's okay. - I can't. - I know. - Yeah, but it's my fault. I'm the one that invited you up here and-- - Hey. - I'm just in a really weird place right now. - I get it. - I'm sorry. - I'm gonna go to bed okay? - Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. [soft music] [telephone ringing] - [Kevin] Hello. - What? - [Kevin] What's wrong with you? - What's wrong with you? You keep calling me. - [Kevin] And you don't answer. - Yeah, 'cause maybe I don't wanna talk to you right now. You could send me a text, you could leave me a message. Really, can you, can you not figure out how to get online and find a pharmacy that's open right now? - [Kevin] Well I was going to. - Maybe you could get up off the couch and take Maddy to a movie. Huh? Maybe I just don't feel like being your mother for one night. - [Kevin] So you've been drinking? - I don't know. I had a couple glasses of wine with dinner. Who cares? - [Kevin] Sorry to interrupt. Enjoy your evening. - Hey, Kevin. Kev. [phone beeping] [knocking on door] - All these years. All these years, all you had to do was, was tell me. Would've been a clean break, but no, no. No, you couldn't even do that. - If it was yours, I would have absolutely kept it. - [Shannon] Is that the same guitar you had last time? - No, that one was a Martin that I picked up at a pawn shop in Nashville. - It's beautiful. - '74, good year for guitars. - How many of those do you have? - I don't know, 12 or 15, maybe? See I'm always buying and selling them. My life has become a constant search for the perfect guitar. - It's not that one? - No. I thought it was, but it wasn't. - They're like men. Perfect at first, but then their flaws come out. - Their tone's not as sweet and their A-string buzzes. - Exactly. And then you get rid of them and all you can think about is how perfect they were. - And you try to get them back, but somebody else is playing them. - And round and round and round we go. Maybe it's not about the guitars? - Maybe. [knocking on door] - Hey. - If I could do it over, I would do it so differently. - Maybe then I... Maybe I'd have been a little less self-absorbed. - I wouldn't have asked you where you saw yourself in five years. - I'm sorry about your dad. - Thanks. I'm sorry that Gladys still vacuums at 3:00 a.m. - Yep. - I hope that bitch gives him a disease. Is there any more Vodka? - I can get you some water. - Do you have a cigarette? - Nope. - You can do me if you want. - Oh, um. I'm alright. - You don't wanna have sex with me? - Just not like this. - All right then, whatever. [Bob snoring] [soft Christmas music] [text message dinging] It's Jose, wants to know what room we're in. I wonder why. - Just don't answer. Here come on, let's go. - I never thought I'd be this girl, in so many ways. - Why do you stay, hmm? - Because, well, because there's a lot of history there. - Yeah. - There's a lotta love there. Well, at least there used to be. Uh, because of Maddy. That's the truth, I stay for Maddy. - How old is she now? - Six. - Hmm. My folks separated when I was 11. - Hmm. - Ah nah, c'mon. It was miserable. There was a lot of shouting in my house. Anyway around that time, my dad he, he took me to a Dodger's game. I'll never forget it. There was this old couple sitting next to us and on the screen they were paying tribute to the 1932 Olympics in LA and, the old woman, she turned to me with the biggest smile on her face. She said, we were there. She was so proud, so happy, and she leaned over to her husband, wrapped her arms around him and put her head on his shoulder right there. I remember thinking that's it, it's that simple. That's what I want. - Listen, it was, it was good to see you again. - And, really, thank you for coming out tonight. - Sure, have a safe flight. - Thanks. And let's not make it 10 years before we see each other again. Yeah? - Okay. Yeah, deal. - Merry Christmas, Sam. - Merry Christmas. - Bye. [Gabriela retching] - Why do I keep doing this to myself? - I have no idea. - I hate throwing up. Why did I have had those three shots of tequila? - Five. - What? - You had five. - [Operator] Room service, can I help you? - Hi, could I get a bottle of the Pinot Noir and what kind of cake do you have? - I think maybe six months ago and he blames his medications, but it's hard not to take it personally, you know? - Sure. - I bought some lingerie and wore it into bed and he told me I looked nice and then he fell asleep. - Oh. - [Susan] My dad always says, you can't be responsible for someone else's happiness. - Sounds like a smart man. - He was. - Can I ask you something? - [Susan] Hmm. - Do you think that maybe, maybe it's time you move on? - You don't like your job and you don't quit. - It's true but it's a little different. - Yeah, it's a lot harder to quit a marriage. - I don't know, is it? - Yeah, you don't just like hand in your resignation and give two weeks' notice. - I get that. You know what, I've invested 10 years of my life into building my career. I'm not saying it's the exact same but-- - Then what are you saying? - Well, look, I might not be married but I certainly have commitments in my life. - Okay, but if you quit, the company wouldn't be devastated. They would just replace you and move on. - That might be true, but what are you sayin', that you're not leaving because Kevin will be devastated? - Yeah, partly. - Partly. - Yeah, of course. - See, that makes no sense to me. - Why? - I'm sorry. Why? You've already told me that you're, you're not happy, Susan. And neither is Kevin for that fact, so isn't it time you looked at other options? - Says the single guy who picks up girls at conferences. - Come on. - No, no really. Ben, you don't know anything about my situation, okay. So don't like sit there all smugly after you've fucked me-- - Come on. - [Ben] And judge me. - Who's judging you? - You are. - Don't you think you're kind of playing the victim, here? - Okay, okay. It is not the same thing. - I'm not saying it's the same thing. I'm just trying to make a point. - All right, I'll tell you what, I will go on playing the victim here and you can keep boring the shit out of people at cocktail parties. - Susan, it's not what I meant. Hey, I'm sorry, okay. Just come back to bed. [door slamming shut] [knocking on door] - What? I mugged the bellhop. - Should I call security? - I would. - Why are you always so nice to me? - Why are you such a bitch? - What? - Look, you're probably not gonna remember this in the morning, all right, so I'm just gonna say it anyway. Whenever I'm with you, it's like there's two people. There's this girl that's sweet and funny and charming and there's this pain in the ass that's selfish and drinks too much. All right, it just drives me crazy. I don't even know what you see in guys like Jose. You're better than that. You didn't even need my help in math. You could have done it on your own. You could probably go to any college if you really wanted to. You just always sell yourself short. And... And I've been in love with you this whole time. Here just take a shower, all right. It'll probably make you feel better. You know, I was really looking forward to tonight. [piano music] - I know, I know I got a better one. - Okay, all right, what is it? - This is for old times' sake. [piano music] - Oh, my favorite. Here I come. So fancy. You like that? - Whoa. - Did that throw you off? - I can't keep up with that. - Watch this. - No, if you gonna freestyle like that, I'm in all sorts of trouble. I can't. - I think we're kind of falling apart here. Oh wait, I'll follow. [soft Christmas music] [elevator door dinging] [knocking on door] [knocking on door] - Hey Diego. - Hey. - What's up homie? - Hey so, where's Vanessa? - Dude, she like passed out. Where's Gabriela? - Well, I mean she's not feeling well right now, you know, so just don't be a dick, right. She's a good girl. - Yeah. Damn man. She's got you fooled bro. Gabriela? - What are you doing here? - Hey, I just wanted to apologize about that whole other thing. I messed up. Can you forgive me? - You're a dick. I can't believe I had sex with you. - This fool right here said he's gonna leave us alone for a minute so you and I can have a talk. All right? Can you please go? - Dude, I think you should just leave. - I think you shut up? - You know what? Diego got this room for us. There were flowers and a bottle of wine when I came in, okay? He told me I was pretty. He didn't have sex with me when I was drunk. That's how I deserve to be treated. You know what, I'm sure Vanessa is wondering where you are. Don't touch me. - Whatever. You weren't worth it anyway. Not one bit. I'll be seeing you, bro. - [Charlie] So, uh, things are going well? - Yeah, Dad. Things are good. Just got an offer to-- - Did you get my postcard? - Yeah, I did. - Yeah, I was up in Montana last week, Billings. Yeah, they had a couple of gigs up there. It's a really beautiful country, I'll... I'll take you next time. - Yeah, all right. Make you a drink? - Uh, no, no, no. I'm okay. Nice guitar. - Yeah, picked it up at a pawn shop. - Yeah, that mahogany, it ages real nice. - It does. You sure I can't make you a drink? - No, I gotta get going. - No, you don't. Look just hang out for a little bit. - Yeah I'd love to, buddy, but I gotta go. - Please Dad, please. - I think my ride's here. I gotta go. - Yeah, okay. See you around. [guitar music] [water splashing] - Do you really think I can go to college? - I think you can do anything you want. - I'm not smart like you. I'm barely getting through high school. - You just, just gotta keep trying. You can always go to community college and then transfer. - Can I call you every night so you can help me with my homework? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. - You be careful out there. - I will. - You're like, so grown up. Don't get all cocky. [soft Christmas music] [birds chirping] - [Radio Jockey] Thanks for stickin' with us. We are back on WTLA, New York's best alternative rock. We are on the phone with Jack Livingston. And we have four tickets to his sold out show at The Flynn tonight. We'll give those away in the nine o'clock hour, but Jack talk to us about your writing process. Everybody wants to know what comes first, the words or the music? - Typically words, you know, get an idea from somethin' I read about or somethin' that sorta just, you know, strikes me and I gotta get it down on the page. - [Radio Jockey] Yeah, that makes sense. Lemme ask you this Jack, between being in the studio recording, playing shows or writing, which would you say that you enjoy the most? - I love bein' on the... You know, it's funny, I was gonna say being on the road. You know, you spend your whole life working for one thing and you want it so badly so you put in all the hours writing or recording or out on the road, in vans and playing in tiny little clubs. And then you taste that, just that touch of success, which don't get me wrong, I'm, I'm grateful for it, so thank you. But if I am honest with you, I think... I think the thing that brings me the most pleasure is bein' with my son. - [Radio Jockey] Spoken like a true rockstar, man. - Yeah, something like that. - Erika Edwards. We were in kindergarten and she had those cornrows, those braids, with the little beads on the end and the foil. They would click when she walked and she was so pretty. The day she held my hand, it changed my life. I loved her. I was so excited to tell my dad that Erika Edwards held my hand and how happy it made me feel. I just went on and on and on and on, on the ride home and then when we, we got in the driveway he looked at me and he said, what are you talking about? Why are you talking about that girl, that way? It's weird, unnatural. That's probably why I waited till he died to come out. The thought of bringing a kid into this world where there's so much pain possible, it just terrifies me. I don't want our children to suffer because of who we are. - We're gonna be such good parents that everybody's gonna wish they had two moms. - Yeah. Yeah. We will be. Just promise me that our baby will have your eyes. Promise? Okay. - What are you doing? No, I look awful. - I'll be the judge of that. - Hey you're supposed to say you look fabulous. - I think you're gonna like it. - Hey. - Hey. Breakfast? - Strawberry, my favorite. - Yeah, I remember you used to eat them at school. Do you want anything for your coffee? I mean some cream and sugar? - I'll take both. - Okay, cool, just one second. Yeah, they are all out of cream. - It's fine. - That's cool. Hey, so how's your head? - Not too bad. I think I threw it all up last night. - So I... I, I kinda got you a gift. You know, it's nothing big. I just thought, you know, I wasn't gonna see you for Christmas and everything. - That's so sweet, Diego. You didn't have to do that. Should I open it? - Yeah, I mean if you want, it's cool. - It's beautiful. Thank you. Thank you. - [Irene] Honey, can you help me with this? - Sure, okay just a minute. Let me see what we have got here now. Okie dokie. - You got it? - You look so sweet. I'm such a lucky guy. - No, I'm the lucky one. - Got it. - [Jasmine] Kevin? - I love Kevin, but do we really want our child to be a vegan conspiracy theorist? - Good point. - What about Paul? - Paul goes out of his way to avoid kids. - Well, that might be a good thing. He won't want to be too involved. - That's true. I don't know would it be weird? 'Cause we see him and Rick all the time. - I don't think so. He'd be Uncle Paul. - He's not a conspiracy theorist. - He's super smart. - Tall. - And really one of our favorite people. - Think he'd do it? - We did help them move. - Yeah. - That took all damn day. - All damn day. - I think that deserves a couple good swimmers. - So, what's your day like? - Hmm. I am hanging Christmas lights for one of my clients. - That's good. - Yeah, I'd rather be beaten with a two by four. - Can't be that bad. - Oh it's worse, they're always tangled, there's always one strand that doesn't work and it is cold as hell up that ladder. - But it's so pretty when they're all up. - I guess. Oh, she does give me hot chocolate with Bailey's in it, so... - Does she try to seduce you too? - Every year, but she's 105. So I politely decline. - Well, I'm glad you didn't politely decline me. [knocking on door] - Hold on. - Hey. - Hey. Come on in. Just-- Look, I'm sorry about last night, about everything. - No, no it's okay. You woke me up. You made me see things differently. Thank you for that. I am. Uh, I'm gonna leave Kevin. - Well, um... - Yeah. - You okay? - I'm okay. - Please don't do that because of what I said. - Oh, come on, no. Look, I don't want Maddy growing up thinking it's okay to be in a relationship like this. I want her to be, you know, that woman at the baseball game one day. - Then, I think you're doing the right thing. - Oh, I hope so. - Well look, I did, uh, I did wanna say something to you. This whole thing, it wasn't just a conference hook-up for me. It's more than that. - Okay. - I can call down, get us a late check out. - [Susan] Really tempted. - Yeah. - Merry Christmas. - Yeah, Merry Christmas. - Wait, why don't I hear any barking? What'd you do with the dog, Kate? - [Kate] I put some whiskey in his bowl and he's been asleep ever since. - Seriously? - [Kate] Yes. - You're ridiculous. - [Kate] So we're moving ahead with the tour, right? - No. - [Kate] Jack, it's eight months. - I know. Look, I haven't seen one of Billy's games in six months. I missed his birthday, Kate. - [Kate] Fly home more often between shows. This is-- - No. - [Kate] Jack, it could change your career. - No, I'm sorry. - [Kate] Okay, I'll tell them. - Thanks. - [Ben] Hey Jason, it's Ben. - [Jason] Hey Ben. - Yeah, listen I'll make it official tomorrow, but I wanted you to know I'm handin' in my two weeks' notice. - [Jason] Wow, are you sure? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. - [Jason] What are you gonna do? - I have no idea. Not this. - Aww, that one is cute. I look messed up in that one. - I like that one. - You would. [soft Christmas music] - Have fun with those lights. - I can't wait. Enjoy Paris. - Thanks. Do you... Do you want to come with me? - To Paris? - Yeah. - Today? - Yeah. But it's, it's okay if not. I mean, never mind, it's a crazy idea. You've got a really busy week and you gotta put up Christmas lights and I know you got to-- - I'd love to. - Really? - Really. - What about those lights? - What about the lights?
