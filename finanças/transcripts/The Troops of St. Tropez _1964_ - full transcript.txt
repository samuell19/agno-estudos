Do you recognize the victim? - It jumped into my hand. What was that hand doing in a private pond, without a licence? And it's not even the fishing season. - That's not a felony, is it? How much does it say there? - Thirteen. Twelve. - Very good. And what does it say here? When fishing for trout, the fish should have a minimum length of... Continue. - 22 centimetres. Subtract the length of your fish from 22. What do you get? 22 minus 12. Well? - Ten. So ten days in jail. And shut up. Daddy, jail is full. - True. I'll come by again later. With a wife like that, I'd have something better to do than poach. Daddy, we have to go to the choir. I'm a solo performer in the choir. I pity your daughter with a father like that. Go ahead, I'll be there. Not in the house of the Lord, my son. Come back. You can't just walk away. Ludovic, a letter for you. Express delivery. I'll get him, just wait. Nothing bad, I hope? - I'm transferred to the Var. With an extra stripe. Sergeant First Class. Thank you Lord, thank you. I'm going to show them there. Lucien, I think I see one with stripes. You're right, Albert. Let's have a look. Look, daddy, all those boats. Beautiful. I'm so happy. Control yourself. My men. Hello chief. Everything ok? - Congratulations on your daughter. What's this supposed to mean? Attention. We're good buddies from the start, right? We'll do this together, won't we? Fix that button. And you... Always look me in the eye. Always that frivolous with the kepi? Attention. Always in the eyes, you hear? Introduce yourselves. I don't hear you. Still not. What's your name? - Fougasse. Doesn't surprise me. I'm your chief, Cruchot. My daughter, Nicole. Enough. Take the luggage and go on. You won't be popular like this. - Order is never popular. Attention. One, two. one, two. One, two... Faster. Tourists, guys. Those clothes will attract snow, girl. Your pastis is waiting. - We're on duty. Aren't you thirsty when you're on duty? What are you doing to those boys? They're shy as it is. Wait a moment. Pastis for you? - No, I'm doing my first rounds. Where are your regulations about prevention of public drunkenness? We just did a paint job. - Your name? It's going to be hard work, Lucien. The holidays are over, Albert. Fresh fish... - You're not allowed to sell here. Get out of the sun, you. Go or you're in trouble. Are we sticking to the book now? Here, take it. Caught this morning. Happy now? Fish. Fish. Fresh... Do you know what it's called what you just did? Bribing a civil servant. Name? - Toinette. Stop. Sergeant First Class Cruchot. My daughter Nicole. You already know Merlot and Fougasse. This is Tricard and Berlicot. Attention. I'm looking forward to a good collaboration. The gendarmerie is like a sheepdog for the country. Often bark, sometimes bite and scare. You're the leaves, I'm the stem. Together we provide the harvest. That's all. Agreed, sergeant? - Sure. I hope you'll get used to this place. Sergeant, I have a present for you. You shouldn't have. - To celebrate my arrival. My credentials, so to speak. Nine fines already. You're not mucking around. Time is money. - The mayor's car. Smack on the crossing. - He was absent minded. I'll take care of it. Attention. You're very diligent. A bit too diligent. Don't forget I'm your superior. Attention. And keep quiet. Come look at your rooms. The ladies are with your daughter already. Attention. As you see, we're one big family. Ladies, this is Mr Cruchot. Mrs Merlot, Berlicot and Tricard. Fougasse is single. And my mother in law and my wife. Nice to meet you Mrs... - Mrs Gerber. Or C?cilia, if you like. Mrs Gerber will do. - Time to change your shirt. Of course, C?cilia, darling. You have a beautiful wife. A brave wife, I often hear. - I thought as much. Cruchot, we need a man like you here. You don't give up. There's a lot to be done here. I'll explain everything tomorrow. Wait. Wait. Oh no. - That's going too far. Very good, sergeant. Enough, enough. You're not playing anymore. Excuse me, sergeant. But where? Enough. Attention. Look at me, both of you. I can handle a lot, but I'll get you for this. Attention. Bravo, sergeant. Very well done. Shall I open it? Here, Merlot. Open it. Don't be so squeamish. - How long is it going to take, Cruchot? It's coming. Hurry. Look, sergeant. This will be a treat. There's not much in there. - He opened it. Look, chief, a starfish. Look at that. Look, sergeant. What a beautiful specimen. Look at that. Open it. Unbelievable. Another starfish. That makes two. Hurry up now. Was that the owner of the boat who just left? No, he rents the boat. An American. He must have found oil in his backyard. Want to come on board? The sailor's a friend of mine. No, thanks. Nice of you, though. Give it back. You're such a pain. My sun block. Give it, Eddie, or I'll get angry. My bra. Letters... - Jessica, how could you. It's mine. Mine. Creeps, that's mine. Where do you buy your clothes? - She'll start to cry soon. Leave the dork alone. - Nice, but still green. Are you coming? What's a dork? An unattractive girl. Don't worry, in nice clothes, you're not so bad. What's that? - A sunstroke. That's not possible. Do you see it too, sergeant? Very clearly. What are you doing? Get lost. Go inside. What are you doing in those trashy clothes? What's wrong with them? - Look at yourself. You're almost bursting out. Everybody's dressed like this. You've got your uniform, but I get laughed at. Who dares to laugh at you? Boys, girls, everybody. I'm not fashionable. Do you have to wear clothes like this to be accepted? I just want to be like the rest. You're not like the rest. You're my daughter. So this doesn't suit me? It suits you too well. Come, go put on something else. Don't you have anything less... You don't know what I mean? I really took everything out. No. Don't you have anything less conspicuous? These colours go with the sun. Your sun. As if it's your sun. Take that dress off. Daddy, what about this? - Cute, no? Looks very cute. But Mrs Vachon... That's a great dress. I'm rich and beautiful. Do you want to marry me? She doesn't have any complexes. Must have escaped from a convent. Argument with Mother Superior. Stop, I love her. You're a pervert. - No, I'm romantic. It's not going anywhere with Juliette. - My name is Nicole. Look, she can talk. Do you have any plans for later, sweetheart? Sleep in the tent with mommy and daddy. - Social holiday. I live on my father's yacht. He's a billionaire. Sorry, but I don't hang out with just anybody. Excuse me, princess. - What a blunder. What are the names of your daddy and the yacht? Come on, tell us. - My yacht is the Olnico, behind you. My father's name is Archibald Ferguson. Bud for his friends. And this is the latest Hawaii fashion... for me, it's nothing special. You don't get to see much of the world, do you? Do you know that Ferguson? No, but considering the boat and the girl, I'm on my way to Hawaii. The little girl will get far. If our old seamstress were still alive... - She'd die now. Sergeant, it's happening again in Tahiti. What? The crowds? - No, the nudists. All naked. We even got a complaint from... - From whom? We have to act right away. - It's not easy, though. Shall I go? - No, I'll get them. They've been provoking me for too long. Assemble. Careful. Do we take off our uniforms? - No, then we can't make an arrest. Attention. Ready? Are you looking for something? - The nudists. Did anyone see nudists here? - You wish, gendarme. Cruchot, Fougasse, here. We'll get them. I swear. Look into my eyes. Alert. Come on. Not too wet? - Still walking around? We'll get them. - Definitely. That way. Attack. Don't let it get to you, sergeant. We'll get them. Here's a bowl of chicken broth for you. The complaints keep coming. Soon they'll be walking into the harbour naked. Here, have some broth. I lost face, Cruchot. Let me die. Drink this. And undo that belt. Here, drink some. - One would be enough. Even a tiny one. A nudist larva, Cruchot. I'll bring you a dozen, sergeant. Are you serious, Cruchot? - If you drink this broth. Gentlemen, this is our target. The enemy is shrewd and well organised. How will we handle it, you're asking. What is a gendarme? What is a nudist? A nudist is naked. - And a gendarme? Somebody with clothes on. With a uniform. So, a naked gendarme can no longer be recognised as a gendarme. And when a nudist sees a gendarme... ...they put their clothes on and are no longer nudists. Contradicting data, we call that. What did I just say? We'll get them. - You're on guard for two Sundays. We surround the enemy from that side and that side. We close in on them like a net. We don't have enough men to do that. - Only the quality counts. That's why I'm giving you a crash course. We'll meet out there. No, not like that. Go under again, back to the beginning. Fougasse, get that sock right. No. Fougasse, still a problem with the sock. Everybody back. I've had it, chief. Have mercy. Mommy, come get me. Now, that's tough. Very good, Tricard, very good. But we can do even better. I'm nothing. I obey. - Yes, chief. I jump in the blackberries. I dive 30 meters. Your mother's first name? Madeleine. - Reply: Yes, chief. I represent justice. I hate nudists. Also on Sunday. I'm the strongest. We're the strongest. We'll get them. Tomorrow is the big day. Synchronise watches. 4.17 pm. I need a volunteer... ...who will mingle naked with the nudists. Ok, just anybody then. There's a pint under the piano. Who drinks it, will... What did you say? - Nothing, chief. You said something. - No, I didn't. Who drinks, stinks. That's mean, chief. I saw that. What did you say? - Nothing, nothing. Strange. Tonight you will go to the location. And you'll be the first one to come in contact with the enemy. Your comrades must envy you. Dismissed. - Chief, just a tiny pair of briefs... A tiny what? - Briefs. I mean... If you have to, you have to, right? Brave boy. Go for it. Careful, a gendarme. - Get dressed, quickly. We're swimming away. Like in the parade. Now G3 and G4, go on. To the beach. Everybody for themselves. Your papers. Head to the right. Another one of a 100 years old. Buy a moped. - He's doing it on purpose. Give him a push, Richard. - Yes, do. Are you crazy? Richard, careful. Bummer, police. - Are you happy now? My registration is at home. You'll regret this. - Take it easy, or you won't survive. Survive what? - Winter. Mr Merlot, he slowed down on purpose. He didn't let us pass. Refusing to be overtaken. - Thank you, Mr Merlot. You're welcome. - Don't tell daddy, please. What, you let them go? So, you're causing traffic jams. Show me your registration. That's unbelievable. Here. Shall we go for a walk the two of us? Where to? - I don't know. Doesn't matter. Is it better there than here? - Well, I said the two of us. And then what? You ask so many questions. I'm not into those kinds of walks. But it was worth a try, right? Why don't you ask Jessica? Can I join you? Swimming gives you broad shoulders. Something wrong with my shoulders? Do you prefer Nicole's shoulders? You're right. They're beautiful, Nicky. The rest is not bad either. Trust Jean-Luc on that. He's a connoisseur. Get lost, you. - Come, let's go to the bowling alley. You can be so obnoxious. What's wrong with you today? So handsome, yet so stupid. Are we playing or what? All that girl stuff. Think of me and you'll do fine. - I'm not jealous. Stop that and let him play. Not great. - Girls are only ok in the evening. Your turn. Can you play? Come on, we might still have a chance. Great. - Next time, we play together. We'll celebrate on your father's yacht. All to Ferguson's yacht. - That's not possible. Why not? - My dad isn't there. So what? I love boats. - Don't refuse him everything. Enough talk, guys. To the harbour. Driver. No. Wait. Wait for me. Is your father such a bully? - Let me through. Let me through, I said. Well... Isn't dad here? Dad. Don't look so stupid, Mathurin. - No alcohol, Mathurin. My name is Lucas. - Mathurin suits you very well. What a beautiful boat. Is your father here now? He's not here, because... - He plays golf on Sundays. The boss wants nobody on board. Go. Let me explain to you. I haven't seen dad for so long. He didn't want to marry my mother. He sends cheques, but do cheques replace a father? Of course not. But can I help that? No, I know. I'm going to a school in Switzerland. When I heard he was here, I hitchhiked all the way. Poor girl. What a bastard. Well, he's so rich and busy. A child would have been in his way. Isn't it sad? I don't want to impose. I just wanted to see where he lives. Daddy... Come on, we'll celebrate your return with champagne. Attention. One, two, three, cheers. And now three cheers for Mathurin. How nice. And now it's Christophe's treat at Senequier's. I didn't say that. - Come on, scramble. Ladies, thank the host. I'm all for youth. - Thanks, Lucas. Actually, I quite like Mathurin. I forgot my bag. With my love letters. Nice for Mathurin. - That kind of reading keeps you awake. I'll get them. I'll see you at Senequier's. I'll be right back. Who would walk out on a child like that? Don't leave. I'll prepare a cabin for you. That's sweet, but don't say anything to daddy. There he is. I'll talk to him... - He'll be furious. I'll tell him off big time. Hi, daddy. Don't be angry, I'm leaving. You have a daughter? Something's wrong here, I can feel it. - Come, I need to talk to you. Well, I need to talk to you too, Mr Harpers. All the champagne is gone. - Ten bottles. Who was here? Your daughter came back, with her friends. What do you mean? - You should be ashamed of yourself. I never saw that child in my life. I know when a kid is being honest. - I don't have a daughter. Come on, go away. - Shame on you, I say. Something's wrong here. - It's on tonight. Your glass, Cruchot. - No, the ladies first, sergeant. Your pastry's great, madam. - Have another piece. I made two. Gourmet food. - My daughter is a great cook. Give her the recipe. - She prefers to go out. Let her have fun. Another sip? No, she already had two glasses. Off to bed, you. It's only 9:30. - You can read for a while. Another game of jacquet? - You're unbeatable. Goodbye. - Good night, child. Yes, better go. They'll be playing all night long. You're right to keep a close eye on her. It's dangerous for young girls, here. Who knows the father, doesn't fear for the daughter. I simply have a calling. I hear she has quite noisy friends. That's true. - Noise is part of the times. If she does anything stupid, your career is at stake. That would be a shame. I think she's rather pale. That's why I sent her to bed early. It's the sea air. This late already? I have to go home. Is your father a police boss? - Almost. I'll take you. - No, you stay here. She doesn't want to. - What would you know? A wedding or a couple of smacks? - The latter. I think you're right. Come, let's dance. The harbour is the other way. - Man, you're pushy. Not now. There are people walking around. Wait here. Why are you running? - I'm in a hurry. I'm here. Goodnight. - You're not very sweet. If my dad saw us together... I really like you. Goodnight and thank you. Are you going to stay there? Nice car, your father's Mustang. It'll be stolen or dragged away here. So what? What are you doing? Are you crazy? Come, we're going to park it. There's room over there. Bring me a whisky. I'm getting a cold. No aspirin? - Hurry. I have to mind the car. Hey, hold the thief. Stop. The car? - Stolen, while I was lighting a cigarette. A man? A woman? - Both. I didn't see him. But the girl was your daughter. I told you from the start something is wrong. What do you want to do? - Find her and punish her. If I'm her daddy, she'll find out I don't want a daughter like that. Stop, Jean-Luc. I hate you. We're going back in a minute. Don't make a scene. Are we going too fast for you? I've driven a Porsche before, and a Jaguar... Now, only a Ferrari... Are you crying? Ok, we're going back. You're no fun, you know. I detest you. - Such big words. Your father won't know a thing. If you want, I'll tell him the truth. I'll tell him I like his daughter and that I wanted to explain to her... That I wanted to kiss you. Why are you doing that? I don't even like you anymore. Stupid of me. Are you angry? Take that car back quickly. What's the matter? Oh no, we're stuck. - Are you nagging again? Are you helping? - One moment. Hurry. Ready? Ok, step on it. Great. The oldest always gets the blame. Attach at the bottom, I told you. - The car hasn't even been paid off yet. Let's go to sleep. - Whatever, I'm driving off. You should have called a towing service right away. All this trouble for something so trivial. Madam is asleep and daddy didn't notice a thing. I don't have a bumper anymore. Did you see the time? This was the longest night of my life. Think twice about what you're going to say to me. This is very serious. Daddy, it's terrible. - Sit down. Did you do something stupid? That's it. - We stole a car. Tell me that's not true. - It wasn't my fault. Why? - A friend wanted to take it for a ride. And he ended up in a ditch. And how did you get back? - On foot. And nobody saw you? - I don't know. Maybe. That's it, my career is over. Where did you steal the car? - In the harbour. Go to bed. We'll talk again tomorrow. Where's that ditch? - On the road to Gassin. A red Mustang convertible. - Great, very inconspicuous. I really couldn't help it. - Silence. And stay in your room. A gendarme... - I'm doing the rounds. Are you checking my tractor? Well, that's your right. A sip of ros?? Oh, come on, a light wine. Believe me or not, but that headlight is broken. They break easily. You could fine me of course. - That would be petty. But the back light... There, next to the blinker. Not there, here. There's something wrong with it. - Fix it before the evening. Shall I help? - Just fix your light. You're pretty well equipped, this year, in Saint-Tropez. Go away and leave me alone. Yes, sergeant. Yes, sergeant. Right away. A Rembrandt has been stolen tonight. Probably for an American collector. So, roadblocks and checkpoints on the road. Assemble everybody. Quickly. Don't I get right of way? Where did you get your licence? You're lucky there are no gendarmes. Get lost you. Get lost. Keep it. - Thank you. Hello, sister. I have car trouble further on. Would you be so kind... Of course. - Thank you, sister. Do you pray, my son? For God's protection. God moves in a mysterious way. He leads us. I follow him with my eyes closed. Open them. There's a turn coming. A gendarme is also a kind of father. You sometimes forgive other people's mistakes, don't you? Not always, but now I repent. Careful. God says: Love your fellow man like you love yourself. That's the most important commandment, don't you know? Yes, sister. Gravel. What did you say? - I said there was gravel. I'm short-sighted. Mother Superior always makes fun of me. O my God, I am heartily sorry... You remember the act of contrition. Good. ...for having offended thee... And then what? - I detest all my sins... Careful. ...and to amend my life. Amen. Do you never have accidents? I've only been driving since yesterday. Goodbye, my son. I'm exhausted. An emergency for Saint-Tropez? - A special mission. Be discrete. We'll make way. - I said discrete. The car has been returned by a gendarme. First a fake daughter, now a fake gendarme. I really want to find them... ...and give them a piece of my mind. Nothing wrong with a bit of fair play, is there? And then he disappeared, sergeant. And you let him get away? With two cars? Sergeant, it was a very fast car. Ours starts boiling at 80... - Where were you? I did morning rounds, on my own initiative. You were needed here. A Rembrandt has been stolen. A Rembrandt that's worth millions. - Nice amount. And one suspect vehicle got away. What? A stolen car? A red convertible, chief. - A Mustang. You couldn't tell a Peugeot 404 from a Volvo. You don't even have the licence. - Too much dust. We saw who drove it. - You really saw him? Well, we didn't see him. - Did you see him or not? We saw him. - He was rather small. Balding. - I had the sun in my eyes, but... He was the short, snappy type. - A bit like your sergeant? I was afraid to say it. - Be honest. That was just a joke. Ok, dismissed. I didn't hurt your feelings, did I? I don't see you stealing a Rembrandt. Thank you. That car, by the way... Maybe a little unrelated case of theft. Better look somewhere else for the painting. But if we find the driver of the Mustang with the painting... ...we'll have our thief no doubt. I'd be surprised. - Why? Can you excuse me, sergeant? - Go ahead. What is it? - Is the car back? Yes, but I barely escaped. Weren't you grounded? And what about the groceries? - I'll do them myself. Tonight. In plain clothes. - Do I have to stay inside all that time? From now on, you only go outside with me. To your room. I have to explain something. - The car thief? Hello Nicole. Your father? Nice to meet you, Mr Ferguson. Christophe Boisselier. See you later. We're in a hurry. My parents would like to meet you. Let me get them. Why does that dandy call me Ferguson? Dad, you have a yacht, we're billionaires... Play the game, please. Andr?-Hugues Boisselier. My wife. - Nice to meet you. Archibald Ferguson, my father. Now I understand why your daughter is so popular. She's very charming. But also unruly and sneaky. Apparently, our children get along well. So should we. Are you free tomorrow? - That's my day off. Meaning, I rest after playing golf. We're organising a little party for our friends. Will you come too, Mr Ferguson? - We'd hold a grudge forever. Daddy would like to come. And me too. Right? No, I believe my dinner jacket... He means his last one from Honolulu. He only wears them once. You don't have to dress formally. We're on holiday. Be relaxed, be happy. I'm counting on you. Tomorrow, five o'clock. You'll never find it. It's very remote. It's the only way to get some peace. Daddy doesn't like to drive. - Less and less. Can Christophe pick us up? - My pleasure. Five o'clock. What's with him? Isn't that a shopping bag? - Yes, I like to go shopping. Sometimes, I cook myself too and I even wash my six cars. Great fun. Ok then. See you tomorrow. What an idiot. Come, let's go home. Daddy, there's nothing wrong with it. - Yeah, right. Not only do you steal cars, you also renounce your father. Everybody wants to impress, here. The daughter of a gendarme gets no friends. I say, that's rich! People are laughing at us... ...but we keep the peace for them. We're the victims of a big injustice. Don't get worked up. You were great with the car. I won't be a gendarme for long like this. Imagine they lock me up. My friends are very nice. You promised. I'm not going to be the clown there. And later they see me play the cop. They won't recognise you in uniform. Please, daddy. Only once. You want to ruin my holiday? When I say No, it's No! Do you recognise me? Well, you're having a good year. That car and this outfit... And that girl. Congratulations. - What do you want? Isn't this yours? I found it next to the wheel of the car you fixed. Get away from here. - I thought you had forgotten it. Have a nice evening. What is it? What's wrong? That's Merlot over there. You'll pay for this. Unbelievable. Mr Ferguson... Hello, Christophe. - Stiff neck, Mr Ferguson? No, a little cramp. Get in front. Drive. Hurry. The girl. The painting. Look, a gendarme. Why do you need a gendarme? Is this man crazy? - Yes. You'll have to excuse him. Not too drafty, Mr Ferguson? - Daddy loves the wind. Can I introduce, councillor Fourcade, the duchess d'Armenti?res... ...general Morsaline, Mrs Lareine- Leroy, recently widowed. Such an immense loss. - My condolences. I'm trying to survive. - Can I take your daughter? Come have a drink. You like paintings, I see. I myself have a C?zanne, a Degas... I just missed out on a Renoir. What do you have there? A family portrait. - You're a sensitive man. Good. Let's put it in the office first. I'm not staying long. - Still, still. I'm glad the car's back. I saw it in the harbour. Still angry? - What does it matter? You're in a great mood. Bad weather? - Stay out of it. Here it is. Put it here. Yes, here. Is it safe here? - Do you want it locked? No, I'm leaving soon. As you wish. Shall we have a drink? It's safe here, isn't it? - Of course. Come with me. Do you know what you want? - Absolutely. Still sulking? - Daddy doesn't want me to see you. Is he here? I want to talk to him. - Not now. A yacht like yours looks very comfortable. Christophe showed it to us. Can we visit one day? Please, I'd like to so much. - Impossible. It's the paint. It's just been painted and the paint doesn't dry well. When it's dry... Then what do you do? - I get paint all over me. My tailor sends me twelve suits a week from Glasgow. My daughter dresses in rags and, well, we feel quite naked. Keep it that way. Emily, I see you're recovering already. Bravo. So, you live in New Orleans. You must trade in cotton. No, in cotton wool. - Isn't that cotton? Well, that's a very technical matter. Everything from New Orleans interests me. - Such an old city, old houses... ...dark alleys, seedy gaming dens, delirious trombones... It must be quite disorienting. No? No. Incredible, genial lunacy. Such bullshit. Bischof. Huge talent. Two philosophical books in 13 years. Never awarded. It scarred him badly. To the idiots. - He's so funny. Get out of here, failed poet and successful drunk. You're extraordinary. Nobody scares you. What's wrong? He's choking. A glass of water, quickly. Excuse me. Sergeant, how nice of you to come. I knew you'd make it. To the house. To the house. - Tonight? No, you're not going. - Let your father go alone. Let's take the motorboat. Right now. Thanks, dear friend. - Tired already? An important matter. - You and I, that's what matters. My regards. The staff will take care of that. It's alright. Please. Who's playing blind man's buff? - I'm getting cigars. A Rembrandt... How sneaky. Counsellor Fourcade, no? Count Frelandvaux then. - No. One of those hip swingers? It's not fair. I give up. A cigar, sergeant? - Please. I'm exhausted. Any news? - Nothing. A Rembrandt has been stolen. Really? What a coincidence. I've got one here. From Mr Ferguson, certainly not stolen. What does it portray? - The Girl with the Tulip. But that's interesting. Do you want to see it? - Please, if I can. Come along. Look, here it is. How is that possible? It was there before. It must have disappeared. Incredible. - The thief saw a gendarme. No, Ferguson said he was going to leave soon. The owner. A very wealthy man. Maybe, but I'd like to have a word with him. If he's still here. But please be discrete. I'm your guest. - In that case... Come along. A pearl, Excellency. Seventeen years. Oriental women have such a mysterious look about them... I'd rather see their faces. No, you wouldn't want a diplomatic incident? It's her, Excellency. The shyest of them all. Mr Ferguson, are you leaving? You're here without a car? I'll drive you back. Please get in. I'm doing Nicole's father a favour. Your daughter is a sweetheart. He'd be crazy to come again. The little fellow wants to provoke us. Look. Now we've got him. - Maybe he wants to negotiate. I don't trust it. Something's wrong. Can we have a word, sir? Please humour me. - After you. His daughter is a sweetheart. Even if he's a thief, she's innocent. Have you known that Ferguson for long? - No. I don't ask my guests for their ID. You think like a real gendarme. There they are. Stop. Father with the police. Now what's going on? Afraid of gendarmes? - You can handle them, can't you? Not this one. Come on, step on it. - I always obey my father. What's happening? - Where's Nicole? Nicole, they're calling you. Get up. Is that Mrs Ferguson? Yes, why? - She's the daughter of Cruchot. I never expected that from him. Megalomania. It's sad. - Does that mean Ferguson... I said what I wanted to say. Come here, you. To the shore. I said quickly. So you refuse to say where your father is. I don't know. He'll be back. - Thieves rarely come back. Daddy isn't a thief. The Mustang was my fault. The Mustang was his job too? - See, chief? It's all my fault: the fake Ferguson, the car... Lock her up in her house. - After you, Mrs Nicole. You're overdoing it, Berlicot. She'll do anything to save her father. - That's admirable. I don't trust sentimental gendarmes, Fougasse. I'm sorry, an order is an order. - What am I doing to daddy? I bet he wanted a nice dowry for you. But stealing a Rembrandt can't be ignored. Mr Berlicot. We've fostered a snake in our bosom. We have to destroy the beast. That's the only way to come out scot-free. We have to find him. Dead or alive. And fast. My orders are simple: Go for it. Do we spread? He might be dangerous. Stay together. Come on. Courage, men. I'm behind you. Silence, or they'll lock you up too. Why are you hiding? Because your father is a thief? You know my father didn't steal a car. He returned it. That got him into trouble. The Rembrandt was in the boot. Stupid of him to carry it around. And all because of me. And you especially. What are you doing? - I want to get out of here. To the owner of the yacht, the real thief. The painting was in his car. I'm coming along. - I'll be ok on my own. That gendarme's quite cool, actually Your father, I mean. But Richard returned him to the harbour, with the painting. Hurry. We'll warn the others. Boiling hot. What do you want? We'll eliminate him. He knows too much. You don't have the right. Quick. Come on, walk ahead of me. And be quiet or... Let me through, in the interest of your little friend. Stop, villain. We're guilty. Cruchot caught us. Cruchot will be a general one day. I think I should go and say thank you to that Rembrandt.
