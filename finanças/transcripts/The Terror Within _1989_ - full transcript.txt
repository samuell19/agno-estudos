Exploration party calling Mojave lab. Exploration party calling Mojave lab. Sue, are you there? Sue? Sue, we're at three sisters. Sue, you there? Michael, they're not answering. Let me check it out. Mojave lab, come in. Sue, come in, please. Mojave lab, this is exploration party calling. Sue, are you there? Sue, come in, please. Sue, come in. Yes, Michael? What's happening? Taking a little nap? Everything's all right. Status report, please. Well, we bagged a rattlesnake. Great, get another one, and we can have a barbecue. Remember it... Tastes like chicken. That's 'cause you forgot what real chicken tastes like. Michael, check this out. We have birds over there. Hey, we got buzzards circling about a quarter mile away. Whatever it is still might be edible. We'll check it out and let you know. Okay, just be careful. Over and out. Want some? With as much cover-up as you can put in there. Mm, thanks. Ugh. What's Andre using for coffee these days? I'm not sure you want to know. Cleaning compound? It's about the right color. And the right taste. Have you and Sue finished the supply inventory? Yes, we have. I figured if we cut calories to 900 a day, Bake some game every once and a while, We can stay here for about another two months. Hal, we got to start thinking seriously About getting out of here. The Rocky Mountain lab's... Is 1,800 Miles away. We haven't had a clear message from them in ten days. Our job is to stay here. Our job is to survive. Sue, you're not gonna believe this. What is it? Jesus, gargoyles! John! John! Michael? John? Michael, John, David here. What's going on? John, Michael, this is David. What the hell is going on? You two better get out there on the double. Right. I'll get butch. Don't waste your time. He's the best tracker we got. He knows the outside better than anyone. All right, keep him under control. Just go out there and bring them back. Don't go looking for any more trouble. Is that understood? Sir, yes, sir. Ugh! This government issue shit is for the birds. Thanks for your opinion. Now fix it. David here. Nothing outside. Anything on the motion detectors? No activity. We're out of here. I sure don't like sending Sue out there. Don't worry. She's in good hands. Yeah, but I wish he'd learn to follow procedures. You love it up here, don't you? Man, I don't know how you do it. This place gives me the creeps. I just wish we were on our way out of here, Headed to the Rocky Mountain lab. Thanks. That's easy for you to say. You were trained for that kind of stuff. I just wish John and Michael would've listened to me. I told them to take butch along. If they had, we wouldn't be doing this. How could it be gargoyles? They've never come out this far before. Survivors. Maybe it was survivors. Survivors would see any one of us as just somebody to rob. Wouldn't they? I mean, I think... I think it's your turn to get the shine, Neil. Good plan. Here's looking at you, kid. Whoo. When there ain't no food, It sure does help to have good shine. You think they're gonna find anything out there? Yeah, they're gonna discover they don't have to cut rations, Not with two less mouths to feed. Well, maybe it wasn't survivors. I mean, John's last words were "Jesus, gargoyles." Gargoyles, shmargoyles. Just thank your lucky stars you're the most essential person Old Hal's got here. I wouldn't go out there to find them if they tripled my pay, Assuming there's anybody left to sign paychecks. That sucks. It sure is quiet out here. Yeah, it's always been like this, Even before the accident. The accident. You know, I used to think we'd go out in a ball of fire, Not because some leaky test tube in a lab somewhere. I still don't think it was one of ours. Come on. Ours, theirs, who cares? With 99 % of the population gone, It doesn't make much difference, does it? And now we have the vaccine, And we only have ourselves to give it to. If anyone survived out there without mutating... They must be living like savages or something. If anyone survived with those things out there. Mojave lab, David here. Yeah, David, what is it? About quarter of a mile from three sisters rocks. I think we spotted what John and Michael found. Ask him what it is. What have you got, David? Buzzards. I'll let you know as soon as we know. Didn't help them that much, did it? Oh, God. Holy shit. David, look. They have a diary too. Let's get the hell out of here. Mojave lab, David here. I think we found what John and Michael saw. It's a human camp site. Ten males, ages 40 maybe down to 10 or 11. No survivors. They've been ripped to pieces. Looks like maybe two family groups. No females? Affirmative. Males only. Hal, this could be the breakthrough We've been waiting for. If they've survived outside this long, They must have some kind of natural immunity. We've got to examine them. I don't even have a way of bringing in John and Michael. It's a long way to cart bodies, Especially if those gargoyle things are around. Then I'll have to go out there. Andre? Yeah? I need you two up here right away. Couple minutes. Fuck. David? Still here, Hal. Remain on site. Linda and Andre are coming out. We've got to check those bodies. There's not much left. Well, find the ones in the best condition. Yes, sir. No way. I ain't going out there. We've got to retrieve them for analysis. Sue and David can't do it by themselves. It's not our job. Then I'll go on my own. I'll go. Get your gear. Ow! Ow. Butch? That way. Butch. Stay here. It's a human! Stay, butch. It's all right. I'm not gonna hurt you. What's your name? Come with me. You'll be safe with me. Mojave lab. Mojave lab, David here. Where in the hell have you been? Playing hide-and-seek with a gargoyle. Tell Linda I got a present for her. Stop screwing around. I'm not screwing around, Hal. We got a survivor. A survivor? Affirmative. Female, young. Get back here just as fast as you can. You got that right, boss. We really need to take care of this. Sue, let's get her out of here. Come on. Come on! Hi, my name's Neil. Take it easy. Come on, let's get her down to medical. Sure am glad you brought her in. No way I was going out there. Yeah? You owe me one. - Anytime. - Yep, anytime. Okay, let's lie you down. I just want to take your temperature And get a blood sample. Now you relax. This won't take very long. Sue, check her pulse, please. I still don't understand how she survived out there Without the vaccine. Well it's not important, Hal. The point is, if she can survive out there, We can survive out there. In that campsite, David, How many dead? They found the shack. Hatch lock topside has been destroyed. - We've lost our eyes topside. - We know. Better get up there and check that hatch. Andre, I'm gonna need this camera operational Just as soon as possible. Gonna take some time. We're gonna have to jury-rig something. No, we won't. I got an idea. All right, I need some drain pipe. Over here. Cut me a four-foot piece, will you? You better know what you're doing, man. Neil, don't you think you ought to measure it first? All right, it's gonna work. Maybe. You'd rather go up there? Maybe. You always got to repeat everything he says? Me... fuck you. Are you getting anywhere? Well, she's got a very high "t" cell count, So she's definitely been exposed to the plague And somehow survived. But there's something else. She's pregnant. You're certain? Yeah, I ran two additional tests. Now, I haven't dealt with a pregnancy since med school, But I'd guess that she's about three months along. Well, that's all we need is another mouth to feed. Don't you see it, Hal? She's been exposed to the plague, And she's gotten pregnant. It means there's still a chance for us out there. If it's normal. You know I can't do an amniocentesis here. I'm not set up for it. Then we'll just have to wait and see. Um, does Sue know? No, not yet. Then let's just keep this between you and I Until you know some more. That doesn't seem to be very fair. I just don't want to get her hopes up In case we have to terminate it At the first sign of abnormality. We just don't have the resources here to do anything else. Okay. Damn, I wish we still had those rifles. I don't know. It might piss him off. All right, we're at the ladder. So far so good. I'm going up. Oh, shit. Christ. Hal, they're up there. We can't replace the cameras. Then set up the microphone. At least we'll be able to hear them. Yeah, right. You go. Uh-uh. Get your ass up there. Come on, man. I'll give you a cigar. No way. How about a pint of shine? You're lucky I give credit. Give me the wrench. You got it. Give me the mic. Come on, the mic! David, what's going on up there? I bet you can't read the no vacancy sign. Hurry it up, man. Jesus, the thing's gonna get in here. Would you relax? Come on. Hurry it up, man. Neil, open up! Come on, man. Move it! Open up! Man, I thought that you and me were history When that arm came through. It was two fingers, man. Yeah, it was enough. Now, about that pint of shine. That's a plan. I'm not going back out there. Anything in there? Yeah, the guy who kept it was named Randall Morgan. Roger, Marie, and Karen. He lost his wife and two of his kids to the plague. I couldn't figure out why he and Karen were spared. In any given population, There's bound to be a few with natural immunities. I guess they were the lucky ones, huh? Some luck. Anyway, it's clear from the photos we found Karen. But that's not all. Linda and Hal have been hiding something from us. That figures. I pulled Karen's data from the computer. David, the girl is three months pregnant. That's impossible. Can you imagine? What a change, having a kid running around this place. What's wrong? What if it's not one of ours? You're crazy. Linda would know if something were wrong. And according to her data, everything is fine. I hope she's right. Christ, a pregnant woman. Mm, I'll drink to that. Cheer up, Uncle Dave. Hello, Karen. Karen. It's a pretty name. I brought you something. You're so lucky. You're gonna have a baby. You don't know anything. Why are you so scared? You're safe here. No, I'm not. Would you just go away? Go away and leave me alone. Mojave lab calling Rocky Mountain lab. Listening 145.5. Mojave lab calling Rocky Mountain lab. Listening 145.5. Mojave lab calling... Mojave, this is Rocky Mountain. Transmission level three. Repeat level three. We are under gargoyle attack. Rocky Mountain lab, this is Mojave lab. Your transmission garbled. Repeat, your transmission garbled. Say all after suffered. At least we know they're still there. Yeah, maybe. Mojave lab calling Rocky Mountain lab. Your transmission garbled. Repeat, your transmission garbled. Say all after suffered. We've got a major problem. The girl. It's like her pregnancy is in fast-forward. Last night she was three months pregnant. This morning when I checked her, I'd swear she was seven or eight months along. That's not good. Linda? It's obviously abnormal. We can't take any chances. I guess we'll have to get rid of it. If possible, we ought to keep the fetus alive For further study. If it's that far along, we may be able to examine it. How's the girl doing? Her name's Karen, and she's doing much better. Sue, I'm gonna need you to help me with the anesthesia. But I don't know anything about... I made up a card with all the right parameters on it. I'll explain everything before we start. Okay. I just hope you know what you're doing. Swab, please. Pencil. I can't believe Hal wants to keep this thing alive. Nothing stops science. Scalpel. Cut from here to here. Cauterize the incision. We need to separate the muscle wall. How's it going, Sue? Right where it should be. Scalpel, please. Now the uterus. Okay, now reach in. I can feel the fetus. Shit. My hand. Hal. Hal! Holy shit, it's in the air vent. Oh, my God. Karen! Andre, lock him off. God damn it. Half of 'em ain't closing. Well, Christ, we got to lock it off. They can't get back up here, but... damn, We were gonna do maintenance on this system next week. The only way to turn the others off is manual. Is it sealed off yet? No, Murphy and his goddamn law is shitting all over us, Hal. You guys better get in here. Let's think this through. It can't get in at this level, So what are the options? Check level by level. Seal them off one by one. Send it down to storage on level four. Then gas the area. We ought to try and catch it. No way. We should kill it. Now, wait a minute. A premature fetus isn't a... Isn't what? A threat? When's the last time you saw A premature fetus move like that? I did some calculations on the computer. And going by the growth rate of her pregnancy... You can't theorize from that. It's the only database we have. I say we kill it. We have to expect the worst from now on. Yeah, damn right. Damn right. All right. We're gonna need some weapons. Andre, Neil, you got any suggestions? The welding gear. We could rig something from that. Turn it into a crispy critter. Yeah, torch the fucker. Yeah, that means getting in real close. You ready to do that? There's something else we can use. The surgical lasers... If we could create a portable power source. Radio batteries. If the power drain isn't too bad. How long would that take? Two hours. If it maintains the same growth, It will be at full size in 24 hours. You got 45 minutes. All right, it works. Whole damn four feet. Definitely within grabbing range. This thing will eat fuel like a jet engine. Check this out. Ooh, just like a hot knife in butter. It's definitely lethal. Oh, Jesus, look at that. It's a quarter of the juice just like that. A quarter of the juice. That's only four shots before you hit zero. That sucks. Okay, two teams. One with the welder, and one with the laser. The welding team is gonna start here on level two. If it's there, and you can't kill it, Try and drive it down to level three. We'll be waiting there at the outlet. If we can't get it, We'll try and drive it down to level four. There's only emergency lights on four, So watch your steps. If it gets that far, we can seal off level three. Then we're gonna follow your suggestion and gas it. Any questions? Yeah, what's the teams? You two take the welder to two. David, you and I with the lasers to three. We need the mutt on two, don't we? Sniff out the little bastard. - Makes sense. - Yeah, that's right. You take the dog with Andre. Neil, you come with me to three. - What about us? - You stay here. Oh, come on. What, do you want to end up like Karen? Wait a minute. You mean they're after the women? Thank you, Neil. Our problem's not getting any smaller. Let's get cracking. Be careful. I was never a good audience. You ready? We're on level three. Everything's okay so far. Roger. Getting ready to move along. Moving. Oh, God. Hal, they're back up topside. First thing's first. We'll deal with them later. All right, Neil. Proceeding to shaft number one. Nothing yet. Hal, we're losing our monitors on level three. Be careful. Well, what else is new? Thanks anyway. I told you about that government issue crap. We were supposed to fix that next week. Neil, open this door. Okay. Over there. Come on, man, that thing's slowing us down. Yeah, any suggestions? Yeah, why don't you wait here at the corner? Butch and I will go on ahead. I don't think we should split up. What's the matter? You scared? Yeah. Aren't you? If butch spots anything, I'll be running right back for you. Yeah. It could work. I guess. Hal? Under shaft number two. Roger. David, we're right below you now. Hal, I just checked my room. Nothing. Going on to Sue's. What is it? Just outside Sue's room. It's definitely been here. Go, butch. Go find the little shit. Hey! There's something back here! Butch, come! Down there. Hal? Yeah? We heard something back towards shaft one. We'll work our way down there. Ah! Oh, my God. Hal, it got Andre. What the hell is going on here, Hal? Easy. Hang in there, kid. Ah! Wait. No, Sue, don't! It got David! Hal, Sue's coming down to level two. Damn it, I told you to stay in the control room. Take the elevator to two. Get Sue and David back to control. Yeah, not without you I'm not. I'll be right after you. Go. I'll cover you from here. Now go. Butch. Butch, come. Butch? Butch? Butch? Andre. What the hell are you doing here? Come on, get back to the control room. The elevator. Sue! Sue! Oh, Neil. Hal, it got Sue. Hal? David? Anyone come in, please. This is Hal. The thing has got Sue. What was Sue doing down here? I don't know. She came after me. It's got her in the elevator. On four. I'm gonna get that son of a bitch. Hal, I'm coming down. Butch, you stay here. We'll be back for you. Let's go. Hold it. It's me. Where is she? Level four. I don't know how much is left in this, But you may need it. Ah, Christ. They could be anywhere in here. Oh, my God. Oh! No! Wait. Get her out of here. Now. I will mess you up, you ugly fuck. Die! Ah! Hal! We got to go back! It's too late. There's nothing we can do. Now let's get her out of here. How is she? I'm giving her a sedative. Is the elevator door locked? Yeah, the level's sealed off. What can I do? Get some of those sterile wipes over there And help me clean her up. How's he doing? He's all right. Sue? She'll sleep for a while. Let me have a look at that shoulder. Sorry. I know it hurts. Hang on. David... How long have you and Sue been sleeping together? Don't look so surprised. Can't hide something like that in a place like this. About four months. Why? Were you using anything? She told me she was. What's all this about? Come on, Linda. She's pregnant. How far along is she? A month, A little bit more. But it attacked her. If she was already pregnant, then it couldn't do anything... How do you know for sure? I don't care what kind of genetic mutation created them. There's no way it can happen that fast. It's all right, Sue. It's all right. How long have i... You've been out for the last four hours. Now just lie still. The drug's still wearing off. Last thing I remember, I was... Oh, God. Shh, it's okay. It's okay. It didn't get you. Yes, it did. Yes, it did! Sue, Sue, it couldn't. Sue, you were already pregnant. Why didn't you tell me? You must have known. I didn't tell you Because there was nothing to tell. You're wrong. You are pregnant. There hasn't been enough time. I wasn't pregnant. I didn't have any symptoms. You thought it was something else. We've all been under a lot of stress lately, right? You're wrong. Both of you, you're wrong. Come on, David. Let me deal with this. She'll be okay. Just give me a minute. Linda, I know it's not David's. Please, get rid of it. Sue, there's no way. There's no way it could be human. You can't know that. I do. I do know that. You got to get it out of me. Please. What if you're wrong? What if I'm right? There's nothing I can do right now. You're still too weak. Whatever happens, you're gonna need some rest. I want you to take these. They'll help you sleep. Now, we'll be just down the hall in control. Take them... Now. Don't worry, Sue. I won't let anything happen to you. We're almost out. We're gonna have to go out there soon. Any bright ideas? I've been trying to figure out why I could move around On the outside without getting in too much trouble. First, I thought it was butch. It turned out, they don't like him, But he doesn't scare them away. That's not gonna help us. Anything else? It moves around in the air vents, right? Yeah. If I could get in there, maybe I could trap it Or at least seal it off. And what if it shows up while you're in there? Well, I ain't sticking around to smell his breath. Coming down towards level two. I'm at the power supply on level two. There are some bare wires here. Looks like Andre was doing some work. I'll try to close the air vent. David? David? David, what's happening? Keep talking to me. I just saw him, level two. He ain't getting any prettier. I'm coming up. Any luck with that air vent? No. Damn it, it's stuck. Can't seal it off. Christ, this is great, just great. Look, I'm gonna try the Rocky Mountain lab. Couldn't hurt. All right, if you need me, I'll be in medical. Rocky Mountain lab, this is Mojave lab calling. Listening 145.5. Rocky Mountain lab, this is Mojave lab calling. Listening 145.5. David! Christ, what happened? She wouldn't wait. She tried to do it herself. Dab it, please. Oh, God, it ripped her. It fought the drug she used... Ripped her from the inside. She knew all along. She was right. Damn. If the Rocky Mountain lab's setup's Anything like this place, There's no wonder we're having trouble. There's just no damn way to seal the thing off Short of blowing up the whole lab. I think I may have found something that'll help us out. Their ears are very sensitive. Their hearing range may be up with butch, even higher. You use that thing to control butch, don't you? What? The whistle? Yeah. What happened when the gargoyle attacked butch? I don't know. I was around the corner. I couldn't see it. I called him... with the whistle? Yeah. Then what happened? By the time I got there, it had disappeared. The gargoyle heard the whistle. The sound hurt its ears. Wait. No, that's it. That's got to be it. We can use that to disable it down here. But how are we gonna do that? With the intercom. I can make a tape, Play a continuous loop of the whistle Over the loudspeakers. It won't hurt us. We won't be able to hear it. Yeah, but we still got to find the damn thing. All right, well, I'll make the tape. We'll figure it out after that. Homemade mace. At close range, it should slow him down. All right, when I get to level two, Turn that tape on. Okay. If anything happens... They won't take me alive. You're doing a terrific job. Entering level two. Turn on the tape. Okay. Main hall's empty. Coming up on Hal's room. Either it's been here, or Hal's the slob of the year. That tape's on, right? Right. I just wish I could hear it. I'm at the mess hall. Entering. Jesus. Just checked my room. Still locked. David, there's a fire on level three. Roger. Going back to the stairwell. Roger that. Ah! David, are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Just get the sprinklers on down here. - David? - Here. Circuits are jammed. I can't get the damn thing to work. That's great. I'm a doctor, not an engineer. Oh, God. David, come in. Come in! The tape's broken. Shit. David? Where the hell are you? David? David, come in. David? Ah! Crash! Linda, get back! Let's get the hell out of here. Up. Come on, David, you can make it. Just a little farther. Come on. Hold on. Let me catch my breath. Come on. God damn. What does it take? It's not gonna hold him for long. Jesus. I want you to take this. This is what we do. I know it's risky, But at this point, we don't have much choice. You ugly son of a bitch! Ah! Ah! Oh! Come on, David. Don't fail me now. Crash! Oh. David! David, turn on the power! Come on, David, hurry. Please! Ah. Thud! David? David? Mojave lab, Mojave lab, This is Rocky Mountain lab calling. Do you read me? Mojave lab, we are listening 145.5. Mojave lab? Mojave lab, come in. Mojave lab? Rocky Mountain lab, this is Mojave lab. We're here... Just barely. Adios, motherfuckers. Come on, butch.
