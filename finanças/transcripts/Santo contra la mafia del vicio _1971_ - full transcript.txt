SANTO, SILVER MASK SANTO VS THE VICE MAFIE I've never felt so humiliated And you're to blame, gentlemen! When the attorney general called me old keeper of... ...unfit trainees, I felt like hiding my face! But he's right! 5 explosions that bring down to ashes factories of basic... ...products for the nation! That is called "sabotage", gentlemen! I want you to be bulldogs! Search, scrutinize, smell. whatever, but don't come back... ...here without a lead to those criminals! Lt. Urrutia... Wait. Find Santo. Show this to him. Tell him vacation is over. You'll be partners until this case is solved. Yes, sir. You're beautiful. Life with you is so pleasant. More than with other women you've had? No comparison. I love you. you drive me crazy. Excuse me, sir. This telegram just came in. Also Mr. Sergio is here, he's in the library. I'll be right there. "Mabel Moon arriving next week from L.A." "Purpose: visit old friend from school, Patricia Ferrer"... ..."Dancer at 'Black Panther' club. "Be alert. Peces". One of your girlfriends? Don't be jealous. It's from one of my clients. - Mission accomplished. - And well directed. I saw the pictures. My congratulations... ...for you and the boys. There's another job. Quite different... ...but we'll make good profits. I'll let you know in an a few days so you get the men ready. Santo! Santo! How do you like our special cocktail, Santo? It's great! Congratulations. You've earned your excellent reputation. - It's really good. - Thanks. - Delicious. - And now, our famous ''paella. Lets keep in mind the sabotages started.. ...after the Federals seized the smuggled drugs. That load was sent from Hong Kong to San Francisco, Calif. See if you like it. If both cases are related, we're dealing with international... - ...ruthless people. - That's right. Tomorrow... ...in Mexico we'll follow that lead. YOUTUBE FILE IS WITH A SOUND FAILURE KEEP WATCHING THAT SOUND WILL RETURN - Cheers! - Cheers! I'm really happy to be with you here in Mexico. Time flies! Remember the crazy things we did... ...when we were roommates back in school? How could I forget? Those were good times. I must go, I'm next. See you later. - Okay. - Good luck. THE SOUND IS GONE AGAIN BUT HE COMES BACK This way, please. Same as always, sir? Make friends with her. We won't use violence... ...unless necessary. May I invite you a drink? I don't drink with strangers. - Just one drink. - Go away or I'll ask for help. - Hey, listen... - Waiter, please! Oh, I'm so tired! I have headache too. That number is something, no wonder! Lets go to bed, we're going out early tomorrow. Okay. Please find her! Who knows if those bastards... ...didn't kill her already. You have my word. It'll be soon, I promise. Come on, I'll walk you out. Usually, the only reason for a kidnapping... ...is asking for a big ransom. She just got here, nobody knows her. You said her uncle is a rich American... ...who owns a chemical products lab. Yes, but... ...I don't get it! I must contact the Interpol. I'll keep you informed. I'll also assign someone to protect you. I don't want anything happening to you. Thank you. I'm glad you're taking it easy and are able... ...to enjoy this beautiful day. Don't burn your brain thinking how to escape. Entering here is very easy, but going out is impossible. How is our guest doing? I gladly see my intelligent Elsa has talked you into... ...enjoying these vernal days. Vernal years you'll be spending in prison... ...when I get out of here! Hey, what's wrong? Didn't you tell her she... - ...can stroll in here, swim... - I did. ...and drink whatever she likes? But she decided to lay there just like a trapped cat. Very funny. I love your jokes... you stink. Would you tell me why you took me hostage? You'll be helpful for us to get some records... ...I hope your uncle will provide. He has been noticed... ...and is already on his way to rescue his lovely niece. You don't seem to enjoy the outdoors so, you're dismissed. Show her to her room. - I have some news. - Good ones? Would you like to meet Santo, Silver Mask? The champion wrestler and Secret Service agent? That's right. How about it? Okay but how are you going to achieve it? Everything's set. Santo fights tomorrow. How do you like our champion? I'd love to see the face under that mask. He must be very attractive. You will, I promise. - Is the car parked in the alley? - Yes, as you ordered. Hi. Sports journal. Would you... - ...give us an interview? - Sure, come in. - May I take a picture? - Go ahead. Step back. Is true your title will be at stake soon? There's a preliminary already to find me a contender. Keep still. Santo? May I come in? It's Patricia. Wear the mask! What can l do for you? I'm desperate, Santo. I spoke to the police... ...and there are still no leads... ...on Mabel nor her kidnappers. - How may I help? - Please, I'm begging you to... ...look for her. I'm worried sick, thinking... ...the worst could've happened. Calm down. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Thanks, I really appreciate it. Go see if the coast is clear. Okay, from today on, you'll be Santo. You have to... ...act just like him. You almost got it... ...but keep on practicing. You'll see my best performance. It better be. Your life depends on it. Who would say Santo, the people's idol... ...would end his glorious days in a miserable basement. He asked for it. He signed his death sentence when he helped... ...seize our load of drugs It's a pity he won't see how we're recovering it. Go light the furnace. I'll instruct Sergio. The dancer is pressing the police to find... ...the lady we kidnapped. She can be a problem. Yeah. Her number is over now, but tomorrow... ...you'll have to take care of her, no mercy. Go to the basement and do your job. Get him in the furnace. Yes, of course. Come on. I always keep my promises. Elsa, meet Santo... ...Silver Mask. - Nice to meet you. - My pleasure. Great, but how did you talk him in? I'd do anything for you. I owe you an explanation, though. This is actually Fernando Vargas, one of my men. He'll take Santo's place as of today and will keep me... ...informed about the Secret Service's moves. Where's the real Santo? All beings die, you know? Well, well. I see our wild guest... - ...accepted to join us. - Your message said... ...you have news about my uncle. Is it true? Yes, it is. He called from the airport half an hour ago. He'll be here any minute now. He's not so stupid as to come and pay a ransom... ...knowing we won't get out of here alive! - Uncle! - Mabel! Are you okay? Have this bastards harmed you in any way? Welcome, doctor Moon. Lets get down to business we want out of... ...here as soon as possible. I have a room for you. This won't be as quick as you think. But we can talk business in private, follow me. So, Farel, when is the due date for recovering our load? Santo, that is, Vargas will inform us about that, sir. I should tell you the other heads of our group are quite... ...disappointed in you. Should you fail... ...this time, you're dead meat. Yes, sir. It's a pity a beauty will blow into pieces. Set the bomb to explode in 15 minutes. Listen, mister you should know I usually... ...don't sit at anybody's table. I'm just here to tell you I'm tired of seeing... ...you across my building, at the store at the... - ...beauty parlor and here. - I'm sorry, but since I first... ...saw you, your beauty dazzled me so that... I've heard those lines a thousand times... ..from men that, like you, think us dancers are easy. You're wrong, leave me alone! Calm down and I'll explain. I'm Lt. Ra?l Urrutia. Believe me, Patricia. I do like you, but I'm here to avoid... ...something bad happening to you. I got a message from Santo asking me to keep you... ...at this table until further notice. I'm sorry for being so rude with you. Truth is... ...I found you cute since I first saw you but... ...I was just... If it weren't for your note, I'd be dead... ...like those guys in my dressing room. Those criminals got what they deserved. Listen, Patricia... ...I was protecting you. I didn't take my eyes off you. If you hadn't gotten my note on time, I would have... ...dragged you to my table even with you yelling. Why Ra?l, I was really rude to you. Someone else would have just ignored me. I was under Santo's orders. But most important of all... ...and don't tell me you've heard it before... ...I love you. I love you Patricia... and I mean it. Kiss me. How do you explain two experts were stupid... ...enough to let the bomb explode in their faces? I don't get it, everything was going okay. Anyways, the girl never got to the dressing room. She was always with that lieutenant. She must know something. When I get her, she'll regret even being born. Tomorrow you make sure the commander follows our plan. I'm sure he'll fall in the trap. You think he's ready? Vargas is a great actor. Just consider his... ...excellent impersonation. From the moment Sergio wiped Silver Mask out. I assure you... ...I embodied him and will achieve our goal. The slightest mistake may cause your death... ...and of course, we'd fail. Elsa is right. Remember in this business. ...you win or you die. Darling. You Sleep Head! Don't make this a habit. What would my friends say? This is nice. I love you so much! Want to know a secret? I'll love you forever. If you follow my directions, the plan won't fail. I agree. But one mistake and the number of... the number of... ...consumers would go up in thousands and... ...I would never forgive myself for that. If we don't find out who the head is... ...our efforts are useless. Right. We must risk to win and we will, I'll let you know the plan in 3 days. So, any news from your Santo? Yes, sir, he'll be here any minute. As soon as we get our load back we'll send it to the port. From there It'll go to its destination. Wouldn't it be better off in the warehouse? Remember the police is closing the highways. Are you in there, uncle? Watch it, don't make her suspicious. What's wrong? If you paid the ransom, why are we still here? Well... We told you we won't say anything to the police. Your uncle didn't pay in cash. He used a check from a foreign bank. You won't get out of here until I get the cash. This is awful. I'm sure as soon as he gets the money... ...he'll kill us. Don't worry, Mabel. This gentleman and I made a deal. When he cashes the check, he'll free us. I have his word. That's right. I always keep my promises. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some things... ...to discuss with these men. Lets go. I found the play quite boring. ...and the actors, well, they stunk. You're right, I was so bored I was falling asleep. I'm so tired. Would you mind if I go to bed? I feel the same way, but I still have some work to do. Get some rest. SPECIAL SERVICES AGENT - See you later, mom. - Bye. - I Won't be long, Pat. - Take care. Why did he bring you here? I didn't want to give any trouble, but Ra?l insisted. You have problems, don?t you? - No I mean... - You're in danger... ...and he brought you here to protect you. Don't misunderstand my questioning. Don't think I don't like your company. On the contrary, I'm happy have someone to talk to. Life has been hard on me. It has caused fear and uncertainty. My husband was a policeman. He was killed short after we celebrated.. ...our 10th anniversary. A medal and a grave. That's all he got for devoting his whole life... ...to fighting crime. You love my son, don't yo? Poor girl! Want some advice? - Leave him! - But, ma'am... Don't get me wrong I have nothing against you, darling. You're so young and pretty. Wouldn't be fair for you. Look at me I went crazy from so many nights o.,.. ...worry and loneliness... ...of anguish. My son is a policeman and a I think of is when will... ...he end up like his father. Leave him now, it's better. Don't destroy your life. Listen to me. If you stay by his side... ...you'll live just like me. In bitterness, fearful and lonely. With your memories... ...and a medal. Relax, baby. Your uncle is just talking business with my boss. He won't take long. Meanwhile you and I can have some fun. Leave me alone! Don't! Don't be like that, you'll like it! Get your hands off me! Don't! - What's going on! - There's an intruder! - He went that way - Lets go! Uncle! Surprise! Hide there! - Did you hear something? - No. Why? - Something wrong? - Never mind. Santo... ...may I have my ID back? Next time you want it... ..you'll find it here. Gentleman, Santo has told me where the Feds are meeting. Remember your instructions. Your attack must be quick. don't hesitate... ...and be effective. Look. Here. The burning will take place at 16:00 hrs. It's time. Remember, if you screw up you're dead meat. Hold your fire! It's Santo. - Any counter order? - None. What are you doing here then? This is... ...supposed to be a secret spot. Don't be suspicious, remember my ass is at stake. Come what may, It'll be worth to pin the head... ..of this criminals. Go on. Now! - What the hell...! - Don't kill him, the gas... - ...will be enough. - I don't care what you think! This gas is similar to monoxide, the police will think... ..it was accident. If they find bullets... ...we'll be in deep shit. Get the boxes in the truck! You're lucky, the gas didn't affect your lungs. Thank you. 20 million pesos in drugs in hands of those criminals! And Santo is to blame! - I'll pin him! - Calm down, commander. ...you've overlooked lots of things. - Like what? - Well, that toxic gas was... ...diluted. Probably Santo did it to save your lives. And the words he said, 'my ass is at stake" and... ...''come what may'' make me think he has a pretty good lead. Lets hope so. - Anything else, sir? - No, you may go now. Santo is in danger? I think so Putting. two and two together I think Mabel's... ...kidnappers and the guys who stole the load... - ...of drugs are the same. - What's the connection? I must flee to Europe as soon as possible. I'm afraid the Interpol has a trail on me. Don't worry, doctor. We've got everything covered. I hope the organization is pleased with my work. Getting the load back was one thing, but getting it out of... ...the country, and me as well, is something else. Remember I'm the head and I don't want any trouble. I know, sir, and I assure you there won't be any mistakes. We'll go over the plan tonight. By the way... ...what about your niece? When we get to Europe... ...I'll kill her myself. Stand guard, the boss is discussing important issues. Look, I'm your friend, we must talk. Promise you'll listen? I can't reveal my identity, I'm just asking you to trust me. Okay, I'm listening. I believe you're in a trap and your life is in great danger. But my uncle already paid the ransom. With a check from a foreign bank, I don't think so. Ransoms are paid in cash. What are you suggesting? My uncle..? I can't wait for this case to be over. Me too. I can't stop thinking of the danger... ...you're in dealing with those criminals. If everything turns out okay... Well, I mean... ...when we're done with this organization... You love me, don't you? You know I do. Would you marry me? Hold on... that's a code call. Code X2. - Urrutia. - Where are you, Santo? Listen, fleeing ducks tonight. Notify sector 24. Departure point showing in map ZZZ.. Coordinates 8 and 16. Copy? I'll take action before hand. I have and ally, over. Bad news? Oh, no! We're about to crack this case. Then, you and I... Your attention, Zebra 5, priority call. Investigate coordinates 8 and 16. Fleeing ducks. Copy? Go to point K. Hunter's meeting, over. - Hunters? - He meant our men. We speak in code because there might be interference. I'll got get ready, you go with my mom. I want to come with you. No, I won't risk you. It's important, I want to confirm something. No way, we'll be in danger! I don't care, I'm coming! - We found it! - This is enough evidence. Our agents should be here any minute. It'll be too late, though. Your plan was clever, but useless. Take off your mask! I said, take off your mask! I want to see your face when l shoot you. Do it or I'll kill you all! No tricks! I'm wearing infrared glasses... ...I can see you clearly. - Look, Santo! - Toxic gas! Come on! - Any news? - No. We must hurry! How far are we from the meeting point? - 20 minute ride. - Lets go! Get moving! We're trapped! Listen, we're going to open the door. Come out with your hands up and don't try any tricks! Fire as soon as Santo comes out. Yes, sir. Go! We have no choice, I'm coming out. - That will be suicide. - Nobody lives forever. Do as I say, understood? This was a miracle, Santo! Santo... ...we must go our own ways. In our business.. ...there's no room for love or friends, only danger. You're right, but before we say good-bye... ...would you like to have dinner with me? Octopus and rice, please Coming Santo. Your documents for traveling to Hong Kong. Coming? Plane takes off in 10 minutes. Santo... ...we'll meet again someday. Look, who's there! Santo! Hey, nice to see you! How are you?
