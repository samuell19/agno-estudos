(PIANO PLAYING) (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Probably wouldn't want to insure this roofing company. But what about situations like this? A storm in a hurricane zone that, since records were kept, has never been the site of a storm with winds like this. A railway crossing accident. A driver's misjudgment at a railway crossing that had never been the site of an accident before. Should we have insured the railroad company, a company with a perfect safety record, as we did? Or the merchants and the homeowners in the hurricane area, as we did? Were these acceptable risks, even if they could have been foreseen? Now, I know some in our industry don't like to hear this, especially some of our more senior members. (PEOPLE CHUCKLING) Maybe that's why they called my work the Ramsay Curve. Or maybe it's because I happened to be on the other side of the street working for the consumer's union at the time. In any case, it's time to step up to the plate. What the Ramsay Curve boils down to is this. Simply because a person has been injured, he or she can no longer be presumed to be just an innocent bystander. In fact, time and again, in Casualty and Liability, the case studies show, the greater the degree of victimization, the more responsibility the victim has for his or her own plight. You don't leave the front door unlocked if you live in a high-crime neighborhood. You don't change a tire at night on the traffic side of the car. Now, if that's true for ordinary people, why isn't it true for companies, too? Well, it is. We cannot keep blaming trial lawyers and passing on our bad risks to the consumer. The public will not stand for it, and frankly, why should they? The consumer can no longer be expected to pick up the tab for our indifference to the facts of life as we know them today. Otherwise... (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Thank you. (RADIO TURNS ON) (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) DJ ON RADIO: That was Bill Bentley, in the wake up hour here on WCTO Jazz FM, Hartford. Insurance city to the world. (EXCLAIMS SOFTLY) (MOANING) (SARAH MOANING) (SIGHING) (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) (SIGHING) It's 6:30. So? Well, if you don't move, it's gonna be 7:00. So? Thought I heard the kids. Liar. (BOTH MOANING) RICHARD: Anyway, we're allowed. As long as we don't scare the horses. Of course, we don't have any horses, but if we did... Where would we put them? You're kidding. Uh-uh. I only have a couple of pages left. When else am I gonna get to read? Graham Greene? We're supposed to be glowing. You are. (BOTH CHUCKLE) (DOOR OPENING) Momma, Daddy, are you up yet? Hi, sweetie. Hey, honey. Hey, hey, hey! Hey! You keep that up, your finger's gonna fall off. It will not! Cereal causes hair loss. Yeah? Only uneaten cereal. Does not. Eat. (MARTHA SNEEZING) It's okay. No worry. No cold. Just too much smell flowers. Good morning! Hey! Don't you look great. Well, Harvard's offering a six-week Business and Arts course again, that Leslie thinks I ought to get into if I'm thinking of getting back into gallery work. Martha can pick up the kids. MARTHA: Yes, I pick up. What about New York? The conference? You were gonna drive down, meet me after. Today? Yeah. We were gonna spend the night. Oh, my God. Why didn't you remind me? Well, looks like I have to these days, doesn't it? I didn't even check with my parents about arrangements for the kids. Are we going to Granddad's? Looks that way, huh? That's all right. Forget it. I'll call you later. You look great. Bye, little monsters. Bye. WOMAN ON PA: Flight 212, shuttle to New York now boarding at Gate 10. So did you have any luck? (SCOFFS) Can you believe it? Two hours on the fucking phone. A loyal customer for five years, and insurance won't pick up more than $2,000 damage on my Corvette. Who's your company? We are! (BOTH LAUGHING) You're right. Something's gotta be done. Yeah. How's my beautiful Sarah? Good. She returns to gallery work, yes? Hmm? Well, she told me. Sunday drinks, at your house. An old Hartford tradition. Ah, you see? I am not a husband. I listen and pay attention. See that lady? 43%, within a reduced statistical sample, that she is already spoken for. (BOTH EXCLAIMING) We are actuaries, Richard. Actuaries do it by the numbers. We are the fortunetellers of insurance. We're supposed to know the odds of what's gonna happen. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Oh, the question we're always asking is, "Are the capital reserves realistically invested?" (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Oh, thank you. ANNOUNCER ON RADIO: The temperature in Boston's a balmy 62 with increasing overcast and possible showers expected over the Boston and Cambridge areas tonight. (INAUDIBLE) Personal responsibility. You put your finger right on it, and I didn't fall asleep at all. Ever think of going into politics? I'm just getting used to insurance, Congressman. Ask him about jazz or early rock and then you'll hear him talk. Congressman Page, Abe Shinoda. Are you here to learn the way we do business, Mr. Shinoda? No, Congressman. Are you? (CHUCKLES) Abe's on our side, Vic. One of our executive team. Andre. Richard convinced him to leave National Casualty at my request. They've known each other since MBA days at Harvard Business. A citizen of Japan, but a Yankee at heart. My family sent me here to get rid of my American crush, and, boy, did they make a mistake. We're targeting Tokyo as our flagship when we expand overseas. We expect Abe to head it up. He couldn't have a better teacher. Ah! Well, you're Andre's boy, 100%. He'll offer you the Century 2000 and Beyond study, and then... Bingo! We're all part of the same team, Abe. Oh, yeah. Where? Back in Tokyo? With a father waiting to cut off my balls if I do something on my own? (PHONE RINGING) Hello? RICHARD: Hi, sweetheart. Richard, hi! How'd it go? Maybe I'll go into politics. I bet you were a big hit, as always. How about you? Cambridge was fine. Kids are asleep, but I had to send Martha home with a 102-degree allergy. We'll be lucky if we don't all come down with the damn thing. Great. (CLATTERS) What's that? Oh, Leslie. She went with me to Cambridge today. She says hello. I asked her to stay on for the kids. She's on her way to New Haven tonight. How about you? Did you get any time for yourself? Ah, you should've been here. Next time. Well, I'll be back in the office by morning. I'll see you and the kids tomorrow night. You know I miss you. Me, too. All right. Bye. Bye. Hi. Can I get some aspirin, please? Yes, sir. (READING) Ooh. Not my cup of tea, but my lady friend says I'm missing something. Leave it to the ladies, hmm? Yeah. ABE: Richard! Join us for a drink? Hey, come on. A nightcap. Uh... Good night. Hmm. Well, shall we? I'm gonna call it a night. (EXCLAIMS) Bye. (PHONES RINGING) Thanks very much. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) RECEPTIONIST: Good morning. Century Insurance. May I help you? Eli wants to know if you need the file footage any longer or should he return it to Legal? Back to Legal. And Tom Blatt's waiting, then it's Carlisle, Nye... I couldn't find my glasses last night, Janet. ...and John Tapper for division review. They're on your desk. Tom, good morning. Look, Neal does not need to send these up to us for an opinion. Tell him that's what he's being paid for. Besides, his loss-control scenario, it stinks. I have your permission? (PHONE RINGING) You have my blessing. Yeah? (PHONE CONTINUES RINGING) I always do that. (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING LOUD ON PHONE) It sounds like early Oscar Peterson. Who is this? (LISPING) Mr. Ramsay? Yeah? Hello. You don't know me, Mr. Ramsay. Your wife hired me. Uh, look... But I thought I should talk to you first. Look, if my wife hired you, why don't you talk to her? It's almost the 21st century. Women are very capable nowadays. Sir? I'm trying to tell you, your wife hired me, but you still got a chance to do something about it. About what? The lawn? Look, I'm at work, for Christ's sake! About me not killing you. Ten thousand dollars she's paying me, Ramsay. But you're an important fella. I figure you're worth more than that. For another 10, I could forget all about it. Who is this? Think of it like...insurance. A cheap, whole-life policy. I'll call again, when you've had more time to think about it. (HANGS UP) Janet, who was that just now on the private extension? I don't know. That's direct dial. I've got nothing to do with it. Anything I can do? Everything okay? Yeah. Fine. Just... Hi, Richard. Janet will get you some more coffee. Hi, Abe. (PHONE RINGING) (GRUNTS SOFTLY) Go ahead, sweetie. Hello? Sarah, hi. Is everything all right? The kids, are they okay? Yeah. I'm just picking them up from school. Why? What's wrong, Richard? (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Nothing. Just... Just give 'em a hug for me. Keep 'em safe till I get home. (SIGHING) Okay. Bye. (SOFTLY) Bye. Abe, have a seat. (MOANS) Hey. Get under there. Get some sleep. Okay. I love you, Dad. I love you, too, kiddo. Hey! Hi, sweetheart. There you are. (STAMMERS) What was that today at school? The phone call? You scared me. Oh, it was nothing. It was just, you know, one of those feelings? Somebody walking over your grave. It's nothing. I'm gonna turn on the news, all right? Oh, I may be going into Cambridge again this week. Oh? There's a sublet that might be coming up during the course. I thought for six weeks it might be worth it instead of commuting every day. Really? I know there are problems with scheduling and the kids, but there's Martha and my parents. I thought I'd just take it one step at a time. See how things work out. Whatever you think. (CLOCK TICKING) (PHONE RINGING) Yeah? (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) MAN: (IN SINGSONG) Ramsay, you got till noon Friday. Listen to me, you twisted son of a bitch. Hey. (WHISTLES) Life's too short. I'm no glutton for punishment. I know she's good for her 10. Friday. Have the money on you. I'll make contact. (HANGS UP) (SIGHS) OFFICER: Well, the phone company can't do anything without us. You're gonna need a report number. Uh-huh. Lieutenant? Mr... Ramsay. Ramsay. He says he's been getting some annoying phone calls. Okay. Have him fill out a report. Gil Farrand. I'll see you in a couple of minutes. Thank you. OFFICER: Okay. What kind were they? Obscene? Or just plain nuisance? What would you say was the specific substance of these phone calls you received? Listen, I'm gonna have to come back when I have a little more time, when we can do this properly. Thanks. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) (ALL LAUGHING) Oh, by golly! I've known this renegade father-in-law of yours since we were both pups in Central Intelligence. Now, why haven't we had you up for membership before? JESSOP: Well, he wouldn't allow it before. You see, Richard believes in making his own way in the world. He even refused a senior year scholarship at Andover so that he could finish up public high school in New York. Public? Besides, I suspect he secretly thinks we're irrelevant. Well, there's nothing wrong with being a self-made man, just so long as you remember the friends that made you that way. Warren! HITZIG: Gentlemen. Brightening up the premises, I see. Hello, Leslie. Owen. Richard. John. Horace. You both know Leslie Bullard, of course. She runs one of the better galleries in town. Which she has to get back to. JESSOP: Well, in that case, don't let us keep you. A pleasure. Nice to see you again. Richard. Doctor. In any event, I hope you follow the Jessop lead in another direction, too, Dick. Join your lovely wife by opening an account at our bank, as well. Sarah? Doing her own double-entry bookkeeping? Well, good for her. I'm sorry, Horace. I said it was a pleasure helping her set up her commercial account at the Mercantile. It'd be a privilege knowing you were doing your banking there with us, too. Well, that's certainly a very generous offer. Thank you. I'll just get the car. Okay. Richard! Hi. Thank you. Well, whatever it is, it can't be that serious. (BOTH CHUCKLING) Tell Sarah that, yes, I will be at Nora's soccer game on Sunday, with refreshments. All right. And have her call me. Yes, have her call me because my phone is on the fritz. This is what you get for not staying with AT&T. Didn't you talk to her about this on Monday? Love to the kids. Leslie, wait! Wait! Wait! You drove with her back from Cambridge. You stopped by the house afterward Monday. Did you or didn't you? Yes, I did. I was at the house on Monday. Okay, sorry. If you'd had the week I've had, you would be confused, too. Tell her, will you? I'm sorry. Yeah, of course. Okay. Bye- bye. (DOOR OPENING) How come you didn't tell me you opened an account at the Mercantile? What for? Some of the bonds bought for me when I was in college finally came due. I thought they should remain separate. Why? Well, for expenses, when I start work again. If I ever start work again. Look, I don't understand. Mine? Ours? I... I don't keep what I earn separate from you. How much? I don't know. They were under the trust. I thought there might be tax consequences. Why? Do you want an exact accounting? What's this? The kids. I told them to get it together for tomorrow. When did you decide this? Well, you're always saying we don't spend enough time together, right? (CHUCKLING) Yeah. But not now. Not tomorrow. Why? What's wrong with tomorrow? It's Friday. Extra day. Commonly called a three-day weekend. Yeah, but the kids can't just be taken out of school. Why didn't you ask me first? I thought it was important. Of course it's important. Well, maybe we should just clear everything with each other first, huh? You know, maybe we should. Yes. Like bank accounts. Among other things. What's wrong with you? Me? I'm trying to put my life into some kind of order. Why? What's wrong with the way it is now? Not a thing! But I have been a good Hartford housewife and a devoted mother, and I would like to get back to doing something for myself. But I never seem to get any support. What kind of support would you like? Any kind! Anything! Why are you drifting away from us? I'm always here. Only some of us have been a little too preoccupied to notice! (SHOUTING) What the fuck does that mean? Who do you think pays for this? I was not born with it. In case you have forgotten, I have worked and slaved for every fucking thing that we have, and I hate it! I fucking hate it! Would you keep your voice down? (BREATHING HEAVILY) I suppose that I should go have a chat with the shrink now, huh? A little fireside chat with Warren. Warren doesn't know anything. Warren Hitzig is a fucking joke! Look. Sarah. I love you. You and the kids are the only thing that mean anything to me. I can't talk to you when you're like this. I'm going to bed. Richard... I don't... I don't want to... Richard, come on. (GRUNTS SOFTLY) (MOANS) (BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY) I'm sorry. I'm sorry, baby. RICHARD: Yeah, there's a party for Tapper. Yeah. He's getting engaged. SARAH: You're kidding. I know. Listen, I'll be home as soon as I can, all right? Sarah? I love you, in case you didn't know. I had a suspicion. All right. Bye. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Goodbye, Charles. John, I gotta go. Oh, you're not leaving? Congratulations. But we haven't even poured the cake yet. Bang, bang. She shot me down. RICHARD: Oh. (INDISTINCT) Blonde bitch. (LAUGHS) In Tokyo bars, she'd be selling it, and lucky if anybody was buying. MAN: (LISPING) Yeah. Can't even eat fuckin' peanuts with this thing. A rip-off piece of shit. Fuckin' dentist. I'm no glutton for punishment. Leave that to the ladies. (CHUCKLES) American women. (SCOFFS) You don't know. You've got Sarah. Hey, maybe you could give me lessons, huh? You've had too much to drink, Abe. Maybe you can... Hey, tell them I do it different! Richard! Tell them I do it sideways! Told ya I'd make contact. Now you're gonna be a statistic. Another mugging that just sort of went awry. Unless you got 20 grand right there, like I told ya. You asshole. I could've had double. (GRUNTS) Oops. (GRUNTS) Tough guy, huh? (GROANS) Hey! (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Sarah! Sarah. Nora! Teddy! Sarah? (PHONE RINGING) Yeah? (HANGS UP) Hello? FEMALE OFFICER: Mr. Ramsay! Hartford Police! Mr. Ramsay. We got a report, sir. Your call from downtown. You... If you could just give me one minute, Officer. (RINGING) Hello? It's Lillian Jessop. Lillian! Richard! You couldn't have called at a worse time. Why? What is it? Well, I'm gonna give Nora another half hour of finger-painting before I rush her off to bed. They're there? The kids, with Sarah? And Grandpa and Teddy are finishing off their fleet, I think. Sarah and the kids, are they there? Well, the kids are here. Sarah dropped them off this afternoon. For the night. That sublet business. Suddenly, it's now or never. She said she tried to get a hold of you. Where is she? She's in Cambridge. But I think it's good for her, going off on her own. Don't you? These professional plans are just what she needs. This is very embarrassing, Officer. There seems to have been a misunderstanding. I'm so sorry. (PHONE RINGING) Sarah? MAN: Ramsay? Look, it's gotten out of hand. We... We gotta talk. (STUTTERING) I never intended this. Where are you? Meet me at Elizabeth Park. The pavilion. There's no time. Where is she? I don't know. Honest to God. It's no trick. All right. MAN: Ramsay! See? No tricks. I'm a man of my word. (PHONE RINGING) All right. Now, you said that the shots came from the shadows on your right. Yes. Did you get a look at the assailant? Any idea at all? No. Belsen, the dead guy in Elizabeth Park, did you know he was a cop? I emphasize "was," because the department got rid of him about six years ago. There was some problem with impounded goods or something. Guy's a real charmer. All right. Now, Mr. Ramsay, this is going to be difficult. You understand that. But I have to cover all the bases. How would you describe your relationship with your wife? There's no problem with me and Sarah. Mmm-hmm. You got married right out of college. Pretty early. Everything pretty good? Yes. Okay. Then, in your home life, were there any surprises? Were there any sudden financial crises or any new personal interests or relationships on your wife's part? She has nothing to do with this. I understand. My wife is innocent. In your day-to-day associations, do you have reason to believe that there was anyone who would want to harm you, who would want to extort money from you? No. No. No. Well, the way you explain it, and the way we have it figured, this is an extortion scheme. You're a successful guy. Let me ask you a question. Did you tell your wife about these phone calls? Because I know when you were here the other day, you weren't specific with us. No. Why not? I didn't want to worry her. Don't you think it would have helped? Well, I wasn't gonna let some maniac with a telephone disrupt my life. What about the break-in? What break-in? Your wife called us last month about a break-in. There was no break-in. Someone came out. But nothing was missing, nothing was found. My wife simply found the front door open. And you made no connection? There was no break-in. Mr. Ramsay, domestic problems usually have domestic reasons. Until now, you were a happily married man with a lovely wife and two beautiful children, until someone threatened to kill you. And that someone is dead now. You think I killed him? No. No. Why would I think that? You said you didn't, and apparently your gun hasn't been fired recently. But somebody put three rounds into this man. And the only other person mentioned in all of this, your wife Sarah, is suddenly nowhere to be found. Mr. Ramsay, do you have any life insurance? Lieutenant, Mr. Ramsay is very prominent in insurance. I didn't know that. How big a policy? That's not the problem. Humor me. 100,000, 200,000? I don't know. Two million. Maybe more. They're with the company, company policies. I don't even keep track. Two million. And your wife is the principal beneficiary? You have no right to pass judgment on my wife. Money is not the problem. She doesn't need money. She has money. Sergeant Dine tells me she was studying for a new career of her own. What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Mr. Ramsay... My wife is missing! She's the one that needs the help. Mr. Ramsay... I don't want to hear it. What are you doing for me and my family, or do I have to do it myself? Lowell? I'm Richard Ramsay. Sarah's husband. Yes, I know. I guess you know that we've had our problems, our difficulties. Most couples do. It doesn't mean anything. Where is she? I don't know. Look, I know that you and Sarah, you're old friends. I understand that. I wouldn't hold it against her if she and you... Did you? You don't have to say anything. You don't have to confirm it. All you have to do is deny it. Silence is assent, right? All you have to do is deny. Last summer, right? When she came up here to audit the course last summer. That was it, wasn't it? Where is my wife? I think you need to talk to somebody. Teddy! Hi, Dad! Put your jacket on. You're coming home right now. Dad, look. Where's your sister? Nora! Hi, Dad. Dad. Come on, sweetie. Watch your head. Teddy, put your... JESSOP: Richard, what do you think you're doing? Tell Sarah I've got the kids. If she wants to see them, she knows where she can find them. Come on, Teddy. Richard! And just where are you taking them, Richard? (MIMICKING TRUCKS) Teddy, time for bed, honey. When's Mommy coming? Soon, sweetie. Just get in your pajamas. I'll be right back, all right? (SIGHING) (SCREAMING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER ON POLICE RADIO) WOMAN: Robertson, can you take a look at this? (CAMERA CLICKING) I don't think the lacerations and contusions should impede identification. There are also abrasions, suggestive of burns from rope or restraints on the wrists and forearms. Don't know yet about sexual assault. (MECHANICAL WHIRRING) (WHEEZING) (BELL TOLLING) (PEOPLE MURMURING) (RICHARD BREATHING HEAVILY) Richard! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Just relax. Get off! Take your hands off me! HITZIG: Easy. Just lay still. Dad. I'm all right. TEDDY: Dad. HITZIG: Wait a minute. Just take it easy. (CRYING) Dad. It's all right, Teddy. Teddy, it's okay. It's okay. HITZIG: I dropped by Owen and Lillian's on the way over. The kids are doing fine. And Leslie's been a big help. Richard, don't rush anything. It's only been a couple of weeks. It's okay, Warren. I appreciate it, but it's really not necessary. I've got my whole life in front of me. Drugs and time. I'll recover. (KNOCK ON DOOR) May I come in? Yeah. How you doing? Functioning. I just thought I'd drop in because I was thinking, that night at the station, I was a little rough on you. No need to apologize. You were just doing your job. Well, don't let me off the hook so easily. I lost a great gal of my own last year. Heart. Still, you always wonder if there was something you could've done that would've made a difference. That's why I came. To let you know you're not alone. Anything you need. There were two of them. Had to be. And I'm not giving up. Not until I find the other guy who did this. (CHUCKLING) Red, reading Kiddie Time again, huh? Hey, what did the first elevator say to the second elevator? The medical examiner's final report on Sarah Ramsay. "I think I'm comin' down with somethin'." You're gonna be lieutenant any day with that. Don't worry. No answer on the sexual assault. No visible trauma or semen. There was a trace, however, of nonoxynol-9, a common spermaticide, found in the labial folds, uncertain how recent. And by the way, you got a visitor. A guy named Lowell Devens. (PHONE RINGING) (ANSWER MACHINE CLICKING) SARAH: Hi. You've reached the Ramsay residence. We can't get the phone right now. Leave a brief message, and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. (CALLER HANGS UP) (DIAL TONE) He was on the phone when you walked into his office. Do you know who he was talking to? No. He didn't tell you? No. Who else would know his private office number? Well, special business... Or sometimes friends. Of course, not many. Just some. (CHUCKLING) Like me. Do I need a lawyer? What do you got? Eight years ago, December 14th. And I thought you were crazy putting us through a search like this. A family-dispute- in-progress call at 22, Whitby. That's where they used to live at that time. A Mrs. Sarah Ramsay reported assault, a possible 10-70, against her by her husband Richard, 9:46 p.m. You should hear the dispatcher's tape. And that's not all. The responding officer on the call, guess who it is? Patrol Officer Lyle T. Belsen. FARRAND: Did your son-in-law have reason to believe that your daughter wanted to hurt him? You see, prior to her death, Richard Ramsay reported getting threatening phone calls, and he also reported, according to the caller, that it was your daughter, his wife, who was responsible. Now, he said he didn't believe it. We were never told. We didn't tell anyone. And as I said, he said he didn't believe it. But a man by the name of Lowell Devens recently came to see us... Yes, we know Lowell. So what is your point, Lieutenant? I thought you were supposed to be investigating our daughter's death. According to Devens, Richard Ramsay accused him of having a relationship with your daughter. This is monstrous. What are you suggesting? That Richard somehow blamed Sarah for all of this? Lillian. We located a record of the call reporting your son-in-law's assault on your daughter eight years ago. But there was no formal complaint ever filed. Why is that? It was a private family matter. Because it was nothing serious. He didn't hit her. He just frightened her. And he agreed to speak to somebody about the problems that were bothering him. Dr. Hitzig. That's an old family friend? Yes. There were only a few visits. What were the problems? We don't know. We don't believe in washing our linen in public, Lieutenant. According to the terms of the will that was filed, all of the assets ever received by Sarah from you go directly to the children. Your son-in-law is not even a trustee. No. That was put into the prenuptial agreement. By whom? By us. FARRAND: You don't want him controlling her money. Why? Don't you trust him? Is that why he felt he had to keep in force the two million dollar life insurance policy he had on her? What is the question you're really asking here, Lieutenant? (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) (EXCLAIMS SOFTLY) MAN 1: That's it. MAN 2: Nice shot, Eric. Good shot! Nice. Dr. Hitzig? Lieutenant Farrand, Hartford police. I'll have to catch up with you. Okay. I'll see you later. I'd like to ask you a couple of questions about your patient, Richard Ramsay. That domestic quarrel eight years ago, you treated him for that. Not as family doctor, but in your capacity as psychiatrist. What was that for? I'm sorry, Lieutenant, but you know as well as I do that I can't talk about this. Yes, but this is very important. The cop who answered the call that night, Lyle Belsen, the same Lyle Belsen who is now dead and who was behind all those phone calls that started all of this. Did you know that? Now, that may explain why he went after Ramsay for his extortion scheme, but it doesn't explain why Ramsay wouldn't admit to knowing him. And it doesn't explain a lot of other little things, like why there were just enough witnesses to back up Ramsay's story, but not even one to really prove it. My God! You can't be serious. There's no reason Richard should remember Belsen. The incident with Sarah came at a very painful time. Painful? More painful than telephone calls threatening your life, instigated by the woman with whom you've been living, for how many years? Doctor, do you know what the Ramsay Curve is? I'm generally familiar with it. Then you know it's what he made his reputation on back at Harvard Business School. It was based on insurance cases that he studied. The less likely an accident is to happen, it says, the greater the probability that when it does, it's your fault. Simply because otherwise, why would it happen? That's it. Simple, huh? It's an approach, a strategy. How to set up a situation so that the burden of proof is always on the injured party. I think you're misstating it. Am I? Do you have any idea how much money the insurance industry has saved on this? You see, everything is upside down now. Innocence equals guilt. The victim is always at fault, and the party who's supposed to be liable, all of a sudden turns into the party who's been hurt. In that case, why don't you ask what's wrong with our society? It's the common sense of our time. In the same way that Sarah, Richard's wife, after all the suspicion and after all the phone calls, was finally turned into the guilty party. And Richard turned into the perfect picture of innocence. The Ramsay Curve. What kind of mind would come up with something like that? I'm sure that's not what he intended. Richard can't be blamed for putting the truth down on paper as he sees it. It was a way of reminding everybody, business and public both, of their responsibility to cut costs. Doctor, what were you treating him for? I'm sorry, but there's a doctor-patient relationship involved here. Indeed, and paper covers rock. And a subpoena is paper. And why don't you just avoid all the hassles for us, because you know the judge is gonna grant my request. Certain temporary paranoid disorders. It's not as bad as it sounds. He was under a lot of pressure. So he cracked, is that it? He came in for counseling. This guy's a walking time bomb. You're talking about schizophrenia. No, I am not. I am talking transient delusional episode. It's not at all uncommon. As long as it doesn't lead to the disintegration of the personality, it's hardly to be commented on. Richard came from a broken, disadvantaged home. Everything he's got, he's got on his own. He's not some self-indulged yuppie. He's accomplished something. It's been eight years, Doctor. How do you know that in the last eight years, he hasn't been disintegrating? He had plenty of motive. Plenty of reason. His wife cheated on him. Because it was my considered opinion at the time, and nothing since has prompted me to alter it. I wanna go home, Dad, to our house. I know. I know, sweetie. I miss Mommy, Daddy. Come on, children. Come on, now. Come on now, it's time to go to bed. You have to go to bed... Let's go. Come on. Good night. CHILDREN: Good night. TEDDY: Good night, Daddy. Good night, guys. Sweet dreams. Richard, the situation with the children, it's just a little uncertain this way. What Lillian means is that we think we should formalize the arrangement. To take the burden off you, now and in the immediate future. Oh, you've already done more than enough, Owen. No, Richard. You don't understand. What do you want, Richard? Just a little more time. (BLUES MUSIC PLAYING) (COUGHING) Hi, Charley. Hey, Rich. Don't get up. Uh, can I get you something? Uh, no. Uh, look, I'm real sorry about what happened to your wife. I know she, uh... She must've been a fine lady. Tough tracking you down, Charley. Well, I... (COUGHS) I been out of the business. I need your help. Someone I can trust. Well, uh... I don't know what I can do, Rich. Takes me a drink or two to get through the day now. Hey, but we go back a way, don't we? 10 years. (CHUCKLES) Me checking 'em out, you making your notes... Harvard... You're still one of the best, Charley. Well, cops do that better these days. No. The cops don't know anything. Look, she was beaten, Charley. Her hands were tied behind her back, and she was beaten. You help me find who did this to her. Sure, Rich. Sure. (PHONE RINGING) Hi. Richard, how are you? Welcome back, Mr. Ramsay. Everything still under control, Janet? Of course. Mr. Willard wants to see you in the boardroom right away. CONGRESSMAN ON PHONE: Federal regulation? Not if I can help it. Don't worry, Andre. The public won't buy it. They're too smart. Fortunately they know how delicate and difficult the business of insurance really is. Fortunately they don't, Congressman. God help us if insurance ever does stop boring people to death. It's the only thing that keeps their hands off us altogether. It... Thank you, Vic. We'll be in touch. Richard, it's good to see you. Thank you, Andre. Rich! I wanted to reassure you, now that you're back, set your own pace, take whatever time you need. Abe will take up the slack. He's been invaluable. Simply outstanding, in your absence. He'll be taking over responsibilities for the Century 2000 and Beyond study. But we'll have to reconsider who we assign to Tokyo when we launch overseas. Hmm? Does it please you, Richard? (CHUCKLES) I... I'm overwhelmed. It's wonderful, Abe. Congratulations. Oh! Wonderful. Thank you. Sarah and I used to come here all the time as kids. We'd ride the carousel. (SIGHS) Everything comes back to haunt you. Sarah told me that when she first saw me on campus, she was with you. Just the two of you. And you flipped a coin. Well, you looked interesting. Aren't you glad you didn't win? I don't know what you thought of me all these years. Not much, I'd say. A little too much East Coast finishing school. Maybe you were even a little bit jealous of how close Sarah and I were growing up together. But I think that gives me even more authority to say what I have to say. Oh? Yeah. See, people screw up, you know. Living together, they get divorced or get pissed off and somehow see it through. I mean, God knows I've had my share of learning experiences. She saw Lowell one time, when things got really bad. Once. That was all. And when he called her to start up again, she went and met him in Cambridge to tell him no, because she loved you. And nothing that happened, nothing should ever change that. ABE: It's got to be ready by 6:00 tonight. 6:00? All right. Okay? Mr. Ramsay? Hello, Diane. I'm working with Mr. Shinoda now. I know. He asks me to collect his mail at the post office on my way in. I don't mind, if I have the time. But he opens it in front of me. Grown men there, I hear, read these kinds of things. I guess it's a cultural thing. I don't care what he does in his spare time, but I'm not interested. And I don't want to have to file suit against this company. (DOOR SLAMS) So you wouldn't call yourself a close friend? Of Richard's? I don't know. Did he ever offer you anything more than just friendship? No. So then, that would never have become a problem between you and his wife? No. Of course not. What about your family? They had a bad experience with insurance. Uh, no better or worse than anyone else... Like everybody, huh? My mother. A medical malpractice suit. But she's all right now? Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye. So now I hear you're draggin' the pond in Elizabeth Park. You wanna tell me what the hell's going on here? I'm lookin' for a gun. You're lookin' for a gun. Jesus Christ. I am your superior officer. I get a call from Owen Jessop. He wants to know about the investigation of his son-in-law. What investigation of his son-in-law? What am I supposed to tell the former deputy director of the CIA, when I don't even know what the fuck he's talking about? Did you ask them for their help? What is this, this is a joke now? We're joking? Why don't you tell them to go screw themselves. I got 30 more days on this job. Until that time is up, I'm gonna do what I'm supposed to do, what I'm paid to do. Something stinks here! What the hell are you doing to yourself? Who's gonna inherit your pension when you don't even survive disability? The doctor says I'm gonna live forever. Get another doctor. You look like shit. Goes with the territory. This time, I'm gonna hide. You guys turn around. Count to 20. Don't come find me until you've finished counting. CHILDREN: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten... It's for the good of the children, Felix. For their future. No, he can't be expected to provide a suitable home life for them. Yes, that's right. Permanent legal guardianship, Felix. You're my attorney. You know I won't settle for anything less. You know who to call. (SIGHS) ABE: You know why I love this country? Everything is possible. Rock and roll, everything! (ABE CHUCKLES) My idea to come here. To school. Mine. Not theirs. My father hated it. "Maybe," he said. "Okay, for the training." Bullshit. (BOTH CHUCKLE) For the freedom. (CHUCKLES) No more "Yes, Father. No, dear Father." Everything in its fucking place. Who is going back? You know what I mean? The possibilities, the risk! (INAUDIBLE) America! All right. You know I value your input. Hmm? I want it. You are still part of the team. You will always be a part of the team. (EXCLAIMING) Don't. Don't look at them. Mmm? They'll think we're interested. Are we interested, ladies? (INAUDIBLE) Oh, yes. You don't have to be interested, Richard. No, no. It's okay. Why not? (LAUGHING) MAN ON TV: He's alive and you're still alive, so what happened next? WOMAN ON TV: Well, we were all in... (COMMENTATOR CHATTERING ON TV) (CHUCKLING) You want a drink? No. (CHUCKLES) Don't worry about your friend. (SWITCHES OFF TV) He'll be fine. Look, um... What about you? What do you want? Hmm? Nothing? Don't. Oh, yes, baby. I want to. Let me see if I can get something started. WOMAN: Stop! (SCREAMS) Stop! WOMAN: Let me go! It's okay! You ask her! She likes it! Abe, shut up! WOMAN: Get off some other way, you fucking motherfucker! She likes it! Abe, Abe! Get out! WOMAN: Don't touch me! Abe... Who do you think you are kidding? Your wife is not even cold in the ground, and you're already chasing pussy! (GROANS) She was getting ready to go to Cambridge. Someone interrupted her and got her out of the house. Someone she knew and trusted. Somebody twisted and sick and diseased! (BREATHING HEAVILY) Why are you saying that? Was it you, Abe? Was it? No! No, I would never hurt you or Sarah! (BREATHING HEAVILY) You were my friends. Don't you know that? Go ahead, hit me! Hit me! Maybe you have nothing to be ashamed of. Maybe you have nothing to hide. (DOORBELL RINGS) I, um, was walking. Come on. Dr. Hitzig, please. Warren, Richard's here. Yeah. Last night. No. No, he didn't tell me anything. No, he's sleeping. Uh, not now. Later, in your office. Yeah, I'll let you know. Okay. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) Mr. Richard? Sarah! Richard. (SIGHS) Oh, my God. I'm sorry. I thought you could use some help. Martha said you might like Sarah's clothes put away and that you could use the help. Yeah, like with Warren? Why did you call him? I didn't know what else to do, Richard. Are you my friend, Leslie? I hope so. You were Sarah's friend. Yes. Can I trust you? Yes. Then why did it never feel that way? I didn't want to be misunderstood. Misunderstood? Why? I didn't win the coin toss, Richard. I had no business being in your life. Lyle Belsen? Lyle was a cop! I might've guessed. Yeah, we had some good times. (COUGHING) Did, uh, did he ever say who hired him to make the calls? (SCOFFS) Nah, I didn't know what he was doing. Did you ever see the guy? Who said it was a guy? Maybe it was a gal. A person. Nah. Lyle just said he had a client. Well, you know Lyle. Always flying high. (BOTH LAUGH) No. No, I don't. But let's keep talking and maybe I'll get to know him. If you make it a double. (CHUCKLES) Sure. (COUGHING) (PHONE RINGING) RICHARD ON TAPE: Hello. You've reached the Ramsay residence. We can't take your call right now... Ah, shit! ...so leave a message and we'll get back to you as soon as we can. Yeah. Hi, Rich, it's Charley. Give me a call. I got something for you. Bye. (EXHALING) (CHARLES GROANING) (SCREAMS) Dad! Dad! Dad! (BREATHING HEAVILY) Where's Dad? Sweetheart, you're having a nightmare. Aw! It's Nana. Nana and Granddad love you very much. Where's Dad? Aw, we love you. Okay, come on, back to sleep. He's gonna lose everything. Most of all, the children, if he keeps going on like this, Warren. I don't get it. What's happening? Even Lieutenant Farrand was sending out signals. Leslie, this isn't your problem. Oh, no. Right, yeah. I'm just supposed to keep looking out for number one all the time. I know you're still trying to sort out your own feelings about him. This isn't about my feelings, Warren. And I know you've done a pretty good job of not showing them till now. (SIGHS) No. Not so good, actually. You've got nothing to be ashamed of. Leslie, it's not just Sarah's death. There were phone calls, he told the police. Phone calls threatening him, which he says Sarah was responsible for. No. I don't believe that. No. Of course not. Nobody does. Nobody wants to. Leslie, the police are working from the very real possibility that Richard hired Belsen to make those calls. No. Stay out of this. Richard gave up a lot of what he was to become what he wanted to be. We may just now be finding out the cost. (INDISTINCT CHATTER ON POLICE RADIO) All right, take it. The manager found him at 8:00 this morning. His name is Charles Wallace Ives. He used to be the chief insurance investigator for the Seavers Agency. Apparently, he was one of the best. Lieutenant! I found something. PPK .380, seven-shot clip, three shells expended. Okay. Run it through Ballistics. Anything new, I'll be in touch right away. Thanks very much. Thank you. I just spoke with Felix. Papers should be on their way to your chambers now. Thank you, Harry. Yes, yes, it is. Very unfortunate. Harry Bolles at superior court. I'm requesting that he grant us a temporary restraining order. Why? What did Farrand want? A man, a friend of Richard's was found this morning downtown, bludgeoned. Ives, that insurance investigator who helped Richard with his research at Harvard. They also found a gun. They're checking it now. Now, if this Ives was the man that was involved with Belsen... And Farrand thinks this could be definite. I mean, it could seriously implicate Richard in Sarah's death. This order will keep Richard away from the children, until we have permanent legal custody. Teddy and Nora are Sarah's children. They're Jessops. That's all that counts. He never did accept us, did he? Ask Louisa to get the children packed and ready. We're going to Essex, to the cottage. (DOORBELL RINGS) Louisa, hi! Would you open the door? It's locked! (FOOTSTEPS RETREATING) Louisa? Louisa, where are the kids? (GLASS SHATTERING) Louisa, where are the kids? What? Who is this? Who is this? ON PHONE: Mr. Ramsay, this is Felix Caudell, attorney for Owen Jessop. Your father-in-law has requested that I inform you that you have been temporarily enjoined by the Connecticut Superior Court from seeing or visiting with either or both of your children, and that if you persist, a permanent injunction will be issued against you. May I also suggest that you leave the premises immediately, as you are presently guilty of criminal entry and trespass. Please? Teddy, Cousin Agnes is expecting us. Granddad will take you on the boat tomorrow. Come on. Pinky promise. (INAUDIBLE) Richard! Do you know that there are men, hunters, the last that you'd expect to take out a policy, and then they blow off a leg, an arm. They don't care what they lose, just so that they can collect. You've been under a lot of strain. Let's go back to the cottage. We can talk. Tell me that it's not true! Tell me that you are not responsible. There are... There are people that can see... You know, I can't sleep! I go home, I can't sleep. And then today, why not Owen? So much to gain, money, posterity. He's made murder an instrument of national policy. Why not domestically? You just didn't realize that it would backfire and kill your own daughter. This is madness. Where are my children? You're not taking my children! (GRUNTS) Richard! (GUNSHOT) Richard! (GROANS) Owen! (COUGHING) Hey, pull it over there! Owen, grab the pole! Help! Over here! MAN: Hang on, Owen. (KNOCK ON DOOR) It's open. I've just come from the cottage. Owen's fine. He's a tough old goat. But he'll still be pressing charges, and, uh... They'll be looking for you, Richard. Call Farrand. He can help you. Tell him your side of the story. I've been looking in all the wrong places, haven't I? I mean, it all just comes right back here to me. You know that Teddy and Nora think that you're great. (RICHARD SIGHS) Richard, don't do this to yourself. They need someone that they can count on. Someone that they can trust. Richard. No. Lieutenant Farrand is not here. Is it important? Yeah. He told me to call anytime. Fridays Lieutenant Farrand usually spends at the Ridge Center, just outside of town. If it's important. (CAR ENGINE STARTING) The markings from Ives' gun sure as hell resemble the markings from the bullet that we pulled out of Belsen. And you're right again, genius. We lifted a print off of Ives' gun, which is very interesting. It matches Ramsay's. Congratulations. Mmm. We'll be issuing a warrant to pick him up. But somebody still has to tell the Jessops. I've come this far. They're at their cottage in Essex. I know. You don't sound very happy. It's not over yet. Well, keep me posted. I'll talk to you. Thanks, Liz. More than welcome, Lieutenant. Now, that's as of the fourth. I can check, but I don't think it includes payments for Bobby that insurance won't cover. Are you okay, Lieutenant? I'm okay. It's just every now and then my back wants to show me who's boss. Excuse me. I was looking for a Lieutenant Farrand. Farrand? Yeah. Oh, try the pool. First exit. Left. Can I help you? Hi. Yeah, I'm looking for Lieutenant Farrand. Oh. He left a little while ago. Are you a friend of Bobby's? Bobby Buckner, Lieutenant Farrand's stepson. Though you'd never know it. He treats Bobby like he was his very own. Visits him every chance he gets. Well, his mom died last year. She wasn't too well, anyway. Not that she was hurt in the accident, but she was suffering ever since. Accident? The train accident. The Tylerville crossing. She was driving. The signal wasn't working. Freight train plowed right into them. Worst part, insurance company for the train, they said it was her fault. Driver's error. Bobby's mom, for not paying more attention. He'll have to transfer to county pretty soon. I don't see how else the Lieutenant's going to do it. It's already taken every penny he has. The results of the tests on that gun mean nothing. The prints could've been lifted. There're a million ways those prints could've gotten there. I understand that, but at the moment it's not my business to prove anything. All I know is I cannot afford to put any of you at risk. And the department can't give you adequate protection here. You want us to return to Hartford? It would be easier, and safer. Well... Hello. Hello, Teddy. How would you like to see the inside of a police car? Oh, yeah! Yeah! Do you mind if I take him on ahead? JESSOP: No, I think that would be fine. Be my pleasure. Just take me a moment to get his things ready. Be a good boy, now, Teddy. This'll be cool, Grandma! John! Richard! Where's the case file footage? The footage used in your presentation? Yeah. With Legal. That was returned a while ago. All right. Call Garber in Legal. Four years ago, a liability case. A railway crossing accident. Buckner. At Tylerville. I want all the raw, unedited footage you can get. Were we or were we not the underwriting company? ANDRE: Richard? Richard? What is it? All set? We appreciate your concern, Lieutenant. We'll meet you at the house. Yes. Very good. Thank you. All right, Teddy. Let's go. ANDRE: Richard, I know, but there are procedures, liability. We can't just go opening up company files and making available unedited case footage, not even in house... What are you talking about, Andre? It's me. I created those files. Now, the plaintiff's name was Buckner. Look, were we the underwriting company? Richard, I'm really sorry, but this is policy! Yes, we were. ANDRE: Abe, stay out of this. He filed suit against Mid-Atlantic Rail and us for over ten million. Abe! There's no reason for you to remember it. It was just one of those times. Abe, that's enough! You've found a place with us here at headquarters. Don't jeopardize it. One of what times? There will be no more discussion of confidential information. Insurance operates in a hostile environment! One of those times when you were asked to testify as an expert insurance witness. The first time, though, in a case of our admitted liability. Teddy, that side sometimes sticks. Come on, we'll go around the other way. (INDISTINCT CHATTER ON POLICE RADIO) Go on, scoot over. TEDDY: Whoa! That's a good boy. Bye, Grandma. Bye. Can you outsmart speed traps, too? It was a faulty railroad crossing signal, but Legal argued driver error. At least, that's what they told you. They needed you to testify, to present the Ramsay Curve to question blame. It was their only chance. Ten million dollars. And it worked. Your testimony made all the difference. The jury decided in our favor unanimously. (WOMAN CRYING ON TAPE) That's him. That's the boy. You lied, Andre. You twisted it. How many times? How many lives? Come on. It's policy. It's a general principle. You said so yourself. Richard... Get your fucking hands off me! (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Leslie, it's me. Listen, listen, the kids. Tell Owen and Lillian to keep them there, no matter what. All right, now listen to me, Leslie. Four years ago, there was a railway accident in Tylerville at a crossing. A boy was crippled, a woman was injured and never really recovered. They sued, they lost. Richard, what does all this mean? Leslie, the woman was Lieutenant Farrand's wife. The boy was his stepson. Leslie, it's Farrand. The man who killed Sarah is Farrand. He planned it all because of me, because I testified. He hired Belsen and killed him. He killed Ives because he holds me responsible. Who is it? Let me talk to him. Leslie, I am not insane. I have seen the boy. Leslie... Richard, stop him, Farrand. He's got Teddy. In the car. They just left. Where? Hartford. Oh, God, Richard. Tylerville is on their way. Owen, what could it hurt? It only would take one phone call. The train is going through there at 3:25. So he's drawn you in, too, has he? So now it's Lieutenant Farrand who's responsible? But they'll listen to you! No! I certainly will not call Bill Morris at Mid-Atlantic Rail and ask him to delay the only scheduled run he has for the day! I'm not a fool. We are talking about the life of your grandson. No, we are not. We are talking about Ramsay, the man who murdered my daughter. I thought you had some affection for Sarah's memory. God damn you. Richard never had a chance with you, did he? You would rather risk your own grandson's life just so you can have it your own way! Trains used to run here all the time. No more. Everything's changed. Nothing means the same anymore. Good people are called bad. When I was growing up, good people were never called bad. I knew your mother, you know. One time, when she thought there was a burglar, I came out to investigate. But it wasn't a burglar, it was me. In fact, I was the last one to see her alive. That's how close we were. You didn't put on your seatbelt. Put on your seatbelt. This won't take long. TEDDY: Let me go! (BELL DINGING) (GRUNTING) Don't cry. It won't help to cry. (TRUCK HONKING) (HONKING) No! Let me go! Oh, my God, I'm heartily sorry for having offended Thee. Because of thy just punishment, but most of all because my sins offend Thee, my God, who are all-good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace, to sin no more... (HONKING) Dad! (ENGINE FALTERING) Come on. Come on. (SCREAMS) Dad! Dad! No! No! Don't! Don't! Dad! (GRUNTING) Teddy... TEDDY: Let go! (GROANS) Dad! Dad! Teddy! TEDDY: Dad! Give him back to me! Doesn't take much, does it? You can't really insure yourself against it, huh? Dad! A few phone calls, a few pressure points. What do we make such a fuss about it for? Give him back! Huh? Life's one big fucking accident anyway! You let him go! He's not responsible! That's the dirty little secret, isn't it? Insurance, the real extortion racket. Pay up and you'll be safe, when they can't really do shit about making anything better! TEDDY: Dad... It's all right, Son. He won't hurt you. Let him go. Nothing I can do is wrong. You understand? Dad! I am suffering personally. I bet you they'll even let me file for stress. You let my boy go. He had nothing to do with this. Even that first time, when I checked out your house, it wasn't my fault. The door was unlocked. How about that! Just like you said, "No crime there! "A break-in that wasn't even really a break-in." You killed my wife! You did! And what about me? What about my Mary Ann? (TEDDY CRYING) It was hard enough to see the boy, but to watch her go, it was something that she thought she did! Somebody's gonna pay! No. No. It all ends right here. The fault, the victims... It all ends right here. You just let my boy go. Do you miss her, Ramsay? Do you? Good. 'Cause now we're even. Dad... (SIGHS) Go on, Teddy. Go on. (LAUGHING) Teddy! (GROANING) (CLICKING) (SIREN WAILING)
