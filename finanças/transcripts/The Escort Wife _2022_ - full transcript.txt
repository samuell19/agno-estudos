--== McEphie ==-- Oh, well... Here we go again. Another day of making a living. Because I'm not rich. My husband is. This work-from-home routine? It's getting boring. Oh, well. I just got paid yesterday. Here I am... Same place. Same spot. And the same view. Maybe I should find a new adventure. I wonder what. So... Are you coming home late? Can I go out by myself? So, what now? Should I order food for us? Okay. Yeah. I love you. Patricia? Oh, shit. Are you okay? Fuck. Wait! What happened? Why did you lock the door? Nothing... I just fell asleep. I was so worried! I'm sorry... I need to go back to the hospital. I promise... We can have breakfast together tomorrow. Hey, I'm sorry about what happened. It's okay. It's my fault. Gotta go. Bye. I love you. I love you. Take a shower. Sweetheart? - What? - Can I go back to work? It's different when you're in the office. It's been a while. You know? I'm just here at home. I'm so bored and... I'm healthy enough to work. Please? Doctor's order sweetheart. You're too fragile. You can't risk it. - He just said two... - No. He said three to four. But, that's a very long time. I'm so bored here already. Why don't you invite your friends to come over? Look, I just have one friend. Joanne. She's not here. Oh yeah? Where'd she go? Out of the country. I'm going to sleep. I'll just eat later. Fuck. You startled me. I'm sorry. Sorry too... Hey... What time are you coming home? I can't really talk right now. I really miss you. Should I wait for you? No. I'm on night shift. Sorry. I didn't know. Should we have breakfast together? Maybe. Hey, I gotta go. I love you... Hey! What's that? What? What? That. That! Wait... I need to take a shower. Is that my tank top? Hey, are you alright? I wanna take you out to lunch. What? Let's go out. Let's eat out. This is still my favorite place. Thank you. Right?! Yeah. You know, we used to come here a lot. Is it our anniversary today? Just celebrating. Celebrating what? Say 'hello' to the new head of the orthopedic surgery department. Oh my God! I'm so proud of you! Congrats! Thank you. Here it is. I'll have the... - bone-in ribeye... - Okay. Herb-glazed carrots And broccoli salad, please. What? We practically ordered the same thing.

We have beer. No. I have work tonight. - Alright. - Okay, sir. Thank you. Do you know her? No. Do you? Sweetheart... Hi. - Wait... - Stay here please. I... I have an appointment. I have to go. Stay here please. Stay, please? Stop. Stop. Stop, please. Hey, come here. I really have to go. Alright? I have to go. I'm sorry... Girl... I can't go back to work yet. It's very complicated. You have no idea. I can understand why Roy is so concerned... But, it doesn't mean you can't go out by yourself. When are you coming back? In five months. Five months? Shit. That's still a long time. Yes, shit. I have nothing to do here. And, girl... I haven't scored yet. I haven't had one good fuck yet. What are you talking about? You're not the only one. I haven't had one too. What? Girl... Go out. Have a drink or two. And a fuck or two? Hi. Miss Patricia! You haven't been back in a while. The other time, we just had lunch. Where's Doc cutie? Work. I just wanted to chill for a bit.

I'm not here to fight with you... pull your hair... Or be scandalous. I just wanna know... where the fuck my husband is. How long... have you been having an affair with my husband? We don't have an affair. Fuck the both of you! I've seen you many times by my kitchen window. You're fucking different men. And now, my husband. Shit. Shit, what? I'm... I'm not cheating. So, Roy's cheating on both of us? Look... Patricia... Roy is just a client. Just like that. What? So... Roy fucks and pays you? I'm really sorry. Please don't tell my husband that I was here.... and that I know. And don't you ever see him again. Roy! I'm leaving. I'm transferring school. I have some savings more than enough for my college and for the next ten years. I wanna see your bedroom. Huh? Can I ask you something? How do all these work? How are you able to do this? I get calls. If the cash or crypto is transferred, then, we make a schedule. One client a day only. And strictly at 8:30 PM. Also nothing... after eleven because... School. What? You don't like late night and staying up late... Because you have school. Yes. Did you know that Roy is practically your neighbor? No. I know what they do for work. But... I don't know where they live. Wait. I'll get something. I have a client list. It's handwritten. Here... You're probably a much better accountant than me. Please... These? These are their schedules? Yes. So many cheaters. James! What's up? James. Sure. Anytime dude. Yeah. Yes, I'm free. Come over. Bring Charles. What's that? I'm hanging out with the boys tonight. I have. Yeah. Yes, I have a lot. Bring ice. Sorry... Wear something nice. - That's really funny, bro. - Of course, I got it. You know, bro? I miss this place. This place misses you too Charles. That's my favorite. Funny. It's funny. That's the last guys. Do you need anything else? Thank you, sweetheart. Isn't she pretty? Yeah bro. Hundred percent. I'll marry her in the future. When you are dead. Fuck you! I love you so much, Patricia. If only... 'If only,' what? We can switch lives. I used to have fun you know. But... I think I need a new adventure. And leave my husband... As a revenge. Make your own adventure. Go out. Where are you going? I'm done. What's gonna happen to your clients? - You can have them. - What?! Take my clients. Are you serious? Maybe... This will be your new adventure. It's not that bad. Have you ever fucked other men? My clients are well selected. They don't know each other. Even if they may know each other in real life. All of them are rich, married, and have something to lose. That's why I know all their secrets. And I keep a record of it. Isn't that... The same as blackmail? Call it whatever you want. I call it 'security.' Leverage. I don't do blackmail. It's not good for business. This is for you. I'm not used to wearing perfume. You need it because... that's me on your skin. And also... keep a knife handy. And make sure you know all their moves. Make them happy. They will pay you well. Do you want me... to teach you? How? Hey. Where've you been? Joanne's back. I met with her. Shouldn't you be staying home? Did you drink? Nah, I didn't drink. You didn't cook so I ordered out. For myself. Are you hungry? I just ate. Thank you Chrissy. Miss Patricia, this is the property. Just let me know what else you need. I'll takeover the lease. Chrissy has settled this. It's all yours for the next eight months. All paid for. Please sign here. I'll keep your apartment, Chrissy. And I will live your life. These clients... They are mine. Assholes. Asshole. Jerk. - Hello? - Hello?! What perfume? You messaged me. Sexy and perfume. That was for Joanne. We were just messing around. You know, because... she's dating a new guy. She was the one I was texting with. Good for her. Yes, good. I'm so happy for her. Fuck! Leverage.

This meat. where'd you buy this? I got this from the supermarket. The deli was closed. Not bad. Not so good either. Angel! Angel! Angel! What's wrong with you?! Are you trying to kill me? Son of a bitch! Patricia! Can you get us glasses and ice, please sweetheart? Let me help you. No. Dude. It's fine. She can handle that. - Sure? - Yeah. So... How's your day, bro? Same as usual. What the fuck is wrong with you man? What were you saying? What's wrong with you? Hey. You alright? - You good? - Yeah, I'm alright. Nothing is for free. - Sweetheart. - Hey. Hey, what happened to you? - Nothing. - You're drunk. No. Slowly. Oh, man. Good for her. Yes. I'm so happy for her. This tastes good. But, it's the wrong cut. Not bad. Not so good either. I love you. Take a shower. You practically stripteased for that waiter. What the fuck? It doesn't suit you to be so sexually aggressive. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. I'm excited for your surprise. Chrissy... Chrissy? Is this a new phase? No more blindfold? Chrissy? Chrissy's not here. Fuck you. What?! Are you bored with your friends that's why you're here? And speaking of friends... I fucked your best friend James right here. And he paid me. Fuck... Precisely. I fucked your best friend twice. Fuck. Here and in our bathroom. It felt so good. I enjoyed every bit of it. Fuck! What... What is happening here? Fuck. What are you? Huh? Are you... Are you a prostitute? Like Chrissy? Are you a fucking whore? You're a whore?! Yes! I'm a whore. And it's not Chrissy... It's me. You... fucked me. What's happening here? Why are you doing this? You took me for granted. I didn't take you for granted... I was just working. You changed... when we lost the baby! I was giving you space to grieve! Space?! Space so you can fuck around?! It wasn't about 'fucking around!' You weren't there! I needed you! When you had the miscarriage, you're the one who changed. I don't even know you anymore, Pat! I don't believe you. I was grieving too! I was broken like you! I don't believe you! Stop it! Stop it! Fuck! Stop! No, please... Not my hand. Not my hand, please? Please... Alright, I'll leave. If that's what you want... I'll resign from the hospital. Please. Please don't. Just no scandal, okay? I want everything. Your car... The house... And money. - Give me everything. - Alright. It's yours. I need to go to the hospital. I have all your videos. I will ruin you, you fuck. Get out of my life. I'm so sorry. What are you going to do now? I don't know. But, doing that to Roy, seems so satisfying. You know... But, it's not enough. He's gone, Pat. Yes, he's gone. But, there's still a lot of them out there. Like our clients. My clients. No. Remember? Leverage? It's bad for your business. I'm not satisfied. My revenge to Roy, it's not enough. I'll expose all of you... Cheaters. Chrissy... Hello? Chrissy, can you hear me? Chrissy, hello? You ruined our lives. I'll find you, you whore! Fuck you, whore! Whoever you are... If you're a wife cheated by your husband, I'm on your side. You are a bitch and you will die! One more threat... and I'll release all the videos. Including yours whoever you are. Stop bothering me! My husband took his own life. Because of you. You whore! - I have nothing to do with that. - I don't care if he fucks around! I don't care because he still goes home! You ruined our family. You bitch! Fuck you! You killed my husband! Whore! You're a whore! Fuck you! My husband is not perfect. But, I love him. And this... is his gun. I'm not a whore. Those men are satisfied. I get paid. It's a fair transaction. I have two jobs now and working from home. See? Look at this guy. Not the dating material. But he pays big. I just got paid.
