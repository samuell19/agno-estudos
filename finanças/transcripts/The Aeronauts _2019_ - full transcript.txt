How bad is the tear?! We need to lose more weight! Stop the carriage! Amelia? Are you quite well? You don't need to fly today. You can return to Richmond with me. Antonia, I just need a moment. After all you've been through, no one will think worse of you. I would. I would think worse of me. I have an agreement with Mr. Glaisher. You barely know the man, and the little you do, you're irritated by. Antonia, please, I... just need a moment. One last piece of sisterly advice. Doubt is there to be listened to. Come and get your tickets! Amelia Wren! How high will she go?! And afterwards, I've got to take you straight to... Amelia Wren! Well, I read all about it... Hey, you! Get out of the road! Come on. Move along. She's late. She is, but that's the least of your concerns. We'll lose the light, John. James, do the clouds not look ominous to you? I repeatedly explained to Miss Wren the importance of catching the right light and the right wind at the right time, - and she's just openly ignored me. - James, look up. It's not a concern, John. The readings I took this morning were quite clear. Far be it from me to doubt you, James, but your weather predictions have been wrong in the past, and it's just possible that you've missed... Don't even think of it. Ah. Ned Chambers, John Trew, my very good friend. John, this is Ned, one of the hardy entrepreneurs who's invested in our expedition. Do not even think of telling me flight is not possible. Mr. Chambers, we are scientists of the air, and we can tell you the one thing no one can control is, well, the air. I have paid for gas. I have paid for silk. And is this balloon not the strongest and largest that's ever been? Even so, it can't fight the weather. You don't want to be responsible for a tragedy, sir. I don't wish to be responsible for refunding the 10,000 that came here because you promised them history. We'll fly, Ned. We'll fly. I only need the sky to hold for 90 minutes, and once we're above the cloud line, we'll be fine. Good. That's fixed, then. Now, did you not promise me a 5:00 ascent? I'm set. I'm merely waiting for our pilot. And it's not the first time Miss Wren has kept me waiting. What a truly pleasant man. One must make compromises in order to achieve greatness, my friend. And he... is merely one compromise. Hello, everybody, and welcome! Welcome back, Amelia! Are you ready? Amelia! You're incredibly late. Lesson number one of aeronauting: We are creatures of the skies and have no respect for landlocked clocks. Mr. Glaisher, are you really not a gentleman at all? Hold out your hand to me. - Go on, Glaisher! - Go on! - Take her hand! Look like you've never seen a woman before! - Don't keep a lady waiting! - Come on, Mr. Glaisher! Take her hand! Take her hand, Mr. Glaisher! You're naughty! Are you ready? Mr. Glaisher, you have no conception of how ready I am. Posey! Good dog. She's got a dog! Posey. No, no, no. No, absolutely not. Under no circumstances are we taking a dog. I told you we'd have to play to the crowd, and they prefer my dog to your boxes. Those are essential meteorological instruments. And this is an essential dog. She's called Posey. The essential... Posey! Go on. In you go. Excuse me. Ladies and gentlemen, today, myself... Amelia Wren... my naughty scientist, Mr. Glaisher... and my wonder dog Posey are going to change the world. Are you ready for us to do so? This balloon on which I stand... the Mammoth... is a balloon like no other, and will allow us to ascend higher into the air than any man or woman has ever gone. The French rose to 23,000 feet. Today, we will break that record and reclaim it for these fair shores! Who knows? We may reach the Moon and bring back... stardust! Today is a day when history will be made, and you will all be a part of it. Mr. Glaisher, now is your moment. Up you get. Fireworks? Are you ready? Yes. I just need to retake my ground readings and then do one final check of the equipment. Well, my equipment was all prepared in advance. Now, don't touch this rope, Mr. Glaisher, 'cause it will let out the gas. I do know how a balloon works. Uh, what are you doing? We fly. - The sky awaits. - Wait, no. These ground readings are essential. If they're not accurate... Godspeed, old man. Goodbye! - What are you doing? - Giving the people their money's worth. W-Will that not damage the integrity of the balloon? Perhaps. Goodbye! For God's sake. Goodbye! This is absurd. It's what they call entertainment, Mr. Glaisher. Well, I'm not finding it particularly entertaining. It requires a... a sense of humor, which you seem to lack. This is ridiculous. Don't be so sour. Give me the dog. What do you mean, give you the dog? - Pass me Posey, Mr. Glaisher. - I'm not giving you the dog. Mr. Glaisher, the dog. Now. Goodbye! Quick. - Come on! - What, you just want me to... - what, just pass her to you? - Pass her up. - Yes, pass her up. - All right. - Come on, Posey. Come on. - All right. No, don't! Did you see that? Well done, Posey. Come on, Posey. Come on, girl. There he is. Ah! Mr. Glaisher, you are airborne for the first time in your life. I suggest you spend less time frowning at me and... more taking in this beautiful world we've just left. Quite something, isn't she? London. It all looks so... Insignificant? Do you take anything seriously, Miss Wren? Some things. That crowd gathered to witness us break the height record. They didn't need to see a flying dog. Mm. Still stuck there, are you? I've spent much of my life being laughed at for what I do, Miss Wren. I'd rather hope that today might prove an exception. Tell me, what determines your reputation? My reputation? Yes, your standing in the scientific community. The papers I've written, the discoveries I've uncovered. Your reputation is built on paper, and my reputation is built on screams. And those people below, they came to be entertained. And they, if you didn't know, are the ones paying for this trip. You off to the opera? I've been looking at the same thing. Don't tell me that cloud isn't a cause for concern. I'm the scientist; you're the pilot. Let's stick to our roles, shall we? James! - James! - Come on, John. - I'll not miss the takeoff. - It's in the air. We could have stayed on the ground and looked up. We must see it from the best vantage point, Johnny. For God's sake. Sky's clear, so I predict a clean takeoff, which means that in precisely 24 seconds we should see it. You are aware he might not make it off the ground? Charles Green will make it off the ground. Maybe not quite so close to the edge of the building. Listen, John, will you stop scowling at me? - Sc... - Do I count the hours that I spend helping you pin butterflies to a board? Pinning butterflies is not a dangerous pursuit. Five, four, three, two, one. Could be anything. The gas valve ruptured. The silk tore. He's rethought the balloon shape. It's wider at the top, like a parachute. That's very clever. May I look? Yes, you may. Here. John. If you've had time enough... You'll get your chance, you know. They'll realize your worth. I think they know my worth quite well enough. Gentlemen! Gentlemen! We-we know more now about this world around us than at any moment in our history. And yet, still, still, we are limited by our ignorance as to what is truly above us. Now, with the progress that we have made in balloon ascent here at the Society, pioneered by Charles Green, we could advance meteorology by decades. Analysis of the Earth's magnetic field, the solar spectrum, knowledge of the dew point, understanding of oxygenation of the atmosphere, - atmospheric... - He wants my balloon! No, sir. No, sir, I ask for funding for my own expedition into the skies. By gathering enough data, I believe that we will be able to uncover patterns - and correlations that... - Sir, we are scientists, not fortune tellers. You're talking about weather prediction. But is that not our responsibility as scientists, to find order in chaos, gentlemen? Please, if we could understand the sky above us... You are no closer to predicting the movements of the weather than the movements of a frog in a jar. If we could understand the skies above us, gentlemen... Gentlemen, we... - You're delusional, my friend. - With your financial support, we are on the precipice of extraordinary change. The possibility of advanced weather prediction could... it could save lives. Gentlemen. Gent... Gentlemen, please! We have to sit through this? Please! "James Glaisher spoke again "this week at the Royal Society of his plans to make a science of the weather." In-in The Times. You read it? Yes, I've read it, Pa. "To the accompaniment of much laughter." - Oh, Arthur, please stop. - They're wrong, by the way. Well, many more thought you were. Well, many didn't believe in Newton. Newton? Oh, James. Newton changed the way we see the Earth and the planets and the stars. You think you can predict... when it might rain. Th-These things that people are saying about you, James, don't-don't... don't they hurt? I wish it didn't hurt you. Time: nine minutes and 23 seconds. Altitude is 5,400 feet. And air temperature is 64 degrees Fahrenheit. Delightful. Could you...? - What? - Just-just at the top. Yeah. You should put on your oilskins, Mr. Glaisher. All right. Out you come. What are you attaching to those pigeons? Our readings. Oh. I see. Reassuring to know you've contemplated our deaths. I've just insured against them, should we not make it back. Cloud ahoy. "What more felicitie can fall to creature "Than to enjoy delight... - with libertie..." - "With libertie, And to be lord of all the workes of Nature." "To raine in th' aire from earth..." "...to the highest skie, To feed on flowres and weeds of glorious feature." "To take what ever thing doth please the eie?" Spenser. "The Fate of the Butterflie." It's one of my favorite poems. Surprising. I didn't have you down as a literary man. Men of science, uh, can enjoy words, Miss Wren. My husband loved that poem. I would have liked to have met your husband. I'm not sure he'd have liked you. Really? He disliked people who studied rather than practiced. Are we still sure this weather will hold? Because my instinct is telling me... Instinct has no place in weather prediction. You're lying to me. Every reading that I took this morning was quite clear, Miss Wren. There are no advantages in concealing concerns. We are trapped here no matter what you say. This pressure is changing faster than I'd anticipated. We're about to get wet. And so it begins. I'm not sure your instruments are much use to us now. We need to batten down, so please put on your wet weather clothing. There are no prizes for obstinacy. James. If you won't listen to me, listen to that. But not one of my readings suggested a storm. Well, that's what it is, and we're inside a cumulo, which is precisely where we shouldn't be. Don't worry. She's not made of conductive material, so we won't attract lightning. And if we are struck, the gas will explode, so we won't live long enough for me to point out... Hold on! Get that equipment put away now! These instruments will give us... Stay still and keep calm. I need to get us out of this. No! No! We cannot descend! This might be our one and only opportunity. - Of course we don't descend. - We don't? There are two ways to break a storm. One is to travel beneath it, the other above it. The safest way is up. The safest way is up? Who did you think you got in a balloon with? Amelia! Amelia! Amelia! Give me your hand! Hold on! Hold on! Take my hand! Take my hand! One! Two! Three! - You all right? - Yes. Hold on! It's not over yet. A lucky escape. Or a brilliant one. May I look through your spyglass, sir? There's nothing to see. I lost them when the storm passed over. I would like a look all the same, sir. I won't steal it. I didn't presume you would. You have an interest in the air? Don't you wish to be up there with them? No, I'd be an unnecessary weight. All the same. Some reach for the stars. Some push others towards them. I wish I was up there. You're not afraid of the clouds? Clouds are just water. Oh. And what of the birds that may attack you? May I look through your spyglass? I can see them, sir. Not possible. I-I can see them, sir. I can. That's my entire body weight. You all right? There we go. Now, that should hold. I hope. Looks pretty precarious to me. She's stronger than she looks. Right. James. James, you'll miss it. That's an aureole. Have you seen one of those before? You haven't? I have in books. I believe you should be checking your instruments. You can't have taken a good reading in quite some time. You so enjoy being amused by me, don't you? I'm amused by your enjoyment of something that has nothing to do with numbers. Have you noticed it's completely silent? Hello...! Cloud ahoy...! Can you hear that? It's a bell. That's bells. Where is that coming from? That's horses. So the humid conditions must be conducting the sound. - We have... - That's the sound of the street. ...flown through a storm, and still London follows us. This high barometer reading's phenomenal. Amelia. Regarde-moi. Amelia. Amelia! Amelia, regarde-moi! Amelia! Amelia, this... Amelia, what's the matter? Are you all right? It'll soon pass. I didn't lock it. No, you did not. You're not dressed. Yet I'm wearing clothes. And when was the last time you changed them? So you break down my door to tell me to wash? When was the last time you opened any curtains? Sunlight ages. I want my furnishings to retain their glow. Which ones are glowing? The ones, uh, with your food upon them or the ones that are covered in your-your dirty clothing? I do not need to see it to know it's there. Well, as much as you might enjoy your self-pity, I'm not here to freshen anything. Phillip has invited us - to a small gathering. - Oh, no, no, no, no. No. Amelia. I do so hate how you say my name. It's like a priest imploring me to confess my sins. It's been two years. Do you really think Pierre would have wanted this? That is beneath even you. I'll help you change. Come. Sisters together. And then I'll let you rot. Mm-hmm. So much easier to claim so with handsome men on one's arm. Yes, uh, certainly. Yes. Oh, please. Mother always taught me, why have one man when you can have two? - Please. - Oh. Be a pleasure to. - Will you excuse me? - Bonny. Come on, then. Your sister's proud as punch she's pulled you here. Hello, Auntie. She keeps trying to persuade men to take you onto the floor. And they refuse her? I think they're intimidated by you. How exciting. Still, hard to be the woman that provokes fear. Are you the Widow Wren? I dislike that title. But you are Miss Wren? Amelia Wren. And who might you be? Glaisher. James Glaisher. It was a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Glaisher. Wh-What brings you here? - Here? - Yeah. The, uh... the selfish needs of a sister. You? The mercenary needs of a friend. Uh, he needed accompanying in his romance. She's apparently worth thousands of pounds a year, so I'm trapped here, just as you are. Well, we needn't trap each other. Miss Wren, sorry, I'm a, I'm a sc-scientist, an astronomer and a meteorologist, and I... A scientist, an astronomer and a what? I believe that the weather can be predicted. Miss Wren, I need to make studies of the air, and I need to be in the air. And I need you to help me. Do you even have a balloon? Not yet, no. - I don't. - So you make an invitation to me, when it is I who should be inviting you? No, I need us... I need you to fly us higher than any man or any woman has ever been. What? Dance with me. Dance with you? Dance with me, and we may converse more. Amelia. Um... Oh. I presume there's a game you're playing here with others in the room. You think I'm trying to make another jealous? You're not that handsome. Every man in this room is petrified to be seen talking to you, let alone dancing with you. No, I imagine your game is with another. - You're clever. - I'm observant. Or presumptuous. And there are certain things, if I may, that I feel safe in presuming about you. Perhaps that you don't have an invitation for tonight's events. Would that be a fair presumption? On what basis do you make that assumption? Your suit is two years out of fashion, your shoes abominable, your dancing ridiculous... I'm leading, you are not... and because this gentleman clearly doesn't know you at all. Oh. Thank you for the dance. I didn't realize that appearances were so important to you, and I'm sorry that I don't live up to this society standard. I don't care what shoes you wear. I care that you're lying to me. It'll be your balloon. All I ask is to be given the freedom to undertake my experiments. I'm not a coachman for hire. Good, because I'm looking for a fellow scientist. To understand the weather, Miss Wren, is to understand how to make ships and sailors safer, farms more productive, so we can prepare ourselves and our world for floods, for droughts, famines. We could save thousands of lives. I want to rewrite the rules of the air, Miss Wren. And I need your help. So, will you... ...help me? Yeah, this seems much more... You're punishing me! I'm not sure a factory full of flammable gases is the safest place for children. You're punishing me for dragging you to that ridiculous evening. No, I am grateful to you for dragging me to that ridiculous evening. I'd not made the acquaintance of Mr. Glaisher otherwise. Now, girls, I believe we have some macaroons somewhere. If that is not proof of you punishing me, - then I do not know what is. - Not here. I hated you going up in the air with Pierre, but why you'd want to go up on your own, I can't even... With Mr. Glaisher. You're my only sister. I do not wish to lose you to any more... foolishness. You'd rather I found a man prepared to marry me to devote myself to. I'd rather you found a way to make yourself happy. You can't just fly away from your problems. You have to face them here, on earth, with the rest of us. Look, Antonia, I am a really good aeronaut, and I want to use what I'm good at. Yeah, but you are a highly accomplished woman. You could be good at so many things. You could have the most beautiful life in society, if only you'd try. And if that isn't what I want? Then you have to learn to want it. Up there, it's where I have found the greatest happiness. He was the happiness, not the damn balloon. Come on, girls. We're going to be late for lunch. So, have you been this high before? Only once. With Pierre? We have time enough. Why don't you tell me about him? Ashamed as I am to not stick to your conversational schedule, I have nothing to tell. - Does your head not hurt? - No. I can't feel it. Sorry, I'm... I didn't mean to... What happened to you, I didn't mean to make light of it. It will heal. You won't have a scar. At this height? Look. Look. He was right. The fool was right. Of all the amazing things. My friend John... John Trew... he made a study of them. So, he theorized, beyond the birds, an air current on which only insects travel, and I never believed him. And I certainly never thought that we would prove him right. Careful. Oh. There she goes. Where are they heading, do you think? Perhaps they trust the wind to decide. He'd have liked these. Pierre. My husband was... the bravest man I knew. He saw possibilities others could not, but... ...his most enduring quality was a deep... and true love for the beauty of the world. Thank you. Others would have pushed me further. Thank you... for not. I cannot quantify what you've lost. No. You can't. Return to your instruments, Mr. Glaisher. I said return to your instruments. I shall. Is she lost? Wren, isn't it? Amelia Wren? I'm looking for James Glaisher. You're very welcome to wait outside while we fetch him to you. You see, we have a policy toward the fairer sex... Then I'll find him myself. Lovely to see you again, Charles. Time, Johnny? 17 seconds. Come on, James. Imagine you're hurtling towards the ground. Hurry, man. Your equipment's gonna be destroyed. Yep. 26 seconds. Well done. And you said I couldn't break 30. - My senses deserted me. - Miss Wren. - This is an honor. - I do not wish to abandon you... - May I give you a tour? - ...but I'm afraid I must. Abandon me? The build is already under way. The largest balloon ever on order. I don't want to climb inside the balloon, Mr. Glaisher. I don't want to climb into a balloon ever again. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, that is not acceptable. A vast amount of money has already been spent. I'm sorry, sir. I have made my decision. Evening, Ma. The wanderer returns. - You were due last week. - Yes, I know I was. Sorry. I've been, uh... I've been having some... Yes, we've been reading all about you in the newspapers. Of all the people, James. Women don't belong in balloons, on show. And she makes such a show of herself. Your reputation risks ruin. Well, you'll be pleased to hear, Ma, that the expedition's off. It was Miss Wren who wouldn't risk flight with me. Is he upstairs? James, his mind's been playing tricks on him again. It's got worse? It comes and goes. Tread carefully with him. Hard at it? - Ethel! Ethel! - Oh, Pa, Pa, it's me. - It's James. - Ethel! Listen, Ma knows I'm here. It's James. I'm your son. You're... M-My son's only ten years old. I got older. Now, what have you been... what have you been looking at here? Oh, get away from that. Pallas? You've been looking at Pallas? Course I'm looking at Pallas. Good spotting. - Here. - Do not pretend that you can see anything through those. These are the glasses I taught you to stargaze through. They're quite sufficient for some work. Your trip. You're going on a trip. In a balloon. Yes, I'm trying to, Pa. Yeah. To see the stars. I hope so. I used to dream of taking my bedsheet, catching a gust of wind and dancing in a parachute among the stars. I know you did. You told me. Mm. Nothing... nothing m-more mysterious, nor more beautiful, than the stars in the sky. Mm. Wh-What are you doing in here? Y-You know the rules. Not in my room. - I-I... - And keep away from that spyglass. It's very valuable, James. I know it is, Pa. I bought it for you. - He's tired. - Oh. Probably best not to overdo it. Thank you, Ethel. Get this lad out of here. Yes, dear. Leave it while you're still on the up. Good night. I will, um... I'll see you next week. James. For your trip. Thank you. Prove them wrong, James. Next week. Mm. Mr. Green? Mr. Green, sir? Sir. If it isn't Mr. Glaisher, the weather sleuth. I believe he prefers to be described as a meteorologist, Charles. Of course he does. Well, best of luck with it. As I'm sure you're aware, sir, I've not been able to attract the funds, either from the Royal Society or elsewhere, that I need to fly. It is an expensive preoccupation. I've heard that you're looking - to make another balloon ascent. - I am. Well, I would like the opportunity to be your second. I will prove a willing accomplice, sir. I have also strong ideas as to how to increase the hydrogen levels in the coal gas that I believe might be your unlocking, and you might finally be able to break that height record. Have you even been in a balloon? I've studied them extensively. Do you have any experience of frostbite, low air pressure, the mind-altering effects of a lack of oxygen to the brain? How else does one learn but by partaking? Exactly what I need in a second: a theorist with no ideas about the true dangers of the air. Find another madman to get in a balloon with. Uh, perhaps the French. Or, better yet, that woman. Good day. 22,200. Do you have faith in these thermometers? 22,400. If so, we're at 21 degrees, and that is cold. 22,500. Well, you can note that temperature down. Hmm. You trust me to write in your book? I am honored. Have we slowed? Are we not at 22,600? Oh, so you are interested. And now we've passed 22,600. - You're insufferable. - You are excited. And that is 22,700. - History will be rewritten. - 22,900. 23,000. We are now higher than any man or any woman has ever been. Thank you for taking me up in your balloon, Mr. Glaisher. Thank you for taking me up in your balloon, Miss Wren. It doesn't feel different at all, does it? On the contrary. This is the moment that I've been waiting for my entire life. I rather suspect I've been waiting for it, too. Right. Now... You still think we might not make it back? I'm just sending a message to Charles Green. 23,900 feet. We're rising even more quickly now. Did you know? Could you tell? It's because the air's thinner. She's expanding. We should think of slowing. So, the air is aiding our ascent. Isn't that outstanding? Surely, now is the time to put your oilskins on. Didn't bring any oilskins. They proved extremely heavy. I told you that you needed oilskins. Well, the equipment was essential. The weight limit was essential. If I'm to get a little sick returning... A little sick? You-you carry four thermometers, you carry this strange box, but you-you couldn't bring suitable clothing - for the cold and the wet? - Keep moving. Don't stop. The cold will only catch you if you let it. We need to go down now. Wait. No, no, we're not descending. Not yet. The best way to break a storm is to travel up. I quote you, dear lady. Well, maybe the best way to break a cold is also to travel up. And which science are you basing that upon? The science that says, with every layer of air, we are traveling into an unknown. So, with every layer of air, we are traveling - closer to the sun. - I believe we have already accomplished... So these findings that I am still to discover, - they could be overwhelming. - You are freezing. - Please. What have we to lose? - Our lives. This could be more important than our lives! Please. I know that you want this as much as I do. I'm descending. Stop. No. So, this balloon has defied every single thing that we have thrown at it. This is not about the balloon. This is not about science. This is about your war with those who lord it over you. And I have fought them, too. - This is, this is not... - I... This is, this is about that. Look at it. There's nothing more beautiful, nor more mysterious, than the stars in the sky. And look at us. We are dancing amongst them. You wanted that writing on the balloon, Amelia. "Caelum certe... - patet, ibimus illi." - "Patet, ibimus illi." "Surely, the sky lies open. Let us go that way." The sky is open. It is open. Now, you understand there will come a time when we go no further? Yes, I do. Do you understand that decision will only be mine? Yes, I do. Thank you. Tell me when we land if I deserve your thanks. You deserve my thanks. Good evening, Miss Wren. I've made my decision, Mr. Trew. And I understand that. I just wanted to gift you this book. These are beautiful. They're pictures of snowflake formations. A study of the mathematical possibilities of nature, a study undertaken by James... James Glaisher. He believes the sky can be understood. Of this I am well aware. He is, sadly, occasionally wrong. He predicted it would snow tonight, would you believe. But more often than not, he finds remarkable truths. Travel with him, and you will discover this. - I have. - I'm sorry. I... I-I clearly told him no. He should not have sent you to convince me. He didn't send me. He'd consider me a poor persuader. - I'm here on my own account. - You will not dissuade me - from my path, Mr. Trew. - James believes there's something extraordinary up there. And so this is an opportunity I should not miss? You misunderstand me. It's not an opportunity but an obligation. In this life, few are given the chance to change the world. You've been assigned a responsibility, Miss Wren. You have to meet it. Enjoy the book, madam. - Height? - Height, height. - Mm. - 26,500 feet. 26... And temperature? And temperature... - five degrees Fahrenheit. - Five. It's the strangest thing. So, the higher that we fly, the lower the humidity. There's barely any water vapor here at all. There is still ice. These temperatures, they're unprecedented. These are freezing ranges that no one would have predicted. Yeah. And what was that temperature? Um, five degrees. Five... Oh, come on. Right. Out you come. No concern necessary. We have another. We don't have another. What are you doing? - Losing weight. - L-Losing weight? A mere consequence of the decrease in air pressure. This-this balloon isn't safe, James. And much more severe than I'd anticipated. James, the-the pressure on the material could lead - to rips, and at... - The coal gas has expanded, and... ...this altitude, these-these rips could definitely be fatal. What are you doing?! We can't lose more weight! No! Give me the sandbag! It is time we descend. I will not stop because you can't withstand a little pressure. Don't you see what's happening? James, the lack of oxygen is affecting your brain. We're going to die unless we descend now. Your husband risked your life for his own recklessness. I do the same, but for science. You know nothing of my husband's death. It is well known that he pushed harder than he should have. Now imagine that story again, and imagine this time that I am the pilot... ...that h-he told me to stop, that I-I was risking the balloon. How bad is the tear?! The seams ripped apart. I... I fought... too hard for my place at the table. We're falling too fast. We're going to die here! We need to lose more weight! Come on. There must be something. Think. Think. - Yes. Yes. - Think. Thank you for giving me somewhere I belonged. Keep looking up. No! Pierre! No! Amelia. I'm so sorry. Do not... be responsible... for the death of another. It's one mistake you'll never forgive yourself for. I'm so sorry. Really, I am. Now... ...let's get this balloon down. Yes. I think... I-I think we've... discovered that oxygen is... Open, damn it. Open. Come on! Come on! Come on! James. James. - You have to keep moving. - Yes. You... If you lay still, then-then the hypoxia will set in. The gas release valve is frozen. I... I need to climb up and open it. Stay alive. Stay alive. Stay alive. Amelia. Amelia. Regarde-moi. Thank you... ...for giving me somewhere I belonged. - Should we have heard anything by now? - No. We'll only hear if there's a disaster. The less we hear, the... better her chances. - Then we pray for silence? - Yes. Pray for silence. Still no sign of them. Oh, God. James! Come on. Oh, God. Come on. James! Come on. Come on. Come on. James. James. James. James. James. James, we've survived. We're going down. James. James, James. James. James? We're going down. I can't have this happen again. James. Your strange two-tube device is doing something very peculiar, you know. You're meaning my hygrometer. It's bubbling. Could that not be significant? It could. We're descending. We are. I've been... insensible. You have. And I think I lost my head. It does seem that way. Well, come on, then. Time: one hour, 11 minutes and 19 seconds. Height? 28,600 feet. And temperature? Unknown. That equipment's been lost to us. And my hygrometer's had better days. This is of no great use, either. Our readings on the descent shall be less significant. Oh, your hands. So, you didn't have room for oils, but you did for brandy? Well, a scientist is nothing without his equipment. Hold out your hands. What are you gonna do? This is gonna hurt a bit. I'm sorry, but you need to hold them out. I know. That hurt. - Is that, uh, any better? - No. Worse. I don't know what you did for me up there, but I have no doubt that it was a great act. - Your poor hands. - Look. And now snow. Oh. As if we haven't had enough. It'll pass. It's possibly interesting to analyze the melt water. My sister wanted to know why I would ever go up in a balloon again. I think it was because I wanted... all that I knew, all that he taught me... ...all that I've lost to be for something. Well... I need to make sense of all of this before I can work out quite what we've achieved, but it, uh... it seems that the atmosphere has levels to it. - That's-that's not what I mean. - It has patterns within it. Newton said that we build too many walls - and not enough bridges. - I don't want to hear from Newton. I want to hear from you. All my life, I've found comfort in science. It helps give meaning to the many things we can't control. It brings a degree of order to the... chaos that surrounds us. But whilst we may be able to explain the science behind an aureole or the falling snow... ...it's not possible to account for its beauty. Together... we've brought the stars closer. We have brought the stars closer. Do you notice something about the snow? It's not falling. It's hovering. It's static. Strange. What might be... We might, if we were traveling at the same speed as it. The same speed as snow? The gas, it's still escaping. Combined with the decrease in pressure, it means... That the balloon's collapsing. Quick, help me! Pull! Pull! - What on earth was that? - My shoe. Probably best not to question it. But if your shoe was up there, that means that... Maybe we save the thanks for later. We need to lose weight. A lot of weight. Now! Come on. The chest! The chest! I'll do it. One, two. We should lose our jackets. My hands. Help me. Yeah. I'll do it. Come on! It's not working, Amelia! It's not working! Climb into the hoop. - What? - Amelia, climb into the hoop! We need to lose the basket! It's the heaviest weight! Come on! Quick! Come on! That's it! Come on! One more! Hold on! It's not enough! - We're still too fast. - It will be enough. Amelia? Amelia, what are you doing? I'm not sure I was meant to survive this. Amelia, no! Get back down! Amelia! Amelia! Bedsheets. Amelia, bedsheets! We sever the cord keeping the balloon in shape, and then the silk will be pulled up into the netting and act as a parachute. - It's not going to work! - It will work! I'm not returning alone. Amelia, I'm not returning alone. It's either both of us or neither of us. Hold on! We hold on! Whoa! It worked! It worked! It's not over yet. James! James! James! James! James! Amelia? James! - James! - Amelia, I'm coming! James! - James! - Amelia! James. Amelia! James. I was just coming to find you. Not very quickly, it seems. Can you stand? I'd rather not. And if I help you? Then I would stand. It was estimated that we rose to a height of 37,000 feet that day. Seven miles high. "Two aeronauts "have been nearer to the Moon and stars than all the race of man before them." The Times, Ethel. You read it? Yes, Arthur, I've read it. My boy. James Glaisher's meticulous recording of data showed that the atmosphere has different layers within it, a discovery which led to the first scientific weather forecasts. The fact that I am able to be here at all to present this to you is due to some luck, some help... ...and Amelia Wren's remarkable courage. So, we tell our story not for the purposes of pleasure but for the advancement of knowledge... ...and for the good of us all. We took to the skies in the name of discovery, to find something new, to change the world. Come on! I've flown in worse weather than this! We'll make pilots of you yet. We won't. But you don't change the world simply by looking at it. You change it through the way you choose to live in it. Look up. The sky lies open.
