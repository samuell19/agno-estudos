Subbed by AP. Hope you enjoy! I translated this by listening. Some parts might be wrong because I couldn't hear them well. Please comment me if you find any mistake(s). I will be very thankful. In the film "Breakfast at Tiffany's", Audrey Hepburn escaped from a bad country and came to New York to live a happy life. She and her handsome husband carried a kitten in the rain. It's an unbelievable happy ending. Even though, I am touched every time I see it. Wait a minute. A girl who ran away from rural life Can she find a place and live happily in a big city? This makes me rather doubt it. The next is the last one for today. That.... I have ordered three interviews tomorrow. Then Ramen Special will be finished. I'm glad. The last one Dessert Special is better. Your article is well-written. Thank you for the compliment. Don't be humble. That friend? Have you contacted them after moving here? No, just one. Which one? There is a nice girl in middle school. We are very happy to meet after a long time. We got contact from Facebook with the boy we used to like. Then? I don't know how that happened, by the way, we made an appointment to meet him. Really? Yes. I have to go too. Why did you say that? It will be okay. Do you want to take a look? Take a photo, please. Ok Are there popular dishes among customers? Our restaurant's miso ramen is very popular. Suga is, especially for local magazines, a freelance photographer with more than 10 years of work experience. (Little More:Japan Publishing House) Even though he is 40 years old now, he still wants to let Little More out of this photo collection. Or he said that the vines will die. I'm surprised that people who are married and have children still say something. But I always felt a little sympathetic. I am digging in. Very hot. It's delicious. Very delicious. What about innards? Have you not eaten? Wanna give? Ok Thank you You've worked hard. Hey, how about your friend? Sorry for suddenly being like this. I am really very sorry. It's okay, it feels very interesting, so I don't need to drive. But I have to tell you at least ... It is okay. Hello Nice to meet you. This is my friend, Satsuki. I am Satsuki. This is Suga. Suga. Please take care of me. Come in the car. Sorry, can you sit in the back? Of course, I can. Come in please. Excuse me. Thank you. Sorry, the space is a bit narrow. Okay? Fasten your seat belt. Yes. Let's go... Please Please I feel that this city is not breathing. It exudes rural air. Why did Suga go to Tokyo? I went for photography. So it is for your dream. Umm.. yes, can be said like that. Isn't it you? Famous freelance photographer. Yes, I dedicated to local magazines. You also busy with supermarket leaflets photos. Don't talk about it. As freelance writer, you're not trained well. I read your article that introduced a cake shop. Thank you. Why did you come back? Because of the earthquake? I've been in Tokyo for 10 years and that's enough. Even if there isn't an earthquake, I think I'll return. But if you marry a native of Tokyo, you will not return. Certainly. I haven't fully returned. What do you mean? My soul is still roaming around Koenji Temple. Really? I also want to go to Tokyo. You can leave right now. Now, what can I do? It makes no sense to be young. I think it makes no sense to be young. Yes, but it feels like living here is more safe. Go to Tokyo to pursue your dreams Those can give meaning to life, right? Of course How do you say it? Sure enough, I still have dreams in Tokyo. There is nothing here. I did not find my dream in Tokyo. Really? Well, I don't know what it's like to get into it. But you have been there for 10 years. What did you do in Tokyo? I work part time job. Resign and find a job. Resign and work part time again. My girlfriend left home due to depression. Oh, please stop talking about it. Very cool. Which part of it is cool? I always felt there was loneliness in a big city. There is such a handsome one that can't be displayed without going to Tokyo. If there is no stable job here, my boyfriend is still experiencing depression. That's a big problem. I'm sure I can't talk about it so calmly. I was very scared when those things happened. No, I mean the people around. There are many people around here. I see. Sure enough, this kind of thing in Tokyo will follow the wind. Everyone won't pay too much attention to you. Did you misunderstand a little about Tokyo, Satsuki? Even in Tokyo, there are many things left behind. Nobody remembers even after 10 years of falling apart. That place is only Tokyo. If it's not comfortable here, There will always be people who will tell you about this. "It's very difficult to do it." you will hear that kind of stupid things I see. Even if you can live without stability, you will only have Tokyo. So what happened to the boy's name? Shiina His name is super cool. There was also the soccer team. Although he is not a bad boy, he fought with bad boys. What else? That one... Relay race at sports competition. He was last and final departure but he won. Is he very awesome? Because he is fast and popular, he will go to high school. When we were in school, we were in the same class. Then the girls from other classes will always go to the corridor to take a peek. That makes me have a feeling of superiority. What? Why is there a sense of superiority, Satsuki? Because ... The fact that we are in the same class sounds awesome. I was a member of the corridor forces until I was a sophomore. I really understand their feelings. There is a feeling of "sorry, thank you" But What if he changes completely? What has completely changed? For example, he becomes bald and very fat. Even if it's not that or very bad Shiina won't be like that, he never will. We are still not 30 years old. Who knows. Nami teacher, listen to me. Today, I said at school that you gave me school lessons at home. Everyone feels strange. I usually tutor at students' homes. Because of the family environment, I cannot concentrate on learning. The noise can never stop. It's as noisy as the Vietnamese market. Even though I've never been to Vietnam.. Study at night, then.. Will you? At night, my brother ran around and was very noisy. I wondered how active he was. Go to school to participate in club activities during the day. How is he still so active at night? Middle school students are like that. So every time I go to the teacher's house, I feel it,... It is here. The place that can make me progress is here. Thank you for your compliment. What? How was school? Enjoyable? I think so. Is that so? Yes. Be it bad or not bad. It feels very common. It's fun to play with friends. I don't have many friends to enjoy with. Is that so? Yes, even if I want to watch a movie and tell my friends They will say that they were not interested. So I finally went to watch a movie that everyone wanted to watch. If you want to watch a movie, can't you see it yourself? I still can't watch the movie alone myself. Why? I can go to the zoo if there is something. Why are you talking lies? Is it enjoyable to go alone? Enjoyable. You've worked hard. You've worked hard. How is your part time work? Nothing special. If you're hungry, right? What are we going to eat? I can't. I have to go home today. If you have something, you can say no, how do I know what you think? If you know that you didn't go out to eat, I wouldn't have picked you up. Endo Yes? You have to run and wait for me. Your tone of speech is exactly the same as Shiina Did he just contact you? How about you? I don't know his telephone number. Really? I don't know if he is still in Osaka. I don't know. Maybe he will come back here? He is not the type of person who can live in a big city all the time. Anyway, even if the work is uncertain, move on. That's too impulsive. I think he will definitely come back. I'll bet you. Let's go? What to do when eating? Even today. (Apple Green Family Restaurant) I'm really annoyed to say that there is another wedding next week. At least someone ask you to come. Since I have no friends, I don't have things like that. You should thank for it.. I have to pay money. I do not work for this kinds of stuff. Too bad, you. Akane, do you want to get married? Of course I want to. Do you want? I definitely want to Every day I feel that I'm wearing a wedding dress. It's getting worse. Also forced to marry by people around me. After all, it's like that. Welcome, two person right? Come here. In my words, everyone thought I would work in a big city. The result is half way I am also old, they will feel that I'm pathetic. I see. Really, if you have a boyfriend, you can do it. You have a beautiful face so why doesn't anyone want it? We want two buffet drinks. Yes, please use the counter there. The impression is bad, right? Impression? They will not search my name in Google. Morishige Akane So the first thing in a keyword search is that women are free to be picky. What is that? It is not allowed. Even though I look like this for the first time, when I was 21 years old. At that time, idols were not virgins. Manager say to me every day. Don't do it with anyone, don't do it with anyone. As a result, I was with this manager for the first time. This story is very interesting. Where's the fun? Free sex is not popular, and free sex is not like men. Yes But when I returned, I am not promiscuous. Men like that are the most annoying. That is a woman who is picky. So I want to get married and get rid of this flood of impressions and heavy pressure. Live a stable life I am very happy now. Can't be like that. Just like this, work and go to the family restaurant after work. If we live like this, we will rot. Maybe so. But I have no plans to get married. What? Should I just order pork cutlet? Pork cutlet is rare. Then I'll order a cheese burger and order it. What will you order? I want pork cutlet set. And also a cheese burger. Yes. All great. Excuse me. Yes One rice He remembers us. Awesome Can I smoke in the car? Open the window. Ok My wife will scold me. Here Sorry Satsuki Yes What do you do for work? Household stuff. I worked as a gardener's assistant at a wedding a while ago. Is that so? Right I don't need to spend money to live in my own house. So no need to be embarrassed. I think so too Are you two out together? No, this is the second time today. Because I just moved back here, right? Is that so? - I think ... - You two? Do you two always work together? Cannot say always but it's quite a lot. Yes There are not many people. Very good. I also want to go to Tokyo. There is nothing good there. What? It's cool. This is a line that only the people who have experienced it can say. There The game centre there. Remember that? Thank you It's still the same. Really.. We will be late. We will just look for a little while. It's nostalgic, the pool table is still here. This is nostalgic. This is what I played in my school days. Come on Ah What happened? No It is ... Yes What is the name? That Are you Shinpo? Remember us? Class in middle school. Shinpo, right? Long time no see Long time no see Do you keep staying here? No, I returned to my hometown. I was always in Tokyo. That's very awesome. I haven't been here since graduating. We also didn't come after middle school. At that time, I often played with Shiina. Shinpo too Although not with everyone, this place is good. Is that so? Shiina, he is the manager here. When? When I was senior in university, he returned from Osaka. I have no idea at all. I heard that he is now a driving school coach. That's the work that I introduced to him. Is that so? He seemed to blame himself a little at that moment. Also tell what else a host must do I have found a lot of recruitment information. Then I let him choose So, it looks like he's fine. Are you so good with Shiina? No, I'm unemployed, nobody's coming here. Shiina, he works here but hates this job. We both reunited at that time. So for a while, the relationship wasn't bad. I see. In the worst conditions, I met someone I know. I will unconsciously approach him. Why did Shiina come back? Maybe because everything is no longer smooth. He has been treated as a male god. Have you seen Shiina recently? No I had never seen him since he quit his job. We will go to see Shiina Right? Um, are you coming too? No Is there something you want us to bring to him? Don't tell him that you saw me here. Why? We are already late. Yes I don't want him to think that I'm still here. See you, Shinpo. Yes. Why is it called Yuko? What? The name you use when playing games is Yuko. Because I am great child (yuuko). What is that? See you later (Yuko) Dear Father Pan And other gods come here. Please give me an inner soul and beauty. Then let the outside align with the inside. What are you doing? I'm talking about something very important. Sorry, what did you say? (Namba bridge:This Osaka Bridge is called a holy place) So wouldn't that be Namba bridge? Even if we go to the bridge, no one will take care of us. Then let's go and talk to the girls that only we can talk to. What do you mean? That's why I told you.. Shinpo (They are calling Chinpo) Chinpo, you are called chicken. Shiina What are you calling like that? Shinpo Look at that chicken. Chicken Don't say that. Say, it's fine. Why can't you say it? You are awesome What? Don't peek at him. I feel very happy. Then the past is over. Chicken, take the ball. Chicken. Are you deaf, chicken? Shinpo Yes. Don't bully chicken. What do you mean by this? Chicken is not used for bluffing. Tell me why you don't change clothes. I have to go back. - Oh, that's not too comfortable. Are you lazy? See you later. Chicken, are you not hungry? Do you want to go to Start? Why? Because I'm hungry. Do you want to go to Start? Go, let's go Run Let's go for carbonated drinks Right. Help me carry it. I am very hungry. Burgers set with cola drinks. Cola burger set Yes - Two sets - Two sets A total of 800 yen - How will you checkout? We will pay together Pay together I will accept you 1000 yen. 200 yen for you. Pickles. What happened? What are your plans after graduating? Nothing to do. Is that so? How about you? I'm going to college Your are very smart. Do you have a job that you want to do? Nothing, look at that. If you do work that you don't like, you will hate yourself. But this generation is bad, right? The government does not do it for the country. What do you mean? In some countries, low wages make many offers. The unemployed young Japanese are happy to work cheaply. Sorry You are really smart. I will find something to do. You will definitely succeed, no matter what you do. Shiina I haven't seen it in a long time. Who's that? Are you fine? Very good Very rare What is rare. You are polite, huh? Hey, look look. I'm driving. Can I touch your head? Wait a minute -Why? What is it? I'm driving. Don't do that. It is dangerous. What do you want to do? Just applying hand cream What is that? Are you still happy at school? Everyone looks so happy. Then what about you? Maybe it's okay, but Of course, these are students. Don't do it. It's dangerous. I will make you not move. You have fun at school. Not at school why? I don't understand but the school was not a pleasant place. People around you are like children to you. You're more mature. If you are going to cause trouble with your child, what do you want to do? You will feel stupid hating yourself. There is a boy in my class named Shiina He is very popular Always be the center of everyone There will always be someone like that The area around Shiina is always very crowded The others want to enter the circle too. Like the solar system formed by the center of Shiina They argue there every day. Isn't that awesome? But I'm not at all interested. Because you think they are all children. Maybe But I am also a child. Do you want to see No Want to see? No, no. Listen, let me drive. Why? Let me drive. This time Use this formula I see. Correct Correct? Good Let's rest. Where is this photo album sold? There is definitely no bookshop near here. If you like this kind of thing, why not go to Tokyo? You will definitely enjoy. What happened? I talked to my father before, and my father was very much against it. Is that so? Same with me. I also want to go to university in Tokyo. My father was really against it and I would not return when I left. But If I really want to leave, I'll leave even if my parents object. I still haven't decided at that time. I think so now. Don't you regret it? I deeply regret my dream now. I have to go to university in Tokyo. I don't want to live in a rural place like this. Then if you live in a university in Tokyo, if you live alone. I will find you, is that okay? Of course, you have to come. I'm digging in. Delicious. I'm digging in. Asako? Good morning. Please What is this? How do you open it? For Shiina. Can't you give it yourself? How can I do it? You don't know how many people are chasing him. If I am seen by senior classmates, they will laugh at me. Where do you like my brother? Where is it? I want to talk to him, I want Asako to help me. However, please give this to him. Please I have to wear short sleeves today. Shiina That girl is bothering him. Are they dating? Who knows. Asako What? What happened to you? What? Why did you come to this building? You care about me? Didn't you come to me? She looks like you. - Is that so? We are not alike. My mother, my father, everyone is very similar. This is strange. - What? Love letter You don't have a girlfriend, right?. Yes. Bye. To Shiina Senpai What you're laughing at? Excuse me, this is your order for pizza and drinks. - Ok, thank you. Pizza came. Okay - I put it here - OK. Wear it quickly. I'm digging in. This one. I don't want. You eat half. Is this delicious? Yes delicious. Right? Eat Stop. Delicious Yes delicious. Delicious It's delicious Hawaii is very fun. Excuse me - This is for you Thank you. I've been there several times while working in Tokyo. Because it's business class, it's always very high pressure. But if you marry that boss You don't know when their own insurance company will go bankrupt. They are still looking for civil servants Even if the company is down, but the family has money, don't worry. You say that, don't let him hear it. I was kidding about it. It is interesting to say that people involved in risky work are very attractive. Very strong. That is, he is too old and bald. Is that so? However, I also returned to work here and got money. So you have to hurry and find a boyfriend. Work uniforms and pajamas are changed every day. People will only become more relaxed I'm glad. I don't want you to be like that before. What are you saying? You have to try it too. Try, Try , Try hard. I will try my best. I find something interesting when I organized the room. Sorry, the insurance. Hello, I am with my friends at the restaurant now. Look at this, this is Morishige Akane. This girl is the same age as us. Is that so? - She is still attending the middle school? Awesome. Of course, she was extraordinary, but she was confused. She has achievements today and everything is in the future. Listen to me, listen to me. "It's okay for me to be a free woman for life." Is this really amazing? I can only say this when I go to Tokyo. Do you want to go to the game centre? Go to the game centre? I go - Hurry up! Chasing and chasing. - Come on, quickly. Very cool here, hot outside. Very nervous. Let's go. He is very cool. You're a little over, Satsuki. I know it. Have you played billiards? Good, good Very good Put the ball in here. Straight ahead Focus on Look at your range This one This one It's in. It's in again. The next ball is straight ahead. It's in. What are you looking? Do you want to try? But I'll teach you, come. You stand here. -Shiina Hi HI. Three fingers support the ball into the ball. I do not understand. What? Three fingers support Right. Very nice. Thank you Here- Can I? Thank you Do you often come to play? Well, there is another place and here. Is that so? This is my first time. The next turn is Shiina's turn, your turn. I am taking a break, What will you do after graduation? I haven't thought about it Me too. I just have to decide quickly. Do you have something you want to do? Want to work. Anything will do. What do you mean? What do you want to do? I want to be a middle school student all the time. What is so funny? Activities after school are very common for them But for us that was irreplaceable special memory. This was a happy time that only Shiina could carry. Have you ever had a relationship with Shiina? That's why I am glad, right? Very lucky When can I become a character? I want to go back to when we are students. If the money could be returned, I might have paid it. If it were me, I would go back to Koenji Temple. I never thought about that at the time. This is middle school here. Nostalgic. Come and take a photo. I took it, oh. Come and take a photo. Let's take a photo. One two Three How are you? Study hard, okay? Study hard This... Sorry, I saw it here. Is this interesting like a celebrity quote? This is a collection of famous celebrities. You like reading these books. Sorry, I'm leaving. Hey Are you dating with Shiina? No I thought you were a couple. We are not dating. Is that so? Why do you ask? Nothing, sorry. It looks like that. No He is always everyone's focus. We are always subconsciously paying attention. I feel like you two are dating. Sorry We are not dating. Sorry But if it looks good, that's good. What? At least in your eyes, I'm Shiina's girlfriend, right? Even though I see like this Yeah, just look at us like that. When will I see you again? Still don't know. Maybe not next time. What? The family arranged a blind date for me. If you succeed, you plan to marry each other. I'm 47 years old. Everyone around me whispers in my ear every day. There are still people who are dating. Yes, it is true. How many people? I also think that there are still people who are dating. Uh Speaking of which, you are 47. Yes yes I'm 47 years old. Goodbye Can't see it? What are you looking at again? What is this? Endo is a little faster Still not working. No It hurts. I let you end it idiot.. I am coming. I only smoke right after I'm done. This is nothing. Tell me if I'm a man, It was said by the woman that it would end soon. Maybe because I have no pride. I still have right? No Still have something, don't say that.. Men are made of self-esteem and romance. Is that so? Yes Shiina too. What do you think? How do you have pride? There is no face and no understanding. I am very happy. What? So I don't need to care about your ex-boyfriend, right? - Endo - um? I feel sad when I see you. - Therefore I don't want you to mention past things. This is all before. Is this interesting? But I still have to tell you clearly. Don't treat yourself as my boyfriend.. Shiina is the only name of my boyfriend I am dating. You're only Endo. This is my answer. I liked you since you were with Shiina Is that so? Thank you very much. But no matter what time or now, I'm not interested in you. Hello, I want pizza and cola. You haven't eaten yet. Of course I have to eat. What are you doing? If you don't have a car here, where do you want to go? Let's take a SIM. Aren't you doing it? Then, if I'm not around, can't you go anywhere? If there is something you don't need if I am here, what is it? No. No.. is bad. This time you must say, as long as you have other things, I don't need them. It is impossible for someone to not have anything because of someone's existence. You can't judge like this. Maybe I'll be all of you. Wait until that time, wherever I go, you will chase me running. Are you waiting? It serves you well. If I go somewhere, will you still chase me? Yes, even if it is the end of the earth, I will follow you. Isn't it more comfortable if you have a car? No, no No, no, no. Anyone? Anyone is okay. What are you doing here? What? What are you doing here? I do not understand. Is there no car? Why are you walking? Well, no car, I can only run Why is there no car? This time it was very strange to walk here. Are you not walking, what are you doing? Why is there no car? Why why Hey Hey, not like this, right? I'm on behalf of Shiina This is different from Endo. See the sunset at dusk Past events come to mind Morning Sunday morning The road is empty Just drop me off See the sunset at dusk Past events come to mind At that time, your smile was by my side And sadness that cannot be suppressed In your little eyes Rain is falling How can you not forget? These thoughts cling See the sunset at dusk Past events come to mind What are you doing? I still like him. I know. Get on the car. Really, you have no pride. Endo Ah? Lend me some money. I'll test my license. I really can't stand my sister. It's too annoying to keep calling me not to be like this. Is that so? It's no use complaining to my husband. When I'm with my relatives, they always ask if I will have children. Tell him that it's not done yet. We haven't done it yet, how can we get it? Aren't you doing it? No, I can't stand the feeling of the old man on his body. What is strange is that you don't do anything, isn't it? Uh, is it so? I do not know How do you see me now? Do you think my life is too boring? You are okay. Really? Yes. It's okay to be boring. But I do not want to be like this. I will always be there for you. Minami Are you still okay with your boyfriend? Just like that. Your boyfriend is a driving school coach. Yes Introduce me to him next. I can but he is not my boyfriend What? Are you kidding? What, now, tell me now. I'm now Shiina Minami. When is it? Recently, almost two months ago What kind of person is he? What kind of person? Boring man. Oh I'll be there soon. I am very nervous. What will you do after seeing Shiina, Satsuki? Ah? There is nothing special about it. What is the plan for this? We have no the plan, right? Aren't you nervous? Not really nervous but. How is her feeling now? Just like this Are there men like Shiina in Tokyo? No Maybe there is no place. What? Ah? Nothing. After crossing this bridge, it is a driving school. Terrible, I want to pee. Be calm, Satsuki. Do you see if it's there? Like in middle school. Are you disturbed? It's annoying. Hello, this way. Shinpo, have you thought about the future? I've thought a lot. What do you want to achieve the most? I want to live with the person I like. It's not helpful to think about things that can't be realized. Shiina's girlfriend You must be jealous of many people. Even if I live a boring life How can Shiina's girlfriend's life be boring? Feel young? Is that okay? Okay What you're laughing at? Are we leaving? No You were the manager in the game centre. How do you know? Shinpo told me. Still the job he introduced me to? Well, he also told me about it. If there isn't him, I might die early. Then, he is your great benefactor. Yes I might be a tool that drives your destiny to work. Or a guide in your life journey. Do you want to do the driving school topic? Tell me about driving school Shiina sensei Yes. - I need to go - um. It's a little difficult. What? I can't remember it. What? What is your name? Sorry, sorry, I really don't remember. What is my name? Yes I The passion that I have conveyed to you I am very ashamed now. People with distant mountains will climb alone I want to stop now and want to laugh. People with distant mountains will climb alone I want to stop now and want to laugh. Humans always practice exclusivism for things that are valuable. I want to stop now and want to laugh.
