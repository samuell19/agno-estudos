(clicks) - Why are you so fixated on Terry? He's straight. - Where do you get your information? - That guy is not a fag. (instant message alerts) (instant message pops up) - He's in Billing. He has no reason to come down here and use our copier, except to flirt with you. You're what, 34, and you've never had a boyfriend? Maybe it's time. - I've had a boyfriend. - For more than three weeks? - You know how hard it is to meet people. - Not really. - I should just walk up to the next guy that I see and ask him out, "Hey, let's go to dinner." - Yeah, you should do that. Walk up to the next guy, the next gay guy, and just ask him out, why not? - Why don't you try it? - I don't date gay guys. - Any more. - Straight guys are different. If I walked up to some random straight guy and asked him out, he'd either be married, or only like big tits, or we'd sleep together and I would never hear from him again. - Straight guys aren't different. - Ok, Tony, this is you. And this is Jôrge and that's Tina. - Hi, Tony. - So you'll come right back here after the DOSAT training. - See you later. (instant message alerts) (instant message pops up) (instant message pops up) (instant message pops up) - I know! - I am not going to sleep with someone from work. - You always have to find something wrong. - I'm finally happy. Things are going well. Why would I screw things up by dating, especially dating somebody from work? - What about Terry? - He works two floors down. And he's rumored to be straight. - Are you eating here today? - Yeah, now good? - I'll have the pasta with cream sauce, please. - Dolores, why don't you get the Princess some cream sauce? - Here you go, Madame. - Spaghetti and meat sauce, please. - Garlic bread or breadstick, dear? - Do you see anything in the sun? Oh, there's one over here. - Hello, Ellen. - Hey. - They didn't give me any broccoli. - Hey. - Oh, hey, I'm just finishing up. - No problem, we have time. - You know, I don't think I'm up for it tonight. - Oh, not this again. - Look, it's been a long day and I'm tired. Plus I feel kind of weird going out without Pam, she's-- - Are you depressed? Or do you just not wanna be my friend anymore? - Christ, I just, I'm just tired. - I'm tired too, really? And you paid for the tickets, I don't give a shit. To be honest, I wasn't looking forward to it. - Seriously? - Eh. It's hard to pull ourselves out of these ruts. - Look, I'm not in a rut. I got so much going on right now. I just can't go to a show whenever I want. - Then why'd you buy the tickets? - I need to finish this up and get home. - Can I have your ticket? - Who'd you go with? - I'll find someone. - Who? Oh, why don't you ask Terry? - Or maybe I'll just go home and take a bath but at least I'll have the choice. - Good evening, how are you tonight? - Good, thanks, you? - Great, thank you. Do you need anything else? - Do you have anything for oily skin? I've been breaking out a bit lately. - Maybe a toner, maybe a mask. - A mask sounds good. Something not too drying. - This one is divine. It'll make your face cool and tingly without making your skin tight like a doll. - Okay, sure. - Are you a member of our shopper club? - No. - Is it your birthday? Do you wanna sign up for the club? You'll get monthly member emails and 20% off your next purchase, and a lot of great deals throughout the year. - No, thanks. - You want a free tote for the lady in your life? - No, thanks. There's no lady in my life. - There you are, have a good night. - Thanks, you, too. Um, are you, would you maybe wanna go see a show tonight? I just happen to have an extra ticket for-- - Oh, I'm not gay. - What do you mean? - I mean, I like women. A lot. - Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Have a good night. (slow piano music) (baby crying) - She is so cute. - Oh, she is, she's amazing. - Is she down for the night? - It depends on how late we're up but she's probably got another six hours in her. - So, when are you coming back? - I don't know. I don't know. - Don't know or don't know that you will? - I don't know. Would you like something to drink? - Is that cider? - Yes. - Hi. - This is Larry. - Jôrge, hi. - Hi, how are you? - Do you two know each other? - Yeah, we met at the coffee shop a few months back. - Yeah. - Pam was there. - It is such a small town. Cider. And Meghan will be here soon. She left the shop ten minutes ago. - How do you know Meghan? - Through Pam, and I don't. I love her coffee. They have great coffee. - [Pam] It really is good coffee. - [Larry] And the pastries, the pastries are so good. - What's for dinner? - Steaks and salmon for the grill. - So how do you two know each other again? - We met at the shop a few months back. - Oh, yeah. (lightly laughs) - What? (doorbell rings) - I'll get it. (doorbell rings) - It's supposed to rain tomorrow but it'd be nice on Sunday. - So, how have you been? - I've been good. - I haven't seen you at coffee lately. - Yeah, it's been busy at work lately. I've been trying to cut back. - Meghan charges you for coffee? - Megs! - Have you seen her lately? - No. She's... she doesn't know what she wants. I've just been hanging out. The shop's taking up all my time. But it's good, I'm good. - You need to get someone to help you manage that place. How are you gonna manage everything? I can't imagine. - Yeah. - Do you want to be seeing anyone? - No. No, I'm done. I'm just sick of crazy ladies. She seems so nice and sweet, and then, what happened? Who does something like that? - You do know how to pick 'em. How do you feel about blondes? - No. No, don't set me up with anyone. - [Glen] I think this might work out. - [Pam] What do you mean? - (chuckles) Your setup. - (laughs) What setup? - Please, Larry? (chuckles) You're good. Oh, my god. - Oh, my god. I think I'm gonna go home. - What? - Oh, Megs! - No, the wine seems to have done its trick. It's been a long day. I swear, he doesn't even try. He could get laid at a Promise Keepers convention. - Why, you want me to set you up with a guy? - You know what I mean. - What did you do? - What did you do? (door squeaks) - I forgot a movie. - You forgot your movie. - Thanks. - I was gonna put it in the office. - Have a good night. - Stay warm out there. (door squeaks) - Pam should set me up with someone. - Pam doesn't set people up. - It seems to have worked out ok this time. - Yeah, we'll see. - Oh, that's nice. - What's that? - We have farm-raised salmon today, lots of vitamin D for your baby. - What? - When are you due? It's so exciting. - I'm not pregnant. - Oh, how embarrassing. - Can I just have the shells and cheese? - Lots of calcium, that's good. - Oh, my god, why are those cows so mean to me? Why are they so mean to me? Why do they think I'm pregnant? Oh, my god. - Why don't you just go through another line or go to HR? - I like the hot entree line. Why should I have eat sandwiches just because they're mean? - Simmons, that presentation last week, it really clarified our regional strategies for me. Thanks. - You're welcome. I know those can be a little boring. - Oh, no. - No, I just hope it makes people feel like they're more part of the team. You know, more in the loop. - Amen to that. Oh, how's your hunt going? Are you looking for an h-two or h-three? - Twos and threes are for fags. H-one, baby. I saw one on Craigslist. I think I might check it out this weekend. - Good luck, those thing are safe. You could get hit by a semi, you're ok. - Totally. - Enjoy the rest of your lunch. - I thought you'd have a job interview at lunch today. - No. - You look so nice. - A date. - Date? - Well, not a serious date. It's just, you know, like drinks. I don't know, dinner. Don't you ever date? - Occasionally. - Did you get a credit card from Banana Republic? - No. Well, yeah. I got 15% off. - You look fine, nice. (bell sounds and drum beat) (door button beeps) - Hey, oh wow, you look nice. Do you wanna come up? - Maybe later. - Ok, yeah, later. Should we drive together? You can leave your car here, if you want. - I didn't drive. - You didn't drive? - I don't have a car, I took a bus. - Oh, you took a bus. I thought you had a car, I'll drive then. (door buzzes) Now the seats are Merino leather, ok? And notice the contrasting saddle stitch. Yeah, and I shouldn't have done it but I couldn't say no to the Maple Wood Anthracite. You see that? Yeah? Feel that. Go ahead, feel that. Nice, huh? - It's pretty. - Yeah. Hi, I'll have the lamb and garbanzo couscous. And, is the garlic fresh? - Oh, yeah, each morning, from the chef's herb garden on the roof. - Yes, the couscous. And, we'll start with the-- Yes, we'll have the puffs. And he'll have the pork with salad, vinaigrette. And we'll end with the cheeseboard. - Very well. - Thank you. That sounds good, huh? - Yeah. - So when Pam said she had a friend, I was like, "Ugh". But she was right. How wild is it that we met, you know? - Yeah. - So, where do you work out? - Oh, you know, not much. - Oh. Really? You should. - I walk. - (laughs nervously) I guess that's something, right? - Yeah. - Can I interest you in our desert menus? - No, thank you, not tonight. - I'll leave one, just to-- - No, thanks. Could I get some coffee? (other people talking) That will be 182.53 each. 19 5/8% inclusive. That sound right? - Sure. (car door closes) - Where have you been? - What are you doing here? - The police called me. They couldn't get a hold of your phone. - We were at the doctor and the phone was off. The police? What happened? - There was a fire at the Abbots'. Kay is dead. - I am so sorry. Oh, my god, Kay. I'm so sorry, you can stay here as long as you need. - His son is on his way up from San Jose. (sighs) They said it was electrical. - What's wrong with you? - Nothing. It's just that I got this in the mail today. This is my contribution to society. We say that we are enabling the communications revolution and bull shit, but the VC sucklings upstairs have finally realized you can't run a company on goodwill and fairydust. Now it's just another way to cram ads down people's throats. And, how did my personal address get on this mailing list? - Did you get that in the mail? I never get those things. How random. You'll never catch me at Curves. - I wouldn't, they don't let men in. - A room full of women working out. What am I supposed to look at? So, you gonna see that guy again? - I don't know if he's the one. He talks about himself a lot. But, I mean, I'd see him again, at least once. One nice thing about the self-obsessed, is they have really nice abs. - It's Italy week again. That means salmon pasta is back. Good source of protein. - You can't pretend that you're pregnant just because those two are mean to you. - Maybe I can. - Why don't you just go to HR? They can help you resolve situations like this. - And let those two win? They thrive on hurting people. I wouldn't give them the satisfaction. - You're kind of scaring me. - Mmmm, is that kale? - They're really nice, huh? - Yeah. - It's true what Pam said. - Yeah. - What do you mean, "Yeah?" How do you know what I'm gonna say? - I mean, what's true? - That you shouldn't keep any secrets. I consider myself a pretty open person. - Yeah. - Yeah? - Jesus. - What is it, is there something you need to say? What? - No. - Then what? Are you seeing someone else? - No, no. - Then what? - I don't have any secrets, it's just-- - Just what? God, what? - It's just if I am true and honest, if I really tell you how I feel, I have to say I don't like spending time with you. You only care about yourself. You only think of yourself. - I just told my mom about you, what a great guy you are. - See? All about you. Where did this come from? - Didn't he sign it? - This isn't from you? Is this a joke? - Oh, cool card! - Isn't it? Yesterday it hit me that I have the date, and I feel so unprepared. How is he approaching this? We work just a few floors from each other. That's just an extra layer of what if. And my hair. I loved my hair when I got it cut two weeks ago. Now it seems to be too long in the front. It makes my neck look fat and my head round. - You're right. If this doesn't work out, he works just down the stairs from you. You're gonna have to see him every day. You sure this is a good idea? (dog barking) - Down Cupcake, down. (dog barking) - Hi. - Hi. Cupcake! (dog barking) - Hi, how are you? - Do you wanna come in? - I don't think we have time. - Maybe later? - Yeah, later. (dog barking) I liked the card, thank you. - I've been trying to figure out a way to ask you out for months. I wasn't sure if you were gay. - Yep, I'm gay. - Good. - Where did you find that card? It seemed vintage. - It is, I've had it since I was ten. I keep things. You never know when they're gonna come in handy. - Since you were ten? Where was it since you were ten? - In the card cabinet, under valentines. - Seriously? - Alice in Traffic says I'm a hoarder, but it's collecting. It's all organized. - Well, I'm glad you saved it. - So, Louise, from PR was telling me that her mom had a raccoon in her roof or her attic or something. But that her mom didn't want the man to come out because she was afraid that he was gonna kill the raccoon, but then it died, anyway. And it stunk up her mom's house so bad that she's been staying with Louise for the whole past month. - My bus is in six minutes. I had a, a nice time at dinner. Why did it take us so long? - I don't live that far from here. - Yeah? - It's still early, come on. - Sure, sure, for a few minutes. - There's nothing in the employee handbook, hourly or otherwise, concerning undergarments. - I think I should be heading home. We both have to work tomorrow. - I thought we were getting our flirt on. - We were, we are. Can't we just not have sex on the first date? - Sure we can't, but why not? - I just, if we're gonna start seeing each other, I'd like this to last. We work two floors from each other. We got plenty of time. - So you don't think I'm attractive? - Of course I do. Let's have dinner on Friday. - So we're gonna have sex on Friday? - Why do you need a timeline? - How am I supposed to know if I like you if we don't have sex? Hi. Hi. - Hey, which do you like better? I want something classic but edgy. - Are they different? Did you just switch them? Do it again. - We're trying to attract more women to the chat client. - They both look nice. I'm in Billing. - [Omar] Ivan is on two oh three. - Thanks. - That guy calls you a lot. - Who? - Omar. - He's the receptionist. Hi, Ivan, how are you? Oh, fine, what can I do for you? Yeah, just a sec, Tina! What was the weight on the cover for the annual report? They say the rec form says 80 pound linen warm white, and the spec form says 80 pound linen recycled warm white. - Recycled. - It's the recycled. Yeah, you, too. Right, next month. - [Omar] Jôrge, Tina has a call on two three oh. - Thanks. - See? Why did he have to call you? Why didn't he just ring Tina? She has a phone. - He's married and has two kids. What are you talking about? - Yeah, well, he calls you a lot. (types on keyboard) - Hey, good night. - Night. - Wait a minute. You're seeing Terry tonight, right? - Yeah! - And you're sure he's gay? - Positive. - See ya. - Meredith, from D&R, was taking a self-defense class, one of those scare tactic ones, and guess who was there? - Lynn, from Accounting. - How did you know that? - Is that the class where they had the poster in the cafeteria for the past month? How did you survive in a house like that? You must've had no privacy. - I didn't really. It was ok by the time I got to high school because two of my sisters had moved out of the house. But I didn't have my own bed until I was ten. Just in time. - I had my own double when I was four. - And what kind of bed do you have now? - I have a very nice bed. How's yours? - Maybe you should come and see for yourself. - What are you looking at? I fucking saw you looking at me, faggot. I'll fucking show him who the faggot is. - What's that supposed to mean? - [Terry] Run! Down an alley? Why is that a good idea? We need to find a cop or stay in the light. Those are good ideas! You were looking at him, weren't you? - No, I was looking at the other one. - Are you serious? We could've gotten killed, it happens all the time! We need to find the police! Ok, we need to find the police. - They won't do anything unless we get the crap beaten out of us. - Are you kidding? - Calm down. - I'm not gonna calm down! Those guys just tried to kill us. - It's over, they're gone. Let's go back to your place. - What? No, those guys could've killed you. The way that you were checking that guy out, groping a random stranger with your eyes. - Let's walk it off. - No. I'm gonna get a cab. Alone. - Good morning! I'm sorry about Friday night. Did you get any of my messages? (elevator rings) (elevator opens) (elevator rings) (elevator opens) I'm-- Are you mad? - Am I mad? Mad? You almost got me killed last night and you thought it was funny. Am I mad? - I think you're overreacting a bit. - I think it would be better if we were just colleagues. It was fun, but you're crazy. Carey in Receiving was right. - Who? We had one bad night. - One out of two. - And we got through it. I would like to see where this goes. - I have to work with you, but the American with Disabilities Act doesn't apply to dating. So I'm out. - Ouch. (phone rings) - Hey. - Hey, wanna go see a movie? - Oh, no. I'm working. Maybe tomorrow? - Yeah, maybe. All right, later. - I think it'd be cool to go to couple's counseling from the get-go. The first date was going to see the counselor. - Get all the bad stuff out of the way before you get blinded by all the sex? - Yeah, (laughs softly) yeah. - I think the sex is designed to blind you before you get to all the bad stuff, so that by then you're stuck. How come you never get stuck? - Why don't you? - Why don't you? - Why don't you? - I can't imagine. - Because everyone wants me to be who they think I should be, and I want them to be who I think they should be. We can never just be ourselves. (phone notification rings) - My mom thinks the moon landings were fake. - That explains a lot. All of them? - I told her that's silly, that we left a flag there, she says, "How does tinfoil protect a man from space?" She says she knows about Photoshop. - I guess it would be pretty easy to fake. - I know, right? I hate it when she's not wrong about things like that. - Why is everything a conspiracy theory? - Because people are greedy. They lie to make themselves appear otherwise. - Thanks for getting me out of the house. - [Omar] Ivan, from Freerhoffer, is on his way to see you. (instant message pops up) (instant message pops up) - We don't do that much printing any more. - Don't tell him that. - George, Tina? - That's us. - I'm Ivan. From Freerhoffer. You're probably expecting my dad. You talk to him sometimes. - Maybe that's it. - Are you ready for lunch? - I'll get my jacket. - That was good. - Where's your convention? - At my hotel, around the corner. - I bet a printing convention gets pretty crazy. - These guys talk a big game but they're all in bed by ten. I'm just in town for one more day. - Have you had a chance to see much of the city? - No, it's just been speakers and seminars, and lame convention bars at night. - We should take you out tonight. - Yeah, let's go dancing. Where are the boys? - Oh, ok. - I don't know, I haven't been out dancing in a long time. - Have fun. ("Let's Get" by Skywalker OG) ♫ Let’s, Let’s, Let’s, Get, Get ♫ Let's Get, Let's Get ♫ - What brings you in so early? - Hey, hey. I, yeah. Good morning. I just wanted to, you know, get an early start on some stuff. - Looks like you could use some coffee. - That's exactly what I could use, right now. (baby cooing) - Pam? - Hey, what are you doing here? - I'm just having a late lunch. Guess you can go shopping whenever you want. - I haven't been out of the house in two months. Except for the park or the grocery store. - So is it everything you'd hoped it would be? - You know, it is. - A few more weeks, and then day care, right? - I don't know. - What? - I don't know if it's the best thing for me, or for Pearl. - When did you drink the Kool-Aid? - You wanna hold her? - I have a meeting to get to. But it was really good to see you. - Yeah, you too, I'll see you soon. Maybe we can get lunch sometime. - Yeah. - Hey. - Good afternoon. - Can I help you with those? - Sure. You know, I thought about selling this place but everything else I looked at was just so small. Besides, I really love this place. - You can't tell anything has happened. Are you going to a show? - Oh, no, I don't think I'm gonna go. Would you like the tickets? - What kind of show? - Well, Kay, Mrs. Abbot, and I had been looking forward to that for some time. She got me the tickets for my birthday. She'd want me to go but, no, I don't think I can. - What kind of show? - Chamber music. - Oh. You know, I'm not doing anything that night. - No, really. (laughs softly) You're too kind, thanks. - No, really, what time? I need to broaden my horizons and, besides, a birthday gift should not be wasted, right? - I mean, this isn't like a date or anything. - Of course. - Ok, meet me at the box office at 6:30? - Do you wanna grab dinner first? - I, no, thank you though. (music playing quietly) (email notification rings) - Hey. - Hi, Hor-hay. - Hey, Jôrge. - So good to meet you. We almost have the same name. - We do, we're both George. - You spell it with a J? I thought that little symbol meant hor. - No, it means Jor. - With a J, huh? - Like the saint, take it up with my mom. - You hungry? - I could only get a half-hour today. - Yeah, me too. They have foot-longs, sausages, and standard issue dogs. I think I'm gonna get a hot link with cheese and fries. - Have you done this very much? - What, this meeting online thing? Not much. - What's not much? - Well, never when we had lunch. - This is my first time, I wasn't sure what to expect. I mean, I've chatted, but never met someone, physically. - I don't think you can say we met physically, yet. (laughs) - Yeah. It's a beautiful day. Maybe I could push lunch a few minutes longer. - Yeah, I think I could, too. - That was amazing, thank you. - Oh. - No, really, thank you. - You're welcome. Kay would've really liked you. Have you ever built anything? Done any carpentry? - No. - Do you know what a dovetail joint is? It's a way of cutting two pieces of wood to join them together. That's me and Kay. - That sounds nice. - It was. It was amazing, my dove. (weeps) There's a hole the size of the world in my heart. (weeps) - What do you mean, you were at Cravers? You know you can't eat that stuff, your-- Just because it's on the way doesn't mean you have to stop in. How's Aunt Jean's hip? Oh, how long's that supposed to take? Ok, soon, yes. I love you. - What the hell are you doing? - Do you know what's in this stuff? - Yeah, what are you doing? Where's Pearl? - I just started thinking today, about what we eat. - Babe, what's wrong with what we eat? It's what we've always eaten. - I just can't pronounce most of what's in this stuff. I think I'd like to make an effort for us to eat more fresh real food. - What have you been reading? (baby starts to cry) - Look, I'll get her. Could you clear all this stuff out? And, baby, what's for dinner? (baby cries) - I don't know, I'll get something together. I have been going all day. I just lost track of time! - Do you want some? - Yeah, lots of fruit. (Jôrge giggles) - Mmmm. - What's a color that says, "Welcome to out support page "but don't ask too many questions, "because this is a pain in the ass to moderate?" - Blue. Oxygen depleted field-behind-the-stars, blue. (instant message pops up) - What color are you using? - Green. (mouse click) - Maybe a mild pepper-orange with a drop shadow or depth text. - I can't do this. Not anymore. The system is broken, and we make it look pretty. This whole charade is just a bid to make some assholes rich in an IPO. This is not innovation. This place will be gone in five years, forgotten in six. - We help people communicate. - What else are you gonna do? - I have a library card and $20,000 in the bank. - How much do you get paid? You couldn't possibly have that much. - I probably make less than you. I don't have any debt. - Where are you going? - Hand in my resignation. - Subtle. - Good luck. I'll miss you guys. (bomb explodes, gun fires) - No, fuck, it's not fair! So. How are the Georges? - Good, great. I think he wants me to marry him, though. When we eat out, he's always's like, "What do you think of that china pattern?" And he keeps wanting me to video chat with his mother. - There are worse things than being a kept man. - If only, it's always dutch. - Hmmm. - How long now? - Twelve weeks, or so they say. I honestly don't know how much more of this I can take. - What? - I keep having to pee. - Have you heard from Clem? - No. - Nothing? - No, not a thing. - That's not fair. - She said she didn't sign up for this and she wants something different. - Well, she got that. - I ran over her laptop. On purpose. - What? - She left it on the back seat of my car. It just kind of slipped out. - He's just not what I expected from an online ad. He's sweet, and cute, and smart. And he has the most amazing house. House! - Do you like him? - I don't like dating someone with the same name. No matter how it's spelled. - Why would someone do that? Don't we work with adults here? - (giggles) It's kind of funny. (giggles) - It's defacing company property. - It'll wipe off. - There's this kid in my neighborhood that kept tagging the corner store. Everyone knew it was him, he wasn't very discrete. They didn't give me broccoli. - Maybe it's under your meat. - The pet shop owner caught the kid one day and hit him so hard, the kid was hospitalized. - Good for him. - Kids need somewhere to express themselves. - Scribbling gibberish across bus seats is not self-expression. Hurrah for your pet shop owner. - Hurrah? - Hurrah. - The pet shop owner got six months. - Some friends are coming from back home, and we're gonna go to my cabin. You wanna go? - When? Sure. - About a month and a half. I know they'll love you. I've known them both since college. I think you'll love them, too. - I'm sure I will. - How long has she been down? - About forty minutes. Hello? - Hey, how are you? I got some really good stuff. Stuff I have no idea how to cook. - Then how do you know it'd be good? Why can't we just get stuff from the store? They have what I want. - I am just trying to do some small thing to make the world a better place for Pearl, and us. - Babe, buying vegetables we won't eat just 'cause they're locally grown is not gonna stop the planes from South America. - You don't have to eat any of it. Microwave yourself a couple bags of popcorn and die when you're 50. - [George] She's really cute. - [Glen] She is. So, you met online? - Bear fan website. - Oh, you're from Chicago? - Grass-fed. Raised just down the peninsula. - Now that looks good. - Does anyone need more wine? - Sure. - Sure. - Sure. - George is from Chicago. - Wisconsin. - Oh. - That's near Chicago, right? - Yeah. - Online, so, how does that work? Do you guys need webcams? - You don't need one. - We just chatted, like texting. - But you knew what he looked like. - There's profile pictures. - And everyone has screen names. - We don't need to! - I love your little apartment. - Little? - It's cute, you make the most of it. I do wish you had a bigger TV. We'll have to see what we can do about that. - We really can't do anything about that. This TV is only two years old. - I just mean, if I'm gonna be watching a lot of TV over here, maybe I can get you one. - No, thanks. Thank you, but I like my TV, it's fine. - We can watch TV at my place. - We could move the sofa closer. - Amir, over there, after DOSAT. - What was, what was the lady in the yellow dress all about? Was she real? Was she in the kid's mind? No, the mom saw her. - I don't know, I thought she was real but no one seemed to see her. It was a little weird when the kid started to see the ghosts, but I was like, ok, let's see where this goes. - Then the mom goes blind, and the grandma. - The grandma, I forgot about the grandma. But I could almost accept all of that to some degree but the lady in the yellow dress. - That was just like, what the fuck. (laughs) You ready to get out of here? - Yeah, sure. I've got a bus coming in 16 minutes. - You don't have to take the bus home. - You can't drive me, you're silly. - No, you can just stay at my place. - Oh. Maybe. - Why did you send yourself flowers? - I didn't, what? - It's kind of sad. - I didn't, I did not send myself flowers. - He's got this clingy boyfriend, with the same name. - He spells it differently. - He spells it the right way. - He spells it with a G. - Hoar-hay, you spell it with a J, it's pronounced Hoar-hay. They are nice flowers, though. - Why is he sending you flowers? - He just likes to send flowers. Have a nice day! They are pretty. - Yeah, ok. - [Jôrge] Why can't I just get flowers? Why is that weird? - Just what are you gonna do with flowers? - [Jôrge] What does anyone do with flowers? I'm gonna put them on my table. I'll look at them. They're pretty. - Ok. - Why, don't you like to get flowers? - Of course, I do. - [Jôrge] She just never does. - I-- - Your mother doesn't count. - You should get flowers every day. - This is Becky and Gus. - A week in the woods! - Nothing but quiet and stars. - I'm so excited. I've never been on a vacation like this in, ever. (George laughs) - You guys have enough room? - Yeah, we're fine. - When did you guys get in? - Just this morning. - We've been up since 1:30. - Which is last night for you. Is everyone in? (car starts) (swing music) (woodfire blazing) I need to get to bed. It's been a long day. - Night - Good night. - Good night. - Well, I guess I should turn in, too. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. (chuckles) Good night. - Good night. - Good night. (birds chirping) - Hi. - Good morning. - Is George up? - Not yet. - Oh. You know I’m, I'm not. - You're not what? - Not interested in going to the falls today. - Why on earth not? - Because it's gonna be too wet. - If you're afraid you'll get wet, wear a parka. ("Fillmore Swing" by The Vivants) - Could you please stop implying I'm gay? - What are you talking about? - I see the looks you give me, the knowing looks. - Oh, ok. - Just for the record. - Ok, did I say something? Or did you read my mind? - I'm not. - If you say you're not gay, that's good enough for me. - But you don't believe me. - No, not really. - No one can know. - You're like 40, I won't tell anyone but maybe you need to start dealing with it. And everyone knows. - You don't understand. It's not that easy. I can't be like you, I'm not like you. - That's just sad. - What's sad? - Does G have the water? - You look a little pink. - ♫ Oh, do you remember sweet Betsy from Pike ♫ Who went across the plains with her lover Ike ♫ With two yoke of oxen a big yellow dog ♫ A tall Shanghai rooster and one spotted hog ♫ One evening quite early they camped on the Platte ♫ 'Twas near by the road on a green shady flat ♫ Where Betsy, sore-footed lay down to repose ♫ With wonder I gazed on that Pike County rose ♫ - This has been such a nice day. I don't want it to end. - It has. It's always amazing how big nature is. - I love you. - I love you, too. - I want every day to be as good as today. - It has been a great day. - Would you... Will you marry me? - No. You're serious? Oh, my god. Let me think. - What do you mean no? - We've only know each other for a few months. I thought you were joking. You barely had your pants on. - Two months, two weeks. - What's behind your back? Is that a ring? - Wait, no, I didn't mean no. I meant you took me by surprise, I was kidding. I thought you were kidding! - He said, "No." - I didn't say no. I said you surprised me. I said I thought you were joking. You barely finished putting on your pants. - Why would you say "No" if you thought I was joking? - Yeah, that doesn't make any sense. - I... - I don't wanna talk to you. - I didn't mean "No", I meant-- - I don't want to talk to you. - I should go. - No. Yeah, maybe you should. - What? - Gus can take you. Scratch that, I'll take you. - But we're here all week. Are you sure you don't wanna get me a cab, or rent me a car or something? (George starts the car) ♫ The Shanghai ran off and their cattle all died ♫ That morning the last piece of bacon was fried ♫ Poor Ike was discouraged and Betsy got mad ♫ The dog drooped his tail ♫ and looked wondrously sad ♫ - I'll call you. Or am I just kidding? - What's your problem? I love you. - How do I know you're not kidding? Why do you love me? - Because you're you. - Yeah, well. (George drives off) (new message alerts) - You didn't give me any asparagus. - Oh, right, folic acid. - It's under the meat. - No, it isn't, you didn't put any on my plate. I watched you. - You watched me? - You didn't put any on my plate. Why do you do this? Why are you like this? - What are you talking about? - You don't talk like this to anybody else. What is this, fucking high school? Do I have to call HR? Give me my asparagus! (serving ladies laugh) - That's why you'll never get anywhere in the world, 'cause people don't take you seriously. - What? What don't people take seriously? What people, Glen? - Maybe they're mean to you because you're so confrontational. Couldn't you just ask politely? - I did! - Then, you accused her of lying. - But she, ugh! I'm going over there. They charged me for a side of asparagus. Why did you say no? - I did not say no. I didn't mean to. - But that kitchen. - I know. Maybe I was just in love with the house and the kitchen. He's great. It was too much, too fast. He doesn't trust me. - Are you gonna call him? - He made it pretty clear that he would call me, if calling was gonna happen. - Maybe he's just playing hard to get. - I don't need those kind of games. - So you're back where you started. - I don't need perfection, you know? Just someone who will take me as I am. Maybe celebrate my good parts and help fix the bad? - But it goes both ways, doesn't it? - What? - You have to accept them, too. That's the part that's not fair. (Glen clears his throat) - I got it. - What? - The Senior Marketing Accountancy Manager. The promotion. - Oh, congratulations. - (laughs softly) Thanks. Look, Friday night, our place, about eight. - [Jôrge] Ok. - Did he just invite us to a party? - All right. - Maybe not you. Do you even know him? - He comes in to make prints sometimes. We eat lunch. - He's never invited me to a party before. (people chatting) - Wow, this place is really filling up. - Who are all these people? - Um... I don't know. (laughs) Actually, I don't know any of these people. (Ann laughs) I think they work with Glen. (music quietly playing) (people chatting) - I think I'm gonna head out. - It's early. - Yeah, but I don't talk to these people at work. I don't wanna do it on my free time. - Don't be like that. You should really put in a little more effort. - [Meghan] Hey. - [Pam] Hey. - Would you like some help in the kitchen? - No, thanks, got it all under control. - [Jôrge] I'm gonna head out. It was nice to see you. - You, too. - [Pam] You should take some leftovers. - I'm good. - No, no, let me fix you something. - Those people from the fourth floor are weird. - You sound like something I'm reading. - Yeah? What's that? - Oh, it's just something I picked up. It's about this woman and her life, it's her diary. I'm only up to the eighties and I'm trying to go chronologically Although, I am missing one, 1984, April through October. And I did read the last entry, the day that she died. She had no idea what was coming. - Maybe she's not dead. Maybe she just stopped writing. - Was it like, "Dear Diary, a car is coming at me "with great speed, maybe I should dot dot dot?" - No, it was like, "Dear Diary, "my husband wears too many blue ties, "maybe I should get him some green ones." That was the last entry. Later that day, her toaster shorted out, and she's gone. - Death by a toaster. Is this your neighbor? - Why would you dump someone because of their name? - I didn't dump him at all, he dumped me. - He dumped you because you're afraid of commitment. - Why are you yelling at me about this? He dumped me. - It's not just him. You don't commit to anything. Don't you realize you're pissing your life away? That one day you'll turn around and it'll all be gone, because you let everything and everyone go. - You didn't even know him. You never tried. You never ordered wine with him. - You don't break up with someone because of the way they order wine. Don't you take anything seriously? When's the last time you worked overtime? - Overtime? What does George have to do with overtime? You take this place too seriously. - This is my life, my career. Am I not supposed to take it seriously? - This is my job, not my life. When this place closes off, I'll find something else. - This place is not closing. - I've gotta go. I have to get some email templates to O'Neil by two. Hi George, Jôrge. I understand why you're mad at me, and I'm sorry. I know that I screwed things up. How can I make it up to you? I wish you'd answer my calls. I didn't mean no. You just caught me off guard. (new message alerts) Ok, fine! Call me when you want, you're just being a baby. - That's pretty. - Yeah. Kind of happy morning. Can we eat off these, or are they just to look at? - No, we can eat off 'em. So, and tell me if you don't wanna talk about it. But, why did you say no? - I didn't say no. I thought he was kidding. We'd only known each other for a little while. - Two months, nearly three. - Whatever, he broke up with me. I didn't break up. I just said I didn't wanna marry him, right now. I don't think his friends liked me very much. - Except, the one. - Except for the one. Tony? - [Tony] Hey! - Hey, how are you? - How are you? - Good, good. Tina's good, what are you up to? - Oh, noth... I moved out to the Richmond. - Brr. - Yeah. The price was right, though. I'm working part-time for the Park District. - That's great, that seems to fit you. Are you like doing brochures and forms, or web stuff, or what? - Oh, no, I'm doing in-park stuff now. - Like signs and stuff? That sounds great! - No, like cutting branches and planting flowers and stuff. I had to get out of that maze. - Oh, cool, yeah. It's good to find something you like to do. - Yeah, do, have, am. (laughs) Like it. How's George? - That? Yeah. - Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you two would be married by now. - Yeah, well, I'm not. - It's great to see you, I have to go. I'm late, but it's great to see you. - You're looking great. - Thanks. Tell Tina I said hi. We should grab lunch or something. - Yeah, it was good to see you. We miss you at work. - I'm so late. Are you doing ok? I know that place can get you down. - Yeah, I'm good, thanks. - Still got my number? - Yeah, I do. - Where's your crony? - Oh, Dolores. God rest her soul. (weeps) - Oh, my god. Oh, my god. - Oh, christ, she's gone fishing with her old man. We get vacation days, too, you know? - (clears throat) Can I have the turkey lasagna, with fruit? - [Serving lady] And you? - The chicken fingers with potatoes. (serving lady whistles) Oh, nice. - I'm glad you liked it, dear. - (laughs nervously) This does look good. (phone rings) - Hello? Yeah. Just-- Sure. There is a staff meeting in the conference room. Not you. - Oh. - Now. - Oh. - [Tina] But, what about that email they sent this morning? - I guess we're not part of the exciting new directions. Oh, no. You, too? - Uh, no. - Oh. How long have you known? - For a few days now. I wanted to say something, but I couldn't. - Oh, that's sounds terrible. I'm sorry you had to bear that. - What do you want from me? - Nothing! - There was nothing I could do. - That's fine, can we talk about this later? They only gave us 15 minutes to get our stuff together and get out of this building. - They dropped the boxes off a few minutes after you guys left. What is going on? - They let us go. Us, and anyone else who's been here for more than, what, two years? - Almost everyone, mother fuckers. - What about the new directions? - And the new building. - I guess now we know how they can afford them. Ugh! Don't accidentally take a stapler because they'll probably cavity search us on the way out! (sighs) (seagulls squealing) - You got a little... - Thanks. - No problem.
