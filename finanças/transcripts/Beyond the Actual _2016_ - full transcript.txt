I can do anytime. And what's wrong with Thursdays? I just... I got, you know... stuff I gotta do. That's fine. You're with your son. Well, listen Richard.

I'm glad that I found you though. I really am. - HEY, FUCK YOU! CUNT! What's going on? What do you mean? I'd like to know why we left so early. Or at least where we're going. I have a home up north. Thought I'd show it to you. You got a house? It wasn't much. It's a ways out. A few hours. How much further? - Not far. We're still a few miles out. "You have: one new voice message." "You have: thirteen saved voice messages." "First voice message:" Hey Chris, it's Mason. There's been a family emergency and my girlfriend and I have to go out of town for a couple of days. So, if you're free Monday, maybe you could help us out and look after our daughter for a little bit. Just until my sister is off work. I know it's really short notice, being the weekend... But, we don't really know what else to do. So, give me a call as soon as you can and we can talk about it. Okay. Well, talk to you soon. Bye.
