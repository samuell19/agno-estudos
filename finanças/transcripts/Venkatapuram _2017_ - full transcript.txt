VENKATAPURAM The field will be lush green as long as there are crops in them. But the same field looks like a barren land after the harvest. It is the same with the village as well. The harvest here is the cyclone. And the village which turned into a barren land is Bheemli. What, dude? We have to do something. This ain't giving any kick. Hey! Look over there. The case is arriving. Awsome figure, dude! Come on! Let's go, guys! Hey, what the hell are you doing? [overlap of voices] Hey! Bash them! Just come... Punch him... Punch him... Come on, punch him. There won't be any humanity at the places where there are no humans. Bheemli, which is being ruled by the demons will never become a habitat for humans. This has become a haven for atrocities and crimes. This activity continues until the light spreads by implaing darkness. Oh man! He is here! Hey Anand! What happened to him that he is going away like that? Who do you want? Mastan Bhai has sent us. Okay, come in. [metallic clatter] Uhuh. This one? This one? This one? This one? Uhuh. What about this? Yes. What is the price? 2000 rupees. Wait. Remember one thing very well. It is up to you whether you'd chop animals or humans with this. But if you are caught by the police with this, don't tell my name. Leave. [alarm rings] [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter] [bellows] [phone rings] VENKATAPURAM POLICE STATION-VIZAG -Sir, is this Venkatapuram police station? -Yes, this is Venkatapuram police station. Who is on the line? Sir, my name is Murthy. Another murder took place at Bheemli beach. Is it? Yes, sir. Alright, we are coming. Hang up. Move aside... Move aside... Move aside... [indistinct chatter] George, what happened to him that he is coming here running? -Buddy... -What happened? -Don't you still know the matter? -Which matter? About the murder that took place at Bheemli. A murder that took place at Bheemli? -Come, let's go and check. -Let's go. -Who might have committed this murder? -How would I know? Whoever did this, they've done a nasty thing. Well... If they are holding a grudge on someone, they should be either dumped in the ocean or buried in the soil after killing them. But who the hell is he, that he had killed and dumped in a sack? The police will nab him within one hour after identifying the dead body. The police are arriving. Hey... If the SI sees us here, he might think that we have committed this murder. Hey, let's go. [phone ringing] Good morning, sir. Very good morning, Durga Prasad. Where are you? Sir, I got a call regarding another murder taking place at Bheemli beach. So I went there. Well... Last night, I've sent you a photo of a girl and asked to search for her. Sir, we couldn't find her. We have searched the entire city, sir. Okay. Finish your work quickly and be on the task that I gave you. That's very important. Okay, sir. Thank you, sir. Out of the way... Out of the way... Open it. -Okay, sir. -Out of the way... Sir, this seems like a woman's dead body. Sir, seems like the girl we are searching and this girl are the same. Hey, out of the way... Move aside. Listen... Out of the way... [phone ringing] Hello. Sir, I am Venkatapuram's SI, Durga Prasad speaking. Yes, tell me. The commissioner has filed a complaint in your station about your missing daughter last night. Yes, sir. Did you get any information about your daughter? Not yet, sir. Since yesterday, we've been searching her without having food or sleeping. Listen to me carefully. We found a woman's dead body at Bheemli beach. It is not in a state of identifying. Looking at that dead body, I somehow suspect that she is your daughter. Is it? I'll come right away. We are sending the dead body to autopsy now. -Which hospital? -Rajive Gandhi general hospital. Okay, sir. -Sir... Sir... Sir... -Hey, send everyone away. We found this college bag a little distance away from the murder spot, sir. Look what's inside. -Leave... All of you, leave. -Ornaments, -Just leave. -Books... Sir, there is an ID card as well. Oh my God! The girl who commissioner asked us to search last night and the girl in the identity card is the same. Keep this. Okay, sir. No matter who sees this dead body, the body is in an unrecognizable state. Another thing, sir. The murderers who killed this girl has left another clue. What is it? Nurse This sickle. While taking the dead body out of the sack, we found this in it. This might be of good use to nab the murderer. [sighs] Thank you, doctor. We found a college bag at the murder spot. In that bag, we found a student identity card along with the books. But the main point is that, the who commissioner asked us to search and the girl in the identity card is the same. Hey, give that. This bag belongs to my daughter indeed. The dead body is in the mortuary. Take it without making any delay. Sir, we found in our enquiry that the deceased girl has two friends. Where are they? They are in the college, sir. -Okay, sir. -Sorry, sir. Dear Chaitra... [weeps] Oh, dear! Sir, she is my classmate. She became very close to us in a very short time, sir. Hmm... Well, when, where and how you have met the girl for the last time? We met her when we came to collect the hall ticket at the college. She came on some guy's bike, instead of her moped on that day. When we asked who he was, she said he was her boyfriend. Did she tell where he lives? Yes, sir. She said he lives in the penthouse in her very apartment. Hmm? [in unison] Hmm. Hmm. His name is Anand, sir. He's been living alone in this penthouse for three years. I thought he is a good guy as he's been paying the rent promptly. But I never expected even in my dream that he'd commit murder. I am still unable to believe that he has committed a murder. Do you know where he works? Yes, sir. Where? He works as a pizza delivery boy at Bhavani Nagar Crossroads. He's been working here along with us as pizza delivery boy, sir. I don't know the problem. And he's been not coming to work from two days as well. When I last saw him at Ambedkar colony, I stopped my bike and tried to ask about his problem, sir. But after hearing my voice, he has gone away as if he didn't see me. I didn't understand why he has gone like that. Look, if he ever comes across you anywhere or calls you, inform me immediately. Hmm. Head constable, search the entire auto-rickshaw stand, bus-stand and railway station. Do complete enquiry. If you suspect anyone, detain them first. Okay? [people weeping] The SI has arrived. I did complete enquiry, sir. The one who killed your daughter is none other than Anand, the pizza delivery boy who lives in the penthouse of this very apartment. I'll leave now, sir. Sir, where shall I place this sickle? Do something. -Put it in the storeroom. -Okay, sir. Three cases have come in the morning, sir. Hmm. In two cases, both the parties have compromised and left. And the remaining one is the third case, sir. The guy pertaining to that third case is here. What is his name? His name is Venkat Naidu, a lorry driver. What's the case? Nothing, sir. We caught him while he was trying to cross the border with the fodder load. -Didn't he have a permit? -He did had a permit, sir. Then? We caught him at the border while loading cannabis along with the fodder, sir. [sighs] That's fine about him. What about the guy beside him? Oh, this guy, sir? He's been in the same position since the time he has arrived. No reaction. Hey, didn't yesterday's intoxication wear off? I am talking to you. Speak up. Why aren't you talking anything while I am asking you? [clatters and shatters] Won't you speak up? Huh? Speak up. Hey... If I don't know about who your details, I'll shoot you right here. [phone ringing] [scoffs] Hello, sir. What's the progress of the missing girl's case? I have enquired about it, sir. -Her boyfriend murdered her.-Is it? Yes, sir. Seems like a love affair case. We searched for him but we couldn't find him. But I ensure you sir, that he'd be crushed if I catch him. Be on this case very seriously. -Don't spare him at all. -Okay, sir. [sighs] Is it better to talk to him? Let me try. No... No... He just had got bashed. Hey, both of you eat this Upma and be ready. What should you mean by eating upma? Would you serve us cheap Upma even if we did a mistake? I won't eat. Give it to him. Shut up and eat what is given. Else, I'll get you the other kind of breakfast through our SI. Don't do that, sir. Don't do that. We have seen his aggressive form a while ago. Give it to me. Just eat. Idiot! Hello. Thank God! Task finished! Bro, have Upma. Aren't you hungry? Well, why was the SI so angry at you? Did you commit a murder? Or did your girlfriend cheat and dump you? Say something, bro. We'll know what's inside you only if you speak. Is he a mute by any chance? Are you dumb? Are you really a mute person? Got a cigarette? Oh! That one! Oh! Who are you? Where do you live? Why are the police having so much grudge on you? Consider me as your friend. I am Anand. I lived in the penthouse of Sai Krupa Apartment at Vivekananda colony, Vizag for rent. [music mutes voice] "Cock-a-doodle-do... A new day has begin.

I'll stay here only if there is a possibility to study on the terrace. Else, I'll stay in the hostel until I finish my exams. Alright. Check the terrace upon reaching our flat. If you like it be here, else find a hostel. -What do you say? -Then, it is okay. How is the terrace, dear? I didn't just like it, but it very beautiful as well. "Come and have a smoke" "Come and have to relieve yourself" "Come and have a smoke" Dear Chaitra, enough of your studying. Come and have dinner. -It is getting late. -Okay, mom. I am coming. [indistinct chatter] Excuse me, madam. Yes, come in. She is a new joinee, madam. Go and sit there. Hi, I am Chaitra. I am Rithika and she is my best friend Rekha. Oh, nice! -Hi Rekha. -Hi. -Would you come with me to the restroom? -Yeah. -Excuse me. -Hmm. Can I also join you guys? -Okay. -Okay. Come, let's go. [indistinct lecture] Where did they go? [bell ringing] Let's go. [alarm buzzing] [snoring] [gasps] Yuck! You! Urgh! Yuck! [studying] [studying] Let me not leave him simple. I'll teach him a lesson. [gasps] Oh no! [alarm buzzing] Mom... Why are you shouting? I'm right here. Tell me what is it? -Give me coffee immediately. -Why do you need so early? I saw an idiot in the morning! I'm getting a headache, mom! I lost my mood to study. -Give me the coffee. -Okay, go and get the milk packet. [sighs] Give me an heritage milk packet. Dad. What is it, dear? -I want to go back to the hostel. -Why is it so? A bachelor is staying in the penthouse. I've been going to the terrace every morning to study, but he's been sleeping there drunk. -Is it? -Yeah. I don't feel like studying after seeing him like that. Moreover, I've been forgetting whatever I was studying. -Is it? -Yeah. Dad, I'm not concerned about what you are going to do. Talk to the landlord and make him vacate the flat. Else, I would go back to the hostel. Okay, dear. Leave it to me. Dad, you will do what I asked you, won't you? Leave that to me, dear. I'll take care of it. You don't worry. You're getting late. Go. Hmm. -Bye, dad. -Bye, dear. [indistinct people chattering] By the way, where did you two go yesterday? We didn't go anywhere. Then? We went to the library as we were bored in the class. Is it? Tell me when you go to the library next time. I'll also join you. [In unison] Okay. Okay. Rithika. Urgh! She has been annoying me ever since she came. What is it? Are you going to the restroom? -Yeah. -I'll also join you. Let's go. -We should be careful with her. -Yeah. Else both of us will be in trouble. Rekha. Rekha. -Oh! I'm sorry... -It's okay. [music mutes voice] -[shouts] -[gasps] She's scared...! -Hey! Look at there. -Hey! -There's an awesome figure over there. -Yeah. -Let's go and see. -Come. Let's go, dude. Hey baby! Are you alone? [sniggering] Hey! Come. [indistinct voice] Stop. Hello, stop! Please, stop. -Please, stop... -He won't...! Nobody will stop. Please, help me... -Get on the bike. -Thank you. -Hey! She's going. -[indistinct voice] She left! Actually... thank you very much... It's okay. I am Chaitra. Anand. [music playing] What is this like a kid, dear? Do you know how worried we were? Sorry, dad. I waited for a long time at the college for you. When I thought you'd be late and started walking towards home... I lost my way and ended up going somewhere. I sat at the bus stop in fear as it was dark. -[shouts] -Are you alone? Huh? -[sniggering] -Get on the bike. Who is that guy, dear? Do you know him? Yes, dad. I'll introduce him to you now. -Uncle. -Hmm. What is it, dear? Why is the penthouse vacant? Yes, dear. Why? A guy used to stay in it, right? That guy vacated, dear. Why, uncle? As your studies are getting affected as he's been staying here, your dad came to me yesterday in the evening... Hey Landlord! You can count your money later. I've heard that a bachelor is staying in the penthouse. Yes, sir. What happened? Make him vacate the house before anything happens. What happened, sir? My daughter has been going to terrace every morning to study, but he's been sleeping there drunk. My daughter is having her final exams now. I'm not concerned of what you are going to do. I'll pay the penthouse's rent if necessary. If he doesn't vacate by the time my daughter goes upstairs, to study tomorrow in the morning, we will have to vacate the house. -But sir... -Mind it! Don't say anything! Since your dad asked so seriously I couldn't deny it and on the same night... I'm facing trouble with the tenants staying downstairs because of you. Here is the rent you gave me this month. Take it back and kindly vacate the room. Take it, dear. He didn't oppose me and vacated immediately. Shucks! This is all because of me. Uncle, do you know where he is now? I heard that he is working in a pizza shop at Bhavani Nagar chowrasta. Bhavani nagar... Pizza shop... Okay, thank you, uncle. I slept at my friend's place when I vacated the room that night. I woke up in the morning and left to work. She saw me there and brought me home. She introduced me to her parents. Her father appreciated me for saving her daughter on that night. They asked me to stay in that penthouse. Later her dad... Thank you for saving my daughter on time. It's okay, uncle. If you don't mind, could you please do me a favour? Tell me, uncle. Since we are new to the city, we aren't aware of the routes. My heart has been pounding thinking of last night. In order to prevent such situations, my daughter should become aware of the routes. Is that it, uncle? Don't worry, uncle. I'll show the entire city to your daughter. "Oh, it's magic... Oh, it's magic..." "It's magic everywhere..." "Oh man! Everything that is happening is so bizarre. Did you notice?" "Did you notice the sky coming towards the wave?" "Despite not having much acquaintance" "Despite not being related to each other" "Without actually talking anything" "Without the doubt getting cleared" "I'm getting close to you now" "Oh my goodness! What is this magic?" "No matter how much I think, I don't understand" "Oh my goodness! What is this magic?" "No matter how much I think, I don't understand" "As the time is passing, our bond is getting stronger" "As the initiatives are growing, mute smiles are becoming conversations" "As we keep walking together, tiredness is getting reduced by half" "As our eye gestures are getting converged, the eyes are getting bright" "Our hands are holding each other's" "despite it was not our habit" "The thoughts have become pearls" "and have been rolling on our lips" "Oh man! Everything that is happening is so bizarre. Did you notice?" "Did you notice the sky coming towards the wave?" "Despite not having much acquaintance" "Despite not being related to each other" "Without actually talking anything... Without the doubt getting cleared" "I'm getting close to you now" "Oh my goodness! What is this magic?" "No matter how much I think, I don't understand" "Oh my goodness! What is this magic?" "No matter how much I think, I don't understand" Why aren't you coming to work from the past few days? What's the matter? Who's that girl? A girl? Whom do you mean? Don't bluff with me. RK beach, Jagadamba center, Tenneti park... Do you think that I haven't seen you guys roaming around the city on a bike? -Oh, do you mean that girl? -Yeah. Did you understand it now? -Who is she? -She is just a friend. [bell ringing] Shall we go to the restroom? [indistinct people chattering] Hello Rithika and Rekha. -Chaitra, is it you? -What are you doing here? Oh, this one? We just came upstairs to smoke. -That's all. -Yeah. Is this what you've been doing upstairs every day, on the pretext of going to the restroom? Don't you feel that you've been doing wrong? It's wrong if we smoke in a public place but... who told you that it's a mistake if we smoke in a private place? -Isn't it? -Yeah. Anyway, it's wrong to smoke in the college being girls. Guys smoking is acceptable but not girls? Isn't it wrong? Uh-huh! Chaitra, what are you thinking? Okay, we are going to the restroom. Would you like to join us? I won't come. Okay, she doesn't want to come. -Let's go. -Okay. [music mutes voice] It's okay, try it. I came here in the morning to clean the tank. It was scared to see these. Clean this mess first. Lock the door to prevent students from getting in. Damn! They locked our only spot. Where shall we go to if we want to smoke immediately? Tsk! Yeah, Rithika. Where shall we go? I knew a place which is on the way to our home from college. According to me, there'd be no one there. We can go there and smoke. What do you say? Awesome! Wow! What an awesome place it is! Is it nice? Won't there be anyone here? -People used to be here in the past. -Hello! Don't shout. Anyone would hear us. [phone ringing] Bro, give us two strong beers. -Hello. -Where are you? Hey! We are at the wine shop. What's the matter? Three hot college going girls came to our spot. Hey! Keep an eye on them We are starting immediately. -Hey! Hold this. -What is it? What happened? -Wow! This place is very nice. -Is it? Did you like it? Shiva called me. -Three girls came to our spot it seems. -Is it? Then go fast. Fast! Hey! Careful! Hey Shiva! -Where are they? -Where are the girls? There they are. They were here. Where are the girls? Dude, they were right here. -But they aren't here. -Even I don't understand where they went! What the hell were you doing? -That is... -Shut up! You ruined my mood! Hey! Give me that beer. Take it. Mom, where are you going so early? Uncle has called me to come to the town immediately. Why? He has said that he found a good wedding match for you. Why do you want to get me married so early? The exams aren't comepleted yet. Your exams will be completed in another ten days. Later we should anyway search for a good alliance and get you married, right? Good alliances don't come when we search for it. Which is why, we are in hurry. When would you return? We will return in two days. All the rations that you need are in the house. Don't roam outside but sit and study at home, okay? Okay, mom. I'm bored of studying. Tsk! [dialing] Hi, Rekha. Where are you? What's the matter? I'm all alone at home. I'm really getting very bored. Shall we go out? Did you see the weather outside? It's cool. Do you know how it would be if we go out on the bike with the boyfriend? How would it be? Go out and you'd know. Hello... With a boyfriend? Anand? -Hi -Hi. [aeroplane whoosing] Thank you. Can I ask you something? Yeah, sure. You shouldn't reject it later, okay? Okay. How are you related to me? Friend. -What do you mean? -I'm just a friend. -Is it just that? -Yeah. But would you be as my boyfriend for today? What do you mean? I mean... the one who takes his girlfriend out on the bike to handout. And the one who spends time with his girlfriend when he feels bored. And anything like that... Ah... Anand, please... I request you. Don't tell me that it's not possible. Because I'm bored of studying the repeated subject. I'm scared that I'd forget in the exam, if I read too much. Let's go out for some relaxation. Please, Anand... I request you. Please... Okay. Great, thank you so much. "Who is that appearing in front of me like a dream" "and casting an unknown magic?"

Then why are you wandering with the same girl on your bike yesterday? Then what do you call it as? What is it? I am asking the same. Even I am asking the same to you. It's called falling in love without each other's knowledge. Is it? Now, who has fallen in love and who didn't? I don't know whether you'd fallen in love or not but... ...that girl has definitely fallen in love with you. Wait and watch, you'll also fall in love with her. Thank you. Hey! Did you like the girl? Is she beautiful? Okay. If you are okay with this match, let's fix the wedding dates once your daughter finishes her exams. What do you say? Okay. If you say okay, I'm also okay with this. Then we shall leave now. Okay. "It's flying..." "It's flying..." Hello. Anand, I'm Chaitra speaking. How come you called me suddenly that too over a phone? I called you to discuss some personal matter. Okay, tell me, what is it? -Not on the call...-Ah... I'm waiting for you at RK beach. I'm coming right away, bye. Personal matter? "It's flying..." Yes! "It's flying..." [people chattering] Anand. Chaitra, what happened to you? Why are you crying? My parents are planning to get me married. Oh! But I don't want to get into this marriage. Have you been in love with someone? There's nothing as such. No? Then why do you say that you don't want to get into this marriage? Actually... I made a mistake. Mistake? What is it, Chaitra? [studying] [studying] [studying] [phone ringing] Hi, Rithika. What are you doing at home? I'm studying. Studying? Won't you come to college and get the hall ticket? Oh, no! I forgot. Mom, I'm going to college to get my hall ticket. Tsk! Huh! Anand. Okay, Anand. Thank you so much. Bye. -Bye. -Hey! Who is he? He's my boyfriend. Boyfriend? You never mentioned him before? Where does he stay? He stays in the penthouse in our apartment. Hey! Your boyfriend is handsome. -What's your name? -I'm Rekha. I'm Rithika. I'm Chaitra. I think this is the last time we are smoking together. Yeah, maybe. Let's sit here. So, I have a surprise for you both. A surprise? What is it? Guess it. I will guess it. Your marriage alliance is fixed, right? No. You got placed in Infosys. Not even that. What is that surprise if it's not about the job or the wedding? Wait, I'll show you. Ta-da! Hey! Passport. So, you are going to the US to pursue your PG? -Congrats. -Wow! -Congrats. -Thank you so much. But I'm sad about something. In which matter? My family doesn't know that I got a visa. How will you manage? They won't let me go if they know about it. -Oh! -What if your family fixes your marriage unaware of this visa matter? I'll show my visa and tell them that I am not for marriage yet. What would you if they don't accept even after that? What do you do if your wedding doesn't get fixed with the guy who you love? I'll call him and say, "Will you take me away or shall I sneak out on my own?" Me too. I'll write a letter and board a flight overnight, without informing them. So... Rekha, look there Look... Girls... Catch them. Nicely found them! -Hey... Hey... -Hey... Get off... [groans] Hey, stop. [screams] Let go of me. [groans] Stop... Where will you run? Damn! Come, we are waiting for you. Who are they, mom? Get ready first. [music mutes voice] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Hello Rithika, nothing bad happened to you, right? Nothing happened, we are alright. Thank God! I felt very tensed about what might have happened to you. Where are you? We are at RK beach. If you come here in 10 minutes, we'll tell you an important matter and leave. Okay. I'll be there. Rithika, are you sure that nothing happened to you? Chaitra, don't talk anything now. Take this phone number first. Whose phone is this? First take it. Why are you giving it to me? Listen. After you have run away from that place, we too tried our best to escape. Hey, stop! -Hey, stop! -[groans] Because of that, they didn't spare us. They have caught us. Let go of me. Despite pleading them after giving everything we have... Take it off... Come on. But what they did to us... Hey, change quickly and bugger off! They have shot the video of their act. If you don't go to them now, they are threatening that they would post that video on the internet. -Hey... -Hey... -Stop... -Stop... It's just two of you, right? What's with the third bag? -That belongs to my friend. -Friend's bag? Tell that girl who ran away to come to us and collect her bag if she wants it. Else, I'll dump her in the ocean. Got it? They wrote that number and gave it to us telling that you have to call them before you go. Look Chaitra, this is no time for you to weep. If you want your bag, call to that number and get your bag from them without letting anybody know about it. But don't you go to the police station at any cost for that bag. If you go to the police station, we'd get into a situation where we have to commit suicide. We called you to come here to inform this. We'll leave now. Come, let's go. Hey... Don't let go. Hold her, Shiva. Shut up! Keep driving... Keep driving... I already know that she wouldn't come despite giving the phone number. Nicely found her! Hey! I might have let go of her friends, but I won't spare her. See, what I am going to do with her. Keep driving... Keep driving... -Hey... -Whoa! [screams] [thud] I couldn't think of ways to get my bag from them. I remembered you suddenly and called you, Anand... Thinking that you'd help me. Come with me. Anand... Where are you taking me? [phone ringing] Chaitra, their phone is ringing. Talk to them. What should I talk to them? Tell them you are going to go to them tomorrow to get your bag. No... No... I am scared. What can I talk? I am with you. Just talk. Hello... Hello... -Just talk...-Hello. Give it to me. -Hello. -Hello. Hello... I called regarding my bag. You? You have escaped from us, right? Since you have called us, it means that you are really scared. -Huh? -Yes, sir. Hey... Put aside these formal ways of talking. Tell the time when you'd come here. Will you come or not? I'll be there tomorrow exactly at this time. The time is 5.30 pm now. You have to be here tomorrow ten minutes before this same timing. If you don't up, the attack on you that took place today will happen every day. Got it? Hel... Hello. What happened? He asks me to there tomorrow by 5.30. He was threatening that he won't spare me no matter where I would be if I don't show up. Your problem will be solved by 6.30. Enough? But how are you going to do all that? Leave all that to me. I know very well what to do with them in order to not meddle with you again. Okay? Let's go. [alarm rings] Hey... What happened after that? I'll narrate the rest of the story. Come with me. My SI is calling you. Sir, please give me two minutes. The story was interesting. Hey, will you get up or shall I hit you with a baton? -Just get up... Hey... -Sir... Sir... Story, interest, my foot! -Come, rascal... Come... -Sir... [screams in pain] Ow! Ouch! Please don't hit me, sir. [screams in pain] -Sir, he is Venkat Naidu. -I know. Sir supplies marujuana in a fodder lorry. Rascal, even after getting caught supplying marijuana in a fodder lorry, you dare to do name-calling when the constable served you upma citing. Would you be served with a 5-star hotel food instead of Upma for your work? -You! -Sir... Bend... Just bend... -Just bend... -Ow! Please don't hit me, sir. -Upma... You call it cheap upma! -Ow! Please don't hit me, sir. I'll die. How dare you do name-calling! -Cheap upma! Cheap upma! -Please don't hit me, sir. Oh no! Bloody criminal! -Hey -Sir. -Take this rascal to the court. -Okay, sir. -Get up. -Ow! Move... Just move. -Sir... -Yes. What shall we do with the youngster who got caught at Bheemli? -Did he open up or not? -He didn't utter a word till now, sir. Bend him and bash until he opens up. Sir, he is going to die at the station if we keep bashing him. Sir, somehow put him in the prison and shut his case. Do something. Open a criminal file in the chargesheet and put him in the prison stating attempt to murder. Okay, sir. [typewriter clacking] After analysing the precedents, the court sentences the accused with ordinary imprisonment for 9 months, under the attempt to murder act for trying to kill the cops. That girl is not here now, sir. We have discharged her back 5 months ago after knowing that she was not having any mental problem. She is currently working as a teacher in a government school. The name of the school is... Netaji government school. Oh! Thank you very much, madam. [music mutes voice] "Who is she?" "Who am I?" "What's..." "between us?" "Why is it..." "unlike the past days?" "What happened..." "to the present?" "My heart has been drowned with clouds of rain" "Before I understood what's happening, it deeply impacted me" "All my past flew in the air today, at once" "Something chided me when I have been dwelling upon it" "Is my mere life..." "able to bear this?" "Doesn't she know..." Teacher -"about this pain?" -Yes. Someone came to visit you. Visit me? He said he is Anand when I asked his name. [indistinct chatter] Chaitra... -Chaitra... -Huh! Look Chaitra, we can't live thinking of an untoward incident that happened in our lives. Please... Please get rid of that memory first. Please... That's not a petty incident to get rid of it, Anand. I know. But you can't dwell upon it, as long you live, Chaitra. It is better to die than live like that, Chaitra. Let's go. You've got no one in your life and it is the same with me as well. Let's die together. That's the only solution to our problem. Shall we die? Say something, Chaitra. Please... What shall I speak, Anand? What do I talk about? Shall I talk about 6 months of my hospital life? Shall I talk about 9 months of my loner life? Shall I talk about my parents who died because of me? Tell me, Anand. Come on, tell me. Answers always keep looking at those who ask questions, Chaitra. A solutionless problem or answerless question don't exist on this earth. You are my destination. I'll become the solution to your every problem. From now, your sorrow belongs to me, your anger belongs to me. Your vengeance too belongs to me. [thunder rumbles] Hey Muthaylu, it is time to go to rounds. Take out the vehicle. [singing] What's the matter? Sir, I have to file a complaint. Lost your bike? No, I lost my sickle. What? You lost your sickle? When and where did you lose it? Sir, I lost it 9 months ago. You woke up now and came here for your sickle that was lost 9 months ago... "Sir, I need to file a complaint. I lost my sickle." Hey, does police station seem funny to you? No, sir. I really lost my sickle. Okay. Here are pen and paper. Write down when and where it was lost and who you are suspecting? Write down everything. "I lost my sickle, sir." Sir... Hey... You wrote so soon. What? The sickle is in this station? The complaint is to be filed against the police station? Hey, which sickle were you talking about? I was talking about the sickle that was found nine months ago at Bheemli beach, in the sack that contained the dead body of a woman. Hey, who are you? Have you still not recognised me? Look at me properly. You are... You are... [groans in pain] Hey... [shatters] Hey... Hey... Hey... [groans] [gunshot] [gunshot] Hey... [bellows] Hey... Hey... [slits] [door creaks open] [humming] -Sir... -Hmm... The house is very beautiful. Well, did you buy or occupy it? I have occupied it. -Is it? -Do what you have come for. -Where is the washroom? -Over there. What is he doing here? What work have you got here? [groans] [groans] [groans] [bottle shatters] [groans] [glass shatters] [screams] Hey... Just a minute... Hold on! Hold on... Tell me why you are killing me. You ask why I am killing you. Did you already forget what you and your men did at Venkatapuram police station 9 months ago? Huh? [groaning] Sir... Sir... Sir... Sir... Ah! Hey... [gunshots] The attack that happened on Venkatapuram police station created havoc in the city. A constable who was on duty was killed very brutally in the attack. Apart from that... Venkatapuram SI Durga Prasad was attacked on the same night in his own flat. SI Durga Prasad along with his driver and head constable were killed in the attack. The Commissioner of Police says it's the same culprit behind both attacks. A Red-alert has been announced throughout the city. A special team is in search of the culprit to trace him out and discover his motive. Sir! We don't know who he is. No one is able to crack why he has targeted and killed only the cops. Deal with this case and the investigation procedure is completely upto you. But I want this case file to be closed as soon as possible however you do it. No doubt, sir. You can leave this case to me now. Whoever he is and wherever he is hiding... tracing him out is my duty. All the best. Sir. Drive us to Venkatapuram Police Station quickly. [cop siren wailing] VENKATAPURAM POLICE STATION - VIZAG Venkatapuram Police Station. [shot fired] He has walked right into a police station and bashed and killed policemen. He is an audacious person. Looks like he hasn't tasted the bashing of a cop. What do you say, sir? Same as you said, looks like he hasn't tasted the bashing of a cop. A constable has survived alive in this case as per the record. Check which hospital is he admitted to. It's the King George hospital, sir. Then drive us there. OK, sir. [indistinct chatter] Good morning, sir. [Ajay sighs heavily] My name is Ajay Varma. I'm investigating the Venkatapuram Police Station case. -Sir. -What is your name? -Deepak, sir. -Are you married? No sir. Since when are you working as a constable at Venkatapuram Police Station? It has been four years, sir. Okay, besides all these... How did all of this happen? Who is that man? Why did he target you in specific? That's what I still don't understand, sir. Rack your brains and tell me. Err... how much ever I try to remember, I don't recognize him, sir. If I did, I would have revealed his identity first. 28th, the Thursday, the day of murder. Right from SI Durga Prasad starting from his house till he reached back home, give me every detail without missing anything. I'll tell you, sir. Like every other day, we took the vehicle from the station, and headed to SI sir's house to pick him up. There were almost no cases from morning till 1pm in the noon. Sir, your lunch is ready. Even from noon till 6pm there were no significant cases that needed SI's attention, sir. Hey there... start the vehicle, we have to go on area rounds. A few minutes after the SI started from the Police Station, the Head Constable called SI sir from the Police station. But he hung up without speaking a word. The SI was enraged by that. Hey! Why do you call me and fall silent? [groans] Hello! -Ah! -Oh! -Turn back and head to the station. -OK, sir. I'll teach them a lesson. So while we were on our way to the Police Station... suddenly the Commissioner called SI sir. and we had to go to the Minister's house instead of the Police Station We've been waiting since half an hour like dogs. Wonder what they think about the cops. [groaning in irritation] Makes me feel we are watchdogs. Hey... hey... Yeah, sir... Did you see him? Isn't he the same guy? Who is he, sir? Well, the same guy man! Nine months ago, we arrested a guy carrying a sickle to kill someone. -Do you recall that? -Yes sir! I do. -Is it him? -It's definitely him! He gaze had a message for me. Err... what kind of a gaze, sir? Well, it was angry, like warning me... His gaze felt like he meant doom to me. [stammers] Why do you think he did that? Well sir, we bashed him badly that day. Looks like he didn't forget that yet. Huh? Yeah. [sighly deeply] [siren wailing] One should live the life of our SI, dude. A different girl everyday. We don't know what happened upstairs, sir. But we were shocked to see the girl who accompanied our SI upstairs... ...running towards us in fear. [lady sobbing] -What is it? -Someone is killing your SI upstairs. -Our SI? -Save him. -Let's go! -Come! After the girl told us that, we ran in the SI's flat, sir. But by the time we went there, the SI was already dead, sir. We were shocked at that sight. Meanwhile, someone shot at us from behind, sir. [shots fired] We collapsed right there. I woke up after two days and realized I was still alive, sir. -What is it sir? -Huh? Lost in some thought? Usually, people fear a policeman or run away seeing one. But someone has dared enter a police station and killed every cop there... I don't understand what atrocity he has faced. If we have to find out the reason, he should tell us himself. How is it possible, sir? We don't know his name. Don't know his whereabouts. Don't know how he looks either. Atleast we don't even have his fingerprints. He'll come himself. [laughs] How is it possible, sir? In the attack on Venkatapuram Police Station on the 18th night, a constable was fatally wounded... and has been treated in King George Hospital and is out of danger now. ACP Ajay Varma who has been investigating this case... said that with the help of the constable, the culprits would be nabbed soon... and would be taken into custody. Huh! [Nurse groans in shock] [groans] [panting] [sickle clatters] [panting heavily] I don't want to trouble you with too many questions. I'll ask you just one question and you better answer that right. Why did you kill the Venkatapuram cops? My name is Anand, sir. I used to work as a pizza delivery boy in Bhavani Nagar. [no voice] [alarm ringing] I went to Bheemili with a sickle in hand to get back her bag even by killing them. What happened after you went to Bheemili with that sickle? I'm asking you... What happened after you went to Bheemili with that sickle? I went to Bheemili with the sickle in hand to bring back her bag, ...her exam hall ticket and other belongings even by killing those guys. I waited for them in a raging fury to kill them any moment. Suddenly, I heard them coming closer. Assuming they are close, I closed my eyes and made a strike. [roars] And then? Assuming that I had beheaded atleast one of them with my strike, I opened my eyes. That's it. Suddenly fear gripped me. I was so scared that I wanted to escape from there immediately. But you went there to kill them. Why were you scared then? It wasn't those guys who came then. Not them? Who was it then? [roars] [SI groans in shock] Nab him and drag him to the station! Drag him now! [Anand groaning in pain] [panting] [groaning] Hey you! If we weren't attentive for a moment, we would have been dead for no reason! What were you doing there with the sickle in hand? Huh? What work do you have there? Hey! I'm asking you! What were you doing in Bheemili with the sickle in hand? Whom were you planing to kill? Tell me! Tell me you! Tell me. Come on. Tell me! Tell me what were you doing there? -Sir... sir... leave him. -Tell me! He is dead drunk. He can't speak a word how much ever you hit him. -Hey you... -Leave him for now, sir. [SI groans in anger] [Anand groaning] Guys... hang him to the roof. You! Head constable... Hang him this way till his energy drains out. -Hey, start the vehicle. -OK, sir. The way this guy was at that place with the sickle in hand... I doubt he had plans to kill someone. -I feel the same way too, sir. -Eh? Come along. Huh! Who is she now? She's retarded. She ran away from the asylum. Hey! Why did you get her here? She was creating a mess for new clothing at a cloth store at Jagadamba Centre... I've got her on their complaint, sir. Alright, call the rehab and ask them to get her. -OK, sir. As you say. -Get going! Enough of the entertainment, come. [autorickshaw purring] -Auto! Rush to Bheemili. -OK, please get in. Hey, where is the girl? You said she'd be here by 4:30. But it's almost 5! Where is the girl? How would I know man! She called, so she'd come! -Hey... -[both] Sir! -Search the entire beach. -OK, sir. Get anyone you find there. Go now! [Chaitra] Anand! Hey! The girl is here! Anand! Anand! [cop] Hey! Who is there? What work do you have here? It's the cops! -Stop there! -Run! Stop you idiot! Catch here. Come on! -Hey, come with us. -[Chaitra groans] Please... where are you taking me? Please! Sir, three guys got this girl here. We tried to catch them but they ran away leaving the girl behind. What are you waiting for? Get her in. Sir... you got it wrong. I'm not that kind of girl, sir. -Please sir, I'm not that kind of-- -I'll slap you now! You are caught in the act with three guys and are trying to act innocent? 'Don't approach the police for your bag under any circumstances' 'If you do, both of us would be forced to commit suicide.' -Get her in now! -No! -Get her into the vehicle. -Sir, please! -[Chaitra groans] -Hey! [SI groans] -Stop! -Where are you going? [Chaitra sobs] Planning to escape, eh? -Come now. Get going! -[Chaitra sobbing] Sir please! Get her into the vehicle! Get in! [Chaitra groans] [Chaitra sobbing] Hey! [Chaitra screams] Where are you running? I'm not such kind of girl, sir. Please! [Chaitra sobbing] Please, sir! Get in! [Chaitra groans] Hey! [Chaitra sobbing] Come here... Come! What is it? What is it now? Hold her! [Chaitra screaming] No! Please leave me! No! Please! [Anand sobbing] [Chaitra sobbing] [Anand sobbing] [phone ringing] Oh, it's the Commissioner. Good evening, sir. Yeah, good evening. Durga Prasad, listen to me carefully. This is my personal case. Tell me, sir. Venkat Naidu, my school mate shifted to Vizag recently with his family. His daughter started from home in the morning... but she hasn't returned. Her family is bothered. I'm sending her picture, phone number and address by fax. Go immediately and search for the girl all over the city. -OK? -OK, sir. [fax machine beeps] When the Commissioner sent the piture of the girl by fax... he was shocked to see the picture... and realized that the girl was not a prostiture but was a student. My mind is going blank! You! What do we do now? I don't have a clue. If they come to know that we molested a girl in the station being cops... we wouldn't just lose our jobs but will also face a death sentence. Yes sir. He is right. Please take care that she doesn't get out from here under any circumstances. That's OK, but what to do now? Let's kill the girl, sir. Kill her? -But how? -I have a plan, sir. -A plan? -Yes, sir. Come on tell me the plan now! Well sir, my idea is... We don't know whom he wanted to kill in Bheemli with that sickle. We shall kill the girl with the same sickle here... pack her body in a sack and throw it in Bheemili again without anyone noticing it. [stammers] and what next? What else sir? There are many love cases that end this way nowadays. This case too would fall in that account, sir. That's all. -Sir. -Yes, sir. Take a decision please. Make it fast, sir. Okay, the plan looks good. Let's do that. Go and get the sack, now! Sir, the sack and sickle are ready. Give that to me. GO check on her once. Okay, sir. Huh! Sir! Sir! The girl is missing, sir! She isn't in there? There the hell did she disappear? Huh? [groaning] Did she escape from here? Listen! Hunt her down wherever she is and hack her! Get going! Sir... we got a call that our patient is here. -Where is she? -She is in there, got get her! Damn! Come on start the engine! Make it fast. Go. Start now! [siren wailing] Where the hell did she go? There is she, sir. [girl screams] Get her in, throw it inside. Get going now. They didn't just book an attempt to murder case on me who was innocent... but also tried to kill that girl with my sickle. I met that girl after nine months. I couldn't bear to see her pain of losing her family and the burden of what happened and decided to kill the Venkatapuram cops who were responsible for this. That's all. I went to Venkatapuram Police Station that night. I saw the SI outside the Police Station. I waited till he left the station as he might recognize me. Once he left, I walked into the station and killed all the constables inside. After I killed all of them... I picked up my sickle from the store room and went to the SI's house. I waited till he arrived. Once he arrived, I killed him and both the constables right there. But I never imagined that one of them would be alive, sir. This is the reason I killed the Venkatapuram cops, sir. [Ajay] Investigation is done, sir. Oh very good! The killer is in my custody now. -But I have a small request. -Tell me. Don't leave such criminals easily, sir. If we file an FIR, open a chargesheet and send them to court... the court would sentence them to a maximum six or seven years of imprisonment, sir. And they would be back to commit similar murders. -Hence I've decided on something. -What is it? No court, no FIR, no chargesheet. Only encounter is the best medicine for this. What about the case file if we do that? There are thousands of similar cases that fall pending like this. This would be one among them. Simple. [sighs] OK. Go ahead. [heart pounding] "Even when time abandons me..." "and the world doesn't care" "My life looks at you..." "and comes for you, come" "Come along with me" "My heart is your red carpet" "Reach me" "Reach me" "Even if the sky hides you" "Even if you farther than the Moon and Sun" "I would reach you soon" "and put a smile on your face" "You are my partner in all my lives" "I'll make this truth ring in all directions" KING GEORGE HOSPITAL VISAKHAPATNAM [Ajay sighs] The constable you want to kill is still lying in this hospital. I think he would be discharged in an hour. Room number 103. If you have any unfishined business, take care of it. Go. Why sir? I thought you'd kill him. But you left him! For the first time, I felt like giving someone a chance. So I left him. Then why did you tell the Commissioner that you would kill him in an encounter? I was not referring to him. Who else then, sir? Drive towards Bheemili. [Anand breathing sharply] [indistinct chatter] [screams] [shot fired] [man groans] [man groans] [shot fired] [breathing sharply]
