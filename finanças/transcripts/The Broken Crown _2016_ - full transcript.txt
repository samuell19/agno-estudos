The time is right for that, because your grandfather Fernando is dying on the other side of the wall and times of uncertainty are coming. But nothing compared with those times after the death of His Catholic Majesty. The Broken Crown Come in. Your Majesty, your wife commanded in her last will that all her debts should be paid off. - So it be done. I'm afraid that there is lack of money. Gather in Toro the Queen's goods and make a starch. Collected amount will be enough. - Nothing will be left of her patrimony. - So it be done. We can not demand from others to respect the testamest if we don't respect it. - Chancelleries are still sending their condolences. They are happy of the fact that everything's running its course in Castilla. - This is what we wanted. However, the Flemish missive has been delayed. - Maybe the new was delayed too much? Knowing the uses of the archduke Felipe, Who knows when he has agreed to tell the new to Miss Juana. Maybe he thinks that it hurts us, when it actually favors us. - Fool! The more time he postpones my daughter's return to Castilla the more time he will give us to strengthen our governance. If your son-in-law hasn't hurried to travel by the sea, then probably something is hindering his eagerness to be crowned. Go to flanders, find out what my daughter's thinking about the crown and about her husband. Whatever it is, try to delay her trip. Chacón, Wait. We need Cisneros. - Your Eminence. - Welcome to Toro village. Come with me. Thank you, Chacón You, an austere man, will surelly appreciate the stay in this palace. You know me well. So, save me the protocol. Why did you want me to come here? - I'm not a fan of you. Many times, I had liked you to be imprisoned in Alcalá, fully dedicated to your studies. It wouldn't exist a sentence more pleasant for me. - I know, I know. But, if so, both of us will betray Isabel's will. There is a lot separating us, but her memories unite us as much as the desire for the power to remain in the hands of the crown, and not in the hands of the great ones. You assume that Juana is unfit for governance. You know of her outbursts... ...and of the passion for her husband so much that her judgment gets blur. My son-in-law won't hesitate to betray us if it's in his own interest. How to know if Juana will not endorse his doings? In order to avoid it, we must give you the kingdom and pretend not to see your ambition. - I won't bless your doings and decisions that disgust me. - I don't need your blessing ...but your help. Let's go together on this, not against each other. Do you have in mind another person with whom to futfil the lasts wishes of my wife? Isabel wanted to leave Castilla's government in my hands... ...big trouble awaits me. Calling her name, I beg you to stand by me. Lord of Belmonte, Should I understand your return as the sign of failure? My presence must not disturb you, but what your father-in-law plots against you. I have obtained support for you from the most powerful noblemen in Castilla. They, same as you, want to evict the Aragonian from the government. Are the great ones on my side? Not all of them, but it's a matter of time - And money, I guess. - Winds are favorable to you, but you have to move quickly. Veyré, you will travel to España. You will complete the task initiated by Don Juan Manuel. As much, or more than the support of the powerful, you need your wife to remain calm and by your side. The Queen's testament gives Castilla to your father-in-law in case that Juana does not want or is unfit for governance. God damn it! Can't His Highness prove her capability and willingness to reign? - Courts have been summoned in Castilla without your wife's presence. I'm afraid the King of Aragón will declare the heiress unfit. If those who are loyal to me cannot avoid it, What can I do? - Move faster than them. Do as your mother-in-law and proclaim yourself as King as soon as possible. - Without the blessing of Juana? - That's the first thing you need to obtain. - I haven't call for you. - Does a husband need to be called? - I don't want to see anyone... neither I want to see you! - I'm doing everything for your good but my good intentions make me to do mistakes. - You lie! No I don't ...and I am sad by this separation that lasts longer than decency advises. Is an unfounded grudge, and even more we have to face our destiny together. We must not delay our proclamation as Castilla's kings. Do you want to travel in the middle of the winter? No, I thought it might take place here in Santa Gúdula. Castilla has raised banners for you. Why to wait? Very convenient, no doubt. But no. Only in the Castilla's courts I will be made their Queen. And now, please allow me to continue my readings. It will be necessary to collect as much support as possible. Kicking out the Aragonian is a task that concerns to all Castilian nobility. - Many, who now hesitate, will take side when the great ones raise their voices. Veyré, Organize a funeral for my mother-in-law's soul. With the excuse of the ceremony, I'm going to proclaim myself as Castilla's King, Whether my wife agrees or not. Where is everyone? Tell me! I order and command: when the princess, my daughter, is not in the realm... or even when she is here, she doesn't want to rule or can't understand how to the govern. In any of these cases, the King, My Lord, will rule and administer the kingdom until Don Carlos, my grandson, reach the legal age, at least 20 years old, to rule and govern. Do you swear Juana as the true Queen? Legitimate successor and natural owner of these kingdoms and Don Felipe as her legit husband? Yes, We swear. Stop! Do you think that the house of God is the proper place for a farce!?! I'm the Castilla's Queen. This ceremony is meaningless without me. Keep going! According to Isabel's testament: Do you accept, His Majesty, Fernando de Aragón, as the Kingdoms of Castilla, Leon and Granada's governor and administrator? - Lords It is not my intent to disregard the Queen's will, but according to our law, does it belong to Doña Juana's legitimate husband the right to administrate and govern the kingdoms, instead of her father? - Do you prefere, my lord, a foreigner to rule the kingdoms? - I'm only attending Castilla's law! - They are both foreigners! - Lords! Lords! I was the first one to recognize my daughter as true successor after the Queen's death... ...but you need to know that my wife's honesty and pain led her to hide the true reasons for this decision Long before she passed away, the Queen, knew of the disease that overtook Doña Juana. This document, ordered by her husband, lists the points why the Queen doesn't have free will. Her addiction disease is such that she can not rule. - I insist, Your Eminence. What stops Don Felipe, our King, to rule in her behalf? Doña Juana's consort is an option that only his presence in these realms will resolve. Because of these 2 reasons, her mother wanted to ensure the good governance of this kingdoms by handing them over to her husband. Lets obey the will of our Queen, and let be as loyal to her as we were while she was alive. When your father-in-law gets to know that you have crowned yourself King in Brussels your relationship with him will deteriorate. I have followed the example of his late wife, Queen Isabel. It is not good for the King to take a journey in the middle of the winter. Why to delay the proclamation? Even for a traitor like you is known that is the right of the Courts to swear their kings and so they have done in Toro. The courts, those where my father-in-law has not hesitated to use dishonest means, telling about his daughter's disease with the purpose of ruling. You say "dishonest means" the fact of showing the passion's disease which afflicts her? For the shake of her children and grandchildren you should have not told. Ah, then you are admiting that the disease exists, and, unfortunately, that she is unfit for governance. Enough! Get out of my sight. - I demand to see the Queen - Never! and from now on, you never show yourself in palace again. Do you dare to forbid access to an envoyee of the crown? I am the King of Castilla! ...I don't remember sending you anywhere! Get him out of here! Your father tells, in the courts before your vassals, that you are insane Don't you see what he wants? My madness was to trust you and not my parents, who saw that you are a traitor. I've never intended to steal what belongs to you, as my father-in-law have done, but to share it. - Your actions contradict your words so often. - Let your words, written by your own hand, disprove the infamy. Your love for me disturbs your judgment, the eagerness to own me, the jealousy. Write it down. - May your father know that this is the only cause of your passion. - I won't. In spite of what it has done to you? They will never accept you for the Castilla's throne if you don't show some sanity. They do, obeying my mother's will. Be more concerned that they obey yours. Here you can create as many farces as you want but, in Castilla, I am the Queen! Take a good look at me, if you don't agree to terms, then you won't see me again in a long time. My men will guard your door. You won't see me again in a long time. You might be the Queen in Castilla... ...but here you are my prisoner! Guards! Guards! Guards! No one gets in or out of this chamber without my permission! Five times that bitch refused to write the letter. Calm down. We'll write it ourselves. The count of Benavente, one of our most loyal supporters. on the other hand, it will be harder to convince the constable. - Leave the matter to me. The King of Aragón take very good care of the gold comming from Castilla's wool, the harvest of your fields. But, what he gives in exchange? Nothing but discord! Both here and in Brussels, his maneuvers shock his son-in-law and even his own daughter. Listen to the letter she sent me written by her own hand. "They say that I have no brain. I know well that King Felipe, my husband, wrote to my father complaining about me. But this matters shouldn't go public, out from parents and children private circle. I got passionate and I lost the status suited for my honorability, this happent because of jealousy, nothing else..." Jealousy, gentlemen. Jealousy and not illness. are those insane words? No, Lords. Listen and decide yourselves if she seems to be sane. "I won't remove the King Felipe, My Lord, my husband, from the rule of those kingdoms and from the kingdoms belonging to me I won't stop giving him all the power I could because of the love I have for him and because of what I know from His Highness. And I pray to God we'll soon be in Castilla, where my servants will look to me with great pleasure." - So it be done. - In fact, to see her among us will clear our doubts and quell rumors and suspicions. - When will she come? - As soon as possible, I hope. Is it fair that the Castilla government has been taken away from her by saying before the courts that she is unfit? - She's not unfit. I think I speak for everyone. - In the meantime, Don Felipe, my Lord, doesn't think in any other thing than to pave the way for his wife. - Don Felipe's interests and ours should meet. - My Lord thinks the same, and the rewards received by those who support him will by sign of his gratitude and generosity. Let me go! Miserable wretches! You can't do this to me! No! You can't do this! Ah! I swear to this cross that I will get you killed! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Let me go! Please, Margarita! Please help me, please! Let me go, you miserable wretches! Let me go! What do you do? Saddle my horse, quick! My son-in-law says that my daughter's troubles are due to jealousy. He blames her lack of understanding on Juana's perversity. He! Who is keeping the Castilla's Queen in custody... ...he has the courage to demand to return to Aragón and to let him free way. Fucking pig! he is not going to step back! It's growing the amount of discontent people getting close to him. Discontent people? You mean: The enemies of the crown I'm afraid it's not enough to keep Juana in Flanders. No. But a signed request from Juana would silence many mouths. - Unless it was in her husband's favor. - Never! I must see my daughter at any cost. - Fuensalida was not able to do so, I doubt... - We need to do it! I'll write to Felipe, I will complain for him to release Juana, Anyway, Fuensalida must obtain that no matter the price. - Is there something wrong, Your Highness? - My father! My little kid! Thank you for attending my call, Father. I can't get the German prince to obey me, and you want me to mediate in a conjugal dispute? You overestimate me. This is not a simple fight between husband and wife, Father. I fear that the future of the empire is at stake. His Imperial Majesty. Your Majesty. I want to see my daughter-in-law. Who has lost the mind... ...your wife or you? Return to the palace. Return I say! You have done enough mistakes! Open that door, for God's sake! Father! Get up, get up My daughter What you have done to yourself!? - Forgive me, please Save your begging for your chaplain I have come to speak as father and daughter. My heart is broken to see you like this. It was broken already before from knowing that between you and my son... ...there are such serious disagreements. My lord, excuse me... It is not love what unites the people of our rank, but the lack of it must not allow hatred to take over. I love your son. ...and I though that he loved me too ...despite... ...despite of everything I've done. God has imposed a mission on you that you must fulfill together. You can not turn your back on God and neither on your mother. Think of her. Think about what she always wanted for you, on the kingdoms. My kingdoms don't need me. My husband doesn't need me nor my children. Nobody cares about me, not even my father. How wrong you are, daughter. Which shadows are resposible of such blindness ? It's not blindness, My Lord, but certainty. Listen to me carefully. You're going to leave this lockdown. - It's your son who... - My son will do as I say Tidy up If not for yourself then do it for your mother's memory, Bless her soul Show the world who you are, and the world will show you how much needs you and how much it misses you. I don't know how you have succeeded, but thank you. I didn't do it for you, but for my grandson. Fool! A husband can lose his wife, but an archduke can't lose a Queen. Be cunning, since you don't know how to be humble. You need her by your side. In any case, thank you. Actually, I came for another matter. King Louis of France agrees to ratify our agreements. You need to accompany Haguenau without delay, before he pulls back and we lose Borgogne and now, dance with your wife. I'm glad that you agreed to join me. So much time ago since I don't breathe this fresh air... Wait here, we'll take a walk. Do you have trust in me? - Sure. - Follow me. My lady. My friend, I though you were in Spain No, my lady. I've been trying to reach you for weeks. - Do you come to turn me against my husband? - No, Your Higness, I come to warn you of the dangers that looms over your kingdoms. And to plead, in the name of My Lord, that you take an action to conjure it. My father made me look as insane in front of my vassals. I understand your pain, you have reasons why not to attend my prayers. But I swear he's only trying to fulfill Isabel's mandate. At the cost of my honor? No. At the cost of reducing your husband's cravings. If he gets the favor of the great ones and succeed to reign... ...then the crown will suffer as in the King Enrique's times. I have already think about it. Do you agree that your father is the best fitted to avoid such outrage? What does he want from me? He wants you to approve his governance with a power of attorney signed by you. I will, but I'll ask him something in return. He must not leave Castilla. Well, if he does so then he will betray me too. Where do you keep it? - The honor? In my chest you will find it. - I will gladly open you to get it! Such a pity! It was not neccessary Lock him up! Your Highness, I fear that the Queen and Fuensalida have taken advantage of your absence and plot against you. This is the punishment for your treachery. Thank the Aragonian If you were not his servant... Release him. I have failed, My Lord This causes me more pain than the torments I suffered. Don't say such a thing. I commanded you with a mission that you couldn't fulfill. It's my fault. I beg your pardon. Go and recover yourself. Those wretches will pay for what they've done to you. I swear. Juana is under surveilance. and out of my reach. - But she signed the power of attorney. - She's not in league with her husband. - She's aware of his intrigues... ... maybe more than we thought. It's of little use to me. Your Majesty, the Duke is still waiting. Let him in. Lord, You have the affection of the House of Alba, My loyalty to the crown justifies that I betray my peers. Many Castilla's great ones will demand from you the return of the Queen Juana and your son-in-law, who is promising privileges in palaces and villas. Thank you, my friend. I just hope it doesn't take long to them to appear before me We come before you with just one purpose. And I welcome you with the respect your lineage deserves, whose blood has watered the land of Castilla. Castilla does not need more blood, but its legitimate Queen. I share that feeling, I recall my wife's memory constantly. - We mean, your daughter, whose absence from these kingdoms has only one explanation The whim of her husband. - No, my Lord! Your eagerness to remove from the governance those who righfully should exercise it. I have no reason to be burdened with such an ungrateful task. So I've made my son-in-law to know it in this letter in which I reclaim, same as you, the presence of the Queen of Castilla. The message will soon arrive to her hands. - Your Majesty, I'm glad to see that we agree on that. I've begged them not to delay the journey beyond necessary. I am dying to have my beloved children near me. They only await the arrival of my son-in-law to collect the reward. Dogs... I was wrong. I won't be able to destroy the Borgognian while he is far away. I need to attact him close... - Give him some power. He will hurry to take it from your hands but I doubt he'll agree to share it. No, he won't do it. Not as long as he knows that I am isolated and weak. My strength is in Aragón There I will recovered it before negotiating. Your Eminence, I will follow Isabel wishes. My grandson Carlos will rule Castilla, I assure you that, ...and I'm counting on your help to make it so. But I must have my hands free in my kingdoms. - What do you mean? - I mean to make safe Aragón, Naples and Sicily from foreigners. - At the cost of depriving your grandson of them. They have kept him away from me, He's no less a foreigner than his father. He is my grandson, yes, but also the son of a traitor ...and the son of an insane woman, God forgive me! Should I resign myself to giving them up? Are you thinking of another heir? I'm thinking of safeguarding my legacy. Aragón and Castilla enemies again. Is not what you and your wife planned. My daughter's husband doesn't just want to rule, he wants to take over Castilla and to take it away from Juana, for this purpose he is up for violence and betrayal. I will first save my kingdoms after that... if that infamous man achieves his purposes then... I swear I will make him pay for it. what are you willing to do for that purpose? As much as it is needed. I'm counting on your help. I'm going to negotiate with my son-in-law face-to-face. I've proposed to him to come to Castilla as soon as possible. Will you negotiate with him while the Queen is in Flanders? My daughter should not be an obstacle, in between her husband and me, avoiding us to put an end to our disagreements. But I will miss the opportunity to take an ally away from her and to end the war at Naples once and for all. I'm in conversations with King Louis. And I'm sure there will be agreement between France and Aragón Your Majesty. You know the French very well. How much it will take for him to break his commitments? Trust me. I'll get good guaranty. If the faithful Gonzalo Chacón had seen what was about to happen... After long years of fighting, your grandfather and Louis de France came to an agreement that benefited both of them. What will end the killing? - My dear Fernando. This will not enough for the King of Aragón. Day after day he saw his power in Castilla diminished. ...but he managed to become main figure in italy. He ruined the dream he shared with his wife, Queen Isabel. You hear it correctly The King of Aragón will marry the niece of the King of France, Doña Germana of Foix. The Queen died less than a year ago. - But if that young woman will give him a son. - As he is planning. - The Prince Carlos will not inherit the Aragonese crown. The Kingdom of Spain once again separated. All that Isabel dreamed All that she sacrificed herself for So much she suffered for it... - Where loyalty and promises remain? - Apparently buried in Granada, with the addressee. Calm down. Don't give it up for lost. Do you ask me to calm down as the work of the best Queen of Castilla collapses? Don Felipe and the great ones intend to banish the King of Aragón He tries to get strength wherever it is possible. - You are wrong! He's just looking for his benefit! They sign peace in Italy. At what price, My Lord? Think about what it is ruined. Will we turn our backs on the crown, as others, while it needs us most? To the crown, Never! To Don Fernando. He came to you invoking the Queen's memory and he just betrayed it. No, Your Eminence. Don't count on me. My Lord Please give me leave from the Court. That is not my wish, I assure you. Not mine eigther, my Lord Then, stay with me No, Your Majesty... because I wasn't born dumb and because I haven't grow a fool. I'd rather not be a witness to how you vulnerate my lady's will, Your wife. Your lady is the past. My wife, Doña Germana will guarantee the future of my kingdom, with the help of God, Today Castilla is as hostile to me as you are now. You have shown your loyalty to me for decades. Your prestige is built on it. And now you beg me to let you go. Will you go to the service of those who are against me? Your Majesty, If there's a traitor in this room... ...be sure is not me. Go away. Your father has married by proxy in Dueñas. Yes, My Lady. Aragón has a new Queen and it's not you. Think for a moment about the consequences of that marriage A new heir will deprive your son Carlos of the Aragonese crown. - I tell you, I don't like these news but it is the right of the King of Aragón to guarantee peace in his territories by whatever means he thinks that are appropriate. - Like this you defend the rights of our son?!? If you are trying to turn me against my father for this, then you are wrong again, however great my discontent may be. Your Majesty I'm your husband, Germana. We don't need any formality My uncle, King Louis, commands me to take care of his most valuable ally. As a rival, he already took care of you. Now, your uncle and I have a common enemy more fearsome than the sum of our enemies: The weather. A relentless adversary. Then I'll easily fulfill his mandate, Your Majesty You won't find a better ally than me against that enemy. Yet... I could never fill the void left by Queen Isabel. I would be a fool if I'd try that. Does His Eminence suffer from any disease? God forbid. Is he restrained by nature? You won't find in Castilla ascetic more virtuous. I don't trust those who reject the pleasures that God has placed at our disposal. Why? Sooner or later, others suffer for those unsatisfied appetites. - The one who governs these kingdoms today is living his best years. A toast for his health! and in the memory of our sovereign, Queen Isabel! I understand the sadness in Doña Beatriz. - Lord, I ask you to excuse her. I need to apologize to her because I have to ask more services from her. I wish she will join my wife's ladies and help prepare her for the difficult situation that is coming. So she will do I beg you. Put our loyalty to the crown before your friendship memories - I will fulfill the King's request ...willingly... ...but I won't do it for him... ...I'll do it because of him being so unfair to Doña Germana, who is not to blame. - I know for you this is a bitter drink, but I'm afraid we'll have many more like this to come in the near future. Get used to the idea. I'll be yours tonight. I'll do everything in my hand for you to be mine until the end of our days. There is no soul without a stain, nor virtuous. I have lived many years and the nature of man still amazes me. You know how little affection was in your parents those days. However, there was understanding among them before they sailed to Castilla, since your mother got pregnant with your sister Catalina. Belmonte and your father agreed to go to La Coruña, not to Laredo. By going to La Coruña, he is trying to cheat you, also he tries to gain some time, because he doesn't have all the support he wants. In the first place, support from his wife. Your daughter requests to meet you. The archduke is trying to prevent it. What do you command? I will send Lord Veyré with instructions for my son-in-law. I'll go to find him. Leave us alone. You'll go ahead, You'll meet with Felipe. Find out his intentions. If you understand that he is not going to give in, and nothing better can be done, then save my dignity, and make it so that he gets weaker and I get stronger. We don't need to give up anything yet. Orense May 1506 Think of my father-in-law for a moment. An old man, in hostile lands, isolated, flimsy, and despite all this, He doesn't renounce to governance. Why should I do it? I'm young, the right is by my side, I have men on arms and, as you can see, I have the support of the Castilian nobility. The courts also recognized the rights of Don Fernando. Let him claim them! I can get him to give in. For the shake of Castilla. A broken crown opens the door to misrule. None of us here wish that for these kingdoms. The one who thinks that the King of Aragón will step back in exchange for nothing, eighter he doesn't know him... or he has the reasoning of a little child. Let's negotiate, then. You'll travel with me. We'll have time to talk. I'd like to go with you. Here you'll be better and in more pleasant company. You are not serious about that. Unfortunately, yes Don't be afraid, I'll come back You have to conceive an heir for me. I may have already done. They may kick me off from Castilla, but Aragón will remain in my hands and in our children's. Remesal June the 20th, 1506 My dear son. I'm glad to see you so nicely accompanied. Lord Count. You are fat! You too, Constable. We all suffer from the same weakness. Are you surprised of it, My Lord ? And the Queen? Your Majesty. Deal with Don Felipe now. You'll have the opportunity to see your daughter. Did You receive the proposal that I negotiated with His Highness. Really, very generous, if it weren't for the quid pro quo. You lost it all, My Lord Thank His Eminence and accept it. You will hold the Lands of Santiago, Calatrava and Alcántara that and 10 million maravedíes per year as Rent plus half of the income from american lands. It is very little compared to what I'm required to do. Negotiate you both I got you a good deal. I'm warning you, I won't negotiate again. Your Eminence has been a tough nut to crack. No one could get a better deal from me. Don't be stubborn and take his advice. I have to leave Castilla like a stinker. No. I only ask from you to return to your kingdoms, once you've signed this document declaring Juana unfit for governance. Do you feel so strong that you intend to get rid of the Queen and me at one shot? Spare me the scandal, My Lord You already tagged her as insane in Toro. Now, at least, it pays off. I'll resign Castilla's government for his eminence's remarkable service But I won't enact the inability of the Castilla's Queen without seeing her first. Be content that I go away from you. The archbishop will come to Valladolid. I need him in the courts. You will leave immediately to Aragón Without seeing Juana? You hid the meeting with my father from me. I'd never have allowed you to defile him. Thanks to my generosity, he's not leaving from here humiliated... ...but much richer. My father is not like these infamous ones, who sell themselves for half a bag of gold. I'm the Queen of Castilla! Your Queen! I command you to take me to my father, the King! Damn you all! Damn you all! I want to see my father! Take me before him? I want to see my father! I want to see my father! I want to see my father! I want to see my father! The missive that you read to us was misleading Unfortunately, the reality is different. Doña Juana is insane, Lords. Her behavior is not suitable for a Queen. - You need to put your wife where she's served and accompanied, as her status and personality requires. That was my intention... when I've kept her out of the world. I want to see my father! Take me before him! I command it! Take me to my father! I want to see my father! I want to see my father. I command you to take me to my father! Should an ill woman reign in Castilla when her husband is sane and capable of ruling these realms? - What do you think? - The same as many of us only Don Felipe is to be crowned King. - Doña Juana is the rightful Queen. and until today, she's not unfit. - The Courts will resolve this - No It will not be possible without the approval of the King of Aragón - I will go to Valladolid without my wife. - If that means going to the Courts without her... - Why shouldn't he do that? - Are you blind to see that Juana is ill? I've seen it, I've seen a daughter who wishes to meet her father, but her husband prevents her from meeting him. My father-in-law wants to turn her against me, Why should I consent to it? I won't endorse such a measure without first talking to her. Do it then! Talk with my wife as much as you think it fits. Your testimony will bring the wisest decision. Father! Father! Father! I want to see you! I'm the Queen of Castilla! You can't do this to me! You can't do this to me! I want to see my father! I want to see my father! Why? Father! Father! Why you don't let me see my father? Father! Father! Father! Father! Miserable wretch! Miserable wretch! Traitor! I want to see my father! Why you don't let me see my father? Have you seen my father? Yes, Your Highness. Has he aged? With others time has been harder - Your mother's absence aged him He soon figured out a remedy, as you might know. So would my husband do, both of them share the same nature. - You have still a long life ahead of you. Castille shouldn't be deprived of you when it needs you most. What can I do for my kingdoms? In thist last few days, I've often wondered that I always find the same answer. God tested my mother, taking her heirs away from her, those whom she loved so much. How could I despise her sacrifice and turn my back on my own destiny. Therefore, do you want to be crowned as Queen in the Courts? Yes, as my mother was. We talked to her for hours, My Lord and she never replied anything baffled. - It would be a mistake not to take her to Valladolid, and still greater mistake would be to separate her from you. - Calm, Constable. Nothing will be done against the law. Leave. I must see my father-in-law as soon as possible. I repeat it to you once more: I won't enact my daughter's incapacity without talking to her. Repeat as many times as you wish! You won't see her. You're Flemish, but you have as head the hardest rock of all time . I remind you that you are alone and that you have obtained more than you could ever have foreseen. My dear son, If your supporters would support you as one man... ... you had let me go without requiring this meeting. Settle for the deal, I do it and since you have aired among the Castilians... the reason for your wife's indisposition, then let me give you some advice: Bear her jealousy as I beared my wife's jealousy you can tell they're mother and daughter. - They're nothing alike. - Do it. Do it and Juana will be just like her mother. She will be a great Queen. Bad omen. I won't settle for this deal. My loyal people will sign what this rascal refuses to sign. I beg you, My Lord, Don't insist on that purpose You are in risk of dividing your supporters. You can't afford that! Now less than ever with the Courts about to be summoned. Be patient. At Valladolid you will accomplish everything you've ever wanted. San Benito, Valladolid July the 12th, 1506 That one, tear it up. Only me is the heiress. Tear it up. Noble Lords of Castilla, Do you recognize as the rightful heiress of my mother, Queen Isabel, Our Lady You are who you claim to be, The true Queen. Legit successor and natural Lady of these kingdoms So the Courts confirms. Then, You will obey my will. Go to Toledo. There you will crown me as your Queen. Your Highness, with the respect we owe you, we have to delay the matter further. My Lady, there's something that I want to ask you now before the Courts here summoned. Your father has returned to Aragón Thus, he renounces to administer and govern these lands. won't my father be by my side? No, My Lady He prefers to take care of his own duties. And you? Are you willing to rule your kingdoms? If so, do you accept your husband to rule with you? It doesn't seem honest or convenient to me that Castilla is governed by Flemish hands... ...nor it is convenient that the wife of a Flemish govern. I wish my father would have stayed in the Castilla until my son Carlos reaches the legal age to govern, as my mother ordered in her testament. But he doesn't want to, My Lady If you refuse, your husband will do so. I will accept on a single condition that the courts recognize me as King of these kingdoms, and our son Carlos, as the legitimate heir. - So is the Queen's will. - Then, if it pleases you, the Courts will proceed to the oath. - You have succeeded. - You gave it to me. You and your father. - Actually, his Resignation. - It is a high price for Castilla. It doesn't matter anymore. You have got rid of him... ...and you don't need me anymore. What's my fate? Same as in Flanders? You are my wife. Why wouldn't I need the mother of my children? Rest these next days. Soon we will leave to Segovia. Stop! My Lady My Lady, what happens to you? I won't come in. I won't come in there - It is getting dark Your Highness, we must continue. - No, no, no, no. - I'd say that your wife can read your mind. - Not much benefit she will obtain from that. - They will ride the whole night. - The Queen provides you with some arguments to make your fears come true. She must be locked up! - They'll all end up before me, - For sure! Especially now that my father-in-law has given up on his daughter, as soon as he has seen the opportunity The Marquises of Moya have decided to hand over the Alcázar without any resistance. Excellent. Let's get back to court tomorrow. I was going to tell you... What about going to Burgos and celebrate my appointment in the way it deserves? Are we talking about jousts, feasts...? Hunting and whole day playing. What are you waiting for? Get things ready Your Highness. My Lady, your husband. What's happening to him? He's very sick. He had already fever when he woke up. Yesterday he played ball, for two or three hours, in a cold place. He didn't dry his sweat, also he drank too much... Let's have hope in physician De la Parra, There is no one better in the kingdom. His uvula is too swollen. He can barely swallow his saliva. - Is he able to speak? - Only when we get the fever down He has complained of severe pain on one side, before and he spat blood. Be honest. What you are able to do for him? Nothing, but to shorten his life. You are doing right by praying, Your Eminence... ...and not just for the salvation of Don Felipe. - What will be the fate of these kingdoms if His Highness dies? Prince Carlos is still a little boy Is it going to be Castilla in the hands of a insane woman? Doña Juana is still the rightful Queen. about her madness... - I doubt that her husband's death will help her to get better, My Lord. Regency. That will be the only solution I won't be surprised if the emperor claimed it in the name of his grandson. - Maximiliano? What does he know about these lands? - Even less than his son, for sure. - And he won't be easier than other rulers. - By law, there's only one possible candidate, the King of Aragón Dear constable. More than 30 years Don Fernando has ruled these kingdoms. It's better to let him rest. Don't you agree? His Highness's cupbearer is also ill. - Has he the same symptoms? Do you think they've been poisoned? - I'd lie if I would say no - De la Parra assures that he doesn't see any poisoning symptoms. The other physicians agree - But the thread exists and it makes things worse. If Don Felipe dies, Castilla is headed for a disaster. - It is necessary to prevent no governance at all cost. We need the right person to take over. I'm willing to apoint this person. Your Eminence, you have great prestige and authority you could administer the kingdom. - Your loyalty to Castilla is above everything else, You have proved it. No one better than you for ruling. I'd accept the asignment because of the loyalty, only as last resort. God forbid! Your Majesty If providence does not prevent it, His Highness Don Felipe will die. I beg you, forget the passion of the great ones and come to rule the Kingdom of Castilla as soon as possible, Because no other than you, except God, ...will be able to put a remedy to such a great misfortune. In the meantime, I'll pave the way, I will put them at your service. Same as once, in earlier times, you had them. September the 25th, 1506 The King... has died. Weep, but don't make a fuss. The Church's doctors say that the soul takes longer than expected to separate from the body. My husband's soul is still among us. It would help him to hear things he likes. Carry his heart to Flanders. Let it rest with his mother. His Highness arranged to be buried in Granada. So it be done. Your son-in-law is no longer an obstacle. Will you attend Cisneros' plea? No. They're waiting for me in Naples. I'll write him saying that I'll come back as soon as I can, In the meantime, he has to watch over Castilla. Few are the ones in these realms who still yearn for me. Time will turn those into a Legion. Your Eminence, I won't summon the Courts, Do not insist! I Won't I disagree with those who claim them. Yet, How I am supposed to govern Castilla if you refuse to validate my appointment? My Father will do it when he returns. And meanwhile, Who governs? Who decides? Who administers? My Lady, I am as loyal to you as I was to your mother, but my hands and feet are tied. - I will sign! I will sign, just one. It will help these kingdoms and to you too. I order the benefits granted by my husband without my knowledge or commandment, to be removed from my books, revoked and invalidated. I command to dismiss the members of the Royal Council appointed by him. None of them will remain. They all will be replaced by those who were in charge in the times of the King and Queen. - Your Highness. I celebrate your decision But I fear that such a far-reaching measure is a source of conflict - We should... - The other matters, when my father returns. Your Highness. I have summoned you because I want you and your husband to come with me tonight. We are at your service, Your Highness. Can I know where, so I can prepare the necessary arrangements? I need to see my husband. Open the coffin. Do you swear that this is my husband, your King? Yes, My Lady. This is Don Felipe. Close the coffin and give me the key. We will depart for Granada immediately. Arrange everything. Nothing but the funerals of her husband occupied the Queen's mind for months. On January the 14th, Princess Catalina was born in Torquemada. But your mother was gone from everything... ...from herself, from you. To be honest, I believe that Doña Juana made a shelter in the cult of your father's dead body with one purpose: To get rid of everyone's demands for her to make decisions. Once lost the husband's sunshine, it's not decent for widows to travel in sunlight, so I've decided to travel at night. Thank you for your sacrifice. We'll have to find a place to live. Tórtoles can't have two courts. I leave the matter in your hands. Children must obey their parents always. I only pray that I may attend the daily funeral for my husband. I am aware of your pain. I've known that you open the coffin every night. The King is the father of my children, Your Majesty. Watching over his dead body, I also watch over them. They are my grandchildren. I won't let to be done anything against them. Your Eminence has told me that you intend to travel to Burgos. - True. Belmonte will not surrender his castle. Don't ask me to go with you. There God took my beloved away from me. I'll never walk those streets again. And now, excuse me. I must go with my husband. She will obey me, but she doesn't trust me She's afraid I will deprive her son of her testament. Passion alters he animic state, But it never deprives her of understanding. Your father and grandfather shared the same problem. They needed the figure of your mother to rule and at same time, it was a nuisance. When he got the power in Castilla, the King of Aragón made a definitive decision. So he did it. The crown servants have made ready the Palace of Tordesillas. - There you will find the place that deserves your condition. - And my husband? - He will go with you. Don't worry. I'm doing this for your good. So, in the future, your beloved children will be able to be as good rulers as their grandparents were. In order to be a good King... ...it's not necessary to be a bad father. Let's leave. His own father... - Yes, He did it. But he settled down in Naples. He dominated the great ones, He took Navarra from the French and incorporated it to Castilla. It is not an small deal for an old King. He'd achieved more If disease wouldn't get him. The obsession with procreation, You mean... and the bad arts of that French girl. Your Reverence. His Majesty. Your Reverence. You will rule in Castilla. Until my grandson Carlos arrives. You always end up imposing your will. Forgive me, I wanted to break the promise I made to you. And God, in good judgment, has not allowed it. My husband, rest. Now we can, Always together.
