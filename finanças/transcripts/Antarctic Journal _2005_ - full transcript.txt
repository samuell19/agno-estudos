Pole of inaccessibility: A point in the Antarctic Located at 82'08" South latitude and 54'58" East longitude. It is the farthest point from the Antarctic coastline. It was only once reached by a Soviet expedition in 1958. Lowest recorded temperature was -80 degree Please... Please... Everything happened to be there... Everything started from then... Min-Jae. Don't move! Rope! Hold the sled! Everyone pull! 06:49 PM December 24th. Expedition day ten 50 days before the Sundown. Who's that playing the carol? Can you hear me? The monitor is not working Hey Yoo-Jin Ni You guys are now on a live on worldwide! This is all possible thanks to our satellite technology. Sung-Min? Can you see daddy? That's enough about you Why don't you introduce the crew for the viewers? I'm Jae-Kyung Seo and I am in charge of the video and digital equipments At home I work at the borough office. This is our head chef. Geun-Chan! What a delicious meal! What is delicious? We eat same thing every day. Actually those are desiccated. All it needs to add water. Come on... it needs special technique! Today is Christmas... have you prepared anything special? We are going to have that porridge again... Our man. Sung-Hoon is a heck of a rescuer. And it is his first time to flying an airplane... Isn't that right? Stop embarrassing me! Without me. there is no communication with the base! That's right. He is the one I take to everyday. Any army stories today? Stop picking on me! I'm not the source of trouble here. I'm going out! We are in the middle of the interview! Where are you going? I'm blushing... Its 7 o'clock in the evening. yet it's still bright out. This is Antarctic... Six months of daylight and six months of darkness. That would be our Lieutenant. Young-Min. over there. The man's been pretty much everywhere. He is a real pro alpinist. I wonder what he's taking right now It's freezing! Close the tent! Like I'm gonna pollute the fuckin' world with my piss... damn White men with their stupid pacts. Captain. you should blow it out. I thought you didn't prepare anything! This tastes like ice fruit cake! This is the one and only ice cake from Antarctica... Min-Jae. what did you do to deserve this? That's enough! So this top layer is decades old... That is even before I was even born... Snow falls less than five centimeters per year... You can't have this anywhere else! Oh, you know something This feels weird... Weird...? Here... This one is 100 years old. Cold... this isn't coming out cold... Young-Min. what's today's numbers? 78230" South Latitude. 142'23" East Longitude. So we have like 1700km to go? We still have a long way to go... You double-checked the GPS. Right? Machines don't lie. Captain. Someone asked me before we left. "Why are you going there?" He wanted to know why I would risk my life to do such a thing. For a moment I thought about what he said then. asked him back Does it look like we are going there to get ourselves killed? He didn't know what to say I told him We are going there to live. Men like us are only alive when We are able to do things where any other men can't do it That is our job and life Preparation took longer than we expected The sun will set in two month With the exception of Young-Min and I. It is our first time to work together as a team. Let's have a drink every 1' longitude we do And by the time we are done drinking this. We'll have reached the point where no man has reached before To Us! - To Us! - To Us! Captain. why don't you give me a chance next time? I even save people's lives for living... Once I stake the flag at the P.O.I. then I'm going to marry Ji-Eun. I guess that Ji-Eun will end up just like my wife. I can't stand her nagging anymore. Once I'm done with this expedition. I'm gonna spend more time with my wife and daughter. Point of inaccessibility it would be the perfect end to my 20 years of climbing. Don't you think? Sure I think you kicked the flint. Min-Jae. Geun-Chan... Could you look for the flint? - Look for the flint - Where can I find such a small stone? Sung-Hoon, look for the flint December 31st Expedition day seventeen It's now 11 PM... But still there's a giant sun hanging over my head. It feels like both day and night are endlessly dragging on... Our days are repeating cycles of walking. eating and sleeping I heard it is New Year's Day tomorrow. But I don't remember anything anymore... I can't even remember he festivities. The sun shines down at us all day long but it's not warm at all. And trails us all day long. When even I look at the sky. I get this strange sensation I feel like I would get sucked into that blue sky I feel like we're left in a remote planer in the middle of a galaxy far away And someone is looking down at us... Or is it just me? 04:22 PM January 4th. Expedition day twenty-one 39 days before Sundown. Is this some kind of mark that they gave up and went back home? It's more like something is buried underneath... Kid! What does it say? Antarctic... Journal...? Antarctic Journal... Some expedition must've left it here Let me see it British Expedition... 1922... So, that makes his over 80 years old. Not only that. We're in the Antarctica Even dead animals of thousands of years are preserved its form It's a completely virus free zone. Kim Min-Jae! Yes, sir? Take it. Let's start moving! Why do you hate Young-Min so much? There is a person you just don't like without any reasons Then... Who is it? Tell me! Kim. Min-Jae. Min-Jae... For real? That journal could've been worth a lot of money if it had been sold to an auction houses. That kid didn't deserve that. Shit... You're really pissed off. huh? But that's really cool of Captain. Fuckin' cool my ass... It's 19:52 pm All equipments are checked. All members are free of injuries. over! Got that over! Take care. over. What are you doing? Is there anything exciting 80 years ago? Not too different from us really... The beauty of the Antarctica. How cold it is. How much they really Want to make it and such... I Knew that... Only few pages are readable but rest... pages are stuck together. So I'm just looking at the drawings. Drawings? So it's a picture diary? Yeah. look... they were also six explorers. Isn't it fascinating? What do you think of this picture? Why do you think he drew the guy's back? Maybe his face wasn't all that! Doesn't this look like Captain? Everybody looks pretty much the same with their snow jacket Everyone looks like Captain to you. huh? My parents passed away when I was young... so I ended up living at my aunt's house. Well. the thing is They tried their best to make a home for me, yet I was still making trouble Then I saw Captain Choi on TV That was after he successfully conquered the Everest. When the reporter asked him how he felt upon reaching the summit. Without any words... he just smiled quietly. I wondered what he thinks about mountains. I begged captain to be in the team. Since you've been away for so long. you don't know the... Nothing. - What? - Forget it... - What is it? - I shouldn't have brought it up! I thought it was smudged... ls there anything interesting? Yeah... I'm in the middle They're going past the 66th degree line. But I find something very strange What is? Well... in the beginning. there were six explorers then over here... there are only five. One is missing... Because missing one is drawing! Maybe What do you think ever happened to them? Since they were British Explorers they must got awards or some kind of medal from the queen So what if you have full of medals like someone? Who cares if you have full of metals if your house is empty! Fuckin' A! We'll never stop walking. Let's gather up in a minute! Let's go! Do you mine? People are trying to sleep! I really need to concentrate right now... so if you wanna lay off a bit... plus, not everyone's sleeping Jae-Kyung! What's wrong? It's me! Jae-Kyung! Seo. Jae-Kyung! Pound Him! Min-Jae & Sung-Hoon set up the tent! Young-Min, follow me! We have to be alert! Something serious might happen! Fuck... so this is fuckin' Whiteout... 01 :56 PM January 16th. Expedition day thirty-three 27 days before Sundown. It will be hard for Jae-Kyung to do even 20 Kilos per day in that condition. How much more food do we have left? We still have about 5 days' worth. But if we drag this on any longer... I don't know... I don't even know what that was. I just felt no energy and it just got blurry. And then? Then... I can't recall anything... All I remember is that I felt a chill down my spine. and my head turned blank. Starting tomorrow. I want you to lower your load, Jae-Kyung. The rest will divide it to carry. Tonight, eat 3 kilograms more. And have a good rest. We'll start at 10 tomorrow... Prepare the meal. Where is he going? Out... What for? He's just out! Eat! I can't. I feel nauseous. My God... Doesn't he look like he caught cold? Despite there is no virus in Antarctica Silent Night..., Holy Night... 01 :51 PM January 23rd. Expedition day forty 20 days before Sundown Are you alright? How is your condition? I don't know. I know I have to keep walking. But my legs won't move... And my head aches from the altitude... But... you've got to keep walking! I know I do... It's just that I can't breathe... You know damn well we have a schedule to follow. We have limited supplies we need to keep up with the schedule or else We won't make it. We have no time! Couldn't we just take a little break? No! We are already behind the schedule! I'm not just saying this I don't think I can walk anymore. Maybe I should disappear... I want to call the rescue plane and escape here...! You said once before... This will be your last expedition... Keep telling yourself that and try to hold on! Captain... Do-Hyung! Let's go. What about him? If we try to keep pace with Jae-Kyung. we'll get bogged down. He was like that in 92 in Roche. but he made it. Anyway, who is going to keep an eye on him in the back. Min-lama'. Why don't you get on the end and keep an eye on Jae-Kyung? You can do that. right? Yes, Sir One thing, don't make it obvious you're checking up on him. It'll hurt his pride. Captain! Ah. Geun-Chan. Min-Jae You sons and bitches! Where's Jae-Kyung? Well... behind... was behind - Set the tent! - Yes Sir! Sung-Hoon! Come with me! How far is the starting point from here? Well... that was about 2 hours ago so at the most, Less then 10 kilometers maybe. Jae-Kyung must be holding on somewhere And thinking about his family... Family? We are family! Didn't you bring any pictures of your family? Family photos... we took a load... I consider you guys as my family... you're like my son. and Jae-Kyung is like a brother to me. That old carabiner... Where did you get it? - Jae-Kyung! Jae-Kyung! - Jae-Kyung! Spread a part as wide as you can! If you find anything pop the flare! Not even ski track Here! Something is here! British Expedition...1922 I knew there was something creepy about that diary. Why is someone that died 80 years ago back here? Unless he was buried really deep. The corpse could've easily come out from the snow bank. Are you just gonna explain shit? Like you have all the time in the world! Look! Jae-Kyung's been wrecked! Got that? So... what do want to do about it? Min-Jae, Where did you find Jae-Kyung's lighter? Over there Fuck... what if Jae-Kyung ended up like that? Do YOU Copy Over! This is the Korean expedition. this is the Korean expedition... Base camp... do you copy? This is K1... Base camp do you copy? Over. This is K1. Base camp do you copy? Over. If we go 150 kilometers southeast over here. There's a Norwegian base. We only have one option. We'll go there and ask for rescue. 150 kilometers... that would take us more then a week. If we walk day and Night. we may be able to cut it in 5 days. If it's southeast radio communication may get blocked due to temporary phenomenon... So what... you want us to wait around forever? It's matter of life or death situation ls changing course that big of an issue here? What are you gonna do if foul weather continues on for a full week? What do you think, captain? Giving up is not an option! What are you saying then? There's no radio communication. and the weather's shit... How can you do this as a team? That's more of a reason why it's not possible. It's not like we didn't try anything to find him. Change the course to get rescued? And give up on this expedition? I know, Jae-Kyung doesn't want that for sure Captain. Jae-Kyung may be slowly dying in the middle of nowhere! If you cared so much about Jae-Kyung why didn't you volunteer to check up on him? You have more experience then Min-Jae. this might not have happened if you'd taken that responsibility instead of Min-Jae. All great expeditions are bound to make sacrifices! Do you think what you're saying make any sense here?! If you keep pushing us like this. We may all end up like that Brit! That's not sacrifice. that's meaningless death! We've come more than 1000 kilos in 40 days... We can't just quit here like this. If we succeed. Jae-Kyung might be... If you'd like to go to the Norwegian base. go right ahead alone! How about others? I will follow your decision. captain. Regarding Jae-Kyung's rescue. I think it is batter for Base camp to handle it. That would be more efficient. What do you think. Geun-Chan? I agree... We came so far... Geun-Chan and Min-Jae should check the remaining supplies. Young-Min, you check wind velocity, direction, and path first thing in the morning. Morse communication to the base camp should be done by... Min-Jae. what about you? This happened all because of you! That's enough... Fuck this! Did Antarctic's whiteness paralyze me? That moment. Only thought on my mind was that I didn't want to go back Other than a week's worth of fuel. camcorder parts. And little complimentary goods. not much is left. What are complimentary goods? Cigarettes! The only remaining cigarettes now are the ones in your pockets. Daddy... This is base camp... Please respond... This is base camp... K1 This is base camp... K1 Young-min! What did you come here for the sightseeing? It doesn't matter whether our man is missing or not! Taking photos... So that's the world of a pro, huh? I don't see why I have to tolerate an idiot who can't even see before his eyes! This is K1... do you copy? Over... This is K1. do you copy? Over... I don't have a good feeling about this. Why aren't we getting any radio signals? Sung-Hoon. He was sending Morse codes before he went to bed... Anyway... I can't seem to find my journal. I'm sure you misplaced it somewhere. Who would take something like that? What? What is it! Young-Min. let's get everyone in line. Yes Sir! Lieutenant. can I take the lead today? What? Sung-Hoon... Stop! Who told you to take the lead? Do you even know where you're going? What? Are you saying I'm leading everyone in the wrong direction? I don't know what you're scheming. But it certainly doesn't seem to include P.O.I.! Well... We seem to be going the right way. We younger guys will get in the lead. Min-Jae let's go! Geun-Chan, stop! Lead stop! Can't you hear me? Let me get in the lead... I think that's probably batter. What ever shit Young-Min! What the fuck is wrong with you? How can you whistling that now? Stop! And control yourself! How can you be so insensitive. and whistle that tune? Being an fuckin' explorer you need to learn to be a human being first! Don't be so self-righteous. It only proves you are an amateur You Fuckin' Shit! Lieutenant! Stop it Guys Sung-Hoon. Nobody Move! Young-Min... you stay still... if you move. the whole thing may fall. Min-Jae and Geun-Chan walk back slowly! Hurry up! I'm gonna fall! Shit! Are you hurt?! How the fuck should I know! My back, my back... What the fuck is this!? No... I still can't locate them. It's like they vanished into thin air. Wait! I'm getting something here from Jae-Kyung's laptop. Hold on! What is going on... Can we believe what ever we see with our own eyes? If isn't so... It is possible to be hallucinate because of certain situation? This is not important right now! Everything has been broken into pieces. The radio, Argos transmitter... everything! Then we will just have to reach the P.O.I. much faster...! If we can't send any radio or Morse signal they'll assume at the base camp that we are in trouble. Then they'll probably send a chopper at the last contact point but we can't even be sure that our signal went through. We can't just sit around and wait to be rescued. The surest way to be rescued is to get to the P.O.I.! Captain... I may not be too bright. but this is not right... We've lost two of our men! This is not it! Hundreds of explorers have died here That white field... People say it's beautiful but they don't know how much blood was spilled here and how merciless Mother Nature can be... You know what? This is only ice and snow. We can just melt it and drink it if it comes at us! Have we seen this sky so clear? It's the Mother Nature giving us our last chance... so let's get on with it... Jae-Kyung's probably rescued and relaxing at the base camp... And Sung-Hoon... as you all know... It was just an accident... What's an expedition without any stories like these? Wait! Listen! Do you here this? Someone is singing! The fastest way to go is Passing the Dew Peak Mountain. We can save about 20-30 kilos It's only a 500 meter hill... We could save a day this way. But Captain. this is just too much for us. We will have to carry the sleds over the mountain... Our condition right now is... Everyone. Get ready change into your climbing irons and pair up! We will reach the summit by tonight! Min-Jae! Geun-Chan! What! ls there something you want to say? What are you doing? They are too heavy... I have to lighten the load. Some strange force... The strange feeling of Antarctica is surrounding us What is this...? I don't know... Where is Captain? Out... What is he doing outside? He's just there... He's just there... Captains always just there Didn't we talk about this before? A week ago? Was it a month ago? Or a year? Even then. he was just there... When his son lay dead at the mortuary after kill himself Suicide!? The kid was alone in their 15th floor apartment. The kid was only ten and fell from the 15th floor... And even in the midst of a horrible situation. Captain was just there. Earlier that night. the kid called begging him to come home because he was afraid to be alone... but instead. Captain hung up the phone after scolding him that he must be tough. That's why he's such a great explorer... Even after failing the expedition before. The debt, losing his only son. then the divorce... I could never do that... Before hanging up the phone the kid kept telling him... that he was seeing something a white figure was staring at him... If Captain was there... do you think that didn't happen? The kid... Did he want his father to save him? Is this altitude sickness? Why am I seeing things? 01 :56 PM January 31st. Expedition day forty-eight 12 days before Sundown. This is the same spot! We must have walked at least 150 kilos! We are in same place as we were in a week ago! But we're in a different place according to the coordinate table. We did climb over that mountain! It can't be! It's probably just a mechanical failure. It must be frozen. I'm sure it'll be fine once I warm it up. Stop making a fuss over this! From now on. we'll do things the old fashioned way. Even 100 years ago. men found their ways with just a compass and a map. If we are back to where we left off a week ago. We will just have to start again! Captain I think... I think We've reached our limit. Please. we must activate the E.L.T. That's impossible E.L.T. is our only hope! If we activate that. the rescue signal will be picked up by any plane! Please! That's for a real emergency. Lieutenant... Do you this is a real emergency? We are almost there! It would take only a week at the most! Sung-Hoon was right... This is crazy...! If you don't take out the E.L.T.. I won't obey your orders! Young-Min! I make the decision to activate the E.L.T.! Your job is to help me. no matter what it takes for us to reach our destination for the team. lam doing my job to help the expedition team. Helping the team? You have forgotten already. Why we are back... Alright, forget it The past is there to be forgotten... But isn't it odd? To me this place feels so familiar. The wind, the air. the sun... everything Doesn't this feel like we were here before we were even born? How about you guys? This smell... I remember it from my first trip here. It only gets stronger... And now its stronger than ever This must blowing from there When we get there she will greet us with her legs spread open. If we can make it to the P.O.I. Anything is possible. Did it ever occur to you that maybe we're damned? What is the point of getting there through all this? The courage I don't want it anymore! We kept on going because we were scared and afraid. And that was the only choice they had to survive! Now you can't see anything. you won't have anything to be afraid. Geun-Chan! Don't give up! Pull! I can't keep this up... We've got to set up the tent. and draw up a rescue plan. We can't continue this. We'll lose both of them. Geun-Chan Stand up! Stand UP! What the hell is... this... What am I gonna do... Weak bastard. Cold... so cold Where... are we? Is this the Norwegian base. which Sung-Hoon talked about? Are you out of your mind? You are gonna get sick! Come Inside! The tent... tent I don't want to be next to Captain anymore... I want to run off... I want to go home... That thing in Captain's bag... The thing that calls for the rescue choppers if the button is pressed... Let's steal that... yeah? What do you say? Let's suppose that we do steal it... Then what! We will live! We have to press the button to survive! I'm loosing my mind! I don't know what's right and wrong If you think about it everything that happened was accidents Just like what Captain said. I still want to believe him You are not on my side You are on Captain's side What are you talking about? If you can not trust him the ski tracks in front of us... you can believe those. Pull yourself together! It's not easy... It's not easy... Stop saying that It's not like something is gonna happen right now! You don't know shit... We are not going to make it. We are all going to die... Who is fuckin' dying! lam not going to die here! Captain is not going to give up Unless we get to the P.O.I. There is no way we'll return home in one piece We might survive if we can steal the E.L.T. and stop captain... That's what I've been saying! We will do that then! Me? I can't even see Min-Jae? Who will gladly put out his life for him? Geun-Chan, can you do it? You don't think I know your condition? I've seen it I've seen it Let's put ourselves together! Lieutenant! Young-Min Lieutenant Where are you? Young-Min What are you doing? Why didn't you do something about this? This will eventually end up rotting your whole body... Just leave it... I ain't weak! I can take care of myself! Why can't you guys trust me? Kids always screw up when they don't listen to their father! Then... the signal The rescue... Signal Now that's not in my control anymore You shouldn't feel any pain now. Young-Min! Are you there! No... No... Young-Min! Lieutenant! No You can't do this! That's how we'll end up Just like them I told you to not to say shit like that! Mother fucker! What am I gonna do... What do I have to do It doesn't work He hid the batteries My head... is spinning... Lieutenant! Please... Pull yourself together! pull yourself together! That's strange... Because everything's so blurry I can relax... I want to shave I will steal whatever you need from Captain. There is nothing for you to take away from him. He will take everything from you instead I wonder why he let go of Sung-Hoon's rope It doesn't make any sense He wasn't that sort of a man It's this place... Antarctica has driven him insane! No... Pole... of... inaccessibility Pole of inaccessibility doesn't exist We were supposed to drink this at the P.O.I. Open the door! Captain! Open the door Geun-Chan! What's going on in there! Young-Min is... Open the door! Min-Jae! You are back! I gave him an emergency treatment But, I had to amputate his foot. He can't walk with us anymore Good! You've got guts! But only bastards hit their father! Father? Fuck father! What kind of a father slaughters his children! When did I kill my children? Who saved your fuckin' life when you were fell into the crevasse. What the fuck do you know about anything Do you know what fuckin' death is? And pain is? You need to fight till the end to get there! Whatever comes in your way. you've got to fight for it! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! Stop pushing me! There are things that just can't be done! It's not gonna bring back the dead. not even your son! There is no fuckin' P.O.I.! Even if there was it's never going to accept you! I have no clue what day or even what month is... and time... All I know is that I have few more days before the sun down My last hope is to get there Captain... I don't know what happened to him Did Antarctica taken him away forever? Please... Please... South Latitude 82'08" East Latitude 54'58" This is it! What is this! If you pull that out. This place won't change into something special! This is just a point... It's nothing but some fuckin' point on earth! I couldn't stop I had to go to a place where no one can come and go That must be the place I can only be there I thought this place was going to welcome me. Min-Jae I thought you'd stop me You should have stopped me I was so afraid... I was so cold And loosing my mind... You should have stopped me
