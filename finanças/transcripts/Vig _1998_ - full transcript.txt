Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. So, sports news is on the air. David Sutherland will have to miss at least 2 matches due to injury. In the last match with the “New York” he was carried away on a stretcher. Yesterday "Indianapolis" beat on the road "Green Bay" with a score of 41:48. Now they have become one of the favorites in the championship ... ...while Green Bay have no chance of reaching the final. "MONEY KINGS" Hi Mike. Hello. Mr Locasso? - Espresso? - No thanks. Thank you for putting Tony in. - Where is he? “I sent him to collect debts. I told him that if he wants to join your team, let him learn to think. It's time to become a man and forget about childish pranks. Good. How long will he study Winnie's business? 2-3 months. I think by the beginning of the year it will be READY. And then we'll deal with Vinnie. We'll probably send it back to the old place. Vinnie will not see the old place. We need to teach its players how to do business in a new way. No more favors. You lose, you pay. If borrowed, pay interest on time. When Vinnie leaves the game, they will understand everything. Vinnie won't like this. This is your concern. When Tony is ready, come see me. - I'll look after him. - Good. And I'll look after you. Bar Winnie. - The coolest - Ronnie Anderson! - Ryan Watkins! - Ronnie Anderson! - Charlie Ames! - Anderson! - Kunken! - Hell! 17. Plus 20. 76. 31. So you lose my entire salary . Yes Yes. Well, who's the best, Vinnie? Doesn't matter. Nobody compares to Ted Williams. Come on! What about Willie Mays? - Joe DiMaggio! - Hank Aaron! They are good, but no better than Teddy Bolgame. And today - wherever you spit - all superstars. They score 250 points, and that's it - they are paid a million per minute. - That's for sure. - I'll pour a beer. Anyone else want? - I'll have a beer. — Jameson is broke. As usual. Your bet was crying. Notice it won't go into your wallet, Winnie. I already have a hand in yours. What the heck?! Lord God! Come in from the yard, from the yard! Okay now! - Hey Vin, how are you? - Rocky! - Angie! - Rock, what day is it today? Seems like Sunday. Yes, Sunday. Yes, but the bar is closed on Sundays. Why did you go through the front door? - I checked you. - Thanks. I will sleep peacefully. Beer? No, I'm tied up. But, Vin, can I put an A on Seitanes Pride from Balmont? Rocky, that match was Thursday. 0, I know Vin. I'm testing you. You're doing great, Rocky. I'll go to bed. As they say, the beer has come to an end. - Kunken! “Nothing, one more horse. So what do we have here? Illegal gambling? Oh, and a liquor sale on Sundays. Your shop is closed. But you have one way out; Police Athlete League Lottery. It will help save the poor disenfranchised youth of our city... ...from turning into degenerates and cheaters, which I see here. - What is the prize? - A week in Orlando. All inclusive. - I'll take 10. - Put a couple on me. - Me too. - What the heck?! Me too 2. - Aty, Rocky? - I do not think that they are degenerates and cheaters. Here, smart man. He will take 5. Hey Pete. The old lady said that you wanted to see me. - Mother. - Well, yes, mom. Did you call me? I have a job for you. The guy who owns this bar. He has been running a bookmaker for 30 years. Locasso thinks he rows too much... „..but the Irishman loves him because he knows the business. So, Anthony, we've decided that you'll be collecting debts. But you have to work carefully, Anthony. - Yes OK. - And this is not a joke to you. I don't need those cowboy things like the last time I called you to Lyman. - No problem. Let's go take a look at it. - Okay. Wait a minute. The cop 's car has been around the corner for half an hour. While we wait. - Yes, Anthony, do me a favor. - Yes Yes? Go home, change. You look like a cheap pimp. Frankie, Frankie! Dad is not at home. My God! - Mother! - What? I'll take care of the bills, let the kids play downstairs for a while. - Where's Frankie? - Went to buy cigarettes. - Well, how are you, Frankie? - What's in your bag, Frankie? - Hello, Vincento. - Hey, Pete. Any news? No. None. Would you like a drink? Help yourself. Salute! Came to check your earnings. - Was the day successful? - Sports day. Yes. Here's the money from football and basketball. - It's all? - Well, I shot a lot, I haven't counted everything yet. Will the boss be upset? - Like a son? - Another year, and all. Advocate? Incredible, damn it! Well, you take what 's yours, you don't have to worry about it. What are you going to do when he defends himself, wrap everything up? Yes, I'll sell this stash, house, and move to Florida. Sarasota, Naples... Ellen is ready for this? More than me, damn it! Hello. Can I have you for a minute? Hello. Vinnie, can I borrow a couple hundred from you? - You play? - No no. For food. I'm out of a job and Marybeth is plowing 2x. But still not enough. Would you like a drink? Yes, but once I start, I won't stop. Understand. 100, 200, 300, 350, 370, 380, 500. Thank you. Here's to the rescue! God Vin! If I find out that you are playing, I will break your legs. No, I'll give you everything as soon as I get settled. Good. I'm busy. Say hello to Marybeth. Good. Thanks Vin. Thank you. -F ran - Yes? and I'm not kidding about games. You have understood me? Oh sure. I see you spoil him. So? He's a good guy. How to get a job - starts to play. Let's call it humanitarian aid. The chief is unlikely to like such help. I gave from my pocket. If Locasso is against it, let him come and have a market. Well, see you. - Guess from 3 times! - Are you drunk? No, I didn't drink. I'm sorry. Give me a towel. - There is good news. - Yes? Kenny Small said that I might be working tomorrow at the warehouse, unloading trucks. Oh Frankie, this is so good! - Yes? - Yes. - Are you done? - Yes. And what? I have a surprise. - Which? - Well, try to guess. Oh, Frankie, what's in there? - 0, to choose from? - Yes. Choose. Good. - In this one! - Not. - Then in this one. - Not. Close eyes. - Where did you get them from? - He robbed a bank. — Frankie! - Just kidding, I borrowed from Vinnie. My God, Frankie, we're already deep in debt! Well, what to do now? Will have to give it back. - Wait, Frankie. - What? Well, put it in my wallet. As you say! - Hi dear. - Hi. Was it a difficult day? Not difficult, long. I hate these Sunday night games. I miss you so much. Another year. - A week in Orlando? - Yes. Al is hustling for the Athletes' League. It would be nice to win, it would not hurt us to rest. Damn, when have I won anything?! - You won me. Now you understand why I don't play myself. Thank you. - What's in the package? - 0, almost forgot. Ice cream with chocolate chips and sweet fudge. 0, honey, I can't. Come on, you're not that fat. What are you talking about?! Last night when you undressed, I noticed a tiny crease, about 4 inches. Actually, 5. Are you pregnant? Yes, a little elephant. Do you want me to show you my trunk? 0, this is the worst offer I 've ever had in my life. But there is no choice. Let's go. See you soon. You look great. - Thank you, Tony. - Sorry, we've been standing in line for 20 minutes. - It sucks. - Would you... Yes, go to hell! You're not even American! If you didn’t sit ass on an oil rig, you would feed camels all your life! Let's go from here. - Hello my friend! Well, how are you? We're getting old, we're getting old. Let's go. Do you remember Sharon? - Yes. - Hi. - It's Leah. - Hi. - Well? - It'll do. - Thanks. - Is my man here? - He's around the corner. Let's call him. I have a holiday today. Be back soon. This guy is a fagot, so don't joke about blowjobs. - Is he passive? - 0, yes. Then I will fuck him in all the cracks. Are you very busy today? Until 5 - no, and then I will take bets on Monday. And what? You have to call work, tell them you're sick. Are you okay? The best. I decided to have some fun with my lover. Second time in a day? Well, you give! Well, then let's go to the gardens and drink fresh cider there. Ah, have a picnic by the pond? Will you watch the leaves turn yellow? Naive romantic. Yes, I just want to get dressed before your lover comes. Give me a crutch. Let's. I'll give you a lift, then I'll pay for gas, electricity and a school uniform. And everything that you earn today, we will give to your mother for an apartment. Good. - Good luck honey. - Thanks. Here, $10 for lunch. See you. Bye. - Hi. - Hi. How are you? - Fine. Is there enough work for everyone? - I do not know. I need grandmas anyway. - My children have not eaten for 3 days. - Everything will be fine, I'm sure. - Hope. - Yes, guys! Today we have little cargo! You! You! You Well, buddy, I'm off. Well, let's all get out of here. Come on. Let's go. The bartender said Vinnie called and said he'd be late. Now what? Now what? I will give you his address. When you find him, delicately, I repeat - delicately, explain the situation. Okay, stop it guys! I said enough! Damn, how much can you do?! Let's eat normally! Shut up! Stop it, or I'll kick your ass! God, Frankie! She would look after the children herself, and not sit her ass in the kitchen! So paying $500 bills with a hundred is sitting your ass out? - Where have you been hanging around all day? - That is none of your business! You've been drinking with those jerks you call your friends! I drink on my own, okay? To yours? I'm worried about 2 jobs, and you haven't brought a penny into the house for a month! Helen, you bought so much that you can feed all the guests. I forgot to say, I got a letter from Tommy. Finally wrote. He's getting ready for the session. Yes, he runs after this girl ... What's her name? Heather. Good girl. - Protestant. - You're married to a Protestant. - Is he getting married? - I do not know. Today's youth now try first, then buy. That's what I like about Protestants. Remember the backseat of my old '38 Ford? Yes, be damned! Don't tell me you took all those Catholic girls your mother told you about. The main problem of Catholic women is that they are on their knees all the time, and they have no time to push them apart. - What same you vulgar, Winnie! - Well, it's my Irish blood playing. Today was a beautiful day, Vin. Thank you. Some of us have to go to work. - Ahty, my sportsman. I will open. - Winnie Glynn? Yes, he's at home. Winnie Glynn? I am Tony Cicero. They sent me from the office. El... Why don't you pick apples when they're ripe? I'm listening to. What the heck?! I didn't hear about you at the office. In the last couple of months, you have brought a very modest harvest. You are dissatisfied. 30 years?! And they are all unhappy. Incomes are falling. I came to warn you. Hey, I don't care who you think you are, but leave your stupid bazaars for your enlistments. I want to talk to my husband. Oh sure. I'll have some cider for now, okay? Glasses under the sink. Everything is fine. - What is he doing here? - It's a business. Maybe go to the market for a while? Only when he leaves. I don't like that sucker either, but you and I agreed. My business is my business. Cool cider! Did you buy it? Yes! 0, I love cider! As a child, I was not allowed to drink it, but now I just can’t stop! Well, see you soon, honey. I love you. - I love you too. - So go. How dare you act like that in my house? You are a dog that has become fat and lazy. I came to shake you up a little. The boss would have shaken you! I'm sure everyone in Riverview would be scared in their pants , but it doesn't scare me, boy. Times are changing, boy. If you want, talk to Pete, you'll understand everything yourself. What the hell is going on? Sit down. A couple of your players are missing. We already discussed everything yesterday. Locasso needs money. Well, let me talk to him. He left. But he sent Tony for a share. Putting pressure on the players is not an option. Are you not pushing? No. I know everything about everyone. What does this idiot know? - He knows who to ask. - So... Look, Pete, we've been working together for a long, long time. Don't ruin business. No cowboy antics, got it? No problem. Now he's going to take money from me? He will visit both me and you. Nice talk, partner. Partner! - Everything is fine? - I already said - everything is in order! Sorry. I'm so tired, I'm going to bed. Well, how do you like the night shift? Dark. You are funny little one. You need to be an artist. Just looking for a talking doll. You will go? 75 dollars. - Are the bets for Monday over? - Yes, the boss will call in half an hour. - Ready? - Yes. - Jin. - Son of a bitch! I had to get out of this ambush. And let Charlie deal with you. I would save 15-20 grand. Hey buddy, where are you? - In the back room. Vinnie hasn't come yet. - No matter. I am his new assistant. - Who? Helper. Didn't he tell you yesterday? He wasn't there yesterday. My wife called and said he had a cold. You are Angie Costello, right? Like Frank Costello, smart guy? Aya is Italian. My name is Tony Cicero. No. I am Angus Costello. Like Darren Costello is an Irish patriot. And when did you become an assistant? The office no longer trusts Vinnie and decided that he needed an assistant to collect... Dolgov. Are you Phil Madigan? - Yes. - What, are you Irish too? - Only black. When will Vinnie return? It's half past ten now. There will be a game in the evening . It could be any minute. What if there is no game in the morning? Today is Tuesday, there was a game last night. Players are either celebrating or looking for somewhere to occupy. If there are some bets in the morning and someone wins, I'll figure it out. Whoever wins a lot will talk to Winnie. - Well, maybe. - Well, maybe?! It's been that way for many years. Pour me some whiskey. And Phil too. Thanks, I don't drink. - What do you have? - That's all for today. Stomach hurt. - And drink yourself. - I never drink at work. 2-25. - Put it on my account. - To what account? I told you - I'm Vinnie's assistant. Hear it for the first time. Winnie will say - there will be a bill. If he doesn't say he won't. Kind of cool. - Curly Angie, my friend! - Show me the money, Frankie. - Pour into the share! - Winnie forbade it. - What the heck?! - How many times to repeat? Useless. Aty, freak, what are you staring at? - Shut up, Frankie! - You went! Let's pour! Pay - and pour. And if you open your mouth again, I will personally kick your ears and throw you out of here to hell! Well, come on, let's go out! No one would dare talk to Frank Patterson like that! Take it easy. Not! Do you also want in the face? So, that's enough! Pour your mother! On credit! - Sit down, please. - Why? If you want to understand here - come on! - Hey, that's enough! - Well, everything, you Khan, your mother! - Enough, I said! - Hey, what's going on here? I just wanted... Frankie got pissed off because I didn't pour him a DEBT. We agreed, Frankie: if you don't work, you don't get booze. Well, I just wanted to get my throat wet a little, cheer up. A couple of drops, mind you! Well, do you understand what to explain to you? Pour him one and call Marybeth to pick him up. One, no more. You are a friend, a true friend, Frankie. A true friend. That's what I understand! Well, okay, okay, okay. Come on, sing. Vinnie, there's a cretin out there claiming to be YOUR ASSISTANT. And there is. He is my assistant. He's an idiot, Vinnie. The office sent it, and there's nothing I can do. I'll tell you what, if he's your ASSISTANT, I'm outta here. Don't get excited. He will knock out debts, the bar has nothing to do with it. - So far, nothing. - This will not happen. 0 God. Call Marybeth at the plant and tell her to come over. Phone in my book. Your table is there. What the hell don't they pour me? That freak Costello said you didn't warn him. Already warned. What the hell is this? The old story. Crap! - What happened? - Yes, everything that is possible! We don't have money, Frankie doesn't come home... ... and then they still call me and say that he got drunk at Vinnie's bar, and I have to pick him up. Then I have to go back to work, then the night shift, .. ...and then this damned car won't start. I just... - Upset? - Yes, upset and angry. Every day when there is no work, Frankie gets drunk as an insole. I just run after him. And at night, when my eyes are closed, ... he comes home with a fumes, crawls into bed and wants to make love. If I say no, he gets angry. If I say yes, I get angry. Do you still love him? Seems to be yes. Have you ever felt so bad? I married Winnie at 18, 3 months pregnant. And after 2 days he sailed to Korea. I saw him only when I was already 20 years old and my daughter was 13 months old. He was brought home on a stretcher with a crushed leg. He didn't want to talk. I brought him Elizabeth - zero emotions. The doctor said - he does not feel like a man, having lost his leg. Then she got sick. Polio. They tried everything: the artificial respiration apparatus, everything that is possible. And then she died. And on that day... ...I didn't go to his hospital. But the next morning he saw me and cried. He closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep. I kind of exploded. I remembered all the curses I knew. But you didn't leave him? No. I know you're ready to go to the ends of the earth for Frankie. And if you are faithful to him, everything will be rewarded in the future. Hi all. Ellen, what are you doing here? Her car broke down, I gave mine, but I myself want to take yours. Mrs Glynn! - Hello, Phil! - Maribeth! God... Don't follow me. I agree, they will pick me up. Thanks Vinnie. I appreciated. Frankie? Frankie, get up, let's go home. Wrap your arms around me. - Home... - Come on, get up. Well, hold on. Thank you. Let's go. - I love you. - I know. - Take care of him. - Thanks. Helen, go through the front door. Good. - I love you. - I love you too. What about Morse? He owes us a thousand. How much can we take? He still works, but he has 3 children. 50 per week. What, 20 weeks? But what about interest? Hold the horses. You need to let everyone play, but let them flirt. He will pay 50 a week and will lose 3-4 hundred next month. And Shaughnessy? He owes one and a half grand! - He got a reprieve. - When? A week or two ago. Has he been paying since August? He got the full amount, didn't he? - Maybe. - Let's see him. - I'm going to see him in the evening. - As you say. I have such a sexy hangover. No need. No need. I need some attention. No, Frankie, you need sex and I'm too tired. You always say that. Is always. Because I work 2 jobs, Frankie! I know, I know, I don't have to repeat myself. “Damn you, Frankie! - 0, yes, what an affectionate wife I have! I love you. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. Everything will be fine, I'll earn a lot soon, you'll see. You'll see. 0 Frankie. Hug me, honey. Hold me Hug. Are you dynamizing me, Wally? - No, Vin, what are you, I... Do not deceive the deceiver. What, you can't play by the rules anymore? I have a delay, I'm saving up. Me too. Oh, God, don't, Vin. 40 per week. Every. It's all right, baby. I just dropped the package. It's all right, come on. Every week. I thought I knew you, Vin. All these years I thought I knew you. Where is my booze? Today is my holiday! I wait! Be careful, step aside. - So, here, please. - One bottle of cold champagne. - Finally. - Holiday, Tony? What more! Friends from the north comment on how I cleaned Winnie's tavern. - Yes? - Yes. - Good luck. - One for you. Me too, Tony. - Let's. You wait for the kid, baby, and you will see for yourself: Tony will steer. 6 months! 6 months - and I am the king in the city, I will have everything, everything! - Cute? Cute? - Yes? It's time to get up. I'm going to work. Mother! Hey mom! Mother! - What? - Look after the children, I'll go to the store. I said that I will no longer babysit! Well, please, I need to buy cigarettes. I give you 10 minutes! Yes, buy me some cigarettes too! Cashing checks. You have a Dallas mower. Good. You're out of towels. I'll figure it out when they pay. Hey Phil, is New England good this week? Little whether that then? They always either hit or miss. Hello. Hello T.M. Haven't called in a while. Do you have some new? Don't hang up. You're late and you look like a piece of shit. Everything is fine. - Rocky, Koni will replace you. - Good. Come on, get up out of my chair! - TM, I'm here again, so... - So, how are you, Tony? What do you need? I need a five for New England and a five for Green Bay. Five? Well, 2 fives. New England, Green Bay. What will you do with the winnings? Resign and go to Miami? I've already quit. Received a small pension after he fell off a train and hit his head. It's noticeable to you. 10 to 4th in San Anita. So? Tired? Well, lie down, rest. Until communication. I urgently need to go home, cook dinner for the old man, or he will kick my fish soup. He is angry when he works 2 shifts. - Well, bye guys! So long, Jackie. It's time for me to leave too, my mother called with the children for Sunday lunch, What's up, brisket? No, there will be rice, fried chicken and a big watermelon. - Give you a lift, Rocky? - Yes, a pharmacy, you need to buy medicines. So long, Vinnie! Do you know why he bets 5 bucks? Because I don't allow anymore. This unfortunate man really fell off the train, lost all his brains. Give him free rein - he will bet his entire pension on which cockroach will run down the street faster. So go easy on him. It's clear? You are on the phone. We have a lot of bets on New England. “so call Pete to give him a reprieve on New York. It seems that I ended up in an illegal gambling establishment? - Do you accept money on Sunday, sir? - Yes. What amount are we talking about? Let's see. What did Lieutenant McGuire say? Wouldn't $500 refresh your memory? - Yes Yes. What is the name of your nervous friend? This is Tony Cicero. He will work for me. With you. Work with me. This is El Shin. He hands over the share to the police. Listen to my friend, and you will learn all the subtleties of this profitable business for all of us. Quiet, calm. No fuss. It's clear? - Yes. - Good boy. - Where is everyone? - Made bets and left. Have you already eaten? How about some squid at Lo Presti? With pleasure. You are on the phone. No problem. Have you ever wondered what kind of shit you're doing? - What shit? - Well, roofing. So what? This is a gambling business, not drugs and not brothels. Even the church sometimes arranges lotteries to make money. And what? Just wondering. Now we will know the results of other matches. Unexpected trouble. — Winnie! Winnie! – “Atlanta” beat “Dallas” with a score of 17:3. Winnie! Hey Vinnie! Winnie, I'm excited, I'm on fire! Where is Vinnie? Went to eat. What do you want? I need Vinnie. I'm excited, I'm on fire! - Excuse me, what's your name? - Frankie. Fast Frankie, damn it! I'm Tony. Winnie's new assistant. He has no assistant! There is no helper! I've known him for 10 years and he doesn't have any assistant! - He told me about Fast Franky. - Oh really? That you are a big connoisseur of football. Yes, he's right, damn right! It's $1,100 and I feel like I'm breaking the bank, assistant! You are a brave person. I'm a vazarte, I'm on fire, on fire! Good. What do you wish? In general, I want to bet on today's game, "Dallas", perhaps ... ‚perhaps, perhaps, 1100, here. - I'm a vazarte. Put another 5,000 over here. - Do you have cash? Come on, I'm Fast Franky, damn it! You know! Well, you'll have to sign up. Think well , buddy. All right, Tony, I'm excited! I'm on fire! Hanson swings, gives a long pass to Fryman! Touchdown! Fabulous! Just wonderful! 6 points! And now about the results of other matches! More bad news for Dallas! “Atlanta” recovered from the defeat and beat “Dallas” with a score of 24:3! Excellent. Vin, have you seen Frankie? No. He didn't come today. And what? I got a vacation pay check and it's gone. I called home and Agnes said that Frankie left at noon. - How? - 1200. - God... - 0, Winnie, I'm sure he can pull it all off. That night when he got drunk, he said that he would rent a lot, earn money and take care of us. He didn't play for me. I told him that I would not accept any bets from him until he found a job. Didn't you look for Ata at Freddie Knuckles's on Parsons Street? No. I went straight to you. - Bar Casey. Is Freddy Knuckles far away? - Who is it? - Winnie Glynn. - Just a minute. - Hey Vin! Freddie Knuckles, how are you? - Ask about Frankie. - Not bad. Bookmakers are not discouraged, right? Yes, it doesn't suit us. - That's for sure. Listen, has Frankie Patterson been to your place? No, it's unlikely. If it does, let me know, okay? That son of a bitch owes me 2 grand and has been diving for a month. - Click on it? - No, don't grab him, just call me. He is a normal man, he will give everything if you reason with him. Do you mean load? Well, you can persuade one way or another. Thank you Freddy Why did you tell him? If Frankie tries to place bets, he won't take the money, but CALL ME... ...And I'll intercept him before he releases everything . Thanks Vinnie. - If I know anything, I'll call you right away. - Good. - Winnie! - Go get some air. - Tony? - Fast. We have a problem with Frankie Patterson. Who is this Frankie Patterson? The guy you signed up for. Ahh, rat! - But not a thief. - I just forgot to register. 5 thousand. Cheap amnesia. I see you are a cool guy. One more word and I'll blow your brains out right here! - Ahty, scum, I'll kill you! - Take it away. - Tough guys don't take orders. - I said - take it away! - Let's! - Silent I said - take it away! Sit down. - Why did you call me? - Yes, this freak ... Shut up! Shut up Frankie Patterson. Have you seen Frankie. This is the guy who borrowed 500 bucks from me. He came in at lunchtime and bet $6,000 on Dallas. So, firstly, he is unemployed, and he will have nothing to pay ... . . Secondly, he was drunk, and did not understand what was happening ... ..Thirdly, I followed the quarter-finals of the New England games, .. “..and Dallas lost by 10 points already. And fourthly, that son of a bitch didn't give him a receipt. He decided to just take the money for himself. Anthony? What do we have, a charity sharaga? I saw the dude and threw him. What a fool you are! What's with the receipt? I forgot to give it back. - Don't lie to me, Anthony. - I am not lying. Think big deal! It's a big deal because I said so! So what about the receipt? I said I forgot! Are you deaf? Who are you talking to? I'm not your alcoholic father! Sorry or I'll rip your head off! OK OK! Sorry Uncle Pete! - Uncle Pete? - Get up! Uncle Pete, damn it! Oh, Vinnie, how stupid you are! Come on, get up. Wait in the car. And don't mess up the interior. There are leather seats. Any problems? No, no problem, thanks. I'll sit still. Of course, sir. It's all right, it's all right. I have to admit, Pete, you got me a good grip. - That's not the point. - Not? Well, tell me what's the matter. This is my sister's son. She asked to be attached to him. And take me away. Put out the door. I swear to you, Vin, he'll just get out of debt. - Come on! - Hell, there are 15-20 pieces lying on the road! Come on, Pete. I have consistently 18-20 mowers per month. For any schedule. Nobody says you're a bad bookmaker. But the guys from the north... No need for the north. You talk like that cretin. Look at you, Pete. You are 55 years old, you are a middle manager. That's it. Mid-level, damn it! Maybe so, smart guy. But Korea has been around for a long time, and no one cares about the invalid of the war. If you swim... It won't take 10 minutes for the cops to find out who put you in the water. If you want to do it, do it. No no. I want you to pull the guy up. By the way, how is your son's studies? Oh you son of a bitch! I heard his girl has huge boobs. I swear to God, Pete, if anything happens to him, you'd better kill me too... "because otherwise I'll rip your heart out. Let's decide on that. You will pull up Tony. And keep your mouth shut so your son can have a successful career too. And so he can visit his retired father in Florida. So, not a word about tonight. Patterson's receipt is valid. You have to be responsible for your assistant. Well, come on, come on, get out. - Get a taxi. - How about... He will call you later. Damn pasta! Nothing, Anthony, it's not that bad. The chick didn't beat you that hard when you tried to grope her. You have to respect the elders. The old man sees how rude you are to me, and he will think about it. - And then he will say: "Fuck you, Pete!". - We're one family. And that's the only reason they didn't screw your head off back in Boston, remember? We are a family. Respect elders. Patterson 's receipt is valid. Frankie never returned. I called the hospitals, the police - no one saw him. He's probably drunk. - Did you bring it? - Yes, 1500, as you said. - Were there any problems? - Yes, he's angry. Didn't want to pay all at once. I said your hands are tied. He'd better pay you or Tony will send a couple of his scum. God, it's good that we're friends! I wish I could work for him if he wasn't such a bastard! I would give anything to bring back the old days. Hey boy, what was that beauty who took your picture yesterday? - Who, Leah? - Blonde. But nothing chick. - She's a whore and a drug addict. Looks like you didn't get it right either. You went! Well, come on, and I'll beat you even harder than she did. It serves him right. Was it a hard night, cowboy? I'll go to Grease's, get some coffee. On the thieves pedal, huh? Something like that. Rocky, can you get us another mug? Not a problem, Vinnie. It is necessary to finish the game before Al Capone comes to take the loot for protection. To hell! The boy took us all by the throat. No no no. It's not just about him. Here you live, play by the rules, you think you are their own for them, .. ‚..and one day you find yourself on the street with a bare ass. You thought everything would be according to the rules, but it was complete nonsense. You talk just like me. And so every day you have to butt heads with someone. They change the rules every day. I wonder how you haven't killed anyone yet? It's better to just send a reply. You're in luck, Vinnie. Mrs. Glynn is ready to go through hell for you. Why do you call her Mrs. Glynn? I see how she presents herself. A real queen, my friend. Here you are right. Has anyone asked you to sit down? What happened yesterday at Pesco de Mar? Tony and Vinnie Glynn had a bit of an argument. And you beat the hell out of this moron? And then his chick came running to me with bulging eyes. Tony flared up a little. His whole life is dust. And drugs will not help him become a man. The boy just needs to get in on the action, and then we'll get rid of the Irishman. Okay, Pete. But if he pierces one more time, we'll bury you too. Get out from here. - What? - It's time for you to quit this shit. - I'm just... - Now I won't let you down. Your stunt at the Pesco de Mar has got Locasso shining a flashlight up his ass. Aya will shine a spotlight for you. Get out of this shit, learn the business, and in a couple of weeks, Vinnie will be gone. Do you hear me? I have business for you. Did that goat Patterson come? I called him a couple of times. Does not answer the phone. Doesn't his old woman work with your old woman? His wife works for my wife. Which telephone? 555-01-99. - What's the name of the bitch? - Maribeth. Thank you Louise Hello? - Are you Frankie Patterson's wife? - Yes. I'm Tony Cicero. Tell your freak to come to my office by 3 o'clock. What? I'm in the back room of Tony's. If he doesn't come, I'll beat him up so that my mother won't recognize him. Hi, darling. What happened? Maribeth far? Was here a second ago. She must have gone to the toilet . When you see her, tell her not to worry. I will drive up to her house in the evening and we will discuss everything. OK. Everything is fine? Yes. It's just that Frankie is freaking out, as always. Well, see you tonight. I love you. Me too. - Hi. - Hey, Ange. - Where's Tony Cicero? - In the back room. Thank you. Hey Vin, Maribeth Patterson is in the back with Tony. 0 damn! - Where is your husband? - He will not come. - Maribeth. - Vinnie, he's looking for Frankie. Long story short, your husband owes me 5 grand! You said you wouldn't take his bet. He did not accept! I accepted! Here is the receipt! I need money! I have no money. Then find your ugly husband where you sent him... „..and tell him to quickly drag the loot, do you understand me? Tony. Tony. Come here. Listen, you have the right to demand money, I do not argue. But that's not how you get them. - What, should I forgive him everything? - I'll pay for it. Not! What difference does it make to you from whom you receive money? The main thing is that you get them at all. No I can not. God, well, at least give him a reprieve. Wait a week or two, and after 5 months everything will be beaten off, plus all the interest will run up. Think for yourself, this is the best way out of the situation. That's what Pete would have done. OK. OK. Baby, I'll give your husband a reprieve. Every Wednesday one of you will come and give me $200 each. I told you I don't have money. To hell with all of it! I'll just find him and deal with HIM! Marybeth, you don't have a choice. Settle for $200 a week... “Otherwise, some sadist will find Frankie and rip his legs out. So, listen, I'll give 150 a week. This I can afford. Can you imagine this whore still dares to bargain? How old are you, pussy? 30. Good. Both of you 150 a week, plus 50 for you personally. - I do not understand. - You understand everything. I'm taking 150 in cash and plus 50 in kind from you. No, I'd rather pay $200 a week. That offer is no longer valid. You pay 200, decide Marybeth! Decide! Think faster. Okay, I agree. I do not hear you. Yes. I said yes". Good. Are you happy? - Go home, Marybeth. - So what? Forget about Frankie? Give me a bottle. Well, what are you standing? She's okay, Vin. And as soon as he gets to know me better, he will fall in love. Good God, I'm coming to you. Winnie! - Are you okay? - Yes, good. Good night guys. - Look, do not swear. - Don't worry. - He is OK? - He's drunk, and so everything is in order. Winnie! Thanks for bringing him home. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Oh my God, Vinnie, what happened? I was looking for your face in the moon. Mom told me that if you look at the moon and see the face of your lover... ..no matter how far apart you are, you will still see her. - The moon is not visible today. - I know. All right, let's go home, drunkard, otherwise we 'll freeze completely. You know, when I got hurt, the moon was n't visible either. It was snowing, it snowed for 2 days in a row. I felt there was trouble. I don't see your face in the moon. Here's my face, baby, here. Helen, tell me, what have I done useful IN LIFE? You were a good husband and a good father to me. I am a bookmaker. Bookmaker, bloodsucker. A person who lives off the weakness of others. Are you going? Honey, this isn't IBM: 30 years old and a gold watch. Here's what I'm asking you to do - ...Take the kids, Tony and Heather, fly to Florida and find a new place there. But what about you? I need to fix something here. Let's go together. Tired here - we're going with us. Let's start all over again where no one knows about us. I can not. Honey, I've always been proud of my lifestyle, but I've always cared about my family. Ellie, I love you more than life, you are LIFE FOR me. I'm scared, Vinnie. Me too. Well, it's time for bed. Let's go. I can't wait for the holidays, I just can't wait. Oh, it's a pity you're not coming with us. Well, someone has to pay the bills for all your pranks. - Look after your mom. - Promise. Well, thanks for the ride, Mr. Glynn. I'm Winnie. My pleasure. You have good taste in women, Tommy. Just like your papa. See my face in the moon. All right, it's time. Damn, it's so cold there, I froze all the eggs! Pour me a drink, Ange? Well, let them go early before the weekend? No. Very cold. The resin is all frozen. Forecasters say it will get colder over the weekend. This is good. I will sit at home, watch football with the children. I took them for a day. HEY Tony, you look like a squeezed lemon! What happened to you? Did that Leah finally twitch your shutter? - None of your business. Vinnie is here? - Not. Whenever you need it, it's not there. Hey, will you leave him alone? I didn’t have time to come, but I already fucked everyone up. If you don't like it, get out, nigga. - I see you're really cool. - Don't, Phil. - I'll kick your ass. - OK, try. You don't have to do this, Phil. You're right. If I beat this bastard, he will hire a couple of bulls to beat me. Phil? What the hell happened here? Tony began to bend his fingers again, and Phil ran into him. To be honest, everyone hates him. I know. I know. - Al Sheehan is looking for you. - And what does he want? He did not say. Call him as soon as possible. We're having a little trouble with the pipes downstairs. I want to close by 7. With pipes? Water leaked in the basement. I noticed last night . So I recently went down, carried boxes. There was nothing there. Close at 7, okay, Angie? - Well, you're the boss. - I'm glad you remember that. Look, I don't know what you're thinking. “I hope you don't act alone. Do you know what I mean? Thanks Ange. Get ready to close by 7, I'm calling the locksmith. Was it a hard night, tiger? I'll go for a walk. Take a deep breath of cold, snowy air? You are funny old man. All Irish people are like that. Izribeth Patterson. - Hey, Ange. - Hey, Frankie. What's so quiet? - What do you want? - Hey Vin, how are you? - Would you like a drink? - You're not served. - Why? I have money. - You're not served. Listen Vinnie! Can we talk in private? And what? I wanted to say that I screwed up. It's a pity. - Are you sorry? - Yes. Me too. Goodbye. Hey Vinnie, what are you doing? What are you, Vinnie? - I'm not your priest. - I was out of my mind! I got excited! No, you are stupid. Am I stupid? You think so? Am I stupid? What do you understand?! You're sitting here all day, picking off suckers and saving money for your retirement! What do you understand, huh?! A friend of everyone and everything - Winnie Glynn! You're not anyone's friend, you're just a pathetic son of a bitch! Frankie! Akhty, razzy Come on, get lost! Yes, he broke a stool. Where are you going, mom? I need to go away on business for an hour. Don't hurt grandma, okay? - Okay. - OK then. Let's kiss. Well, how are you? Shall we kiss you too? Can you eat cookies? Oh sure. - I closed everything. - Good. Thank you. When is the locksmith supposed to come? Promised at half past seven. Excellent. Let's play bunken, I got a 50 bucks tip. Ready to lose them to you, just like Phil. No. I'll stick around here until he comes. Throw it in the mailbox, okay? Angie, don't eat so much turkey, you've become like a whale. And here he is. Have you forgotten your keys? why you did not call me? I told Angie. Why is there a "Closed" sign on the door? What's going on, Vinnie? What are you, an investigator? Calm down, calm down. I didn't call you because I was busy - I had a broken pipe here, in the basement, .. ...and I had to drop everything and fix it - that's why, by the way, we closed. Just in time. Yes. How much do you need today? Where is your assistant? - Went somewhere. - Where? - I do not know. Ventilate. Since when do you wear a trunk? Trunk?! Should drink less. Your brains are already melting. Good. Do you have a warrant? Don't, Vinnie. We're friends. We have known each other since childhood. - Think of yourself, think of Helen! — I protect my interests. Don't be a cretin! Bang him and you're done ! You won't achieve anything! I haven't achieved anything anyway. Anything else needed? Because I need to fix the pipe. Hello. Hi guys. Were you watching us in the park? Yes. It was me. I wanted to know if you obey your mother. - Let's listen. - Right? - Yes. - Good. Where is Maribeth? She went to Winnie's bar for a couple of hours. To Vinna's bar? - Tony? It's you? - Yes! Well, did you feel better? You look fresh. I just needed to get some air. Where is everyone? I closed early. I want to show you something in the basement. - What? - Marking machine. Buying cheap booze... ..you tear off the label, stick another, more abruptly, and sell it at a higher price. This is a goldmine! - Cool! Let's go look. - Let's go. Crap! I'll wait for you in the basement. Yes? Patty? Wait, I have urgent business here. I have to go. Here's your 150 bucks. And now the most pleasant. Look after my lady for now, Vin. I'll take a shower. Go home. Yes? For him to kill Frankie? Maybe you don't understand this... ..but I think that for the sake of the father of my children, I have to do it. If by sleeping with that freak I save Frankie's life, I'll take it. - I'll take care of everything. - Not. I'm tired of male lies! And unless you're going to kill him, then leave me alone. She hurt me. The bitch hurt me. I hurt him. Damn it, I hurt him! God, I'm bleeding. Get out of here. - I... - Get the hell out of here! - I took his gun... - It hurts. - And shot him... - Now go home. I am without a car. - Take mine. In the alley. - 0, God. I don't want to die. Damn you Vinnie call somebody Holy Mary Mother of God... ‚..pray for our sinful souls now and at our hour of death. Amen. Pete? This is Vinnie. Tony, along the way, went over with cocaine and passed out. One friend of the cop brought. In 10 minutes I have. Yes, in the back room. Winnie? Anthony? HEY Vin! Winnie! If you place a bet and lose, you have to pay interest.
