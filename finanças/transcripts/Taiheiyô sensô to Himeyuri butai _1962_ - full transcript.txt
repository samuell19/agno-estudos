March 1945. The tragedy at Pearl Harbor, which marked the beginning of the war with Japan four years ago, is now forgotten. The Americans, who began retaliating in 1943 by recapturing Guadalcanal, Aleut, Gilbert and Bougainville Islands, went from one victory to another in the Marshall Islands, in the Mariana Islands, the Philippines and New Guinea. In early 1945, Japanese resistance in the Philippines was at its peak. The defensive line of the Japanese was limited to Formosa, Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Lack of resources and military forces troubled the Japanese command, which was still determined to resist at all costs. The snow on the top of Fuji-Yama symbolised the icy jaws, which gripped the hearts of the commanders. Breaking the siege will require certain sacrifices, much heavier than we have made so far. Are you alluding to the fate of these two islands? Sure, you're from Okinawa, and you're worried about the fate of your country. It will be a painful choice for everyone. Our defence is centred on Oruku, Pakinato and Kadena. These are the most suitable places for American landings. There is one division in Oruku, a little more than two in Pakinat, and Kadena is almost unprotected. Under these conditions, it is evident that we urgently need reinforcements. I realize that Formosa also has its needs, but I request that one division be sent to Okinawa! Colonel, your request is surprising! These squads come from Formosa and will return to Formosa too! Losing Okinawa wouldn't save Formosa from the same fate! - I don't agree! - Colonel Kawanashi, the divisions that are able to leave the Philippines will all be moved to Formosa for the time being. As soon as the situation on that island permits, detachments will be sent to Okinawa as reinforcements. However, I am unable to guarantee this to you at this time. In that case, we are unable to secure the defence of Okinawa, Commander! But... Colonel, don't push! If we don't get ground reinforcements, I was promised naval support. Yes, but to what extent commander? You can promise me that the fleet will go so far as to prevent an American landing, and that it won't just be a demonstrative event? In that sense, my assurance is completely formal. Thank you. THE PACIFIC WAR AND HIMEYURI CORPS - General, it has been decided. - That's what I was afraid of. For this very reason I didn't want to meet the high command in Tokyo. I understand. But the fleet is coming. And they didn't even rule out the possibility of sending reinforcements, although I don't really believe in it. Let us not create unrest among the population or among the soldiers. - Should I lie to them? - It's not about that. Panic will make things worse. We must nurture hope in them. Dear Toshiro, have you seen Miss Mitsuko yet? You mustn't scare her. Let her have her party in peace. Yes, Kawanashi is right, though silence feels like a betrayal. I will keep the image of Mitsuko forever, she is so beautiful and so pure. This is magical, our island is truly beautiful. We could build our house right here. It's too early to talk about it yet, let's wait until the war is over. But when will it end? And what will be left of our island? I feel as if something is about to happen, something terrible. What will our future be? What will happen to our love? Ever since you came back from Tokyo, you've avoided talking about the war and I don't ask you, but still i understand Our paths diverge. If fate wills, we will meet but I think that from now on it is useless to think about the future. If war alienates us and divides us, I will still find you, wherever you are, I will feel your closeness, even in the worst moments, yes, even if you should die. And I'm not afraid, I'll never be afraid, I swear! They are already here! To the fields! - That's awful. - This way! Yoko! Come on, pick up the cart! Yoko! Yoko! Courage! Water quickly! Yoko, where are you? Yoko! What happened? - Oh, Mitsuko! - Will the leg be broken? - I don't think so. Professor, our school is on fire! Run away! Just go with them! Run away! I'll take care of your sister! - Go and see our doctor. - Yes. - Come on, run! - Come! - Let's go, Miss! - It's nothing, Yoko! - Thank you. - We have to save the school! - Yoko, hold on! - Yes, yes, let's go, hurry! Get up! Run in different directions! There! Mitsuko, watch out! - Kuniko! are you hurt Answer! - Kuniko! - She is dead! Go see if there are any more wounded! Mr. General, a message arrived from high command. Its content is so serious that I wanted to introduce it to you immediately. What is it about? Speak, we listen! Command has confirmed that there is no longer any way to send us reinforcements! What? Gentlemen, the hopes we had placed in the possibility of receiving reinforcements were vain. But our duty as Japanese soldiers he orders us to continue the fight for our country and for our emperor. General, I have a suggestion. I'm listening. So, in case of disembarkation, the aerodrome becomes our vital place. Can you entrust me with his defence? But how do you want to defend him? Without soldiers? Yes. And I think I will succeed. I have an idea to call all the inhabitants capable of fighting to defend our island! - That's a good idea if they had guns. - Civilians are useless! That's not true, General! I was born here and I know my compatriots. They are ready to defend their land even at the cost of their lives! That is right. - Do it. - Thank you. Inafuku and this is my unit, at your command! Thank you. Mitsuko, I would also like to swim and not just watch others. Just be patient, wait until your leg is quite healed. But I'm walking fine now, see? - Toshiro! - How are you? - Mitsuko, Toshiro is here! - Yoko! Are you healthy already! - You're almost fine. - Hello. - Mitsuko! - Welcome. We worked on digging trenches. Great. They all belong to the "Star Lilies" section, which is a student association. And under your leadership they work wonders! Mitsuko, do you know that Toshiro relies on you a lot? I know. I asked the headquarters if they could include us in the auxiliary corps. - Do you think they will agree? - Yes. They have already decided in that sense. Great, we'll all be under Major Toshira's command! Not that! You will be under the command of Mitsuko! - You know all exams have been postponed. - Okay, I couldn't do anything! - Me neither! - Be quiet! - Now we are soldiers! - Enough! Silence! Based on the intensified air bombardment of the island, it could be concluded that the landing of the Americans would not be long in coming. The civilian population began to leave the coastal areas en masse and took refuge in the mountainous interior. There they are, coming back! They are killing us all! Mum! Mum! Hiroshi! Hiroshi! Hiroshi! I can't any more. Mum! Mum! Telegram. The command informs that the fleet will soon move to the waters off Okinawa. - Did that come from Tokyo? - From headquarters? - Yes sir. Well, they kept their word. I almost couldn't believe it! So we needed that to boost our morale a bit! It made me happy. But on the other hand, I warn you against unfounded enthusiasm. For I do not think that the fleet would have succeeded in preventing the landing. The situation still remains serious. Major, our entire fleet is ready to rush to our aid! - Is it true? - Yes, it is confirmed. Radio message from the General Staff. - Yes Yes. - So it's true, the fleet is here. So that's what we needed! Banzai! - Long live Japan! - Long live! Banzai! The landings took place before the Japanese flotilla could in any way to intervene against US naval forces. The Americans could not find a single trace of the enemy for over three hours and were thus able to advance undisturbed towards the fort of Suri. Prepare the third section for a counter-attack! Yasuzo, cover us! For Okinawa! For Japan! - Banzai! - Forward! Banzai! - Mate! - Yoshio! - Courage, Yoshio! - Hold on, hold on. - Pull him, grab him! - Yes. You can't do anything at all! So they sent me a nice help, such a lemur! And you, what are you staring at me like that? Stop yelling! Show us yourself how it's supposed to be done! Look to help others! - Koshina. The doctor will come right away. - From the first company, is anyone here now? - Yes, they are here. - And how many are there? - Where are they from? Show them to me! Maybe my son is among them! No, you can't move! Keep calm! Have a mind! I'll let you know when it's here! Hold him tight! Sisters! Nurses! Pass it on! What do you want? So what about you? This is horrible, so much blood everywhere! - And what are we going to do about it? - It scares us! You have to get used to it! Compared to their suffering, what does yours mean? Sergeant Shuki, of the first battalion, with twenty-five wounded. Good. Help them down. Yoshio! Yoshio! Where did you get it? Yoshio. Your sister is here. Yoshio! You don't recognise me? My arm hurts. - Losses are hard? - Unfortunately yes. - We will take care of them as best we can. - Thank you. - Lieutenant, should we help them down? - Yes, we are going too. What are you looking at with your mouth open! Run for the stretcher! There's no more room here, we're full! Take them away! - That pig lets them squeal! - God, get him here, Sergeant! He's my brother! He needs surgery right away! Otherwise he will die! - There is no more room here! - Please! Take the stretcher away! Clear the passage! Sergeant! He's still a boy! You have to save him! Shut up! Why are you getting involved? Don't be mad at the poor guy, he's right! - Like you've all lost your heart! - I give orders here! Huso! Please, Dr. Takali, do something! - I'm going to die, damn war! - Don't talk nonsense! You'll get well, you'll see! You'll get over it! Japan needs living soldiers and not dead heroes! And you, what the hell are you doing here I want to give you something. Here is the watch, deliver it to my wife. He lives in Suri. She is so young. She had no one in the world but me who will take care of her now? Don't despair! The doctor will cure you, you won't die! You must be brave! A total of five units landed. So far we have managed to prevent them from merging. However, defence is not enough. - They need to be attacked with commando style attacks! - This is absurd! If we don't have enough squads for normal defence, we can't weaken them with these actions! - This will cause more damage to the enemy. - We'll wait for the Navy! And in the meantime, we have to hold on! Forward! - Commander! - What is? The General Staff orders a withdrawal. Try to reach area 36. Let me go! - Go. - What? Why should we retreat? Commander, do we have to listen? What kind of atrocity is this? Idiot orders don't have to be obeyed! Is it so? It is a decision that is based on an assessment of the situation, and therefore it is the right one! I know it's hard! Yamado, you will take the southern route. I will go east with the wounded. - God, what a shame! - I'll leave the wounded But what are we going to do? That's how we Americans are they will think of as frightened Kunikos. - In the hospital and I'll come to see you! Enough, Inafuku, and move! Fast. Will you stop begging for water? Don't you know that it is accurately calculated? - Sergeant, - What about you? - We're almost at the bottom! - What? - Yes. - Do you feel up to going to get her? - Yes. Then go! Sergeant, can I go with him? Do you agree? - Can I go too? - Just go girls. - Doharo, I'm interceding. - Sure! - Thank you. - Thank you, doctor. - Let's go! Follow me. Quick, run! Forward! Are they Americans? They shouldn't be here. Lets go! Don't make a fuss! That's fantastic, they're feminine! - Yes! Auxiliary forces from the hospital! - Hello! - Hello, Major! - Is the hospital close yet? Yes, this way. Our professor is here! Singiosan! Professor, are you hurt? They don't get on my skin! I am proud of you! So have you finally learned to obey orders? Yes Yes. Attention, to the ground! But where did you go, at night and under fire? We set off to get water. Almost everything is missing in the hospital. - Come back, - Stop! It's dangerous! Kyoko! Come back! Kyoko! Kyoko! Kyoko! Kyoko. Kyoko. It is my fault. I should never have let them go there. There was no water and someone had to go get it. You stay here. I will return to the positions. Once you are able to grab the weapon again, you will also return. Good luck, Major. - Tumo. - Commander. - Come here. - Command. Toshiro! Can't wait for Mitsuko? She went to the crossroads for more wounded. She will definitely be back soon and will be happy to see you. It would please me too, but I have to follow my men to the hills. Tell Mitsuko that I hold her in my heart. And you Yoko take care of your sister. - Yes. Let's go, Tumo. What's going on!? More flyers! They are asking us to surrender! They want to demoralise us completely. But maybe the war is over. It is not true. Have they signed peace yet? This must be a scam! - Here it is written that Japan has already lost the war. - Yes? - It is possible. - But yes. Show me. - It's written here. - So someone explain it to us, is it true? - Give me the flyer! Read it, Mitsuko! It can't be true that we lost the war! - They are all lies! - What are these flyers? And why are you crying? Read me what it says! I have a right to know! What does it say? Yes, I'll read it to you. No, don't read it! These are just lies! These are just tricks of the Americans! We have nothing against the Japanese people! We are your friends and we are ready to help you! Go home, the war is lost! This song of yours tells you that we want to be your friends! You have no right to do that! This is our song, not yours! Toshiro. - I'll make a connection right away. - One more moment, Commander, please. The connection does not work, the line must be disconnected. - Site 3 doesn't respond to orders. - There is an urgent message. - From Tokyo? - Yes, sir. - Telegraphic message from the Emperor's General Staff. - Give it to me. - Please. - Thank you. - May I move away? - Yes. "Our armoured battleship 'Yamato', a cruiser and eight destroyers are sailing towards the American fleet." What? Are they sending 'Yamato' there? That's unbelievable! They promised us that and they wanted to keep their word. But now, unfortunately, even deploying 'Yamato' cannot solve the situation! The flagship was doomed to a needless sacrifice! We must have no illusions. - We will support its intervention with all our aircraft. - Do I risk losing planes? The moment has come. Now or never. But then we can't defend the island without planes! - There is no other way. - I'm thinking of Okinawa! - Gentlemen! The general is responsible for the decision. I've already made up my mind. The air force will support the fleet even if we have to sacrifice it. After all, you know very well that we will all be sacrificed! 'Yamato' was the largest Japanese ironclad, the pride of the Imperial Navy. The military clash was unheard of fierce. Japanese suicide pilots inflicted heavy losses on the Americans, so-called kamikazes, who plunged headlong into enemy ships with their explosive loads. In the Battle of Okinawa, more than nineteen hundred of them were sacrificed. The fate of our armoured ship 'Yamato' is complete. The flagship also sank with two thousand five hundred men. It is our duty to engage the enemy if possible in order to furnish the supreme command time to organise the defence of the central islands. The enemy must pay dearly for his victory. That's the only reason we can fight for now. Banzai! - Mitsuko! - What's the matter? Order from headquarters. Thirty of you will go to Unkamin to pick up the wounded, immediately. - But that's right on the front line. - Yes. The order is clear: we must leave now. I'm asking for a volunteer. I will take all who are willing to go. I wish you good luck. - Thank you, we'll need it! - Mitsuko, I want to go there! I will guide you. Fast! Maybe someone is still alive! Take a good look! Their rescue depends on us! Courage! We will split into two groups. You look over there, at the back. - Yes, go. So go! - You come here. Check them all out. Quick, hurry! I can't watch this, it's horrible! - It's horrible! - Calm down. Don't lose heart. Come here, it seems to me that there is one alive! Down there! Search here and on the other side! - Tanks! Hide! To the ground! - Fast! To the ground! Behind the bushes! Lie down on the ground! And don't move! They won't see us! Don't move! Run to the trench, back there! - Yes, we're going. - Further forward! Crouch down! Forward! Quick to the trench! Run away! Get out of here! Fast! Yoshiko! Move or they'll kill us too! Don't stay here! Run away, now! Get out of here! Yes, good, - I made a note of it, I'll pass on the message right away. - General staff, but in a flash. - Give me Colonel Harada! - Good. I understand. Sure. - I am Major Toshiro Izumi. Colonel! - Immediately. Command. Can you hear me, Colonel? Speak up. What is it? I would like to point out that a strategic retreat is not possible in the current situation. We have no choice but to resist to the last man. Arrange to evacuate the hospital and then retreat! Hospital evacuation? But we are unable to protect them! You will do everything you can! Prevent the heavily wounded from falling into captivity! did you understand - Did he understand? - Command! Attention, listen! We'll have to lay down our weapons, but first we need to evacuate the hospital! One pill to this the one above too. They don't have much time left anyway. This one. No. This one too. Thank you. Don't be sad for me. One day we will meet again! Take courage. I wish you luck and so that you can live in a better world than this one. - So, are you ready? - Yes. Go ahead. Let's go! Come on! Why stay? What are you waiting for? Sup, let's not waste time! Let's go, let's go! Quick baby, you can't stay here. Come on. - Attention! Get on the ground, everyone! - To the ground! Down! But no, they are ours! Well no, it's a nice meeting! Hi girls! It's them! We are coming to you! Kuniko! Yasuzo! Glory! These are Major Toshira's men! Mitsuko! Your sister is here! Ah, finally! - This way! - Mitsuko! - Mitsuko! - Yoko! It's a reunion! Poor little thing. Toshiro! We were so happy! Will those times never come back? Split up! Fast. We need to distract ourselves! Run around the neighbourhood! As far as possible! Fast! Run! Get out of here! Far! Fast! As far as possible! Don't run all together! Come on! - Run! - So fast! This way! Hurry, hurry! Away! Even further! Run away! Forward! Help me. Wait, lean back... Keiko! - My eyes! My eyes! I don't see anything! - Keiko! It's me, Mitsuko! Put your hands away, now! Give me the bandage, quick! - Keiko! Mitsuko! What should we do? - Keiko, don't scream! Be brave! - Calm down. We'll take her aside. Don't worry. - Mitsuko! - Mitsuko! - So, and you, Yoko, try to find a doctor! - And take her with you! - Yes. - Be brave. - Come on, Keiko, we're here, at your place. - Mitsuko! - I will go with you too. - Mitsuko, where are you going? Stay with us! Do you want to fight? You can't do anything anyway! I have had enough! I can't keep running, I want to fight! What are you doing, are you crazy? Kiyo! Come on! Okura! - See if he's still alive. - Yes! Suzuki! Suzuki! Answer! Keiko! Shigumo, hurry! I'm on my way! Don't go there! Come on! Gentlemen, I have called you here to bid you farewell. For eighty-two days we defended Okinawa, shoulder to shoulder, at the cost of immense sacrifice. This battle will become a famous page in our history and you wrote it. - Colonel Harado! - Yes sir. - Lieutenant Fubo. - At your command! You have been chosen to perform a ritual act. Remain available to the General and me. - Yes. - Yes, sure. To Colonel Kawanashi, Major Izumi, rally the men for the final battle. Kawanashi, if I lead a frontal attack against them, you can attack them from the side. I agree. Now suddenly we understand each other. Too bad we don't have much time left. Maybe we will have him in another life. Yes. Goodbye, my friend. OK, lets go! Yes, I hope we get some sleep today. Just no noise please! Damn! Now they have revealed us, so we must attack them! - Are you ready? - Yes. Now is the time! It's up to us! On the attack, forward! Banzai! Banzai! Banzai. Nothing. I don't see anyone. - I'll help you. - Yes, hold her. - I will take care of it. Who knows where they are. To the ground! Before death cleanses me, my last thought, my loving thought goes out to our suffering country. I am ready. - Long live Japan! - Long live Japan! - Colonel! - Yes. Now relax. It's completely deserted here. There! Aircraft! Attention! Attention! America's High Command is speaking to you! Men and women of Okinawa, lay down your arms! Surrender! You fought like heroes and will be treated with respect. However, any resistance would be useless now! - The war on your island is over! - Mitsuko, Did you hear that? What should we do? Mitsuko, - Mitsuko, what will happen to us? - Where are we going? It's all over now. It had to be this way, now there is no hope. - No. - But I don't want to live like this. Does it never end? Will they kill us again? That will be the end, forever. Mitsuko, where are they sending us? I am worried! There is no one left here, only the dead. You're right. There is no future for us. The only solution is here to die. Don't cry, believe me. We have to leave with a smile. I'm afraid. I know Yoko, but think of what you will achieve eternal peace. So I'm smiling now. It's time. Yes, we are ready. THE END
