THREE FACES Hi, Maedeh. Sorry to drag you here. You are really my best friend. The only person whom I trust. I'm asking you to forward this message to Behnaz Jafari. Please. It's very urgent. Hello, Madame Jafari. I am Marziyeh Rezaei. From the village of Saran. In the surrounding area of Mianeh. I don't know... I don't know how to tell you I don't know... I love the cinema since very young. I've always dreamed of being an actress I fought for that. I've studied with all my strength. I passed the competition at the conservatory. In a very good position, in Tehran. But everything has changed. My family and my fianc?'s have let me go. My mother told me that if I married, I could do whatever I wanted. I accepted. But they betrayed me. They have all betrayed me. I've decided to contact you. I wanted to call you to beg you to come here and try to convince them. My family knows your movies and your series. They see you every night on TV. They laugh and they cry with you. They would have listened to you. I called you. Several times. It was useless. You don't pick up. You haven't answered my texts. I don't see any way out. I beg your pardon. Sorry. Thank you for listening to the end. I never received anything from her. Neither on Instagram nor on Telegram. Nothing at all. I spent the night dissecting this damn phone. I would have a trace, if she had tried to reach me. If she is dead, how could she send me that? She talks about her girlfriend at first. They had to meet in the cave. She did that before the other arrived. And her girlfriend sent it to you. We must hold up there. We'll know. Since she says she has my number, why didn't she send it to me directly? Where did she get your number? I don't know. If you had picked up, none of that would have happened. I am Azeri like her, she must have wanted to use me to reach you. She could have spoken to you from the start. Why us she mixed with that? As she wanted to become an actress, she had to rely on your empathy. And then, her family must know the actors better than those who are behind the camera. Can I ask you to call back the girl she's talking about at first, Maedeh? I tried several times. Her phone is off. You see? And if it was a hoax, Mr. Panahi? Last night, when I received it, it shocked me. I looked for you. I learned that you were shooting. I called the director. She phoned everywhere, even Mianeh's morgue. No result. The morgue, what an idea? In this kind of case, even in Tehran, the authorities take this in hand and everything is done on the sly. They botch the file to not make waves. So, up country like that, who knows what could have happened? She may have called you on another number. I often change numbers because they harass me. I give the old ones to friends. I would have been told if there had been a call of this kind. It's strange, everything seems true. Nothing to doubt. But where do they come from this rope and this branch? She carried them alone? When you want to commit suicide, one manages. It's not difficult to find a rope and a branch. She has planned everything. The branch looks too thin to support her weight. Apparently not. You want to see the end again? I have the impression that the shot from the fall to the end is edited. Can you stop to watch carefully? This passage, please. I need to find a place where I can stop. Okay. Everything looks true to me And at the moment of the fall, I don't see a cut. One should be a real pro to succeed with such a montage. I don't see her doing that in her one-horse town. It's not an amateur job. Good evening, Jafar. - Good evening. Okay? - And you? Is this crazy girl with you? I'm not OK at all. I only have one day on this set with 50 people waiting. She's left us in the lurch and doesn't answer the phone. I can't believe it, my shoot is blocked. I understand, but she is doing very badly. I didn't want to bring her with me. But as soon as she knew I was leaving, she jumped in my car. I didn't have a choice. But in the state she's in, she wouldn't have been very useful to you. I conducted the investigation on this girl. I know. There is no trace of her all. And she wants to know nothing... You know what a shoot is... Is the morgue telling you that? Yes, I called them. Nothing that matches her description in the region. I dunno... We've all been very worried. But on top of that, this nut has struck out and left us in the lurch... We're arriving in a mountainous area, I don't know if there'll be any signal. I'll let you know as soon as we know more. I'll call your assistant. She went down. She's feeling bad. She's having a walk outside. Try to help me. Okay. Keep me informed. I promise. You've nothing else... You have no other scenes to shoot, waiting? I have one day here and she is in it. Put yourself in my place. I have no other scenes to shoot. She's stuck, it's a thing. But she answers the phone! You know, some silver lining. You'll find a solution. I even hope you will win. Sorry, but here I have my mother who's trying to call me. I have to call her to reassure her. I'm sorry, she's worried. Greet the team for me. See you soon. Hi, Mom? Good evening, I was online when you called. You're okay? Where did you go? Me? Nowhere. Why? I'm worried about you. You must warn your mother when you leave. You could come and see me anyway. I can't. I am traveling with a friend. With a friend? It seems like you went to make a movie. No, mom. It's not true. All rumors. You're telling tall stories, to me too, now? But what's the matter? Still, you can't tell your mother what you make. I'm your mother, yes or no? I'm calling you, they spin me a line. Don't worry like that. I need you to give me some news, that you'll come to see me. I'm alone. But I, I always come to see you, mum. There, I had to go on a trip. I'm not making a film. Be quiet. If one day, I decided to do it, you'd be the first to know, promise. You need to keep me informed. When you don't come, I'm not well. I wonder what you're doing. Listen, mom. Now, I really have to go. Will you be OK? Do you want to hang up? Good, goodbye. Kisses. Goodbye. Goodbye. Can I have your cell phone? Thank you. I called you. Many times. Thank you for listening to this message... I slept a lot? Hello. Not bad, yes. Can you open the hood? This is the last button. Thank you. Is it still far away? Behind this mountain, I believe. I propose that we begin by the village cemetery. If she's dead, we will find a loved one. Or, if she's buried, there will be a recent grave. Why go to the cemetery? We'll question the first one we meet. But if she lied, or if her family has covered up the case to save her honor, we'll have a hard time. They can hide everything, except the body. Whatever they do, it will be known. I prefer to go see if she's at the cemetery. Otherwise, she'll have to deal with me, the little bitch. If it is, you too... Me too, what? It's not long ago, you came to my house with Tahereh. You told me that you were preparing a scenario about suicide. - So what? - And that there would be a role for me. So what? Nothing. Nothing at all. - Hello. - What can I do for you? The village of Saran, where is it? I don't speak Persian. Tell me in Turkish. Sorry, I don't speak Turkish well. That's why... Yes, you speak very well. We don't forget our mother tongue. Okay, I'm trying. Tell me, wasn't there a drama here, recently? Hush! - Why? - Klaxonne. - What? - Give a toot. A horn toot? Two, now. Two toots? Two toots? Longer. - What? - Klaxonne longer. Why? You can go. Where? Which way... to go to the village? You go up the hill, you go back down the other side, until you reach the bottom. There, you turn right, It will be there. Thank you very much, goodbye. You asked him? Yes, but... Did you see? What? There's a marriage. They can get married. They wouldn't have done it, if there had been a death. They may come from another village. Here, each valley is dotted with villages. In this kind of place, in my opinion, if there's mourning, it's respected throughout the area. Slowly. You're driving on the edge of the ravine. Stop, Something is happening here. Hello. Welcome. Thank you so much. Have some tea. Thank you, we have to go. You don't speak Turkish very well. You can speak to me in Persian. Thank you. We must go. One day or another, we must all go. But take the time to drink some tea. That's nice, thanks. I've already seen her somewhere, this lady. I don't know where. But not this gentleman, I don't know him. Apart from here, is there another village further on? Of course. Everywhere in these mountains and these valleys, there are many villages. Tell me which one you are looking for, I'll guide you. We walk, we photograph landscapes. All is well at home? Of course, everything is fine. "This world is unfair He knew Noah as Soliman He gives children as he takes them. Everything is pain in this world. Everything is fine, though. It is we who cause harm. Where is the cemetery? Are you looking for treasure? Do we look like treasure hunters? You don't look like you'd frequent cemeteries. Where is this cemetery? You went past, down the slope. Make a U-turn. At the next crossing, turn left. The cemetery is a little further. Otherwise, behind the hill, there's another. This is the old cemetery. But the treasure flew away. Thank you. We'll turn around, then. Take care. Goodbye. Goodbye. Why didn't you ask him anything? We could have talked to him for hours, but wouldn't have got anything out of him. Something was happening at home, but it didn't smell of death. Madame... Why were you lying there? Hello. Welcome to my last home. This is where I shall end. God bless you. What is she saying? That this is her last home. I'm hurting myself. She has been digging. I took a lantern with me. This lamp, I put it there, to have light, for the tomb to be illuminated a few hours each night. Otherwise, snakes will come to make me pay for the harm I have done. If there is light, it makes them run away. I will be rid of it. Why be afraid of snakes? You've done nothing wrong. I didn't do any good either. What did I do well? God will know. I wish you a long life. I hope that all will be well. Take care. Goodbye. It's a stunt, all that. This girl doesn't care about us. No trace of her in the village. Here, it looks like nobody has been buried for years. It's driving me crazy. What's this circus since last night? You said well that the video had been made by a pro. You said that at the moment of the fall, there was a cut. Yes. I watched. Everything seems true. I didn't see a cut. I told you that if there was one, it would not be an amateur montage. Only a pro could have done it. And in this back of beyond, there isn't one. So, everything is true! Okay. Can you swear it? Swear what? I can't anymore. I want to be reassured, at least on your account. If you want to be reassured, take this key, I leave you the car. I'll try to find a place to take an oath. Mr. Panahi, I was joking. I've not said anything bad! Excuse me, please. I regret what I said. I beg your pardon. I said nothing so serious, anyway... I beg you, Mr. Panahi. Make an effort, for the sake of your daughter, Solmaz. Watch out. Push yourself, children. Hello. Don't bother her. Go ahead, get off, Mrs. Jafari. I don't speak Turkish. Welcome. Applaud in honor of Mrs. Jafari. Damn. - Don't bother him, kids. - Thank you. You are fine? Hello. It's okay? What do you want me to write? Wait, I will write. What's your name? Hold on... "Fereshteh, good luck." I'm sorry... Can you sign? "Good luck." Hello. Hello. Sir, here we have water and electricity cuts. Gas, don't talk about it. Sorry, but we have nothing to do with all that. We thought that you came to help us. I'm really sorry. Haven't we seen you in a series? You were preparing for your guest. I don't know what dish it was. We can ask them. Would you know a Marziyeh? Marziyeh... Do you know her? Yes, she's my sister. She is sick. No that's not her. She says that Marziyeh, is her sister and she's sick. She's not the one we're looking for. she's a girl... who was received at the conservatory. Okay, it's not us you came here for, but for a little crazy one. We thought you were going to solve our problems. Come on, let's go. Everyone goes home. We are left in trouble. What's that? Unbelievable. Marziyeh is not very popular in the village. Her little sister will lead you to her place. You know which Marziyeh it is? Let's go. Pass me the key. Hello. Come in, please. It's Marziyeh's here? Mom, where are you going? Out of here! You will not set foot here! Go away! - Don't make me feel ashamed. - Come on! Where have they come from? She won't study! Is there nothing better? Get out of here! Studies, and then what else? Welcome. Pass by. - She won't study! - You make me ashamed. Go away. I won't go! What are they doing here? Study for what? Dirty bitch! Leave me ! I won't let her go to school! She dishonours us! Ill mannered! Let's go. I beg you, come on. I'm sorry. Come in. Thank you Madam. It's very good here. Are you sure? Sit down, then. We don't want to disturb you. Thank you. What was he saying? Nothing. He insulted everyone. Was he was talking about? We didn't understand anything he said. He wasn't clear. It was incomprehensible. There is no sign of... Don't bother. You are welcome. I suspected you would come. Too bad it's happening now. We'll lose face in the village. - Why do you say that? - What can I say? It's been three days since Marziyeh left. We searched everywhere. We haven't found her. Before, when she was angry, she went to her aunt's house. She isn't there either. Her father went to Tehran, in case she is there for the conservatory. Her fiance's family doesn't know. I hope she'll come back soon. Otherwise, Mehdi will make a scandal. If the fiance's family learns of it, it will end very badly for my daughter. - It's her brother? - Yes, her little brother. Why don't you call her? We did. Her phone is off. - Ask her girlfriends. - She doesn't have a girlfriend. Villagers don't let their girls hang out with Marziyeh. They are afraid that they'll become scatterbrained. "We don't want any acrobats", they say. Acrobat... I'd forgotten that word. Roghieh. Are you going to see who's ringing? My daughter was the most talented, the most intelligent of all. Her only problem, she doesn't know how to keep quiet. She says whatever she thinks. It doesn't please everyone. As soon as she got it into her head to study, I knew it was going to end badly. I thought if we married her off, she'd get over it. But she laid down her conditions. We had to accept them. Her father said that the selection was so hard that she would never be taken. I took her away secretly pass the contest. Unfortunately she got it. I don't know what to do. Maedeh doesn't know where she is? How do you know Maedeh? For registration at the conservatory, you need a reference person, Marziyeh put Maedeh's name. - It's her cousin. - She lives here? Yes, very close. You are sitting badly. It's not serious. Can we go see Maedeh? No, stay there. I'll send Roghieh to get her. Go get Maedeh. We'll go in the car. We'll wait in the car. Thank you. When she's here she'll come to see us. Thanks a lot, Madam. It's very nice. - I'll bring you some tea. - No thanks. Don't put yourself to so much trouble. You should stay. Maedeh's arriving. We'll wait for her in the car. Don't talk to anyone. Of course. Thank you very much, goodbye. Don't worry. Thank you, goodbye. No need to accompany us. Goodbye. Three days... Do you think she's dead? I don't know. Mrs. Jafari, I can't believe my eyes! Go home, little one. Your mother will worry. Are you fine? What are you doing here? - Maedeh, tell me where she is. - Who is that? Listen, I'm not in the mood to joke. Will you stop your comedy. I've had enough ! I don't understand. - Where is Marziyeh? - She's not at home? Come see. You sent me a video on Telegram, Yes or no? I don't have a laptop. Mr. Panahi... give me your cell phone. Unlock it. Whose is this number? This is Marziyeh's number. What is happening? You worry me. I don't understand. Ms. Jafari... Mr Panahi, Has something happened? Mr. Panahi... No. It's nothing. When did you last see Marziyeh? It's been two or three days. She didn't tell you anything? What should she have told me? I dunno... About the courses, for example. She talks about it all the time, classes. Didn't she tell you when she was leaving? How could she, poor thing? She is desperate that someone prevents her. You know something, Mr. Panahi? She doesn't know anything, apparently. Mr. Panahi... - Is there a cave here? - Why? To know. Yes, there. You can see it going towards the mountain. Mr. Panahi... Sorry. Has something happened? Answer me, please. No, nothing happened. Only, don't tell anyone. Okay? Don't tell anyone. - Promise? - Yes. - Take care. - Thank you, goodbye. Mr. Panahi, this is it! There, the branch. But the rope? The corpse, the laptop and all the rest, where are they? I told you it was rigged. You expected everything to be still there? - Maybe they took her away. - Who is that? Her family. You said they would hide everything to save their honor. But they say they've had no news for three days! If they want to hide her, they wouldn't tell us the opposite. So they're playing with us? No, they playing their honor. Hello. Sit down. Thank you so much. Don't bother. How are you? - What would you like? - What can we have? Fresh eggs, they are very good. Just two teas, thank you. We are honored by your presence. Welcome. Sorry, I didn't recognize you on the road. I was told afterwards. I'm sorry. He welcomes us. He apologizes for not recognizing you You're welcome. The honking, just now, it was what? I thought you understood me. I understood... but what was it exactly? You'll allow me to explain? In fact, in our village, the only road, that you have seen, is bumpy and very narrow. Only one car passes at a time. We honk on the bend to know if the way is free. If it's free, we can go. Otherwise, the car on the other side honks to warn of its presence. We know it's there. If you don't honk back, it means that the other can pass. If he's in a hurry, he honks twice. It's an emergency signal. What are we doing, in this case? We wait. We wait for the other to pass. If you are in a hurry too, you honk continuously. To say that you have a real urgency, like a sick passenger. There, he lets you go. We decided this rule between us. You invent your own rules. Of course, sir. Without a rule, nothing stands up. Just a little common sense. For example, in this village, we have beautiful gardens, beautiful orchards, generous soil. But if one day someone gets sick, will the garden, the orchard, the soil heal him? Of course not. It's doctors we need. To treat us when you are sick. In this village, there are more parables than inhabitants. Tomorrow, if they are sick, who will heal them? The parables or apprentice acrobats? Who will be able to treat them? This girl doesn't want to hear reason. She's just doing it. A real crazy one. You came here to do what? She doesn't want to hear anything... And if anyone wants to be an acrobat, what is one supposed to do? There, it doesn't go at all. We have a saying in the village: a corpse, if you let it go, shits itself. You know the harm we do ourselves for our animals? Our lives depend on them. We must do everything not to lose them. Without them, we cannot live. This little girl should understand that if the life of an acrobat was enviable, that Mrs. Shahrzad, who had her hour of glory, would not end up living alone, like a wretch, in a lost hole. Who is Shahrzad? She is a lady who, before the Revolution, danced and sang in the movies. Mr. Panahi! Not here, here! Hurry up. Do you realize in what a state you've put me? Since yesterday, I've moved heaven and earth to try to find you, dirty kid. - And you, you play hide and seek? - Listen to me ! - Are you not ashamed? - Excuse me. What must I forgive? Are you kidding me? Listen, Behnaz! Don't call me by my first name! Shut your mouth ! You get on my nerves! - I was manipulated by a kid! - Allow me... I won't allow you! What more do you want? Stop hitting her. Move over. Shut up, you! You didn't hear from her? You bitch, why are you lying? Why are you lying to me? Why would I lie to you? Why would I lie to you? Only you could save me! Otherwise, I wouldn't have done that. You don't want to understand? You don't want to understand? Please, Mrs. Jafari. I beg you, understand me. You're welcome. I had no choice. You were my only recourse to go to the conservatory. Little scatterbrain. You too treat me like I'm crazy! You speak like the others! I beg you, understand me. There is only you who can help me. I tried everything, everything! I only had this way. I'm indebted to you, besides? What do you want from me? Couldn't you have just asked me? If I'd asked you, if I'd told the truth, would you have come? You really would have come? Please, Mrs. Jafari. I beg you. I'll kneel if necessary. Don't go! This time, my brother will kill me. Because I disappeared for three days. He will set fire to Shahrzad's house. If he learns that I was at home, he will destroy everything. I beg you. And you, don't leave! Why don't they want to understand? - Hello, how are you? - Thank you. You have a cell-phone? There's a signal? Wait, I'll see. No, no signal. What's going on? Nothing. We took the bull and he fell. What are you going to do? What am I going to do? I can't do anything at all. My colleague went to see at the top of the hill if there's a signal. If there is, he will try to call a vet. If there are none, he will go to the village to call from a landline. This poor beast will die by then. What else can I do? Tell me. I can help you push it to the side, so one can pass. You don't realize! He's bloated, look at his belly. If you touch him, he'll die. We won't stay here waiting. You can finish it. Don't speak of misfortune! I honked, though. You could have shown yourself so I wouldn't have come. I heard, but I thought it was my colleague with the vet. A veterinarian in the village? What an idea ! I think you are interested in reducing your loss. Even human beings, we shorten their suffering. Do it for him. It's a sin. Besides, I only have a small knife. I can't do that, he would suffer. He is already suffering. Yes, but it's different. He is suffering, but it's neither me nor you who will have to answer. It's God who wanted it. Whereas if I attack him with a knife, we will both be responsible. It's not just any bull. This is the gold standard stud. - What? - It's a stud. - You see what I mean? - No. Excuse me, but does the lady understand Turkish? No, she doesn't understand. I'll explain it to you. He's a stud bull. It's not just any bull, he's very special. He's used for reproduction. You see it slumped in front of your car. But understand, nowhere in Azerbaijan nor even in all of Iran, will you find another like this. He's a breed apart, a special strain, a unique beast. I saw it with my own eyes. In one night, he impregnated ten cows. I get 300,000 tomans by coupling. Tomorrow there is a big party here. They will arrive from all over the region, with trucks full of heifers. I'll let you imagine the atmosphere. I can already see the trucks lined up in front of him to wait. The worst is the cows in the village. As soon as they smell him, they start to moan. If you sleep there, you'll see what I'm talking about. When they are all there, it's like a symphony orchestra. A phenomenon. And he had to take a fall... Tomorrow, when the heifers arrive, what am I going to tell them? If something happened to him, I couldn't replace him. - You know why? - Why? His testicles work miracles. Kebab one for an old man of 80, you'll make him a beast. We'll turn around, Mr. Panahi. We have to go, goodbye. I'll leave you my card. You never know. If you need a lift, we make express kebab deliveries. Thank you. Goodbye. Listen, it's you who see, but I think you were very hard with her. People here are not used to that. They get upset quickly and forget even faster. Since we're going back there, try to make amends. But it's up to you. Hello. - Okay? - It's okay. I was told that Shahrzad lived here. A little further, left. Thank you. Hello. Thank you for coming back. Please, Mr. Panahi. Wait, please. One minute. I'm sorry, Mr. Panahi. There's something going on, I'll see. - What? - I'll tell you. Wait for me there. Do you need anything? You did well not to come, it's tiny. She would have been embarrassed. What happened? Nothing. She wants the whole world. Especially to those with whom she worked. She says they gave her much trouble. I told her you weren't making movies at that time. She answered me: "All The same! There's not one to catch the other." She must blame us not to have supported her. But she was not alone. All the actors of the time ended up the same. She has nothing at home. Just her paintings and posters of her films. It's like that. I suggested to Marziyeh bring her back before leaving. But she prefers to wait for the return of her father from Tehran tomorrow morning. He looks less limited than the brother. But that's how you prefer it. We have a choice? Not really. But what are you going to do? Nothing. I am well. I'll stay here. But no. If the villagers learn it, they won't leave you outside. I want to stay here. I'm going to sleep in the car. I'm tired. I'm more secure here than elsewhere. I'll leave you that. They are from here, it's delicious. There's tea, I'll bring you some. She also left me a CD of her poems. She read them? Yes, she recorded them in Kerman. She just received them and offered me one. I leave it for you. Thank you so much. Do you need anything? Good evening. I had reached the height of uncertainty Wishing to know the names The hand of the supervisor made the hammer dance in the air and broke the breath of immaculate dawn Against the red metal tip hanging on the school pine Sounds, rings, rings Silence tortured innocence The first prayer was for me an obvious curse Standing Sitting I did not say: present. In this case, you are absent. Mr. Panahi... Sorry, did I wake you? No, I was drowsy. You want us to walk a little, to the village? I can make a phone call. I'll call the assistant. They have been worried since yesterday. I really don't have the courage. But if you want, I'll come. No. Rest. I'll come back soon. Have fun. Hello? Good evening, Mr. Ahmadi. I'm so sorry. I know well. I understand you. It was really a situation... I dunno... Even if I had come, I would have been good for nothing. I talked to her. Yes. I understand. You are quite right. But you can tell me tomorrow. We can film at night, from six o'clock. - Book me. I'll be in Tehran. - Can I interrupt you? Thank you. I'll explain when we see each other. Not at all. It's not relevant. No problem at all. I'll explain. Thank you for your understanding. Thank you so much. Good night. Goodbye. Since you are here, tell us the end of the series. As usual, it will end with mourning! There is one who will die. Thank you very much, sir. Excuse me. - How much do I owe you? - It'll be fine. No, please. I had a tea, I could do what I wanted... You're welcome. I'm embarrassed. It's really nothing. It is an honor to receive you. Thank you so much. Goodbye. Monsieur is not here anymore? Yes, but he's tired. He's sleeping in the car. I wanted to tell him something. Tell me, I'll give it to him. I don't dare tell you. Yes, I'm like your daughter. Not here, like that, at the cafe. We can go to my house for a few minutes? Do you remember my house? - The one with the yard? - That's it. - But I'll have to go home early. - Okay. I have this little souvenir for you and sir. It comes from the circumcision party. Thank you, it was for your grandson? No, finally! It's my son, not my grandson. Bravo, a boy at your age? I wish you'd been there. You should have seen it with your own eyes. We would not have thought he was cut. He didn't shed a single tear. When my eldest son was circumcised, I took the skin and I went to Tehran. I wanted to bury it near a palace. So that one day, my son would work there, if only as a guardian, and that he can help me. The guards came to arrest me. They beat me to death. They hit me every day. Then they released me. I went to the cinema. There, I saw the movie. Then, I got up and I went home. Then God gave me four girls. Congratulations. Even my second wife could not have a boy. She did not have a boy. 12 years ago, God gave me a second son. Good evening, madam. Sorry to disturb you. Thank you so much. Thank you. How much does meat cost in Tehran? I don't buy meat. I'm a vegetarian. So, you said? I'm waiting for my wife to leave. And how is it in Tehran? It's hot and polluted. Here it is cool. Here. Thank you very much, it wasn't necessary. Thank you. Don't bother. That's fine, thank you. I was wondering... this story that you told me about your son, what influence can it have on his future, his work? Because at home, you don't circumcise boys? What do they do with the skin? They throw it away, I suppose. But it's sacred. It's not surprising misfortunes happen to you. The fate of the child depends on it. You have to give it to your godfather, to hide it in a chosen place. If he does it in the yard of a prison, the child will become a delinquent. In the yard of a university, he will be a doctor or engineer. - It's funny. - That's not funny. I'm not laughing. If we want him to be a doctor, just bury this thing in the right place, right? Of course not! He must study! But thanks to that, God encourages him to work seriously to enter the university. These are our customs. You know Za?l? Who is that? Shir Mammad. Everyone knows him, but not you? What is his full name? Vossoughi. Behrouz Vossoughi. Behrouz Vossoughi? Yes, look. Here. That's a man, a real man. He is manly. He's courageous. We see in his eyes that he is a man. It's certain. - He is alive? - Yes. All the better. I thank God. As long as he is alive, the fate of Ayoub is in his hands. I have kept this for 38 years to be able to assure him a future, thanks to God. You could... give him that? What's this? Don't take it badly. It must not be rejected. I kept it in the salt, wrapped in cotton and put in this fabric. This is the skin of my son. What do I do? Be nice, give it to sir for him to give it to the manly man. He will not be able to. Mr. Vossoughi is abroad. Do us a favor. When sir goes abroad, let him take it with him. It's that sir... cannot go abroad. And Mr. Vossoughi cannot come here. Why? Because... In this case, take it, give it to sir and give it to your boss. Let him tell him the story of my Ayoub. Maybe God will help us. Even the problem of sir and the manly man can be solved by this piece of skin. - Okay. - It has virtues, I tell you. Good night. Thank you. Please? I wanted to tell you something else. I saw in the series that you were single. We have room here. Stay, it's nice. Thank you. Give at least this letter to sir. If he has a problem, it will help him. What is it? The story of Ayoub's life. - Thank you. - Goodbye. Good evening, madam. What are you doing here? - I learned you were back. - I was going to your house. - News from my daughter? - She's fine, rest assured. Did you see her with your own eyes? Thank you. Let me kiss your hand. You helped her a lot. It's your daughter who made me come here. Good evening. You're coming home? Thanks again. Don't stay in the dark. Good night. Thank you. Sleep easy. Your daughter is fine, She is at Shahrzad's house. What is happening? Her father's arriving. If her brother learns that she is there, he will start a fire. He will set fire to Shahrzad's house? Why? We are in a village. People are talking. We are dishonored. I thought she was in Kerman. What is she doing here? She arrived two years ago. At first, we bothered him a lot. When the mayor knew that she had played in movies, that she danced there, he decided to chase her away. He sent people for the... to go throw her things outside. It didn't bother her. She painted all day long. She said being outside didn't bother her. People finished by leaving her alone. The mayor has forbidden us to go to her place and she didn't go to anyone's house. But we only talked about her. My mother keeps telling me, "You want to be an acrobat like Shahrzad?" You're preparing a shot for a new victim? You could call? Yes, I must be in Tehran, tomorrow at six. - We'll be there. - I hope. An old man in the village gave that for you. - What's this? - A letter. The rest, I'll explain it later. I'm going, I'm really hungry. I saw Marziyeh's mom. Good night. Can you open it later? What? Open it later. Do you know what's inside? They are all in cahoots. And your fiance? He disappeared in the traffic? He's been a deserter for 5 years. From time to time, he cracks and he returns to the village. Some time later and he decides to leave. Everytime, he promises not to desert, but he does it only in his head. He could land there. How would you do it? Him, I can convince him. For his family, I don't know. There's no logic, no rules here. Except for the road. They invented one, but it changes every day. One day, I took a shovel and a pickaxe to widen one end of the road, so cars can pass each other. I was pulled off the shovel. "It's not for women. These tools represent the farmer's honor." You can turn off? Sorry. Take this. Good evening. What good wind brings you? Are you fine? Thank you so much. You okay? We're going home? The mayor asked that we take you to rest. Thank you so much. We'll leave at dawn. That's why I stayed there. Otherwise, I'll be here, thank you. Do you miss anything? No, I have everything. Otherwise, I would have bothered you... Clothing, a blanket... That's kind, nothing, thank you. Thank you so much. Greet everyone for me. We won't bother you anymore. Thank you very much, good evening. Good evening, take care. They don't listen to us, the townspeople. If we have a hailstorm, we'll see. Speak no misfortune. We have more to lose than him. We would lose all our crops. Nevertheless, it would teach her a lesson. Hello. Did you sleep well? You want to wash your face to wake up? Hello. At dawn, she took her painting material and left. You have received a gift. She doesn't mind me that much. No, she lives her life. And so what is it? I became a godfather. I'll leave it there. Let's go? Mr. Panahi... Women know better in these situations. Who's there? Hello. Who's here? It's us. I bring you back Marziyeh. - Come in. - Thank you. Promise me there'll be no problem. Come in. Get out of here. Where do you want me to go? Open the door. I'll continue a little walk. Mrs. Jafari! Mrs. Jafari, wait for me! translation: Masoumeh Lahiji
