And in 2016, when America experienced multiple domestic terrorist attacks, my good friend and New York firefighter, Tim Brown, came to me with a movie concept. Based around the idea, what would happen if simultaneous terrorist attacks occurred all across America, all on one day. What would that look like? I didn't even like thinking about the possibility of that and the bigger question that came to my mind was, could we prevent it? Like Jason said, I sifted through the rubble of the Oklahoma City bombing. I was under the towers when they came down in New York, killing 93 of my friends. I've seen terrorism up close and personal. So I thought what if we banded together, not just to raise awareness of terrorism in America, but to actually help Americans understand how to prevent it, how to prevent this scourge from visiting us, this evil of... from doing what it did to me. And I didn't have to think twice about being involved in this project. To raise awareness for all Americans, to understand that this a very real threat. And how they can prevent it. And Tim went about recruiting 9/11 survivors to be involved in this film. And I... I went about looking for fellow veterans and families of the fallen from all wars, so that we could show you how we can prevent a possible real story from ever happening. I hope when you watch this you will spread the word to all your friends and fellow Americans about this threat, but more than anything, I hope you'll walk away from this being steadfast and vigilant. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MAN YELLING] - MAN: Clear. - [MAN YELLING] MAN 1: We're walking out in the hallway! MAN 1: We're walking out in the hallway! MAN 2: Move up. Regroup. [GUNSHOT] MAN 1: Hey, jackpot, jackpot, we got jackpot. - [MAN CHEERING] - We got it. - MAN 2: Right. - MAN 1: Target secure! - [SHOTS FIRING] - Aw, crap. And that's. Fatal mistake. Failure to properly clear the target before calling target secure. Jot down and let's head back to the classroom. Nobody dies like you do, Kamal. You guys always pick on the brown people. All right guys... training's been going good, really good. Maybe even too good for you guys to let your guard down like that. Your time on target has been great, your room entries have been flawless. Right up until that last room. We set this scenario up on purpose and you guys fell for it. You got sucked in to the primary target in the center of the room and you missed the threat in the corner. That fatal mistake cost you the lives of two officers... and your hostages. Your primary objective in this training exercise was the hostages. And in your excitement to kill me, you neglected to get them to safety. Your enemy is not as well trained as you are. But do not ever underestimate them. Their strength is in the passion to an evil that they believe is not evil but honorable. You have to understand that. And even though your training is far superior than theirs... their heart and their passion is much stronger. All right guys, we train this way for a reason. The more we sweat and bleed in training scenarios like this one, the less we bleed and die in real world missions. Erin. All right guys, let's head to the range. Hi, where do we check our boat in? That's actually not necessary. Welcome to the island. - Thank you. - Welcome. Welcome. - Morning. - MAN: Okay. [MUSIC PLAYING] - Good morning. - Morning. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] [KEYPAD TAPPING] What are you listening to? Not sure, probably nothing. A few months ago, Anonymous attacked ISIS. A hacker friend of mine sent this to me, they think it's from a known ISIS leader. Sounds like Baghdad Airport in the background. Why do you think it's Baghdad Airport? I don't, Anonymous does. [KEYBOARD CLICKS] It's an airport, but not Baghdad Airport. More western modern airport... a busier airport. Maybe the Netherlands... Amsterdam or Berlin. Play it again. Listen. It goes from inside to outside, boom... - [MAN CHUCKLING] - ...he's on the street. - Busy street with moving cars... - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] ...not parked cars like they're waiting for arrivals. You barely hear him over the traffic. Sound of the jet in the background taking off. You know there's only a few airports in the world that are in the middle of the city like that. Keep working on it. Wait. There's a diesel engine in the background. Can you isolate that and run it? Who else knows about this? No one, this is just a favor. My paper? SOUP: I'm gonna hang on to this. [KEYBOARD TAPPING] Gene says you got British and Italian blood in you. - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - Don't listen to that nitwit, he don't know what he's talking about. Shh, can you turn that up, please. NEWSCASTER: Detention center after being picked up on suspicion at Tampa International Airport for wanting to join the terrorist group known as ISIS. A spokesman from the police say that two young females were acting suspicious when trying to pay cash for one-way tickets to Lebanon. During police questioning it was revealed that they were attempting to join the terrorist group, ISIS. We have, live on the scene, one of the fathers of the young girls. Sir, how do you feel about this? My daughter didn't want to be a terrorist. Give me a break. She's a naive kid who got caught up in some stupid internet prank. Did you hear the father? That happened here to his kids and the father thinks it was a dumb internet prank? Internet prank? - That's propaganda, baloney. - Are you trying to tell me... that two teenage girls... can get 3,000 dollars to buy last minute tickets on a flight to Lebanon to join some terrorist group? There's way too much organization to this, there's a lot more to it than what appears on the surface. What if they got boots on the ground? KEN: Think they're here already? They're definitely here already. - That's it. - Where you going? - I'm out of here. - Where you going, sit down. I'm going on a recon mission. This has really been an amazing experience, - Lieutenant Campbell. - Hey, just call me Soup. Lieutenant, that's a whole another life. So tell me about your department. We have about 30 members of the Pittsburgh SWAT. I'm very proud of my team. We mostly handle crisis situations, hostages, gun related crimes. Well, I tell you we really appreciate you guys bringing your team down here to train with us. - Heathrow. - What? Heathrow Airport, that's where the phone call was made. The ISIS call. I pulled all the engine noises out, including the diesel motor. Then, I could faintly in the background hear a lady giving directions, "The second tube stop," she said. It's faint but 100 percent accurate. And the diesel motor you heard, matches engine types in the UK. Can you email me that file? Encrypted. You got it. Erin... I think it's about time we give old Tex a call. Tex? Yeah, uh, he's a bull rider turned security contractor. We worked with him in Iraq. ERIN: Gosh. You do a lot of contractor training here? Yeah. Lot of military, lot of law enforcement units, like yourself. Then I'm grateful the city of Pittsburgh sent us here. - Now what? - Would you shut up? This is a waste of time. Here they come, here they come. MICK: Ah, you're a pain in the neck. Oh, why don't you shut up? - I mean... - You just talk - too much. - You never stop. You just go on and on and on. Is that the church you go to? Yeah, but it's been a long time. - I can tell that. - What can you tell? You're looking at a devout Catholic over here, I'll be Canaanite someday. Devout Catholic? When was the last time you went to confession, let alone church. - Sixty-five years ago... - Oh please, the same old thing - with you. - Let me answer, - let me tell you. - Stop it. Before I punch you in the mouth, dang it. ERIN: Two pairs, three and seven. - SOUP: Gotta be kidding me. - ERIN: Ah. SOUP: I can't believe you bet with that amount again. [ERIN CHUCKLES] You always win, beginner's luck. ERIN: Yes, uh, how long you gonna keep saying - it's beginner's luck, Soup? - [PHONE RINGING] Soup here. - TEX: Hey. - Hey, can't complain, brother. Making it to the big time. Just completed our live fire indoor kill house, only one on the east coast. Yeah man, you got to get up here. You need to see it, it's been too long. Hey listen, a friend of mine sent us a recording of, what we believe is an intercepted ISIS phone call. What's odd about it is they talk about despite all they've accomplished... we're still looking for The Perfect Day. The call originated from Heathrow. Three days ago, about 3:30 eastern standard time. What's The Perfect Day? In 1857, the Hindus and Muslims in an attempt to overthrow the British government in India, organized small simultaneous attacks against the government. Thousands of small attacks, uh. Nanny killed the baby of whom they were hired to look after... fires burned homes and shops of British citizens, leaders were assassinated... all on one day, within several hours of each other. They crippled the country. It was called... The Perfect Day. - Tex, you still there? - TEX: I'm here. Hey man, if I send you that recording, - can you run it for us? - TEX: Yup. All right, thanks brother. Hey, keep me in the loop. MAN: Thank you so much. - [MUSIC PLAYING] - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] I thought Denver would be colder this time of year. Today is perfect, The perfect day. So I ran that registration by the FBI. It came up as, Luis Marcel a software developer from Lakeshore, Ontario. This guy comes here 'bout every other week. Stays for about three days then leaves. I never see him anywhere on the island, and he doesn't check his boat in, so I can't search for him in any database. He never checks his boat in? Here, it is not required to check your boat in. And we don't have the US Customs office on the island to monitor it. So you can... Yes, you can come from Canada to the US... and never be stopped, never show your passport, never see a customs agent, nothing. SOUP: You remember that guy we met in Kosovo? Jackson Trembley. He was with Canadian Intel, you should call him. I will. Hey, thanks. I'll stay in touch. SOUP: Huh, look what the cat drug in. - How you doing, brother? - It's good to see you, slacker. THOMAS: Good to see you. And when politics are involved, no one wins. - Ain't that the truth? - THOMAS: Yeah. Thomas, this is Erin. SOUP: Erin's my lead sniper instructor. She's also the range safety officer for today's training. Erin, this is Thomas Dearing. Thomas is the head of the Dallas tactical SWAT team. We also go way back. Thomas and I went through SEAL training together and I carried him through sniper school. ERIN: Shooter ready on the right? Ready. ERIN: Shooter ready on the left? SOUP: Ready. ERIN: Stand by! Three, two, one! [GUNSHOTS FIRING] The kitchen and shelter don't open 'til five. Oh, but I brought some food I wanted to donate. Oh. Okay. I brought chicken, mashed potatoes - and some green beans. - Oh, that's nice. Um, I'm sorry, what was your name? - John. - John, I'm Allie. That's a beautiful name. - Thanks. - So... would you mind if I hang around during dinner? Maybe I can help. Yeah, I think that'd be nice. In here. [KEYBOARD CLICKING] [PHONE RINGING] CARLENE: Hello? Is anybody there? Carlene, it's Soup. I've got something I've got to show you. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] JOHN: Seat taken? Are you looking for a job? Um, my hotel... the internet is down and they... they said that I could use this facility, is that okay? Yes, I'm sure it is. What kind of work do you do? Sales, um, I... I work, I travel. Do you like the job you have now? I'm always looking. My name is John. Are you busy tomorrow? I have several job openings. No. I'm Dean. So how about I pick you up tomorrow morning at the corner? I'm sure your hotel is close by, and I... don't really know my way around the city, so. On the corner, out front? DEAN: Yes, I can, uh, I could check out and walk to the corner say... 7:00 a.m.? Yes. CARLENE: Paul. Paul. Why did this report get to the director's office before mine? Um, because he needed to know about it. Maybe at the CIA, you don't have protocol. But here at the CTC, we have protocol. You report to me and I report to the director. You answer to me, Carlene. You may be one of the best intelligence analysts in Washington... and we're glad to have you... but your speculations are without substance. You have chatter about a trigger man recruiting from who knows where and a high ranking terrorist making reference to The Perfect Day. This is called, the Counterterrorism Center - for a reason, Paul. - It's not credible. Listen to me, you have no viable evidence of anything on large scale - to suggest... - It's not large scale. That's the point. These are small attacks, Paul. Small, but very real attacks. You know the story of the girl who cried wolf? Is that a threat, Paul? No. Here's your protocol... don't ever touch me again. Echofar Bank has transferred over six million dollars to multiple banks in Quebec over the past several months. US Embassies are on high alert all across the globe. Record number of Americans are joining terrorist groups. ERIN: Soup. Soup! The money, I know it's being laundered here. Soup, what is going on? SOUP: They're setting it up. They're setting up for The Perfect Day. THOMAS: Unas Alibas. Known terrorist. SOUP: We know he left Iraq to join ISIS in Syria. We lost track of him shortly after that and don't know where he went. All these guys... former Al-Qaeda, new allegiance to ISIS. The problem is... nobody knows where they are. - THOMAS: Are they here? - You should hope and pray not. Something's going on here guys... - I know it. - Let's get to work. What can we do? Research. Can you help us investigate these leads? Yeah, yeah, we can do that. Thomas, this isn't any part of the Black Bear Training Program. If you'd rather, we have other instructors who can continue your team's training. Are you kidding me? This is for real. All right, then. Let's do this. Hey, Erik! You were let go, weren't you? How did you know that? You gave them ten years of your life... it was where you made a living for you... your wife, Sandra, and your son, Connor. All was great, wasn't it, Dean? It was. They did me wrong. They did. And you know what... they've been doing the same thing to countless other people just like you. I lost my wife. We lost our house, our car. We lost everything. I know. I know all about it and... I don't think it's right. No, it's not. Mr. Cochran, I represent a large international network that is in the business of... reversing injustice. Providing fairness to those wronged. How often do you wish you could get back what you lost? Every day. Every... day. Your son, Connor? I haven't seen him for three months. I have nothing. I lost so much. I know. But today, we can turn that all around. How? Revenge. Justifiable revenge. Yeah... I want them to pay. Every last one of 'em. Mr. Cochran we want to hire you for a job. Name it. Provide a revenge... to those in that building that hurt you... and are hurting so many other people. What do you want me to do? All right, listen up! Recently, we received reporting that a top ISIS leader placed a phone call that originated out of Heathrow Airport. That said, we're preparing for The Perfect Day. Hundreds of small attacks... terrorist attacks originating... right here in the United States. Triggered by one event and one person. Problem is we don't know where, when, or how. That's what we need to find out. Dallas, I want you guys to focus west of the Mississippi. Pittsburgh, you guys got the east coast. We need data. Not political hype or racial vilification. Work within your networks, people that you know. And beyond. We need to know the pulse of the law enforcement community out there. FBI, homeland security. Do we need to call anybody at the Bureau? Or the CIA? Shouldn't we take this higher. We're way ahead of you. Guys, we don't want anyone to know that we're investigating this. Okay, any word of this could speed up plans to bring about The Perfect Day. And don't just target mosques and Muslims. This is America's biggest misconception. An Islamic extremist is different than a Muslim. Okay, Dallas, classroom 302 is open. Pittsburgh, I believe 204 is available. We're gonna keep the conference room as headquarters. I want everybody back here at the end of the day with your reports. Seventeen hundred hours. Okay. - ERIN: Okay, got it right here. - SOUP: That one. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] I appreciate what you said about not targeting all Muslims. You Americans love your stereotypes. You know him? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] And listen just take those stairs over there, they are going to love you and you're going to have a wonderful time. - Nice to meet you. - WOMAN: Thank you so much. Hi there, gentlemen, uh... Gene, Gene Whit. Oh my goodness, I haven't seen you in forever. It's been a while. What on earth brings you back here after all this time? Well, I figured old Mick here could use a bit of church. Oh, hi Mick, it's nice to meet you. Uh, we're looking to volunteer for the youth group. That is fantastic. - Exact same thing... - GENE: Can you direct us... Okay, so you're gonna wanna take the elevator to the second floor, not the third floor, 'cause the third floor is the nursery. Got it, thank you. But just take it to the second floor... We're good, thank you so much. And when you get off just hang a right. - You'll see it. Hi, how are you? - Fine, - good morning, how are you? - Good morning, it's good to see you here. What can I do for you... ♪ Thousand stories of what They think you're like ♪ ♪ And I hope to tell The tender whisper ♪ MICK: You think she's here? GENE: I don't know Mickey, we'll find out. ♪ And tell me that your reason ♪ ♪ To love wherever ♪ - Morning guys. - Hey pastor. - Hey. - Hey, uh, this is the youth department. Might you be looking for the sanctuary? You calling me old? We're just visiting. Hey Andy, will you come pray for us? Uh, excuse me, I'll be right back. Can we sit here? What's your name, kid? Gabby. You in a war or something? I was. - Where? - Korea. My dad was a soldier. There's nothing more noble than to fight for a cause. Maybe we'll see you later to... tonight. SOUP: Lark, what's up man? Last night, you know the two guys that travel with Luis Marcel? SOUP: Yeah. Apparently, their job is to take him to and from the island twice a month. Get this, he doesn't stay on the island. SOUP: What do you mean? LARK: As soon as he gets here, he checks in and heads straight to his hotel, seemingly spends hours there, only he doesn't. They cover for him. They even order room service to make it... to keep up the facade. Instead, he takes the public ferry to Ohio and returns a few days later. Have you called our friend at Canadian Intel yet? LARK: No. Hang on, buddy. [PHONE RINGING] Is Mr. Marcel still on the island? LARK: That's a negative. Can you monitor the ferry boats? - LARK: Yes, sir. - JACKSON: Hello. Jackson. Lieutenant Campbell, how are you friend? Aw man, we're doing great. Hey, listen, we got something we're working on here and... You have my full support, Soup, you know that. But can you tell me who else is on the call? Yeah, absolutely. You got Roy Williams, Roy is the owner of Black Bear. On the speaker you got retired lieutenant, Larkin Drake. Lieutenant Drake was the... Guy who saved my butt in Kosovo. Lark, how you doing? You still go by Lark. LARK: I do. Do you know the software developer named Luis Marcel from Quebec? Gentlemen, I'm gonna need a bit more. This guy has been making multiple trips under the radar into the US. Let me guess, by boat? - Lake Erie. - LARK: Yes, sir. We don't have a lot of intel to go on, but... something's going on here. This may not be it. Marcel is a carrier, the whole software developer is a front. He was arrested on money laundering charges a few years back. We couldn't make it stick. A carrier? We know he's getting money. His accounts increase with deposits and he pulls the cash and he disappears on his boat. We figured it was a... a... a business or maybe even a real, bad gambling problem, but with recent events here in Canada we... well maybe we should be taking a closer look. - Can you? - JACKSON: Yeah, I will. Is there anything else you can tell me? - No, not yet. - Okay, I got it. Let me see if uh, if we can track the money. Give me a day or so. Okay, thanks brother. Thanks, Lark. Roy, you know we've always appreciated your financial assistance. Building this amazing facility. Your patriotism to our great country. How much are you gonna need this time? - I don't know yet. - Let me know. Will do. MICK: Hey Gabby. Gabby? Are you smoking? No, I'm smoking. - Oh, hey guys. - GENE: Hi. You know... you know, we have handicapped parking. Do I look handicapped to you? Uh. Sorry we're getting here a bit late. Oh you guys aren't late, no worries, - the movie's about to start. - Let's go on in. Great, great, we'll be right behind you. I'm not gonna get you in trouble. What military were you in? I was in the army rangers second battalion. What was it like? What was it like? Oh, do you want a story? All right. One time we came to this village, outside the peninsula. The bad guys basically, killed and burnt the whole village down. But they knew we would stop to help. They booby trapped everything. There was a woman laying on the ground bleeding real bad. My friend O'Brian went to... went to her, boom, the mine went off. I went to pick him up, he was in pain, bad pain. He begged me not to move him. Uh, I looked in his eyes and they were eyes of a man that knew he was going to die. - Did he? - MICK: Yeah, he died in my arms. I guess that's the price you pay in war. It's the price I would pay over again to defend what is right. And... and the cost of freedom is very high. And if we don't do it, thousands, even millions, can die. This... what do you say, do you want to go to that movie? Give me your hand. There's a memorial I'd like to show you. To tell you about. Walked a steel down from New York from 9/11. MICK: Hey, kid! GABBY: Hey guys. - Hi, Gabby, how are you? - GABBY: Good. MICK: I'd like to show you something. What do you know about 9/11, what happened that day? Not much, actually. I just learned about it in school a little bit. GENE: Yeah. Did they tell you anything about why, what happened, what caused it? No? Uh, kind of interesting um, my grandson had the same reaction when I asked him that same situation, um. You know about the two towers that were hit? But did you know that there were four planes? - GABBY: Mm-hmm. - Yeah, tower one, tower two. And then, the Pentagon was struck, and then another plane went down in a town called Shanksville. And... that was where the term came, it's time to roll. Do you recall hearing that statement? No? Well... this is a dedication, a tribute, to honor those more than 3,000 people that were killed that day. Civilians, workers, first responders, uh and subsequently since then, um, almost 7,000... military men and women have been killed, in what is known as the War on Terrorism since September 11th. I think I want to join the military. I want to be a hero too. Why would you want to join the US military? Because the military offers a tremendous amount of opportunities for education. Last week you were joining ISIS, this week you joining the US military? That... that was an internet prank. A prank? That's no prank young lady. I know it... - it was... - It what, come on. It was just a game. A game? Bloody Warfare. It's a game my friends and I used to play. A couple months ago... this player came on. And he just asked us during the game... if we wanted to play in real life. It's an online game so you play with other people. Go on. He just asked us during the game if we wanted to play in real life... to become part of an army in real life. He said if we flew to Syria... we could join the army to help rescue women and children. We would fight against the bad people there. He said we would do good. The player said he needed us. Gabby, who was this man? - I... I can't. - Can't what? I can't say anything else. When we couldn't get overseas... he asked us if... if... if we... he sent us money. He wanted us to make bombs to take to school but... that's when I said no, I got out. He said he would kill us. Nobody's gonna hurt you, doll face, nobody. Gabby, who was this man? I don't know, he just messaged us through the game, but I don't play anymore, I swear. Gabby, let's go for a walk. What? She's talking about bombing a school. What is she, crazy? We need to call the FBI and the police. Hold on, this is serious, we got to think about this, this is bigger than Gabby. [PHONE RINGING] Hey, Mickey. Yeah, hello, doll face, how are ya? - I'm good. - You know, I never asked you, but I have an idea you work for the government. What's going on? Did you get everything loaded okay? One hundred 25-pound bags of ammonium nitrate fertilizer. That will be 756 dollars. THOMAS: I've got friends telling me extremists are infiltrating the armed forces. The government's never gonna fall to political correctness. Seasoned guys are never gonna allow what happened at Fort Hood to happen again. What else? You're right about one thing, Soup. [SIGHS] Um... Usually between Interpol, CIA, NSA, FBI, we get about 200 to 300 hits on terrorism - or extremist chatter a day. - What kind of hits? An email, intercepted phone call, um, maybe even an encrypted recording. In the past few weeks, that number has risen over a 1,000. Before 9/11, chatter concerning an attack was all over the place. Thousands of pieces of information. Everyone knew something was gonna happen. That was the problem, everyone knew something, but nobody worked collectively to put it all together. My brother is with the FBI in South Carolina. I called him just to check on what he's been hearing. He began to tell me about a group called the Underground Foocruft. I've heard of 'em. WOMAN: They've been around for some 30 odd years. Small communities, mostly in rural places, um, most Muslim. They live together, they have their own sets of laws. Years ago, they were connected with acts of violence, assassinations, stockpiling weapons. - How many are there? - Twenty... maybe 30, scattered across the United States. My brother said if there's an infrastructure for terrorism in the United States, this group already has it. [PHONE RINGING] That's a map of where they're located. Brian. In every tactical operation, there's a start point. How do they communicate with each individual player to say, "Hey... attack, it's time". There has to be a trigger. We find the trigger, we stop the attack. How do we find a trigger that no one wants us to find? They would never trust a strategy to just messages alone... it could get distorted. It's an event. It's an event that they control. And if we're not careful with our investigation, we could speed it up. RYAN: Okay guys, listen up. That was a buddy of mine, police officer. He said a concerned citizen called today to report a guy buying 2,500 pounds of fertilizer. - Ammonia nitrate? - Yes. They have a person and vehicle description, but haven't been able to track him down. Hey guys, let's take a break for dinner and meet back here in... uh, say, an hour? Okay, thanks. Thomas, hang on a minute. What's up, Soup? Brother, you guys are here for training. No worries, we're good. Terrorist camps, ammonium nitrate, questionable northern border security. What I'm about to ask you... you got to be straight up with me. We need guys monitoring this Underground Foocruft. Luis Marcel at the resort, where he's going... I need your guy in Ohio to get us more info. There's a pattern here. And we're not gonna solve it by sitting in this conference room. What I'm asking you could cost you your jobs... maybe more. But I can't sit by and allow 9/11 to happen again. We've got to do something to... - Protect America. - Exactly. - You gonna ask him? - No need to, this is what we're trained to do. - I'll let Erik know. - Thanks, brother. [PHONE RINGING] - Carlene, I'm glad you... - Soup, I'm gonna be blunt. Officially I'm required to tell you to cease and desist. What, why? Because the threat isn't considered credible. CARLENE: It wasn't my call. Personally, I think you're on to something but, I'm glad at least someone is remaining vigilant during an era of political correctness and bruised egos. I have to run. But don't stop what you're doing, and as a favor to me, be discreet. Oh, don't worry, I'm always discreet. Erin, I'm gonna need you to set up a deployment schedule. Alex, I need secure comps for both teams. Have 'em go to dinner and meet back in here for the warning order. Roy's deposited the funds in the account for the operation. I want troops in the field tonight. Yes, sir. Kamal, you're coming with me. - Where are we going? - To a party. - Wear a suit. - Seriously? - JOE: Are you Mr. Whit? - GENE: I am. - Carlene sent me. - You called Carlene? - What do you want from me? - And you must be Gabby. Yes. Yes, sir. I'm gonna need to speak with Gabby alone. No, the girl's gonna stay with us. - Yeah. - Okay. Gabby, I'm Wayne Schaffer, I work with Mr. Whit's daughter. I need you to tell me everything that you discussed with those gentlemen, and in great detail. And then I'm gonna ask you to do something that's gonna take a lot of courage. What? I need you to take this flash drive and put it in the USB port in all your friend's computers. But you got to do it without them knowing. You gonna be able to do this? GABBY: Yes. All right, good. Well let's take it from the top here. I think it's... very awesome those guys would risk their careers maybe even their lives to follow the threat and try to stop it. SOUP: It is. You would know. So are you gonna tell me where we're going? So you gonna tell me what's going on? The missing Al-Qaeda leaders that disappeared... they didn't disappear. I know. I know they didn't disappear. They're not with other groups. They're being held by United States. What? After Osama Bin Laden's death, your CIA partnered with the Iraqi government to secretly capture the last remaining commanders of Al-Qaeda. It was a trick. The Iraqis promised them protection, they didn't. They turned them over to the CIA. - That makes no sense. - Think about it. The Americans had just killed the most wanted man in the world. His men needed protection. One by one they came in secrecy and one by one they were turned over to the Americans. - SOUP: Gitmo? - No. No. A separate prison inside the United States. No way, they could never keep that a secret. They did. How do you know this? One of the men, Muhammad Jiran... is my brother. He was a double agent. He was offered this deal. My father told him not to go, and like he feared, Muhammad never came home. Iraqi regime, of course, denies turning any of these men over but it happened. How'd your brother get arrested if he was a double agent? Because he's still gathering intel from the prisoners being brought in. These men talk in prison and my brother listens. If you want to find out anything global terrorism, The Perfect Day, trigger, the infrastructure, strategy of an attack, I need to talk to him. SOUP: Kamal, I'm gonna need you to stay in the truck. I got all dressed up and rode here for you to leave me in the car? This isn't the right place for you to be seen... at least not yet. Don't worry, I'll bring you something. - [MUSIC PLAYING] - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] What are you doing here? What about this is discreet? Don't worry, you can trust me. [SIGHS] So you, um, come alone? Kind of. - Hello. - Hi. I'm sorry, son, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. [SOUP SCOFFS] No one invited you, Soup, it was a gesture of good will. I didn't actually think you would come. Yet, here I am. But you are late, that's strike one. - WAITER: Ladies. - CARLENE: Thank you. - JUDY: You should try one. - I'm good. My wife made those personally, lieutenant. - That's strike two. - Sir, can I have a moment? Sure. What do you know about The Perfect Day? What do you know about the secret prison that's holding top level Al-Qaeda operatives... right here in the United States? And that's strike three. Good to see you again, Campbell. Went that well, yeah? Do you trust me, Kamal? You're the only one I do trust. [KEYS RATTLING] ERIN: Everyone's in the field, sir. - Expecting someone? - Yup. Any minute now. I need to talk to you. Last night, what were you talking about with the admiral? Have you lost your mind? What are you doing? You have a known international terrorist saying things like The Perfect Day on a phone call traced back to Heathrow Airport. You have increased chatter of threats. You have a secret prison harboring terrorists illegally. You have a suspected terrorist making multiple trips into the US under the radar through Canada carrying large amounts of cash. Small operatives are preparing for something big. Just yesterday, an Arabic man was spotted in eastern Ohio buying 2,500 pounds of ammonium nitrate. We're running our own investigation. - [THUD] - Listen Paul, if they find out we're on to them, it's over. You have any men on this? - Possibly. - Who, where? I can't tell you that. Something's going to happen and I think it's going to happen really soon. We believe an event is going to trigger simultaneous attacks. - What kind of event? - Something big, and I think I've got an idea to find out. We need to get someone inside that secret prison. What? First, nothing like that exists. And second, even if it did exist, - how would you get someone... - Kamal. - Who? - Adetra Jiran, the man outside. He was a paid interpreter for the SEAL teams back in Iraq. Turns out, he knew a lot. His family had strong ties back to Al-Qaeda. He risked his life and his family to provide us crucial information. After the war, US abandoned him. Tied up his Visa application in tons of red tape. I got him here. Got him a new name and a new life. He now works for us. And? His family thinks he's dead. His cover as an interpreter was never compromised. That man is his brother. Paul, you know as well as I do, if something big really is going to happen, those men would know about it. Even from inside that prison... they would know the strategy. So what's your plan? [METAL RUSTLING] - Well, did he agree? - He's checking on it. Boss, boss you have to see this to believe it. These fliers are popping up everywhere. "Join the fight against the west. Materialism will leave you empty. False prophets are destroying America, join us on Facebook." - Are you kidding me? - It was on a community bulletin board at an airport in Minneapolis. One of operatives snapped a picture of it. I love this country but the fu... We have fought and are still fighting, even dying, so that other people out there can express their rights through garbage like that. When is enough gonna be enough? If you don't like our country, if you don't like our culture, if you don't like our freedoms, there's the door, use it! Not you Paul, come on in. Chairman Burns is good with your proposal. Under two conditions. I oversee the operation and one of our guys comes down here to get familiar with whatever it is you're doing here. He'll report his findings back to us... and I will make the decisions on how to proceed. No offense Paul, I'm good with all of it, but if you're gonna have someone down here spying on us, we get to pick the agent. - Who? - Agent Whit. - No. - No deal. Okay, Campbell. I will have Agent Whit report here tomorrow, but let me be clear, I want to know everything. Agent Whit's already on my short list. So if I don't get everything... It's all good buddy, we're all on the same team, right? Have your guy... drive his car... to this address. We'll take care of the rest. Do I need to bring a bomb or will one be provided? Just show up. She's the best intel operative they have. ALEX: Fine, all right. At this point, I don't care. How sure are we of the Canadian IP address? Go ahead and do the instillation. Um... Basic service I guess for now. Um, just set it up... but make it soon. Cable guy. Don't make it too soon, you have an assignment. [SIGHS] Okay. Carlene wants Gabby to make contact with Luis. Are you ready? So you gonna wish me luck? SOUP: Kamal. I know. No, you don't. You've done more for this country and it's national security than... most people I know. Be careful... and come back safe. JOHN: Get the engines ready. We leave tomorrow. We can't drive any further than this without being seen. THOMAS: Islamberg. Apparently, they have other camps called Islamtown and Islamville. Huh. - Let's follow him. - All right. [ENGINE WHIRRING] WAITRESS: Hi, welcome to O'Neil's. How many? - Hi, um... Oh, I'm with him. - WAITRESS: Okay, sure. ♪ Cast your stone Throw all you got at me ♪ Hi, Dean.

More information on the explosives are slowly... WOMAN: Hey, can you turn that up? NEWSCASTER: Adetra is the younger brother of Al-Qaeda operative Muhammad Jiran who is suspected to have joined the terrorist regime, ISIS. They ought to kill that man. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm not sure. Do you know him? No, no. I just... - Hey, hey, it's okay. - It's not okay. I'm supposed to do something. Something when that happens. What are you supposed to do? - I can't. - Give me the bag, Dean. ALEX: He's being taken there now. SOUP: Keep an eye on him. CARLENE: Campbell. Have you lost your tiny frog-sized mind? Hi, Erin. It's good to see you too, Carlene. Seriously, have you lost your mind? - Maybe. - Hey Alex, let's, uh, take this to the conference room. CARLENE: Oh, hi Alex. Carlene, we're watching Kamal's every move... - as best we can. - Soup, he's on his own. I know. Listen, we have to find the trigger. We've got to do something to stop this national tragedy. Let me show you what we got. You kept this? After all this time. Yeah. [GRUNTS] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] All that these old men know that new generation of rebel are at war. Educate them. Maybe, they came from Egypt... to attend universities. All the guys. [CROWD CHEERING] [CROWD CHEERING] - [GUNSHOTS FIRING] - [YELLING] You really have everyone worked up over this perfect day theory. I don't know, Carlene. What if it all happened? It's just too much coincidence. An ISIS leader talks about the perfect day. A guy buys 2,500 pounds of fertilizer. Islamic extremist groups are popping up all over the US. Some guy from Canada is bringing in thousands, if not millions of dollars across the border unknown. - Wait, Canada? - Yeah. Some guy's made a dozen trips into the US via Lake Erie. There's a man from Canada that we believe is targeting kids through video games to perform acts of violence in schools. We... Soup, you'll never believe this. At a local school during a basketball game, this man attempted a mass shooting. But the locals jumped him before he had a chance. Oh my. The FBI field office in Grand Rapids just interviewed a man who was hired to take revenge on his former employer. It says, "The man paid him 20,000 dollars to buy firearms to kill people from the place of work where he was recently terminated. The man turned himself in, and told the FBI that he was to conduct the killing spree on the same day a bombing was to occur." He said it was supposed to happen this month, and he thought when Kamal was arrested the mission was a failure. Carlene, it's the same guy. So, this guy is funneling in cash and hiring terrorists to perform these types of attacks? I mean, this guy in Grand Rapid, the school in Denver, the kids in Florida. How many more would there be? Countless. Kamal. You've got to get him out of that prison. Hi, I'm sorry. Could I bum a cigarette? It's been a rough week. It'd just be one. So where you from? Dallas. What brings you out this way? My brother brought my here. When our parents got killed in a car accident, drunk driver. He moved our family here to get away from the western culture, you know. Away from the crime, drugs... the evil. Now we live under, uh... the ruling of our Holy Imam. Yeah, he's a spiritual leader who guides our lives. - Like a commune? - No. Our community is of like-minded people. Though it's religious in nature it's... it's a bond between brothers and sisters. We're always looking for new believers. - Believers? - Yeah. I'm a follower of Islam. And uh, as a Muslim woman, I believe in Allah and the teachings of Muhammad. We would sacrifice our own lives for our beliefs. We're striving for a perfect future world, a global califate of... of only believers. Yeah? And those who don't believe, they should be converted... or punished. You know what I think? I think you hide behind the teachings of Islam without really understanding the religion at all. I have Muslim friends, they're doctors and teachers. My nieces play with their kids. My brother fought in Iraq alongside Muslims who believe in freedom, real freedom, and religious diversity. Your view of Islam is nothing more than a twist of distortion of your faith. And gives good Muslims, like my friends, a bad name. - Yeah. - [CLEARING THROAT] This conversation's over. You know what... your justice is coming. [TRAIN HORN BLARING] [SIGHS] I can't believe the gall of these people. Living in our country and enjoying our freedoms, yet, creating their own communities and talking about how they want to punish us for our beliefs. - They're... they're just... - Brainwashed? Are they dangerous? Possibly. Would they blindly do whatever some crazed religious leader told them to do? I think so. And that's what scares me. We have to stop these radicalized ideologies that disguise themselves under religion. We have to find these camps and communities that are hiding in plain sight within our borders and shut them down. Got it, thanks. That was the FBI. They're partnering with the ATF, DEA, and the state police to conduct these raids. We're just waiting on California and Montana. - When? - Midnight tonight, sir. SOUP: Okay. Right now, we have 14 attorney generals agreeing to conduct simultaneous raids on the camps. The governor of Colorado says, bring in the troops, he doesn't want this terrorist activity conducted in his state, his exact words. That's great. - CARLENE: Kamal's out. - ERIN: What? - SOUP: Yes. - CARLENE: He's fine. CARLENE: Alex, look up an Egyptian student at Ohio State. SOUP: Do you have him on the phone? Not yet, he's still being debriefed. We have 34 students that transferred to Ohio State, and the last three was from Egypt. SOUP: Okay, cross reference those with local police, uh, religious affiliations. ERIN: Maybe someone studying engineering. - SOUP: Yeah. - CARLENE: Religion. Finances. Find a kid who's current on his bills and probably off campus. ALEX: Azzi Hidal and Beiber Sethos. Oh, this is our guy. Azzi Hidal works as a part time security guard at Lakeside Storage Unit. Yesterday at 1800, he tweeted Quran 8:39, "Fight them all until all opposition ends and all submit to Allah." Erik, it's Soup. Alex is gonna send the information to Niki. ERIK: Yeah, it's coming in now. - NIKI: Got it. - Now, if we can find this guy, we may have a chance to stop this whole thing. It's a left here. RYAN: Niki, what is it? We're going to his dorm. He won't be mixing a bomb in a dorm. The report says... Azzi works at a storage unit. Erik, this is only a few miles away from here. - ERIK: Is that a blue van? - Looks like it. [TIRES SCREECH] ERIK: All right. Ryan, you go around the back. Niki, you take the front. I'll circle around and see what I can see. - NIKI: Yes, sir. - RYAN: Copy that. [CAR BEEPING] [GRUNTS] Police, don't move! ERIK: Get your hands up! Get your hands up! [GUNSHOT] ERIK: Everybody good? NIKI: Yeah, I'm good. ERIK: He's gone. ERIK: Call the local authorities and get 'em out here. RYAN: Roger that. [PHONE RINGING] - ERIK: Soup. - SOUP: Is everyone okay? ERIK: Everyone is okay. SOUP: We have to make sure this stays off the news - and the internet. - ERIK: All right. SOUP: Over 34 compounds in the United States were raided that night. They didn't see it coming. Over 100 national fugitives were found in these camps. Charges ranging from petty larceny, to rape, even murder. Suicide bomb vests were found along with stockpiled explosives and weapons. They found assassination plots, large amounts of American currency, and automatic unregistered firearms. Luis was found with over 100,000 dollars in cash. And they found a flight reservation in his name to Florida. After high school, Gabby joined the United States Marine Corp. From what I've been told, there was one heck of a sendoff party. As for Dean in Grand Rapids, he had some issues to work out but Allie remained close to him. Roy ran for senate and won. We all campaigned for him. Kamal was a bit bummed he couldn't work the campaign trail. Turns out you can't be an international terrorist and help support a political campaign in the United States. Or maybe you can. As for me. Well, Carlene and I worked out our differences. We decided we were much better together than apart. So she finally made an honest man of me.
