If it's Maleo Air, should I do it now or what? Maleo Air, you should wait! They're shuffling at the moment. I heard there'll be new investors. So, you should wait. Is it true that Iskandar Group wants a piece of it? Are you trying to trap me? See you. -See you, Miss Nina. -Thank you. -See you next week. -See you. You conference call with Mr Iskandar and Mr Anthony. You can do that on the way to the Awarding Night. And... That's the notary who is taking care of your villa in Tawangmangu. The one you bought two years ago. The transfer of ownership hasn't been completed yet. Yes, okay. It's best to take care of it as soon as possible, Miss. Hey. -Careful with the painting. -Okay. You are the most beautiful thing in my life. You make me feel like I don't need anything else in this life. You make feel like the luckiest man alive. And I like the feeling. And I would like to continue feeling that way. 'Cause it's nice. We've been through a lot together. Boston. New York. And now, here. Yasnina Putri, will you be my wife? Of course I will marry you. I thought you were going to say no. I was about to say no, dude. No, say yes. It's perfect. But it's forever, right? -You aren't going to take it off. -It'll stay forever. -Okay. -Okay. Okay? We have to go. Carl. -Hello. -Hello. Surya, my man. -How are you? -I'm good. -You remember Nina? -Hi. Of course. How could I forget? New Year husband. There are not many women who leave their boyfriend... ...for business meeting in New Year's eve. It's fine. It was a very important meeting. So you seem to be collecting awards. Are you ready for another award then? Through and through. Look at this. -It's so pretty! -It's beautiful. -Congratulations! -Thank you. Hey, lovebirds! -Hello! How are you? -Hey, Rio. I'm good. -Nina! -Hey. -Nina, thank you so much. -Yeah. -But you know what? -Crisis averted. -Hell, yeah. -Great. Thank God, my dad wasn't having a stroke. And everything is back to normal, huh? -Yeah. -Okay. -Okay. -Iâ€™m going to the toilet. Okay. What do you think? Do you think it's possible for Arifin Iskandar's favorite protege... ...win again this year? There are people who believe that money's involved. But I don't think she will win. She's facing a scandalous case this year. Are you serious? I'm not the only one who knows about it. Even the judges know about it, too. They're just holding back because of the big boss. What do you mean? -Hey, San. -Hey! Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. And now we've come to the ultimate award of this evening. The Investment Manager of the year. -This year nominees are... -Are you okay? Very exciting. We're about to find out the recipient of Gold Award... ...in the 7th Annual Global EFEA 2019 is... ...Carlo Agustino from Captura Management House. -Good morning, Miss. -Morning. -Good morning. -Morning. Becoming a celebrity was not easy. It used to take a very long process. But now, whoever gains considerable amount of followers... ...they are entitled to be Instagram celebrities. I'm jobless. I don't know what I have to do. I'm poor. Mrs Imelda, from what I see here, ...your financial situation is safe. Of course, I was kidding. You are not poor at all. Okay. There are only two things that are absolute and certain in this world, ...death and changes. Our only option is to maximize the profits and to minimize the losses. -Thank you. -I'll make sure... ...you are making the right choice if you follow my advice. Thank you for everything. Relax. Enjoy your life. -Bubye. -Bye. Miss. Stakeholder meeting, Tower 1 at the office -in about 15 minutes. -Okay. -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. Any comment about the alleged investment fraud, Miss? Please, Miss. Just a short comment. -Miss, sorry. -Miss, just a short comment please. If you have any question, you can send them via e-mail. Miss Yasnina, we only need a moment. -Can you explain your involvement... -Miss Nina, please. Your comments. We know Yasnina Putri as the financial expert... ...who won the Investment Manager of the Year successively. -So, what are your views on that? -I think she's guilty. Similar cases like this one are quite common... ...in countries adapting the free market system. We have Bernard Madoff case in 2008. We have to do something about this, sir. The regulation should be updated regularly to prevent some recalcitrant financial services that always find their ways... My career, my reputation, and my life are at stake, sir. Relax. Well, the first person who is going to be the suspect is me, sir. Only you can protect all of us. Especially me. Listen to me. Think about this. You said I am the only person who can save my own company, ...do you think it's possible if I just sit around and watch? Don't worry. Everything will be just fine. I promise you. I'll be responsible in keeping your safety. It's that enough? Oh, right. One more thing. You need to go to Singapore with Surya in two days. Go and meet Mr Lee. Bring all the documents that will be prepared from here. Ask him to sign them. Dy? Dy, please contact Mr Surya. Sorry, write this down first. Just a moment, Miss. Good morning. Okay, will do. Sorry, Miss Nina. The board member is expecting you right now. What is this? You said everything will be fine. You promised you'll be responsible for our safety. This company owes me a lot. I brought you all this client. But the client that you brought to this company... ...is now demanding their rights. Or they will file a lawsuit. The media is now focus on this problem. You're the one who trapped and made us got involved in this scandal. And you tried to runaway. You ask me to go to Singapore with Surya. Sur, tell your father! Surya is in Melbourne... ...since yesterday. You don't know Surya is in Melbourne? Or are you too busy? Doing what, exactly? -Sir! No. -Call the security! -Security! -Calm down. Surya won't let anything bad happens to me, sir. Please leave this room, Miss. Esti! Esti! Why did you come so late, Nin? -What is it, Ti? -Nin, you've got a company. I remember that one. Those kids were so happy. Oh, that one, too. The roof would collapse without our donation. Yeah. This orphanage will always be your home. Don't be offended. This is not a gift, but a loan. -You can return it any time. -Where have you been? I'm sorry, Nin. I... I was in a difficult position. Try to put yourself in my shoes. -Imagine if you lose everything. -No, you don't lose everything. You still have that asset in Tawangmangu. You can sell it and use the money to rebuild your career, your life... ...our live. Just think of this as an additional operational cost. Please, Nin. Help me to redeem what my father did to you. Let me help you. Arifin Iskandar created two fake offshore companies. So, the funds from clients were invested in those companies. And... Well... About 95 percent of it was indeed Arifin Iskandar's idea. He asked for my advice... ...on how this scheme could be approved by his clients. Then I brought these big clients to those companies. So, Arifin asked for my help, and he promised to protect me. You're going against is a major player. A very powerful person. So, you sure you're ready? I'm sure. Do you have any remaining assets? Nothing. Surya. Are you sure you don't want to drink? No, thanks. What about you? Miss, I may have one. Tawangmangu? I have one asset, a house. It's fully paid, I only need to complete the transfer of ownership. That's my only asset. You can use it as one of your ammunition. It always amazes me... ...to see a man supporting his partner through hardship like this. My previous husband, I don't exactly remember which, he was also like that, you know? -What about my injunction, Miss? -Hah? -My injunction. -Oh right. Go on. In short, he promised to protect me, but instead, he trapped and humiliated me. This is my client from Shanghai. I have to answer the call. Just a minute. Hello. Auntie. Calm down, Auntie. Inhale. Exhale. She's a nervous wreck. Remember, you are dealing with a very powerful person. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. I've got to do this. And I'm not forcing you, Sur. The hot one is for you, Miss. The cold one is for you, sir. -Dy. -Yes, Miss? No more "miss", call me Nina from now on. Thank you, Sur, for being here. It's all I want. To be with you. I'll do whatever I can... ...to help you. No. Don't. Don't do that. Don't make a promise you can't keep, Sur. You heard what the lawyer said. I'm going against a very powerful person. And for you, Sur, not only he's powerful, he's your own father. I cannot... He's your family, Sur. This is my battle, okay? -Just can't. -Nin. Listen to me. Honestly. Don't you think I've thought about everything... ...before I made this decision? I'm a man. I decide what to do. I choose what to do. And I choose to be with you. I am with you because this is my decision. I have faith in you. I have faith in us. I love you. Now, the only thing you need to do... ...is allow me to be here with you. Are you? I've got you. I need you to be here with me. I love you, too, Sur. Excuse me! Excuse me! She's on a paes call! Sorry, what did you say? She went to bridal make-up job. Where are you from? You're from the city, huh? Yes, I'm from Jakarta. I need to see Mrs Koes Marjanti. I need her signature. -Are you from the bank? -No, I'm not. I just need to see her. We have a business. -Do you know where Mrs Koes Marjanti is? -I do. -Can you take me there? -No! -Where are you going? -I'm going to see Mrs Marjanti. -Let me go with you! -Come on. Ouch! I'm not ready for the wedding ceremony. My wedding suit doesn't fit me, it'll be embarrassing. Everyone, calm down. I have the stuff Mrs Marjanti asked before. We need this. Surely this will work. Enough, calm down. The bride and groom will get married for sure! Please wait! Ma'am, please tell her the item is ready. Yes, she will come out soon. I'll be waiting here. Miss, what are you doing here? I told you to wait in front of the house. I am the buyer of Mrs Koes Marjanti's house. I need her signature. That's all I need. I'll go home after she signs this. Whatever! You can't be here. Treat yourself eat some soto, enjoy some jenang. -It's fine, I'll wait here. -Why don't you listen to me? Don't be so stubborn. This is an emergency. -This can bring... -To, follow me! Yes, Ma'am. -Mrs Marjanti! -No. That's enough. Miss, this can bring misfortune. Look! It's on you! -Ma'am! -Stop! Ma'am! Mrs Marjanti! Everyone, please leave. I'll fix it. -The wedding suit won't fit, ma'am. -What's wrong? -The wedding suit is too small. -I know, Son. Be patient. There's no need to sulk. -Darto, get me some water. -Yes, ma'am. It will fit you. Just calm down. It won't fit me. The wedding is ruined for sure. No, it isn't. Have some water. -Thank you, ma'am. -Relax. I'll try to fix it. Oh I know what's wrong. Yes. What are you doing here? This is a sacred ritual. Mrs Marjanti is not an ordinary person. You should go. We both can be sacrifices for demonic ritual. -To. -Yes, ma'am. -Give me the cigarette. -Yes, ma'am. -Please, put this on again. -Yes, ma'am. It fits you now, right? -It fits me, ma'am. -Surely. I can fasten the buttons now. -When you're the head of your family, -Yes, ma'am. ...please remember, every problem has a way out. -But you have to be patient. -Everyone! The wedding suit fits him. We can proceed with the wedding! Thank God! The bride and groom will have their first night together. Excuse me! Sorry. Excuse me! Ma'am, just a moment. Sorry. I need your signature. It's for the power of attorney for the house I've bought. I have to go and meditate. Please come again tomorrow. But the house is right fully mine now. Excuse me. Please. I have to go back to Jakarta tonight. Tomorrow morning. At my house. The long-awaited one has come. Soon, I will get a successor. Please pray that she's the one, dear. So? I will buy this house back from you. Okay, that's interesting. Two years ago, I bought this house for two billion rupiahs. Back then, our remaining debt at the bank was just 400 million rupiahs. We asked for grace period, but before the negotiation, ...the bank had put this house for auction. -So? -Well, I'm offering 175 million rupiahs to buy it back. That's more or less the only money I have. We offered more to the bank at that time. -But I'm not from the bank, ma'am. -But you need this house, right? The certificate is still in my husband's name. But I expect more than that, ma'am. Much more. Here's the thing, ma'am. The current sales value is... It's okay if you don't accept my offer. Ma'am, I only ask for what is legally my right. Okay, this is my proposal. You just need to help me. I will give you a portion of the sale. Five percent. Ten percent? Ma'am, please understand my position. I have to sell this house immediately. You need to understand my position as well. I've lived here for 50 years. I don't have other houses anymore. Twenty percent. Twenty five, twenty five percent. I have one condition. I have three weddings to handle for the next three months. I want you to stay here and help me as my assistant. We have a room that you can use while you stay here. Hey, you. -What is up? -I'm in Tawangmangu now. Good. -Good? I am far from good. -But... -She wants me to stay here for 3 months. -Nin. -Calm down. Just breathe. -Do you know what that means? She's crazy. It doesn't make sense at all. Nin, stop. Anything you need, you can have Ardy do it for you. -I can send your clothes later. -I can buy my own clothes, Sur. Great. Listen. Everything will be all right. Your father told me exactly the same thing! Nin, I am not my father. Come on, Nin. I am still the same person. Miss. That's was a video call from your boyfriend, eh? He's good looking, but not fascinating. Miss Nina. Wakey, wakey. Miss Nina. Sleeping Nina. -What? -Miss Nina. To. -You can leave. -Ma'am. Let's go, come with me. -Do we have a deal? -Do you have a choice? Come on. What kind of woman straddle her legs like this? Move a little. Here. Take this. -Stop here. -Yes, ma'am. -Here is the money. -Thank you, ma'am. These are the flowers used for offerings. Buy some flowers. Nin. Nin. Let's go. Nin, don't sleep here. Come on. Now, do the knee crawling. -Do I have to? -Down. Put your hands at the front. Taking a bath in seven different springs... ...is one of the processes to be a pemaes. Come on, go take a bath. How did you end up being a pemaes? Just like that. The art of paes is a knowledge passed down through generations. My grandmother taught my mother. My mother was the last woman in my family... ...who taught me paes. So, your daughter will be a pemaes? I don't have children. You are going to stay here for months. Won't anyone come looking for you? -What about your boyfriend? -Boyfriend? Fiance. I have a fiance. But, I don't know if I can marry... ...the son of the man who put me through this misery. We studied in America together. Then, we got close before we returned to Indonesia. Surya is actually my late husband's best friend. After my husband died in an accident, Surya has always been by my side. We were actually like brother and sister. When he moved to Jakarta, Surya's father asked me to work for him. And before the incident, Surya proposed to me. Did you said yes? Anyway, I will use this house to be my ammunition... ...to take my revenge on Surya's father. Okay. But what about Surya? Well, he said he will help me. Surya is different from his father. They are like poles apart. His father don't trust him, but he has no other choice because Surya is his only child. I think it's my fate to be jomblo, and I don't mind. All right. But tomorrow is your weton, birthday in Javanese calendar. I saw it in the power of attorney the other day. If it's really your date of birth, then tomorrow is your weton. My weton. It's Jumat Kliwon, right? Look at you barged in. Wait, what is a "jomblo"? Jomblo is individuals... ...destined with bad luck to be a bujang. Bujang is a man or woman... ...who's never experienced any sexual intercourse. I am jomblo, by the way. -To, what is mutih? -Mutih is... Listen. Mutih is like detox. Detox for the soul and detox of the past. I'm just clearing my throat. -To, take this inside. -Yes. Mutih is a ritual... ...for those who want to achieve perfection, by fasting and practicing abstinence. Your foods and drinks are all white. All white. I thought city people knew everything. Thank you very much... ...for agreeing to help our family. When I saw you perform for Mrs Retno's daughter wedding, I told my husband... ...to ask you to be the pemaes for Ayu's wedding as well. So that, people will be mesmerized. Yes, if God's willing. But I have a concern. I don't have much money. Don't worry about that. -I am happy just to help. -Thank you very much. You are welcome. Peace be upon you. -Come here! -And peace be upon you, too. Ma'am, this is my groom-to-be, Banyu Rifki. Sorry, I am late. I had to deliver screen prints to customers. Ayu and Rifki met through their business together. That's right. We opened a business, and ended up together. Then, we're getting married. That's good. Nin, please bring some more tea for Rifki. What is this? Mutih means you can only eat rice and water. You don't eat anything white like this. It's only three sips of water and three mouthfuls of rice. -To. -Yes, ma'am. -Eat this. -Huh? -Don't forget the milk. -But I'm on a diet. Pack on the pounds! You don't need any diet. -Great, all white. -You'll be healthy. Now this for you. Eat this. City kids simply cannot be trusted. If you play around once again, ...I'll take this phone away until your debt is paid off. Hey, first of all, I don't have any debt. And second... You're a woman, why are you so rude? I won't let my daughter act like you. You're so defiant. That's probably why you don't have any children. I am not afraid. I'm just worry that I won't fulfill my duty. This can't be the end of paes. Ma'am, I want to apologize. -Where's Darto? -He went home. Is he your nephew? No. He's just my neighbor's child. Can I ask you a rather personal question? During Ayu's family visit the other day, ...you said that money is not important. Then, why are you doing it if you don't make any money? It's not like money is not important. It's also not about whether I make some money or not. We're talking about the wholeheartedness... ...of carrying out our responsibilities. Their inability to pay my service is not their fault. Blessings and earnings have all kinds of way to come to you. Paes is a job... ...you have to complete once you accept it. Ayu locked herself in her room since last night. She wants to call off the wedding. What to do? Just a minute. Calm down. We will find a way out. -Sweetheart? -I don't want to do it! Wait a minute. Ayu? I don't want to! What to do now? Now what? -Calm down. -Excuse me. Ayu. This is Nina. No. Calm down. I don't know what to do. Our screen printing business doesn't do well. Rifki couldn't get a job, no matter how hard he tries. Not to mention we're in a bad financial situation. I already pawned the motorbike for the wedding expenses. What if we have children later? What if we can't buy a house? It will be too hard for me to stay with my in-laws. What will we do about our children education? Everything is not easy nowadays. It's better if we cancel the wedding. So, you don't want to get married because of your financial situation? Yes. May I say something? There are many ways, Yu. Really? If you follow my advice, I will make sure you make the right decisions. Calm down. Don't be upset. Thank God. Look at you, Sweetheart. Draw the gajahan first. The one that looks like duck eggs. She looks very pretty. -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. -Mr Is is here yet? -Yes, he is. This way, please. -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. -How are you? -Great. Please sit down. Yes, thank you. What is it, Mr Is? So, here's the thing. I have two news. The first one is good news. And the second one is also good news. My son, Surya, has found his future wife. So, me and my friend, an important figure in the country. He's a relative of royal family. We are going to marry off our children as soon as possible. Of course we will consider the good date and weton. And I would like to have you, Mrs Mar, as the one who bless their wedding. What do you think? What is it? Honestly, sir. It will be a difficult task for me. I have something personal to take care of. Are you sick? No. Mrs Marjanti. You have helped my family for so long. So, I feel obliged to hand Surya's wedding to you. This is the last wedding in my family. We probably will need to wait for 25 years, before the next one. And it'll be for Surya's child. If you're not around, what are we supposed to do? For the wedding of Surya's child, you can count on my successor. -Successor? -Yes. I have found a successor. So, there's nothing to worry about, right? No, there isn't. Can you refuse a job from my family? Of course, not. Thank you. Tomorrow, I'm going to Solo. Surya is bringing a prospective buyer. Once the house is sold, your 25 percent cut, I will transfer it immediately. Please, no rush. I trust you. I will miss the atmosphere of this house. I will come to visit you wherever you live. You can return whenever you want. Wherever I am, my house will always be your home. These fishes are getting bigger and bigger. Look, they will have a bright future. Hey, Surya! -Surya. -Uncle Sugeng. -How are you? -I have never been better, Sur. -And how about you? -I'm well. Fin, look. From what I see, Surya will have many children to continue your empire. Come on, you're exaggerating. Sur, he has a dinner reservation at Vong Kitchen for tonight. You can come, right? -Actually I... -Of course you can! I have a meeting then. Sur, forget the job. Relax, man! Excuse me. Yeah, Honey? Yeah, I'm at Arifin's place. What are you doing tonight exactly? I have a question for you. What did I do... ...to deserve your hostility, and rebelling behaviour? Why? Did I fail you as a parent? Nina has nothing to do with that investment fraud. She is a victim. And I have to defend her... In what position? Her future husband? Now, which one is more important? Your future wife, your family, or everything that has got to do with your future and your life? Which one? You're threatening me? I just want the best for you. But if you see this a threat, what can I do? Yes, Nin? He should be there. Excuse me, do you want to order more, Miss? Yeah, sure. Okay. May I take this? Excuse me. So, now what? Our lawyer is at my dad's house. Do you understand what I mean? It's not that I don't want to help, but I can't. He knows. He knows everything. I've brought something... Because... Why are you still here, Dy? I can't give anything to you anymore. Well, I feel like... ...I get more than when I worked for you. Can I say something honestly? You are my role model. Sorry. It's okay not to be okay. You don't want to go back to Jakarta? If we leave now, I think we can catch the last flight. Or maybe the night train? You are as stubborn as rocks, child. When is... ...the upcoming wedding? The prayer or mantra of a pemaes... ...will contribute to the success of the wedding. Seriously? Now, couples get divorced... ...just because they forget to put the toilet seat down. Or if they forget to say 'I love you' every day. Everything is so modern... ...that so many couples split up because of social media. From the experience of my marriage, everyone cried... ...when they listened to sembogo. How long was your marriage? It was 47 years. Do you know what I learned from those years? Not all marriages start with love. For many people, love is not the measurement for long-lasting marriage. In fact, sometimes, the short-lived love... ...can bring the greatest happiness. Everyone has different story. Don't compare your journey... ...against someone else's experience. It'll hold you back from being grateful. This is for me? Thanks. Is this the house? Come on. Salma arrived in Jakarta two days ago. She finished her master's degree in Manchester. She even hasn't unpacked her suitcase, yet she wants to come here ASAP. She wants to get to know you. I want to get to know you firsthand. It's good to know each other, right? We came here to talk about the wedding preparations, as well as to build relationships with Mrs Marjanti, -and... What's your name again? -Nina. Nina. Yes. A few days before the wedding day, we will have Mrs Marjanti and Nina go to Jakarta. Since it's only for the preparation, we go to Solo. Salma has to do something here. And I want to shop for Solonese batik for the bridesmaids and all. If you want to shop for batik, I can go with you. I know all the good shops in Solo. Okay. Let's do that. -That's great. -Yes. Thank you. How does it feel for you? Getting married? Are you excited? Quite nervous. So, my father and my fiance's father... ...have been best friends since their college days. Everything's fine. My fiance is kind, patient... ...have a great job, of course. Even if he runs the family business. And the other point is he's very, very handsome. -Handsome is good. -Right? Handsome is very good. What about you? Your husband? I'm single. Well, if you have to choose, would you like to have a man who's rich but stupid, smart but ugly or really handsome but poor? Wait. Do I have better choices? Just choose one. Okay, rich but stupid... What do you think about arranged marriage? Arranged marriage, like my fiance and I. What do you think? Well, I think there's nothing wrong with that. As long as they love each other. It's just the way they meet. Some... Thank you, Miss. Some people met through an arrangement, some meet accidentally. I was not at ease at first. Like arranged marriage is so outdated. But if you think about it, there's no guarantee we can find the right one by ourselves, right? So, I agreed with what my parents asked. After all, those who meet in the usual way... ...do not always end up with happy marriage, right? But, come to think of it, if someone asks me what kind of person I'm looking for, I will say I want someone who's reliable, who can protect and look after me. Yeah, I think that's what makes me happy. Love is important, but that's not my priority. Just take a look at those perfect Instagram couples, those lovey-dovey couples. I don't think they are really that happy. Right? It's just the image they want people to see. You make me really miss Jakarta. You've lived in Jakarta, too? No wonder you're so different than your mom. My mom? No! She's not my mom. I moved to Tawangmangu about eight months ago. I work for Mrs Marjanti. I see. But you both look a lot like each other. How's so? Really, you're like mother and daughter. You're kidding. Here. Just so you know, I was really nervous... ...to meet Mrs Marjanti. I didn't know her, and she's an elderly. But now, I'm really happy that my wedding is being taken care of by you. You'll be there. The pleasure is mine. Thanks again. I want to come here again. -But not for my wedding project. -Sure. -And you should go with me again. -Yes, of course. I want to make something about batik. Maybe for my feature fashion project or something else. How about for a thesis? Thesis? Thesis research about batik for my doctorate degree? Oh my God, that'd be really cool. -Cool, right? -I don't think that's a common idea! Oh my God, I'm so excited. Okay, I've got an idea. -What if you come with me to Jakarta? -Sure. I will introduce you to Surya and Mr Iskandar. So, you'll know them better. Mrs Marjanti knows them, but you haven't met them. Nina? Are you okay? Everyone! Everyone stabbed in the back! Everyone! Serving the royal palace... ...has always been my duty. That's my only intention, Nina. You should have known it. I told you all about my relationship with Surya. I told you everything. Now, Surya's getting married? Why didn't you tell me? I didn't mean to keep it from you. I just wanted to wait for the right time. -I don't have... -How could you? When is the right time? Until their wedding? And we're the ones who are performing the ceremony? I don't have the right to say no to Arifin Iskandar! Don't mention that name. It's the royal's calling. I have pledged to submit myself to the calling as long as I live. Paes is my only commitment. Nina. Nin... I understand. I understand the only thing matters in your life is paes. There is nothing else. Forgive me, God. -The sewing. -And when... Excuse me. Yes, Nin? What? Okay, wait. -Mike, I'm really sorry, but I have to go. -See you, bro. Taxi! What are your next plans? I don't know. Can I say something? After all this, maybe it's time to stop. Iskandar... ...framed me. Surya ran away from me, Mrs Marjanti betrayed me. I called you here not to lecture me. I didn't mean to lecture you. If there's someone in this world who has the right to lecture people, that person would be you. Hey! Let's go home, dear. Ma'am! Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am! My family and I... ...know Mrs Marjanti as pemaes very well. She was also a relative of the royal family for generations, ...her grandmother, her mother and herself. Unfortunately, she didn't have any children. And you, Nina... Mrs Marjanti trusted you to be her successor. I know you're still grieving. I also know it's not easy for you... ...to forgive and to forget what has happened between us. I didn't come here to ask you to forget and to forgive that. I'm... ...just asking you, to help us. Just this once. I'm sure you can find someone else, sir. Yasnina. The wedding will take place in less than 10 days. I'm asking for help, Nina. Time flies. The end is getting closer. I am not afraid to disappear from this world. I am just afraid that paes will perish. But God has answered my prayers. The girl has come. We met in the same dream. Immediately, I recognized her. She is like a little girl lost in the forest. Is she my future successor? Now, I try to relinquish myself. Because it's only when I relinquish myself I can see the way out. I only hope... ...that the girl can find the same relinquishment. Sur, to be honest, I don't have the answer. But no matter what, you are my pride, our pride. Nin, I'm sorry for Mrs Marjanti's death. Well, she's like... ...a mother to me. I'm happy to see you again. Nina, here's your cappuccino. Why haven't you drink my coffee? Is it not good? I'm going to. Just not yet. Enjoy. Right, I bumped into Mrs Imelda last week. I told her about your situation now. That you've lived in Tawangmangu. So, maybe she's moved. She wants to introduce you to some reliable lawyers... ...who want to handle your case. Pro bono, of course. And that is if you want to. Well... This is my battle, Dy. I will face it with all that I have. I will not run away. That's what I decided. It's not easy to find a pemaes in less than eight days. So, Fin, I think we should postpone it. Dear, we've sent out the wedding invitations. We've calculated their weton. Everything is ready. Can't we find another way? We can't have just any pemaes. She must have a connection with the royal palace. Exactly. Is, it is better to postpone the day. I will do Mrs Marjanti's duty. I will do this... ...to complete Mrs Marjanti's last obligation. How old are you, sweetie? I'm 29 years old, ma'am. But Mrs Marjanti had taught me everything. So I know what I have to do. Are you married? Salma once said that Nina is still single. Unmarried woman can't be a wedding shaman. But my husband once told me, Mrs Mar trusted Nina to be her successor. It's not that I don't trust her. This is about of customs and traditions. Even the President cannot change this. But if Mrs Marjanti trusted her, then I trust her. So there is nothing to worry about. It brings bad luck, I don't think it's a good idea. -Yes, I also object to that. -But... It's better that we postpone it. -Is there no other way? -Really, this is a bad idea. Nina had married. Nine years ago, she married Brett in New York. Yes, I married Surya's best friend. Then where is your husband? Are you divorced? He had passed away in an accident, ma'am. I did the fitting last week. But, it won't fit me now. It doesn't fit. What to do now? The guests have arrived. Excuse me. Please wait outside. Just a minute, please. It's okay, I'll go. It doesn't fit. Okay, okay. -With my friends. -Okay. It doesn't fit. What do you want? Nin. I know you very well. So whatever you have planned, please don't do it. Nin, this is my wedding. Here. Surrender. Surrender? Whatever do you mean? -What do you have planned for my wedding? -Trust me. Just trust me, okay, Sur? Now, take the suit off. -Take it off? Whatever for? -Surya... Do you trust me? Then take it off. I'll make sure you're making the right choice if you would. Have faith in me. I take Salma Kartika Ningrum, the daughter of Sugeng Prasetyo, as my lawful wedded wife with the dowry of a set of prayer items, and 80 grams of gold, in cash. Do the witnesses accept the validity of this marriage? Yes, we do. First, it symbolizes the throw of love... ...to your spouse's heart. Accepting the throw is the evidence... ...of your spouse's sincerity. Secondly, every impurity... ...disappears when the betel leaves touch the ground. Strong women... ...are those who are brave enough to remove any perils in her family. She has the bravery to purify the impurities in her family... ...and make it pure again. As the head of the family, the husband is responsible and must strive... ...for the safety, prosperity, and peace of his family. The husband must look after, protect and support his family. The wife is also responsible for sustaining the family... ...in safety, peace, and prosperity. Both the bride and the groom have seated comfortably. I will hand the matter back to the family. Thank you. And now, I believe in life.
