Finish them admin receipts, Charlie? Here they are, Mr Remington. Sorry, it was kind of a bad afternoon. Thanks, Charlie. Hey Charlie, have you seen Mr Remington around here anywhere? Yeah, he just picked up his cashbox. What kind of an afternoon you having? Kind of a bad one again. This show has sure had a lot of rough breaks, man. D'you know what? It's gonna get worse. What do you mean? Well, you know that Mr Shye, the attorney from Consolidated Circus Attractions? Well he just came on the lot a little while ago and he is looking for Mr Remington. You know, that outfit's not going to give up until they take over every independent in the country. They've got all the major circuses tied up. They've got all of the top engagements all tied up. What are we gonna do? D'ya know something, Mort? Mr Remington's not gonna sell out to ?em. Boy, I wouldn't be so sure about that! What d'you mean? Well, when I saw old Shye he had a look on his face like the cat that ate the canary. I drank the last of it?. Waiting for you. Surprised to see me, Mark? Not really, I've sort of been expecting to see you. It's been a long time, hasn't it, Mark? What's on your mind, Shye? Well, there's a nasty rumour going around the industry that... Now you've lost your main attraction the show's in trouble. Stopped by to see if I could be of any help. Thanks. But no thanks. Now if that's all?. No. Now that you bring it up it's not all. I was wondering if you had a chance to reconsider Consolidated's offer. What's the matter, Mort? You look as sad as these hippos. Remember: ?Laugh clown, laugh? Dan, there isn't much to laugh about when you know you don't have a pay check coming. Yeah. You've seen my brother? Yeah. He's over at the office. My show's not for sale, Shye. If it was, Consolidated's the last outfit I'd sell it to. Oh, excuse me Mark, I didn't know you were busy. No Danny, stick around. I'd like you to meet Arnold Shye from Consolidated Circus Attractions. This is my brother, Dan Remington. - How do you do, Mr Shye. - Danny. I was just telling Mark here he'd be smart to sell now before the show folds. Who says we're folding? We're doing alright up to now. Up til now? What are you driving at, Shye? Well Mark, I'm going to lay my cards right on the table. I suppose you know Consolidated's bought up your $83,000 bank note? - Why you... - Wait a minute. Now the note becomes due and payable within six months and according to our calculations based on your current profit and loss statements you're going to be bankrupt within three months. Now reconsider, Mark. Sell out now. We'll make sure you get a substantial profit. You've got a lotta guts coming around here, Shye. First you steal my main attraction with a big money deal then you've got the brass to come in here and try and squeeze me out. Well it won't work! Alright. Alright Mark, if that's the way you want it. But without a main attraction you're going to be bankrupt within three months and you know it. Don't you count on it! I've got a main attraction. Something so big it'll outdraw anything the circus world's ever seen! Oh, now now, Mark. Consolidated's got every major attraction under contract. And you know it. Who do you think you're kidding? I don't really care whether you believe me or not, Shye. Now get outta here, and stay out. Alright. Alright. But I'll be seeing you later, say in about six months. - Nice guy. - Isn't he, though? What's this about a new main attraction? You running some kind of bluff? No, it's? more like a gamble. I don't understand, what do you mean? You remember that wild animal dealer we bought those lions from last spring? Yeah, you mean Tunga Jack? He sent me a letter from Africa thanking us for the order. He gave me a list of other animals we could get if we needed any. You mean get some more wild animals from him? Now wait a minute, let me finish. He claims he knows the whereabouts of an overgrown gorilla. An overgrown what? Now that's the way he put it in his letter: an overgrown gorilla. Now just how overgrown is this uh?. Well, he didn't know the exact size, just that it's supposed to be huge. Oh, you mean he hasn't captured it yet. Well, the last I heard he hadn't. He wanted me to fund an expedition to the Congo to capture it. - Oh Mark, you must be kidding. - Look, Danny. Shye's right. We'll be bankrupt inside of three months unless we can come up with a new attraction. A real blockbuster. You think this King Kong's our answer? Yes I do. Over the last couple of weeks. I've been mulling trying to capture this gorilla. After Shye's visit I think that the time to do it is now. I don't know, it's a big gamble, Mark. It's a bigger risk for you. Well it's either that or wind up the way he has it figured. Whaddaya say? - What time does your plane leave? - I knew I could count on ya. - Can you handle the show yourself? - No problem. Charlie's a veteran, he'll help you over any rough spots. I'm gonna see if I can get the first plane out to Africa. Oh wait a minute, Danny. After I leave, call Commissioner Jeffreys and tell him when I'll arrive. I'm gonna call the airlines now and I'll give you a schedule. Right, I'll tell Charlie you're going. Bill? Mark Remington. Fine, and you? Good. The Commissioner get Danny's cable? How long will he be gone? Oh sure, that'd be great. Well where are you off to? I'll meet you right away. The gardens? Don't tell me you've turned zookeeper. Half an hour? Right. I'll find it, thanks. - Mark! Long time! - How's Danny? - Fine. He's minding the circus. New exhibit? Yeah. Tunga Jack brought them back from gorilla country last year. Listen Bill, I'm in sort of a hurry to get out to Jack's compound. Can we visit when I get back? Sure, the Land Rover's parked up at the office. Come on, I'll show you. Boss man. I'm sorry, but I don't understand. Do you speak English? - Yes, I speak English. - Well, I speak English also. My name is George. May I help you? Who's the boss around here? Well I'm sorry but the boss is with the water buffalo. - Where's the water buffalo? - In a pen. Where's the pen? Would you like to see the water buffalo? Well why don't I just see them both? - OK. Come on, I'll take you. - Thanks. Be reasonable, April. You're through with the animals here, so why don't you face it? - Who says I'm through? - I do. Who's gonna capture your animals for you now, huh? - I will. - You will?! Don't make me laugh. With the help of George and the boys I'll do very well, thank you George and the boys! Come off it will ya, you don't stand a chance. I caught this full grown water buffalo, didn't I? Something you were never man enough to do. Oh, not man enough, huh? OK, Great White Hunter suppose you come up with the money for this note of your father's if you're such a big success. I can't pay it right now and you know it. Then make me a little deal and I'll tear up the note. I'm not making any deals with you, Morgan. Okay. ?the Commissioner's Office, and attach this whole operation, lock stock and barrel! You'll be paid. This animal's worth far more to them than this note. And I'm shipping him out tomorrow. So you can forget getting your hands on my compound. Yeah, we'll see about that. George see him off my property. - Okay, Morgan. - Take your hands off me! I'm leaving. You wanted to see me? Oh I? I wanted to see your? I wanted to see Adams, the boss. Just April. Now what can I do for you, Mr?? Oh I'm sorry. Mark Remington, Remington International Service. Well, Mr Remington? Just Mark. If it's animals you want I'm afraid I can't... Oh I'm not buying I'm hunting. Hunting? Hunting what? I was told that I could find an animal dealer. Named Tunga Jack here. I'm afraid Tunga Jack is no longer here. Where is he? No one around here's seen him for several months. Well all the rotten luck, I've had to travel a few thousand miles to find out this Jack character's departed. Well I do apologise. Tunga Jack happens to be my father. - I'm sorry, I didn't know. - I'm in charge here now. Is there anything I can do for you? When will your father be back? To tell you the truth, Mr Remington?. My father is missing. Perhaps dead. He went on a safari into the interior several months ago to hunt for... A very rare species of giant ape. He hasn't returned. What about his partner, Dan Morgan? That was Morgan, he just charged out of here like a mad rhino. Oh, then Morgan buys the animals for the compound now? No, I buy, sell, and catch them myself. With the help of George and the native boys. Mr Morgan's gone now. Thank you, George. The plane won't be back until the morning. But I do have a spare room in the bungalow, if you like. Well thank you very much, if that isn't too much trouble. Not at all George, please see that Mr Remington's made comfortable and send Sam to the shipping scales to meet me please. Yes, Miss Adams. If you'll excuse me, Mr Remington, I have to get back to work. If you'll follow me I'll take you up to the house. Oh, yeah, oh yes. Busy girl, your boss, George. And that's about the whole story, Mark. - Thank you, George. - Thank you. Well, what about Morgan? He came around about three months after father'd gone. Said he must be dead Tried to buy me out. And when I turned him down, he took half his money and livestock and went downstream to open up his own compound. Didn't want a girl for a partner, is that it? More or less. He hopes I won't make a success of this so he can eventually buy me out at his own price. Because now I'm his only competition and the only woman animal dealer in the Congo. So when it looked like the show was gonna fold up I decided to take a gamble with your father. I scraped up all the money I could borrow. The idea of a giant gorilla intrigued me. If it proved true it could be the greatest attraction since PT Barnum's days. We first heard of the giant ape two?. No maybe it was three years ago. Father was on safari and he found this native half dead in a canoe wedged amongst some trees. He was from a tribe unknown to this area and spoke in a different tongue. He tried to help him but it was too late. However, he told father this story of a legendary ape god and the lost tribe that worshiped him. - Is that all? - No. From what the native described, father made a sketchy map and looking on our own maps we determined the general area. But it's a place where no white man has ever travelled before. - Do you have the map? - No, I have a copy. Father took the original with him. He always did when he went on safari in hopes that someone in the outlying reserves might know of the area and be able to tell him something about it. And another thing. The native wore a gold medallion in the shape of this ape god that he spoke about. Mr Remington, Miss Adams, come quick, there's a big fire in the animal cage! - I'm sorry Miss Adams, but?. - We got the fire out. Kept it from spreading to the other buildings. Suppose Morgan will have his own way now. The sale of that animal was the last chance I had of paying off my father's note. The fire's destroyed that. - No insurance? - None. - Miss Adams does not wish to see you. - Get outta my way, boy! Okay, George. You didn't waste much time getting here, did you? Well you know how it is, news travels fast in the jungle. I didn't know you had company. Mark Remington. Dan Morgan. Now what can I do for you? Well you know. When I heard that my competition went up in flames, I thought, you know, the only neighbourly thing to do is to stop over here and offer you my condolences. I suppose that's all you came for? Well no, as a matter of fact, due to these new set of circumstances I figured maybe you're ready to talk a little business now. For the last time Morgan, I'm not selling. Oh wise up, will ya? You're finished. - Who says she's finished? - I say so! She shoulda taken the first deal I offered her. She seems to be doing alright on her own. That's beginner's luck. Now listen, April this is your last chance. I'm offering you twice what this compound is worth. - Now take it or leave it. - That's easy. I'll leave it. OK, OK But remember. You're forcing me to go to the Commissioner and attach this compound. Unless of course you wanna come up with the money you owe me right now. You know I don't have it. You could always go out and try to find that lost treasure your old man kept yapping about. Maybe we will, Morgan. How much does she owe you? - That's none of your business. - How much, April? Six thousand dollars. Here's a cashier's check for $5,000 and $1,000 in cash. But Mark I can't accept that. You better keep outta this, mister. Take it, April Consider it a downpayment. We might just go and find that lost city. Haha! Don't tell me you're that dumb. That stupid old man of hers didn't even have a map. I don't care what you believe! Here's the money, now give me my father's note and get off my property. OK, lady Happy hunting. I don't know why you did that but thanks I'll pay you back somehow. You weren't serious when you said you wanted to go after that lost treasure were you? Yes I was. Capturing that giant gorilla means as much to me as saving this compound does to you. Look April, I took a big gamble. I've gotta go all the way. If I don't come up with a big jackpot that $6,000 wouldn't begin to bail me out. Going into the interior's a very different kind of risk. Are you sure you know what you're letting yourself in for? I've got a pretty good idea April, you've got the native boys and you've got the equipment. And I've got the money that we need. Now what do you say? I say it's a deal When would you like to start? First thing in the morning. George, did you tell Mr Remington we're ready to leave? Yes, Miss Adams, he's coming. - Morning! - Good morning Mr Remington. Is this all there is? I thought we were going on safari. We are going on safari. Our bearer's at the river outpost. I need my boys here to run the compound. - Are you ready to leave, Mark? - All set. An early start. We should have been on the road to the river outpost an hour ago. And one more thing. On safari we do everything ourselves. Forget I'm a woman, I can take care of myself. OK George, you'd better go and get the boys. How long do you think it's going to take you? Not very long, Miss Adams, I'll be right back. On your father's map this road doesn't continue much further. No, it doesn't I think the river outpost is... Well it's just about the end of things here. Where is the end of the road? Well that depends on the last safari that came into the region. And there haven't been many. The road is... I guess it's overgrown by now. In other words we go as far as we can with the Rover. And then we abandon it, huh? Yeah, I'm afraid so. These are the only two that'll go, Miss Adams. The rest are afraid. - Of what? - Of the green hell. They also want double wages. I told them I'd talk to you about it. Alright. Tell them they'll have to do twice the work, though. It's a deal. End of the road. Yeah, we'll have to start walking from here. We'd better hurry, there's not much daylight left. Well let's unload the truck and move out. What's the matter, George? Why have they stopped? - Taboo. They won't cross that river. - What? We hired them to go all the way, taboo or not. At the outpost taboo was far away, but now they are afraid. You're the boss, George Tell them to go on. Offer 'em more money if necessary. It's no good. It'll be dark soon. Alright. Make camp here by the river tonight. Talk to them, see if you can change their minds by tomorrow. Good. Tomorrow when the sun is up they may be less afraid. They can't quit on us now. - More coffee? - No thank you, George. I think our fun's just about to begin. This doesn't show any jungle trails at all once you cross the river. My father had been here. Well, he must have left some kind of trail. A trail! That jungle would grow over a highway if it'd not been used for six months. Listen! Where are they coming from George? The river outpost They're telling of our safari. It's just jungle gossip. They say another safari stopped at the outpost yesterday. - It's coming this way. - George. The other safari: white hunters. Oh my god, it must be Morgan. Well I guess he believed you after all. The treasure. He wants us to lead him to it! We've got a two day jump, maybe we can lose him Morgan has a good tracker. Drum say more white men come. They come for treasure, like old white man. Your friend. This time they feel wrath of Gorga! Oh, mighty Gorga! Distant jungle drums tell of approaching evil. Many white men come to violate sacred cavern of the dead. Oh, mighty Gorga! Great god of the jungle! Protector of our village. We prepare an offering to you. Return to the jungle, oh mighty Gorga. We summon you when the moon is full. We make ready sacrifice of young maiden for the altar of life. We're gonna have to move fast tomorrow. Yes George, tell the boys to go and get some sleep. We'll have to start before dawn. Yes, Miss Adams Morgan worries me. And me. Everyone on this trip is after something. You want to capture the giant ape and Morgan wants the treasure, and me, well?. I need your money to pay off Morgan. Is that your only reason? No. My father. I'm sure he's still alive. And the deeper we get into the jungle the more I'm sure of it. We may find him. It's the thing I hope for most on this safari. We're supposed to be getting some sleep Mark? I want you to know that I had some wrong ideas about you. But they've changed now. Forget it. I had some wrong ones about you back at the compound. It takes time to know someone, doesn't it? I mean really know them. Well, I suppose it does. I don't know how to say this... Well, I'm not too good with men. What I mean is, I've never known any really. Except Morgan and Father. And you're so different. Well I sort of trust you. Well this is uh?. This is gonna be a long trip. I wouldn't wanna have to work at getting along with each other I think all the work's been taken out of it. Silence! It is an honour to be chosen as a bride to the great god Gorga! It is through this sacred marriage that our village is protected from the wrath of Gorga. Do not bring dishonour to your family! Do not bring a curse upon this village! Start the ceremony! Wake up! Mr Remington, wake up! What's the matter? The boys ran away last night. They took the equipment and provisions with them. We must hurry if we wanna catch them. No, no. But we have to catch them, we can't go on without our equipment. We've no choice. We could search for days and never find them. We'll just have to make the best of it. But we can't go on alone just the three of us, I mean we? I imagine your father must have faced the same situation, but he went on. Are you really ready to give up this soon? No. Good. - There is a way. - What's that? We make this our base camp George can wait here. No I can't stay. I'll go. No, George. You'll be our only contact with the outside world. If we don't come back you can go for help. If we're careful there should be enough stuff in my tent for the first few days. We'll divide it up in three packs. You're throwing your life away if you go alone. I'm not throwing my life away, George. We'll cross the river, we'll journey in for two days. And then come back. We'll keep on doing that until we've covered the whole area. Or until the rains come. OK. I'll get meat and food from the jungle. We'll have provisions here for you when you get back. And what about Morgan? If he comes this way he'll find our campsite Morgan won't find a thing, I'll hide your trail and break camp. He'll go off in the other direction. George, I should have you in the States to hide my circus from the sheriff. I'll see what I've got in here. Two days in and two days back See ya in four days, George. You shouldn't go. You won't come back. Don't be an idiot, George Nothing's going to happen to us. Keep a coffee on. We'll see you. Four days Then I go for help. Well, let's try that way. April! J.A.! My father's initials! He must be alive! The right trail. April?. Don't get your hopes too high. He didn't mark that tree yesterday. I know, but it's the first sign I've had of him for six months. According to the map we keep going that way. We should come to a man-made landmark Sort of a?. What's it supposed to be? I don't know. But if it's on Father's map, it must be out there somewhere. One way to find out. Come on. Oh, mighty Gorga! I know that your thirst for the blood of young maidens is great. But I pray you, leave our village in peace. Soon?. Soon the invaders will be upon our plateau and you can destroy them! And then, once again. I will summon you to our altar of life. And you can once again drink of the blood of the maiden. Mark, it looks like a dead end. There's still a trail indicated on the map. That must be it, winding along the face of the cliff, see? You're kidding. A mountain goat couldn't even make that. I won't argue with that, but it's the only way up. That was close. Can we take a breather, Mark? I'll be right in a minute. I could use it, I think I'm getting a little old for this. - It's quite a climb, isn't it? - The air's getting thin. I guess that's the price you pay for the view. Mark, I just thought of something. If Dad came this way and slipped like I did just now he had no one to help him. Don't imagine things It's not too far to the summit. I think we should rest a couple of minutes and then keep going. This isn't my idea of a place to spend the night. OK, I'll try. Oh, mighty Gorga! White men from outside world are on our plateau! They come, as have others, to take what is not theirs. They come to steal from the cavern of the dead. Seek them, find them, destroy them! Where are we? I don't know Some kind of a plateau. Mark, look at these flowers. I've never seen anything like this growing in the basin. Hey, what kind of trees are those? They're not trees at all Some kind of giant mushrooms. Mushrooms? This whole plateau is overgrown with?. I don't know it almost looks?. Prehistoric. But it's so beautiful. It may be beautiful, but don't forget those noises last night. Hang onto this. Let's take look around. And stay close to me. I was going to anyway. April, it could be too much to hope for. That feeling you had about your father?. Look! It is! It's Father's knife! It hasn't rusted at all. It hasn't been lying there too long. He must be here! My father must be somewhere on this plateau. I hope you're right, you don't know how much I do. Just take it easy. We're still a couple of outsiders in some kind of a green hell. There's a lot of groundwork to cover. Look around you, honey This whole area's out of a lost age. Suppose years ago it was part of the jungle below. Then nature played some sort of a monstrous practical joke. I don't know. Maybe the Earth's volcanic eruptions forced this whole area upwards. - Trapping it's inhabitants. - You mean like the mammoths in Siberia? Exactly! And I thought it was so beautiful. Just keep your eyes open. Look at this. A human skull. Oh Mark, it's not my... No, of course not! It's Indian. Or some sort of ancient man. Whatever it is it's been here a long time. Look over there, it's some kind of nest. - Let's get a look at those eggs. - Oh no Mark, I'm scared. It's too dangerous, there might be something in there I wanna see them! Anything that can lay a purple egg has to?. These eggs are warm. - Watch out for mother. - Mark, let's get out of here. Get behind me! - Get outta here! I'm gonna hold it off. - No! Just run for it, don't worry about me, there's nothing you can do! Go on! That was close, wasn't it Mark, what was that thing? Don't ask me. When I stumble a few million miles into the wrong time zone I tend to get a little confused. I've seen gorillas, but never anything like this. That's him. That's no legend, that is him. - But Mark, what are you going to do? - That's a pentathol cartridge. It should be potent enough to knock him unconscious for half a day. - Are you alright, Mark? - Of course I'm alright. You scared me half to death, why didn't you shoot sooner? The gun jammed. I can't believe this thing's real. Now my problem begins. How am I going to get that hulk back to civilisation? Oh Mark, look at his finger, he's got a big splinter in it. That's why he had it in his mouth. I'm going to take it out. Hang on to this for me. I bet you always wanted to be a nurse. - Poor thing, he's bleeding. - Oh, here. Tie it with this. Finished. I don't think that pentathol's gonna keep him under I think we'd better get outta here. We're friends. Strangers. We come?. Wait. Let me try. They don't or they won't understand me. I can understand a little of what they're saying. They want to take us to their chief. What are they planning to do? Why didn't they just kill us in the jungle? Instead of bringing us here. It's all part of their ritual, I suppose. The inyanga ? I mean the witchdoctor should be here shortly to see us. Oh? They said something as they threw us in here. About the old one that speaks with two tongues. Two tongues? This doctor must be a pretty big man around here, huh? Yeah he certainly is. He'll be the one who's deciding our fate. If we could take him prisoner, maybe there might be some way out of here. There's someone coming. - Hey! - Take it easy. Stop, stop! It's... Father! - April! - Father, thank god, you're still alive! - How did you get here? - With Mark. Mark Remington. We found your trail. - Remington? You're the circus fellow? - Yes. Well now don't tell me that?. Yes, Father. We found the giant ape and? are you sure you're alright? Oh yes, I'm alright. I was captured on my second day of exploring the plateau. The chief's favourite wife had malaria. And lucky for me I had some quinine tablets in the medicine kit. I have a bodyguard called Kabula who doesn't let me out of his sight. Isn't there some way to escape? Well, I've been thinking about a plan ever since I've been here. But that would take time and that's something you don't have. Well, we've gotta do something. What is your plan? Well, in trying to help Kabula with his English. I learned that he knows of a passageway near here. That leads direct to the base of this plateau. All underground. And as near as I can figure out this passageway is a natural volcanic chimney. You mean a live volcano? No, it's extinct, but it leads to the ancient burial grounds. And it contains the treasures of King Solomon. Well, at least the dead Indians can't stop us. No, but Kabula says it's guarded by evil spirits. After what we've come against so far that doesn't seem like much of an obstacle. I think we should make a break for it the first chance we get. You may not get a chance. The Indians are pretty worked up about your being captured. We've gotta find the entrance to that passageway. Kabula's our only answer. And when they come for you, I'll remain. And after a minute or so I'll sneak out and see if I can find you. They're coming. - Keep going! - Where's Kabula? He'll be hot on our trail, come on. Kabula, take us to the passage. Kabula know. Kabula no tell. Then you will die a slow death. Kabula die, you no find passage. - You leave me no choice, Kabula. - Kabula! He talk to the giant gorilla. He cut you up and feed you to him. No! No, wait. Kabula show you. There Chamber of death. Well don't stop now, you've been in there before. Kabula no go. Taboo. - They're coming! - Come on, Kabula. Enter, white man. You seek treasures, but not live. - You die. - You first. So this is what the Indians fear? This chamber of death. Come, there is more. - And what of the treasure? - Come. Come. See? Dead man. There must be a fortune here. Gold! Rubies, pearls! Beautiful. Worth millions! Take what what you can carry Don't weigh yourself down. You break taboo, you die! Kabula! Stop him! Mark! Mark, wake up, are you alright? Yeah, help me get up on my feet. Did you stop Kabula? No, Father went after him. I'm afraid we're sealed in here. You mean, there's no other way out? Well if there is, we'll find it. Easy. Kabula was wrong. We're not the first outsiders to be in here. Draft's getting stronger There's gotta be an opening ahead. - You've been saying that for hours. - Shh! What's that? Get back! - Run for it. - Too late! Mark, don't shoot! The wall's are shaking! It's the volcano Mark, April! Come here! Look at this. We made it. The jungle. All the natives, all the beasts. Gone. Maybe that's best They don't belong in this world. And the gorilla? I suppose so. We better try to find out way back to the camp and George. Good god, Mr Adams! I thought you were dead George! Look what we found. Alright, hold it! Right there. Well now ain't this a surprise. Running into my old partner right out here in the middle of nowhere. What you want, Morgan? Same thing you do. Get his gun, Brandon. Now I'd like to see that treasure, all of it, right down there. Better do as he says. I want it all, April! - Come on! - Give it to him. Alright, that's it. Get back! What do you think you're doing, stupid? Keep your gun on 'em! Well, you really made quite a haul, didn't ya? You know this is some day, for me. First I find this treasure. And then my old partner disappears. And I wind up with the compound on top of it. You fool Morgan! You've killed George! Anybody else tries something funny they get the same thing. Alright Brandon. Get over there with the rest of ?em! Hey, wait a minute, you and I are partners. I got no partners, now move! Alright, drop that gun. You're next, Remington, I never liked you in the first place. The gorilla! Wait a minute, Morgan, don't shoot! - He must've trailed us somehow. - Yeah. How'd you thank a gorilla for saving your life? I don't know. Maybe he'll settle for his freedom. We could've had the greatest circus attraction the world's ever seen. We? Yeah, that's what I said. We.
