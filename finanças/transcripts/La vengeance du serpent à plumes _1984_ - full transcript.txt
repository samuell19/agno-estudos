Before you is the feathered serpent, God of healing and knowledge of the Mayas. He extended his power from Chichen-Itza throughout Mexico. The only God who resisted human sacrifice, the feathered serpent lost the battle, along with the pacifists, to the adherents of violence. And then the feathered serpent took revenge, and violence was spead... to the people, their cities, their culture... Revenge of the Feathered Serpent - Hi, Lulu. How are you? - Fine, ducky. Slimy as always! You gettin' any? Ugly ones, yes. Off you go, be carefull. Next! Creep! What are you doing? That's my wife! Congratulations. She has a beautiful ass. Fuckin' asshole. Idiot! That's right, now I'll show you. Wait, in line, like everyone else. Fuckin' asshole. Hello. Hello? Damn, I can't hear anything. Yes, Madame Dupin, Rue de La Chausse d'Antin, that's my grandmother. I'm sorry, monsieur, she passed away. It's all the same to me! You know, actually that's good news. Very nice news! How long will we wait? It's freezing here! Shut up! My grandmother died. - Can you come to Paris? - Yes. I'm coming right now. The plane from Mexico City has landed. - And Paco? - He's back there. He's coming. Here he is. Run! Let's go! Excuse me, can you give me a light? Cops? Yes. How many? One, two, five, a dozen, twenty six. They are everywhere. There are at least 30 of them. ...and he sits in my car somehow, a bourgeois in the quarter of La Muet. They always live in luxury neighborhoods you know... And he says, "to Orly." And I'm telling myself "That's great! At least one is leaving!" You have a very nice taxi! - Interior decoration is my hobby. - Really? I've done the same with my house on Alouette street Tropical Style. Yes, Belleville is the real tropics. - Exactly! Is it zebra skin? Imitation. Zebra is prohibited. Ecologists say it leads to the extinction of the species. Oh, yes! - Are you a musician? - No. Musicians are the only rich people who like drinking! I'm not a musician, I'm a cable car operator. Then what's with that trumpet? It's not a trumpet, it's a saxophone. I play on the nerves of the neighbors. "The terrorist Paco is finally arrested" The Anarchist group "Ravachol-Kropotkin"‚ requests... ... immediate release of the terrorist‚ and assumes responsibility for the explosion at the editorial office of "Le Globe". Personally, I would have all these black asses behind bars. Yes, but cops are bastards. They arrest them only cause they have nasty looking faces. And then they let them go because they have oil. Concierge! Last minute news: Witnesses have reported... ...about two motorcyclists, whose faces were hidden and who were seen near the editorial office of "Le Globe" a few moments before the explosion. What's the matter? I'm Louis Dupin‚ the owner. In mean, Madame Dupin, was my grandmother. Wait a second, I'll turn off the TV. The block was blown up again. Well, think about it. All these things happening, prices increase, the violence, the attacks... - Have you been raped? - Twice. - By the same one? - No. Now I don’t dye my hair and wear jeans like a cowboy from the wild west. Last time six men couldn't get the rapists off me. - Were you so strong? - Enough. So, the car squeezes out 200 kilometers. I leave you the counter, the zebra skin and all the rest. As soon as I sell the apartment, I'll let you know. Goodbye and take care. Thanks, thank you. Don't try it Mister Dupin‚ it doesn't work. Damn it. Do you have the keys to the fifth? Madame Duren's keys? No, the girls have them. What girls? Did everything go well? Did you break anything? You want us to get him out of jail or not? Laura! Did you use all the grenades? Why, you don't have enough? Here, catch! Are you crazy? - Did everything go well? - Maybe you should listen to the radio The radio depresses me. It only broadcasts bad news. I don't understand, does someone live in the apartment? Two very decent students. They went shopping for your grandmother. They paid her rent and it was a good help for her pension. You will come to an understanding. We will indeed. I'm moving in, they're moving out. That's what I feel like doing. I hope they are at home. They looked after your grandmother. Madame Dupin had fun with all this young people... Irish, Corsicans, Basque‚ German, Japanese. After leaving her work in the toilets at the Opera Square, she was lonely. - Is this it? - Yes. Open up, I'm the landlord. Damn it! - But ... - Wait here. Laura! Hide! Will you open or not? Yes‚ I'm coming, I'm coming. Hi Valerie! You took your time to open... Hello, Madame Lepuatvin. How are you? Good. Well, I 'm leaving. Right. Thanks. I haven't been here in 20 years. My mother and grandmother hated each other. Mother worked as a manicurist. And granny was a cleaner at the Opera Square. She would be more satisfied if her son had married the Opera type than... Not like that. Then my mother got upset. "My dear Georgette, aren't you disgusted ripping out dead flesh all day?" "And you, mommy, aren't you disgusted with the odours from the toilets? " They told each other some nasty things and never saw each other again! That was close! This is damn dangerous. So, do you have any beer? Yes, offcourse. In the refrigerator. - And what are you doing for a living? - I write reviews in "Objective 32". - What exactly? - Movie reviews. Really? And your "objective" is to become a lecturer? Sometime I 'll tell you about objectives. You will be surprised. We won't bother you, we won't make noise, we will not have any guests. Don't worry, you won't bother me, since you and your friend will move out. It will be easier. I intend to host lots of guests. I also like to go naked and play the saxophone. But I don't live with girls that I fuck. I'm just not suited for this. Is there anything to eat? Look, it's a quarter past five. Mine's running ahead. You asshole! Son of a bitch! Enough, I can't do this anymore! I'm sure it's another woman! You disgust me! I don't want to see you anymore, lecher! You lied to me! You always lied to me! Traitor! I can easily find a guy much better than you! - It's her fiance. - What does she say to him? That she will easily find a better guy. She's right. No, too late. - Can't we agree? - Everything is over! Well, we could, in general, we could agree. Yes. Who's he? The owner of the apartment. Mr. Dupin. Hey. Piacere! Tano! Not here and not today. Here you go, beauty! Alvaro! Well I'll be damned! Lulu! What happend to you, asshole? I got no news from you. - I was ok. - How is it going? Good. I inherited an apartment, and I will fuck the most beautiful girl in the world! Cut the crap. No, I'm telling you the truth, here, check it yourself. I stole this, it's from her vacation in Mexico. Wow, cool girl. Well, you're fine aren't you? - Well, it's not yet sure... - Cut the crap! I'm telling you, it's progressing! Remember "What you can't touch is just a dream"! Lucien, give me a banana, I didn't have breakfast. - Thanks. - Here, dear. Your monkey isn't impoving, he hasn't learned French yet. On the contrary! After Maggie left, I tought him to make coffee and wash dishes. With Maggie, is it really over? After I left the circus ... and slept with that trapeze artist we couldn't... Alix! Hombre! It can't be! Alix Lefebure from Bank Lefebure. From Bank Lefebure. How are you, Alix? How are you? Amico. My friend! Remember Buenos Aires? Do you remember Ricardo de Lariaga? The country house and the boat on Rio de la Plata? Ricardo de Lariaga? The night with the whores in Caracas? Do you remember the night with the whores? Do I remember the whores in Caracas? I remember very well! - A game of polo? - A game of polo. Vamos! Let's go. Valium. - Enough, he will be out. - That's what we want! - There is no light. - Wait, I'll check the counter. I can't see a thing. It's a disaster! The Japanese will freak out for the second time! Everybody listen, here is Laura. Meet my friends. Our small band "Flat Plates". We haven't played for 10 years. You can hear it. - Good evening. - Hello. Come, I'll introduce you. Here is Fredo‚ swimming coach in Deliny... and Regina... this is Laura. This is Maggie, Alvaro's wife. - Ex wife. - Ah yes. Shall we dance? This is Jacqui. She's not a singer, she's a taxi driver! - Hi. - This is Laura. - I bought her car. - He made a great deal. I paid her on credit. Laura‚ this is Alvaro‚ my best friend. - Hello! ... Good evening And Lucien, his best friend. I am Basilio. Laura's brother. Meet my brother Basilio. Is he Lulu? Yes, he is Lulu. Lulu, do you mind if he stays here for as few days? I object. It will embarrass me. yes, it will bother me. It's impossible for a Sicilian girl to sleep in the same house with a man. What did he say? You understood me eh? He's jealous. Go away, Basilio‚ get out! Oh well, tell him to stay! Thank you Lulu‚ thank you! It's so stuffy in here! Lefebure is not in the basket! - Really? - Heck! This can't be. To all patrol cars! Alix Lefebure, the banker's son, was kidnapped today at the Bagatelle Sports Club. Description: 30 years old, height 1,72 m. Brown eyes, straight nose, mustache. Night patrol here. Youngsters having fun? Will have to intervene again. Okay, we're on our way. Ninth Arrondissement Rue de la Chausse d'Antin. I... went boom ... and bam. Ok, upstairs. He's drunk as a skunk. Seduced and Abandoned. A jealousy ridden drama. Be careful, he's watches her like a dog. This soon to be "girlfriend" of yours has a friend? ... Vaderie, yes. You can have a try if you like. She's a movie freak. Mostly on boring films though. If you've seen "La grande vadrouille" don't tell her about it. Once we split, that's that, and we can't speak anymore? Get out, Maggie‚ really can't you see I'm busy? No, but... They have fun here! Two, there are two of them. - We brought back your friend. - He is drunk. There were complaints from neighbors. Lower your music a bit. It's almost midnight. We're going to stop now. Go mister, back to your friends. Thank you. Goodbye. - Goodbye ladies & gentlemen. Goodnight. Lulu. I want to be alone with you. Ask everyone to leave please. Yes, of course. Hey, everybody stop! Thank you, everyone out now. Friends, friends of friends, the "Flat Plates". Thank you for coming... and going. I want to be alone with my girlfriend. Well, if so, then bye, Lulu. Bye, friends, bye. Ciao. Ciao, girls. Bye guys. Bye, my children, bye! Have you seen Bresson's last film? Listen, now is not the time to pester me. Bye, Lulu. Cow! I worked as a hairdresser's assistant. An errand boy, a waiter in a cafe. I even worked at a zoo. As a guard, not an animal. Selling oysters. When in season of course, not all year long. What else did I do? I poisoned rats. It was a full time job. I also worked as a bath attendant and then a cable car operator. I did all this to make a living. Now I want to be a taxi driver because I like it. Is the taxi your dream? Yes, if I could have my own car. It's not like your dream - to defend widows and orphans. I'm not studying to defend widows and orphans. - To defend killers then? - Yes! Don't you think, that killers also need to be defended? The main thing is to stop them getting out of prison. "Romain" for monsieur, "Napolitain" for mademoiselle. - You are a "Napolitain" too eh? No, I was born in Sicily. Sicily, mafia, revenge, dad, mom. Too much violence. Leaving was the right thing to do. Violence is everywhere. In all countries many young people believe ... that it's necessary to respond to violence with violence. And what do you think? I'm lucky. I served in the army after the war in Algeria. Can you imagine me fighting for a French Algeria? And now France has become quite Algerian! Mind you, even though I say this, I'm not a racist! My best friend is Portuguese. He's something like a Jew but not a Jew, poor fellow. Don't you eat? No, I have a small headache. I'll be right back. Would you like a rose? - Here, this is for you. - Thank you. You know, it's good that your friend stayed at home. Usually the ugly ones never suffer from migraines. You date me to make that guy jealous. Revenge works. But you should choose the right instrument for revenge. The guy who makes the other ones jealous ... We take revenge because we continue to love. It doesn't make sense otherwise. On the contrary... ...revenge is always good, even if you don't think so. But for revenge to succeed you have to choose someone unusual. For example, your Carlo, is he handsome? Yes. - Choose an ugly one! Is he thin? - Yes - Choose a fat one. - He's too smart. - That depends. I may look dumb but I'm not. After all, I have hidden tallents. But since they're hidden, I can't show them. - I'll do it myself. - Thank you. And... Bombs away! It's a good one! It's your house. A fire in the fireplace. - My house? - Yes, go! What happened? Do you live on the fifth floor? Did you start a fire? Yes it was getting cold and I started a fire. In a fireplace that hadn't been used for 15 years! Sign here. Okay. Is there any damage? Clean the chimney at once, otherwise there will be another fire. If you don't like fires, change your profession! Because there will always be fires. Thank you, monsieur. What happened? That studip asshole lit a fire in the bedroom. With our toys the whole block could take off into the sky. Where is he? He's coming up. - Do you live on the fifth floor? - Yes. - Have you found them? - Found what? - The golden coins. - What? Your grandmother bought them. There should be 300 pieces in total. Did she say where she hid the coins? She didn't tell anyone, but ... they should be in the apartment. The proclamation. The fuckin' text! The explosion at the Lefebure Bank is the second warning, which we give to the French government, responsible for the arrest of our comrade Paco. Laura‚ quick, he's here! Paco committed only one crime - he fought for a just world. This was a message from the anarchist group "Ravashol-Kropotkin". Valerie, is the migraine gone? No, I put some ice on my head. Lulu‚ I took Valium and I want you to let me sleep. Goodnight, Lulu. Good night. Good night. He left. Laura... I want to tell you that ... I don't want you to think that ... In general, that you and me ... I wanted to tell you that I had a lovely evening. And even if there aren't gona be other evenings, I would still remember this. What a nerd! Obviously if there will be others‚ I would be happy ... Well... - Laura? - Yes? Do you know about the Napoleons? What Napoleons? Golden coins. My grandmother hid them here. Did she say anything to you before dying? Do you know where she hid them? No, but I'll look. He will search! Goodnight! I'll go to him. It's so cold in here... What a mess... everything smashed up. It's unlikely that they're here. Lulu? Here, put this on, you're gonna catch a cold. Look, the firemen destroyed all the windows. Did you find anything? Yes, I found something. Well, he's a handsome guy. tanned, athletic, full of energy. Give it to me. I'm at a disadvantage... I don't give a damn about him! I already told you, it's over with this guy. Okay. What's there? Granny wasn't only working as a cleaner in the toilets. Or she took work home. Here is fresh milk, from my Blanche's udders. Isn't that right, Aurelien? That's right, Marie. Look how beautiful he will be in the photograph wich we'll send to daddy! Have a drink, my boy. If my daddy gives you 100 million, will you let me go? You can't get far, my boy. We are 40 kilometers away from any living soul. Our Lefebure looks better than ever. Because we treat Lefebure well. Hold this tight. Today's date on the newspaper should be visible. Don't smile. You must look unhappy. Take it to the papers Hurry! A nightmare. As if this is not my home. A real domestic drama. Her brother Basilio sleeps at his sister's door. And when he can't he sends one of his friends. For three days he hasn't left the apartment and eats cous-cous every morning, afternoon and evening. Strange for an Italian. Does he know you fucked her? Are you crazy? He would have cut my throat. You want my advise? Send him away! If I send the brother away then I must say goodbye to his sister. ... you undesrtand eh? Of course, I see. I'll tell you what, you are "perrepa". This is Portuguese. This is who you are. Perrepa. I have the impression that what you're telling me is not nice. It means idiot, sucker. And you'll never dissuade me that something is wrong here. This girl is too pretty to fall in love with you. That's nice, pal. But Lulu‚ you asked me to speak frankly. Yes, this will be a lesson for you then. You have lost a friend, that's all. Oh no. Lucien! Lucien! Lucien! This way, Lucien! Lucien! Is that you, Laura? I'm coming You know... I thought about you. You have no idea. I've been waiting for this three days now. I've talked to my friends about you... you understand ... ...but they didn't believe me. And when they saw you, they were surprised. But I was discreet and didn't tell them that we ... I swear. I just told them about you. About your eyes... ...and your little nose... ...your mouth. But then your brother appeared. Well, no, thanks, brother. I don't get your "Piace pa pa parlare..."! I'll help him. You will see how I will help him. That idiot scared me. How he scares me! I 've never seen a guy that at the same time looks both cruel and dumb. He hasn't suspected anything. He didn't understand a thing and I disagree! Paco's order. You do what he says. You kill him and you don't make a scene. Basilio‚ are you there? I know you are there! What the hell are you doing? Step back, Lucien! Damn. Wait. It's a song. Chicken rock. You like it? Enough! The nonsense is over. I want to tell you, I'm sleeping with your sister. I've slept with her and I intend to sleep again with her! Asshole! Bastard! Fat lecher! Exactly. But I will be generous with you. Laura and I we'll move to a hotel but tomorrow I'll be back and I will live here... ...and you with your basket and your cous-cous will go back to Palermo. Nobody uses that tone with Aurelien! And you're not gonna be the one that does, asshole! Damn! Come on. Let's go. Here I am. I'm so glad. Have you seen him? Let's go. Hello! Monsieur? I heard you have a room for 35,000 per day... or per night. Of course but we also have a lot cheaper. Don't judge by my clothes. I'm nouveau-rich. This is gold. The "Thousand and One Nights" suite is free. 34,000 francs, without service, of course. Private pool, video, fax, three bilingual secretaries, Rolls-Royce with or without driver. The blue or the white? The white. It's more refined. Thank you. Antoine, the "Thousand and One Nights" suite for the gentleman. Listen, for 34.000 can we get breakfast? No monsieur, food is extra. - Silly me! - Hey, taxi driver, you can't stay here! You're very kind but If you want to say something to me, send a fax. Come on, Lucien. Do you think this will last long? Do you think we will continue to endure your whims? You poor bastard! Lulu‚ are you coming? Just a second, I'm coming. Help me. Help me for god's shake! - Would you like champagne? - Yes. Don't be an asshole, damn it! Alain Delon thinks the other one is playing, but he will drown him. I've seen this movie. It's not so hard to drown a person. Yes. Especially if he's drunk. Or can't swim. Me, for example, I can't swim. Take off your clothes, I'll teach you. Go on. Yes, but ... ...you are Jane. He is Chita, but I'm not Tarzan‚ I'm Lulu. And as a child, Lulu rarely went on vacation. And where he lived there were no pools. You do understand I hope. Don't play the fool. I thought I was fat and didn't dare to undress in front of girls. But now I'm thinner. I mean, I went on a diet since I met you. And being on a diet is hard when there aren't lots of things to eat. Damn, look what he does to him! He drowned him. Perfect crime. There is no perfect crime. In the end you always get cought. Not at all! And then, remorse is a lie! They want to assure the killers that they will be depressed if and when they are arrested. In fact, depression comes only when they get arrested. And here's what I will say. All the better! If anyone hurt you, then I'll kill him at once. And without remorse. Cheers! You remind me of my father. He was an old fascist and you are young one. He was also a rich fascist and you, despite the inheritance, you will always be a fascist taxi driver. Do you love your father? Yes, I loved him as a child. We had a house, by the sea, near Rome. And one day, in the villa, I found a photo of Duce. There was my father. Young, handsome. In a black shirt and with a raised hand. I didn't knew what it meant. - But then I realized. - Yes. Are your parents alive? Yes. They are in Switzerland. Like all the rich they try to avoid taxes. Or maybe the Red Brigades, because in Italy ... - Why are we talking about this? - I don't know. It's damn boring. Laura‚ why are you here? Why with me? And why you stay silent‚ when I say stupid things? Which stupid things? You're telling a lot of nonsense you know. Nonsense. For example, when I say that we could live together or that... you don't answer. You don't say yes or no. Must I always decide something? Must I obey to someone? Run on the strrets, execute someone's directives! Do this, do that. How exhausting! Let me breathe! Live calmly, eat, drink, swim! Give me at least a few minutes without talking about life and death. But I'm not talking about this, Laura. I'm only talking about love. Then... Pour me a little champagne. And talk to me about love. Monsieur Gaston Lefebure, father of Alix‚ one of the most prominent bankers and shipowners of our country shakes hands with the police prefect and Commissioner Goreto. Let me remind you that Alix Lefebure will not be exchanged with Paco immediatetly. He will have to accompany the latter to an unknown location and he will be released later. However, Gaston Lefebure demanded to see that his son is alive before Paco is released. Your Highness. Laura? It's you? Laura? Laura! Oh, you're here. Laura left. Yes, ducky. Yes. It's strange, wherever I go something explodes. - Get Paco out! - Goreto! Alix! Are you okay? Yes, daddy. I'm ok. Bring out Paco‚ otherwise ... Let Paco come! Alone! Bastard, I'll catch you someday. Here in Roissy everything happens so quickly. "Ravachol-Kropotkin" has just arrived in a white Rolls-Royce. For the first time anarchists use such an expensive car. The kidnappers stopped the car near the plane. Police and journalists are watching. Here they are! Two of them push Alix to the stairway. The rest get on the plane. Everything happens quickly. There it is! They are on the plane. Τhe door closes. And the plane starts to take off. That's it. They have left. She says she's studying, and she's a terrorist. She says she's Sicilian‚ and she was born in Rome. You think she's a virgin and she is a whore! We are looking for her in Mexico, and she could be in the Middle East. Except the Paris metro map, can you read from a real map? Can you find Chichen-Itza? Third intersection after the red light to the left. Anyway, Chichen-Itza is bullshit. Wow! A fictional thing with fake photos and fake pyramids. A wise man said once "A fool doesn't know..." It's your foolishness which haunts me since we arrived in Mexico, with phrases like "what women really want is..." or like "loose hips sink ships..." etc. etc. I've had it with you Alvaro. You mix everything together. All women are for you or whores or virgins. Do you understand? You don't understand anything. So take it easy and admire the scenery. Traveling is rejuvenating. It's good for you. When you leave France, don't think like a French man. I'm afraid! I'm on the run! Interpol is looking for my monkey. You wanna take revenge on a gang of terrorists, because you fucked a damsel from the Red Brigades. And you're ready for anything just to see her again. Crossing borders with fake passports... ... you risk getting 20 years in jail for aiding in a murder... ... and a kidnaping. Αnd I'm such a fool‚ that I'm following you! Together with this monkey who will give us away at the first inspection. And where could I have left him? The police knows his face! And it's all your fault! Terrorists Lucien! A monkey that didn't bite anyone ever, even another monkey. Just in case his fingerprints were taken. Arms and legs also, right? You know, you're getting old... You have become like and old couple, you and your monkey! Here, take it. Well, don't pout, you're right. I'm a nerd. I didn't say you were a nerd. I said that Laura is a whore. I agree, she's a whore. Satisfied? You and I know several of these whores. Not all of them have ideals. - Your wife, for example. - How do you know? But Laura and all these people capitalism, fascism, racism, they are willing to sacrifice their lives for all that. And yours too! Back to Paris? We return to Paris. And we'll tell the cops everything? And tell everything to the cops. How will we drive the car to Paris if we get drunk? To get to Paris you need to swim across the sea. And that's how! It's a good thing that there's a sea. You shouldn't believe me when I tell you, that I don't care about Laura. You shouldn't believe me... I'm sad that I will not see her again. But since the sea is huge and there's a lot of water in it, I will drow my sadness in alcohol. You're drunk and you won't be able to float. Alvaro‚ don't sleep, don't sleep. Come on. Look. Mommy! - R.. R... Ready? - Yes. - Shall we start? - Yes. Come on! Help me. You corpses, come help me! "Yucatan Archaeological Mission" Go away! And Norbert? He will join us later. Did he say anything about me? No. No, no. Let's go, we're leaving. San Rosario City Prison Lulu! It wasn't you who killed that man. You are not guilty! Of course! Lunch! At last! Why so late? Is everyone on strike in your kitchen? Two days, look. Look what they gave us! Did you see this? What did they give us to eat? We could use Mitterand's journey. We ask for Régis Debray's protection and there we are, political prisoners. - Is Mitterand here? - Sure. And also Reagan. Madame Thatcher‚ Mother Gandhi. There are 23 of them in Cancun. That's what I call grub! Murderer, terrorist your Lulu Dupin is dangerous. Amateur, but they are the most dangerous. They are capable of anything. Shoot the crowd or the president. Just to be known. If he came to Mexico, so Paco is here too. He fell for Paco's propaganda‚ As the others. All fanatics. He'll suspect something's wrong if we let him loose. - I came up with something. - What? Something great. Purely Mexican. Take it easy. Stop pushing! I haven't done anything wrong! Bastards! I'm a foreigner! Go. Come on guys! Everyone remembers what to do? Alvaro‚ look! On the floor! Stop! Thank you. They set us free. Thanks. Long live the Mexican bandits! Thanks. Let's shake hands. Did yous see? We are free! - This is for you. - What? - It's for you. - Well, this is for us! - I won't sit on it! - Come on‚ we are leaving! I eat horse meat‚ but I can't ride! Let's go, we'll find out now. Push him. The monkey! Ride with God, friends. Goodbye my friends. Get up shitheaed! Are you going to sleep here? Everything worked out, the way you wanted commissioner. Thanks sargeant, now get rid of your costumes and return to San Rosario. Yes, sir. Look! Motorcycles! Stop this horse! Come on. Don't look. Come on, come on! Oh no. Are you coming or not? Come on. Hold on tight! My motorcycle! My motorcycle! Thieves! Hold it, mom! Thieves! We hijacked Jesus' motorcycle! I'll get you! You will pay for it! My motorcycle! Wait, my boy! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! OK, let's get out of here. Look. It's Mustafa. Rehearsal is over. Thank you all. Get some rest. I will see you tomorrow. Don't move, I'll be right back. Why did you come to Chichen-Itza? How did you find me? Imagination is the power that society often underestimates. Bakunin! Beware of the crowd clattering arms, waving banners. And also politicians. Live like a slave, die like a slave. Germinal. 1905. Freedom is not bestowed‚ it's conquered. Lenin. Kropotkin! You should have known this. I've been thinking about you since that day. Let's go! Let's go! Get on, get on, get on. Oh shit! I have read books about Mexico. Anarchists, revolution, Karl Marx. I wanted to understand everything. But there's something I don't get. What exactly? Why did you sleep with me? Not the first time - I know about that. But the second time, at the hotel. But you liked it! Offcourse I liked it. I'm even ready if you want to repeat it right here. Idiot! Do you know who you are, Lulu? A small, white, rotten middle class slob. When you eat others are dying of hunger. When you run, others are falling. Have you thought about that? I think about the guy who falls, but not all the time. You only think about eating, sleeping and driving your fuckin' taxi! We are fighting for the hungry versus the well-fed, for the slaves against their oppressors‚ and you are traveling across the ocean to ask me, why did I slept with you! You didn't understand, that sex is not important to us? No, I didn't knew this. I'll tell you. I slept with you for love. For the love of Paco. Isn't your Paco jealous? No. Great, I'm not jealous either! And so we will continue. You can love Paco, but you 'll sleep with me. You disgust me! Shut up and step forward! Laura‚ the feathered snake statue up there.
