For the first degree murder oF Robert Tornim I hereby sentence you to death by hydrogen cyanide gas. For the first degree murder of Kay Frothington I hereby sentence you to death by hydrogen cyanide gas. For the second degree murder of Pearl Gladly, and you got lucky on this one, I hereby sentence you to 80 years. You'll be housed at the state prison until the moment of your last breath. We can only hope that my hunch of your responsibility for more victims than just these three is wrong. - Dr. Sorland. We've been reviewing your case closely. As has most of the country. And I must say it is the most impressive example of rehabilitation I've seen in my career. Perfect conduct record. The phycology degree as well as the degree in general education you've earned while incarcerated. Is nothing short of miraculous. - Thank you sir. - Tell us Charlie what would you do if we were to grant you a conditional parol today? How would you get along out there? You are the first person in California history to survive 50 years while sitting on two executions. - Well I'd continue to do everything I've done in here. There are 100s of men out there functioning as productive members of open society. Men I helped change right behind these walls. I'd aim to make it thousands. - Dr. Sorland we believe that what you've done to not only turn your own life around but that Midas touch you seem to have for correcting troubled men. Probably think you'd be an asset out there by putting your abilities to wider use. What would you say to that? - I'd be greatly honored sirs, ma'am. - Of course this would come with certain provisions. You may very well end up back here again with a loss of all the things you enjoy in here now. Do you under stand? Take a detour on the wrong street without permission, cozy up to the wrong person and that's it. - However we will be releasing monies from the sales of your book to you for the purpose of sustaining your self. So you can give your full attention to the cause. I'm going to suggest that you seek a financial advisor and a new attorney who specializes in well I'll just say it celebrity life styles and situations. No offense Ralph. - No offense, thank you your honor. - We will arrange for some courses for you to transition you to function competently in today's world. - Thank you, thank you. - Do you have any questions for us Charlie? - Not at this time. - Well I have one. Could you sign this Dr. Sorland? This is for a friend of mine down at the youth detention center. Kathy, hello? Hello are you there? I'm here. I just wanted to see her, just one more time to tell her I'm sorry for crashing us that night. I thought I was to tough to tell her I love her. - Yeah we're once again here at Glen Hill's book store in West Hollywood where former death row inmate and recent parolee, Charlie Sorland also known as the Century city killer is today signing copies of his DVD Violence Is Obsolete. - Yeah, yeah. What brings you out here? - Just your DVD and your book, and just everything you do is amazing. - It's a DVD that has become a very powerful tool with law officers and school counselors during the last year or so as they try to curb the aggressive behavior of troubled youth and to reform adult offenders. And now with the release of the DVD Dr. Sorland doing a very different kind of time. Trying to reach an audience that thus far law enforcement sponsored programs have failed to address. Lots of folks out here today including Yolanda Washington. Ms. Washington if I could let me ask you what brought you out here? - Charlie Sorland just has to sing my DVD. I have my son back and I don't mean I got my son back from them. I got my son back, my real son. The one I always knew he could be and I owe it all to Charlie. - So clearly you're okay with Charlies release. - Okay? Okay, his release is the reason why we're gonna have less people killing one another. He's paid his dues. He set out the truth and the truth set him free. We appreciate you talking to us. That certainly seems to be the case during a recent news conference a Los Angeles police department head quarters Captain Harry Theabald assured the public that both he and the states parol board have complete confidence in the effectiveness of Charlie Sorland's anti violence program. A program to which Charlie has now dedicated nearly 50 years of his life. Earlier today we spoke to world renown criminal psychologist Dr. Kaye Ann Williams and this is what the doctor had to say. - And let's not forget the law enforcement community, the phycology community and quite frankly the civil sectors are firmly behind this landmark decision. Charlie Sorland began his own, self imposed rehabilitation the moment he left that court room in 1953. His remorse was well documented the day of sentencing. His dedication and strong history of transforming law breakers into peace makers cannot be disputed. After all isn't that the point of incarceration? To rehabilitate rather than to discard. - So there you have it, the DVD is Violence Is Obsolete. And now the one time Century city killer playing a very different role in West Hollywood, I'm Mike Watkiss. We'll throw it back to you. - What the hell? This old ass man has been killing people for 50 years? - Nah babe, 50 years ago. This guy, get this, this guy killed a bunch of people back in the 1950's or some shit and got busted for it. Then he went to prison, he changed a lot of other people and himself, now he's famous for it. - So what did he do? Go trigger happy or something? - No get this, he made people smell the cologne bottle but it wasn't really cologne in the bottle, it was poison fumes from chloroform. Then when they're knocked the hell out, he stabs them slowly in the heart one time so the blood doesn't spatter everywhere it just kinda gutters out slowly. And then he takes some money and the shirt. - Where you there or something? How do you know all this? He talked about it like a million times. It's what I've heard in interviews. Interesting. - Yo Stitch, Jackie never heard of the Century city killer. - Where have you been? We learned about charming Charlie back at BCC. Actually the news was over at his house he'd been living at since he got out. Think it's the second to last house on Canyon Lake drive before Park Trail. That status looking number. - Yeah whatever. You didn't even finish at BCC's so. - Cause I learned my own chemistry. - Jason why do you kick it with these kids? You're like older than all of them. - I went to this frat party once. - Do you really think the way he pulled those off will work in 2003? Don't think so, they got DNA and everything else now. Wouldn't make it past the first body without getting popped. Yo, you aren't blowing on Stitch's stash are you? - No man I'm not trying to put floor cleaner in here to rot my teeth out. I'm all about the powder. And you got the best man. It's true. - You know somebody could just start killing again in the same style this guy used to and they might think that since he's out he's the one doing it again. - That'd be messed up bro. - Yeah, for real. - Yeah, 100. You uh, really into this serial killer stuff huh? Every time I'm here you up in here watching something about serial killers. - It's just like the guy was stupid, I mean that's why he got caught. I could do it even better. I mean if I did get caught at least I'd sell records out of the deal instead of books. Yo Stitch hook me up with some of that chloroform man. - Chloroform? What the hell man, You can't buy that shit since forever. Besides why buy when you can make? - Make? You know how? - Duh man, it's just some cheap whisky and chlorinated lime mixed just right. It smells good and look like water. Or else you could just try sweet talking her. Instead of trying to knock her out. Take your pick. - Really? - Yeah. ♪ Tell me what you want ♪ - Hey, hey. Do you, one of you know where the after, after, after, after, after party is? ♪ Tell me now what you want ♪ ♪ Want to do to me ♪ ♪ Tell me now let it show ♪ - Another loser. Hey, don't get caught pissing in public dude. - I'm not pissing, I'm nervous. - Good cause last time I did that I got 150 dollar fine. Hey Mia hold up. - What? Allie. Allie. - Why are you being weird? - I'm supposed to meet a girl here tonight. But I don't exactly look like my pictures on the internet. - Oh, you are weird. - Come on Allie, let's go. - No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait. - I'm going to get the car, pull around and you better be ready. I swear that girl. - Listen at least tell me if this cologne smells cheap or not. So the guy was homeless. Wait a second you're just now telling us this a whole day later? Why? - I wanted to see if maybe she went home with him or something, give her time to get back. She does those kinds of things sometimes. - In which case he probably wouldn't be homeless. - No, I mean he could have been, he looked like he might be but he said something to her about meeting a girl. He had a cart of junk, he was really odd. - Did he have anything like a cellphone? - Not that I saw. He did have what looked like a small bottle or something in his hand. Or maybe it was something else. I don't know. I was smashed okay? - It's okay, calm down. So other than the shaved eyebrow, nothing else stood out? Tattoos, facial hair? - It was dark and I wasn't exactly standing next to him. His arms were covered, his face was in the dark mostly. - Okay. You're not going anywhere soon are you? I may need you to come back. Excuse me for one second, I'm sorry. Detective Lowe. On my way, listen I gotta run, we have each other's information. Oh Nina. Yeah what's up? Mia, this is Detective Kline. She'll get more information, finish up for now. - Okay but what about? We'll be in touch. In the mean time, be safe out there. - All right but we gotta get this processed, tell me what you got. - I'll be using this. - Right, good, good, good. Good, so we're done here, I got one over to this side, one over this side, I don't know what else, it's kind of a crazy scene tonight. - I got it. - All right. - Detective Lowe. I found this in a dumpster right over there. - Good job. Thank you again, appreciate. - Okay, sure. - Cassidy, how'd you get here so quick? - Never mind that, here, what do you make of this? - Any ID? - No not yet. - Got a purse. - Well scratch that. - Thanks. Ah hell, Allie Gershwin. - What? You know her? - No but I know who she is. What, what's so funny? - Allie? In an alley? I don't know, sorry. - This very case ended up on my desk today. It was nothing but a missing party girl until now. - Hope you can find that son of a bitch. - Dude last night some chick was found dead right behind my apartment. - Whatever dude. - Seriously. - No I heard something about that to. Some dude stabbed a chick right in her cantaloupes. - Really? - For real? - What a shame. I mean if she was gonna go out she might as well have stop at my place on the way. - Well maybe she stopped by Jason's. Somebody test that girl for chloroform. - What the hell man? - They did say he had green eyes and a chin bush, I'm just saying. - Any day now. - All right Sonya's getting short, let's run this. - Yeah, well those law books are a real inconvenience, it's not like there aren't a half a dozen cameras in the room at those events, already logging my face. - Charlie I know I don't have to say this but when I advocated your release into the program we both knew that there'd be some time required to satisfy them. - Yes, I know. Well here's to my elusive pardon. - Pardon? - I'm an optimist. - Well I'm an optimist to. - But how did you pay for all this? I know you didn't win this much from my boys. I know you didn't win this much money from the boys. But how did this happen? You? But how could you pay for all this? I know you didn't win this much from the boys. - Sir, would you like some cologne? - Man I'm sorry I got, you know I got this to get. - Are you sure, it's really good your * might even like it. - It's really good stuff. - Yeah. - Here you go, check it out. - Here in the Hollywood hills this morning, Hollywood Park found the body of well known celebrity Rodger Harletin missing shirt and ID from the scene yet found close by. Knife wound through the chest cavity with minimal blood spatter. - Yeah, another one. He's going high profile now. He's Rodger Harletin. - Who the hell's Rodger Harletin? - You know that actor from the sitcom about the guy and his pet raccoon. - Oh yeah, that show sucked. - Yeah same style as the Gershwin girl in West Hollywood. And I just got word that there's one or two more just like it, one on Fairfax, the other in Griffith park over the past couple days. I'm not liking this. - Shit. All right call Jack Howard. Get with him tomorrow at the Santa Monica station. He's dealt with every major serial in Los Angeles and Ventura county. Keep this between you and him, we don't want the press to get involved. - Hey while I got ya do you remember the Charlie Sorland murders of 1951 to '53? - Hey watch it, I'm not that old. - No I mean do you know of them? This is really bothering me because if I'm not mistaken the Century city killer murders looked just like this according to case files we've studied. The missing shirt, the ID from the scene yet found easily close by? The knife through the heart with minimal blood spatter? By all accounts a homeless person always around? The only thing that was missing was a bottle of what was it? Ether or something. - Chloroform. I already thought of that. I've also noticed that the press hasn't caught the similarities between him and old Charlie boys methods. Thank goodness for that, no more details outside the department. - Yeah that's the only thing that doesn't add up. - He did have wat looked like a small bottle of something in his hand. - All right well get him over to toxicology and get those samples from the others over there to. - Will do Cassidy, hey you mind if we finish this up on the way. I just thought of something. - Oh, hey, hey, hey. Hey are you still working that undercover homeless meth case? - No, why do you ask? - Cause you look like shit. - You gonna try to get some golf in this weekend? - I'm gonna get some golf in tonight before the storm hits. - Yeah this weather changes fast. - Yeah, all right let's do it. Hey I heard Cassidy's getting ready to retire? Yeah Cassidy is getting ready to retire and Lt. Howard I really appreciate you taking the time to meet with me today. In spite the weather conditions. Yeah no problem. Yeah, good resource for me to talk to about some killings that have been occurring. Oh really? Well okay. - You may have heard of them come across the wire. It's some serious stuff. Very similar mass IMO to some killings that took place back in the 50's from Charlie Sorland. - Charlie Sorland, yeah. - You know the name? - I sure do. - Sargent Cassidy said that you'd be a good person to talk to. - It was a very intelligent man, well studied. He's definitely someone who could really help you guys. I spent a lot of time working with him back then. I wanted to see if you might be able to provide something. Insider information. Yes, I had the opportunity to work with Dr. Sorland on many cases. - Hello, Dr. Sorland? Detective Brent Lowe with L.A.P.D. Hollywood. - Now everyone down there is fully aware I am not to be contacted without accompaniment of my parol councilor. - Yes I apologize but this is an unofficial visit. Off the record. Please? Looks like you're making the best of your release. - Yes well the leash is better than the bars. The warm sunlight through the window is better than the cold blue light on the concrete ceilings of Alcatraz. - I thought you were housed at San Quentin? - No, that's correct. Just looking for a little sympathy. - Dr. Sorland I. - Charlie, Charlie please. - Very well then Charlie, I'm not sure if you're aware but some things have occurred over the past week. Some troubling things. - There was a girl right? Allie Gershwin? Similar to my old modus operandi right? - You read? - Yes and although not every aspect of my old MO was in the news story I assume it was all there by your account which is why you're here. - That's right, all accept for Harletin who's shirt and wallet we couldn't find. I happened to recognize him. Now I'm not saying you know anything but I have to ask. Do you find it curious that for the first time since 1953 four murders this past week have occurred? In the same area, in the same style? - Four? Not just the one girl? - Remember we're off the record. Yes, four, three since Allie's, two the press doesn't know anything about. Well except for Rodger, he's a big name. But they don't know all the details about how it was done. - Look detective Lowe. - Brent, please. - Brent I have something of a miracle going here, a unique situation that affords me to be sitting here right now. I am 70 years old, I am not about to jeopardize being free for the first time in 50 years, this is so different from me I don't even know where to begin. I'm not gonna. - Charlie, Charlie before I came here today I checked your log. I know that you were volunteering at the Gate Way shelters half way house off La Brea at the time of Allie's murder. You were in meetings at Stine Berg Publishing at the time of Rodgers. The time of the murders weren't even with in several hours reach of you. You're in the clear. - Well then why the secret visit? - I want your help. - Well I'm always willing to help, you all know that. - I mean I want your help. Not the station, no agencies, no other authorities. I mean I want your help personally. If this gets out it becomes a commercialized situation. It'll be like a circus coming to town. Are you willing to help me? - So no latten prints? No fibers, no DNA, no witnesses, no forensics of any kind to help you along with this thing? - To be honest no. All I have is a description of a man using what appears to be your old MO almost exactly. - So no real evidence to connect anyone. Well look detective I'm not an investigator, now sure I've been active in the phycology world and in education but I'm not a cop. - I don't need your investigative insights. - Then what exactly do you need? - I need you to get into the mind of this guy. He's obviously effected by your work. - Former. - My apologies, former work. He's duplicating your old style. You could work up a profile and into the head of this guy. - I don't know. I do have a penchant for helping on this side of things but on that side of things I don't know. - You'd be working with me and me only. No official record. Cassidy wouldn't even know. Cassidy? - My boss. - Look detective Lowe I have spent the last 50 years of my life struggling to dissolve those grains of sand from life's hour glass. - But you do that all the time I'm sure. I mean with your books and your speeches, those memories are necessary to do what you need to do, to say what you need to say, to help those people out there. - You're right. I haven't forgotten everything which is part of the equation as to how my system works. Blessing and a curse it is. - There are innocent people are being killed out there just so some psycho can get his kicks pretending to be you. - But if he's not pretending. There are 100's of well documented cases like this. If he actually he believes he is me then I'm not safe, I need some serious protection. - All the more reason. We can protect you. - Catching my own copy cat killer? I'll think on it. - Wardens and FBI agents have been trusting your advice for over 20 years Dr. Sorland. Here's my card. I'm up early. - Detective Lowe how did you connect the old MO similarities so quickly? It was a long time ago. - I'm very familiar with your case sir and I've studied it even closer lately. That's funny, I think I know why we adopted you.

Yeah. - What does that mean? - Look it up. So you're the guy I'm working with now huh? - Yeah Santos wen tot another jurisdiction. He sent you to me. - All right, here's what up. I heard jack about them killings from one of my junkies when we was at this party last week and he was talking about scoring some more blow from me. News reported about that guy, the old man, killer that went straight? Anyways he couldn't let that story go, soon he started talking to some other guy about poison and chemicals and all this shit. He's a little too into killers if you ask me. Maybe he's one of those morbid types that get off on that type of thing. - Did he actually say he was gonna kill someone? - Nah, I didn't hear straight talk like that just him being all into it. I don't know nothing else. - You're an informant so where's your information other than putting someone on the line for reacting the same way thousands of other people probably did? - I don't know, that's all I got. Take it or leave it. Damn man. Sometimes I think this shit isn't worth it just to keep me out of a cell. I aint trying to get locked up again. - Using your own stuff, the stuff we gave you? - What the hell man, do I look like a tweaker? I don't use, I just sell like I'm supposed to. - Why do they call you Fibber? Do you have a tough time telling the truth? - One of those naive, the world is as it seems, go getter cops. Nah, it's one of those ironic names that describes the opposite of actuality. You know, like a big dog named Tiny, or a little dog names Zeus. They call me Fibber but I always tell the truth. - So who does that work out for? Your customers or for us, because you can't be telling the truth to both of us.

Mind if I hold you up for a second? - What's up? - I know about your habit. But I'm not concerned about that, relax. - Why are you here then? - I'm investigating somethings in the area, some very bad things. I heard you were into serial killers and stuff. - Who the fuck have you been talking to man? Everybody talks about them, everybody watches them. Those forensic crime shows are hot, so what? - Let's take a walk. - Yo Jackie, we have a visitor, Detective what's his name. Don't worry it'll only take a minute. All right we're here. - That's yours? The shirt. - Yeah, so what? - Just seems a little big for you, doesn't seem to fit the whole tough guy motif you're going for. - Who in the hell are you to tell me what I wear and what I don't? - I'm not here to tell you anything, I'm here to ask you something. Who's your friend you've been talking to about chemicals? - What chemicals? Nobody man. - I heard your a fan of Charlie. - Charlie who? - Look the more you play stupid with me the more questions I ask. - Who the hell have you been talking to? How would you know about any of that huh? It's just small talk. Just like everybody else in this city's probably been doing since the old man got cut loose. Don't be putting that shit on TV if you don't want people talking about it. - What's that cart used for? - Groceries and stuff. I use that store that's right around the corner. For shopping. - Professional Murder Music. That seems fitting, is that your band? - No it's a killer band you wouldn't know anything about. - Well I guess I'll be heading on my way. You guys wanna get on my good side let me know if you hear of any talk. - Don't wait around for me, cause I don't know those types. - You're file Jackie down at the station might suggest otherwise. I'll have to check you guys out sometime. - You've doing enough checking out. It's not your crowd anyway. By the way I like your hair the other way you had it, like in your mug shot. More suiting for ya. Well guess I'll see myself out. - What was that? - I don't know. He's not concerned about the blow though. Somebody around here has been talking about too much bullshit that doesn't even matter. - Not me. Stich, Fibber, and what's her face were the only ones paying attention when that shit was on the other night. - So how are you on leads? - I got nothing, nothing solid. Meanwhile there's another body found early this morning. - Same as the others I presume? - Yeah and the only real lead I have that has any weight? Is this guy in a band. - Why him? - I got a tip that he had taken a liking to your case. Not the guy you are now but the guy you were. I went there I saw somethings, they got my attention just a little too much. - Look Detective Lowe this whole thing may be way over my head, I don't see how I can help you. - Look I can give you full case reports with evidence, witness accounts, locations, anything. - No suspect list though. - I need a blind work up. To see if your profile truly matches mine. - I don't know. - Look, I'll make this worth your while. If you can help me get this guy before he kills again I can get you a full pardon hearing. Do you know what that means? No more parol, no more looking over your shoulder. No more watching what you say or where you go. You can travel in leisure without permission or trace. No more log books, complete release in the states eyes. - Well that certainly is tempting. It's the topic of a lot of my dreams most nights. - I can make it happen. I know people, hell my father still advises for governor Travers. - I know, I remember dealing with your dad back in '84. How is he by the way. - He's good, thanks. Good enough to back me up. What do you say? All right I'll put together this case report for ya and get you on your way. Here you go kind sir. Think everything you need's right there. Let's see if we can catch this guy. - Hey Paule, get a sound check going, I'm gonna go outside for a minute. - Hey. Yeah? - Brent Lowe. - Detective Lowe, sorry to catch you at the end of your night, we have a 187 behind the pub Night Rock club on Sunset and Orange, can you dispatch? - I'll be right there. - It's finished, all alone at the scene.

No I wasn't I was gonna pull out my cellphone and call my guys to guard all the doors so you couldn't run before I had a chance to question you bout another damn murder that happened right behind the drum set over there. - I don't know anything. - Yeah, you just happen to be here at the exact time that somebody got killed in the same style that you've been killing them. - I didn't do it. - I got witnesses who saw you there. - You don't have any witnesses saying this song would kill anyone though do ya, huh? Do ya? Yeah course I'm here, my bands playing. Yeah and I have witnesses saying I was here all night. Jenny Valenor. - Who? - That's her name, she had a life. We found a bottle that didn't smell quite right. And when the prints, blood, skin samples, or even a flick of dandruff come back on that bottle or on her and it's yours? Well have a good set. - After going over everything here's the profile. I'm not making any promises but I think it's about as viable as any that I've done. - Male, of course. Late 20s to late 30s, I'm with you on that. Lives in a busy area of the city, probably not suburbanite. May have knowledge of chemistry or access to a chemist. Charlie, so parallel to my own profile, obvious and safe at best. - Turn the page. - Probably colored hair and other alterations to his body or appearance to hide who he used to be, or to become who he never was. An artist such as an actor or musician. What led you to this part about appearance and artist type? - 70 years experience in being me. Sadly I don't believe our guy ever killed anyone before these events. And that makes me feel sorrow and guilty with a portion of the blame, I don't think he ever would have killed anyone had it not been for his exposure to my unfortunate tale. - You're not gonna believe this but I have a prime. He fits the profile to a T. Not only his profile but the circumstantial evidence is near overwhelming. If I brought this guy in for questioning would you sit in on the interview? - All right I'll do it. Mhm, right, Dr. Williams this is completely out of my wheel house. So, no I admit, I admit when I was down at that station I snuck a peak at this guys file and I gotta say after seeing what I saw. He could be the one. No I would never, no. - No everything in this case points to you and no one else. Not a single person is on my radar except for you. Why is that? - Maybe you're attracted to me. You like brunettes, should I have my head and bring you outta heat? Ironic, you're trying to bust me for the very thing you wanna do to me right now. What's the matter, run out of kids to pick on back in high school so you go get your badge so you can continue it? - I have a blind criminal profile work up of the Century city killer copycat done by a well respected criminal psychologist who knows a thing or to about people like you. Do you wanna what type of guy he came up with? - Enlighten me. - You to a T, not by name but by description of who you are and what you do. And believe me he knows your kind. - Well he sounds charming. That's it, Charming Charlie. The man himself. Well I've been watching him real close to. So he did the profile huh, on me? Charlie, Charlie. Can I get a picture with ya? So you drag me in here based on a maniacal killers words. Man can I go now? The next time you think of harassing me I'm getting a lawyer and I'll have you on the new so fast, faster than you can change your mind. I mean a big case like this would get a huge cover story on the news right? I'm outta here. - I could easily get a warrant for a home search for drugs. I could hold him for that, it would buy me some time but he could raise this up, make everything crumble. This whole thing between me and you, it would be a PR suicide for the department. - Well how about surveillance? - I could do that but if anyone in the circle catches on even one time? - Right, how sure are you that he's the one? - About 80. - All right now I know this sounds sacrificial but maybe we wait, see if another body turns up. He may be scared straight now knowing that you're all over him he might just consider it a win at this point, cut himself out. - Yeah but I could put together case enough to charge him for the victims we do have. Yeah? Detective Dougan, I thought you were off today? - Not with the stacks on my desk. - If you make it to Sunset my seven you can stop Molly from going to heaven. - I wasn't expecting that. Look can you pull up a census sheet on everyone named Molly between Wilshire and Hollywood Boulevard and Santi and Normandie? - Yeah, I could do that. - Good luck detective. - I'll let you know what happens. What gives man? Something aint right. You're laying low, what's up? I'm talking to you. - What you talking about my dude? - I got cops all over my ass talking about stuff that nobody should know about accept for Jackie, Stitch, me and you. - Good, that leaves me out then cause I aint to snitch and I aint no bitch. - You got me that shook shook? - Soon, real soon. And I should make you pay double just for this shit, you're lucky I got restraint. Calling me trying to punk me out. If I was the old me you would have got touched already. Aren't you supposed to be locked up or something? - What would I be locked up for? What's that supposed to mean? - Man these cops man, they be hovering around here, knocking off everybody for petty bullshit. - Obviously I'm not. - Okay, all right man I got stuff to deliver, you messing up my business. I'm a get your stuff asap so be at your crib in a bit. - Yeah whatever, I'm gonna get my car, I gotta go somewhere first. - Okay I'd like to ask you a few questions. Yeah. - How long you been smelling the smell over there? - About a week. - About a week, okay. Ms. Paulison I appreciate you bringing this to our attention we're gonna have a unit out to investigate it as soon as we can and do you mind if I take this for a quick, I'm sorry I'll just be a minute. - Okay of course. - I appreciate it, thank you. Yup, yup. - Any info on the Molly situation. - Yeah I got six unharmed, ready to go. - That's exactly what I need to hear. - Yeah, I'll have all 13 Molly's in that perimeter rounded up and taken to my house, you know, for safety. - What's the missus gonna think about that? - All right I'll have them brought to the station. - Tell those black and whites not to over patrol, we need discretion. - Oh suddenly you're the one giving orders now? You know you're gonna make a nice replacement for me when I'm gone next year. - Nobody could replace you Cassidy. - All right, 104. ♪ Could it be all I've seen ♪ ♪ Is just a joke that they've played ♪ ♪ So I am turning to something new ♪ ♪ Regrets will come from deep inside ♪ ♪ And push me so close to the edge ♪ ♪ I see everything I want ♪ ♪ I see everything I want ♪ ♪ Chasing me through my dreams ♪ ♪ And it just will not end ♪ ♪ Found a way to this day ♪ ♪ And there's no turning back ♪ ♪ Could it be all I've seen ♪ ♪ Is just a joke that they've played? ♪ ♪ So I am turning to something new ♪ ♪ I don't think I'll ever forget you ♪ ♪ And the things that were promised ♪ ♪ I see everything I want ♪ ♪ I see everything I want ♪ ♪ Chasing me through my dreams ♪ ♪ And it just will not end ♪ ♪ Found a way to this day ♪ ♪ And there's no turning back ♪ ♪ Could it be all I've seen ♪ ♪ Is just a joke that they've played? ♪ ♪ So I am turning to something new ♪ ♪ I don't think I'll ever forget you ♪ ♪ I don't think I'll ever forget you ♪ ♪ I don't think I'll ever forget ♪ ♪ Chasing me through my dreams ♪ ♪ And it just will not end ♪ ♪ Found a way to this day ♪ ♪ And there's no turning back ♪ ♪ Could it be all I've seen ♪ ♪ Is just a joke that they've played ♪ - Where you going? - What the hell man? - Who's Molly? - Molly the fuck who? - Don't play anymore stupid than you already are, who's Molly and where is she? - I don't know anything. - You been sending me FAX's lately? - Yeah I have, I got one coming in for you just right now. - I'm working on your alibis. One of them is gonna come up flat. And when that happens, I'm gonna find the holes in the others, you can bet on it. - Well don't hold your breath. Yeah you're already out of breath, look at ya. - I get two legal hours to hold you and I'm gonna do it right now. Yeah, let's say till after seven. - I knew it. - You knew what you little punk? - I knew you were a fag. - Let's go, you're coming with me. Punk. I'll be sure to give my beautiful wife the message, let's go. - Yeah. Hey Cassidy, yeah we're half way back to my car now. - How do his alibis look? You've got no wiggle room, you can't hold him right now. You got nothing. - He was just off Sunset. Right where I thought he'd be, it's too perfect. You got nothing but trouble coming our way, let him go. - He has drug paraphernalia at his house, I can hold him for that. - Well then you're looking at probation in a few years at best. If you really think this is the right guy, you gotta be in it for the big haul. - Dammit. - If there's so much as one girl with one hair out of place tonight I'm coming for you myself without a badge. Got it? Now get up. - Hey baby, what's up? - They always come around. - Yes we sure do. - So what's it gonna be? - Oh I don't know let me see what I got on me. Oh look at that. Hey where ya going honey? I love this job. - Jason, where have you been? Stitch has your candy and Fibber has the money for the show. I also have something for you. I think you're going to like it. - That's great baby, can't wait but it'll have to wait I got something I gotta do first. - Sit on your hands. Sit on your hands. - What is this? You. - Whoa look what the cat dragged in. - Why? - To know you've still got it, that is age defying. I must say when I learned of those first two murders I was flattered but then the competitive side of me just came out. Quite frankly I can't have you cluttering up my legacy. I can't have you stealing my thunder. - Molly? - Prahket, Molly Prahket. - You're messed up old man. - To think that one can send a picture like that from a mailing store. It's a shame even my warning to our friend Detective Lowe couldn't save Molly from going to heaven. Oh I'll show you mine if you show me yours. There's Molly, Melisa Myers at Melrose and Fiarfax. Steve Windra, Griffith park. Karl Ravishaun, he is an Easter egg. Still undiscovered it seems and Jenny Valenore at the night club. You're turn. - Allie Gershwin, 101 on Vine. - Mhm. - Reggie Harletin. Mulholland. - That's right, all acounted for. You're two to my five, or your three to my four. I bested you, barely, you bag a big star in Rodger Harletin. I'll give you double points for him. - But. - Hands. Hands. - How did you do Jenny, what's her name, Valenor? - Oh about her, she was just too good to pass up. When I saw you throw away your bottle in the dumpster signifying what, that you'd taken yourself out of the game. I knew the cops would have you on the hook for that one. I had to take the freebie. - I always thought you'd be smarter. - Oh I am. - That cop Lowe? He's looking for this. You're done now. - Oh I might be if I were like you. A two dimensional thinker, just cause and effect. See in three dimensions I can improvise yet unpredictable scenarios like this one here. Puts me inside your head. Your showing up now means you'll be famous for all seven jobs just as you fantasized. Plus you need to be stopped and I need my full pardon. - Charlie. - Pardon me. Pun intended. Doors open detective. - Charlie put down the gun. What the hell? What happened here? - He brought this into my home. He held me at knife point, made me watch while he did this. Luckily for me he was so, so sickly entranced I was able to get my protection. I know, I know, I know it's a violation of my terms to have a gun but after this man began killing with my name on his victims I just had to assume I'd be facing a sinister situation at some point. I'm sorry, I apologize detective. - He's lying. He did all this. All right I admit it, I did the first two but he did the rest. Check them out. - Well the knife in the clothes will tell the tale Jason. He's a poor soul, that boy. - Get up. Put your hands above your head. Do it slowly. - They're gonna find out, believe that. - Dr. Sorland you need to come with us sir. This is a hot crime scene, we can't have you in here. - You know he admires me for all the wrong things I've done and detests me for all the right I've done since. Can you believe that? - I was recently told I was naive for believing the world is as it seems. I'm sorry Dr. Sorland but we wouldn't have found that poor girl if it wasn't for you. It's finished, I know this didn't end the way either of us imagined it to. - Well I can't take all the credit. - I'll work on that pardon. It looks like my Sargent Cassidy just arrived, he'll work on your processing and they're gonna clean things up. You take care Dr. Sorland. - Detective Lowe.
