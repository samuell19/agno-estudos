It it said the Amadlozi reach out to a select group of people, offering them special abilities. There are those that hear Ubizo, and reject it. Fearful of the sacrifice it requires.

[♪♪] [door closes] [birds chirping] -We missed it. -Shit! At least we tried. We are going to hit traffic so hard. It's not like we were given a set time or anything Argh, my shoes! Um... Um... You know what? Here you go. Sorry we missed it. Thanks. [indistinct chattering] FOOD JOINT BLESSING Blessing? Is that you? Babe? -It's Blessing. -TUMI: Blessing! [both chuckles] -Do you remember us? -She couldn't remember us. Uh, I'm Katlego and this is my husband, Tumi. Your mother, she used to work for us. You used to live with us. Yeah. You were like, yay high. Chubby. You couldn't have been more than five or six before Martha sent you back home. I'm sorry for your loss. Martha was part of the family. How did she die? No one told you? [scoffs] Typical. It was a heart attack. KAT: We were out shopping, came home and found her on the kitchen floor. Um, it was sudden, the doctor said she didn't suffer. Mm. Martha spoke about you all the time. Hmm. We left something with the pastor. Please make sure you get it, okay? -I'm so glad we met. -Um... Did she leave anything? Anything I should have? Of course! All of your mother's things are at the house. You can come by anytime. Here, take my number. [sniffles] [phone starts] [♪♪] [silence] -Excuse me? -Listen, we don't believe... in all that traditional ancestral stuff. You can't ignore who you are. It's nice meeting you, Blessing. [sighs] Martha's daughter... Bit of a weirdo, hey. How did she know about that? Mothers and daughters talk. Martha probably said something. [engine starts] It was quite an ordeal. [indefinite muffled chanting] [muffled chanting continues] [♪♪] [mysterious music, chanting] THE DOMESTIC [crows cawing] [♪♪] [phone rings] -[toothbrush buzzing] -[gargling] [spits] Hmm. Hmm. TUMI: I never get coffee drinkers. You might not like it, but you know how to make it. -You're not eating? -It's my fast day, remember? -Oh... -It's fine, just leave it for... Nice to see that Martha's death left such an impression on you, darling. Don't start. I'm in a rush. What am I supposed to do with this? Improvise. See you tonight. -Have a good one. -You too. [scrunches] [plate clatters] [♪♪] [♪♪] [sizzling] For what we're about to receive, we thank you Lord. -In Jesus Christ name, Amen. -Amen. [sighs] I miss Martha. Yeah, me too. Feels weird. The house just isn't the same without her. -Hmm. -[smacks lips] I guess we should start looking for a replacement. Yeah, but, where do you even start? I'm sure the neighbors will know someone. I'll make some calls. -Okay. -Hmm. As long as they're trustworthy. -Can't be too careful nowadays. -I know. Uh, the show house today babe... One of my clients, their friends told me this story, -honestly... -Yeah? Their friends told me this story, right? They hired a helper to take care of their mother who has Alzheimer's. The mother died, so they obviously had to get rid of her. only to find out that... [scoffs] she left with the woman's jewelry, worth hundreds of thousands apparently. -Wow. -Yeah. -Wow. -Hmm. That's why Martha was so special. Mm-hmm. -We could trust her. -Hmm. [birds chirping] [bird calling] GEORGE OVER PHONE: It's not my call. This other guy swooped in with an offer. And he impressed the hell out of our CEO. He wants him managing the account now, like effective immediately. Sorry, man. This is where we part ways. What can I say, George, I guess I'm disappointed, you know? I Hope the other guy sucks. And you guys come back to me with your tail between your legs. GEORGE OVER PHONE: [chuckles] Me too, man. Take care, Tumi. All right. Goodbye, George. [dogs barking] [cell phone chiming] Hey. KAT OVER PHONE: Hey. So, I spoke to Alexa. She knows someone. Her sister's helper's niece. She's looking for work. Okay, cool. Let's meet her. KAT OVER PHONE: What's wrong? Merchants dropped me. I lost the account. KAT OVER PHONE: Oh no! They were big! Yes. There's no loyalty in business. Seven years down the drain. [footsteps approaching] Hey, those dishes aren't gonna wash themselves, you know [chuckles] You're full of shit, you know? -Baby, I just had a rough day. -I had a rough day. -Woah! -[plates clatters] My pills. [sighs] You think we should up the dose? No. I'm fine. I'm fine! -Fine if they're working... -I'm fine. [ominous music, moaning sounds] KAT: Tumi and I, we love to entertain. Nothing fancy, you know, just a dinner party now and then I love to cook. It's a passion of mine. [stutters] Of course. And we have a room right here on the property where you can stay rent-free. Okay. Uh, how old are they? [Refilwe swallowing] They don't want to leave me. They follow. [laughs] [cell phone chimes] [birds chirping] HI. IT'S BLESSING :) [♪♪] You found it! Please come in, come in... -Thank you. -[chuckles] [groans] Excuse the mess. We're still looking for a new helper since Martha. Please come through. Let me show you. [door opens, squeaks] [♪♪] [window rattling] Over 10 years, Martha lived here five days a week. All yours, anything you leave behind I'm going to give away, though. I... I just want to apologize, for how I acted at the funeral. You did scare me a bit. I didn't realize Martha told you about that whole thing. BLESSING: I want to help you. A calling is a gift and it shouldn't be taken lightly. Um, thank you Blessing, but I'm not taking it lightly. I'm on strong medication, prescribed by a real doctor. You think it's a sickness? Seeing and hearing things that aren't there. -That is a sickness. -You're wrong. KAT: I'll be in the house if you need anything. [rain pattering] [door closes] [♪♪] [cell phone chimes] [cell phone chimes] [birds chirping] KAT: What are you doing here? How do you even know where I work? There's no fixing anything. There's no us. KAT: That's why you came all this way? If you're not gone in five minutes, I'm going to call security. Leave. [footsteps fades] MABLE: It's a beautiful home. Yoh! [Kat sighs] [stutters] It's a mess. My husband and I have been struggling. We both work, so we hardly have any time to do housework. What do you do? -I'm an estate agent. -MABLE: Oh. I work for Sacks and Brooks Realtors. -Tumi's a chartered accountant. -Wow! KAT: It helps that we can both work from home a few times a week. So, tell me more about you. I know you used to work for a good friend of mine, Bongi. Was that full-time? I worked twice a week. Mostly housework and baby care. So, you were also on nanny duty? It must've been fun. They're my little babies. Well, you don't have to worry about that with us. We never had children. No children? [laughs] I have enough problems. The last thing I wanted is to pass them down to a child. Can you cook? Peri-peri chicken is my speciality. Delicious. I love spicy food. [both laughs] Please, let me show you around. Yes, ma'am. -Please, call me Kat. -Okay. [♪♪] [dogs barking, howling] There's no attitude, you know? Some of these people will make out, like they're doing me a favor. -TUMI: What's her name again? -Refilwe. It's pretty, hey. [phone chimes] [Kat sighs] -KAT: Uh-oh. -What? -KAT: It's Blessing. -So? KAT: She wants a handout. Yoh, Babe! Judgmental much? -How do you know? -Oh, please. I noticed how she reacted when she walked through the lounge. TUMI: Oh, we already gave at the funeral. KAT: Exactly. She's just trying her luck. -Uh, just ignore her. -KAT: Hmm... [chuckles] You won't guess who came by the office today. -No! -KAT: Mm-hmm. -She didn't. -KAT: Mm-hmm. -For what? -KAT: Same old... Still having her 'visions'. Still looking for any excuse to see me. TUMI: Dude. It's the way she'd gotten the message by now, -you know? -Eish. At least she's trying. Maybe you should give her a chance. No. [sighs] -When is Refilwe coming again? -Next week. -That long? -Yeah. She's got travel arrangements to make. She's coming all the way from Pretoria. Okay. Okay. -Then we need to decide -Mm-hm. who's washing up tonight. Come on. Okay. Let's go. Ching... Chong... -Cha! -TUMI: Ah! Fu-- ONSCREEN TEXT Hey, Refilwe, just checking you're on your way? ONSCREEN TEXT Call me if you get lost. ONSCREEN TEXT Confirming my address is 8 Tyrone Ave, Bankrose. ONSCREEN TEXT Where are you? [♪♪] TUMI: If she wasn't interested. Why not just let us know? [sighs] Bongi says it's more common than you think. She also had a bunch of no-shows when she was looking. I'm telling you, she got a better offer elsewhere and couldn't be bothered to tell us. -[glass shattering] -Argh! Come on! [♪♪] Maybe we should just get one of those maid services. I already tried. It's a total rip off. Okay. Then what? Move into a one-bedroom flat that isn't a nightmare to clean? There is someone we can ask... She probably already has a job. Come on. What's the harm in trying? Let's at least see if she's open to it. I mean, her mom was a maid her whole life. Maybe it runs in the family. At least, we know we can trust her. Do we? [sighs] [dogs barking at distance] KAT: We never got a chance to clear out the rest of the room so... it's all yours now. Please, come to the house around five-thirty to set up the table and start dinner, okay? Ma'am? Um... Thank you for giving me a chance. I'm really looking forward to helping you. [chuckles] Five-thirty. -Okay? -Yes, ma'am. [♪♪] [Blessing grunts] [groans] [♪♪] [sighs] It was that snake, Dan! He knew I was with Merchant's. And he knew they were my biggest client. I don't understand how someone can be so heartless. Yeah. And he's always been poaching clients, that guy. Even back when we were at Monet's firm. And you sit here suffering, while he takes what he wants! TUMI: He gets away with it every single time. There's just no justice in this world. Forget about it. You'll find more clients. It'll work itself out, you'll see. TUMI: Hmm. That smells interesting. What are we having? My speciality. [chuckles] Enjoy. -What is it? -Looks like chicken. Doesn't look that bad... I think some salad will help. [plates clattering] It's like she's never been in a kitchen before. Well, she comes from a township three hours away. I mean, who would've taught her how to cook? Not everyone's been as lucky as us, babe. Nah-ah! This isn't luck. You worked hard for this. We put in blood, sweat, and tears to get to where we are. And I'm sure she will too. Look, we'll give her a one-month trial period -and see how she goes. -We? Who's going to teach her and show her around, you? Well, I mean with work and stuff, I'm trying to source new clients... Exactly. [scoffs] She doesn't take after her mother, that's for sure. [laughs] [chuckles] [♪♪] [♪♪] BLESSING: Good luck for work today, sir. Thanks. Sorry, I overheard you and Katlego speaking. Oh, that's fine. I made this for you. TUMI: Okay. [chuckles] Hmm. What is it? It's for good luck. [coughs] Spicy. Grainy. Good luck. Don't tell Kat about this, okay? You know how she feels about these sort of things. Oh, I've got a... a contract. Nothing hectic. It's just, uh, terms of your employment and states that you'll be working for us. Here you go. For a trial month. Is that okay? Mm-hmm. Just here, where your name is. -Here? -Yeah. [clears throat] -Thank you. -Pleasure, sir. And uh, thanks for... -Whatever that was. -[laughs] Alright, you-- you have a good day. [♪♪] [mysterious mumbled chanting] [chanting] [coughs] What're you doing? [stutters] KAT: Are you trying to burn my house down? I'm cleansing your home. To remove any evil spirits. You'll do no such thing. Cleansing my home? [♪♪] I want us to be very clear about how things are run in this house, okay Blessing? Ma'am, I'm sorry. I really didn't mean to... It's okay. It's fine. It's just that... I got a fright with all the smoke, you know? It's just-- it's very important to cleanse a home after there's been a death. Yeah, I don't believe in all that stuff, remember? This is a Christian house. We left all those beliefs with our elders. Do you understand? [♪♪] [toothbrush buzzes] [doorbell rings] BLESSING: Hello? [dialtone ringing] Hello, ma'am. There's someone at the gate. He says he's here to do the garden. KAT OVER PHONE: Sorry. I completely forgot to tell you. That's Junior. He comes in a few times a week. You can let him in. Oh, sorry ma'am. I'll let him in. [Blessing sighs] [crickets chirping] [rattling] [footsteps approaching] TUMI: Yeah, obviously, it's terrible what happened there. I'm just glad you want me back. Yeah. I can be there first thing tomorrow morning. Mm-hmm. Thanks George. [chuckles]Ciao. -Babe? -Hmm. TUMI: That was Merchant's. -They want me back. -Honey, that's amazing! What happened? It's actually quite hectic. Remember Dan? Hmm, client poaching Dan? Of course. TUMI: He was out cycling, he had this terrible fall. Broke both his arms. He's gonna be out of action for months apparently. -He's in the hospital. -That's terrible! But you know what's weird? I had this dream about him the other night. I feel terrible. You have nothing to feel terrible about. It's not your fault he fell. This actually looks good. BLESSING: It's an old recipe. TUMI: Hmm. Hmm. [munching] It's good. You have something to say? You seem just on edge. That's all. [scoffs] [grunts] This tastes like glass. Nah-ah! We said one month with her? Right? Nah-ah! -Blessing. -Ma'am. KAT: Listen. If you're going to be working under my roof, you need to follow my rules, okay? You keep your traditional recipes and all the hocus pocus out of this house. I'm not interested, and neither is Tumi. Okay? From now on, you prepare regular food. [mysterious panting] BLESSING: Ma'am? [mysterious panting] Are you okay? Consider this your last warning. [♪♪] [rattling sounds] [sighs] [huffs] KAT: There's no sugar. I bought... I bought this, like, a few days ago! Look again! [electric toothbrush buzzing] [phone buzzing] Kat, hello. Ma... All I want-- all I ever wanted as a normal happy life... All the superstition. Ma, I don't understand it. And with the pills that I'm taking, I never need to. Ma, the gift you think I have is gone! It is gone! How many times do I have to say this to you? Jealous down. [laughs] [laughs] Oh... waitress. JUNIOR: Oh... [♪♪] [groans] [coughs] And then? [♪♪] [sizzling] -Don't forget the water. -Yes, ma'am. -Hm, something smells delicious. -Mm-hmm -Drinks ready? -Yeah. -They;re probably here soon. -TUMI: On it. You didn't like it? If I eat any more, I'll pop. TUMI: She didn't like it. BONGI: Shut your face! KAT: Blessing! TUMI: Four months, hey. Mm-hmm. -Don't jinx it! -[all chuckle] You know, I've realized that true romance only happens after the divorce. You guys should try it. Oh no thanks, it's cheaper to keep up. I think we're doing okay. [chuckles] Oh. This is Blessing, our new helper. TSHEPO: Oh, hello Sis' Blessing! -BONGI: Hi, Blessing. -Martha's daughter. Thank you. -You can bring the dessert. -BLESSING: Yes, ma'am. [clears throat] So... What's she like? [chuckles] -She sucks. -Babe! It's true. She's weird, she hardly says a word and she doesn't know how to do anything! BONGI: Wow. [clears throat] -Thanks, Blessing. -BLESSING: Pleasure, Sir. She nearly burnt the house down. -[gasps] -KAT: Mm-hmm. I come home from work and she's burning the stuff. -Impepho? -KAT: Yes, exactly. I come home and there's smoke. The house is full. I mean, full of smoke. I thought there was a fire! [gasps] So she's one of those? TSHEPO: What? You know, like into her 'traditions'. She probably thinks she can speak to the Ancestors and that mixing toe-nail clippings with nuts will make you rich or something! Okay now, my grandparents were deep into that stuff and they would take me to the Sangoma all the time. And she would tell me about how she spoke to the Ancestors. There's nothing wrong with Sangomas, Tshepo. It's just an alternative form of medicine, like reiki or homeopathy. BONGI: See, that's not true 'cause anyone can do reiki. But not everyone can get the Calling from the Ancestors, right Kat? TSHEPO: Oh, so you had the Calling? You heard it? TUMI: She did but... she resisted it. TSHEPO: Why? Because it's not the ancestors. It's a mental disorder. Hearing voices, seeing things? Why on earth would I want to live like that every day? TUMI: She didn't want it. Exactly. As long as I'm on my meds... I'm okay. I'm on the right path. I mean, I thought that, you know, like once you heard the calling, you had to answer it. BONGI: That's because you're a coconut and you know nothing about our culture. You're basically like the whitest black guy -that I know. -[Tumi laughing] TSHEPO: What? Bullshit! I mean, you're way whiter than I am. Have you seen the way that you dress? Oof honey, have you seen the way you dance? [all laugh] Well look, anyway, I agree with Kat. All this spiritual stuff is old township superstition. [groans] No. Look Kat. You know, I think there's more to it than that. I wouldn't be so quick to just write it off as a mental disorder. Who knows, maybe if you embraced it, you might just surprise yourself. Whatever Kat's got, I'm pretty sure there's a logical explanation for it that doesn't involve all the spiritual crap. No, no, no. Hold on. It's not crap. All I'm saying is that people like to believe this sort of stuff is true because it's cheaper than going to an actual doctor. But it's bullshit. There's a reason that people like Blessing believe at all. I mean, you're dealing with an entire class of people that is completely clueless! [laughs] Obviously. [clears throat] Thank you. TSHEPO: Thank you. BONGI: Thanks. [all laugh] -BONGI: Baby? -TSEPHO: Yo! I told you-- I told you close your mouth. Guys. -You gotta tame that! -Tame? How do you...? There's no taming that, man. BONGI: Oh, come on. That was funny. -I've got to live with her. -I've got to live with her. Yeah, that's right. Sure. [all laugh] [utensils clattering] It's late. You can finish tomorrow. Okay, ma'am. [Bongi sighs, chuckles] Sorry for opening my big mouth. It's fine. I know it's all happening in my head, you know? Which actually makes it a lot scarier, in a way. You haven't spoken to her since that night, have you? No. Ah guys, thank you so much for tonight. Yeah. Let's do brunch soon, hey? [soft chuckle] It was yummy, as always. And, um, good luck with, um, what's-her-name. Hope she doesn't burn the house down. -Okay. Get out of here. Go. -Bye. -Bye. -KAT: Bye. [groans] I'm exhausted. [door closes] I wonder if Blessing heard us? Even if she did, so what? I ain't get it. You don't like her. Does that makes me a bitch? Yes. -But a sexy bitch. -[laughs] It's okay. A month is almost over. And in a few days we can say thanks but no thanks Can we just get to that part? -You follow me. -Oh. [♪♪] [breathing heavily] [rhythmic banging] [snorts] [♪♪] [chanting, clapping] [♪♪] [rhythmic banging] [coughs] [coughs] [gasping] TSHEPO: What's going on, babe? [gasping] Bongi? Bongi? Bongi? Baby, what's going on? [coughing, gasping] Bongi? TSHEPO: Bongi? [Bongi choking] TSHEPO: Bongi? No, man. Come on. No! Bongi! Bongi! [speaking indistinctly] [♪♪] -TSHEPO: Bongi! Bongi! -[Bongi coughs] Shit. Okay, I'm calling an ambulance, okay? [Bongi gasps] TSHEPO: I'm coming back. [inaudible] [♪♪] [Bongi gasping] KAT: Blessing! It was there last night when I took them out. So, it couldn't have just disappeared. I want to know, where is it. This is an antique set! TUMI: Woah, what's going on? KAT: I'm missing a fork. It has to be there somewhere. Maybe it's in the dining room. TUMI: I already looked it's not there. Maybe you didn't check hard enough... TUMI: Blessing, please look again. Yes, sir. [whispers] I'm telling you, she took it . Why would she take your fork? I don't know why she take it, but she took it. BLESSING: I found it. KAT: Where was it? BLESSING: It was under the cabinet. Why does it look like it's been under a rock for 50 years. KAT: It's fine I'll clean it. TUMI: Thanks, Blessing. Pleasure Sir. Babe... Can we not make it like the help is out to get us? Come on. We're better than that. I just had a bad night. The nightmares are back? You haven't had them for ages. Don't even... Please. [cell phone ringing] It's Tshepo. Yo! You're already asking for seconds, huh? You want some leftovers? -We're going to be late! -TUMI: I'm coming. Tumi! TUMI: Okay. Alright alright I'm ready. -Let's go. -Do you have the keys? -TUMI: Don't you have the keys? -Oh, my God! We're going to be so late! I found them. [glass shatters] Sorry, ma'am. Let's just get out of here, please. Money maker! [both laughs] It's all because of you. ...at the right time. Otherwise, they'll be weak. It wasn't that powerful. -KAT: Blessing. -Yes, ma'am? I need you to come in and pull the curtains. Yes, ma'am. JUNIOR: Yeah. BLESSING: Make sure that they're even. [♪♪] -Ma'am? -Hm? For you. A remedy. It'll help. With what? Your friend, the one who died. Thanks. [♪♪] [humming] GEORGE: Sir? [indistinct chatter] Seventy-five percent. GEORGE: No! [snaps finger] Tumi! Sorry, I um... [phone rings] [distorted sounds] [♪♪] It's probably in the wash, just try something else. No. No. -Bongi bought it for me. -Well it's not here. Obviously. Can you just ask Blessing to check in the wash It's a purple blouse with the buttons here. Please. [♪♪] I'm done with her, Tumi. She freaks me out. She's into all those rituals and stuff. TUMI: So were you Once Upon a time. All the ingredients, the recipes. No one knew them better than you. KAT: Not by choice! [♪♪] TUMI: I'll talk to her tomorrow, okay? [♪♪] What? -[chuckles] -Not tonight. JUNIOR: Blessing. Blessing. [speaks Zulu] She closed the door. [sighs] TUMI: Blessing... Sir! TUMI: Um... As you know, your trial period has come to an end. Sir... -I found the shirt. -Sorry? The purple blouse, it was in the washing machine, sir. I found it. Oh, great. Kat will be pleased. [smack lips] Um... You've done a great job so far. But... It's just not gonna workout. We'll pay you for the rest of the month, in full. Um... but if you find something sooner, you're welcome to leave. And, um... you should probably start on that. Um... we're gonna need you to um... find another place to stay. We'll give you an extra week of course, to get your stuff in order rent free, of course. [♪♪] TUMI: Okay. The sooner she's out of here, the better. Well then I'm getting a maid service, I don't care how much it costs. I'm not scrubbing any more toilets. KAT: Works for me. I just don't want anymore of her weird spiritual stuff in the house. It's... dirty... [♪♪] TUMI: Babe! Have you seen my toothbrush here? It's funny what's gone missing since Blessing came into our lives. [huffs] [♪♪] [♪♪] [mysterious whispers] [breathes heavily] [Tumi spits] [door opens] [door closes] Oh... Blessing, you're still here. BLESSING: I just want to say thank you. For what? BLESSING: For giving me a second chance. I promise, I'll do better. Excuse me? BLESSING: Tumi told me the good news. You're extending my contract. [♪♪] KAT: You said she could stay? You extended her contract. Tumi! Blessing is a good worker. How could you do this without me? I... I thought we were on the same page! [scoffs] She's already signed it. Wow. For six more months? Three written warnings before dismissal? We can't fire her without cause. You definitely made sure of that. Are you sleeping with her? What-- what, is she blackmailing you? -Kat. -KAT: Make me understand. We agreed to let her go! She deserves another chance. [grunts] [♪♪] [Tsepho sighs, clears throat] TSHEPO: No. No drugs in her system. They just said it was a freak muscle spasm. Her throat tightened and locked up. But... doesn't make any sense. I wish I could talk to her more than anything right now. What else? What's going on? It's Blessing. Your domestic? I wanted to get rid of her and Tumi told her she could stay. We had such a huge fight about it. TSHEPO: What's the problem? It just feels like... it just doesn't feel like my space anymore. It's like she's infected it. TSHEPO: I mean, you know, it's a new person in your home. It's gonna be an adjustment. Maybe you just need to get used to her. Maybe. [doorbell rings] DETECTIVE MOSS: My name is Detective Moss. I'm with the SAPD. [door opens] According to records, your previous maid Martha Nkanya, she passed away from heart failure. Is that correct? Coffee for you, sir. Thank you. Thank you very much. BLESSING: My pleasure. I'm-- I'm really sorry for your loss. I'm actually here regarding Martha's daughter... Blessing. I'm just gonna come out and say it. Blessing Nkanya was found murdered, but we think it's related to muti killings, given the brutal state of the body. It's-- it's an ongoing issue. Muti killings? Yeah, ritual murder. The victim's body parts are removed while they're still alive... and then used medicinally for all sorts of things. It's believed that the victim's suffering enhances the muti' strength. It's ugly stuff. When last did you and your wife had any contact with Blessing? -That's enough. -DETECTIVE MOSS: Excuse me? [♪♪] Don't worry about the mess, I'll clean it up. [water splashing] [door opens] [water splashing] What happened? BLESSING: Accident. Accident? Tumi spilt his coffee. Is that so? Where is Tumi? -BLESSING: He's out. -KAT: Out where? I don't know. KAT: Blessing? Ma'am? Tumi doesn't drink coffee. Maybe it was tea. [♪♪] [ominous music, chanting] [rhythmic banging] [ominous music, chanting] [cell phone chimes] ONSCREEN TEXT Call me. Please call me back. Urgent. We need to talk. ONSCREEN TEXT How can we fix this? Mom? [mysterious rattling] TUMI OVER VOICEMAIL: Hey, this is Tumi. You know what to do. [♪♪] What are you doing? Huh? What's-- what's wrong? What's going on? BLESSING: Ma'am? Is he feeling okay? I heard noises. It's just. I don't... Let's just get him inside, please. BLESSING: Yes ma'am. Why are you so dirty? He looks tired Drink. [coughs] BLESSING: Drink it all, yes. [Tumi slurping] BLESSING: Ma'am he needs to rest. Yeah, I'll get him to bed. [♪♪] [mysterious rattling] [♪♪] [distorted screeches] -I slept very well last night. -Oh, wonderful! Good morning, Miss! KAT: How are you feeling? TUMI: Better. I had some weird dreams last night. Sure. You woke up late this morning. Are you not going to be late for work? You don't think we should take you to a doctor? Do you remember what you did yesterday? TUMI: The usual, nothing out of the ordinary. Ma'am, I made you something to drink. [stutters] How much do you remember? Do you at least remember what we spoke about? Why are you questioning me? BLESSING: It's my own recipe, it'll help you feel better. KAT: Because you haven't been yourself lately. [Tumi] I'm fine! Thanks to this lovely lady right here. [Blessing laughs] BLESSING: Are you sure you don't want your tea? I don't want your damn tea! BLESSING: Sure? TUMI: Hey, what's going on with you? With me? [scoffs] I feel like I'm losing my mind. Babe, come here. [groans] It's Blessing... she needs to go. Aw. She's not that bad, you'll see. I called my mother. She'll be here tomorrow. You were the one pushing for me to reach out to her. I'll tell Blessing to make up the extra room.

[laughs] [clears throat] We like her very much. [soft chuckle] [♪♪] Hmm, she's part of the family. [Tumi munching] Tumi is just finishing up some work in the study. Call it what you want, Ma. It's just-- it's worse than ever. It's like my pills have just stopped working. [sighs] [breathes heavily] [chanting] [chanting continues] [chanting continues] [pants] [gasps] [breathing heavily] [moaning] [both moans, grunts] THANDO: [speaking Zulu] [breathes heavily] [♪♪] [panting] [chicken clacking] [chanting] [pants, sobs] [rattling sound] [groans] She knew I rejected my calling. And she knew the moment we met? [grunts] No... No, I didn't know. But you took it out of me. [grunts] [panting] By almost killing your own daughter. [grunts] [speaks Zulu] [♪♪] [chanting] I'm still taking them. What? Hang on. It doesn't make sense. [♪♪] [Thando chanting] [chanting continues] [breathing heavily] [moaning] [♪♪] [chanting in Zulu] [chanting in Zulu] KAT: Tumi hasn't been himself lately.

[♪♪] [♪♪] KAT: [speaks indistinctly] Hmm? [chuckles] [screams] [Kat cries] Mama! [cries] So much potential inside of you. Each piece of you. I just wanted to help you, but you mocked me. You refused. So now... I'm just going to help myself. [Kat moans] [chanting] [♪♪] [♪♪] Tumi, hold her down. [whispers in Zulu] [Kat moans, screams] [Kat screams] -[click] -[mysterious whispers] [Tumi groans] TUMI: Katlego. -[screams] -[Blessing moans] [Blessing moans] I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. [♪♪] What are you gonna do? [♪♪] [Kat chants] You don't deserve any of it. But it's a thing I intend on changing... [Blessing screams] [Kat chants] [Blessing screaming] [♪♪] [growling] [whisperings] [♪♪] [blood splattering] [♪♪] [bones rattling] KAT: Our culture believes that life does not end with death, but continues in another realm inhabited by Amadlozi. It is said Amadlozi reach out to a select group of people offering them special abilities. These people are called by Amadlozi to accept these gifts, and live as a Sangoma. Helping and healing those in need. When I was a child, I was afraid of my gift. I thought I wanted a different life from my calling. But it is said, you cannot reject ubizo for you are called upon for a reason. How can I help? [clapping] [♪♪] [♪♪]
