You know I pray that I'm ready. Hey what's going on, brother? Alright. It's a maze over there, man, of just death, hell, and destruction. Used to be a bench over there. I was sitting on it one time waiting on this guy to bring me some weed out the building. A white Bonneville pulled up. A guy got out with a revolver and shot him in his head. I'll never forget feeling blood just splatter on my face and I couldn't hear because my ears were ringing and I remember walking back to Duval Street where my daddy house was covered in blood and my daddy told me I had to make a decision then. Either you was gonna be a wolf or a sheep. And if I was gonna be a sheep, clean myself up, and go stay with my mama. If I'ma be a wolf, lick the blood off and stay with him. I was about maybe 15 years old. I got addicted to crack out here. Heroin. Pain pills. I just medicated myself to deal with a lot of the stuff I seen. Once I started getting high, I couldn't sell drugs no more because I did 'em all so I'll just sit and let you sell 'em and then come take everything. At one time it was either give it to me or give it to God and God don't want it. And that's how I was. Just wild. Any robberies, home invasions, chasing people down the street with guns. I feel guilt. I feel a little shame. At the same time I feel empowered because I feel like if I could change, anybody could. When I came to the Richmond City Jail, I was feeling helpless, lost. [bright music] I walked in the pod. Initially I was apprehensive like I'm not going in no damn program. - There's no gangstas up here, fellas. It's about changing attitudes and behavior. You have to do something different. You have to, fellas. [bright music] - I believe in the debt. Second chances, they deserve it and I'm gon' give it to 'em. - [Woman] Let's just look this over. - [Man] Yes ma'am. - [Woman] It says which he then took place before the decoration. - Man, if heroin is the answer, what is the question? - [Man] Man, I'm not going in no program, but I love music so I went. [gentle music] - [Woman] Walk on through. - Where is it at? It's in a secret pocket. - No secret in the pockets. Arms out to the side. Alright. - Thank you. - So this is one of our male program pods. So right now we have about 65 men on here. Everybody you see on here has volunteered to be apart of the program. So they're here for however long they want based on behavior or until we remove them possibly. [audience clapping] - What's up brothers? How y'all doing? My name is Speech. And I'm from the hip hop crew Arrested Development. We call our music life music, which means that we appreciate this journey of life. We heard about what the sheriff was doing here and how unique it was and I personally wanted to come here and get immersed into it all and help out. So I'm gonna be here for the next almost two weeks and we're gonna be writing some music. So maybe I'll get to see y'all again at some point, but thanks y'all for having me.

I'm just curious and I don't know if you wanna share this or not, but what's your story? Like how did you even end up here? - I'm learning something in here. Something called trauma. And all of these things that I'm going through now started back then without me knowing it. This is what confused me and I think messed my life up. Right here this moment. One day, my stepdad beat the breaks out of my mother. My mom lip was swole, her eye was closed, and she could barely see out the other eye and I came home. I called the police officers. Police came to the door. My mother answered the door and the police officer said, ma'am what's wrong with your face? Are you alright? Is this man hitting you? And she said no, I fell. They could not take Travis. They couldn't take him because she said that. So that point, I didn't understand what life was made of. I didn't know what it was about because he just beat the bricks off you, mom. I tried to help you and save you and you know he left. When the police left, Travis beat the breaks off me. He was whooping me for so long, my legs was swollen and purple and I remember that he told me the next day. It was summertime. The next day he told me that I better wear these Wrangler jeans so the people don't see my legs. ♪ Look I started with nothing ♪ Ain't no pain, no discussion ♪ Need to change my direction ♪ Or just gon' cause an eruption ♪ ♪ I think I'm way too explosive ♪ ♪ Think it's too much destruction ♪ ♪ I got some pain up on my name ♪ ♪ And it's waiting to crush me ♪ I been dancing with devils ♪ Up on way higher levels ♪ I need the ax and the shovel ♪ Just to clear out the rubble Went through 13 different foster homes. Seven different group homes. I ran away from everyone. Started playing with guns. I started smoking weed everyday. Then when I got older and progressed, I started sipping lean and I was drinking so much yellow and green promethazine that I started having seizures. Then I was popping pills and then I was sniffing dope because I was selling dope. I became the plug. That's where I ended up at, man. That's how I ended up here, man.

[bright music] How you feel? - I tell my story. When I was doing heroin, I OD'd 15, 16 times, but when I do, when I go back out there, I go back out there looking for some more. That's the sickness of the disease. So I got to change my thinking. - A jail is a short term holding facility. People are only here for on average four to five months. Whether they are to be released back into the community or shipped to prison. Everybody is in some sort of transition. It's our job as a programming department to make sure that they have that transformation that they need so they don't get out and continue to do the same thing. Thus leading back to incarceration. - Eventually you know what happened 'cause that demon is just laying there dormant.

[guitar music] I really don't know like what happened. [guitar music] - There certainly were other options, but you know how I grew up, my mother she was like a queen pin. You know, she was really, really successful. She had like this notoriety around this area. Really all of Richmond. You know hustling. Being out late night. So I just kinda embraced that and fell into her footsteps and I thought that maybe it was my destiny to do this as well unfortunately. [guitar music] I started playing guitar when I was 12 years old. I was really into it. You know I played in a band and you know we were doing really good, and then my band mates, they got strung out on heroin and I was selling them. I started selling them heroin, too. I'm not in here for drugs, you know. That was just how I even had the gun, you know, because I was selling drugs. I needed to protect myself. [guitar music] Me being in here has kinda made my mama to change her way of living as well. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey.

Are you hard working? I want you to choose words that describe you and will set your resume, set you apart. Let's see. This needs to be reworked. Okay, so how we doing here? - So how do I answer? What's a good way I can answer the question when they ask me oh I see you have a lot of gaps in your job history? - [Woman] If they ask you that question, you say yes. I would like the opportunity to explain. - Here we go. [gentle music] You know I'm still trying to get adjusted to life out here. The world is moving so fast and I'm so far behind. Yeah man, if I get this job, man. Hey man, you ready? Yeah you know it's a toll? How much is it? - $4. - Four? It's been awhile since I even went to a real interview. I mean literally like 18 years ago. Chaspo Ice Company. It was cold. It was an ice factory. Yeah. I ain't keep it long. I end up going to prison for eight years. One is an issue right now. Especially coming out, you need you know things to survive out here. It's not a good feeling to have to go to your mother or your girlfriend at 37 and have to ask them to buy me underclothes. God I pray that you would show favor when I go in here for this interview. Just be with me. In your name I pray. Amen. That was fast. He just asked me about my job history. I don't have one. I just gotta be patient, man. Not get frustrated when I gotta wait. In the past, you know me not wanted to deal with the frustration when I have to go through certain processes, that's when I you know I almost go backwards. You know I make a bad decision. You know what I'm saying? But failure's not an option so I'm not going backwards. I just don't wanna be in nobody's trauma unit or come back in no institution as an inmate.

I would come home, get a job. You know do good, do well, and get locked back up, you know due to my character defects.

He has his whole life ahead of him and when he gets out, he will either take the path unknown, which is this new path of redemption, or he will take the path that he's become more used to. To be honest with you I don't know which one society's gonna meet because he's been really going back and forth with even just being in the program itself. I mean I was expecting to get with him and I didn't see him for a long time. It was because he got in some type of confrontation with a guard. - Each time you break a rule in the program, you get what we call a sanction, and Anthony got three sanctions between yesterday and today and so it's an automatic 24 hour lockdown, but we haven't removed him from the program yet because he is trying. - [Anthony] So just because it's not lengthy, does not mean I didn't put my all into it. Took me like four hours to complete this and actually be honest about it 'cause I know you weren't gonna play no games with it. - Alright, so read me the awesome Anthony pieces. - It says I am intelligent, giving, athletic, a good dad. I should've put a decent dad and a cook. - [Sarah] That's some good stuff. - Yeah, that's what I was. Those are things that I was. Things I wanna change. Says I wanna change my attitude, coming to jail, committing crimes, lying, fighting, doing drugs, my angry personality, and my quick response. - Alright so tell me why do you think your reactions are always like instant bad? - I mean can work on it. - Every time somebody tells you something, you automatically think there's malicious, bad intention to you. Right? And so your head is already always going at they're against me. They're waiting for me to fail. They hate me. Instead of thinking how can this actually help me?

It's like my little safe haven. I'm gonna save like his last cigarette, which is kinda crazy, right? When he went back and I have like all of his deodorant and like things that he gets in the mail. Like silly you know coupons for cigarettes. It just would not feel right to like throw it away. Just different things. Letters that he sent. I get a lot. I visit Garland every weekend. I don't miss a weekend. I can't imagine missing a weekend. We actually went to school together since middle school. So since like 13. My family and my friends were like what the hell are you thinking, you know? And they just kept telling me like when he got out, that he would go back to his old ways and all this and I was really, really. I'm not a naive person. I was like really, really sure of it all. That he would be good and he was changed. You know, he swore to me up and down that he would never do drugs again and I believed him. I mean that's like six and a half almost seven years in prison. Bam next thing you know. Just a couple months out and he was on drugs again. And then I found out that he was doing drugs in prison. When Garland walks into a room, he catches everyone's attention with his smile, with like brightness, the shine in his eyes. It's amazing. When he's on drugs, that's all gone. It's just gone. It's wiped from his face. I couldn't have been more wrong, I guess, with thinking that he was never gonna use drugs. So I'm not for sure. I'll never say I'm for sure 'cause the worst thing in the world was when I was so for sure and I was so wrong and it's hard not knowing when he's gonna be back. And it could be a long time. - Hey, there she is. What's up? You look beautiful. - [Kelly] Thanks babe. - Let me get a kiss. What's that?

Believe me, I know. - Like one of the things I think that's gonna is like your biggest struggle is like facing things and like owning it. You know what I mean? It has you laugh. Go figure. That's the thing. It's like sometimes I get upset when you laugh stuff off because when you were in prison and you were like telling me like, oh you know I'm totally different. I knew then that you were like how you were looking at things was not realistic. That's you know a big reason you are on a video screen in front of me right now. - [Garland] Yeah. - And thinking like you know my head's where it needs to be. You know a month later, here we are again. - [Garland] I know it's true but I don't like hearing it. I don't know. - It's like it hurts your pride or something. - [Garland] I don't know what it does. - I know but it doesn't give me like a lot of help that like you are getting what I'm saying. - What should give you help is I'm being honest about it.

Like removing that tattoo. - That's how real it is. If he was to see me getting this removed, it could possibly spiral into something else. - There gonna be obstacles, but you can overcome that. Look at the obstacles you've overcome. You're still here. - Yeah. Yeah. - This is the first Mother's Day that I've shared with you and Erica together in what maybe eight years? - [Teddy] I thought it was five so that's even worse. I'm sorry, baby. - Yeah. - [Teddy] I'm sorry. - [Mother] Don't let it happen anymore. - [Teddy] I'm sorry, baby. - He's here to tell his story. So make what you been through count. [gentle music] This base right here is a lot of things I collected as an interior designer and have like a eclectic taste. [gentle music] This is visiting Teddy in. I don't remember what facility this was but this is 2006. This is my brother, myself. Teddy and Erica, his sister. He's been in psychiatric facilities maybe eight, nine times for the earliest when he was maybe like nine. He was suicidal and homicidal at nine. He was going to therapy. We went to family counseling. In one of the counseling sessions, it came out that their father was abusing him and I had no knowledge because he was doing it when I wasn't there and he was threatening them. If you tell your mom, then I'm gonna kill you, your sister, and your mom. So he had started self-medicating I guess like 12. His own father got him started smoking crack and selling drugs. You know the good that's in a person that you love and this other person you don't know who they really are, what they're capable of. I've had like fear of safety. When your child steals from you and you give them all that you can give 'em and you try to always be there, it hurts. So I know he has greatness in him, but he also has demons in him, too. This is Teddy's little puppet that my mother bought for him when I first gave birth to him. Teddy was maybe a couple hours old. His name is Teddy as well and I've kept him 37 years. I've moved 100 times but I still have that teddy bear. [piano music] - Just listening. [piano music] So many things have been revealed over these last few days for me. Teddy's own father started him off selling crack. De'vonte's whole family selling drugs and just how easy it is to get caught up. What are these generational curses that we carry? I didn't come from a family that sold drugs, but what would I have been if I came from that type of reality? What choices would I have made? I did come from a family where my dad was unfaithful to my mom and I ended up imitating those very things early in my marriage. I have to live with the consequences of cheating on my wife. I have to live with it. She has to live with that. But if I had to sit in a cell for a decision I made 20 years ago, could I bare that weight? Could I bare the weight of that mistake? I hear this a lot from the people in here. Yo, I made a bad decision. Not to mention when they get out, they still have a stain on them. That doesn't feel right either. So on many levels it just feels like an injustice. - Wind blowing. But yeah this the store right here I got the eight years for robbing. When I was 20 years old, I made a bad decision in the store man and then it's altered the course of my life and my children, my family. That's a long time to be locked, man. It's a long time to be locked up. Richmond's finest. It go back to the power of decisions, man. Like you make the wrong choice, it's over. [gentle music] - Found out that Anthony was locked in this morning and I was concerned because we already talked about helping him several times. He's had several different opportunities make a change in his behavior and now he's been disruptive. This has been a constant thing with him. We been pretty much you know trying to support him, you know staff wide for awhile. We have to do something pretty decisive. - I'm trying to come out to go to the studio and the deputy is just like no, you're not on the list, and I'm just like who are you talking to, bruh? In just that right there can be considered as aggressive. It's nothing that I can do and I don't get caught. - 24 sanctions. Look at me. Turn the other cheek. Walk away. Shut your mouth. Got to pick it up. I can't keep giving you these passes. This is it. If you're gonna stay in the program right now, you're gonna get it together 'cause if you go downstairs to population, you're gonna be eaten up and you are come out way worse. That's no question.

[upbeat music] - You know he got more chances than probably anybody, but there's just a point in time when we had to put down our foot and remove him from the program. So we transferred him back downstairs into population. [upbeat music] None of you all are owed the REAL program. You're not owed the recording studio.

People call me Truck. And I built this whole facade around that. You know like my mom named me Garland Thomas Carr, you know, and she gave me that name for a reason. You know and some people still call me Truck. You do it because that's how you met me, but don't do that anymore please. It took me 34 years to be the person that I don't wanna be anymore. You know what I mean? And I know that there are much better things out there for me and I want those things. So I'm willing to do whatever I gotta do to get 'em. Thanks for letting me share. [audience clapping] - [Group] Grant the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom. - [Man] Can you open the door, please? - I'm getting out and I'm going home. My lawyer came to see me and told me that the Commonwealth said that my case is too complicated. They don't feel like dealing with it and they'll be willing to give me time served. - Wow. Okay so that expedites things a lot. - I do need some help. I don't have any housing. My family ain't accepting me. The family that I do have still live in the projects and the ones that would might accept me, I don't even wanna go there. It's just straight in the projects. I might as well go back and pick up a gun and some drugs. Might as well. I really don't have no idea what is exactly gonna happen when I walk out of the door. You know, all I literally know is I'm going down that street to the 14th Street Bridge, crossing it, and from there I don't know. - Everything they told us was some bullshit.

Don't tell him what to do but ask him, what are you willing to do? Are you willing to get help? [gentle music] - He had gotten a job and actually his first day was supposed to be yesterday. So I went out and I bought a backpack and thermal so when he ride to work you know he'll have that, but I couldn't reach him but that's strange because I been talking to him everyday and he finally did respond and he was apologetic. He was feeling at a low place and he was saying that he just couldn't go on like this anymore. He said he just wanted to give up. I told him that I loved him. I asked him was he safe. Picked him up and we went straight to the hospital. Last night, he was in such turmoil that he just started just beating with his fists on the sofa.

He hasn't earned the privilege to go to the REAL house to be honest, but he like he literally has nowhere to go. He's gonna be homeless when he gets out. He has nowhere to go. So I told him he has one chance and if he blows it, he's done, he's out, and he will sleep on the streets. End of story. - Up until 20 minutes ago I wasn't sure if I was gonna have a place to stay, but Sarah's giving me an opportunity and I know that that's God. Nothing but God. I'm appreciative of that.

Steal and destroy. You know what I mean? Burn bridges. That's all I've done. - [Sarah] You're gonna make mistakes.

You seen the house, room by now. The program comes first. - I'm scared a little bit. Scared of might doing drugs. I'm scared of reality. Reality, man. That's what I'm scared of. Reality. - Two things are happening. I got court and I turn 35. It is my birthday. 35. Supposed to be a jury trial, but I am just gonna plead guilty because I'm guilty. We're just gonna move to go through a sentencing. When I just think about going in there and being like look man, I'm sorry. You know what I mean? I get a better feeling. You know what I mean?

It's extremely nerveracking. Try to zone it out and act like it's not bothering me, but inside it's like slowly killing me. Like having a cancer and not even knowing. You know you used to always kind of wanna like avoid reality and you know kind of tiptoe around things, but the fact that he chose himself to plead guilty. Nobody swayed him. His lawyer didn't sway him. I didn't sway him. I think that says a lot about where he's at mentally and I think that shows a lot of growth. I just hope he doesn't regret that. [gentle music] - You know you get the right of allocution. You get to say something. You get to speak up for yourself. I would just say when I came home from prison in 2015, I didn't give myself a chance. I was using drugs the whole time I was in prison. I kept using 'em when I got out. It wasn't long before I committed a few more crimes. It looks like I got a pattern and by all rights I could be sent back to prison for a long time. [gentle music] I can't say like I'm not supposed to be here. Like this isn't. It's not that. It's that I know I have something more to offer the world. I know I do.
