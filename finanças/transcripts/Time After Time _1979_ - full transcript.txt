Now, you mind your step, Jenny. Nah, go on, don't you worry none about me. I can hold me gin. I'm right as rain. - Ta-ta, love. - Oops. Mind how you go. ♪♪ ...above her brow.. ♪♪ Go. Oh! ♪♪ ...above her brow ♪♪ ♪♪ ...above her brow ♪♪ ♪♪ Come along dear ♪♪ ♪♪ E-I-E-I-E-I-O ♪♪♪♪ It's.. Oh. - Evenin'. - 'Good evening.' It's a raw night, isn't it? 'Yes...raw.' You'll ruin them fine clothes. Would you like this? Come straight to the point, don't you, love? Well, my place is right along here. ♪♪ ...above her brow ♪♪ 'No.' There. We are in a hurry, aren't we? Come on, then. Oops! Come along. Oh. Right you are, sir. Wouldn't want to break it. Oh! That's lovely! 'We got our own band!' 'Ha ha ha!' Come on, then. I'm hot.. ...and gettin' colder, if you take my meanin'. Ooh. 'What's your name, dearie?' 'John.' John.. John.. 'Oh, John..' Oh, John! John.. 'But my friends all call me Jack.' Oh.. 'Is the gazette going to continue' with your pieces on free love, H.G.? Free love sells newspapers. Gentlemen, I give you the fleet street Casanova. Hear, hear! Well, I've got my little experiments to pay for. You're the hero of the working class, H.G. Free love is the only sort they can afford. Oh, Lord, don't start him on socialism in heaven's name. We'll have to listen to a sermon on the subject from Father Wells. You oughtn't call it a sermon. You know, I don't believe in organized religion. Socialism is the path mankind must inevitably tread on its way to a utopian society. Mckay's right, you know, we've heard all that. 'What's this great announcement' 'you've brought us all to supper for?' Have you found the cure for gravity? I think I'd prefer to wait until we're all here. Dr. Stevenson is here, Mr. Wells. Thank you very much, Mrs. Turner. Would you send him in? Good evening, John. - Gentlemen, good evening. - Hello, John. We'd begun to despair. Have you dined? There's still a little roast beef I think. - Hopefully good. Try some. - Thank you, no. Perhaps a little brandy to take away the chill. I'm sorry to have missed supper, but a physician's hours are not his own, I'm afraid. Gentlemen.. - Good health! - Cheers. Now, what has Herbert left for me tonight? 'Chess will have to wait, John.' 'You're only just in time for the big surprise.' Isn't he, H.G. The great, big whatever-it-is? - Am I? - I was waiting for you. I'm all attention. Very well. Gentlemen, I have called you together tonight to bid you farewell. Farewell? Where are you off to? Another holiday in Scotland, eh? No. No, I am going traveling but I'm not leaving London. Indeed, I do not expect to be leaving my laboratory. Mmm, riddles again. Gentlemen, I am talking about traveling through time in a machine constructed for that very purpose. What? Poppycock! 'Why?' Electric light, gentlemen. Courtesy of Thomas Edison, the modern Prometheus. Good heavens.. You were really serious! Good God, I don't believe it! You've actually built the bloody thing! Well, free love has paid for most of it. Yes, I've no doubt. I didn't think practical jokes was in your line of sport. Twelve years ago, a French engineer harnessed the power of the sun to run a printing press. My time machine derives its power from the very same source. You can't be serious. You mean this thing is propelled by sunshine? This cup catches the rays of the sun converting its heat to electricity here. Electricity does the rest juxtaposing fields of energy, creating friction. The result is an ever-increasing series of reactions that lifts, or literally rotates, the machine out of one time sphere into another. 'The cruising speed is two years per minute.' You can go into the past or future at will. Two years per minute. Acceleration will keep the machine and its occupant outside all time spheres in a conscious but vaporized state. How do you determine in which direction you're journeying? Well, if you rotate to the west, you gain yesterdays. To the east, you accumulate tomorrows. Balderdash! Go North, you get to Glasgow. The machine is designed with several safety features. 'The reversal-rotation lock' automatically returns the machine to its starting date after the completion of a voyage. If the occupant is injured during the course of a flight the passenger is returned to the point of departure.. ...unless he uses this key to countermand the device. 'Without that key, then, the thing's a bloody homing pigeon.' And what, may I ask, is this? Well, John.. ...this...is the vaporizing equalizer. Without it the passenger journeys through time without the machine. And without the machine, there is no coming back. 'Well, H.G., which is it to be, the past or the future?' Oh, the past, surely. He'll want to meet Cleopatra. The future. Now why the future? Because I belong there. Within three generations the social utopia will have come to pass. There will be no more war, no crime, no poverty and no disease, either, John. Men will live like brothers and on terms of perfect equality with women as well. Oh, dear. Let's have the past. Hear, hear! I can't agree with you. Check. Really, you astonish me, H.G. In the midst of all your theorizing you manage to ignore the facts. 'The evidence of human history is that' we live in a cosmic charnel house. Mankind has not changed for 2,000 years. We hunt. We're hunted. That's how it is. That's how it shall always be. The future will prove you wrong. The future will tell. Anyway, I have just one question for myself. When do you leave? Uh, I'm not sure. 'Human frailty at last.' Well, to be quite candid.. ...I haven't quite worked up the nerve. Oh, first time H.G. ever lacked nerve! No, but I will. All I've got to do is to set the date and activate the switches in sequence. 'Of course you'll find it, and I'll inherit the Hope Diamond.' Checkmate, Herbert. - 'How does he do it?' - 'Not again.' 'Every time.' I know how he thinks, that's all. One day I shall win. Yes, when you learn how I think. Oh, sorry to interrupt, Mr. Wells but there are two gentlemen from Scotland Yard who would like a word with you. Gentlemen, what is the meaning of this? Uh, beg pardon, sir, I'm sure. Mind we have a word with you, sir? The Ripper? In this vicinity? 'I'm afraid so, sir.' We've cordoned off the entire neighborhood. We're asking the folk hereabout to cooperate. Will that be alright with you, sir? Your housekeeper will sleep the better for it. - Of course, by all means. - Oh, thank you very much, sir. What's happened? Apparently, the Ripper has struck again. - No! - Oh, my Lord! Goodness! He hasn't been heard from for years! Nor in this part of town! No doubt about it, I'm afraid, gentlemen. He has a very distinctive style. Blimey. I think you'd better have a look at this, sir! 'That's Dr. Stevenson's bag.' 'That belongs to one of my guests'. What did you say this man's name was? Stevenson, John Leslie Stevenson. He's chief of surgery at St. Bartholomew's. I'm afraid he's also chief of surgery in Whitechapel. Nothing upstairs, inspector. All windows are locked from within. - And the skyline? - Also closed. We checked the roof, sir. There was no sign of him. What's in back? A dead end mews with a high brick wall, sir. He's not gone that way, I'll take my oath on it. - He was with you just now? - Yes. He must have gone out the front somehow as we came in. It doesn't matter, we know who he is 'which is a sight more than we did until tonight.' 'We'll round him up.' If you gentlemen will accompany me I'll see that you reach your homes safely under a police escort. There's bound to be an explanation. Beyond belief! 'Thank you, dear. That's my umbrella.' 'I've never been so frightened.' 'That bag, I don't know how many times' I've put it in the closet for him. I wonder he didn't take it with him when he left. Then we'd never have known. He was always such a gentleman. Yes...a gentleman. I wonder where he got to so fast the coppers couldn't find him. They searched high and low and we were by the front door the whole time. 'Oh, well, if he's fooled them all for this long' 'I don't wonder he's fooled them again.' What did you say? I said, we were by the front door the whole time. When you learn how I think. Nineteen-seventy-nine. What have I done? I've turned that bloody maniac loose upon utopia. Mr. Wells-- Bring me the housekeeping money Mrs. Turner, all of it. And any money you may have of your own, if you please? I'll make it up to you. - How much? - Uh, £15 and sixpence, sir. Will you want it all? All, if you please, Mrs. Turner. - Oh. - Something wrong, sir? Uh, no. Would you mind awfully? Money may not answer, I'm afraid. I may have to trade with the natives. Oh, let me see. The key.. 86 years.. ...two years per minute. That makes 43 minutes. Estimated time of arrival would be.. ...11:15. Alright. Utopia. Mr. Wells? Mr. Wells?

San Francisco? California! Of course! Eight hours difference. 13...14...15 pounds. This money's quite old. You're aware of that. But they're still good, aren't they? 'Sure.' It's just that a coin dealer would probably give you more for them. Here, all you'll get is the current rate of exchange which is.. ...$25.50. $25?! Really. It's the same all over. Money makes the world go around. It's just worthless unless-- Money, yes. Everyone needs money. Tell me, has there been another gentleman here, uh, recently? Uh, another Englishman dressed like me with currency like mine? 'Not that I can recall.' And they would have sent him to me if he wanted to exchange pounds for dollars. I see. 'Gimme a big mac, an order of fries' and a small Coke to go, please. Thank you, dear. Gimme a big mac, fries.. ...and tea to go, please. Pommes frites! Fries are pommes frites! Mmm. I never saw wood like this before. Amazing, I haven't seen stones in settings like these since before the war. - The war? - Since the second World War. - You know. - Did you say, World War? Since World War II, I said. Um, how much are they worth? Oh, today's market... $6000, easy. Uh, would you like to buy them? Oh, I-I couldn't give you top dollar, I'm afraid. Oh, that's alright. What's your offer? Uh.. Um...hmm...uh.. Uh.. $4,000? Very well. You don't want to think about it? Okay. Uh, may I see some ID? 'You know, uh, driver's license or credit card' 'something like that?' I'm afraid I don't have some. I can't do business unless I have some identification. How do I know these aren't hot? Hot? - You know, stolen. - Stolen? I assure you, sir, I give you my word as a gentleman. Come on, give me a break. What's this "gentleman" stuff? How come you don't got any ID? 'Ah, look, let me do a computer check on the stuff.' 'If it's clear, we can do business.' In a week, you'll have a check! I don't have a week. I don't believe you exist.. but if you do, I need your help. Just let me stay the night and I'll be on my way in the morning. And not trouble you again. I'm sorry. We're closing now. Utopia. $200, $300, $400. There you are, sir. Thank you. May I help you? I'd like to see the officer in charge of foreign currency exchange. You're looking at him. You?! But surely there must be a gentleman? Don't be a chauvinist. It's taken me three years to make it to foreign. What's the matter? Don't you believe in women's liberation? Women's liberation? Well, I'm dreadfully sorry. I meant no disrespect. As a matter of fact, I was all for it, so I shouldn't complain. You were all for it? What changed your mind? Nothing. Uh, I don't know whether you can help me. May I help you? Thank you. I'm certainly willing for you to try. I'm looking for a man, another Englishman like me who may have tried to exchange some money here. I'll say! Then he was here? Yesterday afternoon, big as life. With a money belt that was even bigger, must have weighed a ton. - Friend of yours? - We were traveling together. And now I've, um.. I've lost him. His name was John Leslie Stevenson? That's him, alright. I tried to get him to open an account with us but he only cashed a couple hundred dollars worth. You wouldn't happen to know what's become of him? And where he's got to, I mean. Well, as a matter of fact, he asked me to recommend a hotel. An hotel? So I sent him to the Hyatt Regency on Drumm street. Uh, Hyatt Regency? Yeah. Oh, thank you. 'You here on a visit?' Tourist-type thing? Mm-hmm. Well, if you don't know anyone perhaps you'll let me show you around. 'We San Franciscans are pretty proud of this old town.' Well.. ...yes, uh, perhaps that might be nice. Well, it's your option. You've got the card. Give me a ring if you feel like it. My name's Amy. - A ring? - You know. Da-da-da-da-da. Oh, yeah. Da-da-da-da da-da da. My number's on the card. What's your name? Herbert.. ...Wells. What was that? That was a very cute man. Mm-hmm. That was a pickup. Against bank rules. I don't care. At least he's not gay. Plus, I love the way he talks! How about that suit, early American? He'll be back. - What's up, doc? - I beg your pardon? You were saying, where to? Could you please take me as quickly as possible to the Hyatt-- Who is it? 'Your breakfast, sir.' Bless my soul. May I come in? Certainly, certainly. You were, literally, the last person on earth I expected to see. You've given me quite a turn. But now I think of it, there's no way of preventing the machine from returning. - I haven't the key. - No. 'And you managed to find the nerve after all' after I'd tested your machine for you. And how did you manage to track me down once you'd got here? That was brilliant. We must add, "detective" to your list of accomplishments. You're a regular Sherlock Holmes. I'm not here to engage in idle banter with you, Stevenson. You've used me. And you've used my machine to escape the hands-- I must congratulate you on that device. I confess that at dinner the other...century I thought you'd lost your wits. But fate intervened and forced me to ascertain for myself that you are truly the Columbus of a new age. The dawn of time travel. I salute you. I want you to come with me now. Yes, of course, where are we going this time? To the museum. I'm obliged to take you back to face the consequences of your acts. You can't be serious. You're so Victorian. You'll take me back. How do you propose to do that, by force? Be reasonable, John. We don't belong here. We've violated-- We don't belong here? Let me show you something. Sit down. 'Come on, I won't bite you.' 'Sit.' Now, look. 'Palestine terrorists carried out their threat' 'and began shooting the first 5 of 106 Israeli school children.' 'Held hostage for 18 days in a-- 'You haven't gone forward, Herbert.' 'You've gone back.' 'We've just received word that' 'Mayor Griffin Margolin of Columbus, Ohio, was shot-- 'We don't belong here?' On the contrary, Herbert. I belong here completely and utterly. I'm home. 'It's you who do not belong here.' You, with your absurd notions of a perfect and harmonious society. 'It's drivel.' The world has caught up with me and surpassed me. Ninety years ago, I was a freak. Today, I'm an amateur. You go back, Herbert. The future isn't what you thought. It's what I am. Do you know that you can go into a shop here and purchase a rifle or a revolver. It's perfectly legal. These people encourage-- Stop it! It's catching, isn't it.. ...violence? You know, you finding me here is rather fortuitous. For me, that is. Otherwise, I'd be obliged to search for you. Well, are you going to give it to me? I have no idea what you mean. Of course you do. I'm talking about the key. I can't have you following me about eternity like the Flying Dutchman. 'Give me the key, and we'll be quits.' The key? I don't have it with me. Herbert. Herbert, I've played countless games of chess with you and the one thing you cannot do is bluff. I want that key! Uhm! Oh, god! Maid. Senor! Stevenson! 'The car hit him.' - I beg your pardon. - I'll talk to you later. Just a minute, please. - Yes? - I'm looking for a patient. Recently admitted less than an hour ago. - He was in an accident. - Name? John Leslie Stevenson. Not here. But they told me he was gonna be brought here. This is San Francisco general hospital? Not here, not under that name, anyway. Next. He must have only just arrived. He was hit by a motorcar. - 'A motorcar?' - 'Pardon? ' You mean a car? Yes...a car, yes. He's a tall, flaxen-haired distinguished-looking Englishman. 'Just a minute, please.' Oh. I'm-I'm sorry. But an accident victim answering your description died 20 minutes ago. We had him listed as John Doe number 16. Died?! But that's absolutely impossible. I saw him sitting up after the accident. 'His chart says, "internal injuries."' It happens that way sometimes. Uh, wait! May I see the body? Are you family? Are you a relative? He doesn't have any relatives. I'm sorry. Wait a minute, please. Excuse me. O-R-A-J. "'Orajovsky"..' Oh, hello. You decided to let me take you to lunch! Hello. Um, what did you say? I said lunch on me. What do you say? Oh, well, um.. Just let me get my things. Uh.. That is what you had in mind? Yes, certainly, if you like. Wait right there. All set. Where to? Well, it's your city. I'll leave it up to you. I know, something with a view. 'Don't worry, it's perfectly safe.' 'We haven't had any trouble since the big one in 1906.' Knock wood. - 'The big one?' - 'The earthquake.' Don't you know about that? You haven't done your reading. It leveled the whole shebang. The shebang? I see. Mmm-mmm! This is delicious. Far superior to that Scottish place where I breakfasted. Scottish? MacDougall's. - What about your friend? - Friend? 'Dr. Stevenson.' Well, he wasn't exactly my friend. We had a bit of a falling-out. I won't be seeing him again. I like that suit! Is that what they're wearing in London? It was when I left. Is that where you're from, London? Everybody I ever meet from England's from London. I'm sorry. What were you saying? Oh, I was asking if you were from London 'cause, um, I have some friends there. I thought maybe you might know them. 'Course I realize it's a pretty big city and everything but, um.. Anyway, their name is Phillips. He works for Coca-Cola. Any chance? - No, afraid not. - Oh, yeah, well. You probably move in different circles anyway. Are you, um... Are you a scientist or something? Whatever makes you say that? Just a hunch, I don't know you give me the impression of someone who's cloistered away somewhere most of the time in a library or something doing research and never reads the newspaper. Oh, well, as a matter of fact I used to write for a newspaper The Pall Mall Gazette. Really? Well, shows how much I know, right? You were a reporter? I wrote articles on whatever struck my fancy. Social issues, mainly. The last thing I did was a series on free love. Free love? Mmm. Jesus. I haven't heard that term since the eighth grade. Tell me something did you think it was very forward of me to invite you to lunch like this? Do you, uh, often invite-- Do I often invite strange men to lunch? No, I do not but it's not often that a strange man turns me on. Or a strange woman. Oh, don't get me wrong. I didn't mean to imply I was a dyke. - A dyke? - Oh, sorry. Lesbian or anything like that 'cause I'm not. I like my sex straight. It's just that I do go for months sometimes without meeting anybody who does it for me. You know what I mean? A lot of people, like, um 'like my friend Carol, you know I'm not telling tales out of school but 'a lot of people can just sleep around, you know' But not me, I really have to like the guy. Otherwise, it's just no-go. 'I'm sorry.' I guess I shouldn't say all that stuff right off the bat like that. It's not women's lib. I just get nervous. When I get nervous, I tend to babble. Do I make you nervous? Yes. You do, sort of. Why? Because I like you. 'Hmm, if you think that's something you ought to see the Golden Gate.' Oh, what's that? Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Now, how did you decide to visit this place stick a pin in a map or something? The Golden Gate. The Golden Gate. 'Hey, you want to drive across it?' Oh, is it for motorcars? "R" stands for reverse 'and "D" stands for drive. And the right pedal causes us to accelerate while the left retards our speed.' 'Of course. Honestly, Herbert' 'you act as though you've never been in a car before.' 'Non-sense, I was in one only this morning.' You're a very good driver. Damn straight. My husband used to drive in the stock-car rallies. 'He taught me good.' 'What you thinking about?' 'A brave, new world that has such people in it. 'May I ask you a question?' 'Sure.' 'You mentioned your husband before.' 'My ex. ' 'Yeah, I was married for a while' 'when I was very young.' We met during an anti-war demonstration.' Ah, the second World War? Are you kidding? How old do you think I am? Oh, I'm sorry, uh. The third World War? The Vietnam War. 'Vietnam?' It's just that he wanted me to give up work and have children. You know, the housewife routine. Not for me. He never took my ambitions seriously. What about you? You married? I wouldn't be here with you if I were. Well, that's nice. A lot of guys.. Well, it's no big deal. I like that. As a matter of fact, I'm also divorced for similar reasons. She wanted you to be a housewife? She wanted me to be routine. 'Oh.' Well, that is one thing you definitely are not. I don't know what it is. First, I thought it was your voice 'or maybe your clothes.' 'Now, I don't know.' 'Maybe it's that kind of' little-boy-lost quality you give off. brings out my maternal instincts. You're very perceptive. Lost is what I am. Hmm. No. Herbert? Herb-- Herbert. Herbert. It's only a movie. I hate all that violence. Did you ever see Red Shoes? I really got off on that. Careers. It's almost six. Do you have plans for the evening? Actually, I haven't made any. Are you tired of me yet? No, not in the least. Great. How about I cook you dinner? I don't live too far from here. You sure it's not too much trouble? Are you kidding? I'm half Italian. Italians love to cook. What about the other half? Norwegian. Norwegians love to eat. What on earth is that? - Isn't that incredible? - Uh huh. They built that for the Pan-American exposition of 1914. Somehow, it's still standing. I love living next to it. Come on, I'll give you the cook's tour. I'll bet you don't have anything like this in London, right? You've never seen the Albert Hall. Oh, well, hell, I've never even been to London. Where do you live? 'This way.' 'You should see this place when they turn the lights on at night.' Is it marble? Would you believe plaster? 'What on earth is Cosmopolitan?' Where are all your books? I don't have all that many. I know that's terrible but I just don't seem to read that much anymore. I never have time and when I do it seems easier to watch the TV. Even though that's mainly crap. What's that? The phone. Ted's idea. Hello? 'Oh, hi.' This is my friend Carol from the bank checking up on you. Yeah. Uh-huh. No. Who knows? Well Carol, I'm trying so will you please let me get on with it? 'I have to go now. Bye.' 'Carol says hi.' She wants to know if London's really crawling with Arabs. Arabs? She wants to marry into oil. This is almost ready, I wonder if you mind if I changed my clothes because I've been in my work clothes all day. I really won't be a minute. No, please, please. You go right ahead. You look very beautiful. Herbert, if you don't take me into your arms this very minute I'll scream. Well, hello there. Hello. Why, Miss Jones, you're gorgeous. What? You don't close your eyes. Well, neither do you. Gee, these are the funniest buttons I ever saw. It's like it was some kind of costume. Oh, my gosh. Is the rest of this outfit as interesting? Amy. Amy. I don't want to compromise you. Are you quite certain I'm not forcing you to do anything that you'll regret-- Forcing me? My god, Herbert I'm practically raping you. Yeah, that's true. Here. 'All naked and it's all happening right here. This is where we got the hottest wildest, sexiest ladies in San Francisco, sir. Come on in and check it out. Sir, this is the one, come on. Take the young lady's advice. This is where it's happening. Come on in and check it out. God's great, sir, you ought to come in and check it out. If you're old enough, you're bold enough. This is the one. Hold it, now, hold it.' 'Come here, come here, come here let me show you. 'The biggest, the best here, hey.' 'The largest in the West here.' Now, wait a minute, fellas..' 'And the weather for this fine November day' 'should be sunny with low clouds along the coast.' 'It's a nippy 51 degrees at present' 'going up to a high of 68' 'then dropping to a predicted' 'overnight low of 43.' 'In the news this morning..' Good morning. Good morning. You want some coffee? Mmm. Thank you. '...walked into City Hall yesterday' 'and shot and killed Mayor Kevin Margolin.' In local news, another nude body the second in 14 hours has been discovered in the North beach area. Identified as Cindy Chow, a prostitute the brutally mutilated corpse was found by trash collectors in an alley behind the City Lights bookstore. Police refuse to comment on the relationship between the murders stating only that the style of the killings is similar. According to Police Chief Rod DeVito there are no leads as yet. In other news, the stock market opened..' - No. - Coffee's ready. How do you take it? Is milk okay instead of cream? I have to talk to you. I'm running late. 'Amy, I have to talk to you now.' He's alive and out there somewhere and I've no idea what's to be done. You say you're after this man. Are you a detective or something? You work for Scotland Yard? Well, let's just say that their interests are definitely involved. I don't understand. Why can't you go to the police tell them who they're looking for? What's wrong with that? They'd never believe me. You don't know that. They'd never be.. If you knew the whole story you would never believe me. I'd believe you. Well, they wouldn't. If I told them the whole truth they'd pack me off to a lunatic asylum and not him. Yeah, your right. I led you to him, didn't I? What were you doing, visiting bank after bank? Would you have gone to bed with anybody who told you where he was? Oh, Amy. You don't suppose that for one minute. No, I guess I don't. I don't know, this is very confusing. And I'm late, on top of everything else. Wednesday morning is executive staff meeting. I'm sorry. I didn't want to burden you with all this. Look, I'll get dressed and go. Oh, no, no, no, please you stay. I don't know what to say. Listen, I like you. 'I like you very much. I'd like to see you again.' But I don't know how to help you if you can't go to the police. This is crazy. I don't even know where you're staying. Yesterday was my first day. Well, you stay here for a while. Have some breakfast and try to sort things out. I'll call you if I get any bright ideas Okay? Be sure and slam the door when you leave or it doesn't lock. One thing I never would have pegged you as. A detective. Well, you look like the cat that ate the canary. Did you? Hi, Carol. How's everything? "Hi, Carol. How's everything?" I don't know. You tell me. You're the one who took off the whole afternoon. In one word, fabulous. He's.. I just can't describe it. On second thought, please don't try. I may just die of envy. Well, I want you to meet him. Could you come for dinner Friday night around 7:00? I'm sure it'll be fine with Herbert. Herbert? You must really be hooked. I think so. I'll just check my busy social calendar. Talk to you later. Hello, again. I've come to change some more currency. Oh. 'Yes, of course.' How much did you have in mind to exchange this time? Oh, say, 40 guineas. Forty guineas. Uh-uh, I'm sorry. Would you excuse me for a moment? I'll be right back. Take your time. Herbert, Herbert, Herbert. Come on, come on, come on. Herbert? Herbert, it's me. Listen, Herbert. He's here. 'Amy?' Wh-who is? 'What do you mean "who"? Who do you think?' What? He's right at my desk with a money belt. He wants to change more sovereigns. Herbert, what do I do? I'm terrified. 'Amy, Amy, be.. Look.' Be calm. It's perfectly alright. You're in the middle of a bank. He's mad, but he's not stupid. Now, nothing's going to happen to you. Listen, can you keep him there? - What? - 'I know its a lot to ask.' But try. Just until I get there. I'm on my way right now. I'll try. What-what-what did you say? I said I'll try. Uh, sorry about that. I was checking to see what the exchange rates are this morning. You know, they fluctuate every day. I wouldn't want you to get gypped. Are you enjoying your stay in San Francisco? - Very much. - That's wonderful. Did they find room for you at the Hyatt Regency? Yes, thanks to you, I've.. Thanks to you. You wouldn't happen to know a man called Wells, would you? I thought so. Miss Amy Robbins. He asked you to detain me until he could get here, is that right? I don't know what you're talking about. Oh. Well, I don't think I'll conduct my business here anymore if it's all the same to you. 'Good day.' There's just one other item. Be good enough to leave a message for Mr. Wells from me. Tell him I want that key. Tell him to leave it for me at the exhibit. Leave the key or face the consequences. Have you got that? Yes, I believe you have. Herbert, you got to bring the police in on this. Now, if you don't, I will. That man is crazy. I could see it in his face. And he threatened you. 'Something about leaving the key to the exhibit.' We've got to go to the police. Now, if you don't, I will. But I don't know what to tell them. Herbert, you can't fool around with a person like that. He's crazy. "Robbins. 2340 Francisco." 'His name is John Leslie Stevenson.' English. He's a surgeon. Approximately 37 years of age. Flaxen hair, clean shaven and stands well above six feet in height. What makes you say that this Dr., uh, Stevenson Stevenson is responsible for the death of these two girls? I just know for a fact that he is. I see. Do you have spiritual powers? - Do I what? - Have spiritual powers. Are you a medium or a mystic? I make no claim to supernatural gifts of any sort. If I could reveal the source of my information.. As a matter of fact I'm also a detective. I was sent from London on the trail of John Leslie Stevenson traveling incognito, of course. 'My name, uh..' My name is Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock Holmes. I see. 'Go on, go on.' But I-I can't go on. I-I've given you a complete description. I've told you the man's name. I've told you everything that I know. Well, it was certainly very good of you to come in and share your insight with us, Mr. Holmes. Uh, where can we reach you in case we want to speak with you again? Is that necessary? You see, it's rather awkward. I'm staying with a friend, um. Must we involve her in this? Unless it's unavoidable that we contact you. Otherwise. We're known for our discretion. Very well. Her name is Miss Amy Robbins. She lives at 2340 Francisco. Okay, thank you for your time, Mr. Holmes. You don't believe me, do you? Mr. Holmes, I'd like to believe you. My job would be a lot simpler if I could. 'But this is a computer printout it says U.S. Customs has no record of a John Leslie Stevenson entering the country. British customs has no record of anyone by that name leaving Great Britain.' And there's also no mention of a Mr. Sherlock Holmes coming into the country, either. 'Now, of course' 'he could be using another name.' But, since we don't even know where he is at the moment we can't very well pick him up for questioning. Can we? No. Well, thank you for your time. Good day. Put this on file. 'Entire affair was a fiasco.' He didn't believe a word of it. Well, you tried. Trying isn't good enough, I'm afraid. Are we in or out, here? Out. Would you care to join me for a walk? Sure. Uh-uh. You have to slam it hard. Old buildings have their little quirks. Why is it your responsibility? Alright, I'm.. I'm going to tell you the truth. 'In the first place' my name isn't Herbert Wells it's Herbert George Wells. 'H.G. Wells.' In the second place.. ...I'm 113 years old. I swear to God I am telling you the truth. Please, please, believe me. Oh. And where are you going? 'Home.' You don't believe me? Christ, Herbert, what do you think? Please go away. I don't want to see you anymore. Amy, please. Amy, listen to me. I have listened to you and a bigger crock of shit I never heard. Look, I don't know if you're crazy or what but anyway, I don't care. Just go back to whatever hole you crawled out of. Go back to your machine. Amy. Wait, Amy. Amy. Amy. Amy. What if I can prove that what I've told you is true? - Oh, Herbert. - But what if? Won't you give me that chance? I know I sound mad. Don't you think I knew how you'd respond? Didn't I say yesterday that when you knew you wouldn't believe me? And I said I would. Alright.. ...there is an H.G. Wells exhibit with time machine. Alright.. ...there is some resemblance between you and the man in those pictures. 'The museum is closing.' 'But that doesn't prove anything.' Now what? I want you to go to the powder room. 'The museum is closing.' Hang on. - Hello. - Hi! Holy shit, flowers. Wow. Well, let me go put these in water. Come on in. - You're early, you know. - I couldn't wait. Aw, you're cute. 'God, the last time I had flowers was my graduation in high school. Do you give flowers to all your women? Why don't you sit down? I'll be right in, okay?' You want some grass? Grass? Yeah, marijuana. Don't they call it grass where you come from? England, right? I could tell from your accent this morning. You're very observant. Are you a typical American woman? Am I a typical American woman? Me? 'Mm, yeah, more or less. You know.' I like to hang out. 'And what about you?' Are you a typical Englishman? Not really. Hey, neat watch. Are we going somewhere? No. Well, what time is it? Later than you think. This is really dumb. What's this gizmo? Well, let's just say. that we wouldn't want to go anywhere without it. Right, well, this time I'll drive. Come on. Get in. You sure you know what you're doing? What am I saying? This is completely bananas. I don't propose to take you any great distance. Suppose we just go forward to this Saturday. How would that be? Just fine. My cleaning's due back. That would make it November the tenth. Now, don't expect too much. The entire voyage will only last about a quarter of a second. Are you ready? Come on. 'Well, we're here.' Good. Can we go now, please? You still maintain this is all poppycock? That wasn't exactly the word I had in mind. Amy, you just wait. You wait.. What's the matter? Ah! Uh! Amy. We've got to go back. We must go back. You know, we could easily avoid this whole thing. You mean, give him the key? No, I mean, come back with me. - 'Back?' - Yes. Back to 1893. I'm a 20th-century woman. I have a career and a mind of my own. Be reasonable. How am I going to make it in 1893? Is your work so important? It's your life we're talking about. My work is my life. As much as yours or any other man's. Please, don't start sounding like my husband. Wait a minute. What about forward? Forward? You mean, into the future? Yes, of course, we.. No. No, we're forgetting something. Him. I can't just leave him here to do what he likes. So much for your place or mine. Stop a bit. You know, we're making a big mistake. We keep imagining that time is our enemy but it's not. 'We know what's supposed to happen when and where. 'He doesn't.' This is one time I do know how he thinks. I even know before he thinks. Look here.. ...we're too late to prevent the murder of number three, Shirley Beckwith. 'But what about number four? Let's see.' "Dolores Marks, she was killed in McLaren Park." Is that far from here? Nothing's far from anywhere in San Francisco. Well, she was killed or rather, she will be killed at three o'clock in the morning in McLaren Park. So, all I have to do is to be there and surprise him. I'll sit tight here for a few hours and then be off. We. I'm coming too. No. I absolutely forbid it. Herbert, you can't drive. You don't even know where the park is. I'm perfectly safe. I've got till Friday at 7:30. Haven't you read the paper? It's too bad there aren't any sporting goods stores open this time of night. Whatever for? So we could buy a gun. He's dangerous, in case you hadn't heard. Well, I wouldn't purchase a weapon now even if I could. Oh, what is this, Victorian chivalry or something? We're playing for keeps, here. Exactly, and Stevenson was right about one thing violence is contagious like measles. And the real problem with progress is not that things aren't more efficient. The trouble is, they're the same things. World War this.. ...World War that. Oh, we're obviously killing much more efficiently but we're still killing. Well, I'm not going to stoop to that man's barbaric level. The first man to raise a fist is the man who's run out of ideas. I love you. Oh, no. What's happening? Oh, God damn it. The.. The tire is flat. Can you mend it? Can it-can it be repaired? Yes, uh, yes. But it's going to take time. Alright, Amy, calm down. Now, you work as fast as you can and I'll go and telephone the police. Now, where would I be likely to find one? I don't know, Herbert. There are phone booths all around here. - Do you have a dime? - Hmm? Herbert, do you have ten cents for the call? Hurry! De-oh-look, here. It's 9-1-1. 9-1-1. Read the instructions. I'll be right back. Out of order? Damn! 9-1-1. Oh. Did you get that? McLaren Park. Get there as soon as possible. Oh, what? Wells. No, it's-it's, uh, Holmes. Sherlock Holmes. McLaren Park as soon as possible. You alright? Yeah, I think so. 'Oh, no.' No. 'Keep moving. Don't stop.' Don't stop. Do you hear me? Oh, my God. Come on, Amy, go! Come on! I don't want to die. I don't want to die! First the zodiac, and now this. Yeah, they're out for blood, I see. Oh, I see our Mr. Holmes called last night. - What time would that be? - That was at 2:45 a.m. Maybe he is psychic. No. We won't be here. It's very simple. We just won't be here. It's almost 10:30. I'm going to go out for a few minutes. - No! - Just for a little bit. I'll come back, we'll get into your car and be off well before 7:30 tonight. Where are you going? There's something that I've got to do. You do trust me, don't you? I'll tell you what. What's the best hotel in the city, your favorite? The Huntington. I used to work there. The Huntington. Write down the telephone number. If I'm not back in an hour then you register at The Huntington Hotel. You've got the car. You promise you'll be back. You promise me. I promise. I promise. You try and get some rest. Here, there's a little brandy in the flask if you need it. That's alright. I have some Valium. Sedatives. Alright. Try and get some rest. Hold it right there! What is the meaning of this? Shut up! Amy! - Well, look here. - Listen to me, constable. - Amy! - Come on. No. Amy! Amy, get out of the house! If you could just get Lieutenant Mitchell down here.. You're going to have another murder if you don't let me go. State your name, please. I've told you, Herbert George Wells! - What is this thing? - Your valuables. Preposterous! Please hurry. Please! There is a young lady who's in very grave danger. Your watch, please. My watch? This is ridiculous. Where is Lieutenant Mitchell? Is he around? Oh, you don't need that. It's just a key. - Yes, we do. - Look, there is a woman. Miss Amy Robbins in very grave.. Why do you need my glasses? Now I...look, please. Where is the lieutenant? I demand to see Lieutenant Mitchell! 'I'm sorry, we have no one by the name Amy Robbins' 'registered at The Hotel Huntington' 'and I have no reservation for anyone in that name.' You've absolutely no right.. Look, please, let me see Lieutenant Mitchell, please! Look, now! Soon! Hurry! Please! Help! 'I've told you. I've told you 50 times.' 'My name is H.G. Wells.' 'I came here in a time machine of my own construction.' I'm pursuing Jack The Ripper who escaped into the future in my machine. Now, if you don't do something 'he'll have killed Miss Robbins by 7:30 tonight.' What about the gun? They weren't making that model back in 1893. That's Korean war ordinance. I've told you. I just purchased it. I purchased it to defend Miss Robbins should the worst come to the worst. - Where did you purchase it? - 'At a pawn shop.' Look, I don't remember the name. You're wasting your time. Please, listen to me. I mean, forget about the shop. Forget about the time machine. Forget that I'm H.G. Wells. Please...please, just save the girl. I'm afraid you'll have to do better than that. Last time, you were Sherlock Holmes. 'Alright, let's take it from the top.' My name is H.G. Wells. I came here in a time machine, the one at the museum. Just tell me what you want. I want the truth, not this cock-and-bull story! And we're going to stay here until I get it! Lieutenant, take a look at this. That's right! That's it. Take a look! Take a look, you cretinous idiot! This is tomorrow's bloody paper! You see what it says? You see what will happen if you don't listen to me? Listen to me! Mr. Wells or whatever your real name is you know as well as I do that novelty shops will run off a phony newspaper edition for you if you pay them 3 dollars. Now, you may have been born yesterday but I certainly wasn't. Now, where did you get the gun? Herbert? Herbert? You want to break for dinner? 'Hey!' I'll strike a bargain with you. I confess! I'll confess to anything you like! I killed them! I killed them all! Now, please. Please, please, send a car to 2340 Francisco. 'Send a car, and I'll sign whatever you want.' You're free to go. I'm sorry. 'Please, believe me. I am truly sorry.' 'Herbert.' 'Herbert, I'm over here.' 'He murdered Carol, my friend from work.' 'I forgot I invited her over for dinner to meet you.' - Amy? - 'He's got the car.' 'Amy!' The newspaper was wrong. Amy! Not so fast. We have a little unfinished business. What more do you want? 'You know what I want. Give me the key.' And you get the white queen. Alright. Alright. 'You let her go, and I'll throw it to you.' Oh, no. 'My mother was rather an atrocious woman' 'in her way, but her many failings did not include' 'raising mentally deficient sons.' You throw me the key, and I'll release the girl. On your honor, John? You have my word as a gentleman. Now, there's just one thing. I would have expected that you'd noticed by now that I am not a gentleman. 'Say goodbye.' Goodbye, Herbert. You know where we're going. You haven't instructed him in the use of one of these machines, have you? Go faster, please. Go faster. If I go any faster, I'm gonna wrap us around a phone pole. Herbert! Stevenson! Stevenson! What is it, H.G.? You're becoming extremely tiresome. The girl. Which girl? Oh, you mean this one. Let her go. Please, I beg you. 'You can afford to be magnanimous.' Women throughout the centuries are yours for the taking. Is it so important? Frankly, I don't find her especially attractive. Do you? Now, you're not about to disagree with me, are you? - No. - "No" what? No, I don't find her particularly attractive. Well, shall I cut her throat right now, then? No, please. John, you and I, we were friends once. I admired you. Now, what are you babbling about, Wells? Really, you've become quite an old fool, haven't you? Yes, yes, I am an old fool! I know nothing. And she means that much to you? Yes. Please.. I'm sorry. H.G., it's checkmate, and you've lost again. Herbert! A-a-ah! 'What did you do?' I sent him to where he belongs. Infinity. That's the last anyone will hear of Jack The Ripper. Now, it's time for us to say goodbye before the police arrive. You're going back? Why? I've got to dismantle that machine, for one thing. Until we master ourselves, we have no proper use for time. And then I've got all those books to write whatever they are. Fiction, I hope. Every age is the same. It's only love that makes any of them bearable. And finally.. ...I must go back because that is where I belong. And my life is almost as important to me as yours. Not quite. Almost. Herbert! You wait for me! You wait for me! You wait for me! Herbert! It isn't life without you. Please! Look at me! Oh! Now, just don't expect miracles. I'm changing my name to Susan B. Anthony. Let's go.
