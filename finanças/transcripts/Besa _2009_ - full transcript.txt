Inspired by actual events Professor Filip Simic was appointed headmaster of a school in the south of the Kingdom of Serbia He brought his wife Lea with him, a native of Slovenia, then part of Austro-Hungary, How many beds have we had? This is the fourth, not counting Vienna, Why not counting Vienna? Well, that was the first time we slept on the floor, Ah, funny... Don't, - Don't... Don't! Oo we have an iron... mister headmaster? What? - An iron... you know, to press things?! An iron, we call it an iron, We call it an iron too... An iron, iron... You've arrived?! - Do mind the glass, please, What's the name of that school attendant? - Azem, Azem, have you by any chance seen the iron? There, you see, an army trick... press the stitches together, You're so... They won't really...? Surely they can't be that mad? Emperor Franz Joseph and Austro-Hungary have treacherously declared war on the Kingdom of Serbia, Therefore, brothers and sisters, the proclamation reads: We, Peter I, King of Serbia, have decided to put our entire army on alert! Don't ler them get Belgrade, son! Don't be afraid, not every bullet hits its mark! Take Vienna, damn their eyes! Take both Buda and Pest! Hurray! Down with Austria! - Down! Down with Emperor Franz Joseph! - Down! Azem, take this suitcase in first, and then make room between these books, so we can pass, And then we'll finish later, I came to fetch the globe, mister headmaster, My daughters would like to know exactly where Vienna is, Summer holidays, can't help it, I've been urgently summoned to the war effort, Wonderful, congratulations, - I thought I'd ask you... to keep an eye on my Lea until I return, I don't know if that would work, we've only just decided to paint the house... Please don't think I have a problem with her being a... Sorry, I'm in a rush, You're not going anywhere, I won't allow it, I'll come too, - Everything is going to be alright, But don't speak German around here, please, I'm sorry Azem, you can go, Oh, Serbia, you sweet mother, I will never have another... Filip! Filip where are you? What should I pack? What am I going to do here without you? I don't know anyone here, I'll probably be back soon, and Azem has promised to look after you, I trust him, I don't need anyone, I'm scared on my own and I speak Serbian, What's this? - No idea, What is it, Filip? - I don't know, Shame on you, -You see you're afraid of everything, Take care of the school and wait for me, How about I come with you after all? No... And promise me you won't cry, - I won't, You can bring your family over too, There's enough room at the school, - Never mind, My sons and brothers are looking afrer... The land, livestock, Thanks again for agreeing to do this, I know what trouble is, mister headmaster, Good day... Filip told me you'll be looking after me, The key... You know, the key... that opens and closes the door, if I need it? Mane comes, Why did you lock me in? Where did you get the key? You can't do that, I'm not a prisoner, you hear?! Good morning, Please give me back the key, I must lock the apartment, And then call for the coach to take me to the station, I hope the trains are still running, Sure, the furniture can stay... I'll be back, just like Filip, It's better for you too, what do you need me for anyway? This is not right, shame on you! Open up! Run... Run...! Stop, you thieving scum! Thank you kindly... And thank you for driving the thief away, Go on, breakfast... You've earned it, Go on, sit down, Have some tea, It's gotten a little cold, but I have no coffee, I have some biscuits from Belgrade, I hope they're still good... Nice, Go on now, give me the key... Ah, you talk, nice, Do you ever go home, do you have a wife, children? Surely you don't live in the school? Now it's... the Besa that lives, What is Besa? Explain! I've had enough, I'm going to Belgrade to look for Filip, You could've knocked at least, Understand? Good day, Brothers and sisters, in the name of His Majesty Peter I, I report that our brave army has defeated the Austro-Hungarians! The remnants of the enemy army are fleeing... Everything will be over now and Filip will be back soon, Long live Serbia, long live king Peter...! Forgive me, I forgot, you people don't drink, Long live Serbia! But why? I'm not... I'm Serbian now, an Orthodox Serb, When I got married I learned to cross myself like this, with three fingers... In fact I'm Styrian, Slovenian, We don't much like Vienna either, Shoo, madam... shoo! That's where I met Filip and... There's no Iight...! Azem!' Here, take it, take it all leave me alone and let me walk for a bit... Forgive me, I didn't mean... Open up, it's us! Grandma sent you something to eat, She remembered, at long last, Hello, my name is Lea Simic, What are your names? They're your sons, right? Grandsons, Come in... Fine... If I'm a prisoner, then I want to hold the key! Open up, woman! Austrian women don't wear head scarves either? She's not Austrian, Go home, What should we bring you next time? Some meat, milk, cheese, if there's any, Give your grandma a hand if she needs it, All right, al right... I'll give you the key back, but I want to walk! All right... A walk is fine, Good day, No! I'm not going anywhere, I don't have a suitcase... I'd have to go to the post ofice to check if there's a letter from Filip, They probably don't have anyone to deliver mail, You can come along, I don't mind, There, Fine, Just, don't follow me like a... Stay here, Understand? What did we agree on? Don't be afraid, Frau, you'll be fine, I'll go first, big guy! Albanian bastard! Forgive me... Thank you, thank you so much, Ah, What's the matter now? I can untie this whenever I like, Fine, fine... Serbs have a saying: honour everyone, credit to no one, That's how it is, I can't go without... A wedding gift from my parents, Look, this goes first, then that... You put this here, Put the needle there, at the beginning, Schubert, Gretchen sits at her spindle and sings about feeling as though she were in a graveyard, Her beloved is gone, life has no meaning anymore, ir becomes hard and bitter, Goethe, Again, - Never mind, go to sleep, Why is Filip not writing? You know he hasn't even sent me his army post ofice number? Go to sleep, I don't like it that they're coming down this way, They should fight up there, Maybe it's the postman? Mrs Simic, it's me, open up! I'll be right there! Now you'll let me go or else... Untie me, please, I'll be right back, Honest, How nice, I was expecting the postman, I am a kind of a postman... Take this globe first, I'm returning it, Your Filip sent me a letter for you, I guess he was afraid, you know what people here are like, but I'd mislaid it... Wonderful, I was getting really worried, Here is some, my younger daughter had a birrhday, Just watch it doesn't get wet, - Thanks, you shouldn't have, It's nothing, Here's the letter too, Thank you very much, do call again, The headmaster says Azem is looking after you, I can't see him, He's doing chores around here, I don't see much of him, Aren't you afraid of him? - Not in the least, That's because you're not a Serb, I'd be dead frightened, Goodbye, Three of his letters returned, and the fourth arrived, Incredible, It won't end soon, Looks as if they're attacking again, If our boys win now... Who are our boys? - The Serbs, of course, If our boys win now, I'll start teaching, If they don't, he says to ready the children to evacuate, But what matters is he's all right, he's working at the Ministry, And he still hasn't sent me the number of his army post ofice, Lovely, carry on, No, Go on, take it, It's delicious, Oo you have a granddaughter or a daughter perhaps? Yes, Three what? Daughter, two grandsons, granddaughters, So, you have two granddaughters, two grandsons, a daughter and at least two sons? Three, - And a wife? -Yes, How many of you are there? Many, Brothers and sisters, I'm informing you that our brave army has fiercely routed the enemy and forced them to retreat in chaos... The school is starting, Go on, pupils, When the war is over, I'll only teach you gymnastics and dance, I don't speak Serbian so well, but I am a Serb, Quiet, children, listen to the madam, And when you go home, tell your mums to put petroleum on your hair, - Yikes! - Why? Because ofthe lice, So they won't have to cut your hair, I've read you learned the dance of the Sun and Moon, Yes, All right, let me see what you remember, Who was what? Quiet there, girl, I can see you! The Sun, - The Moon, - Little star, Very well, Sun and Moon come over here and show me what you've practised, Arms up... and now wide... The sky is great... Lice are a peril because of typhoid, and the children... Good? Good, Very good, Come, I'll rub petroleum on your head too, Don't be afraid, lice can get in your hair, Think I'll bite your nose off if I touch you? Yes, Mister headmaster my dear husband, if they don't want to study, they don't have to, It's war, who could study? At least I will be of some use, A, B, V... You know it? I work at school, Azem, - Excellent, Slovenia, Styria, That's where I'm from, and you're from... here, That's very close, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to touch you, Mrs Simic! Lieutenant Jevrem Stoiljkovic, I have orders to requisition a certain amount of your stock for the needs of rhe Second Army, Here's the warrant, Very well, but... What if the pupils return? Madam, people who are prepared to get killed must eat, What about the pupils, I asked you? The pupils eat at home, with their families, Of course, I'm being silly, Help yourself but I don't think the army will overeat on this, Lale, let's go, There's so little there, Move it! - Let them, Azem, we'll survive, Is that your Albanian? - Yes, that's my Albanian, sir, if that's all right with the army of Kingdom of Serbia? The army doesn't mind, madam, if you don't, - Not at all, Especially since no one else was willing to look after me, He's dangerous, one should be cautious with him... You'd let them shoot at you? He got a point, He's a nice gentleman after all, Well, his head is a bit too big, but... Have you seen his gloves? He looks a bit like a waiter, Ifonly I could send some food to Filip, Come here, Here, have some, You shouldn't be afraid of this lieutenant, I know how to handle his kind, Go on, eat, It'll get cold, What was that? It's not... And I already thought that... I really am tend to panic, Children? I don't know, At first we were in no rush, we said there was plenty of time... Then I couldn't, or he couldn't, I don't know, science will say all sorts of things... I don't rhink all people have to have children, Why then...? I don't know... just like that, Whar did the wedding mean for you? An ox, a load of corn, 4 measures of cofFee, 4 sacks of wheat, 4 measures of honey, 8 measures of rice, 10 measures of cheese, 12 measures of sugar... Thanks, that's enough, But is there love between you? - Yes, She serves, she guards my honour, she feeds the children... - Yes, but do you love her? Of course, I guard her honour and I look after her, Thank you, but I don't wear that, it prickles, Take the sugar, even though we're running low, Thank you... I'd already forgotten the taste, I feel so European somehow, even without the "Europe" tavern you've invited me to, Does he have to sit here? He does... You don't have to, but he does, Don't be cross, madam, you're too much of a lady to be cross, Thanks for the compliment, but I am no lady whatsoever, I am a schoolteacher please get to the point, What are you staring at me for? You know, we don't draft them, we don't trust them, They don't trust you either, Have you ever wondered why that is? Would you mind using German so he can't understand us? I wouldn't, but how do you know he wasn't delivering coal in Vienna as a child, with his father? Albanians haven't learned where Belgrade is yet, let alone Vienna, - I was joking, you're Austrian? No, I'm Slovenian, Styrian, to be exact, married to a Serb and a citizen of Serbia, everyone knows that, What they call Slovenia today is in Austria, until we've liberated you, Do you have telephone? How would we? We don't even have power, I'll be candid, People in town suspect you're... You're working for Austria, Me? How? With carrier pigeons? I don't know, madam, This is just a friendly chat, No, I don't keep animals, alrhough I'd like to have a dog, a mad and dangerous one, who'd hunr down and bite stupid informers and the oficers who listen to them, Please don't be like that, I'll write and complain to King Peter himself, just so you know, - How come you know His Majesty? I met him at a ball held by the Circle of Serbian Sisters at the Oficers' Home in Belgrade, And he used to play cards often with my husband, This is just a petty thing, That nice gentleman should be aware of what his oficers are like, I don't know King Peter at all, I've only seen him once, from afar, He was very sweet, I even hear people call him Uncle Peter, I really have a big mouth, tell me to be quiet, Be quiet, Easy, easy! What's going on here? The lieutenant has kindly decided to move to the school, Azem, give these people a hand, - Go on, take this! Hear what I'm saying?! Arrest him! - He's my orderly, he can't go anywhere, They're here for Uncle Peter, - Be quiet, We could do an act at a cabaret together! I won't touch you, Let me have a look, This is like a guitar, Coming down the stairs, Climbing up the stairs, Birds flying, birds flying... Thank you, but I don't know... Hello, my babies... Come here, come here, And what's that? - Milk, milk, These are your granddaughters, or...? This is not an animal market, Get off! Lale, let them go, Get back here, Madam, - Thank you, Lieutenant, sir, Always at your service, especially since you convinced me you were not a spy, That's right, that's right, And you have to enrol them in school, all of them, It's a shame your granddaughters do not go to school, Why don't you take Filip's soap and add some hot water? Makes it easier, they say, Mrs, Simic, it's me! Come! I only have two left, so I thought... Thank you, you shouldn't have, Here, a chicken... You wouldn't by any chance have a letter from Filip for me? No, unfortunately... You two look like a married couple,You have children, goat... That's not funny at all, When are we going to do gymnastics and dance? Right away, love, - Lieutenant was saying such nice things about you at dinner with us last night, He says there are very few women like you in Serbia, Very nice of him, - Why don't you move in with us? It would be much more comfortable, -Thanks, bur... Azem wouldn't let me alone, I'd have to bring him along, I'm sorry, but that couldn't be, unless he stayed in the yard, He's not my dog, - He's not your husband either, Hands up... that's right, Back straight... and smile, Good, good... That's right, that's right... Lovely... Take your time, Could I join you perhaps? Soran Simonesku, The Dance of the Sun and the Moon, if I'm not mistaken? - Yes, We continue The Dance of the Sun and the Moon, Nice and easy, You two as well, Where do you get your gloves? In Vienna, Unfortunately, I only have two pairs left, He's a genius, listen, As soon as Andrei put his arm around this rhin, slender waist... He means Natasha Rostova And as soon as she swayed so close to him, and smiled at him from so close, the wine of her charms dazzled him, He felt invigorated and rejuvenated, Stepping away and leaving her, he paused and looked at the ones still dancing... By god, you either don't look at all, or when you look, you really look... Go on, we should go to sleep, Good night, Sweet dreams, You know that too? Nice, I've never danced so well before, Oo you know the one about Franz Joseph, Emperor Nikolai Il and a camel meeting in a casino? How could they possibly have met in a casino? Well, they went to Monte Carlo to gamble, So, the camel sees Franz Joseph is cheating... Thank you, that's enough, Can I have one of those? I love cigarettes, but Filip doesn't like them, Offer one to Azem, He keeps puffing at that rhing of his, I don't know the Serbian word for it, Here, take one... See, they don't really know what a cigarette is, They do, they don't want them, Pantomime, A man walks, A man walks down the stairs, A man climbs up the stairs, Birds flying, birds flying, I can't keep silent anymore, You're a small woman, bur also the most wonderful creature I've ever seen, I can't find the words to describe my feelings for you, Forgive me, I had to tell you this so that this one doesn't understand, Get ofF, you scum! Fool! Azem, let him go! Oon't you ever dare try to lay a finger on this nice lady, you immature wretch! I'll kill you like a dog if you only try... I was wrong, At least tell me why you did it, Oon't look at me like that, You have such eyes... God, It doesn't matter if you did it for him or for me, or... We'll just say goodbye now, You'll go to your family, and I'll move in with the teacher, - No, You can always find me there, - Mustn't be... The Besa, Be quiet, Ah, mister Albanian is here! You can't! - We can do it a lot worse too, He'll see yet! We really missed you! Move, animal! Our father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name... Jevrem Stoiljkovic! The hospital will move in with you, madam, Fine, it should, And tell that lieutenant to call me, or I'll go to King Peter, even if I have to walkthere, Shame on him, some oficer he is! We'll do what we can, Very well, Major, sir, We'll do even more than we can, Yes, sir! Come on in, Mrs Simic, Your Albanian has assaulted an oficer Of the King and martial law is clear, Therefore... - May I sit down? Of course, I apologize, Make it quick, please, And what would martial law have to say ifthey knew you tried to, excuse me, to rape me? What you're saying is completely untrue, I don't know how complete it is, but maybe it's not... But whose word would the military court and King Peter believe, yours or mine? I have had a bit to drink, and I relaxed a bit, bur that's everything else but... To my own misfortune, I, the fool, fell in love, I deeply regret it now, It's nice of you to regret it, but you're no child, Madam, I might get killed every day, The front line is getting closer and you're distracting me here because of some Albanian, Can you see my position? I can if you set him free, That's out of the question, You were flirting with me too, You have to admit that, You reminded me of my baby brother, that's why I was fond of you, I know he pledged Besa, a solemn oath to your husband to guard you and protect you, but he's a villain and I cannot let him go, You know, I could start screaming and say you're trying to take advantage of me this minute, Me? What are you talking about? I'm sure at least someone would hear me, Would you like me to try? You really are an incredible woman, That won't save you, Let him go, I can't, no way, And what what'd you say if I pointed a finger at the citizens who wanted to rob me, who broke my windows and really did want to rape me? And it was Azem who saved me, not your army, Who are these people? You want to send them to military court too? - Of course! Leave the military court be, you have better things to do, Fine, I'll let him go, - I don't believe you, I'm a Serb, madam, and I can't pledge Besa to you, I can only give you my word as an oficer, Backo, let the Albanian go this instant, Never you mind, just let him go, give him his weapon, I don't want people to talk, Nothing happened, you fool... It doesn't matter, we really don't need a shooting... Go on, Our courier has brought you a letter, He says it's urgent, I doubt it's from King Peter, Madam, you forgot something... Tell me honestly, which do you prefer, women or war? My fatherland, - And after that? Women, of course, I don't like war, What have they done to you, for God's sake? Good night, Filip is coming, We have to take the children far away, Serbia is done with, Thunder? Cannons far away, by the river, What do we do now? Why don't you get in bed with me here? It's stupid for you to still suffer there, on the floor, Can't be, That doesn't mean anything, You know how many times I've slept with my brother's friends when we went skiing and nothing happened, Nowadays men and women can sleep together only as friends, Look, I'll be here, and you there, on that side, Piece of cake, Go on, don't be all coy, like a woman, Just don't look at me like that and everyrhing will be alright, Maybe I should disinfect these wounds after all, I have some iodine and balm, God, what would that be? We've checked the list, you go home now, pack their things, dress them warmly, but no more rhan one change of clothes, They'll get everything they need there, When are you leaving? When Filip, mister headmaster, says so, And when the army says so, Calm down, people, calm down! They'll be fine there, They'll be safe, they'll see the sea and the sun, They'll be saved and they'll come back to you, alive and well, Do they have a post ofice there? -They do, Wejust don't know where they're sending us, Let us get to the sea and the allies first, You won't go through Albania? - I don't know, maybe we will, In this cold weather? What will they eat? Ifyou have to, it's not... - Hard, - Hard! Is that how the saying goes? - It is, Bombs will not fall where a votive candle burns, I had a sheep dog, A good guard it was, big, strong, I had no worries when it was on the meadow, Not a single sheep could get lost, Then, one day, the dog got lost, I drove the sheep to the pen, I turned, it was gone, As far as I know, it was dark, I called,I searched, no use, It's like it vanished into thin air, The next day, me, my brother and children looked for him, we went to the woods, we went to the neighbours, the Serbs, the Turks, the Gypsies, no use, Then I forgot about him, I found two little dogs, its offspring maybe, and so little by little, the sheep got used to them, Then one day, he appeared, I don't know where from, out of nowhere, he showed up, It licked my hand and sar down, watching, I was happy, I took it to the sheep, it didn't do anything, The sheep weren't afraid, it wasn't barking, nothing, For one day, for two days, three, Where had it gone, why did it leave, what did it see? No idea, And a dog can't talk, It was very sad, just the way a man is sad, Do you know I'm a bit like that dog of yours? - Be quiet, You talk so nicely, Why haven'r you talked before? Be quiet, Now I know what Besa means, Some looking after, no joke, I couldn't write to you, - Hey, we'll talk on the way, What matters now is that you're alive and well, Almost a year and a half, How are you, everything all right? Everything's all right, mister headmaster, What's that? - They've beaten him, He was defending me, Let's make a toast for a kept Besa, And for everything going well, at least here with you, How do you say cheers? Thank you, Azem, Filip? I'm sorry, I'm already running late, Let's say goodbye, We've never even shaken hands, and now there's no more Besa, Now you're allowed to touch me, It's better this way, Fine, Please take out the remaining things, Let's go, children, Cheerfully! We are crossing the field, the field, we are crossing the field... And the clouds are crossing the sky, the sky, and the clouds are crossing the sky... Serbia was soon to be conquered by Austro-Hungary, Germany and Bulgaria, Serbian king, army, Government and a part of the people saved themselves by retreating through the mountains of Albania, Lea and Filip were to be transferred first to Corsica, and then, with their group of pupils, to the south of France, Until the end of the WWl they held classes regularly, at the Bellevue Inn in the town of Antibes, After liberation, Lea and Filip returned to Belgrade and had a daughter, Milena, They never saw Azem again, who quit being the school attendant and continued to live in his family cooperative, Lieutenant Jevrem Stoiljkovic was killed northeast from Skadar (Shkod?r) shielding the wirhdrawal of Serbian troops through Albania, English translation: Marija Stojanovic Ellen Elias-Bursac
