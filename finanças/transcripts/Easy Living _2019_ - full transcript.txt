Let's go. But... What about my helmet? Damn, the helmet. Hey, hi. -Hi, Cami. -Is that Pietro? Yeah. Where is he going now? He's leaving. Bastard. Damn bastard! Pietro! Where are you going? What does it mean? No, I really need to leave today! Come on, please. Brando I'm sorry, I don't remember. Could you please remind me where did mom go? Mom is... in India, something about yoga. Oh yeah, that's right, ok. It's been a month now. Don't you have to go to school? I'm on vacation now, Cami. What vacation? Mardi Gras. Mardi Gras? What kind of vacation is Mardi Gras? -It's Mardi Gras. -Since when do schools celebrate that? Since always. I don't know what to do. I mean, I could go with you. Do you even know what I do for a living? You're a prostitute, right? Brando, are you nuts? What's got into you? How can you even think your sister is a prostitute? What's your job then? I work in the Import-Export business. Import, expert? What's that? I smuggle alcohol... cigarettes... and medicines. You mean... normal medicines? Yes, normal medicines. Paracetamol, painkillers, syrups... But, first and foremost... the blue pill. That's how you make big money. Ventimiglia is full of old people. And... why are you going all the way to Ventimiglia? Because it's on the French border. Oh... I see. You do contraband. You're a pirate. But not a whore! I can't believe this. What a family of assholes. Forehand... ...and backhand, yes, that's perfect. Forehand. The last ball. And the very last one now! Yes, yeah. An excellent first lesson, Mrs. Lucia. Thank you. Why don't you enroll for next week's tournament? I could try. You really play like a Sagittarius. How did you guess? Tennis is only a pastime for me. I'm a painter. I'd really like to make a portrait of you one of these nights. By the way, how is your wife? Carlo, my wife has been dead for a year now. Oh yeah, you told me that. Do me a favour, Eric. I have a new student tomorrow, right? Would you read me her info? Sandra Conti, divorced. Born June 13, 1962. "Gemelli". Come here. That's France. That? It's real close. It looks just like Italy. Andre, you're a loser. Oh, gosh. The fault is yours. You drive me crazy! -Camilla. -Yes. I ordered two boxes of blue pills. Yes, I've got that. You give me 40. Excuse me, Camilla. My belly aches, do you happen to have a laxative or something... That's gross, Gloria. We're talking about serious stuff now... We're here for the blue pill. You guys are so miserable. Come on... You should just shut up and make a reservation first, like everyone else does. How the hell did you guess I was a Gemini? It's quite apparent. When are you going to make my portrait? -I'm counting on it. -See you very soon. Very pretty. Her name is Camilla, she's from Milan. She comes here every month and she sells medicines. She buys them in France because they're cheaper, then she sells them here and earns a percentage. I get my syrup for free. Hush. Can you bring me two boxes next week? Yes, anyways tomorrow I'll be here again... -What a life we have... -What? What a life we have! Let's switch our shades, mines are letting the sunrays though, I can't see a thing. Cami. Cami. There's a guy staring at your tits. Who the hell is he? How can he swim with such a cold water? Wait, that's the tennis teacher at the club. Who? The club's tennis teacher. I saw him there today. No... He's coming here. Hi. Hello. I'm Don, by the way. I teach tennis here at the club. If you want a lesson, boom! In beautiful Italia! Do you need anything? "Aspirin"? Yes, aspirin. I heard you sell medicines. I'll be on court four, always. See you, alright? Bye. Children! Look at this. It's all over town, you like it? No, it sucks. It's really horrible. It's not that bad, come on. No, all these mixed colours, I don't get it. We used one of Don's paintings. Ah, Don! Hey, Don. Look at this new reprinting. The print could have been better. But it's nice. You like it? -Yes. -Yes, very much. Congratulations, it's really nice. I painted it. -Good job. -Congratulations. Give me a hand. Camilla! Thank you. Camilla! Camilla! -Who's that? -Elvis. -Elvis Presley? -Yes. I thought Elvis Presley was different. -Hi Camilla. -Hi Elvis. Hey kid, how are you? -Brando, nice to meet you. -Elvis. -He's my brother. -Step-brother, actually. Step-brother, sorry. How about you? How come you're still here? I tried to go through last week, but it didn't work. They caught Ruben. Do you have cigarettes? You do. Yes, I have cigarettes. You can keep it. Here. Thank you, Camilla. Hey, don't smoke, uh? Ok, we have to go. What is he doing here? He's waiting to cross the border. But there's a lot of people like him. They want to go to France. Where's the border? Brando, it's right there! There, Brando. I mean, the border you were talking about yesterday is that lame? Yeah. Here comes the dope! Here it is. My little Camilla. -Hi. -Hi. Good. Here's your share, old man. -Tell me. What do you need? -What? A couple of things. Paracetamol, six. Ibuprofen, four. Herecto, a dozen. Herecto, Herecto, bless you. Here it is. Faster tablets and Svevodol, two. Procopin, Mauriden 1000, do you have that? And Nitalogram, one. Dysent-herbal, one. Giamental effervescent, four. Nikifex, one. Gianoprim syrup. Alfaspeed... All you've got. All... I've got one. Ok. Take it! Come on! You André Agassi wanna-be. Come on! The magic fist. Bye Don. Aspirin. Aspirino. -Merci very grazie. -You're welcome. Could I talk to you for a second? -Yes. -Just the two of us? Yes. How should I put it? It may look like tennis is what I do for a living, but that's not me... Not the real me, you understand? My real world is different and I'm... I'm a painter and I'd really like to make a portrait of you one of these nights. I don't fully understand what you're saying. I was speaking Italian. Right. What would you say if I invited you for dinner tonight? We really can't tonight. Maybe tomorrow? Now we really have to go. Bye. Hi Elvis. Hi! -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. Anything to declare? No, nothing. Ok, go. -Thank you, bye. -Have a good day. Damn, what a babe, uh? Here I am. Shall we? Just a minute. Come on Brando, I'm begging you, I'm starving, please, let's go. -I have to wait. -What for? My cell phone. Your phone? I lent it to Elvis for a second. -To Elvis? -Yeah. Brando, what the hell are you doing? I left you on your own for an hour and you just gave your phone just like that, to the first person who asked. He didn't ask me, I offered him. -Hey, pal. Thanks. -That's alright. -Really. -Did you manage to talk to her? I finally did, she's fine and so is the baby, so everything's fine. Thanks, you're awesome. -Hi, Camilla, how are you? -Fine, thanks. -It's getting late. -Let's go. -Bye Elvis. -Bye. You're the best. Can you tell me why you gave Elvis your phone? -You're jealous, uh? -Stop it. -You're jealous! -Brando, don't piss me off. There's no point in being jealous because Elvis is married. His wife is in Paris, and she's pregnant, about eight months pregnant. That's why he wants to... ...cross the border. She's in Paris. I see. But... Now, for instance... What? We just crossed the border, right? No problem, they didn't even ask for our IDs. So? Elvis, why don't we take him with us next time we cross the border? Well, that's easy to say. the problem is that he's an illegal immigrant. I mean, if we took Elvis to France and we'd get caught, you'd have to say goodbye to these excellent fries. Well... A raft, a disguise, I mean... A raft? What are you talking about? A raft! -What's the problem? The sea is dark. -What's this got to do with anything? Cami? Elvis is there. ITALIAN TOURIST OFFICE -Want some? -No thank you, it's all yours. Let's eat together tonight. We’ll take you to an American guy’s house for dinner. An American guy? What are you... Brando. What do you want? He'll finally have a decent meal and you'll have your nude portrait, right? Brando! What the hell are you saying? No. You are a bitch. It's all your fault, it's only your fault. You drive me nuts, you drive me crazy! Come on, Vittoria wait, wait. I was joking, I was joking. Ventimiglia Tennis Club. Yes. Yes, yes. Tonight? Yes, of course, sure. With a friend? Perfect. Hi. He's Elvis, our friend. Yes, that’s great. Welcome! Hi. Nice, is that you? Yeah. This is embarrassing, it's a self-portrait. Yeah, I'm working on it. Juice and wine, bread... My mother... Are you hungry? Yes. When I was three my father decided that my destiny was... to become the best tennis player in the world. So I grew up playing. No friends, no girlfriends, only tennis. Then, when I turned 21, I thought... "I'm 21 years old, I'm still a little virgin" Little virgin. "and... I don't have friends." "This can't be right." I said "Fuck it". I ran away... I wasn't happy. I was never happy. And now? Are you happy? Sometimes I am. You know, after a good day maybe I saw a good movie, or maybe I met a cool person, or I just painted a picture I like and I'm happy, and it was worth it. All of my choices... To increase your chances of having sex, talk to her as if you were sure that sooner or later you will really have sex with her. Imagine a time machine. Talk to her as if you had travelled through time and were sure you had sex with her. Maybe one of these days you can make my portrait. And never text back in a hurry, take your time. Bring her... a flower. A flower is never obvious. CALL NOW THE ART OF SEDUCTION I have to go to the club... I am going this way. You need a lift? Can this take me to France? No, I mean... Thank you for your hospitality, for the... food, for the best good night's sleep of these past weeks, for the shower. Thank you. Thanks again. Bye. If you want to, when you want to... Mi casa... Hi pal. If Camilla comes here, will you let me know? Even if I'm on the court. -Who? -Camilla, the medicine girl. -Camilla? -Yes. You finished your aspirins? How do you take a migrant to the other side? I like him. He'll rise from the ranks. I have known people who simply hid them in the trunk of their car, that's it. In the afternoon, when the policemen don't really feel like being too meticulous. If you are white, there is a 10% chance that they will stop you and check your trunk, one in ten. Well, what happens if you get caught? You go to jail. The bridge tournament has been moved to 5 pm, at the club bar. Excellent. She didn't come, pal. She did not? So will you make my portrait tonight? My husband won't be there tonight. Drop shot, run, run, run. Mamma mia, what a shitty life we have man. I'm gonna fuck off to America, Hollywood! America is right here, dickhead! Shit! They found me. I don't know how but they found me. The terrorists, the Libyans! Run, Marco! This is Camilla. It's Camilla. Yeah, uh... Do you like it? Well, sure. Don't... Don't tell her I'm painting her portrait, ok? Don't worry. Do you like... Camilla? No... Yes, she's... She's pretty. Why... do you like her, too? Of course I do. I don't know, actually I meant to ask you. I don't know if there's something between you two. No, you don't have to worry about that... don't worry. You... You are... I'm married. Cami? Let's help Elvis out. She's expecting a child, my wife. She's pregnant. I had the money for me, for her... to go on a "camion", how do you call it? A truck. Then the driver, when he saw her, he said: "You must pay for three". You know, because of the baby, and I didn't have the money. So I told my wife: "You go". And she went. Alone. She's fine. She's ok, everything's fine. The baby is fine. Now she's in France, in Paris, at her uncle's. Well, I don't know when I'll go, but... I'll go. I have to go to France as soon as I can. Have you heard, Franca? Last night they tried again to cross the border on the hill above the highway. Who did? Illegal immigrants of course. Two of them fell and died, Franca. Oh Lord. Yeah, sometimes it seems they ask for it, uh? You know. How can you say such a thing? They went through the "Death Path". -Where was Elvis yesterday? -I don't know. They died. Maybe they should stay put, I don't know. -Is that what you think? -Of course. Excuse me, it's just that... I heard you talking about the migrants who tried to pass... Was it up in the hills? There. By the highway. It's there. There there's an overhanging forest. On top of the hill. There, right there. -And the border patrols don't check there? -Well yes, at times... ...I was working. No, it's not ok. I mean, it's ok, but you left Elvis at my house, which is perfectly alright, but how should I put it, he lives with me now. Elvis was at your house yesterday? Yes, even this morning. I mean, I like the guy, everything's fine, but you guys disappeared. We have to take Elvis to France or chances are he'll get hurt. Let's take Elvis to France... Together. I'm a migrant too. I have to go, because I have a job to do now, and then I want to go check the border over the highway because that's where many migrants pass on foot, but maybe with a car it won't... You'll disappear again, right? No, but listen. Will you stay with Brando for a couple of hours, please? Brando as well now? This way you'll be sure that I'll come back, right? Do you know who that is? The tennis coach. -What a handsome guy. -Yes, very. He used to hook up with a friend of mine. I'll tell you who it is. It must be your sister-in-law. -What are you talking about? -Yes, yes. What the hell are we doing here? Pretty soon I will fuck off to America. Hollywood. You've kept saying this for 25 years! What will you do in America? Always talking about America. -What's the matter? -It's hot, it's damn hot. -Not even a car. -We're just losing time. Do your job. Be realistic. America is here. Work. There's a car. Do your job. -Yes my lord. -Yes. Shit. Your window. Please, turn your engine off. -Your ID, please, and get out of the car. -Yes. Here it is. Get out of the car and open the trunk. What have we got here? Alcohol. What's this? Cigarettes. Don't you have any personal belongings? Any personal belongings? André, come here. Look what she's carrying. I'll check the rest of the car. Are you an alcoholic? She does not speak French. -Ah, Italian. -Yes, yes. -Alcoholic? -No. Is it funny to you? -Sorry. -I'm just funny to you, right? -Found anything? -No. What should we do about her? We're not going to arrest her for a couple of bottles of booze plus the time we'd waste for the paperwork. Miss, that's not the kind of stuff we're looking for, but I can assure you that if I catch you one more time, you'll end up directly to the police station with me. -Did I make myself clear? -Absolutely, I apologize. -Alright, you can go. -Go ahead. -Thanks. -You're welcome. Classic Italians. "Enjoy: being profoundly happy." "Taking pleasure, experiencing sexual orgasm." Brando... How old are you? Do you have a girlfriend? Someone you like? There was a girl I liked, but... I'd rather not talk about it. "I'd rather not talk about it." Well, there was this girl I liked for a long time. And then, on the last day of school I tried to kiss her, but I didn't make it. What happened? Well... At one point it was just me and her, alone, so I said to myself "I have to kiss her" "so I'll count to three and then kiss her." I counted to three, then I counted to three again, again, like I counted to three ten times, until that twit, my friend called us and then I never saw her again. "Twit" is "pirlo"? "Pirlo"? It's "pirla". Next time don't count. No, counting is fine, but just once. Like: One, two, three. "Pirla". "Dumb and clumsy man". "Easily deceived and fooled". Here you go. 180. Goodbye. Why don't you fuck off. Don... What do you do all day? Well... I wake up and I cry, for no reason. I have breakfast, coco pops, rice crispies, special K, and I go to the club. There I meet Eric, my only friend, who hates me to death. I give lessons to over-fifty ladies who usually devour me with their eyes. Sometimes I sleep with them, sometimes I don't. Then I come back home and I paint. I wake up the following morning and I cry, for no reason. I can't complain. Look at you Elvis, for example. You had a life ten times harder and more painful than mine, probably. I had everything at birth. The only war I fled is in my head. I ran away from home, but I ran to my parents' vacation home. "Easy living". I always feel guilty for feeling so bad about my life, but... easy living is not that easy after all. Not for me at least. I'm throwing my life away, you see? We'll take Elvis to France. Water patrol! Help, help! Stop right there. Come, come here. What happens if we go overboard? Rejected. Then the easy way, in the trunk. Cosy and comfy? Don, you got to keep calm, ok? If you don't keep calm I won't either, ok? Go! Dammit, damn. We'll get arrested, that's it. We need a plan B... I mean, if something goes wrong, we gotta be able to pretend to be naive. "Oh no, we didn't know, no... the papers..." Then we'll just go through, at the border, and if they stop us we'll say that we knew nothing. They never stop you anyway. No, it's not true that they never stop me. Also, dammit, I'm white. Really? What if we use make-up to make Elvis white? I have the keys of the Tennis Club gate. Who wants to play? I'd really like to portray you... One of these nights for lunch or dinner... Hi. We'll take Elvis across the border and we'll take him by car. In the trunk? No, in the passenger seat. No, Don, are you drunk? We already talked about it, when they see him they'll ask for his papers. I'm sick of this shit. We'll put him on the seat and that's it. If they ask for our papers we're doomed, but I don't think they'll ask us at all. This is so crazy that it might work. The tournament, the tournament is our chance. The day after tomorrow people from all over the coast will come to play, Italians and French. The border will be super busy with people coming for the tournament. We'll all dress like tennis players. It's going to look as though we've just played and we go to France. Windows down and music as if we have nothing to hide, uh? What if they ask for our papers anyway? They hardly ever ask you, because they can tell immediately that you're not a refugee. Exactly. Look at Elvis, look at him. He just looks like a tennis player. Let's do it, but we should borrow the Tennis Club van, this way they'll link us to the tournament and be less suspicious. -When will you do it? -Tomorrow, during the tennis tournament. Better in the afternoon then. Stand by close to the border, ok? And wait for a van to pass, get in line right behind it. The van will certainly be stopped at the border and this will create a queue of annoyed drivers. The Border Police will be in a hurry and will let you pass. Everything will be fine, don't worry. Ok, let's go. I have two new players for the tournament! Good, you're finally helping out. But I have to go pick them up in Menton, tomorrow. So what? Can I use the club's car? That's my car. Yes, I should go and pick up the players in Menton tomorrow, but if you lend it to me tonight... No. Look, do you need it tomorrow? I'll give it to you tomorrow. You can come and get it here, ok? Hey dude, how are you? -Hi Don. -Hi. You are sure, aren't you? I don't know... This is outrageous! You can't drop the three if you don't have the golden three in the deck. My gosh, don't overdo it, you're exaggerating. I got it, try to have fun a little Don.. If you don't take chances there's no fun, right? Anyway... "Scopa"! How wonderful... Elvis... What’s the first thing you’ll do when you get to France? I’ll go to a café and ask for coffee in French. Coffee sucks in France, Elvis. No, we'll take you to a place where they make great fries. Much, much better than coffee. Great fries? Do you know that Don means priest in Italy? In America it's a nickname. For what? For Donald. No... My name's Donald. We have to go, will you wake up Brando? No, we can't put him at risk, Don. We thought it over. It's better this way. So you'll go get the car, I'll take Brando to the train station, I'll put him on the train to Milan, then we'll meet here, we'll get changed... and we'll go. Tell him I will see him again and that I'll always love him. Hey. Where's Don? We have to dress up as tennis players. What? What a bitch, such a bitch, I didn't even say goodbye to Don. Brando, will you please stop for a second? Listen to me. Will you listen to me? Stop. What the hell, you'll see Don again, we'll come see him. How can I leave if I don't even have my bags? I packed them yesterday and put them in the car. Can't I wait for you here? No, no, you can't wait here, you have to go to Milan, because if anything happens I'm not coming back here. I explained everything to Pietro, he'll come pick you up at the station. Now let's go, please. Fuck you, Cami. This is not a game, you know? Don’t you think I know that? You didn't even want to do it in the first place, I convinced you. I mean, I want to go with Elvis too, alright? I'm your friend too, right? Always. Always. But... you're not helping us now, you see? You are young. If they see us like this and if they see you with her, her life is over. Do you want to help? Go away. You understand? I understand. Give me a hug. Good boy. What if you don't see me again? Come here. I was joking. I'll see you tomorrow in Milan, ok? I shouted at Elvis, I didn't even say goodbye to him properly. That's not true, come on. And I promise you that if everything goes well, we'll go see him in Paris together. What if you get caught? It won't happen. Because I'm a pirate. Come here. Good morning, my name is Elvis, I would like a coffee. -Eric. -Don, what is it? Can I take the car, then? Actually no, pal. You promised. I didn't promise you anything. Please, it's one hell of a day today, leave me alone. Leave me alone, I'm begging you. Scratch it and I'll kill you. Done. Don, to the right, to the right, the border is there. One... Two... Three. Stop the car, Don. They'll stop us for sure. For sure. Stop the car, stop the car, Don! Get in the trunk. Follow that van. Now. Go, Don. Go.
