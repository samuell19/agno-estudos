We... are hiding our true hearts. Isn't that so, God. I know. The beginning and the end keep up with us behind our backs. THE RESONATING CHIME THE DISGUSTING EVERYDAY CAN'T BE HELPED EVERYONE IS WALKING FORWARD EARNESTLY ALL THESE BLANK NOTES EVEN IF BURIED IN GRAFFITI EVEN TODAY AGAIN I CAN'T STOP MYSELF SIGHING WHILE HOLDING THIS ANXIETY WITHIN WHILE ANTICIPATING THE FUTURE MY HEART SCREAMS OUT NO MATTER THE RULES YOU CAN'T BIND ME I'LL ACT ON MY FEELINGS I WON'T LET YOU INTERFERE NO MATTER THE COMMAND YOU CAN'T DISSOLVE MY DREAMS ANY ANSWER, EXEMPLARY OR OTHERWISE, WON'T MATTER I'LL SEEK THE ANSWERS ON MY OWN I CAN ONLY FIND THE ANSWERS MYSELF Popularity is rising for this mysterious masked band, 「in NO hurry to shout」. This is their song, 'High School'. Just like noises harmonize... as we got mixed together... love blossomed. FUKUMENKEI NOISE - ANONYMOUS NOISE Nino. Momo. Let's go home together. Okay. How's home life, now you're in 5th grade? They're still fighting over debt. I don't care if they decide to divorce. Look, Sakaki and Arisugawa held hands again! So embarrassing! Which of us should be embarrassed? No girls will hold your hands. Jealous? Pathetic. What'd you say? Let's run to the beach, Nino! You brat! Wait! Wait! You're running away! Run fast. Wait! Over here. - Brats. - They'd turn here. The beach! Let's hurry. Okay. So pretty. When I'm with you, I feel invincible. Hey, Nino. If ever we can't see each other again... Someday your voice will be the symbol that lets us meet again. Twinkle, twinkle, little star Listen while I talk. How I wonder what you are Up above the world so high Like a diamond in the sky Twinkle, twinkle, little star How I wonder what you are Momo. Momo. Nino. Momo moved away today. Moved? I can't see him anymore? Momo! Nino. Nino. No! It's okay. Momo! Nino. It'll be okay. Let me go! Momo... Nino. Momo! - No! - Nino, it'll be okay. I can't breathe. Disbanded?! Yeah. A rumour on Twitter says we may have disbanded. What the hell? You're joking, right? Who said so? Dunno. Our band info was in a magazine special edition. Right! Our TV appearance was announced too. Still, the debut song isn’t completed, right? That's right. If I can't write songs, we can't go on. We're at a halt. You're in a writing slump, right? Still, you have your girlfriend, Nino, to depend on. Huh? That's not how it is. I know your mind's only full of Alice from Yuigahama. I guessed right. Just stop. Alice? Yuzu. Yuzu! Yuzu, right! How are you here? Hearing that song, I knew! It's finished? Not yet. I'm halfway through. Eh? You really haven't changed, Yuzu. Your eyelashes grew longer?! No. All your nutrition went there? Same as always, you don't listen when I talk. I really can see you. Mm. I can't breathe. You stepped on my best music score. Eh? First time I've seen such a beautiful tune. Don't give empty praise. You can't even read it. I've found it. My voice. What's your name? Nino Arisugawa. Too long. I'll call you Alice. I'm Yuzu. Yuzu? I'll be here next Wednesday. Why don't you come again? Yuzu! Will this song reach Momo? Momo? He's a boy who lived next to us but moved away. Since the day he left, my breathing is painful if I don't wear my mask. He said my singing will let me see him again. I haven't seen him. I've not seen him at all. You will. Believe and just sing, Alice. If you feel you want to scream, you can sing my song. Then you won't need your mask. It's alright. You'll never lose your voice. Mm. This feels good. Aren't your eyelashes too long? Why won't you listen to me? Whenever I sing your song, the pain in me fades away. I was really happy back in those days. Thank you. Did you reunite with him? Who? That 'Momo' you talked about. I haven't reached him yet. Is my singing lacking? Don't say you still believe in that? That you'll see him by singing? What's strange? Nothing really. It led to something great. We met again. Eh? The Wednesday after that day, you didn't show up. Why? I'd been admitted to hospital. I could only sneak out Wednesdays. But I needed sudden treatment. Were you sick? It wasn't that serious. Anyway, who'd have thought you'd transfer here. You're right. I wonder if I'll see Momo again. Yuzu, where do you live? Over that way. Momo. Will 'sad themed music' work for you? I'm still working on this one. You don't really need to rush it. I gotta repay debts. A high schooler shouldn't be saying that. See you tomorrow at the office. You're so weak at this, Haruyoshi. Playing trump is boring! How? It's fun! Listen. I finished the song. What? You're over writer's block? That means the band's revival? Such a prolonged melody. Did you meet some girl? Not really. It shows on your face since way back. It's obvious when you lie. You're right. How about poker? Are you stupid? We gotta practise this. Play again! Just read this. Fine, I will. I met Alice. What? Alice from Yuigahama? Mm. Seriously? Which school does she go to? Surprisingly, our school. She transferred. What a freaky coincidence. Better keep it a secret from Miou. He's so easy to read, huh? Sorry about that. We can finally see Alice. I wanna be her pal. Kuro! Don't call her that. Only I can call her Alice. You look scary! Alice is Yuzu's muse, after all. That's not how it is. I don't care about her that way. Okay. Truth is, I hoped not to see you again. Because, when we met again... I'd surely fall in love with you. I love it! What? As always, I love your song. Oh, the song? I hope I can always sing this song. Till then. Here we go. Good afternoon. Studio C as always? C. Okay. Thank you. Sorry. Look where you're going. 「in NO hurry to shout」. 「high school」. MOMO KIRYUU Kiryuu...Momo. Momo! Could this be Momo? This is it, right? What's up? Miou is leaving the band. What? Now Yuzu is over writer's block? That's because he met Alice again, right? Yuzu. Even if I'm here, you can't compose, right? You can compose again because Alice from Yuigahama turned up. That's not it. I don't like lies. Reuniting with Alice means you can write again, right? I... Um... Excuse me. Alice. Alice?! What is it? We're in a meeting. You need something? It's fine. I can come back. That was Alice, right? What do you care? Don't try to hide it. Just the other day, you insisted on staying in the band. Why suddenly decide this? If you don't get it, too bad. Yuzu, you're so stupid. Miou... Wait up! You're sure about this? I am. Yuzu's muse showed up. I'm not enough for him. So quitting is right? I didn't want to be 「in NO hurry」's vocalist. I knew, deep down, he wanted her on vocals. You love him too much. Shut up. Leave me alone. I can't do that. What? Haven't I told you often? Forget about Yuzu. Choose me instead. That joke always makes me laugh. It cheered me up a bit. Thank you, Haruno. Alice! I'm so happy! First time meeting at the station. Why'd you look for me that time? I had shocking news! I found someone who seems to be Momo! This guy. Momo Kiryuu... it's him? That's right. I looked him up. He has the same blood type. I couldn't fathom why he'd compose songs for idols. But I remembered his mom's last name is Kiryuu. So Momo composes songs. I think I'll try out for this audition. If I get in, I might see him. Why are you here? You were with Yuzu that day, right? Kinoko, your voice is amazing. Kinoko? I'm Miou Suguri. Don't act close. Wait. I want to learn. What? How do I let others hear my voice? I want it to reach the world. Huh? To reach the person I like. Is that... - Yuzu? - It's Momo. These past 6 years, my singing didn't improve. But he said my voice will be the symbol for our reunion. That's why I sing. That's all? How shallow. Please. Teach me to sing. I want to improve. Sing out "aah" for as long as you can. I got it. Let's go. Get it? This is what you lack. Abdominal breathing. You lack breath from there. Your posture is wrong. Breathe longer for versatility. Your foundation is poor. Wait! Teach me abdominal breathing! I beg you! Please! Please! Cut it out. Please! Cut it out! I want to learn all I lack. I'll do everything to change. Please! Please! Please! Please! Wait. Go! 50... I did it! Okay, one more set. Let the sound out...Stop! Hold it. Hold it. Now breathe in. Okay, do it again. You heard me. Off we go. Nino, why are you so dedicated? I told you, it's so I can reach Momo. It's a while since I trained this much. Just when Yuzu's over his slump, you quit on vocals? Seriously?! Just when your TV spot is set. Sorry, Yanai. You know, I— Hey, didn't you want to go to Budokan? I can afford to go there myself. You're heartless. Miou is so cool. Kuro, no time for praise. There's no-one to replace Miao on vocals. C'mon, convince her. There is someone. You know who I mean, Yuzu. Truth is, you only want Nino to sing your songs, right? They are my songs... after all. See? You have the answer. Miou, wait! I said wait. This talk isn't over. Hey! What's this? Sound of waves? Momo. Don't you think that's an unforgettable voice? Was this recorded by the sea? Drop her. Why? No matter what. Wait, Momo. Miou. You're auditioning? That's right. No. 17: Ms. Toda. 18: Ms. Arisugawa. 19: Ms. Matsumoto. 20: Ms. Yokokawa. Follow me. Miou is my rival. Finalist, No. 18. This is Arisugawa's audition piece. No. 18: Nino Arisugawa. I'll sing 「in NO hurry」's 'High School'. The resonating chime The disgusting everyday Can't be helped. Everyone's walking forward earnestly... What happened to the audio? Momo. I told you to drop her. I wanted to hear her live. Momo! Momo! Momo, wait! It's you, right? Momo, it's me— Go home. You fail. I can't make money from your voice. What the hell? Momo. I don't sing just for that! I believed in your words. That's why I'm here to see you. Didn't you say it— My voice will be the symbol to let us meet again! Say something. Momo! Wait! Momo! Momo! Momo! Momo. Alice. You'll catch a cold. How was the audition? You met him, right? Momo. My singing... wasn't enough to stand out. I liked Momo such a long time. Even running and running, we can't run away from the past. I won't sing anymore. It's pointless. Alice. Running away from her voice was the only thing I couldn't do. You fail. I can't make money from your voice. Believe and just sing, Alice. The resonating chime... The disgusting everyday... It can't be helped Everyone is looking forward earnestly What's up? Where's this voice? All these blank notes Even if buried in graffiti Even today again I can't stop myself from sighing Yuzu! While holding this anxiety within While anticipating the future My heart screams out Haruyoshi! - What's up? - Dunno! No matter the command You can't dissolve my dreams Whatever answers, exemplary or otherwise, won't matter I'll seek the answers on my own I can only find the answers myself Kuro...Haruyoshi... Yeah...I get it. Sorry for this sudden message. Today 6 PM can you come to Shibuya Sound Studio A. 「in NO hurry」? You're 20 minutes late. Alice. Eh? You don't recognize me? You didn't recognize us. Let me do the introductions. I'm Haruyoshi on bass. Kurose on drums. People call me Kuro. And I'm on guitar. This is our new composition. What's this mean? For real? Alice. We want you as 「in NO hurry」's vocalist. But... If you can't reach Momo as you are now, use 「in NO hurry」. To have a professional career, becoming 「in NO hurry」's vocalist is your best platform. This is our new music. Sing it, Alice. These guys... calling me out on such short notice. Yanai, thanks for your work.

That's how we became a group. You compose music too? Despite your silly, long eyelashes. You're that guy... When will you stop studio recording and debut? Huh? The name's Yuzuriha. Don't call me weird names. Four Eyes. I'm Sakaki. Those are high notes. You can't sing so high, right? I'm not the one singing. I can't sing. You can't sing. We're the same. Wrong. Due to a throat disorder, I can't sing. Mmn. So what? It doesn't matter. I already found it. What? A voice that's mine only. I'm composing this for her to sing. Since I met her again, I'm overflowing with songs. At one time in my life, I thought that way too. Eyelashes. Let me hear your song. Huh? Let me hear it. Wait, hey! How's it sound? You're weird. What? You're weird! Shut up. Keep up. Ditto. You're a weird guy, for sure. Quit yapping. What should we do next? Let me see. How about the batting centre? I really hate that sort of pastime. Your body isn't flexible. It's Ninocchi. She's working hard. I'll keep shouting in this hoarse voice I will show you someday You're great, doing self-training. Are you nervous now the TV appearance is close? Mm. But, when I sing, everything disappears. Singing Yuzu's songs always makes me feel that way. I get what you're saying. Our band started to hear how Yuzu's music sounded. Even way before, he kept telling us about Alice from Yuigahama. What? You haven't heard? 「in NO hurry」's beginning was you. Me? Mm. What do you mean? That tune... Yeah. That tune from 6 years ago. Yuzu describes first meeting you as the best and worst thing in his life. Yuzu, from the day he met you, was unstoppably inspired. He was extremely excited. Yuzu kept insisting you should sing that song. Yuzu did? Yuzu can't sing due to a throat disorder. Eh? Yuzu most hates it when we make that face. That's right. Ninochhi, you reinspired him. Okay! We're on TV tomorrow! Gotta get hyped up! Mm. That's the spirit! You didn't get one true hit. I know. Watch! I'll get it now. Crap! Go for it. It's the machine's fault. Thanks for waiting. On stage is the trending band known as「in NO hurry」. Here's 「in NO hurry to shout」! The mysterious masked band are debuting on TV. Listen to them perform their new single, "Canaria." Cue.

I want you to have this, no matter what. Just for a moment, there was proof your voice touched Momo's heart. Yuzu! What's up? I have a guitar! Huh? A guitar! I know it's a guitar. So? It's Momo's guitar! What? When Momo saw me on TV, he recognised me. When he heard me sing, he reacted and damaged his guitar. Look, right here! It's due to you. You made me the "Alice" I am today. You let me sing for 「in NO hurry」. So I reached Momo even a little. Thank you. Mm. I can teach you guitar. Really? Mm. Start with chords of songs you want to play. Mm. I choose your song. Your songs are the ones I love the most. Gotta go. Sure do. When do I start learning? Well...lunch break. Got it. Music Room. Yeah. See ya. I've always sought your voice. Your grip is weak. Hold it firmly. Move your fingers. Like this, press hard. Eh? What? What's what? Eh! What? What? But as we get closer to each other, you get distant. Mm. - Here. - Mm, here. Hello. Hello. That's mine. What are you doing? Getting involved with 「in NO hurry」. Alice. You'll get cold. Alice? Alice! Sorry to wake you. I fell asleep. - Let's resume? - Mm. Hoi! Your first 'live' is set— 27th January, Toyosu PIT. - Seriously? - Great! Tickets are ready by— No way! Look at this! - At what? - What? This! PRODUCER MOMO KIRYUU NEW GROUP DEBUT They're a masked band... Their cat masks are like we had before? Silent Black Kitty. You know them, Yanai? The band name is good but the advantage is ours. They formed from that audition? I heard the vocalist is Miou. Miou? That information was withheld but I confirmed it with her. Being produced by Momo Kiryuu gets them lots of promotion. I support Miou but... it's nothing to do with us. That's right. We won't lose to this copycat band. Right! Okay, take it from the top! A 'copycat' band?! Yanai gives me the shits. You were mean not to tell us. I didn't want not to. We were told to keep quiet till it was disclosed. What's this tetchiness? I'm not tetchy! When I told Yuzu a while ago, I expected his congratulations. I thought he'd recognize my efforts. Joking! I'm stupid. I should've learned. Cut it out. Forget Yuzu. Be my girlfriend. That joke again. I'm fine. I'm serious. You'll help me forget Yuzu? Of course. And if I can't... What'll you do? If you're dissatisfied with my service, I'll give you a full refund! The heck! You're just messing with me! I like you. If only I have you... I won't need anything else. Become mine... Miou. Yuzu isn't here yet. Alice. Whoa. Sakaki! Yuzu...you know Momo? Momo? This is how our lives inevitably intersected. Momo, wait! Don't chase me anymore. You didn't wish to see me again? Yes, I never wanted to see you again. Don't talk to me anymore. You were actually Momo Kiryuu, huh? When did you find out Alice is 「in NO hurry」's vocalist and I'm composing the songs? When you appeared on TV. The voice...the song... I knew right away. You named her 'Alice'? It's a well thought-up name. Stop that. Only I can call her that. We won't lose to that Black Cat rip-off. You plan to stand on the same stage as me? I don't want to hear that from someone focused on earnings. You're right. I am so stupid. When Momo said that he liked me, I believed him. I believed he felt the same as me about reuniting after 6 years. I believed feelings I held onto weren't just one-sided. No matter what, it'd be fine. Deep down, I believed that. I'm stupid, right? There was no way such a dream could come true. Alice... Momo said he didn't want to see me again. And I shouldn't chase him anymore! Just when we reunited... When he was this close to me! When I sang my heart out to reach him! Alice. I don't know what to do anymore! See? Being startled stopped your tears. I should... go home for today. Hi. Hi. Whoa. So, are you hungry? What? Here. For 「in NO hurry」's 'live'. Why give me a ticket? I want you to hear Alice's voice— Alice molded by six years. Please. The person you spoke of that time...was Alice, right? Is it such a big deal? I've no right to see her... How long will you act cool? You thought of Alice whenever composing, right? I know you're inside! I'm here to get the money you owe me. Momo, let's sing! Twinkle, twinkle, little star... Nino's voice was the only light in my life. If she had lost her voice, I probably wouldn't be breathing now. So I decided, after I pay Dad's debt, I'd go back and see her. So that means you like Alice. Admit it. Thanks for the food. Thank you. What do you mean by that? I'm sure Alice lost her reason to sing for 「in NO hurry」. Staying in the band without Alice— I can't do it. What are you thinking? Tickets are distributed! We'll do the 'live'— probably our first and last. Snap out of it! I love your talent and came this far to play your music! Kuro! I can't let it all end this easily. Did 「in NO hurry」 mean so little to you?! Kuro! Haruyoshi, don't you think so too? To do this to us now... I'm sorry. Hey, hey! Kuro! Which school are you from? Where do you go? - Why are you here? - Why'd you come? I'm waiting for someone. Who is it? Who are you waiting for? Why are you here? Let's go. From the start, I composed music for you. But all the songs I treasured got sold off. Despite the arrogant things I told you, I made music for money. I didn't want you to see me that way. That's why you avoided me? I'm sorry I lied to you. I kept singing all this time so my voice could reach you. I wanted to see you for so long. I honestly wanted to see you badly. I never forgot you. Did my voice reach you at all? It did. This reminds me of the past. Mm. What's the matter? Nothing. Yuzu? Congrats! I'm happy for you. What? Your feelings reached Momo. Your dream came true. Thank you. It's all due to you. The other day, I talked to Yanai and the crew. What about? 「in NO hurry」... will make its first live gig its last. Why? Looks like my talent dried up. I can't write even one song. But... Even if the band continues, I’ll bother everyone... Why this sudden decision? What happened? No reason! But, Yuzu... Sorry. I've reached my limit. Yuzu! I've finished our final song. This is... The song from that day. It took me six years to write. Here. ( Close to Me ) You stepped on my best music score. First time I've seen such a beautiful tune. Aren't your eyelashes too long? Why won't you listen to me? I wrote this final song for you to sing at our last 'live'. It's my last present to you. 'Will this voice' 'reach you wherever you are?' 'Will this voice reach you wherever you are?' 'The song from that day' 'the song from that day' Nino. Momo. Why are you here? ( Find You ) This is... From now on, I want you only to sing my songs. 「in NO hurry」has its last gig tomorrow. To be honest... I was always jealous of you. Yuzu told me the truth so bluntly— Your voice is his own sound. Hearing that from him, I knew I can't win against you. Yuzu...has no-one but you. He only has you. If you don't want it to end this way... tell him properly yourself. If you don't want it to end this way... tell him properly yourself. Morning. Good morning. Good morning. Morning. Good morning. Where's Ninocchi? I called her. No answer. What's she up to? The 'live' will start soon. Thank you. So, what did you want to talk about? I can't accept this. I'm sorry. I thought of singing it but I couldn't do it. Yuzu's songs... After you left, I couldn't breathe properly but he made it easier. Yuzu gave me a place to sing my heart out. You go live today? Hurry and go. If you muck it up, I'll reclaim my place. Thank you, Momo. The song from that day. It's my last present to you. We want you as 「in NO hurry」's vocalist. If you can't reach Momo as you are now, use 「in NO hurry」. Congrats! Your feelings reached Momo. Your dream came true. Yuzu! Yuzu! Yuzu! Yuzu! What's Nino doing? When this could be your last 'live'. Yuzu! Alice. Yuzu... Listen... Yuzu...saying "cherish you" isn't enough to describe you in my life. I cherish you more than I value my family, my friends, myself and anyone else. For now and always...let me sing for you— your songs. Hoi! Talk later. Get ready! Come on! Let's go, Alice. - Hurry up! - Get here! Let's get the show started! Bunch of annoying brats. Everyone, thanks for coming! WILL THIS VOICE REACH YOU WHEREVER YOU ARE? THE SONG FROM THAT DAY I BELIEVE SO WHILE I SCREAM IT ALL OUT WE WERE ALL HIDING THE VOICE IN OUR HEARTS WILL THIS REACH YOU?

"Find You" by MAN WITH A MISSION * ending song ( Ayami Nakajo & Jun Shison ) Even now the memories are like puzzles Gently joining together and repeating The beginning breath, the endless spell, sleeping repeatedly Hold me so that I don't spill one of your memories Drowning in a foamy dream If we can meet again someday I chase after a fragment of dream I will find you Your voice is the signpost Oh let's play, I'll bring it to you some day Again Drowning in a foamy dream If we can meet again someday I chase after a fragment of dream I will find you Again I will find you Even if the world stops I am going to find you Again I will find you Even if the world stops I am going to find you Original Subtitles by FURRITSUBS (edited, and end song added, by Premamaris)
