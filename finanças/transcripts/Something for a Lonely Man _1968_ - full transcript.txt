( train whistles ) Train wreck! Train wreck. Hey, train wreck at Immigrant Pass. Whoa! Train wreck. Hey, train wreck at Immigrant Pass. Train wreck! I've seen it. It's beautiful. Hey! Hey, everybody, train wreck! RAFE: Hey, train wreck at Immigrant Pass. I've seen it, big old train wreck. Train wreck! Train wreck at Immigrant Pass! I saw it, boy. It was some... Beau... Crash! I saw it. Sure you did, Rafe, sure you did. Oh, she just shot into the air and then... Full--full down smashed into that pond. Smash! Down, down... Red and gold, silver. Breathin' under water, you know. There's a devil on me. I never did see nothing like that. The whole train? Tra-- No, not the train. What got wrecked? Nothin' got wrecked. Bleeck. Give the boy a beer. He's had an ordeal. I never did see nothin' like that. Here you are, Rafe. Cool your brain. What brain? Now, Rafe, just what was this shot through the air? A locomotive? Oh no! I know a locomotive. Sure you do. No, it was a big red and silver monster inside of a big box. Watch! He's comin' out of these woods, you know, and heading towards the meadow with these, uh, Indians peltin' her with arrows. Indians? Oh, they didn't mean nothing, they were just funning, but this here fireman, he must've be stoking up that locomotive cause'... Wee-ooo! He's bouncin', smokin', running like a rock downhill. He gets that bed, you know? Then all of a sudden, wee-ooo! Flies off that flat car, smack into Rock Canyon Pool. What did? What! This thing in the box. If it was in a box, how could you see it? Well, the box busted when it hit the water and that's when I seen it. Well, that's worth a round on the house. ( laughing ) I tell you. It's all red and silver and beautiful. And it was breathin'. Well, I've seen it. All--All right, you don't believe me, you-- you take back your beer. Ah, it's all right, Rafe. That was worth a nickel. No, no, no. You think I'm crazy, you take it back. I'll take it, Rafe. All red and silver. And it was breathin'. ( laughing ) You're the only one who didn't laugh. I don't laugh at people, Rafe. Told them and they laughed. Yeah. They think I'm crazy, don't they? Well, I reckon everybody's a lil' crazy one way or another. No, but they didn't believe me, that's why they laughed. Only you didn't laugh, did you? No, I didn't. It was so beautiful. All red and gold and shining. That a fact? Then, you believe me? Sure, I believe you. Oh! Now, let's call it a day, huh? ( horses trotting ) Swoosh! Crash! Ah, feeling the beat, that was just practice. ( footsteps ) ANGUS: Where you goin' in your good clothes? You mean that Killibrew can't read yet? Can you? Well, Mary, when a man gets to readin', he gets to thinkin', he gets to thinkin', he gets into a whole lot of trouble. What are you hidin' under that cloth, Sis? A blueberry pie and I'm not hiding it. I kinda thought we'd cut that up at around bed time. There's three more in the oven, you can have a whole one apiece. And one for John Killibrew, no doubt. Any objections? No, but still in all-- Still in all what? Well, you know, Mary, the whole town knows. I am asking him. Well, Mary, if it wasn't for crazy John Killibrew, we wouldn't be here. And this town wouldn't be here which is awful to be in, in the first place. As you well know, we followed him out here because he said the railroad was comin' after him. Well, here we sit and the railroad is 22 miles to the north. In a country as big as this, 22 miles is a very close miss. Ah, closer when he counts in horseshoes, Sis. See what I mean! Hold this. Even in horseshoes, close isn't always good enough. Sassy, ain't she? And something else. When a woman starts giving advice to a man, things is going on. Ah, it don't be nothin', Angus. Killibrew is like another brother. You want him for your brother? Well, not exactly. Well, that's what you goona get. She's young, she's pretty and she can cook. Now you add a man to that, and things is gonna happen. Without even knockin', see what I mean? Why, that Killibrew is an animal. Did I tell you I saw him talkin' to a bear? A bear? Up in Smart Valley, him and the bear sitting on a log, talkin', just like us. I've seen him. I believe that. Did you ever see crazy John Killibrew go fishing? He don't fish with no hook and line like an ordinary man. He reaches down in the water and he catches them with his bare hands No. Yeah. Don't matter what's said about John Killibrew, he's still a lot of man. What a wife you're gonna make for somebody. Who? Anybody! I heard what happened between you and Mr. Batt. Nothing happened there, just gave him a mug of beer. Hmm, yes, I know. Was that wise? I mean, after all, Mr. Batt's a pretty important man in town. I ain't gonna worry about Sam Batt. I ain't got no money. And I am too big for him to whip. ( laughs ) Should we start our lesson? Yeah. How am I doin', anyhow? Oh, you're doin' fine. Hope so. It's been damn near a year. It's been what? ( sighs ) One of the purposes of reading is to acquire vocabulary and lessen the need for profanity. Profanity is merely a stupid person's way of emphasizing a statement, and I think you are past that stage now. I know, Mary. It's just this damn town. ( sighs ) John, you mustn't blame everything on the town. I don't, they blame it on me. Maybe, they got it right. They believed in me, Mary. Followed me here. I grew up in this country with the Indians. I knew like the palm of my hand. I thought I knew exactly where that railroad was gonna come. That was 10 years ago, John. Why can't you forget it? I told you. I can, they can't! Well, that's all your imagination, John. Just like that engine Rafe thinks he saw. He shouldn't be so bitter. ( sighs ) Well... If that's the way I am, then so be it. Well, If you're like that, why don't you leave here. I plan to. Oh? But first, I'm gonna show this town something. What? I don't know. Where would you go? San Francisco. Maybe the Yukon, maybe just sail around the world. I don't know. Would you go alone? I reckon so. I always have. Tonight, you're gonna read Emerson, the essay on self-reliance. Something for a lonely man. It is only as a man puts off from him... from himself all ex... Puts off from himself, all ex... You wanna read first? ( sighs ) All right, I'll read it once, then you do it. It is only as a man puts off from himself all external support and stands alone that I see him to be strong and to prevail. He is weaker by every regroup to his banner. Is not a man better than a town? Read that again. No, you read it now. Please, Mary. Again, slow. It is only as a man puts off from himself all external support and stands alone that I see him to be strong and to prevail. He's weaker by every regroup to his banner. Is not a man better than a town? What are you doing? I've got business. What on earth? You just can't walk-- See you in five days, Mary. John Killibrew! Come beck here and finish your lesson. Do you mind telling me where you're going? Well, I know you've lost your reason but have you lost your voice too? Ain't. "Isn't" if you don't mind. I don't mind. I will have to tell you all about it when I get back, Mary. If I'm here. Oh, you'll be here. Where are you gonna go? John Killibrew, have you gone stark staring mad? I'll tell you about that too, Mary. Well, you needn't bother. And furthermore, you're wrong about the town and they are right about you. You sure about that? Mary, didn't you just read me out of that book that... a man is better than a town? ( horse trotting ) Over a thousand pages and I had to pick that one. ( train whistling ) ( train chugging ) Hiyah! Go home, boy. ( train whistling ) ( brakes screeching ) You crazy or somethin', Killibrew, stopping this train in Indian country? You headed for San Francisco? If you get off the track, I am. Well, you got yourself another piece of baggage. ( train whistling ) MARY: Ta da da dum-- She's burnt it plain and through. Do do do do... Mary, this meat is burnt clean through! Is it now? Ta da da, do do do... MARY: Do do... She didn't even make dessert. Boys, there's something going on around here. Well, I see that you're all enjoying your last supper. I hear you right, Mary? You did, I'm leaving. You're what! Yep. And from now on, you can cook your own meals, wash your dirty dishes and make your own beds. Mary Duren, where are you going with that nighty? To John Killibrew's and I won't be back till I am married. Married? She's sick, Angus. Mary, I am your eldest brother and I'll talk to you now like I was your daddy. You ain't racing over there with no nighty over your arm just to get married. Especially to that crazy John Killibrew. And what does that make me! Oh, go on, tell me. Well, I'll tell you. I admire him, I believe in him and I am gonna marry him. And I am leavin' this house right now. Boys, I don't think, we got much to worry about. Huh? Killibrew has got to ask her first. Well, that pink nighty will sure help make up his mind. Well, let's go and get her. Oh, it ain't gonna make no difference, it ain't gonna help none. What do you mean? Killibrew ain't home. ( laughs ) Well, what if he comes back in the middle of the night? Well, I guess we will have to run shifts and sit out on the front porch and watch. We can do that, can't we? Huh? Yeah. Boys, it ain't so much what's goin' on over there that is worrisome. It's what's gonna happen over here. How's that, Angus? Breakfast. What are we gonna do about breakfast? First time in the city, big boy? Yes, ma'am. Kinda takes you by storm, don't it? Yeah, it does. You interested in a little fun? No, ma'am. I'm looking for the Golden Gate insurance company. Oh, well, I don't know where the insurance company is but I could sure show you the Golden Gate. I am sure you could. Well? No, thanks. What a waste. Yes, sir? My name's Killibrew. I wanna buy a piece of machinery. Machinery? Good heavens, sir. This is an insurance company. Yeah, are you in charge here? Dear me, no. Mr. Hoferkamp is the president, I'm his secretary. Yeah, well, tell him I want to talk to him, will ya. I'm afraid that's impossible. He's tied up now. Well, supposin' you untie him, because I got some business with him. I'll see what I can do. Yeah. ( knocks on door ) All right, man, out with it. Uh, there's a Mr. Killibrew outside, Sir. Killibrew. Never heard of him, what does he want? He wants to buy a machine. Throw him out. I don't think I can, Sir. Well, I can. Would you come in, please? Now then, Mr. Killibrew, what can I do for you? I want to buy a steam engine from you. What would we be doing with a steam engine? I don't know, but you got one. We have? Yep. It's at the bottom of a fishin' hole up at Immigrant Pass. It's a single piston, steel bored battle engine, serial number 1187. Oh, that. Yes, I suppose we do own that now. That's what the folks off the railroad told me. And you want to buy it? If the price is right. Mr. Killibrew, I'm a businessman but not a thief. We've been informed that that engine is absolutely unsalvageable. Not only has it been deemed technically unfeasible, but the Sierra railroad positively refuses to stop a train in that area without an escort of the United States cavalry. Yeah, what's it worth? It costs $10,000 and it's worth nothing. Take a dollar for it? Forgive me for asking, but are you crazy? Well, the opinion is sort of divided on that. Mr. Killibrew... assuming that you're able to recover this steam engine, what would you do with it? I've got plans. I see. Let's say... you perform this miracle. Would you be interested in selling it? Haven't thought about it. Think about it. What would you pay? In good condition, accessible to us, $1,500. How about 3,000? That's quite a sum of money. For a miracle? I like your style, Mr. Killibrew. Give me a dollar. ** I'll gift to you, a paper of pins ** ** If that's the way, my love begins ** ** If you will marry me * ** If you will marry me * ( chuckles ) ( coughing ) ANGUS: Come on, with that water! ANGUS: Hurry! ( everyone coughing ) ( humming ) Good morning, Mary. Pete, go get the rifle. What for? We are three against one, ain't we? That's what I mean, go get it. I worried when your horse came home without ya. I didn't need him where I'd been. Oh? You know, Mary, I must be getting old. I'm plum tuckered out and I only walked 22 miles. That's a good long walk. From where? Railroad tracks up at Immigrant Pass. Oh. I took myself a little trip to the city. Junction City? San Francisco. San Francisco! But what on earth were you-- Now, Mary, why don't you just sit down and I'll tell you all about it. ( banging on the door ) ANGUS: Open up, John Killibrew. What do they want? I think they are after me. For what? Uh, I spent the night here. Oh hey, they know I wasn't here, don't they? I don't know, or care. ( banging on the door ) ANGUS: You open up in there, John Killibrew. Unlock this door now. That ain't necessary, Angus, it's open. We've come to fetch her home where she belongs. Not till I show you somethin'. Sit down. Huh? Sit down. We can stand. Take a look at that. Bill of sale. For a steam engine! I thought you'd be surprised. You bought a steam engine? For a fact. Where is it? Up the line apiece. You mean that water Rafe Runkel's been babbling on about? The same. I went into San Francisco and made a deal with Hoferkamp himself. R.J. Hoferkamp, the headman at the insurance company. That's his signature on that bill of sale which you couldn't read, thanks. Well, then you really own it. That's right. And I'm willing to share it with any man that'll help me. And I want to give you Durens the first chance. If we what? Bring it into town, that's all. That's all? Where is it now? Well, it's up at Immigrant Pass. And what's it doin' there? Why, it's lying at the bottom of the Rock Canyon Pool. ( laughing ) ( laughing ) It's there just like Rafe saw it. All I need is a few men to help me and I can bring her into town. Out of that waterhole? It can be done. And drag it 22 miles back to town? Over them mountains? I admit it ain't gonna be easy but it could be profitable. It's gonna be worth a lot of money. You buy it, John? I got the bill of sale right there. Did it occur to you why you got it for a dollar? They told me. What did they tell you, John? Oh, they were afraid of a little Indian trouble. Yeah, like maybe gettin' tomahawked to death. Let him tell it. Well, you know how them city fellows are. They figure all Indians are just a bunch of screaming savages you can't do business with. Which of course they ain't. Oh no! Not necessarily. You fellows ought to know that. You came here alone, built this town. Yeah, with an axe in one hand and a rifle in the other. Nevertheless, you built it. And what have we got? Look! All I am trying-- Once before, we followed you, Killibrew-- And once was enough. Where you going, John? Well, he's goin' fishin' for a steam engine. What's he gonna use for bait? ( scoffing ) One of these days, he ain't gonna walk away. JOHN: Old man, you loan me three good mules. And I'll bring that engine back here myself. I ain't got but three mules, John. You bet a dollar, you're asking me to bet all I got. Not that I mind. Twenty, thirty years ago, I'd have gone with you. I'll split it right down the line with you. Fifty-fifty Wish I could. You're a man in a town full of women, John. You've nerve enough to come here and gamble on them railroad tracks. They followed you like women. They didn't come out here to start a life out of this country. They come out here to get lucky and rich. You is wrong in your calculations. They take it was you that busted their dreams. Like women, they ain't gonna take the blame. All I got left is them mules. They're gonna carry me to my grave. They're gonna be my pallbearers, John. They're worth every bit of $100. You want 'em, you can have 'em for 50. I ain't got it. Well, I only know one place you can get it. You want to borrow $50? Well now, let's see here. Yeah, Killibrew, Killibrew... Yeah, there it is. Killibrew, you owe exactly $316.82. Including interest, and you are three payments in arrears. And you have the gall to try to borrow 50 more? I need those mules bad, Sam, and I ain't got a nickel. Well, all right. Here's a nickel, Killibrew. You just go buy yourself a beer, and this time, throw it in your own face. ( laughs ) ( laughing ) Tell me, if you was to call a cow out of a thicket, how'd you do it? Moo, moo! Moo! ( laughing ) If you was to call a steam engine out of the water, how'd you do that? Woo, woo! Louder, man. The thing's under the water. I can't hear you. Woo, woo! Toot! ( laughs ) ( laughing ) Look at him? John! My brothers are right, you are crazy. ( panting ) Whiskey. ( clears throat ) Leave the bottle. Ah, charge it. Anything you say, John. Ah. ( humming ) Mighty fine supper we had tonight, Mary. Wasn't it a good supper, Pete? Best eaten since you took over mom, Mary. You hear? You hear? You heard about Killibrew? He's down at the saloon drinking it up just like they're gonna quit making it. Killibrew cutting up some, is he? My, my. Oh, he's had a bad day. First old man Wolenski turns him down, then Mules. Then he got the guts to go to Sam Batt for $50. I never seen a grown man go downhill so fast. Standing there at the bar since sundown just swilling it back. PETER: Oh... Amazing he's still standing. Just barely I'd say. There now, Mary. You see for yourself. And lucky for you, you've seen it in time. The town nut to the town drunk. ( laughs ) Why don't you just shut up? What did I say that ain't a fact? You never tell a woman a fact, Eben. May be I better talk to her. You sit down. It ain't easy for a woman to get over something like this. Now, she'll go inside and have herself a little cry. As women will do, and by tomorrow morning, she'll be her old self, again. Why is she going to town? She's going shopping. At night? Oh, let her walk it off, boy. She's just trying to get John Killibrew out of her system. Is... Only as a man... Cuts off from himself... All ex... Is only as a man puts off from himself all ex... Ex..." MARY: External. External. Go on, read it. But you still haven't read it to me. Remember? External support. And stands alone... That I see him to be strong and to prevail. He is weaker by every... Recruit. Recruit. To his banner. Is not... a man... better... than a town. Come on. ( spitting ) Now, you let this happen just 'cause there's some mules? No. No, it wasn't just the mules. It was everything. Everybody in town thinks I'm crazy, I can put up with that. But, when you said I was crazy. Well, I... I thought you believed in me, Mary. Oh, John. You wanted those mules? They're hanging at the clothesline. Mary, how'd you get 'em? I bought 'em. Fifty dollars? Um-hmm. Where'd you get the money? My dowry. Mary, I'll get that steam engine. I'll show this town. I'll take those mules, and I'll go, tonight. And, you'll take me. Mary, that ain't no place for a woman. Anywhere her man is, that's a woman's place. Ain't that pretty? Are we bringing the steam engine back this way? No, no, I'm afraid it's a little narrow. We'd probably have to take it over that mountain. Whoop, ho-ho! Ho-ho. Come on, Mary. There she is. Where? Right down there. Are you sure it's down there, John? Well, sure, I'm sure. Who could've moved it? That's what I'm wondering, too. John? Yeah? You know I wouldn't be here if I didn't have a lot of faith in you. Yeah, I know that, Mary. Yeah? Well, I just don't believe it. What? Well, I just don't believe you can drag a steam engine out of that pool. Well, I don't either. The way I figured, if you can't drag a steam engine out of the pool you just move the pool away from the steam engine. You just move the pool? Sure. Mary, you know what they used to call me when I lived with the Indians? Big Beaver. All right, big Beaver. How do you move a pool? You drain it. Just step back, Mary. You step back. Hey, Mary. You all right? Can't you make these rocks any smaller? Hey, honey, I don't make 'em, I just dig 'em. Leave the more big ones for me. Can we do it, John? Can we really do it? Of course, we can do it. Just the two of us. You and me together. You and I. That's right. You and me. Ah! Ah! Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you. Well, I'm not sorry. Ugh, and I'm not for sure I'm altogether awake yet either. Well, John Killibrew, you've really done it. Yep. Today, we drain the pool. I don't mean the pool. Then, what? That you've been sleeping with me these past few nights. Mary, I didn't lay a hand on you. You know that. How would I know? I'm so tired everyday. I sleep like a log. Well, you can take my word for it. Well, I do, John. Will the rest of the town? I better fix our breakfast, John. Mary, listen to me. Hmm. I-I give you my solemn word. What? Isn't your word that matters anymore. Oh, I see. It's them three loudmouth brothers of yours, huh? Out of my hands. Well, it's in mine, and I can whup all three of them. They know that, John. They'll have guns. Mary. I don't need no gun to make me marry you. ( coughs ) Help! A little water. All right, boys. Let's go get her. Hey, Mary! Mary! Hey, Mary! Mary! Mary! Hey, Mary! JOHN: Mary! I'm taking a bath. Mary! Hey, Mary! Hey, Mary! She's coming up high and dry. What is? The steam engine. It's coming up out of the water. Oh, John. That's wonderful. Yeah. Well, come on, get out. I want you to see. Well, I don't want you to. Huh? Turn around, please. Well, come on, Mary. Hurry up, we got to get going. MARY'S BROTHER: You ain't going anywhere, Killibrew. Except the church. And not 'cause it's Sunday either. And you're going too, Mary. Not without John, I'm not. Oh, he's going. One way or the other. I told ya. Do you, Mary, take John to be your lawful wedded husband? I most certainly do. And do you, John, take Mary to be your lawful wedded wife? Since he's going to be one in the family, I'm going to speak for him. He do. A man maybe gets married one time in his life. When he takes that vow, he don't want no gun in his back. Now, speak that question again. Do you, John, take Mary to be your lawful wedded wife? I do. I now pronounce you Man and Wife. Is that it? I'm through. I'm not. Mr. and Mrs. John Killibrew. ( congratulating ) Choo-choo. ALL: Choo-choo. I didn't hear anything? Did you? Not a thing. Hyah! Hyah! Yes, sir. You know, old Killibrewy ain't such a bad fellow for a brother-in-law. I think that ma would smile on them, right now. I think that one of these days, he's gonna settle... Settle down in the mountains or something. You know, what they say? What they all say? What's that, Eben? A wedlock's a padlock. ( laughs ) Eben? ( continues ) Eben? He's one of us now. That's right. And he might even share our chores with us. Yep. Yep. He might even share our meals with us. Yep. And, by the devil's forked tail, I think that he ought to be over here sharing our whiskey with us right now. That's a good idea. Pete, you go over there and see if that light is still burning. Still burning. Good. Then, we're gonna go over and show some brotherhood, and invite them over. Maybe Mary can fix us a little snack. Maybe we ought to let them know we're coming. I could throw a rock at the door. That's a good idea, Eben. That's a good idea. That ain't the door. I think that they heard that. I'll knock. Nobody's home. That ain't all. Their horse is gone. ( clears throat ) We have gone on our honeymoon. See you soon with a surprise. Surprise? Do you think, maybe? No, couldn't be that. I know what it is. What is it, Angus? It's that dang steam engine. Whoa. Come on, Mary. Let's go. It's gone! Confound it, I should never have left it in the first place. I never should've gone back to town. You mean, to get married? Oh, Mary. A man can get married any day. But how any times in his life does he get a chance to find a steam engine? John Killibrew, are you sure? Are you really sure it was ever there? You were there when I drained that pool. No, I wasn't! I was at the camp, taking a bath! Oh, I see. It never was here in the first place, right? I'm just seeing things. Is that it? I'll tell you what, you get on that horse and I'll show you where that steam engine went. You mean to tell me we're following the trail of a steam engine? Nope. I'm following our mules. ( indistinct chatter ) How'd you know? Well, there's been one of them fellers spying on us every day. I'll go talk to them. You can't. Sure, I can. ( indistinct chatter ) ( continues ) ( continues ) ( whistle blows ) ( speaking Iroquoian ) ( continues ) ( laughs ) ( continues ) John, John, there's something I don't understand. What's that? How are we gonna get this steam engine back to town? Back to town? We'll wheel it. But where are you gonna get the wheels? I'm a black smith. ( laughter ) Hyah. What do you think of these two little dandies for supper? ( laughs ) You mean you caught 'em without a fishing line? Why, sure. Just reached in there and got 'em while they was asleep. Oh, they're beautiful. You mean, they were sleeping together? Yep, just like husband and wife. Just like us, Mary. Not quite like us. ( mumbling ) "Is not a man better than a town." You bet you he is. John? John? Ow. Mary. What in heaven's name-- Yes, John? What's that you've got on anyhow? My pink nightgown. Well, I can see that. But, you can't wear a pretty little thing like that out here. You'll catch you're death. Well, I wasn't planning to-- Mary, if you got sick out here, I wouldn't get you back. Now, I'm gonna get you an extra blanket. But I don't want another blanket. I'll get it, no problem. But Mrs. John Killibrew shouldn't need-- Like I said, no problem, Mary. No problem. John? John! Hmmm. ( train whistle blows softly ) You-- ( thunder crashes ) MARY: James! James! Whoa! Hiyah! Hiyah! ( John panting ) Not many people carrying their own stoves with them, now are there, Mary? Reckon we are sort of lucky to find all this dry kindling, huh? It just ain't right to make a beast of burden out of anything so lovely. Are you talking about me or the steam engine? Oh, Mary, I... ( throaty roar ) ( gasps ) He'll kill us. It ain't a he, and I think I know her. Now, you get around behind the steam engine. Don't get scared and make any foolish moves. Just stay right there. Howdy, ma'am? Nice to see you again. Hey, that's a mighty cute little cub you got there. Yes, sir, he-- he's a dandy! ( bear growling ) It's a steam engine, ma'am. I wouldn't touch it, it might be a little bit hot. ( engine whistles ) Phew. If I shot her five times, she would still kill both of us. You know, I thought I knowed her But I reckon I didn't. I'll say, you didn't. Yeah. Dang, if they don't all look just alike. JOHN: Hiyah! Hiyah! ( whimpers in pain ) I know just the thing for that. Come on. Bear grease. It ain't too pretty. But it sure is soothin'. Here! How's that? Better? You know, Mary! We're sure gonna have a story to tell our children, aren't we? I'm glad to know we're gonna have children. Sure we gonna have children. Lots of 'em. Mary, you know what that steam engine means? It means our kids ain't gonna grow up in a... a little ignorant mountain town. Means they can have an education like you and see the big cities of the world. Grow up to be something better than me. You know what I mean? No. You don't? I mean, I can't imagine anybody being better than you. JOHN: Whoa, ho-ho! We could keep going, we could make five miles today. Don't you ever get tired? I am tired. ( John gasps ) ( John breaths heavily ) You know, Mary? This trip learnt me something I always wondered about. Taught! Taught. What? It taught me why a man would wanna go over the mountains. Push up the sea, and go over Niagara Falls in a barrel. Know what I mean? Yep. You do? ( rumbling ) The mules! Ha! Hiyah, hiyah. ( rumbling ) It's gone! The Lord just didn't want me to have that engine. Oh, John! He just wouldn't let me have it. I'll get the mules. Why? Why? MARY: John, John! come here quick! John! John, quick! The Lord sure does move in mysterious ways. ( John gasping ) ( laughing ) JOHN: Hiyah! Hiyah! JOHN: Hiyah! Hiyah! Get up here, get up. He's bringing it in. He's bringing it in. JOHN: Hiyah! Hiyah! JOHN: Whoa! Whoa! Mary? Mary. Look familiar? Mary, we're pretty near there. We're pretty near home. We've done it? ( Mary gasps ) We've really done it? Well, not quite. We still gotta cross Meta Creek. After all this rain, the ground's gonna be a little soft. Hyah! Hyah! He's bringing it in here! He's bringing it in here! He's bringing it in here, everybody! Hey! He's bringing it here! He's bringing like he said, he would. Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Who's bringing what in? Big John! He's bringing in the steam engine. What? Yeah, come on. Come on. Hey, hey, everybody! He's bringing it in here. He's bringing it in here. He's bringing... You believe that? It's ridiculous! That's impossible. Is it? Saddle me up. ( all shouting ) Shovel. Can't we use the mules? Nope, if we get this thing straightened up, they're liable to tip it over, then we would really be stuck. Couldn't we go to the town for help? We could, but we ain't. What is it? No. John! It looks like the town is coming out here. MAN: Woo-hoo! Hey, everybody! Hey! Hey! ( man laughing ) ( crowd jeering ) MAN: Bring him in. Oh, what do you know? ( crowing jeering ) ( all laughing ) Need some help, John? I don't need no help from none of you. Well, let's see you lift it then, Killibrew. - ( all laugh ) - MAN: Yeah. Don't be a bore, John. Let us give you a hand. Sure, John. We can get that engine out of there in no time. None of you. Not a one of you offered to help when I asked. Now I don't want it, so just go on home, all of ya. You better get yourself a row boat, Killibrew. You're gonna need it. ( crowd jeering ) ( sneezes ) You want us to hitch on and haul you out? There ain't nobody haulin', Angus! Nobody, but me. But they are only trying to help, John. We don't need any. I don't understand you, John Killibrew. People offered to help and you stand there on a mountain of foolish pride and refuse. What's the matter with you? I don't need no help, I don't need nobody! Then you don't need me either. And when you try it again, hitch yourself to the mules. You're just as stubborn and just as dumb. ( thunder ) I tell you one thing, gentlemen. That steam engine isn't so funny as this town thinks, neither is John Killibrew. Everybody was laughing pretty hard, Sam. Bleeck, laughing at some poor boob is one thing, but when you keep on laughing, you are a boob yourself. Go on about that steam engine, Sam. Yeah, well... To Killibrew, that engine is worth whatever he can sell it for. Maybe much as $2,000 to $3,000. But to me, the town, that is, that engine could mean a fortune. That could bring prosperity by turning the wheels of industry. What industry? I'll tell you. All of you men have stands of timber around here. Well, what has it been used for? I'll tell you. To hunt rabbits in, to get firewood, and once a year cut down a Christmas tree. But those aren't just trees on that land, gentlemen. What are they, Sam? Well, I'll tell you. They are... bridges, furniture, houses, ships. And you know what turns them into that? The saw mill. And do you know what operates the saw mill? A steam engine. I ask you gentlemen to imagine that this town that missed being a railroad setter now rise into a lumber metropolis in the wilderness. Industry, growth, riches... That should be its destiny and our fortune. And do you know where our fortune lies? It's stuck in the mud. Out there, two miles from here. So, I say, instead of laughing at Killibrew, we should have pitched in to help him. Some of the people offered to, Sam. Sure, ask Jones, We tried. And what did he say? Same thing. He said, he don't need nobody, he's going to do all hisself. Who could rightly blame him? We did him an injustice, all of us. We had a great man in our midst and we didn't realize it. Uh! It's a matter of history. The injustice of mankind. Therefore I say to make amends. We show him exactly the kind of men that we really are and how we really feel. How do we feel, Sam? He wants to sell that engine, well... we buy it from him. We will meet his price, we'll go out there first thing in the morning and we will put it to him fair and square. What if he ain't willing to sell, Sam? I nee-- We need that engine, Angus. He'll sell. One way or the other. You got the other way, Sam? Right her, Angus. John Killibrew! $316.82. Three payments in arrears. A little toast, gentlemen. To the brawn on John Killibrew and the brains of Sam Batt. Yeah, I'll drink to that. ANGUS: Are you having trouble, John? We come to help. Now we have been sitting up for whole night and thinking and we figured, we owe you an apology. So that's why we came out here. Early like this. To apologize. And we ought to have been helping you out with that engine from the beginning. So you may as well accept our offer, John, 'cause it's all in the family now. Let me set you boys straight. First of all, that engine ain't in the family, it's in the mud, and it's mine. And I will get it out of here by myself. RAFE: Buddy! Hey, Big John! They are coming after it, Big John. They are going to take it away from you. They are going to get it from you, Big John. I hear him, Rafe. Can I help you, Big John? No, no. You just stay out of the way. MAN: Yo hoo-hoo! Hey! Hey, come back. ( overlapping chatter ) Killibrew, I think I owe you an apology and I think I speak for every man in this town. I don't see any. I know how you must feel, I can't say I blame you. But I also realized that words have little meaning. So I didn't bring just conversation here. I brought along something that you would understand. Money! Killibrew, I will buy that engine for any price you name, right here, right now. You just name it. Sam, if I could trade you a dead horse for the Union Pacific Railroad, I'd rather walk to St. Louis on my bare feet. I don't think you heard rightly. This is United States currency I'm holding here. You just give the word and I'll start peeling. Put your money in your pocket, Sam. I ain't selling that engine to you or nobody else, and I never had any intention to. All right, I tried to be fair. Go ahead, Sheriff. John, I gotta serve you with this here paper. It's the law. Now, take it. Go ahead, John. Please now, John, it's the law. Now this ain't my doing, but the law's the law and I got the badge. You owe him money. Legally, He can take that engine. Let him try. Killibrew, I made you a fair and square offer, and these good people here heard me. So if you don't wanna do business with me, you've gotta do business with the sheriff. It's the law, John. MARY: Is it? Is that the law, Sheriff? When a man refuses to sell something that is really his, you can--you can bring out a piece of paper and take it away from him? But John owes him money, Mary. An honest debt which he'll pay, and you know it. Anyway, Sam Batt doesn't care about the money he's owed, he just wants that machine. And all you're doing is help him steal it by telling everybody, "It's the law." Well, you heard her, Sheriff. It's gonna take more than a little piece of paper to take that engine. Or me. All right, men, take it. I wouldn't do that if I were you. Well, you ain't me. That's what I am here for. Aren't you gonna do somethin', Sheriff? Not until they finish, I ain't. John! Think we should help him. He said he wanted to do it hisself. Oh, Angus, come on, it's four against one. That ought to be about even. Of course, we could help him a little. I gotta take you in, Killibrew. It's the law. You tore a legal paper, caused a public riot with assault and some battery. It's against the law to beat up a man, let alone four. What about five? The same thing, John. Good. You ready, John? I am now. MARY: Don't you dare leave, any of ya. Now you listen to me. You too, Mr. Batt. For 10 years, you've been humiliating that man. You've mocked him and cursed him behind his back, you are afraid to say it to his face. And now, gutless as always, you let the sheriff take him off to jail. You want us to interfere with the law? No. I want you to understand what is really happening here. This machine that none of you cared about or even wanted, this steam engine is John Killibrew's payment for that mistake he made 10 years ago. You see... he knew that... that this steam engine could be the beginning of this town. A future for all of us. So, now you have a choice. You can let Sam Batt keep the engine and go on running you and this town, or you can follow John Killibrew like you did once before. Now, which is it? SHERIFF: You got so many charges against you, John, I'm gonna have to write 'em down. Tearing up a legal paper, causing a public disturbance, four men flattened... How much was that debt of yours, John? ( sighs ) $316.82. RAFE: Sheriff! Sheriff! Sheriff! Hey, Sheriff! What is it, Rafe? They're coming, Sheriff. They're coming. Who's coming? The women. The women! Yeah, they're all coming. And one of them is carrying a rope. My goodness, they're coming for you, John. They're coming for me? The women, they're comin' to get you, man. But don't you worry. I've never lost a prisoner yet. We'll sneak out the back way, and ride to the city! Rafe, you take them horses around the back. They'll never lynch John Killibrew as long as I am sheriff. But, Sheriff, the women don't want to lynch John. What? They want to lynch you. Me? My goodness. John, you gotta get out of there. They aren't coming for you, they are coming for me. What are you letting me out for? For protection! Get out there now! Here they come! Hold it, ladies. We're coming out. We are not! ( banging door ) John! John! I sold the steam engine. You sold it? Yes, to the citizens of Arkana. A share a piece, except for me, I bought 50. 50? Yeah, I sold the mules back to Mr. Wolenski. What about Sam Batt? Oh, not a share to him or his friends. Here you are, Sheriff. $316.82. WOMEN: Hurray! You are paid up, Killibrew but I still have got to hold you for causing a public commotion. That's the law. ( shouting ) It's the law! It's the law! But, I 'm--I'm gonna drop them charges, and call it self-defense. Mary, I am puzzled about something. You are, John? Yeah, can I buy a share? Of course not, you own it. I do? Most of it. Capitalized at $3,000, at a dollar a share, you're now holding 2,684 shares. Really? Of course you are. When we finish your reading, we'll tackle arithmetic and I'll prove it to you. ( cheering and laughing ) Mary, suppose you tell me what took place out there after I left. Oh, I guess the good people of Arkana just had a large dose of plain truth. Say cheers to my brother-in-law, he's rich. Hey, everybody, grab your partner. Swing! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! I think we oughta have a drink to the bride and the groom. Where did they go? WOMAN: Where do you think, sonny! They went on their honeymoon. Well, here's to their honeymoon. ( music playing ) Doggone, what a day, huh? Everybody in town invested in my steam engine. What a day for our kin! And all because of you, Mary Duren. What did you say? I said all because of you-- My name is Mary Killibrew. That's the way it's gonna be around here. Mary Killibrew, wow. Now, I don't think I'll have a lot of trouble remembering that. Swing! ( engine whistles ) ( engine whistles )
