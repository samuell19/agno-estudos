Chibi, what are you doing? Come on, the show is about to start. Let's go. Had enough? Could you please stop bothering me? I don't even know you, and you're really annoying like this. Yongki, we've been together since we were kids. So, goodbye. It's getting exciting now, a ball is about to fly! Yongki! Yongki, are you okay? Sun Hee. It's you, right? I've been waiting for you. Have you finally regained your memory? Yongki "What are you talking about? I've always been by your side." There's something I must tell you. "I only have you in my heart" I always thought it was just my one-sided love. It was me who had one-sided feelings, wasn't it? Yeah, you two were in love with each other. Then, what about the things you said to me? - Sun hee. - Yongki. But the person who will marry Yongki in the end is Miying, whom he fell in love with when he lost his memory. It was Sun Hee who was always there by his side. What's wrong? Are you angry? Alright, I understand. Great, time to go shopping. I wonder what the my husband wants to eat. Good afternoon. Hello, would you like to buy some fresh sashimi? We have some delicious fatty tuna belly prepared. But my husband has been finding even fish oil greasy lately. Then, how about trying the sawara fish? It's delicious when grilled with salt Maybe next time. Thanks. I see. Please come again. I see, welcome next time Welcome. These oranges are delicious today. Would you like to try one? Thank you. How is it? Very sweet. (Igo Dojo) I'm back. [Only The Cat Knows] You're back. Good boy. What's wrong? How was your day? Did anything good happen? He's back. You're back. Where's the bathwater? It's already heated. Hey! Coming, what's up? And Ms. Ono this time... Seems to be going to Tateshina Highland for a vacation, and there's a hot spring too. Soaking in a hot spring on a highland sounds great, right? By the way, what's it called there? The place where you can bathe with monkeys. Let me think... You won't go to the hot springs with the monkeys, will you? Of course not. Who would soak with monkeys? That's right, Chibi. Where was I? Anyway, Mrs. Ono also wants to go there. She asked if I'm interested. it will be the two of us and the Ono couple. Last time, when she invited us to Kamakura, We didn't go either. "The recent rain will intensify the autumn feeling." "Next, let's take a look at tomorrow's weather forecast" How's the weather today? Just like usual. I see. Tea? "In the morning, western Japan will briefly clear up, but it will gradually turn cloudy afterward." "In the evening, rain is expected to fall in various regions." "Audiences returning home late should carry umbrellas." "Tomorrow, the maximum temperature in most areas will be higher than today." "Tokyo, 17 degrees; western Japan might exceed 20 degrees." "Now let's have a look at the week's weather forecast." "In eastern and northern Japan by Friday, rain clouds will gradually spread, and in places without the rain symbol, there may be brief showers." "After the showers end..." I'm full. "On Saturday morning, the minimum temperature will drop below 10 degrees in various regions, and some areas will experience the coldest weather of this autumn." That's right. Don't you want to see the monkeys too? Monkeys that bathe in hot springs. right? The kid's father. The bed is ready. What's wrong, little one? disturb me like this. Geez! Hello. Wait a minute, really. Husband! Today, there's delicious flounder. It's a big piece. Can we get it sliced? Of course. Look. Two slices, please? - That's fine. - Thank you. Dinner's ready. Here it is. This is the Takei family. What's wrong? Oh, I see. I understand. Dad said he'd come home late. Do you want to eat? Just kidding Let's cook some tofu. I'm full. When eating alone, you finish so quickly. I feel like I'm always relying on Chibi. Don't you think so? Mom, I bought chestnuts. This time, they seem smaller. They were cheaper. Where's dad? He's playing shogi. Then we have to save some for him. He loves chestnuts. Be careful; it's hot. How old is Chibi? 11: 13 or 14, not yet 15. Chibi is already an old lady. How old are you then? Don't ask me that. 37. 2: Oh, come on. You're almost 40. No, I just said 37. Right, Chibi? Busy at work? Yeah, being in management is demanding. Girls don't need to climb that high in their careers. As for me... Enough, don't repeat the same thing every time. I won't get married just for the sake of it. Is that so? Well, it's also an option. - Does Dad still go to the company? - Yes. Every day? Not every day. When you're a consultant, you must have a lot of free time. He could just hide away and enjoy a life of ease. Mom wanted to go on a trip, right? I'm considering whether to get a divorce. Divorce with whom? With your dad. Original milk. - Thank you for Visiting. - Thank you for Visiting. Coffee milk and red bean bread. I'll have a fruit milk. Thank you for your hospitality. Hello, I'd like an original milk and a cream bread. Sure. - Sorry. - It's okay. I'm really sorry. Sorry, thank you for visiting. - Sorry. - take care on your way. I'm sorry. Don't treat everyone as guests. Just imagine they are eggplants or pumpkins, Shizuko… Keep up the good work. - Original milk and jam bread. - Thank you for Visiting. You move so deftly, and your smile is so lovely. Thank you for the compliment, take care on your way. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Are you as punctual today as always? - Yes. Thank you for Visiting. Take care on your way. I'd like a cream bread and coffee milk. -Thank you visiting. - How much is it? That will be 70 yen. Are you getting used to it? Not at all. Have a seat. Here. Thank you. The guy just now was handsome. Who are you talking about? The one at 7:25. Yes Is he a regular customer? yes he always comes to buy from me. Chibi? I forgot to close the window. Chibi, it's time to sleep. Do you live nearby? Yes, I just moved here recently. Do you play shogi (Japanese chess)? No, I've never played before, What? You've never played at all? except when I was little at my grandfather's place. Actually, I don't even remember if I played or not. Why did you come here then? Because you invited me in just now. Oh, I see. You're quite interesting. Really? Are you not working today? I quit my job to focus on writing novels. So, you're a writer. But once I have time, I don't know what to write. Your turn. Don't make that move! What? sorry. The 'Silver' cannot move sideways or backward. I understand. The 'Gold' cannot move like that either. Not this way. And the 'Silver'... The 'Silver' can't move here or here. The 'Gold' can't move like that. - Do you understand?" - Yes. Chibi! Chibi! You haven't come back yet? Where did you run off to? Chief, I'm sorry. We couldn't finalize the packaging, so we made all the trial products. There are so many variations. Not bad. Also, I came up with several product names myself. Young people are really hardworking. But if you propose this, the meeting will probably never end. - Okay, let's discuss it next time. You can sit down. The names have already been decided beforehand. Hey, Mom. It's alright. What's up? What? Haven't seen Chibi in a while? Chibi. Has Chibi ever been gone for so long? That's it I'm going to check with the shelter. I don't think he'll be caught, but it's best to ask. Calm down, it's just the wind. But… Naoko said if she's caught, She might be put down. What should I do then? What's the situation? Really? That's great. I thought so too. Naoko, are you coming back today?" I see. Oh, but that's fine too. but that's not bad Alright, I'll leave it to you. Thank you. There doesn't seem to be any cat like Chibi at the shelter. She might come back on her own. I wonder what happened to her. Maybe that's why she can't come back. By the way, I'll go to the park and have a look. Chibi. Come back soon, it's me. Chibi. I used to find her here. Chibi, Have you come back here? Chibi, Honey, can you make it in time? I know. Your hat, scarf, and coat. your purse and lunchbox. Oh, and tissues and handkerchief. Be careful on the way. I forgot to take something. Forgot what? That... what is that? my pen, I left it on the second-floor table. I'll go get it. Morning, I'm Sasahara from Pet Research. Research? - Yes, - what's that? We received a request from your home. Our home didn't request that. I asked him to help find Chibi. I asked him to help find Chibi. Don't just bring in any strange person. What if he's a thief? Don't say that. Naoko already checked him out. He's just looking for cats, calling it "Research" in English. I understand. Rush, or you'll be late for work. Here, take your pen. Everything will be fine when you return. Be careful not to be late. Take care on the way. My husband was so rude. I'm sorry. My last name is Takei. My last name is Sasahara. My last name is Takei. (Consignment letter) - Let me confirm. - Yes. The name is "Chibi," a 13-year-old female cat. She's black with a slightly longer tail and no collar. Wouldn't it have been better to put a collar on her from the beginning? yes. If you had left contact information on the collar, the person who found her would probably have contacted you. I was afraid Chibi wouldn't like the collar. In the past, she never wandered far from the neighborhood. I never thought she would go to other places. I see. Can I go around the neighborhood to search for her? Sure. Why did she run away? Well, one possibility is that she lost a fight with another cat and was driven out of her territory. Maybe she got scared and couldn't come back Could someone else have taken her and given her a new home? The worst possibility is that she had an accident. Of course, it's not certain. Do you have any idea where she might have gone? let me see - Let's go take a look. - Let's go. It seems there are no traces of the cat. I found her right here. She was so tiny back then. Does Chibi come here occasionally? I'm not sure. I have no idea what Chibi does outside. They say that spayed female cats usually have their territory within a radius of 150 meters from their homes, but this place seems a bit far for that. But maybe she was born here and might want to come back and visit. I'm not sure; it depends on whether she remembers when she was little. You have a point. If she was raised here from a young age, she probably considers you her mom. Chibi, come back quickly. Chibi! - Chibi? - Chibi? Where does Chibi usually pass by? She usually follows along the back fence and then drinks water here. Although we also put water at home for her. Cats often behave like that. Then I'll put the cage in that corner. Once the cat goes inside, the door will close automatically. Please put some strongly scented food inside, like fried chicken or something. Can I put stewed fish instead? Stewed fish? She loves it; she always follows me when I'm cooking it. If I give her a little, she eats it contentedly. Since it's something she loves, it's worth a try. Then I'll give it a shot. welcome. Have you been waiting long? No, you are as punctual as always. I'm sorry. Chibi! What should we do? Whose cat are you? Come over here. Come here. Are you angry? I'm trying to take you home. What's going on? what are you doing? Another cat got into the cage, and I tried to rescue it, but I got scratched. Let me help you up. It hurts, it hurts so much. I think my bone might be broken. How is that possible? Call an ambulance. No need to be so dramatic; call a taxi. Thank you for your help. what did the doctor say? The X-ray showed no broken bones, so I should be fine. The doctor said it's just a minor injury from the scratch, but it might get swollen or cause a fever later. I should keep an eye on it. How much did you spend? I haven't gone to the counter yet, so I'm not sure. I mean, the place you called, "Research." ¥100,000. ¥100,000? Are you sure you're not being scammed? I paid with my own money. But that was my money in the first place. Chibi is getting old. She's probably gone to find her final resting place. You don't need to worry about her anymore. I'm really sorry for getting you injured. It's alright, it's my own fault. If we catch another cat, it will be troublesome as well. Now that I think about it, if Little Dot really comes back, we won't need the cage, Right? You have a point. So, what's next for today? Place these in a conspicuous location. You've got them mixed up. (Missing Cat Notice - Chibi) Will this really help us find Chibi. My husband said Chibi is old it's just looking for its final resting place. He told me to stop searching. I see. But I heard that cats don't predict their own death. When wild animals are weak or injured they hide in safe places until they recover. Some cats become weaker and die, leading to misunderstandings. Reality isn't as romantic as humans imagine. I'm not sure now... Are you alright? Though I can't guarantee we'll find it for sure, I'll do my best. Let's keep trying. Thank you. I appreciate your help. She's my daughter, Naoko. Hello, my last name is Yamazaki. Aren't you supposed to be at work today? I heard that mom was injured, so I took time off to visit. It's just a minor injury. That seems to be the case. Hey, it's your turn. Sorry. I feel so embarrassed. I feel like a general. You're going to get eaten. Why? I'm back. Elder sister? You're here so early. Come, this is dad's favorite. No way, it's chestnuts. - We already have some at home. - I don't know. Big brother also bought some. Welcome back. Annoying, don't scare me. Where's mom? She went shopping. I just missed her on the way. She probably went to the department store. She always prepares something when big brother comes back. Where's dad? He went downstairs. - Downstairs? To where?" - To the storage room. Don't cook everything at once. Come and sit here. Freeze some of it after cooking it first. I see, that's how it's done. Big brother probably doesn't understand. It's because you never do any household chores. When men are away on business alone, they must smell bad. So, what's the matter? You specially chose to meet me when big brother is back. It's not easy for a housewife to leave her home. Are you saying you've broken off the engagement again? Please, don't go looking for another runaway groom. Please, stop bringing that up. Why didn't it work out last time? Did you cheat? I told you it was because Naoko got promoted, right? The other party couldn't handle her earning more than him. Big brother should know men are concerned about their pride. It should have been the other party who was responsible for canceling the wedding, Father stepped forward to take care of it... Enough from both of you. This time, it's not about me, right? Isn't it about dad having cancer? Mom said she wants a divorce with dad. What do you mean? Is she talking about separation? I think she really wants a divorce. Why? I don't know. But she was very clear when she spoke to me. How could that be? How old does she think she is? What reason does she have to want a divorce? Whatever. A while ago... I saw mom hugging another man. What? How could mom do something like that? Are you saying she's having an affair? Who is the person? Do you know him? I don't know. He looks to be under 30 years old. Is this for real? Where did she meet such a young man? Is he trying to scam her for marriage? Don't spread rumors. Moreover, that person looks a lot like him. like who? The male lead in the Korean drama mom loves. I'm back. You're back. You're back. What's going on? We brought these for you. Does anyone know where my pillow went? This one is for big brother to use. You can use the pillowcase yourself. - Is this enough? - Mom. We suddenly came back, and there wasn't enough time to air the quilt. If you feel cold, add a blanket. Mom, I'm asking you. You and dad fell in love and got married, right? Who knows? Your dad doesn't seem to think so. What do you mean? You can ask your dad yourself. I think it's okay to get a divorce. Starting anew with a younger man and enjoying the rest of life isn't a bad idea. What are you two talking about? You mentioned last time that you wanted a divorce, right? I heard that you were hugging a young man in the park. The park? I was actually handing out flyers with the pet detective... Ugh, you guys came back because of that? And that person was introduced by Naoko. Is that so? That person? Dad's back. - What are you doing? - Naoko, what's going on? But I saw it myself, hugging like this... Enough, it feels so uncomfortable. But Mom did mention she wants a divorce. Then just ask Dad directly. Find out if something happened between them. It sounds like it's none of your business, why don't you ask? - Me? Ask? - Yes, that's what I'm saying. Alright, let's eat. Thanks. Let's dig in. Big brother, let me pour for you. Dad, is there something wrong? I don't know where Chibi ran off to. I heard you hired a pet detective. How did it go? He's a nice guy, but it seems like Dad doesn't like him. dad, did you and Mom... have a love marriage? What? I mean, did you and Mom fall in love and then get married? We had an arranged marriage. Oh, I see. It was an arranged marriage. Pass me the beer. This is delicious. Did you forget something? No, I didn't forget. Wait for me a moment. Though I'm not sure, they'll probably sort it out as a couple. Even if they are a couple, there are things that can't be easily sorted out. Let's keep in touch if anything comes up. Thank you for your help. You two are really indifferent to others' affairs. What can we do? You live closest. Wait, take these chestnuts back with you. - We can't finish so many. - Thanks. Thank you. Goodbye. Take care. Goodbye. I wonder when we'll have sukiyaki again. Probably not until the New Year. Mom, do you remember what you told me last time? What will you do? Do you really want a divorce? You can't live alone, can you, Mom? Take some time to think it over calmly. I'm going back. Chibi. Um... hello. We've met before. Hello. Are you going to play chess now? Yes, I was just about to. Has there been any progress now? No, not much progress yet. Are you still getting a handicap with the flying chariot and angle mover? And the keima and "sojusha"... "Do you mean 'shusha'?" - Yes, exactly, 'shusha'. The silver general also gets a handicap. what are you doing now? My mom's cat is missing, and I'm looking for it. What does the cat look like? It's a black cat. This is the one. Can I take one away? Can I take one of these to put up at the shogi dojo? Can you help me with that? I'll put it up properly. I'm really sorry sorry to bother you Mr. Takei. look I wanted to ask, who makes your bento (lunchbox)? It's my wife. I see. Because the dishes are always the same, I thought you made them yourself. Isn't it boring to eat the same dishes every day? Not at all! It's better if it's the same. I see. That's how it is. (Cafe Fresco) Coffee milk and cream bread. Here's the coffee milk and cream bread. - Let me see. - Have you decided what to order? - have you decided? -let me see Then, cream bread and plain milk. That will be 60 yen. Red bean bread and milk. Alright. - Good morning. The weather is nice today, isn't it? - Yes. - Did you get a haircut? - Yes. Here, be careful on your way. Are you getting used to the job? I'm not sure if I can say I'm used to it. Is it tough? I'm thinking of quitting. It's just a waste of Auntie's effort to set me up. In that case, how about this? Another arranged meeting? I don't want that. I want a love marriage. Love marriage? Do you have someone in mind? You're still single, right? Consider it as practice. Just meet once and see. But when I reject him later, Auntie can't complain, alright? Speaking of arranged meetings, Guys always seem so uncomfortable. Always pretending to be serious or smiling strangely. I hope I won't be shocked or anything. I'm Takei Masaru. And this is Yukiko Ueno. I'm sorry, I probably can't match up to you. That's not true. Um... I've made up my mind. I want to marry the first arranged meeting partner. You mean... it's me? Yes! We're going to have a wedding! Your child is adorable. I never expected my husband's team compete against Mr. Takae company. That's right. After you resigned, I got married immediately too. My partner is a regular customer here. Really? What kind of person is he? The one over there with glasses. I already knew you married Mr. Takei. After he stopped coming here, I asked his colleague. I used to self-centeredly believe that he appeared at 7:25 PM only because of me. Hey! Give it your best shot! Uncle, are you OK? I'm sorry. It's nothing. I think I want to go back here. Mr. Takei? The station is that way. The taxis are downstairs. Thank you. Your purse! Stay safe. He's fine. Are you hungry? I've already cooked. It's about time to buy cat food. Clean up quickly. You won't help him find peace and enlightenment like this. Chibi is already dead. How do you know? I just know. She didn't want you to see her in a pitiful state. Stop looking for her! I won't. I believe Chibi is still alive. Why don't you understand? It's because of this attachment that you can't let go. You're going too far. Why are you so heartless? answer me! What happened to Chibi? Chibi. Mom? Mom, what's wrong with you? You're completely soaked. Wait for me a moment. Are you okay? I'm fine. She'll sleep at my place. She's taking a bath now. Alright, goodbye. Is dad angry? No, he's just worried about you. This seems a bit too big. It suits you well. - Do you want some tea? - Mmm, yes. Are you okay? Mom, I... I don't want to go back to that house anymore. Why? Even if I go back, I'll still be all alone. Dad is there for you. It's because dad is there that I feel lonely. How should I put it? I might just die alone like this. - Mom, are you awake? - Mmm, yes. You can come here anytime, okay? Let me tell you, don't regret not getting married at all. Even if I remain single forever and never have children, it's okay. That way, you'll grow old all alone in the end. But still, like you, even after getting married, you feel lonely, right? You're right. Someday, I might feel lonely being single too. But even so, I won't regret my decision. Although my thoughts differ from my elder brother's, Whatever decision you make, i won't object. Mom, I have to go to the company now. I'll leave the keys with you. No need to clean the house for me. I won't do it. See you later. - See you later. - Goodbye. I'm sorry for suddenly canceling last time. It's okay. I was really worried if something happened to you. Actually, the last time... I experienced something terrifying. terrifying? Do you ever suddenly not recognize yourself? I have been in Tokyo for so long, about fifty years now. I live not far from here, and I don't even have to transfer trains. When the children were young, I used to take them to the department store rooftop in front of the station. This place is very familiar to me. But unexpectedly... When I walked on the overpass in front of the station that day I suddenly lost my way i don't know where to go I don't know which stairs to take So, I had to go up and down the stairs. back and forth on the pedestrian bridge several times. but still didn't know which way to go. I started feeling very scared. as if I were being swallowed by darkness. In the end, it was the police who told me the way so I could safely return home. And what about you today? I'm fine today. Did you tell your wife about this? No. Why not? I can't find the words to say it. You should tell her. I was planning to tell her... but recently our cat at home went missing and she's been preoccupied with that. Is that so? Whether it's good or bad, she must be eager to know everything about you and yet, you pretend not to share. That's just foolish. - Are you going home now? - Yes. Do you want to buy some chestnuts? I'll give you a discount. You really love eating chestnuts, don't you? It's my wife who loves eating them. But when your family comes to buy, they say it's for the dad. So, I thought you loved chestnuts the most. I'll buy some, thanks for the offer. These chestnuts are sweet and delicious. Here you go. Thank you for your custom. Welcome to come again. Have you calmed down now? Chestnuts. - Dad, I have something to tell you. - What is it? What's the matter? Please, let's get a divorce. I'm asking this favor of you. Thank you. Well... I'll stay at home today. -What? - Yeah. what are you knitting? Are you talking about this? It's a pair of gloves. You can just buy gloves from the store. Listen to me... that… I have something to do... This is the Takae residence. Yes. Thank you. I'll be right there. What's wrong? Someone saw a black cat that looked like Chibi near the elementary school back gate. They said there were flyers posted around the area, so it's probably not a mistake. I'll go check it out. Isn't it Chibi? No, it's a different cat. It's one that's been seen around there before. A black cat called Koku. I also know deep down that Chibi hasn't come back for so long because Chibi had already passed away. She's still alive. I've already prepared the bed for you. I know Chibi is getting old. She's already 13 years old. I had hoped that she would at least spend her final days at home. Why do you want a divorce? If you want a divorce, then let's do it. I just can't understand... what you're unhappy about. Actually, I already know. I know you've been meeting with Shizuko. Why didn't you tell me? - That's... - I already know. She used to like you a lot. I know all of these things. That's why I concealed the arranged marriage and silently quit my job. I took you away from that person because i love you that much. All I want is to be by your side. But... when our children grow up and leave home, it will be just you and me left in the house. I can't help but feel... that I'll be left doing all the cooking, cleaning, and doing laundry every day. Why should I work so hard? You never really listened to me seriously. You never turned back when I called you. I can't stand watching your back anymore. I'm asking you, Do you know what I think about every day? I entrust all the household matters to you... Not only that, but even the tiniest things. Since Chibi disappeared, I've felt so lonely and sad. Have you ever wanted to understand how I feel? Even if you don't, it's okay. I just… Hope you can share the same sentiments with me. Did you marry me out of reluctance because of the blind date? - No, it's not that. - Then why did you marry me? You were my first love, but you never... Told me you liked me. Do you like me? I have always cherished you. When I was young and had my first crush, But being a country bumpkin, I thought the other person wouldn't be interested in me. When I stood in front of her, I couldn't even look into her eyes. So I gave up pursuing her. Afterward, I decided to marry the first person I had a blind date with. I didn't even look at the blind date photo. But when I got there, I never expected that person to be sitting there, waiting for me. Why don't you tell me? I didn't know how to tell you. i don't want you to hate me. I could never hate you. because i love you so much. Why did you close that off? Chibi won't be able to come in. Red Bean Bread and Milk. Sure. Thank you for your visiting. You're back. Have you, Yukiko? Chibi is back. Good afternoon. - Hello. - Hello. The cat came back on its own. Is that so? Thank you for your help. Not at all. I didn't do anything. Do you want to play chess with me again? Sure. You should say "a game of chess." A game of chess, then. Actually, I want to turn that cat's story into a novel. Impressive. Will I appear in it too? Yes, you probably will. What should I do then? If you win against me, I'll let you write it. Can I use a flying chariot, side mover, and knight? Absolutely not! Please make your move. What are you doing? What? So cute. Is it lost or abandoned? Let's leave it at that. Why? We're getting old and won't be able to take care of it till the end. By the way, how about contacting that "Research" place? - You mean the pet detective? I'm not sure what it's called. There's something I want to tell you. What is it? I'll tell you when we get home. What could it be? I have something to tell you. So cute. Come on, it must be quite cold today.
