[accordion music] - [Man] Felix is from Modesto, California. He was born with a need to find something, that was not in those surroundings. [festive accordion music] - [Woman] The transition from Brian to Felix took place sometime during the Pratt School of Design. - I mean, I'm from a small town, I never met anyone like Felix. And he was from California, he'd been to Berkeley Law School, and maybe architecture school, but you know, just seemed very worldly, and when we first met, he was still very much into the powdered wigs, and he wore very long nails, I think he thought that was sort of like some kind of interesting tie-in to the Viennese turn of the century, style that he was mimicking at that time. Whatever that was. And it's not like he was in drag. I mean, I can't explain it. [cheerful classical music] - [Felix] I wrote my first letter to the Arch Duke when I was about 19 years old. I had never written a letter to anyone of great importance before. I was quite curious, what exactly a descendant of the Holy Roman Emperor's was doing in the late twentieth century, what exactly would make someone like that tick. How does one adjust to the late twentieth century of democratic republican politics, especially with the fall of the iron curtain, 1989. With this monarchical royal background? So I wrote him, asking him just that. I received an immediate response, I think it came within a week. Dear Dr. von Habsburg, Recently Sir Rodney Hartwell, of the Augustan Society, the historical organization of which we are both members, was kind enough to put me in touch with you. I am a student at UC Berkeley and my overwhelming interest in history is the former Habsburg Empire in Central Europe. Given events on the other side of the iron curtain in 1989, I wonder, how you are involved in developments there. Especially considering your work as a member of the European parliament. It would be so interesting for me to know how the Habsburg Dynasty is engaged with the vast region of it's former empire at this juncture in the 20th Century. In advance, I thank you, Sincerely, for the kindness of a response. With best wishes, yours, Brian Scott Pfeifle. [cheerful music] [upbeat music] [lively music] - I'm signing the papers to change my name from Brian Scott Pfeifle, Pfifly, or Pfifa, even Phifle, to Felix Etienne-Edouard Pfeifle. Etienne-Edouard being the french translation of my father's name, Steven Edward. So that would be my new middle name. So, in a way, I'm sort of becoming french. Do I have absolutely no french ancestry. - When did you want to be a Felix? He doesn't even look like a Felix. But I don't know what, I always think of Felix the Cat. - I really don't know who Felix Pfeifle is. I got to know him as Felix, as very erudite, very inter-continental person, who I could converse with on many scholarly topics, and who himself, wasn't an academic. He's apparently called Brian. I don't even see him as a Brian, I couldn't even imagine him as a Brian, which speaks well for reinvention and self-discovery, as far as I'm concerned, he's a Felix. - You never told me that you were going by Felix. - Well, I did. - You kept it to yourself. Five years later. - You kind of kept it to yourself. I still like the name Brian better. - It's hard to, I guess, really explain it sometimes. But that's why we love him. He's just so special. He's only one, Brian Felix. - How did it go? - Well, I think it was completely anti-climatic. Because, I just signed a piece of paper that took like 90 seconds, after having waited an hour and a half. And there was no, I thought that they were was going to be like this heralding chamberlain who would announce my new name. I thought that the judge would pound her gavel, and give me my new name. - There was no judge. - There's no judge. Just a court clerk and a bailiff. So, that's about it. - That was it? [lively harpsichord music] - Do you remember when Felix first talked about Otto von Habsburg? - Um, no, no. And I probably wasn't listening, to be honest with you. - What's his name? I can't even say it. - I don't know it, either. - My knowledge of Otto von Habsburg would be zero. - The Arch Duke. - Otto von Habsburg. - Yes. [upbeat harpsichord music] - [Felix] As the heir of the Austro-Hungarian empire, the Arch Duke, is also the heir of the Holy Roman Emperors, dating back to Charlemagne, dating back to the eight century. The Holy Roman Empire itself being founded, so to speak, on the ashes of the Roman empire. The Roman empire being a legacy of that empire of Alexander the Great. So, so, it's as if in, the Arch Duke, this person still living among us, I found the Holy Grail of European history, of European civilization dating back to say, the Greeks themselves. And at the turn of the twentieth century, there was a cultural renaissance at play, in Vienna, the future of the twentieth century was about to be shaked. And so all the figures of this last great moment in central European history, on the precipice of collapse, in 1918, the Arch Duke is the last surviving person of that era. - [Narrator] For seven centuries, Austria's house of Habsburg, was great among the living, today it's glories exist only among the dead. It was the murder at Sarajevo, of Patos, grand-uncle, grand Ferdinand, which touched off the world war, then, mid-way of the war grand Josef funeral cortage wound through Vienna, and Otto, a toddling baby boy, marched behind it, between a new emperor, and empress. Carl and Vita, now as other Habsburgs die to their last rites, goes Carl's son, young bearer of the proudest name in royal annuals, Otto of Habsburg. [knock, knock] - Hi. - Hi. - C'mon in. - Okay. - So why don't you tell me that dream, from the beginning, tell me everything that you saw and heard and can remember. - I dreamed that, I'm on my way to the audience with the Arch Duke, and I'm dressed beautifully. Befitting an audience with the prince, and I have to go to a Belgium castle at the top of a hill, I'm going up by myself, but then all these village children start streaming around me in traditional world peasant dress. As I go across the drawbridge, Arch Duke Otto is there, but I noticed that there are photographers every where. It occurs to me, that my appointment with the Arch Duke, is nothing more than a photo opp for him, with the Belgium royal family, and these village kids. And I am really disappointed. [animated music] - There's a part of you that, I think as you are drawn to the figure of Otto Von Habsburg, because he is a member of the aristocracy, and because there's something in you that's drawn to the aristocracy. And maybe you have fear coming from a more peasant background. That you'll be discovered as a peasant, revealed, as a fraudulent aristocrat. Almost like Otto, himself. A king without a country. [traffic noises] - Heavenly father, I thank you for this day, thank you for Brian being with us. Thank you for our food, bless it to our bodies, in your name we pray, Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Yeah, it's true. - Huntington's disease is a genetic late onset nerve degenerative disease. Even though the disease processes may be in play very early on, the outward manifestations, the symptoms and signs, don't come on until, late 30s or early 40s. - [Terry] Some people with Huntington's just struggle with the movement part, other people have really bad nerve psychiatric problems. Behavior changes, personality changes, rages, impulsivity, temper outbursts, sometimes suicidality, sometimes homicidality. - Felix's dad has had a challenging time with all three. - He had loaded guns in the house. - Yes. - Pistols that were loaded. Guns in the closet, guns under the bed, and we never knew whether he might actually use one. - [Woman] Felix's great-great grandmother suffered from Huntington's disease. And passed it down to his great-grandmother. Who passed it on to his grandfather, who in turn, passed it on to his Aunt Patty. And his father, Steven. - [Man] One of the things that bothers Huntington's patients the most is the lost of executive function. Nobody likes to be told you're losing your marbles. You're not going to be able to make decisions that are so necessary for everyday life. Everything from balancing your checkbook to deciding when to walk across the street. - [Mother] Steve, come back. Steve? - In the U.S., it's estimated that there are between 35 thousand and 50 thousand people affected with Huntington's disease. But those numbers are hard to get out for a couple of reasons. One is, people don't want to be found. And, many times, because of the stigma, of this disease, families don't want it known. - I'm sure that Felix must have mentioned Huntington's disease when we were at Pratt, when we were young. I may have not been able to process it as something that was scary like that at that time. So, it might just be me, but, I feel like I didn't really know about it, until we were living in Los Angeles, and his father started, you know, really getting worse. And that's when he started therapy. It was a really, really rough spot. And then, it just, he kind of stopped talking about it. - Living at risk and seeing that happening in your family, you know what hell is like, and you know what suffering is like. And, you learn not to sweat the small stuff. Why would you? - I think the horrifying part of it for him, is when going to see his family, and being so devastated to the point of sometimes when he comes back for a week, he's somewhat catatonic. - I've noticed that nobody knows about Huntington's. - It's not something that I think of as a secret. It's just something that I don't share with my friends. Unless, they come from my childhood. I don't know why. I don't know. - There's a lot of risk to coming out about this. Because unfortunately, there are people who are very judgemental. So if you out yourself, you take the risk that people then define you by the disease. - Brian has a 50/50% chance of getting it, and so does Shelly, have a 50/50% of getting it. I've chosen to believe in what I think God has chosen for them is that neither one of Shelly or Brian will have it - [Mom] I'm not going to be concerned about the children. It's 50/50, the flip of a coin. [light music] - [Felix] When I was in college, I received a letter about an article I had published in a historical journal. The letter was from a Hubert Hinkel, who professed himself to be a fan of all things Habsburg and Austrian. I thought, oh, now he's a bit dappy. And so we began a correspondence that lasted a few years. Until Herbert Hinkel died. Afterward, a large package arrived on my doorstep. It contained nearly sixty years of letters between Herbert Hinkel and the last crown prince of the Austrian-Hungarian empire, Arch Duke Otto von Habsburg. Herbert had left the archive to me in his will. And I call it, my imperial archive. It's in full form right now. And, it's fullest form, yet, because I've added, a couple of pieces, pieces of my own. There's a lithograph of the imperial crypt where the Habsburg's are buried in Vienna. And then, there is the imperial residence, the Hofburg. Those were mine, otherwise, all this stuff, came from Herbert Hinkel. - He received the imperial archive really early in school, and I remember when he got it, I mean, it was a big deal. - He moved from San Francisco to my apartment in Los Angeles and with him, carried this box of memorabilia he had collected over the years, including the letters between the correspondence between Herbert Hinkel, and Otto von Habsburg. - Felix hired me to organize the imperial archive. He basically gave me this worn box, that the archive had been traveling around in for a number of years, and all of these very important papers were just in the box. And basically he wanted someone to take the archive, to organize it, and to make sure that it was protected for posterity. - With Felix, I believe that it's an aesthetic quest. Which is tied in strongly into his whole notion of looking for history that's missing. And of course to understand the entire concept of how these three men interact, one has to understand that history is a fiction. For Felix, there is that recognition of the myth, and the appreciation of it, but also the desire to understand something tangible. Something personal in the history. [light music] - Herbert Hinkel's relationship to the Arch Duke, I think, was in reality never fulfilled. The letters lasted about 60 years, but it's pretty evident that Herbert Hinkel actually never met the Arch Duke, and I thought that in so far, that Hinkel had left me the archive, which in reality, was the opening to this personal portal to the Arch Duke himself. I had an obligation to fulfill Herbert Hinkel's dreams. [light music] for someone to have left me something so dear to him, and without having met Herbert Hinkel personally myself. I had to get as close to him as I could to satisfy my curiosity. [light music] So I set out to trace the lives between the letters. [subway clangs] Coincidentally, when I started this journey, I was the same age as my father when he first started showing signs of Huntington's disease. I imagined there was a sudden subconscious fear that I needed to embark on this before it was too late for me. Is that Herbert Hinkel, you think? - I think so, yes. - Oh, I see, the history of the von Mulllenbuher, von Hinkel family. - Have you read it? - Not closely at all. - Herbert Hinkel mentions that in one of the letters, his family has been in the service of the Habsburg's dating back to 1438. - Oh really? - Showing that his loyalty survives in the United States. You know, on this side of that land. - It's interesting that he's always alone in every photo. - Yeah. - He was always so mysterious. - What do you suppose this is? - Mrs. Currie? - Why would he be holding someone else's wife in a portrait, though? [laughter] - I don't ask questions like that. - Well, I have to. - If you look at why someone like Herbert Hinkel, a very average well-educated American, would carry on a decades long correspondence with the Arch Duke of Austria-Hungry, a crown prince, Otto, becomes for Herbert Hinkel, a man that represents a lost chivalry, that respects the modern era, but at the same time, seeks for a conduit, to a lost and forgotten past that Hinkel finds relevant and important not only to himself, but to the world, then there's Felix Pfeifle, who is an estet, who has studied Austrian history and culture. Who is very much taken by the importance of what was developed before the first world war, and what was lost with the first world war. [subway rumbles] - His name was Herbert Hinkel, and was friends with the last crown prince of the Austrian empire. - What side, what building did he live in? - 184. Herbert Hinkel lived in this area, in Sullivan County, New York, actually in a place called Parksville, but apparently there's nothing in Parksville. I'm just trying to find someone who lived on what was then called, Neville's Eske Road in the 1970s. His name was Herbert Hinkel. Do you know the name? Okay. - I don't know. - And that creates a triangle of three men, who, who are concerned with identity and reinvention. Who want to connect with a past that has been pushed aside, by a myth-making or myth-controlling history. As Herbert Hinkel did in his very personal way. And as Otto from Habsburg does in his very political way. And as Felix Pfeifle does in his very aesthetic and almost, well, let's say it, an iconoclastic post-modern way. Stepping into areas that are not politically correct. Ripping open the seams of hidden vistas, that connecting desire to move history into some realization of that which isn't recorded. - Oh my God, okay. So, Herbert Hinckel did not own a 48 acre estate, in Parksville, New York, as he said to the Arch Duke that he did. I am, none the less, going to try and find people in that hamlet there, who may have known him. [traffic grinds] I'm looking for someone who lived in Parksville in the 1970s His name was Herbert Hinkel. You don't know? - No. Have you lived in Parksville a while? - Oh, about eight years. - Oh, just eight, all right. So, okay, well maybe I'll just order a cheeseburger then. Herbert Hinkel claimed in these letters that I have, that he owned a 48 acre estate on Castle Hill Road. He had this correspondence for about 60 years with this Austrian prince, and they have this, they had a long, for like six decades, from the 1930's to the 1990's, the prince wrote to him, and he wrote back. So he tells the prince in his letters that he had this big estate here. So I came to see what it looks like, and now I can't find it - Oh, I see. - I think he was looking for something larger and finer, and gilded, and there it was. But beyond Habsburg, is the very fair sense of justice, that Felix has knowing that there is another story out there equally compelling, and it's Hinkel. And Hinkel is a nobody. Absolute nobody. But here he is, as counter-weight to Habsburg, he can see the relationship and how rich it is, and how doubly weighted it is. Like a mobile art piece, done by Arp or Calder, like one thing can be blue, you know in this shape, another thing yellow, and that shape, but they have to be, they have to be hanging, and tied in by these strings, and he's one of these people who makes these strings. [light music] - I'm looking for someone who lived on Castle Hill Road. And his name was Herbert Hinkel? - All right, - Do you know the name? - He lived with Brahm? - That's it! - They moved up from Long Island, they moved there, and then, the Brahms, there was two brothers, Mike and Tony, and Joey and Robert. And then Tony moved to Florida, his family moved down there because his uncle had a lot of money, they lived off the uncle, really. - The uncle being Herbert Hinkel? - They lived off his money. - And he had a lot of money? - Yeah. - By the way, do you know that house number? - Well you can't miss it, In case I don't. - Once you get to the top of the hill, if you start down on the other side, it's a dead end road. Then you went by my place and theirs. - You know, I've been here already 65 years, if not more. And there was no Herbert Hinkel on this road at all. - You know, I don't know of anybody really new came on this road. I mean, I know of him, and I may have met him once. - Really? - But that's about it, yeah, okay. - But he never lived here. You're looking to find a, what is, something from Europe, or whatever, wherever he came from? - Well, I'm trying to find out what kind of life Herbert Hinkel had. Like where did he live, and who knew him? - For what reason, though, what kind of person, what, what was he, a doctor, a lawyer, what was he going to be? - I know, he was just someone, he was a property manager, an average American who wrote letters to the last crown prince of the Austria-Hungarian empire. And Herbert Hinkel had this, almost life-long exchange of letters with him. I am getting mixed reports everywhere. Everyone I run into, has something different to say about Herbert Hinkel and the Brahm-- Oh, here it is! Right here! This the yellow house with brown trim. Apparently this is exactly where he lived. [lively old European music] Just as I thought to myself, that I'd been the custodian to Herbert Hinkel's dreams, I wondered about where my father stood in my dreams. And although he's still alive, he's been a shadowy presence in my life. And somehow, I just have to jettison those anxieties. [car rumbles] Six, two, two, two, five. Six, oh, there it is. - Hi! - Hi, nice to met you, finally - Nice to meet you. - He was always in my life. He always lived with us, as if he were a second dad. - This is why Herbert Hinkel is mysterious to me, because you were his family, although you weren't really related to him. And so, I always wondered, you know, who was his family? - You know, we never really met his family. - When I think of my childhood, only thing I can remember is him, holding me, and no one else. - We always felt that he would always be around. He was like a second dad. - Ladies and gentlemen, I think that anything that happens, Tony would really pale against that. The wonderful ceremony we have today. [Interviewer] - Tony do you have any insight into why he chose your family over his own? - Me, [chuckles], me. You know, I mean, it's the way we met. You know, I helped him. To him, I saved his life. We did everything together. Went out to eat, we went to movies. And it was no sexual thing, I mean don't get me wrong. I don't go near any men. [laughter] But, um, we just hit it off, and we stayed together. [harmonica music] - Herbert Hinkel, 72, was on his way to work at a nearby Costco store, when he was hit by a 1987 Toyota Camry. Oh, I think he was jay walking. I went into Costco and asked if there were someone who might had known Herbert Hinkel, and in fact, the woman with whom I was speaking, his supervisor, knew him, and she remembers him being killed in front of the store. She said that in the back of the store, they planted a tree for him, and that there's a plaque there in memory of Herbert Hinkel. [harmonica music] That's the wrong plaque, I think the supervisor got him confused with Beverly Miller, or Beverly Miller's planted as Hubert Hinkel. [harmonica music] I have to say that when the family told me about his funeral, what moved me the most, was when they said that the hearse was driven by, the coffin was driven by, Costco, by the front of Costco And then in front of the entire store, which they had closed down, especially for that moment, the hundred or so employees of Costco, came out to salute Herbert Hinkel. This is so sweet. I just about melted, because in it's own way, it's Herbert's royal send off. You know? Herbert seemed like truly such a rich person, and his truly quirky way, and ultimately such a Mench. [serene horn music plays] Poor Herbert. [bee buzzes] - Felix called me up and said, I would really like you and Boris to come to the first meeting I have with the genetic counselor to decide whether I'm going to take a test to find out whether I have Huntington's. I think him being Boris' god-father, has that, sort of represents that he is this person, that will not be genetically pre-disposed to Huntington's, so there's a kind of delight that he shares in that, and that he's family, but he's not sort of tainted by this horrifying thing. - [speaking in a foreign language]. - [Michelle] Predictive Huntington's testing means that you don't have any symptoms and you're at 50/50 risk for developing Huntington's disease, and you want to know if you have the gene. - We all carry Huntington's gene. Everyone has two, you got one from your Mom, you got one from your Dad. And so, people who actually have Huntington's disease, one of those, they're called alleles, on the chromosome, is a expanded. So when that expansion occurs, you get the disease. Yes, no, that's it. Black and white. - [Matthew] There's a baseline fear there. Do I have this illness. And do I want to know if I have it? I've seen Felix go from being okay with dealing with it, to not okay. - [Friend] There was a part of him that was slightly self-destructive. Thinking at the end of the day, if I have it, I'm gonna die, and I'm gonna have a horrible life, so why not taste that darkness a little bit? - [Friend] This is badness. - In New York? - No, in, Austria. - Oh. - Did you paint this? - Yeah. - I don't remember this. My very first Habsburg dream, I dreamt that I was in the imperial vault in Vienna, when the family was burying the empress, and there is in Vienna, this ancient imperial vault, where almost all the Habsburgs are buried. [upbeat harpsichord music] - [Felix] The family is standing there. In total silence. In front of them, is the coffin of the empress. I'm on the other side looking at them. But I'm invisible to them. [upbeat harpsichord music] [applause] - I want to thank you so much for coming tonight. It's really special to me that you can be here. This fund raiser is to provide seed money, I've been working for the last year to get an appointment with the Arch Duke, and I finally nailed him down for 2 o'clock September 5th, [applause] - Unsure whether this is a Hinkel or a Habsburg crowd that I'm addressing, [laughter] but we've got to give, we got to dig deep, we've got to do it for Herbert Hinkel, and we've got to do it for Felix Pfeifle, thanks. [applause] - All right! - Madness. [applause] [cheerful music] - I have two suits. There's this suit, and this suit, also apropos Austria. - I don't know, what do you think? All rose for me, feedback. There is this suit as well. - I think that's more evening. Yes. - Um, I think it is, this is the one, - I think it is, just because I think of, in terms of color. Oh my God, I never seen so many ties in my life. - Okay, so, - Boring. - Two, - Boring. - That's Boring. That's a little bit more fun. - Dr. Habsburg always wears printed ties, Nice! - Sweets, what about this? That's nice, and this one, too. - Isn't that beautiful? No bow tie? - You know what, I think that would look really smashing. Oh, that's perfect. - Oh that's right, we don't care about whether that's the outside. - Nope. [lively music] [cute traditional waltz music] - I don't know it's coincidental prose it is, but in any case, all roads seem to lead back to Vienna for me. The nickname, of Austria, historically, has been Felix Austria. And that dates back, to about the 16th century, when the Habsburgs were expanding their world empire, through pivotal strategic marriages. - [Airport Announcer] [speaking in a foreign language] - Someone said, in Latin, may all others wage war. But you, happy Austria, will marry, that is, in Latin, [speaking in a foreign language] [Austrian operatic singing] - I miss that guy's voice, the street tram voice. [speaking in a foreign language] That was the voice I heard every day. [Austrian operatic singing] It's so exciting to be here in Vienna, finally. And also, at the Cafe [speaking in a foreign language] where I used to come as a student, when I lived here. And, have goulash again with paprika. And German as they say, [speaking in a foreign language]. Which sort of means, the place where your heart or soul resides, and Vienna is certainly like that for me, and I haven't been here in 12 years. I feel like I haven't been home, or I neglected to visit my mother for over ten years. [classic music] This is Gustave Klimt's portrait of Fritza Riedler. And, what I like about it, is behind Mrs. Riedler's head, you can see this headdress where he literally quotes, the Vilascas' portraits of the Spanish Habsburg princesses. These are Vilascas' portraits of the Spanish Habsburgs, which became iconic images of the baroque era. The Vilascas' portraits are also iconic depictions of the Habsburgs because it captures them at the height of their power when they ruled Spain in the New World, but also it captures them at a moment where their inner breeding furiously with each generation you can see that the family becomes a little bit more degenerate looking. For instance, here's Phillip, the fourth king of Spain. His jaw and his lip are the Habsburg jaw and lip. They're becoming a very unhandsome lot. Finally, by 1700, the Spanish branch died out, because as they have inner bred so many times, that had made the males in the family impotent. Genes work in mysterious ways. [operatic music] I don't understand the complexity of one's genes, but I'm reminded of the journey I've been on, and the question I had to face. I went to one appointment about getting tested for Huntington's. I thought that I was really ready to confront it all, I was just so clear about it. And after that one appointment, I never went back. But I feel confident that I don't have it. Well, pretty confident. [classic music] [horse clip-clops] I just woke up, and I can't get back to sleep. And, I just realized, why. I dreamt that I'm in Otto von Habsburg's library. - Good afternoon, Heir Pfeifle. - Good afternoon, Dr. Von Habsburg. - I'm glad you could join me this afternoon. I have something which may be of interest to you. - The Arch Duke unfurls this gorgeous leather banner that depicts the code of arms from his 57 imperial and royal titles. - Heraldry, almost reads like a map of European history. History and maps are so very important. Probably you know that we had the tradition of maintaining all the shields of our dominions in one coat of arms over the course of the second millennium, there are 57 here. Here, for instance, are the [speaking in a foreign language] Which became Spain. We ruled there from the late 15th century to the early 18th during Spain's golden era, of course. [lively music] [shirt rustles] - I wonder what we should do about, maybe I should call him and see if we could film there with, or should we just go? [iron thumps] Oh, no! Oh, shit! [piano music] - How's our position? I know Dr. von Habsburg looks well situated, am I okay? - [Camera Person] Yeah, okay. - Can I turn just a little toward him? - [Camera Person] Yeah. - So, is that okay? - But aren't you then uncomfortable? - I'm okay. - Well, I could tell you so many stories. And they are all interesting, uninteresting, They've of the past, including some with some supernatural things. - As you may know, part of the reason I came today, is because of this wonderful archive of letters I have of yours from Herbert Hinkel. - Hinkel, yes. - Well, it's nearly sixty years of letters that I have. - Yes. Starting in 1937. What would be the interest in writing someone like Herbert Hinkel, who is a fairly ordinary American. - Certainly. Nowadays, few people answer their letters anymore. But today, it is a simple act of question of courtesy, and respect to somebody who takes the trouble to write to you, that you have to write back. [lively music] Well, I would tell you, of course, when I go back as far as I can, it's always politics. [quiet chattering] [lively music] - [Felix] The Archduke and the Duchess were assassinated right about here, or? - Right here. - In the car? - A little bit over. - Just over on the bridge. - Just right here. [lively music] - [Otto] All I was doing, was always a question of survival. As soon as I started, really, to develop, there was already the fight for the homeland. Because I had a homeland. I still have it somehow, at the bottom of my heart. - Can you describe your families' last moments? At Schonbrunn Palace? During the revolution? - Well it was a very dark day. No electric light anymore. You moved in darkness. There were some young soldiers standing still in front, to protect my father. My father, then, he insisted that they should go home. And I have read at some point, that your mother, the Empress, was determined to stay, and not to renounce the throne, - Yes. Even in the face of danger. - She was a very courageous person, you know. And she just said, we can't. And well, afterwards, we couldn't. [upbeat music] - It was a nice coup that you liberated here. - Oh, yeah. [laughter] - You see, Hitler was always interested in taking Austria. He hated the Habsburgs from the beginning. Because as he wrote in his Mein Kampf incidentally, that the Habsburgs were friendly with the Jews, friendly with the gypsies, and so on. [lively music] - Why did you change your identify to Dr. von Habsburg? - Because it was easier to achieve what I wanted to achieve. You know, the title is something in the present situation, which faced a lot of problems. [lively music] - [Felix] So the people who honor their history have a future? - Yes, exactly. And those who forget it, have none. - Have a problem. Exactly. [footsteps] - I think it's over here. I just really enjoyed being with Otto von Habsburg. It was actually fascinating to see how much time in a day he could devote to his public presence and public duties, as it were. Oh, it was completely exhausting. There were a couple of moments where I thought about Herbert Hinkel, and I thought, oh, Herbert Hinkel. If he could only see me now. - Dad, look, here, what's today? - I don't think he knows. - Do you know, what is, do you know what today is? - It's father's day. - It's Sunday today. June 19th. - Can you open it? - You are probably gonna have to read it to him. - Mm-hm. - Good, Dad. - Can you read that, Dad? - Okay, good. - That's a cute dog. There you go. Okay we have to go to the restroom. C'mon. C'mon, Dad. C'mon, Dad. [birds chirping] - [Melanie] I went to a Huntington's seminar, or a guess it's not called a seminar, but an educational meeting at UC Davis with the Pfeifle family. And, I have to say, that it wasn't a pretty picture. And that you could see them all at different stages. And I know for Shelly and Brian to look at that, and know that they might have it, and look head on at something they might have to deal with, is, you know, not an easy thing to do. [accordion music] [door clicks] - My uncle's boyfriend had been murdered, and I dreamt that I was with my uncle, and an elaborate funeral cortege, and my uncle seemed to be the principal mourner. And, I realized that Eddie, my uncle's boyfriend, was a Habsburg. And, my uncle, therefore, has inherited his rights, and, in so far that my uncle does not have children, and I'm the next of kin, as it were, I am, therefore his heir, and the heir. The ultimate heir. - Let's put together the fascination with the Habsburgs. The idea of your own inner sovereignty, and the feeling of apartness, that I think stems from a history of differentness. - If, in this dream, I feel I am the heir, and therefore the future sovereign, you know, but, perhaps it's about, finding my inner sovereignty, you know, my command of my own life. [traffic hums] [beeping] - Hi. - Hello, good morning. You didn't tell me that Dad was in the hospital. Oh, honey, I'm sorry. Well, he seems to come unhinged every holiday. But now mother said that he's in restraints. Uh. Okay, thank you, bye. He did actually have the presence of mind to respond to the nurse when she said, "Steven, where are you?" And he said, I'm in the nut house. So he does understand. Otto von Habsburg fell down the stairs headfirst in his house and isn't recovering well. He is after all, 97 years old. And, I don't know if my father is going to come out of the hospital. And so, I don't know how much time I might have left. [quiet music] I recently talked to a psychic. Which I don't usually do [chuckles]. I don't usually talk to psychics. I don't even know if I believe a word they say, but I did. I had an appointment with one. And I asked him, because I have gotten word that the Arch Duke would probably not be living much longer. And because this journey has assumed a very important, if not, nearly dominate role in my life, I asked the psychic what he thought might happen with my engagement of the Arch Duke's legacy after Otto dies. And, the response from the psychic is that when he dies, it dies. Which was surprising to me. So, that's where it hangs right now. That's at least the psychic's opinion, so. [reflective music] [lamp clicks] [lamp clicks] [monitor speaking in foreign language] - I'm watching the live coverage from Vienna of the funeral of Otto von Habsburg, It's a five hour program. [dramatic classical music] [monitor speaking in foreign language] - They're on the panel of three experts, is the author of [speaking in a foreign language], Black Book of the Habsburgs. It's a book about the black sheep in the Habsburg family. And he's on here as sort of a Habsburg expert. When really, I should be, on that panel. I just haven't written a book. [dramatic operatic vocals] [singing in foreign language] [dramatic classical music] - It is interesting for me to be sitting here watching this, as they walk the last mile with Otto. I think that's a beautiful ritual in funerals that isn't done very much any more where you walk the last mile with that person. And here, it's being done, and even though I'm not there, I'm glad to know that I walked that last mile with Otto von Habsburg the last ten years in my engagements with him, and formed the connection that I had with him that was really meaningful. [classical operatic vocals] [lamp clicks] What happened to that shirt? And why do I only have one white shirt? Oh here, here it is. This is disgusting, that's gross. Shoot, I can't find a proper white shirt to wear to this memorial mass today at the Hungarian Church in Los Angeles, so, I'm gonna have to jury-rig this tuxedo shirt. Look at this, I don't even have matching anything. But I'll cover it up with the tie. So you won't even see the-- Stupid things-- Oh my gosh, what a sad looking church. What if no one is there? Oh well. - [Priest] I have come to believe that you are the Messiah, the son of God, he who is to come into the world. The Gospel of the Lord. Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ. [Praying in a foreign language] - I am trying to reach Tatiana, because I have had a, it's been an especially difficult past week, not because Otto von Habsburg died, but because just a number of projects that were supposed to come through for me have not, and I'm just on the verge of having to regroup in a very serious way, and I'm considering just going back to Modesto for awhile. It's not pretty. I can pay this right here and get a sticker? - This one, no. No. - Why? Delinquent. My most frequent callers of creditors. It's interesting that this whole chapter with Otto's death literally in the last week, and me feeling like on some level I'm finished with Los Angeles. It's not giving back to me right now. This city, and I think it's a good time to be away from it. Also, as it happens, a good time to help my mother. The last several months have been especially difficult for my whole family and for my mother, where my father is concerned. And I know she needs my help, I know she wants my company so much. She's so alone there. So it would be a good time to take a break from Los Angeles. 70, look at that. That's me, that's me. Now, the amount that's listed there, is that because it includes all my parking tickets? $763? So much money. The fees. Wore out the door. Ah, a thousand, forty-eight. It's because I waited so long to pay them, that they just-- All right, am I supposed to move the car or something? Why isn't anyone parked over there any more? Just because I waited so long to pay them. And they just, they increased exponentially, just, it's insane, insane. Ah! I don't even, don't want to talk about it. [harmonica music] [cheerful music]
