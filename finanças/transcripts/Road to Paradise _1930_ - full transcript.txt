- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes - Hello, Jerry. - Hello, Jim. - Is Nick here? - He's in there now. Thanks, Jim. - Hello, Nick. - Hello. You look all in, what have you been doing? - Been to an auction. - Auction? Yeah, picked up a few trinkets. You fool. Oh, I forgot to tell you. Mary's coming down tonight. - Mary? - Yeah, she phoned. Better let her hear you barking like that. She'll want to put you to bed and nurse you for a couple of weeks. Now, listen, Jerry, don't tell her I was in the hospital. She'll only worry about it. Do you remember how she used to fuss over us when we all lived together? I'll say I do. You know, Nick, we made a rotten job raising that kid. Well, we done the best we could for her, didn't we? We was like a father and mother to her, wasn't we? Yes, but we didn't use the right system. Why, Mary's got a streak of honesty a yard wide that we never got out of her. Oh, but it's good to see you again! Thanks. Say, have Nick and Jerry been around? - They're both in that room now. - Thanks, Lola. I'll be in in a minute. Here's a dame comes in on the boat, she's going down the gangplank and she's got all the luggage with her, and a couple of guys grab them bags and she starts squawking. And there ain't a cop in sight, now you can't get that, can you? Hello, boys. - Why, Mary! - Hello, Jerry. Gee, it's good to see you, Mary. It's like a day in the country. - Did you really miss me? - I hope to tell you. When you left us, you took all our love with you. - Well, it didn't follow me any. - No? - Here, sit down. - Yeah, sit, sit down, Mary, sit down. Well, how do you like working at the coffee store? - I quit three weeks ago. - Yeah? - Why? - The same old thing. The manager got fresh. Hid did? Say, listen, where is that guy's store? What's his name, where's he working at? Nick, it's not going to do me any good to have you go and take a poke at him. Well, it's gonna do me a lot of good, see? But what have you been doing since? Oh, nothing, Jerry, just answering a lot of want ads. Aw, gee, Mary, you ought to let us know. Oh, I just couldn't, Nick, I was ashamed. You know how I bragged so much about going to work and everything. I never could understand this hankering for respectability. - It all seems to me kind of morbid. - Yeah. Lola, it's great to have Mary back again, isn't it? Oh, you bet. How've you been? I've been just fine, Lola. Nick, has that cough been bothering you again? No, no... It ain't bothering me at all, Mary, it... It's the cigarette with... some smoke got down my throat. You're lying to me. No, I ain't lying to you, Mary. Now, you might as well tell me the truth because you know I'll find out. Listen, I'm telling you the truth, Mary. I'm perfectly alright, honest I am. Oh, now, listen, put that gag away, will you? I tell you that I'm alright. I'm alright. - Nick, listen to me. - Leave me alone, Mary. Jerry, make her lay off of me, will you? - Look at me, Nick. - I won't do it. - Look at me, Nick! - I don't want to. Nick... look at me. Say, what's she trying to do to Nick? She's reading his mind. What? You've been in a hospital. You were in a fight and one of your ribs were broken. Oh, Nick, that's terrible! You should have let me know and I could have done something. Oh, it's nothing. Why don't you leave me alone? Do you mean to tell me that you got that out of his mind? - Yes, Lola. - And you didn't know it before? Why, no. - Why, I don't see how... - I inherited it, I guess. You see, my mother was psychic. She could read letters that she'd never seen. She could find out anything she wanted to know. But of course I'm not as clever as that. And that, is that a charm? Well, I don't know how much charm it is, but I've worn it ever since I can remember. When I get in a tight place, I just hold it... ...and repeat the words that are on it over and over again. Words, what words? Each to each in spirit mate. When in danger trust to fate. Well... I'm glad that you and me are just mere acquaintances. Why, one wouldn't have the least bit of privacy. - There we are. - Thank you. Oh, Wang Lang. Hey, have some of that chicken Chow Mein. - That sounds good, chicken Chow Mein. - One chicken Chow Mein. - Hm, I'll have the same. - You have the same. - Make it three. - Make it three. - And don't put any seagulls in it. - We don't use seagulls. Right this way, lady. Upsy-daisy! You know I'm quite capable of getting out of my car... ...without your making those ridiculous noises? Sorry, lady, no offense. Right this way, people. Oh, what a bond salesman he would make. - Here we are, Margaret. - Oh, isn't this nice, George. Yes, it's quite thrilling, isn't it? Ladies and gents, this is a genuine resort of the underworld, where crooks, desperadoes, gunmen and dope pedlars... ...rub shoulders in an atmosphere of crime. Right this way, folks. Come on. Well, well, well. - Look it over, folks. - Oh, what a weird place. Another one of them slumming parties. You know, they make me sick. They come over here and look the place over as though it was a sewer. But, boy, it costs them plenty. - I'm gonna beat it. - Lola, close the curtain, will you? I don't want anybody watching while I'm eating. Oh. If there's anything I hate it's to be watched while I eat. It don't make no difference to me. I'd eat in Chow's window if I could get it regular. Hey, Charlie. Bring up some more chairs here. The Chinese have a marvelous serpent dance in the streets, you know. you know,the Chinese Serpent dance? Well, that wasn't so bad. Gee, you shouldn't eat so fast, Jerry, you'll get indigestion. Or you're 21. Well, it's rather still here tonight, Flanagan, isn't it? Why, we've been here five minutes and there hasn't been anyone shot yet. It's a little early yet. But you'd better keep your hand on your watch. Thanks, I will. Say, lady, would you like to do a little twister with me? Twister? Sure, a twirl. Oh, you mean dance. - Yeah! - No, thank you. That's alright, I just thought I'd ask. Say, I got to get some cigarettes. Don't get scared, though. I'll be right back. All right, Flanagan. I'll try to take care of them till you get back. Got a cigarette, Dick? No, I'm just fresh out, Jerry. - Well, I'll get some. - Get me a packet, will you? Right, sure. Yes, I thought it was rather cute the way she took it out of his vest pocket. George would think her cute anyway. How can she do these things, George? - George. - Oh, can I help you, Margaret? - Yes, George, but don't drop it. - All right. What's the matter, Jerry? What are you looking at? Is there anything I can do for you? I beg your pardon. - Did you see that girl? - What girl? - Sitting ut there with her back to you. - No, why? Take a look. Now then, let's talk about something interesting. - Margaret here, for instance. - That is a charming subject. Thank you, Mrs. Wells. Well, I think I'll propose again. How about it, Margaret? Oh, please, George, it's so... so public. When we're alone, you never give me a break. Say, for the love of Mike, am I seeing things? Why, she looks more like me than I do myself. I know, it's incredible. I wonder who she is. I don't know, but I'm going to find out. Don't be silly. Why should I make you miserable? Oh... miserable. I think you and I would jog along very nicely together. Mother thinks so too, don't you, Mother? Really, I don't blame Margaret for not accepting you. You know, your plea is not exactly impassioned. Let me tell you, George. The trouble with you is you don't really love me. I've never seen anyone that I liked any better. And Mother likes you too, don't you, Mother? Well, that's awfully sweet of both of you. But what is it about me that you like so well? I'll tell you. I like your disposition. I like your complexion. I like your eyes. I like your hands, and above all... I'm crazy about the way you wear your hair. Well, that's all very well and good, George, but some day you're going to meet a girl, you're going to like her disposition, her eyes, her complexion, her pretty hands and her hair... ...just as well as you do mine. But besides all that, there's going to be a wonderful electric something, I... I don't know how to describe it, but it will be there. And when you propose to her, you won't say, "Oh, we'll jog along very nicely together." No. And it won't a make any bit a difference... ...whether your mother likes her or not. You'll marry her just the same. Evidently, Margaret, you mean no again. Yes, George, I mean no. However, you're still wearing my ring, and that's a good sign. Just a habit. If I ever change towards you, I'll take it off. If you ever do, Margaret, I'll propose to you again. - Did you see those pearls? - Did I? And them rocks. - Was it as thrilling as you expected? - Oh, yes! Hey, folks, there's a joint down the block. It's a little tougher than this. And I thought maybe you'd like to take it in. - Let's go. - How thrilling. Come on, everybody, let's go. - Here you are, Margaret, let me help you. - Thank you. Better step on it, it's pretty hard to get a seat down there. Hey, Flanagan. Who's that girl? Which one? The one that was sitting here in the peach-colored dress. Oh, that's Margaret Waring. The old man died and left her a lot of jack. Got a swell joint up on 82nd St. just off the Avenue. You know, lots of cut glass, and silver. The rugs come right up to your knees. Why? Oh, nothing. Thank you, Flanagan, see you soon. Well, what did you find out? - Plenty. - Yeah? Say, what are you two figuring? Now, Mary, just use your imagination. Here's a girl with a big house, and jewels and all kinds of money. Supposing one day when she's out... I just couldn't, Jerry. Oh, she looks so sweet and so nice and... Oh, anybody can look sweet and nice with all kinds of money. Why, you wouldn't look so bad yourself in this girl's clothes. Gee, that... that sure was a good-looking fellow with her. Believe me, I wouldn't give him the air. You know, Mary, they never did do a good job on me down at that hospital. - Good morning, Grover. - Good morning. Is this the Waring residence? - Yes, sir. - I'm City Inspector Bartledge. Come to check the electric wiring. This way, sir. There you are, sir. Is everything on this board? Lights, bells, burglar alarms and so on? We have no burglar alarms. Oh, you should have. They're a great protection. Well, I'll tell you, sir. It was this way. Miss Margaret did think of having one put on the scene. But what with one thing and another, she never got around to it. You see, this is a very old-fashioned house. We have old-fashioned ways. Why, I myself have been here for twenty years. Well, I can't imagine anybody staying in one place for twenty years. Except perhaps in jail. Gee, I... I wish I'd never agreed to this. Don't get cold feet now, Mary. Now, honey, you gave us your word of honor you'd go through with this. I know, Jerry, but I'm scared. Oh, dear, there's nothing to worry about. Yvonne! - Oui, Mademoiselle. - Venez ici. Pas besoin d'?tre aussi b?te! Cet h'homme ne comprend jamais rien. Calmez-vous. Brewster, what she's trying to tell you is the curly line doesn't work. There's evidently something wrong with the electricity. C'est ce que j'ai essay?e de lui dire depuis une demi-heure. Miss Margaret, that can't be. The inspector has been here three times during the past week... ...and has looked over everything most thoroughly. But, Brewster, there must be something wrong. I wish you'd try to fix it for me. - Certainly, Miss Margaret. - Idiot! Mademoiselle, cet homme est un v?ritable idiot. Il comprend jamais rien. Brewster ne comprend pas ce que vous dites anglais. Il est n?cessaire que vous parliez en fran?ais. Oh, c'est trop dificile. Oh, I know it's very difficult, Yvonne, because I'm always speaking French to you. Oui, mais Mademoiselle, je ne crois pas... From now on we'll speak nothing but English. - But Mademoiselle... - Now, what did I say? I speak English so bad. Well, it's the only way you'll learn. Now remember, no more French. Oh, oui, Mademoiselle, j'essayerai. I... I mean... I try. - That's better. My wrap, please, Yvonne. - Oui, Mademosielle. That's the girl she's going out with. Won't be long now. I wish it was all over. Oh, Mademoiselle, vous ?tes si jolie ce soir. Now say that in English. Mademoiselle look very pretty this night. No, no, not this night, tonight. - Tonight. - That's better. - Good night, Yvonne. - Bon soir, Mademoiselle. Say, Johnny, I wonder what's holding them up. Oh, gosh, if they don't come pretty soon, I'm just going to pass out. It's all right, dear, it won't be long. Miss Margaret, I feel it my duty to show you this. Well, what do you think of that? Hm, my! There have been a lot of hold-ups lately, haven't there? Yes, there have. Miss Margaret, if I may suggest, it would be wise to leave your jewels at home tonight. You know, this is right near where we're going, isn't it? Quite. Brewster, for once I think you're right. Thank you, Miss Margaret. Yvonne, will you help me with these, please? Oh, my, I wonder if those Paglers are going to be there tonight. I hope not. With all their money, I don't want them in our set. I beg your pardon, Miss Margaret. - Would you open the safe for me, please? - Surely, Brewster. Oh, Yvonne, will you unclasp this, please? Oui, madame. Thank you, miss. Oh, Brewster, will you take mine also? Yes, ma'am. You know, it's getting awfully late, don't you think we'd better hurry? Oh, yes, let's go, dear. Oh, Margaret, I forgot to tell you George is going to stop by... ...from the club with those books for you. - I thought you'd want Brewster to know. - Oh, surely. Brewster, you'll see that someone's up when Mr. Wells comes, won't you? - Certainly, miss. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. I'm so sorry that George wasn't able to come. There they go now. Now brace up. There's nothing to be frightened of. Alright, Jerry. Oh, Brewster. What's the matter? See. Mademoiselle is again most careless, she forget this. What I do? We can't put it in the safe without her. You'd better put it in that center drawer and lock it up. Oui. She's in. Come on, Nick, we'll get up on that balcony. Hello. No. This is not the maternity hospital. Alright, I'll keep my eye out for you. Good evening, Casey. What's on your mind? Say, Brewster, I saw a couple of men on the roof. They may be trying to break in. So I think I'll take a look around. If it's by the roof they're coming in, it's upstairs they'll be first. So I think I'll go up there. It'll only take a minute. Well, where are the lights? There's a lot of second-story work going on lately. And you can't be too careful. Where does that lead to? That leads to the balcony, but... I don't remember drawing those curtains. - You don't, eh? - Why, no, I... I was up here a few moments ago and... everything... Hello, that's funny. I could swear that I drew that picture down. It's still locked. Are you sure you didn't leave that up? I'm positive. That's funny. - What's that? - I don't know. - Where'd that come from? - From that room. Well, I'm going to find out. - There she is. - Where? - What's she doing in there? - I don't know. - Miss Margaret. - Oh, yes... Brewster? You're surprised to see me, aren't you, Brewster? Why, yes, Miss Margaret, I... You didn't expect me back so soon did you? - No, miss, what happened? - Well, I, um... - Would you mind, please... - Oh, Casey, do be careful. Yes, certainly, I'm sorry, Miss Waring. Brewster, what is it, what does the officer want? Why, miss, Casey said that he saw two men on the roof. I thought they were burglars trying to break in. Burglars, how thrilling. Did you find them? No, but I'm not done looking for them yet. Come on, Brewster, let's go out on the balcony. They're going to the other room. See, it's as solid as a rock. And no one has a key but myself. Miss Waring is kind of careless and won't trust herself with one. Oh... Oh, no, indeed. I shouldn't be trusted with keys even for a moment. You know, Miss Waring, people that own safes do the funniest things. I knew a woman once who wrote the combination of the safe... ...on the wall right beneath the safe. Oh, Miss Waring, I think I'll take a look around on the balcony. Oh.. I don't think I'd bother. Oh, just to make sure. - Brewster, unlock that gate. - Very well, Casey. Oh, Miss Margaret, it's quite chilly here. I'm afraid you'll catch cold. Oh, well... Well, very well, Brewster. Brewster, qu'est-ce qui se passe? Il n' y a rien arriv?, qu'est-ce qu'il y a? Oh, mademoiselle, d?j? de retour? Oh, mademoiselle, qu'est-ce qu'il y a? Pourquoi ?tes vous d?j? rentr?e, vous n'?tes pas malade? Il n'est pas arriv? un accident? Oh, madamoiselle, porquoi vous ne me r?pondez pas? Hm? Oh, I know now why you not speak with me. - Oh, do you? - Yes. Well, that's good. You know, tonight when you say you not speak with me in French again, I didn't think you mean it. Oh, yes, I meant every word of it. From now on, let's speak English. Yes, mademoiselle. But why are you back so soon, mademoiselle? Well, Casey, did you find anything? Narry a thing. I told you it would be all right. Officer, did you find anything? Not a thing. And I have to beg your pardon for busting in on you. Don't apologize, it's a pleasure to know that you're taking such good care of us. Oh, my dear. But, um... of course I wouldn't care to have you burst in again tonight. Don't worry, I'll not be making a fool of myself twice in the same evening. - Good night, Miss Waring. - Good night. Come on, Brewster, I want to tell you a funny story. Did you ever hear the story of the Irishman that worked on a boat... - ...and thought the anchor was a pick? - No. He stood there a half a day looking at the anchor and the mate says to him: "What are you standing there for?" He says, "I'm waiting to see the man that can lift that pick." - Mademoiselle. - Yes. The officer, what he want? Oh, he thought there were burglars in the house. - Burglars? - Oh, yes, but of course there aren't. That is good, because they would have get plenty tonight. Yes? What do you mean? Has Mademoiselle forgotten? Madame Wells leave her jewel in her bag in the safe? Oh, I... Yes, I had forgotten. And just a moment. This, Mademoiselle is most careless. - Where did you get this? - She forget it in the bedroom. Some day her jewels will be stolen. It wouldn't surprise me a bit. Um... Here, put it in the safe. Oui, Mademoiselle. - What are you waiting for? - The safe is locked. Oh... well, open it. Oh, but Mademoiselle know I haven't the combination. And Brewster have the key of the inside door. Oh, yes, of course, how silly of me. You know, Yvonne, it would save me a lot of trouble if you knew the combination to that safe. Yes, Mademoiselle, but it is too great a responsibilit? to a servant. - Yes. - Will you open it? Well, I... Really, it wouldn't do us any good without Brewster's key. No. I'll take this. I'll attend to it later myself. You go to bed. You look so tired. Oh, but, Mademoiselle, I cannot sleep, you know I have insomnia. Oh... oh, yes, that's right. Isn't there something in the house that would put you to sleep? Oh, only the tablet that the doctor ordered for you. That's fine, you go and get those tablets. I want you to have a nice, sound sleep. Oh, thank you, Mademoiselle, I'll enjoy it. Hey, Brewster, did you hear the one about the Scotsman... ...who invited one of the Siamese twins out to a theater and a dinner... ...if she could get away from her sister? - Good evening, Brewster. - Good evening, Mr. Wells. - Is there anything wrong? - Oh, no, sir. The officer thought he saw someone on the roof. - Just a false alarm, sir. - Oh, I see. Well, it's a good thing Miss Waring is not at home or she would be frightened. But Miss Margaret is at home, sir. - She's home, so early? - Yes, sir. Well, that's fine. I'll just drop in and say hello. - Please. Thank you. - Thank you. - I hope it make me sleep. - Ah, yes, I do too. - Good night, Yvonne. - Bonne nuit, mademoiselle. Wait. If you do happen to wake up, just take another one. Oh, thank you, Mademoiselle. - Oh, boin soir, Monsieur Wells. - Bon soir, Yvonne. - Is Miss Margaret still up? - Yes, I was just with her. I think you can still go in. Good evening, Margaret. - May I come in? - Well... you are in, aren't you? - Yes. - Well then, come in. Thank you. Brewster's been telling me that you've had quite a scare here tonight. Oh, yes, I certainly have. In fact, I'm still having one. Well, for crying out loud. First a flatfoot, then the maid, and now the boyfriend. Shh! I never expected to find you in. I thought you and Mother were over on Long Island. Well, we were, but, um... Well, you see, we came back. Yes, I see. What happened? - Oh, well, it was... the same old trouble. Mother's nerves again, I'll bet. That's it, hm-hm. Poor darling. I'll just give her a ring. I wouldn't, she may be just falling asleep. Yes, I guess you're right, Margaret. I'll drop in on her in the morning. Oh, by the way, I brought the books over I told you about. Here they are, Margaret. I hope you like them. Oh, yes, I'm sure I will. Oh... what's the matter? - Oh, it's back. - What? - My neuralgia. - Maybe we'd better go home. - Oh, no, don't do that. - Oh, yes, we'd better. - Oh, no, please don't! - Grover, Mrs. Wells feels too ill to go on. Turn back. Yes, Miss Margaret. Oh, why did you do that? There's no sense in going any place when you don't feel well. Oh, dear! You know, Margaret? I think burglars agree with you. Why, I've never seen you look so charming. Thank you. You know it's a pity you and I couldn't fall in love with each other. It would have pleased the old governor. Oh... do you think so? Yes, I'm sure of it. He was a grand old gentleman. Yes, he has a wonderful face. You know, one could almost tell by looking at him... ...that he never did a wrong deed in his life. - No. - No wonder they made him governor. Made him governor? Why... yes, didn't you know? No. Oh, I see. It must have been in the islands. - Oh, yes, that's it, in the islands. - Yes. You know, Margaret, somehow or other you seem changed tonight. Changed? Why... why... it's just your imagination. I'm just the same. The same hair, and the same eyes, and... the same hands, and... the same complexion and everything, it's... Well... My ring! Where is it? - Why, I... I took it off. - You did? Well, do you remember what you said? Why... yes, of course. Do you? Yes. What are you doing, don't be an idiot. Listen, are you going to let that guy get fresh with Mary? Put that away, you're crazy! Please, you shouldn't have done that, I... I shouldn't have let you. You must go now. Please, Margaret, just let me stay a little longer. Now that I've found the real you. No, I... I'm afraid if you do, the Margaret you knew might come back. Hardly. I've forgotten about her completely. And the real me that you've just discovered... will you forget her too? I'll never forget her as long as I live. Please, Margaret. Get the ring and let me put it on again with a new meaning. Oh, no... not tonight. Tomorrow perhaps. Well, I'm going right home now and wake up Mother and tell her. - She'll be tickled pink. - Oh, no, don't wake her. Promise me? Very well, I'll promise. - We'll both tell her tomorrow? - Hm-hmm. I'll see you tomorrow early? - Good night. - Good night. - Gee, I thought his nibs would never go. - Hurry up, Mary. This roof's as cold as a stepmother's kiss. There. Gee, boys, I don't think we ought to... No, no, none of that, let's go to work. Turn off those lights. Come on, Nick. - Did you get the combination? - No. Nobody's got it but that Waring girl. Well, it ain't no use trying to hit them numbers. Let me at it, come on. - Where's Brewster, asleep? - Yes, I guess so. And the maid? Oh, she won't wake up until morning, and maybe not then. Fine. Then we haven't a thing to worry about. - Good night, Mrs. Wells. - Good night. Alright. Hurry up, boys, will you, I'm getting nervous. Don't worry, Mary, we'll be through in no time. What are you doing here? - Nick, don't shoot! - Hold on! What did you go and do that for? - I don't know. - We've got to go, quick. Come on. Oh... you poor kid. Miss Margaret, what's the matter? I heard a shot. - Get a doctor, Brewster, quick. - But who's that? - Never mind, get a doctor. - Yes. Hello! Hello! Um... give me, um... Murray Hill 4842! Come over, doctor... No, no, Miss Waring's all right. It's somebody else. Good bye. It's all right, miss, he's coming right away. - Is there anything I can get you? - Get some water and a towel quick. Yes, miss, yes. Hey, Brewster, I just heard a shot. Was it in here? Yes, yes, I know. It's upstairs and somebody's been hurt. - Who is it? - I don't know, I don't know. - Casey, phone headquarters! - Well, where's the phone? - There! - Oh. Morningside, 3100. And be quick about it. Hello? Who is it? Oh, O'Toole. This is Casey. Say, there's been a shooting at the Waring home. A lady has been shot. Send a couple of men around, will you, right away. - Mary! - Oh, Jerry, why did you come back? What are you staying here for? Well, I... I can't leave. She's hurt. Yeah, I'll stay here till they get here, sure. No, no, I don't know a thing about it. Oh, all right. - Say, where is it? - In that room. - Come on! - Yes. - Jerry, somebody's coming, beat it! - I can't go without you... That's the girl that was hurt. They must have gone out there. Take care of her, Brewster. - Brewster, turn on the lights. - Yes. We've got to get her off the floor. We'll put her... put her over there. Why... Miss Margaret, she looks exactly like you. - Oh, yes, it's extraordinary, isn't it? - Most! Brewster, get the water and the towel. Yes. It's most extraordinary. Oh, Brewster, will that doctor ever get here? Oh, yes, miss, he said he was coming right away. He won't be long now. - Oh, I do hope he'll hurry. - He'll be here very soon, miss. Doctor, you're sure she won't die, aren't you? She won't die, Miss Waring. There's not the slightest danger of it. But when she wakes up, she'll have a terrific headache. Please, Miss Margaret, don't worry. Inspector, they didn't get into the safe and nothing was stolen. So why don't we let the whole matter drop? I'm sorry, Miss Waring, but the Police Department doesn't work that way. You know, this likeness is the funniest thing I ever ran up against. I can't tell the difference between you and this little crook. It is extraordinary, isn't it, Inspector? Oh, Miss Waring. Please. Would you mind telling me again exactly what happened here tonight? Why, certainly, Inspector. I was in my bedroom and I heard a noise out here. I opened the door and I saw two men and this young woman standing in front of the safe. One of the men raised his gun and... ...and just as he fired the girl screamed and threw herself in front of me. The bullet hit her and... and she collapsed. The men went out through that window and then... ...and then Brewster came in. Aside from the resemblance, I can't see why they should shoot at their confederate. And why should she throw herself in front of you? Why, I... I'm sure I don't know. From the time that Officer Casey left until you heard the shot, you say that no one came into or went out of this house? - Mr. Wells came in. - Wells? Who is he? He's Miss Margaret's fianc?. Well, get him on the phone, I want to see him. I've already telephoned him, sir. Oh, Brewster, you haven't called Mr. Wells. Why, yes, Miss Margaret. - He and his mother are on their way now. - A very good idea, Brewster. I want to see everyone who was here tonight. But it's ridiculous to ask Mrs. Wells to come out this hour of the night. Brewster, telephone them and ask them not to come. Yes, Miss Margaret. You're taking your orders from me, Brewster. I'm in charge here. Well, Doc, how long do you figure it will be before she comes to? Probably a day or two. Possibly longer. Not soon enough to be of any help to me. It gives these crooks to much chance to get away. It's this confounded resemblance that's got me going. Yes, it is a coincidence, isn't it? Coincidence me eye. It's the key to the whole works. - Oh, yes? - Yes! - Can't you see that under the circumstances... - Inspector. What is it, Casey? - I was up in the maid's room. - Yeah? And I can't get her up. She's sleeping her head off. Oh... maybe she's been doped. Maybe. Hey, Doc, run up and give this maid the once over, will you? Casey will show you the way. Certainly. Oh, Doctor, do you... do you think it's safe to leave her? Perfectly safe, Miss Waring. You know, Doc, I shook that woman till her teeth rattled. Brewster, you've been with this family for twenty years. Can't you tell which is Miss Waring? Why, of course, that is Miss Waring. Would you swear to it? Can you prove it? Do you know of any birthmarks? I beg your pardon, Inspector. I'm only the butler. And if there are any birthmarks, I've not been privileged to see them. - Don't let anybody in or out, Farley. - Very well, sir. The poor young thing. You know, she's so very like you... ...that I can't think harshly of her. No, I can't either, Brewster. You know, I've never felt quite the same towards anyone before in my life. I fell so... so drawn towards her. It's hard to believe that she came in here to steal. Why, Miss Margaret, her face is just as honest as yours. Oh, yes... you're right, Brewster. How long have you known these Wellses? - Why, um... why, um... - For ten years, Inspector. Miss Margaret and Mr. George used to go to school together. Yes, Inspector, ten years. Would you mind sitting over here, Miss Waring? Why... certainly. I'm going to try a little experiment. - All right, Casey, send them in. - Yes, sir. Go on in. Well! Margaret, my dear, my dear! We came just as soon as we could, Margaret. - What happened? - Why, uh... uh... There. Oh... is she dead? She's all right. Would you mind answering a few questions? Don't point. You make me so nervous. Why, it must have happened very quickly. It seems no time since I left here. Do you recall the exact time, Mr. Wells? Yes, I think so. It must have been about 12 o'clock. - Wasn't it, Margaret? - Why... yes, I think so. - Twelve o'clock when you met Margaret here? - Yes, Mother. Well, that just shows what a bad memory I have for time. Why, Margaret, I thought it was long after twelve when we came home. Why, I'm sure you must be mistaken. Possibly. Inspector, is the question of time of such great importance? Yes, in this case it is of the greatest importance. You were here earlier in the evening? Yes. I called on Margaret. We were to go to a ball on Long Island. Why did you return unexpectedly? - Because I was ill. - I wasn't speaking to you. Inspector, I don't like your attitude. What do you care who answers so long as you get the truth. Why, certainly. What... what difference could it make? - It makes a lot of difference. - Inspector. - Well? - The woman is undoubtedly drugged. - Drugged? - She probably won't come out of it... ...for the next 24 hours. How long have you known Miss Waring? Oh, I've known her for ten years, ever since she... You couldn't be mistaken in her identity? Oh, my dear man, don't be absurd! - And you? - Just what are you driving at, Inspector? Then you are both willing to swear that this is Margaret Waring? - Of course we are. - Certainly. Then who is... ...this? The resemblance is remarkable! Mar... Mar... Why, they're so much alike, I... I can't tell them apart. - Oh... oh, I know I am going to faint. - Oh, Mother! Doctor, will you please help me into the next room? - Certainly. - Ah, brace up there. You know, Mother's extremely nervous, Doctor. Yes, I see she is. An experience like this is quite upsetting to her. There, Mother. The excitement is a little bit too much for her. She was lying right here, sir. And Miss Waring was kneeling beside her. - Is Mrs. Wells better? - Yes, she's quite all right now. Miss Waring, I'd like to have a quiet word with headquarters. - Where will I find a phone? - Why, um... You'll find one in the lower hall. You know, after all this excitement, ...I must stop and think before I answer the simplest questions. I've noticed that. You stay here. I've a feeling that Miss Waring should not be left alone. - Certainly. - I'll be back in a minute. Go ahead, Brewster. Casey, I want to talk to you. Right, Inspector. - Farley, close this door. - Yes, sir. Why, you're trembling, dear. Now, there's nothing to be afraid of. Everything is going to be all right. Come, sit down over here. Try and not let it upset you, dear. Now, sit right there and relax. Is that better? Do you know, Margaret, that yesterday... ...I might have been fooled. But not after tonight. Are you quite sure you could tell us apart? Yes, I could tell by the touch of your hand, dear. Even if the world was dark as Egypt. And yet it's really remarkable. She has your mouth... your chin... And the same pretty hands too. Why! You're not Margaret Waring. Who are you? Oh, never mind who I am. Are you going to give me away? - ... Farley. - Very well, sir. Well, we're getting on. I've located a man who saw you and Mrs. Wells arrive here at half past twelve. What do you say to that? Why, I should say your man should have his watch repaired. Doesn't it strike you as a little strange, Miss Waring, that you should be here entertaining Mr. Wells from 11:30 to 12:00... whereas you were seen arriving with Mrs. Wells at half past twelve? Mr. Updike, if it weren't so ridiculous, I should say you were accusing me of trying to rob my own home. Well, Inspector, what have you found out? Mrs. Wells, when you were here earlier in the evening, did Miss Waring have on the same dress she has on now? - Why, Margaret... - I'm asking you, Mrs. Wells. She was wearing a wrap and I don't remember. This case has resolved itself into a question of identity. Which of these two young women is the real Margaret Waring? Oh, the man's insane. Mrs. Wells, as a lifelong friend of the family, don't you know of some mark of identification? which would prove which of these two young women is the real Margaret Waring? Oh, let me see. Oh, there's a little ring that she never takes off her finger. Show it to him, Margaret. Let me see your hands. - Is that the ring? - No. - Where is the ring. - I... I beg your pardon, Inspector. But I have the ring. - Is this the ring? - Yes. Now, I took this ring off the real Miss Waring's finger tonight. Is this young women the one who entertained you here earlier in the evening? Why, of course she is. The safe... the safe! Her subconscious mind is still fixed on the last impression... ...she received before she was shot. Doesn't that prove... It proves nothing. The thought of the safe would be uppermost in the minds of both of them. I have it, Inspector. The combination. Miss Margaret is the only person who knows it. Let her open the safe, that will convince you. For once in your life, Brewster, you've made a sensible suggestion. It's all right, they haven't damaged it any. Well, let's have the combination. Now, look here, Inspector. You have no right to ask such proof. And as Miss Waring's fianc?, I refuse to permit her to submit to such a ridiculous procedure. Mr. Wells, I am in charge here. All right, young lady, I'm waiting. To the right, three times to 75. To the right, three times to 75. Once, twice... All right. To the left, twice to 100. To the left, twice to 100. All right. Back to 38. Back to 38. Well, I hope you're satisfied, Inspector. Just a minute. How do you open this inside door? Brewster, give him the key. Would you mind telling me what's in this bag? - Inspector, that... - I wasn't speaking to you. - Why... I don't know. - You don't know? The bag doesn't belong to me. It's Mrs. Wells'. That's what I've been trying to tell you. Kindly give me my bag. Miss Waring, I owe you a most humble apology. Oh, that's all right, Mr. Updike. You're only doing your duty. - Thank you, Miss Waring. - Well, I do hope you're satisfied now. I am indeed, madame. - Well, good night all. - Good night, Inspector. - Good night! - Come on, Farley, let's beat it. - Good morning, Miss Wallace. - Good morning. You know, you've been awfully good to this young woman, Miss Waring. Letting her have your bed and taking such good care of her. - Oh... well, um... how is she? - She's fine. She's been stirring and I think she'll come to shortly. Well, you... you'll be sure and let me know just as soon as she does, won't you? Yes, I will. Come in. - Good morning. - Good morning. I'm glad you're still here. You know, I was afraid you might have gone. Oh, I couldn't go and leave her like that. How is Margaret this morning? Oh, she's improving. We expect her to regain consciousness any minute. Well, that's good. Will you come and sit down a minute, please? Surely. How did you know the combination of that safe? Why, I... I read it from her mind. - From her mind? - Hm-hmm. - Can you do that? - Yes. Well... that's funny. Margaret can to. - Good morning, officer. - Good morning. - Nice day, isn't it? - Certainly is. I don't know that I can ever remember more beautiful weather at this time of the year. Me neither. - Is Miss Waring home? - Yes, sir. I'm sorry and ashamed that last night... I tricked you into giving me just for a little while... ...the love that really belonged to her. But it doesn't belong to her. You see, Margaret and I are just great pals. As a matter of fact, she told me that some day I would meet a girl that would show me the difference. And now I have met her. Oh, but you... You don't know anything about me... Except what's bad. I know that you've never had a break. And that you want to be all that is good. I beg your pardon, Miss Margaret. A gentleman to see you. Brewster, where is he? He's in the lower hall, miss. - Well... I'll see him. - Yes, Miss Margaret. - Is there anything wrong? - No. I... I can't tell you who this person is. But I must see him alone. Why, of course. If you should need me, I'll be down in the hall. Thank you. - Pardon me. - It's quite all right. Good morning, Miss Waring. Good morning, Mr. Jones. Marvelous, um... Marvelous weather we're having. Yes, I don't ever remember having seen lovelier weather this time of the year. - Oh, Jerry. - Then it is you, Mary. For a moment I thought you were the other girl. What are you doing here? - I came to get you. - Oh, don't be silly. Don't you know every cop in town is looking for you and Nick? Yes. And where do you think it's the last place they'd look? Right here. - Where is Nick? - I don't know. We got separated and he didn't show up at Lola's. - How's the Waring, girl, is she... - Oh, she's all right. I haven't time to tell you everything now. But you've got to get out of here. Sure, we've both got to get out of here. That's what I came back for. I knew you could fool them for a while, but your luck won't last forever. Come on, Mary, this is where you make your getaway. I beg your pardon, Miss Margaret. Mr. Updike is here. - Mr. Updike from headquarters? - Yes. Brewster, ask him to wait downstairs. I'll be down in a moment. Not on my account. Send him up. Send him up? That's his specialty, sending people up. I should be charmed to meet the inspector at such close quarters. Please see him here. - Send him up. - Yes, sir. Jerry, you just love to sit on the edge of a volcano, don't you? I'm willing to bet that when I go, he'll say good bye, wish me a pleasant journey and... and urge me to take you with me. Jerry, you've been out in the sun again... bareheaded. Good morning, Miss Waring. Oh, um... good morning, Inpsector. Oh, I'm sorry. Mr. Updike, this is Mr. Jones. - How do you do, Mr. Jones? - I'm glad to meet you, Inspector. I've met several men in your profession. - In England, of course. - Oh, yeah? Well, Miss Waring, our young friend in there is Mary Brennan. She works with two crooks. A guy called Nick... ...and another known as Jerry "The Gent". An English crook, by the way. He's been in this country for quite some time. Really? What a picturesque name. Jerry "The Gent". - Delightful. - Yes, indeed. This is a very interesting situation that we have here, Mr., um... - Jones. - Oh, yes, Jones. This Mary Brennan and Miss Waring's maid, ...are both unconscious. A word from either one of them would clear up the whole matter. We expect to get it in about an hour. Did you hear that, dear? Within an hour. The inspector will know the whole truth of this matter. There's a telephotoed picture of this Jerry "The Gent" on the way over here to me now. Well, isn't that interesting. I should like to see it. You know, Inspector, we live in a wonderful scientific age. We certainly do. Oh, by the way, Miss Waring, You said that you could identify both these men that broke in here last night. I'll never forget them as long as I live. Good. All right, Dugan, bring him in. - Come on here. - Oh, listen, what's... Shut up! - Did you get anything out of him? - No, Inspector, not a word. You didn't, eh? Miss Waring, take a look at this man. Is this one of them? Why, no... they were both much taller than he. You're sure you never saw him before. No, never. Mr. Jones, this is a typical underworld character. Really? You don't say. Yes, I do say. - You do? - Yes. All right, Dugan, take him downtown. Tell them to hold him a couple of days. All right, Inspector. Come on there. My word, it's later than I thought it was. I must be getting along. Look here, dear, you look... you look pale and tired. Why don't you come with me for a little drive in the park? Yes, that's a good idea. A little fresh air will do you good. No, thank you, I think I'll stay here. Are you sure you won't come? Quite sure. Well, good bye, dear. Good bye. Well, Mr. Jones, I'm very glad to have met you. Thanks, Inspector. - Good morning, Brewster. - Good morning, Casey. I have a picture here for the inspector. Where is he? He's upstairs, shall I take it up? No, you shall not. I'll take it up meself. Very well, Casey. Good bye, Inspector, I don't suppose I shall be seeing you again. - Are you going away? - Yes, I'm going for a little trip. - For my health. - Well, pleasant journey. Thanks. - So long. - Good bye. - Good bye, dear. - Good bye. Inspector, here's the picture you sent for. Good. Let's have it, Casey. Well, cheerio, Inspector. No, just a minute. This is the picture you wanted to see. Another time perhaps, I've very little time now. No, but you ought to see this, it's very interesting. Well, of all the dumbbells. Take a look at that. Look at that, dear. Charming-looking fellow, isn't he? Why, yes, he certainly is. I sent for a picture of Jerry "The Gent" and they send me Jerry "The Greek". - Now, isn't that annoying? - It certainly is. Now tell me, Inspector, is this another typical underworld character? - Oh, yes indeed. - Really, that's very interesting. Thanks. Well, I'll drop you a line, dear. - Good bye, Inspector. - Good bye, Mr. Jones. Charming gentleman, that Mr. Jones. Well, if you'll excuse me, I've got a little balling out to do. Come on, Casey. Have you, um... - Have you a match, Lieutenant? - Why, sure! Thanks. -Another example of police efficiency. - Thank you. Well, it's a great day to be out in the fresh air. It sure is. - I beg your pardon. - I beg your... Well, if it ain't my old friend Jerry "The Gent". I'm afraid you're making a mistake. Wait a minute. Where do you think you're going? - What's the matter, Grey? - Inspector, - Casey brought you the wrong envelope. - Yeah, I know he did. Here's the right one. Thanks. Well, I'll be... Take a look at that. I've seen it. Well, Inspector, it looks as though I'll have to postpone my trip. No, you'll take your trip all right! But it won't cost you anything. All right, Casey. Come on, O'Brien. Well, au revoir, Inspector. Yeah, over the river, Jerry. Oh, hello, George. Good morning, Margaret. How are you feeling? Oh, I don't know, I have sort of a... Why... who are you? I, um... I... Where did you get that? I... I've always had it. That's funny. I have one just like it. I wonder if it's the same as mine inside. Open it. Open it? I didn't know it opened. Oh, yes, let me show you. Oh, it's just like mine. Look. Mary and Margaret Waring. Then... then we must be sisters. Yes. Didn't you know you had a sister? No. Well, I didn't either until about a year ago when Father died. He left me a sealed envelope telling me about you... ...and instructing me not to say anything about it to anyone until I found you. You see, when he and Mother separated, Mother took you and Father took me. There was some kind of a scandal, but... Oh, we don't care about that now, do we? Now tell me, what is this all about? Well, you see, last night I came in here to rob you. But you came home too soon and then... And then you were shot. Do you remember? Oh, yes... I do remember now. Oh, but I didn't steal anything. Honestly, I didn't steal anything and then... Now, please, dear, don't get excited. George, did I hear you say "dear"? Well, yes, you did, Margaret. Well! Do you remember what you said about that electric something? Hm-hmm. You were right. Tell me, George, have you asked your mother yet? No, I haven't, Margaret. And furthermore, I'm not going to. - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
