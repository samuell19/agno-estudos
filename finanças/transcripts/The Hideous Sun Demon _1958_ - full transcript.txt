Immediately after the launching of US satellites, number one and number three into outer space, newspaper headlines across the country told the world of a new radiation hazard from the sun. Far more deadly than cosmic rays. An obscure scientist, iconic Dr. Gilbert McKenna had already already discovered this danger from the sun. This is his story. They're bringing him in now. The radiation patient? Yes. Oh, I don't know if I like that. Guys, it's a bad one. This guy's been soaked with radiation. I better call Dr. Stern. He's been out since we picked him up. Page Dr. Stern please for admitting room. Emergency. Let's get back away, Bob. Yeah. Did you get his name? Yeah, it's Dr. Gilbert McKenna. Dr. Buckell, I'm sorry I kept you waiting. It's alright Doctor, you're a busy man. Ms. Lansing, this is Dr. Stern. How do you do, Doctor? You work with McKenna too, Ms. Lansing? Yes. Yes, we're on our Dockstar project together. Ms. Lansing is Dr. McKenna's laboratory assistant. Is he going to be alright, Doctor? I'm afraid that's too soon to say definitely, Ms. Lansing. He seems to be improving although.. Although what? Ms. Lansing, I ask you and Dr. Buckell to come here because there are some very puzzling facts that's in this case. What do you mean? Before we go in to that, I would like to know exactly what happened that day. Sit down, please. We're doing some work on newly developed radioactive isotopes. We use all the usual precautions. Lead screens, remote control handling device, you what I mean. All radioactive material is kept in a lead vault. When we want a particular isotope, we have a little electric trailer. I toy train. Like you give to kids to Christmas if we back it into the vault. And we load on the isotope by means of a remote controlled arms and run the train out of the vault again. I see. But his morning, something happened. Dr. McKenna had just ran the train out of the vault and, and, you were there are you? Tell him. Well, the train always stops behind the large lead screen before we unload it. Gil, Dr. McKenna had gone behind the screen to take the container off the train and, well, it must've fallen to the floor. I was on the other side of the room and I heard a noise and he called out to me, there've been an accident. Well, when those things happen, whenever under any circumstances deviate from regular procedure, there's an alarm button in the room that alerts the whole building into an emergency station. Ms. Lansing sound the alarm and then left the room. That's also part of the procedure. Were you expose to the radiation? No, I was on the other side of the screen. The odd part is that when the emergency crew went in to investigate, they found Dr. McKenna unconscious. Now, generally speaking, over-exposure to radiation doesn't cause loss of consciousness. How long was he exposed? Oh, five or six minutes. In takes the emergency crew that long to put on their radiation suits before they went in. He was exposed all this time? Yes. I just don't understand it. What don't you understand? Dr. Buckell, you've told me that Dr. McKenna was exposed to highly radioactive material for five or six minutes. Yet, after he recovered after the initial shock, he showed absolutely no residual effects, whatever. No burns, no radiation effects, nothing. That is unusual. Then he's alright. Well, we hope so. I hope so but you said he showed no reaction. So far, he hasn't. It seems inconceivable had he could be exposed for that length of time without any effect. Well, we can only wait and see. Please excuse me. And may I suggest you check with me in a day or so. I feel we should keep him in general observation for a few days. Thank you very much, Doctor. Very kind. Yes, thank you so much. You let us know if any.. By all means. I will be watching him very closely. Goodbye. Bye, Doctor. What effect does he expect, Dr. Buckell? He doesn't know. That nobody does. It's a new isotope that never existed in nature before. What's its effect will be is anybody's guess. And if Gil would only listen when.. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. But it's not Gil's fault. That's alright, like this morning in. He just had a headache. You mean a hangover. The equipment must have been in fault. Gil's always careful when he handles isotopes. Careful? How can anybody be careful with a hangover. He didn't have a hangover, I was with him all morning. He had a headache! You see Gil as rose-colored lad. I've known him since his first year science major. That I was the one who recommended him to this project. And I warned him for the last time. Whiskey and soda mix, not whiskey and science. We better discuss this some other time. Alright, we discuss it when Gil's done with this. Come on, I'll take you home. How are you feeling Dr. McKenna? As well since just a moment ago, I felt strong enough to shake down the very walls of this hospital but as soon you entered the room, your beauty so overwhelmed me that I feel as weak as a day-old kitten. So you forgot this? Oh, I asked you a serious question. I like a serious answer. Alright, I feel very well, thank you. But I am getting a little tired of being treated like a specimen under a microscope of all the hospital staff standing around waiting for me to develop some new symptom. You'll be able to be go home in a couple of days. Good. Right now, we're going to take you out for an air. Oh, good. Up to the solarium roof where you get plenty of sun. Well, let's go. Oh, not so fast. Would like in a wheelchair. A wheelchair? That's right, as doctor's ordered. I'll be back in a minute. I'll be back for you at about 45 minutes. Alright. Pardon me, Young Man. Is that perchance a magazine on the table called sickness and health? Uh, let's see. I hope you won't think me rude if I don't talk to you for a while. I'm anxious to get at my article. Here it is. Young Man, I hate to bother you again but... Ah, your face! Somebody! No, it can't be! Dr. McKenna? What's wrong? I thought... I must know what happened to Gil. Nothing of it makes any sense. Ms. Lansing, Dr. McKenna has fallen victim to one of the strangest and most baffling medical phenomena I've ever seen, or even heard of. Let me try to explain what I mean. These are basic classes of beings in the animal kingdom. From the little one cell gamete up here in the corner through the intermediate classes and right down to man. As you know, all life on earth began with a one cell animals. And biologist estimate that it took several million years to evolve a evolve a form as complex as the mammals, as man. But here's something very interesting. During the nine-month period of conception to birth, the human being goes through the same evolutionary process in the womb. In other words, it first begins as a one-celled animal. Then it becomes a collection of cells. It start to assume a definite form as the cells begin to take on specialized functions. He next passes through a state when he is similar in structure to a fish. And then from an amphibian, to a reptile. Finally it passes into the mammal state where he begins to take on more and more the appearance of a human being. Now, we know that each individual goes through this evolutionary process before he's born. And it's not inconceivable that process could be reversed. Reversed? It's possible. You mean a human being could evolve backwards to time and become some sort of prehistoric creature? That's fantastic. So, Doctor, are the isotopes you're developing in your atomic laboratory is. I wanna show you some slides which may help you to understand what's happened to Dr. McKenna. Well, Dr. Buckell, could you get that blind for me, please. Recently some biochemists conducted a series of experiment on insects to see what effects certain forms of radiation have on living cells. I want to show you a red ant which have been exposed to intense amounts of X-ray. This is a common housefly after exposure to gamma rays. This one used to be a grasshopper. Well, I guess you get the idea. Well, Dr. Buckell, could you get that blind for me, please. Not very good, I'm afraid. The radiation from that isotope caused the peculiar and subtle change in the cells of Dr. McKenna's body. Just as other radiation had done to the cells in the bodies of those insect. His whole appearance has changed into something scaly, almost lizard-like. But Doctor, there was no intervening like this at first. No, a catalyst was needed to complete the reaction. The catalyst is sunlight. Sunlight? That's what happened the other afternoon. He was sitting in the sun when gradually, the cells in his body reacted and you know the rest. We were able to get him over that first attack simply by putting him in a dark room. Then he's alright now? As long he stays out of the sun. What about artificial light? No trouble with that. The radiation spectrum of tungsten is quite different from that of sunlight. Doctor, how's he taking it? Psychologically, I'm mean. Not too well. He's retreated entirely into himself. It's difficult even to talk to him. He resigned from the project. I gotta let him, probably. He wanted to go off some place by himself. Is he able to leave? I mean is he well enough physically? Physically, yes. Expect for this terrible sensitivity to sunlight. However, this goes beyond the physical. Dr. Stern, you don't mean that something's happened to his mind. A terrible thing has happened to him Ms. Lansing. Somehow, he must learn to live with it. To do that, he'll need help. If he goes off by himself where he'll have neither friends nor a medical care, well, there's no telling what could happen. Can't you keep him here? Not against his will. Clear her up, please. No, thanks. Alright. Say, how come the dark glasses at night? I've been in the hospital. That's too bad. Hey, where can I get some cigarettes.

When will he be here? Day after tomorrow. Have you heard from Gil? No, our telephone's disconnected. We'll let's dive out and see him. Do you think I should? I think you're going to. Anyway, good news like this should be delivered personally. You're right. I'll drive out in the morning too see him. Darwin never even scratched the surface. How could he?

At this time of the day? Why not? Why not what? George. I said I'd let you know about tonight. You tell me about it now, Trudy. George, this is Gil. Yeah. Well, are you ready? Well, I haven't finished my drink just yet. Okay, finish it. Hey, while as you are killing time, why don't you sit down? No, thanks. If you don't mind, she's going with me. We'll isn't that I mind, it just that I'm not sure she wants to go with you. Oh, yeah? How about it, Trudy? George, I'm not ready to leave just yet. Why don't you sit down? Hey, hey that's good enough, isn't it? Not enough, Mister. I had a date to take Trudy home. And that's exactly what I'm gonna do. Not if she doesn't wanna go, you're not. Come on, Trudy. I said enough to her. I don't care what you said. Stop it! Gil! Gil! Gil. Please stop, Gil! Gil, Gil, please stop. Come on, let's get out of here. Come on. Hey, I not through with you, hey! So fun. Boy, that was quite a drive. Yeah, I like to drive fast. Kinda takes your mind off unpleasant things. It's good as an excuse as any, I guess. Want another drink. Don tell me you got a bottle of vodka in here. Better than that. Here. Oh, the comforts of home. Yup, if they ever so humble. Like you, see. I thought we were going off the cliff. Here. No, no. Lots of room. Besides, this will steady your nerves. Thanks. Here's to good health. May you always have it. You're a strange guy. I am? Yeah. I can't figure out just why. You know it's funny. Out of nowhere, you walked to a bar, bought me a drink, got into a fight, now that we're here. Yeah, where are we? You know where I am. Sitting out here in a car by the beach with a man I only met an hour ago. I think that's how to put it. You're sorry you came? No. I like you. You think I've come out here with you frightened? No, I guess not. We'll take a walk. Walk? Yeah, down by the water. It's a beautiful night. Alright. Well, I'll race you in the water. Wait I can't rid of these for you. Okay. How you doing? I'll be out in a minute. That blanket gonna work out alright? Well, you don't look too bad at all. It's a perfect fit. Oh, with this whole banket. What the matter? Are you kidding? I've got practically nothing on under this. It's treacherous. Take it off. Oh sure. I can see you going to force me to be gentleman and offer you my coat. But, first you better have some of this. Don't you think we've had enough. We've already fallen to the water once together. Sorry about what happened. Forget it. I think it's kind of fun. That is if I don't get to hold you. Don't worry, that thing can cure. Common cold itself is a medical condition. That among other things. Of course I could take you home. Don't be silly, I can't go home like this. We'll have to stay here until my clothes dry out. You're so right. I could use that coat now. Alright, trade you. Coat for the blanket. Come on now. Put it around my shoulders. Alright. Gil? Gil! Gil? Gil? Oh, Gil. You shouldn't have come in. I had to. What are you doing down here? None, as a matter of fact. I've got some better news for you, Gil. You remember Dr. Jacob Hoffman? Hoffman? Yes, you remember him. He and your father went to school together. Dr. Buckell knows him too. So what? Well, Dr. Hoffman has been studying radiation poisoning for a long time. He's been able to cure a lot of people. After you left, Dr. Buckell wrote him about you. We got a little from him and he's coming to help you. Don't you realize what this means? He maybe able to cure you. It's no use, Anne. Gil! I'm beyond helping. This this I've got is different. For days, I've reading I can find. My case is different, it's not an any other poisoning! Get me alone here! You can't stay locked up here for the rest of your life. What else can I do? Dr. Hoffman has offered to come here and examine you. You won't even have to leave the house. He'll be here this afternoon. I'll be driving up to see him, please Gil. Won't do any good. Please Gil. You can't just give up. You got to at least see him. He's come all this distance. Well, leave him. Please, just let me alone. Let me alone, please. Don't you wanna get well and live normally again? I still now how it's been wondering about you, worrying and hoping. Please, Gil. If you don't care about yourself, please consider the people that do. Anne. Anne. I see. Oh, Gil. Thank you. You're not going to find out anything that way Dr. Hoffman, my heart's alright. Now Gil, you must know. Stop this playing games, aren't we? You're like this you know. You like to show off. It's all very well if you had to joke about it. It's not very funny to me. I thought you're going to help me. I hope to Gil. I wanna know here Gil is things are not as bad as you have feared. We analyzed the isotope we're working on, Gil. Dr. Hoffman thinks he maybe able to cure you. Yeah, I think there's definite hope. Do you really mean it? Boy, I wouldn't just leave you both in a thing like that. I can't tell you how much it would mean for me to get well, Dr. Hoffman. For weeks, I've been locked up in this mausoleum unable to go out anytime except at night. Afraid of the sun and it makes horrible attacks. I'll do anything, anything to get well. Anything? Yes, yes, anything. Alright then. After few days of preliminary observation here at the house, we shall take you to my hospital in Bejis. But how? I can go out in the sun, not even of a little while. Oh, we'll make arrangements. But, we invite you not to leave this house. Not under any circumstances. Not even at night? Not even a the night. After what happened last evening, there's too much risk. No doubt you are aware that the transformation came this time after much shorter exposure to the sun for the first time. Yes, I know. Now this is of course, the skin gets more sensitive as time goes on. If there should be a next time, you might find that it only takes only a very brief exposure to the sun to change you. You might also find that it takes much longer to change you back. So no more wandering at night, my boy. And no more drinking. We'll get to the hospital as soon as possible. ♪ With a burning fire ♪ ♪ On and on ♪ ♪ Goes the maddening chase ♪ ♪ Why the great suspense ♪ Not even much of a goodbye, just in his car and drove off. I've been out with some odd ones in my time but he sure takes the cake. He didn't bother to wake me up. How'd you finally back to town? I hitchhiked. And let me tell me you that was no fun either. I must've been standing there for nearly half an hour, watching car, every car go by. Most of them didn't even bother looking. I could've been standing there with my clothes off and he wouldn't even slow down. Finally I managed to break down an old guy in a truck. See what got in his mind. But after night I'm churred. I would stick with guys I know. Double bourbon, please. Remembered me, Honey? Believe me, Trudy, I. Come on and see you outside. Come on, man. Wait a minute, hey! Cut it out! Alright, hey! Stop! That's enough! You don't have to kill him. Look at his face. Oh, give me a hand. Where are you taking him? I'll take him to a hospital. That's what I'm going to do. A hospital? I can't leave him here. Guys, he done his job and we can't send him home. Come on, let's get out of here. Come on, help me! Okay, just hold on. You. Yes. Where am I? My place. It's your place? Don't worry, they're not here. We're alone. Here drink some of this. Thanks. How are you feeling. Oh, brother. No don't! Pull off the curtain. You let the sunlight out. So what? Oh, it's just sunlight, it's bad for my eyes. Sorry. Yeah, as a matter of fact, I've been going to Doctor for some treatment. Then make yourself at home. Relax. Thanks. I'll go home right after dark. It's just, well, you know, the doctor advised to stay out of the sun. Who's complaining? You can stay longer if you want. Thanks. It's alright, it's probably Lucy. She's always trying to borrow something. Better take it easy. You don't look so hot. I don't feel so hot. Hello Trudy. Just thought I'd drop around to see how you were, after the little excitement last night. See you were gonna take him a hospital, huh. He's been here all night. And what if he has? That's my business. And mine! Why you know you shouldn't. We should have finished you off last night. Alright, Mister, step outside. George, Honey, I what you're thinking but nothing happened here last night. I just decided to bring him home instead of the hospital. Nothing wrong with that. No, of course not, Trudy. Nothing wrong with that and a lot of other things you do. Look, I can explain.. Shut up. He can't go out in the daylight, George. His eyes.. Knock it off. You're making a big mistake here. Okay, let's go. Not that way. Out the back. I'll talk to you later. Hey, wait a minute. Let's go. Can't we talk this over? Move! Alright. I wonder if we should call the police. He's been out for so long. No, we must wait. It's all we can do. That must be Gil. No! I couldn't help myself, Dr. Buckell. It wasn't your fault, Gil. He forced you out with the girl. Nevertheless, I committed a murder. I murdered somebody! Doctor's right. What time is it? Dr. Gil, we can prove it's self defense. You don't seem to understand. No matter what we prove, it does none of the fact that I wanted to kill him. I've devoted my life for science. Do you see what's happened? What good is it done me? What chance have I got to fight? Why should I be the one? Can you answer me that? Why me? Why should I be the one picked up with it? Please tell me why! Doctor, I swear, it shouldn't have been me. Gil. Gil, it's alright. Did you hear what happened? Paranoia. It's alright. We will do for you anything. I'm not a psychiatrist but. But after these circumstances. Dr. Gil is a scientist. Yeah, good scientist even more than a genius. But there is a very fine line there and any little thing can push him over. I'll go, Anne. No, I can try better. Don't worry, we'll take care of it. Who is it? I'm a police officer, open up. What do you want? I'm looking for Dr. McKenna. Gil? Yes? Anne, please. Don't make it any more harder for me. No, please don't go. There's nothing anybody can do. Have you a warrant of his arrest? Gil? Gil! Well, I hope you're both satisfied. He made a nice clean break. Yeah. It's not what I would have wished him. And he ran over one of my men in the process. Jacobs, call the state police give 'em a full description. Right. And get an ambulance up here right away. He's a dangerous man. He's only dangerous because he is a sick man. Yeah, they all are. Oh, you don't understand. I understand he ran over one my men. Well, I got to get back to headquarters. Ah, Detective, you mind if go with you? It's alright. I'll get my medical case. You want to come? Nope, I got to try it for lone chance. See if I can find him before they do. Let me go with you. No, I think you better come with me. They have to bring him in by force. We might need all the help that we can give. He's right. I don't stand much of a chance against the entire police force. Lieutenant Peterson's office. Had an accident? Where? Did they get him? Mmhm, right. Well, did anyone see him? Okay. Thank you. Hey, Lieutenant, Dr. McKenna had an accident. What? Yeah, he ran into a truck in an intersection. Did they get him? No. No? But you know how it is. A lot of people milling around. They didn't even know who's car was it until they check the registration. But didn't they try to stop him? He wasn't there. Somebody said they saw him running away from the accident. I guess he wasn't even hurt. Well, get all the extra men and you need to start setting up road blocks around this city. He won't get far. Yeah. Mmhmm. Good. Well, you let me if anything more happens. That was another report on your friend. Well, let's see. He was first reported buying gas just above here. Then somebody saw him right here. That last report places him just above you. I don't know what is holding those guys up. We should've a report by now. Perhaps he managed to slip through your net. Not a chance. Besides, he wouldn't caught daylight. And what you told me, daylight's what causes his spells of it. Yeah, it's true. Well, it's only a matter of time. The whole city has been alerted. Extra, extra! Read all about it! Extra, extra! Read all about it! Weird killer still at large. Thanks, Son. Extra, extra! Read all about it! Boy, I'll take one too. Extra, extra! Read all about it! Another night of fear and apprehension for all of us unless the search can reveal the monster. Hello, Mommy. Hi, Darling. Here, give me a kiss. How was school today? Terrible. I like to do a garden there. They made us for a few friendship. Mommy, can I have a glass of milk? Well, of course Darling. I'll get a glass. Let me pour it for you, Honey. I wanna pour it myself. Okay. We interrupt this broadcast for an urgent police bulletin. The latest news. The mad killer shows that the entire police force has been alerted and mobilized into searching parties. Every effort is being made to discover his hiding place. Since late last night, special squad had been on duty patrolling the streets extra men has been alerted Here you're through? for the entire Los Angeles area. Yes, I'm going out, Mommy. We ask your cooperation. Oh Darling, you better stay inside today. Mom, I wanna play outside. It's nice and sunny. Now, believed to be homicidal. Look, you get the drill like last time. Hello. Oh hello, Grace Oh no, I was just getting supper. Suzy! And above all, keep calm. And we return you once again to the King Sisters. Hey, just between us, what's the latest on this? Well all we is he's somewhere in the city. And he's really dangerous, huh? Homicidal? He's killed twice. He'll do it again. Well, we'll help all we can but boy, you got a tough one on your hands. It's a big city but we do know one thing. He's in a dark hole somewhere out of the sun. And as far a we could figure, he must be hiding somewhere in the Central Los Angeles area. No, I thought that we blocked all the roads last night. He isn't likely to move about the daylight. But keep checking with us. That's right, goodbye. Well, that charge what you told me, doesn't it? Yeah, he would have to stay inside during daylight hours. I can't bear to think of him out there alone. Hiding, so frightened. He's frightened? Everybody in town's frightened. They've locked themselves in their houses. You know, TV and radio is making a big deal out of this. Warning parents not to let the children go out alone till it's apprehended. Just how dangerous is he, Doctor? But you shouldn't be out here if you're sick, Mister. You should go to a doctor. No, I.. A doctor would would make you well and he wouldn't hurt you much. One time I went to a doctor, he stabbed me with a needle. It didn't hurt much. I can't go to a doctor. I can't leave here. Why not? Because the sun's bad for me. Oh no, the sun is good for you. One time I had a cold, and Mommy made me sit in the sun all day and it made me well. And you should eat a lot too. That's what Mommy says. Aren't you hungry? Hungry? Would you like me to bring you some cookies? I love cookies. Mommy always keeps me in the kitchen. I know where they are. Would you like me to bring you some? You do that for me? Yes. Then, you wanna help me? Yes. Then you mustn't tell anybody that I'm here. Not even Mommy? Not even Mommy. We've got to keep it a secret. Okay, I won't tell anybody. Hello, Mommy. Hi Dear, you shouldn't have gone out when I told you not to. What are you up to now? I just want some cookies. Well now Suzy, you know it's almost supper time. But I'm not gonna eat them now. Well, then leave them alone. You can have them for dessert. Suzy, what's gotten in to you today? You're not usually this bad. I want some cookies. You can have them for dessert. I told you that. But I want some now. But you can't have them now. It's too close to supper. I want cookies. Oh Darling, come here. What's the matter? They're for my friend. What friend? My new friend. Your new friend? Who is this new friend of yours? It's a secret, I can't tell. Oh Suzy, you don't expect me to believe that, do you? It's true, it's true. He's traveling all alone and he's sick and hungry. And I promised to bring to him some cookies. Out where? I can't tell, it's a secret. Suzy, you must tell me. No, I can't. Suzy, listen to me carefully. Who is this new friend of yours? Is he a man? A big grown up man like your daddy? Suzy, where is he? Where is he hiding? Suzy, you've got to tell me, where is he hiding? He's in the. He's where? Where is he? The shack. The shack! No Mommy, no! Listen carefully. Hello Operator. No Mommy, no. Can you please hurry. Hello, Police. I think I know where that man is hiding. Suzy! Excuse me, Lieutenant. We just got a call from a woman out there in the oil field. I think this could be the break we've been waiting for. You mean she knows where he is? She thinks so. He maybe hiding in a shack out there in their house. I've already alerted the squad in that area. Good, let's out there. Suzy, Suzy! Where are you, Darling? Suzy! Where are you? Suzy! Suzy? Suzy! Where have you gone? Suzy! My baby's in there. My god! Please, hurry. Don't worry Ma'am. We're doing everything we can. Don't cry, Anne. Perhaps you should cry. The rest of us can only hope that his life is not wasted.
