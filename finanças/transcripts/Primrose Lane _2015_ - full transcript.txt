(hand pounding) - Chris, open the door! (ominous orchestral music) I don't get the whole foreclosure thing. - They bought it at auction and apparently, they left it furnished. (laughs) I mean, it's a hell of a bonus. - If the previous owner got foreclosed on, why did they leave their furniture behind? - I don't know. Maybe they died and there's no heir to settle the estate. - Or, maybe they committed suicide and we get to sleep on their deathbed. - I'm sure you'll have a really pleasant conversation with Jack and Sue asking them all about that. - Foreclosure's bad jojo no matter how you slice it. (light orchestral music) - Do we really have to bring the dogs? It's not too late to drop them off at a kennel. - My babies are not being boarded. - Maybe if we had real babies, these could just be our dogs.

(fist rapping) (door knocker clanking) - So you thought it would be a good idea to drive all the way out here without confirming first? - (sighs) All right. Hey, it's Chris, we are here on your doorstep, not sure where you are. Okay, give us a call, bye. (somber music) (door clicking) (dog barking) Jack! (dog barking) Sue, it's us! (dog barking) And our dogs! (mysterious music) (door creaking) (Robin gasps) Sue? (boots tapping) (foreboding string music) - [Boy] Uncle Jack's. (moves into mysterious music) - Hello? Jack! (boots tapping) (light clicking) (door creaking) (lock clicking) - Why would they have a lock on the inside of the door? A panic room? - I don't know, maybe this used to be a basement instead of a closet? - Why would you have a lock on the inside of a basement? - I don't know? When I channel the original owner I'll let you know. (foreboding string music) (shoes tapping) (moves into tense violin music) - Hello. (shoes tapping) You hear that? - What? - Like a scratching sound or-- - It's probably just rats in the attic. (marble rattling) (light bell music) (solemn piano music) - Chris, it's been hours, maybe we should go? - [Chris] Relax, they'll be here. (keys jangling) (somber orchestral music) - Maybe we should call the police? - [Chris] To report what, exactly? - I don't know, missing persons, I guess. - You really think someone abducted a family of four? - Well, where are they? (ominous music) - I don't know where they are, but I'm sure there's a logical explanation. (ominous whispers) (phone ringing) - Where's the phone? - [Chris] I don't know, I'll check the kitchen. (ominous whispers) - [Jack] Hi, you've reached the Potts family. - [Children] Leave a message! - [Caller] Jack, hey, brother, I got your message. Very funny, call me, I want to come see that haunted house next month. (phone beeping) (phone beeping) (ominous orchestral music) - [Caller] Hello, hello? (shoes pounding) It's me, you have to leave! (phone ringing) (suspenseful orchestral music) (phone ringing) - Now can we call the police? (somber guitar music) - I wish there was something I could do to help you folks, but without more to go on, there's not much we can do. There's no sign of forced entry or a struggle. Are you sure they didn't leave town by way of cab and plane? Maybe they just wanted a technology-free family getaway. - Their keys are here. - Lots of folks have a spare set of travel keys, apart from the usual fully-loaded set. - The door was left open! - Well, we're trusting folks in this town. Yeah, I'm not saying that I recommend it-- - Thank you, officer. Sorry, my wife's just concerned. Is there anything else you can do at this point? - Well, I'll come by tomorrow afternoon to see if there've been any further developments. We can take it from there. - That'd be great, thanks. - Where would you go that you would leave your cell phone behind? - I don't know? I don't know why their cell phones are here, I don't know why their keys are here? I don't know why they're not here, I mean-- - You should have said something more to that cop, he should be doing something right now! - The cops don't care! All it means to them is a couple more hours of paperwork! (Robin huffs) I don't know, you want me to call another cop? - I want to leave! - I, I think we're probably overreacting, but if anything really is wrong, I think we should figure it out. - Why do you always have to stick your nose into everything? We never should have come in in the first place! - We were invited. - They're not home! - If this is anything more than a misunderstanding, I think we should get to the bottom of it! I would want Jack and Sue to do that if the roles were reversed, wouldn't you? Right? (Robin huffs) - Yeah. Yeah, (sighing) I would. - Look, (sighs) I'm sure the cop's right, everything's fine. Okay, come here. (sighs) We'll just, (sighs) make a night of it. (water splashing) (foreboding orchestral music) (water splashing) (mysterious string music) (ominous whispers) (marble rattling) Robin! (water splashing) Hey, did you... Hey. (Robin laughing) (wind rushing) (ominous whispering) (mysterious string music) Robin Laura Smith, I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I want to have babies with you, lots of 'em. (laughs) (Robin gasps) At least two, three. Will you marry me? - Yes. Yes. (light string music) (ominous whispers) (marble rattling) (ominous whispers) (somber orchestral music) - What are ya doin'? - I couldn't sleep. - You okay? - I know that we agreed on having kids. - Yeah. - But we're dependent on my income right now as it is and how do figure kids into the mix? - I don't know, we downsize. - I like our lives the way they are. You, me. - So what are you, what are you sayin'? (mysterious music) (ominous whispers) - I just don't want my whole life to be about driving to work, working all day, coming home at night, you know, like changing diapers. It's not my dream. - So, after eight years of marriage, it basically boils down to I don't make enough money and you don't want to change diapers. (somber orchestral music) That's great. What the fuck am I supposed to do? (door slamming) (wind howling) (ominous orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) (door creaking) (wind rushing) (ominous orchestral music) (wind howling) (marble rattling) (dramatic orchestral music) (winds rushing) (ominous whispers) (ominous orchestral music) (moves into shadowy bell music) (marble rattling) (moves into ominous orchestral music) (screaming) (dog barking) (screaming) (dramatic orchestral music) (screams) Get it off me! Get it off me! - [Robin] Chris! (Chris screams) Chris! (hand pounding) (Chris screams) Chris, open the door! (Chris gasping) - [Chris] Get it off me! (hand pounding) Where is it? - [Robin] Open the door! (Chris gasps) (dog barking) What, what, what? What? - Where is it? - What? What? (dog barking) - I don't know, it must have been? I don't know, I think it's uh, rats or something! (gasps) Oh, God, it was under my shirt! It was clawing my, my back. It was biting me. (dog barking) Oh, my God, where is it? (gasping) (dog whining) - Honey. (Chris gasping) Honey, honey. Honey. I don't see anything. - Yeah, it was uh-- - I don't see anything. - No, it was there. It was like a small animal and I was squeezing it! (dog barking) (shadowy orchestral music) (wicked dramatic music) I can't sleep. Shit! I'm scared. - It was probably just a dream, a nightmare. - (sighs) No, you don't understand it, it was real. I was awake, I felt it. - Maybe you were sleepwalking, hmm? (Chris sighs) Go to sleep. It's okay. (Chris sighs) (birds singing) What are you doing? - Just goin' out for a jog to clear my head. Maybe I'll find a neighbor who knows something about Jack and Sue. (ominous orchestral music) (grate scraping) (marbles rattling) (ominous whispers) (dramatic orchestral music) (mantel creaking) (dreary organ music) (marble rattling) - Father, there are holes in this house. - Nonsense, son. There are no better architects than the Hoss Brothers. (marble rattling) - Salty! (somber violin music) Pepper! (whistling) Salty! Pepper! (whistling) (claws scratching) There you go, huh. Where's your brother? Did Daddy take him out for a jog and not you? (can thumping) (eerie music) I'm losin' it. (mysterious string music) (pages rustling) (phone ringing) (Joel sighs) (phone ringing) - I was two steps away from Yogananda, (sighs) what do you want? - I think I need your help. - Princess, what troubles? (boots creaking) (Robin muttering) - Joel, you know me, I am not one to let my imagination get the best of me, (eerie music) come on. No, I, this place is such a money pit. - Maybe you got confused. - I know what I saw and-- - Don't hiss. - And then I went to her office and she had this journal and she's been tracking this thing. She had pages marked on the internet, she, (sighs) look, this house has a history. - Speakin' of history, I know just who you need. - Who I need is Chris. You think he left me because I told him? - Hell, no, he can't run that far. He's probably off brooding at some coffee house. If he doesn't come back in the time it takes to read the Times from cover to cover, (sighs) let me know. - There is so much weird shit in this house. (metal clanking) - (sighs) You were right, by the way, it needed to be said. I mean, (sighs) how do all you breeders sleep knowing there's all these mouths to feed all over the world. - Joel! - There are plenty of nice little Chinese babies in orphanages if you ever want to go that route. I would make a fabulous manny! - Joel! - Or and Uncle Chenchen! - Joel, I'm serious! - You need to see Dr. Hunt, she's right next door in Sierra Madre. I went to her when I was having an energy crisis last June, she's amazing! - Joel, I need help, I don't need crystal therapy. Can't you just come out here? - Let's see, my ghost-busting jumpsuit is at the dry cleaners and I have a date with Juan tonight. Yep, no can do. - Juan, is that the internet guy? - (sighs) Why do you have to make him sound so cheap, darling? - So you're gonna stand up your friend of 15 years, 15 years, Joel-- - What's the address again? (mower roaring) (somber orchestral music) - Hi, I'm friends with your neighbors, Jack and Sue. You don't happen to know where they are, do you? - Sorry, no. - My husband and I were supposed to spend the weekend with them and um, did my husband stop by this morning? - No. But, but hold on. Sweetie. Did somebody stop by this morning? - No. - Sorry we couldn't be of more help. (somber piano music) - If I get pregnant now, I'll lose my leverage and I may not get it back. - [Chris] If not now, when? - Give me two more years to stay focused on my career and then I promise, I promise. Hello, Dr. Hunt, please. My name's Robin, I was recommended to you by Joel Chen. Could you tell me a little bit about the type of work that you do. (suspenseful orchestral music) Chris! (boots tapping) Chris! (ominous whispering) Chris! (dramatic music) Chris! (moves into suspenseful orchestral music) Chris! Chris! (ominous whispering) Chris! (ominous whispering) (moves into dark tense music) (knob clicking) (fist knocking) (fist knocking) (fist knocking) (door clicking) - [Crystal] Hi, I got your call. - I'm sorry, I think you're confused, I don't live here. - No, no, no, it was definitely you. (mysterious music) - Excuse me, but who are you? - Crystal Finnegan, psychic. Maybe even a healer, I haven't really felt that one out yet. - Okay. (sighs) Did Joel put you up to this? - Joel? (sighs) (boots tapping) Quiet. - What? I wouldn't do that just yet. - So. It was Dr. Hunt, right? Of course, you're another one of her crystals. (laughs) How did you get this address? Oh, right, don't tell me, you're psychic. You've been psychic your whole life? - No, five or six weeks, give or take. (fist pounding) (boots tapping) (upbeat music) - Officer. - Ma'am. (laughs) I see that your friends have returned. - No, sir, in fact my husband went jogging this morning to talk to some of the neighbors and find anything else out. I'm concerned because he left without his phone, it's been over eight hours. - I see. Ma'am, it seems like you've got a lot of missing persons on your hands. - That's why you called me. - And you are? - No, no, wait, um. - Crystal Finnegan, psychic. - Ah, I understand. Well, then, it seems like you ladies are workin' this out. - No, officer! - You know where to find me! (Robin sighs) - Okay, I don't know who put you up to it, but I'm not game, thanks. - But you called me. - Right, well, if I need you, I'll call you back. Thank you! - But, whoa, whoa, whoa! I think if you-- - Bye! - [Crystal] I think I can help you! - Bye! Have a sparkly day! (suspenseful orchestral music) - [Boy] Here, puppy! (somber music) (dog barking) - Pepper! (dog barking) Pepper! (lock clicking) (suspenseful orchestral music) (dog barking) (lock clicking) (hand pounding) Who's in there? (dog barking) (lock clicking) Pepper, Pepper! Pepper! (dog barking) Pepper! (door shaking) Give me back my dog! (hand pounding) (suspenseful orchestral music) (lock clicking) (door creaking) Pepper! (wind howling) (dramatic orchestral music) (Emma humming) (soft Victorian music) - Mother, I'm going out now. - [Emma] Very well, my dear, but do remember our agreement, hmm? No more strays. Mr. Puff and Mistress Fluff are quite enough, we cannot save them all. - Yes, Mother. - Okay. (tense music) (suspenseful orchestral string music) (crow cawing) (dog barking) (horn beeping) (hopeful music) - Thank you for coming. - (sighs) Jewels from the queen. - Thank you, but what? - It's a mala, it helps you focus. You say a prayer and mantra for each bead. - Shit, that's a lot of prayin', Joel. I haven't really been in touch with the Almighty since I was about 10. (match striking) And I think it was something along the lines of, "God is neat, let us eat." (solemn music) - Now, blow out the flame. - [Robin] What's this supposed to do? - Cleanse, purify, remove negative energy-- - Oh, it smells like it's doing just the opposite. (coughs) - Open positive channels. (Robin coughing) Behave, you're not supposed to inhale. - (coughs) That's not what you said in college. (solemn music) Joel. (suspenseful orchestral music) That's where Pepper went missing. - Is there a basement? - Not that I'm aware of. - Darling, are you sure she didn't find an entry point or crawl space? Maybe she got out and decided to explore. - She was there. - You could have heard her below the house and mistake the noise as coming from inside the closet. - Oh, my God, you're right! - See, I'm sure. - You're totally right, oh, my God. Earlier today, this... (door knocker clanking) (ominous music) (door knocker clanking) That's her. - [Crystal] I, I can see you! I know you're in there. - (sighs) Hi. - Glad you called back. Ooh, and great malas. - How do you do that? (tense music) (door slamming) (shoes tapping) (watch scraping) (mysterious tonal music) (mysterious tonal music) - Um-hmm, it was pursuing him. - [Robin] What was? (tense music) - Ohh, that's gonna be a hard one for you to hold. (ominous music) - What do you mean by that? - He never went jogging. - Where did he go then? - Up, sort of. Is there an attic here? - (sighs) No, I wasn't exactly looking for one. - [Crystal] I'll be back in the morning with a ladder. (somber piano music) - [Joel] Mama, what do I do? I don't know what's going on here? - [Mama] (speaking foreign language), you listen to your heart and stand by your friend. - But what if I see a spirit or a ghost? Mama, you should see this place. - [Mama] You tell it to go away or you send him home to God! - Mama, what if it doesn't listen? - Then you run like hell! As fast as your ugly toe can carry you! - [Robin] Joel! - Mama, I have to go. (toilet flushing) I'm coming! (match striking) (tense percussion music) - What's that for, other than to stink? - A spirit barrier. Spirits can't tolerate burning incense. (sighs) - What if Salty and Pepper come back and break their legs in one of these? - I think I've come to know Salty and Pepper, they're not exactly stealthy creatures. We'll hear them coming. (tense percussion music) - Well, you just remember that when you go to the can in the middle of the night and break a toe. (beads clicking) (sighs) This is ridiculous. We're not even Christian. - Neither was Jesus. - (sighs) Where did you get this thing? - Online, it was listed as, Fuzzy Jesus Queen Blanket, it was meant for me. (beads clicking) (mysterious music) (gate creaking) - [Hunt] Your soul is signaling for help, you're having a serious energy struggle. - [Robin] My husband wants to have kids and, um, I'm not so sure. (mysterious music) - [Hunt] This is on a much grander, cosmic scale than that. (traps clapping) (Robin exclaiming) - A killer, a killer! What? (gasps) - Wait a second. (suspenseful violin music) No, wait, wait. It's not a rat, it's Chris' watch. - Huh. - How? (somber violin music) (sighs) I'm am all out of clothes. - Borrow something from your friend's closet. - Under the circumstances, that is creepy and wrong in too many ways. - I sense a need for an emergency fashion reconnaissance. - How can you think of shopping at a time like this? - Necessity is the mother of credit card intervention. Oh, look, we have enough time to make a run before Crystal gets here. Divide and conquer! You hit the juice bar and get my fresh, local, organic 85% vegetable juice and I'll outfit the troops. (dramatic orchestral music) (door creaking) (suspenseful orchestral music) (shoes tapping) (boards creaking) (Crystal sighs) (ominous music) (Crystal coughs) (moves into suspenseful orchestral music) (moves into dramatic orchestral music) - I think she might levitate. - Shut up. (moves into suspenseful orchestral music) (ominous whispers) Crystal! Crystal, Crystal! (chandelier rattling) (Crystal moaning) Are you okay? (Crystal gasping) - Faith precedes validation. You must dare to believe. - What does that mean? - That's the message they sent you. (mysterious music) - They, who? - Your guides. (sighs) Look, I didn't ask for this, either. There's a shift happening in our world that's like the veil is being lifted. - If this is gonna turn into some sort of apocalyptic sermon-- - It's not what I'm saying at all. There are no demons coming, they've been here all along. (mysterious string music) - [Wu] Madam, I move for you sewing into back room? - Oh, no, Wu, I like it here. - But, madam, Sir no like. Sir come home tomorrow. - Well, Wu, I like this room the best and I believe that women have a right to a vote. So, Sir will have to go. - Yes, madam. (somber music) (birds singing) (pensive piano music) - [Robin] Mm, what's this supposed to do, other than make my butt numb? - Prepare the body, prepare the mind, open your chakras to the infinite possibilities. - Possibility of what? - A spirit can understand, allow and believe in science, but science refuses to give credence to spirit. - There's evidence for science. - There's evidence for faith, but it's intuitive. If you refuse to feel, you're largely cut off. - How do you know it's not just a brain chemistry reaction? You're freaking me, it just, it all seems a little crazy town to me. - No one's trying to convert you, not everyone answers the call. - Then what's the point in all of this? How is it supposed to make any kind of difference? - [Crystal] That's where faith comes in. - Okay, well, what next because I think that my chakras are as open as they're gonna be. ♪ This is what's known as page, the last ♪ ♪ I'll tell you a secret, too ♪ (shoes tapping) ♪ It's put here at the end of the book ♪ ♪ To show that you've read it through. ♪ ♪ Good night ♪ Do I get a kiss? - I don't go! - Come on, it's time for bed. (child whines) - Come on. - No go! It's time for bed. (Myrtle crying) - [Myrtle] (crying) Mama! Mama! I miss you! (crying) Mama! (ominous music) (train whistle blaring) (ominous music) - Emma. My love. Why aren't you in bed? (Emma sighs) - I'm so glad you've returned. - Emma, what's all this? - (sighs) Oh. (laughs) Love, the light in the morning to sew by is so divine-- - There are plenty of rooms with sufficient lighting for your hobbies in this house. I'll not have all this folderol cluttering up my parlor. This is where I like to sit with my thoughts. It's where we entertain guests. - Yes, dear, but that is why I made the curtains. We can obscure any eyesore-- - It's fine for now, but I have to be back on the line in a week's time. I expect all of this to be elsewhere upon my return. Is my meaning clear? - Yes, dear. - Emma, I have missed you. Now, away with you, I'll be up presently. I just want to have a little smoke. - They were here in this room. They were here. - "American Secretary of Interior Attacked." Did you see this, darling? The Secretary of Interior-- - Dr. and Mrs. Ebald Lickybug to see you. - It's Dr. Ewald Lichtenburg. Lichtenburg. - Bickybug, you devil! - Ah! - (laughs) What strange machinations have you and your sorceress been brewing up now, eh? - She's said to raise the spirits from the great beyond this eve. She's ripe raving mad, no doubt. I could devour you. (Emma gasps) But, alas, it behooves me to humor her such that her beauty doth disown me. - Let the evidence speak for itself. (William laughs) - Free the cats to prowl, good man. Perhaps you and I can raise old Lucky catch a hint of the race outcomes. - [William] (laughs) I'd sooner know the direction of an new rail line. (Ewald laughs) - Oh, yes, I know this one. Keats, yes? - Indeed. - Of course. - They were here. They have your dogs. - Why? - I don't know? They were definitely here. - What-- - No, no, no. (sighs) Nope, nothing. - What am I supposed to do with that? - Dust for prints. - Wait for the answer and believe it will come. - Right. (door knocker clanking) - Friend, I fear you tread a dangerous territory by harboring that Asian. There's word of penalties being levied against employers of the illegals. How many paper sons has he ushered across our borders now? - I'm not one to judge the accuracy of one's personal affairs. - He would be one ripe fertile bastard were it true, huh? (laughs) In San Francisco, they've begun sequestering them at port for questioning. Why not let him go before the cauldron gets too hot. - We'll do nothing of the sort! (Ewald laughs) Wu has every right to be here, he's an asset to our family and our home. - (laughs) Firecracker! Careful, lest ye be burned. - Oh, I fear I should be cautioning you with the same. - I am afraid I really must agree with my good Doctor. Pray, what makes you so keenly fond of him? - Wu, his name is Wu. - What stokes your affection for Wu, then? - A hearty respect for the value of his heritage and skills. - You sport an interesting preoccupation to concern yourself with such matters of your household help. - I make it my concern to know well who is under the roof. - And what so fascinates you in the tales of the Orient? - Wu hails from a family of farmers, generations spanning hundreds of years, taking pride in the land. His grandfather cultivated herbs and disciplined himself in the healing arts, a trade passed down to Wu. - [Theodocia] What of it? - With no legal authority to purchase land in the United States, he is prevented from fulling exercising his skilled trade. (light string music) - Madam, you take tonic now? - No, Wu, I think not. Dreadful tasting stuff. - But, doctors say-- - Wu. - I make for you herb from my country for heal. - My Lord will provide a way for me, Wu. - But you tire. - I'm only tired of being here without William. Any word of his return? - No, madam. Important work take long time. - I suppose. - He fancies himself a farming doctor, does he? (Ewald laughs) - What does it say of a people who are pleased enough to break a man to benefit from his labor with no regard for his welfare? - Hmm, bravo. - Your butler lives in gainful employ in circumstances that must far outweigh that which he left behind. If his willingness to risk the guise of authentic right and relation to cross borders is any indication, he is content with the opportunities our glorious land holds? - When William plucked him from his work on the rails, he had not been paid his rightful wage due for weeks. The only payment doled out to him was a regular threat of report and deportation. My, love. - He could have discreetly sought employment elsewhere if he found his conditions unfavorable. - That's irrelevant. (mysterious music) The treatment of his people is a mockery of justice. With no right to testify against a white man in our judicial system, we might as well call them slaves. - Who is mocking justice? Friend, has honesty no value in your code of ethics? He and his kind have perpetrated a most cunning deceit, manipulating our borders and seizing upon our vulnerability in the aftermath of devastation. Do I interpret correctly that you welcome any palette of people who seek liberation from their own spoiled soil to enter our promise land through a passageway of lies? 'Tis as much illegal as it is immoral. (Ewald laughs) - I'm afraid I do not consider flight from a perilous political climate a deviation from ones morals. Pray, that you should never be faced with such a terrifying potential. (glass clinking) (men laughing) - Then where does one draw the line to guard, rightly, all our glorious nation affords? - I suggest that a justified citizen is one who furthers social development, upholds civic responsibility and weaves tight the moral fabric of our culture. - Agreed! - Ah-ha! - Agreed, agreed, agreed! But the Asian is not our culture and his morals are called, rightly, in question. Next, you'll be trading in your silver for chopsticks. (men laughing) - I'm afraid I cannot see the merit of skin color or origin of birth in the components which, I believe, propagate a thriving community. - My. (train whistle blaring) Clearly her thoughts are well informed. - Why either of them married is beyond me. They should have both been schoolmarms chirping from a lector. - (laughs) I envision them more as Johnson and Jeffries in the ring. As fierce as they are, you should tread lightly, less the suffragettes have their way. - She is here! (door creaking) (light suspenseful music) - Prophetess. Retrieve my bowls. (bowl singing) Have you prepared the supplicant? - Uh, no. - Tone in. (bowls singing) (machine humming) (light suspenseful music) (bowls singing) (machine humming) (machine humming) (bowls singing) (machine humming) Use caution here. - Why? That's where my dog went missing. - When you're ready to receive the answers, they'll come. - Look, my friends and my family are missing, so if you know something that I don't, lay it on me. (dramatic orchestral music) - The crystal beneath the earth in this region has created a portal above this house, allowing energy to pass through from one realm to another. They've all passed through. (shocking music) (moves into somber music) These gateways to the gods were not intended for mortals. - I am sorry to shift the course, but the night is not growing younger and if you would all like to witness a true marvel, a glimpse into the hereafter and the wisdom of the infinite, you must all gather around the table this very instant. (ominous music) - You have a much deeper connection to the universe then you're willing to acknowledge. (somber music) (crystals clinking) Allow yourself to remember. Trust your intuition. - My intuition was telling me to get out of this house from the get-go. - Well, the moment to have acted on that impulse has passed. (sighs) (ominous whispers) You're here. You already crossed over and returned. - I don't understand, I never left the couch? - You haven't yet, but you will. - You've completely lost me. - Forget your ideas about time. The soul is energy, it transcends time and space. Energy can split, but it can only occupy one body at any given moment. The future you is trying to communicate with you. It's unable to physically manifest. (lively violin music) (bell ringing) - Doctor Lickybug, how may I help you, sir? (shoes tapping) (door clicking) - Lichtenburg. Lichtenburg, if I can say your name, good man, why can't you say mine, Vu? - Wu. - Vu. - Wu. - Vu. - Wu. - That's what I'm saying, Vu. - Wu. - Vu. - Wu.
