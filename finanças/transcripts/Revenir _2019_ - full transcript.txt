- Here you go. - Thanks. - Have a good day. - Goodbye. Hi. You all alone? Is your grandpa around? Here. Don't move, I'll be back. Hey, who are you? Sorry, I'm Thomas. Mathieu's brother. The kid fell. He did? Where? In the courtyard. Nothing serious, just a scrape. I'm coming. Here, I'll do it. Excuse me. - What did you do this time? - I fell. - When did it happen? - Just now. No! Stop whining, it'll be quick. 1, 2, 3. All done. - Did your dad call you? - No, my mother left a message. How is she? Not well. Your dad's been sleeping there since Tuesday. I can't go because of the kid. - Mom! - Fuck. Coming! What? Who's he? Who is he? He's family. How is she? She'll sleep through till tonight. Come back tomorrow morning. Okay. Mona and the kid are okay? I think so. Dad. Need me to bring you anything? Don't bother. I didn't want her to call you. Did you see your mom? No. She wasn't awake. Anything new? No. If you want your room back, I can sleep with the kid. No, thanks. The couch is fine. Suit yourself. What grade are you in? First. You'll learn to read. Granny already taught me. That was her job before. I know. When will she be back? I don't know. Soon, I guess. Yes, but when? I don't know. When she's better. I don't believe you. I took a bottle of red. Your dad filled up and then he stopped drinking. So there's plenty. He doesn't drink anymore? Not since your mom got sick. Put this over here. What happened to the cows? Sold. When's that? Just so you know, it didn't pay off the debts. Why'd you do that? Why'd you do that, huh? Answer me! You think it's funny? Alex, come back here. Leave me alone! Stop it, don't touch me! Don't touch me! - No! - Calm down. C'mon, calm down. Put me down! Stop it! Don't touch me! Wait here. Here. Was my dad your brother? Yes. Your little brother? Yes. I'm going to bed. I'm not hungry. Hello. How is she? The nurse is with her. Hello. This will take a while. Here, want some? I'd rather you didn't use Mathieu's bike. So, I'm supposed to walk here? When did you get back? Yesterday. - Did you see the kid? - Yeah. He's handsome, isn't he? He's the best. You still don't have any? No. But the restaurant's doing well. I'm real happy. You have a girl? No. Not really. Good. Makes for less trouble. Just look at me... All the trouble I make for your dad. Stop it. You two need to start getting along. Mom, are you okay? Want me to call the nurse? No, I'm fine. Go on. Go home now. Go for a ride. It's a beautiful day. I'll see you tomorrow? I didn't come back to go for rides. I know, son. It's nice you came home. I was afraid you wouldn't come. You're so handsome too. You got any spare cash? I don't have enough to pay them. - How much do you need? - Thirty euros. Thanks. - Thanks. - Goodbye, see you soon. - Was that my mom's idea? - Yeah. She really insisted. Your dad gave in and ordered them, but then he forgot. How's Granny? She sends you her love. There's water in the fields. - And? - A whole area is flooded. You know what happened? No, no idea. Stay there, muffin. I have a favor to ask. Could you watch him for me? I missed work all week and they need me. I'm scheduled this afternoon and tonight. Yeah, sure. It's a big help, thanks. - You need a ride? - No, that's okay. - Mom, come here! - Hang on! I'll try not to be late. Let's go to the pool. It's hot out! - Not today. - Why not? We're waiting for Gramps. - How's this? - It's cold! It'll cool you off. I want to get out. That better? Hang on. Here. You okay? Hey, stranger. Thomas! Hey, Marco. Strawberry or mint syrup? - Mint. - Okay. There's water in my dad's field. Your brother found a spring. It supplied the stables and back field. The pipe must've broken. The back field is ours now. It's good soil. Your brother sold land to get by. And my dad let him? Mathieu handled things. Besides, he didn't have much choice. Want to see the animals? Can I go see the animals? Sure. I want to talk about the accident. Why are you asking me? My dad and I haven't talked in 12 years and my mom won't say anything. They went wild boar hunting. You guys weren't with them? We'd had a falling out. Your dad signed up on the municipal candidate list. For the far-right. - Mathieu too? - Yes. Then who'd they go with? They went alone. Just the two of them? They followed a male into the woods. They must've got caught up in brambles or something. Your old man tripped and his gun fired. You didn't know? No. I'm sorry. It's your dad who told us. We've gone organic. We sell to retailers to survive. The supermarkets sell milk cheaper than we can make it. They say, "Produce more volume and you'll be fine." That's the way it is. Once a peasant always a peasant. Can't change destiny. And... did Mathieu go organic too? No. He wanted to expand. He borrowed money. Then he worked nights as a mechanic to make ends meet. He said you were smart to get out of here. - Her name is Beyoncé. - What? Beyoncé. That's it, a little bit more. - Want to see if she can walk? - Yes. Let's give it a try. Don't move. Nice and easy. We'll try to help her stand. Come on girl. Come on. That's it. Come here. See? She can stand. I can't quite let go. - Yes, I can. - She's in attack position. Come pet her on the head. She's soft. Want to feed her again? Okay, c'mon. Come on girl. Your turn to hide. - No, it's bedtime. - No. - Alex... - Read me a story. C'mon, read me a story. Here. Get under the covers first. Read the beginning. Granny always starts at the beginning. Was this really your room? Yes, it was. How old were you? I was your age. And then a bit older too. My dad slept in the next room. Yeah. Did you guys get along? Yes. We got along very well. My dad died in the woods. Granny says his soul is still there. You think it's true? Of course. Granny's never wrong about these things. Why don't we have cows anymore? Because they cost too much. Your friends have cows. Besides, cows make milk so you can make lots of money selling it. Yeah. Come here. "The Dinosaurs." With Gramps in the garden. At Jabron. Mathieu finally has a motorcycle! Like father, like son... Thanks, Maria. See you tomorrow. You're not in bed? No. Everything okay? They kept buying me drinks and I can never say no. Then I won't offer you another. No. But I can stay up with you. Oh, why not? One last one. How'd it go? He wasn't a pain? No. He's great. Depends on the day. Thanks. Thinking about your mom? Where's yours? She ran off long ago. Off in the wilds? Yeah, that's it. Let's say I was unlucky. She had me at 16 and never grew attached. After that, well you know... No. Sure you do. Trouble, homes and foster families. Then more trouble, homes and foster families. When was the last time you called your mom? I don't know. Six months ago. She's been through hell. That's why she stopped calling. She was too proud. Why didn't you come to the funeral? My old man didn't want me to. He said that? Yes. - Good night. - You too. He looks like Uncle Jean. Your brother. They've got the same nose and eyes. He'll probably attend Victor Hugo too. They thought they were rid of us Morenos. But no. We're back again. He'll be a good student. He'll make it far, I'm sure of it. You want the chair? Go home. She needs to rest. Why don't you go? I can stay. Go on, I said. I'll take care of her. - Excuse me. - Yes. I'm the son of Mrs. Moreno in room 376. Can I give you my number, just in case? Isn't your father here? Yes, but I'd still rather you had my number. Okay. Here. Thanks. Ouch! - Who lives here? - A Dutch family. - You know them? - Don't worry, come on. Here. Hey, Alex! Wait for me. Come on, Thomas! Scaredy-cat! The owners never come? Only for Christmas. So it's all ours. Ready? Yes. Want some? Thanks. Could you watch him again tonight? It's Saturday, I have to go. Yes of course. He told me about the cows. He loved them. Oh yeah? I get it all wrong with him. - It's not true. - Yes it is. I always get mad and shout. How did you meet Mathieu? At The Must. He hung out there? No, not really. He looked so unhappy. That's what I liked. What's your job there? Waitress. Well, supposedly I'm the boss. But it's all fucked up. Even with a degree there's no work. Thomas, do I swim good? Great. What'll you do afterwards? When my mom's gone. She's here for now, right? You can't spend your whole life here. Your dad will never get over it. When Mathieu died, they were crushed but they helped me. Me and Alex. And I'm gonna let him die alone, like a dog? I don't know what happened, but it's the past. Let it go. He's your dad, you know. - You hungry, Alex? - What's there to eat? Beef stew. What do you think? Ham sandwiches. - Want one? - No, thanks. First you get out and drink some water. Come on. Here. More. Come sit down to eat. Here. Thank you. Taste good? Let it ring. I'll get it. Hello? Hello? Yeah. Yeah. It's for you. Hello. Stop it! Fine, and you? - If you want. Where? - If you want. Be quiet! Be quiet! Okay, see you. Okay, see you. I'm silly. I'm silly! You better watch out! - How's it going? - Good. - You came alone? - Yes. - What are you drinking? - Same as you. Waiter! Can we have another one? Eric told me you didn't know about what happened to your brother. No. It didn't happen like he said. I was driving by the farm and I saw Mathieu. He was going off alone. - Hunting? - No. He went off alone, with his rifle. He cut through the field and into the woods. Your dad ran out of the house after him, but when he reached the field... It was too late. He'd fired. He couldn't take anymore. He didn't pull the trigger. It was the bank. They were going to take everything. Your folks would've been out on the street. Your dad never told anyone the truth. So he invented that story. No one knows. Not even my brother. And it has to stay that way. Your dad had his own reasons, but the insurance company paid up. If it was suicide, they wouldn't have paid a cent. The house and land would've been sold. I like your old man. He was really someone. He only joined the fascists because he felt abandoned by everyone. He's not really one. I didn't want you thinking he was involved in your brother's death. It's complicated enough between you. Mona? Alex? - Enjoy yourself. - Thanks. - Sorry, I'm late. - No problem. - Where's Alex? - Want something to drink? A beer. Coming up. - Champagne for the table over there. - Okay. - What'll it be? - One mojito. Yes? - Another beer, please. - Yours is coming. Muffin. Wake up. Thomas will take you home. Put on your shoes. Come on, muffin. Thanks. With that crowd, I won't be home early. Here. Come on, little man. Take this in case he's cold. No. Thomas! Look! Hang on tight. Look. Sorry, you okay? It's pretty, isn't it? That's it, he's gone. At last, I get my bed back. Stop it! Little dumbbell. That's enough. Here. - Will you stay? - No, I'm going to bed. I mean, will you stay here with us? I'll stay a few days. After that, I have to go home. I have to work, you know. Where's your home? Canada. Montreal. Is that far? I'll come back to see you. Where's my giraffe? Here. Time for bed now. You'll be wiped out tomorrow. Leave the light on in the hallway. Okay. Good night. - And the door stays open. - Okay. Hello? Yes, it's me. Okay. Thanks. This is it. Thanks. - Get home safe. - Good night. Thomas! Mom? - Want some hot chocolate? - Yes. Here. Thank you. Here. Thanks. I'm going to the hospital. My mom has passed away. Alex is in the kitchen. Did you tell him? No. You think I could... stay with her? Just for a minute. Please. What's that? Mom's olive trees. Did you plant them? Yes. Come on. - You okay? - Yeah. Where's the bike? I'll pick it up tomorrow. What's he doing? - Want something to drink? - Yes, please. Michel? I'll take wine. Where's Alex? He's playing. The olive trees will die without water. There's plenty of water. The field's a marsh. I didn't know Mathieu found a spring. You never knew anything that went on here. Come sit down. To Granny. To Mom. Dad. To Mom. You think you're the only one in pain? Alex! Alex! Myriam, it's Mona. Alex's mom. Is the kid at your place? About an hour ago. He was playing in the courtyard. No, I already called. Okay. Yeah, okay. Thanks. He's nowhere. I don't understand. You don't leave kids unattended. - I'll try the woods. - He never goes there. You never know. Call me if he comes back. I'll try the other side. - I'll come. - No, you stay here. In case he comes back. Alex! Alex! Alexandre! Alexandre! Dad? Dad! Are you alright? You okay? Did you hurt yourself? Can you get up? Dad? Can you get up? Come on. Okay, hang on. Alex! Why'd you do that? I'm sorry. Promise you'll never do that again. You promise? Where'd you go? To see the baby calf. He walked 4 miles. Thank you. Even Grandpa was looking for you. - Is he here? - Yes. - Granny too? - No. Where is she? Want me to help you to your room? I'll sleep here. You hungry? Okay. Good night. You too. I don't want you to tell me. Don't say anything. Where do you think she is now? I don't know. Want to come sit with us? No, I want to think about her. Thomas. How's your hip? Better. Did you get some sleep? Yes. What'll you do now? Very funny. You can't not think about it. I met your mom when I was 19. And you ask what I'll do without her? It's the first time I've woken up without her. The first time I've had coffee without her. And everything else will be the same. The best would be to sell everything and pay off the debts. Give the rest to you, Mona and the kid. I did what I could. I'll repair the leak. We can't let water run off like that. You got a quick-connect coupler? In the back of the tool shed. Take my boots in the hallway. You'll mess up your shoes. - Here. - Thanks. Did you see? Four times. You count, okay? Okay. - You're wearing boots? - I have to repair the leak.
