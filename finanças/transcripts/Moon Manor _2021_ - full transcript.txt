Come on. Fly, fly, fly. Oh, yeah. Whoa. Hey, Jimmy. I-I want to invite you to something. It's tonight. It's only a few blocks from here. It's over on... I can't even remember my own street... shit! Anyway, it's on the invitation. - Yeah, for sure. - Please, come. - Yeah, for sure, for sure. - Okay, cool. - Salud. - Have a good one. See you. It says, "You're invited to Jimmy's FUN-eral." Like a funeral, but it's fun. Oh, good morning, Miss Winnie. Is your mother home? I don't care what Grandma said. No. Can you please put her on the phone? Jimmy, I'm here. Hi, Mom? Oh, don't forget, the gathering is tonight. - Oh, that's tonight! - Yeah, yeah. That's actually perfect timing, because Winnie's goldfish just died, and she's asking about mortality. Get up, get up, Jimmy. Shit. This is for Miss Winnie. What does he have for you? - For you, mademoiselle. - A swan! - What do you say to Jimmy? - Thank you. - Thank you, Jimmy, bye, Jimmy! - Bye, Jimmy! Sure, you can call me an activist. Call me what you will if you need... ...a caricature or whatever. Hi. I'm Andrew. I'm... I'm the writer. ...an activist is a state of mind, - isn't it? - Okay. How many times do we have to go through this? You know you can't go out alone. I'm fine. I just went next door to give Winnie a little something. Karen wanted to have coffees. Are you done? Because I know you're lying. Karen gave up coffee, like, two years ago. Well, it's never going to happen again... after tonight. - No. - Yes. - No. - Yes, yes. It's time, it's... I'm ready. You are the best caregiver a fella could ever want to have. - I'm so lucky to have you. - Mm-hmm. And I'll tell you something. Ours is a strange and wonderful relationship. You're strange, I'm wonderful. Um, I have your outfit, but I actually am digging this one. - Why don't you wear this? - No, no, no, look at these eyes. I need blue to bring them out. Oh, my God. You're such a flirt. Do you want me to bring it to you? Are you gonna wait here? I'll bring it to you. Okay. Oh, I totally thought that you had gone and done it, and I'd have to make an announcement to everybody... Hi. Jimmy, right? I'm Andrew. So nice to finally meet you. Hello, Andrew. May I help you? I'm the writer. I'm here to write an article about you and what you're doing. Article. What article? Um... Gotcha! I'm just kidding. I'm messing with you. Come on in, I... it's an Alzheimer's joke. Stop doing that. Why not? It's fun. I... would do the same thing. For you, good sir. Thank you. - Are you hungry? - Sure. Come in. Very good. Now, let's add it to the rest of the sentences. - You don't mind, do you? - No, not at all. Take my soul. - San Pedro cactus. - Yes. Delightfully phallic, don't you think? Uh, active compound is mescaline. "If the doors of perception were cleansed, "everything would appear to man as it truly is... infinite." Oh, I don't do photos. I'm-I'm sorry. Buzz me if you need anything. So, how many of these have you done? Well, I've done a plethora of obituaries, but you happen to be my first pre-dead interview. "Pre-dead." What a way to put it. Um, it's jargon amongst obituary writers. Rule of thumb, factual over fancy. Hmm. I wouldn't think that of you, though, your writing is so... so elegant and thoughtful. I'm honored. And I have to thank you. Because... Because of you, I-I finally got a feature approved. You, this, is going to be my first feature. Well, this will be my first death. I would love to start with word association. Uh, I know it sounds childish, but it could be a fun icebreaker. Love it. No problem. - I'll say a word... - Mm-hmm. and... you just say the first word that comes to mind, and that's where we'll begin. Okay, shoot. Blanket. Pigs. Pigs in a blanket. I... I was thinking more of, um, like a memory. - Or a... life story. - Oh, okay. Right, I got it. Okay. Before or after LSD. - Let's start with before. - Okay, before. Pigs... blanket... Oh, my God. I was ten years old, and my kid brother used my blanket as bait. It's amazing how memory works. Just like a moment suspended in time. Jimmy! Come here. Come here! Hey... stop! No! No! How long were you in there for? Oh, hours! He was doing a scientific experiment on me. You, um... never mentioned a brother. Yeah, we don't get along. Do you have any siblings? - I have a sister. - Ahh. Well then, you know what I'm talking about. Yeah. I love her, but we're quite different. Mm. How so? Well, I'm a minimalist, and... she's pretty much a hoarder. You'd never believe her collection of porcelain ponies. Sounds like my kind of woman. Wow. Wow. So tell me, on a scale of one to ten, how much do I have your sister beat? Well, she still wins, but it's very impressive. So, this is your legitimate business? You actually sell land on the moon? Oh, yes. No government can claim ownership of a celestial body, but an individual can. This is according to the United Nations Space Treaty, by the way. I figured, "Hey, this is a loophole." Now, what do you do when you see a loophole? Right? You jump through it. That's exactly what I did. What was your favorite thing about the job? Oh, I think selling hope. Selling whimsy. The idea there was something greater than ourselves. You know what I mean? I liked... seeing people feel like a kid again. What-What is this thing? Ah, yes. This, my friend, is a moon rock from the Ocean of Storms, a magma sea a thousand miles wide and hundreds of miles deep. The theory is it used to be part of a... a tiny moon, a second moon that we had, and they both collided, thus forming the Ocean of Storms. Have a look. How did you get a moon rock? An astronaut gave it to me. I'm not gonna say who. Don't ask. But if you turn it over, you'll see he carved his name on the bottom. Welcome to dating for anyone over 60. Sharon promised she'd get her CD out of here. It's been stuck for months. Well, she got roped into doing the mission in Mexico, - so maybe she forgot. - Typical. Nice gal, but flighty as a flamingo. That's what I admire about you, Terry. Your consistency, reliability. That's why I felt compelled to bring you along with me today. - There are... - Flamingos fly? Yes, Terry. Flamingos can fly. Cool. - This is a house call. - Yes. Oh, eh... um... yeah, I... I thought we were we weren't allowed to do house calls after what happened last time. This isn't like last time. Less public. - Just you and me. - Oh... oh, okay. Yeah, yeah-yeah, that-that makes sense. You want to shut that curtain? You'll get a kick out of this. Do you have someone that you want to impress but don't want this reaction? Is this a sketch comedy thing? It's an infomercial for my business. ...totally out of this world. Celestial real estate, a cosmonaut's dream. Oh, my stars. Hi. I'm Jimmy, owner of Lunatics, your solar system's friendliest celestial real estate agency. At Lunatics, we believe that... space is for everyone. - Even me? - Oh, especially you, alien. Well, that just makes me wanna dance. Well, go to it. But wait, there's more. Call back within the next 15 minutes, and we're going to send you, free of charge, your choice of one of these three beautiful, adorable Moonie Babies. Wait, you created the Moonie Babies? Not to be confused with the cult. No. My friend, he-he had those growing up. Oh, you know, that was actually Tara's idea before she became an escort and got hit by a car. Oh, my God. ...an egg, because in all actuality, the moon is actually shaped like an egg, even though it looks round to us down here on Earth. - What? - Lunatics! So give Lunatics a call today, because everybody's saying it. Nothing could be greater than to own a lunar crater. That's right. Give the present that's literally out of this multiverse. I can't believe you're the Moonie Baby man. This is mental! Which one did your friend have? It was the, um... the one... it's an alien, and it shot out a puff of glitter. - I wanted one so bad. - Oh, no. We had to discontinue that one altogether. Can't talk about it. Legal reasons. Smuggling, trafficking. Yeah. But before I was the moon man, I was the music man. ♪ Here we are ♪ ♪ Sittin' alone once again ♪ ♪ Sharing our thoughts ♪ ♪ Taking the time to... remember when ♪ Now that's Ricky on the right. The love of my life. This is one of our original sets. Did you guys ever make it big? No... you know, a lot of our friends did. Robin Williams, Letterman, Leno. They're part of the 3% that actually become superstars. But we were part of the 20%. We always worked. So were you disappointed that... that it didn't work out? You know, I always thought that we were like Michael Collins. Nobody remembers who he was. But he was the third astronaut on the Apollo 11. The ones that people remember are... Buzz and Armstrong. So I think our careers were kind of like him. Just because we didn't make it into becoming a household name doesn't mean that we didn't earn our place in the stars. - This one right here? - Yes. Park here. It's nice. A lot of succulents. Yes. Come, let us pray. Yes. Dear Heavenly Father, please help us save this man's soul today, to guide him from the choice of darkness to the choice of light. Picture this. It's 1969. Over half a million people are gathered on the National Mall in Washington D.C. protesting the war in Vietnam. Ricky and I, we were on the main stage with the cast of "HAIR." Timothy Leary and Pete Seeger was leading this massive crowd, singing "Give Peace a Chance." We were designated to go to the side of the stage and release these beautiful white doves, symbols of peace, into the air. So we pick up the doves, we toss them high into the air, and their wings were frozen with the cold weather. So they just fucking torpedoed right into the crowd. So we pick up a couple of more, and we decide to shake 'em up a little bit. warm 'em, kinda... come on, try again. And we toss them up in the air, and they try to fly, and bam, bam! Into the crowd again. Oh, it was pitiful. Do you have any allergies? So, Ricky... let's talk more about him. When did you meet? We met at the audition for "HAIR." He was ahead of me in the audition line. You do know the Broadway rock musical "HAIR"? That's the one about naked hippies and hair, right? Are you kidding? No, it's so much more than that. It was, like... it was, like, about revolution. Vietnam, classism, activism, free love. It was actually a movement through art, and we thought that we were truly being heard, and we were. I'll tell you something. Everybody wanted to be a part of that show. Ahh, terrific. Another one. You bring you own sheet music? Great. Get ready for a long wait.

"Hey, friend. I see you there." "Rose! I'm sorry." Scene. Um, can I get your advice on something? Shoot. I'm thinking about changing my stage name to Ricko the Sicko. What do you think?

I could hear him, he was going, ♪ Calling you... ♪ He was really, he was, oh, he was very bad. I felt sorry for him. Is he still in your life? No. We lost him to the AIDS epidemic. Are you wanting to ask me if I have it? - Yes. - Well... I've been HIV positive for over 35 years, and I've never had an age-related illness. Diligent with my meds, don't eat red meat, smoke my weed. There's not much drama there, I'm afraid. Were you with Ricky when he passed away? You can say "died." "Passing away" always seems such an odd way to talk about death. You pass someone in the freeway, you... you pass an exam, you pass gas. "Passing away," that's too easy. Were you with Ricky when he died? Yeah, I was with him. Just as you will be tonight when I die. You want me to be in the room? Well, yeah, I mean, that's the whole point of you being here, isn't it? You're... You're a part of this, Unless you're uncomfortable with it. I'd understand. No, I... I can be there. And here we go. Oh! Did you paint this? - Uh-huh. - Really impressive. Oil or acrylic? Well, it's technically mixed media. I use some paint, collage, um, and then even a little bit of... um, melted wax for preservation. I love the fact that you have me up in Heaven. Yes... yeah, both of us are in Heaven. My only thing is I wish that I had been on the right side of our Lord instead of on the left. That's all! You meant Jesus' right, not our right. - Yes. - Oh, I see, I got confused. - That's okay. - Sorry, I-I-I... I mean, I can probably change it. No, no-no-no, don't worry about it. What method did you choose? The pills. Huh. What, does that surprise you? Oh, no, uh... it's just, most people don't like taking that many pills. They didn't know me in the 80's. Any burial plans? I'm not a fan of embalming. Too many chemicals. Cremation, that... that pollutes the air. I just opted for a good, old-fashioned natural burial. Help those plants grow. Oh, I got... I gotta go to the loo. Yes, this poster will work wonders for the Lord... eh... oh! Hi. Could you roll your window down? Would you mind rolling your window down? Oh, uh... - Hi. - Hi. What you guys selling? Oh, we're not selling anything. Really? Because it looks like you're "selling" something. Oh, we're not... - we're not selling... - No-no-no, I... I can handle this, Terry. We're here to save a soul. And we do it through the word of God. Here. Oh, do you have any more of these? - Yes. - Okay. Is that all you've got? Can I... - Uh, well... - I think that we might have... No, no, Terry. We have to conserve some of these for our own use. But we're pleased that you want to spread the word of the Lord. Amen. Yeah, you know what? Trust me, I will spread these. I really will. - Yeah. Be well, sister. - And be well, brother. Spread 'em! - Terry, do you have any more? - Spread the word! Uh... Spread it all over the place. She's going into that den of iniquity! She's not gonna spread the word? Resist! Resist! - Put up your fists! - Not till I say, Terry! - Hi. - Hi, Remy. There are two gentlemen out there ready to storm the gates. Are you ready? - Yes. - Three, two, one. Fight, fight! Fight for your right to live! Don't say bye. Do not die. Fight, fight! Fight for your right to live. Don't say bye! Do not die! Fight, fight! Fight for your right to live. Don't say bye! Do not die! - Hi. - Fight! Fight! I'm Fritti Femmedoulla. Ahh, hi. Andrew. Writer. He's here to write about Jimmy and... you know. - Don't say bye! Do not die! - Oh! Do you mind if I talk to you inside for a second? - Sure. - Fight for your right to live! - Don't say bye! Do not die! - Those who cast stones. Fight! Fight for your right to live! Don't say bye! Do not die! What sort of things do you write about? Obituaries right now, but Jimmy is gonna be my first feature. Oh, congratulations. Although I've never heard of press at a transition. Oh, Jimmy reached out. I guess he had seen my work. I'm sorry. Fruity? Who are you? Fight! Fight for your right to live! It's Fritti. And I'm Jimmy's death doula. - Doula? - Death doula. - Death doula? - Death doula. Yeah, it's sort of like a midwife or a birthing coach but for people who are dying or choosing their own death. I hold sacred space and facilitate their transition from life into death. Don't say bye! Do not die! Do you think we should call the cops? I think that would kick it up a notch. Jimmy, ahh, man of all hours. I see you met Andy. Andy is doing a write-up on how I'm going to die tonight. Yes, I met Andrew. I have to admit, he's a sprinkle of a surprise that I haven't processed. You know what? I take that back. It's not about me. This is about Jimmy... and his celebration. I'm still trying to process it anyway, I don't know why, just... you know what, I... I'm gonna just release, I'm gonna release it right now. ...to live! Don't say bye! Do not die! Fight! Fight! Fight for your right to live! Don't say bye! Do not die! Fight! Fight! Fight for your right to live! - Don't say bye! - I'm released. Still think we should call the cops? Fight for your right to live! Save your soul, or you'll burn in a hole! Save your soul, or you'll burn in a hole! Trust in the Lord, don't fall on your sword! Trust in the Lord, don't fall on your sword! - Stop, Terry! - Sorry. I'm trying to get their attention! I know, Terry. I know. Just come inside. Oh, okay, sorry. Sorry... hold on. Stick the script... that we practiced, all right? I think they are harmless. How did they even find you? - I invited them. - You what? Oh, my God! You are such a revolutionary. Well, what's a good story without a little conflict? Right, Andy? Fabulous. Now we have to listen to this all day. ...kill thyself! - Is that Carlos? - That's him. Thou shalt not kill thyself! Yo! What's going on, man? What are you guys doing over here? Good afternoon, good sir. We're here on a mission. I don't care what you're on. You're being too loud. Well, we're not here to disturb you. Well, you are... matter of fact, you're disturbing the whole damn neighborhood. Oh, he's getting mad. He's gonna... Honesty is the foundation of a strong community. Whatever, man. Just keep it down. All right? What is that? Looks like a... - Jesus poster. - Oh, no. So what do we do now? It's been my experience, as a man of the cloth, that God will often open a window where you didn't even see a wall. Now, here's a little game I like to play called "Observe and Report." Okay? It's right up your alley, Andrew. Spoiler alert: it's about observing. Yes, yes, we-we walk around... the... the... the bottle. - Backyard. - The-The-The... - Backyard. - It's the backyard. We walk around the backyard. Thank you. Um, and there's no talking, and-and you don't take photos. We just observe and-and listen. Be present, yeah? Now we report. We share our experiences with each other. Andrew, why don't you start? I enjoyed finding the treehouse. I think observing everyone else observe, that was probably my favorite part. Fritti? Bees and... ah, the fruit trees and the vines. I mean, they were so... majestically coiled around one another. That's the perfect metaphor for life. The struggle against oneself, the struggle against one's own human nature. Remy? I listened... and heard dogs barking. Fritti howling. Ice cream trucks, and lots of airplanes. Oh, yes, the symphony of our neighborhood. How about you, Jimmy? I saw... love. Terry... I want to read you something. Fall is no color. Little pebbles in river. Can you see me now? That's beautiful! - What's that from? - It's from me, Terry. I write haikus every Saturday after my bridge game at 6:00 p.m. Of course, you're welcome to join. Oh, that's when I do my pilates. What does it entail? You know, ahh, every doula is different, just like every death is different. But if you have a responsible death, and plan a responsible death, like Jimmy has, then here's how I would help. The arrangement of stuff. I support the transitioner in deciding what happens to their material accumulations they've gathered throughout life. Some of them go to family, some to friends, some to donation. I assist the family with the arrangements and make sure nothing is fought over. I maintain the vision of what the transitioner wanted for themselves. I help curate the space of ascension. It could be classical music accompanied by a porn video or someone who wants to take acid while listening to a presidential speech of choice. - Ask what you can do... - The departure. Being present in the final moments, making sure they don't feel alone as they leave this world. Which is why I tell people, "Embrace your mortal fate "and make your decision now. Otherwise someone will make it for you." Oh, that neighbor's leaving. The one with all the... the art on his head. As always, God performs another miracle. I'd love it if my ashes were, like, intertwined with roots, and I just, like, grow into a tree. I dunno. What about you? How would you want to go out? I'm having a biodegradable uterus made. I want to be stuffed back into it. I want to go out like I came in. James, I know you can hear me! This comes from a place of love. So, for the sake of your soul, James... please listen to the word of God. And may the God of hope... fill you with peace and love and believing, that you may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Spirit. Terry, do you have something you want to say? Uh... yeah. We do not do the things we do because we want to! We are given opportunities to prove that we deserve more chances! God wants us to prove to him that we will not fail, so don't fail! Hey, man! Hey, man. - What did I tell you? - Sir, I understand. We're here trying to save someone. It's your ass that's gonna need saving if you don't get off my block! I already warned you, man. - No. - Excuse me? - I said no. - Man, give me that! Let go! Let go! Please don't! No! This is... This is all part of the Lord's work! - Church property! - No! No! How do you like it? That was my trophy, you asshole! I'd be very scared of Carlos right about now. I'd be scared of Flora. Gosh! Gosh! Golly! Golly! Oh! Oh, dear! - Oh! - Move it! Son of a gun. Who are you texting? I'm just updating my editor. Bet those protesters kicked things up a notch? What's important is representing Jimmy the right way... what he's doing today. Hmm, it's tricky, isn't it? Benefiting from someone's death. What? I'm a paid caretaker. You're here as a journalist. It's... It's hard to find a balance between work and not getting attached. Especially with someone like Jimmy. He's... He is so.... Yeah, I know. Why are you learning Japanese? My next patient is Japanese, so I figured I should start practicing since I'm gonna be with her once Jimmy goes. - That's exemplary. - No, I'm just doing my job. - What does that mean? - "Are you comfortable?" Has anything come up since our last discussion? No, nothing. Okay. And you still want to transition in this room? Oh, yes, yes. Yes to the room. But you know what? I'd like to sit in that chair. That's my favorite chair. Rather than laying down. And... oh, and I'd like you to be on my right side. - Okay... okay. - Yeah. And what about the writer? Do you want him in the room? Do you want him to take pictures? I mean, he brings a whole new energy to all of this. Oh, I'd like him to be a part of it. Absolutely. I'd like him to witness it. But only one picture. His choice, when... when he wants to do it. Okay. You know, there's gonna be a lot of people at this celebration of yours, so I've devised... a method of letting me know when it's time. Okay. Just do this. - Oh... - And that means, "Fritti, meet me in the moon room for final liftoff." That is so appropriate. I love it. Yeah. I went with Jimmy to pick up the prescription. I couldn't believe it when the pharmacist just handed it over like it was nothing. "I'd like milk, bread, and death, please." "Paper or plastic?" It was so menial. I think we all want death to be grander than it really is. When a person prepares to die... there's a weight. All around, it's heavy. Like a big stone. And then they take the tiniest, smallest thing. And they're gone. But that weight... That weight isn't. I just wish it was more balanced. You can put that weight down. That big stone, you don't have to carry it all the time. For someone who's smart, you sounded really dumb. You can't undo what you experience. "Put the weight down." Right on time. How you do anything... is how you do everything. And who would you be if you let all that go? Your grasping, your planning, your self-identification. Everything you carry. Let it all go. So, how will you...

Oh, my God, what... 1956? Who knows? The decades are looser than my dentures. These kids were chasing him after school, and we took pity on him. And one day we decided to get him high after school. He got so high! We was walking past this jazz group that was sitting underneath the marquee - at the Apollo Theater. - Apollo Theater. And he just jumped right in. Started burpin'. Hey, tell him about the 4th of July. You would bring that up. Fourth of July. That was the summer of... Boobs! - She is so fine. - She's all right. All right? Rita's a ten.

Well, it's never too late. Do you think she did it on purpose? - Who? - Rita. Remember Rita? Tell them about the 4th of July. Just say it again. It's okay, yeah.

Yeah, well... giving up on your own flesh and blood isn't godly either. Excuse me? That's your brother. I'm not stupid. I mean, I came here on my day off, and you didn't even have the decency to tell me that we're protesting your own brother. It... this isn't a church call. It's your call. And I bet you didn't even get permission - to use the Jesus van! - Well, I... I didn't wanna tell you because I knew you would do this. You get overly sensitive. Just park. I'm sorry. I ruin everything. I don't have any siblings. But if I did, I don't think I'd protest against them. Well, I do have a sibling, and sometimes you need to do something to get their attention. Let's go back. It's his funeral day. What would Jesus do... if he had a brother? W-W-J-D-I-H-H-A-B. "Wwjdihhab." So Andrew, writing obituaries. Is that what you want to do with your life? It sounds dark. That's a general misconception. How a person died is just one sentence. How a person lived, that's all the rest. And it helps the grieving find closure. That's exactly right. I thought about traveling to nursing homes, maybe helping the elderly write their own obituaries. It just seems kind of m... What's the word? It begins with an "m." So you wanna be the rockstar of nursing... Aloha! I'm here! - Gasp. - We are here. Smashing, Daddy! - I came early. - That's what he said. - Remember Knox? - Hi, Jimmy. Oh, hi.

We met on the bus, remember? - Singing? - I don't remember. We used to perform on buses. You know, like how they do in New York City on the subway? - No one would even look at... - It's right on the tip... - ...giving us life! - ...my tongue. I'm Juana... Juana Bang? I'll be hosting the "FUN-eral" tonight. - "FUN-eral?" - It begins with an "M." Yeah, you know, like "funeral." Mango? Mint? Micro-organism? - Excuse me. - Can we help you? - James? - Why are you here? Because he's Jimmy's brother. Your own family was protesting you? I can ask him to leave if you want. I want to talk with you alone. - I'm fine with dying... - So nice that... Aah! Don't touch me! No, no... - I understand. - It's the volume of... I have a great idea. Let's get ready for your party. - How does that sound? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah, yeah. - Good, let's go, okay? - Okay. Oh, ow... ow. I got you. - Where are we going? - We're going upstairs. Upstairs? With the volumes of my father... Stay... stay. Stay... stay. Stay. No, no, it's the end. Okay. Chop chop, people! We have got a party to conjure. Come on, Knox. Let's go. We've got costumes over here. Let's do it. Does this happen often? I know it's upsetting to see him like this, but he'll be back online soon. Online? Like he's a computer? Why don't we wait in this room? He just needs a little space. Fine. Astronauts say that... moon dust... smells like gun powder. ♪ All the time, all the time ♪ ♪ All the time, all the time ♪ ♪ ...with a big smile, baby, can't believe ♪ ♪ It's really you... ♪ ♪ ...the types of guys you were following ♪ Are you a high priestess? I'm Jimmy's death doula. I'm here to guide his soul into the afterlife using the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Whoa... You ever heard of the Book of the Dead? - No? Bardos? - No. According to the ancient Tibetan Book of the Dead, a person's soul lingers between death and the afterlife for 49 days in these realms called the Bardos. Realms, in which the dead still hear the living. Somebody order a man?! Then I have to help them swerve past all these, like, infinite distractions all over the place so their soul doesn't get sucked down into the... the bowels of the Bardos. Well? I thought it was supposed to be a coffin. It's a throne shaped like a coffin. - It looks like a bookshelf. - Well, I'm not a carpenter. At least one of us is good at crafts. Jesus! And the goal for the dead is the same as the living. Reaching nirvana. I love Nirvana... ooh! - Sorry, girl! - Oh, sorry, um... Also, I noticed this canvas needs a little... Oh! Aah! - Sparkle. - Oh, I don't know - if that will fit. - Don't doubt me. - Arm? Arm. - Okay. - Oh... oh. - Give me a twirl. - Okay. - Oh... beautiful. And look how you shine. - Oh, wow. - My work is done. Off to add more sparkles. Cheer-toodles. Where's your sparkle? - It's right here. - Oh, okay. On the inside. Oh, oh. Do you think Pepper went to hell? - Pepper? - Pepper, our dog. We assisted in her death, remember? Do you think she went to hell? I-I mean, just because it's so odd that we do that for our pets, but we... we don't do it for ourselves. Suicide doesn't end your pain. It merely gives it to someone else. When our mother was sick, she had the courage to face it. Oh, stop trying to save me just because you couldn't save Mom. But you can be saved. She didn't have a choice. My faith prohibits me from standing by and watching you do this. And I don't want to lose my brother for all eternity if I don't have to. I don't want to be a burden. I don't want to be shipped off to one of those warehouses. That's exactly what you'd do if I know you. Yeah, they're called "nursing homes." Oh, yeah. Nursing you to death. - Stop making light of it. - Oh, it is light. My whole body is just a flesh suit, Gordon. It's my thoughts. It's my personality. That's what I live for. If I can't be me and, I mean, everything that that means, I just don't want to be. Any... legal matters we need to discuss? Like with that "Lunatic" thing? It's "Lunartics." Yeah, right. Right. Advanced directive? Your will? Power of attorney? I am your next of kin. Of course, but it's all been taken care of. Remy, my wonderful caregiver, knows exactly what to do. Look, Gordon... all I wanted was for you to be here, and you are. Aloha! Oh, looks like you're having a... little moment here. Okay, listen, I would hate to interrupt, but... I'm gonna. Now listen, I fully support whatever emotional breakthrough is happening here, but, Jimmy, I cannot support you meeting the Angel of Death looking like this. But don't you worry, estranged brother. I can style you too. Here. This is my Puritan hat. Put it on like that. It's from my original production, "Deflower on the Mayflower." Is it too on the nose? I'm going downstairs. Uh...

Well, I used to be afraid of death, until my grandmother passed. I was actually in the room when they pulled the plug. The doctor warned us that, when the body's shutting down, it can make funny sounds. And when all this air was leaving the body, it was, like, yawns and farts. We were all trying not to laugh, just trying to, you know, maintain this air of grieving, because my grandmother, Esperanza, she was so proper. She would have been mortified. But it brought us so much joy. Because it was like she was making a joke of it all. Oh, shit. I got my paint all over you. That's all right. Leave it. It's bait for more.

Would somebody please come up here and start praising me? Wow. You still got those moves, man. God damn! But here's a toast to all the auditions that you never booked. - Salud. - Salud! Hi, everyone. I'm Ricki Lake, and this is my better half, Mama. I happen to be really good friends with Jimmy. We go way back. We actually met on a cruise ship. I first met Jimmy at a space convention in Moscow. He was the keynote speaker. I'm Jimmy's mail lady. I bring him his mail. I met Jimmy at a seafood buffet. Met him at an AIDS fundraiser. Jimmy said he's looking for personal trainer while in Russia, and he's willing to pay me. I lived with Jimmy for a year as his foreign exchange student. Jimmy has been coming to my market for many, many years. Jimmy and I were cellmates. We met Jimmy, um, at an eclipse. - And at totality... - Mm-hmm. ...he was wolf howling. Which got us started in wolf howling as well. We just joined right up with him. The next time I saw him, he was butt naked, writhing around in a pile of oil-soaked, wiggling bodies, which looked a lot like a giant human mac 'n' cheese. I was on my way back to the hotel room when I heard this voice around the corner... and there at the piano, with the lobby pianist, was Jimmy. And I knew... that we would make an EP. If I got in a fight at school, I broke a desk on accident, the teachers would say, "Well, what do you expect? He's huge." We bonded instantly, as we were high on psilocybin. Got into those crab cakes, too. Jimmy taught me that huge boys have to have huge hearts, and I've been using mine ever since. He also taught me about microdosing and the... the art of respecting psychedelics. And he also knitted me this sweater. I was the first American cruise director in Russia, and Ricki was a passenger. Yeah, Jimmy was so fascinating to me, I had to have him on my show. You were on one of the most epic shows we ever did. It was titled "You Have Naked Photos of Me, and I Want Them Back Now." Yeah, and I didn't want to give them back because... - No, you did not. - I used them every night. I can't blame you. He punched somebody in the face for me. He barely knew me. Because of him, I moved to America and started business. I met nice American woman, and I named my child "Uncle Jimmy." - We have to leave early. - Yeah, we can't miss the leaves change. You know how it is, Jimmy. Well, you know how magical Sorenson's Resort is. Something special. And we took you there for your birthday, remember? Mm-hmm. The Hot Chocolate Incident. My mouth has - never recovered. - Oh, man. I'm still not sure why he was there. He was mysterious about it. Something to do with Moonie Babies? People make up all types of things in prison. All of this reminds me of this old Persian poem about human life being like a bird in a beautiful glass cage. And the cage is covered in emeralds and gold and diamonds and silver. He... he... he got me reading Ram Dass. Changed my life. And eventually the cage falls and breaks, and everybody cries about the cage, but nobody thinks about the bird, which is now free, and I admire Jimmy for breaking the cage himself. I've had the privilege to know Jimmy, as we all have. And he's had the privilege to have gotten this far. Many people don't. You're great. Jimmy is great, of course. We're all fucking great. Here's to the space community that never took you serious. - L'Chaim! - L'Chaim! This dance is in honor of all the years you've journeyed and the moments that you've carved into this world "Count Snitz Goes to the Moon"... ♪ Moon ♪ ♪ Don't cuddle me ♪ ♪ I won't miss you ♪ ♪ When you're gone ♪ But I will miss you, Jimmy. ♪ And that's why we say ♪ ♪ Jimmy's all that ♪ ♪ So take a final bow ♪ ♪ Before you go ♪ ♪ We'll miss you, brother ♪ ♪ More than you know ♪ And here's to all the people... who misunderstood you. - Cheers. - Cheers! Do you have any regrets? Actually, I do regret that I never got to finish my memoir. But I've been given the gift of my new friend, Andrew, who will. Andy, come on up here. Yeah, he's shy... give him a hand. Come on, get up here. Come on. My new best friend, Andy. Come on up here. Give him a little encouragement. This is Andrew. He's an excellent writer. He's gonna make me immortal. Do you want to say something? - Oh, no. - Well, that's okay. I have prepared a question for you. What is it like to have Alzheimer's? What is what like? Oh, what is it like to have Alzheimer's, um, what does Alzheimer's feel like? Okay, imagine a filing cabinet. A pristine, organized filing cabinet. Each drawer is filled with your memories. Your first kiss, playing make-believe as a child. Your brother, your mother, your friend, the trips you've taken, songs you've sung. This life. Your life. Then one day, the files are out of order. You're talking about the town you grew up in, but you can't remember the name. Then you do remember, but it's the wrong town. You're confused. You get paranoid. Then for a few days, you're totally fine. Then more files disappear, then a... then a whole drawer gets stuck. You know you are a human in a body, but you don't know who you or any of your loved ones are. That's why I've decided to do this now. Before all the drawers are gone. Before there isn't even a filing cabinet left. I love you all.
