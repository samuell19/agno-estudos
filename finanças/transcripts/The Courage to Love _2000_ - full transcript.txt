[footsteps] (Williams) Before the Civil War, New Orleans was unique in all the world, more French than it was American. Races freely mixed, creating a new class known as Creoles, or free people of color. European men were especially enchanted by the exotic light-skinned women of this class, whose ancestors were the children of master and slave, Spanish and French. Big night tonight. [bell tinkling] (Williams) Parties were thrown at the old Orleans ballroom, where the Europeans would select the young women, pledge support, raise families with them, yet never marry. One such liaison, that between Jean-Baptiste and Pouponne DeLille, produced a daughter whose dreams would change the old Orleans ballroom and her world forever. Au revoir. (children) Au revoir. Bye. Au revoir. Au revoir. [bell pealing] Oh, I'm late. Grandmama gave it to me to wear on my night, for luck. It brought me love. It will bring you the same. Célie. Papa, Maman has to finish my hair. I want you to show me those fancy new steps of yours: a reverse, lightly, hmm? As a bird suddenly flies. So one, two, three. (Cécilia) I will fly like a bird, but I won't have a partner if my hair's a bird's nest. Ah. Ma chèrie. Mm-hmm. [violin music] Ah, chin up, chin up. You don't need to see. You must trust your partner. I like to know where I'm going, Papa. Then you should not waltz. It is the quadrille for you, or...the polka? [laughing] Bonsoir, Jean-Baptiste. Bonsoir, chèrie. Henriette, late, on your sister's night. (Cécilia) She forgets everything else when she's in the classroom. Forgive me, Célie. And will you forget next year, when it is your turn? I certainly hope so. I might not be able to waltz by then, anyway. (Pouponne) Oh, nonsense. Nonsense. You must stop with your grand opinions. It will only upset her. I won't say another word about it. It was so dull without you on Sunday at dinner. Mama didn't eat a thing. Well, I, um... Henriette-- [women giggling] Girl? Betsie. Where is that wine I asked for? Sorry, Mr. Jean. Don't give me excuses, girl. Bring me some wine. Papa, was I doing it so wrong? Maybe you will be ready next year, if you keep your chin up. Left, left. Chin up, chin up. ♪ I know you will have a wonderful time, ma chère. You look beautiful. But you said you would attend with us. I wish I could, but unfortunately, I have important business. Uhh. Bonsoir, mon amour. Bonsoir. But, Papa, I-- Célie, every man there will watch you dance and wish he were your partner. By the way, your bird's nest looks lovely. A bientot. Bonsoir. Hyup.

Pray for love, Henriette. ♪ (man) Amelia, ego to baptizo en nomino patris et filiis et spiritus santci. [baby fussing] Amen. (Cécilia) Amen. [baby crying] (Henriette)Maman, why isn't Papa here? (Pouponne) Obviously, the business at the plantation is taking longer than expected. Well, he said he was gonna be here. Your papa has not stayed with me for 25 years because I insisted that he be here or there. Don't you care? Questions, Henriette, always questions. Ask too many questions, and you will drive your man away. Marie is gonna meet us at the boat. She's bringing school supplies, and Julie and I promised to be there. You'll be very careful? It's dangerous there since the Americans came. Au revoir. Au revoir. [goat bleating] [bells ringing] (man #1) Now, who'll start the bidding at 150? 150, do I hear 150? Yes, sir. Thank you. 200, anyone? 200. (man #2) 200. (man #1) Yes, sir. Thank you very much. 325, 325, do I hear-- (man #3) 325. Papa? Were you addressing me? No, sir. I thought I knew the gentleman you were talking to. Did you, now? Henriette. Henriette. [horse whinnies] (Henriette) I thought I just saw my papa. Bonjour. Bonjour. (Julie) Here's the bread you wanted for Marie. Ma'am. Ma'am. Henriette. Uh, be right there. [poignant music] Would you like some? (man #1) Gimme that! (man #2) Get away! [men shouting] Miss, let me do that for you. No, no. Miss, it ain't seemly. [sighs] (Henriette) In a city like this, the masters do nothing? [men shouting] They just can't work no more. Henriette. (man) Jacques! Get over here! Yes, sir. Don't make me call you twice. Get over there and help Mrs. Morgan with her things. Sorry, ma'am. Let me get those for you. What am I giving Marie now? Oh, she won't go hungry tonight, Julie. Oh, there she is. Marie! Oh. Oh, it's heavy. Excuse me, sir. Would you mind stopping-- [shrieks] [splashing] Mum! Don't worry, ma'am. I'm comin'. [Marie coughing] [all talking] [gasps] Apparently, I missed the delta waters more than I knew. [laughing] Oh, thank you, thank you. So much trouble for such an old maid. Miss, I'd do it again. It's kinda hot out here, anyway. [laughing] Enough of that. It'll go to his head, and I'll get a week of sulking and slow service out of him. Sir, he dove in to save a woman's life, while the rest of you stood by, checking your watch fobs. (man) There are laws against sassing. Better learn that for your own good. [gulls squawking] (man) Jacques. Clean yourself up. I don't want people thinkin' that we dress you like that. Looks like main street in Sodom. How can you make me leave Charleston for this? Look at them paradin' around. Give it time, dear. Things are gonna change. [goat bleats] Well, is anyone else for a swim? Allow me to introduce myself. I am Gerard Gaultier. My parents have just taken up residence in a plantation up near Pontchartrain. Enchantée. I'm Marie Alicot. These are my good friends Julie Gadin and Henriette DeLille. Uh, welcome to New Orleans. Would you do me the honor of allowing me to see you home? We have our own carriage, but thank you. Then at least I can carry your things. Well, well, well. [clears throat] The accent's not from the West Indies. I think he's from France. You can always ask him at the ball next week. I'm not going to the ball. But...it's been arranged. Oh, I saw my father today. Of course, he didn't see me. I don't want that--not for me, not for my children. (Marie) I expect you'll be telling your mother soon. She'll understand. Mm-hmm. Ah, you've imported rocks? [laughing] They're books. We're teachers at the parish school, and Marie's a missionary. Oh, wonderful. This will be difficult to accomplish with dignity. I'm sure you'll be able to manage somehow. Oh, only with your steadfast belief and encouragement, mademoiselle. [clears throat] (Henriette and children) One, two, three, four. (Henriette) Excellent. That's it for today. Au revoir. Merci. (children) Au revoir. Thank you. Au revoir. Au revoir. Merci. Au revoir. Au revoir, merci. [girls chatting] Take your seats. Simone. I'm so glad we found your parish, Father Rousselon. The cathedral seemed-- well, full of foreigners. And we're glad to find you, Mrs. Morgan, and to have your husband-- 'Scuse me. As a warden. (Henriette) D. (girls) D. A catechism class for girls this late? Très bien, Simone. [gasps] Slave children? Mrs. Morgan, slaves are God's children too. We are allowed to teach them at night. Henriette. Bonsoir, Father. (Rousselon) Bonsoir. (girls) Bonsoir, Father. This is our newest student, Simone. Her father will bring her to church on Sunday. That's my Jacques' daughter. I can read, Father. Very good. Well-- Very good. Teaching coloreds to read requires permission. (Henriette) God... is...love. Repeat. (girls) God is love. [laughing] Excellent. Henriette, do you have their permission? You know it's illegal to teach slaves to read without their masters' consent. How can they learn the catechism unless they read it? How can they truly worship if they can't read the Bible? Do the masters know, Henriette? God knows. (Pouponne) Henriette, what is this I have heard? You are teaching slave children? Do you want to hurt your father? Do you realize he does business with their masters? And the sons of those masters will be attending your ball this week. Maman, about the ball-- Do you want them laughing at you behind your back? Do you want them to wash their hands after they've finished dancing with you? [chuckling] (Pouponne) Henriette, I have asked you a question. Papa? [giggles] [whispers fiercely] No. You will not parade your heart. You want these white bastards to see? Unh. Come on, Ree. She'll blame me if you're not ready. I hate this. You know how much I do. Ooh, Maman was right about the green. Do you love him? Who? Oh, Samuel? Yes. He has promised that we will be together until we're old and crotchety. But you can't marry, Célie. What difference does it make if he stays with me? [sighs] God means us to be married till death parts us, to walk across a square openly, as man and wife. Otherwise, we're just being bought. It's--it's like the-- Look, Ree. Think before you speak. [sighs] (Jean-Baptiste) What made you think things would be different with us? [door shuts] (Pouponne) Jean-Baptiste, you made a promise to me. Was I naive to believe in you? And I've kept my word. I help you raise the girls. Cécilia is taken care of, and now Henriette is well-placed too. And me, Jean. Me! I must produce legitimate heirs. You knew that. It is something I must do! You will be ravishing. Every man there will hunger after you, and they will envy your gentleman, Paul Cartier, who has assured me he will provide you with the finest of everything. Did he say for how long? And when I see you in the square tomorrow or the next day, will you see me? You are my beloved children, and you always will be, even if I can't see you again for a long time. I'm getting married. And then you'll leave us. So this is the life you want for me, Maman? I will not go to the ball. I will not meet Paul Cartier. How do you intend to live if you don't go to the ball, my dear? How will we? If you have not understood things, your papa has just ended our lives. Oh, Pouponne, don't be so dramatic. You can keep the slave and lease her out and the house, of course, too, as I promised. Well, at least we won't be begging in the square where you and your wife might see us. (Jean-Baptiste) Pouponne. (Pouponne) Oh, Jean-Baptiste, if this is my house, get out.

Because it just keeps gettin' worse, and all you do is nip at the edges. [children laughing] I'm gonna catch you. Children, children. Come, come. Come. (Henriette) A...B...C... Why are these lay workers wearing habits? They donated their wardrobes to the needy and simply chose to dress in a uniform more practical for their work. The wardens want to put a stop to all of this work. These women are bringing this parish to life. We must refuse. I have... for now. But it's rumored Rome will denounce slavery. Our position is precarious with the Americans. They want the school closed. They want you out. And I see you've started an infirmary. Many of those we help return to mass on Sunday. The church is filling up. With abandoned slaves. What they're doing is so clearly God's work, and we may not be able to protect them. Oh; oh, no, not this one too. You can't give away your ball gown. That one more than any other. No; I'll keep it. You've been speaking with Betsie about freedom. You're giving away all your clothes, and next will be this cottage, and where will that leave me and my children? There is no worry. God will care for us. And Maman? We'll pray for her. Everything Samuel left to the children--our children-- will be given to his white family. Is that how God answers your prayers? After I have this baby, it would seem that I will have to attend a ball because I will need to find someone to take care of us. I hope I look as bewitching as you were when I wear green.

Gonna die here in my arms, and that'll be the end of this. I give up on your God. (Simone) Papa? Is she here? Ask her. I don't want none of this. Baptize my baby before she die. I can't baptize the child. I'll send for Father Rousselon. (woman) But she might die before then. There won't be time. Please, sister. [whispers] Please. Heavenly Father, bless this water with Your Spirit, and make it holy. What name do you give this child? Henriette. (Henriette) Henriette, I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. (Simone) She's safe now. [baby hiccups] (Gerard) The baby has a chance to survive. You did the right thing. (Henriette) There wasn't time to ask for permission, was there? And what if my prayers don't work? No, no, it was right. You changed the world for them tonight. Oh, Gerard, I felt it. I felt it. I really did. You changed the world for me. Do you know how much? You make me feel hope. You make me feel like I can make a difference. Henriette, will you come with me to meet my parents? Yes. Then we can be together forever? [giggles] Yes. [horse whinnies] Oh, vous êtes très belle. Cécilia let me borrow her dress. They are going to love you. Allez. [thunder rolls] [goats bleating, dogs barking] (man) Whoa. Get out of the way! Pardon me? Move! What? [animal noises] (woman) Any other people here? (man) I have some paying customers. Your people are so dedicated to making us feel inferior. Is this our day, then: you poking me with daggers, me hanging my head? If a man insults me, there is no question of what I would do. I would oil my pistols and meet him at Twin Oaks. I know how to be brave for that. But this--it is like walking in a fog. There are no boundaries. The look on their faces-- I wanted to hide from it. Henriette, I do not know how to be brave for this. I love you. I'm sorry. We'll both have to learn. I'll depend on you for strength in it. Perhaps we should spend some time alone before we fight more ghosts. Oh, but I put my dress on, and I did my hair to meet your maman. She's expecting us for dinner. Henriette. I am afraid. You did tell them. And they... They said, um...they would treat you with kindness. Pity. Respect. Respect for you. Their stomachs will turn at the sight of me. Then they'll wash their hands twice before I'm gone. I cannot protect you from that. I don't want to be protected. I want to be free of it. I'm sorry. You don't understand. You can't. Gerard, I do believe you love me. But you can't make me disappear into your world. Henriette, please, no. Let me take you back. Henriette? I didn't recognize you. I used to hear the angels sing. I can't hear them anymore. They're still here. I'll see you at the funeral. What funeral? You haven't heard, then? Heard what? Simone hemorrhaged in the night. She never woke up. [crying] They found her baby sleeping peacefully beside her. I heard what you did. I'm sure it gave her peace. [bell clanging] [woman crying] (Henriette) Is God so wrathful? Suffering on top of suffering, with no lesson, no reason? I don't understand, Father. Bonjour, sister. Bonjour. I've sought; I've prayed. I still do not understand. Bonjour, sister. [whispers] Bonjour. Draw on your faith. We're not meant to grasp everything at once. [man crying] That answer does not satisfy me. I need to know why. I don't understand. He called you "sister." They all do. Haven't you heard them? You've touched them, and so you've become a sister of the Lord. I didn't ask for it. No; you say God hasn't helped the suffering, but He has. He gave them you. But-I-I can't-- Do you remember the night you came to Him? You were abandoned, and yet you knew where to come. You knew the solace it could bring others. What does God want from me? Come on, sister. [knocks once] You cannot give me a second chance? Let's begin at the beginning. Why were you at the ball that night? I was there looking for you, Henriette. To be your concubine? No. I want to be able to believe you always. Then believe me. Because every time I visit my mother and see how she was destroyed because she loved a man from a different world-- I am not your father. I could not abandon you. If I have to choose between you and my world-- my parents, even-- I'd choose you. We can have a real life in France, a real marriage. We can be happy. Happy. [whispering] Yes, ma chère. I will protect you. People will look at us and shake their heads and wish that they'd married for love. [whispering] We will change the world. Here. You don't look very well. Oh, I'm just tired. Perhaps we should delay the departure. No, I'm fine, I'm fine. We'll be fine. You just enjoy whatever time you have together. [sighs] To be loved and to let yourself be loved, to be touched so deeply, Célie. You told me, but how could I know? You might as well take some of these dresses. They don't fit me anymore. [laughing] Uhh. You have nothing to worry about. Gerard has promised to take care of you and Maman. He's gonna help you fight for your inheritance that Samuel wanted you to have. Oh, you're so lucky. You must write to me the moment you set foot in Paris. Write? You'll visit. We expect you at the wedding. Oh, Gerard's gonna complain about my rocks, my books. He's always-- Célie? Célie. [tapping at door] (Gerard) Henriette, look what I have. (Henriette) It's Cecelia. Her fever's very high. They say Creoles don't get it, but she got it. There's an outbreak of yellow fever. It can affect anyone. My medical bag is here. Gerard, I-- I-I know. I'm sorry. Me too. It would be nice to have a conversation between us when one of us does not have to say how sorry we are. [Henriette praying softly] The Lord is with thee. [whispering] Quinine solution is very effective in the-- The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women. Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. [church bells pealing] You gonna pray for me, sister? With all my heart. How is Célie? The fever broke just an hour ago. Ah, the quinine mixture, it was-- I was trying something new. The quinine had little to do with it. But it was the medicine that saved her. How many times have you given medicine to patients and lost them? But without it? Prayer saved her. How can you believe that? Because it's true. [man coughing] Your sister is well. I do not care why. It does not matter why. This is wonderful, and we can begin to plan again. Henriette, do not turn your back on us. Not now. I'm supposed to be here. My work is here. But we can do even more in France. We can work openly, perhaps build a hospital. And you would not be accused of corrupting the slaves. Because there are no slaves. We can heal bodies and spirits. I prayed for the answers, Gerard. I found out what God wants from me. God has been calling me for a long time, and I can't deny it. I feel God is working through me. You said you wanted an ordinary life, a life with me. [whispers] I know. We can't have it. And so now there is nothing for me? Here, we cannot even marry. What do you want from me? Welcome. Thank you, sister. These women are not sisters. You must not call them that. You deceive this parish with those costumes. Thank you, sister. I'm sorry, but this time, you'll have to stop wearing them. Well, what am I to wear? I've given everything away. [sighs] Henriette. [sighs] Do you know what I see when I pray? I see the Virgin Mary, but her skin is brown. The slaves in the gens de couleur need to know that God is their God too, and we can't just tell them. Color needs to be seen with their own eyes. [sighs] God wants black faces working in his church. Henriette, there are forces against you, powerful people who can ruin everything we've accomplished. We need to go slow. Are we intended to be frightened into submission? Marie? You're crying. The bishop has just banished me from the parish. Banished? Yes, I'm being sent upriver to teach wealthy children on a plantation. (Rousselon) The wardens have pointed out that it's become illegal for integrated groups to work together. (Henriette) And you knew about this? The bishop is forced to disband you. So he's decided to play on the side of the masters. They will also close the parish schools, since slave children are being taught with whites. I am next on their list. This has got to stop. [church bells pealing] (Blanc) As I see by your costume, obedience is not a virtue you put much store by. Please, Your Excellence, just hear an idea? There's a house. My friends and I have just enough money to buy it. With donations, there's a building next door that we can fix up and turn into a mother house. You mean to build your own church now, complete with a convent? And we need you to bless the endeavor. As there are no colored religious orders, I would be blessing only an act of your pride. But you've seen their faces, those hungry souls that worship in our church. You cannot say you are not moved. Do you expect the Catholic Church of Louisiana to challenge the state? To start a fire that could sweep away what they've left of their freedom? But the reward would be greater than the risk. Even if I believed you should be nuns, it can take years to receive Rome's consideration, and then the answer could well be no. I cannot see how I can help you. Perhaps you don't need to appear to be helping us. This church serves a changing community. Why, that sounds positively threatenin'. I understand you have moved to block my appointment of Father Rousselon to the cathedral. We will not continue to tolerate interference in church business. I understand you filed a lawsuit against us. Rather extreme reaction. I thought you should know I also am connected with the courts down in the Delta, and I can assure you money will win out in the end. And I can assure you the rape of a child is considered a sin, even in the Delta. There are no secrets in this parish. What about baptizing a half-breed bastard child outside the church? A warden of the church should be above reproach, especially one married to someone as pious as your wife. But, as I said, the church is here to serve the whole community. May I suggest instead we let them build a place of their own? The coloreds? They'll never do it. But we must let them build it. And if they fail, they fail on their own terms, 'cause if they don't, there's no tellin' what trouble they'll cause, Your Excellence. [birds chirping] Maman? You're so thin. I thought you promised me that you would eat. And you... you look like a nun. You should wear more color. Green. It goes so well with your eyes. Oh. Ohh. How we danced at the ball. Your papa never danced with another woman after he waltzed with me. [wailing softly] Ohh. [sobs] [sobbing] (Julie) It's hard to imagine this as a convent. At this rate, it'll take us years to raise enough money to fix it up. We don't have years to waste. To be an effective order, we need a place to live, an infirmary properly equipped, a school. What about your house? Sell my house? The cottage isn't mine to sell. Cecelia needs it to raise a family. My parents worked themselves to death to leave that place to me. Am I now to consider giving all that up? In the name of God. I think your parents would be proud to know their legacy is being used to serve the community. Julie, we need to sever all of our attachments. And Gerard? Were you able to say good-bye so easily? Good-bye? I thought you knew. He's going back to France, Ree, within a month. Thank you. For what? For coming. I wasn't sure you would. I've been offered a post at a hospital in Nice, a teaching hospital, quite experimental. You'll make a wonderful teacher. Henriette, why am I here? Uh, my reason... our church has run out of building funds. Is that all I am to you? I--no-- You might as well have stayed at the ball. I apologize. That was uncalled for. The truth is, I wanted to know whether you still-- I will always love you. My parents have cut me off for refusing to marry the suitable woman they have found. A year ago, I might have, but you changed me. So...now we both work for the poor, alone, apart. Gerard, I'm sorry. Sorry. Is that why God made us twin souls, so we could be so unhappy? Such beautiful hands. Henriette, it's official. The bishop says we can build a church if we can raise the funds.

Well, something will have to be done. Our first service. Giving up my house was worth it. We may not be nuns as yet, but the bishop will have to at the very least recognize our dedication. Um...the bishop has arranged for you to study as novices at St. Michael's. He feels you need experience living in a religious community. So the wardens got us out of their church, and the bishop... He will petition the Vatican upon your completion. In the meantime, he has appointed me to your church. He's a clever man. [chuckles] Our parish is very lucky to have you. I'm only disappointed we're suddenly so far from our goal. Ree, remember Sister Martha, when we were in school? No cross, no crown? We are going to see this through, until the Pope himself invites us to Rome and says, "You must be Sister Julie. I have heard so much about you." [all laughing] [women singing in Latin] What are you doing? Being a nun. Ah, that sense of humor again. Do you see the chapel? I'd say it hasn't been cleaned this week. No, we just finished. I'll return to inspect it... after dinner. Shall we just cut your tongue out and be over with it? Julie, what are we supposed to learn here? How to keep a convent spotless. We could be serving on the outside, teaching. Scrub. Scrub, scrub. Augh! Scrub, scrub, scrub! Would you like some help? (Henriette) Reverend Mother. Jesus washed the feet of his apostles. Mother Superior. (Henriette) Oh, Reverend Mother. I'm sorry. There's something that these flowers at night reminds me of my mother's perfume. Does it make you sad? When I was a novice, I was too proud to admit my previous life still mattered for me. The more I pretended, the worse it felt. I worry that conquering my own pride is impossible. That's what the scrubbing is for: to help you sleep. Did you love someone? I thought so. I try to forget. I try to stop. Why? Do you think because you're becoming a nun, you stop being a woman? You must bring all of yourself to service, through humanity, which will give you compassion for those who most need to be saved. Good night, chère. Good night, Reverend Mother. Father! It's yellow fever. So many are sick. I'm sorry, but the infirmary is closed. Please, Father. The hospitals are full. They're even turning away white folks. Um... run to the St. Michael's convent. Tell Sister Henriette and Julie. Tell them to come fast as they can run. [people moaning] Sister Henriette, the hospital full. Done turn us away. Master Morgan, he's sick bad with fever. He needin' tending. (Henriette) Put him here on the table. I will pay for a bed. Mrs. Morgan, the beds are taken. Your money won't make a difference here. [coughing] (Mrs. Morgan) I can pay for anything you need. Your money can't even buy quinine. Only doctors can get it, and we don't have one here. I'll take care of her. (Julie) There are more coming, white and black. Look at this. We need a miracle. Short of that, you must rest. Marie! [Marie gasps] Henriette. Oh, Marie. [laughing] I heard what's been happening here while I was on the plantation. Marie. [gasps] [Marie gasps] Quinine? Oh, my goodness. Who could've sent you this much quinine? Only a doctor. (Gerard) "My dear Henriette, "you know my wish is "to give you so much more than mere medicine. "Whenever you are in need, "look to your heart, and I will be there. Love, Gerard."

Sister Julie. Uh...Sister Henriette, you'll need funds. Let me look and see what's in the coffers of the diocese. Oh, thank you, Your Excellence. Thank you, my child. No, wait. Let it be. It will give everyone something to think about. Sister. Master's wife freed us this mornin'. She paid the fee for all of us: the entire household and the field slaves. Oh, God bless her. I always dreamt of this day. I figured my first day of freedom, I was gonna sleep till I wake up. Then I was gonna roll over and go back to sleep again. [chuckles] 'Stead, I got my life packed up, and I'm gonna be on a riverboat by sundown, and that feels mighty fine. God bless you. Good-bye, Sister. And thank you for everything. [children shouting] [ringing] (Williams) Henriette's community received a formal religious rule of life, adopted a habit, and pronounced their vows. They bought the old Orleans ballroom and converted it into a sanctuary for education and the needy. Today, they continue to service the poor, the sick, and the illiterate.
