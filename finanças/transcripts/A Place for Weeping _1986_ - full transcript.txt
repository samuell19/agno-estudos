(distant shouting and chanting) (gunshots) (speaking foreign language) White Farmer: Obeth Mandala. Simon Mwabi. Joseph Umdili. Well what are you waiting for? Take it. Please boss, I need more. What? It's not enough, boss. I need more, boss. You better take your food, my boy. Now, get off my land. Clarice? Clarice, you in? Clarice? For what we're about to receive, may the Lord make us truly thankful. Amen. Tokkie? Yeah? They were shooting in the hills today. I know, I heard it. Son: We heard it too, Henry said it was machine guns. Henry talks nonsense. It sounded close. Tokkie: Ah, miles away, up in the hills. Stupid kaffirs. Two tribes can't even live together in peace. Imagine what would happen if they took over the country. I tell you, they're animals. They should send in the army proper and wipe them out of those hills. It still sounded close. Tokkie: Ah, it's your imagination. Why worry when they're killing each other? (metal screeches) What the hell, the bloody chickens! Where are you, bastard? Bastard. That son of a bitch! Stop! Burn, you son of a bitch! You bastard! (door opening) What happened? There's blood all over your shirt. Shit! (scrubbing) Tokkie? Tokkie: Nothing, okay? One of the kaffirs was trying to steal chickens, that's all. It doesn't matter now, go to bed. I'll see you just now, okay? (shouting in foreign language) Hey, what do you think you're doing there? Get back to work. Move, move your boggers men. Get back to work, men. Move! But master, Joseph is dead. Dammit, is that all you can do? Kill each other? Dirty bunch of savages, get back to work, men! But master! Get back to work, now! Leave him. (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) Woman: At least the view is better than your lunch. I'm so close to getting this son of a bitch. And I know, I just know Dave is going to pull me. What are you talking about, it's his top story. Yeah it was, until he got a visit from those two NIS agents. That put the weed up his ass. Yeah, he'll pull me for sure and I know where he will send me. Where? As far as possible. There's faction-fighting out in Weenen. He's been hinting at it. Well what's wrong with it, it's a good story. I'd do it. Yeah great, out in the middle of nowhere. I'll end up with this in-depth analysis showing that the reasons are overcrowding and lack of resources. Woman: And rampant unemployment. Yeah, same old story. People don't care about a bunch of rural blacks slaughtering each other. Washes right over them. It's all just loose ends Seago, there's no way you can prove the guy is a Cuban exile without blowing your own story. Seago: But he is. That's the same hitman that blew up the Reverend and Charlie's house. That is Colonel van Berg in the picture with him. Yeah I know that, look it's stalemate all right? Give it up, finish. Come on Dave, you know I can't do that. Let's expose the mothers. Dave: What do you think this is, the CIA? Ah, don't give me that. Dave: Well I am, I'm taking you off this job before you get yourself killed or something stupid like that. Dave the faction fights are not a story. Listen to you, where's your bloody perspective? You know, you can't see the wood for the trees. Come on, it's a chance to get out into the country. (man speaks in a foreign language) (Seago speaks in a foreign language) Yeah, sometimes. I'm looking for a man called Eagen. He runs the mission station around here somewhere. (man speaks in a foreign language) Excuse me? What do you want there? I would like to speak to him. Do you know where I'll find him? No. Seago: Hello? Eagen: In here. Dammit. Do me a favor will you, come and hold this for me. Seago: Are you Father Eagen? Who are you? I'm Philip Seago, I'm a reporter. Well, now you're a nurse. Come and hold this, I have to get something. Don't let it slip. Eagen: If that wound closes, I'll never find that little bullet again. Jesus Christ. What happened? Bullet wound. All right. I'll take over now. Shouldn't he be in a proper hospital? Good Lord no, too many questions asked. This fellow tried to steal a cow from the Mofosi tribe. So we end up with all this damn faction fighting. And Lord knew what went on in these hills. You mean he doesn't? Not for me he doesn't. Some of them use homemade rifles, bullets shatter on impact... Instead of going straight through. This one is a real bugger. It won't be long. If you don't need me I'll be outside. Right, fine. This is going to hurt. (man groans) So, Seago is it? What's a man with a name like "Seago" doing so far inland? It's just a name. Doesn't mean anything? Pity. Are you a doctor? I'm not qualified if that's what you're asking me. I do my best. Why? Ah these people are going to have enough trouble answering to God without answering to police as well. What do you want Mr. Seago? Your help. To do what? Father Eagen, you're dealing unqualified with a man with a bullet wound in his leg. 16 people have died so far. And the right wring press are squeezing every bit of mileage they can out of the situation, calling it "primitive tribalism". Now that's a lie. You know it and I know it. So? I would like to speak to that man in your surgery. I don't think he's your man. Seago: Who then? Mr. Seago. Journalists aren't welcome here. They just cause trouble. Are you trying to hide something, Father Eagen? No, I'm trying to explain to you that this isn't the city. Here we have no expectations of overnight solutions, we have no editorials and action committees and strikes. Here we have only time. It goes round and round in large circles, like the seasons. In the end it solves everything. Don't get involved, Mr. Seago. I'm just here to write a story, Father Eagen. Good. So you'll help me? Not me. (woman speaking in a foreign language) (man speaks in a foreign language) Sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you. Who are you? I'm Philip Seago, I'm a journalist from Johannesburg. I spoke to Father Eagen this morning. He told me where to find you. I thought you were from the police. Yeah, I know that feeling. Can I give you a lift? Why? Seago: I'd like to ask you a couple of questions. About what? Faction fights. Father Eagen says you move around a lot in the area. Says you know more about it than anyone else. I don't know. I don't know if I can help you. Seago: It's just a few questions, please. I don't mind walking, I'm used to it. But will you take me to the mission station? Sure. Seago: How long have you been working with Father Eagen? Woman: Ever since my father was kicked off the farm. Where he worked for 20 years. Seago: Why was that? Woman: You promise me you won't use it in your story? Seago: Yes, promise. Woman: I used to have a brother. When he was 13, he was already working in the fields. And one day he came home and he was bleeding from a large bump on his head. It stood out like a fist. My father asked him what happened. He said the farmer had hit him with a brick. Broke into two. And my father asked him why. He said that the farmer had said he was cheeky. Anyway I washed his wound. He ate his food, then he went to bed. Never woke up again. I've never cried so much. This place, you know what Weenen means? Place of weeping. It's not called that for nothing. My father laid a charge against the farmer. Nobody had done that before. But he stood his ground. What happened to the farmer? Woman: Nothing. Nothing? Yes, nothing. The farmer said it was a mistake. He said he was sorry. The judge gave him a suspended sentence. (knocking) (speaking in a foreign language) I'm coming back now. Gracie. (speaking in a foreign language) Is there a problem? I'm not quite sure. Anything I can help with? No, I don't think so. I didn't know where it started, what it is but... Look I don't want to get involved in politics but I think, you know, the government is spending far too much on black development and I uh... It's just the reform, you know. Man: Do you think it could be that? Yeah, I think it's trying to get kaffirs into government, I think it has got something to do with that. Van Rensburg what do you think? Tokkie: Well they're spending so much money on this development. It's the uh... Tokkie: People like us, you know. Absolutely. Man: The money is going to all the blacks and the coloreds. Tokkie: And what are they putting into our life? Yeah absolutely, Tokkie. This government... Yeah but there must be something we can do. Tokkie: Nothing, nothing. Yeah, it's not right, I don't know. I've put the life and soul into this land. Man: I would like to know if there's a meeting they're having fixed. Gracie: Mr. van Rensburg? Yeah? Gracie: Please can I speak to you? I've got no work. It's about Joseph. Get out of here. He died on your farm last week. I went to his funeral. Tokkie: It's none of your business, get out of here. Gracie: Did you report it to the police? (shouting) What's that man, get out of here! â™ª (acoustic guitar playing) (laughter and cheering) (horn honks) All of you, everybody, get out here now. All right. I want to know which one of you opened his big mouth. I'm warning you. Somebody better own up. Good. Until that person steps forward there will be no more rations. You hear me? No more! Come on Gracie. Father, he is not giving them any food. He still makes them work 14 hours a day without any food. They will die. Why did you have to go and see him? That was stupid, what did you hope to achieve? He's guilty. We know that, we know that! Then why, I don't understand. Ah, let's go and get the water shall we? In Zulu we have a saying. A thorn is taken out by another thorn. Faction fighting is as basic as that. It's not only between tribes, but even families. Generation after generation. It is passed down without to question it. Ah, it's a way of life. People die without knowing why. They die like flies! You know, once there were 1000 men lined up in the open field. They just stood there in the hot sun shooting at each other. 70 people died for what? To be poor, to be without work? To cultivate the arid land? But that is changing. Why do you say that? When the whites took our land, they didn't leave much behind. If only there was enough land for everyone... The killing would stop! But of course the killing would be worse. Why? Because none are just country boys anymore. People like to think we're a bit backward. It keeps us in our place. It's starting to change. Oh yes, there's a lot things starting to happen. Like what? Small things. A cow is stolen there. A fence is torn down. A field is burned. Farmers still use faction fight as they choose workers. But it's more than that. How much more? A thorn is taken out by another thorn. Yeah I feel sort of like Dennis Hopper in Easy Rider. Keep expecting to be wiped out by some toothless maniac with a shotgun. The priest? No, he's like a weird prophet. Keeps telling me to not get involved but I'm not taking much notice. Hmm... Yeah I'm sure I'll get a story. (door knocking) Just hang on, I think there's someone at the door. Can I come in? Yeah. Thank God the manager didn't see me. Ah, I'll be with you in a second. I'm just talking to someone on the phone. Am I interrupting? Seago: No, no it's fine. Listen, someone's just come to see me, can I phone you later? Yeah. Yeah okay me too. All right. Bye. So, shall I order us a drink? No, are you mad? I'm not allowed to be here. What's the matter? Gracie: I need your help. Me? You remember the other day, when you were at my place? And the man came to the door? You were asking if there was a problem. Yeah. Gracie: There is a problem, another worker has been murdered. What do you want me to do? The farmer has beaten up one of his workers to death. Gracie, I'm a journalist. The police-- Gracie: The police are on his side! Oh God... This man has killed a worker. He is starving the others to death. And I know he will do it again. Please you must help me prove he's guilty. Jesus... What does Eagen say? He says to wait. He says if he's guilty it'll catch up with him. But there is no time. The other workers are starving, you must help me please. Gracie, it is not my business. Father Eagen specifically-- Father Eagan is tired! There's no time to wait for God now. You must help me. Mr. Seago? Mr Seago?! What are you doing down there? I'll come up. Man: I'm coming down. Thank you for coming. Well you did say it was important. Yes it is. Listen, this is strictly off the record. You're not going to quote me. I understand. Why did you agree to see me? Well as the public prosecutor, I think it is my duty to see that you get your facts straight. I mean if there is going to be a scandal... I'd rather not have everybody implicated. Everyone? Seago: I don't remember mentioning a scandal. Well you're not here to write about the birds and the bees, are you? Seago: What can you tell me about a farmer called van Rensburg? Which one? Excuse me? Prosecuter: Oh there are quite a few van Rensburgs in this valley. I uh... I think they call him "Tokkie". What is it that you want to know? Seago: Anything you can tell me. Well he is a good farmer, possibly better than most. He's had a difficult time, same as all the others. But we've had a bit of a rain, hopefully it will be better off now. What about his relationship with his workers? Prosecutor: What do you mean? Well, how does he treat them? What exactly is it that you want to know, Mr. Seago? A man died on his farm a couple of weeks ago. So? Seago: Did you know that? No. Seago: He was beaten to death. You know that's a hell of an allegation you're making. I wouldn't call it an allegation. Tell me what's your involvement in all this? I thought you were here to write about the faction fights. Surely that is much more important, isn't it? How did you know that? It doesn't matter. What is your involvement in this? I mean why are you telling me these things? Is it because you're worried about people? Or are you looking for sensation? You're a public prosecutor. A man has been murdered. Don't you think we should help each other? To prove him guilty? Or are you looking for a scapegoat? Or a sacrifice for your liberal minded readers? Because my friend if you are doing that, you are completely out of your depth. Who told you about these things in any case? That's confidential. Prosecutor: Well so is what I'm telling you. I know, but I promised my source I wouldn't reveal her. Her? Any case Mr. Seago, I'll see what I can do. But I want to warn you. If you're going to continue with this investigation of yours, I suggest that you get your facts straight. Thank you for your help. I'm not helping you. But I'll see you again. Can I help you? Seago: Mrs. van Rensburg? Good afternoon I am Philip Seago. Is your husband in? If you're from the bank you needn't worry. My husband is there right now in fact, he's got the money. No, no, I'm not from the bank. When will he be back? Well it's quite a long way. Seago: Do you mind if I'll wait? Uh, no come in, I was just... Seago: No, no, I don't want to trouble you. If you don't mind I will just have a look around the farm instead. Why, is there something wrong? Seago: No. Oh well, all right. Farmworker: Hey boss, boss! What the hell are you doing on my farm? I uh... Your wife. You've got three minutes. Mr. van Rensburg. Tokkie: I'm serious. You, get back to the house. Now to deal with you. Eagen: You broke your promise to me, Mr. Seago. Seago: The man is a murderer. For Christ's sake. He threatened me with a gun. Think you're going to make things better for them? If we prove he's guilty, yes. And if you do, will that stop it? No use bringing a man to justice if he can not see that he has done something wrong. Seago: What are you telling me? That by bringing a murderer to justice I'm doing more harm than good? Whose side are you on? If he can not understand that he's done something wrong he will do it again and if not him someone else. How do you change that? It's a question of conscience. He would rather die than admit his guilt. Time, Mr. Seago. There is no time. Then God help us all. Do you understand why you have to do this? Because I'm black. That's not what I meant. Well it was just a joke. Listen you know how dangerous he is. Just go in, get the witness, and whatever is in the paper bag and get out. All right? Be careful, okay? (speaking in a foreign language) Seago: What the hell is going on? (speaking in a foreign language) What's going on? (speaking in a foreign language) Man: It's been a long time, Gracie. Gracie: What do you want, Lucky? Your men kidnapped me, they used guns. Lucky: Sometimes it is the only way. Gracie: No, never. Lucky: Still the same old Gracie. Look around yourself Gracie, what do you think? All I see is men with guns. Exactly Gracie, every day we're getting stronger. Gracie: But when they catch you, they'll hang you. Along with your soldiers. Catch me? Catch me? They've been trying that for 10 years Gracie. I know these hills better than any other white man. They can send a 1000 men, they'll never catch me. But why are you always so negative? Because you are making things worse for us. They are beating us harder because of your defiance. Lucky: It's not you Gracie, it's the people, our people back on the farm. While you go on talking and talking and talking and where does it get you, nowhere Gracie! There's little time left for talking, Gracie. Soon we'll have enough guns and the white man will pay. But don't you see? You don't stand a chance. The white man is stronger than you. What good are your guns against their cannons and planes? It's the poor people who suffer and die. (sighs) Yes Gracie. They have cannons. They have planes. But that's all they've got. Our numbers are growing, Gracie. You see the land that I'm standing on? It's my land, it's your land, it's our land Gracie. You and I are fighting the same enemy. Can't you see Gracie, I'm trying to help you! To protect those innocent people Gracie we need guns to stand against guns. I've been doing a lot of work without guns. Lucky: Is that so? Tell me. The farmer who murdered Joseph. I hear you're getting nowhere. Who told you that? Lucky: I know that Gracie. It's not true, I am getting somewhere. How? Through that journalist? He's the worst kind, Gracie. He's an animal who pretends to be your friend. What does he know about you? What does he know about Joseph? What does he know about us? It's too late Gracie. Tell me van Rensburg is guilty, and then he will die. Seago: Mrs. van Rensburg? My husband is just-- Seago: Your husband is not here, we saw his van leave. What are you doing here? There was a man called Joseph. He worked here. Mrs. van Rensburg: Look why don't you just get out of here? My husband is going to be back any minute now. He killed him. Your husband's life is in danger. And you and the children. He must go to the police and make a confession. There are men in the fields. They have guns, I saw them. They'll kill you. Seago: She's telling the truth, please. You must try. Tokkie? Did you kill Joseph? Tokkie: What? That reporter was here today and a black woman. They said... What did you say? Please say it is not true. You're my wife goddammit. (grunting) Kaffir-boetie. (spits) (door knocking) Bloody... (door knocking) Mrs. van Rensburg: Would you like some more coffee? Tokkie, I don't believe her. Yes you do. Don't lie to me. Mrs. van Rensburg: Tokkie, please. Let's just forget it. Daddy, that black woman is on the farm! I'll kill her! Tokkie! Tokkie: Out of my way! Stop it! Stop it! What do you think you're doing! Enough! Just get out of here. Just go! Woman: Gracie! Gracie! Gracie! (woman speaks in a foreign language) Father, we must go to the police. No, not yet. Seago wake up, we need you, come on. Gracie: Father, we've got proof now. I know. I'm not going to the police, not yet. Gracie: And then what? The public prosecutor van der Molen, he's our best chance. Can we come with? Eagen: No, you stay here. Don't go away, either of you. Prosecutor: You know I'm glad that you came to see me first. So what do we do now? You say there's a witness. Yes. Did she actually see van Rensburg do it? Well, she says so. Then we are talking about murder, my friend. Yes. I think you'd better take me to that woman. (car approaching) Eagen: Gracie? Gracie! You're awake. What happened? Seago: What's he doing here? He has come to get Gracie and the witness. He's the public prosecutor. We've met. Where's Gracie? What are you doing? Eagen: Where's Gracie? It's not safe. What? (speaking in foreign language) Tokkie: What's the matter then? Prosecutor: Well what the hell is wrong with you? Why didn't you come to me when there was still time? Tokkie: What for for God's sake? Prosecutor: Well that priest at the mission, Eagen. He wants to lay charges against you. Tokkie: I don't understand, what for? Prosecutor: For murder. Tokkie: He was stealing from me for God's sake. He tried to run away but I caught him. I didn't mean to kill him. I just remember bouncing him, man. He was stealing from me for God's sake! Well what am I supposed to do? Let him run away? Prosecutor: Well why didn't you come to me when you still had time? It wasn't premeditated, I mean we could've done anything man. Tokkie: Does he have proof? Prosecutor: Yes, he's got witnesses, unfortunately. Tokkie: That Gracie woman? Prosecutor: Yes. And another one, now they've gone into hiding. And that is why I'm here. Tokkie: So? Prosecutor: So? She'll come. I know she will. (shouting) van Rensburg! van Rensburg! van Rensburg! Seago: You thought you got rid of the evidence, didn't you? Well you're wrong. I'm alive. I don't know what you're talking about. But I seem to recall telling you before that this is my property. If you're not off in five minutes, I'm going to call the police. You are so goddamn smug. Get off my land. I'll be back. We'll see buddy, we'll see.
