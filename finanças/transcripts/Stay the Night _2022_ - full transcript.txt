- Is now a good time? - Um... I wanted to follow up about the associate position. Right. Take a seat, Grace. I promise I will not let you down. You didn't get it, Grace. Oh. Why? It's a client-facing position. Mentoring, recruiting, dealing with third-party vendors who, let's face it, can sometimes be a pain in the ass. And that's why I applied. I'm ready for those challenges. But you are more reserved, Grace, and sometimes that reserve comes across as, I don't know, a little standoffish? I'm... standoffish? An HR associate requires a particular skillset, someone outgoing, approachable. For the client to open up, you have to also open yourself up. I-I can do that. I just need the opportunity for it. Grace, you are a valuable member of the HR team. I've been here for three years, Claire. I work hard. Market analysis, comps and benefits, I know it like the back of my hand. I know you do, and there is room for you to grow there. I... I don't want to grow there. I want to do those other things. You're not ready for those other things. I can be outgoing. I can be approachable. Just give me the chance and I'll show you! Grace, we're not going to hire you to make that change. You need to make that change first. Shit, I'm late for an off-site. Let's keep talking, okay? A new back-office position opens up in six months. Management. I think you'd be perfect for it. Okay? Okay. Oh, Grace! Oh, hey, Roshan. Hey. Um, I just wanted to say thanks again. You don't have to. I gave you some standard HR advice. You landed that promotion all on your own. I told my dad about it and he... almost hugged me. I think he was proud or something. I'm sure he was. Yeah. Oh, listen, we're going out for drinks tonight to celebrate if you want to come. What? Drinks. With me. You in? Oh. Um... And Samir is coming and some of the IT girls, and I invited Jennifer. Jennifer... Nice. So you'll come? Thanks, Roshan, but I have plans. Have fun. Bye! Next stop, University Avenue, St. Andrew Subway Station. There's no way you could take that guy down. - He's fucking huge! - -I know, what are you talking about? Honestly, the only thing to do is you chip it and you fuckin' go for it 'cause that guy's a monster, man. You're gonna get wrecked. You should be scared. Carter! What's up, coach? We're sendin' you down. Yeah, right. Really? Yeah, there's a car waiting for you. Go back to the hotel. Call your agent. Here's your per diem. No! Carter. Okay, I've been a little off, but I'm good now. No, you're not playing tonight. coach, you know me. This is what I do! -I bounce back every time! Tonight I've been focused-- -Carter. Carter, Carter! Will you shut up? We needed you to work harder. You're a good player. You really are. Maybe you're back with us next season, but... we think this is the best thing for ya. The minors? I gotta go to fucking Syracuse? No, you gotta clear waivers first. Now, maybe it doesn't take the full 24 hours. Maybe another team picks you up, but... yeah, you gotta stay in town for the night. Cool. So I just sit and wait around until someone else decides -the rest of my life? -Look, Carter... I was you once, okay? I know how this feels. Take care, son. Let's talk about Tampa Bay, the team that proved last year it doesn't matter what you do in the regular season as it's a new year in the playoffs. Hey, can you change the station, bud? ...against the Leafs-- - Joni, hey. - Grace! I told you I would clean up the living room, and I will. Just relax already, okay? Doing a pretty good job cleaning up here. I got some leads on a few apartments. One of them is in the East End, which sucks, but I'm trying. I promise I wanna get off your couch more than you do. I talked to Roshan. Oh. Oh! And? Tell me what happened. I think he likes Jennifer now, so... It doesn't matter. They all went out after work to celebrate his promotion. Why didn't you go? I'm not gonna tag along. I'm not... Grace, I love you, but you do this all the time. Just say yes to something for once. I say yes all the time! -Do you? -Yes. What about that cute guy that worked at your food court? He worked at Subway. Okay, um... Charlie's friend. The guy who spent New Year's with us. That guy? He was a total player. Your neighbour, the comedian dude? He has a girlfriend. But not at first. And you totally liked him. No, I just felt like I always had to laugh at his jokes. This is what you do, Grace. You like a guy, and then you get to know him just long enough to not like him anymore so you don't have to date him. Why would I date a guy I don't like? Because no guy is ever good enough for Grace. That's not true. Really? Go talk to that guy over there. -No. -Why not? -Because he's a stranger. -Exactly. You don't know anything about him. For all you know, he could be the love of your life. I doubt it. He has a ponytail. When are you coming home? Uh, in a bit, but I'm going out after. Where? Tunnel. Pass! Of course you pass. You always pass. Look where it's gotten you, in bed by 8:30 every night. Grace! - Mr. Stone, you're back! - Hey, Lisa. Uh, your gear just arrived. Oh, perfect. Just leave it there for now. I think they made a reservation for me. Of course. Let me check. Here we go. Deluxe suite, 10th floor. Oh, that won't be necessary. The team's covered the night. Lisa, what's the nicest suite? Not the biggest, but the nicest. Like, if you were to stay here, which room would you sleep in tonight? The Wellington Suite on 32. The view is stunning. Is it available? Uh... It is! Perfect. Upgrade me to that. Oh, Mr. Stone, I-- First of all, call me "Carter." And second, it's on the team's dime. A drop in the ocean for them, you know? Hi, you've reached Dani Drake at Talent A. Leave me a message. Thanks. Dani, I checked in. Now what? Call me back. Grace? I'm gonna go now. I cleaned the living room. You should come to Tunnel. Thursdays are so much fun. Grace? Okay, bye. Ugh... - Hey. - Grace! -I'm sorry about earlier. -I don't care! You're here! I am so proud of you. You're gonna have so much fun tonight. Now what, drinks? - Oh, he's here! - Who? Marcus. Cute, right? You invited me to your hookup date? No, no, I invited you to find your own! - I can't do this without you! - Joni? Marcus, hi! Here you go. - Ah! - Two waters. So, how come you're not with your team? What? How come you're not with your team? Holy shit, you're Carter Stone. Hey, bud, nice to meet you. Why didn't you play tonight? What happened? You're fucking up my whole hockey pool, man. Hey, I'm just kidding. Here, let me buy you a drink. Yeah, we're good. Asshole! Hi. -What? -I said "Hi." Oh. Hi. You want another? Um... I have a boyfriend. If he knew I was out with you, he'd die. Jealous type? Oh, no, no, no, he's the biggest hockey fan. Right. So I'm gonna go. Are you alright by yourself? - A-OK. - Okay! ♪ If somebody Woulda told me ♪ ♪ they would never Love me ♪ ♪ I wouldn't have Wasted my time ♪ ♪ Oh, all my time, oh ♪ ♪ But I don't get lonely, I don't get lonely ♪ ♪ Roll one up And I don't get lonely ♪ ♪ I don't get lonely, I don't get lonely ♪ ♪ I don't get lonely, Kill that slowly ♪ ♪ I won't mind If you wanna get cozy ♪ ♪ Girl, gonna show me... ♪ Dani. What? Wait, wait! - There you are. - Thank you. Hi! How's it going? Um, it's okay. I got a drink. Awesome. Now, I'll totally stay if you want me to. What do you mean? I'm really liking Marcus. You met him like seven seconds ago. I know. I just feel a connection. I... want to go home with him. -Joni... -It's just... after Charlie, I, I... just really need this tonight... you know? -Go. -Really? Yeah. -Give us two hours. -Okay. And then you can come back. -What?! -He lives with his parents. Joni, you need to find your own place. I know, I know, I know! Go... Have sex. Be happy. I love you. That lip gloss looks great on you, by the way. -Thank you. -Bye! What-- Oh my God. Hi, can we get, um, some shots? Oh my God, I want that drink! Sorry, I just don't know what to do here. Dani, I can't just sit around. Dani, wait! Wait! Fuck! What? Sorry, I'm just having a bad night. Oh. You going back in? No. Yeah, me neither. Um... Do you know if there's another bar around here somewhere? It's downtown. There's bars everywhere. Oh, yeah. I'm not from here, so... I'm not really a bar person, sorry. That's okay. So, where are you heading now? Home. Well... sort of. Thanks. 27 Crawford Street. Have a nice night. Hey, Carter! We need to finish that conversation, my friend. -Where you goin'? -Hey, what the hell? -Drive. -Excuse me! Sorry, I have to get away from that guy. Uh, Dalton Hotel. Sure. Just take my cab. It's fine. It's just around the corner. Whatever. Thanks. It costs £7 to stand on the meridian line. Is this a... Well, I just thought it was quite ironic that you said it was £7 to stand on the line which runs from the north pole to the south pole. I thought, "I could probably go and find a different bit of line to stand on for nothing.'" I probably accidentally stood on it at some point tonight. You probably owe that guy £7. Dalton Hotel. Goodnight. Crawford Street, right? Um... I'll get out here. Are you okay? I, um... I-I dunno. I just can't go home right now. My best friend's having her weekly sexathon on my couch and now I'm homeless for the next two hours. The old sock on the doorknob, huh? I guess I can't stay out here all night. I guess we could grab a drink and-- Sure, let's go in! This is your room? Yeah, they upgraded me. What do you do? -Well, I, uh-- -Never mind. I don't wanna know. What do you want to drink? Um... What's over here? Uh, a bedroom? That view is... Yeah, I know. This okay? Mm-hm. Sure? Yes. A-OK. - Hmm? - Hmm? Oh, no, keep going. Okay. Oh, hold on. You can continue. Um... What should I, um... -Hmm? -Hmm? Uh-huh... It feels good. Okay. Um, it's just I... I've never done this, but it feels-- what should I... What? Hmm? What? What did you say? It feels good? Before that. I've never done this. Define "this." This. I've never done this. You've never had sex? Um... I-I have to go! Wait... Um... Sorry, uh-- No, wait. Did...? Hey! Wait! Are you okay? This night has been one humiliation after another. I don't even know where I'm going. Want to go home? I'll take you home. Home! I can't even go home. I just want this night to end. Let's go grab a drink. Alright? I mean, I'm sure there's... somewhere around here we could go. I'm not from here so I don't know, but... I could use a drink too. Okay. Yeah? Okay? Um... That way? I'm Carter, by the way. Grace. You think they still have food? It says the kitchen's closed. What can I get you? Uh, a house red? I'll have a pilsner. You still have food? Sorry, kitchen just closed. Ah, no one needs to cook anything. Just chips, crackers? We're both kind of having a rough night. Let me see what I can do. Beautiful. Thanks, man. So, Grace... What do you do? I'm an HR adviser. Hm. What do you do? Sales. Where are you from? Here. You? Montreal, originally. How have you never had sex? Shh, tell the whole bar, why don't you? Sorry, this is all I have left. -Good for you, Grace? -Sure! - Thanks, man. - Yeah. I don't want to talk about it. Okay. We're not talking about it. You wouldn't understand. Try me. I honestly want to know. Would you say most people have... eaten a hamburger? Yeah...? Some people eat one a week. Some have two a week. Exactly, and some have never had one, and that's me. So is it, like... a religious thing? Like you don't eat beef? No, I eat beef. Maybe you're more of a salad person. You prefer, you know... salads? No. I want a burger, I've just never had... the full burger. I just think you need to do it and get it over with. What do you think I was trying to do ten minutes ago? Obviously, I can't have just any burger. Maybe the first one needs to be-- It doesn't need to be anything. Huh! I don't want my first burger to be some... mini slider like the last thing from the kitchen. Yeah, okay. And I'm not having some greasy drive-through one after a drunken night at the club. Those can sometimes be pretty great. Not for my first. I don't know, maybe I've waited too long and now it's too late to find the right burger. How old are you? I'm 27. - Grace, you need to have sex. - -Why? Who made the rule that you have to do it before 27? Just because everyone else does it doesn't mean we all have to. You're right. It's cool you're okay with it. Well, I'm not okay with it. High school? I went to an all-girls school. University? It was more trouble than it was worth back then. How? In first year, my roommate, she would get into all these flings. So much drama. I swear, I spent half the year in the library when she was having sex, and the other half being her therapist the next morning. Well, she's probably married with seven kids by now. No, she's having sex on my couch. Oh. Really, though? Nothing all through university? Between classes and taking care of Joni, it was a full-time job. Okay, but that was what, six, seven years ago? Nothing since then? Not one guy? I've dated, Carter, it's just-- Just what? I'm an only child. I'm reserved. It takes longer. Come on. Guys don't like me. Of course they do. No, I'm not the girl who gets picked up at the bar. Meet someone somewhere else then. But I don't. It never happens for me. Maybe you're too picky. - So I lower my standards? -No. But what are your standards? Can any guy even reach them? I'm not gonna settle for just any guy. Hmm. What? I don't know, maybe... Maybe you think you're better than everyone? Maybe that's why you've never had sex. What do you do again? Sales. So, tonight has been... Weird. I was going to say "unexpected." Yeah. I mean, that's what I meant. Well, I'm that way. Oh... Bye, Carter. Bye, Grace. Thanks for the drinks. Sure. Hey! Are you still hungry? How much older do I look? -30? -30? You think I look 30? It's a compliment. Not when you're 25, it isn't. Pssh! At least people don't think you're a teenager. When I wear a hoodie and jeans, I look like a high school student. Oh, so that's why you dress like you're 40? I work in an office. I need to look professional. Yeah, I bet you fold up your clothes in neat little piles at night before you go to bed too. Well, clearly, you fling yours across the room and step on them the next morning. My stuff's crammed into a carry-on all day. What's the point? Hotels have irons. No. Who irons a hoodie? What exactly do you sell? Sports equipment. Helmets, shoulder pads, wrist guards, mouthpieces, jockstraps. - Sweat-absorbent pants are great. - -Okay, okay! - They're revolutionary. - Sorry I asked. And look, we're here. Great, I hate walking. I told you, guys don't like me. - Thank you. - Thanks. No, I think we determined that you don't like guys. I like guys. It just rarely happens. Okay, how about the first guy you liked, ever? Can you remember that? It's dumb. -I don't think he counts. -Yes, he does. Tell me. What happened? I was, um, I dunno, 14, on the bus. Not a school bus, just a regular bus. Wearing your school uniform? Yes. And I was sitting at the back reading a book. Jane Austen? Can I tell my own story here? Sorry, go ahead. So, the bus stops and all these boys get on, teenagers my age, and of course they head to the back. I keep my eyes on my book, but I can hear them all. Um, then this one boy, he sits next to me. And you know when you sit next to someone on the bus and your arms touch, like here to here? Yeah. That's what happened to us. Our arms touched. And usually you move away, you know? But we didn't. We just sat there, side by side, close. Then what? Then the bus stops and... they all get off, including the boy. What do you mean? What'd you do? Nothing. I didn't talk to him. I didn't even look at him. Not once? Not even when he got off the bus? No, I just... I didn't. I don't know why. Grace, what the fuck? I know! Why did I do that? Yeah, the first thing you should do is make eye contact. I mean, if he said something to me I would have looked at him. No, you could have said something. What was I going to say? Anything! "Hi, hello, I like you." He would have looked at me like I was crazy. But you liked him? I mean, I... I... No, I don't know. Okay... Some guy sat next to you on the bus. Yeah. And you felt something? Did you or didn't you? I was 14. I don't... -I did. -Mm-hm. I felt something. I bet he liked you too. -I think he did. -Mm-hm. It's funny, I always thought that was a nice story. Pfft, but it really isn't! It's actually kinda sad. If you would have just looked at him and said something, who knows what could have happened. Where is this place? You're so impatient. Well, you've tricked me into doing more walking. -Oh, we're close! -I see your ways. It's a yellow door with bars on it. With bars on it? Where are you taking me? You'll like it. I haven't been in a while, but you'll like it. Okay, well, it's cold. This isn't cold. You're from Montreal. Well, I haven't lived there in years. Where do you live now? Down south. Down south, like South Carolina? Eh, more south. South... Dakota? Mm-mm. -South... Asia? -Uh-uh. South America? South Africa? -South-- Korea! -Ha! What? Um. Somewhere in between all that. South Sudan? Florida. Oh! -What's that like? -Mm, it's humid. -Hmm! -Uh, Mickey Mouse. -Retirement homes. -Yes. Uh, alligators. Oranges. -Palm trees, beaches. -Miami. Yeah, all that. All that stuff. So, is Florida a big sports equipment hub type of place? Oh, is that it, "Replies"? ♪ There is no end ♪ ♪ To this story ♪ ♪ No final blow ♪ ♪ Or glory ♪ ♪ Love came here ♪ ♪ And never left ♪ ♪ Now that my heart ♪ ♪ Is open ♪ ♪ It can't be closed ♪ ♪ Or broken ♪ Why do you like sitting at the bar? It's comfortable, casual, easier to get close to a girl when I'm out. Original. I'm at a bar. Where else would I sit? At a table. The chairs are more comfortable. My feet touch the ground. You can talk and have an actual conversation about something real. What? It's too loud at the bar. I don't want to have to compete with the music and the people. Well, that's when you get closer. You can lean in, whisper in her ear, smell her perfume. I could read her body language better when I'm at the bar. So it's all about you? No. I like the table. You can look someone in the eye. Hmm, but there's a physical barrier between us. When we sit across from each other, I feel like I'm in an interview. At the bar, I have to keep turning my head. It's annoying. Okay, what's going on? You tell me. Okay. You win. The table is better. "Carter Stone is a professional hockey player. He plays centre for Tampa Bay." That's you, right? You're not in sales. I told you the biggest secret of my life and you couldn't tell me you're a hockey player? What-- Carter! Seriously, Carter! I don't care if you're a hockey player. Good, 'cause I'm not. I don't understand. Hey, Carter! I was sent down today, okay? Okay! Tampa dropped me. I'm on waivers, and if another team doesn't pick me up in the next 12 hours, tomorrow I get on a plane to Syracuse. Fuck Syracuse! I can't play in the minors. Why not? Is that bad? Grace, I was fired. Technically, it sounds like you were demoted. But I... I understand. There's nothing I can do. Let's go. Where? Just come on. Come on! The rink's closing in 15 minutes. Please return your rentals to the front desk. Rentals to the front desk. Come on, Carter. - Hurry up! - This is stupid. So what you do is stupid? What I do isn't figure skating in the middle of the night. Yeah, figure skating is ten times more entertaining than hockey. Really? A bunch of dudes trying to get a piece of rubber into a net? What's the big deal? You're gonna hurt yourself. Are you coming or not? Not. Whoa, whoa... Ah! Do you even know how to skate? Whoa, oh my God. Whoa... -Grace? -Whoa, oh my God. Whoa! Gotcha. Bye. Oh, you're like the only guy who doesn't want to talk about hockey. Everywhere else, men won't shut up about it, but you... Come on, tell me. What's the big deal? I wanna know. I have not been on a rink like this in a long time. How'd you get into it? My dad. He loved hockey. Mom didn't tell me much about him, she just told me that. He loved hockey. You didn't know him? He left when I was two. When I was a kid, I thought, "Maybe if I play and get really good and make it to the pros, maybe he sees me, maybe..." You know, "Maybe I meet him." Did you? Nope. Don't move. -What? -Don't move! Why? What-- Show-off. You didn't answer my question. What the big deal about hockey is? I dunno. I just love it. I'm an HR adviser. I can help you. I think this is beyond the scope of HR. You don't know HR. Grace, I hate to break this to you but, uh, no one knows HR. - Come here! - Carter, no! No! Carter! Oh my God! Carter, Carter! Carter! You're saying to drop you? No! Fancy. Don't touch anything. I'm just over here. Let me get you a chair. We can start with a DISC assessment. Myers-Briggs is ideal but too long. DISC is short but reliable. We just need to-- Get out of there! Look at this view! No, you can't be in there! - Why not? - -That's my boss's office. Oh, he's not here. She. She's not here, either. Oh-- You can't sit there! Well, I just did. Do you want me to help you or not? Yeah, help me. What's in here? Uh, hello. Ugh! Okay, get off! What? Try it. You know you want to. - Interesting. - What? Your position sounds like it has very dominant qualities, but according to this assessment your behavioural tendencies lean more towards private analytical traits. Accuracy is your strength. Meaning...? Are you sure you're supposed to play centre? Yes, I'm supposed to play centre. I've always played centre. Okay, I'm just interpreting the results. Okay, well, let's interpret something else. Let's go back to your options. What are they? One, you get picked by another team and stay in the NHL or, two, you get sent down for the minors and play for Syracuse. Now, both options have their advantages-- There's a third option. Oh, okay, great. What is it? I quit. You'd quit? You asked for all the options. That's an option. No, you're right. Three, quit. So what's your least desirable option, the one you absolutely do not want to do? I think it's pretty obvious. Right, number two, Syracuse. Let's talk about it in general terms. I really don't want to. What does going to Syracuse entail? Less money? Less prestige? Less high-level play? Less everything. Oh, I forgot something. Why do you think you're being sent down in the first place? Because they think I suck. Do you? -Carter. -Grace. I guess maybe I'm not working hard enough. Why? We travel a lot. It's stressful. Can't always stay focused. But everyone's travelling. Not all players get sent down. And you're taken care of. I mean, how stressful is it to stay in five-star hotels and fly private jets? You don't even have a family. You have none of those stresses. I thought this was supposed to make me feel better. Why... Why has your game deteriorated? Pressure. Where is the pressure coming from? -Everyone. -Name them, who? My coach, my team, the fans. I don't know. Your dad? I don't even know my dad. But he's the reason you started playing, right? You feel like you have to live up to his expectations? That's pressure. You play and he doesn't show up, so you play harder. You keep going. You make it to the NHL, but where is he? Nowhere. No matter how good you are, he never shows up, you'll never meet him. That's why I stopped trying. Yeah. I don't know. You did something so few people do. You found something you love and played it to the highest level. Do you know how many people dream of doing a tenth of that? But, Carter, you did. You went all the way, and all you have to do is do it again, but don't do it for anyone else. Do it for yourself. This suits you. What? This. Here. You. It suits you. I should put this back. -Whoa. -What? A message from my agent. Chicago is circling. That good? Yeah, it means they might want me. I'll know in a few hours. -That's great. -Yeah. Okay, can we get out of here now? Yeah, Joni's sexathon must be over by now. - Roshan! - Grace! What are you-- what are you doing here? Uh, last call's over, the office was closed, -so we thought... -Work party! Um, you guys can't party here. Roshan, you know that. There's nowhere else for us to go. I have a hotel room. Full bar. - Everything's paid for. - Yes! Yes! Roshan? I'd... be into that idea. Ooh! - Yeah, no, let's go! - Yeah, yeah! Holy shit, you're Carter Stone! Oh my God, look at this place! - Yes. - It's so fancy! Yeah, it's nice, it's nice. It's very nice. This is beautiful. I can't believe you! What? You like him. Who? Stop fighting it. He likes you too. Oh my God. Oh my God, there's karaoke mics! - No way! - -There's karaoke mics. Everyone is doing karaoke. Everyone. - Okay, okay. - You, you, everyone! - All been told. - Pick one. What should I do?

You ask him. Carter, I need step-by-step instructions here. Well, you didn't need 'em with me. Yeah, and look how that turned out! Um, take him to the bedroom. Show him the view. But it's the same view as out here. Ohh! I get it. Then what? You kiss him. I can't do that! Isn't that what you want? I want him to kiss me. You gotta give him something, Grace. I have lip gloss. Perfect. How do I look? Great. I want to show you something. It's just in here. Uh... look. You can see our office from here. Yeah? Count from that tower, five floors up and three over. That's you, right? Yeah! Yeah, it is. So, uh... you and Carter Stone...? We're just... I don't know what we are. I literally met him a few hours ago. Oh, so you two aren't...? No! We're not, no.

There's a million guys out there. Not for me. I never like anyone! Why did you bring them all here? I thought it'd be a great-- It's so easy for people like you, Joni, Jennifer.

It's 3 in the morning! - It's me. - Who? It's Carter. Let me in! No. Grace, it's freezing! What! I think I woke your neighbours up. Shh! Sorry. How'd you know where I live? The first cab we took. You told the driver your address. -You remembered that? -Yeah. Well, 27 is, like, Niedermayer's number and, uh, Crawford, like Corey Crawford. -He was goalie for Chicago. -Never mind. Messy. Didn't expect that. What do you want? Just wanted to make sure you were okay. I'm okay. What's over here? Bedroom. Huh, this is what I expected. Jane Austen. I knew it. You have a view. Not as good as yours. Morning. Did you sleep well? For the 45 minutes that I did sleep, it was great. Um... Do you want some... breakfast? For a second, I almost forgot. Chicago? No, L.A. Oh. Is that good? It's great. Well, that's settled. I have to get to work. And you have to be in L.A. in...? Tonight. My flight's in a few hours. Pearson? Yeah, but I have to stop at my hotel first, get my stuff. What time do you start? Soon. I usually like to get to work early. Of course you do. Come on, I gotta go. You can't have eggs without bacon. Cereal it is. Grace, uh, Marcus was just leaving. I was? It's okay. Coffee? Sure. I-I'm gonna clean all this up once he-- It's fine. Look, Grace, I'm sorry that I left you last night, but we don't have to do this whole passive-aggressive thing this morn-- Morning. Uh, who are you? Coffee? -Thanks. -Yeah. Grace, aren't you gonna introduce us to your friend? Holy shit, you're Carter Stone! You know him? - He plays for Tampa. - Actually, L.A. now. - Yeah. - Really? -Mm-hm! -When'd that happen? Uh, I'm confused. Grace, I have to go. My car is waiting. Oh, okay. Yeah! Bye, Carter. Bye, Grace. Huh! I can't believe it. You did it! It's nothing. Grace, did you see the way he looked at you? -What? -He's into you. -Really into you! -Ah! He looks at everyone like that. I don't think he does. He's going to L.A. So? So, it was just a one-time thing. Grace, you're just gonna let him go? I'm gonna be late for work. Ugh, that's it? I'll tell you everything later. Right now, I really have to go.
