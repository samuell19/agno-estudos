[BATS FLAPPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMING] [WHIPS LASHING] Here before you suffer the shades of the landlords and bankers. Mark it well! [SCREAMING] As they feast upon the labors of others in life through the collection of interest, so are they feasted upon here in death. Tomorrow, you will be set loose upon them. You will be judged according to your zeal and imagination. Hear me, teacher. What is it now, Veronica? More of your adolescent fantasies? I have had the same dream again. I saw a roof of blue with a golden orb high atop it. It was beautiful. You know the law. You know it is forbidden for us to leave this pit! Won't you ever learn, Veronica? Our elders are incapable of understanding. Well, you know how sensitive the elders are, ever since the fall. VERONICA: The fall was because of their own faithlessness. Why should we be made to pay for their disloyalty? I can't give you any answers. I only know you risk terrible punishment just speaking of it. I would happily pay the consequences for a single day of freedom. My uncle showed me a crevice by the river of the tyrants once. He swore it led to the world outside, the world of mortals. Show me. MARY: There it is. I can't believe it's unguarded. MARY: Why would it be? The traditional way for our people to visit the world above is through demonic possession. It is only you who would make the ascent, wearing your own flesh. Would you come with me, Mary? I'm afraid. I am not like you, Veronica. [GROANING] Sack of liars! [ANGUISHED GROANING] VERONICA: [INAUDIBLE] father. Your teacher left here moments ago. You are continuing to persist with your seditious nonsense about the world above? I want to walk under the golden orb that I have dreamed of. Within sight of the Almighty. You speak blasphemy! Repent at once, child! I want another life, father. Veronica, your father doesn't hate you. You didn't see his eyes, mother. He means to dismember me like those other disgusting religious schismatics. Where's my salt? Now I know you'll find this hard to believe, but your father and I were young once, too. It's hard to visualize. Of course, we're a different generation. Child, you've got to apologize to your father. And-- and promise him you'll-- you'll give up these crazy ideas of yours. Otherwise, he-- he may feel it's his duty to destroy you. Hello, dear. You're just in time for supper. Thank you, oh Lord, for this bountiful meal and for letting us serve you as best we can. Amen. ALL: Amen. [SPITS] Hellikin, dear, Veronica has something to tell you. Go on, Veronica. Veronica. Veronica. Don't be willful, child! Apologize to your father! I'll teach you what it means to scoff at the law! THERESA: No, Hellikin! Please, I beg of you. We can always have more children, Theresa. Now step aside! Run, child! Run as fast as you can! Damn you, child! [MUSIC PLAYING] NURSE 1: All right, let's move it! Move it! Bring him in there. Make sure he [INAUDIBLE]. NURSE 2: Coming through. [INAUDIBLE] What's the story here? Guy tried to pay for his groceries with a gun. Little old lady gave him change with a 38. Nurse, get me pressure bandages and hang be a large bore IV. We need access now. NURSE 1: All right. NURSE 2: Got another one. Got another one. [INAUDIBLE] - [INAUDIBLE] over here. - Come on. Come on. - Oh we've got a bleeder here. - All right. - Fucking bitch! I'll kill you! NURSE 3: All right. That's good. Start-- pump it in. Pump it in. We're losing her. DOCTOR 1: Do you have a pulse there? DOCTOR 2: Yeah. Keep-- yeah. Doctor. DOCTOR 2: Get some readings. NURSE 4: That's it. [INAUDIBLE] NURSE 5: Get some epinephrine. NURSE 4: All right. She's in V-tach. - [INAUDIBLE] - Let's clear this path. Let's get him prepped for surgery. Get him out of here now. NURSE 6: Now. Now! - Bitch! DOCTOR 3: Coming through. [FLATLINING] She's gone. Surgery 1, Doctor. [FLATLINING] Nice work, Max. I really didn't think he'd make it. This world is going to hell. [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC] [CAR ENGINE REVVING] [HONKING] [CAR SWERVING] (GASPING) I want x-rays, an MRI, and blood gases. Pressure's OK. We may be looking at a subdural here, so let's get her prepped just in case. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] We'll take her to x-ray 3. [SNORING] What the hell is going on in here? It's freezing. I know, Doctor. Believe me. We've moved her twice. And each time, the heat's broken down on us. We've got a lot of blankets on her now. It just doesn't make any sense. This is getting weird. If you think that's weird, look at this. Those are the biggest feet I've ever seen on a female in my life. Miss? Miss, can you hear me? I don't want to alarm you, but you're in a hospital. You've been in an accident. Where is my beast? What, you mean your dog? He's fine. Don't worry. I want him here with me. He's being watched at the pound. Um, Miss, I really don't think that's a good idea. (BREATHING DEEPLY) Hmm, nice. Who are you? I'm your doctor. What sort of doctor? Are you a priest? Hardly. I'll tell you what. You get back into bed, and I'll check on your dog. So, what's your dog's name? Hellraiser. That's charming. Can I get you something to help you sleep? No, thank you. [SNORING] [SNAPPING FINGERS] [SNORING] [VOICES YELLING] [VOICES YELLING IN ONE EAR] [VOICES YELLING IN BOTH EARS] [SNORING] What do you mean he's gone? All right, fine. No, I don't know who's going to be paying for the damage. Look, why don't we talk about this another time, OK? All right. Bye-bye. WOMAN (OVER THE PA): Dr. Davis, telephone please. Dr. Davis, telephone please. Hello, Max. How did you know my name? I must have heard it spoken. Listen, I have some bad news for you. I just spoke with a pound, and it seems as though your dog has escaped. The morning is so beautiful, Max. So much is going on here. Miss, maybe you didn't hear me. But I said that your dog has escaped. My beast is fine. See for yourself. [HELLRAISER BARKING] He's so well-behaved. His heart is pure. Like yours, Max. The staff put together some clothes that you might be able to wear. And I got some shoes that I think might fit. Thank you. They say I'm to be released. Who said that? A slave. A slave? Excuse me for a minute. [CHURCH BELLS RINGING] WOMAN (OVER THE PA): Dr. Barris, dial 112 please. Dr. Barris, please dial 112. DOCTOR: Listen, Max. The girl's an indigent. You can't find anything wrong with her. We have to release her. I'm not happy about throwing her back out on the streets. I think a few more days here are imperative for a healthy recovery. And Doctor, besides-- These are patients, Max. They aren't puppies. We can't take them home with us. You know better than to get personally involved. [BOTTLES SHAKING] I want you to accept me into your dwelling. Veronica, where's your family? Don't you have a home? [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC] (TELEPATHICALLY) I'm asking you to accept me into your dwelling. You know, that's an excellent idea. I'll take you back to my place after I finish my shift. Bless your mortal soul, Max. I'll see you later. [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC] [HELLRAISER BARKING] Huh. How on earth-- The dog even knows what apartment I'm in. MALE NEIGHBOR: [INAUDIBLE] baby in here! FEMALE NEIGHBOR: Hey, I don't care [INAUDIBLE].. MALE NEIGHBOR: [INAUDIBLE] No wonder I got [INAUDIBLE].. FEMALE NEIGHBOR: [INAUDIBLE] [OBJECT BREAKING] [BABY CRYING] [INDISTINCT YELLING] Just ignore those two. They're always at each other's throats. The man's an adulterer. You got that right. [BABY CRYING] [INDISTINCT YELLING] Well, this is it. Can I get you anything? Are you hungry? I have no needs at this time, Max. Well, please forgive me, but I'm on call tonight. So I better try and get some sleep. But if you need anything, you just holler, OK? Otherwise, make yourself at home. Oh. Welcome, Hellraiser. Sleep well, Max. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [STATIC] MAN (ON TV): By any means necessary. At this point, I question the whole purpose-- (ON TV) Armed with law books and with guns, the Black Panthers monitored the actions of the police. Black-- black-- (ON TV) Those big welfare payments are just an excuse for these women to go on having more babies. And I think people are tired of providing for that kind of promiscuous behavior. Therefore, I'm asking the city council to withdraw funding from the Home for Indigent Women. And I think I've got the votes. REPORTER 1 (ON TV): This move will put a lot of single-parent families on the streets. (ON TV) Yes. But in a budget crisis, everyone's got to suffer equally. REPORTER 2 (ON TV): In local news today, six more bodies have been unearthed at the home of Richard Warren, bringing the overall body count of this murderer to 69. REPORTER 3 (ON TV): It has been reported by reliable sources that the refugees are engaged in widespread acts of cannibalism. REPORTER 4 (ON TV): If it's a murder or not, nobody seems to know. MAN 2 (ON TV): Wait a minute. Now, wait a minute. MAN 3 (ON TV): Wait in the office. MAN 2 (ON TV): Wait a minute! Am I under arrest? Am I under arrest? Am I under arrest? MAN 4 (ON TV): [INAUDIBLE] place him under arrest. MAN 2 (ON TV): Am I under arrest? (ON TV) I have always stood squarely for racial harmony. But I don't go with foreclosures. Welfare queens and socialists, that's what we're protecting you from. [UPBEAT MUSIC] [STATIC] MAN 5 (ON TV): [INAUDIBLE] MAYOR (ON TV): As mayor of this city, I am dedicated to the purity of our cultural heritage. [PHONE RINGING] We can't allow our cultural identity to be diluted. And as far as the pro-choice issue, I don't see why negligence and promiscuity should be [INAUDIBLE]. The city council needs to consider the proposal for welfare reform at its next session. [WHISTLING] These matters [INAUDIBLE]. It is of the utmost importance that our streets be cleared of indigent and wayward immigrants. We cannot fund the hopes and dreams of the entire Third World. Hey. MAYOR (ON TV): It is our inalienable right and good fortune-- What's the matter? MAYOR (ON TV): --that we should have been born in a land so rich-- Come on, now. What's wrong? MAYOR (ON TV): --with opportunity. REPORTER 5 (ON TV): That was Mayor Wharton-- Oh, Max. REPORTER 5 (ON TV): --live from the steps of City Hall. Back in a moment-- I knew there was evil in this world, but I never realized how much. REPORTER 6 (ON TV): Are children really being sacrificed in satanic rituals throughout rural America? We'll be speaking to a panel of moms who say they've done it themselves. [WHISTLING] Why are you listening to this garbage? It's not in my nature to turn away from evil, Max. What do you mean? To turn away from evil is to be an accomplice to evil. Now, what about that Mayor? The mayor? I don't know, what about him? He is evil incarnate. How is it permitted that such a man is able to rule? The people of this city voted him in, including myself. Anyway, I've got a short shift tonight. I left you a key and some money. So if your dog gets hungry, you can go down to the corner store and pick him up some food. OK? I'll call you later. Bless you, Max. POLICE OFFICER 1: Come on. Come on. POLICE OFFICER 2: Let's go. - All right. Stick to your own [INAUDIBLE]. [INAUDIBLE] [POLICE SIRENS] NUN: Excuse me. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] I abase myself. That's not necessary with us, dear. Come up here, dear. Are you a runaway child? I have left home, yes. Do you need a place to stay? Or perhaps, you'd like a nice sandwich? You know, we offer temporary lodging in our church for young people who have lost their way. You'd be more than welcome to drop by. In a church? I couldn't possibly. Why not, dear? I would surely combust. Then, take this, child. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [SIZZLING] [GASPING] Why would you hurt me this way? I have always served the Lord well. (GASPING) Oh. Miss. [UPBEAT MUSIC] WOMAN 2: No! No! No! - Shut up! No! Come here, you. No! MAN 6: Shut up. WOMAN 2: No, no! No! MAN 7: Get by me. No! MAN 6: I'll hold her. No! Hey! No! No! Hold still! WOMAN 2: No! No. No! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Ah! Hey. There's only 20 bucks in here. We've got company. No! No! No! No! Come on. No! Join the party. [YELLING] Come here. I don't know what you are. [HELLRAISER BARKING] But please, get away! Get away from me! Uhh. Uh. Ah! Ah! Ah! God! Ah! [SPINE SNAPPING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Keep this. Look upon it to allay this memory. [CHEWING NOISES] Nice. [INDISTINCT POLICE CHATTER] Jesus Christ. Yeah, I knew you'd be impressed. Talk to me. Well, we've got a witness, a woman. That's about it. Where is she? In the ambulance on her way to All Saints. She was incoherent. I can't say that I blame her. This is really something. What'd you have, fish? Detective? You better look at this. I guess they all ain't saints. [HOWLING] WOMAN (OVER THE PA): Dr. Davis-- Veronica, it's Max. You don't pick up. I'm just calling to see how you're doing. I'll be home in a few hours. [WOMAN CRYING] Oop, I gotta go. What's the story here? Found her at a murder scene over at Fifth and Willis. It was pretty bad. That's great, right by my apartment. She doesn't seem to have any injuries, but she's pretty shook up. These are the last days. The fires of Hell await! Just calm down, ma'am. Just calm down. Repent while you can. And beg forgiveness for salvation now, before it's too late! Get some Valium in here, 30 milligrams. Go. - Yeah. DETECTIVE HARPER: Doctor. I'm Detective Donald Harper with homicide. This is my partner, Detective Greenberg. How are you doing? It is vital that we interview this woman as soon as she's-- Coherent. Coherent. I'll do what I can to calm her down, Detective. But I'm not making any promises. These are the last days. The demons! The demons from Hell are coming! All right, let's get her to ER. WOMAN (OVER THE PA): Paging Dr. Dragan. Paging Dr. Dragan. Gentlemen, I'll let you know if there's any improvement. Thank you, Doctor. [SCREAMING] The dogs shall eat their entrails! [ROMANTIC MUSIC] You're just in time for a late supper. Look at this place. You didn't have to wait out for me. And whatever you've got there smells wonderful. It's an old recipe. And quite some place setting you've got here. One only has to look in your kitchen to realize you don't cook very often. I'll be right back. Here you go. Try this. This is delicious. What is it? It's a secret. What's the matter? Nothing. This meat is excellent. How was the night shift, Max? Mm. We had this woman come in who had witnessed a double murder. In fact, it happened in this neighborhood. So you've really gotta watch yourself when you're out there on the streets. These two detectives were all over this woman trying to question her, but she was hysterical. Do they seek the killer? Well, yeah, of course. Do they wish to reward him? No, they want to lock up whoever did it and throw away the key. Perhaps the slain were evil-doers. Well, whatever they were doing, we can't have people running around trying to take the law into their own hands. I mean, that's why we have police. Punishment of evil is the highest virtue one can ascribe to, Max. God's will must be done. What is godly about cutting someone up and hanging them up by their feet? I mean-- I'm sorry to be so graphic. I mean, I overheard these cops talking about it. Look, I believe that human life is sacred. That's why I became a doctor. Human life is a gift from God, Max. That's my whole point. And when a soul takes this gift and dishonors it by the commission of sin, either through betrayal, fraud, or malice, then this soul deserves to suffer eternal torment in the deepest pit of Hell. You don't seem to have doubts about anything, do you? I have no doubts when it comes to sin. You can't believe how vile sin is in the eyes of God. All right. All right, I get your point. REPORTER 7 (ON TV): Mister Mayor, what do you say to your critics for the charge that you're exploiting racial divisions for political gain? MAYOR WHARTON (ON TV): Whether pertaining to jobs or to the prison system's inmate racial balance by percentage, I have no comment on these [INAUDIBLE]. [TYPING ON TYPEWRITER SPEEDING UP] I will hardly support these obstructions [INAUDIBLE] newer, bigger, better, more marginally better equipped and better staffed. [DOG WHINING] REPORTER 7 (ON TV): Mr. Mayor, what do you say to-- [KNOCKING] Come in. What's the word on those killings? Do you think it's a gang thing? No, I don't. I see here the victims all had previous brushes with the law. Whoever's responsible for the killings is probably on some sick quest. I think it would be wise to put more men on this one. Can you imagine what the people would say if you launched some all-out effort to bring in someone who kills muggers? Tell me something, Chief. Have you seen the coroner's report? They were gutted. They were partially devoured by some kind of animal. We are dealing here with a particularly dangerous psycho who's probably into cannibalism. Don't count on this guy to limit his attacks to street criminals. Well, half the town would like to give your psycho cannibal the key to the city. So, you will use the resources you've got. I-- Now, get out of here. I've got work to do. [INDISTINCT POLICE CHATTER OVER RADIO] Hey, you. Excuse me. Where do you think you're going? What are you doing here at this hour? I wasn't aware that there was a law against being out on the street at night. OK, wise guy. There. What is this all about? I have a right to know what this is all about! You just fucked yourself good, boy. [PUNCHING] [GRUNTING] [PUNCHING] [HELLRAISER BARKING] Hey, you better keep moving, Miss. And allow you to do violence upon this man without cause? How would you like to spend the night in jail on a prostitution charge? How would you like to die in a state of mortal sin? [GRUNTING] Ah! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Look upon your enemies lying dead at your feet. Rest assured, these two degenerates will be paying for their sins now. You killed them. These two were evil men. [HELLRAISER GROWLING] [GASPING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [INAUDIBLE] the powers that watch over the Underworld, watch over my [INAUDIBLE] savage Veronica. Keep her safe. Bring the light of understanding to my husband, the ever-faithful Hellikin. [GASPING] Theresa of Hell, your daughter Veronica has broken with the traditions of your people. I know! I know she has broken the laws. I do not deny that. Inform your husband that he must set aside his legendary wrath and suffer his daughter to make her own way, for it has been willed where will is law that she be given over in her current endeavor to help cleanse mankind and give hope to those who are weak and downtrodden. No, no, Theresa. Do not look upon me. Be of good cheer, for your beloved daughter has been sanctioned by the First Cause. [SLOW MUSIC] Ah! Ah! Oh, my god. "I command you to leave politics. Announce your intentions on the magic box, or I shall obliterate you from the face of the earth. Heed this warning or die." You want me to get excited about this? This is a fruitcake letter. The fruitcake who wrote the letter has killed four times in the last two days. Including, of course, the two police officers last night. Do you have any leads? DETECTIVE GREENBERG: Very few, I'm afraid. But we believe that whoever is behind these murders is on some kind of twisted quest for what he believes to be justice. What sort of justice do you think his suspect was thinking of when he killed those two cops? I'm not sure. But I do know that those two officers have more than your average amount of excess force complaints filed against them. Yeah, so why is this person angry with me? You're controversial. You're a public figure. I guess that's enough. The chief asked me to inform, your Honor, that an extra detail of officers will be assigned to you until this whole thing is resolved, one way or the other. Sir. Excuse me, sir. Judge Hayes. Thank you. Wait 'till I tell my wife I met the mayor. [OPERA MUSIC] You should have asked for an autograph. What, are you kidding? My wife hates that little prick. [BABY CRYING] Pardon me, Miss. I'm Detective Greenberg, and this is my partner, Donald Harper, homicide. Do you live here? I'm currently staying here, yes. We'd like to talk to you a moment. Mind if we come in? Please do. The occupant on the lease here is a Dr. Max Barris. Dr. Barris isn't here now? He's at the hospital. And who might you be? My name is Veronica Theresa Maria Agnes Aleppi Esther Valeria Iscariot. That's quite an interesting name. Is that what you came here to tell me? No. I assume you're aware of the assaults that have taken place in the area over the last few days. The killings? Yes. But the slain were evil-doers headed for eternal damnation, were they not? I wouldn't know anything about that, Miss. Two of them had rap sheets, yes. Then let them burn. Uhh, what about the two officers who were killed, Miss? Think that they'll burn, too? Perhaps. Got some very powerful sentience, don't you? Yeah, you ought to try out for the Academy. I have something I want to ask you. Go right ahead. Are you familiar with the mayor of this city? Mayor Wharton? What about him? I've heard it said that you police officers are in his service, that he directs you, that you are agents of his will. I think we're being insulted, Harp. I don't care what you think. Is this man your master? Take care and be truthful. I will know if you lie. We serve the people of this city. I believe you. We found a jacket at the scene of the first killing. There was a label inside of it identifying it with All Saints Hospital. We need to find the owner of that jacket. And you think Max Barris is the one you seek? You want to let us in on what's so funny? Max couldn't hurt a fly. I'd have been far more likely to have killed those evil-doers. Well, it's, uh-- it's time we were on our way. Excuse me, but-- We still have a lot of people to talk to. A lot of people. Forgive us if we put you to any trouble. No trouble at all. Actually, I'm delighted to meet two police officers that aren't tainted by the foul stench of corruption. Well, thank you. You know your way out. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Relax. Don't get too excited. We still have to build a case against this one. - You want to put a tail on her? - Yes. Well, I wouldn't be surprised if she already has one. You look beautiful. I made these garments myself. Yeah, so I can see. Why don't I just change into something more interesting, and we can go? You look nice. Thank you. You wanna go to a movie tonight? I'd love to. There's this one movie that I noticed in the newspaper. It interested me greatly. The theater is called The Popular. What the hell is that animal eating? I like to feed him fresh food once in a while. That is one ugly meal. He'll lick up every last bit. Won't you, sweetheart? SALLY (OVER RADIO): Detective Harper. Over. What is it, Sally? Over. SALLY (OVER RADIO): We ran a check on Dr. Barris. On the nights of the murders, he was working at the hospital until 01:00 hours. Over. Thank you, Sally. Over and out. Now, what about Bigfoot? Oh, you caught that, didn't you? Hey, I'm no slouch. Speak of the devil. [KEYS JANGLING] [ENGINE REVVING] [WOMAN MOANING] WOMAN (ON-SCREEN): Tony. Oh, yes. Oh. [MOANING] TONY (ON-SCREEN): Oh. WOMAN (ON-SCREEN): Oh, Tony! Tony! TONY (ON-SCREEN): Oh, oh! WOMAN (ON-SCREEN): Yes! Yes, oh. [BOTH MOANING] I love a tattoo. Which one? TONY (ON-SCREEN): (MOANING) Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. WOMAN (ON-SCREEN): Oh, please, yes. TONY (ON-SCREEN): Oh, yeah. Yeah. WOMAN (ON-SCREEN): Oh. TONY (ON-SCREEN): Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like-- like-- like that. Like that, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah! WOMAN (ON-SCREEN): Oh, Tony, yes. Yes. Oh, yes. She made us. WOMAN (ON-SCREEN): Oh. TONY (ON-SCREEN): Whoa! [MOANING] WOMAN (ON-SCREEN): Oh! Oh! Jesus! WOMAN (ON-SCREEN): Yes! Oh! Sorry. [CAR ENGINE REVVING] [ROCK MUSIC] How did you like the movie, Max? It was pornographic. I found it very exciting. Yeah, I noticed you did. I've always wanted to witness people coupling, Max. But I never expected it would move me so much. You've never seen a movie like that before? I've never seen any movie. I'll have a coke. Max Barris, you naughty boy! How come you never call me? Hey, Lois. I guess I was just busy working. Lois, this is Veronica. Veronica, this is Lois. She's a friend of mine from medical school. Pre-med, but never bed. Good old Max. Oh, I've got to cool off. I'm sweating. VERONICA: Like a pig. Excuse me? You're sweating like a pig. Nice company you're keeping, Max. Excuse me, I think I'll go freshen up. Why did you say that? She wanted you. Veronica, she's just an old friend. She wanted to fornicate with you, to mingle her fluids with yours. I think I'll freshen up, too, Max. You may [INAUDIBLE]. Oh, that looks good, huh? Thanks. [LAUGHING] [INAUDIBLE] Yeah. Oh. - What? - What's that? WOMAN 4: I don't know. WOMAN 5: What's going on? WOMAN 4: It's probably too much power. Get out. Get out! WOMAN 4: What? WOMAN 5: Just go! Just go! WOMAN 4: What's your problem? WOMAN 6: God. [GASPING] Don't you know that it's wrong to covet? [SCREAMING] That's my man out there, you harlot! What gives you the right to make a fool out of me? I'm sorry if I offended you! Sorry? I'll tear you from limb to limb. [LAUGHING MANIACALLY] It's OK. [SOBBING] [SCREAMING] Ah! Oh, ow. Ow. [GASPING] Oh. [ELECTRICITY WHIRRING] [SOBBING] [LAMP BREAKING] Ah! [GASPING] What have I done to deserve this? Forgive me. [SOBBING] Is this what you wanted to see, Detective? So soft and white. Don't, please. Do you feel your life in there, Detective? I can feel your blood pumping through your guts. Now, listen to me. You can't get away with killing a police officer. Now listen to me, Detective. I want you out of my life. And I don't want you bothering Max Barris. Max is the gentlest soul I've ever known. And you are going to promise me that you're going to leave him alone. Why should I make any promises to you? Don't you know what I am? No. Let me show you. [VOICES SCREAMING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] There isn't a hole deep enough for you to hide in if I decide to come after you. [YELLING] Ah! [DANCE MUSIC] Hey. Well, what took you so long? I asked Lois to forgive me. [INDISTINCT POLICE CHATTER OVER RADIO] Oh! Ah! Ah! Oh, ah. What the hell happened to you? You look like somebody ran you through a garbage disposal. I'm still cold. Here, have some coffee. It's still warm. Jesus! It's hot! Hot! Ah! Ah. Jesus Christ. [CAR ENGINE REVVING] Let him go. What? You heard me. Let him go. Oh, [INAUDIBLE]. DETECTIVE HARPER: I'm OK. Jesus. I'm OK now. Easy. All right, show me. What in the hell happened here? It's a knife wound. I've got to get you to Emergency for stitches. I can't go to the hospital. Well, I can't stitch you up here. I don't have any anesthetic. I don't need anything. I'm fine. I'm telling you, it's really going to hurt. Do it now, Max. Are you attracted to me? Yes, of course I am. I want us to have sexual intercourse. [TOOLS DROPPING] Veronica, you are a complete and utter mystery to me. I'm sorry if I'm not going about it the right way, Max. I don't know what the right way is. I'm not bound by your rules, Max. The laws that I live by are the same laws the animals live under. I don't require the blessing of the one true church to engage in sexual relations. What are you talking about? I'm not human, Max. I turn into another person, a person that might repulse you. I want you inside me, Max. You don't have to recite lines from the movie. I want to be as alluring to you as that actress was to her beloved, Tony. I'm not Tony, and this is not a movie. Now, hold still. All right. All done. Now you can close your top up. [SLOW MUSIC] I don't want to, Max. Veronica, I don't think we should get into it. Why not? Because, I don't think it's the right time. I'm not in pain, Max. My wound will heal. [ROMANTIC MUSIC] [CLOCK TICKING] [TICKING STOPS] [GLASS BREAKING] I can't help myself. It's all right. [BINDER FALLING] [SOFT TAPPING] You have to explain this to me, because I am very confused. He wants off the case, Chief. What? He wants to take himself off this case. What is going on here? I don't know. [PHONE RINGING] These are the last days. [WHIRRING] [PAINTING FALLING] Who are you? My name is Veronica Theresa Maria Valaria Iscariot of Hell, the only daughter of Theresa Agnes Maria Iscariot and Hellikin Pontius Aleppi Iscariot, the son of Curly Bird Pontius Aleppi Iscariot and Maria Theresa, Iscariot of the House of Agnes, related by marriage to-- I need to ask you a question. Are you responsible for those murders? Yes, Max. That's what my kind do. It's God's work. And that's why you came here. I'm here because I was compelled to you. You found me because-- because I was lost. You have little faith. So, if there really is a Hell, does that mean that there is a Heaven, too? Yes, Max. It is in the shape of a great wheel with God in the center, acting as the ultimate fulcrum from which all knowledge, love, and justice emanate. Sleep, my beloved. [HELLRAISER PANTING] Hellraiser, I need you to concentrate on this being for me. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Did you get him? [HELLRAISER WHIMPERING] Huh? [WHIRRING] Hm? Mm. [SNORING] [OPERA MUSIC] [WHIRRING] [GLASS BREAKING] [GASPING] [OPERA MUSIC] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Mm. Mm. Hmmm. [TOOTH BREAKING] [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC] [GASPING] [TOOTH DROPPING INTO SINK] [GASPING] (SHOCKINGLY) Huh? [DOOR CLOSING] [CURTAIN RUSTLING] [LIGHTS FLICKERING] Hm? I have you at last, you little fucker. Hm! [GASPING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Who the hell are you? Yes. What do you want? I want to show you what awaits for you in eternity. Look at me. No! Look at me! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [VOICES SCREAMING] No! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Halt! Ah! [GASPING] [SNORING] I've come all the way from Heaven to tell you that your beloved daughter is in great danger. Tell us what to do! I need your permission to bring her home and a Mercer in the River Styx. [GASPING] You have it! And Hellikin, you must promise forgiveness to your daughter, for she is an agent of the First Cause. I give you my word. [SLOW MUSIC] Oh, my god. I'm calling an ambulance. Don't bother, Max. No one can help me now. Don't say that. Please don't say that. Veronica. Veronica. I've come to take you home. I don't know what you are, but she's in shock. And I've got to take her to the hospital. She's going to Hell. If they can help her, fine. But if you're taking her home to die, I won't let you! Veronica must bathe in the healing waters of the River Styx. It is the only way she will survive. I don't want to leave you, Max. If what she's saying is true, and at this point I'd believe anything, it's probably your only chance. You're losing too much blood. What if I can't get back? Then I will do something so terrible that we'll end up there together. [SIGHING] I've learned so much here, Max. I've learned that forgiveness is attainable for anyone that lives. You taught me that. Keep your eye on that mayor. What does he have to do with anything? You'll see. Come now. Come quickly. [WHIRRING] [HELLRAISER WHIMPERING] REPORTER 8 (ON TV): We interrupt this broadcast for a special news bulletin. And now, live from City Hall, the mayor is about to make a statement. MAYOR WHARTON (ON TV): Citizens of our fair city, I've been your mayor for 16 years. Looking back on what I've accomplished, I realize I've behaved in a selfish, greedy, disgusting manner throughout my entire tenure as your mayor. Should I not be forced to serve a well-earned prison sentence? I plan to retire to a monastery and devote my remaining years to the contemplation of goodness. Thank you. [FIRE GROWING STRONGER] [FIRE EXPLODING] Thank you, God. [ROMANTIC MUSIC] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [SLOW MUSIC] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC]
