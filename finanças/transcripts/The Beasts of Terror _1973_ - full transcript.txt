Alright, leave him alone. Look Pedro, I told you I collect the debts owed to me. so you better start thinking about what you're doing. Hold it. We need to kidnap that millionaire as soon as possible. and pay off your debt. if we don't want another visit from Lucky's people. The Beasts of Terror I'm gonna take a look around, keep an eye on her. You know she's worth a lot of money. I hope your sister gives us what we're asking for you, if not... you know what will happen. You know my sister will give you the money, but please let me go. Alright, it looks like no one followed us. Go to the road and stop a car, you know what to do. You didn't leave me with her too long, you know me well. Please, take me to the city! I was attacked and they took my car! Calm down Miss, get in and I'll take you. Walk towards the trees. and don't try anything if you don't want me to blow your brains out. Let's go, walk! We have a car. Let's go. Hurry! Do what I say, go on, move it! Too bad, I had to ice him to get the car. That's why I like you. I don't know what I'd do without you. Let's go. I'm going to make a phone call and buy something to eat. We hope your sister will pay what we asked, or else... My throat is dry, get me a drink. Take care of our songbird, she might try to fly away. I hope your millionaire sister is understanding. It was simple, your sister agreed to cough up the dough. You'll be free early tomorrow. Go on, have a drink, cheer up. You look scared. No thanks, I don't drink. If she's not gonna drink, then pass me the bottle. Dammit! Hurry up and change the tire, we wouldn't want to be caught carrying corpses. - There's no air in it. - Damn. Watch her. - Hold it, put your hands on the tree. - But... Obey or die. Don't make that face woman, you'll soon be free. - Don't you... - Hold it. - But... - Put your hands behind your back. Put him in the back. We were lucky Doctor, it looks like we found the kidnappers they're looking for. Their car could be useful, but what should we do with them? Well now, we're really in luck. These two women interest me more than you imagine. Here, man the controls. Don't be afraid girl, nothing will happen to you. Your energy and blood will be used to give life to that cadaver. and so discover the mystery of the cerebral neurons. Start the power. At last, at last I've managed to accomplish what I've worked for all my life. You were finally able to spend a night with me Tony. You know I like nothing better than being with you dear. Hello, who is it? Laura? This is a surprise. Yes, yes, how terrible. Yes, I know. Look... I'll see you in less than 20 minutes. - You'll forgive me babe but I- - Yes, yes, like always Mr. Investigator. You're going to get wrapped up in another mess, right? That's why I fear for my sister's life, it's very strange the kidnappers didn't call when they said they would. Look, don't be alarmed, I'm sure they just haven't decided where to have you deliver the money. Tony, you're the only one that can find her. They said that if I called the police, they'd kill Susie. Don't worry Laura, everything will be fine. I'll look for some contacts and let you know how things are going. Thank you very much, I know you'll do the impossible to find her. What's wrong Tony, you're really nervous. Sorry Blue, but you have to be prepared for anything. And Santo? I gave him your message, but he couldn't come, I'll see him tonight in the arena. What's this about? The sister of a friend of mine has been kidnapped. They're asking for a huge ransom. We're dealing with a very dangerous organization, that's why I asked to meet you here. You know you can count on us. What's your plan? My plan is as follows: you, Santo and I. will meet at the arena tonight to see what we will do. in regards to what I've told you in relation to... Hold it Rocco! You're a pig! This woman is under the effect of a drug, she's prepared for my next experiment. You have to leave her alone Rocco. I promised to give her to you. but not before I'm done. Have you gotten me a new cadaver? So how's it going handsome? Very well love, I promise I'll come by for you. That changes everything, but if you stand me up. I swear you'll regret it honey. - How's it going Lucky? - Hello Tony. - I need your help - How can I help you? Remember you owe me a lot of favours. What's this about Tony? You know I pay my debts, how can I serve you? They've kidnapped a good friend of mine's sister. and they're asking for a lot of money. but until now I haven't heard a word from the kidnappers. What does that have to do with me? You know kidnapping isn't my business. I know, but maybe you heard something on the street, - you know? - Yes, yes, I understand Tony. Well, if I hear anything I'll let you know. And you know that if you get news soon. there'll be more big bills, like this Tell your sister Glenda I said hello. Yes? Doctor, we have a problem, an investigator is looking for the kidnapped girl. An investigator? And how do you know that it's her he's looking for? I heard it from a friend that works in a cabaret. Alright, follow him and keep me up to date. Calling Santo. Santo here, go on Tony. Any news? Not at the moment. How is it possible that that girl's kidnappers haven't left a trail? Then you think that... No, that girl is still alive. Sir! Sir! Sir. You're surely Santo, the Man in the Silver Mask, right? - What's wrong? - It's great that you're here, you must be investigating the grave robbings, right? Tonight they stole another woman's corpse. I tried to call the police, but my telephone line was cut. I hope you haven't forgotten so soon that you used to work for me Sandro. After all, thing's weren't so bad with me, you made a lot of money. I know Lucky. If I left it's because I went to work for a millionaire doctor. Now I make more than you can imagine. Alright, alright Sandro, but you can tell me where to find Pedro and Nora, right? And that little millionaire girl. You do know where they are, right? Of course I know, but it will cost a lot of money for me to loosen my tongue, don't forget we're talking about a millionaire. And you know Lucky, maybe I'll handle this business myself. We have to get out of here as soon as possible. and take the girl with us if we want to collect the ransom. I have to pay Lucky, I don't want another visit from his people. Don't worry, I know a way to do it. Haven't you realized, that the doctor likes me? Maybe I'll hit it big here, - I'm sick of always running - What did you say? You know me very well, you know what I'm capable of if you try to betray me. You're very impulsive, that's why I like you. I was only thinking we could use that crazy doctor. Alright Nora, but sometimes you say things that hurt me. and make me angry. Grab them. You're quite indiscreet, you have no idea what's going to happen to your little friend. Put him in the cell. Bastard. I'm sure Lucky's contact won't fail us Santo. Agreed Tony, but if he did fail. I'm sure we'd soon have a new lead. - Here, they told me to give this to you. - Thank you If you want to know where Susie is, be at the cabaret at 11. Go alone. Tony, be very careful, this could be a new trap. Don't worry Santo, I'll be prepared. Hopefully. These women will be shipped off to another country tomorrow Their cerebral neurons have been treated in such a way that. they've forgotten the past. They're bound to my will, they won't listen to anyone but me. You'll go with them, but first you'll receive the punishment you deserve. Rocco, take them away. Only the fact that you're a woman saves your life. No one escapes Matthews' vengeance. Punish her Sandro, punish her! More! More! Enough Sandro, enough! You can go Sandro, and don't forget to bring me that investigator. I'll carry out your orders as always Nora, you're marvellous, unique... The most beautiful woman I've known. Forgive me Nora, forgive me. Now I'll have to make it up to you. Ask me for what you want, you will never regret having met me. Santo, I'm grateful you accepted my invitation to say goodbye. Thank you Lieutenant, it's been a pleasure. Though your stay was only temporary, believe me when I say the local authorities are very grateful. It's my life Lieutenant, my profession as a wrestler and as an investigator. Listen Santo, now there's a rash of grave robbings. and thefts of women?s' corpses. - Did you say women? - I did. Exclusively women? What are you thinking Santo, do you believe...? No, I can't tell you anything. Sir, they're waiting for you in the parking lot. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I'll be right back. There's the guy, I'll be right back. Are you the one interested in the girl they kidnapped? - Yes, what do you know about her? - A lot. Come with me. This way. Hold it. Calling Santo, calling Santo. Thank you again Lieutenant, goodnight. Rest well Santo. Calling Santo. Santo here. - Santo, can you hear me? - Yes I haven't lost sight of them, I'm on highway 84. Your friend is comfy. You see, nothing has happened to him He doesn't matter, I have you. Why do you have him locked up? You want me to free him? I guess that depends on you. If you play along... Now you're gonna sing friend. I don't need much, just tell me the millionaire's name. I want him alive too! Let's go Sandro! Did you hear the name? He said Sandro. Yes. - What did they do to you? - Nothing, thanks to you. I'm taking a plane to Mexico. Have a good trip Santo, and don't worry, I'll be at our friend Tony's side. - Alright. Goodbye. - Goodbye. We're late, we had some problems. When you've loaded the women I'll be waiting in the basement. Demon? What are you doing here? You're not going to tell me that after so many years you've come to train. Just to say hello Freddy. I also wanted to ask for your help, they kidnapped the sister of a good friend of mine. Really? And how can I help you? Remember that I'm not a policeman. Last night I was attacked by a gang of assailants, one of the thugs mentioned someone named Sandro and I remembered... Sandro, Sandro... wasn't he a wrestler from your time? Well now he's a thug. Yes, that's the one. I'll never forget him. I remember there was a time when he tried his hand at blackmail. Yes Tony, all I can say is that. that bastard Lucky and Sandro were up to something serious. and that you're wrapped in on this. You have to watch out for Lucky, he'd betray his own mother. Look dear, I know him better than anyone, that miserable rat is capable of anything. I heard quite clearly when Sandro talked about some female millionaire, that he was going to get the ransom on his own. and that he knew where the girl and the kidnappers were. - Sandro? - Yes. Who is he? He's a thug that hangs out at the cabaret, it'd be easy to meet him if you want. Do you know something? I'd like to meet the god who created you, to congratulate him. He was very inspired. Besides being a lovely doll you've got brains to go with it. What do you think of all I've told you Blue? There's no doubt that there incredible coincidences exist Tony. You're telling me you've identified Sandro. as a prime mover in the kidnapping, right? It's very important we find him. Exactly. I'm going to the cabaret tonight to meet him. I know him Tony, and I want you to know that I'm on his trail as well. He was a wrestler a while ago but now he's just a criminal. Get ready Blue, they're waiting. Don't worry Tony, I'll see you later. Do you remember the date you were born? Well now make note of the day you will die. The day one dies is decided ahead of time by destiny. Well, well, kidnapper and philosopher. You're about to learn how one pays for offending the eminent Dr. Matthews. Sandro, the dogs! Obey my orders Sandro. You see what your master is capable of. Don't risk the same fate if you disobey me. I need that investigator immediately. Go! You have no reason to be scared We're both in the same rat trap and in the hands of an old madman. But I thought that you- That I was working with the doctor, is that it? In my life I've run in to many men. but I only love one, Pedro, and I'm prepared to do anything to save him and ourselves. But what will you do with me? I promise if you manage to save me my sister will pay you well. Don't worry, everything will turn out fine. Calling Blue. Blue, I'm at the rear of the cabaret. I'm on my way. That's it, out. I came to sell you the secret you're so interested in, but I have to warn you, I have to charge right now. Alright, alright, how much? 50 thousand, not a cent less. I'm sorry, but I don't have more than 10 thousand. - Take it or leave it. - No deal. My life is worth much more. I said 50 thousand, I have to run away to Puerto Rico. Well, this is just a down payment. And how will you guarantee the rest? What more guarantee than my word do you need Sandro? Look, we'll get in touch in a few days. Go to Puerto Rico, take it. Alma, have you seen Sandro? Yes, he just left, I know he's heading to Puerto Rico. I'll head there immediately. - I'll go with you Blue - No, you have a lot to do here, besides, it's a personal matter. We have a very important lead Santo, it seems a man named Sandro is the key to this business. I congratulate you Blue. I'll take the first flight tomorrow to Miami. We have the key figure, he's called Sandro, but he's fled to Puerto Rico. Blue Demon should have caught up to him by now, no doubt he'll make him talk. Then this business is practically resolved, but there's something else perhaps even more important than this kidnapping. - You think so? - Let's go. Now I have you bastard. You thought I wouldn't find you but now you'll pay for everything. Alright you wretch, where's the girl that was kidnapped? Talk! The girl... is in.. Dr. Matthews'... house. I... That's right, sit there and do nothing. But what can I do? Of course, since life's given you everything. now you can't think of anything to save your own skin. You're very wrong, life hasn't given me everything, my sister and I had to work hard to get where we are. If I could do something I would. Of course you can do something to save yourself and us. Remember that you're a woman. Haven't you realized that that idiot Paolo likes you? Convince him to steal the keys Alright, I'll try. Don't pretend, you know well how a woman can convince a man. What are you doing here? You don't know how grateful I am to you cutie. Alright, about time. Look Blue, luckily our information coincides. Now we know where the girl is and which is the doctor's house. Should we attack right away? - Yes. - Alright. I'll let the Susie's sister know. Yes? Very good Tony. Lieutenant Anderson? This is Alma the dancer. Tony Carelli, the investigator. asked me to tell you that he needs you urgently. at Dr. Matthews' house. Yes. I gave you an opportunity and you didn't take advantage of it. No one mocks Dr. Matthew without paying for it with their life. Why did you betray me? Did I not offer you everything in exchange for so little? This acid can destroy your face in an instant. It's impossible to get through here. You two, go over there. You, come with me. Hold it, hold it. Let's go! Hold it. Freeze! It's useless Lucky! Give yourself up Lucky! Give yourself up Lucky! Let's go. Take them away. Let's go. - Let me go! - Let me loose! Oh Susie, my sister. Don't cry, it's all over, it's all over. Don't cry anymore. The End Translation: Turdis July 2009 Ressynch: Kilo
