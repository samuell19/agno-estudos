Each generation eventually decides that all the generations that went before were fools that the world is just an awful place and that they can change it. They rebel and in their rebellion they find some new way to drive their parents insane. Rebecca Sobel reports on the newest bit of rebellion, it's called Slam dancing. The music these kids like is called Hardcore. The lyrics, when you can hear them shout about freedom, being yourself. And if you're looking for a melody, forget it. The music is loud, fast, period.

When you go on the dancefloor with these manianic real stud braces and just fuckin' circle jerk style, you know? These are cool, when I'm puttin' this on, wanna get in the pit now. I got a couple of people I'd like to backslab like they do today. We used to make our own shirts, you know, like... we used to show up to the venues with just screens and as we go we'll sell screen shirts. We just had the screens and ink and just squeeze 'em out and sell 'em fresh, you know? It's pretty crazy. This is cool shit, man, you know? And I'm lookin' at this and just remembering how, how really cool the scene was. How creative, how together, how genuine it was. This is when New York was magical. I don't know what this is. Oh, shooting targets. It goes hand in hand with hardcore. There you go. You know, sometimes when I look through all this, it brings back so many memories, and kinda wish I did more lookin' through all this. It's like, I don't really know what's in, all in this trunk. It's kinda sad to know that all, everything in here is... I put so much passion and time into collecting, and, I don't know why, sometimes I just block it out. Just... It's like everything else I've done in my life as a child. I block things out and I don't know why. But the good thing about it is when I do open it and look through it, I'm interested to go back. Watch out. Ah. Wow! They put fences on this roof. I haven't been up here in a while. Used to be see... able to see all the way to Chinatown and now there's fuckin' trees in the way. They all live here now. Patrick Stewart lives here. Moby... lives over there. David Bowie lives over there. But I live right here all my life. They wanna live near me, I guess. Huh. Hey, it's not a bad place to live. Good people, you know? Ah. My grandfather's pigeon coop was right over here. When I was a kid, I used to climb down here, go d.. go take care of his pigeons. You know, he used to let 'em out. They had racing pigeons, homers, grizzles. Me, personally, I liked fancy tails, you know, like satinettes and caps. You know, fancy-tail birds, they're not good fliers, but they're really like show birds. But, it's a dying thing now too. You're not even allowed to have a pigeon coop on the roof. Thanks to fuckin' Giuliani. That fuckin' hard-on ruined my fuckin' city! He's a boondoggle motherfucker. I don't know anymore. Ah! I get fed up sometimes. Watch yourself. My name is Vincent Capuccio. I was born on December 3rd, 1955. New York City. I'm 60 years old. If I didn't play music, I think I woulda winded up workin' for 20 years or whatever it is. I collected my check and I would've been dead twenty years ago, like... Like, ten years ago I would've been retired. I go out and I live. First of all, I like playing the guitar. I played the guitar my whole life. Like, really, technically. And I just enjoyed doin' it. I like gettin' together with a bunch of guys go to the studio, you know, ordering a few pizzas, a couple of six-packs, you know what I mean? I enjoy myself. I enjoy life. I'm havin' a good time, man. I always have a good time. And I-I-I live like, in the rest of the world. Like, don't misunderstand me. I believe in Santa Claus. You know... you know, you gotta believe. You gotta have that, you can't lose that... that kid in you. You know what I mean? 'Cause when you lose that kid in you I think you get jaded. But I got a lot more music in me. I got a lot more life in me. When the day comes, it'll come. God wants, it'll come. But until that day comes, fuck you, man, I'm going. Oh, yeah, that's good. So let's tape off the dash. You know "Agnostic Front" is a... it's, uh, it's my life. It really is. It's, uh... I don't know, let me see, let me try and figure out how to describe it. Um, it's been a big part of my life since I was a kid, you know? It fascinates me that people wanna talk about something that I've done or... or written or created. And it feels good sometimes that people care, you know? And that's the ty-type of person I am. That's why I put so much into the band because I care. And sometimes I think I care a little too much. Like, there's things that probably wouldn't bother a normal person and it bothered me. You know, it's because, uh... Maybe because I put too much into it. and I put so much of myself into it that it'll bother me if anybody thinks anything different of it. To-to anybody just observing it from the outside in would probably question what is the band, and a lot of people, the first thing they get is this some kind of a anti-religious type of a thing. You know? But it's not true. "Agnostic" meaning in doubt of the absolute truth till you see it with your own eyes. And that's what it truly means to me. It truly means questioning authority, questioning society, just questioning everything. Like, there's a lot of doubt out there and I'm not gonna just believe what they say I should believe. I wanna see it with my own eyes. I am very frustrated with the way things are happening in the world today as it was when I was a kid. I bring it upon myself just because I'm... I am that curious person and I do wanna know and I don't want somebody to tell me what I need to believe. So, in my own seekin' it for the truth, I bring frustration and aggravation and... But it fuels my... my fire and brings my lyrics out brings... Makes my magic happen. It kinda checks me back in point, you know? What I'm more... more grateful of anything that "Agnostic Front" has brought to me in my life is I've been living what everybody else waits and works so hard for till they hit that 65 years, to live their life, and sometimes it can be 20, 30 years, sometimes it's just two or three. Sometimes people really worked so hard till they're 65 and that's all they know and they stop and they just drop dead, right? I've been living a great life. Enjoyable life, doin' what I really wanna do. I've been living my dream. Breeze by afternoon, can you believe it? Mostly overcast skies. There's a little relief coming tonight in the form of some cooler air it's gonna bring some goobers hope the thunder doesn't shake you out of bed. But, hey, at 65 degrees, that's perfect for getting a little bit of shut-eye... Vinnie lives a very simple life. And, you know, Vinnie. That's who Vinnie is. If it... Something rubs him the wrong way, he eliminates it. But he lives a very smooth, peaceful life. He really does. So it's summer in the city. If you have some outdoor fun plan Sunday is gonna be your best bet. This is Mid, your morning meteorologist. I'll keep my eyes to the skies and you keep your hands off the dial. Well, you know, Vinnie is born and raised right where he is today, you know? He was born downstairs in his mom's apartment. Right where Vinnie is, right in the same floor there was, there's five apartments. His aunt was there, you know? His cousin Baps, you know, was right there. And upstairs his other aunt. There's a whole family lived in this building. I mean, the doors were open at all time. Nothing was ever locked. And they would come in and out as they please. Like, if it was some giant duplex and, uh, wake people up, or whatever, it was family. My entire life, all 60 years, I lived in this buildin'. My whole family lived here. This is where I come from. This is, you know, w-where I belong. We used to play skelsy right over here. You know, skelsy? They write the thing with a chalk and you get the caulk. We used to fill the caulk with, uh, wax, you know? Melted wax, because we used to make wax hands and feet for St. Rocco, he's a saint of mine. And, uh, he's like the Saint of Illness, you know? Like, Saint Lucy is the Saint of the Eyes. I always love Saint Lucy 'cause she's a little lady like in a black veil, and she's got a dish with two eyeballs. Scared the shit out of me till today. See right here? I used to come out of my buildin' right across the street, that was "Murder, Incorporated." And that's where all the gangsters used to hang out. That's the mafia's mafia, you know? When they gotta kill a mafia guy, they call those guys. Because they're the baddest of the bad. Mergo! Pssh... How are you? -Hi, Carmine. How you doin'? -Alright. -I'll be here tomorrow night. -Okay. Yeah, alright. He's got a good heart. Vinnie's got a good heart. You know, he just likes genuine people. And that's why we got along real good. We don't... We don't, never put a lot of things in between us. Even though we're very different, we really are, but when we come together as "Agnostic Front" we're, we're, we're a team, you know? Wow! Look, look, a raven. It's a raven on top of that car. Whoa! -Stigma always liked ravens. -Yeah. Always, always liked ravens for some weird reason. Stranglers. That's why. He loves his stranglers. Always, "A raven! A raven! A raven!" I mean, what, it's a raven. I know, you show me an eagle, or an owl, you know, what the fuck, raven? He knows me better than anyone else who have ever known me. And he's... knows my family, you know what I mean? Like, my sister, he talks to my sister, talks to my brothers, talks to my mother, like he's, you know, he's one of us, you know? One, two, three, alright. I'm in the same band for 35 years now. You know, with Roger. You know, I used to be his older brother, but now he's like my older brother, you know? There's nothing that can ever come between us. No money, no religion, no, no ego. Y-y-you know... n-n-n-nothin'. Keep the... Keep it aligned with the dots. We'll be good then, because we're gonna do three more new songs, then we stop. Jay. Should we do that intro to uh, Old New York? You could do whatever you want. So let me hear Dead To Me. I mean, intro let me hear Dead To Me. You don't wanna do, uh, The American Dream Died? -Eh, it may not be worth... -Nah We got enough new songs... No, no, don't... If they know the new song, they'll hear that intro. Well, to be honest with you, it's been an addiction, you know? It's been, uh... It's been so... so much of my life it's... I'm so passionate about it, I love it so much. I mean, really. Just like still with My Life My Way, I have to see which was the first line. That's all, the first line. There's been times where... where I've been frustrated. Sometimes you sit back and thinkin' like, "Why am I doin' this, like, you know?" "I've got my family, people I love, blah-blah-blah, you know?" I've got my job, I got everything. But, you know, Vinnie's always been pushin' me in a way. He was like, "Oh, I wanna... Can I just do it till I'm 50?" And now, he's got this thing, "Alright, till I'm 60." "Come 62," you know? And I almost feel guilty that if I stop, I'm kinda takin' somethin' away from him. The guy really loves hardcore. I mean, it's his life, it really is. He just loves it. He loves the shows. He loves bein' there. He loves bein' a part of it. The thing about Vinnie is there is no other 60-year-old man that I know that behaves or acts or does anything like him. You know, he lives life. I think the guy knows that it's a crank call. He's gotta know. I mean, it's so ridiculous. Look at the size of this fuckin' phone. Man, it'd be good for coke. Chop... Hello? -Hello? -Hello? I want... Listen. I wanna get a tattoo. Who is this? Never mind, who the fuck this is, I wanna get a tattoo. This is a tattoo studio, right? I wanna get your fuckin' tattoo on my fuckin' back. But I got pimples on my back. You've gotta squeeze the pimples before we fuckin' tattoo the fuckin' t-thing on. I want a picture of Rocky on my back. You gonna do it or what? -Who is this? -Never mind, who this is. I told you the first fuckin' time, ya cocksucker. -Stigma? -Yeah, he got it. He knows. I crank call him all the time. Yeah, it's me, Vinnie. How are you, Mark? We're talkin' shit about you. I try to take a little bit from both of those guys, you know? I gotta say, the both of those guys in the past 14 years that I've been in this band, they're, like, my best friends and they're, like, almost like father figures. They believe in what they do. You got a crazy maniac like Stigma and then you've got a super-serious guy like Roger who handles all the business, who handles all the important stuff, you know, the things that make the machine work. And then you got this nut Stigma... who is just so... Heh! -Wow! -Comin' to the show today? There's nobody else like him in the world. And even I remember going to see them as a kid, like... I couldn't wait to see them on stage. Well, he's got something about him that a lot of people just don't have. And people see that, you know? He's a real character, man. He is a character's character. Thank you very much, everybody! I'd like to thank MAD for being here and puttin' on this show. Thank you. And all the rest of the old school parley crew. We've been playin' this place a lotta years. And you know what? It only gets better. We also want to thank Corte Records. Give it up for Cortex Records! Are you ready to sing this one with me?

I like the fact that I'm moving, I'm goin' different places, I'm meeting people. I'm, I'm taking stuff in. You know, like, I can't do Groundhog Day. I can't do the same thing over and over.

There was that empty feeling inside of me that I just needed to explore. I needed to go out there. I need to-to... Especially, when I found people that were like me and I felt so close to them, I felt that bond. I felt that... that togetherness.

What a night tonight, great, great, great, historic guest in the studio with us, of course, main stay at the Lower East Side, my brother, my mentor... one of my mentors, one of my older brothers, Vinnie Stigma. -Vinnie, what's up? -Joe, how are you? -Good to see you, brother. -Yeah, we love you, man. It's always a pleasure to have you down here. Uh, Vinnie, what you've done, and-and-and helped out, and-and created for this community, uh, it's amazing, man. And-and I'm stoked to hear all the good things happenin' about you, you know? And, uh, I'm-I'm happy to see someone, uh, like you, you know, getting what to do, getting the attention you deserve, you and Roger and the band, and all the people you influenced throughout the hardcore, punk rock, throughout the whole music community. Not just hardcore and punk rock, I saw some sting with M-Metallica? Yeah, I'm in, uh, Guitar World this month with Metallica. -What? -Yeah, I got the centerfold. Yo, the centerspread, you know. -Shit, the centerspread! -Get the fuck outta here! Oh, you gotta read the article. It is so great, man. I'm telling you right now. It's so much fun. I talked nothin' about guitars. I just talk about life, you know? That, that's, that's really good, man. You're givin' a kid out there a little hope, a little direction. -Yeah... -You know? That's, that's what it is. I mean... Yeah, because hardcore is freedom. Don't let them tell you what to eat, what to believe in, what to drink, you got your own mind, make it up for yourself, and take it from me, I'm a real New Yorker, you could tell by the fuckin' accent. I love you. I'm your friend. I gotta let you know these things, alright. -Thank you. I'll see you later. -I'll catch you later. Alright. Alright. Ritchie, I'll see you later. Papa! -You're looking good. -Alright. -I love your style. -You're lookin' better. I cannot not like you! I don't care. I got it. I'll take my shirt off in the rain, I don't care. That's the sound of New York, baby. So, "Agnostic Front" in the history of music is always gonna be one of those bands that chances are you could be anywhere in the world. And that name could come out and somebody out of leftfield that happens to be in that room when that name is mentioned is gonna say "I know that band." Chances are that person doesn't own any of their music but they somehow know that name. Like, to me, that's an illustration of how much of an impact that band has made, that it can touch on mainstream popularity, but not have literally achieved it. You know, obviously, there is this incredibly raw element to Agnostic Front. That it, it can't be mainstream. This is a slam-dancing club in New York City. And if you think this looks weird, just look at these kids up close. In cities like Boston, Los Angeles, Washington, and here in New York, they dress punk and hang around slam-dancing clubs. And while they look as scuzzy as the club itself, this one in New York is called the A7. These kids do have a philosophy. And it's not anywhere near as bad as they look. People have been encouraged to participate, you know, you can be in a band, you can be a photographer, you can just go to shows and support things and buy the records and get involved and get interested. Instead of people just sit at home and wonder what to do and watch TV, you know, people have a chance to be creative and, and have a chance to express themselves. It's, it's really a matter of, of getting that chance instead of blindly following all the time, you know? There's a whole network around this entire country that's supporting this underground movement and it's grown. We don't bend down to rock stars and-and to what's on the commercial radio stations. Everybody knows each other. They come down and they play. That's why this club's like the A7 club and what's happening around. 'cause all the kids come around get together and play music. Well, it's an entire cross-section. We have different age groups, you know, some people who are just kids, some people a little older. And, all in all, we have our entire variety of different people, you can't really get it down to one sort or type of person. We have, uh, different races, different sexes... It's not really a clearly defined movement. Let's begin with what is the movement all about? It's all a whole new way of-of thinking, you know? It's-it's, it has nothing to do with age, age, the way you look, the way you dress, it has nothin' to do with it. It has nothin' to do with it at all. What really matters, is your attitude and how, how you think about yourself and, and like, how you treat different people, you know? Like people sayin', well, the world's never gonna be good, it's always gonna be messed up and people are always gonna be like, out for themselves and you're never gonna be able to change it, it's not true, you know? If all the kids get together in the world, right? And we all feel the same way about one particular thing, you know? And then we just spread out, farther and farther, you know? People s-say it's impossible. Well, you're just a small clique of kids. You can't do anything about what's goin' on in the world and that's true, like, today it's true. If we try now, to stick together, right? And maybe it'll get better, you know? Well, we don't really know what the future's gonna be. We just go about it everyday and whatever happens is gonna happen. And we just try to do the best of, uh... at what we do. You know, we try to do our best-- And how will it change the outside world? This, this is killin' the record industries but we're cutting our own records, we don't need them. They're profiteering off of us. This... Well, this is, that's the real world. Right? Ain't that the real world you said before? -Right? -I didn't say that. -You said it. -You said it before. You asked a question to this guy. -Alright. Well, anyway-- -You just did. We're cuttin' them down. You know, we don't need them to exploit us, you know? We don't want them, like, you buy a record for two songs an album for $11 and the rest is dead-ass space. I don't wanna hear it. We-we're proving to people that we don't have to follow them and conform to their... aspects of society. We don't have to be like everyone else. We can rebel by, you know, b-by being different, and to being into different kind of music. -Not cooperating with them. -Not cooperating with society. We can be against society and live in our own... Make our own society without, you know lowering ourselves to their standards. Fight against society, not each other. -Cut. -Good, excellent! -Bravo! -Bravo! -Fantastic. -Bravo! Thank you. This scene was just a by-product of the '80s and, uh, pissed, angry youth you know, that's the scene. To be honest with you, that's what it came out of 'em. What collectively drew everybody's attention was this aggressive music, what we all had to say. A lot of the people involved in the scene were either runaways, or just outcasts, misfits that didn't belong with everyone else. We were young kids, we looked out for each other protected each other... ♪ Let you down ♪ Agnostic Front didn't create the New York City hardcore scene. This scene was created by all my friends and, if it wasn't for all of us being together, going to each other's shows, supporting each other, who knows? We hung out in the Lower East Side when it was a place, m-most dangerous time ever. This is not the New York City you go see now. This is not the Times Square you go see now. This was legit, this was a true ghetto. And pretty much, we had it all to ourselves. New York City is a violent town. Murder is an everyday occurrence. Yeah, it was a war zone. It really was. A lot of abandoned buildings, a-a lotta devastation. It was a lotta drugs. You know, it-it was just a bad area. Shootings, muggings, gangs, street gangs. All around us, so we naturally had our own gang, you know? We were the Lower East Side crew. Back in 1982-83, it was like I said before, like a family where everybody's together, we were pretty much very... It was very poor way of livin'. We all lived in one apartment, on 188 Norfolk Street, down here in Lower East Side. It was about ten of us. And we, our ways of eating or anything like that was, we used to, actually, you know, man on the street, you know, ask for change and stuff like that. We work together, we'd all bring back the money and we'd eat. It was a very poor lifestyle. We learned how to live as people together instead of like, individually breakin' up and like, bein' like, you know, selfish so we kinda learned like, it was sorta like a commune, you know something like, it was like a hippie commune but it was nothin' like a hippie commune. It was more of a harder commune, you know? I think we sound the way we sound like because we are a product of New York. If we would've been from anywhere else in the country, I don't think we woulda had that edge, and that element of danger created something great, something fantastic, something brutal, real, genuine and in your face that you can't recreate today. It was completely organic, there was no... There was nothing fake about it, and it could only happen 'cause we lived at that time. That era in New York City, those people, those bands... that's it. Good-looking 60-year-old right there. Thank you. I try my hardest. He makes me look good, he's a model, the kid, you know? -Can you take a picture? -Sure. -Good one. -Thanks. -Thank you very much. -Thank you. You know, I-I'll always be doing this. I knew from an early age I'd be doin' this. 'Cause I'm that kinda guy. Yeah, what else is there to do... for me, anyway? Well, I love it. 60 years old, got a mohawk. That's hard, that's true, that's grit. Yeah, in shape. Good. Feel good. Gonna play my guitar hard tonight. I might even put on a new strap. I-I-I realized that, like, uh, I wasn't, like, in step or the rest of society, let's say. But I always felt like, "Hey, I'm a normal guy." "I'm a regular guy, you know?" Punk and hardcore, then was like, new. It was totally different. It was no more the guy up there and you gotta, like... You know what I mean? It was real, it was down-to-earth. I felt that you could achieve it. You could do it. You know what I mean? You could be that guy. You know? And I say to myself, "Not only I could be that guy, I could do better than that guy. I could do it louder, I could do it faster, I could do it harder, and better. And that's what I did. Okay, who started the band? Which one of you started the bad? Come on. I did, I started the band. Oh! Ashamed to admit it. I started Agnostic Front about three years ago, uh... I wanted a band to speak of, uh, social unrest, uh, a lotta political aspects to it, uh... I, uh, wanted more than just the name of a band. I wanted a-a statement of some kind. You know, every time I say the name, it could mean something different. You know, like it could mean any socially and politically... It can also not mean the absolute truth. To be in doubt... To be in doubt, not meaning the absolute truth. Not knowing the absolute truth is what agnostic means. It could mean politically, socially religious. It could go anyway... A front meaning a... Your point of view, your stands your morals or whatever. So we all have a diff... Well, before Roger was in the band, I had other guys like John Watson... Raybeez, I had a bunch of guys in the band, you know? Then I got steady drummers and stuff like that and then I got Roger. Everybody, what I wanna see? What I wanna see right now... is a giant circle pit all the way back the way front. Let's do this. Giant circle pit! ♪ Are you friend or foe? ♪ ♪ Are you friend or foe? ♪ Roger was a bass player for The Psychos, and, uh, you know, they weren't too popular. I loved them, you know. Yeah, they weren't really doin' like, all that, you know, but Agnostic Front was, you know, kinda, you know, a staple of New York hardcore. Alright, all you videots out there. This next band is the crucial band from New York. The ones known of the name as Agnostic Front. We're illegal. Punked, scathed, black, white, everyone of us, hair, no hair, start doin' it. When I was approached to sing in Agnostic Front, that, that took some gettin' used to, and the reason I was approached, because I was a-a stage diver. I was that guy in the scene, in the pit, stage diving and that's who, how they pick guys. Here's the original United Blood. There were two versions, I wonder which... This has got everything in here. I don't know what this is. Oh, look at this. That's a young me. I can tell by the way I'm holdin' my mike. It-it was really young, because there was... I was insecure. I didn't know what to do. You know, I mean, I... I come from playin' bass. So somethin' thrown to, to sing and I just didn't know what to do, and one of the things I used to do is grab the mike like this and just... Go for it, you know? I always had somethin' to hide behind and it's hard to hide behind a little microphone, you know? Th-there was just a weird feeling, you know? Alright, let's go. I got the tape rollin'. Go? Okay. Fight, Last warning. Okay. We're gonna do Fight. You guys wanna keep doing Fight? It was like the A7 club for instance, you're on the floor with everybody else, you're singing everybody's around you goin' nuts. Who gives a shit? ♪ Fight fight fight fight fight me ♪ The main rules for Agnostic Front when I joined was just three simple rules, no girlfriends, shave their head and dance hard. That's it. Everything else didn't matter. Didn't even matter if you sang in the mike, you put the mike down, who gives a shit? Get in the pit while we're playing. On fire. Let's hear it, folks. Now, that was "Agnostic Front." Stay tuned for the launch. High And Mighty. Let's hear it for "Agnostic Front." Ah, this is my favorite photo right here. This is, uh, my guitar hero, ha, Vinnie Stigma. This is in Argentina, I remember it clearly, you know? I would always do that. Pick him up, during Crucified, I think. Pick him up, and, you know... I could do that back then, you know? Then he was still Skinny Vinnie. We used to call him "Skinny Guinea." -Look at him all ready. -Good. Beautiful. I didn't even see you come in. How are you? As long as you don't realize everything else? -Michael Jackson isn't... -Of course. He's doin' "Thriller." You saw that? He's doin' the "Thriller." Look at him. So, always through the years, I'd buy Vinnie his birthday cake, since '86, I think it was. This is a recent picture of him playing in Agnostic Front on tour, I think, in Germany? It just signifies the endurance of his human spirit to play rock and roll in his own way and so many people have been touched by that. -We're goin-- -How's the food, alright? Oh, you got a bit of lipstick on his face. -Alright. -Smile. Say "Cheese." Cheese. Gob-a-goal. I blinked. He taught me to believe in myself when I was a teenager. I loved the sound of Agnostic Front for it was real and raw... and riveting and expressed the anger that I felt about... indecencies in society and in mankind. Um, but also gave us hope and in unity in coming together and a family without, like, getting into your business, allowing people to be who they are, and that's right for some time. Just sign the back. Okay, here we go. Watch. One, two, three. See that marker's dry and it says "Happy birthday." That's fuckin' entertainment, motherfucker. Now, that's goin' on my wall. Sing it with me. ♪ Crucified ♪ ♪ Crucified for your sins ♪ ♪ Crucified ♪ ♪ Crucified for your sins ♪ ♪ Crucified ♪ ♪ Crucified for your sins ♪ ♪ Crucified ♪ ♪ Crucified for your sins ♪♪ I got into punk in the mid '70s or early '70s, whatever 'cause I didn't like the disco, th-that was a big thing, disco, you know, and I, uh, it wasn't my thing. And I was always a rock and roll guy. I was always in bands, I always liked guitar, you know, I was a big Jimi Hendrix fan and just bein a-a rebel. Hey, Mary, it's me, Vinnie. -Vinnie, I know you. -How are ya? You know, I was thinkin' of you the other day. -Yeah? Oh, you too. -You still got your band? Yeah, I still got the band. -Good, good. I'll see ya. -Alright, Mary. God bless. This used to be an ink factory. And, you know, like people, there was a lotta jobs here. And the jobs left, because they turned an ink factory into condos. Now, you get like a person livin' in this one big space takin' pictures of an egg on a chair. I mean, you know? Makes me wanna throw up. Oh, the problem I have, it used to be a neighborhood. Now, it's... Hey, Bobby! -What neighborhood? -How are ya? How you doin'? -What's goin' on? -Hey, Vinnots. He's talkin' about our old neighborhood. Yeah, I was talkin' about the neighborhood over there. -How you feelin'? Alright? -Yeah. -Good, you look good. -I'm 67 years old. I know Vinnie when he was a baby. Every Saturday and Sunday, we used to play stickball on the block. There used to be the cars on the block we used to get a hanger, and open up the cars and we push them down the block. -Yeah, yeah. -We played Spanish Harlem. We played with people from the other part of the neighborhood. And the whole neighborhood used to come down and bid on the Italian guys against the Spanish guys. Yeah, yeah. And the games used to be $2000, 1500-- Yeah, it was great. The tank was the homerun-- Tank was the homerun. Then he had one he hit the middle house in the street. And then not only that... Hey, hello, hey, here we are. Don't forget social club right over here. -We're gonna be there later. -Okay. -Goodbye, Cousin Vinnie. -Bobby. Thank you. Bye. They used to... Right over there. They used to have a bunch of... It was a tire store. And they... On Sundays, they used to have all these tires piled up, so when I was a kid, I used to get all the tires and throw all the tires in the street, and, like, clog traffic up. Heh! I don't believe I did these things. It was great. Ah, let me walk amongst the dead. There is a building here, my father owned the bar right here once. Too bad, he lost it, you know? This building collapsed, and well... he lost the bar years ago due to gambling. So I don't gamble. This whole thing was the, uh, like a one storey, you know. Wow. How did it collapse? -Fire. -Oh. They called fire one day and that was the end of that. -Oh. Wow-- -You know? -Anyway... -Your father went to gamble? Yeah, it's another story. Thank God, them, they liked my father. My dad, uh... Well, he was a union worker, he was a, a truck driver, him and my mother were married for many years. My father got mingled up in a little, you know, some mafia shit, you know? My family didn't like it, you know, because we don't wanna be involved. You know, but you got no choice, you know and you gotta keep your mouth shut, and you know, it-it made a wedge in my family, you know, between... loan sharks, the mafia, you know? I-i-it wouldn't have been a surprise if we, they would have found him dead somewhere in the trunk of a car. You know, because he-he-he lived that life. You know, it's not good for bein' a-a family man. You know what I mean? Alright, then you tap. See, that's what I'm missin'. I didn't see that thing over there. Then just tap whatever you want-- Is that tapped? That's already tapped, right? Then it's sent. They have that noise? That's the noise it makes if it sends a message. I guess I press this and it goes back to the screen. -Yeah, it's done. -Okay. -Kinda like text message. -Kinda. Yeah. -You'll get it eventually. -Yeah? -Yeah. -I hope so. I... I'll get it, don't worry, this way I could send you emails, you know, when I go to Europe. Yeah. This is something I really got to enjoy moving to Arizona, by the way. Never had a dishwasher. Now, I'm in New York City, a dishwasher? I didn't even know how to use it when I, when I first moved here. True story. When I first moved here. I-Is, you know, it was there in the apartment complex I was movin' to, so I was washin' dishes by hand and put 'em in there so they could... dry off. Just gettin' used to this life, man. We picked this place neutrally. She's from Colorado, I'm from New York, and, uh, we've known each other since 2002. We met at, we met at one of our shows, um, my wife still has the ticket stub and we were always friends staying in touch with each other. Coming from two relationships, we were, like, "Well, nobody wants to give into their spot," like, their territory, "Wait, you move in with me." "No, you move with me," 'cause you know how that is. And, uh, my wife was comin' here to finish her studies and, like, this is where I'll start. And from there we'll end up wherever we end up We'll go back to New York or Colorado and we ended up stayin' here, we started having babies. When I was a kid, I never had a routine like this because, um, you know it's funny, I don't remember any... any routines at all. If you scream, I can't talk to you. You know, leaving is hard, especially my son. Both my kids, both Havi and Desi, like, Havi didn't really bond to me till she was like, two. Because of me goin' away, this-this one didn't create some problem, you know, like goin' on tours, you know? I would come back and she would take two or three days to warm up to me, 'cause she was, like, "Who are you again?" you know? So that kinda bothered me a lot. Mary Taylor talkin' to you from the Cat Club in New York City for the Underground Cafe. I'm talking to you with Agnostic Front here and they tell... They're gonna tell us a little bit about their band and where they're from. Uh, New York City, New York. Basically, that's where we're based. Any future plans now? Um... we're goin' on tour tomorrow, actually. We just came back, from our second tour and we'll be goin' to Europe in December. It's a East Coast tour for now and then Europe in December like he said. What kind of band are you? -Uh, more like, uh, uh... -Uh-- You gotta come see us to really know what it's about. ♪ Power the anti-social being ♪ ♪ Human discharge ♪ ♪ A fascist regime ♪ ♪ Fighting in the street ♪ ♪ They gent who saved us all ♪ ♪ The anti-social and gonna fall ♪♪ I hate being sick on tour, man. Bein' sick on tour, I get up every night. I get up, I put a fuckin' smile on my face, and I play as hard as I can... and then what are you gonna do? You're there. Well, thank God, y-you know, y-y-you're not that sick that you can do it, you know? Well, right now, a few of us don't look too good. Yeah, well, a couple more days and, you know, we'll be home and then we'll get the punk rock bowling. You know, bein' on the road, there's no sick days, it doesn't exist, you know? Uh, at least not for our band. I know a lot of bands that do take Mondays and Tuesdays off and possibly Wednesdays, but they can, we can't, you know? This, this machine has to keep movin' to make all ends meet by the end of the... By the end of the day, you know. Unfortunately, no sick days. You go out there and you tough it up. That's okay, we-we've done it our whole lives, no big deal. Hi, you've reached the Miret's. We can't take your call right now. -Because we're swimming! -Because we're swimming! Please leave a message. Hey, babe, um, it's me. I just wanna tell you I love you and miss the kids. You know, it's... I-I know I was supposed to call you around 4:00, but, unfortunately, it's, I know it's late, you guys are probably in bed. Fucking club didn't have no internet. Typical shit. Felt sick. I don't feel good. Exhausted... And I feel super, super guilty myself, you know? You're... Like, I'm missin' our anniversary, you know? Even though I love what I do, but I'm not here, and... Sometimes I don't even know if it's worth it, you know? But, um... I think you understand me, I'm just... Rather be there, but... It is what it is. The show's been pretty good. Actually, more than pretty good. Who could ask for more, right? I love you. Miss you. Kisses to the babies. Buh-bye. Probably the single hardest part of my life has been leaving my immediate family, you know, it's always been the hardest thing. Um... Leaving my children at home... Or relationships, you know, relationships, I've been through a few. You know, it's, it's hard to keep both, um... As much as you wanna keep both and not until this last ten years, did-did I make a-a decision, a-a formal decision, a pretty strong decision that I really wanna make family work for me. 'Cause, um... I'm really lucky that I was still able to have such a great relationship with my daughter Nadia, I really am. Because, just think about it, when I was touring back then, we had no internet. We had nothing, I would, I would send a postcard. By the time it came back from Germany to her, I already came back. It was affecting her, I could see it, you know? I could feel it, and at the same time it was a horrible guilt on me. You know, it was just... I was a kid raising a kid. And I was leavin' all the time, goin' away all the time. You know, she turned out to be a-a-an amazing, remarkable 29-year-old, brilliant little girl, I mean, she's still in my eyes, my little girl. But it was hard. I, I fuckin' hated that band for a, a long time. Between just always being gone and I didn't have a real way to know he was thinking about me. He couldn't FaceTime me, he couldn't text me, he couldn't do all the things that he can do with the kids now, so they know. It was, it was this thing that while other people's parents were like, at home, I was like, "Oh, mine is gone for a few months." In middle school, people will start being, like, "Oh, that's so cool, your dad's in a band." And that was the first time I was like, "No, it's not. It's not cool." I think that when you're young, you think that the thing that someone spends the most time on is the thing that they care about most. And then I just kind of grew up a little bit. and I understood, like, it wasn't a position he ever really wanted to be in necessarily. Like, he loves the music he loves playing shows but he didn't wanna be away from me. And that's also something you can't process when you're younger either. Especially the way I was raised you do what you want. Back then m-myself and, and Nadia's mother, Amy, we... We're both in bands. We both travel. We're both doing our things. So, uh... it was normal. You know, I think with, this time around with my, with my wife and my kids I've got that really good blend where in the very early stages when, uh, Nadia was a little girl um, it was different. You know, I was also younger. And, um, and... It-it was all a whole different ball game. You know, I was out a lot, at the same time back home, out a lot, I was living completely different. Living in abandoned buildings, in vans, blah, blah, blah. But when she came around, w-we just lived in a squat, you know? Would you want Nadia to live the life that you lived? Um, actually I would love Nadia to live my life because Nadia's got the best parents she could ever have. She's been...Me and Amy, both are, like, down to Earth and we kinda, like, see life the way we should see and not like hidden, like, I wish my mom and my dad told me more about certain things. Well, I wish they cared more about, like, things, like we really care about what my daughter does. How her schooling, we really care about. We really care about what she eats and we care more. And I wish I was growin' up that way. You know, we were just growin' up ourselves... and here we go, we have a kid, too, so... What the hell, this is what we do this is who we are, this is what we like this is our passion, this is who we are and you just tagged along. You know? It is. You had a friend who did all these things. -Right? -In prison. Yeah, 'cause I had all these like, handkerchiefs with them on it. Yeah, I sent you handkerchiefs. -This... -I was so cute. This, you guys sent me. What the hell is that? I don't know. Your mom sent me that. -Oh, my God. -You were just a little girl. Hold that up in prison too. Goin' to prison was my fault. It really was because I was living this life thinking I cannot get caught doing anything, anything. I mean, going on the road buying guns, drugs, or anything, like, I felt like I couldn't be touched. And in my whole mind knowing that all this stuff was illegal, and never getting caught for anything. I don't know, I can't even explain it. And that's how my whole life was you know, like, at that point. And then, um... I got desperate, and my daughter was born a week into it, I didn't have anywhere for her to sleep. She was sleeping in a drawer. I felt like, "Oh, my God, that's my daughter. "She shouldn't be sleeping in a drawer. "She's my princess, I need to go get her a crib. I need to get everything you need for a kid." And panic, and I go and buy all that stuff then I started saying, "Well, I need money," you know, so, of course somebody said, "Well, you take this and bring it to here," and that's how I started, you know? I wasn't a drug dealer, I was a mule. But at the same time, I didn't think anything of it 'til I became incarcerated. I used to think just, "Me, me, me whatever" and I started saying, "Wow." How it was effecting my, my family. Nobody told my mother. My mother was the last to find out. And she found out, like, eight months later. Nobody wanted to tell her. And, um, watching my daughter just come to my visits and just watch her like, she wanted me to leave with her. And I couldn't. And everything started really sinkin' in like, alright... Forget about, it's not just about me look everybody, um, I have a affect or I'm hurting. This next song is dedicated to my daughter back home! Goes out to little Nadia. Also goes out to Amy. This is called With Time. Let's do it up like old New York City. Nice and slow till we get everybody here dancin'. It's weird because it's like, when you're blood, when you have blood family, it's, like, you can't pick your family. You know, you have to accept them for who they are and then, you know, w-when, you know, with friendship, it's, like... Well, you can, you, y-you can choose to not be friends with someone and be, like... You know, but... You know, they have a soul connection, man. And it's just, like, i-i-it forms like almost like a blood bond with them. It's, it's, it's, it's an interesting it's an interesting relationship and they pioneered this, this, this, this scene. You know what I mean? This... T-the New York faction, you know? And, uh, you know, they've changed a lot of people's lives, starting right here. ♪ Hardcore lives ♪ ♪ One two jumpstart ♪ I can't think of anyone else who was seven years old... on stage with Agnostic Front 1983. My little brother, Freddy, you know, seven years old, gave him the mic threw him out there, "Sing." They don't. ♪ Claim your justice it's your time ♪ ♪ Blind justice who am I? ♪ ♪ There's no justice it's your time ♪ ♪ Blind justice ♪ Freddy used to, he'd come with us everywhere, you know? Like, he was, like, the mascot. And, and I used to put him on my shoulders and play the guitar. I thought that was the hardest thing ever, havin' a little kid singin' and I'm on my shoulders, like... It was... That's what I love. That's the time I'd like to go back to. You know, my intentions were never to pass a torch or anything like that, you know? And I didn't know he was gonna follow my footsteps. My intentions were to get him away from... his destructive father, to be honest with you, you know? I wanted to bring him with me where I felt safe. You know, my brother was in more danger bein' at home with, with his father, than he was being with me in the streets of New York with criminals, drug addicts, thugs, you know? That's why I left home myself. Obviously there was some turmoil at home and stuff and I feel like Roger felt that and, you know... A lot of times, you know, removed me from certain situations to go be a part of his life and his lifestyle and what he was doing, and that was his way of like, "Hey, "I can spend time with my kid brother "who I don't get to see often and also, "you know, maybe give him a break from things that are going on, you know, back home, you know?" My step-father, you never know what mood he was in. You never know he'd come home, you never know, if he was bombed or what was goin' on. My mother was always working and I was always taking care of my siblings, you know? Well, you, you know my story is, is your classic you know, um, American immigrant story. You know what I mean, like I came from Cuba straight to, to America. Learned English here in this country. It wasn't, it wasn't an easy story, you know? Like, my mom, she was 19 years old, three kids. We had it rough the whole way. Every year I was in a different school, sometimes, two schools in a year 'cause we kept movin', and I realized we kept movin' because we couldn't pay the rent. So, we had to move to another place. I never had the chance to make friends so I didn't, I didn't bother. I didn't bother, like, why should I make friends with someone when I know I'm gonna be moving? It's just, like, okay, I'm gonna be packing I'm gonna be moving, and packing and moving and pack... So, why make friends, and I never had that till later on, and I went on my own, I... You know, when I discovered punk and hardcore, started listening to stuff and goin' to shows. That's it, then I knew I need to be with these people. These are, these are, like, genuine friends for life. And they have been genuine friends for life. I knew it. I just knew it. If I had to change anything in my life... If I had that chance, I w-would probably have to go to bein' that little boy again. Part of my life I remember is being in Cuba. I remember living in, in a nice two-storey home in Havana, by the beach, a white house. I remember a sheepdog. I remember all these things. And I remember being happy. There was a time, where e-everybody was anti-Castro and just wanted to leave. Just didn't wanna live under his regime. We left under I think it was something called Freedom Flights, it was some kind of a situation set up to get all the Cubans out of Cuba that they didn't wanna be under t-that regime, I guess. When I came to this country soon as I kinda remember... everything goin' downhill. There was violence, alcohol, drugs, you know? That's, that's basically it. My step-father, he knew my love for my real father whatever... And he just wanted to destroy that. I remember, my father once gave me a, a rabbit for my birthday, the next day, my step-father killed it and made us eat it. My father gave me some fish, I remember... And we had a little fish tank, and he just went and smashed the fish tank, and a fish just jumped lyin' the ground till it was dead. And I guess he wanted to prove his point. 'Cause it's not physical abuse when somebody takes a rabbit and kills it and feeds it to you. It was a mental thing. Then it started all like that, and eventually became physical. He became physical with my mother. Then he became physical with us and I would sit, I wouldn't understand why my mom would allow it. There were times when my mother jumped out of a moving car just to get away from him. She opened the door and j-jumped out. There was a time my mother checked herself into a mental institution for a good month, just to get away from it. But somehow, she always went back. I couldn't kinda get it. I think I took a lot of the abuse or the beatings myself because I wanted to protect my brothers and sisters. My own brother almost killed him a couple of times. Me, myself, I had to leave 'cause I was gonna kill him. And it was just like, when is this gonna stop when somebody actually does kill this person and someone's gonna go to jail or someone's gonna die. Sure as hell, my mother had reached her breaking point too, she just pulled out a gun, she shot him. She shot him a couple of times. And then, after she shot him a couple of times she went to go visit him in hospital. And he just sat there, scared to death. Talk about fear, that was, that was the last time, uh, they were together. And these were all things that I lived with and...what I got out of it was that you can become that same monster or you could choose to be a different person. And I chose to be a different person. Regardless of, of how dysfunctional one's family may be, you know, you always strive to... try to make it better. Make it better for yourself, you know, and obviously, most importantly, make it better for the future generation, your kids. I think he's the way he is because of our life growin' up. It was not easy. Uh, I think a lot of people who said "We weren't gonna make it, and we don't stand a chance." Well, here we are. It's just hard to believe that this is February, huh? It's so beautiful. Come on, buddy. He's human. He's just a guy. And there's a lot more to him than just...AF. AF is, it's a huge part of his identity, you know? It's, it's just ingrained in him. And I don't think that he really knows what else to do. We have people come up to us in random places, anywhere in the world and they tell Roger, tears streaming down their face, "You know, you really helped me." You just feel so grateful and you're just, like, "Wow." Wow, you really touched those people in their most vulnerable and painful places in their life, and you helped them survive. And you helped them get through it just through your music, just through what you love and what you care about, and I love that about him. And he does so much for so many people that they could never know unless the rug is pulled out from underneath him and he's gone or he stops. Then you're gonna feel, like, it'll be like, "Oh, fuck. You know, Roger really meant a lot to all of us." I don't know, he's just reached a certain age where he can't do this forever. If I could change one thing about my father... It would be to take care of himself because he overextends himself for people. And...doesn't do enough for himself. Yeah. Here we are. Grab your stuff. Well, are we ready to go? -You're not ready to go? -Yeah. I don't even know when, but it's been a few years now, um, R-Roger just started feeling dizzy. And then, one day... I think, we were going to get sushi or something, we were just driving, and all of a sudden he just broke into a sweat. And he let go of the steering wheel and he started screaming, "Babe, babe, babe, help me" and he was crying. And I freaked out and I grabbed the steering wheel and I, I yelled at him. "Put your foot on the brake." And I directed the car to the side of the road and I reached over through the car and parked and he was just literally tearing at, reaching for me with his eyes closed, just freaking out and I didn't know what the hell to do. And he just said, "I-I'm spinning, I'm spinning." And I immediately just jumped out of the car and I was trying to push him over to the passenger seat, but he was too big for me, I couldn't 'cause there was, like, a console in the middle. So I instead end up directing traffic out of the way so I can stay and try to figure out what the hell to do and I finally just called my doctor and she's like, "You need to take him to the ER right now. He may have had a heart attack." And we just looked at each other and we were, like, "What the fuck is happening?" The way, um, uh, we do it, is we make that neck and then, we dissect under the skin to put that device in. So, that dissection creates some tension that's gonna last for a couple of days and then will go away. But right now, today, you should not be having any pain in me pushing on it. -No, I don't. -Okay. And then you moving the arm is not... No, this is... I'm fine with it. Perfect. Now you feel it, right? -When you-- -Yeah. So it's sitting right there, it's watching your heart constantly, we're already receiving reports. -You're receiving... -There's nothing. There's no arrhythmia so far. So this is good. And this is gonna stay there for up to three years. And, um, if anything shows up, we'll call you right away. The heart has four chambers and these bottom chambers are called the ventricles. The top chambers, this, this one and this one are called the atrium. In your situation, this and this are very large. You know, we grade the enlargement between mild, moderate, severe. Your situation was severe enlargement of both atrium. The reason I wanted to do this because I wanna make sure that there is no arrhythmia that's causing these large, top chambers to be enlarged because I don't have any other answer. We looked at it, you know, we studied everything I don't have a good reason of why these top chambers are enlarged. So, the plan we'll see you, um, let's plan on... For now we're still... we still don't know what's wrong with him. He doesn't do drugs, he doesn't do... He doesn't drink, you know, like, all... None of it makes sense to anyone, to us, and those top chambers should be for a man who's six foot four, Roger's not, he's five foot nine. And, um, we, he tries to ignore it and he tries to just, um, keep focus on something else, "I gotta work, I gotta do this." We don't know what we're dealing with and we don't know why, so we just sort of take it day by day and... We really don't... There's a whole lot of, we don't know. But it's scary. I don't know, there's just a whole lot of worrying. He forgets to take care of himself and by the time something does come up I think he feels two things frustrated that he doesn't know where to start and afraid, you know, because... he doesn't wanna die, you know? I think that, he carries so much weight of a lot of different people in his life. Well, what would, what would happen to them, you know, if something happened to him? Well, I think if he would just, you know, not be, be so stress over everything. You know, he's doin' a million things. He's fixin' a car, he's fixin' the electricity h-he's puttin' up a fence, he's... The guy is constantly gotta be doing something. You know what I mean? He can't rest. You know what I mean? And I-I think if he would just chill more, it'll be better for him. Do you worry about him at all? I always worry about him... you know? He's his own worst enemy. Um... I don't know , man, like... You know, I think, I think three weeks is, is a, is a lot if you ask me, you know? But it's going out more than three weeks, twenty-four days max, you know, that's, that's all I can do, I wanna be back with my family... Roger is a complete control freak as long as he has control over the situation... I think it's kind of... It's all good. Then you, I mean, what do they thinking about? They don't want us to play here or they don't want us to play there but they wanna be exclusive... This is something that he has absolutely no control over. And I think that drives him even crazier. You know, you get this, you get that you get sick, I mean, everybody gets sick... I wanna bring J. I gotta bring Mosh. Mosh. You know Mosh? He's dealing with the heart... That's serious shit. Now, where are we flyin' to? Direct, right? Talk to Roger today? Nah, I talk to him I go through you, I ca, I ca... I text him and I says I'm with you. That's how he knows. Roger's, his, his heart that's a, that's a serious thing. Yeah...yeah. Uh... My name is Roger Miret. I'm 50 years old. Lead singer for Agnostic Front and I'm... Fuck. I'm just a, a normal human being. I'm just like you. And sometimes your voice when you need to say something and you can't. This is my mom. -Say hello. -Hello. Sometimes just so humanitarian that's really all I want from life. I don't, I don't want any other type of success. All I ever wanted since I was a kid was just, just to be heard. Screaming for a change, I'm screaming to be heard. I think I've said a lot of the stuff I wanted to say, but... It takes about a minute to operate... If I'm cut short right now I don't feel like I've said everything I had to say. I feel like the feature is still isn't written, you know? -What's up, Freddy? -See that? There you go. Oh, what's up, brother? -How are you? -How's everything? -What's going on there? -What's going on? I just gotta register. -What's up, guys? -Hi. I could stop doin' what I'm doin' if I wanted to. But...I don't want to. This song is called United And Strong. In other words, it's unite. If we all unite, we'd be stronger. With no sense of fight among each other. Love the whole fucking world out there that hates us, man. So, that's all, stick together, we unite. We fight them. That's what it's all about, man. That's what hardcore's all about that what I got into music for. I'm tired of all this fuckin' people putting us down, man. Stick together, we can do it the right way. Alright? this song's called... Hardcore is definitely something that's been very misunderstood. It was really, it was really a call for justice you know what I mean, it was really questioning authority, questioning society questioning religion, just a call for justice, that's what it's always been to me. You could say it's turned into a lifestyle but that is a misjudgment too 'cause Adidas is a lifestyle, you know? I've always said that to me it's just a good judgement of who you are. If you can stand in front of that mirror and look at yourself and feel honest and genuine with yourself, then, to me, that's being what I like to grasp as hardcore like, genuine and real passion, you know? When I got more involved within the hardcore communities obviously, in the early stages and, um, I found people that I-I felt we were just like me, misfits, outcasts, rebels, you know? Everything that screamed me and I, it was so great to finally find people that I felt, I could be a part of and, and, and it was just good It felt like I found home, you know? Okay. Franny! Alright, this is for Franny. -Franny! -Franny! Say hello to the camera, Franny. Hello, Franny. Yo, this is Franny. Take a picture of me and Franny. -Yay. -Yay. Franny style. You ready? You can strap on the headphones and feel like somebody knew where you were comin' from, you know? You didn't have to worry about it, you know? The first three Agnostic Front albums, I'd sit on my mom's back porch, you know, tryin' to figure life out and shit, you know? And it was this reality, it felt, you know, like, these motherfuckers knew what was going on, and I didn't feel so alone, you know? And I was, like, goddamn 12 or 13, you know what I mean? That's, that's truth. It's all about honesty and truth, you know? Be real. Do what you do. And be who you are. You can't really lose on that end, can you? Like, at all. Victim In Pain. Public Assistance. Police Violence. Tonight's the first night with my implant... and I'm sure when I hit the stage I'm just gonna become who I, who I normally become but I need to, like, coast, I need to coast into a comfort level. I've been nervous ever since I found out I had that bullshit little heart attack... I've been worr... I'm nervous. -Whenever you're ready. -I'm gonna go up, uh... That's like a new thing I have now it's fucking with my head. It's a little scary. Maybe I am playing Russian roulette, maybe I'm not, but... you know, I've always said, you know, do whatever you wanna do, and believe whatever you believe to do till its full intent, you know? Whatever that is. I've always said I want to do what I love to do till, till the day I die. Whatever that day is, if it's right there and then, that's what it is. Everybody out there is ready?
