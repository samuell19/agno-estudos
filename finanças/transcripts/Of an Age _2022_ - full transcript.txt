Downloaded from RARBG Hello? Ebony? Ebony's not home. Ebony's in Bali. Who is this? Nikola. Kol? Kol Dennick? Denic. You've grown up. You all right, love? Bit of a suss hour to be calling. I know. I was just thinking about her. Oh, darl, I-I... Uh, I wasn't thinking about her. It's... I'm sorry. Okay. Okay. Okay. Fuck. Fuck. Oh. Excuse me! Excuse me! Hi. Hi. Sorry. So sorry to bother you. Um, do you have 40 cents? - Do you have 40 cents? - Okay. Just 40 cents? - Thank you so much. - No worries. Thank you. Thank you! Okay. Okay. Fuck. Ladies and gentlemen, it's star time at the Apollo Theater. Everybody, the hardest-working man in show business. I said don't come in! It's your girlfriend. Don't take five hours. I'm downloading. What? What is it? What the fuck, Kol? I've been redialing for yonks. It's 'cause of the dial-up. Ivo's been logged in. What is it? Where are you? Please don't yell at me. Why would I yell at you? Ebony, where are you? I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? We were going to the beach, to this guy's dad's boat, and-and this guy, he was gonna get the boat, and, um, Tari had some speed, but I-I only took, like, the teensiest, tiniest, like... like not even a full line, like a half... like a half line, like a hyphen. I was fine. I remember I was, like, chill, and he was gonna go get the boat, this guy from Saint Basil. Guy from where? - I fucking swear... - I can't hear you. Saint Basil. Saint Basil. His dad had a boat. Listen, please. And he was a bit... a bit grabby, baby, but not, like, sleaze-o, so... so I was like, "Yeah, okay," like... Like, I mean, I was practically a nun through schoolies, and Wansajah and Tari were complete sluts... Did you have breakfast? It'll get cold... I understand literally nothing of what you're saying to me. I know. I know. I just... I don't want you to think he was this total rando. And, yeah, okay, he was a bit older, but he wasn't, like, old. Like, he was... he was on his P's, so it's just... we couldn't find his dad's boat, and we were at the beach, and then, um... and then I don't remember. Ebony, you are not cohesing. I don't know what to do. Tell me what you want me to do. I know. I know. I just... My bag's gone and... my shoes. One of them's gone, too. And... Kol, my dress for the Civic Centre, it's at Tari's, it's at Tari's. You have to come get me, Kol. You have to come get me. I have to come get you? I have to be at the Civic Centre. In less than like two hours, like you do. Oh, my God, Kol, are you even, like, listening? I don't know where I am. You have to go to Tari's, you have to get my dress, and then you have to come get me. Like, do you understand? There's no time. We'll have to drive straight there. Straight there. How am I gonna come get you?! I don't know! Like, your mum and stuff. Get her to give us a lift. My mum's just come home from a night shift. She won't want to drive to... Wait. Where in Christ's hell even are you? - What's the name of the beach? - I need the Internet! Fuck off! What? Isn't there a sign? What's the name of the beach? There's a street sign. There's a street sign. Get the Melway's. There's a street sign. - I'm on Allenby Street. - Ellenby? Allenby, you idiot! Hurry up! Allenby Street. Allenby Street. A-L-L. Oh, my God, Kol, I'm, like, so cold. There's an Allenby Street in Reservoir, one in Canterbury, one in Altona, one in Coburg. Which one? Which one has a beach? Maybe Altona? But that's like ages away. Yeah, well, it must be one of the others, then. So ask someone. There's no one around. And stop yelling at me. There must be someone. Just hang on a second! Fucking hell. Okay. Don't hang up, okay? I forgot to wash your clothes again? It's the finals... Year 12 finals... I'm dancing... My handsome man. Altona. I'm in Altona. Kol, are you there? I'm in Altona. Come get me. Hello! Fucking come how, Ebony? Stop yelling at me! I think we need to call your mum. - Altona's an hour away. - Don't you dare. Don't you bloody dare, Kol Denic. Don't you dare, Kol Denic, I swear to God! Ebony, it's seven fucking thirty-five a.m. I need to dress. You need to dress. Look, we'll think of something to say. You call my mum, I'm never fucking dancing ever again. Not today at the Civic Centre, not anywhere ever! I don't see how else we make it. -Don't you dare, Kol Denic. What? -I don't see how else we make it, Ebony! Okay, who do you know? Who do you know? You're not being very helpful. Who do you know? I don't know anyone else's number by heart. This is not happening. This is not happening. There's got to be someone with a car. If they have a car, they probably have a life. Duh! Asshole. Oh, hang on. Hang on. I know someone who doesn't. Who? - You still there? - Shh! Can you please let me concentrate? Okay. Okay. Here's what you're gonna do. Listening? Tari! She's asleep! You're Tari's sister, yeah? Yeah, Romeo. She's asleep. Here, take it. You talk. Hello? Hi. Um, is Adam home? - Yeah, just one sec. - Thank you. See, what was so hard about it? Their mum knows my voice. She has to think it'd be someone else. - Hello? - Hey, um, Adam, yeah? - Yeah. - Um, it's, uh, Jaya. - Who? Uh, apparently, we went to, uh, Watsonia High together. Um, I don't really know what's, like, going on, but apparently there's something up with your sister, and, um, well, this gay kid just rocked up at my house, and I'll just give it to him so he can explain it to you better. I'm not actually gay, actually. Anyway, I don't know what that has to do with anything. - Uh, hi. Uh, Adam? - Hi. Uh, it's Nikola here. It's Kol here. Um, we kind of sort of met at Ebony's Macbeth thing, kind of. Anyway, just say nothing to your mum, okay? Just act like everything's super chill. But your sister and me, we're in deep shit. Where am I going? Where am I going? I don't know where I'm going. - Which room? - It's that one. Hey, hey, hey. Tari. Tari, Tari. Oh, my God. Tari. Shit. Dude. Is that Ebony's? That-that... That's Ebony's. Shit. Dude. Hey. Relax, dude. Where's the dress? - The dress! - I don't know, man. Just chill. - Burgundy. - Just take a moment. - With fringes. - It's fine. Do you see any burgundy with fringes? - - Shit. - No, I don't. Yes. Oh, my God. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. Mm, we never saw him with anyone. He got voted the most likely to bomb the school. Mm. That's a category you voted on? Of course it is. But like three of my friends tried to fuck him. I tried to fuck him, too. Watsonia High, man. Slim bloody pickings. That's all I can say. Adam? Adam. Thank you, Jaya. Jaya, thank you, okay? - Just chill, man. - I owe you, like, my firstborn. Thanks so much. Thank you. Hi. I'm Kol. You're literally saving my life. So, where... where am I going? Um, go... go left on Grimshaw, and then-then I'll... I'm not sure if maybe... Uh, maybe... I'm not sure if this is the way to... Um... - What? What is it? - I can't... I can't tell... It's-it's just... I-I can't tell if... I can't tell if maybe this... Is this Grimshaw? It's just, I'm-I'm... I don't think this is the... What? What is it? Spit it out. What's the way to get to Altona and then... and then back to the Civic Centre by-by 9:00... 8:45? Uh, 9:00. 9:00 is fine. I would say by helicopter. Maybe there's a different road, though. There's quite a few different... -In one hour? Unless we are literally flying, we're gonna be lucky to make it to Altona at all, much less there and back. There's quite a few different roads. -If I was you, I would reschedule your emergency dance lesson. It's not a lesson. It's the fucking finals. It's the finals. - What are you doing? - Stop-stop the... stop the... What the fuck? I'm sorry. Sorry, mate, it's not... It's not you... entirely. It's just... a bit of a weird day for me. - It's okay. - Hmm? It's nice music. It's Argentinian? Yeah, some of it. It's from a... from a movie. When are you flying? Tomorrow. At 1:00. That's right. Ebony mentioned. Yeah. There's always next year, right? Like, next year's finals? Your sister's applied to all these unis in Sydney. She won't be here. What, NIDA? Ebony get into NIDA? Did we see the same play? Ebony's gonna get into NIDA, y-you think? "Out, damn spot. Out." That's mean. Yeah, but, I mean, if that's your main obstacle... Right?... Ebony getting into the National Dramatic Institute of Cate Blanchetts... hold on to your leotard. It's tobacco. What else would it be? - I-I mean, I don't smoke. - Mm. Sorry. I know what else it would be. But you're a good boy. That's okay. Being a good boy. Good boys make it out. The book I'm reading, actually... Hmm? It's by an Argentinian. "Bor-geez." Borges? - What? - Yeah. You go to school with my sister, and you're reading Borges? I went to school with your sister. -Ah, right. Went. - We finished. - Been hours now, hey. You're graduates. Are you jaded yet? - You're jaded. - Shut up. Borges, though? You're like 11. I'm 18 in like three weeks. Asshole. Three weeks. What's that? That's New Year's... - New Year's Eve? - New Year's Day. New Year's Day. Hello. - Apocalypse day. - Uh-huh. Mm. Better not be standing next to a computer. I'll be standing next to a Malbec. What about you? Next to three drunk uncles, probably. - In Sarajevo. - Jesus. - For real? - My cousin's getting married. We haven't been back since we left, so... You're not, like, scared you might die? I guess. I might slit my veins from boredom. You've got a flair for the dramatic, don't you? Is this actually a dance costume, or is this just what a trip to the servo looks like for you? Shut up. - What's the movie? - Hmm? The movie. Oh, it's from, uh, Happy Together. I haven't seen it. Yeah, well, technically, I wouldn't have expected you to have. But then here you are, reading Borges and... holidaying in Bosnia. Sporting some serious cleavage. So... I'm out. I am out. Is it any good? The movie. It made me want to move to Buenos Aires. I'll check it out. I like movies from countries I haven't visited. So, was it the war that brought you guys here? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah? The war. We don't have no bread. We don't have no water. Tears we have only to drink. Tears. Dickhead. Okay, so it wasn't the war, then. - We moved in '91. Oh. My dad was an engineer. So, what's he doing now? Is he driving taxis? No. Now he's dead. Fuck. Yeah. Well... I'm really sorry. Oh, it's-it's, like, so fine. I swear. Yeah. It's been like five years. More. I'm just waiting for my uncle to die now. We live in his house. - Is he sick? - No. Just... psycho. So, would be good to get rid of him. Huh? You want me to kill someone in return? Strangers on a Train. It's also a good movie. You're one fucked-up unit, aren't you? - Just a little. I approve. I think. Was it really the movie that made you want to move? You know I do actually have a postgrad in linguistics, right? - Oh. - And a major in Spanish. You went to Melbourne Uni, yeah? Yeah. Does that mean you were a good boy yourself? - In high school? - Uh... I don't know that that quite describes me. Jaya said you were, like, this lone wolf terrorist. Yeah, it probably had something to do with the fact that I, uh, never made eye contact with humans. Or the trouble I had sort of arranging my face into expressions that were considered warm. Or friendly. Just non-murderous, really. Or, for that matter, just connected to things I actually felt. I can at least look forward to uni, right? Compared to high school. Compared to Bogan High, yeah, you can look forward to a kidney stone. I put down Melbourne Uni as my first preference. Behavioral science. Yeah, you'll be fine. You're obviously a smart kid. I used to be a smart kid. When you get to uni, suddenly everyone's a fucking smart kid. Why'd you choose Spanish? Honest truth? South Americans. They're just hotter. - Yeah? - Mm. Oh, yeah. Totally, like what's-her-name. Gisele. Mm. Do you have something else? Hmm? Yeah, there should be some stuff back there. Should be a whole box. What's all this? Just all my ex's stuff. Wound up at my place by mistake. - Your ex was French? - Macedonian. And she liked French music? Look, you got a bakery. That's not my spelling. I'm K-O-L. Ebony helped me come up with it, actually. Oh. Romantic. K-O-L. Kol. Wow. Josef K. Moved up in life. Opened a meatworks. Kafka? You read Kafka? What the fuck am I saying? Of course you read Kafka. What, did you read The Castle? The Trial. Oh. - Did you like it? - Yeah. - Yeah? - I got a lot out of it. Favorite book. Great Expectations. - Yours? - Under the Volcano. I haven't read it. I'm stunned. I was expecting an essay. Boom. The Esplanade. "Boom. The Esplanade." Shut up. Just drive along the beach and look for an Allenby Street. And a phone booth. Did you promise Jaya your firstborn, K-O-L Kol? - Just K-O-L. - What do I get? - The next five. - Wow. Better get busy. Stop reading all those books. You'll have no trouble with that outfit on. You'll start pumping them out. I'll get right to it. I hope so. - Allenby. Allenby. - Allenby. - Allenby, Allenby. - Shut up. Phone booth. Is that... Oh, my gosh. Hey! - Wake up, princess! - She's dead. Look at her. Your Macedonian ex is gonna kill me. Oh, chill. He won't. Took you bloody long enough. Yeah, you're fucking welcome, you dero. I'll take this. Give us some aircon. Should've dialed Mum if you wanted aircon. Going a different route back. Just keep an eye. Yeah, cool. No problem, bro. Yeah? Yeah, too easy. Sweet. Let's do it. - Yeah, man. - Just... Kororoit Creek. Geelong Road, Dynon. Mad as. Done. Cheers, bro. Fuck this. Can we get a burger or something? I'm fucking starving. So, Kol, you got a girlfriend? No. You like my sister... is that it? Ew. Ew. No. I mean, like, she's hot as... duh... But... but we're more like really good friends. Yeah, yeah, I'm, uh... I'm not his type. Who's your type? I don't know. Someone who reads a book. Someone who's read Borges? What? I'll accept Kafka. Oh, my God, of course you dudes love each other, you fucking nerdoids. Hey, Eb? What? You want to try to swing past the Civic Centre? They'd be ready to announce the winners right about now. We could go peek in. Just... clap. Oh, my fucking God, Nikola. You're such a bloody drama queen. Like, we missed one pissy gaybo dance competition. Like, so the hell what? So the hell what? Like, who the hell cares? What are you gonna do now? Like, crack the shits? God. Like, there's more important things in life. Like, I think you should probably be a bit more mature and, like, grow up, maybe. That is not Lady Macbeth calling the kettle a drama queen, Nikola. Are you fucking dead set? Suck my dick, homo. Oof! Oof! Watch out, NIDA. Oh, my God, unsex me, like, here, you gaybo spirits. Fuck off, Adam. And fill me, like, from the crown full-on to the toe. Seriously. Adam, I'm serious. Cut it out. Top-full of the, like, I'm thinking, what's your direst cruelty? She did so well, huh? You did so well in that role, Ebony. I'm so proud of you. Oh, my God, out, you fag spot! Out! Get, like, off of me! What? Ebony! Are you for real? Eb! Where are you even going? Eb! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, you're not. - You guys were right. - I'm sorry. You're a grouse actress. Everyone says so. - No, they don't. - Yeah, they do. You're, like, the next Nicole Kidman. She's fucking trash! All right, I know. She's trash. She's trash. You're-you're the next Cate Blanchett, Eb. - I didn't get in. - Of course you'll get in. No, you're not listening. I got the letter yesterday. I didn't get in. Well, fuck NIDA. Fuck 'em! They're cunts, and they're wrong. They're wrong. Fuck Cate Blanchett, too. You're way better. I love you. Idiot. Come back to the car. Fucking car. Fucking Adam. He's just fucking... like, so nervous, so me and Kol thought we'd have like one drink, just, like, ease the nerves and stuff. And then, like, Mum, seriously, I don't even know what happened after that. Like, we literally fell asleep, and we slept in this morning. Like, I know, I know. It's... Oh, my God! Yeah, well, you never fucking believe me anyway, so, like, I don't know... I don't know why I expected different from you. Oh, my God. Yeah, we had drinks 'cause we were so nervous. Because it's the finals. Yeah, and then we slept in, and, like, I don't even know what happened after that. Like, literally, oh, my God, Mum, when we woke up, we, like, freaked out. I swear. Wait! Wait, you're actually insane. Like, you're actually insane, and I can't fucking stand it. Yeah, I'm not... No, not engaging. Not engaging. How'd Fay take it? Just drive. 51. When did Greensborough get so full of wogs? - Jesus. - I know, right? Actually, um, you should call your mum about the Civic Centre. Oh, she wasn't coming today. It's a shame she doesn't, like, support you. She works three jobs. We're a planet away from the people she loves. I'd call that supporting me. 53. - Sorry. - See ya. 49. 49. Donegal. Adam Donegal. Mate. You don't recognize me? Travis Mellor. Where have you been hiding? What? Who, me? I meant your brother. But hi. I'm Mellor. Hi. I'm Ebony. Didn't recognize you. No shit. I've been working out. Oh, okay. I don't think that's why. Are you coming later? Coming where? BoonDog's 21st. Boon-Dog? What's a Boon-Dog? "What's a Boon-Dog?" This guy. School together for six years, and now he's all like... I don't know. Too good for us? Yeah. Yeah, don't think any of us want to remember Watsonia High. Fucking oath. Mm. Hey, you might know Boon-Dog's sister. I mean fiancée. Oh. - Coral. Yeah. - Coral Birch? - It's at their house, the party. - Oh. Hey, you should come. Oh, mad as. We should. We should! She's, like, right up the road from Tari's, behind the, um, Video Ezy, yeah? - Yeah, behind the Video Ezy. - Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my God, we should. Yeah. Um, is it, like, themed or... It's bring your own STD. Uh... Yeah, yeah, nah, nah. I don't know, not a very creative bunch, um... Hmm? I don't know. You should just wear what you're wearing. Oh. Yeah, sick as. Yeah. -Right, so we'll see you tonight. In the house. Righto. Catch you later, Donegal. - Catch youse then. - See ya. Bye. Sick as, bro. In the house. Coral Birch is a fucking mole, but... we're going to that party. No, you're not. Excuse me. I was invited. Yeah, well, I'm not. Well, I'm not. My name's Adam, and I'm a loser. I love you. Come on. Go. Oh. Hi. Fay. Hi. How are you? Dining room. Now. Good to see you. Do you understand what it takes? - All of this? - Shh. Do you understand what it takes? I don't understand what I've done. - I do not understand what I've done. Nights out with boys is the story. I was... I was not out with boys. I was with Kol. Kol is not boys. Do you know what I have to go through - to contribute to this house? - What about what I contribute to this household? What about that? You're actually so disrespectful. I turn up at the Civic Centre, and they say you're not there. What am I... what am I meant to think? I was with Kol! Oh, my God, okay, you're really pissing me off. All night? -EBONY: Like, I'm actually about to lose it, so, like, can you stop, like, hovering around me, and maybe you just take a big step back. - Excuse me. - I can't believe that. - And then you just go on. That's not the case. Oh, my God! Look, it's not. - So I'm grounded? - Surely that's your obligation. The money I spent on those dancing classes! That wasn't my fault! That was not my fault. Hey. Hey. Oh, sorry. I think my sister wants her room back. - Shit. - That's okay. - I'm so sorry. - We're all good. You hungry? What time is it? It's dinnertime. Think you're gonna need another shirt, though. Wha... What's going on? Uh, it's my going-away dinner. Come on. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm okay. You can wear this and this. ♪ But I still can't believe... ♪ Who's this? Tori Amos. Is she one of those gay divas? No. She fucks men. No, I mean... like, you know, Madonna or, like, Barbra Streisand or whatever. Tori Amos is definitely not Barbra Streisand. Okay. Sorry. No, it's okay. Hey, just so you know... I'm open-minded. Like, it's totally okay. To be gay, you know. What? No, nothing. Is it on Napster? What's the album? It's not an album. It's a B side. Cool. Here. T-shirts I was gonna throw out. Thanks. Come on. 23. Just up ahead. When did you drop off the tapes? When you were... sleeping, beauty. Just, you can keep it. Goran's not gonna miss it. He, uh... He was a Goran? Ugh. He was a... He was an architect. But, yeah, he was a Goran. It's my cousin's name. Really? Is he Maco? Serbian. Right. I'm three things. Serbian, Bosnian, Yugoslav. Yugoslav? How does that even work? Think I'm gonna lay out my political vicissitudes in like 45 seconds? Vicissitudes! Vicissitudes. Do you look up the big words in the dictionary and then you practice saying them in front of the mirror? - No. - Yeah, you do. You do, don't you? Vicissitudes. All right. Mr. Nikola Denic. It's been fascinating. Been a pleasure. You maybe have, like, email or something? Mm. It's, uh... "why can't Adam read" at Hotmail. I'll get, um, Ebony to pass it on. I doubt there's gonna be any dial-up where I'm living, though. Oh, okay. Yeah. Well... It was really nice to... meet you. I guess. I know. Not "I guess." Yeah. And, uh... have a safe and... you know, cool PhD. And, uh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Bye. Ah, here's Kolya. Come, darl. Come grab a roll. There he is! I just ate, I was in a restaurant. Just in time for the soccer! Aw he's never been much for the soccer. Even when tiny... Always quiet in his corner, with his books, his picture books... He was a boy then. Should be a man now. You wanna be careful. Too many books and well, you know how it goes. Try tell his donkey-headed mum upstairs. - Leave him alone. But look at him. What's with the get-up? Getting a bit up ourselves, are we? We went to a restaurant too. The winter just gone. - And it was nice? - So-so. For those pr-... It's good for a man's blood, a bit of soccer. - You can see he needs it, man! - Sit here, bud! - Be right back. Hey. I need this okay? Did you buy this shirt? Long story. How'd we go at the dance? What, what, what, what is it? It's Ebony. What? What now? Thank fuck. I said you'd be in bed. I'm at Coral's. Come. - What? - Get off. What? - Aren't you grounded? - I snuck out, you dildo. What are they gonna do, ground me some more? See you in a bit. Coral. Someone's spewed on your doormat. Coral, hi. Uh, hi. I guess. Nikola. I was with you in home ec. Friends with Ebony. She's around, yeah? Eb? Oi, you dingbat! - Took you bloody long enough. - What? Oh, my God, Tari thinks she saw this cute guy somewhere in this bit, so I was, like, looking for him. Here I am. What? No. This, like, white guy. - Mm-hmm, here I am. - What? No. I meant, like, Aussie. Oh, so not, like, Nicaraguan. Let's look for him together, Kolly. How'd you sneak out? Adam covered for me. Please, bogans. Thank you. I swear, this guy that Tari saw, if it's the guy I think it is, it's gonna make up for, like, the year. Hey, actually, I think I'm gonna bail. -Fucking hell. Oh, my God!

Quick, quick, quick, quick! This is serious! Don't fucking touch me with your spastic fucking shoes. Oh, my... Okay. How you doing? Don't hit me, Adam. Fucking hell. It's okay. He's just... he's... Why are you in here? Hey! There we go! Very good. Very good. Nicely done. Yeah, well, it's good for mental health because what it does, it relaxes you. - It's true. - What do I do? Oh, my God, no way. "What do I do?" "What do I do?" You're the best. Is he? Yeah, the best. - The best? - He's so cute! I think this'll be perfect for him, for his mental health, for his clarity, for his well-being. He wants to know. Let's do it. Let's do it, baby. Go, Kol. All right, inhale. Go, Kolly. I don't think he's ever actually kissed a girl. Yeah. Never. Yowza! Oh! You good? Yeah, that's a bit dramatic. It's not working. It's not working? Excuse me, the weed isn't working? How's that Coral, don't you reckon? Who's that? Oh, haven't you met Coral? Oh, she's, like, this massive bitch, but she's actually kind of nice. - Oh, okay. Oh, yeah. - Actually, yeah, yeah. - I reckon you'd like her, yeah. - I don't know if I would. She sounds like a bitch. Spaz. Sorry. Coral. Sorry. I-Is, um... Is Adam here? Are you shitting me? It's-it's Ebony's brother. Get the fuck out of my house. Yeah, you tell him. Back to fucking "Czecho-souvlaki-a." The fuck you staring at, babe? You want me to get my fiancé? He'd love to smash your face. Fucking homo. Hey. I swear, I leave you alone for like five seconds. What are you doing? Jump in. I went to take a leak, and you were gone. - You all right? - Yeah. It was a grouse party, eh? What, are you kidding? I-I wouldn't know. I guess. 23. Where's Ebony? I imagine not asking herself where you are. You promise me one thing? That my sister, can you just... just cut her. First chance you get. I'm not being a dick. Yeah? You deserve better friends. Guy like you, much better. I love Ebony. Not, like, love-love, obviously. Just, like a friend, I mean. Fucking hell. I-I know she can be, like, a mess, but... deep down... I think she brought me out here tonight to-to say that she's sorry. She brought you out tonight 'cause I told her to call you. I don't really have any other... N-Not... not many other friends. Don't tell her I said that. S-Sorry. You probably just want to get to bed. Actually, I was gonna go for a drive. Can I come? Your sister never told me. About you. About me what? That I'm a linguist? No, that you're... You know. A sodomite? Were you, like, openly... In high school? What, at Watsonia High? Are you fucking kidding? Why? Did you have an openly gay guy the last couple years? No. Everyone was straight, then. What's that... It'd be 900 students. All upstanding heterosexuals? Every last one? I lied before. About Kafka. I did read The Trial, but... I could barely follow it. What about Borges? I'm trying. I don't really know what's going on most of the time. What about the Balkans? Was your mum actually born in Altona? The Balkan part was true. Alas. There anything else? That you've maybe been lying about? Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's okay. I'm okay. - Hmm? - I can come again. You will. You turned up for me. How long does a PhD take? Sorry. It's a dumb question. No, it's not a dumb question. At all. Can I walk you to your door? It's... It's my uncle and stuff. It's okay. You don't need to explain. It's fine. Oh, shit. Promise me you'll meet someone. Yeah? You beautiful boy. (By Rodrigo Leão playing) Easy. What are the odds, eh? We'd both be arriving right now? A few weeks ago, I would've said low. But in the middle of this Icelandic volcano apocalypse, I'd say pretty high. How many times your flight get canceled? Twice. What about you? They had me on a 22-hour, then a 26-hour, then finally a 42-hour. - So you were lucky. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. Mm-hmm. - Yeah. - I smell like it, too. - Yeah, I noticed. Oh, God. Melbourne, eh? You don't miss it? No. But it's home, alas. I remember growing up, I was convinced I'd travel the world. Have all these adventures. Just meet these mind-blowing people. Connect. Fuck. Sorry. What? What's it been, four minutes since we sat down? Already, Nikola's gone all wanks-istential. Yeah, but that's what's great about you. No, it's good. It's good it hasn't changed. Everything else has. I'm a bitter old man these days. Shut up. A twink called me gay-fat on Saturday. - What the fuck? Gay-fat? Apparently. Mm. You know, I wasn't gonna say anything, but... I was kind of thinking the same thing when I saw you at baggage claim. Change the subject, motherfucker. Tell me about you. Still in Buenos Aires? All I know is you're one of those übercool people who doesn't have a Facebook or Twitter or anything. No, I'm in Guatemala. - Of course you are. - Yeah. With an aid organization. The volcano canceled flights from Guatemala? No, I flew in from Switzerland. Yeah. I was up there for a conference. Fancy. They put us up in a $3,000-a-night ski resort so we could discuss ways on how to fix poor people. Did you fix them? Yeah. Yeah, all fixed. - Sure. - Yep. So you've been feeling filthy since the flight. I've been feeling filthy since Switzerland, so... What about you? What are you doing for pocket money? Public health research. At Bristol Uni. England. Mm-hmm. What? How are you still friends with my sister? Oh. I'm basically not. Don't think we've properly spoken in five, maybe six years. But you flew 37 hours... through volcanic ash for Ebony. Well... there's people here I haven't seen in ages, you know. It was a good chance. So, where are you staying? Your mum's? She's in Bendigo now. - Oh, yeah? - With my brother. Yeah, he has a job there. And a newborn. - Far out. - The whole shebang. - I'll be heading over. - Yeah. In a few days. So you're gonna stay at your uncle's till then? Good God, no. Those people don't talk to me anymore. They don't even talk to Mum. What happened? They found out I fuck boys. Bit of a deal breaker. So, where you staying? Bundoora Parkview. You didn't have to get a hotel. Ah, it's a ten-minute drive to the venue. Who gets married in a church? Who gets married? You're gonna come say hi, though, right? I'll drive you to the hotel. What? I'll just be in the way. Nah. Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. Not having it. You're coming. Adam. Hello. Oh, come in, come in, come in. Everybody's home. Oh, my God. Fantastic. Oh, my God, can you believe it? Hi, guys. How are you? Hi. How you doing? Come here, you. Oh, my God, you have... you have, like, muscles. Like, the SkyBus kind of makes me want to vomit. - I'm Rhiannon. - Nikola. Nikola. Bristol? Wait, where's Bristol again? I was born and raised here. Can't really break out of it. Just got to do my meditation... No. I don't think I could ever not live in Australia. Yeah? Yeah, I don't know. Your tag's on the bottom of your shoe. Adam, you and I are so having a dance together tonight. That's okay. Not happening. I'm not dancing. - You're gonna dance with me. - I'd ruin the wedding. - Come on. - No, no, no. Kol's the dancer. Kol? After a couple drinks, maybe. We're dancing tonight. Oh, Kolly, it was so sweet how you called after all these years. Sorry I was in Bali. Oh, that? I was so embarrassed. I totally mixed up the time zones. I got to say, I was a bit worried at the time. Yeah, Mum was like, "You've got to invite him to the wedding." Yeah, of course. Sorry, Fay. Such a good idea. I've just had a flashback. Remember picking him up from dance class? We'd turn up at his place, and he'd be out on the nature strip ten minutes early, freezing off his poor butt cheeks. Adorable. So, like, is everyone here gays tonight? 'Cause, like, a part of me legit hopes so. Really, Rhiannon? Shiraz? Maybe put the red wines down. I remember you now. Kol "Dennick." I remember you, too, Coral Birch. Well, it's, uh... it's Davidovich now. - You married a Serb? - Mm-hmm. Sure did. Ziveli. Ziveli? Is that how you say it? Put the red down, Rhiannon. Shockingly close. Ziveli. Ziveli! Maybe put the reds down for now while we're getting dressed and everything. And how about you, Kol? Are you hoping to get married? Well, got to at least wait till it's legal. Oh, Adam didn't wait. He just got married. He did? Yeah. Uh, New York, wasn't it? It was Toronto. Toronto. My husband's Canadian, not American. No way. Cool. Same diff. Yeah. Matt couldn't come, then? On business. Oh. On a business trip. Oh, too bad. Is, uh, what's-her-name coming? To the wedding? Tari? Who would invite her? Oh, ziveli! Careful. It's all good. -EBONY: Oh, my God, Rhiannon, I said... It's a T-shirt, all right? Calm your ovaries. Didn't I say? I-I'm so sorry. T-shirt? You got fucking red wine on his white shoes. Change in Ebony's room. It's upstairs. I was cheersing. It's fine. I was really... I was trying to... It's fine. Come on. - Take it to the dry cleaner. - Don't worry, it's fine. Un-fucking-believable. Uh, Kolly, babe, soz, yeah? It's all good. It's fine. I'm sorry about her. Remember which is which? Yeah. Yeah? Just move anything out of the way as well. - I need a stress-free zone, or I will freak out. So we're doing bubbles. Yeah, let's just do bubbles. -Bubbles. I'm just saying that between this photo and the contouring that's on my face... Hey, guys, I might run off just to check in, try to squeeze in a nap. I'll get the keys. I've ordered a cab. It's all good. - You what? - It's all good. - I've ordered a cab. - Well, un-order it, then. I'll drive... I'll drive you. I can't wait to see youse all there. Bye! Woo-hoo! You nearly done? No. To witness that I, Jacob Curtis Stewart... To witness that I, yep, Jacob Curtis Stewart... Take thee, Ebony Katrina Donegal... Take the Ebony Katrina Donegal... Bali for the honeymoon. Fantastic. Going to Kuta Beach. But they're in this gorgeous resort. Don't even have to leave the pool. Oh, my God, I'd so love to be with them. Well, no and yes, but you know. Hi. Jenny. Nikola. Just this morning? Really? You're-you're serious about that? - Plus, I'm such an idiot. - Mm. I was just here like three months ago. - Before I knew about the wedding. - I would've waited otherwise. - Oh. Me and my bank account are very much wrecked from these flights. But you came for Ebony.
