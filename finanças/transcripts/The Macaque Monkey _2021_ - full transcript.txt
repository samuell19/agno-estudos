Cut him down. He's still a kid. I can't do it! Hm? Hm? Who called me? It was you I just dreamed about. Who are you? I am you. I don't understand what you're saying. I didn't realize I was so dumb as a kid. To put it simply, I am what you were when you grew up. Hey hey hey, what are you crying about? What are you crying about? I never thought I'd be so ugly when I grew up Am I ugly? You... You say one more word, I promise you won't grow up, and I'll beat you to death with a stick. Stick... Where's my stick? What are you looking for? I'm looking for sticks. Do you understand? Is it this one? How is it possible. Dude, you're with someone else so soon? You don't talk nonsense. I have a very important mission to tell you about, and we're going to a place called the Little Three Thousand Worlds. Why do I have to go? How can I go if you don't go? Yeah, why can't you go yourself? I didn't realize you were so stupid and annoying. I'm telling you now, I only have one primordial spirit left, and I can't do anything without a vessel, so I need you. Eh, this stick does its own tricks. What are you sad about? Don't you think it's funny? I thought I was the only one. And now even the golden cudgel, it's knocked back. What's the place? Do you know your sin? And all the creatures of the world, who are in trouble with time, must go to the little three thousand worlds. Why do you want to put us in prison? I can't believe you... How dare you eat him? That's cruel! Now see clearly, right? Who said he ate me up? You just asked why you were put in this Pangu Heavenly Prison, and the reason is simple, because some of you have killed people, and some of you have set fire. You all deprived others of time, so You have to pay your debts, especially you Dark Bodhi, the female demon, the daughter of Pangu. I'm sure the name is true, so you can recognize it. Because I knew you would come. Pretending to be mysterious is my strong suit. When did you know that? 10,000 years ago. Are you fooling me? Hand over the Power of Time. Since you want it so badly, I'll show you the power of time. There is only one result to get the Power of Time, and that is death. I think you've lived too long and are tired of living. You can't have the Power of Time. You are not the female demon. Who the hell are you? Shut up. Who are you? I'm here to grab the Golden Cudgel. Can' t you see that? I'm a monkey. Oh. Got it. Have you played enough yet? It made me bounce and jump, and I actually grabbed a fake. Tell me, where's the golden cudgel? You just threw it away. Stinky monkey, how dare you fool me. How dare you. Where do you work? What's the name? I'm a little stone monkey. Seems like it. Little stone monkey, you're a monkey from Mount Huaguo, right? You are the last monkey of Sun Wukong. Hahaha. Little stone monkey. You're so good. The mean Sun Wukong, I have your monkey grandson. Give me the golden cudgel in person within a day, or I will proclaim your scandal to the world. Oops, I told you to help me scratch. Hey I'm on, I'm on, I'm there. Uh no more. Have you not had a bath in a long time? Have you eaten yet? I am you. Kiwi. OK. Hey, hey, hey. Morning. Where is this? You're just waking up now. Do you know that you slept for two days? I waited right here for you for two days. Aren't you being excessive? I'm tired. Shut up. I'm talking about Sun Wukong, it's been two days and still not come to redeem you, you Huaguo Mountain is really heartless and unrighteous. Monkey grandson is missing, the king is not looking for The king is not looking for it, and the monkey grandson is in no hurry, still sleeping. I'm hungry. Do you have anything to eat? You guys have the same virtues in Mount Huaguo. In the past, before creating the tremendous uproar in the heavenly palace you also went to the Peach Garden to eat and eat and eat enough. How come there are no bananas? Are you poor? I don't have any bananas here. I hate bananas in this life. What kind of monkey doesn't love bananas? I'm not a monkey. You're all hairy and you say you're not a monkey. You're just poor. To be honest, why kidnap me. Tell me, are you poor? Say it. Shut up. You hurry now and eat something, give you another day, before sunset Sun Wukong still does not come, I will eat your monkey brain. Why are you so mean? You can't become a monkey even if you eat my monkey brain. The little monkeys are so smart now. What are you still staring at? Come on, let's go. We still have a mission. How do we go? That weird guy is still waiting for you to save me. Do I still need to save you? I am you, and you are me. Big brother. But he won't. I don't care if he knows. Hurry up and go. You, what are you still doing? With a golden cudgel that turns into fossilized stone, and you, a clay Bodhisattva that turns into water, you will definitely not be able to complete the task, and the end is death. You... Oh dear. When I left from the Five Finger Mountain, to go with the master and them to the Western Paradise to get the scriptures, I do not know whether it will necessarily succeed, so I am not as stupid as you. You... Unless.... Unless what? Unless there can be awesome helpers. Brother, time is so tight, and this is a poor place, where do you want me to find helpers? I think there's one, far away and close at hand. The psycho? Do you know who he is? Hey. Okay. Let me tell you. You you you. Who are you? Why are you dressing up like me? Tell me, say. Sun Wukong, you're out of line. Don't you know who I am? Do you really not know who I am? How can you not know who I am? I don't care who you are. You're crazy. You' re crazy. You're the one who's crazy, aren't you? Do you know that I have one more change than the 72 changes? One more change. Sun Wukong, dare to compete with me? How would you like to compete? It's easy, just beat me in a fight. Fight fight fight. What fight? Fighting fist. Fighting fist. You lose. What? Rock-paper-scissors. Guessing is not boxing. Good. Again. Again. Ten. Five. You lose again. What? What fifteen twenty? Sun Wukong. I won two out of three games, and I want you to always remember that my name is Six-Eared Macaque You lost to me! You lost to me! Sun Wukong was defeated by me. Now you know what kind of a monkey he is. It turns out he's called a six-eared macaque. No wonder he likes to eat kiwis. No. I mean, he's psychotic. He's delusional. Never have anything to do with him. But to hear you say that, he did win you. Do you believe I'll beat you to death with a stick? Is it this one? My God, I'm afraid of you. I'll do whatever you want, as long as you're willing to go. Don't worry. We're going to make it. After all, I'm a stone monkey too Sun Wukong. It looks like the Monkey King is not coming. Little monkey, help me make a decision. Later on, should I cook you or boil you? Six-eared monster! Release the little stone monkey! Ouch. Stinky monkey. You're finally here. I've been waiting for today, so I can officially compete with you and see who is the real monkey king. You want to be the monkey king, I'll give it for you. No way. I'm just going to take it from you, including your golden cudgel. Then let's fight. If I lose, you get the golden cudgel. But if you lose, you also have to meet one of my requirements, go with us to a place. I'm not going to lose. Don't you always say that the difference between you and the Monkey King is a golden cudgel? Great King, you will use this stick of mine and hit him in the face. Wait. That… You. Start. Wait. Wait for what? Oops. Sun Wukong. Look at your face all dripping with sweat. Huh? You're still pissing yourself. Don't worry. I'll take care of the back. Where's Sun Wukong? He's afraid that you'll lose face. Go away first. Didn't Sun Wukong tell me to go with him to a place? I'll just take you there This fucking monkey, And I'm helping him with the kids. Aren't you a monkey too? Hey, hey, hey. How many times have I told you, I'm not a monkey. Pack your bags. I'll wait for you. Okay. Bet on it. I really owe you two in a previous life. You're not leaving yet? You don't even know how long you're going, You don't get any luggage. I' ve got enough for myself and my family. Are you leaving or not? Aren't you even going to say goodbye to your friends? You don't have any friends, do you? How come you don't have a friend in such a big Mount Huaguo? What do I need a friend for? They can play with you. I play with so many of myself, I don't know how much fun I'm having. But it's still you playing around. A monkey. Where is the gap of light? That's why you young people are told to read more, there are no secrets in the world long ago. All the secrets, the old ancestors have left word to us. Didn't you hear the old saying, "Time flies like a flash"? A flash is white horse. It tells you that you can find the white horse, you can find the gap of time, so that you read less. There's another saying from the ancients, a white horse is not a horse. What do you mean, a white horse is not a horse? It means… Hello. Hello. Isn't that the question you asked? I haven't even answered it yet. Is it okay to respect the monkey's feelings? Little monkey. Wake up. Here we are. Where is this? See for yourself. I don't know how to read. How come there's a line to get in the door? Only people who have disputes with the light of day can enter the Pangu Heavenly Prison. What's that one? It was a person who wasted his time. And what about this? That's a light deprived person too. And what about you? I'm the monkey with only a lot of light. Six ears and six lives. Handsome or not? Banana. Banana Banana. I want bananas. No more food. Go. There's no bananas at your place. I'm going to eat you up. Go on and get in line for me. How do you get there now? Still going? If I hadn't pulled you just in time. We don't even have the heel hair anymore. Did somebody not want us to go? So what do we do? Then I'm going to go. It's too dangerous. I'm not going. No way. Little monkey, take this with you so you won't be in danger. The master has been watching all day long. It hasn't even moved. Never saw the owner so alert. They must be very dangerous. Take the food to the side room. You. Stay. Keep a good eye on these two monkeys in the mirror. I warn you, these two monkeys in the mirror are dangerous and unusual, if you don't watch them well, I'll make you into, cosmetics. Little stone monkey, guess who doesn't want us to enter the Pangu Heavenly Prison? You know? The owner of the Pangu Heavenly Prison. The female drought. How does he know? I know much more than that. There's more. Do you want to hear it? Did you know that I'm related to the female demon. What kind of relationship? The relationship that cannot be described. Quickly. Say something. This is a private matter. It's not to be passed on. On a night when I couldn't see my fingers, the female drought, she sneaked into my room. So exciting Don't get excited. It's going to get more exciting. Let me out. Let me out. What spell is this? My six-ear skill.. Shifting Shadows. How did you know she'd get hit? The ancients have said that When you stare into the abyss, the abyss is also staring at you. I've known for a long time that someone was watching us. How else could I have been so accurate? We just got to the inn and it exploded. But it was only me who thought that. Sun Wukong wouldn't have thought of it. Even if he could think of it, he doesn't have six ears like I do. Great. Absolutely. Go. Go to find the power of time. When did I say anything about finding the power of time? Ta-da. Where did I say anything about the power of time? You heard wrong. I didn't even hear it with my six ears. So that's why The one with two ears is just useless. Poor, poor. When you stare into the abyss, the abyss gazes at you. The ancients have said that. Right? How do you know that? I also know that you must be able to use the shifting shadows.. Because that's the move you used back then, to deceive an innocent little girl. Oh. So you remember me. You're so ugly. It's hard not to remember. Instead of gazing at you every day, why don't I let you come in by yourself and save me the effort of getting a good night's sleep? Grab it. Six-eared macaque. You fooled them. Can you fool me? Ouch. Oops. How did you know about this ability of mine? About you. I know more than you do. You' re bragging. Found it again. I warned you. If you dare to run away again. I'll kiss... You're not going to kiss me, are you? It's killing you with my own hands. Then I kissed... I can't believe I can't search for anything. Let him get away again. Put him in the Heavenly Thunder and Earthly Fire prison. Yes. Stop playing dead, Sun Wukong. You are the female demon. How did you know that I was inside him? I also knew that you came here and just to get the power of time. Is it possible that you already know the will of God? Great. Give me the power of time, and let me go. No need to say more. I would never let that happen after that. How do you know what hasn't happened yet? Those who have experienced it, will naturally know. How can I experience it if it hasn't even happened? You certainly don't know. You only know that you can save the people and be a hero by getting the power of time, but do you know what the consequences of this are and who will suffer. This most painful consequence, do you know how serious this consequence is? You. Stop talking nonsense. Sun Wukong. If you behave yourself, there is still a way to live. But if you're still going to be the hero, then it's the little monkey that suffers. What are you doing? Just about to be relieved. We meet again. Come over again and she'll die. I didn't think you'd be afraid to die. Yeah, it's been a long time since I've experienced the thrill of death. Are you nuts? Who would find it exciting to die? It comes naturally when you've lived too long. You, who won't understand. Psycho. Where is the power of time? Take me. Why do you always have to be such a bitch? Don't pretend to know me very well. You don't understand anything about me. Little stone monkey. Now you know that You just keep on being the bullshit hero. Then it's the little stone monkey that suffers. This Heavenly Thunder and Earthly Fire prison is specially designed to deal with you. It will hit wherever your primordial spirit runs. I can't believe you're trying to be a hero I just don't like you ok? I like the way you can't stand me and can't fuck me up. I'll move What will you do with me? Try again again, again, again, again Do you dare to move again? Now you have nothing to say What did you say? What do you say I'd like to say You've been hit again. You actually replaced Monkey King's original god into my body Did you learn anything? The ancients said it's called self-inflicted I'm not helping you. Go! Quickly take the little monkey away Little stone monkey Little Stone Monkey Hey Hang in there I've gone to so much trouble but not to save a monkey I'm sorry Silly Promise me Don't be angry with me, okay? It's over, shit, shit Really blasted stupid it's a waste of food even if you save it Let you use a line shift The switch of Sun Wukong into the body of the female demon was agreed upon by Sun Wukong and me earlier That means Sun Wukong wanted to enter the female demon's body from the beginning Controlling her Then get the power of light and time You two monkeys are so bad I'm actually the Monkey King Sun Wukong is me I knew this one a long time ago I mean, I knew you two happened something. Now it's okay Sun Wukong gets ahead of me I'll never get the power of light and time You want the power of light and shade too? Does it matter now? What's important is that you two are lying to me together I also saved you I... I... I'm going to kill you Get out of the way. Help him! Do something to save him! You're heartless. So many years away Just back And it's causing so much trouble Are you still human? Do I look like a human being to you? You We'll talk about it later. Let's bring him back to life first Heavenly thunder and earthly fire Since they are more ruthless than we are and use such vicious tricks against a child So is there any chance of saving him? I'll just have to try to force the residual poison out of his system. Don't be angry with me ok I'm not mad at you anymore. Six ear Your son No Don't Don't no Don't No I've been gone for so many years This place is still so shabby You've had a hell of a time Cut the bullshit You think it's my first day knowing you You're back this time What are you trying to do? The Power of Time How dare you steal the power of creation from Pan Gu Do you want to die? The riches and the noble are sought in danger You have no sense of adventure. No wonder you stay in this shithole. Be a stateless person How's that? Do something big with me Don't do that not to be seen It's better than losing my life I've been gone for so many years Why are you still not in school? As the ancients said What is time Time is life The torments you suffered when you were taken into the Pangu Heavenly Prison was nothing more than a debt to time It's Me Now I'll give you a chance to split And then there will be time to spend And by then you two can get away with it if you want to You two can stay and be lords if you want to In short In a word The best for everyone is the best I didn't think you were meaner than a six ear. The old me actually worshipped you shit The old you I mean before I saw you If you give me the power of light and time I'll come out of you at once How about Sun Wukong I'm going to skin you You're a cruel woman. I haven't settled my score with you for the little stone monkey You think I'm cruel That's because you don't know what real cruelty is What the hell are you talking about? You are truly cruel for taking away the power of light and time You're a madman. Ok Since there's no way to reason with you then I'll do what I do with crazy people against you What the hell do you want to do Rest assured I won't pick your skin But I'll skin you for something else yes or no You don't have many more chances Sun Wukong Sun Wukong I'll take you there ok Wouldn't it have been better to say so? You're thinking too much Is there really the power of light in there or is it just another one of your traps? One Step to Heaven One Step to Hell Sun Wukong Whether you want to know the truth depends on whether you dare to take that step The world has gone to hell My original god is also about to disappear I've lost to the end What are you afraid of? Open the door What the hell do you want? Here is my light stream Sun Wukong Just take a good look with my eyes What kind of trick are you playing? It's not a trick This is what happens when you take the power of time when you take the power of time It is impossible to know what the future holds for anyone It's the future for you For me it's the past You brought the six ear macaque here to draw the wolf into the house The six ear of anger are riddled with corpses the power of time is in my hands I Am the king of this world Don't you dare lie to me You just don't want me to have the power of time It's up to you whether you believe it or not I have brought you to this void It's because it isolates everything including the six ear macaque's smooth ears Sun Wukong Are you trying to make a The false hero who sacrifices the whole world for self-righteousness or trying to be the one who can't finish the job but the loser who saved the people You choose go Six Ear How did you get out? You need to get some rest I have one last secret left to tell you Say Sun Wukong is not my dad Sun Wukong is me I am the Monkey King It's over, over, it's over So it's not cured Do you want me to feed you for the rest of your life? You get some rest Six Ear What's wrong again? Can you bring me one thing when you get back? Bananas, I know. It's kiwis. I find that kiwis are even better than bananas What monkey doesn't love bananas? You're so stupid Starting again Six ear You actually have feelings Anyway I'd like to believe that you're not too bad but you're going down the deep end It's come to this You're still obsessed Where did you get it?

It was brought over from where I came from Who the hell are you? Of course I am the female demon But am the female drought many, many years later Sun Wukong Things Have Come to a Head It's time for you to make a decision Do you still have the same palm? No more Sun Wukong You used me to mix you into the female demon body to take the power of light and darkness for yourself If I can do it, I'm not afraid to admit it Unlike you who makes excuses when you're caught out I really did believe you wrong I won't let you get away with it I'm the one who won't let you get away with it The Power of Time Ah Sun Wukong Scumbag Get the fuck out of here. How come it's you? You conspired with Sun Wukong to harm me do you see This is my real trick Stream of Time it can refract any memory in the brain and creat the illusion of light and time If you hadn't been so intent on getting the power of time how could you have been trapped Didn't your ancients say It's called self-inflicted What's this nonsense? Don't you just want revenge? Kill me! Do you really think I'm here to kill you? I've come to save you Will it hurt yes yes I can't Ouch, Ouch, Ouch fine fine ok You haven't changed in over a decade be not afraid to die Be afraid of pain That's too much We don't have more than ten years We only met as children I don't mean as a child Delusions of grandeur Neurosis I'm so much more normal than you If I wasn't a psychopath How could I have fallen in love with another psychopath It's not me you're talking about, is it?

Oops Did you always think this mark was a mockery? What else would it be? Can't you search someone's past? See for yourself Let go of my hand what are you doing to hurt Pain Don't worry, you won't be afraid with him Let him go What the hell have you done? Nothing.
