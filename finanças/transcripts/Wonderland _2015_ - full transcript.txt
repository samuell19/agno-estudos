WONDERLAND This is Radio Energy with the traffic news at 5:30 in the morning. Watch out on the A1 from Zurich to Sankt Gallen: Between Wil and Gossau, there are run away horses on the lane. Please don't feed them and drive carefully both ways. Where are you? - Almost on my way back. I haven't slept for one second. The little one is running a fever again. It's the teeth. And Mara woke up as well. - Shit. Screaming all night long. I'm going nuts. Two kids their age are just too much. Yes, I know. - Could you please call the real estate cow? - Sascha... Can you please call her again tomorrow? - I promise. Otherwise, all we have left is this damned suburban one-horse town. Our commute is too long then. - We'll talk later, okay? Yet another customer at this time? - I'm sorry. - Damn, Goran. Come on. Money is money. Ciao. - Okay. Bye bye. Airport. Okay. What's your problem, son of a bitch! What are they all doing there? Sleep, get up, work, eat... drink, talk, fuck, sleep. Always the same. Is that your wife? Yes. And how is it going? Huh? We miss out on each other. I go to bed when they're getting up. But it is what it is. That wouldn't be my cup of tea to always screw the same one. Plus the stress with the kids, I mean... They are cute but... They still shit. At least you're making sure we won't become extinct. So you scored 10 points. Let's see if anyone can beat that. Not bad. Not bad at all. Sandra. Hey Sandra, you want to try? - That's her. Come on. See, the next one is yours. I am here. 68 francs, please. Keep the change. I need a receipt please. I don't need your charity. In that case... - Goodbye. Yes, right. Piss off... I don't have a lighter. Thanks. It's our sins, oh Lord, for which you punish us! It's never too late to find faith! Faith in the good! Open your eyes! He will be coming soon! Oh, Switzerland! You Whore of Babylon! It could start raining any moment, you know? You want these pants? It's up to you. You want these? Well then, we'll take these, won't we? Yes... Turicum Insurances, Fischer. How can I help you? I just need your policy number real quick. What cloud are you talking about? I'm sorry, but we are unable to control the weather, aren't we? You're afraid it will tear your roof off? So in Central Switzerland as well? What's going on in Central Switzerland? They probably slept poorly as well. Full moon again? - No. Not until next week. - Foehn wind? Something is strange. Albrecht is taking the stairs again. - I need to go. So your appointment is at 10 o'clock. - With Tommasini? Exactly. And lunch at noon with Mrs... - ...with Mrs. Dupont. - That's right. Anything else? - Mr. Drinovac called twice already. Drinovac? - From the meteorology, he'll try again. Get me one of these, too. Damn! You owe me one franc. Fuck! - Two francs. Oh bloody fucking hell! Six francs. I'll give you one franc for each curse. Ten francs. Twenty francs. Twenty francs for one curse. Hey, what's up? - Where have you been? What's this hippie music? - Hey, I could smoke one of these on the special train. Did you hear about this cloud yet? "A mysterious cloud is covering parts of Central Switzerland and is growing." - What? Yes, look at this. No regular flight operation at the airport anymore. Are you kidding me? Guys, I tell you, today... I'll light one up today, too! Finally a little bit of action, man. Shit. Yes, exactly. Yes... "BSC Young Boys!" Guys, stick together. The Bernese are here again, drunk as every year. Que será, será. Que será, será. The Bernese are here again, drunk as every year. Que será, será... "BSC Young Boys!" Look at how they're gaping, the monkeys! What are you looking at? - What's up, man? "Thuner, Thuner! Off to the mountains! Oh, how nice to never see you again!" Family Weck? Nina, honey, it's me. The camera man and I are close to Lucerne. - Is that Mom? We really needed to prepare the recordings for tomorrow... What? - We'll meet up with a meteorologist. You may see a strange cloud when looking outside... Right now, nobody is able to tell us what exactly it is. That's why this meeting is so important. - Let me talk to her. Nina, can you hear me? And what are you going to do? I don't know yet whether or not I'll come home tonight. Okay. Stop it! Okay. - Take care of your sister. I'll call again. - Bye. - Bye! Alice, pack your things. We're going to sleep at the neighbors'. I wanted to talk to her, too! Damn, Alice, pack your bag! Alice? He's always on time... Mr. Albrecht should be here any minute. Come on, let's get started. Mr. President of the board of directors, ladies and gentlemen, I summoned this meeting because we'll file an application to the Federal Council. This cloud out there is only the beginning. Mr. Schulz... - Thank you very much. Our calculations are alarming. This cloud is expanding rapidly. It was discovered over Central Switzerland this morning covering an area of 1,537 m². 2 hours later, it was already three times as big. Nine times as big at 2:00 PM. Our measurements have shown that tire wind circulation speeds are rapidly increasing inside the cloud. This never before seen phenomenon of velocity acceleration can be ascribed to a shifting of the magnetic field that we have been observing for some time... - Mr. Schulz, excuse me, no details. - Well, we expect the cloud to further expand and to finally result in an enormous storm. And now in plain language: In the worst case, this storm will ruin the insurance industry. The weather induced damages will exceed everything Switzerland has ever seen. And the policy reserve by far won't be sufficient. Why don't we know about all this? - Because it cannot be. Hands up, come on, back there as well! Hands up. BSC Young Boys! What's going on? We'll stay calm and wait until the match continues. Hey you... If you want to go to kindergarten you better join the other ones. Why not set it off now? Now we'll turn on the light! Just shut up and join in! And now all shawls up. Come on. Come on everybody. Back there as well. All shawls up! I'll burn your name right into my heart! "I could swear I'll sing forever, if nothing interferes..." I'm saying: First, we need to minimize the risk. We better separate from all companies abroad. - Impossible. Do you have a better suggestion, Mrs. Dupont? - Please. Mr. Pfister, all this is pure speculation. We really mustn't take a risk. Yes, hence this application. In case of emergency, the Federal Council needs to have a survival package ready in order to save the insurance industry. Mrs. Hasler, go get Mr. Albrecht now. And not a single word to anyone. This is Dario Albrecht's voicemail. I am unavailable at the moment. Please leave a message... Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, the match cannot be finished. For safety reasons, the players are not allowed onto the field. We've never seen anything like this. This is a meteorological sensation... The cloud that was discovered yesterday did not enter Switzerland coming from abroad but originally formed inside Switzerland. We can only hope that the north wind arising over France and Italy will cause the cloud to disperse toward the Mediterranean. The Federal Office of Energy tells us that we need to expect occasional blackouts and breakdowns in public operations today as well. Please keep calm. Wait. Show me number two. Rewind. Stop. Stop. Play it back frame by frame. Stop. What are you doing? - It's enough, Madam. But that's my toilet paper. - Send them to the vegetable shelf, okay, fine. Only the two of you? I wanted five. There's a great demand today, you know. Make sure the store closes as quickly as possible. Yes, Sir. This is Dario Albrecht's voicemail. Unfortunately, I am currently unavailable... Fatime, do you know where Albrecht is? Mr. Albrecht? No idea. Nobody's seen him this morning. Come on, admit it. They're panicking because of this cloud. No, they're not panicking. They just urgently need Albrecht. Nothing's working today. My computer is constantly crashing, too. It's just a cloud. Two different ones... Doesn't matter, does it? Hm... "Temperatures: 13 to 16 degrees. In the afternoon: warm 24 to 25 degrees and a moderate breeze from northeast." But that's from Thursday. WHAT'S HEADING OUR WAY? Patrick, is that you? - Yes, Sir. Why are you still here? Hurry up! ...you are urged to avoid being outside with immediate effect, and go to the shelter assigned to you. Follow the instructions received by authorities and relief forces on site. You will find further information This is a warning issued by the Confederation. Within the upcoming 24 hours, all of Switzerland is expected to experience the beginning of a hurricane force storm. As of now, the highest danger level is in force. Beware of falling or flying objects, landslides, floodings and burstings of dams. You are urged to avoid being outside with immediate effect. and go to the shelter assigned to you. Follow the instructions by authorities and relief forces on site by all means. Gérald? - Yes? Nothing better to do? - No, nothing to do anymore. With this beautiful weather, we're only good for the Redoubt bunkers. Hey... Stop it! Will you get me some water, please? I can't. Why not? - Because. They're warm. Thanks. Mademoiselle. Yes? - Don't forget about the toy gifts for the customers. - Excuse me? It's important. No. I don't think anyone gives a shit in the given situation! Sir, we have a problem. He won't leave until he gets a bottle of water. Monsieur, please leave the store. We're closing. Monsieur... It's been a very exhausting day for all of us, But I don't have a bottle of water left. There's nothing left anymore. So this is what I suggest: You get up now, go to the exit, and in return... I'm going to give you a candy. Fuck. Take care of him. Alex, you can go home. More and more people are leaving their apartments and houses, seeking refuge in shelters. Due to the approaching catastrophe, the special staff of the Federal Department of Civil Protection has decided to reopen the closed down Redoubt bunkers from the Second World War. Due to their location and infrastructure, they offer the greatest possible security against the storm. Apart from the reactivated Redoubt bunkers, the 2,300 public protection facilities in the community centers are in use as well. Most people will find accommodation in the 360,000 private shelters... This is Corinne Weck's voicemail. I am currently not available, but you can leave a message. ...an emergency kit available that can be obtained from any delivery point. We are fine! We made the right decisions at the right time! We said "no" when we were to submit to the other countries. We said "yes" when it was about preserving our country as it is. And what happened? We are fine! Cheers everybody! - Cheers! Cheers! But I don't need to be a weather prophet in order to know exactly that all of this will soon be over for good. This is the darkest hour of the most beautiful country on earth. Fellow women, fellow men, fellow Swiss! Yes! That's right! But not the storm is the danger, no. I'm not afraid of my house being blown away, I'm not even scared of our entire village being blown away. That's force majeure, there's nothing you can do about it. No, fellow citizens. But when the storm comes, chaos will follow. And we all know very well that there are sufficient foreigners envying us... - True! ...the things we have in this country while they don't! As soon as our proud homeland is lying on the ground, they will come, from the south and from the east, they will flock to us from everywhere. But not in order to help, though. In order to take the last thing away from us that the storm spared. We know how they are, don't we? We know them. Given the chance, they'll take every little thing from us. Is that what you want? - No! For us to crawl down into the bunkers, waiting for it to be over, just as the smart guys from our government are telling us to do? And that when the storm is over, we'll come up again and have nothing left? Is that it? - No. So! Let us act! Absolutely, yes! We need to preserve what is and what always needs to remain. We want to be a united nation of brothers! I'm done! Gwerder! Gwerder! Gwerder... Gwerder! Gwerder! Albrecht, this daredevil, has already spoken to the Federal Council. There is no survival package. Go home. Have you ever been to Japan, Evelyn? Mr. Albrecht... It's been a couple of years. My first business trip. I didn't get out of the hotel for five days. Do you know why? Because of a typhoon. A huge typhoon caused a chaos. Blew rooftops away. Flushed cars out onto the streets. I sat there inside the hotel, and nobody would let me go outside. Initially, I got terribly upset. Then I got incredibly bored and... Then, on the third day... I started to make friends with myself. And I had the best two days of my life. Look, it stopped at the border. Are you as cold as I am? The ecstasy is fading. Hey, Pepino. Hello. - Hello. Birds. You know what? I want to screw you during the storm. Why? So we'll be together. Yes. 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242... Mrs. Meier? Are you there? Mrs. Meier? We're going to Germany. Mrs. Meier, can you hear me? Please open the door! Oh... I think we need to eat cold today. Monosodium glutamate, guar gum, acidifier: E 330... Doesn't really matter anymore, does it? PRAY, FREE SWISS. PRAY! Taxi service Stojanovic. Hello? Mr. Stojanovic, this is Casal. And now to the foreign countries: A mysterious cloud has been frightening our neighboring country Switzerland for two days now. Unexpectedly, it now stopped growing at the Swiss borders. Consequently, the danger of the weather phenomenon spreading to Germany seems to have been averted for now. According to reports not yet confirmed, several thousands of Swiss have already left their storm shelters for fear of the storm and are seeking refuge in the neighboring foreign countries. The European Union has summoned an emergency meeting in Brussels in order to consult about handling the Swiss refugees. Mom, only call in an emergency. I need to go. This is an emergency, Sandra. I cannot bear the air-raid shelter any longer. Mom, I'll come visit you tonight. You had a dream about him again, right? - What? - About the dead Nigerian. You know, the newspaper says that... I don't read the paper. - It says: born in Nigeria, died in Zurich. Mom, we have other problems now. The country is descending into chaos. The paper says it was heart failure. It wasn't your fault. It was an accident. - Mom, don't forget your pills. But not until after the meal. Sandra... Help me. Vishnu's shop is closed, too. He already ran away as well. I think the storm will come tonight. I want to fuck you when it starts... - Switzerland will be fucked! You're so full of shit. I'm serious. Finally something's happening. I think it's awesome. This whole Truman Show around here... I always knew that we don't deserve it. Everything okay? Yes, just a little headache because of the weather. Where are you going? - My brother is going to Germany with his family. Will stay with the boss of his company. - I'd like to have a boss like that. What about you? Are you going to the air raid shelter in your estate? Not as long as they need us out there. - We'll be at the store in two minutes. Freeze the situation right away but remember your own safety. René and Jolanda will cover the yard, Sandra will cover the back. And don't rise to provocation. Stop, police! Police! The other hand to the back! Sandra! Protect the back, go! Hello! Police! Is anybody there? You should have just bought water. Can't be that difficult. Geez. Hey. You know how important water is to me. - I had to work. Hey! I'm thirsty, damn it! Come on! Leave me alone. Silvan... Hey! You're such a coward. - Shut up. You're scared. Silvan. Stop! Freeze! Report! It's just Wisi. - Can't be. He doesn't walk like this. He's drunk. Maybe it's a good thing. If everything stays the way it is, I mean. Maybe the storm won't come at all and... - Shhh. Are you crazy? I think we're all to blame for this cloud. - Who, we? All of us, everyone in Switzerland. - Don't talk such nonsense. You heard what Gwerder said: "It's force majeure." And what's that supposed to mean? - Well, that none of us is to blame. You know, she wants to run away. - I didn't say that. Why? Is she scared that the storm will ruin her hairdo? Not much you can ruin there. - No. The real disaster is her head. Not that little cloud. - Right. It can't get any worse than that. I don't understand you. Why? - This belongs to a Kurd, a Tamil, a Balkan, an Indian, whatever. We could have gone to GLOBUS for such crap. Or to COOP before. - You told me to do it. You told me to. - It's so typical: You have no sense. That's why we're going downhill. Downhill? Downhill. Because we just don't talk about it. What is it we don't talk about? We don't speak. Don't talk. Just feel. But we talk every day. - About what, though? You know what? I don't want any of your crappy water. Ah fuck, baby. Don't you understand that I'm scared and would just like you to be there for me? Hey. Look at me, I'm sorry. - Go back then. Go and apologize. Shit. Fuck! Hey! Can you hear me? Hello? Operations center 1876, respond! Operations center 1876, respond. I am here. Calm down, Sandra. Calm down! Nobody can hear us down here. Calm down. Don't scream! Nobody will hear us down here. Nobody. Nobody, Sandra. It's me. That's impossible. I'm not dead. I've been hiding. With you. Down here we're safe. We have a lot to talk about. It's starting. Come with me. Are you okay? Let's go. My daughter. Do you recognize her? Hello, Sandra. Come here. This is for you. Sandra? Fuck, Sandy. What happened? Who's this? - It's me, Chris. Everything okay up there? We've arrested them. - Motherfuckers. Swiss, all of them. Motherfuckers anyway. Operations center 1219, found her. Operations center 1219, reply. ...the intolerable refugee policy. During the Second World War, from 1942 to the beginning of 1945, 110,000 Jews were rejected at our borders and sent to their death. It continues at our borders today. What does that have to do with the cloud threatening the country today? Today's cloud is a punishment and a plea. It causes this fear, this panic, because the people watching the cloud come closer see in it the epitome of the wrongdoing. We are a very ethical country. We're great people. But at the same time, this country has committed numerous crimes and still does. Corrupt rulers, tyrants bring their money to Switzerland. Bloody money from all over the world, especially from the Third World, while children starve to death back in their countries. They die because there aren't enough hospitals, and of despair. The money coming from this corruption ends up in Ali Baba's cave, located at the Bahnhofstrasse in Zurich. The Swiss know that very well. They don't do anything against it, and the spoliation of the Third World continues. It's the cloud of shame. The bad conscience is rising. Panic is starting to spread, because one day we will need to pay, and maybe this day is today. Do you think it's night or day outside? It's night even though it's day. I don't ever want to sleep again. Hello! Can you hear her? She's not very talkative today. The sand is white, the ocean is black, and it's reflecting the sky. There are miles and miles of traffic jams at all borders of the country. According to an estimate of the Federal Office for Migration, one million Swiss have left the country. Due to the stop-and-go traffic, more and more people are fleeing afoot as well. Learned anything? The network is gone. Scared? Where are we? Still on our way to Grandpa. I need to go to the bathroom. Anything wrong? No, everything's quiet. Listen, I'll go down real quick. To make sure everything is okay around the car. I'll be right back. Will you open up? And where do you want to go? Paris or... No idea, just away from here. I don't feel like sitting in this stupid village until the end of the world comes. But things have always turned out okay so far around here. We're not somewhere in Africa or wherever place down there. It's starting! They're coming! Out with you! What are you waiting for? Drive! We should get going, damn it. - Do you want her to pee her pants? Tell the asshole to give you the money or go back to one of his fucking apartments and light a candle. Are we clear? Sorry, but I need to see money now. Otherwise, you're getting out. There's a family in that car in the dark. They don't have any gas left. Move it now! Isn't that a Swiss license plate? He stole it, that dago. Keep following, Adi! Faster! Catch up with him! Stop there! We should have waited in the bunker. - I'm not discussing this with you now. And what now? - Get out! And the taxi? - It's just a car, Goran. A fucking car. Birds. CUSTOMS To all Swiss citizens! May I have your attention! The European Union decided that no further Swiss refugees will be admitted as of now. I repeat: All Swiss citizens are prohibited to enter the European Union until further notice. Please leave the border zone immediately! Go ahead! I can give you money, a lot of money. I'm sorry. - Here, take it. Nobody needs to see it. - No exceptions, I'm sure you understand! It would have worked five minutes ago, wouldn't it? - Please turn around. Open this gate now! - Enough now! This fucking border was not my idea. Please go back. Please! - Don't touch me! And the Yugoslavians are allowed in? They're allowed or what?
