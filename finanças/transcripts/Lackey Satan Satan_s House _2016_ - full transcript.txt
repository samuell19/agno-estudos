Everybody's trying to get out... Please save us. I keep going down the street. Everyone is screaming. I can see massive confusion. there's a lot of confusion. What? What's wrong? You okay? Have you ever thought about what life would be like if we had another child? Yeah. I mean it's crossed my mind but, you know the risk involved with us having another kid. - I can't lose you. - I know. I can't have any more children, I know. But I was thinking about adopting. Well it's something we've discussed in the past but I mean I'd be open to the possibility of it. I knew you'd be receptive and that's why I love you. Oh, so it's okay when you use electronics but give me a hard time about it. It's different, I'm your dad, I can do what I want. It's tough for a kid these days, I tell ya. Oh man, I can only imagine, the bills, stress, I honestly don't know how you do it. I'm going over to Ryan's house. Hey before you go, let me ask you something, how would you feel if we adopted a kid? I wouldn't mind at all. Anything to get all the attention away from me is a W. That's what I thought you'd say. Get out of here. What do you think about adopting? Oh I think it's a great idea. I got Max from a shelter and you know I love- -No, not a pet, a child. Well that's a big responsibility, but you know if you're in a position to change a child's life for the better, I don't see why not. Jesus, dad, it's 10 in the morning. What the fuck you knocking on my door for at 10 in the morning? Where's your house key? I drove Rebecca's car today. Oh, did you have to ask her for permission for that, too? I like how you decorated the place, empty beer bottles. I'm living the fucking dream, buddy. Oh we got to get you some shirts that fit. Says the guy in a Hugh Hefner robe. What's going on? Nothing much, I was just in the area I thought I'd drop by, see how you're doing. Well, I'm still breathing. Come on, pop. Come on pop, what? I haven't seen you in two months. I call you on the phone, you don't answer. I text, you respond maybe two weeks later, maybe not and when was the last time I saw my grandson? I've been busy with work. - You know that I have a- - Yeah, bullshit. You just don't come around anymore since you married that woman. Rebecca, her name's Rebecca. You would've known that had you come to our wedding. How's house hunting going? It's good. We've seen a few places we really like, narrowing our list so. Rebecca wants to adopt but I don't know. I just don't think we're ready for it. Eh, what's wrong with a pet? Then you'd have the perfect little family. Not a pet, dad, a kid, another human being. Mmm, mmhmm, how's my grandson doing? He's good. You should tweet him sometime, I know you're in to that social media stuff, too. Hey, hey, 33 followers and counting on the Twitter. You should come by the house sometime and have dinner with us, dad. Nah, I don't like Mexican food. She's Cuban, not Mexican. Is there a difference? On that note, I got to get to work. See you later, old man. Don't kill yourself. Put that away, you know the rules, no phones at the dinner table. Just updating my status, I'm almost done. Put it away now or I'll take it. One Updating your status? What happened to playing outside and hanging out at the park like normal kids? I just remember the days of kids talking to each other in person. Oh boy. Now you text, video chat, update statuses. I miss the good old days. These tacos are amazing, mom. Trying to change the subject, real nice. I'm going to my room, may I be excused? Why, so you can go update your status and twit? Tweet? Okay, you may be excused. It's your son. Hey, Esmeralda, everything okay? Yeah, I'm fine, just checking on you guys, how are you? Oh I'm good, just getting the day started. I think Rebecca's still asleep. I can wake her if you want. Oh no, no, no, no, that's fine. Let her sleep, let her sleep. I was just calling to see how it went yesterday with all that adoption talk. Yeah, it went well. I mean we still have to explore our options a bit more but, wait, when'd she tell you? Yesterday afternoon. I was at a loss for words, I tell you. Adopting is one thing, but a Haitian orphan. What? This is work calling. I have to talk to you later, bye. Good morning, handsome. Who was it? Your mother. What did she say? She just wanted to break the news about us adopting a Haitian orphan, you know the news you told me nothing about. I planned on bringing it to your attention today. Yeah? Well it would've been nice to have heard it from you and not your mother. You're my wife, Rebecca. I know. Well, I'm sorry for my lack of communication, okay, but to my credit, you were dozing in and out of sleep. How was I supposed to talk to you about it, huh? You were snoring. Sounds like an excuse. I have to get to work. When we discussed adoption in the past, you were fine. Just last night, you expressed interest. Yet today, your entire attitude has changed. I don't like surprises, you know that. No, no Will, I don't think that's the problem. Everything was okay until you found out that I wanted to discuss adopting a Haitian child. Don't try and guilt trip me. You did this because- - I just want to help change a child's life. I want us to help change a child's life. And I just feel like the whole race thing scares you. That's not true. I sure hope not. No comment. It's about love when adopting a child. Mom, thank you so much. How dare you call my husband and tell him about what we discussed, huh? You believe that, Mary Beth? No, I know you don't. But your son does. Oh, he's got the perfect little fucking family. He virtually forgot about me. I'm all alone. I miss you. I miss us. The forecast, plenty of sunshine for today. With seasonal temperatures, we should reach our normal high of about 82 degrees by this afternoon. Clear skies tonight with a low near 70. You got to let her go, old man. Sticky and humid with a high of 96. With the winds out of the east at 14 miles per hour, it's currently 75 degrees. Dad! Pop, wake up! What are you doing? I made lunch. I wanted to spend some quality time with you. So what did you do? It's about the adoption thing I told you about the other day. Another kid is a big responsibility. I understand but you got to look at it from her perspective. She's a woman who can't have any more kids, that's gotta be driving her crazy. It's like if you were shooting blanks. She lost that other kid. That's the kind of thing that stays with a woman all her life. So you should let her have it. Are you feeling okay? I know you're in there, I can still smell the stench of alcohol and cigarettes. She wants to adopt a kid from Haiti. Adopt a kid from Haiti? Who adopts a kid from Haiti except maybe Brad and Angelina? What? There's a ton of kids right here in South Florida who want to be adopted. Relax, we're only just discussing. No, no, no, I'm not gonna relax. That Latina wife of yours, she does whatever the fuck she wants to do and you just let her get away with it. She might hate me but you need to grow a pair. That's not true. Yeah? When was the last time she came over here with you and Taylor? The last time we crossed paths was at your mother's funeral. She doesn't give a shit about your old man. That's not true. Huh, then what's the problem? You want to know why she doesn't want to? She's not comfortable being around you 'cause you're always drunk and on fucking edge about everything, everything. You left some shells in this egg salad. Fuck you, I'm still hungry, I'm gonna eat. Hey baby, it's me. Sorry I yelled at you. I was just caught off guard, which is no excuse for me to blow up the way I did. Can we talk about it when I get home, is that okay? I love you, Becca, I hope you know that. I'm out of here. Hey, I didn't mean to blow up the way I just did. Eh, me neither, pop. You do what's right for your family always. Doesn't matter what I say or anybody else says. Make sure you keep working on that boat. We got a trip coming up, right? You remembered? Bet your ass I did, I wouldn't miss it for the world. Actually I don't know if I'd bet my ass on anything that risky. Touche, old man. I'm home. Got good news. This is it, we're here. I know, I'm nervous yet excited at the same time. We're bringing another child into our home. You ready for this? I am. Are you? I know we're ready. Yeah. Yeah. Mr. and Mrs. Baker, right this way please. Going to visit mom? Yeah, it's our 33 year anniversary today. Hey, can I ask you something? Sure, go for it. You ever think about moving on, finding another woman? Of course, I'm a man, ain't I? But you know, I made a vow to your mother and even though she's gone, I plan on keeping it. Looks like I'm getting you lotion and socks for Christmas. You're an asshole. Hey, we just left the adoption agency. What's happening with that? We're learning towards a girl named Geraldine. Rebecca really loves her. How old is she? She's 14. 14? You all are planning on adopting a teenage girl? Yeah. She's almost near puberty. You're gonna bring a teenage girl into a home with a soon to be teenage boy, that's gonna be some trouble. Don't forget to lock the door on your way out. How'd you guys hear about us, by the way? Google. Yeah, he Googles everything. I do. I ask perspective parents this question every time they walk into my office. There's so many children from this country that need a good home. So why a child from Haiti? Well, I remember I was watching the aftermath from the earthquake on TV and this little girl, she shows up on the screen and she must've been like six or eight, and she was crying and she was alone and nobody noticed because everybody was trying to pull bodies from a building nearby. That's when... that's when I knew. I did it for the income tax check. He's funny this guy, huh? Yeah. How many kids were brought here from Haiti? Far too many for us to handle, to be quite honest with you, hundreds, maybe 1,000 at this point. We're trying to get them all placed in good homes so that they can thrive in a better environment, especially after such a traumatic experience. Yeah, totally understand that. Well, thank you very much for everything, Tracy and we're looking forward to hear from you soon. Thank you. Thank you very much. Ma, it's happening. Say something. Mom, so excited, we can't wait to see you. Yay! Why are you guys smiling? Son, how would you feel about another woman in the house? What do you mean? Prepare yourself 'cause you're gonna have a sister very soon. Well, what's her name? Her name is Geraldine. She reads, she writes, and she speaks English. She seems like a perfect fit for doing my homework. Where do you get this stuff from? I already told you, the internet. I'm going shopping for clothes and decor for Geraldine's room. I was thinking of a pink and purple theme. Yeah, sounds fun. Fun enough for you to join? Let me think, I'll pass. Of course you will. Um, what are you gonna do with all your stuff in that room? Soon as I get a chance, I'm gonna put it in the storage. Honey, I'm home. Mr. Baker, I've got some great news for you. So? Yes, yes! Okay, you good? Good. Sorry Rebecca couldn't make it, she's at home making her specialty, lasagna. Yeah between me and you she's not the best cook in the world but she tries really hard at it. I try and get her to watch the Food Network but she's stuck watching Telemundo 24/7. You know, it's a Spanish channel. So whenever you eat something of hers and you have it in your mouth, when you go to swallow just maybe hold your breath. It's a little technique I use, so there's that. Okay, we're off. Are you hungry? You asked that like five minutes ago. You nervous? I just hope she likes her room, leave it, hope she likes the house, probably I should have gone with the yellow. Hey guys. Hi. Come on in. Welcome. Nice to meet you. Okay, let's eat. Yes, I hope you like lasagna. This is really good. Did you try something different? Well, I added a few new things just to make it special for Geraldine's arrival. Well it's working for me. Do you like it? Kill the guy in the back. You see him? Nice. Taught you well. Let me get this guy. Go for it. So what'd you think about Geraldine? She's cool. Doesn't talk too much. But we'll get along. She's not too weird. That's the attitude. So, what do you think? Anything you don't like, we can change it. I mean I can change it. You like? No, it's perfect. Great, yay. Hey. It's gonna take some time to get her to trust us. That's totally understandable, she's been through a lot. I know. Now it's our job to provide stability and happiness for her. I admit I'm beyond nervous about this. It'll be fine, trust me. Did Geraldine bring anything with her? No, not even a picture. But this is a fresh start for her, baby. Yeah. Rebecca! Here. Wonder what now. Pretty sure we're about to find out. Hi, Taylor posted a stupid status on my Facebook page. GiGi, A, you can call me mom, and B, how did Taylor get access to your Facebook page? He snuck into my room while I was taking a shower. You have a Facebook page? Yeah, we talked about this, you and mom. Yes, we did agree on it. Huh. What did Taylor say? Something about her peeing in the bed, nothing too serious. Ow! Hey, no hitting, remember? We use words. Exactly. Taylor, stay out of your sister's personal space. I won't tell you this again. Now apologize to her. Sorry for invading your privacy. Hug. Both. Good. Your dad has a meeting at work and I have a hair appointment. So I don't want any mishaps while we're gone, okay? How you doing with those carrots? Good. I used to have a knife back in Haiti to peel all the carrots but here we have a peeler, so it's a lot easier. Have you ever considered going back to Haiti? Yeah, it's a lot different now because of the earthquake but it's still home. Home is where the heart is, I get it. Well maybe that's a family trip we can take together in the future, you know? Really? Yeah. That would be awesome. How do you like our new home? I love it and I like that it's private. Can I just say that we are the coolest married couple in the world? I mean we adopted a kid and a dog. Boom. Hey I'm gonna go have a few spare keys made up, so I'll be back. You need anything while I'm out? No, I don't. Thank you, babe. Babe, just remember what we discussed. I know, Rebecca, you don't want my father to have a key. It's just that I don't like his drinking problem and I don't want any surprises. Okay. Will. Fine. But if grandpa doesn't have a spare, who's gonna let me in when I lose my keys? My kids got a point. We're usually at work when they get out of school and he always loses his keys. How 'bout you don't lose your key? There, problem solved. Okay, strike two. Dad? Shit. Oh goodie, it's you again. Yeah, nice to see you too. I came by to drop off your key. We went with the place in Riverland. Oh the three bedroom? Good for you. Thanks. Boat looks fantastic. So I assume we're a go for Saturday? She's ready. You and Taylor ought to spend the night on the boat here Friday, so we can just leave right from here Saturday. Taylor's not gonna be able to go, dad. What, why not? They're going to Disney World. It's GiGi's first time and our first family trip together. I'm gonna drive up there as soon as we get back. You know, I think we should switch to live bait for the next trip. Sure dad, whatever you want. You're the captain. Don't drink too much juice. Dinner's almost ready. Yay. Great. Wish somebody would've told me before. Keys are on the dresser in the bedroom. Thanks, I'm super late for my appointment. You sure you can't ride up with us tomorrow? It was supposed to be a family trip. Don't look at me like that, no puppy dog eyes. It's not gonna work. Please baby. Oh why are you so good at that? Sweetie, I have to go on the fishing trip with the old man. He's already bitter enough with Taylor not being able to go. I'll meet you guys there, we'll have a blast like we always do and we'll drive back down together as a family. Milk's in the fridge, cereal on the counter, ciao. Great, I gotta get through my shift with cereal. What did you say? Love you babe, have a great day. - What's up, baby? - Nothing. - You okay? - Yeah, yeah. Are you okay? Yeah. What's wrong? Sorry. Babe, your hand is cold. What did you say? I did this. This is all my fault. Go! Are you okay, baby? Yeah, sorry, just a bad dream. You sure? Fine. I'm gonna get some water. Okay. I'm starving. What'd you do to GiGi? She's been acting really moody. Nothing and don't blame me for the dryer either. What's wrong with the dryer? I don't know. All I know is that my clothes are still wet. Did you make breakfast? Never mind, I already know the answer to that. Where's that cereal? Here's your look at traffic. There's a stopped vehicle northbound on I-95 heading into East South Street. Two lanes will be closed tonight due to construction on the I4 entering Orlando. That's your drive at five. Never gonna catch anything with that lure. I think something took the bait and ran off with it. Oh I didn't tell you we got a dog. Yeah, what kind? Just a family dog. What breed? Pit bull. How far are you guys now? Okay, I'll keep the warm. Uh huh, okay bye. You know, what a great, what a great experience to be back at the stadium after so many years. If you just see the crowd, how energetic they are we got the children out there waving their baseball gloves and we've had such an exciting game up here in the bottom of the fourth inning and it is heating up because you know, at the end of this ball game, it's playoff time and only one of these teams is gonna go on. So I gotta tell you, to be in this booth and to see the energy of the field, it's just unbelievable. The forecast, plenty of sunshine through today, with seasonal temperatures... Hey babe. Did you guys get there yet? Good. Oh nothing, I was just watching TV before I dozed off. I'm just gonna take a shower and shave so I don't have to do it in the morning. Yeah. Damn raccoons. Please help me, Christian. Mary Beth? Mary Beth is that you? I'm in here, sweetie, this way. Christian? Christian! Tell me why would you do such a thing? Your hair looks amazing. Thanks, I'm glad you noticed. I spent nearly three hours under the dryers. It's nice but it's no way I would spend three hours on hair. You sound just like your dad. You missed grandpa today. Briefly, he was in the area, he just wanted to say hi. Hey. Grandpa, missed you, old guy. Hey kiddo, I missed you too. Listen, I was in the area. I thought I'd stop by and see how you all are doing. Where are your parents? Oh, dad is at work, mom's getting her hair done. What about that little girl? Geraldine? Yeah? She's in her room. You want to meet her? Calm down, it's just me. You scared me. Hey, I'm sorry if I startled you. My name's Christian. What's your name? Geraldine. Geraldine, do you know who I am? Um yeah, I've seen you on Will's photo albums. That's good. You're here all alone? Yeah. What's wrong? Dad, why didn't you call before stopping by? It's nice to see you too, son. Oh me, I'm doing fine. I didn't know I had to call in advance to see my family. I guess that's why I have a spare key. Hi dad. Get a chance to meet Geraldine? Yeah, we were actually just talking, very nice girl. Really? Yeah. Gigi, baby, you okay? Did my father say something to you? Did he upset you? It's okay. He touched me. Touched you, how? He put his hand in between my thighs. Dad. I'm gonna call Rebecca. No, no it's okay, no need to get mom involved. Look, I'll tell her. But for now, just keep it between us, okay? I don't ever want to be around him. You won't, I promise. I won't ever allow it to happen. Dad, I need to speak with you in the kitchen now. Can't it wait? This is getting good here. No, it can't. Get your panties out of a bunch, I'm coming. Kiddo, I'll be right back, okay? What, you got something to say to me or is this gonna be a staring contest? I'm only gonna ask you this once, and I suggest you're honest with me the first time. What happened with you and Geraldine? Nothing, introductions, that's all. Bullshit. That's how you talk to me? She said you... I what, son? Spit it out. Violated her. Are you kidding me? You believe her? Maybe. You know, I put up with your Latina wife and now this little girl is here and the first day I meet her she says I touched her. I can see in your eyes, you believe her, don't you? I don't know who to believe right now, dad. After all I've done for you, this is how you repay me? You know, I lost your mother and now I'm losing you. Dad? Dad, is that you? Pop? Will, remember what I told you? You do what's right for your family always. Now this is our little secret, son. You can't ever tell mommy, okay? Okay. You'll have to teach me your language. Are you going to tell Rebecca what happened? I spoke with my father and he confessed, he said he had been drinking. It won't happen again, I'll make sure of that. She needs to know. Look... GiGi, I know you're hurt but sometimes bad things happen to good people. Let's just get past it. Can it be our little secret? Secret, son. Look, I love you and that will never change, okay? Goodnight. Goodnight. You're an animal. Our little secret, son. I know what you did to Will. He told me on my death bed. Dad, is that you? Our little secret, son. He looked up to you. You deserve this. You can come be with me now. Just do it. Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! You can come be with me now. Pop? Will, remember what I told you, you do what's right for your family always. Now this is our little secret, son. You can't ever tell mommy. - Okay? - Start the fucking car, fuck, fuck! - Okay. - What's wrong, dad? - He's coming for me. - Dad I'm right here! - What's wrong? - Move back! - I can't, I can't fucking move. - Talk to me, I'm right here! I can't fucking move. I didn't mean to touch her. Just let me go. What did you do? - What the fuck did you do? - Start the fucking car! Brady Bunch, grandpa's here. You know, I suggest you keep your mouth shut, little girl unless you want to be on the first thing smoking back to Haiti. You don't want that, huh? You like living in America? Sure beats living in a tent eating mud pies. It's gonna be our little secret, huh, GiGi? Now this is our little secret, son. Can it be our little secret? You fucking touched her? I was weak. I was weak. Hurry, my love. Ah, Ahh! What the fuck! Do it.
