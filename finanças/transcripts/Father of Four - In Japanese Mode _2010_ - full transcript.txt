FATHER OF FOUR - IN JAPANESE MODE - Good morning. - Good morning. Hello? Hello? Where is everybody? - How very strange. Hello? - Hurry, Uncle Anders. We're waiting. My goodness! Have you moved in with the neighbors? - You went to the wrong house. - It's unlawful. - Good morning, everyone. - Quiet! Don't give it away. - It's a surprise. - Doesn't he know it's his birthday? BODIL AND PER'S ROOM Come. - Hold this for a minute. - Hold this. I'll count to three, open the door, and we all yell 'Happy birthday, Per'. 1, 2, 3. Happy birthday, Per! Per? - He's not here. - Where is he? - It's unlawful. - Don't be afraid. It's only me. - Goodness! - We wanted to surprise you, Per. - Wasn't it funny, Dad? - Yes, extremely. You got the whole cake to yourself. Don't I get some presents? That's for you, Bodil. That's all from Stardust. Are you Denmark's next pop idol? - Ole, this is your big chance. - We're not cool enough. You're really good. - A PSP! Thanks, Uncle Anders. - You're welcome, Little Per. My name isn't Little Per anymore. I'm 9 years old. - Do we call you Medium Per? - The cake is ready, Uncle Anders. I'll do that. We don't want any more accidents. What you doing in my house? We Tanaka from Japan. This our new house. - Do you understand him? - My home. - He thinks he is going to live here. - No, you've misunderstood. We move in, you move out, Cake Face. - Wait a minute. We live here. - They must be our new neighbors. This is where you live. They must have given you the wrong address. - Tokyo made a mistake. - You apologize. - We don't have to apologize. - I know what the nice man means. - We should accept his apology. - Thank you. - In Japan, old man very wise. - Thank you. The same to you. - Mie, did you remember the camera? - Where are we going? - To the zoo. Just like last year. - Those Japanese are slaving away. - Here. - Thanks, little boy. - Hurry. We want to see the lions. - Shouldn't we help? - It's your birthday. - They would have asked for help. - You say we should help others. - Yes, but ... Right. - Careful. Don't drop it. - Why have you come to Denmark? I work at the Technical University of Denmark. - I'm a professor. - Of what? Independent artificial memory robotic system. - What? - Artificial intelligence. Things that can think for themselves? Do we have that in Denmark? - Denmark. Good land. - Gotland? No. Denmark. - It's beautiful. - It's over 200 years old. - You're very good at Danish. - I'm a translator. I speak several languages. How do you say fruit pudding with cream? - Who's that? - Our son Shin. - Does he speak Danish? - He's learning. - Is he going to sit there all day? - He misses his friends in Japan. Hi, my name is Per. I'm your new neighbor. Is your name Shin? Welcome to Denmark. Today's my ninth birthday. How old are you? Are you this old? We're the same age. I got a PSP with WiLife. Want to try it? Look out for the lion. Use the pole. Jump! We did it! You're good at it. Shin, will you show me your stuff? Look. - Why are you all dressed alike? - It's our school uniform. Those are my best friends. - Do you know manga warriors? - The ones from Dragon Ball? I have manga outfits, too. Want to play manga warriors? - Whoa. How did you do that? - It's judo from Japan. I can jump, too. Want to see? - Ready? - Yes. You're good at that. Turn it on. - Nothing. - How long are you staying? If Denmark likes us, we like Denmark. If we haven't settled in in a month, we're going home. - And you still learned Danish? - We want to stay if Shin settles in. So you're giving it a trial run. If Shin doesn't like school, we leave. I can see that you're thinking of Shin. - The water's on. All is well. - Thanks to your pipe wrench. Just say the word. Father is at your disposal 24/7. - Really? Any time? - Yes ... of course. - What are neighbors for? - Thank you. My husband can't make water, but he is a clever inventor. It's a vacuum cleaner. Voice controlled. Clever, isn't it? - Sorry, Father-san. - Just call me Father. 'San' means honored. Father-san. Honored Father. If everyone's as nice as Father-san and Uncle Anders-san, we'll be fine. - Per, don'tjump on the bed. - Shin taught me. - You have fun together. - Is Japan different from Denmark? Honor is more important to the Japanese than it is to us. So if you've made a decision, you can't change your mind. Did you enjoy your birthday even if we didn't go to the zoo? Yes, very much. I think Shin and I will be good friends. - Let's see if they stay here. - Won't they? If Shin doesn't settle in, they'll leave in a month. I'll help Shin settle in. - We have Math and Danish. - Okay. - Hi, handsome. - Good morning. - Hi, Per. - Hi, Mie. Hi, Shin. You don't have to wear your school uniform. - My father said so. - Yes. - I'll take you the principal. - That's very kind, Per. It's this way. Thank you. - Welcome to Lundtofte School. - Many thanks. We hope it's a good school for Shin, Principal-sensei. - Call me Poul. - Poul-sensei. - Just Poul. - Just Poul-sensei. My daughter goes to this school. She goes here, too. I'm sure Shin will settle in quickly. Don't you think so, Shin? - Yes, Mr. Principal. - No need to call me Mr. Principal. Just Poul. - Yes, Just Poul. - I'll help Shin settle in. Good, Per. Then he's in good hands. Hi. What's up? - Stop it, Mark. - Want a puff, Celine? Your dad won't let you. Remember. No problems or trouble. Of course not, Mr. Tanaka. I was talking to Shin. Yes, Father. No problems. I promise. - Good boy. - Come on, Shin. Stay away from those guys. Especially Mark. He teases everybody. Can I buy a smoke? - Do you two want a smoke? - No thanks, Mark. - What about you, Slant-Eye? - His name is Shin. Leave him alone. Cool. Look at this slant-eyed face. - Don't let him get to you. - Did I see a cigarette here? - Hi, Dad. - Do you see any smokes? Do you? You know it's not allowed. If you smoke here, you'll be suspended. - I'm warning you. - Right, Poul. And remember. I don't want any problems or trouble. Relax. - Why didn't you say anything? - They'll beat me up. We have a new classmate. He's from Japan and his name is Shin. S-H-I-N. Welcome, Shin. I am your class teacher. My name is Miss Suhr. S-U-H-R. - Yes, Amanda? - What does Shin mean in Danish? - Can you tell us, Shin? - Shin is short for Shinichi. - It means 'the first one'. - Good answer. Thank you. Say ''My name is Shin and I'm from Japan'' in Japanese. - Miss, where is Japan? - Shin, will you show us on the map? - Japan is here. - And here is Denmark. Japan is on the other side of the earth. Thank you, Shin. Don't laugh. That's how you show respect for your teacher in Japan. - How did you learn Danish? - My mother taught me. - What do you know about Danes? - They love flags and eat cheese. - Who are they? - The Norse gods from our play. This year our class is performing the school play. - Can I be in it? - Sure. No! Don't! Put me down! That was mean! You can't just ... You're nasty. - Mie, what happened? - There's Slant-Eye. - Let's give him a wet welcome. - Mark, we have to practice. - Where are they? - We agreed to practice. - It's typical of Mark. - We have a gig tonight. We don't want to mess up on our first gig. It's wet pants for you, Slant-Eye. - Good job, Shin. - I've got him. - Come here, you gook. - Let him go, Mark. I'll get you. - You're dead meat. - Look out, Shin. Can't you beat a third grader, Mark? - We'll drown you. - Mark! Look! - Right back at you. - Stop it right now! - I won't put up with your pranks. - It was just for fun. You three have detention. Any more trouble, and you'll be suspended. Got that? Per, Shin and Mia. If anyone causes trouble, talk to the teacher on playground duty. - Don't start a fight. - I know. I'm sorry. Now shake hands and make up. - How about you, Shin? - Do as the principal says. Shake hands with them. You can't leave without permission! Let him go. It's his first day. Mark, I hope it's the last time I see you in my office. - Why did Shin get so mad? - The Japanese are very proud. They won't do something if they think it's unfair. - We just shook hands. - They get upset if their pride is hurt. - I don't get it. - I have a student meeting now. - Bye. - Bye. - Hi. Want to ride home together? - Okay. - Hi. - It isn't over. - We made up. - No, we didn't. Just you wait. Don't be scared. If they do anything, we'll tell on them. We won't tell anyone. Especially not my father. The tree is crooked. Isn't it, Mr. Tanaka? The tree is crooked. Isn't it, Mr. Tanaka? - Very crooked. - How about now? - Is it straight now? - Here come the boys. - Hi, you two. - Hi. - How was school? - Fine, Mother. - What did you learn today? - About Thor and the Norse gods. - We're putting on a play. - So no problems? - No, no problems. - What are you doing? I'm planting an Asian tree in my spare time. Isn't it marvelous? We neighbors help each other. I don't like to lie. - Why can't we tell them? - Don't you see? - Explain it to me. - We'll go home if school goes badly. - Why? - It will bring shame on my parents. But Mark is out to get us. You heard him say so. - I'm telling my father. - No, don't. - Okay. I won't. - Promise? - Yes, but it won't be easy. - Thanks, Per. - What are you doing? - Saying good night to my friends. He says I'm lucky to live in Denmark. Thank you very much. Thanks. We have good news after the break. - They love us. - You're awesome. Mie, take that. - Would you please smoke outside? - No. Rock stars suit themselves. Do you have a crush on Mie? - Have you seen Peter? - He is probably at work. When will he realize that I'm his top priority? - Hi, sweetie. Sorry. - That's okay. - Did I miss it? - They're playing another set. Hello again. Our band is still called No Limits, and we have good news. - We're going to be on 'Stardust'. - They signed up after all. Awesome! Drum solo! Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Tanaka. - Good morning, Uncle Anders-san. - Come in. We have a surprise. Pardon me for asking, but what are you doing? Tai Chi. Chinese morning exercises. It's called 'Carry Tiger back to Mountain'. You learn? I'll teach you. Shin, move. Stand here. Forward and push. And pull him back. And then push. Here, Uncle Anders-san. It's a gift from us. You shouldn't have. What a surprise. It's because you helped us with the garden and welcomed us. A kimono. I've always wanted one. How did you know? Now you're a true Japanese wise man. - Hi. - Good morning, asshole. - Did you call him an asshole? - It's just for fun. - For fun. - Out of camaraderie. Hi, Shin. - Have a nice day at school. - Thank you, Mrs. Tanaka. We have to hurry, or we'll be late. - Good morning, Father. - Morning. Stupid gate. It does this every morning. Open up! Being a father of four isn't easy. - Father-san gets a gift, too. - Any ideas? You are old and wise. Yes. Let me see ... Hey! Stop spraying water on her. What's up, Celine? Look at those two. What jerks. They deserve a beating. We'll take them out. ''Be cool. Don't be a fool. Quit smoking.'' - Awesome, Mie. - I hope they work. Those guys smoke. Mark sells cigarettes to fifth graders. He could be suspended for that. - Will you take a picture of us? - Sure. Smile. We're putting on a Viking play. We'll all be dressed as gods and giants. Here are some giants. This is Thor with his hammer. He drives his chariot and makes thunder. - I want to play him. - Good idea. You would be good. Nikolaj, you're Thor. Per and Shin are the guard giants. Amanda is the mother giant. Clara, you're Freyja. - Being giants will be fun. - Are giants good or evil? - Mostly evil. - I don't want to be evil. - Move, stupid giants. - I'd rather be Thor. - Thor isn't Japanese. - Victor! Don't tease people because of their appearance. Apologize. I'm sorry, Shin. - Uncle Anders, could you help me? - Slowly ... What are you doing? I'm taking the tiger back to the mountain. Why can't I open this stupid gate? Hello? Per? Why is the light on during the day? I told you to turn it off. Can't I even turn on the TV? It sounds like science fiction, but artificial intelligence is ... What is going on here? Uncle Anders, has there been a problem with the electricity today? Now what? Mr. Tanaka. - What are you doing here? - Father-san already home. - You like gift? - Gift? A self-thinking house. Voice controlled. - So the gate ...? - Yes. As a thank you gift. I show you. Light on. Light off. - Voice controlled. - It's absolutely brilliant. Aren't you thrilled about home rule? Yes. Thank you, Mr. Tanaka, but I'm not sure I need it. There's more. Tonight we have friendship dinner at my house. I'm afraid I can't. I have accounting to do. Father, when will you learn? Family first, work second. You very wise, Uncle Anders-san. Family is Father's most important job. And we will play 'Sing Star'. Yes. The loser does the dishes. - What are you waiting for? - We're coming, Uncle Anders. Wait. Watch this. Lights off. Lights on. Lights off. - We've already seen it. - Isn't it fantastic? Look at Mr. Tanaka. Kids, promise me you'll behave. Tonight we're visiting another culture. Good evening. Asshole. Welcome, asshole. You're very quick learners. - Thank you for inviting us. - Thank you. They're beautiful. Come in. In Japan, no shoes inside. Leave them on mat. Take them off. It's a Japanese tradition. - Now we're in Japan. - We sure are. - What a beautiful flower decoration. - I made it myself. It's ikebana. How do you say 'very beautiful'? Very good. - They're awesome. - I wish I was a manga warrior. - They have a samurai sword. - Ole, don't touch. Sorry. That's okay. The bonsai tree is only 150 years old. - I was going to prune it anyway. - I'm very sorry. What are those things on the wall? Shin's diplomas. He's a good student and good at Japanese martial arts. - You must be proud of him. - Very. Come. Let's eat. - Please sit down. - Thank you. These are Danish dishes served in Japanese style. Chicken soup. Pork sausage with pickled beets. Potatoes and gravy and beef patties and onions. Fruit pudding with cream. Meatballs with very sour cucumbers. Pork roast with cherry sauce. Rice pudding with red cabbage. Help yourselves. - Pork roast and cherry sauce? - Yes, and rice pudding and cabbage. - There. It looks delicious. - Eat the Japanese way. Chopsticks. How fun. Shin. - What to have first? - We drink tea in the morning. You forget we're in Japan. It's morning there. - This is Japanese rice wine. Sake. - Thank you. And then we'll hit the sack. Sake and sack. It's funny ... Is that Danish humor? Making fun of Japanese rice wine? It's because they sound the same. Sake and sack. - Father, what are you on about? - This is delicious. Japanese pork sausage. - Per, you're slurping. - It means that you like it. Everyone knows that, Father. This looks good. I'll try it. - You don't like the food. - I'm sorry. I dropped it. It was a joke. Japanese humor. I have cutlery. Certainly not! When in Rome, do as the Romans. - Isn't that so, Mr. Tanaka? - Uncle Anders-san. What's so funny? It sounded like he said, ''Uncle Understand.'' - Our new neighbors are nice. - And Shin is a good friend. - How is he doing in school? - Fine. We're doing a Viking play. - Shin and I are playing giants. - I'm looking forward to that. - Will you be dressed as giants? - Yes, but it's not what you think. We are the wild giants We are the wild giants and we love to eat and fight we are very defiant and everyone loves our might we fart and pick our noses and we can burp by the score we scream and yell and hit some blows and we tease Odin and Thor - Per and Shin, what are you wearing? - These are our 'cosplays'. - That means manga costumes. - But you are the guard giants. - Don't you like them? - I can jump, too. - No. That won't do. - Why not? I won't discuss it. Go change into your real costumes. I thought it was a good idea, but Miss Suhr has too much on her mind. Unbelievable. Mark is selling cigarettes again. - Why don't the teachers stop him? - He's too clever. - Look at those two. - What the hell are you wearing? - It's none of your business. - You look like sissies. Careful. - Don't. - He pushed me. - We'll be sent to the principal. - Hello? Hi, Bjorn. I'm glad you called. I'm running out of smokes. - He's going to get more cigarettes. - Let's follow him. - We have class. - But we can bust him. - Do you see him? - I think he got away. - Listen to him beat those skins. - Turn it down! What a loser. How many do you want? - Three cartons. - Three? - Are all the school kids smoking? - Yeah, I'm making big money. - Our band is going to be on TV. - No way. - We'll be on TV2. - Then you'd better stay away. - Why? - You'll be hounded by the paparazzi. Here. They're hot, so don't tell anyone where you got them. - Who the hell is that? - Come on, Shin. - What are you doing here? - Don't let them get away. - Let's split up. - Okay. - Why were you taking pictures? - To get Mark suspended. Delete them. Let's get the other kid. Mark, watch this one. You go with me. - We'll find that little squirt. - Damn brats. Want some more? - I can't get out. - It's tight. How do you say 'best friend' in Japanese? Shinyuu. Remember not to tell my father or anyone else. - Okay. Deal. - Good. It's too bad we didn't get any proof. - Here they are. - Good. - Hi. - Where have you been? - Outside playing. - Do you know what time it is? - We lost track of time. - And skipped class. - Look at me. Is that true? - Shin. Did you skip class today? - Speak up. Did you skip class? - It's my fault. I asked him to. I'm shocked. - Shin never skipped class before. - Neither did Per. Shin no play with Per anymore. Per is bad influence. - We should help each other. - I don't need your help, Father. Come, Shin. - Per, what happened today? - Shin isn't settling in at school. I see. But you still shouldn't skip classes. It won't do. - Now it's my fault if they go home. - No, Per. It's not your fault. Shin is my best friend. Now his father won't let us play together. - Mr. Tanaka has a short temper. - Will it help if Shin likes school? Yes, I'm sure of it. And there's plenty of time. - Only two weeks. - Then we'll have to help each other. Hi, Shin. It's weird not riding to school together. My dad is still mad. I am the thunder god Thor the strongest in the world - I can get mad ... - I'm feared by every giant. Mjollnir is my hammer here it is when I swing Mjollnir everyone should flee from me Nikolaj, you have to learn it by heart. I can't remember all the words. I'd rather be a giant without lines. Now go and learn it by heart. Off you go. We'll rehearse the giants' scene. Gods off the stage, please. Hurry up. We are the wild giants I am the thunder god Thor the strongest in the world I can get mad and I'm feared by every giant Mjollnir is my hammer you can see it right before you when I swing Mjollnir everyone should flee from me When I'm driving my chariot thunder and lightning are all around my goats are going full speed I will always be in the lead - Shin, that's Thor's song. - I know it by heart. - I'll be Thor since Nikolaj won't. - Thor isn't Japanese. Exactly. Or ... No ... I mean ... We can't change things now. Nikolaj wants to be a giant, and Shin wants to be Thor. Can't they switch? Stop it! I'm in charge. Do as I say. Shin, you're a giant. Say your line. There you are. Aren't you coming in? - I don't want to be in it. - But we're the guards. - Who will be the other one? - I don't want to. Okay. I'm going to talk to Shin. - Hi, Shin. Is something wrong? - No. - Come on. What is it? - I miss my friends in Japan. I'll never settle in in Denmark. Look at those kids playing soccer. Hassan is from Turkey. - He felt like an outsider, too. - Japan is farther away. Hassan realized that his friends wished him well in his new country. - Do you want to be in it after all? - Is it okay? Sure. You're the guard giant. Here. - Sorry, shinyuu. - Shinyuu. - I have to go, or I'll be late. - I have something to show you. I made it myself. Look. Wow. It's pretty. - Mrs. Tanaka taught me. - Did you really make it yourself? It's called ikebana. Japanese women are really into it. And it tells Japanese men what mood their women are in. - So you're feeling great. - Not quite. It's drooping a bit. I don't see it. You're good at it, but I really have to go. See you. Open. - Konnichiwa. - Konnichiwa, Uncle Anders-san. My, you're busy. Hi, everyone. We're going to get ice cream. - Would you like some? - An ice-cream cone with the works. How about you? - Are you still not on speaking terms? - I'm on speaking terms. - Fights with neighbors are awful. - He's as stubborn as a sumo wrestler. Talk some sense into Mr. Tanaka. Get on with it, Father. Mr. Tanaka, this is ridiculous. Can't we be good friends? - Don't spray water on me. Apologize! - First you apologize for Per. Never. Grouch. - Oops! Was it turned on? - I'll get you. I won't apologize. You apologize first. - Father, what's going on? - Mr. Tanaka has lost his mind. You're nuts. Insane! Thank you. That was very good. We have few adjustments to make. I'll be right back. - What's up, Mark? - What do you mean? - You're acting normal. - We're going to rock on TV! - I like your style. - It suits you. Keep it up. - That's up to me. - We're ready. From the top. - Give it your all. - Lights, camera. Let it rip. - Do we have any more seaweed? - I think we have enough futomakis. We have everything. Nigiri, uramaki and hosomaki. - Stir the miso soup, Per. - Right, Uncle Anders-san. - Where is Father? - Working. - How did it go, Ole? - Super. It will be a hit. - How did Mark behave? - Normally. No problem. What? He usually teases people. - Hi, Father. - Time for dinner. - What's this I smell? - Sushi. According to Mrs. Tanaka's recipes. I bet you didn't expect that. The ones with shrimp are good. Pass the onions, please. - Would you like a beef patty? - You make good Danish food. - Does that mean we can stay? - We'll decide in a week. I would like to stay. - Can I buy a smoke? - Five kroner. - Can I buy a smoke? - Five kroner. Christ, your dad is praising those stupid posters again. Take a look. They're very good. - Leave your bag here. - Okay. Come with me. Hurry up. - Mark, isn't that a bit mean? - It's a joke. Call your father over. - Do it yourself. - Don't you dare? Dad? Come here a minute. Don't! - Per! - It's not mine. You know it's not allowed. I'm disappointed in you. Shin! This will cost you. - Did you have a lovely day at work? - Yes, Uncle Anders. - Yes, thanks, Uncle Anders-san. - It's nice to see you getting along. Open gate. But ... - What are you doing? - It's the sink. What should we do? - Father didn't do it right. - Get Father and his tools. You mean his pipe wrench? Never! I'll fix it myself. Coffee. I would like some coffee. - Did someone say coffee? - Yes, to turn the machine on. - But it's not on. - Nothing here works properly. Lights. Living room lights on. Lights on! Off. Lights off. Turn off! I'm going to disconnect it. - But how? There aren't any switches. - I wouldn't mess with it. But it's supposed to work. Wouldn't it be a good idea to ask Mr. Tanaka? Now it's off. - I should say so. - There we go. - Did you do that? - No. Range hood off! Off! Off! Turn off range hood! Turn off! It can't hear you. Stupid Danish water system! - What's going on? - Kamikaze, bonsai, Kawasaki. Suzuki, Toyota, Tokyo. That's enough. Off! Father, now you must ask Mr. Tanaka to help. Why? It stopped when I said off. - Aren't you the wise man? - At last you need my advice. Get Mr. Tanaka. - I need your help. - Same here. Help me first. Help me first. I asked first. I should never have come. Stop it. You're behaving like children. - Am not. He started it. - Baby. It's unlawful! Now shake hands and make up. - Uncle Anders-san is right. - Yes, for once. - I'm sorry. - It's from the school. Hello? Speaking. What? We'll be right there. It's about Per and Shin. - The principal wants to see us. - Now? Very serious. No, it will be fine. This is very serious. - The boys aren't selling cigarettes. - How did they end up in their bags? When I catch someone red-handed, there's only one solution. - What's that? - Suspension. Mark did it. We didn't dare say so. He sells cigarettes to all the kids. - Then it's just a misunderstanding. - It's unlawful! School very bad for Shin. Great shame on family. - But they didn't do anything. - Enough. Only problems and trouble. We're going back to Japan. - I don't understand. - I don't understand either. Honor is very important to Mr. Tanaka. - I'm sorry Shin is leaving. - So am I. Cheer up. We're going to the zoo tomorrow. It will be the last time I see Shin. - I will miss you, shinyuu. - Likewise, shinyuu. - Can't we do anything about it? - It's too late. He's made up his mind. He might change his mind, if he sees how happy you are here. Alright. We're ready to go inside. I'm glad you came. Listen up. We all stick together ... Move. Too bad you couldn't stay, Shin. - What did my dad want? - He had no proof that I sell smokes. I was let off with a caution. - Don't tease the animals. Alright? - Okay. Come along. Let's play elephants. - Look how happy Shin is. - Yes, he hasn't been for a long time. - Can't you stay then? - No change mind. Leave tomorrow. - Father, can we have an ice cream? - Have you seen the line? - I'd like one. - We'll keep you company, won't we? - Go ahead. We'll find you. - Let's go see the flamingos. Keep walking. Do come with us. Did you notice the spider monkey? Not really. The Latin for lion is Panthera leo. Did you know they don't like water? - Is that why there's water around it? - Yes. Look who's over there. Let's feed the lion. - Hold these. - Do you see it? It's over there. - What are you doing? - Don't you want to see the lion? - Take a picture. - Mie! - Put me down! - Leave Mie alone. - Put her down, you idiot. - Mark! - Help! - We have to help her. Get a ladder. Do something! Out of the way! - It's coming. - We'll confuse it. Ready? 1, 2, 3. Now. Where is Mark? - Hey, where are you going? - I need to borrow it. - What's up? - It's a matter of life and death. Come on, Mie. Hurry! - Do something. - What's going on? - Careful, Per. - My pole. Now what? I'll save you. Come on! Thanks for your help, Per and Shin. And Mie, I'm sorry. I was an idiot. Let's give them a hand. I am Thor. The strongest god of them all. - Alright, Shin! - Quiet. Today we have a visitor from a country far, far away. I am a samurai from Japan, the land of the rising sun. Are you the thunder god Thor from the cold north? I would have thor't so. Greetings, samurai. Now you are in Denmark. Settling in can be hard, but you'll like it here - - as long as you love flags and eat cheese. - How very true. - You're very wise, Uncle Anders-san. - I'm glad you're staying here. - Per is a good influence on Shin. No more silly teasing no more quarrels or war it's best not to be at odds with those giants or those gods now there is no more hostility Never will we be mean to people who are different we would rather help the people we meet on our way we all get along so well even with those who aren't swell there is always room for you and me Here. I thought we could take a trip to Japan. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SHIN ... 2, 3. Now. Happy birthday, Shin. - Now you're a year older than me. - That's why you're called Little Per. Happy birthday to you ... - Hi! We're in Tokyo. - Hi. This place is awesome. We're staying. Right, Peter? - Right. - It was a joke, Father. Ole, your band is a huge hit here. Look.
