IN MEMORY OF MOM AND DAD Come on, boys! Time to get ready. Bikash! - Moba, get ready. - Yes? In a minute. Give it back. You ripped it off. Give it. - Take a shower. You're stinking. - I'm ready. You're not ready. Come on, Rohan, get ready. It's time to go. Dude, let me pump. Like you'll become Rocky in a day. Looking sexy, bro. Come on. Sir. Yes. Yes, I… You'll receive the photos and videos. If possible, have a look at it. Yes. The team is solid. Yes, sir. Goodbye. Sir, we're almost ready. We can leave in 30 minutes. What's the rush? Let's play one game. Let it be. I can't see you losing again. Fucker, I think I trained you in the wrong game. Brother Rajeev… don't you think we should wear, like, some matching jerseys, - or like black t-shirts today? - No. - I was thinking that… - Don't think. Just go and change! - Couldn't find anyone better? - I'll handle him. Don't worry. Let's leave after breaking our fast. Okay. I told you, boys. Let's go to the embassy in the morning itself. Absolutely irresponsible, both of you. Mom, how could we possibly know this would happen? Thanks to you, we're not in Malaysia. The elders will celebrate Eid there, and we're stuck here. Do you know how upset your grandfather is? Not his fault the embassy ran out of ink. Yes, right. It's my fault if my boys cannot wake up in the morning. If only we had reached earlier in the day, our visas would've been stamped. But you reached the embassy five minutes before the visa office closes. Did you try to knock some sense into your Chhotu? How important it is for him to go and do his Master's? - Please hear him out once, Mom. - Stanford. People struggle to get a seat and here they are inviting him. Right, Mom, but what I... The least you can do is make him understand. How many times do I have to tell you - the same goddamn thing? - Stop talking to her like that. No, this is not fair. I've said it a million times. I don't want to go to Stanford. I want to stay in Bangladesh, I want to work here. But no, we only have to do what mom wants. And mom wants to send me away, right? Why do you keep pushing me away? Faraaz! I'll talk to him. But, Nazneen, we haven't received any quotations from them. Yes, you can send them in. Yeah. And let Dr. Mujahid also know, please. And the file on my table by tomorrow nine. Yes. Now that I'm not going to Malaysia we might as well… Yes, exactly. - So you, Dr. Mujahid, all... - Mom. Nazneen, let me call you back. Yeah. Mama, I'm sorry. You don't want to go to Stanford. That's fine. If you aren't happy, how can I be? And will you please stop assuming things, Chhotu? Why will I want to push you away? I'm just concerned about your future, and I just want the best for you. I know. But… don't stress so much about my future. Where are you going? Holey Artisan. I told you. Chhotu. Mom. Whatever I do, I'll make you proud, okay? Don't finish all the chicken. - I am... - Dude, your plate's still full. I'll pack the dates. Don't others have to eat? Finish your food first. Dude, I'm a heavy eater. - Heavy eater my… - Pass the chicken. Chicken… It'll get over like this. But you have plenty on your plate. It's always the case with him. Always. Your plate is already full. Eat a little less, man. I have it. Can you pass me the onions? You know what… go and unpack. - What happened, Brother Rajeev? - Let's drop it for now. We'll pick this up later. Go. - Go and unpack. - Bro, we've been training for so... Shut up And why did you stop eating? Carry on, and have a feast. Eat. Eat. Enjoy the feast. These fritters… bananas. How about I order some biryani if you're still hungry? It'll be a lavish treat. Look, if you want to act like kids… then go back home. I don't need you. - I'll manage on my own. - Don't say that. - Sorry, Brother. - Why are you saying sorry? Why are you saying sorry? Prove me wrong! Prove it! Make me believe that I haven't dug my own grave, by picking you all. Prove it! Show me that your generation isn't useless. That they have the passion… which the whole world will notice and say, "They are our heroes. We want to be like them. We want to achieve what they did." Stop fighting like you're in kindergarten. My fritters, my bananas, my clothes, my this, my that. What the fuck is this attitude, assholes? I mean your bond and your unity is so weak. Why even blame the world? And then you say you want to fight for everyone, bloody losers! - I don't think you guys can do it. - Bro… - Bro… - Brother Rajeev! - Brother Rajeev! - Brother… - We'll do it. - We want to do it. We'll do it. Goodbye. Run! Shut the door! Get up, go inside. I won't shoot, get in. Run. All of them… everyone is dead. Keep quiet. Stay down. Stay low. Move. Move. Calm down, stay quiet. Come to the center. Sit here. Sit here quietly. No one will harm Bangladeshi Muslims. - Khairul, clear upstairs. - Come on, everyone. Go downstairs. Are you deaf? Kneel down with your heads down. Bikash, check over there. You, come here. Move it. All clear outside? Clear. All clear. - Sit down. - Mom… Cover her eyes. Thank you. You want boom-boom? Bikash, main door. Check everyone's ID. Those without an ID, make them recite any sura. ID? Kill all those who are not Bangladeshi Muslims. What's your name? - What's your name? - Zahoor. Recite a sura. "I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Satan." What's your name? Dr. Salim. Salim what? Salim Iqbal. Salim Iqbal? - Take your pants off. - But, son… I'm not your son! - Take off your pants. - Rohan! He's a senior man. Have some manners. Come forward. Don't be scared. If you're a Muslim, then recite any sura. "In the name of Allah, the one who acts with mercy. Source of mercy. May Allah, the Lord of the worlds, be praised." Sit down. Sit down. You… show some respect. Sit down. Whose guitar is this? Whose guitar is it? It belongs to him. It's mine. What's your name? Tahmid. Tahmid. Tahmid Haseeb Khan. How are they related to you? They are my cousin sisters. They are his sisters. So? Must be his sister. Not like I intended to marry her. Your fly is open. Zip it up. What are you looking at? Asshole. Zaraif, when will you learn to knock? - We... - I'm here, don't worry. Come out. Come out. Move! Okay. It's okay. - It's okay. - Come out. Okay. Go and sit over there. Move. Move. Sit down. - Sit down. - Move. Faraaz Hussain. The "Prince of Bangladesh". Who are they? They are with me. That's quite evident. But who are they? She's Shadab Aslam's sister. Please. And what about her? She's my neighbor, Rabia. Why do you know him? I don't know him. We played football a couple of times, that's it. He is educated. He studied at the university. I don't know what the fuck he is doing. Kilo 81. Come in, Kilo 81. Kilo 81 copy, sir. Kilo 81, confirm location. North Avenue, lane 83, sir. Kilo 81, reach Lake View Clinic immediately. We are getting reports of gunfire from there. Copy, sir. And Farooq, don't forget to wear your helmets and bulletproof vests. Sir, you know we've put in a request, but we've still not got any response from the head office. Okay, be safe. Copy, sir. Did you hear that? "Be safe." Let's head towards Lake View Clinic. Head down. Prince. You wanna go? Go. Hello! Where do you think you all are going? I know them, Rohan. I played football with him. So? So? He's a Muslim. What about these chicks? Let them go. Dude, just because you know him, doesn't mean they can go. We're not some nightclub bouncers here. Let them go. - Thank you. - Not the girls. Yeah, let the girls stay. What happened? Why did you change your mind? You were right. They're absolutely un-Islamic. Please, bro. Let us go. Do you want to go? The door is there. - Make them sit. - Please. No! - No, wait! - Stop it! - Please! Stop! - Stop! - Please… - Stop! - Sit down. - Stop it. - Sit the fuck down! - Down. Heads down. Move. Get back. Mobashir, position. Positions! DHAKA METROPOLITAN POLICE Why the fuck are they facing that side? All units come in. They're firing from Holey Artisan! Not Lake View Clinic. I repeat. They're firing from Holey Artisan. Not Lake View Clinic. - Stay back. Move, please. - Excuse me. - Stay back. - Excuse me, sir. - Please move. - Please, excuse me. - Please, move. - Ma'am, please move. - No one gets close. - Please, move. Ma'am, where do you think you're going? - Please move the barricades and let me in. - No one's allowed in there. - Please go outside. - Please. What is your name? Do you know who I am? - We said no. - My son's in there. - Can't you hear us? You can't go in. - Hey! - Move. - Who's your senior? - Stay back. - Call your senior. - Step back. - No one will come inside. - Leave my hand. - Step back, please. - Move. - Mom, please. - No one's allowed in. - Step back. Please move. Does it hurt a lot? You should've left quietly. Mr. Salim. Mr. Salim. Doctor! Attend to him. Let me see. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Let me see. Careful. Don't worry. Can I get an antiseptic or something? Shall I fetch it from Lake View Clinic? Does anyone have perfume or anything? - I do. - Give me. - In my bag. - Everything will be fine. - Moba. - Don't worry. Sit down. This is forbidden by Islam. It has alcohol. There's nothing else to clean the wound. May I? This will sting. Alright. Everything will be alright. Everything will be alright. Everything will be alright. Hold this, please. Over here. Tighter. Hold it. Everything will be alright. Don't worry. I can still see people in their balconies recording. Tell them to go inside. Send someone here. And why are so many people standing at the gate? Post someone here. Nobody should move in or out. What about the barricades? Okay. Make sure nobody comes in or out. No press, no civilians. The commissioner is here. Mushtaq, update me on the situation. Sir, SI Farooq was the first responder, who informed us that the gunfire, was coming from Holey Artisan. Then why was Lake View relayed to the control room? I don't know, sir, but there was a lot of chaos. Is it a hostage situation? Seems like it, sir. But no demands have been made yet. Some staff informed us that several civilians and foreign nationals are stuck inside. Where is Farooq? He's injured, sir. And we've lost three of our men. Are you out of your mind, Farooq? How could you just barge in without any planning? No bullet-proof jackets or helmets? - Sir, I was just trying to do my best... - Don't give lame excuses! Who will be accountable for the three dead officers? - Sir, we don't have new gear. - New gears? Rats have chewed out the old ones. You don't even know this, sir. Now that you've blamed the department, are you satisfied? Sorry, sir. Did anyone take responsibility for this attack? Not yet, sir. But it could be Ansar-Ul-Islam. Isn't it the same group that killed the editor of Roopabaan Magazine a few days ago? Bloody uneducated assholes! I wonder what godforsaken religious school they pick this from. How many people are inside? We don't have the exact number, but around ten people. They used an AK. - Do me a favor. - Yes, sir. - Get me a blueprint of the cafe. - Sure, sir. Let's show these swine their rightful place in Bangladesh. Sir. - Don't just stand there. Go get it! - Sure, sir. Where can we find the blueprint? Blueprint, sir? Yes, the blueprint he just mentioned. I thought you would know. You don't know where to get the blueprint? No, sir. Then why did you say yes? Even you said yes, sir. Find the blueprint. - Bikash. - Yes. Get your phone and click pictures of the bodies. Show. Show. I'm not getting the vibe. They look quite ordinarily dead. Wait. Now. Wait, give me the phone. You, rock star. - Come here. - What the fuck are you doing? Stop fucking around and just take the pictures. Dude, I know what I'm doing, okay? Come on. Quick. Now. Bend over her neck. Bend over her neck. Down. Lean closer. - Bend down. - What are you making me do, brother? Bend over now. On her neck. Please, bro. Smile. Please! Come on. Smile. Smile. Teeth. Good boy. That's more like it. What is he doing? Show it to me. Download Wickr and send the pictures to Brother Rajeev. Rest of you, back to positions. Hello, ma'am. This is Shahbaaz from Dhaka Care. We're offering life insurance… Yes, Ma'am. Can I get your details? Thank you, ma'am. Hold on for a minute, and I'll share the details with you. Yes. This is the center, and this is right and left. - Sir… - Over here… Excuse me, sir, but according to the directions, this should be left and this right. Don't get confused with right and left. We can enter from here. And over here… Sir, he's Anwar Mehendi. So? Sir, he's the owner of the cafe. Mr. Anwar, did you get the blueprint? Sir, I looked all over, but couldn't find it. Are you sure you didn't hand it to the terrorists? Sorry, sir? You know what, Farooq, take him along, and make a layout of the cafe. And set up a command post. Okay? And, don't leave him alone. Go. Sir, I am here to help. Then help us! Quick, get out of here. - He's so rude. - Come. Come on. - Get two teams ready. - Sir. Let's finish them off. There are civilians inside, sir. Wouldn't it be better to be careful? This is the Commissioner of Police. I repeat, this is the Police Commissioner. The cops have surrounded you. There's no way to escape. We're ready to hear your demands. Release all the hostages safe and sound. I repeat, there's no way to escape. Who the fuck has written this? Sir, it is a standard protocol. We'll be okay. We'll be safe. We'll get out. This is the Police Commissioner speaking. Release all the hostages safe and sound. We're ready to hear your demands. I repeat. We're ready to hear your demands. Sir, SWAT, and RAB teams - are on their way. - So are we supposed to swat mosquitoes until then? Yes, Rabia, I can hear you. Yes. We're right here. Come near the barricades. Yeah, I'm right in the crowd. Yeah. Come. Come here. There she is. Where are the children? - Are the children okay? - Dr. Mujahid is trying to get through the commissioner. The kids will come out safe. Just hang in there. Sir, this is the main gate, and this is the boundary wall. Please move your hand. - Go on. - This leads to the parking area, sir. And this is the lake area, and this is the lawn. This is the cafe's entry. This is the seating area. And this is the courtyard. And the kitchen is over here. But we were told that the kitchen is somewhere here. Oh! - Sorry, sir. But this is the kitchen. - Are you sure you own the cafe? - Sorry, sir. - Your job here is done. Go on. Leave. Go on. - Everyone, come here. - Sir. Listen carefully. Team one will enter with me from the main gate, and we'll try to divert their attention. Clear? Team two will jump into the lawn from the side, and take them by surprise. - Clear to everyone? - Yes, sir. Let's surround the assholes from both sides. But sir, you'll be directly in the line of fire. No wonder I'm the Police Commissioner. What is he still doing here? Out! Someone escort him out. No one enters the war room without my permission. Sure, sir. Staff! Where's the switchboard? Line everyone up. Line them up in front of the windows. Bikash, Khairul, quick! Come on! Quick, get up. Against the window, go. Come on. Khairul! Go on. To the back. What are you doing? - Do you want to get shot again? - What kind of question is that? Shut the fuck up and do what I'm telling you to do. I'm protecting you here. Go, stand there. Moba, main door. Khairul, all good? And you, on the main door. Go. You two, come here. Come here. You'll be fine. Come with me. You'll be fine. Under the stairs. Come on. Do you want to stand in front of the windows? Come here. Be careful. Come here. Under the stairs. Nothing will happen. Slow down. Go under the stairs. Hide under it. You, against the window. My hand, dude. Doctor, check him. Grew a fucking beard, you should've grown a pair while you were at it. We will see when you get shot. Hey, long hair. Against the main door. Go fast. How much longer? Hello! Hello, Tari? Dad… Tari, I can't hear you. Give me the phone. Hello, Uncle. Faraaz here. Yes. We'll get out safe and sound. Call my mom… - and tell her we will get out... - Please, Faraaz. Teach your kids some manners. They're taking my politeness for granted. What the fuck is wrong with you? How brainwashed are you! You're brainwashed. Everyone in this circus has been brainwashed. When everyone is gone from this world… we will be remembered. Just watch. Move! Move in, boys. Move in. I want men stationed at every corner of this area. Assailants in sight. Cover every inch of this place. - Give me a visual. - Sir. - Copy. - We were just waiting for you, sir. DMP should not have attacked! Sir. I tried, sir. Keep an eye on the target. If anything, let me know immediately. I tried to reason with the Commissioner, but… Now you guys have made our job even more difficult! I want men stationed there. What is the ETA on RAB? They should be here any moment, sir. Boys, any activity, report in. - Negative. - I do not want any fuck up this time. Where is the command post? This way, sir. I need water. Wait. Hey! Go, look after your kids. Go sit with them. Dad, water. We'll drink once we get home. I don't want to be here. Let's go home, Dad. We'll drink water, have a burger, and even watch a movie together, okay? I promise. What's your fucking problem, you creep? Stop throwing English words at me. - She's abusing me in English, man. - Careful, Mobu. - Or she will slap you again. - Look after yourself first. You got shot. Getting shot is glorious, okay. - You got slapped by a fucking chick! - I will… Hey! Avoid. Avoid him. Go and stand there. Go there. Go. And Faraaz, if I shoot her in the face for talking too much, it will be on you. Okay? I am currently at Gulshan Chaar Rasta. This is the same area where an unfathomable attack has taken place. - The Bangalesh Police - My daughter's in there. - Is not taking any further steps. - There's nothing we can do, sir. - You have to wait here. - My name is Sudhir Sen. - I can understand. - I am from India. I am not a local. I dropped my daughter off at the cafe. When I came back, this had happened. - Please, sir. - There's nothing we can do, sir. - Please leave. - Let me talk to your senior? I will request him. - Maybe he'll listen to me. - It's not allowed, sir. Please go. No one's allowed now, sir, please. Please leave. Stand back, please. Please. No one is allowed to enter the premises. And we have a person here with us. Sir, we had some questions. Is any of your kin in there? My daughter's in there. I left her here. And I came back to this terror. - What is her name? - Tarika Sen. When did you last talk to her? - A while ago. - Did you meet her inside the cafe? I am telling you I dropped my daughter off here. How could you leave her in such a situation? Why would I intentionally leave my daughter here? I went out for some work. When I came back, this was going on. As you can see, - the situation here is tense. - How dare you ask me such a question? - The cops have no answers yet… - I am here. - And there's anger among people. - I am right here. Yes, please note it. Faraaz Ayaaz Hussain. Yes. Grandson of Lateef-Ul-Rehman. Yes, grandson. - Yes. - Excuse me. Yes, I'm right here. Yes. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. - Are you Faraaz's mother? - Yes. I am Tarika's dad. Sudhir. Sudhir Sen. - Mr. Sen, yes. - Yes. Faraaz and Tarika are stuck inside together. I know, Mr. Sen. Don't worry. The kids will come out safely. - Dr. Mujahid, Mr. Sen. - Yes. Dr. Mujahid is the CEO of our pharma company. This is Zaraif, my older son. She's… Ayesha's mother, Rabia. We're all trying our best. But we haven't been able to talk to the kids yet. I actually spoke to Faraaz. Is he fine? He's fine. He said not to worry, and that they'll all come out safely. That's my son. Manirul. We have our men stationed in all the buildings around Holey Artisan's perimeter. Snipers are manning the roof, but unfortunately, we don't have a clear vision yet. How many terrorists are in there? No idea, sir. Captives? No idea, sir. Benazir, good you're here. Let's regroup and attack again. I guess there aren't more than five terrorists inside. - We can... - You guess?! Thanks to you, we've already lost 12 officers. He's right, sir. We cannot plan another failed attack. What else should we do? We can't just sit on our hands while our people remain captive inside. You're injured. It'd be better if you step back. We'll make a plan keeping the civilians in mind. We made the plan keeping the civilians in mind. Sir, stop calling your stupidity a plan. Mind your language, Benazir. Sir, let's discuss the way ahead. We've blocked all the routes. Okay. Will you show me Holey Artisan's layout? Sure. What is this? Where is the blueprint? This is all we have. Seriously? Wow! Isn't this amazing? Who is this local Picasso? Commissioner, send a recon team. They will assess the situation around the cafe, and report to me. RAB will join SWAT on the rooftop, and windows for maximum visuals. The rest will be ground support. Manirul, we will lead. SWAT will attack from the front, and RAB will enter from back here. And what about DMP? DMP will be the back up team and give us cover fire when required. If any armed terrorist comes out, shoot at sight. Sir. And Manirul, there's something else you need to know as well. After the operation… I want this framed. Ma'am, he's SI Farooq. Inspector? Why should I be speaking to an Inspector? - Where is the commissioner? - Ma'am, he's a little bit busy. Look, we've been waiting for a long time. This is Rabia. This is Mr. Sen from India. Our kids are stuck inside. We're here to cooperate with you, and to give you all sorts of moral support. - But we also need to know... - Thank you. Thank you for all that, ma'am. If you need anything, you can tell me. Or you can tell Dr. Mujahid. - Yes, it will be taken care of. - Whatever they require. Absolutely. It will be taken care of. But how long will this rescue operation take? We're trying, ma'am. Yes, but it's been over three hours, and now people are beginning to panic. Ma'am, there are 50 people stuck inside the cafe. All we're trying to do is make sure, that everybody comes out safely, that's it. Of course! But there's got to be a plan of action, right? - Please let us do our job. - I'm sure you can do it better. These are terrorists, and our children are inside. And many more innocent people, and… Should we just blow up the cafe then? Everyone will be dead. Game over! That's it. Everybody goes home? Twelve officers are dead, ma'am. I'm injured but still on duty. Do you know why? Why? Only to make sure everyone comes out safely. But no, you know it better. Please do it for us. Sir, please. - Please, sir… - Please let us do our job! As you can see the RAB and SWAT teams have reached the spot. Per our sources, many DMP officers are severely injured. We have to wait and see how exactly the hostages will be rescued. This attack in the country's diplomatic area has been termed Bangladesh's biggest terrorist attack to date. So far, no terrorist organization has claimed responsibility for it. This is Mohammad Sami-Ull reporting for ATN News. Nibras, any message from Brother Rajeev? We will get it soon. Complicated network. Dude, I got shot in the hand. We're risking our lives here. The least he can do is reply on time. Hey, long hair. Everyone's sleepy. Play something. And none of that Bob Dylon, John Lennon bullshit. Khairul, do you have any requests? For you, my heart pines What about that one? I don't know the chords. What do you know? I play my own songs. Really? One of those. Play something. I... I remained quiet And resilient Even as God stood witness To the atrocities I stayed empathetic And untainted And yet I felt suffocated Can't do it. I'm not a professional singer. I only write songs. So what? They are not here for a concert. Just sing. Sing. I swear I'll never set up a date for anyone again. Clouds of smoke and gunpowder Faces smeared in blood But who will hear My heart's woes? I've seen monsters turn into men There's a sea of pain inside of me Slowly chipping away at the pieces Of my heart Nobody stood up Nobody called them out Even God stood witness To the atrocities I remained quiet and resilient Even God stood witness To the atrocities You were right. You're definitely not a professional singer. I'm kidding! Go sit. A round of applause. Come on, louder! Go and sit down. Team Theta, you will throw stun grenades inside the cafe, to make way for Team Alpha to enter. - Copy! - Yes, sir. Try to lure the terrorists out, and then get them. Ensure that none of the hostages are hurt in the crossfire. - Clear? - Yes, sir! He's blaming me for everything. Now they are doing the same thing. Doesn't matter which point you enter from, you'll be spotted anyway. - I was right in front of them. - Sir. - Sir. - What is it? Ma'am is on the line. Tell ma'am there's been a terrorist attack. - I'll be late for dinner. - The Prime Minister. What? Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Yes. - Mushtaq. - Sir. What? Why are they coordinating with you? They should be calling me. Why don't you call her yourself then? When there was time to negotiate, you attacked. Now when we're prepared to attack, you want us to negotiate? It's not me who's saying this. These are her orders. Directly from the PM. Alright then, let's get some coffee and snacks. Let's "follow" orders. There were two of my other staff, who jumped from the roof. And my other staff, they got shot. I just want to go to the embassy. Do you want to go to the embassy? Yes, I want to go to the embassy of my country. Hey, you guys, those near the windows. Come and sit. Come on, stand against the window. Stand against the wall. Sit comfortably on the chair. You, go stand in front of the window. Doctor, against the wall. Hey, you two. Come and sit here. Hey, you've rested enough. Go. Go stand there in front of the wall and take these two with you. You go and stand against that window. I am sorry. I am so sorry. If only I had left for Malaysia, we wouldn't be here. It's all my fault. As if it was your fault that the ink got over. I'm sorry. You guys came to see me. Don't say that. It was my plan to come here. I am sorry. You know, snow isn't a problem in most Islamic countries. But "ISIS". Terrorist jokes, really? You shouldn't be joking like this. Sorry. I couldn't think of anything else. Nibras. Confirm and tell me how many are dead. - Moba, outside. Bikash, upstairs. - Wait, I'll count. No. You just watch them. You stay here to guard. I will do the counting. Why don't you count this? Go count, and hurry up. One. "In the name of Allah, the most gracious and the most merciful. Oh, Allah. By the Quran, full of wisdom. You are indeed one of the messengers." Two. "I worship you, the three-eyed Lord Shiva. The one who is fragrant and has nourished all beings." Three. You count yours. "On a straight path. It is a revelation sent down by Him. You may warn those whose forefathers weren't warned, they are unaware. - Of the signs of Allah." - Four. "Free me from the bondage of this worldly life. Free me from the fear of death. - By making me realize…" - Five. How many? Fourteen. Six. - Sir, he's… - Sir, we live close by. My daughter Fairuz is stuck inside! Please get her out. We're trying our best. Give me your daughter's number. Whose is it? Whose phone is it? Who is it? It's an unknown number. Come. Come here. I won't hurt you. Come here! Fast. Answer the call. Put it on loudspeaker. - Hello. - Fairuz. This is Benazir Ahmed speaking from RAB. Is everyone alright? Can I talk to someone? What the fuck are you doing? - Dude, it's the fucking RAB… - What the fuck is wrong with you? - RAB, dude. They're going to screw us. - Shut the fuck up! They are going to fuck us! Just shut the fuck up! Call them back and put it on the loudspeaker. Fucking idiot. - Hello. - Hello. Tell him he's on the loudspeaker. Uncle, you're on the loudspeaker. This is DG RAB. Tell me your demands. I'll consider them. I know you're scared as well, because I would be too. Think calmly. I just want to know your point of view. I'm sure you did it for a specific reason. And for that you need to come out. And I assure you no one will harm you. Hello? Hello? Turn on the TV. Bikash, Mobashir, come here. Also you, idiot. We begin with breaking news… Breaking news, terror attack… Gunmen walked into the Holey… Heavily armed militants… Terror attack in a restaurant… Dhaka is shaken. - ISIS. - ISIS… ISIS is claiming responsibility… ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack, and declared that 19 people are dead, including foreign nationals. Through their official mouthpiece Amaq Agency, they have also shared pictures of the terrorists, who are still present inside the cafe. These five terrorists are believed to be Bangladeshi nationals. According to reports, the names of these five terrorists are, Nibras Islam, Rohan Imtiaz, Khairul Payel, Meer Mobashir, and Bikash Shafiqul. We don't have any information on the sixth terrorist seen in the picture, but we'll be closely following this developing story. This… They handed guns to children on a jummah. And these assholes claim to be the custodians of Islam. Have you guys shut their internet service? - Sir, the chaos... - Chaos? You guys are trained officers, Manirul.

They have jammed the network. What? How will we coordinate with Brother Rajeev? Staff. You. What's the Wi-Fi password? Holeyartisan12345. Holeyartisan12345? You guys are pretty serious about your security. Bloody losers. They've shut down mobile data but broadband is working at full speed. Boys, we have received a message from Brother Rajeev. "I am so proud of you. You've delivered more than we expected. There's a special place for you reserved in heaven now. You've proved that even Muslims from Bangladesh are ahead in the war for Islam. See you soon in paradise. Love you all." On this note, let's take a selfie. Take his phone. Take his phone. Yes. Open it. - Hold it. - No, please… - Why are you doing this to me? - Hold it. Smile. - Who are you? How did you get in? - Sir, she's Lateef-Ul-Rehman's daughter. - So? Who allowed her? - She has permission from the Ministry. Our kids are inside. I've been standing out here for hours. There are other parents too... Look ma'am, you guys are not allowed in here. Why am I not allowed here? - My son is stuck in there! - Ma'am, we're working on a plan of action. - Please move away! - What plan of action? You're doing nothing. You're chilling, smoking a cigarette. My son's stuck in there all night. If you guys are incapable, then let me know. - I will go in. - Get them out here. - What? - Sir, please try to understand. Please. I will get you suspended! I will call the PM right now - and get you suspended! - Mom, wait.

We need to bring back those who have deviated from the path of Sharia. And kill the infidels. "All who obey Allah and the messenger, will be in the company of those on whom the Allah has graced, of the prophets who teach the sincere lovers of truth, the witnesses who testify, and the righteous who do good." What beautiful company! Do you know what it means? Those who obey… Not the one you've mugged up. Those who believe in the Grace of Allah will be enlisted among those special ones whom Allah has personally blessed. Nabi-e-Kareem Mohammad. Our Great Prophet, may Allah honor him, and grant the martyrs peace. Wow! What a company to be in! Even he's parroting what he's been fed. What are you saying? He's making it sound like Allah has made an executive club, and he's getting a gold membership. That's such a bad analogy. They think they get blessings by killing the innocent. Are you hungry? Moba. There should be pastries and croissants at the counter. Have a look. It's covered in blood. Staff. Where do you keep the food? Get out. Please. Please. Don't kill. Hello. - Hello, Dad. - Hello. Nobody is helping us here. Please do something. I've done everything I could. We are helpless. We can't go against God's will. How can we not?! You have to do something! I don't care! Do whatever it takes! Call the Defense Minister. Call the army. If you have to sell everything to pay them off, do it. I… want my Chhotu back right now. Otherwise, I'll never show you my face again, I'm telling you! My dear, all we can do is pray that our boy comes out safe. Leave him. Why? I spared his life. What do you mean? I mean, I spared his life. Dude, you're impossible. So Mr. Chef, what's your name? Sardar. But it says Sarkar here. It's a misprint. It's Sardar Khan. Sardar Khan. So, Chef Sardar Khan, what will you cook for us? Are we going to have food before we leave? Where are we going? It's time for the morning prayers, everyone must be hungry. Come on, go with him. And you, sit down there. On your knees. Can you keep that away? I'm getting scared. Moba, do you have your phone? Chef, give me your phone. I want to play games. Do you have Temple Run? Yes… no. Give it! Do you think we're here to steal phones? Sarkar. Keep cooking. You know, there was a time when Islam ruled the world. All the Muslims lived in golden palaces. We had the best clothes, the best food, and the best toys. Come on. Come. We made big missiles, and our army was the strongest. Hey, Hiroshima! Here, on your knees. Come, sit. Then some folks got jealous of us. Hold the gun. Please. No. And they took everything from us. Don't you want all of it back? Stop. Stop it! He's a kid. Exactly. Are you okay?

Some fancy American University? So that's what they taught you there. How to finish off Islam? That is all you know. It's written in the Quran. Yeah. Ijtihad. It means reasoning. Allah wants us to question, doubt, and challenge. But how would you know? You've not even read the Quran, right? No need to teach me anything. I know everything. They made a fool of you. They cherry-picked some verses, gave them a twisted interpretation, and handed you a gun. They taught you violence, not Islam. Watch it. I wasn't taught anything, it was my choice to be here. Do you not see, bro? Islam is under threat. In America, Obama has awarded himself the Nobel Peace Prize, while he is bombing us in seven countries? Palestine doesn't belong to the Palestinians. Kashmir doesn't belong to the Kashmiris. Our people are getting killed every single day in Yemen. Millions of us are being caged in China's detention camps People climb on mosques and demolish them, and then call Muslims violent. People don't even consider us humans. Is this the kind of world you want to live in? And by doing all this will you stop the cycle? We suffer because of people like you. Everyone thinks we're violent radicals, just like you. - Just... - If they target us, we will hit back! This is a message to every Bangladeshi. We're opening up a new battlefront here.

The army must have arrived now. RAB is already here. We don't know what's out there. We'll get fucked. You're getting shit scared, right? You're freaking scared. How dare you point your gun at me, Mobashir! Sister. It's me, Nibras. Dude, Nibras, what are we waiting for? Let's get the hell out of here. Just wait downstairs. I'm coming. What's the plan? How do we escape? We made a decision when we came here. We're not running away. But why not? The cops are here! We're in front of a lake. I can swim. We all can. Dude, let's go. We'll swim to the other side. We'll settle down in Malaysia with our parents. We're not going anywhere, okay? We're going to paradise. You're going to paradise. I am going out. You can leave. Go on.

But you prayed with me. Faraaz… go. We'll be fine. Go. I can't leave without them. What the fuck is your problem? What do you want, man? I want my Islam back from people like you. Great. You'll be an example for the rest of the Muslims. Fine, I can live with that. No! In a world far away from our own In a promised land beyond this realm In another universe I hope you've found a safe home Kinder than the one you've foregone Where the carefree ones live In a world far away from our own In another universe I hope, my dear, you've found a home - We'll avenge the murders… - By spilling their blood. - We'll avenge the murders… - By spilling their blood. - We'll avenge the murders… - By spilling their blood. - We'll avenge the murders… - By spilling their blood. - We'll avenge the murders… - By spilling their blood. I did nothing, sir. I wasn't… I did nothing, sir. Sir, please. Ask my parents, sir. I'm just a student, sir. Please. A world Where people don't look For religion in a name In a world far away from our own In a new universe I hope you've found a safe home Chhotu always followed his heart. He was stubborn. Never agreed on anything easily. MOTHER TERESA MEMORIAL AWARDS FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE, 2016 Now I wish… even if to argue with me, once… if he could just come back. I was there. Right there. But… I... I couldn't save him. It all seems so unreal, so unfair. How can I continue living… when my child is no more? The moment I found out that no foreigner had survived. I realized… that my son won't walk out. He won't walk out… without his friends… Ayesha and Tarika. What those five kids did… or whoever made them do it. Because of people like them, the world keeps saying, "See, they did it yet again. This is just how their community is." But my Chhotu proved… not all battles are fought to be won. Some are just fought so the world can remember… that when there was injustice… someone stood up against it. Those officers stood against them. My Chhotu stood up against them. I know you can hear me, Chhotu. I want you to know… that your mother is very proud of you. Because now I know… it takes a mob… to divide the world. But to keep it united… one adorable… loving… child is enough. His very name… Faraaz. Means someone who stands tall. My Chhotu stood for the ones he loved. Will you?
