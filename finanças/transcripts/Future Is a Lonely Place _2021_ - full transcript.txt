-Don't! -He's my brother-in-law. -Get back inside! -Just a sec. I'll be right back. You need help, Frank? What's wrong? Where did you want to go? Hey! What are you doing? Your gun. Your gun. Stop that bullshit. This isn't funny. Put it on the ground. -What? You gonna shoot me now? -Put the gun down. Put your gun on the ground. Please, do it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Go to the back. -Okay. -Now! -Okay. -Just do it. You should've told us if you needed money. -That's not it. -Don't do this. Open the door. -Frank! please, don't. -Give me the money. I don't get you. What should I tell your sister now? I'm sorry. FUTURE IS A LONELY PLACE Name? Moha Nejem. Date of birth? 15/12/95. First time in an adult correctional facility. -Name? -Frank Paulsen. -Date of birth? -19/01/79. You, come with me. Thank you. Your jewelry, too. Open your mouth. Tongue up. Okay. Pull your underpants down to your knees. Bend forward. Legs further apart. Thanks. You can pull them up now. You can keep the ring. The watch will stay with the rest of your belongings. You won't need it in here. These are your things. Take them with you. There's a photo in my wallet. Could I have it, please? You can go get dressed now. Upstairs, to the right. Your cell is 2.19. Yard time is at 3 pm. Hey! What's your name? Are you deaf or what? -I'm Miki. -Watch it, man. Son of a bitch. Hey! Keep walking. What's going on? You having a gathering? Okay? Keep moving. Okay, men. Hurry up! Fresh air is waiting. Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey! Take it easy, man. -Hey, Walter. -Hey, Peter. C'mon, move over. You see that? Always the same. Anyone send you money? No one sends you stuff? Shit. But you've got a girlfriend, right? You're a handsome guy. No girlfriend? Fuck, fuck? I don't have any money. -You're stingy. -I have no money. You don't wanna share, do you? We share everything here. We all do. Well, you're on your own then, bro. Hey, Miki. Something's going on there. Mr. Paulsen. Take a seat. Five years is a long time. Suffer from any health problems? Are you on any medication? Drugs? Alcohol? No. Addicted to gambling? Suicidal thoughts? Good. We don't need any of that here. Do you have any family on the outside? -Just my sister. -Excuse me? Just my sister. How will you be paying your way here? By finding work, as soon as possible. Not much work on the outside, not much work in here. I'll try to find a job for you. -Any questions? -No. You may go, then. Once more, and the ball is gone. It tastes like shit here. -Looking for something? -Can I have the photo back? Your little bastard? Check this out. Frank's missus. Surely being fucked by an Arab now. Just give it back, okay? Hey! That's enough! -Beat it! -Nothing happened. -Beat it! -Nothing happened. C'mon. Get up. Come with me. It's just three Euro an hour. You won't get rich in here. -How long you in for? -Five years. And you? I'll be out in four months. I have to take care of my daughter. She's two. Her mother ran off. You have any kids? -No, I don't. -Well, I need to become clean first. -Give me that. -Which wing are you in? They put me with the Arabs, because I'm a Muslim. That's how things work here. -You know their boss? -Fuad? Why you asking? No reason. If you're smart, you'll stay away from him. -Here's 10,000. -That's it? -We're not the only ones who sell in here. -Are you screwing with Jamil? -What can he do? He needs me. -And you need me. Are you threatening me? I don't want any trouble with your brother. You can quit at any time. It's your choice. Here's your share. Does Rashid's family know the money's coming from you? That won't bring him back. Farid! Yes, I'm here. I need backup at 2.19. The inmate is behaving suspiciously. There might be shards of glass on the ground. Hard to see. Paulsen, please step outside. I'm going to search you. Turn around. Hands on the wall, legs apart. Okay. You may turn around. Thiel? There's nothing here. Then I must've made a mistake. My bad. -Are the others bothering you? -It's under control. They won't leave you alone. Planning on making yourself a weapon? Look after yourself. Careful. It's hot. What happened? I fell. -Do they often do that to you? -What's it to you? I owe money, okay? Nothing to speak of. To Fuad? What's your deal with Fuad? Why you keep asking about him? I know where they hide drugs. From your wing? I want to talk to him. Tell him that. Well? What are you two up to? -We're just talking. -Piss off! Go talk to your own kind. Everything's fine. You be careful now, okay? Don't make friends with the wrong people. -Seen Eddy? I need to talk to him. -Then go find him. What's going on? You want to talk to me? What about? Say something. Open your mouth. -I want in. -Just like that? I need money. You stole the stuff from Walter, right? Where is it? Behind the kitchen. Buried by the trash. Okay. And now? I don't do business with jerks like you. Any problems here? No, no problem. Everything's fine. You got a problem? I don't want to see you here again. Got it? Is everything okay? I brought this for you. I know what happened to your family. From your file. You're not a big talker, are you? Depends on the subject. Most here try to build a relationship. They seek contact. Want to get things off their chests. But you don't say a word. You go to everyone's cell, or do I get special treatment? I know that it can be really lonely in here. We're also locked up. My name is Susanna Thiel. I'd like to make an appointment. Regarding a termination of pregnancy. Ninth. Okay. Thank you. Yes, goodbye. You bastard! Where's the dope? -Where? You piece of shit! -I don't know anything! -Wanker! Tell us! -I know nothing! Tell us! That will do. I don't know. Heard you had quite a good talk with that nigger yesterday. -What did you talk about? -I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. You think we don't know what you're up to? You're working for those damn Arabs. -I don't... -Think we're stupid? -Does it look like we're stupid? -Please, stop! Where's my dope? Where's my dope? Eddy! Eddy! You owe me five grand for screwing me over. You fool. Guards! Guards! Someone is lying there. He is bleeding. -Where is he? -In the backyard. Someone's been beaten up here! Call the paramedics! -Was it you who found him? -Yes. Did you see anything? -No. -What did you see? Nothing. I'm sorry. -What are you sorry about? -Hey! Hey! It wasn't him, man. -Was it you? You're in the same wing. -No! -You've beaten him up? -No! -Or did he? -It wasn't... -Tell me! -It wasn't me and it wasn't him, man! Let go of me, damn screw! -Yeah, tell me something new. -Hey! 2.19, I'm listening. Can I talk to you? Move away from the door so I can come in. I know who attacked Eddy. Did you hear what I just said? Hey! Did you hear what I just said? Do you understand what I said? I heard nothing. Strauss won't do anything about it. Last year there was a young inmate here. He'd just come of age. He wanted me to help him. And now his parents no longer have a son. You can't tell anyone. Promise me. Yes. You're all alone in here. I don't want anything to happen to you. I don't want to be saved. The cigarettes. You can keep them. I don't need any help. -Did you go see the new guy? -It's his first prison sentence. Armed robbery. -Is that all you've found out? -What do you want to know? I'm not asking because you work for me, but because I trust you. Can I trust you? He doesn't belong here. Jamil wants you to solve the problem with the Germans. I heard you've lost something. I can give it back to you. What do you say? And what do you want in return? Independence? Being here... It's for the last time. When I get out, I'll be done with all this shit. I'll start my own thing. I need money in order to do that. And I won't have much of that if it all goes straight to my brother. Get me? And how do I come into play? I get the stuff directly from your source. You'll get 20% of the proceeds from my wing. Screw your wing. How much does Miki's sister smuggle into here? How often? What is it? Once a month? I have a jailer in my pocket. And I have a boy in the kitchen. He'll take care of the rest. Think about it. Katja. Hey, it's me. Frank. Katja? I just wanted to ask how you are. Yeah, well... I'm also fine. You don't need to worry about me. Katja? I can't tell you right now. Bye. I'm so sorry. I have to hang up now. Forgive me. -I'm still waiting for my money. -I can't pay you. -I don't think you understand. -Let go of me. I can kill him for you. -Kill whom? -Let go of me. Fuad. Fuad? You can make more if he's gone. --Let go of me. -I'm curious. -And why would you do that? -It's personal. Think about it. -No need. -Good. What's your problem? Which side are you on anyway? I didn't realize there were sides here. Want me to tell you why the Arabs like you? Because they think with their balls. Don't think I'll treat you differently because you are a woman. My shift's about to start. Are you avoiding me? And why would I do that? How long have you been working here? -You should've transferred him. -Still on about 3.20? His name was Rashid. We've gone over this. These things happen. "These things happen?" He hanged himself in his cell. He was scared. I hope it was worth it for you. Can I have one? Did you know that most inmates keep their curtains drawn? They don't want to see the bars. Looks good. It looks like a dove. And now... Here comes the butterfly. Towards the light a little. Try again. -Where are you guys? -We're gone. What? -We're not here. -We're down the drain. I have a ticket. I can enter. -Okay. -Bedtime. -That's right! It's bedtime! -Oh, no! Off to bed. Come on. -I don't want to go to bed. -How about a bedtime story? -Yes! -Very well. -Great... Show us what you've got. -Go on. -Okay. -Show us. There's a butterfly called Rosie and her friend is an eagle. His name is Hugo. And what is Hugo doing? Friday prayer and our church service are taking place in the same corridor. So, you'll go to church and listen to what the priest has to say. When you're being brought back, stall. Tie your shoelaces or something. Stay at the back, so they don't notice you. Are you listening to me? You've got to be quick. When Fuad walks past you... stab him right here. So! Anyone fancy a game? Hey! What's going on? Why do we have to wait so long? Your time will come. You fucking fascist. Go inside. What was that? I said, "You fucking fascist". Say it again. "Be gracious to me, Oh God, according to Your lovingkindness; according to the greatness of Your compassion blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin, for I do know my transgressions, and my sins..." I don't get it. You don't get anything at all. Then tell me. What are we doing here? My daughter... was eight. She was eight years old. You just left her there to die. You... just left her there to die. Yes. -Okay! I'm ready. Let's go. -Off you go. -Will you join us later? -Absolutely not. -I'm off. -Let me help you. -Oh, come on. I'm fine. -Okay. Bye. -Bye. See you tomorrow. -Can't wait. Me neither. Bye. Damn it, Fuad! Come on! Fuad! Hey. Hey! Hey! No! No! Maren! Lara! Maren... Help! Help! Maren, my little girl. You'll be okay. Everything's fine. Help! Paramedics! I need the paramedics! Sit down. Sit down! It's only a matter of time before one of them talks. Yeah, right. What do you want? -Nothing. -A bigger TV? More visiting hours? Day release? There's nothing you can give me. You've spent more time inside than out! You know exactly what happened there! No, I don't. Can I go now? Get out of here. How old are you? You're still nothing more than a henchman. The little brother. Were you involved? -Did you do this? -Calm down. Did you attack him? Happy now? Forget him. -Jamil is out. We're doing it without him. -He won't allow that. -Can I count on you? -You're making a mistake! If I go down, so do you. Welcome back. Management wants to talk to you. So, you didn't see who attacked you? Mr. Paulsen, could you identify anyone? Do you owe money? Can you protect me? Can you guarantee that nothing will happen to me? Why were you in the mosque anyway? I want to go to my cell. Getting fatter and fatter? You screwed me over. You betrayed me to Fuad, you asshole. Where do you think you are? If you pull any shit on me or open your mouth... I'll come to your cell and kill you. And I'll do it right. Bread? Yes, please. I wanted to see how you're doing. You have to stay out of people's business. Please. I'm sorry. Please, stay. You know I can't. -Hey. -What were you talking about with Miki? Why do you ask? What have you got there, Moha? Stay away! Stay away! Hey! They'll fuck me up. -Frank, please, stop! -Give me that. -I just want home! Please! -Give me that. -Tell Fuad he has to get it from me. -Please, Frank. Chill. I want to get out of here alive. I didn't mean to do that. Put pressure on it. Put pressure! Out of the cells and against the wall! Cell search in A Wing! Go to your cells, immediately! Against the wall. Slowly, my friend. -Those fucking Arabs stab each other... -Hands on the wall, legs apart. Great. There's one less of them. You like that, don't you? You fucking faggot. Search. Search. C'mon. Get a move on! Hands on the wall! -Come here. -You have two of them. -Search. -Hands off the girls, okay? -The brunette's called Melly. -Hey. Hands on the wall. Hey! Hands on the wall! We found this in 2.18. Not the hair. I can cut off a small lock of hair for you. Yeah? What do you say? There will be disciplinary action, just so we're clear. I'm not done with you yet. The whole building will be turned inside out, every knife will be bagged, and then we'll quickly find our culprit! What the hell is going on here? The boy you work with... He's okay. Get out. Walk a bit faster. Follow my colleague. You work for Jamil? Off we go, my friends! Greetings from your brother. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Pick up. Do you want me dead or what? What's going on? I'm your brother! -Don't try to fool me again. -I'm your brother. -You understand? -Shut up! I'm going to get out and I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you, man! 1.78, I'm listening. Hello? -1.78, what do you want? -Come! We're going in. It'll hurt less if you stop resisting. -Calm down. -How's Ines? I fuck your family! Fuck you! Who are you fucking, huh? Who? Who's fucking whom, huh? Who's fucking whom? What are you up to tonight? Same old, you know me! Sit in front of the TV and eat through a pizza? I'm telling you: you need a family! Here comes our little night owl. Is there anything I should know? We've locked up 1.78. You shouldn't let them intimidate you, Thiel. You have to set an example. Here's to us and to the job no one wants to do! Cheers, dude. Cheers. I didn't think you'd come. They won't keep you here forever. Then what? You have to get me out. They're going to kill me. -I warned you. -I'm dying here. Is that what you want? Is that what you want? I'm pregnant, Fuad. And I'm going to keep it. If I get you out of here, then I want you to leave me and the child alone. I'll give you money. No, I'm coming home now. Lock the door when you're going to bed. Please, Ines. It's important. Yes. Love you, too. You're not doing the rounds, Thiel? Give my regards to Ines. Sure I will. -What's going on out there? -The Arabs have a new boss. -What about Fuad? -He won't be here tomorrow. What do you mean? What does that mean? -Let go of me. -Where is he going? -Where is he going? -I came to say goodbye. I won't be coming back. Are you running off together? I have to go. Wait. Why are you doing this? Why are you helping him? -I have no choice. -Thiel? -Don't go alone. Take me with you. -I can't. I can't stay here. Take me with you. -What's going on, Thiel? -Nothing. Everything's fine. Give me your piece. The radio, too. Put it on the floor. On the floor! And now go inside. -Don't make any mistakes now, Paulsen. -Inside. Now! How long do you think it will take them to find you? Come on. Quickly. Come on! Answer! Come. What the hell's going on? What's going on, man? We need to hurry. Come on. Get down. Keep your head down! Hey. I signed off earlier. Reuter's taking over my shift. Okay, thanks. I'll open the gate for you. You haven't told her. I don't want to involve her in this. You don't want her to hate you. That's all. We need another car. -It's the end of the road for him. -He's coming with us. Are you fucking him? Frank, that's enough. Frank, that's enough! The money is at my father's. I hid it there from Jamil. I'll drive. What is it? Those are Jamil's guys. -Hey. I'm looking for Jamil. -For whom? Jamil. -There's no Jamil here. -Come on. Just tell me where he is. -I've never seen you before. -I'm Fuad's friend. I have a message from him. We did time together. -Jamil is on his way. -I'll deliver it to his father then. -Why not to us? -I promised him, okay? Open up. It's me. I know you're in there. Want me to just stand here? Open the fucking door! What are you doing here? You've got no business here anymore. What's all this about? I busted my gut for 30 long years. And for what? To raise a criminal? What's that? It's money. Never seen it before, have you? You could never afford anything. No one's ever respected you. No one. I'm sorry you're so ashamed of me. -What have you done? -Nothing. -What did you do? -Nothing! That should do for a start. So, that's it? Are you going to leave us alone? I'm out of your life. Frank! The cops are coming! The cops! Police. We have to go. -He's coming with us. -What? No! Get up. Get up. Take him with you, please. Get up. Take the money. Take it all. He's my son! This way. My car's over here. Please, take care of him. Pull over. I'll get off here. Hey! I want to get out. -You won't get far. -What do you care? Frank, let me out! Are you deaf or what? You'll need it. -Keep it. -I didn't do it for the money. Bite on this. Bite on it! -Where is he? -What is this, Frank? -Why were you in prison? -Where is he? What do you want from Fuad? Tell me. No. Let him go. Don't hurt him. I have no choice. He murdered my family. Frank. Frank! Get out. Frank! Frank! Let him go! -That way. -What do you want? -Move it! -Frank! -I told you to move it! -Let him go! Frank! Frank! Go on. Go on! Go on. Keep going. Keep going. Come on. -What do you want, man? -Get in. -Get in there! -No! -I'm so sorry. -I've lost everything. I've got nothing left. I've got nothing left! Are you scared? Are you scared? I'm sorry. Do you understand now what you did? Don't look at me. Do it! Come on! Inside. Get in there. Fuck. Let me out! Let me out! I'm going to kill you! Let me out! I'm going to kill you! I'm going to kill you! Let me out. Let me out. Frank, please! Frank, let me out! Frank! Let me out! Let me out, Frank, please! Let me out. Help! Help! What's the fucking problem? What did I tell you, huh? For the very last time, send me men. There was trouble and I need someone! Where are they all? On vacation or what? Tell them to get their asses here immediately! What's wrong? -It's taking too long. -And now? We have to go. Okay? Fuck it. Faster, Fuad. Faster. We're nearly there. What did you do to him? What did you do? Is he dead? Did you kill him? Fuad! You used me. I'm pregnant, Frank. There's life inside of me. Is he dead? I'm in here. Help! Help! I'm in here. You're okay. You're okay. Oh, God.
