Maybe a half dozen at most. He took out Sully pretty good tonight, didn't he? Pff, Sully. A mediocre round ringer at best, and Roo barely handled him. Maybe you'd like to put your pretty boy Razor in the ring with Roo. I don't fight no round ring bullshit. Razor's going to be heavyweight champ of the world. He's going places you two only dream about. You have a goddamn bum with gloves as champ of some bullshit association or another. (Click) (Chuckle) Monkey dick. Hey, this is my goddamn club. This is where you carved on a living for 10 years! Don't you forget that! You owe me, you little piss-ant! Well, I'm glad to hear you're in the mood to talk money, Napoleon. 'Cause you're running a little short. Okay, Razor, Danny boy. Take a hike, c'mon. Go on. So what's your problem, Tenny? You're getting your cut. Yeah. Well, my cut ain't what it used to be, see. I'm taking a lot of heat letting you keep running this... one ring circus here. So, you better start coming up with some real bread. or I'm shutting you down. Fuck you. Cuff this idiot. Take him downtown. You don't know when to shut up, Napoleon. A sleazy little prick bastard like you could never shut me up. (Slap) Well, maybe not. Maybe I can't, uh? Well, but I sure as hell shut you down unless you start coming up with some serious bread. All right? I ain't giving you another penny. Not a goddamn penny more. Then you've got no more circle fights. You ain't going to stop me. I don't want to stop ya. But I'll be watching. And any fight you've got anywhere from here on in, I'm taking 50%. Huh! You got that? You don't give me nothing. I'm taking. Take this asshole out for a drive in the country and let him walk home. (Maniacal laughter) Man: You've got 400. (Indistinct chattering) (Arguing, bickering) (Continued mixed chatter) Shoot. ( ♪♪ ) ( ♪♪ ) What are you doing here, Sully? My friend Sing gave me some food, Roo. I couldn't go home empty-handed. Sorry about tonight, Roo. Napoleon promised me half the money if I beat you any way I could. He said he'd get a real kick out of seeing me, a bum, beat a guy like you. I'm sorry. Sully. Look, take this. What the hell. You need this more than I do. Take it all. Thanks, Roo. Look... just look after those kids. Don't let them grow up to be like us. Right, Sully? Right? Right, Roo. Thanks. Man: Come on, Roo. let's go! Get your old raggedy ass in the truck. (Car engine starts) ( ♪♪ ) Aw, c'mon, you guys, I made a little bread tonight, a little fortune, do you want fucking half? Come on, you guys. Give us all of it. You scumbag. C'mon, man. Relax. It's nothing, c'mon, it's nothing, it's nothing. It's not enough. It's all I've got, man, it's all I've got. You better find some more real quick. Give me a break. Come on. What's going on here, Dad? Your old man's been borrowing money again, Charlie. You know better than to be lending him money. Hey man, business is business. Come on, Nicky, clear out of here. Not tonight, Charlie. We're going to get that money, or we're going to teach that bum a lesson. If you want to hurt him, Nicky, you're going to have to hurt me first. (Engine revving) Gus always has these nice family get-togethers. Wonder why he never invites us. Maybe you should have kissed him good night, Charlie. Jealous or something, Roo? (Growling) (Whispering) I see a lion tonight. I see a lion. In the jungle. (Howling) Batty should've quit the circle years ago when he still had a brain left. (Howling continues) He ain't nothing but a muscle-bound idiot. He's all right. He still wins a few fights. Batty: (Monkey-like cries) I'm sorry about trying to throw the towel in, Roo. But you ain't as young as you used to be. Batty: (Growling, grunting) I want you to promise me something. What? That you won't fight anymore. I'm serious, Roo. I don't want you to end up like Batty. I quit the circle... I ain't got nothing else. Hell, help me run this place. I'll give you a job. I don't know nothing about running a joint like this. I'll teach you. Look, your thing's still in one piece. Batty: (Continues growling) (Banging) Promise me. I can't promise. (Laughing) Congratulations, Roo. You made it out in one piece. More or less. Ha! He should fight more, not less. Man: Sometimes less is more, Batty. (Chuckle) Gus: At least he was a safe bet. Got hair like cement. Roo, go wash that stuff off your face. Gus: (Chuckles) (Laughs) Hey! Hey, what what's this crap I hear about you retiring? Hey, you're still my best draw. C'mon, with all the bread you make fighting in my circle, you owe me at least one more shot. You made bread in every fight I did in the circle, Napper. I don't owe you nothing. I made money on you 'cause I'm smart. Don't get on your high horse with me, Roo. Yeah, you were a pretty good draw. So what? It ain't like I need you. But guys like me and you, we don't quit. And you're just like me. I ain't nothing like you. No, maybe you're not. Maybe you're just a stumbling old bum that's too dumb to know when to hit the canvas. You think about that. (Indistinct) ...cleaning toilets, washing floors. That's not enough for a man. We're warriors. Yeah! That's what we are, warriors! You and I are born in the wrong place at the wrong time. Well, there's nothing we can do about it now. Don't work for Casper. Quit! You've got to keep fighting. You want to wear a shirt and tie and sit behind a desk all day? Pushing buttons? That's what it's going to lead to. How are you supposed to be a man in this world? That is the wrong way for you and me. You've got to fight... (Indistinct) You know? (Grunting shouts) Is he crazy or something? Nah. He's a rocket scientist. ( ♪♪ ) ( ♪♪ ) Yes. Can I... help you? I've got a cheque to deliver. Well, I'll take the cheque. We're supposed to deliver it to Mr. Regan. I'm his receptionist. You can leave it with me. Well, no offence, ma'am, but this is my first day on the job and... well I work for my friend Casper, and we run a gym, and this is the rent cheque so... So I'll take the cheque. Well, you see, it's like this. Casper said to be sure and give the cheque to Mr. Regan. Right, Batty? Wrong, Roo. You don't got to do anything. All you got to do is fight. We are warriors. You must show respect. I think you'd better leave or I will call the police. You see, Roo? Now, we must fight. (Growls) What's going on here, Jane? Jane: These men are crazy. We've got a cheque for Mr. Regan. I'm Mr. Regan. (Paper rustling) Is there anything else? Well, yes, we'd like a receipt, you see. Casper said to make sure we got a receipt, so he'd know you got the cheque. The cheque is your receipt. The cheque's a cheque. I mean, how can a cheque be a receipt? What's the problem, Mr. Regan? There's no problem. Could you just please escort these "gentlemen" out, please? Hold it. Hold it. Whoa, just a minute. All we want is a receipt. You want a receipt? Excuse me... You want a receipt? (Paper crumpling) This is your receipt. Get him out of here. Ha! You dressed up collar, you... bastard! (Mixed yelling) Get your hands off me! Get them out of here! And you can just tell your boss that the next time, he has his cheque in here on the 1st of each month, not the 15th, and it'd better be certified!

Cut the crap, Napoleon. I'm the best anywhere. Ain't never been beat. That's why you want me. Hey, this is going to be good for you too, you know. Right here is where the action is. Right here's where you could be making some good bread... fighting for me. You make what you make. That's your business. You guaranteed me. You don't make the guarantee, that's my business. And I take care of my business real quick. Hey, no problem. You're the main man now, Cannon. Roo, that old fool, he just couldn't hang on no more. Just when he actually was getting hot, he folded. But don't worry. The money will be stacked up so high, you won't be able to even count it. Yes, sir. I've got Razor now. It's starting to pay off for me. It's about time with all the fucking bread I got invested in him. With you and him, I've got the world by the balls. Yeah. Who needs Roo? Not me. ( ♪♪ ) (Grunting) (Mixed shouting) ( ♪♪ ) Fuck you! You fucking maggots! (Yelling subsides) They're all bums in there. There's not one of them that's got the heart to fight Cannon. It shows, that slacking off. Yeah. Announcer: (On TV) With his recent victory, Razor Jones has cracked the top 10, but it still remains to be seen as to whether or not he has the talent to contend for the title. We'll find out next month when he meets Spider Washington, ranked number six. (Can cracking) Whatcha doing in there? I don't know, Richard. Maybe I'm just wasting my time. (Clattering) Damn. (Thud) Haaa, shii.... Are you okay, Roo? Roo: Ooh, Jee-sus. (Groaning) ( ♪♪ ) ( ♪♪ ) (Punching thumps) ( ♪♪ ) Hey, Roo. What's up? I slammed the hood on my hand. Let me look at it. Must've slammed it pretty hard. I'll live. So you're going to Razor's fight? Nah. I'm not really a big fan of Razor's. Can't blame you. I'll watch it on TV after I finish training with the kids.

But you missed a spot. (Fingers snapping) (Slap) On the house. (Flushing) Announcer: (On TV) ...this could be it. Announcer 2: I don't think... was that bad... Announcer: Well, the referee does, and that's it. It's a TKO for Razor over Mitchell in the eighth. Razor's moved in... Razor's not a fighter. He's got no heart! (Continued shouting) Batty! No! Batty! (Mixed shouting) (Crash) (Shouting continues) (Yelling) (Booing) ( ♪♪ ) One, two... ha, forget it. ( ♪♪ ) You're a bum, Cannon! Napper, you're going to have to find someone decent to fight Cannon. Ah, nobody decent wants to fight bare-fisted anymore. (Whispering) That bum. Hey, Napoleon! Hey, what are you doing in my club? Just checking out your action. What action? I remember you used to laugh at my fights. Well, you know what, Napoleon? They're betting at my fights. Yeah. You think you've got a fighter that's any good? Send him down to me. I'll make us both some money. I wouldn't send shit down to you. I'll see you later, Napoleon.

C'mon, Charlie. I'm just going down to Nap's club for a little bit. No big deal. No big deal when you win. Big deal when you don't. Give me a break, Charlie. I ain't hurting nobody. You give me a break. You can't lose the goddamn money we make fast enough. It's not like we make a whole hell of a lot. Charlie. It's just as much my money as it is yours. Yeah, it's your money, too. That's why you shouldn't be going down to Napoleon's place. You've been losing there for years. Yeah. Once in a while, I win. You win a little and you lose a lot. Now you're going to lose me. I bust my hump in here. The life I've got is shit. You know, I've been covering your ass for years. Give me a chance to get something together. Get the hell out of this miserable rat hole. While I've still got some life in me. Aw. Okay, baby. Okay. I'm sorry. I just... I'm going to take the money down there tonight, pay him off what I owe. That's it. No more. I don't want to hurt you no more. How much do we owe him? Never you mind. I'm going to go down there, pay him off. Okay? Okay. Okay. That's my girl. (Punching thumps) You okay, Charlie? (Punching continues) You've really been hitting that heavy bag a lot lately. (Punching continues) You sure must like hitting it. (Punching continues) So how's the job? (Sighs) Not so good. Why are you doing it? Casper is trying to teach me about business but... I don't learn so good. So what are you going to do? I don't know. Join the team. You've been hitting pretty good lately. I've been watching ya. Yeah? You think so? Think I can take you yet? Depends how you move in a ring. I've never been in the ring, Roo. All the time you've been coming here, punching the heavy bag and you ain't never been in the ring? How about you and I go in and... and I'll teach you some moves? Nah. I don't think so. Go on, Charlie. Go on, Charlie. I ain't going to bite. Charlie. Come on. (Softly) Come on. Okay. Now, you throw a few punches at me. Come on. (Gently) Go on. Up on your toes. Up on your toes. Now, round the circle. Come on, Charlie. That's it. Harder. Come on. That's it. That's right. Now, ain't no good throwing all the punches if you're going to get caught flat footed. Now, come on. That's it. That's it, girl. Yeah! You ain't never been in the ring? Hey! You're a natural talent. That's it, Charlie. C'mon. Faster, faster round, round. That's it, girl. ( ♪♪ ) Jab, jab, c'mon.

This starter motor looks pretty good. Yeah. How can you tell? The brushes are clean. How long you been a mechanic, Charlie? Long time. Gus used to bring me down to the garage when I was just a kid. Set that stuff down over there. We'll pick it up later. Charlie, you like being a mechanic? Yeah. Beats punching clocks. I guess it beats punching heads too. Roo? Don't pick it. I was going to give it to you. Oh, let it be. C'mon, let's go. ( ♪♪ ) Now, I've got to go to a flower shop and spend two bucks. Big spender.

So I see you're taking out Charlie these days, huh? So what? Well, that gets me wondering. I mean, I know you guys probably, you know... Does Charlie have a dick or what, man? (Giggling) With or without a dick, I'm still more man than you. Better teach your bitch to watch her mouth, man. Let's move it, man. Get out of here. (Tires squealing) Craps. Sh-h-it. Hey, Danny boy, cash me a cheque? (Crashing) Gus. Gus. Gus. We've got a little problem here, Gus. You know what that problem is? That cheque you gave me last week the one that covered that long outstanding balance you've got with us... It bounced. The cheque was no fucking good. Ah, come on, Mr. Napoleon! (Groaning) It's time to pay the piper, fella. You're a mechanic or something. Aren't you, Gus? Yeah, that's right. Fingers would be pretty important to a guy like you. Wouldn't you say? One finger, Gus. One finger every week you don't pay. (Click) Ugh... There's got to be something besides this. Napoleon: Sorry, Gus. One finger. One finger every week you don't pay, Gus. Whatever you want, I'll do it. (Sizzle of cigarette burning) ( ♪♪ ) (Retractable door whirring) Gus: Where you been? Out. Roo? I've got to talk to you. Napoleon: Your buddy Gus owes us big. But he don't have no bread to give us at the moment. So I worked out a little deal. You fight Cannon in the circle, and Gus gets to keep his fingers. The debt is cleared. Whatever makes you happy, Napoleon. What makes you happy, Roo? The crowds... cheering, calling out your name. Or maybe you miss being punched in the head. What is it, Roo? Still paying for your sins? Napoleon: What do you mean... Tenny? What's the big deal? You don't squeeze nobody else in the neighbourhood that hard. 30%, 35% that's it. Now you're giving me 50%. (Mixed shouts, grunts) What can I do here? Listen to me. You want this fight to happen? It goes down my way or not at all. (Shouting continues) All right? 50%, that's what I'm taking. Don't think about pulling any fast ones. Fighter: C'mon! That fight goes down, I'll know about it. Come on! (Grunting) (Grunting, yelling) Napoleon: Cut it out! Hey! cut it out! Hey! cut it out! (Grunting continues) Cut it out! Razor! Razor! You're supposed to tone him up, not make a fool out of him. You want someone to play with this hippopotamus, you get yourself somebody else! This guy ain't fit to tie my shoe! (Grunting) Come on! Hey, cut it out! Razor: Come on. Hey, cut it out! I'm a ranked fighter, I don't need this two-bit shit! Do you know who I am? (Rapping) I am the Razor, and that's not all When it comes to boxing yo, I know it all You can call me Ali you can call me Spinks But what really counts is what the people think They know I'm fast and they know I'm sly They know I'm number one and that's no lie! Yeah! Dammit, if I wanted a comic, I would order one! You're supposed to be a fighter not some kind of jerk-off. Napoleon: Ah, quit your bitching, Razor. I say when and I say who. And I'll damn well say how much. I don't want to hear no talk about my game plan for you. You're fucked up, you know that? Watch my lips. You don't cut it where I'm going. I've got a chance to get me some good management, slick words and smart money. Guys that can take me somewhere. I can take you someplace. I just need a little time here, for Christ's sakes. I can get you major fights, Razor. Goddamn it, it means more to me than you. It's big dollars for both of us. You hustle round ring fights, man. Did I ever ask you to fight in a circle? Not once, not once. Now you get your ass back in the gym and keep your hands working and your mouth shut! Rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb! Come on, Batty, hit me, you little wimp! Hit me! Hit me! Punch, Batty, come on, come on! Move in, move in! Move! Punch! Punch! Why the hell are you doing this? There's other ways to cover the debt, you know that. Maybe this is the way I want to do it. What's wrong with you? You ain't been training. You ain't been fighting. Don't matter. You're sliding backwards. Don't fall back in that crap. You're learning something now. What am I learning? How to clean toilets? How to fill a pump machine? For Christ's sake, Roo, give it a chance. You can't keep kicking around the circle. You want to end up like fucking Batty? He's a scrambled egg. If you give it half a chance, you can be a decent human being instead of some goddamn old punching bag for Napoleon. Hit me, Casper. (Soft punch) Hit me. (Harder punch) Hit me, Casper. Hit me!

See, you and I are through. You got what you wanted and now it's over. No more payoffs. Well, the only way it's going to be no more payments is for you to pack in your circle fights. I don't think you're about to do that. Yeah, well, I've got a new score, Tenny. Razor's starting to make real money for me. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I mean, Roo's good action. People like betting on his fights. Yeah, well, he don't want to fight no more. Didn't he have some trouble a few years back? I mean, it'd be easy for me to put some pressure on him. Throw him to Tall Tim for a few fights. Then a rematch with Cannon. We could make a killing. Hey! We could be partners. Huh. That's funny. Me, partners? With a scum-ball cop like you, that's funny.

Ra-Razor just... Razor just... Cool it... cool it, man. Cool it right down, cool it. Cool it. Razor just told me to clean out his locker, he's going to leave you, Mr. Napoleon.

Listen up, Jack, one fucking peep out of you, and my guys will have you nailed to your office door. Hey, Razor, it's me. This is me, Napper. Hey. We've been a long time together, man. Who put the clothes on your back? Who put the money in your pocket? We go back, what about that, uh? Don't! Don't run game on me, Napper. I was your main meal ticket.

He struck gold when you fought Cannon. He wants more of your action, Roo. Forget it, Napper. Hey. Tenny's holding all the cards on this one. He's talking about throwing your ass back in the loony bin. Why would he want to do that? Come on, Roo. Grow up. It's just business. Why don't you take a couple of bouts with Tall Tim for me. Maybe a rematch with Cannon. That ought to keep him happy. I don't care about Tenny. Maybe I don't want to fight no more. Hey, Roo. What's it like, living in padded cells? What's he talking about? Nothing. Female voice: (On PA) Attention, please. Visiting hours are now over. (Engine roaring) What's up, Roo? Where are we going? Fishing. My first job in this country was right here on the docks. One day I got in a scrap with the guy next to me. Beat the hell out of me. So he says to me, you're wasting your time on the docks. He took me on the road as a fighter. That guy was Napoleon. One night before a fight, I think we were in Ohio, Napoleon comes up to me and asked me to throw the fight. "You know", he said, "it'd be good for us". We'd get more money. Better fights. Did you throw it? Yeah. Badly. There was a complaint lodged and... the commission, they cancelled my licence for a year. They wouldn't let me fight anymore. What did you do? Oh, I started drinking, feeling sorry for myself. Then one night in a bar, I got in a fight with a couple of blokes and... they pulled knives on me. I guess I went a little crazy. One guy end up in the hospital and... other guy end up in the morgue. What happened to you? The court said I was criminally insane. I guess I might have been at the time. But after eight years of padded cells and fucking shock therapy, if I wasn't crazy when I went in I sure as hell was when I came out. What you do when you got out? Not much. Bummed around. Nothing seemed to work for me and... then I met up with Napoleon again. He offered me a job. Fighting in the circle. So how does Tenny figure in? Tenny takes a piece of Napoleon's action. Tenny says if I don't do it, he's going to have the state throw my ass straight back into the loony bin. He could do that? I don't know. But I sure as hell don't want to bet against him. (Boat horn blasts) You're going to need a corner man. Corner person. (Chuckles) Yep. You're really going to like these guys, Roo. They're just like you. Big, strong, and no fucking brains. (Laughs) You know what they say, eh, Roo? No brain, no pain. Yo, where's... (Indistinct) Is this your fighter? Where's your goddamn circle, man? (Flames whoosh) Whoo-oo, hot stuff. (Flames crackling, mixed shouting) (Punching thuds) (Indistinct yelling) ( ♪♪ ) ( ♪♪ ) (Screaming) ( ♪♪ ) ( ♪♪ ) (Bell rings, sirens wails) (Honking) You lucky, Roo! Got to fight all the Spartans. Best thing ever happened to you. I don't think so, Batty. Listen, I'm getting too old for this shit. Better than getting thrown out from that smart lawyer's office. Or cleaning somebody's locker. You've got to challenge now, Roo. Yeah. Yeah, I've got a challenge. (Panting) Man can't be a man without a challenge. Batty. There are better ways to prove you're a man than by bashing someone's head open. Sounds like you've been talking to the girl too much, Roo. That's no warrior's talk. Batty. We are not warriors. I mean, we're just two old fight bums. We're too stupid to make a living any other way. I mean, all that shit we talk about warriors, that was to make us feel better. I mean, take a look at us. We're both... just old fight bums. Don't listen to that, Roo. We are warriors. We were born in the wrong place at the wrong time. That's all. Yeah. Okay, Batty. We're both warriors. Man: All right. Big fight, make room, guys, let's go. (Mixed shouting) Doc, let's go! Hey, Pete, how's your lady, man? Hey! Where's... (Mixed shouting continues) Roo. I want you to meet Patch, the sea creature. (Groaning) He's got a bit of a handicap, only one hand. So this is going to kind of like... even the odds. Wouldn't you say? Patch: (Laughing) I'm going to stick this stump right up your ass. Okay! Down in the boat, let's go! (Mixed shouting) (Groaning and grunting) ( ♪♪ ) (Strangled grunting) (Groaning) ( ♪♪ ) (Splashing) ( ♪♪ ) I want my money! ( ♪♪ ) Hey, Nap. You like the cameras? Am I taking care of you? Well, look who just slid in under the door. I've making pretty good bread of those funky fighters that's Tall Tim lined up for Roo. Thanks to you. Thanks to me? Yeah, without you screwing up in the first place, none of that good bread would've had a chance of cropping up. Let me buy you a shave. You're a real piece of shit. The last thing Roo needs is you. You know, the funny thing is I actually like Roo, crazy bastard that he is. Why shouldn't you like him? The bread you're making off him. You find some balls or something all of a sudden, Gus? You fucking sleaze. Hey! I may be a sleaze, but at least I don't pretend to be something else. Not like that, Detective cop bastard, Tenny. Coming on like he's a decent citizen and putting the squeeze on me and everybody else in the neighbourhood for half the action. Oh, yeah. You know something else, too, Gus? You want to know who got Roo fighting again? Whose idea it was? It was Tenny. So you want to hate somebody, hate him. You didn't have to go along with him. No? Well I had a cash flow problem! Or have you forgotten already? But stick around. This next fight is going to be a real treat for Roo. What kind of treat? You'll see soon enough. See you later, Gussy boy. (Mixed shouting) ( ♪♪ ) Excuse me, okay. Got a real nice surprise for you tonight. Look up there. (Sustained shout) (Mixed chatter) No way. I can't fight you, Batty. You're my friend, Roo. My only friend! I know, that's why I can't fight you. No, Roo. That's why you must fight me. This is my last fight. Tonight I'll be free. Show me the... (Indistinct) Show me you love me! Hey, Roo, man! The guy loves ya! What you gonna do, fight him... or fuck him? (Screaming) Crazy bastard. (Grunting) (Clinking) (Whirring) (Grunting) (Whirring) ( ♪♪ ) (Groaning) ( ♪♪ ) ( ♪♪ ) I'm sorry, Batty. Can't do it, buddy. Time to go. ( ♪♪ ) Batty: (Screaming) (Crashing) (Brakes squeal, gear shift clicks) Roo. Batty's dead. This ain't going to help him. Wait here. (Footsteps receding) You should have seen the fucking guy. He jumped off the top of the building. (Cackling) What about the heat? No heat. No one anywhere? Nah, he took off. Jesus Christ, man. That's insane. He just fucking... Roo: You! You owe me. I owe you nothing, Roo. They should've fined the wacko for littering the streets. (Chuckling) Sunny side up on the sidewalk, hey, Roo? He bounced. (Chuckling) Bounce. (Roaring) (Objects and furniture clattering) Roo: (Roaring, grunting) Charlie: Stop it. (Thud) Roo! ( ♪♪ ) ( ♪♪ ) ( ♪♪ ) ( ♪♪ ) ( ♪♪ ) ( ♪♪ ) ( ♪♪ ) ( ♪♪ ) ( ♪♪ ) (Dog barking in the distance) Go away, Charlie. You want to die? Don't let me stop you 'cause I know why you're up here. You've taken so much shit, you just can't stand it anymore. No... No. That's not it, Charlie. No one's to blame. It's me. I don't deserve to live. I hurt people, Charlie. Casper... Batty. I killed Batty, Charlie. No, Roo. It's true. I'm crazy. (Siren wailing in the distance) They were right. I'm the geek. You know, the gig in the sideshow, what chews off chickens' heads? Yeah, I'm the crazy bastard in the cage. You're out of the cage. Yeah, I'm out of the cage. I got beat right out. Everything that ever meant anything to me is gone. Except you, Charlie. And I don't want to be around to hurt you. Then fight him again. What? You've got to walk away, but on your own terms. Fight him again. Beat him. Beat all those leeches at their own game. Then walk. We'll start a new life together. You and I. You ain't crazy, Roo. We can do it. ( ♪♪ ) ( ♪♪ ) You want him? Roo: Yeah, I want him. You've got him. You're just like me, Roo. You walk away from this and you just another square fucking nobody. But here, we are both kings. You've got a whole lot of that for everything you can squeeze out of it. 'Cause that's all you've got. Listen. Cut the crap. I've got my own reasons for taking this fight, Napper. No, you listen. Nobody screws me over. If it wasn't for me, you'd still be weaving baskets in the wacko farm. I got you started again. But you went and fucked up with Casper. You should have been fighting for me, Roo. All these years, you should have been fighting for me. Well, I want them all back. Every single fucking game. ( ♪♪ ) ( ♪♪ ) ( ♪♪ ) (Inaudible) ( ♪♪ ) ( ♪♪ ) ( ♪♪ ) Casper: I hear you and Charlie are living together. She taking good care of you? Yeah. You taking good care of her? I'm trying. Good. Casper. I've got something I've got to tell you. No. You don't gotta tell me nothing. Yeah. I've got to tell you. What are you going to tell me? That you've been fighting again? That you've been letting Napoleon pimp you? That you're going to get it on with Cannon again? (Coughing) Well, go on, tell me. Go on, Roo. Get out of here. Go on. Do what you've got to do. (Sighs) (Distant shouting) Napoleon: Hey, Razor, glad you and your friends could make it down. Drinks on the house for everybody. Hey, listen, kid. You and I might've had our differences, but all that's water under the bridge. Hey, you've got a good ranking now. I can see you're going all the way. About this new management; I don't blame you. Hey, business is business. Straight up. Congratulations, kid. (Slaps) Have a good time. ( ♪♪ ) Tenny: There's nothing here! So where the hell is it? We'll find it, okay? We'll find it. You're goddamn right we'll find it.

(Coughing) (Shouting continues) (Water drips) (Clatter in bucket) Hey, what the hell's going on here? Mr. Napoleon says you ain't going in tonight. Like hell I'm not. Not tonight. (Mixed shouting) Referee: Let's go. ( ♪♪ ) Referee: (Indistinct) ( ♪♪ ) (Growling) (Screaming) (Thuds) (Repeated thuds) ( ♪♪ ) One, two, three...

(Shouting amplifies) (Chain-link rattling) Crowd: (Chanting) Roo! Roo! Roo! Roo! Roo! (Booing) So that's what makes you happy, eh Roo? Makes you feel little less crazy, don't it? Beating a man half to death. I ain't crazy, Napper. Napoleon: You think this proves you're something other than what you are? A pathetic washed up, never-was-anything old bum? Yeah, I know, Roo. You didn't make it 'cause you never had a chance. The same bullshit smokescreen that every other dumb fuck failure out there uses. No, Roo. You're nothing 'cause you're nothing. I beat everyone you threw at me, Napper. They were all bums. Then give me someone! I'll take on anyone! I'll fight him right now! Razor! Get in here, and show this bum what it takes to be a real boxer. I never fought this uh... circle crap. And I ain't about to start now. Napoleon: Look at this beat-up old man. He's barely standing. Get in here, give him some boxing lessons. Man in crowd: Yeah, go for it, Razor! Woman in crowd: Yeah, come on! Man in crowd: Come on, go for it. Napoleon: What's the matter, Razor? You're chicken to fight... ...without the gloves on? Nobody shakes me, man! Roo does, you bastard. Napoleon's right. Where's your balls? What's wrong with you, man! You got a death wish? I'll kill you! (Angry screaming) What the hell, man? Show these fucks who you are! Fight the dude! You can finish in a minute! Get this shit over with and let's go party! You want it? Crowd: Yeah! (Louder) You want it? Crowd: Yeah! You've got it! Keep the threads fresh, baby, I'll be right back! Somebody bring me a pair of boxing boots! (Mixed chatter) ( ♪♪ ) ( ♪♪ ) ( ♪♪ ) That's it, boss. We've got it all. (Glass shattering) Tenny! (Chuckles) Where's my fucking end, Napoleon? (Chuckles) Maxxy's got your end. Come and get it, sucker! (Laughing) You son of a bitch. No ref, no rounds. (Cheering) Last man standing wins. (Bell rings) You're a nightmare, Roo. Look at you. You're a middle aged old man and you're still fighting this circle crap. And what have you got to show for it? I'm never going to be like you, Roo! Come on, Roo. Come on. Come on. I'm going to punch you for being such a fool. (Thuds, grunting) You like that? You want some more? (Punching thuds, grunting) You like that, Roo, uh? You want some more? Come on, I could dance all night. (Grunting) We'll see. (Grunting) (Shouting) (Crowd clamouring) Come on, Roo, getting tired? Come on, Roo, can you move your feet? Come on, Roo, come on, let's go, Roo. (Cheering) Various: Come on, Roo! Come on, Roo! (Mixed shouting) (Yell) (Yelling) Get him! Razor's a goddamn bleeder. What, he's never been cut before? He's hardly been hit before. Half his damn fights I fix myself. What's the matter? These new people don't take care of the fights? Ah, who gives a shit. He don't fight for me no more. He's fighting for you now. (Chuckles) ( ♪♪ ) ( ♪♪ ) Get him! Get him! Get him! Get him! ( ♪♪ ) ( ♪♪ ) Crowd: Roo! Roo! Roo! Roo! Roo! Yo!
