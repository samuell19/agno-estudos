THE PEOPLE GO WHERE THE POWERS THAT BE LEAD THEM - CHARLES PEGUY Welcome to Radio France News. This is Mr. Paul Reynaud Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense and War. I am here to announce a serious event to the French people. We knew that dark days would come. And they have come. France has been invaded hundreds of times but never defeated. Each time, the strength of our soldiers of every French woman and man increase tenfold. Misfortune has always made our country stronger. We've never been more united than we are today. FRANCE, BEGINNING OF JUNE 1940 On the new frontline, our great leader Weygand in accordance with Marshal Pétain on the Somme and the Aisne, and we will hold out. And because we shall hold out, we shall be victorious. Boys, an officer is coming. Give me your arm. Get him a chair. Do you think the Krauts will come? They're on our tail. They don't march, they run. I thought we were sending the Huns home with a boot up their asses. They'll set up camp. Here, Lieutenant. Thank you. - Where do you live? - Vichy, Lieutenant. Vichy. Is it nice there? It's nicer in summer. But it's home to me. Don't complain. At least in your hometown we'll be safe. My sows have been needing to be bled for three weeks. But the abattoir has been closed since the start of the attack. The slaughterers are all at the front. Your pigs will be happy about that. I'm leaving them in your care, Mr. Mayor. I don't know how long I'll be gone for. I'll take care of them like I would my own sons. - France first. - Yes. I'm going to fight for the armistice. The Krauts! What the hell…? Come on. - Make way. - Up you get. - Don't push! - They'll be here soon. - What? - The Krauts are almost here. Move! Mom! What turns my stomach is the thought of our youth dying like animals. Give me my drops, please. Five. We have to stop this massacre. Ten. We can't relive the slaughter of 1914. - Have you seen my Mom? - No. - Have you seen my mother? - No. Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? Marshal, Sir. Marshal. Come on. Come on. Marshal, take shelter. It could start again at any moment. Paul, you're getting on my nerves. Hélène, we can't waste any more time. Let me get on with it. A strategic retreat doesn't mean we can't choose a restaurant. Hello. Are you serving lunch? I haven't got much left. - Half of it's gone. - For Mr. Paul Reynaud, Prime Minister? Next to the window. It's good to be in France. Ask for an armistice, Paul. Listen to the Marshal. - You're always talking about him. - But he's a great man. A great man who taught me what pleasure is. Ah. Wonderful. Thank you. I would sit on his knee when I was three years old. My dear friend, you have certainly remained a child. But this is not child's play. This is the French government. What's childish is a government that leaves without knowing where to go. The Germans have crossed the Seine. This time, it's stupid to say we'll fight until only the last man's left standing. It would be criminal. Marshal? Your soup is ready. I lost my father at Verdun. You must have known him. Tall, red hair. Be quiet, Mélanie! You're bothering the Marshal. I have two sons, Marshal. Michel, on the Maginot Line. And Baptiste, Sergeant of the 27th Regiment. Will you do something for them? Tired, but above all, furious. They've decided to throw the government out on the streets. This puppet government. - I can't even reach them. - But you're part of the government? Yes. They want to send me to château de Nitray. - They're taking me as their mascot. - Where? Nitray. Look it up on the map. It's over. The English are abandoning us. But what about you? How are you? Little Ménétrel has just arrived. I have to go. Goodbye. Great, you've come right in the middle of all this mess. Take off your hat. Marshal, Sir. Marshall, Sir, I've been speaking to our French citizens on the road. - They're comparing you to Joan of Arc. - Joan of Arc was 19. And you have the heart of an adolescent in the body of a patriarch. Joan of Arc was miraculously young and you're miraculously old. You like extremes because that's what strikes people most. - You think? - That's why we brought you here. Don't let them take your glory then scurry away like rabbits. How? How did it come to this in France? Because of the Jews, Marshal. Everything was going well up until the Popular Front. But the Republic is not a metaphor. People only think of leisure now. They shun the idea of effort. What a waste. What a mess and a waste! Say… What do you think of Laval? Laval is one of the ones that got us in the most trouble with his second-rate democracy. He's all at sea. Even the MPs have kicked him out. That's precisely it, my good man, isn't it? An ex Prime Minister who ends up as an MP in the countryside will be vengeful. Boudot! If we have to get through the whole war in reverse it might be time to change the old jalopy. Yes, Sir. I'm joking. But it's a shame it's come to this. All this for Danzig. What the hell were we doing in that war? Now we have to avoid the worst. Use our trump card. - What trump card? - Our only one, Boudot. Pétain. The Marshal? He's more than 90 years old. 84, Boudot. In his prime. The one man the French will follow. Besides, he's all we have. The Marshal. Lets say he takes power. What then? What then? He's just an ornament. I'll put him on the mantelpiece and dust him from time to time. He loves that. The most important thing is to stop fighting. Arms never achieve anything good. Ever. Thy don't want women in government. THE CHATEAU OF CANGÉ They refuse us the right to vote. And look where it gets us! It's a real mess. Do something about it, my friend! Hello, Mandel. My dear friend. Get in the back, I think there's still a spot. - What's all this? - The government has arrived from Paris. It's like the circus has arrived. My dear Weygand. We should have stayed in Paris. There was less traffic. What the hell's going on? - Mr. President. - Oh, my dear friend. - Dashing as ever. - And yet the situation is rather… - The meeting will take place in… - Good day. Rumors of course. According to Weygand, the communists have taken the Élysée. They're undermining morale. It's you stirring things up. Peace must come one way or another. So decide. So while the soldiers are fighting, the government has decided to flee. The question is: how do we continue to fight? It would be good if a few ministers got killed. - We must resist, whatever the cost. - Impossible! - With what resources? - Are you refusing - to obey government orders? - Listen. I am a man. A free man. When my conscience tells me not to do something, I cannot do it. Do you grant a soldier the right to disobey when his conscience dictates? No, of course not. Then your idea of obedience strikes me as curious, to say the least. The Germans have 140 divisions. I barely have 50. Columns of armed vehicles are breaking through and sowing panic. There are millions of refugees on the roads. I can't move a single regiment without crushing civilians! 50 divisions is a lot… You can't look at it like that. It's still an army, Minister. But it's an army on its knees. Which is why I think the French government shouldn't waste another moment before asking the Germans - for an armistice. - Out of the question! Don't forget France is not alone. There's the English. The English will fold. The Germans will get through. We're done! We have the colonies… North Africa. - The Empire. - Bastards! You don't understand anything. I'm out of here. I believe the Marshal has something to announce. I do not believe we should abandon France and accept the suffering that will be imposed upon the Fatherland and its subjects. The French renaissance will be the fruit of this suffering. And the French revival will arrive if we stay put. I hereby declare, that even if I have to leave the government, I refuse to leave French soil. I shall remain with the French people to share their sorrows and misery. Armistice, in my view is the necessary condition for the survival of France. This proposal is an affront to France's honor. The Germans are at the door. Is this the time to play American songs? A bit of bravery wouldn't hurt. - A waltz! A waltz! - Viennese? Can't we play a beguine? Or the rumba? Ramona Ramona, I had a wonderful dream We went away together Slowly we left behind All the jealous glances Never have two lovers known a sweeter night Ramona, I was intoxicated - Hey! Where are you going? - I work here. Bergaugnon! François! Colette! François is coming! François! François! Here, take this. Careful, it's heavy. Two more cannons to unload from the Ministry, boys. - Be careful! - Don't worry, my boy. We need compresses! Hurry! We'll take care of you. - Where should we put him? - Put him there, please. - There? - Yes, there. Watch out. RIGAL WINE MERCHANTS OF BORDEAUX - Good day, Marshal. - You look ravishing. I don't feel it. One day with fat old President Reynaud and I feel like I've been dragged across France on a mule. I hope the Germans won't decide to bomb Bordeaux. All this moving is exhausting. - Ah, Baudouin. How are you? - Good day, Mr. Laval. I'm well. The Americans won't budge. If they do, it'll be in three years as usual. By then… The Marshal listens to you. Make him understand that his presence in this government is cheating the French. The Marshall only wants to serve his country. Then he should distance himself from Reynaud. Or better still… Replace him. You heard me. The moment he feels he's alone, Reynaud gets the itch to resign. He needs to meet the Marshal. What he needs is a man of experience. Who can help him make decisions himself. What's going on? Quick! We must pray. Marshal Pétain has replaced Paul Reynaud as head of the government. He has been appointed by President Albert Lebrun to form a government. We will now resume our musical programming. Don't look so glum. At least the Germans are decent. I can't stand the sight of them. No, no, no! One subject, one verb, one complement. That's the best of the lot. No. You have to say… "Admirable." "Admirable army", etc. You just said no adjectives. And when I say no adjectives, it's to better emphasize those which are indispensable. Here, you should write: "the unfortunate refugees." There. "Unfortunate." Are you listening? Don't you know I'm part of the Académie française? There. That's better. But you need to find a way of formulating this. Something better than: "I place myself at the service of France." Something more like… like an offering. "I am offering myself to France "to alleviate her misfortune. "In these painful hours, I think of those unfortunate refugees who, in this unprecedented situation are roaming the roads. I express my compassion and my concern. It is with a heavy heart that I am telling you today that we must cease fighting. You see, darling? If you had listened to me… You'd still be the head of the government. Marshal, I tried to reach you when I received your call. I wanted to offer you my congratulations and best wishes for the government you will be leading. Mr. Laval, I asked you to come because there are a few small issues. Small issues that are causing major hold ups. Small issues? It's total anarchy, Marshal. These MPs who want to go off to Algiers. - May I? - You're right. We must prevent them from leaving at all costs. Who's in charge here? Them, or me? Let them go, Marshal. We can make do without them. As I was saying, there are some issues but you're going to help me sort them out. Given the urgency, I took a piece of paper from my pocket just now and read this list to Lebrun. Chautemps… Vice President. With him we have Darlan, Maritime Affairs. Weygand, Defense of course. - What's your opinion? - Excellent. - What's the problem? - I'm getting to it. It's you. When it comes to you, the President has gotten up on his high horse. "Laval? Not a chance." "Laval, Minister of Foreign Affairs?" Do we want to rub the English up the wrong way? Now I know that it's always about the English. But right now it's not in our interests to fall out with them. When they learn about the armistice, they'll say we've cheated them. As for the Americans… Anyway. I am asking you to resign as Minister for Foreign Affairs and take over Justice. For the time being. Afterwards, things will settle down. Who's your Minister for Foreign Affairs? - Baudouin. - Baudouin? Listen. I've nothing against him. But if that's the case, it was no use changing government. If this is your decision… If you refuse to give me a post aligned with my skills, and employ me in my natural function of defending French interests against England and Germany, let me tell you plainly. I refuse to take part in this government. Beware, Marshal. Politics is a dirty business. War is nothing in comparison. Marshal, I'm pleased that you are able to see reason. Marshal, what's the latest? Laval is telling everyone he's Minister for Foreign Affairs. - Is there a problem with that? - Marshal… We already spoke about this. The English… - And Roosevelt! - Listen, gentlemen. My interests lie with France, not with England. Marshal, it's precisely France that we don't want to divide. Our citizens don't like Laval either. Baudouin, on the other hand, is liked by all. As a military man, you have failed to assimilate certain civil considerations. And believe me, I am not speaking in my own interests. In other words, Mr. Baudouin, war is one profession - and politics is another entirely. - Precisely. Mr. President, I believe I understand. And seeing as to understand is to obey… Mr. Baudouin, you will take on the role of Minister of Foreign Affairs. As for Laval, I'll find him a post suited to his level of popularity. Mr. President. I am touched by your approach. And I need your advice. I may be old enough to be your dad but I will always regard you as a dear mentor. Gentlemen. …advance takes no stopping… This time it's really out. I told you. The only broadcasts we get come from Vichy. Can't a smart little French girl like you do something? I can ask my fiancé. Sorry, could you go and see something? Sir. …only another 37 to Paris… The fate of the world is upon us. - That's not the BBC. - It is. Look. I, General de Gaulle, speaking from London, - invite every officer… - If you don't like it, I'll change it. …on British soil with their arms Where are their arms? to report directly to me. No matter what The flame of French resistance… You French love your speeches! …tomorrow, like today, - I will address you from London. - Who is this de Gaulle? - Did you hear the General's speech? - The Marshal? - Yes, everyone did. - And? What did you think? It was good. - So you agree with him? - Yes, he's the voice of France. - Should we obey? - Of course. …General Keitel is about accept the armistice from the French government… We're in front of the Compiègne Wagon, where the Germans signed the armistice of 1918. The conditions are very harsh. Every one goes directly against honor. The army is to be demobilized, except for 100,000 men to maintain order. What about the fleet? My interlocutors have not asked for its delivery. - No word. - It must be disarmed. The national territory is only to be partially occupied beyond a line that would leave them the Atlantic coast and essentially, the area north of the Loire. They would like the government to settle in the free zone. What about Paris? Paris is occupied. And the colonies? There is no mention of the colonies in the Germans' demands. - What about the prisoners? - No agreement on prisoners. There are around two million. We are in charge of occupation troops. They also want us to hand over the German refugees. - Hand over the German refugees? - Absolutely not! Hand over refugees? That would be an abomination. - To the happy couple! - To the happy couple! Yes! The happy couple. Yes! The Marshal! The Marshal is here! The Marshal is here! Long live the Marshal! - Long live the Marshal! - Long live the Marshal! Children. Happy citizens in this new France. I wish you all the happiness. Marshal, we should go. It would be safer. Long live the Marshal! He's worried about Vichy. He fears the government will be cramped. There are plenty of hotels. It has Europe's most modern telephone exchange. We'll find everything we need there. I sent patients there every year. The Vichy regime is doing well. They're 20 minutes from my home. I can guarantee they're in good spirits. - Mr. President. - Vichy is a terrible idea! People will say we're a casino government. Marshal. Marshal, the hotel manager would like to show you the rooms. After you. See? It's the Marshal. The hotel has been requisitioned, Sir. Please vacate immediately. The rooms are a little small, Marshal. My apologies. But we won't be here long. Two months maximum. Here. Then the government can go back to Paris. Or… Or Versailles, as you wish. Oh! The Minister for Maritime Affairs wants hot chocolate with no sugar. We're run off our feet! Not to mention all his lady friends! Don't complain, it's better to have too much work than none at all. Some people are taking advantage. The brasserie has doubled its prices. The Marshal being here is quite something. Well. He may be an important man but we'll still have to empty his chamber pot! MAP OF VICHY Gentlemen, let's continue our planning. Justice in Plaisance, Maritime Affairs at the Hotel Célestins. We'll be the talk of the town. Second floor, Laval. Foreign Intelligence. Third floor, the ministers' quarters. Marshal, it's time for your shot. The Doctor can barely take temperatures but he's a dear friend who gives sage advice. I advised Mr. Reynaud to send de Gaulle to England. To get rid of him. Marshal, may I speak with you for one moment? - Yes? - Marshal… It's about my room. The basin is minuscule. Don't you think? - Honestly! - Oh no… It hasn't changed! Mr. Laval, I've been meeting with a lot of people lately. Mainly company owners. They have all said there's one thing responsible for the whole debacle. The Popular Front. We know this, of course. Do we know this? Certainly, Marshal. The problem is this world of leisure. Low birth rates. And prioritizing personal interest over the nation's interests. In short: work. - family, the Fatherland. - Precisely. Don't think me a reactionary. Quite the opposite. I believe we need a real revolution. - but a revolution… - A national revolution. Mr. Laval. Are you familiar with this book? How to Raise a State by General Salazar. It was published by Flammarion. Read it. I like Salazar a lot. A model worthy of a Christian people. France's renewal cannot accommodate a representative democracy. I've been thinking about this, Marshal. If parliament is to dissolve, it's better it happens naturally. Do you think they'll willingly give up their positions? - Why not ask them? - Mr. Laval… I have no experience talking to these… these gentlemen. I have no desire, to tell you the truth. I will take care of it, Marshal. One can work on politicians. And I'm rather good at it. I'll change their minds. If I have your permission, of course. It's funny, I was going to say "walk on" politicians. - How are you? - Good day, Laval. The dissolution of parliament… - Do you ever think about it? - I do. My dear friend. What would you do with national representation? Like sleeping beauty, we'd put it to sleep. Besides, it needs a good rest. Representation is tiresome. It clouds the complexion. But rest assured, parliament will keep its prerogatives. And of course, you will continue to receive your allowances. It won't be easy. Chickens don't like to pluck themselves. Those who resist, I'll deal with one by one. In politics, people always have something to sell. The key is to buy when the time's right. My dear friend, have you already tasted the prunes? - Yes. - They're delicious. But the thing I miss is… the label. Saint-Maximin prunes. - Any chance you could…? - Consider it done. There. Another vote for giving the Marshal full powers. What's so amusing? Esau spurned his birthright for a plate of lentils. I'm buying the Republic with prunes. Make no mistake, Laval. You need me. Just like you need me. Your one-party policy won't work. Fascism is a joke. Like most "isms". Good day. You know my newspaper is highly influential. Yes, I know. So help me, and I will find you a key position. Higher up than Doriot, Luchaire… And all your little friends in the Franco-German crab basket. "In Paris, German soldiers with a flair for music have taken to boosting the population's morale by playing the Germanic repertoire in all the main pavilions. Let's do the same, it'll be appreciated. Out of the question! Are we musicians or rotating sirens? First we had to do American numbers. Now you want German music? That's enough, children! Pleasing the public is our honor. Music is my joy, my sorrow, and my one true master. Lebrun, Pétain, Chamberlain and Hitler will pass. But music will always remain. Music is more powerful than war! Germany to me is the waltzes of Strauss. And to that I say, Vive l'Allemagne! - You don't believe that. - Yes, I do. And I know I'm right. Strauss is Austrian. Do you know any German music? Yes. Everybody does. Down with the Jews! Out with the Bolsheviks! Down with the Jews! Out with the Bolsheviks! Down with the Jews! Out with the Bolsheviks! Down with the Jews! Out with the Bolsheviks! VICHY GRAND CASINO, JULY 10TH, 1940 Laval! Laval! Long live Laval! Gentlemen. What a group. Radicals. Excellent. The orchestra… Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Journalists? Please go to the balcony. Press to the balcony! To the balcony! Come along! There's Reynaud. He's looking better. - After his accident. - Prime Minister. Please. Comrade Blum. Michel Grenier. - Grenier! Deputy mayor of Saint-Nazaire. - Yeah. What did the group decide upon? The group decided not to make a decision. We've been elected to the Popular Front and we're about to crown Pétain king? Laval's proposal is preposterous. Pétain will have more power than Louis XIV. To think that Blum told us before the war that Pétain was the only republican marshal. Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Down with traitors! War on England! War on England! Those are Doriot's boys. What is he making them do? Léon, one of us has to speak. What are you doing? - I vote against. - Save France but not destroy the Marshal. My work is done. It's a foregone conclusion. Predictions? Pétain, winner by default. - Who are they? - Foreign ambassadors. Including yours. You'll see. This is unprecedented. The republic performing harakiri on itself. Good day, Mr. President. What's the latest? A jealous man like you should know. These are the lambs. There were a few lions but they decided to leave. We didn't stop them. Gentlemen, colleagues. The floor is open. Without further ado, let's hear from Mr. Laval, Vice President. We have been defeated. There has been no greater disaster in our history. We have not overlooked any mistakes. We have all committed them. We have done everything to bring about war, and everything to lose it. The greatest crime was to declare war without preparing. England dragged us into it. And did nothing to enable us to emerge victorious. This is a cold reception. They look afraid. Under the new motto of "work, family, and fatherland" we move towards the new order. This is disgusting. We are left no choice but to collaborate loyally with Germany and Italy. I wanted this collaboration during peace time. I sadly regret that it is happening after our defeat. We have an opportunity, joy in the sadness that has befallen us to have one victorious soldier in France. The Marshal of France! We have… We have the good fortune of being able to stand behind him to ensure the country's salvation. Long live the republic, anyway! This is unacceptable! - Do you realize what's happening? - Outrageous. Gentlemen! Look at the spectacle we are offering to other countries! To the international press! We are in an absolute state of emergency! And the Germans are 30 miles away! I took them to the cleaners. 569 for, 80 against. 17 abstentions. Not a single amendment. Even Herriot was praising you. So there's work to do but no opposition in principle. - What about Reynaud? - Alone on his bench in his dunce cap. Blum didn't open his trap. They were good as gold. Come to the balcony, Marshal. For a standing ovation. No my friend, I'll leave that to the others. Go get some rest, soldier. You deserve it. Marshal. Modesty hasn't held me back up to now, has it? And… - Did you see what Laval wanted to do? - Yes. He wanted to take the credit behind me. Not likely. Long live Pétain! Marshal! Here we are! You have given us back our hope The fatherland shall be reborn Marshal, here we are! Marshal, here we are! Before you, savior of France For driving God from our schools, from the nation's courts, for promoting unhealthy literature, white slavery, and for the promiscuity of our workshops, offices, factories. Lord, we ask forgiveness. For accepting a secular France, Lord, we ask forgiveness. What use was the victory of 1918? What use would an easy victory have been in 1940? This defeat was God's will. He sent the Marshal to restore France. His Excellence, the Ambassador of Germany. His Excellence, the Ambassador of the United States and his wife. The Americans would do better to send in troops. They don't care. They're across the Atlantic. The crème de la crème of French literature are among us. Mr. Charles Maurras, of course. René Benjamin, Jacques Chardonne, Henri Pourrat, Marcel Jouhandeau. Henry Bordeaux. Editor Bernard Grasset. And a man who needs no introduction, Mr. Jean Giraudoux. Should I say writer? Playwright? Minister? I looked out upon Limagne, that embraces my dear Limousin, Puy de Dôme, overlooking it all. Like a cap on a handsome rogue. The depth of France, its insolence, - the purest of races. - Coming through. Move it! Get out the way. - I'm looking for Antonio. - He's here. Antonio! Someone wants to see you. It's about a ministry role. - Is number seven ready? - It's coming! - Antonio? I'm here on behalf of… - I know. Come. - Come along, you might be useful. - I'll be right back. I'm looking for Comrade Tanjiel. - He's in Clermont prison. - What about the others? Some friends have been arrested. There are prisoners of war and those who are against the German-Soviet pact. Then there's the minority, the cowards. - What about you? - Oh. Did Maurice go to Moscow? The Representative of the Soviet Union, and his wife! Even the Russians… Now that's diplomacy. - You have to resume contact in Vichy… - We have no weapons. - Weapons? What for? - To get them out. No. You're crazy. No fighting. The line is clear. The defeat is because the French middle classes didn't ally with the USSR. The Pétain government was only possible because the party was outlawed. With the help of social democracy. We have to remobilize workers. Demand legal publication of l'Humanité. Legal publication? Fraternize with German soldiers. His Excellency the apostolic representative. There are more uniforms parading around here than there were on the front line, and we had to fight. OK, but what about de Gaulle? de Gaulle, Pétain it's the same thing, as you said. I've cured you. It's been a long time. One time, in Spain. Going to England in an airplane is one step further. Imagine. The Polish government is in exile. The Belgian government is in London. The King of Denmark is a prisoner. We have to join de Gaulle. Think about it, if you get the itch. It's something… de Gaulle, sentenced to death for resistance… It makes you think. Is that all they're saying where you are? The problem is that people I meet here are for Pétain and de Gaulle. It's hard to form an opinion. Think about it. You don't become a patriot by obeying. There you go! Good day, Mr. le Curé. Thank you. The number one priority is the family policy. The drop in birth rate is what caused us to naturalize. France could have been defended by foreigners. More reason to strengthen the anti-Israeli agenda. Gents, that's fine, but it is urgent that we meet Hitler's representative in France. A Vice President should not just be meeting with Mr. Abetz. Forget etiquette, Baudouin. Abetz will save us the trouble. If necessary I'd wait for him all night in the creek. You had better sign the laws that are submitted to you. To purify France. Mr. Laval, you claim to act efficiently but I can see it is you who is disrupting the agenda. The agenda of fighting the influence of the Jews. Allow me to read the project preamble, Marshal. Everywhere, and in particular in the public services, the influence of the Jews can be felt. - Insidious and pernicious. - No, "insidious and pernicious" is weak. To highlight their harmful influence I would say "insidious and ultimately, destructive." Because they have destroyed the country. I don't want the Jews in the justice or teaching systems. That would be difficult. We would need replacements. We can't train teachers overnight. We'll allow some exceptions in the regulations. In particular for veterans. French Jews of honor. But no Jews from the elite. I don't want Jews in the Court of Appeal. I'd also like to relax some agricultural regulations. No, Mr. Laval. And make sure you highlight the Marshal's moral qualities. Never smoke near him. I asked him outright. Why does Laval insist on smoking in front of the Marshal? You know what he dared to reply? "Laval smokes like the Marshal breathes." I wanted to know why the second floor was infested with politicians. Which implies Israelis, Freemasons and the like. The reply? "President Laval counts among them almost all of his friends." We're dealing with this. Xavier Vallat sent me a report on the infiltration of Jews in France. He hasn't worked on anything else for the last ten years. "Of the 100,000 Jews who call themselves citizens, there is the addition of the 12 sub-classes of Jews from the East." Hence the importance of giving them a status. Is this what the Germans want? The Germans? My poor Gillouin. They will not dictate our policies. I don't understand, Gillouin. You agree with me, don't you? So why do you always take the Jews' side? Marshal? Marshal, look. - I have it. The first Francisque. - Excellent. Let's see. What excellent work. Noble French artisans. Marshal. We have to assign prefects. I'd like to introduce René Bousquet, who will represent you in the Marne. We are working, Mr. President, on the preparation of an anti-freemason law. Which bothers you. Admit it. Marshal, it certainly won't pay the occupation indemnity. Mr. Laval, I have two things for your government. Firstly, the Francisque. A decoration we reserve for our good servants. Come here. I hereby give it to you. Secondly, I am head of state. And I know what makes an army strong. Discipline. From now on, Mr. Laval, you will have to learn to obey. THE MONTOIRE MEETING, OCTOBER 24TH, 1940 I am pleased to shake hands with the Frenchman who is not responsible for this war. "I am pleased to shake hands with the man who was not responsible for this war." I freely accepted the Führer's invitation. I was not subject to any diktat or pressure on his part. A collaboration between our two countries has been envisaged. For all those who are awaiting France's salvation, I would like to say that this salvation is now in our hands. To those who doubt, who persist, I remind you that excessive rigidity can make the best intentions and pride lose all their power. It is in honor and to maintain French unity, a unity spanning ten centuries and with a view to constructive activity within the new European order that I begin on the path of collaboration today. History will judge me alone. Madame Petain. - Your car awaits. - Thank you. It's so cold. I hope it's well heated. Unfortunately not, Madam. Pity. As long as the food is good. What's wrong? Apparently Jews are prohibited from entering Vichy. What does she care? She's a musician. Law of July 16th, 1940. In lieu of "by order and mandate of the Republic," the correct term shall be "by order and mandate of the Marshal of France." The national revolution plan no longer rests on the delusion of natural equality. Law of September 27th, 1940. Establishment of a court-martial. Prohibition on German refugees leaving the country. General councils are hereby suspended to be replaced by non-elected commissions. Ban on trade union centers and employers' and workers' organizations. Léon Blum, Georges Mandel, Vincent Auriol, Jules Moch, Marx Dormoy, Édouard Daladier. Abolition of political parties and parliamentary allowances. The sacks have arrived. Gentlemen, I remind you that mail is within my remit. Mail, perhaps. But not denunciations. Here. This is a good one. "Dear venerated Marshal, I don't want to be an informer but it is my duty to tell you that a teacher in the village, Miss Santos, presumably of foreign origin, is a fervent nudist. I need not make comment on what a disastrous example she sets." - Is it signed? - A true French citizen. I have better: "A healthy member of the population." Listen: "Mr. Dujardin, secretary of the town hall is burning catechisms." What is it, Alibert? Heartburn, perhaps? The correspondent shows an exaggerated but sincere enthusiasm. I will not make a mockery of the national revolution! Our citizens certainly display literary genius. Denouncing one another. What fun. - Aren't you in the kitchen at this hour? - Shut up. What about you, bringing in those sacks each day? I'm not the one sending them. 3,000 letters a day! It's no picnic. François, he's doing what he's told. It's his job. That's all. You'd better go and check on the orchestra. It's not going well. Every day, my love You are leading on A lowly woman Who has sworn to be yours God damn it. When your heart's not in it, your heart's not in it. If Judith leaves, we all leave. Don't worry. I'll talk to the Marshal's wife. I will. She seems nice. Plus, between us women, we'll come to an understanding. No need for drama. Jews are Jews. It's not a crime. If my great policy has not been successful it's Mr. Laval's fault. Who does he think he is? Did France choose him or me? I'll never forgive Laval For the ambush in Montoir. Hitler… Hitler does grant anything! I sense the French were not happy about the meeting. Please hold. Mr. Laval insists on speaking to the Marshal about Paris. What ashes? The Duke of Reichstadt? The Germans want to return the Duke of Reichstadt's ashes to France? What does this have to do with me? It's a great opportunity. You'll walk with the Chancellor, inspect the German troops with him. Not everyone gets to do that. The 15 December is in four days. - It's all taken care of. - Once again, against my will. Marshal, the French love the Duke, Napoleon II. - He's a national treasure. - I don't care about Napoleon II! The son of Napoleon's ashes will be spread at dusk. The Germans love that. It's the Wagnerian side. It is not up to me to accept Hitler's summons, Laval. - Excuse me? - I'm talking about my authority. I do not doubt your authority, Marshal. But Hitler will be furious. It was he who came up with the idea. No, Mr. Laval. I'm afraid France will pay dearly if you refuse. Did you hear? He insisted, and with such arrogance. Did I do the right thing, my friend? Absolutely right. This Napoleon business is ridiculous. France needs coal, not ashes. Good evening. I didn't want to disturb you. You should have stayed in Villeneuve. This is no place for you. Don't worry, I won't get under your feet. If you prefer, I'll go to the hermitage. I can't bear to be around these tarts Ménétrel brings you very day. - Eugénie, you can't… - I'm not criticizing. I find it admirable. You're in good health. I've never seen you happier than since you've been in power. - Listen, Eugénie. - I understand. You've been waiting for this moment all your life. Before then you only earned your stripes through your seniority. Miss. Did you know the Marshal was already retired? At the start of the war in 1914. - But… - Don't get me started on our marriage. - You forced me to marry you. - Precisely. With a revolver to your head. I would have pulled the trigger, you know. I divorced for you and I wasn't about to accept another refusal. Anyway, forget all that. Circumstances have made you supreme leader. - This is not a matter for a woman. - Let me be the judge of that. I don't want to interfere in your politics. But I am allowed to protect you. - Protect me? - From yourself. You have two small flaws. Each of them is forgivable. But together they can do the greatest harm to a man of your age. You're vain and power hungry, Phillippe. You waited so long for it that you may not know how to leave in time. One day history may judge you badly. So allow me to prepare you defense. You can't hide from me, you know. Speaking of which. That maid told me about one of the girls in the orchestra. - Which one? - A brunette. Rather prickly. I see who you mean. - She's a Jew. - Well I never. She's a Jew but her father is French and he fought in the war. - And they're making her life difficult. - That's the law. I'll sort it. We'll find an exemption. Not a word to Bernard. He's very strict with these people. This paper. It's Déat's mistake. The straw that broke the camel's back. Laval is clearly behind this. Gentlemen, let me tell you. The Marshal is beside himself. - They're attacking him personally. - It's time to get rid of him. Absolutely. Once and for all. Do you hear, Dumoulin? "He has betrayed the confidence the Marshal has built when France is recovering and must find itself. We must no longer put its fate in the hands of sectarians, boors, troublemakers - and the notoriously incompetent." - Alright, we've read it, thanks. This is a good polemic. Makes you want to shout "names! names!" It's not a laughing matter. Here. "in the hands of sectarians." Like Alibert. I find the style banal. Boors like Gillouin, Troublemakers like Baudouin and incompetent types like the lot of us. Let's prove Déat wrong. What shall we do? You're Minister of the Interior. It's your problem. We can't arrest Laval without arresting the fools from the press campaign. - We need to get Déat first. - Arrest him in Paris? No problem. If Vichy has a representative there, use him. I warned him just in case. He'll arrest Déat the moment I give the signal. - Everyone is watching everyone else. - We have a password. What is it? That's my business! Yes, but in case there's an issue? Alibert is right, we need to know. Well, it's… "The Marshal has crossed the line." - Why the Marshal? - It came to me like that. Look, the important thing is to stop Laval. - Consider it done. - He thinks himself - a political end! - Bougnaparte thinks he's Talleyrand. The table is freezing. It feels good. - It's sorted. Judith can stay. - That's good news. Hold still. Better return to the Marshal's wife. You'll need days for the foreigners and communists. They're kicking them out by the thousands. People like Antonio, Judith, and others. And it's not over. I'm doing what I can. I'm not the President of the Republic I didn't ask the Germans to come. It's not the Germans, it's the French! I don't care about your politics. You're never happy. The Marshal is on board. He'll play along. Between us, Gillouin. It's amazing - his ability to hide. - I agree. Alibert. Aren't you coming to the meeting? No. I have to telephone the password to the Minister of Justice discreetly so that they arrest Déat. And I want to stop at the chapel. Pray it works out. You know, I'm a man of science. I don't know that a prayer will help you. Let me tell you your horoscope. It's December 13th. Friday 13th. That's great for us. Excellent. I'd like you to sign these resignation letters first. It's just a formality. I have no intention of using them. But in the troubled situation we are in, the government could dissolve at any moment. Mr. Laval. Sign. Thank you. Thank you. Please, my friend. I'm not talking about the Marshal. I'm telling you, "the Marshal has crossed the line." Does that mean nothing to you? The Marshal has crossed the line! The password, my friend. The password! Gentlemen. I've read your letters. Mr. Laval's resignation has been accepted. - There's been a misunderstanding. - I have nothing to add. The meeting is over. Please leave the room. Marshal, I demand an explanation. I do not have to give you any. Your press has never ceased to incriminate my government and entourage. I swear I have nothing to do with it. Every time we go to Paris, there's a new string of hassles. Not to mention Montoir. The forced meeting that you imposed upon me with Hitler. I was only ever thinking about France. The Germans will not like your attitude. - You're behaving like an ingrate. - Shut up! The French don't like you. You no longer have my trust. You do not have my trust. You do not have my trust! This saddens me, Marshal. I've seen how you work. You're like a weathercock that turns with every wind. I'll be back. Each time I've been chased away, I've come back. I thought I was full of cynicism but I'm like a child compared to this old fool. Besides, I'm sick of the stench of this swamp in Vichy. Let me tell you, the socialists of Aubervilliers, the communists, the metalworkers, the little suburbanites, they're lords compared to this lot. Come on boys, hurry up! First section, second section, third section! Go, go, go! Go! Laval's floor! You'll see, I bet they're going to They'll do anything, you know. DIVIDING LINE Royal pair, , and another one, and a ten of hearts. - Damn it! - What now? The Krauts! Warn the Marshal. Welcome, your excellency. Did you have a good journey, Councilor? We weren't expecting you yet. The brave are never too early. - Where is the Marshal? - He will be surprised at the hour. He's waiting for you, gentlemen. May I show you your rooms? - No. - To give you the chance to freshen up! To warm up, I mean. To have a cup of coffee. We weren't expecting such a crowd. Welcome, your Excellency. Please take a seat. How is Herr Hitler? Herr Hitler? Marshal, To tell you the truth, Herr Hitler is questioning the sense behind the decision you just took with regard to President Laval. By dismissing him, you are putting an end to the Franco-German reconciliation. I have had enough of President Laval's pretensions. He is my subordinate. I've been the head of state for five months and he is my subordinate. He reports to me. I am not satisfied with his services so I am replacing him. That, Mr. Abetz, is what I did. You're replacing him? Do I understand correctly? - And sending him to prison. - Me? - I don't know anything about that. - That's what's happening. Mr. Laval's presidency earned him Herr Hitler's friendship. The Führer is starting to consider your actions as a personal affront. Which is regrettable. The message I have been sent to give you is crystal clear. Bring back Laval, otherwise the collaboration policy - as he defined it… - As we defined it, Herr Hitler and I, at Montoir. As we defined it six weeks ago. And you were present, Mr. Abetz. Please take a seat. I've written a letter to Herr Hitler. He's a man of authority, a soldier. He'll understand. He's not an easy character. He was at Verdun, like me. He'll understand. France has been defeated, Marshal. We signed an armistice and I am conforming to it. I am still free to form my own government as I see fit. The French chose me, the man who gained victory in Verdun. Mr. Laval has not earned the French people's trust. I can show you the letters we receive each day. The French like me, not him. Who is Mr. Laval? A trickster. A parliamentarian. He'd be nothing without me. Have the Germans come to rescue you Mr. Pierre? Yes. It was easy to stop and arrest me. But they might not be able to stop what's about to happen. - Anyway. - Good luck, Mr. Pierre. Try to see the year in well, at least. Early this morning the Wehrmacht's Panzers entered Russia! JACQUES DORIOT 22 JUNE 1941 I welcome this event like a sailor who, after a stormy night, welcomes the dawn. I declare on behalf of myself and my party, that if any war is welcome, it is this one. When I see this war opening up, I see that it will save the French from fighting in their own country in the next few months or years. The French Popular Party has asked the Marshal to create a legion of French volunteers to go and fight against Bolshevism alongside the Wehrmacht. Sieg heil! Sieg heil! Sieg heil! Marcel Déat reviews volunteers joining the German army on the Russian front. He is accompanied by Pierre Laval, former minister. An armed man has just shot Laval! A shot was fired! The crowd is screaming! He was saved by one of his cufflinks. It was deflected. You'll be happy to hear the enforced rest has been beneficial. As one of our prefects noted, his assassination has rejuvenated him. Quite the turn of phrase. What is certain is that the people showed a lot of sympathy for President Laval. Really? What about you, Mr. Pucheu? The black market is developing. I have a report here from one of our prefects. "The peasant class is dominated by the desire for gain." Gazagne, prefect of the Landes. "It feeds its own egoism," Carl, prefect of Arras. On average, the price of meat is ten times higher and butter fifteen times. How unfortunate. And the workers? They are hostile. They don't understand corporations. They miss the unions. What's more, - there's dissent. - Alright. I said dissent. What are you trying to say? - The communists? - Not only them, Marshal. Terrorists. We listen to London radio a lot, Marshal. Worse, there have been terrorist attacks. There's no other word for it. The attacks are multiplying. Ladies and Gentlemen, You are about to hear a speech from Marshal Pétain, head of the French state. Citizens of France, have a grave announcement to make. There's been a bad wind rising in several regions for several weeks now. Doubt is taking hold. It is gripping certain people. The authority of my government is being questioned. Orders are being badly executed. All ministers and high officials must take an oath of loyalty to me and undertake to perform the duty of their offices for the good of the state. Marshal, I pledge allegiance. - I pledge to carry out my duties. - I pledge loyalty to you. - I pledge my loyalty to you. - I pledge to carry out my duties. Marshal, I pledge my loyalty to you. By the laws of honor and integrity By the laws of honor and integrity. All the prefects have taken the oath. - Every one? - The magistrates have done the same. - All of them? - All but one. This is bad. What's his name? Barthélemy will tell you. I don't have his name. He was immediately dismissed from his post pending heavier penalties. - No other incidents? - Paul Didier. None. The directors of central administration and national education have all taken an oath. Let me tell you, Marshal, All the elites of the nation have pledged allegiance to you. Can I? That doesn't look comfortable. Let me help you. Don't you want to get up? There. I'll leave you alone. Drink it while it's hot. Goodnight, Mr. Pétain. - Young lady? - Yes? Come here a moment. Give me your hand. What's your name, my child? Colette. Colette Vignolet. Colette Vignolet. You're very sweet. If I were a few years younger. Are you engaged? I got married the day you arrived, remember? You congratulated me. My child, all my life I've obeyed. That's how I became Marshal. And that's how you'll become a brave, good mother. We should create a day of celebration for all mothers in France. Have you seen the time? We were talking about France. - With the Marshal? - What about France? We have to have children. We have to obey to serve our country. Silly girl! It's not by obeying that you become a patriot. He even said he'd be godfather to our eldest. He's going a bit far, your Marshal. Soon you'll be spending more time with him than me. You know he's not all that. There have been more arrests. Even reports of torture. It's not him doing it. He must be very upset about it. So is he coming back? For morale? Look what he's doing! God damn it! You don't understand anything. Be careful, it's fragile. Yeah. - Where are you going? - To Paris. - It's dangerous for… - We're hidden in plain sight. We go where our art takes us. Vichy is just a small town. I'll let you go then. - Good luck. - Thank you. This is London. The French speak to the French. BUSTS Do not despair. We'll get them! Do not stop resisting! Don't forget the letter V. Write it, sing it, V, V, V, V. On the walls, on the pavements. Write Vs. Yes, you can make the beetles mad No remorse No danger Sing and whistle V, V, V, V! This morning, a German officer was assassinated in Paris. - Did they get him? - No. - That's the problem. - Who did it? Let the Germans settle their own scores. Let's police ourselves. Let's not allow the Germans to do it for us. This is no longer a question of leaflets or scribbles on walls. Our police are carrying out checks and arrests all over Paris. But we don't have any effective legal instruments because the law we are drafting has not yet been adopted. I propose to the Council that the text in question enter into force with immediate effect. A few death sentences will make them think. Please wait. If the Marshal signs the law now, what will become of previous offenders? We will simply add a clause giving the regulations retroactive effect. - That's against all our principles. - Principles? We're at war! This is an exceptional law! Heads must roll! Tell me you're no going to start defending communists? A retroactive law is out of the question. Even for communists. What does the President of the Council say? I think it makes sense. Listen, Pucheu, I trust you. Come to an arrangement with the Minister of Justice. If we organize a suppression ourselves, if we condemn Jews and communists in prison and revoke common rights, We can prevent the Germans from taking hostages from our population. You want to replace hostages with innocent people? You're going to convict people who haven't committed any crimes! People who were in prison at the time of the crime. People who have already been convicted of other things. What about the nation's interests? Try finding a single judge to compromise himself for this denial of justice. Minister of Justice, 80 MPs refused to vote for giving us full power. How many judges refused to take the oath? Of thousands? Just one! I'll find one. And you're going to help me. I want our courts to sentence by order. Extraordinary courts. - This is to appease the Germans? - So it's political. - Are we going to guillotine the French? - Gentlemen, an order is an order. Another Kraut killed, Dumoulin. They're planning to shoot 50 hostages in Chateaubriand. This has to stop. All this blood will be on our hands. - You must protest, Marshal. - Of course we're going to protest. But it won't be enough. We have to thwart these actions, stop this massacre. - What can we do? - I have a way. We'll go straight to Paris and I'll be taken prisoner. You, Marshal? Yes, me. From now on, I'll be the only hostage. "Herr Führer, I am writing to you to ask you to stop these bloody reprisals. I hereby inform you of my irrevocable decision …and I stress, "irrevocable" … to constitute myself a prisoner. Philippe Pétain." Marshal, if I may… What you are about to do will go down in history. Today, you are a great man. No. It'll be too easy for Herr Hitler to get rid of me. And who will protect the French? I thought Pétain was our shield. But I was wrong. Wrong I tell you! The god damn idiot is reveling in the collaboration! We have been cowardly today. Present arms. You've hurt me. - I apologize. - I have enough trouble as it is. - That's what's bothering me. - There's nothing we can do. - When the storm is brewing… - I'll be sure to find a lightning rod. Laval is a politician by profession. RANDAN FOREST MARCH 25TH, 1942 - Good morning, Mr. President. - Good morning, Marshal. We share many views about many things. Then why didn't you say? I was waiting for reports, notes. I like to see things in writing. It clears my head. Marshal, we write too much. - The walls had eyes. - No, Laval. I was extremely vexed. Take Peyruton. He would sort through prefects' reports - to exaggerate my unpopularity. - Peyruton was dismissed. Marshal, do you concede that you never shared with me what we might call the small delights of power? The delights of power? Laval. If you only knew my solitude. The higher you climb, the fewer you can confide in. Tell me. Sooner or later, the Americans will come to Europe. Do you think the Germans will make the grade? I'll be careful not to give you advice. But don't change your policies. Spare the Germans. I have my reasons. Show more flexibility with Hitler. I've been badly advised. I should never have dismissed you. Marshal. I have information. The Germans are furious. They're going to do with us what they did to Poland. You'll be ousted. France will no longer be a satellite of Germany. - Unless… - Unless? For better or worse, the Germans like me. They want me to come back. Let's face it. You and I are in trouble. So with your permission, I can help you clean up this mess. OCCUPIED PARIS JULY 1942 JEW Mr. Bousquet, I wanted us to meet without delay because we now have the same function. You're the Secretary General of the French Police and I am the head of German police in France. Cigarette? Quite right. These are American cigarettes. We're going to have, how to say, a lot on our plates. A strategic point: the Louvre ticket offices. Buses will run on rotation with approximately three round trips every two hours. That's an average capacity of 100 passengers per bus, 200 per hour, per vehicle. Given that the winter velodrome cannot hold more than 16,000 people contents should be delivered every… the numbers have not been laid out in details yet but in any case, gentlemen, we must demonstrate our zeal. But will these people be handed over to the Germans? I want to insist on this point, gentlemen. We are in France. It is essential that we make it clear that we are masters of our own territory. - France remains a great nation! - But… it's going to be theirs, I mean… - We do not have a rogatory commission. - It will all be done legally, gentlemen. You will have a signed order. I will take full responsibility. So I beg you to do the same. To summarize: Firstly, once you've checked the identity of the Jews you have been sent to arrest, you should not listen to their comments. Secondly, you should not worry about their health. Thirdly, Don't forget to cut the gas and electricity. Fourthly, The Jews may not take any pets. Give them to the concierges. You have to understand that our duty was to distract. Without asking questions. When I see all these fine minds eating at your tables… When I see Krauts I want them all out! When I see the Huns I want them to be gone! No more Jerries, they're not necessary! The issue of the children remains. We can't separate children from parents. They'll all go together. What about evacuation? No. And we can't leave them alone. Who would take care of them? It's best if they go with their parents. Unless you have another idea. Listen, Bousquet. Settle this matter post-haste and let us not return to it. Go on. Mom! Mom! Go on. JEW "We can consider this roundup… this roundup a complete success which we owe to the diligence of the efficient Mr. Bousquet… and the cordial collaboration of the entire French police force." THE HANDOVER CONTINUES As a result of the Marshal's new handover policy, these prisoners are being exchanged for workers being sent to Germany. The more volunteers there are the more people can come home. Perhaps your husband, son, or father. You will be sent to work in the same conditions as the Germans but keep your French citizenship. You won't be alone. You'll find many of your French compatriots there. They, like you, enjoy the physical and moral comfort of French organization. You will maintain relations with your fatherland, and you will be permitted to visit during your service. ID check! Marshal, may I request your opinion? I've prepared my speech for the radio this evening to announce the decisions made and one sentence has caused bickering. Let me see. "Germany is fighting a great battle to build this new Europe. I believe in a German victory. because without it, Bolshevism will take hold everywhere." I told the President he was under no obligation to say that, because France has signed an armistice. - Neutral, in a way. - The sentence is absurd. How can you write: "I believe in the victory of Germany"? This is a military matter and your pacifism has caused enough bother. - Marshal, if I may… - Look, simply write: "I hope for the victory of Germany." You can say that, it's your opinion. Nobody will take you to court. I hope for the victory of Germany, because without it, Bolshevism will take hold everywhere. Workers of France, for the liberation of our prisoners, go and work in Germany. Go in large numbers for the sake of our country. Help France find its place in this new Europe. Answer my call. In return you shall have the gratitude of the nation François! - We have to go and work in Germany! - I'm not going. - It's compulsory. - Obeying is not compulsory. If we don't, where will we go? That's it. I've been thinking about it for a while. And now's the time. I'm going to join the Resistance. - Don't worry, we won't be alone. - Aren't you afraid? - Then I'm going with you. - Out of the question. I'm going to be frank, Marshal. Voluntary work in Germany had a chance of working. But compulsory labor imposed by occupying forces would be a disaster. And it's backfired. I've had very consistent reports. Handfuls of them. - The French don't want to go away. - Voluntarily or otherwise. That saddens me. The lack of will to free our prisoners. Their fellow countrymen. They are losing confidence. Management don't care. They don't need the black market to eat. Goodbye, Mr. Léon. That's all I could bring. If you can, try to increase rations. We're growing in number. Alain? Here. Some ham. - Hi Colette. - Hello. Don't cry, Mom. I can't hide. They're going to send me to Germany. Your father imprisoned. Your brother imprisoned. Your sister in Limoges… What will I do all alone? Can't you hide here? - Here? - I mean… With me, nearby. In the city. For the men who brought about defeat We want their heads delivered to us Bring us that infamous post Militia men, lets make France pure again Bolsheviks, freemasons, all enemies Israelis, vile rotten beasts France is sick, it's spitting you out By naming us his best soldiers, the Marshal has given us a title we can be proud of. And we must remain worthy! Against Gaullist dissidents, - for French unity! - Yes! Against the oversight of crimes! - For the punishment of those responsible! - Yes! Following the Anglo-American landing in North Africa, Pétain has decided to break off diplomatic relations with the USA. He has given the following orders to our armed forces: "We are being attacked. We shall defend ourselves." In Algers Admiral Darlan has just signed an armistice with the Americans, but the Marshal has maintained his line. President Laval left urgently to meet with leaders of the Reich. This morning, November 11th, 1942, Chancellor Hitler has declared himself forced to order his troops to cross the free zone to protect the Mediterranean coast of France. It was at that moment that I asked myself: "Am I still a good Frenchman?" - Good day. - Good day. I understand you want to discharge him and take full powers. But one thing must be clear. No more war. No ceding of territory. You have my word. In writing, too. Please understand Mrs. Pétain that double dealing is no longer an option. There are only two policies: de Gaulle's and mine. Either the Germans win the war and I sign an honorable peace agreement or they lose and I will be hanged. What about Laval? Did he get his full powers? The French are still writing to you a lot. "Marshal, night has fallen upon France. If you can do nothing in the face of this misery and these hostages being shot, your nights must be filled with nightmares. Resign." Another letter. "You are leaving your successor, President Laval, a France that is battered, torn and tormented. You say you want a unified France but you have only resurrected our history's evil genius: Civil war. Vichy is now only a phantom government. The history of this Merovingian court barely remains of interest. Robert O. Paxton. It has become certain that we will face landings. It is therefore important - to consider measures for your safety. - Out of the question. I have never been down into a shelter. I will not go into the catacombs. There are better places. A castle - in Germany, for example. - No, no, no. I don't want the French resistance to take you. It's all just a big show. Have you thought about the speech I told you to prepare? It has to be ready - to be played when the landing happens. - There won't be any landing. Do you believe a landing will happen? Well then. Our defenses are too strong. Don't you see? The war is over. For several months now, Mr. Darnand, I've been receiving Disastrous reports about the behavior of your men. A minority of course. But an active minority teetering between delinquency and crime. The militia has become an actor of civil war. Toughen up, Mr. Darnand. You must shoot to set an example in your ranks. Otherwise, gangrene will set in. Shoot? Marshal… My men are not mutineers. They are committed. Committed to following you orders to quash dissidence. They have given their bodies and souls to protect you. And so far you have been nothing but encouraging. But now… the tide has turned. You want to please the Americans. You are passing the buck to us, Marshal. And it comes as a bitter disillusionment for me. PARIS, HÔTEL MATIGNON, 17 AUGUST 1944 THE AMERICANS ARE APPROACHING PARIS. Bye, Dad. Stay optimistic. Here. A small gift. What is it? Marshal Göring started the trend. He calls it the passport to Valhalla. Its real name is cyanide. It gets you to heaven in 20 seconds. Follow our lead. Keep it on you at all times. You never know. Gentlemen, we won't fight under the Marshal's bed. Here, Bernard. Tell me what you think. Th country has charged me with a mission. I only have today to accomplish it. I don't want people to say that Pétain has betrayed the trust of the French. Bernard, what is he doing? He's writing, Mrs. Pétain. A constitution. A constitution? Today of all days? Ah, it's you. I know I'm your prisoner. Will you allow me to get dressed? Present… arms! Come children of the fatherland The day of glory has arrived Against us, tyranny The bloody standard is raised The bloody standard is raised You will hear… HOHENZOLLERN CASTLE, SIGMARINGEN, GERMANY MARCH 1945 …A NEW FRENCH CONSTITUTION… Another point made to the jury: you were always in the American camp. But without ever being able to say it. The resistance. Listen to what I've prepared. "One, I always resisted the Germans. Two, I could only ever have been in favor of the resistance. The resistance is the sign of a country's vitality. Three, as head of state, I could not publicly approve resistance in the presence of the occupier. Are you writing this down? "Why did I return to power? To defend and protect my country. If I have committed a crime, then I have committed it against myself and my own people." - Good day Marshal. - Well? How are you, President? - I've come to bid you farewell. - What's happening? I'm being transferred to Wilflingen. It's not far. Six miles or so from here. - They're taking good care of you. - Always so kind. Come now. Don't lose your sense of humor. Tell me Laval, aren't you leaving right away? Won't you come with me? They're still shooting. They're coming. This time it really is the end. What will become of you? We'll have to get out of here soon, Marshal. Article 75 is no joke. They want me dead. But I won't give them the satisfaction. It's not that I value my life that much. I just wouldn't want to give them that. I contacted the Swiss. They weren't all that happy, but… If it comes to it, Franco won't refuse me his hospitality. What about you, Marshal? Now that Hitler is done for, I'm going home. - Do you think that's a good idea? - De Gaulle has what he wanted. I don't see why he'd go after me. Maybe not de Gaulle, but… Behind him there's the Resistance, the Communists, the Jews, the freemasons… De Gaulle is smarter than the Communists. As for the freemasons… they'll come to some arrangement. - Then there's the Jews. - Tough. What could I have done? You… You're different. In any case, both of us only ever wanted to serve France. And we wanted Germany to succeed. - You believed it longer than I did. - I wanted it longer than you did. But you never went through with your commitments. I did. You left me the role of the traitor, the villain, while you were the archangel. - I was the shield. - And de Gaulle the sword. You're wrong. You turned a blind eye. I assumed my role, took on my responsibilities. I went all the way. But I'm a man of politics. In truth, the only choice the French had to make was de Gaulle or me. We were on the same side. If they find me, they'll kill me. You'll be able to save your skin. You see, there is a difference. I have something you lack. What? Courage. Pierre Laval was sentenced to death on October 9th, 1945. He tried to end his life with a cyanide capsule. He was revived and taken to the posts where he was shot, half paralyzed. Phillippe Pétain fled to Switzerland and then surrendered to the French authorities He was sentenced to death on August 15th, 1945. He was stripped of his titles and expelled from the Académie française. Due to his age, his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. He was interned on the Île d'Yeu and died there on 23 July 1951. "Pétainism" was never judged as a crime. Subtitle translation by: Holly James
