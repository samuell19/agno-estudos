I think this was a new record interms of heartbeat. But you hardly ever described your feelings in trance .. .. in so much detail. I think we are right on track. You'll feel better. I didn't mean to complain. [chuckles] In here you can complain as much as you want. Have you ever been to Thailand? No, not yet. I always wanted to travel together with Natascha... Never happened. And then it wastoo late. [chuckles] So I'll go on my ownnow. Titus isn't coming with you? No, he has all these rehearsalsgoing on. Your pills. Once every three days in the evening. As usual. Sure!

Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too, Gai. If you like, maybe we can have adrink together? If you don't mind that I haven'thad a shower all day long ..? A girl ..? Typical Asian. Big eyes, absolutely beautiful. [chuckles] And she can even speak German. Cool, so she won't be annoyed byyour English. Love you, too! How are you feeling .. being back in the city? Any dreams ..? Not a single one. I'm feeling great. Happy to hear that. How's the orchestra performancedoing? Quite well! Pretty sure it'll be even betterthan last year! Looking forward to your opinionon it. Emm ..

[both] See you in a bit. [exhales] [pop up] [instistinct radio music playing] Of course everybody knew. They've been gone for one hour .. .. and then they're coming downfrom the gallery .. .. a new affair each year. Thanks. No wonder this drives our choirmast er crazy. Mmmmh! Any good? Excellent! Glad to hear that. I was deeply worried about you yesterday. [sighs] You probably were right and I overestimated my condition .. .. without my pills .. .. and some jetlag in addition .. Maybe. But I was referring to .. Bangkok. [softly] I don't know. Did I send you the picture fromGai and me? No, not yet. That's her? [chuckles] That was her first Ja√§germeister experience. Let me get a prettier one. Care for another coffee? Yes, please. - [cup pushing] Was she originally from Bangkok? Mmmh! Because if the Thais are comingfrom the countryside .. [indistinct] .. it's a huge dealfor them to be in the big city for the first time .. .. the city just swallows you ..and spits you out again at one point .. [normal voice] Huh? - Mmh? Yes. Crazy .. When do you need to leave today? Quite soon. Why? Can I have the car? Don't want to take the train toDr. Jung today .. Sure. I'll be in the dome all day long anyway. Can I really leave you on your own? I could as well .. No, nonsense .. of course .. Get lost. Love you. I do, too. And keep eating! - [chuckles] Yes. Bye! - Bye. Feli, I know all of this will not make any sense to you .. .. and that it's impossible to understand. But you need to trust me. You are in danger! You need to find the original ofthis image! [strictly] Please! [mysterious music playing] [whispering] Fuck. What's goingon here? [exhales] Where the hell are you? [ticking sound speeding up] [softly music playing] [indistinct chatter] [disco music playing] I've ordered something typical German for us! Sounds like fun! Thank you so much for everythingtoday .. .. it was just amazing! Well .. that is just Bangkok. I can't tell you how much I missed dancing. Don't you go dancing in Berlin as well? Did I say something wrong? [softly] No. I just thought about my best friend .. Natascha and I used to party every weekend. [sadly] We always wanted to travel to Thailand together. Feli, I need to tell you something. Sorry. I didn't want to spoil our night. Cheers to Thailand! Ugh! [chuckles] Come on. You can do the rest. Really? Yeeees. Aaaaah. Are you on facebook? Not with that stupid Jagermeister in my hand! Let me see. Come on! [dramatic music playing] We have to go. So early? Now! Please! Why? Quickly! Gai, what's going on? What's going on? [both panting] What do they want from us? Who are they?! Gai?! I can't tell you. Gai, you are starting to frighten me .. Come on! [speaking Thai] [breathing heavily] Please - please take the money. What are you doing? Please take the money!! No! Here's my bag! Please! Run! [breathing in panic] [sobbing] [breathing deeply] [speaking Thai] [dramatic music playing] Taxi! [indistinct airport chatter] [turbine noise] [mailbox] This is Titus speaking. I'm currently unavailable, leave a message. Shit! What are you trying to do? Oh my god, I am so sorry .. I just .. [strictly] .. no, this IS my apartment! What are you talking about? How did you get in here? Have a nice day. I don't have time for this. [putting foot in door] Are you crazy? Stop it! Let me enter my appartment immediately. If you're not leaving right nowl'll call the police. You will call the police? I willcall the police! Mrs. Peters? Didn't expect to see you again. Is there a problem? No. No, this young lady was about toleave. [slamming door] [mailbox] This is Titus speaking. I'm currently unavailable .. [orchestral singing and indistinct chatter] [softly] Titus .. Feli ..?! [sobs] I can't stand it anymore. [softly] Hey. What happened? What have you done? First Thailand .. and then .. .. then I'm back home and my appartment is gone. What do you mean .. it's gone? There's an unknown woman in my place .. .. claiming that she lives there. I've been thrown out from my ownappartment - Feli - there is no one in your appartment! But - You moved out! What? Yes. Right before your vacation. You can't remember anything? [stuttering] That's impossible. All your stuff is in my cellar .. You canceled the rent. Moved out. You went to Thailand to get a clear head. No. Yes. No. No. No reason to freak out .. No reason .. my apartment is gone! This can't be true. [sobs] That's all a big pile ofshit! Feli, what happened? What happened? Yesterday .. Yes ..? I .. Yes ..? I .. I did .. Hey .. hey, hey. [sniffing] It will be alright. Okay? Look .. Take my keys. Go home to my place and try to get some sleep. You're suffering from a jetlag. Okay? I hope you still know where I live? I hope so. [softly] Feli? Mmmh? Good to have you back home. I missed you. [softly] Missed you, too. Get some rest. [unlocking door] [exhales] [sniffs] [ticking sound speeding up] [exhales] [tense music playing] [exhales] [orchestra music playing] [wind blowing softly] Beautiful, isn't it? God, you scared me to death. It is you. Wouldn't have expected to ever meet you. Do you live here? Well... it's dry after all. I do have music. And I am not alone. This one here .. this is YOU inthe picture. Right? Where did you get these from? They were scattered all over theplace when I first came here. In drawers .. on the floor .. I've collected them and put themon my wall. Feels like this place was abandoned in a hurry. Strange, huh? Closed down .. Just like this. Do you know what happened here? I don't know. I haven't been here in a long time. [exhales] I can barely remember anything from those days. Sometimes you're better off thatway. Have you seen this picture before? No, I haven't. Why did you say this earlier? That you wouldn't have thought to ever meet me. Why would you say that? Your friend, the one from the picture .. .. she shows up here regularly. What are you talking about? Natascha lives in .. .. a secured hospital for mentalillnesses. I know. How could you possibly know that? The guys that always catch her again .. .. are real pros. That's impossible. Natascha can't even go outside anymore. If you say so. They used to come after her within a few hours .. .. more recently it sometimes takes just minutes. That's just impossible. You seem to know that for sure. You probably visit her on a regular basis? I don't think so. Even if that would be true ..how could she possibly get here? She's definitely not taking the bus .. .. she's always bleeding way toomuch for that. What do you mean "she's bleeding"? Why do you keep asking me? Isn't she your friend? I guess I'd rather go now. What if she stops showing up here at one point? [calls after] You should hurry up .. .. before the visiting time is over .. .. FELI. [dramatic beat] [melancholic music playing] [softly] When did I move in? What ..? What makes you ask that? Something's really wrong. I can remember certain things clearly .. .. others seem to be completelyerased. Why did I think I was living inmy old place? [softly] You just had a tough time recently .. .. and I was not there for you. I'm sorry. Mmh? But I promise you: Only two daysleft .. .. then the premiere is over .. .. and I will be going on your nerves day and night. Just two more days. Okay? [distorted] Feli, I need to tellyou something. [indistinct voices] [distorted] You are in danger! Natascha? [mysterious music] [indistant children's chatter] [shouts] GAI..! [gasps] Can you breathe? Breathe. It's okay. Have some water. [breathless] What was that? You came out of the hypnosis onyour own spontaneously .. .. which barely ever happens ..and it needs a strong trigger. Do you remember .. .. the last thing you just saw? [panting] My first meeting with Natascha. In school. .. our orphanage. You described that. Was there anything else? Just the two of us. Did you encounter any stressfulsituations during your vacation? [hesitant] Why? Because .. your .. Ah .. just accidentally hit my head. Mmhmh. Thailand had a real positive effect on me. Lots of time to think. Of course I thought about Natascha .. [softly] .. and if I could havechanged anything .. .. if I had realized it earlier. I'm wondering if I should visither more often. I think so, yes. I definitely should! Felicitas .. .. not even therapists are ableto predict every mental breakdown. You couldn't have saved her. But I think I'd feel better If Icould see her more often. If that is what you want I can make a call for you. Thank you. Hi. I have an appointment with Mrs. Schwarz. And what's your name? Peters. [door buzzes] [mysterious music playing] Good morning, Mrs. Schwarz. Youhave a visitor. You have 15 minutes. [soft music playing] Natascha? Hey .. .. it's me .. Feli. I know it's been a while since I.. [dramatic sound] Hey .. [whispering] They will .. What? .. they will get us. What did you say? [voice over radio] Emergency onstation three. You can safely go. [clattering] Hey ..! Stop! [in distance] Stop her! Tascha?! Please give me any sign you understand what I am saying, okay? [woman shrieking] I haven't visited you for a longtime and I am terribly sorry forthat. But there is crazy stuff going on in my life .. .. which I have no explanation for. Natascha, you need to help me. Do you know this picture? Do you know where I can find it? Do you have it? [shrieking] Calm down! Go away! Calm down! No, no. no go ..! What did you do to her? I didn't do anything ..! Leave, immediately! [dramatic music playing] [groans] [distant screams] [screams stop abruptly] [alarm blaring] What are you doing? You are not allowed to be here! [both groan] Stop! Help! Stop! - Don't move! Stop! - Don't move! [door buzzes] Fuck! [squealing tires] [screaming] Natascha! Natascha! [in distance] Over here! Here. Tascha! Tascha! Natascha! It has never been that worse. I need to get her out of here! What happened? I have no clue .. .. I visited her and showed herthat picture of us. And all of a sudden she freakedout completely! Thank you. Anytime. [coughing] You will be fine. [strictly] Stay with me, okay? [groans] - Slowly, slowly .. It's all right. [powerless] Feli. [strictly] No. Alright. I'm not touching you. [in pain] I will do that on my own. [groaning and exhaling] Can I leave you alone for a while? I'll go home, get you some clothes. Don't let anyone in. Okay? Will be right back. [softly sobbing] [mobile buzzes] Where have you been? I was trying to call you. I wasworried. [softly] I am sorry. I cooked dinner. All cold by now. [softly] That's sweet. Thank you. [sighs] Titus, believe me, I .. Since you returned .. I do understand how you feel .. but .. [exhales] .. it hurts to see you like this.. .. I can't help you if you don'tallow me to. Just talk to me! I can't tell you yet. But you could tell Natascha, couldn't you? Mmh! How do you know that? What? [strictly] How do you know that? That does not matter now, does it? You simply can't know that! Please, just do me a favor and take your pills again! Feli! NO! I am sorry! - Leave me alone! You totally know how I am feeling right now! [softly] Here. Check if there'sanything your size. [whispering] Come here. Everything will be alright. [indistinct children laughing] [mysterious dark sound playing] This is where Arthur used to live .. .. he was very ill, but always in a good mood. And that room over there was Clara's .. You are silly. You can't possibly know all those kids. Yes I do. But they are all long gone and have grown up. No, they are not. Clara never wants to grow up. You just cannot know them. Yes, I CAN! Hey? What are you two arguing about? Natascha says she knows all thekids that used to live here. Is that so? She's lying. She just can't. Sure I can! Listen to me closely, you two. No. She cannot. Natascha is just fooling aroundwith you. Even when I came here for the first time .. .. even back then there were noill children here anymore. Not even I used to know them. And now you'd rather go .. .. to your rooms, it's about time to sleep. [squieking noise - distorted speaking] You are making good progress. It's getting better. Help us. No! No! No! .. No! [distorted screaming] No, Gai .. don't do it! How long have you been sitting here? Quite a while. Couldn't you sleep? I feel like I've slept enough for the rest of my life. After all this time I want to be.. .. awake. Do you understand? It's all coming back slowly. In diffuse images. [softly] As if you never neededthat medical treatment. Yes. Like that. Thanks to you. How did you get me out of there? You got a panic attack when I visited you yesterday. They sent me out of your room. What happened afterwards .. I have no clue. You've been in a contained roomwith lots of people around you.. .. but all of a sudden you justvanished. I found you in our old orphanage.. .. twenty minutes away. Help me to remember. What else do you know? I know nothing. You were talking in your sleep .. .. screaming, actually. These are nightmares. They are haunting my forever. I always dream of the two of usas kids. I dream of my parents. But there's no big picture .. These are just nightmares. You said .. .. Gai, don't do it! Who is Gai? [whispers] If I would only knowthat. I met her in Thailand during myholidays. We got mugged. Gai had a gun and tried to defend us. Shortly before she recorded thismessage on my cellphone. [recorded video massage] Feli. I know all this .. That's us. [video message] Please! THAT S US! This is why I tried to see you. How can a complete stranger in Thailand get hold of our picture? I even found a copy of it in mylocker at the university. Did you put it there? In case I did .. I can't remember. I can't even remember that I moved out of my apartment. You moved out? Do you remember Titus? Why does she want us to find theoriginal picture ..? Looks like Gai already knew me .. .. and who gave the picture to her? But the picture has brought us this far .. .. maybe whe should follow heradvice and simply try to get it? I tried everywhere. I cannot think of any other place. However .. the only place I could not check .. .. is my old apartment. [annoyed breathing] When do you think she's coming out? Now. Do you know what I particularlyliked about this place? If you locked yourself out youwould not need professional help.. Old building. Rotten front doors. That does not make sense like this. Wait a second. Where would you hide something if you don't want it to be found? Even with someone new moving in.. .. where is no one ever cleaning? [groans] [moaning] Hurry. Can't do this for too long. [exhales] Nothing. [indistinct children laughing] Ooooh! What? [shouting] Here! [blowing] OF 20 FB 10. What's that supposed to mean? I don't know. Shit. We've not made any progress at all. [indistinct chatter over policeradio] Oh shit. The police is at our car. Fuck! Come on! [door slamming] [doorbell rings] [door buzzes] [police sirens approaching] Ok, listen. We split up. Whose adress is this? He's a friend. Do you trust him? Yes. We'll meet there. Take care. Dr. Jung, it's Feli .. I hope you are at home. We need your help. I'll be there soon. [doorbell ringing] Felicitas? Just heard your message .. Has Natascha arrived already? You're out there with Natascha?! Come on in. You might like some tea first. Dr. Jung .. .. we are in big trouble. I am so sorry to get you involved into this .. .. but I did not know where to go. Felicitas, I'm here to help. But if Natascha is out there onher own .. .. she's a danger to herself. Natasha is doing fine, really. I don't know what she told you. She told me nothing. They're pumping medicine into her .. [strictly] Felicitas, I hate totell you that .. But Natascha is a danger for herself and others .. .. and I am sorry .. .. but to rescue her from apsychiatric hospital is not thesolution! Natascha is really doing finesince she's not taking her pillsanymore. Dr. Jung, what is .. [doorbell and knocking] [door buzzes] [breathless] Hey, hello .. I know you .. .. you are one of them. Feli, he is one of them! - No, no, no! Calm down, everything is fine. He has always been with us. Tryto remember! He's treating your nightmares? - Everything is alright. Then tell her what Neuranxol ismeant for! I just want to talk, I don't mean to harm you. I'm not gonna call anyone and Iwon't turn you in. I just want to talk to you. You said .. I rescued Natascha.. No, I didn't .. I .. I said .. You said rescuing Natascha fromthe hospital was no solution. How do you know that this was me? Tell me that's not true. Tell methat you didn't give them anything! I didn't tell anyone anything ..I .. .. okay. I'll be honest. I am working as a doctor .. .. to help you, Felicitas, to encourage you .. Bullshit. .. to prevent you are endangering yourself. How could I possibly do that .. I work for a medical institutionthat is fully dedicated to supporting you .. .. by monitoring and studying the likes of you .. so you can live a normal life. A normal life. For sure! You just keep us away from it! Keep us away from what? What does all this mean? That means that's the end of thediscussion. You've gone too far. I am sorry. No, no, no, no, no, no! No. You can't do that. [panting] [both panting] [both gasping] Natascha, what was that? You vanished! No, I didn't. I went through time. You are kidding me. How's that supposed to work? The life you think you know is astraight lie.. .. do you understand? The person who you think you arehas been erased completely several times before. That photo is most likely your only way out. So are they true? My nightmares? I can't do that. I can't do that! [strictly] Sure! Sure! Yes, youcan. You can. You just forgot! You need to focus. I can't help you any further .. .. I might be able to make one or two jumps maximum. Okay? Don't even think about it. We are doing this together. I can't do this alone. You run! I try to distract them. And then what? What's with you then? - Run! [gunshot] Run! Now! I am sorry! [swooph] [swooph] NATASCHA!! [dramatic music playing] [squealing tires] [gasping softly] [woosh] [woosh] I am sorry, my son. We do not hear confessions today. You are very welcome to revert tomorrow. [door squeak] How can I help you, my child? Don't worry, you are safe here. [softly] Thank you. How did you know that I .. [chuckles] I am doing this for quite a long time now which gives you .. .. quite a bit of insight into human nature. And if you would go to church from time to time .. .. you would have chosen a lessobvious place to hide. If it would be as easy as lighting a candle .. .. to spark trust in people. And even this is tedious work. [chuckles softly] A smile suits you. You should try that more often. [sighs] That's a bit difficult these days. Do you have someone you can trust? Your parents? Your partner? My parents died when I was a kid. And with my boyfriend I can't talk about this. I am sorry to hear that. Don't you want to tell me what's on your mind? [sighs] [softly] I have been so selfish. Why couldn't I be happy with what I had? I've put my best friend in the line of danger. After my parents got killed in acar accident I lived in an orphanage. That's where I met Natascha. You both look happy. We've indeed been happy .. .. until she started to see things. To tell fantastic stories. And no one believed her. At one point they locked her away. And instead of helping her .. Iran away. I've let her rot in there. And the devil who had deceived them .. .. was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur .. .. where the beasts and the false prophet were. And they will be tormented day and night .. .. forever and ever. Chapter 20, verse 10. The Revelation of John. Of course. The St John Passion! And that is not a half-circle .. .. that's the cupola of the Berlin Dome! Thank you! Thank you so much! Now I know where to go. Isn't the cupola closed during wintertime? I do hope so. [church bells] [indistinct chatter] Hey, aren't you Titus' girlfriend? Hey. Shall I get you backstage to him? Thanks, no. Don't want to disturb him right now. You know his mood before a premiere. Good luck then, we'll see each other later. Where are you headed? To the bathroom. You surely know the bathrooms aren't in this direction. Don't tell anyone. I wanted tosee the show from upstairs, fromthe cupola. [softly] Follow me. [orchestral instruments] [applause] [whispering] Now. [classical music playing] Are you sure that is the right way? Absolutely sure. I can do the rest on my own .. You can't be late. Good to see you, Feli. What are you doing here? I know I haven't been there foryou, but this changes now. How did you know I was up here? I want to help you. This might be your last chance to escape. Sorry, but I don't have time right now .. [strictly] You don't understand. All this is not real. Titus, you are hurting me. Listen to me! You have trapped yourself in your subconscious mind! To protect yourself. [bass noise] But soon you won't be able to wake up! Do you hear yourself talking? The fight with Dr. Jung .. .. Natascha being shot .. .. you being in that church. These are all situations you cannot deal with. Dr. Jung is not the enemy. And it wasn't Natascha .. Gai has been shot. [whispering] What? Do you understand? You are still with Dr. Jung. Onhis couch. It's hard to believe, I know. But how could I possibly know all this? Take the pills. Please. Please. If you are really a part of me .. .. then you also know what's written on the picture. What? Tell me. Tell me! Take the pills. [applause downstairs] [yelling] Take your hands off me! Damned. [orchestral music playing] [breathless] Feli! [applause downstairs] You made it. Holy shit. I know it's hard to believe .. .. but it seems like you know more than I expected. So YOU wanted me to have the picture. Then tell me .. why am I here? I've been looking for times andplaces where we could meet .. [strictly] .. because I needed to warn you! So I can really jump through time. Yes. I am the Feli that you once were. [exhausted] There is no time totell you everything, I'm here way too long already. There's no need to! Tell me how it works and you canreturn immediately. I just want to get Natascha outof there. [strictly] No! That's exactly why I am here. I don't know how many times I already tried that, but they have .. .. always caught me .. us .. Andthey will never stop to hunt us. Please, don't make the same mistakes that I made. Escape as long as they don't know that you know the truth. [sobbing] I can't when they still have Natascha. Because of me she is wounded, ormaybe even dead. [whispering] What? Shit. That's not the way I planned it. Why aren't you going back to prevent that they find us .. .. you have that power! Believe me, I would love to. But I would not survive the jumpback afterwards. I will even die if I stay heremuch longer .. and you will diewith me! But I need to get her out of there, why don't you understand?! I've let her down and I never believed her. [strictly] So please .. PLEASE .. tell me how it works! I understand you better than anyone else .. .. believe me. But changing the course of timecould kill us! If you finally want to live anormal life .. you need to run! Others succeeded as well, Christina made it to Capetown .. And Gai went to her aunt in Bangkok .. Gai?! [sobbing] Gai was one of us? I have feared they would have taken all memories from your past, but .. Gai is dead. Fuck! How? They killed her when she tried to give me the clue to the picture. Whom did you tell about her? No one .. but .. But whom, Feli? Whom? Leave her alone! Get lost! [strictly] Fuck off, Titus, you've created enough of a messalready. If she does not return to herown time immediately .. then youwill die! And? Since when do you care? You knew what they were doing and lied into my face all the time. I only wanted to protect you. Just leave me alone once and forall. I love you! Everything I did was just for you. I don't want to hear that anymore! Feli, they'll be here any minute- and then I can't help you anymore. Please, come with me. [shouting] GET LOST AT LAST! Leave me alone. Tell me! There they are! Tell me how to do it! Adrenaline. Focus, concentrate and gather all your .. Shut up and leave! .. gather your emotions and focus a certain point in time. Then just let it happen. Believe in yourself. You have that power! [screaming] No! [swooph] Show me your hands - and get away from the edge! [groans] [groans] [echoes] Believe in yourself. You have that power. You can do that. Concentrate!! [swooph] [traffic sound] [swooph] [swooph] [traffic noise] Aaaah! [swooph] [swooph] [moaning] [clank] [gun falling] [moaning] Aaaaah! [applause] [clank - Aaaaah!] [panting] Aaaah - ooh! [swooph] [crowd chatter] [swooph] [screams] [swooph] [groans] [squealing tires] [beep-beep] [mobile buzzes] Hello? [mobile phone] Felicitas. Who are you? You know that already. I'd rather like to know .. are you "you" again? What do you want? I'd like to help you. So you don't have to let down your best friend once more. We were not using live ammunition. She was just intoxicated. Take a look at your phone. [buzzing] You have two options now. Either you run - and leave yourfriend behind. Or you can reclaim your old life. And what do you want in return? Your life at my conditions. And Natascha will be released. You know where to find us. [engine starts] [whispering] Oh God. What did you do to her? Me? Nothing. I've always been looking after you. Your whole life. As if you would have been my owndaughters. That's why I knew you would be coming. After all I've been knowing youlong enough. [chuckles] And you are even morecurious than her. Nothing would have happened to her where she was. Until you showed up. Bullshit. You've made a jump. And you have no idea what happened to you. Or what could happen the next time you're trying to do it. Maybe you would succeed. Maybe even ten more times. Or you would suffer from a brainimpact right away. [softly] Believe me. You haven't been the first one Ihad to rescue. How many of us are out there? The gift is fading. Just like her your potential isenormous .. .. you must not waste it. And that is empowering you .. .. to take our memories? To treat us like slaves you canexamine anytime you want .. .. making us time-jump forscience, without caring for theconsequences? [scoffs] Ah, Felicitas .. You keep on attending your therapy sessions .. .. and we get what we need. You get your university degree .. .. might get married one day .. [chuckles] .. just a normal life. As it used to be. As it used to be. How can you possibly have a normal happy life .. .. if you know that you are different? That something is very wrong with you? I can't lie to myself anymore. And there's no way I will trustyou. I want to have my life in my ownhands. I have never asked for these powers. I have given everything .. .. to understand your powers. And you don't want them? [shouting] You don't want them?! Here. Take a close look. Half of my body looks like that. The fire caught us by surprise in our sleep. My wife. My sons. And that's why I keep on researching, every single day. And I will not stop .. .. until I fully understood yourpowers. And one day I will undo everything! Even if it is the last thing I'll ever do. You want your life back? Then help me to get mine back aswell! [softly] And? I am truly sorry for your family. But nothing on earth .. .. justifies what you are doingto us. Never. NEVER. How one can be deceived. NO! [swooph] NOOOOO! Watch out! [tense music playing] [swooph] [groans] [swooph] - Shit! [swooph] [swooph] [swooph] - Aaaaaaah! [clink] [swooph - swooph] [swooph - groans] Did you really think .. I would show up unprepared? Did you think our research .. .. never produced any results for decades? You might be able to control itin a certain way. But we can stop it from happening. You know .. .. whatever you think of me .. .. harming you was the last thing I ever wanted. Very clever. Very very clever. You might be able to control your past .. .. but without your memories .. [weak] No. .. that power is worthless. [stuttering] What happened? Everything is fine. You just fainted. [breathless whispering] Tascha .. Tascha. Tascha, please! Who are you? Felicitas. Your best friend. She needs help. Please, look around you. You need to remember! I never believed you, but you were right. With everything. I don't know what you are talking about. Enough. Tascha, please! [mysterious sound] Who are you? Me? Who are you? After all you are standing in myliving room. How are you, sweetheart? Still your old self. [desperately] No .. no .. nooo! NO! [sobbing] Feli? Feli? You keep surprising me. But this is definitely over now. You will for sure not ruin my life's work. Noooo! NO! NO! There is no need to try. [scoffs] Once your powers are back you won't need them anymore. Do you really want to try? Do you think you would be fasterthan me? I have already been. No. [whispering] No. [heroic music playing] [clink] [sobbing] Oh god .. [softly] What happend? What happened? Are you alright? Sure. What about you? Thank you. You should be going. He might have called for backupearlier. Come on. I will be missing you, sweetheart. [uplifting music playing] Where are we going? Where did you always want to go? [softly] I don't know. [bang - squealing tires] [dramatic music playing] [bass noise] [heartbeat] [groans] Aah. [panting] Natascha, we need to get out of here. Leave me behind. [strictly] No way. Come on! Get up! Pull yourself together, please! [groans] [both panting] Watch your head. Okay, listen. Stay here, I'll find us a way out. I'll be right back. Fuck! [groans heavily] [sobs desperately] [woman over PA] Mrs. Peters. My name is Andrea Pierce, head of security .. .. of Ingenium Industries. An organization specialized in saving women like you. You have been disrespected by our German contractors .. .. and I feel personallyresponsible and deeply sorry forthat, I am here today to offer you a second chance. Come over here. Talk to her. [indistinct shrieking] [bass sound] [strictly trembling voice] You need me. Let her go. Or I will kill myself. We do need you. But you are not going to do that. How can you be so sure? Your abilities are there to protect you. To ensure your survival. Trust me. I know. Nature made you like this. You won't kill yourself. It's not in your blood. [trembling] I don't know anymorewhat's in me and what is not. But I know that you will never abuse Natascha again. Release her or I'm dead. There is no escape from here. There never was. This is your destiny. Now .. .. accept your fate, or you bothdie. What do you say? I say .. .. fuck destiny! As you wish. Aaaaaaaaah! [dramatic music playing] [exhales] [end credits music playing]
