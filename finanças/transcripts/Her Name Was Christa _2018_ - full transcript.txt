(dramatic music) (growling) (upbeat music) (suspenseful music) - No, no, I'm sick of hearing it. I'm sick of hearing that she was just some prostitute. She was a human being! She was a person. She had a name. Her name was Christa. (suspenseful music) (people chatting) - Steve? It's Steve, right? - Yeah, Stephen. - Look, Steve, you gotta help me out, man. - Sure, what's going on? - Well, I've been working here three weeks now. During that time, with the exception of the wonderful training sessions I've endured, it's been like working in a monastery. I've got you on one side, I've got a wall on the other, and if I don't get some kind of conversation going on soon, I'm gonna lose my fucking mind! You know what I mean? - I'm sorry, I'm afraid I'm not much of a conversationalist. I tend to keep to myself. - Yet, you work at a telemarketing firm. Kooky. I'm Nick, by the way. Nick Perkins. - Oh, Stephen Booth, it's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you as well. So, how long have you been here? - Hmm, I'd say going on eight years now. - Eight years? - Mm-hmm. - Wow. You like it? - Yeah, yeah I do. - Why? - Well, it's stable, repetitive. I know what to expect, you know? No surprises. - Well, I can't argue with that, and that keeps you happy? - I mean, I make my bills. You know, I put a little in savings. I'm not out on the streets, and I don't hate my job like a lotta people do. I'd say that there are far worse people off than I am. - Yeah, and if that works for you, great. Me, on the other hand, if I'm still here after a year, do me a favor and shoot me in the fucking face. - Everything okay here? - Oh, yeah, Blaze, I was just giving the new guy some tips on paperwork, that's all. - New guy? - Oh sorry, sir. I'm Nick, Nick-- - Stephen, I wasn't even aware we promoted you to supervisor? - Oh, nothing like that. I'm just trying to help out, that's all. - Oh, well, we do appreciate that. Although, I gotta ask, is this gonna affect your ability to get me the transitional documents for the Alba project by close of business today? - No, I'm actually just putting the finishing touches on that right now. - Super duper. Well, I'll look forward to critiquing those later. Have a good day! - That guy is patient zero for AIDS. Fucked a monkey and shit. - He's not such a bad guy. He's got a lot on his plate. - What the fuck kinda name is Blaze anyway? It's like his mom shit him out and the best she could come up with was Blaze? No wonder why that dude's a dick donkey. He smells like one too. - I've met far worse. - I don't know how. Oh, you wanna grab lunch later? - Sure, yeah, we can do that. - Super duper. To be continued. (people chatting) So, if I don't rack up some sales pretty soon, I'm gonna be out on my ass. - It just takes a little time, you're fresh outta training. Sales will come. - I hope so, the only thing worse than having a job you hate is looking for a job you know you're gonna hate. - Well, it's not gonna come to that. You're not eating? - No, I'll grab something later. So, you married, man? - No, never been. - Girlfriend? - No. - You gay? - No, no, nothing like that. Just haven't met the right one yet, that's all. - When was the last time you been out with someone? Let me rephrase that, when was the last time you got laid? - Jesus, what kinda question is that? - It's a pretty direct one. When's the last time you got laid? - It's been quite awhile. - [Nick] Who was president? - I'm not getting into this with you. - Look, I'm just worried about you, man. - Well, you don't have to worry. I'm not looking to get laid. If I was gonna let somebody into my life I would want it to be something more real. - Where would you look for something like that? - I didn't say I was looking. - But if you were? (people chatting) - I signed up for a online dating service a couple months ago. - Oh geez. - [Stephen] What's wrong with that? - Try the bar. - I don't drink. - Of course, order a Coke. - I tend to stick out like a sore thumb in a bar. - I can definitely see that, but you're not gonna find what you're looking for on a dating site. Most of the people on there are just down to bone. Otherwise, there's a reason why they're in their 40s and still single. - I'm in my 40s and still single. - Yeah, we're not gonna talk about that. What about her? - I'm old enough to be her father. - There's grass on the field, play ball. (sighing) - I don't think so. - I get it, you just don't wanna knock out any baby teeth, that's cool. - Anybody ever tell you you're really foul? - All the time. (people chatting) Her. - Cathy, oh no, no. - [Nick] She too big for ya? - No, no, it's nothing like that, it's just... - Just what? - Work relationships very seldomly work out, and when they don't work out, things can get a little uncomfortable. - We gotta figure something out. - No, we really don't. - Sorry to say buddy, you rubbed the lamp, here I am. I'm on a mission. (people chatting) - Four years. - Hmm? - It's been four years since I've slept with someone. - Oh God, it's worse than I thought. - I shouldn't of said anything. - No, no, no, we just, we really need to address this ASAP. (dramatic music) - It's hard you know, I mean, you wake up one morning and you discover you're old. And, you discover you're overweight, and, you don't look like you used to. And you reach a point where it's like well, I'm on the wrong side of 40, and I'm alone. And I'm alone. And, I just didn't wanna be alone. (people chatting) - Hookers! - What? - We need to get you a hooker. - Keep your voice down. - Sorry, but it's perfect, it's the perfect answer. - I already told you, that's not what I'm looking for. - I realize that, but while you're out looking for the future Mrs. Booth, it might not be a bad idea to release some tadpoles. (scoffing) - You've gotta be kidding me. - Seriously, think about it, you're outta practice, might be wise to clean out your pipes. - I don't think that's gonna be a problem. - [Nick] How often are you jerking off? - [Stephen] Jesus, Nick. - I'm serious. - Now, that is none of your business. - Hey, mind your business. - Besides, I would never pay for sex, I'm not desperate. - Well, I got news for you pal, you're gonna pay for sex. We all do, think about it. You take a girl out on a date, dinner, movie, coffee, hours of her incessant babbling, then $75 later, you get a peck on the cheek. Second date, $75 later, you might get some tit action. Third date, $75 later, with a shit ton a luck, you're finally balls deep. But, with a hooker, you could cut through all the red tape. - And again, I told you, that's not what I'm looking for. - Okay, so let me put this to you in a way you might understand, what you're telling me is, it wouldn't be nice to be intimate with somebody for the first time in half a decade, why you continue to search for your soul mate? - I'm not saying that, it's just, isn't that kinda pathetic. - No more than being celibate against your will for the last four years. - Thanks. Look, even if I was gonna entertain this thought, I wouldn't know the first place to go to find a hooker. - The corner of Howard and Main. Not that I'd know anything about that, I just hear things. - Yeah, right. (sighing) Well, look, thank you, but, I don't think that's gonna be necessary. - You're call, but keep in mind at your age, it might not be a bad idea to make sure your equipment's still in working order. - Thanks, I'll keep that in mind. - Do that. (suspenseful music) (chatting) - Looking for some company tonight? - Yeah. - Mind if I get in? - Sure. So, how much do you charge? - You a cop? - No, no. - 'Cause you know if you're a cop, then you propositioned me, now that's entrapment. - No, I'm not a cop. - Very good. Well, for 20 bucks I'll jack you off. For 50 I'll suck your cock. And for 100, I'll fuck you so hard it'll knock the fillings right outta you're teeth. Which is good, 'cause my brother's an amateur dentist and can put 'em back in for you for another 100. - What's your name? - Raven, you? - Stephen. - Well, Mr. Stephen, what's it gonna be? - A hand job, I guess. - Wonderful. (sighing) Drive two more blocks and make a right, hot rod. - Don't you wanna go to a motel? - Are you seriously gonna pay for a motel for a fucking hand job? Just go where I said. All right, give me the 20. All right, well, pull out your dick. Come on, let's go! (car creaking) (suspenseful music) (sighing) Okay, what is the problem? - I don't know. - Oh geez, give me another 30. - Why? - I'm gonna blow you, genius, do the math. (suspenseful music) Okay, what's your fucking deal, dude? - I'm sorry, I just-- - What's it gonna take, a finger in the ass? 'Cause that's gonna cost more. - No, I-- - I'm not giving your money back, motherfucker. I did my job. - I didn't ask for my money back. - Well, good. So are we done here, or should I keep sucking on this thing? - I think we're done here. - Fine. Work with your problem, man. - Hey, what's up man, you haven't said two words all day. - I think I'm cursed. - [Nick] What are you talking about? - I took your advice. - What advice? Holy fuck, are you serious? What happened? - Nothing. - What do you mean nothing? - I mean, I picked up a young, attractive girl. I couldn't do it, I couldn't get it up. - I jinxed you, I totally jinxed you, I'm sorry, dude. You know I was just fucking with you when I was calling you old, right? - I know, I know, it's cool. It's not you. - Well, you know all that shit's in your head, right, it happens to the best of us. - Yeah. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, I got it. - What? - Have you ever heard of the Girlfriend Experience? - No. - Oh, it's pretty much when you pay a call girl to pretend to be your girlfriend, you take her out on dates, take her home, and get nice and cuddly and all that. It's usually reserved for socially awkward rich guys, or recently divorced people trying to get back into the dating game. But I'd say this situation applies. - I think I'm done with the whole hooker thing. - No, no, no, you don't understand, it's way past that now. It's obvious you got some deep-seated emotional issue in your brain to where you can't fuck unless you actually care about that person. It's just a matter of finding a way to break that mentality. - Wouldn't it be smarter for me to just see a doctor? - Did you fix the wick before you doo in the morning? - Yeah. - Then it's all in your head. - Maybe this is just my body's way of saying I should be alone for a little while. - You've been alone for awhile, do you like being alone? - No. - Maybe you should listen to me about this. - All right, I'll think about it. - Alright, think hard, no pun intended. (chuckling) - [Woman] But I think it's getting better. We are taking the initiative to, to become more connected in that way, in the physical act of love. But it's been an uphill climb. He is not a very good lover - Goddammit. - [Woman] anymore. (sighing) (dramatic music) (engine roaring) What the hell am I doing out here? - Hey old man. You gonna be my daddy tonight? (tires squealing) Hey, what the hell? Asshole. * Always go * Always go * Always go - [Woman] Hey, you got a light? (upbeat music) - She was the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my entire life. She was like this vision. You know, you know how you see someone, and you just immediately know that physically they're everything you've ever desired? That was Christa. - Do you got a light? - I'm sorry, I don't smoke. - Well, that's pretty much how my whole night's gone, thanks anyway. - You wanna talk about it? - You know I'm out here working, right? - I kinda figured. - Thanks for the offer but, I don't need a psychiatrist, I need a client. - We could talk about that too. - You looking for a date? - Yeah, but, I'd also like to offer you a proposal. - What kinda proposal? You're not some weird religious freak, are you? - No, no, nothing like that. - Uh-huh. - Look, why don't we go inside, I'll buy you a cup of coffee, maybe get something to eat, and we'll talk about it. If you don't like what I have to say, you can leave and chock it up as a free meal, sound good? - All right. - Great, what's your name? - Candy. - Short for Candace? - No, regular for Candy. - Well, my name's Stephen, it's nice to meet you. - Likewise. Didn't you just come from the diner? - [Stephen] Mm-hmm. - [Candy] Okay. - Hi, what can I get the two of you to drink tonight? - Coffee, please. - I'll have a diet Coke, please. - All right, I'll have those right out for you, now, will you guys be eating? - I think we're gonna need a minute to decide. - Not a problem, just let me know, and I'll be right back with your drinks. - Thank you. So what were you upset about earlier? - Oh, it's nothing really. It's one of the girls that works in the area, she got beat up by one of her regulars. She's going to be okay, it's just unnerving. - That's understandable, does that happen often? - No, rarely, that's why it's so shocking. But, I don't wanna talk about that. I believe that you had a proposition for me? - Straight to the point, huh? - Well, that's why I'm here. - Okay. Have you ever done any acting before? (scoffing) - No, I don't do porn, and I won't be videotaped. So if that's what this is about-- - No, no, nothing like that. (scoffing) - I did some acting in high school, plays and stuff, why? - Have you ever heard of the Girlfriend Experience? - Yes. - That's what I'm looking for. - Stephen, what do you do for a living? - [Stephen] I'm in sales. - What kinda sales? - Telesales. (scoffing) - You can't afford me. - Let me worry about that. Look, I'm not rich. But, over the years I've been able to put aside a pretty good nest egg. I think I can handle it. - Okay, so what were you thinking? - What do you mean? - I mean, how many nights a week do you want a girlfriend? - You know, I hadn't really thought about that. I'd say two to start with. - Overnights? - [Stephen] No, no, not to start with. - How many hours a night? - Four. - So, basically, you pick me up, we go, dinner, dancing, mini golf, we go back to your place, we fuck, and then you drop me off? - No, no, we won't be sleeping together, at least not at first. - You're going to pay me to take me on dates and there'll be no physical contact? - Well, I mean, I'd like to hold your hand. Hug, cuddle maybe. - But that's it? - Yeah. - [Waitress] Here you are, doll. Did you decide whether or not you're eating? - Yeah, I think I'd like to order something. How about you, Stephen? - Yeah, yeah, I could eat. - Okay, my time is worth something, but, since we won't be having sex, I can cut you a break on the price. - Okay, what do you think would be fair? - I think for two nights a week, maximum four hours a night, it'll be $200. - Okay, so, $100 a night, I can do that. - That, and you pay everywhere we go. - Absolutely. - Now, once we start talking sex and overnights, those rates do not apply. - [Stephen] That makes sense. What do you think then? - I think that sex with a maximum four hour date night is gonna be an additional $150. - Okay, how about overnights? - Well, that's a tough one. That means I'm outta commission for the whole night except for you. I'm thinking $500. That gives you and me until at the most 9:00 a.m. With a maximum of us fucking three times. I know that's a lotta money, but, I think you'll find I'm worth it. You'll know where your money went. Can you afford that? - Yes, yeah, I can swing that. - Good. Now, I think we should set some boundaries. - Boundaries? - Yeah, basically, a list of rules of things that are acceptable in our arrangement. - You know, I'm really starting to think that you missed your calling as an attorney. (chuckling) - Trust me, this is to protect you and me both. - Okay. So what are your boundaries? - Well, first of all, we will never have sex without a condom. Under no circumstance will you be coming in me or on me. - Okay, that makes sense. What else? - Under no circumstance will you ever know where I live. At the end of our dates, our when the time comes on our overnights, you will bring me back here, to this diner, drop me off, and leave. If you ever follow me home, deal's off. - No problem. - Don't test me on this one, Stephen. You seem really sweet, but, if you stalk me, I know some mean motherfuckers who will put you someplace no one will ever find you again. - Don't worry, Candy, I'll respect your privacy. - Good. Finally, we will be doing nothing that involves blood, piss, shit, vomit, choking, or any other weird sex shit. Just straight sex. And if you wanna bring someone else in, it's gonna cost extra. - You don't have anything to worry about with that, I have no interest in any of that. - Good. What about you? - [Stephen] What about me, what? - What are your boundaries? - Oh, (sighing) okay. I understand that you're gonna have to continue working when we're not together, I get that. But I don't wanna hear anything about you and another client, or anything about you with a previous situation with a client. - Okay, I can do that. - See, that's where it gets a little difficult. I mean, if this fake relationship is gonna work, we need to be able to communicate. Are you gonna be able to have a conversation without bringing up your line of work? - You have nothing to worry about. I love to talk. And in fact, you'll probably get tired of hearing me. - I hardly doubt that. - Anything else? - No, no, not that I can think of. - Well, we can always add to it later. There is just one more thing. - Okay, go ahead, what's up? - Basically, you're paying me to go on dates with you, right? - Yes. - Wouldn't this be considered a date? I mean, we are talking, and having dinner. - You got me there. - So, I believe you owe me $100. - Oh, so that's how it is, huh? - These are your rules. - Well, I believe my rules also states that a date is four hours. We've only been here maybe an hour and a half. - I guess we'll just have to find something to do with ourselves for the next two and a half hours then. - You really wanna do this? - Yeah, I'm game, what should we do? - [Stephen] I have an idea. - What's that? - It's a surprise. - Stephen, I don't like surprises. - Trust me. (suspenseful music) - Okay. Why are we out here? - I like to come here and get my thoughts together and relax. This is a peaceful place for me. - Are you a fucking serial killer, Stephen? - No. Why would you say that? - Look, I'm gonna be very calm when I say this, but I have a loaded Smith and Wesson in my purse that I know how to use. So if you're thinking of cutting me up and leaving me out here, I'd get that thought right outta your head. - Jesus, Candy, no, nothing like that at all. It's a nice night. I just thought that we'd go out, lay on blanket, watch the stars. If we're lucky, we might even get to see a plane land. - Okay, but I'm only doing this because I'm pretty sure I can kick your ass. - Where I don't doubt that, if this is gonna work you're gonna have to learn to trust me. - And, while that makes sense, I just met you two hours ago. You have to understand my hesitation. (sighing) - You're right, I hadn't even thought about that. - Girl can't be too careful. - I'm sorry. I promise you that my intentions are absolutely in no way bad. - Okay, let's do this. (suspenseful music) - Come join me. - In my line a work, this would be considered a no no. It really is beautiful out here, though. - I know, right. - So how do you wanna do this? - I seriously have no idea, I've never done this before. - Okay, so, what do you wanna know? We can have a relationship speed dating round. - Okay, what's your favorite color? - Blue, what's yours? - Red, do you have any pets? (giggling) - No, I have enough trouble just taking care of myself. - I don't have any pets either. What do you like to do for fun? - I really like loud music, I like movies. I'm not much of a sports person. - Yeah, I'm not into sports either. Do you have a favorite band? - I really like The Velvet Underground and Nico. What about you? - I like Hall and Oats. - Really? They're kinda corny. - So am I. - Yeah, you're kind of a goof. - Thanks. Do you have a favorite movie? - "Pretty Woman." - Seriously? (laughing) - No, I'm just fucking with you, it's "JFK." I'm kind of a conspiracy theory buff. What about you? - "Jaws," completely freaked me out as a kid. - Me too. - Who's your favorite actor? - Johnny Depp. - Of course. - Why do you say that? - All women love Johnny Depp. - He's a talented actor. - Yeah, and I'm sure it has absolutely nothing to do with the way he looks. - Well, it doesn't hurt, what about you? - Oh, Mel Gibson. - Really? Even after that whole Jew hating thing? And the fucked up calls he made to his ex-girlfriend? - I'm not saying I condone any of that, but, the guy was Martin Riggs, William Wallace, and Mad Max, I gotta cut the guy a little bit a slack, you know? So what's your last name? - [Candy] I'm not going to tell you that. - Is Candy your real name? - I'm not going to tell you that either. - Okay. Were you born here? - No, I'm originally from Florida. - Oh, what part? - Jacksonville. - Nice. How did you end up in Ohio? - I got married when I was in my 20s. My ex-husband was from Ashland, and he convinced me to move up here. - How long were you married? - Four years. - What happened, if you don't mind me asking? (soft music) - He was an alcoholic, he was abusive. One day I just had enough. I packed a bag and never looked back. - I'm sorry. - Don't be, I'm a big girl, I made my own decisions. - Why didn't you just go back to Jacksonville? - I didn't have any family or friends left there, I figured there was no reason to go back. - Is that how you became a call girl? - I thought you didn't wanna talk about that? - It's okay, I wanna know. - Kind of, I was a dancer. Some of the girls I worked with, they were making serious bank hooking on the side. I just kinda fell into it. What about you, you ever been married? - Once, almost. - What happened, she cheat on you? - No, no, nothing like that, actually, she died. - I'm so sorry. - It's okay. - What happened? - Well, she was walking home from work, I was supposed to pick her up, but, I got delayed. While she was walking, this drunk driver came outta nowhere, and hopped the curb and hit her. They say she died instantly, she wasn't in any pain or anything. But, they never caught the guy. - I'm so sorry, Stephen. - Thank you. It sucks, I mean, when you think your life is gonna go a certain way, and then something comes along that can just change that in an instant. - Yeah. I can understand that. - I mean, it's just like any other relationship, you know, you go into it not really knowing each other and you have to build levels of trust. You have to figure out, okay, what is it that this person needs? What is it that this person needs to make them happy? And, if you can find a common ground on that, you can build. You can build, and you can, you can really make something special. I really, really enjoyed spending time with you tonight, thank you. - I actually had a really good time as well, when did you wanna meet next? - You available Saturday? - Nine, here? - I'll look forward to it. - Me too. - Are you sure I can't give you a ride home? - You know the rules, besides, I can take care of myself. Thank you, though. - No problem. See you on Saturday. (people chatting) I wanna thank you by the way. - For what? - I took your advice, I gave things another chance with the Girlfriend Experience. - Oh nice, what's she like? - She's amazing, she's absolutely beautiful. Smart, funny, and I could talk to her for hours. - Oh, that's cool man, nice tits? - Come on, man. Yes, she has an amazing body. - Sounds like you won the lotto with this one. So, is she a beast in the sack? - No, it's not like that, we're not sleeping together. - What the fuck are you paying her for then? - Companionship. I told you before that's not what I'm looking for. I'm not saying it couldn't happen in the future, don't get me wrong. But, right now, I'm just enjoying getting to know her. - And you pay for that? - Yeah. - A little weird, man. (chuckling) What's her name? - Candy. - Ooh, Candy, that's nice, that's original, that's tasty. Sure you're gonna let me know when you make those cheeks sticky, right? - Oh yeah, you'll be the first to know. - Don't forget to wear your rubber jammies. (chuckling) By the way, who's your tailor? (laughing) (horn honking) - You weren't waiting long, were you? - No, not at all. How was your day? - It was good, how about you? - Nothing exciting, it's good to see you. - It's good to see you too. So, what would you like to do tonight? - I have an idea. - Okay, what were you thinking? (dramatic music) (screaming) A haunted house, seriously? - Yeah, what's the problem? You don't like being scared? - Not particularly, no. In fact, I'd say I've spent a good portion of my life trying to avoid scary situations. - That's gonna change tonight. - Oh, excuse me. - You know I'm willing to take you anywhere you wanna go, right? - I know, and I wanna go to Ghoul Brothers. - Aren't we a little old to be standing in this line? - Maybe you are. - Hey now. - Besides, I would hardly call the best haunted attraction in all of Northeast Ohio a haunted house. - You sound like an advertisement for the place, what do they got you on payroll? - No, but, I do know the owner. Not like that. - I didn't ask. - Next. - Hey Jack, how's business tonight? - Candy, back for more I see. And you brought a date with you this time. So, are you ready to be frightened beyond your most horrifying nightmares? To see things no mortal man can ever see? Can your heart stand what lies within these cursed walls? - Sure. - Now that's what I like to hear. And that'll be $34, please. - Alive, alive, alive. These are all creatures of God, ladies and gentlemen, not men, they are authentic. And they are alive, alive, alive. I hope your insurance is paid up, pal. (laughing) (dramatic music) (growling) (yelling) (growling) (upbeat music) (growling) - [Stephen] I actually had a really, really good time tonight. - I'm glad you got to live a little. (Stephen chuckling) Nice place. - Thank you. - You been here long? - I've owned the place about 15 years, but, this was actually my childhood home. My parents left it to me when they passed away. - Oh. Well, we have about an hour left, anything you wanna do? - You wanna just watch some TV? - Is this where the cuddling comes in? - Yeah. - Okay, we can do that. (talking on TV) - This is nice. - Yeah. - Candy, can I ask you something? - Sure. (soft music) - What did you think of me when we first met? - I thought you were very handsome, I thought you had nice eyes, and I thought you were gay. - Seriously? - Yeah! You have a bit of a effeminate quality. It's not a bad thing, it's just, you're sensitive, and well mannered, you don't see that a lot. Especially not on Howard Street. - Yeah. - What did you think of me? - I thought you were beautiful, I thought you were strong. You really seemed in control. - Was that off putting? - No, no, not at all.

(clearing throat) - Took a couple of days off, figured I deserved it. - What's going on with you? - What do you mean? - You look different, you look happy. - Well, I am happy, is that so bad? - Motherfucker, you got laid. (chuckling) - No, but, I can definitely say that I found what I've been missing. - So I take it things are working out with you and Candy? - Oh yeah, definitely. - That's all great and fun, but, don't forget, this is a business transaction, don't get too attached. It's not love. - Why do you gotta come at me like that, Nick? I'm aware of what this is. You know, this is the first time in years I get up in the morning and I'm actually happy to be alive, that I'm not just walking through the motions of life. Is that such a bad thing? - You know what? You right, you're absolutely right. I'm just worried about you, man. You're a big boy, you know what you're doing. And, for what it's worth, I'm actually glad to see you happy. - Thank you, I appreciate that. - No sweat off these balls, pal. (insects trilling) - So, I wanted to talk to you about something. - Sure, what's up? - How would you feel about spending the night tonight? - I'm all for it. You remember our arrangement, right? - Yes, I actually stopped at the ATM earlier, just in case you said yes. - Well, then, you were smart because I'm saying yes. - So, where's my money, honey? - Oh, I got it right here. Let's see here. 100, 200, 300, $400. - Thank you. So, what'd you wanna do tonight? - Anything you wanna do. - You wanna go to bed? - Sure. - Okay, why don't you go up, make yourself comfortable, I'm gonna use the bathroom. - Okay. Oh my God. You look amazing. - Do you like it? - Oh, yeah. - Mind if I get into bed with you? - Not at all, I'd like that a lot. No, sweet dreams baby doll. (sighing) What are you doing? - You don't think I dress like this every night to go to bed, do you? - No, I just... - Well, come on baby, fuck me. (dramatic music) - Candy. Candy, not now. - Yes, now. - [Raven] What fuck is your problem? - Candy, stop. - What's the problem, I thought you said I looked incredible? - You do. - Then what is it? Don't you want me? - Very much so. - Is it because I'm a prostitute? - No, that has nothing to do with it. Come here. (sighing) Look, I don't care about that. And I certainly don't judge you for it. As far as I'm concerned, you've done the things that you've done in order to survive. But at the end of the day, I think you're wonderful. I swear to you, that has absolutely nothing to do with it. - What is it then? Why'd you have me stay the night? - I just wanted to hold you, is that so bad? Candy, of course I wanna sleep with you. I mean, who wouldn't? You're smart, you're beautiful, you're everything anyone could ever possibly want. And I love our time together, I sincerely do. I'm just not ready to go there just yet. All I want tonight is to just hold you in my arms, and pretend the rest of the world doesn't exist. Can you understand that? - No. No, not really. - Can you try? - Just so I'm understanding, you're willing to pay me $500 to hold me while we sleep? - Yes, that's all I want. - Are you sure you're not gay? - Yes, I'm sure I'm not gay. - Okay, if that's what you want. - Thank you. Thank you. (sighing) Goodnight, sweetheart. - Goodnight. (suspenseful music) - A two week vacation, now, with the Rodriguez account coming up? I'm sorry Stephen, but that's just outta the question. - I haven't taken a vacation in the eight years that I've worked here, the come on owes me two weeks pay. - And while that might be true, now is just not a good time. We need you here. Besides, I've been looking at your timecards, and you sure have been missing an awful lotta work lately. - I earn eight personal paid days per year. Every single one of those days off was approved by a supervisor. - Yeah, and you've used all eight of them in the last three months. - I don't wanna fight with you, I need this time off. - And I'm real sorry about that, but I just don't see how that's a possibility right now. - What about my raise? - Stephen, the company is in a transitional period. That means all raises have been temporarily suspended until further notice. - According to the company handbook, I'm to receive a raise every year and a half as long as my numbers are good, my numbers are spotless. - Stephen, what has gotten into you? You never used to be like this. What do you need all this vacation time for? - I met somebody, okay? I just need a little time off so I can take her on a trip, that's all. - Stephen, I had no idea. Look, my hands are tied about the raise. But, if you're willing to be patient, maybe I can talk to upper management about getting your vacation time approved. - Are you serious? That would be great, thank you. - Yeah, I just need you to sign this. - What's this? - Simply states that you understand that the company needs a little more time to tie up loose ends, and you're willing to wait on your pay increase. - And if I sign this, I'll be able to have my vacation time? - Shouldn't be a problem. (slurping) Very good. I'll get back to you. (talking on TV) - So, I was talking to my boss today. - Oh yeah? - I wanna bounce an idea off ya, and see what you thought? - Okay, what's up? - When was the last time you went on a vacation? - Oh, wow, it's been 10 years at least. Back in 2009 some girlfriends and I went to Cancun, we had a blast. - That sounds nice. The reason I ask is, I've got some vacation time saved up. - Oh, yeah, it's totally cool. Go, enjoy your vacation and we can hook back up when you get home. - That's not what I'm getting at. I want you to come with me, I want it to be our vacation. - Are you serious? - Yeah, I really want you to go. - I don't know, Stephen. That's kind of a big step. - I know it is, and I'm not trying to put you on the spot. I'd really like to spend some more time with you, and, I think this would be a really great opportunity to do just that. - Can I ask you something? - Sure, what's up? - Did you mean what you said the other night when I stayed over? - What's that? - That you understand why I became a call girl and you didn't judge me for it? - Absolutely. Candy, I could never think anything bad about you. - Well, I'd be an idiot to turn down a free vacation. And, I can't think of anyone I'd rather go with. Yes, let's do it. - Fantastic. So, where do you wanna go? - I don't know, you pick. - Mm-mm, no, no, I want this to be our vacation, I think we both should decide. - Well, I'd like to think about it for a bit then. - No problem. Oh, also, I aware we're gonna have to come up with some other kinda payment plan. - Oh, what do you mean? - Well, I mean, depending on where we go, that's gonna be a lot of overnights, I have some money saved up for the trip, but, we may have to break the time up a little bit, that's all. - Stephen, depending on where we go, you're already shelling out a ton a money. I don't wanna take advantage. - Well, we'll figure it out. I'm just really, really glad that you're coming with me. (sighing) - I've literally done nothing all day. (chuckling) - Well Stephen, when it rains it pours, I'm afraid. - What do you mean? - I just got off the phone with the head office, they are not improving your vacation time. It sucks, I know. Just get with me in a couple a months, I'll see what I can do. - You told me this wasn't going to be a problem, that you'd take care of it. I've already started making plans. - No, what I told you was, I could talk to upper management. Which, I did. It's a tough break, but we're gonna get it to you. It's gonna be a little longer than you expected. I really need you to be a team player on this for me, Stephen. All right, well, thanks for understanding. - Fuck you. - Excuse me, what the fuck did you just say to me? - I said, fuck you! I've been at this job eight years, I'm never late, I don't call off, I bust my ass for this job. And you know what the thanks I get? Being dicked around by some wormy piece a shit like you. Somebody who I'm sure upper management would have no problem approving a raise, or any type of vacation time. Well, no more. No, I'm gonna say fuck you, Blaze. And you're lucky I don't smash your fucking teeth down your fucking throat! - You just made a huge mistake. - My mistake was believing word out of your fucking mouth. - Fuck, man. (coughing) - Fuck, man! - Why the fuck do you smoke these things? - What the hell's gotten into you? - Honestly? - [Woman] Thanks, asshole. - You. - Well. It's been fun. So what are you gonna do about money? - I got a little in savings, after that, I guess we'll see. - I like this new you. - I do too. - Mr. Booth, we need you to come with us. - Kinda figured. - And don't even think about lighting another cigarette. You know there's not smoking on the sales floor. - Am I fired? - Oh, I think you know you are. - Then what the fuck are you gonna do about it? - [Security] Leave all your things, right this way. - Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, motherfucker! Fuck! (breathing hard) (engine roaring) We need to talk. - Sure, what's up? - Can I get you something to drink? - No, I'm okay. What's going on? - I can't see you anymore. - What, why? - I'm sorry, I just can't see you anymore. - What did I do wrong? What about our trip? - Candy, you didn't do anything wrong. You know I love our time together. And I was really genuinely looking forward to this trip. I mean, it means the world to me. - Then what is it? Why are you throwing me away? - I lost my job today. I have a little bit of money saved up, but, it's not gonna last. Maybe we can start back up in a couple a months. - I'm sorry you lost your job, but, is that all? - Maybe you don't understand, this is killing me! I want to be with you but I have no money. At least not enough to pay you and still survive. - It doesn't matter. - Well it matters to me! - Stephen. - What? (dramatic music) What are you doing? - I love you. - Candy, I don't have any money, you can stop the act now. - It's no act. - I don't understand. - My real name is Christa Sullivan. I live at 547 Hillman Avenue in Akron. I haven't seen a client other than you for a month and a half now. You know the diner that you pick me up and drop me off at? I've been working there for two months as a waitress. I don't make anywhere near what I used to, but, I get by. And, at the end of the day, I have my self-respect. You are without a doubt, the kindest, sexiest, most wonderful man I've ever met. And I'm madly in love with you. Here. - What's this? - Open it. It's $1700. I know it's not everything you ever paid me, but, it's a start, and, I'll pay the rest back. You have to understand that before I met you I believed all people were scum, especially men. I had to learn to use my body, my looks, and my lies to get what I wanted from them. It didn't matter because I knew I was better than they were. My number one rule was trust no one. And then you came into my life. I never met anyone like you. I can't imagine what my life would be like without you. And I don't want to. I bared my soul to you, my question is, how do you feel about me? - I love you too. With all my heart. - Stephen. - Yeah? - You wanna go get naked? - Yeah, yeah, I'd like that. Wait. I don't have any condoms. - I've been tested and I'm okay with it if you are. - There's something else I need to talk to you about. - What? - I haven't been with a woman in many years. I'm not even sure if I can physically. - Don't worry about it. - I just don't wanna disappoint you. - You never could. Hey Stephen? - Yeah? - I don't think that's going to be a problem. - Yeah, I know, I guess not. - I'm gonna use the restroom, but I need you to go make yourself comfortable on the bed, and I'll meet you in there. - Okay. - Don't start without me. - Promise. When somebody that wonderful, and somebody you care about that much, let's you know that they feel exactly the same about you, (sniffing) there's no better feeling. (sighing) (soft music) (dramatic music) (gasping) Christa! Christa, is everything okay? No, no, no! (dramatic music) (crying) No. Why Christa, why? We were supposed to have a future together. I just wanted to make you happy. I don't understand. I coulda been there for you. (crying) - What was I supposed to say, Stephen? That I'm a junkie? You already had to forgive me for being a whore. There's only so much one person can handle. - You know I never judged you. I could have been there for you. I coulda gotten you help. We coulda fought this thing together. - I was trying, I was trying to get my life back so we could be happy. I knew I loved you, but I had no idea how you thought about me. - Well, what the hell am I supposed to do now? How am I supposed to go on without you? - You're not, I'm here, I'm not going anywhere. I meant what I said. I love you, I'll never leave you. - But you're dead. - Do I look dead to you? - No. - Then what are you worried about? - Am I crazy? - Who isn't? - I'm serious! Have I lost my mind? - Do you honestly love me Stephen? Honestly with all of your being? - Christa, you know I do. - Then stop fighting this. Just, stop asking questions and come to bed. Please. I want you so bad, baby, I need you. And I think you need me too. - But, you're dead. - I said stop asking questions, baby. Don't you want me? Do you find me attractive? - More than anyone on the planet. - Then make love to me, please. Show me how much you love me. - This is insane. - Come here. Come here. You're right, baby, I am dead. But I've been dead a long time. It was your love and your kindness, that brought me back to life. Now, we can concentrate on the negative, or we can just be happy that we found each other. You want that, don't you? - Very much so. - Then make love to me, please. I've waited so long. - Is that really what you want? - Yes, I wanna show you how much I care, please. (soft music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (birds chirping) - Good morning, tiger. - Mm, good morning. - How'd you sleep? - Good, how about you? - You were incredible last night. (chuckling) - Thank you, you were pretty stellar yourself. - What were your plans for today? - Well, I don't have to go to work anymore. Is there someplace you wanted to go? - Baby, I'm dead, I'm not going anywhere. Stephen, you're going to have to make your peace with us. - It's kind of a tall order. - Look, you asked me last night if you were crazy. I'd say having a conversation with your dead soulmate would be a pretty good indicator. And honestly, for someone talking to a corpse, you don't seem all that shaken up. - I'm aware. I guess, I just was so happy to have you back, I didn't care how. I just knew I needed you with me. - The way I see it, you have two options, you can call the police, tell them that a known prostitute OD'd in your bathroom, they'll come, they'll take me away and bury me, and we'll never see each other again. Or two, you can embrace the fact that we've been given a second chance, we can be together. Even if you are crazy, doesn't it kinda work out to our advantage? - I don't know, I mean, isn't there some kinda morality issue we should be thinking about here? - Stephen, you spent the night fucking my dead body. I think it's a little late to be considering morality. - Well, first of all, I didn't fuck you. I made love to you. - While that's very true, it doesn't change the fact, I'm still quite dead. Stephen, I don't wanna leave. I don't wanna be buried. I wanna be with you. You said you loved me, doesn't that mean anything? - Of course it does. It's just that-- - It's just nothing. Stephen, don't fucking take me. Promise me you won't let them take me. - You're right, you're absolutely right. Christa, I promise, I'll never let them take you. - Thank you baby, you mean the world to me. I hope you know that. - I know how that sounds, but it's the truth. We were able to make things work. We beat the odds, we beat the odds. (sniffing) Love conquers all. Sometimes even death. - Can you do me a favor and run to the store tomorrow? Pick up some air freshener. I'm worried I'm starting to smell bad. - You don't smell bad. - I don't believe you, you have to say that. - I wouldn't lie to you, besides, I like the way you smell. - Just humor me, please? - All right, I certainly wouldn't want any self-conscious corpse bride, now would I? - Ha ha, very funny. Now get your sexy ass up here, I have plans for tonight. - Oh, do you now? - I do. I'm so glad I found you. - Me too, sexy. - Swear you'll never leave me? - I swear. (whimsical music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) Fuck. (vomiting) - Everything's okay, come back to bed. - Again, I can't explain it, I don't understand it. I don't care. I don't give a fuck, I don't care. If it means that we can be together, I don't care. (knocking) Hi, Mrs. Jackson, everything okay? - I hate to bother you sweetie. And it's a bit embarrassing, but, would you have time to talk to me? - Sure, sure, what's going on? - Over the last few weeks the neighborhood has had this horrific, horrible smell. I know it's not your fault, but I think it's coming from your house. - Yeah, yeah, I'm aware. I'm building an entrainment room in my basement, and I hit a sewer line. I've got some guys coming to take a look at it, but, the earliest they're gonna get here is next week. I'm really sorry. - Oh, don't be sorry. I just wanted to make sure everything is okay. - Yeah, thank you very much, I appreciate it. - It's not a bother, if there's anything you need, you let me know. - I will, thank you again, and you have a good day. - You too, bye-bye. - After a couple months the smell was becoming an issue. I did everything I could. I bathed her. I bought those little plug in air fresheners. Those didn't seem to help. Fly strips were important. Wrapping everything in plastic. I mean, that didn't help with the smell, but at least it... - I love us. - So do I. - Stephen? - What's up? - Do I make you happy? - Of course you do. - And this is enough for you? - It's more than enough, it's everything I've ever wanted. - We can't go anywhere. - Why would I wanna go anywhere? Everything I need is right here. Besides, I'm unemployed, I can't take us out anyway. - I just wanna make sure this is truly what you want. - You are what I want. (dramatic music) I didn't know how much longer we could be together at that point, because, I didn't see it, but, she kept telling me that she was falling apart. (talking on TV) (somber music) - Stephen. - What's up, baby? - I'm rotting. - No you're not, everything's gonna be okay. - Sweetheart, you're wrong, I'm rotting. (sighing) - Well, don't concern yourself with it, you always look beautiful to me. - You don't understand. I'm rotting, that means eventually I'm going to be gone. - Let's not worry about that right now. - We have to worry about it right now. If I rot away to nothing, then we can't be together anymore. - Now, you don't know that. - Yes, baby, I do. - Okay. So what do we do? - Well, I have an idea, but, you're not gonna like it. - Try me. - You have to catch up with me. - What do you mean? - I mean, I think you have to kill yourself. - Makes sense. - I thought you'd be a bit more upset about that. - Why? I don't wanna be without you, I'd rather be dead. If it means having to kill myself to ensure that we stay together, then I guess that's what I'm gonna do. - I'm just surprised, is all, I guess. - Well, I'm glad I can still surprise you after all this time. (sighing) So how do we do this? I've never thought about killing myself before. Do I take a bunch of pills, jump off a building? I don't think I could muster up the courage to slit my wrists, so, I think that's out. - Go get my purse. Open it. - Oh. It's a lot heavier than I thought. - And it'll get the job done. - So what, like this? - No, if you do it like that you might just hurt yourself, we don't want that. Put it in your mouth. - Okay, let's do it. - Wait. - Yes? - What if once you do this, we can't make love anymore? - I mean, I guess it's possible. - Well, if it's possible don't you think we should sleep together one last time? - You mean like a farewell bang? (chuckling) - Yeah, if you wanna call it that. - Well, I certainly wouldn't turn that down. (dramatic music) (Stephen breathing hard) - I don't want you to pull the trigger until we're both ready to cum. - I'm feeling the pressure. (crashing) - Ignore it, baby, stay with me. I'm almost there, baby, put the gun in your mouth. - Freeze! Gun! - If they had just waited just 10 more seconds. Just 10 seconds, it woulda been all the difference in the world, we'd be together now. And now she's gone. Now she's gone and I have to find her. I have to find her. I will. I'll get her back. - It's quite a story. I can't imagine what you've been through. I wanna help you, Stephen. Will you let me help you? - Sure. - I just have some papers for you to sign. Can you do that for me? - [Man] Dr. Sutter, your 2:00 p.m. Skype meeting with Detective Bradley is in queue. It appears your time here has been cut short. But that's okay. I think we've done more than enough for one day. You need your rest. Is there anything I can get for you? Now, if you think of anything that'll make you more comfortable, let me know. - [Man] This way Mr. Booth. - Thank you for getting back to me, Detective Bradley. - No problem. So, what's your take on this, Doc? - Well, in the small amount of time I've been able to sit with Mr. Booth, it is abundantly clear that he is a very lonely, very disturbed man. You say there's no prior arrest record, nothing? - Not even so much as a parking ticket. - And there's no history of mental health issues? - None whatsoever that we've been able to find so far. - Is there anything else you think I should know? - Well, when we spoke to the neighbors, they gave us the typical, "He was a quiet man," speech. And the only reason we were tipped off at all is because the woman next door was throwing such a frenzy because of the smell coming from the place. When we finally showed up one of our boys looked into the window, and he saw what was going on in there. And I have to say that the perp was definitely not very discreet. - What about his work? - I spoke to his supervisor, and he confirmed that Mr. Booth had been terminated three months earlier. He also noted that he had other employees there who had lost their shit with him as well, so, that's not out of the ordinary there. But, he did note that for Mr. Booth this was not typical behavior. - Right, right. - Also, I confirmed that they had no record of someone named Nick Perkins ever working there. - Hmm. You think maybe he was covering for someone by using a fake name? - I really do not know. - What about the girl? - She checked out. She was a working girl, and no one on the streets had seen or heard anything from her in the last four months. - Hmm, okay, listen, if you find anything out that may be of help to me, please don't hesitate to contact me. - [Bradley] No problem, and you do the same for me. - For sure. - Here we go, welcome to your spacious accommodations. Transport will be here in the morning. In the meantime, if you need anything, just give me a holler. Might be wise to get some sleep. (door slamming and locking) (soft music) (dramatic music) - Did you get it? - You know I did. - I'm so proud a you. It's not going to hurt at all, and I'll be with you the whole time. - And then we can be together forever. - That's right, sweetheart. Forever.
