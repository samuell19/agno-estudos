[ETHEREAL MUSIC PLAYING] Oh! Hi there, gang. Hurry it up there, will you, Mac? I'm goin' as fast as I can. Believe me, whether you're down there or up here, when it comes to repairs, it's all the same. [GRUNTS] Now let me tell you about my wife, who's down there right now with our son. Boy, if she isn't a dandy. Mmm! And talk about mean. Phew! And cold! Boy! Why, her heart is so cold, you could make a meat-locker out of her chest. She used to bug me and I used to bug her. She used to call me Fatso. That's when I used to drink a whole quart of lard right in front of her. Yeah, she really bugged me. She finally bugged me to death. I mean, literally. Now she's down there with our son and what she's doing to him, you just wouldn't believe. I know one thing, I've got to get down there. Get my hands in things. Or he'll be spreading wings down there long before he gets 'em up here. Not that I have anything against wings, understand. As long as they work. Okay, okay, they'll work. You just can't rush these things, that's all. As I started to say, what I... Here, you wanna finish this? Thanks, Mac. Just don't tell the boss it's a real Havana, huh? Now, what I gotta do is go down there and help that kid. Give him a chance to live a little. Like his old man used to. Lots of luck! DAD: Well, there they are, my kid and my wife, in her best Sunday fangs. Now that may look like a plane to you, but it's a witch on her broom to me. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERY SONG PLAYING] DAD: That's me. Look at the part I get. There's the kid. [BLEATING] [LAUGHING] Just puttin' ya on. Halt! DAD: And there she is, my opponent. In an old suit Prince Valiant used to wear to funerals. My good man, where is my hotel? There's certainly no hotel on the runway. We have not had a hotel on the runway for over... Oh, three weeks now. [CHUCKLES] Not humorous. No. And landing without permission is not humorous! You have holes in your runway. Jonathan, make a note. Get his name and sue him for, er... 10,000. You made me break one of my false fingernails. I had them done in Calcutta with ground yak powder. Very expensive. I'm not interested. Right now, we are not in Calcutta and we have some formalities to endure like... Customs. [WHISTLE BLOWS] [MARCHING DRUMBEAT] [WHISTLING A TUNE] Well, now, have you anything to declare? No. Nothing. Nothing? There seems to be an abundance of nothing, Miss, uh... Missus... Madame. Madame. It's my name, not my profession. Madame Rosepettle. This is my son, Jonathan. DAD: That's my boy. Kinda grabs you, don't it? You can see, he's a real swinger. Wait till he brings out his yo-yo. MADAME: He takes down the names of all those I intend to sue, hate, send to prison, and execute. You must be very busy. He'll be busier if we don't get out of here soon. All right. We will forget these other items... ...and start with this. Now this is a coffin. What a clever man. A regular Charlie Chan. And in coffins there are usually dead people. A genius. And if there's a dead person in this coffin, you cannot come into our country. MADAME: Listen, you usher! My attorneys have been over this thing thoroughly. My husband and I have traveled all over the world in this fashion. [WHISPERS] Your husband! Oh, Madame! I'm deeply sorry! Save it. He's been dead for years. Dead for years? But how is that possible? I don't understand. I mean, the... [ENGINE STARTS] I had him stuffed. [CHEERY SONG PLAYING] [HORN HOOTING MUSICALLY] The Valhalla Nirvana says... Welcome. And Madame Rosepettle says... Why was no one at the airport to meet me? Madame Rosepettle! But you weren't supposed to arrive till this afternoon. I'm so sorry. Wasn't supposed to arrive! Now, who are you to tell me when I should arrive? On whose authority do you presume to tell me when I should arrive? But we have your telegram. It says you will arrive this afternoon. Do you know what time it is in Karachi? Well, do you? No, I'm afraid not. You should be afraid to be afraid not. Jonathan, tell him what time it is in Karachi. [REPLIES IN HINDI] MADAME: In Tokyo. [REPLIES IN JAPANESE] In China. Uh, which dialect? Cantonese. [REPLIES IN MOCK CANTONESE] And you quibble about morning and afternoon. My good man, your time is up. Jonathan, take a note. Have him sent to the North Pole. He won't be so finicky about morning and afternoon up there. Madame jests. The boy is quite a linguist. Now, may I show you to your suite? Unload Madame Rosepettle's luggage. Ooh, this way, if you please. DAD: Guess you're wondering how we kinda got together. Well, it's a tender story. I was walking through the forest. And there she was. I took a thorn out of her paw. And she was grateful. Well, here it is. Here what is?Your suite, it's our best. A sweeping view of the water crowned with tropical vegetation, fit for a queen. What are you getting at? Well, I was only trying to explain the magnificent advantages... Quit gushing. Well, Jonathan, how do you like it? [SNIFFING] He's very sensitive about rooms. He's extremely intelligent. Of course. Well, darling? I... DAD: That's tellin' her, kid. He likes it. Ah! Now then... Here... Here is the little lad's room. This is where you sleep, little one. Isn't it pretty? Thank you, Mummy. Never call me "Mummy"! DAD: How about Godzilla? I am not a "Mummy". I am Mother. DAD: Tear your heart out? She will. Mother. DAD: By the roots. Say it. Mother. [STUTTERING] Thank you, Mother. He's very well-behaved. Yes. A firm but gentle hand. I hope I have my own bathroom. Such a pleasure to see a young gentleman so well brought up. Madame is pleased? Madame is wondering what is to be done about that vulgar shaft of sunlight. Madame is certain that her instructions included a black velvet drape over every window in her room. Oh, the boys haven't put it up yet. See that they do. Soon! Except for that, it's quite a nice room. Rather... Comforting. [DOORBELL RINGS] MADAME: Well! It's about time. Put it in the bedroom. Gently, gently, gently. No, no, no, not there. By the bed. Perfectly all right. It's my husband. Oh, he's been dead for years. Well, if there's anything any of you require, please don't hesitate to call on me. [DOOR CLOSES] What are you seeing, little one? [STUTTERING] Nothing. Just boats. Not boats, Jonathan. Yachts. Poor people look at boats. We look at yachts. Commodore! You said we would come out here to swim. Yes, swimming, what a lovely diversion. [LAUGHING MISCHIEVOUSLY] Yes, the back stroke, the side stroke, the breast stroke. Ah, swimming, yes. How graceful the salmon leap upstream and spawn. But we're not salmon, Mister Roseabove! No, no, no, but perhaps we can swim and maybe spawn. Uh, I don't wanna spawn. I wanna swim. Hey! No, no, no. No, wait, wait! Oh, hold it! Damn it! He loves to spy. Don't you? Now, don't you? [TITTERING] [LAUGHING] Aw! [COMMODORE LAUGHING] Yes, the back... Ha! The mommy salmon needs help and here's the daddy salmon coming to her assistance. Ahoy there! Ahhh! Whoa! Hold it. Whoa! That's one of the cutest yachts I have ever seen. Wouldn't that be nice for our little family? [DOOR OPENS] BELLBOYS: We're back, Madame. MADAME: Ah! We're about to unveil our treasures. All right. Case number... Jonathan, pay attention. Case number one. Oh, my darlings! These are piranhas. They eat human flesh. Unfortunately, we must compromise. These fish like Siamese cats and I want Siamese cats for them. Do you comprehend? And don't try to sneak in some inferior breed. Next case. Robinson, my boy, your fabulous stamp collection. Thank you. Ah! Take it to my little one's bedroom. Now, boys, watch this. His fantastic coin collection. And now, darling, your sensational library. [MADAME CHUCKLING] My little bookworm. [BOTH TITTERING] Out! You two. Continue, my son. [DOOR CLOSES] [STUTTERING] My sensational library... DAD: Some sensational library. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Charlie, the Little Choo-Choo, and a censored version of Alice In Wonderland. Ah! Enough! And now for my treat, my Venus Flytraps. Put them on the balcony. Not too close together. They fight. BOTH: Will that be all, Madame? All except one thing. Which one of you has failed to seal the window in my bedroom? BOTH: We have the drape in the hall, Madame. Get it. I expressly asked that every window be covered. I cannot have sunlight come into my chamber. I am in mourning. "...down the rabbit hole." You realize that this bit of inefficiency has cost the lot of you any future tips. Black is the color of my true love's boudoir. Jonathan, come help me hang your father in the closet. DAD: Let Mumsey do it herself, son. It is my fondest wish to give her a hernia. You'd think you'd learn by now. Learn what? I go there to go swimming... That horrible fish routine starts. [SCOFFS] My fish routine, as you call it, has hooked me many a treasure. Commodore, tell me the truth. Hmm? If I didn't jump overboard every day, if I stayed, and I fell for that line and didn't swim, what would happen? Why, it would spoil all my fun, wouldn't it? Yes, exactly. So why go through it? Why don't we just be friends, like a grandfather and granddaughter? Grandfather? Father and daughter? Oh! Uncle and niece? It all sounds immoral to me. And you don't want to be a dirty old man for the rest of your life, do you? I'm not old. No, no. No, no, no. Oh, waiter. Yes, Madame? I have some instructions for you. In my room there is a little boy. He will take all of his meals there. Each of his meals consists of the same thing. Get your pencil. The room is 106. For breakfast, lunch and dinner, he will have one hamburger, well-done, with catsup. One glass of milk, and for dessert... DAD: Send up a broad. ...one maraschino cherry. You will deliver these items at 8:00 a.m...DAD: Make it two. ...12:00 noon, and 6:00 p.m. You will not converse with him, nor smile, nor touch, nor raise an eyebrow. Do you understand? Yes, Madame. Then hop it. [KISSING] What about Lady Crookeshaft?[CHOKING] Oh, yes. She's oversexed and over 70. No, I think I'll up me anchor and find some place fresh. And where would that be? Maybe the Virgin Islands. There you go, thinking young again. Well, damn it, where can I find something mature and in good working order? [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] Commodore Roseabove, I presume? You know me? [CHUCKLING] Do I know Rolls-Royce, Steinway, Dom Perignon? The Commodore is too modest. You have me at a disadvantage, dear lady. May I please, ask your name? My name is Madame Rosepettle. Madame. Yes, please join me. I was just telling Moses here, how I longed to see a lovely woman and now fate has brought me someone beyond my dreams. Well, you might call It fate. And just think, Commodore Roseabove, we won't even have to change our monograms. [SCREAMS] Hello. What are you doing? I'm doing my yogi. I do it every night before dinner. It stimulates me. DAD: Didn't think I could do it, did you? Well, there's the dessert. Upside down cake. Isn't it kinda dangerous? [LAUGHS] No, it's stimulating. Hey, you're kinda cute. What's your name? I said, what's your name? My real name? Of course. DAD: You're doin' fine, boy. She's walkin' right into your trap. Hey, you shouldn't... You shouldn't be here. I'll... My mother's due back and I'm not allowed to talk to strangers. Why, if you tell me your name, we won't be strangers. My name is Rosalie. I... I saw you today. Yes. I... I saw you swimming and... And I saw you with an older man. What's your name? Jonathan. Jonathan Rosepettle. Really, Jonathan Rosepettle the Third. There wasn't any Second, but my mother thought it would be more distinguished to be Jonathan Rosepettle the Third than... DAD: How about getting to work on Jonathan the Fourth, hmm? Why? Why? I don't know why. It's what it's what she... It's what she told me. Hey... Hey, look, you better go. She's due back and I'm not supposed to talk to people. Why? Why? Every time I say why, you say why. Why? Well, why? There! You did it again. Ma'am, please. Rosalie. I'm your neighbor. Rosalie. Rosalie, look, please go. I mean, I'm not supposed to talk to people. I asked you why and you haven't told me. If you tell me, maybe I'll go.Well... Do you have some sort of infectious disease? No. Are you some sort of monk? No. Are you crazy? No. Then what is it? I'm pure. Pure. Pure! Oh! And I'm also a genius. Oh! Genius. [PLANT GROWLING] [SCREAMS] Help! Get this thing off me! Stop, stop. Stop! Get off her. [SNARLING] Bad, bad, bad, bad. What are those plants? Oh, uh, they're Venus Flytraps. They eat flies and things. Trouble is, they aren't very smart. They don't know a fly from a girl. I'm glad you noticed. Well, I'll see you around. Uh... How about a swim tomorrow? I can't. I mean... I don't go out. I forgot. You're pure. Untainted. I used to be when I was a baby. Since then I've been having fun. Arrivederci. Any time you feel like getting a little tainted, give me a holler. DAD: Start hollering, boy.[CHUCKLING] They'll be tainting tonight on the old camp ground. Phew! She's the girl of my dreams. [PLAYING CHEERY TUNE] [BOTH CHUCKLING] I knew the moment I saw you, you were a man whose appetite needed stimulation. Well, now they have been stimulated, what may I do for you? I'm curious. About what? Secrets. I love secrets. You want to know a secret? Mmm-hmm. I'm horribly rich. [MADAME LAUGHS] Lovely! Disgustingly rich. Oh, tantalizing! [LAUGHING] I love to see you laugh. Then open that big rich mouth of yours. We're going to have fun. [BOTH LAUGHING] Oh, Commodore! [LAUGHING] Oh, oh! Shh! We sneak up on 'em very carefully and whamo! No, no, we don't dance now. Later. And then the sand hits them right in the face. Got it? Come on. Shh! Shh! Tippy-toe, tippy-toe! What is it? I forgot what we do. We are the Society to Prevent Lovemaking on Beaches. SPLOB. S-P-L-O-B. The Society for the Prevention of Speeches on Lovemaking. Er... Yes. Commodore, come on, shh! Quiet now. Splob! Splob! Stop. Come on! [CHUCKLING] This is nasty fun! We've only begun to splob. Come on, come on! Ah, good morning, good morning, my little pumpkin! What on earth are you doing? [STUTTERING] I'm turning my telescope into a periscope. Well, Mother has an important engagement. Bye-bye, little one. Be good! DAD: [SCOFFING] That's like reminding the sphinx to shut up! Oh boy, for a tidal wave now. Mmm! Here she comes, like a captured queen bearing her treasured offering. I think the lady is bringing lunch, sir. Lunch! Don't be so prosaic. She's bringing praise to Caesar. MADAME: You weren't so lonely yesterday. I saw you with that young thing, you naughty boy. [CHUCKLING] Oh, that girl? Ohhh... She was just a fly by night. Yeah, well, you don't have to explain to me. I... I must... I want to. I thought you invited me out here to swim. Ah, swimming, yes. What a heavenly diversion. How gracefully the salmon do it, nosing their way upstream and leaping into places to spawn, Madame. Swimming is delightful, of course... [GROWLS] Madame, wait, wait. Come back! What did I say? Come back! You forgot your dishes. Oh. Oh, damn it! DAD: He'd sure make a lousy U-boat commander. Oh, damn it, Hawkins. They keep leaping overboard. Yes, sir. And this time, it really hurt. She's taken my heart with her. I'm sorry, sir. Why do they do it? And keep on doing it? Why? I think, sir, that it's that old salmon routine. Hey! If you don't mind my saying so, sir, it stinks. Oh, good morning, Madame Rosepettle. Save it. [SNAPS FINGERS] Who's the woman in the room above us? 206? Let me see... The little hoochie-coocher. Who pays her bills? Oh, that's Rosalie. Rosalie. She's our babysitter. Yes, she's the hotel babysitter. I thought you didn't allow children in this hotel. Quite so, but one may slip through now and then, and Rosalie... I thought so. I thought so. Oh, it's nothing like that, nothing... Save it. Forget I was here. Operator, this is Madame Rosepettle. Tell the manager I'd like to have the babysitter come to 106 at 7:00 this evening. Thank you. Watch your son, Albert. Watch him with this harlot. You'll see I've taken every bit of you out of him. DAD: Well, don't throw anything away, Mumsey. He may need it later. [DOORBELL RINGS] [DOORBELL RINGS] You can't come... Come here, you can't come in! Come on! Yes, I can. Your mother invited me. She didn't. She did. She did? Yes, she did. Well, my mother's out. She won't be back for hours. So? I don't understand. You don't have to understand. Maybe it's your birthday? Maybe I'm your birthday present. DAD: Yeah. Your birthday present. Unwrap it. Unwrap it! Aw, unwrap it! Say, um... Don't you ever go out? I mean, sometimes you simply must go out. You just couldn't stay inside all the time. [CHUCKLING] Could you? Yes. You mean... You mean, you never go out at all? I mean, never at all? [SIGHING] Sometimes, I go out on the balcony and I catch things for the Venus Flytraps, you know, the plant that grabbed you the other day. Oh. Mother says everyone must have a, uh... ...vocation in life, and I guess that's my job. I'm a Venus Flytrap feeder. You know, I... I don't think I've ever met anyone before who's fed Venus Flytraps. Well, mother says I'm pretty good at it. I don't know if I am, but it's what she says. DAD: I don't think anything's gonna happen for the next four or five minutes. In case you wanna get some popcorn or something. What do you feed them? Oh, well, I feed them... I feed them lots of things. Uh, green peas, chicken feathers, rubber bands. They're not very fussy. Mother says it gives me a feeling of accomplishment. Would you like to see me feed them? No! Um... I... I don't like to see things eat chicken feathers and rubber bands. I eat hamburgers three times a day. Mother says I shouldn't be confused by... By a lot of different foods, so we... So she chose... [CHUCKLING] Hamburgers, you know, with ketchup. [SLURPING] Lots of ketchup, and really lots and lots of ketchup. [SLURPING] And they're terribly red. You know what I still don't understand? Why you never go out. Well... How can you just sit inside all the time? I do other interesting things. You know, I do other things. I... What?Well, when I'm on the balcony, I... I do other things. I... What sort of things? Huh? You mean spying on me? Yes, you mean looking at me through that periscope thing. No, I... I don't have a periscope! I mean... It's a telescope. But it was a periscope. And you saw me. Oh, no... Yes, you... You might have seen lots of me. No. Maybe all of me. Did you see all of me? No, listen, I use the telescope to look at airplanes. I... Originally, I got the lenses to study my stamps when mother suspected that some of the stamps were fakes. So far, I've discovered I have three actual fakes. Number 1,352,766. Number 1,352,768 was a fake. And they were stuck together. No! No, don't do that! You don't even know me. But... But I'm... I want to know you. But... We're not friends. We don't... We don't share a common interest. [CHUCKLING] Oh, yes, oh, yes, we do! [WHISPERING] Jonathan, kiss me. Kiss me on the lips, my big, red, luscious, sexy, ketchup-eating lips. DAD: Go on, boy. Make believe it's a hamburger. No! DAD: All of a sudden, he can't stand hamburger. Just get out![LAUGHING] What's the matter with him? [WHIMPERING] Now, now, now, now, now, now, little one. Aw! Who are you? I am his mother. Oh. [SOBBING] Well, harlot, how much do I owe you? I'm not a harlot. I'm not! Don't call me that. I'm a babysitter. Besides you don't owe me a thing. Nothing happened. Of course not. I knew that. Now get out. Oh there, there, little Jonathan. Mummy's here. Yes. That's my boy. Mother's here to look after you. Why did you invite me here? Why? Why did you call on me? Hmm? My little boy seemed to have an interest in you. I got him his fabulous stamp collection, his fantastic coin collection, his sensational library and I got him you for a little while and you saw what happened. Oh, did I see what happened! Ooh! He's strange. He is pure and purity flees from such as you. He's... He's frustrated and he's not normal. Normal? My Albert normal?Albert? I thought his name was Jonathan. His name is Albert or Edward or anything I choose, according to my mood. His name is anything that you don't call him. Call him? I call him? You... You called me. And now I'm telling you to get out. Okay. I'm going. I don't wanna stay, believe me. There, there, little one. There my little... [WHIMPERING] Good night, Jonathan. [WHISPERING] Edward, Albert. MADAME: Just one moment. Now, darling, beddy-bye time. Off we go. One more item, my sweet. I saw you with Commodore Roseabove yesterday. From now on, he's off limits. What? I'm telling you once and only once. He is my property. Who do you think you are? Who? I am the protector of innocence, the guardian of purity and the destroyer of cheap tawdry floozies who get in my way! Pleasant dreams. We'll see. We'll see. [CLICKING] [CLICKING] [CLICKING] [CLICKING] DAD: Well, that's a start. You look like a bunny. Now let's find him one. Great, kid. They're wallet size! Hey, don't waste 'em! Throw 'em in the closet with me! How about that, sports fans? I guess one picture is worth a thousand words. And one girl is worth a thousand pictures. That's it, Johnny boy! You've got the ball now and you're gonna carry it right down the field and across the goal line. Look at him go, fans. They can't stop him. What guts! What daring! He's at mid-field. He's through the secondary and still on his feet. He's down to the 40, he's down to the 30, the 20, the 10. He's gonna... He's gonna... He's... BREKENDUFF: Good morning, Mr. Rosepettle. DAD: Hey, wait. Come back! No, boy, no! You fool! You're running the wrong way. Oh, no! And it's a touchdown! For mother. [RINGING] I'm not allowed to talk on the phone! [CONTINUES RINGING] Stop ringing! Please just stop ringing! [CONTINUES RINGING] I'm not allowed to talk on the phone. Ah, I haven't felt like this for years. It sounds like love. Hmm. Feels like gas. Hmm. Remarkable woman. You were right, Moses. No more chasing after the young ones. Now I've got what I want. Good morning, Commodore. Good morning, child. "Child"? [SCOFFING] You age yourself too much. You look so young today. So virile. So handsome. Thank you, child. Well... Uh... Commodore, I've been thinking. Mmm-hmm? So have I. I think that we should re-think our relationship. Oh? I wasn't aware that there was a relationship to re-think. Yes. That's just it. Mmm-hmm. We've been much too cautious, darling. Mmm-hmm. Little darling, it'll all be for the best. No, no. We must re-work everything. We must rekindle the fire. Oh, my darling! What do you think? No! I think I'll play some billiards. Oh! Uh... I was hoping we could go out to the yacht to swim upstream. Well, uh, late tonight, I'll send for you. Mmm! Why not now? COMMODORE: Well, I have to practice some shots. ROSALIE: All right, all right. I'll play billiards with you then. How do I do it? Well, uh... Is this right? Not quite, no. I see you're... You're left-handed.Mmm. No, you... [BALLS CLATTERING] The idea is to put him in a pocket. That's how you win the game. COMMODORE: Ah, Madame. Madame, I was just showing the young lady a trick shot. Carry on. But Madame, Madame, I assure you, it was purely a demonstration. Oh, silly man, you needn't explain to me. It's a game, something to while away the afternoon. Of course. You need your relaxation. All work and no play. [CHUCKLING] Ta-ta! But... But I think of the child as a... As a daughter. She turns to me for help. MADAME: Such a wonderful man! Oh, but you are kind and dear and dependable. Toodle-oo! Toodle-oo! I bought your father a new coffin today. Something for the tropics. I'm having it done in Irish Linen with roses filigreed on the edges. Ah!Oh. Are you ill?DAD: I am. No. Well, then what is it? Nothing. Oh. [LAUGHS] Is it that... That... That girl, that... That thing? No. You've plenty of time for girls. You're only 25. Yes, Mother. Well, now, darling, come here to mother. How are your hamburgers? [EXCLAIMS] Red. Okay. Mother, could I go for a walk one day? Just... Of course you can go for a walk. When we get to Bora-Bora. There's a nice path along the water, a nice shady path. But that's six months off. Now, now, now, darling, now, don't be restless. You go play with your stamp collection or read a book. [DOORBELL RINGS] [CHUCKLING] Now, Madame... [LAUGHS] DAD: Love Finds Andy Hardy. Just a couple of crazy kids... Hand in hand and bunion to bunion. What is it you want? I want you. I've been going crazy without you. Oh, Madame, let there be me and you, the sand, the moon... Silly boy. [BOTH CHUCKLING] We've splobbed other people. Let us be the ones to be splobbed. You mean you want to neck on the beach? [CHUCKLING] [MADAME WHOOPING] Hi. Dad. Dad, I want to talk to you. Uh, at you. As... Well, you realize by now, you're dead. And since you are, I just wondered, how would you like to be buried? In some swell place where there are lots of trees and flowers, and I... I could come to visit you, and... You don't have to answer right away. I'm seriously considering getting married... And... And if... If you were settled some place and I... I could come to see you... Well, you have to admit, it's a thought. DAD: The boy really loves me. He wants to see me buried, bless his heart. [ROSALIE SCREAMS] Ow! What are you doing out of your room? MAN: Who's he? Jonathan. MAN: Where do you come from? [STUTTERING] 106. I come from 106, right up there. MAN: I think he's nuts. No, he's not! Jonathan, you escaped. Oh, that was very brave! I slipped. I was trying to do my yogi. MAN: Well, you sure picked a lousy time to do it. See you later, Rosalie. What were you doing down here? I, uh... Well, uh... We... We were looking for four-leaf clover. Harold, that's my friend, he's a four-leaf clover collector. They're very rare. You... You have many interests. Yeah. I have many varied interests too. That's why I don't have any time because I'm so busy. That's why, uh... I don't go out. Oh, but you're out. You're out now! Look, Jonathan, you're outside. Yes, I am. I slipped. Oh! No, no, don't worry. I'll take care of you. I love you. I love you. [WALTZ MUSIC PLAYING] Madame... Ah, I have waited for this moment. To hold you in my arms and feel your heart beating against mine. Mmm, yours seems to be beating rather fast. Do you think you can take this waltz? It will take a waltz, a tango, anything for you. [GIGGLING] Well, then, shall we waltz right up to my place and test it? Ah! Oh. [SNAPPING FINGERS] [PLAYING MELLOW TUNE] [MADAME LAUGHING] [MADAME SIGHING] [MADAME CHUCKLING] You devastate me. [CHUCKLING] I try. [PLAYING ROMANTIC TUNE] What's this? This holds my secrets. I'm reciprocating for yours. I always pay back. There isn't a man, living or dead, who hasn't been rewarded by having known me. When shall I get my reward? It's imminent, my dear Commodore. But you don't want to rush it. I do, I do. I love you. [CORK POPPING] Aw... [CHUCKLING] Of course you do. But first we're going to look at what love can do. I warn you, my Commodore, what you're going to see may shock you. Dear lady, I am a man of the world. I have seen and heard things that would bug the eyes out of statues. I have tasted every pleasure, and witnessed the foulest of deeds, depravities and perversions. It was sweet of you to think you could shock me. It's virtually impossible. [LAUGHING] Well said. You must be thirsty. Of course. And now we shall begin. DAD: I think I'll let Madame DeMille do all the talking during this little masterpiece. Besides, I want to take a look at myself. MADAME: I retained my innocence much longer than other girls. At 28, I was still a virgin. And fast on my feet. But I wasn't ignorant. No, Commodore. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] I studied men in my spare time. And I knew that outside my door, the world was waiting eagerly to devour those who trust in it. [KNOCKING CONTINUES] One unfortunate day, however, I let down my guard. His name was Albert Edward Robinson Rosepettle the Third. He had the world's smallest eyes. He was also short of breath. Or maybe it was the scent of my innocence that overwhelmed him. [TRUMPETING] We seemed made for each other. [BABY CRYING] I was shy, he was outgoing. [CRYING LOUDLY] I was poor, he was rich. Oh, he wasn't really in the Salvation Army. That was just part of his playfulness. All in all, I thought I'd finally found Mister Right. And so... With all of Albert's friends attending, we were married. I started life at the Rosepettle mansion, thinking the aroma came from the quaint old furnishings. Until our wedding dinner was served. I had also thought, Commodore, that Albert was different from other men. But under the hypocrisy of that smile, he was on the same track, chasing the same rabbit. And then... [SNORING] After he had taken my most valued possession, there he was. A little food, a little sex, and he was snoring his satisfaction. His little mind dreaming wild and sinful fantasies that were written all over his face. [SNAPPING FINGERS] I moved out of his bedroom that very night, but it was already too late. Albert couldn't tie his shoes without fumbling. He missed his mouth with half of his food. And yet, like some mad kamikaze pilot who'd been saved for one deadly mission, he got me pregnant. After that, Commodore, he tried all sorts of foolish ways to lure me back into his bed. He assumed exotic poses, hoping to titillate my senses. [EXCLAIMING IN PAIN] He even baited his trap with mink. But the coat reeked of sauerkraut. He finally gave up. With me, anyway.[DOORBELL RINGING] Instead, he brought in a French maid. Or at least she wore a maid's uniform. And we lived a not unpleasant year that way. Albert becoming so busy with domestic duties that he quite forgot me. [MAID GIGGLING] One afternoon, he came home to read the paper. [CHUCKLES] I guess his club must've burned down. Since I hadn't bothered to tell him about the baby... [BABY CRYING] It came as quite a surprise to him. [BABY CRYING] [STAMMERING] The fellow who plays your husband, Albert, he's a pretty good actor. An actor? [CHUCKLING] That is Albert. The indelicate part comes next. The Other Woman, I suppose that's what you'd call her, indulged Albert in sports, both outdoor, and indoor. As for me, I was a mother now. And I devoted myself to raising my son, and taking care of the house and garden. Frankly, Commodore, I was much happier in the kitchen than I'd been in the bedroom. My only desire was to keep my child as far away from his father as possible. Unfortunately, on occasion, Albert would try to interfere, arousing my maternal instinct, and I felt compelled to fight back. Under the circumstances, you'll appreciate how difficult it was to teach my child proper table manners. Meanwhile, back in the bedroom, Albert, like all other men, was hotly pursuing his fate. [WHISTLES] By the way, Commodore, I wasn't jealous. Merely curious as to what she could possibly see in that lecherous buffoon. But somehow, as you can observe, they did seem to have a lot in common. Remarkable. Photography. MADAME: The next morning, we were all in for a little surprise. [INAUDIBLE] Albert's appetite was just too much for him. I guess his eyes were bigger than his stomach. One of life's perfect little jokes, I would say. Wouldn't you, Commodore? DAD: Well, now you've seen her version of our wedded life. Someday, I'll show you mine. If I can ever get it away from the censors. They're crazy about it! What are you doing down there? Are you proposing? DAD: No, he's praying for the French maid's phone number. Come, come, my hearty Commodore, we can't go through life like some peculiar quadruped, hmm? But... He was so young. He still is. I saved him from old age, and I'll do the same, the very same for you. Hmm? No, no. [CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY] Thank you, dear lady. I'm all right as I am. I'd best be going. MADAME: So you'd rather be lonely. Well, go on, go on, go on, go on. Go and start your childish search again for happiness. Go back to your miserable and empty little affairs with cheap harlots. [NERVOUSLY] No, Madame, please. You are perfectly right in wanting to escape me. You have every reason to leave. You think I'm responsible for Albert's death, don't you? You think I was a poor wife. Perhaps I was. I understand, my dear Commodore. You go now. Go back to your fun and games. [CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY] Madame, I... I assure you, I... I had no intention of, uh... I know, I know, I know. How could you love me? COMMODORE: But I do love you. MADAME: Oh, no, you don't. Well, damm it, I do! I don't believe you, Commodore. [STAMMERING] What can I do to make you believe me? What can I do? You mean you still love me after what you've seen? More so. He was a rotten scoundrel and he deserved to die. I really love you. Say it again. With feeling! I love you. Come on, my Commodore, then take me, take me. [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] DAD: I don't blame you, kid, it wasn't even a talkie. Go on, boy, go on. Let off a little steam. Yeah, let 'em get their own flies. And they can get their own cats. Goodbye, security blanket, hello, nylons. Jonathan, what have you done? Jonathan... What have you done? Did you hurt yourself? I killed them. Your mother too? You killed your mother? Her...things. You sure made a mess around here. Here, Jonathan, look at my dress. Jonathan, guess why I'm wearing such a pretty new dress. She says such bad things about you. She says you do things with men. Do you? Jonathan, come away with me. [SIGHING DEEPLY] Let's run away, Jonathan, far away, tonight. Both of us together. Let's run and run, far, far away. Oh, you do! [SOBBING] Oh, you do! Jonathan, I... I won't lie to you. First of all, I love you. Before, I loved a lot of people, but only a little. I just wish that I'd been a concert pianist instead, then you would understand better. Jonathan, pretend that I'm a concert pianist. I'm playing a beautiful concerto, and making people happy. What concerto do you like, Jonathan? Grieg's. Yes, I'm playing Grieg's Concerto. In A minor. What difference does it make? "What difference does it make?" It makes a lot of difference because if you were playing Grieg's Concerto in B flat, you'd make a lot of people unhappy, because Grieg's Concerto was in A minor! All right, I'm playing Grieg's Concerto in A minor and a lot of people are very happy. They're happy because I'm playing in A minor and they're also happy because I'm playing it beautifully. Now, as a concert pianist who has just come to your room immediately after playing Grieg's Concerto, will you go away with me? DAD: [WHISPERING] Why not, boy? Go now. Pay later. I can't. No... I... I can't. I mean, I want to go away with you, but I'm afraid. Yeah. What time will your mother be back? DAD: Mmm, here's a girl after my own heart. Not for a while. [STUTTERING] This is my mother's bedroom and we're not, uh... [SLURRING SLEEPILY] Oh, what a comfortable bed. Uh... You better get off the bed. I think I'll take a nap. This is my mother's room and we're not allowed to be here. [HUMMING] Jonathan... I'll come out if you give me something first. What are you going to give me? DAD: Don't miss the answer to this one, son. A... A book. I'll... I'll go get a book. DAD: I don't believe it! Chapter one is "Down the Rabbit Hole. "Alice..." Let me... Let me read it. "Alice, you see, was beginning to get very tired "of sitting by her sister on the bank, "and of having nothing to do. "Once or twice she had peeped into the book "her sister was reading but it had no..." Come on, Jonathan, I want to show you something. What... What is it you want to show me? Come on, sit down. No, um... I'm okay here. Listen, I can't show you if you don't sit down. [SIGHING LOUDLY] Do you want to read the book? Yes.All right... No... Jonathan. I love you, Jonathan, and I want you now. I want you, Jonathan. I won't give you up. Do you want me to explain the story about Alice? Forget about the book, and look at me. Look at my eyes, my mouth, my hands, my legs. Look at me, Jonathan. Are you still afraid? No, I'm not afraid. No! I'm afraid. DAD: It's all right, sweetheart. Take your time. What's a few more minutes when he's been waiting 25 years? Come, Jonathan. Lie with me. Let me show you how beautiful it is. Everything will be wonderful. DAD: Sorry, son, I slipped on a mothball. [EXCLAIMING IN SHOCK] Who the hell is this? [STAMMERING] It's... [PANTING] What a stupid place to keep a corpse. It's all right. Everything's fine again. DAD: Forget it, you crazy fool, you're dead. Dead! Oh! That's my father. Jonathan, stop looking at him, he's dead. Look at me, I'm alive. Stop, just stop. My mother was right. You're... You're dirty. No, I'm not dirty. I'm full of love and womanly feelings. I renounce all my past lovers, Jonathan. I confess my indiscretions. I ask your forgiveness. Now you know all, so I'm pure again. Take off your clothes. No. But my father... Forget about your father. Drop your pants on him, then you won't see his face. Listen, but my mother... No, forget about your mother. She's gone. Yeah. Yes. Forget them both and look at me. Yes. Yes. Oh, Jonathan, love is so beautiful. Yes. Yeah. Now... [SEDUCTIVELY] Come, Jonathan. Lie down. Come... You'll be all mine. Lie down. Let me show you how beautiful it is... [GIGGLING SEDUCTIVELY] Love! DAD: No, no, that's not the way! I can't look! No, boy, no. Cut it out! Stop it! Stop it, I tell you. Stop it! ...I take thee, Madame, to be my lawful wedded wife. And I take thee, Commodore. And so, by my authority as Captain of the high seas, I declare this marriage valid and it be entered in the log. I therefore pronounce us mad. I mean, man and wife. I must be going.But, Madame... Oh, to tell Jonathan the good news. I'll be back later this morning and we'll sail away. But Madame, our toast. Hawkins! Yes, sir? Do I look sick? I'm sorry, sir, but Madame has restricted that kind of information. If the Commodore wishes to know if it's a nice day, a hot day, or a cloudy day, I'm at liberty to tell him. All other questions will be referred to Madame. [GLASS SHATTERING] Darling heart! My little curmudgeon! Jon... My fish! My plants! Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan, where are you? [JONATHAN STAMMERING] All right, Robinson. This whole place is a mess. Lying on my bed is a girl, and I do believe she has stopped breathing. And you haven't eaten your hamburger. Now I ask you, Edward, as a mother to a son, I ask you, what is the meaning of this? Jonathan! Oh! Damn you, Albert. Hello! Anybody in? Huh? MADAME: Edward! Edward! Jonathan, Jonathan, wait! You haven't heard the good news! Mother's got something nice to tell you! Madame! I think you should know... Does anybody know? Jonathan is all upset. I think you should have a talk with him. After all, you're one of his fathers. Jonathan. Er... Edward! Edward! Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan! Madame! Jonathan, come back! Come back or I'll tell your fathers! Edward! Edward! Edward! Edward, stop! Wait, darling! Darling, it's mother! Listen... Jonathan! Edward! You haven't even had your breakfast! Madame! What's happened? I want to talk to you! MADAME: Mother's getting a little tired, Jonathan! Listen to me! Woman! Damn it! MADAME: Darling, we'll make it a cheeseburger, a cheeseburger with relish and pickles! DAD: Well, she finally flipped her wig. Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan! Help me! Edward! You can even take a new name. DAD: And how about this, gang? He's finally cutting the cord. MADAME: Jonathan! Oh, my poor boy, you can't swim. I can't swim. Thank you, Mother. Albert! Save Jonathan, he's gone under! Madame, I can't swim. Don't change the subject. Jump in the water. What's the matter? I feel terribly ill. Oh, shut up! Seriously ill. [ETHEREAL MUSIC PLAYING] DAD: Well, all's well that ends well. The Commodore is in the second coffin with Rosalie in his arms. You see, boy gets girl. Yes, boy gets girl and they're riding off together into the sunset. I love happy endings myself. I think everybody does. All these movies today, so downbeat, depressing, who needs 'em? Right, gang? [STUTTERING] Mother, do you think I can have Rosalie in my room? Of course, darling, it'll be nice for you to have someone to talk to. I love you, Mother! Of course you do. And there isn't anything I wouldn't do for you, son. After all, what's a mother for? DAD: You see what I mean, gang? What we had here was a simple little tale of a mother's love for her son. Clean, wholesome, a family-type picture like... LikeBambi, Dumbo, Mondo Cane. [CHEERY SONG PLAYING]
