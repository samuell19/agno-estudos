What does that mean? Means that it wasn't on a label. Completely independent. It was recorded and pressed in 1971 by a garage rock band, The Culture Monks. Gregg Lynn on guitar, Stoney Carter on bass, Spike White on drums. The B side was untitled. They only printed 50 copies. Each record was hand distributed by the band. There's only one copy left.

This is the B side. Shit. My favorite pastime is searching through the aisles of, you know, the vinyl record store and find a little gem nobody's heard before. And then you get to have that relationship and that connection with one song. It's like your little baby. There's been a lot of great music that's gone completely missed. Zack Lee, he ripped off the lick. That's what this is all about, a ripped-off guitar lick? The lick? The bridge, the solo, everything, man, the whole tune! That's what this is about? No! No! It's about integrity! It's about honesty! It's about the-- It's about the whole fucking thing, man! Listen! He's--This motherfucker stole everything from me! I can't get gas without hearing my music. My music's shilling everything but ass soap! But it's copyrighted, Gregg. Why didn't you fight it? Because I didn't have proof! I didn't have a copy of it. I didn't have a copy of my own record! But I do now. On a lighter note... another cocktail, Murphy? No, thanks. Well, I think I might. ♪ K-SOFT 105 ♪ Where light rock stays alive ♪ You can change the station if you want. That's just on to calm my nerves. I've, uh, somewhat lost my taste for rock 'n' roll. What about Mike Lockwood? He, uh, found a copy of it, my record. And I don't know where. You know, it was somewhere. I guess he was just being generous. Nicest guy. He's-- heh heh--came by to give it to me. Uh, to give it back to me. So you did see him? Yeah. Why didn't you say that before? He, uh-- He wouldn't give it to me. I told him it's mine, you know. I created it. I wrote it. I recorded it. But he didn't care, you know. He had some scheme to get rich blackmailing that seven-sided son of a bitch, Lee. Actually, it's extortion, Gregg. Blackmail's something a bit different. Was just another cocky motherfucker trying to sucker me. And I'm done, all right? Gregg Lynn is done being fucked in the ass! Think about it! I didn't have a copy of my own recording, man, my baby, and here comes this asshole hustler telling me it's his, trying to pull rank, telling me he's not gonna give me what's mine? First Lee, and then this two-bit prick Lockwood! Fucking Los Angeles, man. It's total bullshit! Just relax.What? Relax. What about Ziggy Schultz? Look, I am nobody's bitch anymore, all right? All right, how do you get this shit off vibrate? I could show you. That's Mike's phone, you know. Where are they, Gregg? Trust me, Dunn. They're in a better place. What's that behind your back there, Gregg? What? This? You said you'd call.I'm sorry. What are we gonna do with him? What do you think he weighs? Gimme. You can't just put it up to your ear. What?

Where's "here"? Pink Motel, Sun Valley, room 20. Sun Valley? Give me 20 minutes. I'll give you 19. I'm gonna kill you, you motherfucker! Stop the car, Murphy! I hate trunks, man. This is bullshit! Ah, Moof. Yeah, what? Come on! Come on! You're wet. Uh... no, okay. It's okay. That's fine, all right? It's all right. Uh, how much time we got? I'm claustrophonic, man.

Have you ever heard of BlueGram? Hmm? The BlueGram Company? Mm-hmm. Liquor, right, among other stuff? Well, that's a bit of it, sure. No, BlueGram owns controlling interest in 47 corporations worldwide, one of which is Industry Records. Bottom line, you got something I want, Dunn. Zack Lee, the, uh--that song. Mm. "Fuzz Track"? Well, that song has been licensed to more than 75 corporations worldwide for purposes of advertising and publicity for over a year now. If it were proven that that music wasn't original, well, now that's just the kind of accounting headache I'm trying to prevent. And as CEO, I am responsible to hardworking stockholders who pay me very well to keep this kind of shit on their shoes from happening. What's in it for me? Exactly. What do you want? One, I was promised a bonus of $50,000 if I showed results. Since I have, I'd like my money. Not a problem, Dunn. There's a case by your feet. Whew. All done. 12 hours later, they found the bodies of Mike Lockwood and Ziggy Schultz buried not 50 yards from Gregg Lynn's trailer. Excuse me.
