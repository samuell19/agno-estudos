(Every name of company or organizations) (is not real and modified for the movie.) (Beak Yun-sik) (Lee Moon-sik) Darling, look. He's here. At our age, we should be careful of heart attack. Of course! Head director Lee is dead. And executive director is on a business trip. Well I'm the boss now. Hahah. Manager! Yes! yes... What? A loan? We'll see. Depends on you. So be good to me always. (Movie this weekend?) Welcome. May I help you? Welcome. Where's the Head Director Lee? What's the matter? Oh, I have a meeting with him. Oh I see. (Condolences) Oh, my. He's dead? How about my loan? Did he have to die today? I have to settle the remaining balance today. What are you going to do now? Hey auntie, that's too much for the dead person. Hey! Auntie? Did you just call me auntie? What kind of bank is this? Hey, did you just say auntie? Yes, then should I call you mister? - Oh my, my. - Calm down, Ms. Lee. You guys are uneducated and impolite. - It's nothing. Continue. - So are you educated and polite? Don't move! Nobody move! What's going on? Sir! What's the matter? I said nobody move! Or I will kill him. Hey, auntie! I said don't move! I have nothing to do with this. Don't move until I'm out of here. Don't move! Stay still. Put all the money, now! Hurry up! I said put the money in! Hurry up! Take all the cash out. Bring the cash. Hurry up! He is in a hurry. Hurry up. Put all the cash. And coins too. Even a cent? Take him down! Take him! Freeze. Put your hands on your head, now! (Bank Attack) (Unicef Korean Commission/ Appointment Ceremony) You must be busy with all the criminal activity that's been happening. Do you have a special reason for having a interest in unfortunate children? I feel that simply arresting the criminals can't make the society brighter. No one is born to be criminals. So it's important to make an environment to not get them involved in the crimes at young age. I heard you are going to retire after 20 years serving in the police force. And moving on to children welfare problem. You're going to suppot them. Is that true? I'm just starting to build more interest. Look at his smile. He acts like a celebrity. His show will come to the end. Such an old sly. Look, that old bastard is here too. I can smell something from them. Should we just summon and arrest them? Not yet. We should wait for a big one. Why did you come out? Stay inside. No, I'm so bored. Listen to me, or you'll get a shot at the hospital. I don't have headache anymore. What? No, give it to me! I told you, stay inside! No! I'm going to play with it. Can you please listen to me? Give it to me! (Busan Medical Center) There is a high risk of getting unconscious. Due to increasing number of capillaries. I can't be sure when is cerebral hemorrhage going happen. There's no choice except getting the surgery. What did the doctor tell you? Can I go home? I want to go home dad. Dad! What? Give me a piggyback ride. Yeon-he, do you want to sing a song? Yes. What song? 'Daddy and crayon' 'Daddy and crayon'? not 'Crayon and daddy? Let's start. 'Last night, my dad came home...' Chief! You looked great today. Hello, chief! He looks like a bar waitress, huh? What do you mean? He's looking great. You bastard! Hey! Mister, sit properly. Mister! Chief Koo! Are you kidding? Investigation is not finished. I'm gonna talk with him. Chief Koo, what's going on? Wait. Who are you? Chief Koo, I'm so sorry. I was so busy, I forgot for this month. Don't bluntly speak to me like that. It makes me difficult if you keep talking that way. I'll end this investigation. With 20 days of business suspension. 20 days? You don't like it? I can give 3 months. Why do you always eat two ramen? Hey, when are you paying the rent? There's no deposit left after this month. I'll pay after once I'm done with this work. You've been telling me that all the time. I can't let you go this time. I don't want to do this but my wife is grilling me about it. You know her temper. Okay, I got it. Oh, please. Why do you live like that? The egg should be passed quickly so that it won't get frozen. Then, the egg must protected inside male's pocket. Which is 80'c warmer than outside. Yeon-hee, did you finish eating tomatoes? What? Put that down and let's have one more, please? But, I want to eat ice-cream.. The doctor told you to eat plenty of it to get better. If I eat this, take me to the zoo. Zoo? However, this is the only way for Emperor Penguin to survive. Yeon-hee, do you want to see the penguin? Alright, I will take you to the zoo, if you eat this! Really? Yes, for real! The white pill is for your head! Good girl. Tastes bitter. And, the blue pill is to get you taller. Good girl. But, why am I not getting taller? Because you are not taking enough pills. So, you should take pill from now on. How can they just park this way? Chief... They're here. We should get them right now. Chief! Is reporter Lee here? Not yet. What if they run away? If we fail this time, the situation will get worse. Just wait for it. How about reporter Jang? We didn't tell him. What did you say! I told you media control is also one aspect of an investigation. Just wait for 5 minutes more. God sake! Drop your weapon! Bastards. These bastards are overreacting. Just stay still! Hey! Stop playing around. Let's just finish it quickly. Stay still. Chief, we got them all, right? Yes, as you can see. How did you smell the location of Kang Doo-sik? Smell? Am I a dog? Working for a month without a single break brought this result. If you come late next time, you won't get any of it. Chief! Chief! Damn, Kim Soo-hyung and Park Chul-min have escaped. What do we do? How do I know? Escort them to the station. Chief, How about those who escaped? Catch them again! Darn it. Please, help me. I'll pay you back. Only just $30,000 more... What? are you out of your mind? M..Mister.. Do.. Doesn't make sense!!! L, ,ast.. t..time. Do you like him? Why do you stammer! Just treat him like you do to me. You still haven't paid the money you owe us. I can't lend you anymore! Ah... Please, just one more time. I'm begging you. I can't believe it. Hey mister, don't do this. Please just pay off my money first, you moron. I will risk my life. Please! Please... Risk your life? hahah. (Body Disclaimer/Bae Gi-ro) It is due next month. And... For remaining debts, you have to pay before tomorrow noon. Bring me my money or your body. Got it? Okay. And keep your time. Okay. If you don't.. Just don't try it. God you are making me crazy! How can you poop that often? I can't help it. I do this all the time when I'm so nervous. Nervous? You are just eating a lot. You're nervous? Then, act like a nervous person. Pay attention and look. (Woo-ri Village Bank) What about that bank? Are you going to make an account? Go check one more time. Okay. Can I check one more time? Here you go. - Thank you. Thank you. Yes. Can I get more loans? Hey, that's enough. We can't just fool them anymore. Are you sure about the exploitation information? Of course. And by the way, what happened to the people following you? Those bastards? - Yes. - Darn it. I don't know why they keep following me. But don't worry. Just keep that files safe. It's in my private safe. Anyway, take care of yourself and don't pull me in. Please lie over here. Hahah sure. Let's go right now. No! I'm not going to the hospital. Take me to the zoo. You don't like being sick. Don't you? Let's go to the hospital and get well first. Let's go. I don't like the doctor and the niddles too. He will treat your headache and let pain go. Let's go. I don't have a headache anymore. Let's go to the zoo. Dad! Didn't you promise me? Dad. Alright let's go to the zoo first and then, the hospital. Or I'm just going to work. (Welcome to Zooland) It's going down. What should we do next? Let's go see the penguins. Penguins? Real penguins? Yes, Let's run to see them! Hurry up. (You can meet the penguin family next month) Yeon-he, the penguins are busy swimiing in the North Pole. Let's come here next time. Okay? Yeon-hee! Yeon-hee, what's wrong? Yeon.. Yeon-hee, get a hold of yourself. What's wrong? Can you see me? Yeon-hee! Open your eye! My money.. my money! Where's my money! Who are you? Nobody knows when heart attack comes. It's on his luck. I heard it was a concussion. - No, it was a heart attack. - Heart attack! Nobody knows what'll happen. So he died from a heart attack? He died naked in the sauna. I heard you two were close. Does internal affair division manages of the bank? Sort of. I guess you know better. I don't understand what you are talking about. Everything will be finished by tomorrow. Try to sleep well tonight. You'll suffer from day and night starting tomorrow. You guys stay solemn in the funeral hall. I got to go. I'm busy. Put Sang-gae dong 'Screwdriver' on Wanted list. Now. (Emergency Center) - 2 I of oxygen. - Okay. - Standard Deviation. - Okay. We can't delay the surgery anymore. Try to lend some money or do something! What a dad... I had the money to do the surgery today.. But... Sir... Can we please do the surgery first? Please do the surgery first. And I will do anything for it. I told you I don't have the authority to do that. - Doctor.. - Doctor! Emergency call from Room 11. I'm sorry. Who are you? Well. Who are you guys? Us? Can't you see this? Put that down. And get down on your knees! Listen to me! What are you doing with that knife? What are you doing? Lock the back door. Okay, bro. Hey! Put the cash in the bag. Get down! You too! I want every single coin to the bag. Move quickly! You don't understand what's going on? Put all of them. What are you doing! Put them in! If anyone press the alarm, all of you will die, okay? Stop looking and do your work! Move quickly or I'll shoot you in your head. Hey, what's that? This is for him. Are you kidding me? Put it in the bag, now! Do it quickly! Put your hands up! Open the safe! She can't open the safe. What? Not anyone can open the safe. Then, who can open it? Open it! Now! Yes, yes, yes. Open it! Move, get in there! Quickly, open it! You! dumb head, get in there. Move quickly. You bastard! What the... is this all? Yes. Put it in first. Faster! What are you looking at! Put your head down. Bro, this is all. Are you kidding? You want to die or what? We transferred everything to the head office last week. - This is all we have now… - Last week? Don't play with me. Do you think we don't know? Transferring cash is on every Monday and Thursday, An hour before the closing time. Do you guys want to die? The policy changed since last week. Due to redevelopment, deposit has decreased and the bank is moving next month... So, transferring is only once every Friday… What the? This is not what we talked about! Do you think we are fools? Where's the cash! Tell me! Right now! We don't have any. I mean it... Delivery guy. Come here. Sorry, I have delayed deliveries to go…. Don't make me speak twice! You bastard! I'm busy too! Think you're having a bad luck today. Darling! - Holly! -When are you done? 3 minutes have passed already. You didn't lock the front door? - You didn't tell me to do it. - We have to pull out the car! Just get out, get out! - What are you doing? - Just keep watching outside. Darn it! This is taking whole day. I'm asking you for the last time. Where's the cash? We really don't have it. I mean it. Darn it! They don't have the cash! Let's just leave with it now! No! Okay, if you die, at least, somebody will tell me. Please, there's no cash. Please save me. If you need more, I'll give you mine… Everyone, take out your wallet. Take all your wallets out, hurry up. What the! Don't touch it! Darn it! - What is this! - This is mine! I was here first! Bastard, do you want to die? It's mine! I came here first! Manager… that is… Hey don't move! They are just so slow. How can they rob the bank? Police! Damn, the police is here! We have to go now. Darling! The Police is here! They have guns! Don't move! Damn it! Let me go. Wait a minute. Let me go! Are they really doing their job? What's the case? It's robbery! - Where? - Woo-ri Village Bank at Poongsan! At Poongsang? Thanks god. The arrant got out just in time. Under the name of police, illegal loan and illeagal speculation… Sly old fox… His career ends today. What is going on? Darling! Darling! Get up! Darling, please, get up. You bastard…. I didn't do it. Darling.. You bastard! No. I didn't kill him! Please get up. - Give me the bag - Move! You crazy. I can't believe it. Damn! Let me go. Get out! Stop following me, you bastard! We're doomed. This is police! You are under siege! Drop your weapons and surrender immediately! I repeat! This is police! You are under siege! Drop your weapons and surrender immediately! We are doomed... You're under siege. If you guys are under siege. It is best to surrender quickly… Shut up! Don't move. I'm still here. If anyone moves, I'll kill you all. I said don't move! Stop! What are you doing! Get your hands off! Get your hands off! Give me that bag. Put the gun down. I came here first. So give me that bag. Okay, take it! Bastard. What can you do with that money? Police is everywhere. You dumb head. I knew this will happen… This isn't what I planned… This is not… At 9AM, 2 males has attempted to rob the bank, but failed. 6 or 7 bank employees are held as hostages. 2 males? Yes. There was a gunshot when came to the scene. So there's a possibility of causality. Reporter Lee and Jang will be arriving soon. Why did you call them? What is wrong with you! We have a warrant, but we can't go in. Why this happens today? Damn it. Look at his face. He must feel frustrated. Those bastards! Hey! Where's the toilet? Toilet? It's outside through that back door. I told you to just bring me that file! Not to rob the bank! That's not the situation. - What are you doing! - What? Where's the file? Not yet. A gun! gun! Hey, who told you can make phone call! Take out all your phones, now! Dad... Dad... Are you awake? Your dad will be here soon. Where's the guardian? I don't know. He told me he'll be back soon. We don't have enough bed! It's not a ward here. - Call her guardian right now! - Okay. This command center looks miserable. Does it had to be here? It's embarassing. Whose idea was this? - Where's the SWAT team? - They'll arrive in 5 minutes. - Secure the invasion route. - Okay. As soon as recognizing the criminals' identities, - Contact with their associates! - Okay. How could you make this in a snack car… As soon as SWAT team arrives, should we go in? Going in is not a big deal. Then? I'm thinking. - Chief! It's me reporter Lee. - You can't just go in. - Please just a word! - Step back. Chief! It's me reporter Lee. Chief! I have to get out of here. Yeon-hee is waiting for me. What a surprise on Monday morning. Explain the situation. Well. There is nothing much to say. Have you talked with hostages? We are setting a hotline at the moment. There's a number at the sign over there. Hey, don't waste the time. As soon as SWAT squad arrives, everything will be clear. If we make a hasty decision, we'll get the blame for everything. To minimize the damage, it's best to lure them out, We should pretend we're following their terms. Everyone is watching us. Anyway, let's do it quickly. I'm retiring after two days. What am I doing here! Should I get the call? Don't move! I said don't move! We're not in a theater. Then, what should I do? At least, we should turn off either one. Hello, this is Lee Hyun-jung from Pong-san branch. He wants to talk to you. What? You.. you get the phone. Why me? You were here first. Take it. Ah.. Damn it! Seems like they can't get the call right now. They're asking what are your terms. Our terms? Yes, we have hostages. Nothing can't stop me now! - Yeon hee's surgery... - I don't need anything! After the death, money is worthless! I'm out. I'm going out with my darling. Where are you going? You bastard! You killed my darling! Right? What is going on? They are going out. Are they joking or what? They might surrender. Tell them to stay in there! Hello? What are they asking? Those bastards.. They say they are going to kill everyone. What? Who said they will surrender? That's a bullshit! She said they will! I'm out. I'm going out with my darling! Do whatever you want. I'm out.. What did he say? He says don't move and stay in here. - Hey, you! - Yes. Bring one more bullet-proof jacket. There's nothing left. Then, take off yours! You're not going in anyway. Take it off! Quickly! - Chief, what's going on? - Why are you going in? Did you make any deal with hostage takers? chief! I'm chief Koo Sung-han! I'm unarmed! Once I check the safety of hostages, I will accept all your terms. I'm going in! Who is that? What is he trying to do? That's full of crap. Hey, what are you doing? I will tell him the terms. Are you crazy? You don't know what he's gonna do. Do you have any better idea? It is better than doing nothing. Don't think too much. All of you can die. Calm down. I'm here to help you. Hello, we have met before with the head director. Damn! Don't move! Thanks for the support. Cheer up. Darling.. This is worse than I expected. What's your plan? Who's the leader? you? Or you? Not me! How can you just leave him like this? If the police see this body, it'll be disadvantageous to you. They will come in as soon as they find out. What are you doing? Move the body. That room seems good. Mister, you look strong. Move him inside, quickly! I have to talk with these guys. Never! Don't you ever touch him! I will kill everyone! Take her outside. She's too noisy. Don't touch him, you bastards... You see, my heart is very weak.. Leave me! I'm not going out! Did he just save one hostage as soon as he got in? Wow, he's good. What are you doing! I'm innocent. Why! Are you threatening us? Don't you understand the situation? Not a threat. I'm making a deal. What deal? I never expected to see dead body. What an unlucky day. The penalty for robbing a bank is heavier than you think. One person is dead already. I didn't kill him. It was an accident, a light bulb fell off from the ceiling. Hey, say something about it! Didn't you notice anything weird from that detective? Maybe, he's using a complicated negotiation skill. Like breaking down their wariness. Since he was close with headirector Lee, he won't be normal. You watched too many movies. Approving a helicopter escape will never be possible. After all, there's no place for the landing. And, don't even think about escaping with a car. Do you think the police will let you just drive away? Waving their hands? As soon as you get out, they will shoot you down right away. See, it's a threat. I remember him. He was here before. Acting violent. He came here a few days ago to get a loan. Why didn't you just give him the loan? You told me not to since he's unqualified. When did I? If you surrender now, I'll help you guys out and lighten the penalty. And, you! They look like amateurs. Your daughter needs the surgery. Your daughter can get her surgery and. I get my dignity as an UNICEF ambassador. This is a great deal for both of us. So you lost your gas gun from the amateurs. You're worthless. Can you assure that my daughter will get her surgery? Of course. Don't believe him. The police never keeps their promise! It's all crap! A crap? how dare you.. Were you fooled for your entire life? Yes! I've been fooled for my entire life. Don't be so picky. Okay? We don't have much time. So, don't hurt any hostage. For just an hour. I will contact you soon. And wrap up this situation peacefully, okay? What the... Hey, what took you so long? What did you do in there? I have a stomachache so.. Sit down. Quickly! Keep the promise. If you don't, I will kill you. Alright. Detective! you can't leave like this. Auntie, I said don't move! Don't worry. Just calm down and wait a little bit longer. Hey, how about me? Are you crazy? Sit, sit down! If we put all our efforts towards the goal, In the end, we will be able to achieve our goal. Once a crime happens, there is always a spot inspection. And all the truths will be revealed. Everyone must keep his own role. But if we fail, there's a price for not keeping the role. Let's live life to the full! - He's coming out. - Everyone, keep down! Step back! As soon as the surgery starts, they promised to release hostage one by one every 10 minutes. - Will you keep the promise? - Of course. Why don't you use SWAT team to repress them? Crime is sinful, but human is innocent. For our hostages and painful Yeon-hee who is struggling, the children foundation where I belonged will help to solve this peacefully. What will happen If they don't keep the promise? That won't be the case… Then, the situation will get worse. One more question, Chief! Please answer! Please explain the details of the situation.. He's totally in his element. Do we stand by? Hey, are we looked down? I think so. - Doesn't answer our call? - No, sir. I told him not to run away from us but he did, right? That's right, sir. Go and bring him right now. Okay. Why are you not leaving? Where should we go? I don't know where he… Do I have to teach you everything? You idiots! Please think on your own before acting! At least, bring her daughter, okay? Yes, boss. I ordered it so long ago. Why are you coming now? Darling, have some coffee before you go! Try to contact UNICEF. I promoted your hospital a lot already. Okay, please hurry. We are waiting. What did they say? Can he do for us? Thank God! Detective Kim! Yes! Go to the hospital first, and people from the foundation will be there soon. Report to me as soon as the surgery starts. Okay! Gosh. What if they change their mind later? Just make an order, and I can suppress in 10 minutes. Guns can't solve the problem. Don't you learn anything from Chief Koo? Chief, let's speak inside. Damn! Make a scared face! Take off your hat and tremble your body! Put your head up straight! Is he bald? I knew it. Damn it! You scared me! You should have told me! I thought your entire scalp was gone! Bastard! Hey, delivery guy. Come over here. I just did. Do it again, damned bastard! Damn it. Is he sleeping? Hey, bastard! This isn't your place! No one is here. I already broke one side. Don't do it again. Don't push me! I said don't push me! What is this smell… This place is nasty. What can we do now? Let's use our brain before acting. Brain… (Medicine for Bae Yeon-hee Busan Medical Center) Oh, you followed me until here? You are so lucky. Robbery happend on the day like this. We can't even enter using the arrest warrant. I'll give this bulletproof jacket and try to go in. Kim Ki-sun from the bank, Kim Ki-hoon from the casino and Jang Mi-suk for smuggling business… What do you think they have in common? How the hell do I know that? I know you don't risk for such danger… If you destruct the evidence, you'll be in more trouble. If you're that free, can you guys help restricting people, instead? They can't kill people. Then, what is that dead man in there? Didn't you see for yourself? They didn't intend it. I was just an accident. We can die from more accidents then. I'm going out after the closing hour. Mister! It's lunchtime. She's in a critical condition that needs to get surgery immediately. There's the Detective! - Right now.. - Hey! Hey! Stop! - Let us in! - No, you can't enter! Come over here! What? Where is she? Isn't this kidnapping? Kidnapping? That's taking away kid to get money. We are taking away the kid to get money. We are asking for the payback, so this is not kidnapping. Oh, then this isn't a kidnapping because we're asking for the payback. I don't know. You dumb! Stop confusing me! Sir. Did you notice anyone inside when you got in there? What do you mean? Sang-gae dong 'Screwdriver'! Why is he there? 'Screw-Driver'? What? You arrested him by yourself! You don't know him? Well, I arrested too many people. Hello. Chief, Yeon-hee is missing. What do you mean? Did he lie about it? No, she was here. But she just disappeared. What should I do? Block all the reporters and don't tell this to anyone. - Wait at the hospital for now! - Yes. Damn it, what the hell is going on? Damn it. What's wrong with this? Hey, why aren't you coming out? Yes, yes…. Almost… I'm almost done. Oh, it's done! It's coming out! Hurry! Chief, I have to go to the hospital immediately. Why? There's a problem about the girl's surgery. I'll go there by myself and solve the problem at the hospital. Give me an hour. Then, what about the scene? That's not important now. Starting the surgery is the priority. Remember. Don't do the armed suppression. If any of hostages gets injured, the media will blame on us like crazy. Step aside. Excuse me. I'm sorry. You can't enter. Please go back. I'm here for the delivery. What the hell are they? People ordered food from the inside. Seriously… Move quickly! Who's going to pay? The police will pay! Hey, get the receipt. This is actually a better chance for us. They will be unsettled while eating. We need to talk. Look at you. How can you eat the food in this situation? Diet rule number one, 'never skip the meal no matter what.' Don't you know it? Well... Diet? I can't believe it. There's the reason why she's special. I don't know what's going on, but, let's eat. Don't you have a stomachache? Eating is eating. It's a separate thing. I have to eat a lot to prevent me from getting fooled by the police. Damn. What are you looking at? Eat. Hey, bring Palbochae to me. I also smelled something strange. The safecracker is inside the bank. A safecracker... The whole story makes sense. Chief Koo doesn't care about the case, hostages or anything. He's dragging time to take the evidence away from inside. So, what do you want me to do? You should go in and suppress them right now. Don't you think so? I need to find that evidence quickly before. Chief Koo takes the evidence away. So we're on the same boat. Come and eat first. They won't bother us while we're eating. Don't worry. I'm good. You should eat. Come and eat before that guy finishes all the food. Please sit down and eat. Have some of this too. But, where's your wife? She died from the accident. It must've been hard for you. I know that very well because I also raised my kid alone. What are the police doing outside? When does the surgery start? Is that really hard to do? What if the hospital refuses? They are obsessed with money. Not all the people are like you. Lady, watch your mouth. You heard that it's because of the surgery schedule. They will start in a minute. This is too salty! I'm done. Damn! I hate tomatoes in the food! Yeon-hee… Chief! The kid is missing from the hospital. What? Yes, much time has passed already. Why are you telling me now? I just heard from reporters and checked with the hospital. Chief Koo ordered them not to tell anyone about it. Is that why he rushed to the hospital? What should we do? How long does it take to get ready? 10 minutes only. We don't have a choice. Change to plan B! You are in charge of the situation now. Yes, sir. They might know with the hostage takers. Stop the video! Sir! You should get back to the scene quickly. Why? They're going in to suppress… Damn it! I said no armed suppression! There is no other way! Wait until I get there. Why didn't you tell me that she was missing? How can you find her? Shut up and come back here, now! Hello? Hello! Damn, this isn't good at all. Mister, I can give you a medicine for stomachache. Chief! (Lends You the Money with Low Interest) I can search for the girl by myself. I can open this. I can do this. I must open this. Darling, stop tickling me. - Okay. I won't tickle you. - Okay. Duck... Duck! Hey, I didn't say "Goose" yet! You caught me at the wrong timing. Bank robber Bae Gi-ro is holding hostages, - and his daughter Bae Yeon-hee - Darling, what are you doing? - Has disappeared from the hospital. - Say Goose quickly. Why? Bae Gi-ro did it for Yeon-hee's surgery... Boss, we brought her! Who is she? So cute. Put her back. - What? - You told us to take her at least. These nuts! Can't you see that? That news? Are you trying to destroy my life? Look at all the fuss you made because you took her! The police will be everywhere if we go back now… Then, put her back in any hospital! Do it know! I knew this would happen, bastards! What's wrong? They are trying to come in, damn it! What? You fool. We're doomed. Come over here. Get down! Go down now! How about Yeon-hee's surgery? Everything was a lie? Can't you see what's going on? Do you think they will care about us? Damn it. I'm going to kill everyone! What was the plan? How could you get fooled without getting in? I thought you were confident. I planned on secret infiltration operation… Shut up! If the problem happens about my retirement, you are dead! Where's Chief Koo? When is he coming? Did he go somewhere? Why? Don't try to bother or disturb us. How can I leave that corrupt police pretending like a hero? Hey! You can't call us corrupt police! You're corrupt too! If you keep screening him, you'll get suspected too. What? We are poorly paid and worked for 24 hours for 20 years. We always get injured. Not having a single house or a proper family. Corruption? That's total crap, bastard. Don't you ever talk like that again before me. Hello? Ah. Okay. We are on our way. See you. Chief, the plan has failed. Luckily, there's no damage. See? I told you that it wouldn't be easy. (Unknown) - Hello? - Hello? Chief, It's me. Hello? Hello? What is this? Damn it. Hey, where did I put the name card? Damn it. You bastard! You were suspicious. Are you here to rob the bank as well? Is he training us like a dog? Why is he robbing the bank? He's pathetic. We were too harsh to him. You are more pathetic. Cut the crap and let's look for the hospital. Why is it so hard to find? Borrowing some money? Our address is... Damn it. I'm going to show them what I can do! You go first. Who's next? Pick one. Hello, everything's fine? Fine? What are you guys doing? Are you joking with me? I'm sorry. There was a little confusion on our side. This will never happen again. Are you lying about the surgery? No, it's not like that. What happened to Yeon-hee? What's going on? She's getting ready for the surgery at the hospital. We can't do anything with the hospital's schedule. Please understand that. Put Chief Koo on the phone. I'm going to talk with Chief Koo. He's at the hospital for your daughter's surgery. Everything is working as we promised. Please wait for a bit. The time he promised has already passed. Tell him to call me now. If he doesn't call me in 30 minutes, I have no choice. Think wise. Don't take that card. This time, it's a full house. This is police! Everyone get down, don't move! Get them now! It hurts. - Don't kill us. - Let me go. Let me go. What? Damn it. Where's the kid? Who are you? - Line them up. - Okay. You bastard. Hey! Where is the kid? The kid? I never kidnapped the kid. Look at you. I didn't say about any kidnapping. Hey, didn't you put her back? We did… - Turn right - No, turn left. I… I remember that sign. That's bull shit. You didn't drive the car. I did! Stop fooling around! I apologize, sir. You bastard, tell him exactly! Now! (Waiting Number 002) I shouldn't have come to this suburb bank. Darling… Darling…. Dong-hoon…. Everyone shut up! The number that I hate the most! Number 4! You! You are the next! - What are you doing! - Give that to me! You can't do this to me! Give it to me! Sir! Sir! I beg you. Please don't kill me. I have my kids and old mother to take care. What will happen to my family if I die? Damn it! You want to die first? - No. - Sit down straight. (Gaya Animal Hospital) You bastard! Bastards! How could you leave the kid at the animal hospital? You bastard are like the animals! Sorry, they lack intelligence. Can we go now? Go! Let's go to the police station. What? Mr. Bae! This is Jang! From now on! I'll discount tomatoes… No! No! I'll give them for free! Mr. Bae! Can't you hear me? Please surrender! Can't you hear me? Is this good? Put the microphone down! - More? - Yes! Okay. Oh, my. Mr. Bae! Please don't do this! Come out! Think about Yeon-hee! This isn't right! Let's find her back and do the surgery! You were just about to get shot! You know that? What does he mean? Is Yeon-hee missing? My Yeon-hee… What are you doing to me? Leave me! Don't touch her! She's just a woman! Leave me! Stop! Let me go! Why are you doing this? Why! Put the gun away! Where's my daughter! - He's out. - The criminal has come out. Where is my daughter! Bae Gi-ro! Don't do this. Your daughter is being transferred to the hospital! What do you mean by Yeon-hee is missing? Tell me! The moneylender you transacted took Yeon-hee. But Chief Koo found her and taking her to the hospital! She'll arrive soon and get the surgery! Why didn't you tell me! Why? Because if you knew, we know that you will rage like this! Bring Chief Koo to me now! And tell him to talk to me directly! Okay! Okay! Please calm down! Just shut up and bring him! Or else, I'll do something. What do you mean you can't pay for the surgery? What? Dr. Kim! Dr. Kim! Dr. Kim! The public opinion is not good. The hostage situation is getting worse too. Even though we're welfare group, we can't ignore that. We really wanted to help. I'm sorry about that… Damn! Waiting for what? It's all over. I can't wait anymore, damn it! I need to listen from Chief Koo. No, I'm checking with my eyes at the hospital! What does that have to do with me! I'm going out! Come here! - Come here! - Please save my life! Please! My child will be sent to an orphanage! He can't live without me! Please! Come out! Wait! You bastard. What are you doing? Check the situation! Okay. Get in! - Is she getting the surgery? - Probably. Is Child-hope foundation where you belong to paying for the surgery? Well… Yes, that's right. How could you satisfy the criminal's terms with an exchange for hostages' life? Every life is same and equally important. She is an innocent child. I will make sure all hostage are safe, as well as Yeon-hee. - Chief, we have more questions! - Chief, one more question! Come out! - This is embarrassing - Come out quickly! Stop right there! Freeze! Put your hands up! Move! Take him! It's weird. I saw 'Screwdriver' inside. Extremely dehydrated symptom. He needs some rest at the hospital now. Check his identity, and hold him at the hospital. Okay. We have no choice. So what? This is the final method. Final? You just failed! How can you say that? We already have victims. We can't wait for more sacrifices. Wait for Chief Koo! Everyone is looking for him! But what can he do about the situation? Do you know why he's working so hard today? Yes, we are on our way to the hospital. I'll call you back. Are you okay? Stay still. Are you okay? Can you go out first and check my daughter if she's getting the surgery? I'm begging you. Why should I? You know how serious kidnapping is. Think of this your attorney fee and do something good. $30K? $4K-$5K is enough for the attorney fee. Press the number now. (Song Ji-man $30K) Then, you promise me this time… In the future, you will pass over at least 2 times… No, at least 3 times! Stop dragging the time. Then, twice! Or once! No! (Transfer Done To Busan Medical Center) I'm letting you off very lightly this time. Be nice and take small interest! Get well! You're not going to kill us, are you? I'm sorry about what just happened. I had no choice. Everyone, don't worry. You will be safe. It's good that we didn't work today. Right? When can we experience like this situation? That's not true. I told you we'll all be okay. Ms. Lee, we can go out together! Cheer up. We're fine, but don't give up on her. I understand how it feels when our child gets sick. Please wait inside the room and stay until everything is done. Can you stay here alone? It's dangerous. The police will attack you right away when we get inside. Everyone can get dangerous in here. I'm leaving for the hospital soon. Wait inside until then. Yes, let's follow what he says. Yeah, let's go inside. Hey, never give up. Today... I'm sorry for everything. (Operating Room) Excuse me! What? Hey... It's me. Koo Sung-han. The time already passed. What happened? It's not my fault that the moneylender took your daughter. The operation has just started, so it's all over. Surrender quietly when I arrive. I want to check with my eyes. Hey, you know it's not a simple situation. The police will never let you go to the hospital. I won't believe it before I check with my eyes I worked really hard to find her to make her get the surgery. This is different from what we promised! You made me do this! You didn't keep the promise first! Come here and take me to the hospital! I want to see her first. Then, you can take me. Hello? Hello! What an ignorant man... Speed up! Damn it... You can have the surgery without me, right? You'll be fine without me, right? Can you wait for a bit? Dad is going there now. Daddy... Where are you... Ah? - I'm scared... - Yeon-hee... I don't want to be alone. Yeon-hee... When are you coming, dad? Come here... Daddy... Daddy... Come here... You were late. Again! Rock, scissors, paper! I won! Yeon-hee. I'm sorry… Dad is sorry… Daddy is going there soon... Yeon-hee… Go in! Approach to the target. One target is missing! Check the outside! Move to the scene! Stop operational situation! What's going on with him? What's going on with him? Don't kill him! He's not a bad person! Bae Gi-ro! Put the gun down! Don't move or he'll die! - Everything is over! - Don't move! Hey! Come over here! You're 'Screwdriver'! Right? - Are you the 'Screw Driver'? - No! Not yet! Chief Koo promised me! I'm going to the hospital! I have to go to see Yeon-hee. Get the car ready! Hurry up! He's going out! Get the car ready! The target is heading out. The target is heading out. Sniper, get to your position. Sniper, get to your position. Target aimed. Target aimed. Sniper, get to your position. Sniper, get to your position. Secure the sight! Secure the sight! Damn! Can't wait for a minute! Hey, Bae Gi-ro, are you okay? Bae Gi-ro! Wake up! Wake up! Hey! Call the ambulance! Come over here, now! Bae Gi-ro, get up now! Yeon-hee is waiting! You should go to her now! Bae Gi-ro! Wake up, wake up! Yeon-hee... My Yeon-hee... You have to see Yeon-hee... My Yeon-hee... Block all the press and civilians and check the scene. Okay. There's nothing. Damn it... (Loan Trade Agreement) What the... This makes me look funny. Better than going to the jail. Did you finish the work? I had no choice in the bank. They were using guns. I know. Did you open the safe? Of course! But I almost died. Don't lie. I opened it while risking my life! You did it every day. But, what's that file about? You don't have to know. You shouldn't know. If that file is revealed, you are in trouble, right? You bastard! Right? Shut up! Chief, what should we do with that kid? Why? Are you going to raise her? No! I set everything in advance. What? You've changed!
