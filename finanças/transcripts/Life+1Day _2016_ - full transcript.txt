Somayeh, don't throw that one away, she'll come back and raise hell! She was wearing her father's pants up until last year- - and now she's covered this with it, to show how creative she is! She's inherited her poverty from her parents. You can't change her. And you shouldn't get annoyed This is the last one, me and Azam will bring the rest. Hurry up! Look I had thrown this out, she's sewed it back together for possibly 30th time. What if someone sees our poor brother in school with this?! And when it comes to hoarding junk she is afraid of you! Look, a banana! She hides it for a rainy day. It's gone bad- - But if you tell her, she'll eat it just to prove you wrong! Somayeh, I'm running late, let's take these out before she comes. Just a second. There's trash everywhere. Dried bread! She's collecting the whole neighborhood's dried bread! Drop it in here. Somayeh she's here! I'm gone for two seconds, you throw away my whole life! Azam, help Somayeh out. Somayeh, can I leave? Azam! Stop eating everyone else's leftovers, it's just grease. It's not greasy! That's why you're always sick. Navid wake Leila up so she comes and eats her dinner. I don't want her waking us up in the middle of the night. I will in a second. Who is he talking to with such excitement?! Moneza, answer me, should I reheat your dinner? He's gotten a taste of eating out with that girl, he doesn't eat at home. Stop teasing him, he'll say something. What did I say?! Mom, give this to Navid, he didn't eat anything. Don't do that mom. We have enough leftovers. Don't worry, food will never go to waste in our house. You make me sick, we're eating here! There's a sore inside. It'll bleed if I don't. Don't play around with it. You want tuna or beans? I hate tuna, make me an omelette. Eggs aren't healthy at night. Want me to reheat some rice? Rice with what? There's bread, pickles, salad, there's also my food, untouched. I don't eat leftovers. Let it go mom, I'll make an omelette. Azam, don't bother helping Somayeh out. These cartoons are ridiculous. It was much better back in our days. Somayeh this is out of water again. Thank you Somayeh. Enjoy. Tomorrow let's convince Moneza to visit Mohsen, so they don't think he doesn't have anyone. One cup isn't enough for mom. Plus that water is too warm. Somayeh... Sweetie, why are you crying? I saw dad's photos and lost it. Oh sweetie, why?! My photos of them don't come out, can I take a few? Which ones do you want? The ones with dad in them. Look at how lovely they are. We were all doing good when he was around. Take whichever ones you like. No reason to cry over. I thought you were sad because of your marriage. No. I got sad when I saw these. Did you really get married with this guy? Or is mom making it up? She's right. Why do it so quietly? I don't even know what I've done. You regret it? I don't know. Did Moneza force you to? No, he just said if you don't want to let me know- So we don't waste their time. If you didn't want to, then why did you get married? It's a temporary marriage, for a month. Wise move. Did they give you any gifts? His mom gave me this, and his sister this. Is it gold? I don't know. You want me to have Moneza call it off? You shouldn't get involved. Did you bring anyone anything from Kish Island? Not for everyone. Just a few. I got you something! If I tell you something, promise not to tell anyone? I promise. Once I get back from Dubai my car will be delivered. What car? I registered for a Peugeot 206. They deliver it in early March. We only live once right?! You did the right thing. Congratulations! Navid Come take this for mom. I don't want to see you cry again. Okay. No way! Ten years?! Has everybody eaten? They arrested everyone. Who did they get now? You were saying... What're you saying? Here we go again. My heart's pounding, Moneza. That girl is saying she'll kill herself if he doesn't marry her! Her father's local research revealed that- They won't find anyone better than us! Mohsen opened the door for him! Let me call you back. Bye. Shush isn't enough? You want me to ask you to shut up? Silence. Enough with the flirting, tell us what happened? Everyone, they arrested all the drug peddlers, Gholam's son, he got 10. 10 years in prison? For what? Meth. I swear to God you have to thank me. If I hadn't taken Mohsen to rehab, He would've been one of them. We'd be dealing with courts and crap. They entered all their homes. Is there a guarantee that they won't come to ours? She's right, how would they know we took Mohsen to camp? Somayeh, Mohsen doesn't keep anything in the house does he? I don't know. Why not?! I haven't even been in his room since they took him. He has pipes in his room. Oh God! Navid, wear this. Look This has been on for who knows how long. I was wondering where that cartoon sound was coming from. Somayeh how can we clean these up? You can't clean those. Throw them all away. Oh God! Navid Take this. It's over there. We'll have mom use it to make ice! These are more incriminating than the drugs. You can scrape a shit load of meth from these. Leila, check down there, make sure there's nothing. These are all dirty, if I touch them I'll get hives all over! Tear off that curtain Morteza. Take it easy Morteza! Don't take-it-easy him. Get back down if you don't want to be here. Let's first make sure he doesn't have any drugs. Enough with you clowning. Just go to bed. Yeah, I've had enough. Did you find anything? This room in itself is a thing! Somayeh, I'm leaving, want anything? Wait, take this out with you. I'll take it. Navid, go walk her to her place and come back. Take these out quietly so mom doesn't find out. Yeah if she finds out, she'll have me wash these- - Then she'll mend these holes and say look, just like new! Later sis. Bye. Bye. Somayeh I didn't say it in front of mom, but they arrested- - Her uncle's grandson with a kilo, he's a gonner. Can you not be so excited when you tell me these things?! Let's hope they release him. Can't I just share the news with you? Did you find your ID card? I didn't have time to, I will tomorrow. Find it already, before it becomes a hassle. Haven't heard from Shahnaz in a couple of week. I think she got over moving back to Tehran. Don't worry, she'll be back here in no time- And becomes another mouth to feed. No I'm sure it's nothing. She just get homesick. Moneza, Leila gets up in the mornings on her own and goes to work. Don't be so naive. They' re scared, they're getting their act together. Leila showers only once a day instead of three. And Mohsen is in rehab. Mohsen didn't go to rehab, I dragged him there. Why are you saying all this? If someone hears us they think I forced you to marry him. I really didn't think they would get scared. But... Why do you think they're scared? We're all a bunch of losers. The second you break it off with Nazir they will be their old selves. It's all a scheme. If we knew how to scheme we wouldn't live like this. Mark my words, they just want to keep you from leaving. Are you getting married just to scare them? No. Then what? You didn't say Nazir won't get a place in Tehran. So what? He told you before signing. To be in Tehran for what? To serve them on a daily basis?! Go. Live your life. It's gone. They've taken it. Who would have a use for Somayeh's ID? You go ahead. I'll find it bythe time you're back from the store. Look, Ifixed it, it'sjust like new! Toulikhanloo, if I catch you again I'll tear your paper. I'm sorry sir. Navid. Navid. Number3 in multiple choices. 2. Fill in the blank here. This one. Let me see your paper again. Navid, number 5. Why can't you sit still? I've been asking to leave for an hour. We only started 20 minutes ago How can I test Moradi if I let you go? What can I do sir? Your handwriting sucks because you write so fast. It's always a pain to correct your papers. I'm sorry sir, I'll take my time from now on. I'm sorry sir. Nice of you to show up. You can go. Thank you, sir. Tell your parents your grades will come in on the 22nd. Make sure they don't call or come in before then. Foun I'm sorry, it'll only take a minute. I'll be right there. Your name. Somayeh Toulikhanloo. What did you study? Sewing. I know, professional or introductory? Introductory. When were here? 2005. What took you so long? I'm sorry, didn't get around to it. Who did you study with? With Ms. Mousavi. 2005, Somayeh Toulikhanloo. Go ahead and sign this receipt. Write that the original document was received. Then sign your name.

I would be embarrassed. - Education: High School Diploma - Mom, it would be embarrassing! - Field of Study: Sewing Why?! Field of Study: Sewing Approval of the committee, number 214. Somayeh, I'm going to take a shower, can you make my breakfast? Dated 2013. Why aren't you at work? I fell asleep. Didn't you set your alarm? Yeah, but I didn't take my pills, fell asleep in the morning. Forget showering, it's not too late, you can still go. I'm looking into a newjob. This one was only paying $150 a month. You mean you don't want to go back? If I didn't secure a well paying job, You can use me as an excuse to go wherever you like. You've come all this way, at least come in to say hi. If I come in he'll start his shenanigans and ask me to take him home. I don't have the patience for it. You go ahead. Take this. Don't even tell him l'm here. Okay. Don't take too long. How can he escape? You charged us $160! You're right, but Mr. Moneza has paid us less than half. We can give you a refund, or if you want. Or we'll come and arrest him again for free. You bet your ass you have to rearrest him for free. Everyone else pays in installments, why shouldn't I? You're the one complaining. Why don't you have a security guard at your door? Who said we don't? Then how did he run away? Your brother's clothes. Thank you. Take this. Unbelievable! I've seen many rehab centers in my days, But none as negligent as this one. Mr. Morteza, you've gone to rehab yourself you should know better. Whoever wants to leave will leave. Nothing will stop him. Your brother didn't want to go clean. He didn't and left. You can leave these here. Sir. Come here. Thanks. Soda? Yes. Black or orange? Doesn't matter. I'm sorry. Sir... We're together. Here. Why won't you pick up when Nazir calls? You gave him my number? I shouldn't have? I don't answer numbers that I don't recognize. I'm sorry sir... I'll text you his number, save it, and answer his calls. Moneza, you never installed a ventilator. It stinks in the house, drive us crazy. I will. What is it? Mohsen is back at home? I don't know. Why is Leila constantly calling you? Please Moneza, go easy on him. He's doing his best. His best is ageing us. For my sake, don't bring it up. Okay, fine. Should we take one for mom? One? Who would eat it who would watch?! Either we buy for everyone or no one. Then forget it, it'll cost too much. Look, there's nothing to it. Just 4 pretty dishes. And everything is neatly chopped up. People are loving it. Each sandwich costs him peanuts. I've calculated it, it's a 200% profit It's tasty though. The taste mainly comes from the sauce. Otherwise it's just pickles, lettuce, tomatoes. This is really good. Did you try it? One for me. Let go of those. Come here and let's throw away the ones that are expired. The ones that have a few days left we'll take home. The ones that have a few months left someone will come and take away. What are these? Expired. You poor thing! These are all expired?! Most of them are expired only by three or four days. Let me take them home, I'm sure they're fine. I haven't purchased anything for6 months. Still so much left. Don't worry about it. Take these home too. Look at these tomatoes, the potatoes, onions. I'm selling them at a loss, half the street vendor's, but people still shop there. From the day Mohsen set foot in this store it lost its blessing. Mohsen claims that he doesn't sell drugs from here. Bullshit. People have seen him do it and that's why they won't shop here. It's all your guys' fault. You asked me to bring him here so he stops selling. Did he? He turned this place into a house of drugs! Hopefully one day you'll have enough money to change the store. I'll change it, but I won't let Mohsen near it. You already found a place? Yeah, I'm waiting for this guy to take these away. Then I'm going to check out some other places. Out of this hood. What're you doing? Just take all of them to mom she'll make tomatoe paste. Can't we take the non-expired products to the new store? I'll only need ketchup and soda. This time around I want to open a self-service falafel shop. Like the one we went to last night. You know how? I'll learn. lt'sjust chickpeas. You decided this because we went there last night? We've been going there for two months. I've been checking them out. They make a lot of money. We? Who have you been going with? Stop this. Go separate the healthy potatoes and onions and take them to mom. Somayeh? Test it out. See if it's like the ones we eat out. I'm sure it's even better! Test it out. See if it's like the ones we eat out. Yes. Your sauce is ready too. Great, we'll have these for lunch. Mom, see if you like this. Let me put this under you, it's cold. Moneza, if everyday you fended off the evil eyes in your store this wouldn't happen. Slow down. Is it clogged again? It got worse. What did you do? Step aside. Use a stick to unclog it. Navid. Navid. Navid come here. I want to use the bathroom. Hurry! Hi. Repeat. Moneza. Moneza. What? Are you wearing brother Mohsen's sandals? Are you wearing brother Mohsen's sandals? It's here. Don't you know brother Mohsen hates it when someone else wears his sandals? Don't you know brother Mohsen hates it when someone else wears his sandals? I'm coming. Hurry UP- He said he's coming. Hurry UP- Here. Somayeh. Somayeh. What? Who did this to my room? I did, Is it bad? What did you do with my belongings? What belongings? It was trash. I threw it away. A scale that costs $50 is trash? Keeping a scale in the house is a crime, I threw it away. Look here, I have a customer who wants 45 grams. How am I going to measure it now? I have to take 5 grams off of this. 45 grams of what? Of whatever. Somayeh, is that meth he's holding? Now you see what happens when you beg me to not say anything to him? Mohsen, what if they catch you? Didn't you swear you'll stop? It's just this. I want to sell it so I don't get tempted. Didn't we search everywhere? Where was this?! Moneza your falafel is burning. Who do plan on selling all this to? A customer. Do you know him? No, he got my number from a friend. Give the whole thing to him? What do you want to leave 5 grams in the house? 5 grams alone gets you 5 years. Alright, you do your thing. Moneza, It's burning up. I'm coming. Somayeh, don't let him leave with that. No drugs. Mohsen, don't take that with you. - Don't let him take that with him. - Okay okay. Two packs of Kents. Two phone credits. And this is for you. Somayeh has asked me to not buy cigarettes. Somayeh told you? I swear to God. Navid, come here. Do you get annoyed when I call you? No. Then why did you just leave without my permission? I'm sorry. Two phone credits. A pack of straws and a small gas capsule. And this is for you. You could have asked Moneza to bring you these from our own store. Moneza has asked me to not go to the store for straws, gas and lighters. What else has Moneza said? He said you should buy whatever you want yourself and not send me. Okey. This is for you. Mom said I can ask Moneza for money. Mom said what? Moneza, Somayeh! Did he hit you, Navid? Dickhead! Let go of him! Asshole! What the hell is wrong with you?! You've brainwashed this little brat. So much that even he doesn't respect me anymore. If you touch him one more time I will choke you to death. Two packs of Kents. A gas capsule, a pack of straws, phone credit and gas capsule, bring back the change. Hurry! Navid, go ahead and grab what he wants. You look at them for permission? Step aside. Don't you want him to go buy it? he's going. He's spoiled, you've spoiled him. I pray to God that He breaks your hand. Why would you hit your kid brother? You can't even curse properly. Go do your thing. If he just breaks his hand we'll have to look after him more. At least pray that he's run over by a Mercedes or a BMW, so we live off of his blood money. Are you here? Did you find the address? Are you with a car or a bike? Listen, our mutual friend hasn't called yet. Make sure he does quickly. Do you have more money on you? I don't have a scale, I have a 50. Alright pay a little extra. I'm on my way. We- Hello. Hang up, I'll dial your number. Don't waste your minutes. Where are you going with that? Are you sure he's not an undercover agent? Leave that here. If you knew him, get his money and then come back for this. Let me go, he's waiting. How many times do I have to tell you to not walk out with the drugs? If they catch you with this, if they don't execute you, Then they will for sure sentence you to life plus one day. Don't say I didn't tell you this when they're hanging you. What kind of a customer doesn't have an address? If he's so suspicious leave it at home. Don't hand it over to me, give it to her. Give it to me. The more I insist the more he doesn't get it. Don't give it to him. No I won't. Are you coming? Listen, first you gotta have our friend call me. Otherwise it's a no go. Hello? Stay quiet. What're you searching for? Why are you putting me in handcuffs? I said quiet. Just you see. What's going on?! What did I do? There's nothing on him He is clean. What should be on me? You can tell he's a dealer, these bills smell like opium. A dealer?! This is his cell phone. What else does he have? Just this key and some cash. Which one's your home? It's not around here. How am I supposed to know you're police officers? Where's your badge? He's screaming to alert people at home. Open every single door to find his place. Sir, which one is his place? I've seen him around the park but I don't know where he lives. I'll ask you nicely which one is your home? He must have a large stash. This bastard sells to 70 people a day. He's a homewrecker. If you shout, I'll shut you up. What're you talking about? Easy man, you're breaking my hand. Any luck? No, I think it's that other door. Do you even have a court order to enter my home? If you did you would know my address. I'm just missing the house number. But not for long. Son, come here for a second. I live the other way. Ijust have some opium, I live the other way. You were bringing us 50 grams of meth. Fine, let's go the other way, by the shop. Does this guy live around here? Yes. Why do you embarrass me in front of people? What will this kid say to his parents about me? Do you know him? Yes. Do you know where he lives? Yes. Will you show us his place? Yes, follow me. I swear to God he's lying. I swear to God he's lying. I swear to God he's lying. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You should be apologizing to the parents of people whose lives you've ruined. I made a mistake. You should've thought of this earlier. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I made a mistake. I'm sorry, I messed up. I messed up. I swear I won't do it again. I will never hit you again. Shut up, just shut up. I'm young, don't ruin my life. What about the young people whose lives you ruined? I didn't ruin anyone's life. I took my own brother to rehab. I swear I didn't get anyone addicted. Have some mercy. I swear to God he's lying. That's his house. Next to the fruit stand. They go up that side wall. That brick one? Yes. Thank you son. Don't look at him. Don't be afraid of him, you won't see him for years to come. They arrested Mohesn. Who? Moneza, they got him. What happend? Three people arrested him, they asked me where he lives I misguided them. Where did they take him? Moneza, we're done. Moneza, they'll be here soon. Quiet! Step aside. Moneza, what will happen? Don't open the door if they knock. Where is the 50 grams? Here, I'll flush it down. No it'll get stuck. He was packing opium in his room. Somayeh, his room. Leila, get some water ready. Give these to Moneza. Go back downstairs, is this all of it? There's nothing left. What's this? I hurt my arm throwing it. What if they find it? Where did it fall? Don't worry, they won't find it. I think it fell on Ms. Ashraf's roof. Navid where exactly did you point them to? That empty building where the homeless people sleep. Somayeh, Moneza. Moneza. What is that you're holding mom? What is it? It's Mohsen's. For God's sake! How long has this been in the house? Bring these over. Morteza! Morteza! What? Let's go after him. We'll have to go tomorrow. No point in going today. Navid, don't go anywhere, I'll send you to Shahnaz's place until things calm down. Okay. Get up, it'll be alright. Who is it? It's me. Hello Ashraf dear. Hi! How are you? Good thanks. I'm sorry to botheryou, his ball fell on your roof he's too embarrassed to go by himself. Go ahead. Hurry UP- Hi. Call when you get there. How much will it be? 1$- Expensive. That's the rate. Isn't it very much? Here. Just do your homework and don't talk back to Amir. Just ignore him if he teases you. Okey? When can I come back? I'll come after you as soon as possible. Cheer up! Make sure he gets in. No worries. Bye. Bye. It would be a mistake to go after Mohsen. Maybe it's for the best. Moneza, will they imprison him if they haven't found anything on him? Just pray that they have so they keep him. You're just saying that, you don't mean it. If they stormed in here in the past couple of weeks and found all this crap. They would've taken someone in Do you understand mom? If Mohsen wasn't here, they would've taken you in, or me. What could we do then? Things aren't that messed up. Mom, I have a history of addiction. If they would've come in and asked me whose crap is this? I would've had to rat out my own brother. You would've said he's just an addict. Everyone knows he's smoked every drug there is. Then the judge would've asked if he's just an addict why is everything so neatly packed? So perfectly weighed? I may be old, but I'm not senile. No one could've found it from where I'd hidden it. Stop your nonsense already. Don't play dumb mom. The second the agents walk in they search everywhere. First the obvious locations, then they look for loose tiles. If they suspect the tile, they're rip it out. If they suspect the walls, they tear it down. If they suspect your television set they'll smash it open. All else fails, they'll bring in trained dogs to sniff it out. If they suspect the women, they call in female agents to do a body search. What're you saying mom? For our own sake don't this again. Maybe I'm just absent minded. I want what's best for my kids. I can't get my mind around the things you do mom. When it comes to these things you're a lot more focused than I am. There I am yelling ifthere's any meth or opium in the house. And you choose not to hear me. I thought it was just opium. He has no other talents. I thought I would give it to him so he makes ends meet. You're really something! Mohsen won't come clean. You're all just scaring him with rehab camps and agents. He'll go smoke in the streets. Let him at least do it in his room. So we save face in public. Where does she get this logic from? What can I tell you when you don't understand? This won't be the end of it. He'll come back and raise hell. You'll end up giving him money for afix. I know, I raised him. Stop giving me a hard time. You only knew how to give birth knew nothing about raising anyone. She stuffs her mattress with this much meth and says she thought it was just opium. Your whole extended family has been on opium since God knows when, And you can't tell the difference?! That's enough, what can we do once we go there? We go where? I'm not coming. You take mom and say that your mother is sick, And that Mohsen is the man of the house and his record is clean. Mom, when you get there make sure you cry your eyes out. Mom, you take your time, we'll go upstairs. Hello. Hi. I'm sorry, did they bring my brother here? What did they catch him with? Nothing. Then why would they bring him here? We don't know either. Name. Mohsen Toulikhanloo. When did they arrest him? Yesterday. Where at? What difference does it make? So I can tell you if the judge has sent him to court or not. Nematabad outpost. They've let him go. Thank you. Don't come up mom. What happened? They've let him go. Thank God! Thank you. Take care. Moneza, come lock this door so no one else comes. No one comes in here even with the doors wide open. If you wanna fight I'm going to leave. We're here to talk. Didn't I tell him that the guy was suspicious, that not to go out? I'm talking to you! What more do I have to say to this bastard? Don't remind us, he made a mistake. Why did he escape from the rehab center? He was worried for Somayeh, so he came. Why didn't you tell me you were going to Afghanistan? You weren't here. Why do I have to first learn about your marriage to an Afghan when I'm in rehab? Mohsen, you didn't drag us here to talk about this stuff. Answer my question, why did you escape? I'll go back if Somayeh doesn't leave. If you were worried for Somayeh you'd go back right this second. Oh so you want me gone so you can ship her off. Don't get me started. What guarantee is there that you'll stop if I don't leave? I swear to God I will. I'm already in withdraw. I will go get teeth implants in the same place that he did. Just let your temporary marriage with him expire. Azam these are all lies. You're all just ruining Somayeh's life. He just wants her to call off her marriage. You can go live with Azam for a while, So you don't see us. Then you'll see if I come clean or not if I get new teeth or not. I have my father's place. Why would I live anywhere else? It would have been good if she could get her own place for a while. What good would living alone do? No I meant... If you suggest that one more time I won't let you live alone anymore. I'll drag you into my own room. If Somayeh breaks it off with this guy who will ever marry her after that. Everyone knows she married him. Who do you think this guy is?! You talk as if she would lose Shahrokh Khan. You think your sister's an Aishwarya that you expect a Shahrokh Khan?! Morteza! All that money from the shop is making you ballsy! You either emptied out the register here to traded drugs. There were only 4 or 5 times when my customers didn't have cash and I swiped their cards here. You're really something! You'd register all the lottery tickets to your name people found out and stopped coming here. But whatever, it's my fault, that gives you the right to marry off your sister? Shut up, the guy is a gentleman, he'd buy both of us with a single check. Why would you keep her from having a nice life? Somayeh, you've seen Nazir, if you think you'll find someone better than him, you don't have to go. If he's a gentleman why didn't he come with his family to properly propose? Why did you arrange for them to meet in the streets? You wanted me to impress them with the rusty staircase in the yard or your beautiful teeth?! Why did have them get married so suddenly?! Suddenly?! You want her to get depressed like Leila? Why is this any of your business? Do you even know what family means? Why do they want to have the wedding ceremony over there? Their whole family is there, they can't drag all of them here. Why can't we have a wedding here? The groom has to throw a wedding, what's it to us? With what money? For whose family? Who will come and complain about the food and the drinks? You've put your husband's blood money in the bank and are making twice as much our father's retirement salary. We have no money! Can she come with me to the wedding? Of course, we can't have you be alone there! God knows, we'll see. You'll leave if I let you. Shahnaz can you come stay with me until the wedding ceremony? I'm here and Amir is out of control. Why can't you go with her Azam? I would if I didn't have work to do. I told hertoo, I'm too busy Why didn't you call us over earlier? He was holding on to their phones. They're all very afraid of him. Navid had the smarts to call you from an outside phone. Otherwise I would've lost it. Ever since we came here everyone has forgotten us. It's betterthan having a landlord. At least you don't pay rent. I don't know. What is this game he's playing? Amir Open the door. Are you deaf? Tell us what happened we'll go and file a complaint. At least tell us where you got into a fight so we go show our faces. This way they won't come after you again. He's already hot-headed, no need to fan his flames. Let him teach athing or two so he toughens up. Blood money for aface is calculated by millimeters. You should see what they've done to his beautiful face, he's cut from here to here. Did you have anything on you? How many of them were they? Did you hit back? Where's his dad? He's at work all day. Did his dad do anything once he found out? What can he do? He's afraid of his big ass. They'll fine the guy $15-$17,000 for the damages to his face. When you get it take him to a good plastic surgeon so it doesn't leave a mark. If I were you, I wouldn't spend a dime. I would deposit it in the bank and live off of the interest. If you fix it, he'll have another one soon after. He's probably happy it's on his face. He'll show off the scar to his classmates. Amir, will you open the door or do I have to break it open? We didn't come all the way out here from Tehran for nothing. Open it. Whatever money they give me- -I'll put it on top of this house and get a place near you guys. Maybe he'll be afraid of you and clean his act. Yeah, it's crappy out here. Is there a park nearby? In the back, why? Amir, open up, Amir! Amir, open up, Amir! Shahnaz, have you seen Somayeh's ID card? I haven't been to Tehran for two months, how could I have? Just say you haven't. Amir, if you're not going to open we'll go ourselves. Ask his friend. The one who picks him up every day. He's right. Do you have any of his friends' phone numbers? He only has one friend. Let me get it. What do you want my friend's number for? Hello there! Why won't you leave already? Amir! Son! You're not going to call anyone. Easy! How is my face any of your business? Calm down dipshit! Sweetie we came to see what happened? Seen it? Now get in your car and leave. You should be ashamed. Moneza, it's fine, let's go. I won't stay here until someone clears things up with him, I'd come with you. Talk like an adult. Tell us where and when you got into this fight, so we go file a complaint and give them hell. I already gave them hell, you can leave now. This is how you gave them hell? Don't you dare raise your hands on me. Drop it before I knock you out. What happened? Moneza, let me see. Are you alright? Did you hit your head? Amir, I pray to God that I bury that evil eye of yours. I hope to spend that blood money on your own funeral. If you're not happy go to your daddy's mansion. You want me to leave so you do whatever the heck you want? I won't leave you alone even for a second. You shouldn't stay here. Get up. I'm so sorry. I'm so damn sorry. Forgive me. Forgive me brother. I'm sorry. You did a real good thing that you didn't hit him. If you had they would have said- Just stop Somayeh. Mohsen. What? What did Shahnaz make for lunch? Fesenjoon. You didn't bring me any? An amazing Fesenjoon! Somayeh I'm leaving, need anything? You're leaving? I have a lot of work to do. Bye mom. Bye. Clear this space out, we have work to do. Leila, get up. Roll over. I'm sorry. I've been calling Leilafor four hours to no avail. I've had to hold it in, the pain is killing me. But I asked you if you had to go to the bathroom or not. I didn't at that point. I bought two containers of pickles. Chop them up nice and neat. Okay. Maybe it's because you held it in for so long. What's wrong mom? Are you nauseated? The smell bothers you? Then what? A sneeze! Really? Are you about to sneeze? Somayeh, mom is about to sneeze. - Let me put this here. - Really mom? Oh dear, why do you smoke near her? This is not the place to refuel your lighter. Mom, close your eyes. Don't look at the light. Don't you know that her muscles are strained? If she sneezes she'll die from the pain. Relax mom, try not to sneeze. Relax. Try not to sneeze. Relax. Relax. Poor thing. Should I rub your back? Okay. Why don't I? What? Why don't I die? You'll get well, what're you saying? What good would that do, I'm at the end of my life. I'll personally take you to the doctor on Monday. Do you want me to give you some opium to calm you down? Mohsen! Opium! Do you want me to give you some opium to calm you down? That's all we need, for our mother to die from opium addiction! What addiction? Just a small dose at night so she can sleep. They've given me pills stronger than this junk, but the pain just won't go away. Alright, don't eat it. I'll dissolve some in hot water, you rub it on her back and stuff. What are you talking about? Let's see if you can get her addicted as well! Do you understand how much pain she's in? Oh you understand? And you prescribe opium! Don't be afraid, eat it, if it doesn't sit well you'll throw it up. I won't eat it, rub some in, let's see if it works. She's up for it! I won't eat it. I'll rub some on my sides to stop the pain. Keeping up with your sons. I meant Mohsen. I swear to God I'm in pain. She's in pain, why can't you just give her some? This stuff won't do a thing to her pain. How can he not care about anyone? Let me rub some on my head. Everyone, just get out, I have work to do. Leila bring some clean clothes for mom. I'm sorry to keep you waiting ma'am. No problem. Punch these in please. Who works with him at home? I help him with math and English, everything else, no one. For the entry exam these two are vital. Is there a fee to attend the School for the Gifted? No, it's state-owned. Even the shuttle service is free. From our school, Navid is most likely to get in. That's what his teachers say. He just has to practice. Thank you ma'am. These are his grades. They're all superb. Thank you very much. We'll have a celebration soon, to hand out awards to our top students. You should come too. Because Navid will also be awarded. Thank you. You just have to pay us $15. I'm sorry, what for? The award for Navid. We want to buy him an award. An award in your own name? No in the schooI's name. Don't mess up his books and notebooks. No I'm careful. Is this 42 or 43? That's 42 Morteza? Yep. Look at Navid's grades. Good job, looks good. Looks good?! He's getting into the honor roll and no one seems to care. What can we do? Praise him. Encourage him. Navid. I swear he's better than everyone in school. Come here. Buy him a gift or something. Alright, Take a deep breath. Are you coming? What is it? Come here. Give me a kiss. Then go to my car and bring me my CD. Hurry up! Get it he middle! I don't know how! Here, a gift! I swear I don't know! Give him his gift already! First he has to dance! He doesn't know how. I won't until he dances! Alright, you want him to dance?! Come here, let me show a universal move! What do you want to do? Look at me. Do as I do! Wait a second! What're you doing?! He's a good dancer! That's not dancing, was this your universal move? It's too feminine! What's wrong with it? He has to dance like a man. - I'll teach you myself. - Who said you're any better?! What's so funny? Shut it! Look at me, you know what an axis is?! Yes I do. Have you studied the axis!? Just like this! You go down, you come up! Dance well so you get a present. You can even do it with one hand. Open your mouth. Look at him. Mohsen, come here. Wipe some of that makeup off Moneza or Mohsen will see you in the street. I'm just going to do some shopping. Be home before dark. Shut it. Leila! Wait. I said wait! What are these cats doing in your room?! What? What are these cats doing in your room?! Quiet. It's ajob. I get a $100 a month for each one. You would have to spend all of it on themselves. There will be about $30-40 left from each one. They're all sick, they'll get us sick. Theyjust have broken legs, they're not sick. You disgust yourself so much you take 6 showers a day. What will you do with all these cats?! Nonsense! Get lost. You kept whining about me not having a job, and nowthat I do this is what I get? Please go back to your old job. I swear you can't take care of these. Why would I bring them here if I couldn't? Because you're counting on me. Am I a cripple to be counting on you? I wish you were a cripple At least they work 9 hours a day. You're either sleeping or showering. You're leaving, what's it to you? Navid, come here. Come here, hurry up. Go sit next to mom. Mohsen... Leila, come here. Azam come here, it's the last one. Run Moneza. Take this off. Let's have you look good in the picture. Mohsen, come already. Moneza, hang up for a second. Mohsen, hurry. I've pressed it. Don't move. Azam, don't move. Mohsen, hurry. It's cold. I've pressed it. Mohsen, hurry! Am I even in? Why did you sit there? Somayeh, are you done? I'm leaving. Morteza? What does life plus one day mean? It means until you're alive plus one day. What does that mean? When ajudge passes someone a life sentence- - It's very likely that he will be pardoned and released after a few years. With a life plus one day sentence- - They would have to stay in prison for one day after they die. He'll go free a day after dying. So it's impossible to be pardoned. Why? Because of that one day. Can you put your cigarette out? I'm sorry So they're never set free? If they're really a good person in prison. After 15 years and one day they will be reevaluated. Now get some sleep. There you go. Thanks. Look at how hard our little Navid is working! It's very big. I hope he makes up for all that he lost in the other place. Why are you sad? Who's the girl? Probably the one he talks to 24/7. She's coming... Why are standing outside. Please come in. Mr. Mohsen, come in please. We will. Thanks. Thank you. Dear Mr. Moneza will be upset to see you standing outside. We'll come. I promise. You go ahead. Okay, whatever you're comfortable with. She's very down to earth. She still hasn't gotten what she wants. The second she does she won't even recognize her own father. Why do you know her father? I'm be a sister-in-law after all! I didn't buy her whole “please come in“ bit. That “please come in“ was in fact the good old “please leave!“ These types know how to make room for themselves. What exactly did she mean by Dear Mr. Moneza, she meant our own Morteza?! We're coming... We will... Should we go help them out? It'll be fun! I'll scare his customers if I come. Don't be like that. It's our own shop. Let's go and have a falafel ourselves. No way. The Afghans are coming to pick you up on Friday? Yeah. Will you come with me and stay until after the wedding? You scared me, I thought it was Mohsen. Somayeh, here go put these bills into a bundle. If we continue like this for3 or 4 years we can buy the shop. I hope so. I really hope so. Can I have that new bill? This one? Yes. Thank you Yasser dear. You're welcome. Thank you, it was very kind of you to come all this way. Let me bring it in. No. Sorry if it's not much. Hi. Hidean This is the same guy who went to that fight with Amir. What? Moneza. Hi. Go have a talk with Yasser, I've dragged him out here. Who's Yasser? Amir's friend. See if you can get him to talk. He's here? Yes. He is at the door. Just don't fight. I'll just talk. Mohsen. Mohsen. Yasser, where did you and Amir get into that fight? I wasn't with Amir, I don't know. You can't handle being asked nicely? Moneza, he's Amir's friend, be nice. For Amir's sake. Sir, why are you talking to me like that? Should I change my tone so you start talking? Sir, be mindful of your age old man. Who's he talking to? No Mohsen. Who's he talking to? No Mohsen, Moneza, this is Amir's friend. Who did hejust call an old man? Stop it Mohsen, stop. You're not talking to show how much you care for your buddy? They're neighbors, don't turn them into enemies. I'll leave him alone. Hejust has to say who hit Amir. Just say where he got into a fight. Who cut his face? I don't know. Is this how it is ma'am? Found me alone. Two to one? No one has laid a finger on you... You wanna get in the car and we'll go back to your hood. Alright, sit in the car and let's get out of your hood, and then we'll talk. What're you doing? Mohsen! - Stop it Mohsen. - Don't hit the car. Shut your mouth kid. Just tell us where you got into that fight. I don't know sir. Instead of acting like a hoodlum just say that you don't know. What I wanna know is why someone your age hangs out with a 16 year old? Sir, don't, I work with this car. Where did you fight? Iwasn't with him that night, lwasn't. Stop. Will you talk or should I burn it down? You calm him down. Don't hit the car, it's not mine. Where did you fight? Where did you fight? There was no fight. He cut himself to improve his street cred. How are you? No you get the mustard just for tonight. Tomorrow we'll make it ourselves. Me too. Hi. I said me too. I can't right now. There are people around. There are people around. Here... Ijust did! Alright here! Another? Here... How was it? Bye. What are you laughing at? Nothing! What do you want? Were you at the registry office with them? They only took mom. Does Moneza keep his files here? Those are my stuff, look at the other cabinet. What're you doing with them? Why are they still running around? Let them eat first. What're you doing Mohsen? There. Shahnaz, do you have Ibuprofen? Don't give her any of that. First she has to eat her breakfast then I'll give her her pills. Mohsen, do you want breakfast or lunch? Moneza has a red folder of documents. Have you seen it? Why do you want it? Are you keeping Mor1eza's drugs? No. Morteza hasn't touched anything for three years. What drugs? Are you searching for drugs or documents? Both. Leila I'm not like Morteza. Don't give me an attitude when you're talking to me. Okay let go of her. Tell me, what're you looking for? Documents. What documents? As soon as I find the red folder you'll understand If I say it you will all saythat I'm nuts. Mohsen, let's not start any problems. Bring two boiled eggs to my room. With soft yolks. Can't you eat it here? The guests will be here soon. We still have work to do. Make sure the egg white is cooked. Bring ice too. They'll come right? Why wouldn't they? You had no luck with your life here. I wish you'd marry someone nice. Who's this guy you're going to Afghanistan with? Don't Afghan Afghan him when you haven't even met him. He's from Taibod. It doesn't make a difference if he's an Afghan or an Iranian. I'm just saying it's not safe there. They have the Taliban, and bombs. Can't he get a house right here in Tehran? He's constantly traveling back and forth. He has family here. What does constantly mean? Once a year?! What happens if God willing they bomb you and you get killed?! Leila, don't you want to take care of these cats? I live only 20 kilometers outside of the city, And after two years I'm still not used to it. How do you plan on going across the universe?! A place where you don't know anyone. Not a choice, I'll get used to it. This means you really want to go now? You started the rumor that me leaving is a rumor, That even I'm starting to believe it! If that's the case, then why didn't you let me fix you up a bit? Because they don't like their girls plucking eyebrows before moving in. Leila, I'm leaving with orwithout that ID. Are you suggesting that I'm hiding it to keep you from leaving? Are you sure it's not Navid? Ever since he found out they're taking you away today he's called me a hundred times. He's scared. He doesn't know what to do without you. Why the long face? I always look like this. Let me pluck your eyebrows at least. It hurts, I don't want to. Are you upset that Somayeh is younger than you and getting married? Did Somayeh say that? No because when Azam got married before me I was upset. I thought I'd somehow cursed her that's why she couldn't get pregnant. Are you sure she's not the one who cursed you with that kid of yours? You're all fooling yourselves with your marriages. You get married so you don't become an old maid. Better an old maid than married with such husbands. Where have you been all day? You said I can play 'til ten. I gave you money for an hour at the gaming center, how did you manage four? Are you gambling there? Swear to God I'm not! Don't swear. Never swear. Don't ever swear with lies like we do. Okay? Okay? Okay. What did you tell Shahnaz when you called her? I didn't call anyone. Then what is she saying? Navid. Look at me. Little brother! Why did you call Shahnaz? What is it that you can't tell me directly? Can you take me with you? Who said anything about me leaving? You say it every day! I'm afraid that one day you'll leave when I am not here. Promise not to tell anyone if I tell you something? Promise? I'm not going anywhere. I'm just trying to scare them. What does that mean? I want them to start living like normal people. Are you trying to scare me too? Not if you promise me to get into that School of gifted. Swear to God that you won't go. Of course I won't. Where would I go without you? You promised not to tell anyone. I won't. Now go get some money from my purse and get a haircut. So they see what a handsome little brother I have. I'll go soon. Didn't you want these? I brought them. Put them there, I'll iron them. Doing good mom? Just pray that God is happy with me dear. I feel guilty just asking you how you are! Don't ask if you don't want to hear the truth. Is it done? It's done, mom. It suits you. Thank you. Somayeh, I'll go change my clothes. Should I wear red or stripes? Wear something more classy dear. Brown or navy blue. Azam, isn't this ventilator too small? I don't know. Is it Somayeh? Would they get a bigger one if I thought it was? Moneza takes his sweet time. He's been meaning to install a toilet bowl for mom for 6 years. What pill are you taking on an empty stomach? Don't worry about me. I'm just saying... Why don't you worry about the people are fighting each other out of fear of you leaving? Leila! What's wrong with you? She acts like one of those people who die for their family. Makes me want to puke. You should be embarrassed. After all she's done for you. No one ever had any problems here If they did, they weren't aware of it. She takes two courses in sewing and then suddenly starts comparing us with the world. You're getting everyone to hate themselves what' re you trying to prove? What is she saying? Everyone has problems. Some families have retards. Let's just think that Mohsen is a retard. You've been looking at all us trying to decide if you should leave or not. Well I'm looking at you too. If you wanna go, just go, stop driving the rest of us crazy. If you want to go, why don't even open the gifts that poor guy is sending you? Why won't you return his phone calls? Why won't you ever accept his invitation to go to a restaurant? She herself is hiding her ID card, And going around asking us if we have it! She even asked Shahnaz if she has her ID. Leila, get out. Go attend to your cats and tigers. Don't cry sis. You're doing the right thing. When you leave everyone will have to figure themselves out. For how long are we going to hurt each other out of compassion? Don't go. Wait a little bit longer. Hopefully you'll find someone who you actually like. Let's not fool ourselves. Somayeh is 30, and she's beautiful. And yet she hasn't had a single suitor. Shahnaz. What matters is a good family, which we don't have. What's wrong with our family? Otherthan Mohsen? Do you know why Moneza gets excited when he talks about other people's problems? Because he wants us to think that we're not doing so bad. Don't cry sweetheart. I say you shouldn't go. Go only if you want to. Just try to go somewhere better than here. And don't count on Mor1eza's words too much. Why do you think I didn't come back to live here? Because nothing ever ends. From sarcastic remarks to dirty dishes. My husband died Byears ago. For 8 years, at nights they decide to improve their lives, In the mornings they forget. No one will ever change here. We all have to go our separate ways. Over here nothing ends. There's a story behind every word we say to each other. That's enough Azam. Leave her alone. Am Iwrong mom? I'm not around, but down here if you want tea, You have to pour tea for 20 people. They'll buy rice to feed themselves, And then act as if they've bought you gold bracelets. I wish we would wake up and realize it has all been a nightmare. What are you saying my dear? Honestly mom... Don't go anywhere, we have to talk. I have nothing to say to you. You see how he talks to me? Then you complain about why I cuss him out. You cuss all of us out. Why are you angry? For two hours I've been searching for something I'm sure he's hiding. Moneza is? He wants to start shit. You think your brother took me to rehab so I get clean! No I just wanted you to take a break, So you can start all over with a clean lung! If you've stopped, why do you still want the drugs? Why do you talk like him? Why do you talk to me in that tone? Shahnaz, stop it, the guests will be here soon. When I went into rehab I had this much drugs left at the shop. Don't think I'm making it up. This one's new. Fresh from today. If you're not making money from my drugs, How did you start up that new business. Have you seen its comb? What comb? You don't know what a comb is? I'm talking to you! Are you sure you're in withdrawal right now? You're not high on anything? I've said it from day one. In rehab I will come clean from meth. For now. Opium later. Step by Step- Can someone tell me why he's so charged up? Alright fine, you're the smart one You've proven me wrong. But where are my drugs? When I don't answer him, He'll bang his head against the window. When I do, he does this. What can I do to calm you down? Help me find this comb. Where are my drugs? You've been back for three days and you weren't asking for them. What got into you all the sudden? If you talk like this outside of here no one will ever work with me again. You think I'm like you? That I will talk shit behind my own brother's back? You took me to rehab, you could've just said he's here to come clean. Why bring up pissing in a bucket? Okay, let's go for a second. How can get you to not come here? Who convinced you to come back? Azam? Azam is not remarrying because she wants her dead husband's pension. Otherwise if you found her a husband in Russia, She would swim there in one go. You still don't knowthem. The second you come back, He will be first to talk shit about you. It's that type of nonsense that makes them think I've lost my mind. I'll bury you in the middle of the yard, And we'd all be better off. Sure, and I would just look at you. Stop it. This time around I won't send you to a nearby camp. I'd ship you across the country. You're all talk. They get worse when they have an audience. Let's go. You shave your cats with my trimmer?! Yes dear? Hi. No I'm good. What is it? You're the good one! Buythem in kilos, then wash and chop. In equal sizes please. Please! Please! Mohsen! Listen, can I call you back? Yes. Bye. Mohsen, take it easy today. Moneza, don't talk back to him. Why won't my customers call anymore? You weren't around for 10 days. Last year I went to Armenia for two weeks, Did I receive any less calls? 10 days you took over my phone and redirected my customers to your own number, Told them I'm not doing this anymore. He's completely delusional. The only person who ever calls me is that poor girl. I will not rest easy until I get that SIM card from you. What SIM card? When you have 200 cash-in-hand customers call you, Your $1 SIM card will be worth $4000. He knows. Someone offered me that 6 months ago and I refused. The reason why no one calls you anymore is that, An opium addict will lose his head if he doesn't get his fix. Why would he wait for you, you wake up in the evening. People eat that shit in the morning so they go work all day. I'm telling you, he's delusional! Fine. I'm delusional. You're correct. Tell Shahnaz to not come here because I will ruin her life. Tell Somayeh to leave so she doesn't have to tolerate me. Somayeh, did I ever saythat? I never said such a thing. But whoever has the chance to leave this hell hole, And does is worth less than a dog. And whoever goes and comes back is worth even less. If you're up to something, don't do it at my expense. Be a man, just tell us that you want to empty out the house, So get married and bring home a wife. You think if I wanted to get married I'd be afraid of you? Of course. But what I wanna know is who would so worthless than a worthless dog to come live here with you. Someone who steals from his own brother. You want me to go and leave you in charge of this house? Please don't. I'd leave right now. But if I go I won't even come back for your funerals. I would drill a hole in this door just to watch your miserable lives. Stand up, make sure it's not broken, I want to pay for it. He's your brother. Wouldn't you be happy for him if he got married? He's getting older, what would be wrong with that? I'm delighted to find out he's talking to a girl. Damn anyone who doesn't want to see his brother settle. But not at the cost of forcing his sister into a marriage with a man no one knows. That's enough Mohsen. They don't want you to leave, You've been serving them like a maid. For once in your life use that brain of yours to think. To understand. No one would ever agree to marry someone whose brothers are you and me. Don't say that. Why? You know who does? Someone like her hapless husband who lets others marry him off. Shahnaz is nearby, her son is afraid of us, And this is her life. This guy you don't even know. Somayeh he presents everything upside down. He makes Navid work for him at the shop. And says it's to keep his mind off of Mohsen. Navid's the only one with a brain. I won't take him in to work. So you hit him in the head. And make him drop out of school. You use to hit me, and I hit him. To open another branch of you! Enough! The whole neighborhood heard us. Who is making me raise my voice? Meth. That's how he gets in my head and doesn't let go. Mohsen, mom is trying to sleep. Don't you have any compassion, Morteza? Why did you take Somayeh to get married when no one was around? Either that guy is up to something or you're hiding something from us. Didn't you take all my customers... What would I do with your customers. You keep whining. If you had the balls you'd go to the park and find yourself customers and give them your number. But you don't. You never did. Back in school they'd call him Rusty Moneza, He wouldn't talk back. I'd fight for him and he would come and separate us. Don't start with the school... Not in front of me. It's almost 3. You're not ready yet. Who wants me to get dressed? Okay then, just go in your room. We'll talk it all over after our guests leave. That's right. Something Moneza would say. Have Mohsen go in his room so he doesn't embarrass us. Stop pitying yourself. We tell you to get dressed you object. We tell you to go in your room you object. You do your own thing. Somayeh you know this family. Everyone is always talking shit. Sisters talk behind each other's backs. Brothers do this. If dad wouldn't let Azam get married she'd become a runaway girl. But she did and was ruined and they blamed it on dad. Calm down. If you go and come back dad is not around anymore. I'm telling you but you're not hearing me. He's using me to kick all of you out. God, how can anyone be so spineless? You tell us how you were able to open this new shop. Didn't he use the money from the previous store? The previous store was 20 meters in a side street. This one is 40 meters in a major street. If he didn't sell drugs where did he get his money from? I swear to God I haven't touched drugs in three years. You'd sell. I did not sell or buy or use. A home be damned without a father. What was that mom? Can't you behave a little? The real asshole was your husband who dropped dead and passed on everyone's responsibility to me. Moneza, stop it. What do I tell her? Nothing. God has punished me enough with you guys. Mom! When you open your mouth you expect her not to? What do you care who Somayeh gets married to? You grow balls inside the house. Just tell him where you got the money to shut him up. Did you get it from the Afghans? Theyjust insisted on paying for the registry costs. Up until now you hadn't gotten anything from them. I didn't. They paid it themselves. Then why didn't you tell anyone? Who said I didn't? Who did you tell? To Somayeh. Somayeh, did you know? Yes... I swear to the Prophet you're lying. Don't go. Come back, Don't make me break everything. Don't cover for him. I bet my life that you're lying. Alright. Don't shout. Calm down. See what you started? You're saying you go this much and you say you knew. Where's your proof? Where's the receipt? He looks like this when he's scared. He's done something. I know him. Okay. She has her temporary marriage certificate. Somayeh, show it to him. Not that. You have a different kind of a contract with them. Where's your red folder. Bring that out. It's in the shop, I'll bring it tomorrow. Today. Not tomorrow. If you don't prove it today I won't let her leave. Go bring it. It would be too late, I'd miss the guests. Then I'll sit in the middle ofthis yard and ask the guests myself. Then I'll sit in the middle ofthis yard and ask the guests myself. I want to spend the rest of my life with them, you'd embarrass me. So you agree that he got money from them. And not just a tiny amount. A large sum. I'm telling you I didn't. Stop putting words in my mouth. Fine. I'll wait right here Let's see what they have to say. Mohsen, you want to belittle me in front of them? You should think twice before rushing to his defense. If pays them back and calls off the marriage I will leave him alone. Somayeh, he has sold you. That's really something. I've worked with a few Afghan brides. I know there's a tradition where the groom pays the bride's family. But no one is selling anything. What's the matter? That's their tradition. What's that got to do with the crap you're saying? Oh now you've found a legal justification! At least have the decency to tell Somayeh that you've made money from her, And opened up a falafel shop. And if the wedding is called off they will sue you and you'd go to jail. Just tell us that's what's happening, so we keep her here. I'll personally work the streets for two months and paythem back. Work the streets? You take money out of the cash register to buy your drugs! Your cash register barely covers my cigarettes. Alright Mohsen. Just ask them when they get here. Just don't shout. No one doubts himself here, right Morteza? Why do you think I doubt myself? How did I ask? Of course no one doubts themselves. I'm just saying what can he possibly say to them looking like this. Mohsen, just change your clothes. I'll bring you something to eat. Somayeh, on what grounds you plan on leaving mom alone? Whenever you're not home your sisters don't feed her food or water, So she doesn't have to go to the bathroom. I'm asking you not to leave because I don't know who this guy is. Because mom is sick and if you go she'll be done. Because our home and life will reek But if you go, don't ever come back. Because they will no longer say their Azam won't remarry. That their Leila chooses not to marry. They will say that the problem is with them. Think about us. Don't turn us into a laughing stock of the neighborhood. That's tears from a high. She's seen Nazir. She says he's a good person. He may be a good person, but she doesn't love him. She loves someone else, she still looks at his photos. I once saw them in the streets and I punched him in the face. And I didn't let her go back to her sewing class. Please don't go Somayeh. Don't go Somayeh. If you're leaving because you're scared of him, don't. Don't be fooled by his shiny suit. He's wearing this to pressure you more. If you're leaving us because of me, don't. I'll leave. I swear to God I will leave. I will sleep in the streets, but I will go, don't leave Somayeh. You're homeless inside our own home, Can't imagine what will become of you outside. Moneza, stop it. Shame on you. You two are killing us. All of mom's problems are because of her nerves. It's not her nerves. She should have thought of this, When she was popping kids left and right. Moneza your phone is ringing. Just let it charge. He doesn't sell to my customers in front of me. Go see who it is. You all heard that. He said it himself. What're you doing? Give me the phone. Give it to me. Didn't you just say I should? Let me see who's calling Don't do it. There are private stuff on there. I'll take the SIM card, you take the phone. Mohsen, there's a girl who calls him. For once in my life there's a girl who has taken an interest in me. She's someone like yourself. Why're you doing this? Give me my phone. Let him go, Stop it. Please! Please! Look at me! Let me see you. Do I look good? Very much. Too big for me. No it's fine. Hopefully once you're clean you'll gain back some weight. Hopefully. I thought I wear this so you don't say, I embarrassed you in front of the guests. Thanks. Have your lunch. Let me look at you. Do this. You want me to bring some ice for your face? No. It's nothing. I'm thirsty. Do we have any soda? With ice? Yeah Iforgot. I'll bring it foryou. Get inside. Get back in Leila. Who is it? Somayeh, go back inside. Go. Hi. Same old place. Take these stairs to that room. Go inside sis. Moneza, right now?! I said go inside. Who just went up there? Nothing. Go back in. Right now? When did he call? Let go of your hand. Let go. Somayeh... Moneza... Be careful. Moneza... Moneza... Somayeh... Somayeh... Somayeh... I'm not coming. I'm not coming. Somayeh. Somayeh... Get his hand. I'm not coming. I'm not coming. Somayeh. Take him outside. I'm not coming. I'm not coming. Don't do this in front of your family. Moneza. Take him outside. Somayeh... Take him outside. Morteza... Morteza... Somayeh... Very kind of you. You're welcome. Thank you very much. Take care. You should visit us in Afghanistan. It's not as bad as they say. We will. Mom is right. Please visit us. We will for sure. Just promise us to take good care of her. Don't worry about Somayeh. She's like our own daughter. Somayeh doesn't have anyone other than you over there. Don't worry. Goodbye. Goodbye. It was very kind of you to come. Hope they have a happy life. Goodbye. Mr. Moneza, with your blessing I'll go too. Don't mention it. Be careful on the road tonight. Iwill. Thank you mother. You really don't have to. Thanks. Bye. Bye. Somayeh is on her way... Azam dear... Shahnaz, please don't cry. Come here mom. My sweetheart. I wish you a happy life. I really do. Sweetie... What's wrong? Hi... Hi. Where were you? Getting a haircut. I need to take a shower, anyone in there? What are we going to tell him? Don't say anything, go back in. Can't do that! Go in Shahnaz. Hey kiddo! You look very handsome. Your hair looks good. What happened? Somayeh... Where were you? I went to the game center to catch you red-handed. I couldn't find you. Gojump in the shower, I'll bring you your clothes and towel. Take her back inside. Take her in. Alright fine, why are you acting like this? Whatever you hear, do not come out. Fine. Go! Hey there. Is Mohsen in? You knocked the door down. If you want Mohsen, call him. I do he never answers. What can I do. Keep calling until he does. If he would I wouldn't come here. What can I do foryou now? A 3 grammer please. What's a 3 grammer? I'm saying he's not here. He's right up there. Just get him. Just leave already. Don't stand here. Hello? Nazir? No need to shout Nazir! She's here. At home. Yeah I'll give that back to you. That's not a problem. Just listen to me... I didn't say I wouldn't pay. I'll find a way and pay you back. She says she doesn't want to, what can I do? You don't have to come here. Come to the shop tomorrow morning. I keep saying not right now and you don't listen! Fine come over. Your call... Hello?
