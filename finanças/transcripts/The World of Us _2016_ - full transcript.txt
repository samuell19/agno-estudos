I said, it's okay. - What's this? - Tutoring school books. - What school? - For English. Grandma forced me to go. When did you start? Who cares? Can't you go to tutoring school with me? I don't think I can. Why? Too expensive? Well, sort of. Want me to pay for you? What? I can ask Dad to pay. Then we can go together. Why should your clad pay? Because I want to go with you. But that's not right. She picked up! How's your damn life? - Give me that. - Like your new school? Kids from my old school goofing around. Can't you get a cell phone? What? What kid doesn't have a cell phone these days? My battery runs out faster because you keep using it. - I didn't use it much. - Come on. You play games on it and your morn calls looking for you.

Don't worry, we'll find him. - Yoon! - What about tutoring? Who cares). We gotta find '(com! - Yoom - Lee Your“.! What do I do? - What if he's gone? - We'll find him. - Let's split up.

How is he doing? He had a seizure earlier, but he's better now. That's a relief. He kept asking for his son. - He's outside. - I see. - Should I tell him to come? - It's okay. - Who took my cell phone? - She did! I really need it. What's wrong? My credit cards won't work. I gotta check my balance. " Mom? - Yes? Can you buy me a cell phone? You can use mine. Everyone has one. I'm the only one who doesn't. Quiet. I have to focus. What kid doesn't have a cell phone these days. Quiet! That's not important now. - Ask for an advance, dear. - Is the bill high? It doesn't matter if only he can get better. They said he kept asking for you. Why rush all the way here and not go in? Let's drop it. So stubborn. Quiet! Didn't you all miss me? Happy to be back at school? ' No! ' Really? Didn't you miss us? - Hi, Jia... - Bora! Can't you tell? Anyway, we have a new friend this semester. Say hello. Hi, I'm Han Jia. Hope we become good friends. Nice and simple. Heard her name? Help Jia get adjusted. Okay? - Yes! - Good. Let's get Jia seated. Sun! Put your hand up. There's an empty seat beside Sun. Sun? Help Jia, okay? - Yes! - Good. Did everyone have a good summer? Yes! Did you cry because you missed me? Did you see me wave before? No, I didn't. - Should we change seats? - Yes! Let's change then. - She lived in London. Right? - Really? - How many years? - A year or so. - That's cool. - I've never been there. You must be good at English. What do you want for your birthday? It's okay. - Come on, tell us. - Can it be expensive? - Of course! We buy together. - Look. One, two, three! Tada! - So pretty! - Isn't it? - It's expensive! - I want to do this too! Expensive things are prettier. Let's invite some cute boys to your birthday party. Well... Tell us what you want for your birthday. Let's go play outside! Come on! Where are my headphones? Coming! Geeze! - Hi. - Hi. Busy? Not really. Why did you come? Because it's your birthday. Here. - It's okay. - Take it. - It's okay. - It's expensive. Open it. I'll open it later. Open it now. I said, later. Let's go on trampolines. - Now? - Mom gave me money. - Let's go. - I can't. I have homework. - Homework? - Yeah. There's no homework this week. - Tutoring homework. - I see. Sorry, I'd better go. Hold on. - Are you mad at me? - No. - You look like you are. - It's because of homework. - Just tell me, Jia. - I gotta do my homework. - Be honest. - I am! - You can tell me. - Nothing! Stop! - Something's wrong to... - Jia! Is it the pizza? - Hi. - Hi. - You invited her? - No. A party? Weren't you busy with homework? Stop butting in when we're playing. Some boys are coming! - She's invited? - No... Well... - How did she know? - She just came. - What? - She's always like that. What's gotten into you? How could you leave your brother alone? I'm not saying you can't play with your friends. But you should keep your responsibilities. And what's this? Why you... Where'd you get it? Bought it? Sun! She used my cell phone a lot. Why? Tell her to use hers. - She doesn't have one. - Really? Let's go. - Why? - Tell her to give it back. Sun. Give Jia the colored pencils you borrowed. Huh? The ones Jia let you borrow. Give them back. But you gave them to me. Since when? I lent them to you. - Why would she give 'em to you? - You must've misunderstood. Give 'em back now. Check it. - Two are missing. - Where are they? My little brother lost them. You let your brother touch your friend's stuff? That's just wrong. Buy your own things. Even though you're poor. Let's go. Doesn't she stink a bit? Smells like sweat. - Must've not washed up after gym. - You smelled it too? - She's staring at us. - I thought it was just me. Oh, really? It's okay. Kids can get hurt playing. I'll call you before I leave. Thanks a lot. Bye! What's with Yeon-ho again? Yeon-ho hit Yoon again? We'd better tell them not to wrestle anymore. I can't stand him! He's dead! Sun? What did you say? Don't talk like that! Sun. Is something wrong? No. Look at me. - What's wrong, sweetie? - Nothing. Is it puberty? Honey. - Sorry I'm late. - Hello, ma'am. I haven't seen you in a while. How are you? How are you, Sun? Have a seat. Jia, sit down. Coming from somewhere? It's pretty late. After church service, I picked her up from tutoring. It ends this late? I'm more tired than she is. How will you go home? It's so late. Jia's dad is coming today. He'll pick us up here. That's good. - What tutoring school do you go to? - She's still young... Grade 4 is not young! She takes English... Hey! Put it away! She stares at it all day. Jia? Want me to pack more food for the field trip? It's okay. You can share the food with Sun tomorrow. Mom. Come out to church some time. Grandma. Our pastor is really great. People come from far to listen to his sermons. I see. Take care, ma'am. - Bye, Jia! Come again. - Yes. Take care. - Hello, Mother. - Hi. - I'll take that. - What did you buy? Jia has a field trip tomorrow. Jia! How are you? Let's go. How was tutoring? Hop in. She's so young. Jia's dad must be very capable. Let's go. Okay. Ma? Get 'm. Okay. Why are you alone here? Sorry. Mom made you uncomfortable last night. It's okay. Mom packed this for us to share. Want some? You don't have to. - Is something wrong? - Huh? Is it because of last night? - Last night? - Yes. Is it because of what I saw? What did you see? I mean... Your dad's... My dad's what? I won't tell anyone. Tell anyone, what? I mean... Just say it! Han Jia! What are you doing? I don't believe you! Bora! Jia! What! Let's clear up the misunderstanding. You're always like this! It makes me mad! That's why you don't have friends! Bora! Be quiet! Brats! Come here! Hey! Let go of him! You wanna die! - Ouch! - Why you! I see. But Sun didn't do that on purpose. - Yoon got hurt badly on his neck. - It doesn't hurt. Of course it can happen when kids play. Since Yoon is the one always getting beaten, his sister got mad. And Yeon-ho's not the type to listen, right? The hospital keeps calling. I'll call you later. Okay, then. Take care. If we scold him again, she'll probably call the cops. Yoon. - Stop playing with Yeon-ho. - No way! Eat your food. Don't bring toys to the table. Take 'em inside. One, two, three! Run! Hurry! Man. I'm sorry, mom. For what? Don't be. You didn't do anything wrong. What sister would just watch her little brother get hurt? You did well. Eat this. I made it for you. '(com! Don't play there! Come here you! That comes to $1000! I told you to put the toys back! - Why don't you listen! - But Mom... Aren't you going to see Grandpa? - I wanna see Grandpa! - Oh no! Where did Yeon-ho hurt you? Tae-hee! Jia! Jia! Jia! Sun is out! Sun's the first one out. Jia! Jia! Got her! Get her out! You got out 'cuz I said so? Who should I get? Bora! Over here! She's out. Out! Bora! Catch! No! Whoa! Get her! Bora! Give me the ball! Pass it! So scary! Give it to me, Bora! Mom will kill me! Quiet! Some of your grades have dropped a lot. WORK HARDER Some of your grades have dropped a lot. - Work harder, okay? - Yes! Who ranked first this time? - Who's first? - Bora, of course! - How many did you get wrong? - Why? Bora did well, but Jia scored tops this time. Perfect! Must've done well at your old school. - Were you a top student? - Who cares? - Treat us with snacks! - Bora? What's with them? All you think about is food. Congrats. Quiet! Bora did well too. Don't worry. Placing first is not important, it's how hard you try. - Yes. - Okay then. Your parents must sign the tests. I can tell fake signatures! Dismissed! ' MOvm _ W“! vow ' s0n_. - What's with you! - Morn! I promise I'll study harder. There's no time. I have to get back to the store. - I'll study harder on my own! - Forget it! Let's go! - Then who's going to watch Yoon? - He can stay at the store with me. - That'll be hard for you. - I'll be fine. Jia goes there too. Just go for fun. - But it'll be expensive. - Don't worry about that. Or I'll get really mad! Good thing you came. Any later would've been too late. If she goes over the basics and studies ahead... She'll catch up to others soon. I heard many of her friends come here. Who? Jia. They're in the same class. I know Jia. She's so smart and studious. Do you know Bora and Min-chul? Bora and Sun were close in grade 1. - Bora attends here too? - Yes. - Excuse me. - Sure. Hello? It'll be so fun! - Hi, Mrs. Choi. - Smile. - I saw her come in. - Where's Yoon? - She never misses a class. - I'm not sure. Go look for him. And look around. Good girl. I see. Yes, of course. Bora is a conscientious student. - Me too! Please! - No. My friend lent it to me. Do mine. - I can't! - Please? Okay. There! The kids and I visited your dad. Why! Stop going there! He wanted to see them and kept calling. Stop drinking. After everything he did to Mom and me... I know. You say it every time you're drunk. Hey! Give it back! Hey! What shall I do... Thanks for letting me borrow it. But my brother spilled a bit. Sorry. It's okay. Just have it. But this is important to you. I don't need it. Keep it. Can you believe it? Why'd she have to come to our class? I told you I hated Jia from the start. - What the heck? - You liked her the most. - She's fibbing! - That's crap. Sun said that her morn made food for Jia... But Jia just threw it out. Right, Sun? Huh? You said Jia threw out your mom's food. That's not what I meant. What? She threw out food? I hate girls like that. And why does she always brag about her mom working in England? Why doesn't she live there if it's so great! - England wouldn't want her. - Exactly! Let's go. Something stinks. She came from the bathroom. Is it poop? That's disgusting. Gross. I hope it doesn't spoil. - Eat it right away at church. - I will. - Hi, Sun. - Hello, Sun. - Hello. - How was tutoring school? - Good. Did Jia go home? - She didn't come today. - What? She skipped again? Don't worry. Jia is a good student. Is Jia doing okay these days? - Why? - Just wondering. Is something wrong? She seems moody and down these days. Kids are like that. Puberty hits early. Just worried her friends will... You know... What? She was bullied by kids at her old school. - Left out and such. - Oh no! They made fun of her parents' divorce. That's why kids should be raised by parents. But her mom's abroad and her dad's busy. Abroad? No, she's not! You must've misunderstood. She says she's too busy to even call Jia. I hope nothing happens this time. Don't worry. Jia is a bright kid. - I guess. - Right. - It's probably nothing, right? - Yes. Hello? I'm at tutoring school. Bora? Hmm? Can you not tell other kids what I told you? About what? What I said about Jia. - Han Ma? - Yeah. I only told you, but how can you tell everyone? Then you shouldn't have told me. But Still... Talking about her out loud seems harsh. Look, Sun. Don't act like a goody two-shoes. That's not it. It's your fault for telling me first. But I... You're always like that! You always make me look bad! Always so nosy... You're still wearing that? - It's the bracelet I gave you. - So? Just wondering why you're still wearing it. Why? Can't I? I mean... What? You want it back? I was just asking. So why did you ask? Why are you yelling? Why act like we're close? Look at those two. You two suit each other. - They belong together. - I know! It was so annoying when Jia stuck to us like glue. - She's a loser. - How dare she stick to us? Forget ha. Just take it! Just admit you took it! No, I didn't! - Stop making me mad! - I'm the one who's mad! - It's here because you took it! - No! You wanted it! Look. I get way more allowance than you. You took it! Stop denying it! - I didn't! - Just apologize! Why should I apologize? I have nothing to be sorry for! Just admit you took it! - You're saying I stole it? - Then who else would? I didn't steal it! - Hey! - What? I wasn't going to say this... But I heard you stole pencil crayons from a store! Says who? You liar. Right, Sun? You said it. After stealing pencil crayons, this pen must be nothing. You say you're rich. Just buy it! I didn't steal it! Stop lying, Jia! So, where are you, Dad? Weren't you at the pub? Where are...
