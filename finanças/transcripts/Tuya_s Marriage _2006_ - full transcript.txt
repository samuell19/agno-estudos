Stop fighting, stop it. I'll kill him! Stop fighting, stop it. I'll kill him! He said I have two fathers! I'll kill him! Bastards! All of you! You think I'm scared of you, huh? Leave me alone. If not for me then think about Tuya. Leave me alone. Tuya! Where are you? Come quick! Zhaya, Zhaya. See if your mother's back? She's still not back. Keep looking, there's a cold snap today. I'm keeping a close watch. Zhaya. Zhaya. Get the sheep into the pen. Hurry. Who's that guy? I told you to get the sheep into the pen. 28, 29, 30, 31, 32. 33, 34, 35, 36... Zhaya, Zhaya. Zhaya, get me a bottle of wine. Yeah. - Who is he? - Can't you see for yourself? He got drunk again. Give it here, go count the sheep. I'm staying. Go. Sarina, don't go, please, I got money. Look close, who's your Sarina? No divorce, please, please don't go, okay? Sarina, Sarina, Sarina. You done yet? You got the wrong person. Looks like... your wife's sleeping with another man. Might as well get divorced and get it the hell over with. Is Baorao asleep? She's sleeping. Did Shenge get drunk again? Got drunk, fell off his motorcycle what a pain. Is he alright? He'll live, wife ran off with others again. He thought I was his wife and grabbed me. I'm all tired out. Those two always have problems, why are they always fighting? Who knows. His wife wants to leave him. I think they should just get divorce and be done with it. We lost three sheep today. We lost three 360 yuan per sheep, 3 sheep is how much? Zhaya. What do we send you to school for? Tuya. Your mom's tired. Take her shoes off. She's exhausted. Digging that well crippled your dad. There's no real man of the house anymore. So you've got to be a man now. Shenge is here. Don't talk to him. So, you sober? Yeah, I'm sober, my wife came back, too. She told me to bring you these sheep. You can take your sheep back. Batoer said you lost three sheep while helping me. We don't want your sheep. My family will survive without three sheep. Take the sheep back, make your wife happy. So she won't run off again. With my wife, you think a few sheep will make her happy? Already promised her a truck so she would stay with me. Then sell the sheep and get the truck. Tuya. Tuya. A flock this big isn't easy on your mom. Did your mom hit you? No. If nobody hit you, then why the long face? She won't let me talk to you. Tuya, If you really don't want the sheep, guess I'll get my truck. Go get your truck. With a truck it'll only be easier for your wife to run off again. I know what you need. A man. Zhaya. Hurry up. In a sec. Let's go. The waterhole is low. The jujube leaves turned yellow from the dryness. It used to be one load a day and a 15 kilometer walk. Now it's two loads, which is 30 km what are we going to do with no water? I wanted to dig that well three years ago. Stop it, you hurt your leg before you could finish. Find a man to help carry the water. Look for a man? If I get a man, then what about you? I'll live with my sister. She already has a bunch of kids and her husband died young. That would kill her. Shenge, Zhaya has been fighting at school. He beat some classmates up a few times. His teacher said you put him up to it. Few more fights and he'll be a man. What man, a few more fights and he'll be a thug. If somebody bullies you, what would you do? You want to bully me? Just try. Tuya, where are you going? To buy hay. You're dressed so pretty. I thought you were going to see your groom. I'll help you carry the hay. Consider it an apology, okay? It's not much of an apology. I'm going to sell everything I got and buy a truck, become a boss. Going to sell this three-wheeler too, it'll belong to someone else's soon. Don't let it go to waste. I can't afford your transport fee. I don't want your money. I'm going to be rich, do good deeds. You're not going to be rich, you're just going nuts. You got yourself a screw loose. Why do you say that? Your wife doesn't love you. She loves the truck, she loves the money. What's wrong with loving money and truck? With a truck I'll have money and she'll have to love me, right? Men make it, women spend it. That's the deal, right? Just wait until I get a truck, get rich. The tables will turn... I'll marry a young pretty college student. Enough already. So, what are you still doing with Batoer? That's my business. You're still young, a good woman. Not bad looking either. You're just going to keep on struggling. What's your plan? What plan, he's still my husband. He's your husband because you married him. You marry someone else. And someone else will be your man. In the end it just a wedding certificate? Stop the car. You go ahead, I'll pay you later. Go ahead. Shenge. I'm ok, it's just my leg's caught. Shenge, are you ok? I'm ok, my leg's caught. No, no, my leg's stuck. Tuya, Tuya. You alright? Is anyone hurt? Shenge's leg is caught. Hurry. One, two, one, two. One, two, one, two. One, two, one, two. Tuya, he's out, phew! Your sister-in-law got some big problems. How bad is it? She might not be able to do hard labor, riding or herding. What kind of shepherd is that? It's from long-term lumbar fatigue. This time the sudden downward pressure. Caused a serious lumbar dislocation. If it continues to slip further. Her lower legs might become paralyzed. She'd be just like Batoer then. Who's Batoer? My brother. No one on earth would tell their sister-in-law to get a divorce. But you and Batoer should get divorced. I can take care of him. I have six kids. I can handle another mouth to feed. But if you collapse. And there's four more mouths. If it doesn't kill me, then it would. What did Batoer say? Batoer said he just wants to run to the desert, die and be done with it. I said: Hey, if you could stand and walk. Me and Tuya would be tickled pink. The only way I'll leave him is, if I end up worse than him. Isn't it bad enough as it is? Give me a drink. - Can you drink here? - It's fine. Then drink, poor Tuya. It'll numb the pain a bit. After my husband died my back hurt too. Somebody gave me a bottle of liquor. I drank it in one gulp. I slept for three whole days. Afterwards if my back hurt. I'd have a drink. Later even if my back didn't hurt I'd still drink. I'm raising six by myself. With no man. If I didn't drink, I really don't know how I would get by. Zhaya, I used to be good at riding got first place a bunch of times. Where did my parents go? They went to town to take care of something. - What thing? - Something. Are they getting a divorce? This is a voluntary divorce. So family property issues. Will be negotiated between both parties. - Correct? - Yes. Since this is the case, the court won't intervene. However, Batoer is physically disabled. Regarding his future care, who will be responsible? Batoer will stay with me. The two kids with Tuya. Batoer will stay with me, too. Tuya, what are you thinking? Batoer will stay with me. Then why get divorced? I will find a man to help me take care of Batoer. Is that man going to agree? Will he be willing? Regardless, if he'll help me with Batoer, I'll marry him. Hello. Where's Tuya's house? Who's asking? You're Tuya, right? What is it? Come down. Everyone says fate brings lovers together. We are here to propose on behalf of Puribu. A courthouse friend told us about you. We're here cause we admire your character. That's right. We thought taking care of Batoer. Could have been discussed further. Of course we could take Batoer. And place him in an elderly home. But then there are both his parents. Plus his three children. Plus you and your two kids. There's nine in total. Under Puribu's circumstances, this is too difficult. I hope you can understand our hardship. What do you say Uncle Nashen? How about it? Tuya? No matter the case, I am taking Batoer. Didn't the court people tell you? How do we get to Tuya's? Who's asking? We came to propose? She lives over there. Batoer, do you think I'm old? You're not old. I am old. There were six groups today but no one wanted me. It's me they didn't want. Well if they want me, they've to want you. This afternoon there was a man that came to propose. I thought it was for himself. Finally I realized it was for his father. How old is he? He's 64, a retired teacher. He has a pension, insurance and a large three bedroom apartment. He can also tutor Baorao and Zhaya. Maybe they can even go to college someday. Should I do it? Don't marry him. Shenge. Shenge. Shenge. Shenge, Shenge. Zhaya, go get your mother, hurry. - Tuya. - Mom, Mom. More suitors again. Mom. - Mom. - Tuya. Tuya, I got my new truck. Mom, Shenge bought a new truck. Shenge is gonna take me out for a ride! Tuya, it's my new truck. I'm going out with Shenge! Hello, comrades! Hello Chairman. Hard work my comrades. Serve the people. So, is she happy now? With this truck, she can ran off with whoever she wants for all I care. Stop boasting, others have planes, you know? I'll buy a plane, too. My wife wants me to work with this other guy. I'll be the driver and he'll bring in jobs. Oh yeah, what will your wife do? She enjoys the good life. Tuya. I don't want to be a herdsman anymore. I'm gonna move soon. No matter where I go. Just remember, you have me as a friend I don't have much else. If you ever need to use this truck. You just tell me. Next year I'll move all the hay for your family. Free transport, no money. You count on it. Tuya. I'm Baolier. Who? Baolier. Which Baolier? Recognize me now? I was your classmate in middle school, Baolier. Baolier. Baolier, what are you doing here? I came to look for oil. I'm in the oil business now. How have you been all this times? Alright. You? I'm alright, too. The first well I dug had no oil. I lost 1,000,000 yuan. And half of my hair. The second well, no oil. I owed a ton of money. Third well, still no oil. Without a second thought my wife divorced me. I took out a loan and gave out small, private loans to dig my fifth well. No, no, no, it was my fourth well. Still no oil. I had enough and climbed to the top of the oil derrick. Just when I was about to jump. My god, the sky was so blue that day I paused for a moment. The sky suddenly changed. Black clouds began to bellow up. I looked down again. Low and behold, oil was spurting out of my well. From that I came up with my life motto. People kill each other everyday. But you can't commit suicide. Live, live! Life is good, we should live. My brother here, you can't tell by looking at him now. But he used to be admired by everyone. Back during the big Mongolian wrestling competition. There were 512 competitors. He plowed right through everyone. And took first place. You cleaned my clock pretty good too. You remember? You also competed? Wasn't it because I give Tuya a 15 cent soda. You knocked me over and beat me pretty bad. You see this tooth, it's still crooked. Your tooth was always crooked. This one time I went with this official to Macao to gamble. It had to do with the oil business. Suddenly I heard the Mongolian Music. I was so moved that tears just started coming down I have been all over the world. But it's home that's close to my heart. It's hometown people who are good. I've had delicacies of all kinds, still the simple diet of home is best. Mongolian roast lamb, is so good. You only think of food. You know what it's like for a man to move around trying to make a living? You know what home means to him? Tuya, Batoer, I drink to you two. You are the idols of my youth. Tonight let's drink and rest, cheers. Cheers. Out there people are so cold. Coming home was the right thing to do. Baolier, Baolier. Baolier. Baolier. Baolier, you're up early? I've been up for a while. Batoer got hurt digging this well, right? He hurt himself before he reached the water. It can only be used as a reservoir now. How many loads do you carry a day? About two or three loads. That's tough. How deep do you have to dig to get any water here? If you're thinking about digging for oil here. You'll just loose another million. I actually came to propose to you. Why don't you go inside and have some milk tea. As soon as I heard you got a divorce I came right back right away. You still haven't sobered up yet? I was never drunk. I've waited 17 years to say this. Do you know how long 17 years is? Think about it I'll wait for your response. I've found this nursing home for Batoer. It's the best in town. First see if he likes it. Then we can go from there. Zhaya and Baorao will be able to attend top schools I've already spoken with all the principals over there. Afterwards you can come to live with me. See if you can get used to it. Anyways, that's after everyone is taken care of. We can discuss future plans later. What do you say? Huh, Baoter? I've never been this far away before. In the front section of the nursing home are the welfare residents. Welfare residents are from different govenment offices. Which are supported by the state. Private residents live in the back section of the home. They're usually wealthy company heads. Or their relatives and such. Therefore their facilities are better than the front section's. This is a standard room, it has beds. Friends and relatives can stay on visits. And can order meals over the phone. There is hot water for showering 24 hours a day. The environment and sanitation are rather nice. It so happens that today's is one of resident's birthday. Let me introduce everyone. Today we have a new friend. His name is. Batoer. Batoer is Mr. Bao's relative. He's my brother. Oh, he's your brother. Today Baoter has happened upon Mr. Chang's birthday. Let's all invite Batoer to give us a little performance. Let's welcome. What are you doing here? I am waiting for someone. Waiting for who? I'm looking for my truck. Your truck. It's gone. My wife said she was going with the car dealer to do some paper work. Now the car dealer is missing. How long has it been? Seven, eight days. Then she ran off with somebody else. Can you find your truck here? I'm keeping watch here. They could have buried my truck. How are you going to sleep tonight? I got my overcoat. I'll just lean up against my horse. That way I won't freeze. What about food? I'm not really in the mood to eat. Shenge, take this money. I don't need it. Come on, take it. Tuya, Tuya. Who's this? This is my neighbor. - Does he need money? - No, It's okay. - Take it, come on. - No, no need. I said take it. I'm Baolier. I'm Tuya's old classmate. If you have a problem just give me a call. Tuya, I'll wait for you in the car. Why don't you go see Batoer at the nursing home tonight? You can sleep there and look for your truck later. What? Batoer's in a nursing home. So, who's this guy? What about Zhaya and Baorao? They're sleeping in the car. Take this money. I don't want it. Take it, go see Batoer at the nursing home. And get a good night rest. If you freeze out here, no one can help you. I've gotta go. Tuya. Are you running off with that guy? I'm not your wife. We're getting married. Do you think we can stop for a second. My head hurts. We're still about 500 or 600 km away from my house in the capital. Why don't we first find a hotel and stay a night. Wait for you to get better then leave tomorrow. Is it easy to find? Very easy. I've pretty much stayed at all the hotels on this road. When my wife left. She took everything in the house with her. She didn't even leave me any cutlery or plates. After I struck oil. She showed up wanting to get remarried. I flat out said no. How is she now? She opened a little shop of her own. My daughter lives with her. Every month I still send them money. Now I live alone in a big country house. It's cold, quiet and lonely. Later on when you and your kids move in, our house will be lively. I'll be able to provide a good life for you. Where is Zhaya? What are you smiling about? I'm not quite used to you without your glasses. You'll get used to it over time. Where are the kids? They're sleeping next door. I haven't drunk or ridden a horse in three years. Drink. No wife, no kids. Who are you saving up for? My wife ran off with somebody else. Because she loves them, she love money. Your wife is with someone else but she cares for you, loves you. Tuya left with the kids. I wonder where they are now. Doesn't matter, they are all sleeping by now. Baolier, promise me one thing. I promise. Let Batoer live with us everything else doesn't matter. How can I do that? I have a reputation to uphold. I would be the laughing stock. How could I face people on the street? Putting Batoer in that nursing home is the same as killing him. It's the same thing. Just like letting Batoer stay with us would be like killing me. Tuya, why don't we give him some money. Let him go back and build a house. Find someone to take care of him. Or better yet! Find him a wife. Then he can live as he likes. I don't know Baolier very well. How he'll treat her, I don't know either. Good stuff. Aren't you being a bit aggressive? If I'm not aggressive tonight, then I'm not really a man, am I? You want to take advantage of me, just try and see. Mom, mom. What is it? Mom, what are you doing? I'm coming right over. If you really want to do this with a woman, it's better when she's willing. I'll stay with you, but in the future let my sister stay with Dad. Why do you want that? I'm afraid that someone bully you. Who is it? This is Shenge. I'm a friend of Tuya. What is it? Batoer is hurt, Batoer is hurt. Tell Tuya to come to the emergency room quick! Is he gonna make it? Batoer slit his wrists. Tell Tuya to come to the phone. Tuya is sleeping with the kids. The hospital won't save him for free. No matter what, they got to save him first. Hurry and put Tuya on the phone. Where are you all? Hello, hello. Hello. Tell Tuya to come to the phone. - Hello. - Hello. My signal is bad, I can't hear you. The hospital won't save him for free. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello Looking for love tonight, Mr.?

You shouldn't always send the kids out there It's not very polite? When has Sen'ge done anything that works out? His wife left him for another man he lost his truck And he's made our house a complete mess The fact that I haven't yelled at him is enough Now I should be polite? After the well is finished we can use it too Still no water yet Right? Zhaya.
