Rollin', rollin' down the road I'm feeling fine. I got the windows down driving through this town. Left all my problems far behind. Cruisin' Hittin' all the stops along the way. Wavin' at my friends, hope it never ends Gotta keep on moving night and day. Running down the road. I'll never be too old. And if you feel like running too Just get your baby in the mood to roll. Kev, what's going on man? Where you guys going to? Movies, Yong Gi is playing. Then we're going to Lover's Lane. How long ya gonna be up there? You headed straight up there? Okay, will see you guys up there. If you feel like running too, Just your baby in the mood to roll. I gotta go, it's late. I heard Sarah's a moaner, I didn't know she was a screamer too. He looks like he'd be lucky to get her breathing heavy. You guys are real funny. What was the dog pound closed, and you didn't have dates tonight? Hey, what's wrong with you? You don't wanna mess with him, his dad is a karate instructor. He'd kick your ass to Indianapolis and back. Spike, it's Kevin. Hey listen man, I don't want any trouble. I'll get you later. There's only like two of them. He can handle it. I say let's go man. Yeah, I'm getting tired of this scene anyway. I was going over to the diner to get something to eat. Come in. Morning, sensei. Good morning, Carl. Bout ready to get started? Soon as the students get here. Good morning, Olympic Karate Studios. You're not so tough, Mr. Ford. In fact, I think you're a punk. Who is this? I'm doing the talking. I'm gonna fight you for it. Why don't you come over the studio and we'll talk about it? No way. You'll see me soon enough. I'm dead serious. I can't accommodate you. You'll find the time. I'll make sure of that, just so you'll know how serious I am. Left a body for ya on Highway 40. Look buddy, I really don't have time to mess with you. I don't know what your problem is. What was that all about, Sensei? Just a prank call? You said you're ready? Yes, Sir. Good morning everyone. Good morning, sir. And as always, we want to start with a little bit of exercise, so we separate. First we take one step back, two steps back One, two. And starting with the next, please. Kevin, hi. See you later on. Sure, 7:30 or so? Alright see ya later then. OK, great. He did what? And then he drove up over the steps of the assembly area, jumped the curb, headed for the soda shop, going the wrong way down a one way street. I'll deal with him tonight. If the sheriff seen it, he'd have been mighty upset. It won't happen again. I promise. Thanks for calling Sam. Hey man, what up? Hey Spike, what's happening. Karate time. Thought classes cramped your style. A guy's gotta stay on top of things if he wants to own his own karate school. OK, everybody down like you're riding a tricycle. Good knees up. Hands on top of your knees, and on my count, we're going to fall to the left, so everybody understand? Ready. Ichi. Up. Ni. Up. San. Up. Ni. Up. San. Up. Shi. Up! Go! So what's going on with you and Spike, Dolly? Seeing a lot of each other lately. No different from you and Kevin. He's nice to me. Maybe you can get him to get a haircut. I like the way his hair is. It's... unique. He's over at the karate school with Kevin. I'm going over, you wanna come along? Ugh, homework. Gotta go, I'll see you guys at school tomorrow. Good. Ni. San. What's wrong? Looks like you've seen a ghost. Someone was following me. Following you? Hello, Sarah. What's wrong? She said someone was following her. Following you, who? A man, I think. He was big and it was dark. He was following me, so I ran. Everything is OK now. We should take her to my office. Sure, dad. OK, everybody back in place, where we were. Ichi. You know better than to walk around here at night by yourself. Sure it wasn't Benny the wino? You know he hangs out here an awful lot. I don't know. OK mom's gonna be here a little bit. I'll just give you a ride home alright? Rah! Vagrant bum. So how was your day? Where's Kevin? He's upstairs, I think. I don't know, why? Sam called me again. Said Kevin went four-wheeling across the courthouse pavilion. That crazy kid. What are we gonna do about this? I think he's going to be walking for a while. The City Council today approved a bill that clears the way for a two year, $1M renovation of the city's water main system. The century-old system has had many north-side customers complaining of faulty service in sub-zero temperatures. The bill has surfaced repeatedly in the past five years, but only today was a council swayed, by a vote of five to four. A public meeting will be scheduled next week to discuss proposed storm drainage construction along Highway 52, south of Greenfield. Department of Transportation officials say the runoffs annually cause flash flooding in that area. Joni? Police are investigating the death of a young boy whose body was found near Highway 40 in an area known as Lover's Lane. Police report Thomas Baker, 17, died of massive internal injuries. The coroner's office indicates the boy suffered a broken spine and neck. Since the boy's body was found, more than 250 yards from the main roadway, police are investigating the death as a homicide. Channel 7 will have further information on this story as it becomes available. Dad, I know that kid, I saw him last night out at Lover's Lane. What were you doing at Lover's Lane? I thought you was over at Sarah's? Well we went for a ride, and some of the kids were going and well, Well anyways, that kid Tommy Baker started messing with the truck. And I got into a fight. Did you use karate? Did you use karate? I swear. I knocked him down. He got back up I left, he was OK, honest. Listen. I don't want you four-wheeling across the plaza, and I don't want you using karate unless it's absolutely necessary. Finish your homework and go on to bed. Yes, Sir. Honey, is there something wrong? Some looney called me at the school today. Said he wanted to fight me. But he wouldn't come over the school. And wouldn't even tell me his name. Honey, lots of people have wanted to fight you. There's something different about this guy. He sounds. Strange. And then the boy they found out in Lover's Lane. Tommy Baker? I heard about that on the radio this evening when I was coming to pick you up. God, it's terrible. So young. And then Kevin. What about Kevin? Oh nothing, he was great with the young students tonight. Have you noticed the increase in attendance lately? I sure have, it's getting crowded out there. Maybe we should build on. Do you think it's because the murder of Tommy Baker? Well, people I know are really scared. Things like this just don't happen around here. Hey Kevin, heard you and Baker got into a little fight the other night. He sure did. I was there. He was fine when I left him. Sure ya didn't sneak back later and finish the job? Come on man. No, that's alright. Let these idiots think what they want. I know what happened. You and your karate jazz. You think you're so bad? All right, get on back to your classes now. Hey, you didn't like snuff the guy did you? No, man. He was fine when I left him. Alright cool. Let's cruise. Kevin! Hi, Spike. Can you go to the festival? I don't know. My father is still pretty mad. Maybe I can talk him into letting me go. Later, man. Kevin? Kevin, you didn't go back that night? Not you too. You were there. He was ok. Dome of those kids are saying- I don't care what some of the kids were saying. He was fine when I left him and I never saw him again. And I believe you. I can see you. It's 8:30, something's wrong. Maybe she went shopping. She would have called. I'll call the sheriff, see if he'll run us home. Check. Sheriff's Office. Yeah, sure, I'll be right over. It's Tom Ford. He and his son need a ride home. His wife was supposed to pick him up, but she must had car trouble. Wanna ride along? No, I think I'll stay here. Oh, checkmate. Sorry Jim, hate to bother you like this. It's no bother. What are friends for? She probably just broke down someplace along the road. I hope you're right. Well, the car's still here and the lights are on. Listen, why don't you just sit tight? Let me check it out. Judy? Tom! Car number one to base, dispatch an ambulance to Tom Ford's house. Do something, Dad! Do something for her! Doctor Jenny... Right now she's holding her own. But her condition is very critical. We're doing absolutely everything we can. But unfortunately she has massive internal injuries. And it doesn't look good. Can we see her? Certainly, but just for a few minutes. Mr. Ford? Yes? You can go in now. Doctor Jenny, Doctor Clifford... Doctor says you're gonna be alright. You're making progress. I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to leave now. I can't, she needs me here. We'll take good care of her. Why don't you go on home for the night? Where was this taken? At the Great Lakes. On our honeymoon. She sure was pretty. She sure is. Who would want to hurt Mom? I dunno, son. Night, Dad. Hello. You ok? I heard- Yes it is. Dad who was it? Your mother just died. [Eulogy in the distance] Since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we shall always be with the Lord. Therefore comfort one another our father in heaven we do come to you at this time, to ask that you might be that source of comfort that the apostle Paul spoke of. We pray that comfort might be available to Tom the rest of the family pray also that you might grasp through them strength and encouragement ...we pray to Jesus... It's only been a short time since you left me here. Now I'm really all alone. You only left me 'cause you had to. But if I had only known. It was the memory that caused me grief. When I shut off the light and go to bed. And all the good times that you gave me. Start spinning around inside my head. If I just can't seem to understand why, our hearts can't be as one. Maybe I'll get over losing you. And softly kiss these lonely tears goodbye. Along with the memories that cause me grief, When I shut out the light and go to bed. And all the good times that you gave me Stop spinning around inside my head. Along with the memories that cause me grief, When I shut out the light and go to bed. And all the good times that you give me. Stop spinning around inside my head. How can you just sit there? Let's go after him. It's not our job. It's not our job just to sit here either. Mom would have wanted us to go after him. Why do you teach self defense? I don't teach people to seek revenge. You're afraid! You're afraid you'll be beat. Well I'm not afraid I'm going after him, and you and all your awards are nothing! Whenever I'm sad, whenever I'm blue, whenever I'm feeling low. I dream of your face and then... I'm up in the clouds with you. Kevin. Sup, man? Ah, nothing. You look worried, Kevin. Look, I'm fine, OK? I don't want to talk. Lighten up. It's OK you don't have to talk about it. We're just your friends. We don't care if you come here bummed out. We'll sit here and bum out with you. Yeah, we'll all just sit here and get real depressed with Kevin. Spike! No. That's OK, look, Spike's right. Sorry I'm not feeling real well, I'm going on home. I'll talk to you guys later. Oh man. As long as you always love me Anybody home? Hey Tom. I saw your car out there, thought I'd stop by and see if there's anything I can do. What are these? Someone's idea of a bad joke. I'm sorry, Tom. Can I keep these? Sure, take them. Maybe you wanna take a little time off, get away from this place, spend some time with your son. Can you just take off from your job? Not quite the same thing. When you plan on opening up? First thing tomorrow morning. Don't push yourself too hard Tom. I can take some of your classes. I may be a little rusty, but I remember most of what you taught me. I'll call you if I need anything. Here, try those on. Here's a shirt. Let's go shoot some baskets. You know you got to think about how your old man feels. I mean. If he was to go after this guy just to get even. How could he ever go in front of a class for the karate students, and teach him the way he thinks is right? I don't know. Tell you what, why don't you crash over here at my house tonight? You could use a little time to think, couldn't you? Yeah, I'm not ready to go home yet. Cool. Come on, chow time! Grandma! sit down, let's talk. I've been worried about you all night. You know, I've been thinking about what I said. I know you're not a coward. I just never felt so much hurt and hatred in my entire life. Love Mom and you so much. I'm sorry, Dad. Right here, c'mon. That's it. Harder. Movement. Good. Now let's spar, okay? Head up. You know the festival's this weekend? Are we going? Sure, I don't see why not? What you reading?. An article about Ninja Warriors. Thought you didn't agree with combat-style karate? Just because I don't teach it, doesn't mean it can't read about it. Well, I'm going to bed. I'm right behind you. Oh trouble spirit be not afraid. I am here to guide you. Peace makes dreams. You are not at peace, so this cannot be a dream. Know that I will give you strength to conquer he who brings you pain and sorrow. Your heart is good. What you do is right. Be patient and be ready. You will shall have but one chance. Behold, I saw, that others may see light. Seek not death, but peace. It's the robe I goy you for Christmas. Yeah, it's real nice. You OK? Don't look like you're feeling very well. I had this... This vision last night. This ninja warrior was in my room. Dad, please call the doctor. Get something to help you sleep. I know what I saw. I'll wait at the car. You are having classes today, aren't you? His name is William Otis Kelly. He's a world class professional wrestler. Call him The Bear. Couple years ago he went for berserk in a match in New York, killed his opponent and injured some of his fans. They sent him to a federal penitentiary, then later to the federal psych unit here. They brought him here, kept him overnight while the feds got the paperwork together, and he's escaped from my table. The government wanted it kept quiet. They didn't want a panic. I didn't agree with them, but there was nothing I could do. I started to suspect him with the Baker boy's death. And they call him The Bear? Because that's how he defeated his opponents, with a bear hug. This man is so big and so strong, and once he got his arms around them was all over. They couldn't breathe, they just passed out. The Baker boy, your wife? Yeah, that's where they died. They were all crushed by an incredibly strong man. They died of massive internal injuries. A guy this big and no one's seen him? The only people who saw him didn't live to tell about it. That's why I came by to give you this to show you what he looks like. If we can't catch him, you're the only man that can. I don't know how the government feels about this, but this is my town. These people are my friends and I'm going to do everything I can to protect them. But I need your help. Looks like he's picked you for his next match. Hey Sheriff, sorry to interrupt, but the students are here. Are you ready? No, I won't be there. Ask Carl if he'll take my classes for a couple of days. What are you gonna do? I'll be working out. I need to improve my speed, my timing and my technique. Before the World Championships? Something like that. Well. Let me know if you hear from him. If you need any help, just call. I'll be around. Don't tell anybody else about this, Jim. I really don't like being involved with this guy. I don't want the whole town to know. Right. [Grunting noises] Hi. Hi, need a ride? No thanks. I'm close to home, and I enjoy the fresh air. Well, you know, it's it's really not safe out here for girl by herself. Sure you don't wanna ride? No, that's alright, thanks anyway. OK, bye bye. Look. It's past midnight and he's working out. I heard he's been that way ever since his wife was killed. Dad! Are you OK? Oh, I feel great. Best sleep I've had in years. I saw you laying there and I thought- Well, I'm glad you're OK. So that's what this is all about. Think he'll come after you? I'm not sure. Sheriff promised me he wouldn't say anything to anybody, and here is in the paper. Hey Tom. Jim! I thought we had an understanding. What happened? I'm sorry Tom. Somebody in the state crime lab let it out. Olympic Karate Studios. You told the police everything! More people will die! Leave this town alone. I'll have my own festival, a festival of death! Stop killing innocent people. Let us help you. You need help! I'm not afraid of anyone. And everyone's afraid of me. Since you tell the sheriff everything, Tell him that after he gets done with a girl, there's another body waiting for him at the gas station east of town. But there's no hurry. You'll hang around until he gets there. What girl? What was that all about? He said there's another body at the gas station, east town, Better get out there. Wait a minute, what's this about a girl? Mary Lucas's body was found this morning. I saw her walking home last night from class. Offered her a ride. What'd you do that for? Everybody likes the festival. Festival Days, that's what he meant! What are you going to do? The only thing I can - wait. I'm going home. You and Carl can handle the classes. I'll pick you up after class tonight. Now we all know about this guy. We think probably the next place that he'll strike is out at the festival. If you spot him, don't try to take him by yourself. Call for backup, and if you get that call, no matter what you're doing, respond immediately. Yeah? What if there's no time to call for help? You know the Lord's Prayer? Seriously? Don't be a hero. Be careful. Alright, that's it. Hi, Dad. Hi, sheriff. Hi, son. Hello, Spike. Hey guys. Can I spend the night at Spike's house tonight? Sure we're gonna stick around and work out for a little while. He needs to exercise and I need a good sparring partner. He's right about the exercise, but he's not going to have much competition. Here you take the car. Jim can take me home. And get something to eat. Have you eaten? No. Chow time! We're heading to the diner you want us to bring you something? We'll eat after we work out. OK, well, we'll see you in the morning? So long guys. I think that's enough for tonight. What do you say we shower and get something to eat? But I'm just getting warmed up. You do this every day. I'm lucky to get this much exercise in a week. What's the matter, Tom? It's a feeling. It's nothing I can hear, or see. I just have this feeling we're being watched. You know what I mean? You know what, you're getting jittery? But so am I. You're starting to think like a cop. I mean, we just automatically expect the worst. You like police work, sheriff? Generally, I guess it's like most jobs, some days are better than others. What bothers me are traffic fatalities or murder scenes, times like that I want to hang it up, but there could be some very rewarding moments too. Have you ever killed anybody? Not as a policeman. In the war. Over there, it was sort of them against me. I didn't have much choice. When you don't have a choice, Tom, it isn't wrong. Now the festival starts tomorrow morning. You heard from him again? No, but I wish I would. Maybe I can get him to turn himself in. You just don't understand, do you, Tom? You can't talk sense with a man like this because he doesn't want to be reasonable. Killing people is his way of releasing anger. Anger? Anger at what? How can anybody become so angry that they'll take another person's life? Who knows what triggers off somebody like this? I mean he doesn't think like a normal man, he doesn't react like normal? He isn't a normal man. What's it gonna take to make him stop? I don't know. Bullet maybe? Wish I had brought my walkie talkie, Sheriff, I saw your car out front. It's Tom Ford- Tom, your house is on fire. Ok now, thanks. Chief doesn't think it was an accident, Tom. The whole place was torn up and then set on fire. I told you Tom, you can't reason with a man like this. Whoever is in there, better come out now. Better come out now, or I'm gonna call the police. Man. Pardon me. OK, here we go. Sorry, you had to wait folks, Sam usually has it open by now. Go ahead and set up the exhibit. I'll see if I can find him. Sam? Sheriff? Yeah? What are you doing here? I was looking for Sam. Oh he's probably stepped out for breakfast. We need you to show us where the exhibitors can set up their campers for the night. Somebody screwed up the assignment sheet and we don't know where the spaces are. Figures. Handle it for me, I gotta find Sam. I'll take care of it. I want you to be careful today. And don't leave the festival unless you tell me. OK, I told Spike and the girls gonna meet them for the parade. It's gonna start here in a few minutes. Meet me back at the car at three o'clock. Alright, OK, I'll see you. Owner. Hey. Tom, have you seen Sam? No I haven't. But I know a killer's here someplace. You know that feeling I had last night? I know he's here someplace- he was watching us before he set the fire, and he's here someplace watching us now. I'm gonna check around inside for Sam. Why don't you check out here? And if you see anything don't do anything. Sam? Spellman to base - dead body in the elevator at the courthouse. If you could lift the wrap a notch, I'd worry day by day. Infinity's reality gives me a place to play. Cause I could write the song that turn your world around. I could make your children dance, lift their feet up off the ground. Give you my world, Give you my world. Give you my world. If I could give you everything would you take it all from me? Show you how to fly, would you use it willingly? Or would you just sit there Never taking chances, never learning how to fall? Give you my world. Give you my world. Let me help you! Aggh! Now you freeze right there or I'm gonna blow you apart. The gun's empty. Would you show me good from bad? I would share my world with you, make your fantasies come true. Give you my world. Give you my world. Give you my world. Yeah, yeah! Give you my world. Give you my world. I'd give you my world. [Screams] Look! It's up there! Look! Look up there! Let's go. Hey, look out. Bummer! Hey man, is there another way to the top? No, this is it. Deal with it. Sheriff, can you hear me? Sheriff? Can you read me? Come in please. Do you have a nice little nap, sheriff? Nice view, isn't it, sheriff? I want you to see my finale. In fact, you're gonna be a part of it. I know you'll be a big hit. Kill me, my men will gun you down. So what? Better than being an experimental rat with those stupid doctors in the hospital! Hey! Well! if it isn't the little kid, and his dumb sidekick! This is gonna be better than I thought. Let him go! Sure, kid. I'll let him go... Tag team time. Hey man, he's too big! Run! We gotta get help. How'd you get in here? Let's take stairs. They don't go all the way to the clock tower. The elevator's the only way up. We're getting out of here. What happened? Tom, is that you? Look out! Seek not death. Seek only peace. Why don't you kill me? Go ahead. Break it. Take off the mask, lemme know who I'm thanking. Sheriff, are you OK? I wouldn't have been if it hadn't been for my hooded friend here. Hooded friend? Get the sheriff to hospital. Agh! Where are the Fords? They're over there in the lobby. Hey, everybody. Hi, Sheriff. Hi, Jim. Just in time for pizza. Oh well, thank you. I don't really have time. I just came by to see how everybody's doing. What happened to you? Got a little close to the festival activities. I heard about you and Kel. Yeah, he put on quite a show. He's a real mental case. I think they're gonna lock him up for a long time. So you're going to rebuild your house? Yes, just as soon as the insurance check comes in. Gonna be even be bigger, with a sauna. Right, Dad? And a party room. Oh it's going to be bigger, but we'll have to talk about that party room. I went by what was left of your house. Found these and was surprised they weren't destroyed in the fire. This is terrific. Thanks Jim. I didn't think I'd ever see these again. So maybe you could use these. Well, I gotta get back to work. I'll see you later. Take care. Thanks. I'm real proud of you, dad. It's a whole new start for you. It's a whole new start for us. Outside and the rain is falling. Making its way to the stream. Flowing gently through the valleys heading for the sea and as the cool water passes. It pierces the dry thirty land Bringing life to desert places, flowers in the sand. After the rain, there will be singing. After the clouds are gone. Sunshine will break its way through darkness. Night only lasts so long. After the rain, there'll be laughter. My heart will sing a new song. Skies will be clean He will be near, after the rain. Clouds sometimes come on the inside. Sometimes they darken the day and like the raindrops, tears of sorrow fall along the way. But tears are the seeds of the morning and clouds are the sign of spring. And like a cool refreshing shower, hope will make me sing. After the rain, there'll be singing. After the clouds are gone. Sunshine will break its way through darkness. Night only lasts so long. After the rain there will be laughter. My heart will sing a new song. Skies will be clear He will be near After the rain is gone. After the rain, there'll be singing. After the clouds are gone. Sunshine will break its way through darkness Night only lasts so long. After the rain, there'll be laughter. My heart will sing a new song. Skies will be clear. He will be near, after the rain after is gone. After the rain, there will be singing. After the clouds are gone Sunshine will break its way through darkness Night only lasts so long. After the rain, there'll be laughter.
