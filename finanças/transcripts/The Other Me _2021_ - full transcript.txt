The usual? Actually, tonight let's make it an Espresso Martini. Ah. Working tonight. You know, I was just thinking that I could end my shift early. -It's pretty dead tonight. -I'm meeting a friend. Mm, wow, the more, the merrier. Your enthusiasm is unparalleled as usual, Leo. But not tonight. Well, you know where to find me if you change your mind. On second thought... ♪ I just had to realize ♪ Could I please have another? Oh, you're such a tease. Is it that good, though, huh? Remember the part when I said I was meeting a friend? Hey. -Veronica? -Vince! I'm so happy you're here. Please, join me. -Make yourself comfortable. -Thank you. Wow, it's a pleasure to finally meet you. -That for me? -To new friends. And new experiences. I like that. -Cheers. -Cheers. Hi, baby. Yeah, it looks like it's gonna be another late night. Very late. I'll see you in the morning, okay? Okay. Bye. This is nice. Don't be shy. There you go. I've actually, I've never done this before. That's okay. I have. It's about time! I have to be at the station in an hour. Thank you for the last-minute favor. Looks like someone had a good time. When do I get to meet him? We're just taking it slow, you know? Whatever happened to the bartender rebound? Oh, that was hardly a rebound. It was one time. Okay, fine. Two. Is he still hoping for more? That doesn't matter, 'cause it's not happening again. Just give me this guy's name and let me do a check. Yeah, that's exactly why I'm not giving you his name. What is the point of having a detective as a sister if I can't screen potential new suitors? I mean, we don't want a Jason part two. Hey, don't talk about him when Christine can hear. She's more grown-up than you think. Yeah, she's incredibly grown-up. Exactly, and she's old enough to know that her father is an abusive jerk. And moving back home and uprooting your lives hasn't been easy. It's been the best thing for us. I didn't say otherwise. Best doesn't mean easy. I'm just trying to get us back on the right path. I can't find my Jean jacket with the patches on it! It's drying on the rack in the laundry room. And good morning to you, too. But it's not in the laundry room! Honey, it's on the rack. It didn't just vanish into thin air. Ugh! Worst day ever! What was that you were saying about her maturity? Hm, I'll see you Friday. I promised Christine Malasadas. -You spoil her. -That's my job. See you soon. - Bye. - I found it! - Where? - On the rack! Is there anything else I can get you? That's all for now. Thank you. Okay. You guys good? Save me, Connie, you still keep a bottle of baby aspirin in your purse? -Yes. -Oh, yes. Ooh, you are an angel! My temples are throbbing so badly, I almost snapped at those last members. Late night last night? We went out to George's new bar on Kalakaua, they had this Pau Hana special. Half-off pitchers of mai tais. Sounds like you got a great deal on a migraine. Mm, you know, if drinks with the boss doesn't scare you, you should come next time. They even start karaoke at 9:00. You had me at maybe until you said karaoke. Hey, come on, it's okay to have a little fun once in a while, you know? If I ever get the time, I'll consider it. Well, we've got a new girl starting next week. -So maybe you'll get your wish. -We do? You know that Thursday afternoon that you can't give me, it's my one afternoon I promised Christine. I know, and I respect that. But since you can't do it, I gotta hire someone. And I can't just give them one shift a week. Well, why can't Michelle just keep covering it for me? No, see, she's gotta stay at the front desk at that time. Oh! How many shifts am I gonna lose? I'm barely making a living as it is, Maya. Girl, I've seen your tips, okay? I'd say you do pretty well for yourself. I don't think you understand the amount of debt my ex left us with. Ugh, the gambler? You know, I have debt collectors calling me every day. That and moving back here and raising a teenager! And I'm still in the hole from legal fees of trying to keep Jason from taking her. Look, I get it, Connie, I'll see what I can do to keep as many of your hours as possible. But then you owe me a night of mai tais! Mai tais! Okay, think about it. Aloha. This is Connie. How may I help you? -Smells great, mom. -Oh! Sorry. I thought you heard me come in. I was just, um, zoning out. How was practice today? Kehau is still faster than me, but I'm catching up. Coach says she's really happy I joined the team, though. And the other girls have mostly stopped calling me mainland. Wait, who's doing that? Doesn't matter. I don't actually mind. What's that? Beading kit. Hey, Christine, come here. I know that this move hasn't been easy on you. -Mom. -Let me finish. I just wanna let you know how proud of you I am and how much I appreciate you being so understanding. I'd do anything for you. You know that. Right? -I love you, honey, okay? -I love you, too. Now, what do you say that tomorrow you and I go on a trail run and we'll give kehau a run for her money? Okay? Sound good? Wouldn't you like to know? Yeah, just right there, that's perfect. Connie, come meet Alison, your new trainee. -Alison? -Connie? Oh, my goodness! Uh, how are you? Uh, I thought you were living on the mainland. I was. I just moved back recently. Um, hi! How do you guys know each other? Alison and I were in the same sorority. -Delta theta. Sisters forever! -Sisters forever! Wow, that was a long time ago. Well, you haven't changed a bit. You look exactly the same. Okay, I love a good reunion, but don't forget we have work to do too. Connie's gonna show you the ropes. And then I'm gonna check on Shane. I will be back. Thanks, Maya. What a small world. When did you move back? A couple months ago. I... Jason and I, we separated. So it just made sense to move back and be closer to my sister. -Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. -Oh, don't be. I'm glad to be back. How are you? H-How have you been? -Great. -Yeah? Uh, things have been a little rough, actually. My husband passed a couple of months ago. Oh, no, that's terrible! -Yeah. -I'm so sorry. It's getting a little easier each day. -I can't even imagine. -Yeah. Well, I'm excited to be starting here. I don't really need the money, but I just thought it was time to get back out there and be around people again, you know? I didn't even know you were married. -Yeah. -I wish I would've known, al. I bet you could've used a friend. Sounds like you were going through your own stuff. Maybe we both could've used a friend. Yeah. Well, better late than never. Right? Alison, I forgot to show you how to clock in. So let me take you now while I'm showing the others. Boo! Uh, Veronica, right? I... yeah, I've just... I've never seen it spelled that way before. It... -Hm. -Not now, Leo. You know, I was just stoppin' by next-door to pick up my check and figured I'd say hi. How did you even get in here? Oh, I promised the front-desk girl some free drinks later. -What do you want? -Another chance. I told you, I'm not looking for a relationship right now. Yet you're always in my bar with some other new... interest. And you always enjoy our agreed-upon tips. Well, what if that's not enough for me anymore? Um, no, I'm sorry, we don't have happy hour on the weekends. I'm sorry, um, I must've gotten you confused with someone else. Aloha. How may I assist you? -Table for two. -Sure. Right here. Whoo! Only three minutes faster than last time. That's great! Hey, every little bit counts. Should we celebrate with zippy's for dinner? Actually, I was gonna ask if it's okay that I spend the night at Annie's tonight. Annie from the team, isn't she one of the girls that was picking on you? No one was picking on me, mom. We were all just getting to know each other. Well, I'm happy you're making friends. Is her mom cool with you spending the night? Yeah, she said she'd even pick me up. Then I don't see why not. You gonna be okay without me? I'm never okay without you, sweetheart. - Well, hello there. - Veronica? -That you, babe? -Who else would it be? I am dying to be with you again. Well, lucky for you, the wait is almost over. So we're good for ten o'clock tonight? -See you then. -Oh, yes, you will, beautiful. Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I, uh, I thought you were at, at Annie's for the night. I am! She's out front with her mom. We wanted to craft, and I forgot my beads. -Oh. -Uh, mom, what are you doing? Why are you dressed like that? Oh, just messing around. Just, uh, doing a little dress-up. -You know, girl stuff. -Okay. At some point I'm going to re-enter the dating scene and put myself back out there. -Ew. -I'm just saying. I don't know, mom, I think you're trying a little too hard. You don't need all this. You always look good. I better get going. They're waiting for me. Right. Right. Have fun. You, too. Heh-heh. This is good. Sure about that? I could go all night. - One more. - If you say so. Look, first four of a kind, then a straight flush. Seriously? I-I'm pretty confident that you're cheating me. -I'm just a lucky gal. -Yeah, I'll say. If you think about it, I'm doing you a favor. You could be hemorrhaging all your cash at a table somewhere on the Vegas strip. Ah, okay, that's true. I already lost enough money on the golf course today. And considering how much my ex is gonna take me for, I should... take any win I can get. -Wait. Lissie left you? -Yeah. Sorry, I didn't wanna put a damper on the night, but my marriage is over. Really over this time. She left last week, filed the paperwork. How do you feel about that? Hm, I definitely don't miss her. But it's weird to be alone again at my age. But you're not alone. Yeah. I owe you everything, Veronica. Oh, stop. You're making me blush. I'm serious. I need to fill your wine. I'm gonna join you for this one. -Really? -Yeah. Special occasion. Wait. Aren't you on a five-year streak? Six. Ha-ha... But, uh, sobriety was Lissie's thing, not mine. She thought I had a problem, which I didn't. But you know, that was the big problem with her. Nothing, nothing was ever good enough. Uh, no matter what I did for her, how much I gave her, it was just never enough. I'm just thankful we didn't have kids. Yeah, it's easier to cut all ties. You'd make an amazing mother, Veronica. You think you ever wanna have children? Maybe. Who knows what the future holds... Well, I hope it includes a lot more time like this. My goodness, that is good. This is gonna be good for you. Yeah, and I do love a secret tiki getaway as much as the next person, but I'm really looking forward to hosting you at my place. Or maybe our next destination is somewhere even more special. -Why don't we go to Paris? -That'd be fun. I'm serious, there is nothing in this world like Paris at midnight. I have a work trip there end of next month. -And you should join me. -Wow! Paris. Wow. I... I'll cover everything and I will pay you whatever you want for your company. I don't even think my passport's current. -I haven't traveled in a while. -I'll get that sorted out. Yeah, maybe. But we have some other things to sort out first. -Morning, sunshine. -Morning. I've got Alison sharing the shift with you this morning for training. Sounds good. -Are you feelin' okay? -Yeah. I just need this coffee to hurry up and brew. If you're having fun out on the town without me, I'll be upset! I promise, when I have a night available for that, you will be the first... Sorry. What were we talking about? Oh, you were just promising me some mai tais. Sorry, it never ends. -Oh! Who is William? -Nobody. It seems like it's somebody. I can help you text him back. -No, Maya. Please. -I was just messing around. I wouldn't read your juicy messages. Unless, of course, you wanted me to, you know, or if you weren't in the room. -You want some? -If you think you can spare any. You know, I can't believe you're dating again. -And you didn't even tell me! -It's not like that. One of these days, Connie, I’m gonna get you to relax with me. I'm the cool boss, remember? I promise you, there's nothing to share. -It's not exciting. -He seems to feel otherwise. Well, I say there's nothing to tell. Fine. I can take a hint. I'll leave you be. Cool boss out. There she is. What's going on? I'm in the middle of something. In the middle of what? Tell me about it. I'd love to hear how your day is going. William, you said this was an emergency. Yeah, I found someone who can expedite your passport. -What? -Paris. I told you we can make it work. Paris? Oh, William. This is a really bad time for me. Ah. Fine. Call me back when it's a good time. Okay? -Yeah. Okay. -Bye, Veronica. Bye. Hey, slow down. You're gonna give yourself the shakes. I could use an iv of this stuff this morning. Rough night? Just haven't been able to sleep much lately. You have to try this new tea I found. It's so much better than coffee. I'll bring some tomorrow. Oh. Aloha. How can we help you? -You can give me my family back. -I'm sorry? Jason, you're not supposed to be here. -Jason? Okay. -Go get Maya. You haven't been answering my calls, my messages. There's a reason for that. How the hell did you find where I... What else was I supposed to do? -Security? -Dammit, Connie! Hi, it's Connie. I need security to the upstairs deck. - It's gonna be okay. - How can you say that? We don't even know where he went, our security cameras didn't even see him leaving. How is that even possible? I... -You need to breathe. -Okay. How did he find me? How long has he been here? Oh, my god. I-I-I have to get Christine. You need to calm down. Okay? He's not gonna hurt Christine. I sent out an alert to the entire department. We're looking for him. You are safe. I know that look in his eye all too well. It always ends in violence. Connie, sit down. Come on, come sit down. Sit down! Come on. Did anyone else see him? My co-worker Alison. Okay. And did she see where he went? No, 'cause I sent her to get help, and that's when he started threatening me like he always does. Okay. I'll have my team watch the house tonight. Okay? It's gonna be fine. Okay. Thank you. It's okay. We got this. We got this. Pretty soon I'm not gonna be able to keep up with you. Pretty soon? I think next time I’m gonna let you train on your own. That wouldn't be as fun. Besides, the beach run is this weekend. I don't know how I let you talk me into this. It's for a good cause. -Hey, mom. -Yeah? Why was there a police car outside our house this morning? What police car? You notice everything, don't you? Well, I mean, they weren't exactly subtle. I asked your aunty Terri if they could help watch us for a little while. Why? I just wanna keep us safe. Especially you, you know? -Can you tell me the truth? -It's nothing. I don't want you to worry. Okay. Nothing I need to deal with now. -Race you to the car? -Uh... Come on, hurry up. Hello? Hello? Is that you? I know your secret! - Um, Connie. - Yeah? I wanted to apologize for the other day, with your ex. I feel like I let you down. I didn't know what you went through with him. I-If I had, I-I would've made sure he didn't get away. It's just, I know what it's like to be going through something and not have anyone understand. You have nothing to apologize for. Truth is, I don't talk about it. Maybe just 'cause I'm so ashamed that it all ever even happened. Ashamed? I was in denial for a long time. Making excuses for every drunken night, every new debt. In sickness and in health, I thought. It wasn't until I realized how much danger I was putting Christine in that I was finally able to leave. I'm so sorry. I wish I'd known. Don't be. But that's why we moved back here. That's why I bought a house on foreclosure that I still really can't afford. I want to give Christine the life she deserves. You know? I think I'm hoping to find myself again, too. I became someone else when I was with Jason. And I think I've been looking for myself again ever since. Sorry. I don't know where that came from. No, no, no. I know what you mean. It's easy to get lost trying to be the right person for everyone else. Pretending you're okay when you're not. It's like living a double life. Listen, do you wanna hang out sometime after work? We could do drinks or a bbq at my place. You can meet my daughter and my sister. I would love that. Let me get these to Maya. I'll be back. Now to deal with you. You like it? It's beautiful. Too beautiful. I don't know what to say. Here. Let me help you put it on. Uh... I can't accept this. You deserve it. - You did it. - I did. I did. I swear I did. You could ask anyone at the country club. I'll take you sometime. You can play a round or we could just get lunch. The food is surprisingly pretty decent. Well, you're really selling it well. You know, a man can have good taste, right? Speaking of... You given anymore thought to Paris? I promise you, we will have the time of our lives. Yeah, about that.. I just don't think that now is a good time. What's the problem? Hm? 'Cause I'll do anything to make it happen. I, I wanted to talk to you about something. Anything. Shoot. I wanna be here for you as much as I can, but my time is, it's a little limited right now. Because of other men? -It doesn't matter why. -So you don't deny it. We don't have an exclusive arrangement. We should. What if... What if I paid you for every hour of every day? William... -That's not how this works. -Could be. Um, William, we had an agreement. Yeah, you're right. You're right, Veronica. I'm sorry, I... I don't know what got into me. I... I guess I just didn't expect to need you so much. Maybe we should just take a little space. You-you're going through a lot with your divorce. You could use some time to process. William... Right. -William, I... -Uh, let's get out and dry off. I'll walk you out. Sorry for overstepping boundaries and bothering you so much. No, it wasn't a bother. Until we meet again. You're remembering that wrong! That wasn't me! Trust me, I could never forget. Besides, you were the only girl in our pledge class who wore five-inch platform heels to the frat house. That... okay, that, that does sound like me. Yeah, and you proudly showed them off to everyone when you danced on the kitchen table. - Oh, god! - Remember? Is that how you broke your ankle? I can neither confirm nor deny. -Mom. -Hi, sweetheart. Is, is this your little Christine? She's not so little anymore, but, yes, this is my Christine. Chris, this is my friend from college. -And now she's my coworker, too. -Hi. - Hi. - You can say more than that. -Nice to meet you. -You, too. Christine is an athlete and she's becoming quite the star player on her track team. -Oh, yeah? That's a mom's job. -She exaggerates. Mom, I'm going to sleep at Annie's again tonight. Is that the only reason why you came out here to talk to me? What, you don't want to hang out with us? Don't answer that, Chris. No one here needs hurt feelings. Okay, you can go, but remember, don't stay up too late 'cause we have the beach run in the morning. We've been training for weeks. I didn't forget. Okay, have a good night, all right, sweetie? -I love you, and be safe. -Always. She is the mini version of you. Aww, thank you. But she has my low bs tolerance, which is something our dear Connie is still working on. - Oh. - I can see that. I always wanted kids of my own, and I thought I'd have enough time to convince my husband he wanted the same. Anyway, sometimes life has different plans. But, you know, I’m, I'm finally in a place where I'm looking forward to whatever's next. - Oh. I'll drink to that. - Me, too. Cheers, ladies. - Cheers. - Cheers. Oh! So good. -Oh... -This was so fun. Definitely. I'm glad you could make it. Yeah. I could use some more girl time. I haven't really adjusted to being single yet. -It's so strange. -I know what you mean. Marriage is supposed to last forever. Yeah, I guess I didn't really expect to be alone again. You're not alone. Now we have each other. I appreciate that. -Thanks again. -Drive safe. Have a great night. Bye, Terri! Thank you! - Bye, Alison! - Bye. No, no, no, no. I got it. - Okay, okay. - You've done plenty. And I appreciate you taking the time. When was the last time we hung out like that? It's been a while. But you know what? I had a lot of fun, thanks. I think Alison had fun, too. I feel so bad for her. It was nice to spend time with her outside of work. Yeah. Speaking of work... -Anything more from Jason? -Nothing since. Okay, we're still looking for him, but we just don't have any leads yet. So Christine is gone for the night... I'm so glad she's making friends. -And you? -What do you mean? What are you gonna do with your time? I will be catching up on some sleep. Oh, so you weren't planning on seeing William and planning your Parisian vacation? How do you know about William? I'm literally a detective. That, and you left your phone on the counter. -Terri! -What? I didn't know where you were going all these nights. And you refused to talk to me about your love life. -It's none of your business. -I couldn't help it. It just kept going off. I don't appreciate you spying... Anyway, I broke it off with him, and that's why he keeps texting. Okay! For what it's worth, I just want you to be happy. But... I will stop. -Get some rest. -Planning on it. ♪ If I can't have you then I'll keep you waiting... ♪ Okay! -On the count of three? -I just wanna make it clear. This bad decision is entirely your fault. -One... -Two... -Three. -Three. Ooh. Ooh. -That hurts. -Another? Just another round of martinis. Thank you. One more to celebrate your new job offer, and then let's head upstairs. Ooh, I would love that, but that last shot just ran right through me. Let me go take care of that, and I'll be right back. ♪ Feels like forever ♪ So do mommy and daddy know he's out this late? Is he paying you from his trust fund? Hm. I'm working, Leo. Which means you are getting your cut, too. Maybe that's not enough for me anymore. What is that even supposed to mean? Connie? Oh! Oh, my gosh! -Maya! Hey! -Fancy seeing you here! Did hell just freeze over or am I actually seeing you here at a bar? My goodness, look at you! Let me buy you a drink. Oh, that's sweet, but I'm actually just getting ready to leave. Uh, sorry for the wait, Veronica. Here you go. -What did he just call you? -I don't know. These guys don't remember names. Are you here with someone? No. I... -Oh, oh... -Uh, no. -Sort of. -Spill! -We're actually leaving. -No, is it the infamous William? Because, oh, girl... Danny! Hey! Uh, this is, um, Maya, my friend. -Oh, nice. Nice to meet you. -Hi, Danny. I will take the upgrade to friend, but, no, I actually work with Connie. Oh, right on. So, how much for both of you? - Ah. - I'm sorry? Um, you know my friend Alison? You mean, the Alison I hired Alison? Right. No. Different Alison. Not work Alison. Well, this is her little brother. Uh, we are going to her birthday dinner and we just stopped by for a quick cocktail, but we just got carried away. Okay. Well, have a good time. There's no, like, group discount or something? You're hot. Sorry. He's just had one shot too many. We're gonna be late! Wait, what is this, some kind of roleplay or something? I mean, I'm down. But what's my character? Christine, you ready for the big run? Christine? Christine? Hey, it's Christine, text me or leave me a message! Peace! - Hello? - Debra. Hey, how are you? -Connie! Fine. And yourself? -I'm good. Um, hey, I know the girls are probably having a blast, but we have a big run to get to this morning. Were you still able to drop her off or should I come get her? She's just not answering her phone. Uh. Connie, I dropped Christine off late last night. She had a stomach ache and wanted to go home. Excuse me? Yeah, around 8:30 or so. I thought you were there. Uh, what? No, I wasn't here at that time. And she's not here now. I'm sure she's fine. Don't worry. I'm telling you, this is not like her. I've called her friends, their parents, her school, and no one has seen or heard from her at all. She wouldn't just disappear without a trace like this. How have things been between you two? - Good. Fine. - Have you been fighting? Was she grounded recently or anything? No, nothing like that and... In fact, she was excited for our big beach run today. We've been training for weeks. Is she known to be rebellious? Are you implying that she ran away? I have to cover all my bases. -She wouldn't do that! -I have to agree with Connie. It's-it's really not like Christine. Terri tells me you have a restraining order on the father. D'you know if she's been in contact with him at all? No. Oh, my god... -Do you think... -Let's not jump to conclusions. What other conclusion is there? I told you he was here. He's violent and abusive, and we have to find them! Sit down, miss. We're doing everything we can. Sit down. - You need to listen to him. - Look. I know you're upset and worried. I would be, too. But I've been doing this job long enough to know that if she was brought to the house, it's highly unlikely that she would just vanish without putting up some sort of a struggle or making a peep. My gut tells me she went with somebody willingly. -Because she knew them. -No. She would never go anywhere with him. Maybe she wants a relationship with her father. -And doesn't wanna upset you. -She doesn't. And even if she did, she'd lie and say she was with friends or something. But she would never turn off her phone. Could be the dad's influence. Could be that he took her and he's keeping her against her will. According to the authorities including your sister, we don't yet have proof that he's actually here or has... He was here, Terri! You know it! You said you believed me! We don't have proof yet. There were no inbound flights with his name within the past month. Then he's been here longer looking for us, I'm sure! -Where were you last night? -I was here. I thought you said you weren't at the house when she was dropped off. I wasn't. I just had to run out for a quick errand. What errand? I just had to get something from the grocery store. -Lady items. -Hm. It's gonna be okay. She's a teenager, you've been stretched really thin lately. Maybe she's just doing it for attention. She's not. I know he took her. He wouldn't hurt her. I hope you're right, because this is all my fault. -What are you doing? -Looking for something... That might help us. "Happy birthday, sweetheart. Can't wait to celebrate your big day. We'll be together again. -Love, dad." -When's it from? It doesn't have an age. It's worth holding on to. Hello? -Hello? -Who is it? Hello? Sweetie, is that you? If it's you, just let me know. I promise I won't be mad. -There's no one there. -That's strange. We're sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed. Please check the number... He's taunting me. - What's this? - It's nothing. -It doesn't look like nothing. -It's a gift from William. -Wow! -It's not a big deal. -He's just a generous man. -I'll say. We have more important things to worry about. We don't know where Christine is! You're so quick to assume it's Jason. Do you think William could be behind it? You said yourself you tried to break it off with him. But what if he isn't taking no for an answer? What about the rebound bartender? -He would never. -What about Danny? How do you know that name? I worry about you, Connie. Clearly, for good reason. So are you gonna tell me where you were last night? Or are you gonna try and tell me that you were at the grocery store, too? -I can't. -Why not? Do you have any idea how this looks? How what looks? How this looks. Terri... Do you wanna tell me what's really going on here? Is this everyone? They don't know anything about me ever. I'm very careful. How careful can you really be? You don't know anything about these men. They could be obsessive, they could be crazy. They could have followed you home at night. -I make sure they don't. -How can you be sure? Did you ever stop and think about what could happen to you? -To Christine? -You're not helping, Terri. I'm sorry, look, i-I'm just, it's not like you to be this irresponsible. It's a really big list of suspects. I wish you would have told me if you needed money. I could have helped you. I hate that you had to put yourself in danger. I know, okay? This was my choice. It was my bad decision that got us into this place and I felt it was my responsibility to get us out. I should go back to the station. -Terri, are we... -We're okay. It's just I... I gotta go. Call me the minute you hear from Christine. We're gonna find her and we're gonna get through this together. I promise you. I gotta go. Bye. Call us if you need anything. It's gonna be okay. Thanks, Sheri. Um... Yeah. I hope you're right. If you hear anything from kehau at all, please just let me know. - Will do. - Thanks. -Bye. -Bye. This isn't funny! Hello? Who's there? Veronica. Veronica? What a pleasant surprise! -How are you? -Stop! Don't come any closer. Okay, is this a, uh, a cool new game we're gonna play? I'm serious. What's wrong with you? Is that a taser? -Yeah, I can get into this. -This isn't a joke. I said don't come any closer! All right. All right. Just put that away, please. Not until you sit down. Sure. Whatever makes you comfortable. But, Veronica, this is very confusing to me. -Stop coming by my house. -What? Please, don't play dumb, William. There's no playing involved. Stop with the incessant texting, the blocked calls, the digging into my personal life, the visits, just stop it all! I don't know what you are talking about. -What calls? What visits? -You came by earlier. -Where? -William! No, I'm not trying to upset you, but I don't know what you're talking about. The flowers? The card to v? I'm sorry to say, Veronica, those didn't come from me. Sounds like I have some competition for your affection. -Stop playing around. -I'm not playing around. Why do you think I would lie to you? -I love you, Veronica. -You don't! You don't even know me. Because you won't let me get to know you. It's not gonna happen, William. I don't have real feelings for you. I can't. Well, be that as it may, I didn't try to follow you this afternoon. I didn't leave anything on your doorsteps. I don't even know where your doorsteps are. Y-You've only ever come here, Veronica. And I have been in this house for almost 24 hours. I have a major deadline tying me down. Uh, check the security cameras. Wow. I'm sorry, I... I-I don't know what I'm even... Hey, hey, it's okay. Look, why don't you stay? Let me make you a cocktail. If you need to talk, I'll simply listen. I have to go. If you have a stalker, I can help. That's okay. Seriously? Forget something? Thanks. Have a good night. Hey. If you change your mind, give me a call, okay? -There you go. -You didn't have to do this. Of course I did. You can't be here all alone while Terri is stuck at the precinct. I-I'm not even hungry, though. My stomach's in, like, one giant knot. You have to eat something. I can't even imagine what you must be going through. I'm here for you. Sisters forever. Thanks. Besides, I have a good feeling she's gonna be found just fine. I'd give anything for that. You know, my cousin went through a similar thing. The dad kidnapped the toddler from daycare. The police found them in a cheap motel. But the baby was fine, she was playing with a toy he'd stolen from somewhere. She was oblivious to the whole thing. How long did it take them to find her? I think they found her within 72 hours if I can remember correctly. But that was years ago. And, honestly, she's a well-adjusted kid now. Right. That gives me hope. She'll be fine. We finally found your ex-husband, and they confirmed he's on the island. So now you're starting to believe me? Seems like he indeed did fly into hnl. We got a lead that he might be renting a place in Waimanolo. Still looking for an address on that. Strange thing is, though, we got an alert he checked into the hale hotel today. -That's right by our work. -But we sent a unit over there. And he isn't anywhere on the premises. No Christine either. We're trying to put a trace on the cell phone, but it appears to be off as well. So that's it? That's all you can do right now? Until we physically locate him, yes. We also talked extensively to Debra, Annie, and the rest of the suspects on Terri's list, and we can rule them out as being suspects. How are things going here? I got a few blocked calls last night. -I think it was him. -What did he say? Nothing. I can only hear breathing. Okay, we'll put a tap on the line and see if we can confirm who made those calls. Thank you so much for letting me stop by. No, no, no. No. I mean, thank you. I'll be in touch. I'm going to the hotel. Didn't the detective just tell you to stay put? I don't care. Christine's out there, I can't just sit around. They don't know Jason like I do. Then I'm coming, too. Leo, I need your help. I had a lovely chat with the state police because of you. -Who's this? -She's helping me out. We're trying to find Christine. Look, I already told the cops, I don't know anything about her. But do you know anything about a Jason Andersen staying here? I do not. But I heard Sarah in housekeeping say that someone trashed one of the rooms pretty bad. A room that was a favorite of yours. The front desk got a call from the room requesting housekeeping, but no one was here when I got here. Just this mess. It was worse than this. What else did you clean up? Just more trash. Oh, there was also this. I was gonna give it to my boss. It's an address. Let's go. You've reached Terri Ross with special investigations. Please leave me a message and I will call you back. Thank you. Terri, hey, I don't have time to explain, but I have the address where Jason took Christine. I just texted it to you, but Alison and I are heading there now. This is the address. I think we should get out here. I don't see any cars. Maybe no one's home. -Let's find out. -Okay. It's locked. Wait, where are you going? I'm looking for another way in. Well, maybe we should wait for Terri to get here. Christine can be inside. -I'm gonna try the back. -Oh, okay. Always unlocked. Why don't you go back and wait by the car? -No. You're not going in alone. -Please. I'm coming with you. Let's go. Don't touch anything. Too late. I think I found something. No, just junk. Looks like he hasn't changed much. Christine? Christine? Alison, I hear a car. I think someone's coming. -Let's go. -We haven't checked the... Get back. It's him. Let's go. What are you doing? -Wait in the car. -What? -How'd you find me? -Where's Christine? -What are you talking about? -Stop messing with me, Jason. -Where is she? -How would I know? This isn't funny! What you're doing is illegal! What else was I supposed to do, Connie? You took everything away from me when you came here. I-I thought that maybe... If I followed you, you'd see that I really do wanna make things work. -Where is she? -Shouldn't you know? You're the one with full custody. You followed her home. You tricked her. I haven't seen her since you took her from me. The police are actively looking for her. You're not gonna get away with this. Looking for her? You lost our daughter? You took her! I got your note you left at the hotel. Your threats don't mean anything to me anymore, Jason. -What note? -Tell me where she is. Is this some kind of joke? The only joke around here is you! -What kind of mother are you? -Stop! Don't touch me! I'll kill you if something happened to my baby! You took her from me and then you let this happen? Get off! You don't deserve her! Police! Hands up! Okay... That's impossible. We did a full sweep of the place and there's no sign she's been here recently. Well, maybe he's keeping her somewhere else! He says he knows nothing about her disappearance. We're taking him to the station for questioning to determine whether that's true or not. -It can't be! -Time will tell. We don't have time. What were you even thinking, coming up here on your own? I called you! And it's a good thing we got the message in time. You could have been seriously hurt. The only thing I care about is finding Christine! I promise, we're doing everything we can. Have you lost your mind? You're not finding her fast enough. So you decided to take matters into your own hands? You realize you could have ended up dead. I don't care, Christine is still missing and we have no idea where she is! If Jason didn't take her, then who did? I don't know, Connie! Maybe she got involved with some older boy. You've been working full-time. Actually, double-time. And it's quite possible that you missed a few things. -No. That's ridiculous! -You lead a double life. Maybe she does, too. I thought you were here to support me. I am. I have been. Who do you think looked into your client list as suspects? Who do you think asked their partner to keep it under wraps so that you don't get arrested for solicitation? I'm sorry. I just... I know this is all my fault, and I don't know what to do. I just need her back. I do, too. Okay? I just need her back. Okay, here's what I want you to do. I want you to call to Mark. I want prices from Mexico. I'll meet you back at the office. -Veronica. -You are following me. -I knew it. -Hey, calm down. I'm not following you. I'm just here to run. I downloaded a dating app last night and I figured it was time maybe I get in a little better shape. Right. Although, if I'm being honest, I would love to see you again. Come on, what will it take? I'll pay you triple. -Just give me a Cha... -William, enough. I'm not Veronica. Stop calling me that. -Okay. -I'm Connie. And I'm a mess. My 13-year-old daughter who means the world to me is missing. She vanished into thin air. Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. I-I... I have a ex-husband who's stalking me, and I don't know where she is. And, honestly, it's all my fault because I was too busy protecting my secret life that I failed to protect what it was all for anyway. She's the only thing that matters. And I'm sorry that I don't have time for you right now, but my real life is crashing down all around me. Veronic... Connie, I am so sorry, I had no idea that you were going through all that. I can't imagine, okay? Are the police involved? They're doing what they can. Come here. Come here. I will do anything you need. Do you understand me? Anything I can to help. -I propose an idea. -What? -One more date. -William... Hey, hear me out. Hear me out. I know people, people who will find your daughter. People who would do whatever it takes. That would be wonderful. You come to my place tonight for dinner. All right? No expectations. Just your company. We'll talk details and I'll make the appropriate calls. -Thank you. -Seven o'clock work? Hey. It's nice to meet you, Connie. I'll see you tonight. Look at you. Good evening. You are simply to die for. So, about those friends of yours that... Yes, we're gonna hear from them soon enough, but, uh, first wine. I have been decanting the perfect red. I'm so happy you agreed to see me again. Mm-hmm. I probably shouldn't tell you this, but... I was utterly devastated when you wouldn't return my messages. You broke my little heart into a million pieces. I'm sorry. I've been a little preoccupied lately. Now, about those friends of yours that can help me find Christine... I think the less you know about them, the better. Trust me. Of everything I gave up for Lissie, I am realizing I may have missed good wine the most. Drop the act. -I'm sorry? -Where is she? That's what I'm trying to help you find out. William, her things are in your house. Okay, that's ludicrous. I... What have you done with my daughter? -What is that? -How did you get this? I've never seen that before in my life. -Don't lie to me! -I'm not... Come on... William? No. William, no. Where is Christine? No. What have you done? Alison, what are you... What are you... He was six years sober. He never drank. He wasn't supposed to have the wine, you were. William's my husband. You said your husband was dead. He is now. He said his wife's name was Lissie. That's what he called me. Lissie, short for Alison. -Alison, I did not know. -Yeah. Well, maybe you would have if you cared about anyone other than yourself! -Alison, I do care about you. -Oh. You do? Well, that's funny, because you never once asked how my husband died or even what his name was. What do you want from me? You destroyed my family. It's only fair I returned the favor. By poisoning him? The poison was for you! You know, at first, I just wanted to learn about the whore who ruined my life. So you can imagine my surprise when it was actually my old friend. Sisters forever. Alison, I didn't know. I wanted to destroy you. And then when Jason showed up at the yacht club, I thought he might be the perfect way. So I led you right to him when I left you that little surprise at the hotel. That was you? Like I said, sometimes life has other plans. And how do you think this is, Alison? You'll end up in jail. Uh, no, I won't. See, it was William. He fell in love with a call girl. But she didn't feel the same, so he went crazy. Kidnapped her daughter, trashed their hotel room and led her back to his house where he killed them both. And then he poisoned himself so that they could all be together in the afterlife. Alison, where is my daughter? I always wanted a daughter. It's a shame yours has to die. Where's Christine? Hm, I wish I could remember. Christine! Christine! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom... Mom... Oh, mom. -Oh, no, you don't. -Run, run! -Ah! -Run! Go! You took everything from me. Ah! It doesn't have to be like this! You've given me no choice. - Drop your weapons! - Officer! Officer! Oh! Thank goodness you're here. She broke into my house. She, she tried to kill me. She killed my husband. She's... What are you doing? It's her! Mom! Christine! -New personal record. -Yes! Hey, Veronica, it's Danny. I'd really love to see you again. I think you have the wrong number. There's no Veronica here. I don't need her. Let's go. ♪ Oh hey hey hey ♪ ♪ hey you ♪
