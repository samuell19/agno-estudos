'We are all haunted by things other than the dead, 'as Grace MacDonald was haunted by a dream, 'an innocent dream which became a bridge to horror.' Daddy! Daddy! Daddy, help me. Daddy, please help me. Daddy, please help me. Where are you? Please help me, Daddy. Daddy! No, no! Daddy, please help me! Oh, don't let them get me! Daddy! Oh, please save me! Daddy! Daddy! - Help me! Daddy! No! - Come on... You'll wake up all the other children. My daddy's coming to take me out of this place. You have no daddy. I do so, and he's coming. Grace, be quiet. Don't force me to have to strap you to the bed. Daddy, help me! Help me! Help me, Daddy, please! Please, Daddy, help me! Where are you? Daddy! Right, all of you, back down in your beds. And get your heads covered. I want all of your heads covered. Alright, young lady. Now, back to your bedroom. Come on, march. Our cheeks to our pillows, girls. With a night's rest, our day will be shining. Cheek on the pillow. My daddy will come. No, Grace, he will not. Daddy? What is this sweet child's name? Grace MacDonald. Grace MacDonald? Take one step forward. Alright. Now, the rest of you, right turn. Now, back to your classrooms. 'From year to year and town to town 'Grace stayed on with her adopted church 'to continue searching for her father. 'She became engaged to young Patrick Bundy 'who gave up the ministry to study medicine. 'Now only his older brother, Jessie, remained, 'turning a once respected church into a carnival.' Jessie? I just can't put this on. - Well, why not, Grace? - It's just not right. Suppose my father should be out there? Your pappy's dead just like mine. Did you put that make-up on your legs and back? - Yes. - This is full dress, Grace. It's got to be just like it is in front of the people. Now, you come on and get into that costume. But two different truck drivers said that they knew my father, that he's alive and lives somewhere around here. I'm gonna go look for him this evening. Well, they're just mistaken, Grace. The orphanage my pappy picked you out of has no records of any mother or father. Now, you just come on and get into that thing. Are you sure nobody's out there? At six o'clock in the morning, Grace? Now, you come on. You only look at me when you have to, Jessie Bundy. Damn it, Grace! You're gonna be my sister-in-law soon as you marry Patrick. Now, I think of you like family, covered round or naked out. I got that platform up a full 30 feet this time. We got this far by hard work. You're gonna bring 'em in, Grace MacDonald, and I'm gonna save their souls and cure their ills, just like my pappy. Better than my pappy even. No time for scallywagging. Good Jesus! Will you look at that? You're queen of this here desert, Grace. And of everything that ever lays eyes on you. Patrick's a very lucky man, Pa. Now, it's 30 feet, Grace. You did it three times from 25 with no trouble. Keep your confidence and take that deep breath like I taught you. You can do it easy, Grace, as you're an angel in the service of the Lord. Now, you go on my cue: "the fires of hell". Here it comes, Angel Grace. For they shall fall into the fires of hell. Shirley? Shirley, you up yet? Shirley! Exams today. Don't oversleep. Shirley? Shirley! Mrs. Jordan? - Mrs. Jordan? - What is it? Shirley doesn't answer me. She was probably up all night studying. She's gonna sleep right through her final exams. I'm gonna have a heart attack going up and down these stairs. I'm gonna choke to death while you all stand around watching. It's an emergency. I almost bled to death once with an emergency. - I'm sorry, Mrs. Jordan. - The medical profession is a disgrace. Look at this filthy place. It's harder for Shirley. - She's a slow reader. - Ah. Shirley! It's time to get up. Shirley? Shirley, this is Patrick and we both have an exam in less than one hour. Come on. That's it. Okay, now, I'm gonna get the shower ready for you. A hell of a doctor you are, turning your back on a naked female. - You have a point there. - Just promise me one thing. That you won't leave patients in the outer office, waiting, when they're in pain and bleeding. I won't, Mrs. Jordan. Hard wooden bench it was. Like you'd expect to find in church. And the nurse keeps telling me I'll be alright till the doctor comes. The blood's pouring out of my foot, and she's sitting there smiling and saying I'll be alright till the doctor comes. - She's stopped brushing. - Nurses are very dumb. She's stopped brushing and I didn't hear her step into that shower. Come on, girl. Come on. - But I was up all night. - You gotta take a test. Take your hands off me. I'll get black and blue. Alright, a cold shower will do it if nothing else. Oh! Turn it off! - Turn it off! - Now you're awake. Oh, I'll call the police! You get out of here or I'll call the police! - Do you promise to stay wide awake? - Oh, no more, please. - Do you? - Yes. Are you gonna get dressed and go down and take your exam? And you're gonna pass and be a good lady doctor? - Yes. - Alright, then. And take good care of the sick. If you don't stop that crying, I'll turn the shower back on. Now, you hurry and get dressed. She's really a good girl. You're good, too, to be so concerned about her. Thank you, Mrs. Jordan. How come you two have never...? Well, you know the others are always lying to me about helping each other study till three or four in the morning? And I'm the idiot landlady who believes them. But you two, nothing. Hm? Never. Well, I've got a girl, Mrs. Jordan. Oh. I never see her. You never mention her. Well, she, uh... She does church work. Church work? - You mean, like bingo? - No, no, not like bingo. What, then? Well, she, um... Are you running around with a nun? No, no, but something like that. - A nun? - Well, she travels, preaching the Bible. Oh, oh, oh. - A faith healer. - Yes. Well, she's raking in the money. And she's gonna marry a doctor to boot. She's no fool. I'll be dressed and ready to go in five minutes, Patrick. I'm deeply indebted to you both. 'She's really a good girl. 'You're good, too, to be so concerned about her. 'She's very nice looking when she ain't with the books. 'Why don't you take her out to dinner tonight, just once?' 'I'm driving out to the desert tonight to see Grace. 'I haven't seen her in nearly six months.' 'The divine healing services of Reverend Jessie Bundy 'will commence in 30 minutes. 'Cars and buses, please take your parking instructions from the deputy. 'Now, if we will all follow Mr. Ronnie on the piano, 'the Holy Spirit will cure us.' 'The visit of Patrick was an intrusion on Grace's dream. 'Finding her father was more important than loving or living. 'She could stall no longer. 'The dream had to be given life, 'here, tonight.' It all comes back. I've dreamt so many times of us sitting like this. For hours. I love you. And I love you. Beautiful Patrick Bundy. We're going along on that holiday together. And we'll make love in a big, warm bed. I'm still a virgin for you, Patrick. You didn't have to say that. I know. But I am. And you like that better, don't you? I don't think about it. But isn't it better that way? A little? Yes. Is Shirley a virgin too? How would I know? All those nights reading medical journals until the sun comes up. Now, you can't tell me, Patrick, that two people of the opposite sex, so intimate for so long, have not made love. Have you and I made love? - But we're different. - How? Well... It's more beautiful between us. I mean, I can understand weakness of the flesh, with Shirley or with anyone. I just don't wanna hear about it. From all your letters, it seems like she's fixing stew meat or hamburgers every other night of the week. That's about it. Well, then, there is something going on. Am I right? I thought you didn't wanna hear about it. Jessie will be preaching soon. - You should listen to how good he is. - I will. Now, I've gotta go get dressed. Well, I'll see you around for the services. There's something I have to tend to later. I'll help you. No, I've gotta do it alone. Look, I can only tell you that it involves my father. Have you contacted him? I'll know more later. Now, you may escort me to my dressing trailer. I'm sorry, my brothers and my sisters. I can't do anything for your aches or your miseries. And God, God cannot help your aches or your miseries. I am powerless, and God... God, he's powerless too. And I'll tell you why. Because God gave that power to you. He took the almighty power to heal and through my body and my bones and my heart and my voice, he's passing it onto you. Praise be to God. He said... "Gather close, "my beloved creatures, "because I'm giving it to you." God is giving it to you. God is giving it to you! Good. Good enough to straighten out that twisted spine or limb that ain't working right. He says, "Put that limb to use." God don't want you sick, he wants you whole and well. You got a cancer in there? He says, "Reach in, pull it out." And if you can't reach in, then take my hand and I'll reach in for you. Let God reach through you, through me, back to you. I mean cancer! Yes! The incurable kind, yes. You are so beautiful, Grace. You! You! You! All of you! Why must you dive from so high? There's no danger. I'm confident in myself now. And I'm confident in you. I know we will marry, and there'll be children that are loved. And I'll leave Jessie's work and join you in yours. Grace... I don't wanna just kiss you anymore. There'll be time enough for the other. I'm not gonna walk away half bent over from that pain anymore. I mean it, Grace. - Soon it's my cue to enter. - Later, then. No, not tonight. Please, not tonight. I have got exams all next week. I can't come back. Look, I'll call you from wherever we are. We'll make plans. But I've gotta go now. I've gotta make my entrance from the other door. Grace, please! Sister Grace and I will now demonstrate. Watch closely, my brothers and my sisters... There she is, half-naked, just like those who seek to destroy God's power. But they shall not, for they shall fall into the fires of hell. Raise your arms. Raise them, brother. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. You believe too? God's here tonight. I believe in the Spirit. Praise the Lord! Aren't you young Patrick Bundy? - Yes. - I'm Sheriff Pender. Mike Pender. I couldn't breathe on the left side for more than three months. Your daddy prayed for me, pressed his hand right here. I can't explain what came from that man's arm and filled my chest. It was a current, a lullaby, a belief. I wept in his arms, so much that I got him to weeping too. We wept that pain away. A doctor at the County General signed a paper sending me back to full duty. Said there wasn't a thing wrong with me! Hallelujah. Why aren't you up there preaching with your brother Jessie? Well, I've left my father's church. I study medicine now. Oh. I'm sorry. Nothing to be sorry about. That's just the way it goes. Heal Her! Heal Her! You ever need anything, you call me at the Phelan office. Sheriff Mike Pender. Okay, thank you. Jesus! Jesus! Jesus... - Heal him, brother. - Heal him. You can do it, I know you can. 'Now Grace felt the almighty power. 'She could turn fantasy into reality. 'Later that night, her search ended in a hotel for retired men. 'The people, the places, the events, all real to Grace, 'but they are in fact the beginnings of her imaginary world.' Excuse me, sir. I'm looking for my father, Timothy MacDonald. Do you know him? Maybe one of them knows him. Sir? I'm looking for my father, Timothy MacDonald. I think he used to be a truck driver at one time. I like that. Oh, that's a good one. Hello, honey. Hello, cutie. Come on, sugar. Wake up. Wake up, lovey. That's it, beauty. That's a nice boy. Hey... Hey, who are you? Get out. Hey, Dan, I thought we had a deal: no independents. Now, wait. Wait a minute. What's the matter? Are you lost? Down on your luck? Huh? Let's go. Let's have a bally-wally. - Come on. - Hey... Mama's gonna take you to your playpen. How'd you like to work in a whorehouse, huh? I got some nice clean rooms. Sir, your talk frightens me. They come from three states to work in my house. Shut up, you old goat! You know... I got no old goats in that house, only young, beautiful girls like you. Satin dresses, red and blue and gold. Every meal served with silver and champagne. And music, with colored maids to look after you. I don't think you understand. I work for a preacher. Ah. Wait a minute... Are you the girl that's gonna dive from that tower? - Yes. - You couldn't be. Oh, no... You wouldn't be Tim MacDonald's daughter Grace? Yes. Do you know my father? Forgive me. Come up here and smash this dirty... I told you to shut up. I'm talking to a young lady here. Won't you tell me about my father? I'm sorry but your father's dead. He died yesterday. I got him at my place. See, officially I'm an undertaker. But I'll take care of him good. No charge. He was a friend. Don't be frightened. This is the preparation room. Come on in and see your father. Come on. Just a dead old man. He's your father. I'll leave you here with him a few minutes. Oh, my office is down the hall to the right. You can come there and sign the papers. Oh, Daddy. Why did you die? Please! Please come! Come see him! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Now rest. Rest a while. He's alive. I assure you that's not so. - Now, rest. Rest. - He's sitting up. I swear by God he was sitting up. My father's alive! Alright, alright. We'll both go take a look. Are you alright? Yes. Look, shouldn't we call a hospital or something? - Maybe they can help. - Believe me, that's the first thing we'll do. Let's... Let's go take a look. Come on. He was sitting up. Here. The doctor pronounced him dead, not I. But I always make double sure. Grace, there are no signs of life. Call the doctor again. Please don't do anything to him. - I'll have to embalm him. - No, don't touch him. He sat up. He wants me to help him. The bereaved always imagine life in the remains. They swear the chest expands with breath. Some even hear them speak. Please don't touch him. If I wait any longer, embalming will be impossible. The blood hardens. You see, I have to do... I have to do what I have to do. It's in vain. This has to be done. It has to. Yes, of course. If you want to cry, darling, it's good for you to cry. I have to do what I have to do. It's really necessary. I know, I know. Yes, I know, I know. Everybody feels the same way but... But you had to do what you did, Daddy. Now they'll... take you away. We'll be separated again. I know, Daddy, I'll hide you. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. This way. Now, come on, Daddy. There's Papa riding Sultan. That medicine fella, Patrick, - is he coming? - He can't get free from the hospital. - He's the one I like. - Pa! Oh, Preacher Jessie will just have to get used to me speaking my mind. - No offense, Jessie. - Not at all, sir. After all, it was you and your father and your brothers that took Grace in and it was you that brought her to me and I'm indebted to you. We're happy to have done it, sir. For a preacher you talk in awful short phrases. - Do I? - What are you so nervous about? Papa, you're overpowering him. Be hospitable and gay. I am not overpowering him. You are. Reverend Jessie Bundy is a guest in my house and he is welcome here. I am Timothy MacDonald. I am the host and I am hospitable and gay. - You are not. - Oh, I'm not, am I? - No, you're not. - Alright. Fetch me my tobacco and my pipe. And a match. Sit down, Reverend. Sit down. Now, fetch the Irish whiskey. Two tall glasses for the men and a noggin for yourself. Oh, um... Do you take water with your whiskey, Reverend? Uh, no. No, sir. Oh. Say, now bring me my squeezebox. Do you jig, Reverend? - What? - Irish dancing, can you do it? No. No, sir. Oh. This is a combination of "Stack of Barley" and "Highland Fling". Open the gate, Grace. It must be a hundred times a day I wish there were no Patrick at all. I wish I could say I loved you, Grace. And I wish I could want to rip out the eyes of everyone staring at you. But I enjoy dangling you in front of them. I know how they must be aching. But they ain't gonna get any. I should have shame for the way you make me feel. But I don't. You pigs! Damn pigs! No, Daddy! No! No, Daddy! No, Daddy, please! No! No. No, Daddy! You whore! It's all your fault. You slut! You're causing all this trouble. Daddy? Daddy? Daddy! Sultan? Jessie. Oh, Jessie. Grace? Baby Grace, where are you? Baby Grace, can you hear me at all? Oh, Grace, come and see how I fixed the front gate. Before I was lying in my bed, crying from the pain from where you struck me. All of a sudden there was this cold wind. And the room all around me was... It was dirty. The walls weren't fresh painted like they are now. The floors were barren and splintered from neglect. Another bad dream, Grace. It's that devil's church you belong to. They're a bad lot and you ought to keep away from them. - It's not a devil's church. - It is. It's you, you're the devil. I'm going back to work on that gate. When you've got a civil tongue in your head, I'll hear your apology. I ran to the barn, thinking you'd be tending to Sultan. There was no Sultan. The stall was broken and... the hinges were sticking out from decayed wood. There were holes in the barn roof. And the small pile of straw in the corner... ...was soaked through with blood. My hand was made wet as I brushed it aside. And there was the body of Reverend Bundy. Right where I put him, and I'd kill him again, or anyone else that tried to do harm to my baby Grace. I ran to the house looking for you. I told you, I was down by the gate all morning. Your room was empty. The smell of your pipe tobacco was gone. Oh, I'd like to get my hands on those damn preachers. And those phonies you have throwing themselves in the aisles, squealing and fainting like they had the epilepsy. There's no fresh paint. And the curtains are gone. You're gone too. The body of Reverend Bundy... There sure enough. So I ask myself, who is it that killed him and covered him with straw? I killed him, I tell you. I killed him. I killed him, Daddy. Because I'm thinking that you're not even here at all. Oh, my sweet daughter, Grace. Here, join hands with me. See if it isn't life and warmth you feel. I'm flesh and I'm blood. And I will not abandon you. - It's no trick, then? - No trick, my sweet Grace. Oh, Daddy, I want us to love each other. We do. I wanna hold you. Then do. Isn't that better? The walls are painted. The curtains are blowing in the cool afternoon breeze. And Sultan is down in the stall, kicking up his anger because I'm late in feeding him. We'll have to clean out that barn, make things just like they were. Oh, we will. When I bring Patrick home you'll be nice to him, won't you? Surely I'll be nice to him. I can smell the tobacco from your shirt now. I'm not afraid anymore, Daddy. Bring your Patrick home. I've invited him this weekend. It's about time I met him. Mm, you will, Daddy. 'Grace's own phantom father image 'convinced her that fantasy is reality.' 'She moved Jessie's body to a county disposal site, 'believing she was covering up for her father's crime.' 'Now she must get on with her next order of business. 'As she brought Jessie home to meet her father, 'she will bring home Patrick.' I'll get the shears. Shirley, your duck is bleeding very badly. Oh, damn it. We could go out and get something. First let me finish this. Take your time. You're always very comforting, Patrick. I don't ever want us to move from this apartment house. I wanna keep coming downstairs. I wanna keep making love to you. I won't move. - You are just... - You don't have to say anything. Six years. I'm gonna see Grace. - And I'm gonna tell her... - You don't have to do anything. I'm just gonna see her. And I'm gonna tell her that I believe that... ...that something happened very quickly to me... ...that made me grow up. Could you have Dr. Patrick Bundy paged for me, please? Are you a patient of Dr. Bundy's? I mean, we just don't page people. Oh, I can imagine how that could get. No, I'm Grace MacDonald. Dr. Bundy and I are going to be married. Today? Oh, heavens, no! But soon. I'm Grace MacDonald. He'll ring the house phone in the waiting section. 'Dr. Bundy, Dr. Bundy to the emergency entrance immediately. Grace! Um, look, I can't just now. Some other time. Is this Shirley who you went to school with? Yes. Let's go. Let's go. Come on! I found my father. - He's alive. - That's wonderful. I can't talk now. I just can't. No face left at all, Sheriff. Nothing in the pockets, no laundry marks. Sure got some fancy clothes on, though. You got any ideas? I've learned to keep my ideas to myself. Yes, sir. Hello, this is Dr. Bundy. This is Sheriff Mike Pender from Phelan. Yes, Sheriff Pender, what can I do for you? Well, I'd like to speak to your brother Jessie but I don't know where he's preaching. It just so happens he isn't preaching at all right now. Uh, he and Grace have taken a couple weeks' vacation. They're visiting with her father at this small farm she's leased. Where's the farm at? It's not too far from you, actually. Uh, right near the intersection of Star Route 2 and State 138. Yeah, I know that. That's the old Demile place. But it's vacant, been boarded up for six months. Yeah, well, that's it. I need to take a drive out there myself if I can get away from here. Could you give me the phone number? There is no phone. Says her father doesn't believe in them. Oh? She says he lived in that hotel in Phelan for the last 20 years without a phone, he doesn't need one now. - What hotel is that? - Well, you must know. It's the only place in town I guess. Uh, Grace remembers that it was right next to the barbershop. Oh, thank you. Thank you, Patrick. You've been a big help to me. I hope you can get away for that day or two. Goodbye. 'What hotel is that?' 'Well, you must know. It's the only place in town I guess.' 'Uh, Grace remembers that it was right next to the barbershop.' Grace MacDonald? Reverend Jessie Bundy? Is anyone here? Grace MacDonald? Reverend Jessie Bundy? Is anyone here? Reverend Jessie Bundy? Thank you, sir. But can you really be sure, Grace, darling? I'm sure. But from all the things you told me, he seemed like such a dependable fella. He's dependable alright, Daddy. He just doesn't love me anymore. He loves her. I'll never love anyone except Patrick. Oh, but of course you will. They'll be lined along the roads waiting for you. But Patrick will be with her. You'll fill yourself with hatred, Grace. I know. - And there's no stopping it. - Oh, yes, there is stopping it. - What are you gonna do? - He's broken your heart, hasn't he? Hasn't he? No, Daddy, please! I'll hear no more about it. You want me to take care of you, don't you? Don't you? - Don't you? - Yes. Well, then, I'll take care of it in my own way. Grace? - He's come to say goodbye to me. - Grace? She's come along to make it easier for him. Well, you can't be sure of that exactly. I'll tell you what, you ask him straight out, no bones about it. And if what you say is true, you turn your back and walk from him. I'll be watching. Grace? Grace, are you alright? Shirley and I saw the windows boarded up and we thought that maybe we weren't at the right place. We're only gonna stay a short while. There are some things I couldn't say in my letters. Grace? Grace! Please listen to me. Grace, where are you going? Grace, what's happening here? Sheriff Pender. Grace. What's happened here? What is it? Grace! Oh, Grace! Let's get out of here! She's gone crazy. The keys! Roll up the windows. All of them, quick! She's running around to your side. Keep down, away from the glass. Grace! Stop it, for God's sake! Stop it! No! No! No! Please! Stop! Hurry, my black bag. No! The pentothal. Grace... No... They're bringing her out now. She's still a bit woozy but... she'll be alright. Well, what else, John? Patrick, if there's one thing I've learned in my 20 years of psychiatry, that is never to second-guess. She has projected herself into a father image. All of her life, from what I can tell. Now, a chronic psychosis is very difficult to dislodge. She very well may wanna remain in her fantasy world. - Not Grace MacDonald. - And why not? Look at the drab world she has to accept now. Look at what she has to give up. I'm deeply sorry about your brother Jessie. And Sheriff Pender. And the undertaker from Phelan. Father will just have to pay for those horrible things he's done. Would you mind looking after Sultan for me, please? We'll take very good care of Sultan. Thank you. Excuse me. What undertaker? Her fantasies include a hotel for old men, a sort of a combination of whorehouse and undertaking parlor in Phelan. Now, she believes that she brought her father back from the dead. Then he had to murder the undertaker to keep from being embalmed and buried. Now, the deputies have found no hotel, no whorehouse, no undertaker. But if another body should turn up somewhere, I wouldn't be a bit surprised. She went through all the motions. She killed him. But to her, it was her father doing the killing to protect her. 'From the dust and rotting timbers of the abandoned farm, 'Grace gave life to her dream, 'and Sultan, the ghost of some wild part of herself, 'would wait until she and her father returned. 'Never again will there be an unloving world for Grace MacDonald.' 'The walls are painted. 'The curtains are blowing in the cool afternoon breeze. 'And Sultan is down in the stall, 'kicking up his anger because I'm late in feeding him.' 'I'm not afraid anymore, Daddy.'
