Pete are you off? Oh yeah, I'll be right there. Well, here we go. You really are disappointed they didn't get up, aren't you? No, of course not. Why should they get up at six o'clock in the morning just to see me run? Big day. Are you nervous? Yeah, I... No, me nervous, you kidding? Don't start something you can't finish. Yeah, got to get out to the gap. Can I get a rain check? Yeah, you owe me one. Come on, come on, I wanna go over this strategy again. Well, turns out fairly simple. There's no significant grades for the first eight or 10 miles, so you can use it as a warmup. Listen, I've been over all that with Pete and Roger. Ah ha. Dad, do you remember what I told you? What? Bud found this incredible apartment and he wants me to move in with him. And I can swing I, I know I can. Now don't be silly. You've got a good thing going for you here. Now remember, it's important for you to set a pace that's comfortable for you, one that you can keep mile after mile. I figure you should be right here at Turtle Back at lunchtime. Now don't eat too much. You might wanna take a little nap. Dad, I'm 22 years old. Yeah, 22 going on 17. Oh. Besides, we been a team too long. Got you this far, haven't 1? Dad, I can't stay here the rest of my life. Now there's no need to shout. We're both in the same room. You treat me like I'm a little kid. Well, as long as you act like one, I'm gonna treat you like one. Pete, for god's sakes sit down. Every time I turn around I almost run you over. Sorry. Here. - Oh, I'm, I'm really not very hungry. You know, I never thought I'd be so nervous about today. Really? Yeah, you know, all those weeks and months of training and then you're all of a sudden, here we are, oh. Are the boys gonna be there at the finish tomorrow? Hmm, I don't know, why? I don't know, I just, I thought. Yeah, come on, I'll give you a lift over. What made you choose Glory anyway? Oh there's an old mining trail that goes there. Straight across the desert. Nobody's used it since the miners did over 50 years ago. That's a terrific reason, Roger. Anyway, we are the main attraction at the annual pioneer days celebration. It's either that or spend a weekend grading term papers. Well, I can think of something a lot more fun than that. What? - You just blew it sweetheart. If you'd move in with me there wouldn't be any problem. I don't think you're ready for it yet. Will you at least think about it? Why do I think I can do this? You got Roger. He knows the desert like the back of his hand. I don't have nearly enough mileage in. Bullshit. "I have plenty of mileage in, ” he said. Fay? Oh, it's green. Hi. Hi Ruth. Hi Fay. What do you think, great day, huh? A great day for a run. Where the hell's Craig. It's almost 6:30. Yeah, I wonder what his excuse is gonna be this time. Knowing Craig it'll be a good one. I can't believe I'm standing here watching Roger try to push a garbage can. Did you get the t-shirts? Yeah. Pete doesn't suspect a thing. In fact I may have been a bit too casual. I think he's a little hurt. Wait 'til you see his face tomorrow. Oh they're great. The boys are gonna love them. Oh shh shh. Roger, how far are you gonna go today? Well, buried the food and camping equipment about I 50 miles out so I think we better go at least that far. 50 miles. Oph! Well, look who finally got here. Sorry I'm late. Someone must have siphoned my tank so dad had to drive me. Hey, I believe him. But of course, I believed Nixon. I tried to tell him it runs just as well full as it does empty. How you doing, Herb. Sorry to get you out of bed this early on a weekend. Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world. Did you check Ruth out? The body that shook Cleveland. I know, we'll bring her, and we'll leave Roger behind. You are the horniest kid I have ever seen. Anyone that can look at her and not be horny is dead. You didn't forget anything, did you Craig? No, but my dad will be happy to go over the list with you if you want him to. Looks like we're the send-off committee. Yeah, the marching band couldn't make it. Oh, we've been looking forward to this day for a long time. Hey! - Yeah? Listen you guys, you take care of my boy now. Are you kidding, Herb? He'll probably end up taking care of us. Come on guys, it's time. Yeah er, well, you better get going. I don't want the boys to wake up to an empty house. Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah. Roger says we should be there about one, 1:30. Okay. See you then. Okay. Be careful out there. Feel like I'm on Hill Street Blues. Hey, why don't you just drive along beside us. Run fast, do you hear. See you in Glory. I'll be waiting. Pete, haven't you forgotten something? Oh shit. I guess I'd forget my head if it wasn't tied on. Are you ready Pete, are you ready? Yeah, I'm good. - Ready. Okay, this is it guys. Five, four, three, two, one, let's go. Yeah! Go go, yeah, come on, come on. Now listen up guys, we've got a long way to go. How do you feel? - Great. Now that we've started, 711/2 miles and counting doesn't seem all that impossible. Still seems a lot like 72 miles to me. The trick is not to think about the whole distance as once. Just think about getting to first waterhole. How far is that? It's about 12 miles. Okay. Hey Roger, can I ask you something? Sure, go ahead. You know you're always offering to fix me up? Yeah? When you've finished with Ruth, can I have her? Does the term, "Fat chance, sweetheart” mean anything to you? Hey, he's in love. Oh my god, he's in love. All right fellas, this is where we say "Goodbye" to the highway. Something happens when you're out running, you know. No complications. So pure. See those jagged peaks? Those are the El Diablo's. Glory's at the base of them. No matter how much twisting and turning you do, you can always get your bearings by finding those peaks. They're a good guider. Who's chicken? You are. Pete, will you give me a hand with the boys. I've got my hands full. Pete? Why do you always have to run when I need you? Pete? Can't live there for the rest of my life. Well, tell him that. 1 did. It always ends up with him saying, "When you're older, we'll talk about it."” I can just see him, when I'm 35 years old, "Dad". Hey, fellas, don't you think we're pushing the pace a little bit? Ah, geeze, forgot we got this old man with us. I don't know how to break this to you Pete but, we go any slower, we'll be going backwards. Hey Craig, did you see that box? What box? - The box you need to stand on to kiss my ass. Cute, Peter, real cute. Let's hit the trail boys. Fuck! - Come on Pete. Come on! Hold it. Ah ha! Roger, you caught a turtle. Underneath this carapace are two sacks of water, pure enough to drink. This little fella's a walking canteen. How do you get to it? Well, you have to kill it, but I'm not gonna do that. Desert tortoise is an endangered species. That's okay, Roger. I don't think I could drink a turtle anyway. We've been on this dirt road a long time. How far does it go? Almost all the way to Glory. It's the old mining trail. We've already run further than I've ever run before in my life, and we still have 40 miles to go. Just keep putting one foot in front of the other, we'll make it. Can I right that down? Argh! Argh! Oh god, take it easy will you? I've got it. - Just a minute. Hold it right there. What the.. Put your hand on your head and no talking. Wait a minute. - Hands on your head and no talking! Single file. All right move it. Single file now. Hands still up now. - Keep up with him. Line them up over there. Gentlemen, I'm afraid we might owe you an apology. You see, we're on a training mission. Sometimes you have to improvise. So I've been using you as the enemy. We've been tracking you for the last half hour. Come on, let me buy you a beer. That's just him looking at faces, you'll love this. That's not a joke, I'm dying laughing. Yeah, I damn near suffocated. Damn little lizard crawled right across my face. Got dirt up my nose. I thought I was gonna die. Hey, they weren't the only ones. My heart was going a mile a minute. I mean, I still haven't stopped shaking. Oh, I'm Clay Matthews. When I'm not buried up to my ass in sand, I sell insurance. A hell of a sale's pitch you got. Yeah. Colonel thought you guys might like some beer. Hey hey hey, what about our beers. Hey, hey. - You guys can get your own. Well, what are you gentlemen doing out here? I thought we had the desert all to ourselves this weekend. I was about to ask you the same question. We're the citizens brigade out of Denver. We're out here on a survival exercise. Everybody was allowed to bring only the provisions they could fit into their saddle bags, and a knife. Very impressive. Well you sure scared the hell out of us. Well, this is the first time mission for about half these people, but we've got them shaping up pretty good. Self-reliance, that's what it's gonna come to. Just a matter of time, self-reliance. You are joking aren't you? You mark my words, young man, when the crunch comes, and it will come. Well, just look around the world today, any moderately intelligent human being can certainly discern that the crunch is coming. And then only those that are prepared... Oh no. Well the hell you been Stephanie? Yeah, we were depending on you. Yeah, I twisted my ankle. Ah. - Tough shit, you let us down. Hold it, just wait a minute. Get the steel pot. - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah, let's put her on the pot. - Yeah, that's humiliating. Who are the most important people? Members of my platoon. What is the objective of any mission? To protect my people at all costs. What's your pledge to this group? To do or die. What were you supposed to do? Signal as they were starting up the hill. Yeah, but you didn't did you? We were suffocating in the sand. Right. - Because my ankle, I, I thought I broke it. - I don't give a rat's ass. You gotta hop all the way back home on one leg. What if that had been a real enemy? Yeah. - Our lives are on the line. We could've died. - What if they breach the security of the camp? - Look at me when I'm talking to you, you little bitch. Yeah, and whatever made you think you could be a soldier? You got a fat ass. - You better be careful you. Turn around and show us your fat ass. My ankle hurts, it hurt really bad. Ah, what's the matter, Steph, are you having your period? - Are you on your period? Had enough yet? I'm not gonna answer that. You're on the pot. You answer every question put to you. Answer the question, soldier. You heard the colonel. - I heard you slept with a whole football team, didn't you? No, of course not. - How many of them did you sleep with? - I went with... - Oh did you go down on them? What are their names? - Jesus, this is sick. Did they go down on you? - Did you like it? Come on, describe it to us. - No! Went out and liked it. - Too dirty? I can't blame them. - Well, I wouldn't either. The stench of you. - That makes me wanna gag. My ankle hurts. - Get back on that pot. I can't. - Get back on the pot Soldier. Get up there. - Poor Stephanie. Oh look now she's gonna cry. - Oh come on Stephanie, cry for us. - Take a step. I'm sorry. - You're sorry? I'm sorry. - Oh. I'm ashamed I even know you. Ah, maybe mommy will come and take you home if you cry. I'm sorry, please don't. - Call mommy. Please, I don't, I can't I, - Ah, you're sorry. Pull yourself together soldier. You're gonna stand on that pot for another 10 minutes, and no one's gonna talk to you or acknowledge you for the rest of the day. Pete, that girl is hurt. You heard the colonel, stay away from her. Hey, so why don't you just bring on a firing squad? Craig, stay out of this. Our measures may seem harsh to you, young man, but discipline is the heart of a military organization. Oh, and digging into her sex life? Oh that's real military isn't it. I don't remember anybody asking your opinion, smart ass. Why don't you mind your own business. Oh yes sir Mein Capitan. Hold it, Craig, hold it. Wait a minute, wait a minute. We don't want any problems with you guys. Now you're right, this is none of our business. You know, we didn't ask to come here, so whatever you guys wanna do, we'll just be on our way. Yeah well, you better teach your little friend here some manners. Nazi dickhead. - Shh shh. You never did tell us where you're going. Er we're running to er, Pitch Creek. You know where that is? I think I've seen it on my map. They're still our prisoners, dad. I think we've detained these gentlemen long enough. You're free to go, and good luck. Jesus, do you believe those guys. Assholes. Talk about your Looney Tunes. Those guys are really scary. Tell me about it. I didn't think we were gonna get out of there. I was paralyzed. It was like I couldn't move, you know. It was like one of those dreams where you try to move but your body just won't respond. Let's get off the main road. Head to the sand dunes. It'll take us out of our way but at least we'll avoid those guys. Later we can double back, pick up the trail. I hate that. I hate how I feel about myself. I remember one day when I was a little kid. I was walking to school and there was this gang, who was always beating up on us. And they were standing on the corner waiting for me. And I was so scared, I ended up walking two blocks out of my way so I wouldn't have to face them. I hate that. You were just a little kid. Yeah, but today I wasn't a little kid. I love you Roger, I'll love you forever. Wait a minute. Oh shit. Pitch Creek, huh. Looks like you guys are going in the wrong direction. Listen, now we don't want any trouble. What do you want? I want to teach your friend there some manners. Look, we're not doing anything to you guys. Now why don't you just go play soldiers some place else and leave us alone. Play soldier? I'll play soldier with you pop. Ugh, ugh. Argh, argh. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. Argh. Son of a bitch. Argh! Yargh! Are you all right? Roger, Roger, are you all right? Something's the matter. He isn't moving. Move out. Come on Roger, look at me. Talk to me. He's not dead, Pete. Pete, is Roger dead? God damn you! What! What did he! You murderer! Cowards. - He's gone. God damn you. Roger. Roger. It's not fair Pete. He was, he was, what's going on, what's going on? I don't know! Now come on Pete, come on. Hold it together there. Hang on. You can do it. Think Pete, you gotta think. Now what are we gonna do? Oh oh oh. They're gonna come back. Oh sweet Jesus. They're gonna come back. They killed Roger. They're never gonna let us get away. We gotta get out of here. Come on Craig, let's go. No, no, got to stay with Roger. We gotta get out of here. - No! We have to leave him, Craig. Now come on, help me take him over to the sand dune. Come on, come on. Come on. Okay, now we gotta get out of here. We've gotta get help. Where's the map? Okay, El Diablo is here. So that means we've got to be somewhere in this area. There's a highway, five or six miles in that direction. We'll head for that, and flag down a car. Come on Craig, let's go. Come on Craig, let's go. Roger. We're not out here to cover up for you, Sonny. We are a unit. We are in this together. This is supposed to be a military operation. Quiet! Quiet. I would not have chosen for this to happen. It's regrettable that he's dead. We can't change that. Now we have to think rationally. What are the alternatives? We let these men escape, they'll go straight to the authorities. And we'll all be charged with murder. But colonel, we were back in camp. It doesn't matter! We're all in this together. So you see, those two men are a threat to us. They are the enemy. This is a blessing in disguise. This is what we've been training for. And we all knew that sooner or later it had to come to this. That when the crunch came, we'd have to kill or be killed. That's what we've all been preparing ourselves for. All this time we've been playing tactical games with imaginary goals. Now we've got a real objective. Those two men cannot be allowed to escape. Colonel. - I will not tolerate any insubordination. The colonel's right. We're a unit. Yeah, we're in this together. Casey, you take your men. Secure the right flank from here to the highway. Sonny, your group starts on the left. Now we'll cross you every 500 yards, working towards the foothills. Who are the most important people? The members of our platoon. What is the objective of any mission? To protect our people at all costs. What is your duty? - To do or die! Freeze. This is the dumbest stunt you've ever pulled. You disobeyed my orders. You pulled your men away from their posts, using them to indulge in some personal vendetta. I'm sorry sir, I didn't think. You never do. This is a military school, Sonny. I can't bail you out every time you screw up. You're lucky I don't court martial you. Now get out of here. Do you think we'll make it? Don't think about that. Just think about getting to the highway. Somebody's gotta find us before it's too late. The highway, Craig, the highway. There it is. Oh thank god. Oh shit. We're cut off. I wish Roger was here. He'd know what to do. Well he's not here dammit. We're on our own now. Pete, I'm scared. Join the club. We're gonna have to make it back to the canyons. We've got a chance there. Let's stick to the rough terrain and stay low. Over there, over there I see them. Go get them. You go with him, I'll go get the colonel. They're coming! Move! Argh ugh! Ugh. Ugh! Argh! Pete! Come on. Here. Am I glad to see you. I thought you had it for sure. Woo, yeah me too. I put one of them out of action. I don't know where the other one is. How did you get away? He flipped his bike trying to follow me up the hill. Shh. I think he's still here. He killed Smitty, smashed his skull. It was awful. - Smitty? Those bastards, we've got to find them. Well there's nothing but dead ends down there. They'll be back this way any minute. Come on. We've got to find a way. We did it. We did it, we got those son of a bitches. What have we done, Pete? What have we, what have we done? What the hell are you talking about? What the hell are you talking about? We just killed two human beings. Dammit, Craig, they were trying to kill us! We're not like them. We're not murderers. I'm not a murderer! Listen, we're not getting to make the rules here. They are. And the only way we're gonna get out of here is to fight. Maybe we could talk to these guys. They're humans. Human beings can talk to each other. Sure, they killed Roger and we killed some of their guys. So that makes it even. We can reason with them. We could go back and we could talk to them, and just call this whole thing off. Wrong, bullshit. This isn't a game. This is reality, Craig. We aren't counting footsteps. We're trying to survive. We're trying to get out of here. We're trying not to get killed, do you get it? Then we have to get to the highway. Stop it, Craig, stop it. Now there were four of them at the highway, remember? Now one of them is either still there waiting for us, or he's gone for the others. Either way, the highway is out of the question. Then we have to head back to Los Cruz. Christ, Craig, Craig, Craig, come on. We've come too far to turn back now. We have to make it to Glory. Wait a minute. Think about it. Maybe it's a little bit farther, but we know the way. And that will save us time. And we know where the waterholes are. We don't know what the hell's out there. Jesus Christ, that's where the crazies are. Do you wanna run back into them? I'm tell you, Glory is our only chance. But it's open desert, we'll be sitting ducks out there. No, no, no, and we'll stick to cover as much as we can. Now, all we have to do is head toward El Diablo. Then we can't get lost. Now come on, come on, are you okay? Yeah, yeah. Come on. Do you think they've found their friends yet? Probably. Man, what I wouldn't give to be back home right now. Watching TV with a cold beer in my hand. If I ever get another chance. We haven't blown this chance yet. Oh oh, oh damn, oh, the cramp. Relax. - Oh damn it Christ. Relax let me rub it out. Huh, shit, huh huh. I must be getting dehydrated. We both are. Not much left, how's yours. Oh Christ, it must have fallen out. Here, just take a few sips. Right. Agh. How's your leg? It's better. Oh Christ. Craig, over here. Oh, my leg. I've got 'em, come over here. Okay, where are they? I saw something move. It had to be them. Then where are they? I swear to god, they're right here. Fraser this is the third time today. I'm getting tired of chasing ghosts. You didn't see nothing. They're right here in this gully. Well then go down and look for them. Ah just... Hey look what I found. Where did you get this? - Over there. It appears our rats maybe running out of water. Hey Fraser, they can't be two places at one time. Yeah well I'm telling you I saw them. And if you're so damn smart, you go down there and find them. Shh, hold it, hey I think I hear them. Keep it up, Ralph, just keep it up. Fraser you stick by me. If you see anything else, I wanna see it too. Well, they can't be more than a couple of miles in any direction. They're hurting now. Let's get out of this hole. Ah oh. Oh. I think I crossed every pain threshold there is. But you did it, you toughed it out. I shit my pants. Really? Damn near. Oh, oh, ugh. At least we got the water bottle back. Now, where's that waterhole? Roger marked one here. Shouldn't be too far if we can just figure out which way to go. Here's El Diablo so-—- - So we must be right in here. The waterhole can't be more than three or four miles that way. Well, we"ll lose the sun fast I'm gonna sit and let the water run all over me. I'm gonna drink until I can't drink anymore. Dad dad, did you see me? I did a back flip and I wasn't even scared. This is stupid. Another 20 minutes and we won't be able to see a thing. Got to make it to the waterhole. We could run right past it in the dark. We're gonna have to find some cover and get some rest. We'll just have to do without water until morning. We're just getting in, deeper and deeper. This is no military exercise. It's just murder. A soldier can't question his commanding officer in the middle of an operation. Come on, use your head. We're not acting like a military unit. This is a mob. He isn't any commander. This is just some kind of ego trip for him. Look, we all panicked back there, understand. Now he's just getting us in way over our heads. Ugh! Keep your mouth shut, Matthews. There's no room in this unit for back bodgers like you. The colonel is our leader and if I hear one more word out of you, I'll personally shove my foot down your throat. You got that Mr. Insurance Man? Those men could've doubled back. I want you to take Matthews back to the base camp. First light, start combing that area again. Will do. You're doing a first-rate job, Casey. I'm proud of you. Thank-you sir. A little more training I think we can turn this into a crack unit. Baptism under fire. The only way to mold a unit. Well, I better move on out before they settle in. Pete? What's happening? The world's gone crazy, it's a nightmare. I know. It's like I'm having to play this game, and nobody will tell me the rules. You know when you get to thinking about it, it's really funny. Before today, before we came on this run, I thought I had some really tough problems, you know. But when they killed Roger... Oh. Oh my god. I forgot. Roger's dead. Roger. He said the first, you've gotta be able to live with yourself, and everything else will work out. I can't see a damn thing out there. You tell the colonel. - The colonel can't see a damn thing either. Let's go. Those bastards. I hope they search all night. Oh god. Oh god, I'm so tired. Come on, there's the cowboy, rise and shine. Hey Craig, come on. It's almost six o'clock, you're gonna do 10 miles today buddy-boy. Come on, let's go, let's go buddy buddy, chop chop. Shoot it Billy. You're dead sucker. Craig? Craig? Oh, argh, uh, Jesus Craig, it's me. Uh. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry Pete, I thought you were... Ugh, it's okay. What a dream. Yeah, look, there's enough light. We better get going. Let's find that waterhole. Ah, god, I'm so stiff I can hardly move. Oh shit. - I don't believe this. We should've come along last night. How far to the next waterhole. 12, maybe 14 miles. - Oh. I can't make it that far. Me neither. They're all on one side of the waterhole. Maybe if we circle around quietly, we can get in and get out without them noticing us. Are you crazy? I'm not gonna go in there. You want water don't you? Yeah. Let's go. I've got an idea. Let's steal one of their bikes, and ride the rest of the way. You are crazy, aren't you? You, you've ridden one before haven't you? Just a 125, nothing this size. Shh, shh, but the basic principles are the same, aren't they? I mean, can't you get one started and get us out of here before they're on us? They'd catch us before we got 20 yards. And even if we got away, they have bikes too and they know what they're doing. Oh okay, okay okay, then we'll, we'll put them on foot. How? - Well, we're burn their bikes and while they're putting the fire out, we'll get out of here, how's that? Great, if it works. Just get me one little start. Get it yourself. Here, give me your bandana. Shh shh. Come on. Go! Hey! - Hey! Cut them off! Don't let them get away! Save the left. - Too hot, oh agh. Take another one. - Take it, ah! No, let them go. - Ah no. Go, go. Get into second, get into second. I'm trying, I'm trying. Come on, you're making it go. Argh. Damn it, they're still with us. Got you, got you. Ugh, huh. - Argh! Urgh! Ugh, ugh, ugh. Your head's bleeding. Are you okay? Oh, I think so. - Come here. There's only one way to go. We're gonna have to climb. Can you see all right. Yeah, come on, let's go. Do you have room for the water bottle? Yeah, get it in my pack. How high are we? - High. I don't know if this is the right time to tell you or not, I'm scared of heights. I'm so far beyond scared you don't wanna know about it. Oh god. Just hunt them out. Oh. Oh, huh. It should be easier from here now. There's El Diablo. At least we know where we are. Doesn't look a damn bit closer. It's a lot closer. Still damn near 20 miles. Come on! Hey, hey, hey over here. Help, over here. Keep... Oh, they... No. - Got to make it to the rocks. Yah! - Ch ch. Yah, get him! Yah! - Ugh, ugh. Holy Christ. I gotcha. - Ah, ugh. God, damn. You wanted me, punk. Egh! - Ugh. Where're you gonna run to now, little, friend? Huh, huh? - Eh huh. Ah. Urgh! Oh. - Nowhere to run baby, nowhere to hide. Now that you're mine! Ugh! Where are you going to run to, little friend? Ow! Hey, hey, look, that horse is still down there. If we can catch him. Easy boy, easy. Now, just act like we don't care. We've got all the time in the world. Nice horsey, nice horsey. Oh please be a nice horsey. Woo boy. I don't he... Woo boy. Damn it, woo boy, woo. Hang on, hang on. It's not fair. It's just not fair. I know. I've had it. But I'll be god damned if we're gonna quit. Come on. I'd like to buy the world a Coke In perfect harmony I'd like to buy the world a Coke And keep it company Hey Pete, can't you see what I see? Oh, it's gotta be, right? We're gonna make it. - We're gonna make it. Easy now, come on. Sonny, you killed Sonny. No. Pete, what are you doing? I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch. Pete, he can't hurt us anymore. Get away from me. Tie right here and around here. Okay, come on now, let's go show mom. I don't know, they should've been here long ago. All right, Fay. Listen, there are a million things that could've slowed them down. I know, I just wish they'd get back that's all. Well, Craig certainly hasn't maintained the pace that I set for him. You go on. - Hell no. I'll slow you down. - We're doing this together. Come on! Hang on, there it is. Mom mom, they're coming, they're coming! Come on guys. - Yeah, come on! Where's Roger? Where is he? Oh god, sheriff. - Move back some. Come on give them some air. - I'll get some water. Go get some water. Right there.
