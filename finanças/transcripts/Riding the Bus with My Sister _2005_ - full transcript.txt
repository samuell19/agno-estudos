Captioning sponsored by CBS and Hallmark Cards Good Morning! Ha-ha! I hope you have a nice day, Beth. Jesse! Hi, Beth! Hi! We have to get a new toilet seat! Mine got broke! Okay. Bye. Yeah. Love you. I love you! Excellent. There you are! Yes, Daddy. Hi, honey. You okay? Yes, I'm okay, I'm okay, 'cause I'm the sheriff. Yeah. You have to take me to SuperSave tomorrow because they're having a sale. Okay, I got to pick you up at 6:00? Yeah, 6:30. I love you. I have to go. I have to go catch a bus. No, not Jack Russells. I said something old-fashioned, like collies. Just do it. I got you coffee. It's on the counter. Thanks. How about checking the editor's notes on my last chapter? I can't, honey. I've got a shoot. You said you would. Baby, I'm late. What do you think you are, a hippopotamus? The way you clomp down the steps every morning? Some people are still sleeping! Not you. You're not sleeping. You're complaining. That's what you're doing. You're the hippopotamus! I hope you got the dogs. I want the cover. I got the dogs. I'm first! Who's racing? You're second. You know, you're always first with me, Beth. Every day you are first person on my bus. Yeah. She'd kill somebody to get on first. I wouldn't. I wouldn't kill. She's got no place to go-- just rides around all day. So? It's a free country. I'm a person. I buy my bus pass for 40 bucks, and I'm first always, so that's why I'm first. Yeah, you do it on the government dole. Why don't you do something useful in your life? Okay, Henry. Where is Beth going today? I'm gonna go to Elm, and then I'm gonna catch a bus with Rick. Rick is your new favorite. Yeah, because he has a... he has a green car and he's cute. The green Mustang-- very classy. Yeah. I think he's gonna take me for a ride in it. What about your boyfriend? What about Jesse? Jesse's delicious. He's gonna take me today to get a new toilet seat, because mine got broken and was sliding. So I would fall off of it, like, whoa! Everybody out. Bring in the puppies. Dogs! I said dogs, not puppies. I know, but they're cute. Okay, if you could just... sit up. The dress weighs 98 pounds. Try the other side. I'm trying! Posture. Just left shoulder forward an inch. These puppies! I can't... She's gonna cry. I know. Makeup! It's okay. It's okay. Sweetheart... Listen, it's easy. Here's the story. You just got married, and you're floating. Okay? Floating. What do you think? Light's good. Lovely. That's lovely. Come on, sweetheart. You can do it. The kids don't like me... and I'm allergic to dogs. My savior! Ha-ha! I'm not your savior. I'm just Beth. Cool Beth. Miss Boring Clothes. What, am I scaring you? Want me to scare you? Boo, boo, boo! Beth. Yes. Pay her no mind. She's just a harmless retard. Just don't make eye contact. I'm hearing you! So, Rick, when are you gonna take me for a ride in your car? The green car with my caseworker? Ho, Olivia? Yes, Olivia. She's pretty and she's nice... There's the house where Mean Eugene lives. I think he's a jerk. Do you think he's a jerk, Rick? I don't think he's a jerk. I think he's a little impatient. Yeah, well, he put up that sign in the bathroom that says only employees can use it. That didn't stop you, though, did it? No, because I'm a person, and it's just a bathroom. If I use it, I don't think I'm hurting anybody. Sometimes I go in there if I don't have to go to the bathroom, just to wash my hands to make him mad. Okay... we're gonna switch ideas here. You've been left at the altar. You're lovely. Lovely, lovely. Arch your back. Look in the sky. Head up. It's lovely-- the hair on your left cheek is catching the light. I don't have a hair on my left cheek! Be realistic, Rick. Be, be... open your eyeballs, and you can see that he's a little bit of a jerk. Okay... Okay... Shanae, you're growing! Yeah, I'm big as a truck. Sit here, sit here. You want to feel him kick? Could I? Go ahead. Put your hands on my tummy. He's moving all over the place. Well... My goodness! Rick! Rick, you want to touch that? I'm driving here, Beth. Yeah. Yeah. I-I have something to show you. Yeah? What? Look. Look.... This is my niece and my nephew, - Alex and Maddie. - Adorable. Yeah. I love 'em so much. I never met 'em, but my... my brother says, "I'm bringing 'em over." Bobby. They're cute. They're so cute. Yeah. Thank you. Studio. Yeah. Just a sec. Hey, Rachel. It's your stepmother. Tell her I'm on assignment. I'll call her back later. Hi. Um, can I take a message? Okay, thanks. Bye. We need to soften this. It's good, but it's not perfect. Okay, Jesse, here they are. I like the fishies! What do you like? This-this one, this one. This one's soft, so... Aw, but, Jesse, that one's ugly. Nobody wants to sit on that. Sorry. You know me. I'm fussy. Yeah. Ha-ha! We need some help. I'll get it. Could we have assistance, please, in row number one for toilet seats? Hello?! Toilet seat assistance in row number one! Thank you! Who runs this joint anyway? We need to line up Celine. She has the right look. Talk to Marcel and get the dates. Let's go to Careyes. I really... I like the rock formations in the bay there. So who called? Tell my stepmother I'll call her later. I can't deal with it right now. Look, I have to go. I have another call. I'm so sick of eating dinner while you're on the phone. So I turned it off. Thank you. We're not talking anyway. Okay. So... you and I. What are we gonna do? I can't have a baby now. You know it. Well, you're not getting any younger. We can always adopt, remember? We decided we'll get married in a couple years, and we'll adopt a little girl from China. You make it sound like we decided to get a puppy. Listen, I just want us to enjoy life. You know, smell the roses. We enjoy life. Beth?! 'Livia! I tried to reach you at home, but I missed. You must have already left. Yeah, well, I was here. Would you like, would you like a cookie? It's chocolate flavor. Very nutritious. No, thanks, but um, is there someplace we can go? What for? Beth, your dad... I'm afraid your father has had a heart attack. No. No, Olivia. My dad's takin' me to SuperSave. I'm gonna go catch Rick's bus. Beth... No. Beth, slow down. He's had... he's had surgery. I think you might... You might just want to... Beth! Move! Move! Move! Move! Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me. I just gotta... What's wrong? Beth's dad is in the hospital; massive heart attack. You okay, Beth? Yeah. Time to start the bus. Let's go. You're goin' slow, Rick. I'm gonna report you! Beth... No. No, Olivia. Everybody has a schedule. If I've got a schedule. I'm going to go on Happy Timmy's bus today. That's the way it is. Beth, can I call someone for you? Rick, you're cute, but your clothes are faded. And they're not very nice. I mean, look at my clothes. They're very bright. I give everybody lots of color. Where is he? St. Matthew's. Beth, listen to me. No. Your dad's in the hospital. Yeah. I have to go to the hospital! I'll take you there. It's not your route! It's Pradlip's route to Dugan Street. Not yours. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got kind of an emergency here. We're going to take a short detour, if you don't mind. Mr. Worth, it might make you a little late for your doctor's appointment. He's a quack anyway. Go for it. No. No. Morris Simon? Where's my daddy?! To your right. Thanks. Where's my daddy?! Move! He's in a coma. He's unconscious. He won't even know you're here. Yes, he will 'cause he's knowing... I think it's important for Beth to see her dad. - Move! - Go ahead. I want to see him! Daddy... Daddy! I didn't want you to see him this way. I knew it would upset you. Daddy, does it hurt you? It's me, the Sheriff. Dad, can you hear me? Dad, you were gonna take me to SuperSave today. You have to wake up! You have to wake up! It's you and me. Dad, we make a good team. It's you and me. He's not going to die, is he? Beth, please, not so loud. No, but he's not gonna die, right? Maybe you'd like to come outside and sit down. Maybe you should do something! You just stand there. You're doing nothing. Beth, please, calm down. It's time we let your dad rest. No, it's not time! I'm going to stay here! It's not time! You have to cooperate! You're not my mother! You're not, and this is my daddy! You're going to wake up. You're going to wake up. Wake up. Hello? Rachel Simon, this is Beth Simon. Our daddy is dead. "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, "till thou return unto the ground; "for out of it wast thou taken: "for dust thou art, "and unto dust thou shalt return." Amen. Now, it is traditional for our mourners to symbolically complete the burial with the throwing of dirt into the grave. No... I'm not gonna put any dirt on him. You don't have to. I don't think it's right to throw dirt on somebody. Don't make a scene, Beth. All these people are here to honor Daddy. Well, then you tell 'em not to throw dirt on him! I don't like it. I don't like it. I'm not doing it. I'm not throwing dirt on him. Beth, what are you eating? Rachel, that is not funny! How many times do I have to tell you? Beth is just like you: fingers and toes and eyes and nose and ears. But she's different. She's just different. And you have to understand that. You have to take care of her. Forever? Yes, forever. Get in the house. I want my daddy. I don't wanna leave him there in that dirty ground. You know, Beth, I was thinking that maybe you should be getting something to eat. No, no. Hey, you know Mrs. Brimhall? She rides the bus on Saturdays? You know what she did? She gave me a casserole to bring here today. How about that? How about you, Jesse? It's okay, Jesse. You can eat. It wasn't your daddy that died. How about I fix you a plate? No. I fix for Jesse. Wait right there. See? You're not alone here, Beth. Everybody's here: all your friends, and your brother and your sister. You can forget about my sister. She got a boyfriend. Sure. You want a deviled egg, Jesse? I realize this is a very difficult, sad time for all of you, but we have a problem with Beth. Can one of you be here next week for her plan-of-care meeting? I'm already behind schedule. I have a shoot in Mexico. I have to fly back to Tucson tonight. I wouldn't know what to do. I'm not Beth's mother. Well, would it be possible to get your real mother involved? Forget it. Beth has been living independently, but her dad has been very involved, and I'm worried that... It's a problem. She doesn't want to get a job. Beth has trouble dealing with authority. It's made it hard for her to keep jobs. She doesn't want a job. She just wants to ride the buses. Look, I'm doing all I can do, but I have a heavy caseload. Beth needs some measure of supervision. Rachel... it would be good if you stayed over the weekend. Just sort out your father's things. Then maybe you could make the meeting on Monday. Somebody has to get her on track, and it's not my responsibility. Beth has been deserted by everyone. You have no right to judge us. It wasn't our fault. Breathe, Bethie, Breathe. Bethie, breathe. Come on, baby! She's not breathing! Rachel, call your father! I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. Rachel. I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Breathe... Rachel, I would stay if I possibly could. You know that. I'm trapped. Beth is just a dead weight. I'm trapped. Why do you have to go, Bob? Why do you have to go? Well, I have to get back to Janice and the kids tonight. Yeah, well, what about their Christmas presents? Their Christmas presents? Yeah, I do Christmas. I don't care! I got presents for 'em last year for Alex and Maddie. Well, I'll get 'em next time, I promise. Yeah? Why don't you bring 'em over to see me? 'Cause I love 'em, Bobby. I will. Someday soon. Okay? Okay. Promise? Yeah. Yeah, listen, you're my baby brother. I don't want you to go. You have to be strong, Beth. No, I don't. I don't have to be strong. This is my only brother I got. Look, look... I... I'll call you. Yeah? Yeah. And I'll write to you, I promise. Promise? Yeah. Yeah. All right, look, you and me and Rachel-- we've been through a lot. Right? Right. And we're going to get through this 'cause we love each other. Right. Bye. Bye. Bye. Yeah, bye. I'm going to stay for a few days. Go through Dad's stuff. Yeah, well, you'll like my place. It's really nice. No, I'm going to stay with Valerie. You know, she's alone, for these first few days. Valerie don't like me. Remember that time I took two dollars out of Dad's wallet and he, he... She made him put me in a home. And I don't like her, either. It wasn't just that and you know it. You've never been very nice to Valerie. No, that's because she's bossy. SuperSave's having a sale on soda. 24 cans of soda for six bucks. You got to take me. So that's why you want me to stay? Well, it's hard to carry that much soda cans on a bus. Okay, I'll take you in the morning. Yeah? Yeah. So it's you and me now, Rachel. That's just the way it is. That's just the way it is. Look at that spider web. So sparkly-- like diamonds-- Tickle me. No. Why did you get a black car, Rachel? Why'd you get a black car?! Just wait, Beth. Yeah, it's locked. Black cars are ugly. Wait. I don't like... Just wait. Can't you hear me? Yeah, I heard you. It's locked. I don't think black cars are good. I like... I like blue cars or green cars like Rick. Who's Rick? He's a bus driver. You met him at the funeral. I don't remember. Have you been waiting long? Two hours. Why didn't you wait inside? Because you couldn't see me in there. I have your address. Honestly, Beth, you know, you just make things harder on yourself. Buckle up for safety. You eat all this junk. You're getting fat. So? I'm worried about you-- your health. We're going to get you some brown rice and vegetables and I'm going to teach you how to cook it. I won't cook it. Of course you will. I won't. Okay... I want you to put the cart away. Dad does it. Dad isn't here. Yeah, well, I'm too tired. Someone could hit it. Someone could get hurt. I don't care. You don't care if someone gets hurt? Well, I don't know who "somebody" is, so no. I know why Dad called you the Sheriff. 'Cause I always get what I want. Ha-ha! Rachel, I put seven red fishies inside of this can. Do you think they can swim in cola? I hope so. I would hate to drown them. Rachel, I never knew vegetables were so heavy. These bags are much heavier than my usual food shopping. Are you sure you don't want a doughnut? I don't want a doughnut. I left it open. That was a mistake. All right... You like it? You like my place? Yeah. It's homey. Look, look, remember this? This is Daddy's chair. Remember when Daddy would sit in the chair and I was brushing his hair and I put a ribbon in and he didn't know? That was a good one. Me and Daddy-- at least we got each other. But... now we don't. Hey, I got your Christmas present-- right here. You can open it if you want to. Thank you. You're welcome. Wow. Cute. You like it? Olivia said it was practical. Speaking of practical-- did you get the sweater I sent you? Yeah. I gave it away. What? Yeah. That was a very nice sweater. It was expensive. ! Yeah. I didn't like it. I'm fussy. You know, you can't leave stuff on the stove like this. It's dangerous. You could start a fire. It's all right. The stove don't work. How are we going to cook the food? I told you I wouldn't cook it. Okay, kids, let's wash up. Your dad's on his way home. Bethie, no, honey, you can't eat that. It's paint. It's poison. You can't eat it. Rachel, I told you to look after her! I told you to watch her! Daddy? Yeah? She's not going to die? No. No, honey, Beth's not going to die. Good. Okay. Go to sleep now, okay? Good girl. Beth, you have to start eating healthy, being responsible, or else they're going to put you back in a group home. That's okay. I'll run away. Come on, kids, sit in the back. I'm good with kids. That's what they say because it's true. That's right, Beth. And kids love you. Yes. I can't have any kids. Beth. Well, it's true. They had my tubes tied up. But that's okay because then I don't have to worry when I'm with Jesse. You know what I mean? Stella, do you like marshmallows? I love marshmallows. Me, too. We got something in common. The kind with the sugar on the top? I haven't had those. I have them sometimes at holidays. They make them for holidays. My ex isn't here, is he? He already rode today. I could fix him up with someone else, get him off your hands. I couldn't do that. Pass him on to another poor sucker? Never. Come on, girls. They're not all bad. Yeah? I just chose bad men-- one after another-- till I got smart. Nothing so bad you can't change. That's very smart what you said. Women don't want good men. They want doctors and lawyers. Hi there, Jesse. Jesse! Jesse! That's a good man. That's my boyfriend, Jesse! We know, Beth. So shut up. Here we are. Do not stand until the bus is fully stopped. We got it, honey. All right. See ya tomorrow. Okay, see ya later, sweet potater. Good one, Stella! Bye, Rachel. Bye. You take care now? Come back anytime. Did you have to wear that? You should try and make a good impression. It's all right. They know me here. Cool Beth. It's okay. Your father was such a great guy. I know that Beth is going to miss him a lot. I am. I'm missing him already. 'Cause he was calling me every day. Well, that's why we're here today, Beth. Because your dad won't be able to call you every day or help you out with the shopping or all the other things he did for you. No. I'll manage. There are some health issues. Your cholesterol is still very high. It's the Ring-Dings, the chocolate pudding and the junk. Yeah, it's my body. I eat what I like. I like hot dogs. I like spaghetti and meatballs in a can. I like... I like everything with marshmallows. That isn't gonna help your cholesterol. You could develop a heart problem. That's not gonna happen. But it could. It's not gonna. Beth is an adult. She has to make her own choices. And we must respect that. You haven't seen a dentist in a couple of years. I brush my teeth every day. She means for a thorough cleaning. I will let him look inside of my mouth, but he can't put his fingers in there. I'm not going to do that. We also have some concerns for Beth's safety. I'm safe. But with your father gone... He was gone before. He went to live with Valerie. Why are you going? I'll see you every weekend, honey. But you won't live with us? I'm sorry. I'll pick up the rest tomorrow. Why is he going? He's fallen in love with someone else. ...'cause I have a lot of friends, I do. I have Rick, I have, Pradlip. I have Happy Timmy. And... not Mean Eugene. Eugene's not my friend. What about a class? Would you like to take a class? No. Therapy? No. What about a goal? I have a goal. To go to Disney World with Jesse. And to spend a whole day with my niece and my nephew. Beth, you ride the bus all day long. Not Sundays. Isn't there something more... challenging, more productive that you can do? - I don't... - I don't think you understand. Um... Beth knows all the drivers and the passengers and their families and their problems. She's involved in their lives, and they're involved in hers. The bus... is a family for Beth. Beth has a family. Good. Then you're willing to come and stay with Beth, help her get on her feet. I... We'll see how it goes. Let's try three months. I have a career. I have a very demanding schedule. I have commitments... a business. Beth was very dependent on your father. If you can't come and help her make this transition, I'm not sure she'll be able to take care of herself. You don't mean you would send her back to a group home? She... That didn't work before. She hated it. Yeah. I'm gonna go now. I think I'm gonna go now. Okay? Beth. Yeah? Let's go have lunch somewhere. We need to talk. I have no time. Well, this is important. All right. This is about your future. About... about what? We need to talk about your future. You know, I send you checks. Why don't you cash them? I could help you. Because I get money from the government, Rachel. That's the rules. That's how it is. I got to catch the bus. I have to go. All right. Beth, how do I get up to Marion? Is it the Five or what? No, the Five don't go to Marion. You got to take the 11. You cross over the street on Evans then you get a transfer. I transfer on Evans? Yes! You take the... cross the street, you transfer at Evans. Cross from Evans? I told you two times. You really have to listen. Be nice. I tell people two times, Rachel. If they don't listen, it's their own fault. Here comes the bus. Here comes the bus. Here comes the bus. Beth, you know... What? You know, maybe a group home would not be such a bad idea. No. It doesn't have to be the same group home. No, thank you. Maybe one that has, you know, that could... that could have art. No. And they could have fun things to do. No. No. And you could meet people like yourself. They're not like me, Rachel. You know it. 'Cause I'm different. Wait up, Beth. Hello. Hello, Beth. You must be the famous sister. Well, I don't know... Beth shows me your photograph. Beth is very proud of her sister. I don't have a ticket. And I don't have much change. She don't know how to ride the bus. Does someone have a nickel? Thanks. I have a dollar. Give it up, lady. Nickel don't buy nothing. Thank you. Look! Look, that's Rick's bus. He's on the 5:30 today. He's on the 5:30, because Benny got sick. Benny's got the flu and a temperature. Beth knows everything that is happening every day. That's my job. Beth is my first friend when I started to drive the bus. I was nervous about my route, but she talked me through it. Yeah, 'cause he was on the Number Eight and he didn't know he had to go up to Beale Street, do a turnaround, and... They don't do that anymore now. You go to Elm Street. That's just the way it is. We are most grateful. Beth gave my wife a beautiful sweater. I told you. So, you gonna stay with me? Beth, I'd like to, but... Yeah, but you gotta get me on my feet, they says. I have a life. I can't just walk away. Yeah, just three months, then I'm settled. I can't. My dad saved everything. I have so much junk to go through. I just thought it was best that I stay, got things straightened out. You're so quiet. I've been doing some thinking while you were gone. That sounds ominous. I wanted to be at the funeral. You didn't include me. Believe me, I did you a favor. My family... That's just the point. Your family. I didn't even know you had a sister. I was trying to spare you. Spare me from what? She's retarded. Didn't even know they used that term anymore... "retarded." Is that why you never wanted to have kids? No. Absolutely not. My brother's kids are perfectly normal. I'm gonna go home. Why? Why? Because I just realized you treat us all the same. Nothing gets in the way of your career. That's not true. I stayed four extra days listening to her babble, riding her stupid buses, eating horrible food. Sam... Come on. Don't be silly. I've just got a lot on my mind. I didn't mean to be cruel about Beth. You have no idea what I've had to deal with my whole life. I've always looked after her. I still look after her. I send her a check, every month, she sends it back. I can't look after her every minute. It's a full-time job. I'm sorry, Rachel. Maybe I could have helped you with all this. But it's a little late now. You are so virtuous and wonderful. Maybe Beth should move in with you. Here comes your sister. Don't... Rachel... That embarrassed you? Your little sister so happy to see you? Beth will always be in plain sight as part of this family. You have to get used to that. We'll never put her in an institution. Never. Pradlip. Beth said you went home to New York. I came back. Do you know where she is? Well, she was on my last run. She told me she was going to the park with Jesse. She's going to be very happy to see you. Thanks. That's good, Jesse! Looks very nice! That's a nice one, Jesse! Do the kung pao wow one. Yeah, like boom! The kick one is good! Like, yeah. Like a boom-boom! Ooh, a punch. I like the punch one. Hey, Jesse, look what I'm doing. I'm making a cookie mountain. What? What?. Hello, Rachel. Hi, Beth. That's tae kwon do. What Jesse's doing. See his black belt? I-I coulda went further. Yeah, he coulda got a... got a first degree or a second degree, but, but that was with swords. A-A-And knives. Yes, and knives. So he decided just to do the... do the basics so he could build up his confidence. I-I didn't have none of that. No, but you do now, Jesse. Now you do. Do you mind if I take some pictures? No. Yeah, Jesse, that's okay. Say sure. Say yeah. Please? Rachel, you can take some pictures. Okay. Okay. That's nice. You came back! Rachel, would you like a picture of a cookie mountain? Good one. I don't care. Cancel Mexico. They can find somebody else. Tell them my father died. I have some things I have to take care of here. I'm not a "thing." I don't know how long. A few weeks. Maybe a month. I'm serious. Okay, thanks. So where do you want me to put my stuff? What? Where do you want me to put my stuff? You can't stay here tonight, Rachel. I have a date. With Jesse. We're going out to dinner. We're gonna come back here to watch Animal Planet. Gonna have some sno-cones and we're going to be fooling around. So, you can't stay here. Tough. You wanted me here. Here I am. But it's not a good time. I broke up with my boyfriend because of you. He said I was cold and that I didn't care. I do care. I want to be... better. I want to be... a better sister. You broke up with your boyfriend? Yes. Sam. Sam. He's kind and funny and he wanted to marry me. Do you love him? Yes. I blew it. That's sad... For you. Yes. Yeah. All right, you can come to dinner with me and Jesse, but you have to pay. That's very generous. Would you? That's a great idea. All right, then let's go. You know, Jesse will be waiting. I'm going to take just one for the bus. Okay, Jesse, because you can get whatever you want. Rachel's gonna pay for dinner. They don't like me here. Whenever I come to use the bathroom, they say no. We can eat somewhere else. That's all right. Table for three, please. Yeah, three, please. One, two, three. Can we sit there, please? Of course. A lot of choices. Okay? Um... Okay. Let me see. Um... Okay? Do you have chicken fingers? Yes. We have chicken fingers. Yes, one order, please, for the gentleman. And for you, dear? Well, you'll have to excuse me, because I have to use the bathroom. I'll come back later. I want a glass of merlot... and you? Okay. So, Beth tells me you have all kinds of jobs. You mow grass... ride your bike through the park and report to the police if anybody acts funny. Yes. Yes, ma'am. I wish Beth would get a job. They... they fire her all the time. You really care about her. I... I love her. What do you love about her? sh-she-she's real funny. Did we get our basket of rolls yet? You get free rolls at this restaurant in a basket. No, no! No, Jesse! Rachel! Did you get that for Jesse?! No! He's on medication. I, I forgot. That all right, Jesse. It's not your fault, but Rachel! When I'm not here, you have to be in charge! You have to tell him things like remind him to wear his bike helmet and not to have any wine! Don't be stupid, Rachel. I'm sorry. Yours good, Jesse? Mommy got us ice cream cones. She was nice. She was pretty and she was nice. She changed after Dad left, though. I guess she was just overwhelmed. Three kids. And me. I'm a big job. Look, Rachel! The moon's following us! That's enough. I said that's it. Moon's following us. The moon's not following us, Beth; it's just there. It is following us. Yes, it is, Beth. Yeah. No matter where you go, if you try to run or hide or anything, the moon'll always find you. It's always watching. The bus! Come on! We can take a cab, Beth. No, that's expensive! Good morning. You are listening to KAWZ, and a sunny day it promises to be with highs in the 80s today. Looks like that high pressure system will stick around for another couple of days, so that the next few days... Time to wake up! Are you sure? Yes! This is when everything begins. Who are you calling? 'Livia. Does she work this early? No. It's her machine. 'Livia, it's me. It's gonna be in the high 80s. You should wear shorts. Ready? We're gonna get going. Won't she be dressed by the time she gets to work? Yes, but it's okay, because... because it's okay. She likes it when I call her. Hurry up, Rachel. Gotta get going. I'm still waiting! Coffee, please. Thank you. Come on, you're missing it. Come on. Hi, Mike! Hi. You're an angel, Beth. Thanks, Mike! This is my sister, Rachel! Her boyfriend dumped her! She doesn't like meat, like you, and she only eats vegetables! I think you guys will make a good match! Come on, Rachel. That's our bus! That's our bus! Good news. My sister broke up with her boyfriend. And she likes to read books, like you do. And I think you two are a very good match. Beth, will you stop? I'm not looking for a guy. Some people say that they believe in Martians, but I don't know. Hey, Beth, you been told. This is for bus drivers only. Jerry and Mr. Pack have been letting me in. Yeah, well, the bosses aren't here today, are they? Okay, Eugene. Hey, you encourage this obnoxious behavior. Enough! It's for drivers! Mean Eugene is a jerk. No, no. Maybe he has difficult life. Maybe he is hurting. I don't care! Of course you do. Don't I always hear you say that you love all mankind? No! I don't say that, Pradlip! You must be confusing me with someone else for I've never said that word! All right. All done. Rachel, this is everybody. That's Mitchie right there. He's got twin boys. His wife says they're wild ones. That's the Hulk right there, because he's big. That's Marion. She made a chocolate cake for Daddy's funeral, but she put mayonnaise in it. I don't even know why she did it. That is the Professor. and he's very smart, but he's not for you because he's married. Happy Birthday. Well, thank you, Beth. You're welcome. But my birthday's still a couple of months away. Yeah! That's okay! Good-bye, everybody! Have a nice day of safe driving! You're a big galoot! I never heard you so quiet, Rick. Why don't you say something? Why don't you say something to my sister? Well, Beth... I'm speechless. Well, then, I'll tell you what to say-- words. Tell her that she's pretty, 'cause she is and you should maybe take her on a date, 'cause I know you want to, Rick. I know you do. Yeah. She never shuts up. She should get a job. Quit living off the government. You just passed Zone One, and she doesn't have a Zone One pass. You should put her off unless she pays extra, which she never does. Put her off. She's a pest. She's cheating the system. She should be out on that road right now. I'm going to report this. Day after day I see her riding without a permit, and she drives everybody nuts. Ladies and gentlemen... I'm very serious about my driving, and I'm responsible for a lot of lives here, and I don't appreciate people being mean to other people on my bus. Okay? Beth, would you please show them your pass? Zone One! Zone One. Thank you very much. Now, can we all just chill out? You, Beth. You chill out. Okay! I'm chilling out! Zone One! I'm listening to my radio! Zone One! Beautiful. Unbutton your shirt! Unbutton your shirt! He's sexy, right? Very sexy. Yeah, yeah. Why don't you ask her out on a date. Because I know you want to. Beth, leave him alone. No kissing! No kissing me, but my sister's available. Come here, you. No. I like hugging that way. You play pool? What does she mean when she says, "I don't kno-"? Well, when she says, "I don't know" without any stress on any word-- that means she doesn't know. When she says, "I don't kno-" like you're asking, that means she does have an answer, but it's unlikely you'll be hearing it. I used to dread seeing her, but then I started looking forward to that big smile in the morning. We're all very fond of her. We feel very protective. Except Mean Eugene. Well, she can be tough if you cross her. Beth might not have as much to offer as a lot of people, but she gives it all she's got. Well, I think she can make progress. That's why I'm here. You know, not a day goes by on that bus when someone doesn't make fun of her or get really impatient with her. Just go easy on her. Don't expect too much. You know the number two washer doesn't work so good. Okay. We're going to skip that one, all right? All right. All right. One time I put my clothes in. They didn't come out clean. I don't know why. Hey, Beth. Here, I got something for you. Who's that man? Don't look at him. He gives me the creeps. He gives me stuff every day. Rick is hot! Did you put the soap in? Yeah. One cup. Ricky Martin, too. He's hot. Yeah. Hotter than a stove. Yeah, hotter than a summer day. Will Smith is very hot, too. If he was here right now, Rachel, do you know what I would do to him? Beth! Yes! What about Jesse? I love Jesse. I don't love Will Smith. I don't even know him. What is love? Why do you got to ask that for? You got a problem? I don't know. Love just happens, that's all. It just happens. You just love somebody. That's how... that's what it is. You just love somebody. Let me put it another way. What do you love about Jesse? I don't kno. I love... I like kissing him. And I like... love... I love the way he looks and I love... I love that he's nice to me all the time. That's it? Yeah. You ask a lot of questions. Stupid ones. I think you should have asked our mama. She would tell you more about boyfriends. Remember that... remember that one boyfriend? Clark Kent? There was a lot of them. There was that other guy named Bobby. They called him Bobby Spaghetti, 'cause his shirt always had spaghetti stains. Remember him? Now you be good tonight. You do everything Caroleen says, okay? Look, I want to meet someone. I'm sorry. I have to go out every once in a while. You be good tonight. I won't be back late. Go down and see Caroleen. Come on. I wish we had a water balloon. I would drop it on him. Mama looks nice. She looks pretty. I miss Mama. She would call me up on the phone and I'd tell her that. She says we're better off without her. Think we are? Better off? You know, she has orange trees at her house in her backyard. Maybe sometime you and me can go visit her in California. Maybe. Maybe. What's happening? Too much soap. I'll get the manager. Hello. We need help over here. Beth, the cart. That's your job. I'm setting some limits. You have to do your share. You worry too much. You should be more like me. He won't like it-- what you're cooking. You don't even know what I'm cooking. Forks on the left, knives and spoons on the right. All right. Where is Jesse? Dinner's almost done. Hey, Jesse boy. You get paid today, Jesse? Get off. Come on. Come on. Maybe he forgot. No, no, he doesn't forget things. Okay. Calm down now. Something's wrong! Rachel, something's wrong! Jesse! Jesse! Jesse! No! He's not there! It's okay, Beth. Just calm down. You have to do something! Call Rick! Okay, I'll call Rick. I'll call Rick. My Jesse! Not my Jesse, too! I don't want Jesse to die here because Daddy died here. He's not going to die. He's down here. No, but Daddy did. Jesse! Jesse, I couldn't find you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about supper. Don't you worry about supper, Jesse. Those bad boys. Rick is going to beat them up! I don't think so, Beth. They don't know no better. They don't know right from the wrong. Yeah. That's right, Jesse. You can take him home now. He'll have to get those stitches out in a week. Wow. Jesse, I'm not going to let them put you in the ground like they did my daddy. I decided that. Don't worry. It's not going to happen. It's okay, Beth. He's not going to die. Everybody dies, Rachel. That's the truth. But not today, not Jesse today. Today I'm going to take you... take you home. And I'm going to take care of you really good. Doctor, don't you think it's best that he goes to his own home to rest? Yes. He should go home and rest. To his own home? Is that what you want? I... I... I don't know. Okay, if you say so. Please don't go out at nighttime. I told you five or seven times. Thanks for letting me sleep in. You're doing your Christmas cards already? There's nothing else to do. You're in the living room. Jesse couldn't stay here last night 'cause of you on my sofa. I appreciate you not turning on the TV till I woke up. Rick said I couldn't. Are you upset with me? I don't kno. I thought you liked having me here. I like it when you leave. Okay, I'm going to go take a shower. I can't stop you. Okay, that's not nice. Yeah, but it's the truth, Rachel. You know better. I just said it's the truth. You've been taught. Common courtesies. Like Rick says-- do unto others. Rick. Yeah. Because you were riding in his car. And Jesse, too. He likes you. Everybody likes you. What about me? What about Beth?! Okay... Let's start over. I'm going to go take a shower. I can't stop you. I am sick of this. Sleeping on the couch, taking you on buses, giving up my job to be here with you. Sometimes I just hate you. I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to say that. That was a horrible thing to say. It's horrible. You said you did. I know. I don't hate you. I hate your behavior when you're rude. Maybe I should just leave. Yeah, maybe... maybe you should... go. Need to be at my... sleep at my house every day! It's just one thing after another with her. It's like water dripping on my head-- constant, constant, constant-- and it isn't going away. You can't give up. Yes, I can. She isn't the only one that suffered. Daddy left us and then my mother met this guy. She said he wasn't much of a catch. He drank $200 worth of bourbon a week, smoked five packs of cigarettes a day. He was an ex-con. Then one day, I came home... Rachel. This is Raymond. Raymond will be living with us now. Can't you say hello? Hello. Mom didn't care much about us. Not after she met Raymond. Yeah, I know all about that. Broken homes. Broken families. I have a son. Yeah. He's a teenager. He's got a stepfather now. It's hard having your boy raised by another man. Yeah, I call him. Sometimes he calls back. Sometimes he doesn't, but... I gotta keep trying. Right? That's right. Just gotta keep putting yourself out there. Rachel, it's okay. I have no illusions. No... I'm a bus driver. No, it's not that. I'm not putting it down. I have a life in New York. I know. And Sam. I see a bus. I see a bus. I see two buses. That one heading south, and that one over there heading east. I bet you that's Pradlip. That's very good. That is Pradlip. It's the #12 heading back to Perry Street. Betcha Beth's on there, trying to set me up with some other guy. Good luck. They better get in line. Jesse. I'm leaving. I have to go back to New York. O-Okay. Well, I have some pictures of Beth. I thought you might want a few. No, no, no, thank you. Are you sure? Pictures make, make me think of Beth alone, sad. You're a good man. My, my mama taught me that... you do your best this day and see what the next day be like... and keep moving like that. I'm gonna remember that. You can learn a lot in just one day. Okay, bye. Lovely. It's uncomfortable. It looks good. Arm out, Rosalind. Am I supposed to be dead? You got some more cards from Cool Beth. I know. You're not gonna read them? I told her I hated her. Now I just hate myself. Why? Mama says it's Dad's turn. Where is she? She's in the bedroom with Raymond. That's it? Honey. Beth. Listen. You're, you're gonna stay with your mom, just for now, okay? Give me a hug. See you, kiddo. Bye, Beth. See you soon, okay? Yeah? Hey. Rick? We miss you, Rachel. Is it Beth? No, she's, she's fine. She's upset. I think she's realizing for the first time, the consequences of her actions. It wasn't her fault. None of it's her fault. So, Beth's birthday is coming up, and we're planning this big bash, and... it won't work without you. Beth. I came back. I'm sorry. I'm gonna do better. I've been practicing. I'm... I'm gonna do better. I'm trying, too. See? I knew you would like it. Do you want to get a manicure? No, thank you, 'cause I don't want anyone to touch my fingers. Okay, well, we'll just go home and put on our party dresses. Beth has a new dress. Yeah. Beth. Your hair. I didn't like it. But you're still gonna wear the dress, right? I like this better. I forget, you're fussy. Right. You know, you're right. I like you just the way you are. That's nice. Rachel. That's not supposed to be the 6 bus. Not this route. Rick's gonna be in trouble. Why the 6 bus here? Rick! The bus isn't... Happy birthday! Thank you. 'Cause it's my birthday. Can I blow them now? Yeah. Make a wish. Dogs, dogs... Mustard. Look at me, Jesse. That's nice. Very good. Great, great. Shanae, your baby. Can I hold her? Beth, I don't know. It's so tiny. Of course you can hold her. The bus drivers gave you such a nice party. That was fun. Are you sad? Yeah. Ten years since I can't have a baby. That's what I'm thinking. Are you sorry now that you can't have a baby? I don't know. I don't know the baby. Maybe that baby would cry all the time. But I would love it. That's the most important thing. I'm sorry, Beth. We thought we were doing the right thing. Now, look, Beth, how much did you do with this Jesse? The thing is, you could get pregnant if you're not careful, and everyone knows you're not very careful. I'm sure this Jesse guy is very nice, but do you really want to have a baby? I might. Babies are not dolls. They're not puppies or kittens. Babies get sick. They need constant attention. How would you manage that, Beth? You can't even hook your own bra. Do you really want to take that chance? Do you want to have a baby? Hook my own bra? They make them without hooks. I changed my mind. I changed my mind. In a few minutes, you'll go to sleep. When you wake up, it's gonna be all done. I changed my mind. I changed... my mind. You thought I was too stupid to hook my bra. I'm not stupid. I'm just different. Do you remember when we were little and I used to tickle your arm? Do you remember that? Do you remember that? Yes. Do you want me to tickle you now? Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That's nice. That's nice, Rachel. That's very nice. It gives me a shiver. Is that good? Yes. Want me to do it to you now? I can do it to you now. Okay. Okay. It felt like spiders. I'm not wearing a bathing suit! No way! But you just bought that cute one with the dolphins. Yeah, I love dolphins. You gotta go for it, Beth. Be not afraid! I'm not afraid! It's just too cold. Put your hand up in the storm, Rachel! Wow! You've been good for her, Rachel. You think so? Yeah. Look at her. I've never seen her happier. She's been good for me, too. So have you. I won't forget that. What about Sam? I haven't talked to him. What did I tell you about putting yourself out there? I mean, if it's really important to you. Maybe I'm afraid of rejection. Rejection's good for you. It makes you move on. Rachel, you gotta come in the water! Come on. Okay. Jesse did it. I did it. Now you can. Save me, Rick! You go. Go in the water. Beth is doing very well. She had a tooth pulled last month. She handled it fine. Thank you. The doctor's given you an inhaler for your allergy. Yeah, but I don't use it because it takes so long. I might miss the bus. Beth, you got to do what the doctor says. Otherwise, you could get a bad infection. That's not gonna happen. Okay, are we done? Not yet. What about your budget? You still wasting all this money on junk food? Yes. Beth is an adult. If she doesn't want to be cautious about her meds, her weight or her money, we can only hope that her love of life will push her into taking better care of herself. That's right. You're still riding the bus? Yeah. The bus. The bus is Beth's life. Well, that's all well and good, but Beth should have some goals. I have a goal! I wanna go to Disney World with Jesse and I wanna see my niece and nephew for a whole day. Same as last year. Right. Yes. Do you want to get some ice cream? Yes, I do. Let's go from this place. Okay. So where are we going today? Estella or Happy Timmy or that new driver you were talking about? Three months are over! I'm free. You don't want me to ride anymore? I don't know. There it is! You coming? You can go without me. All right. Yeah. What? You're weird! Well, Beth, so are you. You're weird, but you're cool, too, sometimes. I love you, Rachel. I love you, too. I'm so happy we can show this work at the gallery. You're at a whole new level, Rachel. Who is she? My sister Beth. Excuse me. Sam. I'm so glad you came. I had to be here. What is this, Britney Spears? No, not Britney. I'm Cool Beth. And you're Rodolpho, and you're new. How'd you know my name? You're new 'cause I know everything. Listen, you gotta stop on Carlton Street. Carlton's not a bus stop! Don't listen to Henry. You have to stop there because Mrs. Pack has a swollen-up leg and she's got to go to the doctor at 11:00. So stop on Carlton Street, Rodolpho, and listen to me because I only tell you two times, that's it. Then you're on your own. 'Kay. Rodolpho, if I was you, I'd listen to me. Lots of drivers don't, but they regret it. Would you like to know a little secret? My sister Rachel's going to have a baby! Yes, she is. I'm very good with babies. Everybody knows. Gonna name the baby Stella 'cause it's a girl. Captioning sponsored by CBS and Hallmark Cards
