( Horn honking ) Honey, off the phone, let's go. Hon, the limo is here... finally. What the hell is he doing? He's just sitting there. I don't know. First he's late and now he's being a jerk. You've gotta be kidding me. Just grab the bags and let's get going. This prick can forget about a tip. Just hurry up. Domestic terminal. Step on it. By the way, thanks for the help with the bags. Jerk. Never again are we hiring this company. This is ridiculous. You know who recommended them? Who? Ron. Don't ever listen to Ron! Oh my god, Ron. This is classic Ron. It's the same Ron who said he'd get me on the golf course for half price. ( Laughs ) Ron. You know what happened that day? I paid for four people to go at full price. Well, if you close this business deal, we can buy our own golf course. You know who won't be playing on our course? Ron. Shouldn't we have taken this turn-off? Hey! What the hell are you doing? You're going the wrong way. Turn around. What's your problem? Turn around. If we miss this flight, I'm going to have you fired, jerk! This is unacceptable. Unacceptable. Who does he think he is? Where are we? What's up with this guy? I don't know, it looks like we're in some kind of industrial park. Will, do something. You've pushed this too far! I'm calling the cops. Jackie, something weird is going on. Oh, my God! They have guns!!! Will, they have guns!!! Are you crazy?!!! Please, take what you want, just don't hurt us! If this is a kidnapping, I can get you money! We don't want your money. What is it? You're worth more dead than alive. ( Gun shots ) So after hacking into the satellite, I was able to download loads of data and a clear pattern emerged. The eyes in the sky are fixated on coordinates with very distinctive radioactive signatures, and why is that? Aliens! Mrs. Forrester... Call me Lucy. Did you hear what I just said? Aliens could be watching right now. All my theories are true. I hacked into the satellites... Court order: no hacking, no computer access. We live in the 21st century, and you're my lawyer. That's why I hired you, to stop the government conspiracy against me. And as your lawyer, it's my job to keep you out of jail! No computers? That's like Lord of the Rings with no Gandalf. Ok, relax. Take a deep breath. I am here for you. That is why I'm seeing you on short notice at my house. I promise, I will get that order rescinded as soon as I get back. How do I know you're not just saying this to keep me calm, but in fact you're planning on moving to Europe and working with the world bank and... There's no conspiracy here, and I am not moving to Europe. I am here for you. That is why I took your case pro-bono because I believe that you have a voice, so you've just got to trust me. Ok, I will see you next week. Thank you. Thank you. Ok. Ok. Hey, you ready to go? Just about. You ok? Mmmhmm. You know, we don't have to go if you don't want to go. I know. I just think it'd be good for us to get away, you know, with some new friends. Sure. Great. I'll be outside. See ya. "Welcome to Second Chance Retreat, "where couples go to grow love." Wow, really? They need a new catch phrase. It's not about the catch phrase, Greg. It's about the experience. That doesn't sound any better. It's like any other vacation, only you get to work on your relationship. You do realize you said "vacation" and "work" in the same sentence? Trust us. A couple's retreat can work wonders. It's the secret to our happiness. We go every year. It's like a tune-up for our marriage. ( Laughs ) Leave it to men to compare marriage to cars. So exactly how backwoods is this place? Well, my friends, we get to arrive in style. What does that even mean? It's a surprise. I'm not a fan of surprises. Come on, Lucy. Any chance we'll be stopping soon? We're getting close. We've been driving for, like, three hours. How far is this place? We're not so far away from the departure point. Departure point? What does that mean? Relax. You're about to find out. ( Sirens ) Uh-oh, looks like we've got company. What seems to be the problem? You know you were speeding? No, I'm sorry, I did not. I'll need to see your license and registration. The rest of you folks, can I see your ID as well? Is that really necessary? I'm afraid so, ma'am. We've had a rash of drug runners come through the state. I'm just checking. We have nothing to hide. Alright, you folks hang tight. I'm just gonna run these through the computer. Nothing like small town hospitality. Were you even speeding? No. They're probably just razzing out-of-towners. It all checks out. Where y'all headed? Second Chance Retreat. Right. Have a nice flight. Thank you. Wait, flight? What is he talking about? Like I said earlier, we're arriving in style. Something tells me this is not going to be an ordinary trip. Wow, you weren't kidding when you said traveling in style. ( helicopter whirring ) Thanks. Thank you! Thank you! Ha, ha, ha!!!! Well, welcome to Second Chance Retreat. So, does this get the Forrester's seal of approval? It's so much nicer than I imagined. Big time. It's pretty impressive. Come on, Lucy. Let's go check it out. We'll wait for the second chopper with the bags. Wow, it's so serene. It's so beautiful. Very romantic. I was gonna say relaxing. Welcome to Second Chance Retreat. Good afternoon. Place your hand on the outline, please. Oh, I'm sorry. What's this for? The security ID links to your unique prints and lets you into your room. Basically, it recognizes your bio-signature. I had the same reaction last time I was here. Relax, it's harmless. Really? Mmmhmm. ( Computer ) Bio-scan successful. And now I'll take a picture. Once you check in, the doctor will be around to do a medical. Wait, a medical? I'm fine, thank you. It's just for insurance purposes. They're gonna take a blood sample, check your heartbeat, basically just checking to see if you're alive and breathing. I'll show you to your rooms. Well, perfect. I just need to call the office and make sure there aren't any fires to put out. You're out of luck. Sorry, no phone calls. Retreat policy. We have a cell blocker to prevent any calls. Wait, seriously? We are officially off the grid. It's to help mend the relationship. Great. Trust me, you'll be thanking me in a week. If you say so. The security, is that really necessary? Unfortunately, some of the wives attack their husbands during therapy. It makes for a dangerous environment. ( Laughs ) I'm kidding! I had you! No, it's for the insurance company. They insisted on it, I don't know why. I'll stick with the angry wife scenario. Speaking of angry wives, let's go find them before they spend all your money. Oh, man. This place is awesome. The security? The guards? The blood tests? The doctors? Doesn't it seem a little weird? Can we just get through the week? Look, if you want me to get another room, if you're uncomfortable... They're expecting us for dinner in an hour. We should get ready. I'm willing to make it work. You just have to make an attempt. ( jazz music ) ♪ ♪ Is it just me or is this place completely empty? You read my mind, son. Russell Green, and this is my wife, Ira. Short for irate. Lucy. Hi, Lucy. Greg. Hi, Greg. James. This is my wife, Serena. You're retreat virgins, aren't you? You've got that whole "kicked in the nads" look. I'm sorry, I forgot his muzzle at home. So how did you hear about this place? Oh, well our friends James and Serena, they've been here before, they swear by it. How about you? It's a strange thing. Out of nowhere a woman shows up, tells us we've been selected to participate in a week-long retreat and, well, three words sealed the deal for us: "all expenses paid". And why not? Who would turn down an all expenses paid holiday? I mean, they're looking for the right candidates, and that's Ira and I. Sour, miserable, irritable, old, and ornery. Russ figures if this can change us, it can change anyone. Well, I doubt a week will do the trick. I keep telling her there's no easy trick to saving a marriage. Except for divorce. ( Laughs ) You, come with me. What? I'm sorry, ow! Hey! What the hell are you doing?! She needs to come with me. There, that feeling, defending a loved one. Hold onto it. It means she's someone important to you. Who the hell are you? My name is Alex Koslov. This is my retreat. I know who I am and why I am here. Do you? I'm beginning to wonder. I'm going to give you the means to keep your relationship together. Welcome to Second Chance Retreat. I hope you all enjoy your week. ( Clapping ) Now that's an entrance. Trust me, Greg. He puts on a big show. It's worth the price of admission. Dinner is being served. Please take a seat. I'm starving. You wanted to be here. The meal was fantastic. Thank you. Lucy, it was a stunt. They wanted a reaction out of us and it worked. Granted, he may have taken it a little bit too far. May have taken it too far? He basically attacked me. I stepped in front of you. What else do you want from me? Five seconds of chivalry. Yeah, it must have been a real stretch for you, Greg. Some of you may be having second thoughts. It is understandable. You are afraid of change. You are comfortable with the status quo. You are looking for any excuse to keep things the way they are. If you feel this way, if you are too weak to block out that scared little voice inside your head, then there is the door. Go on. Use it. Good. Again, welcome to Second Chance Retreat. We were expecting a larger group but the weather took a turn for the worse. It looks clear enough outside. True, but not from where we fly from the east. So until the weather changes it will just be us. Is there no other way in? There is a remote road through Edgewater County but it's not exactly user-friendly. But on the bright side it gives us a chance to get to know each other even better. I will get to know you from the inside and out. ( Chuckles ) Abby. Now, if I could ask you to place your identification in the bowl. Uh, what for? Well, it is vital that we shed symbols of our identity before we can possibly work on our relationships. I'm sorry but I'm not comfortable giving my ID to someone I hardly know. Someone you hardly know or someone you don't like? You're the guru, you tell me. I'm in. Me too. Thanks. Well, like Lucy said, you're the guru. So I'm in. We had the same reaction last year. It's all good. It is very nice to see returning couples. It's great to be back. I'm really excited for this week's retreat. As am I. Now tomorrow I would like to start with personal sessions. I will work with each couple individually. I would love to start with Greg and Lucy in the morning. Yeah, great. I can't wait. Excellent. Thank you for a lovely evening. It has been a pleasure, but now I have some business to attend to. You must excuse me. Good night. Greg and Lucy Forrester, married six years, almost seven. Tell me about the life you share. Do you have any children? No. We're basically workaholics. Greg is a history professor. Currently on sabbatical. I'm working on my thesis. And I'm a lawyer. And you know what they say about lawyers. Oh, really? What do they say, Greg? I don't know, I was just joking, Lucy. Any illness? No. What's with the emphasis on our health? I don't see how it's relevant. Well, as you know, disease can put a strain on a relationship. Well, of course, but you already had us medically checked. You know, digging any deeper seems a little personal. After all, I am a lawyer, I know my rights. Lucy. Interesting. I see your defense mechanism. You turn the tables. You do not like to be vulnerable. That's not what I'm doing. That is what you're doing and you do it all the time. I do not. Whatever. I'm sorry. We both have a clean bill of health. It's never been an issue for us. Um, may I ask you about your family history? Tell me about your parents. Uh, my parents died. My father actually died last year. I'm sorry to hear that. Any siblings? No. Lucy? Only child raised by a single mom. She was just diagnosed with dementia a few years back. I'm sorry to hear that. Tell me how you two met. In college. We took the same elective. Astronomy. Yeah. We used to sit on opposite sides of class. We never spoke to each other. Until we booked the same time at the observatory. He loved gazing at the stars. And the rest is history. Tell me about the struggles in your marriage. We all have demons. This is the place to face them. Lucy! Lucy! I'm sorry, I can't do this. Lucy... Doc, I'm so sorry. Lucy! How many times do I have to tell you, nothing else happened between us? Only because I caught you. I saw you kiss her! She kissed me! How many times do I have to tell you that? You didn't seem to mind, did you? I don't know. I needed you, and you checked out. I was there! You were defending your clients. Oh, ok. So I drove you into the arms of another woman? How cliche. No, I told you. She kissed me! And for a second, god help me, I needed it. But if you didn't walk through that alley, I would have pushed her away. We came here to save our marriage. You've just gotta give me one more day. Just give me one more day. I can't go back in there. That's fine. Let's just go for a walk. Ok. Yes, it's me. I just finished the personal interviews with the Forresters. I think we should dig a little deeper. They... they may be hiding something. No, no, no, no. It's... it's no problem, it's just I want to cover all the bases. We've had a 100 percent success rate up until this point. It's getting dark soon so maybe we should head back? Yeah. You know, it's gonna be a little quicker if we go straight back the way we came. Ok, which way would that be? Uh... well, if we head down there, go across the river to that trail, it should lead us back to the retreat. Look, there's a rope. Shouldn't we just go back the way we came? You can't be serious. Why don't we just go back the way we came? No, it'll be fine. I'll just go down and check how deep the river is. I don't think this is a good idea. I'm serious, Luce. It's gonna be fun. ( Branch breaking ) Luce! Yeah? It's safe to cross, the river's only ankle deep. Come on down. I don't think this looks safe. It is. Luce! Are you ok? Someone pushed me! What? I felt it, it felt like someone pushed me! Why would someone push you? I... I don't know! Did you see somebody up there? No. You think I just fell down the hill? I don't know, maybe you tripped. You know... just forget it. Hey. Where've you been? We went on a hike. I think someone tried to push me down a hill. What? I think someone's trying to kill me. Kill you? I know it sounds crazy but I know I saw someone. Who? I don't know. Did you see somebody? I didn't see anything. You can't be sure you saw someone. Maybe a branch snapped and hit you or something. I don't know. Greg! Well, it makes more sense than someone trying to kill you. I know what I saw. But why would someone try to hurt you? I... I don't know! Are you suggesting it's someone from the resort? There you are! We were just about to send out a search party to look for you. Most guests return before dark. Lucy was just telling us that... Oh, we went on a hike and we thought we saw a bear and just got spooked and I just... I tripped and fell. Then you are very lucky. The woods are not a good place after dark. You should stay on the retreat grounds. Now, we are about to dine in a few minutes. Please join me. Great, we're starving. You guys coming? Just give us a minute. Ok. Greg, we need to talk. I know I'm not crazy. It doesn't make any sense. I think someone is trying to kill me, and it could be anyone here! Lucy, we were dehydrated, we were tired, we were hungry. We could have seen Bigfoot in those conditions. But we didn't. Greg, please. I need you to believe me. Ok. We have to tell Koslov. No, no, no. I... I don't think that's a good idea. Why not? Because I don't trust him. I mean, with all this medical crap and the guards, I'm getting a bad feeling about this place. I think we should leave. Leave? Yeah, as soon as we can. So this is what you're after? You're gonna come up with any excuse to get out of here. It's not an excuse, Greg. I'm sorry. Ok, you're gonna believe a conspiracy that someone's trying to kill you? You believe in that more than us. Greg, wait! Have you guys seen Greg? I think he went that way. Lucy! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. Can we talk? Yes, of course. It's just us, Ira. Serena and James told us what happened. I think someone might want to hurt Russ and I, too. What makes you think that? Well, strange things have been happening to us since we got here. I feel like we're being watched. I feel the same way. Russ always insisted we put our valuables, ID, cash, credit cards in a money belt and we never took it off. We only took it off when we went to bed. Wait, you didn't give your ID to Koslov? That's right. Well, I gave him a library card. And we never put anything in the safe. The other day I check my money belt, my ID was gone. My credit cards. Same with Russ's. Did you report it to... Yes, Koslov, of course. That was the first thing we did and he said we should check again just to make sure. Maybe it fell out. He even went back with us to look. And sure enough all our ID was under the bed, like it had just slipped out somehow. But I know it didn't. Someone had to have come in our room and taken it when we were sleeping. For what reason? I don't know. I don't know. Has anything gone missing from your room? Not that I know of, but we use the safe. I just... I just have a terrible feeling about this place. Does Russ feel the same? Yeah, for once we agree on something. Ah, there you are. I was wondering what had happened to you. Now that I have you here, I should let you know that it is not safe to wander away from the retreat, especially at night, and we would not want anything to happen to you. Have a pleasant evening. You don't think he heard, do you? No. Don't worry, everything is gonna be fine. I'm gonna go check on Greg. Ok, I'm gonna go back... go back in there. ( Gasps ) Greg! Greg, wake up! ( Screams ) ( Gasping ) What are you doing? Where are Russ and Ira? We think they left. What? I... I talked to Ira last night, she didn't say anything. Sorry, you'll have to talk to Mr. Koslov. ( Knocking ) Come in. Ah, Mrs. Forrester. What can I do for you? The Greens, where are they? They're probably about an hour from the retreat now. Excuse me? They decided to leave unannounced. We see this sometimes. We should be able to locate them shortly. Something's not right here. Care to share your concerns? Is there something you're not telling me? No. Um... I'm going to go find Greg. Of course. Yes, it's me. Any news? The next group is due to arrive tomorrow and the investors want assurance that there will be no delays. After all, for some people it's a matter of life and death. Any sign of them? I'm afraid not. Maybe they went home. How? It's 15 miles of rough terrain, we'll find them. I want to be part of the search party. Me too. I appreciate your concern, but let's leave this to the professionals. If that's the case then we should call the cops. I mean, they could be hurt, or worse. I mean, you said that there's predators out there. Mrs. Forrester, we have this under control. All the security, the guards... How does someone get away so easily? I've never seen this. I believe her. They went and told Koslov and when they came back, they found their IDs on the floor like they had just fallen out. So someone broke into Russ and Ira's room and stole their IDs? And credit cards while they were sleeping. And then put it back so it didn't raise any alarm bells? When was the last time you checked the safe? Not since we got here. You? I had no reason to. What's the number? Four, one, five, four. Let me try. Four, one, five, four. Four, one, five, four. That's the number I set. It's not working. Well, we both failed, so not much of a coincidence. Ugh. I don't feel so good. Lucy, Lucy. Lucy, Lucy. Wake up. Can you hear me? Lucy! Lucy, wake up! Can you hear me? Breathe, breathe. Take some deep breaths. Deep breaths, that's it. That's... no, no, no, no. Not so fast. Woah, what happened? A leaky gas line fed some carbon monoxide into the room, it's lucky that we found you when we did. A leaky gas line? Yes, being off the grid, we use generators. But not to worry, the problem has been solved for now. The last thing I remember is my wife and I trying to get into our safe. The damn thing kept rejecting us. That is strange. Try it again. It seems to be working fine. Did you find Russ and Ira? No, not yet, but the police are looking into it. I promise to keep you both posted. Um, again I am very sorry for this inconvenience. I have some other things to attend to. Be well. Hey, hon. You ok? Maybe the gas leak wasn't an accident. Why would Koslov want to kill us? He just saved us. Why would he want us dead? I mean, you've seen the security guards, they're always watching, always around. Come on. Seriously. I mean, what if maybe he still needs something from us and once he has it, we... you know what? I'm going to go take a bath and clear my head. Hey, I got a headache. You got any Aspirin? Yeah, there's some in my bag. Did you find them? Yeah, I got them. Hey. Koslov wants us to join him for dinner. Something small and informal. Russ and Ira are still missing. Shouldn't we have a search party? The police are on it. I'm sorry if I seem insensitive, but when we were here a year ago two couples just up and left. One walked the whole way home and then the other just canoed down the river. It's nothing, really. Serena is right, you're overreacting. We're leaving. What? Because of a gas leak? It was an accident. No, that's not the only thing. The safe... Greg. What about the safe? I'll explain later. The point is I want out, Luce wants out. You want out, right? You're making a mistake. No, coming here was a mistake. Buying into your twisted delusion that this couple's retreat is going to save our marriage. Greg. That was a mistake. I'm done making mistakes. I'm sorry, but Serena and I are staying. Our marriage needs this. Yeah, well I'm going home. Wait, Greg! Greg, wait. Greg, I never meant for you to find those papers. I just thought about it one time and... Look, we've gotta stick together to get out of here. After that... Greg, wait. And don't forget to pack this. My wife and I want out now. As far as I'm considered, this is all crap. Relax, Greg. You've made such progress here. No, I'm done relaxing. We want out now, or we're calling the cops. It sounds to me like your wife wants a divorce. You're the one overreacting. How'd you know that? You're not the first one to get the divorce bomb, Greg. The same thing happened to Russ and Ira. Russ left and Ira went after him. She was afraid he would clean out the bank accounts while she was here. I got a message from the police, they found them at home. The neighbours had called because they were yelling and screaming. They're safe. They're safe, already at home? Yes. As I said, they're very wealthy. What Ira wants, Ira gets. She chartered the plane out of here. Greg, the helicopter will be coming later on this afternoon, you're welcome to take it. But I ask you, please, stay until after dinner. If you feel the same way, I will drive you out personally. We can leave tonight? Absolutely. This is not a prison, Greg. Is there anything else I can do for you? I want a room to myself until we leave. Of course. Consider it done. I have an uneasy feeling. I think we should start the transfer right away. I will start the preparations. ( Sobbing ) Yes, I'll marry you. She said yes! ( Laughs excitedly ) I think I realized I want him. Well, it's not too late. We need to convince him to stay. We need to convince him that you are the best thing that's ever happened to him. You're a good friend but I can assure you he does not feel that way. Not now. Well, let's show him what he's about to lose. What are you doing? You are going to look smoking hot tonight. I don't think this is a good idea. ( Knocking ) Koslov? ( On the screen ) Please disable the battery. How unfortunate that the vehicle the Forresters could use has suffered a mechanical malfunction. What the hell? ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Ah, Mr. Forrester. Please, join me. Mr. Forrester. I am so glad you decided to stay. I'm just holding up my end of the bargain. I see the rest of the guests have arrived. Yes, life is good. Please, have a drink. Should I worry? About? What's in the drink? Champagne. Only the best, of course. And where is your wife? She's not really the party type. I see. I see. Well. Well, I beg to differ. She looks beautiful. Wow. May I? Of course. Do you mind? Oh, please. Who are you, and what have you done with Lucy? ( Giggles ) I think Greg's watching. Oh, really? But he's pretending not to. I love this dress on you. Oh, thank you. It's your wife's. I thought I recognized it. Oh, here he comes. Sorry, James. May I talk to my wife? Of course. Pleasure. Thank you for the dance. What's going on? Koslov. He's playing us. I saw them sabotage the Jeep so it won't start. Why would he do that? I told him that we were leaving tonight otherwise I would call the cops. He has no intention of driving us back. I have a feeling if we stick around... Maybe we'll have an accident? Exactly. We've gotta get out of here. How? I'm going to steal us a Jeep. Seriously. I see you have been calming the storm. Discord is never a good thing. It's all going to be over in a few days. Satisfaction once again. ♪ ♪ Meet me at the back of the lodge in five minutes. Oh, I don't think so. You're not going anywhere without me and I'm not taking no for an answer. Well, if we're going to do this we need to step away without anyone noticing. Ok, so we need a diversion. What? Spin me. ( Glasses smash ) That's great, now we need to change. I'm so sorry. I'll be right back. I knew it! Nice diversion, well played. Thanks. It was actually pretty fun. Ok, keep an eye out. Ok. ( Whispers ) Greg, get down! Hey, Luce. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. That's ok. What are you doing out here? Just taking a breather. Just giving Greg some space to cool off. Oh, I didn't mean to pry. How did you find me out here? Did you follow me? I was just getting some air. I smelled your perfume. I recognized it from the dance. Oh yeah, um, sorry about Serena's dress. Don't worry about it. Well, I'm going to head back in. Do you want to join me? I'm just gonna be out here for a few minutes. Alright, see you. You ok? Yeah, it was just James. How much longer? Ok. Just give me a minute. Keep an eye out. Ok. ( Whispers ) Greg, get down! Get down! I'm going to confirm the buyer right now. I'll be right back. ( Whispers ) Luce! Luce!! ( door slams shut ) ( Radio ) Charlie, I need you in sector four. Yeah, I'm on my way. You sick bastard. You've been watching us the whole time. Come on! Come on!! What are you up to, Koslov? ( Screams ) ( Gasps ) ( screams ) Get out of the Jeep. Easy. Now! Greg! Come on! Stop! He will shoot you. Don't hurt her. You know, Greg, you're beginning to get on my nerves. I think it is time you met the surgeon. ( Groans ) Greg! Greg! Greg, wake up! Greg, wake up, please! Greg! Greg! Please, wake up! Greg! We've gotta get out of here! Russ and Ira, they're dead! What? They butchered them! They're in the other room! That room is filled with bodies! We have to get out of here! Koslov is a psycho! We have... we have to warn Serena and James! Please, hurry! Please! Ok, ok. Please, please. Hurry! Hurry, Greg, hurry! Someone's coming, do you trust me? Yes. Ok. Easy, easy. You do not want to stress the organs. Who do you think you are? Well, here my name is Mr. Koslov. But back home I'm known as Vassily Bolkin, a highly skilled surgeon who, because of an unfortunate accident, was stripped of my medical license. I struggled and I scraped for two years until a very fortunate circumstance allowed me to save the life of a man who had been shot. This man had a very lucrative business collecting identities and then making the victims disappear. I convinced him that there was value in the bodies, more profit to be made. Use them as organ donation. So you just butchered all those people? Russ and Ira? Well, I'm a surgeon, again. Only now I take a life to give a life. Hey! ( Screaming ) Help! Somebody help! No one can hear you scream. Leave my wife alone! First, your wife is going to die, and then you are going to cease to exist. ( Screaming ) Help! Somebody, please! Woah, woah. Shut up. Doc, I told you to sedate her. You two are involved in this, too? Yeah. I can't believe it. You're monsters. I prefer to be called an opportunists. Who'd have thought an accountant would have a gun? ( James) Such a nice gun, sneaky little prick. ( Gun shot ) Next thing you know he's shooting at us. ( Serena ) Fortunate for us he was a bad shot. ( James ) We wanted to take him alive. This man had access to a lot of money. But now we couldn't leave a witness behind. He had to go. ( Serena ) James was hurt. We had to find a doctor who could keep his mouth shut. ( James ) We found him. And lucky for us, we had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Koslov. He patched me up. The man was brilliant. ( Serena ) It's not often you meet someone special, who can take an unfortunate situation and turn it into a money making operation. We went from stealing identities to harvesting and selling body parts as well. Do you know how much a kidney sells for on the black market? A heart is 300,000, 400,000. More than you're worth alive. And definitely more than what either of you would make in a year. I thought we were friends. Wow. ( Laughs ) Look where that got you. Presumption leads to disappointment. Didn't anyone ever teach you that? Anyways, it doesn't matter. It's all going to be over soon, you two will no longer exist. Well, your heart, your liver, your kidneys and your lungs might. How long have you been playing us for? Six months. We accessed your medical history, your business information, you're wonderful candidates for the program, and in desperate need of some counseling. We got close. Watched you, frequented the same haunts. Befriended you. Don't give me that look. It's a compliment, really. Baby, what's that phrase again? Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. You won't get away with this. Seriously? ( Laughs ) Come on, you're tied up. Where are you going to go? We're doing you a favour, really. I mean, thanks to us, you two are gonna give someone a great gift. That's true. It's time to make the final arrangements with the buyer, collect our money. Vassily, love your work. I want her eyes. Good luck with the surgery. Don't have too much fun, either. We have other guests to tend to. They're good colleagues. They make me a very wealthy man. Someone is going to find out what you're doing and stop you. What, like you two? They'll wind up on my table in the end. Shall we begin? Hey! Get away from her! I'm doing her a kindness. Let her go! We do not want to stress the organs any more than we have to. Would you prefer I did this without anesthetic? Otherwise you'll be awake the whole time! Get away from her!!!!!! ( Groans ) No! ( Struggle ensues ) Greg! ( Groans in pain ) Greg! Greg! ( struggle ensues ) Greg, Greg, Greg!!! Get me out! Ok, we gotta go. Luce, what are you doing? We have to go! Just hold on one second. I got it. Let's go! Go, go, go! Greg, Greg, Greg! Wait, look at this. We have to stop them. We can't let them get away with this. There could be fifty IDs here! We've gotta take this for evidence. Greg. We can do this. We stay, we die. We're gonna get out. Ok. Come on. ♪ ♪ What do you see? A bunch of losers. Wrong. Money. Lots and lots of money. Let's go check our bids. Enjoy. Wait, wait! They're coming! They're coming! Just give me a minute. ( Whispering ) Wait Greg!! Greg! Greg! No, no, no, no!! No, no, no! They've got my computer! Where are they? There! ( car engine attempting to start ) Hey! They're coming!!! Let's go, go, go, go! Serena, come on! Dammit! They're getting away! Come on! ( Gun shot ) ( Gun shot ) Hurry! Greg, hurry! We lost them. What are you doing? You just let them get away. Shut up! This is why I have insurance. What about Koslov? You get sloppy, you get burned. What about our new recruits? Put them on ice until we find a replacement for Koslov. And when will that be? We have some fun. They just took off with our laptop. We are dead. I have it covered, Serena. Let's get back to the house and clean up the mess. I knew we should have killed them when we had the chance. ( Slap ) Don't ever tell me what I should do. Do you understand me? Do you understand me? Yes. Let's go! Ok, we're safe. Call the police. There's no service. And they may be able to track the cell phone. We should probably just lay low and go to the police in the morning. Yeah, I think you are right. That's a good idea. Ladies and gentlemen, there's been a change of plans. I need you to come with me now. Now! ( Gun shot ) There we go! Come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Eat my food, drink my booze, and you don't want to listen to me? Let's go! Luce. We gotta go. Are we gonna be ok? We made it this far so I doubt they're gonna find us. No, I mean us. Yeah. Yeah, we're gonna be ok. Your hair's just... there. What are you doing? I have an idea. ( Phone ringing ) Troy? Mrs. Forrester. I see the aliens haven't gotten to you yet. Just call me Lucy. Troy, listen. I need to ask you a huge favour. I can't pay you. No, no. It's not that. It's something that I've told you not to do a thousand times. I'm listening. It could be dangerous and it's completely illegal. I'm in. ( Lucy ) Ok, now listen, are you able to track the cell phone? ( Troy ) Come on, that's child's play. Give me something harder than that. ( Lucy ) We were being held in a resort about an hour from where we are now. Can you find that spot? ( Troy ) No problem. I'll access the previous cell calls, triangulate location from cell towers and voila busted. ( Lucy ) I need you to hack into their security system. ( Troy ) Now, we're talking. ( Lucy ) Once you're in, this is what I need you to do... Hearts, kidneys, you name it. That's just what they told us. Who knows what else they do. All we know is that they're stealing people's identities and they're selling their organs until there's nothing left. And who knows how many victims there's already been? And there's gonna be more victims if we don't stop them. They have more recruits flying in today. Please, Sheriff. I know it sounds far-fetched, but you've gotta believe us. Ok. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna have the SWAT team move in, hold the camp, secure the suspects. I need the two of you to come back with me and ID them. Oh gosh. Hold on. You want us to go back? Time is not on our side here, Mrs. Forrester. Now you've made some very serious accusations. I need you to trust me on this one. Ok. Ok, let's move. How long do we keep them here? As long as they're valuable, whatever it takes. ( Phone rings ) Yeah? Good. What? Problem solved. This is getting messy. I don't feel good about this. I think we should just cut our losses and head... Stop talking! I told you, I have all angles covered. I don't understand. This place was so heavily guarded. Where is everyone? Are we safe? They have guns. We could be walking into an ambush. Everything is under control. I had the SWAT team move in, they've secured the area, if everything you've told me is true it should all be over very soon. SWAT team. This is SWAT, report. Alright, you guys hang tight. I'm going to move inside, make sure everything is under control. Something's not right here. I don't see a SWAT team anywhere. They've gotta be around the front. Let's go. Don't look at me, move. Are these the suspects? That's them. That's far enough. You're going to pay for what you did. Did you actually think you were gonna get away with it? They killed Russ and Ira and many others. We have proof. Good. Why don't you show me where that proof is, we'll get them back to the station for processing. It's over here. Just one of you. One of us? Why? What's going on here? You're in on this? The incentive was too good to pass. Money talks. Now that you're back, let's finish what we started. Move! Once we give you the evidence you're gonna kill us anyways. Maybe. Maybe not. But I've got a guarantee. If you don't get the evidence right now, I'm going to shoot your wife. Why are you doing this? Really, Luce? For the money. Faster. James gets a little trigger happy sometimes. If he lays one finger on my wife... Shut up and keep moving! It's over here. Go. Is that everything? Yeah. Ok, move. Move. Finally. You two really don't want to kill us. Why's that? Because you're being watched. ( Laughs ) We're 30 miles away from anywhere. It's pathetic. ( Phone rings ) Woah, woah. Hands up. It's for you. Really? No, really. It's for you. In my back pocket. ( phone ringing ) She's telling the truth. I called the Feds, they're on their way. Take a look at your security cameras. I've hooked into your security system. Your every move is being watched and recorded. You listen to me. You've got ten seconds to delete the footage, or Lucy here will no longer be a viable organ donor! You got it? She's gonna be dead! Can't do. It is a live stream. In addition to having the footage streamed to a proxy server, it is being broadcast across the nation. We knew a few pictures weren't going to be enough. We needed more. You two are on your own. This is above my pay grade. What? Moralis! I'm out of here. I haven't killed anyone yet, I don't plan on starting now. I'll take my chances with the Feds. Moralis! ( Gun shot ) Aaargh! I liked him! Watch both of them. Give me that. You better not have deleted anything. ( Struggle ensues ) ( Gun shots ) ( Fight continues ) ( gunshots ) ( Fight continues ) Serena! Serena, where the hell are you going?! ( Fight continues ) ( Fight continues ) You bastard. No! You ruined everything! You're a monster! You killed Russ and Ira! Come on. Come at me. You shouldn't have followed me here. ( Groans ) And let you get away with this? You're so weak. ( Cries out in pain ) Ow! Too easy. I'm really gonna enjoy this. ( fighting grunts ) ( Cries out in pain ) Take a breath. Take a breath. ( Laughs ) You don't stand a chance. I should have killed you days ago. Time to say good-bye. You've been played. You've been nothing but a pain. You and that wife, blah, blah, blah. Well, guess what, buddy? It's time for a divorce. Come here. ( Screams in pain ) Yes! Get him, Greg! Oh, god! ( Groans ) No. Greg! Greg! Greg! Come here! No. ( Sobbing ) Luce... No, no, no, no, no. Don't talk. Don't talk. Help is coming. This isn't over. See you soon. Good luck with that. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Now this is a vacation. It's perfect. You know, it was all my fault. What was? Our marriage falling apart. I could have told you how I was feeling. Expressed myself better. Instead I just made you read my mind. It took me getting stabbed to figure it out what a jerk I was. I played my part, as well. I know you were hurting and I just lost track of what was important in my life. I think we both did. Well, we're here now. And I wouldn't change that at all. Except for no more retreats. Done. I love you so much. I love you, too.
