What does a man lion do if he sees a woman lion come into his jungle? - They rub noses. -That's right, sergeant, they rub noses. And what do we do? We are frustrated, we don't rub noses. And do you know why. sergeant? Because we are civilized. We don't exercise our instincts anymore. That's light. More exercise is what we need. When woman meets man today. what does she do? - She don't rub noses. - No. But out of he! subconscious primeval background-- Ain't words wonderful? --It doesn't matter whether the man is handsome or dances well... ...she knows he's he! man when she sees him. Because she's still got he! animal instinct way down deep inside her. Fascinating. Sergeant, since you're wearing a South Pacific ribbon there... ...you might inject a little color of the tropics into your line too. Like what?

MAN: Thank you very much 10! the dance. - Thank you. In the far stretches of the South Pacific. beneath the gleam of a tropical moon... ...I dreamt of this moment. OI am I being too bold? If you'll excuse me, I hate goodbyes. Look, I'm the white sheep of my family. Let's go someplace where we can talk? We hostesses are not permitted to leave with the servicemen. And besides. I have to be at the studio quite early. My life to this moment has been a total loss... ...because I ain't seen your beautiful puss in pictures. Well. I work at the studios. I wouldn't tum down an invitation to come to watch you work tomorrow. Oh, I'm so sorry, but you see, I give so much of myself to my art... ...there'd be so little left for you. A crumb would be a banquet. And besides. I'll be all tied up with Humphrey Bogart all day. We're testing. You passed my test the moment I laid my orbs on you. Would you settle 10! a dance? Would a starving man settle for a beefsteak? I like these novelty bands that play music the way it was written. Now. isn't there something about me that makes me stand out tlom these other guys? Well. yes. now that you mention it. Well. what is it? Gee. I don't know. all a girl's got to go by is he! instinct. That's ii, you got it! You're subconsciously primeval! [MEN LAUGHING] NOLAN: Luscious! Good night, sergeant. I have to save myself for my art, you know. I have to report in San Francisco Monday. I'd certainly like another... ...look at Miss Leslie before I go. -I'll keep my fingers crossed for you. SLIM: What's the matter, pal? -l'rrl off women for the duration. Isn't that an unfortunate attitude to have at the Hollywood Canteen? Happens to be the way I feel. ma'am. Look. this is the last dance tonight. Shall we have it together? Okay- What's the kitten's name? We've tried very hard to find a name 10! it. Have you any suggestions? How about... Yes? Anybody ever tell you you look like Joan Crawford? Well. yes. my husband has. - You dance good, light as a feather. -Thank you. - You're a dead-ringer for Joan Crawford. -Arn I really? Don't look now, but I am Joan Crawford. You're-- - Joan Claw“? - Yes. Oh. somebody get some water. Quick. he's fainted. Joan Crawford . [PEOPLE LAUGHING] You know. Slim... ...when we was mildewing in the jungle. I kind of resented these canteens... ...and the guys who were lucky enough to be here instead of there. I won't resent it no more. And I used to figure that Hollywood was a place with all false fronts. Nothing false about them we seen tonight. Gorgeous. Yeah. she certainly is. You know, I don't wanna get sloppy about this but it kind of got me. All them famous people being friendly and democratic. Democratic. Democracy. That's what it means. Slim. Everybody equal, like tonight. All them big shots listening to little shots like me... ...and being friendly. - Slim. - What's the matter? - I danced tonight! -Quiet! No. look! I don't need my cane no more! Hey, hey. look! Listen. you guys! [MEN GROANING] Look. I got lid of my extra leg! Look. will you! [SINGING] I left my cane At the Hollywood Canteen I left my-- MAN 1: Quiet. MAN 2: Go to sleep. NOLAN: I didn't even miss it! MAN 3: Quiet. That's wonderful, sarge, wonderful. It was that dame with the instinct that did it. Something subconsciously primeval passed on betwixt us and I forgot my cane. Why didn't you tell me. Slim? I was thinking about something else. I guess. I didn't notice. There's nothing like a leg of your own to stand on. Oh. that bread. I could hire out just to stand here and drool. SLIM: It sure smells good. Good old American ?owers. - They sure top them jungle orchids. - I'll say. May I serve you? No. ma'am. I'm just smelling. Miss. have you got any of them flowers what eats ?ies? WOMAN: You think that'd be appropriate to send to your girlfriend? I don't send my girlfriends no ?owers. I always say a good smack on the kisser pays off more. Sell my pal a daisy. He wants to know whether he and his dream gill... -...was meant 10! each other. - One on the house. - Thanks a lot. Oh. fine. - See? NOLAN: Say, look, that sign says passion fruit. I didn't know it came that way. What do you get for passion fruit? - As fruit or as juice? - You mean. you can take it like juice? Well, most people do. A dollar a bottle. Slim. give me one of my dollars. this I gotta try. NOLAN: Hey, look, your girlfriend. SLIM: Miss Leslie? Oh. hello. are you shopping too? No. ma'am. we're just looking. You remember me? Well. of course I do. you're Slim. - I kissed you at the Canteen. - I know. L-- I-- I just want you to know that kiss. It didn't put you under any obligations. Oh. I understand. But it sure was beautiful while it lasted. - I'm glad you liked it. - I sure did. Miss Leslie. I'd like you to meet Sergeant Nolan. - How do you do. sergeant? Greetings. Do you want me to carry your vegetables to the car? No. thanks. they're not very heavy. Well, it-- It's wonderful seeing you again. Thanks. It's nice seeing you again too. Slim. - Well. goodbye. - Bye. Oh. you Romeo. You chicken-hearted Bo Peep. “It was so beautiful while it lasted.“ Why didn't you get in there and pitch? She said it was nice seeing me again. Give me my bottle of passion-huh juice. Here. Johnny! Number 999.822 just came through the door. - Won't belong now. I gotta go back. - Okay. All light. sit down. everybody. sit down. Sit down. that's the idea. Now, you fellows in the back, sit down, will you, please? Thanks. You know. this is the biggest night in the history of the Canteen so tar. Around here we don't celebrate anniversaries in terms of months or years... ...but in terms of how many of you we've welcomed into this place. Alan Hale just told me a number. 999.822. That means the millionth soldier or sailor or Marine... ...is gonna walk through that entrance and we wanna celebrate it. While we're waiting. I'd like to give a quick run-through of how this place was born. Bette Davis and the lest of us thought it'd be a good idea... ...if we found a place where we could say. “Welcome to Hollywood," and. "Thanks.“ This is the place we found. At first, it looked like a kind of an abandoned dump... ...so we sent a circular around to all the movie folks... ...and asked them to pitch in and help. All the movie unions in town said, "Okay. we're with you 100 percent." First came the janitors. ...then came the carpenters, an Sundays and holidays... ...and then the electrician fixed the wiring. Meanwhile, the set designers laid out blueprints and plans. Then the painters came with their buckets and brushes and made the place like new. And the studio artists painted the murals you see. The signs came from the sign painters. The trucking companies sent us trucks, and folks chipped in on chairs and furniture. The musicians' union started lining up the music. The planning committee had to keep way ahead. Actresses, gatemen, cameraman, stenographers. directors... ...the whole motion-picture industry pitched in to help. The girls from the studios volunteered to be junior hostesses. They're not only actresses and secretaries and script girls. they're grand kids. I can't finish this story without bringing to the mike... ...the lady who worked harder than anybody to bring this Canteen into being. Our first president and still our president. Get Bette Davis. - Front and center. -I have to go. What? What is it? Did the millionth man come? - This is all 10! you. - Well. what about? Come on and say thanks. I don't know what Johnny could have said to bring forth this very warm greeting... ...but whatever it was, I'm perfectly sure I don't deserve it. - Tonight is a big night here. - I've already said that. Have you? What number's coming through? What number is it, Alan? Nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand. nine hundred and eighty-nine. MAN: Nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand. nine hundred and eighty-nine. JOHN: Will you make an aisle. fellas? Just make an aisle so he can get through. That's right, busboys, will you give us a hand? That's the idea. I see the millionth man. a sailor. But these two babes from Lockheed said they'd be at the Palladium hot or cold. I know. Joe. but... Come on. Weenie. All light. so they don't show up. we can come back. What do you got to lose? Ale you sure my chick': good-looking? Redheaded. Okay. the Palladium it is. Like you say. what have we got to lose? You'll be very sorry. And you'll be very happy. Allow me to be the first to congratulate you, soldier, and just step this way. He's the millionth man. Folks. the millionth man! [BAND PLAYING FANFAHE] It's Slim. - Johnny. you arranged this. - I swear it's on the level. Gills. he's all yours. - Hello. - Hello. - I've kissed you before. -That's right. You didn't know you were somebody special. did you? No. ma'am. Am I? Yes. you're the millionth man to enter the Hollywood Canteen. Gee. that's“ Thai': a lot of men. It is. and that's why we wanted to do something about it. So we decided to let the man who was actually number 1 million... ...celebrate for all the rest, as an expression of our gratitude... ...to the men who have already come to the Canteen. And to those we hope will continue to come until the war is over. The studios and the merchants of Hollywood have contributed gifts... ...as a symbol of their appreciation. And as the official representative of our first million men... ...Corporal Green, they're all for you. There's a hotel suite reserved for you... ...there's a car waiting at the back door for you... ...there's an evening at any nightclub in town... ...and every studio has cordially invited you to visit them. And last. but I don't think least... ...you may choose any actress in town as your date to! the weekend. [MEN WHISTLING AND CHEERING] Golly. The millionth man's first words were. “Golly.“ Did you mean I could have a date with Joan Leslie? BETTE: What do you say. Joan? I'm flattered and honored to be chosen. Slim. I'll try to show you a good time. L-- Golly. L-- I-- I can't believe it all. We'll have your gifts sent over to the hotel, Slim. I have a buddy out here. Could he bunk in with me? - Of course, what's his name? -Sergeant Nolan. He's out here someplace. Would the corporal's buddy please come up to the stage? Me! [BAND PLAYING] - That's nice going. fella. - Thank you. Congratulations. Slim. - Thanks. Gee. all these congratulations. It's just like a wedding. Just like a wedding. How'd you do in your test with Humphrey Bogart, beautiful? Oh, they're crazy about me. Mr. Bogart said he never got so much give from anybody. What's “give“? Well. it's how you look at someone... ...when somebody says something to somebody about something. I know what you mean. You got more give than I ever got. - You're gonna be a star? -Oh, I guess so. They want me 10! a seven-year contract. I'm only going to give them five. - They're very upset. -I know how they feel. Wanting seven and only getting five. I know just how they feel. Joanie. how about singing a chorus with the band? - All light. Jimmy. Do you mind? - I'd love it.

Oh, I am sorry about that, but really if you had only spoken up-- Well, I wouldn't worry about it... ...because I have other numbers up my sleeve too. brothel. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Hm. But, Mr. Szigeti, I was just thinking, instead of playing a violin solo... ...it might be a lather good idea if we played a duet together. Why. that could be lather amusing. Is there anything in particular you would care to suggest? Oh. I don't care. you suggest something. anything. It really makes no difference. How about: “The Introduction and Rondo Capliccioso“ by Saint-Saéns? Oh. the “Ca-- The Capliccio“ Oso.“ Yes, I could take the “introduction“... ...and you do the “Capliccioso.“ Oh. I would do the “Capliccio-J'? Yes. yes. yes. Well. you see... ...that number never seemed to get anywhere. I mean. people don't hum it. How would you like to play--? I have a suggestion. How would you like to play. “Love in Bloomioso“? -“ Bloomioso“ ? - Yes. Well. I don't think I've ever heard that one. He's supposed to be the world's greatest violinist.

I've already picked him. but he knows none of us gills... ...can make dates for when we leave, so he's safe. I did so want to go up to Hollywoodland and discuss scientific things with him. - Whele's Hollywoodland? - Oh. up on top of everything. sergeant. What of a scientific nature is there up there? Well. that all depends on who's being scientific about what. Well. I see. yes. Suppose a fellow had an interest in things subconsciously primeval... -...and he was up there? - He'd have to take a taxi to get there first. Suppose he took a taxi? He wouldn't know where to tell the taxi drivel to go. would he? What's the pool guy gonna do? Well. I suppose all he can do. since it's 9:00... ...is to go to the comer of Sunset and Cahuenga Boulevard and get in a cab there. And then what? Well. if he waits long enough... ...maybe somebody will come along and snuggle light in beside him... ...and tell the drivel where to go. What it there's nobody nice enough to do all that? I think there will be. Yes. but how can you tell. old gill? Well. it's merely a matter of instinct. old boy. [NOLAN HUMS] And a little science helps sometimes. Well, end of my shift, bye. Miss me. Charming people, quite odd. I haven't the vaguest idea... ...what they were talking about, have you? - No. - No. ANNOUNCER: Fellas. here he is. Carmen Cavallalo. Thank you very much.

[ROSARIO SPEAKS IN SPANISH] - Hey! - Hey! - Hey! - Hey! Tonight we have a very distinguished visitor. Our millionth man. Corporal Slim Green. He told me that last night when he was chosen. he was too startled to speak. Now he's found his voice and he'd like to say something. So. gentlemen. your Iepleseniative. Corporal Slim Green. Fellas. I guess any of you who were here last night and saw... ...how I was lucky enough to be number 1 million were kind of ashamed of me. All I said was “Golly.“ [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I know I let you down. That's why I wanted to come back up here before I shove off tonight. I happened to be number 1 million... ...but I just represent every fella who's ever come here. I might have been a soldier, a flier, a sailor of the British Commonwealth of Nations... ...or a Chinese air cadet, here to learn to fly. I might have been one of our friends from Russia... ...of one of our own colored boys. I might have come from the Philippines across the Pacific... ...or from down under, from New Zealand or Australia. OI maybe been a Flee Frenchman. I might have been one of the boys from South America. Or from our next-door neighbor Mexico. Or maybe escaped from Norway or the Netherlands or Denmark... ...of Greece or Poland or Czechoslovakia or any of the countries. I might have been wearing kilts like a Scotsman... ...but believe me. if I was. you could see my knees shaking light now. So I was all of you fellas rolled up into one when they made this short leave... ...in Hollywood into some kind of paradise 10! me. We've seen people we've dreamed of. up close. And we've found them all as real as they are famous. They wait on us. they wash our dishes. Gosh. they come up here every night to make us laugh or even choke up a little. But whatever they do, they make us forget for a while... ...where we've been or where we're going. Still. I think we'll remember longest. that most us arrived here lonely. But after corning to the Canteen, we weren't lonely anymore. So. Miss Davis, when I just said. “Golly.“ last night... ...I was feeling as grateful as all the boys are. Except that we can't put it into words. So instead of saying. "Thanks." we just say. "Golly." and never forget. Thank you. Slim. You've given us something we'll never forget. And wherever you go. our hearts go with you. Thank you. Come on. Slim. we'll miss our train. You and the guys run along. I'll meet you there. I've got a lilt. Famous last words. Slim.
