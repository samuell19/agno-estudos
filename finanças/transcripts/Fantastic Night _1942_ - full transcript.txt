What, were you asleep? I'm sorry. You've got your system down: Let the others work while you sleep. Bravo! I didn't mean to. It just came over me. Oh, yeah? You're just lazy. You heard me! Honest. I couldn't help it. You heard me! Here, give me a hand. - You're so delicate. - I'm terribly sorry. How you talk. If you weren't so nice-looking-- You should find some way to relax. Don't yawn. I can't take it. I don't get enough sleep. - So saw some logs during the day. - I work in the afternoon too. - Don't. They're mine. - Take them, then. Come on, let's get to it! Come on. Give me a hand. I don't know how to thank you. You're very kind. How you talk. Like a dictionary. What's your real work? Now you've got me doing it. Give me a cigarette! And a light. There's the bell. Keep it. See you tonight. Hello, my friend. You're early this morning, Denis. Going to the wedding? Not too tired? I'll reminisce about the youth I never had. What a shame. Youth-- I'd trade my shop for it. How about trading me a cup of coffee instead? Don't mind me, Boris. Denis! Put that money back. Where you got it. Lock the drawer. Give me the key. Close the wardrobe door too. The key. Denis, I'm sorry. I'm a miserable sinner... a pitiful wretch. Be quiet, Boris. Despise me, Denis. Please, despise me. For my sake! Get up! I shall stay at your feet till I die. I will get up only to die. That's great. Come on, get up! As you wish. I'll be punished for it, but I'll obey. Pretty flowers. Don't touch! They're fragile. So last month it was you too? Yes, I stole your rent money, your pajamas, shoes, ties... and electric iron. Spit in my face! For two weeks I've been killing myself... working all night at the market. I've no excuse. I'm a dirty dog! I know you're killing yourself to pay room and board till exams. If you flunk, it will be my fault. Bring me a vase for these flowers. Right away. - Boris! - Nina! What are you doing here? I have a modeling session. I stopped by to see if Denis was feeling better. Don't go see him. You look upset. Poor chap. Why? Does he know about-- No, he doesn't know about us. Then what's wrong? Are you having second thoughts? No, but I feel guilty. Is it eating you? To deceive a friend-- How shameful! And just how should I feel? I'm his girlfriend! They're all the same. Women troubles. Makes me wonder. Women! It's all in your head. You're right-- I am a wretch. I preferred your shame to my death. At least I have a conscience. My conscience bothers me, so I've done my penance. How convenient. You know how to deal with everyone-- your conscience, your landlord-- everybody! - Remember what you owe me. - Sure, sure. - How is he? - Who? Your victim. Sure-- Denis. He's sleeping. You were wrong to cheat on him. He deserved better. A guy who's always tired ought to rest. Put yourself in my place. He's always sleeping: standing up, lying down-- While I count the tiles in the floor! He pays no attention to me. Even when he kisses me, he's thinking of something else... just as if I wasn't there. If he weren't so shy, I'd think he was cheating on me too. But he's not even doing that! So it's his tough luck if we-- Sure. Forget that wet blanket. Pick me up at the clinic at 7:00. Don't kiss me like that. It makes me dizzy. If you want to sleep, why don't you go to bed? I wasn't sleeping, Lucien. Really? I was dreaming. What's the difference? There's a huge difference, my dear doctor. If I slept, I'd wake up rested, but I'm exhausted. You're having dreams? Must be your liver. I'm really tired! You look worn out. I haven't slept in 24 hours. My essay on Marguerite of Navarre has to be finished tonight. And I've still got all this to do! You're really not doing well. You've got a fever. It's got nothing to do with a fever. Listen to me, Lucien. For three weeks now, every time I doze off... I have the exact same dream... in which an amazingly beautiful woman floats by. She appears, only to run away from me. I follow her white silhouette... through amazing landscapes. But she always escapes from me with impish skill. She becomes a starfish, a rainbow... a light, a laugh, a bunch of flowers. Stay still! Don't touch that! What's gotten into you? Lie down! You'll feel better. It won't make any difference-- I'm fine. Nothing strange in what ails you. Everyone has a favorite dream. Favorite dream? But I didn't choose this one. It chose me. The job is not very difficult. But it is very risky. Perhaps, but it's very well paid. You're an intelligent woman. Asleep, I pursue my dream. Awake, it pursues me. It's a kind of obsession. - Who will cure me? - You yourself. - I'd like to know how. - Nina can help you. Don't talk to me about her. She's so sweet, so loving... - and I'm unfaithful to her. - You are? Of course-- in my dream! See you later. To have a dream spoil one's life! How ironic! Don't tell me you're in love with this illusion. - I am. - What about Nina? She doesn't know about it yet. I'll tell her the truth. You can't. You have no willpower when it comes to women. You're right, and it causes me enough grief already. I'd like to be cured of it. - But I must tell Nina the truth. - What truth? That I love someone else and we must break up. You're leaving Nina for this dream woman? But I can't have two sweethearts. But one of them doesn't exist! She exists because I love her. There you are! May I intrude? By all means. - Thank you. - Listen-- One slap, coming up! What's wrong? For a week now you haven't even known I exist. My charms aren't meant to be wasted. - This is the ultimate insult! - What do you mean, ultimate? I call ignoring me the ultimate insult. That's how I see it! - Nina, be nice. - That's all I've done, is be nice. Tell him you're sorry. Never mind. It's nothing. What? It's nothing? - Don't start again! - But she's right. - See? I'm right. - Yes, Nina's right. You should know the whole truth. Nina, you and I-- That is-- - You explain it to her. - Explain what? That she needn't feel humiliated... that I love someone else. What are you talking about? He's going to explain. You love someone else? Who is she? This changes everything. I'll tell her a thing or two. But you can't. Can't I? Why not? - Because she doesn't exist. - You take me for an idiot? No, Nina. She doesn't exist. She's the reason I sleep so much. - What? - It's true. - What's this woman like? - I don't know. - Brunette? Blonde? Redhead? - I don't know. Tall? Short? What does she look like? - I've never seen her. - You've never seen her. Hey, Adelbert! You prefer a shadow to me-- I who never hid a thing from you. The man's in love with a question mark! - You won't see this woman again! - Is that so? - I'll keep you from seeing her. - How? I won't let you sleep. - How about roast beef? - That's fine. I'll lock myself in. I want to sleep! I'll get into your dream. You can't just waltz into my dreams. It's not a free show! We'll see about that! You can't compete with a shadow! Shadow, my foot. I'll show her a shadow! - Take it easy. - I am taking it easy! Still water. That's me! But watch out when still water starts to boil! That child has some colorful expressions! Lucien, can you lend me a quarter? Better than that-- come and have dinner with us. Since my presence seems to be so sought after... I'll have roast beef. I've followed your little exchange with great interest. I, too, have loved imaginary women. They are my fondest memory. And now that I'm blind... I must use my imagination for even the most real of women. It's not bad. I get to imagine them as I like. Let me have a cigarette. Where did I put them? Right-hand pocket of your jacket. He's right! It was in losing my sight that I became a seer. Very strange. If you should ever have need of my special talents... I live at 13 Lovers' Lane. Funny. And here I thought you slept out under the stars. No, no, the building belongs to me. I made myself a present of it. Just a whim. Did you hear that? I'm talking to you! Where have you gone? - Off with your shadow again? - Calm down. You don't want me to get near your specter, huh? - What's wrong with you? - Nothing! Phantom or not, I'll take care of her. Hate to break up your charming romance, but you'll be late for the market. I'm on my way. They're all crazy about me there. Stop chatting. Go find your buddies. You get here just in time to take a break. Come have a drink. No, thanks. Well, I better get going. What's wrong with him? He's never thirsty. You ought to see a doctor. Look at him. He always gets here late and wants to chat on top of it. Mademoiselle, please. Let me see your face. Now that I've seen your face, don't take it away. You'll come with me to the end of my dream? It's not far. At the break of day. Irene. You're always late. You're desirable enough as it is-- no need to keep us waiting. You? Sit down. Here. Our last-minute guest. Don't be embarrassed by your clothes. They're in their working clothes too. Dear Lord, don't let me wake up. Don't let me wake up! Three dozen oysters and another bottle. You'll have something with us, won't you, sir? Nothing, thanks. I'm just a bit thirsty. A glass for the gentleman. Where were you at this late hour? It's not proper. Don't ask me questions-- I won't answer. What's the matter? You should be happy. This is the last evening you'll spend with your fianc?... because tomorrow he'll no longer be your fianc?... but your husband. The end of my life as a young girl, and you want me to be happy? Look. They're happy too. My daughter must seem a bit strange. I'm a stranger... an unknown person... an enigma... and this pitiful cadet whose wife I will be doesn't know me at all! You exaggerate. He only knows my face, the poor thing. He's marrying my appearance. I'll wear black at my wedding. Irene... you're upsetting me. Black, I tell you. I'll be mourning my stillborn springtimes. Farewell, lilies of the valley. Mademoiselle is dead. Long live Madam. But will I get married? It takes two to get married. That's right: two. And this poor cadet is alone. Alone. Sad wives... make joyous widows. What did you give her to drink? Me? Why, nothing! Where did you meet her? In my dream, just like you. How long have you known her? My dear white silhouette... he asks how long I've known you. Do you see one another often? Every time I close my eyes. Very strange. I've spent every night with her for the past month. - What? - You heard me. I finally meet her, only to learn she's to marry a cardboard cutout. You've been drinking, sir! Yes, sir! To your health, by God's grace. Mademoiselle? Yes, you! Don't keep me waiting, miss. Pretty girl, isn't she? Not quite my type. Bring me a tomato Trocadero... and a flycatcher with oil dressing. I love cannibal, but with a slice of lemon. I prefer it with a slice off the tee. This phone! This isn't Maintenon, this is Richelieu speaking. Why, tear out his left eye with a corkscrew, as usual. Of course. Good-bye. Forgive me, but I must be going. The commissioner has a headache. See you later. My daughter is insane. I hope this condition is only temporary. Allow me to introduce myself: Professor Thales. Pleased to meet you. - Cadet Brochard, my assistant. - Pleased to meet you. And I'm... me! Please do me a favor, sir. My assistant and I must leave for an important engagement... that I can neither suspend nor delay. Please find my daughter and give her this note. Poor cadet. Here you are. I dare say she's not as crazy as she seems. "Academy Of Magic Professor Thales -- White Magic" "My poor child. Please calm yourself. This marriage is heaven-sent for you. I'm counting on you this evening. P.S. And don't forget your head." I must be sleeping like a log. Academy of Magic Does the commissioner still have his headache? Don't be silly. How did you get here? I'm supposed to give you this. Very well. The P.S. is a bit odd, but it's not my fault. And that's the least unusual part of the note. My father is crazy. Why, naturally! Of course, you take me for a lunatic. I take you as you please, with or without your senses. You should know I was putting on an act at the restaurant. Did you get a good look at my fianc?'s face? What did you think? Personally, I like yours better. Thank you. May I ask a question? Why are you marrying him? But will I marry him? One doesn't marry a crazy person. That's why I acted like a mad woman, and I had you as a witness. - So I was a witness? - You witnessed my delirium. Why not tell your father you won't marry that-- My father plays on my gratitude, my affection. I gave in. But at the last minute, I rebelled. You love your father very much? Yes. And yet... he treats me more and more strangely... as what he calls the fateful date approaches. - The fateful date? - When I come of age. I'll be 21 tomorrow at 9:00. - He can't bear the idea. - Strange. His mind is more deranged every day. He thinks I'm crazy. So everything's just fine. I've led you into a strange adventure... haven't I? - Are you sorry you followed me? - Not at all. Nothing surprises me. Everything's possible. - What's your name? - Irene. I'm Denis. By the way, don't forget your head. Thank you. I'd forgotten. Where was my head? - That's amazing! - What's wrong? Nothing. What's more natural than to have a spare head? It's not a bother at all. Since you have two, give me one. - What for? - To worship. I prefer to carry it. If you lost it-- I never lose my head. Or at least not other people's. - Will you be staying? - Are you going to meet your father? Yes. Why? - After what has happened? - Yes. He expects me. I can't make him miss such an important performance. All right. Let's go. What do you mean, let's go? I'm going with you. No. Say good-bye like a good boy. No, Irene. You're in my dream, not the other way around. I decide. - What? - Nothing. You need my arm to defend you, my strength to protect you. I can handle any danger that might threaten you. Come to think of it... why not? It's your size. - Go get dressed. - I hate formal functions. You must dress where we're going. I'm going to dress as well. - Pick it up. - Pick it up? You can get dressed in that little closet. You'll find various sizes of shoes in there. I only need one size. Both my feet are the same. - What am I dropping? - Cards. That suit is a little tricky. It will fit like a glove. Personally, I'd prefer it fit like a suit. Prince Charming, in person! - The hat's not exactly right. - Take your pick. Perhaps this one. What a couple! - Too bad. - Too bad what? Too bad you aren't flesh and blood. Come along if you like... but spare me your sweet nothings. Defend me, protect me... especially against yourself. I'll defend you a little, a lot, passionately, wildly. - Where are we going? - To the Louvre. - At this hour? - What's so surprising? Nothing. Genius knows no working hours. What are you doing? One never knows, sweetheart. Taxi. An ambulance? What for? Perhaps some old painting has fainted. Follow me-- at a distance. I'll drift along in your wake. What's he doing with that hat? It's impossible! He's dreaming. Pleased to meet-- I understand perfectly! Understand what? Clever way of introducing yourself... but I'd already guessed. Come with me. The stage is this way. Excuse me. Who are you? The curator. Here is our little makeshift theater. You have plenty of time to organize your show. Please, I'm waiting. - May I? - Please hurry. Trust me. We'll have her kidnapped. The problem will be solved. What do we risk? Five years. A kidnapping is a disappearing act... and I'm a magician. See how fate arranges everything. The curator is letting us use... this trapdoor. He said it belonged to Queen Margot. Good old Margot! She's helping us out. Let's see where this leads. This kidnapping will put an end to our troubles. Poor child! Here? Yes, here. Let's check our plan. - I can't quite see-- - And yet everything's clear. Either Irene goes quietly to city hall or we have her locked up. She showed signs of dementia at the restaurant... that, with a little embellishment, could easily land her in an asylum. Locking her up will be no problem. For my part, I'd like to see her part away, but it's too risky. It's not risky at all! She'll slide down the chute... and come out here. Her giddiness will make our task easier. Our two friends will appear. Are you there? Yes, boss. She'll get a good scare from seeing them. With good reason. Good evening. Miss, allow me to introduce you... to Dr. Tellier. - Mademoiselle is the daughter-- - Of our magician. I know. You are his prettiest, most ravishing feat. - I'm afraid it's not a difficult one. - What do you mean? To make someone appear is nothing. To make them disappear-- that's another matter. If he made you disappear, I would be very sorry. Watch out for Dr. Tellier. He's a distinguished psychiatrist. All the women are crazy about him. You're giving me a very dangerous reputation. You deserve it. Do you dance? Yes, I dance. Psychiatrists are very frivolous. Well, shall we dance? Wonderful child. There must be a way to stop this wedding. - Can an insane person marry legally? - If he's not recognized as such, yes. - But if he is, then he can't? - No. Fate has sent you to me! She will open this door. What will she find? The ambulance driver. Please, get in, miss. To the loony bin. And a lovely one it is. Come. What loony bin are you taking her to? Stupid! To Dr. Tellier's clinic. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm so sad. Disappointed in love? - He's leaving me. - Who's leaving you? Him. A man I've known since 1795. Since 1795? Do you know why he's leaving me? For Marie-Louise. Napoleon did that to you? It's the only way... to overcome Irene's stubbornness. I forgot the most important thing. Give me back the book. It's of no use to you anymore... if Irene decides to marry you. Not much chance of that. Ladies and gentlemen... please take your seats. The renowned Professor Thales will perform for you... amazing feats of magic. Did you hear that? What are you doing here? - What about you? - What? I insist you leave. - After you. - I'm here in a professional capacity. You mean, in a criminal capacity! - Please, let us do our work. - Yes, let us work. Castoff! Leftover! Supernumerary! I didn't ask your opinion. I'm not in the habit of speaking with hopeless losers. Don't waste time answering him. Get me my robe. I advise you to give up your plan... if you wish to avoid a very unpleasant surprise. Here's Professor Thales... in the flesh, to perform his miracles! Ladies and gentlemen... I'm pleased to make your acquaintance. First, some amusing trinkets for the ladies. I leave because I choose to... but who gave you the right to turn my dream into a nightmare? Here we have an empty box. Absolutely empty! Pigeons. And now the trick of the magic sarcophagi. Here we have two sarcophagi. No double back, no secret openings. Sarcophagi and nothing more. In front of your very eyes... I shall place in one of the sarcophagi... the lady brave enough to trust me. Then I'll pierce the sarcophagus with a sword. Is there a lady present who will help us? No one? - Is there no one? - Yes. I'll do it. I commend the young lady's heroism. Irene, no! This child isn't going to be your guinea pig! The crime-- What time is it? The crime of ten minutes to midnight will not take place. Good act, isn't it? The stooge is excellent. Who are you, sir? You swear you don't know me? I swear! - Never heard of me? - Never! I'm the fly in the ointment, the uninvited guest. Mademoiselle, go back to your seat... and stay away from vampires' traps. Absolutely not. I'm not the kind who walks out. The audience will decide. Yes or no? Shall I perform the miracle of the sarcophagi? Yes! You insist on the assassination of an irresponsible child? - You need a victim. - Yes! - Finish tying her up. - No, listen-- Please step into the sarcophagus. And, now, ladies and gentlemen... you see the second sarcophagus is still empty. Close the first sarcophagus. Watch out, Irene! What are you doing? That's terrible! Denis! - Have you quite finished? - No, I haven't! And to these cruel, mad people, I say-- Specter of spectators-- You've taken Irene! Good-bye, then. I'm going to find her. Let me go! There you are! I was terribly worried. Me too. Look! Do you know those gentlemen? Are they friends of yours? We've seen the body of the lady. Show us the body of the man. I tell you once again: It's impossible. Go back to your crypts! Mummies to the right, mummies to the left. How many of them are there? - Boris? - What? Boris! But it's not surprising to find people you know in your dreams. - Are you free? - Yes. A taxi sent from heaven! So you were saying, I'm not the kind who walks out? Do you think I would have interfered if I hadn't overheard... Dr. Thales' strange plans? They said the kidnapping would save lots of trouble. That's why I butted in where I had no business. Please, forgive me. You showed such courage! It's easy to be courageous in a dream. - What do you do in real life? - In real life? I have a degree in philosophy... but here I am preparing... for an exam in aptitude for love... my degree in Ireneology. - Will I pass? - You talk too much! I'm taking my oral. In the meantime, our taxi's going nowhere. - Where are we going? - I don't know. We can't go to your place or mine. They'll find us right away. Number 13, Lovers' Lane. Who lives there? That's right. You don't know. Tell me what this little book is. - Father's Key to Dreams. - But to what dreams? I know a psychic on Lovers' Lane... who can unlock this book's secret. That taxi taking off-- let's follow it. Is it a private residence? It's a little strange. Is anybody home? Echos have no imagination. How can you make jokes? - You've no sense of reality. - No, I have a sense of unreality. You're dreaming, but you won't give in to your dream. When you're old, you'll be sorry you missed out on so many dreams. Stop, stop! Here it is. - Adelbert? - Denis. Are you really here? How did you recognize me? Your voice is familiar to me. Where have you been in those party clothes? - How did you guess? - From the squeak in your shoe. The young lady you're with must be very pretty to listen to. How did you know there's two of us? I can't claim to see you... but I can sense you, imagine you. I can describe your charming companion. She's wearing a white silk dress. Right? - And I'll wager she's a blonde. - Who told you? I heard the silky voice of her dress. I smelled her perfume, a blonde perfume. You're incredible! He's incredible. A blind man's hearing is sharper than ours... his sense of smell more refined, his sense of touch more accurate. He sees in the dark, whereas we need light. Give me that Key to Dreams so I can find the answer. - How did you-- - I saw it. I saw it in your hand. Strange, this blind man! Pity those who need eyes to see. It isn't a book. I don't feel good about this. It's Pandora's Box! There's a double fold in the cover... and there's a paper inside. The paper's flying away! Let me go! Open this door! If I had known that I was to meet the famous shadow-- For a dream girl, you've got a good hook! For a dream girl, you know how to take care of yourself. A dream girl? - Aren't you the mirage, toots? - What are you talking about? And don't put on airs with me. I'm not dreaming. Don't tell me that mouth isn't real, that those curves are an illusion. I have my feet on the ground and my head on my shoulders. I don't believe in floating spirits. You can call Denis all you want, but he can't find you now. You get it? Do you know the story of Hansel and Gretel? I'll tell it to you. Nurse! Another cuckoo. Bring her in. Let me go! - My poor Nina! - I hurt myself. Here, look at this. The paper I found-- in her bra. In her bra? Very interesting. Good evening, Josephine. Napoleon asked me to welcome you. Please, not you! - Sir, are you the one who-- - Absolutely. Me, myself and I. Very well. Excuse me, where is Dr. Tellier's office? Excuse me? Never forget, when speaking to me, that I am a clock. A Louis XIII, of course. Of course. Absolutely. - What time do you have? - Three pounds. You're slow. - Yes, by three yards. - Cubic? Three yards tick... three yards tock. My spring hurts... and I have a sty on my hour hand. Aside from that, I'm all right. But I'm winding down. You should see a watchmaker. I know the cause. It's hereditary. I come from a long line of clocks. My father was a cuckoo... and my mother a wristwatch. The key to the kingdom. You can wind up the locks. This is very strange. They really are nuts! Thank goodness. I'm in time! You'll never get out of here without a pass. Come. You're not staying here a minute longer. What is it? What do you mean, What is it? Is that any way to introduce yourself? Introductions aren't necessary in a insane asylum... or a cutthroat's den... you charlatan! I'll have you arrested! Emergency Exit Don't look! You can trust me. - It's pretty. - What's pretty? The shadow. - Do you like it? - What? - The shadow. - Yes, very much. My stockings and shoes, please. Do you exist outside of my dream? At this moment I'm asleep in a stupid, crazy, mundane world. What are you saying? I tremble at the thought that a honking horn or a ringing bell... or some idiot talking could wake me up and separate us forever. And yet I must lose you with the dawn. But why? I do exist. I have a birth certificate. I'm real-- Real and alive. I exist because I have a past! - And a childhood, no doubt? - Of course. Irene, that's impossible. I didn't dream of you as a child, so you don't exist. But I do. I swear it! I lived without knowing you. With your father? Professor Thales? Actually, I hardly ever saw my father. My only memory of him is that he wasn't there. - He was always disappearing. - He travelled. He doesn't travel anymore these days... and he uses me in his act. I'm one of his props. A prop that's become a nuisance. He tried to have you kidnapped tonight, and he'll try again. Soon I'll wake up, you'll disappear... and I won't be able to help you anymore. Irene, listen to me. Soon you won't be able to answer my question. I love you. I love you in all tenses: in the present, in the future... even in the subjunctive, which is no small feat. What about you, Irene? Do you love me? I love. Who do you love? Be patient with me. I haven't gotten to the lesson on direct objects. I'll teach you. But that'll be the topic of another lesson. What matters now is the solution to our current problem... and I have a hunch the answer is on that piece of paper you found. - They stole it from me! - To give back to Thales? - It must be. - Where is Thales? Perhaps still in the Den of Illusions. - What's that? - A kind of nightclub he runs. - Where is it? - Next to the Academy of Magic. Not that way! I'm going to tell him a thing or two. - Are you afraid? - I'm afraid for you. At last, a tender word. - Can we get a taxi at this hour? - We don't need one. I'll take you on a magic carpet. Here it is. Den Of Illusions That's funny. The paper you found had been slipped into the binding. The ink wasn't quite dry yet. The binding acted as a blotter. Look. What can you make out here? Official stamps and a signature. It must be a birth certificate. - You're sure Thales is your father? - Of course. - And your mother? - She's dead. - When? - Twenty-one years ago. Strange. - Very strange. - What? Pardon me. Forgive me. They might at least say something. They're mannequins. Appearances-- it's all just appearances. What are you doing? Pardon me, mannequin! My mistake. You! What are you doing here? How did you get in? You claimed I couldn't get into your dream. That I couldn't fight your shadow woman. Wrong. I sneaked in. Madam is the silhouette advertised outside. How do you do, madam? You know one another? I used to, but I don't anymore. And you? How do you know her? She was the guard in the ambulance. What ambulance, my wandering thought? I even gave you a poke in the eye! You're dreaming! - Nina! - What? Anything goes in a dream. Shadows can be frank with one another. What has gotten into the two of you? You may be dreaming, but I'm not. Listen to her! That's funny. But it's true-- she isn't dreaming since she doesn't even exist. - Nina, please, get out! - I'd love to, but I can't. Just stop dreaming about me, and I'll disappear. Fine. Listen closely, Nina. If you don't evaporate immediately... when I wake up, I'll give you such a-- You only say that because you're dreaming. In real life, you wouldn't dare... being as timid as you are. Waiter! Champagne for everybody. Pay me the price of my treachery... since you've bought my complicity. That's right. And not one penny less. Here. Take your money. To your health! I'm not jealous. Each of us has her role, right? I'm his real sweetheart. He's with you only when he's asleep. My dear, since we're dreaming... why don't we make good use of it? He's right. We are dreaming. Because If we weren't-- I heard you. I was wrong. I didn't know you were incompetent. Incompetent? My plan was perfect! You were to marry Irene and her inheritance, and we'd split it. You didn't foresee that Irene wouldn't love me. Is it my fault if you look the way you do? My face is just as good as yours. Is it my fault you were clumsy? Is it my fault you let the document get stolen? Was I the one who took advantage of Irene's money? You were my partner! I didn't know you when her father died. Perhaps you were involved in that. My past is no different than yours. You're the one who led me astray. - Yes, you! - Scoundrel! Cheat! Crook! A revolver solves every problem. I'll tell him what's what! One has to make a good exit. Don't move. I'll count to three. - Professor Thales, please. - That way. Boris! This guy's always chasing me. two-- You again! One second more and I would no longer have been here. You've really come at the last minute. You will explain your behavior immediately. I answer only to God now, and He's waiting for me. We have an appointment, and I will not stand Him up. No, you're staying here. You'll leave only when I have your confession. - I'll count to three. - Don't shoot! - Don't shoot the piano player. - One! - It'll be bad for business. - Two! - The police will arrest you. - What do I care? I'm dreaming. I've been dreaming ever since someone woke me up at the flower market. A man who's dreaming can only commit an imaginary murder. The blood he sheds is only in his imagination. Do phantoms have blood? No. We're phantoms. But you're a rascal of a phantom. For the moral of this story, the villain must die. What could be more pleasant than to kill with impunity? You don't exist. Killing you is a bit redundant... isn't it? When I wake up, having committed the crime... my conscience will be clear. I will drink to your ghost. I said one... - two... - Don't! I'll tell you everything! I wanted to get my hands on Irene's fortune. I already squandered some of it-- I've had a hard life! An accountant was to examine my books this morning. Irene is about to turn 21. What time is it? 3:00, miss. And you're not her father? Her father was my friend. What was his was mine. When he died, Irene was only one year old, and very rich. I've never told her... she was an orphan. - You stole her money. - Granted. And to avoid an accounting problem this morning, I had resolved-- - To make her vanish. - That's my profession. You bungled your chance, my friend. I couldn't rely on my accomplices. You are unworthy of haunting my dream any longer. A thousand pardons... but I'm putting an end to you. Three! Allow me to place these flowers on my grave. And have mercy on me. I'll not stand in your way. Marry Irene's phantom. It's yours. And be grateful to me for squandering her fortune. This way no one can say... you're marrying for money. This rascally phantom is a strange fellow. Come, Boris. Your mission isn't finished. It's marvelous! Thales is not your father. - He's seen the light. - What? We're all dreaming! We're engaged. Kiss me! Oh, so we're dreaming! Then, if we're dreaming... dream that I'm kissing you! When we wake up in a while, it'll all be over. You're right. You again! Yes, it's me again. You don't know the whole story. Thales has given me the most wretched task. - And I accepted. - That's you, all right! Thales asked me to make you take this drug. A drug? What for? To get rid of you. But I'll do nothing of the sort. It's not in me to do such a wretched thing. Drug a sleeping person? How ironic! I want you to earn the pay of your treachery. You can pay what you owe me. I'll drink it. It won't hurt me. My God! Don't worry. It won't have any effect on me. Dear Irene... to our love! To our love! Drinking from the same glass! That's too much. I apologize, Irene. My dear Boris... I'd like you to note that your little potion... has no effect on us. At last, I'm happy. What can one do to a happy man? My dear Irene. We can-- We can-- Yes, Denis. We can-- That wasn't a round of drinks-- that was a massacre. Waiter... take away the bodies! Take them to the academy. - Give him back his things. - Where? Right there. Take my daughter up to her room. To her room. Fine. There you go! According to what he said, he works right around here. - Are you through sleeping? - Aren't you going to wake up? - Where were you? - You look awful! I've been dreaming. What a dream. Dreaming? I'll bet you met a gal. She made a big impression on you. And Thales was there-- - I swear I was dreaming! - Have you seen your face, my friend? My face? What's wrong with my face? Was it a dream, or is was it lipstick? Come and have something to eat. - I can't. - Why? - What about her? - What? Her! Funny guy. Now he's chasing after his dream. You put me through some night, my friend! I'm really sorry. But I'll have you know I don't act this way in real life. It was a dream, Doctor. I've wasted enough time with you, sir. Go find Irene and leave me in peace. - But I'll never be able to find her. - I don't care. She's getting married. Not to me. To someone else. I tell you, we made a reservation. We called you. Come with me. You can explain it to the boss. I know nothing about it. Pardon me, sir. What's become of the man who lived here? What man? The one who lived in the little room on the first floor, on the right. Didn't you know the house was abandoned two years ago? Two years? How time flies! Here's your breakfast. No, thanks. I don't want any. What's going on with you? I just lived through a night that was... fantastic. Are you still dreaming? Now is when the dream begins. That is, the nightmare. If I weren't so tired... I'd commit suicide. Why did I lose you? It can't be! Hello, Denis. She calls me by my first name. It must be her. I mean, it must be you. I mean, it must be us. How did you find me? It was the easiest thing in the world. I found your address when I woke up. - Where? - In my hand. Who could have given it to you? I'm sure it must have been that man who seemed to know you so well... the one with the poison. Boris! Thank you for coming to set my mind at rest. Don't go yet. Of course, you mustn't make the other fellow wait. - What other fellow? - Your fianc?. Rest assured, I won't make him wait long. I am promptness personified. A few more minutes, seconds-- No, Irene, don't tease me. I'm all out of aces. I played them all in vain last night-- I lost everything. Here. Your friend Boris also gave me this paper. I need it to get married. It's the one from The Key to Dreams. Listen, Irene. I have a confession to make... and don't get me confused. It's hard to speak when one isn't dreaming. I've imagined a girl like you so often... I really thought it was a dream when I saw you. My daily dream. I know now it wasn't... that it was a marvelous coincidence. I know you exist, and my dream is no longer mine. I know you spoke last night... of the lesson about direct objects. I know that you even kissed me. Now you're marrying another man. What's that? It's nothing. Just my alarm clock. 9:00. Time for my class. The hour of my freedom! I'm exactly 21 years old. I just came of age. Or had you forgotten? I'm free, Denis. At last I can be with my fianc?. You! Me. This is too wonderful. This is marvelous. Quiet now, I'm already awake... yet my dream continues. Love, give us our daily dream. Love, give us our daily dream.
