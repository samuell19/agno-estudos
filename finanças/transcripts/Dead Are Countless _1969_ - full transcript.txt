Run! Dad, be careful! The soldiers are coming, they will kill you! You can't keep running forever. Show yourself! How dare you talk to a superior like that? You filthy pig, why are you accusing me? Of betrayal. Well, I'll show you who... What's wrong, dad? We will see my daughter, but I don't think she has anything. Is he hurt? The soldiers are coming, father, they will kill you! Calm down boy, we're friends. They killed him... Julie, hide! I am a bandit and I will kill you! I surrender, but don't shoot. Oh Julie... What a beautiful city! I like it. What is written there? This is Bells City Those who do not hear him must not enter the city. But many did not understand... ... and they started to shoot the tablet so that the bell could be heard. Give me your gun, I want to try. Be careful Johnny, you could kill someone. Can you hit the plate, Uncle Klaus? Very good! You are formidable. Leave me, you're suffocating me. I want you to teach me to shoot like you! Maybe one day. Uncle Klaus, are they going to kill each other? Come on, it's better not to see. Johnny! Do you want to kill someone boy? There is no danger, now I know how to shoot. Where did you find this weapon? Well, in the street after a duel. Will you teach me how to shoot? First you have to learn that a man is a man... ... When he uses force to defend the rights of others. The weapon is always held with the barrel towards the target. Vision is very important. A tenth of a second can cost you your life. The hand is never held below the waist. Let me try! So? I ask you for the last time. When will the due diligence pass? Within 25 days.. Urgent. At Fort Grant. The lieutenant is dead. Greetings. Johnny. What do you guys think? That he is undoubtedly a murderous maniac! Whose sole purpose is to kill those who wear the uniform. Exactly and because it is a personal problem, I decided to answer personally. Excuse me sir, but don't you think it's a bit absurd to send an army against a man? I didn't say I would send an army, but only one of our men, with the order to arrest him. He wouldn't stand a chance, because the sheriff can capture him. - It depends on who this man is. - Do you have someone in mind? Yes ! Lieutenant Harris. Garringo? Lieutenant! The colonel wants to speak to you. Mr. Colonel! I want you to find this man. - Now ? - Immediately! Colonel, forget that I'm under arrest, so I can't leave. Leave it alone, we have to stop him from committing any more crimes. You must arrest him, not kill him. But I want to remind you that a free criminal is always a danger to society. My order is to bring him in. Dead only as a last resort. I think you will not refuse this mission. I have several reasons for accepting the mission... Among other things to get my release. - Temporary! I understand, Mr. Colonel! It seems that the lieutenant who was killed had relations with a woman named Sara. You will find her in Goliath, the town from where that telegram was sent. Do you know the man who sent this message? No, sir. Was he alone? - Him and three more. And you don't you know any of those three either? No, sir. - Are you sure ? - I swear ! I'll tell you the truth, they were definitely from out of town. Good. Tonight, you'll come to town with me. But Sir, I can't close the post at night, I have work, you understand? Today you will. - Where is Sarah? - Upstairs. Wait here ! - A long time ? - Little bit. Drink up, I pay, but if you leave, you pay. Listen, where do you think you are? Only I ask questions. And he will answer you. This moron is doing great. Get out. I'm looking for a man. And what do I care? Didn't you hear me? I told you to get out! Do you know Lieutenant Johnson? Leave me alone ! Answer, you know him? Yes, damn it! And the man who killed him? No, no, let me go. Are you sure you don't know him? I don't know anything, I can't take it anymore. Actually, I've known him for a long time. The lieutenant came with a friend who was looking for Johnny. Keep going ! Are they here ? Yes Yes. Which one ? Which one ? The one with the back. - Leave the MAN alone, you wretch! - Ah! Where are the others? where is Johnny You know what you're paying for right? And this is only a small part... I'm hanging you for killing an active duty officer. But before that you will tell me where your accomplices are. Ok.. I saw it all. What does this remind you of ? Come over ! Who the hell are you ? What are you talking about ? I'll refresh your memory. Put your feet in here. Enough with the jokes. Get off my land! Don't make me repeat myself. Put your feet in here. Now, do you understand what I mean? I know nothing. On my word. Where are the other assassins? I know nothing ! Does this refresh your memory? I know nothing. I swear, I don't know anything! Good. I say everything, put me down! Where are they? Don't try to prevent it. Johnny doesn't expect you to look for him, what else do you want from me. Your partner will tell me where Johnny is. You won't like it at all if you lied to me. Stand still! It's me Bill, calm down. who are you with - A friend. Good ! - And who is this? - I already told you, he's a friend. I'd better introduce myself. Some know me by Garringo. And if you're interested, I'm an American lieutenant. And therefore a comrade of all those you killed. I've already told you that we only follow orders. -Where is Johnny waiting for you? -Ask the spy. You won't get anything from me. You think ? I wouldn't be so sure. Try. Get the gun! I'll give you a chance. As you did not with others. Raise the gun. We will camp here. Are you going to untie me finally. I already told you where Johnny is. What else do you want to know? Nothing. Just to find out if you're telling the truth. Hands up ! I am unarmed. What are you looking for here? Have I changed so much in 24 years? Johnny... you scared me! What a fool you are... How happy I am... I have the right to hug you son. I don't see why not. How long has it been Johnny? I was beginning to think something had happened to you. You're in time to have dinner with us... everything will be ready in a minute. OK. Now let's serve a wine that I save for special occasions. You're starting to turn gray, Uncle Klaus. Time does not pass in vain. - Are you serious ? - Yes. Yes, it seems like a joke, doesn't it? A guy like me. You've been made sheriff? Johnny, it's almost an honorary job at Bells City... It's a quiet place. And now, let's talk about you. Are you staying with us for good? No. Just a few days. I'm waiting for some friends, but I'm here to see you. Did you earn a lot of money? You worked on a good ranch no? I'm sure there isn't a cowherd like you. Well, Uncle Klaus now that the questions are over. Could I taste your wine? Coffee ? We leave immediately. Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot... Hello, Bob. - Hi Julie, What's the old man doing? You mean me perhaps? Excuse me Sr. Klaus, I wasn't talking to you - Come. Come on. Help me, the stagecoach is coming. - What does it smell like? - Nothing in particular. You perfumed yourself. Have you noticed ? - Why are you laughing ! - Don't worry Bob... The coach is arriving with the doctor and his daughter... I wanted to show them... ... that here, as in the East there are also gentlemen. You think his daughter is young and beautiful, don't you? What a smell...! Be careful, the bees don't come for you... HA HA! The Stagecoach! Sleepy! - What time is it ? - Almost ten. Julie... Did someone come asking for me? No. It's strange, they should have arrived. Who? Those friends I mentioned. I have told you before. Let's hope they got lost. That way you will stay longer with us. Greetings Tom, Hello Julie. I'm hungry. Good morning ladies and gentlemen, you have half an hour to eat. Thank you. Julie. Even if I feed the coyotes, I'll trade horses just for you Always the same. Hey, Bob, come on. Come over. I'm coming, look at me. Are you Dr. Grayson? - Yes, sir. - Welcome to Bells City. This is my daughter Nancy... - Delighted miss. Doctor, if you show me diligence I will lead you. - You can go, Nancy. - Greetings. - Thank you Mr... - Klaus. I'm the Sheriff of Bells City.. ...if there's anything you need. What is this smell? Yea, what of it?! Hey man, no need to get angry. It's a free country. If you are not afraid to get dirty, could you water the horses? Excuse me. - Can I get you a coffee? No, thank you. I can carry the suitcase. And here we know what it means to be a gentleman. Leave it I said! I said let it go. Let me go ! Senseless! Let me go... See ? I better help you. Do not touch me ! Savage! This is Johnny my son. I think my daughter will have a hard time adapting. I don't think so, she's brave. Is the city far? Not very. I have an understanding with Mr. Potter... I want to buy his farm. Didn't he tell you anything sheriff? Don't trust Potter with a dollar to sell you a cure that would save your life. We'll leave when you want. Caballero, would you mind feeding the horses? On the contrary, sir. Goodbye, boy, and tell me what brand the perfume was. Don't worry, I love being around someone who smells like you. Really ? It cost a dollar "THE BOTTLE". "Oh yes " ? Johnny, hurry! Take him home! Johnny, help us. Is he one of your friends? No. What's up Johnny? I want to know who it is. Why are you so interested? I see you are very worried. Get out of here! Who shot you? Wait, please, can't you see he is in no condition to talk? Stay out of my business. Leave me. I want to know who killed my friends. Did you kill my friends? Was it you? You're crazy. Get out of here! Stay away. He is a criminal, he killed one of my companions! And I suppose he killed others as well. Be patient until he can answer you. Johnny! Can't you see he can't talk? I know you are not violent but what are you doing now... Okay, as you wish. Let's leave things to Uncle Klaus. This is the law. Do you need anything else ? No, thanks. To defend the law That's what we will do. A good man, right? Yes, "magnificent"... But as a friend. Is Damon still here? Damon? He's out of town. Something serious? No. We are old friends. We've known each other since we were little children. He was older than me but now he kind of forgot me. A special bottle. Of course, Johnny, I'll get it right away. And see if you can drink it all... How are you Doctor ? Good. Good evening Miss. She still hasn't forgotten what happened that morning. Can I invite you? Of course... Did things go well? I don't want to talk about it, we just booked a room at the Hotel. Didn't you buy Potter's farm? That's what I thought, but he changed his mind. So my friend Potter didn't keep his promise? - Do you know him? - Yes. - How? - Well, we are like a family. - You have no idea how happy I am! - Nancy, please. Let her be upset. Give me the contract. You made a contract, didn't you? For what do you need ? Mr. Gray, I'll prove to you that we're friends, I'll talk to Potter. And I am sure that I will convince him. You think so ? He seems like a difficult guy to me. Give me the contract. Father ! Hello daughter, what's wrong? Nothing serious. I came to call the doctor, but first I want to talk to you. - Do you feel sick? - No, I'm fine. Look ! I was about to leave this morning, when a stranger arrived. He was dying, I didn't expect him to recover. But luckily he recovered. - Why didn't you come to me first? - You're right, but I couldn't leave him. Okay, let the doctor know. Listen Father, if you want to talk to him, you better wait until the morning. May I know why? Johnny wanted something from him earlier. He lost control... that's not how he was supposed to behave. I understand, tell me what the stranger looks like? He's a man young, tall... blue eyes... a real... - He looks like a real... - What does he look like? He doesn't look like anything. What do you want ? Who gave you permission to enter ? Didn't you hear? In order to implement the agreement, I am signing this document... ... In which both parties declare... What the hell is this? Both sides declare... to agree to the terms. See Potter, you agree. And you should sign here. I won't sign anything, my farm values ​​double! It's robbery and your threats are of no use. But who said I'm threatening you? That's not why I came. Then why did you come? To kill you! - No, you're not serious. Once dead, you'll know I'm serious. Wait, wait... I'll make you my partner, I'll give you half of what Grayson paid. Sign here, and that's it! Now ? I don't have a pen. Is this good? But... but I have no ink. My name is Klaus my friend. I'm Garringo and I'm an officer. Now I see that you are better. Anyway, my house is at your disposal I hope I didn't bother you too much. I leave tomorrow. It's not possible, the doctor said to get up in a few days. You know very well that doctors' recommendations are sometimes impossible When you feel better, I hope you will be kind enough to answer me a question. It is possible, even now. - My son Johnny told me... - Are you Johnny's father? Do you know him ? Well.. there are many who are called Johnny. What did he tell you? That he killed a friend of yours. But I hope it's a mistake. Yes, it must be a mistake. Unfortunately, it is not. What do you want to say ? That I killed the two men that Johnny was waiting for. Did the perpetrator confess? He couldn't anymore. I didn't have the strength or ability to follow the man that was running I had to shoot or let him get away. It wasn't nice of me but I shot. - Why... - Why ? Why did you shoot a defenseless man? Because he was a criminal. Which did not give anyone the opportunity to save themselves. Do you know, sheriff, what a danger a free assassin can be? You have to prove what you said. Johnny does not associate with criminals. I'm sorry to say this, But I'm convinced that Johnny is one of them. Perhaps the most dangerous of all. I came for him, Mr. Klaus, to arrest him. and I also represent the law, like you. It is not possible. It's not possible ! There must be a mistake. Johnny is not what you say. Can not be. Get him out and tell him I'm here to get him. I don't want to deceive you. As a sheriff, you represent the law. I raised Johnny and I can't believe it... If necessary, I hope to have the strength to do my duty. Good night. I am sorry. Good night. You see him ? Nowhere. - He left the farm at dawn. - Did he tell you where he was going? No, I asked an the saloon, in the store... but no one saw him. He must have left town. Is it something serious? No... But if you see him, tell him to come and talk to me urgently. Look sheriff. - Which is the house? - That one ! We're almost there. It would've been better for them to wait at the Hotel for old Potter to leave the Ranch.. Be careful not to fall. - Is there more? - A few hundred meters. No, I meant the furniture. I brought only the necessary. Is it necessary? We are only staying for a few months. What the ? A few months and then you move? Why do you ask? For nothing miss. For nothing. What do you want from me ? I want someone to kill four people before they can shoot. You did well to think of me. - I'm always ready. - You sure ? You drank too much. Nonsense... I have never been better than now. If you want I can prove it. Well, how many do we have? We are three, they are twelve. You did not go to school. But I will do the math. Four to one - That's right. Alcohol suits you well, I'm leaving. - Who else is coming? Tell Fred, I'll be waiting for you at the saloon... within 15 days. ... at night. Johnny, your not forgetting something? Three parts, and there's more dollars than you've ever seen before. And I can't know what it is about? The most important thing you already know, four to one. Would be easier if there were more of us, but that would reduce our share... don't you think? Soon I will give you other details. Of course Johnny you are the boss. I'll let Fred know! Thank you for so many days of patience. I won't forget. - Me neither. It's not Johnny's life that worries me, Julie. But of the people who are in danger as long as he is alive. I'm sorry, for your father and for you. I will do my best to get the court to decide. That's all I wanted to ask of you. Look at this shard. It seems recently broken. We will wait for him here. Bells City is close. We will find a place to camp. Yes I know. I am of the same opinion. I understand all the charges. I only ask you to remedy the situation as soon as possible. Sure, Sheriff, but I'm here to arrest Johnny. I am responsible for all the crimes he committed. Why ? I know the story, Julie told me. Johnny is a madman who only feels powerful with a gun in his hand. I taught him to shoot. It's like I see him. He was furious. Terrified, as a child he lived with the fear of death. He faced life far too early. Only the bravery he did brought him joy. - Do you know when he will come back? - I do not know. Fine, I will wait. Try to stay out of this. No, there is no going back, to make things clear. There is only one place for him: Prison. It's okay. In the best case. Did you hear the bell sheriff? I heard her. That means we've arrived. Good morning, sheriff. - Good morning. - Do you only greet him? I'm sorry, good morning everyone. That's better. I like it here. - How long are you planning to stay? - We are peaceful people, Sheriff. - I'm glad. - We will stay as long as we want. - Don't look for the reason, find your way. - Please. - Leave ! Are you OK with that ? - Come on, I don't want a scandal. - I don't like threats. Come on, Peter. See you soon friend. Do you want to ruin everything? I don't like it when people talk to me like that. I'm tired of being your babysitter. I can let them kill you before we even finish the job. Do you admit you cheated on me? You are crazy my friend if that was the case you would be dead by now. No one can ask for my money back. But I won, the money is mine! Here I agree with you! Then give me the money. That's what I don't agree with anymore... Did I make myself understood? Don't worry, my friend, you have a lot of luck and I have very little. I was not gifted with this. Give me back my money! It's in my pocket, come and get it. Come on kid, it's not hard. You just have to kill me first. Brave, right? I can't tell you anything else. - Does Damon live far from here? - A day of walking. Do you know if Johnny said he was coming back? I don't remember, but I think so. Goodbye. - How much do I owe you ? Forty five dollars. Who says ? I say. The score is clear, five for whiskey... ...and the rest that you've stolen from that man. Yes, I know... If not, you go to jail. You say so... Don't take another step! Put the money on the table... and leave. The man whose life is worth more than $45 has not been born yet. Not yours either? Let's clear up the problem! Try to shoot I don't want to have any advantage. On the contrary. You don't have a single chance. And the five dollars for whiskey. This time you got off easy. - Good evening, can I help you? - Thank you, but I don't need help. - Wait, where are you going? - Let me go! It hurts! - I just want to talk. - Please, let me go.. - I have nothing to talk about. - I am not of the same opinion. - Let me go! You have to be nice to me. I don't like skinny women! - Let me go. No. You may go, ma'am. I understand but I don't like to leave things unfinished. Wait for me! You're a bit late... I'm a gentleman. Ladies first... But if you insist. Why are you following me ? To arrest you. I have other plans. Sheriff, I heard you're looking for me. Yes ! “Mr… - Harriman. Mr. Harriman, I want to know something about you. I assume you already know what happened to your companion. I feel sorry for him. So? What are you thinking about... He deserved it. I told him hundreds of times... Yes... ... But what are you doing here in this city? Sheriff... I didn't do anything. And I am not obliged to answer your questions. That's what you say, but here I am the law. I work for the law. In a sense. What does this mean ? A certain meaning. Let's say they catch criminals, but not officially, so to speak. I understand... And you consider those who have their heads cut off as enemies. Of course Sheriff, this is also an honest way to earn a living. Are you looking for someone in particular? Are you personally interested in this? No. So then I prefer not to discuss it. I think you understand my job is very discreet. One little inattention and I can lose a lot of money if someone beats me to it. What happened, Julie? Why did you come back? You don't want to see me anymore my sister? Come let me hug you and tell you how happy I am. Please Johnny I need to talk to you... ... Garringo told me everything. - Who is Garringo? - Don't try to trick me, don't you... ... The man looking for you. - He's still here ? He's in the city, what are you waiting for, run Johnny! What did he tell you? - Things we prefer not to know. And you believed? He is a liar. He killed two of my friends without them being able to defend themselves! You're like a brother to me, I'm afraid... They want to arrest you and try you... Well, pretend you are judged by a court. Please don't go! No one will stop me from going. I have to give a present. The first calf on your farm Tell me, what shall I do with this calf? Feed it and it will grow. With the bottle of course... It's very sweet, I love getting presents. Do you really like it? - Why did you do it ? Well, actually, I don't know. I was thinking about you and then I saw the calf... I don't know where I can keep him until we leave for the ranch. - In the barn. - Is that so ? He is very nice. Come on go. How stubborn he is. Come on. Move it ! Let's go... Come on. What do you want ? I saw you from a distance and thought it was an illusion. And you are looking to get killed? Don't you think it's gone too far... I don't see why one should resort to such extremes. Hurry up, you have no choice. I'm sorry to contradict you, but you will have to come with me. I'm not very patient! I've been waiting for you for several days Johnny. Okay then, that's for another time. No. Now ! OK. Let's finish now. - Choose where you want to die. - Think about it, boy... You have no chance to escape. No ! Hang in there Johnny! Get out ! Be careful, I can not give a much advantage. I support you Johnny, but it's not enough.. I'd rather see you dead than see you like this. Stop it, don't make me kill you in front of her. Give me the gun! Give it to me! Do not even think about it... Do not try ! Give it to me ! Okay old man. I will remember the good things. What do you want from me ? Lieutenant Garringo. Now understand ? The comrade of those whom you killed! I gave them the same opportunity to defend themselves as they gave my father. None! Understand ? None! Understand?... Understand... ? You're crazy, Johnny! Sheriff, I'll be back later. Hey Garringo! Julie takes a while to sort things out. I considered you my son. I know. You were a child... When I killed a man here. Do you remember ? Yes. You said... you wanted me to teach you how to shoot. And I taught you. You.. You are my handiwork Johnny. You feel responsible? Yes? Yes. I think we know each other. May I ? Please. Your name is Damon, right? Stay calm, I'm not the law. Where do you know me from ? You are wanted, there is a reward on your head Sit down, I'm going to dump you. Now leave us alone. You are friends with Johnny, aren't you? And what? - I know he was arrested. I want to get him out of there too. And why ? For a special reason. If you want to help him, you must listen to me. Sheriff wait, don't go to the door. It can be a trap. The man is injured. I have to see what happened cover me Sheriff! Drop the gun if you want to stay alive. You, come out! No, don't do it Harris! Drop the gun! And now, release the prisoner. Stop, it's an order! Come on. Free the prisoner! Or I will force you. You heard ? Let's rest a little. Put it down. You're tough, aren't you? Shall we leave him here, Johnny? No. I want them to see something. He needs evidence to convict me and I'll give it to him... Are you tired Lieutenant? You taught me this game. how are you feeling? - You lack courage, you are just a coward. Since you're in the military, I'd like to give you a chance to defend yourself... Although the result would be the same. You think you're superior, eh? And that gives you strength? I know the story... Raise your hands! Stay put, lieutenant! Lieutenant. You could have been punished because of us. You would have liked to run away, wouldn't you? Look Johnny, the gold. It's more than we expected. You heard ? Go ! What are you waiting for ? Do not trust me lieutenant ? Get a horse. Go ! Okay. What's here is for everyone. For you. And for you. We agreed to divide it into three parts. - That's what we did. The difference is that they are not equal. It's a good joke. But it would be appropriate to divide equally. Damon. Explain to him if he didn't understand. No problem Johnny, I agree. But I do not, drop the money and raise your hands. This is not fair, you are forcing me to kill you. - I don't think you will succeed. - Okay. Let's not argue. You are right. - Step away from the bag. Damon, if you don't agree, say so. I told you, Johnny, it is fine for me. Well, here we meet for the last time. You're right. That's how it is Johnny. Get a horse. You can leave, our understanding is over. Good luck. "SINCERELY JOHNNY" Sr. Harris, I know where to find him... But in exchange for the reward. You have ten seconds to drop your weapons. Listen Garringo and I'll give you ten seconds to choose where you want to die. Want to see ? He's crazy, he doesn't stand a chance against you. I will give you the opportunity to take the entire reward. He can't be far, he's hurt, the only place he can be is Bells City. I know, I am sorry. But I'm going alone, I don't need you anymore. - How do you think you're going to stop me? - I don't mind killing you. Drop the weapon. Doctor! Nancy... Doctor! Open the door, doctor. Nancy! Someone cut your nails, didn't they Johnny? Where do you want to die here or a little later? Come on, try it! I will give you the same chances you have given others. No, Damon. Don't do that... listen... I'll tell you where the money is. But don't shoot, don't shoot Damon! You can have it all I want nothing Damon... It's all yours, no, don't shoot... Wait, Damon, no, no... Don't shoot Damon, no, no... ... Don't shoot, don't shoot, shoot.. Damon... don't shoot! I'm sorry. Thank you. Thank you, Garringo.
