In Paris of another time The accordion nostalgic Played so many tunes That their echoes linger still In our hearts Songs with clumsy rhymes That tried to be Verlaine or Bruant or Carco The street-singer rang out: "Pay what you willl" "Paris Will Always Be Panamel" and "Nothing's as Good as Love" Now the TVis lit By this ghost from the past Returning to haunt us A posthumous successl Sing out that awful old song Corny, smug, tried and true Put straps on the piano where they belong It's spring and the sky is blue This is not a dump. This is a playground. SPOILED CHILDREN Every caress, every confidence survives. To Colo, of course. Today I'd like the two of us to make. other animals. You know. those strange animals. you dream about at night. Or wait! I have an ideia. We'll make a house for the animals. Both of us! We'll draw one. We'll draw them a house. Want to? Lift your hands. Pick the color you want. Green, orange, blue or red. Draw a house with them. What'll we put in it? Is there a path up to it? Windows? I've been waiting at home for 1 hour. Damn! I completely forgot. I'm always on the run. What was it for again? Rougerie. Here it is! 1 or 2 rooms? That's right. We won't find a thing at $300. I'm to see one today! I do have a place in Asni?res. You said at the D?fense for $350! It's $400 now. In the "Tristan-Isolde" building. The charges are extra. Want it? I don't know. What floor? What about the heating and the phone? I don't know. We'll have to see. So let's go! You'll drive me there and bring me back. - What? - I never drive at rush hour. We'll come back another way. We got a bit lost, hein? Get out here. I'll park the car. On 2nd thoughts, I won't see it. I've changed my mind. I'll show it to my lawyer and send it back in 2 days. You saw the people waiting outside? If you want it, sign the lease I just read you. If not, do as you wish. Rougerie? I'm Baraduc. - Sorry I'm late. - Don't worry about it. Here's your place. See how big it is. A huge balcony! That goes. You pay by check or in cash? Pay what? Mouchot mentioned my commission? What commission? I dealt with Mr Mouchot, not an agent. Yes I work with him. I have the keys. I do the inventory. Impossible! You mean you won't take it? I must! I've made appointments, bought furniture! Anyway, I've signed. It's in the contract. - How much is it? - A month's rent. I warn you. I'll caII Mouchot. What? November, not December. - I made a mistake. - That can happen. No, I'll fiII in the rest. We'll leave the carpet. Now we'll see the kitchen. - There's a hole in the waII. - What? But it'll be fixed soon. If it's yes, it's hopefulness. If it's no, it's great distress. Yes, no, yes, no, yes. Catherine? Cricri! Hi, Papa How are you? - Fine. - Me too. Everything's ok. Why're you here? What about the movies? I'm going tomorrow. To see what? Kali Jug, Goddess of Vengeance. - Terrific! - You're sure? Where's Mama? Out? She took Julien to the doctor. He may have chickenpox. He'll have sores. No baths, no scratching. Serves him right. I got an A in math on my grade card. I'm glad. - A what? - An A in math. WeII! Throw that out. Wait, I must finish packing. It's Roger Larant. I must see you soon. I got a great script. It's perfect for you. A love story between a man and a woman. And in the other way as well. It's weird, very weird. Bernard, it's Catherine. I'm at the doctor's. Julien may have chickenpox. Fold your jacket welll We'll eat at home. Hello. You're Roger Larant's secretary? Please teII him Bernard Rougerie rang. TeII him I'm in the Sahara. Yes, the Sahara! Hot! Very, very hot! Please teII him Thanks. When do you leave? When? Tomorrow. You're always away. I need peace and quiet to work. Your dumb boss makes you work too much. It's not my boss. It's me. Mama's treating a little girl who refuses to talk. - She won't talk? - She doesn't say a word. She's not like you! - And my allowance? - I'll give it to you. One fitted double sheet. Hurry, ladies, it's almost timel Get to your countersl A fine day is beginningl Smile at our customersl You too, Miss Muletl Prepare your change and your smilesl It's from there! What crap! All your streets are one-way! And as for parking? Let's have a look. It's tiny. - What's the rent? - $350. It's a lot! But you got carpeting. Pretty It's original. Try to find better! I brought a record. Sonny Rollins! Remember? "St Thomas". I stole it from my ex-wife. She won't miss it. Women don't dig jazz! "Charlie Parker's too squeaky!" That's what they say about him! - Where's it go? - Anywhere! There's no hi-fi, TV, radio. Nothing! I rented this place to work in. Away from everything! Want a hand? Help me make the bed. What's that? The supermarket downstairs. You found a fine place! It swings! It lives! Give me the sheet instead! - How's your script? - I'm stuck. It's going nowhere. PuII it Grab it! I start shooting in the spring. If I'm not done in a month, I'm up the creek. What's it about? I have the 1st version here. - Want to read it? - Just teII me the theme. the story line. PuII the sheet tight! It's about a guy who leaves everything. his wife, kids, job. Who is he? What's his job? He's a Parisian industrialist with a big profitable factory. He's got money. He heads south. Not to Nice but. a seedy little town. He meets a girl there, who's seedy too. He's wanted. He gets away. It's their escape together. - Their story. - Do they screw? That's what bugs me. - You gave the address? - No! Who is it? - I'll open it. - Don't! We live in the building. and wanted to teII you about. the Tenants' Defense Committee. It meets tonight. A Tenants' Defense Committee! Lucky you! So? The young lady wiII teII us! It's simple. The more we are, the better! We only come here to work. So tenants' groups. Tonight at 9! But we're not normal tenants. You don't mind being cheated? She has a point there! - But we have no time. - It won't take long. We have to work! Sorry, but we must make the bed! Marcel, I'd say it's hopeless. The meeting's at my place, 6th floor right. I'm Marcel Bonfils. Bonfils, Marcel Fine. Seen the hole in the kitchen? Yes, I saw it. If I end up working with you. How much can I ask for? $6000? 8000? You could go up to $10000. 10. Look, I'll sign a contract for 8000. plus 2000 under the table, that way my wife won't know! Because women. are greedy vultures! More so than men are! In fairy tales, the prince weds the shepherdess, not vice-versa! That surely means something, hein? Catherine doesn't mind if you sleep here? No. Why? You don't usually work this way! I don't know. I need the peace and quiet. This film seems much harder. It's very delicate. I need to be alone. It can be my office later. - You and Catherine are ok? - Sure! We're just fine! You'll end up like Simenon who can only write in hotel rooms. Not the elevator! - Why? - That goes down the stairs. Got your keys? How've you been doing? Fine Fine! - Seeing whores? - As usual, but it's hard! They're expensive. Especially hi-class gals! The streets are cheaper! Can we help you, Miss? No need. To the dry-cleaner's! Where the English clean even the spleen! I rang a callgirl the other day and said. "It's the 'tough' customer!" She named me that! And a cop replied, "Tough or not, no one's home!" I parked over there. Bye, Miss! The meeting's at 9? Yes. See you later! There you are! - The other? - Don't bother! Raining? What kind of work do you do? I'm writing a film. - About what? - I wish I knew. - You did Deathwatch? - Yes. It wasn't bad. I didn't like the end much. I'd like tokens for two machines. So what about my ending? WeII, it's a compromise. the way I see it. A typical "happy ending". There's bitterness in the story. Yet it seemed as if you tried to eliminate aII that. You do your washing at night? You do yours at a special time? About the tenants' meeting. What? You're interested? If that's your reaction. See for yourself tonight! What a lot of TV sets! Some soap, please. I saw you have TV. But only 1 channel works and it's an opera! Do you think I can...? It's La Traviata! - Are you hungry? - Yes. Great, huh? Verdi! He's terrific! - Know where we can eat near by? - Yes. But I can't pay. I'm broke. Fine. Leaving your laundry here? I'll get it later. The meeting's at 9. Not just in French films! What's the greatest love scene ever shot? Bergman's Silence. WeII! It could be. - Bogart and BacaII in. - In what? I forget. It's where she says. "Just whistle!" Not bad, but wrong. Pierrot Le Fou? It's in a Laurel and Hardy film. - Hardy is. - He's thin? Fat. He asks Laurel. "Ya like me more than apple pie?" Laurel looks at Hardy. then at the audience, then at Hardy. Then at the audience. and he starts to cry. - Great? - Yes, it's great. Antoine calls her 8 days later. 8 days later. Impossible! 8 days? No! 8 days later. Not 8 days later. It won't make sense! It won't make sense to Antoine either! Shit! With no encounter, I've no story. With no story, I've no film! The lease itself puts us in the wrong. The landlord has aII the rights. Anne-Marie wants to speak! You going too? It's here. Joffroy! It's open! Let Mrs Descombes talk! One at a time! - Can you move over? - Mrs Bonfils' seat! Any stools left? - I'll go. - There're no more. I've been sitting aII day! I'll make room for you. Isn't he a movie star? Can we go on? Take turns talking or we'll stiII be here tomorrow! What irks me is the $12000. for varnishing the shutters! And no one asked our opinion! - Mouchot can biII us for that? - It's outside maintenance! He can legally biII us for repairs, maintenance, everything! No improvements! "This list is not aII-inclusive nor restrictive". We must end this type of lease! Yes, but how? Quiet! Quiet, please! Last month's charges were doubled with no justification! The super showed me a list of "costs" but it was Greek to me! They do that on purpose! They force us to figure out a ratio of charges, that aren't in the lease, while deducting garage costs! - Easy! - For a math prof! Each month I pay my share of the parking charges. I don't even have a car! We phoned the National Tenants' Committee. which is a sort of tenants' union. They said to go check Mouchot's books We set an appointment. for Wednesday. At 3:00! Mouchot's clever! Don't be a defeatist! It won't backfire? With that attitude. What can we lose? I need 2 more volunteers. We can't We work. I have a class Wednesday. Can't you change? If it weren't for my class. I'll go. Mrs Joffroy! Now 1 more! Mrs Descombes? I'm too old. Besides, it's not for a woman to do! If my wife's going. I'll go too. Who's your wife? 'Night, everyone! Who's reliable? Muzard! You hit the mark! I teach math. I'm in spatial anthropology. Uau! - Your husband? - Marcel's an optician. I have my own store. Anyone. care for a last drink? No, I have a class at 8:30 AM. You're no fun! - People'll complain to Mouchot! - They already have! I don't have a phone. May I use yours? Sure! - Over there Coffee? - Don't bother! It's just instant! We're neighbors? I'm glad. The ex-tenants had a dog. and left it alone every night. The poor dog would whine tiII 2 AM. Dogs need caring for. WeII, I never bark. Mouchot's line's busy. It's busy aII the time. Like "Dial-a-Friend"! Mr Mouchot, please. Bernard Rougerie. It's about Mr Baraduc. WeII, I'll caII later Thanks. Sit down! He's never in. I sent 4 letters about the shutters. The $12000 really hurt me! It was time for action! Our charges have gone up $300! Due to "auditing"! I'm writing a film. Mind if I give the hero your name? Joffroy? Long as he's not a jerk! He's a nice guy! Antoine Joffroy. May I caII my wife also? Cocktails are better with Martinil We got a problem. Come in! All that is. My film. What's it about? I wish I knew. A comedy? Not really. Hard work, huh? We're only 4 now to check the books. Joffroy's wife Dani?le can't get away. If you could come. just for 2 or 3 hours, it'd be a big help. - It's broken. - Take 2 halves! Supermarket super-sales! Don't you hear them? I hear them best in the bathroom. I'm out most of the day. Can you come? We should leave now. Our appointment's at 3. WeII I was working. Yes it'll do me good. Don't do that. You'll scratch the lenses. - Hello! - You're first? Cause I'm out of work! You saw? "News need not be exact, only huge!" We live in a great age. - It scratches. - But it's nice. No smoking, please. Mr Bricard wiII see you. Print your names in capitals. Are they cops? - I've no pen. - I got one. "Purpose of Visit"? Teatime at Mouchot's! Make-up? Strawberry "lip-glaze" to seduce Bricard! Can we smoke here? I don't understand. What's this item? Incredible! Muzard! The last quarter... 462 lightbulbs and 123 fluorescent tubes! The quarter before. 520 bulbs! The garage door was hit 8 times in 2 years by supermarket trucks! Each repair was billed to us. $3000 in aII! - It was insured! - So were the trucks! So the insurance covered it. Who got the money? Mouchot! - Swindler! - A good name for him! He seems to be a nosey one! Hello. Yes, I'll be there at once. Why should we pay the super? Mouchot makes us pay. his rent. and even his laundry! Then what are our rents for? Pure profit! How's that? All of this is on top of the rent! Like paying for a dinner and being told to pay for use of the silver, a new chef's hat and hormones for chickens. All that's in the biII! Cool it! - You here? - Quite a while! Oh, I worked and took notes. Sorry The files took longer than expected. - Where'd I...? - In your coat! You read it? I don't know if I'll do it. I don't feel it. I see what you're after. but I've no talent for that. If I had, I'd write novels! See. I'm good at adapting a novel. or doing a re-write. This is more than that! I've known you for 10 years. I know you can do it! You'll change your mind. Want to have dinner with us? That's very kind but. Your friend too! I'd love to. But unfortunately. the stores are open late tonight. I see. But you can come. I must work, so I'll have to leave early. Around 8:30 is fine. See you later! - What stores are open late? - Guess! Can't you set the story in the provinces? In Paris, you get lost. In the provinces, things are. more defined. You're stuck in a dreary milieu. The thing is dreary. A provincial industrialist, a bit uptight. is more interesting. There's a whole context. Neighbors, reputation, fear of scandal! It's not as snobbish. It's more vital! I'd set it in St Etienne. St Etienne! No doubt about it! What happened? It's broken again. I saw Mr Pezet, on the 5th floor. He's backed out. - Why? - No ideia. Hey! Santa just pinched my behind! Pinch his! Dirty old man! - Broken again? - As usual. - Do we fix it? - Let's eat first. - Give me a hand. - I'll take it. Found a job? I hope "smaII" is ok. Not bad! Can't see my big tits. It's odd but. being unemployed, I feel dirty! I spend hours cleaning and washing. Before, I didn't give a damn! I've met a very handsome guy. Who, you bitch? He's rented a place here to write a script. Rougerie. He did Deathwatch. Yeah, it wasn't bad. A bit too sweet. I prefer Ferreri. You can't compare them. Why do you like him? He's odd. and doesn't know it! - You used cinnamon? - Yeah. I didn't remember if you or Dad liked it. I ate too much. It was so good. I have time to cook now. - You have a cold. - It's my sinuses. I hope you take care of it. We'll do the dishes after we have coffee. StiII get your pension? They even raised it! From $174 a month to 184. 184! I can't help you just now. I don't need a thing. Oh, yes! A lump of sugar! - Is it Joel's? - No, Joel left. His parents moved. I keep only 4 children now. I don't know if it'll last. They may build a day-care center. They've been saying that for 5 years. Look what I found. Pictures. Old pictures. Look at that! That one's pretty. Better put it out. Remy took it. You look sneaky. I was a good girl then. Anne saw her mom each Sunday since her dad died. in a construction accident. Like many in her area, she was rehoused in the suburbs by builders who kill Paris with office space in place of playgrounds. It's more lucrative. Anne was a bit afraid of her mother's gentleness. Often she didn't know what to say. So she took her presents to show her she still loved her. Very good. Can I talk to Fr?d?ric? Darling, the lady wants to talk to you. Too warm? - I'll see him alone. - Why? To get to know each other. What'll you do to him? Just chat a bit. He won't talk. He's so shy! I was a bit that way. He cries easily. I'm a bit worried. If I need you, I'll caII you. Outside. I'll be just outside! Don't be afraid! I'm here! An eviction notice! Mr Rougerie too. Come in. Muzard and Joffroy too. I'll caII them. Bye, Marcel. You got one? Probably aII 5 of us. We'll camp under a bridge! Some wine? Yes, thanks. You didn't read it. It says: "As of today, the premises must be vacated." Sure! We checked the charges. Mouchot's being defensive. - He has no right to do it. - He has every right! It's mostly intimidation. What'll you do? - Calling who? - Muzard. We'll write to Mouchot tonight. I'm too busy! - Damn! - Never mind. I'm sorry. But I have so much work just now. I know about being kicked out. I lost my job. Lots of friends have, too. But we mustn't panic. I'm not panicking! But lawyers, summonses, red tape It's too much! We'll teII Mouchot you're not involved. - But I am! - Then help us. "It is clearly an act of retaliation." "Retaliation"... that's good. "And it is illegal." "We trust your decision is..." It needs rephrasing. "We trust" is too. "We dare to hope your decision..." "We dare to hope..." "Decision" is no good. Bullshit! Measures! No good either. It's not a measure. We used the word. There's another word. It's on the tip of my tongue. - Initiative? - Initiative! That's good. "We dare to hope. "to hope your initiative was impulsive and. "that you wiII reconsider..." "reconsider..." - You come after it's over! - I had a ceII meeting. We're sending Mouchot a hot letter! Seen the paper? "77 Evictions". It mentions us too, especially you. That's my pal. Another trick! Mouchot's evicting them too! - Contact them! - We're to see them tomorrow. But elsewhere. - Who're we to meet? - Boucher Head of the group. We'll meet others too. Good organization! Not like us! Books by children. "He plays sweet tunes to put his new friend to sleep." Is this keeping you from work? No, I've been dried up for 2 days! We go? Boucher's on the 5th? He's down the haII. That must be him. - Mr Boucher? - Yes. - What happened? - A suicide. One of our friends. took some sort of patent medicine. 200 pills. She's dead. She left a letter. with a P.S. saying she wants no flowers, nor her boss at her funeral. "Maybe some lilacs or lilies." It's what she said. The police are taking her away. We'll come another day. Life goes on, doesn't it? The others are waiting for us. Life goes on! Other groups came. Fabre and Jarry want to meet you. You must prepare an accurate file on aII complaints and your overaII situation for the press conference. It'll be on the 8th. Want help? No, they're just formalities. From rue Pinel? I'll introduce you. A girl. she killed herself. Mr Jarry and Mr Fabre. The Pinel group. Mr Rougerie? I saw the newspaper story. Your name is a help to us. You'll talk at the press conference. Nice place, huh? If only aII buildings. A law exists but it's not enforced. We took it over. It was tough to get even the leftist press. Low-income housing interests them more. Middle-income leaves them cold. - Is your group political? - Not very it's mixed. Politics would lose us half the group. That's the problem. People shy away from politics. Landlords think we're dangerous leftists. Big group? 29! But only 12 have paid. EnroII more! Use tracts, posters, anything! - Skiing? - No, parking. - You beat Mouchot. - 3 years ago. He'd charged us for building costs. He hasn't paid us yet. Then how can he evict you? He put a new clause in the lease. - Those who refused it Out! - Incredible! We must I don't know. - Appeal! - The city! - Denounce him! - The inquiry was stifled. He's landlord, insurer or manager of over 800 buildings in Paris, and on the board of several finance companies. You think a press conference wiII bother him? We must speak out. People don't know their rights. So they give in! It's a start. I'd throw a bomb! 200 pills. It takes time to down 200 without stopping. A sip of water after each one. In front of the bathroom mirror. Seeing yourself die. All that water must make you want to puke. She must've eaten too. It couldn't be shown in a film. It'd drag on. I'm going crazy here. Let's try here. I dream of making a film. about Marius Jacob. He was an anarchist thief. at the end of the century. He stole to aid anarchists. He was jailed and escaped 12 times, I think. What interests me is. after he was freed. The last days of his life. He sold oilcloth in the markets of the North. He feII in love with the wife of a friend. He told him: "I'd like to sleep with your wife." They were aII close friends. so the woman went to his place. Next day, he saw her home and killed himself. leaving her a letter. "I've had a fuII life. "and the joy of ending it with such beauty. "I consider my destiny fulfilled. "I've lived, I can die. "My laundry is washed and dried. "But not ironed. Sorry. I put 2 bottles on ice. To your health!" Marius Jacob! That restaurant we went to. Is it open? Today I'm inviting you to my place. - WiII it be good? - No. Disgusting! We're having couscous. Joffroy and Muzard are coming. Come, or I'll be eating couscous for days. Ok? It's a deal! It may kiII us but who cares! Mouchot brought us together! Catherine, how are you? Did you send the insurance form? You forgot? How could you? Can't you do things right? I'm flabbergasted! So do it! He's on the phone! A slide show? Great! And the slides? Sit to the side. There's plenty to drink! Help yourselves! You're in films, so you'll appreciate this. Lights out! That's to focus. It's pretty! I made a mistake! That's Carnac last summer. The famous rows. But with that angle. You stiII see the rows! That's Van Point. V- A-N, not V-E-N-T. An old Breton word. That's Raz Point. Remember the cold, dear? Freezing in August! As cold as July last year! We sure are lucky! Spanish Point! I sure know my points! That's Auvergne. - A bit out of order. - Millevaches! The plateau. That car. It's my Renault. I'm a Renault man to the end! Too bad. So was my cousin tiII one killed him! Not very funny. Upside down! That's Tunisia. We saw it before. Honey, you got 'em out of order! What's that? That does it! To bed! Get to bed! - She's been good! - Enough's enough! You won! It's aII over! Marcel, come be an elephant for her! And for us too? I do everything! There's no good films nowadays. What's a "good film"? It's good, from A to Z! And funny. At $3 a throw! After work, I want to have a good time. That guy never sees a film. Then says nothing's good! I know at least 20 films worth seeing. Hi, Mat. Not tonight. I'm with a neighbor. I'll caII you tomorrow. Yes. No, not yet. Maybe. Silly! So long! A friend. I met him when I had a job. Doing what? I was with a publishing house. working on art books. - Fired? - What? They fired you? Yes. A personnel cutback. The youngest were the first to go. Not very cheery! Not very cheery! Embarrassed? Should I be? I don't know. Here we are. HeII, help me! Say something! - What if I don't? - I'll feel really stupid. Let's go for a walk. Do we have to go the same way around? I don't mind. but we could change. - I like to walk. - So I see. I don't want to do it just 'cause. we've nothing to discuss. I've slept with guys that way. Out of laziness. And that. Oh, heII I want to! It's busy. It's not easy to teII a girl she makes love weII. You don't have to flatter me. I mean. That's no way to talk. I've been to bed with worse! So have I. Let's go recruiting! - How much? - No, let me. $2. Want to caII again? It's not worth it. Let's go. Yes, I understand. Come back when my husband's here. He takes care of that. But you can make a decision too, for once. You're as involved as he is. Aren't you? I'm not used to it. We'll come back. Marriage, marriage. Doing aII right? Here! You go first this time. We're the Tenants' Defense Committee. You know about it! I saw in the elevator. WiII you join our committee? We're foreigners with temporary visas. But it's not dangerous. Eviction would be serious for us. You understand The visa. We are glad to be here. I understand. - I'm sorry. - It's aII right. I see his point. We got one. But the doctor. You were phoning your wife? Yes. I'd like to see your script. Why? - It's no good. It's very trite. - I doubt it. It's worthless. What're you doing? A lady said you were recruiting. Doing ok? - Hello. - Hello, miss. Do we work? Yes. But they're evicting me. We checked the charges! - What is it? - Hello. We've formed a tenants' committee and. I'm only the painter. Just make him sign. - Sorry! - No harm done. Door to door! Best way to study the human race, isn't it? You put a cafeteria in the town. - What's it for? - WeII to go eat. You serve yourself. Not served by others. It's no fun to be served by others? Better to take what you want. - Because you can choose. - Yes. But you put in a restaurant too. Yes. That's for. for the others, for the Princess' people. The "Special Princess Restaurant." - Reserved for Her? - Yes, sort of. For instance, those field-workers there. can't go in? No. Only the people with cars. You mean who have money? The cafeteria is better for me. I like it. - You prefer it? - Yes. Why do you prefer it? The people are nicer. Yes, they are. - What do I see there? - The school. It's tiny 'cause schools are bad. But you put a huge sign on it. Yes, to show where it is. Over the restaurant. - You don't like schools? - No. Wait, I'll help you. Patrice is upset. My guy. What's wrong? He can't stay on the committee. His boss heard about the eviction, our group. It made a bad impression. Last year they fired a man who had cancer. He wrote Mouchot. He can't help it. Jobs are scarce now. Slow elevator! ShaII I go see him? Don't bother. He went to see Bonfils. - He was so upset! - Sure, I see. I found a map of St Etienne. and a lamp. Good! At last. I heard a great line the other day: "How odd the Berlim cemeteries are colder than anywhere else." That's great. But I don't know where to fit it in. I got an ideia on changing the beginning completely. At the start, we cut out the woman in the police station saying Antoine's disappeared. That was never any good. So, listen. Antoine is alone in his car. on a country road. And he gets stopped. There's been an accident. So he gets out. He gets out just to take a look. A schoolbus has fallen into a ravine and burned: 40 kids! Any dead? HeII, I don't know! Listen. It's an accident! Maybe some are dead. The accident is what counts. We'll get to the dead later. They're removing the bodies. Antoine is watching. Then there's. a cop who recognizes him and starts talking to him. Antoine is scared since he's trying to go. He runs off! We see aII his fear during his escape. That's good Very good! Especially showing the cop. who takes us back to the woman. I don't know yet. It's the accident. Maybe some are dead. Look There's an accident. Antoine Fear. Antoine's fear. Accident! Antoine! Fear! You get it? It figures. We've worked for at least 2 minutes. Joffroy needs you. Yes, but can't you see I'm working? It's for the press conference. It's in 2 days! I can't come now! I came here to be alone. Come see me when you want some hanky-panky. She seems to be hot for you! Did you? You're falling like a big, wounded animal. I didn't last 2 days. What a rotten office! No talking during work. No unions allowed. And the mentality! A yellow pass just to go piss. Pink if you have your period. Everyone knows when you need a tampax. I'm not joking. It was so humiliating! We can't get together before? Ok. Yes, I'm fine. Bye. Sorry about before. It was the middle of a scene. It may look like fun, but it's work. Want some rice? Yes, I would. I had an ideia for the press conference. I like "What happened?" For the press, it's dramatic! Not bad. Is it good? Where do you eat? You go home? Once in a while. I took this place to be alone. So I thought! Does your wife mind? I would, if I lived with a guy. It's good salad. I can't understand. loving someone and yet. wanting to sleep with someone else. Isn't it cheating? - Are you? - Cheating? Yes, I'm cheating your wife. I don't want it to happen to me. - That's pride. - I know. But it's how I feel. A tangerine? I can be a bore with my questions. Anyway, your pal's awful. He's really ok. Very intelligent and inventive. Maybe a bit odd with women. Odd? Sex-starved is more like it. What's this book? "The Crispougne." Written as if by a 7-year-old boy. About death, sex, the Pope. Let's see it. "They say men can't put their pricks in pussies. "if the prick's soft. "It has to be hard to go in. "It's easy to make it hard. "What do men do? "They dip Dickie in a glass of water. "and count to 3. "Then they say: titi-tou. That usually gets it hard. "If not, they keep repeating "titi-tou-dickie. "Then it's hard for sure." I took a long time to learn. At first, I felt nothing. Slightly excited, but barely. So I just pretended. But I could make myself come alone. Then. I met a guy interested in what I felt. So we talked. I told him how I came. He asked me to show him. I did it because. I liked him and. it excited me too. That changed everything. I did the same with others. Even if it shocked them. I played with myself. I came in front of them, not after they'd gone. And then, I felt more and more. I could wait and enjoy the pleasure. One day. I came without touching myself. It was fantastic. Someone else gave me pleasure! It knocked me out! But it's not easy. It's an effort. You have to want to. I'm sure it's not the only way. No one talks about that. We always think that coming is simple. Then girls think they're frigid if they don't right away. At first, I watched you come. I wasn't sure. Your eyes were shut. I like seeing them. - Don't you? - Yes, but it makes me giggle. Is it good with your wife? It's not the same. After 20 years, it's not what keeps us together now. There are other things. I wonder. after 20 years with the same guy. what I'd have to say to him. That scares me. Yet I can't bear living alone. If we tire of each other, we must stop. And if only one tires? Tough luck! Bernard wrote all day. Then Anne took him to a restaurant. The owner was an ex-army officer, bandit, soccer player and gold prospector. who loved to discuss raising children. Anne began to wonder if she could raise the kids she yearned for. She almost cried. Bernard didn't notice. So she told him about her last lover. Love doesn't exist. Only economic relationships. What about us? Our economic relationship is stable. What do you do for me? I screw you weII, teach you things. And I've awoken your political conscience. Coffee, please. Here, de Gaulle had his 1st meal in Free France. I see your problem. I'll surprise you. I even support your struggle. But believe me, defense groups are out-of-date. Old guns. Let's be more effective, more subtle. First, don't question Mouchot's good faith. Is he guilty? No. It's best to send him a letter. I've prepared one. "Dear Sir, the evictions must be a misunderstanding. "We do not challenge your management." Excuse me. May I ring you back, dear? "...challenge your management. We only wished explanations "for what seemed to us to be very abnormal figures." No, I'm too harsh. Cancel the "very". Any questions? Now that the TV nonsense is over, maybe we can get to work. As I understand it, you asked us here because your rents are too high. Also about the increases based on the national index, including items already paid off. Building materials, salaries. For old buildings, it's sheer robbery. The construction year should be the reference, using a mason's wages in 1830. The cost of stone in 1870. The rent includes construction costs and land value. The index for the annual increase applies to them both, meaning the capital of the land increases in value and is indexed for the good of landlords, not the tenants, who pay twice! Land value must be omitted from rent figures. You have 45 seconds to answer. Ready? Action! Rougerie Take 1! You're a weII-known director. Your recent film, A Woman at her Window. No, that's a Granier-Deferre film. Cut! I'm mixed up. You zoomed in? Let's do it again. Action! Take 2! Is there a link between your work as a director and your role in the tenants' group? Yes, in that. Shit! Cut! I ran out of tape. Le Nouvel Observateur came? No, neither did Le Parisien Lib?r?. They never do! L'Humanit? wiII. How's it going? Pierre! The girl Antoine meets can live in a building like this one. I don't agree. It's too classy. The people are too smart. She should be in one of those future suburban slums. A rabbit hutch where they pile the old, poor and useless. In buildings built after 1948 rent is de-controlled. The tenants are like the workers. They are. moved around, exploited, evicted. But they have to pay and pay. It's a degrading urbanization. Wash your hands! Don't dirty the cushions! They're stiII eating! It's very simplel I'm evicting some tenants who won't pay their rent. Not pay our rent? These events are due to a minority of hysterical tenants. What a nerve! I proposed a settlement. What a liar! There's Briette! We understand the tenants'problems but the landlords must face economic costs. He's head of city housing. We hope to solve the case correctly. However, it is an isolated case. We wanna watch TV! No more! Go brush your teeth! A scotch? My place? Your place? Sophie, say goodnight! Not tonight. I don't want it to become a habit. Besides. I dislike the way you asked. How should I ask? That's wild! One day it's "Let's fuck" and then. A man screws when he wants to and no one says a word. - The scotch! - Thanks. I forgot the ice. Why do you caII it a habit? I really want you! ANTOINE TAKES NO RISKS Ma, I'm not yelling. I'm just fed up! You're the one to yeII! There's nothing on us in Le Parisien. - Hi, Anne! - Patrice! Nice coverage! We're in Le Figaro, Liberation and Le Quotidien. That party at Fabre's. - Can we come? - Sure! Thanks Bye! I wanted to make love last night. You should've come over. I wasn't in. I slept at home. That's life! I'm off to a job interview. - I wish you'd read our script. - Whenever you want. I was unable to sign in for unemployment last week. That's bad. You could lose your rights. It's the 1st time! What if everyone was like you? It's not that hard to come every two weeks. Besides, you have nothing to do. That's not true! I look for work every day. How much do you need? $100. My unemployment check's late, but it'll come soon. Enough? Yes. Sure you can spare it? Thanks. You came by car or subway? By bus. The subway's depressing. That's where you see how bad things are. It used to be empty. Now it's fuII of people looking for jobs or killing time. One day a guy sat down and cried. So I stay near the door. I'm afraid. Let's make a little basket with a handle. Then we'll see what's inside. You can make a bigger one. You know how. Use a bigger piece. Like the feel of clay? ShaII we go on? We'll make the basket. Do the next one. What's happening here? It's a real party! Why are you here? Are you interested in housing? It's not my profession. but I'm a tenant myself. in one of the buildings you saw. There are 2500 evictions. I'm one of them, so I'm directly involved. I'm trying to understand and help the other tenants. How? Doing what? For now, we'll use legal measures. But that may change. We could go on rent strikes or stop paying abusive charges. We'll pay what we truly owe. We could have exhibitions. Set up ping-pong tables, organize games. This could be a playground instead of a forbidden lawn. There should be a nursery. At least! Mouchot has arrived! Put down Mr and Mrs Haynneman. With 2 n's. And your name, Madam? - Mrs Laroque. Why? - Fine! Put it down. A table, lanterns. Banners. Orangeade, limeade, lemonade. Lots of alcohol: whiskey, gin. Folks, it's Mr Mouchot! A bandstand. The Press wants to know the point of this. No comment. A 5-man band. We'll get their names. What's this aII about? Come onl Mr Mouchot's herel Is this a nursery school? Don't answer. Keep going. WiII you file charges? When vandalism takes over the result is inevitable! You got a great job! What's next? Watching an adultery? Wanna dance? Note this attack! I once knew a girl, I was in remedial class. because. I'd lost my father. She was the kind of girl for whom nothing worked. She was 14, 2 years older than me, but backward. I remember one day, she said she'd like there to be a war. We started discussing war. We asked if she was afraid of being killed. Know what she said? "I'll never have a good life so..." If I'm boring you, say so. - I can repeat aII you just said. - I bet! Listen, Anne. It's not my fault. At times. I think about my script. I'm to start shooting in 3 months! A rich man's worries! What's that mean? You rate worries. on earnings? No worries above $1000 a month? - That's crap! - It's the truth! Your problems are a luxury! You sound like a Girl Scout! You feel guilty! Shit! I'm sick of your moralizing! Schmuck! - Rue Pinel! - I'm headed home. Shit! Why didn't I take my car? I'm a fool! Don't laugh at me! - Why be so aggressive? - To save time. Life's too short for games. You're silly! What does your wife do? She treats kids who have trouble speaking. Who won't talk. A year ago, they gave her a 6-year-old. He'd barely spoken in months. She tries to find an opening. Once she had a 5-year-old girl who had no appetite. I saw her. At 5, she was as light as a new-born baby! And so thin! She was fiercely determined not to eat. She's lucky to do that. Jobs rarely make you feel. really useful. And children are. so often hurt, spoiled. A fine job! Catherine. I often envy her. because. she deals with real life. Truly concrete! It's odd. I feel you really stand. solidly behind her. But. I can't see why. you lie to her. What shocks me most is the time you don't share with her. Not telling her everything. Whenever I did, she was hurt. Maybe she doesn't want to know. Come on, Bernard! And there are things one likes to keep secret. You don't trust her enough. How can you say that? How do you know? If you ever live long with a man. I'd never be able to. I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. You have so much inside you. So much to give. But just now. Being unemployed and aII. It's tough on you, hein? You take it aII so seriously. Why are you saying this? You think it can help? YOU TAKE NO RISKS HOUSING TO HOUSE US! NOT TO EVICT US! DOWN WITH EVICTIONS HAPPY IN THIS DORMITORY CITY? We demand: Rights, Fair Rents, Securityl CANCAVA LANDLORD EVICTS. 36 FAMILIES What are you doing? That's too much! You're insane! What got into me? - What's going on? - I got a fantastic ideia! Fantastic! Can I come in? You know what time it is? You're going to yeII. Think before you react. Antoine is now a woman! - In drag? - No, you schmuck! Where? - What's that? - A pine tree. I see! But what's it for? For your kids' Christmas. They're on vacation with Mariette. - Alone? - No, I am not! It doesn't matter. - What's this "woman" ideia? - It's simple! A woman leaves her husband and kids. It's more brutal! She then meets a guy. We reverse the roles! But the same story! I got it! The wife leaves. She suffers. Very contemporary! I'm not joking! Ok, you've had a great ideia. Really fantastic! So leave the tree, go home and we'll work tomorrow. And I'll finish what I was doing. I want to see you. I'm thirsty. Water? No thanks. I'd like to sleep alone. Why? It can't go on like this. We're not close enough. Here we go again! I didn't go looking for you! I don't regret a thing. I opened myself to you and thought you'd do the same. But nothing. You don't feel I need you? Can't you see that. you motivate me. You help me? Don't you see how I've changed? I don't want a total break-off. I'd like us to be friends. But. Like tonight! You come and ring. I'm only to wait and open up. I don't want that. It hurts me to say it. but I want to change many things within me. and around me. I'm afraid you'll stop me. - We were happy just now. - Yes. No. The little girl opens all her body to show me all her hearts on a display rack transparent and luminous as soda water. Yellow, the color of her heart that gushes blood all over. Blue, the color of imagination and dreams. Green, the color of the future. Red, the color of desire that beats faintly. Blue again, the color that pounds on the beach. Mauve, the color of love. Green is her woman's heart that. that hasn't yet begun to throb. Yellow means fleeting love smiling by half-opened doors and overpowering perfumes and making hearts pound. Transparent white is love's extra heart, turning to rust. Ok? No, Miss Batuchon! A dog bit me. - With rabies? - No Why? Ladies and gentlemen. I'm announcing a delay for your eviction. It was a misunderstanding. My secretary's error. She often makes such errors? The subject is closed. Of course, your tactics. Meetings on my premises! The newspapers. I'll overlook aII that. I've cancelled your eviction notices. What about the charges? Bulbs, electricity, garage door? No garage electricity wiII be charged. See Bricard about the rest. It's fine. You recognize the defense committee? It's out of the question! I deal only with individuals, not committees. Our demands are precise. Interest is to be paid on rent deposits. You're joking! And no evictions without legitimate cause such as damages or unpaid rent. I'll never give in on that! So put in the lease your right to evict us for any wild reason! Stop joking! I have enough problems with pre-war buildings. I might need one of my apartments. Say I want to house a cousin of mine. You'd evict someone? You heard what you said? What if I'm at a restaurant and the owner says. "I need your table at once for my cousin. Get out!" A ridiculous comparison! You live where you wish. I rent to whom I wish! A worker's family has 3 months to find a home, on a salary of $400 a month, and you have 800 buildings! Let's go on. Rent hikes are based on the national index. That's the best way. The latest index is up 22%? Right! The Department of Finance asked for rents to increase by 7% only. They asked! But it was a request, not an order. They don't run my business. I make my own decisions! What if the government changes? Elections are soon. If the leftists win, I'll seII everything. If the right stays in, nothing wiII change! They'll talk and talk and I'll do as I please! Son-of-a-bitch! "I'm like a dive-bomber: right on the target." We made some gains, no? Do we caII a meeting? Not tiII Monday. It's the weekend. Our world of country hideaways! Drop me off at work? Ok. See you on Monday! - Your car? - Over there! Sad? Why should I be? No reason. Julien told me. It's great! - The little girl talked? - Yes. Today. Not even a sentence. But I felt she wanted to talk to me. TeII me. How do you keep on top of it aII? I go slowly. And when you're hurt? I'm hurt. You changed the script? I've really got it now. The film wiII be. more violent. I want to use what you wrote about the child. The child in the park. The knife story? When it hurts too bad, Mama, I'll lie down in the grass. I'll take a little knife and stick it in my heart. No, you won't, darling. One day it'll hurt so bad, you'll know there's no help. You'll take your knife. Tears will stop. Everything inside you will stop. But you'll stand up. Excuse me Hello! Take the chairs. I'll get the phonograph. - Can you wait? - Sure! - What's up? - I'm moving. My rent's too high here. I'll live with a girlfriend. - Where? - In Ivry. Found a job? With a cosmetics company. I cut out press clippings. It's terrific! - Got a phone number? - Yes. Got a pencil? Isa, got a pen? Just teII me. I have a good memory. 930.39.46. 930.39.46. Easy! '39 was the war, 46 is my age. You never told me that! And your film? It's ok. I'm editing it now. I think it's good. You'll caII me? Of course. Try to shake them up a bit. Without me, they're in trouble. WeII. Goodbye. - I got aII day! - It's ok. One day it'll hurt so bad, you'll know there's no help. You'll take your knife. Tears will stop. Everything inside you will stop. But you'll stand up and smile at your friends. You'll greet your teachers and use your knife to sharpen a pencil. At first the lead will break often. But soon you'll know how hard to press. It will all be like that till you become a man like the rest, bruised so badly, they're numb. If I die one day, I want to meet death As I have met love.
