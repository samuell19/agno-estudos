Final BG slingback at a 47 OTC. All green moon spacecrafts, pickup and turnaround. This will be our final pass around the green moon. I repeat: central BG line is discontinue in service. Strap up, sit tight and slingback. Subtitled by NILNUWAN Where were you? I... just stepped out. I told you not to leave. Well, I couldn't sleep. I don't get help... like you do. Clean it, please. Scrub the filters. In the schedule says that this is the last run. The line is shutting down. M-hm. You.. didn't tell me that we could be stranded. We won't. We've three cycles for the job before we've to catch the slingback. Plenty of time. Clean the thrower. You look like your mom. I need yo to- Your mother, broke her water... before you were supposed to come. On Lau islands. We didn't think you could come so early. - I didn't know that. - You were tiny. I had you in my hand. You were just red and furious, fussy and... covered in hair. I was born on Lau? I thought we lived in camaria. You know, when we were on holiday. It was our last holiday before the baby came. We should go back. - You can't swim. - No. - You have to swim in Lau. - Back home. The camaria. Cavaria. You don't even know how to say it. It's not our home. It's where we lived with mom. Ah..we're going to... We're going to be out of this.. ...soon, and get out of We've got our jobs, it's just, you know, it's temporary. I'm sorry. I haven't tell you. I should've told you. Tell me what? Hey. Three cycles? M-hm. 2742, requesting release. Restart, 2742. Be advised, BG pivot is for pickups only. I know. I know the line is dead. We'll be back on the other end. What was that? Oh, shit! That's atmosphere. Come on! Oh! Oh! Come on! God! What happened? I don't know. We were off course. Here. Find out where we are. We needed a cycle... now we have a half a cycle to harvest. This piece of shit put us out of range We're here. - Right here? - Hm. Let's suit up. Wwhat about the instruments? We're just burned out one of the gels, it's fine. We still have enough time. We need to move out now, though. We'll already be late. Clear? Clear. Alright, you've got the good filter. But watch your saturation. Here. You do it. I need to keep hands on the thrower. It's an old aurelac dig. Leftovers from the rush. On my last tour, the forest was full of these little crank teams. Not many of them knew what they were doing, got pretty scrappy. Do we have time for this? This is amateur work. They might have left something behind. Bring me the kit. And the water. Hold it. You want to cut it? Yeah. Okay. Alright, right here in the middle. Good. Mix equal parts on the squeeze for the phaser. If the blister's punctured, it releases karum-acid. If it contacted with the gem, the whole pull is compromised. Hey! If the phaser touches meat, the whole dig blows. Be more careful. See it? That would have been a solid pull back in the rush that our deposite's gonna pull at least hecatron grade. But that will wreak-in at least a few thousand. Maybe even ten. Ten thousand? M-hm. Ten thousand would be enough to cover the loan. Right? A- And the pod lease. If we head back now, there will be enough time to make sure that we don't miss a slingback. Uh-uh. Why? Ten thousand gets us back to pugger- maybe half a stand, then we're scaning boards for the next one. - I like the pug. - You don't like the pug. There's deposit that have pinned, The queen's lair. It's very special. Gems that five times this size, maybe bigger. With only 15 points on the pull, our net gains could easily be in the millions. That's back to central kind of money. But..if we miss the slingback- This is not up for discussion! We will never ever have a chance like this again. I mean, we've been here too long and we've filled the bladders, we gotta move out. Someone's approching. It looks like two men, they're armed. Channel zero, mute your mic and stay in there. I'll meet you back on three when I get the chance. I only just arrived. Just passing through when I spotted this old dig. I'm curious. What? You guys need anything like a filter or some food? Don't see too many tubes around these woods anymore. Yeah, I caught word of the fade, couldn't resist one last quick job. I'm not a kid.. Or a retarded man. I cocked it up in the peak of the rush. - Where's he going? - Is that a serious question? I told you, I'd just arrived, I don't have anything. I believe you, temper man. But my partner always need something convincing. He'll just kill me, if I let you go without a thorough search. I never caught your name, friend. It's damon. Nice to meet you, damon. I'm Ezra. I can't tell you how refreshing it is.. ...ooh.. To encounter another talker. Its been quite some time since we've meet anyone with fluid in motion. Where're you from, damon? Nowhere. How poetic. I take it you're a..um.. Floater? Freelancer. You know, you don't look like one. - I need those. - Yeah, don't yell. I told you, I don't have anything. I'd just arrived. - Alright, damon. - You don't understand! Understand what, now? Damon, it has truly been a pleasure, but... pleasantries passed, it's time to get defensive. To be completly candid, this hole has proven to dissapoint me and my partner both feel we deserved... ...satisfaction. You understand? So, how did you get here, damon? Why? Your ship. Where is it? Or perhaps your ship is bit too risky when you're drop out, I rekon? Yeah. A pug. Shit me! The starters, if you don't mind. Where is it? Don't make me root for it, damon. I guarantee you, I'd make it an unnessecerily painful process. Get off. Get off! If I give you the key, you're just going to kill me. That is not neccesserily true. Nevertheless, continuing within the act of killing is a broadspectrum of technique. So there is still an incentive for you to act if that's where you're getting at. I have a counter-offer. - Huh! A twist? - M-hm. - Go on. - I'm not here for prospect. I'm here to harvest. Then why would be so cryptic under rails? You are lucky. I am not immune to intrigue. But be careful, you don't overplay this technique. I have the precise location of a massive deposit of aurelac. But my astimation its the largest enyone's ever seen. - I've seen my share. - The queen's lair. That's a theory. I've been hired by a crew of mercs, who have stumbled upon what they describe as a deposit, with size of a hopper turbine. They're here on some kind of prisoner escort, found the queen's lair accidently. Now they're camped on the site. They needed a digger, so I'm on contract to harvest it for a cut. But with the three of us, and that rail gun.. Couldn't we just take it off for ourselves? It's funny. I don't see any mercs. Where are they? I'm not gonna tell you, but I can lead you there. Okay. I'd like to believe you. Admittedly, more out of desire than good sense. But damon... if there is talk of the queens lair... ...the excitment is momentary. Even split. And there's a three of us. We split it in thirds. That's an even split. Fine. This is so exciting. Are you there? Yes. Okay, when we depart, get the thrower and follow up. But wait for me to channel check, when I do.. ...they should stop, when they stop fall in and target the big one. Remember, only one shot per cap. Clear? Clear? I need to hear it. Clear? Clear. What was it looked like, back in the day? - You've always went solo? - Family crew. We had a base camp orbiter. Fancy. We had a full crawling party when we arrived here. Not one of your freighter. A testing screamer. Mercs in the green, hah? last I heard the word "merc" was.. Way back when freebound raiders heat up all the corparate expeditions. They were hired by caero clan for one of their ceremony over executions. Caero clan? You friendly with these fellas? Nah, I'm.. These questions.. God damn it. Drop it! Drop it! Tell him to drop it! Drop it! Get back. Get back! You know, this is something I have never seen in all my time on the green. A little girl. Damon, I have clearly underestimated you, I must stop doing that. Alright. Drop the packs, both of you. Alright, sit down, right there. Damon.. Does this mean that the plan is off? You have me all up and bothered over the queen's lair, Damon. Huh. Open it. Alright, you can have your fabled spoils all to yourself. But if your talk of the queen's lair is true.. ...this is just a scratch. Dad.. - Can we go? - The girl looks scared. You should listen to her. No harm done yet. Open it. It's a shame, damon. We could've been rich together. You got a field-kit? Hey! Field-kit! Are you gonna shoot? You killed my father. That is... technically true. Can't but wait, girl! Shoot or help! Just make a move. Here's what is going to happen. You'll lead me to your ship and and fly me in to connection orbit for a slingback. In exchange for this, I'll not kill you. This is a good deal. You killed my father, so I'm being very geneorus. I suggest you take it, because I'll kill you otherwise and don't think that I won't. Get me a kit and we can talk. Your offer is indeed generous. You know, I'd be more than happy to sign and seal, safe for one glaring slip. My ship. You don't have a ship? Well. I did. Then there was an event with my crew concerned in a bit of aurelac and.. Words and metal flew. And now, I don't. We're in the same trough, you and I. - Whow! Whow. Just. just... Slow down a bit there, little bird. At least wait for the counter-offer. I don't think I should listen to you. How is it you intend to get home? That is the goal. - Am I right? - That's not - I'm not telling you. - The mercs. They're real, aren't they? M-hm. And the Queen's lair? M-hm. You were making a run for them. Listen, I know well the lure of vengence. I myself... frequently indulged, and I have not often found regret. But in this moment, right here... ...I'm afraid for both our sakes, I must repost. I say, we go to your mercs. I play the prospecter. And together we ravage the queen. You're trying to trick me? And I help you. I can harvest. I can offer protection. A girl of your age, a child, wanders into a camp of mercs. At the end of the tour what happnes? You appeal to their sympathies? They have none. They are ruthless propiteers. You must have something to offer or they will find something to take from you. Why should I trust you? You stole from us. - We did nothing to you. - That's the fringe, girl. If you're one to point fingers at extortion, well, there's not much I can say. And then you killed my father. Now, hold on. I'm keen to make the case that damon killed himself. We were trying to escape. He was trying to steal my thropy cases, what he was trying to do. A man's work is no petty thing. To you, his daughter.. ...I truly apologize for my contribution to his passing. But he was stealing my entire harvest. And actions like these foment the threat of appropriate reactions. Your Father knew that, and if didn't, then he had no business in the green. You're a killer. I am, indeed. But, are you? It was all in the name of self-preservation, birdie, it was nothing personel. Shut up. - I'm your safe - Shut up! And in the end we'll both be rich. Even split. Of course. There is one more thing. My filter's spent. I'm gonna need a hook-up. What is your name? Do you mind if I take a look? I can handle a map. You know about these mercs. When did they arrived? - How many are there? - I don't know. He didn't tell you anything? It's bad practice keeping you in the dark, if you ask me. What? It just doesn't suit you? A deep partnership is only made so by candid discourse. Like with your mute friend. Well, number two was more of a utility.. Than a partner. And it seems like your father treated you the same way. Stop talking about my father. What's your name? Well, I have to call you something. Oi, number 3. Alright, watch the tube, girl. Thank you. If you don't know the thing about tunnel rats, it's when they fornicate, they excrete a hormone substance, I don't know what its called, but it's uncannily sticky, it cocks up electrics.. And it smells exactly alike but significantly more potent than stale human urine. Could you stop? Anyways, we stripped.. ...every panel in that ship. We clubbed those rat beavers to death. It was a toilsome marathon of carnage. - You know, eventually, you're gonna have to trust me. Let's go. - What's wrong with you? - Just give me a moment. You should... keep the thrower low, we could be surrounded. - What? - I said, keep it low. - He's coming closer. - Don't show any sign of aggression. Drop it. - Put your hands above your head. - What? - Just do it. - Why? Just do it! Now! - We have to follow him. - Why? The wound appear.. Ideal bite. It still has some venom. The dust. It found its way in, and now it festers. They're religous settlers and tidious scavengers. They should be - trade for medical supplies. - We don't have time. - We don't have a choice. You don't. You shoot me, then. Who are you? I have sustained a wound, that's due to inadequate treatment, now festers pink. I was hoping you had some juice. We've got juice. Thank you, sir. We're tremendously greateful. No! No throwers. I thought perhaps it might interest you for trade. No.. Throwers! A wise and understandable measure. We'll just store them at our discretion and return shortly, unarmed. Is that acceptable to you and your collegues? Alright. Here. I was once a man like you, who came with the mind to strike aurelac. But that man died down there in the green. Born anew amongs friends, bonded in to lairs beyond the ability and started to percieve it. And now, our son will play for you. That was beautiful. Juice. It's good for you, it cleanses the dust. Thank you for your kindness. Now, as you can see, I have sustained a trauma to my shoulder. It would much like to flush it with your magic juice. And to keep straight... we would also be very much interested in proper dressing and filter refreshers, if you have them and can spare them. In return for your greacious offering.. We're prepeared to compensate.. ...with generosity in equal mesure. Here's our offer. I'm sorry, I don't understand. For the girl. That is a bold offer. It has been determined, you can't see it 'cause aurelac fills your eyes. But it is inevitble all the same that she will be reborn, just like me. That is the reason why you were brought here.. ...not aurelac. What do you need her for? We've lost our mother. It's time to rebuild. The commencer have felt our loss and pulled you here, to reclaim the balance. Hello! Hello to the green! Not so funny. It suggested mankind make a bad deal. If anyone's out there, don't hesitate to click on. Take your helmet off. You look like shit. Eat it. There is cases of 'em in here. Here. I need your help. After you left, those guys weren't too keen on helping me out.. So I had to treat myself. I botched the excision. I was unable to clean and scrape the blackness. Now if I don't lose my arm, it'll kill me. And I can't perform the procedeure by myself. Were you going to give me to them? No. You ever use one of these before? It's easy. Prime it like this, ...then there're five levels of intensity. 2 for flesh, 4 for bone. You got it? Thank you. Will it hurt? I won't feel a thing. Hack away. Quick.. Confident strokes our best. Try to go full circuit on the first cut. I've never had to use these before. Kind of nice... tingling, almost like Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit! - What? - Oh, shit. Oh, shit, oh, shit. - Does this hurt? - No. I don't know. Keep going, you're doing great. Keep going untill you hit bone. I'm gonna miss'em. My primary weapon, been with me my whole life. Alwaye there, ready to help. No job too greedy. No love..too intimidate. - Oh! - Sorry. Up to 4. let's finish it off. Give my stump a hardy coat of juice and cream it all shut. Clear? Clear. How are you so calm? You've done this before. I was twelve.. ...we spend a season prossessing meat. Once they choped all the big meat cuts.. ...they had me climbed inside the body cavity to clip the organs.. So I could get the eggs out without mangling them. It took an hour to wash the blood out of my hair every night. This is pretty straight, compared to that. Done. So, where is your home? I don't have one. You spoken like a true floater. What's that book you carry around? - It's "the Streamer Girl" - "Streamer girl"? It's a novel. - You wrote a novel? - No. No, I'm just writing it out. You really don't know the streamer girl? There's not a lot of literature in circulation out here. Oh. That's so good. Ilt's about this group of friends. They grew up together at the bausin conservatory in the ephraty. It follows their life to school, graduation and after. Chloe and Rave are my favorites. They end up- I shouldn't tell you, in case you read it someday. Well, it seems I must. It's my favorite. I lost my copy and I'm working on a new one. Um..I'm not done yet. - You memorized it? - Not the exact words.. But I know every scene. Sometimes.. ...I imagine that I would've been in the Ephrati with them. I like to think about what happens in between what's already been written. So I add new scenes sometimes, because then I get to spend more time in their world and It's like they were more real to me, like, ...like I can have conversations with them. - You must think I'm strange. - Not at all. It's quite impressive. When I lost the book, he said that it was for the best. He said that it was just a distraction, that I was wasting my time reading the same book, and that I needed a focus. - Focus on what? - Hm.. Cultivating skills related to my field. Maybe he was right. Maybe if I had then he wouldn't be dead. Oh boy, you can't... you can't think like that. It's not good. If you need someone to blame, you blame me. You need to think about your next move. My name is Cee. It's nice to meet you, Cee. M-hm. There's our ride. Stay clear and close when I talk us through. When it comes time to dig, I need you to be sharp. I've never harvested one handed before. I'm gonna need some help. But we'll keep it cleanly and it will all be fine. Damon, here for the dig. - I whole heartedly apologize for being late. But as the storm tidies us half the mark, we were already- You're late. I whole heartedly apologize. You wouldn't believe.. You ready to dig? Well, actually... before we get started, I'm afraid I must interject. I haven't been completly candid with you yet. After an erring landing and toilsome trick, there is one more significant detail to our story, one that forces us to leverage out talents for little bit more than the agreed upon price. 15 points. It's not more of a cut we're after. Points are more than adquate payment for the two of us, alright? It's means of transit we lack. We need a ride-up to the freighter. Can't help you. Then we're not going to dig. Well, yeah, what see means to say is that while transport is a requsite part of the deal, we're willing to forgo two points. Which by any rekoning is exorbitant compensation for a hop to the orbit. I said, we can't do it. Take off already peaked and we ain't putting your weight in payload. Oh, come now. In a prize.. Quite well over the weight of the passenger and a half. Cargo braces. That's one hundred, one thirty right there. Braces already been guarded. What about the water reservoir? She a rod chomper, Bad bones. - Engine skirt? A..a.. boss converter. How are we going to live with no converter? My farther once the spare battery and punch the orbit squares in the handpads of the pod- And now you're looking to talks what? The job hasn't changed, so keep your fifteen and get the digging before we miss the last train home. Your way off is not our problem. You're not understanding me. Everything is changed. If you're not willing to scrap payload, scrap crew for all I care, but you'll find a way, if you want that buried tresure. Anyone here's been looking for a way out. I rekon you'd best jump to it, if you trying to keep your pay and your girl. I am the gatekeeper to more wealth than any of you've ever seen and you've been wasting in the green for far too long to let that slip away. I'm afraid, I'm the only means to the successful end of your venture. And I say the terms have changed. 13, plus a ride for me and my partner on your handsome craft or no deal. Find a way. You know, I do not intend to breach my station but, perhaps the secondary hydrogen tank offers a survivable solution to this stalemate. One that will keep us all in pay. My boy, this is a win. I think a little back up thrust is an easy drop under the circumstanses. What do you say, boss? Fine. This way. Gentlemen.. And women... let's get rich. Strange method for an execution. What did this fella do to landing in the box? Don't know. he came to us packaged up in powder pink. Had to slog all the way out here just to leave him here to die. Apparently, It's a tradition. - How convoluted! - Don't need to tell me. But the pay is good, so I don't miss-care. There she is. Somebody ought to give her go. When we found it Our boy over there did it first. It ate his arm, so we called you in. That's the prize for a dry breach. But my chemo will calm it. Chemo, sweetheart. It's a big one. You've got it? Nice and tight. Hold it like you love it. That's perfect. Slippery son of a bitch. No, no, no. Shit! Not to worry, we go again. - - - You know how to do this? It's a little difficult to do it weak handed. What did you say? It sounded like you said you can't do this. - Now, hold on. - Wait, wait. Alright, you can't dig for shit. Finish them. Those shots will bring the rest of the men. What do we do? I don't know. Shit! Greedy fool! He knocked himself. Took a stumble, getting a closer look. Now, time's precious and I am gonna need assistance if we're- Go, go! Go! Over here! Over here! Move! I'm out. If we uncouple and you can run a distraction, I'll open him up with a backstab. Are you sure? I can do it. You run fast, and you don't stop. You keep playing the trees between you and her, you come straight back here as soon as I make the kill, so we can recouple. Are we clear? Clear. You need to go. You grab the gun and you go. You can make it. Get outta here!
