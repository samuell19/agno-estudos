- Time for your pills, Woody. - "The righteous shall rejoicewhen he seeth the vengeance. "He shall wash his feet inthe blood of the wicked "so that a man shall say, "Verily there is a reward for the righteous. "Verily he is a God that judges in the Earth." Psalm 58, Peter's favourite. "Let them melt away as waters. "We begin as dust and we end as dust." Please join me now. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. May he rest in peace. Amen. We are here to bidfarewell to Peter. A man about whom manythings could be said. To get a glimpse ofa man's character one need only look atthe company he keeps. - How disgusting! How could you? Spitting on adead man's coffin! What gives you the right? - Peter's last wish. Some chewing tobacco delivered on top of the box like baseball playersdo on television. - Oh, you mean like this? - Oh, funerals bring out thebest in us, don't they? Hi, I'm Olive McFarland. These fine relics here areWoody Laramee and-- - Joseph Blahacek. - Come Caroline.We're leaving. - Now who the hell are you talking to me like that? - Joseph is having usfor tea. Join us? He's not always a grouch! Come on, it'll be festive. Father, join usif you can! Come on! - Woody, you and I have someunfinished business here. - We do? - Yes, we do.The receipts. - Anybody home? - For the funeral. Just tell the people at yourhome to hand me a cheque. If I left it up to them, Peter would have beendumped in some old shoebox. - Gramps!Hey, everybody! - What's this? What the hell happened to you? - It's for my play. Romeo and Juliet. The S & M version. - Rose, this is Joseph'sgrandson, Max. - Rose Lear. Always niceto meet a fellow actor. - Pleasure to meet you. - Actor? Try bum. When is he going toget a real job? That's what I want to know. - Woody. Nice to meet you. Bye all. Thanks. - Don't forget thatmoney you owe me, Romeo. - Yes, well, what a lovely home. - We need a fourth for bridge. You interested? - I'll have to think about it. - Fine, no problem.We'll get someone else. - I've thought about it.I'd love to, thank you. - Oh, right. - We'll call you tomorrow. OK? Great! - By the way, Rose... Didn't I see yousomewhere before? - Yes, it's true! Even I get hemorroids. - That old TVcommercial, right? - That stuff doesn't work. - With you, I'm not surprised. Try prunes. - Attention! This meeting of the SunshineManor Facilities Committee is now in session! Order! Order, please! Order! Order, please! - You're the headof the committee! You should know when thewhirlpool will be installed! - We're looking into it! - That was 6 monthsago, wasn't it? - Well, not quite that. - Those plans for that new wingwere approved over a year ago. Just what is going on? - The committee has sat down on a number of occasionswith the administration but it does take time. - It's all talk! And no action! Just like the men around here! - Let's just get thatnew wing built, huh? I'm in a room for 2 thathas 4 people in it! And 3 of 'em snore! - I do not! - Oh yes, you do!- How the hell would you know? - Listen, I have a nice carpetthat I would like to sell. If anyone's interested I'llbe in my room from 8:00 on. It's a lovely carpet-- - That is not on the agenda. - Carl! Your father, he would not holdoff on these improvements. He loved this place. - Yes, he did, didn't he? But he's gone. And you don't look after thebooks around here anymore. I do. What's this? - Receipts. Peter's funeral. - Yes. Joseph Blahacek wants to bereimbursed from Peter's estate. - We would have taken careof Peter's burial ourselves. So you go tell Mr. Blahacek that unfortunately there isno money to reimburse him. - What? - You heard me. - Oh... You... You... What are youtrying to say, Woody? - If your father... - If my fatherwere still here this place wouldstill be in the red. And as far as Peter goes, thepennies he didn't drink away he kindly donatedto Sunshine Manor. And all of usare very grateful. Here. I'm sure itwas a lovely funeral. I have work to do. Go! - Well, I was born on theQuebec-U.S. border. In our house, thekitchen was in Vermont, and the bathroom was in Quebec. And when I die, I want my ashes spreadright at that border point. On my birthday. - Ate American foodand pissed in French. That's why you'reso screwed up. - I was born and raisedin Hoboken, New Jersey. Home of littleOld Blue Eyes himself. - Mother neverquite forgave you. - Something like that. - So, where's Fred? - I left him onmy 60th birthday and I became aprofessional actress. - Just like that! Women! - A problem with the femalegender. And no wife. - No, no. Don't say that. - Why not? - Because it's my house.I don't want to talk about it. - Is he always like this? - Oh yes. - Most of the time. - The rest is mine. - Yay! - Rose! - Maybe we shouldchange partners. - Oh, come on. It'sa penny a point. Peter was right,you are an old miser. Joseph Blahacek! - Speaking of Peter... Did you get a cheque for me? There's nothing. - Peter had no money left, OK? What little he had hedonated to the home. - He donated themoney to the home? I paid $4,000 for that coffin, and he donates the moneyto those cheap bastards! He was probablydrunk at the time. I'm not surprised. - Well, maybe we couldshare the cost. I could put in a thousand. - I could come up with... $500. - Woody? - Uh... well... I'll ask. - Who do you have to ask? - The home. - The home? - They take care of me. I get like, an allowance. - Allowance? - Woody? What's going on? - When I had my nervousbreakdown, I... I signed power of attorney. - Well, you just go in there andtell them you're feeling fine. And whatever you signed, yourip it up. It's your money! - I'll see. - I'm surprised at you! I didn't know youwere like this! You sound like a wimp! Boneless, spineless little wimp! - Joseph Blahacek! How can you speakwith such disrespect? Who the hell doyou think you are? - Nobody talks to melike this in my house. - I just did. What are you goingto do about it? - I pass. - It's past yourbedtime, isn't it? - Well, my workis never done. What can I do for you? - I want $1,000. - Really? Whatwould that be for? - It's my money. - I'll look into it. It's a significant sum. - But it's-- it's mine. - I'm well awarethat it's yours. But I'm looking out foryour best interests. Your investments havenot performed well. It wouldn't be a good time tosell. You'd lose a lot. - Well, maybe I... Maybe I should-- - Maybe you should what? Revoke my powerof attorney? Go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah, I didn't think so. It's funny, isn't it? The way the past comesback to haunt us? Good night, Woody. - Stand by, Olive.

No children? - No. - Ever hear ofOlso Industries Inc? - One of Sam's companies? - No, I don't think so. Sam died 12 years ago. This company was incorporated9 years ago. And Liz, it's yours.

What did Carl do to you, man? Eh? What did he do to you? - From what you're telling me this is a classic scam. This guy gets his residents to sign over powerof attorney to him. - That give him control-- - Over their finances andallows him to invest-- - However he wants. - You got it. So now he's making bigbucks with their money, and then he covers his tracks. - Dishing out phonystatements to them. - You got it. So now he's investedall of their funds into Woody's company. - But $3 million. Why would anyone? I mean,he just had a heart attack. - Well, if Woody dies,who's the executor? Who's the beneficiary? - Who inherits themoney? I got it. Son of a bitch. So you see, scumfacegets all the money. - You call the police. - You want to callthe cops? Go ahead. When they ask how we gotthis info, what'll you say? We broke into the office? We've been doing a littleillegal hacking? Huh? Gonna send Little Suzyto the slammer, huh? - She's right. Whatever we got on him, theywon't use it in court, right? It's inadmissible. - So we are supposed to catchthis jerk all by ourselves? - O, ye of little faith. He may be smart,but we're no dummies! We'll track him!We'll follow his every move. We'll catch him withhis pants down! - I don't know.I just don't know. Your plan is just--- Is brilliant! Rose is an actress, isn't she? Top form the other night! - I was terrific, you're right. - Rose, allyou got to do is go in there andgather intelligence. We provide the bait. - The bait? - Like about $100,000. - Dollars? Where can you get that? Oh... No way. - Joseph, re-mortgage the house. - Olive, you're nuts! - Joseph, you'll getthe money back! Minus the $100 mortgagefee, of course. - No, no. The answeris still no. No, no. - Fine. We'll comeup with something. We still need you,Rose, to get the info. At least some of ushave a conscience. - Rose... Last night... I couldn't sleep. - Probably gas. - No. It was... that kiss. - Where's the celery? - Here. Oh... - Now there you go. - Wow... Olive is going toend up in jail one day. I wouldn't be-- - Joseph Blahacek,please. Be quiet. - I'm sorry. - While the pieis in the oven... maybe we could... go upstairs. - What for? - To make love. If we wait much longer,I'll just lose my nerve. Now I've embarrassed myself. - No, Rose. It's... it's that-- - What? Say it. - I'm scared. - What do you think I am? - I've been thinking about thisever since I first saw you. - When I wackedyou with my cane? - Yes! - Joseph Blahacek,you are twisted. - Blahacek. Do youknow what it means? Blaho in Czech means bliss. And Blahacek, little bliss. - Not so little. - How much do youthink it's worth? - Must you give monetaryvalue to everything? - I mean, my house. What doyou think it's worth? - You're a good customer.Your house is worth a fair bit. I see no problem. - But I'm too old! - Go on! You're not that old. - My health is not so good. - Ah, touch of the flu myself. - I'm a bad credit risk. - Now who told you that? - I have measly pension, no job,no expectation of income. So, understand? - You remind me of my dad. Always got to lookat every angle. Which is good, but... Mr. Blahacek, I'mapproving the mortgage. It's a pleasure doingbusiness with you. - Oh... I had to fight herteeth and nails. But I got it! - I'm so proud of you! - Present diagnosis? - Brain tumour. Inoperable. - Oh, I see. How long does she... - Doesn't look good. - Uh-huh.

Was that a lie too? - No. No! It was real! And then I was ina state of shock. You've got tolisten to me. Look. A few years back I waskeeping the books for the home for Carl's father. But then there was a shortfall. He was on the vergeof losing everything. So I helped him out. I made a system. We sort of borrowpeople's money with every intentionof paying it back. But the old man died before we could do it. Do when Carl took over hewasn't paying nobody back. When he saw what we did, hestarted ripping people off. - Woody, why didn'tyou call the police? - Because he said if hewent down, so would I. I thought myhands were dirty. He made one mistake though. He didn't change thepassword on the computer. Frontier. The one I came upwith years ago. I was only trying to help. I was afraid hemight outsmart you. - You were afraidthe cops would get you! That's why you are onthat side of the fence and we are on thisside of the fence! - I was stuck. What else could I do? Come with me and the money. - Oh! Running off to Miami? Like fugitives? - Woody... The money doesn'tbelong to you. - I'm going to pay everyonewho is still alive back. The rest-- - Is stolen. - From dead people. - Shame on you. - Oh, Woody! Bravo! Bah! - Joseph! Wait! I just want to show everybody, especially you, Joseph,that I'm no wimp! Joseph! Joseph! Here's your money. Here, take it!It's your money. I'll come back ontwo conditions: We buy and runSunshine Manor properly with the rest of the cash. And from now on, I don't wantno more of this wimp stuff! You understand? Compris?
