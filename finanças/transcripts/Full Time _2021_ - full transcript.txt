FULL TIME Hi there... Hi there... Little puppy-dog... Many people took yesterday off... That's less likely today. 350 km of traffic jams before 8 AM. Breakfast's ready, kids. ...nothing like a usual day. The strikes are in protest at the increase in working hours to balance the welfare system... Come eat, you acrobat! - No! - Yes! - Mom? - Yes? Do you know the Jardin d'Acclimatation? ...trains replaced by buses... Have you ever been there? Yes. Can we go one day? Mom? We'll see. - Mom? - Yes? Can I invite Charles to my birthday party? You can invite who you want. - And Jules? - Yes. - And Gabriel too? - Ok. Be good with Mrs Lusigny, ok? - Good morning. - Hello. Come in. I know it's early. Thank you. I'm off. - Have they eaten? - Yes. Due to a passenger taken unwell, traffic to Paris is suspended. Please use replacement connections to your destination. Next stop: St Lazare. Hello? Ms. Roy, it's Ms. Morand from the bank. Hello. I'm calling about your mortgage again. Sorry, I've been very busy lately. We need an appointment soon to discuss repayment and your overdraft... I'll call you, we'll be cut off. I have to call outside bank hours to... No one can replace me tomorrow. You're not seeing a doctor. - I am. - No, you aren't, or you'd ask Sylvie. It's an interview. - For a job? - Yes. A good job? A really great job. When should I be here? 2 PM. Hi. I'll let you do the brief. - What is it? - I'm fed up. 7 in, 5 out, 8 stay-overs and the Churchill suite for Mr Yoshida. I should be free for the checks. Text me if you have to. There's a new girl. I can't train a new girl this week. You needed staff. It's too crazy right now. I have to see management. Can't it be next week? 212 has a leaky shower. The guest's moving to 206. 110 has a door problem. Carole, Sylvie will let you know. No furniture changes, no birthdays.... Any questions? I'll catch up. - Finished 203? - Yes. You'll do 205 before the Roosevelt. It's not processed food. She fooled us! - It's homemade tabbouleh? - Yes. Maybe it's best not to know! Hear they advise working from home to avoid the strikes? As if we clean toilets by computer! They have self-cleaning toilets in Japan. Toilets steal our jobs now! They clean the guest's ass too. - That's intrusive. - I tried it. There are two water jets, then it dries you. It's pretty amazing. Enjoy! This is Lydia. She starts today. Hello, Lydia. Julie is our head chambermaid. See you later. - Have you eaten? - Sit. - Juice? Coke? - No, thanks. - A glass of wine? - No. - She passed! - She nearly said yes. No, she drank before coming. - Where were you before? - The Rive Droite. - 3-star? 4-star? - 3-star. - You have no 5-star experience? - No. Hospitals can't go on! The guests are demanding. The price lets them be. Look inside every box. Some leave traps to check on you. You need a watch. No phones. I'll get one. And, careful, you smell. Find a good deodorant. The rule is, we're invisible. Ok? The cushions. Stay unnoticed, unless the guest asks. - Is TV allowed? - Never. But I need the transport news. Julie? Finish the Churchill. The guest's here. - Already? - Yes. Ok. I'll let you know. Vacuum the cushions and I'll get back-up. Can you help with the Churchill? - We're coming. - Great. Girls, Mr Yoshida's here. Can you do our room? Sorry. - Is it broken? - I don't think so. The guest's downstairs. Do the bathroom. Sylvie? A bouquet for 208, please. - Ok. And the suite? - Want to check? You do it. He's a platinum guest. I know. Thanks, girls. He's on his way up. We're done. How's the new girl? Ok, I guess. - In a hurry? - Sort of. They want your assessments. Shit! Thursday at the latest. Don't push them. That's not why they sent for you. But it was on the agenda. This is Alex. I can't talk now, but leave a message and I'll call you. It's me again. I haven't had the monthly alimony, I'm in deep shit. Could you see to it today, please? Call me. I need to talk to you. Bye. I have this. No, he'll break it in no time. Otherwise, we have this one. No, he'll wreck the house with that. Forget it. Do you have invitation cards? - At the checkout. - Thanks. Do you know where these buses go? No one's telling us. What have you eaten? You won't tell me? Nolan... Don't... Nolan, answer me, please. Don't upset Mrs Lusigny, ok? Are there replacement buses for line P? There's a train. - What platform? - 14. Good evening. What's wrong? Nolan was unbearable. Yes, he gets agitated in the evening. He should see a doctor. He may be hyperactive. No, he just takes after his mother. Can you find a solution for evenings? It's hard for me. I promise I will, if you can do a few more days. Don't be late on Friday. I'll be here. My daughter's fetching me. Here, salvaged from the hotel. These ones are pretty. I'm a knight! Nolan, stop that, please! - What now? - I want the bubble-bath. No, your bath's tomorrow. Nolan, pyjamas and bed! - And teeth! - Now! ...you're the leader in mass retailing... - Coming in? - I'm too busy. Come on... No, I'll have more time this weekend. I wanna see Dad. I told him you'd spend the holidays with him. We'll go to the beach? No, it'll be too cold for the beach. Elodie said we'd catch shellfish. You don't mind spending time with Elodie? No. - Is she nice to you? - Yes. - Nicer than me? - No. Right answer. Let's go now. I'm hungry. Here. Don't like that. - Don't like that. - There's a knot. Let me see. Nolan! Transport is as bad as yesterday. - I finish early. - That's no use without trains. I'll be on time. Wait! Can you give Nolan's invitations to his teacher? See you later. The train approaching platform 1 is a non-stop service. Please step back. Hello. I think your daughter is in my son's class. Yes, we've met. That's right. May I ask who's minding her? My father's helping this week. That's good. Would he like to mind two more? Minding his own granddaughter is already a lot. Of course. Yes, I understand. We're in for a long wait. Need leads? No, I know it's not the battery. Do you know mechanics? No, sorry. - Where are you going? - Paris. I can take you. You're going to Paris? To the march. Ok then. 30,000 demonstrators are expected... Been in the village long? Six years. And you? Born there. A good excuse to live in a hole. It was midway between my job and my ex's. And it's ideal for raising kids. When they're little, yes. Are you on strike? No, I'm a young retiree. A soldier? You're sharp. Just a matter of probability. In statistics? A little. I did market research for a while. - Not anymore? - No, not now. Going to march today? I wish, but I'm too busy dealing with the strikes, working in Paris. That's tough. Thank you. Goodbye. There are no trains. Sorry, the train was hell today. I know. Others were late. Lydia didn't know where to go. - Where is she? - With Claire. - That's good. - Take her, please. After this, other groups could express their anger: students, train drivers and even police officers. This afternoon, work with Amina. Ok. Don't tell anyone or it'll be tricky for me. We have a Bobby Sands. Fuck... Ok, we're on our way. Follow me. A guest soiled a room. Why "Bobby Sands"? He was an Irish prisoner who smeared shit on his cell walls. Spray deodorant in the corridor. - Who was here? - The Scottish singer. Ok, get the power washer. The power washer? All set? Due to high demand, all our drivers are busy. Please try later. Paul... Dressed up for me? Could you get me a hotel taxi? You know I can't. On the sly. Discreetly. It's important. Please. Come on... Fred? No improvement, with less public transport. In Paris, only the automated metro lines 1 and 14 are running. 1 in 4 TGVs, 1 in 10 intercity trains, 1 in 3 regional trains, 1 in 5 around Paris. Oil refineries may soon... Hello. I'm here to see Mr Dumont. If she doesn't answer, leave a message. Or call back later. I can't give you that information. Nicolas. Good luck. Ms. Roy? Yes. When was your appointment? Yes, alright. Sorry, it's not the same department. No, fix an appointment with her secretary. She'll be here tomorrow afternoon. Call her then. This is Alex. I can't talk now, but leave a message and I'll call you. Hi, did you get my last message? I need the alimony. It's urgent. We need to talk about the holidays. I need to get organized if you don't take the kids. Call me, please. There are no buses, ma'am. Excuse me, can I pay for a trampoline in installments? Yes, with our loyalty card. May I have the form? Could you deliver this weekend? For large articles, we need a week's notice. - Ok. Thank you. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Hello, it's Julie from this morning. Yes, hello. I was wondering if you're still in Paris. No, I'm almost home. Damn... Sorry. Never mind, but let me know if you go back to Paris. Of course. - Where to? - Gare de l'Est. Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please. Due to a strike, all scheduled trains from Paris are canceled. Please accept our apologies. Not one train? No, only replacement buses. - At the east exit? - Yes. You don't call often. I know... Mrs Lusigny is fed up of me being late with the strikes. Could you have the kids after school? I'd love to, but I'm in London until Thursday. How'll you get back with no trains? I'll fly. Of course. Do you know if Marco has heard from Alex? We last saw him when he brought the kids back. He stopped off to see you? I've been calling him all week. - No reply? - No. We're having friends over on Friday. Want to come? Will Alex be there? I'm asking you so I can see you. I'll see. Maybe. Hi, Irina. Sylvie's mad at you. Shit. You're with Ines today. Just what I needed! Are you ok? I had to do the Roosevelt alone. - Why didn't they send help? - No idea. Did you ask Sylvie? Only you were late. I live furthest away. Why not move closer? - Mind your own business. - It's your problem, not mine. - What's wrong? - I'm sick of the strikes too. I won't move my kids to a cubby hole for you. My place isn't a cubby hole. Mine would be. Your phone? Seriously? Hello? It's Marc Dumont. We met yesterday. Yes, hello, Mr Dumont. Could you meet our marketing manager tomorrow afternoon? Yes, of course. Is 3 PM ok? Perfect. At the same place? Yes, same floor, with Ms. Delacroix. She's seeing the final candidates. Alright. That's great. All the best. Thank you. Goodbye. Can you leave us? The manager asked about you. - He did? - He keeps nagging. I said I knew you were off. Thank you. He complained about the Roosevelt. Ines should have told you but she didn't. You count on me too much. You count on me a lot too. Less lately. And if I screw up, you're ok. You're getting sloppy. I'll do the assessments, but we never have time. Stop screwing up. Your file's growing. And being late doesn't help. They can't fire me for being late during a strike! If you knew what I hear, you wouldn't risk it. Did it go ok yesterday? Lydia's nice but no expert. I know. How did it go for you? They called me back for an interview. That sounds good. But it's tomorrow afternoon. Can you fill in again? No, sorry, Julie, I can't. - Please. - No. I work all weekend and have to help my sister move. I swear it's the last time. Don't insist. How did you get here? A carpool at my station. - You leave early? - Yes. You have kids? Yes, two. - It can't be easy. - It isn't. - My mom helps out. - That's good. I need to check something. - Claire. - Yes? Can you fill in tomorrow afternoon? I'm away for the weekend. - When do you go? - Tonight. Ines... You're off tomorrow? - Yes. - Can you fill in, in the afternoon, against a full day? No, but I admire your nerve. It's not nerve, it's important. It's still no. Paul... Hi. I need a taxi again tomorrow afternoon. Taxis are on strike. I know you have solutions. It's three times as much, in cash. Your cheapest one, then. You're a pain... I haven't cooked, I don't have beds, they don't have their things... - Couldn't you sleep at my place? - Certainly not. There are no trains or buses. I can't get back. I can't have children overnight! So I suggested my place. I can't, not in a house I don't know. I wouldn't be comfortable. I have no other solution, Mrs Lusigny. I don't think I can get back. I hate being cornered. I don't like this either. It's your responsibility. They're your children. I know, but I have no choice! Ok, I'll keep them here. Goodbye! Excuse me, are there replacement buses? No, nothing's moving. There's no minimum service? Not if the strike's announced. How come? Service isn't obligatory. So what do I do? I've nothing to suggest, sorry. Why are you here in that case? With luck, you'll find a ride nearby. No, I'm not playing the lottery! I live far away, my kids are waiting, shit! I'm fucking sick of it! Were you at the station too? Tough, isn't it? - Looking for a hotel room? - I'm fine, thanks. If you want a room, I have a comfy bed. With me in it. Get off my back. C'mon, chill. I'm being polite. Bitch! Good evening. Do you have a room free? I have one left. May I see it? It's on the 6th floor, I'm not going up. I can go up on my own. It's a normal room. Take it or leave it. Ok, I'll take it. Thank you. This is Alex. I can't... Employee Assessment Form Hello, Mrs Lusigny. I wanted a word before I start work. How did the night go with the children? I'd like to talk to them before school. You'll work with Carole this afternoon. Alright. I have a favor to ask. Validate my pass with yours. I'm not sure I... I endorse your trial period. I won't rat on you. Here. Just validate it when you leave. Hi, girls. We have a visitor. You'll work with Lydia this afternoon. - Why? - I'll be absent. You shouldn't do that. It's ok. I'll do the Jefferson and 207 during lunch. Sylvie will notice. Only if you tell her. Can you come with me a second? - Which pass have you got? - Both. Validate yours now and both when you leave. Don't forget. - Good luck. - Thanks. Hello. Hello. Mr Amrit? Paul gave me your number. Yes, you're Julie? Can you meet me in half an hour or so? It's the window model? Anything else in black? Just the other one I showed you. BANK Authorization pending Accepted Shock operations were organized earlier with demonstrations in many cities. Le Havre docks are blocked with piles of burning tires. 12 schools are closed. The Marseille docks are blocked too. Motorway toll booths... Hello. Is there a cloakroom? Only for staff. - Hello? - Julie, it's Sylvie. Hi... Come to see me tomorrow morning. Ok. As soon as you arrive. And try not to be late. Take a seat there. - There? - Yes. Tea or coffee? No, thank you. Ms. Delacroix won't be long. Hello. Hello. - Jeanne Delacroix. - Julie Roy. Thanks for coming despite the strikes. I set off early. - Come far? - From Paris. What's the address on your CV? My home. I was in Paris for the day. It's far away. Like coming from Paris without traffic. We do long days here. I imagine. So could you do long days for weeks, living so far away? Yes, it doesn't worry me. Your last job was over four years ago. Yes, when the company shut down, I took time to raise my children. That explains the gap in the CV. A pretty full gap. Returning to work doesn't worry you after so long? No. You'll see your children less. I love them, but I'm not made to be a stay-at-home mom. You're applying for a job below your previous functions. Yes, I moved ahead a bit too quickly earlier in my career. Won't you feel cramped as a market researcher? No, not at all. It matches my skills and interests. I'm very hands-on. I want to focus on long-term fulfillment. And why seek that in our group specifically? I want to work in the short supply chain. Plus you're the leader in mass retailing. Here, I could work on a greater scale. What was your former company's mission? We developed short supply food chains in isolated areas. Did you have more specific goals? My department did field studies. No competition with mass retailing? No. The company has shut down, but the website is still up. Yes, that's possible. I took a look at it. You seemed to want to attack mass retailers' local supply chains. We were treated harshly. That's competition, you know. Yes, but it went a bit too far. Your experience interests us. But if you want to work here, you have to be open with me, ok? Yes, of course. So we carry on openly? Yes. Hello. I'd like to rent your smallest van. A 10-cubic-meter one? That'll be fine. You're a petty boss talking like any other petty boss! The truth is we can't make ends meet! So we fight. It's 10 days since I saw my kids! What about me? Day and night for 10 days... Sorry, my battery died. I like them, but this is getting too much for me. I wish it could be different. Why not look for work nearby? There's no work for me around here. The supermarket hires. I can ask the manager. I've known him since he was a boy. Thanks, but I'm happier with my team in my hotel. Are your children happier? Let's talk tomorrow. My daughter's fetching me. You promised you'd be back. Yes, don't worry. Let's talk on Monday. I'll think over the weekend. - Nolan, your pajamas. - I want the fox. It's dirty, wear these tonight. No. Put these on! No, that's enough. Put them on. I want my fox! What are you doing? What did you eat? Ambouillettes. Andouillettes? The sausages? It was disgusting. There could be incidents in the projects where tension is high. Could the projects catch fire again? - Hi, Erwan. - You're early. Yes. Could you open the key box? I forgot my pass. Sure. Thanks. Hi. - Hi. - Are you ok? Fine. You left without a fill-in? For what. I'd done my rooms. Right... How did the interview go? It'll be fine. You're a killer! Julie? Yes? Come and see me, please. I'm on my way. Here. My assessments. Your pass. I had to fire Lydia. You wouldn't have kept her anyway. You know she raises two kids alone? - She's a child. - A child... I wanted to help. But you don't help me. I didn't force you to get rid of her. You left without warning again. It was urgent. I did all my work first. The girls told me why you left. - You don't give a damn. - Not true. You used a power washer! That bathroom needed it. You don't clean luxury tiling that way! There was shit everywhere! If you're sick of cleaning rich folks' shit, change jobs. We'll agree on a severance plan to let you find work in your field. Sylvie, I can't lose my job. Not now. It's already tough enough. I'm sorry for the trouble I caused, but I need my job. I don't know. Keeping you here won't help you. I've always looked for another job. No one replies to my CVs anyway. Yesterday's interview was the last. I swear, this is my only job. I'm afraid I'll lose mine if I keep you. Have you told management? Do they know? Why d'you ask? If you fire me, you'll be two girls short. I couldn't train a new head maid. You'll get the blame. The strikes will make it worse. If you keep me, we save each other. I swear I'll never be a problem again. Any trouble and it's over. I was supposed to hear today. I'm afraid I can't tell you anything. Do you know if she has decided? No. I was told I'd hear this morning. I wouldn't insist otherwise. I have no other information. Payment refused. - Can I pay by cheque? - No, not anymore. I'll leave some stuff. Mrs Lusigny, I'm on my way back. I won't be long. I'll keep you posted. See you shortly. Yes, Sophie! Hi. I've been calling you. I had no signal. Mrs Lusigny left me your kids. She had to leave. They're at your place? Great. I'm not far away. Could you come and get me? Good evening. This is Julie. Good evening. - I'll get Sophie. - Ok. - You were in Paris? - Yes. It can't have been easy. Hi. Hi. I'm sorry. Mrs Lusigny didn't call. I forgot you were the emergency contact. She couldn't reach you, but it's ok. - A drink? - No, I'll take the kids and go. No, a drink first. Where are they? Asleep upstairs. - Did it go ok? - They went out like lights. I'd make a good mother. Don't delude yourself, they had a shitty week. You too, by the look of it. Yeah. Sorry, I have to go. Hey, it's Friday. You're my only friend and I never see you. It's Nolan's party tomorrow. I have stuff to do. Have a drink and I'll help tomorrow. Now I recognize you. Thank God I drink less now. You're so funny drunk. I know one who wouldn't agree. - Did you get to speak to him? - No. I left him messages all week. I'm fucking sick of chasing after him. Want to meet a friendly guy I know? No, I'll go home. I have a lot to do. You never stop. Don't worry. I'll fetch them. I saw the fucking handle somewhere! Hello. I've brought my son. You're Leo's dad? Need a hand? - You have time? - No plans. Could you set the table? There's no safety net? Yes, it's underneath. Is it broken? No, I couldn't attach it. We'll get it set up, then. Green light, red light! Green light, red light! This clip goes here. Yes, that's it. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you, Nolan I like the red color and the letter "N". Leo! He must be hiding with my son. I'll find him. There's no hurry. A hot bath and bed? Yes. If I have hot water. Why? My boiler keeps going on the blink. - Shall I take a look? - No, it's ok. Sure? Do you know boilers? If it's electric. Alright then. There you go. Just a faulty contact. But hard to spot. Well done. The boiler's badly positioned. Thank you. You've saved me twice now. Army training. Not only that, I hope. I like to help. Sorry. Forgive me. I think I'll go now. Yes, I think it's for the best. - Really, I'm... - It's ok. This is Alex. I can't talk now, but leave a message and I'll call you. Hi, Alex. I don't know what's going on but I'm sick of talking to a machine. It's your son's birthday. You may not want to talk to me, but don't make him pay. I'm really tired and I need you to take them for the holidays. You decide, but we need to talk. So call me, please! Mom... Nolan... Go back to bed, please. I'm scared. Scared of what? I had a nightmare. Go to bed, sweetheart. I'm coming. Can you stay with me, please? Yes, alright. Mom... What time is it? 1 PM. I don't believe it... Have you eaten? We finished the cereals. Why didn't you wake me? We did, but you wanted to sleep. Really? Sweetheart... Kitten... Stop playing now and let's eat. - One's jumping! - Now, I said. Stop now and put the game away. Hi, it's me. I didn't forget it's Nolan's birthday. Maybe you're too mad at me to answer, but I'm calling anyway. Sorry about the alimony. I'll see to it. I didn't call because I'm not in France. There's no coverage here. I'll call when I get back next week. Kiss the kids for me, please. - Coming? - Not now. Come on. - No, later. - Please! This is Alex. I can't talk now, but leave a message and I'll call you. Mom! Nolan! Where does it hurt? Your arm? - Did he hit his head? - No. Hold on. Run and get a blanket! It'll be ok, sweetheart. The morning paper headlines all sum up the situation. "The inferno", "Paris in shock", "A surge in violence", "Demonstrators and rioters clash"... Police tear gas was countered with projectiles. Cars burned, stores ransacked, buildings on fire... 287 arrests in Paris yesterday, 110 people injured. It all began around 9 AM, with violence increasing during the day. Christophe was among the demonstrators... Mom! Coming! What happened to you? I fell off the trampoline. It was his birthday present. Sorry about Friday. You did right. I had a long talk with my daughter. I can't keep having them. But this week will be easier. I heard different. It's too hard for me. My family's worried. It's not fair on me or the children. How will it help them, not having a nanny? I'll have them till the end of the week? What can I say? I have no other solution. My daughter said she'd call welfare if I didn't stop. Why? She thinks it's too hard on me and the children. She mustn't call welfare. Is she crazy? No, she won't do it. So why tell me that? She wants me to stop having them. It's not you. I was wrong to mention it. She won't, I promise. Go now, you'll be late. Where are you going? Bastille. - How much? - Up to you. You'd go faster on foot. I'll be really late on foot. I think staying could be worse. Paul! Can you lend me your pass? No, I can't. No one will see. I had orders not to let you in. You're joking? No. - For God's sake... - Stop, Julie! Let me by. Julie, don't make me! Could I speak to someone in the department, anyone? Just a second. Thank you. Yes, hello? Hello, my name's Julie Roy. I had an interview with Ms. Delacroix last Thursday for the market research manager job. Yes. I was expecting a reply Friday. No one called you? No. In that case, the job is filled. Are you sure? We only call with positive replies. But Ms. Delacroix promised to call whatever the decision. Ms. Delacroix is on a business trip. She'd have called. She was away the day she said she'd call. I don't know what else to say. She'd have called you. Alright. Thank you. You're welcome. Goodbye. Goodbye. Market research manager Master in Economics Hello. You're back early. I'm taking a few days off. Good idea. So I'll fetch the kids from school. They'll be pleased. And I've found someone to mind them. Your daughter will be happy. I said I'd take them this week. Have a lie-in. Can you bring them one afternoon? I promised they'd pick their pumpkin. Of course. Hello. I'm Julie Roy. I live in the village and this is my CV if you need staff. Any checkout experience? No, but I'm comfortable with people and very methodical. Maybe in the Christmas period... I can work on the aisles too. Ok, thanks. Mrs Lusigny told me to come and see you. She likes to send me people. Ok, thank you. Thank you. Mom? Yes? Mom? Yes? No cookies left. - Why aren't you at work? - I've taken a few days off. Mom! I know, I have to do the shopping. I want my snack. Why take time off? I'm a bit tired. Don't empty the cupboard! What's wrong? Play outside while I find something. Can we go shopping? No, not today. - Why not? - I don't want to. I'm hungry too. Play outside, damn it! Scram! And no trampoline! This is Alex. I can't talk now, but leave a message... I won't work tomorrow. You can sleep. Can we stay with you? - No school? - No. Me too. It's not good to miss school. Can we go to the Jardin d'Acclimatation? Not tomorrow. - What's that? - A theme park! - Please. - It's a long way from here. Please, Mom. Please... Please. Is a car coming? There should be one soon. Can I play on your phone? The train approaching platform 1 is a non-stop service. Please step back. Thank you. Give this to the man on the ride. Hello? Hello. Ms. Roy? Speaking. It's Jeanne Delacroix. We met last week. Yes, that's right. I wanted to call but I was busy and got held up. Yes, they told me. I'm happy to tell you that you're our choice. We liked your profile and the job's yours. Really? I can give you a day or two to think it over, but no more. No, it's good for me. That's fine. I'm delighted then. Welcome to the team. Thank you very much. I need to see you soon. Are you free for lunch on Thursday? Yes, that's perfect. Thursday, 1 PM, at the office? Yes, alright. See you Thursday. See you then. Goodbye. Have a good day. Mommy!
