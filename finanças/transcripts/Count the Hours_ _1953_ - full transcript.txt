George. George. George, George! George. George! George. George! George. Yeah? Good morning, Mr Taylor. Mr Morgan. Morgan. Morgan, who did it? Who shot you? Morgan. Save your breath, Gill. We were too late. He'd been lying out there all night. Why didn't you report this sooner? - Didn't know of it until this morning. You live here on the place, don't you? - Round the back. But surely you heard the shots? - No. No I didn't. My wife did though. - You mean to tell me .. That a woman was shot and killed on your own doorstep and you heard nothing? No. You didn't hear shots or a cry or anything? He's trying to tell you that I heard shots. I thought someone was hunting possums. How long have you worked here? My uncle hired them on the first of the month. Where before that? Here. And there. - Doing what? Fruit picking. Harvesting. Anything I could get. - A fruit tramp? What's wrong with that? Did you know Morgan kept a considerable amount of money in the house? I'll say he did. I told uncle Fred he should be more careful. Gill. Well, here it is. That's what killed her. A 0.32 calibre. Same as the ones in Morgan. Got a gun? I said, have you got a gun? No, no. No, I haven't. What were you going to say? Come inside please. Why did you say you didn't have a gun? - We're strangers here, honey. It's no use sticking our necks out. - Come here, friend. Taylor says he saw you shoot a weasel down by the lake the other day. Well? It wasn't my gun. You know what will happen to you if we find you do have one? Don't you? Search that cottage for a 0.32. No gun here. Sorry about the mess. You'd have saved a lot of time if you'd come clean in the first place. If your gun didn't fire those shots you're in the clear. Well, it didn't. I don't understand it. That's where I've always kept it. Ellen. Ellen. Just saw the girl throw a gun in the lake. You saw what? Why did you let her do that? I didn't know what she was up to. We searched the house for a gun. I didn't know she had it. Ellen. I threw the gun in the lake. They'll never find it now. You what? - I threw the gun in the lake. Oh, Ellen. George. George, what's the matter? I found these in the tool shed. 0.32 calibre alright. Well, that is enough for me. Take them both down to headquarters. Anything doing? - Yeah. I just froze solid. He must be a pretty tough cookie with Gillespie on him for 16 hours. Ellen. George, I can't stand it. Darling, what have they done to you? - They won't believe me. I told them, I've told them but they won't believe me. They think we are lying. They ask and they ask. I am so sick. What will we do? All we can do is tell the truth. We didn't know about those two people being killed. Maybe they'll believe us if we keep on telling them. I can't. I just can't anymore. You've got to get her out of here. Let her go. So you're ready to sign this confession? - I can't sign it. I didn't kill anyone. Braden. Surely you don't expect us to believe this nonsense. You can hear just as well as anyone else. Yet you didn't hear those shots. I was asleep. - You can see as well as anyone else. Yet you can't see a woman lying five feet from you. She was behind the hedge. Then you tell us you haven't got a gun. I was afraid. All of a sudden you remember. You do have a gun. And it just happens to be a 0.32. You say you'll show it to us to prove it didn't fire those shots. Big surprise. It disappeared. Well, it disappeared because you told her to throw it in the lake. No he didn't. He didn't. She was only trying to help me. Of course she was. Because she knew it was the murder weapon. We'll get her to admit that. Lock him up. I'm sorry. Now, Mrs Braden. Why don't you tell us the truth? I've told you the truth. George was sleeping there beside me. I woke him up and I heard these shots. How could he have fired them? So he knew the shots were fired and yet did nothing about it? Come on, Mrs Braden. What was there to do? He went outside and looked around. He said that people around there hunted possum at night and that's what I heard. That is what happened. What do you want me to tell you? Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Stop it. Let her go. I'll sign your confession. I'll sign anything! Guard! Guard, let me out of here. I'll sign your confession. Hey, what's up? - Braden. He just confessed. I'm sorry. I cannot do it. Why, Doug? You have taken cases for the county before. Not like this. I'm not a criminal lawyer. Why not Baxter? He's the public defender. He's in the hospital and all the others are tied up. If I've to wait on the public defender's office it will tie me up for weeks. No. I do not like it. I know you have a lot of clients to think about. But since all you can do is enter a plea of guilty. It should not take up too much of your valuable time. I am not thinking about the time. If there were any doubt as to Braden's guilt, of course I would defend him. Doug, it's just routine. I hate to put this as a favor. But .. But you've done a lot of them for me, Mr District Attorney? Okay. Since you didn't put it as a favor. I'll get on over to the jail. Sit down. I am Doug Madison. The county has asked me to take your case. No matter what you've done you have certain rights before the law. If I take your case it will only be to see that those rights are protected. I have just left the District Attorney's office. You enter a plea of guilty and I think I'll get you off with life. But I am NOT guilty. You confessed. Who wouldn't after sixteen hours? I had Ellen up there too. I'd have done anything to get them off her neck. You're going to stick to that story? It is true. I didn't kill anybody. But I had to get Ellie out of there. She is going to have a baby. Look here, Braden. It is one thing to plead guilty. But if you're going to try and pretend you're innocent, I am not your man. Mr Madison. Would you go and see Ellen and .. Tell her I'll be .. Tell her I'll be okay. And tell they can't do nothing to a man that never did nothing wrong. I'll see her, Braden. Bell .. do me a favor, will you? Call Gillespie and tell him that I'm not going to take the case. Sure Mr Madison. Mrs Braden. I am Doug Madison. An attorney. I've just come from your husband. You're going to help him? - I don't believe I can. From what he tells me about you this kind of athletics can't help you any. He asked me to see you and to tell you that .. He'll be alright. Please, Mrs Braden. Don't. It won't help any. I'm to blame. I'm to blame. I threw away his one chance to clear himself. I threw the gun in the lake. Is that what you have been doing in the lake? Look for that gun? Do you want to find it? I've got to find it. The police couldn't. They finally gave up. I've got to prove it didn't fire those shots. You're that sure it didn't? But your husband confessed. They had him up there for sixteen hours. They had me up there for sixteen hours. They let him know it too. What did you expect him to do? Mrs Braden, if I thought for one minute that your husband was innocent .. Whether you believe me or not. Whether you help me or not I'm going to prove he didn't do it. I am going to find that gun in spite of you or the police or anybody. This morning you weren't going to take the case. Why this interest in Braden's confession? It might change my mind. You were right in the first place, Doug. It doesn't do a young attorney any good to take a case he's bound to lose. Maybe he is clean? You can read, can't you? Maybe he made it so you would leave his wife alone. Maybe he wanted to get his picture in the papers. No Doug. It's the off season of that resort. All these harvest tramps and fruit bums are on their uppers. Every year at this time we have some sort of trouble. Braden had a good job. - That's what he said. How do you know old Morgan hadn't given his walking papers? Find any of the stolen money on him? No. He stashed that away somewhere. No. You don't believe he is innocent. I believe his wife believes he is. - What gave you that idea? She is diving for that gun. - What? She wants to prove it didn't fire those shots. You mean she knows it did and wants to hide it in a safer place. Now that gun is state's evidence. If she tries to dispose of it again .. Don't fog your glasses. It's safe where it is. Remember? You stopped looking for it. Well, we can get a conviction without it. You going to take the case? I don't know. I don't know. That will be $4.73. Four? You must have forgotten the carton of cigarettes. Ah, they are a present. There is something kind of comforting about a cigarette. I guess you could stand a little comfort round about now. That is very kind of you. They're not for me though. They're for George. That will be a dollar .79. Yes. Of course. Those hoodlums. My glass. They'll go to jail for this. What is it, Mr Jaynes? It's for you. They want me to go away. Or they will .. I am sorry. I forgot. Forget it, Mrs Braden. Like I said. The cigarettes are a present. Thank you. I heard you went up to see Braden. - That's right. Are you going to take the case? Why? Because he's a dirty lowdown murderer. That's why. Wait a minute. In this country a man is innocent until he is proven guilty. Sure. Just to waste the taxpayers money. Fred Morgan and Susan Watson were friends of ours. They were friends of mine too. Good friends, I bet. If you defend their killer. You don't know Braden is a killer. Even if he is, he deserves a fair trial. So you're going to take the case, huh? I've had some doubts about it but you have sure helped me make up my mind. Hi, Doug. Anything new? Yeah. I just learned how to save the taxpayers money. If a man looks guilty. Hang him. If he wants a trial. Hang it. This is exhibit A, counsellor. On the night of September 4th you did wilfully hold one Paula Mitchener .. In your arms and alleged some very pretty things. Therefore it is the decision of this court .. That you be sentenced to the bonds of holy matrimony. Hi. How about it? Idiot. You know well I always wanted to marry you. If only you weren't so filthy rich. Don't look down your nose at money. Lots of people I know value it highly. I am not knocking it. I like it. I just want something of my own to offer you. Will you consider a thriving law business .. And a personable young man who is devoted to you? It is .. possible. But coax me. Excuse me. I am sorry. - You're sorry? You don't know now hard this guy is to get. I didn't mean to .. - This is my fianc?e Paula Mitchener. Helen Braden. - How do you do? Braden? Not the .. No, Doug, You can't get mixed up in a thing like that. It will ruin you. I should not have come. - Of course you should have. What is it, Mrs Braden? This note. It was wrapped around a rock they threw the grocery store window. If you know what is good for you will .. Here. Sit down. I am frightened. There will always be crackpots who will do things like this, Mrs Braden. They don't follow them up. But the hate. It's terrible to be hated. To sit alone and feel it outside. Thick and heavy and all around George. George never hurt anybody. They hate him so. They'll make it look like he did. And then they'll hang him. And we can't do anything about it. There isn't anything we can do about it. Yes there is. We can find that gun. I've tried, Mr Madison. I have tried and tried. We'll have someone else try. Now listen to me. If you husband killed those people that gun will prove it. There won't be any second chance. He will go straight to the gallows. Are you willing to bank his life on what we'll find? Yes. Of course I am. I am taking this case, Paula. I'm sorry. I know how you feel about it. - Correction Doug. How I felt. You see, I'm aboard too. I believe her. There you are. Sorry about that 2-cent mistake. What's a couple of pennies to a fellow like you? I hear you're getting fifty bucks a day diving for that gun over at the lake. I rate it. A skindiver, ain't you? I bet that is kinda interesting. This job is. - Yeah? I don't mean looking for the gun. This job is very interesting. Maybe he will find it tomorrow. But the mud is so deep. You are not leaving? - Mr Madison can't keep it up. He's paid me for the last three weeks but he has to let me go. We have got to find that gun. I know you are in a spot and it's tough. But I got to live too. Well, look. You are a fine diver. I'm the best. Then do me a favor and don't go. Please stay. It means so much to me. You ain't suggesting I work for free are you? No. I guess not. It is just that I would do anything to get that gun. Maybe .. Wait a minute. This is my grandmother's brooch. You want me to keep working for you, don't you? Yes but .. No. No. Please don't come any closer. Please don't. [ Scream! ] I wish I had a picture of this. No wonder you are footing the bills. Are you alright, Mr Madison? Yes. If my jaw is still hooked on. That will teach me to stick to the law. How do you feel? I'm alright. I just .. There is no hope. Tell me the truth. There isn't any hope, is there? Not much, Ellen. I'm not even sure I can get him off with life. You've spent so much money. I wish I had more. But the kind of clients I did have. Don't seem to want the kind of a lawyer I am now. Miss Mitchener was right. It has ruined you. I've had to let the private detectives go too. They haven't turned up a shred of anything. If George didn't commit those murders somebody did. The gun was our only hope. And now it will never be found. Maybe it will. I can raise another hundred. We'll offer it as a reward. There are dozens of high school kids who will dive day and night for that. Hello there. Off kinda early tonight, ain't you? I quit. That lawyer ran out of dough. I guess it was bound to happen sooner or later. That lady don't care who pays the bills. - Mrs Braden? Well, she always seemed such a nice .. Say, you don't think ..? - That's right, Mack. I don't think. I know. Give me five gallons. - Sure. I will be right with you. Randy's Super Service. Hello Marge. Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll be home. Say, Marge. I just heard the funniest thing. I don't know if it's true or not but the fellow sure seemed to know. Yeah. He said that Mrs Braden over at the lake. Well, it seems the lawyer has run out of money and .. She doesn't care who pays the bills. No. I wouldn't say looked surprised. More like he was pretending to. Objection. The witness's suppositions are not admissible evidence. Objection sustained. Strike that out. Put in layman's language, the primary cause of death was the bullet wounds. To the best of my knowledge the shots were fired at about 12 o'clock midnight. Yes, sir. I recognise it. It's a box of 0.32 calibre bullets that I found in George Braden's tool shed. Thank you. I sure did see her. I wasn't 50 feet away when she threw the gun in the lake. Yes, Mr District Attorney. This is the confession George Braden made and signed in my presence. Then you had no reason to believe that George Braden knew he was dead? No. But he must have. Seeing as how he'd already shot him. Mr Madison. Mr Madison. We've found it! Mr Madison. Mr Madison. We've found it. The gun. Come back here. Come back. This is the gun that proves George Braden's innocence, Your Honor. I ask for an adjournment. Until ballistics can determine it is not the murder weapon. I object. The defense attorney may not inform the technicians what they are to find. Then you take the gun. You superintend the test. Your Honor. I withdraw the objection. The court is recessed. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to offer before this court .. Shall be the truth .. The whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you? I do. Will you please tell the court your name and occupation. Howard Combes. I am a technician at the ballistics laboratory. You are considered an expert, are you not? I am. Is this the gun that sworn testimony has determined .. Was found at Olin lake this morning? It is. You have given the gun the necessary tests to determine its borings? I have. And compared them with the bullets that killed Fred Morgan and his housekeeper? I was unable to. Why were you unable to? The barrel is rusted. The characteristic markings have been completely obliterated. There is no way of telling. Whether or not it fired the fatal shots. George Braden, stand up and face the jury. Have you reached a decision? We have, Your Honor. And how do you find the defendant? Your Honor, we find the defendant guilty. No. No, you can't! He is innocent. I know it. I thought I saw a light. Hi, doctor. Thanks for your testimony. You tried to help. I only told the truth. Here's a prescription. It may quiet your nerves. What is it? - Acetylsalicylic acid. What's that? Aspirin. It's not that kind of a headache. What's going to happen to Ellen? I'm going to get her a job as housekeeper. Who would have her? - Me. My Mrs Matthews leaves next month. Going to live with her daughter. She just decided she was tired of working. Thanks, doc. I think you got a client. I could sure use one. Are you Madison? That's right. Come in. The name is Beatty. Jeff Beatty. I operate a little saloon here in town. So? I need a lawyer. One that .. Won't ask too many questions. Do you think maybe we can do business? What do you sell in the saloon? Mickeys? No, no. No. The bar business is strictly on the up and up. Confidentially we do operate a little .. A little private enterprise in the back room. Lately, the cops have been getting kinda nosy. Why are you telling me all this? Well, you are Braden's mouthpiece, ain't you? Sure. Sure. I get it. You want me to put the fix in so you can operate a wheel at the back, huh? You are smart. And I get a cut of the profits I suppose? Yes, sir. A slice every week. Monday morning on the dot. Well, counsellor. How do you feel about it? Well, sir. Like this. You did all you could, Doug. They still sentenced Braden to hang. Why don't you just relax this afternoon? We'll play some tennis and maybe have dinner together. I would like to Paula, but I have to get over to Ellen Braden's. To tell her we're going to appeal. Appeal? Of course. Braden didn't commit those murders. I have to appeal. Yes. I suppose so. You sound as if you didn't expect me to do it. It isn't just that. Of course, I want you to do everything possible to save the man's life. But you've already done it. I don't believe it will do any good to appeal. Maybe not. But I've got to appeal. - Why? A lost case is one thing, Doug. But you're making this a crusade. Paula. When I became a lawyer I took an oath to uphold my fellow man's rights. It's hardly realistic. You've already thrown away a practice that's taken years to build up. You haven't a client left. And what about us? We haven't had any time together for months. This case could go on for years. I can't drop it as long as I believe he's innocent. I wouldn't want you to if I felt there was a chance to get George Braden off. But there isn't. Doug, you are just fighting windmills. I'd rather do that Paula, than fight with you. But I'm stuck with the fact that the man is innocent. I suppose you've heard what people are saying? About you and Ellen? It is very cruel. You are alright, Paula. Not many women would understand like you do. There aren't many women who've had so much practice. Mrs Braden, I .. - Mr Madison. I am glad you've come. - Yeah. So am I. I want this woman off of my property. - Your property? Inherited from my uncle's will. I'll not have his killer's wife squatting on it. She has been paying rent to the estate. You mean you have. Anyhow, I want her off. I've got plans for this place. I bet you have, You had them even before your uncle's death, I imagine. Yes. Maybe I did. I didn't have nothing to do with his dying. You just hoped he would. Is that it? - That's a dirty lie. No-one liked Fred Morgan more than me. When Max Verne threatened to kill him I was the one who .. Who? - Max Verne. The hired man before George. - He threatened to kill your uncle? He sure did. But he was a loony. When he was hollering and screaming .. Why didn't you tell this to the Sheriff? What for? What's it got to do with anything? Maybe a lot. Where is this man? - How should I know? He was up at the Sager place before he came here. And don't try any of your lawyer tricks to confuse me. I liked my uncle. And I want his murderer's wife off my place. She stays until her rent is up. Well. She'd better be off by the first. Maybe I'd better go now, Mr Madison. He might make trouble. - Forget it. I came to tell you we'll appeal but there's a chance now we won't have to. You mean because of this Max fern? - Why not? Someone killed those two and a guy who threatens Morgan is worth investigating. I will let you know. Keep your chin up. Hi. Does Max Verne live here? Why? Because I would like to talk to him. He ain't here. But he does live here? Yeah. When he is around. You are his daughter? My old man lives down the road. I got sick of raising nine brothers and sisters. Oh. Your husband? What's the matter? Surprised? Frankly, yes. It is .. It's hard to figure that a girl with your good looks and .. Attributes would be interested in .. I ain't interested. He bought me a pair of shoes. With high heels? Want to see them? Sure. What do they look like? What color? Say. It isn't every girl that can wear those. Had them long? Max never had any money until a couple of months ago. That is when I moved down here. Didn't he get you a dress to go with it? I'd sure like to see you in that outfit. I wear it down at Blinkey's every Saturday night. Thanks for the word. Get him to buy you a green dress too. It would go good with your eyes. Yes? Yeah. Why don't you start working on him as soon as he gets home tonight? He ain't coming tonight. He said he wouldn't be back until Monday or Tuesday. That long, huh? He's working. Where? I don't know. Shouldn't you keep better track of him? Why? He is nothing to me, the stir-crazy bum. Stir-crazy? Here. Here it is. I knew you had a record on him as soon as I heard he'd been in prison. If it's in connection with the Braden case .. Shouldn't it be handled by the sheriff of your county? The Sager farm was in yours. All I'm asking is that you pick up Max Verne for questioning. Now look at the facts. His time was served for breaking and entering. He's only had money since the robbery and murders. And he did threaten Morgan's life. That is good enough for me. We'll pick him up as soon as he gets back. Give me a shot. 35 cents. 35 cents. 35 cents. He hasn't shown up yet, huh? He will. This is Wednesday. He may never come back. He has got a reason to. - Yeah. I have seen her. I'll give him a couple more days. Max. Stop or I'll shoot! [ Gunshot! ] Stop Verne! He's making for the highway. - Head him off. He hopped a truck. Call for the car and stop that truck. - Right, Chief. Alright, Verne. Come on out and you won't get hurt. Come on out. Put those hands in the air. Get 'em up. I ain't got no guns. - Put your hands up. Come on. I didn't kill him. I didn't kill nobody. You threatened to, didn't you? You threatened to kill Fred Morgan. I didn't. I never did. There's an Alvin Taylor who says you did. Well, he's a liar. I might have said .. I was sore. I don't know what I said. You were sore because he fired you, weren't you? He'd caught you stealing. - No. That ain't why. Why not come clean, Verne? We know all about it. You brooded over Morgan firing you for a few weeks. And decided to get revenge. You sneaked up to the house intending to kill him. I didn't! I never would have if he hadn't .. Hadn't what? Come in and caught you at the desk? No. I am sick. I don't know what I'm saying. Yes you do, Verne. You said you wouldn't have killed Morgan if he hadn't caught you at the desk. That all you went there for was the money. Well, it was mine, wasn't it? He owed it to me. I work by the month. When he kicked me out he only gave me a week's pay. Now he done the wrong. He gave me the right to all of it. So you got mad and shot him. - I wasn't mad. I was scared. He came in and he had a gun and he was going to kill me. Then that old woman came running out. I had to stop her, didn't it? Well, didn't I? She was going to tell on me. Can I have a drink? - Sure. I hope you like water. You got it? - Every pretty word. I'll be back. I must tell Braden's wife. Where is the money, Verne? I'll never tell. It's mine! And you will never find it on account of I'll never tell. Hiya, Mr District Attorney. I am busy. If you'll please .. - Never mind the brush off. This is a switch. I'm not getting news. I am giving it. Yes? Braden is innocent. That's ridiculous. It's going to make you look like quite a sap, isn't it? Braden is guilty. Madison still doesn't think so. In fact, he's got a confession. From whom? - From the guy who says he did it. Broke in to rob the house. Morgan caught him. Then this character shot him and Miss Watson. Who did? Some crumb that used to work for Morgan. Says he .. Max Verne? Yeah. And Madison has a confession from him? He sure has. They're holding him over in Fairview County. It's going to make quite a story for my paper. You think so? Then you run along and write it, son. That I will. Give me Sheriff Bell. Sheriff. I've got a little jolt for you. Madison has a confession from Max Verne. "He can't do this." Simmer down. All I want you to do is to go to Judge Hale and get a writ of habeas corpus. And order us a car to get to Fairview County. It seems in order. Where is he? We have him here. Verne. Did you make this confession? Yeah. I guess so. My arm hurts. Sheriff. The murder occurred in my county. This is my prisoner. I will take charge. - No you don't. There's a little matter of Habeas Corpus before you go jouncing off with him. Okay, Doug? Open up. - Alright, Verne. Come along. See you in court, Counsel. Braden. You awake? Yeah. A man down at Fairview. Just confessed to the Morgan/Watson murders. Confessed? - Shush. It's on the wires now. It will be in the papers in the morning. Who was it? The name is Verne. Know him? No. No. He used to work for Morgan. He made a full confession. If it's on the level .. You'll be getting out of here. You will be going home. Home. Sure. Pretty soon too. There will be a court hearing but they will rush it. I shouldn't be doing this. Goodnight. Ellie. You made this confession? Did you make this confession? Yep. I made it. You admit that you killed Mr Morgan and Miss Watson on the night of October 15. No. I don't. You made this confession. You signed it. But I did not kill those people. I wasn't even there. Your Honor. The defense is prepared to prove that this confession was made in good faith. Just a minute. Mr Verne. Do I understand that you did make this confession? Yeah. I guess so. But it ain't true. If it isn't true, why did you make it? They made me do it. I did not want to but they beat me up. That's a lie. It ain't a lie. You beat me up. You and that there sheriff. This is ridiculous, Your Honor. There were deputies present. They'll testify that .. If the court pleases. This could be cleared up very quickly. If the people may present a witness. - This is out of order, Your Honor. If it will save time .. Call your witness. Doctor Ronald Seabright. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to offer in this court .. Shall be the truth, the whole truth and, nothing but the truth so help you? I do. - State your name. Doctor Ronald Seabright. - Be seated please. You are Doctor Ronald Seabright? - I am. And you are acquainted with the man who just left the stand? Yes. Well acquainted. In what circumstances, doctor? For two years Max Verne was a patient under my care .. At the state hospital for the insane. Would you consider him dangerous? Dangerous? Why, no. You are aware that Max Verne has made a full confession to an inhuman crime? Max Verne would confess to anything. If it were properly suggested to him. Thank you, Dr Seabright. Your Honor. I believe that counsel has fallen into a trap. In every widely-publicised murder case .. Some poor psychopath wanders into a police station and confesses. It's a familiar pattern. His being insane doesn't prove he didn't do it. True. Yet, since the witness has been shown to be incompetent. His confession therefore is invalid. Have you any material evidence to substantiate his statements? No. We have no reason to doubt the validity of his confession. He admitted taking the money. - Can you produce it? And prove that it was in his possession? We haven't located it yet. What about the gun with which he allegedly fired the shots? We'll find it. If the court will grant a motion for a new trial. A court of review has no authority to grant such a motion. Except on the most convincing evidence. In this case .. The court has no reason to deny it. You Honor. Case is dismissed. Court is adjourned. Well, you are free now. You can go. What did you do? Bust out? No. They let me go. You're telling me they say you didn't do it? Yes. That's right. They said I was nuts. I could have told them that. You got no call to talk to me like that. You like me. - Ha. Well, you do like me. You like me alright. Let go. Say you like me. Maybe. You was waiting out here for me because you was worried. Yeah. I was worried. That maybe you had some money on you. I come to get it before they lock it up. Don't you never think of nothing except money? Sure I do. I thinks a lot about truth. It ain't true you came here just for the money. Let me go, you pig. Let me go. Let me go. I said. Wait a minute, Verne. There is no use getting sore. On account of her. - You take your hands off her. You leave her alone. Now take it easy, Verne. Take it easy. Come on home. I'll cook some beans. How is Mrs Brady? The Doc is taking her to the hospital. Don't take it so hard, Doug. You did everything you could. You know, I wish I had you with me. We could use a man of your integrity and tenacity. I know Braden is innocent. - That's what I mean. And I still think Verne did it. Then find the money. I am all for you. Or the murder weapon. - That was found in the lake. Why didn't you come to me about this Verne business? I could have told you. - You could have told me at Fairview. It was ready to hit the papers then. It would look as if I'd put the lid on it. It had to be cleared up publicly. I suppose so. - I see how you were fooled alright. You know, Verne was a prime suspect with us for a week or so. The day of the murder the bartender from Sullivan's came in. He told us about Verne screaming around the saloon before it was time to open. He needed a drink because he'd been so badly shaken by the murders. Yeah? Then we found out that he'd worked for Morgan and had been fired. It looked good to us too. Follow it up? Like bloodhounds. Until we discovered Verne comes unglued whenever anything exciting happens. Even a parade gives him the screaming minnies. One saloon had to give him a bottle to get him out of the place. But he had money after the killings. - Yes. We checked that too. He had been working out at 3 Mile. Wilton had paid him off that day. Then when we looked up Dr Seabright. Well. Don't take it too hard, Doug. You said that. Doug. Doug. It's a fine little boy. Only four pounds but he's going to be alright. So is Ellen. You know, she certainly appreciated you being here. That's a small enough thing to do. Should I see her? - I've just given her a sedative. I'll make it tomorrow then. I want to get over to Paula's. - At this hour? It's about nine, isn't it? Doug. You have been asleep. I'm sorry about the dinner party, Paula. - Think nothing of it. They ought to be used to you not showing up. How did things go at the hospital? - It's a boy. The Doc says he'll be okay even if he did come so early. And Ellen? - She'll be alright. Shouldn't you have stayed? She might need her hand held. That was a low blow, wasn't it. I guess my femininity is showing. Paula, you are not .. - Jealous? No. Not in the conventional sense. I guess the world is full of unfortunate, unhappy people and .. There will always be an Ellen Braden. I want a husband I come first with. Stinking of me, isn't it? So this is it? Yes. That's right. This is the scene where I return the ring. If you'd ever found time to give me one. Doug, it's not your fault. You are like you and I am like me. It's funny. I can't even reproach you for having asked me to marry you. You didn't. - That was my mistake. This is yours. Be a love now and say goodnight. Before I get sloppy. Goodnight, Paula. You mean, he only weighs ten pounds now? Why, I weighed that when I was born. He might have too, if he'd waited. I'll bet you he's going to be crazy about baseball. Of course he will. He is exactly like you. I bet he looks more like you. - He does not. Did I tell you the doctor put him on cereal? So soon? Say, I'll bet by next summer we'll be able to take him .. We'll take him to the circus. He'll love the clowns. He laughed out loud today. You know, that's really wonderful for his age. Time is up. I'll see you soon, darling. Mr Madison has all kinds of new plans. Sure, sure. Tell little George that his daddy .. Loves you both. - Let's go. Hiya, Doug. Hi, doc. Be with you in a minute. You know, Doug. I had a patient once. The prettiest girl you ever saw. I fell in love with her. Of course, she was only five and she loved everybody. We had a lot of games we used to play until I lost her. I couldn't have saved her but I felt responsible. I wanted to quit. To hide. To go away. Doc, I don't want to go away to hide. I've just got to go someplace else to start all over again. But why? It's a few months since the Braden trial and you've stuck them out. People soon forget. You'll find new clients. Then let's just say I'd rather start over again someplace else, huh? But you'll take it with you, Doug. You can't run away from how you feel. Doc, we have been over it and over it. Yes. I do get boring, don't I. Is this the stuff going to storage? - Yep. They will pick it up tomorrow. I'll let you know when I decide where I'm going to settle. Let's get on down to the depot, shall we? It's nowhere near train time. - I'd like to get on down there. Alright. I'll buy you a whiskey sour. It beats penicillin all hollow. By the way, Doug. If you get any unpaid bills. I mean bills that you didn't have time to take care of, I'd be glad to .. Thanks, Doc. You are the greatest. No. I've sold everything and paid everything. I don't owe anybody anything. Except Braden. Come on, Doug. You did everything you could. There must have been something else. Something I didn't do, didn't think of. Like what? You shadowed Verne night and day and he didn't lead you to the money. You tried to appeal. It was denied. You went to the governor and he wouldn't grant a stay. Now, what more could you do? Hang for him? Yeah, yeah. Well. Say goodbye to Ellen for me. She'll be with us. Not that I was exactly afraid to leave her at home alone. But I thought tonight .. Well, I had her with me in my calls. Mrs Matthews is taking care of the baby. Open up. Did Mr Madison see the governor again? But it wasn't any use. We're changing your cell now, George. To the death cell? I'll run across to the depot Doug and pick up your ticket. That isn't necessary, Doc. That is to leave us alone together. I'm supposed to talk you out of going away. Poor Doc. I'd like to try. But I can't. I know how you feel. Maybe It will be easier somewhere else. Oh. Sorry folks. What will it be? One whisky sour. You're George Braden's wife, ain't you? I've seen your picture. And you are that lawyer. Well. He's certainly been a friend to you. I tried to pin it on that creep, Verne. So you think he did it? - How can you tell when they're sluggy? The way I figure it .. He is no good to himself or to anybody else. So why shouldn't he take the rap? The way I feel about a crime like that .. I don't think Mrs Braden would care to discuss it tonight. Why tonight? Say, that's right. They hang him tomorrow. Would you rather we waited over at the station, Ellen? I'm alright. Go ahead and have your drink. Gosh. I am sorry, Mrs Braden. It is only that that psycho gripes me. The way he was acting. I went straight to the cops. Like they found, it seems he gets into a tizzy over anything that's exciting. Let alone, hearing about a couple of murders. I can see your point. Now, if you don't mind .. Oh, sure. I get a buzz out of needling him though. The way he goes for anything is a yuk. But I don't like him screaming around at 6 o'clock in the morning. I live upstairs and I need my sleep. 6 o'clock? He knew about the murders at 6 o'clock? Yes. Ain't that what I said? Now think. How can you be sure it was 6 o'clock? Because my missus was getting up. She's been getting up at 6 o'clock every morning since the kids were born. Why? What is eating you both? The bodies weren't discovered until 7:30. Holy cow. Then Verne did do it. You're right. If you're only right. Now, wait a minute. I read the statements you made to the district attorney. You said .. Max Verne was around early before the bar opened. Well, wasn't it? Are you sure it was 6 o'clock? Are you really sure? I got a wife and three kids that will swear to it. Find Doc. Tell him I'll take his car. I'm going up to the Sager farm to find Verne. Phone the sheriff. Tell him what you told us and where I'll be. And tell him to get there fast. This I am going to like. Hello? Is Sheriff Bell there? Hello. - Give me a shot. 35 cents. A friend of yours was just in. Too bad you missed him. Who? Who was in? That lawyer. Madison. The one who tried to railroad you. Nobody railroaded me. They know I didn't do nothing. I guess he just wanted to check. To make sure you were here. Why? Why would he want to do that? Maybe it's because of that good-looking woman of yours. What about her? What's he got to do with her? Plenty, to hear him talk. Anyhow, he's on his way out there. He ain't. You're making it up. That is where he said he was going. Of course, I don't know how you could protect your interests against his. And keep your woman. I'll keep my woman alright. I'll keep my woman. Hello. Sheriff Bell. Quick. [ Door knocks ] Oh .. it's you. Is Verne here? You can see he ain't. Where is he? Why would I tell you? You tried to sell him up the river. What do you care? You said you didn't like him. It's better than raising my old man's kids. Look. It's important. Tell me where he is. Maybe I will. And maybe I won't. What is your name? Gracie. Listen to me, Gracie. Verne did kill those people. You wouldn't want an innocent man to hang for that crime, would you? If he is a man .. he ain't innocent. Most of them need hanging. Gracie, listen to me. I am listening. - I've got to find Verne. So you can string him up? Who would buy me anything then? I will. What do you want? A dream dress. And earrings. Big ones. - You've got them. Now tell me. Where is Max Verne? I want to see the earrings first. Don't you understand? A man dies tomorrow for a crime he didn't commit. You can save him. Why should I? I think I understand. You've had it rough. Nobody never did anything for you, so .. You don't care about anybody. Maybe I could. Tell me where Verne is and .. I'll buy you what you want tomorrow .. Can I pick the earrings? And the dress too. We will shop together. Will you take me dancing? Anywhere. Only tell me. You get rough and I won't tell you nothing. I'm not sore, Gracie. I'm desperate. If Verne is out of town it might take me too long to find him. He ain't out of town. He'll be back here tonight? Maybe. You can wait. And watch the cops. Drop it, Verne. Fred Morgan. That's what he did it for alright. And this is what he did it with. Get him on his feet, Sheriff. Give me the money though. The money is mine. He owed it to me. I had to kill him. But I'll kill you too. I'll kill all of you. I'll have you! I am glad you ain't shy. You might have forgot the earrings. I want that money. Give me my money. I want my money. Doug. I don't know how to thank you. I've been wrong. Very wrong. You've saved me from hanging an innocent man. Never mind that. Get a stay of execution fast. I've already done that. I saw to it as soon as I was notified. Thank you, Doug. Ellen called me. Doug, I was so worried. Braden is getting a reprieve from the governor. And if you want a reprieve from me, all you have to do is ask. Move over. ..r-o..
