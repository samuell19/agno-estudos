We will take all day. I'm sorry. I left in a hurry. What are you going to say to your father? No be. -I'm worried. -With what? He will be angry.

Six bases for the end of this war drug. Did you hear about the peasant girl in Morasivka? She took a coat left by a Jew. And found nine diamonds inside the fabric. It is nothing compared to how much these parasites stole from us. You can't go to church like that. I don't use it anymore. You can unsheath the bar. This man respects nothing. Even on Sundays, he gets dirty as a pig.

Tomorrow I will go to the locksmith shop to buy some tiles. You should take the boys. You know how they like it there. The Germans surrounded Stalingrad. It will be over soon. So the old locksmith has a radio. You'll see. The Germans will find it and kill him. Maybe krauts aren't as smart as we think. Everyone out of the house! Vista-se! Or let's fire it! I said get out! R�pido! Quick, bitch! They cry like little girls. If they spend a month with me, I become real partisans. Come in! Go, go! Come on! -Cad the meat? -We only have plantations. Don't lie to me, you tramp. We store potatoes and carrots in bags. 40 kilos. They can take ... This one-eyed Jew would only love to dig a hole in your head! I got it! We're wasting time. You're going to join your dog. It's true! Shoot him. I'll take you! I knew it! You two, follow me. Lying pig! Leave that bag of shit a . We'll be back. Let's go. Thank God that we are not German. They would have left you with nothing. Let's go. Stay together. -In between. -I'm going. Did you have to open your mouth? I thought they were going to kill him. We do not welcome you for this. N o iam mat -lo. They want to come back for more food. I can't even look at you. It was a less painful death. I don't like rabbits. Learn to like it. N�o d�! Complain to Mania. o Ivan. He can barely stand. Irm�oz�o! I found gold! But he does not forget his own blood. -Where did you get this? - Where's your vodka? Show hospitality! Who took this from? From the most beautiful Jewish girl you've ever seen. It wasn't easy to get into it, but ... It was the best fuck of my life. Boys, get out! Get out! Will you come to my house to talk like that in front of my children? Sorry for not leaving a little for you. But she... She kept screaming! You son of a bitch! Skirt! Skirt! With license. Do you know what's going on? I think so. It happens every month. Are you in pain? A little. This will help. When it gets better, we need more kindling. Got me. We've been looking for this for weeks. The idiot pilot was unable to locate our signal, so he just left it here and left. I'm sorry for your dog. Why did they shoot her? Because he's a tramp. No one supports it. I don't care. I want to go with you. He wouldn't. Ask him. They say he is leaving to form another partisan group. You can join them. Have you killed Germans? How many? Not enough. The eye patch man, is he a Jew? The bear? His real name is Kapinski. I don't think it will last very long. Why no? He is full of hate. It takes many risks. Are you also a Jew? Do you need to be a Jew to hate Germans? It is not easy to kill another human being. Must be yes. If not, why is the forest full of bodies? The rest of the staff are looking for the weapons. You better go. JANEIRO, 1943 ANO NOVO "MALANKA" Welcome! Whatever happened between you two, already in the past! You don't know what he did, what he said in front of my kids! Not me amount. Voc�s s�o irm�os! Pavlo!

My dad died, we were starving, and he had a farm. You don't know anything about me. I know you're as strong as he is. No way. Partisans are made men, hardened. We are not girls like you. Do you think you could kill another human being? You wouldn't be able to do that. You don't know what I'm capable of. You're Jewish, aren't you? How well do you know our prayers and rituals? My best friend begged me to stay in religion class when the British arrived. We've been sitting together since we were six. -Your friend to Mania ... -Romanchuck.

You miserable bum. Put it in my car. Leave the cow! -Thank you sir! -Let's go. Thank you. Thank you sir. This is crazy! Ask Ivan's horses! I won't ask for his help for anything.

What are you going to do with it? What do you want me to do? Get rid of it. N�o. -Get in the car! -Go away now. We will not have our help!
