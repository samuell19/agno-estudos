- Ladies and gentlemen, the tropical Isabella! Isn't she spectacular! - Cool, huh? - Where's the elephant? - She's retired. But you get to see the silly clowns! - The clowns should retire, not the elephant. - And next, coming to the stage! Bring on the clowns! - Hey, Albert. Hey! - Oh, hey! Hey, Dawn! Dawn, come over here! - Hey! - You missed some of the greatest silk drops ever. - That's why they call her The Incredible Isabella. - It's not the same without Flora, it's just not. - No, man, we miss her, we miss her. - She misses you, too. But she's gonna love her new home. 2,900 acres of grazing, barns and water pools everywhere. - Hope I get a place that swanky when I retire. - "Retire." - She'll be lonely at first. But she'll make new friends. Flora's a very sociable elephant. - Yeah, for sure. Sure. - Hey, everyone. So, uh... We're a little short this week. Yeah. The storm wiped out the main road and people stayed home. They missed an incredible performance. - Yeah, it was great, but how short? - I expect word to spread and a full house tomorrow night. You'll all get the rest of your money, okay? - Thanks, Boss. - Three weeks in a row. Look at this. - Something's better than nothing, right? - Yeah, but it's like three weeks of this. - He says it's gonna get better. It'll get better. - You know I have followers all over the world, right? - It's good for stars to have big egos. - And this is not even half. - Every time you eat an apple, who you gonna think of? That's right, me. And every time someone steals an apple when I'm not looking, I'm gonna think of you. Here. Got it? - Sure, just come on in. - "Folks, I'm a little late this week." Of course you are, you keep putting all that money in the elephant who hasn't even performed in a year. How is that fair? Elephant orthotics, $70. - Let's see here. Acrobatic harness, 380. - Well, I am the star of the show, and I am the one people come to see. So... - You are, now that Flora's retired. You're the star. - I refuse to let you bait me. - You should be thanking me. When I don't pay you, you get mad. And when you get mad, you perform better, and when you perform better, you get your name in the paper. Then maybe you'll get some more Instagram followers. - You know, they called me again. That circus from Ashton. Maybe next time I won't hang up. - Hey. Hey, Gabriella, no. It's not too late at all, we just had a show. Oh. Oh, I see. No, I... I understand. - Thank you, Annie. - Hey, don't beat yourself up about the crowd. - I promised Dawn I'd find a home for Flora. - But you did. - Yeah, we're gonna be there soon. - They lost their funding. The preserve director called me and said now they're only accepting sponsored elephants. $200,000. And I don't even have 50 bucks to pay my clowns. - Then we can find another preserve. - Chilipingo was the only one in the whole country. - Well, what about zoos? - I've called every zoo in North America. Nobody wants an old elephant with arthritis. - Well, then what? - What do you think? What am I supposed to do? You can't walk an elephant around the neighborhood. They don't curl up at the foot of your bed! - Yeah, that's good. - Oh, Milo, you outdid yourself this time. - Hey, you know, most people add the garlic and thyme too soon, what you have to do is wait for the butter to foam and start to turn brown. Thank you. - Hey, Milo. Your cottage cheese casserole was perfect last night, but, this omelet's even better. - Thank you, Dawn, you know, it's nice to know a barbarian palette is not a Jacobs family trait. How far is that preserve again? - 320 miles, we'll be there in six days. - Henry, it's your favorite. - No, thanks. Dawn, when you're done with breakfast, can I speak with you? - Okay. - Oh hey, sweetheart. You know, Flora's in pain. You've seen her walk around. Her arthritis is only gonna get worse. You know, I love her, too. But she's had a good life, a long life. 53 years. It's the kindest thing we could do for her. - Whatever, Dad. - Um... Well, I think, I, um... I might have made a mistake. - I can't right now. I'm sending her away. - Away? What do you mean away? - She's gonna stay with her aunt, Cathy, in Santa Rosa. She doesn't wanna be here when the vet comes. I'm gonna miss you. Everything's gonna be alright. - I know. - Do you have your ticket? - Yeah, it's right here. - Okay. - Welcome aboard. Watch your step. - Let's hear it for the hilarious Bob and Barnaby! And now, coming to the stage. The Incredible Isabella! - Hey, beautiful. Such a good girl. Let's go. Come here. Come on, Flora. Come on! - Get ready. - Let's hear it for these hilarious clowns! - Cathy! I can't... What do you mean she's not on the train? She texted me that she arrived over an hour ago. Okay, I'll call you back. Come on. Dawn, where are you? - Henry! - Cover for me! - Alright. We're good, Flora, come on. Come on, Flora. - Dawn! Dawn! Dawn! Where are you, honey? It's dad. I want you to know that... We canceled the vet and Flora can stay with us. Until we find her a new home. I just, I really, I need you to come home. I'm, I'm so sorry. Please, I love you. Okay, call me back. - Flora the elephant has just performed her most amazing stunt. Saturday night, Flora snuck out of her tent, accompanied by 14-year-old Dawn Jacobs. The elephant was spotted taking a late-night stroll down Main Street by a local resident walking her dog. Flora is part of the Ocotillo Circus, currently performing in Tapos. Authorities are confident they'll find Flora soon because, well, she's an elephant. Police are putting out an APB on this four-ton runaway. - Has anybody reported seeing an elephant? - As a matter of fact, someone did. - Well, that's my elephant. - Why was your elephant wandering Main Street at 11 o'clock? - Nobody's up to any good at that time of night. - My daughter ran away. - The elephant was searching for her? - No, she ran away with the elephant. - Henry's been looking for both of them all night. - And they're not back at the circus? - No, I wouldn't be here if they were. - I'll put a few of my people right on it. - Thank you so much, Sheriff. - If she's run off with a Chihuahua, it'd take a day or two. But she ran off with an elephant, so, expect a call within an hour. - Thank you. Mm-mm. - Hey. Hey. I know how much you like your sleep, but, gotta keep going, okay? Did Dad really think I'd go to Santa Rosa and leave you? Hey. Come on, let's go. - Flora the circus elephant and her 14-year-old companion, Dawn, still have not been located. If you happen to see Flora bathing in your pool, there's a $1,000 reward. - Are we staying here? - Relax. Why should we be nervous? If you did your job well, nobody saw you. Did you do it well? Show me. Not here! Go around, not here, what's wrong with you? What's that? You made me wait 20 minutes for this? What's wrong with you? Go get me a cellphone or something better! Get me a cellphone! Go! - Hey, guys, gather round, one last thing. - What's goin' on, Boss? - Okay. I don't expect this to take more than a day or two, but, if we can't stay on schedule, then we have to cancel the next stop. Don't worry, 'cause you're all still getting paid. - It's not about the money. - It's cool. Don't worry about it. - Yeah, you're good, man, go find Dawn. - Family first, man. - Thank you, guys, I really appreciate your support. I'll call Isabella with updates. Thanks, guys. - No problem, man. - I'm going with him. I'll call you guys with updates, okay? - I don't need your help. This is not open for discussion. - You're right, it's not. Get in. - Buckle up. - Keep it coming, girl. It's kinda hot, huh? Come on, look. Here's some water. Ready? Alright. Come here. There we go. Is that good for you? A little bit more. There we go. Are you good? There we go. Like that? - Leave me alone! Get off of me! - Give it to me! - Hey, leave him alone! Hey, leave him alone! Hey, get off of him! Come on, Flora. - Give it to me. Give it to me. - Get off of him. - I'm calling the police. - Let's go, Flora. Come on, Flora! - Come on! This way takes us further from the road. This way. - What've you got? What's funny? - You just sound like someone I know. - Let me see. Cabbage and spinach? You got cabbage and spinach? - It's all he had. - Why didn't you rob a farm that grows something good, like strawberries? - Can we put this in the elephant's pack? - Her name is Flora. Bend down, Flora. Come on, girl. There you go. It's a little rocky. Okay, in you go. What's your name? - Sebastian. - I'm Dawn. Well? - What? - Aren't you gonna ask me why I'm traveling with an elephant? - You're famous, all over TV. - Let's go. Come on, Flora. Come on! Come on, girl. Did the news say where I was headed? - Just that you ran away. - It's no secret. There's an elephant preserve in Chilipingo. - You know how far that is? And what about the mountain? - Saw it on the map. - You do realize how big that is? If she can't do circus tricks, what makes you think she can climb a mountain? - Flora's ancestors crossed the Alps with the Roman general Hannibal. I don't think she's worried about a rinky dink-- - Right. Hey! - Come on, girl. Thanks for the spinach. - Thanks for the bread. - Bye. - Pleasure to make your acquaintance. Let me come with you. - No chance. - Part of the way? - Why? - My penance. Stealing is wrong and I wanna do a good deed like help a lost girl and her elephant. - You lie. - My penance for lying. - Goodbye. - You know why I wanna help? Flora's scared away that farmer, I owe you guys. - We don't need help. - What if you get bitten by a scorpion? - I know what to do. - Scorpions don't bite, they sting. - I knew that. - No, you didn't, but I do. I know the mountain that you're headed to is 11,000 feet, and there's only one road through. I know what berries you can eat and what you can't. I know how to hide when people are searching for me. - Oh, like the cops looking for you now? - Hey, I've only been to jail once, what about you? - Are you serious? Never. Obviously. - Not so obvious. I've never stole anything as big as Flora. The biggest thing I've stolen was a truck. - I didn't steal Flora. - The circus let you take her? - They were going, why am I even talking to you? - Don't worry. Elephant larceny is only a misdemeanor in this county. - Oh, you think you're funny? - Hey, if you're gonna travel 300 miles with a boy, wouldn't you want him to be funny? - Oh my god, I'm not traveling 300 miles with a boy. Especially if that boy is you. I'm saying goodbye right here. Come on, Flora. - You're right. The cops will be after me, that's why I don't wanna go back. I thought we could help each other out. But you want to go into the barren, rattlesnake-infested desert alone, that's cool. Bye. - Hey, Sebastian. - Yes? - You can stay with us for one more hour. - Let's go. - He's testing me. - What if they make it to the preserve? - Well, we'll find them first. - But I'm just saying, what if they make it to the preserve? They'll be turned away, they still don't have the money. - But we will find her, right? - Yes. Yes, we'll find her. - Hey, can I see that? Thank you. You alright? After I finish setting up this fire, gonna get some rest, alright? Sound good to you? I love you. That's my girl. - I told you there's only one road over the mountain. - It's the fastest way. - If you go to Sabinas, you can head north from there, and go around the mountain. - That's the way they expect me to go. - You should listen to me. ♪ Wasted words can find a home ♪ - Alright, we gotta get going. - I know.

There's more than one? - They travel in packs. - They're closer than before. - Are you afraid of coyotes? - No, of course not. - They don't harm people. - Yeah, I know that. - They're probably just talking about Flora. "Hey. "What's that big gray animal by the fire over there?" - "No idea, dude." - "You should go check it out." - "I'm not checking it out, you check it out." - "Let's get outta here and find ourselves a rabbit." - I just can't believe she's out there. - You know, you really underestimate her. She's much more resilient than you think. Not to mention Flora. Who'd wanna mess with Flora? This is a good picture, what do you think about this one? - Awesome. - It's a good one, right? Should I post it? - Yes, absolutely. - Hashtag... Life on the road. - Hello? Hello? Hold on. Hello? Yeah, I can hear you. They did? Where? We'll be right there. - What happened? - She was spotted. - Great, let's go! - Yeah. - It's gonna be okay. This is good, this is good. What else did he say? - They spotted an elephant with a little girl. At this farm. He's gonna send me the address. - Okay, okay, you drive, I do this. - She couldn't have made it this far in that amount of time. - Is it possible you underestimate your daughter? - Yes, he does. - I was talking about Flora. - Mr. Suarez claims that Dawn and the elephant ran off with a teenage boy who stole his cabbages. - Well, this just gets better and better! - Forgive him, what else can you tell us? - There's not much more information right now. I've got my guys searching the entire county. - Who is this kid? - We don't know who the boy is right now. - Flora's on TV! - Oh my gosh. - After six days, searchers still haven't located Flora the runaway circus elephant and 14-year-old Dawn Jacobs. They were spotted earlier outside the farm of Javier Suarez. - I caught a boy stealing my crop, so I went to go stop him, and then that's when the elephant came out of nowhere. It stood up in the air. If I didn't run from that elephant it would have crushed me. - Flora wouldn't hurt a fly. - Who let that buffoon on television? Everyone's gonna think she's a threat. - Picture yourself crushing a big fat dung beetle with a giant fly swatter. Yeah, that's how easy this job's gonna be for me. I promise you. Okay, thank you. Bob, got some bad news, I know how much pride you take in decorating the home front here, but we gotta move Mick. - We gotta move Mick? - We gotta move Mick. Sorry, Mick. You've been good to us, you've been faithful, but we got a new head comin' in, a bigger and better head. We got ourselves an elephant. - Elephant? - Don't worry, Keith, you're not goin' anywhere. There's an elephant marauding through the desert, threatening persons and property. - So we're hired to kill it? - Well, he said something about a tranquilizer dart, but, then my phone got funky and I would have swore I heard him say, "Runyon, I want you to stalk that elephant. "I want you to shoot it dead and then I want you "to put its head on the wall of your home." So, that's what I'm gonna do. - But won't Kieth get lonely? - Kieth? Kieth won't even notice the difference. Oh, Kieth. God bless him. - How long has your dad owned a circus? - Well, he started off as a candy butcher. Those are the people who sell cotton candy and stuff. Yeah, they called him the Handsome Henry. - Handsome Henry. - He bought the Ocotillo Circus 16 years ago, and I was born on the road in a town called El Capitan. We had a show that same night. The tightrope walker needed a prop, so he carried me. - What? - Geez, I'm kidding! You take it so seriously. - So, do you guys travel all year long? - Spring till fall. My dad says the circus is a city without a zip code. - A city without a zip code. - Mm-hm. - That's where I wanna live. I should join the circus! - What's your act? - Who's the guy that says, "ladies and gentlemen, "welcome to the most amazing show on Earth." - That's the ringmaster. - Oh. - That's my dad's job. - Well, I could be a clown. - Remember when I told you you're not funny? - Oh, yeah, back when you said you wouldn't travel 300 miles with a boy like me. - Hey, you're still on a trial period, alright? Settle down. - Alright. - Okay. Right, small. Just about the size you'd expect from a 14-year-old girl. - Bob. - I think we found 'em, man. - Bob, those are human footprints there. - Huh? Oh, hey, hey, look over here. We got another set of prints a little bigger. No, no, it's not them. Unless the girl's travelin' with a friend. - Bob, wouldn't it be better to focus on these big, round elephant footprints, huh? - Elephant prints? - Yeah. - Yeah, huh, you make a good point, man. Can't deny it. Yeah, Runyon. Oh, that's a good one. Yep. - They are somewhere in this desert. My volunteers will find her. - Well, they're going here. - Chilipingo. - Yeah, it's an elephant preserve. - You see that mountain, it's 11,000 feet. - They'll never make it over that. They'll have to go around. - We're gonna find Dawn, Mr. Jacobs. We're gonna find her real soon. - Thank you. - That a girl. How're you doin'? - Shh, check this out. Trust me. Go on, I'll catch up. - You sure? - Go. - Alright, alright. - Stay quiet. - You know, when I have trouble sleepin', I just count my trophies. Black rhino, white rhino, hippopotamus, zebra, giraffe, grizzly bear, black bear, lion, tiger, leopard, panther, jaguar. - So, uh, what's the plan tomorrow? - It's a simple plan, really. One, locate the elephant. Two, kill the elephant. Three, place the elephant's head on the wall. Gonna be a big day. - Are you sure they were talking about Flora? - Positive, I was three feet away from their tent. - Why would they wanna kill her? Why would anyone wanna kill an elephant? I... - I don't know. But they do, and they have quads. Look, we can't sleep here for long. - I'm cold! I can't walk anymore. - Dawn! We can't stay here! - You don't have to stay with us! Go. Don't let us slow you down. - Alright, alright, we'll take a break. Hey. - I can't do this. - Hey. Hey, you fooled them! You snuck Flora out of the circus! Dawn, you saved her life, you're brave, you're smart. You wanna take her to the preserve, I know, I know you will. Come on. - Fine. - Alright, let's go. - Come on, Flora. Flora! Flora! Flora! - Try some of this? Oh, hey. Good morning. - Morning. - Want some? So how'd you sleep? - Good. We gotta go. Let's go, Flora. Come on. Come on, girl. - Come on, Flora. Let's go, girl. - I should have known she'd never get on that train without Flora. - She fooled us all. - She shouldn't have fooled me. I had a clue. - What clue? - I know that Dawn is just like her mother. - You never talk about her. - Sophia. She was Flora's trainer. She loved Flora like she was another daughter. When she got diagnosed with breast cancer, she fought so hard. She always took care of Flora, right up to the end. So, when she died, I... Dawn took over. And they've been inseparable. - Hey, where do you think you're goin'? - Find Dawn and Flora. - We thought you'd say that. - Get in! - Hey. - Huh? - Where's the guns? That elephant's gonna pay. Whoa. - There it is! - It's a lot bigger in person. How deep do you think the water is? - Hard to say. Thanks. - What if it's too deep for Flora? - Oh, she's a great swimmer. Hey, I'll find a more narrow crossing. - No, no, no, we cross here. - We'll find somewhere else. It looks much further than it looked at first. I can't swim that far. - You're just saying that so I don't feel like a loser. - Come on! - I can do it. - We'll find a better place. - Dawn, the hunters! - Come on, we gotta go, we can do this! Let's go, Flora! - There's the elephant! - Huh? - Come back! Okay. Say goodnight, sweetheart. Okay, here we go. - Come on! Almost there! - I got it! - Well, don't look at me! - What do you mean he hasn't called the hunters off? - What? - No, that's not what happened, he said they fired two shots at Dawn while she was in the river! Call the big game hunters off! - Okay. Okay. Take a deep breath. - I slept so good, I don't even remember my dreams. - I can't believe I slept so long. - You were tired. - Yeah, I guess. - Probably had a hard time falling asleep. Thinking about all that reward money. Your friend should be proud. You totally had me fooled. Especially with that speech in the rain. "You're gonna make it to that preserve, Dawn. "I know you are." - Dawn, please. - Leave, Sebastian. - I sent those texts the first day. - You wanted me to go to Sabinas. - Yeah, I didn't-- - That's where your friend was waiting. - I didn't know you then, but now I... Please let me help, I wanna help. - Stop lying. - You have to believe me. Please believe me? - Leave, Sebastian! - Dawn. Dawn-- - Leave now. Hey. You ready? Let's go, Flora. I trust Dad, he decides to kill you. I trust Sebastian, he wants to collect a $1,000 reward. Time I learned my lesson, huh? Stop trusting people. Come on, girl. Got a long distance today. - Runyon here. Yes, sir. I understand. The elephant's no longer in Herschel County, so, it's out of his jurisdiction. - So what, the hunt's over? - Unless the elephant comes back to Herschel County. - Yeah, but why would the girl lead it back to where they came? - Well, we could promise her an elephant ear umbrella, or... - Hey! - Hey, Fernando! Hey, what's up, man? - What's wrong with you? - Hey, hey, Fernando. - You don't answer my texts. - There was no service. - Where is my elephant? - They got away, they got away when I was sleeping! - Watch yourself. Get my elephant. Get my elephant! - Hey, hey! Quickly! - Okay, that's 18.38. - Oh, sorry. Keep the change. - Thank you! - Thanks! - Thank you. - Hello? Yeah, I saw a poster about a girl and an elephant. Says there's a reward? Yeah, yeah, I saw them, they're in Sabinas. Sabinas. Did you write that down? Okay, I have to hang up now 'cause I have to catch a plane. Alright, okay. - Hey, we got a sighting in Sabinas, move out. - Right. Gonna go in here. Okay, come on, Flora. Come on. That a girl. Alright, we're gonna stop here for the night. - Dawn! Don't be scared, you and Flora have to leave. - I'm sorry, I fell asleep. - I want you to stay, but my dad saw you and called someone. - Thank you. - Hey, it's not deer season. - Oh, we're huntin' bigger game than that. - Elephant? - Have you seen the elephant? - Do you have permits for these rifles, sir? - What kind of a game warden wears a Hawaiian shirt? - Have you got a permit for that idiot, sir? - That's funny, but if you don't mind, we're here on official government business, so-- - We do mind. - Oh boy, oh boy. Yeah, yeah. - The hunt's over. - Why'd you stand there while they were breakin' my gun, flossin' you teeth? - Sorry, man. Dental hygiene's important. - A barn, where? I thought they were in Sabinas? - Oh, an elite force, you said, huh? "They know this area like the back of their hand!" - When we got to the barn, they were gone. But take a look at this. - What? I'll call you back. - Oh my god. - Somebody likes apples. Good, that elephant loves apples. We've gotta get all the apples. - All the apples, got it. - Alright, Bob. - Yep. - This is our first date. You gotta make a good impression on a first date. - That's what I'm told, yeah. - It's our last date, too. - Right, right, 'cause we're gonna kill the elephant. - Well, I am. - Well, yeah, yeah. Hey, can I have one? - Yeah. Worm, worm, here. - Oh, thanks, man! - Oh my god, oh my god. - That's good! - Come on, hurry. - That's really good! - You're sickening. Flora, come on. Flora, Flora, come on! Come on. Come on. Keep on coming. Wait, no, no! No, no. No. Wait one second, Flora! Are you okay, Flora? - Dawn! Whoa. Are you hurt? - Who cares? I don't! - I'm getting rope. - No, no, call the cops first! Make sure I don't run away and deprive you of your money. - I need rope. Okay. Watch your head! Put it around. - I know what to do. Get Flora to help! - What command do I use to make her walk? - She's not a dog. Tell her what you want, she'll understand. - Okay. Okay. Okay, Flora. Hey, I can't Dawn up from that ledge. I can't get Dawn up from that ledge without your help, okay? Come on, Flora. Get Dawn up from that ledge, let's go. Come on, girl. That's it. - Hey. Hey. Hey, I am so sorry. I thought it was over. You did so good, such a good girl, right? You're such a good girl. Hey. Eat up, alright? - You said apples were her favorite. - That a girl. Searchers will be out soon. - They're wasting their time. Did you steal the bike? - No. - The food? - No. I stole the money that I used to buy them. - Ah, there it is! - I stole them from the man who texted me about Flora. He calls himself my uncle. I steal for him, or, or he beats me. And sometimes he beats me 'cause he likes to. I don't have a dad. So don't lose yours. - Woo! - We made it! Woo-hoo-hoo! - I am so proud of you. Woo! Woo-hoo-hoo! - My leg's starting to ache, you know what that means right? - We get to kill the elephant. - I get to kill the elephant. - Yeah, right, yeah. Yeah, you get to kill the elephant. - And it's close. Can you feel it? It's really close. - I think I can feel it. - There it is! Just kidding. Flora. Hey, girl. Shh. - Hey, stop banging around back there! - Yeah! - I don't want any bruises on my trophy! - I need you to rock, alright? Rock, that a girl. - You know, I'm gonna pull over and tie that beast down. - That makes sense. - Okay, here we go. Quiet! Quiet down, old lady! - Noisy. - Alright, you get up there. I'll get you some rope. - Wait, wait, up there? - Are you kidding? I have to do everything? - What's goin' on? Oh, wow. How'd the elephant learn how to drive? Oh, that's gotta hurt. - My leg's broken. - Well, looks like that elephant bagged herself a big game hunter, huh? - That's funny. - Yeah. - You laugh again, your head's gonna end up on the wall between Mick and Kieth, you got it? - I got it. - Oh, that elephant! - Hey, excuse me, sir? Yeah, um, can you tell me how to get to the elephant preserve from here? Come on. - How did you get this? We're gonna make it. We're gonna make it! - Woo! Yes! - The cops are behind us. - Come on, girl, you're almost home. - What about the money? - We've come so far. They wouldn't dare turn her away. - Go, go, go, go! We got this. You got this. - Alright, Flora. - We made it. - Sir, sir, that's my daughter driving. There's an elephant in there. She's gonna let it out, just give it some room, guys. - Look, look. - Alright, come on, Flora. Come on, Flora. - And here they are, Dawn and Flora. After a grueling 320-mile journey, they have reached the gates of the Chilipingo Elephant Preserve. - Who are all these people? - They're here to see you and Flora! - Dawn. Dawn, it's great to meet you. You've been quite a journey. - Uh, I've been thinking about Flora's fee. I can't pay it all at once, but maybe I could work here, for free, you don't-- - No. Flora's fee has been paid. - Wait, what? - In fact, Flora's journey has helped raise enough to sponsor four new elephants in addition to Flora. - People all over the world have been following your journey through The Incredible Isabella's Instagram account. - Thank you. - I'm so proud of you. You're amazing. - I'm so glad you're safe. - I, um... I heard your voicemail. Thank you. - So why didn't you come home? - It would have never been fair. You can't afford to keep Flora. Oh, uh, Dad, Isabella, this is Sebastian. Couldn't have done it without him. - Sebastian, thank you, thank you so much. - Dawn says you were the greatest candy butcher of all time. - "The greatest of all time," he sounds like a ringmaster. - Yeah, that's your job, but I could be a clown. - Yeah, he's not funny. - I'll start as a candy butcher. - More like you'll hot-wire the cotton candy machine. See? Flora. You've made a new friend already? - Maybe not so new. - What? - Well, I've been lookin' into Flora's history. Flora was shipped from Malaysia to New York in 1983, and from there, she went to a circus in Wichita, Kansas. Flora's friend is named Samantha. She's been with us for 16 years. She was two when we got her, from the circus in Wichita. - The same one? - I was able to track down someone who used to work there. She clearly remembers an elephant giving birth shortly before the circus closed. That elephant was sold to the Ocotillo Circus. The elephant's baby came to us. Dawn. I wanna introduce you to Flora's daughter, Samantha. - Hey, Samantha. - Wow. - Hi. Hi, Samantha. - You're beautiful. - Ladies and gentlemen!
