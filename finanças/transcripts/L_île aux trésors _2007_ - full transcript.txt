Damn it, man. Doctor! And this one died. Damn it. Livsi... Livsi! Give me a sip of your drink. It's not a hand anymore, it's a rope. Livsi! Don't you dare fool around! If you cut off my wing, I'm gonna punch my head in. Let's get to work. Did you wash the wound? Uh, uh... No. Now, now, now... It's gonna get easier. Uh, doctor... - Well, what else? Weren't you going to have a hand? Don't question the diagnosis in front of the patient! You want to say something, you say it afterwards, alone. Do you understand? Careful, the blood will bleed! Gerard Junio Alice Taglioni Jean-Paul Rove B>Completion STRUCTURES The film was also filmed: Michael Kalkin, Vincent Rottier and others Fabienne Suarez, Sion Marciano. Operator: Wilco Filak Composer: Nicolas Dode Producer: Jean Pierre Ramsey-Levy Director: Alain Berberian Seven years later Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! The devil's giblets! - I'm sorry, Father. Your reverend... Better give me your hand. and help me get up. I'm sorry, Father. Where are they enlisting here for military service? Course heading west, second port side house. Thank you, Father. Go in peace, my son. Asshole. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! My name is Hawkins. Jim Hawkins. I want to be the young man on the ship under His Majesty's command. How old are you, kid? 15. I can read and swim. A little bit. I haven't gone to sea yet. but my mother kept a hotel in port. and the sailors taught me everything, listen: Sails off! Daily - on the bridge! Give me the mooring, full ahead! Well, young man, sign it, and you're in His Majesty's service. When do we sail? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm Jim Hawkins. It's here, Father. Open up, Hawkins. You're responsible for the safety of the priest while he communicates with the convict. Yes, Sergeant! I'm innocent! I did nothing! I'm sorry, Sergeant, you promised to talk to the colonel? I remember, Hawkins. I was hired by the ship, Sergeant. You're in the King's service. Rejoice at it. Providence, my son, trust in providence. Destined to be a young man, you will be! Thank you, Father. Amen. Open up, we'll try to get it together. the wretched wreckage, until he went down. - Mr. Hawk! Mr. Hawk, there's a priest here to see you. Oh, fuck him, so he can get on a stake! Father, he's hopeless. Hope is the last to die. Let me say a few words to him. My son, your death is near. Don't you have anything else to tell who came to you like a brother? It's me, Silver. before you go. on the way down the last road. There's nothing he can do, he won't listen to you. Maybe we should respect a man's wishes, who has until morning to live. Who's talking about the man? It's a beast in a cage. If there's any soul left in it, she's hiding in such a way that you can't dig it up anymore. That's not true, Father. Sailors are not animals, they are kind people. They could be executed, but no one won't make them disown. from their beliefs in the name of foreign beliefs. Providence, my son, providence. I'll see you again. Baby, open the door. You can trust me. Open it if you want to swim. I've been crying. Here you go, baby. I don't need it anymore. And you'll get lucky. Old Flint gave it to me before he died. Captain Flint himself? Yes. The best tobacco from the Antilles. Smell it. Smells like naked natives. No, thanks, it's your... Take it, I say. If you want to be a sailor, chew tobacco! Well done! Now, listen to old Hawk. I was Captain Flint's right hand. Are you listening to me? Yes, it's tobacco... I'm listening, I'm just a little... Well, here we go. There were: Flint, me and the third sailor. More cunning than Flint, but less experienced. Dangerous type. Silver. A rattlesnake with a wooden leg. My best friend at sea, on land and in hell. A snake with a wooden leg? If you interrupt, I won't have time to tell you anything. No... It's just that... Monk, he's got a wooden leg. What's the big deal? Well, uh... a monk... What's with the monk? I'm talking about Silver and Flint Island! Does Silver know where the island is? He knows about the island. But where the treasure is, he doesn't know! The monk and Silver... I know where the treasure is buried. I was with Flint when he died. And then I didn't tell Silver anything, because I got caught! If I didn't make it, you're going on a swim now. Flint's treasure! They're bringing it in! To the road! Killer Repent! Let me through! Repent, my son! The hour has come, it's time for repentance! Silver... Officer, I want to confess. Cleanse myself of my sins before they hang me up. It's too late. Executioner! I repent! A stronger noose, executioner! Don't repeat my mistakes! Don't waste the treasure God gave you. Yes, soul, that's a treasure too! Hidden in the depths of our hearts. To get to him, you have to hike up a steep slope the highest mountain in the world... Amen! The highest mountain. Yeah. And when you get up there, look right at the light. He's heading south. Amen. The light is directed south. Go ahead. Go ahead. One step. Two steps. What the hell! Tavern Uh, uh... Come on, let's play. Good evening. I'm looking for Mr. Silver. Is he coming later? Have you seen him, Captain? Mr. Silver, John Silver. What can I get you, soldier? No need, I'm looking for Mr. Silver. Maybe you know him under a different name. He is an old sailor with a wooden leg. Leg cut off above the knee, very limp. What foot? With a wooden... What foot?! Taking the dead? I think it's a little big for you. I swear, Hawk gave it to me. And I told you to find you. Providence, my son, providence! Here we are, by the way. The treasure! I know where Flint's treasure is! Shh! Quiet! Don't talk. I'm gonna ask, and you don't talk. Head nod, yes or no. Understand? You know, somewhere, you know what? The captain's treasure... Shut your mouth. Got a map? With yourself? You could say so. Better not talk about it here. Do you know the locks at the slaughterhouse? Come over there in an hour. Go on. Will you take me to find out what you're looking for? Will you take it? We can't do without such a young woman! Oh, yeah, of course. You were right, captain. About the providence. Who is destined to swim - will float. Got what? Nothing. Nothing. If you've got him, you're dead. He's the only one who knows where the map is. Get out of here so he can't see you! Get out! My son, wake up. How are you? The ship's tilted a little bit, but I'm on course. Look, I saved your life. They would have drowned you. Nothing was stolen from you? Do you still have the map? It cannot be stolen. You don't have it with you? It's right here. I remember her. Well, what's up? It's empty. At all? I don't understand anything. That's very strange, like I had a hole in my head. Listen, son. I know about holes. Unless you want an extra hole in your head. I advise you not to darken. Draw the damn map! It's all a bruise, the memory will come back. You just have to stop thinking about the map. You'd be better off if he came back. Don't go anywhere. I know where the map is. And where is it? Count on me. Miss Baroness! Baroness Treloni! Do you recognize me? Jim. Jim Hawkins. My mother kept a hotel on your land. I just have to put my land on the line, to see your cards. What lands? You still have something left, which is not yet a guarantee Sir. [Laughs] If I don't pay you back in six months I give my word to the witnesses that Treloni's estate will go into your possession. And a house with 30 windows and eight fireplaces. Of course, in case you win this game honestly. And bail? I gave you my word. You can't imagine anything better. Don't be modest, Baroness. Let's go down to the cellar, maybe you can offer me something else as bail. I didn't question your playing methods. But, uh... (sighs) Looks like you can't be condescending. with crooks like you. If I could pay off all my debts like that. I'm gonna have to scold you a little bit. You came to this brothel in the company of a knife thrower who has a penchant for pirate habits. This is John Silver, madam. A real gentleman of luck. Do you think your mother in heaven is happy about this? That her kid's a friend of these guys? Madam Baroness, I'm sailing away on a real ship to find the real treasure! To your treasure! And you're sure the treasure exists? There is. It's in his head. The young man has too much imagination. Treasure, pirates, flying octopus. Stop making it up! Doesn't the imagination differentiate us from... say, monkeys? You hear that, Captain, they say you lack imagination. I don't want to offend you, madam, but that pretty beast we are distinguished by our ability to speak. So when I have secrets, I share them with a monkey. It's more reliable. Mmmmm... Philosophy? Have a good wind, Jim Hawkins. Jim. You know who's the worst enemy of the flippers? The king's soldiers? Hurricanes? Sharks? Women. Never forget that. Women are deadly enemies of pirates. They want what we want, but they have weapons that we don't have. Captain Silver... you've got the tube upside down. ...Give me that! Isn't that a touching family scene? Baroness. Mr. Silver... it seems... John Silver, Baroness. Young Hawkins gave me an assignment. I can hardly believe it, that you can be entrusted with. Unless you're interested, Mr. Silver. Your handkerchief, Baroness. Keep it. Why am I carrying them with me... I don't cry anymore. Is that your grandfather? This is my late husband. Do you like money, Mr. Silver? I hate them insanely. But poverty terrifies me. Money is often vulgar. But poverty is always... is vile. Money reminds me of my husband. And poverty is about the father. He wasted his fortune and put me to bed to this lovely nobleman. My father used to say money, it's like the wind. When they're gone, we're broke, when there's a lot of them, we're lying in the dust. I knew the wind was strong, but, uh... a lot of money... Women in my position don't accept a man for the sake of to hear his father's wise words. I need the money. And to get it, I prefer to negotiate with the robber, than to follow your husband. The size of your treasure? A treasure? What kind of treasure? I can charter a ship and get permission to sail. in just a couple of days. how much do you appreciate this treasure, Monsieur Silver? Baroness, if the treasure existed... Goodbye, Mr. Silver. Take the gentleman back to the back door. Yes, Baroness. 700,000 pounds sterling. Leave us alone. Do you know the exact location? Baroness, give me the ship and the captain, who loves risk, and I swear, before Christmas. half of what I'm gonna find, I'm gonna put it at your feet. You misunderstood me, Mr. Silver. Half of you don't like it? We'll split it all up on the spot. I'm going with you. Mr. Silver. Ship's cook, if I'm not mistaken? Here you go, guys, what's fame? The gentleman didn't even see me in the eye, and I knew who I was right away. Mr. Silver, I've already announced Baroness Treloni I don't want to take you on a swim. I want you to know about it. Knowledge won't hurt, monsieur. Captain, I present to you of Jason de Werpre's Vicongt. This is Admiral de Vervais' youngest son, who generously borrowed the ship. necessary for our adventure. He kindly agreed to be your assistant. Let me remind myself to Mrs. Baroness, that the choice of an assistant belongs to the captain of the ship. Madam Baroness already had the honor without my knowledge to choose of dubious team members. Mr. Smolette. You've been using my husband's trust. so I chose you as captain of the ship. If my trust allows you such a familiar tone, I can find the captain more accommodating. And younger. Allow me, Baroness. What a temperament! Charming! I'm convinced that the captain and I we'll get along quickly. like two pigs at a fair. Isn't that right, captain? Captain Smolette! Captain... I want to offer you my candidacy as a ship's doctor. Doctor, please, sign the contract. Looking at your degrees, I'd like to get sick sooner rather than later. So you can treat me. Remove the mooring! Right rudder! Wish us luck, Hawk! Welcome aboard, Captain Flint. Stop it, why are you being ugly? I'm not kidding this time! My dear lame, isn't there a rum for medics dying of thirst? Livsie? Silver! Jim! Jim! Hold him down, I'll skin him! I've been waiting seven years for this moment! But I was right not to cut off my hand! You've never been more clever with a knife! Wait, he's a doctor! Maybe he can help me? This drunkard can't do anything! My treasure, my treasure, son! Livsi! He's not breathing, do something! You are a doctor! What's that drink? I can't when they don't trust me. Drink it yourself. Not all of them! Quick, ink, paper. I remembered the map. Mountain, trees, treasure! Absolutely everything! What's that? (Sighs) The emptiness... Emptiness? What emptiness, another hole? You remembered the map! Wait, don't shake him like that. The harder it gets, the harder it is to remember. Memory is like water. You shake it, it gets cloudy. And you're always twitching! Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. There is an offer. We need to immerse him in a magnetic dream. And then we'll find lost memories. A magnetic dream? Do you know how to do that too? It takes time, silence and trust. And rum. Okay. Okay. You give him his memory back, and I'll forget, that I swore on my head my mother that I'm gonna stab you. It's time. Silence. Trust. Rum. A lot of rum. It's the first time I've ever been on a voyage like this. And you are? Я? No. Monsieur de Vervais! Captain? Take your place! Jim. The water in the pelvis is soaked in magnetism. Look at the candlelight. Put your eyes down, Jim. What do you see? Water. Yes. Let's try to get back that's hidden deep in your memory. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5... Did you call me, Mrs. Baroness? Mr. Silver. I decided to change our course. Let's go to Jamaica. My husband has a plantation there. Madam Baroness, but we had a deal... Mr. Silver, I've asked you not to argue. I'll let you know. That's all. Okay. A treasure trove of pure adventure. But, uh... (sighs) Maybe you're hiding a trump card from me. I have nothing to hide, and you know it! If I trust you, Mr. Silver. You should be more open with me, too. Could share Share? What is it? Little secrets. Small treasures. I told you everything, I swear! And the map, Mr. Silver? You didn't show me the map! Mrs. Baroness, if I don't show her... not because I don't trust you, not even the other way around, it's for your safety, I swear! If anyone finds out that you know where the treasure is some may try to get you to open your mouth! I apologize for the expression. Mr. Silver. We will continue our journey. But you know, if you give the card I can give you access to other treasures... Oh, uh... My hand! Monsieur Silver, they're showing the cards first. And only then do they get a reward. To climb a high mountain. Okay, Jim. Keep going. To draw an imaginary line between the rocks. Livsie, Jim! I need a map! Today! Well, there you go. What? What? Livsie! You don't get a drop of it until you get his memory back! I'm dying of thirst! One sip! Listen, you stupid crow. Twenty sea wolves came with me to get the gold. If they don't get their share, they'll skin me. And they're gonna hang it on the mast next to Merry Roger. Did you understand? Right, Flint? How much longer is it gonna take? Captain Smolette is tired of dying. Brainstorm: The captain is a first-class sailor. Leading the ship for our own benefit. You know, I would've let Smolet to find the treasure, to load him onto the ship, and then I'd settle the score with him. Yeah. You're a masturbator, Silver. But there are plenty of flibusyers who are as capable of commanding as you are. It's a joke. I was kidding, Silver. Can I help you, Mr. Vicomte? Did you lose something? Is that you, my dear cook? I just thought I'd take a little walk. Are you okay? Yeah. You should go to bed. Did you give the order? What do you think you're doing? Listen, Vicomte, there's all the spin on board. The cooks are in charge And the Viscons don't ask questions. Get it? No? I don't know what you've lost here, but keep your mouth shut! Get it? And stop hanging around the baroness! You tire her out! Gotcha... Uh, uh... Baroness! My leg! All he can do is spin around around the baroness. That's all. Repeat what you just said. What did I say? Silver's not what he used to be. The wooden leg doesn't stop him to be the best of you. So he can't, I'll do it for him. That's touching, baby. But there are things that only Silver could do. Really? Like what? They're like that. So any sailor can dance like that. Even me. But not everyone is able to dance on the river over the water. Come on! Come on! Come on, come on, let's go! Dance, come on! Look, don't turn around! Well done! Come on, let's go, let's go! Dance! Be brave! What's going on here? No! Jim! Jim! Come back here! You hear that, Silver? I have to tell you, I'm not surprised. I've noticed the signs before. What signs, quack? Vertical splitting of the soul. This woman is playing a double game, it's like she's split up. And one half of them are completely unaware of the other's actions. The right hand is dazzlingly white and she has no idea. about the existence of a bloody and corrupt left, hidden in a bloody glove. The Lavana Sister. Angel and beast. Purity and viciousness. Okay. [Chuckles] Stop talking about it! He must have been hitting on her, so I got what I deserved. Captain Silver, I assure you... You were hanging with your thumbs up! And I saw the opposite! That's it. That's it. How do you like my crew, Captain? Oh, everybody's very hard-working, you can't say anything. I wish only no one was missing. This is bad. Have you been missing? We've already lost two sailors. One - this night, the other - last night. I ordered a search of the ship, but they're gone. They must have fallen overboard from the drink. This vessel needs an eye on it, Baroness. Tell me tomorrow about your of the calculations, captain. At your service, Mrs. Baroness. Jason, help! Mr. Hawkins, honey, come here, help the baroness, please. She wants the card, she'll get it. It's a copy. Call me Evangeline. Doctor, wake up, Silver's in danger! Oh, that's great. He's with Baroness, she's gonna stab him! Oh, let it go. It happens sometimes. Even with experienced pirates. Yes... You again... Good evening... Mr. Silver. The sea is calm today. Captain! Excuse me, Captain. Monsieur de Virpré, he's in trouble with his crew. Is he rebelling or something? Monsieur de Virpré? Let go of me. That's an order! Monsieur Silver, an order? Since when does Coke command the ship? We lost seven sailors. The guys are worried, there's no one to watch. Everybody knows this is the work of this gourmet with cat eyes. Yeah, that's right. That's not true, the Vicomte spends all night with me! Monsieur de Vervais? It's true, mrs. Stop this show, now! Bill! (Laughs) Leave it, come on, I'm telling you! Monsieur de Vervais! Tie this man up and into the hold! And this one, too! But, Captain, Sam and Silver saved my life! If I were you, Mr. de Vervais, I wouldn't brag about it. Follow your orders, Mr. de Vervais! Throw him in the hold. The ship's court will decide his fate. You shouldn't have killed Captain Flint. I'm the captain after him. Earth! Earth! To the left of the board! Earth! I became a gentleman of luck, I'm Vicomte Purple now! Shh! Quiet! Monsieur de Vervais, don't think that the new captain You'll be more forgiving, than the old one. The old crab was as good as shrimp. with the village's tentacles. What did you say? We don't want you, Silver. You speak for everyone again? Are you in charge now? No more in charge. But there's an extra one. Reminds me of the conditions of the fight. On my command, the duelants will take ten steps. Afterwards, they turn around and shoot. If they miss, they'll be fighting on knives. Who's gonna be the first to bleed the one who lost. One, two, three, four... Five... First blood! Long live Captain Silver! Bravo! Attention, everybody! See that island over there? This is not an island at all. It's a huge safe! And tomorrow we're going to go there and open it! And everyone will get their share, I give you my word. In the meantime, pour rum in. At dawn we dock at the island. Captain Silver, hip-hip! Hooray! Hooray! Hip-hip! Hooray! Hooray! Jim! Follow me. Where's the treasure, Jim? If I don't take them to the treasure, then I'll be divided into equal parts tomorrow, okay? Captain Silver, I'm like the chief ship's doctor, require to drink to your sudden advancement. You have one night to get his memory back. Then I'll hang you on the re, to calm the team down. And stop drinking! If it weren't for that damn rum, I would have made a lot of discoveries. I have a whole continent instead of a head. Undone, I can feel it. Silver's gone mad, he's a bloodthirsty beast. Our lives shouldn't depend on from this impostor. As long as he wants me. But then his desire will go out. And then... What should we do? Well, we're gonna do... I could be a Columbus of scientific thought. What's the matter with you? I'm not good with tobacco. О! Tobacco from the Antilles is the best tobacco! Where'd you get it from? This is the best tobacco from the Antilles! He's like church wine. I remembered. Map. I see: prison, Hawk. That's the same tobacco, I got sick. The memory's coming back. Give me more tobacco, doctor. We have to win. For this we need only one card. What map? This one. Treasure Island Map. Let's go find Silver. Explain to me why you're in such a hurry. But I have a map... As soon as you give him the card, he won't need you. And neither do I. Silver is my friend! Yeah, man. And that's why he's gonna shoot you before feeding the sharks. I can't wait till dawn. Nothing can be done, Silver. If you want to keep playing the game, put something serious on the line. Half my share, isn't that enough? Half of nothing equals nothing, Silver. Put your little protégé on the line. Jim's? What do you want him to do? He's a very nice little guy. And I am so lacking in tenderness. Let's play. Well, what? Jim is mine now. Got it? There's a gun in the captain's quarters. We need to get to the island, then we'll figure something out. Evangeline... My treasure... Let's go. Evangeline. Come down, quick! Evangeline! Evangeline! The gospel, come back here! And one. And one. And one. - Captain! Mrs. Baroness? - Shut up. Okay, Mrs. Baroness. Hold your fire. or you're dead! Why are you shooting at my treasure? The guns have to talk. You're drunk, you sneaky. Wake up, rats, wake up, damn it! The treasure's leaving! Boat on the water! Come on, hurry up! Help, devil, take you away! Two more, three more steps. And turn around. Turtle Stones. It's over there. To draw a line between the stone and the big tree. What tree? What tree, Jim? - Big. That's what he said. How accurate, however, is that? There are about 50 trees around us. We're not gonna dig 50 holes. Mrs. Baroness, I suggest we return to the ship. The six of us can get to Jamaica. Another stupidity, Captain, And one of the pits will be your last resting place. Keep an eye on him. - Yes. Come on, Jim. Well, what's quiet? Come to me. I always knew you weren't that stupid. as you seem to be. I know you want to pocket the treasure. That's your right, you were the keeper of the secret. and you have no reason to trust me, Jim Hawkins. But I can provide you with proof of your integrity. Mrs. Baroness, I swear, I said in... Jim! Jim! ... a dead man's chest, Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum! And the devil will bring you to the end yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum! It was a sailor. A sea uniform. That's a strange situation. That's not how they die. It's like it's stretching. - Looks like a compass shooter. A tree. Big tree. Well, what? That's terrible. Keep digging. Doctor? Would you excuse me? Thank you. Thank you. Captain, did you know that the island is inhabited? According to the maps, a small Spanish settlement. One of the few survivors in the battles of typhoons and malaria. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Fifteen people on the chest dead, yo, ho, ho, ho and... Silver, are you sure that Flint was dead? You think he'd tell the secret to Hawk if it hadn't died? Just an echo. It was Flint's voice. - Yes, that's right. Let's get out of here. - We're tearing our claws. I wasn't afraid of Flint while he was alive. So I won't be afraid of the dead. There are 700,000 pounds in the area. Somebody wants to change course, to give up the money? I was forced to, I didn't want to go with them. I was dragged by force. But you are here. We have to hurry up before they didn't find your treasure. My treasure was in front of their eyes. And they let him go. - Shall we go? Come on, let's go. Let's get going. - What's that? (Laughs) Albatross. А... Alba... Albatross. Albatross? The name of the schooner of this Flint canal. Look at this. Spanish doubloons. - Baroness, what have we found! Mrs. Baroness! Well, okay... Give me that. That's it, isn't it? Yes, that's all. Where's the treasure, Silver? This is it. - But that's not true! Of course it's not true, dumbasses! Then where is it? Ask the first person came here. Answer me. Silver, I give you my word of captain... - Come on, say it! Where, where is the treasure?! Kill him, kill him! Before you wave it around. with a gun, think about it. The treasure was buried here. We're very late, but the pit, full of corpses, he's not gonna get back. She's right, someone moved the treasure. It was Flint's ghost. Why not? Old Flint's ghost. Or Spanish vultures, who've been digging into the island. Who's not afraid to kick to these scoundrels' asses, take my side. What the hell, I'm going. And I will go. Get them out of the pit. And you're staying there. By burying me, you're burying science itself! Yeah, yeah, yeah. ...ignorant! There are people, who will continue my work! Well, hello... - A spoon for Mom... A spoon for daddy... Spoon for Aunt Sally... What's the matter, man? It was a snake! Where's that? (Chuckles) She bit me... Where to? For the ankle... Show me. Give me the doctor! Doctors? Get him out now! My treasure, poor thing... Save her, now! First you have to wash the wound! Don't strangle her, she needs air. It's a scientific fact. I saved your life by making up a snake, and you're gonna help me. We need to find the Spaniards, and if they've got the treasure, I'll get it. And they'll protect us from of these savages. Well? [Chuckles] Take her to the river Will you cure her? I can't promise. Does it hurt you? My men will take you away. I don't want them to touch me. Jason, Jim! The main thing is not to irritate her. Take me, take me with you. Take Ben Ghana. Don't let Ben Gun go! Ben Gang is dead! Flint killed him along with the others! Look, you drew this for me. Then, on the galley, with octopus ink. Ben Gun is not dead. Take me, I haven't eaten meat in 2,000 days. Take me with you The Spaniards have discovered your vessel. We gotta get out of here. No. The Spaniards dragged Flint's treasure. If you take us to the fortress, I'll pick you up. And you'll get your share. It's not them. What are you talking about? A treasure. Are you sure it wasn't them? If not the Spaniards, then who are they? Who is what? The treasure, Ben! If I show you where the treasure is, will you take it? Hurry up, hurry up, but be careful! Let's get out of here! Hurry, run, run, run... What's in there? How far is it? No, not far. There you go! (Laughs) Well, where? Coconuts? Everybody stop right now! Don't touch! Let the captain through! He's the first one to try. Beautiful. - Beautiful. But inedible. I demand to be received by your commanding officer. Friends, if we want to drag all that gold on the ship. we have to deal with the Spaniards first. Yes! Let's give the old man Ben the gun, he'll watch out prey and prisoners. And we'll attack them insidiously. Ben said they had about 20 slaves. Slaves, my friends! Are we free pirates let's just say that's not fair? Our solemn duty is to free them to give them back their faith in themselves. and give them a place on the team. that's so handicapped. Silver, you're as good a talker as your ass. You better tell me, you're doing this for the sake of of your whore's beautiful eyes? I assure you, my children, this is a disgusting talking room for me. Jim, help me, quick. Jim, this grid... You have to try, I... I'm sorry, I'm sorry, this will be my first and last time. I want to die in your arms! My angel, my demon! Jim Hawkins! Crabby... Crabs... Tasty crabs! Monsieur Ben, would you excuse me... I could lose my hand... I have to cautarize the wound. I mean, uh... Burn her down. Hot iron. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what Well, all right, you do it yourself. Burn it here. Mrs. Baroness. Did you kill that poor man, Jim Hawkins? Come on, come on, come on. Jim! Jim! О! Everybody's dead? Stanley! - Silver! Where are all the prisoners? The captain didn't move. He sleeps in a cave. My treasure. Eh. That's all there is. Where's the doctor? А! There he is! А! I ate those crabs for six years. Crabs, crabs and coconuts! I couldn't resist! How could you? How could you do that? How dare you take your life the man who cut off my leg? You know what I mean? I couldn't resist. I couldn't resist it! Come with me. Are you gonna hit me? Let's go! There must be some principles, isn't it? It's got to be. It's the doctor. You can't eat doctors. And a woman in my position is not appropriate to share 700,000 pounds with a cannibal. Come on, let's go. Would you like to take a break? What's the hurry? We need to find Smoleth and convince him to go to Jamaica. Take the rest. Let's go! Let's go! I'm not going down alone. "I, Philip Alexander Charles Henry William Augustus Smolet, I'm entrusting my soul to God. before you complete the act, who, under any other circumstances. a man of impeccable honesty and faith and has a sense of duty ...would have condemned you unconditionally. But how do you put your ship in the paws of rabid wolves I'm in my sober mind, and I'm in my good memory, I'm taking responsibility for the painful decision to set the ship on fire." Mr. Hawkins? What the hell is this? And the rest of it? Later on. I appoint you my assistant, Mr. Hawkins, and I express my gratitude to you for your bravery. do you happen to have any tobacco, Captain? I have something better, Mr. Hawkins. Much better. Hurry up, push it. First, we'll go to Jamaica with you, Mr. Hawkins. Yes, captain. That's where we'll fix the ship. we're gonna get a decent team and sell these stupid natives for a profit. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Let me go! Let me go! Row! Row! It's mine! Wait! Wait! - Don't touch it! No, no, it's mine! This is mine! Give it to me! Let me go! It's mine! - No! No, I'm not! It's all mine! Oh, you bastard! You are my treasure! How could you? With my new friends, Jim. will take over a little galleon. He'll let go of his beard, and he'll furrow of the sea. He'll go down in history as Blackbeard. And as for Baroness Evaengelina Madeleine Elizabeth Marie Geneveviève de Treloni and the pirate John Silver, they lived happily ever after. Only they didn't have kids.
