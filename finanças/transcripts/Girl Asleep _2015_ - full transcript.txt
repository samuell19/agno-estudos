Elliott. - At least I've got manners, Steven. Greta. Greta, rig ht? - Yeah. - That's a good name. What's it short for? Gretel? Margareta? Or just Greta? You know, as in short for Greta? Right, cool. I'm Elliott, Are you 14? - Yeah. - Snap, me too! 14 is good, huh? But I'm seriously looking forward to 15. I think 15's gonna turn a corner. It's gonna be so awesome. It's gonna herald the dawn of a new era, or something like that. Are you from around here? - No, we just moved. - Cool, right, yeah, awesome. 'Cause I am. You know, from around here. I know pretty much everything there is to know about around here. I know the population, elevation, average rainfall, climate, local industries. You know, that sort of thing. - Elliott, Elliott, Elliott! - Whatever, Steven! So, do you have any brothers? What about sisters? Do you have any sisters? - Yeah. - Oh, awesome. Sisters are the best, What about friends? Do you have any friends? 'Cause we can be friends, If you want. I'm pretty non-judgmental, you know. I'm usually happy to just go with the flow, actually. I find that's the best way to be friendly with people. I've got six guinea pigs. I count them as good friends, but their lifespan tends to hamper things a little. - Oh no, please! - So what do you reckon? Should we just hang out or something? We don't have to, I just I haven't got much to do, so. - Sure. "Really? - I guess. - Oh, awesome. Good choice' I like your thinking. We should get a donut. We should totally celebrate this with a donut. Okay. - Wait here' Just wait here! Hey. You're hanging out with us. We've taken quite a shine to you. I... - Ssh shh shh! We like you, new girl. Don't spoil it now by speaking. He's not invited. Greta! Greta, time! Greta! Coming! - Pencil, quick! - Oh, there's eyeliner in my bag. Se's home. - What do you call this, Genevieve? What the hell do you call this? 6:24. - Don't speak to your mother like that! Hey. Give her these, will ya? See ya, babes. I don't know why you think this behavior is acceptable. I raised you better than this. What, than to be a slut? Oi, watch it! You think you can just throw yourself on anyone? - Conrad! Hey. Have you, um, have you heard of that new movie, what's it called? Oh, um, ah, Constipation. - No. - Mm, it's 'cause it hasn't come out yet. I saw Diarrhea, though. - Oh, enough! - It got leaked early. - We're still eating! - Seven, definitely a seven. - Well, hey, I haven't got a seven in a while. I'll get it. - If it's for me, don't answer it. Oi, come on, lights out. Aye, aye' Comfy? Goodnight, sweetheart. - Come on. So anyway. I suggested she should use more tongue next time, if she wants that to work. Especially on Derek. "Really? 'You? - No, 'cause Dad came home, and we had to go downstairs and pretend nothing was happening. Didn't we, Amber? - That's full on, hey? - Not really. What do you normally do? What? - More tongue, or less? "Me? It depends, I guess. Really? On what? - Whether I feel like it OY DOI- - Hey, I can't remember. Are we going skating with the guys later this week? I think so. - Ooh, we should. You should come too, I could introduce you to Derek if you feel like it. Or not. - Awesome, that, that sounds awesome. I'm not feeling so great. Have you got your period? - Yeah, I've just, I've gotta find a toilet. - What about that one? Hey, Elliott! Hey. - I'm sorry about before. They totally put me on the spot. - That's cool, I get it. - If you're still interested, did you want to hang out? - Oh, crap! I hate those dogs. That's where the triplets live. They always do that. - So did you wanna hang out? - Are you kidding? Of course I wanna hang out. - I think my place is down this way. - That's so funny. You don't even know where you live! - Greta? Is that you? - Mum, this is Elliott. Elliott, this is Mum. Hello there, Elliott. Hello, Mrs. Driscoll. I love your house. It's gorgeous. - Well thank you, Elliott. That's, that's lovely of you to say. - Holy crap balls! Is that you? You're so cute! Oh. - Come on. - Can I get you kids anything? - Whoa! You've got plastic horses? - Yeah. - I can't believe it. I love plastic horses. Really? - They're like almost the best thing in the world. I've got plastic pigs at home. I collect plastic pigs. Really? Did you make these? - Yeah. - How do you do that? Those folds are so freaking little. - See these? They're from my penpal in Finland. - Finland? Oh my God, that is so freaking exotic. - I know. We've been writing to each other for ages. Her name's Greta too. We love calling each other Greta. - Oh, hello Greta! - Oh yes, hi Greta. - How are you today, Greta? - I'll read you one. "Dearest Greta, "how are you in the land of sunshine, Greta? "Better, Greta, than freezing in the winter of Helsinki. "I wish I was there, Greta." - Oh my God, she is so awesome. - I told you. - Keep going. - Oh. "I've sent you a copy of my favorite picture. "It's a Huldra, "a wild warrior girl who lives amongst the trees in Finland "and can never be tamed, "If you meet one walking in the woods, you must be careful, "for if you are mean to her, "she will punish you with her leather fist of fury." - Whoa, hot. - Can I show you one more thing? - Yeah! - My mum gave it to me on my fifth birthday. It was hers when she was little. Ah, be careful. It's really old. You don't want to get a splinter. I used to imagine that it was from a faraway realm. Cool. - A realm where anything could happen. Filled with mystical creatures and stuffed with untold treasures. - Whoa, sounds like the Vatican. - And that the magic inside this tune kept the entire realm safe from the dangers that lurked beyond its borders, hidden in the shadows. It's my most favorite thing in the world. That was a longtime ago. I was just a kid back then. - Lucky you're not a kid anymore, hey? No, seriously, your room is so awesome. It's easy with you, Greta. Who needs those other idiots in our year? I'm glad you're my friend. - Yeah, me too, Elliott. Me too. - You kids all right in here? - We're doing great, thanks, Mrs. Driscoll. - Wonderful, that's just wonderful. You should stay for tea, Elliott. I'm making Chinese. "Really? I love Chinese, - What? This is an excellent beef and black bean sauce, Mrs. Driscoll. What cut did you use? - Um, chuck, I think. Chuck, delicious. - How do you like your school, Elliott? - It's not too bad when you get the hang of it. - That's wonderful, How do you think Greta will go? - Mum. - She'll blitz it, no question. - Greta's had her fair share of problems at school before, Elliott. That's why we're asking. "Really? With like older kids? - Ones her own age, too. - Um, can we just eat and not talk, please? And how old are you, Elliott? - I'm 14. I'll be 15 in December. I can't wait. - Greta's turning 15 soon. - Hey, you should have like an awesome party or something. That'd be so awesome, - No, it wouldn't. - Conrad? Can you help me with the pudding for a second? - Good shot' You should play hockey. She needs encouraging. She needs to come out of her shell. Janet, no! Oh, come on. We need to strike while the iron's hot. 'No! No, I don't think ifs a good idea. - She's ready. She just needs a bit of a nudge, that's all. - Who needs a nudge? What are you talking about? - Fudge. Just need some fudge, but we don't have any. Do we, Conrad? - No. No fudge here. - Hey, the bell has gone, move! - Sorry, Miss Shitstick. - Excuse me? What did you say? - Shiswick, I said, sorry Miss Shiswick. Jesus! - Come on, Gen, I'm gonna get busted if I'm late. - No, we wouldn't want her to get busted now, would we babes? - No, she's definitely not ready for that. - Pink slip, office, now. - Awesome, thanks. - Don't worry, the day's about to get shittier anyway. - Ah, hello, yes! With bells on, This is gonna be so awesome. I'm gonna wear a suit! Oh God! Oh God! - It's just a little celebratory get together, that's all. - But I don't want a party. - Oh, just be grateful, will you? I never got offered anything when I was your age. All I got was, "Oh, which Pizza Hut do you wanna go to?" - And what's wrong with Pizza Hut? The have puzzles on the place mats. That's very clever. - What's all the hubbub in here? Oh, Jesus, put some clothes on! - I told you I didn't want a party. - We just want to meet more of your friends, that's all. Show you off a little. You're becoming a beautiful young woman, but you always hide your light under a bushel. - What? - I'll get you a new dress, and we'll get your hair and makeup done. We can all do it! - She doesn't need too much gussying up though, does she? Not my little girl. - Mum, please don't do this. - It's important. I just want you to come out of your shell a little more. It'll be good for you. But... - No buts' It's happening, all right? End of story. Dad, she's not even listening to me. - I think you're overreacting a little bit, pumpkin. I'm not overreacting! - You are, - Do you wanna destroy my life? I don't want a party! - Your mum's already gone to a lot of trouble. - Neither of you are listening! Turn it down a bit, please. 'No! Get this through your thick skulls! I don't want a party! - Greta! - No fucking party, all right? - You okay? - No. - What's going on? Come on. I hate seeing you like this, pumpkin. I miss my happy little girl. You remember her? Hmm; Where'd she go? She's still here. - Look, in the end it's up to you, but it'd mean the world to your mother. She's only trying to help. Mmm. Hmm; Just think about it, I'm sure you'll feel better about it later. If you push her. 'Stop it! - Then she'll treat you - I said - The same way Gen does. - Stop it! She's not ready for this. She doesn't want a birthday. - Oh, yes, yes, and you know what she want's,. Do you? Don't touch me like that! - Oh, Jesus Christ. - You know I hate it. Well, am I that repulsive, am I? - I can't talk to you. Well, if I disgust you that much. I am not talking to you. I am not. - Hello? Don't you dare! What else can I do? How dare you say that to me? Jesus. You can be so cold sometimes. Oh, this again! I'm just trying to tell you. I don't want to hear anymore. Oh, great. I've had it, I've had enough. You're just gonna freeze me out then? - I'm sorry about before. I wasn't doing it to be mean. - I know. And you're right. I want the party. You won't regret this, darling. You won't regret this one little bit. - Greta, Greta, get out here! What do you think? Hey? Huh? Huh? - Genevieve, give me a hand with these decorations, Wi“ you? They're not gonna hang themselves now, are they? - I'm making a playlist, Janet. - Oh, none of that Benwit Tremit rubbish, please. - It's Benoit Tremet. - It's way too sexualized for my liking, thank you very much. - What's wrong with a bit of sexy? Where do you want me to put this, Janet? - Oh, yeah, um, yeah, just put that outside, Adam, thank you. - Sweet. - Conrad! Did you get the ice? - Sorry? What was that? Ice! - Yeah. Ice. What are you doing? Are you okay? - I should never have agreed to this. - Well, you remember my 15th. Be careful. Weird shit can happen. Case in point. Come on. - Oh, stop it. - You do not look your age, Janet. - Oh! - Seriously, you two could be sisters. Oh! Oh. Give me that. Ah. - Oh, hey, babes. You're not flirting with my mum, are you? - Totally. All the ladies in your family are hot. - I have a husband, you know. - I think I just threw up a little in my mouth. - Can we keep moving, please? Bloody hell! - What have ya done? - Who put the mousse on top of the ham? - It wasn't set yet! Why were you moving it? - All I did was open the bloody fridge! It's not my bloody fault! - I don't have time for this! - Ah! - Tada! - Oh, Mum, no, please, no. I don't want to, Mm-mm. - So. What do you do? - I'm in carpet. - Yeah, right. Carpet. Like shag pile? - That's one of our lines, - I hope you're both sitting down. Ready? What? I look horrible, don't I? - Whoa' - You look beautiful, darling. You're so grown up. - You're beautiful. - Whoa' You... - Don't say another word, or I will seriously punch you in the frigging balls. None of this was my idea. They've painted me up like a stupid doll. I don't even like wearing dresses. You can speak you know? - But you said you were gonna punch me in the balls. - You don't have to be so literal, Elliott. - Good, 'cause I value my texticles. I just feel set upon, you know? - Yeah, sure. - I told them I didn't want a party. I didn't want people I hardly knew here. I mean, they'll take one look at me and think I'm a complete deadshit moron. - Probably. Hey. What do you think of my suit? - It's nice. I'd much rather wear that than this. Seriously? Yeah, I mean you might even get lucky tonight. - With who? I hear Denise Mackel might be coming. She's got her eye on you, you know? - Which one? Denise Mackel's got crazy eyes. - Greta? Oh my Godfather, people are arriving! Somebody get that! - Oh God. Elliott! Get in here and help me with these vol-au-vents. - Greta, you can do this. I know you can.

You guys came, I, I didn't think you would. - To be completely honest we were a little surprised when we received our invitation. Weren't we?

You know, as friends. - Why would you think that? - We offered you an olive branch of friendship and when you decided you didn't want it, we were a little, how would you put it, Amber? Miffed. - Miffed? - Miffed, dismayed, perturbed. The last one's an adjective. Really? - You've been totally avoiding us. It's kind of upsetting, you know? - I, I'm so sorry.

You thought you'd just come in here, and I'd throw myself at your feet, is that it? - Jeez, Greta, that's a bit harsh. I'm just saying. - Then tell me I'm being a bitch. Go on. That's what you really wanna say, isn't it? - Greta. - Everyone says you're a homo, anyway. Why would I be interested in someone like you? Go on, tell me I'm being a frigid bitch.

Confusing and you're pretty much hating it. You're not alone, all right? And this? This never existed. - Thanks, Gen. - Come on. You should go downstairs, otherwise Adam might crack onto Mum again. - That was pretty. - About before. Sorry. You go first. Okay. You had no right to call me a homo before.

I think about them way too much. Like six or seven times a day, I think about girls, and I, well, wait. - I get the point. - Right.
