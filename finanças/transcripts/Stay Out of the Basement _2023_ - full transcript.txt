Alright. Here we go. If anything happens, that $30 goes to my mom's new car. Realistically, if anything happens- you guys get in trouble for encouraging me to do this in the first place. It's not my fault I need the money and you guys took advantage of that. Just saying. Sorry. I - I didn't think to try to show her. I guess, um, trying to get smooth video when you're about to die- is not my first instinct. I don't feel well. That was not worth $30. But I'll take it. Hi, uh, Elizabeth? I'm Mackenzie. Hi, uh. Where did your parents park? Oh, um, it's just me. I rode my bike here. Oh, thank you. Sure. I figured after a long ride you might be thirsty. I have a thermos on my bike I just didn't want to bring it up to the door. Why? Feels unprofessional. Unprofessional? Could you imagine a grownup just waltzing into a job interview- with a big, obnoxious pink thermos? Yeah, I guess - probably not. Exactly. So, you take this that seriously? Of course I do. You - any guardian or parent- You're entrusting me with the safety of, not only your house, but your most precious possession. So I better take it seriously. That's uh... That's a refreshing point of view. I talked to your references, uh. Mrs. Phillips, Mrs. Long, Mr. Breck. They all said you were great. And they mentioned your fine attention to detail. I thought they might. Can I ask why you like babysitting? I've always been good with kids. Younger kids. I have a little brother and sister - twins. And I've always helped out with them. So, I'm good with kids and I like making money. So babysitting is like - perfect. I see. Uh - you're sure your parents don't want to meet me? They're okay with you spending the night over here? Yep. They know where I am and they trust me. Yeah, uh... Let me... ...give you a tour of the house and... We'll see you on Friday. Alright. Thanks, Elizabeth. Call me Liz. That's the basement. It's off limits so don't let Peyton tell you otherwise. Sure, no problem. You're not going to ask why it's off limits? It's none of my business but - if you're offering... It's under construction and it's just uh - not safe. Not even the stairs. Alright, we'll stay away. >>Good. Let me show you the last bedroom. That's where you can sleep if you->>I don't mind the couch. It looks comfy. Well, let me show you anyway. Just so you have your options. That's my Dad. One moment. Sure. >>Hey Dad. Yeah. Uh-huh. Whoa. You okay? >>Yeah. Yeah, uh. The door just... opened. It's usually locked. But there's a window open down there. So... it'll blow open if it's ajar even a little. Okay. Well, uh. Let's. Let's see the last room. Did you really just do that? I'm getting bored back here, hurry it up. Well, that's not going to help, genius. Well, it entertained me. You almost jumped out of your chair and I got it on camera. Hey. That could've fallen on the floor, are you crazy? Ow. I almost broke my neck. That wasn't funny. I hope you were still recording. I was. >>You're so dead when I get up. Did you finish that report yet? Almost. Get it done. And keep it down in here, it's a school night. Birthday exceptions don't mean you can horse around all night. Okay, sorry. Sorry Mr. Vincent, we'll be quieter. Alright. You can't horse around all night. Stop it. Before your Dad yells at me again. Don't start nothin', won't be nothin'. Don't ever say that again. Cammy. Cammy, wake up. What are you doing? The door opened by itself. Your Dad probably opened it. Just close it. Go to bed. Are you girls alright? Hey, what's up? I'm just getting ready for practice. Are you still babysitting? Duh. Why wouldn't I be? Um, because their house is obviously haunted. And whatever's there followed you home and scared the hell out of us. How do you know it came from there and not the cornfield? What do you mean? The cornfield I went into. Which I told you not to do. For the record. >>Whatever. Behind it, there's woods. A stream. And on the other side another cornfield. The one on Valley Boulevard. Right. They say there's a woman in white haunting there. She resembles a girl who went missing in the 80's. They say she was sacrificed to some demon. Yeah. And it takes on her form and tricks people into sacrificing to it. Yeah. Heather Morris committed suicide there. And another guy got stabbed. Which is why they closed the road. So people wouldn't go in. Because of the deaths not because they believe it was really haunted. I don't know. But the cornfield that I went to was really close. Like, not even two miles away. If something was going on there, then- What? You think it followed you or something? I'm not sure but whatever happened last night was really creepy. Well if it makes you feel any better... Any of the stories I've heard have all been based on Valley Boulevard. Sounds dumb, but... Hopefully if there's something there, it's trapped there. You scared? >>No, just trying to figure everything out. Anyway, I better go. I want to start biking there before it gets dark. >>Good idea. If I chip in a dollar, could you help me with this? You don't have to pay me to help you with your homework. That's kinda part of the job. I don't really want your help. I just want you to do the rest. You have four problems left. Five. If you don't just do it for me. You'll need more than a dollar. Fine. Just don't fall asleep tonight. Why not? Cuz, I'll wake up and trash the house so you lose your tip. It's going to be one of those nights, isn't it? You're doing fine. Liz, you okay? Liz? Yes? You okay? Yeah. Uh, I - I put the Grub Hub order in. Food should be dropped off at 7. Peyton's bedtime is 8:30. It's the weekend. 9:30. 10 at the latest. >>Yes ma'am. Come to the door with me? Nine. Ten. Eleven. Twelve. Um, don't open the door for the delivery. There won't be a car in the driveway, so if they just see you here, then - I don't want anything to happen. You never know. I'll text you when I get a notification that the food's here. And I'll send you a picture of what the driver looks like. So you know who it's supposed to be. Sure. No problem. It's contact-less delivery but... Sometimes they still knock. I don't know why. Habit, maybe? Or they're just stupid. >>Both? Oh, and... one more thing. What is it? We keep the windows open in the basement at night. And it's kind of an old house so sometimes there's noise. I should've mentioned that earlier. If you scare easily tell me now. I don't. The house isn't haunted or anything, is it? Peyton thinks it is. I'll be okay. And... I'll watch what I say around her so I don't scare her. Thank you. And there's nothing here that would hurt her or - any of us. It just... can be unsettling. I've dealt with worse than spooky noises. I got this. Don't worry about it. Alright. Thank you, Mackenzie. I- I hope you come back. I have a good feeling about you. Um. You too. Goodnight. See you in the morning. >>Goodnight. Uh, goodnight Mackenzie. Feel free to call or text me if you need anything. Though, I will be working so can't say I'll answer right away. No problem. Have a great night. You know this house is haunted, right? Like, haunted AF. What? Do you even know what that means? Language. Slow down on those chips. Save some room for dinner. I have plenty of room. I'm starving. You worked up an appetite flunking this test, huh? I'm just kidding. You got everything right. That was mean. Not as mean as you threatening my tip. Good work, though. So, we've got about an hour before dinner. What do you want to do? I don't know. That's your job, Ms. Babysitter. I don't know what you like. What do you have around here? TV. It's too early for TV. Don't be a boob. A boob? My grandpa calls TV the 'boob tube'. Cause it turns you into a mindless boob when you watch it all day. Like Tik Tok? Not as bad. But that's correct. Well, what do you do when you have friends over? I don't have any friends. What? We just moved back here a month ago. We moved to Delaware for a while. Then came back here. I didn't have any friends there, either. Everyone thinks I'm weird just like my mom is. Your mom's sweet. Come on, she's weird. You don't have to pretend she's not. Your mom's got anxiety or something, okay? That's not weird. Anyone who says it is, is just dumb and mean. Well, everyone is dumb and mean. That's why I don't have any friends. You have one now. You're getting paid to be here. Right. So I could let you sit in front of the TV all night and turn into a boob. But I'm not going to let that happen. We're going to have fun. Right now. Like, right this very second. So put down those chips, turn that frown upside down. And we're going to have some fun. ♪ bouncy, energetic music ♪ Chocolate Chip. Challenge. What? Yeah! Challenge? Uno. No. Done. Uno! Done. Done. Done. Done. Done. ♪ bouncy, energetic music ♪ ♪ bouncy, energetic music ♪ ♪ bouncy, energetic music ♪ What is wrong with you? You can't even fit all that in your mouth. >>After all those fries and that giant burger, too? That was two hours ago. I know, and you'll probably ask me for dessert before bed, too. Well, of course. Can you be my babysitter from now on? If your mom's a good tipper. Not only will I be your babysitter. But I'll ask your mom if I can come over sometimes and we can hang out. Can I ask you a question? M-hm. >>Why did you guys move? You promise you'll come back if I tell you? Of course. I think our old house was haunted. I don't know by what. I never saw anything. But I know my mom did. She was scared of something. She started sleeping in my room. And became really protective. How did this all start? When we came home late from her ex-boyfriend's house. We were driving somewhere in the woods. On Hurley Pond Road. I remember seeing a sign when we left. I was asleep in the backseat, and... Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom! Mom?! Hey. Peyton! Peyton, what are you doing out here? Where did you go? I woke up in the car and you were gone. Why didn't you wake me up? I - I-I'm sorry, I - I Peyton, I shouldn't have done that. Where were you, Mom? I... I thought I saw someone who needed help. I locked you in the car to keep you safe. I went to look for her, but... Who - who did you see? I - it was no one. Or at least no one who needed help. I - it doesn't matter. I shouldn't have done that and I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Do you forgive me? If you get me out of these woods I will. Deal. She was different after that. She was scared of something. And even when she wasn't scared... She was always... Somewhere else. Even when she was home. That doesn't make sense, does it? I know what you mean. The house felt different after that. It was always cold. And I would hear things. I'd have night terrors. I'd wake up in other rooms. Outside once. I think that's why we moved. Although she said it was work. But whatever it was just followed us there. And followed us back here. Do you still have the picture that you took? Yeah. She deleted it from her phone. But I sent it to my email and printed it out in school. It's under my mattress. You sure you're going to come back? You're scared. I can tell. How old are you? Seven. I'm fourteen. If you can go through all of that and you're okay, I'll be fine. I think I saw some brownie mix in the cabinet. You already complained I was eating too much. And you are but we need a distraction, so - brownies. Brownies! Ready? Yep. Let's go. I know, Peyton. I will come get you tomorrow. I just have to deal with something first. You're having fun at your Grandma and Grandpa's aren't you? I know. I will come. First thing in the morning. Yes. Yes. I'll be... I'll be fine. Okay? Yeah. Love you. Liz. Hey are you okay? I called for you before I came in. The door was still open. I... I didn't hear you. I'm - I'm sorry. It's okay, I'm sorry I scared you. I just - I heard you moved away. And I didn't see you for three weeks. Then I saw your car and I - I just... We moved back. The other place didn't work out. It's a better deal here. Sorry, I didn't tell you. It was kind of abrupt. Yeah. Whatever, it's fine. I was just worried. Hope I didn't get you in trouble with Rick. The diner's fine. They filled your shift pretty fast. But if you need to go back, I'm sure he'd talk to you about it. Honestly, we were all just worried. Are you okay? Can I get you some coffee? That's the least you could do. You just tried to kill me, so... Maybe you should sit down. I can't. I... I have too much energy. I, I... I can't stop moving, otherwise... Otherwise, what? Why won't you look out the window? Liz, sit down right now. I can't Haley. Liz. Sit. The coffee's almost ready. I'll take care of that. The way you're shaking you'll spill it all over the place, anyway. Come on. I must have fallen asleep at the wheel. I don't know, I... I closed my eyes for a second. And... I felt a bump. And I opened my eyes. I... hit the brakes... And there was this woman. Running into the woods. I left Peyton asleep in the car. I know I shouldn't have, but... I got out to check on her, and... I couldn't find her but there was... This weird shrine and even though I couldn't find her- ... I knew I wasn't alone out there. Something was like... Waiting for me. I could feel it. I feel it... I feel it even now. Almost every time I look out a window, I- There's something out there, or... ...in the room with me. You really think some entity followed you home? How else would you explain all this? Our minds work in mysterious ways. And you've been through a lot in your life. You've had to fight to protect Peyton from very real threats. And so - I think whatever happened exacerbated that. And is playing on it in a surreal way. Through... nightmares. And maybe... hallucinations. What about Peyton's night terrors? How does my anxiety explain her getting up in the middle of the night. And me having to find her out in the f- Out in the woods behind our home. In the closet or >>She can sense what you're going through. Kids pick up on a lot more than you think. And just like with her Dad's... ...drinking problems. It can affect her subconsciously. And come out in all sorts of behaviors. I think you ought to talk to someone. Maybe take something that... ...can help you. I can get you into my doctor's office for a free consult. What else can you do? Running away obviously didn't help. I think I have to... Confront her. Or. It. Find out what it wants. And you think it wants Peyton. >>I know it does. But... There has to be something else I can do. Yeah, and I just gave you the best option. Do you want to get professional help or do you want to go into the woods to... ...confront some entity? I want to protect Peyton. I think evil spirits can be real. But if they are, then God's real. I know your mom doesn't believe in that, but... I don't think she does. But I do. Well, good. And if He's real He's more powerful than any spirit. No matter how scary they are. Sometimes, when I get scared, like, of something like a spirit. Or like the time my house got robbed when I was 10, I'd read this. "He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High, "Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. "I will say of the Lord, 'He is my refuge and my fortress. "'My God, in Him I will trust.' "Surely He shall deliver you from the snare," the trap, "of the fowler." So, like a bird trapper. Why would a bird trapper be after me? Well, it's used more... like... It's just an example. I get it. Continue. >>"And from the perilous pestilence." So, like a disease. >>Like Coronavirus? Yep. "He shall cover you with His feathers and under His wings you shall take refuge. "His truth shall be your shield and buckler. "You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, nor of the arrow that flies by day. "Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness. "Nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday. "A thousand may fall at your side and 10,000 at your right hand. "But it shall not come near you. Only with your eyes shall you look, "And see the reward of the wicked. "Because you have made the Lord, who is my refuge, even the Most High- "Your dwelling place. No evil shall befall you. "Nor shall any plague come near your dwelling. "For He shall give His angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways." I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I... I didn't mean to scare you. Do - do you have a phone? Is this - Is this your home? Do you... do you even know where we are? Will you say something? I have to go. She's - she's coming back. I'll call for help. Come on, you got to at least untie me. She's coming back. Hide. Listen. Listen. I had two more stops left after my last. People are going to be looking for me. Did you hear me?! People are going to be looking for me! You okay? Yeah. I... I was reading to her- -and I fell asleep. Sorry I didn't mean to sleep in here. I'm surprised she didn't ask you to. She did. Um, I told her I would stay till she fell asleep. You guys got along that well, huh? Yeah. She's... she's special. She is. You decide where you want to sleep? Can I sleep in here? On the floor. On the floor? You've got a bed and a couch. Yeah, I know. But... Whatever you want. Thank you. Let me get you some extra blankets and a pillow. Rise and shine! Good morning, Peyton. Let's go get breakfast. Come in. Hey. Did you hear the news? What news? You may have not been dreaming last week after all. No way. 'Aedan Cooley's Honda CRV was discovered by a jogger this morning. 'Parked down a path leading to the Wheaton River.' But they didn't find him? No. It says they're waiting on forensics but there's no immediate signs of foul play. He made the rest of his deliveries that night. Maybe she followed him. You said he didn't make it back till almost midnight, right? But if she was going to kill him there, why would she? To cover her tracks, obviously. She might've made those last two deliveries. It just doesn't make sense, Cammy. This is all weird I know, but it's... ...less weird to think of it like it was a dream. But if it wasn't Peyton could be in danger. And her mom. Maybe you should talk to Liz. I was thinking of going over there, anyways. So, maybe. Just make sure you babysit here from now on. What are you working on? The book that Peyton took a picture of. It was in Hindi. I was able to translate some of it. It's about Anna Kuari. 'A Hindu goddess that requires human sacrifice to bless the harvest of her worshipers.' If there was a demon in that cornfield she might have been it. What road did Peyton say that happened on? Um. Hurley Pond. What do you think Liz saw out there? That's, um. That's a disturbing dream. Uh... Peyton told me a little bit about what you guys went through. With moving or... Whatever happened on the road before you moved. The creepy things going on around the house. I told her not to bring that up. I asked and she was scared. I'm sorry, but I only bring it up... So I can make sure that you're not in any danger. Either of you. Hm. Do you think something or someone, maybe, followed you home? I think that Peyton had a terrifying experience that night- that I made a very poor parenting decision- -to leave her alone in the car. I think that night has had some lasting repercussions. Maybe for both of us. And you think that my dream was just a... crazy... dream? With everything that Peyton told you- and how creaky and creepy this house is. Absolutely. Trust me. I'd do anything to protect Peyton. If I thought there was something going on I'd handle it. You've been in the basement? Every day. I put a padlock on the door outside. The day after you were here. Been meaning to do that for a while. Want to look for yourself? Oh, no. That's not necessary. You sure? Mackenzie! I missed you! I missed you, too. I told you it wasn't all about the money, didn't I? I didn't believe you. I didn't think you'd ever come back. Hey, we're friends. I'm not going anywhere. Want to help me with some homework? Peyton. Don't bother her with your work. I don't mind. Please? Can she? She just came here to talk. I don't know how long she has- -until her parents expect her back. It's up to her. I'm good. I've got time. I'll make something for lunch, then. Sounds great. Where are you? Where are you?! I'm tired of it. You chased us out of our home. You followed us to Delaware and back. I don't remember the last time I slept through the night. I don't remember the last time my little girl slept through the night. Without waking up screaming. Or worse. And it's because of you. So what do you want? Why are you doing this to us? Is it because I got out of my car that night? Because I tried to help. I thought I was helping someone. I didn't know what you were. But I do now. And this is ending tonight! You're not going to keep putting Peyton through this. She's gone through enough in life - she does not need it! So, whatever you want - Keep her out of it! You want blood? Take it from me. Do you hear me? Take it from me! I heard you screaming from the road. I almost called the police. Anyone else would have. You need help. For your sake, for Peyton's. But I don't want to make that choice for you. Unless I have to. I know it's not my business but whatever made you come out here? And - after what happened in the bathroom I'm worried you're a danger to yourself. And... and others. Peyton. Liz. Let me help you. Okay. Hey, Mac? Hm? Did you hear me? No, I'm sorry. What did you say? I've been reading the psalm- Every night since you read it to me. I haven't had any nightmares since then. That's a start. Captions by: Shady dawn pictures
