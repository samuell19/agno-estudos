[thunder rumbling] [waves crashing] [brakes screeching] [woman talking indistinctly over police radio] [thunder rumbles] He's alive. Come on. Let's get him back on the beach. [radio chatter continues] He's breathing. [coughing] [officer] Okay. Turn him around. Easy now. I'll cover him up. -Get another blanket. -[coughing] [officer] Fine. -[speaks indistinctly] -I'll radio the station. -[man] Man over... -[officer] What did he say? -He fell overboard. -[officer 2] He fell overboard. -What's your name? -[coughing] This is Landis. Come in. -[coughs, speaks indistinctly] -Who fell overboard? Who are you, son? We couldn't find him in the storm. Put me through to Detective Stone. Who fell overboard? What was his name? Ashby. [thunder rumbling] Please, Christina! Ashby? You don't think he means one of Ashby brothers, do you? Ashby... [coughs] Please! [screaming] Christina! Cristina. [coughs] [wind blowing] [thunder rumbles] [officer] Better get him down to the station and have a doctor check him out. Lieutenant Stone's not there. There's some emergency at the hospital. Take him. Let's go. Okay? Okay, let's get him to the police station. Come on, we're gonna get soaked. Hurry up. [Stone] So the only other people on board were Ted Ashby and this captain named Lynch. And you say the yacht was about a half mile off shore. [camera clicks] -No. Please, stop. -That'll be all, miss. Thank you for your statement. I know how difficult this can be. You get some rest now, and we'll notify the next of kin. Okay. We'll put your personal belongings in here. They'll be safe. [ominous music playing] Oh, it is you, all right! See, I read the society page all the time. I'm sorry, but what happens now? -Is the doctor coming to see me? -Oh. Um... I'm just gonna take a report. The doctor should be back in a few minutes. He had to run down to the police station. -I'm just so cold. -Oh. Um... -here's a blanket. -Thank you. [nurse] I must say you're a very strong woman to have survived such an ordeal. Okay. We'll let's just take this report quickly. [Stone] The doctor says you're gonna be just fine. [Jack] Yeah? Lieutenant, uh... can I get a cigarette from you? You got enough bad habits, Jack. [Jack] What are you talking about? You know what I think the two most overrated things in the whole wide world are? White folks' barbecue and one-night stands away from home. Oh, do we have to listen to this again? See, they're just mad at me 'cause I won't give them my secret recipe for love or barbecue. And I ain't giving it to you either. But how about you tell us about your recipe, Jack? My recipe? I... I don't know what you're talking about. -Is that right? -Yeah. I... Well, maybe we can help refresh that failing memory of yours. [Stone] Now, how long were you with the Ashby brothers, Jack? [suspenseful music playing] I'm sorry. I didn't know you were here. [chuckles] It's my brother. Wanna join us? For old times' sake. Your guests are waiting. It's rude to be late, you know. Well, fuck 'em. You entertain them. I'm busy, or haven't you noticed? If it's all the same to you, I won't be staying. All work and no play makes Jonathan a dull boy. But a very rich boy, isn't that right, John? Isn't it? [ominous music playing] [clears throat] -Boozing again, bro? -Don't disappoint us. -It's good to have you on board. -Listen, Ted, I have to be going now. I'll catch up with you on the island. After all, two's a company, three's a crowd. I'll take the morning flight. Maybe you'll surprise me and be on time for a change. Well, look who's here. Let me introduce my new captain, Jack Lynch. I had to fire the old one for insubordination. You know how I like people who do what they're told. Stop playing games. -[Ted] Ooh. Temper. Temper. -[Jonathan] Grow up, Teddy. What are you waiting for? Party's on deck. [suspenseful music playing] [Stone] Now, why don't you tell me what happened on that yacht last night? Uh, there was-- well, there was a storm and-- Yeah, we know all that. What else is going on out there? We already have confirmation that the rest of the crew was on shore, leaving only you on board. Now, our friends in the Coast Guard we're lucky enough to find your employer's yacht drifting out to sea. They sent us these pictures. Now, I have a sworn statement giving me a very interesting version of what happened on that boat. -Statement by who? -[Stone] A young lady. She says you shot her boyfriend, threw his body overboard, then went down to her cabin and raped her. [chuckles] Well, I... [scoffs] I didn't shoot anybody and I sure as hell didn't rape Christina. I didn't mention the young lady's name. But I do have a nurse's report that says she had sexual intercourse within the last 12 hours. And according to your statement, Mr. Ashby went overboard the night before. Now, who she have sex with, Jack, if it weren't with you? There wasn't anybody else on board, was there? Listen, I can't think straight right now. [Stone] In fact, you forgot to tell the boys here that Ms. Ford was on board at all. Well, she was on board. I-I... I'm a little confused right now. She, uh-- Okay. I didn't say she was on board but she was on board. She was there. What are you guys getting at? Hey, you see what I mean, Jack? It's like my barbecue mix. It's one big mystery. It took the whole night and most of the next day to get back to port, then we ran the reef. Now, you see my problem, Jack? Unless you're telling me that while you were struggling to bring the boat back to port, she jumped back in the water, swam out there to give him one last goodbye piece of ass, then swim back to the yacht to be with the man she says kill him... [man] I'd say that's one hell of a nice girl. [Stone] You got that right. You know I met the father, the seedy Mr. Ashby, one time? [man] I'm sure you wouldn't remember, but I actually met you and your brother, Ted, during the island carnival last year. I was supposed to meet my brother on his yacht. We were flying out tomorrow. How could something like this have happened? I'm very sorry, Mr. Ashby. Who's the prosecutor out here? That would be Mr. Wendell Huston. -Is he any good? -Well, I'd say this case is so cut and dry I could handle it myself. Well, I applaud your enthusiasm, but I intend on seeing that my family's best interests are served, you see? Oh, why, of course. Thank you. Sorry to tell you, Jack. I'm afraid I'm putting you under arrest for suspicion of murder and rape. You're gonna have to get a lawyer. I don't think so. [chuckles] [suspenseful music playing] Let's see what we got here. A good sailor washes up on shore, beautiful socialite say she been beaten and raped by him, and a Coast Guard finds a yacht minus one multi-millionaire. Hope you don't think this is a big game we're playing here. This lady's laying some serious charges on you, Jack. So, uh, what about the gun? What'd you do with that? Just toss it overboard? Listen, I don't give a shit if you believe me or not, but what happened was a big swell hit the side of the boat, the starboard side. I went to the wheel to see what was wrong, She yelled and said that he fell overboard. It was an accident, all right? That's what fucking happened. Was that before or after you raped her? I didn't rape her. But there was no one else on board, right? [scoffs] [sarcastically] Yeah, that's right... Sorry, Jack. That don't cut it. I bet you know the drill as well as I do, so make yourself comfortable. You boys see to it Mr. Lynch here gets photographed, fingerprinted, and tucked in. Let's go get some lunch. [man] Hey, come on, give me a break. She's one of America's top models, you think she's gonna be shy about one photo? If you don't back off, we'll have you all out of the building. -[journalists clamoring] -I said that's enough! -Now back off. That means you! -[journalists clamoring] You can't leave. There's gonna be a preliminary hearing. Now, if it makes you feel better, I'll move you to a hotel. But what more can I do? I've already told them everything. We have responsibilities. We want to assist the authorities in every way possible. Well, why can't you handle everything? I will, but you're the only eyewitness. [seagulls squawking] [man] Lieutenant Stone? I've videotaped all the damage topside, so I guess I'm finished? But on the other hand, you find anything interesting... Damn... They got a regular gift shop here. You mind telling me how you white folks hit your rocks off with all this stuff? Hey, don't knock it till you try it. Yeah. I read about this type of thing once. Rich people like the Ashby's. Got to find new ways -to get their kicks. -Is that a fact? Well, maybe you'd be better off doing less reading and more working. Before you start thinking about getting some strange kicks of your own. Ugh, you guys are like kids in a candy store. Exhibit A. [seagull squawking] [Stone] Now, I'm no sailor, but didn't she say Ashby went off the stern? This is where the murder was supposed to take place, right? -What do you mean "supposedly"? -I don't know. Just a gut feeling I have. Being at the back of the boat here, I was wondering who was at the wheel during the storm? The young lady says she was down in the cabin. Lynch and Mr. Ashby were fighting. Now, how do you figure a yacht could just drift out into the sea when it's anchored offshore? And since both survivors claim they swam to shore, who took the dinghy? [man] That's a good question. Hey. Hey. I think I found something. Take a look at this. Now, how many times have I told you guys not to touch evidence? You professionals or what? Norman, you surprise me. You, of all people... What exactly happened aboard that beautiful yacht? [Walter] Elizabeth? Elizabeth? Can you hear me? ...suspect in custody at this very moment. Where the hell are the rest of my fishing lures? How many times do you have to tell people not to mess with my fishing gear? [news reporter] ...vast Ashby fortune. -Their extravagant lifestyles...-[Elizabeth] Grandpa, there's a call from the police station. Somebody who says he knows you. Honey, do me a favor. Tell him I'm out of town. I already told him you were here. -You can pick up that one... -[Walter groans] ...and I'll hang up the kitchen phone. Yeah, this is Hill. What can I do for you? [news reporter] ...this tragedy One brother is missing... [Walter] Jack? Jack Lynch, my friend, how's the charter boat business treating you? Go where? [dog barking] [Jack] Look, Walter, all I know is I wake up on the beach with a mouthful of sand, and the next thing I know, they're accusing me of rape and murder. -But I swear to God-- -No. No. Let's leave his name out of it for the time being. The police said you can't remember anything about that fateful night. Told you, I got whacked in the head. I'm afraid that won't hold up for a judge. Listen, Walter, why would I rape someone that I've been sleeping with for about four months? -Is that a fact? -Yup. Her and Ashby, see, they, uh... well, let's put this way, they weren't exactly exclusive to each other. You know what I mean? This was an ongoing affair, sort of? Yeah, you might call it that. -Did Ashby know about it? -I don't know. I don't care. I mean, he must have figured something was going on? Did you and he ever have a confrontation about it? Nope. But he was acting a little strange the other night. The night he "accidentally" fell off the boat? Hey, Walter, there was a storm and that cat was drinking. [Walter] So... you and this young lady had been carrying on, and now she accuses you of murder and rape Why the sudden change on her part? I don't know. But I can tell you this. We were gonna take off together, you know. I mean, I'd have done anything for her. -Even kill somebody? -Maybe. Haven't you ever felt that way about a woman? Yeah. They're all something special. Some more than others. Look, I'm gonna do the best I can for you, but I sure hope that memory of yours returns along the way. [seagulls squawking] [cranking] [Ted groans] Hot... [grunts] I swear this boat is gonna kill me one of these days. Here. Too much work and no play make Jack a dull, dull boy. I'm no good with this mechanical stuff. Look at me. Can you believe this? This is what I hired you for, to do the dirty work. [grunts] I'm a captain, not a mechanic. Well, when there's two guys on the boat there's only room for one captain. Or did you think you were gonna stand around and salute the guest? I never learned how to salute anyway. Hey, lover. Come on. I got an itch I need you to scratch. Do it yourself. [Ted] Watch, Jack. Watch. She's like a shark. Yow! [Walter] So now she's accusing you of rape and murder. Why a sudden change on her part? I don't know. The police say that you've got quite a reputation as a ladies' man. Yeah, well, got to have a bad habit, that ain't such a bad habit to have, huh? So it seems, in your case. [Huston] I hope Mrs. Ford's feeling better. And I can't tell you how excited I am to be working for the Ashby family. -Morning, Lola. -[Jonathan] I appreciate that. Now, would you mind bringing me up to date on the case? The overalls pretty much lock it up. -The what? -The overalls. Yeah. They found the suspect's overalls covered with your brother's blood. So there's sufficient reason to believe that there was violence involved? Oh, absolutely. This should interest you. The police just gave us these photos. They were taken when Ms. Ward first arrived at the hospital. She'd been beaten up pretty badly, and the tests show there were signs of sexual intercourse. I think we have an airtight case here, Mr. Ashby. Murder, rape, not to mention kidnapping and hijacking. And what is being done about trying to find my brother's body? [Huston] Coast Guard's on it, as well as the local authorities. Everybody wants to get in the act. Let me assure you, Mr. Huston, that my family and I have no intentions getting into anyone's act. Now, if this Mr. Lynch is responsible, I intend on seeing that he is held accountable to the full extent of the law. Now, who is representing the defendant? Oh, he's a local attorney, Walter J. Hill. He's semi-retired. It shouldn't be a problem really. No? Well, then may I suggest you find out everything you can about him, personal, professional, whatever. I just want to know what I'm up against. Have a nice day. See you tonight. Dinner, eight o'clock. -[indistinct chatter] -[hip-hop playing on stereo] [Walter] About this murder trial, there's several possibilities. One, of course, is you didn't do it. Two, it was self-defense and justifiable homicide, and, three, it was an accident. What, do you want me to cop a plea? Unless you can discredit the only eyewitness. Whose side are you on? -You've got to get a defense. -Defense? They don't even have a body. They don't even have a murder weapon. How are they gonna get a conviction with that? Look, two men, one woman on a yacht. -[keys rattling] -One man comes back. Believe me, it's her word against yours. [indistinct chatter] -So, Walter, is that it? -[gate locks] [chuckles] -Do I stand a chance, or, uh... -[Walter] We'll see. Oh. One last thing. Why did Ashby tell you to head back to the mainland if he knew a storm was coming up? He didn't. Christina did. [Walter] I'll get back to you in a couple of days. [bell ringing] [insects chirping] [classical music playing] [indistinct chatter] -[clears throat] Hello. -Hello. Do they always stare like this or is it just me? I don't think they would like it themselves. I understand that. You know, you never think something like this will happen to you and... I want us to do our best to keep the focus off past history. I don't want any unnecessary publicity concerning my brother. Now, what did you find out about this attorney? [Huston] Well, it's not exactly what I thought. Harvard Law, partner in a major law firm for 23 years, past president in ACLU. In short, Mr. Ashby, we don't have a pushover here. What I think we need to do to prepare for this case-- I see. Now, Christina, Mr. Huston here will help you in preparing answers to some of the questions that might arise. Mr. Huston, I want to be sure that there's no probing around for skeletons in the family closet. You understand? [electrical crackling] -[Walter grunts] -[doctor] Rodent ulcer meets death by electrocution. Just about through here. That's why they finally came up with lethal injections. A hell of a lot more humane than what you're doing here. [chuckles] Skin cancer is not a pretty sight, my friend. You got to get underneath it and burn it up before it spreads. Well, we're all finished now. How long are you staying in town for? You wanna grab some lunch? No, I got some business to take care of -then I have to get back. -Oh, that's too bad. Er, you'll join me in a drink though. Easy now. I've got a lot of work yet to do. So come on then. Let's hear it. Well, I've taken on a new client. At your age, that's the best thing that could happen to you. -Nice choice of words. -[doctor] Okay, our age. I take it you've heard about the Ashby case? That's all everybody's talking about. In fact, I remember reading somewhere here about the girlfriend. -Oh, here it is. -Oh, let me see that. [doctor] I knew their father. We belong to same club. Yeah, real Cain and Abel story, those two. Good seed and bad seed. I didn't know the boys particularly well. It's just that Ted was usually in some kind of trouble due to his behavior. His lifestyle tended towards debauchery. He inherited half the family fortune and seemed hell-bent on spending it all as fast as possible. -And the girlfriend? -[doctor chuckles] Oh-ho... A real culture vulture, that one. Rumor has it that she used to do a little more than workout with the club trainer. If you know what I mean. [truck horn honking] [Stone] Three kings over a pair. I win. -[man] Ah, you got the kings. -[Stone] Yup. Save your money. -[man] Beats me. -[Stone] Hey, Jack. How you doing? We got a little card game going. -You want in? -Sure. [Stone] Deal this man in. All right. Sit here, Jack. I'm a little low on cash. [chuckles] We'll lend you some cash. That's cool. Yeah, we're just waiting for your lawyer to get down here, Jack. -Why? What's going on? -Got some bad news for you. Looks like your overalls got Mr. Ashby's blood all over them. That's because he was wearing them one time when he cut himself. [Stone] Hey, starting to get your memory back. All right. No, he-- he was, uh-- He was working in the engine room and, uh, he was wearing my overalls that day. He was putzing around down there. Never knew what the hell he was doing. [chuckles] I thought that's what he hired you for. [chuckles] No, he hired me to treat me like a dog. Is that right? Well, what happened then? What happened? Well, I heard some yelling, went down, saw that he was bleeding. He cut his left leg and-- so I took off to look for some bandages and, uh, couldn't find any on the boat. By the time I got back down the engine room, he had taken the overalls off and wrapped them around his leg to stop the bleeding. And what was the girlfriend doing all this time? You got me. She wasn't there. Is that right? So he just popped off to sleep, right? No hospital, no stitches, no nothing? Yeah. And he went back to his cabin and I... -I didn't follow him. -[Stone] Well, what did you do? I stayed and cleaned the engine room. So you cleaned up, and he took these overalls with your name on them down to his cabin where we found them. [Walter] Maybe he did and maybe he didn't. Hey, Walter, I heard he put a call in to you. Whew! Don't you fellows believe in air-conditioning? [Stone] How you doing? [Walter] Good to see you again, Lewis. Judge Parker has been kind enough to release the young man in my custody temporarily, and he's waiving bail until the outcome of this preliminary hearing. Nice hand, Jack. We'll be seeing you again real soon. [Walter] Come on, kid. My car is outside. [Stone] Okay. We'll start a new game. [car engine rumbling] [indistinct chatter] -Would you please? -Okay, okay! All right. I've got to go over to the mainland for some business. I'll be back in time for the hearing, all right? -You have to now? -Yes. Yes, I have to. I don't want you to leave me alone. Christina, you'll be fine. Just stay in your room. This will be over soon, I promise. The door, please. -[indistinct chatter] -[carnival music playing] [Walter] I've got to go pick up some sunblock. You wait here. Well, they're all fine. Everyone's been put back into working condition. There's film in most of them. You can actually go out and take photographs with them. [Christina] Do they work or are they just for decoration? [man] Both decoration and use. -Uh-huh. -Hi, Ms. Ford. Can I please have your autograph? Well, sure. -There you go. -Thank you. [Christina] You're welcome. [gasps] Oh, you startled me. Uh, ma'am, I saw you from across the street. Uh, I just wanted to check and see if everything is okay. Uh, it might be best if I just stay close, uh, in case any of the locals bother you. They're not used to having celebrities like yourself around. Aren't you nice? What was your name? [Norman] Officer Landis. [Walter] What was going through your head, kid? Our agreement was we played by the rules or not at all, remember? That was the deal. Just trying to find out why she's lying, Walter. Somebody's putting her up to this. [Walter] Why the hell are you so sure she needs help? Look, I'm not feeling too well. It's gonna take every bit of strength that I've got to save your butt, but don't you go and sandbag me, boy. I'm dropping you off at the house. You leave there and we're through, understand? Yeah. [Christina shivers] It's freezing down there. I had a dream about us. I was naked, and pure white snow was falling on me. Everything was so clean. Do you ever have dreams like that? No, I don't. I don't dream very much. No? You should use your imagination. Don't you ever want to do something special with your life? Like what? [Christina] Look around you, Jack, life's a banquet. Most people are starving to death. Maybe I'm not as hungry as most people. [Christina] You and I are a lot alike, you know? We've seen enough to know what's out there and we're strong enough to get it. Sometimes I feel so trapped. I wish I could get free. -You understand? -[Ted clears throat] What are you doing out here, my love? I couldn't sleep. It's too cold down there. It's freezing. Believe this shit? You wouldn't have a pot to piss in if it wasn't for me. Come on. Get back downstairs. [chuckles] And you, I'm watching you, Captain. Why don't you go get yourself a drink or a tranquilizer? Why don't I? If he so much as lays a hand on you, I'll kill him. And what if I put a hand on him, are you going to kill me too? Hmm? Are you? Hmm... I'm tired. Going to bed. [Christina] I have to go now. Sweet dreams, Jack. Come on. Come on, let's go to bed. [Walter] Are you listening to me? [truck horn blaring] Yeah. I understand. Fuck. Fuck it. Forget it. I've had it. [indistinct chatter] Hi. I wonder who she got caught sleeping with this time, huh? -Sure is a popular girl. -Yeah. [man] This latest breaking news. We've just received news that Jack Lynch, the chief suspect in the Ashby case has been released into the custody of W. J. Hill, a prominent local attorney. Next up, our special preview of the carnival week celebration continues. [birds chirping] [woman chuckles] Yeah, so then he said that we would go if it was all right with my parents. Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Hill. You wanted to hear about Christina Ford? Well, I can assure you of one thing, I wasn't her only, uh... shall we say, friend? Oh, I can assure you of that myself. But what I'm looking for is a sense of who the woman is. I mean, what's she like? Sexy. Very sexy. She just loves sex. But then again, who doesn't? [chuckles] Now don't get me wrong. I mean, she's a nice girl. The way she kept trying to improve herself and everything. But, you know, the Ashby family, they were-- They're kind of weird in their own right. I mean, Ted slept with anything. He always did. It's funny, because I thought she'd end up with the brother. What's his name? Jonathan? From what I heard, he was the one who had a thing for her. Yes, I've heard reports of that effect myself. What else can you tell me? [birds squawking] What are you doing out here? Found a dead bird so I buried it. Bet you never knew there was a kind of bird that didn't... didn't have no legs. Nope, no legs. So it has to live it's whole life on its wings in the sky. [sighs] It's true. It is. It's small. It's about... about the size of your baby finger. Doesn't weigh much more than a feather. Its wings they're... they're, uh... they're transparent so you can't see them. They... blends right into the sky, and that's why the hawks, they can't catch them. Even sleeps on the wind. It does. And it only lands one time. That's to die. [Christina] Jack, I fantasize about us. Do you like to play games? Yeah. Would you like to play a game with me? Yeah. I like to play bad. This yours? Nice. Really beautiful. Yeah, she is, isn't she? Got classic American lines. Right down to the fuel tank. That's the exhaust. King, queen, step, seats. It's got a lot of chrome. It's got acres and acres of chrome. Chromed engine. She's the smoothest, quietest... most reliable ride I've ever had. Do you love to ride? [Jack] Hmm. Yes. Yeah. She's a custom renegade love machine. [engine revving] [laughs] [dramatic music playing] [groans] I'd do anything for you. Will you do anything for me? [Elizabeth] Jack? Are you all right? [seagulls squawking] That bird was as free as the wind. Never got corrupted by... [chuckles] ...landing in the wrong place at the wrong time. Kinda like you? [chuckles] No, I didn't land. I was shot right out of the sky. -[water fountain gushing] -[tennis balls bouncing] [indistinct chatter, laughter] Excuse me, sir. This is a members-only club. Yeah, so I've been told. I'd like to ask you a few questions about a member. Ted Ashby. [sighs] Look, uh, this isn't the time or the place. And not to mention, it's the policy of the club neither to discuss or fraternize with members -or their guests. -Mr. Walter Hill, I'm Jonathan Ashby, pleased to meet you. [Walter] Pleased to meet you. [waiter] Is there anything I can get for you, Mr. Ashby? -No. -Uh, you could bring me -a scotch and water. -[waiter] Yes, sir. I sincerely hope I'm not imposing, sir. But it's come to my attention that you're defending the suspect of my brother's murder. It has not yet been determined that your brother -in fact was murdered. -Of course. Nevertheless, I'm surprised that an attorney of your stature and your reputation would get involved -in such a case. -Now you are imposing. For the record, let's just say I'm doing it to help out a friend in need. What exactly are your intentions? If you don't mind me asking. -I do mind. -I see. [Walter] And since you're in such a mood to discuss, uh, confidential information, perhaps you'd like to tell me a little about Ms. Ford? There have been rumors around. [waiter] Will you be staying for lunch? What? No, I'm afraid I'm late for an appointment. Do you mind my asking, where were you on the night of the incident? Well, my brother had asked me to meet him at the island. Unfortunately he never made it back, you know. Now, if you will excuse me. Have a nice day, Mr. Hill. Will you be staying for lunch, sir? No, no. Thanks for all the time, but just like you said, a members-only club and... having heard about some of the social activities, I don't think I'd like to join. [waves crashing] [Jack] This is one hell of a place you got here, Walter. You know what I love about it? The quiet, nurturing surroundings here. Whatever happened to this charter boat business of yours? It's-- I just missed a couple payments and the bank took it away from me. So you had money problems as well, huh? And Ms. Ford, did you know that she had other boyfriends besides yourself? Nope. Never asked. Why? Were there many? Well, none with reason to kill Mr. Ashby. Walter, why do you always make it sound as though you think I'm guilty? It is the prosecutor's job to prove that you did it, it's my job to show a reasonable doubt that you didn't. I don't pass judgments. Now, tell me. You love this girl or was there a financial interest? [scoffs] Well... let's just say I've seen enough bullshit, poverty and low life to last me a million years. I'll bet. But either one is motivation for the crime. Tough, ain't it? You're damned if you do and damned if you don't. I think it's about time we got down to some specifics here. -Want a cup of coffee? -[Jack] No thanks. [Walter] Maybe we better start at the beginning again. [laughs] I guess what it comes down to is... the haves and the have-nots, you know what I mean? And, uh... I just, uh... [Walter] You want to spell it out for me? I just want a break, that's all I want. I just want a break, I want-- I want my shot at the brass ring. There's a lot more at stake here than being broke. You're looking at a murder rap. Well, fuck 'em. Fuck 'em all. I didn't do a goddamn thing. Jack, you promised, you said you'd do anything for me. Tell me your secrets, Jack. [Jack] You shouldn't do this, Christina. [Christina] Tell me your secrets, Jack. You told me you'd do anything for me. -You promised. -[laughs] [Christina] What? Tell me. One time... a guy tried to kill me. Why? [Jack] He found some pictures of me. What kind of pictures? With his wife. That can be fun. Yeah. What happened? [Jack] He came after me with a gun. Then I... I... I took the gun away from him and... I shot him. And I shot him and I shot him. [knocking at door] [Ted] Jack? Captain Jack? -Yeah? -[Ted] Yeah, it's me. I thought you said he was out of town? [Ted] Oh, Jack. Come on. Time to go. Thank you. -What is this? -What? You're ready, aren't you? Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Yeah, I got a message to meet you down here. We're sailing in two hours, remember? -[Jack] Yeah. -[Ted] Today. -[Jack] Yes. -This wasn't on your resume. Let's go-- Oh, boy. Drinking, too, and-- Oh, and making movies, I guess. Look at this. A little home movie. A little-- a little movie about you? -No, that's... -You in a towel? [laughs] It doesn't work. -I'm trying to fix it. -[Ted] You're fucked up, Jack. Now, look. Get in the shower, take a good, cold shower. I'm gonna be here, I'll wait for you, and I'll take you to the boat and we'll go sailing today. -Yeah. -Okay? Maybe we'll even bring the camera. Now, now, now, come on, come on, come on. Come on. Come on. You explain later how-- yeah. How do you work this thing? I can never figure out these mechanical jobs. Can't work this mechanical shit. Don't worry, I'll figure it out. Fuck. Fuck. Oop. Don't mind if I break it. Jack, I'll tell you what... [Jack] What are you doing? ...and then I'm gonna go sailing by myself. Jack, you said you like to play games. [Walter] Listen, your jet-set friends take pretty good care of themselves, so, uh, let's just cut the bullshit get back to what happened on the boat that night. All I wanna know is if I get through this hearing -do I stand a chance? -Anything's possible. One thing sticks in my mind. If you're telling the truth, and you didn't beat her up, then who did? Well, I swear to you, I never hit her. [Walter] Even her statement said that he was killed the night before you were found. Oh, God. You have to leave. I warned you about playing games with me. [Walter] That would indicate that someone else was involved. Say Ashby died accidentally while she was with you, why wouldn't she come forward with the truth? Cheating on your boyfriend is not exactly a capital offense, you know? So somebody's putting her up to it. [thunder rumbling] The radio's out. [Walter] Why is she lying? Oh, I don't know, maybe it's the money. That's why she wanna marry Ashby in the first place. [Walter] No, no. I don't think she's the type of girl that Ashby would marry. Keep, maybe. Well, you see, they had, uh... [thunder rumbling] -We can outrun this storm. -[engine starts] They had this arrangement. [Walter] But the recurring question remains, why is she trying so hard to nail you? -[reporter] This is TNN... -[indistinct chatter] [reporter 2] Ms. Ford, Ms. Ford, can we have a word with you? Did you actually see the suspect shoot? [woman] How many times did he rape you? [Ted] Do not answer any questions. [reporter] What about the, uh, rumors regarding Mr. Ashby? Please, get out of my way! Could you get these cameras out? I'm warning you, get out. Don't worry, Ms. Ford, I won't let them hurt you. Mr. Ashby, what about a statement from you? This has been a very difficult time for the Ashby family. We only hope that justice will be served. -That's all I can say right now. -Thank you. [crickets chirping] [indistinct chatter] Excuse me, sir. [knocks on door] -[Jack] Room service. -It's about time. [grunting] Surprised to see me, baby? Huh? Don't worry, baby, I won't hurt you. I just wanna ask you a few questions. -Why are you lying? -No. No, no, no, you said we were in this together, baby. Uh-huh. -Didn't you say that? -[Christina] Uh-huh. Then why did you tell them I raped you? You left me on the boat. You told them I killed him. Why? [Christina mumbles] [knocking at door] [man] Room service. Just leave it. Look, you're crazy for coming here. You don't understand anything. It's Jonathan, he's crazy. He thinks he's in love with me. I have to lead him on or he'd never let us be together. Just wait until the trial, I'll tell them everything. I promise. Look, they can't convict you unless they find a body. Come on, Jack. Take the gun, use it on me if you don't believe me. Come on, Jack. I need you on this I can't do this all by myself. [Christina] It's just like we planned. We'll go away together, I've already got the tickets. [seagulls squawking] [Walter] Well, I was hoping to find something, but this is more than I expected. -Can I help you? [Walter] I'm Walter J. Hill, Jack Lynch's attorney. You know, you shouldn't be on this boat, Ms. Ford. Are you going to turn me in? Maybe. And then again, you scratch my back a little, I'll scratch yours. I have some experience in that area. [Walter] I'm sure you do. Would like to tell me what happened that night? The police reports will tell you everything. No, I'm not so sure of that. I've been hearing an entirely different story. Oh, I'm sure you have. Jack has a vivid imagination. I think the young man's in love with you. I'd say the word is "lust." Would you mind telling me what you were looking for just now? Look, you're not going to get anything from me, Counselor. So, why don't we just leave things as they are until we meet in court? [Walter] Maybe I should inform you that this is a judicial hearing, not a trial. But there are some things in your past that might come out during this hearing. You ask me a direct question and I'll give you a direct answer. Well, if that's the way you want it. All you'll find is that a long time ago I decided that the key to life was pleasing men. I've gotten pretty good at it and I know how to handle myself. I don't mean to seem hard, it's just that I've had to work for everything I've gotten, and I've come too far to give it up now. And I'm going to survive all this -with a clear conscience. -I'll sleep better just knowing that. [Christina] See you in the morning, Mr. Hill. [reporter] Carnival Week has begun and the hearing is standing room only for what could turn out to be the trial of the decade. According to inside sources, new damaging evidence has been found which could place Jack Lynch in a very compromising position. Wait a minute. Oh, here they come. -Come on. Let's get a shot. -[cameras clicking] -[woman] There she is. -[Michael] Excuse me. Excuse me. Ms. Ford, Ms. Ford, could you please, uh-- Ms. Ford, could we please have an interview, Ms. Ford? -[woman] Ms. Ford. -[reporter] Mr. Ashby. Ms. Ford, Ms. Ford. -Tragedy follows at every step. -I just wanted to... -Ms. Ford. -Ms. Ford. Will the controversy abound as to what happened that fateful night? [woman] I just wanna tell you that I think you're fantastic! [woman] Come on! [chuckles] Yes, of course! [speaking indistinctly] [man] Look, here they come. [man] Please stay back. No, no. Stay back. If you're not part of the proceedings, stay back. Go, please. Please. I asked you one, please. [man] Gee, Ms. Ford, can I have your autograph? [crowd clamoring] [Judge] Order in the court. [gavel bangs] Ladies and gentlemen, may I remind you that this is not a trial, it is simply a hearing to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence to prosecute. However, this is still a court of law, and if this kind of behavior continues I shall have each and every one of you thrown out. Mr. Huston, let's get started. [Wendell] Your Honor, I feel confident that we have sufficient grounds to proceed to trial in the Edward Ashby case. I brought in the medical examiner, Dr. Robert Scott, and nurse Vivian Donner, the first person to see Ms. Ford when she arrived at the hospital the night in question. I've also brought in the police officer who took Mr. Lynch's report of the supposed accident. You have a problem with any of this, Mr. Hill? The defense will have a few questions of its own, your honor. -Get on with it, Mr. Huston. -Thank you. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? [Dr. Robert] I do. [Wendell] Doctor, is it true that the blood type found on these overalls is Type A? Yes, sir. That's correct. And is it also true that Mr. Ashby's blood was in fact Type A? [Dr. Robert] Yes, that's what his medical record shows. Would you please tell the court the name written over the pocket on these overalls? Your Honor, let the records show that my client spoke of an injury suffered by Mr. Ashby a few weeks past while working on his yacht's engine wearing my client's borrowed work clothes. [Judge] Yes, acknowledged. [Huston] Doctor, with regards to the facts, were there any other tests performed by you in regards to this case? Yes, we did a DNA test. Would you please explain that procedure to the court? Well, in cases like this, blood testing has become obsolete compared to DNA testing. You see, the DNA code exists in every cell in the body, saliva, blood, uh, even the hair, our tests prove conclusively that the blood found on the overalls was that of Ashby, while the DNA code found after examining the rape victim was that-- [Walter] Your Honor, there seems to be a foregone conclusion that a crime of rape took place. In my client's statement, he does not deny having sex with Miss Ford. We simply refute that it was against her will. [Judge] Acknowledged. Dr. Scott, you will confine yourself to medical facts as you know them to be true, please. Thank you, Doctor. That'll be all. [Judge] Mr. Hill? Uh, no further questions, Your Honor. Thank you. -[Huston] In that case, I'd like to call the nurse on duty at the time of Ms. Ford's arrival at the hospital, Nurse Vivian Donner. Ms. Donner, would you please tell the court what you saw when Ms. Ford first arrived at the hospital? [Vivian] She looked like she'd been struck several times on her face. There was bruising around her throat. Um, she was naked except for a large linen shirt. She was crying and she told me that she'd been raped. [Huston] With regard to her appearance, would you please tell the court if these facial, throat, and other body marks could have happened in a fall or been self-inflicted in any way? No, sir. Not in my opinion. [Huston] Could you determine from her appearance the approximate time that these wounds were inflicted? [Vivian] Well, not exactly, but it was clearly just a short while before she arrived at the hospital. [Huston] Thank you. Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to call this witness back. [Judge] Mr. Hill, your witness. So you don't feel that this supposed beating could have taken place say, uh, 24 hours earlier or 12 hours earlier? Oh, no. That bruising was very fresh. And how exactly did Ms. Ford arrive at the hospital? It would be a very long walk from the port, wouldn't you say, for a woman in her condition? Not to mention having to swim from out past the reef to shore? [Vivian] Well, yeah. I guess so. It was late. [Walt] Did someone bring her? You know what, I actually did hear a car. So then I went over to the door and there she was, she was just standing there, the car must have left. Thank you. That'll be all. Your Honor, I have a statement from the police officers on duty that my client was with them at approximately the same time Ms. Ford was in the hospital. What I do wonder, though, is how she got there. And why she didn't use the yacht's dinghy... instead of swimming ashore. He's gonna call her up, I suggest we beat him to it. ...the dinghy, incidentally, that was missing from the yacht when the Coast Guard found it. [Huston] I'm sure Your Honor realizes that we reserve the right not to have Ms. Ford testify at this time, but in an effort to promote swift and fair justice, she agrees to come forth. Acknowledged. Get on with it, Mr. Huston. [indistinct chatter] [Judge] Order in the court. Martial, please. Quiet. Quiet, please. This applies to the press as well. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Yes, I do. [clears throat] [Walter] I realize what a terrible ordeal you've been through, Ms. Ford, but could you please tell the court what happened on Mr. Ashby's yacht the night he disappeared? Actually, it all started late that afternoon. Ted had given the crew the day off, except for Jack. The three of us had spent the day on the island together where Ted and Jack had been drinking. [Ted] That's why I hired you for, to do the dirty work. What did you think you were gonna be, standing around in white, saluting the guests? [Walt] Excuse me, but what exactly were they arguing about? Well, Jack wanted to head back to the mainland, but Ted insisted upon staying, so we finally just dropped anchor offshore. I got sick of all the fighting, it gave me a headache, so I went downstairs to lie down, but it only got worse. I thought if I left them alone they might stop fighting. I was really frightened... and I took out Ted's gun from the nightstand for protection, but it only got worse. Oh, God, you have to leave, he'll kill you. I warned you about playing games with me. He's crazy today. -That's it, it's gone too far. -Get out of here, you drunk. I warned you not to do this to me. I said get out of my way! I'm the captain of this boat. [slurring, grunting] [Ted grunts] -[panting] -[groans] [both grunting] [both groaning] [Christina] I could hear them fighting, knocking things over. It was always terrible when Ted would get on into these jealous rages. I went to see what was happening. [both grunting] [thunder rumbling] [both grunting, panting] [Christina] This was the worst storm I'd ever experienced. I could barely see through the spray. [grunting] [Christina] Then I saw Jack push Ted to the stern. And Ted grabbed for the railing, and Jack returned to the cabin. [screaming] Christina. Please! Please! Christina! [Christina] I was trying to figure out how I could help Ted. [screams] Christina! [Christina] Jack returned. He had the gun and he shot Ted again and again. Bullshit! Bullshit. That's a fucking lie. -That's a lie. -Clear the court. -[gavel banging] -Don't bullshit! She's lying! She's fucking lying. [men clamoring] She's fucking lying! She's lying. Why are you doing this? Marshals, get everyone out of here. -[Jack] Why are you lying? -[Judge] Come on. Why are you lying? Why are you fucking... -Clear the court! -She's... [grunts] [bangs gavel] Marshals, get everyone out. -It's all bullshit! -[Judge] Order. -[Jack] She's fucking lying! -[Judge] Order. Walter, she's lying! She's fucking lying! She fucking lying! She's lying! It's all bullshit! She's lying! [men clamoring] [Jack] She's fucking lying! Fuck you! Fuck-- She's lying! She's lying! [Jack shouting indistinctly] -[indistinct chatter] -[gavel banging] [Judge] Clear the court! Get them all out. [Jack] She's lying! [indistinct chatter] [man] ...murder case. Get your copy here. Murder and rape amongst the rich and famous. Photos, eyewitness accounts... Get your papers here. The Ashby-Ford latest... [sighs] Oh man. I just keep on thinking that it... just all should have turned out so different, you know. It's like-- I mean, I shouldn't have been on that fucking yacht to begin with. [Walter] You realize this hearing's as good as over, and you're going to have to stand in trial for murder. -She's lying about everything. -[Walter] Well, then, you tell me the truth. Can't. Either if you are one devious son of a bitch taking enormous chances with his own life or that lady has amazing powers of persuasion. [scoffs] Yeah. [sighs] Gentlemen, it's time to come in now. [man] Photo, eyewitness accounts, Get it all here. Get your latest copy here. Read all about it. Photos, eyewitness accounts, get your copy here in the famous murder case... [indistinct chatter] Can I have a minute, Mr. Ashby? [laughs] [man] I noticed that he was bleeding from his right ear. It appeared that he might have had a concussion. What did he say to you? He told us about the boating accident involving Mr. Ashby. Did you inspect the yacht personally Yes, we did. And we have a video tape to show exactly what condition the yacht was in when we inspected her. Proceed. We found a big tear on the haul. And yacht showed extensive damage on the starboard side. Also, we found traces of blood at the stern. -[Walter] Whose blood? -Mr. Ashby's. [Jack] I took the gun away from him. -I shot him. I shot him. -I object. Turn that tape off immediately. Your Honor, this is totally out of order. [Judge] Officer Miller, the court is confiscating this recording for further examination. And you better have an explanation for this or your entire department is gonna come under investigation. [Officer Miller] Your honor, I don't know what's going on here or how this happened, but this isn't the tape I shot. [Judge] Mr. Huston, do you have any explanation for this? [Wendell] Your Honor, no one informed me the tape's content. I only suggested that the police bring in a copy of this tape to better serve this hearing. [Walter] Your Honor, I move that we strike everything on this obviously edited and tampered with tape from the court record as any visible evidence. [Judge] I agree, Mr. Hill. Pending further inquiry. Officer Miller, you're excused for the time being Thank you. [Walter] Still, none of us can really be expected to totally disregard what we see or hear, but the fact of the matter is we have no body and no murder weapon. All we have is the word of Ms. Ford here to tell us what happened that night. And we understand that Ms. Ford could collect a substantial amount of money left to you by Mr. Ashby, which considering that you are carrying on numerous affairs... [Huston] I object, Your Honor. Ms. Ford is not on trial here for sexual activity or any other offense. Precisely my point. Maybe we have the wrong person arrested here. Mr. Huston would like to convince us that my client is a calculating, cold-blooded killer who planned a murder and yet couldn't help sleeping with the only eyewitness. Not to mention leaving behind a videotape and enough evidence for a prosecutor even with his questionable ability to get-- I object to the personal attack, Your Honor. Murder is personal, Mr. Huston. And I might I say that your client might be one of the most personable people I have ever met. I have a list here of some of her so-called relationships. I object. This is disgraceful. Just what are you accusing my client up, Mr. Hill? [Walter] That we're dealing with a woman who's whole life is based on dishonesty. Why should we believe what has she say now? And more importantly, which of those relationships drove that car to the hospital, Ms. Ford? And what about the yacht's dinghy? Did Mr. Ashby, by any chance, use the dinghy to get off the yacht? Is this just a cover up to convict my client of a murder that never happened? [Christina] Stop. Just stop it. [Christina screams] [indistinct chatter] Help her. [all clamoring] [man] Somebody help her. Please. Please. Somebody help. Please! Clear the court. [man] Somebody help her. [Judge] Marshals, see that she gets to a doctor immediately. [cameras clicking] [indistinct chatter] Marshals, get everyone out of the court. [Marshal] Okay. Clear the court. Clear the court. Get out the way. Hey, mister, I said out of the way. Clear the court! Dammit, come on. Move! The proceedings have been called to a halt. It appears that Christina Ford apparently injured herself. The marshal has just taken her to a hospital. All hell is breaking loose here. This is Michael Altman coming to you live. [man] I want a complete report on Ms. Ford's condition as soon as possible. And I also want that police video examined by independent experts, and held by the court until further notice. Also, I want a list of anyone who might have had access to the tape. [Judge] Mr. Huston... Gentlemen, I realize this is not a trial, but I have in mind to have you both brought up in front of the bar association. I will not tolerate this kind of behavior. And believe me, someone is gonna have a lot to answer for this videotape business. Now, I'm calling a recess until we determine the seriousness of Ms. Ford's injury. Before you do, Your Honor, I think I have information that significantly changes the complexion of this hearing. Mr. Huston, so help me, I'm one step away from holding you in contempt. Your Honor, I've just received confirmation from the police on the mainland that Jack Lynch, the very same Jack Lynch we have here today, was charged with assault with a deadly weapon late last year. The charges were dropped due to extenuating circumstances, Your Honor. Read: self-defense. But I would like you to note that Mr. Lynch shot a jealous husband six times at point-blank range. Did your client also lose his memory regarding that incident, Mr. Hill? [birds chirping] -Evening, Ms. Hill. -Hi. Come on in. -Thanks. -Grandpa, it's for you. It's the police. [clears throat] Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Hill, but we got an anonymous tip regarding some evidence that apparently was overlooked during our preliminary investigation on the yacht. And, uh, we found, uh... this. That's the gun that was on the yacht. -Christina... -[man] It has your fingerprints all over it. The lab is running some tests to determine how recently it was fired. I never fired that gun. [officer] Under the circumstances, we're gonna have to revoke your custody arrangement. I'm afraid you're gonna have to come with me. I supposed somebody just shoved it into your hands. -Actually, yes. -She did it, didn't she? I already told you everything I know. Maybe you didn't do, but you didn't stop it either, did you? -He fell. -So, he fell on the water and she had sex with you immediately afterwards. You have a very serious desire to test your luck, friend. [laughs] Yeah, well, I don't think you'd understand. Did you ever get the feeling that maybe you were being used? Thank you, Mr. Hill. Goodnight. -So what do you think? -[door closes] Well... it's been my experience that when it comes to women, men can just be convinced of just about anything. [seagulls squawking] [Judge] The hearing is now called back into session. And while, on the one hand, I'm holding the supposed murder weapon, I've just received a communique from the Coast Guard that a man's body was found entangled in a fishing net under the Ashby yacht. That this body has been preliminarily identified as that of Ted Ashby. Furthermore, this body bears no signs of any bullet wound. [crowd gasps] [Judge] Now, this hearing has been overrun with a kind of malicious mendacity that I have never previously experienced in all my years on the bench. But before this hearing is finally concluded, which it is about to be, I would like to talk to the prosecutor about the consequences of these recent findings, particularly with regard to Ms. Ford. [Wendell] Your Honor, my client, Mr. Ashby, would like to recommend that Ms. Ford undergo a psychiatric evaluation before this court considers the possibility of further hearings with regard to this matter. [Judge] Judging by her actions in this courtroom I can understand the need. Young lady, would you rise please. Do you have anything to say for yourself? Your Honor, I know in my heart I've done nothing wrong. Really? I didn't think you have any clear idea of the seriousness of your actions. Lying in a courtroom is an abuse of the law, Ms. Ford. This is a matter of perjury, Mr. Huston. Well, look who we have here. We've had bodies turning up everywhere this morning. -You've heard the latest? -[Dr. Brooks] Yeah, sure. Get this. The local medical examiner overlooked one very important biological fact... [Judge] I am recommending that you be released into the custodial care of Mr. Jonathan Ashby until such time as a psychiatric evaluation can be completed. Now, this hearing -is officially closed. -[gavel bangs] [indistinct chatter] Mr. Huston, would you be so kind as to escort Ms. Ford back to the hotel? You did it, Walter. You really did it. No, I'm afraid the young lady did it to herself. Yeah. It, uh... [chuckles] Listen, why don't you meet me across the street in a bar. There's a-- there's a few things I got to get straight with you. Oh, that'll be a new twist. Talking of twists, I prefer mine a dry martini. I'll get out of here. I'll meet up with you later. [indistinct chatter] [Walter] Mr. Ashby... would you mind my asking what kind of game you've been playing here? Game? Things do seem to have gone a little out of control, yeah. For the self-appointed protector of the family name, you took this latest turn of event much better than I would have expected. It's all real tragic. But I am satisfied that my brother's death was an unfortunate accident, nothing more. What else is there to say? Ms. Ford was most fortunate that you stood by her throughout this ordeal. Well, all families have their ups and downs. Now seems quite evident that Ms. Ford's emotional state is more imbalanced than we previously thought. Maybe so. But it's too bad that whoever did the killing didn't follow the plan as they were told to. I beg your pardon? Look, I'm just trying to fit a few last pieces together. A medical associate of mine was kind enough to inform me of a little-known medical fact, the matching DNA of identical twins. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Don't let your imagination run wild, sir. And what about your own feelings about the lady? From what I hear, you're the one that was in love with her. Now you're reaching, and you're way out of line. -Is that so? -Yes. -Hey, Ted, you forgot something. -Nice try. [officer] They don't care about her. They're all using her. It's all about money, my friend. It's all one big merry-go-round. Some of them get hold of the brass ring, but most of them fall off the horse trying to get it. They're not gonna hurt her anymore. I'll see to it. I won't let them. Well, guess everybody's disappointed now that the show's over. Not till the fat lady sings, counselor. [chuckles] You're taking any bets on what's gonna happen next? It's getting damn hard to figure out the horses -without a scratch sheet. -Yes, sir. And that Mr. Ashby, he's something. I mean, I've seen a whole lot of hard-boiled eggs in my time, but that one, he got to be 20 minutes. Which Mr. Ashby are you talking about?

You pretend to believe something long enough and it finally becomes true for you. Everything's changing for me now. That lady didn't lie about the murder out of love for you. Take my word for it, kid. [upbeat music playing] [cheers and applause] Walter, you don't understand what I'm saying. There was no murder. It was an accident, just like I told you all along. I think you should know that Ted Ashby was not the man who fell off that boat. He's the one who set it up. They did it together. [cheers] They played you and Jonathan both well, son. [indistinct chatter] [Ted] Please. Please. [indistinct chatter] [upbeat music playing] [woman] Can I have your autograph please? Please? [overlapping conversations] [chuckles] Sure.

I'm afraid, that as the judge said, you're in desperate need of help. Plans have changed. What are you talking about? You can't do this to me. I've done it, my love. Goodbye. -Ms. Ford, come along with us. -Wait. Just a minute. It's long over time. What are you talking about, my love? [suspense music playing] -What about our plans? -We're finished.

You haven't done anything stupid yet. Why start now? [dramatic music playing] [Dr. Lascus] So, Christina, when you saw Mr. Ashby die so violently that night, what were your feelings? [Christina] I went numb. I don't even remember crying. [Dr. Lascus] And now? What are your feelings about Mr. Ashby now? [Christina] Well, as you know, I loved him. And I guess I love Jonathan too, but more as a brother. [Dr. Lascus] The police suggested that the man who was killed was actually Ted masquerading as his brother. [Christina chuckles] I think the police have a vivid imagination, Dr. Lascus. [Dr. Lascus chuckles] You've had a lot of time to reflect back on that night in the storm. What do you now think happened? [Christina] The only logical explanation is that Ted and Jack came up with a scheme to fool the insurance company, and it went terribly wrong. I knew Ted was having money problems. He and Jonathan argued about finances all the time. And Jonathan was pressuring Ted to sell the Christina. [Dr. Lascus] That yacht? Yes. And how do you feel about the court order awarding her to you? [Christina] I guess I'm flattered. And to be perfectly honest, it was very reassuring to know that the court decided that Ted and Jonathan would have wanted me to have it. [Dr. Lascus] And what about returning to normal life now? [Christina] Are you saying that I'm ready to leave? To go back to the... [Dr. Lascus] The what? The world? Normal life? Oh, yes. I think you're fine now. [Christina] But, Dr. Lascus, I don't know that I can get along without you. I guess, I really don't want to get along without you. [Dr. Lascus] I'm sure you'll be fine. Besides, leaving the clinic doesn't necessarily mean we can't see each other. [Christina] Do you mean that doctor? [Dr. Lascus chuckles] Yes. [chuckles] There you are. Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in a toast. To my beautiful new bride. Christina Ford-Lascus. [all] Christina. [Dr. Lascus] Darling, may our marriage be one long smooth, calm sail for life. Maestro, strike up the band. Go on. Enjoy yourselves. [laughter] [woman] Hey, music's here. It's a party. Tonight.
