C. Good... E. Good. - B. - Are you sure? - B flat. - Well done. This one's difficult. F sharp. Perfect, you're very good! This is for you. THE BALL Grandpa? Grandpa? You think I can't find a pair of tap dancers? Okay, I?ll call you. - Monica! - Thanks! Thanks. - You could have told me. - We discussed it! - I don't feel like it. - I already signed. When? Music is beautiful and simple, you just have to read the notes. Seven notes, and then play them, one after the other. I?ll do what I want! Words are different, however. You never know what they mean. - You're weird, Monica. - Because I make my own decisions? - We discussed it a 1000 times... - When? Don't interrupt me! It was your dream to sing at the "Dancing Moon". Who told you that? How dare you take on commitments for me... - Are you crazy? - You should have asked me! - Think it over, then... - Shut up! Pull over. Stop, will you! - Raul, get out. - Don't be stupid! A walk will do us good. Come on. - Mom! - Let's go! - Run! - Monica, where are you going? - Where are we going? - Home. Let's go this way. You're screwing up! You won?t see me again! It's my English test tomorrow, I have to get up early. Exactly, hurry up! Hurry up? At 4 in the morning, surrounded by owls! Roberto wasn't the greatest, but he was "one". "One" and that?s all. At least for a while. They were all wrong. You see it right away... after. The problem is seeing it before. Roberto managed dance-hall singers, so he also managed mom. He was a bit superior, but he wasn't bad and he lasted longer than the others. Before him there was Piero, an intellectual. When one wakes up, one should recite a poem. Well, I think so. He'd tell me his philosophy over breakfast. Like: "I enlighten myself with greatness". He called it "Morning", then changed the title to "Sea". Was it "Morning" first, or vice versa? Was it "Morning" and then "Sea", or the other way around? Through the ups and downs, he lasted 3 months. Cigarette? Right, never before midday. Before Luigi, after Francesco and Fabio, there was Mauro. - I'm a musician, too. - He was weird. Classical? Rock? Jazz? - Leo. - I only saw him once. He tried to be likeable, but he didn't manage it. Rapper? How will we communicate with the aliens? Giuliano was crazy... We'll put on a nice piece of Led Zeppelin! but he was nice. "Stairway to heaven". He was mom's favourite, too. But one day he left and hasn't been heard of since. His last words were... Rock music is the only proof that God exists. Simone was meticulous. Actually, he was pedantic. He followed everything to the letter. HOW TO GROW MARIJUANA Raul! Raul, you continue. You're nice and relaxed, go on. - Go... - G, B, C. - G, E, C. - G, B, C. It's a B. You'd know that, if you followed the score. Manuela, from the top. Manuela was always hanging around and saying weird things. Ever thought about kissing a girl? I've tried to imagine what it must be like, but tongues frighten me... and that?s not all. Raul, let's go. I?m coming. Bye, Manuela. Bye. They're my friends, Giovanni and Milhaus. During the test in class, are you crazy? - They could expel you! - Shut up, here it comes. - Fantastic! - Disgusting. - We've got... - Basile smoking in the toilets. The technical drawing teacher stealing pens... - The deputy head on the phone... - We need Taschetta and Franchini. - Maybe I?ve got an idea. - What? There's a staff meeting tonight. We could wait outside school with the video camera. I?m sorry about last night. I thought we were closer to home. The main thing is you left him. Wait, Raul... - How do I look? - It's cold outside. Besides that, how do I look? Everyone says she's beautiful and that's the trouble: everyone says it. I?m more experienced, you don't know how to do it. Zoom in on Franchini. I was with my friends, but I was thinking about mom and her doomed love affairs. I had to help her, but how? Find her a man, the right one. But where, how? And then how do you know he?s the right one? It whirled round in my head like an obsession. I had to focus on someone I knew well. - Franchini's so great-looking. - But who? What's up? Nothing, I was just thinking. - About her? - Who? "Steel Teeth"... Manuela. We saw you on the bench. - We were just talking. - With a girl? What about? Shut up. What's going on? That's some meeting! I thought about what Giovanni had said, Manuela, mom. Suddenly, looking into the camera, I got an idea. Medri! Antonio Medri! Music teacher. Opera and classical music fan. Single. Enrico. Nice to meet you. These are great! I hate it when, just because they've slept at my place, they have to try to be nice. - Are you collecting them? - No. - Get ready or you?ll be late. - I?m never late. I?ll give you a lift on my motorcycle. - I?ve got a bike. - What kind of bike? Bianchi: double brakes, 6 gears, 3 crown wheels, 18 speeds, red. - I had one just like that. - What model was it? It was... a bike. - It had two brakes... - Disc or back pedal? Well, what type of bike? Mountain bike, racing... It was a nice bike, it had two wheels... - Understand? - Go and get your school-bag. Enrico... wait. - Look, it?s fantastic! - How does it start? Look at the shock absorbers. Let's go, it's late. It's eight, Medri will yell at us. Let's go! - May I? - It's yours? - Yes. - How fast is it? - Once I reached 260. - Let's go. 260! Did you go for a ride? No! Let's go. Raul... Whenever you want. My dad can't manage more than 90. Who's he? To play a song with another person, you have to get to know them well. - I didn't understand. Repeat it... - Well... For a romantic evening, do you prefer: A) rock; B) a sonata by Bach. C) pop music? - Is this for the Italian test? - No, the school newspaper. - All right, Bach. - So that's B. Perfect. What quality do you value most in a woman? A) beauty; B) intelligence; C) tenderness? Quality... in a woman? I wouldn?t know... That's enough, just tell me what this is all about. Well? The toughest thing when playing together is changing rhythm, improvising. I want to do the recital. In a year?s time, like everyone else. You know I can do it, if I apply myself. I can do it now. I don't see why you should be the exception. - The subject's closed. - I want to go to the conservatory. The conservatory? I?d got myself into a mess, but I had achieved something. Medri and my mother would meet. Hi. - Hi, Raul. - Hi, Manuela. Feel like a bike ride? I?d like to, but I have to do my homework. See you tomorrow. Mom! Mom! Mom! Definitely not! No, I just don't want to do that kind of music anymore. I?ve had enough. Bye, I?ll call you later. Hi, Raul. What happened? I?m leaving the orchestra. The orchestra? - Grandpa's orchestra? - Yes. Why? Because I want to play my music. - Where are you going? - To my room! May I ask you a question? Are you surprised by your son?s decision? Yes, actually. My mother?s a singer. She passed on her passion for music to me. - You sing? - I used to. I don't now. For a while at least. My grandpa was a musician, too. - This is his CD. - Oh, an accordion player. Great! No, you can keep it. Thanks. And this is your score. I?ll expect absolute dedication starting from next week. Well, thank you. Goodbye. It was nice to meet you. Why do you always have to embarrass me? - Embarrass you? - You and your ideas! What did I do? When you tell someone about me, tell me first. And when you make a decision, I want to know first. Since when do we talk about anything first? In your opinion, do you have to stick it out? - What? - Your tongue. Do you have to stick all of it out, or do they meet halfway? It depends. If she's experienced... Well, it depends. Yesterday I asked Cristina out. What did she say? She's got a boyfriend, like all the rest. - It's all down to luck. - But ten out of ten... Keep trying, beginnings are difficult for everyone. I think you should just ask one girl out. The right one. Just focus on her and then... Right? How about a PlayStation session? I can't, I've got to practise the clarinet. What do you think? Any good? What would you like to play? I don't know. How about a ballroom number? One of your grandpa?s. This mazurka, for example. Wow! But on the clarinet? Well, it would need a bit of work, but I?ll help you. You need a piece of music for the recital, but who cares if it's not Mozart or Bach? - Really? - Why not? Great! There's a Schubert concert the day after tomorrow. It's not an unmissable occasion, it's an obligation. All right? Of course it was, I was going to take mom, too. Okay. Thanks for everything, prof. Mom! Mom! It's nothing, just a bad moment. I practically fell asleep, but mom seemed to be moved by the music. And Medri? What a let-down, he was with a woman... Who was she? Must be his sister or a cousin. Franchini again, what a drag! Sorry, but I didn't find anything else. There is something beautiful and right in the world: Franchini! Never mind Franchini, what about Medri? Nothing yet, but I have a good feeling about him. I?ll be on the look out tomorrow. - If you have any luck, let me know. -Yes. I?d convinced Medrito to use grandpa's music in class. I was sure mom's voice would enchant everyone, especially him. Apart from Manuela, no one seemed to appreciate this work of art. Focus on the melody. The melody is very simple, almost elementary. And the chords structured around it are also... very simple. That's how I realized Medri didn't like ballroom music. And maybe not even mom's voice. I liked that song very much. Thanks. Really, I like how she sings. - You really mean it? - Of course. With that voice she could become a great singer. Has she got a boyfriend? It's a pity, she's beautiful. What about your dad? - What about him? - Who is he? Where is he? He teaches the tango in Argentina. Really? How wonderful! It must be hard. That music is my music, whether you like it or not! You can hear it on Thursday if you want. I?m giving a concert. - Well done! Very good indeed! - Thanks. You've made great progress. My mom?s giving a concert tonight. Will you come? Maybe. I wanted to ask you... honestly, did you enjoy the concert? It was the worst concert of my life so far. Maybe it's not my style. Maybe it's the same for me: ballroom isn't my style. - She doesn't do ballroom stuff. - Really? Well, in that case I might drop by. While my mother sang her "music", as she calls it, I sat at the bar with Marcello, waiting for Medri. But he didn't come. When she finished singing, mom didn't know where to look. The evening was a disaster. No one had clapped or even whistled. Total indifference. There was a heavy silence in the dressing room. Mom looked as if she was about to cry, but then she smirked weirdly. She didn't say a word. I always said ballroom music was better. What can compare to being overwhelmed by the sax, drums, guitar, bass, clarinet and accordion! What can you do with just a piano? - Hello, Raul. - Good morning, prof. Good morning. - How did the concert go? - It was fine. I?m sorry, unfortunately I couldn't make it. - It doesn't matter. - Well, maybe next time. See you in class. You want to see the teachers after school, too? No, it was a... a concert. - Hi, Raul. - Hi. "Hi, Raul"! Stop being morons! Let's go. Agent RAT94, can you hear me? Loud and clear, agent K92. What can you see? Hostile artillery on the side of the hill. Retreat immediately to the back lines and await orders. Roger. Awaiting orders. Come here. Where? This way! Follow me. Stop, this is his mom's room! Are you still on reconnaissance? Where are you? Let's not bullshit around. Can you see my mom in this? It's like a whore's stuff! Agent K92 calling agent RAT94. Do you read me? - This looks great on you! - Come off it... I knew it, look. Come on, cut it out. Put everything back. Look! Raul's mom really is a slut. This one really suits you. What's wrong? Why are you still awake? You've got school tomorrow, sleep. That's what I was trying to do. And so are you... Today we?re going to focus on pronunciation, so repeat after me... Now repeat it by yourselves. Now open your exercise books, copy the sentences on the blackboard and practise the pronunciation at home; it must be perfect by Friday. You know what I saw in Raul's mom's drawers? Underwear like you couldn't even imagine! She has a pair of panties that show off her whole ass! I think she changes her outfit with everybody she picks up. You can see everything? Yes, everything. Just like a whore's stuff. ...story-teller of errant knights, of quests and victories of the just over the powerful to stay locked up in my room with my books like a useless coward, deaf to all imposition. Oh, Dulcinea del Toboso! You are much distressed today. Stop it, you bastard! How can your sweet mouth proffer such words? I said cut it out, you dickhead! Fuck off! What's going on? Raul! Giovanni! Come here! I?ll split your head open! I?ll split you in two! The headmaster! Well? Who started it? He started it. I was playing at Don Quixote and he thumped me. He's crazy! Calm down. Why did you do that, Raul? Answer the headmaster, please. Raul? I felt like it. Come on! Hit me. Why should I? It's not Giovanni you're mad at, is it? - Look at me. - I?m looking at you. Raul, you're my son, not my judge. I like men, so what? Is it a crime? You think I should do everything in secret? Tell you I?m at a friend?s and then book into a hotel? Or should I just wait for the right man to show up? He never will! At least I managed to make you optimistic. What do I care? I'm used to it by now. - Where are you going? - Leave me alone. - Raul! - Leave me in peace! - Raul! - Fuck off! All of you go get fucked! Raul! Come outside! So in the end I got pneumonia and was in bed for three weeks. I don't remember much about it, I had a high fever and only wanted to sleep. Milhaus visited. I came to see how Raul is. Can I say hello? Now I remember, there was also that traitor, Giovanni. But I was too sick to have visitors. Manuela called every day, sometimes more than once. But I didn't want to speak to anyone. It's Manuela, do you want to talk to her? No? OK. Manuela, I?m sorry... Hello? Oh, good morning. A certain Marino Binacci called often, too. Yes, I?ll call her. Mom! I?m coming! - Is it for me? - Binacci. Hello, Marino? Mom went off to talk to him and seemed very happy. Only one man came to the house during that time. Raul! Professor Medri's here to see you. And for once I was very pleased. He realised that he loved Galatea, too, so he took a rock and split it in two. And that?s how the river... Even mom seemed happy. She was so excited she even burnt the chicken. - What?s that smell? - The chicken! - Wait, it could be... - Completely burned. - Do you want to try? - Let's see, maybe... No more dinner! Sometimes appearances can be deceptive. - Where shall I put it? It's hot! - Put it here. - Can any of it be saved? - I don't know, it looks serious. But maybe if we take this crust off... Have you got a serving fork and a carving knife? - Yes. - If we take off the crust... What else do you want? Another casserole dish, butter and lemon. Cardamom seeds, but I don't think... It's a Thai recipe, stewed chicken with butter and lemon peel. - Is this dish okay? - Perfect. Here's the butter and lemon. Now, very carefully, because otherwise it could crumble... then you amalgamate. - Some sultanas would be great. - I don't have any sultanas. Lemon peel... - Do you want me to do it? - Yes... Maybe with a bit of luck we can do it. Thai... Sorry, I'm late, I didn't have time. They slaughtered us. Three tests in class! The first... I?d started to feel better, but not well enough to go back to school. Anyway, Milhaus brought me the homework... or sometimes Manuela did. Let's name the regions of Italy: Piedmont, Aosta Valley, Liguria. Giovanni dropped by several times, too. I brought Raul's homework. May I come in? But when he came, my fever was always too high. "Marino Binacci". That's who it was! I?m going, sweetheart. I love you. She said it to me often during that time and maybe she expected me to say: "Me, too", but I still couldn't manage it. - Bye. - Bye. Manuela will stay and keep you company. Antonio! Sorry, I?m a bit late. So will you come with the car? To see them together, like boyfriend and girlfriend, seemed like a dream. But it wasn't a dream, it was real! That's enough! He takes her to dinner... at the best restaurant in the area. They talk, discover they have the same tastes, then he brings her home "Would you like to come up?" she asks. He says: "No, goodnight. It was a wonderful evening". Maybe a kiss. Yes, why not? The first date. - Good morning, Raul. - Oh, good morning. Is Monica in? Yes. - Mom! - If she's sleeping, don't worry. I just have to give her this. She lent it to me. And give her this, too. They're a few notes on the number. - Are you coming back to school? - Yes, I?m better now. - Well then, I?ll give you a lift. - Why not. Medri. Antonio Medri, music teacher. - What have you got this morning? - Opera and classical music fan. - I mean what subjects. - English and maths. So, you've got a maths test, then. Don't worry. She seems harsh, but in the end the test is easy. Caring, kind... nice. - Hi, Raul! - Hi. - You're back! - Yeah, see? - Raul, your exercise book. - Good morning. - You left it in the car. - Thanks. - Why were you in Medri's car? - Oh... nothing. Then it?s true, you're in league with the professor. Listen, can you keep a secret? - Medri and my mom are in love! - In love? - What do you mean? - In love. - After all, they're musicians. - But he's a teacher! You can't stay in the same school as the man who is with your mother. - It's illegal! - What the hell do you mean? The law says so. There can never be a law against true love. I thought the great moment had arrived. I have some important news. On the 22nd I?m singing with The Public Enemies. Unfortunately, I was wrong. A new song, written by me. With Marino Binacci's group. It's a great chance! Are you happy? Yes. - Will you come along? - Sure. It'll be a big success this time, you'll see. I?d never seen her so happy. But she didn't even mention Medri. Anyway, Giovanni said he had proof that Franchini was a slut. Milhaus had bet a fortune that it wasn't true. Hi, Raul. Have you come to be a witness? - You'll see, it's a real scoop! - Anyway, it's not true. - Show us or pay up. - You'll see who pays. Look. Franchini and Medri together! They're colleagues, acquaintances. So what?s this? - They're just friends. - Now they kiss. Great stuff, eh? I?m a genius! Go fuck yourselves! All of you go get fucked! Medri is his mom's boyfriend, you idiot! - Here, take your money. - I don't want it. I?m sorry, Raul. For everything. Forgive me! Yes? Oh, hello? No, Raul hasn't said anything. I?ll call him. Raul! Raul! It's Professor Medri. Why did you skip the lesson? How will you do the recital now? I?m not doing the recital anymore! Raul, come here. Come on! Raul! Why don't you want to do it? What happened? It's nothing to do with the recital. What do you mean? Well? I found out the truth. The truth? About what? Medri's got another woman. Meaning? Medri's seeing our English teacher. So? That's it, the truth? Sorry... Perhaps the pain of what I?d just said was driving her crazy. Because you thought... Suddenly, it was all clear to me. Raul? Raul, come on, open up. Raul? - Come on! - Leave me alone! I?m sorry you were offended. You're destined to be disappointed by me. But I?m doing my best. Do you believe me? I love you. I couldn't care less about your shitty concert! Understand? Goodbye. Let's go. Raul, come here for a moment. - You can go. - Goodbye, prof. What?s this piece of paper you handed in? It's not a music test paper. So, what is it? It's what you see. I see pauses. This is a music that's impossible to play. It's not music. What is it? It's my music. Goodbye, professor. - Stop it, Monica. - No... It's fear. You're scared. It's just nerves. Come on, try. I?ve lost my voice completely. Monica, showtime in ten minutes! Excuse me, I?ve just been told that Monica Castellini's presence is still uncertain. - Marcelo! - Raul! - Where's my mom? - She's lost her voice. - I?ll get her a tranquillizer. - Yes, but where is she? In her dressing room, Round the corner, at the end. Mom! Mom! It's Raul. I wanted to tell you that... Nothing, I?m here. I came to hear you sing. And then I wanted to tell you... I love you, mom. Let's welcome Monica Castellini! Well done! Well done, Monica! So mom finally sang and I think she sang quite well, without hitting any wrong notes... well, almost. Of course, you could see she was nervous, but the audience liked her. And she was, yes, I think she was happy. Manuela is still a mystery and we?ve know each other for a long time. If only it was enough to look at her to understand! Manuela, do you think that we... Would you kiss a girl with lipstick? I don't know... Women like to be kissed with lipstick on. Careful! It went well this time! Come on, let's go! But there has to be a way to understand sooner, before it?s too late, if it's the right person.
