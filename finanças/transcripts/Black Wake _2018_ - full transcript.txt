AGENT MILLER: Johnson, I'm calling it in. Headquarters is ready to send military backup on my word. Stay focused. She is the key to the source. She's always been the key. Yeah, well, I don't think she's here alone. Agent Johnson file 69232B. Constant 24-7 surveillance so far has garnered nothing but mundane daily life. We continue to monitor the subject with no extraordinary results so far. At current, the subject is completely unaware of our probe. She continues to live her current identity with apparently no recollection of what has happened to her. We remain vigilant gathering and documenting all information and will keep the Bureau aware of all developments. Dr. Luiza Moreira? - Dr. Luiza Moreira. - Moreira. You must be Dr. Jones. Yes, but you can call me Vincent. Please sit. I'm part of a team of experts in various disciplines. Your background in psychology and cultural anthropology plus your work in South Africa is exceptional. We all came together to help solve a case or outbreak or... I don't know what it is. I've decided to keep a video record of all facts and findings. It's been very crazy lately. We just received another victim. So are they victims or infected? How much have you been briefed on? Not much. Authorities up and down the East Coast thought they were dealing with some sort of serial killer, I guess. Well, bodies have been showing up along the eastern seaboard. Maybe beyond. Police were discovering bodies. Skulls smashed, parts of the brains missing. But the timelines didn't match up. The victims... six at first... all died within roughly the same time period, across several states. Law enforcement officials shared information and determined... - Sheriff Williams? - Yep. - What're these guys doing here? - Oh, it's okay, it's the press. I called them. Look, I am gonna warn you now. It's not a pretty site. We've been sharing information with other law enforcement officials. What has been determined that a single killer cannot do all this. He can't be in several places at the same time. It's impossible. I'm tired of the Feds saying there's a serial killer out there. There's no serial killer. It's not one person doing this. You see what's on tis landscape here? Earlier today I found two women at a camp site. First they're alive and just like that, they both dropped dead right in front of me. There's some crazy shit going on here, and the public needs to be aware. You gotta know what's going on. Open your eyes be aware. DR. MOREIRA: Investigators thought maybe it was a cult. Like Manson. It's a bunch of Satanists all along the shore. Some kind of crazy cult. Just chopping people's bodies up and eating like their brains like some type of devil worship! It's sick! The skulls weren't smashed in. They had burst outward. I'm presenting you something... I was contacted to join this team. I and the others are trying to explain the phenomenon from every possible angle. I was told that the body that arrived today was of a college student. Yeah, uh, the police gave me, uh, some videos and materials for you to look at. What's that? All of this facility is recorded including this office. Are we being monitored? Think of it as like a black box on a plane. Unless the plane goes down, then the box is retrieved. Is that legal? You're working for the US Government now. I have a lot to do. I'll see you later, and maybe we can have lunch. Yes, of course. Okay, bye. DR. MOREIRA: The victims share nothing in common that could help us pinpoint the motive or cause of death. Then we got these videos from police in Montauk. Homelessness... - MAN: You ready? - Huh... oh, yeah, yeah, dude. - Uh, just go ahead and roll. - Okay. Three... two... Homelessness. Often considered to be a symptom of urban blight. But here in the tranquil beaches of Montauk, New York, away from the cities, away from the attractions, we find societies unfortunate citizens finding themselves to be outcasts and alone. while their surroundings may in fact be nicer, their plight is not any easier. My colleagues don't see any relevance, but I... Maybe it's nothing. But it's interesting. Hello, excuse me, sir. Oh, oh, uh, sorry. Look, it's okay. We're shooting a documentary. All right, we just want to ask you a couple questions. Would that be... would that be okay? Um, uh, look. We're, we're terribly sorry to bother you. We just wanna ask you a couple questions. You know, we're just interested in how you got here. How you got in this predicament. They put me here. Who put you here? They took mommy. She was good at numbers, and they left what was left of daddy. They left me on the boat for ten years. But they took and they gave. They gave mommy back, but not to me. They gave me a gift. They gave me a job. But they said I wasn't worthy. They said it was for someone special. My analysis, plus any evidence that comes my way. In this case, the first video is the beginning of a student film. BEN: This project was your idea. I swear, if this film fucks up my class grade, I'm gonna kick your ass. Oh, you're gonna fucking kick my ass, dude? BEN: Just man up and talk to him. Dude, big talk for the guy that's safe behind the fucking camera. You know what? Why don't you try coming on this side talking to the fucking crazy person for once, huh? - BEN: Are you serious? - Yeah, I'm dead serious. - Are you being fucking serious? - Yeah, stop busting my balls and hand over the camera. Or are you all talk, you fucking chickenshit? Could it be a really clever killer who did something to the bodies to make them seem less like homicide? They tell me what to write, and then they tell me to wait. BEN: Good. The teachings are for him. The gift... the gift is for you. For me? Sir, where are you talking...? It was always yours. LUCAS: Oh my God. Ben, stop fucking with this guy, man. I wanna go home. Dude, I wanna get this over with. We're already past deadline. They're in my head. [LAUGHING] Dude, come over here. Check this out. I think there's actually something in here. Like some kind of funky snake. Some kind of natural build up within the victims, brought on by something, a poison, a disease, a parasite. Oh! Ahh! I am their prophet and you're that messenger. For the student found on the beach, the cause of death matches the other cases along the coast. As for the homeless man... The homeless man is still missing, but his book came to us with the videos. My colleagues have no interest in it. [LAUGHING] You think this is funny? [LAUGHING] You think this is funny? There's two people in that video. Now one's dead. Worse than dead, one we can't find, and there's you. Okay, fine. I'll turn this off. Now you got to see how this looks. You and your friend disappear for a week. Now we find him dead on the beach... that's how we found him... and then we find you wondering around the streets. You see? It doesn't look good. Don't you think? - How's it going? - What do you think? Good. [LAUGHS] I need some help here. You gonna help me here? Lucas, are you gonna help me here, okay? We found these books with the body. They were stolen from the New York public library. Any idea why? Big books on, um, history, um, space travel and physics, but we checked and he doesn't study any of those subjects. He's focused on film class just like you are. So why would he steal 'em? POLICE OFFICER: Answer him kid. MICHAELS: Was he on drugs maybe? He was on drugs maybe and he was trying to sell these books and make some quick cash, maybe? Fast cash? Yes, no? Okay, Lucas, we found the video. Okay, we saw the video... found it and we saw it... we do not think that you had anything to do directly with your friend's murder, but you need to help me here, you need to help me here, or I am gonna jam your fuckin' ass up, I'm gonna put you in prison, and you are not gonna do well in prison, Lucas. You're gonna be a piece of chicken in there. They're gonna pass you around like a motherfuckin' tissue paper and blow their noses in you. Is the homeless guy dead, too? Did he attack you and then you killed him in self-defense and then panicked and left the body somewhere? POLICE OFFICER: Speak up, kid. You can't tell me who the other guy in the video is? You can't? Okay, listen, what the fuck is this thing? What's this thing? 'Cause you were holding on it for dear fuckin' life when we jammed your ass up. As far as we can tell, it's the same one - he has in the video. - [MUTTERING] So how did it come to be in your possession? That's hard to explain. That's gonna be a fuckin' jury's ass up, man, and put you in prison. - The book was... - Take a breathe, all right? Relax. Nobody's here to hurt you. You wanna take a break, okay? Take a break? - Take a break. - Take a drink, all right? - Oh, what the fuck. - You're bullshittin' me, right? - Oh, what the... - What the... shit! No, no, no, it's okay. Lucas, it's okay. It's okay, man. Hey, hey, relax. Relax. Okay, come on. You don't wanna do this? You wanna do this? You wanna kill me? Why you do wanna kill me? I've been nice to you. You're safe here. Lucas, you're safe here, okay? We can just forget you even did this. Just give me the gun back. Just give me the gun. Come on, just give it me. Just put it down. Put it on the table and we'll forget about it. - There are voices in my head. - Lucas, look, Lucas. - There are voices in my head! - What? You hear voices? Okay, we'll find you a doctor, we'll get rid of the voices. - There are voices in my head! - [SHOT RINGS OUT] I've done some research about the beach at Montauk, the same area where the police discovered the student's body. The homeless man talked about losing his parents a decade ago. Back then, the Coast Guard came across a small yacht drifting offshore near that beach. Hey, Tommy, come here, buddy. Let me show you how to do this. Be care, that's sharp. Okay, all right. All right, let's, all right. Got it? Jesus. Come here. Be careful, I said. You're gonna poke your eye out. So you wanna put your thumb on this so you don't lose the line. All right, you push this back and let it go out into the water. - What happens if you don't... - So go a head. put, um, put your finger there? Well, it'll go out faster than you want it to - and maybe... - Use all of it. Yeah, use all of it and tangle up... According to the report, the boy claimed his father was killed and his mother abducted, but he was in a state of shock and couldn't provide any details. There you go. Now hold on tight. Here we let it... you gotta... you gotta tease 'em with it a little bit. You know, you have to feel it. You see, the best part of fishing's just being out here and feeling the wind in your hair... feeling the boat move on the water. Look at the view here. - Isn't that cool? - Yeah. Dad? - What is it, buddy? - Look at that. There's nothing. No follow-up reports. No names are given. I hit a dead end. There's a brief mention that the mother was a renowned scientist. There's some speculation that perhaps she was kidnapped. No cause of death for the father is given. There's a note that the boy was hospitalized. Either people aren't talking or the right files didn't survive. The family's identity is a mystery. I can't prove this, but what if the homeless man was the boy on the yacht, grown up? The Coast Guard report does match elements of the homeless man's story. Could he have slipped through the cracks over the years, bouncing from hospital to hospital, until all recorded proof of his existence disappeared? If the boy grew up to be the homeless man, maybe his parents were the first victims of whatever it is. Could the thing in the jug have something to do with all this? She's here now. She already started. We know what to do. Make sure she completes her task. We'll make sure that nothing interferes with this mission. Everything's depending on it. Thank you. So how did your meeting with Jones go? You know, he's a suit. He may be watching this, you know? He's a great guy. You have no idea who's watching this. No idea. Let me tell you something, Johnson. I have seen my share of crazy in my time, classified shit that would make your hair turn white. If the people out there saw what we saw, know what we know, there would be panic in the streets. It's what they don't know that has kept 'em safe. Think about that. But this, this is something else. This... this is the big one. And once Uncle Sam gets his handle on it, germ warfare, special weapons... they'll never fuck with us again, ever. And you and me, Johnson, we were there from the beginning... the day that everything changed. AGENT JOHNSON: We are continuously monitoring the subject. It is my opinion that she seems to have a sense of being watched, and has developed some sort of paranoia of her surroundings. She seems overwhelmed showing signs of fatigue and physical deterioration. I am unable to deduce that this could be the reason Dr. Luiza has been suffering numerous headaches, which appears to be escalating as time passes. These headaches have become noticeably more severe. DR. MOREIRA: The others here at the facility, they are baffled and scared. This epidemic is reaching everyone and no one has a clue, yet. They are dismissing my theories. So what you're suggesting is that we're dealing with some giant prehistoric parasite? Just look at the video with the film student. You can see some kind of large worm leap out of the jug. After that, he ended up at the beach, dead, like the others, like something had forced its way out of his head. I don't know what you think you're seeing in these videos, 'cause there is nothing conclusive showing any worm or anything attacking anyone. There's a black blur. - That's it. - Don't you get it? These worm-like organisms force their hosts toward water. And that's happening with the victims in these cases. They are moving toward water. If I wanna talk to someone about parasites, I have an entire group dedicated to that field. But you? You're supposed to be working on the brain. Here's a thought. Whatever is happening to these people is causing brain damage. So they started doing unexplainable, irrational things. Simple. So you need to stop looking for some bigger conspiracy. The homeless man, crazy or not, may have managed to bury facts in here. It could shed some light on why the student took the book then killed himself. I'll start reading it tonight. It couldn't hurt. AGENT MILLER: High command wants to document our every movement, so keep glasses on record at all times. AGENT JOHNSON: Copy that. The subject is leaving her workplace. Hey. Hey! Do you believe in a Higher Power? What're you talking about, man? Higher Power, man, Greater Good. Something bigger than us. What're you high? 'Cause I could use a pick me up. Whatcha got? - I'm talking about life. - Life? Life. Life with a purpose. I have a purpose. Oh yeah, does it pay money? The rewards are endless. Bigger than money. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. When I was ten, I thought my life was over, man, 'cause they, they took my mom for a grand mission. But now I realize it was, it was an honor, man. I was chosen to usher in the dawn a new world order. Look man, I talk to crazy dudes all the time, but you're sick, man. I know of a free clinic you can go to. What if I told you I can give you anything you want? A better life. A better everything. - I'm listening. - Yeah? What if I told you all you have to do is look in the water. Just in there. Closer. You see it? Whoa. I do see something. But what is it? Everything. Kinda... Touch it. Kinda freaky. I feel. I serve. I shall obey. Thank you so much for volunteering for our new world order. Your time will be beneficial to you and to us. But mostly to us. I did good, didn't I? You're on your way? I'll protect you. DR. MOREIRA: I've been examining this book, well, if you can call it a book. It completely lacks a coherent narrative. It makes no sense. It's just disjointed writing and crude drawings. Yet I've spent days, weeks, going through it. And there's something there, something I can't quite put my finger on. It's like, if you weren't careful enough, just as you were about to see something, you'd lose it. It would be gone and you'd have to start all over again. And that's where I feel like I am now squinting at the pages, on the cusp of something. Then it's gone. But there are some things in here that seem to tie to it all. The all of it. As I examine the pages, I get this sense of déjà vu. And when I look at that image, it makes me think of that thing in the jug. CONNER: Okay, Dr. Jones, ready when you are. Yes, I'm Dr. Vincent Jones. It's 10:35 a.m. March 7th, and I'm here in Autopsy room 3B. Who are these girls? Jane Doe's according to the file. The poor chicks were fine 24 hours ago. They were camping together by the lake. Who found the bodies? The local sheriff. - And where is the sheriff now? - Not sure. He disappeared after the delivery of the bodies. So what else do you know what caused this? Here is the report. You got anything else? We took some CT scans when they were delivered. The scans are over there. There's something in her forehead. - Dr. Jones? - What? - Dr. Jones! - Help me! Get the fuck outta here! Fuck this! Somebody open the door! Open the fucking door! Do we need to contain this situation? Yes, we cannot have this affect or interfere with our primary target. Affirmative. I am on it. Hey! Another video came in. I made sure I got it. My colleagues haven't seen it. They have the bodies... but I don't know if they are ready for this. I'm not sure any of us are ready. You're shooting my ass, aren't you? Huh? Oh, may be. - You are such an idiot. - What? Are you speaking? I can't really focus on you right now. I said that you are going to be sleeping alone tonight. Oh, okay, cool. Keep that up, and I won't let you do the woman job of cleaning all the fish. Hey, we're almost down by the secret spot there. Um, I hate to burst your bubble, Mr. Manly, but your secret spot isn't so secret. What? Let me see. My colleagues are focusing on the bodies, but not the circumstances surrounding their condition and discovery. I begged them to look at the book, at the videos, and they dismiss me. But that hasn't stopped me. Well, what do we have here? Finders keepers, I guess, huh? Hey, maybe we should go somewhere else? I mean, if that guy comes back and sees us messing with his stuff - he might get pissed, you know? - He's not coming back. Look. He left his stuff which is a bit weird because this rod is very expensive. Hey, Ansel Adams, why don't you come here for a close shot, huh? Look at this shit. Maybe he's off in the reeds going to the bathroom. - Can we please leave? - Off in the reeds, babe? Come on, I mean, look. His ice is all melted. - This beer is... - Oh my God. It's warm. He ain't coming back. Okay, Sherlock, now that you've used your CSI skills to give us the time of death on the beer, - can we please go? - All right, come on. - Come on! - No, come on, right now. Let's get outta here, please. Thank you. They found the fisherman. No one reported him missing, but work colleagues said he had taken a week's vacation to go fishing. Uh, he was a really good guy. Uh, very reliable, fun to hang out with. You know, typical everyday guy. I saw him about a week-and-a-half ago, he turned me onto this great new fishing hole. Uh, went there, had a few beers, you know, normal guy stuff. This is it. My new private fishing hole. Don't let the chain fool you. It is perfectly legal to be in here. I don't know what we're gonna catch first, a fish or a buzz, but I guess it really doesn't matter, right? This place is great. I mean, they just found his body, his skull was cracked open... His brains were exposed. I've never seen anything quite like that. Well, why did he leave his things? I mean, it's weird. He was like trying to cook a fish over there. There was bones and shit but there was like worms in the fucking ax. I think we should get the fuck outta here. Look. Someone's coming! What the fuck is the matter with this Guy? Maybe he's hurt, I don't know. Hey, buddy, was that your shit back there? I'm sorry. We just didn't... - Jesus Christ. - What the fuck? Stop! Stop! Stop! What the fuck... When authorities discovered his body, they also discovered the camera and the young man. The young woman from the video, she wasn't found at the scene. She turned up days later. She tried to steal someone's tablet computer. Walked into a coffee shop, saw the tablet sitting on a table, picked it up, walked out. Cops caught her right outside. She didn't resist. She didn't say anything. She still hasn't. When the authorities found out she had been flagged, they brought her here. They just got done fighting over the two corpses. Now there's a feeding frenzy over her. But I think they're wasting their time. The answers aren't in the bodies. They are in the book and the videos. And I think I may have found... a connection. We have reports of the phenomena in every country with shores along the Atlantic. And it's spreading. We had our first U.S. case inland. What happened? Poor bastard, in a supermarket in Buffalo a guy worked in the seafood section. He stabbed his co-worker to death. He was caught at a bus station trying to get to a Syracuse. He offered no resistance, just like the girl. If you let me talk to the girl, I can try to understand what's happening to the victims mentally. I can try to find out what's compelling them to the beach. We're moving the specimen today for tests. No team member is getting near her without protective clothing, because we don't what we're dealing with. I know you've been working hard, but you need to stop with these theories, okay? You need to get something to eat. You need to get some sleep. You need to call your family. You need to... Wait. Are you recording this conversation? - I'm keeping a record... - Are you out of your goddamn mind? Turn that thing off. Turn that thing off and... I've been put on a mandatory leave of absence. I have to leave all files behind... even this. I feel like I'm getting closer to the truth. Good afternoon, this is Ann Davis for News 7 your local news and here are our top stories for today. Six bodies were found this morning at North Bay Beach in an apparent mass murder. According to the police, the identities of these victims have not been disclosed as the brutality of these murders have made some of the victims unidentifiable. According to the medical examiner the victims heads seem to have exploded. This murder scene resembles various other murders that have come across the news in recent weeks. The police are investigating any and all connections, and we will continue to report any updates here on News 7 as they come available. In unrelated news, two individuals believed to be a man and a woman robbed the First National Bank on Oak Street earlier today getting away with hundreds of thousands of dollars. Local police are asking for any information on these suspects to call the police hotline and do not approach these individuals as they may be armed and dangerous. [SCREECHING] Is it rolling, Blake? Yeah, it's rolling. It's our money now, bitches! Did you see them freak? I thought the bank teller was gonna shit themselves! And the lady, when I stole her diamonds. Fuck. Yeah, we take from the bank and the customers for little old us. No doubt. - We're fucking bad asses. - Holy shit. Holy shit. - Babe, check this out. - Blake, get the camera. - Get the camera. I wanna get a close up. - All right, I'll get it. Oh my God. Oh my God. Doesn't this look pretty on me? You sexy bitch. Oh my God, Blake. There's so much money. Oh, wow. Oh my God. All right, put the camera down. I want you to do me on top of all this money. You are a crazy bitch. I fuckin' love you. We're gonna go into the marina and we're gonna steal a boat and go wherever the fuck we want. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Who the fuck is that? SHERIFF WILLIAMS: Open the door! Open the door! Let me in! BLAKE: What you want, motherfucker! It's Sheriff fuckin' Williams. Let me in! There's some fuckin' crazy people out here! Let me fuckin' in! Open the fuckin' door! Oh my God. I got a gun. Blake, who is it? I think it's the cops. - Let's get the fuck outta here. - Relax, baby, I got this. What the fuck? Hey come on, we gotta get the fuck outta here. Come on, get dressed. Give me the fuckin' gun. - Get all the money. - Leave the rest, come on. Come on, grab the bag. Stay behind me. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - Shoot 'em! Shoot 'em! - No! I can't get the others to study the book. They won't watch and examine the videos. They will probably file this all away as soon as I leave. Maybe that's the biggest irony. This was written by a madman. And he may have been the sanest of us all. He was the only one capable of trying to make us understand what was out there. What if we're not dealing with some mindless parasite turning hosts into brainless zombies? What if we're facing an intelligence? What if the man knew for years what was coming? He called himself a prophet. Maybe that is what he was. Maybe he was trying to recruit the student to carry on or help with his work. A messenger of sorts. Could Lucas have had an inkling of what fate was in store for him? Shooting himself might have been the wisest course of action. But why? What knowledge drove him to that? Could it be... Why are you filming this? WILL: So the police will know what happened. We're not murderers, Julie. Nobody's killing anybody, okay? I just need to talk to him. That's all. Hey, it's gonna be okay. Her husband and all these people, these were people we knew, they went down by the river, and they started acting weird. We didn't really wanna talk about what we were gonna do. We just knew it was gonna get ugly. WILL: Julie, stay close. I'm gonna talk with him, Will. - Julie! - Julie! Julie! - Wait! - Hey! Listen! - We can't be alone! - We stay together! Stick with the plan, you understand me? Anything bad happens, I'm just gonna start shooting. WILL: Yeah, let's hope it doesn't come to that, huh? Okay. Nick, it's me. Please look at me. Nick, come home. I got you. Nick, please look at me. Nick, come home with me! WILL: Julie. Julie, step away from him. That is not Nick. - What're we gonna do? - I don't know! Just stay calm and be quiet! What the fuck is this? I don't know. Just keep your eyes on 'em. Hey, I got a real clear shot. WILL: No, not with Julie there. - Will! - Yeah? There's something in the water! WILL: You can see it in the video. I didn't get the best shot of it, but it's big, dark, cloudy... and it's just sort of writhing around. Julie, get away from him! Run! Get to the truck! Let's go! Come on! So... I made it to the truck. I'm the only one. It was like one big hivemind serving that thing... whatever it is. But I saw it... we saw it... and it's on the video. I don't know what that thing in the water was, but whatever it is... God have mercy our soul. AGENT MILLER: Subject returning to the workplace. Situation normal. What about the casualties? Or The Specimen? They're not the mission. Staying on target. The patient... the specimen... whatever you want to call her... escaped. No one could have guessed she was capable of violence. She sent two to the hospital, killed two more. My supervisor... was among the dead. So it turns out... I'm not going on mandatory leave... after all. He never got a chance to put in the paperwork. [NO AUDIO] The few remaining team members are debating how she did it. You sound like a bunch of pregnant fuckin' bitches! You're fucking crying about this and this! Frank's fucking dead! Huh? HUH? If we're dealing with an organism that burrows into the brain to control the host, maybe it can also turn off pain. That the Specimen may have been reaching for my laptop. She was skimming NASA pages, sites of space travel and theory, reading the biography pages for astronauts and astrophysicists. She wanted addresses and locations. What was she after? Who was she after? Was it all just random? I haven't spoken to my family in ages. I have a husband and a daughter. It's been so long. Ahh! Trying to scare me? You think you're funny? - Play with the baby stick. - Give me the stick. - No. - Give... No. Whoa. Mom, I think I'm getting a little big for the swing set. DR. MOREIRA: I close my eyes to remember their faces. And I hope they remember mine. I can't remember the last time I slept. I can't take the nightmares. They're the kind that wake you up in a cold sweat, leaving you wondering where you are, how you got there, not knowing whether the dream was the true reality you just snapped out of. But there is this déjà vu nagging at me. But it leaves the impression of somewhere and something wet and cold and old... Somewhere and something familiar. And it's coming from darkness. And I'm waiting for it. It's waiting for me. [OVERLAPPING WHISPERING VOICES] [WOMEN LAUGHING] And then he said, "Where is the toast?" Hell's coming! Shit! This will be my last entry. I don't say that to be melodramatic. The word came down. The military is coming to take over everything. I don't know what they expect to find. I guess they are as desperate as I am. My colleagues, what few were left, are gone. They gave up, retreated. They don't know what they're dealing with. They just know it's winning. So I'm alone here. Which is a cruel twist. Because I finally have what I was looking for. And there is no one to show it to. Not that it matters. They still wouldn't believe me. I doubt the military will be any more open-minded. Let's get the hell out of here. They still wouldn't believe me. I'll be gone before the soldiers roll in. They can have this place. They should rot here. I'm going to my family. I'm, I'm going home. But I need to show this first. Yo, check it out. - What? - What? Dude, I don't like... whoa, I don't like this. What? Why am I stopping? It's a chick. - Oh, of course. - Hey. You okay? Where're you headed? I think I hear him speak. Location home. - Uh, we can give you a ride. - No! No, I'm sorry. We can't... are you fucking kidding? Hey come on, come on. Don't be such a little bitch. We're going to the beach. Are my words in right? Am I meaning there, too? - Home please. - Whoa, whoa, crazy lady! No man, she needs to go to a hospital. Nah, she just needs a beer. I'm not fucking around! Well, look. Tell me this girl doesn't like to party. She's all coked up. Maybe she has something on her. Check her. - Guys, this is not cool. - No fucking way. I am not checking her. She stinks. Don't be such a pussy. She's passed out. Who cares what she smells like. You know you'll bang her if you get the chance. I hear you and someone understands me. Okay, asshole. Somebody just give me a tissue please. - What the fuck are you doing? - What? What do you mean what? Look at her. She could barely walk. Look, I swear to God. - If you guys do anything to her. - Seriously. - What's your fucking problem? - What's my problem? Hey, look at me. Jail. Jail's my fucking problem, man. Look, you don't get it, do you? She's in no condition. And if you do anything to her, anything at all and she reports it to the cops, - you're fucked. - When did you become such a fag? Uh, fuck you. Nah, I'm outta here. Whoa. Where the fuck are you going? - Anywhere but here. - Here motherfucker. Yeah, you're walking. Fuck you. Shit. Waves. [SPEAKING INCOHERENTLY] This is gonna be awesome. She's so fucked up. Are you ready not to wait? I'm ready for whatever. The boy she had kissed was gone. Dude, what's wrong? What the fuck? Oh God. What the fuck did you do to him? You fucking whore! The other boy, the boy who was filming was lying there on the beach, clutching the camera. He was alive... but he was institutionalized. I was able to find out where from the authorities who sent me the video. They told me that he hasn't spoken a single word since being found on the beach. So I asked questions about him and his treatment. They told me he just sits alone all day and draws odd pictures and shapes. They think it's all meaningless but they also see it as therapeutic. I asked if I could see some of his drawings. And they sent me this. A homeless man. A teenager. They never met. They had no mutual acquaintances. They lived near the Atlantic Ocean, but hundreds of miles apart. How is that they both drew the same thing? But I don't believe it, and I don't care anymore. I don't care. The nightmares are worse. Even when I don't sleep, there isn't any escape. Oh my God! I just want to go home. I'm going home. Hey, stop where you are! - Put that down. - I need to get out of here. - I said put that down! - Easy, Johnson. Johnson, stand down. She should just surrender. You need to come with us now. - I need to get out. - Negative. The facility's in lockdown. No need to worry. We're debriefing all remaining staff, and collecting all research. I have to get home to my daughter. Hand those documents over now and come with us. I'm not finished with it. We can't risk anything getting out of this facility. What? You can't do this. I'm afraid I don't have any choice. Orders. Johnson, Rodriquez, secure anyone you find. Will do. Reinforcements should be here shortly. Yes, sir. DR. MOREIRA: Are they dead? He definitely is. They are, too. Are you all right, huh? You're the detective from the video. You're the one who sent us this. - Yeah. - We need to get out of here. Did you hear everything I said? Did you hear what the guy said? Reinforcements are coming. I'd be a death sentence to go that way anyway. So is there another exit? Yeah? Is it nearby? Yeah? You're free to go. But first, you gotta give me that book, okay? What? You gotta give me that book, okay? - What? - The book. It's been haunting me. I'm hearing voices. They were soft at first, but now they're getting louder and more insistent. That book called me here. It's found this fuckin' place. I hear the voices, too. No, you don't. You're full of shit. You do not. That book had called me here to serve it, to protect it or something. But I say, fuck it. I'm here to destroy it. No. I tried. You can't. What? Hey, look. I don't wanna argue with you, and, frankly, I don't have the fuckin' time. All right, but my life has been fucked up ever since that book came into it. And so it's gonna end right here, right now. It's too valuable to destroy. - What do you mean? - I've been studying this. Whatever's going on, this book is the key to understanding it. Maybe even stopping it. Really? If you're saying to me, I mean, are you saying to me, that that book, this book here... will make it better? [EMERGENCY SIGNAL SOUNDING] All right. Okay, listen. You take it and you will leave and you will sneak out of here and you're clever, and you get the fuck away and you live. You understand me? You live. All right? You can go. - You're not coming? - No, I'm not. I'm gonna stay and buy you some time. Handle these guys with their guns, okay? I understand that shit. That's what I'm good at. It's normal to me. Okay, that shit outside, whatever's going on out there, we're going to hell anyway, right? We won't need to. Hell is coming to us. Go! - AGENT JOHNSON: Do you wanna try to stop her? - AGENT MILLER: Negative. She's finally leading us to the Higher Intelligence. AGENT JOHNSON: Yeah, but you know what's gonna happen when she goes home. AGENT MILLER: Our task is to observe and report. End of conversation. And here we have dad who thinks he's a 19-year-old college sophomore. What do you want? I wanna know why you have a mid-life crisis mobile. I don't have a mid-life crisis mobile, okay? It's, it's good on gas and it gets me around. And it makes you look like a kid. What do you want? I think you're trying to impress the neighbor. Go... play in traffic or something. - [POUNDING ON DOOR] - My name is Daniela Belea. I live on Maple Lane - Middleton, New Jersey. - Uh, what is that? I don't know, Dad. There's some crazy lady banging on the door. - What are you doing? - I'm filming it in case we have to show the cops. - Cops? Hello? - Grab your things! - Can I help... - Grab your things! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - We need to go! - What're you doing? - It's all in here, but there's no time to explain! We need to head west. You need to get out of my house right now! Your house? What do you mean? Ma'am, I don't know if you're high or if you're crazy or if you're drunk, but you need to leave right now! It's our house. It's me. Why are acting like you don't know me? Because I don't, I don't. - You do. - No, look, I have seen... - You do know me. It's me. - No, I don't. I've seen you around the neighborhood jogging before, yes, but I don't know your name, I don't know where you're from. Now if you do not leave right now, - I am calling the police. - What? What are you talking about? It's me, sweetie. I'm your wife. What's wrong with you? - Dad. - Pumpkin? - It's me. It's Mommy. - Dad! What's wrong with you? Okay, I'm a widower. My wife... her mom... died five years ago, okay? DR. MOREIRA: Oh, no, that can't be. ROGER: You need to leave right now or I'm calling the police. - I don't know, I think she's high or... - I don't want to do this. - Please. - Get back. Get back. Miss, Miss. She's bleeding. Miss, let me help you, okay, let me call you an ambulance. - Run! - Let me get you some help. - Please. - Before it's too late. - Let me help you. - Run. [SCREAMING] I need your phone. AGENT MILLER: Now the real work begins. What have I done? If that is not my family, so who are they? Where's my home? I just keep hearing it, home, home. Get out of my head! Shut up. Where's my house? It needs to be over here somewhere. I know I live over here. Where's my home? I hear it. I hear home, home, home. My home. - Home. - SEA ZOMBIE: Home. Home. Messiah has come. ALL: Reveal the One Who Walks Beyond. - Home. - ALL: Home. - Home. - ALL: Home. - Home. - ALL: Home. - Home. - ALL: Home. - Home. - ALL: Home. - Home. - ALL: Home. [SHOT RINGS OUT] [SHOT RINGS OUT] Hey! Get up here! I got a truck. This place is crawling with these things! I can get us to safety. Come on. Hey. I'm not crazy. I've seen that thing with my own two eyes. I can help. Obstacle defeated. Subject free to continue. I'm sorry for your loss, but I'm gonna need to ask you a few questions. So if you could just help me out. I'm trying to understand what happened to you today. Excuse me please. - No sir. - No! No! Jesus, get him off me! DR. MOREIRA: Wait. Don't go. You... I recognize you. I do. Your the one who gave the two students this. I knew you before that. What? Mommy. What? What did you call me? Mommy? They wouldn't let you keep me. They did what they had to do and then they released you. And people said that you had lost your way, - but I knew it wasn't true. - Why are you doing that to me? They came in the boat. And they killed daddy. And they took you. Oh my God. Oh my God. I can believe... Oh, no. They made me their prophet. They made you their messiah. The chose you. I never wanted that. Please. You never wanted that? Kill me. Please kill me. You never wanted that. No, I want you. I wanted you. You don't want me! - I love you. - You don't want me! I didn't have any control. I want you. I love you. They're in my head, mommy. They're in my head, mommy. - I love you. - For years. Baby, I know. I know, baby. I know. They chose you. - I was weak. - They chose you. And now your job is done. - Come with me. - It's too late. Come with me please. It's too late. Mommy, it's too late. It's not too late. - It's too late. - It's not too late. Please. [SOBBING] It's too late. - No! - It's too late! No, it's not, it's not! You come with me! Please come with me. Please don't do this. This is it. Finally what we came here for. Stay focused. Miller, this situation is out of control and dangerous. Johnson, I'm calling it in. Headquarters is ready to send military backup on my word. Stay focused. She is the key to the source. She's always been the key. Yeah well, I don't think she's here alone. Johnson! What do you think you're doing? AGENT MILLER: Look, we don't want any trouble. Just in the wrong place. That's it. Just tell your creatures to let us go. I don't think so. I think you're after my mom. I think the CIA has been tracking our every move. AGENT JOHNSON: We know what's you're going to do, - and we're gonna stop it. - You don't know shit. And anyways, it's too late. You're the boy from the boat. Hey, we're trying to find you. We tried to help you. You did? I was underground. Not all of our followers survived. But the ones that did... are loyal. They're loyal to me, to my mom... to the master. DR. MOREIRA: I know now the real reason why the government hired me. They knew I had a connection to the master. After the boat accident, I lost most of my memories especially of my real husband and my son. My son didn't get the title right. The seas from whence they came? That's wrong. There's no "they." There's only "it." And it's not from the seas. The seas are where it is now, but that's not where it comes from. It comes from somewhere else. It doesn't belong here. It doesn't want to be here. It was ripped from a place we'll never know. A place we'll never understand. It was here before all of us. I'm not a prophet. I'm the messiah. It is part of me equally. We are separate and one. It can force me to understand, and that's how I know exactly what it is and exactly what it wants. It's just a new beginning. A new end. The wait is over. Its time is now. I'm the messiah chosen to show you what's coming. I wanted to go home. And it wants to go home, too. And only one of us will get to do that now. [SCREECHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Wait a minute.
