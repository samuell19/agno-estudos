Subtitles by explosiveskull I'm honoured to be here today to celebrate the life of a great man... a great husband and a great father. The releasing of these ashes into the sea represents a return to home. Life and death is a great mystery. We are summoned to this world, and then... called upon to return, God's vast plan and purpose so deep that our understanding fails... and our reason cannot follow. Sean, would you like to say a few words? I didn't prepare anything. ♪♪ Summer rain, won't you come to me? ♪ ♪ This man needs your sympathy ♪ ♪ And wash over me ♪ ♪ And wash over me ♪ ♪ I swear I ain't a criminal ♪ ♪ Just a man who needs a miracle ♪ ♪ Swing low for me ♪ ♪ Swing low for me ♪ ♪ 'Cause I've been to hell ♪ ♪ And I lived to tell ♪ ♪ That I ain't going back ♪ ♪ No, I ain't going back ♪ ♪ The devil's gonna chase me ♪ ♪ 'Cause I ain't going quietly ♪ ♪ I'm gonna tire him out ♪ ♪ I'm gonna run him out ♪ ♪ I hear the train coming ♪ ♪ I'm heading back to the station ♪ ♪ It's my ticket home ♪ ♪ It's my ticket home ♪ ♪ This man needs your sympathy ♪♪ What's up, my man? Can I help you? Hey! No, I'm OK. Thanks. Hi! Does Henry Barnes live here? He used to. Who's asking? My name's Sean. OK. Uh, see, I... Um, how do you know my stepfather? We... we're old friends. Old friends? Yeah. Um... Do you know where he lives now? He's out of town right now. I'm guessing he'll be back to LA in a couple days. You can see him then. All right. Well... - Hey! Scott, was it? - Sean. Are you nervous? You look like you could use a glass or two of water. OK. How do I say this? I'm not an old friend of his. I've never even met him before. I found this letter on my car windshield yesterday when I was on the way back from my father's funeral. - Your father's funeral? - Yeah. The letter was written anonymously, but as you can see, I have this address and I have a name. Apparently, your stepdad is also my half-brother. That's pretty insane! Tell me about it. I don't know what the hell to believe or who could have written the letter. What can you tell me about him? Henry? He was a writer. Um... He even wrote a book that got published. But then he fell into some hard times, and he hasn't really written anything since. Listen, he's a drunk. He's a criminal. And he's definitely not to be trusted. And... he's a murderer. What? He killed a woman. There was a trial, but he got off. If you get involved with him, I can promise you this: You're gonna be dragged down into a world you don't wanna go anywhere near. This is a lot of information to process at one time. I should, uh, get going. Oh yeah? OK. Uh, well, it was nice meeting you. - You too. - Uh-huh. - Yeah. - All right. ♪♪ Until my dying days ♪ ♪ Until I can't recall my own name ♪ ♪ I'll love you until the Reaper comes to call ♪ ♪ Till the memories fade and our faces start to fall ♪ ♪ When the secrets come out ♪ ♪ The tide washes away them all ♪ ♪ Until my dying days ♪ ♪ Until I can't recall my own name ♪ ♪ When the secrets come out ♪ ♪ The tide washes away them all ♪♪ He's got a fruit stand on a street corner somewhere downtown. A fruit stand? I'd never have guessed. How could you have? What kind of fruit? Um, I think he deals exclusively in mangoes, but I could be wrong. I'm just curious: Why did you tell me he was out of town yesterday? I was hoping I could convince you not to meet him. But if you're dead set on finding your long lost, evil brother, I guess I'll help you out. - Thanks. - Don't mention it. Is this your car? Yeah. She's a pretty sweet ride, isn't she? From what you told me about him, I can't picture him working at a fruit stand. Well, it's not your average fruit stand. "Mango" is a code word for meth. What do you mean? I mean he uses the fruit stand as a cover for his drug sales. - Drug sales? - Yeah, Henry's a drug lord. - What? - I thought I told you this! No! Oh! Well, I did say he was dangerous, didn't I? You still want to meet him? Yeah. It's your funeral. OK, I think he used to work that corner right there, but I guess he recently moved. So, how do we find him? Well, he's got about 5 different locales that he circles between, so eventually, we should find him. I gotta warn you, though: Once we get close to Henry's turf, things might get a little crazy, OK? Why? Because he's a drug lord. Oh, shit! What's going on? Don't turn around. There's a guy behind us in a red car. It's Henry's ex-partner, and he owes him a shit ton of money. This guy will go after anyone close to Henry to get it. - Bloody hell! - Bloody hell is right. OK, I'm pretty sure he's ID'd me. You need to get down. - Are you serious? - Yes, I'm serious! Get down. I don't want him to ID you too! How much money does Henry owe? Enough to sleep with one eye open. Now you think this thug ex-partner guy is after you? Well, yeah, that's what thugs do! They come after you. Ah... OK, hold on to your tea and biscuits. I gotta lose this guy. - Oh, for goodness' sake! - Didn't I tell you to get down? Stop looking back. They'll ID you! They? You said one ex-partner thug guy. These assholes always travel in pairs. Watch out! Ah! Why are you driving on the sidewalk right now? Watch out for this guy! - Don't worry, I got this. - Ah! Whoa! I feel like I'm in The French Connection right now. The French what? Whoa! Be careful! Stop talking and duck your head down. OK, OK! You can come up now. - Are you OK? - Yeah, I'm fine. You're a sensational driver. Well, thank you. Mmm... Hey... Have you ever been in love? Yes. You? Yes. Tell me a secret, something nobody else knows. A secret? Hmm. Um... - I... - OK, fine. I'll go. I'm killing myself two weeks from today. What? I'm serious. You're not happy? Happiness has nothing to do with it. Why are you telling me this? I don't know. I figured I should tell someone. Why would you do that? Why do you care, anyway? Because I have a conscience. Is that the only reason you care? So, we're just supposed to hang out for the next two weeks until you kill yourself? I never said I wanted to spend the last two weeks of my life with you. Oh. I'm kidding. Come up. You still owe me a secret. ♪ Your turn ♪ My turn for what? ♪ I told you I was gonna kill myself ♪ ♪ So now it's your turn ♪ All right. OK. Let me see if I can beat your secret. My whole life is a lie. I've always had it all planned out. I could see it all in front of me. And now, I don't know what that is anymore. ♪ Why do you lie so much? ♪ Hmm? I've never been in love. ♪ Everyone has been in love ♪ ♪ At least once ♪ I've been in relationships, and I've said the words... but I've never really meant them. Not really. Hmm. ♪ Come outside and have a smoke with me ♪ ♪ I have something to tell you ♪ The main thing you need to know about Henry is he was abandoned by his father, your father. And you know who he was left with? His alcoholic mother. She abused the shit out of him when he was a kid, OK? Horrible things went down. He never got to meet your dad, and now, he'll never get a chance to. But he still fucking hates him. You know who he hates even more? - Who? - You. Well, how do you figure that? Your father left him with his fucked-up mother so he could start his new family. You're everything he could have been. You tell him you're his half-brother, and he'll kill you. How do you even know that he's guilty, though? I mean, he got off. Why are you so sure that he killed that woman? Well... ...because that woman was my mother. Here's your smoke. If you ever see that man, I don't want to have anything to do with you. I didn't know. I... I'm really sorry. It's OK. What makes you so certain that he killed your mother? Get out! What? Now! I didn't mean to upset you, though. Apology accepted. Now please leave! - Sean, out! - OK! Go! - Hi. - Hi. - Can I come in? - No! I need to talk to you. Well, talk. OK. Um... I don't know how to say this, other than... can we start over? What I said, questioning you about Henry... and your mother... I had no right. I don't need to see him. I'd much rather continue to see you... if that's all right. That would be nice. I want to take you out. - Like, on a date? - Yeah. Any place in mind you'd like to go? - What are we doing here? - I need a new dildo. Cool! All right. Um, you got a lot of choice. This looks like a cactus. Can I help you with anything? Oh, no. No, no. We're good. We're just looking around. Actually, I'm looking for a new vibrator. Do you have any that you would recommend? We have a wide range of dildos and vibrators, and, of course, vibrating dildos. Vibrators, we have all your standards: your egg-shaped, your wand, your bullet, etc., both battery operated and rechargeable. Uh, we have your dual stimulation to get the Z-spot and the G-spot simultaneously. We have ticklers. We have some anal beads, butt plugs and, oh, cock rings. Oh, we'd like to know how those work. Absolutely! Let me show you. - This is your cock ring. - Mm-hmm. So, when you bring in your penis, you can wear this at different points to get different kinds of stimulation. If you place it at the tip, that's a good place to start. Now, if you want some more testicular sensation, just move this on down to the bottom, and there, the vibrations go into the balls. Wow! Yeah. That's really fascinating. - Thank you so much! - Absolutely! Um. I think I'll get this one. Great choice! I'll ring you up at the register whenever you're ready. And we have lots of lube as well, if you're interested. - Oh, perfect! - Yeah! - Thank you. - Thank you. How often do you masturbate? I can't answer that. I'm a lady. Hmm! Mmm... Thank you. Did you hate waking up in the morning to work there? He fell off a roof while laying brick on some rich guy's house in Beverly Hills. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

I know I sort of peer-pressured you into that one. It's OK. But you do owe me now, so be aware. Well, how can I ever repay you? Well, I don't know yet. Well, uh, I do have a few great natural talents. Oh! One of them is that I give an incredible foot massage. - Hmm! - It's a gift. OK, then. Let's test your skills. OK... Come on, we're waiting, my feet and I. OK. You look so nervous! What? I thought you were good at this. I am! Oh my god! They're incredibly cute feet. Maybe the cutest I've ever seen. OK. Thanks, I guess. Sean... Mm-hmm? You're kind of terrible at this. I know. I just really wanted to touch your feet. You can keep massaging my feet, but, um, you're not gonna kiss me or sleep with me tonight. Oh, that's good, that's good. I didn't want to kiss you or sleep with you tonight. - Oh. - Mm-hmm. Hmm. ♪♪ Tell me, baby, do you like the way I move? ♪ ♪ Come on, get your dance on ♪ ♪ We can have as much fun as you can possibly have ♪ ♪ With your pants on ♪♪ Let me walk you to your front door.

Yes, minus that. So... What do you want to do now? Looks like we both lied. You also said you didn't want to sleep with me. I'm in a lying kind of mood right now. I only lie once per day. Siren Seduction by Henry Barnes... Hmm... "The sight of her heaving bosoms "caused a torture inside him he prayed would never end. "She emerged from the water, "her golden locks wrapped around her body "like a mermaid drenched in seaweed. "She beckoned to him with her piercing blue gaze, "and he could feel himself being pulled into the sparkling abyss. "He was powerless against her seduction. "Could he help it if he wanted her? "After all, they weren't related by blood. "Could he admit it, even to himself, "that he was falling helplessly in love... "with his daughter?" Excuse me. Are you Henry Barnes? Depends what mood I'm in. Who's asking? I'm looking to write an article on you. Look, if this is about the trial, a court of law saw fit to let me go. I don't do interviews. It wouldn't be about the trial. Honestly, I don't know anything about that, really. Um, I'd be more interested in what you've been doing since. I really liked your novel. You read my book? Yes. It's really, um... Hey, Chris! How's it going, man? All right. - The usual? - Yep! Got something for you. You got something for me? Yeah, man. You should come by, have some mango. It was really fascinating. What did you like about it? How real it felt, the characters. You're my one fan. I'm sure that's not true. Shouldn't you be in school or something? What are you, 16? I'm 24. I remember when I was 24. It all seemed to make sense. My whole life ahead of me, my whole fucking life. What are you doing? I'm just taking down a few notes for the article. How'd you find out I was here? Um, I just got told that you worked on a fruit stand on a street corner in downtown. So I took my chances. I started walking around, hoping I'd find you, and, um, here you are! So, uh... you gonna buy some mangoes or what? I'm OK, thanks. You don't like mangoes? They're OK. I think you should lay down some cash and have one of these delicious treats. Fresh off the boat. Sure, OK. - I'll... I'll have one. - Hmm. Does... does that cover it? What else you got in there? That'll do. Here. Eat one. Hmm? Put it in. Chew it. Slower. Mm-hmm. - Bag of mangoes, please. - Yeah. - The mangoes fresh? - Absolutely! How much for a bag? - $2. Just mangoes? - Just mangoes. - You got a sweet tooth? - Yeah. All right. Enjoy! Stay healthy. Did you, um... Did you remarry? You think I killed her, don't you? No, I don't. I don't know anything about it. But you read about it. Yeah, a little. So, you want to interview me, and you don't want to talk about that? You said you didn't want to talk about that. You fucking with me, kid? No, I swear! I didn't do it. OK. Hey! Hi! What have you been up to? Oh, a little bit of this, a little bit of that. What are you doing? Cigarettes and laundry. - Sounds like fun. - Tons. Can I join you? Yes, you shall. Why do laundry if you're gonna just end it all in a few weeks? I'm civilized, and I like clean stuff. Don't you have a mother back home who's worried about you? She's always worried about me. Have you told her about what your father did, that you have a half-brother? I don't know if it's anything she even needs to know. It would crush her. She... she loved my father very much. She respected him. She ever tell you that, that she loves and respects him? She was in love with him. Well, love is a tricky thing. It can be pretty deceiving. You never wonder? Wonder what? Well, if it was real or not. Well, I've been trying to go through these moments in my head, images of my parents, um... things my father said to me through the years, things he's said to my mother. And my mom can't ever know about this. Shouldn't she know the truth about him? Sometimes, it's better not to know. Could you see yourself being married to the same person... for, like, 30, 40, 50 years? So daunting to think about it. I can picture it. I just, um... can't imagine being in a marriage with someone I wasn't madly in love with. Could you hand me my thong? It dropped next to your leg. Kate... Yeah? If you fell in love with someone... madly in love with someone... would that make life worth living more? So, you're saying if I met this man and fell deeply, madly, passionately in love with him in the next week and a half, would I decide not to kill myself? Yes. I'd take him with me. You coming here has shaken me up a bit. But I am glad you decided to stay instead of going behind my back and tracking down my mother's killer. Me too. You again? I have a, uh... I have a few more questions for you, if you're not gonna mind. Hey, man, why should I mind? All I got is time! You want a taste? I do! - Oh, that's good! - Mm-hmm. Um, I do have a few questions about your family. Do they live around here? Family. Let's see... Oh, right, for your article. Yeah. Getting personal now, are we? I haven't seen my mother since I was 17, and, uh, I never had the pleasure of being introduced to the old man. I'm sorry to hear that. Sorry? About what? That you never got to know your father. I'm not! And your mother? Why... why haven't you seen her? She used to do the beauty-pageant circuit when she was a teenager. She was a troubled woman later in life, something wrong in her brain. I feel sorry for her, actually. Right. Do you have any siblings? Nope. Do you talk to Kate anymore? You've really done your homework. I haven't seen her in a long time. How come? You know how these things are. Yeah. Well, um, don't you miss her? Yeah, sometimes, when I'm lying in bed late at night. She gave me the best head I've ever had. You wouldn't fucking believe it! Hey! How was your morning? - Oh, fine. - Mmm. What are you up to? I'm gonna take a shower. You want to join me? ♪♪ I know you, brother ♪ ♪ You've been taking ♪ ♪ I know you, sister ♪ ♪ You're trying to make it for love ♪ ♪ How do you feel now? ♪♪ Kate, we need to talk. ♪♪ Sean, come take a shower with me ♪ ♪ Get in here Get in here ♪ ♪ Get in here ♪♪ Hmm. Oh! You have, um, really good water pressure. That's what you're thinking about right now? Mm-hmm. Amongst other things. What did you want to talk about? - What's the matter? - Nothing. Why did you stop? I'm just a little bit nervous. That's all. Don't worry so much. Oh... Are you serious? Hmm. How about I wash your hair or something? How about you get the fuck out of my shower? What? What the fuck? Hey, no, wait! Wait! Can we talk? No! But I need to talk to you. - Don't touch me! - I'm sorry. Get out of my house! - Please! - Go! Get the fuck out! - Fine! - Wait! - What? - Drop the towel. - Are you serious? - It's my favourite towel. You are one crazy... I'm not letting you in. I don't want to come in. I'm glad I didn't go and see Henry. I think if I ever met him, I... I would kill him. I'm gonna go change. I'll be here, waiting patiently for you to return. "Birds Do the Strangest Things." Oh! Uh... Oh... Whoa! - Hey! - Yeah, hey! Hey. I need a smoke. OK. Want me to roll you one? Uh, sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey... Hmm? What's wrong with you? Nothing. Nothing's wrong. Mmm... No, I'm just, um... I was just thinking about that letter, you know. Mmm. Like, who the hell could have written it? Do you have, um... Do you have any idea? No. I have no idea. I mean, your guess is as good as mine. Hey, I'm hungry! Let's go get some food. - So, Kate... - Hmm? Look, I need to ask you something... Hey. I wrote the letter. You may never want to see me again, and I'll understand that. So, what? This whole thing's been a lie? Just let me explain, OK? Well, tell me! Enlighten me into your psyche. - OK, I'm... - The truth. - Yes, of course. - No more lies. No more lies. I wrote you the letter because I wanted to lure you over here and seduce you into falling in love with me so I could convince you to kill him, to kill Henry. What does that even mean? What are you telling me? I thought that if you fell for me and you knew that he murdered my mother, you'd want to help me get revenge. Do you know how crazy that sounds? Well, now that I'm the one falling for you, I can't go through with it, so... You are? You're... Falling for you? Completely. This doesn't make any sense. Why would you write me a letter and lure me down here, but when I get down here, you convince me not to see him? Henry's a very convincing guy. I knew if you met him, he would... You know, you wouldn't believe me. Oh, I should believe you now? Yes. OK, but why me? Why not get someone else to kill him? - Motive. - Why would I have a motive? Your recently deceased father was having an affair and had a secret family. You'd have motive to want to kill the child that was a result of that affair. I can't fucking believe that you wanted me to kill him, or anyone for that matter. That man fucking killed my mother! - Yeah, I know. But... - But what? It doesn't mean you have the right to murder him. I mean, OK, he might have deserved it. And if that was my mother, I might want to do the same. So, what are you saying? If you're so set on killing yourself, why wouldn't you just kill him? Believe me, that was my first instinct, to just kill that asshole myself. But, on the off chance that I got caught, I wouldn't be able to execute my suicide as planned. Oh, fuck! You're insane. I just want what he has coming to him. - I'm gonna go. - Hey, don't go! Well, I'm going. I need to figure shit out. Please, I'm sorry. I... I didn't mean to lie to you.

Hey... I was thinking about what you said, about wanting me to kill Henry. What about it? I want to do it. What? Henry murdered your mother. The guy deserves it. He deserves to die, and I want to do it. I want to do it for you. Are you fucking with me? No, I'm totally serious. OK, well, why the change? Don't you agree it's insane? I mean, you're a lot of things, but you're not a killer. Yeah, you're right, I'm not a killer, but I've also never felt this way about anyone before. People change. People do crazy things, things they never could have imagined doing. This is what you wanted, right? It's what you were planning. Yeah, but... Well, let's just stick to the plan. It was a crazy plan. Well, I'm in a crazy kind of mood. You're being ridiculous. You don't think I'm capable of going through with it. I'm not saying that. I just don't know if... You'll get caught. I've got this. So, how are you gonna do it exactly? Shoot him. - Shoot him? - Yeah. You know, with a gun. Well, do you even have a gun? No, I need to go buy one. OK, sure. Go get a gun and shoot him. Hey, I'm offering up my services. I... You're crazy. Blah! I'm fucking crazy! I'm a fucking nutter! And I'm gonna do it. Where did you get a gun? From a shady gun dealer guy. He even threw in some free bullets. Now I just need to figure out how to execute the perfect murder. Sean, have you ever even shot a gun? How hard could it be? This guy said this is really easy to handle. It's just a point and a shoot type of deal. I thought about using a blade, but that would be too messy. You're not serious? This is crazy! No. I'm willing to do anything for you. OK. You know... I'm pretty impressed you actually went out and bought a gun. It's kind of bad-ass. Well, you're bringing it out of me. So, what's the plan? Well, I've come up with something totally elaborate and genius. Mm-hmm. I'm gonna follow him. And then I'll corner him in a hidden alley somewhere nearby. And then I'll shoot him in the back of his fucking head. What do you think? I think it'll work. You got any bananas? No. If you want fruit, go to the fucking grocery store! Uh, two mangoes. Get out of here. Go! Jesus Christ! Are you ready for this? Ready as I'll ever be. You brought the gun? I've got it. What about the gunshot? When the gun goes off, people are gonna hear it. What if there are witnesses? That's why you've gotta be my lookout. Signal me if you see someone loafing about, and I'll back away. Plus, it's late. Look, nobody's around. - You don't know that. - Yeah, I don't. But if something weird happens, I'll improvise. What about the body? What about it? What are gonna do with it after you've killed him? Nothing. We're just gonna leave him. What? I don't think there's anything wrong with leaving the body. Why are you doing this? Why? You know why. No, I don't. Not really. He's leaving. OK, this is it. Are you... Henry. Stop! Stop. What... what are you doing? I can't let you do this! - Kate? - Hey. Look, I lied to you about everything, OK? He's not your half-brother. What? You told him I'm his half-brother? - Yes. - Hey, fuck this! No, don't touch me! He's just this guy I used to date. Henry's your ex-boyfriend? Yes. But the murder trial. This guy killed your mother. Well, he really was on trial for killing a woman. It... it just wasn't my mother. You told this guy I killed your mother? Yes, OK? Sorry! This is so fucked up. Why do you have a gun? - He was gonna kill you! - What? I wasn't really gonna do it. I knew that you were lying to me. I was just calling your bluff. I even did the research on this guy, on the trial. Your parents aren't even dead. I found the speech that I wrote for my father's funeral in your house. You've been lying to me this entire time! And could everyone just calm the fuck down! This thing isn't even loaded. Look. That wasn't meant to happen. There might have been something in the chamber. There's... This was a mistake. I swear. You guys are both psychotic. I should call the cops. No! No, no, no. Don't do that. He's right. There's no need to call the cops. This is just a big misunderstanding. I'm getting the hell out of here. Let's go, Kate. I'm not coming with you! Fine! I've gotta go. Sean. Wait! I guess I'll see you on the other side. Oh, what? The whole suicide thing? I don't know a lot about anything, but I know you're not gonna kill yourself. You came to my father's funeral, though. That was real. I'm still trying to figure out what kind of a sick person would do that, to screw with someone in their weakest moment. A really, really fucked-up person. You're an original. I'll give you that much. No! No, I take that back. You're a fucking cliché! My whole life is a lie. Falling for you? Completely. Kate? Kate? Kate? Uh, hi. It's me. Um... Uh, I'm... I'm... I'm at the house. Could you call me when you get this, please? Uh, thanks. OK. Bye. Hey! Can I help you? Oh, I'm... I'm just looking for my friend Kate. She lives up in this house. Sir, no one named Kate lives in that house. What do you mean? The house is on the market. No one's lived there for the last 4 months. N-no, it isn't. What are you talking about? I was here recently. You've seen me here. I've never seen you in my life. Yes, you have. You waved to me once when you were throwing your trash out. I don't know what to tell you, pal. But you got the wrong guy. I gotta get to work. Take it easy! You're here! Hi! Hey. You came back. Just in time. You moved out? Yeah. Packed up all my junk and I'm headed out of here. I just had a run-in with your neighbour. He told me he didn't know you, and nobody's lived here for months. I paid him a few bucks to put you on. You kidding me? Would you expect anything less? You're certifiable. You are for coming back here. You told me one day that you were falling for me. Was that real? No. I was totally in love with you at that point. How can I believe you? You can't. Kate, are you happy? I've been happiest with you... even when I'm sad. I went to that beach. I told my father about you. What did he say? He likes you. - Sorry about your dad. - Thanks. I still don't, um, understand. Why were you at the beach that day? Why did you write that letter and leave it on my car windshield? I guess it doesn't matter why. I was there at the beach, taking a walk, and I stopped to watch some of the ceremony. I saw you and thought you were handsome. I wanted to talk to you. Are you serious? You couldn't have just introduced yourself? Is it strange that never occurred to me? Strange? Oh, strange is one way of putting it. You really had me believe you had a death wish there for a minute. And when I came back to your apartment and it's empty, I'm expecting to see yellow police tape and a chalk outline of your body. That wasn't my intention. I was hoping you would think I never existed. I was a figment of your imagination brought on by some kind of psychotic break. And everything you'd ever known about this life was wrong. That was my very next thought. Why do I like you so much? Being with you has been amazing and chaotic... random. Being without you, I felt like I've died, like a vampire comes into my room at night and drains all the blood out of my body. ♪♪ I am waiting for you ♪ ♪ And all the lights are low ♪ ♪ Sunrise, I love to follow you home ♪ Sean, I love you. ♪ Sunrise, I'll get you all alone ♪ ♪ Time flies ♪ I love you too. ♪ And one day, we'll be gone ♪ ♪ The memory's mine ♪ ♪ The burning page is yours ♪♪ Tell me a secret.
