Where did you go at night? Sir.. - Go to bed. - Yes, sir. - Okay, sir. - Go to bed. Ashok.. Ashok! Ashok! What is there in your wallet? lt is empty. - What is this? - This is a watch. The man is like a cannon and the watch is just this much? lt is not mine.. wife.. wife.. wife. lt won"t even be sold in the flea market. Get lost! Get lost. Get lost from here. - Yes.. Don"t make any sound. Otherwise.. l won"t make anything. Hail lndia! Hail lndia! Sir you.. l won"t make anything. Kishore.. There is a hooded thief in your room. what are you saying? My father is there, and he has a pistol in his hand. Pistol! lf he has a pistol in his hand, we have four hands too. No.. No.. - Come. - No.. No.. l won"t come. You are unmarried. You go. l have a wife.. one.. and l have four to six children. Go. l will leave now. Hands.. up.. l am not the warden, l am Kishore. Hi! Kishore. - What is this? What could l do, friend? l went out with a pass. l came back through the pipe. When l came back, l met the warden. When will you rectify your ways? lf l didn"t take your responsibility.. ..you"d be chucked out of this hostel long ago. See, friend. lf you do a good deed, don"t show it off. Ashok. l am telling you for your own good. This is our last year in the college. And then these reports and complaints of yours. This is a college, not a wrestling arena. What you say is perfectly correct. But l am a crooked fellow since many years.. ..how will l change myself just like that? At least you can try.. A lion can try a lot, but he can"t be a donkey. But Ashok.. - Good night. Did you do my homework? So you were that hooded thief? Yes, sir. - Why are you stammering like that? You sang poems in the hostel. l have forgiven you. True, sir. - You danced in the hostel! l have forgiven you. - very true, sir. You cleaned the wallets of other students. l have forgiven you. Sir, your character, it is very strong. why do you spoil your habit? Forgive me this time too. - Have you thought me to be God? No.. Have you thought me to be the god of forgiveness? No sir. - Get out of the hostel right away. Get out! Think about it. lf you chuck me out of the hostel.. ..the spring from this hostel will disappear too. lf there isn"t any criminal here, whom will you forgive? Shut up! Sir.. Sir l apologise to you on his behalf. Kishore. You are a responsible student. l have forgiven each and every mistake of his, due to you. But the water has gone above the head now. Please, sir. How many days are left for the exams now? l.. l take his responsibility sir. lf he does anything against the discipline again.. ..l myself will chuck him out of the room. Be assured, sir, l will go away from here myself. Please, sir. l beg you. Forgive him this time. Please, sir. - Kishore. You always take advantage of my soft heartedness. Ashok. Apologise! Sir, with my hard heart.. l will.. l will.. Repent. - l will repent. very good. But this is my last warning. Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir. Tell me. Are you ashamed now?. No, not at all, sir. Of which mud are you made up of? Think about it, Ashok. Why is your brother making you study.. ..even after almost starving there? Because there is a.. - Need. Because there is a need of educated people in lndia. You joke on almost any matter. l haven"t opened up a shop for crying. See, Kishore. ln our friendship going back to crores of years.. ..you always showed me the right path.. ..but l always took the wrong.. Destination. - Destination. But about the right path.. Destination. - lt is one and the same. What is your problem is walking to the right destination? Which you have to walk on the wrong one. You like truth. l love falsehood. See ,Ashok. lf you don"t agree to it today, you.. .. will accept it someday or the other. That there are roses on the path of truth. And there are only thorns on the path of falsehood. You go and see two flowers. l will go and see one flower and four thorns. Come on. We will have some tea. l had starved and collected this money to give it to you. But what can l do? lt is my brother"s last year in the college. lf l don"t pay his fees till tomorrow.. ..his year will go a waste. lf this is the matter, you"ll always be a temporary clerk. Sir! You are my master. Whom will l beg to, if not my master? Even l have some problems. My son studies in the college too. My son"s college studies is more.. .. important for me than your brother"s studies. You can make your brother study even then, if you wish to. l will make another clerk permanent in your place. No. Sir. No! Here, take this. - Keep it on the table there. l don"t touch such wealth with my own hands. Okay, sir. My brother will pass next year. Next year. These are only seventy rupees. what about the rest? l could manage only this much this month, sir. l will give you the rest thirty the next month, l beg you. Okay! Okay. What a time has come? People take credit for bribery too! Shobha"s mother! Shobha"s mother. What is the matter? - Take these seventy rupees. Keep them inside. Where did this money come from on a holiday? Why do you care about kernels when you eat mangoes? You shouldn"t think about where wealth comes from. Yes. You should always keep an account of where it goes to. One two. Tell me, sir. How is Shobha"s study going on? Sir, what can l say now?. l have taught damsels of higher families.. ..in the art of dance. But l haven"t seen such a talented girl. lf this continues.. ..she will glorify her teacher"s as well as family"s name. But sir.. When will that day come? l have heard that even common girls.. ..set up ten to twenty thousand rupees in the film world. l am learning dance as a hobby. l don"t want to become an actress after learning dance. What is the problem in that? Dancing is an art and a talent too. Don"t you know?. There was that.. ..Ramdas cobbler"s daughter, Ramdei in your school? They used to beg and eat twice in the day. Today, that same Ramdei is playing.. ..in lakhs of rupees as Miss Rambha. l had seen Ramdas moving in an lmpala just yesterday. That rogue answered my greeting with a single finger. Mother, please explain it to daddy. To stop seeing such fake dreams. l don"t want to become an actress or anything. Don"t worry, dear. God has given us everything. When we can eat twice with respect.. ..why do we need to dream about lakhs and crores? The people who are fated to travel in carriages.. ..how will they know the worth of a motor car? Can l come inside? Please do. Does Ashok stay in this room? - Yes. Who are you? Me? l am his elder brother. - Oh! Greetings. Bless you. - Where has he gone to? He has gone out since morning. He will be back by evening. Till evening? But l have to go back to Pune by the next train. Please tell Ashok that l"d come.. ..and.. ..and l couldn"t arrange for his fees. l had collected the money. But l had to give to an officer for my promotion as a bribe. Bribe? Who was that fool? What is the use in taking anyone"s name? Make Ashok understand my helplessness. Please don"t worry. l will explain everything. Shall l leave now? Won"t you have any tea or something? May God keep you happy. Dharamdas! How come you are in Bombay? Sir, didn"t l tell you? My brother was in a college? He studies in this hostel itself. Okay. So you"d come to pay his yearly fees? How could l give him the fees? l had taken a day off to come and explain my problem to him. See, Dharamdas. Give the rest of the money quickly, okay? Kishor. Daddy! - Bless you, son. Bless you. Sit! - Are you studying? - Yes. At least you should have told me about your arrival. Son, your college called me all of a sudden. My college? - Yes. Even l am an ex student of this college. There is the annual function of your college, isn"t it? - Yes. l have been chosen as the chief guest for that. ls it so? This is very good. Even l am taking part in that function. - Good! Son, the person who went out of your room now.. Who was he? He was the brother of my friend Ashok. very poor and deprived. He had saved some money as fees for his brother"s studies. But he had to give them to some.. ..un-contentious officer for his promotion. The wrong breeze is working in the world. Taking a bribe from some poor man? Ram.. Ram.. Ram.. This bribery is making our country hollow. The sir takes a bribe from the clerk. The clerk takes a bribe from the peon. And the peon takes a bribe from the people. Ram.. Ram.. Ram.. lt is the wealth of someone else. And miracle of someone else. Kishore, my friend, congratulate me. Congratulate me! Elder brother was fooled this time. Not the money.. yes. Hello. He didn"t send the money and l.. ..didn"t get the form to sit in the finals. Ashok, at least meet father first. - Yes? Father. This is Ashok. Uncle. Greetings. very pleased to meet you. Bless you. - Thank you. What is it? - Your brother had come. ls it? - Yes. He has given some money for your fees. Do you mean to say that l will have study for the examination? Okay, Kishore. l will leave now.. ..Meet me in the Shalimar hotel in the evening. Uncle, please have something before you leave. No. l am in a hurry. - ls it so? Tell me son. Did you take this money from your wallet? No. Your brother gave it to me. l can understand everything. You sing the song of truth all through the day and night. But you don"t stop lying for the sake of your friend too. lf my brother had come here, without seeing my beautiful.. ..face, he wouldn"t have.. What is that? - Left. He wouldn"t have left from here. Okay. l understand. Go now. Get the form. Friend, why do you wish to misfire your father"s hard.. ..earned money on the false friendship of your false friend? First of all, l won"t be passing. l promise you. And even if l do pass, the quicksand.. ..beneath my feet tells me that l won"t be getting any job. See.. Then do any business. But it is not necessary that l pass for the business that l do. We can do it even after failing and drinking cold water. What kind of business is that? Moving materials from here to there. You started your rubbish once again? Go and bring the form quickly. Or else the office will close. See, friend. Someone"s wealth, someone"s miracle. "Oh, my friend, l have seen the world."

Dear students. l was very happy by this celebration. l even saw nice acting here.. ..and heard nice thoughts too. l believe.. ..that the greatest victory of man is to have good thoughts. Therefore, l give this trophy.. ..to my son, Kishore. Ashok, you"d come home with me too. We"d have real fun. What will you do here without me? Don"t worry about lucky people, my friend.

This parrot used to live on the Sun. when the Sun became hot he flew and reached the moon. When two men got down on the moon from the Apollo 11 .. ..and wandered around, it came on earth to Dhoom.. ..Dhaam Ram Chahel Pahel Ram Mucchad Singh. ..Dhoom Dhaam Ram Chahel - Pahel! - Pahel Ram Mucchad Singh.

He emptied my wallets. He was winning all the time. l think that he has found out about our trick. Won"t Dhoom Dhaam Ram Chahel Pahel Ram.. ..Muchhad not know about it? Okay! So you are the one of that sun moon and Apollo 11? - Yes. Boss! This man is very crooked. The one who can fool me can fool everyone. He can fool you too! - Shut up.

You mean, singing and dancing and all that? - Yes. Yes. Okay. Agreed. But on one condition. l won"t return whatever l have earned now. Okay. Agreed. - What will be the salary? 25%/ percent of the total winnings. 25%/. Okay. Okay! - Okay! lt will be fun when two crooked people sit together. l thank you so much! You fulfilled my brother"s trials. Shobha! Dear Shobha! - Mother! Mother! l will take a party from brother today. He has already promised me that.. ..whenever he passes, he will treat all my friends too. See. My Kishore has come. Kishore, son, how are you? - What is this, mother? Why are you making a face? You have passed first class. Won"t you let me kiss your forehead too? The happiness of passing is incomplete, mother. My friend Ashok failed. - That"s it. The whole world"s pain is in brother Kishore"s heart. Brother. The one who worked hard, passed. And the one who didn"t, he failed. No, Shobha. You don"t know. lt was more important for Ashok to pass than me. He is from a poor household. He has all the responsibilities of his brother. Forget other people"s sorrows. First, go upstairs and tell dad your good news. He is waiting since such a long time.. ..that you will pass and become a big man. Go! Daddy will be so happy! Go! Sir. Here are the rest of the thirty rupees. You have come at the right time. l need this money urgently today. Sir, but please keep me permanent from next month. See. l don"t keep anyone"s gratitude on my head. But Dharamdas, don"t think that l asked you for a bribe. l have just fulfilled my needs. You haven"t fulfilled your needs, daddy. Say that you have taken the fire.. ..from someone"s burning funeral pyre.. ..and kept the kitchen flame of your house burning. Kishore. What are you saying, son? You? - How do you know my son? - Why are you asking him? Ask me. This is my friend Ashok"s elder brother. l understood why Ashok couldn"t.. ..get the money on time during the examination admission. Sir. l.. l will leave now. Daddy. You hold a big post in the office. The government pays you one thousand rupees every month. Then why are you making us eat bread of sin by taking bribes.. ..from a common clerk who earns one fifty rupees? Whatever l am doing, l am doing it for my children. You are a child now. You are immature. You won"t be able understand the ways of the world as yet. You are right dad. l am a child. l am immature. Therefore, l couldn"t understand till date.. ..that the perks and leisure we stay in the foundation.. ..of that is placed on the bones of the poor. Kishore. l see that you have learnt rebellion staying with others. Just think. What happens in one thousand? Your fees. The family dues. Shobha"s studies. The petty expenses to stay in society. Money is needed for all these things at every step. All these are your needs, dad. But who will understand his needs.. ..whose salary is just one hundred and fifty? Who has to feed his family twice in a day. Who has to pay the rent for his house and make his brother study. l had come to give you the good news of my passing. l am repenting now. l have studied due to the money earned in sin. Fie on such studies! l spit on such a degree. Which has been achieved by the sighs of someone poor. What is the matter? why are there loud noises in the house on such a joyous occasion? You heard the noise. Mother. But listen to what has been going on the house silently too. Daddy has been teaching me by taking bribes from poor clerks. You tell me. Will such an education be of any use to me? Will l be able to show my degree to anyone proudly? Son.. please don"t be angry. - l won"t leave my anger, mother. l will surely leave this house though. Brother.. Shobha. You know what our father is up to. He has dealt in other"s helplessness and become rich. l won"t stay in that house.. ..which has the stink of bribes, greed and tyranny.. ..in it"s leisures and perks, That"s enough. There is a limit for gibberish too. Mother.. l am going. lf you wish, you can come with Shobha and me. l will work hard and feed the two of you. Brother. Why are you so adamant? lf Daddy has committed any mistake.. ..why are you giving him such a huge punishment for it? l"m punishing myself not him. Now, even the walls of this house come to bite me. l feel like choking in the air of this house. l don"t care and nor am l related to dad"s wealth. Kishore! Kishore, my son! Brother! - Kishore! - Brother, please don"t do like this. Nobody can stop me now. Even drinking the water of this house is a sin for me now. l am taking these trophies with me. This is the earning of my hard work and my brains. There is no place for such earnings in this house. Kishore.. Kishore, please stop. - Brother, please stop. Mother. Did you see, dear? The greed for wealth has shown us this day today. lt is good in a way, mother. When Kishore isn"t here, dad will.. ..come to know that the earnings of.. ..sin cannot buy the happiness of a child. Shobha. Save me! Help me! Thief! Thief! - Shut up! Shut up! - Thief! Thief! l will kill you! l will kill you! Thief! Thief! Thief! Aren"t you ashamed to do such a bad thing? Aren"t you scared of God? Dear.. Dear.. What happened? what happened? That thief was trying to snatch this chain from my neck. This uncle drove him away. Come on. Ask for uncle"s blessings. Come on Okay, brother. We will leave now. May God look after you. Hey, my suitcase? Are you mad that you are laughing at my loss? Not me. You are mad to put your hand in a stranger"s fire. So, is it a sin to do good to someone? When you will understand this, you will become a big man. You fool. This is the new world. The one who walks on the right path.. ..he doesn"t get the path. And the one who walks on the wrong path.. ..the destination itself comes to him. lt is someone"s money and someone"s miracle. Ashok, you? - My friend, your bag. Did you steal it? Go! l am not some ordinary, common.. - Useless. - Useless.. ..thief. See, he was taking this bag away. As soon as l saw it, l understood it immediately that this.. .. suit case belongs to my truthful friend and nobody else. Hey, You"d gone home isn"t it? Why did you come back? l had to leave it forcibly. - Okay. Come with me. Where? - l am not taking you to an orphanage. l am taking you to my house, Royal Palace. Come! And such a house that there"s everything here! Look, Look. Hey. This is a very good house. From where did you get all this? God gives one whatever he wants after all. lf he wants sugar, he gives him sugar. You tell me. Why did you come to Bombay? Ashok. l have left my house and come here. Hey! Have you decided to leave all material wealth? Not leaving material wealth. l am looking for a job. l fought with father. Afight? An honest and innocent person like you fought? And that to with his father? Ashok. l saw the true colors of my father. He used to take bribes from poor people and fill his coffers. And on top of that, he didn"t even spare your brother. Wonderful! Your father is really fit to be revered! His principles and mine meet. Even he thinks that if the world can be fooled, it should be. My friend, we two great.. - People. We two should be able to teach you something. See. Keep your results to yourself. The enjoyment that exists in the starvation of a good man.. ..doesn"t exist in the buffet of a bad man. lt seems that you have become a sage permanently. "Hail Shyam! Hail Ghanshyam!" What is it? - "Hail Shyam! Hail Ghanshyam!" Forget the hymns and come to den. ls it something special? - Obviously. But this person"s face seems to be new and matters.. ..of business aren"t discussed in everyone"s presence. Look, Kishore. Don"t go anywhere till the time l return. lt"s your own house. There is beer in the fridge and whiskey in the bar. lf you want to succeed in life, both are necessary. And if not, drink cold water and sleep on the Dunlop. lsn"t it? Come on. This much is enough for you, okay? "l have held this bottle of alcohol since so long." "l have held this bottle of alcohol since so long." "Come on, drink it. lt has.." "Come on, drink it. lt has.."

Here. This is your account. Twenty five percent, five hundred rupees. And this is yours. - Wow! That"s great! Boss, today such a ready scapegoat came. All his pockets were full. And Ashok cut the goat such! We cut him such, we flayed him! He didn"t even have a single penny with him. l think that if he goes out to the crossroad.. ..he will have to beg for alms to go home. very good! very good! Look. l am going, tell sir. lt is someone"s money and someone"s miracle. Hey, Kishore! Where are you going? Give the cobbler your suit measurement. Then give the tailor your show measurement. They will understand it between themselves. - For what? To make you a man, my friend. lf you wish to stay with us, we need this fire. This old quality trousers and old shirt won"t do. - Take this. You keep this pride of credit. What is the matter of credit in this? You helped me so much in my college days. l just brought some clothes for you. What is bad in that? Take it. Ashok. l won"t wear clothes with which.. ..the body will be covered, but the soul be stripped naked. l saw everything in the Carnival.. ..and understood everything. Your lifestyle is the result of conning, gambling and lies. Conning and lying is an art. Brains are needed to understand that. Art! very good! Such good thoughts in this era! Tailor and cobbler. You search for another house. The story here has lengthened a bit, isn"t it? Come on. Have your food. l won"t have the food. - Why? Food earned by sin doesn"t become blood after going inside. lt becomes poison! Which party is he a member of? - Go away from here. You say that the food of a friend"s house is poison? This isn"t a good thing. Come on, eat the food. lf l had to eat food like this, l wouldn"t.. ..have left my parents and my sister. Please don"t be so adamant. l won"t let you go hungry.. ..from my house. For the sake of our friendship! We don"t have any friendship or relation from today. Kishore.. Kishore.. Kishore.. Kishore. My friend! Please listen to me! How did you say that we don"t have any relation? lf not love, let it be hatred. But how can you break the relation of so many years? For God"s sake, please don"t follow me. l don"t want to turn back and see from the path that l walk on. Don"t turn back, my friend. But how can you finish friendship? l agree that we think differently. But in a thunderstorm.. ..if moving on a single raft if a sage and a snake can.. Adjust. -..then why can"t we two do it? lf only you be as good a person as you argue. l am bad. But l am better than those good people.. ..who call themselves good and think bad for others. My friend.. You have left your house. Neither do you have a job, nor a place to stay. l ask you. lf you leave me, will you.. ..make a bed out of truth and sleep on that? My friend. Goodness isn"t a vitamin pill.. ..with which you will wipe away your hunger. At the most, l will die of hunger, isn"t it? But l am ready for that too. - You fool! Life is inviting you with her open embrace and you.. You wish to sleep in the lap of death? What you think to be life, Ashok.. ..in my eyes, it isn"t life, but worse than death. l know that the journey of good and truth is very long. But just how travelers cover thousands of miles.. ..and reach the place of worship.. ..and take the blessings of God and forget.. ..all the sorrows of their journey. There will surely be such a day, Ashok. l will become a big man in the world due to my goodness. And God forbid, you may be eating the food of the police. lt may be possible that this is upturned. There is a lot of strength in money. lt can buy man"s religion, conscience, everything. What if one day, this society becomes my slave.. ..and then you.. You may be taking your empty bundle of good and truth.. ..moving in the unknown darkness of being unknown.. ..may God forbid, ebbing in the pond of your tears. This isn"t possible. - Why? Why isn"t it possible? very good, Ashok. You walk on your path. l will walk on my path. l will bet for three years. You walk on your principles for three years. And l will walk on my principles. We will meet each other under this great soul"s shadow. And we will see what you are and what l am. Agreed, my friend. But will you be able to hold the wounds.. ..of this fake world, without the support of your friend.. ..with the support of only your truth, for three years? Truth is such a twig, Ashok that can cross an ocean too. And bad is a bad scare. lt can"t face even one fell swoop of thunder. That will be known. Do you bet? Three years from now. - Three years from now. This same place. - This same place. This time. - This time. This time. - This time. "May you have the thorns of truth." "l will have the flowers of falsehood." "l will take that path which will have colors on every step." ""Colours at every step."" "There are a lakh paths for falsehood.." "..but there is just one destination for truth." "The one who fears God, all his problems are cleared off." "Oh Friend! "Oh friend!"

"l have seen it properly with my eyes." "l have seen it properly with my eyes." "l have seen it properly with my eyes." Sir. l wish to see the carnival one day too. You see my face everyday. Am l anything less than the carnival? What happened, Chaman? What happened to you, Chaman? What happened? Did you mother die? My mother died even before l was born. Then did you come from the sky? Why are you crying? l am crying for the dancer who ran away with her brother. Are you mad? Does a girl run away with her brother? Neither have l become mad and nor you. l have found out that one of her.. ..brothers is a very big thief and dacoit. The two of them met and stole all the wealth of the carnival. l came here with whatever was left here. Hold me! Or l will die! You twigs! First you were crying for the dancer. Why now?. l am crying for the owner of the carnival. When he came to know that the dancer has washed him away.. ..he has dried clean all of us. - What are you saying? l am telling you the truth. The carnival owner was the father of the dancer! He ran away inside the night without giving anyone anything. The tent owners are searching for us with knives and daggers. Okay. - Run away from here. - very good! Wonderful idea! What an idea! lt is better for brave people.. ..like us to escape from the back door. We will run away from here somewhere.. ..make the carnival. The maidens are with us. And they have.. - Wealth. Someone"s money, someone"s miracle. You are troubling yourself and me needlessly, lnspector. l am not a smuggler. l am just a superintendent of an office. We have proper proof that you have generated a large amount.. ..of black money by accepting bribes. Look at this, sir. So much gold and money! What? Tell me! From where did an superintendent of the office.. ..get so much gold and money? - lnspector.. This is not my personal apartment. l am a tenant. lt is possible that landlord has hidden it here. lt is a very good excuse. But it is very weak. lt won"t work. All l know is that truth doesn"t need any shelter. The decider is the almighty. The almighty decides after our death. lt is here that the decisions are taken as we live. Apply the handcuffs! - Mother! Have mercy! Please have mercy! Our respect of the house will be thrust in the dust! l have a young daughter. There will be a hundred obstacles in her marriage. l am sorry. l sympathise with you. But l am the servant of the law. Come on. Please come on. Are you going to prison? So what? Big leaders have gone to prison. Mother! Brace yourself, mother. Brace yourself. Daddy"s deeds bore fruits for him. What will be done by your cries now?. Our happy family is burnt! lf Kishore would have been here at this time.. ..there would be some kind of support. For us, all the paths of the world have closed down. Mother.. So what if the paths of the world have closed down? The door to God is still open. See, mother. l set everything on it"s place. Dear. We left the house and the city too. Why should we decorate strange walls now?. Mother. You have tied sorrow to your breast. We will have to stay in the color that he keeps us in. Yes, dear. We will have to live till we breathe. Dear.. What kind of life is this? There is ration for a few days at home. And there is only darkness ahead. Mother. Please don"t worry. l have learnt dancing. l will do any job in a dance academy. l am not rotten that l cannot feed two people. The burden that my son had to lift.. ..my daughter is lifting it today. Mother. You have started crying again. We cannot smash our heads against the walls of fate! This wall can be broken by patience and change. lf God wishes, we will meet brother Kishore somewhere. lf we were fated such, why would be leave the house? lf your dad had listened to him.. ..we wouldn"t have to see this day. Forget it, mother. lf man didn"t take birth.. ..there wouldn"t be the problems of joy and sorrow. New lndia Dance academy. "The heat of Love." "The tracks of the train."

Yes. - Yes. Please have a seat. Bring it. Here you are. But tell me. ls money taken to work here, or it is given? Which circles of taking and giving are you moving about? These hundred rupees are for the photos and all that. - l see. Your meter will start after the contract. How many lakhs.. - Give a pose.. Not romantic, tragedy pose, of a solemn hymn. lt"s done. Come on! Come on! - Please take care of me. We will take care of you. - Please give me a chance. Yes. We will give you a chance. Yes, yes. Bye-bye. lt is a good start.

Manipuri, Kathakali, Bharatnatyam (dance forms).. l have completed studying all these. You seem to be from a good family. Won"t your family members have mind you working in films? They used to mind sometime. But now, the situation in the house is not good. Therefore.. - l understand. Look.. lf you give me a job in your company.. ..l assure you, l will bring glory to your company"s name. Even we have that hope of you. The fees for admission in our dance academy.. ..is just a hundred rupees. - Hundred rupees? l don"t have hundred rupees. The bangles in your hands will surely be for hundred rupees. Here you are. They are real, aren"t they? - They are real. But.. l should get the job. - That is the matter of the talent. lf you move into our.. - Thoughts. You will surely be a heroine. Greetings. - Greetings. Tomorrow morning. Okay? Go. Friend, the girl seems to be a cow. ln our business, cows, sheep and goats. All are one and the same. lt is good that we earned something. Tell me, Kishore. Are you still singing about good and truth.. ..or did you learn something about the world too? Where have l learnt it till now?. Okay. Tell me. Who gave you my address? l came looking at the board of such a huge store for a job. l didn"t know that you were the owner of this store. You can become the manager of some orphanage. You aren"t able for a job of some firm. You have to lie at every step in business. l am asking you for a job. And you are teaching me the ways of the world. The fact is.. l cannot give you a job. My business is very new and.. Do one thing, Shekhar. - What? Keep this with you. And give me a hundred rupees or so to fight life. what do you think l am? Can"t l give my college friend a hundred rupees just like that? Don"t make me a beggar. - A beggar? l am making you a guest. Here. Take this hundred rupees. And have some food first. lt seems that you are hungry since four days. Not four days. l am hungry since two days. Take this. Go. - Keep this bag. Boss. Which note did you give him? The same one. - The same one. lf this note works, our hard work will bear fruit. We can do a lot of work with this man. Conman! Betrayers! They say something and do something. A loss of two hundred rupees in one day. Raju! Keep this carefully. - There was a film company here. l am tired of giving an answer to anyone who comes here. l don"t know what the boys and girls today think. l didn"t understand what you say. l don"t have the need to explain it to you. There isn"t any film company here. Thieves, dacoits and looters have.. ..looted the money of boys and girls and ran away from here. They fooled us too! Give me one plate. - A hundred rupees note! l don"t have change. Take the token and have food. Take change later. Why are you starting like a machine? The plate is ours as well as the stomach is. l am very hungry. l have met the God of food after two days today. Are you hungry since two days? Are you unemployed? Think it to be such. - Mister! This fake note will not work. - Fake note? What do you mean? No meanings! Take out another note. This is the only one l had. Where should l bring another one from? Then wash your hands and come to the police with me. Why do you clutch the hand of someone who is eating food? Have l opened an open house for conmen? why are you shouting? Show me the note. Go. Sit on the counter. - Okay. But you are responsible for it. Yes! - They come to eat for free! Eat nicely. But from where did you bring this.. ..hundred rupees note while you are unemployed? There is a store nearby, Truthful Agencies. His owner is my friend. l took it on credit from him. lt doesn"t matter. Eat. Who says that it is a fake note? This is a real note. l will make the hotel owner understand. This will be your good deed to me. Otherwise, l would be hungry today too. Who can stay hungry when l am here? What is bad in this note? - Has it changed? Hey! You change the number of the glasses. Come on. Give me the change. - Should l cut your money too? Do you want to go up so soon? Here, brother. The rest of the money. Thank you, very much. Can l know your name? l tell my name only to the police, not to the people. What has this world come to? Even if a friend helps a friend it is by a fake note. A proper man becomes a criminal. Greetings. - Greetings. Why did you come here, dear? - l"m looking for job. There isn"t any special vacancy here. Ebb of hope rushed through me looking at your dance academy. l thought that l would get some support here. Support? Yes. All responsibilities of the house are on me. For my mother, l am the only support. ls it so? What do you know, dear? l have learned the art of dancing. l know every kind of classical dance. lf you wish, you can give me a chance to teach your girls. l will be very grateful to you. Please don"t be disappointed, dear. l can give you a job as a dance teacher. But you will have to work very hard. l am not scared of hard work. l am just scared of unemployment. You aren"t unemployed any longer. Start your work from today itself. Thank you. Why were you so late in your lunch? Your city is a strange one, Shekhar. Why? What is the matter? People don"t know difference between a real and a fake note. Didn"t you get change for a hundred rupees? - l got the change. - Why has your face fallen then? But l got food with insults. - How?. You knew that l was hungry since two days. When l sat on the table and started eating.. ..the counter person started shouting at me. This note is a fake! l was stunned. A honest man meddled in between.. ..and told him to see carefully, the note was real. After that, the counter person apologized to me. Here is the rest of the change. Why are you embarrassing me? Will you move in such a huge city all alone? Keep it. Keep it with you. We have got a trunk call from Agra. We have to reach the money to the factory at this time. Okay. Take my car and go to the factory with the money. l have a police commissioner"s party at my place. So, whom should l send such a huge amount with? Kishore, will you do something for me? Tell me. - l have to reach a lakh of rupees to Agra right now. l cannot trust any stranger. Therefore, l tell you. Take my car and reach this money there. l am scared, Shekhar. What if something happens on the way? Hey! You are the worshiper of truth! Why does truth need any proof? Give me the bag. Take this. Here are the keys to my car. Best of luck. Here. Share it amongst yourselves. They wish to have fun with their friend"s wife. Brother! Will you search a thief, rogue or pickpocket for me? l am a thief, rogue and pickpocket. But l have only one ambition. l should give your hand in someone"s hand.. ..who does hard work and labor.. ..and earns money from that and lives. l met a very good and innocent boy in the restaurant. l felt like catching him and bringing him home. But l was ashamed of myself. This business is something like this. Come on! Follow him! Thief! Brother! Thief! That"s strange. A thief in a thief"s house? See, brother! Thief! - See.. You? But through this window.. See, some hoodlums are following me. l have a lot of money. lt is someone"s money. Please hide them. Did you see that, l was speaking.. ..to you about this boy. Come with me. Sit down. Show me the notes. These notes are fake. - Fake? Who gave it to you? The same one who gave me the hundred rupee note. That note was fake too. - What? - Yes. This is the note from the morning. l had changed it with my real note. Because l had seen innocence and honesty in your face. And the people who are following you.. ..aren"t hoodlums, they are the police. Police? What will l do now?. What will happen? Anyone must have printed the notes. But they are with you now. You will be caught. And do you know what is the punishment for printing notes? Seven years. - Prison? Punishment, for me? l think that even looking at someone"s money is bad. God! l have been stuck in such a problem. Open the door. Police. Don"t worry. You hide here. Hide here? Why should l? l didn"t commit any crime! l will prove to them that l didn"t print these notes. l will go to the police and tell them everything. Don"t be a fool. You will become old in prison while proving your innocence. But it"s possible you won"t be heard even then. You haven"t dealt with the police as yet. Give me. Give me this bag. - No. How is this possible? Someone does and someone pays? - Don"t talk foolishly. lt is one and the same for me to go to prison or on the bus. Open the door! - But promise me one thing. You will take care of my sister Meena after l have gone. Please don"t worry. Open the door! No, brother! What are you doing! Please don"t worry. The police is my old friend. Brother! - Open the door, or else, l will break it! lnspector! - Who came in this house climbing the wall? The door was closed. l came through the window. You? what is there in this box? - For what you have come. Oh! Fake notes. So our suspicion was correct. My hands are here. l have worn this bondage so many times.. ..and removed it so many times. - Take him away! Wait. Please close the door. lf it is open, the thieves come inside. ln this world, friends become enemies. And a stranger leaves the freedom for someone.. ..and takes the choking air of the prison. l have seen this world now. l have understood it now. l will see that Shekhar now! Come. l will lay out the food for you. ln the happiness that l sent your brother to prison? No. Because for the first time a good man.. ..has stepped inside the four walls of sin. No. l am not good. The one who has gone to prison is good. You stay here. l will come quickly. Police! A raid! What are you saying? Did you find me to be put in danger? You were a boy from a good and comfortable house. Why do you wish to print fake notes and become rich overnight? This is rubbish. My notes were real. You must have changed them. Kishore. You"d come starving and naked from home. Did you intentions change when you saw wealth? l can give my life for a promise. But l cannot even look at a stranger"s wealth. lf you have any humanity left in you go to the police.. ..and accept the crime of printing fake notes. And have that innocent Prakash freed. Who is this Prakash? My sympathiser. He stays in this city. Oh! That rogue of the first order, Prakash? Kishore, otherwise, you sing tunes of truth and goodness. And you make friends with such common criminals? He is my enemy. lt is good that he is in jail. You should be in jail. Kishore. l am silent due to our old friendship. Otherwise, l can ruin your life by accusing you.. ..of changing notes and printing fake currency. Shekhar. The roots of truth are in hell. You cannot even touch me. Get lost from here. Or else, your ashes will fly in the breeze of this city. May it be so! But before that, you will have to come with me to the police. You will have to accept your crime. Come with me! - l am coming. l am coming. Wait! lf you love your life, go away from here. Wait! lf you love your life, go away from here. Shekhar. l won"t listen even.. ..if l have to give my life for Prakash. Kishore. What happened? why are you so scared? Tell me! What happened? What happened? l couldn"t even crush an ant below me in my life. But l killed Shekhar for my safety today. Murder! You killed Shekhar! The police must be searching for you then! - No. Yes. - Only the dead and me know this secret. How did this happen? How could l do such a huge sin? l will go mad! Meena, l will go mad! Brother! What happened? - Did the police release you? what will the police release me? l myself left the police. l fooled the police and ran away. But Meena, we should go away from here quickly. lt isn"t safe for us to stay here for even a single moment. But where will we go? There is such a big world. You two.. Go there. l will reach there. - But.. please listen. l don"t want to listen to it now. Later. Change your appearance first. Hurry up. Why? whom are you mourning as the sun sets? l just remembered a friend. - Who is that? The same Kishore. - Okay! That Nekiram Sachaichand? He must be starving somewhere. - God knows what"s his situation. See, when we ourselves are in the thin of things.. ..how can he be in the thick of things? The hundred-rupee note is finished. What will we do about the dinner for night? These bangles are left now. Give it to me. l will arrange them quickly. Or else. Keeping stolen things with us.. ..means that wherever we are, we aren"t far from prison. Sell them and make arrangements to eat and drink. And also arrangements to sleep at night. Go quickly. Come quickly. l am hungry. Don"t worry. l will be right back. Who knew that the kitchen would.. ..ask for fire and the utensils will ask for grain one day? Don"t worry mother. l will arrange everything. - How? We have two silver glasses, isn"t it? l will sell it and arrange for the ration. And then, l will be getting my salary in a couple of days. We will work our lives for a couple of days like this. Yes, dear. Hunger is a huge thing. We have to sell everything for this. Give it to me. l will sell it. lt is time for you to go to work. May God give him happiness! He took your bangles too! What are you looking at the bangles, sir? Look at the one who is selling it. lt is made up of real gold. Have some patience. We only deal honestly here. Someone"s helplessness is dealt in, sir. Those were the days. These bangles would clink in my wife"s wrists. lf only she"d be alive today. You"d see that even a fairy didn"t have such fair arms. Did your wife expire? - She did! She did! She was from heaven, she went there. When you will die, you will certainly meet her. And you will see that l am really crying for her. What is the cost? - Two hundred and ninety rupees. Two hundred and ninety, that"s it? You have to show your face to my wife after your death. And she has a say in heaven, sir. Raise it a little here. lt will be helpful there. Okay. You make it a total three hundred. l have these two silver glasses. Let the gold be sold first. l will look into silver later. Whose bangles are these? - They are golden bangles. Did l ask you whether your silver glass.. ..is made up of silver or not? Then, why do you ask me whose bangle is this of? Sir! These are my bangles! They are yours? - Yes! - He was selling them! How can he sell them? They are my daughter"s! This conman snatched these from.. ..my daughter by giving her the greed of a job. Why are you lying in old age and arranging for a ticket to hell? You take out two hundred and ninety. No. Sir! You call the police quickly. Thief! Thief! Catch him! Run! run! Run! - What happened? We are caught. - How?. That girl"s mother came to the shop where.. ..l went to sell the bangles. She recognized the bangles. The police are chasing us! Run! Catch them! - Thief! Thief! Catch them! Catch him! ""Today.."" "The season of spring has passed." "The season of spring has passed."

Yes. You can do that. But before doing that, take your bangles. You had still kept these bangles? See? lf l were a thief, l would have sold them.

This world is not worthy to be seen. Think that l am your son. The doctor has told you to eat fruits. l have brought some fruits for you. But why do you sympathise with me? l have heard that the ink of.. ..sin washes off with the sympathy. The God who created night, created day too. Dear.. This is you. Even though you aren"t related to me.. ..you are serving me like a son. And there was that sinner who made.. ..me blind for his own need. May God forgive him. Mother. That sinner has died. He has died? How do you know?. l knew.. him very well, mother. l burnt his funeral with my own hands. This is very bad. Even he must have been the son of some mother.

They have reached today morning itself. l will call them right away. Hey! Meena! Kishore! Close the door. - The door. What is it? Look. The seer has come to meet you. Seer? Why does he wish to see me? Son. You have stepped into a new world. l have come to bless you. - Surely, seer. Surely. Which new world, seer? Dear. You have left the locality of the false goodness.. ..and settled yourself in the pure locality of the bad men. Dear, see the.. - Oh! Brother! Brother! How did you disguise yourself like this? l couldn"t recognise you at all. - Really! The glasses to recognise me haven"t been made till now. lt is good that you reached a safe place. Meena. - Yes? - These grams won"t do. Will some eatable be arranged with this? Why not? l will bring it right away. Yes! Meena! Feeding a seer is a very good thing! Listen.. - Yes? - This is a new place. Be a little careful. - Yes. And we should start our business.. ..on some auspicious day. Day after tomorrow is the full moon night.

One should commit the first theft in light in a new city. And then, even you will have a rebirth day after tomorrow. What do you mean? Day after tomorrow, we teacher.. ..and disciple will go in search of our hunt.. ..on different roads at the same time. Give me whatever you get, thinking that it is my fees.

Just how every new child has his.. ..name written in the municipality.. ..as soon as he is born, just like that.. ..l get the news of every theft and every murder first. l assure you. l didn"t want to kill Shekhar. He wanted to kill me. His dagger killed him in the scuffle. The god who has written the horoscope.. ..of the saints and seers, the same.. ..has written the horoscopes of thieves and dacoits too. Whether Shekhar was killed with.. ..his own knife or whether you killed him. Whom all will you go on telling this? You will be tired of proving your.. ..innocence but nobody will ever believe you. But the situation.. - What about the situations? You are a kid now. Nobody can fight against fate. lf one could fight, we wouldn"t become dacoits and looters. All of us would do some nice job. Therefore, enjoy in whichever place you are. Become a man. Tomorrow is the full moon night. You have taken my eyes, but gave me a good son. Shobha! - Yes, mother? Have you prepared Ashok"s room? - Yes, mother. Ashok - Yes? See son. Don"t leave my side ever now. The world yearns for a mother"s shadow. Will l leave that shadow after getting it? Please don"t worry. l will leave now. lt is time for the factory. Okay, dear. - Mother. l am late too. Shall l leave? Go, dear, go. Take this milk. - Okay. Mr. Ashok.. Will you keep on crushing iron even after studying till BA? l am looking for a good job. l have seen an advertisement.. Of a job in the police force yesterday. l have typed its application and put it in my pocket too. why have you put it in your pocket? Because, today is my birthday. l thought that this new year would start nice for me. By the way, l will post it today itself. Why didn"t you tell us earlier that it"s your birthday? l would make some sweets for you. l would bring some gifts for you. You have done so much for me. ls all this less? Congratulations. Your youth has taken another step towards old age today. Why are you making me wear this garland? So? Should l make her wear it? You will be the one making her wear it one day. Either today, or tomorrow. Okay. l will leave now. The peon goes to work first. - Ashok! ls it your birthday today? - Yes! Yes. Mother. But l don"t celebrate it ever. - Come on. Dear. l had made this ring on my son"s birthday. l didn"t sell it even in hunger and bad luck. Take this. Son. This is for you. - Mother! Why is this needed? l do not celebrate my birthday at all. Don"t refuse it now. Here, take it. Thank you, mother. - Bless you. l am not worth this. But god knows whether it lightens.. ..my life in the days to come. l will keep it and come. l will be right back. Who is it? Hey! Who is it? Who is it? Didn"t Ashok lock the house? Brother! The bell for the holiday has already rung. Haven"t you heard that hard work.. ..and labor is the work of God? l thought.. ..that l"d do tomorrows work today itself. That is all right. But today is the day.. ..that your hard work is about to rewarded. That means, today is the day of your salary. Come on! We will take it! Come on! Hey, are you seeing your face in these notes? l am seeing the difference between yesterday and today. l had money yesterday too. But the happiness that.. ..is there in these that money didn"t have it. So, we will have a tea party in that happiness. - Not one, two. - So, come on! Dear.. - Wait! What is the matter? Are you testing your digestion? You are just eating it as long as l have been seeing.. ..l don"t know what the matter is. Ever since l have been eating from my hard earned money.. ..my appetite has doubled up. Maybe because l have worked hard. Well. Right now, you"re eating it wrongly! - How is that? l"ll be paying the bill, isn"t it? - That is not the matter. Even l can pay the bill. But l am a peon.. ..and you are a bit higher than me. But in today"s world, the upper people.. ..eat the money of the peon. But you"re not of that quality. - What should l bring now?. Bring the bill now. - What should l bring now! Come on. How much is it? - One ten. One ten. One ten. Give four altogether. Friend.. Brother.. You can see, isn"t it? l am sorry. l can"t see clearly during the night. - Okay. Hey, put the light on. Hey, Who is it? Thief! Thief! Did he take something? My wallet. My wallet! - Your wallet? - Yes. My wallet. Did the thief really take it? - What happened? lt hailed as soon as we shaved our heads. As soon as we came inside, his wallet was stolen. l don"t care about my wallet being stolen. All l am sorry is for is that l couldn"t.. ..give mother my first hard earned money. Did you listen to that, mother? - Yes, dear. The person who stole my Ashok"s wallet.. ..may God kill him where he won"t even get water. Please see. The clothes and all are just rummaged. Has he taken something else too? He has taken it. He has taken the ring. Congratulations, Guru. Congratulations, Kishore. Congratulations to everybody. The two of us had a successful first strike. Here. This is my earning today. And teacher, this is my fee for your teaching. Hey. This seems to be real. - l got only papers. And you got silver. You will enjoy life from today. Brother.. - Check if this fake or real. This weighs a lot. And there is a name etched on it too. - A name? Yes. There is a name etched on it. Hey. The letter K is etched to it. Worked out on some similar named person? Mother. Dear, did you come so early today? l was very late in returning. l can hear someone close in this voice. Kishore.. dear! - Mother? Mother.. what happened to your eyes? Tell me, mother! What happened to your eyes? Please don"t ask anything, son. Don"t ask anything. Many mountains of sorrow fell on us after you left. Your father was sent to prison. We were ashamed of facing people.. ..and therefore, we left the city and came here. Shobha, had to look for a job. A motorcar trampled me down. My life was saved, but l lost my eyes. A mother"s eyesight is her children, son. Please don"t cry. You have come now, isn"t it? What will l be sad about now?. Dear.. Tell me. where were you since so many days? Mother. After l left the house l saw many colors of this world. What do you work as, son? l don"t slave for anyone, mother. l borne wealth just like now the world does it. Where is Shobha? She has gone to the vegetable market. Okay. Mother. l will leave now. l will meet Shobha later. Will you go so soon, son? Yes, mother. My business takes place in the night. l have to keep an account of my partners in the day. Give my love to Shobha. You don"t worry. l will have you cured. You will be able to see again, mother. Okay. l will leave now, okay? - Bless you, son. He just came and then left. Hey! A Government letter! Hey! The police commissioner has written to you. Has he opened your old file? Shut up! Shut up! - Open it up quickly. Athief will stop thieving, but not conning. l have won it! My friend! l had applied to join the police force. l have got a letter from there. ls it so? - Yes! - very good! - Shouldn"t we have a party? No! l have to tell Shobha first. You have to tell Shobha first? lt isn"t your fault. The English has taught you, ladies first! Shobha! Shobha! What is this? What has happened? l am very happy today. lf it was something so joyous, you should have been patient. You should have reached home. lf l wouldn"t meet you, you"d tell mother. This thing can"t be told to mother. There are some such special things.. ..which can be told to only special people. Okay. So l am just someone special till now in your eyes. l can only think what you are in my eyes. l can"t tell that to you. - Then you.. Till when will you speak to me like this? Till the time l wish it. A person thinks with his own brains. Shobha, l may be crazy. But there are many things in my heart.. ..which are just cramped up inside. This distance isn"t good. - You are a tall and strong man. But you are a bit thick-headed. - What? Ashok. - Shobha. ls the distance wiped now?. - No. lt is wiped out now. - Okay. Tell me the good news now. Hey! l had almost forgotten. Look at this. My appointment letter. l have got the job of a police inspector. - Really! - Yes! Thank you, God! Now. Come with me. - Where? - wherever l take you. lf we get a couple of days of love in such a huge city.. ..it is all right. ""A couple of days of love are better than.."" ""..are better than..""

""A couple of days of love."" l will give mother the good news first. Why should you give the news? l will tell her. Why? was it you who joined the police, or me? Are you acting haughty as a policeman right now?. - Why not? l have double rights. - How? - First of all, it is my mother. Secondly, you are mine. Mother. - What is the matter? Mother. We will have to leave Mr. Ashok now. What are you saying? - l am telling you the truth, mother. Mr. Ashok has got a job in the police force. ls it so? - Yes. - You have given me such good news. l will give you some good news too. My son Kishore had come. - Really? Why did brother go without meeting me? He will be coming almost every day now. He has really become a big man now. God listens to everyone. He listened to my sons a bit late. But at least, he did listen. Okay. So you have become a police inspector now. Yes, mother. With your blessings. These are the blessings of God, dear. Who blessed him. Come on. Present yourself to him. Mother. You have snatched the words from my mouth. Look, l have arranged for the worship-plate. Okay. Come on, dear. You people go. l have just returned from the temple. l have to go to the office. Thief! Thief! - Catch him! Mother! Mother! Friends. Kishore is the rightful owner of this seat. ln our clan, the person who kills two people.. ..and handles a big heist, this seat is to be given to him. Kishore. Your name isn"t Kishore any longer. Your name is the Rebellious Star from today. Hail the Rebellious Star! Shobha, the people who have to go.. ..don"t come back ever. Only, their memories linger. What do l have except mother"s memories now?. l don"t know what has happened to this world. The cost of human lives is lesser than an ant too. God save the mother of that killer who borne him. very good, Kishore! The old woman"s soul will be very happy with you. You gave her nirvana. She must be tired of her blindness. Teacher, the nearby areas have the.. ..name Rebellious Star etched in their minds. Why shouldn"t they have it? After all, he is the bravest of the brave. The Rebellious Star? - Yes. The same dreaded criminal who has made life.. ..difficult for the common public as well as the police. According to our information, he has.. ..ran away from here towards the north. Ashok. l am giving you a great responsibility. - Yes sir. lf the Rebellious Star is arrested by you.. ..the public, it will be the betterment of the public. The police will earn a good name. And you will be promoted too. l assure you. l will think duty to be dearer than my life. Bringing the Rebellious Star dead or alive.. ..is my religion now. - Well said. The police there have been told about this. lt will help you in every way. Here is the file of this case. Wish you all the best. - Thank you, sir. Friends. All of you share the five lakhs out.. ..of the ten that were stolen from the bank. And keep the rest of the five lakhs in our gang"s fund. what will you do of the fund when the gang isn"t there? what are you saying? - My people have just found out. The police have chosen some inspector.. ..Ashok to arrest our gang. - Ashok! Why were you shocked by this name? No! Just like that. l remembered an old friend with same name. lf only he"d be with me right now. The two of us would have looted the whole world. Where is he nowadays? - l don"t know. Well, forget the memories of the old friend. We have to finish lnspector Ashok first. You people set your traps too. - Yes. Boss. And yes, Madan. Tell Meena to be careful too. lnspector Ashok"s death is our life. His life is our death. The Rebellious Star"s life has become.. ..death for the people and an insult to the police. But apprehending him is a risky job too. The life has no worth in the path of duty, Shobha. With your requests to God, l will surely apprehend him. wherever there are good intentions.. ..there are God"s blessing there. With God"s blessings, l have a friends blessings too, Shobha. lf only he"d be with me today. He would be very happy to see me! Who was he? - He was a messiah of truth. Friend. Please take me to help you too. No. Chaman. l am working for the police, not you. So what if you are the police man? Even l am the servant of the people. l will work without any pay. lt is possible that l will catch the Rebellious Star before you. Catch a fly and show me first. - A fly? Here.. -Come on l will come too. Catch it. - See. lt is in the tea. - Come on! - l will come too. - Okay. Shobha, l will leave now. l will right to you as soon as l reach there. Take care of yourself. Shall l leave? No, darling. Please don"t touch me. l have vowed that till the time l don"t.. ..apprehend the Rebellious Star, l won"t touch you. Excuse me, sir. - Yes? lt"s an honour meeting you. Are you lnspector Ashok? Correct. l am the private secretary to the Commissioner of police here. But.. there isn"t anyone in khaki? lt is sir"s order that l should receive you all alone. Because the Rebellious Star"s people are everywhere. Correct. l will come right away. Please come, lnspector. What is the matter? The commissioner uses a small car? Shut up and sit down. Come on, Sheru. That means has it started? Come on! - Help! She is eloping with a man! Not here, up there. Oh! - The snake bites too. l am going. Please tell me which is this place? l am feeling very hot. Don"t worry. We will cool you down. Him.. - Who is this new passenger? He is a first class passenger. He is Ali Baba"s treasure for us. lnspector Ashok. - lnspector Ashok? Pleased to meet you. - Shut up. What should be done with him? The Rebellious Star will decide this. Lock him up carefully. He is priceless. lt is expensive. But why do you take the trouble of locking.. Come on! Come on! - No. He cannot be him. - What are you seeing? l am seeing that what the astrologer had said is true. And what did the astrologer say? He had said that you will die at the hands of some.. ..gentleman some, gentleman wretch. What?! You are calling me a wretch? Not you. But the one who will kill me. l will just tell you how a gentleman kills a wretch. Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! - Shut up! Baldev, Tie him up! - Baldev.. Baldev.. Tie my hands too, otherwise l will run away. Friends! l have brought the Kohinoor diamond today. The Kohinoor diamond? You created a problem. lt"s a bad omen. The one who gets it"s shadow is finished. But we will finish it today. l have got the lnspector Ashok. lnspector Ashok? How many lnspector Ashok"s are there? Meena has just caught an inspector Ashok. l have tied him up in the dark dungeon right now. What? lnspector Ashok? - Yes! - No! However. The Rebellious Star will decide this. My people are bringing him with them. Tie him up in the dark dungeon too. Okay. Come on. Bring him in too! Tie him up! Tie him up with this wretch too. Two are better than one. All of them will be stunned when they see two inspectors. Boss. - Yes. Rebellious Star.. We were waiting for you. Do you know?. We have caught two inspector Ashok"s. Two lnspector Ashok"s? - Yes. And the teacher says that Rebellious Star will decide. Come on upstairs. Where did the two go? These two have disappeared! Teacher! Teacher! - What is it? - The two have ran away. This inspector was very smart. The police have found out about our den. We will have to leave our place quickly. But where will we go? - Go and tell everyone. Go. Madam. You need a motor, l need a passenger. Money is saved in the bus. Time is saved in a taxi. What do you say, should l open the door? Okay! Come on! Quickly! Hey, why did you stop it here? This is the house of my sir. l will just give him yesterday"s account. Please bring the madam inside with respect. Hey! What is this? Guru! - Why are you shouting? Guru! - Here it is. lt is a major problem. What happened? - Meena is caught. - What? Yes. l saw it with my own eyes. A Khaki clad person made her sit in a taxi and took her away. This means that the police is still following us. What is new in this? The police has been chasing us since years. l am worried because of Meena. What if the police torture her and she spills our secrets? Meena is my sister. l know that death cannot scare her. That is all right. But woman is the name of a weak thing. lf Meena shows her weakness.. ..the bullet from my gun will silence her forever. - What are you saying? - She is your sister. Till the time she keeps our secrets in her heart. Not after that. Come. No! l am not connected to those dacoits. Surely. Tell me that you didn"t have a hand in carnival theft. You know the Rebellious Star nicely. Rebellious Star? l haven"t even heard his name. You have heard it now, isn"t it? Tell me where he is straight away. You cannot save yourself from the clutches of the law. There is a distance of just ten seconds.. ..between your life and death. Tell me the whereabouts of the Rebellious Star. Your life will be spared as a Government witness. Otherwise, l am helpless. l will just count ten, Rosy. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. - No! Seven, - The rebellious Star! - Eight. - Nine Nine. - And my brother.. Someone has shot her! She has been shot! Take her to the hospital immediately. Send the police down below, quickly. Rebellious star, learn to live like a brave man. Meena was my sister. l killed her for my principles. What can l do? The ones who spill the blood of others.. ..can spill the blood of their close ones too. Guru! Today is the 15th August. Today"s day is a very symbolic day for me. l have written the legend of dacoits.. ..with the blood of my sister. 15th August? - Yes. Fifteenth August. lt is good that you reminded me today"s date. l remembered a forgotten date. What kind of promise? - One of meeting an old friend. Three years ago, we two had promised.. ..to meet each other on this day itself. l will move now. My friend must be yearning for me. - Go. The plan that l have made to apprehend the Rebellious Star.. ..if that plan succeeds.. ..it is just the matter of a couple of days. This isn"t a Rebellious Star, he is a problem to the life. Whenever l see, you are saying the Rebellious Star. lt is a responsibility. - That is all right. But why do you forget that Shobha is coming? We have to go to the station to receive her. Shobha is about to come today? Shobha! You have come? - Yes. l have come. Couldn"t you come to receive me on the station too? Shobha, you know why l have come here. l have work sometimes. l have to shoot sometimes. You have to shed blood sometimes. Chaman! - No. You don"t have to shed blood. You go. - l"ll go. l want to speak a lot to you. Come on. You go! Wow! Come on, friend. l was about to come to the station. l was dressed up too, when all of a sudden.. ..the commissioner called up, and l was called there. Please bring some tea quickly, son. l will have some tea quickly and then leave. The commissioner has called me. Today, we had freed mother lndia.. ..from the chains of slavery. And we had promised ourselves that we will.. ..keep this day"s respect all through our lives. We will have to keep the promises that we took today. 15th August, 1969 is dearer to us than our life too. 1969. 68. 67.. 66.. What are you thinking about? lt is three years already? Three years? Shobha, l have to go somewhere. - Where? To keep my promise. To meet my friend. You have to go to the commissioner. The commissioner can wait. My friend shouldn"t wait. He shouldn"t wait. My friend! "Oh, my friend, l have seen the world." "l have seen it nicely, with my own eyes." "lt is difficult to recognise who is good or bad here." "Oh, my friend, l have seen the world." "Oh, my friend, l have seen the world." "l have seen it nicely, with my own eyes." "lt is difficult to recognise who is good or bad here." "Oh, my friend, l have seen the world." "Every morning of mine is the festival of colors." "Every evening of mine is the festival of lights." "This is the world of two days. lt is not going with us." "Whose heart is pure.." "Whose heart is pure climbs even after falling down." "Look at the moon that sets and moves ahead." "Oh, friend!" - "Oh, friend!" "Oh, my friend, l have seen the world." "l have seen it nicely, with my own eyes." "lt is difficult to recognise who is good or bad here." "Oh, my friend, l have seen the world." "May you have the thorns of truth." "l will have to flowers of lies." "l will tread on the path which has color on it"s every step." "There are a lakh of ways for lies." "There are a lakh of ways for lies." "There is just one destination for truth." "The heart which fears God thinks.." "..that every problem is easy." "Oh, friend!" - "Oh, friend!" "Oh, my friend, l have seen the world." "l have seen it nicely, with my own eyes." "lt is difficult to recognize who is good or bad here." "Oh, my friend, l have seen the world." "Oh, my friend.."" Please say something. When the heart of two friends are.. ..talking to each other why should the lips work? l couldn"t even think that you would change so much! But you are just strong as before. Okay, tell me. Did you marry or.. l will be marrying very soon! Okay. Tell me how the to be sister-in-law will be? ls she ebony, fair, tall, broad? - She is like a Goddess. lf you see her, you will go crazy. Okay. Tell me. Did you meet your dad? How is your mother? How is your sister? - All of them are all right. What did you do in these three years? where all did you go? What did you learn and teach? Tell me! l did all that in three years which.. ..l wouldn"t have been able to do in three hundred years too. Life took may turns. lt is a colorful story, my friend. Some girl has come in your life? Have you found some better friend than me? Not a friend, my friend. But l certainly have found an enemy. He is thirsty for my blood and l for his. He is searching for me. And l am searching for him. Tell me who he is. Why shouldn"t l finish my friend"s enemy? Don"t be excited, my friend. l have learnt how to color my hands with the enemy"s blood. You are saying this? - Yes. l am saying this. No. You used to step lightly on the floor.. ..so that your feet don"t crush any ant. You were a very.. - Non-violent. You were a non-violent person. You are joking. - l am not joking. He isn"t a man who doesn"t walk with time. l think.. The world can change, but my friend can"t change. Everything can change. Look at me. l picked so many pockets, looted and thieved.. ..so many places and people in these three years. You can"t think about all that. You had told me that the bad buffets.. ..don"t have the fun of a honest starvation. Truth is the twig that can cross an ocean too. To hell with the truth! And to hell with the good. ln the world where there is no place.. ..for good, it is stupidity to be good in that world. Listen to the whole thing, my friend. Do you remember? l used to dance.. ..listening to the radio during my college days? l dance just like that, listening to sounds of bullets. l have become a very big man. l have become the leader of a gang of hoodlums and thieves. You must have heard the name of the Rebellious Star. - Yes. My friend! l am him! You! You are Rebellious Star? Yes. Ashok. l am him. My enemy is a ClD officer. Till the time l don"t whet my forehead.. ..with his blood, these eyes won"t get any sleep. Forget these things. Tell me. What has gone on with you? My story is very interesting too. l have spent these three years in helping people.. ..serving the poor and supporting justice. Helping people, serving the poor and supporting justice? You are saying all this? l won"t believe it. How will you not believe it, my friend? lf a person like you becomes a devil.. ..then can"t a devil like me become a man? Wow! Time takes a nice turn too. l wore your disguise and you wore mine. Okay. Tell me. What do you do nowadays? Me.. l am searching for an enemy too. He is chasing me, and l am chasing him. One of our death is playing hide and seek. Why? His death is playing hide and seek. Quickly tell me who he is. My friend"s enemy will die at my hands. No, my friend.. l will do this good work with my own hands. Give me your pistol. Whether it is your gun or mine. The friend will be handy. As the friend wishes it. Hands up, Kishore. What joke is this? This isn"t a joke. This is reality. l am that officer whose blood you thirst for. That ClD officer? lt is you? That means, two friends will challenge each other? You can"t make me forget my duty for my friend"s sake. Don"t forget, Ashok. l am your oldest friend. l think my duty to me more than my friendship. lf you are my friend, you will help me in my duty. Look, Ashok. This is the question of my life. Will you hang me and fulfill your duty? Remember those college days.. ..where l helped you at every step. Hands up, or l will shoot! No, Prakash! No! My friend! Driver, come quickly! Welcome, Rebellious Star. Here, have this. Where is the teacher? Rebellious star, l have come. l have brought a very beautiful and fragile gift for you. lnspector Ashok"s fiancee. - Where is she? Go. Go and have a close look. She is very good bait. Shobha? - Brother? Shobha? Brother? Teacher. She is my sister. A girl is always someone"s sister. Meena was my sister too. What are you staring at? Kill her. Prakash! - Athief and dacoit"s conscience is just money. He isn"t anyone"s brother and neither anyone"s son. He doesn"t have any sister nor any mother. So, brother. You have become a thief and a dacoit? You had left your house for your principles. Mother, father and sister. You had kicked the perks of life just because.. ..you didn"t like your father taking bribes. Tell me. Tell me. Did you do all this to be become a thief? Do your work. Emotions don"t have any importance in our religion. Take this revolver. Take it! Guru, Guru. The police have surrounded us from all four sides. - Yes. The police have come? Kishore. We don"t have much time. Clear the enemy from the path first. l will settle with the police till that time. You go that side. l will go here. Shoot me. The hand which tied the sacred thread of fraternity.. ..on my hand, how can that hand shoot his sister? The hand on which l used to tie the.. ..sacred thread, wasn"t the hand.. ..of a thief, dacoit and murderer. Many of our people have died. Leave with the others. l will stop them. Surrender yourself to the police. Shobha, you run away from here. l am not a criminal to run away from here. Shobha, my life is ruined as it is. But you have your whole life in front of you. Run away from here! Ashok! Ashok! Kishore! Ashok! Brother! Brother! Do you know whom you want to shoot? l know him very well, Shobha. He is my friend Ashok. Brother! Don"t you know that he is my life partner too? Ashok! Ashok! Ashok! The man whom you want to kill is a dacoit.. ..later and my brother first. My only brother! Your lone brother! But he is my only friend too! My lone friend! Will you kill your friend? l wish that he should kill me. But this time, l am not Kishore"s friend, but the servant to law. You don"t come in between, Shobha. You have to decide what you want to sacrifice. Either your love or your brother. Ashok. Kishore. - Ashok. Surrender yourself to me, Kishore. l don"t want to be the murderer of my friend. How did you decide from now itself that l will die? l wish that l should become the aim of your bullet. But l don"t wish that you should.. ..be accused of killing a friend too. lt doesn"t matter. One friend"s death will be another"s life. Brother! Kishore! Kishore! Brother! This moment is so beautiful. Even if l am dying, l am dying in my friend"s embrace. Kishore! The bullet that killed you was the bullet of law. But the embrace, in which you are dying.. ..is your friend"s embrace. Okay, tell me something before l die. who won? Did lies win or did the truth win? You won, Kishore. You taught me the lesson of truth. But friend, you forgot everything. l remembered it. No, Ashok, you have won. lt is very easy to be bad from good. lt is very difficult to become good from bad. Brother! l couldn"t give you anything in life. Today, l will give you one last present while dying. That present will become the vermilion on your forehead. Brother! Ashok, l am leaving Shobha in your care. Don"t think her to be a dacoit"s sister. Don"t give the name of enmity to life.. ..long friendship in the last moment of life. My friend! - My friend! Okay.. now l will.. Move! - Move! Move! Cry as much as you wish today. Maybe the truth behind your tears will.. ..stop my soul from wandering about. My friend! l am going. - Leaving memories? Memories! Here.. see this. See this.. Brother! Kishore! - Brother! Brother! "Lies have a lakh of paths." "Lies have a lakh of paths." "There is just one destination to truth." "The one who fears God thinks that all problems are simple."
