Ssh. Evening, Marney. Hi, Ian. How's it going? It's going good. How are you? Did you hear that music down the street last night? Uh, no, I didn't. What was it, some kind of party? I think it was a rock band. I went over there and then told them knock it off, it's the middle of the night in the middle of the week. Kids. Punks is what they are to call themselves. I think that is what they call themselves. Have a good one, Ian. See you later. Bruce. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Oh, no. What the... Hello, yeah, yeah. I... Yeah, I... I think somebody broke into my house. I don't know, I just got home. No, no, I know nothing. I think they broke it to my house and... Killed my cat. Okay. Okay. Hey, Richard. Oh, no, no, not interrupting anything. I'm just putting this crib together. What's up? Yeah. Tonight, I'd love that. Yeah, I just need to talk to my wife, but she should be home any minute. I definitely want to come. It sounds great. Your friends sound awesome. No, I could drive myself. Well, if it's on your way then sure, I just, I don't want to... What? Hold on, hold on. What are you doing? Hi. - Whom are you talking to? - No one, it's fine, one second. Yeah, she actually just walked in. It should be fine. Yeah, okay, thanks, Richard. - Bye. Oh. - What should be fine? Nothing. - Who's Richard? - Remember, um, I told you I met that guy at a bar. Uh-huh. I guess. What does he want? Just wants to meet-up tonight. Oh, he asked you on a date? Very funny. How was your day? - It was bad. - I know. Got a new school, substitute teacher, you know. - Yeah. All right. - Just fresh meat to those kids. - Rough. Kids suck. - Plus, you know I'm gigantic. You are not. Beautiful. Did you finish the crib? I didn't, but it'll be done by tomorrow. - Great. - Yeah. - Did you hear that? - What? What's he saying? - Call me Jackson. - What? - We just decided on Grayson. - I know, but... - We don't have that much time. - We do. He could come any day now and we need to have decided on a name. I know, but, you know, I think that when we see his little baby face, we'll know. - We'll just know. - This is so like you. - It's one of those things. - A man with no plan, just winging it. Okay. You got to see these. Mmm. Up to no good. Do you want to come out this time? Oh, come on. Richard's an interesting guy, you'd like him, it'd be fun. And we should make an effort to... This isn't fun. You don't have fun around here. I'm not saying that, just we used to have fun all the time. I have to get out of the house. Yeah. Yeah, it's not my idea of fun tonight to go to some bar and watch you and your new old friend drinking together. - He's not even that old. - Okay. He's nice. You should go and have a really good time. You've been cooped up all day, you don't have work in the morning. You should go. I'm exhausted, but you should go. Oh, my God. - Yo, you guys trying to sneak out tonight? - I don't know, man. My mom would kill me if she found out I was skating that late, I don't know if I could do it. Again, like he said, like it depends like my mom goes to sleep around, like... - It's crazy sometimes... - My mom goes to sleep early. I don't know what time my mom exactly goes to sleep, but if she goes to sleep and like it's not hot or like dangerous, look I'll go, but like you'll go regardless, even if we don't go. Yeah, man, but I'm just saying you guys are going to miss out. Yeah, bruh, that would have been some sick ass shit. Get that gap next time, bro. Yeah, I know I should have stuck it. Come here. Come here. You want some food, Luna? - Yo, you guys want some noodles, by the way? - Yeah, sure, I'll take a cup. Oh, you get wrecked, man. - Bro, I killed them twice, I killed them twice in a row. - Oh, thanks, man Dude, you just got blasted in the basement. You got blasted in the base wax. - I am. How many cues you got? - We're tied. Shut up. We're tied. - Get in here before it starts pissing rain. - Coming. - All right, thanks for getting me. - Yeah, man. - So you got fired today. - Well, I left. It's not like losing a janitorial job something to be too upset about. Have you had many jobs? Yeah, I mean, yeah, I guess I worked, um... worked as a bartender for a little while. I was a bank clerk, I worked as a deli cook, you name it I can do it. - Pretty decorated. - Yeah, you could call it. Yeah. What about you? - You had a lot of jobs. - Yeah, I've had a couple, but mostly as an editor. All right, I remember you saying that when we were at the bar. I remember you telling me you were a film editor. Film editor. It's a stretch. I do like online commercials. I just did a commercial for a sink faucet. So that's where I'm at. That's pretty great. You get to stay at the house all day, I didn't even think of that, you get to work from home. No. That's actually kind of shitty. Like never see anyone, you know, like, I'd prefer to be out in the world. It was easier to do that when I was in the city. I don't know, people are pretty much the same anywhere you go. Like all places, you got interesting people. People not so interesting, nice people, shitty people, good people, bad people. So, you're saying... What? I mean, since it's all the same what exactly, just stay where you are. Yeah. I'm not saying like this place is better than other places or anything like that. I'm... I'm... Obviously, I like it. I like it, you know. I like my house, I like my car, I like, uh, getting drunk with my friends at my bar, you know, so for me, it's just this is what I like. I don't want this to sound rude, but do you grow up wanting to do something, like be an astronaut or an actor? So did I want to grow up, you know, to be an ambitious person. - Yes. - Yeah, yeah. Well, what happened? Well, reality is what happened. If your kids go to college and they're going to read, uh, Nietzsche and Madame Bovary, they'll bind that all up and do precisely what with it? Serve burgers with me. That's okay, man. Cut him some slack, right? Encourage them to find something they enjoy, something that makes them happy, because we're all going to end up in the same spot. The burger flipper and the Nobel Laureate both shit sitting down, we're both gonna die someday the same way, confused, scared, full of regret, right? Because we're visitors here, man, that's the thing, Jimmy. We're just visitors down here. Hey, Natalie, it's getting cold. Why don't you bring Polly inside? Okay. Come on, it's cold. Can you put Polly in the living room? Thank you. Why can't Polly live in my room? Because she'd make too much noise, she'd keep you up at night. Then how about the backyard? I think it's too cold for her out there, don't you think? No. - We'll find her a nice place inside. - Okay. - Go wash your hands, dinner's almost ready. - Mm-hm. - Something going on outside. - What? There's a cop car parked outside of, um... What's that lady across the street's name, Mary? - Marney. What's going on? - Hey. Careful. - I don't know. - I hope everything's all right. I'm gonna go over there and see what's going on. What are you gonna do about it? I just wanna know what's going on around here. Aren't you curious? I hope Marney's okay. I'll report back. Uh, bring an umbrella, looks like it's gonna rain. Can I help you? I just live right across the street there, and I was wondering if everything was all right. - Somebody killed Bruce. - What? - Her cat. - Stomped him to death. Animal control just picked up the body about 40 minutes ago. Things like this have been reported the last few weeks, so... Pets being killed. Why doesn't the public know about this? Well, at first, it'd appear to be unrelated, but we're doing everything we can to catch the perp. - Yeah, but... - Let us know if you can think of anyone else who might have done this. - I'm sorry for your loss. - Thank you. - What an asshole! - I thought he was nice. You're all right. Is there anything we can do for you? - Fine, thank you. - Are you sure? Really, I'm fine, thank you. I just... I think I'd like to just be by myself for a while. Let us know if you need anything. Remember, we're just right across the street. What are you doing out? Come on. Is this your house? Wow. It's nice. It's my house, man. - You grew up here? - Yeah. - Damn. - Yeah. - After you, sir. - Thanks. I'm just... - Oh, okay. - So I'll get you a drink or something? Uh, are you just going to grab some stuff? - No, I mean... - Thought we're going to the bar. I can't afford to go to a bar, I just lost my job. - I could treat you. - I know. I got a fully-stocked bar in here. - Come on. - . It's too late. I've been inside all day. I'm stuck inside. Just trust me, I invited people over. We're gonna have a little party. We can have a party at a bar, tell them to meet us at the bar. - This is better. - Why? Just trust me. Come on. What are you drinking? How was that last take? Do you think we should do it again or did it seem... I think the wind was picking up a little bit on your mic, at the end. - All right. - Let's just start again from your out throw. - Okay. - All right. Go ahead. Oh, wait a second, They're gonna walk through. Hi, sir, my name's Jane. - Hi, Jane. - Um, would... Would you mind if I interviewed you? - Yeah, I don't think so. - No, I... We're doing a story on pet owners in the community and I really think it would help raise awareness about the issues, if... - What is the story? - Oh, you haven't heard. There's been multiple pet slayings in the neighborhood. - Oh, my God. That's shocking. - Yeah. I... really think it would help raise awareness, I think... I think people should know about this. - All right, sure, yeah. - Oh, great, thank you so much. I really... I really appreciate it. Um... I'm here right in front of Marney Wilson's house. - Oh, my God, it happened here? - Uh, yeah, right here. Oh, my God, I'm sorry. I cut you off. I'm sorry. That's okay, that's okay. Um, let's start again. - Okay. - We'll just do it again. - Ready? - Yep. Okay, cool. I'm right here, right in front of the scene of the crime, where Marney Wilson's cat was brutally murdered right in her own backyard. I'm standing here now with a concerned pet owner from the community. - What is your name, sir? - Isaac Lieber. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Lieber? - I am a social studies teacher. - That's great. And how do you feel after hearing that such awful things are happening in your community? I feel very bad and sad about it and as I said before, I think it's quite shocking, because I've lived in this neighborhood for over 10 years with my family, and I have never heard of anything like this happening. This is, by far, the worst thing that has ever happened here. Do you have any idea who could be behind such horrible acts? No, your guess is as good as mine, but it's obviously, someone who is very sick. It could be a kid or it could be an adult, but whoever it is, they're very sick. Mm. Yes. Very sick indeed. And will you be taking any precautions with your own dog, uh, until the person perpetrating these acts is caught? Yes, absolutely. Franny here usually roams freely, she comes and goes as she pleases. Isn't that right? But from now on, if she's in our backyard, we're going to have our eyes on her, and if we're not there, she gonna be inside, because we want her to be safe until things go back to normal. Well, I sure hope things get back to normal soon too. - Thank you, sir. - You're welcome. It's good? Did you like that? Come on, come on, come on. Damn. Oh, my God. All right, I got to go. - I got band practice, man. - I'll see you later. - Yeah, I'm going to leave. - , so you can give me a ride to my mom's house. - Yeah, sure. No problem. - Thank you. - You are out too. - Yeah, bro. - All right. Peace out, bro? - See you, guys. - I'll hit you over. - All right, that'd be a place. Hi, Ian. I heard, Marney. Heard about Bruce. News travels fast. Yeah, well, Chinese guy next door told me all of them. He's Korean. Yeah, well, he was all through their whole damn neighborhood lock their doors. Brought you some beers. Figured you could use one. Yeah, you know, Ian, thanks but I am... Yeah, I'm not really much of a beer person. Yeah, well. You might change your mind, I'm gonna leave them. Ian. Yeah? Sorry, do you want to come in and have one? You remember Mike at the bar? Mike was the other guy. - Yeah. Yeah. - Okay, so check this out. I saw Mike last week, he was all busted up, 'cause his dog went missing. I saw him last night, and he say, "Well, my dog's back." Oh, that's great. Oh, not so fast, somebody had taken the dog's body, dead, murdered body and dumped it in the yard like, "Here's your dog." It was defiled, just defiled. Ritualistically, like just sick. It was a beautiful dog, it was a black lab pit-bull mix. They cut it from its neck down to its nut sack. Turned it inside out like an old sock butcher. - Fuck. - And then like as a statement, - put back, "Here's your dog." - Did they find who did it? - No. - Does he have enemies? I don't know, man. No. - What did he do? - He drank, man. Somebody did that, because it felt good to do it to that person. - Did they find the person? - No. - Oh, that's, dude, that's weird. - Yeah. And this psycho is just running loose in that neighborhood. We don't know, we don't know, if he's a psycho, right. - What are you talking about? - I mean, how do you know? - Uh, he murdered a dog and turned... - And that's what we know. Right? It's interesting, though. Really interesting. Somebody got pleasure from doing that from taking that dog and cutting, they did it, because they liked it, obviously. - Oh, yeah. - Just get the chills. There were organs where hair should have been in hair on the inside, it was vital. All right, I'm good. - May I go watch TV now? I'm done. - Sure, honey. I can't believe it happened right across the street. I didn't want to bring it up in front of Natalie. - It's horrible, poor Marney. - Poor Bruce. That's a good thing, we don't have a cat. Well, we do have a bird now. Either way it doesn't make it any less terrifying, I don't want to scare you, but whatever kid's doing this kind of stuff is a killer. You think it was a kid? A dumb, bored, psychotic teenager with mommy issues. Kids like that always turn out to be serial killers or like shooting up their high schools. That's what's so unnerving. - Are you worried about Natalie? - Of course. Oh, gosh, I think we moved to a place like this, so we can keep her in a safe environment and something like this happens. - Why isn't anyone doing anything? - Well, it could be anyone. The cops said that this happened before, it just seemed to be a motive, just senseless killing. Can we change the subject, please? Honey, that doesn't make things more safe. I know, but just thinking about it makes me really scared. They'll find the guy soon. Let's just change the subject. I broke it, I broke my imported shit, bro,. Everybody used to. Word. Like I just used to get, "What?" that's crazy, dude. Yo, we just What is his name,. - Sorry, I'm late. - Look, who's late. Always being late, man. Well, there's traffic. Let's get this started, dude. Let's get to the dance floor. - Get this jam session... - Let's get it! Ah... - You ready, though? - Yep. You ready, bro? ♪ What the fuck is? ♪ ♪ What the fuck is? ♪ ♪ What the fuck is? ♪ ♪ What the fuck is? ♪ ♪ What the fuck is? ♪ ♪ What the fuck is? ♪ ♪ What the fuck is? ♪ ♪ Come over here ♪ ♪ Fucking all that shit You're done ♪ ♪ Fucking ♪ ♪ Shit ♪ ♪ What the fuck is? ♪ ♪ What the fuck is? ♪ ♪ What the fuck is? ♪ ♪ Fuck is up ♪ ♪ Fuck is up ♪ - What the fuck was that? - Oh, yeah, yeah. - That was hard, bro.

Graham. - Graham. Nice to meet you. - Edy. - Edy. - Good to meet you. - Albert. - Albert. Come on, dawg.. - Can you help me out with this? - No, that's you. No, this is me. I'd like to have a glass of wine. - Will you open it for me? - Yeah, I'll see if we had a wine opener. - Yeah, you can do that. - Yeah. Of course. So, Jim, how do you know our dear friend, Richard? - Uh, let me guess, the bar. - Oh, yeah. Richard's quite the drinker. That's how we know him too. Helps us only two bars in town. There's one that the old people go to, and the one the young people go to, so guess which one we go to? Well, whichever one it was, I had a surprisingly very good time. Oh, that's such a good answer. - Those old drunks talking about their shitty days. - Not so bad. Hey, um, where'd you get that? You're looking out of bed. You think I could get your number. So, a friend in need is a friend indeed. - Cool. - Got you,. Um... Yeah. How much could I get for, uh, 20 dollars? - 20 sack double down. - Edy. Edy. Edy. There's no wine opener. Shit out of luck. Well, thank you very much, you invite me to your house and you don't have a wine opener. I can open it. I could do, I could do that actually. - You are a wine opener. - I could do it. - Not a wine opener per se but... - But I'll open the wine. - But, yeah, I can open the wine. - Magic. - I know a trick. - What's the trick? - He's good. He's good. - He's checking the wall. What's he doing? - I believe that's your wall. - No, no, no. Testing the boundaries. Okay. What? - Wow. - Okay. Oh, my God. That was amazing. - You don't mind drinking it out of the mug? - As long as it's a clean mug. - I got to learn that. - Thank you very, very much. Ah, you got some sales, my friend. - Thank you. - If you weren't here, I wouldn't be able to have glass of wine. Well, I'm glad, I'm here. Nice place you got here. I've been coming up and down these streets past your house for I don't know how long and I've never been inside. I don't think I've ever seen the inside of your place. We've been neighbors for I don't know, how many years now? Four years. You've been a good neighbor, though. Nice, quiet, not too much chit chat. You think one of these assholes killed your cat? One of the other neighbors? Ah... I don't know. I just... I just still can't believe that it happened. - Things like this never happen around here. - Yeah. Probably one of those sicko kids, huh? The most ornery kid I've ever met would never do a thing like that. Fuckers! I know he's just a cat... - but he was just like family. - Yeah, I know. You wasn't around here when I had to put poor Charlie down. God, Ian, I'm so sorry. Yeah, I love that dog... same as you loved Bruce. After the wife died... there was nobody around but me and Charlie. Just like it was, uh, you and Bruce. What happened? Charlie was a Pitbull, had a thing about him, wheels. Every time a car go by, he started barking, run to the window. One morning, Charlie got out of the house right when I was getting the morning paper and the shittiest thing happened at the same time, a young girl was driving by on her bicycle, must have been no more than seven or eight years old, had a pink helmet. And Charlie, oh, Charlie scared the hell out of her. They tried to say that Charlie bit her... but I know better than that, Charlie didn't bite anybody, I was right there and I saw it all. But anyway, they put pressure on me... and a week later, I had to put Charlie down. Oh, God, Ian, no, I'm so sorry. Poor Charlie. He didn't hurt nobody, you know. You can't be nothing but what you are. If they was going to prosecute and persecute anybody, it should have been me. I'm the one that let him out. Poor Charlie. He's gone. I was thinking about getting another dog. But I don't know, I just never got around to it. Another? Sure, why not? So, Jim, did you just move here? Uh, yeah, I've been here for like, maybe three weeks. How are you taking to it, man? - I like it. - Yeah? I used to like the liveliness of the city, but I'm adjusting, slowly, but surely. Yeah, that's cool, man, you got kids? - No, yeah, one on the way. - Oh, nice. Well, it's the burbs, man, it's the ideal place to raise kids. - Oh, you guys have kids? - Oh, God! No. Charlie's angels. Quite the addiction. Mmm. - It seems more like a habit. - It's an addiction. I mean, yeah. I think it's more like a bad habit. Yeah, it's exactly like that. For worse things, as long as you're not hurting anyone. And I'm addicted to something far more serious than any drug you can think of. - What's that? - YouTube. That wine trick, I learned that from YouTube. Oh, see, I just thought you had that like in your back pocket. I think about my kid just being born into this generation, that is internet all the time. I mean, that is for his entire life. And your kid, he will never know what it's like to not have that information, though. The kid will not know what it's like to not know something. - Richard, no internet... - Can you believe that? Old school like a fucker. You don't have a computer? - What will I do with a computer? - Live. Yeah, yeah, all right, don't get him started, don't, don't... Oh, man! Look, look, look, look, all right, look. Oh, here he goes. That's real, the joint is real, you could touch it, it could burn you, right, it can burn. It's real, there's something there. The rest of this stuff is just fake shit, there's nothing there, man. The internet, computers, smartphones, television, it's fucked, it ruins people, it's Luciferian. It's fun. Well, then you should find other ways to have fun, man. - Luciferian, you said. - Yes, it's bad. - Wow! - Yes. So, Richard, um, what have you been doing with yourself now that you've been unemployed, I mean, what real, real things, I mean, real, have you been working on? - What's on the horizon? - Presently, I've had my friends over, and we're drinking and we're smoking and we're listening to records, you know what I mean? Okay, is that new? No, it's not new, but it's happening, it's real. - I like it, I think it's good. - It is good. - I will drink to that. - Yay. - To the same old, same old. - Same old, same old. - Cheers! Cheers! Yeah. Yeah. - Cheers! People in one neighborhood say they are living in fear after two pets were killed. The frustration is mounting, because no one knows who's responsible. One of those cats was just... is that authorities are not doing enough to try and catch this pet killer, in the neighborhood where the cats were found on top. Hey, little guy in there. You want to hear a poem that your mom just wrote? Just don't be too hard on me, I haven't written anything in a long time. "No one counts the middle child, no one misses her. I used to leave the house at night my footsteps undetected from my bedroom to an open field, a glow with yellow as the sun gave up its brilliance, each day, the same soft light, each night's distinct finale, I always left before the darkness was complete and walked back the way I came filled with light inside of me, one night, the sounds of songs broken the music thrust me from my cave of dusk into their light, the songs were warm to me were far away yet mine, the voices in the house were filled with laughter laced with song, melodies enveloped me, I let them fill me to the brim until the dark was thick enough to swim through, I couldn't sing them to you now, but I can tell you what they told me, there is so much still unseen to you that you may watch in secret all your days." What do you think? Too sentimental? Okay, dude, I gotta go. - Oh, no, two times, two more tunes. - I must get going. - Two more tunes. New guy has to dance more! New guy has to dance more! You are such good dancers. Just keep doing. You got to tell me something I don't know. I got to get home. - I'll walk you out. - Oh, come on, man. You guys, seriously, keep dancing, you're great. I gotta go. You have to walk me, I'm not going to have to... It's just, thank you, man, thank you, this is great. - Dude, it was great. - It was, man, I'm fucking... - I'm glad you got fired today. - Me too. I like it. I like it. Yeah, you're not going to go... - No, no, no, I'm good. - No, listen to me, I don't want you stumbling around out there. I am not gonna stumble. Clearly, no. Simon Brandon I'm good, I got my shoes on. - All right. - Okay? Yes. - Thanks, man. - Thank you for coming. Ugh. - You're a part of the tribe now. - Thank you. - I mean that. - Glad to be part of it. - You're in. - Thank you. - Yeah, man. - Good night, Richard. Good night, man. Wait, wait, that's not the one. Hold on, wait, wait, wait, stop, stop. Okay, this is the la... Okay, one more, one more, one more, one more, hold on... What? Oh. Bruce was an adorable cat, and that's coming from a dog person. - Can I ask you a question? - Shoot. Do you want another beer? Mm? Do you want another beer? I had reached my limit. Oh, God, can I ask you one more question? Go ahead. Why didn't you ever remarry, or how come you never got another dog? I don't know. Things you keep putting off, you know. I used to say to myself... I'll get around to it... but then time passes and life passes. You just... You just never do. You know, um... You know, I came here, because of my mom. Mm. She was in a nursing home not far from here, she was, um... I mean, she had kind of lost it mentally, but I guess I just wanted... I guess I just wanted to be near her, because it was just us, there was... there was nobody else. Mm. And... Well, anyway, she passed two years ago. And I always just thought that I would move somewhere that I would have done something, Oh, my God, but I just never did. Home is home. Mm. Yeah. I guess I got comfortable here, or I guess I like it. Uh... Home is home. You were here for your mother, when she really needed you. Think about that. My wife and I... ...we never had any kids. I didn't want any, uh, and that was okay with her. But now that I think back on it... that was one of the biggest mistakes I ever made in my life. You were here for your mom's when she really needed you... Think about that. Ian... Mmm? I think I'll go to bed now. You can come with me. I mean... I mean, you can come with me, if you want the company. Okay? I think I want the company. - It's late, we got to go. - I know, but just a little bit more. Let's finally do it. - Not tonight. - I know. - Soon. - Yeah. - Not tonight. - I know. I know. Hey. - Who is that? - I don't know. He's hammered. - All right, I'll gonna go. - Okay, oh, have a good night. - Okay. - Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. - Be careful, bye. - Yeah. Hey. - Hey. - What? I think there's someone in the kitchen? What do you mean? I think there's someone out there. It could be Natalie. Or it can be the fucking pet killer, you idiot. Go to Natalie's room right now, call 911. Get there. Hey! Oh, fuck. Sorry, man, wrong house. - Get out of here. - I'm going. - It's okay. - Out. - Hey, easy, man. - Sue, call the police. -Don't do that, I'm leaving. - Are you the guy killing people's pets? - What are you talking about? What are you doing breaking into other people's fucking house? I am not breaking, it's an accident, man. You're staying until the cops come. - Stop. - You just stop, man. Are you crazy? You stabbed me. Sue, get in here, keep Natalie in the room. Listen to me, my wife's a nurse, so just keep calm. - Who is he? - Why did you stab me? I... don't know. What the fuck did you do? - It was an accident. - Jesus. Okay, listen to me, I just called 911, someone is on their way, stay calm. Pss-pss. Pss-pss. Pss-pss. Pss-pss. Marney, I know this sounds strange... and I really don't understand it myself. But after last night... something came over me and... I can't even put it in words. But it just put me in another place. I see you coming and going all the time... and that feeling has probably been with me all that time. I'm in love. That's all I can say. Marney. - Morning, Ian. - There's something I got to tell you. Look, I, uh, I wasn't really in my right mind last night, there's a lot of things going on up there, so see you around. See you around. I got myself into this mess. - Okay, okay, okay, cool. - Breakfast. We need to go. - When did you get up? - Oh, yes, but I'll split. - I got to go. - Why? Uh, 'cause it's time. It's time, you don't even know what time it is. - Yeah. - It's breakfast time. - Have some breakfast. - All right. A little touch of eggs and bacon on me to feel. Well, that was very nice, but we're done. - I would have better... - Come on. It smells good, you're a good host. - All right. - School day. - School day. - Yeah, I know. Come on, man, that's so nice. This is my fucking mom, dude. - Mom, mom, mom, see you. - What does that even mean, man? Do you have any idea how lucky you are? That knife didn't slice your liver open... and the nurse was able to stop your bleeding. Bought a bag of weed last night. Oh, very cool. You'll need to start to act to your age, I know that sounds really dull, but you're gonna be a dad any day now. I know. I'm sorry. Did you ever go out last night? - No. - Why not? Stayed home playing video games. I was going to go out, but my legs were too tired, it would be nice. So did you see the news this morning, dude? No. It was weird, it was like, this guy was like... They named him like, the pet killer and I guess he was killing pets or whatever, and he got caught, somebody beat him up or something. It was weird, I never seen anything like that. - You didn't hear about it? - No. Early this morning, a man in his late 30s was found dead on the sidewalk of Willow Glen Drive, authorities say he could be related to the string of pet slangs in the neighborhood, as a bloody pocket knife was discovered in his jacket. How's it going? - Can I go out now? - Yeah, honey, it's all good. Hey. - So, have you guys decided? - Decided what, honey? Where we'll keep Polly? We'll put her right next to the window here. That way, she can look outside, but still be safe inside. Good morning. Nice day, huh?
