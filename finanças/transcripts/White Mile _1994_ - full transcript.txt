Yeah, that's it! Left turn, left turn, take it in, come on! Head on down! Whoo! Looks good! That's it, power on! OK, here we come, A nice big left run coming up! Keep it going! Keep it going! Dig in! Keep it going! Fabulous! You guys, here we go again! ♪ OK, so the single most compelling idea, what is it? Comfort. They fit...your feet. No! Old people want comfort, kids want omnipotence. You wear these, all your problems are solved. Emotion, emotion. Well, speaking for myself, personally, wearing these sneakers has solved all my problems. But how do we show that? Look, we've got four hours 'til dawn. Two hours to go home, change and shave and we'll still have two hours before we present this to Dan. And we'll have the afternoon to look for new careers. He's frustrated, he's off his rhythm. And the other players aren't that hard to beat. In his mind, they turn into nuns, school girls with uniforms! He's having a really bad day. Then he remembers his Adidas. He puts them on during a time out. Suddenly, he's up against gigantic guys. He is flying through the air, he's dunking shots. Then the tag line Adidas, they give you that extra lift. What do you think? Basketball players turn into nuns? I know, it's terrible, forget it, we haven't slept. You do that with a dissolve? A dissolve, a cut-- it's fantasy. We have Danny Manning or maybe we have Danny Manning? Yes. Maybe. We'll know tomorrow. The client is gonna want a specific shot that says "comfort". Oh, Danny Manning puts on his Adidas and then we see this incredible look of comfort flooding his face. There, boom. Obvious. I don't want to offend Catholics. The nuns are gonna be treated with absolute respect. People are gonna have great recall on this. Danny Manning and the nuns. And the nuns. I don't like celebrity endorsements. How do we know he won't do something in his private life to hurt the product? Andy, this is a man of the utmost integrity. I recommend we go with it. How would the nun part work? Box out now, box out! Come on! Here we go! Watch the base, watch the base! Come on! Here we go! Got it! Good rebound, sister! let's go again, right away! What did Thornell say, exactly? He said the commercial is better than it was before. Those are his exact words? He said it's better now, yeah. Because if those were his exact words we're fucked, he hates it. How is it? I don't think the client is happy. OK, good rehearsal! I have this feeling he's putting us in review. Oh, yeah? He's a $20 million account. He is not putting us in review. I'm gonna show this tape to the guys at the meeting tomorrow. You're gonna see sheer terror on those faces. What is it? It's our next trip. It just came in from the Canadian guide. It's great, the boat's bouncing all over the place, the guy nearly loses the camera. They're gonna shit. You don't want to ever go to, like, Kauai? Kauai, yeah, that's great. We can really test ourselves negotiating our way through the lobby. Andy! Believe me, Andy, we'll take care of it. OK, OK, OK. How we doing? OK. These two young guys worked very hard on this. Do you think we have a problem? You know what it is, I feel like there's this big hole where Nick Karas used to be. Let me tell you something. Art Stefanoff and David Koenig are two of the brightest young guys we've got. Otherwise I wouldn't have given them Nick's accounts. Nick was a friend, it wasn't easy for me to hear he was off my account. Andy, he retired. Yeah, I know. Andy, we miss Nick a lot but he's moved on and we have to move on, too. You know what I mean! Well, I think I understand all this pretty well, Jack. I mean, as I recall, Nick hired you, didn't he? Yes, he did. I seem to remember that. Andy. Let me get you together with them, all right? These are very bright guys. Sure. And if you're not happy, then we'll work something out, OK? Is that fair? Nothing would make me happier. Nothing would make him happier. You know what that means? Review. Who are you calling? Nick Karas, I need some advice. Kill the nuns. Right, kill the nuns. Just make him nervous, it's too far out. Plain, ordinary basketball players, guys. And kill the school girls, too. Anytime, anytime. Hello? Yes, one second, please. It's Thornell. I love how retired you are. Hi, Andy. Yeah? No, no, I think you're right. Yeah, kill them. The main thing is the shoes. If you were selling nuns it would be a different story. It's all right, I'm glad to be of help, Andy. OK, thank you, thank you, nuns. Thank you, ladies. You did a wonderful job, all right, thank you. I hope that appeases him. This is not a happy guy, Dan. He is not fucking dropping us, he's our client. He goes when I tell him he can. Let's put him on the list for the Canada trip. You think he'll go? Yeah, he'll go. And you know what? Let's put Nick Karas on the list, too. You don't have a problem with Karas? No, why would I have a problem with him? You invite Thornell, I'll call Karas... I can't wait to see those faces. Rehearsal right away. This is where some of us are going next month. It's an hour's flight north of Vancouver. It's called the Chilko river. And this, right here, that's known as the "White Mile". Holy shit. When I got this job I was charged with doubling our billings in four years. We did better than that. We went from 153 million to 400 million. And I had a great time doing it. This is fun for me. If you're not having fun, you shouldn't be here. You know what I'm hearing now? I'm starting to hear fear. Fear of losing your talent, losing your clients. "What did he say, how did he say it?" You start working from the fear of losing, you lose. This is not gonna happen, guys. Why do you think we take these trips? Anybody have any idea? Marty, why are we going on this trip? Well, frankly, Dan, I think these trips are one of the best things you've done for this company. After we've slept out on the ground with them, cooked the fish we've caught together, they're not just clients anymore, they're like family. Yeah, so in other words, it's a way of cementing relations. Yeah, well, that happens. What's it really about? You don't really know, do you? This trip is to get your balls back. The stakes are very high in this business. When they're this high what do you think makes the difference? Hard work? Everybody works hard. No, you know who wins? The guy who can walk up to you in the school yard look you right in the eye and say, "I want your lunch." You got to be able to go into the wilderness with nothing but a knife and a little nerve and come out not just having survived it, you come out owning it. You want to keep this client? You take him by the throat, you hold him to your chest until you can feel his heart beating and you say, "You're mine, pal. "From now on, you don't want what you want, You want what I want." That's what this trip is about. Jesus, this guy's a pisser. So who's he taking on that river? You, David and me. I haven't been here that long. You think I actually need to get my balls back? I'm a little nervous. Don't worry, you'll do fine. He couldn't be happier with David's work. Just relax. Dan! This is Diane Koenig. Hi, I'm Dan cutler. Hi, it's nice to meet you. We'll get together. Art and I, and you and David. Great, I'd like that. Thanks, Michelle. Come on in. Can I offer you anything? A cup of coffee, a Perrier? No, I'm fine, thanks. Here, have a seat over here. Is anything wrong, Mr. Cutler? Oh, no, I should've had Michelle explain. I just like to meet with the spouse of anybody new here. I see. You know, so we can get to know one another. It's a big adjustment, you know, new city, new friends. There are a lot of pressures in this business, too. I know David had to work all through the night a few times on this Adidas thing. It can get to you sometimes. Well, David likes to work hard. Oh, David's terrific. We're all crazy about him here. I just want to make sure you're happy, too. You guys are a team. So how are you coming with the house hunting? Well, we found a place that we like and we're just about ready to close. Can I help on that? I'm a pretty good negotiator. Well, if we have a problem-- What about you, what are your plans? I know you were teaching back East. Well, I thought that once we got settled I'd look around. You know what? My wife plays bridge with a couple of people on the school board. I'm gonna have her call you, just to get acquainted, OK? Well, thanks, that's very nice. Anything we can do to help, really, I mean it. I'm glad you came in. Thanks, nice to meet you. You, too. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Michelle? Well, she's a tough cookie. Well, if he starts complaining about the hours or the working conditions-- yeah, right, it'll be coming from her. Hold it--what? I just spoke to Thornell, he'd love to come on the Chilko trip. Good, Karas is all set, too. We still have that release form from that trip we took a couple of years ago? I need a bunch of copies, legal ones. All right, let me look. Michelle? Ah, she'll be all right. Just keep your eye on her, all right? Right. ♪ The trips are led by experienced rafting guides who have seasons of experiences with Miller Tours, Inc. Conditioning and safety are top priority... So we have to decide is it college players versus Danny Manning or Cub Scouts? That's good. Tiny Cub Scouts. Do we want actors, do we want-- I want to say bye. Hi! Hi, Diane. Hi, Jack. How'd it go with Dan? Ah, sort of weird, but basically fine. Ohh, good. Do you have an hour for me, angel? Could you pick up a sleeping bag at this place on Ventura? Yeah, sure. Hey, you need a place to crash? You know, we just bought a whole house. No, it's for me. But thank you. Dan's taking some of us to Canada next month. Kind of an outdoor get-together with some of our clients. Hmm, you, outdoors? No way. It's corporate bonding, stuff like that. You're gonna catch pneumonia, you'll get lost. I got to go, it's part of the deal. Snake bite is? Are you going on this trip? Oh, I've been here too long, it seems sane to me. Wouldn't it be nice if the job was just this? Really. Mmm, bye. Bye-bye! Bye, Jack. Love you. He's just tying one last fly. I'll get him. Great! I don't want you to open this until you are wading in a river, all right? It's a surprise. A surprise? What is it? Oh, a little something for your trip. But you got to promise to use it. What did you get me? I'm not telling you. Socks? I'm not saying. Extra warm electric socks? Uh-uh. Condoms? Oh, you wish. Electric condoms? I have to tell you, you are getting real cold. Hey... you're not upset because I'm leaving, are you? Oh, please... I've got plenty to do while you're gone. They've got steelhead trout, I've always wanted to go up there. No, really? You carry pictures of fish in your wallet. You think normal men do that? I only carry pictures of you, babe! Oh, yeah? Holding a fish. Hey, Jack! We don't see too much of you anymore. I know, we got to do something about that. Let's have dinner when we get back. You be sure to put that in your book now, huh? That's a promise. Promises, promises. I didn't know you fished! Just try not to get the hooks caught in your pants, Jack. What do you say, Art? Hey! How you doing? Where's Dan? He's gonna meet us in Vancouver. He and David are taking a different route. David Koenig, as in my co-replacement? He's a good guy, Nick. That's nice. What's the drill? Chilko Lake by charter, two days R and R, then home. See you in a couple of days, babe! ♪ So who's going with us? well, Dave Koenig and Dan, of course. Uh-huh, who else? Pete Wiederhorn. Oh, yeah. Big dog at Merrill lynch, right? Right, right. And jerry Taggart, C.G. and L., you know him. Yeah, we had a good time on the last trip. Who else? Tom Horton from Wells Rich. A little superior, but not a bad guy. And...Andy Thornell. My assignment, should I accept it is to crawl in Andy's sleeping bag at night, right? Exactly. You know, I think there's a good chance we're gonna have a great time up here. I hope for nothing, I fear nothing, I am free. How's that? It's all Greek, a writer. That was his philosophy... his epitaph, too. Hey, David! Say hello to your predecessor! This is Nick Karas. Hi, Nick, I'm David Koenig. I've heard a lot about you, a lot of beautiful things. Hello, David. Good to meet you. Nice to meet you. Thanks. Jack, you want to hand out the release forms? I got 'em. Andy? Release forms? Yep, here. Jerry, take a look. David. What is this, in case we lose our credit cards? Hey, Pete. Dan? Yeah. Release from what? It's a lawyer thing. Just sign it and we can get out of here. The legal department asked for it, don't worry about it. Look 'em over, I'll collect them later. Who's not here yet? Spencer, he should be here any minute. Did Dan say anything about rafting when he invited you? Rafting, yeah. Yeah. Whoa, look who's here! Bill Spencer! I don't believe it! An hour out of Cleveland I realized I haven't packed my gear. Thank god there was a sports store just down the road. Oh, I'm glad you made it. Here's a release. A zillion and a half dollars in his budget and the guy leaves home without his fishing tackle. Chilko lodge group? Yeah, that's us. Come on! Get the luggage in. Deluxe accommodations. Welcome aboard! Watch your step. Are there phones where we're going? Beats me. What's the plan, Dan? Are we sleeping out tonight? No, we're staying at the lodge. Tomorrow we have a choice of fishing or floating. On Saturday, everybody floats. Go down through Lava Canyon. We'll meet the plane here, we'll come back here. We all float on Saturday? Well, we're all on this rafting trip here, I presume we're all floating, yeah. Any more questions? Yeah, could you have the plane stop at 45th Street? You plan to float the Chilko? That's white-water, isn't it? Yeah. Have you got a guide? A guide who knows the river? Yes, I do. Yeah. He's only rafted this river 200 times, so we may have to take a cab part of the way, but, yes, it did occur to me to get a guide, yeah. ♪ Feels like camp. Great, huh? I'll have to call my mother. I've got two questions when do we eat and who's cooking? Not us. We've got a couple of young women, a couple of guides. Great cooks, really great. All right! This is great! Ralph, Ralph Mozart. Now I'm at 30. What are we? Are we the big ones or the little ones? We're solids. Who's playing this game with me? So, you do it on top of the oven for how long? For how long? Just until you get it brown and then you can put 'em in the oven-- Hey, please, Jerry! And then make a white wine reduction sauce. This is the wrong guy to ask? The wrong guy to ask about... No, I'm absolutely the right guy to ask. I don't mean wrong in the-- In a pejorative way. You mean wrong in the nice way. He's the wrong guy, yeah! "I mean that in a good way." What do we have to do here? Jack? You better stick to advertising. Leave a number, and the you... Pete. One more. Ed, hi. Good morning, Mr. Cutler. This our boat here? Well, we've got a couple we can choose from. Are you ready? I thought we were gonna get going a little sooner. How many is in your group? Today, half a dozen. Tomorrow, everybody goes, 10 of us. Well, today, if you've got six, I've got a couple German tourists who want to go down. We can put 'em all in one boat? No, wait a second, wait a minute. You want to mix tourists in with my guys? Why can't the tourists have their own raft? Well, I suppose they could, but-- No, let me explain something to you. Just listen to this. We can do it, I mean, it's-- Well, it's one thing to say you can do it but I don't think I've made an impression... Yeah, OK. Are you ready? I thought we were gonna be going a little sooner than this. It'll just be a few more minutes. Are you--I mean-- is this gonna be-- do we have an understanding about this group? Other trips we're gonna take? Are we clear about this? Yeah. OK, we're all set. Let's get the guys out here who are rafting today. What about Karas? He doesn't want to float. He wants to fish today. OK, and I think you want to fish today, too. Right. I want to get going, as soon as Miller gets his stuff together. Whenever the hell that's gonna be. How bad is it, Steph? What we've got here is your basic mud puddle. Aw, man. What are you doing, wait a minute, what's that? It's a come-along. Put it around that tree over there and we'll be out of here in a couple of minutes. No, no, no, forget that stuff. I'll take care of this. Put it away, put it away. All right, David. Present! Get some of those dead branches over there. Stick 'em under the wheel. Here we go. I can do, I can do. Pete. Wiederhorn! Yo! See if you can find some sand or gravel or something, stick it in the mud there. You got it, pal. What the hell's that sand gonna do for that mud? I don't know, but it's gonna do a hell of a lot for Wiederhorn. Yeah, rocks. You get some rocks. Pete! Come on, branches, let's go, let's go! Let's do it, come on! You go over here, I'm gonna go down here... No, come on, everybody, together, all right? All right! One, two, three! Heave! Heave! Heave! Woo! Woo woo woo woo! Ha ha! Good work, guys! Hey, I thought you guys were gonna wait for me to bring the, uh, the sticks back. Nick, you think this kind of fishing is ever really gonna catch on in a big way? Man, excuse me. Sorry, I got it. There are about a billion people in the country who think so. I got it, I got it! I got it. The fish is gonna reel you unless you get that attached properly. I got it. Here, I just got it a little turned around... I got to get the touch you have with this thing. You just have to do it a lot, that's all. Sometimes when Gena watches me pack, she sees the fly rod go in, she starts pounding her head like this. Oh, that reminds me. I promised her I'd use her gift out here. Let's see what we got. Hey. All right! Ha ha ha! A thing of beauty. Who needs to fish, with a hat like this? It's you, it's you, it's you! Yeah? Forget it! She kills me. You miss the day-to-day stuff? I know you were very close to Thornell. You really think he might pull the account? You think maybe I should talk to him? You know, that would be a great idea. Jack, I don't want to embarrass you, but you're positioning me, aren't you? Yeah. Yeah. Ha ha ha! Yeah... You know what I've learned, going from river to river? Sometimes... the fish are where you think they are, and sometimes they're where they're not supposed to be. So you have to sort of develop your own instinct, your own style. Otherwise, you'll always be where the fish are not. I'll give you the book on Thornell. He's a decent guy. He's honest. And if you try to pressure him... he'll walk. You know, we were meant to live in the wilderness. Our bodies crave fresh air. Tom, stop, I'll be crying in a minute. Food caught with your own hands... You're stinking up the wilderness with that cigar. Sleeping under the sky in a boat... I was not meant to live in the wilderness. You know, they did a study that says that sleeping under the sky with a book over your face can actually help your immune system? Put a book up your ass, I'm trying to rest here. Well, look who's here, the royal Canadian navy. How many made it? One, two, three, four, five... That's the idea. Pete, how was the river? Oh, forget the river, the drive back was a killer. Half my spine is up in my skull. Class-5 rapids in the river, class-6 bumps in the road. Hey, you should've been with us. You should see this girl with an oar! No, no, no way you're getting me on the water. Tomorrow I fish, today I slept. No, tomorrow you got to come with us. I told him! Oh yeah, you got to. Yes? You know what this class-5 and class-6 stuff is? I mean, what it means, because-- River talk! Yeah. As far as I'm concerned, Nick, you have to go a long way before you beat the classics. Here. Take a look at this. Now, this is a classic. Yeah. If you're talking classic, take a look at this. The royal coachman. Oh, yeah! Oh, that's the one you were telling me about. Beautiful! This dry fly has caught more trout than any dry fly in the history of fishing. And it looks like it, yeah. Compare this, Jack, to the kind of thing that's going on today. Why, I bet the fish can spot that a mile away. Yes, they can. They can spot it a mile away because it's all tinsel and flash. Do fish like that? Las Vegas fish like that. It happens every time, I get a parking ticket. Nick, you made that? That I did. There's no justice. Who gets justice? People get what they can pay for. Well, that's a pretty broad statement. No, I studied this in college. They told you in college there's no justice? What college did you go to? Maybe I can help out here. Please! This is what we were talking about before. I was trying to explain that I think justice is irrelevant. Your pro bono cases... ♪ OK, let's go! Spencer, wake up Wiederhorn! Tell him he's having the time of his life. Spencer! Spencer's asleep. Well, give 'em both a shot. David, leave your stuff here. You won't need anything that's not in the boat. Come on. Dan, what's the deal here? What's the deal? We're going rafting, that's what we came up here for. Because I could happily hang around the lodge and fish all day today. You came all this way to hang around the lodge? Nick, let's go, a little hustle! Set an example for the younger ones. What, it was a joke. Yeah, was it? What, you a little cranky until you get your Ovaltine in the morning? Are you needling me? No, I'm not needling you. Yes, you are. Why do you do that? Do you enjoy that? Tell you what, let's get in the boat. We can do group therapy on the way home. Let's be straight with each other for a minute. Why don't you let up, Dan, I'm not a threat to you. Relax. You know, I always admired how relaxed you were. You had perspective, you had distance. I guess I'd rather stay in the game. Well, if you want to play games, first find out if anybody wants to play. What is your problem today?! Come on. You guys up for this? I'm up for this. Let's go. Watch it! I got it! It's quite a Viking thing! OK, everybody, for those of you who didn't go down the river with us yesterday, this is a Sotar inflatable raft. It's got a couple very important features, one of which is that it's a paddle boat. But you, all of you are the power behind the boat, and we'll be needing that power in order to avoid obstacles as we head on down the river... You mean, we're all gonna get into that? We won't all fit in there. I'll be sitting in the back of the raft, steering and ruddering as we head on down the river. I'll also be yelling different commands... Dan. You think one boat's enough? Usually they'd use two rafts for a group this size. Ah, probably not important. If we had to have two, we would've brought two. Let's just make the best of it. OK, everybody, go ahead and finish putting on your life jackets, cinch 'em up tight and come on down. what'd he say about weight distribution? I, uh, don't think he said anything. OK, I'll be right back. Can you, uh, can you explain this class thing to me, like what is class-3? Class-3 is what we did yesterday. Right. That's how they rate the rapids, on a scale of 1 to 6. Today we'll be hitting some class-4 and class-5. Right, so... so what is class-6? Class-6 is basically unnavigable. OK, boys. Come on, let's get in, let's do it. If we're going, let's go. You know, I don't want to do this. If you don't want to do it say no. Well, how rough is it? I don't know what the hell's going on out there any more than you do. I'll be OK, huh? OK, 5, 6, 7, 8, let's do this. OK, let's go forward. We come in peace! It was good, it was good. Even cadence. OK, we're gonna practice a few of our strokes. When I say, "left turn," the left side back paddles, the right side goes forward. OK, left turn! Dig it in, left turn! Looking good! What, do we just copy the person in front of us? Exactly. OK, right turn! Right side back paddles. Will there be cocktails on this flight? OK, left turn. Left turn. You got a whole new career ahead of you. I think I've got a hernia! All the way around!

No, I got out about an eighth of a mile back down that way. We saw Nick and Art, they were in the water-- Stop, stop! Let's go, let's go! See anything? Over there! Get over there, get over there! The far side, over there! Come on! Base, this is chopper 3, approaching Skinner's Falls. Over. There, right there! We have three survivors right there! Base, this is chopper 3, we've sighted three survivors. Over. Roger, chopper 3. People, move to the clearing ahead of you, one quarter mile south. Over there! Right, right over there, over there! Oh, my God. Can you see? Who is it? It's Spencer. Come and help me! No, no, leave him here. Why? We take the time now, they'll all be dead. Get in the boat, come on, get in the boat! Maybe he had a bad heart. A bad heart? Well, what was it, what happened?! These rapids had me for almost an hour. I'm 55. You're telling me a younger man wouldn't have made it if he was healthy? God, everybody knows how to swim. Chilko's not a swimming hole. Just row the fucking boat. Base, this is chopper 3, we're arriving at the takeout, over. Paramedics, we have one injured. Three on board, clear the area. Prepare to unload. OK, they're down! Chopper 3, this is base. Stand by for instructions. over. We got a bruise here! Maybe some broken ribs, some hypothermia! What about the others? How many have you found? They didn't all make it, sir! They didn't all make it. I've got to get the bags. I've got to get the bags. Are you all right? Help the others. Looks like you got some broken ribs, but your lungs sound clear. They don't seem to be punctured. Pete, Andy, I got your bags. Why don't you guys go on ahead, huh? Hold the tow line, hold it. Good, now let it up easy now. Hold it down there. Who is it?! Who is it?! We found three so far. Oh! Bring it back up. Hold the tow line, watch the spin. ♪ He doesn't look so good, bring a stretcher. Are you OK? It's good to see you, are you OK? Did you see anybody? Sp-sp-- Spencer, Spencer. It's all right, it's all right. I'm all right. Hey, Dan-- Wiederhorn and Thornell, they're here, they're OK. Did you see Art? Or David? Dan? Did you see Nick? Dan, what about the others, did you see anybody? Sir, I need you to stand back and just give us some room, all right? Just relax a bit. We'll get you to the hospital. I had Karas in my hands. I was looking in his face, you know? I could see his eyes. Then I just lost him. The river just took him away. That goddamned rock. Fucking fuck! Shit! Inspector Costello. I'm sorry, but we need for you to identify the bodies of these five gentlemen. OK. Did you and your friends have any rafting experience? Some of us did. That's David Koenig. Did anyone instruct you on how to handle yourselves in the rapids on this trip? Um, not much. Horton... Tom Horton. There was some instruction. The Chilko's a pretty powerful river. That's, that's Art Stefanoff. Bill Spencer. 11 men... that's a lot to have in one raft. Nick Karas. Is your knee hurting, Dan? No, it's fine. How are you? Maybe you ought to ask them to give you a pill. Do you want me to make the calls to the families? No, I'll call them. You go back home. Make sure people don't fall apart. You know, there's a lesson here. I didn't motivate them enough. If I'd just built a fire under them, we wouldn't be here now. I let myself down, you know? You were great out there, Jack, you ought to be proud of yourself. Kauai, yeah, that's great. We can really test ourselves negotiating our way through the lobby. I can't wait to see those faces. ♪ Welcome back, chief. It's good to see you. Yes, we've missed you. Good morning! Hi, Alma. Didn't realize you'd be on a cane. Were you badly hurt? No, a couple of weeks and I'll be fine. Anything I should know? Marty wants to see you when you have time for him. Tell him to come in. And Diane Koenig is in the building to pick up a check. She asked if she could see you on her way out. Thought you'd want to see her. Yeah, it'll be OK. Set up lunch for you at your desk. You got me that cheesecake. Welcome home. Thanks. Marty? He can see you now. I thought I'd wait until you got back to work before I hit you with it. I have to tell you, Marty, I find this hard to believe. Who filed the suit? The company is being sued by Gena Karas. Now, you're not a defendant, but they are holding the corporation responsible for your actions. And Ed Miller's. Gena Karas. She has no case. Nick signed that release, everybody did. Well, there are problems with the release. The wording was pretty vague... they should have been issued before the trip. It's probably invalid. That's great... I saw Nick's face this close to me, seconds before he drowned. I can still see his eyes. I'd have given my life to have saved him. Dan, I know you know this, but you can't let this get to you personally. Look, I understand her bitterness. I understand that. Letting somebody destroy me is not gonna bring him back. Well, just thought I'd let you know what was happening. Yeah, good, thanks. Diane, please, come in. I'm very sorry. Please, have a seat. I'm just finishing up some lunch. Alma got me a piece of the best cheesecake in the city. You want to have a little with me? No, thank you. It's pretty good. I haven't been able to eat very much lately. Diane, what you should know about David's death is that it was very sudden. We didn't see that rock until the last second. Then we were caught up in this amazing swirl of water. Well, thanks. I guess it helps to know that. Did they have a check for you? Yeah. $5,055.72. Well, that ought to help a little. Yeah. I'm really grateful for that 72 cents. Diane, I'm sure no one could miss David as much as his wife can. That's right. ♪ Dan, how are you? I've been looking at that stuff you did on the bank. You got it! Yeah, you liked it? I made one or two little changes, but you got it. Jesus, that's fine work. Thank you. You got right back on the horse, didn't you? Everybody else around here is in a coma. You've really risen to this. You took over on the river when I was in too much shock to even know what I was doing. I realize how much I rely on you. I don't rely on many people, you know? You comfortable in here? You get all that afternoon sun. Talk to Marty, you might as well take the corner office on the north side. I couldn't take David's office, Dan. No, take it. We got to move on, kid. I need you to. ♪ How is it, you like it? Thank you. Let some light in, it's dismal in here. It is hard, isn't it? For everybody. Gena must be going through hell. Yeah. She must be out of her head. She wouldn't have brought that suit if she were thinking clearly. Maybe you ought to talk to her. What would I say? Help her understand it isn't in her best interest. I don't have to tell you what to say. I'd really feel uncomfortable talking to her about the suit. Suit? No, uh-uh. No, she's going through a very difficult time. Be supportive. Dan, I'm sorry, I can't do that. You can't do that? Maybe it is in her best interests. Well, whatever you think is right. You know, I'm asking you to help her not do something that would waste her money with no chance of bringing him back. I'm not asking you to do anything disloyal to anybody. I'm asking you to be loyal. Is there any reason you can't do that? Hmm? Hello, Jack. Gena, I'm so sorry. Thank you for your letter, it was really thoughtful. Would you like to come in? I don't want to disturb you. I just... Let's walk. Sure. You know, I admired him tremendously. He was a wise person, such a core of decency. He was very funny. He used to do these imitations of me. Really made me laugh. I couldn't get mad at him. It's funny what you miss. Here we were a few weeks ago, piling into that car... and now-- Jack, I have to ask you something. Don't suffer at me, OK? I can't carry your pain, too. I'm sorry. You're gonna have to forgive yourself. You're right. You know... people have been coming to see me. They have these really warm words about Nick and condolences for me, and then there'll be this little pause and they tell me I have to put Nick's death behind me... and that I don't really have a chance. Is this one of those pauses? No, I won't tell you that. You've been through enough. Well, yeah, I have. The pause was about something else. Suppose I testified. Your lawyers took my deposition. Maybe they'd like me to take the stand. Oh, I don't think so. Why not? Because I think you really want me to say no, don't you? This is the best yet-- an actual offer of help. Sounded real good there, Jack. I'll tell you what, you got a pen? Yeah. This is my lawyer's number. If you actually feel this way tomorrow, give him a call. ♪ I'm telling you, this is a very, very difficult client. SECOND You're selling me. Do the research and sell the client. This commercial is very high profile... Why are you doing this? These things don't happen in a vacuum, Jack. As soon as you contacted them, they contacted us. They're obligated to! So far, all I did was call them, Marty. You realize that if we lose this suit Dan will almost surely have to step down? Maybe leave the company, you understand that? Marty, I'm just trying to figure out what's the right thing to do. The fact is, they don't even need you. They have an expert witness. Leslie Wayne Bechdel. The guy wrote a book about river rafting. What can you possibly add to what he's gonna say? ♪ You still have time to reconsider, Jack. I wish you'd think about it. Good night. I feel like I've got a few things I need to square with you, Jack. Sure. First of all, I'm very aware that when you pulled me into that boat I had about another three minutes left on Earth. Andy, you would've done the same thing for me. Secondly, I'm sure it's no surprise, we're moving our account. No, it's no surprise at all. I'm glad you told me personally. OK, now I have to ask you something. It's been bugging me for a couple of weeks. How ashamed is anybody over there about what happened? Everybody's taken it pretty hard. Do you think taking it hard is good enough? Look, I know why we went on that trip together. You weren't positioning the client? Sure we were. That wasn't the only thing the trip was about. No? Did your company write any of it off as a business-related expense? Dan handled that. Well, maybe you should talk to the accountants and maybe you can tell me that taking it "pretty hard" is good enough. Andy, we've been rocked by this. I'm thinking of testifying for Gena. You're thinking about it? I don't know if I have anything worth getting up there and saying, I don't have any hard evidence that could clinch it for her. There's no point in an empty gesture. If there's something you could say that could possibly help her, then, goddamn it, say it. These cases aren't decided by some crucial piece of evidence. You don't have to go in with a smoking gun, all right? All you have to do is have the nerve to stand up when your turn comes and tell the goddamn truth the way you know it. Andy, why are you beating me up about this? Because I'm helpless. When I saw Tom Horton's body floating by me his head looked like something inanimate, like a melon. He was already half dead, not 30 seconds before he was joking about how wet his socks were. Now listen to me, Peggy Horton can't explain this to their 2-year-old because he can't talk. He doesn't know where his father went. He's never gonna know where he went. So if you have anything you can do, anything, then do it! Do it! Mr. Bechdel, do you have any opinions concerning the conduct of Burrows-McCain, the defendant in this case? Yes, I do. What are your opinions, sir? Well, the first thing is that they should not have invited Mr. Karas along in the first place. He had no experience. In fact, he didn't even think he was coming along on a white-water trip. He thought it was going to be a fishing trip. You do not take a novice on the Lava Canyon. Well, when he asked me about this and told me that he'd always wanted to fish there my comment was, "So go." had there been any mention by Nick of that trip involving anything other than fishing? No. Did the words "white-water rafting" ever come up? No. He certainly wanted to go on that trip. And he knew it was white-water rafting. What else is it about Burrows-McCain's conduct that you believe was wrong in this case? Well, it became apparent to me after reading the literature provided to me that Mr. Cutler put a lot of pressure on Mr. Miller to make this an exclusive trip. He didn't want any strangers on this trip, which made Mr. Miller run a single raft trip. Well now, shouldn't Miller have insisted that he go on two rafts? Yes, he should have. In my classes, I talk about the need to be forceful and to sometimes say no, even though it might displease some people. If you're going to compromise safety, there's a time that you have to say no. Now, ladies and gentlemen, the next witness will be presented to you by way of a videotape deposition. For reasons of geography, the witness is unable to be here, but I instruct you that you should consider the videotape deposition in the same manner that you would consider any other testimony by a live witness. Well, that morning, Ed said, "Why don't you--you better just go on down ahead." And we didn't discuss it then but, you know, later on, in later discussions with Ed we talked about the idea of the single boats. And he kind of said that he felt a little pressure to keep it an exclusive trip. All aboard! Hey, hey, hey. Hey, here comes a boat. Hey, buddy, come on over! Taxi! We could use some help here! No more sardines here, pal. When that order was given to Ed Miller, Ed Miller and I had an agreement. And in order for us to put our compatible group together there would be, roughly, 10 of us, and we wouldn't be mixed in with another group of strangers. I did not put pressure on him! Mr. Wiederhorn, did you, shortly after the accident make some notes to yourself on that trip? I'm gonna show you plaintiff's exhibit 113. Would you, uh, would you read that, sir? What does it say? "No safety instructions." Thank you, Mr. Wiederhorn. He gave us the instructions when we were gathered there as he was checking the vests and before we pushed off. The first time was before we put in, when he was getting everybody into the rafts... when we were going out. How long did that take? I would guess no more than a couple of minutes. The longer one occurred above Bidwell? Yeah. He told you if you go in the water, get your feet in front of you. Is that right? He said, "when I say go to the high side, go to the high side fast." That's gonna help prevent the boat from flipping over. Thank you. The court stands in recess for one hour. How you bearing up on this? Oh, OK. How are you doing? I'm kind of enjoying it. Come on. Might as well. Another adventure, you know? Have a seat. Today's the day, huh? Yeah. You ready to testify? You know you know when someone's in a position like this where anything you might say could hurt a friend, the only thing you can do is tell the truth. Hey, come on, of course. I guess I'm wondering how you'll color it. Color it? Color it, what will it sound like? What flavor is it gonna have? The truth doesn't have flavors, I'm just gonna go in there and tell them what I saw and what I heard. You can say the same thing in a lot of different ways, Jack. You know that as well as I do. We do that for a living. This isn't a product we're selling, it's the truth. Yeah? You self-righteous little prick. I fought for my life in that water just like everybody else. You're telling me I abused these people? I suffered as much as anybody who made it. And I can't call back the ones who didn't. I'm not God, Jack. Are you? What were you doing, Dan? What does that mean? Taking everyone up there and organizing it so everyone ended up in one boat? I was making better people out of them. Until we hit that rock, I gave them the greatest experience of their lives. I gave them their deepest selves. They found a bond that only comes to men who have bullets whistling over their heads. They can live with their wives for 50 years and never get that close. Well, I guess that's the spin you put-- Yeah, that's right, that's the spin I put on it, right. Well, I think it's wrong. Maybe it's OK to color things and flavor them if you're selling corn flakes, but with people's lives, I think they're entitled to decide for themselves how much risk they'll be exposed to. I don't think it makes you a good leader to keep people in the dark and drive them past their limits, I think it makes you a bully. Well, see, I made you a better man, too. Oh, wait, hold it a second. What, what? You want me to say I was a bad boy, that I made a mistake? What? If you have anything to say that I ought to hear, then tell me. I'm not gonna plead my case to you. Go in there and tell them what you saw. We hit a rock, Jack! We hit a rock. Let's talk about them for a minute. They were, what, what, children? 6-year-olds who wouldn't cross the street without my permission? No, listen to me, listen to me, goddamn it! I know how rough that sounds, but this is the fucking truth. They weren't just grown men, they were executive officers of some of the biggest companies in this country, and they blindly did what I told them to do and I killed them? That's a load of crap, Jack. They had every opportunity to get out of that boat, you know they did. I'm sick that those men are dead. I'll live with that for the rest of my life. But what about their part in this? What about their personal responsibility? What about yours? That's a good question. What about my responsibility? As I understand the objection, Miss Chung, Mr. Leslie Wayne Bechdel was not entitled to the right of expression of an opinion relative to his belief, re the professional conduct of Burrows-McCain as a professional... ♪ Aah! Aah! Mr. Robbins... Mr. Robbins? Would you please take the witness stand? I couldn't hear everything they were saying. I didn't want to get too close, it seemed to be eavesdropping. What I saw and what I heard was this Miller had another group that he was planning to put with us. And Dan said he had worked hard to put together people for this trip that could enjoy one another and relax. And he said, "Ed, what's going on? "What's going on? "It's difficult enough when you have a group, "some of whom were coming together for the first time, without having strangers." ... who we don't know in our boat with us. Is that clear? Do you understand what I'm saying? Miller understood what he wanted. When we got to the first minor set of rapids, yes, sir, I was aware that the boat was acting differently. Because when it would go into a trough it would take longer to come up. And it didn't seem to have the same snap action that you were accustomed to seeing in the raft? Yes, sir. Is that because after you'd had time to think about it you finally realized that it was because there was much more weight in this raft? I didn't have to realize it. Miller addressed the group that had gone rafting the day before, and he said, "If you'll notice, the raft is somewhat slower because there's more weight in it." Thank you, Mr. Robbins. Have you arrived at your verdict? We have, your honor. Please hand it to the bailiff. "We, the jury, find for the plaintiffs "and against the defendant. And further find the following..." The total amount awarded to the Karas family was $2 million. No, no, listen, listen, listen. We don't pay the whole thing. Some of the negligence in the accident, 45% of it was attributed to the men themselves, so, the award was brought down to a million-one. Right, that's right-- 45% them, 55% us. Turns out the other guys were 45% responsible. I guess the truth isn't all that simple, is it? Oh, so that makes it all right. You, you still don't get it, do you? What exactly is there to get? I mean, besides the fact that you caused a lot of wreckage in there. I don't consider a few dollars for Nick Karas' widow wreckage. I think our company can afford it. Our company? You think either one of us is gonna stay very long at that company after that testimony you gave in there? I guess I thought a few other things were more important. Like what? Why did you do this? You could have got up and said what you had to say. You had to go that extra inch, didn't you? You gave her that St. Bernard sincerity and you just... just tipped it against us. Why did you do that? I don't know. I had this thought that maybe I should help someone who wasn't me. Wild...isn't it? I'll see you, pal.
