Will Mr. Paul Heller please call reception How dare you go through my things It's just part of the job but you were the last person to see him alive and had dinner with him on the night he was murdered Why do you say "murdered"? Sorry. Well, we had dinner that night. Uh, whenever we work late, we always have dinner. Uh, Gretchen knew about it. - Gretchen? - WOMAN: His wife. How convenient. All right. You might as well know. We went to dinner at the Flamingo Bar and Grill. And by about 10 o'clock, we were playing kneesies under the table, and having dessert. Like the good old days. And then we went to the motel. And then it happened. What happened? We balled, and we balled, and we balled. Till he dropped dead. Touché. NEIL: Let's go to lunch. [Motorcycle revving] [Music playing] [Heavy breathing] [Bees buzzing] [Dramatic music playing] [Birds chirping] [projector noise] There, seems to be working all right. Now, tell me again what it is you're looking for. I don't know, it's just something Peters said. "They're dropping like flies". It's just a long shot. Let's go. VOICEOVER: Insects outnumber in species all the rest of the animal kingdom. Insects represent the highest grade of evolution among invertebrate animals, not only in terms of their complexity of structure, but also in their psychic development. [Fire crackling] [Sighs] [Chuckles] You mind if I smoke? I'm allergic to cigarette smoke. Oh, well, it's just a bad-- Sure you wouldn't like some dessert? No, I don't think so. See, I've got to watch my, uh-- SUSAN: Just a taste? Well, uh-- Hmm, just a-- Mmm. Mmm. - It's good. - Another taste? HERB: Mmm. VOICEOVER: The visual organs of insects consist of compound eyes. The entire image an insect sees, consequently, is a mosaic made up of as many units as there are facets to the cornea. Multiple vision occurs throughout the entire insect world. [Ominous music playing] [Sighs] VOICEOVER: The complete metamorphosis of the insect to its adult state occurs within the pupa. Finally, the worker bees tear open the milky white pupa, allowing the queen to emerge. Here, the queen has been marked with a red spot. The survival of a hive depends upon a fertile queen. Many queens are developed until one can be made fertile. During her lifetime, the queen will lay up to 20 million eggs. [Romantic music playing] [sighing] [Meaning] [Shushing] [Zipper unzipping] [Herb sighs] VOICEOVER: Examples of the female killing the male during mating are numerous in the insect world. Here, the black widow awaits the arrival of her mate, and if the male, upon sexual contact, is not extremely nimble, his fate is sealed. The female praying mantis not only kills the male upon mating, but even proceeds to devour him. Similarly, the queen bee mates in mid-flight.
