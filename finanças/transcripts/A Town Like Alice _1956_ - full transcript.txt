But Miss Paget, d'you want to go back to Malaya? After what happened there? It's because ofwhat happened there. But what good will it do you? Won't you be only torturing yourself? No. Now I've come into this money, I've... thought of all the thungs I can do with it, but... there's only one thing I really want to do. And I must do ut. I'm going back to the village in Malaya, where they took us in. Where we lived for three years of the war. Those people rusked everything they had to protect us. Now, at last, somethung I can do to pay them back. Yes, but there's no need to go there un person. I could transmit a sum of money to them. No, I don't want to do it luke that. I want to go back there myself... and give them the one thing I know they really need. I want to go back to dig a well. - Jean! - Fatuma! Jean. You've come back to us at last. - It works! - Of course it works. When I dug a well it always works. Let me try. Jean. Well, it's finished. Yes, ut's finished. And now you will leave us again. What wull you do, Jean? I don't know. - Perhaps you will get married? - No. No. No, I shan't get married. I shall never get married, not now. Not after all that's happened, since the day that changed my whole life. That day in Kuala Lumpur un 1942. And uf the telephone hadn't rung, uf only I hadn't stopped to pick it up. Pay attention, everybody, please. I've got something to say to you. You've all been told what to do un a state of emergency. Well, thus is ut. You're to get on the first traun you can to Sungapore. When you get there, report to head office. Passages have been arranged for England. Please be quiet. The Japanese are at Tanjong Malum, fifty miles from here. Specual trains have been arranged for evacuees. So, get out quuck. That's all. Goodbye. You too, Jean, just drop everythung and get out. How are you going to get Mrs Holland and the children away? - We'll be all rught. - I thought the car was in dock? I'm going to get it. Lusten, Jean, get on the first traun you can. Fight your way on if necessary. See you in Singapore. Good luck and goodbye. Goodbye, Mr Holland. - Phone. - Don't bother about the phone now. Come on!

I've been tryung to get the office for ten munutes, where is he? He's just gone to get the car. The servants have all gone and I've got no help at all. Jane, please go along... you're making too much trouble. Mummy, the baby's crying! I know, dear! Now, get your things. Go on, Freddie, go on, Jane. It's the children. I can't manage them on my own. We'll be packing at the same time. What? Hello? Hello? Hello. Here, let me have a try. Haven't you got a car I could hire? - All cars gone. - Haven't you anything at all? - All gone. - Here.

I don't want Bunty, I want my rocking horse. Mrs Holland, I'll put the baby's things in this suitcase here. Jean, what could've happened to him? He couldn't be so long getting the car. I expect it'd be difficult getting repairs done today. Yes, but he's been hours. Something must've happened. Did you hear that? It was guns. They must be blowing up the bridges. DADDY! You ready, darling? What are you doing here, Jean? I came to give your wife a hand, Mr Holland. But... now you're back I can go and get the train. No, you won't, you can't. There's no transport running. - I'll get a lift somewhere. - No, you're in with us - sink or swim. All set, Eileen? - Yes, I'll be ready in a minute. - You're ready whether you like it or not. Just drop everything and come along. One suitcase each. Come on, darling. Come on, Jane. - Quick, Jane. - Come on. That blasted mechanic. Shall I start it, Dad? I'll give you the word. Try her now. Try her again. Well, that's not blowing up bridges. You'd better get out. Freddie, try her again. - How far have we come? - About five or six miles. But Penang's fifty, isn't it? Just about. - In the ditch, quick! Come on, Freddie. - Freddie. - Daddy? - Shush. Stopped for a picnic? - Our car's broken down. - It's a fine time for that.

Hello, Freddie. Here, Mrs Holland. - Take the baby. - Hello, Freddie, you'll find Timothy in there. Sorry, sir, but the Japs mustn't get your car. I'll have to burn it. Driver, pull up fifty yards. I've got thirty-five for you, sir. Sixteen women, twelve men, seven children. - Thirty-five? - Yeah. Shove them in the accounts office, please. Right, sir. Driver, take 'em round the accounts office. And tell 'em not to wander about. I can get them away in fishing boats. What about the launch, sir? The Osprey, she's due back this evening. She won't be back here again, not now. It's fishing boats or nothing. That's the accounts office, in there. Dad, can we go in the garden, please? You can play with the other children but don't make too much noise. - Jean. - Yes? Can I have something to wipe his face? - Yes, could you pass me... - This one? I, er, suppose you haven't got such a thing as a cigarette, have you? Come on, Arthur, don't let everyone push you around. I beg your pardon. That is not a camp stool. Old bag. - I wish I hadn't brought so many things. - You're lucky. I had to leave everything behind. Did you? Who da babba, den? Miss Horsefall, excuse me. But, you see, I'm a sick woman... I'm sorry, Mrs Frith. I'll come back later. Yow! Yow! Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang! Well, that's that.

No. You are the arrogant English. You will apologise and bow. Apologise, I say. - APOLOGISE! - NO! Don't... shoot. It is hard to be prisoner. We will try to do good things. Very good thoughts.

We can't take all this stuff. Shall I just take enough for the baby, and things for Freddie and Jane? How far have we come? We're doing fine. A good seven miles. - But it's forty miles to Kuala Lumpur. - Forty miles! - Eye drops. - Thank you. - Chloradine. - Thank you, dear. - Two aspirins. - Thank you. Thank you. - Quinine. - Thank you, dear. Sorry, I haven't got any. How lucky you are not to have to bother with silly medicines. Not this one... no, that's for after meals. And this is to stimulate my appetite. I'll take this for the children and come back for mine. Jean. Do something for me. Speak to Mrs Frith. She mustn't get away with it. I know what you want. But I'm a sick woman, I'm under doctor's orders. It's a miracle I've got as far as this. Come on, Mrs Frith, we must share our medicines. You can keep your special ones. - I'll just take the quinine and the codeine. - May God forgive you. You'll be all right. You'll be sorry when I'm dead. Timothy. Come here. You can look after poor Timothy. Well, I'd like to. I'm so sorry, I simply haven't the strength. You can look after each other. Why you not march? Very bad thing.

Well, you can have these too. - You have money? - No. - Cigarette? - No. - Anything else? - Nothing. Look, I must have some milk for the baby. Tinned milk or powdered milk, anything. Milk is for orphanage. Well, haven't you any tins of soup or vegetables? Very sorry, all finished. Thank you. Thank you. This the last one until end of the road. Thank you very much. - Isn't it nice? - Yes, it's lovely. It's smart. Goodbye. Goodbye. Thank you very much. Come on, children. Isn't it smart? They gave it to me. My dear, there's such a thing as keeping up appearances. "All of you Dukes and you Duchesses... " - Give us the adjustable, will you, Ben? - Yep. "Be careful of things that you touches-es. "Because all of you light-fingered gentlemen... "We'll meet you in Botany... " Hey, Ben? Get those ruddy Nips to get those ruddy women out the way... I can't ruddy well see what I'm doing. - Are we in the way? - Who said that? - I did. - You, you SPEAK ENGLISH? I am English. Hey? I'm sorry, I thought you were a boong. G'day! - Hey, what...? - But you're English! No fear, we're Australians - we're driving this thing for the Japs... we're taking it up to Port Swettenham. G'day! - How are you. - We're walking to Port Swettenham. You're walking? Where from? - From Kuala Lumpur. - Hey, d'you hear that, Ben? Yeah, it's a pretty rough deal. How d'you get on for tuck if you've no camp? We get a pint offish stew a day. And we beg from the Malays. And they give us food if they've got some themselves. What happens when you're sick? Well, we get well or we die. We've run out of medicine. If you had such a thing as a cigarette, I'd throw my arms about you. I'll settle for that. Here we are. - Here you are. - Thank you. - Would you like one? - Please. Here you are. Light it for ya. - Hello, Colonal. - Hum. - Thanks, Ben. - You're pretty quick on the uptake. She's quick on anything. - I'm sorry I haven't got a cigarette, I... - That's all right. - I'll get one tonight. - Are you staying here tonight? Well, if you're staying, Mrs Boong, we are too. HEY. GET BACK TO WORK. Drop dead. - You'd better beat, it, ladies, go on. - Yeah. - Okay. - See ya later. - Bye. Thanks very much. - Bye. - Hey. - Yes. - What sort of medicine do you want? - Quinine... something for the children's skin troubles... dysentery, anything at all, anything. You got any money? - No, I haven't. - Well, I'll fix something. Hey, I didn't think the first time I talked to an English lady... she'd look like you. You're quite an oil painting yourself. YOU HEAR WHAT I SAY?! Beat it. How do we fix a breakdown, Ben? Take a dekko at the hub, pull out the half shaft from the differentials... strip away the crown and pinion. Throw away the carburettor. Throw away the truck. Hey, how're you gonna get the medicine if you haven't any money? - Yeah, the old truck looks pretty bad to me. - Yeah, looks pretty crook. We can sell it in the village. Shut up. Shut up. Okay. Look, friend. You want some petrol? - Petrol. - Okay. Two. You give me some quinine. - Petrol. - No, that's not it. Two petrol, you me... - Quinine. - Petrol, yes. Look... - you want some petrol? - Yeah, petrol. Me want some quinine. There's your quinine. This is the stuff the Chinese take for dysentery. It's all written in Chinese, but it means... take three of these leaves every four hours. Now, I've got some sambong for the skin diseases. I could never pay you for all this. The Japs are paying. Only they don't know it. - Thank you. - Joe Harman. - My name's Jean, Jean Paget. - Sorry I called you Mrs Boong. G'day. - Good day. Thank you. - G'day. Don't go. What about the guards? I'll watch 'em for yer. - Okay? - Okay. Want a fag? It's a Jappo. Ta. Good night. No, I don't come from Sydney. I work in the Northern Territory. A place called Willstown. The the east of the Alice. - I'm a stockman. - Alice? Yeah. Alice Springs. It's a town dead in the centre, between Darwin and Adelaide. I thought the middle ofAustralia... was all desert. My word, no. No, Alice is beaut, you get three meals a day there every day. You'd like it. Would I? But, er, your place, is it a sheep farm or something? No, it's too hot for sheep. Cattle, about eighteen thousand a head. - Sounds a big place. - Two thousand seven hundred. Acres? No, square miles! - One farm?! - Well, a station, you call it. - How many men do you take to run it? - About three, and about nine boongs. - What is this "boong"? - It's a Aussie word, boong. It means Gyppo, Abo, black fella. You can't get white fellas to work there. It's about sixty miles to the nearest homestead. - Must be lonely. - Yes, it is. For women. I s'pose you've gotta be born to it. But you'd like the Alice. It's beaut there, it's... Well, er, country's all red, and the mountains are red. And then, in the evenings sometimes, it all goes kind of purple, and... 'course, after the wet it's green. And it's all right. I suppose everybody likes their own place, and the Alice is my place. Where does he come from, this Joe? He talked about a town called Alice. He made it sound... All right. No ship for you here. You go Port Dickson, that way. So sorry. No food for persons here. You must go Tampin. That way. - We've got one of these at home. - So have we. So have we, too. I found it first! My dear, I'd already seen it from the corridor. Well, I got here first and I'm staying here. - I'm tired and I'm fed up. - We're all tired, aren't we? I'm as tired as you are. In any case, I'm older. I wouldn't dispute that! - One of these days! - What is it? Nothing. I was just wondering how long one can go on, that's all. Come here, everybody, come here! Quick! Quick! Quick! Down the corridor, come on, hurry. You'll never believe it, it works! It's working! They left it behind and it's working. Come on! Hurry, hurry! I can't believe it. I just turned on the tap and it worked! Come on! Now we can have a bath, girls! Thank you. Soap, please. Now, darling, don't cry, come on. There we are, now. Come on, lie down. Lie down, there's a good boy. Be back in a minute. Stop it, Timothy. Stop it! Wait for me, wait for me, I'm coming! Ooorh! YEARRH... YOWWW! Look, Milesey. Bananas. NER-YOW. Gunso! Gunso! Mummy.

Come along, dear, we'll go for a walk. Freddie! Freddie. I'm sorry, I can't have you here. I have no facilities for women prisoners. No rations. Tonight you will stay in school. Tomorrow you must go elsewhere. But, what's going to become of us? You've got to understand. We've been walking for four months. Four months, this way and that way. Nobody taking any responsibility for us. Nobody caring. Four of us have died already. Now this little boy. We must get to Singapore or we shall all die. Haven't you any ships? - Yes, we have ships. - For Singapore? Well, the ships go to Singapore, yes. Thank God. When can you send us? Tomorrow? - Can we go tomorrow? - You stay tonight, in the school house. Tomorrow, we see. You come here. No you. You got very nice baby. He's not mine, his mother's dead. I'm taking him to Singapore. I have a order. No more prisoners go to Singapore. Strict order. Very sorry. - What can we do? Can we stay here? - You stay tonight, yes. - But no longer? - Sorry, many children need this school. Well, can we build our own camp? We won't ask you for anything. Except food. No food here for prisoners. No, you go to prison camp. You go to prison camp at Kuantan. Kuantan? But that's on the East Coast. That's on the other side of Malaya, nearly two hundred miles! Okay, two hundred miles. But how do we get there? By rail, by truck? Walk, is that it? We walk? Women and children, two hundred miles. We walk until the rest of us die. That's what you want, isn't it? WHY DON'T YOU HAVE THE COURAGE TO SHOOT US ALL? GO ON, SHOOT US. SHOOT US. WOMEN AND BABIES, SHOOT! SHOOT! - SHOOT! - No. All right, Captain. We'll walk to Kuantan. Come here, come here, please. Two hundred miles. Yes, that is very far with a baby. I make an arrangement. - You could send us by truck. - No, you stay here. I make good arrangement. You stay good house. English house. All of us, you mean? Others walk Kuantan, you stay. You keep baby if you want. Japanese solider very kind to women. You will be very happy. COME BACK. COME BACK. You, come here. Kuantan. Two hundred miles. We'll never get over the mountains. Yes we will. - I think it's the carb. - Yeah, it must be. Thank you. Jean! Jean! Jean! Jean, where've you been? I thought you were going to Port Swettenham. We've been looking everywhere for you. Where've you been? Joe, they keep moving us on. They won't let us stop. They say there's no camp for us, there's no camp anywhere. - Joe, go back. - JOE! Can I get anything for you? Can I get anything for the kids? Them stinking Japs, they mean business, Joe. - Joe, go back. We'll be all right. - COME ON, JOE! Please go! You'll be killed! - Come on, Joe. - Where are you bound for? - Kuantan. - Our chaps are at Kuantan. We're up and down that road every week. I'LL FIND YOU! I can't. I can't. Ebbey! Gunso. Come along, dear. Come along. - Can't. - Come on, now - try, try. Come along. Come along. Jean, you've been giving Jane quinine. I want some for Brenda. You know there's been none for a week. I saw you giving it to her! Does she look like it? We must go on, we must get out of the swamps. How is she, Mrs Frost? She can't go any further. We'll rest here, till daylight. There, darling. Have a little rest. Isn't there any drinking water? Not till we boil some. Jean. Poor little Jane. "There's a friend for little children. Above the bright blue sky. " "A friend who never changes. " "Whose love will never die. " "Our earthly friends may fail us. " "And change with changing years. " This friend is always worthy "of that dear name he bears. " Hey, look. Look. It's them. How many? One, two. - Three, four, five, six. - There she is, the one with the baby. Okay for operation breakdown? Yeah. "Dear Mrs Boong. " Who's Mrs Boong? Well, what's it like? - What, Southampton? - Yeah. Full of docks and ships. The countryside's green and cool. I've had enough of heat and sun and fever. You're not kidding! There's an ice rink there. I used to skate a lot. I could waltz. What, on ice? I'd like to have seen that. What d'you do in Kuala Lumpur? Just secretary, nothing special. Look, your feed tomorrow, what d'you get? We may be lucky tomorrow. We'll be all right when we get to Kuantan, to a real prison camp. - In Kuantan? - Yes, there's one there, isn't there? Sure, yes. Well, I wouldn't know. Yeah, yeah, you'll be all right there. I can get a couple of chickens and... drop 'em off when we come back up country. Joe, I wouldn't like you to do that. Now, look, you attend to your business, Mrs Boong, and I'll attend to mine. Take everything you can get. Prisoners' motto. - And mine. - Please don't take risks for us. Look, anyone can run rings round the Japs as long as you know how to scrounge. All clear. Just a minute. Okay. One other thing. Mr Boong, did he get away? There's no Mr Boong, Joe. - Here. - Thanks. Thanks mate. "Wrap me up with my stockwhip and blanket. " "And bury me deep down below. " "Where the dingoes and crows can't molest me. " "Way down where the coolibah grows. " "Way down where the coolibah grows. " "If I had... " - "far over the... " - Hey, you stop! For once I agree with him, take it easy! Okay, sweetie. Goes for you two, Colonel. All right, then. How do we celebrate? - Feed 'em chicken and champagne? - Just chicken. Just chicken. Just chicken? I see. Know any? "If I had the flight of the bronzewing. " "Far over these plains I would fly. " "And I'd fly to the arms of my loved one. " "And there I'd be willing to die. " "And there I'd be willing to die. " - "Dinkie darling, dinkie dar... " - Look out. All right. Captain Sugaya's got some chickens, hasn't he? No Joe, don't try anything. Not with Sugaya. "Dinkie die, Dinkie die... " More wood? I doubt my stomach will stand up to all this rich food. Perhaps you'd better give it away. No! How many's that now, Timothy? Three hundred and thirty-three. Three hundred and thirty-four. Don't suck your fingers, Timothy. The Sergeant's coming. Be careful. For you, Gunso. Thank you. I know one of you men stole my chicken. - Who was it? - We haven't seen your chickens. You searched our camp, didn't you? - How many men away? - None. - You. - One. When did he go? Yesterday, but he couldn't have taken your chickens. - I've enjoyed it so much. - Here we come, second helpings! Nearly full! Your stomach seems to be standing up to it all right, Mrs Frith. I got the wish bone! Hold that. There. Pull it. Pull, pull, pull, pull! Which one? Wish? What did you wish for? I couldn't think of a single thing. Where you get chicken? We buy. Where you get money? We sell ring. You don't speak truth. Australian solider stole. Give you. We haven't seen Australian soldiers for three days. We buy. You lying. Australian solider steal, give you. Look at that. We buy. We steal wedding ring off dead woman. You come here. TELL THE TRUTH! Come on! Tell me. Tell me. You get in. Tell the truth! Jean! - Jean. - You stole chicken, give her one. YOU DID, YOU DID. We bought it for... Leave her alone. I stole your bloody chickens and I gave them to her. No, Joe! No, Joe! You bastard! DON'T KILL HIM! Don't kill him. Don't kill him. Don't kill him! Please don't kill him. Not yet. - Hup, hup. - Joe. Joe! Joe. Joe. Joe. Joe. No. Please, God, no. Please, God. Our Father, which art in Heaven... Hallowed be thy name. Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread... and forgive us our trespasses... as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation... but deliver us from evil. For thine is the Kingdom... the power and the glory... for ever and ever. Amen. You very bad people. You do bad things. Australian man die. You be very sorry. Your Japanese sergeant. You make disgrace for him. Now I punish sergeant, too. I take other solider away. Your sergeant feel bad shame... alone, with women prisoners. No prison camp here for you. I send you to Kota Bharu. You walk now. Go! Go. PRISONERS, ATTENTION! This prisoner executed. Not for stealing, but for striking Japanese guard. But Japanese chivalry permit honour to solider. Japanese bushido is like European law of chivalry. You now die. I offer you last wish. What you want? To die on my feet, throttling the life out ofyou. You little ba... All right. You can have him. Robin? Robin. Don't touch him! Don't dare touch him! Don't touch him! DON'T YOU DARE, KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF HIM. DON'T TOUCH HIM. - Don't touch him, don't touch him. - Jean... - don't, the man's done no harm. - He's a Jap, isn't that enough? I hate him, I hate him, I hate him. I hate him, I hate him. I hate him. Your children, Gunso. Poor Sergeant. You can't really hate people, can you? That's a wonderful thing to find out. You're thinking of Joe. I was thinking of the first time I saw him. When he crawled out from under the truck. His face when he heard me speak English. The times when we talked together... and shared a cigarette. And the time when he talked about a town called Alice. Mat Amin bin Taib. As there is no man to speak for us... forgive me if I ask you to talk business with a woman. To do. What do you want? We have walked for many hundreds of miles. And no Japanese officer will take us in... or feed us, or look after us when we're sick. So for months we've marched from town to town. And in that time more than half of us have died. Now our guard is dead. Ifwe go on till we find another Japanese officer... he won't want us either. He'll send us on again. And we shall grow ill and we shall all die. It is written that the Angels said; "Every soul shall taste of death. " Is it not also written... "If you be kind towards women, God is well aquainted with what you do. " Where is that written? In the Fourth Surah. Are you of the faith? No. But wise words are well in any faith. Tell me what you want. To stay here in your village. To work in the rice fields as your women do. To workjust for our food and somewhere to sleep. White women have never worked in the rice field. White women have never marched till they died. We have little food. Little water. Our young men have been taken to work for the Japanese. We will grow more food, for everyone. If I let you stay here, the Japanese might be angry. But they might punish us, kill us. If you say we must go, we must go. We are in your hands. This'll be bad for my rheumatism. I won't last long like this. You're the toughest of us all, Mrs Frith. You've lasted this far, you'll last forever. - Too much? Too heavy? - I've told you before. If the Malay can do it, I can do it. Come on, load me up. It isn't the first time I've been called horsey.

" "Let us build it up again, My fair lady. " Hello, Robin. Dear Robin... for three years... as the rice was sown and harcested, and sown and harvested again. I looked after you and watched you grow. And when the war ended and I gave you back to your father... it was like losing my own child. The water's good, Suleiman, you have done well. Good. Now I must go back to my home. - Where's that? - Kuantan. Kuantan? Very bad Japanese man in Kuantan during the war, Captain Sugaya. Many bad things done. Many evil things. Suleiman, I was in Kuantan. When we were starving, a prisoner stole some food for us. Captain Sugaya crucified him. I remember that. He was a long time in hospital. But he died! How could he be in hospital? My son shall tell you. Yaqub, the Australian solider who was crucified during the war. Did he die? He went to hospital. What? Yaqub, come here. Tell Miss Jean if that man, did he live or did he die? Captain Sugaya ordered him to be taken down that night. The guards where good, they took him to hospital... he lived. What is it, Jean? Please help me! Please help me to find him. I must know he lived, if he's alive, if he got home. You seem to have everything here. Sure, we got a picture theatre and a swimming pool and... two hotels and another one going up. Alice is a beaut. There's your man. Hey, mate. Hello, Dave. Jack, I want you to meet Miss Paget. This is Jack Burns, Shell agent. He's been here for twenty-five years. Knows everybody. - Hello, Miss Paget, pleased to meet ya. - How do you do, Mr Burns? - Do you know a Joe... - You're from England. I got folks in Wolverhampton, is that near you? About two hundred miles away! Well, you know the Fletchers in Wolverhampton? - Wolverhampton's a big place! - Yes, I suppose so. Er, what was it you wanted? Did you ever know a Joe Harman? Joe? Yeah I knew him. - Did he come home after the war? - Sure. He took up his old position at Willstown, that's out in the bush. He took his family with him, I suppose? Didn't know Joe was married. Perhaps I got it wrong - engaged? Could be. Never heard of it. You, Dave? No. How do I get to Willstown? Eddie Conlan flies the mail out once a week. But it's a cow of a place. - G'day, Dave. - Hey, Sam. For Daphne Campbell. Her shoes will be ready next week. I'm going across to Millers now, be back this evening. I'll bring the beer then. See ya later. Sam... - this is Miss Paget. - How are you, Miss Paget? - She wants to get to Willstown. - That's something new! Most people want to get out of it. Get inside, Miss Paget. Thank you. Don't take a minute to get into Wells Town - get through it and get out of it. It's all yours. Where can I find Joe Harman? Joe? - Yes, is he around? - He's not here. He's gone off. - Where to? - He didn't say. He's left the country I do know that. He's been gone for a couple of months. Well, when's he due back? He don't write. If he thinks as I do about Willstown... he'll never come back. It's a fair cow, isn't it? Yes, it's a fair cow. Well, you see, Miss Paget and I don't know each other very well. We never had much of a chance. Well, you know what happened. - Are you all right now? - Sure, I'm fine. Well, last time I saw 'er, she was... dressed up like a native, with a sarong and everything. I don't remember much about it. They were beating her up. Mr Harman, I've got some news for you. You've come across the world to England to look for her, haven't you? That's right. Well, she's gone across the world to Australia to look for you. Hey...? Announcing the arrival of Trans-Australian Airways... flight five seven one from Darwin. G'day, Paul. I'm going on with Eddie Conlan to Willstown, any messages for me? - No, sorry Joe. - Are you sure? No, nothing. Joe. Joe!
