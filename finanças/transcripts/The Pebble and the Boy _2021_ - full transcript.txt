That's a long way. Well, we could do a road trip, just me and you. He loved going to Brighton. It's what he would have wanted. I don't think so, love. He wouldn't want us going all the way down there. [garage door whirring] [pensive music] Well, mate, the advert did say it'd been in an accident.

Yeah it is, but, you're not gonna get all the way down there on it, are you? Why not? My dad did. Whoa, what you doing? You're staying here tonight. Come on. Your mam's gonna pick you up in the morning. Come on. Gonna sulk all night then, or what? I just feel like I've let him down. Listen, mate, you haven't. Honestly. I'll tell you what, that bike will. How'd you know him? Your dad? I met him on my way to my first ever Jam gig. It was Bingley Hall, 1981. We ended up sitting next to each other on the coach. Your dad shared a bottle of Strongbow with me. [chuckles] - Was he a mod then? - Oh yeah, yeah. And a smart one at that. I remember we all had Harrington jackets on, and parkas over the top button down shirts and ties. And your dad just had a polo shirt on, and halfway through the night, we're all sweating our bollocks off, and some of us are passing out with the heat and I just turns and I looked at your dad, and he's just stood there with his polo shirt on, looking cool as fuck, honestly. Had some top times wi' your oul' fella. Chances of him finding out are pretty slim anyway. Yeah, better to be safe than sorry, eh. Okay. Yeah, see in you the morning. Okay. Bye. [exasperated yell] Marion is a complete bitch! I have tried talking to her, like you said, and she wasn't having any of it. She just kept banging on about my attitude. I swear to god, I came this close to knocking her out, let me tell ya. John this delightful creature's my daughter, Nicola. It's Nicki. Yeah, she's been having a bit of trouble at work, mate. Well, not anymore. She's sacked me. Oh, brilliant. So's that your scooter outside? It's, er, yeah. John's my mate Phil's son, Nic. The who got killed by the bus? Sorry. Listen, John, I'll go and make the spare room up, yeah? Be nice, eh. [beer pops] You staying over? - Well it looks like it. - Why? Scooter broke down, Geoff helped me fix it. What's that? It's my dad's ashes. Fuck off. Well I was gonna take him to Brighton, to scatter them. Stupid idea, I know. Oh. Come on. We're going upstairs. [vinyl crackles] What Marion needs to realize [ethereal music playing] is that I'm the reason most people come into that shop. She doesn't have a clue about fashion. - Do you work, John? - No, I'm at college. Doing? Sports science. - To do what? - I don't know. I honestly haven't thought that far ahead. By the way, my dad hates me smoking weed in the house, so if he comes in I'm blaming you, okay? So come on, tell me more about Brighton. Do you go there on the bank holiday weekenders? No, I've never been. Call yourself a mod? I'm not a mod. Yeah. You're funny. Do I look cool to or what? Yeah.

Me and John are going watching Paul Weller in Brighton. Found the tickets in the parka pocket, Obviously, we're gonna be, you know, all mournful and that when we scatter the ashes, but Weller, Dad! You know how much I've wanted to see him. Yeah well you're not going, neither is he. What? Why, it's not like I've gotta be up for work, is it? No, just get yourself some breakfast. I'm too excited to eat. - You're not going. - Dad! John shouldn't be doing this on his own, it's not fair. Tough. It's not happening. Dad, please! Oh, you're such a tosser sometimes. Sorry, John. Nice to meet you. Do you want a cup of tea? [Nicki] "Do you want a cup of tea?" Dickhead! [door slams] So listen I've got some spare mirrors in the garage, if you want me to swap 'em for them broken ones? [doorbell rings] Right, that'll be your mam.

[all laughing] Well actually I was reading about mods and rocker fights in Brighton, so, you know, I just thought that- What? That we were gonna kick your head in 'cause you're a mod? [they laugh] Oh ha ha. I'm not actually a mod. Oh fuck off! Listen all I ever get from him is once a mod, always a mod. - He never shuts up about it. - Bless him! [all laughing] [John groans] Right. Oh right, where you off? Home. Bit too drunk to ride anywhere, aren't you, my friend? Well I don't care, friend. [laughing] Ooh! - Aw, look. - See ya! [toilet flushing] Sorry. Maybe it's time we got you into bed. Come on. Oh really? Easy, tiger. I've got him. Hey, there's plenty of me to go around. Hm. I feel sick. Jesus, I don't even remember going to bed. Do you remember groping Dionne? Fuck off. Mm-hm. Jesus Christ. Well, erm, anyway, I meant what I said about, er, going home, going home today. Okay. I respect your decision. Right, erm, thanks. Right, I'm gonna get some toast. Have you seen Nicki? Yeah. She went that way, my friend. - Shit. - You've put too much oil on it. What you waiting on, John? Go and get her. [engine revving] Hey. Nice one, lads. No worries, man. [John] Sorry for groping your wife! Yeah, no worr... What? What did he say? "Sorry for groping your wife!" [laughs] No he didn't. You what? Did he? [engine purrs] You are bang out of order. Really? - Give him back. - Nope. Nicki, I'm not messing around giving back to me now. No. Just because you're such a wimp why should your dad have to suffer? Suffer? He's fucking dead. Go and grab yourself a coffee. Excuse me, what do you think you're doing? Oh, I'm just having a go. Pack it in, you're gonna flood the tank. I wouldn't mind flooding your tank, love. Oh yeah, in your dreams, dickhead. Get off. I said get off! Ey. Look out, it's fucking Liam Gallagher. Get off the scooter. Or what, little man? Knock him out, John. Yeah, John. Knock me out. Come on, I know you want to. Ey! Oi! [glass smashing] - [Lads] Whoa, whoa whoa! - What the fuck? Get back in your shit car, and go. Last chance, bumpkins! Get in the car, get in the car. Get in the car. [engine starting] Yeah, thought so. Fuck off. Suck my dick! [engines puttering] Why are we stopping? Don't let those idiots back there ruin your day. Oh, as if! Okay, I'm not. I just don't think this is a good idea anymore. Oh, not this again, for God sake. Okay, well how much money have you got? About 40 quid? Why? Because it's not enough. We're gonna need food, we're gonna need petrol, we're gonna need a place to stay. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I thought. I'm turning back. I bet your dad never turned back. [gentle poignant music] Look. Is it just the money that's stopping you? Yes. Right. Well, I can sort that out. How? [engine starting] We're near Woking. You know who lives in Woking, don't ya? [horn toots] Hello, Ronnie! I fuckin' knew you'd turn up here! - [both laughing] - Hello treacle! You all right? Aw, we are the fuckin' mods! All right, son? Here, Sonia! Sonia, come out and have a look at this! Oh Nicki! Look at you, you look fantastic! - Thanks. - Long time no see. And erm, this must be John. He's the image of his father, isn't he? So come on then, what's gone wrong? What d'you mean? Well, your old man rang me and told me you was on the way to Brighton, so you're either in trouble or you've run out of money, which one is it? So come on then, where is he? Here he is. Listen, I'm sorry I didn't make his funeral. I've just been up to me eyeballs in business stuff. I've had the tax man shouting 'cause he wants his dough and all that, y'know? All right, Logan? I don't think he remembers me. I don't even think he remembers his own name - half the fucking time. - [Nicki laughing] [Sonia] Right, you get these two a drink and I'll put the food on. Sweet, right, what you havin'? Sonia's asked us if we wanna stay for dinner. I said we'd love to. Thank you. Thank you, darling. [door slams] Oi, what you think you're doing? Oi! We got company. Congratulations. First class prick. What? Not you. Him. I remember you now, it's er, it's Nicola, isn't it? It's Nicki these days. And what do we owe the pleasure? We're just passing on our way to Brighton. What you going there for? To scatter and my dad's ashes in the sea. Weird. Oi. You show some respect. Warms my heart to see the new breed. He says he's not a mod, Ronnie. Oh yeah? You could've fooled me. What, so you're one of these casual mods? What they call them, modules? Oh, stop teasing the boy. It's all right, I'm only playing. These Mancs are switched on, in't ya? Not like this sap. - You what? - [music in headphones] I said can you pass me the salt, my love? [Sonia] Logan! So. How much d'you want? Well now you mention it, John was wondering if he could lend us a hundred quid. Nicki! It's all right, take no notice of this one. I've known her since she was a baby. You sure a hundred quid be enough? Oh go on then, two hundred, you twisted his arm. Hey, guess what? We're going watching Paul Weller when we're in Brighton. Apparently so. Well, I won't lie and say I'm not jealous. You seen him before, John? No, I'm not even into him. Get the fuck out of my house. [laughing] Oh, you must've listened to your old man's records. There's gotta be something in there you like. Erm, yeah, there's one that goes like - [Sonia] Look what I've found! Oh leave it out, Sonia, they don't wanna be bored with all that! - Oh shut up, Ronnie! - I do! So there they are, the three amigos. That's Phil, Geoff in the middle, and look, it's Ronnie. Scowling as usual. [laughs] [Nicki] Oh, look at my Dad. He looks dead handsome. Yeah, well they all were, but that was a very, very long time ago. [both laughing] Is that my dad, dancing? Oh yeah, he was a an ace mover, your old man. When he took to the floor, people used to stop and watch. In't that right, Son? Yeah, they certainly did. [John] Wait, what's that? That was when we drove up and down outside the Tory conference beeping our horns. Oh yeah, we were a proper fucking nuisance that day, it was quality. Is that my dad at the front? Yeah. He organized it. He organized it? Mm-hm. It was an amazing day, wasn't it darling? Yeah. Well, that's enough of the ancient history lesson, I think. Oh Ronnie! I'm gonna go and get myself a drink. There you go, all right? Good. You'll stay in here tonight. I don't get it. Front page of the newspaper and yet he never mentions it to me. Why? Dunno. Maybe he became a Tory voter. Come on, get up. Come with me, I got a treat for ya. Come on! [energetic dance music] I don't remember this! I had it done for numb nuts, when he said he wanted to be a fucking DJ. Oi, turn that fucking boom-boom shit off and put on the one I told ya! Go on, put it on! That's it, go on! [lively guitar music] [Ronnie and Nicki cheer] Let's get this fucking party started!

Enough, enough. You know what, it's late, we're just... we're gonna go to bed 'cause we've gotta be up early in the morning. Yeah, let's go to bed. No, no, no, no one's going anywhere.

Don't, because you could really upset her. Just put it down. Where you going? All the girls fancied him, you know. He was so handsome. [gentle music playing] I was just looking for him. Come and sit down. Come on. There we are. Now I, I want to apologize about earlier. Ronnie, he gets a bit jealous. Of your father! He always was. Who was he talking about? He mentioned something about Ali and my dad. I wouldn't pay any attention to him. He takes too many pills and then he says things to get attention. You are so like Phil. I better... Better what? What John? Get to bed. Gotta be up early in the morning. Night night. Goodnight. [garage door clattering] Here you are, get out the way, let me have a go. Oh, dear. - What's wrong with it? - It's fucked. I mean, that's the trouble with these old classics. You know what, I'm surprised you got this far, to be honest. Yeah, you're just gonna have to knock this trip on the head. Try it again. [engine firing up] How'd you do that? Someone turned the fueler. Not just a pretty face, is she? You guys getting off? Yeah. Thanks for letting us stay. Aw, it's been lovely seeing you, you're welcome, my darling. So, er, any chance we could trouble you for that loan, Ronnie? Yeah, yeah. Too right, I'll just go and get my dough. You will be careful on these roads, won't you? - Yeah. We'll drive really slow. - Okay. I'll go and see where Ronnie is. He's probably forgotten the combination to his wallet. Can we go, these people are fucking mental! He's giving us money! Right. I'm gonna give you three hundred, which is an hundred each, all right? I think your maths is a bit off there, Ronnie. No. Because Logan is gonna come with you. Since when? Since about two minutes ago. Yeah. And don't go spending it all on drugs, all right? And if there's any scratches on this motor, I'm gonna fucking knock you sparko, d'you understand me? Ronnie, Ronnie you'll have it dark, they want to go. Logan, my little soldier, I love you. You be careful. Bye, Nikki. And John, good luck. I'll be thinking of you. [engines roaring] See you later, Ronnie. See ya, Sonia! Oi, oi! You remember what I said to you. Yes, now fuck off, you freak. Fucking wanker! You really are a fucking idiot, d'you know that? [engines running] I'm gonna tell him to turn back. - Give him a chance! - I don't want him here! What is he doing? Who knows? Keep an eye on him 'cause he's got the money. [Logan] Guys? Can we stop? [John] No! [Logan vomiting] Are you okay? [Logan groans] Yeah. Although I do feel like I'm about to shit my pants. - [both laughing] - Ew! You're fucking mental! No, stop, 'cause I will actually poo myself! [laughs] Is this all a big joke to you? Me? Both of you! He started it! - No, she started it! - Shut up! You shut up! Oh fuck me, get a room. - Don't be a dick, John. - I'm not being a dick. I just don't really think that this is a laughing matter. - Right, come on. - Nah, I'm not going. John. We're almost there. I don't care. I'm not gonna beg you. I didn't ask you to. Fine. - Ride safe. - Yeah, you too. [engine revving] [poignant music] [engine speeding off] [phone rings] What d'you want, Mum? I just want to know that you're okay. Yeah, I'm fine. - And also to tell you... - What? Look, hurry up, Mum, my phone's about to die. I just want you to know how proud I am of you, doing what you're doing. Riding all the way to Brighton for your dad. It takes some guts. - I really miss him. - I know. But you do know that he's with you, don't you? D'you think? One million per cent. He'll be watching you riding along on that bloody old scooter, and he'll be laughing to himself and he'll be going "Go on, my son!" Mum, can I ask you a question? D'you know someone called Ali?

You can help me pick something. - Hiya. - Hiya. [upbeat music playing] Shout me if you need a hand. - Cheers. - Thanks. John. It's your dad. Which one? That one. - Phil? - Yeah. You knew him? Yeah. He'd always pop in the shop when he was in town. Hey, I'm sorry to hear about his passing. - Thanks. - Oh, hold on a minute. There you go. What is it? Phil ordered it on the phone, said he was gonna pick it up next time he was down, but obviously... Right, thank you. Cheers. So are you gonna open it then, or what? - It's a cool picture, innit? - Yeah. Where you going? Nicki! [shop bell tinkles] We want that picture. Oh I'm sorry, you can't have it. How much do you want for it? It's not for sale. But it's his dad and he's dead. I'm not moving till I get it. Nicki! Just... leave it. Why don't you just go to the Argus and get a copy? They sell 'em at Argos? No, the Argus is a local newspaper. [John chuckles] Right, well we'll just do that then. I'll write down the address for you. [shop bell tinkles] [whimsical music] - Argos? - Fuck off. Hey. I, erm... Let me just... Listen, John. I am not the kind of girl that gets shagged in an alley. Not in daylight anyway. Wow. Er... Well, I wasn't asking, so. And I wouldn't anyway, cause I know you're with Logan. What? Me and Logan? Well you spent the night together. He was in your hotel room. He's in the room next door. He literally came in a minute before you did. Hey, whatever. I swear to God. You're such a dick! Well, er, anyway, I was, I was trying to say thanks. You've not got it yet. Not just for that, for... Babysitting you. I wouldn't be here without you, so... thanks. Let's go get this picture. Hi, how can I help you? [phone buzzes] Go on. I'm looking for a picture from one of your newspapers of my dad, if that's possible. I can try my best. Do you have a date the picture was in? Some time in 1984. His name's Phil Parker, and it's on the front cover, if that helps at all. Cool. Take a seat and we'll see what we can do. Cheers. Really? [laughs] No, he's sat next to me now. Who's that? It's just my boyfriend, Logan. No we haven't ditched you, sweetie. We're on a mission to get a photo of John's dad. What are you up to? I can't really hear you, I'm gonna call you back. Okay. Bye. Problem? No, we found a cover, but it's from 1987. Must be a different Phil Parker. Let's have a look. [somber music] John. Sorry. John! John, please just listen to me. John! - Shut up! - Who are you ringing? [Voicemail] Hi, this is Dawn... John, just listen to me! No wonder he wanted to keep me away from here. But you don't have to go, we can just talk about it! Just don't speak to me. - This is all your fault. - Me?! You made me come here! John please! [engine sputters] Fuck off! [engine roars] John please just, John! John!

Logan, have you seen John? No, no, why what's up? Something bad's happened to him. What do you mean? He found out his dad attacked someone and he's really upset, I can't find him. I thought his dad was dead? Will you help me look for him? Yeah, yeah. Give me a minute, give me a minute, all right? [waves splashing] [seagulls squawking] Do you need a hand? [gentle pop music] Finished with these? Hey Danny, check this fella out. Yes, Joe, once a mod, always a mod. Mods are wankers. All mods are wankers? I'm not a mod. What are you wearing that for then, a bet? Yeah, something like that. Got my nose broken over there, way back in the sixties. Geezer comes up behind me, hits me over the canister with a deck chair. He was a rocker. Seems silly now, punching holes out of each other. Just 'cause one of us was wearing a parka and the other one was wearing leathers, but it was exciting. We were young. I was a mod. Name's Danny, by the way. John. Listen, whatever's happened, I bet a few drinks and a dance will make all the difference. Or a dip in the sea. Tide's coming in. Fuck! What's up now? No, it's not you, it's, I've left my scooter on the beach. I'm gonna have to go, I'm sorry. Yeah, it's heavy, innit? These things are heavy. Thanks for that. I appreciate it. No, it's no problem, no worries. Listen, I'm really sorry about before. I just, I was really worried about my mate and he's got a lotta shit going on at the minute, so. No that's okay, it's fine. Shall we go for a walk on the beach? No I can't, cause I've gotta find him. - Come on, just... - No. What are you doing? Don't make me kick you in the balls. Get off! Fuck off! Fuck off! I'm sorry, man. - Are you all right? - Yeah. I'm sorry. - It was a misunderstanding. - John! [tense threatening music] Now where were we? John! John, stop! John, that's enough. [sirens wailing] [melancholy music] I'm just like him. If you hadn't been there, I don't think I would have been able to stop. You would. I know you. I thought I knew him. It's a mess. Hey. John. Morning. Morning. Today's the day. No. I can't do it in the place he crippled someone. So what do you want to do then? Er, go home and talk to Mum. Whoa. What about the gig? I think it might help take your mind off things. Things like how I've been lied to my entire life? Like how my mum, your dad, Ronnie, they all knew except me. Maybe they were trying to protect you, John. Protect me from what? What made him do it? Who knows? Alistair Radley knows. Ali? The bloke he battered? Are you serious? I have to know. Who you phoning now? No one. There can't be that many Alistair Radleys knocking about, can there? There's one here in Brighton. Are there any pictures? I can't access him. It tells you where you works though. Brighton Fishing Museum. This might not be him, John. Well, I guess there's only one way to find out. [engines puttering] Hello? Hello? I'm looking for an Alistair Radley. Oh, you've found him. Give us a minute, I'll be down. John. You remember what Ronnie said about this guy fucking your dad. What if he meant fucked him as in get your mum pregnant? Hello, John. Hello. Well, I guess the fact you're here means that you know. Who told you, your mum? Is that it? - Is that all you've got to say? - I don't understand. You don't understand? Try being me. John. I know you're angry, but it's your dad, - you've gotta talk to him. - Excuse me? I worked out. I'm not his dad. You're not? - No. - No? I think there's some confusion here, maybe we need to start this over again, eh? Why don't you come in and have a cup of tea. You two look like you could do with one. [Nicki exhales] Well that was a bit mental. [seagulls cawing] Me and a bunch of biker mates of mine, we were out in Eastbourne on the lash, getting pissed up and someone came up with the bright idea of coming back to Brighton. Once we got back here, Bank Holiday Monday, place is wall to wall with mods. And we were making a bit of a nuisance of ourselves, but we saw this bunch of mods on the steps, leading down to the beach. And, um, I dunno, it was a bit of banter, nothing really, and then someone threw a bottle, and it just all kicked off big time. And, erm, I got pushed down the steps, did this, and everybody just scattered, they all just ran. Except for your dad. He stayed with me till the ambulance came and then the police arrived. They arrested him. I need to know why he did it. Well, I can understand that. And the short answer is he didn't. - But he went to prison. - He did. Your dad spent four years in prison for an attack that left me in a wheelchair. But it wasn't him that did it. If he didn't do it, then... Your dad refused to tell the police who he was with. So copped for the lot. Judge made an example of him. I always admired your dad's loyalty to his mates. So much so, I wrote to him when he was in prison. The last thing I was expected was a reply, but hey, [chuckles] well that was Phil for you. And do you know, he's the only reason I'm not still in a wheelchair today. I don't understand. When your dad got out the nick, he came and visited me, we made friends. He dragged me out of that wheelchair. He was very persistent, I used to dread him coming down. He was a very special man, your father. Why didn't he tell me? The tickets. We found two tickets in Phil's parka for the Weller gig here Brighton. That's right. One was for Phil, the other one was for you, John. Listen, John, thanks for seeking me out. I really appreciate it. You ride safe, you two. [Nicki] Thanks, Ali. See you later. [engine buzzing] Ali, can I ask you sommat? Fire away. Who do you think it was who pushed you down those steps? [suspenseful music] - [Logan] My dad? - Yeah. And then he legged it and left mine to take the blame. That's why he was acting weird the other night. Guilt. What are you talking about? Come on, you know this. That's why you're here, isn't it? To spy on us. See? Fucking knew it! Whoa, whoa, whoa, listen, all right? All he said is if I heard anything about a fight they got into, I was to ring him. Oh right, and did you? No, no! I didn't, all right? I swear. I don't do anything that idiot says. - The man's a first class... - First class prick. And a coward by the sounds of it. God, I fucking hate him. Yeah well, my dad was there and all. He could've said summat. All right, so what actually happened? Dad got sent down for four years. Shit, man. I'm sorry. Listen, it was a long time ago. It was before we were born. Yeah, but still. Right. I'll get the drinks in. - Ronnie's paying. - Yeah, I'll come with you. Right then, Scooby-doo, now that you've solved your mystery, please, please, can we get pissed? I'll catch up with you. Keep an eye on that for me. All right, why, where you going? Not gonna run away. Again. I just need to clear my head. Fine. I'll have your drink then. That's like three times the face value. That's two tickets, mate, if you don't want 'em, one of these lot will. We haven't got enough. I don't believe this! What's going on? She's just upset 'cause we lost our tickets. No, you lost the fucking tickets! Look, I've said I'm sorry. What else do you want me to do? Hey lad, last chance before I let 'em go. - You'll have to, mate. - Fuck! Here you go, mate. Take these. Are you serious? Yeah. Are you sure, bruv? Yeah. Mate, I dunno what to say, you're a legend! Thank you so much! [Logan] Hey, there he is! You all right, mate? Y'aright? D'you want a beer? Yeah.

D'you think my mum and dad ever lay on this beach like this? - Why don't you ask her? - Oh I will. Yeah, now that the secret's out, she might actually tell me. Yeah. Maybe we can all start being a bit more honest with you, John. What's that supposed to mean? There's something else you should know. What, about me dad? What is it? Nicki, tell me. I'm your sister. [laughs] You're a dick. I'm so sorry! Proper dick. I'm so sorry, that was really bad! I shit myself. Oh my god! Could you imagine?! [gentle uplifting music] I'll meet you downstairs, yeah? [horn toots] You look like a deck chair, bruv. Yeah whatever. You two getting off? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. What, riding all the way back to Manchester? It's all part of the adventure, innit? Though, er, we will need some food and petrol so... [clicks tongue] Right. Don't spend it all at once. Good luck, mate. Yeah, I think I'm gonna need it. Ha ha ha.
