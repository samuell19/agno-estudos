SATURDAY I'll die at 35, because I don't want to be around for the third world war. I'll die during the winter, when it's much colder. I'll walk naked up north on a quiet road, until my feet are so frozen that I'll fall, gently, like a stone, struck by the cold and hunger. Why'd you stop? Keep going? You're giving me chills. It feels nice. I dream of snow? powdery snow, naked? naked in the snow. How's your sunburn? Not good. You shouldn't be out. One must know how to suffer. It's the way of the universe. I LISTEN TO RTL It's a 16-year-old girl who died. She drowned. She was a student. Serves her right. Goddamn it! Shit vacation, shit car! Bitch! Do you want me to help push? Sorry. Excuse me. Hello, sir. Do you have any rooms available? For sleeping or for sex? Pardon? Yeah. A room? I have one left. One overlooking the sea. Clothilde, take him to room 992. I'll kindly ask you to fill out this form? for the police. Will you be staying some time? Only a night. I'm headed to Spain. Spain? Go on, Clothilde. Hurry up. - Hello, sir. - Hello. Kid, be a doll. Go fetch my suitcase. A black suitcase, in my car, the black Cadillac out front. Does the room have a bathroom? Yes, sir. But baths aren't allowed at night. Pardon me. It's fine, kid. Thanks. You may go. DEAR MOM AND DAD, I WRITE FROM THE BEACH, WHERE I'M HAVING FUN. BATHS ARE STRICTLY FORBIDDEN AFTER 6:00 P.M. Sir, you called? Yes, the phone is out of order. No one's at the switchboard. There is someone at the switchboard, but there's no telephone. What's this for, then? If you have a complaint, you'll have to reach Claims. It's for decoration. It's not real. It's for looks. The post office is nearby? So to get breakfast, I'll have to go to the post office. No, there's a payphone downstairs that takes tokens. Want me to take you there? I'm not doing anything. I'm free. No, thanks. As for breakfast, that's my job. Just ring and I'm there. Perfect. Good. What time do we eat? At 7:15 in the evening, noon otherwise. Meals are served at set times. Very well. All right. Do you not want me anymore, sir? You mean, need you anymore? Sir? I'm glad this one's in the guide. It's worth the detour. Good evening, sir. Good evening. I'm here for dinner. There's no more room. No more room? That's too bad. I'm hungry. That simply won't do. I've been driving all day. May I get you an appetizer, sir? You're telling me this huge room is full? Hold on, sir. There may be a solution. Wait here. You're all set, sir. I managed to squeeze you in with a lovely lady. Follow me. Do you want salami? I don't know. What else is there? Salami. Takes a while. There it is. We're out of salami, so I brought herring. How in God's name does that fish smell so bad? I love eating cake with that smell? I want to leave. I don't like him. I'm sorry for eating fish while you're having dessert, but? It's because? You're obviously on vacation. Obviously. Geez. Off to a great start. Thank God I leave tomorrow. What an unpleasant woman. I've never seen such an ugly face. With a little style, she'd clean up. Like my herring, palatable after a few bites. She looks like a nun. A plainclothes nun. Nuns wear civilian clothes now. She's definitely Austrian. I never introduced myself. Marcassus, Gabriel Marcassus. Marcassus? Muriel Bouchon. Bouchon. Definitely Austrian. Would you mind sharing your table with this gentleman? I never introduced myself. Reverend Henri Jacques Monod, professor of Practical Theology. Thank you, sir. That's perfect. Clothilde, take Mr. Marcassus's bags to his car. Put it there. Watch it! Ma'am? I mean, miss, would you like me to make up your room? Is it not working? This place is lovely. It's pretty quiet. Back from a swim? I'm going in, too. It's my first time. Is it nice? These rocks are a bit of a pain. That was nice. A little cold. That really was my first swim. So? You can't be too careful on your first swim. Your body needs to acclimate. My mom always said? that when she was younger? CHILD Do you know of any local excursions? Go see Tourist Information. This year, I was planning to go to Spain? but my car needs a vacation. We both do. Bitch. You're still here, Mr. Marcassus? Well, yeah, it's my car. She's done for. What kind of car do you have? A Cadillac. It's still a good car, but it's old now. Have you seen a mechanic? It's Sunday. He was at the beach with his family. Yeah, you're right. It's Sunday. Shit. Maybe it's just the distributor? Or maybe the spark plugs? This is my wife. Mr. Marcassus. Ma'am. I hope you had a lovely day. Did you swim, at least? I prayed. You'll have to excuse me? I need to make sure I can stay another night. I must go back and pray. See you later. Right. See you later. Pardon. Yeah, it's me again. Did the maid tell you I'm keeping my room? I know all about it, sir. I'll ask you, upon intending to leave the hotel, to make sure you're actually able to do so. Also, I recommend you have your Cadillac serviced. To that end, I called my half-brother, a mechanic, to tow it to his shop. Your key? sir. Dear Mom and Dad? Henceforth, this is your personal table. Thanks. Your wife isn't here? She's not sick, I hope? No, she's fasting. ?dith is wonderful. She hasn't eaten for nearly three months. MONDAY Come in. It's unlocked. Good morning, sir. Good morning. How's the weather? Same as yesterday, sir. Be a doll, bring the tray to the bed. To the bed or on the bed? What? I'm kidding, of course. There you go, sir. Thank you. I'd love to sleep in. What's your name, kid? My name is Vicka. Vicka Montero. Are you Spanish? No, why? - Portuguese? - No. You're not Swedish? No again, sir. My mother is Romanian, my father is Mexican? and I'm Dutch because of Dutch law. But I've always lived in France. Do you want a croissant? Sure, I'd love one. There's nothing like a fresh croissant. We only get yesterday's croissants. It's just not fair. No, allow me. How many sugar cubes? Two and a half. There. I should go now, because? it would be inappropriate if I stayed longer. I like you, you know. What a mess. It's the transmission. It'll take at least eight days. Eight days without complications, because there usually are with transmissions. Hello. Hello. Looks like I'll be staying here. What do you expect with these damn cars? It's always the same thing. You're right. I used to have a Citron. It's a great car. Never had any work done. With the increase in purchasing power, the democratization of morals, everyone wanted a car. No better way to get around. People have too much money. They have everything, and they're still unhappy. Don't talk politics, honey. Hello. Hello. It's nice, you know. This is my second swim. I'll join you if you want. No. It hasn't been three hours since I've eaten. I'm waiting? for my digestion. So you're waiting three hours? Yes, for my digestion. I wait two hours. I wait three. Some people aren't careful. They swim after eating. It's no fun. It's so dangerous. The other day, a 16-year-old girl drowned. Pebbles are beautiful. Too bad they hurt your feet so much. Why don't you change at the hotel, to avoid all this trouble? I put mine on at the hotel. I put on my bathing suit at the hotel. I don't like wearing a bathing suit under my clothes. A bathing suit is meant to be worn bare. That's true. It's a matter of sensitivity? of one's skin. Yes. Plus, they're itchy. Look at this rock. Have you seen this pattern? And this shape? It shines, it radiates. I think it's radioactive. No two are alike. Have you been here a while? Twenty-three days. The ocean? - Isn't it a breath of fresh air? - Yes. Iodine. Yes? Iodine. What do you think about the other guests? I'm not seeing anyone. Have you met the reverend? Isn't he quite a character? Would you lend me a franc? L'll pay you back. Thank you, sir. Enjoy your vacation. The reverend's wife is also quite a character. Have you seen her hands and feet? Looks like stigmata. Exactly. Jesus Christ. What a trip, staying at the same hotel. She has an air of exhibitionism? How about an aperitif? This looks nice. No, another time. Why not? Come on? I'm really busy. I need to write. I have laundry to do. Doing laundry is prohibited in your room. I'll report you if you don't get an aperitif with me. No. No. No. Tell me? You wouldn't happen to be Austrian, would you? TUESDAY Come in. Good morning, sir. Good morning. How's the weather? Same as yesterday, sir. Bon app?tit. Thanks. Come in! Good morning, sir. Good morning. Feeling okay? Yes. It's my day off. Is that right, kid? Well, I'm free. No way. She's going to invite me? I'm going on an outing. I'm going on a drive. If you want to come? Seeing as I like you. There it is. She invited me. What do you drive? A Cooper. Mini. The reverend's right. These people are rich. Well, seeing as I'm free? Have you read The Miracle of Theophilus? No. It's a play by Rutebeuf. Is that right? Have you seen that woman? I see her. So what? I've seen her before. Well, they all look the same now. As I was saying? It's about a young man, Theophilus, who gets robbed by a bishop. I have flaws just like anyone else, but I love head cheese. She's beautiful, don't you think? She's a little fat. Tonight, my wife and I are going out. We're going to a sacred music concert at the House of Culture. Is that right? It's all lunatics now. Here comes your wife. Tonight, my husband and I are going out. We're going to a spiritual music concert. At the temple. She means sacred music, and at the House of Culture. It's at the House of Culture, not the temple. You said the temple. No, I never said that. It would be great if you'd join us. Miss Bouchon can come too if she wants. Miss! Miss Bouchon! Miss Bouchon! I wish I wasn't here right now. Miss? She can't hear me. Miss Bouchon! What? There's a nice musical concert? I mean, spiritual music? Sacred, more like. At the House of Culture, in town. Well? The liturgical music? Did you like it? Yes. It was well done. Yes. It was well done. What are they doing? Shall we leave them? Yes. WEDNESDAY Are we too loud? No, ma'am. You're not. - Hello. - Hello. - Are you going to the beach? - Yes. You? No, not this morning? I have to go to the mechanic. Do you want to go on a bus tour? Certainly not. Don't tell me you've done all the excursions? I came here to relax, not to be on the road or be a tourist. To relax, sleep, swim. I've never been seasick. I have no idea what that's like! Look! Porpoises! There, where I'm pointing. Over there. See them? There. Too bad. They were right there. The ocean? "If I were king of the waves, you would be my Tethys, queen of deep waters." "And for your home, the ocean, you would have?" Nice? THURSDAY Come in. Good morning, sir. Did you sleep well? It was magical. - There. - Thank you. Are you comfortable? Yes, I think so. I'm so hungry this morning. You have a strong appetite. Yeah. I also have a strong appetite. I need to go pee. May I use your bidet? Go ahead. Good morning, miss. Sir, ma'am. What's the matter? Well, Sacha? Sacha? Is everything okay? Everything is fine, old man. Leave us. That went well. Go on. Back to work. Vicka, you stay. We need to talk. I don't get it, boss. You know, Vicka, your attire? Your attire is quite suggestive? Well? Is today the day you get your car back? Transmissions are never simple. You know, Vicka? She was fired. Hey, there's your wife. I'm hungry. Why didn't you wait for me? You were talking to the reverend. One thing's for certain. The reverend and his wife? They make an odd couple. You know what happened, don't you? You don't? I don't know. The reverend's wife got sick. Do you find that funny? No, definitely not. She stuffed herself so full of yogurt, cakes, and jam, she got sick. It wasn't pretty, let me tell you. I helped him carry her to their room. I thought she'd died. When we got there? Listen, that's enough. I know the reverend's wife is quite a character. Still, she's not the only one. I'm also quite a character. You're also quite a character. There are other conversation topics. Sure. Tonight at six, I'm getting my car. Shall we swim to the pontoon? I'll never make it back. Are you happy? You're getting your car back. Well, yeah? Being without a car is never fun. Are you taking off again? I don't know. I wanted to go to Spain this year. I've never been there. Have you? I've been to San Sebastian. Last year, I went to Italy. Venice, Rome? Florence, Sicily? You can't miss Sicily. Have you been to Italy? I've been to San Remo. But this year, with this week's delay, with this damn car? Maybe I should stay somewhere and relax. - You have to recharge. - Sorry? I'm saying, you have to recharge. Sure. How long are you staying? Until the end of the month? No. I leave on Sunday. This Sunday? Yes. I'll have stayed four weeks. This year, we got a fifth week off. - I'm spending it with my family. - Sorry. In Corr?ze. That's where I'm from. It's a slew of nephews, nieces, uncles, aunts. Some of them are getting up there, so I better see them before? You should stay. I'll be bored if you leave. I'm hot. What day is it? It's Thursday. Are you sure? Yes. I've been keeping track, and there's two days left until Sunday. It's Thursday. Still? it's too bad you're leaving. I was getting used to you. Well, I'm not very outgoing. I'm not easy to reach. I'm like this pontoon. I don't trust easily. I'm antisocial. Antisocial? No way. - It's true. - No, you're not! You know nothing about me. I know nothing about you. That's the beauty of vacation flings. We part ways in three days. That's just the way it is. You'll see. At home, we return to our routines. You live in Paris? I do too. Vacation flings don't necessarily end with August. Last year, I met a French couple in Milan. Now we see each other regularly in Paris. This year, they're visiting Scotland. When you leave on Sunday, I'll give you my address in Puteaux, and my phone number. And if you can stand me, you could leave me your Paris address. I'll show you the photos I've taken. Unless? you can't stand me? You surely have friends in Paris? I'm antisocial. You don't believe me? Have you ever been married? Are you interrogating me? Is this an interrogation? I won't talk? Be quiet. You scare me when you talk like that. I don't like answering questions. Telling you what I do in Paris is pointless, how I live, where I'm from. Corr?ze? I've never been married. I'm an old maid. I like my freedom. I never cared about pairing up. Still, I can't say I haven't had plenty of opportunities. What am I saying?? Are you happy? Do I have to tell you that I think I'm ugly? Shall I talk about my sex life? Come on? Don't touch me. What's gotten into you? I mean, it's true. I'm sorry. No, I am. No, I am. No, I am. ?16, 77,90 francs. In the fifth Vincennes race, 10 and 19 win 383,10 francs. Placed 123,60 francs? I'm going to the bathroom. ?52,30 francs. In Deauville's third race? Timex Electric, the white-point watch, the watch that goes tick, tock? Timex Electric. So, does your car work? Like new. And your wife? She made it all day, but then? Now she has colic. Good evening. I'm Jean Bernard, and if you would like, and if you have enjoyed the program? Miss, you have a phone call. Me? Hello? It's you! Well, then! He died with his mouth open, his hands out front, crying, "I'm dying!" He stayed conscious until the end. Isn't that beautiful? - Nothing bad, I hope. - No. My family wants to know when I'm coming to kill the pig. Have you finished eating? Yes. I'm waiting for coffee. Come join me. I am too. Okay, sure. How are you, Muriel? May I call you Muriel? Well, sure? I insist. Have you seen my camellia? My camellia flower is rare. Your coffee, ma'am? - Miss, I mean. - Yes. And mine? Just a moment, sir. I'm the only server. What was that? Who taught you to serve like that? Bring this cup back on a tray. With a saucer. What was that? I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse her. She's young. Must be trained. You don't know how hard it is to find servers. - Mr. Sacha! - Yes? There's a call for you. Are you here? I'm right here, fool! Those flowers need water. Here you are. It's not a good idea for you to eat chocolate mousse right now. I'm deranged right now. So is everyone, a little. Now that your car is fixed, are you hitting the road? - Does the smoke bother you? - No. I think I'll stay until Monday. Say? what if we took a drive tomorrow? I don't know. Little pervert! Dyke! Pig! You make me sick! So are you or are you not interested? in taking a drive tomorrow? Well? I'm interested. FRIDAY SATURDAY Come in. It's unlocked. - Hello, sir. - Hello. It's a lovely day today. Probably a lot of drowning people. I am at your service, sir. I am yours for the asking. Don't be shy. I'm good for nothing, but I do everything. Don't say that. Two years ago, I was a maid. Then I quit. There are no jobs. And now? I'm a waitress. I like my job. One should like their work. It's a beautiful day. There will surely be many fatal car crashes. Goodbye, sir. Feeling well, miss? Very well, thank you. I'm well, too. Good morning. I was waiting for you over there! - You good? - Yes. I saw your stuff on the beach, so I thought, "l'll wait for him." Well, that's nice of you. You're not swimming? No. Why not? Well? because. Because what? Well, because? - Is it nice? - Yes! But? Here. If you're not swimming, how about some ice cream? - Sure, thank you. - Careful. It's melting. Do you like the flavor? What do you have there? Presents. Souvenirs for my family. Your family? First time you've been up here? Yes. My first and last. Why's that? I don't like visiting the same place twice. I often revisit places I've been? for the memories. - That's because you're sentimental. - Maybe so. Why don't you paint your toenails red? It's green. - Bon app?tit. - You too. The other day, I was talking about a book. The Miracle of Theophilus. Well, I brought you a copy. That's very kind of you. Now I have to read it. Mr. Marcassus? Yes? ?dith has a question for you, but she's too afraid to ask. Nonsense! Go ahead and ask. I'm getting sick of these two. She wants to go on a drive. Don't worry. That's easy. I'll take you tomorrow, because today? - What? - I'd rather go today. She says she'd rather go today. It's just that? SUNDAY - Forget anything? - I don't think so. I made you wake up early. I should have taken a taxi. No. Don't mention it. We're on time. The train only stops for two minutes. You have to quickly find your car and board your bags. Don't worry. It's windy. It's windy. Here. My address and phone number? in Puteaux. Here, a souvenir. A memory of me. Because you're sentimental. No. Pocket it. It's nothing. I wanted to thank you. For what, pray tell? Well, yeah? Yes. So you won't be going to Spain, I assume? No. I've lost interest. I'll drive along the coast to Cerb?re, and I'll slowly make my way back up. Surely earlier than I expected. To avoid the rush at the end of the month. Kisses. MURIEL BOUCHON 4 PLACE D'ITALIE PARIS XIII I DON'T HAVE A PHONE I REQUESTED ONE FOUR YEARS AGO Subtitle translation by: Liberty Johnke
