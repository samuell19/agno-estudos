That should cover this for the time being, captain. Till formal warrants are ready. That's good enough for me, all I want to do is to get started. ‐ Well, sir‐‐ ‐ No, don't go yet. There's a man I want you to meet. Ellis? ‐ Tell Major Burton to come in. ‐ Yes, sir. Burton's starting a big project out your way. Horses, he's got a contract with the army. It seems the Remount Service never caught up with their losses since the war. So much reconstruction everywhere. The farmers won't part with their horses. There's no one source for the army to draw upon. Major Burton, sir. ‐ Good morning, major. ‐ Good morning, governor. I wanted you to meet Captain Norris before you left. ‐ Major. ‐ How do you do, captain? He's going to be in charge of the Texas Rangers in your district. From what I've heard of the Rangers I imagine the excitement will stop as soon as they hear you're moving in. Well, hardly as soon as that, but I think we'll gradually make an impression on them. I can't deny that you're gambling your money in the wild country, but with any luck at all I think you should make a good thing out of it. I think the army owes you a vote of thanks. Far as the state of Texas is concerned we're mighty glad to have you. ‐ Good luck to you, sir. ‐ Bye, governor. Bye, captain. See you, governor. Order, order, order. Cowboy.. ...do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife? You're doggone right I do. 'Lady, do you take this here' 'cowpuncher to be your lawfully wedded husband?' Yes, sir. Then I pronounce you man and wife. ‐ Ten dollars. ‐ Oh. Honey? A dollar's all she's got, judge. Lady, you sure got courage. He ain't worth it.

Yes, sir, this is God's own country but the Devil's own people. 'I just want to tell you this.' I represent an Eastern God. They wanted to invest a lot of capital out here. Now, what do you think I'm gonna tell 'em? 'I'm gonna tell 'em that anybody that invests a dollar' in this country is crazy. There's a fella I met up near Smoky Creek. 'I don't know, major, Major Burton's his name.' He's got $50,000 in horses. Thousands of them. I told him he should have chucked his money into the creek would've saved him a long trip anyhow. Who's that tenderfoot up there? Oh, him? That's Wellman. He's out here lookin' around, judge. He wants to invest some money? Well, I guess maybe we can accommodate him. Looks like the judge is about to call court. If the court will please come to order. 'The deputies will bring the prisoner' 'before the bar of justice.' ‐ Hey, watch that‐‐ ‐ You're coming with us. Stranger, I am Judge Blake. Legally appointed judge of this section. This is my court. You're accused of allowing to tell there was no law in this section except a six‐shooter. Do you plead guilty or not guilty? I, uh, but, judge, I was only‐‐ Guilty or not guilty? Why, uh, guilty. Prisoner, accordin' to your own admission you're guilty. In the name of the law, I fine you.. ...five hundred dollars. ‐ But, judge, that money‐‐ ‐ Order in the court. Discharge the prisoner. This session of the court is hereby adjourned. Now, that'll teach that tenderfoot not to talk too much. When are you heading for the Burton Ranch? Everything's all set, we'll clean that spread out so they won't have a horse left to ride. And by the way, how many heads he got up there? ‐ About fifteen hundred. ‐ Fifteen hundred? Why he's got more than thousand. More than a thousand, eh? I'm glad you ain't making change over this bar for me. Alright, boys, you know what to do. And don't let anything stand in your way. I don't see what got into your father to come to this savage country. Sometimes I think we made a great mistake to come here at all. I know we'd all be scalped. That's absurd, Aunt Carrie. The Indians are perfectly friendly. Beside, you know, you'd love to be carried off by an Indian. Alice, how can you say such things? Anyway something terrible is going to happen. I feel it in my bones. Just think now in Connecticut the roses are blooming. It's so quiet and peaceful. But this is exciting, Aunt Carrie. I love it. Anybody can sit in the garden and pick flowers. Here we're doing something. Hmm, the aroma of that coffee whets my appetite. Yes, sir, major, I can sure do justice to a good meal. You know, Jordan, this is the first dinner in two weeks I'm really going to enjoy. Now that we have the horses ready for the drive it's a big load off my mind. And mine, too. ‐ Hello, daddy. ‐ Hello, sweetie. ‐ Hello, Bob. ‐ Hello, Ms. Alice. You're just in time, everything is all ready. You're going to be ready to leave in the morning daddy? Yes, the horses are in great shape for the trip. We ought to make Dodge City without losing a single head. That's fine. Dinner will be ready in just a minute. Jordan, we'll see big developments here in the next few years. Mark my words. Right now the Texas Cattle Company is being formed. They're ready to invest on a big scale as soon as things settle down a bit. Sure would be great to get some good people in here. But I can't blame much if they're a bit leery. 'All this shootin' and killin' goin' on here lately' 'they're bound to think the law ain't much to count.' See, I told you, shooting and killing. One's life isn't worth anything in this wild country. Aunt Carrie, stop acting like a child. That's what you always say. I admit things look bad but in any case we can't complain too much. Just the same, I'll be glad when we get this bunch delivered and get the check from the Davis brothers. I agree with you there, Jordan. Hey, some of you bums get up on that hill. Well, they're handlin' pretty good so far. Yeah, well you better turn 'em to the right, Jake. Oh, that's a good idea. Push 'em over. Major Burton, Major Burton rustlers are running off the stock. What? Come on, Jordan. I knew it, I knew it. I knew it. ‐ Aunty, I'm going after father. ‐ You shouldn't go out there. There they go, and we didn't have much trouble with the Burton cowhands, did we? No, they sure did hightail it. ‐ Hey, this was easy one, eh? ‐ Yeah. Look, I think we talked too quick, huh? Burton. Let's give it to him. Carlos, did he get you? No, but they get the horse. Hop on. Daddy! Daddy! Oh! ‐ How'd you make it? ‐ Clear sailing now. Luke, you take charge of the herd. I'll go ahead and meet you in Dodge City. Come on! ‐ See you later. ‐ Hey, what's this? I get no horse. We'll get you one out of the wild bunch. That's a good idea. Hey, wait, what do you think here? Alright, let him up. Well, that's the last one. Ain't a circle bar left in the whole valley. They're just plum extinct. It is very fine of the major to have nice easy brand like this one, huh? Was thoughtful of him. But I reckon an artist like Jake could've figured a way out. No matter how tough it was. Uh, Jake? ‐ Si. ‐ Come on, boys.

I got a nice rig and Luke will tell you I'm a good hand. Luke? That muttonhead's no reference. Besides, I don't like your get up, It's too pretty to suit me. Well, I could be of help. The money would sure come in handy. Now listen, tinhorn. Once and for all, I don't like you. Hmm. You're no little ray of sunshine to me. ‐ Hello, captain. ‐ Hello, Steve. Hey, I've been worrying about you. Give an account of yourself. Well, I'm afraid that's a pretty big order. I guess it would be if you told me everything. Come on inside. Looks like they've been keeping you kinda busy. You said it. Well, let's hear it. Captain, I think we got something on that Major Burton business. Yeah? Go ahead. Well, I hooked up with a big drive of horses on the way to Dodge City and I'm sure they were Burton's. How do you figure that? Well, Burton's brand was a circle bar. The brand on these horses were the circle X. Pretty easy to change a bar to an X and besides, the brands were fresh. Who owns the circle X brand? It was registered under the name of Judge Blake of Pecos City, almost two months ago. Judge Blake? It don't surprise me non at all, captain. Not by a long shot. ‐ Take a look at this. ‐ What is it? 'It's payment for the herd that I rode with.' 'The one that Burton died trying to save.' By a little sleight of hand, I got it from one of Blake's lieutenants, Hank Brady. That man Blake is the backbone of all the outlawry. He's in absolute control of all that country back of him. It'd take four times as many Rangers there are in the whole organization to go in and get him. Captain, I think I have a plan. Jeff and I can put this over. We'll give Blake the check and when he goes to cash it we'll arrest him and get him out of town before his men have a chance to get started. It's a mighty long chance, Steve. Suppose this Hank should come back? I figured he'd be afraid to come back after he lost the check. You'd be right, but I wouldn't count on it. Well, maybe not. 'Captain, with your permission we're leaving' 'for the Pecos right away.' If you think you can get away with it, boys, good luck to you. Anyway, if you get in trouble, you can always prove that you're Rangers. Well, captain, I'm afraid that'd be about the last thing we'd wanna do. A rattler up there is more popular than a Ranger. We don't aim to be the guest of honor at no neck tie party, captain. I guess you're right. Here's the hotel, Ms. Alice. I wonder where the court house is. There it is, miss. And I reckon you'll find Judge Blake in there now. ‐ Can I help you down? ‐ Thank you. ‐ You'll put the horses up, Don? ‐ Yes, ma'am. That was very nice, sir. Thank you. You're very kind. How do you do, ladies? Well, I'm Judge Blake. Uh, can I do anything for you? I was looking for the court house. They told me it was in here‐‐ I don't wonder you're surprised, miss. Uh, this don't look much like a courtroom, I'll admit. Now, we haven't any real proper courthouse here in Pecos City yet. Yes, I understand. I wonder if I could talk to you. ‐ Confidentially. ‐ Why, certainly. Uh, come right in to the hotel. Thank you. See you later. Now, uh, in what way can I be of service to you? I came to see you about the probate of my father's will. Major Burton. Perhaps you've heard of him. Why, yes, of course. You poor child. I knew your father well. And I'm mighty glad you came to see me. I'll consider it a privilege to do anything I can for you. That was very sad. A tragedy. Such a fine man. I wonder what the Burton girl wants with the judge. Don't look so good, does it? Uh, it looks like the spider and the fly. And I suppose that the fly needs a friend. You said it. I know, as soon as I saw that pretty girl I knew she was gonna need a friend. And I knew who the friend was gonna be. Uh, you're going to stay a day or two, I hope? ‐ Why, yes. ‐ Ah, good. Now, just leave everything to me. Uh, you'll be my guests. ‐ Oh, uh‐uh, Henderson. ‐ Yes, sir. Now, these ladies are my guests. Uh, see that they're made most comfortable. Yes, sir. How do you do? You're Ms. Burton, aren't you? ‐ Why, yes. ‐ I'm Steve Ainslee. ‐ This is Mr. Carter. ‐ How do you do, ma'am? How do you do? I wonder if we could talk to you for a few minutes concerning your business with Judge Blake? We‐well certainly, but, I'm afraid I can't ask you in. Oh, that's alright, uh.. Do you mind stepping downstairs for a minute? Well, if you'll wait for me, I'll be right down. Thank you, Ms. Burton. Ms. Burton, I don't want to seem mysterious but what I have to tell you is, uh absolutely confidential. Uh, Ms. Burton, while your niece and Mr. Ainslee are discussing very big affairs would you care to see the sights of Pecos City? I'd be charmed, Mr. Cartwheel. Uh, Carter is the name, ma'am, Carter. Isn't that silly of me? I hope your aunt doesn't think I was rude. I'm sure she'd be glad to get away from me for a while. I'm afraid I don't quite understand that. What is it you wanted to see me about, Mr. Ainslee? Shall we sit down? Ms. Burton, will you keep in confidence what I have to tell you, at least for a little while? I can assure you it's for your own good. Why, yes, if it's alright. I promise you it is. I'm a Texas Ranger here investigating a matter well, connected with your father's death. I have strong reason to believe that Judge Blake is deeply involved. Judge Blake? Why, I can't believe it. I'm positive it's the truth. Listen.. Oh, this place makes me feel so romantic. Yeah, you know, Ms. Carrie, this is quite a eventful place. Got a lot of big things‐‐ Do you believe in love at first sight? Yeah, I reckon I do. But I don't see so well. Oh, silly. ‐ You know, Ms. Carrie.. ‐ Mm? ‐ See that store over there? ‐ Yes. Well, one day, there was 12 men slaughtered just like that. Oh! And just the other day, the Indians came stormin' down that road scalpin' men right and left. ‐ Indians? ‐ Yeah, women and children too. And I'll never forget the time‐‐ Mr. Cartwright, uh, Mr. Cartwright.. Don't you think we'd better get back to the hotel? It's a pleasure, ma'am. It's a pleasure. Yes. I want you to know I appreciate your help. Oh, Alice, oh, we‐we've had the‐the most wonderful time. I'm so glad, Aunt Carrie. ‐ What have you been doing? ‐ Oh. Oh, nothing. Nothing special. Well, we must go to our room, it's getting late. Thank you, Mr. Cartridge. Goodbye. Goodbye, all. Come, Alice. Goodbye, and thank you for everything. Goodbye. Two charming ladies. What do you mean two? Hey, judge, I got to talk to you alone. Come on. ‐ Well, what is it? ‐ Judge.. The check I got for the Burton horses was stolen from me. Stolen? Why, you poor dumb halfwit. Who stole it? Some woman, huh? No, no, judge, I couldn't help it. A bunch of men jumped me and knocked me out. I can prove it. Honest, judge, I didn't have a chance. But no harm will come from it. You can get another check if it isn't cashed. There's nobody around here would dare forge your name you know that. Well, maybe you're right. But I still think you're dumb. But never mind about it now, I got something more important on my mind. Major Burton's daughter's here. What does she know? She came to me for aid and legal advice. She knows nothin'. She's got the deed to the ranch with her and if she should happen to loose it.. ...well, that ranch could be declared open to homestead. 'I get the point.' That's somethin' well worth goin' after. Uh‐huh, and then what do we do? When I give Blake the check, I'll tell him I'm a representative of Davis Brothers. When he goes to cash it, we got him. Oh, from then on, my friend, we've got to move fast. What do I do? When they're chasin' us out of town you'll act as a rear guard. Oh, I see. I get shot first, huh? Put out that light. What's the matter? Stick 'em up. Get away from that door. ‐ Alice, what's happened? ‐ I don't know. It's alright, ladies, there's no need to be frightened. Someone broke into your room, I think I know who it was. Now, don't worry, you won't be bothered anymore tonight. Somebody followed me to Ms. Burton's room. I think it's the same fellow who stole the draft from me in Dodge City. ‐ Is he up there now? ‐ I left him there. What happened? We heard a lot of noise. Somebody broke into the room there, but I guess he got away. What's goin' on here? What's this all about? Someone broke into Ms. Burton's room, judge. I happen to see it and got over as quickly as I could but he got away. You heard that, Ms. Burton? Is it true? ‐ Yes, judge, that's right. ‐ Who are you? I'm a representative of Davis Brothers at Dodge City. Incidentally, I have a check for you for the last bunch of horses you sent up. ‐ Apparently, your man lost it. ‐ And you got it on you? Well, yes. I was gonna give it to you in the morning. Wh‐why that's my father's wallet. ‐ Davis Brothers, eh? ‐ Oh! My friend, you're under arrest. In the name of the law, I charge with the theft of Davis Brothers check horse stealin', and the murder of Major Burton. Boys, take him to jail. Come on, fellow, get going. Alright, folks, you better all go back to bed. Ms. Burton, I'm sorry you got dragged through all this mess. But I promise you, that man will get the punishment he deserves. And, judge, he told me he was a Texas Ranger. Oh, he did, eh? I'd like to leave this with you. It's my father's will and the deed to the ranch. I know you'll do what's to be done. Why, of course, Ms. Burton. I'll look after your interests like you was my own daughter. Thank you. I know I can trust you. But I'm not going to stay here any longer. ‐ I'm going home. ‐ Now? In the middle of the night? Don't you think you'd better wait till morning? Probably, but I'm so nervous about the whole thing. ‐ I want to get home. ‐ I think I understand. I'll find your man and get your team brought around. And the rest you can leave to me. When everything's ready, I'll send for you. ‐ Thank you. ‐ Goodnight ‐ Goodnight. ‐ Goodnight. A lot of trouble bringin' this no‐account horse thief and killer to trial. Yeah, I've been thinking the same thing myself, judge. And him posin' as a Texas ranger.. Just addin' insult to injury. Still I suppose we gotta let justice take its course. I ain't callin' a session of court. I just want to say a few words in the interest of law and order. I want you to know that I have apprehended the murderer of Major Burton. Now, this outrage is doubly pitiful 'because it makes an orphan out of a little girl, his daughter.' Left alone and helpless to fight the world. Now, I know your ideas about what is a proper endin' for rustlers and killers. But boys, I want to warn you, in case any of you feel inclined to take the law into your own hands well, I'd be mighty upset. You wouldn't want us to take you seriously would you, judge? I guess there ain't much danger of that. Look. Better take a look in there, Slim see if our prisoner is alright. Yeah, he's alright. Stick 'em up. Come on up. Now turn around and face the other way. Come on, now drop those belts with one hand. Come on. Now, whichever one of you has got the keys to that jail step over there and open that door. Come on, I ain't foolin'! Alright, you birds, inside. Get your six iron. If you boys want to take a nice long sleep that's liable to last for a few thousand years just let one yip out of you. Listen, when they locked you up, I kept undercover on purpose. But I kept my ears and eyes open. Ms. Burton has turned all of her papers over to Judge Blake. ‐ She's goin' back to the ranch. ‐ Tonight? Yeah, she said she didn't seem safe around here. She's actin' a little upset. She'll be more upset before Judge Blake gets through with her unless we do somethin'. Yes, and you're going to be plenty upset too unless you do something. Their plannin' a nice little necktie party for you, Mr. Ainslee. They want to stretch them vocal cords of yours. ‐ Necktie party, eh? ‐ That's the plan. Well, then here's our plan. I'll show myself and they'll try to catch me. I'll lead them out of town and you go to the hotel and find out where Judge Blake keeps his valuables. Grab Ms. Burton's papers and clear out for the ranch and I'll meet you there later. Why don't you just shoot yourself now instead of doin' all this runnin' around first? Oh, it'll work. It's gotta work. Anything you say, Steve. What's the matter? What happened in here? They locked us up in there and then got away. ‐ Are you numbskulls? ‐ Well, we couldn't‐‐ Fine couple of guys you are. Shut up! What do you think you are put here for? ‐ 'Who's there?' ‐ Quick, Judge Blake. That guy Ainslee escaped from jail. 'Wait a minute.' Alright. Inside. Come on. Turn around. Now, put your hands behind you. You ain't gonna hog‐tie me. Listen, Blake, I'll hate to have to shoot you because I hope to see you hang. Now, come on, put those hands behind you. You're gonna wish you never was born. Yeah, well, ain't nobody celebratin' your birthday. Going back to town. Wait here for me. Well, judge, I hope we meet again. With you on the end of a rope. ‐ What are you doing here? ‐ Waitin' for you. Where did that fellow go who just came out of here? ‐ He goes this way. ‐ Alright, let's get him. ‐ How do you do, Ms. Burton? ‐ What are you doing here? ‐ Listen, Ms. Burton‐‐ ‐ I won't talk to you. But you've gotta listen. I didn't have anything to do with your father's death. ‐ What I told you is the truth. ‐ How can you say that? I saw you with my father's wallet. I took it away from one of Judge Blake's men in Dodge City hoping to prove something I've been trying to for weeks. You've got to believe me. 'You see, we, the Rangers' 'have been trying to get something' 'on Judge Blake for months.' 'It was my job to hook up with those rustlers.' 'The brands on the stock have all been changed' 'but there was no doubt that they were your father's.' That's Jeff Carter, my partner, he'll prove it. Hiya, Jeff. Did you get him? I sure did. We took these from Judge Blake before it was too late. In another week, he'd have everything you own. Listen, you heard me accused of murder, rustling everything there is in the calendar. If that's true, I'd bother with all this? I'm sorry. Maybe I was wrong but.. Never mind. I know you were upset. ‐ Looked bad, I'll admit. ‐ It still looks bad to me. 'That gang that followed me out of town is liable' to be here almost any time now. See who it is. Excuse me, Ms. Alice. We thought maybe somethin' was wrong. First one ride and come dashin' up here and then another. Well, there's nothing wrong. These men are Rangers. They're friends of mine. Boys, we've been trying to find out who killed Major Burton. We know now that it was Judge Blake and his outfit. And that's not the only killing they've been responsible for. They know that we have the goods on them now and so there's liable to be some trouble around here any time. Well, if there's any trouble connected with Ms. Alice we're in it. Thank you, Don. Ms. Burton, you better stay inside. We'll take care of this. We're legal deputies of Judge Blake and we want you two. And you better come peaceful. ‐ Suppose we don't? ‐ Well, then.. Maybe we get the judge to have a legal writ and take you by force. Are you trying to scare us? You killed Major Burton and stole his stock. You're a liar and if you don't want no trouble get on your way. Alright, Ellis, go back and get the judge and some more of the boys. They wouldn't miss seeing this peer dancing the fandango at the end of a rope for anything. Tell him to get all the men he can. And waste no time. Si, senor. Get a writ. Why, he can't even write. ‐ Get goin', Carlos. ‐ Bueno. It will take them at least two hours to get back here, won't it? Yeah, two hours anyway. ‐ I'm terribly worried. ‐ Now, calm down, Ms. Alice. I know things look bad, but we'll figure out a plan. ‐ Have we we got any more men? ‐ Yeah. Joe and Ben down at the corral. You better get them in here. I'll go fetch them right away. This fellow Blake is plenty tricky and we have to be careful of any moves we make. We'll keep out of sight here and wait for the judge. Pete, Sam, get up on that hill and watch the house. Well, here they are. Pretty small garrison, it's gonna be tough to hold them off. I know they got us outnumbered five to one. There's only one chance. ‐ I'm gonna take it. ‐ What are you going to do? Now, don't worry, everything will be alright. Jeff, you know what to do. Do you think Steve got through alright? Oh, sure. He's going to live to a ripe old age. Fortune teller told me so. Well, I should be alright if I don't die of suspense. Oh, they tell me that ain't so painful. Folks, here comes Judge Blake now. Ms. Burton? Ms. Burton! I'll go. What is it, Judge Blake? I'm sorry to bother you like this. But you're harborin' two men who are wanted by the law. And as the representative of that law here in Pecos County I must ask for their surrender. But they're not criminals, judge. I'll decide that. Pardon me, Ms. Alice, please. Now just what is it you want? I want you and your partner. What you want and what you get are two different things. In the name of the law, I demand your surrender. We don't recognize your law, Blake. Ms. Burton, if I don't get these men I won't be responsible for the consequences. I'm sorry, judge. ‐ I can't help you. ‐ I'm sorry for you. You'll hear from me later. Don't pay him no mind, Ms. Alice. Captain, the Burton Ranch is being attacked by Judge Blake and his men. We need every man we can get. Every man that counts, this is our one great chance to wipe out this bunch once and for all. Jeff and a handful of men are trying to haul them off until we get there. Norton, round up every available man at once. Come on, Steve. They won't hurt you ladies, I reckon no matter what happens, but you might get hurt accidentally. Have you got a cellar? No, but I can shoot. If they attack us, I'm going to fight back. That's fine, miss. But please be careful. 'Cause I kinda reckon Steve is expectin' me to look out for you. Now, you and Ms. Carrie, go in the kitchen there and keep low, will you? We'll attack in force and smoke 'em out quick. Go ahead, boys. Alright, boys, when they get close enough let 'em have it. Come on, let's get out of here! Come on! Alright, what's the matter now? What are you running away for? Their barricade is too strong for us. There's more in there than we expected. Let's split out. Fight 'em in groups. Set fire to the place. What are you waitin' for? Go ahead. I think it is good we go to the back of the house, huh? That's a good idea. ‐ Hey, they just got Carlos. ‐ That's too bad. Go on. Get up on that roof. Here, let me help you. I'll be alright, Ms. Alice. You better get out of sight.
