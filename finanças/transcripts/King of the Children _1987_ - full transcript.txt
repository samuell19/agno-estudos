You've been here for seven years, right? Yes. Have you been in element with the farm? It depends Couldn't stand out among the others. Is life okay for you? You are a talent. Village Head, how come you are kidding me today? Just tell me what I can do for you. I'll do my best. I won't set you a task anymore. Don't let me down. Work hard. You know my third child. He doesn't study well. Please give him a hand. Beat him if he's not obedient. It's OK. I'll do so if you tell me. What are you doing? Ah? What's up? What did they ask you to do? Teaching. My missing is long drawn-out and my hatred is remote. My hatred will come to an end when I'm home. Where's Lao Gan? How did you make it? Are you telling us or not? Speak! Brothers, get him some cold water! Hold on! Any women around? Who cares! If I had sent gifts, I would be your... What? Say it! Seems becoming a teacher makes him gentle. Lao Gan, they're making you suffer like this, you really give in to them? It's boring for all of us. They just play fun with me. It's not bad. Lao Gan has a good temper. How did they ask you to be a teacher? How do I know? If you don't believe me, you can ask around. Just don't forget friends. If we pass by your school in the future, allow us to have a rest and drink a drop of water. Although I'm going to be a teacher, we have been suffering a lot together, I won't forget all of you. Come on, Lao Gan. If you have kids someday, and they'll surely be my students, I'll try all my efforts to teach them. Lao Gan, how come you become serious? We're familiar with each other for these years... Why, how come you didn't invite me for a drink together? It's Lai Di. Come on... You're about to teach? I hate to part with you. Fondle down along the face. Softly... You aren't fond of him until he's leaving? Do you want to be a cook in the school? Damn you! Don't be so impetuous. I'm more than a cook! I know musical notation and how to sing! Why can't I teach music in the school? Lao Gan, you know what I can do. I know... Ask for me after you go to the school. If there's a song with the numbered musical notation, I can let all the students sing it in half an hour. Cheers. - Cheers. - Good wine. Lao Gan, if you do me this favor, I would toast to you 10 more times. It's not your wine. How can you drink like this? What kind of do shit you value as a rarity? Several men drink so little wine for a while. No woman would like to be your wife! We won't want you anyway. You are a teacher now, why are you still holding a machete? Throw it away. Act like a teacher What's the matter with you? Wanna kill somebody? Oh, come in! It's you! I had one year at the senior high school before I came here and never had any teaching experience. I don't know whether I can make it. Drink some water. Lao Gan Students Put the machete on the desk. This is your room. A bed, and a desk here too... Holy shit! Hei Zi, bring me my hoe next time. I thought you'll lead an enjoyable life! How can it be enjoyable... ...in such a poor place. Well, it's a tough job. Not bad. Damn it! My god! Whose textbook is it? Is he sick or not? Of course he's sick. What kind of sickness? Nobody's sick. Teacher Li that had left didn't pay much attention to it. It's good for him not losing it. So do you. It's hard to find another if it's missing. This is the class schedule. Grade III of junior middle school. Which lesson should I start from? This semester just began. Maybe the first lesson... or the second lesson. Today, we have a new teacher... Be quiet! It's no good to make trouble! Today, we have a new teacher. Listen carefully! Stand up! Sit down. You shouldn't sit down without the teacher's permission. Class begins. Class begins. Sit down, please. Which lesson should we start from? - The first lesson... - The second... OK, let's turn to page four. Turn to page four. Turn to page four. Everyone! Hey, you! Where's your book? What book? No books. No books. Who's the monitor? Are you the monitor? Tell me, how can students attend classes without books? We don't have books. No books? How did you have classes before? Teacher Zhang, later Teacher Li hand-copied the texts on the blackboard every time. Then we hand-copied the texts on our notebooks. Didn't the school give you any book? Never? Be quiet! Officials have no chops. Students have no books. Learning is serious business! When I was a student... When I was a student, my first day of school... The very first thing was getting new books. Then I packed them nicely. Everyday I took them to school, and took out the right one in each class. Sit down, please. What else do you need? I need nothing. The school has forgotten to give the students books. I've forgot to tell you, no books at all. It's been the case all these years. Take some. Papering wall or wiping off shit, anything you like. Don't say like that. I've finished! Have you all finished? Yes! Finished... Since you finished copying the text, do you understand what the text means? The meaning of this text is obvious. It tells the story of a village. You! What's your opinion? I don't understand! Stand up! How can't you understand? It's simple. You are not a fool. What do I need a teacher for? It's your turn! I make it simple. A landlord sabotages production. The poor peasants see through his conspiracy. Finally the productivity improves. It's simple! Your turn! I make it simple. A landlord sabotages production. The poor peasants see through his conspiracy. Then... Well... Finally, the productivity improves. - Am I right? - Right! You've got a good memory! You are a terrible teacher. Just teach us what you should teach. First the new words, then how to divide the paragraphs, then the main ideas and the writing methods. I can teach better than you do. You must have done badly in the production team, so that have to make a living here. Stand up! Sit down please. Wang Fu! Yes. I'd like to tell you one thing first. You don't need to stand up from now on. We even have no books. No need to cross your hands behind. You can talk, and even leave if you have to. All of you grew up in the mountains, and now you're at Grade III. Wang Fu! Please sit down. Wang Fu, you said you could teach. Show me how to teach. Are you punishing me? No. I am a new teacher here, and got the textbook just before class. To be frank, I never taught before, although I know lots of words. I don't know what to teach you exactly. Please tell me... ...how Teacher Zhang and Teacher Li teach you. Come here, tell me which words you don't know. I don't know how many words have you learned. Come on. Underline all the words you don't know. OK! I will explain all underlined words. Teacher, there're still new words... OK, everyone! No wonder you're unable to read. Actually, you should have known... ...half of them at the primary school. Teacher, we haven't learnt the two words I underlined. I can prove it. OK, I will teach you all the words underlined, then sort out the real new words. All right Wang Fu! Wang Fu, you just said that you could prove the real new words. How? Look at this. The prize goes to... you're the son of Wang Qitong? I knew your father. We carried rice together. Your father is strong, but speaks little. Lao Wang's son... It's hard to correct students' homework. You must guess the words. Sometimes you have to stay very late to guess a few words. How about the students from your class? We're all under the leadership of the same schoolmaster. How could they have any difference? Don't say like that. Chinese defers from math anyway. There're unified rules... ...concerning paragraph dividing, paragraph main ideas and the theme. There's a model lesson plan in the county school. Would you need my help to transcribe it? My third child wrote to my hometown. We got a reply in less than three days. I asked him to read it for me. He stuttered from the beginning to the end. I didn't understand as well as him. You just mentioned the letter. It's a shame. Later he asked me to read the letter. I felt something's wrong with it. I asked him who's the grand uncle. He said he's not old enough to be a grand uncle. I told him this was to the grand uncle, then he felt his head. I understood immediately. The letter was returned by the post office and they thought it's a reply. The addresses were upside down! The words are illegible and I almost bit my tongue when I read it. Am I right? Don't say like that. I heard that you're teaching Grade III? Primary graduates are equivalent to Xiucai in the past. Junior graduates, Juren. Juren were extraordinary and people fawned on them! He's teaching Juren and he's great! Old man, your son will be a Juren too in the future. He has no such ability. Here's much more lively anyway. Aren't there female teachers in the school? They're too reserved. Too quiet and don't do anything at night. What do you expect them to do at night? My bed is not big enough for three persons. Then you go away. I will talk with the teacher. You're really teaching inside now. You've got fairer skin! Behave yourself! How noble! We working people can't even touch you. I know what's on your body even after you have taught for another 100 years! Pretending to be a gentleman! Who's pretending? I have a student named Wang Fu... ...who knows 3888 words. He gave me blushes right in the first class because of him. It was him who taught me how to teach later. How many words do you know? I'm known as a Junior graduate, actually didn't even finish the damned primary school. So how many do you think? Well, how many exactly? There's a young teacher when I was a student. His mother did job in making matchboxes with hands. She earned 46 cents for 1000 boxes to afford him to study. Later, he was reserved in the school as a teacher because of his good performance. He's too young and not good-looking, so the students didn't listen to him. Later he said, let's put aside all the other things, just talk about how many words do you know. Turn to any page of a small dictionary, if you could read, explain... ...and write all the words on this page, I would be completely convinced. You can do anything as you like in class. None of us believed it. He took out a dictionary... ...and let the us did so, all of the students were convinced. Nobody knew all the words on this page. Who has got a dictionary? Lost it long time ago. So did I. Who on earth would keep it? How could you be king of children if you don't have one? Forget it! I've got one. Show it to me. I have one condition. I don't want to be a village head. I don't want to be a director either. I just want to be a music teacher. How's that? Isn't a dictionary equal to a teacher? Even the real teacher doesn't have a dictionary! Why is it so important? It can be bought. You can't buy one here, anyway. You have to go downtown. None of the students have one. Talk to the school when you go back there, tell them there's a girl named Lai Di here, who can sing many songs. They can ask her to teach. I'm not the boss. How can I do that? How about you write the lyric and I compose the melody? You teach your class our song. I think it will make a difference. If your boss asks about it, you tell him Lai Di created it. If your boss is convinced by my ability, he'll definitely invite me to teach music lessons. Compose? Do you think it's a fun? It's art requiring professional skill. You must be a university graduate, at least. I think you're too arrogant. What's so difficult? Shut up! I often hum tunes. It is songs if you write down. Aren't they nice? Nice. Indeed. You're right. How many years had I been in school? But now I'm teaching Grade III. Juren! Am I right, old man? You can't explain anything in the world. It's hard to say. It's hard to say. Lao Gan, I agree. What are you doing? Won't you stay here tonight? It's late and dark. - There may be beasts. - I fear nothing! I have class tomorrow morning. Go back now. Take care. Who is it? What are you rushing for? Put down the hoe! It's you! It's late. Why are you here? Stop! I'm asking you, why didn't you say goodbye to me? We're such old friends, and I'll come back often. Are you serious with what you just said? What is it? We just said you're a gentleman. How come you forget what you just said? I see. You said about composnig a song. Didn't you initial this? - Whoever said it... - OK. I'll teach my class to sing this song. That will be unique. Done! I walk with you for a while, so we can discuss it. Don't behave like you're my elder sister. I'm older than you. All right! You write the lyric and I compose the melody. I'll do it secretly, convince Lao Hei and other people. I can do other things except cooking. OK. Let's do it. I must hurry now. Well, shall I escort you back home? Who needs your escort? Lao Gan! You keep this. - Don't you need it? - You need it. Lai Di! Goodbye! I can't recall how I come to school. You will recall it. You know well what you did yourself. You finished? All of you finished? Class dismissed. We'll talk about compositions next lesson. Go to play outside! Now I will read two compositions. Today's topic is Going to School. I'll read the first one... Going to School. To the classroom. I go to the classroom. I walk to school. That's all. Quiet! It's a good one. It's true. At least he used a word, "walk", so I understood that... ...he didn't run to school, or fly to school, or be carried to school. He walked to school by himself. Teacher, it's too short. It doesn't matter. You will make it longer and more understandable gradually. Teacher, whose composition is it? Yours. It doesn't matter who wrote this. OK! I'll read the second one written by Wang Fu. Going to School I don't have a clock. I got up. I put on my clothes. I washed my face. I went to the kitchen. I had my breakfast. I washed the bowl. I carried my bag. I didn't have a watch. How long have I walked? It's foggy in the mountains. I got school. I sat down. I had class. Don't laugh. You only need one I and everyone understands. He mentioned something and he saw fog. Too many commas. Yes. He used too many commas and it remains commas the whole article. However, this can be corrected. His article is excellent. Firstly, no spelling mistakes, and legible. Secondly, he did say something. Here's my requirement. Firstly, it must be legible. It doesn't matter whether your article's good or not. Secondly... No secondly, only firstly. Secondly... Teacher, didn't you just say there's no secondly? Secondly, don't copy the newspapers. Any copying is forbidden. Then what shall we do? You'll name a topic yourself, write whatever you want to. It doesn't matter how many words you use. But you must write honestly. - Am I clear? - Clear! You frightened me! - Goodbye, Teacher! - See you tomorrow! Goodbye, Teacher! What funny stuff did you read? You laughed the whole lesson. It's good to laugh. - What did you say? - I said it's good to laugh. Where are you from, kid? Do you go to school? No? Why not? I know how to read. Do you want me to teach you? Students! Have you known the schoolhouse is about to be repaired? Yes. Our class is in charge of getting 230 bamboo poles. That's too many! Bring machetes with you tomorrow morning. We'll go to the mountain right in the morning and carry them out in the afternoon. OK! Which village are we going? Our village... We're going to my village. I'm familiar there. We can cut as soon as we get there But it's a little far away from here. Boys should help the girls! No problem! We're as good as them. Who needs their help? Teacher, do we need to write a composition after that? Just work. Nothing else. Teacher Li used to ask for compositions. How about give us a topic? We can finish it today. In the case, you have to copy! I can finish it today without copying, believe it or not! Wang Fu, if the sun were to rise in the west, you could write down today what would happen tomorrow. Shall we bet on it? What bet do you want? You really wanna bet? Sure. The class will be the witness. - Is it OK? - All right! Wang Fu, what bet do you want? - Do you really want to bet? - Really. Tell me what you want. If I lose, you can ask anything from me. What do you want? Let the monitor keep it. The winner will take it tomorrow. - Have you had dinner? - Not yet. Going to cut bamboo tomorrow? How are you doing? Fine. Could you lend me your dictionary? I'm writing something, but forget a word from "fail to live up to". What are you writing? Lyrics. Lyrics? Fail to live up to... I remember you've got one. I bet with Wang Fu. The witness keeps it. Bet? What for? We bet on the bamboo cutting. You remain the old bad habit. What's the need to bet with a student? They won't be obedient any more if you lose. Why should be obedient? They're smart kids. The higher authorities knew about that... ...you don't teach according to the textbook. The school has no problem with that. But you shouldn't go further. Teacher, I win. What? Dad, my teacher said he knew you. Lao Wang Don't you remember me? We carried rice together. Lao Wang, Wang Fu is a good student. My Dad and I went to chop bamboos before dark. I wrote the composition after we cut 230 bamboo poles. I finished it before midnight. It's at home now. An educated youth can prove it. Good, Wang Fu. You certify it, and I win the dictionary. Wang Fu! Wang Fu, I give it to you as a gift, not for the bet. We had a deal that... ...you wrote about the work today. Although you wrote the composition yesterday, you worked yesterday too. You can only record a thing after it has happened. It's a common sense. You're a very conscientious kid and have done so much for the class. I give the dictionary to you. I lose! Please give it to Wang Fu! Wang Fu, go back home. Lao Gan! Lao Gan! Lao Gan, Glorious people's teachers. Don't just stand there. Give us a lesson. Who shout stand up? I'll do. Stand up! Be quiet! Cross your hands behind. It's no good to make trouble! Class begins. Today's lesson is very important. Please pay attention. First I will read the text once. There was once a mountain. The mountains there was a temple. There was an old temple monk telling a story. What was the story? There was once a mountain. The mountains there was a temple.

None of your business! OK. Let's move. Are you punishing this student? Wang Fu, it's time for dinner. This is Wang Fu. You're hardworking. No wonder your teacher often praises you. Are you doing the homework? No. I'm copying the teacher's dictionary. Copying the dictionary? Damn it. It's my dictionary. Damn you. I didn't say it's not yours. Do you copy everyday? Do you stay so late every night? It's not late. Not late? Your home is far from here. Not far. We all walk back. Your teacher told me about the dictionary. Here, it's yours now. Wang Fu, take it! This is the real owner. No, I'd rather copy. It makes me learn better. What's the use after finish copying? I will work at the village after graduate. I'll take it. I will copy again if there's bigger dictionary in the future. Teacher, the vegetables are washed. I'm going back for dinner. Why not have dinner here? No, I'm going back. Teacher, I'm leaving. What did you call me? Lai Di, I just don't know... ...if I'm right to teach in such way. We have written many things that we're familiar with. Today, write about a person you're familiar with. Every person is a living soul. It's difficult to write. Have a try. See what else more you can write. Teacher, I'm going to write about the cook at our village. OK. Teacher, I want to write about drivers. You can do so if you are familiar with. Teacher, I'll write about you. Me? I've been here for only a few months. Have you known me well? Do you know whether I snore or not? OK, go ahead. Stay for a while after class. I'd like to teach you a wonderful song. There he is. This is Secretary Wu from the higher authority. He wanna talk to you. I heard that you bet with your student. Which lesson are you having now? I didn't teach the textbook. Why not? It's useless. Cigarette? No, thanks. Have you all finished? Teacher. OK. Wang Fu, read yours to us. Come on. My Father. My father is the strongest man in the world. He carries sacks at the village, and no one can match him. My father is also the biggest eater in the world. My mother makes sure that he can have enough. She's right, because my father has to work... ...and make a living for the whole family. But my father once said... ...he's not as strong as Wang Fu, because Wang Fu can read. My father speaks little, but I can understand him. I wanna study hard, and speak for him. My father works very hard. He's been ill today. He got up slowly later and went to work. He didn't want to lose one day's payment. I'm still at school, so I can't replace him. The sun rose in the morning. My father walked into the white sunlight. I think my father is strong again. I'm wondering if you still remember, once I wrote a word on the blackboard, and Wang Fu underlined it. Then I wiped it. I once herded cattle at the village. Cattle are very stubborn. Whether you hit or curse them, they just winked... ...and ate what they like. But cattle panic sometimes. That is when I pee. They are fond of salty things and urine is salty. They rarely have the chance to eat urine. Sometimes I held back my urine before herding... One day I saw a boy pee, and fed the cattle with urine. Girls need more practice. Sing slowly. One, two, three, four, five. Grade III class live a bitter life to know more than three thousand words. After graduation, they can read. Five, four, three, two, one. Grade III class make a good showing. Heads are on the shoulders. Write composition by yourself. One, two, three, four, five. Grade III class live a bitter life to know more than three thousand words. After graduation, they can read books. Five, four, three, two, one. Grade III class make a good showing. Heads are on the shoulders. Write composition by yourself. I'd like to take the students' compositions, is there any problem? You're right that don't make trouble. Make trouble... What? Am I right? Right. There will be mountain burning. It's good looking. I've been here for seven years. I can't remember how many times I've seen it. Wang Fu, don't ever copy anything again, not even a dictionary. There was once a mountain.
