(MUSIC PLAYING) ADULT TOM: ( NARRATING) 1941 was a momentous year in the history of the small industrial city of Belfast. It's remembered by many as the year war came to our shores, bringing horrific terror and unimaginable destruction. But not for me, Tom Hall. And that's because the contents of a wooden crate making its way across the sea to our shores was about to make that year simply the most unforgettable year of my life. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (BOAT HORN BLOWS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (ELEPHANT GRUNTS) (BOAT HORN BLOWING) (TRUMPETS) (ELEPHANT TRUMPETING) The zoo is closed today, ladies and gentlemen. (ALL GASP AND MUTTER) Yes, just while we settle the elephant. Come back another day. No, no, you got no business being here today. Off you go. Not today. Not today, moppet. Moppet. Goodbye. Goodbye. (WHISTLING) (LOCK CLICKS, GATE CREAKS OPEN) (MAN CROONING ON RECORDING) (TYPEWRITER CLACKING) Would you like to meet him? Come on. (GROANS AND SNARLS) He's perfect. (LAUGHS) Is he okay? (HEARTBEAT THUDS) Just fine. (ROARS GENTLY) (LAUGHS) GEORGE: Oh. You're the first person he's done that to. Got a special touch, eh? Chip off the old block? SHAWCROSS: Special touch indeed. This one's had a difficult time where he's come from, and needs considerable attention. And that's what we do best here in Belfast Zoo. Sir, Tom has a name for him. TOM: Buster. Well, yes, I-I-I suppose we needed someone to name him. Nobody better I'd say, eh, sir? Yes, quite, yes. Oh, well, very well, then. Carry on. (BUSTER SNARLS) (BIRDS TWEET) (SQUEAKS) (CHIRPING AND SQUAWKING) I knew you'd choose Buster. (RADIO DIAL TURNING) NEWSCASTER: (ON RADIO) Orders have been issued this evening at 1600 hours as a precaution, calling up officers and men of the Anti-Aircraft and coast defense units of the Territorial Army. This is, as yet, not a measure of general mobilization to include the Territorial Army. (CLOCK TICKING) (AIR RAID SIREN WAILING) As a further precaution, officers and men on leave from the Royal Air Force and the defense units of the Auxiliary Air Force, and also the Observer Corps... (HEAVY BREATHING) (GIRL SOBBING SOFTLY) (AIR RAID SIREN WAILS) There's no use crying. Every morning we'll be doing this drill. I expect everyone to be in attendance. Bombs or no bombs, this school remains open. War does not halt education. Any questions? Uncle Hughie's going off to win the war, sir. That's great, Peter. I'm sure there'll be lots of men... Auntie Ethna says she'll be glad at the peace. We all want peace. Oh, no, sir. She means from Uncle Hughie. (KIDS SNICKER) Right. No more silliness now, Peter. (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) Have you not heard? (INAUDIBLE) We've been called up. I go Friday. This happened to me when I was your age. My Grandpa Bill went off to war. He sat me down, too. I'll be coming home in no time. Grandpa didn't. Look after him for me, won't you? (DOG BARKING) I'd say a couple of tons or so. He's just a small one. Still, you're in charge? - Ow! - Ah! (BOYS LAUGH) So this is new elephant I heard you lying all about, Hall? Leave him alone. You need a girl to save you, Hall? JANE: Just leave him. - VERNON: Or what? - You'll tell your DA? Piss-head the drunk. Classic. Well, Hall? I've been asked to look after an animal too. TOM: What happened to it? We found it outside Wi... I killed it, what happened. Outside witch woman's house. She'll hardly miss one of her millions of stinking animals. (BOTH LAUGH) VERNON: Let's leave this weirdo. Oh, sorry. Sorry. (THUMPING OVERHEAD) CHARLIE: Oi, oi! Get back here, you toe rag! TOM: Hi, Charlie! Hey, Adam. Hey, John. - Hello, Tom! - Hello! (ALL SQUAWKING) (LION ROARS) Come here, Gilbert. Come on. That's it. Still got it, old boy. Hey. Hey. (CLAPS HANDS) (ALL GIBBERING) (GROWLS SOFTLY) Like that, don't you? SHAWCROSS: All right. Here we are. What are you doing in here? Oh, this is Jake. He's replacing your father. Apprentice vet, Lockleys. Nice to meet you. Here for Buster? Proper vet, Tom. Apprentice. (GROWLS) What's that? It's medicine. You allow him in here, sir? - Dad said he's fine. - JAKE: Well... one a day keeps the doc away. Do you want me to...? This isn't some wee pet rabbit, son. Now, give us our cloth. (ROARS AND SNARLS) Dad usually does it by... This one isn't backward at coming forward. Dad always warms it up first. (BUSTER SNARLS) VERNON: Behind that door is a real-life witch. Listen. (ANIMALS SQUEAKING AND CHIRPING) Her house is full of stinking animals and birds. And you know what? She keeps them for one reason. (CHOMPS) For eating. (GASPS) She eats them birds, rats, rabbits, the lot. Now you are going to throw that against her door right now. Throw it. (ALL LAUGH) (MUTTERING) (CHILDREN LAUGHING DISTANTLY) (ANIMALS SQUEAKING) It's not safe out here, little fella. Mrs. Austin? Hello? Hello, Mrs. Austin? (BIRD SQUAWKS) Shoo, bunny.

Trespasser, get out. - But your door pushed open. - It can't have. Get out. I was just returning your guinea pig. You evil... No, I didn't. (MRS. AUSTIN GRUNTS) I would never harm an animal.

(COINS CHINK) (EXHALES) (COINS CLATTER) Hey. Go on. Enjoy them. Won't be here much longer. I was worried about you last night. Were you frightened? (TRUMPETS) (DOOR OPENS) We've a lot to organize today. SHAWCROSS: Yes, I'm afraid so. Why aren't you at school? Are the animals being moved or something? - Charlie said... - Tom. Go now, please. Your father doesn't work here anymore. (BUSTER GROWLS) What are you doing? Oh... tying grass or something. You really in charge of that new elephant? Aye. My dad's away to war. What's your dad do? He... he's going to war, too. Want to see a picture? Picture of what? Picture. In the picture house. You've never seen a picture on the big screen? You coming or what? (PROJECTOR WHIRRING) NEWS NARRATOR: ( ONSCREEN) Today was, beyond question, the most costly for the German Air Force for nearly a month. Up to 10:00 this morning, 175 German aircraft have been destroyed in raids over this country. Approximately 400 enemy aircraft were launched in two devastating attacks against London and southeast England. Officials estimate over half of them were successfully shot down. (RAGTIME PIANO MUSIC PLAYS) (MAN GROANING AND MUTTERING) Oh, I-I better... Yeah. (MAN GRUNTS AND YELLS) Get in that house, ye! (DOG BARKS) (CHILDREN CHATTER INDISTINCTLY) (BELL CLANGING) You keep your damn piehole shut. - What? - You know what. Last night. You saw my brother, you turd. Nobody knows about him. I won't tell.

I'm here now. (KEYS JINGLE) ZOOKEEPER: So, what do we do with Buster? JAKE: He wasn't on the list, but it doesn't look good. (GROANS AND TRUMPETS) Shh, Buster. You have to be quiet now. Get out. (BUSTER TRUMPETS) You stay away. I saw you. You killer. It was a government directive. We had to do it in case the animals escaped during the bombings. If they bomb again, you'll bring the guns back? - Will you? - Tom, I have to follow orders. Stay away from me and Buster. Why didn't you go to war? Too frightened? Only thing you can shoot is poor, defenseless animals? You don't know shit, boy. Now, get the hell out of here. (BUSTER ROARS) What are you going to do? Shoot me too? Go on. If anything happens to Buster, anything, I promise... (TRUMPETS) (EXHALES) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Emily? I saw your Tom at the entrance. Tom? He was there five minutes ago. Tom? What are you doing here, son? What happened? You're bleeding. They shot the animals, Mum. What are you talking about, love? In the zoo. They shot loads. The gunmen will come back if they bomb again. Nurse Hall. You're required on Ward Five. Stay away from that zoo. Do you hear me? (SIGHS) (FOLIAGE RUSTLES) What are you doing here again? What are you doing here again? Tom. What's wrong? Did you not hear? They shot the animals in the zoo. Lots of them. Because of the bombs. Did they... shoot Buster? Not yet. But if they come back... Buster will get... I have to get him out. Tom. Could I help? NEWSCASTER: (ON RADIO) Sixty-two thousand Empire troops have now arrived in Greece, including the British First... (RADIO CLICKS OFF) TOM: "They went from cage to cage shooting the big cats. Jake helped, too. He shot Gilbert. They even shot Hugo the giant rat. Not the birds, monkeys, reptiles and some others. You would've stopped them, Dad. But I couldn't." Shh. It's only me. I'm sorry about the animals. Send Dad my letter, Mum. He needs to know. I will. (WHISPERS) Go to sleep, son. (GATE RATTLING) (TOM GRUNTS) JANE: It's not even budging. And how we going to get him past the guard anyway? That's why we have to get this gate open. Charlie doesn't even know it's here, so it's the safest way to get Buster out. We need to do it before the weekend. Last raid was at the weekend, so I'm thinking Hitler does weekends, when everyone's home. Okay. How long can we keep him there? Until my dad gets home. Until the war is over? That could be a while, Tom. What if somebody finds Buster there? They won't. Nobody will ever find my place. I've been going there for years. I found it. Yeah, but me and you are... a bit different. Tom, we aren't strong enough. I will get that gate open. Tom, we need help. (SIGHS) We can't. Nobody can know. I'm not saying adult help. CHILDREN: Patty-cake, patty-cake, baker's man... - BOY: No, no. - TOM: Who, Pete? No chance. He's a nutcase. But he's strong, Tom. (BOY GRUNTS) (PETE LAUGHS) (MUMBLING INDISTINCTLY) You two lovebirds writing love letters? Right, come on. Out to the yard with the rest of the children. We are not lovebirds, Tom. All I'm saying is, unless you've got a better idea... (GRUNTS AND PANTS) I don't trust him. Buster won't care about you trusting Pete... whenever the gunmen come back. They must be planning for another raid. MISS RAINEY: They're checking everybody's gas masks work. Right, you two next. And no messing, Peter. PETE: Yeah, yeah. I promise, I won't. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (LOUD RATTLING) TOM: You okay? PETE: Sweet Jesus, are there snakes in here too? Surely this isn't on the curriculum. - TOM: What? - PETE: This! Gassing the pupils. I mean, gassed by your own teachers? TOM: Pete, uh, do you want to help me with something? Me and Jane, we need someone strong. PETE: You and Jane? Come on, Jane. JANE: Did you ask him, Tom? Are you helping Tom with something? Might be. Why? Tom's an animal-loving weirdo! (CHILDREN LAUGH) Do you want me to help, Jane? That'd be a delight. Hold on. Did you just say that I'd be shite? I'd love you to help, Pete. MISS RAINEY: Back to your seat, Vernon. Vernon? (SCHOOL BELL CLANGS) I'm in. We all have to do it. Right now. (INHALES AND EXHALES DEEPLY) (SHAKY BREATHING) We have to be sure we can trust you, Pete. I swear on my mother, my father, my Uncle Sammy, my Aunt Lydia, my... my go-kart, my Meccano, my... Hey, look, Pete, there's an eagle. (GASPS) You... (ALL GRUNT) (PETE LAUGHS) What about the streetlamps? Lamps won't be on. Curfew. - Tom? - What? We should wear dark clothes. No, I don't even have dark clothes. Great idea. - Tom? - What, Pete? We should bring our gas masks. - Tom? - BOTH: What, Pete? Will Buster need a gas mask or something? Well, he can breathe, can't he? What if he decides he doesn't want to come with us? Have you ever walked an elephant before? He will. I have a special touch. But I bet he's strong, though. We're going to need an adult to help us. - No. - No, Pete. That's why we have you. Okay, Tom. It's just, I thought the real reason I was recruited was, well, you know... Definitely not.

(CAT MEOWING DISTANTLY) (DOG BARKING) I didn't even hear you, Jane. You're like a ghost. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH) I'm sorry I'm late. I'm not great in the dark. Oh, yeah. I had to bring my brother. He was making too much noise when I was getting up. He would have woken my mother, and she'd have killed me. It's fine. Hi. PETE: His name is... My name is Mickey. He thinks because I'm like this that this doesn't work. Hi, Mickey. I didn't even know that you had a-- - He didn't tell you? - You told me not to, Pete. And I keep my word. I don't really talk about Mickey. People laugh at him just because he's different. Tell me a kid that isn't different. I'd say he's more different than me. Don't worry. We'll be much faster when he's on my back. He likes to wander off. - Jane! - JANE: Come on, you two. - Do what? - Stop. What are you two doing out here? What are you doing out here? Sorry, misters.

(BUSTER ROARS) Holy sweet Jesus and the apostles. It's okay. He's really tame. That's a bloody elephant. I need help. You got your own home, haven't you? I can't take him home. My dad works at the zoo. He'd be sacked. Well, you can't keep him here. You're not my responsibility. You like animals. I had nowhere else to go. Please, just, until my dad gets back from war. Let me and Buster in and I'll explain. Please. (ROARS) (BUSTER ROARS) Will you stop that damn noise! It's the middle of the night, for God's sake! She's as blind as a cat. (BIRDS CHIRP) JANE'S FATHER: Jane! You better get in this house! Jane! Where are you? (GLASS BOTTLE SHATTERS) How can you let a two-ton elephant simply vanish, Charlie? Animals do not vanish from my zoo. The public must be informed. Did you sleep well? You seem tired. Where were you last night, son? Just out. Did you get the dinner I left out for you? Bye! Mum, did Dad... (DOOR CLOSES) (SIGHS) Reply yet? JANE: We never found Mickey. We looked everywhere. Where's Pete now? Don't know. Probably still looking. (TOM SIGHS) Jane, there was a slight change of plan last night. PETE: Quick. We are so dead. We are so dead. What's he saying? He's telling them about Buster. Oh, we're so dead. - PETE'S MOTHER: Goodbye. - OFFICER: Goodbye. Peter, Mickey is not allowed to play with the swans in the lagoon anymore. I'm sorry, Mother. It was... Wait. Swans?

(ALL LAUGH) (BUSTER TRUMPETS) I seem to have... made some... little friends. And a large one. (CHUCKLES) (DOG BARKS) We'll need a lot more straw. Oh, just leave it in there. (BUSTER GRUNTS) May I? Yes. (BIRDS CHIRP) Would you like me... to do your hair? It's all right if not. You have beautiful hair. Ever been to the zoo, Mrs. Austin? It's okay. I've only been once, with Tom. It's just, with these knees... and that hill. - You look nice. - Thanks. - You want me to do yours? - No, no, no. Thank you, love. If you ever need your hair brushed again... or anything else... don't you hesitate from coming down here. We girls. (BUSTER GROANS) You okay, Buster? What is wrong? Are you feeling okay, Buster? It's all right. It's okay. It's okay, Buster. It's okay. Good boy. (KEYS JIGGLE) (DOOR CLOSES) (FOOTSTEPS) I thought you were at work. From your dad. Yours is on the other side. Is this all he sent? I think he did well. He's not the writing type. He said nothing about the zoo. Well, maybe he hasn't got your letter yet. Anyway, you should be happy to hear from your father. No, Mum. Maybe you only care about people. But I care about animals, too. Of course I care. I have to work. I've no choice, son. People really need nurses at the minute. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. This isn't your fault. This is war, son. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for this whole mess. You are not responsible for that zoo. Your father wouldn't want that. (GROANS) TOM: Buster, you need to eat. Eat, Buster, please. Buster, you're going to get sick if you don't eat. See if he'll eat these. (POUNDING ON DOOR) WARDEN 1: There have been multiple calls to date from your neighbors, all saying there's strange noises coming from your backyard. WARDEN 2: Strange noises coming from your backyard. MRS. AUSTIN: They're bloody animals. They're going to make a noise. WARDEN 1: We have orders, missus. We're looking for an elephant. May we come in? MRS. AUSTIN: No, you can't. WARDEN 1: This here is the veterinarian from the zoo. I don't care where he comes from, you're not coming in. Oh! Oh, how dare you? How dare you force yourselves into my property? This is disgraceful. JAKE: I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm Jake McClune. MRS. AUSTIN: This is a disgrace! Bertie, look at that. Hey. It's like a zoo in here. Like a zoo. So sorry, Tom. (HOOTING) WARDEN 1: Well, don't you need a license for all these? WARDEN 2: She needs a license... or something. No. They're all just household pets. So, what'll happen to this elephant, if found? If they find that elephant, they'll destroy it. (BELL RINGING) So much for your new elephant keeper job, Hall. A reward for its capture, too. There's an elephant out there, Hall. And we are going to find it. A big fat reward. We'll be rich. Pete won't help Vernon to find him. It's not Vernon I'm worried about. Everybody will be looking for Buster. JANE: "Having been forced to admit the disappearance of the elephant, a red-faced Mr. Shawcross, zoo manager, has offered a substantial reward for any information leading to the recovery of the elephant." We're going to be so famous. "Of grave concern is the fact that Buster suffers from elephant degenerative disease due to maltreatment in his previous location. If not treated, the condition can be fatal. The public are warned not to approach the elephant, but to immediately inform the police." MRS. AUSTIN: Poor thing. One a day keeps the doc away. The medicine. Jake was giving it to him from the cupboard. We have to go back in. Oh, no, no, no, no. There's no way we're going back in there. My nerves just couldn't take that again. MRS. AUSTIN: If I could take your place, Pete, I would. We go in tonight. Maybe I should go in alone. They'll be on high alert. JANE: Not a chance. Buster's ill, and we're a team. (DOOR CLOSES) There's always hard times, Buster. But you'll get through it. No matter how hard things get, the birds always sing in the morning. I always tell myself that.

Tom, why didn't you ask me? MISS RAINEY: Tom? Can you come here, please? Peter, take a seat, please. (INDISTINCT MURMURING) (INAUDIBLE) We pray for the men and women who helped the injured. And we pray for the brave firemen from all over Ireland who came to help us. MRS. AUSTIN: Our very brave little friend Jane Berry died last night in the bombings. She was only a few yards from home. Maybe now... the troubled little soul... will have... peace. (BUSTER ROARS) TOM: She adored her dad. It's not your fault, son. Jane never had a real family... like you have. You gave her some fun in her little life. That's what you did. You made her part of something, something very special. You also made me a part of something very special, something I'll never forget. Tom... it's not your fault. Some malt and jam. Your favorite. (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) (BIRD SQUAWKS) MRS. AUSTIN: He's perking up. Pete. He blames me for Jane. Tom? You have a job to finish. A job you bravely started. She was the only brave one. Too many terrible things have happened, and too many people have been hurt. You and us have to make sure that not a single hair on Buster's back is harmed. TOM: We have to finish this. - For Jane. - That's right. Who's that? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. No. It's just a letter. A letter from my son. You've got a son? Had a son. He was a brave soldier in the Great War. This is the last photograph I have of him. And the last letter from him. He used to write me every week. He used to write on everything he could lay his hands on. This one... this one here, it's written on a Gitanes packet. Did you write back to him? Of course. Still do. I post him a letter every week. How did your son...? A bomb hit their camp in Belgium. I'm sorry. There's not a day goes by when I don't have a think about him. But I'm all right. I've got my animals to keep me company now. The strange thing... I always picture him at your age. Very like him in many ways, Tom. Oh! Hello, Pete. He's looking better. (DOG BARKS DISTANTLY) What? You tell me what. Where were you? I was just walking about, you know. Looking for something bad to do. Yeah, well, I was looking for you. Hey! I said I was looking for you. Yeah, well, you found me. (GRUNTS) TOM: There you go, Buster. Good boy. Good boy. He ate a whole cart full. (BUSTER ROARS) Bingo. PETE: I went back to the tree the other day with Mickey, and repainted our three initials and added Mickey's. I hope that's okay with you, Tom. TOM: Of course it's okay, Pete. Did you repaint it with your blood? PETE: Are you kidding? No. Painted it with my Meccano pen. (PETE CHUCKLES) WOMAN: Come on, you two. (DOOR CREAKS OPEN) - PETE: Tom? - TOM: Yeah, Pete? - PETE: I never want those initials to fade. - TOM: Neither do I. - WOMAN: How was that? - You all right? I saw the elephant, Hall. That's right. I saw it. And you know what? Not only am I going to get a fat reward and get famous, but you're dead when the police find out you were involved, Hall. And your dad'll be sacked! Pete, why are you speaking to him? What are you? Deaf and dumb like your dopey brother? Pete... Petey? I didn't mean... Never, ever speak about my brother again. HEADMASTER: Come here, you. (CHILDREN APPLAUD) (CHILDREN, CHANTING) Pete! Pete! Pete! Pete! Pete! (FOOTSTEPS RUNNING) I found the elephant! Hello? Misters? I found the elephant! (CHAIN RATTLES) (WHEEZING) TOM: You okay? JAKE: Could you reach me that? (LABORED BREATHING) (PANTING) One a day keeps the doc away. I guess now you know why I never made it to war. (SIGHS) I... I need to talk. (KNOCK ON DOOR) Hopefully... hopefully these will help him get... Hello again, ma'am. TOM: It's okay. He's part of our team now. Let's finish what we started. EMILY: Tom? What? Look. ADULT TOM: ( NARRATING) Shortly after the last devastating raid, the Allied forces took control of the skies. It was then we knew our job was done. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (MICKEY LAUGHING) Hello. "Awsofer," I need to report something. Shh. Repeat that? JAKE: (OVER PHONE) It's the zoo vet here. - The elephant has returned. - The what has returned? JAKE: Buster. The missing elephant? - How? - JAKE: Don't know? What? JAKE: It's a mystery. It just returned? JAKE: Yes, officer. Buster's here now. You can call off the search... You will not believe what has just reappeared. I need to talk to somebody about the missing elephant. That missing elephant is... no longer missing. Okay. EMILY: It's in my dresser drawer. The green leather one. ADULT TOM: ( NARRATING) Shortly after we returned Buster, I discovered my letters to Dad. Unsent. EMILY: Did you find it, Tom? The little gray one. ADULT TOM: I decided my mum's secret should be kept a secret. And I grew to understand why she never sent the letters. PETE: She's heavy. Whose idea was this anyway? I heard that. I'm sorry, boys, but I like my Paris buns. ADULT TOM: Sometime later, Charlie was reinstated to his rightful place. CHARLIE: You're going to have to pay, just like everyone else. ADULT TOM: And he quickly returned to his old self. No problem, Charlie. It's Mister to you. Oh, grow up, Mister. (KIDS SNICKERING) Have a wonderful afternoon. MRS. AUSTIN: Oh, look, boys. Flamingos. - TOM: I know. - PETE: I know. Oh, look, a giraffe! PETE & TOM: We know. (BUSTER ROARING) MRS. AUSTIN: Oh, Lord. There's my little boy. (TRUMPETS) He has grown. (LAUGHS) ADULT TOM: There were two major bombing raids on Belfast. Over a thousand souls lost their lives. A while later, Dad returned safely from the war. Pete, against all odds, went on to become a doctor in London, specializing in children with disabilities. We write to each other often. And he tells me Mickey is as bossy as ever. Mrs. Austin died peacefully in her sleep in 1962, finally and eternally reunited with her beloved son. I visit Jane's grave every year on her birthday and retell her the story of how we saved an elephant. Well done, son. I'm proud of you. ADULT TOM: Dad is going strong. Still working up at the zoo. And still my hero. (TRUMPETS) Me? There was only one place in the whole world I wanted to work. (BUSTER TRUMPETS) (CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)
