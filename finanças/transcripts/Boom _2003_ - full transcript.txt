Who's this? Just a moment. Shiela, there's a call for you on my phone. Rina... Just a minute. Did you really win the Nobel Prize? You're smart for sure. So what's your name? I knew it. Hey, Anu. You look stunning and beautiful. Get ready, darling. I'll be right back. I think you should tie your hair like this. Honestly, you look gorgeous. Then why is she the opening model of your show? Oh, Michelle, I promise you'll be the opening model for my next show. You'll open my next show. Okay, darling? -To hell with you. -Ouch! -How dare you push me! -Anu, let go of her. Let her go! -Let go! -Let go of her! What are you doing? Boom What a bitch! Anu Gaekwad, age, 27 years. She is the only child and she's from Santa Cruz, Mumbai. As a kid, she loved to run cross-country races and swimming. But she was too sexy to be a sportsperson. She's the first Indian to finish second in the Miss Universe pageant. She speaks English as if it's her mother tongue. When she speaks Marathi, it seems she's speaking Italian. She's a hothead. Don't mess with her. Did you guys read this? It says, some valuable diamonds were stolen from a Hyderabad museum. Everyone's looking for us. The CBI wants to take us in for questioning. I think we're screwed. Rina Kaif, age, 20 years. She's still a kid. She is known by many names, Pokti, Chinchpokli and Chiki. She's half British, half Kashmiri. A girl with no permanent residence. She's not fluent in any language. She doesn't know where she is going in her life. But she is really adorable. You shouldn't have hit her. You should've kept out of it! I wasn't trying to save her. I was trying to push you two apart. -Why did you push her? -You were the one who started it. Knock it off, both of you. She pushed me purposely! It's all in your head. Why would she push you when she knew she was hiding diamonds in her hair? Diamonds? Who is she? Was she in the show? Diamonds, Rina. Diamonds! A girl's best friend! Understood? What? Were they real diamonds? In her hair? What was she thinking? I don't give a damn about that. I wanna know what she was up to. Shiela Bardez, age, 27 years. Part Goan, part Keralite. A complete mess. She divides her time between New York and Mumbai. She can speak nine languages and she's very smart. One day a guy whistled at her and that's when she realized she is sexy. She has a bright and sharp mind. After the show, Michelle boarded a plane to Dubai. -Why? -Courier service. If you don't get a timely delivery, you'll get your money back. I don't understand. Why did she hide diamonds in her hair? Dear Rina, she was smuggling diamonds from Mumbai to Dubai. Do you get it now? Anu, what do we do now? In order to get out of this mess, we would have to buy every copy of every newspaper in this city. It's business. You were desperate when you wanted money. Now, when it's time to pay me back, you're shying away? I want the money by evening. Or I'll ask Boom to have you skewered like a pig. Problem. No. Problem, huh? She looks delicious. She is... She's our... Michelle. She kicked up a row at the fashion show. She lost all the 30 diamonds. The diamonds were all over the place from Malabar Hill to Pali Hill. -No idea. -Really? -Really. -What? The girl! Why am I reading this in the newspaper? Why do I own 10 phones? It's all show, isn't it? Tell me! Michelle... She has vanished. Flew the coop. We're up the shit creek without a paddle.

He is still the same. He has flings with all the maids from Pali Hill to Malabar Hill. These days, he is messing up my business. I don't know how to deal with him. Smart-ass! Medium Mia here. Hello, Abdul here. You're such a moron! You bloody idiot! You raised your share from from 10% to 50%! -But... -What about Michelle and the diamonds? About them... Have you read today's Times Of India? Why? -What's so special? -Everything's in a mess! There's chaos everywhere. If you can't handle the business in Mumbai I'll have to come down from Dubai. Medium Mia, Saleem Suiting Shirting, don't you worry. I'll take care of everything here. Abdul Fifty-Fifty, such an idiot! Bade... Have you seen Bo Derek's picture in today's newspaper? I have to call Bo. Call Bo. Bo? Bo. Bo Derek. And... Medium. I want my diamonds back. All of them. Michelle is on the run. That idiot, Fifty-Fifty, has done nothing about it. Saleem Ahmad, 45. My adopted younger brother. Aka Saleem Cut Piece Suiting Shirting, but he is famous as Medium Mia. Neither too big nor too small. Just Medium. His parents died in the Mumbai riots, so my family adopted him. He's a backstabber. Had he not been my younger brother, I would have killed him a long time ago. So do you think...

Today, I dance to his tunes so that some day, he might dance to mine. I don't make coffee. Enough is enough. I can't do it anymore. I don't understand what's going on. I can't do this anymore. You gals think I don't know what's going on. And what do you know, Bharati? I know everything. I also watch TV and read newspapers. What are you talking about? It's not just me. The entire neighborhood is talking about it. They don't believe I work day and night for lousy 3000 rupees. Irrespective of knowing the fact that you have the diamonds! Whatnot! -Whatnot? -What? Whatnot? What's that? Bharati, we don't have the diamonds. Had we gotten diamonds, we would've worn them. You know us for many years now. How long have you been working here? Two years or something. How come we never met your husband and family? Do you have a boyfriend? What? I'm Shankar. Boom Shankar. What's your name? What's your problem with us? What's your problem with us? What's your problem with us? What's your problem with us? What's your problem with us? What's my problem with you? Let me enlighten you. Ms Anu Gaekwad... Thanks to you and these bimbos here... I've lost 18th-century diamonds. 30 diamonds. I stole them from the Government of India. A few shutterbugs and scribes from Chinchpokli and Chikmagalur stole them from me. That's my problem with you. Miss Rina Kaif. Mother, Englishwoman. Father, Kashmiri. He's a doctor in London. You've been living here with these two models for the last six months. You don't know the difference between brain and breasts. Do you want your share too? Family address, numbers the whole nine yards. I know your favorite color, boyfriend, height, weight. Your size is 32B, right? They are 34. It's 32. I can see that. Sorry. So we are screwed, right? Absolutely. We made a mistake. What can we do for you? What can you do? What do we do now? Ma, what do you think? What do I know? I know nothing besides cooking and making tea. Where do you think you are going? To make tea. Put some clove and cardamoms. Cloves and cardamoms? I am no supermarket. What should I do? Why are you asking me? Ask them to put on some dresses and walk the ramp. Call some people and steal it again. That's it! I like her idea! Fashion and extortion. Now, Abdul Fifty-Fifty will be happy. I'm always happy. Boom. How are you? Abdul, is everything fine? Don't you worry. Follow me. Yes, this side. Walk faster. Come on, my beauties. Send me the protection money. I've killed your watchman. I'll bomb your shop tomorrow. Patel Seth, is that you? When did you come back? Where are you? Have you got fajita? Yes, sure. Excellent. Bro, I'm doing your job. It's done. Don't you worry. Trouble others, but don't get in trouble. Hey, who gave you my number? Who gave it to you? Ask him to call me! How are you, Sana Seth? You have to transfer the money. Just 2.5 million rupees. Make sure you get it done. What are you wearing? What are you wearing inside? Pink? See you later. I've got some people here. See you. Wow! It's so hot in Mumbai... and yet you roam around fully clothed? Sir, we are very sorry that we have ruined your import-export business. It was an accident. As you know, accidents happen. Import-export business! Do you know the value of a single diamond? Diamond? Yes, you know, diamonds. Diamonds are a girl's best friends. Hey, calculate the loss. The loss is difficult to evaluate. Try anyway, a ballpark figure. I can't put up with him anymore. So, according to my judgment... the price would be between 500 million to one billion rupees. The price depends on the buyer. Wait, I'll tell you the buyer's name. Bade Mia. He's a big man! If there's a list of the most dangerous men, he would top that list. We're sorry, we had no clue. Please forgive us. How would you know? See, it's not my problem. It is your problem. Shankar, how much are they worth? We can get around 800,000 for the gal in the pink. She is a delicate darling, untouched and unblemished. This NRI, hip, fashionable model will fetch us around 600,000. This Maharashtrian girl will bring us around 400,000. Why? -Too skinny. -Hey. If every Tom, Dick, and Harry from Mumbai to Dubai would want to sleep with them, -we'll get around... -1.5 million. Per night. They will have to work for... 312.5 nights. 312.5 nights... To make up for the loss. I neither have the time nor do you three have the strength to do it. If you want to trudge all your life then it's fine with me! Have you seen a real man before? Do you consider yourself to be a real man? And... What if I... violate you before everyone? Do you think I'm afraid you? I've seen many losers like you. Losers, huh? I'll deal with you later. Losers. Shankar gave you an option. I'll give you a day. Just decide and be ready. Gosh! This pant is too tight. I'll have to get a new zipper. I've left. Coming. Hello, I'm coming. Oh dear God Oh dear God Such a beautiful face! Oh dear God, such a beautiful face! So charming! So cute May God save me from them Thank you all for attending the AGM of our Bade & Medium Hotel Incorporated. This meeting has been called to discuss the financial situation of our hotels across the globe. Thank you. The plasma TV at our Vegas property... was not working yesterday. The toilet papers were not folded properly at our London hotel. Moving on... Napkins in our restaurants across the world were not washed properly. They had stains. Yesterday... at our... Love Bird discotheque... A customer asked for a draft beer, but he was served a bottle instead. So... Forgive me, but shouldn't you know the difference between draft beer and bottled beer? Right? The devil is in the detail. If you ignore the details... the devil will ruin you. You'll be dead. You have five minutes to gather your stuff and your time starts... Now. Welcome! Make yourselves at home. The door is open, start the catwalk. Come on, start the catwalk. If you are not coming, I'll wait. I have all the time in the world. We can run away. -Run away? -Where? Anywhere. We'll change our identities. They'll find us, anyway. It's India. It's a big country. Let me enlighten you. This country is teeming with over a billion people. You are right. Everyone together will look for us. We should inform the police. What will we tell the police? That we have left the fashion world and now we're working as extortionists. That will put us in deep, deep trouble. So we put your plan A in motion and extort money through fashion shows. What's the guarantee that people will offer us jobs? That... is my problem. This six-shooter here will do the talking. And once it starts talking, everybody will run for their lives. Shankar, tell me. Tell me. Come on. A new fashion show? What for? Do you think she'll come back with our diamonds? What's your plan? All right. Nobody goes to fashion shows wearing diamonds. Not even rich guys. All right. Go to a designer. Threaten to cut his finger. Fingers. Just poke it in. Who are you? Why are you beating him? Don't worry. Ladies and gentlemen, please sit down. Everyone, come on. I decided to swing by. Hello, darling! Keep the machine running. Don't stop the machine. What are you doing? Look, madam, I don't have time and you're wasting my time. Your feet aren't moving. Up and down the needle goes! Up and down. This is our trophy. Fifty-Fifty will be happy. Put this in a plastic bag. How could you do that to me? I didn't sew up his mouth. This guy can talk. Okay. Talk to the girls. Be nice to them. Okay! Hello? Who is it? Wendell Rodricks. Are we free on the 24th? Let me check. Yes, we are free on the 24th. Oh no! Look, ding-dong, baby, sing a song.

How could you do this? -What do you mean? -There's a girl under your table. Her name is Pavitra. Yes, sir? Nothing. That's her job. She gets paid for it. -What's your problem? -You call that a job? Licking your boots? You parade around naked before everyone. What do you call it? We don't roam around naked. Do you think people look at your clothes? Pavitra doesn't take off her clothes whenever she is working. God bless you. The clock is ticking. Bade Mia is calling from Dubai. Brother, I'm sending them to you. I'll be dead if my mom finds out.

Of course, you are Bade. In my entire life... I've always put Chhote and Medium's interests first. I've always put myself last. But this is something new... Never happened before. You see... No one has ever dared to steal diamonds from me. Forget the thought of selling them back to me. Who do you think you are? Do you think I'm an idiot? Why don't you ask Medium what he thinks of you? Why are you scared of that old man, Chhote Mia? You are smart and intelligent. I'm not scared of anyone. What does Abdul Fifty-Fifty think of himself? Compared to him... You look extremely small. My beloved Small, you say. My lover When will she reach here? So... What do you know that I don't? Well... I know... that you know... everything. All I know... Thirty antique, 18th century diamonds. We were supposed to get that. We didn't get it. The other hundred diamonds were stolen. My henchman Chhotu Ramu was robbed. Are you talking about these? Right. -Who do you think stole them? -Medium. -Chhote. -Whenever it rains Quite Possible. But he doesn't think he's junior to you. What does he call himself then? Very, very... Big. Very, very... Big? I think you have... a style of your own. Right. First, get rid of Chhote. You should get rid of Medium first. Then? And then... I'll show... you everything. I'll die. Oh my beloved Tea, ma'am. Where would you like it? I'll always love you I won't live without you My beloved I'll die without you I'll always love you I'll won't live without you Oh my beloved My beloved I won't live without you I'll always love you I'll die without you My love My love The tea is good, isn't it? I've realized it now. You've grown wings. Is it? Don't forget. You still work for us. But from where I'm sitting... it seems like... you're working for me. I guess, in Antwerp, you would get 1.5 million. But here, you'll get it for 1 million. Okay, only one million dollar. I'm assuming you have more diamonds. Five? Six? Ten? Twenty? Forty? -Fifty? -No, a hundred. -A million dollars. -A million dollars! There are only two people in this city who can give you a million dollars for stolen diamonds. And trust me, you wouldn't want to deal with them! Well, the diamonds belong to them. Fine. All right. Remember, we've never met. You may go now. What's the matter? How much did he offer? How much is that? Not much, around 50 million rupees. That's all? Will he buy them? No, he is not willing. I guess, we have only one way! Plan C. It's humongous. Let's see. Hello, Medium. Yes, Bade. Has... Fifty-Fifty delivered the diamonds? Huh? No, not yet. Have you heard anything about the diamonds? No, nothing yet. Okay, Bade. Mr. Medium... Your time is up. Hello, Fifty-Fifty, Anu here. Hello, Medium, Fifty-Fifty will be here on Saturday night. Hello, Bade, they will be in the hall downstairs. They are ready to settle for one million dollars. The cash is ready. Come here soon. Chhote and Medium are amassing a fortune. You should do the same. You keep your promise and I'll keep mine. -Boom! -Boom! Boom Shankar, everybody. Oh no! Hello, Dubai! Oh my God. Let's see what we have here. Put it down. Welcome. Medium... So, you want to be the boss? Yes, I want to be the boss. Bade, you're finished now! Chhote, who do you think you are? No Bade, Medium or Chhote. Everyone's equal today. My head is spinning just by watching them move. -Come on, quick. -Get in quick. Cheers to 10 million dollars! -Captain! -Yes, ma'am. As you command, ma'am. Boom Shankar! My beloved Bharati! Whatnot, get me tea and a smoke. Quick. Hello. Who is it? Alice! Have you sent the girls their pocket money? And what's with Champa and Chameli? I want the best quality. Don't send me girls with mustaches! I'll send them back! Understood? -Hello, how are you, Whatnot? -I'm fine, ma'am. Sheila. For you. Sheila Bardez was from a small village in Goa. She now lives on a private island after her retirement. With a plenty of cash. She doesn't know how to spend that much cash! -How is Bharati, Whatnot? -She's fine, ma'am. Anu Gaekwad was from Santa Cruz, Mumbai. She now lives on a private island with two more gorgeous models. This island is too big for the three of us. Rina, this is for you. Did my mother call? Rina Kaif. She has forgotten her past. She's marooned on an island with two old women who pesters her all day.
