Ex-situ conservation is the process of protecting an endangered species by removing part of the population from the habitat and placing it in a new location. I'm 25, and you're 27... Clap now! 29! 28 means you clap, then 29, 30! And back from the top! Ji... So I heard you lost your appetite. What's wrong? Tired of the same old food? You don't like chicken anymore? Ok, I know. I know the feeling. You felt sorry for the hen, didn't you? You know what Pak Maman told me? One day, Vera didn't want to eat live hens. Vera is a tiger cub. Vera told me, I feel sorry for the hens. They must be in such pain when I bite into their soft flesh. I will never eat those hens again. Then Pak Maman called the hen and asked... Hey, Chicken! Tell me the truth, are you scared? The chicken did not answer. It just kept clucking. So Pak Maman turned to Vera, the kind-hearted tiger cub. It's alright, Vera! The chicken has no idea what is happening to her, because all the hens you have eaten before, never lived to tell their mates, how painful it is to be eaten by a tiger. Pak Maman! Puji doesn't want to eat! She wants a bath! Endemic, in a broad sense can mean "belonging" in a particular geography, group, field, area, or environment; Native to an area or scope. Did you know the giraffe has an important role in world history? How so, Oom Dave? The first time a giraffe was brought to Europe, in the early 15th century, it's no coincidence that Europe soon became a mighty imperial power! But when Admiral Zheng He brought a giraffe to China during the same period, and the animal was brought to the Emperor, it was quite a sight - an image of power! The palace officials feared that Zheng He would have too much influence on the Emperor. So they advised the Emperor to never allow Zheng He to go on another expedition. China ceased to be a major power ever since. You mean giraffes are banned in China? Well, that was 5 centuries ago. China is a "modern" country now. They have zoos and even circuses. So Oom Dave, besides giraffes, what else did Zheng He bring? The word "jerapah" comes from the Arabic word "zarafah", which means something that moves very fast. May I borrow two walking sticks? Thank you. When a giraffe walks, the left front and hind legs move together, followed by the right front and hind leg. Which leg moves first, the left front or the hind leg? I wouldn't ever know the answer. She does as she pleases The neck of a giraffe can be 1.5 meters long, which is about your height ma'am, what is your name? Jehan Subiantoro. The giraffe's neck, which is about the height of Nenek Jehan here, will move back and forth to help the giraffe balance its body as it runs. A giraffe can run up to 56 kilometres an hour. A giraffe can run from that end of the cage to this end, in only 10 seconds! That's 150 meters! DON'T TOUCH THE ANIMALS So, there are three types of creatures that live in the zoo. The first type are the visitors, who come here to watch something. And there are some who come to be watched themselves. The second type are the animals being watched. Sometimes they know they are being watched, sometimes they don't. Then there are some who don't want to be watched and choose to hide, so they can do the watching. Most of this second type live in groups, although there are some who live alone. The giraffe is the most elegant animal in the world. In various customs and traditions, a long neck and legs are seen as beautiful. But don't assume that the giraffe is a fragile creature. It can kill a lion with a single kick of its hind leg. The giraffe usually lives in herds. But not in Ragunan. The giraffe here is alone, the one and only giraffe in Jakarta. Jera is her name. I've always wanted to touch Jera's stomach. When I was little, I thought I couldn't because I wasn't tall enough. But even now I still can't, the closest I can get to her is still 3 meters away. So, back to the types of creatures in the zoo. The third type are the people who actually live in the zoo. And they can be divided into three groups. The first group are the ones who work here during the day. The second group are the ones who have no place to live, and have made the zoo their shelter. Sometimes going home for a while, but more often coming back to live in the zoo for days, to spend more time with their snakes. Within this group there are plenty who come and go. Sometimes they come back, sometimes they leave and never return. And the last group are the people who feel that there is no other place like the zoo, no other place that makes them feel alive. People who are here every day. Day and night. Twenty-four hours a day. Seven days a week. 365 days a year. Dania! Dania! Dania! Dania! Nia, do you want to come out here? Nia, do you feel like coming out here, darling? If you're going to step out here, please be careful. - Oh, you want more food? - Give her more! Here you go. Lana, shh! Bring the boom closer to her ear! You can see the Asian elephant's ear is smaller than the African elephant's. The result of 7.6 million years of evolution. Step forward a bit. They have evolved in very different habitats and climates. Pak Maman, did you know? They say that at night Jera climbs over her fence, and strolls around the zoo all alone. - Of course I do. - Have you seen it? No, not yet. Wait, so you know, but you've never actually seen it? - Did Yaspi tell you about this? - No. - Who then? - Oom Dave! When are you going out again? The giraffe is the most elegant animal in the world. ...In the world... in the world... In various customs and traditions, a long neck and legs are seen as beautiful. But don't assume that the giraffe is a fragile creature. It can kill a lion with a single kick of its hind leg. The giraffe prefers to live in herds. But not in Ragunan. The giraffe here is alone, the one and only giraffe in Jakarta. Jera is her name. The animal you're about to touch is a baby elephant from Sumatra. Elephants are the biggest land mammals in the world. They have a long nose, called a trunk. They use their trunk to get food and drink, and as a hand. They have a wide ear, ...a wide ear... and two small eyes. This is their mouth, go ahead, try to touch it. They have no incisors, because they are herbivores. I don't know how to say this. What's wrong, Pak Bambang? Here's the thing, Dave, Lana... I know we all love the zoo and care about the zoo. Am I right? But well, how shall I say this... The officials are saying, that people who are not "formally" zoo employees are no longer allowed to live inside the zoo. So a red light comes out from his mouth, and goes back into his ear. That's what I saw, Oom! Where do you think he came from? He just appeared out of nowhere! Well, he's called a magician! He makes things disappear, then makes them reappear! He's been here these past two days, but tomorrow he'll disappear again. He won't really disappear, he probably just... leaves. What's the difference? When one disappears, you need to search, if you want them to return. But when one leaves, he may come back on his own. - How much? - Three thousand rupiah. You mean for an hour? No, just for one round. - Just for a round? - Well, that's the usual rate. - Can I get that for an hour? - No, I can't do that. OK fine, fifty thousand for an hour. Hey, a pack of Dji Sam Soe, throw it up here! What about the money? Just throw them to me, will you. I'll throw the money to you. Wouldn't the money fly away? So just throw me the cigarettes first, I'll tie the money to the pack, and you can throw the cigarettes back with the change! Mister! Your hand, please. Turn right, please. Go straight, please. Reintroduction is the deliberate release of species into the wild, from captivity or relocation from other areas where the species survives. Please don't touch! The bottle in my hand is filled with a potion of instant youth. It will bring back your youth, keep you healthy! Look at me. Do you believe I fought in the Diponegoro War? I am over 200 years old. In addition to youthfulness, this potion cures many diseases, the flu, headaches, tuberculosis, even cancer! From fungus, ringworm, scabs to stab wounds. - Excuse me! - Yes, Sir. I asked for some water just now. We only sell tea. OK fine, just give me an empty glass. Here you go, Sir! Hey, one pack of Dji Sam Soe! A pack of Dji Sam Soe! Throw it over here! - What about the money? - Just throw it over first. - I'll throw the money to you. - Wouldn't the money fly away? So just throw the cigarettes over first, I'll tie the money to the pack, and you can throw the cigarettes back with the change! Say stop whenever you want. Take a card, don't show it to me. Now put it back in. Is this the card? No? No. Not this one? What about this one? When he speaks, others listen. When he laughs, they all laugh with him! Rita! Truth or dare? It's got to be truth, right Rita? Oh come now, Rita, don't be sad! When you're sad, I'm sad. And when I'm sad, everyone in this room is sad! So, don't be, ok Rita? Maybe the cowboy and the Indian girl have some ideas? Can you console this lonely angel. Pathetic, pathetic, pathetic! That's it? A floating tissue, burnt by fire and turning into a flower! Or a mouse! Predictable! Let me tell you something, that is so... predictable! And predictable is the saddest thing! If I were you, I'd do something more philosophical, metaphorical, more beautiful! Such as pulling out some money from Rita's pussy here... Could you do something like that, Cowboy? You can, can't you? Yes, Indian girl, what is it? Giraffes very rarely want to sit, unlike lions or other mammals. They even sleep and give birth standing up. Giraffes are never humble, they are prideful! I also know they rarely bow. So then, how do they drink? Like a camel, they can survive quite a long time without water. And the giraffe is a bit too lazy to bow down. Because then giraffes would have to bend their front legs like this. Unlike humans, the giraffe's front legs are longer than their hind legs. Allow me to demonstrate. Imagine my hands are giraffe's hind legs, and my legs are giraffe's front legs. From this awkward position, the giraffe moves its neck and head down to drink the water from a stream. It looks odd, but in this position the giraffe is less likely to be attacked by predators. Catch it! Not behind your hair, it doesn't work. As I said, I talked to my friends from TV and they are very interested, I told them about all your skills, but just now, they called to say they're facing some technical challenges. You know how TV people are, busy. But don't worry, they will reschedule the meeting. I've just spoken to Miss Zania, and we'd be honoured if you could join us and entertain the guests here at Planet Spa. This room is big enough, right? You could perform tricks from table to table. Lots of influential people are members here, you know. You never know, bigger opportunities could come anytime. Right, Lana? Don't tilt your head. Keep it straight. Is it stuck? Now is it stuck? Now squeeze yourself into the slot here. As much as you can. Don't tilt your head, keep it straight. Good evening, Sir. Welcome to Planet Spa! That one there, her specialty is body massage. The one next to her, has a skilful mouth, I hear. So each of our girls has her own special skill. This is your first time here, right? Just try any one of them, I guarantee you won't regret it! Please. I'm going to get into this crate. You nail it shut. With a nail on each corner. Then you set it on fire. Then pull the crate up and leave it hanging. You leave it hanging until it all burns down. Okay? "Translocation" in wildlife conservation means capture, transportation and release of species, from one location to another. Trust me. My friend lost his dog two or three years ago. On his girlfriend's birthday, the dog came back! He found his way back. My friend thought to himself, the dog actually looks healthier! Don't worry, I'll tell Zania to help you out. OK, listen up! Puput, you move over here. Jojo, you move with Nesa. Sari! Sari, you move over here! Lana! You can be over here with Sari, and this is what you'll wear tomorrow Ok girls, hurry, lights out, go to sleep! And one, two! Three, four! Five, six! Seven, eight! One, two! Three, four! Five, six! Seven, eight! Don't be shy, if you don't understand, ask questions! I'll leave her to you, ok? Use your fingers, palms, arms, everything. Use your tongue, if necessary. Do make sure your tongue is strong and long enough! Like a giraffe's tongue? What? It's ok, just say it! Well, giraffes have very long tongues. They can even use it to clean their ears. Let's turn you over! Give me hand here. Hold his back. Don't worry, if this was a real man, he'd flip over in a second. At this point, the guest will ask: Why not brush the whole thing? This is a trick! To get the guest even more excited. You try it, darling! Don't be too careful! Brush against it, excite him. Just don't get him too excited or he'll get fresh with you. You know how you can tell he's getting too excited? From his cock. When it looks like this! Time for the wrap, keep it from flying away! After he is wrapped, ask him whether he wants cold, hot or warm water for his bath. Wait 25 minutes so he can sleep and you can rest. If he wants to talk, it's up to you. You can talk dirty or do sad stories, depending on the guest. Most of them like to hear you talk dirty while they are all wrapped up and naked like this. But some will enjoy your sob stories, like cheating husbands, or not being able to afford your kid's tuition. They like the idea that this girl needs money, so they feel less guilty paying you for sex, they'll tell themselves, "Oh well, it is also charity." Never pee in the guest's room! They'll ask you, Why can't you just go here? Never do it unless you know they will pay for it. And it's also a chance to go outside and get some fresh air or giggles with the girls. So you can be relaxed as well. Don't forget! Seeing a woman pee, gives them pleasure, too. You have to set the pace. Don't get them excited too fast. If they get too excited, you won't get anywhere. Remember, you should try to keep them here for three sessions! That's how you get your bonus from the company. Ladies and gentlemen, go ahead, take a picture, touch and carry him, too! Please, as you wish, for your souvenir! Don't be shy, don't be afraid! Such a good snake. Take a picture, touch him, kiss him! Please, as you wish, for a souvenir! Only in Ragunan Zoo, nowhere else can you take pictures with a live python! Such a nice snake, tame and willing to befriend human beings! Number 33. How's the pressure? Softer, please. Gentler, please. How about this? Softer, it's still too hard. Like this? I brought you a tiger costume. Put it on! It's not a tiger, it's a leopard. Just change here! But please don't look. Did you know that in Ancient Greece and Rome, the giraffe was believed to be part camel and part leopard? Because its skin texture is similar to the leopard's. That's why its Latin name is Giraffa camelopardalis. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like a ride, before buying your tickets, please pay attention to the boats' capacity. One boat fits two adults and one child, or two children and one adult. Come, take a ride in the boat with your children or your loved one! Come on, give it a go. We're at your service. Do you come here often, Sir? Hmm, rarely. Who usually handles you? Nobody in particular. No one in particular at all... - Do I take everything off? - Yes, Sir! Ok, let's lie down on your stomach... I'm afraid we're out of time, Sir. Would you like to add one more session or finish up now? Maybe one more session. One more session, please. Do you want more massage? Or should I just finish you off? Hmm... No, that's alright. But I'm afraid we can't cancel the third session, Sir. That's fine... Maybe we can... So everyone is saying my new girl is hot, what do you think?
