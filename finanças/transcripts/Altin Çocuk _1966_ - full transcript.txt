GOLDEN BOY - Where are you going? - Is it urgent? Do you think I want... ...to spoil such a night and leave? - So why are you leaving? - Business... ...call of duty. I'll be back. Just business, business... Is there an end? When will we make love? Murderer! You killed my golden boy... ...but now I'll kill you. The golden boy is not that easy to kill darling. And who's that? Everything has an imitation. And he is mine. I understand he went under plastic surgeries for five months and a half in order to look like me. So you know him? He used to have lots of aliases in our circles, But we knew him as "the Wolf". He was one of our enemies' best spies. He wanted to look like me... ...in order to steal this file. But looking like me didn't prove to his advantage. - But he managed to trick me... - You shouldn't have been tricked. Even if we looked alike, his lips wouldn't be as sweet as mine. You're right darling. Now I can see the difference. Let's try again just to make sure. Hello... Chief, Golden Boy here. Just letting you know... ...I sent that spy to hell, a minute ago. - Perfect, congratulations. - Thanks, chief. But how about getting your congratulations in cash which I can spend? Don't worry, I'll personally take care of... ...a salary rise for you. I'd also like to ask for another thing... You know, during the last five years... ...I haven't taken all my leaves. Whatever you say. We'll send you to London. Don't worry about trip... ...and stay costs, they're on the house. You should be called Golden Heart, my chief. A Golden Boy is enough for the Organization... ...we don't need a Goldheart. We're no goldminers... Intelligence is our business. I'll send over the plane tickets... Enjoy your holiday. Attention please. Passengers traveling with Pan-American Lines... ...Flight Number 65, destination Athens, ...Rome, Paris, London and New York... ...are kindly requested to board the plane. While Golden Boy... Was spending his holiday in London... ...this was happening in Istanbul... Who are you? You are wounded. It's about the security of Turkey. - I must make a phone call right now. - There's no telephone here. Pity... Get me a pen and a piece of paper then... Dial this number and tell them... ...what I wrote here. Don't forget, ...it's about the security of the country. From Turkish National Intelligence Service... ...to British Secret Intelligence Service, stop. Yes. Golden Boy requested... ...to return to duty, stop. This way, gentlemen... He was one of our best and bravest... ...colleagues. And she was the tenant of the flat... ...where our friend S-99 was found dead. She was found shot, 40- 50 metres... ...away from her house. S-99 obviously went there to ask for help. That's why S-99's message didn't get into our hands... - See now why we called you back? - I'm already used to it. For the past 4 years I haven't been able... ...to have a full holiday. I guess you remember Marcus from Beirut... He was an agent working for both sides. Before he got killed, he mentioned to one of us... Something about the strike that would hit... ...the Turkish Nuclear Facility. Is that so? Is some gang making you suspicious? Not suspicious, I'm positive. That's the proof. S-99 was investigating this case. You're on leave, so I can't assign you... ...this case. Even if you tie me up, I'll accept this case. As you know, S-99 was a good friend. I'll try, for the security of my country... and my friend's revenge. That's what I expected from you. - We got any clues? - Almost nothing. S-99 had no contacts, he worked alone. All we know is that he recently... ...stayed in Taxim, Divan Hotel. Divan Hotel... I don't think he stayed there for no reason. Find out what room he stayed in... ...and book me the one above it. This season I love the view to Bosphorus. We have made a reservation for a room... ...name is Gokhan Ates. Seventh floor, room 307. Show the gentleman to room 307. Thank you. Here you are, sir. - Anything else? - No, thanks. Thank you very much, sir. Freeze, or I'll shoot you. Give me that notebook. This isn't sight-seeing in Bosphorous, honey. If you don't step on it, I see us... ...in Karacahmet cemetery. I didn't invite you, ...nor am I on a race, ...you don't like it, you get off. I wish you were on a race... As Death wouldn't be so close behind. I see, I'll respond in the same language. We broke the wings of the deadly angels. You can slow down now, I don't care anymore. - I say, why don't you get off. - That would be an insult to you. I got an idea. Why don't we celebrate our meeting. - Let's go to my place. - And do what? Will you show me your stamp collection? - Or will we listen to music? - That's kiddies stuff. ...we're both mature enough... ...to do better things. Hello. Speaking. What? Cut the crap. You three slobs couldn't take care of him. You blockheads! I'm giving you one more chance. You better eliminate Golden Boy at once. Call London, NOW. Agent Z-19 must come to Istanbul urgently. Urgently. I'm getting tired of this Golden Boy story. We got an uninvited visitor. I'm scorched! Hold it... You're going away without paying the bill? You took a shower, we gave you a massage, so tell us who we should charge. Who sent you? Speak up, who sent you? Speak or you'll eat your tongue. I had to pay the bill again. - Your life tempo is exhausting. - I can't help it, can I? - So, where were we? - We were just getting in. We wasted precious time. Let's skip the intro then, ...and make up for the lost time. Please sir, can I help? About the water supply facility... ...I'd like to speak with Mr. Sezay, baby. From Konak Constructions. Let him in. Baby, I can offer you one of my nights. Good to see you, Golden Boy. - Your life is full of stress. - Too much of it. I met them twice, ...in less than 24 hours. I was afraid of it. They found out about your involvement too soon. Those guys are tough nuts. I love breaking tough nuts. I found this in S-99's room. Names of men and women. You think they can help? Since he was hiding them, ...they'll probably prove useful. Funda Sen, oriental bar. Start with the first name. She's either a singer or a dancer. I don't think that's hard for you. - Ms. Funda's room please? - This way, sir. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I don't think you came here just to stare at me. That alone, is worth coming, ...but tonight I'm here for another reason. And the reason is? It's about a common friend. But I can't speak with you right now. I'm going out on stage in a minute. I know how to wait. Especially for a lady like you... Excuse me for the moment. Damn, he got away! We're wasting time because of you! For smaller mistakes, I've gotten rid of my best collaborators. Golden Boy should be dead already, I told you. He tricked you again. Our agent from London has arrived, boss. He's waiting for you. Good, send him over. From now on, your mistakes will be paid with your life. Get the hell outta here now... Welcome to Istanbul, Helen. - I hope you had a nice trip. - Thank you Demetrius. ...I had a good trip but it came up suddenly. We had no choice. Our mission is urgent. Change clothes and let's take a walk... ...we can talk about things at the same time. While you enjoy the beauties of Istanbul... ...that will soon become history thanks to me, - ...I'll go get dressed. - OK. - What do you think? - It's great. Now you go. We're approaching the base. Get ready to dive. - Is that you Mr. Demetrius? - Ms. Helen came from London... ...to exterminate the dangerous enemy... ...who's preventing us from achieving our goal. You must have heard of Von Sarkof. He's been a great help in this operation. Let me show you the detonation room. Like I said on the boat, ...this is where the remote control warheads are. ...From here, we'll destroy... ...Turkey's Nuclear Facility. I can see it even now... It's going to be more fun than Hiroshima. Bad thing is our enemies... ...are getting suspicious. ...and the most dangerous of them is after us. I don't know if it's bad luck... ...or my collaborators' insufficiency. Every time, he manages to get away. From now on, you'll take care of him. That's a very important mission. I don't think you'll find it hard... ...besides, he's no stranger to you. Surprised, Golden Boy? I couldn't stand being away from you. I caught the first plane. But if I knew you'd welcome me with a gun... This wasn't for you. I'll give you a totally different welcome. I see you fell into the trap too easily. Put your hands up and turn around. Take it easy or you'll regret it. Put your hands up! You'll go out arm-in-arm with Ms. Helen. You must look like you're in love... ...which is what you are. She took such a long trip to find you. I'd rather be in a serpent's lair. You must be kept in top safety. The bird is in the cage, boss. At your orders! I was briefed by Helen. I'll personally take care of it. You're dismissed! Happy down there, Golden Boy? ...or should I call you Tin Boy? Your reputation was superficial. ...Finally, you got trapped, too. You'll find out what this means. You already hurt us too much. You'll pay for this with slow death. If you want to know what I'll do to you, ...look up to the ceiling. I can imagine your screams like a melody. Don't you see what's coming? Look again, carefully. No matter what you do... ...you can't escape that tomb. You will die slowly. Golden Boy is shuddering with fear! In a while, the blades will cut through your clothes... ...and rip through your body. You won't have just five or ten stabs, but... You'll feel the pain in countless spots... And you'll die like a rabid dog. In my glass I'm tasting the blood... ...that will drip from your body. That's all for tonight. You're just a breath away from death. This show will go on for a week... ...and at the end of it you'll go to hell. - Why are you up at this hour? - I couldn't sleep. I thought I'd have a smoke, but I got no lighter. And tonight it's so hot... It's boring in my room! No need to stay there. Together we'll have a better time. - So it's you! Why did you do it? - No time for this now... ...you must go at once. Go! You swim your way out of here. Tell me what's up first. Why did you do it? We may talk about it some other day. Now go! On one condition, you're coming with me. No way, Golden Boy. I can't, even if I wanted to. You're the only good thing in my life. You must know that I love you... ...and I will love you as long as I live. ...but don't stand there, get going! Chief, Golden Boy here. I'm back from hell... ...but it was worth it. If we act at once, ...we'll catch them in the nick of time. Their base is a mansion on the beach. Take down the address... OK. Sadrivani House, at Beylerbey. - Where will we meet? - At Uskiudar port. OK. You know what treachery means to us. You'll pay for it dearly. Let the scumbag you helped save you from our hands. I came up with an original death plan for you. You'll have the starring role in it. - Everything set? - Yes boss. Release her! This ice cradle is my own idea. Now, you'll step on the ice barefoot... ...and this nice bow, will go round your neck. I know you love ornaments. For the moment you're safe. With the heat coming out of the searchlight, ...the ice will slowly melt. ...and then you'll be hanging in the air. I don't think it'll take us too long. She's history! Take care of her. Any moment now... ...we may have uninvited guests. - What would you like? - We'll search the mansion. God forbid! There's nobody here except me. What are you looking for? The land lord and the land lady have been abroad for three months. They'll stay there for a few more months. - And who are you? - The house gardener. Who are you looking for? Some thief? We'll tell you when we find him. Come with us. Yes, but I told you, there's nobody here. We'd rather confirm with our own eyes. Too dusty. Looks like nobody lives here. I don't understand. - Maybe you confused it with another house? - Of course not. There's nobody here. - Is there some secret passage? - No. - Did you find anything? - No, sir... ...everything is abandoned and dusty. Did you find some secret communication installation? No, just electricity and telephone ones. Like you said, I probably confused houses. You were tired and stressed. Sorry uncle, we disturbed you. That's just your business. But I told you. Anyway, take care. - Still thinking about the house? - I'm positive that was the one. They played a nice game on us and fooled us too. I got an idea, but I want a reward. Reward? A hot kiss. Are you being smart with me? I'm the one who taught you these. I paid you in cash, now tell me. You go to the mansion suddenly... let's say tonight... ...and catch them off guard. And this is for your brilliant idea. - I'm leaving right now. - No... You mean WE are leaving. No, stop it. Since you accepted my idea, ...you'll accept my co-operation as well. The engine is still hot... Let's check the boot. Someone's coming... The alarm system is not playing tricks. Come out. I'll count to three. If you don't come out, I'll shoot. One... Two... - What are you doing here? - Nothing, just playing hide an' seek. What hide an' seek, cut the crap. And you drop the gun. Hands up! He's pushing up daisies. I got so scared darling. Don't be, as long as I'm with you. Pity we couldn't... ...find anything. - Good night, darling. - Good night, baby. I hope you have sweet dreams, ...after tonight's adventure. We have the morgue results. The body of a foreign woman... ...was found at Kumkapi district. As you guessed, that was Helen. She got strangled with a rope. Poor girl. But she was our enemy. No matter what, ...she helped me escape. Coincidentally, her aunt is in Istanbul. ...she wants to get her body. - Is her funeral today? - Let me ask her embassy... ...and I'll attend her funeral. Don't play it tough and tell us... ...who do you work for? What does Golden Boy know about our organization? Speak up! Bitch! Suit yourself. Any moment now... ...I'll get the news I'm waiting for. It's a matter of time. ...and when I get it, I'll blow up ...all nuclear facilities of your country. For the detonation, our base... ...in Haydarpasha is ready... Turkey will become one thousand times... ...worse than Hiroshima. But before you die, ...you'll taste the sweetness of my arms. No, let go of me! Let me go! You pig! Now you're mine. God damn it... It's urgent from the base, boss. - Who are you looking for, sir? - Ms. Helen's aunt. Sorry, madam told me that she... ...won't see anyone. She will see me. Excuse me, madam. Sorry to disturb you. My name is Nihat. I met your niece in London. I'm sorry for what happened. My condolences to you. - Darling. - You? - What are you doing here? - They got me getting in my house. ...They were waiting for me. Great Bear speaking. The wavelengths are detected. We're ready for the detonation. We're ready for detonation. Everybody in position. Roger that. Let's go now. - What about those down there? - I got no time for them now. Listen, the detonation will be done in Haydarpasha. Their base is underwater. Demetrius was expecting the signal at any moment. - Better hurry then. - And what can we do? You sit there and scream as if you're in pain. Why are you screaming? Shut up! Strange, there's nobody here. Yes, but their cars are here. - How did they leave? - Let's go! - What's up Yussuf? - Fifteen minutes ago... ...a bald guy with three others got into a boat... - ...and went away. - Hop in! Everything ready? Give me the cylinders. Look! A boat is coming. - Everything ready, Von Sarkof? - Yes, boss. It's me who'll pull down the lever of death. I must blow up their base in time... ...before Demetrius blasts us first. In Turkey, such terrorism is punished with death. You can pull down the lever, boss. Our goal was met. When I stir this wheel, ...the entire Turkey will be destroyed. It's over now! Now let me reward you... ...for your priceless assistance. Oh, I almost forgot... See you soon in the movie "Ortasark Yaniyor".
