Nak-an, hop on my back But is your leg okay? No problem Hop on You're truly amazing You got beaten so much since you were little, it doesn't fade you now My father thought his days working at the Blue House were over Hurry up I didn't finish my food, so I'm hungry as hell What am I doing here? But then the Blue House went through an expansion, and a new barber room was installed in the new wing area My father was called again to work there Since my father worked in the Blue House, Jin-gi often took care of the shop Nak-an, know what this is? No This is the twist The twist Jin-gi was dying to go to America In America, he said he wanted to meet Elvis Presley, Grace Kelly, and even Muhammad Ali What the hell are you doing? Han-mo! Han-mo Know what this is? This is the twist! When I fight the Vietcon in Vietnam, and bullets come I'll avoid them like this You've lost your mind Why don't you try it? Try it It's really fun Since he had no way to go to America, Jin-gi thought he could meet Americans in Vietnam Hey, John John, friend John, friend friend, friend John God dam you fucken son of a bitch! You fucken mother gook! Why don't you go fuck off? I don't want to speak to you! Shit you understand that, cunt you understand that? So fuck you! Don't even fucken start on me! Sit there and shut the fuck up! But ironically, the one who went to America was my father Dad rode on the US president's helicopter, and stayed at the most expensive hotel in America There were hundreds of people waiting to greet my dad at the hotel But being our president's private barber, my dad was always busy taking care of him Dad always tried to be next to the president, but sometimes he couldn't When he returned home, crowds of people waited to greet my father The neighborhood people who saw dad on TV, finally learned that my dad was the President's barber My friend in Chuncheon City wants to run for congressman He needs a nomination Can't you help him out? You know I've run my dumpling shop for 17 years Doesn't the President like dumplings? I have a promotion test next month Mr. Sung! There was this fox-fur muffler It looked so cute and warm Those were the best days for our family Jin-gi came back from Vietnam and worked with us again He didn't talk much or joke around He was a totally different person And he always wore a white glove on his left hand The customers didn't like his glove so much, but my father didn't mention it Make a head count We lost a man So that's Seoul We're close to the enemy's heart Captain, I have to take a dump Captain, I also need to take a dump Captain, please You shitting bastards Where are the rest? Shit! What are you doing there? I'm just working The so-called Marxus Disease that the North Korean spies carried is spreading across the nation The government suspects that those infected have made contact with the North Korean spies, and will be punished under the National Security Law Also, anyone who reports infected persons will be rewarded 2 million won Wow, 2 million won is worth a house! That's all bullshit! That means anyone with diarrhea is a commie They say there's no smoke without a fire The government is always right Just wait and see The Republicans should make this guy a congressman You just shut up You still in there? Don't talk to me That's what you get for eating too many beans The Marxus disease was breaking out all over the country Nobody thought anyone living by the Blue House Are you Wang Cheol-gu? Yes? Mind going out for some fresh air? Who are you? You have diarrhea, right? You have Marxus, don't you? Who infected you, you bastard? Han-mo, some men took Mr. Wang away - Why? - Because he had diarrhea Then he should go to the hospitaI I heard that those men were from the CIA - CIA? - Yeah - Why? - Because he had diarrhea Why? So what? That diarrhea disease You know, because of that Marxus disease Marxus disease? Dad My stomach hurts What's that? It's for a feces test at school No, this won't do Why do you think they're doing this? To investigate the family by looking at the kids' feces Nak-an, it means that they're testing for the Marxus disease I'll take a dump instead A real solid one Wait Men's shit is different from women's, you dummy This disease is contagious, you know So that means that somebody must have infected you Just tell me who Tell me one person, and I'll let you free If you tell us who, then we'll ask that person again Who has infected you? Then we'll know the next person, right? Then we'll ask that person again Then the next person, the next person and the next So what happens in the end? We'll find out who originally contacted the spies So don't take it too hard, and tell us just one person Then we'll just go ask that person a few questions We won't throw him in jail We'll just talk Do you understand what I'm getting at? I'm a Republican! I'm part of the Republican Party! I'm a Hyoja district resident! How could you treat the President's neighbor like this? The Doctors' Association made an announcement yesterday They said that the Marxus disease is no different from colitis Shouldn't you capture people like them first? I think we should send the Marxus patients back home It's the general sentiment now, Mr. President How could you say that as the chief of the CIA? Don't you realize that This is a great chance to overrun those who oppose us now? Director Jang! About that Doctors' Association Yes Mr. President How many members does it have? About twenty Mr. President - Twenty? - Yes Are you afraid of merely twenty people? Don't be silly The association has some doctors respected by the people So their statement could shake public opinion Rather than public opinion, I think we should worry about tackling this epidemic head on Arrest all the leaders If you have any problems, report to Director Jang Mr. President! That weak fool doesn't deserve to be in the CIA To think, he used to be my superior About that Marxus disease What happens to the ones who get arrested? - Why? - Well... because one of my neighbors was arrested - Mr. Sung - Yes, sir Just focus on your job Yes, sir Water came out of his butt! Water came out of his butt! Nak-an had diarrhea! Nah, nah, nah, boo, boo Mister Nak-an had diarrhea! Nak-an went to the market with his mom, so go play somewhere else No, he's in the bathroom I saw him in there, too You little brats! Water came out of his butt! Water came out of his butt! Kids these days are so rude Dad I had diarrhea It's not what it seems He must've eaten too many beans Why'd you eat that many beans? That's why you have diarrhea He ate all the boiled beans for the bean sauce I'll take him to the police station this instant And go see Whether he has the Marxus disease or not Let's go, boy! I still don't know Why I had diarrhea then But the important thing was that I had diarrhea anyway - Officer Kim - Oh, hello! Is the Sergeant here? He's in the room Hello Sergeant! Mr. Sung what brings you here? My son keeps having diarrhea So? Director Jang of the Secret Service is in my shop now What happened? You know how I'm the Blue House's barber Well, my son has diarrhea, so I couldn't just act like it was no big deal So you wanted to be a good Samaritan - Not exactly - Of course that's what the President's barber should do Dad What? I don't like this place Then why did you have diarrhea? Didn't you learn this at school? Our country is a democracy So innocent people are never taken away understand? Please look after him - Sure thing - Bye, Sergeant Officer Kim isn't the Sergeant here? He went out Where's Nak-an, my son? He was transferred to Jongno Police station Why? Political criminals are usually sent there Look for your son there I just asked him to look after him for a bit Why'd he go there? Hurry and sit down! Sit down you bastards! Heads down! I told you he was sent to a higher department A higher department? It means that they investigate spies But my son is only a child Is there any age limit for spies? But still he's just a child Where's Nak-an? Don't worry I'll meet Director Jang tomorrow So did you see our son or not? I didn't but... Get out! How could you come back without him? What's wrong with you? - Get out - Director Jang will... Go find our son! I told you I'll go to the Blue House tomorrow I'm the President's barber Where did you lose our son? Bring Nak-an back right now! Why are you laughing? This is torture You should be in pain I'm sorry Now, are you ready to tell the truth? You met a spy didn't you? I didn't I never met a spy Is this your first time? Yes? The first time is always hard But you'll get used to it soon, so be patient - Okay - Anyway what's a kid like you doing here? Because I had diarrhea That's too bad Now I'll start reading 'I was infected with Marxus by my father' - Correct? - Pardon? - No? - No Okay here it goes I don't know why, but the electricity was ticklish Does it hurt? It's endurable right? Yes But my mouth smells fishy It normally does I'll raise it just a little bit since you're a kid Thank you, sir I'll read it again 'I was infected with Marxus by my father' Correct? What? No The shock treatment wasn't that hard to stand But other people couldn't stand it, and eventually signed the deposition - Director Jang - What? My wife brought this ginseng from her hometown So what? You know about my son He was transferred to the spy investigation department, but I can't find him anywhere His name is Sung Nak-an Nak-an Could you help me find him, Director Jang? Or could you let me talk to the President? Are you trying to bribe me in the situation we're all in? The country is in a crisis A crisis! Do you want to die by me? How dare you speak of the President that way? It's working Fantastic! What the hell are you doing? Everything is clear! Sir, everything is clear! This is why we can't get any results! Raise it all the way up! I didn't lie to the end Because my father never had diarrhea I will now make an announcement After the CIA conducted a 10-month long investigation, we've finally succeeded in rounding up all the members of the 'Hyoja Poker Spy Ring' So even when the men who signed the deposition became famous, I was being tortured in silence Their members surprisingly included doctors and professors, and it was discovered that some of them had met the armed North Korean spies last summer Up to 20 of the spies were from Hyoja district He said there were 20 spies in the Hyoja district, but in fact there were only three, including me Everyone from the 'Hyoja Poker Spy Ring' were sentenced to death, and executed in three days Drink it How's this going to help things? Our son Good afternoon Oh hi Young-jong Did Nak-an come back? Nak-an told me to hold this for him Good-bye Mr. Sung the President wants you to come have a drink Good work Congratulations on your never-ending term - Cheers! - Cheers! Mr. Park, I heard your electric bill was high this month What are you getting at? I heard that there's a person, who's eating up a lot of electricity in the CIA building Yes, lately I've been investigating someone, but he's very persistent So what are you investigating? Mr. President I heard it's because of diarrhea Isn't that Marxus case finished? Yes, of course Anyway, I heard he's extremely young But regardless how could you torture a little boy? Director Jang Do you even know how hard my job is? Is putting electricity into a boy a hard job? Director Jang! That's enough! Why do you two always argue with each other? - I'm sorry, Mr. President - I'm sorry, Mr. President Finish the Marxus case quickly Yes, Mr. President Now what's wrong with you? I'm sorry Mr. President I was thinking of my son Why? Well, just that my son is somewhere far away You're too sensitive That's nothing to worry about Children being outside of the home is good for their upbringing When I went to a teacher's school, I grew up outside of my home After I graduated I taught in a secluded village, and then I went to Manchuria On my way to Manchuria's vast land, I had a lot of dreams I wanted to make history and become a big hero! That night, nobody knows why Director Jang brought it up Maybe it was because of dad's ginseng Or maybe because he just hated Mr. Park Regardless, I was allowed to go back home a few days later Is anybody there? Mom Dad Is that you boy? Mom... Dad... Mom Dad Mom Dad Mom Dad - Dad - Nak-an! Mom! Nak-an! It wasn't until I arrived home that I realized my body was different Oh goodness What's wrong with you? Stand up Oh no Oh no Oh no Where... Where... Where have you been Nak-an? What happened to our son? Oh goodness Oh... What am I going to do? Nak-an... Nak-an... What's going on? What happened to you? You sons of bitches! How dare you do this to my son! You sons of bitches, how could you do this to him? You sons of bitches! Don't you know who I am? I'm the President's barber! I'm the President's barber You sons of bitches! I won't let you get away with this! Determined to cure my legs, my father took me to all the famous herb doctors around the country Nak-an are you cold? No Dad... do you think there really is an herb doctor here? Of course You heard what they said back there This doctor's acupuncture can cure people and even ghosts Then why does he live in the mountains? People who are enlightened usually hide in the mountains Since he can even defeat ghosts, your legs will be a piece of cake Let's sit here for a second Here we go Dad, let's just go back home We came all the way here so why go back? Dad, your legs will freeze up I'm okay Hold this for me Dad's okay I'm okay How is he? Sir, you've said nothing for over an hour Silence I'll cure his body But his spirit Sir I don't understand I'll cure his body But his spirit I'm sorry but could you please repeat that? But his spirit should be cured by you! Your son was born with a strange fate In other words, his name is strange He's supposed to live in comfort by his name He's in this pain because the serpent across the river became a dragon So your son is paying for it What do you mean by that? When a dragon dies in a few years, it will ride a chrysanthemum bus at the funeral After you poke out its eye, boil it with chrysanthemum and feed it to your son Be silent and take off his clothes for the acupuncture Dad, where'd that old doctor go? I don't know He seems like a mountain spirit He's no doctor at all Poke out the dragon's eye? He's an old psycho Nak-an this is the sea Wide isn't it?
