SRIVALLI Do that experiment on me, sir. You need to sit stark naked. Yes, sir. You'll be surrounded with people. Yes, sir. You shouldn't even have the feeling that you are naked with people around you. Yes, sir. There wouldn't be any crossing the lines between us. I know. I too thought like you that our friendship that grew with us since childhood would blossom into love and result into marriage. But my priorities have been changed after the death of my father. I couldn't attain your love. That's alright. But I wanted to live only for your happiness. I want to live for a long time. Or I'd at least die and live in your heart forever. Do you want me or Kaise? Kaise. Do you want your life or Kaise? No matter how many times you'd ask me, I'll tell the same answer. Kaise, please don't die. Live for me. I'll be reborn for you. Give me your word. Sanskrit Sloka: Runanubhanda Rupena Pashu Patni Suta Aalaya It was written in the Shastras that every relations in this birth are the result of previous birth bondage. [cicadas critter] [indistinct woman humming] [woman humming] Male voice: Laila... [woman humming] [gate creaks]Male voice: Laila... [thunder rumbles] Male voice: Laila... [knocking on door] Coming... Hey, who are you? Why have you come at night? There's no one at home. Go back. Hey, why are you coming inside? Why are you closing the door? Don't come close. Why are you touching me? [panting] Why are you touching over there? No... You know I'm a virgin. Male voice: You have said the same thing yesterday and day before as well. Male voice: You're facing the same danger since 10 days. Male voice: Why do you still feel it as new, Laila? Woman: I'm Valli, not Laila. Male voice: Try to remember, Laila. Try to remember it once, [bangles clinking] Woman: I remember it now, Majnu. I'm Laila. "Oh my love..." "Oh my beloved..." "Oh my love..." "Oh my beloved..." "My breath turned into" "vapour" "Oh my love..." "Oh my beloved..." "Oh my love..." "Oh my beloved..." "This body has been like a desert" "Do something about it" "It's a strange wonder" "Embrace me" "The confluence of two hearts" "has begun today" "And this Laila belongs to you" "Savour me" [pants] Oh my God! What is the hell is happening to me? He name is Sri Valli. Her father Ramachandra is a popular scientist as well as a philanthropist. When Sri Valli was 10 years old, her mother Rajya Lakshmi gave birth to another child and passed away. [baby crying] "Oh dear baby..." "Oh dear baby..." "Oh dear baby..." "Oh dear baby..." "Don't cry, oh dear... Don't cry, oh dear..." "Because your mother isn't beside you" "Don't be scared... Don't be scared..." "I'm there for you" "Oh dear baby..." "Oh dear baby..." "Oh dear baby..." "Oh dear baby..." Background: "Hail Lord Shiva..." Dear Valli, do you know who has tied the Rudraksha seed around your neck? Uhuh... I don't know, dad. When you were born, your mother and I took you to Sri Manjunatha Temple, Dharmasthala. Seer Veerendra Heggade over there tied you this the Rudraksha seed around your neck and told us that it would bring good luck to the wearer and not remove it anytime. It's alright, dad. It would bring luck to my brother. Don't you need it? Kittu would give it to me in the time when I need it, dad. -Last one, okay? -Hi Valli. Hi Gowtham. Good morning, uncle. Hey, good morning. Come in. Hey Kittu... What will you eat, idly or vada? -Idly, uncle. -Hmm... Good. Here... TV news: In the annual day function of Don Bosco school, they have performed Laila-Majnu play. When the character of character of Majnu dies as the per story, the girl who was playing Laila character yelled, "Hey Gowthan, get up," and woke him up. And Gowtham woke up saying I didn't die. Gowtham... Get up, Gowtham... Gowtham... Valli, this is just drama. I shouldn't get up. And with this, the drama made the audience laugh instead of making them emotional. [laughs] [whimpers] Daddy, I won't go to school. Everyone would tease me. Why would you take it that way? You made a lot of people laugh heartfully. They'd keep remembering this instance for the rest of their lives. Let them laugh. Come on, cheer up. Cheer up... Cheer up... That's the way. Hey Gowtham, you too performed very well. Here, take this. -I don't want it, uncle. -It's like a gift. I don't want it, uncle. What do you want then? I wish I had a father like you, uncle. -Here, take the Sapodilla. -Thank you. Gowtham, do you believe in previous births? Why do you ask? When I played Laila's character yesterday, I felt that I was Laila in my previous birth. Then, I was Majnu. Hey crazy girl, do you think that this seed would germinate? If it germinates, would it survive? If it survives, who would water it daily? Who'd build a fence around it to protect it from being grazed by goats and sheep? Why do you make your hands muddy, dear? Wash your hands. This seed would germinate and would bear fruits. And those fruits will be eaten by people. I have faith in this. "The friendship showered like raindrops" "and flowed like a stream" "Friendship sprouted and grew up like a plant" "It turned into forest and flowered" "The funny moments turned into graceful smiles" "And becoming spring season for us" "Giving pleasure to the hearts" [phone ringing] -Hey Gowtham -Yes, Valli. My daddy and I are leaving to America now. Come home once. Valli, come fast. We have a flight to catch at the scheduled time. Coming, dad. You will come, right? Yes. Coming. Hey Gowtham, have breakfast and go. No, mom. Valli is leaving to America now. I have to see her immediately. America. [engine starts] [music mutes voice] [music mutes voice] "Your acquaintance is very valuable" "It is preserved in the room of my heart" "The sweet friendship is unbreakable" "It will never be in ruins" "My heart gets drenched in your memories" "My heart knows your yearning" "My eyes are searching for you" [aerplane whizzes] [tyres screech] Gowtham! "Oh my love... Oh my love... When I see you," "the feelings in heart shoot up" "You are my better half" "And I'm your better half" -Greetings, Uncle. -Greetings, Gowtham. How are you? I'm good, uncle. -Hi Kittu -Hi [engine starts] Wherever you go, you can't escape. Andrea! Mwah! -What do you feel about Mangalore? -Superb, Gowtham I'm very happy to see everyone of you again, Uncle. How long are the holidays and how long would you stay here? Dad took a permanent holiday from the job. What do you mean? He has quit his job. Usually, people who move to America would get settled there. But why did quit your job in America and returned to India? This nation gave me a lot. It raised me, educated me and made me believe in myself. It gave me courage and built confidence, no matter whichever nation I went. When my country did so much for me and question myself about what I gave it in return, it would be nothing. I have to do something and show my gratitude. -Gowtham, take us to our lawyers. -Okay, uncle. Please sign the papers. Mr Ramachandra, we have created a trust of 7000 crores as per your vision. Valli and you are the trustees. Hmm... You too sign of these papers. It is your vision to provide financial aid to those educated people who can't afford to do research. Dear Valli, are you feeling bad that I have put the entire money in the trust. No, dad. In fact, I'm very very proud of you. Where are you taking me? Shut up! How long should I sit here with my eyes closed? Just stay quiet. Should everything be told to you? -Ee... -Ouch! Why are you pinching me? [tyres screech] -Can I open my eyes now? -Don't open your eyes until I tell you. Hmm... Open your eyes now. This is our daily sitting spot during our school days. It is so changed. We used to eat Sapodilla fruits sitting here. This is from the seed that I have planted, isn't it? Yes, dear. Aunt Paandu! He has built a fence around it to protect it from being grazed by cows and sheep. He watered the plant every day. The water included the tears of emotion of missing you. He is very much fond of you, dear. -Idiot! -Ouch! Why did you hit me? [music mutes voice] [music mutes voice] [music mutes voice] [music mutes voice] [waves rustling] -Dad -Hmm... Why are you here? Nothing, dear. You have to promise me about something. What is it, dad? You have to continue doing your research. You should run the trust efficiently. It is you who have to take good care of brother as well. Why are you telling me all these, dad? I don't know. From past few days, I feel I might be going to your mother's place. Promise me. Just promise me. Oh dad, you are here! Come, let's play tennis. We're getting late. How did I play today, day. I played well, weren't I? Kittu -Daddy... -You are playing very well. You should concentrate on your backhand. There is something called backhand stroke. -You have to concentrate more on that. -Watch out, dad! A lorry! [screams] [collision] Sister... Sister... [panting] Kittu. "Oh dear baby" Don't worry about your brother. It is a small concussion. He will be alright. What about my father? I'm sorry. [weeps] [pyre crackles] Dad, I'll take good care of brother without making him dearth of anything. I won't neglect the matters of the trust. I'll dedicate my entire life to the research. Trust me. It's my word of honour. Dear students, I'm Ashok Malhotra. Your professor of neuroscience. Before we take up the class, I want to show how vast and how deep is the space. They have crossed innumerable clusters of stars. Binary stars. Red giants White dwarfs. Black holes. Galaxies. We have travelled 130 crore light-years till date. We don't how big is this universe. It is beyond our expectations. Is there anything else which is as infinite and abysmal as the universe? Uhuh. There is one. And it is inside us. Heart. It is the reason for our life and survival. It shows us the universe with different sounds, tastes and odours. But we can't see that. And the reason is, it doesn't have taste, colour, sound, touch or odour. Sir, is there no way to know about the heart? There is one. In a way how ripples are created when you throw a pebble in a calm water body, similarly, every thought that comes in our heart would get released in the form of brain waves. We call them as alpha, beta, gamma, delta and theta wave signs. Along with these, there is a mother wave as well. If we are able to identify the mother wave and calculate it, we can able to look into our hearts. Did any of you ever come across a situation where you were thinking about your friends and relatives and you got a phone call from them or they have visited you at that time? In unison: Yes, sir. Do you think it is a pure coincidence? No, it is not a coincidence. When you think about them, your brain waves would reach their heart. That is the reason they would either come to you or call you over the phone. What is the use of knowing about the brain waves, sir? A very relevant question! Everybody listen to it carefully. No man is bad or addicted to a substance by birth. But he/she would change due to the effect of the situations. If we are able to identify and calculate their brain waves, we can peep into their hearts. If we are able to know the situations that have changed them, there would a chance that we can fix those situations. With this, we can find ways of treating many of the psychological disorders. We can find treatment to most of the mental disorders. People who got addicted to alcohol and drugs can be brought back to normal. Can we see a brain wave, sir? Not till now. But many of the scientists are doing a great deal of research to find such an instrument. Even I'm working on the same. With the blessing of God, I'm convinced that my attempts will bear a fruit soon. It will definitely work out. [applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [music mutes voice] [music mutes voice] [music mutes voice] [music mutes voice] Indistinct woman whispering: Where are you? Valli... Ours is bondage of the births. How can you live by leaving me? Where are you, Valli? [camera clicks] [woman screams] [phone rings] Valli... Gowtham Why are you crying? What happened? I need to talk to you immediately. Come to our usual hangout place. [wave splashes] Andrea is my classmate. She is a lesbian. She used to misbehave with me in the classroom. She used to somehow try to touch me physically. She never listened to me no matter how many times I told her. She is smart. When I told about her to the principal, she filed a reverse complaint against me. I'm a laughing stock in front of my classmates. I thought I've got rid of her but she has followed me till here. She came to my home and misbehaved. Today, she has tortured me so much. [clangs] [glass shatters] [glass shatters] Valli belongs to me. Valli belongs to me! If anyone tries to stare at Valli, I'll kill them! Hey Gowtham... When did you come? Just now. You won't be having any disturbance from Andrea anymore. Thank you so much, Gowtham. I don't know... how I can... thank you for this ever. I don't need your gratitude! Gowtham, why are you so angry? -Who are you angry with? -It's you! Angry with me? Why? You've been facing trouble since a month. You might have undergone severe torture. Why did you hide this matter? Will you hide matters even after our marriage? Gowtham. Sorry... Sorry... I think... I've crossed my line. -I'm sorry. -No... No, Gowtham. No! It's okay. Relax, Gowtham. There won't be crossing the line between us. I know. I too thought like you that our friendship that grew with us since childhood would blossom into love and result into marriage. My heart used to be completely filled with you. But after the death of my father, there's a big change in me. The promise I gave to my father and his vision are the only things in my life. And neither do I have time nor place in my heart for any other things. My priorities have changed. I hope you understand. "Though the time had broken us apart again," "my heart yearns for you" "Though you want me to leave," "my heart is refusing to leave you" "My heart has melted into tears" "It's been yearning with your memories" "I remained like a stone in the treasure" Professor Ashok Malhotra misbehaved with the female bank officers who went to his home for loan recovery. The officers filed a complaint against the professor and he was arrested. Dear students, all of you might have watched the TV and read the newspapers. Before I take up the class, I have an explanation. Similar to how clothes and jewellery should be removed during X-ray scan, the clothes should be removed in order to measure the brain wave. And you shouldn't be conscious about not having them as well. When I was in that exact situation and practising it, the female bank officers came in without knocking and saw me. They have misunderstood me and filed a police report. That's the truth. And I have not misbehaved with anyone. Now, let's go back to the class. Why is your hand trembling? What happened, sir? There was a small anomaly in the experiment and it had affected my hand. It's alright. It will become normal. -Do that experiment on us, sir. -Yes, sir. No, Gowtham. No! Sit down. There are many risks involved in it. One might get completely paralysed or go mad. It can even lead to death. But why are you taking this huge risk, sir? What is it, sir? What are you looking at? A mother in the Mangalore port. She's having a heavy load on her head and her legs were trembling out of unbearability. Her stomach was starving, eyes were in lethargy and body was sweating. But she has the anguish to send her 10-year-old kid to school. She kept working overtime and alas, died. She told her sobbing son not to cry about but to do something about hapless people like her. That kid graduated here. He did masters and attained doctorate as well. He worked as a professor for 30 years. But what did he achieve? He took a loan in the bank and had been arrested for not repaying it. Anyhow, it doesn't matter if a son lives or dies when he can't fulfil his mother's dying wish. Sir... Can I tell you something? Yes. Since what you are doing is a great experiment, if it becomes successful it would be doing great benefit to the world. But if something happens to you, who would be finishing that experiment successfully? Do you have a solution? Do that experiment on me, sir. You need to sit stark naked. Yes, sir. You'll be surrounded by people. Yes, sir. You shouldn't even have the feeling that you are naked with people around you. Yes, sir. Thank you. God bless you, my child. [machine blipping] [machine blips] [machine blipping] I miss you, mother Valli. [machine blipping] My mother's name is Valli as well. Activate integrated ground network. [machine blipping] Muscular pH, oxygen saturation and SO2 levels. [machine blipping] Galvanic skin response, radiation, work load, body temperature and pressure. [machine blipping] Valli, we are moving to second phase. If you feel any discomfort, please let me know. Okay, sir. Calm your brain throughout the experiment. Initiate stage two. [machine blipping] Sir, the body function is going red. Valli, there's turmoil in the amygdala, the memory centre. Please focus on your breathing. That's good. Sir, what is amygdala? All our painful memories before our birth would be hidden it. If it gets activated, all those memories will be remembered and causes us pain. Do we get the memories from our previous births too? Yes, if there are any previous births. Activate body-water diamagnetic repulsion. [machine blipping] [buzzing] Initiate brain wave activity. Capture Valli's brain wave activity and store in a new folder 'Valli'. [machine blipping] Initialise normalization protocol. Fantastic! Valli, we have successfully mapped your brain wave. [applause] Take it, sir. Thank you. Sir, you might have spent a lot for this brain wave experiment. So, please accept this. I can't. Please, sir. Wherever my father is, he would feel happy. So please accept this cheque. Thank you. Valli, your mom is doing well, right? My mother has passed away while giving birth to my brother, sir. Oh! I'm sorry. My brother too got severely injured when my father had met with an accident. He is in a coma. Can I see your brother once? Sure, sir. Doctor, is there any variation in the ECG? There is no variation from the last six months. Sir, can we cure my brother with the brain wave? Yes, Valli. The neuron activity is dull. I'm confident that we can increase it. Let's give it a try. Thank you, sir. Valli, I'm feeding your brother's thought wave in the anamorphic cerebrograph. [machine blipping] Now, it is going up the end cephalic wing nexus. It will bind it by preventing it from crossing the brain wave. -Gowtham-Sir. Feed Valli's brain waves. [blips] These are cerebro seismic bio sensor gloves. Manipulate your brain wave with your hands and contract it to the size of Kittu's brain wave. [blipping] Now, overlap it. [blipping] That's good! Kittu's brain wave is in your control now. You have entered into Kittu's brain. Call him. Brother. "Oh dear baby..." "Oh dear baby..." "Oh dear baby..." "Oh dear baby..." Sir, I can hear the lullaby from his memories which I have sung it during his infancy. All the things that were seen and heard since birth would get registered in brain subsconsciously. When you called him brother, he remembered the memories with that were stored in his brain. Become his brain and give instructions to his mind. I can move my fingers. His hands are moving, sir. I can move my legs. His legs are also moving, sir. Thank you. Thank you so much, sir. "Oh dear baby..." "Oh dear baby..." "Oh dear baby..." He will be fine. This is enough for the first session. We have to slowly introduce the external manipulation to cerebro cranial nerves. By the way, I'm going to the USA tomorrow. I'll return after 15 days. Then, we shall continue this. Okay, sir. Bon voyage. Sir, may I drop you at the airport? Thank you. [birds chirping] Sir, Gowtham is helping me very much. Valli, are you fond of Gowtham? Ask Gowtham about it, sir. He would answer it right. I don't just like Valli. She is my life, sir. [knocks] What is it? Idiot! Well, how are you going home? Uhuh. Huff... Take my bike. Thank you. "Oh my love..." "Oh my beloved..." "Oh my love..." "Oh my beloved..." "My breath turned into" "vapour" "Oh my love..." "Oh my beloved..." "Oh my love..." "Oh my beloved..." Shall I leave now? Majnu... [gasps] [wave splashes] Valli... Valli, why are you gloomy? Some guy is coming to me every day. He's forcing himself on me and having sex with me. I was restricting him initially. But after some time, I'm asking for more of it. My behaviour has been cruder than a hooker. I'm feeling disgusted about myself. Excuse me. Let's call the professor and know what it is. [dials] Dialer tone: The number you are calling is currently switched off. Damn! It is saying that he is out of coverage area. From the past few days, I tried many times. Same answer. The professor has conducted an experiment on you, right? This might be the side effect. Don't worry. No, I wish it was true. What is this? This is the bracelet of the guy who visits me daily. It broke last night and I found it on my bed in the morning. As per the letters on this bracelet, it infers that his name is Majnu. He's addressing me as Laila. I'm going mad Gowtham. I feel like dying. Hey... What is this mad thing that you are doing? [wave splashes] What time does he come to you daily? 12 am. I'll come to you before that time. I'll wake you up when you dream. If someone really comes, I'll kill him. [waves rustle] [ticks] [phone ringing] Majnu? Hello. Hello. [phone ringing] Majnu? Hello. Hello. Who is it? Hello. Hello. [phone ringing] Who is it? Speak, damn it! Who is it? Who is it? [mobile shatters] [thunder rumbles] [gate creaks open] [windows clatter] [creaks] [door clatters] Hello... [motorcycle whirrs] Gowtham. Gowtham! Laila... Laila... Laila... Laila... Valli... Valli... Valli, open the door. -Gowtham -What happened? Come with me, Gowtham. Let's go. What happened? -Listen to me. -Did he come? -Gowtham, just come. Please -Wait... He is inside. He'll kill you. Just come. -Please. -Wait! Listen to me. -Come, Gowtham. -Listen to me. No, just come with me. Drive... Drive... Come on, drive. We have to leave. Gowtham, just drive. [screams] Laila... Laila... Laila... Laila... Laila... Laila... Ah! What worth does this life have when I can't attain your love, Laila? Kill me with this dagger. Just kill me, Laila. Laila... Laila... "Oh Allah!" "Thank you, Allah!" "You are here" [whips] "My Laila..." [whipping] [groans] Enough. Listen, Kaise. You did a mistake by falling in love with my Laila. You did a crime! A very big crime! Whatever the punishment you have undergone till now is just a grain of soil. And the punishment you'd undergo would be as big as an Arabian desert. Do you have any last words, Kaise? My lord, The word which up on speaking would make torture into bliss and the hell into a heaven, I will speak out that word, my lord. Give me permission, my lord. Can hell become a heaven? What is it? Speak out. Laila. Finish this wretch! [whips] [groans] Kaise... [whips] Kaise... [whips] [groans] Kaise... Begum Saheeba, Do you want me or Kaise? Kaise. Do you want your life or Kaise? Kaise! Laila... Begum Saheeba, think and answer. No matter how many times you'd ask me, I'll tell the same answer. [stabs] [groans] Laila... [stabs] [groans] Laila... Laila... -Laila... -Kaise... Release him. Be it life or death, it's with you. Kaise, please don't die. Live for me. I'll be reborn for you. Give me your word. [weeps] Did I stab my Majnu? I did a terrible mistake! [sobs] [woman screams] Hey Gowtham, come... He's killing me. [yelling] Remember Andrea? Andrea? Valli... Valli... Ow! Hey! Who the hell are you? Let go of her! Ow! Valli... Valli... Valli... Valli... Valli... Gowtham... -Gowtham! -Valli... [groans] Valli... Gowtham... Valli, nothing will happen to you. Don't fear. Gowtham! Please don't hit him. Please... Please... Gowtham... Gowtham... Please let go of him. No... Gowtham! Gowtham... Valli... [thunder rumbles] [thud] [groans] Ow! Andrea... [pages rustle] [bangles clink] Valli... Valli... Valli... Valli, can you hear me? Valli... Valli... Shut up! Don't disturb me. Once more, Andrea. [cicadas critter] [thunder rumbles] [thunder rumbles] Valli... Gowtham. Valli... Gowtham... Valli... Gowtham... Gowtham... Gowtham... Gowtham, get up. Get up... Valli... Help... Sir... Sir... Please help me... Pullover... Please... Please somebody help... Please help me... Help... Sir... Sir... Please help me... Please help me... Is someone there? Please somebody help. Please help... Help... Help... Sir... Help... Sir... Sir... Please help me... The musical night was very good, wasn't it Sudha? Yes, dear. [phone rings] Hello. Help me, please Ah! Hey... Stop the car... Stop the car. [tyres screech] Hey... [gunfire] Catch them. Have some water, dear. Slowly... Oh no! It is a terrible thing. Hello. Police control room? I'm Sudha Rani, the mayor. I'm at Deralakatte. There's an incident of rape attempt on a girl here. Come immediately. Bastards! It was not them, sister. Who is it then? He is... that guy... What's your name? Valli... No... No... I'm Laila. Is it Laila? Who raped you? It was Andrea, sister. No. It was Kaise, sister. Kaise transformed into Andrea. I sought it myself. Majnu is good but a bad person. A very bad person. He thrashed Gowtham over there. -Don't worry. Please save Gowtham. I'm here with you and the police are arriving as well. [siren wailing] [glass shatters] [groans] Oh dear! Sudha... He is the one who raped me. He is the one. -Sudha... Sudha... -Ow! Sudha... Hey insane girl! How can my husband who's been blind by birth rape you? Throw her in the mental hospital! -Take her to the hospital -Take her away "Is this hallucination or a dream or a secret form" "Can this be tolerable when this keeps repeating?" "Who is the animalistic miscreant who has" "crushed the rose at a night like a demon?" The bloody flesh in her nails belongs to her. Even the injuries on her body were inflicted by her. It wasn't someone else's work. She is a virgin. [music mutes voice] "In the union with the moon" "Are the deadly screams called heaven?" "Has the dark night been engulfed by the erotic eclipse?" "Is this strange change called hell?" "In the ongoing hunt..." "I'm pleading..." "Every second is unbearable from now on" "I'm the solace" "I'm the care taker" "It's this way" They claim that no one raped me and I'm a virgin. I've seen the guy who raped me in the outside locality. He is a blind guy. What's all this? -He has hit you, hasn't he? -Valli. Can you believe what I tell you? Everything you said was true. He has thrashed me. I was tied. But I didn't see any person. I swear. [waves rustle] Gowtham, Andrea too was here that night. Is she still in Mangalore? Uhuh... No. No... She's off to a faraway place. She won't return again. [phone ringing] -Hello professor-Yes, Valli. -Sir, where are you?-I'm still in America Sir, I've trying to call you from such a long time. What happened, Valli? Sir, someone is having sex with me every day. But the doctors claim that I'm a virgin. My house is completely damaged. But they claim that no one entered. Yes, I can understand. Definitely, it is the world of a devil. -You mean ghost?-Yes. There are many things which are beyond scientific knowledge. And the ghost belongs to that category. Though science doesn't approve this, there are some things which we need to believe. We have to believe them. What should I do now, sir? I know a sorceress in Mangalore. Her name is S Maralda. She speaks to ghosts. She will show a way for those who are suffering due to them. Meet her and tell that I've sent you. You might find a solution. Ma'am. Professor Malhotra told me everything that some supernatural force is troubling you and he wants to know what and why is it doing that? Is it true? Yes, ma'am. Place both your arms on this. Wish that your troublemaker shall get into this. Now, I'm going to talk to ghosts in their language. Don't be scared. [no voice] [no voice] Who is it? She tells she is Andrea. Why did Andrea become a ghost? She tells she was murdered by Gowtham. I couldn't bear when she was harassing you. That's why I have killed her. But why is she harassing Valli when I'm the one who murdered her? A small infliction of pain to Valli would torment Gowtham. That's why she has been harassing Valli. I'll give her whatever she wants. Ask her if she would give up on me. Please. Your life... She says she wants nothing but your life. [honks] [tyres screech] Why are you serious, dear? I wanted to stay away from Andrea. But that doesn't mean that I wanted her dead. Let me explain you. -Actually... -Enough of what you did! Speak nothing. Though you have did that out of love for me, you have murdered a person. I can't digest that. From now on, I'm don't have any relation with you. Get out. -Valli? -Get out! [cicadas critter] [ticking] Valli... My sweetheart. Get up. [electricity buzzing] Can't you see me? I'm here. I'm in good mood. Have coconut water. You too would get into good mood. Having coconut water at midnight would give you good kick. Come on, drink. Ow! [shatters] [woman bellowing] [screams] Shall I drink coconut water? It would cheer up my mood. -[screams] -[woman bellowing] Where will you go? How long will you go? I'll follow you. Valli, you are here... Oh no! [woman bellowing] [screams] No... -[woman growling] -[screams in pain] Please leave me. Please... Is it painful? Leave me, Andrea. I won't leave. [woman bellows] No... Please... Leave me... No... Please... No... No... Gowtham! Gowtham, where are we? Seems like Andrea brought us to her world. Where is Andrea? I'm scared. You might hear her breath from any direction. Observe. The sound of her breath is not coming from any direction. It looks like there a way over there. Come, let's go. Yes. Gowtham, I'm scared. -[woman sniveling] -Gowtham! Gowtham! [clanging] -[woman sniveling] -Gowtham! Gowtham! [bell tolls] Gowtham... Gowtham, get up. [bell tolling] Where will you go... ...leaving me, Gowtham? Either we shall die together or live together. Will you live or shall I die? [woman sniveling] [bell tolls][woman groans] [woman yells] [woman yells] Gowtham... I can't handle my financial affairs. I'll write all my properties on your name. You shall manage them. I can't do anything without you. I can't manage. Please... Please... What shall I speak now? I, who is a mental prostitute... I, who is a mental prostitute... I, who's been deemed by the people as a bad woman... I, who's been deemed by the people as a bad woman... Take care of me by marrying me. Please take care of me by marrying me. Thank you. What more shall I tell him? What more shall I tell him? Hey Gowtham, I have turned mad. Hey Gowtham, I have turned mad. Hey Gowtham, I have turned mad. Transfer all my properties on your name, please. Transfer all my properties on your name. Transfer all my properties on your name, please. Please... Please... Please... Please... Save me, Gowtham. Save me, Gowtham. Save me, Gowtham. Save me... Save me... Save me... [Gowtham bellows] Hey Valli, I made you fall on my feet. [cicadas critter] [singing] Hey, wanna hook-up? What's the price? 200 rupees. Come on. -Sit inside.-Come... Come... Hey Gowtham, do you know who is responsible for my messed up life? He is the one... He is the one. Ramachandra. He was my classmate. He said he was in love with me and wanted to marry me. He roamed around me like a rabid dog. On the day when we are about to get married, he came to know that I was roaming with my house owner He said, "Hey street woman, I won't marry you." [pants] I cried and said, "Don't dig my past. From now on, I will see no one except you." He didn't listen to me at all. He made me a laughing stock and left. When I was 12 years old, my parents died in an accident. I didn't have money even to pay for their funeral. And I was very anguished. What did he think about how I lived since then? Who will provide me with food, clothes and a shelter to live? The owner of this house gave me all those. [sobs] And I gave him what I have, in return. Doesn't he have that common sense? Even the marriage got canceled, his angry words are still echoing in my ears. I have really become a cheap woman as he said. There is no count of how many people I have slept with. My heart is burning. Vengeance on Ram Chandra... I have begged God for a son who can help me with that. He finally heard me... Hey, Gautham... You are supposed to be his son. His fortune is actually yours. Promise me that you'll take over it. Promise me that you'll make his daughter just like me. Promise me. Forgive me, mom. I failed to achieve your dreams while you are alive. [phone rings] Yeah, Valli... I have come to a decision. -What's that? -I want to marry you. Is that OK? If you are OK with it, I am OK too. Professor sir... You are making me do such a bad thing! How can I redeem myself? Brother, I am getting married to Gautham. He's such a nice man. He'll take good care of us. Sister! Sister! Sister! Sister! Sister! If I feel that I need the Rudhraksha, Kittu will give me one, dad. Thank you, Kittu. "Sleep well..." "Sleep well..." Hey, stop! [religious chants] Stop! [religious chants continue] "Dear Lord Shiva, the Rudhraksha is your tears..." "The evil will die under your feet as you dance." "Mother Ganga jumps out of your braided hair." "Listening to your name kills all the bad deeds." "Hail the Lord Shiva." "Taking the holy words of Panchakshari will make us pure." "Man with the third eye, you can kill all the evil if you get angry." "Worshiping you will give us peace." "The entire world will fall at your feet..." "Hail Lord Shiva..." "Hail Lord Shiva..." Sir! Sir, who hit you? How are you here? Sir, are you OK? What happened, sir? Sir, what's all this? Sir... Coffee. Slowly! Sir, what happened? I started to the airport with Gautham, right? -Yeah. -He stopped the car on the way... And invited me into his house. He tortured me. He didn't even feed me. Water! He asked me to teach him how to operate the Brain Wave machine. And I did. My old age failed to take the torture. I did a mistake. Forgive me. Please don't say that, sir. The husband of this town's mayor is really blind. But he made you look at him like he's really not blind. He made you feel like you are making out with him all the time. He made you believe that you are Laila and Majnu in your last lives. He made you ask for sex again and again. He made you hate your own self. It's him who threw the bracelet on the bed. He broke everything in the house. He made you feel like the furniture is also broken. He talked to you, imitating my voice. He paid them and made people say what he wants them to say. He made you ask him to marry you and take over your property. Do you know what he said to me? Malhotra sir, you are my guru. I want to pay back to you, sir. I am going to marry Valli, sir. After my first night, you can have her for the second night. I won't let anyone touch her, after you touch her. I will kill her. My word of honor, sir. Everything that you feel like they happened. It's him who did them. [phone rings] -Hello?-I am Dr. Amala speaking... Your brother is conscious. Come to the hospital at once. -Kittu... -I won't open my eyes. Goutham will kill me if I do. -I am your sister... -Sister... Close your eyes and sleep beside me. Or else he'll kill you too. He's conscious just an hour back. He's been repeating the same since then. -Sir, what should we do? -He's scared of something. Let's take him to the lab and read his mind. OK, sir. [singing 'Jingle Bells'] Find out... Why he's afraid of Gautham. Gautham! Sir, Gautham killing my dad... -Kittu saw it. -Valli... Your brother will come out of the coma. But he'll be scared all his life. Gautham has to die... -How, sir. -The only way is for you... ...to kill Gautham. You must kill Gautham. -Sister... -Kittu! Valli, take your brother and run away. -Take police protection. -You ask her to kill me? Die! Who are you? Why are you coming in? Get out! Leave! -Valli... -Sister! A FEW MINUTES AGO You have to kill Gautham. -You must kill Gautham. -Me? -I should kill Gautham? -Don't be scared. The same way Gautham tortured you... You too should do the same. You have to control Kittu's and Gautham's mind at a time. In Kittu's point of view... You should save him by fighting and killing Gautham. By controlling Gautham's mind, you should make him walk to his death. But it's not that easy to control two minds at a time. You should have a hell lot of concentration for that. That can only be done underwater. Once you get in and start controlling both their minds... If you come out before it's done... You won't have a second shot at it. Concentrate... Hold your breath. Hey, look at him! Looks like a mad man. Be calm! Sister! Come, let's die together. Sister, be careful! Gautham isn't dead. If he died, his brain wave would have disappeared. He's scared like hell for some reason. Gautham is dead. Yes, I did it! Gautham is dead. Gautham is dead. -Brother... -Sister! You killed Gautham for me. I am no more scared. "Sleep well..." Sister! "Sleep well..." "Sleep well..." Behind every dark cloud, there is a silver lining. Every pain will be followed by happiness. Every country in this world recognized Ashok Malhotra's research. He earned a lot of respect for that.
