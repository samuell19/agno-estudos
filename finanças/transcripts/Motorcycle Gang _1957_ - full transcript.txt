(dramatic music) (engines rumbling) (jazzy music) (engines roaring) (jazzy music) (engines roaring) (jazzy music) (engines roaring) (tires screeching) (siren blaring) (engines roaring) (siren blaring) (engines roaring) (siren blaring) - Let's go! (engines roaring) Well, they've gone back to the racing forms. (engines roaring) (dramatic music) (softly moaning) - Hey, what are you trying to do, start a fire? - Oh, for a minute I thought you departed planet Earth. - Not this week. Got a date on Saturday night. - I accept, where'll we go? - What have you been smoking, salmon? (sighing) - Theresa Lindsay. Theresa? - Terry. - (chuckles) Yeah, I know what you mean. They tried to stick me with Randolph, but it's Randy to all who love and admire me. - Such first-aid my mother warned me about. - Wow, one, two, three, testing. - Hey, you play that kinda cop tag often? - No, I got carried away. (gentle jazz music) - Hey, I see you use this spot for other purposes, too. - Yeah, just a little nature study. - Well, look, I know all about the birds and the bees and characters like you. Let's go. - Take it easy, it's open season on cycle hounds. They're still looking for us. - How long do we stay here, three weeks? - I'm game, can you cook? - Oh boy, you must be the life of the party with those jokes of yours. - We can go rescue your friend now, doll. - If anyone needs saving, it's Randy. - Yeah, and I'll bet you're the one that can do it, too. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't tangle with Marilyn. She's a miger, I'm warning ya. - A what? - Oh, I forgot, you're not hip to this new lingo. Miger, mad tiger? Hey, if you girls have to fight, make it about me. - Oh, expire, clown, I promise to send flowers. - (coughs) Ah, come on. (gentle music) - I thought I knew every cycle cat in town. - Well, I'm from a foreign land. - Oh? - Chicago. - (chuckles) Well, welcome to the U.S.A. How long you staying? Where? And what's your phone number? Oh, answer in any way your please. - Well, my parents are away seeing Europe so I've been exiled to my uncle's ranch near Saratosa. - Saratosa, that's where we're holding the PMG race. Man, that's real cool cycle country. Oh, you're staying for the summer, I hope. - Until I drive my Uncle Ed nuts. He's trying to wean me off of motorcycles, onto cows or something, I guess. - How 'bout that phone number? - Oh, we communicate by smoke signals. Oh, my uncle was an Indian fighter. - (chuckles) Like Speed would say, "You're a sholl." - Huh? - Oh, a sharp doll. Off and on a wheel. - Burning rubber is my one big vice. The last guy who tried this lost an arm and a leg. - It'll be worth it. (dramatic music) - You all right? (both chuckling) Come on up. - Yeah, I'm okay. - See tomorrow's episode of "Love in the Ravine." Will the girl escape a fate worse than death? Or will she marry the drip, which is even worse? - The winner and still unsullied, Terry the Terrible! - And now, ladies and gentlemen, a word from the winner. - 'Tweren't nothing, ma. I just seen my duty and done it. - And now a word from the runner-upper. - Oh, beat it, you flop-eared nit-wit. - Come on now, a word for your public. Come on. - Okay, okay. It was a fixed fight, I took a dive. It all goes back to an unhappy childhood. I was born in a little log cab cabin in Yemishlush. My mother was away at the time. - You know, I won a trophy once, but it was for endurance. Seven years in the sixth grade. Or was it six years in the seventh grade? Well, would you like to come up and see it some time? - I can see it now, screwed into your neck, solid bone and ugly. - You, I could like. How's your old man fixed for a lawn green? - I know where you can buy a padded cell real cheap, your size, too. - If it's next door to yours, I'll take it. I'll see you down the hill, Randy. - Okay. (engines roaring) You called me out down there. How about a re-match? - Send your manager around to see me. When you're in shape. (Randy chuckles) - (sighs) My hero. - Don't worry. Undernourished, that's the trouble with me. Had only four meals today. - Say, a bunch of hot shoers hang around a joint called the Blue Moon. We're having a big meeting tonight. You're invited. - One of those organized clutches. - Pacific Motorcycle Groups. - Club charter and all that jazz? That sounds like a real squash. - Well, I don't know about that. A little official blessing goes a long way in this sport. Come on, give it whirl, 8:30. - Here's one member who will survive if she can't make it. - I don't know why, but your mother doesn't like me. - Ho-ho-ho, wait a minute! (laughs) - I know you want to see me again sometime, baby, so just give your message to any traffic cop. I'll get it. (engine fires) (groans) They got me bad. I died for love. - Come on, clown. (engines roaring) - Well, she rides like you do, like there's no tomorrow. - Here I thought I was gonna die of boredom this summer. I think I'll take in that meeting. - Yeah, some of those sky riders are pretty wild. - That's for me. (engines roaring) - Why, you gasoline-burning monster. - Ah! Oh. - Aw. (laughs) - Well, now, face it, Uncle Ed, one day these are gonna replace horses. It's gonna be a horseless world. - Yes? Well, you just try and convince a full-blooded stallion of that and see how far you get. You're all dirty, honey. - Yeah, I took a slight spill. - Yeah, I can't figure where you get this wild streak. - Hey, I'm the foreman. I'm even thinking about joining a club. - Well now, that's the best thing I've ever heard. Gonna be poetry and sewing? That kind of a club, huh? - Yeah, and also instructions in the minuets. (laughs) - Well now, isn't that great? I'll bet you've found yourself a fella. Is that the reason of this change? - A living wheel. - A wheel? Well, you just roll him by here some day and I'll take a look at him. - Boy, he handles a fuel-bender like it's a rocket 90, in and out of traffic. - Now, what kind of talk is that? (chuckles) (Terry laughs) They just don't make girls like they used to. - What's the matter, Uncle Ed? Has that changed, too? (chuckles) - Aw. - Any of you squares out here gonna part with a little lettuce? Everybody's out here scratching away rent free. How am I supposed to make my tax bill for Uncle Sam? - I'll go for a malted. - You'd go for washing dishes. With what you owe me, I could bring other wife from Hong Kong. (girl giggling) Hey Randy, did you try the fuel mixture I told you about? - No, not yet, I'm gonna try it at the trials next week. - That should give your hips some white-hot runs, man. - Yeah. (gentle music) Think she'll be around tonight? - Who? Oh, you mean the babe you overwhelmed this p.m.? You still on the pillow about her? - Ah, fantabulous, wasn't should? - Yeah, she was. Wow, get those lightning rods outta here. - Go get yourself ventilated. Put your dark glasses on. I'm having trouble with my clutch assembly. Will you check it for me? - Right here in broad daylight? - You're so funny I could split your sides laughing. - Yeah, I'll take a look at it as soon as I finish this bit. - Look who's having trouble with their clutch assembly. - I'll count three and you take your last breath. - You know, I had her there. She can't count past two. Hey, what does come after two? (engines rumbling) - No reception committee? No glad hand? (scoffs) How do you like that? Away 15 months and they don't even remember my name. It's Rogers. Nick Rogers. (dramatic music) Hello, Randy. Glad to see me? - Why not? - I'll bet. - Look Nick, I'm sorry for what happened. What do you say we forget it? - Forget it? Forget 15 months in that lousy place? - I told-- - Look, here's how I forgot it! (punch thuds) (dramatic music) - Take it easy, Nick! (punches thudding) (dramatic music) - Hey, you guys, this is my bad wall. If this store goes down, I'll sue you! (dramatic music) (glass shatters) (punches thudding) (dramatic music) (woman screaming) (dramatic music) (motorcycles crashing) (dramatic music) (punch thuds) (dramatic music) (Nick panting) - You had your chance, you muffed it. - If you're smart, you'll keep away from me. - I'm not smart, kid. - That ape! There'll be nothing but trouble now. They shouldn't have let him out. (upbeat jazzy music) (woman giggling) - Hey, watch that battering ram! You nearly got me. (glasses clinking) - Hey Birdie, why don't you join the Navy? They could use another aircraft carrier. - Hey, you're talking about the girl I love! To eat with! (Birdie laughs) - You're a riot to be with. I had more fun the night I got locked up in the morgue by mistake. The stiffs couldn't see, but they looked at me. - I'm losing too much power on the take-off. Old brick's light nearly all the time. Gotta figure a way to compensate. - You've got a one-cylinder mind. (jazzy music) - I don't want no brawling in here. Positively no blood, huh? You guys go ape and I'm gonna call the boys in blue. Get the picture? - It's in focus, the scene's made, now cut out. (jazzy music) Looking good, Marilyn. - Glad somebody thinks so. - I'm back. I told you I wasn't smart. - What are you trying to prove, anyway? - That I hate your guts for what you did to me and I'm gonna get even. - Finished your little speech yet? - For now. (jazzy music) - Looks like the joint's gonna be jumping. - You know, old Nick wants his crown back. King of the yo-yos. - I bet he tries to break up the club. - Think I'll try a 10 GB carb and a 13H choke. - Quiet. Genius at work. - Oh, hey, invent me 35 cents for a malted. - I'm desperate, I'll even dance with you. - Tell you what, I'll flip you. Loser dances with her. - I should live to be one of your pallbearers. (jazzy music) - You know, he sees red when he looks at you. - Ah, he'll simmer down. - (chuckles) Not him. You know, he oughta make a flat deal with a psychoanalyst, that's short for-- - Oh, nevermind. - Hi, Birdie. Let's talk over tomorrow's menu. (Birdie laughs) (engine rumbling) (jazzy music) - Hi. - Hi. - You look better than I remember. And I do remember. - That's not a bad opening line. - There'll be fur flying tonight. - Could be. - What'll it be, fingernails at 10 paces or hair-pulling at four? - She's more the outdoor type. Maybe and up and over to the weeds off a gas tricycle. - Yeah. About dessert, now... - Hi chick, another one. Babes spring up like bongo players at the beach, these cycle cats. - Oh? - Meet Cyrus Q for Quincy Wong. Closest he's ever been to the Orient is San Francisco. - Boston boy. What'll it be for cash? - Hamburger. Rare and no onions. - One pony, still living, no tears. - Oh, that's not all. He plays rock and roll on a Chinese one-string harp. (Randy chuckles) - Out slumming? - Well, I didn't think so until I saw you. - Introduce me. - Miss Caviar of 1957, meet the head of Nick Rogers Inc. The Inc. is for incorrigible. - I'll see you later. And often. - Not a dull moment around here, I'd buy that. Hi, Mohammed. Saw you dancing with your mountain. (Randy laughs) - You know, you must feed on cattiness. (Terry laughs) Hey, why didn't you bring your girlfriend? You know, the one-- The one with the (chuckles) big ears. - Why don't you go and knock a hole in that wall with your head? We need some ventilation. - Well, I can take a hint. Even if it's a subtle one. - We've got some new times to talk over together. - Well, why didn't you say so? (jazzy music) - Hello, Nick. I heard you were back. - Yeah, Randy put in a good word with the parole board for me. You're in civvies, Lieutenant. How come? Night off? - I'm on special duty now, Nick, working with PMG club. - Oh, you're the one that made a Sunday school class out of this joint, huh? Rules, regulations, charters. (scoffs) - The kids asked for it. You behave yourself, maybe they'll let you join. - That'll be the day. (jazzy music) - Oh, hi, Joe. - Hey. - Uh, Terry Lindsay, Lieutenant Watson. - Hi. - Hi. Can I see you a minute? - Yeah. Make it a short one. - Excuse us, will you? - Yeah. (jazzy music) - I heard about you and Nick mixing it up last night. - Ah, things get around. - Don't let him get to you, Randy, he's rotten. - That's not gonna be easy. The more I back away, the more he'll crowd me. - I know. But even a street fight's a misdemeanor. You understand? - Yeah. - Excuse me, Marilyn. (jazzy music) With him you'll be breaking up a beautiful romance. Now, me, I'm unattached. - I shouldn't wonder. - Shall I leave now? - You give up easily. - Try and shake me now. - Come on. We'd better get the meeting started. - I better break one up. - All right, kids, the meeting will come to order. First order of business, collection of dues. Marilyn? - I move the meeting be adjourned. (Birdie giggles) - Marilyn, would you collect the dues, please? Now, since this meeting is concerned mostly with the PMG regional race next month, I'm turning the meeting over to Joe. - Here are the entry forms for the regional. 100 mile cross-country to be held this year at Saratosa. As you know, this race is open to all PMG club members in good standing. Any member wishing to may try to win the qualifying trials, which will be held next Tuesday. Top rider will represent the club at the regionals. (bikers chattering) Now, for those of you who can't read-- - Honest, Joe, I'm learning! - Shut him up, Birdie. Give him something to eat. It says here eligibility shall consist of the following. Number one: contestants shall be free of any arrests and convictions on major traffic violations for a period of six months prior to the Saratosa Regional. Number two: any member of a PMG club who has broken the club charter by an infraction of the safety rules shall, upon a majority negative vote of his group, be deemed ineligible to participate. I have a hunch that some of you guys came pretty close to losing your chance to go in this event. The boys tell me they clocked three, four strokers doing over 90 miles per hour on city streets. - Don't look at me. I was home fertilizing my petunias. - If anyone can do it, you can, Speed. (Birdie giggles) - Can I leave the room, teacher? Because that's what this has become, a lousy nursery school. Everything we used to do, everything we used to have kicks doing, now all of a sudden it's illegal because the cops say so. - You're out of order! You're not a member. - You're telling me. I'll take things as they used to be. All these rules and regulations. That's kids stuff. - Nick wants the good old days back again. When every kid on a motorcycle was looked on as a criminal with a loaded gun. And it was. He should know that. You know why you really like things as they were? Because you let him throw his weight around, be a somebody! He's nowhere and he knows he's nowhere in this kind of a setup. - You and your cop psychology! I had 15 months of it and believe me, I'm sick up to here. There any guts left in this place? Or did you turn 'em all in when you went for this lousy charter? Anyone for some real riding? Now! Let's get outta here. Let's go. - Yeah, man, let's check out. (door bangs shut) - Couple of characters like that can louse up the whole play. Meeting's over. - This club stuff really boxes you in, doesn't it? I guess I'm the rebellious type like Nick. - [Joe] How's your hardware look? - Oh, Greased Lightning ought to be able to take the qualifying race, I hope. - Think she'll do 90 on a city street? - Uh, I wouldn't know. - Don't try to find out again or there'll be no race for you or anything for quite awhile. I'm still a policeman, Randy. - You two sound like you're talking in code. Decipher, please. - Oh, some other time. (jazzy music) After we get acquainted. Let's start now. (jazzy music) - When you say get acquainted, you really mean it, don't you? (jazzy music) (laughs) I think Marilyn just stuck a knife in my back. Would you check and look, please? (jazzy music) - All's clear on the straightaways. I uh, can't see around the curves. (Terry laughs) (jazzy music) (engines rumbling) - These bums can't give me a ride, Randy. How about you and me cutting a few? - I'm busy. - Terry'll excuse you. She might even like to watch the fun. - Take him on, Randy. - What's the matter, you yellow, kid? - Ah! You were going somewhere. Go. (engines rumbling) - Saved by the bull. (engines rumbling) (gentle music) - We should be well enough acquainted now. Now, tell me about you and the lieutenant. - I just don't want to talk about it. - What's the matter with you? You holding out on me? - Okay. I'm on a two year suspended sentence. He was just reminding me of it. - Two years? What for? - (scoffs) Guess you might as well hear it from me. One night a couple years ago, Nick and I were doing some hot riding. He'd had a few beers and, well, I was riding behind him and he made a sharp turn around a corner, knocked an old guy down. It was too late before I saw him lying there and I went right over him. - That's tough. - Ah, the old guy knocked off a couple weeks later. Nick wanted me to lie, say I saw the old guy run in front of him. But I wouldn't do it. He got one to five and I got a two year suspended sentence. Nick figures I put him in jail. That's why he's out to get even. He knows I can't fight back without breaking probation. - Okay. Get him in the back alley and try and give him a good licking. That'll get him off your back. - He can't take me in a fight. He'd want to do it on cycles in front of all the gang. So's he can be a big wheel. - Look, the cops aren't everywhere. - I'd be breaking club safety rules and washing out of the race. Worked three years to get a chance at that trophy. - So how come you forgot your scruples when you played cop-tag this afternoon? - I got trapped. Before I knew it I had to run or I'd get sent to prison. - (chuckles) What's so big about winning the regional? So they give you a tin cup with your name on it and then you win the national and another tin cup. And so on and so what? - My mother and I live in a small apartment over near the oil refinery. She has to work so I can go to school. This summer she's waiting on tables in some dump near San Francisco. - (scoffs) Oh, what's that got to do with it? - Well, all my life I've been just another kid. Average this, normal that. I want out of that rut. I want to be the best at something I do. Not third or second, but number one. If I can do that, I can prove a lot of things to myself. - Hoo! You really take life seriously. - (chuckles) Aw, it's just maturity setting in. It's painless. - I hope it's not contagious. Me, I'm for the wild and crazy rides. You're only young once and this may be that once. (chuckles) - You're funny. Talk tough. Handle a bike like nothing matters. But your eyes, they sure give you away. They say things your lips don't. - Don't you try to analyze me! - Afraid of what you'll find? - I'm sorry if I er, blew my top. - (chuckles) Yeah. I've been yakking like I've been breaking in a new tongue. (gentle music) Can I um, call you tomorrow? - Not tomorrow. I'm going riding with Nick. - Oh? Well, he sure got in the act fast. - Nothing like a little competition to make things happen. What's the matter, can't you take it? (gentle music) - I'll get my sword sharpened, Lady Genevieve. (engine revving) (Uncle Ed sighs) - Oh! Well. (chuckles) I must have dozed off on my way to the icebox. What time is it, honey? - Oh, after midnight, I guess. - After midnight? Wouldn't be a couple of hours after midnight, would it? (Ed chuckles) Well, bless my horse-thieving uncle. My watch says half past two. - Oh, now, Unc, you must be on Japanese Daylight Saving Time. - Hmm. Did you have fun? - The very most. - Hmm. Terry? - Hmm? - I don't know whether I like this or not. - Oh, men are dumb. You know, here, I've just met a fella and already I've got to straighten him out of a mess. Well, what would you guys do without women, huh? - Well, when you get to be a certain age the question is what to do about 'em. Well, I'm glad of one thing, though, honey. - What? - You didn't let him paw you around. - (gasps) Why you old weasel! You were watching! - No, I wasn't at all! The window was open. - Oh, yeah! - And I went over there to just pull it. - I know, I know, I bet! (laughs) Goodnight, Unc. (both laugh) Goodnight. - Goodnight, sweet. Now I am hungry. She must've left a little chicken or something. (dramatic music) (sirens blaring) - Cops! (dramatic music) (jazzy music) (gentle music) I could use another drink. Is there something in the house? - I don't know, but I'm not gonna find out. You hit that stuff too hard. - (sighs) Okay. I can get a little tight just looking at you. Terry, you're so beautiful. Honey, I... (dramatic music) - Don't. - What's the matter? Is Randy beating my time with you? - No one's beating your time. I'm a free agent. - That's the spiel you give me. What dialogue do you use with him? - You know, you're a nice enough guy. Until someone mentions the name Randy! - Okay, well, we'll forget about him. We'll just talk about us. Honey... - You know, someone oughta take your two heads and bang them together. It just might knock some sense into them. - I guess I'm just jealous, Terry. - Jealous? You've no cause to be. I'm free and I'm single. And I'm gonna keep it that way. Goodnight, Nick. (dramatic music) - Okay, you win. Can I come by tomorrow and pick you up? We'll go watch Randy ride to glory in the qualifying trials. - All right, then. - Please, Terry? - All right. Goodnight. - 'Night. (dramatic music) (engines revving) - You know, I'd better try to cinch up this front axle. - Great. - There's one race you're gonna lose. (engines roaring) - It's not the big one. - Says he with a lump in his throat. What's she got that I can't buy? (engines roaring) - Set to go? - Look, I think I'll take the run, too. - Sorry, chum, you're not eligible. - That's a big word in your vocabulary these days, Randy. Look, what does it mean? Chicken? - Get on your bike! Get on. - Take him away, Terry. He's all yours. - Lieutenant, I just want to go along for the ride. I don't want any trophies, no medals, nothing. Just the ride. - What's the point? - I'll set the pace. - No dice. - You've got all kind of friends. - Let him ride, Joe. - If you say so. Keep it clean or you'll hear from me. (engine revving) - Good luck. - Whose corner are you in anyways? - No corner, I'm staying neutral. - Someday you're gonna have to take sides. - [Joe] We're waiting, Randy! (engine revving) - You stay away from that smip! Small drip! He doesn't care who wins, as long as it isn't you. - I'll clump him. (engines revving) (engines roaring) (onlookers cheering) (engines roaring) - Oh! (laughs) Oh, that was a beautiful run. - You're forgetting your neutrality. But go on, I like it. - Oh, this calls for a celebration. - Name it. - This weekend at the ranch? - Great! - Oh, and bring Speed. Darlene's just mad about him. She's got some warped ideas about men. - It's a date. (engine rumbling) - Not bad. It took a little luck, but you won. You're pretty hot on a run, Randy, but how about a little close in stuff where it takes a little nerve? - Oh, aren't you tired of that song and dance, Nick? I am. - That's what the club's done to you. Softened you up. Coming? - In a minute. (engine revving) - You know, you ought to take him on. - Leave me alone, will ya? - Well! - He's making you look bad. - I'm real sorry to disappoint you. But I'm not letting him bug me out of the regional. You can call that weekend thing off if you want to. - What for? As a matter of fact, let's have a real party. I'll invite the rest of the kids down for Saturday night and you and Speed come about noon and we'll have a picnic, okay? - You got yourself a real job trying to feed Speed. - I love a challenge. Too bad you don't. (gentle music) - [Randy] I don't read you at all. - Oh, I'm really quite simple, Randy. When you settle down, as Uncle Ed says, it's for keeps. Till then I want to make the most of things. To you this is a symbol of a future and a career, isn't it? - Yeah. - To me it's a hair raiser. Something that'll do what I tell it to. I say go faster and it does. I say take a turn and it does. Ever since I can remember, someone's been telling me what to do. And this is the one thing I control. - You're kidding yourself. Beyond a certain point, the machine's the boss. I didn't want my bike to run over that poor old guy. And in court, I listened to them call me a killer. - That was a tough break, Randy. But you can't stop living because of the past. That's what's wrong with you. You're too conscious of courts and rules. I think Joe's brainwashed you. - Man, whoever built you sure knew where to put what. - Mm, well, you just leave everything where it is. - You know, you must take acid pills. But I like you. You're a real broll! Broll? Beautiful doll. Get it? - Mm, don't get any ideas. - I got 'em. - Well, forget 'em. - Forgot 'em. - There's some arguments that can only be settled out of court by breaking rules. - You're referring to Nick. - Oh, no girl likes to see someone she thinks a lot of get pushed around. (sighs) - Well, maybe I do need a good manager. - Like me? - When would you like to start? - Yesterday. - Well, uh, salary in advance? - What else? - I'm a little short on the green, but here's something. (dramatic music) - We'd better be getting home. Cy's gonna be there with the food in a while. (dramatic music) - Yeah. (bright music) - Come on you guys, let's eat, man. Come on. (bright music) Come on, cats, let's have some of them Chinese blintzes, man, come on. What's the matter, Daddio? You on the penicillin or something? Come on, let's wiggle it. - What kinda language is that? - Author-ida. Come on, man, let's wiggle it. - Ah! (bright music) - House rules. No clinching. - Oh, Uncy, don't you think you're awfully, awfully tired and you want to go to bed? - There'll be no sleep for me till this free-for-all is over. Now, break it up. (bright music) (Uncle Ed clapping) (bright music) I can't stand that racket! It reminds me of a lot of coyotes fighting over a carcass. - More like the mating ceremony of a Chinese goose. - And now is the time for them to hear some real music! (music stops playing) (guests chattering) - Oh, Uncy, Uncy, please! Anything but that baby. Not tonight-- - Now, listen, honey. A man's home is his castle. Now, any of you kids want do dance a schottische? (all groaning) (playing fiddle) - Oh, it's awful. (laughs) - Sounds a little like Guy Lambago and his Royal Caucasians. (Terry laughs) (playing fiddle) - Let's uh, jam it, Dad. You've got to give it a beat. You've got to go progressive. - Where did you get that Chinese shillelagh? - Roll it! (both plucking instruments) (guests chattering) (Randy clapping) (plucking instruments) (guests clapping) - Hi. Come on in and grab yourself some food. - Well, eat, drink, and be merry. For tomorrow's another day. You ready? - For what? - Oh, come on, Randy. We were dancing. (bright music) - I uh, didn't know Nick was coming. - Well, it was sort of open house. I didn't tell anyone not to come. - Sure of that? Wouldn't like to think you engineered it like this. He's out for blood. - You are afraid of him, aren't you? (bright music) - I was supposed to wait till tomorrow to pick a beef with you. - Shut up, Nick. - It was supposed to look spontaneous. See, I had it all rehearsed. We're gonna have words and then I was gonna challenge you to a run. You were gonna be cornered and have to say yes. - Nick-- - But I couldn't wait. Because I was afraid I'd forget my lines. I'm taking you on tomorrow, kid. We're gonna match guts and one of us is gonna walk away the winner. - See me after the race, Nick-- - I'm seeing you now, Randy! - Take him on, Randy, and get him outta your hair. - So you didn't know he was coming, huh? - It's for your own good. - Thank you, manager. I'd be no better than you if I let you get my goat. (drink splashes) - On cycles, hero. That's why I don't argue with you. - You've got to, Randy. - Anything to please the queen. She's got to have her kicks. Okay, bigmouth. I'll take you on. - You've got me wrong, Randy, honest. - I've got you right. For the first time. (engine revving) (engines roaring) - Everything all right? - Well, you're leaking a bit of oil. Nothing serious. Looks like the threads in the coupling may be a bit worn. - Don't worry about it, it'll be all right. - Yeah, man. - What'll it be? - Oh, we'll start easy, take turns. Follow the leader, I guess. - I'll string along till things get too hot. - That sounds fine. Anyone else? - Count me in, too. - This is our little picnic, nobody else's. Anybody else rides, I don't. - Well, I guess that excuse is as good as any. Hey, listen, any of you guys got any stomach pills over there because this guy has lost his. - You keep out of this. - I'll do what I like. Come on, Nick. ♪ Now I know where the yellow went ♪ - Get rolling! (engines roaring) (cycle crashes) (engines roaring) - I quit! (engines roaring) - That's not for me. It's all yours, Terry. - You gave me a run for it. I'm glad I can quit now. (engines roaring) - Wheel it! That was just a warmup. (engines roaring) (train chugging) (train horn blowing) (engines roaring) All right, now, best time to the other side takes this one. - [Terry] You're crazy, Nick! - I agree. Look, is this where you want to go home? - Ride on, Macduff. - Not me! There's a limit. - There is? That's a twist for you. - Gee, you're leaking pretty bad, Nick. - No sweat, man. - Don't go on this one, please. - Tournament must go on for Her Majesty. A duel to the finish. - Don't talk like that. - All the spoils go to the victor and all that exhaust. (Terry sighs) I'll take him. And I'll collect now. - Look, get over to the other side and handle the timing, will you? - Call it off, Nick. - You're throwing the towel in for him? - Roll it. I got a little thing going for the next one that'll really send ya. - You gonna handle the watch? (dramatic music) Well, I'm ready to go. (jazzy music) (engine revving) (engine roaring) (suspenseful music) - 85 seconds. - That'll be hard to beat. (tense music) - You're losing oil, Nick. You dropped a little oil on the trestle. Stop him, he'll hit that oil! (engine revving) - Wait-- (engine roaring) - He's started. He can't hear you anyway. (suspenseful music) (engine roaring) (suspenseful music) (engine roaring) (Randy screams) (Terry exclaims) (dramatic music) - I just thought I'd slow him down a little bit, I... (dramatic music) - Is he dead? - If he's not, it's no fault of yours. Someone call an ambulance, quick. You know, I don't think he would particularly like you around here, baby. (dramatic music) - What's the matter, baby? Couldn't you sleep? - Mm-mm. - Oh, but it's a pretty night. You smell that alfalfa? - Mm-hm. - How about Randy? - He got out of the hospital today. - Well, how come that you're here then? - He could do without me. He's made that pretty clear. Oh, I don't blame him. I got him disqualified from the regionals next week. I saw to it that he broke every rule in the book. On top of that, I nearly got him killed. - Oh. Now why don't you just go and tell him that you're sorry? - I tried to, but he won't see me. - Well, make him. A fish won't bite if it can't see the bait, honey. - You've been talking to Darlene. You think I'm a stu-ame, too? - A stu-ame? What is that? - Oh, it's just Speed talk for stupid dame. - Oh, now. - Oh, goodnight, Unc. - Goodnight, sweetie. (dramatic music) A stu-ame. Hmm. (dramatic music) (door creaks) (dramatic music) - What do you want? - I've been calling. Your uncle said you didn't even want to talk to me. - That's right, I don't! - I just thought I'd cinched that run over the trestle. Terry, I swear I didn't know he'd do a Brodie. - He could have been killed! - Don't get preachy, baby. - You'd have been a murderer. - You dreamed the whole thing up. - I think no more of myself than I do of you. I'm going in. - Terry, don't make out like I'm poison to you, please. - Take your hands off of me! - Terry, please don't give me the brushoff. I'm not like the rest of 'em. Honey, you and I, we're the same kind. We go for the same kicks. - Don't you ever, ever call me again. - Terry? (dramatic music) - Oh! (door bangs shut) (Birdie giggling) - He still broke the rules and he knows it as well as everyone else. - No, man, it's that dame. - Now, wait a minute, I was there. He was shoved into it. It'd never happen-- - Shoved, you say? (all chattering) - Yeah, crazy, man. (Birdie giggles) - You've made it, Dad, and you've got eight lives to go. You know, I hope you don't feel as bad as Marilyn looks. - When shrinking heads becomes legal, can I have yours? - A pleasure, treasure. - Scoop, coot. Feel like a ride? - Nah, not much. - You're not with little Marilyn, are you? You're with a little soft pink cloud. Look close and you'll see a name on it. It spells Terry. - You're Kafritz. She's the one who put me where I am today. - This is killing me, but she did try to stop you from crossing that trestle. - Oh, sure, that's only part of it. She staged the whole thing from beginning to end. - I'm beat. I guess I'll go home. - Well, I'll take you if you like. - Such enthusiasm! Like asking your spinster aunt for a date. Call her. You have my blessing. But if she drops dead, I'll be around to console you. - Boy, I wish they'd get through with that meeting in there. - Well, I told Cy it was a waste of time. - [Darlene] Terry, you've got to go in and see him. Now, get in there. - [Terry] I don't know if I can. - You're going in. Okay, come on, you're going to go in there. (dramatic music) - Hey, let's go, baby. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - How-- (metal clanks) - One night you told me that maturity was setting in. I said I hoped it wasn't contagious. - Yeah, I remember. - Well, it is. You said it was painless. But you're wrong, it does hurt. You know, it's amazing how wrong I've been about so many things. I realized it most when Nick said that he and I were one of a kind. - Thanks a lot for trying to stop me on the trestle. - Well, some people find it very hard to say I'm sorry and I'm one of them. - Yeah, I know what you mean. - Hey! Make with the leg you muscled. You're in! - Great! Come on! Come on, come on, come on! - [Terry] Randy! (door bangs shut) - Some of the legal beagles cooked up a case for your being reinstated. I want you to know that I fought it with all I could. - We made him see the light. - Fly, Cy! Budge, Judge! - Since you broke the club charter in your little escapade, the kids felt that a full-fledged investigation was in order. - On with it, quit the torture. - Anyway, it was unanimously decided that you were goaded into an infraction of the rules by an outside party. - That's right. - Uh-huh. - It was a consensus of opinion that you couldn't have acted other than you did and since this was a matter for the group to decide, this somewhat prejudiced jury has found you not guilty. (all cheer) (engines revving) - She's developing a knock. - Oh, no, that's my knees you hear. - [Announcer] Final instructions to PMG regional contestants. You're all familiar with the course. There are three checkpoints. Officials will be on hand. The first is 30 miles out of Attville. The second is Carson. The third is Bellamy. Good luck and get ready. - I better get in line. - Good luck. - Oh, you can do better than that, Terry. (Terry laughs) Good luck, Randy! (engine revving) - Good luck, Randy! (engines revving) (engines roaring) Well, they're off! - Hey, I know a shortcut to Joe's Station. - Wait a minute. What's for vitamins, Birdie? (girls groaning) (engines roaring) (Nick laughing) - What's so hilarious? - Hey, I just had a screwy brainwave. I bet if we fell in behind the last line of riders this afternoon, we could run the whole course and they wouldn't even know it. (laughs) - Hey, maybe if we started before they get to Attville that would be a laugh at that. - Yeah, man! - We'll have to catch 'em at Attville. They're gonna be going by here any minute now! - Hey, this is last one. - Let's get some more. Come on. (engines revving) (engines roaring) - I could use a drink about now. - Hey, here they come. (engines roaring) (Nick scoffs) Well, well, what? We gonna stand here or we gonna follow 'em? - (scoffs) Chase their tails? That's kids stuff. For what? To hear 'em cheer the winner? - Yeah, and if that winner should happen to be Randy, huh? Can't you just see the-- (punch thuds) Where's your sense of humor, Nick? - I'm a little tight. When I get that way anything can happen. - You're only kidding, huh? - I could use a drink. - Let's go to that jerkwater town. - That's what I need, a drink. - I'm with you. (engines roaring) - That's the last of 'em. I'm gonna catch them at the finish line. - The lunatics all gone? - All gone. Town's intact. Total population of 10 can now retire. - 12. But seven of them were safe. They're out in the field. You can come out, Mary. The war is over. (engines rumbling) - Any sign of 'em? - Are you kidding? They just left Attville. They've got a lot of hill climbing to do between there and here. About an hour's worth, I'd say. (engines roaring) - (laughs) Boy, this town is really jumpin', isn't it? Come on. (keys clank) - What'll it be? - What do you got to drink? - Coffee, soft drinks, milk. - (laughs) Milk, he's got. - Make it coffee, Daddio. - Coffee. Got some nice fresh peach pie. - Sold! - Four peach pie. (Nick spits) - Look, where'd you learn to make that lousy coffee? In jail? I want something stronger. - The sign says cafe, not bar. - That liquor store next door belong to you? - Been out of business for some time. - Now, I know you got something in the back room, Pappy, just go get it. - That's my business. - You shouldn't talk to Nick like that, Daddio. You insult him, you hurt me, too. - We need something to take away the taste of this coffee. - Yeah, how 'bout that? - I don't sell liquor! - Then give us some. - Finish your food and get outta here. - You stink! Your food stinks! Here's what I think of it! (crockery shatters) - I'm calling the cops! (dramatic music) (chain thuds wall) (gang laughing) - This guy is a Paddy! - I'll go take a look in the back and see if he's got something stashed back there. - Now that's what I call planning ahead. Go on. (dramatic music) - You stay out of there. - Move it, sister! - No! No! No! - Shut up! - No, please! No, please! No! - Oh, now you're a quiet one. Put her where she'll keep quiet! (dramatic music) (Hank laughs) Hey! (bottles clink) Hard stuff. - Reinforcements. (dramatic music) - What is it, Mary? (door thuds shut) - She saw a mouse. Get him out of here. (dramatic music) - What do we do with him? - Just let him sit there. - All right. - Now, we're gonna entertain you. Is there anything special that you want? How about a circus, huh? You feel like a circus? (gang laughs) But there's no sense just entertaining these three because there may be some more customers around. Phil, you and Jack go outside and see if you can find anyone. If you can, just bring them in. Hank, I know. We'll ride for 'em. Okay? (laughing) (birds singing) - What time is it? - Four minutes since last time you asked. (Terry sighs) They aren't due for half an hour yet. - (laughs) You know... - [Police Dispatcher] (on radio) Car Six... - I go for these here copper, I mean police office paramer-taters. (laughs) You know? - [Police Dispatcher] (on radio) A 215 at 2416 Elm Street. - Hey, catch those rock and roll police calls. And dig those crazy lyrics. - [Police Dispatcher] (on radio) See the woman. (man crashing into table) - Okay, you guys, it's curtain time. You see, this isn't going to cost you a cent! It's simply our way of thanking you for the pie and the ditchwater. - You shoulda choked on it! - (laughs) Oh, this one's got nerve! You know, maybe we'll use her in one of the numbers. - Better take 'em out back. Big field there, lotsa room. - After you, ladies and gentlemen. - [Cafe Owner] Hal! (men scuffling) - Come on, Daddio! (engines rumbling) - Have you had enough yet? - Enough? Uh-huh, this is only act one, my friend. - I need some fuel, Daddio. The bottled kind. You got some? - No! - I've got some hidden away. - Ah, yeah! - I'll get it. - Okay, Aunt May, well you get it. But you make it snappy. (laughs) Hey, Jack! Hey, listen, you go with her, huh? Watch her. - Yeah, sheriff. - All right, now. We're gonna have act two coming up right now. Hey, Hank, Hank. Look, don't you think we ought to do a Johnny O'Neil for 'em? - Oh, go ahead, Nick! - Okay. - Play it cool. (door bangs shut) (coin drops) (rotary dialing) - Get the police. Some of these motorcycle racers. Quick! - Foxy, huh? Thought you'd pull something like this. Who'd you call? - I didn't have a chance to call anybody. - (laughs) Too fast for you, huh? Well, just so it doesn't happen again. (telephone clatters) All right! Let's come and get what you came for, huh? - [Police Dispatcher] (on radio) Car number three-- - Any minute now. - [Police Dispatcher] (on radio) All units in-- - I think I hear 'em! - [Police Dispatcher] (on radio) Fourth and Vermont. - If he's in the first 20, he'll win. No one'll catch him. - [Police Dispatcher] (on radio) All units. Group 415 in Attville. Will repeat. APB to all police officers. Report PMG motorcyclists in group 415 in Attville. - PMG riders. Just what we need. Now, isn't this great? - I think I hear 'em! - I'll have to bust up the race. I'll need help. (engines roaring) - What is it? - I need help. Some of the boys are roughing it up at Attville. - Well, why me? I got this thing in the bag. They can't touch me on the flat! - Randy! - I'm not telling you, Randy. I'm sure some of the others'll help. - I'm sorry, Joe, let's go. - Let's take the shortcut over the hill. - Right. - You just won yourself more than a race. (engines revving) - Now, we need some audience participation because that way it'll make 'em feel more like they're in it, you know? - Oh, yeah, yeah. - So how about using them for markers in a slalom run? - You're a genius! - Okay. Come on with me. Everybody. - Look, we're staying right here. - A mutiny. (laughs) (punches thudding) (engines roaring) - They're not in there! - Hold it. (engines rumbling nearby) They're back there! (dramatic music) (engines roaring) (dramatic music) (engines roaring) (thrilling music) (engines roaring) (thrilling music) (engines roaring) (thrilling music) - Now, over here. Come on. (thrilling music) All right, over here. Come on. (tense music) Oh, one thing, folks. These aren't PMG men. They're alley cats on motorcycles. There's a big difference. Come on. (bright music) - Well, this is quite a victory celebration. For a loser. - Loser? You've won everything in sight. - Everything? - With reservations, of course. - Hey, guys, a special treat! Written especially for this occasion. Uh, with a little help of course of Beethoven and Bach and Irving Berlin and Chihchun Sun-Li. - No! - [All] No! - No, anything but that. (Cyrus singing in foreign language) Ah, come on! - Hey! - Speed. - Well, make your choice, Speed. - You know a little brainwork and you can have both! (bright music) Fracta-gooched again! (Birdie giggling) (Speed giggles) (bright music)
