We asked you to come because the Family Panel has decided to assign you a child with a view to adoption. It's a little boy who's 2.5 months old. Born in Brest on September 26. He was put up for adoption at birth by his biological mother. I see. In light of his background, the Agency shortlisted three candidates for adoption, and your application was approved by the Panel to be the child's adoptive mother. But... If three applications were approved, what about the other two? No, three applications were put forward, but only one was approved. Yours. What do I need to do now? Plead my case? No, Mrs. Langlois. We are offering you a child to adopt. If you agree, Mr. Ayyad, our psychologist, will present the baby to you, with his background, medical history... It's a baby? How old is it? Two and a half months. Less than a year old? Yes, he was born on September 26 this year. Think it over before giving us an answer. If you decide to accept the offer, you can meet little Theo later this week. And 10 days from now, if all goes well, he'll be home with you. IN SAFE HANDS Jean. It's time for school. No school today, champ. It's Sunday. It's ok. Get back to bed. Go on now. Enzo! No bugging your brother. Let him sleep. Stop! Stop! Let go! Leave me alone! I'll kill him! Keep calm. Calm down. Stop! Leave me alone! Does it hurt? Let go! Two years raising the alarm. Two years that he says he wants to be separated from his brother. Why can't we all sit down and make the right decision? Preserving bonds is the golden rule. We don't separate siblings. Why not separate them when they need it'? Why? Why is it up to them to adapt? Why can't we adapt to them just for once? Isn't their life hard enough already? I told you the kid'd catch it. He nearly croaked. Five minutes more, he was dead! Goodbye, siblings! One dead and one 11-year-old murderer! Age 9, Enzo is on tranquilizers, borderline psycho. He needs appropriate care. I'm a foster parent, not a disabilities expert. Same goes for Jason. Find somewhere for him. Away from his brother and toxic parents! It's not allowed. Bonds must be preserved. It's idiotic! We're no use. We're stupid assholes, that's all. Cut it out. The team discussed this. We understand they're giving you trouble. We're taking the necessary measures now. Can we look ahead? The future? No more teens. I can't foster for a while. I feel... The well's run dry. You've given a lot, Jean. Morning. I think I'm giving birth. No. Name and health card, please. I don't want to keep it. Your first delivery? No medical supervision? Where are you at in your pregnancy? The end, I think. - Term? - I think so. Ok, let's examine you. I'll just raise your legs. Like that. So... Breathe deeply. And I'll examine you. Ok, too late for an epidural. Sorry. It won't take long. The head's there. What's your name? We work as a team. I need to talk, call you by a name. Not necessarily yours. Push, Charlotte, that's right. Great! Clench that tummy. Pull with both hands. Pull! Keep pushing! And stop! Relax everything. I feel the baby, I can see the head. We're almost there, Charlotte. Wonderful, you're doing great. One last effort. Nearly there, let's go. Pull with both hands, and clench. Lots of air and push! Keep going. Go, go, go! That's great. Great, I'm holding the head. Here we go! Push! - You're doing great. - Nearly there. Stop pushing! There we go. Great job, he's here. A little boy. Do you want to see him? Take him on you? It's ok to be scared. Hold him, you'll be fine. Everything went fine. Elodie's with your baby and I'm here for you. I'll remove the placenta, then run through a few checks with your baby. He's ok? There's no problem? He's A-ok. I have clothes for him in my backpack. "Boy Ok, baby? You're a handsome fellow. I wrote that on the tag, is that right? Fine. There are clothes here. Let's listen to your breathing. - It went ok? - Sure. Delivery went smoothly, baby's fine. Did she feed him? - Hold him? - Not either. Touch him? See you later. "Accompanying a woman who relinquishes a child for adoption" Hello. I'm calling because I just spoke with the maternity unit in Brest. Here we are. Thank you, bye. Hello. I'm a social worker. My name's Mathilde Francois. I was sent by the County Council. To see you, to meet you. You were told I was coming? Yes. May I sit down? Yes. How are you? They're treating you well? The delivery went ok? Yes. I arrived a bit late. Too late for an epidural. It must have really hurt. Did you get a chance to see your baby? And say goodbye? No. I didn't want to. I don't want him. You know you're eligible for financial and educational assistance? To help you raise the child in a positive environment. I'll give you all the info. - All the programs... - Yes, I know. But I don't want help. I'm not keeping him. I can't keep him. I'm not here to talk you around, you know. I'm here to support you however I can, whatever your choice. To surrender your baby for adoption, we need to complete a statement of consent. I have the authorization of the county to sign your statement of consent. I alone, nobody else, will sign the statement. You remain anonymous. You chose to give birth in secret. And it's my role to protect that secret. Nothing else. I am bound to secrecy. I'll take it to the grave. I am also here to take down any information you care to give to complete a document for NCAPO. The National Council for Access to Personal Origins. We fill out the document together and you include anything you consider useful for the child. You can leave your identity in a confidential sealed envelope, so that your child can trace you. You can leave a note. An object. Or nothing. It's your call, your decision. Not all children research their origins. Very few, in fact. But if he does, one day, everything you feel like leaving for him will be precious in understanding where he comes from and the choice you made for him at birth. After signature of the statement, your baby is registered as a temporary ward of state. You will have no link to him anymore. You have a 2-month revocation period, when you can reverse your decision and take your child back. Two months to get things straight for you, to try to work out if today's decision will suit you for life. At the end of that period, two months to the day after signature of the statement, he will be registered as an official ward of state. Available for adoption. We have time. To fill out the statement, we have three days until it must be filed. We can use those three days however you want. We can talk, discuss what's going on in your life right now. Or we can complete the statement and go. How do you see your baby's future? What do you envision for him? Any particular wishes? I'd like him to be happy. In the care of people who love him. Who couldn't have children or anything. We need some photos of the baby. I can do that. I'd appreciate it. See you later. This is Isabelle from Child Welfare. It looks like we have a newborn coming in. Probably tomorrow. Are you free? I get the feeling it went well. Your son seemed happy. Yes. So let's keep visits in the morning. It's better for you? Yes. My mind's clearer than in the afternoon. But I'd prefer late morning, you know. Fine, late morning, no problem. It occurred to me, maybe you could shower before coming to see your boy. For your visits, he looks his best, puts on hair gel, scent... The jacket you gave him too. Ok. That'd be just perfect. That jacket's something else! He slays them with it. Krokodil? Gummy bear? No, thanks. I'd like to see him more often. Yes, the way things are going, we can look at extending visiting rights pretty soon. I'll raise it at our next weekly meeting. I know it's tough. But make the most of this time on your own. It's time for you. To get treatment. To get better. Morning. Can you stop by my office? It's a pain. Mrs. Richard is taken. Gaelle Crépin is down south and can't get back in time. Karine. Sorry. Nadia? I left a message for her to call me back. - What about Béatrice? - Don't know her. Mrs. Rosenn. No, you never worked with her. But she seems pretty worn out. So what do we do? We take a moment to be more efficient. No time. This baby has terrible timing. It's crazy with the teens. Crazy at County Hall. It's crazy. I'm rushed off my feet. Rack your brains. Anybody come to mind? Sure. Great. You clowns! No leaders in the locker room? That's wrong. Just wrong! Hey, Karine. What brings you here? You didn't get my messages? No. I don't check my phone much. I need a break. So I hear. I may have something for you. What's that? Sleep therapy? Sleep therapy sucks. After a while, I began to feel him. Moving. That's when I realized... I really was pregnant. Maybe it wouldn't go away. And then? Nothing. It was the last two months. I tried to be careful. Were you able to share this with your parents or friends? Nobody could do anything to help anyway. I tried to talk to my mother. But... I think... I mean... She wouldn't understand my choice. She couldn't bear it. She couldn't bear... Her daughter abandoning a child. I don't know how to put it. That being part of her life. For me, it's becoming a mother with this child that's... It can't happen. It's impossible. Yes. For me, having a child is positive. I don't love him. I can't do it. Well, it's late. Do you want a break, for me to come back in the morning? Sure. You know, if you feel up to it, it would be good for your baby if you said a few words to him. For you to explain what you have decided for him. To say you thought of him. His future and his happiness. He won't understand. He won't understand the words, of course. But he'll grasp their importance. And the emotion you put in them. I was offered a foster child today. I turned it down. - How come? - I feel like quitting. To do what? I don't know. Get a job somewhere or... I don't know. Of course you don't. - You want a lame job? - I could quit totally. Look after Pauline, the garden, you. I'm tired. It's a pointless job. We're no use. You saw that. I don't agree, I'm not ok with this. I'm fine earning for two if you do something major for us. Something useful. Quit complaining. I'm tired, too. When you don't work, you stew. You're on edge. You're not sexy. You're drab. You don't turn me on. Call back, say you changed your mind. How old's the kid? Fifteen. Alright. He's not. He's one day old. A baby. Really? Shit. I came to say goodbye. Yes, of course. "Neonatal Care Unit" Morning, how are you? You got some sleep? I said goodbye to the baby. That's wonderful for him, you know. You're ready? We'll fill out the statement. Including any information you want to give. Did you think about names? Yes, I chose two. You can choose the third. Please, I'd like that. I'd like to leave him a letter, too. Can you read it through? That's good. I'll leave it with you then. Yes, sure. Now then... Age. Do you want to give that information, your age? I'm 21. You have some way of getting home? Yes, it's fine. I'm going to college. I have a seminar later today. My name's Clara. Morning. I'm filing a statement for a child born confidentially. Thank you. If you'd care to sign now. "Adoption Agency" Fuck's sake. I'm nearly there. You ok? Wanna help here? I can't, sorry. I'm no good with my hands. Me neither. - Me neither. - That makes three of us. Morning. Morning. I'll be going. - You're sure it doesn't show? - Don't worry. Hey, Mathilde. Won't be a minute. A woman in her early 20s. It was an unintended pregnancy. After a one-night-stand with a man she barely knew. No violence, apparently. She lives in the north of the county. You ok? I don't know if I can still do this, but sure. You can do it, no problem. The kid is the apple of your eye. Simples. For sure. You know the procedure. Hi, Théo. My name's Karine. I'm a child welfare counselor. As you know, your mommy can't look after you now. She asked us to take care of you. That's what we're here for. For you. We take you as you are. If your mommy confirms her choice, people will make a decision for you. You'll have an adoptive mommy and daddy for life. If she retracts, we'll support her, help her reconnect with you. Help her look after you. Meanwhile, you're going to stay over with Jean. He'll take care of you. May I... Of course. Hi there, Théo. Can I... Hey, big man. Handsome fella, aren't you? Come here... So, let me read the report I'm sending to the Family Panel. Is your recommendation positive? I'll read the full report. I don't give a damn about that! All I want to know is if your recommendation is positive. I express various reservations. See? My recommendation is negative. Shit, it's a disgrace. I'd like you to hear why. Our psychologist agrees you're not yet ready to adopt. Fuck your stupid report! We need no permission. We want a kid. No one will stop us. You want a child, I know. I try to explain but you don't understand. You refuse to understand. The child you might adopt is not the child you might have conceived. It's more complex. You're not ready, you're headed for disaster. - We are ready! - It's just... We have so much love to give. I know that. I feel your pain but it's not only about love. Stop listening to her. She knows nothing about us. I don't claim to know you. It's my recommendation, not the Panel's final decision. I'm here to assess you as adoptive parents, not just parents. I limit risk to the child. Leave. Now. Let's go. Leave now, please! Sorry but my job isn't to find children for parents in pain. My job is to find the best parents for children in difficulty. Here you are, fella. - Let's go. - It won't take long. Just a little prick. Pacifier, just in case. There we go. Just like that. Ok, we're ready. Perfect. That's the shot. - The worst is over. - You're very brave. Here, look. Théo, I can't stay the night. I'll be back tomorrow morning. I'm going. I'll be back tomorrow around 7. You'll be here? No, I'm off. See you later in the week. Alright. You won't leave him long alone? No, he'll come here with us. Thanks a lot. Hey there. How are you? I hear your name's Théo. I like that. He had a good night? No idea. I work in Maternity. Alright. Hi, fella. How are you? Did you have a good night? Tell me. Who are you? The foster parent. You won't be here tonight, so no picking him up. Excuse me? I'm the foster parent. It's what I'm here for. Right now, I am his arms. Did he feed? Bye, have a good day. - Same to you. - Bye, Théo. - When did he feed? - 5:30. Leave us, will you, so I can give him his bath. Dimwit! She made you cry, the bonehead. Hot chocolate? Nah. Soup? You gotta be kidding me, right? Cappuccino, maybe. What do you think? Try a cappuccino? It'll be awful, but hey. They all are. Keep feeding well to gain weight. Get out of here lickety-spit. Let me take you home. The whole family's on tenterhooks. They can't wait to meet you. I'll introduce you to my wife. A bombshell. My daughter, likewise. We have a big house, no damp. That's rare in these parts. A big backyard. There's a vegetable patch, where I grow lots of stuff. Cute little rabbits, too. That piss me off when they eat all my crops. Shit! Fabien! Fabien! Thank you. - Dammit, Fabien. - What? Your python is in my living room. Shit! Why does he do that? Why do you do that? Why let it out? To get some air. Go take it back or I'll whack it. With a hammer. Two seconds. I need a replacement at the checkout. I don't give a shit! - Sylvie! - Let's move it! Mrs. Langlois, Alice, was born on May 22, 1975. She spent her childhood in Le Mans. She recalls being a quiet child. Very reserved. She loved daydreaming and reading comics. Her results at school were average and led to no particular professional ambition. She studied fine arts for a year. Then decided to change courses. With an accountancy diploma, she started out in the world of work. She is the youngest of three children. She maintains a strong bond of complicity with her siblings, as well as her nephews and nieces. She is the godmother of her best friend's child. Her father was a doctor. He now works with his daughter in the field of disabilities. She says they have a good relationship, affectionate though reserved. She describes her mother as shy and austere, with whom communication is not easy. She presents herself as a genuine, tolerant, spontaneous person. Her friends describe her as sensitive, open-minded and full of integrity. She wishes to adopt a child from age 0 to 2, of any origin or ethnic background. "Back 8 years" My name is Lydie Magre. I've been a social worker with the Adoption Agency for 6 years. It's my job to write a report assessing you and your project. The assessment involves 4-5 meetings over a period of 9 months. After those 9 months, I'll send my report to the Panel, which will decide to grant or refuse you approval to become adoptive parents. It is not my role to judge you. To trap you or investigate you or anything. My role is to give you support. Understand? We understand. I take notes to jog my memory. I'm a goldfish. You attended an info meeting this year? That's right. With Joélle, not me. What did you take away from it? That we needed to get married, firstly. So our Wedding's next month. It turns out I'm delighted to be getting married. With regard to international adoption? Did you look at official websites or nonprofits? Not yet, no, but we will. I think it's useful to know the regulatory framework. You're at the start of a long, laborious path. That may lead nowhere. Yes, we know it's hard. But anyway, our chances are as good as anyone's. What made you consider adoption? You tell her. So, there were 3 years... 4 years even, of trying for a baby. First, the natural way. We discovered we had fertility issues. I did. - I was... - The two of us, sweetheart. It was our problem. No one's to blame. So, that's when we began... We triggered the ART process. Several IVF attempts, none of which worked. After five, we stopped. Who first mentioned adoption? - You, wasn't it? - I think it was me. It took me some time to come to terms with the idea. Let's just say, it wasn't easy right away to realize... I mean, to accept I would never have a child of my own. - A biological child. - It's only normal. Later, I was the one who resurrected the idea, launched the process... What about you, sir? It wasn't too hard to give up on having a biological child? No. I take what life gives me, or doesn't. I try not to waste time cogitating and wondering why. Stéphane's very strong. He's more... I needed counseling. I saw a psychiatrist. I see. Maybe that doesn't need to be in your report, the psychiatrist and stuff. Now, everything's just fine. You know, a good adoption applicant has not dodged all of life's knocks. It's not someone whose life has gone smoothly, with no problems. Those people don't exist. In life, we all cross minefields and fields of flowers. What we want to know is if you cleared the mines. Adoption is not only the encounter of 3 people, it's the encounter of 3 stories. You must process your story. And process the story of your child. And help the child to process his or hers. Being able to stop and ask for help is extremely important. To wonder why. What about women who relinquish their children? Will I be able to love a child I didn't make? Can you picture what the child went through? Being abandoned. Mistreated maybe. Uprooted? Bonds of affection being constantly broken? How do you make a child happy if they've no notion of happiness? Now your child's here, how do you communicate without a shared language? All they say, a mystery. What do you do? If they suffer from racism, how do you support them? Tell them they're adopted? Why was I abandoned? My parents are alive? Almost always. Orphans are rare. How much did I cost you? Why adopt me? Why not give my mom cash to raise me? You're rich! Anyway, you're not my father. You're not my mother. You're nothing. What replies do you have? I don't know. What is that? A man is asking to see you. He's in the dining room. Show him in. You talk too much. Halfwit! You ass! If Nicolai Mihailovitch owed you money, naturally, I'd reimburse you. Today, however, I have none. You cannot pay me? Perfect! We'll jot that down. And I am expected to keep my composure? How could I not constantly be angry? The mother's a student. There appears to have been no violence during pregnancy. She lives in the north of the county. No known medical issues. Except a history of asthma on the mother's side. Besides an innocent heart murmur that will require regular check-ups, he's in perfect health. Although he automatically falls into the category, child with special needs. The Family Panel has issued guidelines for finding parents for Théo. You have 2 months to shortlist 3-4 files of people who meet the following criteria, in chronological order of them submitting their application, naturally. 43 years old at most. No children. Resident in the south of the county. Approved to adopt a child who may present health issues. Minor heart malformation, to be specific. I must add, to my great pleasure as retirement approaches, that for the first time the Family Panel has extended adoption of a newborn child to single-parent applicants. Théo was born on September 26. The Family Panel will reconvene in December. Lydie, you'll be the baby's case coordinator. This is my daughter Pauline's room. The children's bathroom. Where you take your baths. Here... we have our bedroom. And look... Here... we have your bedroom. Like it? I was pleased to hear you accepted. To work with you again. It's been so long. I'm pleased, too. I just hope it works out. I feel kind of switched off. I'd hate to contaminate him. You don't look switched off. All's well at home? Yeah, yeah. Your daughter? Your wife? My daughter's doing great. With my wife, it's as good as ever. You and Jacques, all good? Bad. Bad, really bad. How come? It'll work out, right? No, I don't think it will. - I left him. - Really? Fuck, that bad! For another man or... No. Not even. Shit! And your kids? The kids are a mess. It's tough, totally shit. His hands are teensy. Teensy,yeah. Hey there, kitten. Ok, treasure? Hey, Théo. Quite the dreamboat, aren't you? It's good to have you here. What's going on, fella? You're awake? Call me, that's what I'm here for. You're not hungry? Come here, pumpkin. Come on, baby. You hungry? Not my last one! Go on then, take it. Here comes mommy. Morning. Hold mommy's hand. See you in an hour. That's not how it works, as I explained last time. Let's try the park, now the rain's stopped. Let's go. I can't leave them alone. She's erratic. As soon as the kid sees her mother, she gives me her teddy. Honestly, I see why. You saw her, Christian. You'd protect teddy. Sure, absolutely. We need a psychiatric assessment. That's a good idea. Right now, she's impossible to work with. And we should suspend visits. Every time damages her daughter. And the newborn? Fine. Adapting well. Cutie. He sleeps a lot. He's very quiet. Too quiet perhaps. He's not very alert yet. Anything in his medical report? No. You're sure about the guy? 100%. Jean's top-notch. No cause for alarm, we just need to check he perks up. So, he's all good. He feeds well? Yeah, sure. When I wake him up. He doesn't cry for it. Never? Sometimes. Not enough. It'll be fine. Keep talking to him. I talk to him. All the time. I know. He needs some peace and quiet, too. You're right. Do what you do, it's great. I'm not so sure. Seriously, it's not your fault. Don't leave him on his own. He can nap next to you. And lock eyes with him, always on you, with you. Smelling you. Don't give up on him. He just needs a little help. I'll drop by every day. It's great, if you have time to say it. I should have time. The next bit is far too long. - I have time for that, too. - It's convoluted. I don't picture the costumes. "He sports a shabby, brown cardigan, knitted in a rough moss stitch. "She is wrapped in a black shawl "of openwork spindle stitch lace, just like her mourning veil." Honestly! What do I put? I can't just say, shawl, skirt and trousers. - Sure you can. - No, it's lame. They like pretty costumes, just as much as we do. Yes, but simplify it even so. Good. Good work, darling. Is that new? It's from my neighbor. A peace offering. - After half-killing me with his snake. - After what? Nothing, don't worry. Hold on, I have something for you, for Blanche's birthday. Here. You're not coming? No, I have a lot of work to do this weekend. And apparently Romain's girlfriend is pregnant. That takes the cake. It's too much. She just gets under my skin. I like her. She's thick as shit, dad. Face it. I'll have the kids over next week. Say hi to everybody from me. I'm still on Stéphane's payroll. "Back 5 years" He's letting me take my time to find something new, so that's ok. And my family chips in. I've moved. A 2-bedroom place in Quimper. It's pretty. You've researched single-parent adoption overseas? Of course. It reduces the possibilities, for sure. On the upside, less forms to fill in. I'd like to apply for approval to adopt a child with particular needs. An older child. I know I can rule out a baby now. I'll never have a newborn, an infant. That's life. Not for me. But... It's a real shame because... A year ago... we were on track, matched with a child in Colombia. If we hadn't split up, maybe we'd have a child now. I'm sorry. Let's wait before you apply again for approval. What? No. I don't want to wait. I'm ready! It's exactly as before, except I'm single, that's all. So it's not as before. I'm running out of time. It's bad enough, another nine months. You have no choice, Mrs. Langlois. Divorce is carnage. It wreaks havoc for years. Process it and picture being a single mother. I already did that. I've done a lot of thinking. I'm over it. Alright, see you in a few months. Please, don't do this to me. Alice, you need to plunge back in refreshed. You can do it. I believe in you. You did the tests? What? The tests? You did them? Sure. $0? So, he's fine. His hearing's fine. I just stopped by for some paperwork. Where are the children? Having dinner at Granny's. How about we make love? How come? It's up to you. In the living room or upstairs. We have time, I think. You're shitting me? You walk out on me. You destroy everything. And now you want to make love? What are we going to wear today then, pumpkin? This one? No, we don't like it. There we go. We like that one, don't we? You're a handsome devil in that. Théo, look at me, fella. Look at me. Upstairs, in the baby's room. Why won't you look at me? Hey, good-lookers! How are you? Hi, Théo. He didn't budge. Let's go, Théo. Up you come. Up, up, up. Bravo. Muscle tone is weak. You'll notice later, Maelle. He's very loose-jointed. Like a rag doll. He doesn't lock on it. See? There's no lock. See? Thanks, Jean. What's with hmm? Don't you see? Observe! I'm watching. But I don't see stuff. Observing a baby isn't about looking. It's about sensing, feeling. I'm not very interested in babies, actually. Go outside. Grab your stuff, wait in the car. It's an internship, not a vacation. Mathilde, Isabelle from Child Welfare. With Karine, Théo's coordinator, and Sophie, our psychologist. We're worried. Very worried. Multiple complementary observations of the baby suggest Théo is developing relational disorders. At just over three weeks, he's not very alert. Like a TV in standby mode. Waiting for something. It's very troubling and curious, since there's no correlation between the baby's behavior and what you said about his biological mother. Usually, there is. Are you in touch with her? No. You're sure the pregnancy went well? Without trauma or violence? No, I'm not sure. I'm not a cop. She told me what she wanted to tell, as is her right. I have nothing to add. We're not calling to be nosey and gossip about her. We're working for the baby. The baby's not well. I'm sorry for the baby but I have nothing more to add. She realized very late she was pregnant and couldn't solve it with a magic wand. But she managed to commit to her pregnancy and baby. She said goodbye to him. And left a letter. What was in it? You're losing the plot. You realize what you're asking? Come on! Maybe it contained something that could help the boy. No, I'm sorry, I won't divulge the contents of her letter. There is no great scoop that might help the baby. Even if there were, I wouldn't tell you. It's confidential. You believe in your work? Well, same here. Mathilde, just help us with this. From your observations, in the few hours spent with her, did you sense a strong or latent ambivalence in the mother's relationship to her baby? Ambivalence, obviously. You think you give birth and skip away light-hearted? Definitely not. Sorry, I'm very busy. Mathilde, wait. Babies sense ambivalence and take it very badly. It's unbearable for them. They don't have the maturity. It's easy, with babies, to spout nonsense. Théo sensed stress, rejection, violence perhaps. That's a fact. Somebody must articulate it. Or our baby is doomed to struggle and we can't mess up. We won't mess up with the boy! Or else we're in shit here. Crappy teens and parents, bureaucrats... The baby will not be adopted until we're sure he has felt the reassurance of a bond with his foster parent. Someone must appropriate his life story. If not his mother, somebody else! There cannot be gaps or black holes, without a link. Was that you? You cannot afford to mess up with this kid either. What do you expect me to do? I don't know. Find a way! I'm Mathilde Francois, the social worker. Yes, hello. We met nearly a month ago. Yes, the baby for adoption. Exactly. I don't know if you recall but the night after his birth, his mother came to see him. Maybe she did. I wasn't here. I wasn't on duty that night. Elodie? Do you remember the mother of the baby for adoption coming to see him the night after his birth? To say goodbye, she said. And? Nothing. I stepped outside. She stayed maybe 10 minutes with him, then she left. Alright. I wanted to be sure she said goodbye to him. Yes. There you are. Is Théo ok? Yes. I mean, possibly not. Thank you. Bye. Wait! She came to say goodbye but she said nothing. Are you sure? How do you know? I stood outside, listening in. The whole time. She didn't say a word. Nothing. Thank you. Théo, I saw you in the maternity unit after your birth. But you were sleeping. I saw your mother too. She wasn't able to talk to you but she wanted to. I want to tell you your mommy gave you up for adoption so that you would be happy. She wanted the best for you. She thought you were so handsome. She worried about how you were doing. Your mommy wrote you a letter that maybe you'll read one day. She wrote that she had good parents. She wanted the same for you. She knew she wouldn't be a good mother for you. And that it was hard. She hoped she'd become one, so her children would be proud of her. Including you. She wrote that she hoped you could understand. That she didn't know your daddy well. But he had a beautiful smile. And like her, he adored music. What if she's telling horror stories? If she traumatizes him, what do we do? Toss her in the canal. Your butt drives me crazy. Crazy. Hold on. Was he crying? I don't think so. Don't stop. Hey, fella. You need anything? Come here, you're hungry. You're hungry? You're thirsty. I'll get you your bottle. Too right! Good evening. I'm Alice, your audio-describer for tonight's performance. This is a play by Chekhov. I hope you will enjoy this excellent production. At Mrs. Popova's house. She wears a transparent, pale pink nightdress, a black, openwork spindle stitch lace shawl and fishnet gloves. Luka, her servant, sports a shabby brown cardigan, knitted in a rough moss stitch. The lights go down. Sitting on her canopy bed, Mrs. Popova drinks vodka from the bottle. She pricks up her ears. She drains the bottle, rolls it on the floor. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth! We shall fight a duel! A duel? She takes off her belt and nightdress, pulls a white shirt over her pants. I'll pop her off like a chicken. Smirnov presses up behind the lady. Hold the firearm like that. He demonstrates, shares a glance with her. Those eyes! An astonishing woman! The gun goes off. A chicken falls from the sky. - Drinks every night. On principle. - It's contractual. I'll check. There's a great little bar where we had lunch. That's 3 nights running. I'm thirsty and hungry! Coming for a drink? Yes, sure. I'm wiped out. Love ya, see you tomorrow. A coward. Abandoning us. It's like eavesdropping on a couple behind a screen. Back 2 years. You hear everything, see nothing. Sometimes, sudden silence. What are they doing? We're there to describe the action. - Interesting. - Very. It's a great job. When are you due? Anytime now. Term is next month. - Your second? - Third. After this, no more. I said that last time, too. What can I say? If you have too many, pass them on. Does your new job impact on your plans to adopt? Slightly, yes. I guess my life isn't so stable. On the other hand, my mother died and left me money that I invested in a savings account. That way, I can take longer off when the child arrives. Also... I'd like to amend my application to extend it to children with special needs. I think I'm up to handling particular disabilities or illnesses. - Not all... - No, not all. Don't say yes to them all without proper preparation. Yes, I know. I began to make a list. With my doctor. "End of revocation period Today" Now then... Hey you... Yeah, you comedian, it's late. It's time to sleep. Sweetie... Here, your pacifier. Take the pacifier. Ok, you don't want it. You can't feed all night, no way. Let's sleep now. I couldn't agree more. Sleeping's fun. I'm tempted to say green. But it's not green. Blue! - Whose turn now? - Mia. I can't get this wrong. I'll go with green. She aced it! Another? Slow down! One at a time. Feddi now. Wait for it... I think I'm in top form. It's a yellow! For sure! For sure! I guessed 14 right, at least. Well done, kids. How you doing? Good. And you? We have the Pirious. The little guy'd be happy with them. Yes, but if I can jump in, Théo had a tricky start. He needs a lot of carrying, stamina, availability. Flexibility, also. Mrs. Piriou is a lovely lady but super uptight. I think she'll... If naps and mealtimes aren't regular, she'll freak out. - Not at all. - For sure. Also, she can take 10 weeks off work, tops. - It's not enough for him. - 10 weeks is too few. Find me folks that can take on a slow-starter. Well, I think I have just the right person. Alice Langlois. She checks every box stipulated by the Family Panel. She first applied 8 years ago. She's open to special-needs kids. She comes from a large family. Very lively, very... She can take time off, working with her father for the disabled. She just turned 41. She's single. Opening it up to single-parent families doesn't obligate us to shortlist someone who's single. I feel no obligations. I just think she's the right person. Maybe you feel obligated. If you're not happy, change the law. City Hall's that way, 4 minutes by streetcar. I have no issue with single-parent families. However, I disagree with "the right person". You saw her a lot without seeing her. You botched the job. If you'd listened to her, but you don't listen, you talk. And talk. You just confuse people. It's too fast. They don't do shrink-speak. You get confused when I talk, however accessible I make it for you. Let's keep calm. Keep calm. I'm going with a profile you rarely see now. The Gautiers. Humble, simple people. With their heads screwed on right. They gave up on adopting overseas due to the cost. But they're great applicants. And they're ready. I think it's their turn. True, they're worth looking at. They've been discreet since they got approval... Obviously. Because they gave up on overseas. You didn't hear me? Who's not listening? I had another thought, Mr. and Mrs. Le Garrec. You saw them recently? Because I saw them last month. It's awful but... I think it's too late for them. They burned out. 10 years of waiting. I just saw weariness and bitterness. It's ground them down. There's a real risk it ends badly. So that's no. I really think Mrs. Langlois is ideal. How can I put it? She thinks straight. Constantly updating her application, bouncing back. Her desire for a child is alive. She always takes the positives. It's like she uses the whole damn obstacle course to become a better person. The woman is ready. I know it. What do you know? Nothing. Of course, just like you. Our job is subjective. Don't give me that shit. I'm telling you, the baby will be lucky to be with her. That's all. We asked you to come because the Family Panel has decided to assign you a child with a view to adoption. It's a little boy. Born in Brest on September 26 this year. It's unbelievable. Yes, it's... You can think it over, of course, before giving an answer. Yes but... I don't think we can. No. I'm pregnant, actually. Congratulations. That's wonderful. Wonderful! We didn't tell you, we wanted to be sure. Three months in, it all seems ok. Two at once may be too much. Yes. Hello, Mrs. Langlois. Mrs. Magre! I'm going to have a baby! Yes, I know. I'm so happy for you. Thank you. Thank you so much! How did you do it? I didn't do anything. Your file, your journey, did all the talking. It's down to you. She never buys food or cooks dinner? No. Laundry? No, or sometimes. Rarely. It's fine by me. I don't like her hanging around the kitchen. What I like is when she arrives home and kicks back... Chills on the couch with Pauline. I love that. My wife's job really isn't a lot of fun. At home, I want her to feel good, to be happy- Hold on. You do this on purpose? Do what on purpose? All that stuff you just said. What do you think happens when you say that? You know I'm into you. You can have all of me. My heart, my bed, everything. You didn't know? So now you know! Don't lay it on so thick. "Life's amazing with me!" What do I do? Kill your wife? We stop seeing each other? Stop working together? No way. You're rescuing my whole year! I'll kill her, though, if it's what it takes. But then you'll be sad. Your daughter, too. You piss me off! I don't have time for walks. I can't keep canceling my whole day to be with you. Are you nuts? I like cooking for people I love, too. We're doomed from the start. The foster parent says to call any time. He'll help with everything. You need to come every day now. - No gaps in the bonding process. - Of course. It's all organized. I have two more performances to do. Evening shows. Then I'm good. Tomorrow, you'll meet your child. Yes. That's right. You'll tell him the name you've chosen for him. Yes, I thought about it. It's awkward. If he has a name, isn't it weird to change? It's not weird. He's your child. It's your right as a mother, to name your child. It's important for you. For him. He'll cope, no worries. It's kinda dark, isn't it? You're stressed out. You're visualizing what'll happen tomorrow. Tomorrow, something else will happen. It's impossible to predict how the baby will react to the moment's significance. Or to receiving your emotion. And you might not feel the magic you expected to feel. Maybe you won't be struck suddenly by maternal grace. Perhaps I'll think he's ugly. Yes, perhaps you'll think he's ugly. Or he'll think I'm ugly. Perhaps. We're hereto support you. Not to assess your mothering skills. You are Théo's mommy. Yes. - Alright? - Great. Do you mind if I lay on the floor a moment? Not at all, no worries. - It may not be very clean. - No problem. I feel just great. Totally ready. But my tummy is kind of fragile right now. It's a pain. Tummies do that. Hey. Right. I'd forgotten it happens in here. Bummer. Isn't there someplace more appropriate? It's ugly, grim. It's ugly and neutral. This is it, time to meet mommy. Your mother. Don't worry, you'll be fine. You're a great guy. - Let's go? - Yes. You can go around to face Théo. Théo, this is Mrs. Langlois. Alice. She's going to be your adoptive mommy. You can talk to him, of course. Go right ahead. Théo, you don't know your mommy yet. But you'll get to know each other. You'll take all the time you need. Look at your mommy, fella. We'll leave you a moment with your mommy. It'll be just fine. I am so happy to meet you. And deeply moved. I'm scared I'll say something silly. You're wonderful. You've really got me. We'll get to know each other. She seems good, right? I chose a name for you. It will suit you, I think. I've decided to name you Matthieu. You are so beautiful! Can I get you something? Coffee, tea, juice? Tea. Or juice. I'd like that, thanks. So, tea or juice? Yeah. How about I get you both? That sound ok to you? Same, both. You can pick him up. Great! Go ahead, pick him up. He's not made of glass. He holds his head up well. If he's not happy, he'll let you know. He's looking very happy there. Awesome. You can give him his bottle. Position him against your side more. Lay him back. He's happier like that. That's right. That's good. Good eye contact, excellent. We'll let you say goodbye to your baby. By the way, I did as you suggested. Can I give it to him? Absolutely. Perfect. I brought you a teddy. Here. Good evening. My name's Alice. I'm your audio-describer for the performance. I'd love to describe... To meet you after the performance for a discussion. Enjoy the show. Holy shit! Shit! Dear visually impaired, we have a technical issue that will be solved in... As soon as we can. Shortly. Sorry. My mistake. Let's wing it. You're kidding me. Emilie! You got a headlamp? - Can I borrow it? - I need it. Ask Michel in the lobby. Alright, we'll have to improvise. So... Elena lvnavnova Pavpova is in her canopy bed. She rises, drops the curtains. And rolls it up in a ball. The bed. Now, bright lights! A gorgeous actor, full of charisma, enters. He breaks down the door. He's Gregory Spetanovich Smirnov wearing an overcoat made of fur. And a big hat. Grigory Stepanovitch Smirnov. You see, madam? There are several makes of pistol. You pull on this little thing here. - Like this? - That's perfect. Then you aim. He strokes her neck. With your head tilted back... She's really enjoying it. Arms outstretched. Make sure your hand doesn't tremble. The gun goes off. A chicken falls from the sky. Or not. Very well. Be off with you! Here we go, they're kissing. They hold each other tight. In a long kiss. Very beautiful, very sensual. Very, very... Very physical. It's really great. Very, very good. Is that good? Not too hot? No, it's just fine. Here you go. Dad bastes him like a leg of lamb. He loves it. You love being in your bath. You love your bath. - Alright in there? - Great! Just great. Hold on... I got it all wrong. What the heck's going on here? Mess everywhere. You can't give a bath, right? I'm sorry, this won't cut it. It won't work. Kidding. I'm messing with you. He's clean. He didn't drown, he looks happy. That's awesome. That's awesome, pumpkin. Alice, no! Hey! It was a joke. I'm sorry, it wasn't funny. I'm a grade-A jerk. Look at me. Nobody will take the kid from you. Except social services soon. Joke! Are you staying? No, I think I'll be going. Stay a while. When do you think he can go? Day after tomorrow. He barely tries to catch my eye. It goes so fast. Yeah, it's the end. It's not Asian. It's the only one open. How was it tonight, honestly? What did you think? On the inside? Weird. It was just flat. I thought I was so shit. No, I didn't think so. We've already met, right? You work here? Not here specifically. I work in lots of theatres. I'm an audio-describer. Right, got it. For the deaf. No, the visually impaired. Yes, obviously. We're going for dinner if you want to come. I'd have liked that. But tonight I can't. See you. Can I call you? Yes. In... maybe six months. Alright. Great. I feel I'm taking him from you. Not a bit. I don't want him. I kept him nice and snug for you. It's a job, I get paid. I don't know how I can thank you. Like that's just fine. Thanks! First thing is to create a bubble for you and your child. Give him time to put down roots with you. To forge a bond. For a few weeks or months, steer clear of family. Parents, brothers... Ignore your sister when she says, do this, do that. Go with your feeling. What you want to do, what you feel able to do. Give all the eye contact, give all you can. Anything that nourishes. Your smell, your voice. Your skin. Everything. To forge that bond. You won't make him a willful child. At 3 or 6 months, a baby isn't willful. Ok? Yeah. It's not labor for you, it's a transplant. You didn't carry the child, sure. But what you're doing with him is extraordinary. Few people experience that. Just wanted to say, I can't call you. It's not allowed. I won't see the little one for a while. If you want to keep me posted, feel free. No obligation. Alright, you'll be hearing from me.
