687... Yeah, that'll be 687 000 if we include these cheques. - So this is it? - Should be, yes. - I'll close it now. - OK... Would you mind prepping the alarm, too? - Should it turn on at 21:30? - No, put it at 22:00. I'll check for cigarette butts in the canteen... Thanks for today! Where the hell is Harry? - Which Harry? - Dynamite-Harry. Dynamite-Harry?! Don't tell me... You haven't thrown that half-deaf explosive wrench into my plan, right? He hasn't been sober since he blew up that parking meter on Valhallavägen! Nah, but we bump into each other in town sometimes; we are cousins after all... - What?! - ... So I thought he could show up here, like, as a guest. Quiet! We're at work. Come with me... Drill. Arrow 1. Perfect! Look, we have things to do... I've made a list of all Franz Jäger-safes in the city. What's the use of that? I mean, Jönsson's out again... Oh, is he? Alright, put it over there. [Back page: The Berns-gala will only be broadcast on TV tonight] [Front page: "WE RESCUED THE MONEY"] That's enough! Pull the tube out. Good. Tie it. Done. Pull. Alright... Arrow 2. Don't move a muscle. Good. That's enough! Now hurry up... - No... - Come on, hurry up! And bring the bag. Come on! Take this. - Just let me- - Shh! - The hole! - What do you mean, the hole? Be quiet... The modeling clay! Here! - What's that? - I made a little horse. - My horse! - Shh! - "My horse"... - Yes... "My horse"...! Is the bag ready? [The Berns-gala will only be broadcast on TV tonight] Berns salonger... Gren! - Yeah? - We're going to Berns salonger. - A bit late for that, don't you think? - Not for the Jönsson Gang. Step on it! Awwright, so this is where you are... Howdy-doo on you lot!! Harry?! Shut up, dammit! - Oh, Vanheden!! [unintelligible] - Harry, for fuck's sake! Y- you're my only... My cousin, and...! Get a grip, you're waking the whole city up!! And hello to you! Hey... Doctor Jönsson?! Calm down... - Vanheden- ouch! - Yup! Quiet! Quiet! - Wha-?! Hey... You... No! - Doctor Jönsson, may I talk with the Doc?! Vanheden, did you bring your unhinged...?! No, don't-! - Get him out... Get him out! - Make sure this idiot leaves right now! Right, now lemme take a look-see at this! Dammit, we got a fine... - The car's shit! - ... Ugh, we don't have time to deal with it! Get in, get in! - Put your hands up! - What? Put your hands up! What?!

Harry? What are you doing here? - Hi, Sickan... Hi. - Harry? What do you want? Hi! Welcome out into the open... Welcome to freedom! W-where are Vanheden and Rocky? Uh, they're- they're not coming. - Wh- they're not coming?! - No, they... They're not. But they're always here! But... Where have they gone? They're always here! Yeah, but uh... They're not... They... Everything has changed now. - "Changed"? - Yup! Lemme drive you to town. C'mon, Sickan. Well, nothing is like before. Let's forget everything that was. Let's focus on the future. Just us, Sickan... Imagine! There'll be no Rocky, no Vanheden. Eh, they're good for nothing anyways... Vanheden's even got himself some lady company now! ♪Flee me to the moon, and let me show you-♫ Let's take a look at what the sales manager cooked up... 14 days in the sun on Mallorca! How's that sound, huh? Layin' by the pool and splashing around a bit... Hey... I was thinking we'd let your old man go fishing somewhere while we're off on a love trip. Oh God, you got the tickets already! Of course; planning's the key word here. 's all timed and prepped, y'know. But there are four tickets! I thought it'd be just you and me, like... - The planning, my li'l plum! You see... Eivor's already there, you know? Rocky and Bill should go there too, obviously. We'll need people to talk to, right? There'll just be a bunch of foreigners otherwise! Oh geez! But could we at least live together by ourselves? Yeah, it'll all solve itself... Hey, I think it's about time we close up for the day. Rocky, hurry up! Right, I'm done soon! I'll... I'll just... It's this one. - Hi, Apple. - Stop calling me that; my name is Appelgren. And it is not time to close the shop yet. Look at me, I haven't tasted a beer in ten months! I'm whiter than snow! Haven't had a single drink! Not since that evening at Bern's. God, that was so embarrassing... Could you forgive me, Sickan? - See ya tomorrow, li'l plum. - But we still have a lot of wares to test! Listen, Apple: Rocky and I'll get that done tomorrow. Bye bye! So long! Sayonara! - Bye bye, then. - Arriverderci! - Tomorrow, tomorrow... - Tomorrow... Oh, Dad... Isn't he simply wonderful? He is capable, Catrin, but I still find it strange that he stopped working at the currency exchange. But he already told you... He didn't have the strength to keep that up when his best friend passed away! And then he met me... Yes, I hope you're right... But a radical change needs to happen around here. [inaudible chatter] - That's right... Now stop. Stop! - Huh? - 'sup Sickan! You on the run? - It's "Charles-Ingvar". And I would like to know where Rocky and Vanheden are. What, did they not know I was supposed to come out today?! - Is Eivor home? - Nah, she's on Mallorca. Here I finally come back and there's not a single person around... Great - you understand? - minds, huh? And that's not enough, then there's all these blasted women who talk about... ... The narrow little road, and how it's not suitable that you think everything out and- [inaudible] 'sup Bill, how's it goin'? Sickan's here. - Sickan's here! - What? Where? Oh, hi, Sickan! "Charles-Ingvar". Sure thing, Charles-Ingvar... Anyways, so you've gotten out! Lookin' pretty healthy to me. Simply brilliant, right? Whaddaya think, Rocky? Look at who's paid us a visit! Wow, long time no see, glad to see you! - When'd you come out? - Exactly 14:30. Yeah, time sure flies... Ten months, y'know! - Look, man, we've gotta celebrate this. Come on up! - Yeah, let's go to my place! Now carry this, alright? C'mon, Sickan! Have you gotten any good food, Sickan? What have you been eating all this time? Be careful now, careful! Sure can't tell that you've been behind bars the last ten months... Sickan, get in here and look at all this stuff! You can say that again; there's definitely a lot of stuff here... You can tell that Eivor hasn't been here for a while. No, we tend to clean up once in a while, actually. Hey, Charles-Ingvar... Gotta say, today's definitely your day. C'mon, have a seat. 's all measured up; just sit down! There! Just lean back and enjoy, alright? Now here's some real sounds! Bet you've never experienced this... AN ORCHESTRA RIGHT IN YOUR LIVING ROOM!! YOU RECOGNISE THAT TUNE?! Brilliant, isn't it?! And it's all thanks to honest work, y'know!! 'ey Rocky, turn it down a notch! As I was saying; all this thanks to honest work... And I met this li'l gal at Bal Palais too, y'know! - That's what's been going on. - Vanheden's gotten engaged! Yeah, yeah! We'll all go down that path... Hey, what'cha think about this? It's the Sales Manager himself! And you know what, Rocky's become a head tech guy! - Per habla Español! - Yeah, he's learning Spanish too! Hey, we're leaving on Sunday... Ten days on Mallorca; Eivor's already there, y'know. Sunshine, swimming, pig parties... The firm takes care of the violins. On paper it's a business trip, y'know... The state pays for half of it, the firm the other half. - It's brilliant, we've thought it all through. - But... I can't travel on Sunday. No, but you'll stay here and keep an eye on things... You could live here, y'know! Hold on- be quiet, alright? I have a plan. Do you understand? I have a plan. I have spent the last ten months working out this utterly fantastic plan... And wouldn't hesitate to call it the most ingenious plan I have ever hatched. Look, you have to understand that Rocky and I have taken the high road... Things are goin' pretty well for us! We can't hang out with old convicts- - What, don't you understand what I am saying? - Yeah, but I doubt you get what's goin' on, Sickan... Rocky and I have left the crook's life behind, you know. Oh, please make up your minds already. Would you like to participate in what may be the heist of the century... ... Or would you rather fool around at some pig party on Mallorca? - We'll have to go with Mallorca, y'know. - Yes, and Eivor! Fine, then. You've... Made your choice. We have nothing else to say to another. 'ey Sickan, don't get the wrong idea! Hey! It's always nice to have you around, but things have changed a little, y'know. You're always welcome here. I know that you know that. Look, do me a favour and take this. I know things are a little tough when you've just come out, y'know... Yeah, what'd I tell you? Honourable and unreliable. Right? Eh, nothing to slump your shoulders over. No... Now we're going to my place. You could crash at my place. I've got the space. Hop on up! No thanks. I prefer walking. Right! L-let's take a walk then. That's my kind of thing, you know. You see, I've been taking a lot of walks recently... And I don't drink beer, not even light beers. I'm a proper person... So, this is how I live. Hold up, hold up! You should sit well. Sit comfortably. Watch your head! Voilà! Uh, that's some homemade crafts... Come on, sit, sit! Maybe you would like a pillow? There! And then I'll take care of you. Let me take care of you. Well... Do you want a beer? Of course you should have one! So, here's some pleasant, cold, frothing beer. A-as for me, I don't drink any. I'm a proper guy, diligent. Not a single drop! But it happens that I get my friends some... Now we need a tablecloth. Wait, wait a second here! Let me fuss over you for the rest of your life. And a glass; you've got to have some style to it! There you go! Pour a big glass up. Yes, er... And then you- nononono! Then take a big gulp. Let it run down. Can you feel, like, how it warbles and ripples and rolls around... ... And then it does a little flip and goes to sleep? And then... Go on, there's no shame in burping, it's just natural. W-would you like another? Or maybe a cigar? You should have one! I've saved one for you. Here you go! Wait, wait! Let me put some effort in for you. There you go... Yes? No, your old compatriots, that Rocky and Vanheden... What are they? You've got- You've got me, and you know I'm... Ugh... I am... I mean... That Rocky and that Vanheden, they're nothing- but you have me! I am your friend! And I... I'm up for anything. You've got me, and together we'd... We'd probably... Whoops. There! - You want a beer? - What? No. But I have something you wouldn't say no to! A gift! - "Gift?" - Yeah... Right... Let's take a look... Here's the locale. And do you know what's in there? What could it possibly be? A real Franz Jäger-safe. - Franz Jäger... - Safe. - No, it's over there. - Not bad... That's not bad at all, Harry! I actually need some money to finance my plan. - So, everything has been planned down to the last detail? - It's all timed and prepped, yes! Then we're taking the safe tomorrow. Quiet! - Everything's ready? - Yes it is! Right, now just cross the yard and go to that window. Here's the stuff. Goodbye, have a good one! You aren't thinking about running away as well, are you? - No... N-Never, not on my life, I- - Then we're going. Be quiet and follow me. - Now hurry up! - No, that's your job. - What?! - N-no, I shouldn't... The safe's right there! - But... Don't you get it?! You have to help me! - With the rubber gloves, and the tal-! - Shh! - Huh? - And the stethoscope, you have to help... - The bag! - Right, right... Come on, point the light! And keep it there! - H-hey, point it at the safe! - Right... There. - You done soon? - Shh! This is just... Utter shit! It's worth nothing! What are you doing here?! We work here... We get Bulgarian TVs SEMKO's seal of approval. And what are you doing here, huh? I... I'm working here too! Wh... S-Sickan, you can't do that, this is our safe! I- I knew that!! That's why I opened it! Right? Yes, feel free to look inside! I opened it so you could see what a great deal you've made! That's your future: folders and papers and... All kinds of things! Right?! What a good find!! That's right, y'know... There's not a single nickle. - What, is there no money? - There's not an öre, y'know. But y'know, the geezer's a smart guy... Like he'd put any money in a safe that's that easy to open! Put your hands up, thugs! - Please, Apple... - This was what I thought all along... - Mister Appelgren, you know... It wasn't us! - Finally I've gotten you! Hey, man... Seriously, it wasn't me, it was another- I'm no thief! I'm an honorable guy! - Let's discuss this at the police station. [unintelligible] - Look, seriously, shouldn't we talk this over first?! I don't even have anything on me! C'mon, this is horrible... Welp, now they're taking them away... That's just as well. Seriously, it wasn't me!! It was someone else- - Hey, thank you for the gift. - Oh, it's nothing. Quiet down, Rocky. It'll all solve itself, probably. We haven't even done anything! Owowowowowow... Do you have a nail? It can't be corrugated... Are you listening? I want one with a round head that's about... This length. Let's see... This one's good. I'll take that and you'll take this, understood? - We don't have much time... - What am I supposed to do, then? We're supposed to free your father and Ragnar Vanheden! You must hurry up! But how? I have a plan! Not to brag, but apart from the police I probably am the one who knows the most about prison transfers... We should take a closer look at that one. Follow him. 1-11 calling for 70, over. Well, um... Two prisoners have escaped during transfer on Fleminggatan. Yes, we'll need reinforcements. Over and out! 70 here, calling all local vehicles: two prisoners have escaped from transport vehicle 1-11 during transfer on Fleminggatan. Stop the vehicle and investigate the area. Over and out. 5-15 says: understood. Over and out. - What happened? - What do you mean? How'd the prisoners escape? Nobody's escaped, what are you talking about?! We'll have to check the back. There was a radio report... Why are you opening- they're still sitting here! What are you talking about, "escapees"?! That short n' fat one is a total imbecile! We don't have to worry about'em, what the hell?! - You can't act like this, alright?! - But somebody raised the alarm... These guys won't run. I bet they wouldn't even if a turtle was chasing them! 'aight guys, now scram. Clear the area so we can get out of here... - Something's not right... - Whaddaya mean? They're just sitting there! - Come out quickly. - Sickan? Stop talking! Get out immediately and bring Rocky! - Get out, Rocky! H-hey, come along... - What's gotten into him? Think he's having claustrophobia, y'know. Come on, Rocky! Come on! - Are you the one carrying two prisoners? - Yeah, what about it? Well, I think they're not there anymore. They just escaped. Oh, thank you! Don't you try pulling any jokes on me, alright?! They've escaped. - The trunk was empty when they arrived! - Who? Half of the Jönsson gang! But they're already wanted. We've sounded alarms all over the country, it's no problem. It's good that you are going by the book, Gren... But you can shut the alarms off now. The report has been retracted. What do you mean? Half of the Jönsson Gang is gone! Gren, we don't have time to talk about this right now. - I have other things to worry about! - I guess... I finally, after all these "ifs" and "buts", have all available personnel at my disposal. This is a big case... Possibly the greatest of my career. - You got any plastic rulers? - Yup, here it is... Here, Sickan! - 'ey Harry, you don't happen to have a beer, too? - Yes, the light's loaded! Here you go... Don't have a blackout, now! That's tasty, that. Well... How is it? Hitting the spot? Oh, that's... I think I'll also... No, I'll go for a walk instead. - I- I'm out for a bit! - How's it goin', Sickan? Ow! Hiya, Sickan. Did they get you too? C'mon, Rocky, don't you get it? We're free, y'know! What? Then what about our jobs? Oh, that's right... We had a great thing goin', then you came in and suddenly we're on the run and wanted by the cops. What a mess! Do you have a clue what you've done?! - Who is the constructive, creative one in this group? - Me. And who's the destructive one who ruins everything and gets in trouble? Then I arrive to save you... Yet you start complaining! - That's 'cause we had a good thing going- - And so have I! Come on, then! This... Is a big heist. Possibly the greatest in our career. I shared a cell with an attorney who once worked for The Syndicate. However, he knew too much, and got uncomfortable. Now, all of the attorney's knowledge... Is mine. I have studied this case for the last ten months... We have been looking into this matter for ten months... ... And now I know who's the mastermind behind the syndicate. Turn that off, please. All traces lead to this trade building in Värtahamnen. Polar Frys Aktiebolag. They import and export deep-frozen goods. Subzero storage rooms and specialised trucks driving all across Europe... The perfect camouflage needed to cross borders. On the surface, a perfectly legal and respectable company. Their own guards control everything transported into or out of the area. Besides, they regularly investigate the area. Wall-Enberg often receives international guests... All well-known. Small and medium-sized fish alike from the underworld. We have been tracing them, and charted even their smallest affairs. This is... Wall-Enberg. Doubtlessly the brains of this operation. And now, gentlemen, a close-up of... The safe! Wall-Enberg's safe! - Sickan, you're saying it's a good ol' Franz Jäger? - No. On the contrary... It's a hypermodern, precision-built work from Switzerland. Immune to fire, lockpicks and explosives; impossible to get into unless you know the code. But... Then what'll we do? Apart from Wall-Enberg, I am now the only one who knows the code. That was what his attorney knew too much about. These are Polar Frys's headquarters, and this is our observation post on the other side of the road. We have been observing and recording everything that happens here, both visuals and audio. I can only tell you this out of trust. The post has been invaluable to us... But unfortunately, illegal. There could be issues if the press were to find out about this, so refrain from revealing it to anyone. I mean anyone! - That's the police's apartment used for espionage. - Police?! Yes. They're all equipped with binoculars, telephoto lenses, tape recorders and wiretaps. All the methods they could use. And then there's Wall-Enberg's office, located on the fourth floor. ... And this is the sewer exit, beneath the harbor. We'll enter the building via the sewers, on to this tunnel beneath the freezers. Get up near the freezers, enter the headquarters and take the lift up to Wall-Enberg's office... Which will contain about 150 million crowns this week. Not to mention! Anywhere between 6 and 10 million... In black money. Wall-Enberg will really struggle with explaining that! There is no doubt he'll travel abroad soon so we must strike at just... The right... Moment! All he's waiting for is for a German visitor to show up. That is the time. We must be on our guard day and night. This case would receive much attention from the media if it were to be cleared up, and is of great importance... N-no, not just for you! But also for me. We will use some overcoats, one of a fancier model, preferrably with a fur collar... A Mercedes with a German license plate, and a motorboat. The total cost would be 15 684 crowns. - Oh, that's cheap! - Yeah, but how are we gonna earn it? - Through the insurance company called "Trofast". - "Loyal"? Mhm. Not a big heist, but we don't need a lot of money right now. Granted, they don't have a Franz Jäger, but they do have a Marshall. You can pick those, isn't that right? - That's your speciality? - Of course, it'll be a piece of cake. Their night guard may be an issue, but you could handle him with the help of a vacuum cleaner, Rocky. - Hold up... What model is the safe? - 10-1969. 69-Marshall... Oh, that one's got a 10-toothed bolt and a rotating container. I can't crack that. It'll need to get blown up... But Harry fits neatly into that part; he's white as snow, y'know, so he'll do great. Never! I would rather find another safe... - Hello! Would you like a vacuum cleaner? - What, in the middle of the night?! It's a Kallevalla 600 GT that automatically empties its bag and has a flexihose. - It's 23:50... - Please, we have 17 kids in Rovaniemi! - So much energy goes to heating when you use gas... Come on, take the chance! - Eh, why not... - Oh, so you'll buy a... Eivor's vacuum cleaner? - Yes, yes. Do you have a blue model? ... It's fine, I wouldn't mind brown either. Great! I'll collect the payment tomorrow and bring the warrant. Well, this could be pretty damn useful around here. - Oh, that's brilliant... Camouflage so good it looks like the wall. - That is the wall, idiot! - The safe is gone! - Nice! Let's leave, then... - The hell are you doing? - I haven't done anything! Brilliant, Harry! Hey, check it out. - Hurry up, then! - Well, uh, look... - There's no time! What are you waiting for? - No... I-I don't know if I can handle this, guys... - Just hurry up! - Right, right, don't push me! - Now let's have a look... - That's brilliant, Harry. Don't fight, guys. It'll probably go just great. You got all the ropes? - Aren't you done yet? - Soon, soon! I just have to attach this cable to the wall. Brilliant, Harry. Right, we're off! It's gonna blow! Ow! What the... There was a lot of pressure in that one! - It's the same every time! - Just calm down, Sickan. Something's wrong with the wires, y'know. - Get it fixed, then! - Papa's gonna take a look at this. - We have to hurry! - That's the female, isn't it? - And if so that's the male... No wait. It was the connector. - Hey. Hurry up. We'll throw the poles around, then we put the connector... Here. There! Now it's ready. We just have to push the button... - Just do it, then! We don't have the time!! - Huh? Right... Now- now- now... Oh, just press it!! Hmm, wonder if something's wrong with the vacuum... What if the plug is too weak? You blockhead, you amateur!! You can't do anything, not even put two electrical cables together, you-!! Yep, I made a goof. Wait a moment... - A "goof"... It's all over, it's- but he's- - Here we go! Just a second! Take this freak and haul him off somewhere!! How peculiar... Never seen anything quite like this! Why, that could be outright lethal! Hey... Hey! Sickan! Wake up and check this out! - Look; it's brilliant! - ... Of course it is... Harry... That's clever shit! Clever shit... Harry? Hey! Hi! Remember me? Weren't you supposed to come back tomorrow? Yes, but look, the clock's ten past midnight now, so I was thinking... Since you were so fond of that blue vacuum, the one I didn't have, I thought I'd come pick the brown one up, and you can get the blue one tomorrow! No, dammit! Look, just take this back. It's dangerous... - The fuses just keep going! - That's great! - I'll take this back, then... See you some other time! - Alright, alright, farewell! What a goddamn mess tonight has been... - Is the boat OK? - Yep, engine's runnin' as smooth as butter. - Status of the fuel? - Tank's full! And the key? The key...? Here. - Make sure not to lose it, now. - Take it easy, Sickan. What a friggin' blast! ... This means we have the inspection rounds there. The guards swap over there... All step by step, minute by minute, and second by second. That's fantastic and it'll go well. That's right, y'know; we rip'em off every time. I've written two copies of this, one for each of you. Make sure to memorise this down to the last detail, alright? Yeah, yeah. What a friggin'... What a blast that was! Yeah yeah, Harry, that was such a fucking blast. You handled that explosion perfectly. Now go to sleep! What a friggin' b-... What a blast! Only one small detail remains... - What's that? - Learning how the security system works. - Oh, we'll get that done in no time! - Yes, yes. Just tell us... When? Tomorrow... After office hours. Right, Ms. Lundberg, I am leaving for the day. Is everything ready for tomorrow? - Yes, Sir! - Good. Have a good evening. Wall-Enberg's going home now. There's a car here. A German car, from Düsseldorf... Haven't seen that one before. Could that be his German contact? Study him closely. - Maybe I'll finally catch them... No, don't lose sight of him! - N-no, of course not! B- but the director, he- he's already gone... and then you stand there saying... - Would you like to leave a message? - What? Yes... No, no! Yes... No... No... - Did something happen? - No, we made a mistake. I'm terribly sorry! Right! That's him. Only the great German Bulvan could get away with this behaviour. It looks very tax deductible and nice, yes. Whoops... Whoops... Oh dear... Well! - Shouldn't I ask the director to telephone? It is... - There he is! - Make sure that he's tracked! - Blue light to Orange, over. - Orange is ready, over. - A silver Mercedes with a German license plate is coming. Follow it. - Right, we'll take care of it. Yeah, it's all fitting together! You're ingenious; simply brilliant, Sickan! Sickan, we're really lucky to have you! Yes, yes... And you're not too bad yourselves. Right? Yeah. Wh- when we're together with you, that is. As long as we keep together, just the three of us. Now let's go to my place! No no no, we'll have to lay low and wait until it's dark outside. Then we can start. Again, everything is planned down to the last detail. We'll start our mission at 00:45... Gentlemen... The time has come. You have received your instructions... Everything's prepared. Our society expects us all to perform their duty. And tonight, we'll all follow our old motto: "Be prepared." We'll take action early tomorrow morning. Can you hear that? What if the police shows up? Whatever... Don't you worry, they've probably got other stuff going on. Put your hands up! Now we've got you! Welcome home, guys! Look, Catrin and I thought we'd invite you over for a party. - Ragnar... Ragnar! - Oh, it was all a misunderstanding! - Dearest Ragnar! - Yeah, that's right! - Could you forgive me? - Sure thing, li'l plum! - Don't worry, dad, I've cleaned up. - Wow, that's great! - Are you sure you can forgive me? - Yeah, of course! Come on, get inside! Take a look at what Catrin's prepared! That's brilliant! Look at how nicely the table's done, Rocky! - Now tell us, what happened? - Happened? We're just celebrating a bright new era! We'll forget the old times... It was all a bagatelle. Now, Apple- sorry, Mr. Appelgren, you didn't think... Call me Apple! - Bring me that little cup, dear. - Sure thing, sweetie. We've got sugar and cream there. - Pastries? - Sure, thanks! - We'll strike a great deal. - Psst! Right... Excuse us for a moment, a good friend of ours is here. He's a bit ragged, so we should probably check if we could help him somehow. You'll come back, right? So... What's up, Sickan? We have to get started within a few hours! We don't have any time to waste here! You know... We'll have to do this another evening. - What? - We've got guests now! Tonight is no good for us, y'see. But- look- The whole plan relies on the fact that we'll do this tonight, it's all-! Quiet! You have to understand that this can't happen any other evening... It can only be done tonight, got that? Nah... We'll have to consider doing this some other time, y'see. We don't need this anymore, after all. Things are good again! We just got our jobs and the whole firm back; we don't need this, right? God, have you lost your minds, don't you get that we had planned all of this down to the last-!! Just be quiet! Your plan's a work of genius, we get that! But listen... At some point in your life you gotta take a stand, right? You gotta take some responsibility: build a home, a family and, yeah, you know... 'Sides, you gotta consider the human side, right? My li'l plum's counting on me, I can't just betray her- B- Don't you dare talk about betrayal!! Look, who is the one to... Betraying me is just fine, is it?! Don't-! Don't take it that way, now... You know that you're always welcome back here, anytime! I swear to fucking God, just make up your minds already... Either you stay with them or you stay with me! Weren't you going to come back? - Yep... We're coming! - Yeah! See you! Let's toast for the future. Brilliant! Harry! Harry, you have to help me. They betrayed me! You must help me with the boat! - No, I won't do that. - What? - I'm no good with the sea! I can't even stand a normal glass of water! - But Harry, you have to help! - Come on, Harry, don't you want to be a millionaire?! - No! Sorry, but I'm good... You'll have to make it on your own this time. I'm not getting on the boat! I'd do anything for you, Sickan, but not that... Not out in the boat! The key... [singing] But above, the stars get to hear the song I give to you One day I will sail to the shore One day you will be in my arms One day, my friend, they will tell the story of the one who returned One day, in the land of dreams, the two of us will walk hand in hand, That's right! One day, my darling... ... I will come home to you! - Cheers! Three? Hmm, it will still work. It's time. Right. Dear youths... Soon you'll reach the shore together. But remember that there is more to life than love. You're so right, Apple. Sometimes you gotta have a little banana as well, y'know! Exactly! So, I was thinking that you would become my equal... Oh, that's brilliant, Apple! Certainly! The video business belongs to a younger generation, after all... How's that sound, Rocky? Vanheden's Video, or maybe... Video-Heden? That's a nice one. Video-Heden! ... But you must put some work in as well. That is why I have prepared some papers to make it official. Sure, hand the papyrus over! Got myself a pen here, y'know. Your contribution will be 85 000 crowns. Just some old exchanges that would get carried over. You can't start anew without finishing your old business, after all... - 85 000...?! - There's no hurry; we could wait until Thursday. - Thursday? 85 000 from me?! - Yes. Ragnar, honey... I hope you don't think we just want you for the money? Wh- what's the big idea here?! Ragnar, darling! You can't just run away like that! Ragnar! Where do you think you're going, Ragnar?! Harry... For fuck's sake, Harry, wake up! Where's Sickan? Huh? He- he took the boat. I think he's drowned... - You think he really has drowned? - Of course he hasn't! I'll check it. Yeah, no, it's fine now. Yeah... Think I'll go inside and check, just in case... OK. Hey, would you mind turning the alarm off in ten seconds? OK. No, it's green here... Mhm... Man, the chief is a real goofy bastard though... I said goofy. He plays with tanks. Whatever, I'll leave the room in five seconds. Would you turn the alarm on? Alright. The hell? Again? We're gonna have to do a detailed check, guys. That's brilliant... Look, he's still around, y'know! - You think he'll want us back? - Of course! You heard what he said... He can't make it without us, you know. Whoops... - Is it dangerous? - Just get a move on! - Hey Rocky, remember which way it was? - Let's wait here. Sickan will probably come. - Shh! Somebody's coming. Let's leave! - Wait! - Hello?! Open! - Hey, listen... That's Sickan, right? Open! Here... Listen. You can hear him, right? Look... Fuck. It's barred up, y'know... Then what do we do? We need a blowtorch or something, don't you get it? Or wait, no, I've got it... This is so smart! Hey Sickan, just stay calm. Keep it cool, I've got a plan! Help! What the fuck?! Open! Open, you goddamn... It's cold in here! You can't just close-! For fuck's sake!! Fucking... Shit... Chicken... Heeelp! - I was sleeping! - Get up, for fuck's sake; it's life or death! - Don't wanna! - Hurry up! You coward! - I don't wanna! - Just get inside! Here's the morning snack! Cordon the area. Blue light to all units: cordon the area. I repeat: cordon the area. Oh, gag me with a spoon! Get a grip, Rocky! Now what do we do? Yeah... What do we do now? Hey! I think I've got a plan. No, stop it! Let go of me! - You can't do this! No, I won't let you! - Just jump on in! - Come on! - Stop! Let me out! You can't do this to me! Let me out! Stop! Help! Help... No... No...! Hey, you should take this. - But will this work? - Of course it will. Believe in Vanheden! There... Take this too. - Oh hi there, here we are! - Where the hell have you been? Well, you know... Once things get dry we arrive as soon as possible. - Where do you think it is? - Over there, probably? There! It could be there! - Where do you think he is now, then? - We'll have to make a guess... So, was this the place that needed some blowing up?! Y'know, there's a small problem... We don't really know which freezer he is in. No problems! We'll blast the whole thingamajig! Damn, Harry, sometimes you can tell that we're cousins after all! Yeah, yeah, stay calm, I'm... I'll handle this! - Are all the patrols done? - They're in position and ready to go. Good, good, good. Now nothing could go wrong. Count down 20 seconds. Blue light calling, stand by for a countdown. 20 seconds. This little fella goes to this fella, and that one goes to that... I'll take this fella there... Which goes here... - Harry, how's it going? - Just fine! Get a move on! Ready for the countdown! 10... 9... 8... ...7... 6... 5... 4... ... 3... 2... 1... Now. What a friggin' blast! Guys! Guys! It is served! - Hey, Rocky! He's not there. - Not there either... We'll take the next. Sickan! We're here now! Hey, be careful! Watch out! Come on... There there, Sickan! There... - Woah, he's so cold! - Hey... Just get moving! - Do you think he's alive? - Can't you tell? He's breathing! Right... Heave-ho! ♪Ratti-ratti-rajan!♫ I want this safe opened immediately. This is an outrage! Such insolence! I object! - Inspector, I have caught Wall-Enberg. - Excellent, Gren... - What is the meaning of this? - Sir, you are arrested. - Well, how are you doing with the safe? - It was already open. - Pardon? - It was already open. No...! Quiet, Rocky! This bag is stuffed to the seams with money! Woah! B-but there's this darn lock... What a friggin' lock that is! You're a genius, Sickan! That's one real friggin' lock, though, but papa Harry will handle it! Opening locks and stuff... Let's drink to that! 'cause you're keeping them cold. You're brilliant, Sickan! What would we do without you? Y'know, we're lucky to have you! - Keep going! - You're a genius, the best without compare! Look at how warm he's getting! More! Y'know, Sickan, we'll never cause you trouble again, 'cause you're the one making... The rules... Look, there he is! You are the best; the artist! - You're the light of our lives... - The... money... Rocky has it, y'know! Hey, Rocky, get the money! - No, you got the bag... Wait! - Me? You were the one who... H-hey, Harry has the bag... He's still in the car, y'know! It's all fine! - No... Not the money... - A-alright, Sickan, I'll get the bag, y'know. - Not Harry... - Harry? Stop! Stop that, for fuck's sake! - It'll all get better soon. There, there... - H-Hey, Rocky!! - What should I do? - Come! You gotta hurry! - Just come! - I'm coming! - It's totally insane. Hurry up! - But what's the matter? ♪The butterfly's shrieking...♫ - The money... - Fire in the hole! How'd it go? - Hey, Sickan, I-! - No! Take it away! Throw the bag! Sickan, you alive? Woah, you look whole: that's just fantastic! Come on... Throw it away! Thank goodness, I was getting really worried. What a fall! What a terrible- - Hey, let it be. Don't do anything- - No! My money!! [unintelligible] Watch out for the bag!! - Oh dear, oh dear... - What a... What a blast! Talk about black moneyyy... Hi... Oh, Nisse! Little Nisse... Yes, look! There! Look at all the birds! Look! [Translated by JojoVV, mostly based on Swedish subtitles by Maria Lindgren]
