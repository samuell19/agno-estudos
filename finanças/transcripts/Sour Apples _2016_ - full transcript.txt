When one dies, they say two angels ask you questions. If you can't answer, you are tormented. God forbid. So you have to remember. But don't worry, I'll tell you everything. Everything I have. How will I tell you? Province, Giresun. Republican People's Party: %36,38. Justice Party: %30,63. According to unofficial results, the Republican People's Party has won the mayoral election.

Republican People's Party: %46,70. Justice Party: %42,27. According to unofficial results, the Republican People's Party has won the mayoral election. Everyone told you not to run for your third term. But you did and you lost. Sorry, Mr. Mayor. Sorry, Mr. Mayor. Sorry, Mr. Mayor. In that city, you planted the most beautiful orchard in the world. -And I met him in that orchard. -Şino. -These are big! -Özgür. -Shake the tree, man! -What? Do you want us to fall down? Don't you move, you rascals! -Cousin, wait! -Stop. Don't run! Don't run! Stop. Come here. Rascals! Who's up there? Come down! -Come down. -Alright. -Alright. -Quick! Come here. Come here. Come over here, to the light. -That was Şino running, right? -I don't know. You just happened to meet here, then! Yes. I think that's what happened. -You're not from here. -I'm from here. I'd know. You're not. You look like the men in the photo novels. And you speak so nice. -Thank you. -Who are you? My name is Özgür. I'm from here, but I've never been here before. -I'm Şino's uncle's son. -And that wasn't Şino? -I don't know. -You don't. I'm from here, and a stranger as well. -Aren't you ashamed, thieving and all? -I'm sorry. Do you kill people for a few apples here? -What's wrong? -You reek of something. Come close. Come close. Alright. Bend your head down. -What? -Bend it down. Bend your head down. Your hair. It's coming from your hair. Shame on you. Why does your hair smell? Why shame? It's just shampoo. -What? -Shampoo. -What's that? -Shampoo is like a liquid. You put it on your hair. -Then... -Go away. Want these back? -Keep them. -Thank you. Don't tell the others, the gun is empty. It's just to scare away. But my father would beat you bad, for real. Go away. Go. Men don't smell. That's a shame. Go away. Go. I got no sleep at all that night. I couldn't forget the boy's face, or the smell of his hair. Honorable Mr. Servet... -He isn't the sultan, he's your lover. -What? Lover? What do you mean by lover? Sister. Three days and still not finished? Why have you come? We can't all disappear. Go away. Give me a photo novel. Come here. Come. -In your dreams! -You... -Will you write it or not? -I'm writing! -Honorable Mr. Servet... -Let's say "My honorable Servet". "My"? I have yet to see the man's face! If Dad heard those words, he'd beat us with a belt! Words matter, Muazzez. Write. If you are serious about this as well... -If... -You are serious about this as well and your family is also -of the same mindset as you... -Slow down. You're as slow as I'm excited! -I'd be faster if I knew how to write. -Here. Write. I'm busy, dear. Muazzez, I guess you fancy a beating. Shut up. Write. -I am. -What did you write? "If you are serious about this..." As well! As well... And your family is also of the same mindset as you... Visitors! Muazzez, run! -Hurry! -Muazzez, run! That city was known for two things. The Mayor's orchard, and the Mayor's daughters. -Have a nice day, Adem. -Thank you, Mr. Engineer. My God, grafting is such a magical thing. You graft a branch to a sour tree. Basically, you're giving directions to the tree. "Change your habits", you say. "Don't be sour, you fool." "Be sweet. Don't stay green. Get all red." Mr. Mayor, I wonder if we should leave some of these apples stay sour? Why? I don't know. Grafted apple trees are all over the place, after all. These are original. -Some would make great wine. -Wine? Another reason to cut them down. I didn't mean that you should do it. Trees are just like people. You have to tame them. At first, every person is sour. Acrid. You teach them, school them and they're sweet as honey. There, just like this one. But then some don't take to grafting. The same air, water, and fertilizer. But look at the result. Shame on you! Your friend right here can't even look at you. It's been a whole year, and 11 apples. Shame on you! Safiye. We exchanged glances twice. I threw photo novel glances in both. Like this. There are nicer glances in those books. Is that so? Do one, then. There you go. -Where were we? -What? The letter. "My mother will ask my father. If he deems it suitable as well..." Then it'll be suitable for your family to visit us. -We said it twice. -What? -We said "suitable" twice. -Well, it will be! Fine. -Then... -It'll be suitable for your family to visit us. Of course, if it really is you in the photo you sent me. What's with all the "if"s? Don't write it if it's wrong. -Go on, write. -Türkan. Hide it! As we end our letter... May God bless him who ends this letter! Amen! Right, as we end this goddamned letter of ours... Look, I repeat, if you are serious about this as well... It's hard enough to write this once. For God's sake, don't repeat anything. I send my regards, and kiss your eyes... Should I kiss him on the eyes? Kiss the man somewhere and be done with it. Alright, where should I kiss him? -His cheek. -Of course! Write. I kiss you on the cheek. On the... ...cheek. Lady Türkan. No, just Türkan. Türkan. Thank God it's over. Add "I expect an urgent reply." Add that. God give me patience. Reply... -If I don't receive your reply... -Sister! Alright. Take this. Let me tear it and fold it. And once you steal an envelope from dad, all is done. Looks matter too, Muazzez. The cheek part isn't too much, is it? I shouldn't kiss him at all. Safiye, get up. Delete the cheek part. -Get up, get up! -I'm going crazy, I swear! Alright, go to sleep. Go to sleep. God give me patience. The cheek part is too much, but OK. I can kiss him that much, so what? I'm going to kiss you! -Welcome, Şino. -Hello, girls. Why are you here? -Türkan called me. -He will deliver. -Hello. -Hello. -Who is this? -My uncle's son. He came from Ankara. Özgür. See. Just like me. Sure, just like you. Give him the letter. Here. Take it, quick. -Fine. -Come on, come on. I have a present, too. For Muazzez. Your hair will smell nice too. Shampoo. You know... What is this? It makes your hair smell nice. -Why did... -Muazzez. What is this? It smells nice. A man brings something fragrant. In my orchard, to my daughters. The world has come to an end. Why haven't you told your father, dear? Who is that boy? Dad, my sisters did nothing wrong. Sorry? My sisters did nothing wrong. That boy brought that thing to me. But I didn't know. Give me your hands. Give me your hands. Now, tell me. My sisters did nothing wrong. The boy brought that thing to me, but I didn't know. We don't know what it is either. He brought it to you. You two, put your hands down. Put them down. -Do you know that boy? -No, dad. Why did he bring you a present? I don't know. Huh? Why does a stranger bring you a present? I don't know, dad. What is this? Shampoo. What is it? Shampoo. What is it for? It think it's for the hair. I don't know. Why did that boy bring you a present? Who is that boy? I don't know. That was the first time someone gave me a present. And you caught it. Muazzez. Give me some. Wait, let me put some on. That's enough! Feed it to your hair. Move over, let me see. What happened to us? By God, it smells beautiful. But we all look like rats! Really, what happened to us? -Sister, what kind of a present is this? -How am I to know? -Did we put on too much? -You've put on too much. He beat you just because of this paste, dear? Wash it thing off before someone sees us. -I'm first! -Go, go. I'm first! -Mom, put some on my head. -There you go, dear. Mom, me too. -What is this? -What is it? -What is this? -Mom! What is this? God, give me patience. -Hello, everyone. -Hello. Sit down. Hamit. Yes, Mr. Mayor. Come here. Didn't I entrust these flowers to you? What happened to them? What happened to them? It's foaming. -This is foam! -Give me water! It's getting in my mouth. Ayda. My eyes are burning! Girl, what is this? This thing is soap! My eyes burn! It's all because of you, stupid! -Mr. Mayor... -You can't even handle a few flowers! Mr. Mayor. -What? -Your hair, it's a little foamy. Yusuf, what is this? Stop acting like a maniac! My God. Alright, that's enough. Muazzez! Come here. -You scared me. What? -I came to say sorry. I heard your dad beat you because of me. -So? You want me beaten again? -No, I got worried. I'm fine. Good. Did you use it? The shampoo. Look smelly boy, if dad sees you again, he'll kill me. Go away. Can't people be friends in this city? They can't. Now go away. I'll ask something and then go. -Yes? -How do a man and a woman see each other here? They get married. -Right away? -Pretty much! Go away. I don't get it. How could he? Özgür, this is not Ankara. He's her dad. He can beat her whenever he likes. That's not OK, Keşo! Mine beat me last night, for example. Why is that? -I was beating my brother. -Good for you! Hasn't your father ever beat you? He slapped me once. So he beat you. Only once! So you did what caused him to beat you once. If you did it again, he'd beat you again. -Greetings, brothers! -How are you, Servet? Baykuş, two teas for us. Come here, Şino. -My uncle's son, Özgür. -Hello Özgür. -Hello. -Welcome, boys. -Thanks. -If only we met somewhere else. -Why? -People rather talk politics here. You told us to come here. Yes. -You brought it? -Yes. Gently leave it on the table and I'll pick it up. Nice envelope, by the way. Honorable Servet... If you are serious about this... If your family is of the same... It'd be suitable... I send my regards, and kiss your cheeks. Well written, my dear! Şino, I have to ask you something. Ask, brother. Is Türkan how people describe her? -How? -Beautiful? How beautiful? People say, very. More than very. Very, very beautiful. Good. And is Türkan a good person? That matters too. Very good. Not temperamental, is she? No, she's always witty. There are those who are both. She isn't like that, right? No, no. She's always witty. Good. Tell her that we are serious. Tell her to tell Mr. Mayor. I will, Servet. Go buy yourself something, you rascals! Thank you, brother. How much is it? Özgür, it's 20 liras! Let's go to the pastry shop and eat revani! I had a friend in the army, from Muğla. Yakup. I remember him well. One night I told him about our swamp. And he told me about a certain type of poplar. That one tree would draw a quarter ton of water from the soil, and dry out the swamp. And after being discharged, he kindly sent me three saplings. And here is the result. Sir, I meant to tell you the other day, but couldn't. In fact, these are not poplar trees, sir. These are eucalyptus trees. What trees? Eucalyptus trees. They are healing trees. So is their oil, sir. Oil? What's oil doing in a tree? These aren't animals! Sir, in fact, all plants have an amount of oil in them. Is that so? Very well. Very well. They draw the water and make oil, then. Yes. -But these are poplars. -No, eucalyptus. Poplars. The Mayor's poplars. For 30 years. Don't preach me. Yes. Sir, with your permission, I must leave. So you're absorbing the water and making oil. Well done! Hello. The corns have turned green. What? The corns, I said, they're well grown. No, they're not ripe yet. No, I meant the plants themselves. It's early yet for fruit formation. You pick the beans in the vegetative period. You don't go downtown, do you? No, we don't. We can't really see women downtown. Don't get me wrong. It's not that we must... Everyone lives by their own manners. Every place has its own customs and... Right. -Have a nice day. -Have a nice day. Here! -What is it? -They are serious. Tell Mr. Mayor. My God! Şino, is Servet as handsome as in the photo? By God, he's very handsome. Who among the actors does he look like? -Kadir İnanır. -No way! -But his height is a bit... -Short? No, taller than a normal person. -Shorter than Kadir İnanır. -Fine, fine. You're my dearest, Şino! See you. Those were the days. "They'll come to ask for your hand," they said. I had such a headache today. And I still have it to this day. Before even seeing dad? Right, before. I was young, just 14 years old. He says it's a lie, you were older. I was young. But I was tall. Thank God he didn't marry you young! You'd see if he did. He doesn't marry us old either. Ayda, go and ask now. They're waiting for a reply. -Right, once Safiye is done, I'll go. -No, go now, he's calmer. Now is the time. Look, if he says no, don't insist. Promise? Why would he say no? -They didn't vote for your father. -No? -That's what people say. -How so? Voting is confidential. How am I to know! Please, go and tell him. It's henna time, he's in a good mood. Now is the time. You've made a fool of me, I swear. My head is aching. I can't breathe. Get up, get up! My dear one. Get this place together! Your father will scold us! Come on! If you wished If you wished... Attention. If you wished Bravo. It's only you and me who loves the classics, you know that, Safiye? I would be... Sister, you're excited, aren't you? A bit. But I won't expect too much. Maybe he won't let me. He asked Şino about me too! What did he say? "They say Türkan is very beautiful, is that true?" What did Şino say? He said "More than very"! He needn't exaggerate. Right, he has. If only he hasn't done that. Don't worry, dear, it's fine. What if on the wedding day he lifts the veil and says they exaggerated? They live downtown, right? Yes, right in the middle of downtown. You'll finally get to see downtown, Türkan! I hope so! The Sezgin family have sent word. If it's about their treachery in the elections, they shouldn't even bring it up. No, it's not that. What do they want? They're asking for Türkan's hand, for their son Servet. I have no daughter to give a man I don't greet on the street! You didn't say this, and I didn't hear it. -What did he say? -"You didn't say this, and I didn't hear it." -Why? -It's political. There you go. I have to go. -I think there's only one way to do this. -What is it? Osman Ağa. Dad can't turn him down. Nobody can. If he steps in, he'll get this done. But he isn't here. He's in Ankara, Muazzez. I know, Safiye. We have to bring him. If he comes all the way from there to visit dad, he can't say no. Who will bring him? Mr. Groom, of course! We came up with the idea and he'll grab him. Of course! Nobody in this world is smarter than Muazzez! That's why if I went to school, I'd be much better. My dear sister! What a great solution she came up with! So, now what? Safiye, bring a notebook and a pen. Why is that? You'll write another letter. I think it would be much better if you wrote it, Muazzez. I'm sleepy anyway. I'll go to bed. -No. -I swear you're not! -I swear I am! -No, you're not! Get her out! Please, I'll get up early! -Please! -This is the last one! Osman Ağa? Thanks, boys. Well done, Servet. Tip us for good news, but not for the bad! I can't always bring you good news! Right. Is the mailman not paid for delivering bad news? Right! VENDOR Mehmet, how are you? I'm drunk, Şino. No talking, proceed. Proceed. -Thanks, cousin. -Drink poison. -What happens in the highlands? -It's beautiful there. There are girls all around. You play with them, talk to them, eat raisins. Raisins? You can't find fresh grapes in the highlands! Excuse me. Hatip, how are you? Welcome, Şino. This my uncle's son. Özgür. Fresh from Ankara. He's not as handsome as I am, but he's alright. -Hello, nice to meet you, Özgür. -Me too, Hatip. Wonderful. Does the Mayor's family go to the highlands? They are, don't worry. Muazzez is coming too. It's the season, of course. Damn right it is! Tekin, stop here. Stop here, please, Tekin. Tekin, the door... Good day, Safiye. Thank you. Let me help you. No, I can carry them. -No way, I'll carry them. -No, no, I'll carry them. They must be heavy. Let me. Thank you. They really are heavy. Let me take back one of them. No, no. I didn't mean that. I meant, you are strong. You're strong and able. That's great. Yes. Where are you from? -Antalya. -That's where the Mediterranean is, right? -Yes, the Mediterranean is there. -What is it like? -The sea? -Yes. The water is blue. It's big. Does it smell? Of course! What does it smell like? A mix of iodine and salt. It's harder to describe smells than the sea. Thank you. I would like to stop by the highlands. God willing. I hope, one day... Let's see how it is there. Yes. RESERVED FOR OFFICIAL WORK Leader of the Justice Party, Mr. Süleyman Demirel stated that efforts to form a government have not been successful. How can you be successful with those men? A National Front! It's foolish to look for any other solution. The Right has to unite! Demirel has also stated that deaths due to anarchy are on the rise and said "We are losing blood as a nation." That's right. This was the news, brought to you by the TRT news center. Now, light music. Great! The country is going down, and you play light music! The human mind is capable of so many things. Assume that we are all in a room. Our room is tied up on a cable from above. The cables are connected to poles. And our room is floating in the air from one pole to the next. Going the way from this mountain to the next. They call it a cable car. The foreigners have it. We'll build one too. You understand? I don't think you do. What are you doing with that? I'm making butter. Make some and let's eat. Everyone makes their own food here. -So? I'm herding sheep. -With that outfit? -Yes. What's wrong with it? -You're playing games all the time. So you're watching me! Özgür, go away! Don't get fooled by the highlands. No one has ever told me to go away so many times! If you went away the first time I told you, I wouldn't have to! I can't communicate here. -Why not? -I don't speak Kurdish. Shame. And you say you're from here! -Teach me! -I don't know how to teach. I don't even know how to read and write. -I can teach you to read and write! -Go away. He will see us! Go. Go away. My God. When the left side is like that, one feels afraid, of course. Şehmuz! Easy, girl! Şehmuz, let me have the bag as well. The bag... Şehmuz! Şehmuz! Şehmuz! We're going fast. Safiye, take a look. Quick! Türkan. Mr. Engineer. Here, drink some. What happened to me? The highlands. It's high. It happens. -This is a yogurt ayran, right? -Well, of course. Of course, what else? It must be yogurt. I like it a lot. Muazzez! Go! Thank you, it tastes great. Be pure as water... -I meant, ayran. -There's yogurt on your lips. Why do you care about the yogurt on the man's lips! God forgive us. There's yogurt on your lips! Türkan? Dear. Dear, what's wrong with you? Come on, tell me. Far away. I know he will send me away. Perhaps somewhere near Şemdinli. A village of ten houses at most. A prison in the mountains. The roads will be closed for six months in winter. I won't see you anymore. I'll have many kids, and raise them. I'll get fat. My wounds will scab with time. I'll have my secret corner away from everyone. I'll cry there quietly. Poor me, poor you My tall and kind one To us, these highlands are unkind Let's go to the mountains of last spring I wish I was a rose on the hillside Let's put the bells on the goats Let the rams lead the way Let's go greet the chief of Hakkari Etar is coming! Etar is coming! Etar is coming! Thank God, he brought my fabric. Sister, Etar is here! Why should I care? Will I wear silvery fabric as I cry? The letter didn't work. So Osman Ağa didn't agree to come all the way to the Mayor. -Methods matter, Safiye. -Hello. Hi there. -Thank you. -Safiye, can we have a word? Should I go? Follow him. Don't let anyone notice, don't be late. I mean... Antalya is a beautiful city, almost completely surrounded by the sea. You know the ships on the sea? I've always wanted to get on a ship. They have white curtains on them, very pretty. Why did you call me? You... How can I say? -I think of you. -Think? -Yes. -Why? Not for any reason. Reason or no reason, I think of you. But there has to be a reason. Right, so I wrote to my family, "Should I be serious?" Then they can come here. Of course, if Mr. Mayor deems it suitable. And most importantly, if you, too say yes. It's up to my father to decide. Ladies, I've brought all this beautiful fabric from Antep. Show us those silvery ones. I'll make myself a pompous dress just out of spite. That's right! I also have some great news. For those who wonder. Come on, what have you heard? Osman Ağa is ailing. He's in Ankara now. That's why things are going a bit slow. But Servet is very much hooked on you! Just pray that Osman Ağa gets well. May God make him well. God willing. Say amen, girls! Amen! You've heard all there is to be heard, come on. The Mayor will come! The Mayor? So I'll get going. -With your permission. -Take it easy! Next time. Come on. They're getting undressed! Is what we're doing right? I'm not sure any longer. -Sister, you're not coming in? -Yes. -I'll just get my feet wet. -That's all? So did they get undressed now? That's all, what more do you want? I brought the shampoo. Shampoo, my shampoo! Your hair smells beautiful, Muazzez. Who are you? Özgür. Why do you keep scaring me? We have to meet. It's very important. -Özgür... -Come to the waterfall after breakfast. The lessons are starting. Good night. Ew, I've stepped on horse crap. Can you teach me this? I know these pictures by heart. I keep looking at them for years. That girl keeps talking! Read to me what she's says. This photo novel is called "Love Takes Courage." "Love Takes Courage". Nice name. -Is that first word "Love"? -Yes, it's "Love". I thought so. -Shall I read? -Yes. "This dog, an important personality, was named Patsy. And Mariella was its owner." -What's her name? -Mariella. -What kind of name is that? -They might be foreigners. Foreigners? Outlanders. Safiye hasn't once told me that these are outlanders! I'll ask you something. Look. These lines, they mean they are speaking, right? Yes. So, -what are these round ones? -They mean they are thinking. Thinking, but not saying anything, is that so? -Yes. -I thought it was shouting. No, they're thinking. Here it thinks, "What will she do now?" It's not out loud. He's thinking. Shouldn't it be both lines and boxes when they speak? -Why? -One can't speak without thinking. No. There are ones who do, I know a few. -Shall I read it? -Read it. Mariella is arguing with someone here, you see? In a very unexpected place and time, I had finally found my first school. Hello. -I hope I'm not... -Come here, Engineer, sit down. You came just at the right time. I finished it. Watch this. Yusuf. Our folk love to say things won't work out. And when they don't, they're happy because they'd said so. There. What do you think? Beautiful. You built it? I built it. Actually, I will build it. Well thought. Mr. Mayor, there's this thing... Go ahead. It's hard to say it. What if my family came here from Antalya? To speak to you. For a sentimental purpose. Would you be willing to allow it? I would like to ask for Safiye's... Now I understand why you come around our house so often. No, sir... Tell your family not to bother. May I ask, why not, sir? You'd better not. The answer may upset you. So be it. I'd still like to hear it, with your permission. You're a good boy. Well educated. But the daughter of a person like me should join the family of a person like me. Do you think you are like me? Like you? -I don't understand. -Right. You're not like me. If it were me, I'd already have got the question. And the answer, too. I understand. With your permission. OK. Don't act like you've been starving. Sister. What are you doing here, all alone? I know, they'll never let me see that sea. Should I go or should I stay? Go. Where? -Muazzez, go. -Alright. -Start with the simple things. -"Bread" is nan. "Water" is av. That's too simple, I do know those. -If you want to eat meat, say goşt. -Goşt. Good. How to say "I love you"? You don't say that. It's improper. -Is it improper to love? -Of course it is. One can say "I love you" to one's mother. Right. You say "Ez te hezdıkım". Ez te hezdıkım. How about "I miss you"? Min bêriya te kiriye. How do you say "Life without you is hell for me"? That's really hard. How do you say "If you don't give me a kiss, I'll jump off?" You say "in your dreams"! Fine. -This is M. -There. Not that. Look. -What? -Look, there. -It's the same. -It's not. "Luccio looks sideways, into Mariella's eyes. They exchange glances, and their trembling lips meet." What, what? Their trembling lips met. Their lips met? What do you mean? Like that. It's a photo. No trembling here, but it says so. I know this photo by heart already. So why are you asking me? For no reason. -What are you doing? -Luccio looks at Mariella like this. See? "They exchange glances, and their trembling lips meet." Look, my lips aren't trembling. Maybe mine are. Stop it! Read it, read that page! Read it. Just when we were starting to enjoy there, the time of the wind came. Highlands season was over. He's right. I'm not like him. I chose to come here myself anyway. I wanted to know my country. I could pull some wires and go elsewhere. We have many friends. I wrote a petition now. I'll take a leave first. During my leave, I'll be reassigned. "Now I get why you come around our house so often", he said. Why give up? What can I do? I don't know. -But I'm thinking. -Don't think. Both of you, forget about this. For the best. Özgür, where are you going? Cousin! My God. Şino. What does Şino mean, Şino? -They call folks with blue eyes Şino here. -Your eyes aren't blue. They were blue when I was born. The damn things turned brown later on! In the name of God... What's that? Apple orchard. Should I go? Don't be late. "Luccio: 'Let's jump together. If I commit suicide with you, maybe then you'll believe me. So come on, let's jump together.' Mariella: 'But...' Luccio: 'I love you, Mariella.' Mariella: 'I love you too, Luccio.' They finally came together. Neither the past, nor the future mattered any longer. They were happy, and there was no other time but then. The end." What wasn't there? Time. Is it finished? It is. Yes. That was the first and the last kiss of my life. And we were up on a tree. What's wrong with that? Doesn't everyone elope here? Poor men elope with other poor men's daughters. -Nobody elopes with the Mayor's daughter! -OK! So what do you say? What do you say, Hatip? Your thoughts matter the most. I don't really know. Would Safiye accept? If she did... And I haven't slept for days, so... -They won't come anyway. -That's their problem. OK, Hatip? Agreed? Are you in? Agreed. -I don't agree. Just so you know. -We do know, Şino. Come, brother. It went as I expected. Osman Ağa came to our house. Our letters took a long time to write, but they worked. It's a pleasure to have you here. They said you were ill, Osman Ağa, but you're like an ox! Thank God. Congratulations. He gave his blessing! Yes. I tried for years, but you didn't take to grafting. You were born a rebel, you will die a rebel. Welcome, Mr. Engineer. Thanks, sir. I've been reassigned to Antalya. I came to say goodbye. Let me kiss your hand. Really? You came right on time. Say goodbye to this friend. Yusuf. It's the last sour apple tree, sir! Let it live. You've tamed them all, let just one stay a rebel! It shouldn't have opposed me. Hello. I'm leaving. I got one sour apple sapling, as a souvenir from you. I mean, as a souvenir of the years I spent here. We're leaving, Özgür and me. Who knows, maybe we'll leave together, all four of us. Four of us. "We're leaving in two days. We got four bus tickets. Two for us, two for you. If that day, you wear your veils and take your seats on the bus, we can get away from here together. Think well. Your loved ones. Özgür and Hatip." Have they gone mad? It's all good for you, isn't it? You're already set. Now they'll send me to Şemdinli. Hear what you say. I want your happiness more than my own! I raised you! No manners at all. Over there, the Mediterranean, orange trees two houses, side by side. Maybe you and Servet will move there later, too. Think! All three of us. We can live by the sea. Wouldn't it be nice? -Don't forget the ships. -Of course! We'll get on ships all the time! Don't be crazy. Dad will get you caught, and you know what he'll do then. You'll put us all to shame. So what shall we do? You'll sit at home. We couldn't have left. We couldn't do that to you, or to Türkan. Or we were just afraid to. We couldn't do it. What was the name of our photo novel? Dad. Dad. "Love Takes Courage." Goodbye. When your older sister gets married, two people seem to leave. Your sister, and one of your mothers. If you watched it on TV last night, Mr. Prime Minister and Mr. Demirel put it very well. What did he say? He said "They haven't nailed a single nail for this country." Is that not true? -It's true. -What have they done? They haven't done anything for the people. We built the dams. We built the bridges. We built the roads and the hospitals. So, why did we lose the election? If we were so sweet, why did we lose? Why? -Because of our own mistakes. -Right! What did we do? We took victory for granted. We didn't prepare. And on a snowy day, Osman Ağa came to our house again. This time for my sister, Safiye. At least, he's an ağa. They live downtown. In the room where we grew up together, I was now on my own. In other words, Mariella was devastated. -In the name... -I have one condition. A condition? What is it? You have five brothers. You have such a large family. I want a separate house. That's all done. I'm almost done arranging the house, Safiye. But the house I want isn't here. Not here? -No. -Where is it? In Antalya. -Where? -Promise me. -Safiye, we can't go and... -Promise me. -Cevdet, promise me. -I promise. Don't forget, -you promised. -Alright, I did. Muazzez. -When are you leaving? -In three days. -I hope you pass the exam. -That'll be the day! -You'll see Ankara, at least. -You're right. You have anything to say? -To whom? -To Özgür, of course. This way. It's right there on the left. This way. Thank you. -How will we find a hundred workers? -We will. Özgür. -Are we going ahead with the food boycott? -Of course we are! Cousin. Şino. THE YOUTH WANTS REVOLUTION, NOT REFORMS I came for the university exam. I'll go back tomorrow. Choose this school. You can join the struggle with us. That's the easy part if they accept me here. It's not easy at all, Şino. There's fighting every day. We see, on the news. Any news from our hometown? -I have a letter for you. -From whom? Who do you think? Thank her for me. -What else is up? -Thank her for you? Is that all? You were just about to elope, Özgür! Şino, I think you don't understand me. The revolution is days, weeks, months away! Everyone is just waiting for a spark! -So? -So, do you think I'll have time for love? We're all historically responsible! Özgür. Don't get too caught up. Don't neglect your studies. Don't worry, cousin. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Dear Özgür Düler. When you left, I found out that it's so hard to be without you. I'll be waiting for you. You'll be back, I know. How was the exam, Şino? I didn't even understand the questions! Nobody had such high hopes of you anyway. That's right. So? What else is up there? I gave him your letter. -So? -So, he sent you his greetings. -What do you mean? -The universities are like a battleground. It's like the Armageddon. Photos, posters everywhere, fighting... -Why? What's going on there? -According to Özgür, it's a revolution. -What is revolution? -I don't know either. See you. Mariella was standing aghast not knowing what... What to do. In fact, I don't really want to tell you these parts, dad. But, well... There are three suitors for Muazzez. Two of them are poor. No need to dwell on them. The third is serious. Who is it? Osman Ağa's nephew, -Hurşit. -Hurşit? He took one to his son, and now he wants one for his nephew? The girl is getting older. At this rate, there won't even be any nephews left for Muazzez. Don't say I didn't warn you. Our dinner table was still plentiful and crowded. But in fact, all we had left was your retirement pension and our house. When you let Meryem and Besme go, all the housework was left on mom and me. Your departure ended us. We're very busy, too. I don't rest for a second. I counted yesterday. There were 24 people at Osman Ağa's house. I counted again after the visitors left. There were still 18 people. It's us who are done for, Muazzez. I have a bigger problem. As I'm the older sister, I suppose. What's wrong? I'm pregnant. -Pregnant? -That's great. That's great news! Why are you so sad about that, crazy! What's wrong? Servet drinks whenever he has the chance. He stares at rakı bottles. Oh, no! I'm becoming an aunt! I wasn't ready, dear! I'm too young for it. If Muazzez leaves too, who will look after this place? Will you do all that work alone? She won't stay forever. We'll get her married in the end. Let's not be late, the suitors will get worse. I think there's only one solution. What is it? Muazzez gets married and I get married too. You want to get a second wife, Aziz? Only if you agree. What? Will you accept it? -For you. -I don't accept it! -I don't want to get married anyway. -Just look at dad, what plans he's made for himself! He must have already found the girl to marry! Think carefully! This is not something to laugh about. We're not laughing because it's funny, but because it's wrong. Mom, go and tell him, "Muazzez refuses, and so do I." You say that like I object to your father every day! -Just once. -Do you want Muazzez to go unmarried? My father has retired. Don't feed freeloaders every night! Retired, you say? He still has his eye on becoming mayor. This crowd is here to stay, then. Mom. Mom, I don't want to get married. Just look at those two! It's not all that bad. Watch your words! That's not what I meant. No manners. Give me some water. I'm fine. Drink it. Give it. Mayor. If I don't accept a second wife, will you still get one? No. I won't. Then, I don't accept. -And Muazzez? -She doesn't either. Fine. Your choice. Ayda. What'd you say if I had said otherwise? Are these mountains a curse for us? Or are they wonders of nature? Are these mountains obstacles that prevent roads and supplies from coming here or gifts from our God to us? My esteemed townsmen, these mountains are both our trouble and our way forward. What is the way forward? Tourism. What is the way? What is the way? The cable car. I've been hearing that there's some mocking talk going around in some quarters about this issue. I have only one thing to say to those people. Those who can dream of only today, cannot possess the future! As you have heard in radio and television news both, all existing political parties have been abolished as of today. The situation and reasons that have forced National Security Council to take these decisions, can be explained as follows. The situation our country has been in since before September 12, 1980... They took him from his house at dawn. My aunt was so scared that she went mute. Then what? Then she just recovered, without seeing a doctor. Where did they take Özgür, Şino? God knows. They took him to prison, of course. I told him many times. Not to get so much involved. My dear one. Cevdet, I swear, I'll get up tomorrow get on a bus, and go to Antalya. And I'll take her with me. Come with us, or don't. Good evening, my esteemed citizens. When I looked at the calendar, I was happy to see that since 6 November 1983... Don't go, I need you You are the light in my eyes The crown on my head, I need you Around 21:30 last night, Şemdinli, in Hakkari, and Eruh, in Siirt, were attacked by groups of rebels. At the attack on a military lodging building, Private Süleyman Aydın was martyred. The authorities have stated that a large scale operation was launched in the area and that the rebels will be caught and brought to justice as soon as possible. This was the news. Now, the weather report. By the department of navigational hydrography and oceanography. The fighting that began in those days would soon come all the way to our neighborhood. And nothing would ever be the same again. Aziz, of course we do have you in mind for the next term. I would never want you to resent. And the last thing our leader would want... We can arrange the house and everything, dad. Just decide to come. Come to Antalya, dad. It's like heaven here. Thank you. Goodbye. Safiye's passion for the sea and the town's fate gave rise to a migration to Antalya. First one home, and then another. And then the third. And finally it was our turn. Cevdet, they're here! -How are you, Safiye? -Thank God. Come over here! -Are these from downtown? -All around is downtown! Cevdet, pull it over there. Looks good. LEGUMES It's all shampoo? They are! He was a noble man and he had a beautiful horse. Rıza... Şakit... Şakit Ağa. They came early one morning. No, it was the night... The evening. Ayda, was that gathering in the Zengil highlands or around Koçağız? Who? I've been mixing up places. This place isn't treating me well. Mayor, look, our visitors are here with a good purpose. Is that so? Let's hear them. Mr. Mayor, like Muazzez, our son Cengiz didn't get married in time. We sent him to his military service. He finished it. And for three years, he's been rather well off. What does he do? I have a tea shop at the Esforan office building. And I make very good money. Mr. Mayor, we are asking for your daughter Muazzez's hand. They are both getting late to marry. Let's get this done. Ayda says I'm a tough man. A man of bitter words. She says people are afraid to talk to me. Therefore, I will spare you such bitter words now. Instead, I will quietly leave this meeting. I'll be back. Once you have left. Zakir! Zakir Ağa. Of course, it was Zakir Ağa. And he had a beautiful voice. He sang... You know that one? Zakit Ağa. I remember the old times as I forget the present. "A very important personality..." -Auntie! -Auntie! -My dear! -You're so tall! -I missed you so much! -You're so tall! Come here! -You have a moustache? -A bit. -So you're a real man now! -He is using razors! -Where is mom? -She's sleeping. Where is Servet? Down in hell! You're getting your medicine? I do, but I can't breathe. My dear mother. My dear. Give it here. Mom's drinking coke? For a year. In the name of God. It relieves my throat, Türkan. I can't breathe. I swear. This is over. I'm not going back again. I'll divorce him. You'll divorce him? You'll be the first person to do so in our history. What would dad say? How has he been lately? Does he remember things? It comes and goes. Fine, then, he won't say anything. Even if he did, he'd forget it. It's best to forget anyway. It's not all that bad, but still... Are the swamps a punishment? Where to? To the municipality, of course. Thank you, Yusuf, thanks. Sir, you didn't pay! Sir? Sir, you didn't pay! -Pay for what? -The cab fare. Who do you want to see, sir? -Who are you? -Security guard. Fine. And I'm the Mayor. -Sir? -Sir, you haven't paid! -Sir, who are you looking for? -Get your hands off me. If you tell me, I can try to help you. I'm the Mayor! Get off me, you fool! Sir, you're not the Mayor. -Get out of my way! -Sir! -Hey! -Get out of my way! -Calm down, sir! -Get out! It's fine! Let him go. Mithat, it's fine. I know the gentleman. Friends, it's fine. Get back to work. Mr. Mayor. What are you doing here? Who are you? I'm Hatip. Don't you remember me? The agricultural engineer. This is not my municipality. What is this place? That girl... That girl... Muazzez. Where is Muazzez? Let me take you to Muazzez, Mr. Mayor. This is not my municipality. I lit up fires on mountains many nights I sat there and dreamed. This is where I had picked him up. Thank you. Mr. Mayor. Here, Mr. Mayor. Dad! Dad! Sir, bring him here please. -Over here. -Where have you gone? -Third floor, tell him. -It's the third floor, come in. Bring him, sir. May God bless you. Why did you get out on your own? Why didn't you tell us? You're getting us in a lot of trouble, dad. Hatip, the engineer? Hello, Muazzez. Come in, please. I haven't seen Ayda around. I hope she's fine. She's ill. She's sleeping now. -May she recover. -Thank you. What do you do now? I'm the Director of Parks and Gardens. Director of the park? We go there with dad. Is that your place? No, I don't own it, but I take care of it. I'm responsible for it. -Any children? -I'm married. Two children. -A boy and a girl. -God bless them. -Amen, God bless all our children. -Amen. -Where is dad? -He's sleeping. -How is he? -He's fine, he's inside. -Welcome, Hatip. -Thanks, Safiye. Welcome to Antalya. Thanks. Thank you for helping my father. That's alright. Don't mention it. A coincidence. A coincidence. So you've finally seen it. Sorry? The sea, I mean, you saw it. Yes, I did. Thank God. We often go for a picnic there. With the kids. So he was found? Welcome. May God bless you, sir. Thank you. May God bless all of us. -Welcome. -Thank you. -Where is Mr. Mayor? Is he fine? -He's fine, he's sleeping. That's good. See, there's still hope for humanity! -That's alright. -I mean it. Hatip, let me introduce you. Cevdet, my husband. -Is that so? -Oh, yes. -Nice to meet you. -You, too. I told you, Mom is ill. You don't understand? Get sober first, and then we'll speak! God damn you! Sorry to hear. -What is the problem? -Difficulty in breathing due to goiter, and... What I don't understand is, her lungs are as bad as a miner's. What did she do? She baked bread. Muazzez. Yes, Ayda. Do you give me your blessing? Where did you get that? Of course, I do, mother. I don't give myself my blessing. Why not? I wish when he asked for a second wife I hadn't listened to you, and had said yes. Ayda, there is someone I love. I'm waiting for him. The second wife or not. Dad could send me away if he wanted to. Who? Who is it? Özgür. That boy with nice smelling hair? Yes. That boy with nice smelling hair. Where is he now? I don't know. Muazzez, give me some of that black water. Black water? The doctor forbid it. Muazzez. -How can I find black water here anyway? -Look in the fridge. Good. Lift my head up. In the name of God. Thank you. Put that back on. Alright. Mother! Mom, where have you gone? Why did you leave us alone? Where did you go? Graveyards are better than hospitals. At least they are green. Come on, I can't sing it at all. When you forgot everything, we became such good friends, didn't we, dad? And when my mother was gone too, you and I were left alone. I've been speaking for so long. Tell me, what do you remember? My name is... My name is Aziz. Aziz Özay. I'm the Mayor. I'm the Mayor. Well done! Well done, dad! Wait. I'm the Mayor. Şenay! Here, please. Dad! Dad is here. Come here, dear. -Welcome. -Thanks, dear. Hello. Let me introduce you, Muazzez. Mr. Mayor. Kiss his hand, Nil. Ali, you too. Hello. God bless your children. Şenay, bring the coffee to the back. Let's serve the coffee at the back. Okay. Mr. Mayor, let's go over here. Slowly. Right there. Let him sit down. Mr. Mayor, do you see that tree over there? Look. It's from your orchard. Those are sour apples. Muazzez, would you like to taste them? Me? Of course, I would. -Have one. -Fine. Özgür, it's you. And you are you. -I'm taking one. -That's right! Just ask. No need to be a thief. They finally met. Neither the past, nor the future mattered any longer. They were happy, and there was no other time but then. The end. What wasn't there? Time.
