Heiwa Ōhashi (Peace Bridge), Heiwa Kaikan (Peace Hall), Heiwa Ōdori (Peace Boulevard). In this boulevard, stands the very famous Sadao Maruyama's Memorial stele for the victims of atomic bomb. Near the epicenter, the remains of the Industrial Promotion Hall. Now It's hosting sparrows, doves and other wild birds. This is the story of a woman encountered by our film crew. At that time, I and my husband wandered around the city, sadly looking for our lost child. So we met on the street those people with little children. They were imploring us saying: "Give me some water!" They were hopeless, they just wanted some water. There was no way we could help them. They were dying one by one... A mother hugged her son, and the burned skin started to hang down. Red Cross Hospital at that time. Hair loss and bleeding from the gums, persistent diarrhea. Even physicians didn't know what to do. Patients breathed their last one by one. A human shadow etched in stone. Someone who rested here for a while. Suddenly, he melted by the heat ray of 5000°C. Hiroshima Gokoku Shrine Ten years have passed, today's Hiroshima is crowded by coin laundries and cabarets. Occasionally, the scar raises up, in other words, when a keloid girl is seen, people don't care, they're busy with their lives. Also the human shadow etched in stone, now got fainter and it almost disappeared. The flow of time will erase all memories they say. Well, the Red Cross Hospital has also been completely renovated, except for the memorial tower in one corner. There are no more traces of such tragedy. But, on the other hand, as soon as we enter in hospitals or homes in backstreet, the flow of time can't fade the fallout. Facing the great destruction of the A-bomb the crew was horrified. A mother watching over her son with acute leukemia. According to our results, acute leukemia is extremely lethal. First, there's no way to fully recover. Escaping death is the real problem. That's because at this moment there aren't many effective drugs. Here we are using this one combined with blood transfusion and finally we get some results. Here is a person affected by leukemia and is fighting for life. While working at the market in front of Hiroshima Station, this wife is serving a bedridden husband. Our family fortune is almost gone, but in return, It saved your life, I'm grateful. Even if you sleep all the time, you are still alive, and that's enough for me. It is painful to die. Now a leukemia patient is dead. Hamashiro, a farmer of the suburbs of Hiroshima. He wasn't directly related to the atomic bomb. He came to Hiroshima to undertake a job one week later. He slept outside for two nights. Ten years later, the older brother regrets: "He ended up like this!" Many people affected by exposure of atomic bomb had similar situations, We can't imagine how worrying it is. Hamashiro's corpse is carried to the dissection room. RADIO: "According to Chūgoku Shinbun..." Grandfather brought up all by himself these brothers who lost their parents due to the atomic bomb. Certificate of commendation "... Second news:" "Today at 14:30, at the Red Cross Hospital, the fourth person died from A-bomb disease this year. He was a farmer from Toyota District, Hiroshima. at the age of 30. Name of disease: acute myeloid leukemia. He got ill last fall and hospitalized in Dec. Since that, his situation continued to worsen, with persistent bleeding from gums, the number of leukocytes in..." After Hamashiro's death news, The grandfather suddenly became anxious. He is very worried about the spots that sometimes appear on his hands. Until grandchildren become independent, he feels like he can't die. Hamashiro's mother welcomes her son who is now dead and cold. She said: "Welcome, welcome back!" She was stuck to the coffin. After only two weeks, Hamashiro's old brother took part in street fundraising with other A-bomb survivors. A-bomb survivors‘ petition for National Security ... we ought not remain silent! Bikini, Enewetak Atoll and the Marshall islands are peaceful countries, we must protest at all costs against nuclear testing! Atomic dust. We tried to place the atomic dust on a photographic plate. The near-death Kuboyama, Kuboyama's wife, The wife and her mother. Items from A-bomb ruins National relief for A-bomb survivors 1 Yen Donation Also in Nagasaki, the terror of the atomic bomb is the same. A 13-year-old boy didn't notice anything himself, he was happily going to school... After a medical examination, he was diagnosed with leukemia. Child's parents died by explosion, and now his grandmother is raising him. The total number of leukocytes is 388'000. It’s about 50 times more than a normal person. Erythrocytes are also not too good. Almost half of a normal person. I can't really give any prospect for this boy. But it’s a critical situation. Because he doesn't want to fall behind in class, He said: "I want to go to school soon!" The dogs used in experiments torment the hospital. This little 14-year-old girl has been suffering from thoracic empyema for 10 years. ... bronchiolitis and thoracic empyema seem to be connected. As for now, that empyema is leaking out from trachea and then from mouth. It can't be healed without surgery. But I don't know if her body can endure surgery. This girl's mother is working as day laborer. I don't grudge the atomic bomb, I believe we should just pray to the Virgin Mary. It is painful to die. But... it is also painful to live. Nagata was exposed to the bomb in July, He was hit from the top of his head to the tip of his toes. When he was a kid, he always had a hard time. They called me "baldie" or "fritter". I was giving up... However, Nagata's most painful memory was when after graduating from middle school, in an employment exam for a company. He was rejected due to the head injury. Nagata was encouraged by his older sister to undergo a plastic surgery. While cutting with a scalpel, Gradually they stretched the skin of the hairy part of the head. This is a way to treat the bald part. One or two more times and It will be much better. - How is your hand? - It's good. The skin from thigh is grafted on the damaged hand. Okay, I think it's good. Today it's enough. There is a small bath in A-bomb survivors' Assoc. office. For women with keloids on their bodies, It's a lovely and safe place. They were denied access to the city's public bath, for making other guests uncomfortable. Here is heaven, so to speak. She's finally out! The evacuation center suddenly became an orphanage. The director of the institution... who founded it and got these children together, He told us: It was a long time ago, we did a fire drill. That time he asked the kids to evacuate with the things most important to them. What we usually think as the most important thing for a child is kimono, clothes, or school textbooks are also important. Food is important. Anyone would bring such things. But it's just people's expectation. The gathered kids won't bring such things. Children gathered... and brought photos of their parents. From now on, what they are looking for are essentially their parents. All their efforts are for parents. Without big dreams like a normal child. A junior high school student who wants to become a barber when he grows up. A girl who wants to be a dressmaker. Living quietly. Thanks to the help of her mother, a keloid daughter had three plastic surgeries. The keloid that should have disappeared is still there, after cutting it the keloid grows back. After a few days, it was cut off again. But the keloid has not healed. I had given up on my face until recently. Before going to work in the morning, mother's feelings while hiding the wound on her daughter's hands. ... Don't look at me! You try to stand still biting your lips and looking down. Weeping in the crowd's insolent stare. Instantly a flash leaps in my mind like a spirit! Oh, that day... ― "Hiroshima Poems" Despite having a beautiful face marked atrociously, she is studying to create a more beautiful design. Fukada was doing business in Shanghai, but... during the visit to the ancestors' tomb to thank for the achievements, he was irradiated at Hiroshima station. A recent test found that the amount of leukocytes were 44,000. For average person it is about 7,000 to 8,000. Eosinophilic leukemia was diagnosed, and he's under treatment now. For more than ten minutes he was critical. He got transfusions from his wife and children so he endured it. I also peddled soap... But it wasn't enough to raise four children. Outside Nagasaki, she's renting a barn from an acquaintance. We didn't have a place to go, now I'm very much obliged. Since we finally moved here, things have become strained. It takes about 2000 or 3000 yen to get electricity. But I can't afford it. I'm using the old lamps in the house. But it's dangerous, They can't be used that long. My children are in trouble for studying, their grades dropped, I really have to do something... I'm 53 now, If I die these three people... I won't leave them alone... In my opinion, At first I thought it didn't matter if I had a child. I couldn't do a little more... Those three people moved here, I afflicted them with my illness... If I were to die now, I would feel sorry for my children. Somehow, my children's future... I hope they could go to school, but I'm unable. Nothing but death awaits me. He's really happy to go to the hospital. Because he can meet his father and eat at the hospital. To save on bus fee, he walks halfway and then gets on the bus. Hospital cleaners, Yamaguchi and old women bring the leftover food. I want to fill their stomach with rice to make some progress. I couldn't forget when A-bomb survivors, despite their difficult times, they helped me. That's why I bring food to these three children. I said: "Give it to them!" One day, Fukada confided to Yamaguchi that he considered family suicide. He said that it's better to die than to suffer so much. I understand that it's painful, even so we've survived the atomic bomb. And we are still alive. Like a person condemned to death, don't give up and cheer up a little more! I encouraged him: "Let's live!" Every Saturday, they sleep near their father. However, Fukada can't fall asleep on such a night. It is painful to die and to live. But It's good to live. Yamaguchi was squashed by the steel frame of the factory. Plastic surgeries didn't succeed so far. Next, a representative of A-bomb survivors of Nagasaki and delegate of "A-bomb Maidens" Assoc. Please come to the stage, Misako Yamaguchi. I was in Nagasaki when I was 15 years old. I was exposed to atomic bomb and suffering big injury. I was in hospital for 7 months, I came back home and there was no house, My mother, my father, my sister and my brother... all died in the atomic bomb. I was the only person left to rely on. This painful long rush of the last ten years, I hope you will understand... Everyone in this gathering, Please don't ever drop... that horrible thing all over the earth again! Due to the atomic bomb in Nagasaki, there are people that have lost their own house, spending the last ten years living with their mothers. If their mothers would die tomorrow, how could they live from that moment? When they think about it, they prefer to die in the meantime. But even if we die now... who will protect the world from that horrifying thing that is A-bomb? I went to the "August 6th convention" and came back to Nagasaki. I'm very, very glad... Because we have so many people by our side, Let's cheer up and live from now on! No parents and no providence, Hiroshima Meiseien, where blind orphans are educated. Two keloid childcare teachers are working here. Even without memories of their parents. These five blind children, stay with the music box all day long. Helping a student at painting lesson. Before we gave up on the woman on the right. I realized that even someone like me, it's important for these children. I have gained confidence to live. It is as if... such unfortunate children have saved us. This is what the childcare teacher told us. What did you draw here? It's a sky, that's getting dark. One day, they went to picnic. Even if they can't see, they enjoyed it a lot. Please, start feeding yourself soon. It's difficult to depend on the care of others when you grow up. She made them live in this way. To participate in the school speech contest, Kyoko Fukutomi, a blind girl, is practicing her speech: "When the atomic bomb dropped, I was 4 years old. I was with a friend, playing with a doll. As soon as it exploded, I was buried in a soil wall. I was saved because my mother dug me out. My house was burned. So my mother and I took refuge in a dry riverbed. Many injured people were groaning. That night, we slept outside there. The next morning, when you woke up, in that moment, I said while crying: "I'm blind!" My eyes became blind in the night when I was sleeping. When the sun rose in the morning, my eyes were dark. Since then, my eyelid is closed tightly. It never opened again. I forgot all the things I've seen, but I remember only one, Only the mole under my mother's mouth. At now, I go to a school for the blind learning koto. When I grow up, I will become a koto teacher. I want to live happily with my mother. Also... because in the world, there are very good scientists and politicians. I would like to meet them and... ask them not to create something... like the atomic bomb." Ten years without parents were really painful. This child who still sleeps with the ashes of her parents on the bedside. She grew up well and she holds the office now. These orphans from the A-bomb are meeting together. Their favorite song is: The song of happiness. Happiness is our wish The work is very hard and we work hard putting our future into it To create a bright society Let's sing together The song of happiness Let's follow the spreading echos... At "Nagasaki A-bomb Maidens" Assoc. in order to be autonomous, they devote themself on the knitting workshop. Hirata was pinned under her house. Fractures and right eye damaged. She has been bedridden for ten years. Her father is worrying about his child, and is doing his best. A-bomb affects the body exhausting it. Now, a long winter is about to leave from Hirata's sickroom. Nowadays she is fascinated by red rose bud. Because "Hiroshima Council against A and H Bombs" sent a brace to Hirata, She started walking training. Old friends from Girls' High School encouraged Hirata. Keloid mother who knew the joy of living. When my husband said he was going to get me for the rest of my life, whatever happens. I was really terrified. Even if everyone reassured me, I thought it was better for me to not get married. After all, I think that the strongest among us is my husband. Watanabe was squashed by the steel frame of the factory at the age of 16. Because of fractures with nerve damage, she lost the sensitivity in legs. She was hospitalized once, but... They told me that it's like I don't have a waist. Well, after being cured from bedsore, I came back home, I haven't been out for ten years since then. I was born in Nagasaki and grew up in Nagasaki. But I ignore how is Nagasaki now. Last year, "August 6th convention" was the sunshine of Watanabe's mind. - Yeah, there was the convention. Thanks to that event, I knew that there is a deep interest in the A-bomb survivors. Before that, I lived with the idea that society was coldhearted. [Hiroshima, 10th Remembrance Day] However, at that time, I truly reflected on it for the first time. I usually get up around 7 in the morning. I eat breakfast, and I wash my face. I start working around 7:30. I stand for about 3 hours using the machine. Then, I lie on stomach for 3 hours. I patch together by hands and again upright for 3 hours. After that, I lie down for 3 hours and then I get up again for 3 hours. Then it's like this until 12 PM. I rest around 12:30 PM. Her mother is running a small wooden sandals shop, She sends her youngest son to university. Watanabe is helping with her brother's university expenses. She wants to help her mother who lost her husband and the eldest son due to A-bomb. Thanks to my mother's care, I have lived these ten years. And now thanks to my job, I can live the life I wanted. I will never forget it. But... for whom I have to continue living like this? Today's broadcast will end soon. Have a good evening. Now, Watanabe is going out for the first time in ten years. She was born in Nagasaki and grew up in Nagasaki. She lamented that she didn't know Nagasaki. Our crew were moved by Watanabe's words. We ask to Atomic Bomb Council to let Watanabe's long-standing dream come true. This is Tsukimachi district... - People have more free time. - Also here another cinema? Watanabe, who only knew wartime clothes' days, she was just astonished. Atomic bomb epicenter stele: 500m above ground Ah, they built a monument here! It's not very pretty. - It's beautiful. - What a mighty statue. Is this the Urakami Cathedral? Both towers are gone. That's what happened. There were bells on both of them. One drop over there. A shrine where one of the gate's pillars was blown away by the explosion. Maidens of Peace's Monument "Since the day of the A-bomb, they have risen to heaven while praying for world peace, in memory of the maidens of Jōsei Practical Girl's School." Mitsubishi Electric Factory where Watanabe was on that day. - I was in the main building. - The main building is beautiful again! I wish I had been in another building at that time. It collapsed thunderously! Over there he died. The place where her brother died. Anyway, it was tall, and now it's all flat. The other side collapsed first, but still... I'm not sure... He was there. He was just over there. I lost all hope. The body was found after two months. We are a sort of assurance. In my personal opinion, there is no need to create such a culture. We stopped in front of Senji Yamaguchi's shop, a "A-bomb young survivors" member. He was talking about it when he went to Tokyo recently, to make a petition against Atomic and Hydrogen bombs in favor of A-bomb survivors' National security. A-bomb survivors' congress petition group. We, the survivors, our cry from the heart is, of course, to entirely restore our bodies to our original shape. But before that, we all together don't want that such a tragedy could happen again anywhere in the world. Watanabe was very much happy. The weather was good today. It's so beautiful. Their city was burned and their husbands were robbed. And despite their faces were marked, old ladies day laborer continue to work silently, to turn the epicenter into a beautiful park. The atomic bomb fell around 11:02, that day, around 7 PM, they say that another bomb was dropped on Urakami Cathedral. Then Catholics started to blame the Cathedral itself. All survived believers said that If God exists, then he won't allow another bomb to be dropped on the church. That's the proof that God doesn't exist. At the time of the atomic bomb, no one went to the church. Now I started to believe in God again, After the bomb I couldn't really believe in God. This world was like hell on the earth. First the 26 Martyrs' execution, those who until the end, didn't succumb to the limitless religious persecution. Urakami believers were temporary wavered by the atomic bomb. A girl waiting for her mother day laborer. The mother of this girl... made a model of clay of her child hand, It was exhibited at the A-Bomb Memorial Museum. "You have no sense of shame!" She received furious dissent from relatives and acquaintances. But the mother decided to exhibit it anyway. This person has a strong faith. Human can never fully comprehend God. This mother's wish is to show her daughter's hand to mothers all over the world. The rice is ready! Damage caused by the atomic bomb It's a terrible thing that it had to happen. This mother in particular who transforms misfortune into happiness. She is a Japanese mother with wonderful wisdom. It's good to live THE END Subtitles by Rocchio
