[horn honking] [Hicks] God, please help me. I'm so tired. I need my sleep, I make no bones about it. I need eight hours a day, and about ten at night, and I'm good. But I'm so tired of traveling, I'm so sick of sitting in airport terminals, sitting on runways, in planes that won't take off. Every time I see a hijacking on the news now, I just think to myself, "Do it, do it, do it, go for it. I understand, I'm behind you 100 percent, 'cause I have thought about doing that." Putting a gun to that pilot's head and saying, "This is a hijacking, now you get this motherfucking plane off the ground now." "Where do you want to go? Cuba, Libya, Palestine? No?" "I just wanna go where this plane was supposed to be five hours ago! That's right, I'm hijacking this plane to Nashville." What a bummer, at the end of all these hours of waiting, that my ultimate destination is towns as Nashville or Baton Rouge. I feel like a UFO, because just like UFOs, I too am appearing in obscure Southern towns in front of handfuls of hillbillies. And just like UFOs, these hillbillies find me equally incomprehensible. [announcer] How about a nice round of applause for Mr. Bill Hicks. - [crowd cheering] - Give another hand for Jimmy Pineapple, John Farnetti, and Jammer Bicks. Let's let them here it. Come on! - [applause, cheering] - Come on! Yeah. It's good to be here. I haven't been here in two years. Thanks. That warmth I've missed in Austin. "So? We've been here. It's not our fault you gotta travel around. Shit. We supposed to follow you around? You supposed to be back here. What are you doing? Where are you?" Were have I been? I've been on my "Flying Saucer tour. Which means like flying saucers, I too have been appearing in small Southern towns in front of a handful of hillbillies lately. No one doubts my existence. I've noticed a certain anti-intellectualism going around this country, man, ever since around 1980. Coincidentally, enough. I was in Nashville, Tennessee last week, and after the show I went to a Waffle House. Right? I'm sitting there eating and I'm reading a book, I don't know anybody, I'm alone. I'm eating and I'm reading a book. And this waitress comes over to me, "What you reading for?" Wow, I've never been asked that. Not what am I reading, but what am I reading for? Well, goddamn it, you stumped me. I guess I read for a lot of reasons, but the main one is so I don't end up being a fucking waffle waitress. Yeah. That'd be real high on the list. Then this truck driver at the next booth gets up, stands over me and goes, "Well, looks like we got ourselves a reader." What the fuck's going on? Like I walked into a Klan rally in a Boy George costume or something. Am I stepping out of some intellectual closet here? I read, there I said it. I feel better. Some serious humanity, man, serious pockets of humanity out there. Go to some of these truck stops in the middle of nowhere, meet some serious folk, man. Order a coffee, the guy behind the counter goes, "You want the 32 ounce or the large?" Shit, how big is that large? "You going want to pull your car around back. I'm going to start that pump." [laughs] [mic stand rattling] That sounds like a lot of fucking coffee, dude. I'm... I don't know if I want to be awake that long in Tennessee, you know? Just... on second thought... ...give me that pussy size. Saw a sign by the road in Tennessee once, it said, "Dirt for sale." What a great country we live in. Huh? Dirt... for sale. How'd you like to get inside that guy's mind and look around for an hour, huh? Guy sees the opportunity at every glance, doesn't he? This is a big world for this gentleman. "Oh, my God. Honey! Honey, quit serving waffles and come here, baby. I'm gonna sell dirt! Look, it's everywhere. You need for a planet. Honey!" The place was called Land Land. Hm... You ever see that sign-- this is a great sign, the one that says "Speed limit enforced by aircraft"? Wow! Man, you get pulled over by a plane... ...you're gonna have a time talking your way out of that ticket. "You know how fast you were going, son?" "Uh, 70?" "You were going 300 miles an hour, buddy. What the hell are you doing?" "Sorry, sir, I had this large coffee back at that truck stop. [laughs] I'm fucking flying! Huge coffee! I bought some dirt, I thought that'd slow me down, but no. Biggest motherfucking coffee I ever seen. He pumped it right up my nose. I'm just skin covering coffee right now. And some real nervous teeth." [snorts] Tennessee. Boy, you know, in many parts of our troubled world, people are yelling, "Revolution, revolution." In Tennessee they're yelling, "Evolution." "We want our thumbs!" The thing is they see people with thumbs on TV all day, boy, that's gonna drive them hog wild, huh? [hooting] Trailers are shaking. - Hate that point... - [woman] Yes! They're nice people, they're just, what would you call them? Rural? Backwoods? Country? They're real nice, man. After the show, one of these guys came up to me, "Hey! You're great, you're cracking me up. I was about to spit." "Sorry." He said, "No, I loved it. I'd like you to meet my wife and sister." And there was one girl standing there. Not a thumb between them. Goddamn it! What are the odds of that? Okay, the girl had a little nubben growing out. But the girls evolve quicker than guys. That's... [woman] Whoo! ♪ John is in the basement mixing up the medicine ♪ ♪ I'm on the pavement thinking 'bout the government ♪ Nobody's smoking here. There's smokers over there. There you are, cool as fucking cucumbers. How many smokers do we have here tonight? Smokers? - [scattered whistling] - Whoo! Look at that energy, they can pump out at will, huh? You... [wheezing] Over here... [wheezing] Oh... [wheezing] [wheezing, coughing] Thanks, smokers. A valiant effort on your part. Next time just hock up a chunk of lung when I need you, though, all right? Just rear back and launch a phlegm gem towards the stage. [spits] Get one of those "raw oysters" happening. [inhales, clears throat] [chittering] Hey, hey, phlegm shouldn't have legs. Now... I'm no doctor, but I've seen one on TV. You ready for this, smokers? Listen to this. How many non-smokers do we have here tonight? Non-smokers. [cheering, applause] What a bunch of whining maggots. Bunch of obnoxious, self-righteous slugs. Don't take that wrong. I'd quit smoking if I didn't think I'd become one of you, I swear to God. I'm willing to die seven years before my time just so I'll be cool each last fucking day. The worst kind of non-smoker... ...is the one where you're smoking, and they just walk up to you... [clears throat] [clears throat] [clears throat] I always say, "Shit, you're lucky you don't smoke. That's a hell of a cough you got there. I smoke all day and don't cough like that. Maybe you were conceived with a weak sperm or something. Maybe your dad was jerking off and your mom sat on it at the last second." Did I overreact? I don't think I did, did I? I think that's kind of cruel. I'm smoking and you come up coughing at me. Jesus! You go up to crippled people dancing too, you fucks? "Well, hey, Mr. Wheelchair. What's your problem? Come on, Ironside, race you!" You fucking sadists. I mean, the nerve! I'll smoke, I'll cough, I'll get the tumors, I'll die. Deal? Thank you, America. People say, "Well, it's the secondary smoke, it's not just the smoke that you smoke, but it's also the smoke that comes out." If it was just the smoke that you smoke, that'd be fine. But it's also, there's the secondary smoke that's also... ...because there's been reports and studies that the secondary smoke is also... If it wasn't just the smoke for you, but also the stuff that you breathe out, I wouldn't... [indistinct] Then it goes and it's third-dary smoke. Then fourth, but then by then I'm sick and I'm dead. So what do I do?" Good theory. But guess what? If I don't smoke, there's gonna be secondary bullets coming your way. 'Cause I'm that tense. But I'm trying to quit. How much do you smoke a day, sir? - [man] A pack. - A pack? What a little puss! God! Why don't you just put a dress on and show it all to us while you smoke your little faggoty pack. Come on, swish around for us. Damn it, that pisses me off. I go through two lighters a day, dude, all right? And I'm starting to feel it. I got this big fear doing smoking jokes in my act, right, showing up five years from now, going... "Good evening, everybody. Remember me? Smoking is bad." [shudders] You ever seen anybody do that? I've seen somebody do that, man. Let me tell you something: if you're smoking out of a hole in your neck... ...I'd think about quitting. And that's just me, you know. What I do do, though, I know all smokers do this, you notice this. Every cigarette pack has a Surgeon General's warning on it. How cool. Mine say, "Warning, smoking may cause fetal injury or premature birth." Fuck it. [laughs] I found my brand. Just don't get the ones that say "Lung cancer." You know, shop around. Hell, give me a carton of them "low birth weights." What the fuck do I care? "Why you so down, Bill?" "Low birth weight. Yeah. Smoking way too many low birth weights." [laughs] Mm-mm-mm! It tastes like steak and potatoes, doesn't it? See, I don't, you know, I don't drink, I smoke. I used to drink, you know, I did. I had to quit. Man, I was an embarrassing drunk, man. I get pulled over by the cops, I'd be so drunk, I'd be out dancing to their lights thinking I'd made it to another club. "Hey, what is this, a leather bar? Hey, hey, hey! I'm not into this, you faggots. Oh, shit!" Not drinking tonight? No! Why? You don't drink? Neither do I. Good. Good for you. Boy, I tell you, they changed that drunk driving shit, man. The attitude is just too harsh for me. Way too harsh. You remember ten years ago, anybody, ten years ago? If you got pulled over, cop came up to your car, "Son, you been drinking?" "Yeah." "Oh, sorry to bother you. Hope I didn't bring your buzz down any. Okay. Get on out of here, have some fun. Drink one for us. [laughs] We'll be joining you right after duty. Okay, bye-bye. Back in the car, Tommy, it's a drunk guy behind the wheel of an automobile, that's all." You remember that? Now you are the murderer. Remember, drunks go, "Why don't you catch murderers?" You are the fucking murderer. You know? And they're gonna nail you, man. They got that field sobriety test. Guaranteed. They start off slow, I love it. Walk a straight line. Well, shit. I've been so drunk I've peed in my own pants. But at no time could I not-- I could skip a fucking straight line. Touch your nose! Well, dude, I could shoot thorazine into my heart, and still find my fucking nose. I've never understood that one at all. That is just-- are people out there who cannot find their nose? I don't-- it's right there. Never will it move, I don't care how fucking drunk I am. I could have no arms, and still find my fucking nose. But then the kicker. Say the alphabet... - [man] Backwards! - ...backwards. Well, shit, you got me. I'm not drunk, but I'm obviously too stupid to be driving, goddamn it. Think somebody can actually do this? What kind of sobriety test is this? They're making this shit up as they go. They're having fun with you. You're jumping through hoops for these guys, man. They're sitting there going, "Shit, do a flip. Come here, son. Put your dick in our exhaust pipe. Do it right now." "Shit, I never heard of this one. These are officers, they know what they're dong. Goddamn, that's hot. Shit, how long have they been chasing us? Fuck!" Man, they're just having fun with you. This has nothing to do with sobriety test. You're... you're auditioning for your freedom, you think. ♪ Oh, Z, Y, Z, Y... I don't know the rest of it. They humiliate you for their own amusement, then they pop you. All right? So I say fuck it. "Walk a straight line and touch your nose." "Fuck that, I'm drunk. [sniffs] I might puke if I start moving around a lot. Oh! How about this, officer? How about you carry me to the back of your car? I think I'll start my 18-hour nap right now, buddy." You ever seen vomit go through that mesh screen between the front and back seat of their car? Oh, yeah. You're gonna rue the day you pulled me over, buddy. I've been eating bar olives for three days straight. I don't think it's gonna go with your crispy blues. Wouldn't that be great to be too drunk to bust? They just go, "Screw it, let him go. Boy, he did a nice flip, though, didn't he? Touching his nose the whole way around." Touch your nose? I don't... Every fucking time, never will I miss my nose. Oh, man. You know what was really humiliating, driving and drinking, I was driving a Chevette. Boy, that's... Getting that DWI in a Chevette. Goddamn it. Not like if I hit anyone it would make a difference, you know? Be fair. "Son, you're drunk, no doubt about it. But you're in a Chevette, buddy. Hell, go get 'em." [laughs] [engine revving sound] [thudding sound] Excuse me! [engine revving sound] [thudding sound] Pardon me! Sorry! [engine revving sound] [thudding sound] Fucking be like a Big Wheel hitting your shin, you know? They got mosquitoes bigger than these fucking cars. A piece of shit car. Turn the air conditioner on in a Chevette while you're driving, it's like hitting this car in the balls, man. The car just, "Oh! Oh! Oh!" [revving] It goes down to five all of a sudden. [low revving sound] I feel like the Flintstones in this thing. [low revving] You push the lighter in, the battery light comes on. [low revving] No wonder I'm fucking drunk. I hit a moth one time, did $400 damage in this piece of shit car. The moth was all right, he rolled with it. He took off, I'm waiting for a tow truck. "What happened to your car, buddy?" "Shit, I hit a bug." "You're lucky to be alive, son. A man in Tennessee man hit a ladybug in one of them things. Sheared his head clean off. And his thumbs. Really sort of a freak accident." [sighs] Oh, man. You're a good crowd. It's good to be back. A lot of partying here in Austin. Ton of partying. - [crowd cheering] - I don't do drugs. I want to thank management for offering, but I said no. And when I say no, it means... how much and can I get some more? No. It means no. I mean that. Unless you're giving it away. No, it means no. And can I also get some ludes to come down later? No, it means, seriously, it means no. Is the bar open? Oh, okay, no. It means... let's see how I... No. I used to do drugs. I had no luck with drugs, man. One time me and three friends dropped acid, drove around in my dad's car. He has one of those talking cars. We're tripping and the car goes, "The door is ajar." We pulled over and thought about that for 12 hours, man. "Shit, how can a door be a jar? Oh, shit, why would they put a jar on a car? Oh, shit, the freeway's melting. Put it in the jar!" This went on for hours. [imitates crickets] - "But if it's a jar..." - [imitates crickets] - "But what kind of car--" - [imitates crickets] - [imitates coyote howling] - "I'm tired." - [man] Elmer Dinkley! - Shit. Got pulled over tripping once. Whoo! There's a dream come true. I'll match that to any drunk story you got. Pulled over tripping. Jesus. The cop was tapping on this window, we're staring at him in this mirror over here. "How tall are you? Ooh! Shit! Ambush! Big one and a little one. Twins. Oh, shit. Be cool. Z..." So I don't do drugs. I got nothing against drugs. I got nothing against drugs. I think it's a personal choice. Just like alcohol, just like cigarettes. As long as that personal choice does not infringe upon the freedoms of another person's personal choice. Really. That's the end of the story. That's called logic, it'll help you. George Bush says we are losing the war on drugs. Well, you know what that implies? There's a war going on and people on drugs are winning it! [laughs] Well, what does that tell you about drugs? Some smart, creative motherfuckers on that side. They're winning a war and they're fucked up! A lot of ya'll don't even know you're fighting, do you? You're sitting there going, "Fuck, I'm watching Saturday Night Live. Are we winning? What the fuck? I feel like my flank is covered. Honey, bring me a beer. Got a war to win! [laughs]" Fucking war is that? You know, the war on drugs is hypocrisy, man. That's why it's not gonna work, it's fucking a lie. Alcohol and cigarettes kills more people than crack, coke and heroin combined. So the war on drugs is really sort of a cock suck, isn't it? You alcoholics are going, "Shit, we're next. If they're fighting drugs, 'cause we could be taken. [laughs] Drug guys are creative motherfuckers. We're just obnoxious, man. We're fucking out there. Hey, here comes the fight." You know what the problem with the war on drugs is? They lump all drugs together. You know what I mean? Pot and crack! And they're not the same. Not only do I think pot should be legalized, - I think it should be mandatory. - [cheering] Think about it. You get in traffic behind somebody... [imitates horn honking] "Shut up and smoke that. It's the law." [inhales] "Oh, sorry, I was taking life seriously." [laughs] "Oh, shit, I'm sorry about all that noise. I thought it mattered." [laughs, inhales] "Oh, shit, who's hungry?" That'd be a nice world, wouldn't it? Mellow, hungry, fucked up people everywhere? Domino's Pizza trucks passing each other on every highway. Parades of Domino's. [imitates horn honking] Let them get stuck in traffic, all our pizzas will be free. The war on drugs. You know what's wild? You never see a positive drug story on the news, do you? Ever seen one? Isn't that weird? Don't you think that's strange? I mean, the news is supposed to be objective, isn't it supposed to be... the news? But every drug story is negative? Well, hold it. I've had some killer times on drugs. I'm not promoting it, but I'm not denying it. Let's hear the whole fucking story. Same LSD story every time. We've all heard it. Young man on acid thought he could fly, jumped out of a building. What a tragedy. What a dick. Don't go blaming acid on this fucking guy. Hey, hey, hey. If he thought he could fly, let him take off from the ground and check it out first. Fuck it. He's an idiot. He's dead. Good. You don't see ducks lined up to catch elevators to fly north, do you? No, they fly from the fucking ground. The guy was a moron. He's dead. Good. No tragedy. To me, there's one less idiot in the world. Whoo! How am I gonna sleep through the night? "Why so down, Bill?" "We're missing a moron. [sobbing] We're missing a moron!" I'm not trying to be cold or cruel. You know, but goddamn. Let's hear the whole story. Wouldn't you like to see a positive LSD story on the news, to hear what it's all about, perhaps? Wouldn't that be interesting, just once? "Today, a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration, that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There's no such thing as death, life is only a dream, we're the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom with the weather." [cheering, applause] "Wow! Did you see the news? Something about how we're God's perfect and holy thoughts and we live in his mind and there's no reason to suffer or lack. Ever. I thought it was sort of newsworthy. Then again, I was fucked up at the time, so who knows?" Shit, man, it's got too many mixed signals, you know what I mean? A lot of our heroes are big drug users. It's tough for us, right? And when you're really down and out, you can always think, hey, if drugs are so bad for us, how come Keith Richards still fucking walks? Let's hear the Surgeon General's report on Keith. Little hole in the theory there. Surgeon General says, "Drugs are bad. Drugs are evil. - [man mutters] - Except for that guy. They work real well for him, but the rest of you." It's like that commercial, the guy with the skillet. "This is your brain. [sizzling sound] Here's Keith's brain. [sizzling sound] Here's Keith's brain on drugs." [hums "Satisfaction"] Hey, that sounds pretty good. That's him on drugs? Well, shit. Give him some more. Let's see what else he pumps out. Here's Keith almost dead. [hums rock music] Well, fuck it, let's kill him. Get some real hits. I'm telling you, man. Keith Richards outlived Jim Fixx, the runner and health nut. The plot thickens. You remember Jim Fixx? This human cipher, used to write books on jogging. Now, what do you fucking write about jogging? "Right foot, left foot. Faster, faster. Oh, hell, I don't know. Go home, shower." Pretty much covers the jogging experience, I do believe. Then this doofus goes out and has a heart attack and dies... ...while jogging. Ahh! [laughs] There is a God. Right foot, left foot. Hemorrhage. "Eh, Jim, we're gonna need a happier ending, buddy. Got your latest manuscript. Right foot, left foot. Blood spurts out. Now, Jim, what the hell is this? You having problems at home, buddy?" Shit, man. Keith Richards is shooting heroin into the vein under his cock and he's still touring, all right? I'm getting mixed signals. That's all I'm saying. I'm not pro or con, I'm just saying. Drink up, have fun. There is no death. Drink up, have fun. Don't suffer, don't feel guilty. Drink up, have fun. Don't feel guilty, don't suffer for there is no death. God loves you no matter what you do, you are the perfect holy child with God. And as my friend Jimmy Pineapple would say, "Case fucking closed." [applause] 'Cause I get depressed. You don't think I don't? Shit, you think I'm wearing all black in the summertime 'cause I'm a fucking ray of sunshine, dude? The fact that we live in a world where John Lennon was murdered yet Barry Manilow continues to put out albums, oh, yeah. Whoo-hoo! Man, if you're gonna kill somebody, have some fucking taste.

That's all. Every time you listen to the record, you're thinking, "God, I'd love to eat another woman's pussy." But fine, enjoy it, you know. Enjoy it. Don't feel guilty. Do what you wanna do. And God loves you no matter what you do. But understand that every time you listen to George Michaels or give him money, that you're thinking, "My God, what would I not give to have a bush in my mouth right now. My God, to smell that stinky little peace fish, oh, Lord. Oh, give me that stuff. Let it drip like honey." But understand that that's cool. But that is what it is. [laughs] George Michaels, man. Have you seen this guy? He's hawking Diet Cokes now. Have you seen that commercial? "Whoo! Diet Cokes! I'm George Michaels! Look, I'm a rock star!" What kind of Reagan wet dream is this fucking world, man? These are our rock stars, you know? Hawking Diet Cokes. What real rock star would do something like that? It's Keith Moon for Snickers! "Sometimes I'm doing a drum solo, and I haven't eaten for like three fucking weeks. The needle broke off in me arm. I eat a Snickers!" That's a rock star. "Diet Coke!" Why don't you just put a skirt on and get on a swing set for that commercial, George? "Diet Coke! Come on, ya'll, let's drink Diet Coke together and listen to rock music. Come on, hee-hee-hee! Come on, everybody, I got extra panties in the tour bus. Let's go. Come on, I got panties for everybody. We're gonna drink Diet Cokes so our little bottom doesn't get too big.

She's dead, he's a woman, Jimi's still jamming. I'm a dreamer. [laughs] I am available for children's parties, by the way. Those of you who have a youngun coming of age. Don't wanna go the traditional clown, balloon animal route this year. Yeah, we got you a clown, Tommy. Bill's a Bozo. [chuckles evilly] Jimi Hendrix, that was a casualty. So there you come full circle. Jimi Hendrix died in a pool of his own vomit. Uh! You know how much you have to puke to fill up a pool? [vomiting sounds] No diving yet. [retching] Okay, Keith Moon, cannonball. Jim Morrison on the high dive. Janis Joplin in the wading pool. [gurgling] There have been casualties. - Some of them... - [man] John Bonham! Yeah, it's John Bonham for Certs. "I threw up blood in my sleep last night. And I got a date with two 13-year-old twins. They hate the smell of blood on a man. I suck Certs." Diet Coke! Whoo! We're the new rockstars! Come on! Rock on, get the good drink! Boy, I tell you, if money had a dick, George Michaels would be a flaming faggot. "Oh, Diet Coke? Oh, yeah! Mm! I love Diet Coke. Uh-huh. Oh! Oh, God. I drink it every day. Uh-huh. It's good! Oh, yeah. Oh, only one calorie? Okay. My check signed yet? Oh, God." Make me fucking sick. There have been casualties.

I can't even fit in my jumpsuit." ♪ I did it Nick's way [laughs] Everyone was so shocked about Elvis dying of drugs. That was so sad, wasn't it? "Why'd it have to be Elvis?

Mr. Surveyor. There he is. What the hell is he surveying all day? You know what he surveys all day long? That dick with the stick. Who is this doofus? Does he get a check? The guy that holds the stick, does he pick up some cash? How do you advertise for that job? "Are you willing to stand by the freeway in the sun and be called asshole by air-conditioned oncoming cars?" "Well, sure, I can do that." What a dick.

You gotta be at work? - [man] Elmer Dinkley! - No, no, no! - [man] Yes! - God, okay. I was in this real small town once, all right? Town was so small, get this, you know in hotel rooms, you gotta dial nine to get an outside line? Right? Get this. I dialed nine, and got the Elmer Dinkley residence. "Hello? Who's this?" "Elmer Dinkley, you just called my house." "Your phone number's nine?" "Well, shit, my cousin's is 23. I had to write that one down. Wrote it on my forehead. I keep calling 32. [laughs] I said, 'How do you hold the phone without a thumb?' I go to the Waffle House and get syrup on my hands. They stick to everything." "Do Elmer Dinkley again!" [laughs, indistinct] [audience] Whoo! Thank you. I love what I do. I have the greatest job in the world. What do you do, sir? An engineer? Any particular train? Okay, thank you. See, you have to do the engineer joke... what do you do? Human resources? Uh, you mall... mine... malls? What do you, mine malls? What do you do? What is that exactly? Oh, computer corporation. Thank you. Sorry. Sorry. We're about to get into demographics and marketing. "Uh, Bill, we'd like to have you on our TV show, but our demographics show that our people that watch our show are really stupid and sensitive and, uh, they can't really deal with somebody who's saying something that's beyond the mall perception of the world. So, Bill, we think you're really funny and creative, but our marketing shows that our audience is targeted towards people who watch George Michael and then go actually buy Diet Coke. 'Cause that little fairy princess is drinking it. So, Bill, you wouldn't really fit in in the scheme of the world as we see it. [snorts]" [snorting] Gross! Ooh! There's a raw oyster, man. One of them half shell deals. Dude, I like the sunglasses in the nightclub. That's a neat touch. Mr. Cool Guy with the bloody shins over there. Nah, nah, nah. Ooh! "Shit, I didn't see that fucking chair. Goddamn, my glasses make me look cool. Oh! Oh, Jesus! But I look cool, right? All right. I'm bleeding from several different bones here. But now I got my sunglasses in a nightclub, so God knows I'm the coolest dude on Earth. [slow-motion] Oh! I'm cool. Oh, shit!" Take your fucking sunglasses off, it's nighttime. "But I gotta be cool, I gotta be cool. I've gotta compensate for that fucking penny shirt, goddamn it." Get a shot of that fucking shirt! I'm gonna leave you here with a brand-new penny shirt, dude. Thank you. You're a beautiful audience. I wanna thank each and every one of you. - What do you do? - [man] Garbageman. Garbageman! What a great job. But call it preventive medicine. Really. See, I can't work, ya'll. I can't work is why... Bosses. Aren't they something? Bosses. They're like gnats on a camping trip, aren't they? [buzzing] [buzzing] Get the fuck out of my face. It's just a job, it doesn't mean a thing, all right, dude? I smoked a joint this morning, you're lucky I showed, bud. My bed was like a womb. Boy, they say childbirth is hard on a woman. I think it's harder on the kid, man. You just don't get to hear their side till they're 13. Then they're just pissed, they forgot why. Think about childbirth. Your first nine months alive, rent free, free food, constantly asleep. Ooh, that's gonna fucking last. Suddenly, you're pushed into the light. [grunting] [grunting] Pssh! Get a job! [screaming] Pretty fucking traumatic. But I'm over it. 'Cause I don't have to get a job. Bosses. You know what I always used to get from my boss? "Hicks, how come you're not working?" I go, "There's nothing to do." He goes, "Well, you pretend like you're working, son." And I go, "Why don't you pretend I'm working. You get paid more than me, you fantasize. Shit, pretend I'm mopping. I'll pretend they're buying shit, we can close up. Hey! I'm the boss now, you're fired. How's that for a fantasy, sir? I'm on a roll." Pretend to work, give me a... First of all, the very idea that anybody could be my boss, well, you see the conflict. What do you do? Salesman. What do you sell? Computers. Oh, Jesus. [sighs] Oh, man. I used to sell ladies' shoes. That was a great job. You know why? Women came in wearing dresses to try on shoes, and I'm the guy helping them on with their shoes. I don't know if you ladies do that on purpose, but... dang. I mean, all day long, man, they're sitting there in skirts going, "Uh... How does that look?" [chuckles] "Uh... That looks great. Yeah, it's you. Most definitely you." "Oh, it's kind of tight." [chuckles] "I can stretch it out for you." So when I was fired from that job... I actually had to use the shoe horn. All right, I'm hung like a sea horse. Relax. Hm... Anybody here travel because of their job? - [woman] Uh-huh! - Oh, yeah. Where are you? - [woman] Right here. - [laughs] I think people pay you to leave their fucking city, is that it? Some kind of schizophrenic ventriloquist bitch you are. "Oh, yeah. Over here. Now I'm over here. Ah! Ah!" One thing I hate about my job, I like it, I travel. Anybody here travel on a regular basis? - [man] Yeah! - Elmer Dinkley back here. Great. What do you do? It's Friday. We forgot, till Monday. - [man] Sales representative. - Sales representative. No idea what that is. I'm so... Yeah, I'm an amusement engineer. Okay? Fuck this noise. What are these fucking careers? "I'm a rep of the marketing demographics... the marketing..." [snorting, roaring] "I foreclose on people, all right? Get out of my face! I'm a rep who belongs in the marketing... [mumbling]" Yeah, right. I like this guy. "I'm a garbageman." [sniffs] Simple and to the point. So you travel a lot. Do you stay in hotels? - [man] Yes. - Can you help me with something? - [man] Yes. - Does "do not disturb" mean knock immediately in Spanish? Or, uh... Or what the fuck is the problem here? Do not disturb. Fairly clear. Then again, I'm a reader. So... Put that sign on your door, within five minutes, they're there. "Housekeeping!" [knocking microphone] That's not too disturbing, is it? "Do you need fresh towels?" "Yeah, I'm gonna need to wipe up your blood... ...if you keep knocking on that fucking door." That usually gets rid of them for a couple of minutes. They'll even walk in with a pass key, have you ever had that? Your room, you're in it, "do not disturb" on the fucking door. Housekeeping just strolls right... You're sitting there going, "Hey, hey, hey!" "I'm here to change the sheets." "Come back in five minutes. You're gonna be working overtime on this crusty pillow case. I'm young too, you better check the ceilings, honey." No, I don't wanna seem shallow. [clears throat] But... she started it. Said "do not disturb." It didn't say "come in and catch me jacking off." If it said that, she would have never showed. You know? Life. What are you gonna do about living? Like there's anything to jack off to in a hotel room. You ever been in hotel rooms lately, anybody? They don't have cable anymore, they got Spectervision. You know what that is? Where you buy the movies? Thank you. "Huh? Go back, go back. Hotels?" You aren't on some bus from Tennessee, are you here? Aren't you? Wait... "Let me see. There you go. Thank you." You buy the movies? Great. They got movies on there, it says right there on the movie card, "adult feature." It's on after midnight. Costs $6.35, adult feature. Movie's called Sex Kittens. Adult feature. On after midnight. $6.35. Well, guess what? I'm an adult, I got $6.35, and I'm up after fucking 12. Let's see it. Have you ever seen one of these? It's a pornographic movie but the pornography is cut out of it! Ahh! [laughs] Whoo! There's a frustrating hour. I don't think the plot and dialogue alone are enough to carry these films, ya'll. I think they should leave them fucking scenes in. They got all these weird cuts where you don't see the woman at all. But what do they leave in? Uh! The guy's hairy ass. [humming] [continues humming] "Housekeeping!" "Go away! I'm looking at a guy's hairy ass!" [humming] Where are the sex kittens? Two guys make these movies, one guy films his own ass, the other guy has a wah-wah pedal and comes up with titles. These guys are making a fortune. "Let's call this one Stewardesses in Heat." "Good title, Timmy. Film my butt." [imitates wah-wah pedal guitar] "Let's call this one Waitress Daisy Chain. I love it!" [imitates wah-wah pedal guitar] "Let's call this one Bitch Cheerleader. Great! Get a close-up!" [imitates wah-wah pedal guitar] Where are the fucking girls? That's not an adult feature, that's a guy's hairy bobbing ass! It's for psychotics! It's not an adult feature unless at the end someone's gooey. Arcing ropes of jism hitting chins, that's an adult feature. Women licking up semen like kittens under a cow udder, that is an adult... No, no, no. [imitates wah-wah pedal guitar] We got a hairy ass. Shit, I could have looked at my own ass in the mirror. What the fuck is this? I paid six bucks to see a guy's ass? Boy, I don't even wanna pay this bill. I'm jumping out the fucking window. "Hey, look at the ass." [exploding sound] Hey, it said Sex Kittens, not Hairy Man Ass. If it had said Hairy Man Ass, I would have never bought the fucking thing, I swear to you! I'm not like that. Bobbing Hairy Man Ass, no thank you. I'll watch fucking Terminator again. I'll watch Predator. I mean, is it me? Am I like an open nerve to you people? What the fuck? I don't even wanna open that Pandora's box, psycho... She says, "Wait." [groans] [groaning] [groaning] [snorting, roaring] Jesus, is there a beast in the house? But get this, the other day, my friend had this hardcore pornographic magazine, right? Okay, it was me. But, uh... The funny thing about these magazines, how pompous the pornography industry is. Right? They're so pompous. The beginning of the magazine has a disclaimer that says, "None of our models-- all of our models are 17 years and older." These are models. Yeah, tell me something, how is semen being worn this year? Is it being worn back or in bangs or off the chin? Uh, these are models. Yeah, here's Dusty modeling a 14-inch cock in her ass. Come on down, Dusty, and show us how cocks are gonna be worn this year, honey. This is big in Europe. Uh, and here's Dallas with a penis ensemble. These are models. And I'm an amusement engineer. I don't know, AIDS, man. You gotta get porno movies pre-AIDS to get 'em really nasty. 'Cause with AIDS, they got like their fingers crossed and shit. You know? Cum on the belly, cum on the ass, cum on the belly, cum on... Pre-AIDS, it's just, "Ahh!" [laughs] Do I seem shallow to you? I don't get it. Ya'll are staring at me like a dog that's just been shown a card trick. "You know, I don't ever recall hearing a joke with the word 'jism' in it before. This is a definite first, honey. Thought I'd take my girl out and see a nice little comedy show about McNuggets and shit. But not jism. What is this shit?" Knock-knock. Who's there? Jism. [cackles] It's Bill the Bozo. AIDS, man. I swear, that's... What other generation had anything comparable to AIDS? You know what I mean? The '50s, rug burn. Pshht. Boy, I don't know how much AIDS scares ya'll, but I got a theory. The day they come out with a cure for AIDS, guaranteed one shot, no problem cure on that day there's gonna be fucking in the streets, man. "It's over! Who are you? Come here. No, it's over. Yeah. I fucked your head off, baby. Goddamn. That's what's gonna happen, goddamn, I'm gonna fuck your head right off." As soon as they cure AIDS, baby, you better start running, goddamn it. It could happen on the lawn. Then we're gonna have that big rubber bonfire out back. There's gonna be news cameras on every corner. "They're fucking everywhere! This is Dan Rather, you're not gonna believe this shit, ya'll. It is a world orgy. They've cured AIDS, and everybody's fucking! Look at 'em!" 'Course all they're gonna show on the news is... [imitates wah-wah pedal guitar] 'Cause apparently, a man's hairy bobbing ass is adult entertainment in our world. I don't know who started it. You're a great crowd. I can either get off now or do... Mom and Dad, no, no, no. - [audience] Yeah! - No, no, no. I'd rather do Elmer Dinkley for two hours straight. - [man] Do it! No! - No. No, no. I've got material planned. I didn't say I'd take fucking requests. Okay? I said if you wanted to hear it, I'd stay. This is fucking-- I'm not a juke box. "Shove a quarter up his ass and tell him to do Elmer Dinkley again." [shouting] I'm in this small town, and there's a mall, and I called up Elmer Dinkley's house. "Hey, we're supposed to get two plays on a quarter." What? What the fuck am I talking about? This world, man. Before I go, I gotta tell you about the world that I see. It's sad sometimes. You ever realize that we live in a world where good men are murdered and mediocre hacks thrive? You ever notice that? John Kennedy murdered, Gandhi murdered, Martin Luther King murdered, Jesus murdered, Reagan wounded. Cancer eight times, now that fucker still walks. I mean... [snorting] That guy is Jason, man. You could take off that hockey mask just once, you're gonna find, "Well, I'm back." People love him. Love him! Every fact points that he's a liar, corporate puppet, devil cocksucking fascist. Every fact points to that. Not one fact to the opposite. But what happens? "We love you, Ronnie. Four more years, four more years. Let's put him on Mount Rushmore. Ha-ha-ha!" Let's put him under Mount Rushmore. They love him! How far up your ass does this guy's dick have to be before you realize he's fucking you, man? People are just, "I like him. I don't know what it is. He looks good on TV, he brought back patriotism. Goddamn it, he's a good American. Hold it, something's slapping my ass. Oh, my God, he's fucking us!" "Well, Nancy and I feel that, uh, man, you might know, as John Wayne once told me, that, uh, man, you might remember as Jimmy Stewart--" Shut the fuck up. Answer a question like a man, you fucking lying B-actor dickweed Mr. President, sir. With all due respect. Now we got his little incubus underling, Georgie Bush, in there. Boy, when they said anybody in America could grow up to be president, I didn't know what the fuck that meant till this year. Anybody. A body of water. A dead body. Who does Shell want in there? Who does Diet Coke want as president? That's what... Fuck. And Danny Quayle. You don't see much of Danny Quayle, do you, boy? They got that little bootlicker under wraps. There's been more sightings of Elvis. Man, they got that little Nazi in a hamper somewhere. "You won, Dan, now stay in the fucking box." "I wanna come out and buy missiles." [giggles] "Stay in the box! We're stretching public belief factor real thin with you, dude. But hey, Three's Company was on the air ten years. We'll make it work." They will make it work, too. You're already reacting like that, aren't you? You're already doing it, I can see it. You're already going... "You know that Danny Quayle? Goddamn it, he's all right. So what if he's a military hawk who avoided service? You know, he looks just like Robert Redford." Remember that bullshit? "Robert Redford lookalike." Yeah, well, Robert Redford doesn't look like a hairless pink ferret, so... Little fucking Nazi. Thank you. I, uh... I'm sick of this shit, man. It's ridic-- Our emotions are running wild and our mind is stopped, man. The flag burning thing. Oh, God, did that bring up some retarded emotions. "The flag! The flag! Oh, my God, they burned the flag!" They didn't say that. They said if a guy burns the flag, he perhaps doesn't need to go jail. For a fucking year. Pretty harsh on their part, isn't it? People going, "Hey, buddy, let me tell you something. My daddy died for that flag." Really? I bought mine. You know they sell them at Kmart and shit, yeah. Three bucks. "He died in the Korean War for that flag." What a coincidence? Mine was made in Korea. Didn't die for a fucking flag. It's a piece of cloth. He died for what the flag represents, which is the freedom to burn the fucking flag. And as my friend Jimmy Pineapple would say, "Case fucking closed." If you don't wanna burn a flag, then I'd recommend you don't burn it. I love ya'll, you feel that. Do we? "Feel like we're being lectured by some kind of pale demon." Well, that too. How many of ya'll think I could be the Antichrist at this point in the show? That's not enough. I'm not the Antichrist. It's two sixes and a nine, ya'll. I'm bluffing. But I know who the Antichrist is. And yes, he's here on Earth. A lot of people thought Khomeini, good choice. A lot of people thought Gaddafi, Nostradamus, the purple turban reference. Oh, they fucking have any clue what that is. I don't even know what that is. I bought that-- I bought that segueway. Dick Clark. Ludicrous, isn't it? Dick Clark, the Antichrist. Now, wait a minute, though. Hear me out. Who's been on TV as long as you can recall? Dick Clark. Who has not aged one fucking day? Dick Clark. Who brings us Tiffany, Wham, Debbie Gibson... - [man] Rick Astley. - Rick Astley. Dick Clark. Hm... That is not Dick Clark, ya'll. That is a Dick Clark rubber mask with a zipper in the back. And when he gets off that TV show, year after year, week after week, bringing us these hack, mediocre, piece of shit acts, he walks into his office and he unzips that zipper and underneath, there's a cloven-hoofed horned wolverine. [snorting, roaring] There's a knock at the door. "Housekeeping." Not this time, kids. The door opens, and John Davidson walks in. [snorting, roaring] John Davidson drops his pants in his bikini panties, and leans his taut, tucked, tan little Hollywood ass over a desk. Anyone not know where this one's headed? The wolverine puts on some mood music. [static sound] ♪ Lady ♪ You're my knight in shining armor ♪ Obligingly, Mr. Davidson parts his buttocks to reveal a pink, jasmine-scented anus. Which pooches open in anticipation. ♪ And I love you A butterfly flies out and circles the wolverine's head. ♪ Lady The wolverine mounts him. [snorting, roaring] Stop me if you've heard this. [snorting, roaring] He explodes a cloud of silverfish. Followed by a black blood-engorged tick, which crawls out of the scaly penis of the wolverine into the bowels of John Davidson. John Davidson is now pregnant... Good night, folks. ...with the children... [laughs] Hey, if I'm not gonna leave, ya'll have to. - [cheering] - [laughs] I'm like a reverse maitre d. Good night, folks. [indistinct] right outside, huh? John Davidson is now pregnant with the children of the Prince of Darkness. That's how it works. In the offseason, he becomes swollen and fat. So fat and swollen, in fact, that his dimples filled. [man] No! Six months, six days and six hours later, his bile breaks. And he shits the brood. [farting sound] [farting continues] [farting continues] [farting continues] [farting continues] Geraldo Rivera... [audience cheering] Don't you see? You were a great crowd. Before I go, even though this is a world where good men are murdered, men try and help are murdered and cut down in the prime of their youth and hacks and mediocres and fascists run everything else, I'm gonna share with you a vision that I had. 'Cause I love you. And you feel it. You know all that money we spend on nuclear weapons and defense every year? Trillions of dollars, correct? Instead, instead, just play with this. If we spent that money feeding and clothing the poor of the world, and it would pay for it many times over, not one human being excluded, we could, as one race, explore outer space together in peace forever. - [man whistles] - [imitates gunfire] [thunder crashing] [man] Comedy show. Satanic and offensive. Editor, my husband and I went to Bill Hicks' performance expecting comedy. What we got was far from comedy. In two hours, we were, quote-unquote, entertained by this comedian who delighted us in his opinions on how smoking is great, and non-smokers are expletive. Drinking and drugs are lots of fun and all fine and dandy. - [laughter] - The audience was flipped off by this comedian. This is comedy? Then it got worse. We were given one comedian's enactment of two young girls performing oral sex on each other. We were shown how former President Reagan screwed us. Another vulgar sex imitation. We were shown how a rock star should rape a young girl and how it would hurt her so badly she would yell for her mom. [laughter] This is comedy? The comedian told us how he doesn't like porno, unless they show... No, I don't even think the newspaper can print that one. Toward the end of the show, the comedian stated he wanted us to think he was the Antichrist. My point is, we did not know comedy works dished out two hours of vulgarity. The language alone was enough to make one ill. I would like to inform anyone thinking of going to Bill Hicks' performance that it is anything but comedy. [laughter, applause]
