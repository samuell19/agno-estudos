Alright, this is the gun lap for the re-election, so give it to me straight. Well, there are no major defectors for campaign contributions, dear. The war chest is in excellent shape. -Good. Very good. What is our image? We've programmed the latest polls, senator. Lewis-Harris gave us the random-pattern sampling with peer group anchorage. Gallup, a saturization vertical syndrome study with horizontal personality backstopping. and NORC ran an ethnic study with racial and religious breakdown, status group compensation, and socioeconomic balancing. Yes. Good... but, am I winning or losing? Losing, senator. Losing? But why? The computers had me ahead last December. It checks out on both computers plus the one we have as a safety valve backstopping cross-check. If the elections were held today, you would lose by 1.846 percentile. 1.846 percentile. Oh, yes. Hmm... The computers don't lie. Isn't there a possible breakthrough with any of the peer groups? How are we doing on the Jewish vote? The senator's solid with the Jews, Mrs. Hennington. The Negroes are the trouble spot. The Negroes? I'm the best friend those people have in Washington! The computers indicate a sharp decline immediately after your law-and-order speech last Winter. [sighs] Alright, alright. Now, let's see if we can come up with some ideas here. First, how do we retrieve the lost Neg... Black vote? Gil, why don't we accuse the CIA of a racially discriminatory hiring policy? They have no Negroes. Except on a menial level, you know. You're certain Belinda? I mean, that may be it. I'm positive. But I'll check it out with our man over at personnel. Good. Whoever they select will be the best-known spy since 007. You may now stand. Raise your right hands and repeat after me. I do hereby swear I do hereby swear To uphold the laws of the United States of America To uphold the laws of the United States of America ...and those laws governing the Central Intelligence Agency. What do you see in this ink blot? I see a man. If I were undercover as a political or economic officer in an embassy and I was questioned about racisim in the United States, I'd point out that they also have racial and religous troubles. A thing like that isn't resloved overnight. And that our country is firmly behind racial progress and great strides are being made here. Thank you. And so on behalf of the director of our Agency, I'd like to offer congratulations on completing our tough preliminary training course. After weeks of physical and psychological testing, you ten men have survived the more than forty already sworn in, who in turn were selected from a careful screening and security check of hundreds. You men, therefore represent the best of your race. The survivors of our regular training course that begin tomorrow will be the first of your race to join the finest intelligence and espionage fraternity in the history of mankind. I must emphasize however that you are by no means agents as yet. The selecting-out process continues right up until graduation day. So, keep on your toes, keep your noses clean and I hope to congratulate you on joining the team at the end of the training course. Thank you. Well, ain't it groovy to be a spy? Right on! Really! We the first spooks to be spooks for the CIA! [group laughter] Hey man, you know how much this Scotch costs in the commissary? Three dollars. Chivas Regal. Yeah that's cheaper overseas, man. Yeah and rent-free housing overseas, too. You went to Fisk, didn't you? I'm from Harvard. Say, you a frat man? Yeah man, Alpha. No kidding baby, so am I! Okay! Didn't we meet last year at the Penn Relays? Wow man, yeah! At that party at the motel! [laughter] Hey man, we got it made now. Yeah but don't forget what Carstairs said. They can still flunk us out. Yeah I don't think Carstairs would be uptight if we all flunked out. You know that PT instructor Calhoun hates us. Hey man it doesn't matter how they feel. Y'know, the word is integration. From the top. Now, some of us have gotta make it... and we're it. You just have to understand the theory of tokenism. Look... they grade on a curve. None of us get too eager... Gentleman's seat for everybody, right? Hear hear. - Right. Four more seconds. [explosion] As you can see, gentlemen there is one quick way to fail this course. ...then we take the two wires. Place them here and crimp them together making the connection positive. Take the switch there and we throw it. Alright, we'll operate the ignition by remote control. Always use those materials which are easily accessible to any citizen of the country in which you are operating. Okay. Let's go. [rapid gunfire] How long before this experiment in integration ends? There are only six left in the group, general. And? The top-ranking man academically will fail the physical requirements. He's no athlete. Another figures to flunk this week's exam, but one might make it. You assured me two weeks ago no one would survive! - Somehow I forgot Freeman even existed. He has a way of fading into the background, but he's been among the top three in academics and first in athletic training. Yes, they do make good athletes. Which one is he? That one. [door knock] Come in! Hey, Freeman. - Hey. Come on in. Listen, we're going into Washington. Wanna come along with us? No. Got some studying to do. - Oh. They been letting us in town for a month now man and you ain't been outta here yet. You're goin nuts in here. - Well, maybe next time. Maybe you oughta cool it. - Cool it? Mhm. Cool it. If you weren't so eager to please the white man, and send that grading curve up there'd be three times as many of us here now. What kinda Tom are you, anyway? The same as you I guess. Except that I don't try to have it both ways. And you better watch what you say about white folks behind their back. This place could be bugged. [sigh] Are you calling me a Tom, man? Well, none of us were picked for our militancy, now were we? Now why don't you go away and let me alone? Why don't you join the team, man? Team? Man, I'm not playing any games. Man, you just don't belong. I think you'd be happier with a mop in your hands! Like your mama. Let's step outside, now. No. [music stops] No. You don't wanna step outside with me. Because baby, I would kick your ass. Come on now. - No no no, wait a minute, man! No, no wait a minute! This fool is crazy man! [Freeman sighs] Uh, glass of Courvoisier. And would you give the young lady down there at the bar whatever she's drinking? Yes. This is from the fella to the end of the bar. Thank you. My pleasure. You lookin' for some action? Yeah. How much? Fifteen and five. Five for the hotel. Yeah. And all night? Not on Saturday, baby. Okay. You know, you remind me of someone. Oh, really? Who? A queen. Look baby, all you got to do is give me my bread. You don't have to talk no trash. No, really. What kinda queen? A queen from Dahomey. Da-who? What the hell is Dahomey? Dahomey was a great nation of Africa. Africa? No, really. I've got a book with a picture and you look just like her. I'll give you the book. Sure. No, you two could be twins except that she um, wore her hair different. How? Almost kinda like natural, you know? The way it grew. You'd look good like that. Look, honey... If you a hairdresser, maybe I can get you a boy. No, no, no. You'll do. Good. Then why don't you just be a trick and stop talking all that shit about queens and kinky hair? Okay, okay. Listen, can I get you another drink? Mmhmm. [liquid pouring] You really got a book with a picture in it that look like me? I'll bring you the book. When? The next time I see you. Ugh! Matte. Rei. Hai. Rei. Mr. Freeman. You will stay for additional instruction. Mr. Freeman, I don't think you people belong in our outfit. I don't have anything against the rest of the group. They just don't measure up. But you I don't like. I don't understand, sir. Well, I don't like your phony humility and I don't like your style. This is a team for men. Not misplaced cotton pickers. - Yes, sir. Stow the "yassah boss," it doesn't work on me. I'll give you a chance. Just go up to the office and resign. Otherwise, we fight. Now your black belt matches my own so you won't be able to whine "brutality." Equal opportunity that you people claim you want. Mr. Soo, shinpan. Hi-ya! Hi - ! Ya! Hi-ya! Rest? No. Ain't no rest for the weary. Hi-ya! Hi-ya! Hi-ya! [Calhoun screams] Hi-ya! [loud slam] Calhoun-san, are you alright? Hey, baby. Don't look so sad. Be back in a month. Well, at least we won't have to stay in a hotel. They let us start commuting in two weeks and I'm gonna get us a pad. You know, I don't mind this place too much. It kinda reminds me of that hotel off campus. Remember? Well, listen. What would happen to the Cook County Department of Welfare if the star caseworker missed work tomorrow? Casework supervisor, hon! Okay, okay, Ms. Bigtime! But what would happen? You mean play hooky? Yeah. I found a beautiful restaurant last week. Ooh, do they have shark's fin soup? No it's a West Indian restaurant. Oh, shark's fin soup with peas and rice, huh? Yes. - Hmm. Hope they stay open late. They've all been eliminated except Freeman, sir. Will he make it? I think so. He has written and oral finals this week. Security? Checks out so far. Routine security checks in the training barracks and checks on his activities in Washington. Of course he's only been allowed out of the training area for the last two months. Anything suspicious? Uh, no sir. He checked into a colored hotel, spent his weekends in the ghetto. Mostly on U street. That's pretty tough territory. Yes sir, but he seems at home there. He grew up in a neighborhood much like it in Chicago. How did he get through college? Athletic scholarship. That figures. Also explains the Calhoun incident. Sir, in fairness to Calhoun, Freeman's been studying Judo privately for years. Politics? Apolitical. He was involved in Civil Rights activity as a student, but nothing pink or radical. Men or women? Women. No hint of homosexuality. Developed a liaison with a prostitute on U street. Also has a girlfriend in Chicago. Apparently he's known her since they were college students. Why don't you run a final six-nine security check. It's already in progress. It should be finished in a few days. And whirl up a dossier on this whore and give it to me. Leave Freeman's file. Security is in? Yes sir. Figured out something for him to do? Yes sir. Well, like it or not, look's as if we're intergrated. Do you know if he takes any dope? Heroin, LSD, marijuana, pills? No. He don't even smoke. He ain't no junkie, baby. Does he have a tendency to boast? Brag about himself? He don't talk about himself at all. Most regular tricks wanna tell you the story of their whole lives. Does he gamble? If he do I don't know about it. Took him to a join one night. Craps, poker. If he get in, I get a cut. He just stand around and look. Would you say he's violent? Uncontrollable temper? Temper? No. He don't never lose his cool. But people don't give him no shit. Oh? How do you mean? He's one of them quiet kinda cats that people just don't mess with. Like that time I was telling you about... Yes. The cat that owned it owed me some bread. Started to get off- the-wall about it. Then he check out Freeman. Just standing there, quiet. Diggin' the action. And the cat. Bad. Make two of Freeman. Check out Freeman, look at me, give me my bread. Thought about that that night. He ain't my man or nothing like that, but I know that if I got in trouble, he'd be in it. I think he'd be real bad once he get going, too. What about his sexual habits? Hmm? Do you think he might be homosexual? No. You wasting your time there. What is the guiding principle of an underground guerilla army? To live off the country. To rely on nothing in the way of logistics or supplies which cannot be obtained easily and simply, whether legally or illegally. What happens in an underground organization when the first or second in command are killed or captured? Each man is trained to handle positions three steps ahead of him in grade. The Operations Officer takes over and the others move up two grades. That's fine. That concludes our oral examination and let me congratulate you on being the first Negro officer in the Central Intelligence Agency. We've programmed your aptitudes into our computer personnel system. You are to be our new Top Secret Reproductions Center Section Chief. Hey. Oh. Hi Doris! What brings you all the way down here to the third sub-basement? The general needs someone to give a guided tour for a bunch of senators. You think you can handle it? Yeah. Yeah I think I can handle that. - Good. Senators are in the general's office now. - Okay. Freeman, you don't like me do you? What makes you say that? You never seem very friendly when you bring Top Secret documents to the office. Sometimes it seems like you don't even know I'm around. Oh, it's just that I'm preoccupied with my duties. I just wanna make good here, that's all. You're very ambitious, aren't you? Yeah. I wanna be the best Reproductions Section Chief they've ever had. But you are! Everyone says you're doing much better than expected. Well, I certainly hope so. Gentlemen, our Mr. Freeman. He'll conduct your tour. Senator Barton, Senator Chambers, Senator Wilson. How do you do sir? - Right this way, gentlemen. General, I'm delighted. A member of your personal staff already! Now that's integration in action! You know that's not a bad idea; put him on my personal staff. If he doesn't bungle this tour, we'll keep him up here. Yes sir, we can put him out in reception. All our visitors could see we're integrated. I'm not coming back to Washington anymore, Dan. I'm getting married. [Freeman sighs] The doctor or the lawyer? The doctor. Well... he seems like a nice cat. Dan, I'm sorry, but I'm not getting any younger. And I'm not in your bag. Right. I always knew it had to happen someday. It's alright, baby. Baby. Joy, let's say goodbye right. [footsteps echoing] Dan, I am certainly pleased with the way you're fitting into the Agency. How long have you been with us now? A bit more than five years, sir. And you've done well. You're a credit to your race. Thank you, sir. Hard work, Dan. No shortcuts. Other minorities have pulled themselves up by their bootstraps. Yes, sir. You're a perfect example, Dan. A fine natural athlete. Well no denying, your people are great in sports! Well, thank you sir, but we still have a long way to go. Right. There's still a cultural gap to be closed. It's a question of evolution. Of course it'll take generations. In the meantime, you people must earn respect by serving the country. Freeman, you people must serve. [distant footsteps echoing] General, I want to serve. - I don't understand. Your comments last Friday afternoon convinced me I can make a real contribution. So I'm going back to Chicago to work with my people and show them the way. Don't be hasty, Freeman! Perhaps you should think this thing over. After all, you do set an example for your people to follow. I realize that general, and I have thought about it. But I've decided to take this position with the Social Service Foundation and help my people help themselves. Use what I've learned here. Well, I'll be sorry to see you go, man. Take all the time you need to phase out here. Be sure to let us know how things are going in Chicago. Alright sir, I will. Carstairs, bring in Freeman's file. [door opening, Stereo Right] Freeman's leaving us for a do-gooder outfit in Chicago. More money? - What else? Check out this foundation he used to work for. Saturation in-depth security check. And Freeman? He's safe enough. A routine surveillance of the foundation was clean. Phone tap, random and regular checks on his activities and associates. I'll telex the Chicago office today. Dan, we really got our work cut out for us. Some of the baddest young dudes in Chicago, if not the country, are operating right here in our territory. The King Cobras. I used to be a Cobra. [laughter] You? Yeah. They used to call me Turk. That gang goes back about thirty years. Listen, do they still hang out down at that, what is it, Pete's? Yeah you can find them there any night. Except now they own the place. Hello Mrs. Duncan. Oh Mr. Freeman, hi. Why don't you join me? Good. That looks good. It is delicious! You oughtta try some. Mrs. Duncan, how's your son Shorty doing? Oh Shorty's doing just fine. He's got a job now. Making good money. In fact he just bought me a color television set. I hear that he's not only running numbers, but pushing drugs. I hear he's hooked. No! He ain't no real junkie; sure he shoots up now and then. I don't think he got no more than about a twenty- or thirty- dollar-a-week habit and that ain't no habit! Well, did you ever think that he could end up in jail? Not unless somebody turned the heat on in the precinct. And then I can't hardly see why they'd be after Shorty, 'cause he ain't into it that much. Did Shorty ever think about finishing at least high school? No. He don't want no part of school. You know how them teachers are. Well, without an education, what's he going to do? Mr. Freeman, you know ain't nothing out there for us but right out there in those streets where Shorty is. How you doin', Shorty? Hey Turk. I just saw your mother inside the restaurant. Yeah I was just on my way down to lay some bread on her. Shorty, the word is on the vine that you're not making your payoff to the cops. That's just a rumor, Turk. You mind if I give you a little advice? Naw, go ahead. Why don't you just quit dealing altogether? Aw man, you know I can't do that Turk; it's survival! You ever stop to think what would happen in these streets if we cut off the flow of drugs altogether? White folks control your neighborhood through drugs, and you dealin'? So what you gonna do now, give me a sermon? No, no. No sermon, Shorty. I just thought I'd ask. This is our table. I been wanting to talk to you. No talk, social worker. You better split. You know who I am? Yeah, flunky. We know who you are. [sigh] Let's go out in the alley. This won't take long. You don't wanna go out there, man. That's the way you wanna go. Right now. Yeah. - Alright. [yelling in pain] Next time, social worker, we'll have us a piece too. Shut up! And listen. The big-time, bad-ass Cobras. Poppin' away at the pigs from the rooftops during the riots last Summer? Oh yeah, I know what you was into. The .22 rifles and pistols did about as much damage as a mosquito to an elephant's ass! What'd you expect to hit from that range, with those weapons, at night? You might as well have thrown the damn pieces at the pigs. You really wanna mess with whitey? I can show you how. [gun clicks] I can show you how. You twist the wires to make contact and throw the switch. C'mon with it! C'mon with it! Bring it on here. Easy. Easy, now. Take your time. Touch it off. Alright, I'll operate the ignition by remote control. [engine starts] Woo! - There ya go! Grab him, bring him back, then you can stab him. Then drop him. [indistinct chatter] Move! Get out! [rapid rifle fire] That's it; keep your elbow up. Put the other elbow underneath your piece. That's it. Lean into it. [rapid gunfire, rifle cocking] [gunfire continues] [gasoline pouring] What's wrong, William? What are we doing messing around like a high school chemistry class? Man, anybody can make explosives like this. Okay William, you go and order us some plastic and detonators from Marshall Field's. [group laughter] Everything on this table can be obtained easily from a drug store, hardware store, or medical supply house. If we get sophisticated equipment we'll use it, but we don't rely on it. We live off the land. We match technology with spontaneity and improvisation. Men against machines. Brains against computers. Now, if you don't think it can work, check out Algeria, Kenya, Korea, and the 'nam. Can ya dig it? I understand, man. That's cool. You find out in the country how difficult range estimation is. But in the city, the problem's simplified. A city block is two hundred fifty yards from North to South. One hundred fifty yards East to West. The lamp posts are a standard thirty yards. So we got our reference points all over. - Right! Since the buildings act as a funnel for the wind, you can fire on zero windage. Now, run it down to the sniper teams and I'll be in my pad all night if you need me. Cool, Turk. - Okay. Joy: How's the new job coming along? Freeman: It's, uh, alright. Alright? The word's out on the grapevine how much money you're making. Well nothin's changed about the gig, except the bread. I used to know you when you thought making money was obscene. Making a contribution was your thing. Well, there's no reason why I can't do both. That's what I used to try to tell you, but you wouldn't listen! Since the War on Poverty, all the social workers are making money. Everyone except the poor. [laughs] Now that's the old Dan. But you have changed. Maybe I should have waited. Well, too late to talk about that now. You already have a husband. Yeah, after a fashion. He goes his way and I go mine. By the way, Dawson's back from California. Dawson? [nightclub chatter] Excuse me. Excuse me. Aw, hey! - How you doin'? Okay! This is Peter Dawson. Alenna, Sylvia. How are ya? - I came down to see ya. I came down to see ya. And we're goin' over to have a drink. Can you get over with us some day? I... - Well, If you can, okay? C'mon, girls. Hey Turk. How come you always offer to pay me back the fifty you owe me when we're about to be stuck up? Because I'm good to you. Trust me. Hey, listen. Man, what a pain in the ass. Okay. What are you havin'? Cognac. So how you been, dummy? [Dawson laughs] Okay. Joy tells me you were in California? Yeah, I conducted a fifteen-week seminar on inner-city riot control. What's that? Well it has to do with the Chicago Police Department's approach to street gangs. [Freeman laughs] And they sent you? Who better? A five-year warlord of the Apaches? Oh yeah, let me tell you! This is an ex-hoodlum turned cop! Here's to old friends rediscovered. And to new ones. Tell me about this new job. The next stage of your training program is to learn how to steal. [group laughter] Yes, sir! I know, you're all experts... ... in stealing from your Black brothers and sisters. Now, you will learn how to steal from the enemy. Remember, a Black man with a mop, tray, or broom in his hand can go damn near anywhere in this country. And a smiling Black man is invisible. The president of Chicago Edison is a collector of pipes. Stud, you will rip off the president's pipes while he is in his office. I wanna talk to you, Willie. The brothers tell me you write. Yeah. Good. We need a propagandist. So you're the Minister of Information. I want you to set up a group and use whoever you want. Thanks. What you want, like, some posters? Music? Poetry? Anything. Just as long as you talk to the people in the language that they understand. I know about six other cats I can use. You know, there's a lot of wasted talent in the Cobras. Good, let's use it. Give me an outline in two weeks? Mm, one week, man. Ain't no problem. Beautiful. I understand you're still registered at the university. Y'know I gotta take a few courses each semester, man. Keep that bread comin' from home. You ever intend to get a degree? [Willie laughs] Y'know what do I need with a status symbol? That's all it is to you? For a Black man in this country, what else is it? You know how my grandmother learned to read? No, how? Along with me. You remember those reading primers? Dick and Jane? When I first got into those books, my grandmother used to wait for me to come home from school so she could help me with my reading and she would follow the whole thing, line for line. One day, I don't know why, I just read a line wrong and I realized she couldn't read. And I went into the bathroom and I locked the door and I cried. And every day after that, I ran home so that my grandmother could help me read. And man, the first time I saw her really read.... Get your education, boy, she used to say. Because that's the only thing the white man can't take away from you. And she was right. Y'know I can't figure you, man. What's to figure? I mean what're you in this for? You want power? You want revenge? What is it? It's simple, Willie. I just want to be free. How about you? So do I, man. And I hate white folks. Hate white folks? This is not about "hate white folks." It's about lovin' freedom enough to die or kill for it if necessary. Now, you gonna need more than hate to sustain you when this thing begins. If you feel that way, you're no good to us, and you're no good to yourself. You ever kill a man, Willie? - No. I have. In Korea. And when you spill a man's guts in the gutter, you see how fast hate disappears unless you like killin', and I don't think you will. Some of the Cobras will. Stud will. Why Stud? Because he's a killer. He doesn't know it yet, but he is. [train passing nearby] I have another job for you, Willie. What's that? We need money. So I have a bank job cased. The only thing about it is I can't have the job connected with the Cobras. How're you gonna do that? We'll use Red Beans, Benny Rooster, Po' Monty, JT, Johnny, and Tom and you lead the team. All the yellow niggers, right? Look man, I am tired of that. I am not "passing" I am Black! Do you hear me, man? Do you understand? I am Black! I'm a nigger, you understand me? I was born Black, I live Black, and I'm gonna die proudly because I'm Black! Because some cracker that knows I'm Black better than you, nigger, is probably gonna put a bullet in the back of my head! Stick-up. Put your hands up. Move. Get on the wall! Get on the wall! Now! Move! Put your hands up! Hands up! [rapid gunfire] [tires squealing] [van engine revs] [tires squealing] [car radio] Chicago Police are seeking six heavily-armed men after a daring daylight robbery today of a Southwest Chicago bank. Bank authorities estimate the theft to be in excess of $300,000. The men have been described by eyewitnesses as six caucasian males between the age of twenty to thirty. Police warn that these men are armed and dangerous. [banter] We played these motherfuckers for a hundred. Recruitment and training group ready? Had their final exams last week. - Transportation set? They make two moves before they reach their final destination. Check for tails along the way, pick up instructions as they go along. Logistics? There'll be five hundred dollars and new identification papers waiting for them when they reach the other end. After that, they live off the streets. And when they get there? Locate and identify a gang like the Cobras. Set up training, a chain of command, organization, and a very tight discipline. And? No junk. Good. I want the men assigned to Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Detroit, New Orleans, and Los Angeles to move out within ten days. Man, they got some bad brothers in New Orleans. You got that right. Stagger the rest of them over the next month. There'll be monthly reports until they make contact and weekly reports after that. Now, if they get busted in a street hassle, they recruit in prison and we replace them. Any questions? Hey. - Hey man! I just got off duty so I just thought I'd stop by. Beautiful, beautiful. Hey Joy! - Hi Pete! How are you? Okay. - How's the family? Oh, just fine, just fine! - Good, good! Hey Freebie, I think my oldest boy's gonna be an athlete. Come on! - Oh yeah man, you remember that move I used to make coming off the baseline? Yeah. Well he's got it, man! Got the head and shoulder fake and everything. I didn't teach him that move. I went to a game the other day and there it was! Reminded me of myself twenty years ago. I'd like to see that. Next time you go to a game, take me along. That's a bet. - Okay. How's Arlene? Uh, just fine. She's back in school at nights and she got her master's last year. Now she's going for a PhD. Any chance of you two getting back together again? I don't think so. It's not easy being the wife of a cop. [clears throat] Say, uh, I hear Jugg's in town. How about us catchin' a set? The three of us, like old times? Hey, I'm sorry, but I have really got to go home. Aw, boo! Hey, we'll make it around next week, okay? Okay. Can't cut her loose, can you? No, and she knows me too well. Okay, have a good time! Mhm. - For me? Yeah. Bye bye. - Bye bye. Talk to you later? - Yeah. Listen, let me get this coat on. We goin' out and maybe we catch two sets. Okay. Then we have a nightcap and a late dinner at the Avenue Mhm. - and then we cut out all this foolin' around and go see these two chicks that I came over to tell you about before I found out that Joy was here! Aw, yes! Splendid. What happens in an underground organization when the first and second in command are either killed or captured? Daddy? Each man is trained to handle positions three steps ahead of him in grade. The Operations Officer moves up and takes command and everyone else moves up two grades. Good. Now, we're almost ready. [Willie] We ain't no junkies. [Freeman] From now on everybody gonna think you are. You put needle marks in your arms, and you keep them fresh and no pig is gonna bust you for the things that we'll be doin' as long as you got those tracks. Alright, yeah! That's really hip, man. During the daytime we be noddin'. Night time, we get out there and do it. We are gonna get our own. - Right on. and stop beggin' for crumbs. - How? What we've got now's a colony, but what we want to create is a new nation. In order to do that, we gotta pay a different kind of dues. Freedom dues. Right on. Now, according to Mr. Charlie, we have never paid any dues. You dig those plantation movies on television? Yeah. Yeah. No chains, no whips. A bunch of happy darkies just waitin' on massa Charlie and his family and diggin' it. - Diggin' it. [group laughter] - Like it's fun! [mimicking a plantation movie] Lordy, lordy, lordy! Is Colonel Beauregard come home from de war? My faithful retainer George, the war is over! ...and we lost. You're not a slave anymore, George! You're free. [group laughter] Free, massa? Is that bad, massa? I go-onna die? You're free, George! You can leave the plantation. I wanna stay wiff you. But I can't pay you, George. The carpetbaggers mortgaged the plantation. Oh don't let that worry you none. Why, I wouldn't know what to do with no money! And don't let that mortuary thing worry you either. Everything's gon' be alright! Bless you George! [mimicking a banjo rendition of "I Wish I Was In Dixie"] George! Sit down, George! - Massa? Massa! Massa! [laughter] Shiiit. You have just played out the American Dream. Yeah. And now we're gonna turn it into a nightmare. [crickets chirping] Come on! [bus engine starts] Open the door! Please open the door! Please open the door! Pigs! Will you open the door? This one's off-duty, lady. Can't you read? Take the next one. Now, let's see what we got. Oh wow, man, what a rip-off! You know this gonna make the headlines. No, it won't hit the papers at all. Might give some other people ideas but this place will be swarming with CIA, and FBI. We go underground? No. They'll be looking for everybody except us. You see, this took brains and guts, which we don't have. Right? [laughter] Move it out. Some of the boys is 1-A for the draft, man. What we gonna do if they get called? Go underground? Yeah. If they can beat it, they should, but we recruit every 'nam vet we can get. Right now I'm trying to recruit Dawson as a double agent. Turk, you really think we can win? In guerilla warfare, the winning is in not losing. When you sleep on the floor, you can't fall out of bed. Then what we trying to do, man? Fight whitey to a standstill. Force him to make a choice between the two things which he seems to dig most of all. There is no way that the United States can police the world and keep us on our ass too unless we cooperate. When we revolt, we reduce it to a simple choice. When whitey finds out he can't make even. The Cobras is ready. What about the other brothers and sisters out there on the streets? Their choice is when we start. If they don't follow our program and turn us into the cops we lose in a week. But if they support us ... - Yeah. ... then it's hit and run, harass and hound, and we can paralyze this country. Yeah, right. Training done started already in nine cities. Five groups is combat ready. Plus us. Right. And by next Summer, we should be able to hit the ten larges urban complexes in the United States. Shiiit! Stop or I'll shoot! [gasps] [telephone ringing] Yeah? Turk, it's Daddy. Yeah? Looks like a riot might start, man. The pigs burned a cat. Who? Shorty Duncan. Yeah, after all the training, looks like this shit's gonna start over a jive-ass pusher. Where? Alley behind the pool hall. Nothing moves 'til I give the word, right? Right. Okay. Where you going? Cops shot a kid. Looks like it could be trouble. Don't get involved, Dan. I gotta go. Don't worry about it. How're things looking? Not good. Could blow any time. Anything we can do to help? Just what you've been doing. Talk to the kids, tell them to cool it. They'll listen to you and Perk. - Hey Perk, what about the kids? Everybody's pretty uptight, Dan. Look, Perk, go down to the drugstore and call up the office. Tell the night girl to round up all of the street workers and get 'em down here quick. Then join me, alright? - You got it, Dan. Wait a minute! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Let me go, man! Let me go! - Wait a minute! Listen to me, what is this gonna do, man? You got a wife who's worried about you. You got a new job and if you get busted you'll lose it. You're one of the few people out here with a job to lose! Man, this has got to stop sometime or somewhere. We ain't animals! Come on, y'all just break it on up. Break it on up! [police loudspeaker] Alright come on! Let's start moving it outta here. Come on, just go home. Go on home. Looks like it's coolin' down. Yeah, I think you're right. I should be able to pull my men out in another hour. [crowd yelling] - Dogs! [dog snarling and barking] Dogs! [indistinct police loudspeaker] [dogs barking] [crowd screaming] Get those dogs outta here! The Captain sent me up here. And I'm telling you to get 'em out; I'm in change! You know how these people feel about dogs! Well, I got my orders. Just move 'em, or I'll kill 'em! [crowd yelling intensifies] [dogs barking] Okay, the dogs [are gone, let's] go home! Come on! Let's go, let's go! It's no good anymore. We're gonna have to move back as soon as I can pull all my men out. Aw man, it was gonna be alright. Okay, let's pull it back! [crowd yelling and screaming] [fists pounding on the car] [punching and bludgeoning] Come on Dan! You know we did the best we could. But shit! Yeah I know, they were on their way home. [crowd] Get outta here! Get outta here! Why did he have to bring his goddamn dogs in here? [crowd yelling and screaming] [punches] [gunshot] [gunshot] [police siren] [gunshots] [crowd yelling] [fire engine siren] [gunshot] [crowd yelling and screaming] [fire engine siren] [police loudspeaker] "Everyone here, please clear the area!" [police siren] [screaming] Get in there! Let him out! Drag him over here! Drag him over here! When do we hit, Turk? Are the boys ready? Been ready. And mood? - Mellow. Primary and secondary targets? - Check 'em twice a day. Weapons? - Oiled and ready. Everything ready. We have to wait. - What for? Stud, who is the man? - Well, you the man. And if they get me? - Do-Daddy is. Then? Me, Pretty Willie, and so on down the line. So... Aw man, we go when you say go. Yeah. I'll check you tonight. Right. [helicopter blades whirring] [indistinct yelling] Pigs! Pigs! Hey I'm not with them, dude! I was standin' there looking. Hey. How long since you been in bed? Not since the riots started. That was three nights ago, man. Yeah I know. I catnap when I can. When the National Guards come in? Late last night. All white. I noticed. The people didn't dig it when they woke up this morning and found out the troops were here. What do you think they'll do? [helicopter overhead] I can't see 'em trying to fight the Army. They didn't mind fighting the police. [police car siren] Yeah. I've never seen 'em like that. Maybe that badge has put distance between you and them. Oh yeah! I forgot! The pigs over here and the people over there... ...and never the twain shall meet, huh? Hey man, I grew up down here too, and I know these people! There were some good people out there in the streets the last few nights. Not just hoodlums like they say in the newspapers. With a scene like this, anybody can get involved. But that's only gonna make it worse! We have to maintain law and order or we might as well be back in the jungles. Daws, the ghetto is the jungle; always has been, you understand? You cannot cage people like animals and not expect them to fight back someday. There's always been an army occupation here, but police badges and uniforms. And you and me? A cop and a social worker, we are keepers of this goddamn zoo! The streets have to be safe. Safe for who? You're here to protect property, not lives. Well that's what it's all about, isn't it? You worked hard to get what you got, didn't ya? And you wanna keep it, just like I do. Bullshit! Listen, you think because you got a badge and I got a couple of degrees that makes a difference? Do you know what white folks call people like you and me in private? Niggers, Daws. Niggers. [whistling] Hey, hey, hey. Haven't heard you talk like that since we were in college. [Freeman sighs] I'm sorry man. Maybe the last three night have been a little bit much. I got a board meeting. I gotta go reassure the white folks. Let's go get something to eat, okay? Okay. [helicopter approaching] [funk music playing] Hey, hey old bean. And you too baby. This is Uncle Tom, Commanding Chief of your Black Freedom Fighters of North America. [radio] Bringin' you the latest news from your fighting Black underground. Hang on, brothers and sisters. Liberation is near. In just a few minutes, at precisely three o'clock, we will demolish the lavish offices of the Mayor of White Chicago. 'Course we don't have a mayor, even if they do count our votes several times to elect him every four years. Remember, brothers: in spite of the lies about an assassination attempt on the mayor, which will appear in the white press, this time, we blew the mayor's office at night when he was at home to announce the beginning of our war of liberation. I'd dedicate this program to the National Guard, but we're fresh outta hillbilly music. According to the press and the television, the Guard spends all its time playing basketball with the kids and helpin' old ladies cross the street. But we know better, don't we? We know about that fourteen year old girl the trigger-happy guardsmen shot last night. And the people they beat up. And the Black businesses they destroyed, don't we? It's almost time. Ten seconds. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. [radio] Three. Two. One. Blast off. And the Mayor's office is now air conditioned. Courtesy of the Black Freedom Fighters of Chicago. The message is this: pigs and the National Guard have to go. Immediately, if not sooner. If they have not left by midnight Sunday, we will kick them out. Whitey, go home! We don't want you in our neighborhood either. And we will control our nation. [electric shock] We will leave when things are back to normal. With them at the bottom and us at the top. Colonel Evans, would you care to comment on charges of brutality by the Guard? If they obeyed the law, we wouldn't be here. They'll get what they asked for. There has been no brutality by the Guard. Colonel, what about the threats by the Freedom Fighters to kick the Guard out of the neighborhood? They said midnight tonight. It is now twelve thirty, which tells us exactly what we think of their threats. It's also time to put an end to this conference; I have a report to work on. Goodnight and thank you, gentlemen. And ladies. [muffled footsteps] [soldier gasps] Hold it right there! You just killed your last white man! - Did he die? My people attack. - You don't scare me none, you snakey Indian! [TV: a cowboy movie—gunfire, war whoops, and horses galloping] Get up! [multiple people laugh] Yeah, the first Black Colonel! Lil' Black Sambo. How you like that? You like that, don't ya? Always wanted to be like that, didn't you? Uh huh! - Yeah. [footsteps] Coffee, tea? - Poison? You're gonna kill me? No, soul brother. Just a little acid. You're going on a little trip. Hold him! Hold him! [gargling] [group laughter] [humming a tune] Men, how are ya? I just met the most marvelous bunch of niggers! [laughs] The most marvelous bunch... [gunshot] You get him? Shiiit! [large truck engine] Come out! [rapid gunfire] Move! [loudspeaker] We need two people over in this area, please. Hurry! [TV news reporter] Due to increased fighting in Chicago, the President has ordered a brigade from the 82nd Airborne into the war-torn South Side to reinforce the beleagured National Guard, under heavy attack by Black guerillas since late last week. This is Pat Bennell, Chicago. You've been here since the beginning, Carstairs. How does it look to you? General, it couldn't be worse. - We have elite troops out here now, against untrained Black fanatics. The whole thing should be over before the weekend. Those troops are facing a highly-trained underground guerilla army. They had military weapons and they know how to use them. The commander of those elite troops insists he can put this thing down within a few days. You disagree? Yes sir, I do. They're a first-class fighting unit. You've prepared an options book? Yes sir. - And? We have three: root them out one-by-one, starve them out by seige, or total evacuation of the Black population. Evacuation. The first is too costly in lives and equipment, and neither evacuation nor seige would work. Why not? General, we sealed off the ghetto for three days last week. It paralyzed the city. Paralyzed Chicago? Chicago is more dependant on Black labor than one would think. 90% of the garbage collectors are colored. 60% of the hospital workers are colored. 60% of the bus drivers and 80% of the postal workers. So, although the concentration... ...the detention camps occurring under the 1950 Subversion Act are ready, we can't put them to immediate use. Your recommendation? We can end it alone, sir. Yes? The Russians obviously have a top agitprop man here. Find him, destroy him, and you have disorganized, ignorant Negroes to deal with. Cut off the head and the snake dies. Exactly. Alright Carstairs, get right on it. I'm going back to Washington. Get back to me by tomorrow noon. Honey, I'm going back to Washington. Why don't you amuse yourself here for a few days? A little shopping. Be back Sunday, eh? Sure, baby. I can find something to do in Chicago. But how'd you know how to find me? I looked in the phone book. Ah. Yeah well, you look great! What are you doing in Chicago? I'm here with my sponsor. I'm not hustling anymore. Got me a steady scene. He a little bit, um, freakish... like Black skin, but the money's good. Got me some property. You know him. I do? Yeah. You used to work for him. You know, you were his nigger? All the time he'd be sayin' if all of us niggers was like you, wouldn't be no trouble. At first, I thought he was talkin' about somebody else. So... So they out to get Uncle Tom. What makes you think I know anything about, uh, Uncle Tom? I'm not sayin' you do, but you know Chicago and I don't. Yeah, but what am I supposed to do? Warn him. Tell him they out to kick ass and they ain't playin'. One thing. Why you stickin' your neck out? I'm Black, ain't I? Yeah. Yeah you are, baby. Who's in charge? Carstairs. What are they up to? They plan to get inside, find out who this Uncle Tom is, and kill him. Cut off the head, and the snake dies. Do they know who Uncle Tom is? They think he's some guy from Russia. They would. You want me to see what else I can find out? No. Wait a minute. Two can play at this infiltration game. Find out all you can, but don't pry. I'll have somebody contact you in Washington. Baby, be very careful. And don't contact me again unless I get to Washington. [groans] Why me? Why me? 'cause it's war, honky. [police siren] Split! [police siren] And why should you feel threatened by the Freedom Fighters? Because I am, and you are too! - How? You know how! Look, all the progress we've made over the last few years will be wiped out if this thing isn't stopped soon. I heard even your foundation is on its way out. Well, no. They decided to increase the budget and the staff. Yeah? - Uh huh. Well, my husband was dismissed from the hospital. And he was the first and only Negro on a white hospital staff in this city. What is the connection between your husband and the Freedom Fighters? Dan, that is the whole point! Innocent and decent people are suffering because of niggers who know nothing but hate and revenge. And it's all the niggers' fault, right? - Don't romanticize those people, Dan. They're not beautiful! - Only by contrast. Dan, those Freedom Fighters are murderers! Hey listen, it didn't figure to be long before those niggers realized that you don't have no win throwin' a brick at somebody with a gun! Dan, whose side are you on? Your side. We're in the same bag, making the best of a bad scene. I think he's mixed up with those... Black Freedom Fighters. Dan? You gotta be kiddin'. I am sure of it. We were talking and he just... ...for a minute he was like he used to be. Yeah? He was somethin' else when he was in college. And that was before all this became fashionable. He was defending those... animals. But then he caught himself. He said all the right things, but it just wasn't him. Just wasn't the man I know. Perfect source of intelligence. Gig takes him all over the ghetto. I'll check it out. Pete, I am doing doing the right thing? Come on. Just put your coat down right there. Come on. [Laughing] What is this, Daws? Come on, Uncle Tom. Come on! Uncle what? Uncle Tom. Up against the wall. Come on! Against the wall. Spread your feet out. Come on. Hey, easy. What is this, some kind of joke, man? Yeah. It's a joke. The joke is on me! I been lookin' all over for Uncle Tom and here you are under my nose! Cool Dan Freeman. Hey, baby. Only diggin' sports cars and bread. Good clothes and chicks. Beautiful cover, man. Hey man, think about it. I mean really think about it. Now, would I risk all of this for that? Yeah well, I don't have to worry about that, man. I got enough evidence to take you in and that's what I'm gonna do. What evidence? Them tapes, man. Them Uncle Tom propaganda tapes that you cats spread around the ghetto, well I listened to 'em! Over and over again! And it's you, Dan. It's your voice. You gotta be crazy. We'll see if a voiceprint proves whether I'm crazy or not. Now what? - Now what? Well, the scene is over. But, one thing. One thing. Are you workin' with the commies like they say? Who's behind you? How come there gotta be somebody behind me? Oh, come on, man, don't put me on. No, no. The FBI says it's the most sophisticated underground movement in the Western hemisphere. The work of an expert! Uh huh, and expertise is a white man's monopoly, right Daws? Well, I am an expert! I spent five years flunkying to become an expert. This gun makes me an expert. You're a big man with that gun and that badge. You know, Daws, you wanna have it both ways. You want a pat on your head from whitey and you want to love and respect your people. But you can't be with your people without betrayin' that badge. And you can't be a cop without betraying your people, you hypocrite. You think nobody else feels the way you do? You think you're the only nigger with a sense of outrage? Well, then hit back! Join us! We can use you. We got undercover people on the force. On the force? That's right. - Who? Nobody with your rank. Come on, join us, Daws. You were using kids! Who else am I gonna involve, people like you and me? Nah, the kids are our only hope. And I got to them before they got jailed or killed or turned into Dawsons. And now they'll do anything to be free. Who said you were free, man? Well, Daws, even on the wrong end of your gun, I'm a lot freer than you are. [Dawson yells] [gunshot] It's Dawson! Hey, man. Dawson's your main man. Y'know, that'd be like me killing Daddy. Yeah. Maybe one day you'll have to kill Daddy. Or him you. You think we playin' games killin' white strangers? There are a lot of Dawsons out there, and some of them will try to stop us. But anybody who gets between us and freedom has got to go. Now, that's anybody! You got the Airborne out there now, and 40% of those troops are Black. Maybe they'll help us, and maybe they won't. But in the meantime, if you hesitate with any one of them because he's Black, just once! You'll be one dead Cobra. Now, if you ain't ready to pay them kind of dues, you get out and go back to doin' nothin', but... ...don't tell me who I killed, and what it cost me to do it. Now, get him outta here. Get him out. - Right, Turk. It is now Condition Red. All fighters in the field. Alert our groups everywhere. And remember, don't quit until you either win, or you die. [news reporter] This newest outbreak in the Black section of Oakland brings to a total of eight, the number of uprisings by Black guerillas in cities across the nation. The President has declared a state of national emergency.
