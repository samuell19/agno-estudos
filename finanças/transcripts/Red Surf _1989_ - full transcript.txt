Beautiful evening here in the South Bay, Santa Ana winds blowing in. Hope you're cuddled with someone you love. As far as tomorrow's surfing goes, we're talking smooth and glassy all the way down to Mexico, with swells from one to two feet. So you know what that means, dudes. Let love close, stay out late and party. Check it out. There she is, that bitch. Did you see who she's with? Jason. That's his car. Yeah, you know, she was with him at Walker's Cafe last night. I should kick his ass. You wanna kick his ass? I should kick his ass. Let's kick his ass. No, wait. Let's fuck with him. You wanna fuck with him? Yeah, let's fuck with him. Let's fuck with him. All right. What the hell is she doing with a guy like that? Well, she was with you. That guy's a fag. Actually, he's kinda a nice guy. I kinda like him. What? I got no brakes. Son of a bitch. I got no brakes. Don't fuck with me. I'm not fucking with you. Hit the brakes, my God. Bail. What? Bail. Amber! Amber, Amber, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Come here. You're my hero. Give us a kiss. Oh, my God. Hey, fag! I knew it. I had it. No, no, I'm calling it. You totally bought it. It was beautiful. I didn't buy it. I saw your face, you thought you killed her. All right, all right, you had me. All right, I bought it, okay? But that looked just like the guy's car. It was his car! Oh, no! And his guitar was in the backseat! Give me that. Oh, for Rebecca? Yeah, let's go. Oh, my. Excuse me. Hey, guys, what about my car? Well, pull it outta there. You pull it outta there, it was your gag. We could do it tomorrow. My mom's gonna be so pissed. Hey, wise guy, where's Attila? Um, didn't the hospital call you? They're pulling a gerbil out of his ass. Jerk. Very funny. No, I'm joking with that. I think he went out with one of those ex-strippers that he used to like a lot, Daphne. Oh, come on, give us a Kiss. Ugh. Blue, Blue, have you seen Mark? He didn't call you? - No. - He went to jail. Serious to God, I believe he went to jail. I'm joking, I'm joking, I'm joking. I think he's out with a girl, he went out with a stripper. Hey, baby, what's happening? Whoa. Wait 'til he finds his car. Dude, I'm so wasted. Do you have any coke on you? I'll pay you back, I swear to God. Slow down, all right. Yeah. Okay, we're going on a run tonight, okay? Right. All right, I'm ready. Do me like the dog I am. Anytime. Yeah, but... Yeah. Listen, yeah, I'll call you later, okay? Yeah. Okay, all right, bye. Hi, babe. You're late. I'm late. What's wrong? You guys couldn't decide what liquor store to hit? It's getting kinda chilly in here. Who was that? Nobody. Nobody. All right. Well, I get any messages? Why don't you check the machine, Mark? Oh, what's that? It's a guitar. Oh, I see, so you decided to knock off a music store instead, huh? No, we were 100 busy burning down a homeless shelter. Listen, Rebecca, this guy owed me money, okay? So he gave me this guitar, and I knew that you wanted a new guitar. So this is my present to you. I'm sorry. It's okay. I've just been in a really weird mood lately. So, did you miss me? Nope. Not even just like a little? Nope. So I guess a blowjob would be outta the question. Yeah. Stella? Hey, Lou. Hey, hey. No? Oh, ho ho. I'm going out on a run tonight and I might not come back. What do you mean? You think it's dangerous? No, I just may never come back. You. Come here. I just got all this built-up tension. Tension? Yeah. And I'm thinking I'd be a lot safer out there if I were relieved of that tension. You want a quaalude here? Here, take a quaalude. Take a whole bunch of them. Here. Oh. Go for it. I could never get a girl to do that with me. I need to get away. Where do you wanna go? You wanna go to Mexico? We'll get one of those $40 a night villas down on the beach. Yeah, anywhere, Mark. Mark, I need... I need to be alone with you. I just need to be alone, because I need to talk to you about some things. It's not really important. Hey, hey, yeah. Okay. Okay. Uh-huh. Okay, yeah. Got it. Thank you. Later. Yes. Han! Oh, man. Mm. I'm sorry. Where do you wanna go? Forget it. I tell you what, you name it, all right, and we'll go anywhere you want. We'll go to Paris, we'll go to Tahiti, just name it. Mark, forget it. Really, it's nothing. We haven't been spending enough time alone, that's it. That's what's wrong. That's why you've been mad at me? Mark, listen, I... Hey, no, no, listen. You know, I've been spending too much time with the guys, you know, and it's not fair to you. And I'm gonna change that. All right? It's just that things are kinda hot right now. I Know, you don't dig what I'm doing here, but believe me, it's gonna pay off so good. Let's stay in tonight. Or go to the movies or something like that. Just you and I, alone. Okay? I'll tell you what we'll do, okay? Listen. Listen to me. We'll go to that Italian restaurant. You know, the one that you like. All right, with those... Violins. Right. And we'll drink red wine and we'll get, you know, totally shit-faced. And we'll stay out all night, all right? Okay. Come here. Now wait, listen to me. Okay, listen. We're gonna do this tomorrow night, okay? Hey, hey. I gotta go. You look beautiful. I gotta go. All right, all right, bye. So we're outta here, right? Yeah, the deal's on. All right.

Yeah, well, these babies just came in today, but look, they haven't been pain'ted, they haven't been tested. The serial numbers are too hot and they're too loud! Perfect, just the way I like it. Bullshit, perfect. I can't fix these babies in a day. Besides, I gotta get to work tonight. What are you talking about work? It's volunteer. Nobody's paying you. Doc likes being a candy striper back in the emergency room. Hey, look, I was a medic back in the last war. Would that be Vietnam? Yeah, that would be Vietnam. Listen, Doc, Rudy said midnight, so let's do this, huh? You haven't heard a word I been saying, huh? We're not going out tonight. Doc, we're gonna safe out there. We're gonna be 100% safe. Oh yeah, we're gonna be safe. There shouldn't be any scuba gooks out in the seaweed tonight. Shut the fuck up! Doc, let's do this, huh? Let's do it. This is funny, seriously. This one's funny. Come on, this guy is called down to the hospital. He thinks his wife is dead. I'm not telling it now. No one ever listens. You know exactly what to do, right? I want three distinct groups. I know. I got Blue. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you got it. 1 got it all. I got everything, all right. I want you to keep your ass back in the seat. Otherwise, you're gonna flip it over. I know.

You promised you wouldn't get it in my face, man. Leave it there, it looks good on you. Calavera's gonna love to see you wear his merchandise. Here, finish this up. Hey, Highway Patrol. Oh, shit. That shit was not funny, man. Hey, it adds to the excitement. Nice neighborhood. Uh-oh, look at this one. Say, brother. Oh, jeez. We're dead. Get outta here, man! Come on, asshole, get outta the car. Why don't you learn how to fucking drive? You fucked up my car, asshole! I got this one. You get the guy in the fucking car. Fuck you. No, it's cool. Hold on. Fuck you, asshole. Fuck you, it's cool. Look what you fucking did to my car. No, no, no, no. Cool down, cool down. Fuck you, beef hole. Come on. Come on, asshole, get outta the car! I'll get outta the fucking... You wanna fuck with me?

Let's go. You just tell me... whose idea it was to steal from me. Okay, okay, I'll tell you. Big vato named Geronimo. He pulled me in a car. He put a gun in my mouth and he say he shoot me if we don't steal this shit for him. He say he kill me. That is the truth, I swear to God. I swear to God. Manuel, sit down. Now, Flaco has just told me what happened today. Now you tell me what happened today. Please, don't lie to me. Okay. Yesterday... we found out that the boat... that the boat was coming with coca. We knew that the Jeep was coming today. I'm the one who told Flaco. You see? The truth is so simple. Flaco, what did he say? Shh. Go, Eliseo, clean off your face. Forgive me. I'll leave you here with Bullet. Hey, my friends! My friends! Amigos! My friends! Come on. Oh, what an unexpected pleasure. So much bullshit for today, I apologize. But don't think too much about it. For you, the barrio is always safe. Sit down. To long life and good business. You know, stealing I understand. But lying to me, I don't know. Shows no respect. That I can't forgive. So let's see it. You got it. Looks good before I cut it. After that, turn 10 kilos into 40 kilos. Rock cocaine. Shit. This stuff is very good. The quality is nice. We both make money and business is good. Listen, Cal, how do you feel about taking on a bigger load? You know, upping the stakes a bit? Expand the business. How much? I was thinking around 50 kilo. Can you handle that? Better question is, can you handle that? Let me think about it. I trust you. You do good work, you're honest. Let me think about it. Come with me, I'd like to show you something. Let's go. Let me tell you a little story. Flaco will play Little Red Riding Hood. They'll play the Big, Bad Wolf. Bullet's idea. But I don't think he feeds them enough. Goodbye, my friends. Bullet, pay them. For your troubles. Bullet,. Wolves? Barrio business, man. Hey, this shit ain't worth getting killed over. Hey, listen, you're not dead yet. What do you wanna do? You wanna quit? Sounds good to me.

Yeah, and we get the fuck outta dodge. How you doing? That's a nice net you got on you. Are you 217 Yeah. You swear to God you're 21 years old? I swear. Hey, com padre, you got a cigarette on you, man? Listen, do you see me sitting here with somebody? Do I look like I'm smoking? Now there's 10,000 other people around here smoking. Find one of them. Hey, man, I'm sorry, man. You know what I'm saying? Just get away from me. Hey. Coming up to me asking me for a cigarette. Are you here with somebody, you sure? Swear to God you're not. Hey, just a cigarette, man. You got one? I mean, you got a pack right there. This is the second time I'm gonna tell you. Next time, I'm gonna get up, I'm gonna throw your ass outta here. Now get away from me. Go. I'm sure he's here somewhere. Where is he? I don't wanna get my ass kicked, you understand. I'm a businessman. Right? I have some drugs in here. Drugs and pretty girls go together. Sounds like fun. Want a drink? Another vodka for me, please. What do you think this is worth? Ask her. No way to know unless you ask. How much is this? Attila, please, it's art. It's expensive, Mark. It's art. It's expensive. I'm kidding. Please, please, come here. No, no, no, come here, come here. Let's get ourselves... No, no champagne, that's not quite for me. Becca, why don't you have a little white wine? No, I really don't want any. Here, no, it's fine, it's good. It's good stuff. I really don't. I'm not in the mood tonight. Take the wine. - Honey, I don't... - Take the wine. All right, thank you. Now, you're just a... you're a boatload of laughs tonight. Oh, really? I'm incredibly embarrassed to be with you tonight. Do you know that? I'm embarrassing you? Yes, you are. Do you know anywhere, maybe, we could kinda go do some blow? Follow me, we can go upstairs. Come on. Won't your girlfriend get mad? Yeah. I would. Hi. You gonna drink that champagne all night? Because I have a personal friend named Johnnie Walker. What's your name? Suzie. Hi, Suzie.

Just relax, dude, okay? You're too loud, you're loud. Until you learn how to do this right, we're not gonna do it, I swear to God. Hey, hey, hey, you got a cigarette, man? Listen, will you get the fuck outta here for the last time? What's going on here? What's...? Come on, stop with this shit. Come on, shithead. I'll read you your rights in the car. You limey little faggot! You motherfucker! You got it, right? Fuck you! Get your fucking hands off me! Fuck you, fuck you! Fuck you, you motherfucker! Fuck off! That's it, I'm clear now, right? You motherfucker! Goddamn you, son of a bitch! I'll fucking... Where have you been? I'm sorry. I went to Carmen's and we started talking, and it got late, so I just spent the night. What were you talking about? I don't know. Nothing, everything. Were you talking about this? Why didn't you tell me? I tried to. I... I don't know. I just found out. All right, okay, what are we gonna do? I want this baby, Mark. Yeah. I know that a child's not in your future plans and everything, but I cannot go through what I went through before. I just, I can't. And I won't. Oh, uh. No, I know. You know, I just, I wish you would a told me. Okay. So, what are we gonna do? Well, I can't stay here. We'll get an apartment. You know, we'll move someplace. No, I can't be with all the drugs. I found a gun the other day, Mark. I can't be with the drugs, I just can't. Not with a baby. No, I won't. Well, what are you saying? I'm going to Portland. Oh, hey, all right. Great, you know. You're gonna go to Portland. What the fuck for? I have a friend there. Jackie. She's got two kids. Great, okay, that's terrific. What are you gonna do, send a postcard? You know, say, hey, "Dear Mark, rains a lot up here. You know, your kid looks just like you. Send money. Love, Rebecca. ” I mean, come on, he's my kid, too. Yeah, but Mark, you know, you're not gonna change. It's just the same... Hey, hey, hey, things are different, okay? I mean, I'm not gonna do this my whole life. And I was talking to Attila about that yesterday. About what? About, you know, getting the hell out. You know, quitting, settling down. The whole thing, just ending it. Come here, come here. I'm gonna talk to Doc, you know, and I gotta straighten some stuff out. And, you know, it's gonna take some time, but I can do it. Wonder what he's doing in there. Excuse me. He? He? How do you know it's gonna be a he? Huh? Because I'm such a man. Oh, I see. I love you. I love you, too. I'm starving. You hungry? Yes. Good. Don't get fat or anything. Hey. Yes? You got the file on this kid I picked up at the club? Yeah, right here. Not a whole lot. One small thing from last year. It isn't important. Unbelievable. Oh, no, not again. Attila, it's bad enough last night, you know, he makes a big scene at the art gallery and then this morning, at 7-00 AM, he's just sitting there smoking rock. That's not new. You pissed because he didn't share with you or what? Attila, you don't understand. I'm pregnant. You and Remar? You're pregnant? All right. That is bitchin'. That is so cool. All right, let's go get some champagne and cigars, and go find some fun. Thank you. You're welcome. You know... Attila is a great name for a kid, boy or a girl. You think so, huh? Yeah. Even a hermaphrodite. What's the story here, man? We just got paid for this junk. You gonna take all day on it? They want it done by three. What's the story? Jerry! Jerry, you old dog. When they bust you outta prison, man? Attila, how the hell are you, man? How've you been? I've been great. Hey, this here, this is Rebecca. Nice to meet you. Pretty lady. You always had good taste in women. Oh, no. You're not looking too bad your own damn self. Come back to the old job and suck my dick. Man, I'm gonna finally fix up that '67 I got. Oh no, why don't you just sell it to me? Bullshit. Hey, hey, Vickie, look who's here. Check this out. Maria. Tequila, please. Coming. Ah. You may have that. Ah, and you may have that. And you may bring me another one. You gotta be kidding me. Whew. Okay, kid. I get off work in half an hour. Let's give it one more try. Make any friends yet? I don't feel good. I thought I was supposed to be able to call a lawyer or something. Well, you're not here to think, shithead. Lawyer wouldn't do you any good, anyway. You haven't been charged yet. But you're gonna be charged. For possession. Almost half an ounce of coke, a bag of fucking pills and an unregistered handgun, asshole. And I got half a dozen witnesses in that shithole happy to go to court, because they owe me their ass. Just like you gonna owe me yours. You wanna play? I can wait. I'm back on in 14 hours. Usually have dinner around midnight. I'll look in on you then. Son, you are in some serious fucking trouble. I can make you out to be whatever the fuck I want to in court. That handgun makes you a serious criminal, not some petty drug dealer. Any judge in this county would put your white ass away for five to 10. Probably Chino, not some work farm. Pretty white boy like you, hell, you'll be married in no time. That's right, five to 10! But who knows? You just may be a faggot. And like three pounds of nigger dick up your ass. You ain't nothing but a street punk. You're not smart enough to really be a player. And I don't want your candy ass in here any more than you do, you understand? Not as dumb as you look after all. Name? Name! Okay, all right. Would you rather... Would you rather? Have a spool of barbed wire strung up your colon, the whole spool. All right. - Or? - Or? Would you rather slide down a banister of razor blades, naked? Give me the barbed wire. Let me die with my dick. Remar. Dude, you're blowing it with Rebecca. Well, you know, I've done it before. I'll get her another guitar. Ooh. Hey, I'm serious, man. She's pregnant. I don't know, hey. I'm happy, and I'm excited, proud. It's just that... it's not something I planned, you know, and, um, and I don't feel like I'm in control of my own life. I think it'll be cool, man. Think about this. You and Rebecca and the kid, it'll be great, it'll be just like family, man. I always wanted a family, you know. Closest thing I ever got to a family is you. Dad. Well, Junior, let me tell you about family. All right, you get yourself a kid, right? Yeah. And the first year, you worry if it's gonna live or not. But it does. And then something funny happens. It starts to hate you. And it hates you, and it hates you until the day you die, and there's nothing you can do about it. Hey, man, let me tell you about family. Go ahead. Coming from a guy who's never had one, all right. I had to make my own. I mean, you know, you and Rebecca and Blue. I guaran-goddamn-tee you, I'd be dead by now if it weren't for that. You're gonna be a great father. I mean, it'll be cool. Your kid's... it'll be great. Your Kid's gonna wanna party with you. Oh, yeah. "Hey, Junior, get on out to the garage, clean it up, I'll give you some blow. You can sell it to your friends." What are you looking for? My shit. I got a gram somewhere. You're doing too much of that shit, man. Hey, fuck you. All right, not from you. Not you. Want a hit? Not from you. Release the kid. Welcome home, home boys. I been expecting you. Your rooms are ready and everything. You have the right to do whatever the fuck I tell you to do, when I tell you to do it. Any questions? Hey, white boy. Shut up, fuckhead. I own your ass. Yeah, yeah, right. Five to 10 in Chino, right, Holmes? Hey, this time, be the flower girl at my wedding, man, all right? Please. Get them outta here. Mark, honey? Mark? A till a, have you seen Mark? No, not since last night. Goddammit, we were supposed to leave by 8:30. Hey, come on, Becc. Give it a rest. Oh, give it a rest? We have a nine o'clock doctor's appointment and now I have to go alone. Oh shit. The doctor? Yeah. Oh, no, no, Remar told me to take you to the doctor. I'm sorry, I'll just be a minute. No, it's not gonna work this time. I'm serious, I gotta take you to the doctor. He'll kill me. No, look, you're busy. I'm just gonna take the bus. No, no, no, no, no, no, you can't take the bus. You ever seen the kinda people who take the bus? You'll scare the kid. Come on, just give me a minute. Okay. Okay, thanks. Does this look all right? Do I have to change or anything? No, you look fine. I don't know why this has to be so complicated. Come on, Becc. Remar just likes to do things his own way. No, Remar likes to do his drug deals his own way. Hey, he's not doing any more deals. Oh, really? Yeah. I got it all worked out. I been talking to Doc. We're all getting out. Just like that? Yeah. Swear to God. So what are you gonna do after? I'm taking my share and investing in Jerry's bike shop. Work on nothing but vintage Harleys. I'll run off with Amber and have a bunch a kids. Can I ask you a question? Sure. Why her? Amber? Yeah, Amber. She keeps her mouth shut most of the time. Got nice tits. She's not too bright, you know, which is perfect for me. Yeah, she is too good for you. You remember Biker Jerry? Yeah. Well, he and I used to bust into this drugstore and steal Percodans, put about a dozen of them in a bottle of Wild Turkey and guzzle that sucker down, go up PCH and about Ventura, race on the freeway. Going the wrong way at night. Lights coming at you made it a little more exciting. My God, I'm surprised you're still alive. Yeah, me too. Not the smartest thing I ever did. That was about the time I met Remar. Jesus, girl, we were crazy mothers. I mean, we would do any shit to get us high. That shit's long gone, man. That's over. It's over. No more. God. Hey, put your seat belt on. Oh, God, please, give me a break. No, I'm serious. That kid's just forming itself right now. Some asshole comes through here and hits us, you know, you can kiss little A goodbye. God, why is it all you guys think it's gonna be a boy? Huh? I mean, what if it's a little girl? And so what if it is? What if it is, what, are you gonna be, like, a difficult mother? Not gonna let her play ball? Okay, okay, I will. But you have to put yours on, too. No, no, no, no. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This rule doesn't go for uncles. I think it does, Attila. No. Well, what if something happens to Uncle Attila? I mean, who's gonna take her to practice, hm? All right, okay, fair is fair. Don't tell anybody, all right? All right. Jesus. So what are you saying? What do you want me to do? Get a job. What's the big deal, huh? Rebecca wants to go to Portland. All right, that takes money. I can't make that kinda money swinging a fucking hammer. Get back on the circuit. You're better than these fucking kids. You can wipe the floor with them. Doc, I just wiped out on a fucking pussy wave! All right, now, I got a commitment and I'm gonna stick to it. You know, you're not listening to me. I didn't say don't do the deal. Let Attila and the others get out there. No, I need the money, okay? I guarantee you they would fuck it up. This is my ticket outta here. Rebecca and that kid is your ticket outta here. Hey, besides, lots a folks raise families without dealing drugs. What's up? Nothing. All right, I got up before you did. What's the problem? And you went surfing. Right. That's the problem, Mark. You know, we had a doctor's appointment this morning and you go surfing. I mean, how am I supposed to feel? That was today. I'm, sh... God, I'm sorry. Don't I at least get an excuse? I don't get that much? I mean, come on, you're the master of excuses. Give me your best shot. You know, I guess I thought it was tomorrow. Well, it wasn't. It was today. And you had to go by yourself. No, I didn't. Attila took me. I'm surprised he was even awake. Well, at least he was there. Yeah. Lot more than you were. She's right here. Now, the marine band radio and the police band radio, we won't have that Coast Guard bullshit this time. We got all that stuff easy, without the bullshit, man, and I'm talking $100,000. Maria, two more of these and two more of these, please. Not for me. Fuck it, then bring me two of each. Did you hear me? You hear what I said? I said $100,000. $100,0007 $100,000. Woo! All right, I gotta talk to Calavera. We gotta set this thing up. I gotta get a hold of Doc. He's gotta get Rudy. Nope, nope, done deal. It's done. And the beauty of this is that you get $75,000 for you, you and Rebecca. What do you mean? What do you mean it's a done deal? You talked to Calavera? Yeah. What the fuck's going on? You didn't fucking hear me. Did you hear me? You didn't hear me. I just said you get $75,000. Yeah I know, it's just, I mean, what am I supposed to do, drive the fucking getaway car? No, Doc's gonna drive the Jeep, man. You got this all figured out, huh? Yeah. Doc's in on this, too? Everybody, Remar. Everybody's fucking in on this. What's your problem, man? Life working out too good for you or what? No, see, it's just that, you know, I don't know what the fuck's going on. I'm the one who fucking put this fucking deal together in the first place. Okay, calm down, Remar. You can't be going out on runs anymore, man. What if you get busted, huh? What about Rebecca? What's she gonna do, right? No, like you said, one last deal. Okay? You don't wanna be out there, Remar. Let me tell you something. Not you, okay? And not Doc and not Rebecca. Nobody's gonna fucking tell me what to do. All right? I am in charge of my own fucking life! Nobody's gonna fucking tell me what to do! Nobody's telling you. I am fucking serious! Okay. Come on, let's go. Yeah. All right, let's go. Let's go, buddy. Come on, friend. You talk to fucking Calavera, and you talk to Rudy, you talk to Doc, you been doing a lotta fucking talking. I'm surprised you didn't have a conversation with Rebecca, too. Slow down, Remar! No, man, speed up, all right! Now stay with me here, okay. You put together a $100,000 deal with people that I set up, and I'm supposed to stay home and watch fucking TV? Fuck you! You have no fucking idea how hard it was for me to put this together. Yeah, but this was a gift to you! Aw, thanks, man. Thank you. Now you're giving me fucking gifts? Fuck you. I ain't fucking listening. Yeah, well it's a good thing you're here to save my sorry ass, huh? You're really starting to piss me off. I was doing this for you. Fuck you! Fuck... fuck you, man! Hey, fuck off! Get him over here! Get your fucking hands off of me! What the fuck is going on? Sit down! If you walk outta here, it's because I let you. All business between us is finished. You fucked with my barrio. Today, I lose a safe house, $250,000 cash and three men in jail because of you. What the fuck are you talking about? Don't play bullshit with me! You're in my house. One of your men talked. Talked to the police. They came looking for me. Knew my name. Busted the house. Threw my men in jail. Now my brother is with them in jail. How the fuck do you know it was one of my men? He's your man. You call him True Blue. True Blue. That's a stupid name. But I'll take care of him. And our deal is off. - Wait a fucking minute. - Come on. Shut up! I'll kill you, man. Get that gun outta my face! Stay out of it, Bullet! Stay out of it! All right, all right, now where are you gonna find shit as good as what I get you? No place. All right, nobody is dead yet. You lost some cash and your brother's in jail. Fuck it. He'll be out tomorrow. But as far as my men go, I'll take care of my business and you take care of yours. This is my barrio. This is my business. See, this is my business and this is my deal. He's dead. That's justice. Bullshit! He's one of my men and I take care of him. I want him dead! You'll get him fucking dead, all right? But we still have a deal! I wanna hear it from his mouth, all right. I wanna hear him say it. And then I will fucking kill him myself, but we still do business. And it's a lotta money. It's business, man. Okay. But I want justice by morning, or else no more deals. I come looking for you and I don't fuck around next time. All right, he fucked up and that's it. It's strictly business. Strictly business? And who the hell are you, the Godfather? Hey, why don't we wait and ask Blue what happened? I know what happened. He almost got us fucking busted and he almost got us killed. Jesus Christ, Remar, this guy's our friend. Bullshit. Are you hearing yourself? Did you hear what you're saying? What I'm saying is that he is a born fuck-up, and I am not, I am not gonna let him fuck this deal up! Jesus, what the fuck did I do now? Why don't you tell us what you did? Mark, you're not gonna believe this. Cops picked me up in front of the club, right? Yeah. They take me down to the station, they sit me there, I'm there all night, you know, they hit me and shit. They hit you, huh? They're asking me questions and everything, but they let me go because I wouldn't say anything. Didn't say anything? They just let me walk, just because I wouldn't say anything. Of course, that's why I'm here. Didn't say a word? Swear to God. I'll tell you something, you son of a fucking bitch! I swear to... Fucking hell, you son of a bitch! I'm gonna break your goddamn face! I'll fucking knock your head off! You son of a bitch! I'll fucking kick your fucking ass! It's my deal! It's my deal! There's a better way. I can handle this. I can handle it. Calavera? I got a little something for your wolves. There's your fucking justice. Bring him in. Hey, dudes, you're my best friends. That was... Shut up. Mark. Come on, man, I didn't say anything. Mark, come on, I'm going now. This isn't gonna work. I mean, someone's gonna miss that body. Don't worry. Doc's got a friend down at the morgue, all right? Here, come on. Take this. Give us a call when you get to Miami, all right? Yeah. Look, uh, thanks a lot for, uh, the money. Everything. Hey, you're gonna be okay. I'm gonna miss you guys. Get high? Got some weed, some rock? Listen, I got a long way to go to try and fix this. I'm not asking you to forgive me. I think I probably used up my quota. I wish I could blame it on the drugs. I can't. Not completely. I got no excuses. I love you. And if someplace in you, you see something about me that you might think I'd make a good father, a good husband, I'd give anything in the world for another shot. Hey, look what I found, huh? Okay, I'm sorry. This is a big fucking mistake, man. I didn't say anything. I'm sorry. No guns. All I wanted was justice. Whatever you fucking want. What do you want? I know where the fucking guys are. Fucking bastards, man. I'm sorry. I didn't say a fucking word. I'll catch those fuckers. I know, I know. ♪ I'll give you money, baby ♪ You get him yet? No, he's not there. Come on, I need this guy. I know. I tried both numbers. Yeah, 962... 8803. I'll try it again. I don't like this. One pick-up point, that's just not right. Hi, baby. Hi. Wow, this is terrific. What's for dinner? Oh, a little chicken. Mm-hm. A little red wine. Little salad. Little candlelight. Okay, I'll tell you what. Save those candles, all right. We'll be back in a couple hours. Where's Attila? He's with Doc, why? Where are you going? We're going out. You're going on a run. Listen, Rebecca, don't kid yourself. This isn't all gonna happen overnight. Bullshit. That's just an excuse. Yeah, yeah, you hurt your leg so you can't surf. The money's too good and you can't stop your drug dealing, and your friends need you, and you can't even get a damn job. Rebecca, I'm doing this for you, too. You wanna go to Portland, that takes money. That has nothing to do with me. All right. Well, listen, this'll all be over in a couple hours. Well'll talk about it then. I love you. What are you doing here, man? Going out. No, man, nobody wants you to go. Everybody wants me to go. Oh. Hey, boys. Baby needs new shoes, woo! Remar, only take one tonight, okay. We'll take care of it. We don't need more than one, anyway. Thank you. So, dude, what's happening? Remar? Remar! Excuse me, I gotta talk to my mom. Yeah. Come on, you guys, you heard him. Let's get to work. Remar, I'm not letting you go out there, man. Listen, all right, I know what you're trying to do, okay, and I appreciate it. Hey, man, I love you. All right? It's just, I'm going out there, okay. It's a done deal. What do you have to prove out there? I got nothing to prove. Come on, let's go do this. One last time, all right? It's gonna be fun. I guarantee you. Come on, let's go. Oh, man. $100,000. Get it out. Don't go blind, man. Stay with us. Holy shit, fuck! Go! Come on! I'll kill you! Come on, man. Get up. I'm okay, man. You were right to go after I, it's okay, man. You got it? Remar! Remar! Come on, let's go! He's getting away! Let's move it! There's one door here, by this side. And there's these stairs that go up the back. These are just windows here that are, like, boarded up right here. Calavera's office is here on the second floor. Right there. Boys and girls, this is the Russian-made AK-47 assault rifle. Shoots single rounds or full rock and roll. Thing of beauty. No bullshit, all right? All right, listen, the important thing when we get in there, if you get hit, take it. You got it? I'll find you. Come on. Come on. Taking a siesta, amigo? Siesta's over, you fucking puto. No. Not the wolves. Shoot me? Go ahead, shoot me. Go ahead, shoot me. Hey, we're partners, huh? Partners, partners. Kill me! Look out! Where you going? Oh, south. Mexico. You know, build that houseboat. She's at the station. Alone. Now boarding for Portland. My, um, my train's leaving. I have to go. I know. I just wanted... It's, uh... It's all over. This... this is for you. If this is money, I don't want it. You need it. It's for the kid. You know, I was thinking. I don't know. If you wanted some help getting to Portland, you know, just so that you get there safe, you know, until you're settled, just for a little while. 1, um... I didn't wanna stick around, you know. I didn't wanna be there if he didn't come back. What are you doing? I don't want you missing your train. Well, aren't we gonna drive? To Portland? Yeah. Yeah, we can drive. Is this all you got? Yep. That's it. I got it. I can carry it. No, you gotta be careful. You know, you shouldn't even ride on the bike. It's dangerous. I'll be careful. Let's go. All right, but I'm gonna drive really slow.
