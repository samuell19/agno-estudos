Trading bats for bullets, Yankee star Joe DiMaggio promises to give Nazis a jolt. Ace fireballer Bob Feller has traded Cleveland gray for Navy blue. Baseball's biggest stars say "Look out, Mr. Hitler, the Yanks are coming." Not to mention the Indians, Red Sox, and Tigers and they won't come back till it's over there. Meanwhile, Chicago club owner Walter Harvey the candy bar king, met with other team owners at the famous Harvey Mansion as rumors persist that baseball may be shut down for the duration of the war. Harvey's promotional whiz kid, Ira Lowenstein has been given the job of figuring out how to keep baseball going. Good luck, Mr. Lowenstein. LET'S GO. HIT 'EM UP, P.C. STRIKE TWO. HEY!

Game's tied, 2-2 the bottom of the ninth inning with two runners in scoring position and only one out. FROM THE BELT, HERE'S THE DELIVERY. Oh, baby! She hit the cream cheese out of that one. Jimmy Dugan that master strategist had her swinging away. Boy, he sure knows his baseball. Mae: COME ON, DORIS! YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE ME PROUD.

UNTIL YOU DID THAT, I COULDN'T TELL IF YOU WERE DRUNK OR DEAD. IT WAS MADE VERY CLEAR TO ME WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO HERE. I SMILE... WAVE MY LITTLE HAT, AND I DID THAT. SO WHEN DO I GET PAID? YOU HAVE SOME PRETTY GOOD BALLPLAYERS. IF YOU'D ONLY GIVE THEM A LITTLE BIT... BALLPLAYERS?! I HAVEN'T GOT BALLPLAYERS. I'VE GOT GIRLS! GIRLS ARE WHAT YOU SLEEP WITH AFTER THE GAME NOT WHAT YOU COACH DURING THE GAME. IF WE PAID YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE, JIMMY COULD YOU BE JUST A LITTLE MORE DISGUSTING? I COULD CERTAINLY USE THE MONEY.

NOW I'M HITTING LIKE A GIRL. BUT BE NICE TO THEM. GOOD BALLPLAYERS. CATCH THAT, BLONDIE! Now batting for the Rockford Peaches #5, center fielder, Mae Mordabito. Here's the pitch... It's a shot into right center! It's up the alley. She's turning around first. She's digging up for third. THIRD! She's headed into third. DIRT IN THE SKIRT, MAE, DIRT IN THE SKIRT! She's in there with a triple. TIME. NO! She smacked that on the kisser. No wonder they call her "All the Way Mae." A TRIPLE. The next batter #32, SECOND BASEMAN MARLA HOOCH. Doris: EVELYN, LOOK AT THIS. I'VE GOT STILWELL'S SNACK ON MY CLEAT. Man: EASY OUT, EASY OUT. Woman: KEEP YOUR EYE ON IT, MARLA. HEY, WHAT ARE YOU, STUPID? Doris: SOMEBODY'S GOT TO RUN THE TEAM, JIMMY. SOMEBODY THAT ACTUALLY WATCHES THE GAMES. YOU'RE GOING TO SQUEEZE-BUNT WITH OUR BEST HITTER? HEY, BLONDE GIRL, WHAT'S THE SIGN TO SWING AWAY?

ALWAYS MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS WRONG, YOU KNOW? LIKE I WAS SOME SORT OF A WEIRD GIRL OR A STRANGE GIRL, OR NOT EVEN A GIRL JUST 'CAUSE I COULD PLAY. I BELIEVED THEM, TOO, BUT NOT ANYMORE, YOU KNOW. I MEAN, LOOK IT, THERE'S A LOT OF US. I THINK WE'RE ALL ALL RIGHT. WE ARE. GIVE ME THAT. Doris: SO LONG, CHARLIE. So, with two runs in the sixth South Bend gets even. Stilwell: I'VE GOT TO GO, I'VE GOT TO GO. SHAKE IT OFF. SAY, EVELYN, CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION? UH-HUH. WHICH TEAM DO YOU PLAY FOR? WELL, I... I'M A PEACH. I WAS JUST WONDERING BECAUSE I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHY YOU'D THROW HOME WHEN WE'VE GOT A TWO-RUN LEAD! YOU LET THE TYING RUN GET ON SECOND. WE LOST THE LEAGUE BECAUSE OF YOU! NOW YOU START USING YOUR HEAD. THAT'S LUMP THAT'S THREE FEET ABOVE YOUR ASS! ARE YOU CRYING? NO. ARE YOU CRYING? ARE YOU CRYING?! THERE'S NO CRYING. THERE'S NO CRYING IN BASEBALL. LEAVE HER ALONE. ZIP IT, DORIS. ROGER HORNSBY WAS MY MANAGER AND HE CALLED ME A TALKING PILE OF PIG SHIT AND THAT WAS WHEN MY PARENTS DROVE FROM MICHIGAN TO SEE ME PLAY! DID I CRY? NO, NO. NO! AND YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THERE'S NO CRYING IN BASEBALL. THERE'S NO CRYING IN BASEBALL! NO CRYING. WHAT'S THE MATTER, JIMMY? SHE'S CRYING, SIR. I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO THAT. PERHAPS YOU CHASTISED HER TOO VEHEMENTLY. GOOD RULE OF THUMB: TREAT EACH OF THESE GIRLS AS YOU WOULD TREAT YOUR MOTHER. DID ANYONE EVER TELL YOU YOU LOOK LIKE A PENIS WITH THAT LITTLE HAT ON? YOU'RE OUT OF HERE! NO, YOU MISUNDERSTOOD ME. NO, I DIDN'T! YOU CAN'T THROW ME OUT FOR THAT! OFF THIS FIELD! GET OFF THIS FIELD! Jimmy: I CAN'T BELIEVE NO ONE EVER CALLED YOU THAT BEFORE. THAT'S WHERE YOU BELONG. I'M IN CHARGE NOW... So, the crowd's a little light today what with the tractor show in town. If you're in the area, and you must be because this isn't a very powerful radio station COME ON DOWN TO THE BALL PARK AND BRING THE KIDDIES. PEOPLE BETTER START SHOWING UP. IF WE DON'T HAVE FANS, WE DON'T HAVE A LEAGUE. LADIES, HOW ARE YOU? YOU ALL LOOK WONDERFUL. Alice: MR. LOWENSTEIN. LADIES, THERE'S A REPORTER AND A PHOTOGRAPHER IN THE STANDS FROM LIFE MAGAZINE. Betty: LIFE MAGAZINE? DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME, DORIS. DOTTIE? I'M TRYING TO GET THEM TO DO A STORY ABOUT YOU. ME? WHY ME? YOU'RE THE QUEEN OF DIAMONDS. THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING YOU. WELL, DID YOU TELL THEM ANYTHING ABOUT ME? SURE. I TOLD HIM HOW THE SCOUT DIDN'T EVEN WANT YOU BUT HOW DOTTIE WOULDN'T COME WITHOUT HER KID SISTER. THEY REALLY LOVED IT. A REAL HUMAN INTEREST STORY. SO, WILL YOU JUST TRY AND GIVE THEM SOMETHING SPECTACULAR OUT THERE? I DON'T KNOW, UH... ANYTHING. WHY? WHAT'S THE MATTER? WELL, MAE, WE'RE NOT DOING SO WELL. HARVEY AND THE OTHER OWNERS THINK THEY MADE A MISTAKE. THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT CLOSING YOU DOWN. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? CLOSING WHAT DOWN? EXPLAIN YOURSELF. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THEY'RE BUSINESSMEN. NO PROFIT, NO PRODUCT. AND WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO, HUH? GO BACK TO TAXI DANCING? TEN CENTS SO SOME SLOB CAN SWEAT GIN ALL OVER ME? I'M NEVER DOING THAT AGAIN. YOU GO BACK AND TELL OLD RICH MR. CHOCOLATE MAN THAT HE AIN'T CLOSING ME DOWN! THEY CAN'T KEEP US FROM PLAYING. THEY CAN'T STOP US. I'M SORRY. I'M VERY SORRY. I AM TRYING MY BEST. SO WILL YOU..? JUST GIVE THEM EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT. Doris: WE ALWAYS DO. So, a slick play by Alice Gaspers and there's two gone HERE IN THE THIRD. That will bring up Dee Lynch. Lynch is the most consistent Belles hitter this year. OKAY, BURN IT IN. Settles in. Pops it up! Foul! Hinson should have no trouble with this. She's under it. YOU'RE OUT! Uncle Elmore's socks! What did she do?! Whoo-hoo! I CAN'T DO THAT. WHO CAN? WHAT IS HER NAME? DOTTIE HINSON, D-O-T-T-I-E. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? I JUST THOUGHT IT MIGHT HELP THE LEAGUE. SHIT! A GODDAMN CIRCUS.

THEY'RE JUMPING, THEY'RE HOPPING THEY'RE CHEERING, AND THEY PAID TO GET IN. YOU DID A FABULOUS JOB, IRA. THANK YOU, MR. HARVEY. I APPRECIATE IT, COMING FROM YOU BUT TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST THE GIRLS DESERVE MOST OF THE CREDIT. OH, THEY'RE GREAT. FORTUNATELY, WE WON'T NEED THEM ANYMORE. DO YOU WANT A PEANUT? NO. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHAT DO I MEAN? WE'RE WINNING THE WAR. I MEAN, ROOSEVELT HIMSELF SAID "MEN'S BASEBALL WON'T BE SHUT DOWN." WE WON'T NEED THE GIRLS NEXT YEAR. Bases loaded, bottom of the ninth Rockford up 6-2, two men out. No balls, two strikes... STRIKE THREE! And that is the ball game. Rockford is in the playoffs. I LOVE THESE GIRLS. I DON'T NEED THEM, BUT I LOVE THEM. COME ON. LET'S GO. AW, LOOK AT ME. I'M FULL OF PEANUTS. I'VE GOT PEANUTS ALL OVER MYSELF. GODDAMNED PEANUTS... THIS IS WHAT IT WILL BE LIKE IN THE FACTORIES TOO?

SEND THE BOYS RETURNING FROM WAR BACK TO THE KITCHEN? COME ON. EXCUSE ME. DO YOU KNOW HOW DEDICATED THESE GIRLS ARE? THEY PLAY WITH SPRAINED ANKLES, BROKEN FINGERS.

I SOLD YOUR PRODUCT WHEN THERE WAS NO PRODUCT. THIS IS A PRODUCT. THERE IS NO ROOM FOR GIRLS' BASEBALL IN THIS COUNTRY, ONCE THE WAR IS OVER. THEY'RE THROUGH. I THINK YOU'RE WRONG AND I'M GOING TO PROVE IT TO YOU, MR. HARVEY. HI. MY NAME IS MAE AND THAT'S MORE THAN A NAME; THAT'S AN ATTITUDE. THIS IS MY FRIEND, DORIS... BEST PLAYER ON THE TEAM.

I SEEM TO REMEMBER SOMEBODY TELLING ME TO GET MY FAT ASS BACK BEHIND THE PLATE. WAS THAT YOU OR THE UMPIRE? ALL I KNOW IS YOU COULD HAVE BACKED ME UP TODAY INSTEAD OF HOLDING ME BACK. I HOLD YOU BACK? IT'S LIKE AT HOME. IT'S LIKE IF YOU'RE HERE, THEN I'M NOT HERE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I MEAN. I KNOW I'M WRONG. I KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT AND I'M WRONG.

The Peaches are down to their final out but with tying and go-ahead runs in scoring position AND BIG DOTTIE HINSON STRIDING TO THE PLATE. Racine catcher: OKAY! LET'S GET OUT OF THIS INNING. COME ON. LET'S GO. Racine catcher: BLOW SMOKE, KIT. BLOW SMOKE. Here's the pitch. Oh. Bite me on the butt and call me an apple. She nearly took her head off. LAY IT IN! Mordabito scores. COME ON! COME ON! Murphy... she will score. HEY, THROW IT. Rockford has taken the lead 2-1. THAT'S MY WIFE. Racine catcher: OKAY, KIT. IT'S OKAY. IT'S NOT GOING TO HURT. ONE MORE. KEEP IT GOING. PUT IT PAST THE LITTLE QUEEN. PUT IT PAST HER. RIGHT PAST HER. Swings! There's a fly ball to left field. Goldie on her horse. She'll have to go for this one. The final out to retire the side but the damage has been done. Rockford leads our Belles 2-1 as we go to the bottom of the ninth. COME ON, IT'S OKAY. YOU GOT TO BAT NOW. RELAX. KIT, ONE RUN AND WE ARE BACK IN THIS BALL GAME. SHAKE IT OFF. YOU GOT TO HIT. Coach: OKAY, COME ON NOW. MAKE THEM PITCH TO YOU. ALL RIGHT, COME ON. STRIKE HER OUT! COME ON, GET AT THEM. COME ON! She swings at the first pitch. She belts it to deep center. Mordabito goes to the wall... and catches it. BEAUTIFUL CATCH. BEAUTIFUL, EH? Gotlander's pitch, and it is... in the dirt. Ball one. Doris: ELLEN SUE. ELLEN SUE. THAT LOOKED GOOD TO ME. THAT LOOKED GOOD TO ME. SHAKE THAT OFF, NOW. SHAKE THAT OFF. THAT AIN'T NOTHING. THAT AIN'T NOTHING. Gotlander... she delivers. Hindberg swings! And it's a ground ball between first and second. Hindberg, aboard at first with a base hit. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. ONE DOWN. WE GOT ONE DOWN. LET'S GO. Foul ball! Hinson on her horse. She's taking after it. THAT'S IT! THAT'S IT! THAT'S IT! SHE GOT IT! SHE GOT IT! Well, there's no question who the star of this game has been. DOTTIE HINSON HAS HER TEAM ONE OUT FROM THE TITLE. THERE YOU GO, DOT, THERE YOU GO. Coach: COME ON, KIT. NOW YOU'RE UP. YOU'RE THE HITTER NOW. LET'S GO. YOU CAN DO IT! YOU CAN DO IT! BRING HER HOME. HEY, KIT! COME ON. GET A HIT! COME ON. The last batter in Rockford's way is Kit Keller. Kit is one for three today. COME ON, KIT! HEY, KIT! CAN I HAVE TIMEOUT? TIME! HIGH FAST BALLS... SHE CAN'T HIT THEM, CAN'T LAY OFF OF THEM. ALL RIGHT. IF WE JUST HOLD THEM NOW, WE GOT IT. COME ON! COME ON, ELLEN SUE. ONE, TWO, THREE! ONE, TWO, THREE! PLAY BALL! STRIKE! Swing and a miss. Strike one. OH, YES. YES! THANK YOU. LAY OFF THE HIGH ONES. Here's the pitch. Swing and a miss. Strike two. ELLEN SUE! ONE MORE! ONE MORE! Here's the pitch. Keller swings, and it's a long fly ball. Back, back, back... It falls in there. No one will get to this ball. This should tie it up. Hendricks is rounding third. She will score. Keller is heading for third. Gardner hits the relay man with a frozen rope. The coach is giving Keller the stop sign... but no, she is not stopping! HOLD UP! HOLD UP! Keller is running through the stop sign at third. She ran through the sign. Here comes the throw. It should be in time, and... SAFE! Safe! She is safe! I can't believe it! Hinson dropped the ball! HINSON DROPPED THE BALL! The ball game is over. Racine has won the game, 3-2 and the World Series. Take me home, mama, and put me to bed! I have seen enough to know I have seen too much. KIT! KIT! KIT! KIT! KIT! KIT! KIT! KIT! KIT! KIT! KIT! KIT! KIT! KIT! KIT! KIT! COME ON.
