My wife... committed suicide on our wedding day. Tom, come here. What is it? "The Millennium Project seeks married couples "to participate in a thirty day research study. Payment, fifty thousand dollars." Wow. You can finish your book. We'd have enough money to start our lives together. If only I can find work. Fifty thousand dollars worth? Babe, we don't know what this is. You're right. So how do you feel about porn? We're not married. We lie. Hold on, hold on. I almost forgot. It's not exactly your fairy tale wedding. But I love you. Tom. Ya' hate it, I know I should've... I love it. 9/23. What day is that? It's the day you stole my heart. What? The Honeymoon Phase. That fleeting feeling of ecstasy that young couples experience. Why do the feelings fade? What's the difference between newly weds and a couple celebrating their fiftieth anniversary? Sex. Precisely. So, how long have you two been married? About a month. Well, I hate to sound crass but statistically your marriage is likely to fail. Excuse me? Sorry. The science is against us. It takes a very special kind of relationship to outlast biology. Are you married? Did biology get the best of you? My wife passed away a long time ago. - I'm sorry, I... - She's actually the reason I began this study. Why should the Honeymoon Phase end? Why can't it last forever. It should. Well... today we're here to determine if you're viable candidates for our program here. Think your marriage is up to the test? Absolutely. Please state your name. Thomas Henry Jacobs. - State your name please. - Evelyn Jacobs. So Mrs. Jacobs, what's your favorite thing about Tom? He's just... ...he's so sweet. He's really observant, too. That's what makes him a great writer. And your favorite thing about Eve? That's easy. Everything. Your worst memory together? We don't have one. - Hmm. - Is that a problem? Favorite memory together? What? Just one? How about your sex life? What? Is your husband dominant or submissive? Um... I'm dominant. I'm pretty... pretty dominant. Has Tom changed since you met him? Of course. Everyone changes. But we'll always love each other. It's a vow, right? I can't concentrate with you doing that. Hey, we don't have to do this, if you don't want to. No, we're doing this together. But hypothetically speaking, you know, if things become disadvantageous to us we should um... have a code word to stop it. Like a safe word? Yes, like a safe word. 9/23. 9/23. Did you seriously forget to pack my Tempur-Pedic pillow? You know I can't sleep without it. Julie, do we really have to do this right here? Yes, we have to do this here. You know, a good husband would go home and get it. - Glad we're not them. - Right. Welcome everyone and thank you for being part of history. Each and every one of you were chosen, not because you relationship was perfect, but because it's unique. Now as you may know... I once was married too and my wife Samantha would be very proud of the work we're about to begin here. Now, each couple here will be separated for final briefing. I know the process can be a little intimidating. I promise you'll all be reunited very soon. So, uh, A spouses will follow with the doctor on my left. B spouses with the doctor on my right. I hope you all enjoy your stay here. Tom, it's good. You sure? Because I think that it could... I have notes. But it's good. It's really good. A spouses, follow me. I'll see you soon. Now, I am going to countdown from ten. By the time I reach one... ...you'll be with Mr. Jacobs, in your new home. There. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two... one. Tom. Tom. Before I had arrived, I had no idea what to expect. By the end of all of this, would she love me, would I love her? At the moment I laid eyes on her I knew. I had to spend the rest of my life with here. Hey. Hey. Tom. Welcome, I'm your Hander, It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. Please, come in. Whoa, what is this? We call it The Mediator. It allows me to be with you without skewing the results of the study. That's incredible. Take a seat. I'll walk you through the protocol. Now, put on your headsets. Welcome to your orientation. These headsets will record your brain waves as we discuss your experiences over the next month, hopefully uncovering the truth behind The Honeymoon Phase. We'll start with something simple. Question one, who are you? I'm Eve Jacobs. Sorry. I'm Eve's husband, Thomas Henry Jacobs. That concludes Question One. If you need anything, I can be reached through The Mediator at any time. We'll speak again tomorrow. Oh... No way. What do you want to listen to? Whatever you'd like. Ooo Ooo Oooo What. "I've got your picture on my wall. "I think... dream about you when I sleep." Come on. "I think..." Whoa. Oh, your favorite. Hmm... What are these? Cookies. Really? Cookies. LSD cookies. My contribution to your book. Tom! What? Mine. Popcorn. Vodka. Chocolate cake. It's not instant. Oh my God. It's perfect. No. You're perfect. I love you... Get a condom. You are so beautiful. Then what are you waiting for? Whoa. That was incredible. What's wrong? I'm still processing it all. Was it too much? It just wasn't like you. - I'm sorry I... - No. I thought you would like it rough. No, it's okay. It's no one's fault. Hey. I love you. I love you, too. We're gonna get through this, babe. I love you. Push! Come on! Push! Come on! Here it comes. It's coming... Aw fuck! Fuck this! So cute. Wow. We should make one. Wait, you're serious? Why not? We're not exactly parent material. We can still have sex. With a condom. The first week was like our honeymoon... until one night everything changed. Are you sure they're safe? I... I know. Stop being a wimp. You've done it before. Oh wait, I forgot the drinks. Oh my brave man. It's not that bad. Blah. I don't feel anything. One, two... - Three, four, - Let go! - five, six, seven. - Close your eyes. Eight. Twenty-three... I can hear you. You're walking down the hall... ...Two and three quarters. Nine and three quarters. 31, 32, 33, 34... 60. Ready or not, here I come. I heard that. I know where you are now. Come out. Come out, wherever you are. Hmm. I give up. Come out. Boo! Asshole! Come on, you love jump scares. Just go hide. 1, 2, 3, 4. Alright, alright. Don't look. 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Tom? Help me! Somebody help! Help! Hey! Open! Open the door, he's trying to kill me! Let me in, please! - Who's trying to kill you? - Just let me in! It's locked, I'll tell Tom. Hold on! No, no! Tom, I need your help! Tom! Let me in please! Hey! Unlock the door! Let me in! Please! Tom! Hey. Hey, what's wrong? He killed her. Who? Hey, there's nobody there. He, he killed her. Babe, wait. Mrs. Jacobs, I need you to calm down. Don't tell me to calm down okay, because he killed her! It's not possible. Just check the cameras. Please. Somebody help! Open the door! Can you open the door! What's wrong! I checked without Handlers, every couple in the study is accounted for. But I saw them. I know I saw them. Babe, hey, hey. Maybe you just thought you did, okay? - No. - Yeah... She took some LSD earlier. Well, that explains the hallucinations. Illegal substances were strictly prohibited. I know. I know. We're sorry. Mrs. Jacobs... You're just gonna have to let the drugs take their course. Tom. Tom! Sorry, um... I don't know why I can't remember the notes. Then stop. Please. Hey, hey, hey. What's wrong? I'm just hungover. Want to lie down? No, I really need to get some work done. - I was thinking... - About you book? You know, last night when I was tripping, I kept imagining what our kids would look like? It just made me really want to start a family. Can we talk about this later? My head is killing me. Yeah. I just, I think it would be really good for us. You never felt that way before. Well I do now. We don't have the money. We're making fifty grand from this. - And what happens when we spend that? - Well I... Who knows when my visa's gonna go through, and then there's the green card. - And your fucking book. - Hey, I'm gonna finish it. Really Tom, because half the trip's gone and you haven't touched it! I've had writer's block. Well unblock it. I'm sorry. Me too. I'd help write it if I could. I know. Finish your book, and then we'll talk. Really? Yeah. Just try and write. Okay. I'll, uh... I'll be in my office. Come in. I have a surprise for you. You hate it. No, not at all. I love it. Then spill. You normally can't go a day without writing. What's up? Is this really the life we want? What do you mean? Me writing? Not being able to support a family? I know what I signed up for. You write the books. I'll design the covers. Remember? Hey, where'd our excitement go for that? Where's the Tom who dreamed of book signings and movie deals? Who believed anything was possible? That's the guy I fell in love with. Sure, it's gonna be a rough road ahead but we're a team no matter how broke we are. I'll meet you in bed. Don't trust Tom. Hello? Hello? Shit, sorry. You coming? Yeah, just gonna pee. Time to unwind. You gonna join me? I'm tired. Tomorrow? Alright. You look like you need a little relaxing, Mrs. Jacobs. I love that trip. Tom, I photoshopped you in. Yeah, I know. but that's when you realized you couldn't live without me. Is everything okay? You've been distant the past few days. Just because we haven't had sex, doesn't mean I'm not okay. I know, it's just you know you can talk to me, right? Mm-hmm. Why did you tell me not to trust Tom? He is not the man you think he is. What do you mean? You really can't tell? From your file I didn't think you'd make it past the first week. What are you saying? Tom's... Hey, what are you doing in here? I can't sleep. Again? And uh, what's that you're holding? I was hoping it could put me to sleep. That's very funny. You didn't read any, did you? It's still pretty rough. Just the dedication, it's really sweet. Well, you are my everything. Tom, what's going on? What do you mean? I know this sounds crazy but, are you messing with me? What? It's just, the Handler told me not to trust you. I'm gonna go talk to her. No, wait please. That night that I hallucinated you took the drugs too, right? Are you being serious? It's just, you've always been the anxious one and you're fine. You had a bad trip, it happens. But how do you know it wasn't real? I was with you, no one was there. You were barely there. Eve, listen to yourself, alright? If you can't trust me, maybe our relationship isn't strong enough. No, no. I do trust you, it's just... ever since we got to this house, things have felt... off. Why would she lie to me? To get to you, to drive us apart. Now this whole thing, it's one big test. Hey. Have I ever lied to you before? No. No. Then why would I now? Whatever. No, you're right. I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you, I promise. My girl is back. Good afternoon, Mrs. Jacobs. Oh, that looks great. Is there anything I can assist you with? Nope. Jesus! Eve, you scared me. I have a surprise for you. Okay, I'm coming. Right now? It's incredible. How about you unwrap one of your presents early? Tom, wait. Stop. Stop! What's wrong now? That's not how you kiss me. I'm kissing you the same way I always have. No, it feels different. What about now? - Now? - Please. - Now? - Tom, stop. Ow, fuck! For days I tried to convince her that everything was fine... she wouldn't hear it. I'll be handling you and Mrs. Jacobs from here on out. Is everything okay? No. She's not stable. She doesn't trust me, she doesn't trust anything. She's not the only one having trouble adjusting. Well I think she needs help. We're prescribing her a light sedative to help ease her worry. I'll let you know how things go. Who are you talking to? The Handler, the mediator rang. I didn't hear it, what did she want? - I called Mr. Jacobs... - Was I talking to you? She wanted to talk to me. Your headset's not on. Okay. What have you been telling her about me? That I've got a bit mad recently? - Have you? - Fuck you. You're trying to drug me? What would give you that idea? Eve, come on. Let me explain. We're trying to help. You've been missing your daily check-ins. So you drug me?! I think you're losing touch with reality. No. She's fucking with us, okay. First she says you're a liar and now she's your best friend. Eve, you need to calm down. Don't tell me to calm down. She's manipulating us. - Eve, come here. - Get off me! - Come here. - Get the fuck off me! You're the one running away, not me! Tom! What's wrong? Oh my God. Hey, are you okay? I think I'm pregnant. Are you sure? I keep gaining weight and I'm in here pissing nonstop. I'm pregnant... That's... ...amazing. Tom. We're gonna be a family. Tom, I'm only two weeks late, look at me. I need a doctor, we need to leave. We can't. Something is wrong, okay. To be this far along, I must've done something. Hey, which is why we need to trust them. What? No, we need to talk about our options. Options? There are no options. Experiment or not, that's my child, that's our child. What kind of a mother are you? What? Seriously... We're given the opportunity of a lifetime. And you choose now to have a fucking mental breakdown? I'm not crazy. Now, it's almost Christmas Day. For the sake of our family, can you please hold your prepartum depression shit together for six more days? Okay Tom, whatever you say. God. Mrs. Jacobs... Eve! Merry Christmas. This looks awesome. You hate that film, I bought it as a joke. Thanks. Not making an effort tonight? Not for you. - What about Amber? - What about no. We have to talk about it at some point? Yeah really, well how is that book coming along? You know you're attracted to a monster. What are you doing? I'm bored What would you like to do? You don't wanna finish the movie? Not if you don't want to. Well what do you want to do then? It doesn't matter. It does matter, Tom. Have a opinion that doesn't involve my body for once. You're doing it again. Doing what? Willing a problem into existence. Probably. Come on, please? This isn't you. - Do I need to get you pills? - No. Then can we just enjoy each other's company? And stop hating me? Because I love you, Mrs. Jacobs. You don't have to say that. - Say what? - "Mrs. Jacobs." Don't confuse me even more, I'm delusional enough. I'm gonna make some more popcorn. - Good evening, Eve. - Shh. I've only got a minute until he gets back. We need your help. I'm sorry, I can only observe your marriage. No, we are not married, okay. I don't know what this experiment is but I'm six fucking months pregnant... Eve. He's playing you. Tom, honey? Just a sec. I can wait. What? I read your book. All of it? All of it. There's a rational explanation. Can't wait to hear it. I haven't felt inspired to write, you keep pressuring me. I'll inspire you then. Write. Eve. Write. - I can't. - Write! Is this how you treat your husband? Tom, could you come here? Yeah, I'll be right there. Shut the door. I have an apology to make. I haven't been a good partner. You've been through a lot this month. Care to join me? Should you be drinking that? One glass won't hurt. Call it. Um... To our family. To your family. Lets play a game, one of your favorites. - Okay. - Never have I ever. You're on. I'll go first. Never have I ever been an American citizen. Drink. - Never have I ever. - What? Had sex with a man. Never have I ever had sex with a woman. Mm-hmm, yeah. Shit. It's okay, we have more. I've got another. Shoot. Never have I ever... ...tried to get someone pregnant. It's okay, I know. I just wanted a family. Drink. Never have I ever been married. That's a dumb one. You drink. Drink. 9/23. What? 9/23. I don't get it. I'm going to go get more wine. Hey. How about we go to bed? What are you doing? I'm cold. I'll warm you up. We're married, kiss me. We're not married. I'm... your... husband. You're not my husband. Calm down. Babe, unlock the door. I'm sorry, I'm not gonna hurt you. Let me in, okay. This is not good for our baby. Just open the door. Let me in! Eve? Eve. I'm coming in! Eve! Eve! Go on, say it. You're not my husband. Look at me. I said, look at me. If you question that I am him again, they're gonna see it. And this whole experiment is over. So, when the lights come back on, you're gonna hug me and say I'm sorry like a good wife. And if you ever try to hurt my baby again, I'll fucking kill you. I'll fucking kill you. Shh... It's okay, it's okay. I'm sorry. I know, I know, baby. It's okay. I think it's in your best interest that I terminate your stay. - What?! - Wait why? You're both entirely unfit to continue. Tom will help me through it. Please, we need this. Fine. I'm going to prescribe a stronger sedative for the duration of your stay. Thank you. Where's our handler? She's been removed from the study. Why don't we try to proceed as normal then? Question 26. How has your spouse changed over the past month? He hasn't. Very productive day, if I do say so myself. I have a surprise for you. Put it on. You know, the past month has been hard on us. Let's make tonight the start of something new. Eat up. Can I have a knife please? You don't need one. Do you like them? They're your favorite. You can take your medicine after dinner. It's better on a full stomach. You love this song. May I have this dance. Where's Tom? I'm right here. You're not him. You need to stop asking questions and accept that we are a family. Let him go and I'll leave with you. In your condition? No. Our love would never survive out there. Not yet. I know, I've made a lot of mistakes. We stay and we finish the experiment. I want you to know that I love you and our baby so much and you'll learn to love me, too. Why don't you love me? Let's move out. Mapping at 90%. Beautiful creatures, aren't they? Monarch butterflies. The only known species with access to its genetic memory. The key to the perfect clone. You cloned Tom? Where is he? We still need him as a failsafe to fill in any gaps of his clone's memory. You see, prior to this experiment, we can barely map memory to the brain. By using multiple couples with clone spouses, each imprinted with a slightly different technique. We've been able to create the perfect imprinting map. I just want Tom. I'm sorry. That's not possible. Mapping at 99%. No don't... Stop! Why? One dying doesn't matter. They all matter to me. We'll see. Don't! Welcome to your orientation. Stop! Eve! She's not ready. Stop! Stop! Shut up! All of you drop your weapons. Now! Do it. Kick them over to me. Reconnect now. Bring... me... Tom. Now Eve... Bring me Tom! Fetch Mr. Jacobs. Okay Samantha, darling, it's okay. This'll be over soon. Jonathan? Yes, it's me. What's going on? I brought you back. This is your wife, you sick fuck. You wouldn't understand. Does she know? - Know what? - No, please don't. - That she's a copy. - No, no, don't listen to her. Oh, she doesn't... Samantha, you're a clone, a knock off of someone else. A fucking experiment. A what? You experimented on me? I had no choice. He's been through what? Dozens of versions of you. Why use her as our Handler? To find the perfect one. You're her. I love you. I don't. Hey. Hey. Let him go. Samantha honey, I've got you. You're gonna be fine. Come on. We're going to get you out of here. Shit. Eve! Get away from him! - Hey, hey, whoa. - Leave her alone! If how... How do you know I'm not the real Tom? We're both bleeding out! They're still fucking with us! They stabbed me when they saw what you did to him. You know it's me. Kiss me. What? Just kiss me. You don't know anymore? 9/23. Eve. 9/23 is our safe word. They were going to kill you if I didn't tell 'em. I'm the one who told him that? Stop lying to her! Please, you're my everything. Your favorite color was crimson. - You love horror films. - Eve! On my 24th birthday, you created a picture of us together in England because you missed me so much. You know it's me. And I proposed to you that evening. Remember? We framed the picture and it's in a cabinet beside the bed. Eve, he's playing you. I told him everything. I've been watching him torture you for a month. Cuddling you. Fucking you. Getting you pregnant. I'm so sorry. What are you doing? Eve. Wait. I can't lose you. Do it. Eve, do it! Don't! Why? Tom? It's me. We gotta get out of here. Tom. Fuck. Eve lost the baby. But we managed to escape alive. Finally, her visa went through and we were able to start again. Tom, place the ring on Eve's finger and make your vows to her. I Tom, take thee, Eve, to be my lawful wedded wife. To have and to hold, from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, for as long as we both shall live. I now pronounce you husband and wife. Tom, you may kiss the bride. She was mine. You are beautiful. Get a condom. Are you sure? I want to have sex with my husband. You okay? Yeah. We were supposed to be a family. I love you. Eve? No. No, no, no. No, no. No. Come on, babe. Come... on. Come on, baby. Come on. Please. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! I don't know why she did it, we had the perfect life. I was the perfect husband.
