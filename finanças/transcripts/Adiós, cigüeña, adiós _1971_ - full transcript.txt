Do you ever feel guilty, Westy boy? WESTY: Oh, bloody oath, no. A few beers with lunch helps the brain I always find. No, no, about working in the automotive industry. It says here we’re helping to irretrievably pollute the biosphere. Oh, not me, mate. I haven’t done a scrap of work for 18 months and neither have you. That’s true. That’s true. Eh, did you hear the boss got stuck into me about my hair? No? Yeah. “Cut it," he said. “Cut it!” I wouldn’t stand for that, mate. Don’t worry, mate. Not me, not the old Stork. If you’ve got something they want, then don’t let them push you around. Look, mate, we’re as scarce as hen’s bloody teeth. Oh, I know, mate. I know. Why do you think they’re at the university months before exam time? Because we’re as scarce as hen’s bloody teeth. As scarce as hen’s bloody teeth. We’ve got four years of specialist knowledge up there. We don’t often use it. But it’s there if they want it. And that is the point. That is the bloody point. They can’t afford to push us around. They’re buying our brains, boy. And it’s our bloody business if we grow a little bit of insulation. They can’t make us do anything. They can’t make me wear a coat and tie. Of course not. I don’t want to! We’ve got them over a barrel, Stork. They can’t make me wear a shirt. They better not try, boy. I don’t want to! Every man has the right to his own... ..individuality. I don’t see why a man has to wear long bloody daks in the middle of summer either. Bloody absurd. (BLUES ROCK MUSIC) God! Stork! We can’t let them push us around, Westy boy! They’ll take me as I am or they won’t take me at all.

Hey, do me up, will you? What’s the trouble? No trouble. We’ve just got a 6’7" deranged revolutionary called Stork coming to stay the night. Who’s Stork? (DOOR BANGS) That’s Stork?! Who’s got a bloody bottle opener? G’day, Stork. Don’t ‘G’day’ me, boy. Just get me a bloody bottle opener! Hey, great bird. This is Anna, Stork. Who’s the lucky man? Yeah? On with the both of them? lwouldn’t put it as bluntly as that. Call a spade a spade, moll! Whoo-ha! The old menage-la-troy, eh? What a bloody capper! Hey, what’s the smell? What smell? The smell, boy. I got me a great nose for a smell, and there’s a smell. I’m not staying here if that keeps up. I think I can smell something. There’s the beer. Get it in ya! Westy. Not before a meal, Stork. Don’t give me that. Got any luggage? Stork travels light, boy. Clothes he wears and half a D. Get stuck into it, Clyde. You too, Anna? No, thank you. Now don’t get snaky with me, moll. Anna doesn’t touch it. Bloody poser. Yes. Well, lthink I’ll leave you gentlemen to it. Knows her place. Walked out of GM H today. CLYDE: We know. l’ve dropped out. Get meself some gear, a few beads. Off to the Ganges as soon as I can raise the fare. Might even do Australia on a machine. (ROCK MUSIC) Right, that’s as far as you come, boy. What’s up, Albert? Get inside, Madge! I’ve just caught one of these sex-crazed young bikies. TONY: So you’ve left General Motors? Booted out! WESTY: Good place to be booted out of too. First to go come the revolution. Revolution? Bloody oath! Everything’s gotta go, boy. Tear down the old and let the new evolve. Oh, you’re a bull artist, Stork. When was the last time you manned the barricades? Are you trying to deny that this society is sick and rotten to the core, Clyde? Stork wouldn’t know an anarchist from an orifice. Look, I’ve got a file on me! Which of you has a file? He probably has got a file. The trouble with you buggers is you’re embedded in the system. Read Marcuse, boy. They’re getting at you. You’re being manipulated. Hey, how’s the moll situation around here? (Splutters) What? Thought you could fix me up with a hot moll from the flats round here. Sure. Maybe you’d like Anna. No, no, no, no, no! Thanks all the same. Hey, how do you two work it? On a roster system?! (Laughs) Then again, I must admit, she is a beautiful woman, loaded with bourgeois affectations, of course. But then again, a little bit of the old bourgeois affectation turns me on too. Do you think that’s strange? Oh, shut up, Stork. lmean...| mean, if I was a real gut socialist, I’d want to smash every socially affected bitch I met. But instead of that, ljust... | just want to... Your talk is mightier than your stalk, boy. Probably means We got a socioeconomic hang-up. STORK: Hey! How do they. . . how do they decide who gets what and where? TONY: Oh, shut up, Stork. (Clears throat) Anna has a delicate little emotional compass in her head, so she says. Sometimes it points to Tony and sometimes it points to me. Is that what she tells you? Word for word. What a load of crap! (Laughs wildly) Well, she is inclined to dramatise. Hey! Hey! Who’s the compass pointing to tonight, eh? lt’s bloody fascinating. Both of you in the same house! Bloody fascinating! Well, a bloody heartless lot you turned out to be. CLYDE: What? Anyone with any sensitivity would realise that a man who won’t eat breakfast is emitting a cry of psychological pain. We thought you had a hangover. Hey, drop us off here, Anna. Marcuse is onto this, boy. Right onto it. Under capitalism, man is encouraged to no longer feel responsible to his fellow man. You’ll be looking for a job today? l’ve dropped out, boy. l’ve dropped out. Off to the Ganges. Oh, I don’t know. I’ve heard a lot of things against the Ganges. lndians crap in it. Well, it is their river. Listen, if you decide to change your mind, shoot into the Sportsmen’s Club about 2:00. They might be able to fix you up with ajob, alright? Anywhere in particular? Drive, moll, drive. Leave our past behind us. Well, actually, I’m only going as far as the uni. (Sighs) That’II do. (ROCK MUSIC) Today, we are going to lay out Abraham Maslow on the table of the intellect and bring to bear our scalpels of the mind. Who will make the first incision? Come on. Come on. Psychology is the study of the mind. You’re not here for decoration. Although, I must admit, that some of you are... ..quite decorative. And some of you aren’t. Perhaps we will start with this young gentleman here. What, young man, do you know of Abraham Maslow? He’s Jewish. (Students laugh) Oh, very good. Very good. Something else, perhaps? He’s a Jewish psychologist. We have a giant intelligence here. Truly! If one puts one’s ear close to the skull, one can almost hear the roaring of neural activity. (Students laugh) What, young man, are your thoughts on Maslow’s motivational hierarchy? If one looks closely at Maslow’s middle level, what does one see? I reckon he gets a little bit hairy around that area. You are suggesting that his thoughts are a little kinky. It doesn’t wash with me, mate. | see. And if we look at Maslow’s lower levels... ..has he enough support? If he hasn’t, he can always wear a jockstrap. (Students laugh) | see we have a comedian in our midst. Are you aware, young man, we have a lady of the cloth present who may find your humour somewhat offensive? There’s nothing offensive about a jockstrap. It’s what’s in it you’ve got to worry about! (Students laugh) I would suggest, sir, you are a fool, a buffoon and a nuisance. | suggest you keep your mouth shut for the remainder of the lecture. | suggest, sir, you stop perving on the moll. What? Keep your eyes off Anna! I beg your pardon! I pay tax money for you to teach, not perv on the moll. Who is this man? I’ve never seen him before. I’m certain he doesn’t attend lectures. Marcuse is onto you too. I must ask you to leave. Can you design a four-speed synchromesh gearbox? What? (Scoffs) Yeah. ( DOOR SLAMS) (GENTLE WHISTLED MELODY) (Groans) Hey, here’s one that’d suit you, Stork. The Australian Council of Trade Unions is advertising for an assistant secretary. (JOLLY MILITARY MUSIC) Alright, Dick. Wagejustice. We’d like to, Graham, but the big boys are leaning on us. Do you know what, Dick? What? You’re nothing but a hireling of the oppressors. (Spits) Take away your title, take away your wig, take away your robes, and what have you got? Six months for indecent exposure. ANNA: Hey, how about this one, Stork? “Engineers required for Australian Trust Territory in Antarctica." Give it a rest. 100 degrees below and no molls? (WIND HOWLS) How’s the fuel? Enough for a week, if we’re lucky. Food will last four days... for the three of us. If there were two of us, it could last a week. Well, fellas, l... ..I think I’ll take a little walk in the snow. I may be gone a while. Stork, boy, I’ll write you into my memoirs. Two chapters. Farewell. . . mate. Easy, boy, easy. I’m just gonna strangle a darkie. You said you’d be gone a while. | get constipated in cold weather. Stork, you can’t go in looking like that. Why not? I’m gonna introduce you to my boss. He’s a top bloody consultant. Come on. You must be joking. How many of them are running around the city, eh? Watch it, fella. If I took a size 32 chest and stretched it on the rack for a week, hmm, maybe we could do something. Just do the best you can, will you? Uh, what’s the weather like up there? (lmpatiently) Watch it, fella! You ever get giddy from lack of oxygen? Bloody little newt. Got it in for me ’cause I’m tall, fair and Nordic. Now, no politics, and don’t tell him you went to Monash. Right. (MUZAK PLAYS IN BACKGROUND) G’day, Alan. A friend of mine, Graham Wallace. Top-notch mechanical engineer. Sit down, fellas. Eating, fellas? Uh, no, no, no. Justjumping up and down. Three beers, thanks, and, um...parmigiana. What’s that? Well, uh, it’s a veal done in wine sauce with...grilled cheese on top. Do you serve prawns? (Chuckles) Curried prawns. Oh, fair enough. You’re with GMH, Graham? Uh, at the moment. At the moment. Not happy with them? Well, it’s not so much that I’m unhappy with them, Alan. It’s just that one is always looking for something more challenging. Quite so. Quite so. Stork was, uh...uh, a story he told me was that there wasn’t much in the way of technical innovation in the automotive industry at the moment, Alan. True. Very, very true. Cheers. You haven’t any postgraduate training in management, Graham. No, I’m not really interested in management. Why not? I couldn’t manage my own bowels till lwas five. (Laughs) Um, Graham’s at a decision plateau right now, Alan. Planning, Graham — that’s the name of the game. We have to be making these moves for the future all the time. The human being is the finest information processor that’s ever been devised. Judgments, estimations, calculations, predictions, estimations and outputs, outputs, outputs. All the time, outputs. Yeah, well...| don’t know what you’ll say, Alan, but, I mean, well... well, often I ask myself, “What’s the point?!" What’s the point? Uh, well, look, how do you know you haven’t got cancer of the bowel? What? Well...often I think to myself that I’ll really put in an effort. Outputs, outputs, outputs, outputs — just like you say. Now, take this morning, for instance. Now, the first thing I said to myself when I got up was it was about time I got myself a bit of a...a woman. It’s a perennial problem of mine, and I started to work out a few strategies, when all of a sudden I ran my tongue around my bloody gum. And there’s this lump here, you see? It’s still there. And I said to myself, “What’s the use, you stupid bugger? “You’ve gone and got yourself cancer of the bloody gum.” (Laughs) Graham keeps joking about his symptoms. It gives us all a laugh. Hmm. Well, if that really represents your outlook on life, Graham, I’d start getting worried. I would if I didn’t have cancer of the gum. Good one. Good one. He keeps throwing these little jokes in. Marvellous effect on office morale, Alan. Yes. Three more beers, thanks. Just a word of advice, Graham. Not that l mind, of course, but, uh, a lot of top-level executives might not appreciate this sort of thing at the first meeting. Another thing... Something wrong, Graham? What’s the reputation of this joint like? What do you mean? They don’t reheat their old food, do they? I’m sure they don’t. I reckon I got a crook bloody prawn. My mother always said to watch the seafood. You can bloody near die if the bacterial activity gets too high. Oh, come on, Stork. Enough’s enough. I reckon I better go out to the dyke and chuck this lot up — stick my fingers down my throat. (Laughs politely) That routine kills them at GMH. Funny guy...Stork. (PEOPLE CHA'I'I'ER) That’s right, yes. I’m doing my doctorate. I’m writing my thesis at the moment. How very thrilling. Yes. Atomic physics. How exciting. And your mother? She’s fine, thanks. We’ve grown out of touch recently. I really must give her a ring soon. So nice to have seen you. Oh, ’bye. Jesus, you can stack on a BBC when you want to. Something very familiar about all this stuff. I had no idea you were so up with the avant-garde, Stork. (Clears throat) Oh, excuse me. Weird stuff, Stork. Something very familiar about all this, mate. Yeah, I got the same feeling. Assemblage, yes. Oh, listen to it! But he takes it further. Much further than, say, Stankowicz or Kibble. Take this...this piece here. Here, we see the...the artist’s, um, groping for the poetic reference of, um...disintegration and wastage. lt constitutes, in fact, a...we||, an open-ended comment on the, um...on the affluent society. Excuse me while I chunder. You ought to hear him crapping on at home, mate. Modern jazz, and the bugger’s tone-deaf. Art movies, and he only reads the reviews. Something’s gonna have to be done about him, mate. Hey! Frankie bloody Dork! What are you doing in a place like this? Oh, Stork! Westy! I’m the bloody artist. Nah! You’re joking! Beats boilermaking at General Motors. What, you left the General? Blood oath. Couldn’t express my inner tensions. Come here. That’s a Holden camshaft. Recognise it? Do |? I made a minor design change on that spindle there. Yeah, well, if you look here, | bolted a piston on. Normally, you’d go for a Holden piston, wouldn’t you? Your mind would be set in that direction. Holden camshaft, Holden piston. I suppose. Yeah. This is where your creative talent comes in. l whacked on a little Torana piston. Gives you a funny feeling, Stork. Bloody oath. Hey, do you earn a living out of this, Frank? How does 15 big ones grab you? (Whistles) Got a spare blovvtorch. (Whistles) Oh, that’s not the reason I do it. I want to leave something behind me on this planet, Stork. Jesus, Frankie! That’s bloody great! ANNA: So vibrant, Stork. And the colours are so rich. Is this a landscape or an abstract? I call them ‘chunderscapes’, kid. They’re, uh, nonfigurative. Could lw... No, I don’t suppose I could ask you. Come on, kid. Could I actually watch you working? Why not? I’m just about to start on a canvas. (GENTLE GUITAR MUSIC) (Sighs contentedly) (Whispers) Right. ( BOTI'LE TOP RA'I'I'LES ON TABLE) Ah! Oh! lt’s fascinating watching you, Stork. Yeah. There’s something...chilling about the act of creation. How do you know so exactly what’s...just right? Well, that’s a...hard question to ask an artist, kid. I mean, it... ..it just sort of...comes out. (Retches) Critics are calling this the most intoxicating new artform this century. Uniquely Australian. Yeah, but what craps me are the... ..are those people who reckon anyone can do it. Oh, you always get that sort of thing. You’ve got to eat the right food and you’ve got to drink the right beer and... (Groans) l...| think I can feel the...creative impulse. Here comes $10,000! (Vomits) Oh, here we go again. What? See that old bitch? Bought my best piece at my last three exhibitions. Jeez, lwouldn’t complain. Ah, it all sells anyhow, mate. Oh, I’d give my right arm to louse up that sale. Has anybody else asked about it? Yes, one of the public collections has expressed interest in it. Hmm. There’s no doubt about you, Mrs Grange-Simmons. This is certainly the pick of the show. You really think so? Oh, yes. And I say that notjust because of, well, its superb manipulation of its spatial elements, nor because of its sheer sensuality, but really because this represents the private parts of the artist’s consciousness which he dare not reveal to anyone. Oh, the bitch is gonna buy it. Eh? What? This calls for the old smoked oyster routine. What’s that? What’s that? Haven’t you seen it? Oh, it’s a bloody beauty. I’ll show you. Stand over there, Westy, and act the part of the old Toorak tart. (Plummy accent) Over here? Yeah. (Giggles affectedly) You right? Yes. OK, now, I’m coming towards you with the horses’ doovers, you see? And as I come towards you, l stuff a smoked oyster up my nostril like this. And I come towards you like this. (Affectedly) “Uh, excuse me, madam, but have you got a handkerchief?" Now, fumble around. Just fumble around. “Uh, never mind, Miss." (Both laugh) Bloody beauty, eh? Bloody beauty, Stork. It’s a bloody beauty. Get out there and kill them, Stork. Go on, give us a beer first. Can’t wait to see the look on Tony’s face. This... (Laughs) This” really strip a layer off his social veneer. Get out there, Stork, before the bitch buys it. Give us a beer first! Sure thing. Got to whip up a bit of the old courage, hey? Yeah. Sure thing. Hey, you reckon I ought to do it? Bloody oath. And quick. I don’t really want to make too much of a fool of old Tony. It’s a great gag, Stork. They’ll laugh themselves...sick. Yeah, the place needs livening up. Oh, it’s a bloody funny stunt. Oh, it goes over tremendously. (Both laugh) I killed them. I killed them. You should’ve seen the look on the old cow’s face. (Laughs) l was... (Angrily) Very funny. (Laughs) Very bloody funny! Big joke, West. I suppose you put him up to it. Well, you’ve made a bloody fool of yourself, Stork. He’s in a state, isn’t he? l was pretty bloody good. l rammed it in so hard, I had to shake my head to get it out! It was pretty good all the same. |’|| drink to that. Oh, Jesus. Hey, Frankie? Yeah? Are they a good catering mob? I think so. They, uh...they would be fresh oysters, wouldn’t they? (MELLOW GUITAR MUSIC) (GENTLE WHISTLED MELODY) Hey, Westy! Hey, Westy, you bloody little vacant halfvvit, get out here! The smell’s still here. Getting worse. TONY: He’s sleeping. 7:30, and the bastard’s sleeping! Sleeping! Always sleeping! The body of a youth and the metabolism of an octogenarian. Hey, Tony? What? Come and have a beer, mate. I’m working. Probably still shirty about the oyster. Thanks, Mother. Righto, Stork. It’s 17 minutes into the last quarter and the Magpies are trailing by 11 points. Two straight kicks the difference. Now, there’s a slight crosswind favouring neither goal but making it advantageous to kick via the scoring flank, which in this case is the Members Stand wing. (Groans contentedly) Umpire Jolley bounces the ball in the centre. And big ‘Jerker’s up, and with a mighty punch gets it back to Thommo, who picks it up like a bloody rover. McKenna’s sprinting towards the scoring pocket like a bloody hare! The bloody crowd go wild! (CROWD CHEERS) (CROWD CHEERS) (CROWD SHOUTS) Stork turns and, with a beautiful drop-punt, steers it through the centre. (CROWD CHEERS) And the Pies are only five points down approaching time-on period. Time for a quick drink before the bounce. (Groans contentedly) Just keeping fit. (Laughs awkwardly) Uh-huh. How are things at uni? Oh, the lectures are pretty dull these days. Uh...would you like to be Carlton? Hmm? Collingwood are kicking towards the Jollimont end and Carlton are kicking towards the footbridge. Alright. Um, well... ..we’ve just booted a goal but you’re still ahead by five points and there’s danger of a run-on. Well, what’s that? It means we’re psychologically aroused and we may play above ourselves. You’re gonna have to defend like hell. Well, I don’t know if I should if you’re psychologically aroused. Well, uh...we||, the ball is about to be bounced in the centre and you’ve got to contest the knock with me. Well, you’re taller than I am. Oh, look, jump, woman. Justjump. (Groans) (SIREN BLARES) What happens now? Well, if we weren’t being watched by 100,000 pairs of beady eyes, I could think of something. (Clears throat) What’s going on? Stork and l were playing football. You coming? Clyde and Tony are taking me to dinner. I’d better get ready. (GENTLE WHISTLED MELODY) (Chuckles) Must remember to thank the old girl for the socks. Bloody awful socks, Mum, but great footballs. Must get her to knit me a jumper next time. I could do with a bedspread. lt’s bloody cold in winter. (Gulps) (Coughs) (Gasps for breath) Bloody thing’s gonna stop! I don’t care what the doctor said! You’re going out. You can’t expect a poor little muscle to keep pounding away for years against clogged arteries. They shouldn’t tell you these things. I haven’t been game to tackle preserved peaches ever since I read about botulism. In two seconds, double vision. Five, and you’re dead! (GROOW RENDITION OF FUNERAL MARCH PLAYS) MAN: All flesh is grass. Ashes to ashes, dust unto dust. What can one say to comfort his loved ones except “We shall miss him”? Speak for yourself! It took my six weeks to knit him a pullover and then he goes and pegs out on me. It won’t fit anyone else. (Clears throat) We shall not see his like again. You wouldn’t be so sanctimonious if you knew about that smoked oyster routine. Or at Leon’s Bistro, where the stupid bastard... Or the tutorial... (All talk at once) CLYDE: Stupid bastard. He was an atheist, you know? I thought I heard someone out here. What are you doing, Stork? I’m going out. Dressed like that? Out of the world, you silly moll! I’m dying. Oh, yeah? What of? Heart, maybe. Heart. Doctor says acute indigestion but I reckon he’s withholding something. Really? Weakened by botulism, poor little bastard, fighting to get the old corpuscles through clogged arteries. Stork, you’re a hypochondriac. | sat down today and worked out a truly terrifying figure. I didn’t have anything else to do, so l-l worked it out. Alright, if your arteries clog to half their normal diameter, your...heart has to work 32 times as hard! That is a chilling figure. 32 times! Poor little bastard. lwouldn’t have thought it would be 32. Neither would I, but you have to believe it now, don’t you? Bugger science. Bugger technology. (Groans) Who are you with tonight? You must think it’s a bit odd the way I alternate between Clyde and Tony. Yeah, I do. It turns me on. It’s quite possible to have a simultaneous commitment to two people, you know? Yes, well, I’d be quite prepared to believe you could have a simultaneous commitment to three. I thought you were dying. Well, it says something for my courage, doesn’t it? Have you ever asked yourself why I’m doing it? No. Consider. Consider a man who’s resolute, determined, ambitious, commanding, witty, well on his way to being a considerable success in life. And consider also a man who’s well-read, stylish, well-connected, culturally aware. Who am | describing? Chairman Mao. (Laughs) Seriously. Oh, look, I don’t know. Well, put Clyde and Tony together and what have you got? Two consenting male adults. ANNA: Stork, it’s important to me that you don’t see me as just some shallow little hedonist. I’ve never thought of you in that way before. Good. Up until now. Stork... Look, on the surface I... I may seem cool and in control, but underneath there is a core of genuine feeling. I want you to believe that. Oh, I can... I can believe...believe that. No. I want you to believe, Stork! Really believe. I’m trying, moll. I’m trying. Stork, I want to confide in you, not get perved on. lt’sjust that I love the way you breathe. Stork, | wish you’d take me seriously...as a person. I’ll give it a try, moll. Sit down. I don’t know where to start. Start by moving back a bit. It’s the men, Stork. | feel an awful guilt at what I must be doing to them and the relationship between them. STORK: Ah. Well, it can’t be too pleasant for a man to be fighting for a sense of personal adequacy, can it? No. That’s what I’m forcing them to do, though — sampling and comparing their personal adequacies, the one with the other. Can you understand why I feel guilt? Oh, for sure, for sure. Can you understand why I’m doing it? l was wondering about that. Stork, I’m the sort of person who... ..believes in their feelings, and feelings must flow — they can’t be dammed. Be damned. (Anna sighs) I can’t be constrained by arbitrary social norms, Stork. One day I may make a commitment, but not yet. You’re waiting for the emotional compass to settle, are you? What? Oh, it’s a little analogy I use to describe decisions that aren’t really rational — decisions of commitment, that is. l liken it to the settling of an emotional compass in my mind. (Gasps) That’s amazing! Yes, it is a pretty clever little analogy, isn’t it? I call it the emotional compass analogy. Eventually the needle points... Stork? M m? You’re not gonna believe this. I know. I use the very same analogy. I don’t believe it! I mean, I’d be prepared to believe an emotional scales-in-the-balance type analogy. Now, that one, a lot of people use. But, by God, the compass! The compass is mine! You realise what this means, Stork? No. It means, in some mysterious way, our minds are attuned. Do you know what that’s called? No. Empathy. It means we have the capacity to develop a thoroughgoing cerebral relationship. Well, I don’t know whether it’s a very good idea to divorce the mind from the body, Anna. Now, | feel a total relationship just might be more therapeutic. Stork, what I need from you is empathy. But I feel I could give so much more. Stork, I already have two total relationships. A cerebral one is all I could fit in. Well...we||, couldn’t we start with a quick total relationship and drift back to something cerebral later? Don’t spoil it, Stork. This new relationship of ours is very important to me. I need empathy. Yeah. Well, any time. What good’s a bloody cerebral relationship to a man with clogged arteries? You bitch, Mother. Every morning of my young life, a bloody coddled egg for breakfast. And there was I, defenceless, and unable to shake off the maternal yoke. Oh! Pump, you bastard, pump!

Who’s that got me jealous of you? J‘ Who walks in when I walk out? Who’s stolen your heart, baby? J‘ Who’s that? Who’s that got me worrying too? J‘ Oh, when we kiss, I kinda miss something that used to be J‘ Because every day when I’m away J‘ Who walks in when I walk out? Don’t you know you’re my baby? J‘ Who’s that? Who’s that got me jealous of you... J‘ Hello, Helena. Hello. How are you? What can I do for you? (Mouths words silently) SONG: J‘ Bom, bom, bom J‘ Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom... J‘ You expecting someone? Get lost! Hey, Stork. Mm? How do you like me new clothes? Bloody awful. Oh, Anna said I looked rather masculine...in my own way. You look like a bloody little poofter. Oh, lwouldn’t say that. Go and have a look at yourself. Pissed to the eyeballs. Well, I’m of good pioneering stock. A face that only Wangaratta could spawn. Stork, have you ever felt the lure of the soil? What? The black earth, Stork, sucking in God’s rain, fondling the golden grain till an eruption bursts into life! Back off, you poofter! Back off! What we’ve lost in these bloody great polluted cities, Stork, is our...our link with the earth. Haven’t you ever felt sometimes that you’d like to get down on your knees and make love to 10 acres of outback? Jesus, West! Just you and the black earth, Stork. The primordial challenge! Land, land, bring forth of your abundance that l and my family might live! The point is, Stork, there’s cheap land in the west and a fortune to be made from soya beans. Soya beans? Bloody oath, mate. I’ll put up the capital. You can buy in out of the profits. No-one to boss you around — just you, your own sweat, and the black earth! How’s it sound, eh? (RUSTIC BANJO MUSIC) It’s my turn to pull, Stork. Oh, you haven’t the stamina, little fella. But we’ve ploughed 60 acres, Stork, and it’s still not breakfast. Hey! You cunning little rat! It could be a good lurk. Come outside and I’ll show you something. Come on. WESTY: Have you been down here, Stork? STORK: It’s the bloody Black Hole of Calcutta! I can give you earth, boy, and I can give you growth, living growth. Growth?! Growth. Oh, come on, West, here in the bloody cellar? Take a look. (Grunts) (Gasps) Oh, it’s the smell! It’s the bloody smell! That’s the smell of a crop of mushrooms, Stork... (Coughs) ..pushing their way up through...virg...virgin soil. (Coughs and gasps) (Both cough and gasp) This may be virgin soil, West, but these mushrooms are stuffed. I’ve got this little friend that I really think you ought to meet. Little? What do you mean little? Well, he’s about 6’4". Oh, that’s alright. Oh, good. What do you want me for? SONG: J‘ Time to kiss J‘ And in the glimmer of moonlight J‘ l’ll hear a little song something like this J‘ Like what, Ernie? J‘ Like this J‘ If you like a ukelele lady J‘ Ukelele lady like-a you J‘ If you like to linger where it’s shady J‘ Ukelele lady linger too J‘ If you kiss a ukelele lady J‘ And you promise ever to be true J‘ And she sees another ukelele J‘ Lady fooling round with you... J‘ (KNOCK AT DOOR) Get lost, West. You Graham Wallace? Yeah. I believe you’re interested in, uh, meeting me. l’m Helena Elk. l...was thinking about it in a sort of way. Right. l spilled beer over my daks. Yeah, I’ve heard that one before. You just keep your daks on, boy, till we get a few things straightened out. Now, I don’t intend to be used as a purely sexual object. That’s fair enough. And I’m not a lesbian. I’m a normal woman with normal desires... ..except I will not submit to the demeaning concept of womanhood which you bastards have forced upon us. Do you understand? Bastards! Do you think so? Do you know what? There’s a woman Shakespeare lying dead in some obscure English cemetery because of you. And a woman Beethoven and a woman Rembrandt and a woman Einstein. They were strangled at birth, Wallace — squeezed into slavery by men like yourself! Now...|-| don’t think that’s entirely... Well, what have you done about it, hey? I mean, I haven’t seen you out demonstrating or writing pamphlets or picketing the cosmetic industry. You’rejust another small ‘m’ man, aren’t you, Wallace? Would you like a beer? Now, there’s two ways we can go about this. Either we can treat each other as purely sexual objects and get stuck into it right away, or you could treat me as a sexual object and we’d have a hell of a row about it later. Which do you prefer? Uh, well, it’s a difficult question to answer, isn’t it? I mean, they’ve both got their disadvantages, haven’t they? I think I prefer the second. I like a gutsy man. Look, look, look, Helena, I’d better lay this on the line. Yeah. I’ve gotta go out and, uh... Eliminate? Yeah. That’s OK. I’ll wait here. (GENERAL CHA'I'I'ER) Shh! I am about to be castrated. What? Helena. Helena Elk. (Laughs) I think I’d rather stay a... ..stay a....than...than that. Are you a virgin, Stork? Look, moll. Do you think I’ve been rushed? (GENTLE GUITAR MUSIC) SONG: J‘ There’s a light J‘ There’s a light J‘ Across the valley J‘ There’s a light J‘ There’s a light J‘ Under the sea J‘ But a brighter, brighter light is shining J‘ Inside you, dear lnside me, ooh J‘ There’s a light J‘ There’s a light J‘ Under the ocean J‘ There’s a light J‘ There’s a light J‘ lnside that tree J‘ Oh, but a brighter, brighter light is shining J‘ Inside you, dear lnside me J‘ Once when l was walking through the valley J‘ The night was dark and a way could not be found J‘ Slipped and almost fell into the river, yes I did J‘ And I thank God that the moon came out J‘ OthenIvise I would’ve drowned J‘ And there’s a light J‘ There’s a light J‘ Across the valley J‘ There’s a light J‘ There’s a light J‘ Under that sea J‘ But a brighter, brighter light is shining J‘ Inside you, dear lnside me J‘ Alright, honey (LIVELY HARMONICA SOLO) J‘ Well, learn a little truth in every story J‘ Learn a little wisdom every day J‘ When the world hangs heavy on your shoulder, my little friend J‘ Just sink inside yourself and say J‘ Oh, there’s a light J‘ There’s a light J‘ Across the valley J‘ There’s a light J‘ There’s a light J‘ Under the sea J‘ But a brighter, brighter light is shining J‘ Inside you, dear lnside me J‘ Inside you, dear lnside me J‘ Inside you, dear J‘ lnside me. J‘ Hey. What? What are you doing? Well, I thought perhaps we’d better be going. Where? Well, I thought perhaps back to the party. What?! Anna, baby! They’ll miss us if we don’t get back soon. You can forget that scene, moll. Did we or did we not arrive at a great physiological truth beneath those sheets? Don’t let’s get overdramatic. Dramatic! Answer me this. Was I or...was | not... ..satisfactory? Of course you were. But it wouldn’t be right to... To what? To break it off with Clyde and Tony just like that. Haven’t you read Norman Mailer? No. Oh, you dumb moll. Look, when two people make it to the big crashing ‘O’, well, that’s it, baby. That’s what it’s all about. Oh. lt’s objective, it’s empirical, and that, baby, is what the world needs. An end to crap. Back to the orgasm. Nature’s answer to the drug menace. There is a lot of truth in what you say. Look, you can forget Clyde, forget Tony. You and l are now cohabiters. Oh, Stork. Oh, look, follow the truth in your body, Anna. You’re now my woman. lwish it were as simple as that, Stork, but the fact is, the physical side of things isn’t really all that important. Hey, wait a minute! Do you mean to say that... In all fairness, Stork, l have to admit that I’ve already found a type of fulfilment with... Clyde and Tony? Well, mm-hm. So the way it was tonight had nothing to do with a feeling between us? Of course it did. Or with my virility? Of course it did, but... But what? I’m the type of woman who... responds to men. Oh, charming! I guess I must be wired up the right way. If you don’t mind... | just thought it would be best if I told the truth. No, go on. | feel great. Stork, all I’m trying to say is that I don’t set much store by the purely physical. Gee, if I did lwouldn’t look past Clyde ’cause as far as pure technique goes he... Technique? Oh, well, he is very experienced. And Tony — while he sometimes expresses himself in rather devious ways... I didn’t realise I was up against such a talented opposition. It isn’t the technicalities, Stork. It’s the person. (Sighs) You’ve dealt a death blow to my masculinity, Anna — a death blow. It may never rise again. Stork. Yeah? I want us to go on. Believe me. Yeah. But for the time being, it might be best if the others didn’t know. (GENTLE MUSIC) Don’t worry. lwouldn’t be game to tell them. I really love you, Stork. Yeah. And I really love Clyde. And even poor old hung-up Tony. What about Westy? Who told you about Westy? Westy! Oh, God, moll! Well, | feel a great love for the people I’m closest to, Stork. It’d be wrong to hold it back. Wouldn’t it? If you keep not holding it back so often, one of these days someone’s gonna call you promiscuous. ( LAIDBACK GUITAR MUSIC) As I recall, the arrangement was for one night only. He’s been here six months. I don’t think we’ll ever get rid of the bastard. Stork, play your bloody card. I’m thinking. Takes a while to go from brain to hand. Takes a fair while to find the brain too. Play one of the nice ones, Stork, with the pictures on it. Playing cards? No. WESTY: We’re going on a train trip. Would you like a cup of coffee? No, thanks. There. TONY: Oh-ho-ho! Very good. WESTY: Did you have a club, Stork? Yeah, lwas sa...saving it. (Westy laughs) Will you be playing cards long? No. (Tony laughs) Good, l...well... What? I’d like to say a few words. Mind if we finish our game first? Of course not. Thank you. I think something’s up. ( PLATES CLA'I'I'ER LOUDLY) Finished? Hang on. Well, the fact is, something’s come up... ..or will come up shortly. You’re pregnant! You’re on the pill. I stopped. Why? | just stopped. Well, you don’t just stop taking the pill. Well, I did. CLYDE: Why? Why do you think? I don’t know. Neither do |. Are you pregnant? Yes, I am. Well, whose is it? How would I know? TONY: Well, you’ll just have to have an abortion. Why would I have to have an abortion? Because you will. Clyde and I will go halves. I’m not going to. TONY: Not a backyard job. We’ll get the best surgeon in the game. I’m not going to. Well, how far gone are you? Six weeks. Well, there’s no problems. We’ve got a family friend who’s a top obstetrician. I’m not having an abortion! Why not? I’m going to have it. Ah, you’re going to have it adopted? I’m gonna keep it. For God’s sake, woman, be reasonable. CLYDE: You wanna keep it? That’s what I said. Don’t get mad at me. I’m not getting mad at you! You are. What do you want us to do? That’s up to you. Thanks. That’s a great help. I’m sorry! CLYDE: Look, Anna... What do you want us to do? I don’t want you to do anything. Look, let’s just be realistic. You have gone and got yourself pregnant for some bloody obscure reason. You don’t know whose it is. What do you expect us to do? Toss for the kid? It’s my baby. Then what are we supposed to do? “What are we supposed to do?" It’s a fair enough question. Do what you bloody well like. Look, lwouldn’t mind. If it was my kid I’d take responsibility. However, it does dull the edge a bit knowing it could be Clyde’s. No offence, Clyde. I don’t think it matters whose kid it is. Well, I think it does to some extent. I don’t think it matters whose kid it is. lt mightn’t be either of yours. What?! Well, if we’re gonna get all hung-up on parentage, then it could be Stork’s. Stork’s? WESTY: Stork’s?! You slept with...? When did that...? You must be joking. Stork? Are you on the level? It could be Westy’s too. I don’t think that’s very likely. Have you been to bed with Stork and Westy? Not very often...with me. Yes, l have. So what? So what? So what?! You’re a bloody nymphomaniac! It only happened once...and a half. You little bloody rat. What about Stork? Stork’s a mental defective... You think you own her?! When was the last time it happened?! You’re making a mountain out of a molehill! Oh, thanks! Sorry. I didn’t mean it that way. Honestly, Anna. Stork and Westy? Yeah, what was it? ‘Be Kind To Dumb Animals’ week? Oh! Can’t you take it? You’ve been sniggering under your breath for months. I ought to smash your face! What about Stork? I’ll tell you what, I’m not stopping round here to father something that could look like...that. What” your father say? I don’t know and I don’t care. Anna, you’ll just have to face up to the fact ..with four fathers. You conformist bastard. Shut your neck, Stork. Watch your language, Father! I’ll kill him! I’ll kill him! We could all stay here. The more father figures a kid has, the better adjusted he is. CLYDE: Shut your neck! You just can’t accept that Anna finds me attractive. (Laughs) For Christ’s sake, face up to yourself for once. Look, I don’t need any of you! I can look after myself. CLYDE: Something’s gotta be done. (WHIMSICAL BLUEGRASS MUSIC) God, have you ever seen anything as stupid as a bloody sheep? (Sheep bleats) I’m not saying. (Clyde laughs) Go on. Get lost, you dumb, woolly bastard! Get lost! Alright. (Sheep bleats) (Sheep bleats) Oh, bugger! I cut my bloody hand on its horn. Dumb animal! Hey! It’s not moving. What have you done to it, Stork? Nothing. Look what it did to me. Bloody near gored me. lt’s dead! Ooh, you’ve given it a bloody seizure, Stork! CLYDE: Stork, do you know how much these things are worth? WESTY: Jesus, it’s dead! Well, couldn’t be much of a bloody sheep anyway if it couldn’t have taken a joke. Bloody dumb animal! Oh, jeez, look at your suit, Stork. Bugger my suit. We’ll have to front in about 10 minutes. Brush it down, will you? So I look pretty for all the alfs? Well, alright. lt’sjust to please the folks. Doesn’t matter if I get a little dust on my suit, does it? I’ve still got that gorgeous 14-carat band in my pocket. lfthat’s how you feel, then fine. It’s a sell-out! Anna doesn’t want it! Anna doesn’t know what she wants. Anna was perfectly happy going along as we were. Well, lwasn’t. You think you’re what Anna’s been looking for all her life, Mr Right? Mr Far bloody Right?! At least I’m not a hopeless... You’re a bourgeois licker of the establishment posterior. As far as I’m concerned, you can stick this ring up your khyber. If that’s the way you feel. It’s the way I feel. Sorry, old cock. I don’t think I can sit through the ceremony either. (Coughs) (Puffs) Thought you’d never ask, old chap. (Bleats) (INDISTINCT CHA'I'I'ER) (Laughs) Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention forjust one moment... I’m sorry to interrupt the eating and the drinking... (Guests groan) ..but I believe I am obliged to say a few words. (Guests cheer) Now, we’re here today to celebrate the marriage of my lovely daughter. (Guests cheer) And l’m...|’m very glad that we’re here today to celebrate the marriage of my lovely daughter because I believe that... ..my lovely daughter will find in...we||, in marriage... STORK ON MEGAPHONE: Testing, testing. Can you hear me? ..happiness that one finds in marriage. (Guests cheer) STORK: Three, four.... Can you hear me? Now, I haven’t known, um... I haven’t known... I haven’t known Clyde for very long, but in the short time l have, l have been very impressed with his attitude to life and with his...with his friends also. STORK: Attention, please. The ceremony you are... Now, one of his friends, Tony... (Laughs) ..Tony. .. (Crowd cheers) ..is here today as best man. I’m pleased to see Tony here today as best man. We’re very pleased indeed. So thank you, Tony. STORK: ..should be banned from any enlightened society along with the chopping block and the chastity belt. What was that? CLYDE: It was nothing. What? ANNA: It’s OK, Dad. Right. I think I’ve said enough, don’t you? GUESTS: Yeah! Good. Righto. So now I’ll hand the floor over to Uncle Jack. (Guests cheer) MAN 1: Jack! MAN 2: There we are. MAN 1: You tell ’em, Jack. MAN 3: Onya, Jack. There we are. I’m one of the very few men who can claim the privilege of having seen Anna without a stitch of clothing on. (Guests laugh) (Clears throat) Today is the day, good people, when innocence blossoms into womanhood. STORK: Ladies and gentlemen... (Men roar) STORK: Like the monarchy, like the law, marriage is a hangover from the past. JACK: We are witnessing a solemn pledge today. Marriage enslaves women and castrates men. Man to woman, woman to man, to have and to hold. I’m sure there will be lots of having and holding if Clyde’s got any sense, because he’s getting the finest bit of selective breeding we’ve ever seen up Eltham way. STORK: Attention. Marriage is a jackboot on the fragile neck of human... JACK: Look at her, ladies and gentlemen. STORK: You are witnessing a farce. Marriage is a cancer of the revolutionary womb. JACK: Just look at her. STORK: A symbol of servitude... JACK: Clear of eye, proud of head. STORK: ..the chains men used to lead away their wives in the slave market. JACK: Long of flank. Round of rump. STORK: Marriage makes harlotry legal. JACK: As I stand here now, looking at Anna, in her symbolic gown of pristine white, um... ..it makes me feel that... STORK: Marriage is repressive. JACK: Makes me... Why should every couple occupy the straight and narrow bed? It is an invasion of our privacy by the state. What on earth’s going on? STORK: Who says that in future we won’t sleep three in a bed, five in a bed or even 16 in a bed? This is not a personal vendetta. It’s a calculated gesture of protest against an insidious institution. (ROLLICKING MUSIC) Where’s the fire? There’s no bloody fire. Don’t you believe it, Jack. If those CFA boys start hosing, there’s a fire. Might be in the kitchen. I would like to read to you a few selected quotes from the works of Marcuse. “This society is irrational. “lts productivity is destructive of the free development “of human needs and faculties." Back, you highfalutin, bourgeois dogs! “lts peace is maintained by the constant threat of war “and its growth is dependent on repression. “Inner freedom is a private space in which man may become himself. “Today this private space has been invaded and whittled down “by technological reality. “Mass production and mass distribution “claim the entire individual.” Quick! Resistance! You capitalist pigs! Alright! Stop! You’re done! STORK: I’m sorry for the inconvenience, but there comes a time when one cannot shift the system from within and one must resort to violence to make one’s point. Alright, West, let them have it. (Guest shout and squeal) We’ve run out of bloody water, Stork. What?! We’ve run out of bloody water. Westy-boy, I think I might just shoot through. (ROLLICKING MUSIC CONTINUES) (Stork yells) Run! Run! (Anna sighs) Lovely wedding. Stupid bastards. Where the hell do you suppose they got that fire engine? I might have known they’d pull something. You know that great lanky bastard half-killed a sheep this morning? Really? Must have had a weak heart to begin with. Stork! Watch the road, you stupid bastard! (TYRES SCREECH) Get out. Now, wait a minute... Get out! I’ve got my rights. Stork, this is our honeymoon. That could be my kid in there. STORK: Do you get many cases of tetanus round here, Anna? That bloody sheep had a go at me. Bloody lockjaw would be a hell of a thing to get. Just imagine. Hey, did you know that? There’s no known cure. It’s the 20th bloody century and they still haven’t found an antitoxin.
