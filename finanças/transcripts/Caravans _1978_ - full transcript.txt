Excuse me. Hey, get out of here! Mullahs. Come on, damn it. Beat it! They'll kill you. Beat it! Mr. Ambassador, another dispatch from Senator Jasper. I thought you'd like the file. Oh, uh, thank you, Miss Merwyn. Good morning, Mr. Richardson. Morning. Well... Uh, the senator's a persistent old cuss, isn't he? He'll have our hides if we don't find his daughter. Well, we've done some checking. She was last seen in Bandahar 10 months ago. Oh, great. Great. An American girl disappears, the best Intelligence could do... is tell me where she was, uh, 10 months ago. Crandall, this is the Middle East, not Omaha, Nebraska. And this is 1948, not the Dark Ages. Washington will not buy excuses. Washington doesn't know what the hell it's asking. - Yes, sir. - Send in Miller. The ambassador wants you. I remember an incident about a year ago, an English girl... She reported to her embassy that she was being mistreated by her husband's other wives. The British intervened, knowing damn well that in this country... a wife is the property of her husband. Turned into a real can of worms. The British came off looking bad. Come in, Miller. We heard about that incident at the bazaar. I have to give you credit for doing some quick thinking. Thank you, sir. Now, during your short stay here, you haven't seen much of this exotic country, have you? There's a job to be done in Bandahar. Tim Woods is on leave, so I'm sending you. I want you to find this girl and send me a report on her. - What's her name? - Ellen Jasper. You'll have to be discreet. Our position here is delicate. I'll be careful. Bandahar's on the eastern border where there's been trouble, so you'll need permission from Sardar Khan to go there. All the information we have on that girl is in this file. Study it. Find her. And bring me a report on her so I can get the senator off my back. Play your cards right, and he can do a lot for your career. I'll set up an appointment for you to see Sardar Khan. Thank you, sir. Good luck. Excellency. Mr. Miller. My apologies for the delay. Well, I'm sure your business with the Indian ambassador... was much more pressing than mine. He complains that Russian guns are passing through my country... for use against India in her war with Pakistan. And, of course, the Russian gentleman denies it. Uh, most emphatically. He's always rather a difficult man to deal with, but, of course, his country is helping us to build a hydroelectric dam, which we very badly need. Would you care for some tea? Yes, thank you. Well, Mr. Miller, what assistance can I offer you? I'm trying to locate a young woman. A very natural desire for one of your age. No, this is an official request on behalf of my government. The lady's name is Ellen Jasper. She's the daughter of Senator Jasper. Oh, yes. A very eminent man in your country, I believe. Mm-hmm. He's most anxious about her. Children can be a heavy burden. We believe she's living in Bandahar, but we've been unable to contact her. Did you know that the young lady in question... had crossed the Khyber Pass, alone, on a donkey, to follow the man that she loved? Remarkable young woman. You know her then? Colonel Nazrullah, the man that she followed and married, is my nephew. Oh, please forgive me. I had no idea. We have no intention of intruding on your private... Mr. Miller, I can grant you permission to travel, but it is the husband's decision to grant you an interview. You see, the women in our country are under slightly different rules... from those in yours. Outsiders sometimes find this a little difficult to understand. We keep our women in seclusion, covered and lacking the rights of a camel, and yet we dedicate most of our poetry to them. Our customs may differ, but a parent's anxiety must be shared by both our cultures. I would like to be able to reassure Senator Jasper and his wife. I trust that you will be able to do just that. The travel documents to Bandahar will be delivered to your embassy tomorrow morning. Thank you. Please. The green one's for water, and the red one's for gas. Gotcha. And don't get 'em mixed up. With only three jeeps in commission, I don't need another gas tank full of water. Right. Oh. And keep your butt in the jeep or near it at all times. And sleep under it. That way you'll know when they steal it. And, uh, Miller, a jeep is a hell of a lot more expensive than a bicycle. Yeah, I bet. Salaam alaikum. Salaam. Ooh, ah. Excuse me. I'm... Um... Um... "Badek." There. Badek. "Badek." There? Badek. Ah. That's just what I thought. Hey, you, get away from there. Go on, beat it. Do you speak English? I want to go to Badek. Badek. There, or there? Badek, Badek, Badek. Badek. Badek.Badek.Badek. Okay, kid, come with me. Come on. Get in. Get in. You know what you are, kiddo? A delinquent. A regular Ali Baba. I bet you could take my eyes out and I wouldn't even know it. Oh, well. Since we've got them, let's not compound the crime by wasting 'em. Let's eat. Eat. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Not with that. Here. You like that, huh? It's all right. Keep it. No, no, no. Keep it. It's yours. Yeah. - Huh? - Keep it. It's yours. Huh? Yeah, it's yours. Ah, cut that out, will you? Kochi. Huh? Kochi. No Kochi. Badek. Mr. Miller, from America? Salaam alaikum. Nur Mohammad, chief of police. No papers, please. This one here guards your jeep for only three dollars. That one over there guards your room for three dollars. Go. Here we are. Come with me. See? The very best. Are these men really necessary? If one thing is missing, I shoot them both, and your six dollars American is returned. Tonight, we eat together. On me. Okay, huh? Yeah, okay. It's like American restaurant, yes? Sugar, please. Thank you. Salaam alaikum. Tell me, where did you learn English? For two years, I work with American army captain. - You knew I was coming. - I know everything. I know when you come, and I know when you go. Then you must know Colonel Nazrullah. I know him. He is a great man. He's going to help our country become modern, like America. Have you seen his wife? It's not permitted to look on another man's wife. Do you know if she's with him at Bandahar? Of course. A wife is with her husband all the time. That's the law. Try this. This is excellent. Hmm. Uh, no. No. It is our custom to eat with the right hand. We never bring the left hand to the table. Oh, excuse me. I didn't... You know, I was thinking, it must be very difficult for a woman from my country... to be married here. To make that adjustment, it must be something. And you say Colonel Nazrullah's wife is with him at Bandahar? Dancing. We go watch now. Come. Kochi musicians from the caravan. Oh, yes. The people in the black tents. How come there's no women? It is forbidden. Such entertainment is for men only. The boy is evil. There will be trouble. Hmm. Who are they, more Kochis? They are called the free people. Why? Because they don't pay for anything? No, because they belong to no country, only themselves. But that will change. Good night, Mr. Miller. Good night. Hey, what's goin' on? They pray all who see will remember the laws of the prophet. I don't understand. A man was stabbed to death last night. There was a fight for the favor of the Kochi dancer. Not him. I know him. Mmm. They ask, will the government punish this man? The government is not concerned... with crimes of passion. He's entitled to a fair trial. Stay out, Mr. Miller. No trial. There were witnesses. There is no question of guilt, only of punishment. He's the father of the murdered boy. Filthy bastards. What you saw is justice. What I saw was cold-blooded murder! Our laws have come to us over a thousand years, Mr. Miller. You must be very wise to dismiss them so quickly. Passport. Oh. I'm looking for a Colonel Nazrullah. Nazrullah. Colonel Nazrullah. I understand. My brother will take you. It is not far. Masood. Thanks, kid. I would like to see Colonel Nazrullah, or his wife, Ellen Jasper, a Ferangi woman. Sahib, you want Ferangi woman? Yes. I'm trying to find this woman. You pay. I teach you. Ten dramin. That woman? You're sure it's this woman? Okay. I'll pay you five now and five later. Okay. Okay. Come on. In there? This woman? In there? Hello? Ellen Jasper? Miss Jasper? Ellen? Can I talk to you? Ellen, are you all right? Ellen? Okay. Take it easy, pal. Take it easy. This way. My dear Mr. Miller, my profoundest apologies. Colonel. Oh, I am sorry. First, a brandy. Then I will send for the doctor. Oh, please, don't bother. It's just a few scratches. Such a thing should not have happened... while you were under the protection of my house. I should have known better. I knew of your arrival, of course, but I expected you to send me a note. Ah. Well, I must accept full responsibility for what happened. That's very gracious of you. Let me send a car to your hotel for a change of clothes. Oh, no, please, that won't be necessary. Well, is there no small service I can do? This is fine. Brandy's excellent. And how is your Mr. Richardson? It's some time since I have seen him. He's fine, thank you. You've had a very eventful journey from Kashkhan? Yes, in one way and another. Oh, I'm sorry you witnessed that incident at Badek. I would hardly call it an incident. I can't say that I care very much for your system of justice. My country and its customs are very old and well tested. But they are not arbitrary. What I saw was very arbitrary. But logical. Do you know why we cut off the right hand of a thief? No doubt that's logical too? Yes. We eat with the right hand. The left hand is for the toilet. To lose your right hand is to be banished from the sharing of food. The thief loses more than his hand. And you approve of that? No, Mr. Miller, I do not. There are a few of us who realize what has to be done, but, uh, we have to deal with, uh, backward people, narrow-minded mullahs, lawless nomads... You know, the land must be reclaimed. Dams must be built. We need schools. We need... That's a tall order. You must excuse me, Mr. Miller, but I get carried away. Oh. My son, Elgabri. Hello. Ah. Come and meet Mr. Miller, my dear. My wife Karima. Welcome to our home, Mr. Miller. Oh, thank you. You are injured, Mr. Miller. You should see a doctor. We have an English one. He's well qualified. He attends to all of us. Well, thank you, but it's nothing serious. If you'll excuse me, Mr. Miller. I hope your trip to Bandahar is a pleasant one. Thank you. Please, Mr. Miller. Your wife is very beautiful. Yes, thank you. We are allowed more than one wife. Since you seem to know so much about me, I presume you know the purpose of my mission. My uncle Sardar Khan informed me. I'm sorry. It is not possible. My request is simple. Just a short interview. Ellen has no desire to talk to you. Well, naturally, if she tells me so, then I will... I tell you so. There has been no communication from her in 10 months. Senator Jasper is... I have met Senator Jasper, and I know all about his position. He didn't take to me, and I didn't take to him. Using his name will not help you. Colonel, this is an official request from my ambassador regarding an American citizen. Listen, when Ellen married me, she gave up all rights as an American. Under our laws, I now speak for her. Do you understand? I thought you were progressive. You will inform your ambassador... that I deeply resent this intrusion into my private life. Now go back to your embassy, Mr. Miller. Excuse me. Yes? I need a doctor. There's an English doctor in Bandahar. English. I understand. Uh, Masood? Doctor... What's the matter? I've injured my hand. I was wondering if you could have a look at it. Come in. Come in. Thank you. If you'll just excuse me for a minute, PM... I'll deal with this chap. Come in, please. Please, come in. Now, please, uh, do s-sit down. Sit down. Thank you. What was the fuss about? Oh, he was worried about his wife. Thought you might have designs on her. Well, you see, my problem is this. I'm not allowed to examine her. She tells him her symptoms. Then he gives me some garbled version. I make a guess and then prescribe. If the apothecary charges too much for the medicine, he won't buy it. Then she continues to suffer, greatly, and in silence. Still, let's, uh... let's have a look at that hand. Yeah. Now, does that hurt? No. No? Good. All right, turn it over. Bend your fingers up like that. Yeah, go on. Good. It really is a great pleasure to have a chance to speak English again. You've no idea what it's like to live your life exiled from your mother tongue. Nothing broken. Do you speak English with Colonel Nazrullah? Oh, you... you know the colonel. We've met. Look, uh, PM... I'll give you this to help it along. Uh, he's a friend of yours, is he? My concern is more with his wife. Oh, yes, of course, it would be. You are Ellen's doctor? I've attended her once or twice. What are you doing here? I'm from the American Embassy. Hmm? I was sent here to find Ellen Jasper... on the express orders of the ambassador himself. And you've... already talked to Nazrullah? Yes. I'm surprised he'd discuss it. I suppose he had to with you. Came on your own, did you? Yes. You Americans really are extraordinary. How long are you staying? Couple of days. Incredible arrogance. Still, I suppose that's what makes you fellows what you are. Nazrullah has combed this country for 10 months, and he hasn't found a trace of her. You think you're gonna find her in a couple of days? She's been missing for 10 months? Oh, Christ. I assumed you knew. Nazrullah will have my head for this. I'm sorry, but you've tricked me into being indiscreet about one of my patients. Bullshit. I came here about my hand. Where or when was she last seen? I'm saying nothing further. Good God, man. Best kept secret in Bandahar. Who saw her last? I did. I... I was on a health inspection... some villages up near the mountains. A job Nazrullah gave me. Ellen and I spent a couple of days in one village, and then I was going on to another. Well, she persuaded me to allow her to remain where she was until I returned. When I got back, she was gone. Where is this village? Please, don't meddle. Oh, God. Hey. - You American? - Yes. Do you speak English? Why? You prefer Chinese? Russian? Maybe Turkish. Who is this? That's Ellen Jasper, the wife of Colonel Nazrullah. She's an American citizen who's disappeared. My government has sent me to find her. A government sends you into the desert to look for a woman? Yes. And you expect me to believe that? Yes. American. A man has come. He is looking for Ellen Jasper. Who? He has a letter... from the Khan. Do you know him? No, I've never seen him before. Why would he carry your picture? Oh, my God. Bryn Mawr, '41. A school picture. Hmm. My father sent him. Maybe your husband sent him. If Nazrullah knew I was here, he'd come personally... to cut your throat. Huh? Who is it? Ellen Jasper. Yes. I never expected to find you here. Where did you expect to find me? I'm not sure really. Who are these people? The Kochi. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? I tried to explain that last night to, um... The leader, Zulffiqar. Yeah, him. Yeah. The embassy has sent me to find you. Don't they have anything better to do? They sure as hell do. Well, no one invited you here, Mr. Miller. But now that you've found me, you can go back and report... that I'm alive, well... and living with the Kochi, entirely of my own free will. Okay? No, it's not okay. Hey! What about my jeep? I have to get to Bandahar. Oh... Damn. Do not blame the rope. It is you. What does the American want? He just came for me, that's all. That is all, huh? He, uh... He upset you? No, he... he just reminds me of things I wanna forget. Has he come to take you back? I suppose that's what they'd like. Ellen. Ellen. If you want to go, you go. With us, uh, you are... You're free. I know that. I came here because I wanted to, and I'll go when I want to. They can't make me. Suppose he brings soldiers? I doubt that. Ellen, I don't like doubts. Maybe I should kill him now. I would feel better. No. Just leave him alone. Out here in this sun he will die anyway. Hey, I've gotta talk to you. Now wait a minute. You're not gonna leave me here. I'm not leaving you. I'm going with the caravan. You're free to do whatever you want. The people are concerned. They're not used to being followed. I know. This man... This man won't give up. It's my fault. He's here because of me. I don't want to cause any problems. Why don't... Ask him to join the camp. Why? Always you must have reasons. Yes. I wanna know. I-I don't... The sun will not kill him. Will you let me shoot him? No. Then ask him to join the camp. - But... - Go on. You must be hungry. Yes, I am. It's called “naan.” We bake it over dried camel dung. It's good. Zulffiqar says you can stay with the caravan. Well, thanks a lot. Thank Zulffiqar, Mr. Miller. The name's Mark. You're always walking away. You walk away from your parents. You walked out on your husband. When I try to talk to you... Look, my life isn't your concern. Yeah, you're right. It's not my concern. I just don't understand why you're so inconsiderate towards your parents. You're making an awful lot of assumptions. What do you want from me? A letter. Some kind of explanation. An explanation. All right. How about this? "Dear Mom and Dad," I left Nazrullah because he traded our dream for... power. Now I'm living with a wonderful man... who's never taken a bath. He has no home, no stock portfolio, no responsibilities except for a bunch of nomads, twenty-seven camels, sheep and goats. "I have a terrific tan. Love, Ellen." How's that? It doesn't sound very loving. I'm sorry you're in the middle of this, but you don't know the facts. My parents were using me for their... respectability. And I won't be used by anyone. It's as simple as that. Okay, Miller? Yeah, okay. I like your word "okay." Okay. Okay. It is difficult to understand your reluctance... to terminate your marriage with this, uh, American woman. The disgrace to our family cannot be allowed to continue. Mr. Richardson. Your Excellency. You know my nephew, I believe. Of course. Colonel? Do sit down. The colonel has brought me some very interesting news. Your embassy claims to have lost a diplomat, and my soldiers claim to have seen one. I have a confirmed report that Mark Miller is with a Kochi caravan. Why, that's inconceivable. Surely there must be some reason. You will explain why a representative of the United States government... is traveling with the nomads. My last report had him visiting your home, Colonel, concerning another disappearance. My wife's involvement in this matter is not your concern! It seems that the colonel's wife and your Mr. Miller... are traveling together with the same caravan. However, this is not just a matter of lost wives and missing diplomats. The nomads are engaged in gunrunning, and I do not propose to be embarrassed by it. Now if you will excuse me, I have an appointment. Matters of state, you understand. Your Excellency. Good day. 200. Huh? The old man asked me a question. I cannot answer. Some questions don't have answers. No, no. I... I am the leader. I must have answers. What's the problem? Come here. Do you, uh... Do you see a line down there? Huh? The soldiers say there is one. Last night they come. They take the old man's sheep and goat. They said the old man crossed the line. He crossed the border. To sheep and goats grass is the same on either side. Ah, but not to men. The soldiers say, "If you cannot see the line, you are mad, or you are blind." Now, what do I say to the old man? Do I say he is mad or he is blind? Huh? Well, I would say... that they're the ones who are mad... to make borders where they shouldn't exist. Yeah, I have to be careful. You are getting as smart as me. I don't know, maybe... Maybe smarter. Mmm. I have a good teacher. Salaam, Maftoon. Salaam! How are you? No! No, no. Leave them alone. This happens all the time. It's a running feud. Watch how they make up. It's a trick all the camel drivers use... Let them fight the clothes instead of the man. Oh. You know, you puzzle me, Ellen. Why? Well, you seem to be at home here, but yet you don't belong. Oh, but I do. I do belong. Don't you miss the States? What, Dorset, Pennsylvania? The country club set? Political rallies? No, I don't miss it. Moheb. Welcome back. Did they show you the land? Yes, they showed me the land. Hah, hah. Who's that? Zulffiqar's son. Father. Father. Moheb is here. Moheb. Moheb? Yes. Where? Moheb, yes. Hey, Son. Hey, it's good to have you back. Who is the Ferangi outside? Oh, his name is, uh... Is Miller. He's an American. He, uh... American? He's come to find Ellen. Ellen? Mmm. Ellen. The American could be a spy. Right. And that is why I am keeping him. As long as Ellen is with us, we'll never be safe. She's still Nazrullah's wife. Son, I am the leader, and that is my problem. Hey, Son, it's good to have you back. Come here. Come on. Sit down. Sit down. Hey, you must be hungry. It was a long ride. Give him some tea. So, tell me, you, uh... Yes, yes, yes. You, uh... You saw the, uh, government land, huh? And how is it? Is it beautiful? Is it nice? We'll see it tomorrow. It's close by. No, you saw it. What... What do you think? You must decide. You're right. I will decide. So, this is the land, huh? The whole valley. And they expect the Kochi to settle here? Son, we have other choices. I will meet Shakkur in the village. His offer must be better than this. There is a stream up ahead. Oh, there is water? Let's go. And they call this a stream? I can piss more than this. The government promises to bring in water from the mountains. Promises. And you believe a government's promise? It's not the land, is it? It's the thought of settling that troubles you, and always has. Ho. Our people have never belonged to one place, one country. They never have, and never will. You never will. But one day soon there'll be nowhere left to go. The borders are closing. The railroads are coming. Soon there'll be no need for the caravan. Until that time comes, Son, we'll take care of our people. How? By becoming thieves and scavengers? Son, you sound like Nazrullah. Come on. Maftoon. Moheb, go on into the village for supplies. Take three men. Ellen. You cover yourself. And you, Miller... You stay out of sight. I wish someone would tell your friend that he isn't God. He knows that, but our people think he is. So, my friend, what is it? Mmm. I have a very important merchandise for you to transport. Yes? What? Guns. Shakkur, I don't carry guns. I mean, if I'm caught, it could be the end of my tribe. You will not be caught. To be delivered where? I will tell you at Qualir. Many tribes will be there to trade and celebrate. Bring your Kochi to join us. Mahmoud! Hey! Damn you! Salaam. Salaam. I am Zulffiqar, sir. I am the leader of this caravan. What... What seems to be the problem? What can I do for you, sir? I have my orders to search your caravan. Search us? Why do you badger us? What have we done to you? We are a poor tribe. We have just stopped here to buy some supplies. You brigands bring us nothing but... Why do you call us brigands? Whatever... Ah! Who struck my daughter? Huh? Who is this man? This man? Oh, this man, sir... We hardly know him, sir. Uh, we-we found him. He was lost. He was lost out in the middle of the desert, sir. I am an American. I'm from the United States embassy in Kashkhan. Oh, yes? Yes. It seems that they have found something interesting. Shall we have a look? What could they find, sir? We have nothing, sir. What could they possibly find? What's all this? Oh, those are scraps of tin and iron and some useless... That's my jeep. I can see it's a jeep. What is it doing on the back of a Kochi camel? Well, we-we found it... It's in transit. My jeep broke down in the desert. This man is giving me and the jeep a lift. In another village, a Kochi was seen in the bazaar selling parts. Well, they're just small, unimportant parts. We were, uh... With my permission, to cover the freight costs. Do you have your papers to identify yourself? Zulffiqar. Huh? Show him my papers. Oh, of course, of course. His papers. My passport and the travel document. You do recognize the signature of the Sardar Khan? Yes, sir. I, uh... If I were you, Captain, I would call off this search. Yes, sir. You did well, almost as good as me. Now I'm in debt to you. You bastard. You stole my jeep. No, I didn't steal it. I was keeping it for you... as a surprise. Moheb, did you see the miracle of those papers, huh? Uh, Miller, I'll keep those for you, huh? Oh, no, you don't. Oh, I'm sorry to say, we have some thieves. Please. Oh, no, come. I'll keep them. You could've gone with them. Why didn't you? I don't like the way they treat your people. Mmm. Besides, I was sent on a mission to find you. But you've found me. Oh, yeah, sure. What proof do I have? What do I say? That I've seen you and you're fine? Yes. I don't have one tangible piece of evidence.

I'm trying to write my parents a letter. That is easy, if you can write. Not really. Maybe you can help me. How? Well, you've been a nomad all your life. Could you... give it up and settle down? Oh, I am too old to change my ways. My feet would no longer feel the desert trails. In a village, my camels would forget the taste of mountain grass. My grandson... would never know how Allah... moved the stars and the moon across the sky. Why don't you write it. Do they read Pashto? Hah! What is it? Soldiers. Where? Over the hill, in the valley. We wait. Bring the caravan. We go east, to Qualir. Why are we stopping? It is your husband, Colonel Nazrullah. Ho! Ho! Ho! Hey! Shakkur. Salaam, Zulffiqar. Salaam. How were things in Russia? Oh, it was a smooth passage. I wish I could say the same. Listen, uh... Zulffiqar, who is she? Oh, uh, she's, uh... She's, uh, a Kochi. A blonde Kochi? Yeah. Strange, huh? Here are the reins. Oh, uh, who is the man? Oh, well, he... He's an American. A diplomat. Oh, you are crazy. No, no, no, no, no. You bring Americans to Qualir. I will show you. You know the cargo. You see? Why are you late? There were soldiers. We took the eastern passage. Soldiers, police. Hah! They're everywhere these days. Like lice. Mm-hmm. May the wombs of their mothers dry up. May their fathers' rifles drop off. Your American, he still worries me. He knows nothing about our business. He is my passport. But this time our cargo did not travel alone. They sent two Russians with it. Huh. And you bring Russians to Qualir? My friend, we have no choice. We do business where we can. Times have changed. Mmm. Zulffiqar. Mmm? Is she really Kochi? Hmm? Hmm? Hmm? Really. We lost them in the mountains. They must have traveled only at night. Well, you've got to hand it to them. They're clever. Not so clever. I have reason to believe they will return soon. Oh? But your Mr. Miller seems to have joined these Kochi for a vacation. Maybe your wife has, but... Don't talk about my wife. I told you before. I'm sorry, Colonel. That wasn't very tactful of me. I understand how you must feel. No, Mr. Richardson. You will never understand that. What I was trying to say was, if Miller stayed with the Kochis, maybe he stumbled onto something. Something that might be of value to both of our countries. But he still gets no message to you. Well, possibly, at this stage it's too dangerous. If we hear anything, I'll keep you informed. I may not be able to wait that long. Hey! Hey! Hey! Miller. Why don't you dance? No, no. Not me. Go on. The music will show you how. A young man, and you don't dance? Hey, hey! Chicago. What? I see cinema. Oh. You hungry? Yes. Ah! Oh! Miller. What happened? I was attacked. Who did this? I don't know. I couldn't see him. Whoever it was, he wasn't kidding. This is not our people. I will find out. Abu. Abu. Shakkur. Shakkur! No! No! No! No! Drop it. Drop it! I'm all right. Why were you... Why were you fighting? He was attacking Ellen. I'm all right. I'm all right. Did you attack Ellen? No. Now don't lie. Tell me. Did you attack Ellen? Please! He didn't really hurt me. Ellen, you live with us, you live by our laws. Now you know the punishment. Zulffiqar. Hey, Shakkur. Hey, till we meet again, huh? Yeah. The Russians are dead. Perhaps the weather did not agree with them. And one of them was found with his own knife in his belly. His own knife? Yes. Oh, oh, oh. Very careless. Yes, very careless. Zulffiqar? Shakkur. You have only three days to meet the Balochi at Torq. Aw, Torq is a dead city. It's a safe place. Allah and a good wind go with you. And with your people. Ellen, you take the horse. Zulffiqar! Ellen. Ellen. Miller, give me your hand. What the hell is this? Mr. Miller. Put it down. Put it down! The only reason I do not kill you now, Mr. Miller, is because of my father. How are the people? They are well. Miller has seen the guns. So? I think we should kill him. Moheb... Salaam. Moheb thinks I should kill you. Do you always do what your son tells you to? One day he will command. No, Zulffiqar. When you die, the Kochi will vanish. Do you think my people are weak? No, they are strong, but they need a leader. And now... you have your doubts about me, huh? No. In a different time, under different circumstances, you could be a great leader. But now you are being used. Well, it's easy for you to talk. I understand America is a land of miracles. My people have no miracles. They only have me. It is not miracles, Zulffiqar, it is guns. Kill me if you wish. I will think about It. Moheb. Where are the Balochi? Maybe... Maybe in the village. I don't like it. Place some guards. Any sign? It's a city of shadows. I will not wait long. Tell the people not to unload. Zulffiqar picks cheerful places to meet his friends. Quiet. Damn it. Everybody out of sight. Zulffiqar. Zulffiqar. I am Zulffiqar. And I am Colonel Nazrullah. Ahh. Salaam. I'd imagined you... different. How? I don't know. More, uh... More fearsome. You're a very, very young man. I'm not feared by the people who live by our laws. We have our, uh... Our own laws. You wait here for the Balochi. They will not come. We have stopped their caravan. And you have crossed the desert to, uh, give me this message? You have an American diplomat with you. I have orders from his embassy to take him back. And that is why you have come? And that is all? Give us Miller. Mr. Miller! You have a visitor. Colonel. I have orders for you from your embassy. One moment, please. It's official. My marching orders. With us, you have learned to march. Be wise. Get rid of the guns. What guns? Oh. Here. Your papers. I don't think they will help now. Get in the jeep. Good luck. And now we'll examine your cargo. Why do you wish to examine my scraps and rags? Poor things we-we use for-for trade. Russian guns! He-He's lying. Would I carry Russian guns? We will examine your cargo. Well, then, come. I will show you. If I carried Russian guns, I would be a rich man, instead of leading a miserable tribe, stopping in villages to sell... And now we will take your cargo. Start the caravan. You will regret this. I never regret. Besides, you gave me no choice. Like other tribes... You have been offered land. I saw the land you offered me. You expect us to trade our pride and freedom... for land that lizards would spit on. Your people will pay for your pride. You pay for everything. Zulffiqar. Listen. You do have something that's not yours. My wife. I want to see her. Where is she? Ellen. Ellen. I have come to take you home, Ellen. This is my home now. Listen, Ellen. I am a proud man. My family want me to divorce you, but I want you back again as my wife. Impossible. Why? Because I don't trust you. But you must come with me. No. I must be true to my beliefs. I'm sorry. Please, Ellen. Do not go with them. I wish you understood. Ellen? Now I'm really free. Good. But now you can never go back. I know. Okay, Miller? Yeah. Okay. I hope you find what you're looking for. Oh, I have, Mark. I have. You too, huh? Oh. You'll need this. For your parents? To whom it may concern. The tangible evidence you wanted. Thanks. I'll miss you, Mark. Stop the firing. You shall not interfere. I damn well can. You're slaughtering helpless people. I'm going to report it. You tell Moheb to watch their back. You murderous idiot. You're ruining your country just to get even with the Kochi. Or is it your wife? Mira! Mira. Why do they stop firing? I don't know, Son. It may be a trick. Zulffiqar. Surrender. Give up your cargo. We will not surrender. We do not give up the cargo. I swear, if we do not, they will kill all of us. Give back the cargo. Son, it is our life. Look, what do we have? It is your only choice. Give back the rifles. All right. Be careful. We'll give up the cargo, but we go free. Ag reed. Ellen. Ellen! Ellen. You came for your wife? Here she is. Son. - You lead the caravan. - Not yet. You lead.
