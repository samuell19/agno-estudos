Come on, superstars! Come on, quick, move your arses! Come on, I won't hurt you! Over there! Stand in the line! You too, don't just stand there staring! Move! Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? Because if I didn't do it, someone else would do it but much worse. I don't do anything that isn't in demand. These are the times we live in. I'm just trying to adapt. You were in my dream last night. We had children. I think you were my wife. You kissed me. Put it down, put it here. - Don't you want to go home? - I have to go to the cemetery. - Thanks and have a nice day! - You're welcome! God bless you! Look, you're frightening me, Gicu. You look good. I heard that it all went wrong. I'm sorry. Who is she? Your daughter? Gicu, let's calm down and behave like... rational people. Do you think I meant it to happen? No! Your partner cheated you! You know predictions are never that specific. You told me to invest, Rodica. You were quite specific. Yes, because your stars looked so good. You probably ended up avoiding something much worse. Forget the money! You'll get it back in the end. You're right there, Rodica. On Thursday, two weeks from now. From your pretty, little hands. Speaking as a fortune-teller, I wouldn't bet on it. Fifty... plus three zeros. You see? I told you. Your grave is covered in weeds. If your granddaughter should think to visit you, she wouldn't even find your gravestone. Holy Father, I told him not to be buried here, but in the village where he was born. But he wanted an elegant city cemetery. Elegant cemetery, you arsehole! May God have mercy on you. Oh, my dear. I've brought you some flower seeds. I don't understand these young people. A loving kid like her, and her mother throws her away, like chicken bones. What do you think? Should we try to borrow the money? Should I take on more debt? Are you saying I should ask lordache? He's a rich man now. Perhaps it's worth a try. You'll see how sweet they'll smell. They'll be marvellous. Really wonderful. But I have to tell you... that strange things are happening to that girl. You know I don't believe in cards or coffee grounds. But when this girl sleeps, strange things happen. We only take money. Thank you. What's that? Do we take rabbits? - Only cash! - Only cash, sorry. - A chicken? No, no chickens either! - I've got cash! - Take it easy, don't push! - Ana, here... Come, sit here. What's happening? Haven't you heard? The girl projects her dreams... as if you were watching TV. The fee is 10 lei. Hurry, it's about to start! Show me what you've drawn. What is it? Ah, beautiful! Granddad and his band bringing Mummy back home. Take a look at this! How beautifully she's drawn her Granddad with his band. That's fascinating but we didn't come to see her drawings. My granddaughter can draw too. She won a prize. Please be patient. She really isn't used to so many people. Come to bed and lie down nicely. You're such a sweet girl. Give that to me, we'll put it here. Let's get into bed and show these nice people how clever we are. That's right, my dear. Yes, my angel. You're such a good girl. Let's tuck you in nicely. Now we close our eyes. And silence please! Didn't I say that nothing would happen? - Hey, hey! - She's cheating us! I paid 20 lei for this! Please be patient. She needs to get used to the crowd. We've waited long enough. What happens if it takes her all night? My arse is freezing off! Give us our money back, Rodica! Here, a little snooze booze. It'll send you straight to sleep. Give us our money back! Have as much as you like. Bravo! Bravo, you're very clever. Five minutes! Five minutes and she's guaranteed to fall asleep. - Five minutes? - Five minutes! Please! More than five minutes have passed. I've had enough of this! Goodbye! You're making a fool of us! Come on, Ana! Look! Fantastic! What are you doing here, Gigi Paparu? Well, Mona... - I don't believe your story. - You mean I'm not telling the truth? - Have you told anyone else? - No, not yet. You'd better not. I'll pretend I never heard it. - Why? - Let's not take each other for fools, my girl. What will they think at Child Welfare? What? - Do you want your child back? - Yes, I do. Then let's take each other seriously. I want you to tell me what really happened. - I've already told you. - This is an official report not a fairytale, for God's sake! What shall we put in it? What did you actually do there? What did you do in England? Shall we write that your dead father marched a brass band into a Liverpool brothel? Where the prostitutes were characters from literature? Shall we write that? Shall we? How did you meet the child's father? You were sitting on the beach and he jumped out of the sand? That's what happened. A girl like her is picked out straight away. The Italians love kids with darker skin. Five minutes is all it takes for a closed adoption. You'll never see her again. Never again! They won't even send you a photo. Do you want that? Do you? No. Okay, then come on. Let's compose it together. Tell me what really happened to you. I'll help you sum it up, okay? Okay? Okay. How did you meet her father? In the street. Where? In the city. Write it down! And then what happened? Then... What? We hid in a doorway. Then we went to a children's playground. What was his name? He told me a name... and told me... where he worked. I went there the next day but no one knew a man by that name. I went back later but I never found him. - He disappeared. - He disappeared? And? Someone said he was from Regat and he'd gone back there. Viorica... was born in the maternity hospital in town. I raised her alone for three years doing casual jobs. I sold pumpkin seeds at the railway station. I met a man there who... organised girls to work in the sex trade in England. And? I decided to go with him. Why? Money reasons. - Was it your decision to go? - Yes. No. Let's write that he forced her to go. And? I left Viorica in Auntie Rodica's care. I promised to send money. I worked as a prostitute in England. But the wages were atrocious. The rent was high and I had to pay the owner a large percentage. I did it until I got fed up. I also felt very guilty about leaving my daughter, so I came home. Good. I think that's okay now. It'll make a good start. But let's add: "I came back determined to mend my ways, earn a respectable living, and create a healthy mental and physical environment for my child." Sign it, please. That's all. Thank you. I'll see you later. Will I get her back? I can't promise anything. I have to consider the child's interests. But I must admit that I'm not completely satisfied with the situation. I see. Bye. How shall I close the report? Yes... Considering... all the circumstances, in accordance with child protection regulations and considering the child's interests, and also based on... my impressions... after talking personally to the girl's mother, I propose to reinstate the child in the care of her biological mother. Hmmm. This is going to taste wonderful. Pass me your plate. - Four spoons for me. - Four spoons? - Are you sure you can eat that much? - Yes. One... two... - Three... four. - And four. Here you are. Careful, it's hot! - Enjoy! - Thanks! - Well, do you like it? - Yes. Do you want some milk? There you go. - Which story do you want? - The one with the xylophone. The xylophone? All right. Once upon a time, there was a powerful king, who had a huge palace. It was guarded by dead angels and it was deep underground, not far from hell. It had a hundred rooms. And there were a hundred prisoners in the hundred rooms. They were all characters from fairytales, princes and princesses. And the princes and princesses were very sad because they'd been taken from their fairytales. But the children were even sadder when they opened their books and found a jumble of boring words. There was no one they could admire or get excited for, no one they could imagine being before they fell asleep at night. But there was one poor princess among them. And she decided to run away from the palace and return to her fairytale. Written and directed by photography editor original soundtrack sound set design costumes
