That's us. Noone helped us either! Quiet, boys! Is he saying we'll mess with doctors now? What will Minas say? You knew since yesterday? I must be sleepwalking. I'm always the last one to know... Yes... ...and my luck is in! Isn't it? Grandma! Look, grandma! They only had these in white. I got a red one for me, is it okay? Of course, honey. Shall we light them now? No, at night. Now wash and have lunch. Mommy is here, too. Now go and keep quiet, honey. Yes, okay. Bye now. - Hi, mother! - Hurry, you're late! Too hot!... I have to go again in ten minutes. - What's for lunch? - Zoe is already eating. - She's here? - Since one. She finishes earlier now. She was on the phone and said she's going to America. What is this, Minas? You know anything? Zoe! Don't say I told you, she'll be furious again! Zoitsa! Zoe! What's new, woman? Did they lay you off? I have to be back at work in half an hour. Tell me. You do the eating, I'll do the talking. I have to be in Piraeus in thirty. So... Eat and listen. The results from L.A. arrived. Straight... ...from A.P.S. An incredible guy. Who is? Hartman called me. Three choices. Me, Makis and the Cypriot. We're the first team. We're off next Friday, ninety days in Chicago headquarters! Your dear Vaso, she'll come to help too. Did you get a raise? How will you pay Vaso? From the workout fund. I got you there. You're late, too. Be back at eight for the "goodbye party". Zoitsa! Drop the feminist parties... Us two will meet at eight. - Okay? - We've been through this already. Besides, honey... I always get my way. Daddy is here!... Your mother is emigrating, you know that? Your daughter's been invited by a computer. - See, I'm only the husband... - Where to? How can she leave a baby behind? Come my boy, come to grandma... His grandma will feed him, my child... ...whose wretched mother... I know well enough... Eat it, my boy... Eat it, oh my poor child... No brains for motherhood... Where are you taking those, Katerina? - To the window sill, it's Analysis Day. - Analipsis! -Ascension Day- Why put candles? We'll light them at night... ...so that... ..the souls can see... What is this again, mother? Candles and souls... and nonsense... - "Ascension Day" and such... - Why ma? It's a custom. Leave them Katerina. The sun will melt them now. We'll place them after our park walk. Go eat lunch, Katerina. We'll walk in the park together. Long live ma! Long live ma! Praise thee, oh God! How come? Quickly or Lukia dies! You seek us, Vangelis! You seek! Hurry Lukia, you'll die soon! Women talking: Barbarians... Did you read what he did to her? Work and all work... and beating her all day... 300 years backwards... Child: She spilled blood on him! You never know a human's fate... I know, technology and that crap... What's technology to do with it? - She said she got a blur... - ...it's the Middle Ages... What can I say? Her daughter came to the hairdresser's the other day... A real mess she was... While getting her hair done... She cried her heart out... ...but in the lime? The lime? The beast! The beast! Didn't throw a human in! We're civilized people. You may divorce, talk to a lawyer... Not in the lime... - If you were in her shoes... - She could've broken his head... - She had him all "sit and listen"... - Oh, well... Talk about other girls... What's her gain now? A lifetime in prison... She got blurry, saw red... She was right... I'm done! Damn it!... Took me an hour the damn card... - Behave! - The uncle, the uncle! Where is the fox, the bear? Katerina! Where's grandma? Came by yourself today? - Want to see the lion!... - We want to see the beasts. I'll show you where monkey is... Today she...the one in red... came to the park... - This wasn't a park here... - What was it? A graveyard, an old one... All this came later... Then, it was tombstones, crosses all around... What? Down here? Down here's full of ancient ones... ...Byzantine... ...armoured ones... ELAS fighters... Millions of them, millions... Take us to see those. I.... I was passing outside here one day and... I saw this and said "this will be a park some day"... The soil is good! Deeper down there's a burrow... - A burrow. - What is a burrow? A subway tunnel. Goes underneath.... ...the whole city. From there... From there comes also the... - The fairy of mid... - The midday fairy. Then you go tell it to your families... Don't hear that... She may come... - But when? -She may come... - ...Today! - It's a lie! You say that every time! I know she'll come. But she is scared of..... -The beasts! - The beasts. They're all mixed together. Lions, rattlesnakes... serpents, bears... All those, fighting one another. Show us, show us! Why don't you? I keep them all in. Where will the fairy come from? Africa? Africa is in Egypt. Here it is Athens! Now they have softened. Where will the fairy come from? But now... Now it is the plants. They argue and they fight with... with the trees... Why do they fight? They strangle one another cunningly... Nobody notices. From the roots... During the day they stand still like this... they behave... And at nighttime... They're only scared of the garden Principal. Every night he comes in with a saw and swoops down on them... "If you're a dog, eat me if a wolf tear me apart" "and if you are my sweet mother..." "bend down and kiss me". You're always finishing on me. Never anyone else! Let's get him! I won't seek! Vangelis, you'll seek! No, I won't! This one's blocked, boys. We'll go through the other entrance. QUEEN SOFIA'S AVENUE Stop! Valia! A bit closer, Valia! We're almost done. Keep it up. That's good. The Queen is very beautiful. Giorgos, put that a bit more to the middle... Betty! Turn it a little, so that we see the label, there. You pour... That's good... And you give it to her... Hold it in your hands a while... And then? Very good, you just... You take a sip... That's very good. That's excellent, Queen... Have you hurt yourself? How did you fall? No... I didn't fall. I mean... I don't know... Perhaps the dog frightened you? Are you all right? No, I was sitting here and I fell asleep... Looks like it... You are not injured, are you? Can I help you? Come. You give some? - Gimme! - Please, help yourself. When a crowd of people are gathering... ...to witness a... ...miracle... This happens because... it is as if there... radiates... a wave of ... ...willingness... Definitely. I saw it myself... - He stood up and ... - Run the Marathon... Give us a break, it's midday. That's women's storytelling... A man's face is clay-made... Science is merciless. Miracles abolished. If not for night.... - ...we wouldn't know day! - What's he talking about? I'm telling you solid proof... I'm a witness, it was a true miracle! - He stood up and... - Eeeh, this country lives on miracles. And you believe them? There's one every week. So what? Spyros, you made a mistake, come now. Sorry, he made a mistake. Looking for you for hours! I wanted to see the ducks and you left me alone! Mum, I'm talking to you. I want to get them some food. Why speak so loud? You lost your mummy? Stop it, I say. Give me some money! I have no money. I'm not mummy. Excuse me, perhaps you saw... Do you know the child's mother? You are my mummy and you do this to scare me. Come now, child.

She takes them all?... Look! Just look at that mess! This is forbidden zone. You didn't see the sign out front? I don't know. I have something for you... Nothing is lost forever. If you don't believe, come. I'll show you. I kept it all for you. I didn't lose anything. I find everything! The outsiders forget them. All of you! Nothing is lost forever. They would have been stolen. I find all these. Outsiders forget them. Who left this one? This belonged to a foreign wanderer. From too long ago. He was hunting for treasures here. And this? I have this for the winter. Belonged to a lady. Very rich lady. She lived here in the palace. Where is she now? Gone. She's sleeping now. Whose was this? This is the Queen's.

Hello? Did they show up yet? No, I didn't go, mother. I'm about to, now. Please, mother. Don't worry. They must have gone to Aegli Cafe. What did she have to do? But it's already 8.20. Okay, mother.

Lieutenant, we're on Saligaros Hill. My child! My child! My child! Hold him... Let me go! It's our job we're doing, mister, please! We've taken all the children. They're in a wretched state. Something has been done to them. As if they're moonstruck, you cannot imagine... Seen that woman before? She's got a girl and wounded her. She injured a man from the Guard and one from the Fire Department. But there are no more children in there. We got them all, didn't we? I think so. Don't shoot her. Don't shoot her. There's people nearby. Are you sure she got a child? Yes, Commander. Of what age? I'm not sure. Around 25 or 30. Doctor! Where's the doctor? You, get the doctor... What is he? What are you, man? Take him in! A woman in a red blouse and a girl around six... She took her and disappeared, a six-year old girl... The President is asking about the fireworks. Be careful at the exits. - A woman in red and a girl around six. - ...I heard it's her mother... Beware, the child is in danger. Spyropoulou, I.B.S... That's the multinational across the street.

Noone's in there now. Leave us. The park has been evacuated. Tell me what's going on. - Now, take him away... - She's off to the sea now... She went through the burrow... The burrow. Commissioner, Commissioner, Sir! Dimitriadis was found shot! Please, let us in! I need more men and torchlights. It's dark and we can't see anything. Mr. Hartman himself is coming in fifteen minutes, to see the man in charge, since there is some sort of problem. You may use the phone here. Mrs. Spyropoulou is on the first team, for training... She's the first woman ever to... 7-0-1-1-4-3-7. - Shall I call from here, Lieutenant? - No, come down. We'll call. I'm telling you, there's no precedent, no problem, no reason to fear. You're right. I understand absolutely. Mr. Spyropoulos, your wife is in a bad condition. You cannot talk to her. She is dangerous. She cannot listen to you! Yes, she can! You see, next week she's flying to America. She's been tested. The computer... Mr. Spyropoulos, your daughter may be in danger! Please, Mr. Public Prosecutor, don't let them.... Calm down. Wait. Don't let him through! Mr. Public Prosecutor, please don't permit them to... Vlassopoulos, legal adviser of I.B.S. company. This is our superintendent, Mr. Hartman. Police Captain, Fotiadis. Mr. Fotiadis, we'd like to know what this is all about, what's the connection to Mrs. Spyropoulou. It's a horrible thing for the company, too, you see... I'll be frank. I'm afraid she's caused all this. Her husband says there's been no precedent but... Listen, Mr. Fotiadis. There's a very serious issue. The company has chosen her for special training in the States. She's a logic phenomenon, a brilliant mind, so you see... My concern is to get her out of there alive. Both her and the girl. - Were they found? - No, SIr. He'll be in danger if you let him in. She's no human, Commander! Here, Sergeant! - The bear killed him too! - What bear? - All animals are away now. - Are you mad? She hit him. - A mad man is powerful. - She killed her own child, too. To all men of the Parliament Guard. Move back to your Unit. All back to your Unit immediately. Stay close to him! Let him go but stay close!
