Oh, god. - Just keep moving. - Oh, my god. Do you see it? Just keep moving! Oh, god. Shut your mouth. No. Oh, god. Oh, god. Oh, god. I ain't lettin' you slow me down. - Ah! - Quiet, Jeremiah! Oh, you son of a bitch. Unbind--unbind me! Son of a bitch. - Sorry, partner. - Earl! No, fuck! No! No! No, god, please. Earl! Don't leave me, you son of a bitch! Shit! Shit! Ugh! Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Holy shit! Shit! Go! Get out of here! Go away! Leave me alone! Oh, shit! Oh--oh, shit! Aaahh!! He-help! Hey squaw! What the hell you think you're doing in my town, huh? You goddamn savage. Ah! -There. Get your ass up here. Your whole kind is filth! You hear me? Filth! Morning, Sheriff. Agh! -Tommy, I'm getting real sick and tired of your bullshit. All right? This has gotta stop, all right? -Everything all right, Sheriff? -Tommy just bein' a burr in my boot again is all. -Sheriff. -Yeah. Oh, they're just-- a pain in the ass like a mule, aren't they? Just go put the kettle on, would ya? Just give me a minute. What can I do for you now, huh? -Ho--horse. Buy horse. With rags like that, you're gonna buy a horse, huh? I don't think so. -Horse. -Goddammit. Goddamn shithole. -Jesus Christ! What the hell's going on today? At least it's quiet, patron . Nacoma. -You boys best keep them weapons holstered. -Awful nice day, Sheriff. Pudgy prick. -I'm gonna go find the nearest hole. -Nice place you got here. -What'll it be? -Whiskey. -Hey, slick. Come here. What do you call a white man strung up by a group of Indians? -I don't know. -A bartender. -You Pickerton? -Gentlemen, forgive my rudeness, but this game is coming to a close. Hopefully your trip wasn't too cumbersome, Mr. Wilder. -My name is Dutch. Sorry, miss. You have to find another lap to sit on. This is a man's conversation here. I hope I'm speaking to one, 'cause the man I hired went maverick and flopped a simple situation tits up. -You're Pickerton? -Sally Pickerton. This here is Wallace Price, my escort in these lawless lands when business beckons. -Poker? -I don't ride all this way to play no damn cards. -Mr. Price, would you be so kind to get Mr. Wilder and I a drink? -When I hired you, Dutch, you stated that you could perform a quiet and clean robbery. -Well, if someone shoots at me, I shoot back. Where's my money? -Do you have my parcel? -I'm gonna ask you again. Where's my money? -The payment is in order once I know what you have is what I hired you to retrieve. -Seems to be in order. Since you showed me your hand, I'll show you mine. -What the hell is that? -Your payment. A telegram. -Ah. -I'll give the both of you. five seconds to give me my money. -You pull that trigger and hell's fire will rain on you. -Wouldn't be my worst day. One. -Hear us out, Mr. Wilder. -Two. Three. -You like gold, Dutch? -Four. -We know where enough of it is to make you a rich man. -Five. -Next time I see you, I'll take your balls out and eat 'em. -You have no idea what hell awaits you, boy. - Yeah, right. A few months ago, I heard rumors that the wolves out East were planning to hire prospectors to mine deep for gold within Indian Territory. One simply cannot believe in rumors alone, so I did a little sniffing around and with luck, I stumbled across this telegram. Along with it, we intercepted their Indian scout who was hired to escort them through an area called the Black Woods. an uncharted forest somewhere beyond the prairie wasteland, and this is what they found so far. -Those flakes. they ain't worth shit. -If you make sure those prospectors don't make it back East, I'll let you take out as much gold as you can carry. -I ain't no damn miner. By now, those prospectors have probably found enough deposits leading them to a vein. We can sweep on in and take it from them. If not, I'm there to find it. -Sound rosy? -All right, let me get this straight. You want me to kill a couple of miners for you. And then you want me to go dig for my own payment in a place that no one knows how to get to. -Not only did we retrieve that pouch of gold but we, uh, convinced their scout. to give us directions. -You know how to kill people. And I know how to find shiny things. -Is that a fact? -That much gold can set a man for life. Help him disappear. You don't want to be fetching envelopes forever, do you? -Hi, handsome. -Ain't you just a rose in the desert. -Oryen, go see where Edward ran off to. -Oh. -Man. -Buy a girl a drink? -What's your name? -Wendy. -I'll meet you upstairs. -Two Feathers, you got seconds. -You'll find what you're looking for, and once you do, we'll all be rich and free. One more thing: There are many legends about the Black Wood. So, as you travel forth from here, please take caution. Let's hope those stories I've heard are not all true. We must be going. -Miss Pickerton, if you cross me, I'll find you and tie a rope around your neck. I'll drag you behind my horse till there ain't nothing left. You see, I don't care that you're a woman. -Keep in mind, if Mr. Price doesn't return to me within a month, I'll have every lawman hunting you down ready to hang you and your men. You are right, Mr. Wilder. I am a woman. a woman you don't want to fuck with. Happy hunting. Get yourself a bottle of whiskey. It's on me. -Nice chattin' with you. We head out in the morning. Let's go, boys. Lester. What the hell was that all about, Dutch? -Lester, how much money we got? -It's packed in Edward's saddlebag. Why? -All right. We're gonna get supplies in the morning. We're gonna head out. -Where in the hell we going? What about the money? -Lester, just be ready, all right? -Dutch! It's Edward. Ina. -Angeni. Angeni. Angeni. Angeni. Ina. Aha-ha-ha. -Ugh. Hiya. -Seems they stayed warm last night. -He's not too far ahead. -The longer we dawdle, the faster someone else makes a claim. -How many are there? -He's a loner. -Which way did he go?! -Tracks lead north. -No sign of that saddlebag either. -We ain't got time to chase a damn horse thief. -I heard enough out of you. -This ain't about the damn horses. That son of a bitch killed one of my men and took off with my money. You do as I tell. You're in my world now, jackwagon. -Get on your damn horse. Mount up! -Oryen, let's go! -Yeah. Coming! -Wah! Oh! Shit! Ooh! Goddamn horse! I'll string your ass up! Mm, gotcha! There he is. Two Feathers, give me a rifle. -No way you make that shot. -Oh, I'll take that bet. Ah! Winged him. -Nacoma!! Let's go huntin'. Whoo! Whoo-hoo! -Let's go, boys. -First we find my money, and then we dig your gold. Split up! -Get your ass movin', boys! -Ina. -Angeni. We're coming for you, son of a bitch! Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo! Whoo! Where did that son of a bitch go? There he is, right there. Never take my goddamn shot! Great. Looks like we're on foot now. -Goddammit! -Oryen, get off your ass and get up there. I want that bastard back breathing! He's down here! - Merde . Over here. -What you got there, Henri? -Kick me around, huh? -Hey! Did you find him yet? You up there? Two Feathers?! Oryen?! What's going on? -Well, what? Do we wait until the calvary returns? -Lester?! -You wanna know the root of your problems? -No. -This fairy tale of being an outlaw has poisoned your mind and you can't escape it. -You don't know shit about me. -I know all about you. -I know what pains you, too. Guilt. It's colored your senses. What would your wife and child think if they knew what you'd become? - Will you-- -Life's like a wild mare. Always trying to buck us off. Agh! Agh! Egh! -I want to know. how you see your little fairy tale ending. I see my fairytale ending. .without you. -I am the map to your salvation. Yeah. Remember that next time you pull a gun on me. Did we lose him? -Bastard can't be that fast. We should be on top of him. -This one is smart. -What the hell?! We just came from there. -I guess we're going back. Let's go! -Ow! Ow. -How the hell do you read this thing? -Ah! Oh. Oh, god. All right. Shit. -Hello? Come with me, Papa. -Agh! -Ya! I got him! Ah! Shit! Yaaay! - Agh! Wallace! -Wallace?! -Tracks in water. -Great! -Find him yet? Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, ay. -That Edward's? -Yeah. I, uh. Yeah, I found it up there. -Huh? -There ain't nothin' in there, all right? He just--must have burned it all. -Goddammit! -Wallace! Wallace?! -Wallace! -Du--Dutch. -Oh, no. Oh shit. Mother of Christ. Get my horse. -Quiet! Quiet! -Dutch! -What was it? What was it? Tell me what you saw. What'd you see? -The stories are real. -Oh, shit! Shit! Shit! - What the hell. - Wendigo. -It's Dutch! -Agh. -Ah! -Nice shot, Two Feathers. Agh. Ah! -This entire time, we've been chasing and been outrun by a woman. -Don't matter. - This is for Edward, whore. It's okay. I used to be a barber. Get off her. -This bitch murdered Edward, and I say she gets a little trail justice. Goin' soft on featherheads? -I said get off. You're the boss, Boss. Indians taste fucking sour, anyway. No offense, Two Feathers. -Eh. -Is that-- is that Edward's saddlebag? -Yeah. There ain't nothin' in there. She burnt it all. -Damn it! -Where's Wallace? -He's dead. -Dead? -Dead how? -Some animal. -Bear? No. Wolf? -Why don't you and Oryen go find out what's going on with our horses. And keep your eyes open. -What kind of animal? -I don't know! Just go! -Two Feathers, you bring her over here right now. - Ah! -Shit! -That's Wallace's horse. -It's all tore up. What the hell did that? Well, where's Wallace's body? -Sometimes animals. .they drag off their kill. Watch your back. -What's her name? What is your name? -What the hell? Is she mute? What is your name? What is your name? -Name is Dowanhowee. -Where's she from? -Lakota. -From the land. -Could she be more specific, please? Patron! -What are you doing back here with no horses? -We found the tracks. They're not far. An arrowhead. We found this. Looks like a map. -Shit. City boy was holding out. Never trust a man in fancy clothes. -Whatever killed the man in the fancy clothes took his remains as well. Dragged him off. Exactly what the hell did you see out there, Dutch? -Two Feathers, what do you know about this forest? -Elders would tell us stories of the cursed Black Wood. Home to the devil. But those are just stories. -You--you've never been here before? -No. -I bet she has. -What the hell are you talking about? -I just think it's strange that she knew exactly how to get to this forest. It's either a coincidence or she lyin'. Here. Look at that. You see that? What are those little markings there? Look at it! You know this forest? -She can take us there. -So that's it? We just going to let this dirt worshiper live after she killed Edward? -She can help us find the gold. -That's what it's all about to you, huh? Money? -Yeah. -Gold or not, we're not alone. There's something out there. -All right, now look. We have a job to do here, all right? No damn animal is gonna stop us. You got that? So, if you see it, shoot it. Kill it. We're gonna track the horses, find the prospectors, get the gold, and get the hell out of Dodge. Anybody got a problem with that? How about you, Henri? You got a problem with that? Good. You and Two Feathers, go track them horses. Find the tracks. Oryen, tie her up. You're in charge of her now. -What about the arrow in her leg? -Leave it in. For Edward. -All right. Come on. -Horses run this way. Other tracks go that way. -What the hell made those tracks? -We go this way. -You fucking yella bellied son of a bitch. Ah! -No! Lester! -Agh! You gut shot me, Lester. Shit! -It's all about the money, right? -Yeah. Yeah. -No, Dutch. I-I was gonna--I was gonna give it back to you. I swear I was. -Let's move out. -I'm gonna be all right. Henri. Henri! -Your tale's done for, kid. -No, Dutch. No--no. Dutch! Goddammit! How far can these damn horses go? -If you're scared, you run. I usually just shit myself and then shoot whatever scared me. -Two Feathers. what's she saying? -Leg hurts. Good. Let her suffer. -I will not help you, little one. One cannot talk if their tongue is cut out. -Damn Chief, what did you say to her? Two Feathers! Hey, Two Feathers! Make camp. I'm beat. -I know a whore named Wendy. -You--you've never been with anyone named Wendy. -Yeah, I did, Henri. All the Wendys and the Marys. -Ow, ow, ow. -No Janes. -Lester, you shut up. - And one Bess. -Ow, god! Goddammit! Aw! -Thank you. -Whoo! Goddamn! Oh, my god. -Looks like she popped a cork. -Why don't you ask her why she killed Edward? -He stole her horse. -I guess we know where Eddy got his new horse. -She will live. -Wendigo. Shit. Another Wendy, huh? Wendigo. tortured spirit. The old one said he stood twice as tall as any man. with the claws of a cougar, teeth of a wolf, and strength of a bear. Bear. -Stay close to fire, you'll be fine. -Shit. The Wendigo might hear this thing, huh? -Dutch, that's my horse. -How the hell did that get up there? -What the hell kind of animal did this? -No animal. A man. -A man? -How do you know? -Tracks in blood have five toes. Like a man. -How many sets of toes do you see? -One. -Do you think it's one of those prospectors fucking with us? -There's no way one man can carry a 2,000-pound horse and put it on a tree like that. -Shit, I don't know. Probably caught wind of us coming out here. Started killing off our horses so we'd give up looking for them. -Dutch, we need to leave here now. -Shit, Henri, it's just a goddamn bear! We'll trap it, kill it. -No bear in these woods. -All right, just calm down. Everybody calm down. -I'm very fucking calm, but we have a dead horse up in the tree. -Jesus, Henri. If we would of known you'd of been nut-less, we would have left you at the whorehouse. With Wendy! -All right. -You can't even count, okay! -Grow a pair! -Primate. -Fuck you-- -Would you knock it off, now! Now, look, we ain't going anywhere till we find the prospectors and we find the gold. Whoever's doing this seems to be one foot ahead of us. Once it's one foot ahead of us, we one foot behind, everything's gonna be fine. Two Feathers, ask her which way to go. -Through the trees. -All right. Through the trees. Now, let's nut the fuck up! Now since we got one set of tracks, that means we got one against five. -You mean four. -No, I mean five. -What the hell are you doing? -She's in the lead from now on. Tell her, Two Feathers, if she tries to run, I'll shoot her myself. -What the fuck is that? -Bet it's one of the prospectors. -And they tied him up as well. -Poor bastard. -Let's move out. Go on. Go. Go on now. Papa? I miss you. -What's she saying, Two Feathers? -These rocks are known as the Seven Warriors. -What do they mean? -Long ago. eight warriors sought out the devil within these woods to protect their village from enemies. In return, the devil wanted their souls as a trade, but he tricked them. He devoured the strength of the seven warriors and gave it to one, transforming him into a creature, a creature no man could kill. The other seven warriors were turned into stone. Together they created a wall. A wall that separated the spirit world from the rest. -Fairy tales. That way. Keep your wits about you, will ya? -Fuck this. -If you're gonna run, I'll shoot your ass. -You're not shootin' anyone. -Then why don't you go first, Henri? -All right, we'll go. Go on. Go. Two of you like a couple of children. -She said good luck. -I'll let you know when we get to the other side. Go on. Go on now. Go on. -Shit. Hey, come here. Help me. Here. Help me. Pull my hand. I'm stuck. Ah! Ina. Ina. Ina. Nacoma! Nacoma!! -Angeni! Angeni! Ina. -Hey, you okay? It's okay. This is my wife's. Watch. Watch. -It's all right. I know it's gonna sting. It's all right. My wife, she's, uh. she's, uh. I can't imagine what she'd think of me right now. Hey, hey, hey. Sshh. It's okay. You know, maybe we both gonna see our families soon. That'd be happy, wouldn't it? Huh? Fairy tale ending. You're gonna be okay. Ah. -Here you go, Lester. Go on now. -Thanks. -Why do you think they left a prospector-- - Agh! -hung up in the tree like that? -Probably bait for that Wenshigo thing. -Wendigo. -So, then what happened? Did the warrior turn into the Wendigo? -When the warrior returned home, he found his village under attack. -Great. Here we go with the ghost stories again. It's a bear, I tell ya. -Lester, I swear to Christ, I'm going to shoot you. Shut your yap. -It's a bear, I tell ya. -One who does not listen does not learn. -Go on. -He ripped the enemy apart, staining the soil with blood. He ate the bodies, leaving but bones. The warrior tried to return to his family, but they were scared. scared of what he had become. His own people, that he saved, now banished him from his home. never to return. The warrior ate the people of his village out of revenge. They became known as the Lost Tribe. Those who survived escaped to the prairie. never to return. except for one. Her. She wears the marking of the Lost Tribe on her arm. Her blood runs through these woods. -So, after that, what happened to the warrior? -Some believe he continues to roam these woods in search of the devil, and the souls of the seven stone warriors. The curse of the Wendigo is strong. -Go to sleep. If you can. -Jesus, what the fuck was that? -I told you it wasn't a bear. -It'll be back. We end this now. -Ga! Ga! -Hey, hey, hey. Shut up. Shut up. -Where the hell is it? You see anything, Dutch? - Shh. Quiet. -Lester? -You motherfucker! Get here, you son of a bitch! -Son of a fuckin' bitch! -Goddamn cocksucker! -Let's get this motherfucker! -Where are you? -Aghhh! -Hey, asshole! -Whoo-hoo. -Waa--aah! -Dutch! Shit! Whooo! Whoo! Whoo! Aaaahhh! Come with me, you son of a bitch. Aaah! You motherfucker! Aaahhh! -Angeni. Lester. Lester! Lester! Buddy! Lester! Oh, my god. Oh my fuckin'--oh, fuck! - Dutch. -Yeah. You all right, buddy? - Wendy was the best I've ever had. -Say it again, buddy. I didn't hear you. -Wendy was the best I've ever had. - What? -You'll be okay. You'll be all right. Lester? Fuck! -You've pissed me off now. You want Dutch Wilder? I'll give you Dutch Wilder! I'm coming for you, you son of a bitch. I can smell you, you cocksucker. Yeah. -Oh, yeah. Keep singing, bitch. Papa. Come with me, Papa. -You looking for the devil? Because you found us. -Ah! -I will fucking eat you! -Kill that fuckin' thing. Agh! You remind me of my daughter. She wasn't no Indian. But she had your spirit. She had your sass. She had your strength. My little girl always wanted to visit the ocean. She wanted to become a bird so she could fly there any time she wanted. So, I promised her. one day. I'd get us a little place, so we'd be next to it. But then I had to leave my little girl and my beautiful wife for the war. I got a telegram telling me. I got a telegram telling me that they had both been killed by Indians. Set the house on fire while they slept. Burned them alive. "One day. one day I'm gonna find us a little house. and you can go to the ocean anytime you want." That's what I said. I told her that. Oh, goddamn. Life. life is like riding a wild mare. It's always trying to buck you off when you climb up on it. Oh, what's it matter. You don't know what the hell I'm saying anyway. -Dutch. -Thank you. Hey, uh. Happy ending.
