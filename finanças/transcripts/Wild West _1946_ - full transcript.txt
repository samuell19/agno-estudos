( Gunshots ) I tell ya, marshal, something's got to be done. Construction on the railroad has been stopped cold. This wouldn't have happened if we'd have got that telegraph line through. We've got to get it through, or abandon construction on the railroad. I'm stumped. Well, I'm not. I'm gonna have Washington call out the troops. We're going to put a squad of men along every mile of the telegraph right-of-way. You can't. Why not? Because when you bring troops into that area, it's in direct violation of our treaty with chief black fox. What good is a peace treaty if it only favors the Indians? It might be that black fox is blocking the railroad. Everything points in that direction. But no lawman in his right mind would go in there now and investigate. I know one who's willing to tackle it. He'd have to be crazy. Well, Eddie Dean is not crazy, marshal. He's the smartest troubleshooter we've got in the territory. You mean he was-- until he quit to join soapy Jones on his cattle ranch. I don't believe that. Any man that loves law and order like Eddie Dean is not going to quit fighting for it. Now, you go get him. That's a large order, commissioner. Last I heard, he was driving a herd of cattle up the chisolm trail. I don't care where he was, just find him. All right. Men: Hee-yah! Hee-yah! Thanks just the same, mister. Looking for a man in this country is like looking for a needle in a haystack. You better cut around the herd, soapy, and see if there are any strays. All right, Eddie. Howdy, boys. Don't happen to know a fella by the name of Eddie Dean, do ya? Yeah, we passed him up the trail a couple days ago. Thanks. ( Gunshots ) Eddie, rustlers. They just clipped off another hundred heads. This keeps up, we won't have enough cattle to sell when we get to the market. They're headed for the river. We'll round up some of the boys and teach 'em a lesson. They're holed up in that cabin, soapy. We're gonna have to smoke 'em out. Yeah, that's the only way I can get my cattle back. ( Gunshots ) Let 'em have it! That looks like the leader of the gang. You take over, soapy. I'm gonna nab him. The rest of 'em gave up. Good. We'll turn 'em over to the sheriff, and then head your cattle towards dodge city. I'll be out to your ranch first thing in the morning, to look over your cattle, Mr. Williams. I'm sure we can make a deal. I'll be lookin' for ya. Nice bunch of stock you brought in, Eddie. Outside of losing a little weight to some rustlers, they're in prime condition. We're countin' on a good price to pay off my ranch. Well, blow me down the gopher hole-- it's my old boss, the marshal. Hello, marshal. How are ya, Eddie? Howdy, soapy. Hi, marshal. Am I glad to see you two. I never knew two men could be in so many different places at once. What brings you so far from home? I smell something in the woodpile, Eddie, and it ain't no skunk-- smells like a commissioner to me. You're right, soapy-- he wants to see you and Eddie right away. Darn it, marshal, we quit totin' our badges long ago. Didn't we, Eddie? Sure we did, soapy. We're men of peace now, not peace officers. I told the commissioner that, but you know how stubborn he is. He's got a job for you, bigger than anything you ever tackled before. Aw, just like the commissioner, always got something big on his hands. But this is important. It means the success or the failure of the railroad and the telegraph lines through the strip. We're sorry, but you'll have to do without US this time. We ain't interested in the least. You would be if you knew Jim banister -- what about Jim banister? He gave his life trying to get those lines though. Hmm. I wonder if chief black fox knows about it. Ma'am, when stormy day arrives, tell him to meet US at twin forks. I'll do that. That's how it is, gentlemen, it's more than an Indian uprising, it's a combination of both red and white renegades who have infested the country to live off the fat of the land. You mean livin' off of human misery. That's right, soapy, but they don't want civilization, because it brings law and order. But if that line isn't complete to Preston soon, both it and the railroad will have to be abandoned. Come on, soapy. We'll meet stormy at twin forks and head for the strip. * I'm king of the plain * when I ride on the side of a song * * there's a fire that'll burn to inspire all my work * * when I ride on the side of a song * * the trees will hum a tune * and nod a leafy brown * there's joy in every knoll * and with each happy tune * the trees will take a bow * they're proud of what they wrote * * and below every sigh * is my blue silver sky * let them blend with the end of the view * * here or there, high or low * * I don't care where I go * when I ride on the side of a song * captain: Well, there's the western telegraph company. They're right on schedule. You men wait here. Hello, captain, I'm glad to see ya. Howdy, Butler. Well, you're at the end of the line. So I noticed. I've got some men with me I'd like you to meet. Fine. Come on inside. It was a long ride, but we enjoyed it. Butler, I'd like for you to meet your new assistants. Eddie Dean, stormy day, soapy Jones. Hi. Hi. Hi. ( All laughing ) Mr. Butler's the engineer and runs things around here. I'm sure you men will get along all right. I'm off. I'm taking those rangers down to the border. Before you go, can I speak to you a moment alone? Excuse US. What's on your mind? Surely the commissioner isn't serious in sending me those three range riders, when I asked for 20 men to be detached from the army to help me out. The government can't see its way clear to station any troops here at this time. We're far too short of men for that. In an emergency, however, you will have the cooperation and help of the rangers. Well, so long. Anything wrong? Oh no, not at all. Mr. Butler is very happy to have you men with him. That's great. There's something wrong with him. What's that? He looks so unhappy to be so happy. You have your orders, captain Rogers. I do, and they shall be carried out to the letter. So long. Goodbye and good luck. We'll probably need it. After the half-breed got those Indians all riled up, we cut the line in twenty places. That engineer and his gang? Their lives won't be worth a plugged nickel when them redskins get through with 'em. What is it this time? Did you ever hear of Eddie Dean? Sure, I've heard him. He works as a special investigator for the commissioner. He and two of his men have joined the western telegraph company. They're acting as guides. This means more than just helping the telegraph line. If they get in this town, you're sunk. Your record wouldn't stand too much checking, either. Don't forget you're not a real judge, only a self-styled one, tricking payoffs out of people when they think they're buying real protection. I always give you your cut. Anyway, I'm not plannin' to be any better off than you are. Something's got to be done about those law dogs before they get wise to US. You get too excited. This can all be handled the easy way. Our business is too good to be stopped. Here's the camp, and here's our destination. That's quite a haul. I've outlined to you men most of our plans, but there's something else I think you should know. Is there anything else to know? This has to do with the business end. Well, let's have it. There's nothing like a b-b-big dose of anything -- you either get well, or you get s-s-s-sicker. Keep talking, Butler. The company is putting pressure on me. They've informed me that if I haven't got the line across the mountains by fall, they'll cancel the contract and call it a failure. We've got to work fast. With our help, it'll be a cinch. Working under pressure is like a strong wind at your back, it sorta pushes you along. There's a lot in what you say. ( Telegraph clicking ) What's that? A message coming from our last station. It's dead. What did the ticker say? The Indians are on the warpath. Indians on the warpath?! Uh-oh. Wait a minute, soapy. Won't do you any good to run -- never was a paleface could outrun an Indian. This is one time you're gonna find some Indian b-b-b-blood in me. Hey, Butler! Take a look! Soapy: Smoke signals! Chief black fox is calling his tribe together. We can't overtake the rangers in time to help US out. There's one thing we can do, if we can still make it. Get word to Carrie banister? Exactly. Who's Carrie banister? We'll explain when we get back. If we get back. Let's give 'em a run for their money! Hello, Eddie. Hello, Mrs. Banister. Stormy, and good ol' soapy. We hate to break in on you, but it's mighty important. Old friends are always welcome. Mrs. Banister -- stop calling me "Mrs. Banister" -- you know everyone calls me "Carrie". Meet the family. Of course, you know skinny. Hiya, fellas. Did ya come to sign me up for the rangers? Flora bell and Molly were at school before. Come in. I'm afraid this isn't a sociable visit. We've come to ask for your help. What could I possibly do? The Indians are on the warpath, and everyone knows of your influence over them. And we know that when chief black fox goes on a raid, he always misses your ranch. That's true -- they're grateful. They've never forgotten the peace Mr. Banister got for them with the government before he passed away. The chief has named me "zincalaska"-- white godmother of the Indians. Seein' as how you're on speaking terms with the chief, we sorta thought you'd get word to him that we'd like to talk. Maybe we could settle it without bloodshed. It's worth a try. Skinny, ride over to the chief. Tell him I want to see him, that it's safe to come here. All right, mom. If I don't come back, you'll know I've been scalped. The chief won't hurt you. If you're stopped by any of the braves, tell them to take you to him. My grandfather was scalped one time-- hurry! Hurry! Tell your braves to wait here. ( Speaks Indian ) Come in, chief. Don't be alarmed, they're friends of mine. They're here in peace -- they want to know what's troubling you. Why are you making war on the telegraph line? You gave your word you wouldn't make trouble-- why do you break it? Great white father give word paleface not take buffalo. But not keep word, kill more than can eat. Leave meat in sun, get rotten. My people hungry. You're wrong if you think our government is responsible for that. Every white man doesn't represent our government. There are good and bad people among US, just like you have among your people. Lightning wire bring evil spirit... Much trouble to my people. Whoever gave you that idea lied to you. Exactly. This lightning wire, as you call it, brings good. It's like a great messenger -- faster than runners, swifter than ponies. They're right. It means the coming of civilization -- that brings schools and education to your people so they can learn and study and become one of US. My people no want war, unless paleface take more buffalo. Give US some time and we'll stop the killing. Time? My word you have. As you pass the north pasture, be sure and help yourself to a few head of cattle. Hmm. Don't pick all the fat ones. One fat one. Thanks, Carrie, you're a great woman. I can see why you rate with the chief-- cattle cost money. That's nothing. I'm worried about the chief -- I've never seen him so riled up. An empty stomach will make a man do a lot of things he normally wouldn't. It isn't the government killing off the buffalo, but it must be somebody. I wonder who it is? We'll find out. If it were possible for US to set up a relay station, close by, down here someplace... It would be more advantageous all the way around. It would be closer to Preston and supplies. Why don't you use my ranch as your headquarters? There's a great big bunkhouse and an empty barn you can use for your equipment. Well, I don't know -- what do you think, Eddie? We'd have to get Mr. Butler to be in accord. I can start cleaning the barn right away. You're more than welcome. We'll see what we can do about it. We'd better get back to camp. Bye, boys. Let's go get some of the boss's stuff and plant it around their camp. We'll blow it to bits. Now you're talking. ( Explosion ) Man alive, what a blowup! Lucky thing we took your advice and got the equipment out. Somebody's determined to stop US. And not just the Indians. And we'd better find out pronto who it is. No, wait! Let 'em go. Moving the equipment's more important now. Let's get out of here. I'm gonna ride into Preston and have a look around. I still can't figure out why those fellas jumped US. Might run into something interesting. Can I go with you? If you get bill's permission -- he's your boss, you know. Can I? Sure. I think we can hold down the fort. He's been working hard learning how to send messages. Make a fine operator, one of these days. Come on, skinny. Carrie's sure got a fine family. Skinny's a great kid. He takes after his dad -- he was a great man. Did you know him? I'll say -- we served under him. He helped organize the rangers, and just like skinny, he had a way about him. What happened to him? He was found murdered. That's why we sort of look out for his kid. Ever find out who did it? Nope. But we'll never stop trying. And when we do find out, the one who done it sure had better look out. This is where they're set up, all right. ( Loud commotion ) We got some customers for you. What's the charge? Attempted murder. You wait here with the horses. I'm going to find out what's happening. I'll lock 'em up, but you have to arrange a hearing before judge Templeton. We'll do that right away. His office is just down the street. Make yourself at home. What happened? Nothin' much, they were just wreckin' our headquarters. They look strangely familiar -- something like the roughnecks who jumped US in the hills. I recognize 'em. They're just hirelings, we won't learn anything from them. At least I tossed our hat in the ring. You're just askin' for more trouble. There's nothing like starting the show with a trumpet. I-I knew a fella once started the show with a t-t-t-- with a horn, and he b-b-b-blew himself -- hush. Let's get a look at this judge. Your constable told 'em they'd have to see you. Now, take it easy -- they've got nothing on US. Beg your pardon. We're looking for judge Templeton. I am judge Templeton, what can I do for you? Put a hold on the birds I just turned over to the constable, and arrange a trial for 'em as quick as you can. What's the charge? Destroying property and attempted murder. And assault and battery. I'll hear both sides of the case. I have a reputation here for impartiality. Wait a minute, judge. You can do yourself and the community some good if you keep those hombres bedded down in jail. What right have you to tell me what to do? Every right! My pals and me represent the rangers in this territory. I can vouch for those men, judge. They're not bad -- a little rowdy, but nothing more. We're sending to headquarters for the record of every known criminal in this territory for the past five years. Until our investigation is completed, those men stay where they are. Where there's so much stew, there's bound to be a little gravy. What do you suppose he meant by that? We can't let them dig into those records now. There's probably enough information in those files to hang every one of US, once they get on the right track. What'll we do? Unless something is done, everything we've built up is gone. Don't worry, judge. I'm taking no chances this time, I'm stopping them myself. You can be back with the records in a couple of days. A cinch. Lemme go with you, soapy. No, no. But it's my first chance to become a ranger! In the first place, Carrie'd never agree to it. Why not? If the boy wants to go, who am I to stop him? I'm his mother, not his thinker. He's got to be a man someday, and if he thinks he can do it, he's got my permission and my blessing for a good trip and a speedy return. Whoopee! That settles that. I'll get supper started so you can have an early start. Now, there's a bright idea we can all enjoy. Nothing like starting anything on a full stomach. That reminds me of a story. I knew a man once that started out on an empty stomach -- oh, sit down. Save it. Tomorrow's my deadline to have the telegraph line into Preston. There's one chance in a thousand that we'll make it. The chief's very happy to work with you. He's convinced the lightning wire brings good, and not evil. You'll have the pick of his best men to help you. Thanks, Carrie. We should be able to string the telegraph line into town without detection. That fella you sent US to is letting US use one of his back rooms for our headquarters. I knew he would. Good old smitty, he's as anxious as we are to see this town cleaned up, and he'll keep his mouth shut, too. My braves wait in canyon. Is the equipment ready to roll, Butler? Everything's set. We'd better get started. If we get the line into Preston, the rest will be easy. The way you folks have all worked to help me out, my one chance in a thousand just may be a winner. I sure do appreciate it. We're always glad to help. Maybe you'll do US a favor sometime. Let's go. Eddie: Get that one down through the south canyon. Lightning wire bring good. I'm glad you had a change of heart, black fox. Your help is coming in handy. The rangers sure turned out to be a big help. Their idea of concealing the telegraph wire in the trees is a smart one. They're due to come through that pass anytime now, and they're bringing damaging evidence, probably in their saddle bags. If Eddie Dean ever ties any identifications up with US, we're due for a federal investigation. Take good aim, Kansas. Don't let 'em get away. Skinny, you take cover. Give me those saddle bags, quick. What are you gonna do? Your only chance -- I'll draw 'em off while you get through. No, that's too much of a chance to take. It's the only way. There's nothing in here. That's the banister kid! They fooled US. That hombre that was with him got away. Is he gonna be all right? I don't know -- the doctor's done all he can, he says it's up to skinny now, his will to live. He wants to see you. Is it all right if I go in? Hi. Did soapy make it? Yep. That was pretty smart, having him take the records out of the saddlebag and hide 'em in his bedroll. Would you do me a favor? Just name it. Remember that song you wrote for my dad? I sure do. Mind singin' it? Now, wait a minute -- that song's not for you, you're not heading for the same trail your dad went on, you're not going on journey's end, you're gonna get well. Please, sing it. * journey's end * journey's end * the day is done * for one who rode the trail to the end * * journey's end * journey's end * into dawn * he's gone to meet a heavenly friend * * a cloud for his saddle * he's booted and spurred * to ride into pastures * the angels will herd * he's gone * gone home * for the trail won't fail to bend * * at journey's end That stack can be eliminated, every man whose record is there we know is in the pen. So it's narrowed down to these. And those descriptions fit the three guys we got in jail. That oughta make their case pretty easy. We know there are more than three involved in this. Did you recognize any of the fellas that jumped you and skinny? They were too far away. But say, I almost forgot the most important -- wait'll I get back. Look at this. It's Jim banister's gun. You're right, I'd know it anywhere. There was just one other like it, its mate -- he had 'em made special. Where'd you find it? It was dropped by one of the men who shot skinny. Then he must be packin' the other one. And whoever's packing the other one killed Jim banister. How do you figure? He was wearing both guns when he got killed, and they weren't on him when he was found. Soapie: Whoever killed him is in the gang. When we find out who's packing the other gun, we've got our man. He'll probably be at the trial. Butler, you know our plans. Don't worry, I'll take care of my part. If we're gonna hold trial, we better hit the saddle. Should be here about how. Remember what I told you -- stand your ground. Soapy, you go with Butler. We've come for the prisoners. There ain't no prisoners in there, I had orders last night to release them. Whose order? Judge Templeton's. They're getting the bad news now. There they are. This is getting to be like a game of checkers. Let's see what their next move is. We're in a tough spot. Yeah, feels like the lull before the storm. We've got the trap set -- when do we make our move? I've always been good at games -- how about you? Here goes. Ready for the trial, judge? I reviewed the whole case and ordered the prisoners released. Your constable told US. We thought you'd have a mighty fine reason for such action -- what is it? There's no need for a trial, there isn't even sufficient evidence to hold one. Your talk sounds mighty big, Mr. Dawson. I'm wondering if you're as big in this town as you sound. He's at the head of my advisory committee, with the rest of these gentlemen. And as judge, I make the laws and enforce them in this town. You two have have absolutely no jurisdiction here whatsoever. If you're smart, you'll mount up and ride on. They're asking for a showdown. So that's the way they want to play it. I'd hoped we could settle this without a gunfight. We'll have to work fast. It's a cinch those prisoners are only the smallfry, but you're lighting them up sure brought out the big fish. Exactly. We can pick up the smallfry anytime. Finding the mate to banister's gun is the most important thing to US. Let's get over to Butler. Now, maybe he can do US a favor. Butler, this is your chance to help US. Trouble, huh? Yeah, they're askin' for it. I had hopes that through this gun we could nail whoever killed banister before the trouble started, but I guess it'll just have to wait. Eddie: We'd better get word through to bring the rangers in. ( Telegraph clicking ) No answer. Keep at it. We told you to stay out of sight. I know, boss, but we thought you might need US. Everything is working as we had planned. You're complicating things if you don't do as we say. ( Running ) Wait a minute, Dawson, I just learned something mighty important. Out with it. The telegraph line you were so bent on keeping out of here? It not only got in, but it's getting out, too. I just heard them send a message. Where is it? Set up in the back room of the printing shop. Them rangers are operating it. We can't take any chances. Texas, take some men and destroy it. Kansas, get rid of their horses, they mustn't get away. The rest of you, take cover -- shoot any of 'em on sight. Let's go over to the office -- I'm gonna need my gun. ( Clicking ) ( Clicking ) It's gone dead. The lines are down. They're taking our horses! Do you think the message got through to captain Rogers? We have no way of knowing. Carrie: Skinny banister! What are you doing? You know the doctor said you must rest. They're in trouble in Preston, mom. I'm trying to get a message through to captain Rogers. Keep trying, then! Where there's life, there's hope. I knew a girl once who had a fella by the name of hope, but she hoped that he hoped that -- ( glass breaking ) ( All coughing ) Dawson and the judge are responsible for this. If we could get to them, we can force 'em to hold their men off. Cover me -- I'll get to them. I'll get him. ( Gunshots and screams ) We can't hold 'em off forever, we're running out of ammunition. Keep under cover, fire only when you have to. We're getting out of here. Hold it! I'll take that gun, handle first. I'd rather kill you, Dawson, but I'm arresting you for the murder of Jim banister. This is all the evidence I need. ( Gunshot ) Look what I got. Will they come in handy. How'd you do? About as good as you. Run for it! ( Coughing ) I now make you, skinny banister, an honorary member of the rangers. Mom, I finally made it. I knew you would. Well, Carrie, our job is finished. It will be months before we see you again. Oh, no. It's liable to be next Saturday night. Next Saturday n-n-n-n-- you mean tomorrow? Let's get back to h-h-h--- let's hit the trail. * the trees will hum a tune * and nod a leafy brown * there's joy in every knoll * and with each happy tune * the trees will take a bow * they're proud of what they wrote * * and above every sigh * is my blue silver sky * let them blend with the end of the view * * here or there, high or low * * I don't care where I go * when I ride on the side of a song * captioned by captioneering your closed captioning resource
