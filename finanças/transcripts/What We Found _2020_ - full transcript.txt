Darnell, stop, police! Darnell, wait, wait, wait, wait! I just want to talk. Darnell, wait! No, take the stairs, stairs! Go around, block the alley. Wait, man, wait please. This is 120 pursuing the suspect on foot in the alley Copy that, 120. Shit. Hold on, hold on. Hey, hey, kid, look at me, look at me. Listen to me, I'm gonna put pressure on it. Police! You gotta hold on. All right, call an ambulance. All right, you gotta hold on. Where's the shooter? He drove off. You gotta hold on. Stay with me, come on! Come on. Captain. Douglas. The Captain's got a reason... Did you find it? We don't even have casings. They're ghosts. Did you see the shooter? No, I think these murders are over territory. Well, I'd like to talk to him. Did you ever think that maybe he wasn't just hiding from us? I told you to wait. Well, I thought that he was gonna bolt. I told you to wait. I am your captain, Steve, I gave you an order. I'm putting you on patrol. What? I said I'm fucking putting you on patrol until I talk to the Colonel and I figure what the hell to do with you. Captain. Captain! Hey, buddy. I thought you were going to bed. I have another night. Can you do these before school tomorrow? You know there's an app for that, right? I'll show you app, show you app. You'll do 'em? I'll do 'em. Thank you. It's a big day tomorrow. Get some sleep. - Chris! - Yeah? Do you want some shrimp? I don't know. Your parents are still up. You're such a worrier. Team Dork? Team Dork. God I can't believe you didn't tell me your parents were still up. Grant, what the hell? You forgot to unlock the gate. We had to crawl through the bushes. Oh shit, I'm sorry. Team Dork? Is it nice kissing like that? It's okay. Making out with Brandy Torgenson at the pool once this summer does not make you an expert. It was more than once. It looks messy. I think as you get better at it there's less spit. They'll be at it for awhile, we're good. You know when your parents are doing it? Ew. They're dealer came by. That means date night. They get loopy and they do it for hours but lucky for us, I found their stash. Criminal behavior, that's what this is. Okay, let's go. So why is this thing a big deal? It's a total lunar eclipse when the moon's super close to the Earth. Why's it's red? The light hitting the moon is from the sun and the sun's light comes to our atmosphere and our atmosphere refracts it which messes with the color spectrum so it looks red, kinda like the sun at sunset. It's cool, right? It's weird. It's creepy. Back in the day, people thought the blood moon meant the god's were angry. Hell yeah, if I walked out of my castle and I saw that, it be like the world's ending. Of course in your fantasy you have a castle. Yeah but why did they think it meant something? Humans aren't the center of the universe. Well, I mean, some of us are. You really think that a little bit though, don't you? Yeah but you're one of billions of people on one small rock out of billions of rocks. There's a huge universe out there in constant motion. Sometimes things just get in each other's way. All right, Neal deGrasse, what did you read in your big thick nerd book? Everything's random? There's no meaning to anything? What? It wasn't a book. It was a website. And I didn't say it was random. The universe works beautifully. Maybe there's a plan, maybe that's why we're so intelligent. Maybe we're the universe trying to figure itself out. I don't know if it's the weed or you but my brain just melted a little bit. Talk like that at Cold Spring, they're gonna kill you. Not everyone can afford 30 grand a year for Gilman. You know it's not like they gave me a choice, right? I don't want to be away from you guys and who's gonna watch your back with all those big ass seniors? I will. I kick way more ass than you do, anyway. Okay. I don't need anyone to watch my back. It's gonna be different at this school. Really? 'Cause that's what you said at the start of sixth grade and they're still making fun of you. I'm gonna make it different. All right, dude, just be careful. Two kids from there got shot last month? That school is for real. Move it. Does anyone know how many branches there are in the US government? Come on, guys. Remind me you're? Marcus. Marcus. Three. That's right. Can anyone name one of them? Anyone? Yes. Legislative. Legislative, great. Little suck up. And there are two more. I'd like to hear from someone else. Emily. Uh, the president, right? The executive branch, we call it. And can anyone guess the third? Cassie? Uh, um. I should know this. All right, folks, let's write this down. Executive, legislative. Uh, the supreme court. Supreme court, that's right. Three columns, folks. Marcus Jackson. Still a smart kid, huh? I used to babysit Marcus back when you were like, what seven or eight right? Something like that. You know, I'd love to say, oh my god, you've gotten so big but uh. Hey, beautiful. Oh my god. Bryan, Jesus. What's up? This is Marcus. He helped me in class. Like you need any help. She's smarter than I'll ever be. Marcus, this is my boyfriend. Bryan. I know, I've seen you play. So y'all went to Keatonsville Middle? Yeah. We went to Arbudis. Bunch of stoners. Myself included. I'm Carl, this is Ned. He's a senior but he chills with us. Seniors are lame. Yo, we're going to hell house after school. You guys should come by. What's hell house? An old common in the woods. People go there to smoke weed and stuff. It's haunted. She said you're good with computers? He's awesome with computers. Show them the phone thing. Come on, man, what's the phone thing? It's just a little trick. All right, they're like 20 phones nearby with their Bluetooth turned on. You really want to keep your phone private you need to turn that shit in airplane mode. Wait, wait, what? Do it again, do it again. Oh snap, man. You like that? You're gonna love this. Dude, you're so freaky, man. Hey! Hey, who's messing with my phone? Huh? Mr. Howard, did you want to chat with me? Ms. Byprin, everything's fine. That's Clay Howard. Is Grant coming or what? I don't know, he hasn't texted back. Shit this place is creepy. I know, right? Got you. All right, come on, guys. We're up there. Is Ned coming? Man, that joker got detention. Yo, what up, players? So we start hearing this noise. Shut up. And we think it's like the groundskeeper guy who's always chasing people off. So we put the campfire out and then we see it. Right over there. Looked like a woman wearing like a nun's habit or some shit. A soft glow behind. You guys want to talk about a ghost? Talk about Darnell. People are dying around here, for real. Do you know what happened to him? I heard some city guys been coming around telling the small time county dealers to step off and if they don't. I'm cool. What's the matter, man? You don't like that bud? Now see, you gotta try that shit. I sold them that shit. That's my best shit, right, Carl? Yeah. New blood. What's your name? Holly. Holly. And who's your friend, Holly? I'm um, Marcus? You're not sure? Okay we got Holly, we got Um Marcus. I'm Clay. We heard. Heard about me already. Shit, curious little freshman, huh? Can you get your arm off me, please? So what did you hear about me, Holly, hmm? I heard you were an asshole. Shit, honest I like it. So since we're being honest. Why did you go through my phone, Um Marcus? I don't know what you're talking about. Boy, if you're gonna keep lying to me you gotta practice. Get off. What's wrong, huh? She said move your arm. Huh? She said move your arm. Get up. Get up. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut up. You know I have some tricks of my own, too. Press a button, make a noise. Robbie, what was that thing he made the phone do? Tweet tweet, right? Yeah. Yeah, tweet tweet. Now where is that button? Leave him alone. Wrong button. I guess we gotta try another one. Ow, ow. Stop it. Yo, relax, yo. Calm her down. Do it. Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tweet tweet. No, no, no. You didn't sell me there. You didn't sell me. Tweet tweet. What did you do with my phone, Marcus? Nothing, I swear. Bullshit. Clay. You put some kind of software on there, some kind of spy fucker? No, no, no. It's just some stupid trick. Robbie, what was that one he did in my phone? Uh huh. Yeah. Now where's that button? Stop! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Let go of me. Hey, relax. Hey. Let go of me! Quit it, hey relax. Don't you ever touch my phone again. Clay! Hey, Cassie, what's up? What the hell are you doing? Oh, just having some fun. Okay, just having some fun? Are you kidding me? Messing with the kid. Hey. What is it? Tweet tweet. Tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet. Just don't look at it. Give it to me. Come on. Come on. Come on. This is what we need to be doing right now, really? Don't you want to check your phone? Remember how long it took for us to build this? Half of the summer after sixth grade. We were gonna live here. Never go home. Doesn't work that way. I've got to go back to that school tomorrow and they're all gonna know that I'm the kid from the video who got his ass beat and cried his guts out. I thought it would be different at this school. Why don't we stop by the hospital in the morning and just take a look at you. I'm fine, Ma, it was just a fall. You gonna be okay at that school? If it was good enough for him, it's good enough for me, right? You talk to him lately? I was thinking today that if he was around maybe we could afford that school Grant goes to and maybe you'd have him around to talk to sometimes. I'm gonna go wash my hands. Yo, you should pick that up. Bananas are so good. Justin Weingarter, you're always such a douche bag. Hey. I'm so sorry, I had no idea. He said he was just teasing you. I'm gonna kill him. He's not as tough as he says he is, believe me. Hey, wait do you think that he's the one that sent the video around like from his phone? I'll find out what's up. You really think Clay will listen to her? You think there's something going on with them? Mister YouTube. Hey come on, give us some of those tears, Oscar... All right, assholes. Clay, dude, dude. Awesome, how 'bout after school make this baby cry some more, huh? Nah, man, I'm done with that kid. Dude, fun's just getting started, come on. Kid took a beating. He's a little ass dude but him and his friends stood tall. How much of a beating you think you'd take, Justin? Spit out the tater tot. Leave the kids alone. Why aren't you texting me back? 'Cause you were away. 'Cause I was away? I'm playing basketball. Nothing happened! What happened with you and Clay? Nothing happened. Be honest. What do you mean nothing? Why do I keep hearing his name? Okay, okay, fine. Were you with him? - Fine, yes. - What? How could you do that? I'm just terrified to see him again... Cassie. Marcus, hey. I'll just be a sec. Hey, you wanted me to check your work for the test? Oh yeah, thank you so much. I should, I should go. Cassie, are you okay? I saw you and Bryan and are you okay? Whatever you said to Clay it worked. What happened, what did he say to you? Marcus. He just, these kids were picking on me and he told them to back off and they did. Listen, be careful with him, okay? I trusted him and then I found out that I shouldn't. Found things that he was hiding from me. Just watch your back, okay? Cassie. Oh my god. - Get him. - Yeah. Come on! Let's go. Oh my god. Out of the way, out of the way. Get out of the way. Oh my god. Did you see what happened? Yeah, did you see what Cassie did after? Oh, hey. Good morning, hi my girl, hi my girl, yes. Up early. Given you don't need to be at school today. How are those college apps going? Prodigious. That's an SAT word. I'm going out. I think maybe you should stay in, use this unfortunate incident to think about your future. I'm good, thanks. Hey. Hey! I meant what I said last night. You don't get into college you're not gonna live here anymore. So, mister SAT word, what are you gonna do then? I'm gonna be fine. You had your way, I've got mine. I didn't walk the dog. Hey, it's Cassie, leave a message. For what? These fools are 100 grand a day. To sit at a fucking desk all day, pay that shit off in 10 years? That's chump shit, man. We're gonna be making 100 grand, 100 grand next year, you feel me? Nice shooting, tex. So. How come you didn't ask for no re-up? I will when I need it. Is that what you want me to tell Will? You know what he's been to you? Kind and Will aint known for being kind. He gave you muscle, took all this territory for you to push our shit. 'Cause your pretty ass looks right walking up them big county lawns. Is that what happened to Darnell? I'ma forget you said that and you gave you product, good product, for you to sell. Yeah, we are selling it, all right? All of it. Sell more. You asked for this deal, remember? Here's the thing about stepping up. You could say you're gonna, you could think you're gonna. Only part that matters is the doing. You do, we're gonna be all right. You don't. Big man wants to see you later. Yeah, for what? You'll see. Well lookie here, lookie here. Who's bike is this? Okay. Nephew birthday coming. Rough night? What do you want, man? We shouldn't meet in public like this. Cassie's missing. She didn't come home last night. I thought you might know something. Where were you? What do you mean missing? All right, give me your license and your registration in case somebody's looking. Is she in trouble? I just don't know where she is. The captains on it, they brought that boyfriend of hers in for questioning. Oh what and I'm next, Officer? You don't want me in that room, man. They start asking questions, you know where they're gonna go. Is that a threat? Where do they think she is? You don't get to ask the questions... And you don't get to play cop with me. I could snap you like a fucking twig. It's a good thing I'm not a twig. Jesus, you think that I don't have enough problems at the department without you crawling up my ass? You know who I work for, man. All right? You know how this works. You know my man in the city, Will, has a copy of that sealed testimony, knows what really happened between you and that kid a few years back. How the PD covered that shit up, paid off the parents, kept it from going to trial. So if you want to keep that shit out of the papers and keep that shiny little badge, you give me information. That's how it works, that's how it's always worked. I told you that I would give you information about local drug dealers. This shit is not part of our deal. It is now. Tell me what you know. Look at me, I got busted back to a patrol car. They don't even let me in the room anymore. Get back in the room. Oh, okay. Find out everything they know or I'm making the call. This one, you can really see her, her face. This one, it's, that's what she really looks like now. Can you use all three? Sure. Jeanie, that's a good idea. Do I get them back? Of course. Good to see you. - Hey. - Hey. I drove Cassie's parents here. Nobody will tell me anything. What have you heard? Nothing new. Uh, hey. I didn't tell anyone about what happened at the party. Yeah, good don't. Can I get my phone call already? - Sergeant. - Ma'am. They found you. Yeah, I was out on route 40, out of radio range. I need someone to canvas Cassie's neighborhood. Canvas? Any uniform can do that. Yeah, shoe fits. Ma'am, Captain, Katherine. Let me help. I know you don't trust me, all right, but I chose this job to do good, I did, it's just most days job aint about that. Let me help. Colonel's still looking for a place to put you. I don't know how long you'll be here. Well, I'm here now. So if I'm here in this and I'm not out there doing what any first year could do. I'm the best in the room. Even you know that. You can be good police on this one? Yes, that's what I signed up for. I signed up for the pension. When was the last time you saw Cassie? You gotta think about that one? No I... Why? Just answer the question. Yesterday at school. Yesterday got exciting, I hear Clay Howard... He's a dick. We had a disagreement. We're gonna need more than that. Is this about him? Figures. I told you, he's a dick. Answer her question. It was about Cassie. She's your girlfriend, right? She was. Was? Did that dick have something to do with that? That must have pissed you off. When was the last time you saw Cassie, exactly? At school at the fight. You talk to her after that? I texted her, she didn't text back. Where were you last night? Out. Out? Yeah, went out for a drive. All night? Y'all know how much longer this gonna be? I got a game tonight. I think the warriors are gonna have to do without tonight, Bryan. Yeah? We got something. Long night, you get any sleep? Not bad. My husband got that snore strap, so. I didn't know they worked. Yeah. All right, so we got a 2006 Sonata, it's registered to Aaron Williams. Recover anything? Odds and ends. Receipts, non recent, some old workout clothes in the trunk. Prints? Dusting. No prints on the steering wheel. It looks like it's been wiped clean. Intentionally? Why the hell would she come out here? Come on. It's cold. It's like 80 degrees out. I don't have a swimsuit. So? I'm going in. Go ahead, prep school. Holly! Dudes! Baltimore. We are on the scene. Come on, what is it? My god. That's Cassie's car. What if something did happen to her? Why would something of happened to her? A lot has been going on the past few days. Like what? Well, if you actually talked to your friends when you were off from your fancy country club school you'd know, wouldn't you? For now, channel seven signing off. Did you find her? Hey, scooch. I'm fine. You're not. It's okay. It's okay to be not fine, sometimes. You're always fine. I'm not. Sometimes I think I don't even want to do this job anymore. Yeah, you do. I didn't always. I was gonna be a teacher. Then you came along. We didn't want to tell you and we were hoping that you, that you wouldn't remember but when you were little I was getting groceries. I had finished loading the car and I had you in your car seat and your pink bunny blanket wrapped up like a burrito with legs. Just your little face peeking out. I went around to the driver side and I, I got in and I started to put my key in the ignition and a man opened the door. I looked down and he had a knife and he said, "Drive." So, I drove. I looked in the rear view mirror and I had the mirror set up so I that I could, I could see your face and you were just smiling at me. We got to a red light and this man looks out the window just for a second and I see a patrol car on the other side and he hasn't seen it yet and suddenly I take his head and I, I slam it into the dashboard. I've never done anything like that before, ever, and he, he slashed at me with the knife, I put my arms up and he cuts my arm, there's blood everywhere and I unbuckled you faster than I have ever unbuckled you before and I had you in my arms and he grabbed for you and I pulled him away from you so hard. I ran so hard towards that patrol car and there was blood going down the blanket and the officers face went white and I, I turned around and the guy was running, he was running around the car to try and get away and the other officer was there with her gun drawn and that man kneeled in front of her and the other officer came around and he cuffed him and I didn't want to be a teacher anymore. I've been on this job for 17 years and bad things are still happening in this town and I... And I can't stop them. Give me the damn phone! Oh my god, are you serious? You don't want me to come over there and take it from you. It's getting worse. You can stay at my house. I'll talk to my mom, she'll be cool with it. I'll be fine. Marcus, you have to tell someone what you saw. The cops, your mom, somebody. What if Clay finds out? The guys still have my bike. What if she's out there? You can help find her. Just 'cause it's the hard thing doesn't mean it's not the right thing. Team Dork? Team Dork. May I be excused? That is pizza from Scatinos. You had like two bites and there isn't a piece of broccoli on that thing. I'm not hungry. You may be excused when you finish the food you took. May I be excused? You do remember I gave birth to you that time, right? What? You come home from school the first day with cuts on your face, tell me you fell playing soccer and you don't even play soccer. I do sometimes. Then you come home tonight and won't say two words and boy I am trying to let you do your thing your way but if something is wrong, you gotta talk to me. Nothing is wrong. I am not stupid. I finished my food. Why won't you just let me go? Whatever you are dealing with, you don't have to do it on your own. You're just a kid. I may be just a kid but I'm not stupid, either. I didn't say that. I understand shit. Language. I have to understand. If I'm just a kid than how come I take care of myself all the damn time? Oh you take care of yourself? Yeah, 'cause you're never here. Because I am out making the money that puts the food on the table. You grabbing your lunch out of the fridge in the morning is not you taking care of yourself. I'm on my own at that school. I'm the one that has to survive there for four years. Me not you. You do not have to be on your own. I am trying to help you. Maybe I don't want your help. It is my job to help you, I am your mama. Maybe I don't want a mama. You're excused. That thing you said about dad, I think about it for you, too sometimes. Maybe if he was still around you'd... Marcus. I know, I wasn't really supposed to happen when I did and maybe you'd have a better life... Marcus, that is not what this... Don't lie about it with me. Just tell me the truth. I'm not a kid anymore. I'm not stupid. No, you are not stupid. You are so smart, I don't even know where it comes from. But you don't know everything yet. Relationships aren't a solid thing. They get tested, they bend, then you see if they break and if you haven't used too much that is because the raw material was not strong enough. Your daddy, he said a lot of things. But a man is not what he says. He's what he does. Your daddy wasn't ready for doing. Now tell me, what the hell is going on with you? Marcus. Good evening, I am Captain Katherine Hilman with the Baltimore County Police Department's Criminal Investigative Division. Yesterday, at approximately 8:16 PM, Cassandra "Cassie" Williams was reported missing by her mother, Jeanie Williams. Cassie was last seen yesterday about three PM, by her boyfriend, Bryan Santini. Today, a car owned by Aaron Williams, Cassie's father, was discovered in a parking lot off route 40. Holly, answer your damn phone. Searches of the area are being conducted. At this time, Cassie is considered a missing person. We will continue to conduct searches and follow all leads as they come... Clay! We are reconstructing a timeline of Cassie's whereabouts in the 24 hours before she disappeared. Go. If you have any information whatsoever or saw her in the last 24 hours, please contact our tip line, no matter how minute or small it may seem. We will follow up on every lead and tip. Baltimore County Police. Hi, I have information on that missing girl. Go ahead. I threw rocks. Why didn't you say something or text? I did text. Oh. Could you help me, please? Oh shit, sorry. It's okay, mom's on the night shift. You okay? I want to go to Fort Invincible. Do you need help? I got it, got it. There you go. Having fun there? He's pissed. What happened? He was all pissed because he'd been calling me and I'd been ignoring him. He said with everything going on, he don't want me going out at all. It aint safe. And I was like, I can't be locked in here with you two fighting, no way. He flipped out. Threw a lamp at the wall, sent me to my room. I got out of that window as fast as I could. They're so messed up. It's like, I don't even got a family. But you do. You've got me. You know I love you, right? You love me? Yeah. What do you mean? I mean, I mean I love you. I'm gonna go pee. You okay? You'll talk to him but not to me? Well, he's been around. It's been like two days. I miss you guys. Then why didn't you come to hell house? If you had come maybe that wouldn't of happened to Marcus. I didn't know that was gonna happen. You said you would come. I said I might come. I met some kids at school, we were hanging out. It's always about you, you're so selfish. Just 'cause I have other stuff going on in my life? Good stuff. That doesn't mean I'm not still your friend. Well, a friend would have been there. It's fine. Me and Marcus can deal. We have each other. What does that mean? He said he loves me. He loves you? Loves you like how? I've always... What about Brandy Torgenson? Screw Brandy Torgenson. Shit. No, wait, wait, wait. Marcus, wait. Marcus! Marcus? Holly. Sorry about... Goodbye. What are you guys looking at? Get down. Clay, Clay. I heard something, there's something out there. Did you hear that? Hey. Got you guys some hot chocolate. Thought that this might warm you up, there you go. So I heard that you, you guys maybe saw something tonight that you didn't want to see, is that right? Maybe you can tell me about that? Hey. We were able to get ahold of all of your parents and they are on their way. If it's all right with them, can you take us back to where you were? Okay, I have a file on Clay Howard. You said that he had a relationship with Cassie? I don't know, it looked like that. I mean, I said that on the phone yesterday. The phone? I called and said I had seen her the day she disappeared at school. You called here? Yeah. Do you remember who you talked to? Not sure. It was male or female, man or a woman? Male. That's good. Can you please check that out? You guys are doing great. You son of a bitch. You son of a bitch! Holly. No, no. You defend him? Hey, you don't push your mother! That's enough, that's enough. Suns coming up, let's go. After you. We'll be right behind you. Okay? All right, let's go. Here. Thank you. You mad at me? I'm scared. To think you were there, so close to all that and I had no idea. Can't believe she's dead. I can only imagine what they're going through. Looks like a kind of contamination but unfortunately that is exactly what we're looking at right now. Here, lab results from his car. And the, some of the dirt looks brushed over which means someone was trying to cover up their tracks, like literally. Did you find out who took that call? No, there's no record of it. You sure the kid called it in? Why would he lie? Ask around. What you find out about the car? My guess is it's a small SUV... All right, we got something. Come on everybody, let's go. It smell like smoke to you? Go see what you can see. Hello, officers. This is the captain. Okay. You Clay Howard? Cleaning up? It's a shower, yeah. At noon? No school, two days suspension. Burning something in the back there? Just lunch. Look, can I help you? Get dressed. We'll talk at the station. No. Excuse me? I'm sorry but unless you're arresting me for something I suggest you speak to my lawyer. You have a lawyer? I will in an hour. We're just trying to help Cassie. Don't you want to help her? Lady, I know my rights. What's going on here? Just a few questions. Not without his lawyer present you're not. And that's you? Someone from my firm. What's this in reference to? Cassie Williams. That girl who disappeared? Yeah. Can you at least tell me where he was the night before last? That's easy, he was with me. Anyone who could corroborate that? Call the number on the card. Let's go. No, it wasn't a dog. You said the body was wrapped in plastic. What color? Grayish, clearish, like a shower liner. And you said that what, you were about 75 feet away? Those headlights, that was the only source of illumination? Why would anyone bury a dog there? Sometimes people are looking for a pretty place, sometimes they don't want the body in the back yard. The rangers tell me pet graves are not uncommon. Forensics is combing the site. That will take a day or two but right now all we have tied to Cassie is the car, nothing else. She's still categorized as missing. We saw him, he was burying her. He killed her. You can't just let him get away with that. Right now I'm looking for evidence. I go where the evidence takes me. Look, we'll keep an eye on him. I promise, okay? I just got this. Santini's ex girlfriend filed a complaint against him last year for assault. But his parents got a lawyer, so they settled it. You see him doing it? Clay Howard? Maybe there's another option. Yeah, what? Well that steering wheel was wiped clean and the footprints were brushed over. It was really thorough for a high school kid. That call that kid made, what if it wasn't lost? What if it wasn't logged in on purpose? Hmm. Like a cop? Well. What if we're wrong? I know what I saw. It be easier if we didn't see it but we did. Then why did the cops find a dog? Maybe Clay knew we went to the police, so they moved the body but they needed something to put in that hole to explain what we saw. But how did they know we went to the police? I mean, come on. What can we do? I'm told all the time what I can't do, 'cause I'm a kid, 'cause I'm a nerd. I'm told all kinds of reasons. She was always nice to me. Not 'cause she had to be. Everybody at that school liked her just 'cause she wanted to be and she goes missing. We might have seen her go into a hole in the ground and now everyone just wants to wait around and see what happens? What can we do? We can chose to not look away. We can stand up and do something, even if other people aren't. Just 'cause it's the hard thing doesn't mean it's not the right thing. We can do what we can and give this to anyone who tells us what we can't do. Unless the default settings are turned off our phones should keep everywhere we've been for the last month or so. Hidden file in the OS. Clay hasn't changed the settings. It could have where he's been. And where he might have put Cassie. Cop said she was looking for evidence, let's get her some. Can't believe he's just sitting there. He has, he has to look normal. You guys sure you want to do this? What if there are consequences? Fuck the consequences. Good, I hate that guy. You got him? Also known as. Sitting Blue was a chief of the Hunkpapa Lakota tribe part of the seven tribes of the Sioux nation and the reason that we are talking about him today because there was a treaty in 1868 and it was... Is wearing full war regalia, he's completely decked out, even the horse is decked out and what... Put it away, final warning. Fighting amongst themselves and with the US government. No, he's ignoring it. We'll go through listing all of the events that lead up to. So, let me just take a look at what you've got so far. Free period, he's grading. Serial WN 27843. Try pound nine zero zero six. Hey. I'm sorry about the thing with Grant. It's okay. Is it? I mean, do you like him? I don't know, I mean he can be a douche bag. That's for sure. But maybe I do? It's just, you said what you said and I don't really know what it meant. I guess it meant you're my best friend. You're my best friend, too. And I don't want anything to mess with that. Not possible. Mr. Dexter, please come to the library. Mr. Dexter, come to the library, please. You got it? No, I can't find it. It's not in his desk. It's gotta be in there. Just keep looking. Shit. What? He's coming back. Already? Just stay, I'll buy you a few minutes. Just find it. Wait, what are you doing? What's happening? Consequences. Holly, what the hell are you doing? This is bullshit. This school isn't gonna change my life, you make it worse. I hate this school! Just calm down. Holly, calm down. Calm down, stop tearing these down. Holly, just stop. Screw you. Give me those. They beat up my friend and now they do nothing about it. No, Holly... Screw this school. Holly, stop it, calm down. Holly! Stop it. No way. Give those to me. They're mine. I think you better call security. Screw you, too. Security! No, no! Calm down, just calm down. What's going on? What is going on? One of those days. Hey, dude! What the hell? You stole your parents car? It's better than a bike. You get it? Hey, so about that thing with me and Holly. It's fine, we talked about it. Yeah? Oh. Well, I just wanted you to know that it's... Now is not the time. Sure. Is it fine like actually fine or is it... It's encrypted. Well can you cracked it? Well I had hoped he had an older OS or hadn't set it up but it's the latest version and it's encrypted. I just thought if we did something it, if only we could talk to her, just for a minute, she could tell us what happened. I trusted him and then I found out that I shouldn't have. Found things the he was hiding from me. Maybe we can. Dude? She found things. She found things. I know I'd seen that name before. What happened to you? Suspended, people with perfect records are boring. Did you find anything? GPS log gets lost in the woods but he went back into that park, close to where we saw him that night and left out the same entrance an hour later and then he was there right before we were there with the cops. Holy shit. That's not the best part. What's the best part? I saw him earlier this morning on the other side of the park. Wait, isn't now when we call the cops? Clay moved the body, remember? The only people we told were the cops. What if one of them tipped him off, what if that's how he knew and what if they tip him off again? We need hard proof, we need to find her. What if Clay shows up? Don't make me give you the finger. You're going no matter what? What does he mean the finger? I need to stop by my house. My dad's rifle's locked up. You are amazing. Why'd you bring a Porsche? My dad took the Beemer to work. What? Just don't get us pulled over. Hey. You were right. I can be selfish sometimes but I'm here. Okay. Mr. Howard. Almost forgot. I dropped a pin to mark where he was. Should be somewhere over there. Over there. Hey, Cassie. Shit. Marcus! Marcus! Give me the phone. Toss it. Toss it right now! Give me the phone. Don't move. Don't fucking move. Who was that to? Huh? Who, who was it to? Shit. Who else are you here with? It's just me. Bullshit, you drove the Porsche? I hacked your phone. Tells the cops everything they need to know, whether or not I say anything. You have it? It's already on its way to them. I can still tell when you're lying. It was you, right? It was you the other night in the woods? Yeah, I really wish you hadn't seen me. Just gonna kill me, too? I didn't kill her. I loved her. I didn't kill her, man. I saw you burying her. I could never hurt her. She was the most important thing to me. She'd been dating Bryan for forever but, I mean I never felt something like that before. I think she had a sense of what I was into but I... Clay, Will. Will, Clay. I don't think she knew how deep. Or what the people I was involved with were capable of. Hold on, hold on, hold on. The other day she broke into my phone, saw what I was doing. Saw that I thought Will's people were behind the murder going done. Said she couldn't be with someone like that. I told her I was just in it for the money, that I, that I could take care of her if she wanted. She said she didn't love me. Never loved me, said it was over. I told her I'd give it up, I'd go to college. Whatever she wanted, I'd do it. Do you even care about me? I begged her. She told me stay away and that if I came any closer she'd call the cops and tell them what I was doing. Cassie, I can keep you safe! Cassie, I love you. Let go of me. I love you. Let go of me. Let fucking go of me. I never saw her again. What happened to her? She started telling people what she saw in my phone and that she had to go to the cops. Tell them that she knew who was behind the murders. It must have gotten back to Will that she knew and that she was gonna talk. Shut the fuck up! Told you he wasn't ready. They told me to bury her. Told me to clean up my mess and he made it clear what would happen if I didn't, to me, to Robbie, to my crew. Oh shit, oh shit Marcus I told them I was coming here. Marcus, you need to go. Yo, Clay where you at? Shit. Marcus, go. Marcus, my phone. Marcus. Yeah man, she's right over here. Will aint too happy. Too many people talking, now that 5-0's on it. Hell, when you kill someone people notice. Not when you do it right. Why y'all dig her up. We're gonna move her again. Again? Why? We thought somebody maybe saw us leaving the park. Damn, boy. You fucked this up right. Who's Porsche is that? It's Robbie's. Oh. That's your car? Well, you aint say nothing about having to move when you called, said your phone was gone. That some shit on there might be trouble. Yeah, false alarm. You got it, let me see it. Hey, I see you. Hey, hey, hey. We don't want any trouble, man. Aight, just go. We got it under control. Who's over there? No one. He's just a kid, he didn't see anything. He's not gonna be a problem. Well step on out, kid. No, no, no don't move, don't move, don't move. The kid walks. Holy shit. Fuck! Oh shit. No! Head back towards the car. If you get a signal, you call 911. If you get to the car, get out of here. What about you? It aint that bad. Go, get after whosever in them woods. I'll take care of these two. Marcus, please you have to come with us. Just get the cops here. I'll lead them away if I can. They could kill you. Go, go. No, wait. Come on. Shit. Who the hell are you? I gotta go back. We need to make that call and we need to the cops here no matter what just happened. Then go do it. Be careful. Once I have help on the way I am coming back for you. Okay? Okay. I'm gonna ask you one more time, who are you, who you here with? Mom. Hey, hey. You want us to get out of here? We'll get of here. We didn't see anything. Hey, look at me, look at me. I'm a nurse. I can take care of your leg for you then you'll never from us again. Is that what you want, huh? What do you want, tell me. You're his moms. Aint nobody else coming. Hey! You want this? Marcus go, go. Damn it. Oh shit. Yes. Ms. Alex? Fuck. Okay, okay. Marcus, Marcus is back that way. I know, we have to go. Yo! Shit. Oh my god. Go, go. Oh. Let's go, come on, come on. Keep pressure on this. Listen, they're after my boy. How many? Two, I think they killed that girl. The body's over there. Responding at the scene. Two armed suspects, shots fired. Two vics, I'm gonna need an Ambo for one. Copy that, 118, officers en route. Listen to me, keep talking to the dispatch. It's gonna be okay, okay? My boy. I'll find him. You shoot me, this bag floats down river then whoever finds it has that phone. You gonna get hurt, little man. Just give me the phone and I'll let you go. Fuck. Shit. Fuck. Police, drop your weapon. Alright, then. Yo! Aint you that cop, Steve? Yeah. Shit, what you doing, man? What I should have done for Darnell. Jesus, I didn't think it hurt this much. Ambulance is on it's way. I got the police. Yeah, we know. We gotta find Marcus. Come here. Fuck. Oh shit. You there when she died? Shit. Give me the fucking bag. Let go! Marcus! Marcus! Marcus. Marcus! Marcus! Marcus! It's okay, it's okay. Get down! Drop the bag. Get down. I said get down. Ma'am, keep your mask on. Get him... I need you to keep your eyes open and keep, stay with us. Hey, we're gonna find him. Want me to go? Holly! I'm gonna take you home now, okay? No. Clay. Hey, you okay? Today was a hard one. You were good police, today. B-team is coming to take over. Get what rest you can. Back 1000 hours, thank you, goodnight. Thank you. Goodnight. I told you to go home. Yeah, well if he's really badly hurt he doesn't have a lot of time. You really want to help this kid. Well, some of us signed up for this job for more than the pension, right? I didn't sign up for the pension. I talked to Matt Schwartz. Yeah. He said that he was on phones the night the kid called in. He said you took over for him when we went to go pick up his lo mein. It's not much but if I keep digging I'm gonna find more, won't I? You know why you didn't make lieutenant three years ago? I don't know, why do you think I didn't make lieutenant three years ago? It's not 'cause I told the bosses you hit that kid, it's because you put a 15 year old in the hospital for mouthing off to you. He's deaf in his left ear. His jaw will never be the same and that aint being good police, at least it shouldn't be. Some lines, when you cross them, it's gotta count for some things. So, yeah. I filed that report. You're damn right I did. But today, you saved that woman, Steve, and those kids, and even Howard is hanging on in the ICU, so this thing, whatever you're into, it's over. It's over. You were good police today, Steve. I hope wherever you end up you're the cop that you are today. But it can't be in my precinct. You understand? Yeah. Go home, Steve. They're still looking. But nothing yet. It's two in the morning. They had to do surgery. You lost a lot of blood. You need to rest. For now, at least. The number of times I've said that to patients. And I'm always surprised when they don't want to listen. I tried to get Marcus to listen. I tried to make him come with us but he's so stubborn. I'm mad at him. Is that bad? Are you mad at him? You... Won't have kids for awhile but if you do, from day one, you feed them like you're feeding yourself. You worry about their future like it's your own. Feel the pain when they hurt. When they're scared. You get used to taking care of them like they're a part of you. But they're not really. At some point, they prove it to you. They just become their own thing. A part of me is mad, yeah, that he didn't think how it would hurt me if anything happened to him. But he's not really my boy anymore. It happened. He made his decisions and those decisions saved my life and maybe yours. They brought justice for that girl. I wish he hadn't done any of it but I, I'm proud. I am so damn proud. He did more in one day than most people do in a lifetime. He was so brave. Marcus, Marcus! How can I be mad at him for that? Hey, hey Marcus. Hey, you there buddy? Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, it's all right. Let's get you up. You'll be fine. Come on, here, put this on. Hey, Captain! Captain! There's one. They look like fireworks. Shooting stars totally beat a blood moon. I don't know. Blood moons are super rare, so kind of cooler plus the whole end of the world thing. Blood moon doesn't mean there's an apocalypse. So you say. Remember the last time we did this? She's gone but the world just keeps on turning. How is that right? It aint right it just is. So cold. It's like she died and it doesn't even matter. It does matter, to us. Maybe the universe is cold and maybe it doesn't care, it doesn't meant that we can't. I haven't forgotten her and I won't.
