A true story To David From Saint Martin Yes. Here we go. Ta-da! Go on. Go and take a look. Here's the skirt. Look. - What do you think? - So cool! Say, wouldn't it suit me? I think it would. Oh, can I do your make-up? Just a little bit. Eyes closed. - There you go. - Done? One of the gang's first robberies takes place in arms shop Dekaise. They make off with sophisticated firearms. A policeman rushing to the scene, is killed. From 1982 onwards, Belgium is terrorised by the Brabant Killers. The gang becomes notorious for its grocery store robberies. Seven brand-new bulletproof vests were stolen in Temse. They were prototypes, which very few people had knowledge about. A night watchman was killed in the process. The Nijvel Gang got its name from a deadly robbery in Nijvel. They only took some food items, but the human cost was great. In 1985, the gang resurfaces, more deadly than before. They kill three people at a Delhaize store in Eigenbrakel. They get away with only 5,000 euros. Less than half an hour later, five people... Less than half an hour later, five people are killed in Overijse. Another robbery at a Delhaize store. They snatch just under 25,000 euros. Police and Gendarmerie are everywhere... November 9, 1985 Belgium used to be known for its fries. Now, all we have, is shootings. There are more gangsters here than in Marseille. They'll catch them, Carlos. The day before yesterday, a couple of kids found two guns and a balaclava in the park. You know what the Gendarmerie did? They told them off, and that was that. And those items are being investigated as we speak. You think? By whom? They're a bunch of amateurs. And I don't mean those criminals. - All done. - Thanks. It keeps life exciting, Carlos. In the Congo, we had to be on our toes 24/7. I'd rather see those guys up against the wall. If I were the Minister of Justice, I'd bring back the death penalty. Luckily, I'm just a humble mechanic on his way to retirement and not the Minister of Justice. Can I have a piece of candy? Thanks, Albert. David? David? Come on, son. We need to go. Put that bike away. Rebecca? Rebecca? You're not going dressed like that, are you? Yes, I am. - Metje's present for Saint Martin. - Shush, David might hear you. He already knows. He doesn't. Go and change out of that costume. Tsk. Don't be ridiculous. What do I not know? - Where did you get that knife? - Petje's present for Saint Martin. Right, let me do your hair. You do it then. Don't make a mess. Thérèse, we need to go. Which one? Come on. Albert? And? What do you think? - Nice. Really nice. - The left one or the right one? I have no other pairs that match. - Can I drive? - Go on then. Get out of there. The First Lady comes first. How are you? Aren't your eyes beautiful? Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, I was fourteen in 1936 when my father died and I became the bread winner for a family of seven. I did my duty, so unfortunately, my studying days were over. But later on, I met my love, Metje, and that's how it all began. We left for the Congo and started our first business. Unfortunately, we had to get out of there quite unexpectedly and once we got back to Aalst, we started from scratch again. And here we are. 49 years later, in the AARC. And I've had enough, as you can see. That rhymes. But I leave with full confidence. With his ample expertise, Gilbert is the right man to take over the AARC. Congratulations, Mr Director. And the apple of my eye, Thérèse, has been doing an excellent job with the bookkeeping and is taking care of the customers, just like Metje did before her. That's it. Metje and I are going back to the Congo. Are you crazy? We're going to enjoy ourselves, in any case. Where are the drinks? Albert. Albert. - Yes? - Dear Albert. Dear grandfather of my children. Trusty companion of Metje. And the firm but fair boss of this great business. And our good friend. We all learned a lot from you. It won't be easy to follow in your footsteps, but we appreciate your trust. And we'll let you go now, Albert. But first... Chantal? Aalst celebrates Carnival We party every day And rest assured We won't die of thirst Aalst celebrates Carnival We party every day And rest assured We won't die of thirst Ladies and gentlemen! Because we're all so happy you're leaving... I'm sure you are. ...we all pitched in for a present. - No way. - Yes, yes. You can take it yourself. Go for it. Ah, Albert. - How embarrassing. - Ah, yes, embarrassing. Albert. - Here you go. - Open it! Open it! Open it! A month's stay at a seaside hotel. - Let's have a drink. - Cheers. - David! Be careful! - David! - David, come on! Gilbert, do something. - Leave him be. David, concentrate. Good boy. Stay calm. - That was impressive. - Thanks. Yes, very impressive. Chantal, your boobs, are they a size F or G? What do you think? Double G. How about yours? - Double nothing. - Hey! Sweetie, don't worry. You'll have a growth spurt. - What needs to grow? - Go away. Smoking, are you? David and Rebecca? Come! You can go ahead with Metje and Petje. - We're going to Delhaize first. - Hurry up then. - Come on, director. - I want to come. - You come with us. - It's Saint Martin. - Me too. - Go on then. See you later. See you! - What shall I make? - Silly question. Tomato soup with meatballs! Erm, the... Yes. Put it here. See that? It's half past seven and those two surveillance cops have packed up while the store is still open. How do you know they're cops? You can tell, Metje. From a mile away. Goddammit. A robbery at the Aalst Delhaize store. The kids. I'll get them. Come on. Sir? Do you live nearby? Take these kids to safety. Get them out of danger! Go! Get out! What about our kids? - I'm going back. That boy. I've just seen him. What about that boy? In the parking lot. Over there. It's horrific. Excuse me, can I just... My kids are over there. Carlos? Carlos! I need to get to my kids. You're a dad, aren't you? Out of the way. This way! That's Gilbert. Gilbert Van de Steen. Sir, are you okay? Yes. That's my daughter. Oh God. Thérèse. Thérèse Van Den Abiel. How am I going to tell her? I just can't tell her this. And now? Poor darling. Rebecca... Rebecca Van de Steen. That must be David. It's not him. It's not him. He's still in surgery. I'll take you to the ICU waiting room. Sister? Hilde De Moor, investigative reporter. No, no. No press. Hello, my boy. I'm here. David? Mommy and Daddy? Are they here, too? Yes. Mom and Dad are in a different hospital. And Rebecca? She is, too. Go back to sleep now. I saw them. Yes. Of course you did. Dammit. Mr Van Den Abiel? Dr Rumbaut. No, please, don't get up. He has a very nasty gunshot wound. The upper part of his right thigh is gone. Veins and muscles were damaged. He lost an incredible amount of blood. To be fair, it is his jeans that kept his leg together as he was brought in. The main artery is intact. There is some nerve activity. That's good. We've used a steel frame to fixate the remainder of his thigh bone to the piece of hip bone. The head nurse says he's a good doctor. The best. That's what she says. Metje... The pellets went right through his thigh, ricocheted off the floor and went back in again. He lost five centimeters of his leg. It's just... gone. He asked about them. Stay calm. The doctor is nearly done. - Easy. - Don't look, David. - Very brave. Try not to move. - Sister, can I... - No, not you, I want Mom and Dad! - David, no... Take it easy. Come on. David. David, darling. I lied to you, son. Mommy and Daddy are gone. They're gone. They're dead. And Rebecca? She is too. She shouted. What did she shout? He's gone to sleep. She shouted... - Petje. - Yes? I had a blue balloon tied to my wrist. - David? - I was reading a comic book. Let's go, David. - What's this? - It's yummy. - Put your hat on. It's cold outside. - Bye. - I'm pushing the cart. - Hey... - Let him do it. - Push hard, David. Don't shoot! He's my dad! She shouted... Don't shoot. He's my dad. To David From Saint Martin Mr Van Den Abiel... I'm sorry. The front door was open. I am Hilde De Moor. You may not remember me, but I saw you at the hospital. My sincerest condolences. Could I ask you a few questions about the Nijvel Gang? - I don't know anything about that gang. - Nobody seems to know anything. - I don't know anything, madam. - You may know more than you think. You are disturbing me. But... Mr Van Den Abiel, I am not looking for sensationalism. The investigation is being manipulated. It's a joke. Your grandson survived. He's seen it all. My grandson will not be in the papers or on the radio or TV. I'm asking you politely to leave or I will call the police. I'm leaving. Hold on, I have... This is an overview of all the unanswered questions, missed opportunities, all the errors in the case file, up until now. I'll leave it here. Please read it and let me know what you think. Sorry. Was this what you wanted? He... He asked for you. - Are they wearing their clothes? - Yes. Your mom is wearing the white pleated dress with the red buttons. Your dad used to love her in that dress. And Rebecca? The new wave dress? The one you made for her? Yes. In Aalst, lights have been switched off and shops are closed as a sign of mourning. The country is in shock. It feels like war, but we don't know who the enemy is. All grocery stores near a convenient get-away route, are being guarded by paratroopers and Gendarmerie snipers. The Nijvel Gang's terror attacks have forced judicial police to buy new firearms. Riot guns are available in order to fight the gangsters on equal terms. The Gendarmerie will soon have access to new, faster vehicles too. - Take that away. - Darling, I... Take it away. - I was just looking for a place... - I don't want it. - Hello. Come in. - No, no. We just wanted to give you this. Your grandson's belongings. I'll be damned. - Have a good day, sir. - Any more news on the robbers? My wife and I saw everything happen. We heard the first gunshots. We ran onto the balcony, I called the emergency services and I ran downstairs. Did you see the robbers? No, I didn't. Look, sir, it's kind of you to offer help, but that's not our jurisdiction. There was a surveillance van outside. It had been there the whole week. Half an hour before closing time, they suddenly just left. Disappeared. That would astonish me, but we'll look into it. And when I got downstairs, and this is very strange, there were two heavily-armed gendarmes holding machine guns, standing with their backs to what was happening. That unit happened to be in the area. Yes, but they didn't intervene. Look, sir, we'll look into it. Anything else, you can call me anytime. Ask for Sergeant Lootens. - Thank you. - No problem. - Have a nice day, sir. - Good evening. I'll be damned. My goodness. We nearly lost our little boy, too. Look. Look at that. Metje, the Gendarmerie may still need that. I hope I don't wake up. Metje, don't say things like that. We have to move on, for David's sake. We have to give him a new life. Yes. You're right. But there is something you need to know, Albert. I've always been so happy. But... Those days are gone now. I can't be happy anymore, Albert. Sorry. Albert. Thank you, Sister. Hello, son. What happened? - He was here. - Who was? The curly one who shot me. He was standing there, in the doorway. He was just looking at me, with his blue eyes and the pimple next to his nose. I recognized him. I walked out, pushing the shopping cart. What's this? Isn't it a bit early for that? No, it's yummy. Bye. I'm pushing the cart. Don't shoot! He's my dad! David! Run! The till! The money! Don't look. Don't look! Close your eyes. So... That man's scarf dropped and he had a pimple on his nose? No, his scarf dropped and he had a pimple next to his nose. - You're saying that man was here? - He was over there. - Was he alone? - Yes. Where exactly? - Over here? - Yes. - Probably... with the light off. - No, it was on. - I could see his pimple. - It was on. - Over here? - Yes. - Sister, do you have a minute? - Petje, don't go. - We'll be in the hall. - I'm scared. - Don't be. - No, he'll come back. - He won't, David. - He will. He won't come back. No, David. Listen to me. They are very bad people. You're right. They have to be caught and punished. And I'll make sure they will be. But he won't come back. Promise? I promise. I'll be right back. He was in a panic. He was screaming when I walked in. But there was no one there. He's on painkillers, he has nightmares. It's only normal. Yes, but... he's able to describe one of those robbers in great detail. That's not good. That's not good. Call the police. Here. That needs washing up. And... Please go to the store. I'm not going across the road. Then go somewhere else, but I need to eat, Marie-José. Sausages, a chicken breast, I don't care. A piece of meat, with potatoes, cauliflower. That's all I ask. I say... Why are there no cars in the parking lot? - Customers are hesitant, I think. - Right. When is that one due? Tonight. Can't you help out? Or is the paper telling you what to do? - Of course. - Guys, gather around. Gather around, guys! Listen up. The success of our business has always been the result of... hard work, but if you're going to drag your feet, we'll go out of business. We'll go bust! Alright? So it's up to you. Either you put your heads down, take some initiative and work like you should or... well, nothing. Nothing. If you make it work, we'll split the pot. Agreed? And thank you all for coming to the funeral. Chantal, got a second? - Do you know how to turn this thing on? - Yes, it has a button. - I... - Here, this one. I want to take a look at the books. - Our Thérèse put them on there. - Oh my. Right... - Do you know MS-DOS? - MS-DOS? - Yes, that's... Beir! - Yes! Do we type CD or DIR to start the computer? Right. - DIR or CD? - DIR. No... I know you should never type DEL. I want all the bills, invoices and orders. Hello, AARC. Van Den Abiel. Yes, doctor? We need to operate on his leg again. - But the operation was successful. Sure, but the wound is not healing and he has some tissue break-down. Are you talking about an amputation? I can't predict anything at the moment. I can't. - It can't be. It mustn't be. Goddammit! - Mr Van Den Abiel. Mr Van Den Abiel! This sort of behavior won't help anyone. Not us, not you, and certainly not David. - Get a hold of yourself. - Sorry. You can stay with him till he's drifted off to sleep. - Thank you. - The operation may take a while. - Doctor, please save his leg. - We'll try our best. - I'm his grandfather. Hello. - It's alright. - Another operation? - Yes. - No. I don't want it. - You have to. - Stay calm. - There's no other way. - It will be OK. - Stay calm. Gentlemen, when it suits you, would you mind putting to paper what my grandson witnessed? Sir, we're civilian police. That's the Gendarmerie's jurisdiction. Right. Thank you. Good afternoon. - Staff Sergeant Lootens, please. - ID, please. You can wait over there. - He said I could call him anytime. - ID, please, and wait over there. Mr Van Den Abiel? Here you go. Staff Sergeant Lootens isn't in. - How about the highest in rank? - It doesn't work that way. - I have a fine for you, by the way. - A fine? You'll get it in the mail. Your BMW was towed away in Brussels. - I don't own a BMW. - Is your license plate FHV715? This is an invoice from a towing company. Sir, my car is parked outside. It's a Mercedes, not a BMW. That's strange. I'll send a report to Brussels. You'd better draw up a report on what my grandson has to say. That boy stood face to face with one of the Nijvel Gang. Are you familiar with the 'Brabant Killers'? - I'll report it, sir. - And tell them to hurry up. He has one operation after another. Soon, it'll be too late. Mr Van Den Abiel? Walter Bas. My condolences. I asked you to take those two children to safety. I was in plain clothes. I'll come and see you. Let me know when is convenient for you. - Thank you. - No problem. - It's at the Our Lady Hospital. - Alright. I will call you. Albert. I laid out your pyjamas, so you can stay the night. If you stay with David overnight, I'll come in during the day. Listen, Albert, let's agree on something. You do what you think you have to do. I'll make dinner, I'll do the dishes. But leave me out of it. I don't want to hear about it. Not about the Nijvel Gang, not about the robbery, and not about the Gendarmerie. Something else, Metje. We may run out of money if we're not careful. I was at the AARC. It's in a shambles. I have to go back to work. We'll need the money. - We have savings, don't we? - Ah well... What about the funeral costs? The hospital bills? We're not out of here yet. And they didn't have any paperwork. I don't get it either, but... The kid's not insured. No insurance company will take him on now. How about you write a letter to Delhaize? A tiny piece of jeans had remained in the wound. We got it out. And we removed another three lead fragments. We can't reach the other five. Let's hope the bone grows back. That's why his legs are now stabilized in so-called 'plaster cast pants'. He'll have to wear that for a couple of months. Home for sale Don't forget those mattresses in the hallway. - You need permission to sell the house. - I beg your pardon? - You need permission to sell the house. - The family council has approved. That's unofficial. This is a special inheritance case. It may take some time. You are allowed to rent it out for the time being. My dad screamed. He screamed out of... - Out of pain? - Yes, but also out of anger. The man who shot your father, was the same man who shot you? No. The man who shot my dad and Rebecca, wore a mask. It made me think of the Carnival. The man who shot me, was a lot taller. He wore a black curly wig. His scarf fell down and I saw a big pimple next to his nose. - On which side? - Here. And he had blue eyes. I saw light brown hair under his wig. - Don't look. - 'Don't look', he said. How could I not? He pointed a sawed-off shotgun at me. - How do you know it was sawed off? - You can tell. They didn't do a good job. He aimed at my head and hit me in the leg. - How old are you, buddy? - Nine. David, do you recognize any of these people? Maybe. Hold on. Take a good look. Take your time. You were there. Hey there. Hey. Stay with me. Hey. What's your name? What's your name? Where do you live, buddy? Where do you live? Hyacinthenstraat 43. - That's right. - Only nine years old. But he knows what he's talking about. Gentlemen? That man in the picture he wasn't sure about, who... - Is he known by the police? - What do you mean? Do you know him? And his description of that Giant was very detailed, wasn't it? - It must get you somewhere. - The judge will decide on that. Goodbye. Mr Van Den Abiel, I suggest you don't get your hopes up. - Take my advice and get a lawyer. - A lawyer? Yes. They'll help you. Also if you want to obtain information about the investigation. Look, we know very little, and what we do know, we can't tell you. Merry Christmas. - Enjoy. - Enjoy. Go on, David. You could at least pick the meatballs out. - It's yummy. - Metje made your favorite soup. - What is this? - I don't want to eat. I can see that. Can't you just tell us? Anyway, you need to eat. Everyone needs to eat. I don't. I can't eat. Hello. AARC. - Mr Van Den Abiel? - Yes. Did you read your children's autopsy reports? No. I doubt the Gendarmerie is keeping you informed. Who are you? They were finished off. All three were given a shot to the neck. A military execution. Sir, you should report new information to the Gendarmerie. The Gendarmerie... They are the military. We... Yes? Hold on. Don't hang up. - Officer Walter Bas, please. - Hello. Who are you looking for? - Walter Bas. - He doesn't work here anymore. - What? - He's been transferred. - Whereto? - No idea. - Doesn't it say on there? - No, it doesn't. Sorry, I can't help you. - So who does know? - No idea. I really can't help you, sir. - Mr Van Den Abiel. - Ms De Moor. Why here? Ah well... Just because. My... My children were finished off with a shot to the neck. Says who? I don't know. Do you have that from a reliable source? I don't know. Mr Van Den Abiel, you can trust me. If I tell you I don't know, I don't know. Someone called me and said they weren't just shot, they were executed, military-style. And so... I want you to publish that. I need to be sure it's true. I can't just put that out there. I have to check and double-check it. No, wait. Hold on. Unless it comes directly from you. You can claim anything you want, I can't. But why would you do that? I want to rattle their cage. This was put under our door. What are you up to? Get dressed. The doctor will be here any minute. The cast is coming off. Is the Gendarmerie involved? - Did you read it? - I don't want anything to do with it. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you - Hip hip... - Hooray! - Blow your candles! - Blow them. Happy birthday. This is for you. - A wheelchair? - Hey, we worked on it day and night. - It's a racing car. - You bet. - We have something else too. - Here. Your daddy bought this for you when... For Saint Martin. There you go. Go on, let's drink to David. Careful. Coming through. Watch out. Careful, Chantal. Here. Cheers, David. - Cheers. - Bottoms up! Aalst celebrates Carnival We party every day And rest assured We won't die of thirst Gentlemen, want some? You're probably not allowed. Want to try? Forward, backward, left and right. - Oh right, is it that easy? - Yes. - No, no. - Watch out. No, no. Excuse me. Oh dear. - Goodbye, and thank you. - Keep doing your exercises. - Come on, son. - Bye, David. - Bye, Doctor. Thank you. Bye, Sister. - Bye. - Goodbye. - Bye. Right. Come in, monsieur. We're home. This is your room. I emptied out a cabinet for you. For your toys. And your school things. Metje... Congratulations, my dear. Delhaize will pay us back the funeral costs. Major had to disappear One more bad word about the Gendarmerie and the same will happen to you. Forewarned is forearmed. Is something the matter? No. Who is Major Vernaillen? A Gendarmerie major who ran an internal investigation. They attacked him at home, shot right through the front door. - They shot him and his wife... - What happened to his wife? They were badly injured. For God's sake. Look at what you've done now. Now what? Police protection outside the door again? - What if we need to go shopping? - I'll sort it out. - And he has to go to school. - I don't want to. - You'll go, just like everyone else. - Albert. - I'll sort it out, I said. - Right. 300, 299, 298, 297, 296, 295, 294... In Ronquières, firearms are found that were likely used by the Nijvel Gang. Divers also retrieve a till from the Delhaize store in Aalst. Michel Cocu and the other so-called Borains were long considered suspects. They wanted scapegoats to satisfy public opinion. The Borains were picked up and released a total of 17 times. During the trial, investigating judge Schlicker openly develops the hypothesis that the gang is a commando which through its attacks wanted to instigate a coup. In Brussels, a Parliamentary Inquiry Committee is created. One Nijvel Gang trail led to Gladio, a secret stay-behind network sponsored by the CIA and NATO which would organize Europe's resistance in the event of a communist take-over. March 1989 - Are you alright? - A cramp. Go on. Come here. - I can't go to school today. - What did you say? - I can't go to school. - We talked about this, David. - I have PE. - PE is just one hour. News just in, a new witness will be heard by the Nijvel Gang Committee. It concerns Colonel Vernaillen. In 1981, he and his wife survived an attack in his own... Come, son. Finish your sandwich. Van Den Abiel. Yes. Yes, but... What is the interview about? No, not here. No, it's too small. We can do it at my office. The AARC. Yes. Thank you. TV reporters. They want our opinion on the Committee. And what is our opinion? I won't say anything about the Gendarmerie. I promise. Hey, don't I get a kiss? You used to be a lot nicer, Petje. Done. All set for the national news. Listen, Albert. I was thinking. Your neighbor, that used car dealer. Did you know he sells more than motorbikes and cars? - He sells guns, too. - Carlos... That's just a rumor. Albert, it's true. You can have anything done there. You can have serial numbers filed off, used firearms routed out, shotgun barrels sawed off. Hairdressers hear a lot of stories. Apparently, the place is crawling with gun freaks. Yes, people from the far-right, a weapons dealer, a prison warden, even some Gendarmerie officers who were fired for acting like cowboys. And I hear these guys come and do target practice in Aalst. - Target practice? - Yes, it's a military term. And... one of those guys is a customer of mine. - Who? - Or rather... - He came here once. - Come out with it, who? Apparently, well... Lepoudre. Yes, and the afternoon of the attack, he was in the Delhaize. Lepoudre? Apparently. You didn't get that from me. Those guys hung out there. So they must have seen Gilbert and Thérèse at work here. And Lepoudre was here, too. Lepoudre has been in jail for two years, but not for the Nijvel Gang attacks. Two years, you say? So he could've been at the robbery. And if he was here, he must have been around ours, for spare parts and such. Gilbert may even have known him. And that BMW that was towed in Brussels. How did they even get my license plate? And why my license plate? That's the answer. He was at the robbery, in the parking lot. My children recognized him. That's why they had to be finished off. I'm not going to publish this. It has to be investigated first. Investigated? By whom? By the Gendarmerie? No, but not by public opinion either. This would be a bombshell. Why not? I promised my grandson I would catch those criminals and have them locked up. Mr Van Den Abiel, you're not a detective. And the Gang Committee is doing really good work. Give them a chance. Nothing. I don't know anything. All I know, is what I read in the press. Just like everyone else. Or I get a phone call now and again. Or notes under the door. What sort of notes? Sir... I'm not a detective. I'm just a simple mechanic. Hello. Yes, Albert speaking. - Then he hit the boy with his crutch. - With his crutch? Well, David? What happened? - We were walking up the stairs. - Where? Over there. He was copying me and making fun of me. He kicked my crutch away, I fell onto my back. So I jumped up and... well... - Where is that boy now? - In hospital. Tsk, goddammit. Sorry. David, you know you shouldn't do that. Let's go. I assume you have family insurance? Sure. Good job, son. Don't let them push you around. We went to speak to relatives of the victims. This is Albert Van Den Abiel. If you want my opinion on that Inquiry Committee, the answer is: I don't know. I don't know. They haven't asked me anything, or David, or my wife. Even though we witnessed everything from the start. What I do know is that I would like to sell my children's house. That boy costs a ton of money. He's had fifteen operations and will probably need double that. But I'm not allowed to sell it. After the misfortune we've had, you'd think public services would help you out, that they would show some empathy. That they would keep you informed on the investigation into your children's murders. But I don't know anything. Nothing. I only know what I read in the press. Or I get phone calls. Or notes under the door. What sort of notes? Sir, I'm not a detective. I'm just a simple mechanic. I'm going to bed. You should too. Come, David. What do you think of it? Good night. 300, 299, 298, 297... 296, 295... That school is no good for David. I need to write a letter to the Ministry. He could do an apprenticeship, learn a trade. - He wouldn't have to go to school. - And start working at fourteen? - Just like you did. - Look at me now. I'm still working. Besides, do you think they'll employ someone who's only half... Someone who is disabled. Good night. Mr Van Den Abiel? - It's alright. It's OK. - Go to sleep, David. Come in. Sorry for stopping by this late. I was in the neighborhood. I've come to tell you that the people investigating the Aalst robbery, led by investigating judge Troch, are after two former Gendarmerie officers who are suspected of the attempted murder of Colonel Vernaillen. Are they my children's killers? I don't know. - Perhaps. - What about Lepoudre? Troch has put him under suspicion and he takes your story very seriously. Not everyone agrees with him, but I know him. He's a pitbull. - A drink? - No, thank you. What is all this for? I'm sorry. We... When the doorbell rings... I stand here, I lift the shutter... And then... So they think I'm behind the door and... So if they shoot, they miss, because I'm over here. Like Vernaillen. Take heart. The ball's rolling now. - It is. - Thank you. Bye. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Shouldn't you be in school? For god's sake, you can't be on the couch all day. Albert... I don't feel well. - Pardon? - He's not feeling well. Listen, son. I know it's not easy for you, but there are no two ways about it. You need to keep going, be brave, and study. Metje says I don't have to go anymore. Here. Your tea. David, if you want to get somewhere in life, you'll need to use your head. You need a degree. You have to go to school. I can't, Petje. I can't. There's always a way, son. I have to keep going too. So does Metje, and so do you. All three of us have to. Come on. Let's go to school. Put your shoes on. I'll wait for you in the car. This morning, Colonel Vernaillen stated that banker Leon Finné warned him in the early eighties about a far-right conspiracy. Finné had ties to right-wing circles in Brussels and became a victim of the Nijvel Gang himself. Sources say Leon was shot in the neck from close range. International news... - I'm pushing the cart. - Hey... Don't shoot! He's my dad! David! Run! I am calm, sir. But why should I pay tax on a house that's not even mine and vacancy tax while I'm not allowed to sell the house? Goodbye, sir. Bye. Asshole! Sorry, guys. Yes? His nerves and tendons were severed. We were able to repair a lot through microsurgery, but his fine motor skills will be affected. We were alerted by park visitors, so the police wasn't involved. Sorry, Petje. Don't be mad. You don't have to say sorry. Not you. Really, you don't. It's cold! Good job. Here you go. - Petje! Petje! - What's wrong? What is it? That's the man with the pimple who shot me. - That's impossible. - That's him! - That man? - What's the matter? - He says that's the guy who shot him. - It is! Go to the police! - David, the police won't do anything. - You promised they would be punished! - And now you won't go to the police? - Calm down. They never wanted to listen to Petje. He was brushed off so many times. - They laughed at him. - You promised! - David... - David. David! Look at this. This is the man who shot him. David is 100 percent sure. I can't tell the police or the Gendarmerie, so please, Hilde, put that in your paper. I'm no longer a reporter. - Did they fire you? - No, but... I'm going into politics. I can't stand it anymore. What is happening now, is absurd. Freddy Troch, the investigating judge of the Delta cell, has been taken off the case. He was the only one who ever achieved any results. So why? You just said it. He was uncovering ties between a few recurrent suspects and some bigwigs in Brussels politics and beyond. Suddenly, the entire case file, a few truck-loads full by now, is transferred to Charleroi. They can't even read it, because it's all in Flemish. Translating it would take years. - Sounds like a Belgian joke. - A cover-up, more like. They manipulated from higher up. - They? - Yes, they. Who are 'they', Hilde? The Pope, the Mossad, the CIA? State Security, Westland New Post, you tell me. Our Prime Minister, his Majesty the King? Who needs protecting from whom? You want to go into politics? Good luck, I'd say. Change has to come from higher up. And you need to be more careful. You're your own worst enemy. Think of your family. You're putting everyone at risk. People are outraged over Marc Dutroux's horrific acts. He allegedly procured girls for sex parties. Investigators see a link with the so-called Roze Balletten at the end of the 70s, sex parties used to discredit and blackmail powerful individuals. Tens of thousands of people have flocked to Brussels. The White March is an impressive demonstration of solidarity... Never before have so many people gathered in the streets. Never has a march made such an impact. People demonstrated against judicial and political failings. ...that the judiciary should finally defend those who don't have a say. 11 years later November 9, 1996 Mr Van Den Abiel? About that poster... I do this every year. It shouldn't be forgotten. In our general meeting, we decided not to do it anymore. Right. You're the boss. Take it down, and I'll be back tomorrow with the press. Hey there. Anyone seen my reading material? Kiddo, did you take it again? Wow. Is this where you get your inspiration for Carnival? - My tits are nicer. - David? Grandpa's calling you. Goddammit. She's old enough to be your mom. Listen, Chantal and Beir are good guys, but you should keep your distance, son. You'll be their boss soon. - We were only messing around. - Yeah, yeah. I know. I had this new garage built for you, son. This is your future. Take a look at this. We received a complaint. Something to do with soil contamination. What's this? Good morning. What can I do for you? - The Walloon Brabant cell. - We are investigators. They're the detectives from Charleroi. They've started the investigation from scratch. - From scratch? - Yes. Come and listen. David. Tell them we've lost faith. I don't get this. I don't understand what you're doing here. We told you everything a long time ago and no one ever did anything. It will be different this time. The Walloon Brabant cell was created to solve the case. We have authority to investigate everything. We have carte blanche. I don't believe in it anymore. - Petje. - Come here, David. Those files have been gathering dust in Charleroi for years. Suddenly, these cowboys are going to solve everything? - I don't think so. - They've finally come to meet us. I'm expecting an environmental official. Send them back to Wallonia. Sorry. I apologize. He has other... - How could I have known? - The soil report isn't... - Soil report, my ass. - This won't help your business. I have to dig out my infrastructure to clean up some soil. Like that'll help! - This is newly built! - What about your employees' health? If I go bust, they'll be on welfare. Is that better for them? - I'm sorry, sir, the law is the law. - Fuck the law! Where was the law when my kids were executed? Huh? Are you alright? - Hi, Albert. - Carlos. Money and power can buy you anything. Dutroux was procuring underage girls for sex parties. Up to the highest levels. To businessmen, bankers, barons. Even to the Royal Family, it seems. But will any of those bastards ever be arrested? Don't think so. Well, Carlos, at least, those parents know who killed their kids. I have something for you. You may have seen this, but I kept it just in case. Lepoudre confessed he was present at several of the robberies, including the one in Aalst. 'But I'd like to see them prove it,' he says. Can you believe it? ...police and Gendarmerie, among others member of parliament Hilde De Moor. Because of the police war, a lot of precious time was wasted. I believe the political world should draw its conclusions. We owe that to the victims and the bereaved. Not only in the Dutroux case, but also in a lot of other criminal cases Belgium has seen since the early eighties. I am mainly referring to the Nijvel Gang. We now await the statements the Ministers of Justice and Foreign Affairs in parliament. Oh dear. - Where have you been? - Grandpa. 'Where have you been?' At driving school. I want a license, I want to buy a car and get out of here. Did you hear from those guys from Jumet? Yes, they got home safely. I called them. We talked about the pimple guy. The guy with the pimple you didn't want to report. And about your Dupoudre. - Lepoudre. - Lepoudre, Dupoudre. What's in a name. Philibert, Albert. - What was their reaction to Lepoudre? - They'll look into it. And I believe them. They'll be back in the morning. - Back where? - At the office. 9 am. Sorry. Chantal, do you have a minute? I appreciate you're making David feel at home, but you need to be careful, because in his condition... He can't handle all the carousing at night. Carousing? We're trying to solve life's big questions, you know. He was wasted last night. Perhaps, but he wasn't with us yesterday. Don't take it as a criticism. I would just like you to take it easy. - Alright, boss. - Boss? For you. Thanks. - Hello. - Albert? Hilde De Moor. Great news. They're creating another Inquiry Committee. They'll reinvestigate everything. I hope you'll come and testify. Can I ask you something? This Jumet cell? Are they serious? Very serious. They are investigating every trace that has ever been found. It is a shame, but the Dutroux case has put a lot of things in motion, in politics as well. This time, we'll make sure the victims won't be forgotten. Will you come? With David? We'll see. Gentlemen, I apologize for last time. I am his grandfather. Here it is. - A high-level gangster. - If he's the Giant, we have a problem. - He was in jail at the time. - I'll say it again, he was there. - He can't have been. - I was there. I saw him. - You were nine. - I saw him! Take it easy, David. You are right that his jail sentence wasn't up yet, but I believe... he was out on prison leave that weekend. Not everything you read in the press is true. Correct, but this is Belgium, sir. Maybe they forgot to lock his cell door that weekend. Yes. We may think that, but we aren't allowed to say that out loud. - It has happened before. - We'll look into it. - I have to go. - What? Now? - Driving lessons. Goodbye. - Thank you. Thank you. What about Lepoudre? It seems he was hanging out here a lot. He's a hard case. Professional scum. - He's known to manipulate the courts. - And the press and us. What are you planning to do? It's complicated. It's not just Aalst. Each family has their own story. Petje, this is Nathalie. From driving school. Hello. Hello, Mr Albert. Nice to meet you. I've heard a lot of good things about you. Really? I'm sure you have. Nathalie is staying the night. Are you crazy? I didn't bring anything. Don't you worry about that. I have all sorts of things. Ah well... Nightcap? Why not. I'd love to. Thank you. - Did you explain anything to that boy? - No. What's happening? Do you want a driving lesson too? Go on then. Today is an important day for the Inquiry Committee. Victims and the bereaved of the Nijvel Gang robberies will testify... - Why were you in Antwerp? - Antwerp? I haven't been in Antwerp for years. - David, let's go. - You got a fine in the mail from Antwerp. - Must be a mistake. - Try not to get worked up. I crossed the road to run into the store and I saw two gendarmes in uniform with machine guns. But they didn't budge. The reports say it was a unit that happened to be in the area. OK, Mr Chairman, but who were they? Are you sure they were in uniform? - So they were gendarmes. - Anyone could put on that uniform. Did you find it suspicious? - Others did, too. - Ms De Moor? We know gendarme uniforms were stolen at the time, together with firearms and bulletproof vests, from highly-secured barracks and warehouses. All the early witnesses mentioned those two gendarmes in Parklaan. Why? Because people were rushing out in a panic, yelling, trampling over each other, while those two just stood by. Wouldn't you call that suspicious? I brought two kids to safety while... Is that mentioned in your reports, Mr Chairman? Of all the testimonies in Aalst, nothing was ever recorded. I've lost all faith in our justice system, the Gendarmerie and the police. - Why is that? - Because they don't do anything. They don't investigate anything. Trust is something you have to earn. I'll show you something. I drive a Mercedes. I have all my life. This is a fine for a BMW 520, towed away in Brussels with my license number on it. Fake, of course. I went and complained to the Gendarmerie and... this was their response. A fine was arranged in my name. So you see a link between those events? Come on. They wanted to say, 'We know you, we know where you live. Keep your mouth shut.' And today, this was in my mail. A Peugeot. Towed away in Antwerp. Again with my license plate. Wouldn't you call that intimidation? - A coincidence, perhaps? - Would you call this a coincidence too? I am convinced that the detectives never found anything at the time, because they... didn't want to find anything or because they weren't allowed to find anything. Were you kept informed by public prosecutors or investigating judges? - No. Never. - Nothing. It's been twelve years. Twelve years ago, my dad and my little sister were gunned down in front of me. My mother shouted that I should run. And she disappeared from my life for good. We feel like the lepers back in the day in the Congo. Everyone felt very sorry for them, but they all stayed clear of them. And then there's our grandson. His eyes and mouth were taped shut because he was screaming in agony. 31 operations. I still have five lead fragments lodged in my thigh. - Shall I show you, Mr Chairman? - That won't be necessary. I don't mind. I'm used to it. Every three years, I have to prove I am still a victim. That I am still disabled. - Good grief. What do you think? - They listened to us. At long last. - Say, you know what I feel like doing? - No. I want to go to the beach. Yes. I want to see the place where you dumped your first girlfriend. I'm coming then. But first, let's pick up my girlfriend. Deal. Hey! What do you think? She's a good girl. - She's a very good girl. - I think so too. But... not as good as you. I haven't heard that in a while. Inquiry Committee report is out - Sir, could I take a look at your paper? - Sure. You'll have it back. Thank you. - Hilde De Moor. - Albert here. Van Den Abiel. Hello, Albert. - Congratulations, Hilde. Great job. - So you've heard. I'm happy. We've made history. The police force will be reformed. The victims and the bereaved will get protected status. It's a big step forward. What I would like to know is... did you find the killers? Sorry, but that... That wasn't our... - Our assignment. - Did you find them or not? Congratulations on the brilliant career you made on the back of our misery. 25 years later They're here. Metje, Petje, we went to see Saint Martin. What a nice car. - How are you? - Good. - Go and show Petje. - Look, Petje. Isn't that cool? - Soup with... - Meatballs! - Enjoy. - Enjoy. Where are those meatballs? Petje, I got another invitation from Charleroi for the meeting with the victims and the bereaved. Maybe we should go this time? - When is it? - Next Wednesday. I don't know. - You could go. - Alone? With Nathalie. We'll look after Yanni. Right, kiddo? We can't, I'm afraid. I'm exhausted. I'm at the end of my rope, Albert. I don't know how much longer I can keep going. Go and sit down. You can't keep asking them, David. I'm in pain. I'm hurting all over. I want it to stop. Thérèse, Gilbert, Rebecca. They're calling me. What about me? I'm still here. You'll manage, Albert. You always have. If you quit, I'll quit too. Members of the press, please leave the room. Members of the press, I need to ask you to leave the room. You will get a chance to speak to people afterward. Thank you. Tell me, Mr Albert. Short in the neck, not too short on top? - Something like that? - Exactly. - Did you hear about Lepoudre? - Lepoudre? The European Court of Human Rights granted him compensation, because he was wrongfully accused all those years as the main suspect of the Aalst robbery. Can you believe that? How on earth did that happen? Ah well... He's an antique dealer now. Look. He owns a nice shop in Brussels. Calls himself Wijckmans Thibault nowadays. - Well, well... Where exactly? - In De Zavel. Antique dealer Wijckmans Thibault Carlos... - Could you do my nose hairs too? - Sure. - Sure, no problem. - Thanks. Nice work, isn't it? Excellent artist. Mr Wijckmans Thibault. Or should I say Le Manouche, Le Rat, Le Gitan, Mr Propre? Or simply... Lepoudre. Journalist, are you? Listen. I swore I'd never talk about the Nijvel Gang again. Please leave. You will talk about the Nijvel Gang. Delhaize, Saturday night, half past seven. - I wasn't there. - That's not what I read in the papers. Put that revolver down. It could go off. That's the idea. OK, I haven't always been a good man. I once was the most wanted man in Belgium. I committed over 300 robberies, but never with the Nijvel Gang. I'm just like you, Mr Van Den Abiel. I'm an entrepreneur. You know me. You know who I am. Then you must've known my son-in-law, my daughter, my granddaughter. Hm? I spent twenty years reading the papers in jail. Of course I know you. Have you come to avenge your children's deaths? You hold me responsible. So, what are you waiting for? Go ahead. Kill me. Do it. I will. Turn around. Turn around, I said! Is this how you did it? Is this how the Gang finishes people off? Shut up about the Gang. It never existed! People were recruited from all over. That's how it works. Mr Van Den Abiel... Can I ask you a simple question? Who do you think benefited from all this? Hm, Mr Van Den Abiel? They will never find the Gang. It has been 25 years. We are 25 years after the facts. This is the tenth time we the victims and the bereaved have been invited to come and listen... To come and listen to what? To nothing! You always say the same thing. Is the investigation even still ongoing? Did you get any results? Or are you waiting for the case to be time-barred? Why aren't you saying anything? Your silence... Your silence is terrible! And it's an insult to us all! - Sorry for being late. Could I... - Take a seat. Thank you. Any more questions? Yes. I won't ask any questions. It seems you don't answer them anyway. I have something to say to you, madam, and to the authority you represent. The judiciary. It's quite personal, but... I'm not well. And my wife isn't well either. I'm sorry. She's ill. She's in pain. She wants to die. And... I hope she won't mind me saying this in public. - Madam, no recording, please. - I don't mind, Madam Prosecutor. Let them record this. Everyone's allowed to hear what I have to say. Look, I survived three wars. The first one in 1940 against the Germans. Five years of misery. The second one was in 1960, in the Belgian Congo. Our King Baudouin felt insulted by the rather harsh words in the welcoming speech of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba. And our politicians in Belgium decided that should have consequences. With the help of the Belgian military, Patrice Lumumba was arrested, tortured and executed without a trial. We had to run for our lives and we came back with nothing. And we built everything up from scratch again. 25 years later, my third war started. Against the so-called Nijvel Gang. I fought, but I don't know against whom. Were they criminals? Perhaps. Were they gendarmes? Perhaps. Were they National Security? Westland New Post? I don't know. But in 1985, my grandson was seriously injured, and my daughter, my son-in-law, and my granddaughter were shot dead in the parking lot of a grocery store during a robbery. But they weren't robbed. Isn't that strange? Nothing was taken from them. Except for their lives. Their lives were taken. They were gunned down in cold blood and finished off, and it was never investigated, madam. Once again, our politicians did not choose the side of the people who they are deemed to represent. I'm not saying they're responsible or they were the instigators of those horrific acts. Although, having said that... I can't be sure. In any case, they did very little to solve the case. On the contrary. They tried to enhance the mystery surrounding that Gang. They systematically colluded with corrupt magistrates. I apologize, madam. Successive Ministers of Justice abused their power. Detectives were removed from the investigation early, because they were getting results. Imagine that. Others were promoted out of the way for the same reason. Yet others were... bullied to leave. There is even one who out of torment and frustration, took his own life. Plots were orchestrated between criminals and officers right to the top of the Gendarmerie. And as if it wasn't bad enough... a notorious gangster, who was the main suspect for years, was granted compensation by the European Court of Human Rights. Conveniently taking advantage of Belgium's community divide, they transferred the entire case file from one language community to the other, slowing down the investigation for years. It was chaos. You might say that's normal. That's... That's typically Belgian. It's inept, dumb. 'They're going around in circles,' I used to say. But that's not true. It was organized chaos. It was systematic. How come the CCC, the communist terror cell from the same era, who made far fewer victims, was rounded up in less than two years? While the investigation into the Nijvel Gang is still ongoing, I believe. How is that possible? There are people who represent us in official bodies and governments who lay out that strategy, who have the knowledge and hence, the power. They tend to call them 'crocodiles' in politics. That's an excellent choice of word. That's clever. Crocodiles. I saw crocodiles in the Congo. They become very old. They have no natural enemies. They are cunning, strong, quick. And dangerous and ruthless. I ask all 'crocodiles' to put aside their pride, their claim to be right and their judicial truth and tell us, let us know why we had to suffer for all those years. Who and what had to be protected? What weren't and aren't we allowed to know? I'm not asking for my own sake, madam, but for all these people here. And for my grandson, David. Son, you know better than anyone that I am actually a man of few words. In our family, we are sparse with compliments. But times were tough, son. But you should know... You should know that I... love you so much. That I have admired you. When you were a little boy lying in that bed, Sister Benedict by your side. Do you remember I promised you I'd bring the murderers of your mom, your dad and your little sister to justice? Well, son... I apologize. Sorry. I failed. You don't have to say sorry, Petje. Not you. Metje passed away in 2010 Albert died in 2011 through euthanasia David still fights the injustice every day Between 1982 and 1985, 28 people were killed and over 40 injured in 17 Nijvel Gang attacks. Their loot was always minimal. The many victims and bereaved are still quietly hopeful politicians and the judiciary will find the courage. To this day, not a single suspect has been convicted before a court.
