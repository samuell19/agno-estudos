It's okay. Looks like a biggie. Well, Mom, get in that lane, follow 'em down. Will you guys just stop it? Can we get down and watch? No way. Is anybody hurt? Nah, nothing serious, lady. Something just ran across the road. I tell ya, I'm not crazy. It looked like an omelet with two eyes. It must've been some sort of alien. My dad, he's telling the truth...! Think it was a drunk? - It's probably an ADUl. - What? An alien driving under the influence. We need the paramedics here when you get time. - It'll be midnight... - Okay, bring it up, bring it up. It's gonna be backed up for hours. Good evening, miss. Everything all right? - You tell me. - This won't take a minute. All right, you can go. Go on. Next car. Come on, let's pull up. Quickly. Wonder what they were looking for? Omelets... with eyes. Wow! He jumped over two cars! And nobody got hurt? Yeah, right. That car's flat! Jeez! Okay, give it back, Mike. What? - He took my Coke, Mom. - Come on, you guys. I don't have it. I didn't take it. - I knew it! - Gross! - That wasn't me. - Who was it, then? - Mom...? - It wasn't me! I'm onto you! Come on, Mike, give it back. - Mom. - Thanks. Eric, wake up. We're almost there. - Eric. - All right. Hey, look at all the cars. This looks pretty nice. Pretty nice. - Great hill for the wheels, man. - Yeah! No, you're not going down any hills until we've... ...checked it out, okay? I know, Mom. Okay, we're almost here. Close your eyes, guys. Close 'em. Oh, there's a pretty girl. I said close 'em, you cheaters. Come on. You guys are gonna love this place. Okay, you can open 'em. Kitty, kitty. Wow! Top of the hill! Cool, check it out! Two-car garage! Yes, it's the chauffeur's day off! Can we afford this? No, we can't, Eric. That's why I'm forced to sell your brother. - Tough break, Mike. - Hey! That's my stuff you're throwing around there. Relax, lady. It's just our furniture pads. Oh. Sorry. Bring the groceries in, guys, okay? - I like it. - Me too. Hey, how's it going? We're communing with the earth spirits. Right. - Welcome to California, bud. - Really. Here. Aren't you gonna carry anything? Sure. I've got my skateboard. Let's go. Hello, California women. Have no fear, your hormonal hero is here. Oh, my God! - Oh, great house, man. - I can't see anything. Put the stuff over on the table, guys. - You'll love it. - Ceiling looks good. Yeah, well, check it out. This is totally rad! Is this gonna get me a great Mother's Day present, or what? You really scored big, Mom. Look over here. Hey, is that all ours? Yeah, about the first 25 yards of it. You think there's any wild animals out there? Definitely, definitely. - Some big grizzly bears. - Yeah, there's probably some. - Alligators, big nasty ones. - Are you guys kidding? - Maybe a couple of gorillas. - Penguins, penguins. Maybe a werewolf. - Yeah, right. - Hey, Mom, where's my room? It's down the hall. Watch the door. Did you notice, my dear, that there is not one step... ...in the entire place? Low counters. Wide hallways. And you can see out of every window. And, baby, you ain't seen nothing yet! - Okay? - Oh yeah, it's great! Did you see the size of these closets? I'm gonna need more clothes! Yeah, we'll put you on the list. Thanks. What do you think, huh? I thought we'd put the bed right over here. That way you just wake up every morning... ...and see the sun coming over the mountains. You did great, Mom. Thank you. Want some lunch? Ah, no thanks. I'm fine. Ah, your mom said this is your TV. You want me to hook it up for you? No, I can handle it. Just put it down over there. You got it. There's Tooter Shellby on Sea Snail... ...or is it the other way around? Casey Kelp on Clamdancer. Junior Wetworth riding Snorkaway. And Allstar Seaworthy atop Seabiscuit. They're all in line. Here's your T.O.W. My what? Tuna On Wholewheat. Oh. Thanks. Hey, come look at this. ...Allstar Seaworthy, grabbing an early lead... Thattaboy... That's very good. It didn't do that last time. It stayed on. Yeah, well, if it happens again, let me know. And as they approach the home stretch... - Hi. - Hi. - You looking for your friend? - Yeah! He went down the hill. - Did you get a good look at him? - Yeah, he's real cute. What did he look like? He's your friend, and you don't even know... ...what he looks like? I was just kidding. He's my brother. Your brother? Where are you from? Illinois. Welcome to the neighborhood. Looks like you'll be an interesting addition. Hey, Deb, time to eat. Okay. I've got to go. What's your name? - Eric. - I'm Debbie. This is my sister Courtney. - Hi. - Hi. - We'll talk later. - Okay. - See ya. - Bye. Come on. What happened in here? - Did you just go down the hill? - No. Mom is gonna freak out. There's something weird going on. - Look at this. - What? There were footprints here. Somebody was just in my bathroom taking a shower. Yeah, right. You think she's gonna go for that, huh? I'm serious. The TV went on, and it wasn't even plugged in. I'm not joking, Michael. Who broke the lamp? Well, Sherlock Holmes here thinks he saw a ghost. Oh, did the ghost do it? Something was just in my bedroom. It jumped over my head. - Yeah, right. - What thing? I never saw it. It just kept doing things. I'm not lying, Mom. I swear it. Right. I've got something better for the fireplace, anyway. It's Harvey! Eric, you asleep? Uh-uh. Now, come on. I want you to stop worrying about this. Did you lock all the windows? - Yes. - Good. I was thinking maybe it wasn't such a bad thing, anyway. All it did was take a shower and drink a soda. Well, maybe it was one of the neighborhood kids or something. I'm sure there's a rational explanation. Come on, try and get some sleep, huh? It's been a long day. Michael? Oh, my God! Michael, Eric, what have you done? I didn't do it, Mom. Oh, my... Oh, this is my mother's painting! It's a hundred years old! Whoa! What happened in here? Everything's ruined! It's totally ruined! It wasn't me, Mom! It was the little creature! I saw it! The house is totally destroyed! What do you want me to say? I don't want you to say anything! Well, calm down, Mom. This is incredible. It's insane. I don't believe it. Look at this. Oh, my God. I'm going back to bed. What the heck happened, man? Eric! Stop it, Eric, stop! Eric! Oh, my God! Eric! Eric! - Come on. - Eric, swim! Swim to the side, Eric! Swim! Mom! Mom! Swim! Swim, Eric! No! Eric! What is it? Eric! Eric, look at me! Say something! - Did you see him? - What? The little creature! I can't believe he did this. He's all right, Mom. I'll go get him. No, no. Just go and get some help. 2-17, paramedics on the way. I don't know why he did it. I just saw him go. Deep breath? Good. One more. Oh, fine. Now sit back. - How's your head feel? - Fine. No dizziness? I want you to follow this with your eyes. Good. Once more. Fine. You're a lucky young man. Everything seems to be okay. Could you leave us alone for a minute? Your mother tells me that you've been seeing some things. Can you tell me about it? You wouldn't believe it. Try me. It's a little creature. Do you see him often? Just the things that he does. Has anyone else seen this little creature? Just Debbie. She's the girl next door. I'm gonna give you this ah, mild sedative. It'll help you get some rest. Why don't you just ask Debbie? She knows all about it. Here, you take this. And we'll discuss all that later, okay? You get that rest. I'll come back to see you soon. He's not your brother, is he? Why didn't you tell them that you saw him? Because nobody would believe it. What is he, some sort of ghost? I don't know what he is. You should have backed me up. It wouldn't do any good. They only believe what they want to believe. They already think you've got schizo-freakia. Schizo what? Freakia. It's when you see people that really aren't there. Well, I'm gonna prove it to everyone. I'm gonna catch him. Can I come in? Sure. Sorry to hear what happened. You look okay. I'm fine. Mom wants to go, Deb. Okay. I'll see you later. Give me a call. Hey, why don't you invite Eric to Brittany's birthday tomorrow. - You want to come? - Sure. Okay, I'll see you then. Bye. I'm glad you're okay. Bye. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Michael, Eric's brother. I'm Courtney, Deb's sister. - Yeah. - Nice meeting you. Me too. - McDonald's, huh? - Yeah. Why don't you stop by for a Big Mac? Let's go. You never told me about her. I knew I shouldn't have taken this job right now. Mom, it's gonna be fine. - Are you getting a draft? - Uh-uh. I'm rolling up the window. You should be in bed, anyway. - I'm fine. - Michael! Hey, look out, you idiot! I saw it, Mom. I had plenty of room. What is the matter with you today? I'm gonna have to hire somebody to take care of you guys. - I can be on my own, Mom. - That's it. Not if I can help it. Well, Debbie's mom said she could look after him. Okay, we're here. I should have called in sick. You can't call in sick on your first day. - Are you gonna be okay? - Guaranteed. Listen, I'm getting out at nine. Mr. Allen is bringing me home. - Please be there, guys. - We'll be there, Mom. I'm not ready for this. Mom, relax. You've already got the job. - You look great. - Thanks. Never seen her this tense before. Yeah, well, it's her first job in ten years. - You know what I feel like? - A Big Mac? - The man is a genius. - I'm psychic! I tell ya! That's over, though, you know, she's in Indiana... ...I'm here, she's there. Well, you know, that doesn't really matter. So... let's talk about you. Are you dating anyone? Good. What are you doing right now? Oh. What subject? Oh, I'm that's... that's sort of my subject. You know, I can help you if you want some help. Come on over. What are you doing here? - Did you catch him? - Not yet. - I want to help. - What about your mom? I'm not going to tell her. Who's that? It's just my old Chicago Cubs mascot. Here, you can carry the equipment. Put this on. What are we going to do? It's just a precaution. I think you should know I bruise easily. Get those cords! Come on! You still haven't told me what we're going to do. Here, strap this vacuum cleaner on your back. We're gonna suck him up. - What's he doing? - I don't know. You ready? Hit it. Charge! You got him! Don't hurt him! You're hurting him! We got him! Get me off of this thing! Debbie! - Debbie! Debbie! - I'm dizzy. Debbbie! Michael! Hey! What's going on? Get me off of this thing! Turn it off! Stop it! Get this off of me! - Are you okay? - Would you get me off of here? I think I'm gonna throw up. Would somebody please tell me what is happening? He's in the vacuum. What? What are you talking about? It's the thing I've been telling you about-the MAC. The what? The Mysterious Alien Creature. You've got to get him out of there. Plug it back in. Wait, Eric, what are you gonna do? Just do it. I'm gonna reverse the motor. Get me a drink. We hurt him bad, didn't we? It's okay. He looks tired. This is unreal. This is incredible, guys. This must be like what they drink on their own planet. Where'd he come from? I don't know. He came in the van with you. I saw him when you first got here. - Why didn't you tell me? - I thought you knew. Wait a minute. This is what they were looking for... ...back at the accident. That's Mom. - What are we gonna do? - We're gonna tell her. Don't tell her about me, please! My mom will go crazy! Okay, split, Debbie. Go! I'm sorry we set you up. I'll see you later. There must be a power failure. What happened? All our lights are out. It's okay. It's just my mom! Come back! What's going on? Power's surging in the whole neighborhood. - Michael? - Yeah. Is everything okay? Fine, but you'd better come look at something. What's the matter? Where's Eric? - Ah, he's fine. He's over here. - Where is he? What are you doing on the floor? What is all this smoke? He ran off again! It's Eric's friend, Mom... ...the one he's been trying to tell us about. They caught him in the vacuum cleaner. - They? - We. Okay, let's start from the beginning again, shall we? Can I have my chair first, please? Go get him his chair. I sucked him up in the vacuum... ...to prove to everyone that he exists. He's not lying, Mom. I saw it. You sucked this living thing into a vacuum cleaner? Yeah, and then we blew him out again! It's the truth, Mom. No, I can handle it. I can, really. I can handle it. Morning. Strange-looking pets in this neighborhood. Mike! Hey, Mike, wake up. Looks like he came back. - Who? - The little creature. Come on! Ah, cool! Wow! He cleaned up everything! Wow! - You think he did it? - Hey, I sure didn't. Check out the door! Glad we didn't kill the little dude! Yeah, he even fixed Mom's old painting. And look at the ceiling! Hey, we should rent this guy out. We'd be millionaires! Look at this. What is it? I don't know. Looks like he's trying to tell us something. I bet it's got something to do with where he came from. A Wickes Furniture store? And what about these? Maybe he likes horses. This is incredible. I don't believe it. Thanks, you guys. I really appreciate it. We didn't do it, Mom. He came back. Come on. Are you telling me this thing... ...came in and cleaned up the house? Think about it. Would we do something like this? That's a good point. He left these. We think it's some kind of message. It's that thing they were looking for back at the crash site... ...I'm telling you. It's an alien, like the guy said. You still don't believe us, do you? Come on, guys. I believe there's something, but the question is what. Come on, Mom, let's go! - How far do you want to go? - How about to the next driveway? Come on, let's go down to the bottom of the hill and back. Okay. I'm gonna beat you. Wanna make a bet? Good dogs. Good dogs. Stay where you are. Come on. Eric! Eric! I don't think he saw me. What is that? Don't hit him! What is he, crazy or something? What was that? I've never seen anything like it. Tired of feeling all by myself Being so different from everyone else Somehow you knew I needed your help Be my friend forever I never found my star in the night Living my dreams was far from my sight You came along and I saw the light We'll be friends forever I can't face the thought of you leaving So take me along I swear I'll be strong If you take me wherever you go I want to learn the things that you know You know whatever you do I'll follow you Get your shoes on, we gotta go. Anything? Maybe he went to haunt somebody else. That's not even funny, Mom. Sorry. Hello. Yeah, he's ready. Okay. Bye-bye. Eric, that was Debbie. She's on her way. - You ready? - Yeah. Gonna have a good time at the party today? Did you remember to lock the back? - Yeah, I got it. - Water and Power, ma'am. We're looking into last night's blackout. Can we check your power boxes? Sure. They're around the back. Thanks. It'll just take a minute. Mrs. Cruise, did you notice anything unusual last night? Like what? What were you doing when the blackout occurred? - I was driving up the street. - I see. Thank you. Mom, that's the guy from the crash in the desert. Don't you recognize him? Remember? He was the one looking in all the cars. Doesn't it seem a little weird? - Hi. - Hi, Debbie. My Mom wants to leave in five minutes. Okay, fine. Come on, we've got to go. Ah, I'll pick you up at the party later. Listen, don't forget the present I left for you on the table, huh? And call me. I want to know what's going on. So what happened? Where is he? Shhh. Come on. It's here. Get Rankin and the capture group up here. This is 100 X-Ray. Think they followed you here? I don't know. I bet they're looking for him. Maybe that's why he's so scared. - Who is it? - I don't know. What's all this stuff? Straws and flowers. I don't know. And there they go! And it's Allstar Seaworthy... Eric! He doesn't look so good. Get that drink. What's the matter with him? I don't know. Here, you want some? He looks depressed or something. You have a family? Oh, my gosh, there's three of them. - Three? - Ask him where he came from. How am I gonna do that? Wait a second. Your family here? He's pointing to my school. Oh, my gosh, that's my mom! What are we going to do? You'll have to go without me. She won't do that. She's supposed to be looking after you. We can't leave him here like this. You have to go, Eric. Tell her I'll be there in a minute. - What are you going to do? - Just go and tell her. Okay. Bye! I'll see you later! It's not safe here anymore. You have to come with me. Please. I won't let anybody hurt you. What is he doing in there? I think he was changing steering wheels... ...on his wheelchair. Debbie, wheelchairs don't have a steering wheel. Maybe it was a flat tire. Maybe I'd better go help him. I'll do it. Oh, no! Kinda old for a teddy, isn't he? He's from Illinois. Sorry it took so long. That's okay. So, how do we do this? My wheelchair can fit in back, and I'll sit in front. Sounds good. Here, take him. Go. All right, here we go. Sit down. Are you crazy? There's no way you're gonna get away with this. I had to do something with him. Keep him quiet. Sit still. Okay. Everybody fasten your seat belts. Let's go. - Well, what do you think? - Follow them. This is J-3. We're traveling east on Valley Vista. Tell them to stand by. Don't. So, Eric, how long have you two been together? She means the teddy, Eric. Oh, a long time. - Keep still. - Does your bear move? Oh, yeah. Uh, he's one of those new computerized kind. But I thought you said you had him a long time. I have. He just got new microchips. Amazing. What's in here? Hi, Brittany! Happy birthday! Thank you. This is my friend Eric. - Hi, Eric. - Hi. He's cute. Hiya. How's it going? - It's going. - Nice teddy bear. Hi, Eric, how ya feeling? Have you seen my brother yet? Uh, he'll be here soon. - No, Mac, give me that. - Did you see that? - There's something in there. - I don't believe it! Freaky! Look it, honey, we're leaving, okay? I'm gonna go, and I'll leave Courtney here to watch you... ...until Michael gets here, okay? Boy, that teddy is amazing! I'll see you. Bye-bye. Happy birthday! Okay, kids, let's get this dance contest going! - He's here! - What? - Mac! He's in the teddy suit. - He is? I don't believe this! - Let's dance! - Debbie, what's going on? It's okay. Everybody thinks he's just a toy! Hi, Michael. The thing I was telling you about it's in the teddy suit. Oh, no way! He's so cute! Yeah, real cute. Listen, those guys... ...who were following us, they're here. Well, what are we gonna do? I don't know. Just keep him dancing... ...they'll just think he's a teddy. Concrete is jumping in the city Okay, pick up the pace, That's very good, Kathy, They only lie to impress you And wait around for your defeat It's so hard to find someone Who really cares Gives you all that you need In the end is always there To give their heart right from the start You know you can't get burned staying down to earth When the pressure feels like more than you can take Love won't hurt living down to earth If you let it Open your heart and it won't break Down to earth - What's he doing? - I don't know.

Clothes don't matter baby, looks can fade away What's inside that makes the man Leave him alone! He's not hurting anyone!

Stay with him. Michael! Eric! Come on, we've got you! - Now! - You got him! All right! Hey, those are my kids in there! Those kids? Those kids just ran off with a... A little creature from outer space? No, Wickes. Well, no, Palmdale's fine. I just need... That's fine, thank you. No, the address. Wait, give me that again. Why don't you give it to him? Here, Mac. I don't think he's feeling too good. Something's happened to his family. He keeps on pointing in the same direction. There's a Wickes in Palmdale. It's about 20 miles from the crash. - We have to go there. - What do you think? I think we should call your mom. Look, she's not gonna understand. She's just gonna tell us to turn him in. Maybe that's what we should do. No, we have to help him. What if they have a good reason for wanting him, Eric? What if he's dangerous? What if he's got a disease or something? He doesn't have any diseases. I know no one's interested what I have to say... ...but I think he's communicating with someone. It's his family. Don't you like him? Of course I do. I just don't want anyone to get hurt. Look, we're gonna get caught sooner or later. I don't see what we've got to lose. We're gonna go. Come on. Let's do it. All right! Let's go, come on! All right! Thank you, my dear. Ooh, he likes this. Here, see if he likes this. Maybe they're just flowers. - How about a spaceship? - Great! Yeah, and we'll have a close encounter of the third kind. What's that? That's when you get to go on the ship. Here's another police car. Keep him down. We're fine. Hey, he's pointing at something. It's the horses. We've been passing horses all the way here. Hey, did you see that? What? That's it! It's a sign, not a store. Looks like he wants to go down there. Maybe he's picking up some sort of signal. Hold on. Maybe he lives around here. I've got an ocean of love for you You and I are just a wave Love is in motion, wave 'Cause I got an ocean of love for you Waves of motion Waves of motion Hey, look! Windmills! That's what he was trying to tell us. It's the straws! That's it! We must be getting closer! Bummer. I thought it was gonna be a spaceship. You never know. There still could be one. What's he doing? He's communicating. That's it. Let's go. You sure this is it, Mac? You guys better just wait here. Better give him the flashlight. Let's go, Mac. Come on, on my back. Be careful. I know everybody's trying to be optimistic, but what if they really are dangerous? - They're not dangerous. - Michael! Are you sure it's okay? Yeah, just wait there. Get off, Mac. Come on. She's alive, Mac. We're gonna get some help. Just stay here. She's alive. Give me some drinks, and the jackets. - What is it? - There's three more of them. - Three? - Are they friendly? Well, we'll find out soon enough. - There's only two cans left. - That's fine, let's go. Come on, Eric. Be careful. It's slippery there, guys. Hey, Mac. Give me a straw. That's it. See, Mac? She's gonna be okay, Mac. It's okay. All right, see if you can get the other one to drink... ...the little one. Here. Good. Here, put, the jacket, put the jacket on her. Okay. It's okay.

I live next door. This is my friend Eric. Hi. Here, give me the other jacket. Okay, just a minute. All right, put the jacket on. Give me that one, too, Debbie. Hey, hey, hey! Hey, come on! Guys, give me another drink! We don't have any more. - Oh, shoot! - We better get something soon! We're Mac's friends. He brought us to meet you. No, friends, What if they need some kind of medical attention or something? Look, we can't just walk into a hospital. Everyone's gonna freak out. Well, it's just like you said, people are gonna... ...find out sooner or later. Oh, my gosh... What's he doing now? He just tied a knot in the tire iron! It's okay, I think he's just bored! Well, keep him busy! Guys, keep him busy! - Here! Here, read him this! - It's okay. He's got the hat. Look, maybe we should go public. If we can get 'em on the news everyone... ...is gonna want to help 'em. I'm not so sure about that. I think they'll be a big hit on TV. - What's he doing now? - I think he wants my bracelet. - Well, then, give it to him! - You're hurting me! - Michael! - Well, do something! - What? - I'm driving.
