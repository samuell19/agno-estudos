Love is such a feeling.. Wonderful feeling. Well, you do it all the time! Scattered socks all over the apartment spend half a day at the stove, washing dishes. Love is then, such a feeling, it ... in general, somehow You and I will drive from here in different cars. No, one can hardly dream of such a thing. Well, I just never had it. I really want a family. My dad says I should marry a rich, successful... You are rich? Successful. My friend had a girlfriend he loved her very much there was a case and he had to stand up for her honor. They were four to one. What was I to do? Leave a friend alone? Love ... Something, apparently, orange, thin and speckled. I had to fight. But love is an intimate thing. At least that's what my parents told me. I believe them. I don’t know, maybe it happens ... I just fell in love with him at first, and then I saw. Here is such a story. Well, yes, of course, I love it too much. Well, somehow I can not say Love. True love, I guess. only in movies or films. Faster. Stand. If I see you again, I'll tear off the eggs! Thank you. Go. Where? Where were the tickets? What kind of tickets? in Batumi. I can't do that. Can we stay? Les, with whom? With your father? Do you love me? Love very much. Go. Well, actually we agreed with him. No, no, no, it's mine. Quiet, lie down and don't move, okay? I think you have a small dislocation. I'll pull my hand and everything will pass. I'm light, okay? Who are you? I am a doctor. Exhale. Curious news came to us from Georgia. A son was born to a 97-year-old highlander. The eldest son came to congratulate his father. celebrating its 77th birthday the day before. The happy father said that he was not going to stop there. And still dreams of a daughter. It's a pity, they are so cute, but call each other. You get yourself your man and do not envy. Correct the text please. Longevity along with the preservation of reproductive functions, often among men from the Caucasus. Scientists have not yet been able to decipher the so-called love gene. But the local women say the only way to avoid conception is never not to meet Georgians. All went to Georgia. Hopefully maternity leave. Sighnaghi means "shelter" in translation. The legend says a couple in love took refuge here from their pursuers and started her first family. We have to pay you interest, your tourists eat the most. And if you heard what legends I tell about love. From love here only legends remained. Or maybe there was no love either? Who will check this now? Why check? Who's stopping love? Yes, it's all bullshit. Cakes again, huh? Does he know that you like sweet things? Leave, do not spoil the bread. Why are you hitting me? You are not my father. Why are you sending her compliments on a plate? Don't you know that women like to listen to sweets more than to eat. Don't forget the ring. Margarita is one of Pirosmani's most famous works. The legendary love story is associated with a French actress, depicted in this picture. The artist Pirosmani presented Margarita with a million scarlet roses. In the early morning, a cart filled with flowers appeared in front of her window. Some considered the artist insane, others as a knight. But since then no more woman has seen from her window such a beautiful declaration of love. Dear passengers, this is the captain of the ship. Our flight is at thirty thousand pounds. I won't interfere? No, please sit down. Thank you. Yes, not for anything. And then, you know, it's boring there alone. Ah, I understand. How is the shoulder not worried? No normal. Good.

They should know with whom they let the girl go for life. Correctly? Straight for life? Yes. I'm sure for life. When I saw her, you know, I immediately understood, this is my destiny. You know, it happens, you look into the eyes and you know what it is at first sight. Do you know? To her. You can't escape fate, especially without a lawyer. Funny. Let's drink better. No, no, no, I don't drink. I have no immunity to alcohol, I immediately like porridge on a plate. Little by little. Get away from the window. And to do, the heat on the street. Though sometimes it is necessary to ventilate, I will suffocate. I brought you groceries for the week. Whose apartment is this? My relatives were left for sale. Why couldn't I stay there? I told you to get away from the window! Because you are wanted, you will be arrested. Good. But time will pass and things will become clearer. Yes, it will clear up. You can always give up. Don't answer calls. What if someone rings the doorbell? No one will come except Zuki. He will water the flowers, work out and leave. He has a concert soon. But still a child will see me and tell someone. Listen, at least he plays Mozart, but he is my son, he will not betray you. And so I will warn him, as if you were not here at all. But do I need to talk to someone? Yes, he is not going to entertain you, I told you, he has a concert. Okay, I'll be back in a week. Be young. Everything will be fine. Went.

It's me. Tell me please, where do you dance? I was already told that Georgians love football, but there was no one at the stadium. Say I'll dance with her. Where is the butterfly? Wear and wear. Of course, he loves it only when the team plays. When does she play? In three months. Tell me better where you dance. Hello. Goodbye. Why should I pretend? Because it's necessary.

Doesn't take here. Yes, he didn’t leave you, he got untied on the plane. He can't drink at all, idiot. They won't understand, just two days. The guests will leave and I will help leave from here.

He will come and buy your hotel along with parking. Shut up, huh? Sorry. We will return everything. Only in the evening, really. Les, let's go. Some of you will have to stay here. But I will stay.

God, who did I mess with? There is no problem, they are family. Here, without surrender. My opinion is to live by your own mind. If I had listened to my father, I would have been sitting in a boring Swiss bank. with sleeves on the elbows. Why didn't you listen to him? He says you need to honor your parents, and especially your father. Who is it? A woman. Sister. She is married? Divorced. No. What does "take" mean? Is she a thing? How will he keep her? You might think you have oysters in the mountain rivers, is there champagne? What will he talk to her about? It is not necessary to wave a dagger in front of her, but a credit card. If you want to get married, get married, your mother, I'm not sorry. Just find a good lawyer. It'll all be over soon. Everyone will disperse. I'll explain everything. Do not worry. You are not bad here. Nature is beautiful, quiet... Do you love her? My wife. We are getting divorced, something did not work out. What didn't work? I don't know. She also used to run like you. As light as a feather. Your fiancé told me right. Yes, I myself thought that you can meet your half only once. I would like to have a sweet life. But he is silent all the time. My dear, there are men who cannot talk about love, but love more than those who just talk. Got me, chicken. Where is big Leo? Come on you. I ask you, where is he? Show. They wanted like Pirosmani. How pretty is she. Your hair is beautiful. Thank you. What, are you sick? Be healthy. This is a balanced diet. Chickpeas replace fish, meat, all sorts of vitamins. What kind of meat is this? Meat in khinkal. Are there men there? No, no, you're wrong. I didn't order. Sorry, it's from that table. If I'm lucky, you'll be the loudest kid in the world. I loved you... Thank you very much, thank you for everything. Goodbye. See you. You drive me crazy. You can't do that, huh! Who was that? My father's people. They will find us, and they will send me home. What to do now? What to do, get out of here! Where to fall? Let's blow to the airport now. How will we fly? Hares? I'll come for you. Wait for me there. And at the end of our journey, I would like to lead you to the man's house, whose silence said more than all the words of love. He turned his life into a real legend. Take a look around and you will see how a legendary love story is being born before our eyes. Let him not come. Why does he need more trouble? Here he is, let's go. Take off the belt. No belt, left it in a safe place. What, did you sell? Enough for tickets. Hello. Well, with God. Good walk, huh? I completely forgot about your jacket. Nothing, leave it to yourself. No, you are already without a belt. See you probably. Happy. You should have seen, doctor, how I beat them. They really love each other, doctor. Do not move. Is everything OK? How are you feeling? Gamarjoba, I'm Sasha. Are you relatives, yes? Sorry for being late. There was no helicopter. And where is Sofiko, where is the bride? Translation. What happened? I said she shouldn't have gone to the city. Another suitor has arrived. The bride and groom ran away last night. Who are you? Transfer? Did I say something wrong or did I? Is this a custom? I'm really a fiancé, can you show your passport or something? I am the groom! Wait, son. Maybe he really is our fiancé? Ask about the balalaika. Balalaika? Here is the balalaika. I am the groom. Here is our fiance! I'm the groom, you understand? They say it's their fiancé. Here is a mountain goat, did not have time to get a divorce, he was already married. No, it's some kind of mistake. How did he even get here? Where is he? Sasha! Hi fiance. Artem. I'll go earlier today. Tomorrow I have a concert. We have to hand out tickets. Can I go too? No, you can't, you're wanted. You will be arrested. Please play some more. I'm not that bad, I'm just really bad. I feel very bad. Can't you see? Well, you're so big, you can do anything. You have so many men. Well, what do you feel sorry for me alone? I will be a very good mother. I promise you. Well, you must help me. Sorry. What floor is this already? Fifteenth. Carefully. Let's drink? Let's. Only without toasts and dances. You rest and I will come. Be kind, ladies. Please. What are you doing here? I help. Helping? Butterfly. Here. It carries. Performed by a quartet of students of the music school named after Zachary Puvliashvilli, the folk song "Suliko" was performed. Our concert will be continued by third grade student Zuko Tserikidze. Nadia, hello. It's me. Why aren't you on stage? This concert is in two parts. So there is hope to hear from you. Well, if not me, then one of my students for sure. By the way, thanks for the flowers. I did my best. You are dirty. It's blood, cut. Sorry. I will come now. How much can you talk? If I'm lucky, you'll be the loudest child in the world. Helga, hello, I didn't mean to disturb you, I couldn't wake you up. Helga, please call me. I'll probably get fired from my job Do you remember how we sang yesterday? You know, it seemed to me that you like this song and I decided you write it down... Is that you? I took a photo and edited it. Rest is good for you. Where is Sophie? And they tell me that Sofiko left, that she got married for this one. Who is he? Sasha, where have you been? Where was I? I flew to you. I didn't have a helicopter. Quiet, calm down. Quiet. What is quiet? I've been waiting for you, really, and I love you. Justice? Yes. How did you find me, Lord? Where did you get this helicopter? Thank you. You know I missed you so much. It's so beautiful here. Wait, Tem. There is wonderful nature here. We will come here with you. Yes, hello. Something happened? No, nothing happened. You and I were divorced, Tem. We are divorced. First place in the competition of young performers won ten-year-old Zuko Tsirikidze from Georgia. His passionate manner of performance convinced the jury and delighted the audience. This concludes our release. And it remains to add just a few words. For those who are lonely. Who forgot how to walk barefoot on the grass. Who has five hundred friends on the Internet and not one in life. For those who are always busy. For people like me until recently. Then it seemed to me that the legend was given to adults as consolation, like fairy tales for children, to sleep sweetly. It seemed to me that all the best is in the past, and day after day passes according to the schedule, in which they completely forgot to enter feats, passions ... Until one day I suddenly noticed that the mountains are motionless, as in legends, the sea is huge like in a fairy tale, and a feat is something that we can accomplish ourselves. That you need to live now and here, and not wait for tomorrow, and not hide emotions, to act, to err, to repent, to forgive and to love. Because wherever and whenever a person is born, he is born for love. For love for your family, for the house, for the river near the house, to your land, country and its neighbors, for the love of the sun and moon, for the stars that shine for you and everyone, for their planet, the only place in the entire universe where a man can meet a woman. And where they will love each other. Hello. Olya, I shaved my mustache! And I'm bringing you khachapuri, khachapuri! What time are you leaving?
