BITTER INNOCENCE Director of photography Production design: Wardrobe: Editor: Screenplay: Direction: You, here? Have you lost your mind? Something happened. And now we have to talk. What happened, then? I quarelled with Andreas. I have to know if you still need me. What's in it for me? Aren't you missing something? Something you desperately want? - What's your role in this? - I can help you get it. Maybe I already got it. Maybe you don't. Why would you give it to me? Because I made up my mind- Stop your lying! Are you Robert Larssen? I brought you something. Something you need. Eva! NINE DAYS EARLIER Eva. See you later, little one. Eva! It's half past eight. Hurry. I can't take you. I'm going to the club. Here I am. - Morning. - Morning. - J?rgen! - I'm with you in a sec. Morning. - Morning. - Morning. - That's last quarter? - It's not as bad as it looks. - That's what you said three month ago. - What can I do? Promono was a flop and the carrier was high risk. We all know what happens if I present this for the quarter. Hold back on the report and I'll write an explanation. It'll be off our backs till the end of the year. Tomorrow we'll talk about the carrier. How are we explaining the 15% cost overrun? This is Brandt's. "The Magic Flute" It's you, Maria. I'm on my way. Why isn't 'The Magic Flute' part of our season tickets? Ms Hartmann? I borrowed Ms Hartmann briefly. I hope you don't mind. Of course I mind when someone orders my staff around. Come on, Mr Brandt, we all have to pull our weight Is that it? The pile was higher when I had your job. If I remember correctly, that was before the research budget was halved. I, however, never passed the buck. Mr Larssen. Why are you sticking your nose into stuff that's none of your business now? You'll know soon enough. What did he want? Being part of management he can inspect the reports, I'm afraid. Not that. I meant the bit about "You'll know soon enough"? Oh, that. Only a rumour, I think. - Hello sweetie. - Guess what this is. Biology, isn't it? Can't you help me? Otherwise I'll get an F. - Dinner's ready! - But don't tell Mum. I'll see what I can do. No dessert for latecomers. - Are there places to swim? - Not sure. There must be some. Besides, there's a great museum and a sculpture garden. I want the seaside. We haven't been for ages. It's only a week. It might be short notice for the seaside. Not again a stupid mountain village. I don't want spend our first trip in two years just running around. - But you did like Finland. - Fish! What's wrong with fish? I don't mind fish. I do mind fishing. I'll call Hanna. She's lived there for a year. And this time I'd like a cottage with two bedrooms. SECOND DAY Get me an anti-allergic cream on the sly and you'll get a piece of my budget. I wouldn't need to buy from the French. - You'd pass on your trip to Paris? - Paris isn't what it used to be. You're not as sprightly as you used to be. It just came in through internal mail. For you. Excuse me. So? Speak up. You'll receive it, too. How I loathe this. Welcome home. If your life is so unbearable you can't even say 'Hello' let me know. Until then, how about a bare minimum of civility? What is it this time? You don't care anyway. - What's worrying you? - Nothing. I had a fight with Katja. Is that all? Tomorrow you'll make up again. Hey! We're not little children! I just had a chat with Paul and she has to ruin everything. - Who's Paul? - You don't know him. - Is he nice? - He's alright. Of course he's nice. Then it's all good, isn't it? How did you get Dad back then? What would you be willing to do to get noted for once? I don't have to take this from you. Monika, I'm sorry but don't wait for me tonight. No. Don't bother. Can't say yet. All department heads have to attend a meeting but no one knows what it's about. Just says "re. internal corporate structure" - whatever that means. I'll make up for it. Day after tomorrow? How? - "The Magic Flute". - What? Master an instrument in two days? No. An evening at the opera. - Phew! Lucky me. - Day after tomorrow. Promise? Yep. Ladies and gents, dear colleagues. To end all circulating rumours, FDT Pharma Management requested your presence here today. High level negotiations have been held in the last weeks with Vidapharm S.A. Result: a merger agreement of Vidapharm and FDT Pharma was agreed upon three days ago. Hence, all department heads are requested to submit an early financial statement for their sectors in the next eight days. Mr Robert Larssen will lead a committee to evaluate the documents and to determine the type of restructure according to its most promising aspects. For an overview of our new partner Vidapharm consult the folder in front of you as required. Thank you. And now a small addendum to our dear colleague's rather technical statement. The coming changes present a break as well as a great opportunity, for us to be more effective and successful in a global pharma market that's increasingly more densely populated. I appeal to your ambitious selves to accept these challenges. Thank you. Please join me now next door for a small reception. Why wasn't I told until yesterday? Here's the shot you've always wanted. Take it. You bet. In four months time, who here will still have keys to their offices? Well over a quarter, at least! They can stuff their fucking folder. The budget of their research department equals that of the Defense Department. Want to know how many patents they registered this year? I feel sorry for you, Andreas. - I'm sorry! - Let me guess: public relations? No, research. Then research this. It'll go down a treat. You're welcome! Who? ...who of us will be made redundant within 4 weeks? - I think it's rather positive. - Think what you like. - Do the next round for me? - Sure. - Have to pop out a moment. - Hurry. They're nearly done. "Archive" "Archive" "Medical Storage Room No unauthorised access" '...died here...' '...died...' '...died...' I stayed up waiting and reading. How was it? Everything alright? Nothing. It just took longer. Signing of contracts. A few drinks. I'm sorry. Tomorrow. THIRD DAY 'My name is M?nchens.' Breakfast! 'Died on 17 December 1990.' Your coffee's getting cold. - Morning, sweetie. - Not today. Everything alright? In eight days everything will be fine. Our holidays start. Good morning, Mr Brandt. Sorry. Good morning. - So, it wasn't just a rumour. - Don't worry about it. Have Robert Larssen come here. To his office? Alright. - You have 2 minutes. - Then don't bother sitting down. Don't be insolent. About eight years ago this department was run by an ambitious doctor. - A lot has changed, unfortunately. - Yep. - The man's name was Larssen. - So? He wasn't fussy about the means he used. Among his means was 'H17'. You know you're done for when word gets out. Don't waste my time. What's this about? It won't get out if the research department survives. Is that your wife? She looks pale in the picture. Well? I can't make your figures better than they are. Make sure they don't stand out. Anything else? Why did you do what you did to the girl? - Do you gamble? - What's that to do with the girl? How can I explain to someone like you? I'll be in touch. "The lake may pity, but the viceroy will not. Come, venture, man! Save him! Save him! Save him!" "Though 'twere my brother" "Though 'twere my brother, or my darling child, I would not go. It is St. Simon's day, The lake is up, and calling for its victim. Naught's to be done with idle talking here. Time presses on, the man must be assisted. Boatman, will you venture? No, not I. In God's name, then, give me the boat! With my poor strength, see what is to be done!" Want me to clap? As you like. - I still don't get it, though. - Well, listen. You recognise this scene, don't you? I'll explain later. This is Brandt. I'll write it down. So, 40 18 23 10. Why Trumol? It didn't work last time, either. We'll try again. Even if it works, they'll never okay a soporific made of synthetic hormones. They're too worried about protests. If it works it sells. And they'll approve. - Mr Brandt. - Not now. - What is it? - Your wife called. A co-worker wasn't able to reach you. Her name is Vanessa Kr?ger. - The number is 40 18 23 10. - One second. - 40 18 -what? - 40 18 23 10. It's not an internal number but that's the message. The name is Vanessa Kr?ger. Yes? I put the papers on your desk. - What papers? - Biology. - Did you get my message? - I can't hear a word. It's due in two days. The co-worker who called. Ms Hartmann wrote it down. Turn it down. - Can you do it? Please. - Didn't she tell you? Get started. I'll have a look later. A co-worker called. You weren't there so I told Ms Hartmann. I was in the lab restarting a stalled project. The bread basket? I don't know her. She said it's about last night's meeting. Yeah, it's related. Turn it off. It drives me crazy. Well? Andreas, I'm talking to you. Well, what? Nothing! I get enough crap all day at work. "FOURTH DAY" Bye, see you later. - Dad? - Slept well, my big girl? Quite well. Do you think I look weird? You look like my little princess. No. I meant am I too fat or something? Who said that? I fought with Katja. We planned on going out in a group before our trip. But now she's going without me. Don't you believe her. Where were you going? A gig or a movie or something. Can Mum pick you up? - You gave her money again? - She's going out with a friend. - She has to get by on her allowance. - Damn! If anyone has the right to be pissed off it's me. Only last week we finally agreed she gets enough money. - What's it now? - I'm talking to your father. - Oh, yeah? - Andreas. - Stop yelling! I'm not yelling. What's up, damn it? Not a thing. Try to be on time tonight at least. No wonder he's never home. Your constant yelling... Excuse me? No. There's nothing. The project's title was 'H17'. - Own project or licensed? - I wouldn't know. - How old? - Eight years. Maybe nine. Then it's not computerised. Old stuff is still on paper files. Not here either. It's no point issuing a search request. If we don't have it, it never existed. Ah, well. Thanks. Must be a mistake. - Rejected. No funds released in the current situation. - And now? We need a provisional okay. I could talk to Schreiner or Larssen. - No. I'll do it myself. - We can't start without it. I'll talk to Larssen. But not before tomorrow. Get going anyway. Have a seat. - Hardly worth it. - As you like. I'm sorry for what happened. It took you two days to realise that? Careful what you say now. What were you even doing there? - And you? - I work there. I see. 'What's she snooping around for? It's her own fault if stuff happens.' As simple as that? - You had no business there, either. - What do you want? It's not that I don't care but I can't change it. Nobody can change it but someone has to pay. Someone always pays, right? Leave a note in case he pops in again. I went to the opera. Underline the word "opera". Thanks. Your special dessert's in the kitchen. Don't be so impatient. If Dad said he'd come he will come. If he calls, I left his ticket at the door. - But they don't admit latecomers. - Okay. - Don't stay up late. - Sure thing. I work in a department store. I advise people buying perfume. I'm good at it but I don't enjoy it. The whole day standing up, dealing with unpleasant people. I only working part-time now so I accept odd jobs. Sometimes I do receptions. You familiar with those? - Handing out drinks from a tray. - So? Where do I come in? - Tell me his name. - Who? The one who did it. - I don't know. - So, find out. Why me? It's as if both of you did it. As if it was you and him. Do you remember? Did it feel good? Did you forget? Shall I tell you? I do remember. I'll break it down for you bit by bit in case you forgot. I already told you. I can't help you right now. Too much pressure at work. But it's nearly over. - And you'll help me then? - Yes. Why should I believe you? - Why would I trust you? - I promise. I'll... Is there anything I can do in the meantime? Until I can help you? Alright. Put a price on your bad conscience. Tomorrow, your office. No. Not at the company. Why? Am I embarrassing you? - Where do you work? - I'll tell you. Your wife's at the opera. Sorry, Monika. Andreas hasn't come. Thanks, Hermann. No worries. - Good evening. - Good evening. Good evening, Mrs Brandt. Good evening. So, do I have to guess where we met before? It'd give me greater pleasure to be recognised by the ravishing lady. I might not manage during the intermission. In that case I'll help. My name is Robert Larssen. I work at FDT. Your husband's predecessor. - We met 2 years ago at a launch party. - I admit, it just came back to me. Where is your husband? Don't say he dislikes culture. Looks like it, tonight. I might be wrong. Most likely I'm wrong. But last time I met him he seemed to be... ...stressed. In a muddle. Since you brought it up, there was a call from the office. You might know her. Vanessa Kr?ger. No. I don't think so. Why do you ask? It's just... this doesn't tend to happen. What do you mean? Calls from the office. To our home, I mean. No. I can't imagine that it means anything. If it helps I'll inquire about her. - Excuse me, I... - Call my office tomorrow. I'm sure there's a simple explanation. Let's go. Monika? You here? I thought you were at the opera. Mum was waiting for you. She even called the office. FIFTH DAY - I'm sorry about yesterday. - It's alright, let's not talk about it. - Wow, asters! - It's dahlias, sweetie. What I meant. Can my bunny have them when they're dead? - Don't mind me. I know the way. - But... It's alright, Nadja. Join us. How can I help? If you want results, stop blocking my projects! - So? - Get me provisional approval. - I'll see what I can do. - You do that. - All good? I couldn't stop him. - All good. Get me the records about the reception three days ago. Party service, cleaning company, A list of buffet staff and waiters with names and addresses. - Hello! - How may I help you? I'll have that small package. How about a classic for your wife? Enough? "Perfume Counter" You can never have enough beautiful things. There you go. Robert Larssen, please. It's personal. Hello Mr Larssen. This is Monika Brandt. A perfume vendor? Are you sure? Her name is Vanessa Kr?ger? So she's not company staff? In a department store. She's 19. Yes. Thanks. I might take you up on that later. What are you doing here? What's the matter, Mum? Why aren't you at school? We finished early. When did you get here? Answer me! Sorry, sweetheart. I thought you were at school. You scared me. I've got homework to do. Eat up. There's dessert. I hate to say it but you'll have to start the holidays without me. You don't mean that. It'll be 2, 3 days. I'll come when I can. Dad! It can't be helped, my big girl. - Please, Monika. I can't help it. - Why? I don't want to burden you. It's the restructuring. - What? - It's quite normal. It means I've got to launch the autumn project, early. Now. So, please. Don't be angry. I was looking forward to it. You don't know how much. It's only a few days. We have nearly 3 weeks together. I'm looking forward, too. That was sweet of you, Andreas. She's a perfume vendor, in a department store. What's with the faces? We're doing fine. Compared to others. I read in the papers in Mexico a wife killed her husband's lover. And the funny part? She cooked her for dinner and he didn't notice. - Mum! - Monika. - Yes, darling? If you're so worried about ageing get yourself a good psychiatrist asap. I don't have to take this. Dad. What about my biology homework? I'm not clear-headed enough. Ask your mother. Might do her good. "Perfume Counter" SIXTH DAY She's a perfume vendor. Her name's Vanessa Kr?ger. - I don't think it's that. - No, not that. - Please take a sample. - Many thanks. - Can't go wrong. - 'Bye. - 'Bye. Yes? Are you after anything specific? For yourself or a gift? - Something specific. - That's easier. Just tell me. It's about Andreas Brandt. - What? - I know about you two. What's this? Why is this your business? He's my father. Go away. Get lost! - Thanks for seeing me. - Don't mention it. Your coat. Oh, no. It might be ridiculous but I wanted to become a singer. I danced and sang but it wasn't enough. - When did you quit? - It happened too fast. I was over 20. I held onto the dream until we married. Then it wasn't important any more. - Any regrets? - No. No, I don't think so. I always wanted to live like that. Like me? A home, a place to belong to. It's not as easy as it seems. This house is much too big. I can't remember why I bought it. It's a beautiful house. Why did you come? Perhaps I shouldn't have. I know I shouldn't say this but I'm glad you're here. I, eh... It was nice of you to offer. In the doorway earlier, I wondered how to make you smile again like at the opera. - I took your bathrobe. - Of course. - It's been ages since I've... - I know. When can I see you again? I'll call you. Well, well! You're cooking now, eh? - As you can see. - Now I'm curious. - Still upset about yesterday? - Nope. It's alright. - Where's Mum? - At that weird gym place. - Hello. - Hello. Yum! So, what have you been up to today? I played with beakers at the lab. You? I thought you had female assistants for that. I decided to get a nose job. What you do think? Excuse me? As a Christmas gift. Do you mind? - You don't mean that. - Why not? - Out of the question. - Might turn you into Pinocchio. - Not funny, Andreas. - Relax. You're impossible. How typical. Totally clueless. Do you know what I have to listen to? How could you? - Mr Department Head is way too busy. - You've no idea what it means to work. Stop it! - Eva, back here, now! - Don't yell at her? - Who's yelling? SEVENTH DAY Hey! What do you want here? Did I scare you? And yesterday? Just leave us alone. - Why? - Everything's falling apart. I don't really know your father. What are you saying? I wanted him to help me. It's to do with his company. I didn't want it to... ...that you... There's something I have to find out. It's complicated. I will tell you. But later. Okay? When? What's your name? Eva. Meet me tomorrow night. We'll see. Promise? Yes. Where? If only summer was over. Won't be long now. Maybe I shouldn't have quit back then. I might have ended up on the stage, people below, crying and laughing all because of me. Penny for your thoughts. Got to tell you something. There's something fishy about Vanessa Kr?ger. Either she used your husband or it was his idea. What do you mean? We're missing documents and your husband seems to be involved. Andreas? How? It looks like they might try to sell the material to another company. It'd be worth a lot. But they'd have to disappear abroad. - He wouldn't do it. - I'd be in trouble if he did. He wouldn't do it. No. I don't believe it. It's crazy. Without you I wouldn't have known. If he didn't take them it's merely a passing blip. Otherwise we all have a problem. Let me look if he has them, okay? - "Look", how? - In your house. Half an hour, no more. - I don't think I can. - Think about it. I won't let the little slut spoil everything for you. I had second thoughts. - It's not enough. - What? I can't help you if you're not more sorry. I can imagine it's hard for you but this isn't the way. I can imagine what happens if I talk about that night. Bring the same amount again. I'll be at home, waiting. Mr Brandt. It's Larssen. Urgent. What do you want? No way. - What? Rejected again? - You know it's not just me. Right now, there are no approvals, not even provisional ones. - I really tried. - That's your problem. Try again! I'll take you down with me. Kindly run amok in your office, not in mine. Shut the door. Count it. I owe you an apology for earlier. It was... Returning to the place it happened. It brought it back. It wasn't this. It suddenly hurt and I wanted to talk about it. Thanks for coming. What can... I do for you? Maybe you can explain, help me understand better. What were you doing there? What was so important you left without... ...doing anything? Why? What's the point of knowing? Some things don't have explanations. The man who did this to me scares you too, doesn't he? You know who, don't you? - I told you I'd help, but- - Why don't you say who? You're lying, Brandt. You talk like a liar. I thought you'd help. There's nothing I can do now. Be patient. Get lost. Go away, you... I won't believe you again. Scram! EIGHT DAY Hello, darling. Was today the big day? "Report Card" Quite a day! Let me see. Don't give me that look. I know it's shit. Oh, Eva. I know it's better this way. We'll stay, too, and I'll ask Marion about private classes. You explain it Eva. She won't like it. I know. But how else can she catch up next year? You know she struggles, and these holiday classes are really good. So, you're going without me, are you? - No, how can you think that. - But? - We've decided to postpone the trip. Oh, great. Now, what? You know, I think- We think, you should use the time off to catch up with your school work. Since... Since Dad can't make it on time, anyway. Good job, you. Please cancel our recent booking. Yes, Brandt. I do understand. Charge it, then. No. Private reasons. Yes, thanks. - Here I am. - Come on, sit. - So, did you tell them we're meeting? - Who? Your parents. - My Mum isn't interested in me. - And your father? We'd planned a trip to the seaside for a few days' time. - What happened? - They've changed their minds. What happened's... I don't know. They're freaking out. They hardly talk to each other. When they do they scream at each other. No idea what it is. What happened there? What did you do to him? I worked at your Dad's company. They booked me as hostess. They stood around and got drunk. Your Dad was there. Office parties are all alike. At some point the bad jokes start. I couldn't bear it. I thought I'd be sick. I left to find a quiet corner downstairs. - Who's that? - My friend Gregor. Go ahead. Hello. I had a bit of coke on me, I wanted to indulge my soul briefly. No idea how. Suddenly there was someone. He assaulted me. He raped me on the table. Suddenly, there was your father, holding a folder, looking at me. Then he just left. I don't believe it. I don't believe you. It can't have been him. Not Dad. It wasn't him. It doesn't hurt. How did you get our address? The company's so proud of your Dad they printed his photo. They all look alike. The rest's in the book. Do you believe me? Mum thinks you sleep with him. Why would she? Because you phoned him. That night he stood her up at the opera. Your father gave me money. Something's going on in the company. He promised to help me. But I don't trust him any more. - What's next for you? - No idea. Leave. And me? - You believe me, don't you? - I'm scared. If you can't bear it - come here. Where have you been, Eva? - Eva, where were you? - Answer! - Since when do you care? - It's half past 2. Stay! It's half past 2. Tell me where you were at once! Let go! - Why don't you ask Mum. - What? Ask her about her important chats with Mr Larssen. Eva. - What's this? - No idea what she's talking about. Go. Go to your room. So what, I called Larssen. None of your business. - If you don't tell me- - What do you want to know? - What did Larssen say? - The girl you sleep with. - What? - Vanessa Kr?ger. She sells perfume in a department store. - Well? - Look. - No way. - Look at the god-damn file. 6 days ago they announced a merger. I didn't want to worry you. Lately my department hasn't been doing well. It happens. Right now it'd be our end. Our department has to make way for others from the merger. Just like that. Larssen tried to destroy this file on that night. Luckily, I was faster. This file is leverage for Larssen to save the department. Jesus! - And the girl? - Vanessa Kr?ger is... a sales girl who worked as waitress that night. - I don't know Larssen's plans but I have no time for affairs! - Never mind. Larssen decides in 2 days' time when all reports are due. He can't have his concealed mistakes come to light now. - Everything will be forgotten. - In 2 days. NINTH DAY I know who it was. No need to leave now. His name is Larssen. It's him my father is afraid of. "Death certificate" 'My name is Rolf Drossen.' "Result of illness: died on 20.08.1990 at noon" 'I died on 23.11.1990' 'My name is Erika Weichzeh' "Died 22.04.1990 at 11" "Died 18.09.1990 at" "2 children" "Died 23.11.1990" "Died 20.03.1991 at 10 am" They had another fight. My Dad says Larssen is finished if that comes out. They all died back then. "Died on 05.02.1991" He ran the experiment, and signed the death certificates when it went wrong. I won't forget this. - The file's gone. - Can't they take your word for it? Larssen destroyed all other evidence. With the file he's Scot-free. Stop pacing the floor! Larssen! Larssen! Are you going to the police? What then? - To Robert Larssen. - What? To sell him that. - Okay. I'm in. - What? I stole it. Please. I did it for you. - No way. You're only 15. - Exactly. - They can't lock me up. - Yes, they can. - I'll hide it for you. - Your father'll lose his job. So what. He might become normal again. Maybe it'll be like it was. Still, it's dangerous. But I've got you. Good night. I'm off to bed. - Good night? - Eva? Hey! Are you mad? I need a favour, Gregor. Get something for me. TENTH DAY Thank you all. You'll know the decisions shortly. Don't you ever set foot in my house again, Larssen. What, Brandt? You're getting what you wanted. Want me to change my mind? You've won. Enjoy it while it lasts. Now I can tell you, Brandt. Your wife is the lousiest lay I've had for years. Really, Andreas! - He says he doesn't have it. - Doesn't have what? - Larssen. Doesn't have the file. - Could it be a trick? He said he slept with you. - Andreas! - Was it a trick, too? Andreas! - What? - Eva's gone. Larssen! Recognise me? I could 'please' you again but not for free. It's not on me, you idiot. - Where, then? - At yours. I'll be there at 11 tonight. Andreas? Let me go! - So? - In your dreams. Where have you been, Eva? - None of your fucking b- - Where, for days? Wouldn't you like to know. I was at Vanessa's. You, there? What's she planning? Game over. She's got the file, is selling it to Larssen. - You're powerless. - Where? - Forget it. - WHERE? At Larssen's. Tonight. Now. You'll never make it. It's much too late. - What if it's really too late? - I'll kill him. Tell me or else. Where's the file? Maybe it's here? Sleep on it. Tomorrow I'm back. Maybe you'll remember where it is. Andreas. We'll use the backdoor. There's a building site. Vanessa? Vanessa? If I'd actually kept it here... ...perhaps... ...perhaps he'd taken it, and nothing would have happened, you know? I'll make it right. Please. I'll make it right again. But if you're leaving, I'll stay here alone. With them. Why does it have to be this way? You're left with nothing. It starts all over again. I'll make it right again. It's pointless. It'll take days. Eva was right. It's too late. - Or she lied. It's not here. - Then, what? There's something you could do. Stop it. What else? You think I like it? Try. For us. You, here? Have you lost your mind? Something's happened. And now we have to talk. What happened, then? I quarelled with Andreas. I have to know if you still need me. - What's in it for me? - Wasn't there something you desperately wanted? - What's your role in this? - I can help you get it. - Maybe I got it. - Maybe you don't. - Why would you give it to me? - Because I made up my mind. Stop your lying! Are you Robert Larssen? I brought you something. Something you need. Eva! Here. It has to look as though he fired the shots. I can't. It says she'll go to the police if we look for her. We're to transfer money. Monthly payments. She'll be back. Surely she'll be back. I don't know if I can wait that long. How about we wait together? Welcome home. KG Subtitles by Tim Cooper and singaporejoe
