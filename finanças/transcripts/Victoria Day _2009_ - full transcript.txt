Give it up! Give it up! [Whistle] [Crowd cheering] Hey, Spektor, can I ask you something? Just out of curiosity, man how open do I got to be to get you to pass the puck? 'Cause, honestly, man I don't think I've ever been that fuckin' open in my entire life. You're such a stupid prick, Chapman. Chapman, go sit your ass down. So why is it every time I come in here I get the feeling like you're starting some fucking thing? I don't know, Coach. But I'm, like, hurt you feel like that. Ben, great game. Fantastic game. Thanks. That second goal, you were just like Gretzky. You know, you kids keep it up, you'll fly through the first round. Yeah, I hope so. Don't you think so, Jordan? Oh yeah, Dad. Ben's a great hockey player. The rest of us, we really do look up to him. Hey, didn't you have another stick? Oops. Right, as always. Okay, I'll catch up with you guys in the car. Let's go. Pa, your massage table's in here. Four-three. I did okay. Two goals and an assist. [Russian music on stereo] I don't know. Twelve o'clock. Eight. Yeah. Okay. Okay. What do you mean by [Russian]? Drugs, sex, hot dogs? Shotgun! Oh, you're dead. Open the door! Singing to Dylan song on radio: People carry roses And make promises by the hours My love she laughs like the flowers Valentines can't buy her [Blues music over P.A.] Fuck, I love this shit. Hey man, what are the odds? Yo, Alex. You know Ben, right? Yeah, sure, man. You're the dude on Jordan's team that can actually fucking play. Listen, man, we're kind of in a situation here. Over the difference of, like, five bucks. So, uh... You want me to give you five bucks so you can buy drugs? Okay. First, man, I'm not asking for a donation. I'm just asking for a loan. It's not like I'm not going to pay you back. And second, it's not going towards drugs. It's going towards good drugs. What are you, my father? Shit! Man, I told you he wouldn't do it. Just shut up, man. Don't be such an asshole. It's five bucks. Go fuck yourself. You're the man. I'll pay you back at practice. Hey. Dude, if I get black, you can't get black. What? You're going to be the only guy in Toronto with black? Come on. Just this once, try to have a mind of your own. Eat me! I want black, I'm getting black. I'm going to take this. Oh come on, dude! Not you, too. You don't even like black. I'm just looking. I'm getting that one. Thank you. See, Noah, why can't you be more like Ben? 'Cause I want to be just like you. Yo, man, can I put this in your bag? Hurry up! Let's go, dickweed. Bob Dylan singing over P.A.: Don't need a shot of turpentine Only bring me to my knees Don't need a shot of codeine To help me to repent Good morning, Mrs.MacTeer. Hurry up or she'll start without you. Sorry. Ben, I think it's my turn. I know it totally is. But I was just hoping you'd let me go and then you can take it the next two times. I already cued up my tape. You can take the next three times. Please. Please. Please. It's just because of the concert last night. Are you even cued up? You're the best. It'll be just a second. We have to get started. Okay. Ready. All right, you read the yellow parts, okay? All right. Good morning. This is NSFM for Monday, May 20th. Ben over P.A.: The United Way congratulates all the staff and students of Newtonbrook Secondary on our successful fashion show fundraising. The final tally is in and this year's fashion show contributed over $2,400 to United Way. Special thanks goes to Myrna Sable who put the show together and made it the most successful Newtonbrook fashion show ever. Way to go, Myrna. A reminder to all the members of the Computer Gaming Club, the Multicultural Club, the Environmental Society and the Volleyball Team. You'll be meeting at your usual times, in your usual places after school today. And this song is dedicated to everybody who went to the show last night and everyone else who wishes they did. [Bob Dylan music over P.A.] Didn't you play this last time? Yeah, yeah. Probably the time before, too. You know he wrote some other songs. I could lend you a tape. That's all right. I'm kind of into this one right now. Listen to it at home. I do. Bob Dylan singing: ...and it is time for me to slide I live in another world where life and death are memorized Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls And all I see are dark eyes Dude! Any time you're ready, you can kick it back. No big hurry. I understand you're busy with some important staring and all. I wasn't staring at anything, man. Noah, was he staring? Yeah, he was staring. Ben, I really hope you're not stalking that girl. I mean, she's only fifteen. And she's also Chapman's sister. Ack! If you married her you'd have Chapman as a relative. You'd have kids that look like Chapman. All right. Are you finished? Noah, are you finished? I'm never finished. Oh! Check that out for eye-foot coordination. Yeah, you're really gifted, Noah. Dude, there's a field party near Northview tonight. I can't, man. I got hockey practice. Oh, come on, skip it. Are you kidding? We're in the playoffs. Dude! I tit-fucked a girl there two weeks ago. I saw that girl. Go to practice. Did I say she was hot, Noah, you fucking jerk-off artist? I just presented the facts. I mean, my dick, her tits... sexual satisfaction. So what do you say? Hockey practice. Hey, Cayla. There's a field party tonight near Northview. Would you like to come? Tonight? Yeah. Tons of people will be there. You know, before exams. Should be cool. What time? Come at nine. You need a lift? 'Cause Ben's driving. No, it's okay. I like to ride my bike. Cool. Did any of you guys see my brother at the show last night? No. I don't think so. No. Why? Just wondering. So you still got hockey practice? Fuck you, Sammy. Noah, what did he say? "Fuck you" or "thank you"? I can't be there before 10 o'clock, okay? Naw, that's okay. I'm in no hurry. Come by my place first. That way I can drink. [Whistle] [Whistle] [Whistle] Pick it up! [Whistle] Bring it in, boys! Let's go! Anybody talk to Jordan? No? He didn't call anyone, say he was going to miss practice? All right. We're going to break into offence-defence. We'll start three-on-twos. Brad, you go up on Ben's line, okay? Let's go. [Whistle] [Indistinct shouting] [Whistle] Go! [Moody instrumental music] [Hockey announcer on TV] Pa, I can't. I gotta go out. Out! I promised Noah. [Hockey announcer on TV] [Hockey announcer on TV] Gretzky? Too bad I don't play like that all the time. Yeah. Noah needs help with something. There's no more homework, mum. Everybody's just studying for exams now. Yeah. He needs help. [Hockey announcer on TV] [Guitar-playing: "Wild Thing"] Hey. You play something by Hendrix? [singing] Come on and... Sock it to me one time! [Pops tongue] You move me... Dude. Stop. You're embarrassing yourself. Wild Thing... Seriously, why do you play in public? I am the Lizard King. I can do anything. Can you give me a smoke, Lizard King? Fuck you. So have you guys been here long? Long enough. Oh, this is my friend, Melanie. Melanie, that's Ben and Noah. Hi. Hi. [Bicycle bell] If I don't stop him, he's going to break that. It's okay. Sammy! I'm sorry. He's an idiot. Thank you. It's all right. The chain falls off all the time. [Moody instrumental music] I should probably just let you do it. It's tricky the first few times. Could you lift up the back? Sure. I hope you're not going home 'cause of Sammy. No. Sammy's funny. I had to go anyway. My dad's waiting for me. Okay. He's home by himself. He's worried 'cause Jordan never came home from the concert. Yeah. He wasn't at practice, but I didn't know. In January he was gone for three days. He went to a Grateful Dead show in Syracuse. And he came back. Well, I'm sorry you have to go home early. Thanks for helping with my bike. I didn't really do that much. That's true. [Indistinct chattering] Hey. Hey. Where did everybody go? They went into the bushes to have a ménage à trois. They'll be back soon. Do you want a beer? Yeah, sure. They're kind of warm. That's okay. Thanks. So is she your girlfriend? Who? The girl with the bicycle. No. She has nice hair. Your friends said that you're stalking her. Yeah, only on Tuesdays and Fridays. But today's Monday. Yeah, it's my day off. That's why I came back. Dude, we just made Sara smoke the fattest joint. [Giggling] What the fuck is this? It's one of my dad's Russian tapes. Dude, put it on. [Russian music] [Music off] Pick something else. So what happened, man? Where? With Cayla. I set you up perfectly. I mean, you got to look like the knight in shining armour fixing her bike and shit. Nothing happened. Nothing? No, we just talked. You are so full of shit! You touched her tits, didn't you? She has great tits. You know who else has great tits? Sara's friend, Melanie. Well, did you at least touch hertits? No. She wouldn't let me. She said it breaks her concentration when she's giving a blow job. Oh, you fucking asshole! We were only gone for, like, three minutes. So, did you see that? What? There was a sign for fireworks. It's just a sign, numbnuts. So Cayla was saying that Chapman never showed up after the Dylan show last night. What? Chapman never showed up after the concert. He never went home. Yeah, he wasn't in school, he didn't come to practice. You're kidding. No. He's dead. He probably just tripped out, man. No, he's dead. Sammy, why would you say something like that? I'm just being honest. I mean, if I went to a show and I didn't come home I mean, I'd probably be dead, right? So why wouldn't he? Because even compared to you Chapman's too much of an obnoxious prick. I mean, nothing bad ever happens to guys like that. I saw him before the show. Gave him five bucks to buy drugs. You actually gave that guy money? No wonder you're upset. I mean, if asshole disappears, you're out five bucks. Sammy, you're such a fucking ass-- Stop there! You selling fireworks this late? Yeah sure. I usually stay until twelve. Hey, any of these good? Yeah sure. No, I mean, honestly. Like, on average, how many of these are going to be duds? They're all good, man. How much? Those are two bucks each. How much for the cherry bombs? Twenty-five cents each or five for a buck. Sir, if we buy more than 10 Roman candles could we maybe work something out? No, look, unless you're taking a hundred of them they're two bucks each. Sir, do you realize that it's illegal to sell fireworks out of the back of your van? No shit? In exchange for not reporting you I propose you give us a 50% discount. Okay. I'm prepared to go as low as 30, but that's it. Hey, kid. Why don't you go as low as fuck yourself? Ben/ [Laughing] Twenty-five percent. All right, look, put them back! What? All of you. I don't need this shit. Ten percent. Here. [Laughing and cheering] Hi. So? What? So what did you think of Melanie? Oh, yeah, she's very nice. She wanted me to give you her number. Really? Yeah. Are you going to call her? Yeah, sure. You should. I said I would. You should. You should. Sara, why do you keep repeating that like a million times? I'm not. Just thrice. Ben, Sara... Principal Hastings asked that you read this. We've had to add something at the last minute. Okay. Sara, we gotta go on now. We'll just take turns. Okay. Good morning. This is NSFM for Tuesday, May 21st. All students should be aware that this Friday is picture day. Sara over P.A.: Anyone who wishes to have their picture taken for the yearbook should remember to bring their completed forms and a cheque for $25 to the main gym on Friday. Also, the photographer reminds you that if you are a boy and you're very hairy, like Ben Spektor, please remember to shave the morning of picture day. And a special announcement for all Newtonbrook students. Many of you are probably aware that Jordan Chapman one of our Grade 11 students has gone missing since Sunday night. His family, along with the Metro Police, have arranged for a volunteer search party tomorrow afternoon at 1PM at Ontario Place. Everyone who wants to volunteer for the search party should inform their homeroom teacher by the end of today. [Upbeat B-52s music over P.A.] It was already cued up. [Music over P.A. continues] Hey. Hi. Are you doing this all by yourself? No. My dad and some of his friends are putting up signs on Yonge Street. Do you need some help? It's okay. You don't have to. No, I want to. I'm out of signs. I have to go home and get some more. I could come with you, if you'd like. Okay. Do you want to double on my bike? Are you sure? I'm kind of heavier than I look. You're not heavier than Jordan. You'll see. I can do it. Okay. [Instrumental guitar music] You haven't been here for a long time, have you? Probably not since 5th Grade. I sort of remember you coming over. We mainly stayed in the basement. Your dad put a net down there. My dad sleeps out here now. He says he doesn't like to pretend everything's normal when everything isn't normal. He wants to be close to the door when Jordan gets home. You should know, no matter how Jordan acts he really likes you. He's just a little jealous. I think we get along okay. No, you don't. You think he's an asshole. Everybody thinks he's an asshole. But he's not like that all the time. I know. What's that? Oh, it's a biography on Bob Dylan in Italian. Do you speak Italian? No. I really like Bob Dylan, but I mean, I've read everything in English. I wish I could have been alive in the '60s. Do you ever wish that? All the time. Wish I could have gone to Woodstock. Did you see the movie? Twice. Yeah, I wish I would have been in New York when Dylan played in Greenwich Village. You wouldn't have gone to Woodstock? No. I'd do that too. And I could live in San Francisco or L.A. Like Jim Morrison. It would be so much better than this. Your book. [Moody guitar music] No. All right. I'll be ready. Banana, please. Who? Okay. [Moody instrumental music] Hi. Is Melanie there, please? All right, boys, listen up. Tomorrow, I expect you all to show up for the search. But tonight I expect to go out there and kick some fucking ass! Yeah! [Cheering] Let's go! [Moody instrumental music] [Indistinct chatter] Hey. Hey. You had Don Mills last night? Yeah. It didn't go so well. It's okay. You'll get them. Thanks for coming. I mean, the whole team had to come but... I would have come anyway, you know. Police All right, everyone. I'd like to thank you all for finding the time to assist us in this search. You'll be travelling in groups of roughly 10. And there'll be an officer assigned to each group. In the event that you discover anything do not touch or move what you find. Immediately notify an officer. Now photos will be passed around so that we will all have an idea as to what Jordan looked like and what he was wearing on the night in question. We are looking for anything that may have been on his person. I'm sorry. But I just wanted to say, before we get started... I wanted to say how much this means to me and my family. The fact that so many of you have donated your time to help us find my son. And... Dad? Uh... Dad. Come on. Right. Sorry. I'm getting in the way. Anyway, thanks again everyone from Jordan's school to his hockey team to all of our friends and everyone else thank you from the bottom of my heart. Hey, Ben. Did you catch Game Two last night? No, I missed it. It was pretty good. Gretzky lit it up. The Oilers will take it in five, you'll see. You going to watch the one tonight? Yeah. Do you think it's right that we're playing while all this is going on? What do you mean? Maybe it's disrespectful? We're in the playoffs. Hey, do you know Ray Bourque needs a new pair of gloves after every period 'cause he sweats so much? Really? That's what the announcer said. Does that make him the sweatiest guy in the NHL? Yeah, probably. Makes him the sweatiest guy in the whole fucking world a new pair of gloves every period. TV The search continues here at Ontario Place for Jordan Chapman, missing since... ...searching all day today, no sign of Jordan Chapman. I'm with Noah Hartsman, a friend of Jordan's. Noah, some people say, or there are rumours out there that drugs may have been involved in Jordan's disappearance. Do you think drugs may be to blame? Well, I think it's too easy to just say that drugs are to blame. Teenagers today are exposed to many negative influences. The truth is, I think that society's to blame. He's a good talker. No. TV ...so from Ontario Place, the search will continue... TV Hockey The following is a CBC Sports presentation. Tonight is the climax to a spectacular sports event in Boston, Massachusetts as the Edmonton Oilers and The Boston Bruins meet for Game Three of the Stanley Cup Championship Series live on Hockey Night in Canada. Sammy! Hey! You look like old girlfriend I have in Russia. Nice girl. Drive tractor. [Chuckles] Ben! Sammy's here. Think Edmonton will win? Of course, Edmonton much better team. Yuri, five bucks, four-to-one odds. If I win, I get twenty. And if you win, you get five. Sammy, your parents work hard for money. Why you want to throw it away? Keep your five dollars. Maybe one day, you have enough for haircut. TV Hockey [Indistinct commentary] Sit. Today, no charge. I can't. I gotta change soon. What for? To watch Stanley Cup? Who you need to change for? Sammy? No. I'm going out. Ma, I study. I've got the whole long weekend to catch up. I can't. I promised a girl. I'll watch the next one. Yuri, I'll watch the game with you. See? Maybe I trade you for Sammy. So what did you do? Get a date with dead guy's sister? No. So who? Melanie. Melanie? What are you doing going out with Melanie when you're in love with dead guy's sister? Would you stop saying that? I think I fucked things up with Cayla. Since when did you even have anything to fuck up? I went over to her house to help put up posters we kissed and then she sort of freaked out. What do you mean freaked out? Oh, I get it. So, to fix things you're going to go out with Melanie. Noah rented Platoon. We're going to watch it in preparation. I thought you were going to come. I remember it from last year and the year before that. I don't need preparation. Charlie's in the perimeter! Boocoo zips in the wire! [Gunfire mouth sounds] Didi mao, didi mao! You gook motherfucker! [Gunfire mouth sounds] Get the fuck off! [Laughing] Put my trophy back, you asshole. I thought I'd wait outside. If you came in, my mum would ask a million questions. Okay? Yeah. So is there any kind of music you want to listen to? I don't really care. What kind of stuff do you like? The Eagles, James Taylor... Madonna, Billy Joel, Steve Miller, Cat Stevens... Maybe we can just listen to the radio. 'Kay. [54-40's "Baby Ran" on radio] Does that really hurt? A little. What happened? I got slashed during hockey. It's not that bad. I have them all over. There's one on my side that's much worse. Can I see? I love bruises and scars. Look. It's from a nail on the dock at my cottage. When I was 10, I jumped too close to the edge. Twelve stitches. Your turn. Ow. Yeah. I like your six-pack. [Laughs] [Opening music] I personally thought Dustin Hoffman was much better than Tom Cruise. I mean, like if I had to decide who I'd want to marry like if there was a gun to my head or something I would definitely say Dustin Hoffman. Even though he's kind of old and I couldn't really imagine having sex with someone that old I think I'd still say Dustin Hoffman. I just really liked him as the Rain Man. My mum's asleep if you want to come in. So do you want to listen to music? Sure. I don't know if you'll like this. I heard it on the radio. I really liked it. [T'Pau's "Heart and Soul" on boombox] Am I hurting you? No, it's okay. Well, if you want I can take my bra off and you can do it on my boobs. Hold on. I have some moisturizer in the bathroom. [Music on boombox continues] [Moody instrumental music] Hey, I saw you were up. Did I scare you? No. I thought maybe you were Jordan. Has there been any news? Yesterday somebody called and said they saw him in Buffalo. Today somebody called and said they saw him at a bus station in Hamilton. None of it true? Gets my dad all excited and then depressed. And everyone gets their hopes up. Cayla's Cayla, who is it? Dad, it's okay. Ben. What time is it? It's late. You should go lie down. All I do is lie down. Ben, you should see our house. It's amazing the mess one person can make lying around. Cayla, where's your manners? Maybe Ben wants some tea or a Coke. It's all right. No, it's not. It's the least we can do. Besides the police, who else visits us? So... how's everything going? Is school okay? Yeah. And the team doing all right? That's good. It's good to hear. You know they got me a therapist. Just for now while we're waiting. She says it's very important that I don't lose touch with the outside world. I stay interested in other things. I give my mind a break. I mean, it's only been four days. It feels like a long time. At the bank... they don't even clear a cheque for you in four days. We once drove to California, four days. Across the entire continent. It's such a long trip, only four days. I remember that it passed like that. You understand? Today's Wednesday. It was only Sunday. Not even Sunday -- Sunday night. That's not even a full day, right? Right. Huh? I wanted to tell you... I wanted to tell you before... I saw Jordan before the concert. He wanted five dollars and I gave it to him. Five dollars? What for? To buy drugs. I gave him a hundred dollars for that concert... $20 for the ticket, money for hot dogs and Cokes, money for a T-shirt, he said. A hundred dollars. Where'd all the money go? I gave that kid a hundred bucks and he still had to ask you for more. For him, it's like money grows on trees. How much did he take from you? You said five dollars, right? It doesn't matter. Don't think he isn't good for it. I taught him to always pay his debts. Take it. I don't want the money. Take it. Take the money. And get the fuck out of my house. [Moody instrumental music] [Moody instrumental music] Not now. I can't do this now. You're the one who wants to stay up and talk. You're right. I'll stop playing hockey. I don't think we should be playing when there's a kid missing. I think it's wrong! It's how I feel! Idiot! That's how I feel! Yura. [Moody instrumental music] [Moody instrumental music] Perfect. All right. How do you want to do this? Every man for himself. Oh, yeah. We did that last year. It lacked organization. That's right. Fuck your organization, Noah! This is the 'Nam, man! This is the fucking jungle! [Flare pops] Didi mao! Shit, you crazy fucker! [Love's "Seven and Seven Is"] Didi mao! Didi mao, you motherfucker! Uncle Sam's gonna fry your V.C. ass! Woo! Woo hoo-hoo! Here it comes! Oh yeah! [Laughs] [Music continues] I've got one left. How many do you have? We need a re-supply. Sammy, how many do you have left?! Don't worry about me, you Commie bastard! I've got enough to blow your ass back to Hanoi! How come he's got so many? He drove to a warehouse in Mississauga yesterday. Why didn't he ask us? We were on the search for Chapman. How did he get to go? Well, he signed up. But it's not exactly like they were taking attendance. Fucking asshole! He lied about going on the search? I'm going to fucking kill you, Sammy! What the hell's the matter with you, man? You're a self-centred asshole! What, are you fucking crazy, dude? What the fuck, Ben?! Argh! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit, dude. Where does it hurt? Aw, fuck! My arm. Which one? The right. Dude, I don't think we're supposed to move him. I think it's bad, dude. Fuck! Yuri's going to kill me. Shit! Call Medivac. [Nervous laughter] Medivac! Fuck. What is on your face? What were you boys doing? Where is Ben? Speak, idiots! Open your mouth! Where at?! Jesus Christ, it's myarm. Don't say to me Jesus! [Moody instrumental music] [Music continues] [Indistinct shouting] TV [Indistinct narration] Nice, Mum. Yeah, Ma. It's really nice. No, I'm fine. I don't really feel anything. Okay. [Knock at door] Who's the party for? Yeah. At the Dynasty Star? Uh huh. Pa. If you're going to wear the red tie you should put on the blue suit. No, the tie's fine. It's a nice tie. It's good. Just wear the blue suit. Yeah? TV Hockey ...Edmonton a lead of 4-to-1. Sunday in Game Three, the stakes where high and so were the sticks. Bourque and Gretzky played 30 minutes of game... Okay. TV Hockey ...versus its present MVP. But now Boston's Ray of Hope is waning and 99's again a prime candidate for more acclaim. In these play-offs, the pro and con seem destined to be together... [Phone rings] Hello? Yes, Sammy, he's feeling better. I will give him the phone, okay? Ben? It's Sammy. Got it. Hey. Sammy on phone: How you doing? I'm all right. Kind a handicapped but I'm all right. Sammy on phone: Listen, dude. Noah and I are going to go down to Canada's Wonderland to watch the fireworks, but after that maybe we'll stop by? You mean you're not going to watch the game? Sammy on phone: No, actually, Noah bumped into Sara and Melanie and they sort of invited us. They say hi. Okay. Sammy on phone: But maybe we'll stop by after? Yeah, sure. I'm not going anywhere. Sammy on phone: Bye. All right, bye. You look good, Pa. Just now. Call from the restaurant and I'll tell you the score. Yeah. Don Cherry on ...I'm saying right now Gretzky will be carrying the Cup around in Edmonton. Ron Maclean on Andy Moog played very well in Game One at Edmonton... Okay. TV Hockey ...He gets that chance tonight. His chore is to try to stop the Oilers who are starting with Messier, Anderson and Simpson... Lowe and Muni, the defenseman Bourque and Klusak for The Bruins. With Lindstrom, Crowder and LeMay... Muni taps the puck ahead to centre. Here's Anderson with the first big chance in the game! He scores! Ten seconds into this fourth game Anderson breaks away! And the first shot of the hockey game is in the net! Oilers lead it one to nothing. [Indistinct commentary on TV] TV Hockey The first period this evening Wayne will be our studio guest... ...Gretzky, rebound, scores! ...if you've ever played hockey in a sauna but that's what these guys are doing tonight. And the fog is beginning to be a bit of a problem. TV Hockey ...beats it back to centre ice to Sweeney. More players in on the boards right at the Oilers bench. [Door bell] TV Hockey Feeds it in behind the net... Is it okay if I come in? Yeah, sure. I'm just watching the game. Where are your parents? They went to a party. Do you want anything? TV Hockey That fog is really thick down there now and it's very difficult to see at ice level. Well, it's a problem, of course, for the goaltenders. Especially the one at the other end. I know they like to follow the puck wherever it is... I think I like it better this way. TV Hockey See what happens to the Edmonton Oilers now. And he's made the sign for Edmonton to get out this time. Just to say, who sends them out. And they go down to their end at the far left and skate about. And the Bruins up here to the right... Is it okay if I do this? Yeah. TV Hockey A foggy night in Boston town. Fourth game of the Stanley Cup Final and it's 3-2, the Bruins. They're fighting back and showing a lot of grit here in this hockey game. To get scored on so quickly and then to have a double penalty and get scored on again. If it wasn't the Boston Bruins and the tradition that their B on their sweater stands for you'd kind of wonder if they'd ever do it. That's Roy's wife, Dale, from Toronto. Roy's horse wouldn't start. He couldn't ride in for the game. All right. Dale Rogers. A lot of Canadians down to Boston to catch this series. Kasper loses it to Gretzky! Shoved one in front of Messier, did he hit it? There's a shot! Score-- What happened? I don't know. The power must have gone out. Does your arm hurt? No. Do you want me to help you take your shirt off? Yeah. TV Hockey - ...- 23 remaining in the period and the lights failed us. The lights in the Boston Garden, if you just tuned in have gone out, just in the ice surface area alone... Cayla, maybe we shouldn't do this. Why? [Phone rings] I should get that. It's probably my father. If I don't get it, he'll be worried. Hello? I'm fine, Pa. It's 3-3. But the power went out and they stopped the game. I don't know, but they lost the lights, they can't play. I think they're going to have to suspend the game. Yeah, I think you'll get to watch it. No. It's okay. Yuri on phone Okay. Bye. TV Hockey ...about a year ago. This tripped a switch shutting down the main power. As a result of that... ...But tonight's game had to be called off. At this point, as you know ...the game was at23 left in the second period. Our by-laws provide for a game not being able to be completed. So our by-laws take over in this situation. It's by-law 27.12 and providing for this contingency, it reads and I'll read it... [Sobbing quietly] TV Hockey ...What that mean is this. Game four will be played in Edmonton on May 26th. Game five will be played here in Boston if necessary... [Bob Dylan's "Dark Eyes"] A cock is crowing far away And another soldier's deep in prayer Some mother's child has gone astray She can't find him anywhere But I can hear another drum Beating for the dead that rise Whom nature's beast fears as they come And all I see are dark eyes
