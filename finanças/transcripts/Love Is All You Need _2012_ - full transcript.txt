It's refreshing. Take my jacket. Thank you. Thank you. Moment. Sorry. Ants. And that's not good. If there are ants, wood is certainly attacked by scale insects. What is it? ... An insect. A snyltedyn. A disgusting, little pest... First destroying the fruit and so the whole tree. Females are the worst. Males are harmless. They have no foot... So they can not eat and die within a few days. His life is quite meaningless. Something he must do. ... No, nothing. Females, on the other hand, can reproduce asexually. Strange creatures. Very annoying and very dangerous. Citric are similar to completely oranges. ... It's all of them. The tree was an orange tree in 100 years until it was inoculated with a lemon. These were also oranges, so they must be looked after constantly... In order not to be the orange trees again. It is a time... consuming and endless process. Can the tree low both lemons and oranges? That I like. But lemons are now my favourite fruit. I can not imagine a world without. No. I can not. Did you know that botanically so the lemon is a berry? No. The. Hey, that's mine. Sorry. Okay. Thank you. Here you go. ... Should we not wait at all? That's fine... No, we must. There you are. Did you done your head? ... My head is clear now. We were quite worried. ... You look wonderful. Thank you. Is not it beautiful? ... Ida and I ran together. God, you had his jacket on? Astrid, it looks great. What kind of wine do you want? ... I do not care. It does not matter. They are equally good. I get up, if you need to talk. It is rude to say anything before we have eaten, so I keep it short. As Patrick's aunt, it is right that I say a few words. For you who do not know, then I took me a lot of Patrick. I've been sort of What do you call it? Plastikmor. Papmor... No, now I have! I'd rather be called a mostermor. ... Start with being a mother. And it is I who say to you that it's not all about you. Or about you, Astrid. No, tonight it's all about our everyone's host, Phillip. Phillip, Phillip... Plug prefer your fingers in your ears, for now you're going to blush. Come on, Dad... Come on. Slip your fingers in your ears. Now push your fingers in your ears. Thank you. Patrick, you have the most wonderful father. Astrid, you marry a boy... Whose father has meant everything for me and my daughter. He has been there when my little great daughter struggled with his obesity. I was worried at night. He was there when she cut in the self and what is much worse. So he was there when I some years then divorced my husband. Cruel divorce. Ex... idiot, as I call him. No, now it will not be about me. It's your party. A celebration, Phillip has made possible. The is wonderful, I keep it here... Where he was married to my sister nearly 26 years ago? Even then we had an eye for each other. We sent glances to each other and flirted. Until Elizabeth just grabbed you in front of me. Before I could count to three. No, I do not know what I'm saying. No, seriously. She was a great sister. No, I have just for two seconds. Sorry. Now I'll move on. Patrick. It was so bad for you. Not too, sweetheart? I'm sure she would be proud of you... If she had seen you sit here with Astrid. I'm proud of you, and I 'm sure Phillip is proud. Therefore, I think we should bowls with a quote from Henry Miller: "Love can never get enough of and never give enough of." Or as Herman Bang: "Indifference is love painful precipitate." Bowl. Cheers... Bowl. No. No. It does not matter. Do not worry, honey. Then we have shown good sit. Herman Bang? I have no idea Do you know who this is? Yes, Herman Bang. Yes. It says you just seem wildly clever. I'll do it... No, let me now. Now let me show you. And rub gently. Very gently. Can I just let be? What the hell are you doing? Why do not you sleep? Is there something wrong? Nah. I should have just some fresh air. I think it went really well. So, other than from aunt mother's voice... Your father's girlfriend and saw it with dress. So it went well very well. How it is with families. There are always some idiots. Yes. That the dress was just fun. ... Yes, yes. I think everything is going to go absolutely fantastic. Just go to bed, honey. Okay? We must therefore well have sex before get married. You know that, right? How far should we go in here ridiculous heat? It's really hard. I have only one thing to say. Spinning classes. - You look so different in the clothes. - I know. I tried all Astrid's dresses, but then vaskedejeg it here. Also wedding dress? ... It may be I did not try. Ungrateful children. No respect. Do you all the land here, Phillip? The plot is about 6.5 hectares. It must be damn good cause. What is the unit price of such some little yellow bastards? Do not talk about money. ... I do when not. Honey, try to stop and just enjoy the natural atmosphere. Listen to the birds. They have it all right now. They do not have any money, right? If you do not have other dresses, you can borrow one. I hare, you can fit. They are a little tight, but one has stretch, Ida. So could you maybe put my hair. It could be nice game. Super fine idea, but we must find some tablecloths and napkins... And a nice dress for you, right, Mom? Tilde, come here... Yes. Yes. We must namely... Yes. Try to see it up there. Where is it fine. There is Phillip. I thought they had gone back. I thought so too.

Not just here, but in the South. So she went home to Denmark... And so I stalkede her. Did she like it? ... No, but she got used to it. I worked her and finally, She gave and married me. What happened? ... What do you think? How did she die? Do you mind if I ask?... No. She was just unfortunate. It was a small stupid accident. It was a mother with three screaming kids in the back seat. It was snowing. The roads were slippery. And she was not able to brake. She hit her not particularly hard... But Elizabeth landed just wrong. It must have been terrible. You get over it. I got over it. Patrick came over it. Life goes on. But not to her, she drove. She insisted on meeting us to apologize... And when she finally came, she was just crying. She uttered not a word. She just sat and blubbered. Are you still mad at her? ... No. I'm not mad at her. Now I'm just angry at everyone else. Benedikte. ... I just wanted to see you. I'm fine. Despite all the painful memories. No pain... Good. I can not sleep. I'm so excited. I love Italy. The food, wine, romance. Do not you too?...

Look, Benedikte. I do not want to be rude, but in many years it has been a mystery to me... That you and your sister, Elizabeth, was in the family. She was the sweetest and most beautiful Being a man could imagine. Everything that you are not. I have found myself in you Patrick and Alexandra's sake... And I will continue. That being said.

It's you, he has gone and baked on. Now go down and apologize, and as we dance together afterwards. Alessandro, sorry. I thought you and Astrid. You know. I know I should not have hit him. But I get so fucking mad when I see him. If there was only one good thing at him, but it is not. Yes, there electricity: ... What? Honestly. What was it that you fell for that time? I remember that grandmother said, he ate well. This meant that he was well brought up. I should not have hit him. ... No, but he'll be fine. He is a robust man. It was stupid, I was down here. ... Well was it not. Otherwise we would not have sat here with your feet in the water, the two of us. I'm so glad You broke the arm. Mom, stop... What is it? What is it? Should not you go up to bed? ... Nope. Why? Why are you here? I do not, Patrick will be here, Mom. Why do you say that? There is something very wrong. I know I'm not the most beautiful girl in the world... But he bother me at all. He wants good party and his rotten father and Alessandro... And wine and food and friends. He just does not bother me. Now, you tell me not even the opposite. I'm so stupid, I have not seen it. You are not stupid. You are the beautiful girl in the world. Do not you just, He is nervous and stressed? Yes, but it's not just that. I can tell he is not crazy me. He looks me in the eye. It is hard for him. Then he up and stand on toes. Mother, why must you always be fun on the completely wrong times? Sorry. He is fucking jealous when someone looks at me... And so he did not bother touching at me when we're alone. We have not been to bed together, while we've been here. Do not you just, he's afraid? I do not know. I do not know anything. Patricia, if you siår I'll kill you. The woman driving me crazy. You. Sorry. Is Patrick here?... No. I can not find him. ... What happened? I do not know. He's just gone. Go to bed with you. Do not worry. Hello. What's going on? ... Nothing. It was a stupid idea to get married. No... Yes. I thought that if I was married, and you came here, everything would resolve itself. But no. I'm so stupid! You've also always thought. That's not true... Yes. I've spent so much time to find a way to make you happy at. But it does not matter. Patrick, I know, I have not always been... The world's grandfather. But I never asked you to do something for me. Shut up... I just wanted to. Shut up! You are such an idiot fan A huge idiot. You've been too busy feeling sorry for yourself. Yes. You're probably right in. Sorry. Why do you suddenly up in it? Patrick. ... I do not know what the hell I want. I do not know anything. I feel completely empty inside. Patrick. There's nothing wrong with you. Now go ahead. I'll pull myself together. Come on... No. No. Now go ahead. Go now. Will not you? Hey. I will tell you. We can count on that we will be a little more delayed. Tilde? Is there anything we guests can do to help? No, I do not think there is. Will there be anything to drink? The elderly have the right hot. Shh. Do not say shh. I'm just trying to help. Here you go, honey. Yes, we are sad, but we should not get married. Sorry, we have dragged you down here for no reason. We hope that. We are not enemies. We just can not stand here and lie to each other and ourselves. I am so røvtræt of it with that Now let us, as if everything is fine. Or that we do, as we have always done... Because we get too sad, if we are honest. I'm so tired of your lies. You can not lie through life, just because it's easier. When I look at you, I'm sure... It is the way you are fat and old and unhappy. That I will not be. It's not anybody's fault. Yes, it's fucking nobody's fault. Not Astrid. It is I who have been a fool. Not?... Yes. Sorry. But it does not matter now. We are not right for each other. So we should not. We still have the possibility to select. Now I can not hold your tongue the mouth longer. What should we do? Is there still a buffet? What with all the gifts? I think we need a little information. Okay. So I can say that I try to get home tonight. The rest of you can just do what you want. Come year we. Sorry, Dad. Sorry. Give me some of that. I'm sorry. Thank you for letting us come. Leif? Ida, I can not live without you. I've been a fool. I hope you can forgive me. You were right. We two belong together really. ... What Tilde? Her I'll never to see again. It was a huge mistake and I admit deep. You're the only woman for me. ... Why do you say suddenly it? That's the truth. Have not you always said that we should be together? Yes. ... And we two are right for each other. I had just completely forgotten, how beautiful and wonderful you are. I really love you. I've always done. Will not you take me back, Ida? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Ida. This is a natural reaction to think that it has come back. Yes, but I have a bad sensation. I felt a knot. I can not feel any node. But it may be, you're right. Your prognosis is not overwhelming. I will not give you false hope, but I can no mark. If I were to send all through a large study... So the system would collapse. I think we should wait as long as we talk about psychological symptoms. Knots're not psychic? ... But I can not see any. If you knew what people came running with. We had one last week that could mark a squirrel in his head. I would very, very much like A study. Should we not shove it up? Otherwise it gets a little John Lennon... like. Ida, will you get a cup of coffee? ... Yes, of course. Hey. Hey. Well. Is it here you've gone Og saved you? It is Patrick's father. ... Thee I have heard a lot about. What do you want? I just want to cut. I need to get trimmed sides. We have shown no time in days. Of course we do. It's just a trim. Now talk properly to customers. Yes... How did Patrick it? ... He's feeling much better. And Astrid? ... She needs to travel with Kenneth. I've decided to go back to Italy. Cutting down on work and just. It sounds like a good idea. I know you think I'm an idiot... And this is very strange. Would you like to visit me? Why would I do that? Because I have thought of you, Ever since we took away. You must turn around, so I can cut you. Think about it... No. Why not?... I just can not. You can get anyone. ... I do not want anyone. I want you. Ida, I must not say. ... No, shut up, Vibe. You will not be together with someone like me. Everything can happen. You can not just walk into and invite people to Italy. Moreover, Leif moved back home. It is he hopefully not. ... Yes, it is he. And I love Leif. And I do not want more clutter in my life. Be sweet to go. Sorry. It did not mean to make you sad. Now go ahead. He's only been trimmed on one side. Now you need to keep your mouth shut, otherwise you will be trimmed in the other. Well, thanks for the food. I have a fucking good idea. We take a supplementary... And then we go and journey '. Not? Yes... The Seychelles. It's good enough expensive, but there is fucking beautiful. Hello! Is there something wrong? ... Yes. I do not want to. Good. So we use the damn money on something else. Well I I do not want anything with you. However, as use the money on yourself. Leif, we should not be together any more. It's over. I do not want to... Having to sit in a conservatory and drinking coffee when we grow old. I now, Leif. Where are you going? Ida, I'm talking to you. Where are you going? Ida? How are you going to go? Goodbye. Ida? Ida, dammit! Ida. What are you doing here? ... I came to find you. I'm right here. I will ask you a favour. I have received a letter from the hospital. I do not know what steel: I dare not open it alone. It sounds probably silly... But I dare, if you do it with me. Should I open it? Do you? Regardless of what it says... You should know that I am happy that you have come. Just the fact that we all have met each other, is worth rejoice. I do, anyway. And it will please me, just as long I have the pleasure of your company... Be it in ten minutes... Or two years or thirty. Do you mind, I kiss you first? No.
