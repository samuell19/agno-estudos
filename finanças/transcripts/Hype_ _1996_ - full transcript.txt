It is, for better or worse... Seattle-based bands have topped the world charts for the past few years. Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden have sold millions of records. ...releases to a major label debut... ...musical movements centered around Seattle in a sound and style that became known as grunge. A month before that album came out, they were... ...the basis of the generation of... X societies. How does the grunge movement, as I understand it, is the fact that these kids have the ability to say anything they want to say, express anything they want to express, any anger, any pain, any anguish, any torment, and they feel a kinship, a oneness, that this young man has been through, tragedy...

So, the way they get rid of it is they got these big water sprinklers and they just like run sprinklers over it to pop them... But a bubble still gets out once in a while. They're huge, they're like... Like bubble of death. I went to Bothell High School which was a suburban hell-hole. Um, there's a sign as you enter town that says, 'Welcome to Bothell for a day or a lifetime' and someone... Someone, I wish I had done it, but someone erased the B-O-T at one time so it was 'Welcome to hell for a day or a lifetime'. The Northwest is where flying saucers, the term "flying saucers" was coined. And the Northwest is where Louie Louie's from, the Northwest is where... it's the serial killer capital of the world. I mean, we have more unsolved serial killings up here than any other place in the United States. I mean, the Manson family used to vacation up this way. This place is weird. A lot of occult stuff. All this stuff is a factor in what happened in the music. I mean, when the weather's crappy, you don't wanna go outside. You know, you basically feel like staying in the house and, uh... it's a very logical thing to wanna go down into your basement and, you know, make noise to take out your frustrations because you can't go outside and do anything when it's raining all the time. ♪ Don't get off the bus ♪ ♪ Cause there ain't Nothing for you here ♪ ♪ Singin' my hometown... ♪ Is Seattle a nice place to live?

It has all the amenities of a big city, but... you know, there's nothing you're missing out on by being in Seattle as opposed to another city. And it's pretty, you know, there's hills and mountains and trees and water. So, all these people come here and then there's all this publicity and Northern Exposure and Twin Peaks and all this stuff and everyone wants to come up here and live the good yuppie lifestyle but all the time there's all these people that are underneath that were here first and they're just starving and they're all crazy. I mean, it's like one of those end of the world places you can't go no further and still be in the US. In 1980... I think bands stopped coming to Seattle. Bands never used to come here. They'd go as far as San Francisco and then not... not come all the way up to Seattle because it wasn't worth it to play one show. There were two, maybe two and a half clubs where you could play if you were playing your own music. Some people used to rent halls, just put their whole show on themselves, take tickets, run up do the music and at the end pick up the broom and clean it up. ♪ Let me call you about it ♪ ♪ Woke up this morning... ♪ Well, Seattle was really lame, you know, specifically, in the early '80s, I mean, Seattle was like a million second cities. It had a fake Talking Heads, it had a fake Pere Ubu, it had a fake Killing Joke, it had all the fake Ramones you could shake a stick at, you know, and people from Bellevue singing with English accents. There was this big poodle metal scene. Bands with, um, big fancy guitars and... just tons and tons of hairspray, eyeliner... See, all the extra sleazy punk rockers used to hang out on First Avenue. There was a donut shop right there which was right next to The Showbox which is right there. It's a comedy club now. And that was like the big punk rock venue. Opening night, the very first punk club in Seattle. This is probably worth, you know, three, four hundred bucks. Nobody was too worried about success because we knew we were living in Seattle, you know, it wasn't LA, nobody was gonna come and sign us... You played a show in some small club... the audience consisted of members of the other dozen or so bands that were playing similar bills and similar clubs... The bands that stuck it out did it because they really, really, really enjoyed playing their music and that was really the only positive reinforcement that anybody got. We really started playing music cause it's fun which probably most people say but with us, it's true. - Yeah, everybody else is lying. - Everybody else is lying. ♪ After all the Trouble's come and gone ♪ ♪ It was here for so long ♪ ♪ Now I've got This sinking feeling ♪ ♪ Everyone seems to be leaving ♪ ♪ Oh, whoa, oh ♪ ♪ And I can't believe how Lonely it is here on K Street ♪ ♪ There's no one like me Here on K Street ♪ ♪ How lonely it is Here on K Street today ♪ ♪ Today, today, today ♪ I've never been in any other spot in the country where so many people played, you know?

He missed a note there." Best bands in Seattle were like Malfunction, The U-Men, who else? Skin Yard, My High, Feast, 64 Spiders, Bundle of Hiss... Nobody ever remembers Psycho Pop, man. We could make a long list if you wanna talk about all Tom's bands. We were a good band, man. We had a band called The Fartz. Red Dress, Blackouts... The Blackouts were an excellent band, you know, Free Swimmers, Beakers, Little Bears from Bangkok, Max Band, Quack Quack Quack. Nobody knows these names, this is ancient history! One generation out from a band is every band that shared a member directly with that band. For instance, you know Stone Gossard was in Green River and then he went to Mother Love Bone, like that's one generation out. So, for instance, you could take like an early band like The Blunt Objects and it asks you how many generations. Let's go four generations out. Um, so you sort of have these three columns; the mainstream, heavy metal, hard rock thing that, you know, Mother Love Bone and Pearl Jam have done. Then there's the Fast Backs, the Posies and, uh, The Young Fresh Fellows, which were probably the first band to really make it out of Seattle all by themselves without moving out of town. And they were just, you know, sort of a pop sound. And then the third branch is the noise/grunge rock. That was closely related to Green River and Mudhoney and The Thrown Ups, all sort of Sub Pop, you know, grunge sound and it's pretty incestuous but you keep bumping into the same old people. Green River. This was the genesis right here, Steve and Mark from Mudhoney and Stone and Jeff from Pearl Jam and Alex who's now studying to be a lawyer. Room Nine became Love Battery, Bundle of Hiss became TAD, Pure Joy became Flop, Skin Yard, among other things, became, uh, Gruntruck, Jesse Bernstein who's dead. Watch folks, hundreds of dollars. Don was in Butt Sweat and, uh, they played at one skate contest. And you were too, Tom, don't leave that out. And,uh". And he was also in the Kings of Rock... so was Jim Tillman from... ex of Love Battery What? Jim Tillman wasn't in Butt Sweat? He played rhythm guitar. - Did he? - Yeah. Oh. Remember friends, this is only a movie, you're free to leave the theater at any time. Someone said to me once that there was the aesthetic of dumb about the Seattle music scene that the music wasn't stupid but it was dumb, you know, Mudhoney's not stupid but they're a little bit dumb. My mom has always told me that I'm not a loser, so the whole loser thing, I never believed in 'cause clearly, I'm not a loser and Mark, I think your mom has told you the same thing? We're not losers. I guess it's really easy to think of yourself as a loser 'cause then you don't care if people like you or not. You know, that's sort of the idea, and then you can do whatever you want. And it's funny. We were the guy in high school who people used to beat up. And we couldn't even talk to the pretty girl. I mean, we couldn't... we're nerds, goddammit! Well, I think ever since Spinal Tap came out, I mean, they were like pointing the finger at bloated, overly commercialized, deluded bands, and, uh, we just looked at ourselves, said well we don't have to point at somebody else, we can... When you've been through periods where you've had keyboard players with 50,000 pounds worth of kit onstage and 82 keyboards and 95 samplers you know, uh, after a while you just go, "Hang on, this is like eating too much food at one sitting, it's too much sounds, it's too many colors, it's... it's all got poncy and posy, um, let's go and see some bands where they just bash it out." ♪ Eat my dump ♪ ♪ Tell me that you love me ♪ ♪ Eat my dump ♪ ♪ Help me smell my pie ♪ Some bands get on stage and they're, they're basically entertainers, they have, you know, they have a shtick, they are giving you a show. Some bands get up there and they rock, and you can tell the difference. That's why Seattle bands tend to be a little bit inconsistent live, I think, is because most of them aren't really up there to be entertainers, they're up there to rock out, And their best shows are when they're having the most fun. Not when they necessarily have their act down because maybe they don't have an act. If it's connecting with the audience right, I get chills. - I mean, I can just, - Yeah. I finish a song and it feels right and I can just tell it's just gonna start going fine, man, I get chills and they're rocking and fuck yeah, let's go! There's a million people out there that can do what I'm doing as far as producing, recording, anything like that, a lot better than I'm doing, have better equipment, but still, it's like the only way you get good at anything is to be doing it all the time, so, this is a lifetime chore for me. Basically, it's just to have complete control over everything, to be able to do it the way you want to do it, have it come out the right way and then not really have anybody that can tell you... what the hell to do. Where you can play, how you can look, how you can dress, what songs to record, which ones not to. It keeps it on a personal level, it keeps it where rock and roll type things really should be. It's very much just happening right there, it's not happening in somebody's big offices or in somebody's big bank accounts or anything. It's... it's really exciting for the people that are doing it. ♪ Some say to just forget her ♪ ♪ It'll worry you well If you let it ♪ ♪ Make every day pathetic ♪ ♪ You're in need of a cure And she is one I ♪ You'll survive a vegetable ♪ ♪ The meat's diseased And she said so ♪ ♪ I won't try To persuade you anymore ♪ ♪ Along time ago ♪ ♪ I went and lost my way ♪ FAVE PopLlama was a big influence, Conrad can do it, so Sub Pop can do it. We wanted to do our own record so we will, hell! If these guys can do it, we've seen these guys so drunk they can't stand up, you know. They can't drive a car, so, and they can do this, so we can do that. That's just a given. I think with people here they don't sit around going, "Oh, nothing ever happens here. Nothing ever goes on here." You know, by the time the kid's out of high school, he's already been in a band, put out a couple fanzines, recorded a few records, started a label, did a radio show. That was the whole lesson we learned when we moved up here. Like, you just do it. We moved up here and we saw other bands, you know, no different than us just putting out records. All you really need to do that is some magnetic tape and a microphone, and that's really all you need, and then, you know, maybe, just maybe, some bad reverb. And they smell good, records just smell good. They, you know, there's nothing like cracking that cellophane and pulling that record out, it just smells great. When Deep Six first came out, it was chronicling something that was suddenly going on, I guess it was by a fluke of providence, kind of... a initial document of what later turned into be a pretty big scene. I think we all became aware that there was a certain regional sound developing and nobody had a name for it. That's punk rock and... one day they just sort of started going, um... and that was grunge. The most noisy, The most absurd, The heaviest thing that was going. Yeah, we know this is heavy rock and heavy rock is kind of stupid but it's fun anyways. It's where you had a band like The Melvins doing Kiss covers. It was all in fun, it was like we know that this is the cheesiest thing we could possibly do, we gotta do it. It's just ridiculousness, complete ridiculousness. What can we get away with next, you know. Bands like Green River, basically, they were sort of the definitive grunge band. It was a euphemism for just extremes, extremes of anything, and a lot of people say that it's a throwback to metal. Heavy metal's part of it, it was one influence, punk rock was one influence, basically anything loud and crushing and extreme was an influence. We'd all been in bands that were more controlled and more dynamic, you know, more... better, better bands actually and we just, well, our whole thing was we just wanted to get away from all structure and just be chaotic and not worry about that. It was kind of joyful release. It's taken rock right back to its basics which is go up there and make a hell of a noise and make sure you play music that your parents don't like. First thing, actually, was when we were doing the first Soundgarden single, and we were doing a song called "Nothing To Say," which was just... at the time just seemed amazingly heavy. I thought this, you know, these guys can't possibly be really playing this song, this sounds like, you know, this sounds insane, it sounds way too good for 8-track and it sounds way too good for a, you know, crappy little Seattle band. Bruce Pavitt originally had the name Sub Pop when he was living in Olympia, I think. He had a sort of cassette fanzine network where he put out these little compilation cassettes of local bands. He was interested in making it a vinyl mix. The bands he was interested in at the time were Green River and us. And John, also, was a huge fan of ours. He wanted to make a record, start a record label, so we kinda talked him into working together to put out our record. Up to that time, everyone played it really safe, of all the small labels, "Well, we'll put out a single every three months and, you know, we'll sell a thousand copies of it and that's cool because I've got my day job," and John and Bruce were having none of that, they said, you know, we don't want to work day jobs, we don't want our bands to work day jobs, we want them out there on the road, we want them in the big magazines, we want their records everywhere. It is punk rock, but we don't care. We want to make it bigger than punk rock and that's why these two gentlemen are... the Kings of the scene, as you might say. There was a real Indie ethic in the 80s that you weren't supposed to be proud of having hit records or being a hit machine. And John and I, as fans of, you know, the history of pop music in this... this, uh, this country, really admired labels like Motown and their hit factory... - Mentality. - Yeah. They definitely picked a certain kind of band for their label, which makes everybody think that's the only thing that was the only thing that was going on in Seattle. Um, they... by default, I ended up engineering all of them and... they had Charles doing all the photography. So there was definitely a package an image and a sound. I think every community has their pools of talent it's just a matter of being able to take on the responsibility of marketing. You know, I'm a failed pop musician myself, so... you know, I kinda decided, "Well, I'm gonna play in crummy band after crummy band, I may as well wrap some of these bands who might have a chance at doing something. Basically he said, "Hey, you sing about dogs, you sing about being sick, you got a shtick, it'll take you to the top." And he basically gave us like five chords but he said, "Don't use more than three within one song." ♪ I feel bad ♪ ♪ And I've felt worse ♪ ♪ I'm a creep, yeah ♪ ♪ I'm a jerk ♪ ♪ Touch me, I'm sick ♪ ♪ I won't live long ♪ ♪ And I'm full of rot ♪ ♪ Gonna give you girl Everything I got ♪ ♪ Touch me I'm sick ♪ ♪ Touch me I'm sick ♪ When Sub Pop finally got their act together and they started somehow getting this underground hype thing going which started very small. They flew an English journalist into Seattle, took him to see a Mudhoney show and gave him some singles and had him meet everybody and he went back and wrote a big article in one of the English music papers and that sort of started this big frenzy in England. It just seemed like it was a worthwhile business move, - so we... - Yeah. And fortunately, Everett was a brilliant enough guy that he could piece together a story that essentially sold the world on Seattle. ♪ Love me I'm rich ♪ ♪ Come on baby Now come with me ♪ ♪ If you don't come If you don't come ♪ ♪ If you don't come You'll die alone ♪ Sub Pop, the hype machine, and we went along with it. It seemed pretty funny at the time. They didn't really hype their bands, they hyped their label, which is a much different thing and a much, a much more original thing... It gave a record this desirability, this perhaps fictional desirability, but, nonetheless, it made the collectors try and get a hold of these things and made people talk about them so, a lot of people talked about Sub Pop and how cool their records were and how cool the packaging and the bands were cool and "Oh, you can't get the record, it's worth a lot of money already. People started looking for the Seattle sound, the same way that D.C., Boston, New York and LA, and all those places had this crazy little identity all of their own. Seattle started getting its own identity and Sub Pop decided to exploit that. ♪ Well alright Yeah, alright ♪ ♪ Saw you lookin' For something simple on beyond ♪ ♪ We are, Yeah, alright ♪ ♪ You wouldn't know it ♪ ♪ If it hit you Right between the eyes ♪ ♪ Yeah, alright ♪ ♪ Gonna lift you up, Gonna bring you down ♪ ♪ Gonna let you walk Through this life alone ♪ ♪ Gonna let you Follow your own dream ♪ ♪ It'll turn your head around ♪ J" For the first time In your life you might find ♪ ♪ For the second time In a year ♪ ♪ I don't mind ♪ ♪ For the last time I think it's time to fly ♪ ♪ Freedom's Right between the eyes ♪ Suddenly there were three times as many people that had been here all along, going out, seeing bands and supporting those bands and allowing this scene to be far more viable. What you actually see happening in Seattle is this kind of explosion of sub culture. I think it's a very important thing and a very healthy thing to have happen anywhere, particularly in a place like Seattle, it's so conservative and so reserved to have something like this happen here's been nothing short of, like, major electrical shock. Everything was suddenly just buzzing with activity. I mean, singles were being put out, but there was no point earlier in history that you could have a magazine devote an entire record review section just to local record reviews. Um, people from underground fan 'zines across the country were already starting to snipe about Seattle and how much hype it was receiving. When things started to become spotlighted, more venues opened up and more opportunities opened up for people to play but there was never a lack of great musical talent and it was always really diverse and there was always an unspoken sense of community about it. ♪ I'm so happy ♪ ♪ It's sunny outside ♪ ♪ I'm so happy ♪ ♪ It's snowing today ♪ ♪ I'm so ♪ ♪ I'm so happy ♪ ♪ The world's gonna explode ♪ They won't let us in 'cause we're not 18.

I was in London in the 1960s, I was in London in the 1960s, it was awful! I mean... If you say the word 'scene' everybody rolls their eyes and laughs at you. "Scene." you know, "there's no scene!" So, a lot of people thought that it has reached its peak and by next year, we are all gonna go back to doing what we were doing and we are all gonna go back to our little small town Utopia and, uh, about 1990 we all sort of went, "Oh, good, it's over." Nirvana kinda came out of left field, uh, namely Aberdeen, which is a town sort of out in the middle of nowhere. And, uh, you know, we just got a phone call at the studio one day from this guy, you know, Kurt, says his name was Kurt, he said he was a friend of the Melvins and he wanted to come up and just record some songs and I said okay, friend of the Melvins, friend of mine, come on up. You know, I didn't know who the hell he was and nobody else did either. He just came up, blew out ten songs in five hours, we recorded them and mixed them in one afternoon and, uh, blew me away. I thought "Oh, my God, this is amazing," you know? I said, "Guys, can I please keep a copy of this for myself before you go back to Aberdeen? That was the tape I gave to Jonathan. This is my penultimate grunge photo... Kurt Cobain spinning on his back. Everyone asks "How in the hell is he doing that?"

I think that Screaming Trees had put out their first major label record and I think it was doing okay. Alice in Chains was... had put out their first major label record, it was doing okay. But, Nirvana was kind of the little brother, you know, the runt of the litter, so to speak. And I remember Jonathan telling me in 1990, he said, "This band is going to be huge." He said it exactly like that, he said, "Jack, this band is going to be huge." The record came out in fall, September. The video came... I remember the first time I saw the video, I thought "This is so cool," that there's no way MTV will play this, just no way. And then when that started going it reached millions of kids instantly. Ben would go off and call up people back home in Seattle, he'd come back and say, you know, the latest sales figures. He'd go, "Nevermind has done 300,000." "Nevermind has done 400,000." "Nevermind just went gold." ♪...hello, hello ♪ ♪ With the lights out ♪ ♪ It's less dangerous ♪ ♪ Here we are now ♪ ♪ Entertain us ♪ ♪ I feel stupid ♪ ♪ And contagious ♪ ♪ Here we are now, Entertain us ♪ ♪ A denial, a denial ♪ ♪ A denial, a denial ♪ ♪ A denial ♪ There was an old, uh, Brain song called "Money Changes Everything"...

But again, commerce is involved and as soon as it starts going through those channels those money-making channels, everything changes, you know? When these bands started to get popular, all of a sudden everyone wanted to find the next Nirvana, everyone wanted to sign the next Pearl Jam. All of a sudden, bands who'd never played live before, practically, were getting huge advances. The labels start bidding for bands to get bands signed, so that they could then sell them to a major, the bands get all worked up and basically break verbal contracts you make with them because, well, you don't have a contract. I mean, when I first started I didn't need contracts, I didn't think I did, you know? "Here's my friend", you know, but someone throws, you know, 500,000 in their face and they're like, "Oh, we didn't have a contract." If the major labels are like a big, dumb Baby Huey, you know, that "Oh, what's going on in Athens?" And waddle over to Athens and you sit down on Athens and you start buying lunches and you crush three bands by accident and, you know, "Wow, the party's in Athens, you know? And then you kinda look over your shoulder and go, "Oh... Minneapolis and then Baby Huey gets up and goes and sits on Minneapolis and kills three bands by accident and buys a bunch of lunches and, you know, kind of plays that party out and then, you know, so, the idea that they were moving in, you know, sort of dedicated clumps, I mean Seattle was just like part of that process. ♪ Say good bye To your friends and family ♪ ♪ Welcome to the menagerie ♪ ♪ Funny how They forget to tell you ♪ ♪ This is all you will ever be ♪ .1' This is all you will Ever be now ♪ ♪ This is all you will ever be ♪ .1' This is all you will Ever be now ♪ ♪ This is all you will ever be ♪ The effect of this whole thing of like hyping a label, or hyping a sound, or hyping a place, is it starts to take a lot of the attention away from the individual artists that are making music. Everyone doesn't sound the same, everyone isn't grunge, everyone doesn't have long hair, you know, um... They made a big mistake. They didn't go further and find more of the bands that were already here and had been here even before the bands that were exploited were, you know? That's what makes me feel guilty of the success of our band because it should've been, uh, spread out to the success of like a number of bands here. They focused on this one scene or one type of music when really that's pretty inaccurate 'cause there's all kinds of bands here, you know? There's, like, weird, funky jazz bands and weird, you know, hip-hop bands, or punk rock bands, or metal bands or whatever, it's like there's a whole bunch of stuff, so... ...and cowpunk bands, there's like a shit load of different bands here, there always has been. In Europe, they just started to put stickers on things that just said "Seattle," that's all the sticker said.

They wanna get wild, yeah. There'll be no shortage of disaffected American youth over the next 50 years. Well, even more. Some great rock and roll coming down the line. There's over a thousand bands in Seattle right now and I think a lot of that is people moving here, bands moving here in hopes of becoming famous... Because of all the hype and attention on Seattle people know that if they do something here they're gonna get recognized to some extent, they won't be totally overlooked, even if it's bad. In fact, there were musicians who moved to California in the early 80s, from Seattle, to try and get signed. Who started moving back. There's got to be at least a thousand, if not more than that in Seattle, and so I came up with an idea to package boxsets of Northwest bands, so what I try and do is I try and find ways to exploit, and I like the word 'exploit', exploit through propaganda and television the Northwest music community as a whole. Volume three is probably my favorite set, it's got... it's got some of the most well-known bands. You got your Hammerbox, and your Hungry Crocodiles, Pond, Sara Debell, Peace, Love and Guitars. It's just got, I mean it's got so many great bands in it, that if you wanna know anything about the Northwest music, there's my card. If you wanna know anything about the Northwest music scene, this is a great place to start because all the cards have the contact information of the band on the back and also, if you take these cards, turn them face down, put them together, it's a jigsaw puzzle of a traffic jam on I5. ♪ I say fuck ♪ ♪ I say fuck and you say yeah ♪ ♪ I say fuck and you say yeah ♪ ♪ I say fuck you say yeah I say fuck you say yeah ♪ ♪ I say fuck, yeah ♪ ♪ Oh, I say let's, And you say go ♪ ♪ I say let's, You say let's go, man ♪ ♪ I say let's and you say go I say let's and you say go ♪ ♪ I say let's go ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ Today I was in a music shop and I saw some people and it was like, "You moved from LA, probably yesterday!"

Rap band in this room. I hear a lone drummer practicing here. Industrial nonsense comes out of that flat. It's all hallways and dark rooms. Bands in the rafters, Bands to the left, bands to the right. If you like being a kid setting up a lemonade stand and have a really successful lemonade stand, and all of a sudden ten of them open up right next to you, in your yard, on your block all competing for the same lemonade nickel. Only they're obviously selling lower quality lemonade. Right now, Seattle is quarter until six on Christmas Eve at a shopping mall when the mall closes at six 0' clock, when it's too crazy and it's loaded with sub-moronic idiots, prancing around, buying anything they can get their hands on. ...by universal acclaim, the nation's media have declared Seattle the coolest place in the known universe. The music of Seattle is as progressive as the people Listen to Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Nirvana. Where else can you get the Seattle sound? Best Buy.

Is it mutant rock and roll? Have we ever used chainsaws and axes? Are they contributing anything to the world they're taking so much from? Mudhoney is sort of like watching the market right now. In October 1993, this group's "VS." album debuted at number one, with sales of 950,000 copies. Jeremy. - Who is Pearl Jam? - Yeah. Pop music for 400. Does this look like we're unhappy or cynical? Okay, our next guests are a Seattle band, this right here is their newest album. - ...playing the Posies - "Weird Al" Yankovic. Pearl Jam! Hey Butt-Head, where's Seattle? - Seattle. - Seattle. Seattle. Thanks, phone dude! I think now is the time that I should be announcing my candidacy for mayor of Seattle. When the whole thing was just out of control and press people were visiting our office at the rate of two or three a week, it seemed like very few of them had even the most remote clue of what was really going on in Seattle. Glossy print ad with a fancy red car and a background and they're saying something about grunge They think people are gonna go out and buy this car? They're gonna look at this ad and go, "Fuck you!" When you're close to something, you feel you know the truth about it and when People Magazine's writing about it you know they're not gonna have the truth, they have a very distorted view of it. And you realize that that's what the entire world sees and that's what the entire world thinks about, and they're wrong. ("Second Skin" by The Gits plays] Maybe there's like a bunch of photographers and they wanna put you with this other person from another band that you don't even know and they want you to put your arm around them and smile and... "You play in band, don't you?" "Yeah, yeah, I play in a band." "Pearl Jam, right?" II No-II "Aren't you the drummer from Pearl Jam?" "No, I'm not the drummer from Pearl Jam." They didn't even say anything about the music. They talked about what we wore and whether or not the girl in the band before shaved her armpits or not. The newest thing I heard was that we're really bad at interviews.

They were all the same. What's Seattle like? What are the bands like? Do you know this band? Do you know that band? Everyone had it. We put a moratorium at one point on people calling and asking for the Seattle story. There was nothing to do except just start poking fun at the entire thing and so, instead of saying, "No, I really don't know that person", it would turn into, "Oh, sure, every Monday morning we eat banana splits at breakfast time," "Shoo-be-doo used to be my roommate", or, you know, "I'll tell ya, he has a horrible case of the squirts after he has Indian food." And, like, you just start making up every single lie you can and then try to... the goal is to just get crazy rumors circulating all the time. There's a big element of put on involved with all Seattle music, I mean, Kurt Cobain's goofy name spelling's, uh, a lot of Sub Pop's world domination kind of attitude, I mean, the whole thing's ridiculous. Seventy-five percent of what Bruce and Jon say is a lie. Um, but it serves them well. It's essentially been one big prank. We've always pretended we were something we weren't, now that we're huge and have a lot of money, we're trying to pretend that we're small and Indie and have street cred. That's one of the great things about a lot of the bands here that, you know, great humor, you know? It's why I'm obviously not from here. One of my favorite hoaxes was the lexicon of grunge. The New York Times called Sub Pop records and talked to a woman there who just started making up words, they were trying to find out what the inside secret dope was. "What was the, uh, the hip language?" ...and I was like, "Uh, why don't you give me a word and I'll give you the grunge slang for it?" She just started making stuff up. A lot of it was kind of stuff that she used for herself, just for laughs, and next thing you know, it's on the cover of the New York Times and everybody around here was just giggling and snorting...

I am basically... a trendsetter in the fashion scene and Rolling Stone called and they were doing a fashion spread on "What the Indies are wearing". I had to tell them that, uh, I didn't think they'd be interested in me but that we had a fella here, Scott McCaughey from The Young Fresh Fellows, who probably was just what they were looking for, so, uh, they came and they interviewed Scott briefly, and then got out this pile of clothes and made him, like, take off his Converse and put on their tennis shoes, and take off his flannel shirt, wear their flannel shirt. And then put, you know, in the caption below: "Flannel shirt 85 dollars." Who didn't get a flannel shirt for Christmas from their relatives? And you tie it around your waist and you run off and do a stage dive, all across America. But up here, because it's logger territory, all these goon balls just wear flannel anyways and then that's what became the stereotype here. I mean, you go around, you know, cities everywhere you see some real stereotypical grungies, you know, the Pearl Jam shirt, you know, with the stocking cap and the... you know, the really long johns with the shorts and then, and you just say "I spit on you!" Mannequins in stores with, like, long johns and shorts for like 300 bucks and... - It's like... - We got them fooled. We wear long johns up here because it's fucking cold. When Seventh Avenue decided that grunge-wear was something they put on the runways and that they thought it would be an absolute knock-over. Yes, that any of my clients would be in their fashion shows and be in their fashion layouts and when Vanity Fair did a spread with people like Joan Rivers wearing grunge-wear... that was the only moment for me, so far, That came close to unbearable. It was our thing and then all of a sudden belonged to people who... You never thought you were sharing your music with. Like mainstream periodicals and fashion magazines and I started realizing "Well, there's a whole lot of people out there making money by selling the idea of the Seattle scene or grunge or whatever. It's so profitable. It's so profitable, and they'll just keep taking and taking and taking and they're... they just don't know how to restrain themselves, you know, they're frothing at the mouth over this. And the bands aren't, I mean, the bands aren't really in it for dough, I mean, they just aren't. That would, if they were, that would... That would tip over the music. It's like it already, it's obvious to see the Seattle scene has become a marketed commodity. ...but that's what makes pop culture so significant to all the little consumers out there. They have no interest in history or economics or science or art. They're kinda interested more in gossip, the nature of celebrity and that's not at all encouraging to find out that... You participate in that society.

That really pisses me off. Well, I liked them first! When you hear a song that's a great song, played a million times, you never want to hear it again. "If I hear that song one more time..." "If I see that guy's face one more time..." I wanna fuckin' find out his address and kill that motherfucker." I don't blame 'em. I've said it myself. There definitely is the idea that success is bad and that's part of the rebellion, that's part of the rebellion against... against the '80s, you know, um, our peers and our parents, that didn't really wanna become successful because with that comes the trappings of responsibility. Its seemed for a while that, like, that "celebrity" was not really what you wanted once you got it and yet, you look at any of these people, that are now complaining about being too much in the spotlight or always, you know, scrutinized by everyone. What did you expect, you know? I think a lot of people whine about it but secretly they kind of are excited about it too. I don't think that people ever can imagine what is gonna go along with being popular, I mean, I don't think no matter what somebody tells you, it's gonna be like, I think it's a lot different once you get there. I think so too, maybe we should try to find out. ♪ Painted blue across my eyes ♪ ♪ And tie the linen on ♪ ♪ And I'm on my way ♪ ♪ Looking for the paradigm So I can pass it off J" ♪ Is it on my side ♪ ♪ Is it to the sky ♪ ♪ Is to the sky ♪ ♪ Painted blue across my eyes And tie the linen on ♪ ♪ And I'm on my way ♪ ♪ On my way a' ♪ Looking for the paradigm So I can pass it off J" ♪ Is it on my side ♪ ♪ On my side ♪ ♪ Is it to the sky ♪ ♪ To the sky ♪ ♪ Is it to the sky ♪ ♪ And down ♪ ♪ Searching for the ground ♪ ♪ With my good eye closed ♪ I kinda figured you play guitar or drums or whatever, say, make a record, play a show, if people like your record, they like your show.

You start wondering if success is really a good thing because it, it sort of makes people psycho. It's nothing to strive for. It's actually like... this kind of success or trying to fulfill this kind of hype, it can destroy everything. It can destroy what's real, which is like music to you, or what's real, which is your life, you know, it can destroy it... You know, it can make it a commodity. At who's cost? At yours.

Well imagine, you're a band, you're making music for fun... because you like writing your own songs, you like playing your own songs, you like playing to your friends and having them clap and, you know, having a good time, and getting up and jumping around on stage and, you know, crashing into people, and um, suddenly, every publication and all the media in the world wants to get at you, suddenly, people everywhere you go recognize you, they want your autograph, suddenly your life as a private individual is over with. And that's probably a pretty heavy thing to deal with. What it looks like is, wow, if you wanna be really successful, do heroin but what I see is, I saw people who were making really good music, suddenly have like this overwhelming need for money. It's fucking heartbreaking to see how disillusioned... People get to where they... that escape is so... sought after. I think the first hint of it was when Andy Wood died. We started thinking, "This is really sad because this guy had a great future in front of him, he was a really wonderful guy, funniest guy. The only rock and roll stand-up comic in Seattle was Andy Wood, and, uh... we thought, man, you know, they haven't even become stars yet, and already he's a casualty. Kurt, on New Year's Day, '93. Um, this was the shoot for the cover of The Advocate and, uh, I really like this photo of Kurt, we were just, we were just talking and... and I was just picking the camera up occasionally and photographing him. It's rare to see a picture where he's, he's emoting or doing something with his hands other than in his pocket and I really like this one. Symbolically, perhaps, it represented the death of something. I mean, I know when, I was... it affected me in such a way that I was seriously tempted to give up everything and go be a farmer or something. It was just, it was so disillusioning to me. It was hard, I didn't take it well. If all this influence that this part of the country has and this musical scene has, if it doesn't do anything with it, that would be the tragedy. If it doesn't do something with it like make some kind of change and make some kind of difference, this group of people who feels this certain way this group of people who, like, thinks these things that the underdogs we've all met and lived with think... if they'd finally get to the forefront and nothing comes of it, that would be the tragedy. ♪ Restless soul ♪ ♪ Enjoy your youth ♪ ♪ Like Muhammad ♪ ♪ Hits the truth ♪ ♪ Can't escape from ♪ ♪ The common rule ♪ ♪ If you hate something ♪ ♪ Don't you do it too ♪ ♪ Too ♪ ♪ This is not for you ♪ ♪ This is not for you ♪ ♪ This is not for you ♪ ♪ Oh, never was for you ♪ ♪ You ♪ To actually be this close to a pop culture explosion has been really fascinating. I mean also, when you can understand what happened in San Francisco in '66 and '67, you can understand what happened in England during the punk thing and in during the Mersey Beat era and the subsequent stuff that happened in London, I mean, all of a sudden, you can see how ridiculous the whole God damn thing is, I mean, it's utterly absurd, I mean... It's so funny that they call it the Seattle scene, because it all grew out of the region. Everybody doing what they love because they love it. It doesn't matter if they're from Bellingham, Portland, Olympia, you have people who are in bands because they want to be in bands, who started record labels cause they like their friends' bands and they want to put out a rack of fanzines because no one was covering the kind of music that they heard and all this was allowed to grow without any other force coming in and disturbing that. ♪ All that's sacred ♪ ♪ Comes from you ♪ ♪ Dedications naive and true ♪ ♪ With no power ♪ ♪ Nothing to do ♪ ♪ I still remember ♪ ♪ Why don't you? ♪ ♪ Don't you ♪ ♪ This is not for you ♪ ♪ This is not for you ♪ ♪ This is not for you ♪ ♪ Oh, never was for you ♪ ♪ Fuck you ♪ ♪ This is not for you ♪ ♪ Oh, never was for you ♪ ♪ You ♪ I didn't think I would be making a living at doing this. I mean, I had no idea that these bands were going to become so, so popular, so famous. I would have taken a lot more photographs of them if I'd have known. Our first year's tour was a total failure, you know, we didn't make more than 90 bucks at any show in the whole US. And I'm just like, they hated us everywhere we went. We're doing basically the same thing we were doing in '85 and now people like us. I don't know why. Let me put things in perspective for you. Five years ago, this was a sleepy little coastal fishing village, now, could we have the camera pan out to the skyline here, this kind of economic development is directly related to what Jon and I have done to promote Seattle. That's what's become of the great punk rock party house of the mid '80s. It's so harsh. It used to be this tiny little shack, like, set way back and these terrible, like, big weeds in the middle of this, these beautiful homes. And now look, it is a beautiful home. I would love to, in about 20 years from now, be playing in, like, uh, some kind of super-lounge-y soul band with a horn section or something like that, you know? Yeah, probably all be playing in R&B bands in Pioneer Square. Probably the same... Probably the same R&B band on Pioneer Square. ♪ This is the... ♪ Wow, what did I do right in a past life, or whatever, that I get to do this with my three really good friends? I get to be in a band, and make music with these people, it's a really incredible experience. We just play music when we can and do shows and record them. We have songs... Every now and then we find out Seattle got really famous. And we didn't It's not too bad, it's okay. What was the question?
