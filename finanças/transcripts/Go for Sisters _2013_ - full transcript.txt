You do things for your friends, you got their backs when they're in trouble, or else what's the friggin' point? Excuse my language, but you know what I mean. 'Cause Kevin and I, we've been tight, like forever. He's like a brother to me, you know, it's just these boys now, they don't grow up. So he calls me, and he's all like, "I'm gonna kill myself, and boohoo, Shelley dumped me, I'm no good," and I'm like, take a friggin' valium. But there's only so much you can do over the phone, so I can kinda tell by his voice that he's fucked up again, and trust me you don't want this guy gettin' behind the wheel drivin' over to my place. So I'm tellin' him, don't do anything drastic until I get there, and then I go over. What this punk didn't tell me is that he was calling me from the balcony of his apartment while this party's going on. And I walk through the door, it's like these friggin' characters. I mean, the second I walk through that door, I'm like, "Katrina, this is no good." But then they tell me that he's holed up in the bathroom, so I go in, you know? I know the rules, I didn't see nothin'. Like out on the table, no paraphernalia that I recognized. There was loud music and low-lives layin' around all over the place. And trust me, Kevin didn't tell me the part where Shelley dumped him because he's dealing crank again. She can't take it. If I would've gotten there five minutes earlier, I would've said my piece, and I would've been gone. And if I would've gotten there five minutes later, I would've seen the squad cars, and I woulda kept on drivin'. You know? You're not gonna really write me up for five minutes, are you? You violated your parole. -I know, but I wasn't... -On the premises with a convicted felon, controlled substances. I wasn't doing anything. Your hearing will be at 11 o'clock on Wednesday. Don't be late. I've been clean, I've been sober. I've been like a friggin' nun. Well, you let them know that at your hearing. Ugh. You will hear about five or six of those a day. She reminds me of this girl who moved into my mother's neighborhood. Like, right off there's this parade of nasty-looking boyfriends. 'Scuse me. Hello. Yeah, just for a minute. Was he there? What about the truck? Okay, let's keep trying. Excuse me. Now my mother is afraid to leave her apartment. There's a balance you have to find. Guiding your clients towards rehabilitation, but always keeping in mind the welfare of the public. The non-criminals. Yeah, I'll take the next one. Re-assignment, Fontayne Scott. Scott! They told me Delmarco's gone. Your supervisor retired, I'll be taking over your case. You have a drip. You are Fontayne Scott. Maiden name Gamble. Well, that's all I got. Come with me. Cindy, take this sample downstairs, then go to Caplan's and get us some lunch. We're eating in? Um, ham and cheese on sourdough, Russian dressing, no pickle. I'll eat your pickle. Yeah, okay fine, and Dr. Brown's Cream soda. Got it. Take a seat. -So, Bernice. -Past acquaintance between officer and client is prohibited, so after today, you'll have to be re-assigned. But for now, you violated your parole. Marvela come into the diner, I hadn't seen her in some time, we gots to talkin', she offered to carry me home on the ride, that's all. Marvela who has two warrants for her arrest. -I didn't know that. -Marvela who was driving without a valid driver's license. A friend offer you a ride, you don't ask to see no picture I.D. If I was in danger of returning to prison, I wouldn't want to take any chances. I didn't know. You went to two bars before you were picked up. I had club soda. Both bars are known to be venues for narcotics transactions. You see where I live, there ain't nothin' but that. So how you been, Bernice? All right, I guess. Got this job. Yeah. Married? Was. Kids? I had a son, he's a-- he was a soldier in Operation Enduring Freedom. Wow, grown up that much, huh? Mm-hm. How you been? You can read my jacket. It's too long. Look, I fucked up. Marvela, I know she ain't who I'm supposed to be hangin' with, but... ...where I live everybody got some kind of record, everybody likely to be carryin' something they shouldn't be. I got to feel alive sometimes, otherwise what's the point in being out? I can't do no more time, damn it. I already let enough of my life slip by. Must be fun, huh? Sitting here, play God on people. This sorry girl ain't got her shit together, we're gonna have to lock her ass up some more. You can go. I'm not recommending a hearing. My record? I'll write it up so it won't be a problem. Is your sample okay? Nothin' in it but orange juice. They squeeze their own at the diner. Just be more careful in the future. For old time's sake, huh? If you ever need anything... If I can ever do anything for you, anything... Right, like I got anything to do with your world. Thank you, Bernice, for real. Parole Agent Stokes. You kept your married name? Look, it would be better in here if you just-- Parole Agent Stokes then. Hey. Any news on Rodney? You did? What's his? Fuzzy. That's his real name? Address? Sorry that took so long. No problem. Really tricky case. You're a public defender, what could be tricky? This kid might be innocent. At least of the thing he's been accused of. Like I said, innocent. You are a soft touch. Sure. Where do you wanna eat? It doesn't matter, or we could go to your place, and I could throw something together. Listen, Bernice. What? Who is she? Whoa. how'd we get from where do you wanna eat to who is she? I listen to people sugarcoat their bullshit all day, Dez, so. -So do I. -Then we both know where this is going, so. Who is she? My wife. I don't know if that makes me feel better or worse. I never heard one good thing about the woman. -From me. -From you! We got kids. You can see 'em whenever you want to. -We started this-- -Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you read me the warnings. It's not an easy decision to make. It better goddamn not be. Your wife? The things you've told me. The idea is that it'd be different. You okay? No! That's exactly what she would be doing. That's what I'm talkin' bout. Nah, nah, nah, nah. Yo yo, Fontayne, Fontayne, what's up, Mama? Look at you walkin' around on two legs out in the world. C'mon over here, girl. -Hey, Wiley. -Hey, what's up, baby? Come here, hey, you know I got what you need, right? Come on over here. No, no, not tonight. Come on over here, baby. Let me talk to you, let me talk to you a sec. Rodney, it's your mother. You there, Rodney? I'm worried about you. Just call, you know, I don't--I don't care what... Just call me, okay? Love you. Back up. Move back, folks. That's it, back up. Back up. On this side of the tape. Hey, Vick. -Hey, Bernice. -What's up? Oh, the usual, somebody got in over their head and they got it blown off. I.D.? The late Fuzzy Niles. The only victim? They killed his pitbull, too. What are you doin' here? Oh, a client in the neighborhood. At this hour? Get a life, girl. So, um, what was he into, Fuzzy? Nothing good. Here ya go, babe. Where'd you learn to cook? In County, first visit. I could scramble 50 eggs at a time. You comin' to check up on me? When you get off of work? Four. Somethin's come up. I'll be back then. Oh, it's you. You haven't been to work since last Friday. I've been sick. Oh, symptoms? I have a fever. Hm, well, let's see about that. What's minimum wage nowadays? Eight dollars an hour or some shit like that? You ain't makin' no tips scrapin' that grill. You want somethin'? No, just to see an old friend. I was never friends with with you, Wiley. Customer, associate? It hurts me, it hurts me to see a woman like you in here slavin' away for nothin' like this. You'll survive. You ain't feelin' so good, I can tell. I've felt worse. Yeah, but you've felt a whole lot better before, haven't you? Whole lot better. I'm done with that. Really? Ain't much to look forward to when you get up in the mornin', then, is there? Every day I wake up, I look forward to a day where I don't see you. Now you just hurt my feelings, girl. And I was just gonna ask you to come partner with me again. Same deal we had before, you know, you help me move my product, you get a discount. If you ain't gonna order no food, then you need to move your narrow ass up off a that stool. You ain't feelin' well at all. Snappish. Hey, you know where to find me. She know where to find me. How's that burger? Bernice. Bernice! Detective Mueller. Right, you were the arresting officer-- Naomi Prosser, both times. Is she in trouble? I've moved over to robbery/homicide. Oh. You know a character named Fuzzy Niles? I walked into his wake last night. He's a friend of your son, Rodney. He is? And we'd like to talk to Rodney, but, um, we don't have an address. Well, when you get one, you let me know. My own son is, like, in witness protection. Really? No address, no number that works anymore. You know, Rodney, he's-- he's got his own life now, and apparently I'm not a part of it. He's a suspect. In the murder? You let us know if you hear from him. You know it's the right thing to do. So? I'll do what I can, but some of the people I gotta talk to, that's in violation of my parole. Not--not if you inform your parole officer, and get approval. I'm your parole officer. I thought you was gonna re-assign me. I'm your parole officer. Right. I don't think that landlord believed I'm anybody's aunt. Yeah, well, at least he gave us the key. You ever been in here? He never invited me. Nope. Still doesn't clean his room. You know, that was the big battle. He claimed there was a constitutional right to privacy, and I'd threaten to call the sanitation department. My room don't look much neater. I mean, he got nicer stuff than me, but... He used to love the Clippers when he was little, you know, the basketball team? Had all their posters all over the wall. Kinda loser team most years. At least the tickets were easy to get. You sure you wanna be doing this? Well, if I'm gonna find him, I gotta know him. Better than I do lately, anyway. You know, there used to be a time where I could tell how his day had been by the way he opened up the refrigerator door when he came home from school. It's just a little hash, no big deal. Yes it is. Man, he got all the toys. Yeah, when he was little he had me get him Roadblock. Who that? G.I. Joe's black buddy. And all the machine guns, and whatnot. Did he read comic books back then? I never bought 'em for him, but he had 'em around. All right, let's see if I can get into his messages. I bet this is one of them that can turn everything in the house on. Change the channel, change the temperature. You know, inside the joint they got, like, everybody's old throw-away computers and shit, and no walk-around telephones. When you get out, you're like years behind. Turn it off, Turn it off! Leave the area immediately. Okay. So much for reading his mail. You know, we can't leave this place like this. I ain't doin' no dishes. I mean, in case the police, you know, if it goes that far. Oh, damn, he's growin' some shit in here. He ain't gonna thank you for that. Well, that's just too bad. You know, find a bag, and put the computer in it. I'm gonna go upstairs and check the pockets of his clothes. You know his mail hutch outside? It was all crammed full. I'll find something to jack it open with. Coulda had a life in crime, Bernice. Ain't none of this what I'm supposed to be doing. My parole agreement. It's all right if you're with me. Yeah, that's how I used to figure it back in school, too. Can't be doing nothin' wrong, Bernice is here. Hi, can I speak to detective Mueller? Tell him it's Bernice Stokes. You ain't supposed to talk on the phone while you drive either. Hi, Detective Mueller? Yeah, I, um, I found Rodney's address for you. Yes, I--I stopped by there with a friend, but he wasn't in. Of course I didn't take anything. What would I want of Rodney's? This a new bitch? Hello, Dixon. Look at you, all dyked out and shit. You like pussy, Dixon? You know I do. Well, that's one thing we got in common. -Vernell in? -Vernell don't wanna see you. Well, he gonna have to, sooner or later. All this nice shit going to waste. Damn. It ain't a crime. I'm not saying anything. -When did you? -I started comin' to jail. 'Cause at school that just... Yeah, I was cuttin' up with them boys. -So? -So, boys turn into men, sorta. And men ain't never done me no good. What's the problem, Fontayne? No problem, just need to talk. Oh. This is Bernice. So talk. I'm lookin' for Fuzzy Niles. That boy got popped last night. You ain't into that shit, are you? What shit? The shit that Fuzzy was up to. Who he been hangin' with? So why you wanna know? Cause the mothafucka' owes me money, and not no little bit of it either, so if he's not here, then I mean to get it from his boys. A little Mexican cat by the name of Juan Calles, and some black boy they called the Rod, used to be in the Marines and some shit. Where they hang? Last I heard, they went down to the border. Damn. Yeah. Is Juan your Mexican, Mexican? He's from Oxnard. Fuzzy die natural? What you think? Do you know who did him? I don't know, somebody that got tired of his bullshit, like I'm getting tired of yours. Could've been one of those two buddies of his. The border, huh? Unless they took a million dollars of your money, and you got an army to get it back, I would forget about those boys. Nice meeting you, Bernice. You were married to that guy for three years? It's on my sheet. So what's up with that? Yo wanna keep up with this? Of course! You know what your son been up to? Not really. -He was a marine? -No, no, just infantry. You know, transport unit. He got out, he bought a truck a year ago, and he just started hauling stuff. Stuff. He doesn't talk to me so much once he got out of the service. I--I don't really know what he's been doin'. You really wanna find out? I want him back. Okay, they've been hangin' down on the border, I maybe know somebody in San Diego. I'm gonna need you to sign off if I leave the county. Don't worry about it. -It's almost seven. -What's at seven? I see some familiar faces here today, welcome. Some new faces, welcome. Um, Fontayne, haven't heard from you in a while, why don't you get us started? I'm Fontayne Gamble, and I'm a drug addict. -Hello, Fontayne. -Hello, Fontayne. Fontayne, who's your friend? Um, hi, I'm Bernice Stokes, I'm not an alcoholic or a drug addict or anything, a parole officer. I had her once, she's a real ball-buster. The more you do, the longer you do it, the less "you" there is left, and maybe that's what you want at first. You know, get rid of that person you don't like so much, you just become a habit, a hole that needs fillin', and you desperate, but you wanna be desperate, right? 'Cause that excuses everything, you know, everything you about to do, everything you ever done. When I was in County this last time, waitin' for trial, I couldn't score but once or twice a week, that low-quality shit. Then you just stuck with yourself. Stuck. I don't know, um... I guess I'm not ready to die yet. I've had lots of clients go through the program, and for some of them it really worked. Clients. It's a term they encourage us to use. Hollywood agents have clients. They get 10 percent. Maybe I'm underpaid. Bernice, you don't want no part of my life. Yo. Yo! We're lookin' for Juan Calles. We look anything like cops? That's been nailed shut. Well, you can't beat the rent, right? Look, I don't care if I am with you, I ain't breakin' in here. I'm gonna check around back and call you if it's open. Whatever-- playin' Buffy the fuckin' Vampire Slayer here. Fontayne! It's open! Doubtin' anybody live here. What the fuck you doin' here? -Juan Calles? -What about him? Nothin', I'm looking for him, and my son. -What about your son? -Rodney. -Rodney Stokes. -Freeze, little man. I'm Detective Gamble of the L.A.P.D., and I will blow that mess you got for brains right across this room. Now drop it. Very slowly now, you gon' get up off the lady, and bend yourself over this stove here. Spread your legs wide-- I don't know what you need a razor for, you don't even shave yet. -I ain't done nothin'. -You didn't visit Fuzzy Niles last night? -I don't even know who that is. -Why're you in here? Lookin' for Juan Calles, just like you. Why? I want a lawyer. What's in this? You're gonna tell me what this is. I'm gonna blow your head off, right now. I'm as serious as cancer, little man, tell me. All I know is Calles and the other two fucked up down at the border-- I was supposed to give 'em this, that's all. Who, where they at? T.J., maybe, Mexicali. -How we find him? -You don't, they find you. Some Chinese guy gave me this envelope and sent me here to deliver it. -A Chinese guy? -From the old country. Look, I swear I'd tell you more if I knew it. All right, little man, I'mma cut you a break. If you can disappear before my backup gets here, I won't run you in. Think you can do dat? I'm gone. Stay that way. Where'd you get a gun? I always carry a .45. You goin' to the police with this? And once Willis made detective, I thought, you know, he'd relax a bit. But he put even more hours on the job, came home tight, like if you'd touch him, he'd explode. He okay with your boy? He was kinda like, "Yes, sir, no, sir." But Rodney, he lived to please that man. And you split up. No, he died. Oh. Cerebral hemorrhage. His partner found him sitting behind the wheel in the lot of Rampart Station. His coffee was still warm. So you raised him up yourself, Rodney. I guess. I mean, I wanted him to go to college, but he got that army idea in his head. Yeah, the uniform. You know, he wanted me to sign for him when he turned 17, said he wanted to be a part of something bigger than himself. Of course, I wouldn't. He had to wait six months. Barely got two civil words out of him all that time. He was never in trouble before? With the law? God, no. I'd go 10 miles over the speed limit, he'd be all over me. Hm. I'm trying to remember why we fell out. In high school. Carlos Washington. Nah. You stole my boyfriend. I didn't steal him. He came after me. But you didn't walk away, did you? I was jealous of you. Oh, yeah, right. You had both your parents. When I came over, they'd be so nice, nobody screamin'. I just wanted to stay there forever. We were so tight. People always said we could go for sisters. Your boy ever been married? Engaged. Then he went over and they talked on the computer. She sent him cookies. They broke up a week after he got back. He wasn't angry like his dad, but moody. And I just wanted him to go back to school, you know, get his degree. And he bought that truck. That's the husband. I don't want to step on her thing here. Okay. Chula! Chula. Can we talk? In the park up ahead, can't miss it. How'd you get to be friends? Not friends, we were together inside. It's, you know, its own world in there. Now she got a baby. Who's this? Orfeo. It's Spanish for "Orpheus." Damn. It was Ricky's grandfather's name. Some kind of superhero in Ancient Greece. He went down to Hell after his wife. And before that, saved all the sailors from the sirens. Which is like mermaids? They were beautiful women who would sing. And make you smash up on the rocks. He doesn't know, Ricky. Anything? He knows I was in the Locos. But he doesn't know I did time. You gonna tell him? Maybe. This is Bernice. Her son's gotten into some mess on the other side. We could use some help. That's not my world. It's over the line. You know anybody who could help? I'll have to leave Orfeo with my cousin. Detective Suarez? This looks like trouble. I don't need any trouble. These people need to talk to you. Not at my house, they don't. Gracias, Leslie. Gotta watch my cholesterol. So. I want him back. And if there's any way, I don't want him to go to jail. This is Juan Calles. Now, you must still have friends on the local force. No. There was a federal sting. My voice is on the tapes. I didn't take any money, but... you gotta be careful who you do favors for. Charges? I had to resign, lost my pension. I have money. The first one is to look into it, should take me a day or two to find out if there's anything I can do. The second one is a bonus, if I find him. Dead or alive. Look, I don't have that much. You know, maybe I could put together half, and then pay you the rest over time. Two thousand up front then, cash. We used to call him "The Terminator." Like the movie. How you been, pequeña? That's my baby. Huh. Your man got a job? Husband. He's a plumber. He need an assistant? Jesus. Not here. I'm supposed to be retired. Chula. You're doin' good. Yeah. Makes our life in prison seem like a dream. More like a nightmare. Like a dream for me. A nice one. Take care of yourself, Fontayne. 150, 250, 350, 450, 550, 650, 750, 850. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. Get a money order for this tomorrow. Go to the office and pay the property taxes. This isn't dangerous, is it? Of course not. Well, if it's not dangerous, why did they pay you so much money? Because of my years of expertise. It's not illegal? It's no big deal, really. It's just a missing person kind of thing. Do you have your pills? I do all the leg work, you'll do all the driving. What, they took away your license, too? I flunked the eye exam. I got macular degeneration. I'm like a blur to you? I do all right. At the corner make a right. Hey, Freddy. I like your posse. Who is that guy, Tony Orlando? You still got my package? Gettin' back in the saddle? Somethin' like that. My sister been married to a police, 40 years. She had to have a screw loose. I ain't a cop no more. Oh, yes, you are. You look like one. You smell like one. Juan Calles. I better tell Ynez to get started on the funeral arrangements. Has he been around? Not lately. Since when, not lately? About two weeks. Might have passed over into T.J. He stay there? If he came back, I didn't see him. I need to fill this. Shame Ynez won't qualify for the widow's benefits. I understand this has been compromising for you, and I appreciate it. I'll put you on the bus in the morning. What do you mean? You done what I needed. Hooked me up, so-- This ain't over. What can you do down here? What can you do? You ever been a cop on the street? No, I went straight to corrections from youth counseling. Then I ain't leavin' you alone down here. I'm not alone, I'm with Suarez. Blind old cop, been tossed off the force. If you don't go back, you'll lose your job. My parole officer will give me another one. One where I don't smell like bacon all the time. Jobs are hard to come by. Tell me about it. What would you do, if you could do anything you wanted? -You remember. -What? We were gonna be stewardesses. Right. In Hawaii. You're down from Oakland, you're Rubin James Zoletti. Rubin James. Who's in San Quentin. Got it. I don't like her taking chances. She's a big girl. I'm the one in law enforcement. You ever buy drugs on the street? No. Turn here. She's gonna do fine. Pull over. We'll wait. So you did somebody a favor? Another cop. He was my best friend. He was doing something that he shouldn't have, and I looked the other way. If you'd done the other thing, you'd have turned him in, how you think you'd feel about it? I'll never know, will I? I got a date with Tenoch. You Tenoch? Wassup? Your boy Fito put me onto you. Pull your shirt up. Now the arms. Those look old. This ain't for me. Whatever, how much you want? A finger of the black eagle. Two grand. You're dreamin'. Dreamin'? You know, my regular customers get it for a little over half of that. But you're no regular customer, are you? Well, nice knowin' you. Hold on, hold on. What's your hurry? I ain't got time to fuck around. Sit down. You know, it's nice to have somebody from the old school drop by. These days, these days, you gotta have a fuckin' graduate degree to stay in business. You know, flunitrazepam, hydroxybutyrate, M.D.M.A. -College boy drugs. -Yeah. Yeah, but heroin? Shit, that's vintage, sister. All right. I'll hook you up. A finger for a grand and a half. 1,200. See, now you're just pissin' me off. What the fuck. Let's do it. All right, follow me. Scoot over. Oh, get the fuck outta here, man. Move it. You know, I ain't got shit-- I ain't got shit. I'm Agent Suarez, Drug Enforcement Agency. This is Detective Gamble, San Diego P.D. And the lady holding the latest in surveillance technology is my colleague, Agent Parmoli. All you got is talk. Officer Gamble, did you receive anything from the suspect? He gave me this. This looks like exhibit A to me, Tenoch. Y'all can't do this shit, man. You can't do this, this ain't fuckin' Mexico. You have three law enforcement officers as witnesses. We have a recorded conversation. And after we have this substance analyzed back at the-- Motherfuckers, man. You motherfuckers. There is another way to handle this. Nah, no, no, no. Nah, I ain't no snitch. What? Juan Calles. What about him? He's gone. Make him come back. What is this thing, really? Guitar tuner. It hooks onto the neck. You play? My father crossed illegally in 1950s. He followed the crops. He sold melons on the side of the road. He saved till he had enough to bring us all up here. And he would say to me, "You're an American now. Act like one." So I started a rock and roll band. Freddy and the Debonairs. Suarez. Yeah. Okay. I'll meet you there. Juan Calles. He wants to surrender to me. So we've been runnin' yellow fish, mainly Fujian. The Snakeheads get them into Belize. They get 'em over the Rio and on to Mexico and then-- then all the way over to Sonora on the Arizona border. The Coyotes walk 'em over, and then we load 'em in a truck and haul 'em up to Tucson or Phoenix or L.A., and then they're on their own. Lucrative? Some of these people pay 50 grand to get into the country. Yeah, we get a piece of that. You get a truckload of 30-40 Chinese, that's a lot of feria. But somebody stuffed up. Pinche Fuzzy was doing some side business when we were partying in T.J., and he gets busted by the Federales. You know those Mexican jails, man. So he told the story. Yeah, and they let him walk. But he didn't let me and the Rod in on it. There was big bust in Nogales, and the Snakeheads get hauled in, the paying customers. And Rodney's still in T.J. with this new girlfriend. So that's who gets snatched by the Chinos. You hear from them? They sent me his ear, man. Oh, Jesus. And then they came back up and they got Fuzzy. How much they want? A hundred grand. They think all Americans are rich, even Morenos, no offense. Underground, that's crazy. So you're gonna put me in protective custody, right? You know anybody in Albuquerque? No. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, good. Here's 500 cash. Tomorrow you buy a ticket to Albuquerque. Why's that? Not too many Chinos. Fuck, dude. 500? Cutbacks, homes. The fat times are over. I gotta get a drink. Be careful crossing the highway. You'll cover expenses. I don't have any 100,000. That's only the opening figure. They like to haggle a little to see if you're really serious. What's next? We go to T.J. You're leavin' the U.S.A.? Look, I'll write you up some paperwork, just in case. That won't be a problem, will it? Me crossing with you two. We gotta take some pictures. From this point on, they got cameras on you, looking for suspicious characters. That'd be us. We gotta look relaxed. Like we're on a holiday. Sing something. Fontayne sings. Throw it down, girl, and smile. What? Sing. ♪ Just a closer walk with thee ♪ Louder. ♪ Just a closer walk with thee ♪ ♪ Grant us, Jesus, if you please ♪ Tempo, bring it up. ♪ Really walking close to thee ♪ ♪ Next to thee, dear lord, next to thee ♪ That's it, tempo. ♪ I am weak, but thou are strong ♪ ♪ Ooh, yeah ♪ ♪ As I walked down the river ♪ Morning. Good morning. Identification, please. How long do you plan on staying in Mexico? Two days. Two days. Purpose of your trip? We're playing a party for a friend's wedding. Freddy Suarez, Ocean. These two are Ocean. Señora, can you please open the case? A Rickenbacker 360. Single-coil pickups. Original. Have a nice wedding. Thank you. I ain't never been out the country before. I went to Puerto Rico once. With your husband? Before Rodney. You like it? Layin' on the beach next to a good-lookin' man, shoot. Know the place, huh? I was supposed to come down here and lay low for a while, but I got my ass incarcerated. Did you find what you was lookin' for? I got a good idea where to start. Make that two. So you got connections with the local police? Maybe. But the police don't run this town. Put your purse under the table and open it. I'm gonna place my pistol in it. You want me to hold it? For the moment, yeah. I got a feelin'. Border towns. Really good people here. But you also get the worst of both sides. Have relatives here? T.J.? No. I'm a pocho down for holiday. It's too hot. I need something here. I barely speak the language. Mexican different down here? This isn't Mexico. This is like a theme park... for bad behavior. Gracias. Gracias, señor. Here you go. You should get one of these. What is it? Juan Soldado. Patron saint of illegal border crossers, soldiers who have been betrayed by their superiors. Just give her five bucks. Can I say prayers to it? You can. To really do it, just light a candle and make a wish. What do we do now? All right. You go back to the hotel. I'm gonna go around town and spread the word a little bit. That's all? Should be enough. Hasta luego, señoras. You talk Spanish? I took a course for the job, but I'm lousy at it. Now which way's the damn hotel? Mother Han. Among other languages. Yes. What is it you want to buy? A young black man. You're the wrong century and the wrong country, my friend. Buy is not the right word. More like an exchange. I saw images of the dead. I saw articles of veneration, and to those who believe, I saw miracles. But I do not deal in human beings. Not even to move them from one place to another? You have me mistaken for somebody else. Well, then... if somebody were in Tijuana, wanted to find a person being held up for trade, where would he go? Some of my customers have prayed to El Santo and reported wonderful results. You know all the vendors. Any of them want to unload an African American male by the name of Rodney Stokes, I'm at the Estrella de Bajo Hotel. Rodney started playing football. I wanted him to... to try soccer, but he said it was for pussies. The very first game I went to, you know, the play where they... they--they run at each other? Kickoff? He ran snap into this other kid and got knocked unconscious. And he just... flat. And I ran out, and they had... got his helmet off, but there was only the guy that, you know, wraps the tape around their ankles. So I... I got down on my knees, and I--I... pulled that, um... that plastic thing that protects the teeth out, and I... and I... started mouth to mouth. He wasn't breathing? He was cold. And there was steam coming out of the mouths of all the other players. And there was nothing from Rodney. You saved his life. I don't know, maybe. I mean, he was just... He took a lot of shit later... from his friends, you know? French kissing his mama. Sounds right. At the time, you know, I thought he'd rather die than be embarrassed like that. You can't protect him forever, Bernice. You can try. You hook up with somebody else, after your husband passed? Not for long. I mean, when you get older, you just--you get... Standards? Yeah. Not highest, maybe, but, you know... take all that mess you did when you were in your 20s. You? I don't know. I don't think I'm even a dyke. Not a real one. Now when you're inside... locked up... you're in a situation, right? That Chula? Man, I ain't never been more in love than I was with that girl. Nice pair of cheerleaders. Uh-oh. You're up, you're up, and when you're down, you're down. And when you're up against Fremont... ...you're up! Pivot, side, down. The red and the green. I'll go back and live in that world again in a heartbeat. You know, he probably out buyin' rounds for his amigos on your money. What if he don't come back? Maybe your friend overestimated Freddy. He hasn't been on the force for a while. That blind detective shit ain't too bad, either. I don't think he handin' out any refunds. I'mma try somethin'. What's that? This is Rodney's phone bill. There's a long distance number he calls almost every day. Talks at least 15 minutes. And it's the same area code from this area. You got a story ready? Hola. ...Rodney Stokes. Oh, you speak English. Who? Okay. Zeidy, listen. I am Rodney's mother. And I am here in Tijuana. Where are you? Club Macondo. Calle... "Pi-ya Wella." Right, okay. Okay, listen, so, I'm--I'm on my way, and you won't have any problem recognizing me. No. Sweetie, you and I have to talk. So, I'm on my way. Okay. Rodney got himself a girl. Yeah. Club Macondo. Let's go. Well, what about Freddy? You know what? He can wait for us for once. I'll bring the map. Ms. Stokes? Yeah, that's me. This is Rodney's aunt. Hello. So, what goes on in there? A little bit of everything. I only serve drinks to the men. Is that where you met Rodney? Yes. Maybe... six month ago. And when was the last time you saw him? Last week. He stays with me for the night. You know what he been doin'? How he been makin' money? He helps people to go north. He helps? They pay money. Well, do you know how we can contact these people he's been workin' for? Los Chinos? The Chinese. No. You don't wanna talk to them. You don't want to meet them. Oh no, yes we do! You know, they have him. Have him? Kidnapped, holdin' him for ransom. Do you know if he's still alive? Is he alive? As far as we can tell. He's alive. I don't--I don't like what he's been doing with this--this thing. He's--but he's a man, you know? He has his ways and his ideas. So long hombre. So these people that he works for, do you think that-- Maybe, mi--mi primo. Maybe we can ask my primo. Your cousin? My cousin, yes. Nestor from Mexicali. I'll write it down for you. Does your cousin know these people? Yes. He knows the... he has chicken for the battle. Cock fighting. Yes. The Chinese, they all come and bet their money to the fight, to the battle. It's Mexicali, it's not very far from here. It's another city. Un momento. I was gonna meet with him after work. We was gonna go to Ensenada. But he never comes. Do you know his friends? His American friends? Juan Calles, and this other people, cómo se llama, Fuzzy. Fuzzy Niles. I don't like him. He's not good. He have Mexican friends? Not really. But a guy he makes business with. What's the name? But that one is very peligroso. He's muy dangerous. What's the name? Who is he? Rufo. He lives over there. Sometimes he stays there. Rodney make you any promises? Uh... you have a good son. He's a very good son, your son. Would you tell me if you find him? Which one of you is Rufo? Yo. You speak English? It's my second language. Can I speak with you alone for a minute? What you want with me? You know Rodney Stokes? Oh, Rod? That's what I call him, yeah. What are you, his mommy? That's right. He's been a naughty boy. You know where he is? That depends. Depends on what? How bad you want to find out. So, we're talking money. That is my first language. Hey, lady. You like what you see? You mean you two, or the titty books? You got a card? A card? A money card. Cómo se dice? ATM. ATM card. I ain't got nothin' like that. All Americans got a card. Not the ones that can't get credit. Maybe we take you to a machine, and you show me how to use that card. Dream on. Maybe you got it in a pocket. Back off-- Hey, don't you push me, moronita. Hey! Move away from her. You don't come here and be telling us what to do. I said to move the fuck away from her! Whoa, Bernice. Now, you really fucked up, lady. Do you know who I am? Policía municipal. I don't see a uniform. Now you're gonna hand me that pistol. Oh, shit! You wanna piece of this? Don't shoot! Move. I coulda handled them. Let's go. Juan Gabriel. So... ex-detective Suarez. What can I do for you? Chinese that are crossing from here. Not my people. But you know them. They pay a little mordida. Permission to do business in my territory. Of course, they lie. Pinche Chinos. They always make more than twice what they admit to. They have an American. So? They're cutting pieces off of him every day. Pretty soon, there'll be nothing left. I need you to tell them to give him back. Do you know the name, Rocio Duenez? The DEA agent you people tortured to death. Yes, so here's what I'm going to do for you. I'm not going to torture you. But you will disappear south of the border. I said, I need your help. Excuse me, do I... owe you a favor, ex-detective Suarez? No favor. Okay, let's do business. What do you have that I want? Something that's worth more than the gringo. You remember the drug bust in '07 in Kern County? The one where you people said you got 50 kilos? Which is bullshit. You people always exaggerate. We only sent up 20. We only found five. Five? The mule, who was stabbed full of holes in Delano, he never made the phone call. Then who? Ask your compinche up there. What's his name? Ask him what happened to your 15 keys. And you know this? That was on the bust. No kidding. They say he has a avocado farm up in Santa Paula. Fifteen keys. What's that worth on the street today? One gringo negro? I've done a lot of funky business, but I ain't never shot nobody. Look, I have had training. That don't mean you shoot no cop! Well, he got what he deserved! How hard is it gonna be for them to spot two black women in this town? He's gonna be too embarrassed to take you to court. I mean, lettin' a woman shoot him. Please. This ain't goin' to no court. These people, they don't play that shit. Okay. Come on! Are we lost? No! That Rufo say anything? He said to take my money and blow me off. I should've shot his ass. You're dangerous, girl. Gettin' all Dirty Harry and shit. You know what? I'm sorry. I will get you out of this clean. I promise. Why you hang with me? Shit, girl, I need your help. Nah, I mean, back in school. Back in school? You were loyal... till Carlos Washington. You were... a good person. I was a good person. You are. You are a good person. When I'm not dopin', yeah. Well then, I guess you got a choice then, don't you? Go on, go on, go on, go on. I'm sorry. I sound like a teacher. It's all right. You ain't the one that gotta get her pee pee evaluated every week. We wanna be on Constitution. I haven't seen a street name in quite a while. Well, we see the 18th in November. Oh, what, what? We just passed Freddy. Freddy! Freddy, Freddy! Yo, we gotta go. The car's just up here. Why aren't you at the hotel? Bernice shot somebody. Shot somebody? With my gun? You gave it to her, bro. Woman's cold. All right, let's go. I gave you people a simple instruction. Which way to the hotel? I told you just to stay in the room and keep your heads down. Make a right. Cop car up ahead. Just be cool. Did you kill the guy? If I wanted to kill him, he would be dead. I just put him down with one in a leg. That's all? Well, they'll hold a parade for us. Just go straight. You're gonna give me your room key, and then you're gonna drop me off, slow down. Then you're gonna go past the hotel, drive into the parking lot, and wait with your engine turned off in the back where it's dark. That's all, okay? And then what? We gotta make it to Mexicali. If your son's still alive, that's where he is. How'd you get that information? I made a deal with the devil. Who's this? Oh, shit! God! Oh, my God. They're gone. You okay? Yeah. Fontayne? Yeah. You hit him? Couldn't even see them. Shot up into the air. Put holes in the car. Get me to the hotel. The bullet must've passed right between us and gone out past the back window. Maybe they're still out there. Maybe. He showed his friends he don't take no shit. That may be enough. One way or another, we gotta get the hell out of Dodge. You were right. It's still open. Oh, man, T.J. never sleeps. Won't that attract a lot of attention? Not as much as these. Navajas will be sending word to the Chinese to release your son, but he doesn't control them. They're smugglers, not professional kidnappers. What does that mean? That your son might be dead already. Man, you got us out here in the middle of nowhere. I mean, we can't contact him? He'll contact us. We're gonna split up, move around town. Ask questions. Be visible. And stay out of trouble. And if they find us? You call me immediately. We'll play it from there. Where do we start? You two, La Chinesca, Chinatown. Señor, buenas días. Sí, I am learning this... Kelly's in the red house, Caroli's in the yellow house. Actually... what we're trying to find is who... if--if you wanted to bring people from down here to like... Houston or Los Angeles, who would we-- But this is what I am doing. Ramiro Chow. I'm opening. Sit yourselves, please. Please, sit, sit. You really are a travel agent? Where do you wish to be seen? There is many places in Baja, or in other areas of my country. We're more interested in other kind of travel. Other? Like crossin' the border illegally? Ah. The colorful history of Mexicali, eh? My own abuelo, my grandfather, once upon a time, has a cantina where he smuggles el alcohol, the alcohol. There was a under the border where they would pass the liquor. And the people-- Chinese people? Como yo, sí. At this time, eh, Mexicalis has more Chinos than Mexicanos ves. These tunnels still down there? Well I don't have a tour, pero... We're looking for the people that smuggled Chinese illegally into the States. De estranjeros, cómo? Foreigners. No, no, no, no, I no have nothing to do with it, no. Okay, well, thank you for your time. But, no, no, espere. Esperes un momentito. I show you something. Some of these things are still left from the day mi abuelo. This goes all the way to the other side? Do you wanna look? -You good? -Yeah. You'd have to crawl from here on. Not me. Spiders and shit in there. What, you never tried to dig your way out of prison? Somebody been watchin' the movies. Man, you got to be some awful kinda desperate to be crawling underground like an insect. People doin' it every day. It's mostly instinct. Gallos wanna fight each other to be the last one standing and screw the gallinas. You gotta keep their blood up. This one won't fight. Look, your cousin Zeidy, she-- La puta. She's a waitress. For her family, working in that place? She's a puta. She said you could help us. I heard she was tied up with one of yours. That a problem? Depends on the guy. The last one she was with, Mexicano, a hotel stealer. Thief. And this one? He's being held, we think, here in Mexicali, by the Chinese. They've been told to let him go, but we need to make contact. And Zeidy wants this cabrón back? We all do. Wait here. Hey, look, his name is Rodney. Wait here. I knew this guy used to raise dogs, fight each other. Barbaric. I know people pay to see boxers knock the hell out of each other. Well, at least they got a choice. Maybe. The choices you make, that's who you are, Fontayne. I know people inside get comfortable with it. The bars, the buzzers, the rules. Day starts and there's not so many possibilities, you know, good or bad. They say to go to the other side and follow the truck. That's all you're gonna get. So, they--they still have him? Follow the truck. Follow the truck. Siga el camion. They were watching you, watching all of us. Why wouldn't they let us know where it is? They have their own way of doing things, los Chinos. They told us to cross over to the other side. It won't be far from the border crossing. Got a feeling the truck is in use. They get the people across somehow. Load 'em up over here. Through the tunnels? Tunnels are rumors. We went down in one. We didn't go far, but-- So, you think they took Rodney's truck and they're using it? Something like that. There's a possibility we haven't considered. Your son might be part of all this. Why would he do that? Because he needs money. Because he knows you can put it together. Look, there's a lot of kidnappings down here. We have to think about all the variations. Rodney wouldn't do that. -Is that it? -Where? We just passed it on the right. Make a turn here, nice and easy. It's on the side street? Yeah. Take a left here. Pull over. You guys wait here. Drive. Where to? Some place where we can park and not catch too much attention. Not too far. I put a tracer on it. Anywhere it goes, we can follow. Turn here. And now? If the truck is turned on or starts to move, this device here will buzz like a banshee. Pass me my jacket. I need to take a nap. Yeah, I can remember stuff from when we were back in school, but I can't remember how I felt, you know, how it felt to be me. Like that was another person. Long time ago. Not just that, jail, all the doping, was like there's a big wall that separates me from what come before. You ever wanna have kids? I almost did, once. We got pretty far along, too. I was so fucked up, my health. You lost it? Maybe it sensed where it was headed, had the good sense not to be born. I almost lost Rodney, too. And he came a month early. You know, his lungs weren't getting enough oxygen so they had to do, you know, a procedure where they couldn't say whether he was gonna survive or not. Little thing. Yeah, he had asthma really bad when he was little, you know? Still gets an attack now and then. He had this idea in his head that the army somehow found out and that's why they stuck him in transport. The way he used to fight to breathe. Now he got all them muscles, and a truck, and a girlfriend who works in a titty bar. They're leaving. Yeah, they're goin' somewhere. Now the dial hands here show the relation to us. At twelve o'clock we're following them. If it goes to the right, you turn right. The higher pitch the beeps, the stronger the signal, the closer we are. Signal's good for five miles. They're going. No hurry, okay. We don't want to get pulled over. Doesn't matter if we can't see them, we've got the signal. We don't wanna catch up? We follow them until they stop and then we'll figure it out from there. Right now, we just hope that they don't go back into Mexico. Border Patrol spot checks this highway. Sometimes the smugglers sense there's a cop car ahead, call back if the coast is clear. Damn, we almost to Yuma. Might be a pick up there, but, could be going all the way through to Phoenix. Well, how far is Phoenix? We've got half a tank of gas left. Chinga, I didn't think of that. And if we stop? They'll be out of driving range. What did that last sign say? Next exit 33 miles. Hit the gas, we gotta go past them, pick up a couple of minutes, get gas wherever we can. What if they pull off after we pass? We'll turn back and go looking for them, now gun it. And if we get stopped for speeding by the police, do we tell them to stop the truck? That's up to you, Bernice. Smuggling people is still a Federal. There they are. Yeah, I can't see who's driving. Keep the speed up. What does the dial say? It's six o'clock now. Don't go too far ahead that you lose the signal. Getting closer. There he goes, moving pretty good. I--I got this. He just went by. Damn. Come on. Hang it up, let's go! If they've stopped it, we'll go past them and then pull over, and I'll walk back and do the concerned citizen routine, and we'll find out what's up. Needle's at nine now. They've gone off-road. Slow down. Find us a place to turn off. Put your low beams on, and follow the signal. You're gonna have to do some dodging. Nice and easy, we don't need to lose a tire. That's it, stop the car. You lost them? Probably found a farm road or some dry wash to run on. They left us in the dust. Fontayne, get the county map. You see the highway we were on? Yeah, I got it. Go north of it, see any roads? There's just some little bitty ones, I think they're on an Indian reservation. Hey, I need the light. Shhh. Border patrol's got to have sensors out here. Cut the headlights. Got a story if they find us? Not one they'll believe. Okay. I'm gonna walk ahead, find a good path. You guys'll follow me, but no lights. We'd better be on a road by sun up. And then what? They're probably heading into Phoenix, we can use the tracker there. Sorry, baby. We gonna find him, don't you worry about that. I have an old friend down here in the INS, he'll probably be at work by ten. I'll have him check to see if anything notable got picked up last night. Which way is Phoenix? Maybe 50 miles. Let's go. The sentencing usually goes by how many people have been transported, and if they were put in any danger. He'd get two years inside at the minimum, two years supervised release. Unless of course he wants to cooperate with some kind of a sting against those people, which case, he could cut a deal. You ever done time? No, I haven't. And you know the kind of jobs a man done time is likely to get, if he can get a job. I'm just saying, it's not the end of the world. That is if they're not just playing with us, and getting us out of their hair. If they haven't already killed him. I didn't say anything like that. If they'd already killed him, when your man in Tijuana made the call, what would they do? Lead us on some chase, then get us out of Mexico and give them time to clean things up. Look, there are plenty of possibilities, okay? Where's the dial? It's at ten o'clock. There's a road to the left. Take it. Twelve o'clock. Okay, that's dead ahead of us. By the beeps, they're not movin'. Rodney? Rodney? Get the other side. I got water in the car. Not enough. Rodney. Oh, no, no, no. Baby. Mama? Oh, it's okay, shhh. It's okay. It's okay. We gave your friend Juan some money. He's in hiding. What about Fuzzy? They killed him. It's all over, Rodney. You are free and clear. Just breathe, honey. Just breathe. Just breathe. Yeah, we're just driving on Camino del Diablo, right by, ah, Coyote Wash, and there's a whole bunch of men running around out there. No, we didn't stop. They looked-- this is kind of funny, they looked Chinese. Yeah. We just thought you should know. They'll get sent back. They didn't reach their destination that they paid for. They'll get a full refund and get another crack at it. Chinese are expensive but they're thorough. I didn't think there was a chance in hell, but I just hung to be with Bernice when she got the bad news. You must have been some hot shit behind that badge, Freddy. Callin' me The Terminator. Hey. Checkin' up on me? I--I wanted to come by in person, I had them take me off your case. You'll have Betty Nakamura, she--she's okay. Good. Last one I had was a bitch on wheels. No matter, she'd like to shoot ya. How's Rodney? Oh, he's doing better. He got a--a prosthetic ear, it doesn't look bad. He sold that truck. So you're off my case. Too weird for ya, huh? No, I don't know. I don't have that many... that many friends. You don't want to complicate things. So, ah, what time does your shift end? Five. You--you wanna do something? Like what? Whatever. Sure. Yeah, that'd be cool.
