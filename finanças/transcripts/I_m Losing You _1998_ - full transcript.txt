Captioning made possible by lions gate films You said...There's a 90% mortality rate in the first year. Does that mean that after 12 months... Perry... Mortality is 100%. Jeez, I never felt better in my life. You may continue to. When you begin having discomfort, we'll be very aggressive in managing the pain. Don't fuck with me, frank. Jesus, it's like a movie. Perry, you're in stage 4. I can't say when you'll become florid. Well, what am I, a fucking bouquet now? What about chemo? You'd go on it, and you'd never get off. It's more of a leeching than anything else. Oh, god. Oh, Jesus. Oh, shit. I'd hate to see you go through that. There are other things that we can explore, some of them experimental. Are you sure it's, uh...Adeno-- adenocarcinoma. You know how much money I made last year, frank? I made $8 million. Perry... I wish to god-- not a word to diantha. I'll tell her when I tell her. And the kids. Oh, god...My kids. How'd it go? Great. This director always calls me back. Loves my wild eyes... You know, what I used to be. Bertie... Never hires me. I'm too "cable." Not to mention boyish and endearing. You think i'm too endearing, sissy? Saccharine and repellent come to mind. Nice. [Chuckles] There's somethin' I want to ask you. Oh, god. Here comes repellent. I need 1,500 for the car. What is wrong with it now?! The trannie dropped out. You know-- the catalytic converter isn't converting. The usual. I can pay you back. I got a job selling insurance. I start tomorrow. Why don't you just do daddy's show? Be a vorbalid on the starship demeter? I don't think so, Rachel. You're an actor. You have a little girl to think about, and it's a steady income. Oh, I forgot to get dad a present. What'd you get him? A watch. An expensive one. For 60 years of service. How is he, anyway? 6-0's a big one. I think he's having a midlife crisis. "Midlife"? For methuselah, maybe. You're horrible. 60 is not old. A babe in the fuckin' woods. [Chuckles] Tiffany! Pappy! You are the most gorgeous girl in the world. Hey, can I stay at Lily's tonight? Not tonight, sweetheart. Why? Because pappy's tired. He's had a long, hard day of not being cast in a major film. Say hi to your auntie. [Gloomily] Hi, Rachel. Hi, sad sack. Sure is a pretty dress. Grandma bought it for me. Did she also get you this purple nail Polish? I bought it. Question, tiff-- if a man has lived for 60 years... That's not fair. I mean... Do you think that's old? That is very old. You are such a bastard. [Chuckles] Attention, everyone! Attention! Everyone, shut up! I want to sing an obscure little song to my husband. Now, I know most of you do not know it. But for those of you who do, you may sing along. * happy birthday to you * happy birthday to you * happy birthday, dear Perry * * happy birthday to you * keep comin' back hey, this is an aa-free zone. Blow out the candles, darling. "And Sinbad gave him another hundred sequins "and told him that every day "there'd be a place laid for him at his table "and that he could always rely upon the friendship of Sinbad the sailor." That's all for tonight, kiddo. Pappy... Is Rachel my "first" aunt... Or my real aunt? You want to run that by me again? Well, Rachel was adopted by grandma and grandpa. Uh-huh... So she isn't your real sister. I think of her as my virtual sis. But you don't have the same parents. I knew that. If she's grandpa's brother's daughter, that means she's your first cousin. Isn't she? All true. And now I dutifully declare that you, Tiffany krohn, sailorwoman, are hereby in charge of the care and feeding of the krohn family tree. But, pappy, wait. If Rachel's your first cousin... That means you can marry her. Tiff, did you skip your ritalin today? I don't take ritalin. We can remedy that. Time for sleep. But first cousins always marry. At least in the arabian nights. They roast goats in the backyard, too, but we're not into that until the residual checks dry up. Won't you ever get married again? I knew there was a serious subtext here. Yes, I will. But first you need to find the right girl, and you need lots of money. Why do you need lots of money? Because Mrs. Right likes it that way. Ok? Say "I love you," scheherazade. I love you, scheherazade. [Laughter on TV] [Perry moaning passionately] Darling? What's the matter? Oh, I was on my way to the kitchen, and then I thought... Why bother? [Chuckles] You'll take a chill. I'll get your robe. No, I won't. Don't. I won't take a chill. And don't talk to me like some frontier granny. Do you want to hurt me, Perry? Because I'm not up for it. [Sighs] Diantha... Did you come? What do you mean? What do you mean, "what do you mean"? Did you come? No. But that's not unusual for me. Perry... Is it your birthday that's got hold of you? What's wrong? What it is... What it is, lady diantha, is... I'm dying. He said, in a word. Thus spake the vorbalid. You are drunk. Come to bed. I didn't want to tell you because... Well... "Chickenshit" enters into it somewhere. What are you saying? I had a physical. Frank found nodules on both my lungs. Oh, god. At first they thought it was a fungus. Then they did some frozen...Section. A-deee-nocarcinoma, they call it. No. No, it's add-e-nocarcinoma. Stage 4, just like the nuclear reactor at chernobyl. I'll talk to frank. Oh, no. There's nothing they can do. Nothing. When did... When did you go? Last week. Funny thing is, I...i never felt better in my life. I have no bloody stools. I have no night sweats. I have no... Tremors, no seizures, no blackouts. Come to bed. I'm fine. I want you to put something on. No, no. You're not listening to me. I don't want to hear-- hey! Listen! I am not kidding! You want to see the fucking X-ray?! No. Want me to slice myself open with a bulgari letter opener and show you a warty lung? Huh? As exhibit "a"? That what you want?! God damn it! I want you to come to bed! No! No! No! [Sobbing] I just want you to come to bed! Come to bed. Come to bed. [Sobbing] Come to bed. [Children laughing] [Dog barks] Kenny...you're a dentist. Your profession certainly hasn't been untouched by this terrible disease. That's absolutely correct. There's a lot of lip service given to awareness, but you... And Marion... Will be doing something concrete. You will be tangibly easing human suffering. That's what's so appealing... To me. And this is the time to do it, folks. There's a window. The industry's still unregulated. It won't be like that forever. Besides, people are recovering from this thing now. How, exactly, does it work? Basically, what you're doing is buying the life insurance policy of someone who's terminally ill. In effect, you are giving that person a lump-sum advance-- accelerating his benefits, making his passing a little easier. It's a blessing all the way around. Here's someone I'd like you to look at. His name is Philip dagrom. Good place for you to start. He's got a t-cell count of 22, which is relatively low. I saw him last Friday. He's pretty much clinically depressed. Yeah. Who wouldn't be? He doesn't look all that bad. That was taken a month ago. He's been through thrush, pneumonia... You name it. I'd say we're looking at a 6-to-9-month expectancy. And I hate to say it, but I am usually spot-on, plus or minus a month or 2. Mmm. How did he become...Ill? Hemophiliac...and gay. The irony is, it's been established that it was a blood transfusion that was the agent of transmission. I've worked on hemophiliacs. Wow. How do you fill a cavity? [Chuckling] Very carefully. Kenny. If Philip... Suddenly gets better... Which, of course, we hope he does... How does that affect our investment? Phil's just not responding to the crixivan. There hasn't been a lot of long-term testing on these drugs. People who were getting better are crashing. Their viral loads are going through the roof. Look...i would love to be able to get out of this business. The sad truth is that most of the people we're dealing with are just too sick to be helped. Hmm. What will he do with the advance? If we... Buy the policy? He wants to take a cruise. I think he'd like to die in Greece. More coffee? I'd love some. Uh, what kind of insurance does he have? $100,000 policy. Philip's a, uh, costumer designer for television. It's so sad. How does that translate into dollars? You'd be getting 92,500 on your original investment of 74 and change. When he dies. When he dies. [Piano plays pop tune] The doctors are worse than the lawyers. Did you get a second opinion? Everybody talks to each other. My x-rays are all over the Internet. From cedars to Sloan-kettering, the medicos concur-- I'm dead meat. When you coming back to the show? The costume department is doing very well without me. Besides, how many ways can you dress a vorbalidian diplomat? Well, maybe it's for the best. 'Cause you look like hell. I am death warmed over. You're death warming up. Mmm. You know, you ought to put US on the tube. We could do the nineties version of, uh... Run for your life. Remember that show? Yeah. Ben gazzara. Doctors gave him a year to live. What did he have, anyway? They found spots on his career. [Laughs] You need anything, Philip? I got pots and pots of money. Listen. Tell me, for once... What can I do for you? You could get me a new pair of lungs. You know...The kind without the hundred fuckin' little tumors. You say it's been in the family a long time? My father brought it from Germany before the holocaust. It's supposed to be the Duke of marlborough. Well, I think you'll do very well with this. I knew you'd help. I've seen you at the temple. Your father was a cantor, no? Yes, he was. Lenny kronowicz? That's right. I knew Leonard in New York. That's amazing. I remember you when you were a tiny little girl. Did you know I did your mother's tahara? I--i don't know what that is. I sat with her through the night... Before she was buried. My parents died in a plane crash. Their bodies were never found. Your mother's bernice, no? If...you'll excuse me? I'm unbelievably late. If you'd like to leave the painting... Yes, I would. And, um... I'm sorry if I... Oh, it's fine. It's just a little strange when someone comes and tells you that they did... Whatever to your mother. I'm sorry. US magazine is doing a blue matrix feature... And they want to follow you around for a few days. Fuck...them. You've got the scopus awards tonight at the century Plaza, and you need to be there no later than 6:30. Uh, Dr. Litvak called. Oh-- Mona dewaere doesn't like her hair. Mona dewaere... Does not like her hair. [Chuckles] It might be nice if you took a little walk down to the set. Yeah. * hello anybody home? Mona! Well, what a surprise. Come in. Come in. You're sure I'm not disturbing you? No, not at all. Sit down. I was just coming over to see you. Well? What do you think? It's absurd. [Chuckling] Thank god you said that. I was terrified you were gonna love it. It just tries too hard, doesn't it? Mmm. I feel like an intergalactic dildo. Ha ha ha ha! The hair is history. Are you sure? I've been feeling very diva-like today. No, no, no. Don't be silly. I can't tell you how delighted we all are to have you on the starship demeter. Mmm. Very happy to be here. Do you know my son hasn't missed a single episode of blue matrix, ever? In fact, that's one of the reasons I'm doing your show. Because now he thinks I'm the coolest mom in the whole world. Do you have kids? Yeah. I've got 2. And I have a little grandchild. Sweet little thing. Aren't they extraordinary? Yes. But I'm serious about your show. The writing's so good. Each episode is like a small play. It's become quite an industry, hasn't it? Oh, god, you've got no idea. We're setting up the star channel. We have our own shopping network-- wormhole detectors, porcelain plates with painted faces... Your face, your very beautiful face-- Mona dewaere on a plate. You ready for that? Oh, god, yes. I always wanted to be what one finds at the bottom of one's porridge. And the conventions. Those I might not be ready for. I liked your last movie. It was the one with Finney? Mm-hmm. Slow dancing. It's marvelous. Really. My wife's a big fan, and I might as well confess it-- I've had a crush on you for years and years. Hello, lidia. Hi, Bertram. You look nice. Date tonight? Business. You're late. Am I? Oh. I was with sheryl. Her boyfriend beat her up last night. She's completely freaked out. You know sheryl. You could've called. I'm sorry, bertie. I was totally unaware of the time. I--i went into caretaking mode. Uh-huh. How's the pumpkin? She might be getting a cold. Did you give her echinacea? She's taking goldenseal. Too late for the cirque du soleil? I don't think that's going to happen, 'cause sheryl was supposed to get US the tickets. Anyway, my boss is having a party in fucking tarzana, and he's a new boss, so I kinda have to go. Bummer. You want to take tiff another night? No, it'll be fun. You know, we should have dinner one night, the three of US. That'd be nice. Lidia... I can cancel my plans, if you want to have her another time. It's fine, bertie. He's got kids. Big house, big pool. She's not going in the water. It's heated, bertrum. She's getting a cold, lidia. Didn't you just hear me tell you that? Hello, baby girl! Oh, don't you look cute! Are we going to the circus? We're gonna go to a really fun party in tarzana. Oh! Damn it! Uhh! I'm sorry. I'm ok. I've been taking all this tetracycline for the last 6 days, and it is really fucking with my balance. Tiff, would you go inside for a minute? Why? I want to talk to your mom. It's ok, pumpkin. I'm ok. Ohh. What? What the fuck, lidia? Were you gonna drive like that with our kid? Like what? You're loaded. Oh, is that right? This isn't gonna happen tonight, lidia. Are you gonna test my urine, bertrum? Fuck you, lidia. Come on. You test my urine. I'll piss in your mouth, just like old times. Get outta here. Don't you turn your back on me! Stop it! Daddy's throwing a hissy-fit. You can see your mother when she's sober. Are you fucking insane? Yes, I am! When it comes to my kid, I'm insane. Stop fighting! Well, she's my kid, too. Don't you forget it. You are so fucking arrogant. You walk around like you're Matt Damon, and you can't even get a fucking radio shack commercial. You know why you can't get no radio shack commercial? Because, hola, you can't act. Tiffany, get in the car. You are such a loser. Everybody knows it, even your father. Especially your father. Tiffany! Do not step into that car, young lady! Do it, Tiffany. Tiffany! God damn it, you listen to me when I tell you something! Do not get into that car. You are coming with me! I won't do this to her. It's the last time. I'll get a restraining order. I will restrain you, you faggot fuck! I'll tell the court you molested her! It's ok, baby. You cannot take her away from me! This is kidnapping. You're my angel, baby. I'm gonna come and get you, I swear to god. I love you more than anyone! I'm gonna fucking kill you! Ohh... Wait a minute. I got something in there. [Toilet flushes] Mmm... What, you're on your period? It's really light this time. I'm hardly bleeding. It's not really safe, though, is it? Uhh... I don't have aids, Barry. Yeah. Well, I kinda got a problem with it. I mean, if that's ok with you. Sure. It's not a problem. It's what I get for balling a kid. What's that supposed to mean? Older guys like the blood. Well, then why don't you go fuck an old guy? Hey, don't go away mad. Just... Go away. [Chuckles] Come on, baby, don't go. Look, I'm just in a weird mood. You're so sensitive. I gotta split, anyway. Come on. I said I'm sorry. It's ok. Look, I don't even usually like people doing that to me. [Laughing] Oh, fuck. [Stops whistling abruptly] You've got company. Uh, well, it's ok. Hi, sweetheart. This is...My friend. Ahem. Hi. I was, uh, just on my way out. Tiffany: Who was that? Rachel: The plumber. I tried to call, but it was busy. Yeah, well, we like to keep the phone off the hook around here. Don't we, baby? So, who's the guy? Close personal friend. He's a little underage. Hey. If they're not wearing a retainer... Miranda got a retainer. She did? Her brother put it on Charlotte rampling the cat, and she choked. Stupid pet tricks, huh? Yeah. So, what are you up to tonight? I have this business thing. How's the new job, anyway? It's all right. It's sort of what I'm on my way to now. Fieldwork. Well, it's perfect. She's just what I need. You saved me from a date worse than death. Thanks, Rachel. I'll take her to school in the morning. Give her some of this. It's goldenseal. I think she is on the verge. Are you a woman on the verge? Say "I love you," scheherazade. I love you, scheherazade. Let's build a fire. [Party music playing] Well, there he is. Mr. Go-go. How are you, Jake? Freaky collar. Lou said this would be industry upscale. This crowd look industry upscale to you? Not a policy among 'em. Why don't we go to the peninsula? I'll hang out a while, check it out. So, what happened with the dentist? Did he make a decision? Done deal. You get a commission on that. I didn't do anything. Jake horowitz takes care of his own. By the way, uh... This is a closed gathering. You're not even supposed to be here unless you've HIV. For real? Don't get lucky. Ted Kessler. Hi. First time at the mix? Uh-huh. You had that virgin look. [Chuckles] There's good people here, though. You know we've had 3 weddings in 6 months? Mix 'n' match. Great. Ted, is there a rest room? Um... Thank you. First chill... Then stupor. Then... The letting go. You're free to wash up now. I'm through vomiting. That was Emily Dickinson, wasn't it? Really? You know, she never r.S.V.P.'D. "First chill, then stupor--" but you know Emily. Not as well as you. But I remember her from college. What is your name? Aubrey Jean. I'm bertie. Bertie krohn. I knew that. A little birdie told me. Kind of old to be using a diminutive. Look at Billy Wilder. You look at him. First time at the mix? No. I'm the mix master. I live here. Haven't seen you here before, though. I, um, heard about your parties at a 12-step. The Wilshire church. You know, you're kinda cute. How long have you known? That you're positive? Oh. 6 months. Oh, you're a baby. You? 10 years. So. What's your vocation? What do I do? I, um, work at the museum. Tar pits? Weisenthal. Oh... The holocaust museum. What do you do? Acquisitions. Mommy, I'm sick of all these people. I want to go. You can't go, zeph. It's our house. I don't care. Ooh, hail the crankmeister. Stop it! Ohhh... My kid's just like that. Oh, really? How old? She's 10 now. It's too noisy. Put me in the cone of silence. Oh. Get sma reruns. Nickelodeon. I'll tuck you in. Come on. Ah-choo! Aha. First chill, then stupor, then the letting go, huh? Not funny. Yeah, we had a great showing by a new artist at the gallery. Ha ha. He was just-- Mona: Hell's kitchen... I always thought that was an imaginary place. That's my neighborhood. I'm a street kid. Very evocative, like something out of an American dickens. Do you have siblings? Um, I had a brother. He was killed in a crash. Oh, I'm sorry. No, it's all right. What about your folks? My father's retired. He lives in a little village in the lake district. Wordsworth country. What did he do for a living? He was a watchmaker. Oh. Mm-hmm. Arthritis put an end to that. His specialty was "super-complicated" watches. Ever heard? What are they? Well... First of all, they're entirely mechanical. There's not a digital bone in their bodies. Sacrilege. Perpetual calendar, of course. The thing I like about them the most is that they're what they call "minute repeaters." Meaning...? Meaning they chime. Chime? You mean like church bells? Just press a tiny lever, and they strike the hour and minute. Wow. If your blue matrix fans don't approve, you could always open a watch shop. Well, I am my father's daughter. I'm not so sure that's a good thing. Oh, dear, have I been very boring? Not at all. It's just that... My guess is things around you tend to get "super-complicated." Then he would approve. And do you like complications, commander krohn? I try to avoid them, unless I think there's going to be chimes. But not church bells? I already heard those. Well, I'm looking for a simple watch, sorry to say-- straightforward, dependable. Nothing ornate. A Timex, maybe. Hmm? Something-- something that takes a licking, but keeps on-- oh, dear, you better scratch that. I've got a smooth second hand. Ah, second hand. That's the telling phrase. I'll not take sloppy or sweeping seconds. Rachel: You've got rapunzel hair, you know that? Would you read to me? What would you like to hear? The arabian nights. Pappy reads me Sinbad. How about something from... Leviticus? What's that? Just kidding. I want to hear a witch story. Which witch story? All right. This is going to be very Anne rice. Who's Anne rice? A strange woman who lives in New Orleans. Did you know that a long time ago people believed that women who were having their periods could turn wine into vinegar? Were they witches? Just women. Like you and me. At certain times of the month, if the moon was right, they could dim mirrors and kill crops. And when the moon waned and the tide rolled out, they could drive bees from their hives and cause mares to miscarry. Ooh, I want to have my period. All in good time, my pretty. It was even said such women... Could bring about the death of a man, if she wanted. That's what they believed. Powerful stuff. That's why women soak in a big mikvah when their period stops. A mikvah...? It's a bath...That makes you all clean again. Did you take yours today? Let's go to sleep. Is my mother a witch? I don't think so. Why? She wants pappy to die. Oh, honey, that's not true. She said it to him. People say all kinds of things when they're unhappy. Things they don't mean. I wish you were my mother. Oh, baby, that is so sweet. I want to take a mikvah with you. [Laughs] I'm sorry, Sam. Tell me again. Well, this way we avoid an inheritance tax. You still pay a penalty, but far less of one. And I think we should sell the Jasper Johns. And I think we should get rid of the little rodin at the beach. We can do it through Rachel at, uh, vestries. Why are we talking about this now? Perry: Because now is the time. Why isn't bertie here? I'll tell bertie when I want to tell bertie and not before, and I expect you two to honor that. We can do this another time. No, let's get it done, Sam. I don't want to leave a mess. Are you ok? Fine. Just washing my hands 40 times a day. Classic obsessive-compulsive. Is it time for Prozac, diantha, or is Prozac passé? You just need to rest. You've been overwhelmed. We all have. I don't want to make this just about me. I didn't sleep much. Bertie dropped Tiffany off. So I heard. That awful woman. Why he married her I will never know. Ha! Couldn't have been for the drugs and the sex. He's really gonna die, isn't he? Yes. I can't believe I'm losing a father... Again. [Chimes] How much is this one? Jean-christophe: Le grande complication? 175,000. Platinum is 250. My daughter just got me one for my birthday, but it's not quite as elaborate as this. For the platinum, I'd have to make a few calls to New York. It's really rather plain, isn't it? There are "complications" far plainer than this, sir, at twice the cost. Well, I'm very interested, but I'm just not quite ready to buy. Of course. I think I'll get this gold one, though. The Tiffany. It's a lovely piece. It's from the twenties. It's for my wife. Doesn't chime, does it? I'm afraid not. Shall I wrap it as a gift? Yes, please. You see, the auctions are now open to the public, who are not very wise. I saw a patek which retails at 35,000 go for 38. It retails for 35! It's madness. Pardon, monsieur. [Group sings happy birthday to you] Rachel: Father. Rachel. I brought you a gift. Aren't you going to open it? What is it? It's an eighteenth-century breguet. He was the watchmaker for Napoleon. Breguet called it "the stage four." See the little nodules? Aah! Darling, what is it? It was just a dream. Oh, it's all right. I'm so glad you came. Forgive the mess. There's so much paperwork with this job. What is the job? What is it that you do? We do the tahara... When the family requests. It's a big city. There are only a few of US. We keep busy. I don't know exactly why I'm here. Can I be frank with you? I don't think you're here to talk to me about my painting. My mother's name was bernice. Rabbi gellen was dead set against this, but I had to disagree. I said to myself, "if she comes, I will tell her." She isn't a child. Wh-what is it you know? You said your parents died in a crash. It's not true. What are you saying? Your father... Is he alive? He murdered her. What?! It was common knowledge. He murdered your mother and then took his own life. Liar! I'm asking you not to shout. Let me out. They should have told you. No. Someone should have told you the truth. You said that you sat with my mother. You said you were with her through the night. What did you mean? I washed her. That is the tahara. She was gorgeous. A mouth just like yours. All night I sat beside her. I read the prayers and reminded her of her name so that she wouldn't be confused when she went before god. So Charlie's going on and on about who's going to be there, how we're gonna fly there on the studio jet-- yadda yadda yadda-- and all of a sudden I hear this little voice, you know, coming from inside my head. And it's saying, "hey! "I don't want to go to Aspen for the sixth year in a row. I want to go to St. Bart's." Rachel: Diantha? Uh, Carol, would you excuse me for a moment? Yeah. Rachel? I need to talk. What is it? What's the matter? Is it Perry? Rachel, we always planned on sharing it with you, but by the time you were older-- sharing?! It just feels so punitive, so humiliating. Do you really think you would have wanted all the details, Rachel? Is it any better now that you know? Yes, it's fucking better! Yes, it is, god damn it! It's the old movie-of-the-week cliche, isn't it? The shrink who tells her patients "secrets kill." And here we are, all these years, living a lie. We were trying to protect you, Rachel. We were left behind to deal with the agony your father had created. The shambles. Do you know how close they were? Do you have any idea how many people Leonard disfigured by his selfish act? Perry wanted... We needed to cut the ties to the past. Don't you understand? I understand I was lied to. All the way around. Don't you bring it up with him! I'm telling you not to! [Car engine starts] Rachel, don't you talk to him! [Car drives away] Philip? Jake's here. You won the lotto. [Laughs weakly] How are you? Yesterday was better. Yesterday was definitely better. Philip: As David Bailey once said, "there's nothing as ugly as the sight of 4 men in a car." Maybe 4 men in a car with kaposi. Mister horowitz has brought US a check. Mmm! Loving that. I heard you're planning a little voyage. Who's your sidekick, Jake? That's pretty rude. Horowitz: I'm sorry. Bertie krohn. Perry's boy? Yes. I was the costume designer on blue matri for 5 years. Bertie: Really? You're an actor, aren't you? Occasionally. I'd like a word with mister krohn, sotto voce. I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell your father about this. He'd never forgive me for not coming to him. Your secret is safe. He's one of the few people I know who can make a person feel guilty for not asking for money. It always hurt him that you didn't want to do his show. He knows it's crap on one level. But on another, he's quite proud. Perhaps now... In this "last season"... They canceled blue matrix? Ah, excuse me. Can I help you? Is Perry on the soundstage? Who are you? His son. Oh, he's by the truck, but I think he's in a meeting. Is he expecting you? Perry: This scene is going to need an entire rewrite. Give it to Jack. Bertie? Would you excuse me a moment? Sure. How long have you known? Since my birthday. Does everyone else-- did you tell Rachel? Yes. Ah, Jesus! Why have you kept this from me? I admire you, bertie. I've been a complete failure as a father in so many ways. You haven't been... You've had your problems. But I just--i envy your mind, your facility. You know, if it hadn't been for your mother, I never would have made it through college. I didn't have your quickness. And I think my whole life-- my career in television just embarrassed me somehow. Come on. You have done great work. Look how popular the show is. I wanted to be more for you. I wanted to be a poet. I wanted to be a novelist. I'm over it. You know, when they told me about the cancer, believe it or not, the first thing I thought of was, how am I gonna tell my son? I felt so ashamed. I felt the same way I'd always feel when I'd see you give me that look-- you know that look that I was falling short in your eyes? This is nuts. Once upon a time, an angry man dragged his father along the ground through his own orchard. "Stop!" cried the groaning old man at last. "Stop! I did not drag my father beyond this tree." [Set call bell rings] Did you talk to them? I talked to her. Diantha. She's a therapist. It's funny, the woman's in total denial about being a Jew. I mean, I'm not into it either, but at least I don't pretend to be some presbyterian. We're so different. I talk about myself all the time. She's a professional listener, always in control. Diantha said they didn't tell me because I was too fragile. In grade school I used to hear things-- voices. I called them whispers. They sent me to a shrink. Then later... When I did graduate work in england-- I went to Oxford on a Grant. I know I don't really look the part. I studied coleridge and kabbala before either were hip. And, uh, I had... Uh, kind of a, I guess you could call it a psychotic break. A shattering of the vessels and all that. I was in the hospital for a month. But now... I feel like I'm getting closer to finding out... Can you tell me more about the ritual? We're supposed to do the washing with rainwater or freshly melted snow. Sometimes in southern California that's a little impractical. The skin of the body has always been compared to the parchment of the torah. A body without life is like a damaged scroll. We can't use it anymore. But still we honor it. I would like to learn to do what you did for my mother. So... This is a nice place, huh? I think celebrities come here. Oooh. [Laughs] So, um... What did you want to confess? Um... I've known a lot of people who are... HIV positive, but I am not myself. You're kidding, right? I've lost a lot of people to the disease. I just... When I saw you at the party, I was attracted to you. And when you asked, "how long have you known?" It threw me. Mm-hmm. And I...Suddenly felt like some fucked-up party crasher. I think I was there because I was depressed. Oh, and you thought that... Hanging out with US pozzies might cheer you up, right? That's not what I meant. Mm-hmm. No, I mean, it makes sense, see, 'cause... You're depressed, but, hey, we're dying! So you know... No, I mean, it's ok. I--i--i think that you were probably just... Singles night bottom-feeding, you know. It's ok. It doesn't make you a bad guy. I guess this means you don't work at the weisenthal either, huh? I've been there. Oh, I see. But I don't work there. Ah. I'm an actor. Oh. That's kind of like being HIV, I guess. Jeez, my date with a sociopath. [Laughs] So how long have you been sober? Or is that a lie, too? No, I just took my 5-year chip. Ah, well, people tend to get a little squirrely around 5 years. I know I did. Can I ask you something personal? Mm-hmm. Do you know, uh... Do you know how you got it? Oh, you want me to run my story, huh? Not if you don't feel like it. No, no, if it can help just one person. Um...i had been married. To a lawyer. He did ok. He was... A Tom Hayden-type. We had tried having kids... Forever. It wasn't happening. So, uh, he decided to move onto something a little more... Fertile. Um, I dated around. Met a guy through my brother. I wasn't really looking, but zev--my brother-- pushed it. He felt that I should be with someone, so... Lawrence, uh, was a film editor, a sweet man. He was working on one of my brother's films. Zev is a real Hollywood... Mucky-muck. I was needy, to put it mildly: Sexually, emotionally, whatever. Naturally, I got pregnant right away. Lawrence used to sweat at night. He used to sweat a lot. I thought it was the sex. He was so attracted to me. After he died I found out that he was into men. And he had been with my brother, as it turned out. Jesus. That's why zev matched US up. He was tired of him. Hilarious. Yeah. My brother... Used to torture me when we were kids. Physically. Sometimes I think that zev knew that Lawrence was... My brother is a very sick fuck. [Clears throat] Anyway, Zephyr-- you met Zephyr-- was born negative, so something went right. Care for a pill? They do look sort of appetizing. This one will put hair on your liver. What if it breaks? It's not going to break. What if I take it off? [Sigh] You can't-- you can't take it off. Why? What would happen? Nothing. Would I get it? Come on. No. I like that you have it. Would you give it to me? Bertie, wait. There... There. Come on. Come on. Come on. [Voices...whispering] Fearfully, beautifully made. Fearfully, beautifully made. Fearfully, beautifully made. Fearfully, beautifully made. Fearfully, beautifully made. Fearfully, beautifully made. Darling, i--I'm sorry, I'm losing you. What? Rachel, put your doctor on. Sweetheart, I'm coming. Is my daughter here, Rachel krohn? Darling? Hi. Did you know there are 613 commandments in the Bible? 613. Doesn't that seem a little arbitrary? Rachel, what happened? Well, I don't know. I got sad. I think I had a discharge of blood. Leviticus tells US when a woman bleeds, she shall remain in her impurity for 7 days, and whoever touches her shall be unclean until morning. Anything she lies on during her impurity shall be unclean, and anything she sits on shall be unclean. Isn't that bizarre? Rachel, have you taken anything? Any cocaine, amphetamines? I need to know if you're having a reaction. Excuse me, I'm Dr. Agarwal. Can I have a word? You're the mother? Yes, I'm Dr. Krohn. How do you do? Does she have any history? Well, she had some problems years ago. Is she taking medication? Paxil and Xanax, I think. She complained of spotting. Of course I didn't examine her. It's fairly clear she's decompensating. I think your daughter needs to be hospitalized. I will be the judge of that. Diantha. What is it, baby? Would you take me to trancas? I want to tell you about her. I've been taking classes. Learning how to wash the dead. How's that one for the resume? There's all kinds of rules and regulations. Melanctha says you're supposed to use melted snow. Don't you just love that? Rachel, let's go back. Tap water's a no-no. Tap water makes all the maidens miscarry. It's so trippy. They wrap you in a gorgeous shroud, sewn by the hands of a woman past the age of menopause. Did you know that a woman is considered unclean if when her cycle ends the rabbi finds a stain the size of a circle 19 millimeters in diameter? I'm not making that part up, I swear. Rachel, you need to sleep. Come stay with me a couple of days. I'll take care of you. Diantha, what was she like? My mother? I didn't know her very well. You know what you are? You're a cunt. You didn't like her, did you? She was wild. You never talk about her. Diantha... Did you think she was fearfully, beautifully made? Rachel, I hate to see you this way! I hate to see you! They had an affair, didn't they? My mother and Perry. Diantha, tell me. Did they have an affair? I have to know! Rachel, please-- don't you fucking lie to me! Don't make me tell you. And don't you fucking make me beg! I just want you to tell me. Yes. Tell me! Yes, Perry and your mother were together. They were together. Thank you for sharing. [Door opens and closes] Hi, bertie. I'm so sorry I'm late. It's just been crazy. That's cool. How's your dad? He's well. You know, we just don't get to see him anymore. I'm really glad you could come in. You had a chance to look at the sides? Uh-huh. I was up all night. Ok, let's get to it. From "commander, the instruments are frozen"? Uh, yeah. What page is that? 32. Oh, ok. Commander, the instruments are frozen. Then unfreeze them. Damage report. Very little, sir. Mostly electrical. Warp plasma inducers? Intact. That's what I can't understand. It's as if we're stuck in molasses. Can you bypass? No, sir. We're overheating as it is. Cabin pressure's climbing. Realign the power grid. We've got to shut her down. We're being sucked into a vortex. But how? Who? Who is pulling US? It seems we're being appropriated by a vorbalidian system. Do you know the meaning of it? In vorbalidian rules of conduct, there's only one meaning possible-- it's a declaration of war. Woman: Sharon, I've got joanie. Can you jump on 3? I'll call back. I'm sorry. That was great. I liked your urgency. Let's add another layer. [Whispers] Mommy loves you. Where's Tiffany? Sleepover? She's with a sitter. He's a beautiful boy. Zephyr. Where'd you get the name? There was this train, the California Zephyr. We rode it out here from Chicago when I was a kid. The one with the dome cars? You got it. Tell me something. I know it's a ways off, but... I really need to know. What do you want for Christmas? I want to live. Seriously. I am serious. Why, what do you want? I'll go pick it up for you. What do I want? An idea, with a red ribbon. One big fucking idea that will take me out of myself. Well, that's noble. Why don't you get me... A sickle and a hood? Death by Donna karan. Remember that film where death leads those people in a dance on the hill? Was that babe? The movie with the pig? Bergman. The seventh seal. Bergman's been debunked. And there was this amazing scene-- I think it was in that-- where they burn this woman at the stake. She was very Jean seberg, like a wolf with blonde hair. And the look in her eyes when they set fire to the wood. Christian martyrs are so hot. You joke a lot, you know. This waiter walks up to a horse, he's sitting in a nightclub. He looks at him and he says, "I know I can't make you drink, but you'll have to put on this jacket." It's a little exhausting, plus it makes me...Nervous. Ok, you're right. No more jokes. I've got something very serious. I love you. Don't fuck around. I'm not fucking around. Well... I don't really want to hear your little... Proclamations. Hey, hey, hey, what's wrong? Do you think I have some romantic fucking disease? I don't know what you're raging about here. I just said I loved you. Oh, and this great gift of love you have is just gonna make everything all better. The magic bullet of your cock is just gonna hose all the shit off the sidewalk. Let me tell you something. One day... My son is gonna crawl out of bed, and I'm not gonna be here anymore. Do you understand that? Yeah, I understand. We never talk about it. You ever notice that? You never ask me anything. Did you know that I probably have cmv? I don't know what that is. Right, you don't even know. What is that? You know, I don't know what this is about for you. Is this some surrogate death trip that you're on? Some erotic thriller? I don't want to argue, Aubrey. I don't even know what this is about. What it's about is that I'm gonna go blind in like a month. They're gonna give me a shunt, for meds. And my kid is gonna see mommy walking around the house with a tube in her arm. That's what it's about. I'm sorry, Aubrey. You're sorry?! What the fuck do you want me to say?! God damn it. Motherfucker, motherfucker. Wait, baby, wait. Hold on, hold on. Stay with me. This isn't gonna work. Don't say that, don't say that. What do you want? I want you... To love me. You don't listen. I'll listen, baby. Say it again. Say it. Say it! I love you. Say it again. I love you. I love you. I love you. [Voices whispering] [Telephone rings] [Ring ring] Shit. [Ring] Hello? Yes. Melanctha? I'm sorry I called so late. It's a child. I didn't know until now. I hope it's all right. A child? What happened? A car crash. Not gory. You'll receive a fee for your services. Around $45. Pick a charity, we'll make the donation. That's the way we do it. Melanctha, I don't know if i-- watch me. Follow what I do. You'll be fine. Are you all right? We keep the body covered for dignity. We pour over the sheet. We always begin washing on the right side. We start with the face. No. Baby. [Groans] Aaaah! Rachel, Rachel, don't leave her like that. I can't. Honor this child, Rachel. You don't know. Honor her as you would your mother. Tiffany? How? How, Tiffany? How? If I descend up into heaven, thou art there. If I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the outermost parts of the sea, thou hast possessed my reins. Thou hast covered me in my mother's womb. I will praise thee, for I am fearfully, beautifully made. Marvelous are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well. I've been eating painkillers all week. I haven't talked to anyone, not even Aubrey. I was gonna call you when it happened, but I couldn't. Everything got slow and really strange. I thought if I didn't tell anyone, that I could weather this thing and she might really not be dead. Did you know she was with her mother? Lidia came by, scared the hell out of the baby-sitter. The poor baby-sitter is in pieces. Said she wanted to take Tiffany to dinner. Chuck E. Cheese. She insisted. She was loaded? The coroner said that it would take a couple of weeks yet, for the tests. She planned it. She did it on purpose, for revenge. Oh, bertie. I'm gonna go away for a little while. Where? The desert. I want to go somewhere hot and windy and weird. When are you going? Soon. [Knocks] Aubrey? "Love delivers." [Toilet flushes] Who are you? A friend of Aubrey's. Your name? We know each other? I'm her brother zev. I think you should identify yourself. Are you a cat burglar? Are you the sparkletts man? I'm bertie, bertie krohn. Bertie krohn. Would bertie krohn have any news about my nephew? No. What happened? Aubrey put Zephyr with friends when she went in the hospital. The only trouble is, she didn't say who. Doesn't that blow your mind? Clarissa... 2 minutes. Is she ok? No, she isn't. She's not ok. She is so not ok. What hospital? She's not taking visitors. Look, just tell me where she is. Fuck all that. Would you do me a favor? Let me know if you hear anything about the boy? I'd be grateful. We're very concerned. Really? You can call me at the studio. There's a reward. Yeah. Is rico here? Rico? Waste king? I was looking for Aubrey wicker. Oh, I thought you were the compactor guy. I went to her house. Her brother said she was in the hospital. He wouldn't tell me where. What's your name? Bertie krohn. I'm a friend. Ah, wait a minute, you're the actor. Yeah, she told me about you. Let's go outside and talk. You can watch me smoke a cigarette. We're going black tie tonight. Yet another celebrity-strewn pediatric aids hoedown. The h.I.V.I.P.S just can't get enough. What happened to her? She's toxo. What? Toxoplasmosis. Cranial parasites. She had this fucked-up rash that wouldn't go away. They thought that it was, you know, a side effect of the shit they were giving her for her eyes. And she got pcp pneumonia. Everything just went. What about her kid? The brother-monster wants to raise that boy as an act of demoniac retribution. After Lawrence died, he tried to get custody of zeph. Aubrey knew that the minute she lost it, he would swoop down like some fucked-up monkey god. That's why she took precautions. Where is he? Where-- I love how people think that this disease is, like, over. Where's the boy? Sorry, Dr. Smislow, but I'm really not at Liberty to discuss this. That's from 2001, remember? You know, when the reporters are asking about the quarantine on clavius? Hey, if I hear anything I'll get in touch. I'll call your agent. Ciao. Oh, there she is. That was lovely. [Purrs] Mmm, cat lady. And what's this? That's the funny thing about presents-- you have to open them up to find out. Ok. Oh, god. Oh, Perry, they're painfully beautiful. Thank you. That tiny little girl. It's hard to imagine her being taken away like that. Horrible. You know, bertie was out of town once, and she stayed with US. She had the chicken pox. Diantha and I were away at a concert in Ojai. When we got back we found her standing on the porch, running her hands over a bush. I asked her what she was doing, and she said she'd accidentally ruined a spider web, and she was trying to put it back together before the spider returned. You know what she said? "Well, it's better than coming home to nothing." You know, I bought you something the day after I met you. It's purely on impulse, but, uh, I didn't give it to you. It's a pocket watch. The kind they give for retirement? Yeah, my sentiments exactly. You were going to wait until we did the dirty deed and then present it to me for 50 minutes of loyal service. Do you know what you are? You're a black-hearted Pearl of a girl. Anybody ever told you that? Oh, maybe a vorbalid or 2. Well, I couldn't give it to you. It seems kind of tacky. I don't need anything. Perry, I like you just fine. Well, I'll give it away. Some homeless person's going to be very happy tonight. I adore you. You do? Yes, I do. Thank you for today. Thanks for every day. Thank you. Please take care of yourself. It's been a terrible blow, and you need time to mend. Life goes on. Yeah. I'll see you. Yeah. Ensign rattweil, why have you concealed your royal bloodline from the crew? Was it humility... Or was it overweening pride? Commander, you cannot know what it is like to be born a prince and yet know in your heart that you are not. Rather, you are a foot soldier of mediocre stamina, little ambition, and less vision. In a word, an ensign. That, I have become, and that, I always will be. True. I cannot know how that feels. But nor can you know how it feels to awaken every morning a silly frightened girl who must convince herself she's the commander of a starship. Man: And cut! Thanks, guys. Let's move on. [Sighs] Thank you. Bertie, you got a moment? Perry told me about the tragedy. I'm so sorry. I'm a big fan, by the way. That's very sweet. You know, you're quite good. You really made that scene come alive. He's very happy you're doing the show. Have you known each other awhile? No, not really. But I know how excited he was about your guest-starring because he talked about it. Well, it's been a pleasure. May you wander and wonder with the stars. Wake me for my closeup. [Knocking on door] Man: Bertie! Bertie! [Banging on door] Bertie! You won the lotto. Hey, good to see you. Can I get you anything? I'm cool. A beer, something? When are you coming back to work, sport? Oh, I don't think I can hack it, Jake. Well, it's not for everyone. What's this? It's your commission on the dentist deal. I really appreciate that. You know, whatever you do, you should go back to work. Some kind of work. You don't want to have a lot of free time. I know. I've lost a few people. Thanks for the tip. Take a plane somewhere, spend a few dollars. Go to Greece and look up the boys, huh? Our friend Philip didn't make it that far. He died? Already? Wow. You're gonna love this. Reginald--remember him? The boyfriend? He, uh, took the money, hopped on a concorde with his big black lover to Paris and points beyond. Cold-blooded. Until that happened, Phil was in great shape. See, they always get better after the buyout. It's the money, honey. Pressures ease, spirits rise, a cure's on the horizon. Son of a bitch stole the money. 48 hours later, Philip swallowed a shitload of pills. Overdosed. Did you tell the dentist what happened? Had to. Insurance company's gonna contest the claim. Commission's nonrefundable. What a rat-fuck. Here we were hoping that Philip would die in Greece in Reggie's arms while the sun went down on a ruin, but these are the vagaries of our business. Take care of yourself, Bertram. You change your mind, you give me a call. I'll put you back to work in a left-coast minute. What's a left-coast minute? I have no fuckin' idea. [Door closes] Did you come to see me or diantha? You haven't exactly been cordial since your revelation. I didn't kill anybody, Rachel. No? What's that supposed to mean? I know you slept with my mother. Did diantha tell you that? I understand... Why she kept it from me all these years, to be humiliated like that, then end up co-conspirator. I don't want to judge her. You'll save that for me, huh? She made her decision to stay in this house and lived with the repercussions. But you... I took you in, Rachel. We took you in. Praise the lord. We clothed you and fed you and loved you. How you must have hated him. It's like television strindberg. You fucked his wife and stole his child. You wiped my father off the face of the earth. No, I did not. You disgust me. You still can't talk about it, can you? With everything that's happened this year, you still can't come clean. Your mother was a very unhappy woman. Oh, please. Leonard was not an easy man to live with. He heard voices. Whispers, like you used to. Only with Leonard, they were shouts. Shouts of an obscene, very pissed-off god. They had him on pills. There was a doctor looking after him, a member of the congregation. But his problems weren't paid attention to because he became famous for his singing. His singing was so beautiful, people came to services just to hear him. But he grew possessive of bernice. He started to deteriorate. He accused her of having affairs. You're not going to tell me it didn't happen. She was just all feeling, your mother. Leonard and I married the wrong women, Rachel. Bernice was just too sensitive for Leonard. She needed protection. I didn't. Diantha's talents could have been put to better use. As it is, they were mostly wasted. Did you love her? Diantha? My mother. No. How long did it last between you? We were only together one time. She was desperate. She was gonna leave him, but she wanted to wait till you were born. She didn't feel safe anymore. The one time it happened, she was 6 months pregnant. She had this sweet little belly. That was you inside. Oh, god. I'm sorry. I can't undo what happened. I keep telling myself that things would have ended badly, no matter what choice I made. I have to think that. But there was never any hesitation in doing what we did. We loved you then. We love you now. TV: Ensign rattweil, it was indeed an honor to have been your commander. I shall always think of you as a prince. I thank you for your kindness, commander. You never sat in judgment. It was a privilege to have known you. May you wander... And wonder... With the stars. [Knock on door] Can you keep him for a few days until I make some arrangements? Not a problem. Rico. She's dead? A couple of days ago. I got a call from someone in the brother-monster's office alerting me to her passing. Such a kindness. Listen, I'll take care of Zephyr. The woman who was supposed to take him is in jail. Can you fucking believe it? The fascists put her in jail for sheltering kids. He could stay with me, but the brother-monster's watching my house. The police are into it now. It's serious. Aubrey's being sick was never real to me. She used to bust me on that. I've been telling myself I didn't go see her because I didn't want to be needy. That isn't true. When Tiffany, my little girl, died, I went to this... Dead zone. The landscape where there are no people. You can't say good-bye from there. You can't thank anyone. I mean, it's all just one long good-bye, isn't it? Ciao. Lidia: You cannot take her away from me! You're my angel, baby. I'm gonna come and get you. I swear to god. I love you more than anyone. I'm gonna fucking kill you! Tiffany: Pappy! Oh, god. Rachel washed me in a tub. Bertie... I wanted to say good-bye. First chill, then stupor... Then the letting go. Not funny. Say "I love you," scheherazade. Aah! Mama! Mama! No! It's ok. Mama? Your mama's not here, baby. It's bertie. Where is she? She's with friends. Rico brought you. He'll be back. Where's rico? I want my mama! I know you do. I know. "Stop!" cried the groaning old man, at last. "Stop! I did not drag my father beyond this tree." What's that? Rachel, there's something I never told you. I know what happened to your parents, what your father did. I don't remember exactly how I found out. I guess I overheard something. It was a long time ago. I don't know why I never told you. It doesn't matter, bertie. It doesn't matter. When they told me that Tiffany was dead, I remembered that weird detail about your mother, that they'd washed her. And I wanted that for my little girl. I wanted her to be clean. I wanted... This world to be washed away. Oh, bertie. I was so fucking amazed and glad that you were there. Rachel. If you need anything-- anything-- you better call, promise? I promise. Till you get on your feet. I'll come visit. Find US a ranch so we can ride horses. Stay out of the nuthouse, will ya? Could be tough. Oh, shit! I forgot your present. What? There was a costume designer on dad's show. Phil dagrom. When he died, he left it to dad. Dad gave it to me. It reminds me of her. A Tiffany. Conductor: Everybody aboard! You better go. Last train to clarksville, you know. Rachel... Am I insane? Yes. Come on, zeph. All aboard. If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me. Thou has covered me in my mother's womb, I will praise thee, for I am fearfully, beautifully made. Captioning made possible by lions gate films
