My curiosity with the unknown began when I was a kid staring up at the stars. I would obsess over the concept of whether or not we were alone in the universe. Someone's freaking me out, someone's walking over there. And now my two friends, Jason Mewes and Jamie Kennedy, are coming along with me to investigate. Oh, I see it. I see it. Right here. That is not a satellite. We're talking with experts... It's craziness here that you can't really put into a category. ..searching for the elusive skinwalker... I BLEEP saw a skinwalker. No. Look, and we got it on BLEEP tape. ..and are hellbent to find out if aliens, interdimensional beings, and other unexplained aerial phenomena are real. Alright, guys. I brought you to the Uinta Basin because this whole region, you'll see, you will never go to a place and meet so many people who've had so many paranormal experiences. Most people think "Oh, it's Skinwalker Ranch." It's not, it's this entire basin we're in. Essentially, we're surrounded by all these mountains... Yeah. ..so it's kind of like we're at the lowest point in this, like, valley that we're in. Maybe there's something here and we're on top of it. It would be amazing finding some evidence of a UFO, man. I could see the headlines right now. Yeah, dude. Totally. I've heard numerous theories as to what it is. Some people think that this place is some kind of ley line portal. The way it was described to me is a... You know what a deck hook is on an aircraft carrier? It's those hooks that, when the planes come in and land, it, like, slows the planes down? Yeah, yeah. They say that this is a deck hook for interdimensional travel. Wow. So there's so much magnetic energy here, this is like an entry point into our reality. Oh, dude! Isn't that... You just went so deep, so quick! Love it. People have seen every sort of craft imaginable out here. They've seen the classic saucers out here, they've seen the lights that move really intelligently. Everything happens out here. So, where are you guys at with aliens? I've always been open to them and I totally believe, you know, just like you guys do, and I feel like there's something missing and there's this collective unconsciousness that we want to find out something bigger. Mm-hm. We've all done a lot of cool stuff, you know. Movies and TV shows and it's been great. But I do feel like I'm still searching for this deeper meaning. Yeah. I do feel like if I found something like this, it would make me feel a little bit more whole. Does that make sense? Deep, yeah, yeah. Yeah, dude. It sure does. For me, for anything that's not right up in my face proof, uh, you know, it makes me a little sceptical but I... Really? I feel like it's possible. I feel like why wouldn't there be another planet out there filled with people? I don't believe we're the only ones, I think it's crazy. I think there's nothing unique about life in the universe. I just think we don't know how to find it yet. What do you guys know about Skinwalker? I never heard about it until last month. Really? Yes. And then since then, four times, and then you guys hit me up. Isn't it weird how the world works like that sometimes? Isn't that weird? Yeah. Like, that's just something in the ether right there and it was just like... Totally. ..like you're meant to be here. I know. I don't know about anything about this area, I don't know anything about skinwalkers. You know, of course I know basic UFO stuff. So some of the weird things about Skinwalker that people have reported are UFOs, cryptids, so like weirdass creatures. Obviously skinwalkers, which is a Native American, uh, like a cursed medicine man that will go and torment a rival tribe. There's tons of weird spirit-type things. People have experienced time warps. You name it, it happens here. Wow. Oh, dude, if we could find, like, a way to go back in time, though... We need a time warp. It'd be so sweet, dude. Maybe a time where all of a sudden, we're back at the hotel. 2002 was so much better. Yeah. I'll take the '90s. Let's go for a little ride. Shotgun. Gonna go in the helicopter hopefully to see a bird's eye view of all these places all in one shot from above. Ooh, mic check one two, one two. So we can get an idea of what we're walking into. Yeah. Look at that, dude. Crazy. Um, alright, guys, so like the whole point in why we're doing this is we kind of just thought we'd get an aerial understanding of where we're gonna be investigating. Are we allowed to fly over these areas? Yep. Yep. You know what I'm talking about, though? Oh, I know what you're talking about. We're gonna get buzzed by two F-16s pretty soon. It's vast. So do you guys see why they call it the Basin? 'Cause, like, we're kind of... Like, if you look, we're in the middle of a valley, but it's like the lowest point in the valley. Yeah. Oh, yeah. So we're gonna loop around on, uh, McCoy Flats. This is cool, look at that. Massive. Wow, dude, this is the view. That is wild. Yup, Skinwalker's right here. Oh, look at that big circle right there, guys. Like it looks like... Look at that. It's almost like a big, uh, what are those called? The old-school time dials. Oh, yeah. Yeah. This is all Skinwalker right here. Wow. Yeah, what are the circles for? That's just crop culture? Yeah, just agriculture. Seriously, this is, like, so crazy. Seeing the whole basin from up here. I don't know how we're gonna cover it in just a few days. Well, there you have it, man, we got a bird's eye view. It's very different from the air versus the ground. It's remote out there, there is nothing out there. It doesn't get any cooler than that. No. You know? It's like if I was an alien race, I mean, if you don't want to be seen, then yeah. Yeah, this is a place to not be seen. Yeah, honest to God, it looked kind of peaceful. But it could be one of those things like that's how they suck you in. We got to see these different areas from up high, but now we have to go, I think, put our feet down and investigate. Thank you, sir. Next up, I've set up a phone call with a friend of mine named Jeremy Corbell. Jeremy is an investigative journalist whose kind of area of expertise is UFOs and the high strangeness that comes along with it. So I think it's good to kind of hear his take on things and, you know, Jeremy's a straight shooter. He doesn't deal in the world of paranoia, he doesn't deal in the hysteria that often follows the subject matter. Jeremy Corbell. How are you, sir? Thanks for, uh, taking a minute to chat with us. What's up, Jack? So I'm with Jason Mewes and I'm with Jamie Kennedy, and we are up here in the Uinta Basin. What do you think is going on in the area? The Uinta Basin is a place where the world is thin, where there's a perforation. Credible individuals on a daily basis experience and engage a phenomenon that is not yet well-studied by science. And Skinwalker Ranch was used as a living laboratory. It is currently being used as a living laboratory. The National Institute of Discovery Science and then also the government program were studying and using the ranch. They would set up these interactive games like, you know, jacks and dice and cards, and they would build things and they would look for communication, and they would get responses. There were movements of these objects, and it's all recorded and it's very fascinating. Do you think this place could be... is some kind of weird energy vortex? The Uinta Basin, I don't know what's going on there. But I do know that if you really dig in and you spend a little bit of time, you will see an experience things for yourself that will shake the foundations of what you think reality is. So you believe that there actually is potentially physical danger related to investigating the Uinta Basin? Look. Anywhere you are, there is an element of danger to, uh, looking into the extraordinary. You're entering a zone that really is like the Twilight Zone, where shadow and substance collide. It's mythology, it's physical, tangible things, it's things that we don't know about. It is a place of high strangeness. Every single person, if you can get them to talk, has a personal story or knows somebody that does. Now honestly, it's so much around that area, don't try to pretend like we know what's going on there. When you go there, remember, throughout history, the observer becomes the observed. OK. Yeah, he seems to know a lot, and I assume... It sounded like he's been here. I love that he's saying that everybody here pretty much either has a story or knows someone who has a story. Well, I think we know where we need to go. Yeah. Yeah, let's do it. Let's do it. I'll grab this. You know, it was good chatting with Jeremy and I think it was good for the guys to hear it from him because he's at the forefront of so much information that's coming out about UFOs and extra-terrestrials or interdimensional... Whatever you want to call it. And he gave some pretty interesting points. We're about to pull up to Ryan Burns' property. Um, Ryan Burns, uh, has written a book about Skinwalker and his personal experiences that he's witnessed. He's like an OG Skinwalker investigator. Hm. We're also gonna meet with Ben Hansen, who was in the FBI for a period of time and he's a UFO expert, UFOlogist, and really, uh, has a grasp of what's going on here. Alrighty. Ryan Burns. Ben Hansen. What's up? What's going on, gentlemen? How's it going, my man? Ben, nice to meet you. Jamie. Thanks for having us. Jason. Ben. Alright, guys. Here we are. What have you heard of or what have you seen within the last year on this property? I was with another researcher, very, very good researcher and there was three lights. They were in sort of a formation and they just flashed us, about six feet above us. Yeah, yeah. Woah. And... Make... Did it make a noise? It was totally silent. Wow. It went over a little bluff and we heard kind of a thunk. And we looked up over the crevasse and we could see the puff of smoke or dust where it had landed. And from that spot, it's gonna sound crazy, sort of a amorphous, coagulating, like, bunch of nanoparticles just started spinning, and it turned into a wolf right in front of us. What? Right in front of us, yeah. Hold on. So you saw a large cylinder type of thing and it formulated a wolf, you're saying? Yeah, it was like, if you could picture a bunch of gnats or bees or something... Yeah, yeah, makes sense. ..just spinning and then boom. No way. And then what happened to the wolf? Wait, so then what happened? So you see the wolf, you're like, "Oh my gosh. "Did we see that?" And then what does the wolf do, just run off? We literally came in and, like, we were so freaked out that we, like, hugged each other. At that point, it just sort of unspun and dissipated. Whoa. You know, I signed up for hopefully seeing some blinky lights. I did not think this was part of what it is, and it is, yeah, it is a little terrifying. There's consequences getting to interact with some of these things. It's craziness here that you can't really put into a category. Yeah. Right? You don't get very far telling these stories at parties because people can't grasp the bizarreness that happens. Yeah. Why here? Why the basin? You could go back to the theories of the Native Americans and that perhaps it was a curse that was put on one tribe against another tribe, right, and that the land itself is cursed. Mm-hm, true. Uh, it's anybody's guess. Those are really hard things to test. You know, there are some very unique features that are only found in this, this part of Utah anywhere in the country, really. You could get into theories of portals. In fact, he's got photos of things that look like have opened up and things have walked out of it. That's what I want see. And, you know, I don't know how much you filled the guys in on the craziness here, but one of the rules, of course, is you don't dig, right? Yeah. When you dig, activity heightens. Yeah, it means you probably don't want to be next to an oil rig digging 24/7. What I've heard from the oil workers and some of their girlfriends is that they leave offerings, a sandwich or something so that they don't get messed with. And it works? I guess, I don't know. Wow. Wow. Interesting, interesting. A sandwich. One thing about the basin, right? It seems like there's an energy, when you come here, whatever you come with, whatever emotion you come with, if you come fearful, it amplifies the fear. If you come here, you know, and you're a little more, uh, open and benevolent, it seems like those people don't fare as badly. Are there government agencies out here conducting research? Or is that just conspiracy theory? Well, as you know, Jack, the recent revelation from the DOD was that right, they had the, uh, AATIP program. They put 22 million dollars into, um, looking at unidentified phenomena. That also spun off something else called AAWSAP, which was the Advanced Aerospace Weapons Applications Program, where they were actually trying to make weapons to deal with these advanced threats. So if the government thinks that this is a threat, it's probably a threat. You actually think it's a threat? These aren't just, like, inquisitive beings from somewhere or drones or whatever? It is a bit different than just, say, having a UFO sighting. I mean, you gotta remember what was happening to livestock. Yeah. OK, in the basin. Not just, again, the ranch, a lot of cattle mutilations. Uh, people's livelihoods being destroyed. And whatever this is, if it's multiple things, we don't really know, but it seems to be toying with people. So let me ask you, 'cause you've messed around a lot with this stuff? Too much. Are you cool? No. So you have issues? Yeah. What do you mean, cool? Well, he looks healthy. Don't poke the bear, so to speak. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, but you say stuff happens. I clean up nice, but yeah. It's... Dude, but why? Why, since this is such a trepidatious thing, why do you mess with it? We are dealing with something that might be like an alien artificial intelligence and they're messing with us? I want to know. We want to dive into aliens. Where do we go for that? You guys should go to McCoy Flat. More lights in the sky, more stuff on the ground right now. And that's a really active area, so like Jack says, this stuff, it just moves. It's just constantly moving around. When you say active, like, what has happened in the last week? I was just talking to a guy right over here. He said he goes out there with a lawn chair and a six-pack. He sits down and he says before he has a chance to get to his second beer, the light show starts. Wow. I'm hoping that we find something otherworldly. We'll goof around, but you know, when it comes to this, I'm serious. I'm just an open-minded person. And there's a lot of smoke with aliens, interdimensions, shapeshifters. There's a lot of smoke. I want to find something, you know. As long as it doesn't mess me up. Can we circle up at the end of the week and we'd love to share with you... If we find anything... That would be awesome. Yeah, let's do. Alright. Alright. Let's hit it. It seems like whatever the activity is here, it's all over. And I think Ryan made a really good point that this energy is a trickster energy and it manifests into whatever you fear the most. So that's why I think it's so random, some people fear ghosts, some people fear aliens, some people fear cryptids, and why are they here and why are people seeing them here? Are they actually here or is this energy manifesting into your worst nightmares? 2 00:17:43.560... 00:17:45.640 align: middle line:90% position:50% So we're just getting cameras all set. Check, check, check. We have a whole massive area to cover. Check, check, check. We got it, it's checked. Yeah, we got you, you're checked. Alright, cool. We've got cameras all around us, uh, try and get as much sky as possible. Camera 1 is kind of towards the end of this parking lot area. Number 2 is on top of the hill, 3 is facing kind of towards the moon, and 4 is way down south. Really, this experience is more about us observing the... How's that? Woodchuck to Squirrel, Woodchuck to Squirrel, how's that? Uh, you're looking good, you're coming in loud and clear. Good. Let's do a full-on check. Alright. Alright. Alright, so I've done my fair share of ghost hunts, paranormal investigations, but I've never done, like, an official UFO hunt like this. I mean, I've done some stuff but it's been, like, UFO-adjacent. Well, we like tech too, you know, for what we call skywatching. So I asked Ben Hansen to join us in our investigation because Ben is a professional UFOlogist. He knows how to hunt UFOs. We're gonna try different techniques, he's got some really cool tech we can play with. I've got some cool toys too, so we're just gonna check out this location and see if we get anything, man. This is what I would call my basic setup when I do these things, right? I use this when I fly. Basically, this gives us an aerial view, so if you have anything that we're seeing in the sky, one of the first things I like to do is to eliminate it being a commercial plane of some sort, OK? So... Will that tell you if it's a commercial plane? Every plane that's in the area has to broadcast its data. If you were to see something in the sky and were not sure, we would come to this and we'd say, "OK, well, what is there in the area that's flying around?" Well, right now, there is no air traffic. No. The plane will give its data and it'll say, "Well, that's such and such airline, Flight whatever." Mm-hm. It'll give its altitude, um, its direction, everything will show up here. That's awesome. So that's just one tool. We've got our cameras set up, thanks to you guys, we've got some coverage on the ground. Everyone should have high-powered lights that might come in use later. We've got radios to communicate to each other. I wouldn't recommend that we split up too far. No. Just because of the dangers of everything that's out here. But as we go out, we have got night vision up the wazoo. Jack's brought some, I have some. This is military grade, a new technology called white phosphor which amplifies it about 80,000 times. Holy BLEEP. Wow. Look at the skies. Wow. This is insane. I see so many things in the sky right now, like I know they're probably not, but they look like there's a bunch of resting spaceships. What are those flickering things? Just stars. The night vision is insane. To put those on and just to be able to just see not only far but details. It's like looking in the day. Imagine seeing something coming at you like rawr. I know. So we have the night vision to look up and see... Hopefully we have lights to see where we're going, compasses. Basically tonight, we just want to keep our eyes and ears open, see what's out there, see if we can see anything, right? That's, that's the game plan. Alright, let's do it. Go, fight, win? Yes. Uh, uh, Skinwalker. Skinwalkers! There you go. You got a chair? I'm good. Alright, have we got the night vizh? We got the thermals. Let's go! Not that I know where I'm going, but come on and follow me. Oh, that's good. I think this is good, I like this 'cause it's flat. Alright. Maybe right around here? Alright. Are we all gonna sit in the same spot? Yeah. For now. Oh, OK. The more sky we can see, the better. How about right here? Alrighty. Alright, guys, uh, crew, do you think we can kill the lights so that we can, uh, pull out the night visions? Go IR? I'm seeing something moving! I'm seeing something I cannot identify. Is it moving in a straight line? I don't know. It could be a satellite. Oh, I see something moving. Yes! What is it? Well, I'd say it's a satellite if it keeps moving in a straight line. Straight line? Yeah. It gets smaller, though. That's what happens when things move away. It's kind of fading out. It's fading out. So what happens is they go into the earth's shadow. And they can kind of look like they just disappeared. Yeah, I don't know if I believe that. Oh, what the BLEEP is that? I can see it with my naked eye. No, there's one there. That is not a satellite. 2 00:23:15.040... 00:23:17.520 align: middle line:65% position:50% There's one there too. Where's the other one? Right there on the other side of it, they're going at each other. Yeah, they're going opposite directions. Satellites still. Come on! But you see what I'm saying? You're gonna see a gazillion more satellites than you've ever seen in your life. No, come on, man. Dude. I gotta take these off. Ben, you see something moving, I'm like "Oh, BLEEP what's that?" And he's like, "Well, that looks like Satellite G-75 "'cause what it is is the same track..." Every time I think I see something, he tells me it's not. So I saw something zip, I'm like "What's that?" And he's like "It's just a shooting star." I was like OK. Ben is, uh, he's a little bit of a Benny... What is it, Debbie Downer? So Benny, Benny Bumout. I think it's time that we, uh, have you guys do some sort of manifesting or something. Do, uh, do what you do best and put out your vibes. Come. Come. You know, of course you're getting a vibe of, like, wow, this is extraordinary. Visually, it's unreal and just something I've never seen. I mean, there's so much being thrown at me from beginning to end that it's, you know, it's hard to pinpoint your feelings. Maybe we should try some signalling. We can, uh, use the spotlights. Basically, we're going to introduce ourselves and introduce our intent of what we're here, and then we can all do... Maybe start with the same signal. We'd approach it in the same way as if we were going to a paranormally active house or something. I'd say "My name is Ben Hansen." "My name is Jack." "My name's Jamie Kennedy." "My name's Jason Mewes." "And we're here to document evidence and communicate. "And to establish communication, we have lights "that if we shine these into the sky, into the ground, "if you're able to appear somewhere "that we can see you or signal back, please feel free to do so." Has everyone got their light? Yup. Just point it straight up in the air and then we'll go on, off, on, off, on, off, like three times. OK, here we go. One, two, three. One... Whoops. Two. Gotta cycle through the whole thing, three. Now leave it off. Keep scanning the sky, keep looking down the horizon. As you're looking over there, let's look over this way. So we're signalling again, right? Yep. Two, three. Two. Three. Whoa! What? Crazy BLEEP shooting star. Oh. Huh. That was crazy, though. That didn't look like a shooting star, though. Where? It was right here. It went pshew. It didn't have a trail to it. You know shooting stars will have a trail? It literally just looked like a star just moving without a trail. Was it really fast or semi? Super fast. Oh, you see that light flash? Where? Where? OK. This is really odd. Where? Look where my flashlight is. It's not moving. Holy BLEEP. Oh, crap, come, come on, come on, come on. There it is. There it is. OK, got it, I got it. What the BLEEP is that? I got one, one flash. Oh, I see it again! It's not blinking like a traditional plane. That's weird. Hold on, here comes a plane. OK, I got something coming, but it's... That's a plane. That's a plane we're looking at? Yeah, that's one plane for sure. But that's not what we were just looking at. That's every second. Boom. Boom. Boom. The other one that flashed, it was like flash, one, two, three, four, five, six... It was quite lengthy. Yeah, it was very lengthy. That was not a plane, I don't think, bro. OK, I need someone to reach for my tablet. Right there, Jay. Oh, yeah. I want to make sure this is not a plane. So that's one going this way, that's's going... There's nothing flying away from us. No. Wow, dude. Oh, that's crazy. I feel like we should give another flash. We'll do the flashlight, flash 'em. And then I say we start moving down towards, uh, base camp again. That is a great plan. Let's go. Alright. Who's ready? I'm ready. Three, two, one. Three, two, one. Three, two, one. Why don't I have a light? 'Cause you gave it to me. Alright. Here. You can have my light, Jamie. Well, I'm gonna do it after? And... "Here's a PS!" PS. I'm focused on one thing, helping to spot something out of the ordinary, supernatural, uh, and such. Not worried about other things that could be lurking around, animals or anything crazy like that. So, uh, there's no fear but excitement. It's the excitement and adrenaline being like, "Wow, I think I saw something." Let's move up to the ridge and I feel like if we get up there, then we can see more. Right now I can only see this hilltop. I can't see past it. Sounds like a good plan. Get higher, baby. Alright, I'll fuck with that, Jay. I'll fuck with that. Alright, let's go! Regulators, mount up! Oh, I don't have my chair. Shit. Alright, guys, I found our spot. Wow. Wow. It looks a little flat. I'm into this. Where you going, bro? Hey, bro, it's not cool if you go by yourself. You get bit by a rattlesnake, bro, I'm not sucking the venom out. Dude, this looks so cool in the night vision, what he looks like, look at him. One man on his journey. Here's the deal. I gotta go out alone. I think that would be the way. I think that's the way to see some of this shit. When it knows you're vulnerable. This is the Jamie Kennedy Paranormal Experience. Ha ha, yeah! Yeah, spin-off. What's over here? Where? It's a shack right there. Have you looked through the night vision? I just saw something over here. Really? Where's our... No, the campground's right there, bro. Campground's here. Holy crap, there's something back there, dude. 2 00:30:47.320... 00:30:49.960 align: middle line:65% position:50% There was something back here, just turned on and turned off. The beam... Was it like a visible light? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It had a light looking at us and when I went like this, it saw me put the pointer on it and it turned its light off. I'm looking through the thermal and I'm not seeing anyone. No? Whoa, dude. That's crazy, then. I would see someone moving around if there was someone out there. Right there's our campground, 'cause look at our campground, see how there's a light? Are you fucking serious? Right here. OK, I just saw another blink. There's another blink. Turn your light off. Over there? Oh, oh, oh. Hold on, turn your light off. Right in that same area, there was a slight blink. Yup, yup. It's not coming up on thermal, whatever the fuck that is. It blinked and then... Right there. It's, like, travelling. Whatever it is not giving off any heat signature, so it's not someone out there, I would see them. It looked like they were just standing there watching us, and then when I put my pointer towards it, it was like, "Turn off the light, shoot." I thought it was our base camp. That's crazy, see? The observers become the observed. I got, like, two flashes before it disappeared. Dude, I don't know, this is weird. If it is aware of us and it's curious about us... Yeah. ..so far, it's been at quite a distance. It's almost like it's kind of circling us but it wouldn't have to turn on a light if it didn't want to, right? We're assuming. Yeah. It's almost like it wanted you to see that. And it was some kind of light, some kind of... This middle of this area where there's definitely no roads, so it definitely wasn't a car, it wasn't a motorcycle, it was... And it wasn't anybody from the crew. Like, I can't explain that and it was definitely something very, very strange. What, four or five witnesses? Like, that's pretty significant. If someone was messing with us, your thermal should've picked up on it. Yeah, didn't. And there was, there's nobody out there and it looked like it was moving faster than a person could be running in the dark over this terrain, so it was, it was very weird. So I think we should, uh, maybe call it for the night. Start reviewing some of the footage, seeing if any of the stationary cameras picked up anything. Yes. And, uh, reconvene about tomorrow. Sounds like a plan. I like it, and we can go through all of the, uh, items we have and see if we want to bring anything different, uh, tomorrow. Alright. Let's go! Uh, my first, like, real UFO investigation, um, pretty interesting. You know, we got some results. I think the tactic moving forward is to kind of keep it along the same. You know, we've gotta interview witnesses, we gotta find great locations to go investigate, and we gotta post up and watch the skies. Hey, guys, check this out. So at the 45 second mark, look right here. See this odd blip. See that? Oh, wow, yeah. We did catch it, this is what we were seeing down here in the valley. Yes. And we were concerned that we didn't catch it. The fact that you reacted at the same time... Yeah. ..tells me that it wasn't an insect right in front of the camera here because it was seen down below us. 100 percent, and you can even see me look. I look, 'cause I'm like "Oh, that's the camp," and I'm like, "Wait, no, there's the camp." We had the night vision and we didn't see anything around, so it couldn't have been someone driving a bicycle or anything. Mm-hm. And other people saw it, so I wasn't seeing things. Well, and the fact that it was kind of flared up, you know, from the camera's point of view here tells me it was actually pretty bright, because it looks like it's happening just right there in the sage, but it's really down in the valley. Yeah. So it's pretty big. So look at this. I found this really interesting. We saw lights that were pulsing. Yes. Yep. So tell me when you see it flash. Right there. Yep. OK. Now watch again nearby, there it goes again. Oh! Yep, yep. OK. Each time it flashes, it's slightly moving. Mm-hm. The easiest explanation is it's gonna be... It's a plane. But most anti-collision lights on planes don't just do single strobe, they'll do like a double strobe. You at least have... Have to have your beacon on, which is normally red and that's like a steady pulse, right? OK. So I'm gonna put it in my box of "Ehh, interesting, interesting." I like it, I like it, as long as you got a box for that. To me it's still exciting. This is just the first day, so... Yeah. So I'm really excited, 'cause we got that on video. And I wish it was a little bit clearer, but hey, beggars can't be choosers. And I know in the area that we even see on video, which is great, it was a big open field like this, so it wasn't a road, it didn't happen to be a fast passing car. This absolutely correlates with the activity that Ryan was discussing yesterday with the strange light anomalies. I was actually expecting, uh, less. I didn't think we caught anything when, uh, Jay saw that mysterious light. Um, so I was pleased that we got something, I mean, I'm not 100 percent sure that that is the light he saw, but there is some strange flare going on. Was it definitively a UFO? Can't say. But is it anomalous? Yup. Well, I think it's important that we continue meeting people, hearing these eyewitness testimonies. I love adventure. Searching for things unknown is an adventure. And I hope we can avoid the negative things and just enjoy the company, uh, of Jack and Jamie and myself and all the people we meet and get to hear what they have to say. So we just got done reviewing some evidence. Um, so now it's time to talk to locals. We want to canvass the basin and get as many witness accounts as possible to help us figure out what our next moves are in this investigation. Why are we meeting out here? You're now here to show you some areas of the oil field that, uh, scare the crap out of me. It's 108. Yeah. It's 108 degrees out. We couldn't meet in your garage? No. OK. You gotta live it. I've been prior law enforcement, retired, uh, private investigations after that. Having had a background in anthropology and archaeology, I decided to melt the two together and investigate things that dealt with, uh, ancient uh, historical data that was lost and a lot of the unexplainable that goes along with that. I live in East Carbon, Utah, and I've had rather unusual experiences with, uh, non-human entities. OK. I'm a tribal member of the Uintah and Ouray Indian reservation here, which encompasses over two and a half million acres. I'm also part of the, uh, Lakota nation from up in North and South Dakota. We've always known about this, uh, the Skinwalker Ranch area. Actually, it's burial grounds around all those cliffs around it, so that whole area was known as kind of, I wouldn't say evil, but there was a negative force. First time I ever saw a skinwalker was out here. A skinwalker? Yeah. What did it look like? I backed up my truck to the well. I had the lights on on the truck so you could see. And as I looked through the mirror behind my truck, this thing was underneath my truck, so I sort of peeked through the mirror. This thing stands up from underneath the truck, puts its hand on there, and looks right at the mirror. Well, the truck sits about 12 feet up from the trailer. It's probably two feet under that. So when it stood up, it stood straight up and it looked like a fox, his face. But its eyes were brilliant blue. Wow. The way you did that was, like... Yeah. It stood up. Manny. Yeah. Like, it's... Well, how do you know it's a skinwalker? Another way to tell, it's a wolf-looking thing. A wolf? Wolf, fox, coyote. It had the face of a coyote, almost. Like Wile E. Coyote? Yeah, like Wile E. Coyote. For the last several years, I'd been focusing on the petroglyphs and pictographs that are in this area. Those really do fascinate me because it's just so amazing that people, like, sat and drew stories out on the wall and they are there for so long. What's crazy to hear is it looks like you're watching a horror movie. Yeah. Or science fiction movie. And there's aerial phenomena that you can see. In Nine Mile Canyon, you have what look to be UFOs with aliens and it's showing uplift, it's showing stuff coming out of it. There is a spot where there are 26 different figures coming out, five species out of what looks to be a portal. 2 00:39:56.200... 00:39:58.600 align: middle 50% When was the last time you had, uh, an encounter with a non-human entity? This orb has been following me ever since my first encounter with this entity. In 2008, I started having these visitations from a non-human humanoid-type being. Could you describe what it looked like? Yeah. He was dark brown. He had a large cranium with three, uh, ridges that had one main ridge in the centre of the skull and then one smaller one on each side. Uh, he had large black... They weren't the typical oval eyes. These were more round. But they were like four or five times bigger than a human. He had a very narrow, petite chin. He was about five and a half foot tall. He had a very small mouth, he never talked. The only time he had talked, it was done telepathically. Wow. We were always told to stay away from this river, stay away from these cliffs. You know, stay away from all this area. And especially at night, you know. And in regards to skinwalkers, I'll just say I have no beef with them, just so they know I have no beef with them. I feed 'em, I take 'em offerings, I joke, I tease. They like it when you're happy, but any... I'd say that too. But anyhow... You should put that out there, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yes, absolutely. What was another experience you had? If you look back behind you, Skinwalker Ranch is right back there. I had three UFOs come out of that area right there, three glowing amber lights come up, and then they all sort of moved to the right, basically going east. It flew probably a good 30, 40 yards out. It pulled up, went next to each other like this, and then spun this way, whsst. This and then just... They disappeared, they just turned into dots and poof, gone. And then, hyperspeeded? Yeah, I don't know if hyperspeed, but it disappeared. Wow. Really? Yeah. How come I never get to see this shit? We're at, uh, Bottle Hollow Reservoir, and the history behind this reservoir is just intense. This place was filled in by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1970, but before that, it was a canyon that had supposed strange occurrences. Um, UFOs had been seen. I'll show you a photo. This is before the water was, uh, filled in to the canyon and turned into a reservoir. What you're looking at, there is a location that would be right over here, right where we're at. OK. Mm-hm. And it looks like there was a huge runway. Yeah, yeah, yeah. In the ground. And I... I see that right there on top, yeah. Yeah, it looks to have been a huge runway leading right into the canyon wall just on the other side. The roads have been created, uh, by the Ute tribe in what looks to be, uh, geoglyphs. It's these huge circles that are in these patterns that can, guess what? Only be seen from the air. Wow. And it's massive. And guess where it's at? It's right on the other side of where this runway used to be. What have you seen? You seem like you've got a wealth of alien knowledge? I've seen quite a bit here in the basin. One that comes to mind that was unforgettable for me was I have this feeling to go for a drive one night, end up in, uh, Wolf Creek Pass. And I notice this light up on the ridge. It started to move along this ridge line. Did this for, like, 15 minutes, it was pretty slow. And then it zipped back to its original spot and then just went shoop, like to nothing. It was almost like it powered down. And then in that same spot, it started to, like, build back up energy or something. That's when I got the one picture. Oh, OK. Ooh. I got it when it was powering back up, but you can see the shape of it. The last time I had an encounter with him, he came and after a while, what seemed like a couple minutes, everything turned to fuzzy white and I passed out. And I came to, I was lying face down on a, uh, what looked like a stainless steel table and the room was full of these entities. And there was also humans in there wearing white lab coats. Do you think that the drilling has anything to do with it? They say once you dig in the earth, the earth digs into you. Well, could be. Could be a way of trying to get people to stop drilling. But I'm not for sure on that. 'Cause it is land that was somebody else's before ours. Do you feel that it's, like, a Native American spiritual thing happening, or do you think it's otherworldly? I think it's more otherworldly. I purchased several different magnetometers, which reads the magnetic level of the earth's centre at a specific location on the land. I went through this basin and took hundreds of data points, which took weeks. I came across three magnetic atypical readings, which were so phenomenal. These three magnetic readings were down to a negative 14 microtesla all the way up to about a 50 microtesla. So we're getting these reads that are going from a negative 14 all the way up to about 50, that should never happen. Yeah, yeah. Unless we're coming up against an atypical magnetic structure or... Where you know, or maybe some places you do know and you're like, "Oh, look, here's something, "there's something built under." Like if someone has a bomb shelter, you might get a reading like that, right? You would absolutely, because there's less of that space in between the centre of the earth to where we are on the top. OK. But to get this constant flux... Yeah. ..it should never happen, no matter where we are. Unless something massive is underground, like some type of device or a craft or some type of vehicle or, uh, an underground building or structure that we're just not aware of. And all three of these readings were in a diagonal, perfectly straight line at 8.34 degrees, and it runs right through the centre of Skinwalker Ranch. All these experiences, have they stuck with you? They stick to me to the point that I don't like being out here alone at night in the oil field anymore. So what do you do? Working days now, so I don't have to come out here at night. Definitely don't get creeped out anymore, 'cause as you see, you can see for miles. Nothing's gonna creep you out here during the day. So that's why you wanted to meet during the day? Yeah. It's a lot easier. You come out here, you don't feel that weird presence at night. Really? Yeah. I think it's kind of peaceful, I think. It is peaceful until you get out there. Especially if you had experience, you get out there and you're like "OK, I know there's stuff out here," so you're on edge. So this is real, this has got you freaked out, huh? Yeah. Creeps me out. Till you lived through it, you don't know. There's a lot more stuff going on instead of just here. Out towards Fantasy Canyon and out towards the east, out those wells towards Colorado, there's a lot of stuff still out more that way. Fantasy... Fantasy Canyon. Yep. So after talking to these guys, I feel that, you know, they definitely shed some light on things. It's all just more evidence of what we're doing, more accounts of situations, more proof, more things that are, you know, it just adds value to what, uh, we're here. It just brings the excitement to what we're doing here. Manny said the place to go was Fantasy Canyon. And I, you know, with all respect, I haven't seen anything yet. So, gotta go to Fantasy Canyon and see what is up. 2 00:48:38.840... 00:48:40.600 align: middle 50% Are we doing this? Alright, gents, Fantasy Canyon. Who interviewed the dude that was like, "Fantasy Canyon is the shit"? I did. Yeah, yeah. So he said that's where he sees the most crazy stuff. What kind of stuff did he say he witnessed out there? Uh, skinwalker was in his truck. Uh... In his truck? Yeah, behind the chains. What?! Uh, a little bit of fox with blue eyes. This sounds like this is gonna be the spot, right here. Did he feel like people should be fearful of their own safety? Yeah, he said he was very scared and he said he saw things that just looked very, very, very frightening to him. And always alone. Always alone. So that's the thing is, we're gonna have to split up. But what if we don't split up, 'cause I'm afraid to split up, so what if I, like, get on your shoulders and you wear, like, a trenchcoat? Mm-hm. And we look like a really tall person. All three of us could do it. Done. I did think it was very ominous, what Jeremy was saying about if you're looking for something, it will be looking back at you. Remember, throughout history, the observer becomes the observed. You're not frightened, James? Dude, it's eerie. It can be eerie. If we came face to face with something, we'd be getting observed, hopefully only observed and not bum-rushed. Mm-hm. We'll try to, uh, be very quiet. Yeah, I think silence, silence is gonna be golden in this. Yeah, Ben is not with us tonight, where it's just us. We're gonna just be out there with a childlike sense of wonder. You got the stuff. We got all the stuff. You got the night goggles, right? Yep. Yeah, you got the goodies. Yep. The training wheels are off and we're ready to go. I'm in. We have to do one of these, bro. One, two, three, skinwalker. Yo. Fantasy Canyon, here we come, my friends. Ooh, I love how we're all talking about, like, the craziness and it just gets dark and gloomy. Already I feel like just, just travelling here... Feels weird. Different, right? Different. Fucking wild. Whoa! That lightning! Yeah, look at this. Look at these rocks, man. This is wild. Ahh! Look at that. Ahh! This is, like, dinosaurs. Whoa! Shizzle. That was fucking nuts! Yeah, dude. It's lightning. The fact that as soon as we started our drive to Fantasy Canyon, the weather went from, like, 100 degrees and clear to all of a sudden thunderstorms is concerning. It's like something doesn't want us out here tonight. I just thought I saw something, like, running alongside of us. Shut the fuck up. I swear, I'm not kidding. Are you serious? I'm looking, I'm looking, though. Like up on the ridge? Right where... It's where that barrel is. Like, that deep. But I swear when I looked over, I saw something, like, hauling ass with us. Here we go, look, Fantasy Canyon. Ain't no cell service out here, boys. Shit. This is like the type of shit where shit will pop out from a rock, I'm serious. Alright, boys. We're here, boys, let's go. Ooh, this is weird. Wow. Alright, so here's the plan. We've got all sorts of gear, everything from ghost gear to, like, high-level night vision and thermal. Alright, let me see here. Radar. Yeah. You see something moving, we blast it. Ba-dew. And we'll see if we can get it. You're bringing the machete? Dude, I'm bringing this because if we come face to face with one of these things, respect, but... Fair enough. This was such a great... Ooh, that's good. Yeah. I mean, you can hear a bee fart with this. One of your farts. Oh, you don't need this. Bro. We got these, I'm gonna take these, thank you. I think this is what you're looking for, young man. Oh, hell yeah. Is this what you're looking for? Those are what you're looking for. These are what you need. The golden goose. Alrighty. Got that, I got my flashlight. Yeah, I got my light, my laser, my night vision. The vibe in itself is just, you know, you get a feeling, like a different feeling of something... Something's watching you or something's around. Like I don't know, but I just, it feels that way, you start to feel like, it's just unreal. Is this where we're doing the offering? Put that right in the circle. Right here in the circle. I don't know if we just, like, leave a can and leave a pack of smokes. Let's get the machete, bro. Try to chop the can right in half. You really want to do that? Yeah. We gotta open it for 'em. Are you kidding me? No, I'm not kidding. Give it a skippity-bop-bop. What if they don't have the technology to open up a can? I think that's stupid. Alright, you gonna give it a chop? But you can do it. You want me to chop it? Have at it, friend. Alright. This is for y'all and all who might like it. Should I go for it? You ready? Do it. Oh... Look at that. Look at that. Like a glove. Yeah. I know you... It's open now, bro. "I know you're from another galaxy, let me give you some dented corn." OK, there we go. Corny love. There we go! There we go, exactly, now. That knife is sharp as hell, bro. There is thy corn. Here's some tobacco, here's some corn. We mean no disrespect. No disrespect. I don't know, Jay throws a pack of Marlboro reds in there and fucking corn from Costco? It's like Jesus Christ, and then he, like, opens it, like fucking janky style and cuts it in half. I think that was a little... That was, like, disrespectful to the spirits. Um, so hopefully they don't get pissed off. Let's go. This is some of the craziest rocks I've ever seen, whoa, it is slippery up here, boys. Ho-ho, shit. This is insane. This is one of the craziest looking places I've ever seen. I feel like the energy here's a different energy from where we were. Yeah. We should trek up there. OK. 2 00:55:29.600... 00:55:31.720 align: middle line:90% position:50% We should cruise in, we should find a good vantage point. Yeah. On, like, a hilltop and we should just hunker down. Ooh, alright, I think this is the good spot. Alright, here we go. Oh. Yeah, baby. Alright, guys, let's do, like, a bit of an intention. We left you guys, uh, an offering. Let's just sit here for a minute. If you look that way, Jack... Yeah. ..there's something blinking on the horizon. Oh, yeah. You see that? Yeah. There's two things. What is that? It's not a plane. This one isn't. That's blinking big time, right? The one underneath, but it's not moving. It's all over the place. It's erratic. It's erratic. That's super erratic. I'm gonna track it for a little bit. Yeah, dude, it's moving, but barely. Like... Yeah. Look at the... Look at on both sides, those aren't moving. No. You think they're stars? I don't know. Wait, the other one is starting to go up in the air, dude. So is that the bottom moving right now? It's going up. That... it's weird. The blinking's gone. The blinking has gone. I'd rather see a craft right now than a creature. Mm. To be real with you. You know? Yeah. I feel like this would be, like, where creatures would, like... Hide out. Yeah, right? Whoa. What is that? Do you see the little black? Yeah. OK. Now watch. It seems like it didn't move. But after Jay puts his light there, there's nothing there. Right, I'm gonna put the light up, watch out. OK, three, two, one, go. Huh. Now turn it off. It's so weird! Yeah, right? What the fuck? Right? That's so weird. It's something black there. Not moving. It could be a crevasse and that way, we are a shadow. Yeah. It's so weird. I know. See it there? Yeah. And now it's gone. It's like when you observe it, it's gone. Through the night vision, when we looked across these canyons, it looked like someone was stood there, and then when you shine the flashlight, there was nothing there. I don't know, it's really odd. 2 00:58:56.240... 00:58:58.640 align: middle line:65% position:50% Alright. Let's, uh, let's go off on our own. So the three of are gonna separate and go our kind of own ways and do some bit of exploring around. Apparently skinwalkers only tend to show up when you're alone. I'm gonna post up. I'm gonna try to listen. Brr. Oh, shit. Like, what makes something out of straw that's in this kind of weather? Dude, there's something else that's been in here. Oh, shit, dude. Oh, shit, dude. There could be hundreds in here, we better get out of here. I never seen a real bat. Or what if it's a shapeshifter, bro? Straight up. There's a feeling that it's not just animals. It could be many things. Now whose tracks are these? Now look at this clay. That's grey and that's red. Like something was burned or it bled out. Is this blood? There's streaks of red all over these mountains. Fascinating. Oh, shit. This looks like some kind of graveyard from back in the day. Look at that one. That's like Transylvania or some shit. What if this is more than aliens? What if this is vampires? Oh, shit. Shit. Look at this. It goes deep in there. That hole keeps going. Damn, that's like a total hiding spot. This is intense. There's something out here, I don't know what. Oh, fuck. Something just freaked me out, someone's walking over there. Who's over there? Look. You see? Who is that? Must be one of us, 'cause they're walking towards the cars. No, he just fucking turned. Now they're running. Whoever the fuck they're... Who is that? Now he's running full belt. You can see them, right? Holy fuck, dude. They just walked over the ridge. Who the BLEEP is that? I literally just watched someone come from behind the hill and I thought it was one of our crew. And it's like oh, he's going towards the cars. Must be one of us, 'cause they're walking towards the cars. No, he just fucking turned. Now they're running. And he just fucking kept running and they're, like, somewhere in this region here. That was fucking weird. Who the fuck was that?! We need to go find whoever the fuck that is. Did I just see a fucking skinwalker? OK, it was on the other side of this. They were in this, like, gully right here. It stopped here. And then it took off this way and started running. And you see this little berm right here? It went over this, whoever it was. Here we go, look, look. Footprints. Look, see? I told you, they were running. OK, another one here, here. Here. Who the fuck was this? Dude, I think we saw a fucking skinwalker, bro. 2 01:03:45.960... 01:03:48.320 align: middle line:65% position:50% Can you radio and tell everyone to come back to base camp? He says... We're coming! Jamie. Yeah. You guys aren't gonna fucking believe me when I tell you this shit. Dude, I swear to God, I fucking saw a skinwalker. No! And we... And we got it on fucking tape, dude. No! Dude. Dude, I'm like... I saw some crazy shit, but... Dude, there's fucking footprints. Put it on something. Dude, our corn and tobacco offerings actually worked! Jay, watch where you're stepping, because there's tracks here. Dude, I fucking shit do not, I think I fucking saw a skinwalker. Wait, what? I'm up here on the ridge, I'm looking through this. I see someone come marching around this bend, you see how the hills curves down here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And there's this gully. I see someone... But dude, I'm talking, like, doing this shit, like fucking marching. And I'm like, "Who the fuck is that?" And I thought "Oh, is it maybe, I don't know, "is it one of the producers coming back to get a battery or whatever?" He starts walking and I see he stops 'cause he sees the cars. Yeah. And there's no head torch. And you know how fucking dark it is right now? Yeah. He pivots and starts running. Look at these footprints right here, dude. Is it a fucking hiker? Dude, he starts fucking running. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can see. Look here. This isn't a big foot, this is like a Size 7 foot. Yeah. OK, well, let's follow it. I did and it ends. Look. Look how light they are too, some of them. He comes belting through here. But dude, where did he go?! Is he going in, like, circles right here and disappear? And he comes through here, Jay. Wow. And he comes down right here, right where you're walking. Yeah. I don't see more footprints. Here, I'll show you where... Here's a footprint here. So this is my foot. But I, dude, I got here five minutes after. Yeah. And I'm fucking scanning everywhere and I can't see anyone. No, it's empty, it's empty. They may have gone to this oil thing over here. We got him on tape, by the way. I want to see that. We have to play that back. It must be one of us 'cause they're walking towards the cars. No, he just fucking turned. Now they're running. Well, guys, listen, we gotta get back and review this. I mean, I've been looking for this for a long time now. I'm guessing we probably spooked it. The observers become the observed. We're gonna play it back and you're gonna see. You're going to see. Wow. If this evidence is something unexplainable, this is, like, the crown jewel. Unbelievable. So last night, we captured some pretty legit evidence. I'm very excited to share it with Jay and Jamie. Apparently they found some stuff too, we kind of split up all the stuff and, you know, reviewed amongst ourselves. But yeah, we got some good stuff. Alright. Alright, alright, alright. Wow. Alright, my friend. I'm excited because I know you got something to show and I know we got something to show. Oh, we do? So, uh, Jamie and I last night, uh, went over, through some footage from the stationary cameras we had placed. I feel we got something a little odd and you really have to look right here, OK? So you see this shadowy figure, uh, thing right there. Yeah. Right now it looks like a shadowy maybe piece of rock or something. But if you stare right at that shadow... Stare at it. Shadow. Huh, it, like, fades away. Yeah. It just goes away. But it was, like, standing there, standing there. And then there's a light. And then all of a sudden, some... Almost like it saw someone coming, it said... Yeah. Holy shit. That was a, like, it looks like a silhouette. Yep. Right? Yeah, even a little head, you can even see it right there. Yeah, and then it looks like it moves there and then vanishes. Whoa. So no one was in this area and it's way up there, so. That's so weird. What do you think that is? Do you think that, that is potentially a spirit? Do you think that's an alien? Do you think it's cryptid? What do you think that is? I don't, I don't even want to try to figure out what it might be except for something awesome. Because any of those things you mentioned would be awesome, but it's... I feel like it, it is something. So again, I don't want to speculate 'cause I feel like if it was an alien, an alien has some kind of, uh, luminescence glow or some kind of, something sexy. In my brain. OK. You know? Skinwalker, I feel like, would move different. Mm-hm. You know? I feel like this is almost, yeah, more of a shaman spirit, like he just sort of was like... Like hovering. And yeah, just sort of fiddles, fizzles away. OK. That looks like a person. It looks like a person stood there with his arms down by his side and just kind of like, checking shit out. Was creeping, yeah. Remember we saw the black figure? Yeah. And then when we put light on it, it wasn't there? That's a kind of a version of that, yeah? Yeah, last night, when we were back there looking over and over about it, I agree. It's definitely something that's not there when it's there. Alright, guys. Are you ready to see? I'm ready to see the creme de la creme of the crop. I mean, that's not bad, what we found. That is not bad. I think it's good, yeah. And that is a solid find. Yeah. Alright, gents. Brace yourselves. 2 01:10:17.520... 01:10:20.640 align: middle 50% Brace yourselves. OK. Whoa, whoa, whoa! I see him! Oh, shit. What the fuck! Oh, shit! Look at how fucking fast he's moving too. Ohh, shit! No head torch, nothing. Look, and now he's going over. Wait, why, he... Go back, go back. Go back, you bastich. I see him right, right there. Look how fast he's moving, dude, nobody moves that fast. You're right, he totally saw the cars and went this way and went... Yeah. Yeah. I thought he just went a beeline. No. He, like, is beelining it, and then he sees and the he's like "Whoop!" And then over that pass. No, but the dude literally was like... Yeah, but our crew wasn't... Oh, shit, a minivan. And then... That's why I'm saying, he wouldn't have left. What the fuck? Skinwalker, dude. Dude, that's so bizarre. That's an entity with no... Now.. ..stuff on. No lights. That guy walking is pretty crazy. Did it look, like, webbed or winged or anything like that? No. But 1:45 in the morning, disappears like, there's definitely smoke. There's a lot of smoke. I haven't seen fire yet but a lot of smoke. We should pop back over there first. Yeah. And see if we can follow where his tracks went. Yeah. Let's do that. And then I think we should start going back to where he came from. So now that the sun's up, I want to recheck the area that we saw this figure walking through. Hopefully we can get a better idea of if it is or isn't a skinwalker. Have you ever had anything like that? I've never captured anything like that. You've never captured an entity? Not like that. You're welcome. OK, so he kind of gets to here and then he beelines it up. So we know, remember, we found his prints here last night. Yeah. But it rained some more. So... Walk in each other's prints. But yeah, we also gotta fan out and see if we can see where he came up. Was this it? Yeah, this was it. Now look, there's tracks down here. Yeah, this is where we came. So we were all walking around here last night. There is footprints here. I think he would've gone, continued this way on here. What are these? There's prints here. A print here. A print there. He came through here. Yeah. Yeah. He came this way. Yeah. Whatever it is. That's a big print. Jamie, he came this way. How do you know? 'Cause I'm seeing, I'm seeing, like, footprints. Here, look here. Boom. Here, footprint. Here, here. He came through here. I want to do our test, I want to... I want to get someone to run. Yeah. Let's see what it looks like, see how fast we can go. OK. I was right here. Now, Anthony, can you hear me? OK, I need you to head in, into the canyon more. Keep going. Right there. OK, hold on. This is where you first saw him? I saw him come from right where Anthony is. Alright, think Bigfoot style power walk. So I timed the video and it takes that figure 10 seconds to cover this distance. Alright. Start now. Now! In my head... That's 10. Yeah, I have 10 too, yup. And boom, stop. 15 seconds. So 15, 16 seconds almost. Five seconds. Yeah, I mean, the other guy was hauling butt, dude. Whatever, whoever, whatever that was, it was hauling almost... Pretty quick. Yeah. I mean, if he was a lot taller. 'Cause he's moving pretty fast. Yeah, but look. Let's, let's see if we can sync this up. OK. He's definitely not running. I think for me, I would love to show this to Ryan and see if he's ever seen anything like this. I know he has seen skinwalkers. I would, I would love to show it to him, like, "Hey, is this anything you've seen?" Yeah. "Is it common to see random people roaming around Fantasy Canyon "at 1:30 in the morning?" No, yeah, yeah. And moving that speed. There, there's no sense... He was like, trying his hardest to move that fast. Yeah. Alright, let's head back, Ryan's gonna meet us pretty soon and I want to show the footage to him and get his opinion. Yeah. 2 01:16:01.200... 01:16:03.160 align: middle 50% Here he is. There he is. Look at that, you could see that van from a mile away. Spacewolf. Ryan Burns. Here comes Spacewolf. What's up, dude? How's it going, guys? Good to see you. The most well-dressed man in the basin. Really, that's a great vibe, bro. Thanks, man. I love it. We got some stuff. Oh, I'm excited. Let's start with Night 1 when we were out at McCoy Flats with Ben. We were just getting started and we saw something flashing in the sky. Oh. You see that light flash? Where? Where? This is really odd. Where? Look where my flashlight is. It's not moving. Holy shit. You got it? What the BLEEP is that? I got one flash. Oh, I see it again! It looked like a satellite but it wasn't moving, and it was just pulsating and then it stopped. Later, we saw another light moving across the flats. Holy crap, there's something back there, dude. It's not coming up on thermal, whatever the fuck that is. Right there. It's, like, travelling. Holy cow. Now let's get into our second investigation. One piece in particular, I think you'll, uh, greatly appreciate. I was up at this rock, like, kind of pile right there. And I look and into this, like, washed-out, dried riverbed, I see someone just walking. Yeah. No headlight, nothing. And just booking it, and I'm like "Who is that?" Must be one of us, 'cause they're walking towards the cars. No, he just fucking turned. Now they're running. Whoever the fuck that... Who is that? I could make out enough detail in the thermal, the guy was kind of like a head walker, like his head was kind of hunched, hunched forward. And he was really swinging his arms and he was booking it. Yeah. He gets to about probably 30 yards from those poles, and he looks up and we had all our cars lined up here. And he looks and I see him stop and he pivots and runs full speed over the hill. He kept running. And they're, like, somewhere in this region here. That was fucking weird. Who the fuck was that?! I'll just show you on here. OK. Watch where my laser pointer is. Oh, totally. Yeah, he's booking. We lost him over the ridge at this point. It was covering ground pretty fast. Yes. It covered what... We just did an experiment. One of our guys just tried to cover the same distance at, like, a full power stride. Wow. Yeah. And it took him 15 seconds. In the video, he covers the same distance in 10. Yeah. And the gentleman that did the test for us, like, runs every day, so he's not even like someone that's out of shape. He was going full blast and he did it in, like 15 to 20 seconds. This is not the easiest terrain. No. And the moon, there was no moon last night because the clouds were so dense. That's right. And it was pitch black out here. 1:45 in the morning. It was raining out. Yep. There was no reason for anyone to be out. Oh, it was raining too? It was raining. And that, we found his tracks. They start actually all the way over by one of the oil pumps. Yeah. I got... here, I got photos, actually, I can show you. Of some in the mud. Um... They look like a little shoe. Yeah, they do look like small feet. Oh, yeah. Which is weird. Oh, wow. We took it all the way, the tracks, near the oil. And then they just stopped. And there was no car they came up. Unless a helicopter dropped him off, we don't know how he started there. Here, you want to look, check again? Yeah, I totally do. Last night I was buzzing 'cause I'm like "Hang on a second here." Yeah, you guys have some pretty good stuff. You think so? Yeah. I can't stop watching this. Dude, keep watching it. Since you see this, have you seen anything like this in your findings or heard of something like this? Well, it goes right along the normal way they act and react to people. It, it seems to be watching you at first. Mm-hm. And then you became aware of it and it tried to evade. They're usually in the shadows watching people. Yeah. I think this is just phenomenal. Yeah. I had an expectation to see some lights moving around the sky, maybe. Yeah. I was not expecting to capture something like this. That's, that's just not your average nightwalker. No. Well, I hope this did some justice, 'cause, uh, I don't know what we could do better than that. No, I think you guys engaged with something that most people don't want to engage with. Mm-hm. It doesn't look as human as I thought it would. Yeah. Well, Ryan, thank you so much. Thank you. I really appreciate it. Thank you, brother. Thank you, guys. Alright. Well, let's, uh, load up the gear and get out. Let's go, let's go. And let's make sure we have night vision. Yes. Thermal. I think this could be a free-for-all out here. Skinwalkers, aliens. I mean, dude, it's a party. Maybe this is the place where, like, there's a little leak in the system and things kind of can pass through and you're like "Oh, shit." This is, like, Bourbon Street for paranormal. You know what I'm saying. You know, the funny thing about being in the Uinta Basin, people are kind of drawn here for specific things, UFOs, portals, cryptids, skinwalkers. But when you come here looking for it, I often find you find something you're not looking for. We came here looking for UFOs, and I think we found something that would go into the "other than" category. Yes. So we've seen a light, we've seen a moving shadow. Yep. We've seen, uh, something blinking in the sky and we've seen a partridge in a pear tree. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. I've never been to a place like this, ever. Yeah. It's its own realm over here. It really is, it does feel like a different place, like its own entity. Captioned by Ai-Media ai-media. tv
