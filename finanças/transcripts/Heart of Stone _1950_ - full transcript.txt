The Cold Heart A colour film inspired by Wilhelm Kauff Script Paul Verhoeven - Wolff v. Gordon The world's swell, so brother, let's take a hike, into the big world, where we like it well! Ree Rah How, summer is here now, winter's lost the battle, summer shows its mettle. Ree Rah How! summer's here now. We're not proud, we don't need wild horses who could drag us away when flowers hold sway. Ree Rah How, summer's here now, winter's lost the battle, summer shows it mettle. Ree Rah How! Summer is here now. Your turn! Hompf! Ezechiel! Right on target again, Ezechiel! Straight to the bird's heart! What if it had been a person? Straight to the heart, too! Cutthroat! Come and choose! Here, the glass imp for Sunday's children! And this is Dutch Michael, for fearless men! Be afraid of Dutch Michael! If you want to know his deeds you have to read the horrific tales, written down in this book. For only 10 kreutzer anybody can call it theirs. Be afraid of Dutch Michael! It was lovely. Look... not enough to cover your taxes, but send your child on the ride! I'll remember that! - Out the way, Ezechiel! - Sit on a chair! Where Ezechiel sits there's enough space for me. Put your leg under the table! If the Black Forest's two richest men argue for a seat at this table ... may I be so bold and join them? Stop your jabbering Amtmann, sit down! Wine! For Amtmann, too! I say, you make finer glasses, Master Anton! A sturdy glass! Well made! I arrive just in time, Uncle! For cake and wine! Hot... Any property seizures coming up? Anything for us? Timber, wheat, glass... Old Winktritz' heirs are selling the glass works in Lower Forest. The glass works? We won't be bidding there! A glass works needs a hard-working man! And you're the master, everybody knows what you can produce from glass. Nowadays glass doesn't sell too easily. The dance is starting! Good musicians, do play! Do play a jig, play away! Cleaned up, tidied up, lead to the dance! Yippee! Yippee! Hooray! Hey, aren't you going? Elsbeth loves to dance! - What a nice couple! - If only it was time! Who'll be King of the Dance floor, who'll be Queen? - Elsbeth! Elsbeth! - And? - Hannes! He's aping you, Ezechiel. The most respected man near and far! And the best shot! Long live he! Don't you want to dance anymore? Are you dancing? Hey, where to? - What's that? - It's only Coal-Marmut Peter! He's wearing his best robe! It's the coal maker's festive garb! Let him be, please! Must be shopping for a bride. What're you after with your sooty hands? I've been delivering coal. You are and remain the dirty Coal-Marmut Peter! Coal-Marmut Peter! Coal-Marmut Peter! Play something! Come on, Peter. Dance with me. Wasn't going to come today. I was going to... The Queen of the dance floor... may only dance with the King! Queen? Ridiculous... They're all have-nots! So you did go to the fair today too. It's still on tomorrow! And the day after. And in dad's Sunday suit! I just wanted to see Elsbeth dance. Well well... Elsbeth... - Eat! - It can't go on that way. If my lot doesn't improve soon I'll harm myself. Why can't I dance as well as Hannes? Why aren't I as wealthy as boastful Ezechiel? The salesmen, the woodsmen and the glass makers... Why do I have to be coal maker? When Father was alive we often had poor people visiting. How we spoke about rich folk and how they went about getting rich. Not everybody's better off than the rich folks. Some of it isn't natural. I'm sick of being poor. Oh, I know... Elsbeth! Ha... Elsbeth! Elsbeth and me! And you've never spoken to her! What for? Her uncle wouldn't have it! Try it! After all you're Sunday's child! Is it true, Mother, that the glass imp only appears to Sunday's children? Don't worry about the glass imp, Peter! Stick with your trade. It'll feed you. Like your father before you. The kind of life you've led, Father and you? The miserable hut? I'll go to the glass imp and make a wish. Wishes... Work, like Father. I won't continue like that. If I can't go to the glass imp I'll go to... Dutch Michael. Peter, he's evil and brings bad luck! Where else can I go? You always want to leave. Stay here! The other coal maker work in the woods and make coal. They survive! With dirty hands... torn rags... and never money! No, no, Mother... I'm Sunday's child! Mother, what about the glass imp? By the great pine, at full moon, at Tannenbühl you say: 'Guardian in the forest green, older than any I've ever seen,' And... what then, Mother? 'You own the land of pines, and...' What else, Mother? The last line! - I don't know... - But, you used to recite it. - I forgot! - Pity! Never mind! If I really am a Sunday's child I won't need the last line! Wishing you a wonderful evening, Mr Glass Imp! Mr Glass Imp! Guardian! Guardian in the forest green, older than any I've ever seen, You own the land of pine, and... and...You own the land of pine, and... and... how does it go on? You own the land of pine, and... I don't know the last line, Mr Guardian! But I'm Sunday's child! You think I didn't see you, Mr Guardian? Wait, little Fellow. I'll soon catch you! Stand still! Stand still! You want to see me? Look! See me! Stand still! - Stand! - Stand? Look! Alone, where the pines stand... only visible to Sunday's children! Peter Munk! What brings you to Tannenbühl, eh? Speak! I... want to go home! Don't lie! You think I didn't see you beg the Dwarf? Just as well you didn't know the formula! He's a miser, that poison dwarf. How much do you need? Are you, by any chance... Dutch Michael? Help! Stop, Peter! The ditch is my boundary! Look, there's gold in Holland! It can be yours if you want it. The price is low. In Holland there's gold!... Gold! Guardian in the green spruce forest you are truly ancient, All's yours where pine does grow... Only visible to Sunday's children. So you've met the rascal? Dutch Michael, eh? I snatched his wonder wand. Won't part with it before long. So you're the wood grouse who grabbed the snake? I thank you for it! Well, then. What do you want, eh? - Isn't it obvious? - I see, Peter. You humans are a strange breed! Hardly anybody's content with his station in life! If you were a glass maker you'd want to be lumberjack, and if you're a lumberjack, dear Peter... ... you're bothered by Amtmann's might! - Well, but I'm Sunday's child! - That I know. To every Sunday's child that finds me, I tend to grant two wishes at first. Only two wishes? At first...only two. And a third if it's not foolish! So I get... three wishes? Three wishes, but only two for now. Don't you understand? Yes. Good. My first wish is to dance better than Hannes Schlurker, the dance floor king and to have as much money in my pocket at the tavern... as the wealthy Ezechiel, and secondly... What a silly wish! To dance? Money to gamble? - Well... I know... Elsbeth - Yes! Okay, granted! And your second wish? Make it a more sensible choice! Well, I wish to have Winkfritz' beautiful glass factory It'll be auctioned off tomorrow anyway. Peter... nothing else? Well, you could throw in horse and a carriage. Horse? Carriage? You should have wished for a better mind, Peter! What do you know about the craft of a glass maker? Nothing... but I can learn! Yes, but when? At the tavern, at Ezechiel's? Or on the dance floor? As you like. I'll grant you this wish, too. Thank you! Take this... and this... and this. And tomorrow bid at the auction. However did you think of that? I was embarrassed in front of Ezechiel! I had never seen you with that... coal maker fellow. Or did you have a fight with Hannes? Wanted to get your own back, maybe? I can't imagine that either. Hannes is such a well-respected fellow. You can't just let him go. I'm not going with him! Just you find a finer farm than Hannes'! I don't want him! Elsbeth...how can you be so silly! Poor lass... no parents... can't expect much in the way of a trousseau from me! - You're merely my uncle! - And your guardian! I won't allow that people gossip about you! Today you'll only dance with Hannes... and if he asks you... you know... you'll say: Yes, it's all been arranged. Look, the glass factory's new owner. Oh! Who? Him? Come on, Elsbeth! Who lent you the team? You show up like old Winktritz in person! Me? You've seen nothing yet! Come on, Mother. Look after the horse and feed him. I don't want to wear the cloth in the bar. - Buy me a hat! - A hat? - What with? - But Peter... Only this morning you had all those gold ducats. Well, I spent them on the glass works. Look here... here... And you want to go to the tavern with empty pockets? Oh... the tavern! I'll have money, there! Let's go! Good morning! Here, take a seat. There's no room for you here. Off you go, to the stables! There's plenty of room here! What's got into the impertinent coal maker? Join the others on the dance bench. There you are at last! Dear Sir, please buy this necklace. I'm supposed to do what? I need twenty thaler. Otherwise I'll have to sell my cow. I only buy timber. I'm going to Amsterdam tomorrow. I don't need farmers' beads. Get lost! Don't you have twenty thaler in your pockets? Hmm... What you take me for? A pauper like you, he? There you go! A hundred thaler, ha, ha, ha! Thanks, that'll do! So, Mother... Buy yourself that hat. And he's bought the glass factory this morning. Where did you get the money so suddenly You think you're the only one with money? Come on, you won't regret it! Did your uncle speak with you yet? What about? Well, about me! About my farm! About everything! I don't know what you mean, Hannes. Don't play dumb, Lischen. Well, that. Yes. Uncle spoke about that. Well, and? Interested? I say we wait until after these three holidays. This requires consideration. You've got somebody else in mind? I know who. Give me the jewels. Du you have twenty thaler? I'll give you a hundred. What do you like about him? He can't even dance. That Coal-Munk-Peter! The dance starts. I'm the Queen. I have to go. Come on! Hannes, where is Elsbeth? No idea where's she's at! - She'll be back. - What's that supposed to mean? Where is she? Will you run off again when I want to dance with you? No. It's different today. This is the first time that you speak to me. - We used to talk a lot as children. - I mean later... - Never. - You were always with the other fellows. You expect me to wait at home for you? We always used to look at each other. What's the good of many words? I say, Mrs Munk? Look at you, with your umbrella! Gift from my son, owner of the glass works. A pity it doesn't rain! Yes, a real pity! Courtesy of King and Queen dance as well as you have seen! Dressed to the nines. Ready to dance in lines! Hurry! Come on, let's go! Where have you been all this time? Here comes the jump. Eight. Did he knock you off your feet, that Peter Munk? It shan't last. Wedding in spring! Everybody's invited! These are the IOUs. I've bought them all. Peter Munk, Peter Munk, Peter Munk. Noose is tightening around his neck! Peter knows nothing about making glass. But Master Anton, he does know! But he knows nothing of selling. No matter how many clocks I make if I don't sell them we have nothing to eat! Calm down. What'll the girls think if you're always moaning about Peter? He'll learn soon enough! He's only learned to throw dice, drink and dance! He only dances with me. Who can he throw dice and drink with? Ezechiel's away in Holland! Wherever you go, your Peter is indebted. We'll manage somehow to pay every Heller we owe you. He's only cross because you didn't take Hannes. Tomorrow is my wedding's day. It'll put an end to all that gossip. I wouldn't mind a husband, either. This is the last time you add to your tab. Let me tell you, your wedding tomorrow you won't be celebrating here unless I get my money before. Just wait for Ezechiel! Do you think that Ezechiel will lend you money? Not exactly, but... You used to be a hard-working fellow Well, well, I don't mind as long as you settle up. Seven, nine, eleven. Master, Mr Amtmann is up there. He's taking glass inventory. 428 bowls, 735 bottles, 286 jugs. A pile in the shed, all the bottles and jugs. There're some glasses! Bohemian crystal, two, 4, 6, 8... Is it recorded? Yes! 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26... Pay attention, you oaf! It would have gone to the stock room with the rest. - Can you pay your debts? - Give me a few more days! Tomorrow I'll auction off the factory and put you in the tower. Why the hurry? Here's the oven, and the wood. The stock room's bursting with glass. - And where's the money? - Don't you see? People are working! One day all glass will be sold! Maybe. Maybe not. One last extension: tomorrow morning! Drive the cases home! I'm thirsty. Time to call it a day, master. Good luck tomorrow! I'm sorry I can't help. Well, then... All the best! Peter, what's with the long face? My groom mustn't look like that the day before the wedding. What ails you, Peter? Never mind! If the two of us stick together all will be well. Come on there's work to do for tomorrow. They've loaded the wedding wares on the carriage and they're putting up the maypoles in front the house. I worry that my trousseau won't be ready, but Anna and Ilse and Bärbel... Are you ready at all? Yes... Mother's prepared everything. The wedding planner wrote down exact instruction When the early bells chime the fellows will fetch you on horseback. Outside the house Uncle and the wedding planner will wait and lead you in. I'll be waiting in the big room with the girl and kin. You come in, approach me and take me to church. Will you do it? You'll have to be very nice, otherwise I won't go. Of course, Elsbeth. Then I'll sit on the carriage with the trousseau, Uncle next to me, and we'll ride through the village to church. You and the fellows ride behind us. Apart. After the ceremony you'll sit next to me just like now. But... we'll be husband... and wife. Yes! Elsbeth. - Oh, you're nearly ready! - Yes, but nearly! - Have you seen Ezechiel? - No. You'll be surprised how Dutch he looks! What? Ezechiel is here? - Yes. - No! - I'll be back! - Peter! Come in, then. Ezechiel's arrived. At last, Ezechiel. This time you were gone for ages! Business was good in Holland. Well, then...! - I'm a good merchant! - How do you know? It's a well-known fact. So... - Squat down and throw the dice! - Have any money left to gamble? Today we're not playing for pennies. Today we're playing for thaler! - A penny for the Amtmann. - Just let him come! As you ask, Mr Munk. Did you sell your glass at last? Wait a little. I'll tell you soon. Seven! Eight! My throw was better! I'll finish you off now, Ezechiel! I'm out of money. I quit. Well, Peter... I'll finish you off! Where's he getting all that money? He was broke this afternoon. The seizure is prepared. Tomorrow he's going to the tower, as you asked. - But if today he... - Don't worry. Ezechiel lets him win. - Come and drink wine! - You know how thirsty we are! There, sit down. - At least four. - Eight! - Sixteen! - Thirty! Seven! Eighteen! New cup and dice! What's wrong with the dice? Nothing, nothing... One more. The last one! Everything! Thirteen! Go... Eighteen! Now he's got more money than he can carry! Let's keep playing! An honest player assists the others! Lend me some! Even a hundred thaler! I just want ten! To your health, Mr Munk! In the tavern you'll have, just as you wished, as much money in your pocket as the wealthy Ezechiel! A game's a game. You lost, I won. Good night! Peter Munk, your winnings don't belong to you. Pay off your debts! - Yes... my pocket's empty! - Where did you leave all your money? Look... I don't believe it. Cheat! Let's go, have a look! Where's the money? Cheat! That's using tricks! ... to the gallows! To the gallows! To the gallows! ... to the gallows! Cheat! Such a cheat! It's real. You lowly, lazy fellow! Just deserts for your pathetic wishes! - Brains, Peter. You're lacking brains! - I'm as clever as anybody! Don't I get a third wish? Give me 200.000 pieces of gold right now! Don't you dare to laugh, or else... Evil fellow! There they are! Peter isn't with them. There... we've got him. He isn't there! Sit down. He didn't come home all night. Has something happened to him? - I'm off. - Me, too. Come on! The shame! The shame! He'll come for sure! Dutch Michael! Dutch Michael! Dutch Michael! Come! You're afraid, eh? You're terribly tall, Wait, little Peter. I have just the right cure. You're still afraid, eh? What? I much prefer you like this. You see, Peter! You can trust me. Come on! Where to? To mine? Is everything there so ...terribly big, too? My house rises and shrinks like us. It grows with me! Everything inside will be familiar to you. Oh, yes... It's gloomy, a Black Forest home like this, isn't it? ... Narrow! You should go out into the world! The great rivers, trees, - ... the sea. - I've never left the forest. That's no life for a real man! You can't become anybody here. Oh, well... Are you indebted? Hey! The dwarf is a miserable miser. I felt sorry for you back then, in the woods. I thought, what a useful fellow... ... he could become somebody in this world! He only lacks the courage to try his luck. A pity! If it was necessary... ... I'd have the courage! You? You tremble when I only look at you. Wasn't your heart in your throat when you summoned me? Yes... a little... And the mouth dries out. And daggers in the head! And the stomach aches... - Correct? - Yes, that's correct. There's the problem! Give me the beating thing and see how well you'll have it! What good are courage and force... a few beats of the silly heart can make you tremble. And the torture of love, of honour, of faithfulness. Why should a sensible fellow bother with those things? And what made you dig into your pocket? Every time his man offered up his hat? Your heart! Not your eyes or your tongue, not your arms or your legs. But your heart! Because you always take everything to heart! Yes, but if I give you... my heart, then... ... then I have to die! It's different with me... Come with me! Look. They threw away all fear and sorrow. None of these hearts beats with worry, and their former owners are happy to have expelled the anxious guests from their homes. Here you'll find the most respected hearts from the entire Black Forest. Everybody who gave me their heart is rich ... and powerful in the world. Yes... but... ... what's in their breasts in its place? This... ... a heart... of stone. But it must feel cold... in the breast. Definitely. But pleasant! Why should a heart be warm? In winter the warmth's no good. You need ... brandy more than a warm heart. And in summer... ... when it's hot and sticky... ... you won't believe how nice and refreshing such a cold heart feels! Is that all? I wasn't hoping for money... and you'd be content with stone! Once you carry such a heart in your breast the millions will follow soon. Millions... That wouldn't be half bad! Great! Do it! Well, Peter... Now, put your trust in the water. It's cool and cold like your heart. Use it and become rich! Go to the raftsmen. I'll give you big trunks. Let yourself be carried down rivers, float down the Rhine. And float the timber to the shore near Cologne. What originates in the Black Forest? Mighty trunks, this time... Fitter timber for boats I've never seen! What's your offer? - Five hundred! - Six hundred! - Seven hundred! - Hell, eight hundred! That much? Are you crazed? Bid nine hundred and yours it is! Nine hundred. You're in my way. Move! - Cheers! - Yes! Sign, then! Another beer? Coming up! Coming! For you, yes. Well, cheers! Cheers! Yes, yes, at once. Yes, it's all good! Buy me a drink! Buy your own beer if you're thirsty! You, behave! We've seen bigger dwarfs here in Cologne! You think you got a good price for your timber, eh? I'm satisfied. You are strange fellows, you are! First you fell the tree, then you lug it to the river and raft it here. And what do you get in return? Not the fourth part of what Cologne timber merchants get for it in Holland! How come? Doesn't the timber stay in Cologne? What would we do with all that timber? No. He's going to Amsterdam tomorrow morning. Interesting, isn't it? Sit down, will you? I'll get you a beer. Are the gentlemen staying the night? No, no... no, no. We're sleeping on the raft tonight. All right. - What are you doing there? - Carry on! What are you doing? Where're you taking the timber? It's been sold. It's ours no longer. Shut up! Hannes, it's you! How fitting! Come in! - Is Elsbeth here? - Yes, of course. Step inside. Elsbeth! Hannes is taking you dancing! Why don't you go for a change? I have a lot of washing to do. Good evening, Hannes! Good evening, Elsbeth! It's been a very long time! I rarely get out these days. Leave the washing and go with Hannes! You used to enjoy dancing. And you were always opposed! Well, but to go dancing after a whole year, that's different, isn't it? Come on, join me. There're new musicians from Schorndorf! Really? I don't even know that I remember how to dance. That you'll never forget! You two used to be Dance floor King and Queen, didn't you? Uncle! Maybe I should really go. But... first I need to change. Yes, yes. Hurry, then! - You bought white horses and carriage? - Yes, over in Cannstadt! The only ones in the entire land! I believe it! From Schorndorf? No, from Cannstadt! But I meant... the musicians! The musicians are from Schorndorf! But the white horses from Cannstatt! - So? What's the matter, Elsbeth? Hurry! Carry on! I'm not going. Peter Munk! I'm your friend! - Give me the grain! - You know the price! You're ruining me! - I can't pay that price! - Then don't! The grain silos of all Amsterdam are empty! Mine are full. The Mayor promised me all the taxes of the province ... if I bring grain! I only want money. The Legion's recruitment officer lost one of the force-enlisted men! The lad's quite right. Who wants to be cannon fodder for money? Peter Munk! Let's change the subject. Good. I'll buy the grain at your price. These gents invited us in. A feast in our honour... On the table! Aren't you ashamed? Aren't you ashamed? Unbearble fellow! Captain? - I gather you lost one? - Bunch of cretins! Until one delivers them to the colonies... The transport was ready. I wanted to set out... ... a hundred men, each cost twelve guilders in cash! What do you pay me if I find replacements? Twelve guilders! Make it fifteen... ... and he's yours! You'll find a compatriot here! I know. Him. What do you want? What's the matter? Nooo! Nooo! Nooo! Ezechiel! What happened to you, compatriot! A pleasure to see you here in Amsterdam. Be my guest. Up! Sorry. What does this... ... this... feathered beast... So you're quite at home here. I can understand it. What of the Black Forest ? It's growing. - And... the nectar? - It's flowing! What else is new? Winter's coming, like always. What, no news at all? Now that you ask... Hannes is getting married! And I know who to! Handsome fellow, that Hannes! And since you've been gone, again the best dancer in the Black Forest! The bill, inn keeper! My horses! I'm leaving. Where to? To make sure the Black Forest spruce won't grow into the sky! Thank you for the company. The wedding celebrations have ended. Why are you locking up? I've always opposed this wedding. Such meanness! Such an affront! Peter! Peter! That's not all! I have more money and properties in Holland! You're a rich woman! Please! Go! I forbade it before! Don't give that lot anything! You mustn't, you hear? No more giving my wealth to a bunch of beggars, that... If I catch you again, you'll feel my hand! Where are you going? Elsbeth! Nice of you to visit me! It's too cold to get up, for me! You should light a fire. You still have firewood. The last of it. Who knows when you can bring me more? Maybe today. And if Peter notices? There'll be trouble! He's such a rich man. Why does he mind me having a warm stove? And some food? Mother! I'll find a position in the town! - Elsbeth! Don't you care for him any longer? - I do! I do, but... I can't stay with him! He's not longer the same Peter... ...I've been waiting for all this time. Being away hardened his heart. He used to be different... when he still slept on that bed! They all want to borrow money! But nobody wants to pay it back! Off the property! Off! Step lively! Quick! Before my feet freeze off! Get down, now! Off! - Cutthroat! - Leave it. Won't get you anywhere. Good boy! - What's that? - It's mine! - No, it's mine! Off you go! You, Klaus! Have pity, lady, with an old man! My feet... can't go on in this cold. Let me sit next to your fire for a while. All right. Come in. Are you leaving? Don't do it, is my advice! I mean... it's bitterly cold. You're better off by the hot stove than outside in the cold. Such is a herald's lot! He mustn't mind the weather! We all have our own lot! Come on, put down your basket. And have a drink! It'll do you good. There you go! In my whole life I've rarely seen such generosity in people! Woman, you have a good heart. And such a heart will find its just reward! The reward you shall have at once! Even my best wine! My best glass... for those unwashed gobs! And what's that supposed to be? You want to... Take your just deserts! Forgive me, Peter! I can't be like you want me to be. I... forgive you. What's the matter with her? You've... slain her! Aaah... It's you, Guardian! Do you want to bring me to the gallows? I'm a stupid, pathetic ghost! That's what I get for keeping an eye on you. Your woman who never stopped loving you! Who wanted to stay close to you so you'd have a feeling heart nearby! ... and you... ... you club her to death! Did I sell my heart? You only have yourself to blame. Her blood is on you! It's you who killed her! You won't escape... ... just punishment... from the executioner! Ezechiel? What do you think of death? You end up in a grave. What about... the executed? They rot in the noose! What about... ... their hearts? ... food for the ravens! And if somebody no longer has a heart? You mean I'm heartless? You do! But it's hard as a rock. What do you think? What becomes of our hearts? I once asked a scholar. He said in death our hearts are weighed. The light ones rise, the heavy ones sink. I suppose our stones will be heavy alright. But... that's a long way off! No. Not for me. Not for me! I want to live! You hear, I want to live! What? What got into him? Guardian... Guardian! Guardian! Listen, Guardian! Save me from the gallows. I want to live! What kind of miserable life don't you want to give up, Peter, eh? Don't I get a third wish? Now you'll have to grant it! Can hearts of stone make wishes? Well, remove the dead stone. Did I strike the bargain with you? Go to Dutch Michael! He'd never grant it! I do pity you... wretched as you are... ... I'll help you for Elsbeth's sake. If you're begging for your life as well as a warm heart... ... let me offer counsel. You can't get your heart back by force... ... but only by... ... cunning! Because Dutch Michael ... is merely foolish Michael, clever appearances notwithstanding. You've slain your wife. Great! I would have done likewise! You'll have to go abroad for a time so they can't nab you. There'll be much noise when she's found. Michael! You lied to me. I still have my heart! How else could I still feel sorry? The fault's yours! What, you still have your heart? Yes. You merely stopped it beating! It's still in my breast. And Ezechiel's, too! And he told me you're a great liar! You're not the right man for this! What? What are you saying, you? Follow me! There, read out the names. Hannes! Amtmann! Ezechiel... and here Peter. See how it beats? Could easily be made from wax! Mine's still in my breast! I'll prove the difference, you fool! Come on... Feel how your heart beats now, eh? Now, then... give it back now. I don't want to! Then you have to die! I'd rather die than give up my heart again! Peter... Now you'll feel like a human again. With the heart of stone I regretted nothing. My eyes stayed dry, but now... I was wretched. I have brought ruin on my creditors, I set the dogs on the poor, I didn't respect my mother... and my dear Elsbeth... I don't want to live, Mr Guardian! Beat me to death so that my miserable life can end at last! It's not as simple as that, dear fellow! You think you die, and that's that. Who dries the tears? Who mends the sorrow that you caused? How could I ever start over again? You can try. What do I have to do... ... for them to love me again? Live with those who belong to you. You can do it! Get up! Look! Trunks grow here... and there's your axe! Well, but... Start now! Strike it. And let it all be erased! Peter! Peter! Elsbeth! Come... End
