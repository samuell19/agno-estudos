Heck, i remember a time when you couldn't wait to run it. - Okay, stop that. - You gotta go back there Because i am leaving it to you. - Grandma, thank you, really, But cupid's is the reason i left. - No, it wasn't. No. A rash young man left with a broken heart. A grown man, soldier, has come back. Now, you go there And you run it while i'm in here, At least for now. - Okay. But only until you get better. - Okay. - Okay. There's my cousin. - Hey, tom. Heard you were back in town. - Come here. - It's good to see you, kip. - Great to see you. - I don't know if you're a part of this. Grandma's trying to give me the bed and breakfast. - Yeah, you know, she said she was gonna do that. I was wondering how you feel about that. I'll run it until she's ready to take it over again. - I'm here to help you any way i can. And a word of warning to start out. - What? - Chelsea's mayor. - No. - Yes, youngest in the town history. She'll tell you about it, believe me, many times. - She actually did it. I'm kind of impressed. - No, don't be. She was the only living person on the ballot. And she's still single. I don't know if you're interested. - I'm not. - No, didn't think so. So as the boss of cupid's, I'm getting married in three weeks. - That's right. Congratulations. - You gonna have the place ready? - Yeah, absolutely. - And susie's shower is this weekend. - My first wedding shower. That's great. Thank you. - Welcome back. - There has got to be a catch. This sounds a little too good to be true. Are you sure about this, jerry? - Got the plans right here to prove it. I'm gonna put your two-Bit town on the map. - Should i ask you how you got these plans? - You can, but i won't tell you. Boom. - Wow. A four-Lane highway? - Yup. - Four lanes. What--What is this dark area? - Soon to be worth a fortune. Some dive hotel where my mall's gonna be. We should be able to pick it up cheap. Cupid's bed and breakfast? That's a joke, right? - Still there. - Ah, wonderful. Tommy? Hon, he's not a tommy anymore. He's a soldier. And now he's back to help us run the place. - Welcome back. - I am just so glad to see you two. - Come here. All: ah. - Sandra, steve, i can't believe it. This place hasn't changed a bit. We're all older. - What was that noise? - Uh, it's probably more than one shower going. Pipe's been creaky for a while. System's showing a little age. - Are you having a nice time? - Yeah. - Tom, i'm happy you're back. I'm not much of an administrator. - Don't look at me. I've been serving my country, not being an innkeeper. - I think i like the honeymooning couples the best. - I don't know if i can handle that much bliss. - Well, you don't have to. You can help with the accounts and the paperwork, You know, the money, some of the maintenance. Sandra and i can take care of the customers. - Mm-Hmm. - Oh, a letter came from the tax assessor The day after your grandmother went into the hospital. We didn't want to bother her with it. - Well, this just says they want to see her as soon as possible. All right, let's not say anything to grandma, okay? Until i find out what this is about. - Works for me. - Okay. - So you want to make me acting chief? - Yep, just while i'm on my honeymoon. - You do know i've only been here a month, right? - Yes, but you gave my cousin a ticket Even though you knew he was my cousin. - Here you go. - Thank you, sweetheart. - Sure. - Thank you. Okay, i still don't see how-- - There's nothing to see. You're a good, solid, experienced cop. That's why i hired you. It's nothing against the local guys. So do you want it or not? - Yes. - Good. Done. Chief fairfax. - Chief. - Here's to suzie, the future mrs. Chief of police. - Okay, say "true love." All: true love. - Perfect. - Thank you all for coming to my shower. - Okay, ladies, let's go play some games, And open gifts, and eat way too much cake. Come on. Okay, let's go. - Let's go. - Gonna break my diet today. Grandma's actually doing really well. She's just-- - Yeah. - She looks tired, not her normal, bubbly self. I just-- - Yeah. I'm gonna see her later today after the shower. - What? No. Go now, she'll love it. - Well, you don't have to tell me twice. Thanks, tom. - Thomas. Nice to see you again. - Chelsea. Mayor, huh? Huh. - Yeah, youngest in the history of the town, actually. But we're not here to talk about me today. - I'm actually here to celebrate suzie. - You're late. - Better late than never. Miss mayor. - Chief. - Thanks for coming. - Well, you and your fiancee are a major part of this community. How could i not? Hm. Well, i guess i'm gonna go mingle. Oh, and chief, as mayor, i'd love to talk to you About your property, and any future plans You and your family might have with it. - Oh, well, don't ask me. It's grandma's place. But actually, tom's running it right now. - Oh. Well then, thomas, You and i should have coffee soon. I'll call you. - Gonna have coffee with her? - Do pigs have wings? - Bye. It's nice, isn't it? - It's beautiful. - Super cop. You look great. - Oh. - Opposed to how i look in uniform? - No. No, i just-- - I accept the compliment. - What are you doing out here? - I came to support kip. I mean, suzie's great. But i don't know any of those ladies. And weddings aren't really my thing. - Oh, you're gonna love this place. It's nothing but weddings, and true love, and-- - All the true love nonsense. - Not a believer? - Not even close. - It's nice to meet a fellow traveler. - You too, huh? - Mm-Hmm. Yeah, i needed this. Fresh air. Good company. - Yeah, me too. That's why i moved here. - Where you from? - Chi-Town. - Chicago cop. - Yeah. Better watch out. - Did you get tired of the big city? - More like chicago's male population. - Oh, yeah? Plan on sticking around these parts? - Yeah. It's quiet. It's beautiful. It's over 1,000 miles from chicago. - Yeah. Put yourself back there for a minute. - Not in a million years. - No, no, no, no, no. You asked me why i wanted to leave. This--This is my chicago. - Nice knowing you. So how long are you staying? - Well, until my grandma's up and around. So the time thing is a little fluid. - Hm. - Plus, i got kip and suzie's wedding coming up. So maybe i'll see you there. - Maybe before. We have a court date, remember? - Oh, yeah. I guess the bonding on the beach didn't help me? - Actually, i wouldn't call it bonding. So until you've handled your legal obligations, Don't leave town. I carry guns, remember? - All right, so i want you guys to see all this. You see all that land over there? That is gonna be ours. I have the prints right here. So what we're gonna do: We're gonna knock down that back fence. You see the back fence along those trees right there? Yeah, we're gonna take that fence, Knock it down, expand. Maybe-- Edge of the property limit, It goes all the way along that back fence, So we really could potentially have growth potential there. Hi. - Hey. Can i help you? - Uh, nope, we're good. Just go about your business. - You're standing on it. That is my family's business. - Oh. Really? - Yeah. What are you doing out here? - Nothing. We were just admiring this beautiful scenery. Right, guys? - Yep. - Uh-Huh. - You know, this really is wonderful property. You ever think about selling it? - No, it's not for sale right now. But thanks for asking. - Of course. Uh, bye. All right, so here's what we're gonna need to do. - Thanks for seeing me. - I'm sorry about your grandma. I hope she gets well soon. - Thank you. - But since this is public record, I can talk to you about this before more time passes And we can get it straightened out. - Okay, what's going on? - What's going on is a little delicate And more complicated than a letter could describe. So let me come to the point. - Please. - Cupid's bed and breakfast owes 21 years Of back property taxes. - What? - I'll explain. It may take a minute. - Do you remember a guy named lance kinney? - Yeah, i remember lance. Nice guy. Ex-County clerk. - Yeah. - Did you know that he found his true love at cupid's? - Not surprised, this part of the country. - Cupid was so good to him, in fact, That he decided grandma didn't have to pay Her property taxes for 21 years. - You're kidding. - Seems lance just upped and deep-Sixed Grandma's tax bill all because he had a happy marriage. - How could she miss that? - I don't know. - Can you cut a deal? - Homer, the new tax assessor, Waived the late fees. - Well, that's nice. So how much does she owe? - $92,000. Every room is booked. And the shower was great. Suzie's perfect for kip. - Oh, she is a beautiful girl, inside and out. You need one like that. - Can we change the subject? There is actually something i need to talk to you about. - Okay. Like have you met any nice girls lately? - Nice try. Right now, you're the only girl that matters to me. - You are so full of baloney. Do i have to ask? Have you run into chelsea yet? - We've been reintroduced. - Oh, i assume it didn't go well. - Chelsea's chelsea. I'm fine. - Oh, i'm so glad, tommy. I'm proud of you, dear. So what did you want to talk about? - It's not important. Have i told you how much i love you? - Mm. Mm. Thank you, tommy. - I really am busy. What do you want? - Remember how you told me to be creative And take initiative? - No. Well--Well, you did. - Okay. - I am working on buying a property That will pay us at least a hundredfold return On our investment. - What are you doing? - Just leave it to me. I'll make you proud, i promise. - Is it legal? - Cross my heart. - Is it within the budget i gave you for your department? - If i play my cards right, yeah. - You think this is a good deal, you run it by bill. If he says yes, go for it. Oh, oh, jerry, jerry. Your mother called. She wants to know if you can come over this weekend, Your sister's birthday. - Tell her i'll be there. - It'll make her very happy. I love it when she's happy. - Me too. Hey, it's me. - It's not some low-Rent motel you can just force them out. The owner is an old lady who's sick in the hospital. And even you're smart enough not to go there. - Watch me. - No, this needs to be handled delicately. You know, thomas is running the place now. So just let me go in and soften him up a little bit. I have some experience with that. - We need to move on this within the month. Otherwise, the news about the highway Is gonna get out and we're sunk. - Well, then get out of my way and let me work. I'll get us what we need. And then you can build me my mall. - You were going 25 in a 45. That's considered reckless driving. You could cause an accident. - If it helps, i had no idea i was driving that slow. - Are you okay? - No. Mm-Mm. - Yeah. That's a lot of money. - I don't know what i'm gonna do. - Well, you could hire a lawyer. - And fight the county? - Yeah. - That could take months. That--That could take years. - Mm. Aw, that's right. You're leaving. - You want to have lunch with me tomorrow? Two anti-Romantics banding together For a non-Date. - Yeah, okay. - Okay? - Hm. Trust me, you were right not to tell her. Thank you. So maybe we could declare bankruptcy. - Not on property taxes. I already checked. - Well, how soon do they have to be paid? - It was all a blur after i got the bill. But i think he said something about six months. We'll figure something out. - Hello? - This is real deal, over. Come in, circus pony. - I thought your call sign was "clown boy." That's not very nice. How's your grandmother? - About the same, unfortunately. - That's too bad. - Listen, adam, i know i've been here a week already. All right, but i'm gonna need more time. - No, hey, don't-- Don't even worry about it. - A week, ten days, max. - What's the good news? - Well, there's a huge tax lien against the b&b, And it just gets worse from there. - I mean, just remember you walked away From helmand province in one piece. - Point taken. Look i gotta go, all right? I got a lunch. - Don't lie to me, circus pony. I know you got a date with chelsea. - It's mayor chelsea to you. - The mayor? - It's not with her. - I got my eye on you, airborne. - Mm, mm-Kay. I have missed this apple pie. - Mm, it is so good. Thank you for treating me to lunch. It is very considerate of you Considering everything else you have going on. - There's something very liberating About being this deeply in debt. Well, you're just talking about cupid's, right? - Yeah. Well, i'm not exactly rolling in it, either. I saved enough of my army pay to make a fresh start, But that's it. Believe me, if i had the money, i'd pay the tax myself, But i don't. And that makes me worry about my grandmother, And steve, and sandra. What happens to them if i can't pay? - Well, i'm sure the property is worth more than the tax lien. - Am i seriously gonna have to start thinking about selling? - You may have to. - It's my grandmother's life. - You're a good grandson. - I don't feel like one today. There he is. Arrest that...cherub. - Okay. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to fool anyone that you want. And you have the right to stay away from me, okay? - Wow. - You're as bitter as i am. Wow. - You're bitter, tommy? - Well, only-- Only about this much. But nothing for you to worry about. What are you doing here? - Well, we're old friends. Thought i'd come by and say "hi," You know, see how you're doing. You're doing fine, i see. Officer. - Mayor. - You work fast. We should catch up. But this obviously isn't the time. I put my private number on the back. Call me. And welcome home, soldier. - That was interesting. . I-I actually had a good time on our non-Date. - Yeah? - Mm-Hmm. - Me too. - Well... Welcome home, soldier. - I thought this was a non-Date. There's no kissing on a non-Date. - Can i blame it on cupid? - Cupid's not real. Sorry. Look, i told you before I'm not looking for a relationship. - I'm not either. Just someone to talk to who understands. - Hm. That would be me. And that i would like. Deal? - Deal. - I'm gonna go visit another patient. You don't need me because you're doing so well. - Oh, thank you. - But i'll come visit you tomorrow. - All right. - Dr. Gray. - Ah. Tom. - Hi. - Hi, welcome home. I'm sorry i missed you the last few times you were in. - It's good to be back. So how is she? - Well, you know, she's been in and out of the hospital For the past couple of years. She's old. You get to be her age, your systems start to fail. - But she-- She's gonna be okay? - Oh. Tom, your grandma's pretty important To an awful lot of people around here, including me. We're doing our best. And you being here Has really helped improve her spirits. So just keep that up. Hm? Keep her happy. - How's cu-- Cupid's is fine. Steve and sandra have it running smoothly, Waiting for you to get back. - I'm not concerned about steve and sandra. It's you i'm worried about. - You should be more worried about you And when you're getting outta here. - I want you to be happy. - I'll tell you what. I'll make a deal with you. As soon as you're well enough to get outta here, I'll be ecstatic. - You are so frustrating. - I know. - I need to know what your plans are. Do you know? - I wish i did. - You do know what you want. You just have to recognize it. - It's not that easy, grandma. - It is that easy. Your heart will show you the way. - Right this way, please, mr. Campbell. Thank you. - Mm-Hmm. Thomas. I'm so happy that you called. Sit. - Thanks. Yeah, i just wanna get this over with. - Over with? - Yeah, whatever it is you want from me. - Come on, that's ancient history. Today is what matters, right? - Spoken like a true politician. - You know, you've changed, thomas. I like the new you. - You're doing pretty well yourself. What do you want? - I'm not really sure now. - What did you want? - To talk to you about cupid's. - Why? It's not mine. - Well, you're running it, right? Are you staying? Do you wanna sell it? - Why is everyone asking me that? - Well, it's-- It's a community asset. - You want to keep it a community asset? You're the mayor. Help me with my tax problem. - Tax problem? Oh, jerry. You know, we must really live right. Cupid's has an insurmountable tax problem That i'm gonna pretend to try to help fix. - So dish. - He told me everything. I told you i could handle him. He'll get grandma to sell. He'll have to. Okay, you sure you want to tackle this with me? Yeah, i'm sure. Those pipes are driving me nuts. I'll be happy to tackle this thing with you. Where do we start? - Call in a real plumber. - We already have a $92,000 bill. We gotta fix this thing ourselves. It could just be the pump. All right. Uh, Let's say we turn off the water and look at the pump. - You're the boss. Huh. - Okay. - Whoa. - Okay. - That cannot be good. Here, turn it-- Turn it back on. - Turn it back on! Both: ah! - Oh. - Oh, hi. Take this for a free night next time. Have a safe trip. Yes. Here, here. We'll be back up and running in no time. I'm sorry. Have a great, safe trip. Ee. - That'd be great. Thanks. - Hey. - Hey. That was the plumber. - Cool. - Yeah. He can't come out until tomorrow. He didn't want to give an estimate over the phone. But he sounded very happy when i described the damage. - That's not good. - So we got no money coming in. We got more than we can afford going out. You've--You've been here since as long as i can remember. What did grandma do during times like this? - Never had any. - Thanks. Great. We're booked. We're completely full. - Mm-Hmm. Your mom and dad would be so proud of you. You've become such a fine, strong man. - Yeah. Thank you for that. You know, sometimes Overseas at night, i would-- I would try to remember them. And i-I can't. I just-- I just can't. - No, you were--You were so young, darling, and-- When they had that terrible accident. But they loved you so much. Always remember that. - I will. I love you. Thank you. - No, thank you, homer. I know it's public record, but i appreciate You cutting some of the red tape for me. - Sure, mayor. Anything else i can do for you? - You know, i might have a couple more questions About this, so you keep that file close. Okay? - Yes, ma'am. Will do. Have a nice day. - Okay, bye. Cupid's is toast. You could lower your price by a third And i bet he still takes it. He's in way over his head. - No time like the present. - No, no. You be gentle on him. He's about to lose his grandma. I might want to swoop in and pick up the pieces. Sounds like a win-Win. Oh, that's not good. - Wow. All right, why don't you take the car back? I'm gonna see if he needs help. And i'll just get him to give me a ride home. - Tom! - I wouldn't do that if you like those shoes. - Ah. They belong to the city. Thank you. - I'm open to ideas here. - Did you call a plumber? - Good one. - All right, well, my dad used to be in construction. And he said do what you can Before you turn it over to a specialist. - Meaning? - Meaning they're gonna come out here, Dig a trench, and charge you an arm and a leg for it. - Let's get to work. - You got it. - Anybody out here? - Yeah, we're back here. Be careful. Be careful. That's raw sewage. - I have something i'd like to discuss with you. - Watch your step. We had a little... - Whoa! - Plumbing accident. - Oh! Oh. Come on, give me your hand. - Yeah, just keep crawling. - Atta boy. What are you doing here? I am here to buy your property and your business. I have got a generous offer for you. - Look, don't worry about it. We're--I'm not looking to sell. - What are you talking about? You have to sell. - I'm sorry. Who are you, again? - A man that can make all of your problems go away. - What do you know about my problems? - Nothing, just that everyone has problems. I ha--I have problems. I have a lot of problems. - Like i said, it's not for sale. - All right. Then i guess i'll be going. Thank you. - You're welcome. - I wanna know who that guy is. - Maybe you can get the cops to find out. - Oh, yeah? - Oh, yeah. - What happened? - I fell into a mud hole. - No, i don't care what happened to you. Is he interested in selling or not? - No, but i wasn't exactly at my best. - Well, what did he say? - I'm pretty sure it was something Along the lines of, "hey, i'm not gonna sell." You know what? If that lady cop hadn't been there, I would have a lawsuit on my hands, Forced him to sell. - A lady cop? - Yeah. - Do you think there's something going on there? - At the hotel? Something illegal? You know, that might be a good angle. - Between tom and the cop! - I have no idea. Maybe. Want me to find out? I can do that. - What i want you to do is get out of the building. Go, go home. Take a shower. Burn your clothes. - Yes, ma'am. - Sally, hi. Can you get me the employment files on the new lady cop? - You mean nancy? - Sure. - She's so nice. - Yes, i'm sure she's very nice. - Yes, ma'am, i'll get right on it. - Thank you. - Ah, tommy. - I didn't wanna wake you.

As soon as you're ready, i'll drive you myself. You're such a sweet boy, tommy. You don't have to stay, dear. Let this old lady get her beauty rest. - I love you, grams. Mm. - Good night, you sweet boy. - Good night. - What a mess. Entire system, huh? The house too? - Yeah. Well, i know a guy. He could fix it. - Yeah? - Give you a good price. Won't be cheap. It'll be good, though. - By your wedding day? - He's good but he's not that good. Well, what are we gonna do? We--We still gotta have the wedding out here. I mean, not just because susie wants it.

Thanks. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. - Okay, so, i mean, he came out of nowhere. And he was extremely interested in buying cupid's. - But you have no idea who he is? - Mm. None. - Well, that's gonna make him a lot tougher to find, nancy. - Gil, i need your help on this one. - Okay, um, well, If he needed any public records, He's gonna have to go to city hall. - Okay. And then what would a good detective do? - Check the visitors' logs. - Bingo. - All right, detective gil's on the scent. - You know i love that. - You wanted to see me? Jerry. Your boss called. And he asked if i had seen you lately Because he hasn't. - I told you i'm working on a project. - And even though you think i don't remember What i tell you, i told you, "run it by bill." - I just wanted to have all my ducks in a row first. - Just run it by bill. Now, i'm not kidding. - Whatever you say. I'll be happy to. That it? - Jerry. Now, i wanna know. What are you doing? - What are you talking about? - You're hiding something from me, jerry.

Yeah. - You gotta talk to him. Look, tom, no matter what you decide, I know your grandmother would approve. Thank you, brother. Okay. Where do we get $92,000? I paid the funeral expenses. What's left is barely enough to pay for the plumbing. Bless her heart, she ran this place like a nonprofit. - Did she have any insurance? - I can't find a policy anywhere. Did she have a lawyer? - No. Are you kidding? What about a loan on the property? As soon as i'm legal owner, the bank will talk. The problem is the will won't get settled for months. - Look at you two sad sacks. - We're trying to figure out a way to raise some money. - And in the meantime, kip's wedding is on. So let's say we go out with a bang. - Stop that. We're not going anywhere. Hm. - Hm. - Uh, he's a cop. And, i mean, he wasn't the first man i was in love with. But i thought he'd be the last. - Soul mates. - No. No such thing. Did i think so at the time, though? Yeah, 1,000%. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Sounds pretty serious. - Yeah, i had a wedding dress. We picked out a date. I mean, it was all the fairy-Tale stuff. - And what happened? - Bethany. - Bethany. - Yeah, a real fairy-Tale princess. A damsel in distress wrapped in ribbons and bows, A girl to hang on his every word And follow him around like a puppy dog. - Yeah, but if he chose that over you, you're lucky. Well, i would agree with you. But every time i've been dumped, It's been for a bethany. - Yeah, i've had my own bethany issues. - And she chose being mayor over you? - Yeah, for starters. I think world domination is her ultimate goal. - What's your goal? - That's the same thing chelsea asked me The day she dumped me. - Yeah, officer fairfax. Hey, sally. Uh-Huh. Uh, okay. 3:00 pm? Okay, great. I will see you then. - Hm. - Bye. Well, i've just been summoned by the queen of the world. - Really? - Really. - Chief. - Bill. Hey, sal. - Hi, chief. Uh, chief? - Yeah? - Can i talk to you for a second? - Sure. What's up? - It's about nancy and mayor gibson. - What about nancy and mayor gibson? - Okay, so then legally, What options do we have to force them To pay the tax bill now? - The quickest is a 15-Day demand notice. Are you sure you want me to do that? - I know. Could you believe it? - It's crazy. - And then they came-- - Good afternoon, anna. - Hi, kip. - Hey, chief. How are ya? - Hey, nance? - Yeah? - Got a minute? - You bet, chief. What's up? - I-Our mayor just requested A copy of your file. - Ah. As well as my presence in her office. - Really? - Mm-Hmm. - Hm. You want me to go with you? - Do you know something i don't? - No, i was just-- She didn't exactly go through The proper channels on this one. - Huh. Well, that's because i have a feeling it's personal. Every time she's seen me recently, it's been with tom. - Ah, okay. Well... Just remember that i got your back on this And that you work for me, not her. - Thank you. But if it is personal, i'll let her know What boundaries she can and cannot cross. - That a girl. - How you doing, chief? - Hey, gil. - Ready to get to work? - Yeah, thank you. - All right, you guys be careful out there. - Yes, sir. - You got it, chief. - You were right about the visitors' log. - Oh, yeah? - Found our guy. It was easier than i thought. I knew most everybody else who was signing in. - Oh, yeah? Who is he? - Jerry tollen. Multiple times. And every time he comes in, He comes to see the mayor. He works for tollen industries. - What's that? - They develop properties. Huge company. He's the son of the ceo. - Wow. That is very useful information. Thank you, gil. That helps a lot. - Okay. - Look, we started off on the wrong foot. - I'll listen to your offer, but i don't want to sell. - And that is as short-Sided as a man gets, no offense. - What's your name, by the way? - Jerry. Jerry tollen. - Yeah, oh-- Okay, mr. Tollen. What's your offer? - Tom. - He's not leaving until we hear him out. Go on. Give me your best shot. Boom. - This is more than i thought. Why? - It is a successful business On a beautiful piece of property. - I'll hold on to this, but i don't want to sell. - That offer has a very short shelf life, Just so we're clear. - I understand. - Okay then. - Was it that much? Wow. - Yeah. - He's doing well in his work, isn't he? - Yeah, that's what i heard. Come in. - You wanted to see me? - Yes. Uh, please sit. - I'd prefer to stand. Thank you. - Okay. Well, i've been looking through your file. And you, my dear, have a lot of potential. - Thank you, ms. Mayor. I am on duty, so what is it exactly I could help you with? - There's no need to be rude. - Certainly not trying to offend you. I'm just not quite sure what i'm doing here. - Let's cut to the chase. - Thank you. - What is the nature Of your relationship with thomas? - He's a good friend and a good man. - And there's nothing... - Romantic? No. And i'm just a friend trying to help him Through a very difficult time. - Well, if you'd like to help thomas, You could start by convincing him To sell the bed and breakfast Before he loses it all to his tax bid And is left with nothing. You could do that for me. And then, maybe later on if you ever needed anything, I could do something for you. - I see. Well, i'm sure thomas will be flattered you care so much. As for me, there is actually something i need. - See, now this is the stuff That relationships are built on. - What is the nature of your relationship With mr. Jerry tollen? I think it's time for you to leave. - Hm. Thank you, ms. Mayor. - We have to stop meeting like this. - Well, i called you. And you didn't answer your phone. - Well, i had my phone off 'Cause i need time to think. - Maybe this will help. I found out that chelsea and that jerry guy, They're working together to buy cupid's. Of course they are. That makes perfect sense. I don't see where that matters, though. The assessor called today. I have 15 days to pay. After that, They take the property. - There's gotta be a reason why they want it so bad. - It doesn't matter. They're offering me a profit, The assessor isn't, And i have to pay the bill. - Well, we still have 15 days. - We? - Stand up. Arms where i can see 'em. Now. - Are you crazy? - You heard me. Stand up. Arms where i can see 'em. This is your last warning. - What'd i say? - Are you carrying any weapons? - Have you completely lost your mind? - I don't want you to sell because... I don't want you to leave. - You sure about this? - I know i said never, But i guess this is as long As never lasts. I'm starting to love this place again. - Yeah. - But i have to take 'em up on their offer. I don't see any other way. - And you're sure you don't wanna fight? - Yeah, i've done enough fighting for one lifetime. If i sell, i give sandra and steve what's left, And i'll just tell them to get the paperwork ready. And i'll sign it after their wedding. Jerry, tom campbell. Call me. We need to talk. I feel awful about this, you two. I just don't see any other way. - Look, you've taken the only avenue left open to you. - I mean, we get it. We saw this coming. - Hey, believe me. I racked my brain trying to come up With a solution for you. - Nah, for us. Come on. I have too. And i feel responsible for your futures, Which is why i'm gonna make sure That you two are taken care of financially. And i don't want to hear any arguments about it. Grandma would insist. Everything's been such a struggle since i got back. - Everything? - Yeah. No, you? You were a complete surprise. - Huh. - Don't get me wrong. You were a great surprise. Best i ever got. - Better be. Well, do you wanna take a walk on the beach? - I need to be alone there tonight. - I totally get it. Can i bring you breakfast? - Absolutely. - Okay. - Thank you. - Good night. - Nancy. - Gil. - Hey. Was that tom i saw? - Yeah. He's headed to cupid's to say his good-Byes. - Oh. Sad. - Yeah. - Hey, i gotta return a couple of dvds. You wanna keep me company? - Yeah. I'd love to. - Hi, this is tom. Wha-- No. No, absolutely not. Okay, where? I'll be there in 15 minutes. - What's the emergency? - You weren't here. Oh, come on, thomas. Don't be like that. - I can't believe i came here. - I can. We used to be best friends. Remember? Please just sit with me. - And after that, we go our separate ways. - If you still feel like that when we're done, That's how it'll be. - Oh, that's how it'll be. - Wow. Army made you a tough guy. - Not as tough as you made me. - You know, i've relived that moment A million times in my mind, Thinking about you... - So you decided to show me By buying my property out from under me? - By helping you with your debt. I'm not making any money on this deal. Jerry is a developer and a friend. It benefits both of you. - I guess i had been assuming the worst. - Yeah, when there was no need to. Friends? The marine layer's blowing in. - I'm actually a little bit chilly. - I'm actually a little bit cold. The great bicycle race. - Oh, i've never laughed harder Than when i saw you go face first into those bushes. - Until i came out. - I did not mean for you to get hurt. - I know. - You healed up so nicely, though. - I have to get out of here. - Come on, nancy. There's gotta be a reasonable explanation for this. - There is. Bethany. - Bethany. - I needed this. Thank you. I gotta go. All right? I got some loose ends to tie up at cupid's. You have a great night. - Sorry, thomas. It's not over until i say it's over. I'm not gonna do it. - Go for real deal. - I made a decision. This place is my family's legacy. - You don't have to explain it to me, bro. I get it. - I'm gonna stay and fight. Talked to the employees. They're in. - Well, that's not surprising. You're a-- You're a good leader. So what's next? - I gotta make a plan. The good news is i'm surrounded by problems. - I like it, you can attack from any direction. - Maybe there's a girl involved. - It's not the mayor, is it? - She's a cop. - Outstanding. She gets that law enforcement discount. - Yeah. I feel like i'm letting you down. - I'm proud of you. I mean, you'd be a lousy bodyguard anyway. - I'll come school you sometime. Be careful out there, ranger. - Never. Out. - Hey, you, thought you were bringing breakfast. Listen, call me back when you get this, okay? I've made some decisions. - Okay. - Call me. Ladies, would you mind finishing up Your last-Minute wedding plans with sandra? I've really got to take care of something. - Sure, it's just little things. Take off. I gotta go in a couple minutes anyway. - Yeah, tom, go. We'll be fine. I am so excited. - Oh, it's gonna be great. - And it's gonna be everything you want. I promise. Thank you. - Thank you for deciding not to sell. - Yeah. I don't know how we're gonna do it. 15 days isn't much time. - You gotta believe. That boy needs to learn how to turn off the lights. Steve? Yeah? - Come here. - Whoa. - Take a look. - Hm. What's going on? - Go get your phone. Go, go, go, go. Okay. Okay. - Lieutenant? - Hey. - You shouldn't be here. I'm on duty. - What is going on? I saw you and chelsea together last night After you said you were going home. - Okay. Okay. Okay, sit down. Sit down. Please. All right. Okay. She called me and said it was an emergency. That's all. You gotta trust me here. - No, i do. I-I do trust you in my heart. It's my head i can't shut off. Tom, i'm not ready. And i may never be ready. It's not fair to you. - I'm not selling cupid's. - Really? - Yeah. But i can't explain here. Okay? I gotta show you. Come on. Come on. - Tom, i... - What? - I'm really mixed up about this. I-I think it's better We go our separate ways. I'm sorry. Give her some time. No, i'm cursed. And yet, here i am trying to save The very thing that cursed me. Wow. - Stop it. You gotta believe. - No, no, no. Hey, i believed once. That was enough. I came across some of grandma's old records And pictures of people Whose lives she changed forever All because they believed in this place like she did. How can i not carry that on? Because if i don't, her legacy dies. And i'm not gonna let that happen. - That's the tom i know. Go on. - Hey, where's steve? - Um, running some errands for me. - Sorry. - Hi. - Jerry, tom campbell. Listen, i've decided not to sell the property. I'm gonna try and save it. - What? No. We had a deal. A deal, okay? Even though we don't have a written contract, You'll spend so much money on lawyers, you'll go broke. I have got corporate attorneys and deep pockets, okay? You can't win. - Individual waters on the tables. - Okay, got 'em right here. - Hey. So there's no running water. So direct anybody that needs them To the porta-Potties and the sinks behind the house. Both: mm-Hmm. - Thanks. - Oh, sure. - You have one new message. - Nancy, call me. Please. Come see me.

Listen, jerry says if you don't sign the papers, He'll sue you. I don't think you have a choice. - Let him sue me. I didn't sign anything. - He's bringing a corporate attorney here to serve you. Thomas, just settle. Thomas. - No, no. This is my cousin's wedding. Don't do this. Do you remember when you told me i didn't have any goals? Well, now i got two. One, to return this place to its former glory. Two, nancy. - Thomas, those are not goals. Those are dead ends. You know, maybe you should just run away again. Maybe that would be best for everyone. - One of the real joys Of being an ordained minister Is performing marriages, Especially when the bride and groom Are your friends, like kip and susie. I'll get you through it. - I know you will. - Holy matrimony is a beautiful thing. It's the joining together of two kindred spirits In this very special place. And now the sand ceremony, The merging of two elements into one new thing. Kip and susie... You may kiss the bride. It gives me great pleasure to present to you Mr. And mrs. Kip campbell. - Whoo! - Oh, great. Perfect timing. It'll be okay. I promise. - Look, i am not kidding. This is the big leagues. I will have you in court tomorrow. And by the time i'm done with you, Your grandkids will owe me. - Okay, my cousin is out there Celebrating his wedding day, My chief of police cousin. I'm not gonna let you ruin this day for me. Get off my property now. - Well, enjoy your property now Because this time tomorrow, it'll be mine. - Tom, you have to see this. Come on. - Wh... What is this? Who are all these people? They weren't at the wedding. - Your grandmother's legacy. - What? - I found the ledger with all the names on your desk. And steve and i called them all.

Mom. - What are you doing here? - Uh... This is it. This is my project. - And what is your project? - I had a deal to buy this dump from him. But then he welched on the deal. That's why i brought edward. - And what were we going to do with this property? - Do we really have to talk about this here? - Well, if it's gonna be a company asset, yes. - Look, there is something that you don't know. There is something that nobody else knows. They are going to build a new highway right here. - Oh, that's insider information. - It's just business. - Yeah, well, it's not my business. No, jerry, we don't trade in illegal information. - Oh, i-I think you don't understand. It's actually for the good of the community. - Yeah. - It's all part of my plan. - Mm-Hmm. - You know, progress. - Progress. - So you're part of this fraud too? - Uh-- - You the new owner? - I am.

No. No--Dad, this is my deal. - You know, perhaps it was me that failed you. I turned you loose and expected you to perform. And that's not being a very good boss or a very good father. - Really? - Tell you what. You wanna learn how to do things the right way? I'm ready to help you. - Yeah, i'd like that. - Yeah. - Besides, it was her idea anyway. - I don't have to take this. - It was payable to... - Thank you so much. - Thank you. - Ah, thank you so much. - Lovely to see you again. - Nice to see you. - Oh. - Look at them. - Still romantic.

And what's your reason? - Oh, well, the issuing officer cleary displayed An abusive power when she coerced me With her charm and her beauty. - And you think a judge will believe that? - As soon as he takes one look at the officer? Oh, yeah. - Huh. - I called bethany. We had a long talk. And it turns out she's a pretty cool girl. I also found out he left her... For a charlotte. Guess what. - What? - I'm not afraid of charlottes.
