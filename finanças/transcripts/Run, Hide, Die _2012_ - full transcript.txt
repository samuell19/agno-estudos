You're alone? Yeah. You know what you want? I'll take the venison please. ...this morning at the Jacob River Community Center for the victims of a tragic event last Friday which is now being referred to as the Nace Family Massacre. Friends and family of the deceased gathered at the community center today to-- the murders which took place Friday evening. Said the family interviewed that the Nace family was your All-American family. It just doesn't make sense. An emotional wave of distress has rocked the small community, causing many citizens to stay indoors and take time off work to be with their family. Although a thorough investigation is underway, police say they have made no arrests at this time. Motivations for the murders has been subject of many conversations this week, in whether or not they are linked to the murder of a family member, Alex Nace. ...occurred exactly a year ago from the crimes of Friday evening. The shooting one year prior is still untold, leaving many to wonder if the shooter just came back to finish the job. Need anything else? Ma'am? No, thank you. Oh! Touchdown, yeah! Sorry, I have a cheese ball in my mouth, what up? Hey, Indy. Addie? - You okay? - Yeah... Could you come over? Hey sweetie, I stopped by on my way to the airport. Janet called to see how you're doing. Jim said their cabin's free and that you're more than welcome to go up there with your friends for the weekend. Tomorrow it will be a year. You have to move on. Speaking of moving on... What's this? Ugh, my mom dropped that off with flowers this morning. I guess she was talking to Janet on the phone and they both thought it'd be a bad idea for me to stay here this weekend, so I guess Jim offered up his cabin. Alex's dad offered that? That's a huge step, actually. All right, extreme camping trip! We can take Wilma! Call the other girls and see if they wanna go. You mean you wanna invite other girls on our date? I thought we could have an orgy. You know, the usual. As long as I can be the big spoon. You can be the big spoon. And you make the other sluts sleep in the wet spot. Gross! So where's this cabin anyway? It's out near Concrete. So who are we inviting? Anyone who wants to come. On my chest? Dude... Okay. Welcome back. See ya later! You left your home at five in the evening? Why can't you people just do your fucking jobs? Ma'am, I assure you our investigation is continuing. There's a process we have to follow-- Stop. You don't know what's right in front of you! Addison Nace? You left your home and proceeded to one Ariel Jackson's. What, are we dropping you off at a frat party? It's a quarter mile hike to the cabin, you're gonna wear that? Fuck you, pirate hat is coming. - It's extra weight. - You're extra weight! Could you not be an asshole for like five minutes? Dude, that'd be like asking the wind not to blow. So Billy still lives in her grandma's place, right? Yeah. Oh, and I invited Gina, I hope that's okay. And she's at Billy's, so we can kill two birds. Well, I have a surprise guest as well. - Santa? - Nope. Bill Murray. Ariel. Ariel? She lives! Depends on what film she's doing. Hot, so what she been up to lately? Just doing the Indy Hollywood thing. Sucks though, 'cause we never get to see her. She's always either rehearsing or filming something. Lame. Shit! What up, biatch? How did you get back there without me seeing you? I snuck her in there when you got to my house. You know, had I known you were back there, I would have at least lied to you. Aw, Indy, you're not a very good liar. - Yes I am! - No you're not. - Okay, two truths and a lie. - Okay. All right, one, I'm allergic to alcohol. Two, I put on deodorant this morning, and three, I have to poop. - Well, that was easy. - Okay. You are not allergic to alcohol. - Yes I am. - No, you're not! Yes, I am. Every time I drink I break out in handcuffs, woo! Oh,,you're so retarded! You cheated! I didn't. How do you know the other two aren't true? Well, I can smell you from here, so I know you didn't put on deodorant-- Hey. You probably pooped before you left. Nope, I have to poop. Wait, so which one's the lie? Neither, I lied about lying. Fucking cheater! You're just mad because I'm a better actress than you. Oh, speaking of acting... I brought my scripts along. What's this for? A horror film called Eating Revenge! Is that whore with a w? Oh, yeah, absolute whore. Wait, can I rehearse it with you? Yeah! Oh, this is gonna sound super nerdy, but I actually brought a video camera. So dangerous. I was hoping you guys could film a couple of my scenes with me? That way I can see what I look like so I don't look completely retarded when I actually film. So cliché, a hot chick. I know, right? No, no, you need bigger boobs. Just wait, I'm gonna be famous as fuck and you're gonna take back every comment. No, because then you'll have money to buy fake ones. Fuck you. Gina, they're here! Hey, what's up, motherfuckers? Really? The slow clap? Really? Could have been the other clap. Dude, if you weren't such a klutz, you wouldn't get the slow clap. Or the other clap. Hey Addie, you're out of the fucking house. Yeah. Oh, balls, I forgot my pillow. Fuck you, assholes! Hey, guys! Hey, look at those legs, they go right up and make an ass out of themselves. Indy! Hey. Hey, Addison. Welcome of the dead, huh? You don't smell like death. Well, I showered! I had no idea that death smelled like a baby shitting vinegar until I started this job. Well put! Learned it from the best. The best pervert. No, the best English to sexting truth translator. Douche-aye. Yes, we're gonna bring Wilma? Wilma, will my van start? Cute hats! Thanks, we tried to dress up for you. Damn, the whole crew? Even Ariel. I know, it was so last minute. It was just meant to be. Goodbye, Billy! What? Bye, be careful, take care! Bye, grandma! Now remember, if life gives you lemons, squeeze it all over yourself and then find somebody to lick it off! Bye, grandma! ♪ So when did my cure for you ♪ ♪ Become a kiss from you ♪ ♪ So when did my cure for you ♪ Dude, I was almost asleep! That's why we were being so loud. It's a fucking road trip, dude! I know, let's all play the silent game. Billy's the worst carpool buddy ever, she always just passes out. Hey, we should stop for food. And I have to pee. Where are we gonna stop this car, I need to get out of here! Yeah, I have to go to the bathroom. Bathroom? Do you wanna see my face poop? No, no! Put your fucking pooper away, no one wants to see that! Phew. It's hot. I don't know... So how do you guys wanna split up the gas money? Ass, gas, or grass. - Ass! Ass! - Grass! What, me too? You especially. Fine. Seriously? Wait... Seriously? Starving artist. I don't have enough money to have the luxury of organizing it yet. All right. Until I am famous as fuck. Oh, you mean until you fuck someone famous. Ooh! Dude, I didn't know your boyfriend worked at a gas station. Oh, fuck you! Come on, that short one's kind of cute. You should go flirt with him. - Dare me? - Yeah, I do. Hello! Hi! It is hot out there! You don't happen to sell any cold beverages that I can cool off with, do you? Gas and smokes only! Where's the bathroom? I gotta squeeze a lemon. Outside, second door. You okay? Yeah. Yeah. You sure? Yeah, no, I'm fine. Okay. I'm gonna go see what the other girls want. Do you mind pumping the gas? Yeah, sure. - Hey guys! - Oh, my gosh! So you guys probably already know this, but a year ago today is when Alex... Yeah, that's what I was thinking. So we just need to be cool. I'm sure she'll wanna talk about it, but just in case. She's kind of emotional, you know? So what exactly happened to Alex? Addison spent the night at my place one night. Her and Alex had gotten into a fight. When she got home the next day, their place had been broken into and she found Alex dead in her bedroom. Oh, my gosh. Wow, don't sugarcoat it or anything. But it was a fucked-up situation, okay? Plus the way his family treated her after was fucked! They fucking blamed her for it. Someone had been watching the place, just walks right in. Imagine being asleep and you hear them stepping slowly towards the bedroom. You see a shadow grow on the ground next to you, falling through the door frame. You see fingers crawl around the side of the door and suddenly... You fucking asshole! Bitch! I hate you! Gross! Oh, what the fuck? I am not going in there. What, you don't want gonorrhea? Long story short, Alex spooked a burglar and the guy shot him in the head. That's awful. Yeah, I know. It was horrible, let's go! Okay, okay, hold up! Hey. You told me to call if they stopped by. Seriously, we are out in the middle of bumfuck! Keep running, it's not gonna change your face! Keep it up! Go, woohoo! Oh, my God, now he was hot! Hey, was that your brother? Now he is gross, God! I think I would even do him. Hey, hey, this is it. All right, let's make like horseshit and hit the trail. Bless you! Fucking allergies. Thanks for coming, guys. Oh, my gosh, we're here! Glory! For a movie star, you don't get out very much. I am too busy being famous. Do you even get paid for your gigs? Yeah, I do, I just... Not as much as if I were in LA. Yeah, why don't you move to LA? LA is so fake, I don't wanna be stabbed in the back by people I trust. So you'd rather stay here and get stabbed in the front by people you trust. Yeah. Are you going to war or something? Yeah, yeah... No, we're going hunting! We're gonna get a raccoon and make you a new hat! I'm gonna shoot a deer, and then Gina's gonna cut it up, and we're gonna eat it! What, nuh uh! Humans yes, animals no. Okay, I could kill a fucker. Okay. Damn, it is beautiful up here. Yeah, it is so beautiful. Seriously, Addison, good idea having us come up here. Yeah, great idea! Do you have any thoughts of your own? Shut up. Leave her alone, she has lots of good ideas. Where should we go? This is it. What? Oh, my God. This is it. Wow. Oh, wow. Hey, is that it? I was really worried I was gonna have to poop outside. No, I think they have a bathroom. Wow, Alex used to come up here with his dad all the time. Oh, we have got to capture this moment. Line up right over there. Okay ladies, get your smiles ready! Of course you would do that. I can't believe we've never been here before. This place is rad! Man, I want a fucking cabin! Ariel, when you're famous, will you buy me a cabin? Yes. I am starving, are you guys hungry? I could eat. Nice! Easy Noodle! Wasn't that your nickname in high school? - Ariel! - Oh, my God, I didn't know it was open! Ariel! I didn't mean to! Yeah, but I did! Oh, my God. Holy shit. You guys are freaking me out. Yeah, she's not lying. Remember her 24th birthday? She pissed through my whole mattress! It was dripping all over the place like a fucking lake had birthed itself on my floor. By the time I realized it, people were already canoeing on it. Are you serious? How come I never heard about this? I remember that. That was of course after I found her drinking ranch dressing on the kitchen floor. Hey, it was a good night. From what I can remember. Yeah, for you, Drunky Mc-Wets-Herself. Remember I saran wrapped her bed after that? Speaking of which... I don't wanna know. Ta-da! You brought me a sack lunch! Addison, come in here before Billy and Indy drink all the booze! All right, cheers everyone? Oh, yes, cheers! To a fabulous weekend and my fabulous cousin. Single and sexy as hell! Yes, here here! Yes, Ma'am! Guys, so I have a script. If you wanna read it through with me? You don't have to act. You can just read it out loud. I just need to know what I look like so I don't look like a total tard later when I'm actually filming, you know what I mean? No, we should act it out! You guys are totally gonna make fun of it. I play a prostitute who works for a hitman. I lure his victims in with sex and then he follows me back to their place and kills them. Kills them dead. Nice. Well, whatever, we just wanna hear you doing that stuff. Thank you! Indy, you can play man number one, the man I seduce, who takes me back to his place. Twist my arm! Move! Ow, God. You wanna be in it? Oh, no, it's okay, I'll just watch. Oh, wait, I will film. I wanna be in it. Okay, you can be the hitman. What about me? I don't think there are any other characters. There's a dog. Oh, fuck you! Well, he plays a big part in it! Okay, Gina, you can stay there because you're not in the scene yet. All right. And Indy and I are just about to have sex. Growl. Okay, ready... Action! Hello, dear. Dear? Who calls the person they're trying to seduce "dear"? That's like something your grandma would say, like, "Oh, hello, dear." What are you, an 80-year-old pedophile? No. Hello, dear. How much to do whatever I want? 500 will get you the whole night. How do you like it? Hard. None of that making love bullshit! You asked for it. All right, I need another drink. Hey, we are not done, I haven't even said my lines! Nope, can't finish, writing sucks. How many movies have you been in? Thank you! Yeah, you know, sometimes the hardest part of acting is acting that the script doesn't suck. Shut up! Just saying. Whatever. Hey, where you going? For booze. And appreciation! Adjust the camera angle. Okay. You couldn't wait for me to grab it? If you're trying to scare me, it's not gonna work! Billy? Fuck. You fucking bitch. Is that the end of the film? Well, that's the end of the dialogue in that scene. The film ends with the hitman killing the guy, cutting him up, cooking him, and then feeding him to the guy's dog. What? Are you serious? Who thinks of that shit? That's awesome. Feeds the guy to his dog. I know it's ridiculous, but I like to be in these kind of films 'cause I get to do shit that I don't do in real life, you know? What happens to your character? A guy we're trying to kill stabs me. You know, just another normal day for me. I hate it when that happens. I always die in films. I'd love to live to the end for once or play the heroine instead of the dumb hot girl. Stop getting yourself typecast then. Indiana Jones! Ow! How'd you get down here so fast? What, I left five minutes ago. You did not! Where'd you find this? Let me see that. This is mine! That creepy fucking thing? What happened to its face? It must have ended up in one of Alex's boxes that Jan took. Wait, so you've been down here the whole time? Yeah. Oh, here's your beer. So when you go to put it in your mouth... There's still a big fucking gnarly hair in your food! You can try to eat around it or you can just trade it in for a new one. Yeah, I don't miss dicks. Dicks are like awkward Christmas presents. Yeah, you have the package all built up in your head, it's something you really want and you peek downstairs and either way either way you gotta pretend like you like it so you don't hurt the other person's feelings. Oh, here, Bill, I'll pick you one. So how long have you guys been together now, Ariel, a year? One year. I was working at the Suds Up Soap store in the mall and we were handing out samples and he came by. So I thought he was hot, so I gave him a handful. Shut up! And? And so we got caught up talking and he thought I had given him candy, so he popped one in his mouth. But he was so embarrassed that he acted like he meant to do it and he chewed it up and swallowed it. Oh, my... See, that's when you should have known there was something wrong. No, it was so funny! Didn't he get sick? Oh, yeah. Ew, I bet he had the worst shits ever. Like slip and slide shits. Wiping for him must've been like getting peanut butter out of shag carpet. That is so gross. Or maybe it just cleaned out his system and he had one big Titanic shit. Titanic shit? Yeah, you know, like the one that's so big that you have to flush it once to break the shit in half. Ew, ew! Wait, so this incident made you want to date him, that's why you're with him? Yeah, it was so funny. Do you think he blew bubbles out of his ass? Oh, just fuck you guys! Oh, no, no! Officer down! Officer down! I'm really glad you came. Me too. Oh, it's all hairy. Just like I like it. Ew. I'm sorry. Any last words? Well, you got shit all over it! You pooped on my wiener? What? You pooped on my wiener, you hairy wiener pooper! Oh, here, will you put a hot dog on mine? Taking too long. Oh, shit! Bedtime, anyone? Yeah, that sounds good. I'll sleep on the couch. Where are Gina and Indy sleeping? On each other? Mmm, it's so good. What are you doing? I'm calling my mom, I forgot to call her and thank her for the flowers. Hey, mom. Hi, honey, I was wondering where you were. Sorry. I took your advice and we went up to Jim's cabin, it's been really awesome. You're at Jim's cabin? Yeah, oh, and thank you for the flowers, that was really nice of you. Flowers? What are you talking about, I didn't drop off any flowers. You didn't? No, did someone give you flowers? But that doesn't make any sense because I got a card from you that said that-- Mom? Mom! What the fuck... What's going on? Nothing, I'm just tired. I'm fine. Hey, you got there today, this was the tough one. It's all downhill from here. Get some sleep. Yeah. Goodnight. What was that? Who is that? - Indy! - What? There's something outside! What are you talking about? Outside, do you hear that? It's probably just one of the girls trying to scare us. See? We can hear you! Where are you? I'm so scared! It's probably just Billy trying to scare us. Yeah. Come and get us, Billy! Yeah, too drunk to eat a hot dog, but not to stumble down here? Fuck, Billy, you cut it with something! What the fuck? Run, run, move! Hey. What's going on down there? Can you hear me? Are you all right? All right, in the kennel! We can't start the movie without putting the dog out! Hold on, I'm coming. Can you hear me? Stay where you are. Hello? Please. Well, this is quite the party we got going on here, huh? Although your choice of whisky is about as cheap as your cunt. I would have expected something a little fancier out of you. Some of you are celebrating the anniversary of murder. But then that would mean that you'd actually have to have put thought into it, huh? Like you cared. Well, I didn't make that mistake. Oh, ho, ho, no. I made sure every single girl who came to court that day was here. Every last one. The hard part was not knowing if you'd actually follow through with what I wrote. We can thank the gas station manager for that. I called him to tell him I was throwing you little girls a surprise party! Yup, all planned. We can all thank Ariel for this... I watched you girls play this out earlier and I think, I know we can do better. So this time I will be the director. But how do we cast? Addison gets to be man number one. The guy who wants to fuck Ariel! You two are cousins, right? So you're close. See, I have done my homework. Oh, and we need a hitman. The guy who comes home and kills man number one. Yes, you will do beautifully. Aw, she's shy. And that leaves one person out. We need somebody to film. You don't look like somebody that belongs in front of the camera anyway. You'll be perfect. Now I am going to free some of your hands. And I'm going to take the tape off of some of those mouths that have lines to say. I understand. I understand that in a good horror film screaming is essential, wouldn't you agree? Let's begin. Please, we didn't do anything! Uh uh uh uh uh! That is not in the script! Please let us go! Please! No, no, please, no! The next one goes all the way through. Anybody else got anything to say? Huh? No? No talking unless it is on the paper. All right. Here we go. You two, sit up! Okay, action! Hello... Dear. How much to do whatever I want? From the top of the making-out scene! Action! Hello, dear. How much to do whatever I want? 500 will get you the whole night. How do you want it? Hard, none of that making love bullshit. You asked for it. Keep moving with the scene, ladies. Hope it was worth it. No, no, no, come on. What, we did what you asked. The script clearly stinks. What if the two of you kissed, and then man number one, Mr. Dear, starts fingering her. All right? All right, from the top of the making out. Action. Action! All the way in, Addison! It's okay, Addie. Do it! Keep filming, little bitch! Oh, my God! Now you can say your line! All right, get up! All right ladies, this is the climax of the film. The part in which Mr. Dear sees his life flash before his eyes. All right, you ready? On the count of three. One... Two... Three! No, no! You're making this harder than it has to be! Pull the gun, if it's me you want! Oh, it is you I want, but because of you, all your friends have to go down too. Didn't think of the consequences before you did it. - Did you? - You don't have to do this! Why don't you tell them why we're all here, huh? Tell them about my son. - Tell them! - I didn't do anything! - Liar! - I'm not a liar! You wanted a divorce for the money. That's not true, you're crazy! The fuck it isn't! He was dead already! He killed, he killed himself. Oh, so he killed himself now. Why would he do it? No. You're saying my son took his own life? And why would he do a thing like that? Please, enlighten us. I wanted to... I told him I wanted a divorce because he told me, he told me something he didn't want anybody to know. He knew if I left him, I would have to tell them why. And you kept this from the courts till now? They didn't need to know. And why would you do that? Because I'm his wife! Was! Was. So please... Do tell. What did he tell you to make you want to leave? I can't. Oh, come on, we're all waiting. We're all listening! I can't. Gina here is just dying to know. I can't! He was gay! What did you say? - He, he was-- - I heard you! I kept making up excuses-- Shut up! We both started getting - sick around the same time. - Shut up! One of your test results is positive. So where we can go from here... I'm so sorry! I found out I was HIV positive. No, you're not. He didn't even know he had it until he'd given it to me. He was so ashamed. He admitted everything to me. The cheating. I forgave him, but I told him I was leaving. Goodbye. He left me a note asking to cover it up. So I did. And proceeded to one Ariel Jackson's. Yes. And you stayed there with no contact to your husband Alex Nace. I didn't want people to know. Or treat me differently because I was sick. He knew you and Jim would hate him if you found out. He knew you'd disown him. Shut up! Shut up! Shut the fuck up! Let's feed the dog. All right. No, fuck you! Get to work! No, please! Ariel, Ariel, are you okay? Yeah, are you? Yeah. Okay, okay. We need something sharp. Something sharp! Shh shh shh, okay, stay here. Your earring, try your earring. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay. Now do me, do me. Okay... Okay, shh, shh. Okay, aim towards there. Shh! Okay, okay. Good. Come on. No, please! Good, good girl, good girl. No, please! Come on, come on, be a good girl. Good, good girl. Indy! Gina! Indy! Indy, Oh, God! Are you okay, Gina? Yeah. You have to go and get help. No, I don't wanna leave you. Gina, she's coming, you need to go and get something to break the lock. You have to go. Fuck. Gina, go, go! I'll hold, you get the window! Playing hard to get, huh? Oh, no, not yet! Lost your faith, huh? Where'd all the courage go? Let's go feed the dog! Eat this! You fucking bitch! I said eat it. Fuck you! I said eat it! Eat it! Why? Because it's how the film ends. What is it? "Deer meat." Now, or she dies! Nuh uh, no hands. More. More! Good, more. Fuck, are you okay? Ariel, where are the others? She has to die! We need to find the other girls, - let's go, Ariel. - No no no, no! We have to move! No, they're all dead! Ariel, we need to move, let's go. No, no, I can't go back in there! I can't, I can't go back in the house! - I can't, I can't! - Come on, let's go. Indy, they're all dead! No, no they're not. Indy, Addison, Billy, they're all gone! They're all gone! And Gina, what about Gina? Where is Gina? I don't know, I don't know! Gina! - Gina! - No, no no, no, Indy, - Indy, no, Indy! - Gina! Indy, Indy, help, Indy, help, Indy, help! It's okay, it's okay. Come on. I got you. We're gonna get out and it's gonna be okay. Oh, no... No, no, no, no, no. Gina, no, Gina, no. Gina, no, no, no, please don't leave me! Who's there? Help, please help me! Jim. What's the matter? You said you needed help. Help is here. Sorry I'm late. I headed out as soon as Janet called me to let me know you guys actually showed up. You see, I ain't giving you girls the benefit of the doubt. I really didn't think you were stupid enough to fall for my wife's idiot trap, but... Here we are. Apparently I owe her an apology. Please, we didn't do anything. You wouldn't expect me to let Janet have all the fun, now would you? You tell me why... my son is dead... and you're still breathing! Noooo! Ahhh! ♪ Guy Keltner's Get High Plays ♪
