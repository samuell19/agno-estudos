October 1937 DAJABÓN, Border between Dominican Republic and Haiti Our Father, who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name Thy kingdom come Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. Amen. Rest in peace... Marie Thérèse. She won't know she's dead if we don't scream loudly enough. Only her body has left us. And now she's happy. She can join everybody else up there. PARSLEY I'm gonna catch it! Come. Get down. Leave this damn animal alone! She's feeding us. Why bother her? You go play. -You're with me in the kitchen. -Okay... Marie, this knife won't cut. There's another one. See? That one. That one's sharp. Hold tight or she'll escape. Let's go. Pay attention so you learn. One day it'll be your turn. It's gonna slip away. The quicker, the better. So she won't suffer as much. Oh, Sal! Now you're dirty. You can't stay like that. Go change. Give it. I've heard Trujillo will issue an order against the Haitians living on this side. He wants them all out of here. Any Negro who mispronounces the word "parsley" is screwed. I'll know more tonight. General Pío Villalona has summoned us. -You let me know. -I just told you, Frank. El Jefe himself wants Haitians out of this area. Who else would be here? We're right next door. Stop thinking with your dick. You keep falling for all these Haitians! You and I go way back, through thick and thin. Think about your sons, your house, your future! What will you do now? But you're looking at it. Finish this room, God willing, before Marie gives birth. Or do you want your nephew to be homeless? You're a grown man, you do as you like. That's why you're in the military. To fuck me over. I'm in the military to have it all and rub it in your face, nigger. Go meet with that faggot Pío Villalona. Let me know, if you want. You've always hated that my skin is lighter than yours. It eats you up inside. Say it in Spanish if you're so tough. I feel sorry for you, Germán. Done, I'm clean. Let's go pluck the chicken. Marie, you take over. Help me out. So sad your mother won't be here. Who will be your midwife now? I don't know yet. Your mother was real good. I know. How long is Marie Thérèse's spirit with us? Say it again: Marie Thérèse. -Marie Thérèse. -Much better. Nine days, Salo. Nine days, nine months... That's right. That woman could argue all night long. More stubborn than a damn mule. Crossed the border by herself for a better life. Only death could stop her. She was good at cutting off animals' heads. But Marie is not like her, is she? Marie? She has Marie Thérèse's fire. -She just hasn't shown it yet. -What are you saying, Tío? Me? Nothing, I said nothing. -How am I not strong? -I didn't say that at all. Here's money for food this week. -Tell Luis to put coffee on my tab. -Yes, Dad. -Back early tomorrow. -See you tomorrow. -Blessings, Dad. -God bless you, be safe. I have the prettiest Negress I'm in love with her Why live without her? Without her, I'm miserable I have the prettiest Negress What will you do if they take me? How would they? They can't just take you. This is not new, Frank. Sure, but things have settled now. Not how they used to be. You live with me in my house and I am Dominican. You have nothing to worry about. You're the one who doesn't need to worry. I am not Dominican. What if they deport me? What are you saying, Marie? If by any chance they do take you... I'll go with you, baby. You think you can get away from me? You're my lady. Your man will be wherever you are. Got it? You promise? What part of "This Negro loves you" don't you understand? What was that? Was that a kick? That was strong. Apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Strong like his daddy. And pretty like his mommy. That little pea growing inside you... These two pods must take good care of him. So he can grow strong and healthy and pretty like his mom. Fuck. What's happening? No, you stay in bed. Rest easy, baby. I'll go check. -What's out there? -There's a fire. -It's near Partido. -A fire? -I'm coming with you. -Stay here, I'll be right back. -What's going on? -Nothing, you go back to sleep. -Frank... -Don't worry, Marie. I have to go check on my boys. Lock the door till I'm back. Stay safe. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our... Round up all those Haitians! Have them say "parsley"! Parsley! Say "parsley"! I'm not saying it, you fucker! Demetrio... -You're coming with us. -Open up! Open up or we burn the house down! We're taking you. Let's go Marie! May God save your soul. Marie. Marie! That way! That way! They're going this way! C'mon, let's go! Keep walking. We'll stop here. -Then we cross the river. -The river? Yes. They killed your dad! And he's Dominican! What will they do to us? And Frank? Don't worry. Your brother will be back. Don't be scared. We're also on the run. We were tipped off before the guards came. -Where are you from? -We lived in Partido. You know the Gómez? Jorge, Rafaelito. They live with their mother. I don't. Come. Come here. My husband went to Partido to find his sons. He hasn't come back yet. What's going on there? Only Dominicans are left there. I had to leave. To save my family. My husband is Dominican. We hid here because of the baby. Tomorrow we are going to Haiti. Turn off that light. They will find us. I'm going to look for Frank. What about me? Stay here with Tío. He'll worry if he wakes up and doesn't see you. What about you? If we're going to cross, we have to do it together. Don't you want to see your brother? I'll be back before dawn. If not, cross the river with them. Take care of Tío. Hold on, Dad. Hang in there. Oh my God. Has my husband come back? You're pregnant. Leave now! Tell me if you saw Frank! He had no time to return. You have to cross the river. I'm not going to the river. -You can't go to Partido! -Of course I can. They are killing Haitians. Don't you get it? Mama said the family spirits will protect my child. We'll be fine. Keep fucking moving! Move along! C'mon! Keep up! Move it! Keep going! What are you looking at?! Keep moving, keep moving! Come here! Stay there. -What? -I'm looking for my husband. Who's that? He's Dominican. -What's his name? -Frank Gómez. And what's your name? He's with his kids. I just came to find him. No one left up there. No families, no nothing. I'm pregnant, sir. I don't care, grab it! Hey, stop right there! I fucking got her. Chop her ear off. Hold this. That animal killed the sargeant! Then I'm the sargeant now! Come, we're leaving. -Hurry up with the ear. -You always cut it wrong. Almost done. Look at this pretty thing. Hold onto it. How many ears you got? 17 after that little boy. How about you? Frank? -Frank? -Marie? What are you doing here? You're hurt. A little banged up but I'm okay. But... But my kids are not. My boys. Don't strain yourself. I'll stand. And you? Breathe. Breathe. -Are you okay? -We have to go, Frank. Burn it down! Watch your step. Where are we going? Salomé is waiting for us in a cave. How are they? They're good... But your dad isn't. Come with me. He was only protecting us. They're killing anyone who stands in their way. You shouldn't have come looking for me. I had to find you. Let's go to Germán's house. There are soldiers everywhere, so let's hide there. But Germán is one of them! We better go get Tío and Salomé and cross the river. Nobody will go looking for Haitians at a soldier's house! What about your sister? Trust me. I'll go find her, but I need you safe and sound in one place. Come. Watch your step. Marta? Kids, go to bed. Marta? I need your help. Germán is not here. -Marta, please... -I'm sorry Frank, but I can't. I can't let you in. Only until this is over! Let Marie stay, I'll leave! This won't end tonight, tomorrow, or the day after. -Let's go. -Please. Germán told me to come here. You know we grew up together. He didn't tell me anything! And my kids come first! Leave. I said leave! Go away. Let's go to the González house. And for what? No one wants us. They've got rooms where I can hide you. And Miguelina can help us once we get there... Salomé? It's not her. Get down. Who are you? Juan Gómez, sir. -I'm Dominican. -Why are you here? Nothing! Just checking these bodies for spare change. It's in that pocket. That money doesn't belong to you. Look who I found, Colonel. Trying to milk the situation. -I wasn't doing anything wrong. -Shut up! There are only two sides here. There's the Dominican Republic, with El Jefe. And there's Haiti. I am with El Jefe, sir. Prove it. Sir, I'm not in the military. Show your loyalty to El Jefe. It's your life... Or that little Haitian's life. You decide. -Sir, he's already tied up... -Kill him! Now the next one. Hands off! Let him fucking go! Let him go. What's the matter, coward? Kill the brat! I can't... Of course you can. He's just a child. He's a child now. But then he will grow up. And he will eat your food. -Steal your land. -Take away your job. Kill him! I told you I can't. Machete on the others. Have it look like a farmers' brawl. -Should we burn them? -No. Let them die like what they are. Dog food. Keep going! -Let's go! -Move! C'mon! Move along! Time to go. Let's go! C'mon, giddy up! Not today, baby. Not today. Move faster, damn it! C'mon! Move it, fucking Haitian! Keep going! Hey! These motherfucking Haitians! They're a plague! Go on! Fuck! You're all a plague! Who's out there? This is private property, I'm warning you! Please, I need help! Who are you? I'm on my own. Go away! Leave! Help me please! I'm Frank's wife, Mr. González. The man who works your land. Marie? I'm in labor. Come on in, girl. Easy. C'mon, relax. Sit. Tell me girl, are you hurt? Are you hurt? How do you see her? I don't know. We should wash her and check for wounds. Miguelina! -Where's Frank, Marie? -He'll be fine if he's Dominican. What happened to Frank? Don't overwhelm her, Lorenzo. Miguelina, for Christ's sake! Yes ma'am, you called? Miguelina. -Get a damp cloth. -Toussaint! Aldo! What are you looking at? It's okay, girl. Everything will be alright. You have to breathe. Her mouth is dry, she needs water. Let's see here. The baby is getting in position. Listen, sweetie. You're about to give birth. This is your house... I'll go fetch some water, ma'am. We're in danger... What's wrong with her? We're screwed... -Drink water, my girl. -Here. Slow down, take your time. Remember you're having contractions. And breathe. That's it. Just like that. There we go. Better? There there, child. I know it hurts. -Is it safe to be sitting in water? -No... It's better. And it helps a lot during the delivery. Babies should be born in the water. I have a lot of experience with that. Why is it no longer moving? It will move. Don't worry, child, it will move. -Are you a mother? -Yes. Thanks to the Lord's grace. Miguelina? Yes, my girl. How can I stop it from happening today? Nothing we can do about that. I'm scared the baby will be born tonight. Damn, sweetie. I can only imagine the horrors you've been through. But this baby has nothing to do with that. The time of birth... Neither of us gets to decide that. But we will be there with him. To make sure he's born safe and sound. That's all we can do, my girl. I'll get you a towel, you're freezing. Everything will be fine, darling. Everything will be alright. Now all we can do is wait. We can lock ourselves in but we can't ignore what's going on. C'mon André, we are not locked up. What's going on outside has nothing to do with any of us. Do we really know what's happening? Didn't you see that poor girl? -She's a rural Negro. -And us? -We're quality Negros. -Juliette, please! Stop repeating that nonsense. André, that's not nonsense at all. Your wife is right. That girl is one thing but you're different. You guys have money, lands, businesses. You are decent people who... Contribute. That's my point, honey. We are different. Oh, yeah? Then why aren't we in our own home? Trujillo wants to bleach this country! Understand that! Was it a mistake to let her in? No, she could pass as Dominican or Miguelina's daughter. Ramona, no one would believe that! She won't have to pass for anything! This is a Dominican home, they won't come here. For God's sake! I hope so, but I want to be ready for anything. For my family's sake. I would even cross the river if need be. I won't cross any damn river. I have nothing on that side! This is just El Jefe going on a whim. He talked about ordering a "cut" but for specific locations. A "cut"? By the looks of that girl, it's much worse than a "cut". You still think this is just about deporting Haitians? André, for the last time, this is a Dominican home! -Yeah? -They won't come here! Dominican, just like your gardener Frank! But tell me, where is he now? André, please! They've been so welcoming. If he's still alive, then where is he? And why did she come here? Honey, calm down! All this grief because of this damn... Ramona. That is the only way to protect our families. Loyalty to El Jefe. My girl. Don't listen to what they're saying out there. This is the best place for you now. So rest easy. Okay? Relax. I'll check on you. Let's see how we're doing. Your water hasn't broken yet. No, my girl. -I think not. -I'm sure of it. You'll know it once it happens. A string of water will run down your legs. As if you're about to pee yourself. -Just like that. -And then what do I do? What do you mean? You start walking. You have to walk it out, girl. But my feet hurt, my back, everything. Yeah, it'll take some effort. You have to help the baby get settled. That belly wasn't due for today but now you're in labor. So then... Stand up, time to walk. Stretch your legs. I'll be right back. -What's his name? -I don't know yet. It depends if it's a boy or a girl. What is your name? Toussaint. Toussaint. I like it. Would you like to feel it? -I wanna touch it too. -You can both do it. Look who's come back to life. How are you feeling? Much better. Kids, come here. Don't bother her. Enough excitement for a year. Tell Miguelina to tuck you in. She tells me delivery is anytime soon. Ma'am, please. Can you tell her to delay this birth? Any day but today. Don't think about that. It's not up to you. And you'll be safe here. Thank you so much. On behalf of my baby. Nothing to thank me for. -Do you need anything, Marie? Water? -No. -It's all good. -Okay then. Sleep well. Thank you. You sure you're alright? I'm fine but my feet and my back are killing me. Where are you from? -Corral Grande. -My God! Marie. We owe you an apology. An apology for what? Don't pretend you didn't overhear. We're not like that. André has had a rough life. It's all been so sudden, for us and our kid. You have a very sweet boy. He is very smart and curious. He wants to be a doctor. I hope he does become one. You are very pretty. And very brave. If you have a girl, she'll take after you. Thank you. Open up in the name of the law! Let us in! This is Sergeant Germán and Colonel Villalona! González! Open the door! Good evening. What is it, Colonel Villalona? Good evening. González? At your service. Look, sir. I came to take the Haitians you have in here. But everyone here is Dominican. González. Obey and nothing will happen to you or your family. Allow me, Lorenzo. Mr. Villalona. Take this as a sign of respect from me and my family. Towards your country, towards... Your Jefe. Towards you and your colleagues. -And you are? -André Bonet, I'm the owner of... Who told you this was about money? Colonel... We are willing to cooperate, please. Where's your wife? Where's the wife?! I'm here. Good. And that maid over there? She's Dominican. Call her. Miguelina. Come here! Yes, sir? Say "parsley." Parsley. Can't hear you. Parsley. -Louder! -Parsley! Dodged a bullet, nigger. Anyone else hiding in here? Parsley, parsley... Any other Haitians back there? Parsley, parsley, parsley... No Haitians in the back? You sure? -No. -Louder, can't hear you! No. Germán, search the house. I'll take these two and the kid. Colonel, please have mercy! Stay there Ramona! What are you doing here? Where's Frank? Are you deaf? Where is Frank? I loved Frank like a brother. Not more than I did. We're just following orders. You think I want this? I should just cut you up and forget about you. I'm sure you'll never forget this night no matter how hard you try. Do you think we deserve this? Germán! Heard there's a Haitian back there! Bring her! -You hear me? -Coming! I'm coming! Frank was warned. I warned him. I only want my child to be born in a safe place. They'll kill me. No. They'll kill us all. Take this to them. Load him up. Now! Load the cart. Colonel. A pregnant lady. Too heavy. You made sure she was dead? Salomé? Tío? The Trujillo regime was never held accountable for the Haitian Massacre of 1937. International pressure forced Trujillo to pay 525,000 dollars to Haiti, which never made it to the victims. No international court dealt with the "Parsley" Genocide. The number of wounded and killed was never documented.
