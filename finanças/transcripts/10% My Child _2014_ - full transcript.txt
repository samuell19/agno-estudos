Fuck! I can't believe this Oy, Niko... Will she tell him? - Of course she will! He's her father I think it's time someone told him. And if you don't, then... What am I putting her through?

A kiss on the ear. ילדה שלי 10% Yalda sheli 10% MY CHILD - a film by Uri Baron -Franny is 7 years old- No, I think they're inside. Hey! When it comes to the cones, it's better to be safe than... Sorry -You little genius. You little punk. Waiting for someone? For Jesus. "Avidar Security" Stop! Where do you think... What are you doing here? - Are you nuts? I came to pick up Franny. On Mondays my dad picks me up. Right, but her dad's abroad so her mom asked me to pick her up. Shut up! I'll do the talking. Not a word! Have you ever seen this man, Franny? Do you know him? What's in his bag? How should I know? Probably a bomb. Enough, Franny! - Terrorist! Terrorist! - Stop it! Shut up, terrorist! Stay back! Stay back! What are you doing here? Her mom asked me to pick her up. I have a camera in my bag, I'm a filmmaker, go ahead and look. Don't move. Just you wait, you stupid baby. I didn't mean for him to beat you up. Lucky me. He would have probably shot me if you asked him to. Will you tell on me? - What do you think? It's not fair. You came on my dad's day. -So what? Wait, so on other days it is ok? On her days, my mom decides. -"Hapoel and Me" - -Film trailer for the Sports Channel- "Hapoel" is my life. Since I can remember myself, I'm at the arena. Cheering, loving and living red. The film "Hapoel and Me", tells of the special bond the fans have with the team. Do you really think we are going to win? Would I be here if I didn't? Actually, I would be here no matter what Noa is one of them. Like me, she's been around forever. When she was 18, a day before a cup game, She rallied topless with friends in front of referee houses. They offered themselves under the slogan "Maccabi got cash, Hapoel got babes" It didn't work. "Maccabi" won again, and Noa was charged with Indecent Exposure and Harassment. How was school? What did you learn? It isn't Monday. Why the silent treatment? I bet you had yoga today, is that why you're so moody? Stop asking me about school. Never ever? Okay So how was your slumber party? - Fine. Don't ask about the slumber party either. Did you have a good time at Grandma's this weekend? Could you stop asking me questions? Okay. Then I'll tell you about the funny things we did this weekend. Mom had a great idea... - My mom. She's not your mom, only mine. Okay, fine. You're right, your mom, I'm sorry So your mom had a really cool idea. She said that instead of picking a place to go we should just follow every red car we see and see where we end up. What, are you mad that Mom... your mom left you at Grandma's for the weekend, or are you just cranky? - I'm not mad or cranky. Franny, you're not worried that I might take your mom away, Are you? You took her away from my dad. What? I didn't catch that. Franny, you know that with your new apartment, your mom's going to be working much harder now. I promised to help her and pick you up from school sometimes. Do you think it'll be fun if we don't talk at all? Go ahead. Why don't you go? It's okay to be nice. You should try it sometime, see how fun it is. Want to play a game? Sure. It's called the question game. The first one to ask a question loses. So how do you win? - Yay, I won! What do you like to eat? Cheetos and chocolate and to drink water. -Franny is 7 years and 3 months old- And what about real food? I don't know. How about schnitzel and fries? Every kid in the world loves schnitzel and fries. My dad makes the best schnitzels in the world. So you do like schnitzel and fries. Yes, but only when my dad makes it. So now you can tell your dad we made salad together and maybe you can also make salad with him. I don't tell him anything about you. What do you mean? - Never mind. Franny, why won't you tell him about me? Because he gets sad and upset. He can't think of my mom with someone else. I think our salad is ready. Don't you find it hard to think about what you can and can't tell your dad? Franny, open up. You shouldn't lock doors. Hey Gnocchi, what's up? That's amazing, my love. See? I told you things would work out. That's fine. I can pick her up on Wednesdays too. Anyways it'll take a few weeks for the Sports Channel to give me a green light on my film. It was fun. We made salad together. But then we started talking about Amnon, and she got upset and stormed off to her room. Yeah, she cried too. Why? He won't let her talk about me. Did you know that? So it's my fault? I shouldn't mention him either? What's that got to do with the "trial year"? So she can't talk about me for a whole year, until you and Amnon decide whether to get a divorce? What have I got to do with him? She's 7 years old. She shouldn't have to think about what she says. No, she shouldn't. Okay. Franny, open the door. Your mom's on the phone. She wants to talk to you, not me. Wanna ride the bike? Never mind, we'll walk. I want to go in a car. - We can either bike or walk. We can take Mom's car. It went to the university with Mom Your mom. - Then we'll take your car. You know I don't have one. Why not? - Because. My dad has a blue one and a yellow one with a folding ceiling... You don't have to brag about how rich your dad is. I'm not. I bet kids can't stand you 'cause you're such a show-off... I'm sorry, Franny. Come on. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it, okay? My dad doesn't even have a car. Cheapo... I barely make enough money for food. Take out 1000 shekels and buy one. Cars cost more than 1000 shekels. A car like that costs exactly 1000 shekels. What car? This one? That's not a car. It's a street couch. With honking capabilities. After you go to bed at night I come here and work really hard until really, really late. I can go to bed only after all the customers have gone to bed. It's almost morning then. But it's only temporary until I get enough money to finish my movie. It stinks, why did I have to come? I told you. I have to set things up. Your mom's on her way. Close your eyes. Mommy! - There you go. You be a fancy lady and I'll be your servant. Good evening, my fair lady. We're glad you decided to spend the evening in our pub. What can I get you? I know. Any recommendations, Mr. Bum? What's that? Mr. what? - Bum. You know what that means? Yeah, a guy like you who works at a place like this. Who told you that? Grandma. Oh, Grandma. - My grandma. She's always telling my mom, "That boyfriend of yours is a bum." And you're my mom's boyfriend, aren't you? Sure. Her bum boyfriend. I'm making you a special drink. It's called a Slandered bum. You must drink it slow or you'll turn into a bum too. Like it, bummy? - Yeah. You know your pretty mom was sitting right there when I first met her Really? I thought you met at a stinky Hapoel game. Who are you calling stinky? Watch it. I filmed her for my Hapoel movie. She sat right in this chair. I fell in love with her the moment I saw her. Is she in the movie? She will be. As soon as the channel gives me the go-ahead I can start editing, and then she'll be in the film. No, no! Don't touch that. That's not for kids. My dad lets me touch everything, even his newest computer. Where is this dad of yours? Isn't he coming back? He's in America of the Americans. He's really rich already. He sells presents. - What presents? You know, when you split a chocolate bar into two and you get 50 presents. Oh! Percent. Percentages of what? I don't know, but when he gets more pre... percents he'll be even richer. Then he'll be with me every day. Then tell Dad that he should be careful, because soon I'll be buying presents of you. I'll start with 10, then 12. In the end he'll be left with no Franny at all. You can't buy people. You're right, I'm just joking. Plus, you're really expensive and I'm broke. Hey Yoav, what's up? Meet Franny. Don't worry, she's not staying for the shift. Her mother's picking her... Don't be offended. Last week, some dwarf beat him up real bad. Now he's afraid of little people. There's your mom. Her mom's here! Come on. Who is the dufus that forgot his Arak in the toilet? What? A ladyfish with a kid. She's great, man. - Sure. 700 great girls come in here every night, but I don't raise their kids. The kid's great too. Today she's great. Tomorrow she'll want to get married, and the day after that you'll forget your movie and your dreams of a scholarship you'll have an octopus mortgage up your vein... Understand? Are you kidding? I'm crazy about her and she loves me. You follow your heart. No math. You're such a kid. You don't like it? Careful. You could fall in there. Caution Area under construction Your mom told me I shouldn't bring you here. It's full of surprises. But if you look closely, some of them are for you. What's in my fridge? Ever seen a fridge with books inside it? They're special books. They were popsicles once. Popsicles? - Yeah. Now they're books. Come on. Wow! Can I pick some? - Of course. And every time you visit, new candies will grow. Only if you remember to water them. Hey, man! I've been waiting for a week! What's up? Do we have a go? What? What do you mean? You're this movie's last chance. You said it was a formality! A done deal! But Rassabi, I've been working on this movie for five years. Fuck! Have you even read the proposition? Did you watch the materials I sent you? Don't tell me that! If this movie was about Maccabi you'd never say it wasn't interesting! You're like all the referees. A piece-of-shit Maccabi fan. Fuck, motherfucker. "Topless Hapoel fans arrested" Don't be sad. Is it because of your movie about Mom? Do you want me to help you? Can you turn stupid people into unstupid people? I can make a wish. That always helps. I have loads of ideas. I can help you make a more interesting movie. You're sweet. Let's take you back to your mom. "Hapoel" is my life. Since I can remember myself, I'm at the arena. Cheering, loving and living red. The film "Hapoel and Me", tells of the special bond... When does Mom get back? When she's done at the university. She's giving a lecture on Franny today. On me? On a different Franny. She never told you about Franny? I forgot. Franny is a very smart girl who has a lot of very smart brothers. I hate brothers. One day, that girl's author got tired of everything so he took his things and moved to the forest. Maybe I should do that. Alone, without his family? Ask your mom, she knows all about him. You know, last week I went to one of her lectures. She tells the nicest stories in the world. The students all adore her. If you and my mom got married she wouldn't give birth to me again. Of course not. You're huge. It's impossible. So what would she give birth to? Don't worry. It won't happen so soon. You know, I once had a very strange girlfriend who always talked to me about babies. She was so strange that once I came to her house and saw she'd bought a crib. And a baby really happened to her? I don't think so. We broke up immediately. Even if you married my mom, you couldn't be my dad. Franny, I can't be your dad. You already have one. Spin. You can't be my dad until my 8th birthday, either. Wanna make a deal? - To do what? Wanna make a deal? - To do what? To be best friends. Then you won't go off to the woods and never come back? No way. If I'm your best friend, then it's forever. Really? Unless Mom tells me to leave, and... She won't. - What do you mean? How do you know? Did she say something? I know, I hear you guys when I pretend to be sleeping. Okay. So we have a deal? On a simple handshake? Let's do something special. Make something up. Reach out your hand, like me. - Okay. Now pull it back. - Okay. With a sound? - Yeah. And then... - Great. Remember, this is a super secret password. Not even Mom can know about it. Sorry, your mom. - Not even Mom. Ready? Give it here. Grab a paddle. Grab it and take us to safety. Let's go. 1, 2, and... 3 watch out! Bye! - Bye! Okay? - Yeah. Where should I send it? - Over there. We're stuck here! -Franny is 7 years and 7 months old- Mommy! Here. Look at that. Judo's better. You know, it looks like dancing but they can actually win any fight. My dad's been teaching me judo. Know what? Let's finish our popsicles and have a fight. You do your dad's judo and I'll do what they're doing. See if you can beat me. Of course I can. I always beat you. Niko? Wow, Moran. Oh, sorry. How are you? - Good. You're radiant. Beautiful. So you're doing Tai Chi now? No, it's for my movie. See that Japanese woman over there? She's my star. - Cool. Are you babysitting now? No, no way. She's a friend's daughter. I'm looking after her. Moran, this is Franny. Franny, Moran. Moran is a real director. Wow, those are really cool shoes. Forget about her. Never mind that, Tell me the synopsis of what've you been up to. Can you keep a secret? - Sure. My film is going to Cannes. That's great, way to go. What about you? Did you finish your graduation film? Since you told me it was shit I left it in the editing room. Did I really say that? You did. Well, it really was beneath you. So you didn't get your degree? No, I gave up. Listen, my last editing shift is this Tuesday night. Why don't you come help me? You've got a good eye for color. Really? - Yeah, totally. We can have a drink afterwards. My treat. - Then I will definitely be there. Here, the production company gave me a new number. Don't flake out on me again. I'll be there. Bye! Bye Come on, Franny. Let's go home. Franny? What is it now? I thought we were done with these tantrums. What is it? Talk to me. Are you mad at me? Say it. You told that woman Mom is your friend. Yeah, so? You should've told her she's your girlfriend. Really? - It's wrong. Franny, it's obvious that mom is my girlfriend. You lied on purpose. You've got her number. Call her and tell her that I'm your girlfriend's daughter. - You think I'm going to call her now? Franny. Franny! Shalom! Hey, you didn't pay! Fucking Cannes, huh? For God's sake. I want to go, too. Hello, Mr. Tarantino, bonjour Monsieur Godard, I am the Israeli director from the ninja movie... Moran... Hold on. You could get into Cannes too, you know. Yeah, right. - You could. If instead of babysitting you start making movies again. Can't I do both? What did you film since you started your affair with the bourgeoisie? What do you mean? I did... You're on a track. Wife - check, daughter - check, have you adopted a dog yet? Fuck, I could make a movie about Franny. Brilliant. That's it. And make it to what festival, exactly? What is your biggest dream? A movie about a little girl? Yes. You know what? Yes. That girl is amazing. I once filmed one scene with a young girl, okay? She had me wrapped around her finger. If you do it, you have to be tough. You can't give in, all that matters is your movie, okay? Yes. -Moran, Moran, it's only a movie, okay? Don't you want to make it? Okay, let's ruin the girl's life so Monsieur Niko can go to Cannes. Listen, listen. Everyone exploits everyone, okay? Here, I'm exploiting you. You're exploiting me? - I'm... Moran. I don't think this is a good... a good idea. Danger Electricity Hey, what's up? I'm sorry, Haim. It's been a rough night. You didn't really think I forgot about you? You stink! He stinks, he's old... Oh, I forgot to brush my teeth. He stinks, he's old, soon he'll grow bald... Your mom stressed me out. She called and told me to start running. He stinks, he's old, soon he'll grow bald... I'm really sorry, Franny. - He stinks, he's old, soon... I had a really tough night. I even threw up this morning. Soon he'll grow bald... Bald? I have a full head of hair... He stinks, he's old, soon... Hey. The lost has been found... Come on, I wasn't that late. She's fine. She's even singing. Far less anxious than you are, trust me. He stinks, he's old, soon he'll grow bald He stinks, he's old, soon he'll grow bald He stinks, he's old, soon he'll grow bald Are you done? You're done, enough. I don't deserve to be yelled at like this. If you're unhappy with someone who stays up all night then I don't want to pick her up again! Goodbye. "Thank you for picking me up, Niko." I didn't feel like coming up. Why, Noa? Because I'm not your daughter's nanny. I'm sick of this. Find yourself a real nanny and leave me alone. Then don't wait for her 8th birthday. Just go back to him. I'm sure he'll be happy to pay for that too. If it's not about him then it's about me, so... Who told you that? Well? Fine, so what? So I spent a night with my ex, so what? Noa, you're overreacting. You're the most important thing in the world to me. Really, I... So what if she's there? Tonight?! You dump me over the phone and then say "let's talk tonight"? Hi, you've reached Noa, I prefer text messages"... "Ninja in Tel-Aviv A film by Moran Shapira" "Darling, I read all your precious Salinger books twice already. "I miss you so much. Come on. "What's one stupid night compared to what we have?" -Franny Vitkin- "awekadlfkjsflkji" "Are you there, Niko? Mom isn't here. Tell me if you're there." "I know you're there. Why won't you answer?" "I didn't tell Mom about Morn. Moran. "She's not mad anymore. She wants you back." "Franny and Me - "A Synopsis for a film" I really missed you, you know? You missed my mom. I missed your mom a lot. But I missed you too. Two weeks is a long time. Did you miss me? Where were you? Didn't Mom tell you? 1000 times. What did she say? - That you were in the Sinai desert. Right. But I saw you online. - So? My dad said there's no internet in the Sinai desert. Was he at your house or were you at his place? No, at mine. Did he spend the night? I was asleep then. I'll throw you away on three. One, two... Why don't we make a movie about you? Don't wanna. - Why not? I'm just a boring kid. Boring? You? I'm not boring, I'm mean. Sometimes. Even to you. To me? How? I did tell Mom about Moran. So what? And I told my dad I saw you sleeping in his bed. Franny, kids can say whatever they want. You shouldn't... - I don't wanna be a snitch! You know the best part about making movies? What? We can delete the parts we don't like. Look. We were just talking about Moran. I did tell Mom about Moran. Now I'm going to press this and delete it. Poof, it's gone. Gone? - Completely. That's the beauty of movies. We can do anything. We can invent things that didn't happen. Can we make Lassie talk? Sure. Anything we can think of. So how about it? We'll make a movie about you? But not on Mondays. - Of course not. You're with your dad, we can't make movies about you then. So when do we start? We already did. Look. See that button up there? That's the button that starts and stops our movie, but before you start you have to say "action." I want to do it! - Then say action. Action. Wait. Flip me over. You're giving me a head bleed. See that? He crossed on a red light. He's a bad man, I don't want to talk to people like that. Excuse me? We're conducting a poll on what it takes to raise a dog. Tell us the truth. Is it really that hard? Raising a dog? It's hard but it's worth it. Did you film that? - Of course. What's her name? - How do you know it's a she? Maybe it's a boy. - I know dogs. You do? Her name's Elisha. Elisha? That's not a female name. She's a girl alright. She's even a feminist. She's cute! Wait, so why'd you name her Elisha? Why? - Yes I can't say it in front of the kid. I'm not a kid, I'm a young girl. I'll be 8 soon. - I'm sorry. Come on, tell me. That's what my ex used to call his sausage. Ok... Come on, Elisha. We got a dog, we said that if it worked out, We'd get a kid. But you already have a kid. You can handle a dog. Bye, kid. Bye, Mister. Hear that? He called me mister. I'm not a mister. You are. You're 27. Do you think this will convince Mom? It convinced you. We can keep the dog at your place. In my apartment? Yeah. - No way. Please! - No, no, no. Fine, can I at least think about it? What's there to think about? You just go and adopt a dog. Did you film Elisha, too? Of course. Then when we get home we can watch it and it'll help you think. Come on. She's older, quiet. Her owner died of a sudden heart attack. She was locked with him for 3 days. It got a bit unpleasant, worms and... Okay, okay, we got it. Maybe you haven't noticed, but I have a kid here. Oh. Aren't you a little young to have a kid? Is she yours? 10% is mine. She's the daughter of my girlfriend. Oh. I get it. Cool. Here, you can take her for a walk. Great. - Have fun. -Thanks. Come on! Give me a smile! A big one! Look at me! Franny, bring her to the purple flowers. Hello! - Great. Keep going. Come here! - Great. We can barely see her. Give me your hand. - She won't do it. Bring her here. Come. Come! Sit. Sit! She looks a little sad. If we keep her, she'll forget to be sad. Won't you, Mitzi? - What did you call her? Mitzi. Lassie is a cat, so... What if she already has a name? If she does, it's making her sad. She needs a new name. So how about it, Mitzi? Looking for a new home? See? She's nodding. She loves us already. We've got to take her. - I promised Mom... Mom will let you keep her. She's sad, we can't leave her in the cage. Are we done filming? Then let's go home. Frannyka, we have to go. Mom's waiting for us. I'm staying with Mitzi. All night? All night, All winter, even when I'm 70. Goodbye. Enough with this drama. Say goodbye and let's go. You don't care about her. You only care about your movie. It's our movie. - Yeah, right. Hi, you've reached Noa, "I prefer text messages Mitzi! Give her a kiss. The movie needs to be interesting. -Franny is 7 years and 11 months old- -I wish people could fly. I don't. Can you imagine the poop that would fall on us? What's wrong? Nothing. - What? Tired already? You want to go home? Let's go. Who did you see? Don't film him. - Who? Who is that? -No one. No one in a yellow car with a folding ceiling? Let's go this way He doesn't even know me. Maybe he's following us so he can get to know me? He asked what your name was and your last name too. He said he'd find out more about you. What for? If it's good things then you can come to my birthday party at his house with the pool. What if I don't want to go to a rich man's house? My grandma said his exit made me rich, too. She's right. What's an exit? It's like... Like the exit of a movie theater? Well, that, too. But... It's like when you've got lots of presents and then you take those presents and sell them so you have lots of money. Then you can do whatever you want? Yeah, but... people usually just buy someone else's presents. Remember our handshake? I do. Do you? But we can't film it. It's top secret. -Okay. "To Franny, from Dad" Niko's here. Are you up? Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Franny... Good morning, birthday girl. You are pretending to be Lassie? That's why you won't talk? I don't want this birthday. Do you want us to call it off? But everyone's on their way to your dad's house. They've brought bathing suits. I brought you a present you're going to love. Look, I made you a book of all the things we filmed so far. There are pictures and things you said and at the very end there are blank purple pages for you to write all the things that you wish would happen. Stop it! I hate it when people open my presents. Why are you acting like this? I don't want to talk to you about it. Fine. I don't want to talk to you either. Spoiled brat. Your daughter's so annoying! I am trying to make her happy, and she pouts. She's stressed out. I used to be like that on birthdays. I'm stressed out too. So what? I'm not coming to the party Yes you are It's Franny's birthday and you're part of this family. There'll be so much tension. Maybe I shouldn't. Stop it. The moment he sees us together he'll sign the divorce papers. Divorce papers? So you've decided? It's been a year, hasn't it? Wow, baby. You don't know what this means to me. I'm going to frame it and hang it on my wall. Everyone'll know I'm messing around with a free woman. Why don't you show me how you mess around with free women? "Happy 8th Birthday, Franny!" Hey, Nitai? Niko, really. But yeah, I'm Nitai. -Amnon. Glad to finally meet you. Yeah, this is a great party. You should have seen what I did last year... Congratulations on your exit. - Thanks. Actually, I wasn't as successful in your field. What do you mean? I invested a little in film and television, But didn't make a single dime. It's not easy on me either. I can try and help you. What do you mean? Listen, it's impossible to make a movie on 3500 shekels plus tips at Yoav's bar... How do you know Yoav? - Tel Aviv is a small city. I thought your Hapoel movie had potential. It's a shame you dropped it -How do you know about it? The Sports Channel told me. If it was about "Maccabi", they would've taken it. That Rassabi... You talked to Rassabi? He's just a puppet. But you don't need them anymore. Of course I need them. We are family now, Money's not a problem for me. I can give you a loan. Even from from my parents, I don't take money This is different. Once your movie is ready I'll help you sell it, and you pay me back. Thanks, Amnon, I... I don't like accepting favors. Okay... You know, You can't support a family on tips. Noa asked me to help with the kids... Whose birthday is it today? Franny's! So Franny and I are going to jump in. We're going to close our eyes. We'll be Marco and you'll be... - Polo! One, two, three... Your Hapoel movie had potential. You can't support a family on tips. Walk ahead of me. Wait, don't move. We need to count them. -Great. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. You'll have seven kids. - Sure. Mom will have two. I threw some on her, too. What did she say about that? She said it was just right. She did? Yes. - And what did you say? I told her about your girlfriend and the crib. Way to go, Franny. You think that if Mom got a crib, I'd run away? Maybe. I might run away if she got seven cribs. But if she got one... - I don't want any cribs. Bye-bye, seven kids. Look who's here. Look who's still bartending. What'll you have? I have something to tell you. You're pregnant. - With twins. Pregnant? I'm overloaded with work. I just got a few offers. And you want my advice. If you ask me... I met this millionaire yesterday who told me about this American channel, ES something? ES... Right... - He's a co-owner. They're looking for films about sports teams. And who came to mind? Scorsese. I thought we could do your Hapoel movie together. You have lots of footage, right? Yeah, but what do you mean, "together?" Didn't you say "Hapoel Time, Garbage Time?" I believe in you, not in Hapoel. Okay. What's with you? You'll get your movie, we'll do it together, and we'll make money. I don't think so. I don't get it. - What don't you get? Last time we spent one night together you saw what happened, and now you want to work together? Forget it, I'm with Noa and I have my movie about Franny. You don't say... Listen, Moran... Go tell your millionaire that if he's interested in a movie about Hapoel, and not in you, he can call me. If he's interested in you, I have a feeling you'll figure out what to do. Tonight is our premiere, right? - Right. Everything's ready, we've sent out all the invitations. We're getting dressed up to go. Suddenly the fat projectionist from the Cinematheque calls. Hello, Niko? We have a big problem. Someone broke into the projection booth and stole your film! Oh, no! -Oh, no is right. Where's the tape? We don't know what to do, we look at the clock, the screening starts in half an hour, everyone's on the way, so who do we call? - Jesus. Call him. Hello, Jesus? Who is it? - Franny. Oh, Franny! Hello, how are you? Fine. -Yes. - Listen, Jesus. -Yes. You have to help us, our premiere is supposed to start soon. -Okay. Someone stole the tape. You have to help us find it! Jesus puts on his crown of thorns and flies all over Tel Aviv until he comes to a secluded warehouse and finds a fat, ugly man, the ugliest man in the world. Hey, wait! What about Hitchcock? Oh yeah, Hitchcock. When Jesus flies, who does he see from the corner of his eye? He sees Hitchcock! So he doesn't say anything to him and he just keeps flying He reaches the guy and says "Did you take Franny's tape"? The fat man is so surprised that he takes the tape and hands it to Jesus and says he's sorry he took it. Jesus lands in the plaza, you come out of the Cinematheque, he hands you the tape and you give him a big kiss on the cheek. Yuck, I'm not kissing him! Okay, you don't kiss him. Meanwhile I'm inside saying: Thank you, thank you... Niko, she has to get to sleep. Just a minute, darling. We'll just finish the story and she'll be fast asleep, right? Go on, go on. You went inside, gave the tape to the fat projectionist, gave me the thumbs-up, and the movie started, the light went out, and good night. And the audience loves the movie and they laugh and clap and don't stop clapping. They don't stop clapping because they're having so much fun because then you went on stage and they clapped until their hands hurt and they wanted to go to sleep, good night. Yes. Amnon who? Oh. Franny isn't here, can I give her a message? Okay, just a second, okay? What's up? What's with your Hapoel movie? Actually, I kind of gave up on it, I'm making the movie about Franny and I'm waiting for answers but they say I have a good chance. I wouldn't count on it. What do you mean? Never mind. What? Do you know something? A movie about a girl is silly, a movie about Hapoel is serious. So now you're an expert on movies. Movies, no. Money, yes. I don't know if Noa told you but I'm a partner in ESPN America. Hold on, you are Moran's millionaire? Nice going, Amnon. She's hot, isn't she? Nitai, don't be negative, this is a golden opportunity. Go on. -They're working with the Israeli Sports Channel, we can close the deal on your film. Are you serious? They pay big money, a year or two's salary at the bar. But Amnon, you know the film isn't finished yet, I haven't even started editing. - Don't be such a Hapoel loser. How long will it take to edit? A year or so, I guess. - Great. That's all it'll take. You'll spend a year in New York... A year in New York!? I have an apartment and a crew for you, they'll help you finish the film. When it's done, the Sports Channel will buy it too. Everyone will be talking about it. No, that's... that's amazing, but I... I have to talk to Noa... She won't want to live abroad again. No, leave Noa out, she won't want me doing you favors. Tell her you got a scholarship. I see. Okay, Amnon... thanks but no thanks. You'd rather be stuck in that dump serving arak for the rest of your life? Thanks, Amnon, really, but that's not my scene. - Listen, I'm emailing you a signed contract, don't be a fool, this is a golden opportunity. Sign it and send it back. They'll wait a week for an answer, not a day longer. Wow, what's this? I wonder who did it. Sit down. There we go. What have I got here? See that building over there? Look closely. "Franny and Me - A trailer for a film by Niko Eran and Franny Vitkin" Wait, pause it. - What? That's not my name, and it's not yours. Nitai sounds more serious. Nitai? No way. What about your name? Greenberg. Franny Greenberg-Vitkin. Since when? Mom is Greenberg again. Dad's still Vitkin. I belong to both of them. What about me? Don't you belong to me at all? If you want kids, have some of your own. It shouldn't be like that. We said we'd make an interesting movie. So? - I should make a movie about you. No, we're making a movie about you. Did you ever hear of an 8 year-old detector? An 8 year-old detector? No, I haven't. Maybe you're right. "We regret to inform you that your grant request "for the film 'Franny and Me' has been denied." -Amnon Vitkin- I was told the film fund's answer is on the way. Good luck... Don't be such a sourpuss, you're bringing me down. I don't know what to do. What to do? What to do? You've been drilling my brain with your Hapoel movie for 4 years. You get a chance to finish it and you pass it up? There are more important things than movies. Like what? Like if I go away and Noa doesn't wait for me, I'm dead. That's terrible news. We'll visit your grave once a year and drink a toast at the cemetery. I'm serious, Yoav. I'll make a brother for Franny and that's that. Why don't you realize that if she loves you even one quarter as much as you're crazy about her she'll wait for you, right? So what are you worried about? What if they get back together in the meantime? What do you mean? He's sending me away for a year. Who is he, Mother Teresa? No. He's trying to screw me, he's a Maccabi fan, he's nobody's fool. Screw you, schmoo you, if you had the Franny movie it'd be another story, but you don't, right? It's over. And you have a good contract here... So? - So be a shark for a change. Do you think she'll want a baby with a wimp who's always whining? Take it as it comes. I don't know, okay? I do. Take your things and get out, you're fired. What about our movie? We'll make it when I get back. What movie will you make while you're away? I don't know. Depends who I meet there. Franny, you worry too much. I won't meet another kid and I won't make a movie with them. We'll talk on Skype all the time. Do you really think I could... - You won't come back. Of course I will. I'll only be gone a year. Then everything will be back the way it was. I left the tapes with Mom. When I get back, we'll keep working on the movie, okay? It's my most important work. Besides, you're my best friend. You really think I won't come back? Franny, it's only for a year. That's all. -Amnon Vitkin, CEO- Even to you. Why? - I did tell Mom about Moran. So what? You know the best part about making movies? What? We can delete the parts we don't like. Look. We were just talking about Moran. Poof, it's gone. "Gnocchi, I didn't go. "Amnon set up the whole thing. "I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I was afraid. "Amnon made me lie..." "Hope you'll forgive me. I love you more than in Casablanca." Hi, you've reached Noa Mom, "don't pick up" is calling again. So don't pick up. "Don't call, don't email, as far as I'm concerned you're in New York." "I can understand one night with another girl, "but not you and Amnon making deals with my life. "You have no idea what we lost, and when you do it'll be too late. "Don't contact me and certainly not Franny. -Noa." Gnocchi. -It's Franny. Frannika. - You have to come here. I can't, your mom doesn't want to see me anymore. Grandma took her to the hospital. Which hospital? - I don't know. Are you kidding? It's true, I heard her tell Grandma. Are you home alone? - Yes. Get over here! All right, I'm coming. Hi, you've reached Noa, I prefer text messages but if you really love me, leave a message. Noa, Franny told me that you... What's with the hospital? I don't... Call me back! "Dr. Ron Scineman 7:00 p.m." "Pregnancy Termination" Hi, you have reached Noa... - Where are you going? I have to go pick up Mom. Wait for me. - No! Okay, come on. Quickly. Hi, you've reached Noa... Noa, this is important. Call me back. Don't do anything before we talk. Fuck. What are you doing? - Pretend you're asleep! Quiet! Cab's full! - My kid just fainted, I have to get to the hospital! - It's okay, I'll get off here. Go, go! Is Mom okay? Shh. It's okay. - Then why are you crying? I'm not. It's just the rain. Why is she in the hospital? Mom wasn't feeling well so she went to the doctor. But she's okay now. We're going to pick her up. We'll take her home and everything will be fine. Okay? - Promise? Of course. Okay? Close your eyes. Abortions? Come on. Noa Greenberg. We're looking for Noa Greenberg. Who are you? I'm her boyfriend. I really need to see her. I'm sorry. Only relatives are allowed in. I'm her daughter. I'm a relative. I need her urgently. Tell me where she is. I suggest you wait here. It's over? Yes. After the breakup Franny and I tried to stay in touch. She'd call me every once in a while and we'd take Mitzi for a walk. Then she stopped calling and when she saw me on the street she'd turn her head and pretend not to see me. -Certificate of Divorce- We never finished our film. I still have the tapes, though, so if Franny ever becomes a film director she can use them if she wants. Sometimes, when I really miss her I look at the footage of us and I realize that Franny was 100 percent my child. Because with kids, as with love, and with movies too, there's no such thing as just 10 percent. And then I think Isn't it great that at least in the movies we can change the ending and make up what we really want. Okay, film me with Mom. Cut!
