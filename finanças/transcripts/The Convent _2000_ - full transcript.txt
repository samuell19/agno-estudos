Heard you guys were trying to like, paint your little letters on the convent before the Kappa's beat you to it. - Yeah, and? - I need you to give me a ride there. - I just can't take you, Mo. They won't understand. - Whatever, Clorissa. You're always gonna be struggling to fit in. They're never gonna accept you for who you are. - They're my friends. They like me for who I am. - Seeing as how they like you so much, I'm sure you wouldn't mind if I told them about all of your tattoos, or the nose ring you used to wear. Your one night stand with Joey Ramone. - They won't believe you. - By the way, I was digging through my closet, and I came across this picture of you and I at the Misfits show. I'm sure they'd love to see that, it's a classic. Oh did you, ooh. - Look, I'm sorry we don't hang out anymore, but do you think you can just blackmail me into being your friend again? - Oh, get over yourself, Clorissa. I need a ride and that's it. - And? - And I wanna see if the place is really haunted. - Oh, I thought you gave that up with like Menudo. - What your new friends don't like Menudo?

[guys laugh] - Okay, why? - Because Frijole hasn't got any since he got booted from the house. - Yeah, after breaking the record for longest pledgehood in history. - Wait, why would you even try to scam on a dyke? You know you can't have her. - I'll turn her around man, just give me five minutes. Watch. - Right dude, you can't even turn a screw. - Dude, screw you. I'll show you wannabe's what it's like to be the mack of UCC. - Frijole, you-- - Watch and learn girl. All I need is five minutes alone with her. - Fine, you wanna go that bad, jump in, but I swear to God, if you say anything. - Don't worry, Riss, your secrets are safe with me. - Guys, this is Mo. - What's that short for? Morticia? [laughs] - Are you a bulimic bitch? - Excuse me? - So Kaitlin, how was cheerleading practice? - [Kaitlin] Oh, it was fine. They had us do the same routine like 99 times.

Crazy chick who lives in that house. - Ew, somebody lives in that house? - I guess anything's better than the loony bin. - [Clorissa] Whataya mean? - [Chad] That's Christine's house. She made'em shutdown the convent. - [Mo] Actually, she shut it down. She went crazy and blew away the nuns. Made our town famous. - Has anyone ever seen her? - No, she shoots at anyone who steps on her property. - [Biff] For real? - Yeah, man, she shoots at people all the time. - I bet you I could fuck her.

[Brant bashes against door] - Hey, hey, can you please take it easy on him? - [Frijole] Ah, sorry Riss, but coddling your little brother, ain't gonna make him a Lambda. - Oh, and body slamming him into a door will? - Just one more time, alright Clorissa? - Fine, whatever. - Please, I, ooh. [Brant bashes through door] [Biff laughs] - Good job man. - My ass is stuck. - Get out here, you fucking... Climb inside. - I think I ruptured my spleen. - Hey, don't be a pussy, pledge, climb inside. - Sounds to me like you're all a bunch of pussies. Get out of my way. - Excuse me? - I think you heard me the first time. - Why don't you stick it in your ear. [guys laugh] [ominous music plays] [crickets chirp] [Boozer whimpers ] - This must be where it all happened. - Where what happened? - The abortion. [jarring music plays] - There is no abortion, I mean, that's just urban legend, right? - Bullshit. It was the scandal that closed this place down. The last surgery ever performed here. [Christine screams] Christine O'Mally was 16 and pregnant. Not a pretty situation back then. [Christine screams] Father Ryan and Mother Superior kidnapped her in the middle of the night and brought her here and strapped her down. [Christine screams] [saw blade whirs] [Christine screams] They performed an abortion right then and there. No consent necessary. - Bet they used a wire hanger. - Ah, gross Kaitlin. - That's my girl. - Why would they do that? I mean abortion's like the biggest sin in Catholicism. - Rumor has it the child was Father Ryan's. - That's fucked up. - Did the church punish Father Ryan? - Hardly, Christine busted into mass one day and blew them away and then torched'em one by one. Nuns in flames, I'll bet it was fucking beautiful. - So she became like, some serial nun killer? - Well she claimed they were the devil's disciples. And thus began her 30 year vacation in the nuthouse. They say that Father Ryan and the nuns still haunt this building. Seeking revenge. [ominous music plays] - Sounds like you saw one too many episodes of Elvira. [jarring, booming music plays] [Frijole yells] [Kaitlin screams] - Man. - Nasty, dude. Yo, get it the fuck outta here, pledge. - But, but, but. - No, don't but me, move it now. Get it the fuck outta here, hear what I said? Move it, move it, movie it, now, now, pledge. That's right. [Kaitlin yelps] - Biff. [Biff laughs] - This place is gross. Let's just hurry and paint, and then we can go somewhere romantic. - Ooh, now you're talking, now you're talking [ominous music plays] [mumbled whispering] - Do you think devil worshipers really live here? - It's paint, knucklehead. [laughs] - Ah. - What do you say, we do a little exploring of our own? - Don't you think we should all stay together? [Kaitlin laughs] Right, what was I thinking? - Hey, start that graffiti pledge. [Boozer growls] - Holy, the dog's trying to hump me. - You said you wanted some action, dude. [laughs] - This isn't funny, he's really strong. [Brant thuds against floor] - Whoa, whoa, boy, easy boy. Yo, Brant, why don't you ah, why don't you take Boozer for a little stroll. - [Brant] Just let him go here, the place is already a shit hole. - Let me repeat myself, pledge. Why don't you take Boozer for a walk. - But, Okay. Come on, Boozer. - Looks like it's just you, me and the chronic, baby. [laughs] - [laughs] Yeah, lucky me. [Frijole laughs] [ominous music plays] - [Clorissa] I wonder if people really do come here to devil worship? - It's another fucking stupid legend. - There's probably homeless people here too. - I don't know, I wouldn't exactly call this place a shelter. - I wonder what it would be like to spend a night here? - Hmm, do you have a little hidden dark side? - Maybe. [ominous music plays] [lips smack] [jarring, high pitch music] [Clorissa screams] - What? What's the matter? - There was a nun, and she was all gross and fucked up. - Relax, you're just seeing shit. Frijole's weed was probably laced with a little something. - But I swear, I saw a nun standing right there. - Okay, you're trippin' on the weed and Morticia's story. - But it looked so real. - Relax, we're supposed to be having fun. - Well, I'm not. - Can we please just bail? I mean, this place creeps me out. - Sexy, Riss. [lighter clicks] - You think we can get up to the bell tower from here? - Yeah, I think so. What are you scared? - No. So baby, do you know karate? Cause like that ass is kickin'. [laughs] - Please tell me you're not serious. - Come on baby, it's just you're so beautiful, I'm struggling to find the right words. - So why don't you do us both a favor and quit talking. - Oh, what, you want me to be the strong, silent type? I can do that. - Wait, just relax stud. - Come on baby, you know you want it. - Get off of me. - All chicks say that. - Yeah, I'm sure they do. - Yeah, but they never mean it. - Well, I do. Look, frat boy, I'm a virgin, and I'm certainly not losing it to some player like you. I'm saving myself for Marilyn Manson. - [laughs] So you're a hater. Well, that explains it baby, but don't worry, you'll get nothing buy love from Frijole. - I thought I told you, relax. - Whoa, whoa, man. I'm sensing some aggression here. - Yeah, you are, so fucking quit it. - You talk about sending mixed signals, man. Virgin, my ass. [police sirens blare] [Officer Starkey] This is the police. You have sixty seconds to vacate the building with your - Fuck, holy - hands above your head, - shit, man. - or that's your ass. - Oh shit. - Look, I was not here. Do you hear me? - No, no, no, it's probably just the campus police. Just be cool, okay. - No, no, no, no, no, I'm already on probation, okay? Please just, just tell'em I cruised. - Whoa, whoa man, you want to lie to the five-o? - Well, come on, it'll be our little secret. Just, all you have to do is just tell them that I went home. I, uh, I could make it worth your while. - That sounds good to me, baby. You just tell me where and when. - Ah, back here, um, say an hour? - How do I know you'll show? - I don't know, you wanna a credit card? - I'll tell you what, you give me your panties, and it's all good. - M, My panties? - It's a easy choice, baby doll, panties or community college. Panties or community college. - Yeah, okay, alright, alright. Jesus Christ, what do you watch Sixteen Candles like 8,000 times, you got it on loop at your house? - What, yeah. - Bring your ass out now! - Yeah, that's what I'm talking about motherfucker, woo. [police dispatch mumbles] - Well, let me guess. You all thought you'd be the ones to finally desecrate the bell tower, didn't ya? - Is that what you thought? - No, we were just-- - Who said you could talk, white boy? - I thought this-- - Shut up. I don't wanna hear another word from you, little punk. [Boozer whimpers] - You see, every year come homecoming game, another group of kids tries to be the one to get past us. But that never happens. Does it Starkey? - Hell no. - And this year ain't gonna be no different kids, you got that? Now are you sure there's no on else left inside the building? - Is there anybody else, huh? Huh? Well there better not be, cause if I so much as catch a scent of anybody else in there, I'm gonna lock your ass up so tight, they gonna have to have a combination to visit your nuts, white boy. [Boozer whimpers] - So, if you're sure, that we're not gonna find anybody else inside. - Well there was another girl, but she bailed and went home by herself. [Boozer groans] - Why the hell would a young girl head home alone in the middle of the night? - Why, why, why, why, why? - She said something about, her dorm had a curfew. - Well, tonight is your lucky night, kids. If I see any of you little pricks around here again, you're going downtown, you got that? - What's this? What is this? What is this? - I, I don't know who's that is, man. - Oh, so now you wanna lie to me, huh white boy? Oh, no, let me kill him Ray. - No, no. - Let me kill'em. - No, Starkey, no. He's not worth it, he's not worth it. - Let me kill'em - No, no, no, Starkey, no. It's okay. - You know how it is, Ray. You know how I feel about this, the youth destroying their lives with this marijuana substance. - I know, Starkey, I know. - You delinquent, degenerate ass kids, get the hell outta here. All of ya, get out. - Do what he says. - Before I bust a cap in your ass. - For your own good. [Starkey laughs] [slap hands] - Man, they get dumber every year, don't they/ - Oh man. Don't you think we outta go in there and check it out. And make sure that those kid weren't lying to us? - Get in the car, let's move it along. - Nah, none of these kids got enough balls to stay in there man, don't worry about it. - Give me some of that. - Get along, little piggy. Nice. [jarring, high pitch music] [Mo screams] - Oh, excuse me, can I get the shredded cheese on the side? - Frijole, did you really see Mo leave? - All I know is I saw her, alright. I saw a whole lot of her. [group laughs and hollers] [Frijole laughs] - Can you not be a pig for just one minute, answer my question? - Don't be a hater, baby. It's not very flattering. - Did you see her leave or not? - Take it easy, baby, you know I like to avoid that whole cuddling afterwards bullshit. [Biff laughs] Damn girl, relax. She hid so she wouldn't have to deal with the cops. - Dude, goth chick's probably gonna go all narcoleptic and shit with the dead. - That would be necrophiliac. - Ooh. - Do you guys get that we left her alone there? - So. She wanted to stay. - So she could get raped or murdered. - Oh. - Enough with the drama, babe. - Can we please go back and get her? - Excuse me, are you smoking crack? [Biff laughs] I mean, I don't think getting arrested is gonna look good on my application to fashion school. - Chad. - Hmm. - Are you coming with me? [glass rattles] - Wait, Clorissa. [laughs] Calm down. - You units, do I have to handle absolutely everything? - Kaitlin, don't worry about it. [Frijole laughs] - [Kaitlin] Clorissa, where are you going? - I have to pee. - Well I have to pee too, but I'm not gonna go in there. Is this the ghetto? - Oh please, just don't sit down. - Fine, but I'm gonna need like a rabies shot. - [Kaitlin] So what's the deal, Clorissa? Why do you give a shit about that weird ass chick? - [Clorissa] Kaitlin, we left a girl alone in an abandoned building. Who knows what's happened? - [Kaitlin] I think you are way overreacting. - [Clorissa] No, I'm not. That place was freaky and you know it. I don't care what you guys do, I'm going back. - [Kaitlin] Fine, Riss, whatever. Let's just hurry it up, okay? Now is your little fit over with or is there more? - [Clorissa] I'm done. - [Kaitlin] Thanks. Good, because you definitely owe me one for this. - [Clorissa] Oh God. - Dude, I wouldn't mind going back for another round with that goth chick. Dude, she was so fine. - Dude, I say we charge over to that 50 kegger at the Lambda House. - Yeah, beer. - We can't go back there, bro. We can get in a lot of trouble - Dude, if something happened to her, you're name could be ruined. - Beer. - We wouldn't want Chadwick Senior to hear that his star quarterback has gone trespassing, now would we? [Brant laughs] - It's just not worth it. - Hello, are you guys listening to me? 50 kegs, man. Five-zero. - Wouldn't you feel bad if something happened to her, man? - It's not my problem, man. - You guys suck dick. - Screw you. I don't care what you guys think, nothing is worth going back for. - Yeah, well I hate to tell you this, but I left my entire stash there. - [Biff And Chad] What? [ominous music plays] - You guys don't get it, kegs. - We're risking way too much for Clorissa's little Morticia friend. - It's Monica, okay Kaitlin? Monica. - [Kaitlin] Ooh, want her address? - You guys, you guys, you guys, let's just get the stash and get out of here. - And get Mo. - Right, and get Mo. - Look you guys, maybe if we separate we'll find her faster. - Great, Shag, you go with Thelma, I'll go with Daphne. - Seriously, you guys, what the fuck?

Man, hey Brant, go get my dog, man. - Wait, I, I, don't think we should split up. - Dude, I got some business to take care of. - What are you talking about? - I got some homies meeting me here to pick up a little herb. - They're meeting you here? - Yeah, yeah, and they'll probably bring a couple of hotties with them, so maybe I could hook you up if you go get my dog. - You mean sex? - Yeah, dude. - With a girl? - Yes, here, take my keys, go get my dog, wait there. They'll come and find you, okay. Yeah, that's great. All good, it's all good. I'll be busy shrooming, motherfuckers. [trippy, atmospheric music plays] [ominous music plays] [Mo screams] - Who the fuck are you? [door slams open] - I have arrived. - Your virgin, my lord. - Ah, good. So this must be our sacrificial lamb. And such a timely arrival. - Everything's ready sir. - Very good, my minion of evil. So, girls on the left and boys on the right. And now comes the time where we worship my father Lucifer. [thunder booms] Sapphira, are you ready to give you soul to the fires of darkness? - Yes, my lord, I am there for your command. - Well then, Sapphira, you know Sapphira I don't know if I've ever told you this before, but you definitely are the embodiment of lust. - A mere extension of your greatness, Saul. Lucifer will not be disappointed. [Mo screams] - Please tell me you guys aren't serious. - Oh, we're dead serious. - You white trash losers don't actually think you're gonna accomplish anything by killing me, do you? - [laughs] Excuse me, silence infidel, or if not, I shall personally and with thy own hands, tear the tongue from your mouth, for marking the circle of biz, biz, the thirteenth coven. [Mo laughs] - The thirteenth coven? Could you be anymore gothic pretentious? - How dare you speak to the prince of evil that way, you slut. - The prince of evil? You work at fucking Dairy Queen. - Liar. - Liar, my ass you served my cousin and me a Snacker Wizard last week. - What the fuck is she talking about? - Lies, lies, lies. Silence her, now. [Mo groans] Ha, ha, now then, daughter of darkness, the time has come to silence this woman for eternity. - Dairy Queen, Saul? - Saphirra, the time is nigh for your first step into darkness. So, why don't you take the dagger of despair, and you know, plunge it into thy virginal heart. Today. - Son of evil, lord of darkness, I invoke thee master of the underworld. I imprison your virgin in darkness. We release her To the sea below seas release her against the 60 demons, possess her eyes with the demons of the eyes, possess her hands with the demons of the hands, possess her heart with the demons of the heart, we deliver thee o' lord of the plain, human corpse with [mumbles], [thunder booms] demons tear at her from every side, rise, bitch rise.

[door creaks and slams] What was that? - Huh, it was probably nothing. - No Chad, it was definitely something. - Let's just get out of here. - Hello? [scream] Mo? Is that you?

And I have an idea. - What? - Perhaps, with another virginal sacrifice we might be able to reverse the process and send the demons back. - But, don't we need a virgin? - Oh, well I think we found one. - Oh, really. [ominous music plays] - We should have set up a meeting place. - Great time to think of that Kaitlin. - Well gee, I didn't expect to be accosted by a slew of dead bugs, okay, Biff? - Can we exaggerate a little more? - Oh, you know what, I don't wanna fight, okay, it's not gonna get us anywhere. [flesh squishes] Ew. - What now? - Oh my god. [demon growls] [Kaitlin screams] [Kaitlin screams] [demon growls] [Kaitlin screams] [flesh rips from skull] - Fuck. [fast paced techno music plays] [Biff screams] - It won't budge. Help. Help. - Riss. Am I gonna be okay? - You look good. Help! Help. - Chad, Riss, they're right fucking behind me, come on move. Move it, come on. [demons growl] - Oh God, we gotta get him outta here. We gotta stop that bleeding first. [mumbles] [hand cracks through wall] [techno music plays] Biff, help me. - Jesus, fucking help her. - [Corissa] Help me. - Move, move, move. [pole cracks against door] - We gotta get my brother. - Fucking [mumbles]. - Biff, we gotta get my brother. [hand smashes through wall] - I'm not going anywhere, alright. They ate my fucking girlfriend, one of them, they're not gonna get me. - Hurry up. - I'm fucking moving. [pole crashes through wall] [Chad growls] [Clorissa screams] - Shit. [pole pops head] [Clorissa screams] [techno music plays] [demons growl] [Clorissa screams] - Please, please. [demons growl] [crickets chirp] - I found it, boss. Ew. Okay, here you go. - Let's say, listen, Dickie-Boy, I just found out from my father, Lucifer, that I won't be performing the ritual. - Oh, really? - Something to do about the lord of darkness is far past doing such crude work. So... - So who's gonna do it? Me? But boss, am I worthy? - You, yes, he told me. Your time is now, sibling of Satan. - I won't fail you my dark one. - Where am I? Hey, I can't see. - Shh, just lie still. - But what's going on? - Come now, Brantster, it's the surprise you've been waiting for. So, just lay there. - Oh yeah, yeah. - Ah-huh. [mumbles a spell in gibberish] Rise, rise, rise. - What the hell are you doing? - Nothing, it's a surprise, shh. [mumbles a spell in gibberish] Rise, rise. [mumbles a spell in gibberish] Rise, rise, rise. - No, boss, I can't. - Hey guys, um, I don't think this is for me. - No, it is for you and only you can have it. This is your chance, Dickie-Boy, prove yourself. Do it. Do it. - I'm getting tired of this, guys. Where's the hot chicks? - Dammnit, what is wrong with you? Do it or it will be you. [Brant screams] [blade thuds against floor] - Oh my God. Devil worshipers. - I'm sorry. - This is not going well. [car horn blares] - Help me officer, help me, help me. Don't be scared, don't be scared. [gun clicks] - I cast you out, demon bitch. [gun fires] [gun fires] [bullet whizzes by] [gun fires] Away with you damn creatures of the night. [ominous music plays] - Christine. [bashes door] Hello. Hello. Hello. Christine, it's the convent. People are dying. You need to help us. Please. Christine. Christine. Bitch, bitch. [door creaks open] [demons snarl] [demons growl] [ominous music plays] [demons growl] Hello? Hello? - Stay right there, kid. I've got a pump action Winchester leveled at your chest. If you don't believe me, take a step forward. - Are you her? Are you Christine? - If you came to get acquainted, you came to the wrong house. You came to talk about the convent, start yapping. - My friends are in trouble. They're stuck in there. I think some of'em maybe be dead. - Goddamnit. You kids broke in there, didn't ya? Let me guess the rest of the story. You and your friends went there to screw and smoke dope. When suddenly you awoke the forces of evil and they started killing everybody, right? - Well, kind of. - Yeah, well, save your sob story for someone who gives a rat's ass. - But don't you see, you're the only one who can help us. - Oh yeah, right. Every five years or so you stupid kids think it'd be great fun to break into the convent and see where it all happened. Then when all hell breaks loose, you come looking for the chick who started it. Well fuck that noise. I've had it. Not this time. I don't need to clean up after everybody's mess. - But you have to help me, my boyfriend, he's one of them, and my brother's still inside. - Forget about'em, they're dead. - How do you know? - I know. The demons can only inhabit recently deceased bodies. Once they take you over it's too late, you're already dead. - But my brother might still be alive. - Not unless he's a virgin. He's not a virgin, is he? - What does that have to do with anything? - Straight answer, is he a virgin? - Yeah. - Oh shit, that is just fucking great. He's a virgin, that's perfect. - So? - They fucking love virgins. Goddamn, demons, it' always something with a virgin. - What's happening? - You kids have any idea what you've done? - No, what? - Let me tell ya what really happened 40 years ago. [thunder booms] Sister Camilla was the first to see it In the garden was a little girl. [thunder booms] Just standing there in the rain. Sister Camilla thought she was another orphan. She was the first one to get it. The first one to get the demon. [Sister Camilla screams] [demon growls] It wasn't long before it spread. Sister Joan was next. [cleaver thuds against flesh] Then it was Sister Abigail. [demon growls] [water splashes] And on down the line. Sister Kay. [Sister Kay screams] [demons growl] Sister Marlene. [demon roars] Sister O'Donoghue [nun screams] Until there was none left. The place had become the devil's convent. [thunder booms] [ominous music plays] The next day at school, everyone knew something was wrong. [children mumble] I'd only been there a few weeks. I was eight months pregnant and a runaway. They took me in. From that day on, they started acting weird. Really weird. [chalk scrapes against board] [demon roars] [ruler whaps against flesh] [paddle thuds against flesh] [demon hisses] [demon gurgles] [vomit splashes] Then after all of that, nothing could have prepared me for what happened next. - Is that when they performed the abortion on you? - That's just the urban legend. It's not what really happened. - What did happen? [thunder booms] - [Christine] I was lying in my bed, my baby started coming. [ominous music plays] [demon roars] [Christine screams] [Christine screams] Stop it. No. They wheeled me into the chapel and started the process. - [Clorissa] What process? - [Christine] The process of taking my baby. - What did they do with it? - They were gonna use it for one of their fucking sacrifices. You see, the virgin's blood is powerful, but a baby's blood, way more powerful. - Why were they going to sacrifice it? - His body was gonna be the host for their new leader. The son of the devil. Unfortunately for them, I had a different plan. [gun fires] No one is gonna take my baby. [gun fires] - That's why you went in with a shot them, right? - [Christine] Right. Although small town legend [gun fires] has it that I went crazy [chamber clicks] because they made me have an abortion. - So your baby, did it live? - Yeah, he's a civil engineer in Peoria. The point of the story is if these fuckers get their hands on another virgin, they can finally complete their little ceremony. - My brother's gonna be the new Antichrist? - Afraid so. - Mom's gonna be pissed. [ominous music plays] [demons shriek] - Hello? Clorissa? Guys, is that you? That's definitely not you. [techno music plays] - Hello Brantster. Now, where were we? - We were about to jab the dagger into his heart, my lord. - Ah, yes, very good my minion of evil, except this time, let's get it right, shall we? [demons roar] Now then you keep holding his body while I recite the passage, and then, and only then must you thrust the ceremonial dagger into his vengeful heart. - Yes, dark one. - Oh my God. - Stop it. [Saul mumbles a spell of gibberish] - Rise Rise. [door crashes] - Hurry up, they're coming. [Saul mumbles a spell in gibberish] - Rise. Rise. Rise, Rise. - Now master, can I kill him? - No, not yet. [mumbles a spell in gibberish] [demon thunders through door] Now, now, now, you must kill him now. [Brant screams] [demon growls] [Saul screams] [Brant screams] [Brant Screams] - The time is now, give me the dagger. [screams] [groans] [knife pops eyeball] [military drum roll] [bullets clank] [chamber clicks] - So, what are you gonna do? - What does it look like I'm doing? - Are you going in there by yourself? - No, I'm gonna be following you. - Hey, wait, um, uh, uh, I mean, shouldn't we just call, you know, 911 or something? - Oh, you wanted my help, but you're too afraid to go in there yourself? - No, it's- - It's just nothing. We got some demons to kill. [chamber clicks] - I've never even seen one of these before. - You'll figure it out. [engine roars] Hop on. [techno music plays] [engine thunders] [demons hiss] - Where are they taking us? - Don't you get it? They're going to sacrifice us. - Sacrifice? God, why? - Because you're a virgin. - I am, well, how do they know that? How do you know that? - Oh please, you are just oozing virginity. And the demons, well the demons can probably just smell it on you. - Well then why are they taking you? You mean you're a virgin. - That's Kevin, left, right, one, okay? - Okay. [engine roars] - So what's your plan? - I'm gonna walk in and blow the shit outta them. - Ah, what do you need me to do? - Just stay outta my way. - Right. [chamber clicks] [gun fires] It's really quiet. - Yeah, well, that's never a good sign. - So, Christine, how do we kill these things? [demon shrieks] [Clorissa screams] [gun fires] [gun fires] [blood splashes] [gun fires] [demon whizzes through air] [machete scrapes sheath] [machete slices through neck] [head thumps on floor] [techno music plays] - Any questions? - Psst, hey Brant? - Yeah. - I have an idea. - What? - I think we should have sex. - Ex, excuse me? - I said, I think we should have sex. - Why? - Well, if we had sex, we wouldn't be virgins anymore. - Um, no, I think I'd rather not. - It's our only chance. - Um, well, okay first off, if we weren't virgins then they'd just kill us. - Oh. That's a good point. Hey Brant. - Yeah. - I'd still like to try. - We couldn't have sex even if we wanted to. We're both tied up. - Now see look, I almost got my hands free. - Oh my, help. Help. - Do you know where you're going? - I'm going to the chapel. Stop asking so many damn questions. - What is it? -Dammit. What? - They're right behind us. [demons roar] [gun fires] [gun fires] [machine gun fires] - Die you motherfuckers [machine gun fires] [bullets whizz by] [Clorissa screams] [machine gun fires] [demon snarls] [gun fires] [gun fires] [gun fires] [machete slices through neck] [machine gun fires] [demons roar] - [Clorissa] What are you doing? - Just shut up and shoot. [machine gun fires] [shotgun fires] [machine gun fires] [shotgun fires] [machine gun fires] [shotgun fires] [demon grunts] [machine gun fires] [shotgun fires] [machine gun fires] - Christine. [shotgun fires] [demon head pops] [Clorissa screams] [machine gun fires] [techno music plays] [door pops demon head] [blood splashes] What are we gonna do? - I got no idea, kid. - But where do you think my brother is? - Oh, I'm sure they got him over at the chapel. - Well, then let's go. [door rattles] - Look kid, we're almost out of bullets, the chapel's all the way over on the other side of the convent. - Out of bullets? - Yeah. - What are we gonna do? - I'll be right back. - What? - Hold'em off 'til I get back. [wood cracks] - Oh, okay. [hand cracks through door] - Where are you going? - Don't worry about me dude, I'm just movin' away. - Come on, Brant. Brant. Oh yes. This is perfect. - [screams No. - You don't have to be afraid. I'll be very gentle. - For the last time, no. I would like to stay a virgin in that department. - Don't make this difficult. - No. Oh God. Oh. Oh, no [demon roars] Shit, this sucks, this sucks. - Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, please start this fucking bike, or we're all gonna bite the big one. [engine roars] Jesus. - Okay, fuck. Outta bullets. Fucking crazy ass, ninja ass, psychotic fucking bitch. Okay, hi guys. Want this. Kaitlin. Shit. I know karate. [motorcycle thunders in] [machete slashes through neck] [head thuds on the floor] - Let's go. [engine roars] - See, if you had just gone along with my plan this wouldn't be happening. - That's no help to me now, is it, dude? [ominous music plays] [motorcycle booms] [Brant screams] [gun fires] [Dickie-Boy yelps] [door cracks] - Clorissa. [knife thuds against table] [shotgun fires] [shotgun fires] Clorissa, you came back for me. You're the best sister ever. - Psst. Please, help me too. [knife slashes into flesh] [Dickie-Boy screams] [Dickie-Boy gurgles] [Dickie-Boy growls ] - Godddamn it. - What's happening? Are we too late? - Not if I can help it. [Dickie-Boy growls] You and your brother get outta here. - But, don't you-- - Get outta here, goddamn it. Alright you motherfuckers. This time I'm taking you to hell myself. [lighter clicks] [dramatic music plays] [demon growls] [explosion booms] [flames hiss] [demons howl] [lightning cracks] [birds chirp] - Hey, look it's Boozer. Hey, hey you made it. [Boozer whimpers] You like me now. - Do you have the keys? - Yeah, fuck. - So you wanna go to Denny's? - No. - You sure. - Yeah. [ominous piano music plays] - That should help you sleep tonight. I can't imagine what you've been through. The whole sorority house is just sick about it. But on the bright side, looks like you'll get a 4.0 for this semester. [laughs] I'm going to let you get some rest. Sweet dreams. [cross scrapes floor] [Boozer barks] - What's up, buddy? Boozer. [Boozer growls] [Clorissa screams] Down Boozer, down.
