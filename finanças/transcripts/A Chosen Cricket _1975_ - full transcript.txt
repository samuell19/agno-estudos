[music playing] [Tucker chomping] Mm, uncredible. Well, well... inbelievable. Mm. Well, mm. Oddities of American History is right. Wow! Uncredible. Unincredible! I didn't know that. [clicks] [music playing] [boing] Harry, guess what? Guess who really wrote the Declaration of Inter-dependence? A mouse, Harry. A mouse! And Harry, who really got old Paul Revere's horse going? A cat, Harry. A cat! And Harry, do you know who actually wrote Yankee Doodle Dandy? No. Why, a cricket, Harry, Chester Cricket's great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather. ["Yankee Doodle" playing] [Tucker] Yup, Manhattan Island wasn't nearly as pretty in 1775 as it is now. Mainly trees, flowers, and stuff. No first-class garbage. No beer cans or old cheese sandwiches. No class really. As a matter of fact, it wasn't the best time in history to be a mouse. And a lot of American colonists were beginning to decide that they didn't wanna be mice neither. As an ancestor of mine, a church mouse by profession, found out while trying to take a nap one day, just when somebody name of Patrick Henry was complaining about something. [Henry] What is it that gentlemen wish? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death! -[sniffs] -[crowd cheering] You know what? He just might have something there. [dramatic music playing] [Tucker] Declaration of Inter-dependence between cats and mice. We hold these twos-- Uh, truths to be self-evident that all cats and mice are created evil-- Uh, equal. That they are endowed by mother nature with certain unavailable rights. That among these rights are wife-- -Uh, no, no. -Life, liberty, but not the pursuit of each other. Signed, Tucker Randolph Mouse, Esquire. Fantastic. It's better than the Magna Carta. Now all I need is a cat's signature and we'll have peace in our time. Wowie! Brilliant! All cats and mice are created equal. All I need is Harry's signature. [screeches] -Don't tread on me. -[tail rattles] What? Wh-- what did you say? -I said, "Don't tread on me." -[tail rattles] Hold it. Don't move. Freeze. I'll be right back. "Don't tread on me." What a great motto for a mice. Great for cats, too. Somebody's always treading on their tails. [tail rattles] Can't we take a break? My neck is killing me. I'll have tonsillitis clear to my rattles. [mumbling] Just a few more scales to go. There! The first cat and mouse flag. -Aren't you proud? -[whimsical music playing] [shudders] There's something wrong with the eyes. [sniffs] Gad, I hate a cold. [groans, sneezes] [tail rattles] -[pen scribbles] -[Jefferson] A declaration by representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled. Hmm. Now, paragraph one. Let me make this perfectly clear. [sniffs] [Jefferson] What's the matter, Harry? Don't you approve? -Oh, well. All right. -[paper crumples] [Jefferson] Well, how about -two chickens in every pot? -[pen scribbles] Two horses in every stable? -No, no, not very inspiring. -[paper crumples] [Jefferson] No. Let me think. Speak softly, but carry a big stick. -Yes? -[paper crumples] [Jefferson] No. -The yanks are coming... -[pen scribbles] -...the yanks are coming. -[purrs] [Jefferson] Fifty-four forty or fight? Obviously not. Hmm. [clears throat] I'd better get some air, Harry. I shall return. [door opens, closes] [Tucker] Psst! Psst! Harry! Over here. Harry, Harry, guess what? I have here a piece of paper that will mean peace in our time. Peace with honor. And there it is, ready for your signature. [Harry] Oh, yes, of course. "A Declaration of Inter-dependence between cats and mice. We hold these truths to be self-evident--" Wait a minute! "That all... [mumbling] ...are created equal. That they are endowed by... [mumbling] ...with certain rights." Tucker, you're a genius! I know, I know. Now, if you will just sign where indicated. [Harry] Just the thing Old Tom's been looking for. Harry, what's gotten into you? Where are you going with our Declaration of Inter-dependence? Harry! -Shh. -[footsteps approaching] [Tucker] "Shh"? What do you mean, "shh"? I demand my civil liber-- ...ties. -[door closes] -[Jefferson] And let's see now. Where was I? Hmm. What's this? Where did this come from? "A Declaration of Inter-dependence?" No, no, no, no. The term is, independence. Declaration of Independence. We hold these truths to be self-evident. That all men are created equal. Right, right! Beautiful! That they are endowed by their creator certain... [Tucker] All I can say is that in a country that's fighting for life, liberty, et cetera, et cetera, some people are very dang generous with other people's declarations. I apologize, Tucker. But you know, people never seem to get anything going without getting something down on paper first. Yeah, but I still don't think it's right to give them our flag, too. [Harry] Tucker, what's a revolution without a flag to salute? [sniffs] Oh, I still think there's something wrong with the eyes. -[inhales, sneezes] -[tail rattles] Oh, these are the times that try snakes' souls. -[sneezes] -[tail rattles] To the United States of America. United States of America. Where'd you get that name? Well, what else could you call it, for heaven's sake? I thought up some other pretty good names like, uh, Italy, France, Schleswig-Holstein, Denmark, but they'd all been taken. United States of America sounds quite appropriate to me. I wonder what old King George will do now. I don't know. But I'm afraid there's going to be some shooting around here. Like with bullets? Well, anyway, it isn't any of our fight. -We've done our share. -I understand there's going to be a cheese tax. -[boing] -A what? A cheese tax? Is there no limit to man's inhumanity to mouse? [squeak] My only regret is that between us, we only have 10 lives to give to our country. Nine for you and one for me. -Leave me to them red cats. -Redcoats. Coats, cats, as long as you're mad. [violin playing] -Who that? -Did you hear it, too? Wow, look at that. [violin playing] -[Harry and Tucker applaud] -[birds chirping] Chester C. Cricket. At your service, sirs. Harry Cat. And T. Randolph Mouse. At your service, sir. Uh, do you suppose he has something in the line of national anthems? National anthems? Hmm. Let me think. Mm-hmm. Oh, yes! Now, I remember one. Play on, McBug. ["Rule Britannia" playing] Stop the music! Are you off of your gourd? -That's their national anthem. -I'm terribly sorry. -I didn't know. -Please excuse us. You see, the American colonies are declaring their independence from England. Really? I didn't know. So if you're a patriotic cricket, why, naturally. Yes, of course. I want to help. Well, let's see. Um... something lively and patriotic. I've got it! A doodle bug from the Colony of Maine taught it to me. ["Yankee Doodle" playing] -Fantrastic. -Splendid.
