- I'll prepare it for you. - Here you go, sir. Yes, ma'am. I'll prepare it right away. - Oh, my! Dear, look at this. - I don't want it. Why did I have to come too? - What? - One moment, please. I'll have the same. But it's so boring! Would you like something to drink? I'll have another of the same. You're the only passenger who's finished every meal since we left the moon. It wasn't easy getting on the Haunzen. You're going down to Earth to wipe out Mafty Erin, right? I'm guessing you're a captain. What's your opinion of Mafty Navue Erin? What? How did you... The Haunzen is a special flight. You need connections to get on it. And most of the passengers today are Federation officials, cabinet members, and their family members, on their way to the Adelaide Conference. That's a well-tailored suit, but the smell is still on you. You need to be more like him. He's probably in the same business. I see you're not interested in other people. I suppose that's why you had to take the ring off your left hand. Why, you! My name is Gigi Andalucia. That was a rude way to address me. My apologies. I won't ask how you figured me out. Don't laugh. I know my lack of emotional restraint makes me easy to read. As for Mafty, he's a dangerous individual. He's disrupting the order of the Earth Federation government. But the public loves Mafty. They say he's Char Aznable come back to life, that he'll do what people want. That's quite extreme. According to Mafty, once they've assassinated all the Federation ministers, all of mankind will have to leave Earth for the sake of the environment. Without exception, right? Yes. All of humanity without exception. It's a childish idea, really. You shouldn't dismiss the idea just because it's childish. The world is a lot more complicated than that. That's what they all say. You have to get your hands dirty. What do you think? The wheels of society must be greased, I suppose. Everything you say is so predictable. You've had your chance. It's my turn. - Looks like a surveillance satellite. - Mafty must have destroyed it. Now we have a blind spot in the Oceaniac airspace. I wonder how the bigwigs feel about this. They don't care, or they wouldn't be convening on Earth. More than a century has passed since mankind ventured into space to ease the burden of overpopulation. It has been 12 years since Char's Rebellion. So in her mind, I'm just like all the other ministers. I guess I can't complain if Mafty kills me. Is anything the matter, sir? Not at all. I've finally realized that you're my type, Ms. Flower. Is that your go-to pick-up line? It must be hard getting older. No, not really. For instance, I no longer get nervous when talking to a beauty like you. That's enjoyable in itself. When I was a teenager, my heart would race, and I'd be in agony. This is better. I'd rather have the heart racing. You're just trying to replicate the thrill of your first love. But you know just as well as I do that reality is different. Touch√©. Are you all right? - Yes. - Put your seatbelt on! Captain Kenneth! What's going on? Wait, Captain. Minister Eyinstein! Leave us out of this. If it's Mafty, then they're here to kill you and the other cabinet ministers! Mafty? What the... A wise decision. Put the gun down on the floor, Captain Kenneth. Don't look. It's best not to make eye contact. Listen up, all you Federation cabinet ministers. I am Mafty Erin. This operation is not a purge. In exchange for your lives, we will obtain war funds from the Earth Federation government. You will be released once the transaction is complete. Of course, the same goes for you privileged people who had the misfortune of being on this flight. Calm down! See? This is why I didn't want to go to Earth! Stop it! Stop screaming. It gets on my nerves! - It's all right. - Purser! Get me the passenger manifest. Next, Sauli Stahlberg, Communications Minister, and his wife, Aila. Raise your hand so we can see it clearly. Douglas Higgins, Jupiter Development Agency Director, and his wife, Fiana. All right. What do we have here? Is the Inner Space Surveillance Minister traveling with teenage girls now? What are you looking at, woman? Show me! I think it's cute. What? A combination of Sudanese, Arabic, and Old Irish. Isn't it ridiculous? It's barely even a name! Mafty Navue Erin. What's with you? Show me the list! "Gigi Andalucia." The seat beside you is reserved too. Why? To prevent unwanted advances. What? She has a patron! - A mistress! How scandalous! - Don't start, hon. At her age? She's not even 20. - Be quiet! - Listen, you. How did you people find out about this vessel? I told you to shut up! But it's our job to investigate your organization... You've got some nerve! The Public Health Minister is dead. You there. Clean up the mess your colleague made. Someone, do it! I will. I've seen corpses of all kinds in the old wars. You're... Yes, that's me. All right. Help him. Gather some blankets. Yes, sir! No running! Have you forgotten who you're dealing with? We're Mafty Erin, and we mean business! Can you pull on that side a little? - Like this? - Yes, exactly. Ma'am, please keep your voice down. - They'll kill you! - Then kill me! Got a problem? - Do it! - Do it! They're fakes! Do it! They're fakes! Hey! That could have ended badly. What was your backup plan if you failed? I don't know. I was running before I knew it. I hope you're joking. Our priority is securing the armed group! Leave passenger safety to the second team! Davao? Why? That's even further than Hong Kong. Apparently, Mafty was taking us to Australia. But if we get off here, how do we travel from here? What... I can't stand this humidity. Those guys might not have been Mafty, just like that Gigi girl said. My subordinates are on their way. Sorry about what happened. I don't think they're Mafty. They lack the integrity. You sound like you approve of Mafty. They may be a splinter group from Oenbelli. - What's Oenbelli? - A town in northern Australia. I hear tens of thousands of dissidents have gathered there. And they're calling themselves Mafty's Forces. Captain Kenneth! Lieutenant, hold these people in a military facility. We'll claim them before the Bureau of Investigation. Yes, sir! Mafty forces in Oenbelli? Please wait in the lobby. We need your written statement and your transfer flight has to be arranged. Oh, and... I never got your name. I'm the newly-appointed commander here in Davao, Kenneth Sleg. I'm Noa. Hathaway Noa. I'll have a ginger ale. - Look, it's him! - Where's Chief Yeoksan? Hathaway Noa! May I have the honor of shaking your hand? You were a soldier when you were younger, weren't you? If we'd been taken prisoner, it would have been a terrible blow to the Federation government. Please allow me to introduce you to everyone! Wait... Now I remember. Hathaway Noa. Your father was Captain Bright Noa of the EFSF 13th Independent Unit and captain of the Ra Cailum. During Char's Rebellion, you joined the battle as a mobile suit pilot, correct? The truth is, I stole it and just flew around in it. They let it go because we won the war. Don't be modest. You have extraordinary talents. I'm Hundley Yeoksan of the Criminal Police Organization. These people from the Bureau of Investigation need to interview you, but we're in a bit of disagreement with Captain Kenneth. We'd like you to remain in Davao until tomorrow. Can you do that? As long as I can get back to Manado tomorrow. You mean Manado on Sulawesi Island? I'm training as a botanical observer on the Minahasa Peninsula. I see. Under Professor Amada Mansun? - Yes. - All right. Arrange a hotel for him. If we leave it to the military, they might keep him here overnight. Of course. We can do the interview now if you like. We're done for today. "No revival without purification," right? I believe the professor's philosophy applies to my organization as well. Don't you agree? Chief! The Criminal Police Organization? Is he Man Hunter's boss? I know the chief called it a day, but can I ask you a few questions? Sometimes our bosses are too laid back. Of course. Why did you smile? I smiled? Really? Me? How did you know those guys were Mafty imposters? Our bodies reveal who we really are. Oh, I remember now! I smiled because I realized who the real Mafty Navue Erin is, the so-called "rightful king of prophets." It's you, Hathaway Noa! You're Mafty! As you can see, I'm just an ordinary young man. You're honest. I like that. This girl can see through lies. You might not like the way I put this, but... Go ahead. What makes you think I'm Mafty? You were on the Haunzen, but you're far too young. And then I saw the way you fought... That was all I needed. Why? I guess it's true what they say. We're clueless when it comes to ourselves. - Tell me. - Isn't it obvious? When you met those people using Mafty's name, you flew off the handle. That's it? And you figured... No, never mind. I won't tell anyone else about any of this. I don't want you to dislike me. But I can talk to you about it, right? How thrilling and fun! Fun? But you can kill people with words. I'd like you to keep that in mind. That's not a figure of speech. I... I'd never want anything like that! I... Gigi Andalucia... I'm not like that. I mean it. I know. But the truth is something that must be handled slowly and carefully. Yes, of course. I've come to understand that recently. I see. It must be hard for you. Idiot! Forget everything we said here. I can't forget it. And I know you can't either. Excuse me. Ms. Gigi Andalucia, this way, please. Coming. Good grief. I don't think it's like this. You were sitting in your own seat, correct? Yes. And in Captain Kenneth Sleg's seat was a wounded cabin attendant. The Captain was sitting in an empty seat behind you. I see. Well, thank you, Mr. Noa. That's enough for today. This is your hotel card. It's yours now, so don't be shy. We'll call you at 9:00 in the morning. Please schedule for that. If you like this place, you may extend your stay at the hotel. Indefinitely? Sure. As long as you're within Davao's jurisdiction, the government will cover the charges on the card. Wow! That's impressive. But not half as impressive as you. I don't understand how you managed to win that girl over. What? Is that all your luggage? I suppose. Hop in. We're staying at the same hotel. Right. What's the matter? I'd hate to put us in danger, so I won't talk about it. So there are 43 floors? What's on the top floor? Yes, ma'am. There's a restaurant, bar, and a dance floor. Oh! Let's go dancing, Hathaway! I'll pass. Incredible. We've prepared two-bedroom suites for each of you. These rooms are amazing. This is bad. Oh, you can leave Hathaway's suitcase in this room too. What? Gigi, that's a bad idea. Why? I'll use the room they gave me. But I don't want to be alone in such a big place. Hathaway, you can use that bedroom. All right. Please. I'm glad you're in good spirits now. I'm fine. I came down to Earth to be in good spirits, after all. - Will you be living in Hong Kong? - No. I prefer the mountains of Japan. Japan? - Can you get in there? - Of course. My mother's ancestors are from there. So that's why you look like that. Enough already. The way Mafty does things isn't right. If there's another way, Mafty would like to hear it. - There is. - What is it? The establishment of a dictatorship that is never wrong. - Is that funny? - The thing is, see... If a human being can pull that off, they'd be a god, more or less. Then you'd better become a god. By the time someone like that appears, all of humanity will be gods. Are you talking about Newtypes? There's no such thing. - Didn't they teach you that in school? - Yes, ad nauseam. Exactly. I'm going to use the shower. Go ahead. I'll use the other one. I'd like to relax. I don't want to have to be on my toes because you're around. Same here. It looks like my cover is safe, but... That girl, Gigi... How should I deal with this situation? Why there, of all places? Gigi. I'd like to take a look around outside. How dare you! Look who's talking. We're not married, and I didn't agree to stay with you. And even if I had, I hate women who run about naked. Did that hit a nerve? Is she trying to seduce me? I'm going out for a walk. Gigi! Knock yourself out! So she's that kind of woman. Was I being rash? I must have been. Just like with Quess Paraya. Were you followed? I checked carefully all around me, sir. The schedule is fixed. We can't change it now. I should hand this over to Iram, right? What about Oenbelli? It's true. People who believe that Mafty's base is in Australia have been gathering there. Did Quack Salver do this? No. The general is happy about it, but we haven't had any contact with them. - How many? - About 30,000, they say. Incredible. You might even say our efforts have finally paid off. - But you say Kimberley's made a move? - Yes, yesterday. He has deployed the main force. And thanks to that, we have more freedom of movement. Yes, but their new commander looks like trouble. I know. The new commander sent for the new mobile suit, right? - New mobile suit? - Word is they're testing it. There doesn't seem to be a tracking function. I'm not sure how it works exactly, but it looks like payments made with the card are 100 percent anonymous. They say the top officials have bottomless wallets. I figured as much. That's the system created in the corridors of power. You're a diligent student, Mihessia. You could live in luxury forever with this. Don't say stuff like that in front of him! I was joking! Sorry. What are your plans, Hathaway? Tomorrow morning, you can assume I'll be under surveillance by the military and the Bureau of Investigation. Need a diversion? If possible, I'd like to keep my Hathaway Noa cover intact. And the woman with you? I don't know if she'll help my cover or turn out to be a Federation spy. What do you mean? All I can say is, she'd be dangerous as an enemy. Anyway, a diversionary attack would be a good idea. It'll be dangerous. My suite is on the 32nd floor. Aim higher, and I'll be fine. Bad news! Hunters! Remain where you are until we've checked your residence permits! Mihessia, you were forcibly deported once, right? - Yes! - This way! Someone else will pick you up. Thanks. I said to line up! - Show me your permit, quickly. - I'm getting it. Hey, you there! Wait! - Hey, you! - Come on! They're coming. This way! Did they check you too? Your residence permit? Of course. Does this happen a lot here? Ever since the Federation Forces started building up, it's been terrible. Why won't Mafty teach those Hunters a lesson? Good question. They act like they're an army! The Hunters here are bad, aren't they? It's always like this. I wonder why Mafty doesn't strike back. You're right. They should be taken out with the trash. He's too eggheaded, though. He's trying to get everyone up into space, right? That, I don't understand. The environment in Davao isn't that polluted. But there's less greenery now and people can't fish, right? There's enough for everyone on the island to eat. But Mafty's talking about a thousand years in the future. He must have a lot of time on his hands. I'm too busy making a living to think that far ahead. - Too busy? - Right? When I'm focusing on getting money to pay off some bigwig so I can get an Earth residency permit, I can't even think about the day after tomorrow! The day after tomorrow? Gigi. This is Huguest of the Bureau of Investigation. Mr. Hathaway Noa, we've arranged a car for you at 10:00 tomorrow morning. Thank you for your cooperation. Hello! What's this? A hero like you eating in a place like this? Why are you here? Isn't it obvious? You ditched me to go for a walk, so I asked him to have dinner with me. We're going now. He's a busy man, but he was kind enough to make time for me. Staying in the same suite? Not bad. Where are you going? I'm not telling. You're spending the night together, right? I've got to snatch her away before that. Go right ahead. I'm not bothered. You don't care? I have no such intentions towards her. More importantly, what about those statements? We've decided to have the cabinet ministers come to our base. In your case, after the Bureau is done with you, you can just sign the statement I'm preparing for you. I did some digging on you. During Char's Rebellion, you were just a kid, but you shot down an enemy. Yes, against military regulations. It was a headache for my father. You did it without any training, and that's a big deal. Then again, you only pulled it off because the military was disorganized. I suppose so. I'm quite exasperated by my predecessor Kimberley. Are you talking about him attacking Oenbelli? He's doing it to spite me. I was supposed to be assuming command in three days. But he's looking for some battle results before he goes back to space. You've got a lot on your hands. I'm a commoner, so I'm used to it. I wish I had a better father. Your father may end up being a weight on your shoulders. You think so? Thanks for waiting. Captain, can you help me put this on? Of course. He's too eggheaded, though. I don't mind them acting tough and taking on the big guys, but... The way Mafty does things isn't right. I know that. I know this way of doing things is... So tell me. Tell me how to destroy the depths of these mechanisms. We can't all live on Earth together. Something has to be done, or everyone who died during Char's Rebellion will never be able to rest in peace. As long as there are exceptions to the rules, people will try to cheat. No obstacles in front of our Galcezon. We'll enter the visible area in 100 seconds. Expect to be intercepted immediately. Roger that! We're talking about those Kimberley goons. They'll take 15 minutes just to get here. Word is they've got a newly appointed commander. And a new model too. Don't underestimate them, Gawman. He just got here yesterday. It won't make a difference. The fools left seven cabinet ministers sleeping like babies in Davao. We withdraw after 10 minutes, no exceptions. I hear you loud and clear, Mr. Civet. Let's go, Golf! Come on, Fencer! Listen up, Gawman. The interval is 180 seconds. Hathaway is... Has Kimberley detected us already? Do a good job, Golf and Fencer! My condolences to the souls of those who get caught in the crossfire. Forgive us. Are they here? Gigi! It's an air raid! Get up! What? Put your shoes on! This place is a target too! Why? Because those Federation bigwigs are staying here! Is it Mafty? I don't know. An air attack on an urban area is unheard of. But you're Mafty Erin! Mafty is an organization. It's not a single individual. Liar. Another minute and a half. I can't stand this. Guests first! Hathaway! Who are you? - We're guests here. - Oh. Sir. It's fine. Let's get in. This elevator isn't going to stall on us, right? If we're bombed, it will stop. Will our secret be out now? Why did you ask me? I was betting on your instincts. Well then, clear up that confusing conversation from before. They're regrouping. Fencer? Damn it! Hathaway! Now run for it, lad. I knew it. You do scary things. Did you hear that? It sounded like bombs. I think so... They got us! - We're done for! - Sir! Gigi. It's all right. It still works. - What was all that shaking? - It's a Mafty air raid! The Regent Hotel's on fire too! Cabinet ministers are staying here too! Hathaway! This way! Stay strong, sir! You're leaving me? Of course not. Let's go! Why is he running that way? Yikes! Dammit! What? A mobile suit! If that's the new model, that means we've been played by Anaheim! Damn, that new commander knows what he's doing! Come on. If you're not going to fire... Are you people insane? What is he doing? I don't like this. It feels like your weakness has been exposed. Damn it! You're getting on my nerves! Dammit! What am I doing? - Hey, up there! - Stand up! It's coming down! No way! There's a park! Over there! This way! - Gigi, are you okay? - They're coming down! I'm dealing with enemies... Many kinds! Gawman? Look up! Gigi! Over here! Gawman! Dammit! It's all her fault. Am I going to ruin it all again? Emeralda... I should just leave her and run over there! - That's all there is to it. - It's horrible... Why would they do this? I'm scared! You're right. It's a horrible thing to do... Never mind that! Run for it! Gawman... See? I told you horses would be faster. Those who tried to drive here are still stuck! - Over there. - That? Captain! He's right! Because it can't be done... Gigi! And Hathaway too! Captain, I was so afraid! Get in the cockpit. It's warm in there. Okay! See to this girl. This way. Is that it? The mobile suit from Mafty or whatever. Yes. This is my first time seeing the real thing too. That's the Penelope. The Gundam I sent ahead of me, before I took this post. A Gundam? That must be your best pilot in there. He can do better. The Penelope is capable of so much more. Looks like I overestimated Lane Aim. Lane Aim? A Gundam... Don't harm the prisoner! That's our first Mafty prisoner! We'll question you nice and slow. Look forward to it! All right! Take him away! They're a real headache. I guarantee you we'll be seeing a video statement from Mafty soon. Lane Aim! Over here! You took down one machine, but we lost three. Is that the best you can do against actual pilots? Sir! You'd better buck up, or the Penelope goes to Hathaway Noa. Hey, now! You may go. Take good care of the Penelope. Yes, sir! He's exceptional as a test pilot but useless in actual battle. He looks pretty game, though. I used to be just like him. What? I'm reminded of the time I stole a mobile suit from the military. I was full of misplaced confidence too, so I know how it feels. Cold, isn't it? Go on in. Want some? Sure. I thought she meant in another cup... So you were in the air raid? We were in the Tasaday Hotel. Boy, that must have been rough. It was really scary! Hey, you! There's more over here! - Yes, sir! - Get those vehicles over here! What do you think? Not bad for an outfit picked out of a military store. Jeez, you're difficult. Excuse me, the Captain is running late, but he would like to join you. - I see. - What shall we eat, I wonder? Someone from the Bureau of Investigation will be here at 10:00 to meet you as well. Understood. I've decided on the new name. - What are you talking about? - The name of the Kimberley Unit. The current name is lame, and I'm not obliged to keep it. That said, "Kenneth Unit" would sound massively egotistical. Well? Take a guess. I don't know. The South Pacific Unit? That would be silly! It's the Circe Unit. Good name, isn't it? It's weird. It doesn't sound tough. Circe? I've heard of that. Oh, I see! You mean that famous Circe? Circe, the enchantress who makes fierce animals obedient. Daughter of Helios, god of the sun. That's right. It's the name of a goddess. And Gigi, it would seem you have the power to make fierce men obedient. What? Isn't that goddess... Yes. You're special. Gigi, spend the night with me. Is this really the time for that? What I mean is, you're a goddess of luck. If you sleep with me, the Circe Unit will gain the powers of its namesake. Captain! Don't talk like that, it's distasteful. What do we have here? We have another contender for your affections, Gigi. Commander! Search teams up to the 4th Squadron have been dispatched! - How should we proceed? - Send them all out. All of them! All of them, sir? - Make the arrangements immediately! - Yes, sir! What are you, five? You'll never win her heart that way. You're right. But I'm equally disgusted by your lack of sincerity, Captain. Leave me out of it. You should make up your mind. And you should try to be less vulgar. Why are you so awkward around her, anyway? Did you get your heart broken real bad in the past or something? I'll get some sleep before the Bureau of Investigation gets here. Good idea. Thanks to Mafty, I won't be getting much sleep for a while. They've killed 18 cabinet ministers now. - What's wrong? - I was just thinking... Mafty's lofty ideals won't save him if he keeps up the killing. He'll have to die in the end. Exactly. And I'll be the one to take his head. I see. Thank you. That concludes our investigation. You're free to go now. Why were there so many ministers on that flight, anyway? They must have known they were entering a Mafty hotspot. - And they were in that conspicuous hotel... - I wouldn't know. I was assigned to this remote area. I don't know what goes on in space. But one thing's for certain... We'll be seeing a lot more of Mafty from here on. Eventually, no one will care whether they're the real thing or imposters. That said, they're essentially terrorists. The public won't support them forever. You can leave that. It's just junk now. You're right. Sorry about the mess, I just got transferred here. It's too bad though. I could've assigned the Penelope to you if you joined my unit. I told you. My combat feats were a fluke. They caused problems for my father. I guess having a famous father isn't all sunshine and rainbows. It wasn't that bad. Plenty of girls approached me to talk about my father. I'll be on my way, then. Will you say goodbye to Gigi? If I see her, I'll have second thoughts. Please give her my regards. I don't know where she's settling down. - You don't know? - It doesn't add up. She gave us the address for an unoccupied apartment. Did she actually keep her mouth shut? No. She might be telling Kenneth everything she knows about me right now. Mr. Noa, we'll be at the ferry terminal soon. Thanks. You can drop me off around there. In light of recent events, all passengers must undergo security screening before boarding. Passengers bound for Makassar with a stop-over at Manado, please proceed to Gate 10 for boarding. As we are still dealing with the aftermath of last night's events, all inbound ships scheduled to arrive today have been canceled. Guess I'll get an evening ticket. In this day and age, we can no longer justify mankind's existence on Earth. It is our sincere desire that you understand this. The current Earth Federation government has forgotten why we migrated to space. - What's this? - Mafty hijacked the airwaves. Bunch of assholes. They're blowing our city up! Filthy terrorists! Welcome! Step right up! Deliver this, will you? Thank you! Welcome! - Wait up! - Over here! - Hey, wait up! - Wait up! Have you heard of the Nejen? Come on! I've been paid for this! Want me to explain the view? No, I'm good. So the sea isn't really your thing, is it? That woman said so. What? Oh, right. Boy, I like an older woman! That's nice. I wish I could find one too. - The suitcase is in a coin locker. - And the key? In my jacket pocket. Hurry! Come again some time! Sure! What's all this about? I just bailed on the bizarre relationships I formed on the Haunzen. I bet none of them realized they were with Mafty himself. - No, Kenneth will figure it out. - What? He'll figure it out, even if Gigi keeps my secret. So Hathaway left without saying anything to me? He said he might have second thoughts if he saw you. Don't you think that's rude? As a man, I sympathize with him. Is that right? When things are settled here, I'll take you to Hong Kong. I've arranged a cottage for you until then. How very kind of you. Or perhaps you can't relax unless you keep me under surveillance? I did some digging. You applied for the Haunzen through Boundenwooden. Are you related to him? Of course not. So why were you on the Haunzen? Because I have a close relationship with Count Boundenwooden. Now that you have the missing piece to my puzzle, you probably regret wasting a cottage on someone like me. You're joking, right? The Count must be in his eighties. That's right. He's in good health, but he's also terribly lonely. Your apartment in Hong Kong is unoccupied. The Count bought it for me. I'm going to see it for the first time. That explains a lot. Disappointed? I'm not as pure as you think. Don't worry. I'll be gone soon. No, wait. You can stay. My instincts tell me you're a goddess of victory. That's a stretch. Soldiers who risk their lives in battle tend to be superstitious. Really? But Hathaway wanted nothing to do with me. That's because he wasn't a real soldier. And besides... Gigi, what did you just say? What? What did Hathaway tell you? Or perhaps you sensed something about him? Emme. Raymond. That Iram! A damned midair pickup! - You'd better get ready too! - What for? Sorry, but I'd like you to lend Maximilian a hand. - Hathaway! - Oh, Hathaway. Mafty! Civet. I'm sorry about Gawman. - Don't be. - We'll have to think of a rescue plan. Right. - What about the Valiant? - It should be in position by now. - And what about this midair pickup? - I talked with Mihessia. Are we being overcautious? No. It's a good idea. Yesterday and today, we received cleartext requests for backup from a group proclaiming to be "Mafty's 1st Army." From Oenbelli? The town's being attacked by more than ten of Kimberley's Gustav Karls. Dammit. Can't they see they're not helping? We only have one chance. I want to keep it from falling into Federation hands. We're walking a tightrope. That's what it's going to be from here on out. What is it? Looks like we've intercepted a signal from a nearby enemy submarine. Unit 3, Fencer, all clear! Roger that! Let's do this. Golf, all clear! Civet! 2 Galcezon launching! The submarine the signal came from hid behind Tidore Island and seems to be in the sea, west of Makian Island. We're counting on you, Civet. You have permission to shoot them down. Take them out! Leave it to us. What's the submarine saying? They're asking about the jet you arrived in. They can't get a direct line with all these Minovsky particles, but they can still get through to Davao by relaying the message to nearby vessels. I've never heard of submarines in Davao. It seems the new commander has been keeping himself busy. Yes. We can't be too careful of Kenneth Sleg. Captain Kenneth. This is it, the cruiser that entered the bay once and then withdrew. Press the Port and Harbor Bureau and the Naval Force. Have them report on any movement no matter how small! We're shorthanded here. Tell them to pull their weight! Is the Davao police chief on the line? Did we do it? - I'm not sure. - We can't tell from above? We need a little more time. Iram. We have no choice. How long are we going to be on standby here, Lieutenant Lane? How does it look? You shouldn't have any trouble, but I can't guarantee you'll make it back. What? Am I really doing this? Never mind, don't answer that. We don't have any spare pilots available for this. Emme, pick up the pace! Get that data into the Messer, quick. I know already! This operation is beyond insane, Hathaway. I'm sorry, Raymond. It's all right. I'll make sure I get you there. I'm counting on you. This is an operation we can't let you take part in, Raymond. Well, she's the one I feel sorry for. The owner of the cruiser is a Side 3 parliament official. At present, he's on a ship headed to Hong Kong for the Adelaide Conference. Message from the Naval Force! Unidentified forces detected over the center and west coast of Halmahera Island! I keep telling you. If I knew everything, that would be dangerous. I really don't know anything. Mr. Gawman Nobile. - Yes? - I just remembered something. You were looking at Hathaway Noa. He's famous. He's the son of Bright Noa. Hathaway is involved with Mafty. Am I right? Yes, he's Mafty. He plays the role of Mafty Erin himself. The "role of Mafty Erin"? Then someone must be pulling his strings. Who is it? If you don't want to talk, I'm happy to set you up as Mafty and send you to the gallows. I really don't know. I've heard the rumors though. They're saying Mafty's the ghost of Char Aznable. Fine then. If you won't talk, that makes it all the more fun for me. A mobile suit? It's the Penelope. I'm Lieutenant Lane Aim. Captain Kenneth said to use you as a hostage. He wants me to use you as a shield if things go south. - You bastards! That's low! - I have to disagree. Unlike Mafty's indiscriminate terrorist attacks, only one life will be lost... yours. But that's not my style. I guarantee your safety as long as I can fight in the Penelope. - There's still room for more! - Man, that thing was an antique! All right, take it away! Hurry up! What the hell's going on? Apparently, three Kessarias and that new model have taken off from Davao. They're headed this way! But we sank that run-down submarine! What's going on, Iram? We'll ditch this base and join the Valiant and Seawrack. Are you serious? Matching azimuth angle to that of Cargo Pisa, which is ready for descent. Wait. Database variables are feasible. Disengaging booster bed. Three, two, one. Will we catch it? Don't know. No one's ever done anything this crazy. How are you doing, Emme? Just make sure you don't mess up, Raymond. That hurt. Cargo detected! It's behind us, to the right! Thirty degrees! Yes, I can see it. - Purging shields! - Activating visual display. Emeralda, do a final sweep for nearby enemies. Roger. Above us, on the left! What's that? - The one from before? - I think so. Raymond, enemy incoming! Go for it, Emme! There are no second chances now! I'm fine with a little damage. Ram into it! My thoughts exactly! Here it comes. Don't leave it all up to the machine! I'm doing it! Well done, Emeralda. Sorry. My naivete led to this situation. When it was time to return from Anaheim, I boarded the Haunzen with my privileges as Hathaway Noa because I couldn't resist the temptation of seeing the cabinet ministers one last time before I killed them. That was a mistake, and now my comrades are in danger. Isn't that right, Quess? If that's your answer, I'll change. I will change... into Mafty Navue Erin! Well done making it here on your own, Xi G. Flying objects launched 150km off the west coast of Halmahera. - Where's the Lane team? - They're 200km north of Halmahera. It's unlikely we can contact them. We have no choice but to trust Lane's judgment. Keep transmitting to the Lane team! It's him. I've seen what he's capable of. And if I'm right... Mafty Navue Erin! Is Mafty behind that too? Lane team, intercept descending object. I'll cut them off. These confusing relationships and Gigi Andalucia too! Damn gravity! I'm hit! The grim reaper won't come when you're ready for him, Hathaway. Mind your own business! I'm losing my touch! Is it because of Gigi? The ocean! If I don't get out now, the Valiant will be in trouble too! This has to work out somehow! What? It dodged! But how? Even Mafty can get hold of a Gundam. A Gundam? With a Minovsky flight system? Don't follow! They'll target us! Don't insult me! I can handle this! Take a good look! He's coming from the side this time! On your right! - Now climb! - I know! I lost my footing! Landing on the small island, port side! What's next? Lane! - So Mafty brought out a Gundam copy. - Get back, or he'll get us! - Shut up! - Gawman? Gawman! Have you betrayed us? Or are they using you as a shield? Answer me! A shield, you say? Don't insult me! I'm not like Commander Kenneth! Forget about me! Destroy this new model! Please! Penelope pilot! Lane Aim! So you can't fight unless you have a hostage? You're pathetic! You know my name? You can have him back! I was just following the Captain's orders! Is this a trap? Should I believe him? Lane Aim... An honorable man. Gawman! It's all hell from here on out! So it would seem. I didn't wait for you out of mercy, you imitation Gundam! I want to settle this in one move. Can I do it? You show him, Mafty! Here he comes. That fool! He's fast! You're not getting away! I'm alive. What's going on? I saw him go down! But I finished him off. How is this possible? Is Lane safe and sound? Considering the damage to his machine, it's a miracle he made it back alive. See? You're a goddess of luck. Am I? I don't feel it myself. The fact that you've survived on your own is proof of your good fortune. I have my own plans, though. I feel bad for the Count. You mean Hong Kong? That's life for you. A never-ending string of obligations. Yes, I suppose you could call it that. Life can be such a nuisance. I'm not that obsessed with living. Not me. - Hey! - You did great, Hathaway! Julia, equipment repairs are the priority! Jeez! Beam rifle's gone. He used it as a decoy to draw the Penelope's fire. Like how? I launched it, then sent it flying. It fired the wrong way, and I almost got hit myself. If you hadn't made that hit-and-run attack, I'd be dead. Right, Hathaway? Stay still! Man, that must have been insane! Dammit. The spare parts are probably at the bottom of the ocean. Forget about it! The leader's machine gets targeted first. It's mine. I got it from Hathaway. If you're in good shape, we'll go scout out Oenbelli right away. Got it? You heard her. Of course. The ship captain's already on it. Maximilian will have to work his magic. But Maximilian has a problem. We only recovered half the spare parts for the Xi, and the rest sank. Kelia? I wasn't expecting you so soon. Well, getting here from Hong Kong is a lot easier than returning from space. Hathaway's father is still in the military, right? Children don't always take after their parents. That's a good point. I think I'll test my luck and see if I'm as lucky as you say. - I'll be here for two or three days. - That's a good idea. That may just make things interesting. I don't know about that.
