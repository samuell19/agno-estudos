Wandering procession, lost in a mirage, on the route of the slave caravans: Mandingue, Arada, Bambara, Iba, Ashanti, Fanti, Yorouba... Moaning a song choked by iron collars. I am not a slave. I am as free as my heart. ADANGGAMAN Africa, Late 17th Century Not here! I want you! Please... Not here! We'll get caught. I love you. We'll get caught. I must do my fishing. But I want you... I want you so badly. A father has no right to run his son's life! A son must obey and respect his father! How can a boy dare to contradict the decisions of his father? What is this world coming to? Ossei and his father are fighting! Why? Ossei refuses to marry Adjo! As long as I, your father N'Go, am alive, Adjb will be your wife, and no other! Marry that goddess yourself, if you find her so worthy! Hush, son. That s no way to speak to your father. I'm old enough to use my own free will. Free? You? Dirty little scoundrel! You dare to insult me? Watch out! Stop arguing. It breaks my heart. I'm sorry it upsets you. But no one in the world can make me marry a girl I do not love. Not today, not tomorrow, you will not marry that slave girl. Enough of your tyranny! I'm telling you that I'm free to choose the woman I want. The bad blood of that slave will not tarnish our noble blood. Enough of your tiresome stories of noble blood and slaves! So you make the decisions now? The world is changing, N'Go! You must change, too! Raise your son before trying to change the world! It is decided. This marriage must be. You have no choice. Take this woman to avoid shame and dishonor. Let's hope he obeys. The night will tell. Ancient law must be respected. Spirits protect us! Peace be with us. Magic fish... Magic fish, the moon allows you to breathe out of water. Do you want to return to the dark waters to find your loved ones? You will be happy once again. Ossei is just a boy. He is nothing compared to me. I'll show him. Try to think calmly. Ossei is our only son. Shut up! It's all your fault. You raised him that way. So now you're blaming me? I did my share. I worried more than enough. I cannot sleep with his wife for him, too! If only that could calm you... But tell me, with all the women you've had in your time... No one forced them on you! Stop your rambling, woman! My authority is at stake. And I swear on your life that I will discipline him. I must meet that Adjo. That unforgettable Adjo... That princess of the night... That magnificent bride. She annoys me. And me? I don't want her. It's my father. I love only you. As long as I am in your arms, I will be free. Discipline is achieved with the force of a big stick. Let us be showered with peace. Ossei! All here belongs to Adanggaman! He who cannot serve his empire must die! Mo Akassi, where are you? It's Ossei. your son! Mo Akassi! Mo Akassi, where are you? And you, my beloved? Where are you? It's me, Ossei! Where's my mother? Where's my mother and my girlfriend? Why did you abandon them? They were so upset... See what has happened! Now all is ash and ruins. What about your noble blood now? Peace be with your soul. The dead are sometimes more alive than the living themselves. Where are you? Mother! Mo Akassi, where are you? Move along! Hurry! Lazy dogs! Stinking beasts! Go on! Move it! This way! Hurry! Go back with the others! Stinking beasts! Move it! You'll be beaten for this! You dirty dogs! Stay with the others! How did you find me? Don't move or they'll kill us. You need food. They killed your father. I know. Be careful... Those women are bloodthirsty and unstoppable. Oh, my god! Get the old woman! I'll take care of him! I'll get you! You can't go anywhere! You can't escape me! I'll kill you! I've got you now! Finish it then! Kill me! No one can ignore the interests of the royal council. That each one of you report to me precisely, honestly... and rigorously from his respective territory. Adagba, chief of the Province of 21 Oxbow Lakes... Speak up! Now! At your service... King Adanggaman, emperor of emperors. I bring 100 bushels of corn, 100 of rice. 50 of sorghum, 1000 heads of cattle, 550 heads of sheep, not to mention the chickens. Excellent! A fine and loyal servant! The empire salutes you. Tchakoto! Your turn! Most High Emperor, I have collected 200 brown canaries and 75 yellow ones. The security of our borders is absolute due to a recent victory. The Turtle Eaters have been annihilated. No one was spared. No man, no woman, no child. What? No women, no men? Then how will we populate and enrich the kingdom? Tell me how? How will we build up the kingdom? Tchakoto! Do you ignore that warfare procedure and military strategy are exclusively reserved for the King? Only Adanggaman captures slaves, sells them and buys them. Only I have that power! Me alone! Is that clear? You will never behave this way again. Never again! You are dismissed! Is that understood? Put him in chains! You've been marked by the amazons. Those killers! That wound needs attention. An amazon's dagger can be deadly. Open your mouth! Open your stinking mouth! What's your name? Leave him. I know how to tame wild things. Adanggaman, sir. That's the unruly Kanga. - Him? - Yes. Take him away. Put him with those chosen for the next shipment. You! What's your name? Slaves have no names. Since you belong to me, I shall give you a name. You are now Botimo. You know what that means? It's a female monkey, insatiable and wanting. Does it please you? Me, Botimo? Adanggaman! Me, insatiable? You are insatiable! Insatiable for gold! Insatiable for injustice! Insatiable for slaves! You are Botimo! Who are you to suppress the lives and freedom of others? Pretending you have the power over life and death by selling human lives! You are the monkey Botimo. You monkey around with the Whites for rum and guns... You are Botimo. You sell your own flesh and blood. You are selling your soul. Botimo is you. Take this cursed witch away! Take her away! Fear not. I must stop the gangrene from eating the flesh. Adanggaman must be happy with that bountiful hunt! It brought him much. What does he do with the prisoners? He sells the strongest for the dreaded voyage across the Ocean. The weaker who would never survive are sold to rich locals. Who are they? Whites from the other side of the Ocean. Some say life is better as their slave. Children under six and the sick are just killed. You must have someone very dear among those poor souls. My mother. And your father? He was killed. Here, drink. This potion is an ancient secret of the royal healers. It tastes like antelope blood. Who are you? I come from the land of the Panther People. I'm a hunter. But I swear on my mother that I was powerless alone against those amazon warriors. I defended myself but they are so bloodthirsty and strong! It's not your fault. No one could beat them. Your scar will be proof of your boldness. What does that strange bird on your arm represent? Rest. You need it. Father! Father! No! I am not a slave. I am free! No one is my master. My heart is free. My mind is free. I am free! As long as my mother is in the hands of that tyrant, my heart will never be at peace. I want to take her place as prisoner so that she can hold on to the little dignity she has left. My son, the great civilizations knew how to predict the future. That's why the oracle is so important. This serious dilemma means we must look to the memory of the past. Things look harsh. When a storm uproots an iroko. the ferns take over. What do your shells say? Very bad signs. The death traders will get richer. The whip will reign for a long time. When the tire awakens from the ashes. it will warm us no more. My house is a tomb. My village is a cemetery. Death lurks around us. Death? What death? The death with the wicked smile. We will suffer a humiliation which no other people has known. Despair weaves an immense web around our lives. It will wrap us like a shroud. Here we are again thrown into the depths of horror. Stay. Who sent me this revolting rum? Is that what the white kings drink? That explains their paleness. Tell that rogue that I have proposals from the Dutch. Do you understand? I will send to his king, my friend and colleague. Is that clear? Give me some anyway. Send in that arrogant mule and that tired old fool. So you're the rebellious cock who wants to become prisoner in place of his mother? Did you consider the risks that your audacity now puts you in? Look around you. This world belongs to me. If you have not realized, mine is the only voice. Everything alive sprouts. grows and breathes in the shadow of my protection. Shameless old man! At your wise and reasonable age, you travel at risk with this silly youth who wants to make trouble and revolution in my kingdom. My kingdom of peace, justice and happiness! It was never our intention to create trouble or incite revolution. Shut up, old fool! I have come to offer my freedom in exchange for that of my mother. Who said you were free? You cannot bargain with a freedom you do not have. I am here of my own will. I follow our traditions which permit any man to offer his life in place of a loved one unjustly treated. Your ignorance is very persistent. I am the law here! Traditions are made by me! Your Majesty, reconsider your decision. Observe the courage of this young man. For the well-being and freedom of his mother, he braved hunger, thirst, wild beasts, sickness and death. With all these virtues. I have only to give up my throne to him! I've heard enough... Send in that old harpy! My god! My daughter! My daughter, that bird is the emblem of our people... the Sankofa. Listen to its cry... That means: all must come to an end. Naka, you are my only daughter. After the death of your mother, you are all that's left that I cherish in this world! Adanggaman! It's me who you want, free my son. I am insatiable for blood and power. You said I was insatiable for slaves! And I said: you belong to me. At present, your son is also part of the goods that excite my whims. Old Botimo, the insatiable witch! Your threats, your blackmail. and your perverse acts cannot intimidate me! We will see about that! That rum gave me no pleasure at all. I will give you what you want the most: a big and fat one. Since you like it so much! It takes a madman to punish a madwoman! Don't move, water! Give in to me! Let me do it to you, water! Stop making love to the water! There are better ways. Wait up! I'm coming! Bring in that young man. Put him with those for the Dutch, and sell the old fool to a local. Put them in chains! Naka! You're my only daughter! Some will never get over the shock. What a curse! Sometimes they cross loved ones on this sad path. Others, like myself, search in vain the lost happiness of our tormented lives. It's not your fault. My daughter, Naka, started off differently. She was taken away 15 years ago by the slave hunters. She was only 7 years old. Look at what she has become: a violent amazon. Strange destinies, ours. If not for your healing talents, I would have died from Naka s stab. Then we meet at this odd crossroads. My mother imprisoned, you, a prisoner, Naka taken and trained to kill, and me, your friend, a slave. You see, freedom. the hell of chains... slavery... Sorry! Don't give up. You have to fight. Help! Help me! Adanggaman! What are you doing to my mother? Adanggaman! You're at my mercy! You monkey around with the Whites for rum and guns. You are Botimo. You sell your own flesh and blood. You are selling your soul. Botimo is you. Mine is the only voice. Everything alive sprouts, grows and breathes in the shadow of my protection. Get up! Get up! Your attention, please! Here are some specimens from Adanggaman's stable. They are well-fed, strong, healthy and above all, well-trained and tamed. Dance! Dance! Dance in step! As I already said, this man is as strong as an ox. In addition to his physical prowess, he's an excellent field hand. good with a machete. Starting price: one sheep. Bidding is now open. Who'll start? One cow! A cow and a sheep! A cow, a sheep and a goat! Anyone else? Going once... going twice... Two cows, two sheep, two goats and a basket of yams! Sold! What do you want from me? I have enough of you and your kind! Your violence, your chains and your shackles! Not a move or I'll put this right through your heart! Think about it. I would have already killed you, if I had wanted to. Here... Can't we put the past behind us? We have escaped two horrors: slavery and death. Destroying each other would only please our enemies. Let's try to appreciate our freedom and maybe find happiness. I was an amazon warrior and you, a prisoner. It's true, I pursued your people. But I wouldn't be here if a cry of revolt had not shot out of me. Enough! You and your killers took from me that which was most precious. I have only my freedom left. No one can take that! I ask nothing of you. It's my turn to give you everything. I am at your mercy now. Kill me if you want. I must find the house of my father, the land in which my mother rests. Only then can I return to who I am. The real Naka waits for me there. For the moment, she is but a shadow. The shadow of a frightened little girl behind a door. But that shadow, Naka... It's you! Not yet. I don't even know the way to the house anymore. I know where it is. I will guide you. Be careful! Let me go! Is that you? You will live! - Move it! - Hurry! Go on! Move it! You are a slave and always will be! On April 13, 1685 Adanggaman, drunk with rum, was captured and sold by one of his aides. He became a cook in St. Louis under the name of Walter Brown. Stricken with tubercutosis, he died on November 21, 1698, without a penny to his name. Ossei was sold to a rich plantation owner and became John Stanford. While in captivity, he married a young slave who bore him five children. He died at the age of 70, never having regained his status as a free man. To all the Africans who suffered the iron collars and chains of slavery. And to the children and grandchildren who bear their scars. English Adaptation: Richard Lormand Hardsubs transcript by pami
