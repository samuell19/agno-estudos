- September 16th, approximately 12:05. Video log of Abe Bond. After many months, I've finally broken through the forbidden wall. I stand at death's door. My chosen subjects, too, at this time have shown an amazing aggression, something that I never imagined. With this final act, I join my legion. The world that is known dies tonight. - Okay. October 31st, 9:45 p.m. Happy Halloween. Autopsy of male Caucasian, age approximately 24. Time of death approximately 11:08 p.m. Cause of death unknown. Dr. Sarah Ross slicing and dicing. Let's see what we have here. Subject has suffered serious exterior trauma. Several sizable wounds starting at the torso continuing down to the abdominals. First glance my guess to cause of wounds to be power tool. Possibly a chainsaw. Very nice. Several more wounds at the tricep neck regions. Not as large as torso wounds, but deeper. Wounds unlike others. Flesh appears to have been torn out, not cut. Closer inspection reveals what appears to be a human tooth. Whoever did this hasn't heard too much red meat'll kill him. He's sure in for a surprise. Facial and cranial areas have suffered the most damage, that's for sure. Why is it the hunky guys are always dead before I get to meet 'em? Guess I have to get outta here more often. Clearly exterior trauma is most probable cause of death, however, interior examination is necessary to clear up any-- What the fuck? Okay, there was just a mangled cute guy here a minute ago and now he's gone. It's Halloween. Obviously you're either working too hard or someone has really gone out of their way to play a joke on you. Shit. Okay, time to get the fuck outta here and find a new career. ♪ You're right above me ♪ Until it's low ♪ The deeper you take me ♪ The further I go ♪ My accent has faded ♪ It's given a real ♪ I gotta remember ♪ The things I won't feel ♪ When I'm dead ♪ And gone when I'm dead ♪ And gone from you ♪ When I'm dead ♪ And gone when I'm dead ♪ And gone from you - Cut. That was great, you guys. Real horror show. - Thanks. Can someone please get me my robe? - You too, Shell. Really, really killer stuff. - Yeah, your stuff is disgusting David. Paul! - Yeah? Yeah, yeah, what do you need? - Can I have some water so I can rinse this shit out of my mouth? - Well see, it's corn syrup, so-- Yeah, I got it. - Why do you do that? You know he likes you and you always torture him. - What did I say? - You called his blood shit. You know how he takes pride in that techie crap. - Look, you deal with him and my brother for as many years as I have and you take your shots where you can. Besides, he's your best friend, not mine. - Hey, hey, hey watch it. No fair giving the other actors here any inside info on the director, okay? - Eric, any time you wanna know what kind of hell you got yourself into, you can ask me. - Hey. I just had to direct my sister here in a less-than-fully-clothed scene. Now that, my friend, is hella weird. - Yeah well, if you weren't such a sick and twisted pervert you wouldn't write such smut for your sister, someone you hardly know to be in. - That's true. What the hell is going on here? Oh, shit. - Who's that? Our sister. You never told me you had two sisters. Hmm. - That was sorta the idea. Nina, you made it. - Why the hell is Shelly doing my part? - Well, you're two hours late. I had to do something. - Well I'm here now. Shoot the scene over. - What? - Look Shell, you and I both know I'm the better actress. - Look Nina, you and I both know the only way you've ever gotten anything your entire life has been by badgering someone into it. - That is so not true. David, tell her. - All right, enough, okay? I've got enough to deal with here to have you two fighting. - Well, what are you gonna do about it, David? - Shell, will you give me a minute with Nina here, please? Please? - All right. - I'll take that. You won't be needing it. - Hey listen, man. I can take off too, if it's gonna become a problem-- - Who are you? - Well, this is Eric. Yeah, great. - He's gonna be the next David Warbeck. Huh? Who? - David Warbeck. He was the zombie-busting hero in The Beyond. Come on, man. Here you go, Shelly. Nina. You're here. How great. - I see the regular group of misfits is here. - And he was good. - What? - This David Warbeck guy, he was pretty good? - He was the best, bro. Trust me. I'm a doctor. - That was-- - You're getting really good at that. - So, if this guy was so good then how come we've never heard of him? - Well. - Hey, Paul, Paul. Why don't you go get the stuff ready for the head tear off bit, huh? - Yeah. - All right. - Good idea. - So? - What? - This actor was so good. How come what's his face and I have never heard of him? - Uh, well. You guys obviously don't watch enough horror movies. Trust me, those in the know, they know David Warbeck. - So, we're what you're telling... - Eric. - Eric is that someday, if he plays his cards right, a small and obsessive group of people will know who he is. - Nina, why don't you go get your stuff ready or something, okay? Like, now. Will you excuse me for one minute, please? - Yeah. Thanks. ♪ It's all I know ♪ It's all I know - I thought you said this part was mine. - It is. Look, don't worry. I'm gonna figure something out. Trust me. Shelly. I promise, I'm gonna figure something out, okay? - Okay. You better, because I can be a bitch too, you know? - Yeah, right. Oh, and one more thing. Can you go talk to Eric for me, please? I think Nina just gave him a complex. - Would you relax? You just want everything to be perfect, as usual because it is your first real film. - Yeah, and Nina makin' the other actors scared about their career future doesn't exactly calm me. - I think I can relate to that. But you're doin' a great job. - Yeah? - However, if I did wanna be a bitch in this situation, I could remind you that you broke into this location and are shooting here illegally. Whoa! - Oh you, don't do that to me! - I'm sorry. I can't help it. Wanna see your head? Excuse me? - Ta-da! It's exact. I studied photos of you for days. I probably know your face better than you do. That's, that's nice Paul. - Well, you can have it after the shoot, if you want. - Oh jeez, Paul, that's real sweet of you, but uh, I'll catch you guys later. - Okay. I'll catch you later. Oh, dude. Have I told you how much I lust after your sister? - Ooh, since we were 12 buddy. - It's all comin' together, man. You and me, finally makin' a movie. - Next Romero and Savini, huh? - With Shelly finally starring... Dude, she loved the head. - Really? Wow. She must have been desperate if she finally let ya, huh? - Ha, ha, ha, asshole. You just wait. You and me, we're gonna be related. - Paul, the only head that you're ever gonna get from anything even remotely resembling my sister is that one you got in your hands right now. - And who's to say I haven't already had it? Oh, Shelly, it's a graveyard. My God, have some respect, oh God. - You are truly-- - Oh God. - Truly a sick bastard. And I love you for it. But um... I got some bad news. - What? - Well, we gotta make the head look like Nina. - What? No! No, no, no, no, no. - Look, unfortunately, our little plan to keep her out didn't work, okay, as you so gracefully found out. I told you it wouldn't work. - Well, man, how the hell did she find this place anyhow? I mean, she's always gotten lost before. Well, what are you gonna do, Merlin, huh? Have two people playin' the same role? - I don't know, man. I'm makin' this up as I go. - God. - Look. How long before we're ready to do the head tear off gag? - Well, I don't know, Dave. I'll just whip another one up. That's what I came here to tell you. I can't do it anyhow. - Why not? - Because the PA I sent to get the supplies isn't back yet, okay? - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Shit. Can anybody tell me where Topaz is? - Next. And uh, will that be all? - Can I get eight boxes of condoms? Dry. - Eight. Eight boxes. Anything else? For that private itch. Personal lube. Well, this stuff is great. So I've been told. Okay. That'll be... 69. And uh, you have a great weekend. - Oh, and you go fuck yourself. - Dike. ♪ She's a new generation ♪ The girls are out ♪ She's a side breaker if you don't know ♪ ♪ If you want to feel ♪ Come on, do her up ♪ Cemetery girl ♪ Well, she's back ♪ She's the cemetery girl - Hi Marcus. - Damn. Question, how... How'd you know it was me? - Come on, Marcus. Who else could it be? No one else is that ugly in real life. - Oh ha, ha. Well, for your information, it took Paul nearly two hours to make me look this good. Marcus. - Wait. Forget about that. Did you get everything you needed? - Yeah, I think so. Yep, everything a good effects artist needs, or any 17 year-old with his parents gone for the weekend. - Well, it's a good thing you got here when you did. They've been going crazy waiting for you to show up. - Really? Oh, shit. - 45 minutes. How long's it take to go the store and back? - Dave man, relax. It's not like we're shootin' Titanic and everything costs you 300 Gs. - Yeah, don't remind me. If I had their cappuccino budget I could make four of these movies. - Well, I told ya. You shoulda shot on video. - Real filmmakers shoot on film. Where could she be? - Never fear. Godzilla is here! - I'm really, really, really sorry, but the first store I went to didn't have the dry kind, so I had to go to another one. - Eh, perfecto. - I swear to God, this will never happen again. I really hope I didn't screw you up too badly. Well, you certainly did. - Who are you? - I'm David's sister, little Miss Black, and the one who's helping fund this little project which means, you work for me. - You have two sisters? Great. Well, um, excuse me all to hell, but uh... Just so we're clear, I'm not getting paid so I don't work for you, okay? - Let me tell you something-- Nina, go away. - David, don't talk to me like that. This little girl needs to know-- - Nina, we're behind already, okay? Now, we're almost ready to shoot so why don't you go make sure you know your lines or something? I know my lines. - Now! - Okay. I'm going. For the record, it's Miss Poe to you, got it, kid? - Look, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to cause you any grief, there. - Oh, don't worry about it. - Really? Yeah. - Okay. - But, Shelly and Eric ran off to look around for awhile. Would you go find them and tell them we're about ready to go? - Oh, yeah sure. - Thanks. - So, Dave. If I were you, I'd grab a couple of these bad boys. Looks like you may be needing them later. - Ha. Hey, Chas. - Yeah. - We're back on. - Cool. Let's... Let's shoot this fuckin' thing. - Dude, how does he shoot anything when he wears sunglasses all the time and he's constantly stoned? - I have no idea, but I mean, he's the best I know and can afford. - You know, for your information, pot sharpens the senses. It actually makes some things clearer to some people. Some people. ♪ Fuckin' head ♪ Then he's dead ♪ He got what he deserved ♪ But today's do different ♪ Can't control my nerves ♪ Like a dream but my conscience ♪ ♪ Never sees If you haven't noticed, David has a way of convincing people to do just about anything. Yeah. Well, so how 'bout you? - Me? - Yeah, how'd my brother get you into all this? - He promised me a tape. If I can just get a couple of scenes to put on a reel, I can show them to an agent. The pilot season's coming up, so whatever helps. Besides, Nicholson started out doing this type of crap, right? - I guess. - Not that I want to get typecast in this kind of role. No offense to your brother. Honestly. Do you think I have the look to be a leading man? Oh, God. Pretty creepy, huh? - That's an understatement. You know, maybe we should head back. - Oh come on, just a little further. Call it character motivation. - Yeah well, my character doesn't need this kind of motivation if you get my drift. Eric, let's-- - Shh. What is that? What do you suppose happened in here? I have no idea. I don't like it. Who would trash a room like this and leave the TV on? - Marilyn Manson? Hey look. - Why would anyone leave that behind? - Maybe because they haven't left. - What, are you saying there's someone else in here besides us? - God, I hope not. - Could be homeless people. Lot of times they find these abandoned places and squat in them until they're about to tear them down. - Hey, there's a tape in here. - Is there anything on it? - I don't know. I just found it. - Let me see that. - September 16th, approximately 12:05 a.m. Video log of Eibon. Many months, I've finally broken through the forbidden wall. I stand at death's door. My chosen subjects, too, successfully-- - What is so funny? Are showing an unnatural-- - Oh, come on. Isn't this obvious? - I guess not. - This has got to be part of my brother's film. - You think? - Oh! - What have I gotten myself into? - Welcome to the wonderful world of low-budget films, pal. - Hey, what's so funny? - Oh! Jesus! Christ, what is wrong with you? - Sorry. I'm sorry, I just really can't help myself. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you that badly. Anyway, David's ready for you. We're ready to shoot. - Great. The sooner I get outta here, the better. Can't take much more of this. - Oh, look Shelly, I'm sorry. I really didn't mean to scare you like that. - I know, that's cool, but um... David left a tape in that camera. Why don't you get it and hurry back to set? - Okay. - Knowing my sister, if you've met her, she's probably noticed you've been gone. - Yeah, I met her all right. Don't think she likes me much. - Of course not. You're David's type. She, she hates that. She'd probably rip your head off if she could. More blood! Paul, that's great! Cut! That was awesome! - Eat your heart out, Gino De Rossi, uh huh. - Question, is, is this stuff supposed to sting your eyes? Marcus, lean back. - Oh man, this stuff is really stinging. - Dude, you gotta lean back so I can flush out your eyes. - So, did you guys find anything cool or... - Not really. What happened here? - Oh, we just ripped Nina's head off. - Damn. - Ha, bet you've wanted to do that your whole life. - You have no idea. - Oh, Topaz found you guys, right? - You mean Morticia? - She found us, all right. Took about a year off my life in the process. - Well, where is she now? Marcus, come in. - Yeah, Topaz, what's up? Is everyone up there? - Yeah. I think so. - Great. Tell everybody to come down here to the office that Eric and Shelly were in. They are never gonna believe what I found. - Here it is. Found it. Whoa. - So, where's Nina? - Probably lost. Or maybe she found someone else's movie to fuck up. Oh, did I say that? - Whoo. - So, what do you think? - It's perfect. - Hold on a sec. I'm sorry, I don't mean to be the voice of sanity here, but, this place is obviously not as deserted as we thought. We can't stay here. - What are you, crazy? - Yeah, come on, Shelly. We been all over this place and we haven't seen anybody. Where's the sense of adventure, huh? - You're gonna have to come up with something better than a lame dare like that. Look at this thing, I mean, you guys. Does anyone else see a resemblance to a coffin? - Yeah. - Fuckin' hey. - You know, there could be hundred reasons why this thing is here. - Yeah, name one, good one. - Maybe it's some sort of '50s cryogenics project. - Yeah, it kinda looks like a big refrigerator. - Yeah. - Listen to me, guys. This place is really not deserted and I think we need to get outta here before they come back. I'm sorry, David, but it's not worth it. - Not worth it? What do you think I'm doin' here? This isn't some backyard thing I'm doing for shits and giggles. I'm trying to make a movie. - Yeah, and there will be other movies. - I can't believe you're sayin' this. - Whoa, whoa. Time out, sibs. Look, Shelly, hey. David's right. I mean, we can't quit now. Look, it's already nighttime so if somebody was gonna show up, they'd have been here already. I mean, I say we shoot all night, get as much stuff as we can, then jet outta here in the morning. I mean, guys. Look at this thing. And it's like it was made for us. It's... It's perfect. - Jesus! Christ. I think we just found the owner. - Is he dead? - Why don't check for pulse, that way, you can find out for sure. No thanks. What are you doing? - Well, I think we should at least turn him over or something. - Oh, God. Oh, jeez. - Who do you think he was? - I think Marcus is right. This is probably the guy that was using this stuff. - Well, does he have any ID on him? - How can you do that? - Well, part of being a good makeup artist is studying anatomy so it looks real. You just gotta disconnect yourself from it and pretend that it isn't really freakin' you out. No, nothing. - So, what are we gonna do? I mean, we should really notify somebody or something, right? Yeah. Yeah. - Why? - What, David? - Why do we have to notify anyone? What do you mean? - Well, don't you guys see? I mean, if we call somebody, then that's it. Movie's over. The cops or whoever, they're gonna roll in here, they're gonna confiscate our film as evidence and we're all gonna be right back to where we started. Paul, you'll be back slinging foam, man, for Subhuman creations hopin' someday maybe they'll let you be an on-set assistant. Chas, you'll be back shootin' weddings, bro. Yeah, Eric, you know I, I hope you get that dandruff commercial, man. Or that quick walk-on on Seventh Party. I hope you like makin' copies, really. And you know, what have we worked for this whole time? And Marcus, I don't know what you did before. But my point is is that we all go back to the end of the line, here. Takin' shit from people that are half as talented and dedicated about makin' movies as we are. - So, what are you saying, David? What should we do? - I say we keep going. In fact, I say we use it. - Whoa, wait a minute, what? - Just think about it, you guys. What do have here that no other living dead movie has ever had? A real corpse, right? Just think about it, kids would race to see a living dead movie with real corpses in it. It would be the ultimate, man. - Have you completely lost your fucking minds? I can't believe you're even seriously considering this. Any of you, this is fucking sick! - Shelly, just calm down. - No, no, no, don't touch me. I don't even know you any more. This movie has completely made you lose your mind. I mean, first you just hand my part over to Nina. Big surprise there, but now you wanna use a dead body in some stupid little movie? I don't want any part of this. I'm outta here. Shelly, wait. - Marcus, will you go make sure she gets to the front safely, please? - Yeah, sure. - Thanks. Look, you guys. I know what I'm asking you all to do here is... Well, it's a little unorthodox. But I don't know what else to do. But I'm not gonna force anybody to do this if they don't want to. - Look, man. I know it's, it's fucked up and all, yeah, but... I'm not gonna quit. I'm with you, bro. You know that. Always. - Shit, dude. It's twisted. But it's not like we killed the guy. I'm in. Mmm hmm. - Eric, you okay, man? - Dave, I don't know if I can do this. - No one's forcing you, bro, okay? - I don't know, I don't know. I mean, we're not gonna go to hell for this, are we? - Dude. - I mean, God, I wanna be an actor, but, I don't wanna damn my soul for it. - Look, just do what you have to, all right? - You promise me this is gonna get me noticed? - Eric, trust me, man. You're gonna be the next Dick Miller. - Ooh. - This is gonna be a great story to tell on Leno. - Who's Dick Miller? - Well. Looks like it's up to you, huh? Do we stay? Or do we go? - Well. I guess we could always call the police afterward, right? - All right people. We got a long night ahead of us, right? So let's shoot this fucker. Yeah. - Shelly. - What are you doing here? - Your brother sent me to make sure you're all right. - How thoughtful of him. I'm sure he feels just terrible. - He seemed pretty upset. - He's still shooting, isn't he? - Can I get ya anything, or? - No, I just want a few minutes alone, okay? Yeah, no problem. - Close your eyes. Okay. You're all set. - God, it's good to be out of that stuff. Feel like myself again. - Why would you want that? - Oh, well... - So, everybody ready? - You know it. - Yeah, pretty much. - Good, okay Eric, now make sure you know your lines, okay? 'Cause we're runnin' late. We gotta get this in one take, okay? Great. - One take. Could you help me out for a sec? Sure thing, buddy. No problemo. Great. Oh, yeah. Him. Yeah, him. We gotta get him back into this thing. Okay. Yeah, okay. Okay? Yeah. So, uh, on three. One, two, three. Ah! Jesus! - What are you doing? - Fuck you, man. He breathed. - That's just pent-up gas in the body. Now, come on, everyone's watching. - Sorry, guys. First corpse. Come on. Okay. Okay. Okay. Stinks. Door. - Okay, yeah. Okay. Okay, that wasn't so bad, huh? - Well, you let me know when it gets bad, okay? - Mr. Poe? - Yeah. - I've been looking at this thing and I think I've figured out how to power it up. Really? - Yeah, I think so. See here? It looks like everything has been routed to one coaxial cable, so all we really have to do now is juice her up. Not exactly sure what this thing does, but, I've a feeling it's gonna be a whole lot cooler with it on. - That's great, Topaz, that's great. Look, I hope you didn't take that stuff my sister said earlier too personally. - Oh you know. She's just protective of ya. - Yeah, she's protective all right. She's kind of like a lion with her cubs, you know? Yeah. - Yeah. Now, it's just that things are, like, they're weird enough already, you know? And uh... I don't know. Just, I'd hate it if you left. - Well you know. Stuck around this long. Guess I'll wait and see how things turn out. Besides, Nina hasn't been around, right, so things are already lookin' up. - Thanks, Topaz. - Oh, and Chas? Uh huh. - Call me Paul. Everyone else does. - Oh, and Topaz? Just call me Dave. Everybody does. Okay people, we ready to shoot or what? Eric. Okay. You're gonna want to start back here, okay, at the machine. Right? Right. - And you wanna throw this switch, which is gonna power it up. - Okay. - Okay? You wanna take this medallion type thing, right, and you're gonna put it in this hole, which we're gonna pretend is gonna bring back your army of the dead, okay? - Right. - Great. - Sounds good. - Let's roll. Let's shoot this. - Lemme just get these work lights. Rock and roll. - Action! - Yes, my lovely dead thing. After years of struggling, I have found the way to bring you back. You will lead my army of the dead so that I can avenge all those who mocked me. Tonight will bring the end of mankind. - Eric, don't stop. Live. Live! Live! - Keep going. Open it. - What the hell? What the fuck! - At least he got it in one take. - No, David! - Oh, God. Oh fuckin' shit! Get me up, get me up! Someone get me the fuck outta here! Get me up. Somebody fuckin' help me! - Make them die. Slowly. Which way? Come on. - You guys? Where are you? David? I'm lost. Shit. Can't believe this. You guys better not be filming without me! - Jesus Christ, man. Did you see that? - 'Course I saw it. - What the fuck is goin' on? - I don't know, dude. Shit, come on. Come on. Check and see if any of these doors are unlocked. Shit! Chas. - What? Oh fuck. Die! Let's go. Let's go! Come on, let's go! Shit! Who the hell chains an emergency exit? - People who don't want people comin' in under stupid, sappy experiments. God, God dammit! All we need is an ax or something! - Like that one? - Oh, God. This is just not fair. Stand back, stand back. Help me through. - Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! What the fuck, dude? Jesus Christ, Chas! What the fuck, man? Ah, Jesus. - Time to bring you back to the land of the living. Ellie. Never again. - Oh, thank God. I finally found this place. Where'd everyone else go? Oh, no. - Go. Bring the rest to me. Tonight the dead will rule forever. Don't fear. The others will be here soon. - What could be taking them so long? - I don't know. I thought you were gonna leave, anyway. - I am. I just wanna make sure David makes it back okay. - Question, weren't you just disgusted with him just a little while ago? - Do you have any brothers or sisters, Marcus? - Me? No, no. I guess after my parents had me, they decided one was enough. Wait. That didn't come out right. - Well, lemme tell you somethin'. Unfortunately, your family can do some pretty messed up things. But when it comes down to it, nothing's thicker than blood. Marcus! Are you there? - Yeah, I'm here, Topaz. We got a really bad signal. Listen, - Okay. That's a roger there, Topaz. I'm on my way. I guess they're all done. Must need help lugging the gear back. Do you wanna come along? - No, I think I'll wait right here for the happy little band of degenerates to come back. - Okay well, we shouldn't be too long. - Repeat Marcus, I need you to go and get help, over. Marcus! God dammit, Marcus! Why don't you answer me? All clear. - Oh, God. Oh, my God. What the hell are we gonna do? - I don't know. Gimme a minute. I'm still trying to grasp the fact that I'm living my movie, okay? - Hey. We don't have a minute, okay? Marcus is on his way down here. Those things are out there wandering around. - I know, I'm sorry, but this kind of stuff doesn't happen to me every day, okay? Okay, think. What would Bruce Campbell do? - Hey, news flash. This isn't your movie. It's reality. Are you okay? - No, of course not! Let's get the fuck outta here! That could be a problem. - I see they put you back in that shit. Don't blame me. I told you my brother can convince anyone to do just about anything. Have to admit, you lasted longer than I thought you would. I bet he told you you'd be a big star and everything. I hate to burst your bubble, but my brother's the biggest bullshit artist I know. Take a good long look at yourself in the mirror. This is as good as it gets. Whole lot of shattered dreams. All clear. What do you see? - Not much, it's pretty dark. Smells kinda funny though, like, like biology class. Here, take my arms. Shit. What? I dropped the tape. What tape? - Oh, wait. I've got my lighter. Oh, Jesus. They just keep gettin' worse. Who are they? I don't know. What does it say? - Just a number and a date. But if I was gonna take a guess, I'd say that Sam Raimi extra we found in that machine is pretty busy tryin' to bring these guys back. Ooh. God, why would anyone want to bring back the dead? - Why try to create a master race? Or a bomb that can kill anything within a 10-mile radius? 'Cause they're fuckin' crazy. - No, no, no, this is, this is one guy, David. This isn't some government funded thing. He was working alone. No. Something had to have happened to make him do this. - Well, no offense, but I'm a little more interested in trying to get outta here in one piece, not why some nut job's tryin' to bring the dead back to life. No, wait, wait, wait a second. - What? The tape. - What the hell is so important about that video tape? - Look, Shelly and Eric found it in the office next to the lab. At first, I thought it was footage that you shot. That's what they told me, but after everything that's happened, I think maybe it's that guy's. - Well, maybe there's something on there that can tell us what the hell's going on? - Exactly. I found it. - Jesus, one's alive. But look at it. Barely even can move. - What are you doing? - This may be our only chance to find out what they want. - They want us dead, Topaz. No big surprise there. - Who are you? - Eibon. - Ellie. - What do you want? - To kill the living. - Why? - Hate the living. Love the dead. - What do you want from us? - Die! - To die. - Yeah, well you first. - No! Ellie! - See? I told you. That's all they ever want. Can we get outta here now? - Which way now? Any more questions? Not really. - Marcus, get the fuck outta here, now! - What's the problem? Oh Marcus, run! - Oh. - Living. - Question. - Not long now. Come on, he's dead. Let's get outta here. Come on! - Take him back now. - Stop! Oh! - Paul, thank God, man. I thought, I thought-- - Don't go out there. Why not? - Where's Chas? - Chas went outside. - He did? He made it? - No, he didn't. Oh. - Paul, what do you mean, man? What's out there? - Death. Listen, listen to me. I've been thinkin' about it the whole time I was hiding and the only thing I can figure is that when we turned on that machine, it put us in some kind of limbo. - How is that possible? - Are cadavers coming back from the dead a common thing in your world? - Yeah. - Kinda of, yeah. - Well, what are we gonna do, then? - Well, dude, there's only thing we can do. We gotta shut the damn thing off. - How? Those things are down there and call me nuts, but I don't think they're gonna let us just walk down there and turn that thing off. - Well, I don't know, man, but we better do somethin' or we're gonna end up like the others. - He's right. There's no way to escape your fate. So, why don't you come with us and die like you're supposed to? - No. If you want us, you're gonna have to catch us, you undead fuck. - Yeah, and we're fast. - Mmm, just how I like it. Messy. - Oh, wait a minute. Look at you, man. You're just one. So, what's to stop us from comin' up there and knockin' your ass back in the grave where it belongs? - Just one? Oh, now what? - Party time. - Time to die. - What are we gonna do? - We've got two choices: fight or die. - Oh man, those aren't the options I was lookin' for. - Topaz, stay behind us. - Huh uh. I didn't go to rape prevention classes to be a token damsel, here. - Why didn't you tell me you had that thing before? - I don't know. - Dave, I just got one thing to say to you, man. - Yeah, what's that? - This is all your fault and if I die, you better dedicate that Fango Award to me. - Deal. - Oh, that's just great. ♪ You better bring it out ♪ Too slow - Topaz! Shit! Come on, Paul. Grab your case. What? - Just do it, grab it. Find somethin' to barricade the door! No! Oh my God, Marcus. - So, you want to know my secrets. - Please don't kill me. - I'm not going to, my lovely. You want to know my secrets, then I shall show them to you first hand, but I think I'll play awhile. You're so much prettier than my wife. You pray, pretty thing? - What are we gonna do? - We gotta go back down to the lab and save Topaz. - We could wait 'til dawn. Maybe they'll go away. They'll go away at dawn. - Check your watch, man. Time doesn't exist. You were right. Whatever that machine is, it's trapped us in some kind of netherworld. There won't be another dawn for us unless we destroy that thing. - Well, how are we gonna do that, man? We got no guns, we got no weapons. We got nothin'! It's like you said. They're not gonna just let us walk in there. - Actually, that's exactly what I had in mind. - That's it, man. What are these? - Those are those new remote squibs I scored. Looks like we won't get a chance to use those though, huh? Here, take 'em. You never know. Foreshadowing? Hardly. We'll need everything we use. - Yeah? That reminds me. I was savin' this for when the shoot was over, but, under the circumstances... Cheers, bro. You think this is gonna work? - I don't know. We stay here, those things are gonna get in here sooner or later. Hey man, save some of that. We don't wanna be drunk and do this. Yeah. We ready? - No. Not really. Let's do it. You realize man, if we get through this, we have one hell of a movie on our hands. Yeah, I bet John Carpenter didn't have to go through this to get Halloween made. Well. - All right, remember, slow stiff moves. - No, stop it! Stop it please! Oh, please stop. Make 'em stop, please. - Don't worry, they won't kill you. I've other plans for you. It has occurred to me that I've never experimented with a living entity before. You could be the key to bring our two worlds together, then we can extinguish all the disgusting life from your world, glorious mega death. - Then do it. If that's what you want so badly, then just fuckin' do it, get it over with. - Yes, it is time. - Dude, I can't believe that worked. - Dude, You look rad. Kiss my ass, K and B. Yeah. - So, what's the plan? When we get in there? - I don't know. - What? - What do you want, man? I'm scared shitless. - Oh, great. - I'm just goin' with my gut. - Dave. You know, she might not be alive. - Yeah, I know. She's alive. You killed my wife. Now, you'll take her place. Someone please help me. - Okay, you grab the TV and when I say, we'll rush in. You throw that thing at the machine to distract 'em and I'll go get Topaz. - What? Dude, you want me to throw a TV at them? - Well, you got a better idea? Let's hear it. If not, time's up and Topaz is dead. - Fine, fuck it. Dave throw fuckin' TV at 'em. - Okay, new plan. - Why fight for such a wasted thing as life? You are about to be reawakened and become part of a new world, a world where loss and pain are non-existent. This is salvation and not damnation. - Fuck you. - Perhaps when you return. Put her in the chamber! - Creepazoid. - No! Kill him! Let her go. Come on, come on. Come on, come on! That's it. Come on, that's right. You guys are gonna like this one. Mmm hmm. Come on, come on. It's called zombie barbecue. Here goes. Lights. Camera. Action. - I said let her go. You're the only one left. All your things are gone. - Not all of them. - That's a wrap. That's a wrap. Shelly? Paul. - Shelly! Shelly, you're alive! Oh my God. Oh my God, I thought you were-- - Kiss me loverboy! God. - You may have stopped the others, but there's always more dead. I think this one could be most entertaining. - You know, I think I'm over this whole goth thing. Shut down the machine, now! - You living fools! You have destroyed your only way out of here. The portal cannot be closed now that the chamber is destroyed. You have damned yourselves. I have won. - That's a wrap, fucker. Jesus, Paul. Fuck. Oh God dammit. - Dave. There you are. I'm okay. I got 'em, man. The zombie barbecue. Fuck, Paul, fuck. - She scratched me, Dave. She scratched. She bit my mouth. I don't wanna die, not like this. Hang on, man. - They're comin'. Dave, go, go. - I'm not fuckin' leavin' you, man. - Get the fuck outta here, Dave. Go! - Dave, we have to go! Get outta here! - David.
