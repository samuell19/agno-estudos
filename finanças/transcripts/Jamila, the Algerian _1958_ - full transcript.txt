**translated from French subtitles** (missing lines/scenes) My homeland... Yours... The homeland of every Arab... Algeria! My country... Your country.... The country of every Arab... Algeria! My land, your land... The land of every Arab You split it to obtain food for your children. To defend it wouldn't you also split the heart of your oppressor? It's my land. Chase me from it to give it to my oppressors? It's my life. Take it from me, have me killed? You are hungry, and they are full. Poverty is killing you, and they live in luxury. World War II broke out... Suddenly, your life became valuable France went down on its knees... Arab of Algeria! Hero of History! Us? French Soldiers? Defend our enemy who stole our land? Stand by us in these hard times, And we swear on the honor of France We will give back your liberty. -And they cheated us! France cheated us. We believed in them, in their honor And our men went to liberate France We fought, We gave our blood... Our lives, our youth... for the victory of the allies. The victory of Algeria. They were victorious We were victorious. There were parades everywhere celebrating the victory. In France... the joy of being liberated from the shame of the German occupation. In Algeria, the hope that France would keep its promise And liberate us from the shame of the French occupation Didn't we pay the price? Didn't we save them from the shame of the occupation? Didn't we allow them to hold their heads high again? And here is the price: Scattered limbs What's left of us... Our wounded... And the thousands who never came back You fought to the death For France... For Algeria What was the price? The liberty of Algeria... Where is it? We demand liberty. In the name of our martyrs In the name of our scattered limbs In the name of the orphans In the name of the disabled We want Algeria We want liberty. We want to live. Algeria... belongs to France. Liberty... is for the French. Death... is for the Algerians. Death... for the Algerians. (Down with Imperialism! Out! Out! Out!) 45 thousand martyrs fell Beneath French bullets the day of victory. France was on its knees in Paris And wears a lion's skin in Algeria. Killing, devastation, pillage and humiliation We pull their head out of the mud and they throw us back into it! We resuscitate them... And they take our lives. We give them freedom... And they reduce us to slavery. We restore their dignity And they humiliate us. Yes, we were tricked. But will we let ourselves be tricked again? NO We will only regain our freedom by fighting And sacrificing everything And the mobilization has begun We have assembled our forces to prepare for combat In order to liberate Algeria The old... The young... Women... Children... And... Djamila! I was still a young girl... I had seen the French chase us from our lands To take possession of them Why? What had we done? My cousin lost his legs. Why? How many times did I ask myself this question: Why? I only understood it once I had grown up And it's also thanks to my Uncle He told my father, "Djamila needs an education" "Education is the weapon with which we will fight the enemy." Uncle Mustafa came to take us, my brother Hadi and me, To bring us- On the way, I saw beautiful houses I thought that we would live there But Uncle told me, "They belong to the French." Their houses? Why? Why weren't they ours? And I knew the response... Here in the Kasbah The neighborhood where I lived The French? They deprived us of everything. Our land, our harvests, our food And how were we supposed to live? It's my story... and yours the story of every Arab. The story of every Arab. "The Napoleonic Code" I found it on the floor in the hall Uncle... Breakfast is ready Thank you. Goodbye. Djamila... Djamila! You aren't going to say hello to me? Could it be? Hello, grandfather. I found this gun... an automatic Thank you. Sorry to bother you. Anything to make you happy. Amina! Do you always go to school with Amina? Never anyone else? Never. Amina! No other friends? Your head's not on right. Amina! She's coming down -Hello, Aunt How are you, Ali? -I'm not talking to you anymore Not talking to your fiancee? Where's the rifle you promised me? Tomorrow, darling -You put everything off until tomorrow! Tomorrow, the rifle, tomorrow, our marriage... Nothing for today? Hello, beautiful You're a pain! Come on, we'll be late for school... -There's no hurry Don't quarrel early in the morning Did you finish your composition? -I had to stay up all night For the composition or the Voice of the Arabs? (Traitor: Youssef Dead or Alive, 500,000 fr) I managed to shut him up, that teacher And if he had punished us? It doesn't matter! At least I stopped him from trumpeting their lies... "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity" Nothing but lies! -Let them keep Equality and Fraternity, and leave Liberty for us! -We'll take Liberty! -Peacefully, Amina, not by force -No! By force! -Youssef! Be reasonable, honestly! -Youssef, a traitor? -Let them put their posters up everywhere Everybody knows who Youssef is... Is that Youssef? -No, it's your Aunt! How many of those 500,000 francs did your father pay? He can tell his masters that they won't catch him Even if they offer an award of all the treasures on Earth! My father is Judge Habib! -Who loves France! -You're impolite! -It's the least one can do with a traitor! -I'll tell the Dean and advise the police! -After all, we are fellow citizens! -She should know who her father is -Enough of this, I'll have you put in prison! -Hassiba! Don't get involved Denounce your classmates? Your sisters, your compatriots Have you forgotten that you are Algerian, Hassiba? You'll never forgive yourself They are excusable... One lost her father and uncle for the country The other saw her three brothers shot Both of their hearts bleed You should console them, not denounce them I'll go with you? -You're so different... Your house is a paradise -Stay for a bit Only five minutes Are you afraid you'll be reproached for having been at Judge Habib's house? -What an idea! Colonel Bigeard, Captain Benoit at Judge Habib's house? It's an occasion! -But we come every day. If only all Algerians were like you! -Let's not concern ourselves with them You aren't responsible for their presence here. I always hoped to have you as a friend. -Have you calmed down? Will you forgive Amina? -And I'd like her to forgive me You have dogs? -That's Whisky. He doesn't bite. Azzam. What does this mean? -You don't care for anything but your dog anymore You pamper it, you kiss it. And you forget me It's either him or me in this house. -Jealous of Whisky? -I'm dying of Jealousy. -You are my cousin and my fiancé. -And what else? And what else? -And my love. -Pat my cheek. Kiss me. -Have some shame! Not in front of Djamila! Djamila. Azzam is my fiancé. -Your name's Djamila? -Djamila Bouhired -You're very beautiful. I have to pay my respects. -Djamila doesn't like these jokes. -I'm an Existentialist. I lived on St Germain-des-Prés for 10 years -Clearly. What work do you do? -Why work? I'm very rich. -And after you've eaten through your fortune? -By the time my father's inheritance dries out My uncle, the Judge will be... -Don't you have any blood in your veins! -Are you afraid of your father's death? You're so stupid... ...And then, he'll be a martyr! -Is that how you become a martyr? -Nothing could be easier. Better to live in cowardice than die heroically Leaving so soon? -Because of the curfew. -I'll take you in a car. -Cars don't go into the Kasbah. I must have exaggerated a little -A little? Get lost! -Forgive me, Hassiba! My love, my fiancée, my cousin! Who's there? -Five Who's there? Isaac, what are you doing here? -No news from the commandos, Haroun? -Come here, I'll tell you Hadi, I'm really worried -And her brother tells her: Pacifists are always worried I'm going to go see Amina Surely she'll be listening to the Voice of the Arabs She took too long... -Didn't you... No. I was at her house after 6. She wasn't there. I'm really worried France has captured five of your leaders Ben Bella, Khidir, Aït Ahmed, Boudiaf and Ashraf France thinks that by capturing your leaders it will put an end to... France thinks that by committing this crime it will put an end to your revolt But you have learned that everything Imperialism believes is illusory Amina, where were you? -Nowhere I'll tell you later. Tomorrow at the university Good night. -Did you hear Voice of the Arabs? Open! I said open! Amina went out -Alone? -She went for a little walk Before going to the university As I said, in 1830... The French conquered Africa and Asia And taught them the principles of the French Revolution "Liberty, Equality and Fraternity" "Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité" Let's study together: Who are the most famous heroes of the Mainland France And the French Overseas Territories? Who wants to answer? Miss Hassiba You don't want to answer? -I don't remember I said I don't remember -I'll teach you to never forget Miss Dubois. -Napoleon Bonaparte! Bravo! Miss Djamila. Miss Djamila. Who else? Speak! Speak! Speak! It was the police station! Safe and sound, Mr. Robert? -Everyone return to your seats Quick! What are you waiting for? -Careful, Mr. Robert! Don't hit the table anymore! Take your places. Amina, where were you? What's wrong? -Not now. Don't draw attention. Where were you? Look after my mother and my brother. Haroun is a traitor... a spy. Don't worry, I took my precautions. Poison? No! Is everyone here today? -There's one named Amina... She didn't come today. Police! Police! There's Amina! You won't answer? -Where were you? She's been shot Youssef was with you, wasn't he? Leave her alone! Leave her alone! Leave her alone! -Go back to your seats or I'll shoot! Djamila, don't forget my mother and my brother! Back to the lesson! Take your seats! Leyla, Zohra, Djamila! They are Emir Kader, Emir Khaled, El Mokrani... And in the present day, Ben Bella, Boudiaf, Hocine Aït Ahmed- And Amina! Amina! Amina! I could have made her talk In Indochina I learned how to make these dogs talk I have a thousand ways. -But these idiots... -The only idiot is you. -Don't be angry, Colonel Bigeard The foreign legion will bring you her mother and her brother. Thank you Captain Benoit, But don't bother We know how to do it. Your commander wants these papers Jeanine, is the injection ready? Uncle, the bathtub is full -Did you add soap? I'll be right there Where were you, Djamila? Forget her. Go and study your lessons. The books will instruct you. Learn from these books? The books are full of lies! -Education guarantees your future. You are completely different from Amina. Amina had a principle and an aim in her life I would have liked to be like Amina I want to be like Amina! I am Algerian! Where is Algeria in these books? I don't see any Algeria in these books... Or in this house Uncle... What good is living? Why keep quiet? Did god create us to kill each other? To hate each other? Why? Why? Why get us involved? Stay quiet and safe. You're a coward... a coward... Coward! Quick! Turn off the lights! Youssef? My Uncle, a commando! They went to the other side So it was Haroun? -Yes, he denounced Amina. I didn't know who to tell -To your uncle, Mustafa I didn't know he was a commando Uncle, I... -The bravest girl in the world They're coming here! -Come quick Who's here with you? -My brother and my uncle. -Who's singing? -My uncle is taking his bath. Djamila, Hadi, who's making that noise? Did a war break out? Who are you? -Your name! -Mustafa Bouhired Show me your face Your papers? Can I go get them from the bedroom? -Here's the ID card That's me... in clothes! A great idea! -Luckily we made it through Go to sleep, my girl -I'll tidy things up Djamila is great. -We have to quickly contact the man from the Front. -Any orders to take? -With the utmost urgency... Take this We've decided to kill Haroun -I'll get dressed and go see the man from the Front Can I stay? She was very devoted. -We all have this fate. Don't be selfish... Amina is not the only one who deserves tears. How many Aminas have died for Algeria? If we had to cry for all those who fell... We would spend our whole lives crying. -Is there no other way but war? - We tried everything. Blood will free Algeria... not tears Tears stifle the desire for vengeance We have to fight... And me? What can I do? At your age every girl wants love, home, and children -Why tell me that? Love is a betrayal If it's not love for Algeria A home in a colonized country is a prison, a shame! The children of slaves... ...For whom we haven't built a more worthy life! I am Algerian and my uncle is a commando I feel the same way as Amina I'm ready to die like her ...Shouting "Long live Algeria!" Please accept me We'll hold a meeting right away. We should tell Bouazza So she can let the others know. Djamila. -Me? Me? (Grand Post Office) Miss Bouazza, telephone! Too many people around We're together, let's talk before you get to the counter. Regular mail or express? Airmail, of course. The lucky winner is waiting impatiently -Could you do me a favor? Buy me a pencil? -A dozen! Three by air and two for 10 francs Where are you sending the airmail? -To Egypt And the 10 francs? Two. 5 francs each. New? Here's the pencil. -Keep it for yourself. (women) Some idiot followed me but I managed to lose him. What can I do for you? If you don't want to talk, go away My uncle is here, you'll have to deal with him. Get out! The comrade we were waiting for Always late -I put the new one to the test. First of all, know that Djamila will replace Amina Any objections? I'll do my best to be worthy of being your comrade. An important message from the man from the Front From the Society of Commercial Enterprises... To its agent in Algeria. The clients have learned the location of the depot of macaroni received from... Macaroni? I forgot that you don't know the code All our messages are in code In case they fall into enemy hands I'll translate as I go: The French have learned the location of The cache of arms... (macaroni) ...received from a brotherly Arab country Their documents are in Bigeard's office I want to photograph them today I cannot go to Bigeard's without a reason So I will use your decision to kill Haroun at the Fantasio and- I'll warn Bigeard Like this, I will gain his confidence And be able to photograph the documents So the French will know in advance that Haroun will be killed And who will do it? God damn him... he was my friend The man from the Front will kill several birds with one stone: Photograph the documents Get rid of Haroun And gain the trust of the French And if the French have been warned? Give me a gun with a silencer And lend me Bouazza Rest assured it's for the mission Hello, Colonel -Hello, Judge Habib I have important news Jeanine, is the injection ready? -Yes, Colonel Just a moment Dr Jeanine is punctuality incarnate I was sure I would find her here now Important news, I hope? Jeanine, take care, thank you. -Goodbye, Colonel The commandos are going to kill Haroun tonight Let them kill him. -They're going to do it at the Fantasio How? -I don't know, but you have to... -arrest the assassin. Judge Habib, if what you say is true, you are... Tonight, right? -Graziani! Good evening Colonel... Captain. -How are you Haroun? -The soldiers are behaving themselves: no damage, no fights But the ambiance is a little gloomy -Are there any Algerians? -Our regular, Azzam. Azzam, my friend, take your friend and get out of here quick -But I like it here -It's going to get rough... He's drunk That's enough, they've gone -Let me do my job Azzam, remember our saying: Young, an Algerian is your daughter... Old, she is you mother As a young woman, she is... -My grandfather! -No news from the commandos, Isaac? I couldn't find anything out They're leaving us in peace for the moment Mr Graziani... Mr Bigeard wants to see you Good evening, Mr Benoit You're in a good mood tonight... My dear... You're an ass. What's wrong with them tonight? You'd think we're at a funeral. -Nervous, Haroun? A little movement, some ambiance -Yes, Colonel? -Haroun, come keep me company Sit next to me... Azzam, it's time! I'm worried Simone will forget to take the gun -Don't worry Ah, the beautiful Simone! -Ah, the beautiful Simone! Why are you helping us Simone? Anyone else in my place would have done the same thing Two years ago in Cyprus... Soldiers like them killed my mother, my father, and my three brothers So, for you, we take the place of your family And for you, Azzam is... A grandfather! As long as the man from the Front can photograph the documents... The French are planning the destruction of Beni Salah And the massacre of all its inhabitants: Men, women and children. That's why... The man from the Front's orders. He photographed the documents... We have to put two cases of worn-out munitions Into the Bond warehouse Because that's where they think the weapons are. At the same time, we'll carry out our plan. -Once you have collected the weapons... Each person will leave on their own, at 2 minute intervals And follow the indicated path ...When you have reached the stairs of the Kasbah. Near my uncle's house You will wait for the signal from Bouazza Who will be on the balcony. When she touches her hair like this The person whose turn it is will go towards the bakery While keeping an eye on Amina's house- Where Youssef and I will be, behind the shutters. We will give a signal in case of danger For each person who goes into the shop There will be another who leaves, carrying a bookbag. If we are surprised by the patrol And you have gone past the carpet shop... Do your best to reach the bakery A number of comrades will be in position on the streetcorners To advise you so that you will be able to make it To either the bakery or the carpet shop Understood? These munitions represent the future of the country And your role, while banal, has its importance The major battle is the sum of all the smaller battles. Good luck. Any questions? If the French attack We will have to blow up the bakery. Ali! Where did you find him uncle? -He was wandering the streets. His mother was imprisoned. My darling! Did they torture you? Bouazza, take him to the doctor. We have to put an end to their criminal acts! -The man from the front said in his message That as in retaliation The French plan to destroy Beni Salah And massacre all of its inhabitants: Men, women and children. We have to prevent this act of savagery. Abdel Kader has a plan. He has assembled his troops. But he needs weapons. We will supply him the weapons. -They are the ones who will be exterminated! I hope we won't have to use it... Me too. But if we are forced to... (Bakery) Give another signal The sign for danger! What's inside? -Books Did we do all that just for this junk? Impossible... -I swear on my honor! This is all we found. -Don't talk about honor... These aren't the weapons... These aren't the weapons! Rudolph! Zohra has gone -Only Fatma and two others are left We'll have pulled one over on Bigeard When will we transport the munitions to the mountain? -Tomorrow Youssef, a patrol! Go back! They saw us A foreign legion patrol... What are you doing? Where are you going? -The girls! We have to save the others! Fatma! Go back! Go Back! My uncle... My uncle... -He's alright They've left -Good. -Your uncle will be released from the camp -Nobody leaves there alive... -My father will intercede on his behalf with Bigeard I know what they say about my father... By I have to profit from my friendship with the French Your uncle must be released! -Long live Hassiba! Excuse me This man, Bouhired, has he confessed? -Nothing at all -The Algerians asked me to intercede on his behalf For him to be freed. -Impossible. -I told them it was impossible! Intercede on behalf of a traitor to France? But I'm in a delicate situation... Judge Habib! -I know what you're going to say In the eyes of the Algerians I am a traitor But if I help one of them... They'll change their mind about me! And I could be of an even greater service to you -Yes, but Benoit will be furious. -What does Benoit's opinion matter to you? You could be of an even greater service to us... That's French tactics! Do you want to dance, sir? -With pleasure... Azzam! My darling, my cousin, my fiancé! What does this mean? -We're even. Do you have any message for me? I'm doing well now. -I have good news for you -14 lots of arms made it to the mountain They were given to Abdel Kader And there's more Your uncle will be freed tomorrow. -My uncle... So much good news at once? That's why you came... -And also so you could reassure me... For me, your tears foretell our victory The day when every Algerian will shed tears of joy. And we will forget these difficult times Take care... Welcome back... I told them you were a man and would never cry Welcome back, Bouhired! How was he released? Halt! Come here! Isn't he the one we arrested at the bakery? He must have gotten away! What else? -Your permit. You just took it. -So you're here without a permit! Move along! Come clean up these dogs! From now on, no more commandos! No more Algeria! Nothing but France! Nothing but France! Abdel Kader and I have made a plan To teach the Foreign Legion a lesson -We have to avenge the Kasbah's martyrs 600 killed in this massacre... Djamila showed unbelievable bravery If something should happen to her it would be an irreparable loss... Abdel Kader wants to see you right away Come clean up these dogs! From now on, no more Algeria! Nothing but France! Ah, Youssef I heard what happened in the Kasbah I couldn't act without your orders I will kill them all in broad daylight, in Algiers itself I'm thinking of setting a trap for the officers Right in front of the French's eyes Simone will invite them to the Milk Bar for her birthday When is her birthday? - - - - The Voice of the Arabs! -Put it on the loudspeaker Brother Arabs! The Israeli aggression against Gaza... is an aggression against Bahrain The British aggression against Cairo is an aggression against Damascus The French aggression against Port Said Is an aggression against Algeria They want to break your hearts in Egypt And exterminate you everywhere -They dare to attack Egypt? To attack the heart of the Arab Nation? We'll teach them a lesson Quick, call together the officers Youssef, your plan is approved. At dawn you will receive an order setting the time. Djamila, why did you get up? Why? My uncle is dead Because it's like I almost killed him myself At that moment, my heart turned to stone Before killing my uncle, the French killed a million Algerians... Rest for a week to calm your nerves Youssef, don't ruin my life The struggle is my faith, my soul, my life Don't condemn me to live without faith, without a soul, without living If my feelings, my heart and my soul didn't belong to the country There's so much I would have told you. -I swear on God and Algeria... I will only be happy When my homeland is free Lord! You who are the only support Give me the strength to continue the struggle! You civilian operation will be held at the same time as our military operation: Sunday Here are your orders We have to go to the city, quickly Can I say goodbye to Hassiba? We'll wait for you by the rock We're going to the city. I promised to come see you before we left. Djamila, give him back the jewelry you've keeping for me And this ring too. -It's from Azzam. Keep it. There's no room in my hands for anything but weapons now Hassiba, Azzam is one of us! One of us? Tell him that I am too! After Youssef's explanation I have some good news for you... Tomorrow at noon, we'll receive the signal The cry "Allah Akbar" relayed from the mountain to the Kasbah Ammar, 5 other comrades and I, in Foreign Legion uniforms, Will take a truck to the Milk Bar Bouazza: at the same time, you'll go to the cafe About 100 meters from the Milk Bar And leave a time bomb there. Djamila, you cover Bouazza. Two minutes later, we'll be at the Milk Bar The bomb will explode at the cafe and all the police will go there. Clearing the way for us. We will kill all the men in the Milk Bar Who will be gathered there for Simone's birthday. Ah, the beautiful Simone! Azzam, you'll cover our escape from the Milk Bar, got it? Now let's get in disguise So... this good news? Hassiba is one of us. Hassiba! My Love! My Fiancée! --- There's Bigeard's office 50,000 francs for a kiss! No, no, not right now! There's Azzam's car Parked in front of the Milk Bar A glass of milk, please. Did you set the clock? -Once I've finished my drink. Isaac is there, he could get in the way We should exit through separate doors We have 30 seconds once the timer is set Miss! Miss! You forgot your bag Thank you, goodbye. You should have something to drink. -I have an important meeting If you forgot your bag you would have had to come back Just two minutes... We'll leave together. Two lemonades please. You forgot your meeting. -My friend, Djamila The lady is very nervous... Thank you. I'll clean this up Djamila, get out of here! -You'll find something in the toilet. My co-worker from the post office... The commandos blew up the cafe! Send the troops quick! Go get in the car Turn off your horn Only fire if we're unmasked Watch out! You're very busy, excuse me --- I know where Youssef's hideout is! They're holding a meeting I followed them after the cafe I'll leave you to your business I'll come back another time. Goodbye. Nothing but good news. The attack on Egypt failed. A hard lesson for France and England We marked a victory, And killed many officers. Come see... Bouazza did her duty, like Amina and many others I could have saved her! You did the impossible. Should you have been captured with her? A commando needs to know when to sacrifice themselves And when to keep living! Nothing is worse than imprisonment It would have been better if she had died That would have saved her so much suffering! You promised not to cry anymore. If I died or I was imprisoned... It wouldn't make you cry? And if I died or was imprisoned? --- Azzam, listen! He's one of us! My uncle? Judge Habib There's no time, get out of here fast Bigeard knows where you are ...It's the safest place And you? Do they know? -I don't think so. I'll go back to Bigeard's to slow them down. Hurry! God help you. How can we go out in the streets? Death is closing in on us from every side Take the important documents Djamila, I'll lead the way Youssef, have you forgotten? it's my most important task But I'm your commander. That's why you have to stay alive ...To command others after us. Your life does not belong to you. Abdel Kader needs you To push back these monsters --- --- A commando has to know when to sacrifice themselves And when to keep living. Is everyone ready? Be careful It would be a shame if the beautiful Djamila died Don't worry, you won't cry for me Order all soldiers to fire! The route is clear Halt! Youssef, let's go -And abandon Djamila? She sacrificed herself to save us --- The seal of the Liberation Front Dead? Watch out, she could commit suicide No one else was with her? Who was with you? Who was with you? Who was with you? Take her away! Why won't you talk? Why do you have this seal? You're one of the commandos SInce you admit it, tell us who was with you Tell us and you are free You won't free us... We'll free ourselves. Leave our country. You dare to talk back? You choose: Freedom or torture Right now I'm more free than you Don't threaten me any more, you groveller Me, a groveller? She must not be moved. You have to heal her so she can talk A political issue that has nothing to do with medicine Djamila, talk! Heal her! We've met somewhere before I don't remember where... I've lost my memory since I was arrested I have to interrogate you before you can be healed I'm different from the others I respect people who love their country. Then why do you stay with them? Miss, be nice to me and I will do the same for you... I know your kindness... Talk, and you will be treated with humanity and kindness Then you must not be French anymore Miss Djamila I want to help you. Didn't you admit that you are a commando? Why won't you tell us where Youssef is? Because I'm a commando. You're not making it easy for me. --- It would be better if you talk. You won't be bale to handle torture. Does it hurt? Does it hurt? Where is Youssef? Talk. It's true, I am weak But I have something with which I can bear all of your torture Something that will make me stronger than pain or death Something you don't know about Belief in liberty and dignity! Talk! Where is Youssef? You refuse to tell us where Youssef is? Where is Youssef? Tell us where Youssef is! Take her below. Officers against an Algerian woman! Our citizens will revolt! You deserve the Legion of Honour Mr. Lacoste, I will capture every last one of the commandos. Mr. Lacoste I know how to make her talk. Everything ready? What voltage? It can char her, if you want. I want to keep her alive so she can speak Did you see? I saw many things. Will you talk? You had better... Lord, you won't abandon me It would be better to talk. Where is Youssef? In Algeria. Listen. -Any news about Djamila? Djamila is alive, and is going to be transfered to Barberousse Prison Are you sure? -I heard it from Lacoste himself! Simone! Her neighbor Jean is a guard at Barberousse Could he be of use to us? -Why not? Let's go Jean, do you remember Djamila? -Djamila? Djamila who saved your daughter She's going to be transferred to Barberousse I pity her. Jean, could you take care of her? I'll try. I'm handing the prisoner over to you From the paratrooper camp. Put her in cell 1 Those are the orders. Djamila Bouhired Are you going to torture me too? Are you going to torture me too? Miss Djamila, don't be afraid of me Do you want me to bring a message to Simone? Tell her I am alive And that the voices of triumph Are my consolation and my hope What's she doing here? He wanted to interrogate me humanely Don't you know that provisions have been made for this prisoner? Djamila! God help you! Bouazza, they brought Djamila! Djamila Look, here's your brother. Djamila! Djamila, you're an Arab! Lord, give me strength. Give me the power to resist. Help me, my lord Youssef. -What is Jean doing? He can't do anything. He's sending his resignation to France He asked me to mail it. In the letter he protests against what's happening here. Jean has unknowingly done us a great service What he wrote is scandalous for France We will mail copies to Egypt and the other Arab countries The Voice of the Arabs will broadcast it It will raise the world opinion And we will save Djamila! The document signed by Jean On the boat there will be another person with the same mission as you One of you two must succeed. And will you go to the mountain? (Towards a return to peace in Algeria?) (Save Djamila!) --- --- --- Are you aware of Jean's resignation? Did you kill him? A great scandal for France! Algeria will gain the support of the entire world Thanks to Djamila Bouhired Let's get rid of her, make her disappear And turn her into a saint? We'll say she killed herself. No one will believe you. Then what should we do? -Give her a public trial Demonstrate French justice Prove that she was not tortured, accuse her of the worst crimes. I'll take care of organizing it. Read out the charges! Complicity in murders and attacks against people and buildings, Carrying explosives, and membership in a gang of assassins Are you a member of Youssef's gang? I am a member of the Liberation Front I do my duty as an Algerian I demand the assistance of a lawyer. I am your lawyer. -Who told you that. The court assigned him. -What objection do you have? This lawyer has been chosen by my opponents I'm waiting for another from Paris. The court cannot wait! As I do not recognize the designated lawyer The entire trial is null Isn't that what the law says? Do you know the law as well as us? I understand it as well as you, but not in the same way. Hang the criminal! Burn the criminal! Burn the infidel! The court directs the debate, not the criminal! Have you condemned me before even giving me a trial? Do not speak without authorization! Raise your hand! My hand is paralyzed from the torture You are bound by law to look into it All the medical reports refute torture. Ask me yourself: I was tortured, but the reports are more credible This is a sabotage of justice! Your justice is not worthy of the name, And you must remove the spectators The debate will continue regardless of the accused's attitude I protest against this judgment! You have deprived me of all my rights! Not just political rights, but even simple Human Rights! You can't prohibit me from speaking. Here we have equal rights. I will keep you quiet by force! You can't block the whole world's ears And you call this a judgment? Bring in the witness Bouazza, during the investigation you said That Djamila Bouhired killed French citizens Is that right? Answer, Bouazza. --- No, the soldiers didn't do anything to me The soldiers didn't do anything to me They didn't give me injections They didn't give me injections Does the defence have any questions? What do you mean no? In fact, Bouazza is a witness against you! For the most horrible crime in the history of humanity: Torture. Nobody has the right to torture another person Neither physically nor mentally! Do not speak! You have a lawyer. I do not recognize this lawyer. No one else will agree to defend you I am ready to defend her. Like anyone else with a love for justice and the law What right do you have to intervene? You know who I am, we were comrades. Master Jacques Verges, from Paris. I assume the defence of Djamila Bouhired In the place of my colleague who was arbitrarily designated. Down with the traitor! I think I might have had the wrong address This is certainly not a tribunal More like a jungle, where the wild beasts Are getting ready to devour their prey! This is an outrage to the court! And you have no mandate. For a mandate, all you have to do is ask the accused. This face that no longer has any glimmer of life But let her choose, she might take me for another enemy. Djamila Bouhired, do you accept me to assume your defence? --- The most eloquent of responses! My colleague can have a clear conscience I will defend the accused I would like to speak privately with the defendant Request denied. Consult the official report. It won't take more than 5 minutes. This is not a game of chess, You're judging a human being. If destiny put her fate in your hands You should understand the responsibility. I'll say what you want to know in front of them At the hospital they beat me while I was still bleeding! Do not speak without permission! Then they tore of my clothes And threatened me with Senegalese soldiers who rape Algerians You will be thrown out of the court if you continue these digressions Speak, you are in the sanctuary of justice! Nothing in the world can stop you from talking Speak, my child They put me in a cross, naked And directed electric currents at my ears, my, nose, my chest And other places... The defence wishes to question the witnesses Jean the prison guard from Barberousse And the doctors who made the reports Jean committed suicide Law and conscience committed suicide, more accurately Did the doctors kill themselves too? They can't make statements here ...Professional confidentiality! You wan't them to break the law? Are all crimes committed here in the name of the law? Designate another doctor to examine the defendant The defence has the right. We have enough reports. The law demands that you agree to my request And that you postpone the hearing. The hearing will be resumed tomorrow at 7 PM The final hearing... when the sentence will be declared Anything else? I ask the court to protect my life. I have no intention of committing suicide At least not before tomorrow Oh, excuse me -No, no, come in! Medical certificate attesting that Djamila... From Dr. Jeannine -You? No. -Who are you then? A messenger. Completing this mission while you... Djamila is not alone. I understand. Run him over and head for the office. Be careful. Dr. Jeannine was run over by a car. She is dead. Accidental death The same car that could have run over me You stifle every voice that defends the law We won't find any witnesses- They'll all die before they get here! --- --- --- There is a severe judgment in store for you We have written confessions. Read Djamila's confession. I didn't make any confession! The defendant must be protected from The barking of the audience. And the confession? I object to this confession! The defendant says she did not write it. We should submit it to a handwriting expert The confession is in the defendant's handwriting! Why have a trial if you have already decided to condemn her to death? You defy the law! -What law? The one that allows such a farce? This is an insult to the court martial! We don't have time to listen to your plea I request that the court- Get out! Out! Before leaving, I certify... That you have denied Djamila her human rights A fair investigation, A fair trial, And have deprived her of the right to defend herself! What you have done to Djamila is more than the English did to Joan of Arc! The defendant being guilty of all charges The court condemns her to death. You laugh? --- --- --- No my child, we should give her encouragement Djamila will never die, she will live in our hearts forever. Algeria, land of our ancestors We will free you from your chains Despite the enemy we will be sovereigns And exterminate the oppressors Algeria, land of our ancestors We will free you from your chains Despite the enemy we will be sovereigns And exterminate the oppressors Victims of the struggle, we swear an oath to you We will keep fighting until victory Comrades, be sure that victory Will bring a smile to our faces Algeria, land of our ancestors We will free you from your chains Despite the enemy, we will be sovereigns And exterminate the oppressors Salute to our mountains They are our ramparts They are where the holy war began And from there we will attack the intruders Algeria, land of our ancestors We will free you from your chains Despite the enemy, we will be sovereigns And exterminate the oppressors Stand up, courageous men, and shout Long live dignity, long live the mountain Long live our victims, long live the flag And long live the blood of the revolt! I know that you will condemn me to death My only crime is to love my homeland And hope for its liberty By condemning me to death, know that you condemn the principle of liberty As well as the honor and future of France Your sentence will not stop Algeria from gaining its independence And its place in the sun. subtitles by smold
