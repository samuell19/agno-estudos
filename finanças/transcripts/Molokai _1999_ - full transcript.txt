Go to the priest Father, Father... Here it is. Here... - Hello Father - Father, where is the girl? Here, we are working She has been declared a leper. I have a warrant for her. You would be tested again in Honolulu If she is clean, she will be released Here? Half the time they call it leprosy but it is not leprosy at all! When she is first examined. She had a spot on the right thigh yellowish purple... It's not there now. How long has this spot on your back been there? Well, she has got all the symptoms. Spots come and they go. She is losing feelings in her toes This one goes to Molokai. Next. More native have died of smallpox and typhus. This disease... no one knows how it is transmitted, there is no cure... It is communicated by sexual contact. And it is God's retribution for the licentiousness of their ways. Exactly. I have been listening to confessions for 20 years, I have been shocked, breathlessness when I heard what an 18 year old boy had said. If it is communicated by sexual contact, how is it children become afflicted? Well, they inherited! I have consulted the highest medical authority and he said it's the fourth stage of syphilis Nonsense! The bacillus has been isolated... Gentlemen, Gentlemen! Let's at least agree it is a scourge. And those who have it must be isolated. And while I am Prime Minister we will not fail in this, or... Hawaii will become a nation of Lepers. But as long as you isolate them and keep them in a place where they have no relatives. A place which will turn into a living hell... with no law. That's why I have called you together We cannot send police to that island. Why not? I've tried. They had resigned. Fear of disease. They can't take their families, It's hopeless. They won't go. They won't do it. Then the natives will continue to hide their sick... And I for one, don't blame them. Exactly. As missionaries, We have given our lives to spread the word of the first Good Shepherd Of those we have converted, a few who had be condemned to that colony of terror and death on Molokai. To die there, without confession or the last rites painful to them and the dreadful danger to their immortal souls I've been reluctant, to send any of you to such a dangerous place But when we finished our meeting with the Prime Minister He left us with these words. "If a noble Christian, priest, preacher or sister should be inspired to sacrifice his life to console these poor wretches, that would be a royal soul, to shine forever on the throne raised by human love... It has moved me to ask, if any of you might have the wish to volunteer. Well since there are four of you, you will each serve three months That will provide them with a Priest throughout the year. Now, the honor of establishing the Parish... will fall to... you... Father Damien We have a small church there. It needs some repairs. It's all right, Your Grace. As a young boy in Flanders, I often slept in the stables. Don't forget, you are not to touch any patient. And eat nothing that you haven't prepared yourself. Are you ready, Father? God be with you, son. I'll have you back in Honolulu within a month, I promise. Now remember... don't touch anyone! Welcome, Father. What is that brought you to Molokai? You have the disease? No. No. I have come to establish a parish. Well, You've got a deposit full of souls to save. Have you got your things among these crates? No. No, I come as I am. Make sense. Only a fool will choose to come. Come on, I'll take you the settlement. See that cliff? The Paâ€œ, you mean'? Yes, but there is only one trail up there... steep enough to make a mule giddy. Most patients couldn't make it, if they try. But if they succeeded, they would be shot if they're caught. Shot? That's the law. No patient leaves this island except in a coffin. The sea is worse here than in other islands The good part is, it keeps anyone from trying to escape. The bad part is that you are supposed to get supplies every month. But you are lucky if boats get in here every two months. I manage a cavalry ranch at the top. So they asked me to "administer" here. How often do you come down? I try to get down with a couple of my men when the boats come in so the food isn't stolen right from the start. Kahoohuli... Say Aloha to a Priest He has come to save souls. Aloha Aloha... Kahoohuli is the store keeper and my number one man here. He gives out the rations. So we know it at least starts out fair. If the priest, is still here tomorrow you lent him a horse and give him some rations. I don't know, if you smoke, or not... but I advise you to try a pipe. You find the very sick ones have a smell from their open sours. If you smoke a pipe, It doesn't bother much. Bless you. From now on, only God can help you. Yes, I often count on Him Dear Lord. You died at age 33. I begin my life at 33 I pray for your protection Hello, Priest. I saw you come. Hello Hello You're English? Yes. I was a Medical assistant in Honolulu When I got this blasted disease, myself A lesson to you Can I move you into the Church? No. I like the sight of the sea. I will not have it long May I give you the sacraments? Pity? from a Catholic priest? My father would rise from his grave Ah, Father. Do not feel insulted Come back tomorrow. I maybe frightened enough, to think about it. May the God be with you. And with you too. Just now, you need him more than I. In the name of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit Amen Father. Hello. Could I be your altar boy? In my village I was one. Ah, that would be a wonderful help I wouldn't have to touch the Chalice or anything. No... No... Shall I come tomorrow? Yeah... Wait Let us agree formally Father... Hello Father... can you help us? Emma, my youngest daughter, she came to take care of me when they allowed families to come, Now, a Portuguese has taken her to the mad house. He makes her do bad things. I am too sick I need her. Did she go with him, because she wanted? No, No... She fought, but it's no good to fight. He always win. Emma? Emma? Emma. Emma! Emma. Emma! I want Emma to stand Emma! Come, you should come with me. You take your hands away from her. Wait... Mululani, What are you doing here? With the approval of the Superintendent. We are turning this building into a dormitory for the sick and for the elderly How long do you think, you will last priest Let us live while we can, nobody cares! Yeah? Yes, If I cares. And God cares. And this is not the way to live. Come. Bring Jimi! I cannot know your pain, except in my heart. There is a God. I know that... If you believe in Him, You feel him. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, Amen. My Brothers and Sisters in Christ, My fellow Lepers, We have met here in the presence of God, to seek His solace. To be reminded of his love for us to relive through the Mass the sacrifice of his son on the cross so that we might one day behold, in the life to come. I do not have the disease that they send you to Molokai. But I want to remind you that all men, know loneliness. All men know isolation, despair, All men are afflicted in their hearts or .. on... their bodies with sores and wounds which make them, outcast. Outcast to... whom... In his life on earth, He healed the blind, He healed the lepers, Not to tell us that men will not be blind... or men, would not be lepers, but to tell us that in His eyes the blind people could see, the lepers were clean. And He loved them... as He loves all mankind. On that cross, then as now. He shares all of our agonies And by following in his Light He will show us all the way to peace. Your Grace, I... I'm sorry, this is outrageous He is now demanding timber and nails. He says that he is not going to sleep under a roof not until there is adequate cover for all the patients There is another article about him in the paper today. The Prime Minister calls him a "Christian Hero". "A healthy young man who has sacrificed himself for the dying inhabitants of Molokai" Yes, thank you. And does he speak of returning? No, No... on the contrary. This settlement, needs a resident priest. Boat loads of sick arrived... many are dying "| want to stay " And he also boasts of baptising 20 converts. Well, All things considered, I think we must grand him his wish. Write to him, Tell him he may remain, until further notice. Oh, and caution him again about touching anybody. Oh, Damien! Look at all this I brought, More than I ever got out of the Government oh,I have a Bishop with a conscience. As a good Lutheran, I have got no faith in Bishops. What are you doing? I am... making a wind break. We have winds in Beligum too. They picked the worst hole in Hawaii Because of the cliff, you never see the sunrise. Never seen it set. The were put in away with murderers They couldn't thought of a better place. Here, this came with the ship Kahoohuli says you two of you have been breaking up some rules Yes, We made some enemies. I don't like, the stealing of food, I don't like, them forcing girls into prostitution, But these people are on a death sentence... with nothing to do, but think about it... and they are sick on top of it. So I don't think that a little liquor hurts. Drunkenness does not help anyone. Only the grim reaper is going to help your flock father, Father. Well, we differ. Bad news? Yes, I asked for nuns, Nursing nuns. Our Provincial Father Eleanor, It says Concluded that I'm both insane and arrogant. You're a good man, Damien, but you better learn to bend. like those trees. The ones that don't bend, breaks. If there is not enough food, why don't the people plant crops? The sick cannot. The Strong? It is easier to pick from the sick. To plant, you must believe, you're strong enough to harvest. Who knows? Yeah, but you are planting. I plant, because you plant. Well, little bishop, you're late again. Yes, Father. I was showing the boys how to plant yesterday. I thought you would come. Little Bishop, come. Hmm... no.. no... You're not going back, to that man! No, it was my fault... No, you're not going back. " Please, Father... I have to. He takes care of me. What do you want, Priest? Hey, come, come, come here.. I haven't told anything... not even in the confessional. All I feel is the devil's sours. And my feet, I feel nothing. And my fingers... see it burns like hell. You should be in the hospital. A hospital... where there is no beds? We can clean your sores we can bandage them properly... I am not a Catholic, and I will never be a Catholic! Yeah, How you live must be your choice, But if you beat that boy once more... Yeah? I say once more, you will need a Hospital such as this island does not possess. You understand? Hey! Hey! You understand? I want to hear you say that? All right... All right. I'll see you at Mass tomorrow, Yeah? You be on time. Yeah... You should be more comfortable. All this work for a Protestant? You might go to Hell. I would rather got you took the sacrament but... I don't like you sleeping like this within my sight. I suppose that it would be easier theologically if I just die. Oh, you can't die, until I convert you. Do you honestly believe that only Catholics go to Heaven? I'm not absolutely certain. But, I know that Catholics, can go to Heaven. You know You shouldn't touch lepers... not less, eat with them. I know a man who bandaged lepers open wounds, and he's going to teach me, how. He's not in the greatest of health? Oh yes, But his spirit seems to be. Yes, as for me, I dread it. But I put my health in hands of God and the blessed Virgin They will protect me as long as I need it. What are the reasons that made you a missionary? My sister, I was the youngest boy, and my sister she protected me until I could protect myself. I loved her very much, and she became a nun, and died, taking care of the sick during the typhus epidemic. So you were born a missionary, No... No, not quite, I was not smart enough Yes, I had to work very hard To pass... Latin and Theology... Oh, well... Those are, of course the most important things Oh, yeah... come... The Blessed Virgin, may save you from Leprosy. I'm sure, she will save you from influenza? I will take the chance. Now can I move you into the Church? No. No... when it comes, I want to die here. Up there, at night I see the world I have missed, and all the friends and family who forgotten that I still breathe. I can tell you, no one in these islands have greater respect for him than I do... but these reports, these reports are grossly unfair to the government. I understand your feelings, Sir. But it does seem that the provisions for the patients are some what less than might be desired. My dear Bishop... half of every dollar that the board of health spends go to that colony, I... I'm sorry, I didn't understand... It was assumed that they would grow their own food Now that they have simply refused! The cost of transport, arresting them, providing daily food and many more thing... it is absolutely troubling Your Grace, Father Damien Ah, Damien! I would like you to meet the Prime Minister. Hello! Excuse me, so we very much need clothing for the children About... two hundred outfits. Damien! Sorry to be so blunt, but writing, seems to produce nothing. And this is an opportunity that I would not likely have ever again. Father Damien currently you wrote a letter to your brother in Paris, Ah, yes sir... Furthermore, your brother has in fact published it. And now the newspapers in Paris and London have picked it up and expanded the riot But I was simply telling you... but you gave the impression Damien that you alone who felt concerned. For these poor unfortunatess No, no. I meant nothing like that. Now, this has been a serious embarrassment for the government, all this publicity. But, Why are you here in Honolulu? I had to make my confession. That colony is under Quarantine! I admire what you have done, too... For that reason, I am prepared to give you a permit, to go back, but under this condition, that you may never leave again But... but I am not infected. How might I be able, to make my confession? Well, that's something between you and their superiors. You don't have to go back. You are young, Healthy No one would blame you. Sorry, I am needed there. Then you know the terms!. Thank you, gentlemen! And from now on, Father. You will send all correspondence to me, there will be no more publishable letters. Father Damien sent me. As you hear, He is busy Shall I feed you? That would be a luxury. Father Damien wants you to go to the hospital. No thanks, I've been... He worries that you're to ill to fend for yourself Wait a minute. They are close to doing it well this time Did he ask for me? No. Ah... Father Damien It's time for me to leave you... No... you're only weak, take some food. I have lived in pain for months, now I feel nothing And you want to take it away with with a mouthful of porridge? I need someone to talk to. You can't leave me now. Sorry, Father I have another appointment. Sometimes I pray... Sometimes I beg... sometimes I thunder with fury... at the danger of you going to God without your sin forgiven. You must realize the danger. I want you to ask for Absolution. Do you want my last act in life, to be false? No... I want the truth. I beg you, let me give you the last rights. You are stubborn, Damien. But... I am the one who got away. Don't worry, I will say a good word for you, on the other side. When a white man treats them well, they don't forget. Who paid for the coffin? I made it from the timber, for church repairs. And you burying him, in the Catholic graveyard? He lived in the graveyard, He can also be put to rest in it. Nearer, O God, to thee. Hello! Hello! Damien... you're to blame for this! If you were not here, I never would have dared. Oh, You don't know how much I longed to talk to someone from the mainland. Well, I can't say that I was anxious to come, But here I am, a Resident Physician. I am very glad, and how is your family? They're fine. Let him go, Ute! Stop! What are you doing? He was a part of the ship. A sailor who kidnapped islanders for slave labour on the plantations. I brought a good case of German Beer Oh, and I fixed you a house, which is by the sea. Yes? well, report, Plasco whomever you! Now scram! Get out! Old fool! You cannot do this! We are workers! The government gave this barrack to us! The government, is not interested shit, you, on a shit island like this! What you got there? I'll take that! - This is mine! This is mine! - Now get out! Come on, get out! Did you know that dying, didn't say necessary that, I want to be a doctor. If I had met Damien then probably would turn into a priest. Ah, another Catholic? Ha, ha... Congregationalist. Oh, You must must walk carefully Father Damien, sees a Protestant, is like a lumberjack, seeing a big redwood tree. Oh, you have to heal the spirit, if you want to heal the body. You think the spirit can cure leprosy? Oh, Christ did. Oh, Christ... but you or me? Oh, no, no... Not without a Miracle but I think that God can protect you, if he so chooses. Well, I have not brought a miracle. But there is a new medicine from China catted Huang Nan. Now a Dominican priest tried it in Trinidad, and claims great success. I came, because it's my hope we can try it here. And duplicate it's results. How much of this stuff did you bring? Well, we have received only a small shipment, and I left some in Honolulu for analysis. Could we start with the young? Sure, why not? Some adults, of course, and ah... some of the most severe cases... and we need to try on some of those who have just come. And if there is a miracle, er... would you mind that I say, that it comes from God? If it's is a miracle, I promise you... even I will thank God. Hello! Aloha! Aloha. I've scored two goals. Ah, that is quite some team. Leho! Gihil! Leho! Gihil! Come! This is Dr. Kalewis, he has some new medicine to try. It's just a powder mixed with honey. Taste good Half a spoon each. Please... you give it to them. Gihil!... good. Leho... here, come, come. Leho... Ah, yes... it's very delicious. I have to make you sweep the floor to get it. Good boy. So... It's, okay and score a goal, please. We have to give them another dose, in three days. Yes? To whom they belong to? Oh, Like most children here... no one. Sometimes they watch for a while and I can lure them in. Sometimes I only get close to them only when they are dying. I've managed to build some small huts for housing, but we very much need an orphanage, and nuns to take care of them God bless you, Try this out. Thank you Father, God bless you. Pray that it works, right? Thank you. Oh... Thank you... No beds? No. There are some beds at the hospital in the other end of the island but the Board of Health, won't let us move them. I need some air. If I had enough wood, I could build them myself. You'll get used to it. Hello Kulier. Not one of the carers get paid? Only if that, it keeps you from boredom And that... that's the worst punishment on the island Yes I could hook them, it lasts for a time. But once in a while they go off, to drink... or to be with a man, which warded away partly, desperation. Some are fairly well off. Oh, yes, some family send money and clothing, but... to admit, there is leprosy in the family means that they cannot marry of their sons, sometimes even their daughters, so they are forgotten. Come. The rich ones here, can pay for the timber, and they get the Chinese people to build their homes. Then when they are too sick, the gangs come in, and they steal everything. And when they die, another rich one comes in, and the buy the house from the relatives, and it starts all over again. Here's one I would like to try the medicine on. Hello... Hello... I have some good news for you... I... I think it's better that we look for another patient. May God bless you. My God! Inhale deeply, several quick ones. This is the dying shed. When they reach this stage, they feel very desolate. In the morning We take away the dead. My God, what a way to die! And we bring them food and at night I will say my Rosary here. I think the company helps, and all the prayers, too. Dear God, your love is eternal. Do not forsake the work of your hands, but... welcome this child in Heaven. She died? Yes. Yes, during the night. I make her a casket. I took her to the church. That music, what is it? Hula! That is hula. It is the sacred dance... They, they beg the gods to relieve those who are suffering through a spell. I cannot stay, Damien. I thought I could, but... I want to marry. I was told that there's women here. I thought I could bring a wife. She would go crazy at the end the first day. I'll leave you the medicine. And I promise to return periodically. But I cannot live here. Well, I will miss you. Is there anything I can do? Yes, yes, I long to make a confession. And you say, How we need nuns. Nuns. Nuns... that. that, mean so much to, to the hospital... and to the children. I'll speak to the Bishop and the Board of Health. You are the miracle God gave these people. Damien. We mourn the loss of your servant, Mulliya, whose life passed so quickly, Welcome him into your kingdom, where there will be no sorrow. No weeping, no pain. We ask you this through Christ our Lord, Amen I thought that you were saving that spot for yourself. I'll be close to her. You plan to stay here till you die, Father? Yeah, well everyone else does. I am afraid that our Doctor is leaving. Yeah, I know. Kahoohuli is getting worse. I had to put someone else in charge. This is Clayton Strawn. He's in good health. He knows how to run things. And to be honest, My brother have been, making the law than breaking it. Can I come in? Yeah... What is it? I saw you going past. And you looked... lonely. I thought I should come and visit you. I am, I'm saying my prayers Malulani. Me, I'm perfectly happy- Why are you so shy? But you're strong... like our men. I think... I think you should go home now. I like you very much, you're a good man. Now you, You must go home. Please go... I beg you. You're destroying my whole life. Please go... I mean it! I want you to go! Your Grace... I have written to every priest on the islands. No one will go. Order them to go! I have, but all of them have excuses. Influenza, Dying parishioners. Broken foot. Diarrhea. Suspected smallpox. They just won't go. He has the right to make confession! If no one else will go... Then I must go. Your Grace, if you set foot on that island they will never let you off again. I am a bishop and I am going! Make the arrangements, Father Leonor. Oh, Captain! Would you please instruct your crew to lower a boat? And put me ashore? You don't have a landing permit, father, so I am not going to do that. I am a Bishop of the Catholic Church. With all due respect Sir, I am obeying the orders of the Board of Health. Then I must ask you, to allow Father Damien on board If that priest so much as touches this boat will direct my men to fire on him. I'm protecting my crew and passengers It's no use, they won't allow you on board! Yes, I know, I've tried. Your Grace, I need desperately to make my confession I know, my son. Can I speak it to you here in French? Of course! Yes! Yes! Begin! Begin! In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Damien... Damien... don't storm heaven so violently, my son. Allow yourself the charity that you would allow others. Continue, continue... "Leper's priest, forced to confess at sea " That paper sold out, they had to print another edition. Sir, the King and Princess Liliuokalani... demanded... your immediate presence in the Palace. God! It's we who maintain this pretentious "monarchy"? Because if we didn't, Americans, would take over in twenty-four hours. Do you know, Evans... what time you stayed in the office is second to none! Oh! Thank you, Sir. And, Sir... Princess Liliuokalani has told the press that quarantine or no that she is going to visit the colony on Molokai. Is it not ironic, Evans? I was the first one to call him a "Christian Hero". Aloha Princess... Yes, it's not... not much, but it is an improvement. They must have beds! Yeah... I want it to be understood in Honolulu, they must have beds. Yes, your Highness. This Chinese medicine, It doesn't work. I know, it is, It is merely mostly arsenic which does slows the disease, for a short time but that's all. My people are dying, Father Damien... Typhus, Smallpox and now this. We are a happy people. But sometimes, I feel... I feel that our tears could fill an ocean I am only here, for a short time. But I want you to tell me what is that you need. We need houses. We need more medicine. We need something for pain. What is it you'd like? I wish that my mother was here. And you, little girl, what is that you would like? I wish... I wish that you can make us better. Until we meet again. Aloha. Aloha! I brought you some company. Hymaha, please show the visitors the way to the house. Come with me... He is always building in pieces, never one thing at a time. You are so young, that's all we've heard. I just looks so. I think it's all because of the beer he drinks. We thought that you were receiving a flood of donations. No... No. It... It's work on the old pattern of Church and State. The church says it gets money from the government so that... we don't need donations. The government says that we gets money from donations. So we don't get money from them. So that is your greatest worry, hmm? Money? No... no. at this very moment My worst problem is that the voice of authority, is a drunkard and a thief and I have to fight with him all the time. The harmonium, was a gift from Princess Liliuokalani. Dislea is right hand, Kinar is left. Bishop! Little bishop! Before you continue, we have some guests. We have Mr Clifford... Doctor Saxe, and some of you know, Dr. Kalewis. Aloha. Please continue. As you can see... I've seen some of this on my patients. They comes and it's go. My dear Damien... it's is Scabies. Sometime during the day, you have to make time to go to the river and wash it off. There is another, one on the foot. Do you mind? Would you have a nail? Yeah... Yes, here. Is it numb? Let me know when it hurts? Ouch! . I thank you for the years that You have given me. Our first Belgium beer. You are almost old enough, to drink this, little bishop. But don't let me catch you, taking this before... Oh! Oh, my God, I forgot! Come, Come, Come! Mayor was sending... sending down candles. If we don't get there soon, Strawn, will take half of it for himself! Please... Follow me, Bishop. Come... Yes, I have come for the candles you've stolen! They are not your candles, You are not the owner of the damn candles! Yes, I'll take the children too! Why do you want the damned children! They are here to die... like the rest of us. Let them do, what they want! Yeah, well, what they want is not to be afraid of adults, who are crazy with drink, and anger and despair Malulani... Ah, leave her here! She is not interested in your singing and praying. Take the children and get out! I have the right... to the good life. The good life was when you help the sick people. When you made the children laugh. You held them when they were afraid, Look at this. This is the medal of a Knight Commander of the Royal Order of Kalakaua. That is what Father Damien is been made. Father Damien we're all very proud of you. Why is he eating by himself? Because Father Damien, has got Leprosy. And I want you to remind you that a man is judged by what is in him. Many patients I have known, puts some of the handsome men at this table to shame. What will happen to the orphans? Oh, I won't die tomorrow Elizabeth. You had to be at the harbor. Yes sir, I did, but the harbor got very rough And the ship captain, would not put out any of the boats What is the point, man? Go to the point! The captain says he will toss the lepers all into the sea! He won't take them to the next port. Damien, you can't go down the cliff with that leg! Damien, don't be a fool! Be careful! Go down slowly... Go down slowly... or you'll break your neck! Damien, take it easy! I want to die... Help! Bastards! Help! Help! Bring a blanket! Some have washed up on the shore dead. Many are missing. Please God Please, God... Please listen to me, God... She's dead. Sir... Sir. There are two gentlemen here to see you. I thought I had made it clear I would see only one representative! Yes, sir. Prime Minister, do you realize that they're talking about ten years of fighting? I have taken measures already. As of today, Captains will be responsible for the lives of all those on board. That is not enough! More than that, we will make an announcement. A new hospital for Lepers, here in Honolulu. Are you closing Molokai? Now, look! Just the word of a new Hospital calm things down for a few months, all this will be forgotten. Now, thanks for your concern Good day. Evans? This is something that I rather not do again. Don't move, I trusted her. She knows every step by heart. I don't think we like each other. I am Father Damien, I am a leper. I know. I am the Brother Joseph Dutton. Here to do, What ever you wanted me to do. Oh, that sounds too good. Don't worry, I have my eccentricities. Why don't you ride? I don't mind. Oh, no, that's good for me. I am not giving it up. Bishop's letter, tell you who sent me here? No... no, Bishop's letter only said that you are a penitent. And that if I showed you too much gratitude, that I must sabotage your wish to suffer. Well, from what I read your colony will offer even me all the penance I need. It was Professor Clifford who sent me here.. I read his book. Oh... he has written a book on Molokai? Yes, about you. I am going to be your Action Coordinator, Father. I read about your disorder and lack of cleanliness. Oh, he wrote that? Clifford wrote that? I would say that described the situation. Now don't worry, he said one or two nice things about you. So I have some... some proper cooking utensils You're in the Army? Yes. During the war? Yeah. I understand that you lost a friend when they forced Bishop Maigret to take early retirement. Yes... Bishop Kockerman, who claims to respect you, gave me two bits of information. One you will like, One you may not, Begin with the one I may not. Well, they're rebuilding a hospital for leprosy patients outside Honolulu. Now, that will take lot of the money that you've hoped for yourself I hoped that, I didn't really expect. And the good news? A Mother Marianne from Syracuse, New York, read about the Harbor incident and is bringing six sisters to Hawaii. Oh, My God! You don't know how much I prayed for that. Mother. Prime Minister. Father. I should have come a little earlier. My nuns are going to Molokai. I will go too. I have got nuns here and take those who choose to go with me. But surely, you realize that once you set foot on that island, no one would be allowed, to see you. Nor will you'll be free ever to come back, That will haunt my conscience, if I don't go and help those of who are sick and without family... and who cannot come back Mother Marianne, must recognize Father Damien who exaggerates. Those people are not without care. If only our other parishes have received one tenth what he has. And he receives government funding. Think of the good that you are doing here. It would be monstrous to give up all this for some hopeless cause Attending to sick and dying is not a hopeless cause. You are attending to the sick and dying here. That settlement, is in my charge. For your own good, I will not allow you to go! In the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost, Bless me Father, for I have sinned. Put your trust in God. How long has it been from your last confession? Too long. There are too many sins to remember. The agony of Christ on the Cross, will take the burden of sin... from your soul. I'm blind, Father. I'm blind and helpless. In this world there are many people who have eyes but... still cannot see, Maybe he will let you find your way in the dark. We've read Professor Clifford glorious accounts of your many wonders It seems you are Doctor, Magistrate, School teacher, Carpenter, Farmer even Gravedigger. Since you're apparently doing the work of twelve men, it seems hardly surprisingly that I have received a notice from a Belgian newspaper announcing your death. Yes, we've received a number of donations but we have expenses here. I will try to pay twenty-five dollars... for your expenses there, next month. I thank you very much for passing on the news of my death. May I recommend, that the head stone reads, "Here lies, the Leper Priest, who seldom made his confession. " Oh, Brother Dutton reports that hundreds of dollars have come from America alone. I need, seventy-nine dollars forty-three cents for the lumber for the Hospital. I would supply the labor Free. In one of my many manifestations. Yours in Christ, Damien. We have been shocked... to discover that one thousand pounds has been transferred from England for use as you wish to prescribe. Prime Minister and Mother Marianne are meeting at the very moment to discuss the matter. A certain Dr. Saxe, and the Prince of Wales are involved. No doubt with your provocation. If I've counted too much on your humility... I am to be blamed. But as your Provincial, I remember your vow of poverty. It has been reported, that you are installing Japanese baths... in the Sisters Hospital. Since the government continues to send all the advanced cases to Molokai and we don't even have fresh water supply. I am relucant to defy, the Prince of Wales directions. My boys need a stove, My girls need clothes. I fear, that my end is near and I am coming to Honolulu for confession. As your bishop, it is my duty, My dear Father, To advice you not to come to Honolulu, People would be afraid to deal with us and you could not say Mass, We will never use, the same chalice and vestments again. Could I add something Your Grace? I would like to add, "Do try to have more consideration for others". Is everything all right? No. No... I'm all right, Joseph. God does not answer me. Why do you say that, Father? You know better than I, God never forsake anyone. I have atoned for every thing, but for almost one week... I have been unable to pray... I prayed to God, to speak to me... but he is silent. He is not silent, Father. He is just waiting. It's good to see you. Yes... After lunch, Dr. Trousseau like to examine you. Oh, please, please... no. you mustnâ€™t fuss... The baths have made me feel ten years younger. Give us three more days and you'll be running the Mass. I leave you to eat. Yes. It would be wonderful to have bathrooms on Molokai. And the sisters to administrator them. We have much to do here, Father Damien. Yes, but here you have four doctors and seven nuns and one hundred patients, none of them dying. On Molokai, we have no doctors and no nuns. And one thousand patients, and all of them dying, and soon be, even without a priest. Damien, you're my cross, this is embarrassing. We weighed this question for long time now. You cannot sent nuns to Molokai. It's amazing. When I ask for money, Molokai is a Paradise, You have lost your humility, Damien. I shall mention it in confession. I don't understand Yes, I have sores on my... face and my neck and some on my hands and my feet but I can assure you, I have none on my body. Dr. Trousseau still believes that Leprosy is the fourth stage of syphilis. There have been rumors, Damien. Your house, apparently, is open to everyone, Men and Women. I have kept my vow of chastity. I have never been with a woman. Or a man, if that matters to you. Your bishop has given me permission to examine you. Please stand up and lift your cassock. If he have the second stage of syphilis, he would had to have, at least one sore. It is important to check. Check! We cannot rely, on patients words. You may pull up your trousers, Father. Aloha Father Damien. I am honored to meet you. Oh, this is my honor your Majesty. So good to see you. Yes... I hope you could stay and have some rest. No, I hope to return as soon as possible. The baths and the treatment have helped very much. I wish this was something that people of Molokai could experience. Well, this would obviously be very expensive. Perhaps the new nurse's residence, here could be delayed. Well, that's... possible, In fact, uh, definitely, it could be done. I was just telling Your Highness that it would be wonderful to have nuns on Molokai. Well, that, that has always been our intention, nuns, to Molokai. Certainly has been. And Sister Leopoldina has been telling me... that a Priest from Belgium... has arrived to work in the settlement. Unfortunately, he is not of our Order. And it takes a year... Yes, I don't think I'll last a year. But there are exemptions, are they not? Or perhaps you could come until he is ready... Father Leonor? I spent about fifteen years in Indian territory in Oregon, where I was almost scalped once, but I still made a few, Christians. And I was waiting for years to come over. I was praying- Strawn wants to see you. Oh... May I come? Yes, yes, come. Thank you. Celia and I have lived together for two years. When she was sent here, her husband divorced her. I don't have much time left in this world, I know that in her heart, we are man and wife, in my heart, too. We want to get married. To be together, true man and wife. Is your husband still alive, Celia? I don't know. I am sorry Strawn... it is a sacrament. That is right... it is a sacrament! It is a sacrament! Don't feel guilty. Eleanor, probably would have unfrocked you if you had agreed to marry them. Celia, is she even a Catholic? I seen her at Mass with Strawn. Yeah, I bet you have seen them in the Village of Fools, too! Yes, but they get their solace from their old Gods. Before, I used to rant against them, but I think it gives them some peace. All the instruments, they were donated by the King. How many patients are Catholics? There are one thousand people on the island... Six hundred of them are now Catholic. Jesus" But what he describes... You must understand, that he exaggerates. In my conscience, I cannot stay here and do nothing. Prime Minister, I have vows to fulfill. Think of the good that you're doing here. You may kiss the bride. I hope you are not going to be sorry for doing this. By the time Lenor finds out... both Strawn and I will be gone. Father Damien... How did you know it was me? Your walk. Because you do not sleep, eh? The wind... Oh... music in the trees. Are the nuns really coming? Well, there were some difficulties. It takes a month to get from New York to Honolulu. Then five years to get from Honolulu to Molokai. But... they're coming. Do not be afraid. I'll stay here until you go to sleep, okay? What are you doing? You're sick. Hey, did the nuns arrive? Oh yes, the nuns arrived. Now here is the really good news. You're not allowed to see them. You're banned from the Chapel and the Residence. And for God's sake, Come down, We're almost done, Benedictus... Help me We have come to take care of Father Damien. Brother Dutton, would you get us some warm water, please? We would like to bathe him now. You're not supposed to be be here. He has influenza. We will be careful. We have dealt with influenza before. Father Damien... I am Sorry, that it has took us so long. I have been told such stories. We couldn't get permission to come. I truly didn't know. I beg for your forgiveness, and for your blessing. It mean so much to us. Yes, my... my greatest wish was, that you would come. Now... now you have. May God bless you, and keep you, Help me It's time for your medicine. No... no more. My little home, now has a young priest, nuns, a brother. It's time for me, to rest. And I... I am looking forward, to reaching there, in Heaven. And I... I will pray for all of you. Father Damien... is gone. But, He will live for us forever.
