We met in the military. He's very fat, you see. We went to see a movie together. The theater was cramp. This girl next to him told him to stop pushing her. Sorry. So he said, "It wasn't me.

It was fishy from the beginning. That damn bakery owner! What? What? The Guitar! Take your chicken wings They're feathers! GUITAR FOR SALE I'll be back. There's nothing written here. On the back. How much did you say to sell it for? $700. Don't you think it's too cheap? Do we have to sell it? 누군 팔고싶어서 파냐? I'd rather sell you instead! I'll be back. - Welcome. - Hello.

So you left the house. And then the bus station. No. I walked. All the way to Hongik University? Yup. I gave you the fare. So you walked instead? You walked all the way there? Then where did the guitar go? Strange... Did I take the bus? I'm dumb to trust you with that! Give me my guitar, you lunatic! The bakery! What bakery? You ate bread by yourself? I ate the bread. But not the guitar! I held the bread in this hand, and the milk in the other... No, the milk was... You drank milk, too? No, that wasn't it. I put the bread here and the milk here What about the guitar? I put the bread here, and stood the guitar there. Ah, and then I drank the milk. Was it with this hand? Wait... - Sir. - Yes? That guy... He left a guitar here while eating some bread. Did you happen to see the guitar? Guitar? No, I didn't see it. You see, the guitar was in a black leather bag. I didn't see it. Look, I won't get mad at you. Where did you leave it? Everyone makes mistakes. It's not your fault. - But... -But what? I think I saw the guitar. Where? In that bakery. Why are you telling me that now? You promised not to get mad! But I believed the owner! Have you ever seen a criminal admit his crime? Are you sure? That bastard... Those kids are following us! Mister. Wait. Don't come any closer! It's hot! It's hot! Stay back! Don't accuse me of stealing the guitar! I have to open the door! Let's talk this through. You damn kids! Hey, mister! Damn it! Let go of me! What's wrong with all of you? What's with this place? The owner and the staff are all the same. Let go. What are you doing? That belongs to me! What's wrong with you, mister? Mister? Go away! Let go of this! It belongs to me! No, it's mine! You call yourselves musicians? How could you handle the guitar like that? With that kind of attitude, that's why music sucks lately! So what? What? So what? What? Have you helped us write a note at least? We're not selling the guitar because we want to! Hey. That's a 501J, right? A Nano 012 goes well with it. Nano 012? That's really expensive. They don't make that anymore. I have that string with me. Forget it. Eat as much bread as you want while I change the string. You go have some bread, too. Isn't that "Remembrance" by Sanulim? This song was originally mine. Are you kidding me? That's their song. Don't be ridiculous. Only if I had registered this song... I wouldn't be here like this. This is my album. Mister! Wow! Look at the second track. Second one is "Remembrance". The third is "The Day She First Cried"? Kwang-suk and I sang that song a lot. The famous singer, KIM Kwang-suk? Did you know him? Wow, that's cool. Let's shake hands. Kwang-suk used a lot of my songs. I should've gotten a lot of royalty. Whatever. Just give me the guitar, Bakery Man. Hold on! I walked on the street When I felt someone beside me I realized it then Already after she had left me I was walking alone Suddenly the wind feels cold Oh, the girl who left me Oh, I miss her Oh, she turned away Oh, I miss her I didn't ask her Why she had left me But my heart was so broken She already turned away I couldn't do anything It was me who missed her That's strange. Where did you buy this? At the Nakwon Market? It feels like my old guitar. What are you talking about? Drop by if you need a song. Can I come for bread, too? You need to be hungry in order to create music. Do you know how "Remembrance" came out? When I got kicked out of my place... Stop regretting over the guitar. Hey! You guys are musicians, aren't you? - No. - Yes. Shall I teach you the drums? You think he was serious about composing those songs? Hey! Can't we just keep the guitar? Damn it. Go sleep in your room. (CD for $10) Damn it! What are you doing? I'm spinning the globe. What? When I spin the globe, the world goes around better. Come spin it with me. Then the world will go around well. Whenever I dream, it's the same dream That's how I get used to it I live believing it's the right answer Like watching a rerun as on a recorded tape Everything resembles one color Why, why do you keep wanting the same answer Why, why do you keep telling me to live the same way High, high flying up high High, high looking at the world What I saw won't be everything High, high running up high High, high running to the world The time that has passed is jut a part of my long life A car is square and a banana is yellow Always with the same perception Men wear pants Women wear skirts Always being like the usual way Why, why do you keep wanting the same answer Why, why do you keep telling me to live the same way High, high flying up high High, high looking at the world What I saw won't be everything High, high running up high High, high running to the world The time that has passed is just a part of my long life What's the rush? Why are you so busy? We live according to a fixed time schedule I wanna fly, fly freely Fly, fly as hard as you can Spread the dreams you hid away Fly, fly above the sky Fly, fly up higher Don't whisper Scream our dreams High, high flying up high High, high looking at the world What I saw won't be everything High, high running up high High, high running to the world The time that has passed is just a part of my long life That was Taj Mahal for our 30th anniversary broadcast. The next song for our pirate broadcast is… Mister, this is broken again. Stop watching that. It's only been a day since my license has been renewed. You should've been careful. Looks like I can't watch it. Then don't, Miss! That darn temper of his. They're taking trips to outer space, but why can't they make 220 volt charges? This damn generator! Hey! I told you not to do that in my lab. I think it'll play. What's so good about that? What are you doing? This is the hippest dance lately. You still don't know music yet. Just hurry and help me set up the machine. Give it to me! Please give it to me! Hey, move out of the way. Oh yeah, the professor asked for you. Why are you telling me that now? (Acoustic Resistance Department Research Laboratory) Third floor. (UNLOCK) Did you forget my recommendation to the National Research Center? I didn't. Then what? Pay attention to other classes if you want to graduate. Other subjects bore me. You little...! Now you think you're some hot shot? Listen, boy. I'll cancel that recommendation if you keep this up. So do as you please! Not with those eyes, dummy. With menacing eyes! Try again! Jin-hee! Are you alright? What's going on? My arm! Does it hurt a lot? Ever seen a healthy person act like this? Actually, you should've avoided it. And I was in class. Hey! Patient D189, 2122, 0456, 8934. Don't even think about running away. If I can't use my arm, I'll clamp it with a new one. What a total fraud. Where are you going? What's that you're holding? This? This is a mirror. (Museum of Electronic Equipments) In the early 20th century, sound was played differently. Music was stored in hardware and was played. It was the most popular during that time. Probably during the 82nd impact, they all disappeared. And they stopped manufacturing it. There's only a picture of it now, but you're holding one. That's how precious it is. But why should I contact the government? There's a part called a 'SIM Chip' inside it. It's a very important part of the defense system now. It's probably worth 100,000 Pensilings... 100,000 Pensilings? Shall we sell it? No! If this is misused... Then you should know where to sell it. I don't. What about my hospital bill? Huh? Since I make weapons, I came here a few times before. He's a very dangerous person. It's this way. I told you he's a very dangerous man. I'll do the negotiating, so you just watch. Yes, it's real indeed. There's been too many fakes lately. Will 50,000 Pensilings be okay? 50,000? Well, 100,000... Okay, that'll be fine. Do you have to check? You don't trust me? Wanna drink? No, I'm okay. Bye. It's all here. It wasn't because I was scared. People say that he's brutal. What was it? He chopped off some guy's wrists for checking the money. And in a different case... I don't want to sell it. Because you got less money? It's not just because of money. Then why? Didn't you see their faces? They'll kill us. Ouch, it hurts! A pretty girl like you seems to be clueless. The deal's over after it's sold. It's over when I say it is. Get out! This is for the hospital bill. How did we get out? Bastards erased my memory. I can't remember a thing. You were knocked out with one punch. Do you like old music? What are you talking about? Aren't we being chased right now? What the hell? Turn it down. This is illegal. Just listen to the music. It's a relic of mine. I remember something clearly when I was five. I moved my iron arm for the first time. My body leaned to one side and I almost fell. A man wearing white clothes approached to me. He handed that to me and left. Saying that it belonged to my parents. That's all that I remember. Whether I had parents. This is the only clue. I think I can repair this. It'll be a bit tough. But the problem is the power. They used 220 volts in the 21st century. So I just need to find the right adaptor. I like using it as a mirror better. Let me repair it! You said 220 volts, right? J18 University, Acoustic Resistance major. You probably won't serve in the military like others. Anyway, can you really repair this? For a guy who didn't serve... It's done. See? Guys who didn't serve are all the same. Just as I had predicted. This line and that line were corroded So I made a new connection Maybe you used the wrong gasoline. Move! Fix it. Honey... L-O-V-e? My wife... Drinks are on me today! Yes! When I went to work, my wife always gave me a kiss. On my chest, shoulder... - ...neck and lips. - ...neck and lips. That's right. Do you know how many times you've told me that? Thirteen times. That's how much my wife loved me. Mom... You better take her home. Yes? I'm exhausted... I can't move my arm. This was also used as a weapon long time ago? No, it was used to talk to people and to listen to music Then repair it for me. When I listen to music, I can't hear the bombing sounds. You made this? Yeah. You can even kill a person with it at 90 hertz. Killing a person with sound... No. Using sound as a weapon, I'm evading the military. But my professor needs to permit... (I-Phones and 21st Century Living Patterns) How on earth did you get this? Anyway, can you turn this on? Yeah. I wrote a thesis five years ago. A power of 600 milli-amperes... I think it was 500 milli-amperes. It was 600 milli-amperes, okay? And there is a so-called 'USB port'. If I have that, then it could initiate the power function. If I have that, then it could initiate the power function. Here we go. Ouch! I got electrocuted! It hurts! I told you it was 500 milli-amperes! No, it was 600 milli-amperes! Move aside. Let me try it. -What? -I'll give it a try. Careful. You'll get electrocuted. Can't do it without gloves. Wait a minute... It's done. Wait a second. Push to unlock? It's telling us to push it. Okay, here I go. Why did it turn off? Wait a minute. Professor, did you do something to it? What are you talking about? It told me to push it, so that's all I did. What are you doing to this thing? You keep breaking it! What did you say? What have you accomplished until now? Hey boy, watch your mouth! It told me to push it, and that's all that I did! Just put it back! Hurry and turn it on! Hey, what did I do wrong? You didn't accomplish anything! What are you talking about? I pushed it because it said so! Forget it! Just hurry and turn it on! I hate you! What a great landscape. Is this baby that girl? Yes, I think it is. What now? It turned off again. What a headache. If it doesn't work this time, it's over. Is there another way? I don't know. Do you like her? No, I met her today for the first time. Forget it then. For an Acoustic Resistance major, why can't you fix things right? Sorry. Will it work if I kick it like last time? See you at school tomorrow. Are you okay? I'm okay. That line is the D3 line. One of the parts that you made. If you connect that and the USB, then you can turn it on. But your equipment can't be used. Then you will have to serve the military. An air-raid alarm has been issued for Sector B29. Citizens, please evacuate to the bomb shelters immediately. A bombing by fighter planes is predicted for Sector B29. Then fix it for me. When I listen to music, I can't hear the bombing sounds. What's the matter? The song you hum has lyrics. I had an arm. Jin-hee! Mom! Jin-hee! Shall I carry Jin-hee on my back? Jin-hee, say hi to daddy. Hi! No matter how much time has passed Could I go by your side? Could I go? No matter how many clouds have passed Could I go by your side? Could I go? Like a green broccoli If you turn green Could I return to you? Could I go by your side? Or could I deliver My song or my love at least I love you Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! love you, I love you love you, I love you love you, I love you That kid should finish school instead. No matter how much time has passed Could I go by your side? But he looks like a natural. No matter how many clouds have passed Could I go by your side? Could I go?
