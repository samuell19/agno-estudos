He's in Lockup 3. NURSE 2: Beat himself bloody again? We found him on the fire escape jerking himself off. [gasps] His desperation for pleasure must be extraordinary. Can you imagine? No, I can't. Doctors figure he'll kill himself just to end the desire. We'll I'll look in on him later. Well just make sure his hands are secured. He's calm when he knows he can't reach it. Amadea started singing about an hour ago. He thinks he's auditioning for the David Letterman Show. [shill screams] Oh, that's Bo.

Bill, she has totally destroyed her room. She wrote, "die bitch," on the window shade. I also found this. Silver Oak Asylum. Bill, she is sick. Maybe it's not hers. Maybe it's-- Bill, look at her! Do you think she's sane? It would explain everything, wouldn't it? Baton Rouge. She must have been there. Bill, you've got to do something. I'll give it a call. [receiver clicks] Operator, yes, could I have the information, please, for Baton Rouge? DOCTOR: Mr. Kelly, I'm Dr. Paine, Milly's doctor. Would you mind explaining your relationship with her, please? BILL (ON PHONE): Uh-- yes, I'm her son. I see. Well, we found this hospital shirt with your label on it. She's been under our care until she left here a few days ago. Is she with you? Well yes, she is. Doctor, how long has she been at your facility? Eight years. When did she get there? BILL (ON PHONE): Just a few days ago. She told me she was living in Paris. She's been under our constant care since 1981. Look, Mr. Kelly, she's very dangerous. She killed a guard when she escaped from here. And Louisiana State Police have an all points out on this one. It's imperative that we get her back and under sedation as soon as possible. Listen, the longer she goes without medication, the more violent she's liable to become. Doctor, this comes as quite a shock. Why was she at your hospital? Well, let me see. She was living in a French Quarter with a sculptor. But she refuses to talk about it. We didn't even know her real name until you called. Chevalier was the sculptor's name. But they weren't married. The sculptor was having an affair with another woman. She found them together and, according to the police, killed them with one of his sculptures. And she was judged incompetent to stand trial and turned over to us for lifetime care. What? Uh-- my god-- ah. Mr. Kelly, if you'll just give me your address, and I'll call the local police. Look, Doctor, I would rather handle this without the police. I'm sure you understand. Well take her to a local facility and have her get under sedation. She must remain as calm as possible. I understand, Doctor. DOCTOR (ON PHONE): Mr. Kelly, you're dealing with a very dangerous woman. Now if you'll just give me your address. Mr. Kelly, are you there? I have to have her-- Mr. Kelly-- hello? [receiver clicks] That bitch is poisoning your mind. She's turning you against me. No. Look, Mom, we're just trying to help you. Look, Billy. She's trying to kill me. She wants me dead, I know it. I am not trying to kill you, mother. I'm on your side. I'm trying to help you. Then you get the fuck out of our lives. Oh, Billy, she's evil, evil. Look-- look, Mom, it's just for you own good. I won't go back there. I won't go back. They're not your family, I am. Mom, we are all family here, all of us. No, no, no, you treacherous bastard, I'm your mother. Take it easy, Mom. [panting] No, I won't back there. I won't go back! [violins screeching] You! Fuck you, you bitch! You turned everyone-- Mom! Mom! [suitcase bumping down steps] Todd, get one of my suitcases and separate this load. Leave that alone. I don't want your stinking suitcase. Just take the shit to the car, OK? [grunting] I'm sorry, Mom. It's You for your own good. Just take it easy. [inaudible] One, two, come on. [crying] Stop it, oh! Oh! Oh!

[grunting] She should sleep through the night. [grunting and slowly sighing] Uh-- could I be alone with my mother for just a minute? Sure. [sentimental music] I wish it didn't have to be like this. I really missed you. [birds chirping] ARLENE: I'm worried about Carmen, Bill. BILL: Arlene! ARLENE: I mean, that wasn't like her. She's very dependable. BILL: Here, hold this, will you?
