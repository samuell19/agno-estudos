- Field Unit one, Field Unit one, May 28th, 5:19 p.m, inhibitor test, pre-show rehearsal, entity is 53%. - Ben, let's go! Setlist. Kep, can you get your box of science shit out of the van before we go? - No. - Gotcha. Not a scientist, you majored in English. - I'm changing this whole thing. - You both invited everyone you know right? Are you high? - I got them for everybody, no one's even trying them. - Kep, you wanna walk me through this fiasco here? What am I looking at? - Acoustic induction inhibitor, my design. Attached to the pre-amp stage, we all have 'em. - Oh good. - Zero dilation level but I already set it so don't touch it - Right. - This is volume, volume is volume obviously. - This is gonna help something? - The overload in theory will shut us down before-- - Oh god, oh god, okay, okay. - The situation. - What's this field test? - It's research. I have a theory. - Can we all just cool it and act like a normal regular band for like a half hour, 40 minutes? Anybody have a pick? - Only have one. - How do you only have one pick? - I only use one. - She only needs one pick! One, two, three, four - We need to borrow some emergency scenarios for tonight. ♪ I wanna go down ♪ ♪ To the deep end ♪ - You're rushing. ♪ Get back what's gone wrong ♪ ♪ You've been keeping ♪ ♪ Down the aisles ♪ ♪ Inbetween the rows, ohhhh ♪ ♪ I wanna go down ♪ ♪ I needed someone-- ♪ - Max. ♪ I wanna slow down-- ♪ - Still starting fires Max. - Okay before we all get totally sidetracked we're dragging the verse tempo. - Max. - The verse tempo is perfect. - Totally disagree. - Still happening Max. - Well something happened Ben, yes. - How's the inhibitor? - It's fine. - It didn't do anything did it? - This is the same as Kenny from Banowitz' house party and the garage two weeks ago and you know it. - How come you get to be Kep? I'm a Kepell too, we should get the same nickname. - It's confusing. - You're amp caught fire in the garage, not Kep's. - You have got to be kidding me. - Kenny's house? I mean like why are we responsible for every basement with bad wiring all of a sudden? - It's not the wiring. - Ben's right, scorch marks on the power transformer are identical to the frame at Banowitz' house party. This whole area here, it's incredibly unclear what's going on in this area. - Okay, can we, I understand we're all a little jazzed up right now but we have a show to play, like an actual show at a rock club. First one, long time coming and you know we're not gonna cancel on the account of a little smoke. - A little smoke from what? - Don't be ominous, don't be sensational. - Are we really talking about canceling, why? Because of that? - Can you get us up and running in the next hundred minutes? - Barely. - How can we play tonight? There's one shitty emergency exit in that place. - Plus the front door, that's two. - Canceling now is really unprofessional. - Okay, band meeting, I didn't wanna get any hopes up but I have it on good authority that Pool Party Eddy is coming tonight. That's a big fly - Very good authority in fact. And y'know, you get Pool Party Eddy and-- - Pool party Eddy parties. - Exactly, Pool Party Eddy parties, Pool Party Eddy parties lead to blogs and blogs lead to vlogs, vlogs lead to y'know whatever, so on and so forth, but like hey, do I agree that one guy gets to decide which band is which? No, but that's what's going on right now and that's how it works now apparently, so that's what's happening. - Guys. - What good is Pool Party Eddy if we burn him to death? - It's never gonna be perfect Corkus, we can't keep obsessing over every little thing. Hey! - What is that? - It's a tape. - Wow. - A tape? - Yeah, like a tape, it was a tape anyways. - It's the research. - Wait, so what are you saying, you're saying that you put those down there and-- ? What are you saying? It's not the wiring. What the hell does that mean? We liquefy tapes? - So awesome. - Looks, it's never happened twice in a row, so it's not gonna happen tonight, it's sporadic. Empirically speaking, that's good science. Plus Kep, I mean you'll have a chance to get more data. - Hmm. - I wanna play as much as anybody, you think I don't wanna play awesome shows all day long? But I have to refill another extinguisher at the fire house now. Sooner or later someone's gonna start asking questions. - I don't wanna have to refill anything, I just wanna do what we've been trying to do for once, one time. - Okay, fine, no one else cares whether we survive or not, neither do I. I've done all this safety shit and obviously, no one's taking it seriously. - Do you have any idea how many Kelvins we must be generating to do something like this? - We're wearing-- - Anybody? - The jumpsuits tonight. It's a lot - Huh! - That was insane. My heart is pounding, feel like I could go for a run right now. Huh, feel my pulse. - We shouldn't have done that, that was bad. - Right, you're right. Someone could've died. - Who exactly could've died? Nobody came. - Not nobody, Pool Party Eddy came, right? He coulda died. - No he wasn't there, six weeks we've been playing this-- - I think the field unit's out, so frustrating. 18 tape decks down the drain Why's Roka not here? Hi. I got the tapes. - Roka. - I hope we're not playing there again, that was wild. The ceiling collapsed on the front entrance. Ben was totally right about the emergency exits, it was totally shut so the sound guy and I had to escape through the bathroom window. I feel incredible. - Right! - That was the best show ever. That was the most fun I've had probably since Kep's birthday party. - That was a good party. - It was the best party. You're burned, that looks really bad. - Max, I know I've been a real stickler about the safety shit and everything but I get it now, exact same page. - Are you crazy? - I feel a little crazy. - We coulda killed somebody. If they'd showed up. - Pool Party Eddy showed up. - What, no he didn't, we're dangerous. - A million bands are dangerous. - Bands play shows people go to. They don't liquefy tapes. We're just four people starting fires together. - Yeah and how many bands do you know that can do that? - Are you okay? - I don't know, I don't know? What's clicking? - What is that? - My geiger-counter. - Roka, c'mere - Baby Kep. - Kep, you were saying something about the data. Somehow inaudible frequencies created by the four of us are generating what I now believe to be a self sustaining, electromagnetic, feedback loop of unstable, possibly radioactive energy, which is by passing the pre-amp stage entirely. That's why the inhibitors don't work. - Frequencies, you've heard of this? - No one has heard of this, to my knowledge. - He did come. Oh my god, Sarah Jepsen's got a renovation party. - Inspector Guardian's playing that show, it's gonna be packed. We're doing it right? - Obviously. - We have to do it. - We could burn the place down. - Sarah's parents are done on the existing structure anyway, we'll be doing them a favor. Plus, Kep would have a chance to get more data. - Hmm. Privates, all right. Whoo! - I'm not saying we didn't sound good. Band meeting, Kep, brass tacks, what are we dealing with science wise. - For starters, we've possibly created an entirely new energy-- - I like that, I wanna come back to that. But short term, more like for Friday, survival wise. - Us or the crowd? - Us AND the crowd. - We're gonna have to focus on containment, I can modify the inhibitors but we're gonna need more than jumpsuits. - Can we still get the lightning? - We're gonna have to purchase a few things. - Okay, who wants to keep going, let's see about burning this house down Friday. - Why is he called Pool Party Eddy? - He had a pool party one time, someone died. - Oh no. - Yeah, right. - Of course back then he was just Eddy. - Well that's not a very good nickname.
