0SS 117: PANIC IN BANGKOK Colonel, Mr. Smith is calling for you urgently. Thank you. Christopher Lemmon, who represented our service in Thailand... was killed as he was about to shed light on this case. He passed on some very alarming information. Cases of the plague in India. Overpopulation, relative hygiene. Is that anything exceptional? Not at first sight. Coincidentally, these cases of plague... seem to follow anti- cholera vaccinations... from the Hogby Laboratories in Bangkok. Incredible, eh? I'll show you the documents I was sent. March 1. In the Bombay region... the army burned a plague- infested village. March 8. Four cases of plague identified in a Chandernagore hospital. We await Lemmon's replacement. - Using my intuition... - You're right. It's you. Oh! How clumsy! So sorry. I hope nothing's broken. Oh, sorry. Your film is fogged. Give me your address. I'll send you a blow-up. No, there's no need. Thank you. No. Not this one, the other. - Here, take this. Hotel Erawan. - Thank you, sir. I'm Hubert Barton. I have a room reserved. Take my bag up. I'll be back around 8:00 pm. Very good, sir. 224 Rajdamnern Central Avenue. Miss? Thank you. The fourth? What a coincidence. I absolutely must see you again... to give you an enlargement of this photo. You can obtain a print at any hour of the night... by asking for me at the Hotel Erawan, Room 236. No doubt you'd prefer home delivery. What's your address? - Good morning. - Good morning. Stop bothering me. I'm here to work. - Me too. - What's wrong, Eva? Mr. Leacock, could you get rid of this maniac who followed me here? - Get out, sir. - No. - Come in, then. - Thank you. - Tell me what this means. - Mr. Leacock, no doubt. Mr. Smith asked me to give you this letter which will give you all the necessary explanations. In that case, Mr. Barton, what can I do to help you? That's an odd way of putting people in their place! My place? That's where I am. And I intend to stay here. I'll even ask you to ﬁx a meeting with Professor Hogby. With pleasure. Who shall I say? If you hadn't torn up my card, you'd know. This is Mr. Barton, our new associate. - My name is Hubert. - My secretary, Miss Eva Davidson. Charmed. - You have full powers? - Yes. I'm thrilled. I'll ﬁnally be able to take a month's vacation. I doubt that. It won't last a month, and I'll be needing you. But in the meantime... ...are you satisfied with your secretary? - Yes. You trust her implicitly? You should be aware that all our staff were subjected to strict screening. Of course. But like all humans, they have faults as well as qualities. - Is she intelligent? - Yes. - Conscientious? - Yes. Curious? You scared me. I came to tell you Professor Hogby's expecting you at 4:00. Thank you, Eva. Come, Barton, you don't think Professor Hogby distributes polluted vaccines? I never said that. - He's a professional. - Let's investigate and see. You'll have to introduce me to Bangkok's notables as Lemmon's successor. I'll do it today. There's a party at the American embassy. - Here's an invitation. - Perfect. By the way, do you know that man in the glasses? Never seen him before. Why? He followed me from the airport. I must look friendly to him. Let me have the complete file on this case. With pleasure. Take care of it. It's the only copy. Unique pieces are the ones that excite collectors. - You are Mr. Sonsak? - Yes, sir. Hubert Barton, Christopher Lemmon's replacement. - Would you do me a favor? - With pleasure. Did Lemmon have a car? Yes. It's in the garage. I have the keys. Right. Bring it round to the Hotel Erawan tonight at 8:00. Bring the keys and my bag to Room 236. - Very well, Mr. Barton. - See you later. To Hogby Laboratories. Whatever happens, keep going as fast as you can. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. - Here. - Thank you. Good- bye. How may I help you? I have a meeting with Professor Hogby. I'm a little late. I'm sorry, but he left. I'm Hubert Barton. Yes. I'd noted that. But someone called to cancel your appointment. Who called? Man or woman? I didn't take the call personally. - When will he be back? - Not for a few days. Never mind. Could you call me a cab for the Hotel Erawan? Certainly. Come in. - Hello, Mr. Barton. - Hello, Mr. Sonsak. Here are the car keys. It's parked out front. Thank you. I know Christopher Lemmon thought a lot of you. Mr. Lemmon honored me with his trust and friendship. - Here's your case. - Thank you. Can I do anything else for you? Yes. I've a favor to ask you. Watch my room while I'm at the embassy. - You think someone will come? - It's not impossible. If you have a visitor, how can I warn you? Press this book's button, Mr. Sonsak. Ingenious device. Sit down. Here's some reading. The latest magazines from New York. Thank you. As soon as you see or hear anything suspicious... switch off the light, go onto the balcony and press the button, like earlier. I'll come and join you immediately. How will you join me if there's someone in the room? I'll go through the room next door. You think of everything. I always rent the room next door on principle. It's often come in handy. - It's an education working with you. - Thank you. - Good evening, Mr. Sonsak. - Thank you, Mr. Barton. Excuse me. - Good evening. - Good evening. - You haven't seen Barton? - Not yet. He must have met a pretty girl. Not that pretty, then. Here he is. A man who knows how to talk to women! Come and dance. Aren't you surprised to see me? Not really. - Weren't you meant to come? - Yes. Did you see Professor Hogby? - Indeed, no. - Why? Someone canceled. My secretary, I was told. Why did you do that? Me? Why would I do that? I was with Mr. Leacock all the time. - Lucky man. - I'll have him confirm it. Did I say I doubted your word? You're blonde with green eyes. And the woman I dream of... is always a blonde with green eyes. You're jumping the gun. That's why I'm well paid. I don't know you yet. Alas. But what does tomorrow hold? Perhaps I'll be dead. No blackmail. It makes me thirsty. Give me a whiskey instead. With pleasure. - Hello, Doctor. - Ambassador. - Good to see you. - Hello. Good evening, miss. Would you care to dance? - Yes. - Good evening. Good evening, Dr. Sinn. - Dr. Sinn. - Hubert Barton. My associate, replacement for Christopher Lemmon. Mr. Barton, welcome to Bangkok. - You like the Orient? - I love the unexpected. Some successions are heavy to bear. Your predecessor's dramatic end... I'll see what the future holds. The future is an illusion. The past is but a memory. Only the present matters. How right you are, Dr. Sinn. What you say reminds me of a Wild West proverb. “The egg is in the bird, as the bird is in the egg.” Of course. Come and dance. - Who is that man? - Dr. Sinn. A fashionable physician in Bangkok's American colony. Healer, magician, hypnotist, magus. The women are wild about the mysterious Dr. Sinn. Who's the girl who came with him? I don't know her, but I do know someone who could introduce you. No need. Sorry to interrupt, my dear man. The ambassador's wife is shouting for you. - Ambassador's wife? - The duties of your post. I'm sorry. Please excuse me. The name's Hubert. Hubert Barton. And I'm Lila Sinn. How did Mr. Barton come to replace Lemmon? I don't know. You haven't that much work at Robinson and Co. - What does he do between meals? - Courts women. You don't give in to his advances? You're not serious, Guna. At least, I hope not. Dr. Sinn just informed me that only the present matters. It must be the climate, but... I'm beginning to share his views. My brother is very perceptive. - Dr. Sinn is your brother? - Of course. What did you think? Nothing. But he wasn't right to conclude that the future is an illusion. The future can be full of wonderful realities. You're a brunette with green eyes, Lila. How strange. The woman I dream of is always brunette with green eyes. I'm sorry, but I have to go. - So soon? Why? - A man has just come in. I absolutely mustn't see him. You're scared of him? I'm scared of nothing. Not even love at ﬁrst sight. You believe in love at ﬁrst sight? I believe in fate. My name's Hubert. I believe in fate too. And I live in Room 236, Hotel Erawan. What are you telling me? - You don't mean... - What are you thinking? I've noticed that fate is rarely favorable when I forget to give my address. Excuse me. I really must go. Leave it to me. Don't move. Tell me who you work for. Talk! Mr. Sonsak? Mr. Sonsak! Feeling better? - Where is he? - He popped downstairs. - What did he want? - We'll ﬁnd out. “Dr. Sinn.” - Didn't think you'd see me so soon? - She was here ﬁrst. She agreed to give up her place so gracefully. Please. You are the greatest charmer in the West. In the USA, perhaps. What can I do for you? You don't seem to need me. You're wrong, Doctor. If not for a consultation, at least for some advice. - Sit down. - Thank you. Fire away. I've only been in Bangkok two days. Since I arrived, I've had strange disorders. Such as? Yesterday, I felt I was being tailed by a car. And when I went home after the party last night, and I suppose I was rather tired, but it seemed like a man was searching my room and ﬁghting me. To what do you attribute that, Doctor? A sudden change of climate. A very different atmosphere. Here, conscious and unconscious don't run on the same lines. Your case is nothing extraordinary. It sometimes affects Westerners: difficulty discerning real from unreal, the concrete from the imaginary. It's a painful psychological state. Curious, at least. - ls it serious? - Depends. Some adapt to it, and some never do. - And you consider me...? - Unadaptable. - But there is a way to relieve you. - What? Suggestion. - Which consists of...? - It's very simple. I just hypnotize you. - And that really works? - Always. Would you like to try it? With pleasure, but I've an urgent date. Regrettable. Your case interests me. You'll feel so much better. No worries, no anxiety. Something like eternal beatitude? A bit like that. Cross your legs. - Excellent reﬂexes. - I'm happy with them. Reflexes are ineffective against occult powers. You're talking to a materialist, Doctor. In this land, Mr. Barton, everything is possible. Auditory and visual hallucinations... obsessive tendency to persecution. It could get worse unless you're careful. Are you staying long in Thailand? Several months, health permitting. The climate doesn't suit you. I advise you to turn your mind... from the matters worrying it presently. Don't stay too long in Bangkok, Mr. Barton. Meantime, take one pill morning and night. You can take one now. It's a tranquilizer. I'd rather tranquilize myself for now. I'll take them if I need them. Thanks. As you wish. - Thanks for your advice. - That's why I'm here. Might I ask what your fees are? I don't know how to thank you. I'd have been glad to say hello to your charming sister. I'm sorry. She's just gone out. Please be good enough to pass on my respects. Consider it done. You've done me a lot of good. No doubt I'll be seeing you soon. Thank you. We were right to believe in fate. Was our meeting really accidental? Accidental is an ugly word. I'd sooner say it was providential. Glad to have met you. I must be getting home. No. I need you. You can't refuse me. - I assure you that... - As a favor. An antiques dealer, our company's client, asked me to look for jades, ancient objets d'art... and curiosities typical of Bangkok. Without your help, I feel totally incapable. With pleasure. But another day. Today is quite impossible. All right. Please put it to one side. I'll call our client. If he decides, I'll be back. - Very good, Mr. Barton. - Thank you. Good- bye. Look. That's pretty. I'm getting peckish and I hate lunching alone. - Where are we going? - Sorry. I must go home. You can't refuse me lunch. I'd love to, but it's quite impossible. Now you really must take me back. Yes. Waiter! If I were your brother, I wouldn't let you live anywhere but with me. The house where I live was our parents' house. My brother needs to be near his clientèle. That's why he lives alone in a ﬂat at his office. And he's always been a loner. - A loner with three servants! - Only during the day. At night he ﬁnds company in his books. I imagined a less austere life for a man as attractive as him. Don't worry about him. He lets himself go now and then. I've an idea. Tonight, let's take him from his meditation. - No. - He can eat with us. I can tell you that tonight that's quite impossible. He's already been taken by Miss Eva Davidson. Shame. I'm happy, Guna, spending tonight with you. Me too, Eva. It's a rare pleasure, you must admit. Shouldn't I see to others before myself... and therefore you? Yes, Doctor. I know. There's only one way I can see you more often: to fall gravely ill. Pass me the screwdriver. Excuse me, Doctor. You're wanted urgently on the phone. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Hand me the transmitter. Who'll activate it? The slightest sound vibration picked up by the microphone establishes contact and activates the transmitter. What if Dr. Sinn comes home early? That'd be a shame. I don't need you here. Go to the car and listen. When I speak, if the device is activated and the recording works, stay in the car. If not, come up and tell me. Okay, Mr. Barton. Sorry for the hitch, Eva. I'll go home for my bag then drop you off. I'll be a good while. It's a serious case. I'm beginning to feel that mine is desperate. Mr. Sonsak, [hope the mike's working and the recorder is functioning correctly. I'll be ﬁnished here in two minutes. Wait for me. I'll fetch my bag. I'll drop you at home. - The recorder works? - Fine, Mr. Barton. I heard everything you said. I'll be ﬁnished here in two minutes. Perfect. Keep listening. If you hear anything important, call me. Very good. Good night, Mr. Sonsak. Don't fall asleep. You scared me. I didn't expect such a pleasant visitor. I didn't expect to see you come in through the window, Mr. Barton. My name's Hubert. Have you forgotten already, Lila? Hubert, a chambermaid let me in so I could wait here. I came because I've something very serious to tell you. But it's not at all serious. Because I love you too. Please don't joke. It really is serious. Hubert, you mustn't stay in Bangkok. It's becoming a family mania, wanting to see me go. Your brother gave me the same advice. My brother has a surprising power, a second sight. It always comes true. I'm sorry, but I don't believe that kind of thing. Then remember that he knows a lot of people, very important people, and he has the gift of being able to read their thoughts. In the West, you would call him a psychologist. Yes. So what? I'm asking you to follow his advice. You can trust him. I need time to think. No whiskey for me. Just water, thanks. Hubert, listen to me. I'm very afraid for you. I'm touched by your concern, but don't let dark thoughts spoil the pleasure of being together. The reason I came and I'm so insistent is that... I hope Mr. Barton has understood the threat. To avoid the fate of Christopher Lemmon, he'll probably decide to leave Bangkok. That's possible too. But if he does, he won't get far. Someone's seeing to him right now. I'll keep you informed. Good- bye. What's the matter? I don't feel very well. Hello, Mr. Barton? Mr. Barton. Sonsak here. It's urgent. It's serious. Hello? Hello? Give me Room 258, miss. Hello? You can come. Where are we going? This isn't the airport road. Change of instructions. But I have his passport, his ticket and a sick note from my brother so he can embark on the flight for Washington. Before leaving, the patient must undergo a small formality. Take him to the experiments room... and sit him in the chair. Where's my brother? He won't be coming. What's going on here? I have new orders. What orders? What will you do to him? Interrogate him. No one can resist this device. You have no right! I forbid it! Take her away. Leave me alone with Mr. Barton. A latest- generation lie detector, fully equipped. Everything needed for brainwashing. Let's see if it works. Don't think you'll get away with this! - Someone will come. - No. You remember. You asked to be left alone. The doors are too thick. No one will hear you. Who are you? Who are you? My name is Akhom. Who do you work for? For the Elected People. Who is the Elected People? What are its aims? Who is the Elected People? What are its aims? The Elected People is an association of wise men, the victims of atomic madness who may annihilate the whole world. What means would they use to destroy other races? A new plague virus. - Eva Davidson is your accomplice? - I don't know her. - Who killed Christopher Lemmon? - I and my men. Lemmon was a danger to the Elected People. He had to be eliminated. How many men? - Six. - Where are they? Three down by the jetty, three near the house. All armed. And what are your duties? What are your duties? I'm here to make people talk. Attention. Bring Miss Sinn to the experiments room. Face the wall! Quick! Help me. There. Better than a sleeping pill. Much more efficient. Be good. I'll go out that way. I'll attract the three men guarding the villa and those watching the jetty. While they're chasing me, leave this way and take the outboard. Where will I meet you? Go round the island and land on the other bank. But, Hubert, they'll kill us! You'll bring me good luck. Here's my talisman. Excuse me. Get up! Do something! Untie me! Look! The boat to the left! Look. Let's go. You are in danger. You can't go home. - Your brother is... - He won't harm me. If I'm in danger, he must be too. Anyway, now that you've helped me, my enemies are yours. Excuse me, Mr. Barton. But I know a place where Miss Sinn could stay in safety as long as she likes. Untie me! - Almost there, Mr. Barton. - Good. My friend Prasit and his family. - Prasit. - Yes. Could I ask you a favor? My house is your house. Your wish is my command. Mr. Barton is my friend. The young lady with him is in danger. Could she have asylum here? I will stake my life on her safety. Lila, don't leave here and wait for me. I promise. I checked all your clients' addresses. They're all honest firms, except for one. See for yourself. “Moulmein Hospital.” Moulmein, Burma. Well? I called the number. The hospital doesn't exist. But you've delivered crates of vaccines bearing this address. I'll check. Miss, bring me the Moulmein Hospital ﬁle. Right away, Professor. I don't see how you can conclude that ampoules from our labs contain the plague virus. - It's crazy! - Yes. But... Give me that. Six months ago, we dispatched 30 crates of cholera vaccines. What would you say if those crates didn't leave Bangkok docks... and were stolen, and your serum replaced by cultures of deadly plague virus? I'd say you read too many trashy thrillers. Might I telephone? If you're not scared of catching the plague. I know British stubbornness too well to try to convince you with proof. Hello, Eva? Leacock here. I'm at Hogby Laboratories. I have the missing proof. Call Hubert. Tell him to come by the office. Very well. I'll call right away. Hello? Tell the garage to bring my car around front in 10 minutes. Thank you, miss. Hello? Mr. Barton's car? We're on the case. Hurry. I just have to connect the battery wires. The clock will start when the ignition is turned to be sure he's in the car when it goes up. Give him 15 minutes... so it doesn't blow too close to the hotel. See for yourself. Ignition. Kill the ignition. It works. Now park the car in front of the hotel. Yes? It's me. Hello, Leacock. Yes, I've been here for an hour. - Eva hasn't called? - No. I don't understand. I told her to call half an hour before lunch. Right. You're on the right track, Barton. Thanks to Hogby, I have the key to this riddle. - Come over. - Okay, I'll be right there. I was expecting you, Mr. Barton. - There's important news. - Right. We've done the business on Hubert Barton. Any moment now he'll be history. The exchange of crates scheduled in two days' time will happen tonight at 4:00 am, in Warehouse 28. Mr. Sonsak, I'll be needing you tonight. With pleasure, Mr. Barton. My friend Prasit could make himself useful. Okay. Three of us would be better. Why not four? Be good enough to give me that tape, which will tell me when and whom we are to meet. Gladly. The more, the merrier. Might I be so bold as to ask for your keys? I came on foot. I left them in the car. To ensure you don't follow me, give me the keys to the truck too. Don't move. That's as much in my interest as in yours. Be careful, if you're taking my car. My brakes are rather slack. Who is this guy? Who was that guy? A former Nazi, a double agent. Always ready to serve the highest bidder. Now he's gone. The driver, Hubert Barton, of the ﬁrm Robinson and Co., died in the ﬂames. He was assassinated. Early investigations have not yet yielded a motive for the crime. Yes, I know. I heard it on the radio. Guna, I've always obeyed you without question. But you lied to me. You swore you wouldn't harm Hubert Barton. And he's just been murdered. You will pay for this crime. I didn't want Barton dead. If you don't believe me... shoot I understand your sorrow, Lila. I won't leave you again. I'll do everything to make you forget this tragedy. Sonsak. Be ready. They're about to go. We're heading north. We're carrying straight on. Straight on. Sonsak, we're coming to a monastery. A monastery. I only know one in that region. Hide close by. Be ready to step in at the ﬁrst sign. Unpack the equipment. We'll be needing it soon. Your attention, please. The grand master of our order has a communication for you of the greatest importance. Please stop working and go immediately to the meeting room. I have summoned the elite members of our brotherhood... to thank you for your effort... and congratulate you on the remarkable research results. Our new plague virus is ready. Those not immunized by our serum will die. Flowers, birds, wind and rain will spread death to all continents. The world will end in the multiplication of beings that one day the soil will no longer feed. What does it matter how many lumberjacks there are... if the forest has no more trees? What matter if, in ancestral migrations, clouds of birds disappear. Other birds will ﬂy farther. The time is come when, for the dignity of man, millions of men must perish. Barely- evolved nations with primitive philosophies risk causing our planet to crumble with their criminal atomic experiments. It is our duty to destroy them... leaving behind the spirituality of an ancient civilization. Then and only then will our goal have been attained. The victory of those who have gone beyond human... the elected race. Dr. Sinn, you are my prisoner. Order your followers to try nothing or you're dead. I order you to try nothing. Back to your places. Mr. Barton, despite your weapon and your smugness, you can do nothing against me. Stand aside! Mr. Barton, I did like you. But you've caused too much trouble. I shall now send you back to your country. After this injection, you'll sleep soundly for several days. And another I'll delight in administering, which contains our new virus. So the top American agent will have one last mission: contaminating his family and taking the plague to America. Dr. Sinn, you're mad! Take him to the operations room. Guna, you can't do this. It's impossible! Oh, yes I can. Your duty is to obey unhesitatingly. Don't make me regret your presence. You'll obey me like the rest, Eva. Very well. I shall obey you. Lila. - What do you want, Miss Davidson? - Lila, I need your help. I don't care anymore. Lila, help me. Guna has gone mad. - No one escapes their fate. - Lila. Listen to me. Hubert Barton is alive. Alive? Your brother has him prisoner. Only we can still save him. Prepare the anesthetic to my formula and administer it. Yes, Doctor. Come. Hurry. Be quick. Give him the injection. Watch out! - Hubert! - Come. This way! Come quick! Mr. Barton works well. We can't miss this. Watch out! - We're saved. - Along with millions of others.
