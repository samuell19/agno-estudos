THE BLIND SUNFLOWERS There's nothing I can say, Lord. Really. I can't, I don't know how. The Rector will see you now. OURENSE, SPRING OF 1940 Why did you send me to war? What a question! Because you had to go. We'd have had no chance without you boys. It was a Crusade, right? Right there, on the front line, with the flag raised high. With pride. With pride, you say? It's not easy, you know. It's just... You see things, Father. Things happen to you. Ideals can go either way. I never doubted ours. How could I? But war... The open wounds... Death every day... Those are instincts. What? They're instincts. You'll tell me about them. About brutality, horrific matters, even the deepest of sins. Well, yes. That is true. Yet still, think about this. These very same instincts are the seeds of heroism! First of all, you have to be alive to fight, and even more alive to win. Dead soldiers don't win battles. - I agree, obviously. But... - And life, Salvador... Life... Would you be shocked if I said sinning is a part of life? It's not about whether I'd be shocked or not. At this point nothing shocks me anymore. No. My problem is that... Do you have problems or sins? Both, father. Problems and sins. When your first taste of the world out of the seminary is war... Nobody can prepare you for that. I'm a deacon, a year away from saying mass... Have you lost your vocation? How should I know? I've done all sorts of stupid things. I've killed. I've executed people. I'd finish them off on the ground, as they looked me in the eye... But I had to close mine. My hand would shake. I'd miss. And I'd have to shoot again. And I've sinned a great deal. Don't worry about that. I mean don't worry more than is necessary. Leave your sins to Our Lord Jesus Christ, who fought his war on the cross, and to me... And your problems, to yourself and to me again. You're confused, and I understand. We all have been at some point in life. Therefore, you need time to see with clarity. The Bible, which is very wise, is also very pretty, very beautiful, very poetic. At one point, when referring to people who have lost their way, it says they are like blind sunflowers. They see no sunlight and wander lost... But the sun is out. There is light, Salvador. And it's guiding us. I'm sending you to teach at a school until June. To a milder war. To battle toddlers. - Good evening. - Good evening. Why do you have to leave? So the police won't catch Lalo. - What did he do? - Nothing. He wrote verses against priests and rich people. They'll kill him if they catch him. Why doesn't he hide with Dad? Because... Wait. Barley. And we have no sugar. Mom. - Should I take this coat? - Of course. It's bulky. And it's almost spring. Spring is treacherous, dear. Never trust it. Here. Eat your breakfast, we'll be late. Are you sure you know what you're doing? If I weren't, I'd stay here. Don't you trust me? It's not about that. The problem is Oliveira Salazar is best friends with Franco. Portugal could be a trap. Okay. Good morning. Sorry, I was in the bathroom. Good morning. You know how my aunt is. She insisted I bring you the receipt, since today's - the 16th. - Friday, I'm turning in work on Friday. I would never make a fuss about it myself. - It's my aunt. - I know. I must take my son to school. Duty comes first. I was on my way to mass, in fact. Shall I tell her Friday at the latest? Yes, yes. It was the landlady's niece. Can these people be trusted? They already snuck two friends of mine over. We'll go at night. There they'll give us fake papers and help us get to Lisbon. Lisbon no less! I didn't know you were going so far. And with Elena pregnant? You're crazy. She's my wife and she's coming with me. She'll be your wife when you marry. Elena, please. Please. We'll get married in America. - America? Why America? - That's enough! We're going to America and that's that. America is our future. Should I stay here and be hunted down like a rabbit? Come on, Lorenzo. It's getting late. The boy is right. I'd do the same if I could. If you two used your heads more, we'd all be better off. It'll be fine, you'll see. Darling, take this too. We don't need it and it weighs a ton. Trust me. I'll carry it. - Don't cry. - Mom... There, there. Everything will work out just fine. Don't cry. Come on. Take care of them for me. Take care of them. The flags of victory will return, marching merrily along in peace and bringing five red roses, the arrows of my quiver. Spring will laugh again, which we await by air, land and sea. Onward, squadrons, to victory, that a new day dawns on Spain! Spain! United! - Spain! - Great! Spain! Free! Long live Franco! - Onward Spain! - Onward! Get to class, go on. Therefore, regardless of what you hear at home, school is not where you come only to learn things you'll need to make a living. Knowing how to make buildings is important. Running a business, healing the sick... But what matters most in the end is educating yourself as people. As Christians and as Spaniards. Together we can make that happen. Can we make it happen? - Can we together? - Yes! What's your name? Lorenzo Mazo Martínez. How about it? Can we all be good Christians and good Spaniards? I think so, Father. Okay. Tuesday... arithmetic. - Do you know your four basics? - Yes. Lorenzo, can you multiply? Yes, Father. And divide. How old are you? Seven. Okay, come to the board. Give me 24 divided by six. Very good. Who taught you to divide? My mother. Doesn't your father know how? He died. In the war? My mother won't talk about it. Is she the lady who brought you to school this morning? Any brothers and sisters? No. I can't go on. Come on. Come on. I can't go any further. We're almost there. These woods end at the Portuguese border. We have to reach it before dawn. I'm cold. And it hurts. We won't make it. Rest. Careful, don't cut yourself. - I won't. - Where are you going? Bird hunting. - With a shotgun? - No, something called birdlime. Give it here. Hurry, they'll be waiting. All right. Offer some of your omelet when you eat. What if they eat it? They won't. It's just being polite. Go and give Daddy a kiss. Dad... I'm leaving. Where to? To the countryside with friends. What about school? You're so out of touch... It's Thursday. Camilo, Paquito's dad, is taking us. Be careful. I will, Dad. How is it coming? I'm finishing. You can turn it in tomorrow. I hope they pay me. Of course they'll pay you! You're right. Pour me a drink. There's another! You scared them away again! Wait until they're all in the traps! One, two, three, four, five, six... Twelve plus one makes 13. A baker's dozen. But this one is no good. It only sings. - Anyone want it? - Me, me! He's yours. You two, gather wood. Up you go. Here. Plenty of water and birdseed. Now get to work. Know how to skin them? - Skin what? - The birds, dummy. Gotta skin them before you fry them! - Good afternoon. - Hello! So nice to see you again. - How are you, my dear lady? - Fine, fine. And you? Not as fine as you. And so punctual. So easy to work with. A first rate job. Clean, without a single correction. You're too kind. I've brought the bill. I have payments to make tomorrow... But of course! Love must be paid back with love. Go ahead and make your call. - You don't mind? - Not at all. I'm happy to be of service. Aunt Lola. How are you? And the rest of you? Not great, because Elena left. Then that does it. You and little Lorenzo by yourselves... Wouldn't you be better with me? I've considered it, believe me. I do think about it. I have to go. Big kiss, Auntie. Thank you. We Germans don't mess around. - Are you German? - No, I'm from Betanzos. But, like the common saying goes, your country is wherever you earn your living. How is it that you speak German? During the war I exchanged letters with a Condor Legion pilot. Please, that's impossible. You learned German writing letters? He was killed by the Reds. My deepest condolences. The truth is, I don't know where we'd be without the generous aid of our German comrades. But we Spaniards are grateful. And now, with our wolfram, the Führer will conquer Europe. It's life, son. What can you do? You think he'd pick the frying pan instead of the cage? I know. It makes me sad. The water's still too cold, but Paquito said we'll be able to swim in the river soon. Sure. It's almost summertime. Yeah, but since I can't swim... You'll learn. Paquito's dad taught him. You don't want to go to the river? Well, sure I do. When will you be able to? We'll go. We'll go. Where's Portugal? Over there. Come on, dinner must be ready by now. Here. You think he'll sing? Definitely. We're here, Mom. Coming. Okay. What's for dinner, Mom? Pickled sardines and salad. Go on, set the table. You know what, Mom? Paquito said I never let them come over and play. What should we do? We don't want people talking. Have them over. Give them a snack and that's that. Yes, something like that. Lorenzo, Elena isn't here. Oh. I forgot. Damn it! Come on! - What's the matter? - I still have no milk. Milk we do have! Facing the sun in my new shirt that you embroidered in red yesterday, that's how death will find me if it takes me and I don't see you again. I'll take my place alongside my companions... - Why aren't you singing, son? - I am singing. No, you're not. You take me for a fool? You don't know the lyrics, or don't you like them? He doesn't understand them. Pardon me? I said my son doesn't want to die, he wants to live. To live for me. For his mother. Well, I understand. But the fatherland... is also motherly, ma'am. As motherly as anyone. Of course, I've told him so many times. He slipped up, he's only a boy. Please forgive him. We need to have a talk. - What is your name? - Elena. Leave it to me, Brother Venancio. He's in my class. A very good student. Onward, squadrons, to victory, that a new day dawns on Spain! - Spain! - United! - Spain! - Great! - Spain! - Free! Long live Franco! - Onward Spain! - Onward! He slipped up, it won't happen again. Don't worry, it's nothing serious. At his age, the poor thing, it can't be malice. Of course not. - Believe me, Brother... - Salvador. That's my real name. Nothing to do with me saving you from the patriotic claws of Brother Venancio. - Name? - Lorenzo. No, I meant yours. Elena. How silly of me. Go on, get to class. Elena, we should talk about Lorenzo. I promise he'll learn "Facing the Sun" by heart. I'm sure he'll have no trouble learning anything he needs. He's intelligent. He's a very gifted student. But there's something... strange. Strange? Yes, I don't know. Absences, perhaps. I catch him often in the clouds. Somewhere else. Like sometimes he's there, sometimes he isn't. Do you follow me, Elena? Well, I don't know. It's probably... It's probably shyness. He's still just a boy. You know, his age... And, now that Brother Venancio isn't listening, not at all patriotic. Indifferent. Is there a cause for that? A cause? I don't think a boy his age... No, forgive me. You're right. And he's an exemplary student. His grades, I mean. I know you help him with his homework. Without a father, of course. I'm going to help you. I can dedicate you a little more time. Lorenzo and you deserve it. And from time to time I'll give you an update. To keep you informed. I don't know, we can meet for a snack or go for a stroll. I can come to your home, it you prefer. I don't know. I'm not accustomed to this type of situation. At home, definitely not. Whatever is easiest for you. Think it over and let me know. Yes, of course. If you'll forgive me. - Duty calls. - Of course. My class is waiting. ORIGINAL SIN God let them eat all the fruit except one. And that's precisely the one they ate. Eve came along and offered it to Adam. And Adam bit into the fruit. Look, here it is. Adam's Apple. You see? And at that very moment, God sent in his army of archangels and expelled our first parents from Paradise. He expelled them and he expelled the rest of us forever. No more leisure without work and no more births without pain. War and death came along. And sin penetrated deep into our flesh! You guys want to come over? My mom made a snack! Hooray! - Wow, very nice. - Let me. No, I've only had it for a second. - What's that? - A theater. When I perform the play, they speak. - What do you mean? - Look. "Good morning. I'm a shepherdess. I'm scared of the wolf." What wolf? - Does he kill her? - No way. The hunter turns up and shoots him. Boom! And he dies. Snack time! Hooray! - Anyone hungry? - Yes! When will you sing? Learn! When you finish playing, put your toys away. I know. So what's this doing here? I don't wear it anymore. It's too hot. Then put it away as well. "UNSPEAKABLE FLOCK OF NOCTURNAL BIRDS" Leave me. Bring a glass of water with some sugar. You were saying the sight of that woman troubles you. And her memory. I can't get her out of my mind. I just... She walks away. I watch her leave. And her hips move. Her hips move like... They swing. That's it. They swing. Is she flirting? Do you think she's insinuating? Insinuating? No. I don't think so. I don't know, I'm confused. Maybe I'm the one insinuating. Nothing flagrant, you know. But she dresses provocatively. She wears these tight little dresses that... Right. Things are heating up, is that it? I mean things related to this time of year. Yes, but since I didn't have... How can I say? Peremptory contact... frequent, normal, you might say... with sin until you sent me to war... What you're going through comes with age, not war. Whatever you say. But I hoped that, back at the seminary, this would end... and I'd be freed from this nightmare. Why should you be freed? The devil never rests. It's his business. Yes, but I think I'm using the weapons religion provides us. I want to see every woman as Eve, mother of us all, before sin. Or as martyrs, who let themselves be ripped apart by lions without losing their virtue. That's not a good path, son. You won't find any Eves in the street. We do agree that none of them walk around naked... You're the one who undresses them with your eyes... And as far as martyrs go, forget about it. You risk becoming a lion the first time you slip up. The confessionary is enlightening. You'll see. What can I do? Take the devil by the horns, boy. I'm afraid that she will win the game, Father. It looks more to me like, in the game you're playing, you're the board, the chips and the dice. Don't you see it? Come on, let's get some air. We can breathe out here. Tell me, this Elena... How did you meet her? She's a widow. The mother of a student. An intelligent boy, a bit withdrawn, shy perhaps... Sometimes he's there, sometimes he isn't... Silent, doubtful... - Something of a rebel. - The mother... She brings him to school. That's when I see her. She brings the boy, stays for the flag raising, sings "Facing the Sun"... Well, not exactly, the other day Brother Venancio... The mother... She also picks him up after. The scene repeats itself. The kids line up outside, they sing, they're dismissed... And when they leave, her hips swing as she walks. Yes, they swing. And I tense up. Son, you tense up... because you look at her. You can't take your eyes off her. And the only cure for that is facing the devil himself. If you don't do that, we can give up and go home. - What if I can't? - What do you mean by can't? You think you can run away from it and hide at the seminary? It won't be any help. Because there isn't a wall, barrier or trench that lust can't pass through. You got that? That's what your problem is called: Lust. Are you going to give in? Never! What would be of the flock, of the faithful, if the shepherds of the Church, and future shepherds in training... were to run from the wolf instead of fighting him? Temptation hurts more than sin. Because sin ends in forgiveness. But temptation is constant, never-ending. Can't you see how artfully God administers pain? You are on this earth to defeat everything: the Devil, the flesh and yourself. Especially yourself. After that, Salvador... After that, my son, you return to the seminary, not to hide, but to say mass. Triumphant. Undefeated. I've always wanted to ask you... - I'm curious to know. - Yes, Father. Have you ever seen Franco - up close? - Yes, once. And he smiled at me! - Spain! - United! - Spain! - Great! - Spain! - Free! Long live Franco! Onward Spain! - I'll drop you here. - Why? I have to turn this in. Go on. You'll be late. I see we're both late. Yes. I was just thinking about you. Wait here a moment. I'll be right back. I can't. I have to take this to Bujanda Clothing. I'll walk with you. Father. Father. What is it? A toothache. I couldn't sleep. Can I go to the dentist? A toothache? If your teeth were anything like mine... Go on, don't be long. No, Father. Thank you. Do you also think it's wrong if I have breakfast alone? No. Why would I? From now on I'm having breakfast last. Alone. With no one else. And tell Brother Enrique to cover your class! "My mother's name is Elena. She's a great cook and she can sew and embroider. Sometimes when she cries she hides so I won't see her." Watchman! Watchman! Watchman! Dad, Mom, they're coming up. Go to bed and stay there. Coming! Coming! Who is it? Police! Open up! Let's go. Sit down. Here we are again. Any news from that bastard husband of yours? We have some. He's in France. Happy to hear that? In Toulouse. Safe. The bad news... for you, I mean... is he's living with a whore. You drink? My cousin brought it. At Christmas. Drink. Go on, drink. Come on, get out of there. Come out of there! Any news of your daughter? We have some. She ran off with her boyfriend, the Communist playing revolutionary poet. I'm talking to you. Look at me. We'll catch them. We will. - Let go of my son! - Enough! For my mother. She likes them. Wait outside. The Toulouse part was a joke. But take this seriously. Your bastard husband got the guillotine for robbery and murder. He was robbing banks. Don't let it get you down. You're a free woman now, you should be glad we're here. You want a look at the boys? You can take your pick. It's your loss. The window. I don't want to go to school. Why not? He says there's a new priest bugging him. He keeps asking me stuff. Like when you died, if I have brothers or sisters... He asks everybody that, right? No. Come here. What did you tell him? First I said I didn't know. Then I said you got killed by the Reds. And that Mom goes to mass. And that I'm going to be an aviator. But he says it's better being very Spanish and very Christian and being a priest is best of all. Right. - Don't listen to him. - Come on. Get your bag. - I don't want to go. - Come on. Dad... Dad has lots of problems. You have to be strong to help him. Because you must never, ever lose faith. Get to class. What a coincidence! Yes, isn't it? I went to the dentist. I had a toothache. - How are you? - Fine, thank you very much. I'm sorry. About the dentist, I mean. I'll walk with you. That way we can discuss Lorenzo. Since the other day you didn't wait for me... I didn't know how long you would take. I'm always in a hurry. Housekeeping and errands... That's why I want to take care of Lorenzo personally. I don't know if he'd accept. He's very attached to me... He could use a man close by. Because your husband was killed, I believe... Yes, he was caught in a Republican zone when the war began. I mean a Red zone. In a Red zone. Have you thought of giving Lorenzo an education? Yes, of course. I suppose it's not easy for you. I mean you might have financial difficulties. I could help you with that as well. Would you like an ice cream? - An ice cream? - Come on. What flavor? Two. One vanilla... At this time of day? Do you like vanilla? Both of them vanilla. I was saying I would help you. I could get Lorenzo a scholarship. He could study for free at the seminary. Lorenzo at the seminary? I can't promise he'll make Pope, but imagine him someday as a canon, a bishop, a cardinal, who knows? Lorenzo has no vocation. Well, we have to dig... Because digging deep enough... I didn't either, and yet I found it. - You don't like it? - Yes. Very much. Lorenzo is still young. I'd never considered it. Well, you should. You should. Well, I've arrived. If it's quick, I can wait for you. I'm skipping class this morning. No, don't trouble yourself. Discussing the seminary in the street like this doesn't seem right... Thank you anyway. I'll think about it. I'll talk to Lorenzo. Good morning, Carmiña. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Can I help you? That woman. Where was she going? Elena? She helps out. She sews for the clothing shop. - Why? - No reason. I thought she was visiting someone. A man I know who lives here. My mistake, that's all. Good morning. "I was an Adventuress." "Four. Seriously dangerous." Then I win the bet. Give me the cards. Oh, God! You, you, you and you. Let's go to the movie. - What about me? - You didn't have any cards. Well, come anyway. That way you'll learn from the movie. - Where are you going? - To the movie! Don't get dirty, your mom will yell at me! Come on, Mariana. We'll be better over here. We can lay in the grass. No, stop it... Give me a kiss. I've never kissed a man. But you said you love me. Yes, but that has nothing to do with it. - You'll leave me after. - I swear I won't. Okay, but just one. She kissed him. No, Fernando... Not that... He's got her in the grass. Now he lies down on top. Why do they lie down? Don't you know men and woman lie down because it feels good? And they cry and scream with pleasure. He's eating her alive, huh? Lalo was right. They'll hunt me down like a rabbit. Why do you say that? Don't you understand? That friar, or priest or whatever... The bastard suspects something. No, it's not that. It's something else. Something else? What then? I don't know. He's mystical. Wanting to make Lorenzo a priest... But I'm sure he has no idea you're still alive. "Murdered by the Reds," he said it himself. And the scholarship... Lorenzo isn't going back to that school. No, that would be worse. Then he would definitely investigate and your record would stand out. Besides, it's almost summer vacation. We can find another school next year. It hurts you. The brandy? No, I know what hurts me. I know what's driving me crazy. Those sons of bitches hunting and shooting me down! They want to kill me for what I think. That's what hurts me, a hell of a lot more than the brandy! I can't go on living in this hole. Why should I? And I'm not translating any more of this damn wolfram just so that bastard Hitler can rule Europe. And nobody's going to turn my son into a priest, goddamn it! - Ricardo! - Goddamn it! Holy shit. Salvador, the famous second lieutenant. I knew you were in the seminary but seeing you dressed like a priest with your hair combed nice... I'm really overwhelmed. Do I have to call you Father? - No, I'm still a deacon. - When will you say mass? Next year, God willing. No, thanks. I don't drink. Cigar? I don't smoke either. As you see, I drink, I smoke, in peace and at war, the vices never change. However, though you'll find it hard to believe, I read now and everything. Look. There you have it. A great poet. Doesn't even need to be a faggot. José María Permán. A good writer. I'm no pushover, and at times he makes me cry. How do you celebrate saying mass? Like a wedding? - No. - First Communion? - Or a funeral? - No. - No, I'm just kidding around. - Sure. I know it's not a wake. Want me to send flamenco dancers? Knock it off already. You were always in brothels... Who, me? And now with the collar... Come in! Thank you. Let's see. Quite a character, this... Ricardo Mazo Torralba. Professor of Literature at the local high school... Mason... Affiliated with Republican Left. Why are you interested in him? I teach at an elementary school. One of my students is his son. He died, right? "Disappeared in July of 1936." His wife says the Reds killed him. That's very odd. What about his wife... my student's mother? Anything? "...his partner, Elena López Reinares..." Which means a civil wedding... "Two children..." Two children? "Elena, born in 1922, lover of Communist poet Eulalio Peciña, both at large with warrants out for their arrest... and Lorenzo, born in 1933..." Neither of them is baptized. No. Though I think it's insane, stay in here if you want. But you have to eat. We can't go on like this. It's Lorenzo. May I come in? Sorry. It's the heat. One moment. It's the priest! What can I do for you? It's about Lorenzo. But I told you, my son has no vocation. And I've found out something even more troubling. Troubling? I don't understand. Could I please have a glass of water? Of course. Excuse me. My blood pressure is a bit low. Do you have any wine? Wine? - No, I don't have wine. - Well. - Brandy? - Even better. Left over from Christmas. A cousin of mine brought it. Lorenzo told me he was an only child. But I know he has a sister. Well, yes. But she doesn't live with us. I also know neither of them are baptized. And that the girl and her lover are wanted by the police. And that your husband was a Red, a mason and a Republican. A real gem! Are you aware that if Lorenzo dies... It's just an example, God forbid... ...he would be damned to Hell for all eternity? I was going to have him baptized. Don't justify yourself. I understand. There is no evil in your face, Elena. I understand you and I sympathize. What you must have been through. What a hell. A mason Republican who wouldn't let you baptize your kids. A daughter who runs off with a Communist poet. You're a martyr. Poor thing. How do you know all that? I know everything. But you can rest easy now, because you have me. I'll baptize Lorenzo and prepare him for his first Communion. I'll make you some coffee. Good idea. While I visit the bathroom. I'll show you where. In any case, I want you to know that if he changes his mind, that's fine. He can leave the seminary. Even me, about to say my first mass, and I'm going through a crisis. I'm disoriented, like blind sunflowers, the Bible would say. I don't even know if I want to be a priest anymore. You're not a priest? No, a deacon. Just a deacon. Of a high order. The final one before saying mass. The bathroom. Who knows? Someday I might even find somebody to have a family with. There's no coffee. There's none left. I'm very grateful for everything you're doing. I'll talk to Lorenzo, that's all I can say. Does he know you've already got a man around? Give me that. What are you thinking? What should I think? A woman like you, young and alone... You obviously don't know much about women. Nobody ever told you that women shave their legs in summertime? You shave your...? Of course. Like everyone else. Look, like this. You see? They're smooth, light... but firm as iron. Don't. Please, don't. Don't go on, please. It's Lorenzo! We still need to discuss your daughter. What was he doing here? Nothing. Talking. - What did the priest want? - He's not a priest, he's a deacon. Where will we go? And how? We'll leave Lorenzo with your Aunt Lola. You're not leaving me with anyone. Yes, sweetie... Aunt Lola has a moustache that pricks me. Drop it, you two. All three of us are leaving. Where, Ricardo? Where? Portugal. With Elenita and Lalo. We'll travel by bus. From village to village. On short trips they don't ask for papers. With what money? The furniture, typewriter, books... We'll sell it all. Mom, we're late. You're not going to school. Never again? Never again. What about Brother Salvador? - Brother Salvador can go to... - Ricardo, please. Come in. Hail Mary, mother of God. What is it now? A student is missing from my class. I fear something might have happened. And? Well, I thought maybe I should go and check on him. You'll never learn. Always looking for an excuse to go for a stroll. This is your last warning, young man. If you don't show more interest in performing your duties, I'll send you back to the seminary. Anyway, that student you mentioned... Is his name Lorenzo Mazo? Yes, Father. He's ill. Tonsilitis. Go back to class. You've neglected it enough as it is... Why are these books hidden? Because if the police find them, they'll burn them. Look. This one is by Antonio Machado. He had to run away too. "To my friend and comrade, Ricardo Mazo. Warmest regards, Antonio Machado." "Stay away from hopeless love, prudish love, without danger, blindness or adventure, that expects of love a true token, because in love madness makes sense. Love whose breast rejects a blind infant and cursed life's fire. From a flame imagined, never lit, he seeks ashes to keep the fire going. And ashes he will find, not from its flame, when people hear his clumsy ravings asking for fruit from a branch yet to flower. With a dark key time shall open before him its cold chamber. Deserted bed, cloudy mirror and empty heart." Did you like it? You didn't get it. You will. What did Brother Salvador say? I didn't see him. You won't regret this? Of course I will. But what can I do, leave them here? Ferrandiz might report me. For giving him dedicated first editions? His greed will overcome his fear of getting caught. They're good people. Asturians. Plenty of cleanliness and a great bean stew. - Expensive? - They may not charge you. They're very Catholic. Second floor on the left. - Watchman! - Coming! DEATH ON THE PORTUGUESE BORDER Halt! Halt! Halt! Halt! Ricardo, are you in there? Yes. Have you finished the list of books? Hold on. Yes. I'll be right out. How do I look? You look beautiful. What do I tell Ferrandiz? Tell him you're moving away and you can't take my books with you. But... Lorenzo isn't here. My son isn't here. So what? I told the Rector you would beat me at this game. What's the problem with me helping you and your son? I would leave everything for you! What? That's insanity. Insanity you provoked. What are you doing? Brother Salvador, I've done nothing. Think about it. What are you doing? What are you doing? No, no, no... You can't do this. Please, you can't! - I'm going to marry you. - You can't. Because I'm a free man. I can go back to the army. Please, no... - Please, no... - I know you want me. You're screaming for it! No! No! No! Let go of her, son of a bitch! - Get off him! - Don't hit him! Who is this man? He's my father, son of a bitch! Call the police! There's a Red in here! - A Communist! Call the police! - Please! - There's a Red hiding in here! - Please! Stop! There's a Red in here! Call the police! No! What's wrong, Mommy? Ricardo! She came to me acting needy, and with her treachery, she fooled me completely. She fooled you? Without a doubt. She didn't need me to be a father to her son or to support her family. She acted weak to allure me and she hooked me like a trout. If it wasn't to be a part of her family... Totally impossible, given the circumstances... ...what did she want from you? Who knows? To make her feel desired, or to use me to cover up any suspicion about her husband's whereabouts... Maybe it was lust. That may be the easiest explanation. I'm sure that if he hadn't been there, she would have slept with me. What about you? Are you at all to blame? I should have figured it out. I don't know. The boy's contradictions, and her lies... I'm not going back to the seminary. I won't say mass. I'll try to be a good Christian outside of priesthood. Don't be hasty, Salvador. Give it time. Do you think it was wrong for me to report them? To call for help? He was a Red, Father. A Red who refused to baptize his kids, who hadn't been married in a church, who helped his daughter run away and drove her to her death... Take it easy, son. Take it easy. I don't know if I'm a good Christian. Actually, I know I'm not. But I know I'm a good Spaniard. And that Red, killing himself, was only trying to blame me for the impulse that made him jump. But I didn't want that... All right. Come here, son. Come here. As penitence, you'll say your breviary on your knees for the next three years.
