Death be not proud Though some have called thee Mighty and dreadful For thou art not so One short sleep past We wake eternally And death shall be no more Death, thou shalt die Ugh. I told Charlie it was over. You wouldn't dare, would you, Vinnie? Kassie, do you want some candy? Or do you prefer cold turkey... Thick sliced? Hey Eddie, how's the plantation? I'm making the desert bloom, Cal. Goddamn. What gets you up with the sun? I don't know how you did all this with one arm, man, I couldn't have done it with two. Just tell me why you're here. Look, Kassie was arrested last night. She had an eight-gram deck of Bart Simpson in her pocket. The arresting officer recognized her and brought her to me. Kassie would die before she touched that shit. She must have been carrying for someone else. Eddie, I saw the track marks on her arms. Now, I tore up the charge sheet. I tried to bring her out here, but she jumped out the car at the red light and disappeared. Who's the balloon? When she was arrested, she was alone. I mean, I could put some time in if you want. Eddie? You stupid, useless fuck. You killed everything that ever mattered. I want you to die. Do you understand me? I want you to die. I want you to fucking die. Bella's raising hell, she wants the camera. Take it. Send Kassie up to my room. She don't look too proud now. I said, take it. It was pure number four when it left Hong Kong. That's as far as my guarantee extends. Hey, Leo, I know I'm new to this game, but don't treat me like a fucking asshole. From now on I'm handling things stateside. This problem won't arise again. Charlie, conflict is bad for business. You have our apologies and our new guarantee. You also asked me for a favor. These were much more difficult to find than I anticipated... and more expensive. We've been running a blackmail scam out of the Patpong girly bars for many years. Child prostitutes and American tourists, we have the supply, you have the demand. It's a white boy getting a blowjob, so what? Look again, Vincent. Add a decade to the face. How much? Accept them as a goodwill gift from your friends. Well, tonight... we've scheduled a little entertainment, which I hope will repay the favor. What do you mean too tired? I was hired for two cum shots and that last one was it. And it was a monster, I might add. Well, that was the three-way dyke scene you're only supposed to watch. I don't watch, lady, I fuck. And dyke stuff is for faggots, take it from an all-American. I had to go with the truth of the scene. They wanted me, I felt it. You ever heard of going with the moment, the method? You know, Strasberg and Stravinsky? It wasn't in the script, Marlon. When the script gives me nothing to work with, I have to write the character. Well, you just wrote yourself a brand new ending. You're fired. Now fuck off! Hey Bella, how's it going? Jeff thinks we're doing a thinks we're doing a remake of On the Waterfront, otherwise fine. Hopefully, this shit'll cut together later. Where's the pride in your craft? I left it in New Jersey in a rat hole not unlike this one. Charlie, this bitch is breaking my balls, man. I'm not used to being treated this way. I know you're not, Jeff, honey. In Shaving Private Ryan,he was taking high protein enemas from a squad of Nazi storm troopers. He's a better actor than you give him credit for. He looked like he was really enjoying it. Oh, and when you're finished in here, leave the rig and put the camera in the other room behind the mirror. It's a little home movie, consenting adults only. Jeff, let's see some wood, huh? Hello? Eddie? Kassie, where are you? It's going to be okay, sis, just let me come and get you. Eddie, I'm so sorry. I'm just so sorry. Come home, Kassie. I can't do that. We've been through worse things than this together, but if you stay in that goddamn city it'll burn you down so far, you'll never come back up again. Let me bring you home. Are you still there? Kassie? I'm here. Just tell me where you are and I'll come and get you right now. I can't do that. I can get a doctor. I have to go. Kassie, wait. I love you, big brother. See you later, Eddie. Who is this? You called him Eddie. You know him. I know a lot of people. I'm leaving, Charlie, I've had enough. I... I own the pink slip on your life, baby. I say, "Suck my cock," you get down on your knees. I say, "Fuck a dog with yellow fever," you spread your legs and you bark. Why should I give two shits what you say? You want me to invite Eddie down here? You see, angel, in a world where men screw children... what else is there for a girl to do... except get high? She's a survivor. She's been using for months. Why the emergency? Why the emergency? Because I served that cesspool of a city for 15 years and never so much as took a free turkey at Christmas. Now I've got one arm, a pension and a cage to count the hours in. Maybe I'm nobody, but I want my sister safe. The department owes me that, and even if they don't, you do. I'll talk to the captain. We'll both talk to the captain. Eddie, she might call here again. She might show up. Stay here. Remember... I don't have your patience. Now, why you stopped smiling, huh? Smile for Daddy. Smile for your daddy. Going somewhere, madam? I need to go to the bathroom. You... You are nothing. You feel nothing. You want nothing. You are nothing. So... nothing matters, right? Can you get me out of here? I mean now. Charlie doesn't like when first timers cheat on a deal. Personally I don't blame him. No, you don't understand. No, I think I understand well enough. Please help me. Oh, shit. Looks like we both had a pretty tough day, huh? Let's go. Party's upstairs, Kassie. It's so easy to get lost in this place. If you want a ride, just say so. Look, whatever you said that you'd do for them, they have no right to keep you here. Listen, when we need a lawyer, we'll give you a call. Go scare some schoolgirls, Vincent. Do you want to leave or not? I took a wrong turn. You sure? You bitches finished? Kassie? I took a wrong turn. Go home and feed your cats. Stop it! Pre-Noh style. Very special... very rare. No, no. No, no! No, no, no! I didn't know gooks were so big on ink. I told you to go feed your cats. That girl, Kassie, she was scared. I want to know what's... Get the fuck out of here. You know I don't know if this is actually the best time to open up my heart to you, but the actual truth is I've kind of had a real crush on you ever since Charlie dug you up. You don't believe me? Seriously, yes. Can't you see us together? I mean I think we make a great couple. Do you like chocolate? Ahh! Ohh! I lost her. Well, go up to her apartment, clear it out, anything that might connect us. One number at the Public Safety Communication Center. All 911 operators are currently handling calls. Please... Now, we've all got debts to pay. Sorry, Kassie. Do it. Yeah? Hey, Eddie, you're still awake? I thought you cripples went to bed early. I hope you believe in a forgiving God, because now it's time for the redemption of sin. Where's Kassie? She wanted to spend some time with her parents. I'd hobble on down there, if I were you, right now. Kassie! You did a remarkable job getting her here alive. She was in respiratory arrest. How is she now, doc? Well, she's breathing on her own again. If it wasn't for her tolerance she would have died instantly. What are her chances? Of survival? Excellent. But she is still in a coma. It's too early for MRI scans and we won't know if there's any residual neurological deficit until she regains consciousness. Was she abused? I'd like a minute alone with my sister. Hello, Bella. Mr. Burns? Yeah? How is she, Eddie? Alive. Well, there's always next time. What do you want? Well, I got what I want, cripple, I got you shitting blood. Cut to the chase. You sinned, Eddie, and you're going to pay. In this world and the next. I'm going to take you on a slow march through hell. When you want to dance, you let me know, otherwise stop wasting my time. Someone wants to hear me scream, Cal? Who? I don't know. I want a 24-hour guard on Kassie's room. Check the files, find out who's got the motive, the patience, the imagination. You run that license plate? Bella Schuman. I got people checking her apartment. Where you going? Home. No guards, no surveillance. I want him to come to me. Eddie... This isn't your job anymore. I just made it my job. If you don't want to help, stay out of my way. No, no! No, no! Yeah? Two thumbs up, Eddie? Or maybe in your case I should say...one. You enjoy the show? I've seen worse. Have you? See that's the difference between you and me, Kingfish. Whatever you've seen, I've seen worse. And whatever you've done, I've done worse. And what's keeping me warm inside is knowing that whatever I did to you, I hurt you real bad. Listen to me, half-man... You want me? Good. You bring all the muscle you can get. But take my advice, I won't be reading anyone their rights, and I won't be taking prisoners. That's some heavy shit, Ed. Damn, man, this shit is beyond pale, Ed. Man, who is she? My sister. Oh, Jesus, Eddie. This is cut so we're only meant to see Kassie's face, not the animals in there with her. That's right, I don't see them. Fast forward. Ah, there, they missed one. Let's just see who you are, motherfucker. Hey, hold up. Wait a minute. Yeah, there's somebody else here, Ed. Can't see his face, but... Here you go. Hey Ed, man, you need some help with this, I know some people that'll do these motherfuckers, gratis. I'm going to take care of them. Thanks, brother. Hey, no problem. I saw tats like this in the '80s in Bangkok. These symbols are a lucky charm. Face looks Thai too. Smack peddlers? I don't know. I'll try to get these ID'd. Captain. Eddie. Cal called me at home last night. I'm sorry. How is she? Still unconscious. Targeting a former officer is unusual, in fact, it's almost unknown. Whoever did this has to know that we'll throw everything we've got at them. Intelligent psychopath with brass balls. It won't matter what they're made of once I've got my hand on them. We'll bring these animals in, Eddie. I'll put every other case on the back burner until we do. But hear me now. I'll say this only once: You're not a cop. Not anymore. You have no authority from this department. There's another side of that coin, captain. This department has no authority over me. How many men would it take to get him into a cell? I figure no more than five or six if you include me and you. Oh, hell, let's call it protective custody. When you took the catbird seat, captain, there were a lot of people in this building who wanted to see you fall, and fall hard. Whenever it looked like you might there was one man you could trust who stood by your side. Your loyalty to me, Eddie, doesn't mean I can let you break the law. I wasn't planning to ask your permission. You didn't ask last time either. Well then, that makes us even. The moment anything breaks, you'll be the first to know. Thanks. And Eddie, thanks for keeping my poor old ass perched in the catbird seat. You're welcome. Only a son of a bitch would want it. So where's our friend, Mr. Lakorn? At his motel. Too much whisky last night. Head sick. No, they'd be disappointed. Vincent and I thought that you should make a little more each day, so we laid on another adventure. Thorazine. Should be out for a couple of more hours. Vincent will recommend somewhere a little quieter. You see Leo, there are places in this state that could be on the dark side of the moon. We'd very much prefer it if she didn't come back. Jesus Christ, what the fu...?! Don't tell me I fucked you, too, last night? You should be so lucky, Conrad. Those sheets cost me 300 bucks, man. Cressida's hair-dressing bill is going to break me. Oh, jeez. I haven't even had my morning fatty... You don't mind if I skin one up, do you Eddie? Help yourself. I can't think straight when I'm straight. There we go. You disappointment me, Conrad, I thought you were a pitcher. Age does terrible things to the libido. A man's got to seek new horizons. I thought they'd farmed you out to pasture, man? I know guys who celebrated for two whole weeks. What's the beef? Burns. Yeah, we lucked out with the photo. Face works for the Thai Trade Delegation in L.A., name of Lakorn. U.S. Customs had their eye on him, some suspected smuggling scam, never found out what it was. Now get this, he's got diplomatic immunity. Where's he staying? At the XXX Motel, I'll be there in 30... And wait for me. I'm looking for some people who abducted and raped a girl, her name is Kassie. Who is she? She's... A dope addict. Eddie, smack ain't for me these days, or crack. I put all that shit behind me, I swear. Just grass now. Okay, maybe a little coke. I'm Mr. Clean, man, I'm Mr. Happy. I just want to see everybody have a good time. You know what I'm saying? Well, okay Mr. Happy, I want you to check out the dealers, the jugglers and the thoroughbreds. Especially anyone with Thai connections. I want to know who was supplying her and who she was hanging out with. Eddie, that's not my scene, man, that's not my scene at all. Those guys are pure fucking poison. I... I'll see what I can do, okay? Can I keep this? Yeah. I also want a line on a New Yorker, Bella Schuman. Thirties, black hair about so long, good-looking, wears leather. That's it? This is Reno, not Waco. Half the waitresses in town look like that. So get dressed and get to work. Eddie, you ever tried taking common courtesy for a spin? Maybe you knock on the door instead of breaking in? Maybe a gentle tap on the shoulder instead of the bloody mary wakeup call? Just a little politesse, man, you know what I'm saying? Please, Conrad, get the fuck to work. Kind of... Brody. Yeah, we need to talk, lieutenant. Who the fuck is we? About your service days in Bangkok. Huh, in the '80s, you remember, don't you, Cal? R&R in the Patpong Row. You the cocksucker working over Eddie Burns? I hear you got two little daughters. It must be hard for a man like you to resist. Who is this? Speaking of cocksuckers, I'm looking at a picture of a 12-year-old girl with a U.S. government-issue hard-on in her mouth. Gee, lieutenant, I wonder if it could be yours? Sammy's Lounge, 15 minutes or I e-mail a hi-res JPEG of this Hallmark moment to your wife, your kid's school and the entire Reno police. Captain... You look as if you've just swallowed a large poisonous insect. Yes, sir. That's what enables me to work 17-hour days. I eat them instead of donuts. The time I protected Eddie and kept Internal Affairs and the DA off his back... It's been on my mind. Sir? Eddie's last case before retiring, the boy who hung himself in his cell, Kraken, Marty Kraken. Yeah, cop killer. You and Eddie made the collar together. You figure there might be a connection with what they did to Kassie? Kraken was a low-life, a punk, a nobody. As far as we could tell, he wasn't connected to anyone... No family, no mob ties. Whoever's leaning on Eddie is hardcore. What did Eddie do to the Kraken kid? That kid blew Tommy Mullen away with a 12-gauge shotgun. A lot of guys would have shot the punk on the spot and claimed a citation for valor. We made him shit in his pants, so what? We told him how many blowjobs he'd be giving per hour at Lovelock, so what? That he laid one horrible beating on him that night, so what? What's a jerk-off cop killer suicide got to do with finding the psychos out there now? Maybe you should lay off those insects, Cal. Yeah, well, I need to be somewhere. We live with the dregs, lieutenant. We talk to them, we touch them. We smell what they had for dinner. We see how they squander the lives God gave them. And if we become contaminated, we squander our lives, too. The rules that we follow, the rules I insist we follow... protect us, you and me and Eddie... Not them. That's the "so what." And if you're already contaminated? If you've got something to tell me, Cal, there's no better time than right now. I got a lead on the Thais, I told Eddie he could come along with me. Just remember who's the one with the badge. What do you want? Oh, oh, you want trouble? Ahh! Ahh! What do you want? I saw a photo of you this morning. You were laughing. That's my sister. Yeah. Let me hear you laugh now. Come on! Let me hear you laugh. Let me hear you laugh, huh? Come on, big man, huh, laughing boy? You have fun? You take turns making her scream? The guy with the tattoo? The tattoo. His name? Thamaree. What? Thamaree. Where's he staying? The El Royal Motel. Who's the guy who set this up, the American? The man who set this up, who is he? I have diplomatic immunity. I'm trying to be diplomatic. No, stop it! Please! Police, I'm looking for Mr. Thamaree. Did you realize, Vincent, that but for our vigilance, copies of that photo would be circulating right now on the World Wide Web. Friends in need, Charlie. Friends indeed. There are 500,000 pedophiles in North America, Cal. They consume 85 percent of the world's kiddie porn. Imagine what it must feel like having that many scumbags jerking themselves off over your image. All right, I don't have to listen to this shit, you're a sick motherfucker. Sick? I'm sorry, lieutenant, do you know what that is she has in her mouth and who it belongs to? Listen asshole, I was 22 years old, I got shitfaced on Mekong whiskey and Thai stick. Fuck the teenage hooker. If I wanted, I could do the same thing two blocks down the street. But it was a one-off and when I woke up I threw my guts up. We understand, Cal. We're not judging you, but other people... Other people. Captain Oakes. Your lovely wife. Eddie Burns. What did Eddie do to you? Eddie has sinned. God may plan to punish Eddie in the next world, but I intend to punish him in this one, and you're going to help me. I'll help you. I'll help you scrape your brains off the wall. And all of those e-mails of your private parts and it's... It's just as well you carry such a big handgun, Cal, because I couldn't use you in any of my pictures. They're set to fly in an hour. If you run, you can make the airport. Who are you? I'm a man offering you a chance to redeem yourself. You do want to redeem yourself, don't you? Don't you? Oh, by the way, you remember a kid called Marty Kraken? Hung himself with a sheet in one of your cells? You remember him? Marty was my brother. Vincent here will tell you what to do. It's Tommy Mullen. Shotgun. Eddie, wait for backup! Eddie, that's enough! Cop killer! Cal, watch out! Eddie! Ahh! Thamaree! Thamaree! Bella, it's Eddie Burns. Can he understand me? I don't think so. Do exactly as I say. Count off 10 seconds, turn to the back door and shout my name like I'm there. Thamaree! Thamaree! Ah! I wanted to keep this one alive for a while. Guess you're going to have to tell me who I'm looking for. You got things to tell me? Have you any idea what they were going to do to me? Yes, I do. Have you? Don't you get tired of being so tough? Don't you ever take a break? Those scum are your friends, baby, not mine. Hey, I have been drugged, kidnapped and driven through the desert in a trunk of a fucking rental car, and forced to watch you blow two men apart. The last part I am willing to forgive, but I will not have you call me baby, is that clear? Here. There's more in the cooler if you need it. Conrad? Edwardo, my boy. Yeah, this Kassie chick was seen leaving a club early hours yesterday morning with a dealer, name of Grady White. Where can I find him? On a life support machine in Washoe County Hospital, brain dead on arrival. My guess is the guys you want are the guys that gave Grady the bad haircut. Well, thanks anyway. Oh, oh, oh, politesse, man, politesse. Well done, well done. Say, Bella Schuman, that's two you owe me for, she directs B-grade porn. Two chicks lick each other out and then find a basketball team in the closet, that kind of stuff. Who for? For the likes of us, I guess. The film company, Conrad, the producers. It seems she was an avant-garde filmmaker in New York City, and we don't know who she directs the porn for. Find out. Eddie, I have done my good deed for the day. I'm swamped here, I gotta get back to work. I'd forgotten something could be so beautiful. Yeah, it must be a nice change from filming gangbangs in cheap motels. Hey, I made my deal with this messed up world. I never broke the law and I never hurt anyone. You mean anyone like Kassie? Do you think I'm responsible for what happened to her? You ran out on me at the hospital. I didn't want to wind up dead. So why'd you try to help her? Maybe because I know what it's like to be a piece of meat thrown to a pack of dogs. Who tried to kill my sister? I won't tell you. I figured you for guts, Bella. Yeah, well figure me for brains too, Eddie. You didn't see what they did to Kassie. Who are they? I film gangbangs, Eddie. Goods don't come any more soiled than me. God, the lawyers would take me apart on the witness stand if they didn't whack me before the trial. There's not going to be a trial. I'm going back to New Jersey. I'm sorry, I can't help you. Oh no, you want to talk some more about beauty before you go? Get out of my way. You don't get off that easy. Take your fucking hands off of me. What? What? I kept Kassie alive. Where were you when she needed you? I want his name! I want a name! Go to hell! His name! Fuck you! His name! His name! His name! No! No! Why not? Because this is wrong! Because you don't scare me. Because I know you're not like them. They're Kassie's. That bother you? Yeah? The guy we want's a scumbag, makes porno films, name of Charlie Strom. Yeah, I've never heard of him either, but he's got a hard-on to make you scream. Wants to see you tonight, just you and him. Sounds like the guy's been watching one too many Westerns. Yeah, I hear you. But listen, legally Strom's clean. If you want to nail him, this is the only way. Be at Jansen's Gas and General at 9:15. You'll be contacted there. 9:15, got it. Did you tell the captain? No. Thanks, partner. Hey, just let me know where to find the bodies. You should work for us full-time, lieutenant. Keep him here until 11. You got it. And why don't you buy yourself another? It's Eddie, Kassie. You're safe, you're safe now. He kept calling me. He bought me flowers, Charlie did. He told me it was just coke. Just one line, just one little line, that's all. I knew you'd hate me. No, that's not true. No, I knew, I knew. And then I knew what it was. It was this cradle... rocking me to sleep... and it made everything okay again. Mama... Papa... Everything. I tried to run away, but I couldn't, and... Listen to me, Kassie. And believe me. I don't care what you've done or who you did it with. I only care that you're safe and that you get well. I love you. I'll always love you, no matter what you do or where you go, I'll love you. They hurt me. I know. They hurt me. They won't hurt you again. They'll never hurt you again, I promise. There's no one in the store. It's only me. Can I help? I'm meeting a friend. Out here? I'm an outdoors type. Ooh. It's a dying breed. You want some coffee while you wait? Sure, why not? Thanks. You know, I'm tired. I'm so fucking tired. I know what you mean. You know, you work all your life to get where you wanna get, and like that, it's gone. You look back through the photo album, that kid who was you, on the football team, he's gone. The girl who you took to Mexico, who you swore you'd love forever, she's gone. The friends who said they'd stick by you until the end. The wife and the kids she took away. Bank loan, business, house on the hill... gone. Castles made of sand, man, that's all we fucking build. Castles made of sand. We're in the right place for that. And what's your story? No choice, no prospects, no future. The past I try to forget about, except when I'm drunk. And why would you want to forget it? One day you turn around and you realize... you're only the man you are, and not the man you wanted to be. And what man was that? Oh, it was so long ago, it's hard to remember. It had something to do with working the land, raising a family, having people smile at you when you walked into a room. But I came to a fork in the road and made the wrong turn. It doesn't look like I'll have time to go back. It's never too late to change. Only if you include being dead. Well, that's the one thing we can count on. Yeah, sometimes that thought is a comfort. You're Burns, right? Saint Francis Xavier Church, 10:00, come alone. Thanks for the coffee. It was nice talking with you. Yeah? Cal, Saint Francis Xavier Church, 10:00. You sure you don't want me to back you up? No, brother, stay at home. I'm Eddie Burns. I come to dance with Charlie Strom. I'm Charlie Strom. I'm Charlie Strom. I'm Charlie Strom. Ugh. Aah! Motherfucker. Hold him, hold him up! Iam Charlie Strom. Go! You still don't know what this is about, do you Eddie? You still don't know who I am. Cal sends his apologies. Arm. Deep breath, Eddie. You've seen the trailer, Eddie. Now here's the director's cut. You fucked up my life. You killed everything that ever mattered. I want you to die, do you understand me? I want you to die. You're not drinking? I've had enough. Are you drinking? Yeah, why not? You mother... Stop, please! Please, stop! She was tight, Eddie. Now, that's how come she screamed so much. How we laughed. Oh, how we laughed. Vincent? Do it. You do want to know why, don't you Eddie, even though you're too fucking stubborn to ask? Nah, that would be too easy. I'll tell you why... in hell. Ahh! Eddie? I told you not to come, Cal. Eddie... It was us, man. It was us. What do you mean? You and me, man, it was us. Who is Strom? Cal? Cal? Who is Strom? I'm sorry. Bella, Strom got away. I need you. Let me get my motherfucking money and get the hell- shit. What's up, man? About the church, um... Kneel. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Just get out of my fucking skull. Leave me alone. Leave me alone, Marty. All right, he's dead. He's dead. Get outta my fucking skull. Leave me alone. Out. Welcome to the funhouse. No, that would be too easy. You tried to kill Kassie. Yeah, that's right. I tortured her... and I shot her full of H. Do you know how long I waited? Do you know how long it took me? You been squirming for your bitch sister for 24 hours. I've been screaming for fucking years! You want to know my real name, Eddie Barnes? It's Kraken, Charlie Kraken. And my little kid brother, his name was Marty. Coming back to you? Now, Marty was a good kid. He weren't too bright, but he was good, he was decent. You had him so scared, he couldn't even remember his own fucking name! Marty was a cop-killer. Marty, he never hurt anybody. His prints were on the murder weapon... So were mine! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie, Charlie, what have you done? Marty get out of the way. Get the fuck away! Get out of my fucking way! Charlie! Freeze! Drop the weapon! Oh, you like killing cops? Eddie stop! Eddie, it's enough! Cop killer! So you see Eddie, I'm your cop killer. I shot a crooked cop. You drove an innocent kid... to suicide. Did you uh... Did you help, huh? Cutting him down? You help untie the sheet from around his fucking neck? Don't you get it, cripple? Don't you get the fucking picture? Perfectly. You let your little brother take the rap for you, but I don't think you see the picture clearly. Marty didn't tie that sheet around his neck because he wanted to. I was there, I made him do it. I watched him die, Charlie, and I laughed while he pissed in his dirty little drawers like a bitch. Oh, how I laughed, Charlie. See, that's the difference between you and I. You have a conscience. That's your sin, not mine. I forgot to load the weapon. Eddie, we've got it. Eddie! Eddie, we don't need this. That kid Marty was innocent. I know. Killed an innocent man. Eddie, now is not the time. Bella, go! Ugh. Breathe out. Ah! Come on. Apply pressure. Okay, I'll be okay. Go. Strom! Ahh! Bye, Eddie. Here we are, brother. Down in hell. Up to our necks in shit. We worked for this all our lives, and we deserve it, but Marty didn't. Clear his name. For both of us. Pull! Forget it. Make it easy on me. Say after me, "Death be not proud." Say it to me. Say it to me, "Death be not proud." Death be not proud Though some have called thee Mighty and dreadful Though some have called thee Mighty and dreadful For thou art not so For thou art not so Captain. What do you expect me to do with this? Put me on trial. Read it, Eddie. You brought down a bunch of smack dealers and pornographers single-handed. If you ran for the governor of Nevada you'd probably win. You're a hero. And Cal Brody? Cal's a hero too. Died in the line of duty. Marty was innocent. You should have considered that possibility before you killed him. I'm going to clear his name, captain. You do what you have to, but the only thing I plan on clearing is my desk. What about the rules? Honesty, integrity, playing it by the book? The rules are for me and my men, they're for cops. I told you this when you started. You're not a cop, not anymore. I'm guilty as sin, captain. Then live with it. Case closed.
