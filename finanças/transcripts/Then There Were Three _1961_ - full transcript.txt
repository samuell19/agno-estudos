During World War II, the German Army was harassed by fierce Italian partisan fighters. Their leader, Il Pellegrino was captured and jailed by the Nazis in the village of San Corrado. A surprise American attack on San Corrado forced the Nazi Army to retreat and in their haste the military prison was abandoned. Aware that the Americans would soon release Il Pellegrino so that he could resume his underground activities, the German high command ordered a Captain Strobel to assume the role of an American solider and to recapture or kill Il Pellegrino at any cost. Yes, right there. Perhaps it would help you to prepare for the mission if you were to speak English. I think you will need an American lighter. We're making an example of a partisan we caught taking information to the enemy. Need I add, Herr Strobel, that I hope the same fate now overtakes you. The general wishes you all success in your enterprise. Let's have a look at the map. Last night, the bulk of the American forces switched over to San Corrado. So when the infantry attack occurred this morning, too late we found out it was only a diversionary tactic. We lost San Corrado at 0600. And at this point, Herr Strobel, you were sent for. I'll have one of my cigarettes if you don't mind, Sergeant. The attack on San Corrado was such a sudden one our men had to leave behind the prisoners we kept in the provincial jail. One of them, unfortunately, was the most important political prize we held in Italy. A leader in the underground, he acted as a liaison between the various Northern Italian partisan groups. Sergeant? Give me the pictures of the Pellegrino. Il Pellegrino. The Americans should start the processing any time now. The prisoners in Il Pellegrino's category will be freed very soon. If this man is released, he will try to head north to continue his activities. Your mission has but one purpose. To prevent his doing so and, if possible, return him to us. To do this, you have become an American infantry man. One of the survivors of today's diversionary tactic. You have your name, case history, and identification. To assist you in joining the American lines, we will give a localized artillery barrage and a small infantry attack. Retreating from Rocca di Paolo, you will find yourself in No Man's Land. From this point, until you arrive in San Corrado, we've tried to minimize the danger from our own forces by adding this little device to your pack. I doubt if you have ever worked with one of these before. It's a most ingenious little radio transmitter powered by batteries which, by the way, should be changed daily. Even now, it is sending out an electronic signal and knowing the wavelength and using triangulation, we are able to keep track of your position and do our best to keep our men out of your path. However, if anybody should get into your way, remember the importance of your mission. You will amazed how closely we can pinpoint the exact location of this transmitter. Well, good luck. Where's Litvack? D Company, Worthcomb, over. Word's come through from San Corrado? Right, the lieutenant should be happy to hear it, sir, only he'd dead. Over. Move what back, sir? The whole company's been shot to pieces. Over. Over and out. Litvack. Hey, Litvack. Is this one of your men, soldier? It's Litvack. Got it when I rounded the turn back there. What's the matter with youse guys? Didn't you get the word? We're pullin' back. Where's your armament, Sergeant? Heads up. Hey, watch it will ya? Sorry, mack. I'm sorry, are you hurt bad? Are you kidding? Are you kidding, mack? You'll never rate a discharge for that. Whatta ya mean, that's serious, I could get infection in there. Yeah, that's right. I tell ya, I'm getting too old for this sort of stuff. Why don't you apply for a transfer? I think I will, take a letter. How the hell did they get around there? You go ask 'em, I'm headin' this way. Wait up. Wait up, mack. You just found a friend. Whatsa matter boy, you hit? I don't know how long they're gonna let us stay here. Just where are we anyway? Well, we're not very close to home but anyway it's a nice, safe place. Somebody's gonna have to get awful lucky to drop one in here. See what I mean? Look, you shouldn't try to hold it in, just let it come out. He was always tellin' me what a lousy soldier I was. How I didn't have him 'round to look after me I'd get myself knocked off first thing. And he was right. Only now he goes and gets himself-- Who's that, kid, your buddy? You lose your buddy? Just back there. We got separated from our outfit and Chuck says we gotta go one way and I say it's another. And so then he gets mad and starts yellin' at me. How'd I ever get stuck with a jerk like you? And then he goes over his way. Just then, I hear this old 88 comin' over and it lands right in front of him. I can see why you'd be so upset. Where'd ya meet up with 'im, over here or back home? Over here. At Salerno last fall. Well that can be rough. I know, I had a brother back in Portland. Four years older than me. Finest guy that ever lived. One day they called from his summer camp and said he was drowned. I'll never forget how I felt when they told me that. It was just like a pile driver hit me. You smoke? You want a cigarette? Yeah, thanks. You're all right. You're takin' it all right, kid. I'm Sam McLease. Thanks, I'm T.I. Ellis. Sounds like we got company. Hold it, hold it. Just a coupla teammates. Take it from me. A guy could get killed out there. A guy could get hurt right here. Well, it ain't the Rainbow Room but I'll take it. Too bad you guys ain't medics. I got an amputation case here. Show 'em your Purple Heart leg, Shorty. Hey, you're in C Company aren't ya? I'm not but my friend over there is working for the Germans, his job is to talk us to death. There are worse ways to die, believe me. Welcome to the club. It may not be fancy but there's not much lead floating around here. You're not plannin' to stay here are ya? The whole German Army's comin' down from Rocca di Paolo there. That's why they laid down this barrage. You got a suggestion perhaps? No, fine, you wanna stay here, good, but I'm takin' off. How is he? Okay? Yeah, he's okay. Ya know every time I look at this guy he's takin' off. I'm beginning to think he's anti-social. Hey, they got three more suckers pinned down out there. Come on, you guys, let's get some fire power up here. We keep those clowns hoppin' the three of them can make a run for it. All right, you guys. Here's some cover, take off. Somebody get me a medic kit quick. Get those men back in position. Come on, knock it off, you've seen a wounded man before. Come on, knock it off, will ya? That hill is lousy with Krauts. Bad lieutenant? I'm hurting. My momma. I'm hurting. Momma. Poor sucker. Yeah. Momma give me some water. Here I've got some. Some water. Please. Here. What's the matter with you? You nuts or something? Don't you know any better than to give water to a man that's got it in the stomach? Okay, okay. What're you tryin' to do, kill 'im? Shut up. My stomach hurts. Well he's still breathin'. All right. Those fireworks were for you, soldier. The Germans must want you pretty bad. Yeah. This must be your lucky day, mister. I'm hurt. Did you lose your outfit too? That's right, Lieutenant. Well, welcome to the parlor. We're all orphans here. I'll take off as soon as I get my breath. You take off and you won't have any breath. I'm not worried, you heard the lieutenant. Today's my lucky day. You stick your nose outta here and your lucky day is finished. One of the radio truck is here and the other is here. They both have the fix of the captain's signal and we located him at this point. Was anybody able to get a visual sighting? And the coordinated report are the same as the radio signal gave us. He's with a group of Americans in a small destroyed village. There. Right now, they're under direct infantry and machine gun fire. Get word to the officer in charge to withdrawal his troops slowly. What the hell is that, a turtle? Oh, not just a turtle, it's very special turtle. Been with me ever since Bizerte. Oh, Lily Marlane, meet Sam. Sam, meet the company mascot. She's not very glamorous. Well, that depends on your tastes. Times like this a man can't be too particular. Besides, she's all woman. She's completely feminine. See, today she's upset. She misses the outfit. If you have to have a mascot why don't you get something useful? Like what? Well, like one of those little Italian farm girls. she could do your washing, cook for ya, tuck ya in at ni-- Yeah, yeah, that's a great idea. I'd write that down and put it in the General's suggestion box. I did. He liked it. Last time I saw the General he had a little Italian farm girl washing and cooking for 'im. See what I mean? You can't be too ... You can't, you can't win. Ten years from now when I'm back home watchin' the ballgame, I'm gonna bust out laughin' thinkin' about all this. What makes you think you'll be out of the Army in ten years? Don't talk like that. Not even in jest. See anything out there? No, but I wish they'd make some noise out there. It's creepy when it's quiet like this. I don't like it. Well, everyone to his taste. I like the quiet myself. I figure more men get hit when there's noise. Yeah, but for all we know a whole regiment's creeping up on us right now. Coming through the town to pin us down here. You're a real optimist there. You got any other little happy thoughts like that? Hey, stop, that's enough. That's an order. You see 'im light that cigarette he's tryin' to get us all killed. All right, he knows what he did but you don't see any dead bodies lying around. Nobody's dead, Sergeant. I need a drink of water. Where's he get off pulling a stunt like that? Did you see the look in his eyes? I seen 'im like that before. He's been up in the line too long, seen too many guys get it, that's all. That's what I say, he's off his rocker. I tell ya if he tries that once more I'll get even. Now listen to me. We're all in this together and as I see it the best way for us to get back to our outfits is for us to stick together. With as little friction as possible. I'm the ranking man here so I'll take over. Our first job is to get that machine gun off our back. Any comments? Whatta ya say? All right? What's your name, soldier? Miller, Harry Miller, sir. All right, Harry, I want you to take the first two men on your left and see what you can do about knocking out that gun. We'll lay down as much protective fire as we can to cover ya. Do you have any grenades? Yes, sir. I don't know how I do it, man. I guess I'm just natural born lucky. You and me both. Come on, let's get going, eh? Whatsa matter, we're holdin' up the war? Hey, hold to Lily Marlane for me, will ya? She's a lady, she doesn't like this kind of action. Tarzan, will you forget your pets? 43 vacant apartments in this town, I have to move in with him. All right, everybody into position. Let's bring 'im over, he'll be safer here. It won't do him any good and it'll just get someone else killed. I'll help you, Lieutenant. Not a sound, that's funny. Can't see any sign of them yet. What's that, the Kansas City bus? I don't know, let's have a look. Hey. They've gone all right. Well you sound disappointed. Maybe we can get 'em back. Whatta ya think? I don't know. It's a cinch we didn't scare them off. Well I wouldn't be too sure of that. Hey look, you check on the left flank and you take a look on the right. Okay. Why doesn't something happen over there? They must be getting close. They've gone, sure enough. Well, there's nothing over there. That's all we can do here then, let's get back. Hey, Ben. If all details get as easy as this it'll turn me into a volunteer. You know I'm kinda sorry the lieutenant didn't ask for volunteers 'cause that's where I shine. Back in my outfit when they ask for volunteers for a dangerous mission you know who the first one up is? You. No, a short redhead named Griggs. Hey, come on, let's get back, huh? Hey, remind me to look you up after the war. You'd make a great straight man. What happened to them? They been gone long enough. If they're not back soon I'll go out after them. What're you guys doin'? Get down! Take it easy, Sarge. We may have BO or something but anyway they're gone with the wind. They're gone? Yes, sir, just as we were gettin' close to the gun they all took off in the truck. Yep, Lily Marlane did it again. What could that mean? Something stinks about this. Something stinks real bad. How is he? He's dead. Yeah. Well it's just as well. We could never have gotten 'im back to our outfits anyway. Ben, why don't we uh ... Yeah, I'll pray, Lieutenant. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Lieutenant, we been messin' around here long enough. Those Krauts have got something up their sleeve. Go ahead, soldier, but make it snappy. We won't make any attempt at a spoken prayer. I'll leave that to each of you to do something if you wish. Leave it alone, will you? I want any help from you I'll ask for it. Relax, I was just tryin' to give you a-- Don't do me any favors. Well, I won't. How do ya like that? Don't you know the independent type when you see it, Harry? Why help a character like that if he doesn't want it? Look, I'm sorry, I didn't know you had the Crown jewels in there. - Look, both of you quit riding me, do you understand? Are you including me in this? I'm not including, I'm meaning you. Get off my back. Make me. Go on, make me. Come on, cut it out now. Your tops on my list, mack. We'll get our exercise later. Now let's get underway here. Everybody ready? They're yours, Sergeant. All right, there isn't much of a road so watch where ya walk but watch everything else, too. Let's go. How ya makin' out? Okay, I guess. That creepy kinda quiet's back again. Don't let it get ya jittery. Remember, the enemy isn't super human. They're only men like you and me. Yeah, but Sam, there's a lot more of them. Hey, how's that Purple Heart leg of yours holdin' up? Shouldn't you be on a crutch. Some of your jokes should be, I know that. Don't get sore, buddy. Here, have a stick a gum. You mean your jaws aren't tired after all they bull you been shooting? You're pretty sharp today. Any sign of the Sergeant yet, T.I.? No, sir. Hey, where'd ya get that? That's a German bayonet isn't it? No, it's Austrian. Chuck gave it to me as a souvenir. Carved my initials in it. Yeah. Here he comes, Lieutenant. We'll run into trouble if we try to cross the river downhill, Lieutenant. The Krauts have got patrols out all along the bank. Well, let's try again further up. Let's go. This is the kinda quiet I like. Times like these you think maybe this war's just a nightmare you're having. Any minute you're gonna wake up. Well I know where I'd like to wake up and it ain't here. Ya know you've simmered down since this morning. What happened to that chip you were carrying when ya landed here? I still got it. I keep it in my pocket and take it out when anyone tries pushing me around. Oh excuse me for asking but there's a lotta pushing around in the Army. How come ya lasted this long? Because I push right back. I'm beginning to think we're the Lost Patrol. 'Member that picture? Yeah. Old Errol Flynn shootin' at those Arabs. That wasn't Errol Flynn. What do you mean? It's always Errol Flynn. Get down here. I think I see 'em. Where? In which window? Second window from the left. I'm gonna get 'im. Give the sniper some targets to keep 'im from spotting 'im. I'll take it first. No cigar for you, Adolf. Come on, hotshot, on your feet. Travers has come after the sniper and we've gotta distract his attention. Lieutenant's orders. So let him come and tell me. Oh, some people never learn. How's Harry? Not good, Lieutenant. He's going to spot the Sergeant, somebody take it. Whatta ya got? Ellis, check through here. Sergeant! Hold it! You just can't wait to kill somebody, can you? Why not? He got Miller back there, didn't he? Good job, Sergeant, but try and get ahold of yourself. You're losing your grip. What do you wanna do, Lieutenant? Nursemaid this Kraut until we get 'em back to our units? This man's a prisoner of war. And he'll get the treatment he's entitled to until we can turn 'im over to the proper people. Oh, I'll bet you got the merit badges, Lieutenant. Miller's dead, Lieutenant. Bullet went right through 'em. That's swell. The lieutenant probably wants to give this Kraut here the sharpshooter's medal when he comes to. All clear, Lieutenant. Good. Sam, Calhoun, take care of a grave for Miller. Ben, T.I., tie the prisoner up. Use his belt. I guess we'll dig in here for the night. It'll be dark by the time they finish with Miller. Stay out of the house, it may be booby-trapped. Sergeant, work out a guard list. Use everybody. You and I 'ill take a turn like the rest. I'd like the first shift, Lieutenant. Hate to have my sleep interrupted. Let Ben take it first. The radio trucks report that the transmitter has been stationed here for an hour now. They'll probably stop for the day. Possibly. The patrols I ordered along the river, where are they now? They are covering from here upstream to this point. Fine, just be sure to keep them moving at the same speed as the captain. What about the patrol on the north? They are at this farm, for the moment. Fine. If the captain should find it difficult to hurt his American friends the way he wants to, these patrols should be used as our persuaders. Is that understood? I sure hope you never find out how close you came to getting your head blown off by Travers or you'd drop dead. Where ya from? Berlin, Hamburg? Beaux? Munich, Dresden? Well, 20 to 1 you're a farmer. I bet ya never talk anymore than this even at home. Ya married? Well whatta ya know? You moved. Well, we've got something in common, anyway. We're both being pushed around by an army. Here, have a piece, it's good for ya. It's very relaxing. If you'll pardon my fingers. Good, huh? Ya know, I oughta have a picture of you to send home to my Uncle Phil. He thinks all you guys have horns. And I bet I could really find out what made you tick. If I'd only learned a little Yiddish from 'im. Yiddish, Jewish it's close-- Whatsa matter? I offend you? Huh? You lousy, ignorant. Boy you came just in time. I was ready to. Oh, oh, oh, oh my goodness. All right, who fell asleep on guard? Mack? What's up? That lousy Kraut killed 'im then took off. He must've fallen asleep. That's what you get for playin' it by the book. Listen, Sergeant. No, you listen. That bar on your shoulder doesn't mean you know all the answers. For my money ya know too damn few. Is this bar bothering you, Sergeant. No, it isn't the bar. I've just had it up to here with you 90 day wonders blundering away the lives of poor suckers like that. Shit, Christ. Hey can't we stop that? Nah, let them get it out of their system. Should we uh ... Yeah, let's cover 'im up. What about this? Said it was his outfit's mascot. He asked you to look after it before, T.I. You wanna do it again? Yes, sir, I'll take care of 'er. Let's make it fast. We gotta get outta here. There's no use kidding ourselves. We could be in real trouble. How do ya figure that? If that prisoner joins up with his outfit we won't be exactly a well-kept secret anymore. The one thing we don't need is a publicity agent. I'd say we're about here, wouldn't you? This must be where we spent last night. And these markings, could be that ridge. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that must be the place where our guys broke through to San Corrado. Now it looks like rough going all the way if we stay on the river. I think our best bet is to go straight to San Corrado. That'd be all right. It doesn't look too bad if we head that way. No, only if we run into trouble at that farmhouse. I think our positions are only two miles away in that direction. Don't ya think we could rush those Krauts down there and get across that river somehow? I'm not rushing anybody if I don't have to, believe you me. I believe you, bud. But maybe if I give ya a little help the way I did the last-- Look, you try that once more and I'll bust your head open. Knock it off, both of you. You want those Krauts all over us? We've come too far to stick our necks out where it isn't necessary. I say we should go straight northeast to San Corrado. Let's hit the road. Hold it. I don't like the looks of those ruins there. Why don't I go up and take a look around? Well, you don't have to, ya know. You've been pulling more than your weight around here. I know. I just wanna get us back to our outfits before anybody else gets killed. All right. Go ahead, Sergeant. We'll cover for 'im from here. How come the sergeant's so anxious to get to San Corrado? Beats me. Are there any Germans around here? Germans? German? There anybody else around here at all? No. No. Any of you guys speak Italian? This joker's been rattling off about a mile a minute but all I can get is that his son has a farm over here. They've been holed up in this bombed out church because the Krauts moved in to the farm a couple of days ago. Are they still there? Well, he doesn't know. But they could all be inside. He sent his grandson over to see what he could find out. If you got all that, Sarge, your Italian's a lot better than mine. How's yours T.I.? Uh, well, I can say I love you, that's about all. What else do ya need? That and... that's all I know. Does anyone here speak Italian? I know a little, Lieutenant. Let me see what I can do. See what I mean? What's that all about? You had the story right, Sergeant. After that farm, another six kilometers and then we're in San Corrado. Ask 'im if that's the Germans playing the radio over there. It's his son's wife. She likes Germans. No. She's a bad and foolish girl but she doesn't like all Germans. Good for her. Apparently she went to Rome last year with some German colonel. Now the family won't take her back and the partisans don't want 'er in San Corrado. The boy's whistling. The old man thinks he means there are no Germans over there but he's not sure. Yeah, I'm not sure either. Sounds to me more like he's whistling for a taxi. In that case, Sam, maybe you better go over and check his story. You and T.I. Yeah, but what if that place is jumpin' with Krauts? Whatta we do then? Well, then you just write your congressman a nasty letter. Use what protection you can and look out for booby traps. We'll cover for you and when you start reaching the house we'll come over. Say, Calhoun, Ben said she didn't like actions like this. Will you put 'er in your pocket? Yeah, sure. Hey, will you put me in your other pocket? I don't like actions like this either. I don't blame you. Well, let's get goin' T.I. Stay over this way. If there's a fracas we don't want that kid in the line of fire. I'll try to draw some fire. If anything starts off and ya can't spot anybody, you take the window, I'll fire at the door. Check. Excuse me. But I don't understand. Why do you spend 20 minutes to come 200 meters? My old father-in-law comes in ten. This is an empty house and I would not hurt you. So, why are so afraid? Ho, you do not believe me it's empty. Come and look then. Oh, you think there are Germans here? Come in and look for yourself. Oh, it is a shame to disappoint you. Well, perhaps you think I have a regiment hiding under my house. Oh, I'm very sorry, I cannot show you any Germans. She's sorry. She's sorry. She's sorry. She says she's sorry she cannot show us any Germans. Nice job, boys. I guess we're just too brave for our own good, isn't that right T.I.? That's for sure. Let's take ourselves a break. You deserve it. Okay. Good afternoon... I'm Lieutenant Willotsky. Tell me, Lieutenant, what I'm missing here? A war or some type of football game? I wish it were just a football game. You speak good English. Thank you. My German is much better. But perhaps that doesn't surprise you. You know you coulda made things a lot easier if you'd bothered to tell your people over there when the Germans left. Why didn't you? Answer your question? I guess so. Has that been going on for long? Six weeks now, since I arrived. They write notes when it is necessary. And bills for my food and rent. It must be kind of lonely. It is. I can't say that I-- That you what? Over there they talk the things about me. Didn't they? They said something about a German officer, yes. They didn't say anything else? How I dislike Americans, for example? And why? No, they didn't, but that's something I'd like to hear about. Lieutenant, did you ask her how many Krauts there were and what direction they were headin' when they left here? No, not as yet. I'm not sure but perhaps there were 14 or 15 German soldiers. They went over the hill. In the direction of San Corrado. I appreciate your telling us. Have we got a portable lie detector? What makes you think she's telling the truth? Excuse me, I must go in now. I guess I kinda hurt 'er feelings. That's too bad. She hurts mine though. All right, men. It's possible there's a German patrol staked out on the other side of that hill. It's too late for us to do much about getting past it today so we'll dig in around back here for the night. Are there any comments? Yeah. Sarge, where's your girlfriend? Go to hell. When did you get the last report on Captain Strobel? Eight minutes ago Herr Orbuster. Then they've been there for quite some time. There has been no word yet when the Pellegrino is to be released. They must be spending the night at the farm. Are the trucks still at the same point? Bring them right in close. And try not to worry. The only direction the Americans can possibly want to take is either south to the river or west to the town. I tell them, Herr Orbuster. Is the river patrol in place by now? And the other patrol's in the valley by now? With the whole approach to San Corrado covered visually. Good. I'm trying to get some sleep now. But I want to be awakened immediately if the captain should be moving again. All right, whose turn is it now? Mine and Calhoun's, I guess. How's everything out there? Pretty quiet? Couldn't be quieter. Hey, what's ol' T.I. doin' over there? He found a beat up guitar under the house. Good boy, T.I. Now all ya have to do is get yourself a horse you'll be one of those movie stars. Yeah, I didn't know you were a musician T.I. He ain't, not from the squeakin' and squawkin' we been hearin'. Well it's all busted, I gotta fix it and tune it up, don't I? Where do you want us, Lieutenant? Oh, I'd like the Sergeant to take over out in the front and you go where Sam was. Out in the rear there. Fine by me. You a family man, Lieutenant? Yeah, yeah I got a couple of kids. Not that they'd recognize me even if they saw me. At least I know Tom wouldn't. He's the youngest. You married? Not yet, but one of these days I'm gonna take the plunge. And seriously too. First thing I'd do is I'm gonna burn that little ol' black book. I got a piece of advice for you. Get married the day you leave the service but not before. I'd give anything to be a bachelor with no strings again. Not that I wanna play the field, nothing like that. Only, when you've got strings, big, thick ones like I've got tying me to my wife and kids and you're separated for months and years, you get really hopeless, ya know. Well, I guess that's what they mean by being nervous in the service or something. Yeah, but I know what ya mean. How's the guitar, T.I.? Ya know, it just occurred to me why he's working so hard at it. He's getting ready to go around and serenade the... under her window. Isn't that the idea, T.I.? Well she certainly is a nice lookin' girl. Well what're you gonna sing 'er, T.I.? Somethin' about the good ol' days in Michigan? Yeah, but Sam, I'm from Ohio. Ohio, then. Well. Good-Bye, Miss Lucy I'm goin' to meet the phono I'll be returnin' just when I cannot tell Please write me nightly kiss me as I go now For it's Ohio fare thee well Fare the well, Ohio, I'mma leavin' If I die beneath the shot and shell Miss Lucy tell me that there'll be Someone who's a grievin' For it's Ohio fare the well For it's Ohio fare the well I'm sorry, no... Was that you singing last night? Yeah, did you see where the others went? I thought we were gonna take off early? They wait for the Sergeant. He has been over the hill to see where the Germans are. The lieutenant has gone off to the shelter. I don't know why. Perhaps to see if you are being followed. The other two men are um... On guard you mean? On guard. Huh, you know you speak it quite well. Say, I would forget all about Lady Marlane. Can she get some exercise down here? Uh-huh, is she yours? No she's the mascot of an outfit and I'm just taking her back to them. Say, I oughta get washed up. Where do you get water around here? Oh, there is a little spring down there. And I've got to wash some things. Hey, binoculars. Can I look through these? Hey, these are really strong. Why things a mile away look like they're right under your nose. Hey, hey, there's a tree down there by the fountain and I can count every leaf on its branches. Well whatta ya-- Hey. What? I thought you said that-- What? He doesn't think anyone can see 'em. Well what's he doing? He's waving. Hi. Whatta ya suppose all that was about? They make things so difficult. These are great glasses. What do you use them for? I don't use them. They belonged to my husband. All right, Lily, let's go. Here, I'll take that. Ya know I wish you coulda met Chuck. He was really a great guy. Ya know one of the reasons I like talking to you is that you seem kinda sad and lonely like you've lost someone real close to you just like me. Or am I being too personal? No. I like hearing you talk. The men call you T.I. Is that a name? Oh, that stands for Timothy Ira. But you, you said you were married. Was it for very long? Less than a year. My husband taught languages in Davonna. Because of sickness in his lungs he wasn't in the army. After we married, we go to live in our apartment. One Sunday morning I took a skirt to my dress maker to be repaired. And big planes come down and without warning they dropped bombs. When I came back, there was no house. And two days longer, they dug out my husband's body. Oh I'm awfully sorry to hear that. Do I have to tell you who drops the bombs? The Americans. Yes, the Americans. Our liberators. Afterwards, I thought I would become ... How does one say it? Insane. Then, a German colonel to whom my husband had been teaching Italian was sent to Rome and asked me to come with him. I went. And when he left, I came back here. I see. I could sell you about an American soldier entering my room last evening. You know, you are very like my husband was. Thanks, that's a compliment. Giovanna! Oh no. He mustn't do that. If his grandfather sees him it will-- I must send him to the house. Sure, go ahead, I'll do your laundry for ya. Hey, look. Why ... These are those gadgets I saw all the way from up the house. Why they're batteries. German-made. You have a beautiful farm here. How many acres? I have to speak to the Sergeant. How'd it go? Did you manage to find anything? The Krauts are there all right. They're dug in-between the hill and San Corrado. Don't ask me what they're doin' there. They're spaced out like a picket fence. That sounds like a reception committee. Do you think we can get through them? Well, there's a place where we might try but I don't like the set-up. I'll admit that star boarder up there is quite a dish but you get better service from the lady of the house. Okay, let's get the other guys. We gotta get moving. Hey. There's one of them there. Hey, there's something strange about it. Hey, it's got blood on it. Fresh blood. Wasn't T.I. the last to have 'er? As far as I know. T.I.! Hey, T.I.! Have you seen T.I. anywhere? Somebody killed him. What about her? She's running out. Do you know how much force it takes to shove in a blade that deep? Neither of the women or the old man could push it in half that far. It's his souvenir bayonet. Well, let's take T.I. up to the house. Look, friend, you could do me a big favor. This bother you? Yes. All right, so I'll stop. Thank you. Sergeant. Hey, Sergeant! I want everybody to hear this. When we report in at San Corrado I'm giving a full account of T.I.'s death. I've made some notes here to help me. The last person to speak to T.I. that we know of was the girl. She last saw 'im in the spot where he was found dead a few minutes later. He was killed with his own bayonet, taken from his pack during the morning. Neither mother, children, nor grandfater near house all morning. And two of our guards in immediate area. So possibility that strangers could've entered and stolen weapon must be ruled out. Neither mother, children, nor grandfather have strength enough for death blow. A conclusion is kind of obvious, isn't it? Yeah, what's that, lieutenant? It's clear to you men, I guess. That one of the four of us here killed T.I. Do you have any idea why someone would want to kill a harmless kid like him? Not at all. I can't buy that, Lieutenant. All right, buy it or don't. But I say one thing. Until we get to San Corrado and report in, we stay together. And if any of you see anybody wandering off, my orders to you are to shoot him. Am I understood? Yeah. Definite. Yeah. All right, let's get out of here. Tell him to keep everyone away from where we put T.I. That there'll be some men out from San Corrado to look at 'im. Yes, sir. Hey, look who wants to come along? Oh, does anyone want her? I don't. Not me, she's a jinx. Not me, you've struck out twice already, Lil. Good-bye... try and choose your friends more carefully next time. Don't worry, you won't be lonely long. Hope the feud cools down. Good-bye, honey. Here's a present for you. Go on. Take good care of it. It'll bring you good luck. You say the Pellegrino is to be released in three hours? Thank you. Contact me radio track number two, please. Sergeant Behr speaking, yes. K20Y3, good then it's moving. The signal's moving toward the town. At last. The patrol I ordered in the valley, are they there now? And alerted for the captain's approach. Contact them now. Tell 'em that though I want visual sighting, they must keep undercover. If they draw American fire, I'll have 'em court-martialed. Well, there it is. San Corrado and home plate. We ain't there yet. See that ridge between here and the town? There's Krauts all along behind it. This morning I spotted one dug in by an old tree and another one by a jagged rock. Don't ask me what they're doin' there. The whole set-ups just screwy enough to make me nervous. You said you saw a place we might get through them? Yeah, might. There's a crick bed, runs through that ridge. Now if we go through one at a time and keep low, we might just make it. But I ain't givin' any guarantees. It's in your lap, Lieutenant. Do we try it? Let's get down there. Krauts are there, all right. I can smell 'em. They're pretty well dug in though. I ain't spotted one this trip. Let's hope they're not cookin' up a surprise party for us. Want me to go first and see what it looks like? Good. We'll keep ya covered from here. When you get to other side, you cover for the next man coming through. That'll be Sam, then Calhoun, and I'll go through last. All right. Don't know why I should feel so relaxed. I might be in worse danger right here and not know it. What's that supposed to mean? You mighta knocked of T.I. and been planning the same thing for me right this minute. How do I know you're not? It would be a good place, wouldn't it? Sam and the Sergeant sure wouldn't want to come back to investigate. Maybe I'm giving you ideas. You could've killed 'im just as easily as anyone else. Take off, Calhoun. Well, that's over. Let's get outta here fast. Hey, soldier. Good morning, sir. We're from Northern Outfit. Where do we report in? The adjunct's office is right over there, sir. I'll show you. That buncha people over there, is that it? No, that's the prison. The adjunct's office is further out the road. What's going on? We announced yesterday we would free political prisoners at 5:00 PM so lots of families, I guess. Thanks a lot. You're very welcome, sir. Franklin! Yes, sir? That's your man, Lieutenant. Get these up to the major on the double, Franklin. Yes, sir. Sir, Lieutenant Willotsky of the 283rd Infantry reporting in with three stragglers from the Rocca di Paolo action. Sir, I've got a peculiar story. Involving the death of at least one man and it may take a little time to explain. Look, Lieutenant, we've got ten men dying every 30 seconds just up the road from here. Your story can wait. Report to my office at 8:00 with your men. Well, whatta we do in the meantime? Well, I'd like to go find a place a and get a beer. A beer? All right, I'll buy the first one. You buy it, I'll drink it. The radio trucks report that Captain Strobel is in San Corrado. Has the weather patrol confirmed visually? The lieutenant said there's no one. Then check the transmitter's coordinates again. And contact the lieutenant. Tell him to move his men as close to the town as possible. And to stay there if Captain Strobel needs help. Oh no, no, no thanks. I've already had four and that's my limit. Ehhhhhh, you can't stop now, the lieutenant's buyin' this round. So, what'll we drink to this time? To the women, God bless 'em. That's all right by me. And me. Check. Hey, buddy. Why do you call this poison Grandpa? Because after ten shots your teeth fall out? It's not Grandpa, Sarge, it grappa. Oh. Well my friend and I can carry on a conversation without any outside help. Can't we friend, huh? I can see that. Yeah... what can ya see, killer? Huh? Take it easy, Sergeant. Lieutenant, we don't wanna stop this game now, do we? You started it this morning when you told us that one of us killed T.I. Ever since then we been lookin' sideways at each other wondering who it is. Now we're throwin' this poison down hoping that one of us is gonna get drunk and let something slip. Well, okay. I figured out who it is. This is the only guy that coulda done a thing like that. 'Cept for you and two other guys. What are you, Sergeant? A judge and 12 jurymen wrapped into one? No, Lieutenant. You're the judge. And you've got a book of rules up here where you should have a head. All right, come on fellas, let's drink it up, shall we? That's what we came here for, isn't it? And let's make this the last one. Well let's drink it to ... That pretty little... right over there. ...to you, to you. Both of you, won't you join us? Too late, Sam, too late. You mean to say you're gonna let something like that get away? One'll get ya ten I'll have 'em back here in five minutes. Any takers? Look, hold the fort, I'll be right back. That other helmet's kinda nice, too ya know. Hey, buddy, let's have the check. Might be worth having a look. Somehow I think this place has lost its appeal. Sam had the right idea. Let's give 'im some support. I'll pay for Sam's. He can pay me back later. ...thank you. Hey, look, Sam didn't make the grade after all. There's Sam over there. What's he waitin' at the prison for? One of his girlfriends doin' time? Hold it. I want to see what he's up to. What do you suppose he's doing? You sure I can't drop you someplace? I'm driving eight miles up the road. I can let you off anywhere you like. You are very kind. But I must see some friends just outside the town. Don't worry about me. I'm afraid I can't help that. But you know best. I will reach the north without any trouble. I know well this country. Good-bye, sir. Good-bye to you, sir. And all good luck. Is Captain Strobel... moving around town? It looks as if he's heading out of town towards our patrol in the valley. And has the patrol spread out as I ordered? They spread out between these points. Good. Then contact the lieutenant. Tell him to advise me when official sighting is made. And tell him to take every precaution and keep his transmitter clear of any communication except to and from this office. Pellegrino. Pellegrino! Take one more step and I fire. Ah, you don't fool me. I know you know what I'm talking about. No. You walk ahead of me in that direction. Make one move out of the ordinary and I'll fire. Let me warn ya, I've already killed once today, there's no reason I should do it twice. You're on your way back to German lines. We better get 'im before he drills that poor sucker. He's gonna get every chance to clear himself. Yeah, famous last words. Hey, Sam! What goes on? All right, come on down. All right. Break it up. Lieutenant. I beg you to return me to your headquarters. But not to this man's cursory. He said he was returning me to the German lines. Ha, where'd he dig that up? That's the second time today he's knocked the wind outta me. What in the hell are you doin' with 'im down here? All right. All right, so I'm a lousy drinker. I didn't leave that wine shop to follow the girls. I was sick as a dog. As I was sitting in an alley feeling sorry for myself, who should come along but Junior here. Tried to knock me out and rolled me for all I had. So I took 'im down here to give him a good goin' over. Teach 'im a lesson. Well told, Sam. Too bad it isn't true. Too bad for you, that is. We haven't taken our eyes off you since this man left the prison. What did he say? That I must walk in this direction. If I make a bad move he will kill me. He said he had killed once today, there was no reason shouldn't happen twice. T.I. Yeah. There's no need for that. Why not? Those are his buddies. They'll give 'im a welcome home party. In his American uniform. Maybe one of you knows what this is? It slipped from his pack during the fight. Like a small-sized radio transmitter. German-made. I've never seen one like this before. Probably locate him while he's wearing it. It must be, that's why he's walking out in the open there. He believes the transmitter is keeping him from being shot at. Hey, Sam. Look in your pack. That lousy Kraut. He forgot to pay me for those drinks.
