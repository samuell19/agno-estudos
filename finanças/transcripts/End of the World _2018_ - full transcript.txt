The Sun. A source of light, warmth, and life itself. It plays a pivotal role in the continued existence of earth and its inhabitants. And despite its billion years of age the full extend of the sun's influence on our planet remains a mystery. Its chaotic nature of it's makeup can harm, as much as it protects. A ball of raging fire and magnetic energy. The sun is constantly in turmoil. Expelling energy in the form of solar flairs, storms, And significant releases known as coronal mass ejections. It is documented that these releases have an impact on the earth. Causing environmental changes system interruptions, and beyond. Scientists theorize that if such an event were to occur, The effects of the solar storm would have much more far reaching, damaging and deadly consequences. -Ha! -Yeah. Northern California, 15:30 PM. - Do you want more to drink? - No, I'm good. Hey so.... you me, James's party? Saturday? Dude. My mom, she checked my phone again. Again? I don't think I can go. She saw all the messages. She's not letting me go. She's so lame! I know, it's not fair. Hey! What did I tell you kids about partying our here? We're not ever partying. I don't wanna hear it. I want you to clean all this up, and get outta here! What are you, a mall cop? Dispatch, it's all good. It's just a bunch of kids. I'm 20. Dispatch? Hello! Get a hustle on, huh? And in the future, don't treat private property like your personal playground. What's your issue? What? Wasn't me. I think... I think it's over. What was that? Dispatch! Dispatch! Reports from the USGS confirm that at 3:05 PM standard time yesterday, An earthquake, of 6.2 magnitude struck the Northern California areas. No one confirmed at the time, unusual volcanic activity has been reported in the area as well. Whether the weather is linked to the earthquake or not is yet to be seen. Scientific authorities maintain that it's only coincidence that a major CNE event was observed on the sun. If the numbers our of the NCEI are correct then that volcanic eruption up north is just the beginning. The NOAA ratings are off the charts We are extremely high H-Alpha emissions, and x-ray radiation coming in at intense numbers. Meredith, you just need to take a second and gather yourself. Which reminds me, I should take the radiation index. Look, you know that I'm in agreement with you. A solar super-storm of this magnitude has never been recorded in the whole of human history. There are things yet that we don't know. - True. But we do know that solar flares cause environmental disturbances. And were not just talking about flares here. We're also talking about Coronal Mass Ejections, CMEs. And if there's a strong enough sequences of CMEs, the resulting magnetic plasma, could cause unprecedented disturbances. OK? Earthquakes. Flooding. volcanic eruptions. Possible more and maybe all at once. OK, a lot of lives are on the line here, and the Mayor needs this data immediately. Look, Meredith. Your a good scientist and your dissertation on CMEs provides strong theories. But you and I both know, that untested research on a page... it's just not enough. These are big allegations. And the government will respond accordingly. If you could just wait for Dr. Rigney to get here from the university and maybe--- We can be on the verge of an apocalyptic event, an ELE, and you want to wait on someone with tenure?! It could start looking like World War 4 out there soon and you know I'm right. - Mom? - Bran, I gotta go. Is, is something bad happening? No, just... some colleagues and I... are concerned about something that's happening, but we're handling it. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. Kirby? - Kirby, what did you do with the toaster? - What's going on? I was gonna make toast, but it looks like Kirby got here first. Kirby. Kirby! - What? - Take off your video game and listen. Mom, I've told you a hundred time. It's not a video game. It's called a flight simulator. OK, whatever. Why did you take apart the toaster? Well, it had a hum. I don't have time for this today. Would you put it back together please? Your father needs toast. - Good morning. Did you get any sleep last night? - No, not really. The solar flares situation isn't going anywhere. This is really serious, too. We need ton really think about the safety of other people and the safety of our own family. I set up a meeting with the Mayor this morning, and I'm hoping, she sounds the alarm. "Do you think she'll listen?" - She has to. I mean, if a precursor flare can cause a volcanic eruption, Just imagine what a major solar event will do. And I'm talking in the next few days. In that case I think we'll need more than the Mayor's help. - I should call Cook. "I was afraid you would say that." Yeah, I know, I know, I know. I'm not excited about it either, but I'm not in the military anymore, I can't pull rank. Even though he and I didn't part on the best of terms, if he can help, we have to explore that option. I guess you're right. And you're right. Thank you. No, of course. It's the least I could do it if it's gonna be as bad as you think. So where do we evacuate to? I say the caves. The caves? The northern caves? From our hike last summer? Yes. Exactly those. The natural cave formations up in the mountain range just north of the city, above the forest. And, if you'll remember from our trip, they also house the abandoned military bunker! Built in World War II, just in case there was a mainland attack. So the safety of the bunker, combined with the elevation of the cave... That would save us from any type of flooding. And they're also embedded in the rock, which has survived centuries on a fault line. It's really the perfect place. Han, if the bunkers are military, Cook could definitely be an asset. Okay, well, I think that we should make it our family evacuation plan that if anything starts to look bad we head straight to the caves. You guys heard her, if that's what we have to do, it's what we do. Yeah, and hopefully other people will listen to me, and we can save some other families, too. What is it? It's just the office, usual mumbo jumbo. You know, if you want me to blow this off, I could do that. No, actually. I think that we should all just go about our normal day. You sure? Yeah. Despite the eruptions up north, the CMEs are probably still building, and it's gonna take them a while until they flare. So... And there's always a chance... I could be wrong. Do you think that it could all just be a mistake and blow over? I hope so baby. I really hope so. You know what, why don't I take you over to the Jinson's today? And you just... Enjoy the afternoon with your friend? OK, I need to get to work, before this family has problems of a different kind. Plus, if I leave now, I can still get my drive-through. Drive-through? Hey, you said for us to go about our day, and I'm still getting my breakfast. Besides, what's the Fisher family motto? - "Never give up"! - That's right. Maybe it'll blow over. Yeah, maybe. That's okay Mom. I believe in you. I have faith in science. Me too Kirby, me too. I just hope my faith is misplaced this time. Look, Sullivan. I can't be taking calls from civilians. I've got a unit to run. I'm not exactly thrilled about this either, Cook. But if you just put aside our personal issues for a moment... This is a matter of utmost importance. Personal issues? There are no personal issues, Fisher. It's a soldiers prerogative to forgive and forget. And I've chosen to do neither. But what's between you and me is ancient history. Meredith make her choice and... I've moved on. Yeah? If that's true, why did you try to make a move on my wife last summer when we saw you? Alright, goodbye Fisher. - No, wait... no no, Cook, Cook! - Give me a reason why I should? You forfeited your rights to my attention, when you left the military for civilian life! 'Cause a lot of lives can be in danger. You've got 2 minutes. So I'm taking Sarah over to the Jensen's, and then I'm headed to City Hall. You can come with me if you'd like. Yeah... sounds like a thrill a minute? But I'm actually headed over to Jared's to play video games for a bit. - And? - And then finish fixing the toaster? Good answer. Alright, stay in the neighborhood just in case. OK? And stay out of trouble. Yeah, you too. Look, Sullivan. We're well aware of the situation upstate. We've consulted with many army scientists, and they assured us that there's no cause for concern. Yeah, I know how they think and cook. But Meredith truly believes this is a clear and present danger. And if she's right, a lot of lives can be on the line! Look, My wife's not some conspiracy nut. She's a vetted scientist, and I believe her. You used to too. That's not fair. Sullivan, and you know it. Look, right now my superiors don't see a cause for concern. My hands are tied on this, and you know they are. Look, look, don't make this personal. I'm not. And I suggest that you do the same. Look, in the meantime, I'll place a call to FIMA and the NSA to see if they can investigate further, But if they don't see, that there's a cause for concern, then my involvement ends there. Thank you Cook for even taking the time. I'm sorry, Sullivan. - Me too. Let's go. Oh, wait... Yes! Mam, please open the bag. Excuse me. May I help you? I'm looking for the mayor's office. I have an appointment with him today. I'm Patricia, the Mayor's assistant. You said you have uh... an appointment? Yes, uh... my name is Meredith fisher. The scientist. Yes, that's me. Yeah, unfortunately the Mayor stepped out, so she's not at her office at the moment. When will she be back? This is a very important--- I don't know what time she'll be back, Mam. I don't think you understand. This is a very urgent matter. We are literally talking about life or death here. Mam, if you're planning on waiting for the Mayor, I'm gonna need you to take a seat over here. I need to know about the order was sent. Yeah sure. One day shipping? One day shipping. - Good morning, Natalie. - Oh Hey, Sullivan, how are you? By the way, Stephenson is going crazy today. Of course he is... Yeah, alright! Thank you very much. Did you feel that? Go go go! Get out! This is what I needed to see the mayor about. It's coming way faster than I anticipated. It's a kernel, doesn't matter, come on! We've gotta move! No, get out! Get out! Go, Go! Natalie, are you okay? Yes. Hold on! What do we do? We survive. Come on, come on. Barry! Barry no, no no no no no. Barry, Barry! Oh god. OK, come on Barry. We need to move. - I can't. Alright look, we gotta try. Ok? We gotta try, the building is unstable, you can't stay here. I can't, I can't. - Come with me. I got you. Come on. Come on. Alright, let's get cleaned up, and let's get mobilized. You heard the man, let's go! Lieutenant! Sir! You're with me. Diaz, were you able to get Fisher on the line? Negative sir. Communications are down. The earthquake must have taken out the towers. Damn it! Let's get all ground transports loaded up, and let's move. Yeah, this is definitely started. What do we do? Oh, well. That's not good. What's that vehicle still doing here? I told you to get all ground transports deployed. No can do sir. Something is wrong with the started. She won't turn over. Of course. As if anything else could go wrong today. You can always deploy the choppers. Not with that brewing, we can't. It's just a little thunder, sir. There wasn't thunder. Oh! OK. Oh! OK buddy. That's right. We're gonna stop this bleeding. I'll just pull the glass out. Try to hold still for me. OK, one more. On three! One, Two, Ahhh! I got it. OK. Hand. Pressure. What was that? Did you learn these first aid skills when you were overseas? Actually, lifeguard training when I was 16. You wouldn't believe how many diving board accidents there are. The military just put my skills to good use. Well, regardless: Thank you. - Tsunami. - What's wrong? Look, Barry. My kid she's... She's at a friend's house. You should go get her. Huh? Your daughter. You're worried. Let Stevenson clean up the mess for once. Go. - I'll be OK. Go! Wait, wait. Is it over? No, it's just beginning. How do we stop it? You came because you have a plan to stop it. You cannot stop weather, you can only hope to get through it. Alright? Look, about inside, I'm sorry about before. Look, that doesn't matter right now. What's important, is that this is happening, OK? And you need to survive. You need to stay as safe as possible. I'm gonna go get my kids. Kirby! Kirby! Sarah? Sullivan? Kirby! Mom! Are you OK? OK. I think we have bigger things to worry about than the toaster. Are you OK? Alright. So what's going on out there? Earthquakes. volcanic eruptions. Flooding. We've never seen a super solar storm of this magnitude before. OK, so... what? what so what does that mean? Like... the world is ending or something? No, it's a solar storm. And like any other storm, it will pass. But it's just gonna do a lot of destruction in the meantime, and a lot of people are in some great danger. My calculations say in about... five hours the storm will break. But that's five hours. We cannot stay exposed, right. We've gotta keep moving if we want a fighting chance. Yeah, OK. So... what about Dad, and Sarah? Well, we can't wait here, the house is way too unsafe, alright? And outside is not much better but we've gotta keep moving alright. Listen, your father, he knows the plan. Alright? And we've just got to hope, that he and Sarah are alright. OK? Now go, get what you need. Quickly! And get to the car. Now, we've gotta go. Where are we going right now? We're going to the Jensen's to see if your sister is still there. Yeah, yeah. Ok. Ok! - Come on, Kirby! I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming. Let's go! Associated Press, Washington DC. The national weather service has issued an emergency bulletin regarding dangerous storm conditions, building in the Golf Of Mexico. A large stretch of the Golf has been battered with downpours of rain and hurricane forced winds. There was no warning of this storm before it began. But now, scientists are reporting that the weather disturbances can be directly attributed to the ongoing super storm, occurring on the Sun. Where is Sarah? Vivian! Vivian. What's wrong? Are you OK? Where is Sarah is she still inside? Is she in the house? Sarah! Sarah! - Dad, I can't. - I can see. I know. Come on Sarah! Come on! Come on Sarah, baby. We need to go now. Where are we going? We're gonna get Mom and Kirby, and we're gonna get to the caves. Are we gonna be OK? I hope so, honey. I hope so. Run. Run! Come on baby! Move! Move! Come on. Just get to the car, baby. Come on. Just get to the car. Dad! OK. I know your scared, OK? But right now, we have to get up, and we have to go. But wha--- Sarah, do you want to live? Yes. OK, then we need to go. OK. OK. Get up, get up--- OK. Get up! It looks like we'll have to go on, on foot. - I don't think I can. Hey, look! I don't think we have a choice, OK? What's one thing Fisher's never do? We never give up. Right. We never give up. We never give up. Wh--- what are we suppose to do if something like that happens again? This is your Dad you're talking about. Alright, remember the camping trip we forgot the lighter for the fire? And how I still made the fire work with the sticks, even though you doubted it would happen. This is just like that. Look, hey! We just need to be resourceful, and clever, and we'll make it! Do you promise? I promise. Come here, come here. What are you doing? I'm leaving a message. For who? Your Mom. I need her to know that we're OK. The International Solar Observatory is now monitoring heavier solar activity, Which can lead to a new CME eruption on the surface of the Sun. Scientists confirm that the flare will likely affect the earth in a matter of hours. Leading to more, if not increased environmental and atmospheric disturbances. How long to you think until it starts? I'm gonna guess, an hour. Maybe less. The frequency between the thunder and the ground-quakes means that the Coronal Mass Ejections on the Sun? They're intensifying. So... so what does that mean? Flooding? - More earthquakes? - Yeah. Which is exactly why we need to get to the safety of the caves, as soon as possible. Do you think we'll even make it? Kirby... look, I know that this is a lot to take in right now. But we are together. OK? And as long as I'm here, I'm not gonna let anything to happen to you. Do you understand me? Even if I have to fight mother nature herself. I'll punch her in the face. Thanks, Mom. Lieutenant, I must have a progress report. Where are we on containment and evacuation? We're barely making a dent, Sir. The waves of the tsunami are down But the water keeps surging in. It's like high tide, but it won't stop. And what kind of damage is that causing? Um, it's hard to say, Sir. The water is channeling into urban areas, so, Alright. It's bad. OK, just clean the areas up as best as you can. The radio is still on the blink, so we have to go with emergency protocol. Assign a soldier from each unit to serve as a messenger go-between and initiate Evacuation plans. Make sure that the civilians are out Of the metropolitan areas. Sir, yes sir. We've also initiated the base's backup protocol, to multiple lines and according to the unit's backup protocols. So we can monitor any activity on live wires. Very good. - Sir? - Yes, Diaz? Is it true there are volcanoes... Erupting around the city? One thing at a time, Diaz. One thing at a time. Let's go. Are we clear of the danger. Well, whether we are of we aren't, we keep pushing ahead. We don't have any other choice. - Why is this happening? - I don't know, sweetheart. Science is your Mom's and Kirby's department. Near as I could tell, it has something to do with storms on our Sun disrupting our atmosphere, or something like that. It's making the weather go crazy. Is it... permanent? Nah, nah sweetie. The storms will subside. We just gotta get through it. Shouldn't we have waited for Mom and Kirby? No. No kid. It wouldn't have been smart to stay put. The only way to keep in front of this thing, is to keep moving through the woods. OK? We'll reconnect with them on the outskirts, on the other side of the city. OK? So just be on that. OK? Dad? Hold on Sarah. I'm trying to figure out which way we're going to--- Dad! What? Run! This way, this way, this way, this way. Come on! How did you know we'd be safe up here. Truthfully, I didn't. It looks like the water is channeling right past on. So you can thank the land for that. So are you saying we... we made it because of luck? Well, Luck certainly had something to do with it. And so is the first thing in the military they taught us about the field. Know your terrain. I'm sorry Dad. Sorry? This morning, even in the face of potential danger, you and Mom... had it together. You made a plan. Even Kirby with all of his sciency stuff was able to be a part of the conversation, and... I froze up, and was scared. I know you both covered to make me feel better. I can learn a lot about bravery from all of you. Sarah... So where to now? Well, we were supposed to go that way, but it looks like were gonna have to get creative. That's the Jensin's. It's so quiet here. Wait... is that, is that Dad's car? Wait. Wait, Kirby? Kirby. Dad, Sarah. Where are they? What is it? Alright, it's your Father. God, I love that man. Mom... Please tell me you heard that. Yeah, yeah I did. Unbelievable. Volcanoes in Los Angeles. Your father is already headed to the caves. Ans I trust that he's gonna do everything he can to keep Sarah safe. Now, we need to do everything we can to do the same. What do you mean? Sarah is in good hands with your Dad, and your with me, and there's gonna be a lot of people out there who aren't gonna be so lucky. We need to help as many of them evacuate as possible. But we can't do it alone. Come on. Do you think there's a way around it up a hide somewhere? Uhh, there's no telling. I mean it's possible. But there's no telling how long it'd take to get there. Like every man: we're outside, we're exposed to danger. We just can't risk it. We can't swim over it. Hey, you're right. We gotta get across, but we aint swimming. So how? I got an idea, but I don't think you're gonna like it. Great. So... where are we going? Well, like I said earlier, your father is gonna do everything he can to keep your sister safe. He's a soldier, he's equipped to do that, we're not. Right, OK, so we need soldiers of our own. We can make it to the military base, connect with your father's old unit. They can not only help us evacuate, but help other people too. We just need to be able to tell them where to go, and we need to do it fast. Cause the worst of the storm has just started. Stop, please! Wait, Mom. Stop the car. Oh, thank god. We need help. Yeah, OK. I'm not sure about this. We just gotta climb sweetheart. OK? We get to the other side, we're clear of the flood waters. I don't think I can. I'm scared. I'm scared too. But if we want to see Mom and Kirby again, we gotta face that fear. OK? Look, I'm gonna be right behind you, the whole time, I'm not gonna let you fall. Do you promise? I promise. Alright, let's do this. OK. My girl! Grab that. My sister, her husband and me, we were trying to get out of the neighborhood somewhere safe. We almost got crushed to this, and now she's trapped! I've been trying to get her out, but it's too much It's too heavy. No no, you don't need to explain. Mom? I see it. Hi, we're gonna help you out of here, OK? How bad is it? Well, it's hard to tell, OK? We're just gonna have to get some of the stuff off of you first. Oh, gosh! This, it's really heavy. Wait, I got tools in the car. Ok, good idea, good idea. One two three! Maybe... get some of this off. It's OK Sarah. I'm right behind you. Daddy! OK. Don't look down. Don't look down, look straight ahead. Go on baby I'm here. OK? Are you doing OK? - What do you have? - Nothing is gonna work. We, we need leverage! Yeah, yeah. Alright. OK Alright. Uhhh. Everybody is gonna... On three 1, 2, 3! Kirby, Kirby, help me get this real quick. That bad, huh? OK, OK put your hand, put some pressure there. Come here for a second. I'm afraid if we move her now she's gonna bleed out in a matter of minutes. She's lost so much blood. I don't even know how she's conscious right now. What am I gonna do? I don't know. We gotta get her outta here! I know I know I know. Mom! It's okay, Sarah. I'm right behind you. OK, OK, I'm here. OK. We gotta get her out of there! We got, we're gonna get you out! We're gonna get someone, we're gonna get you help! Kirby, I'm gonna get something, I'm gonna get this off. OK, ready? 1, 2 Walter, you sweet sweet man. We both know I'm not walking outta here. No!! No Marsha! No! We gotta go! Now don't you die because of me. I'm not gonna leave you! I'll be here for you! You always were. Mom! Marsha! We gotta go. No! No! Go, let's go. I caught you baby. OK, OK, OK. Just a few more feet, OK? Yeah. No! Walter, I'm so sorry. Thanks for trying to help. I don't, I do--- You don't have to say anything. I think that you and Vera should come with us. You guys go without me. I don't want to leave her here. Not in this place. Walter Gibbs, that's nonsense and you know it. My sister didn't die so you could die. Marsha wanted you to live. You wanna do something for her? You do this. I can't argue with that. OK, where are we headed? There's a military base, just a few miles from where my husbands old unit is there. I think they can help us evacuate to this military bunker, up in the northern cage, just outside the city. I think we'll be safe there. Are you sure she's caves can protect us? My Mom was the only one that knew this was gonna happen. OK? She tried to warn everyone but no one listened. She's trying to protect us. Kirby, it's OK. No, no no no. The boy is right. At least you're offering up a solution. It's better than the alternative. Lead the way! Let's get in the car. Did you do a lot of this survival stuff in the military? Yeah. They've prepared us for a lot, but this is a pretty unique circumstance. What? What? Look, phone lines. I have an idea, let's go. Come on. Hold on. I'm gonna take a sneak peak, see if the ground is stable. OK. Dad? How does is look? Is it safe? Let's go this way. Are, are you sure? That road seems faster. Baby, don't look. If you could have any meal right now, what would it be? Are you thinking about food? I guess surviving the end of the world, rooks up a bit of an appetite. What would you pick? Me? A burrito I guess. A burrito? Why a burrito? So I could keep walking, while I eat. And I really like Guacamole. How about you? Cake. Cake? Cake is not a meal! I almost died of smoke inhalation, got blown up, and drowned in a flood. I want cake. Cake it is. Got wisdom for your age, kiddo. So you're a scientist? Yeah. And your husband is in the military? He was, he's retired now. Army man, huh? Brain, very strong. That's sexy. I've always been fond of the military type. My grandmother served as a switchboard operator in World War 2. When I was growing up, she would take me to historical society gatherings where her cronies would... Play cards or reminisce. Yeah? Yeah. She told me a lot of sad stories, but also a lot of comradery. It was inspiring. She told me all about the old switchboards... I was fascinated. Soaked it up like a sponge. I bet she really appreciated all your interest. Sorry, sorry. Yeah, it doesn't seem to be broken. How can you tell? Well, if I remember my biology texts correctly, there would be a lot more information. Let me fashion... A splint out of some of my tools. You got a good boy there. Yeah, we're pretty proud of him. When he's not taking apart our television, or setting the wallpaper on fire with a Bunsen burner. Well, the nice thing about recent circumstances, is... who's gonna know otherwise? Is he your only one? No. No, I have a daughter too. We were supposed to meet when everything started. How? How are you so calm? What do you mean? We have no means of communication, we have no idea when the next explosion is coming. Or if the ground is gonna eat us up. Make no mistake... I'm terrified. What can I do? The only certainty I have to hold on to is hope, and that's what I'm gonna do. For him and for me. What going on now? Hold on. Hold on! Oh my gosh, the sky looks really bad. It's hard to believe that the Sun is causing all this, huh? Yeah. What? Dad? Run, run! Mom, what's going on? Earth's magnetic field is resisting The solar radiation from the coronal ejection. Basically, the atmosphere is going haywire right now. What does that mean for us? It means brace yourself! We'll be at the base in 5 minutes. We need shelter from the lightning. Come on. Dad! Let's go, go! go go. This damn day. Almost there, almost there. Are you OK? Are we stuck? For now. Do you think Mom and Kirby are okay? I sure hope so kiddo. I really, truly do. Yeah, me too. Look, your Mom is tough, alright? Look! She's not a quitter. She's not gonna give up. Alright? We have to imagine wherever she's at right now, she's charging ahead. It's just who she is. I might be the soldier in the family, but that woman, she's a warrior. So if Mom is not gonna give up, we can't either. Ok? OK? OK. Alright. Mom, watch out! Sir, what is that? Hang on! Get down there. Now, go! Oh, come on! Come on come on come on. OK, alright. OK, we're gonna have to make a break for it. OK? Everybody ready? See where we're going? On three. 1, 2, 3! Meredith? Mom! Kirby! Walter! No, no! The Parker solar probe is now reporting the largest solar flare and CME ever recorded. This event is predicted to cause damage to communications, the electric grid and cause violent, climatic and geophysical destruction. Group attention! At ease, gentlemen. I must confess: It's an unexpected but welcome surprise to see you Meredith. Did you connect to Sullivan earlier? So did you talk to him? I did. We spoke just before communications went down. Did he tell you that he was coming here? No, no. Hopefully, he and Sarah are in someplace safe. It was my decision to come here. Why did you want to come here? Storms. I know what's causing them and why there is nothing we could do about what's going on out there. I think a know a place where we can go, where we can potentially make it through. Right, there wasn't any way anyone could have predicted the severity of these storms. They are far more devastating then I could have ever imagined. It's pretty severe, and as far as we can tell, this entire thing has gone--- Global. Yes. Yeah, this is gonna be the largest solar super-storm ever recorded. But, the size of the storm doesn't matter, essentially it's just a storm, and storms... pass. Alright? All we have to do is make it to the other side. And I think I have the perfect shelter for us. We need to migrate as many people as possible The the abandoned military bunkers in the northern caves. And with any luck, Sullivan and Sarah are already there. So what is this place? Good question. What I'll be... Maybe our luck is starting to turn around. What is it? How is your head? Oozy, a little distorted. Are you OK? I don't mean to interrupt. What's going on? We're looking at some maps trying to find a potential route up north. We could use some insight. Absolutely. What do you got? Private? So the idea is for us to find a route lease likely to be infringed upon by the natural disasters. Cause you know, given the circumstances, least likely is still pretty damn deadly. OK, ummm. Well, the topography through here still lines itself to flooding, water or lava like. So... I think you're gonna have to cut this way. Are you certain? Well, as certain as I can be in this situation, which isn't very. Honestly, the bunker idea, I was inspired. Quite frankly, I'm a little bit ashamed that I didn't think about that myself. But can we be certain that the caves will give us the protection that we need? Well, the caves have survived a millennium of earth's inclement whether. And they're naturally forged out of stone. And they're at a high enough elevation that they're unaffected by the flooding, And once you're inside you're protected from the lightning. And that combined with the security of the bunker, Honestly, I really think it's the only chance we've got. It's just uh... Getting there, that's the problem. We have to hurry. Hurry! Alright, let's go. let's go, get a move on it. Clear everything out. So this is the place you were looking for? - What are you doing? - Looking for an unbroken line. If this is a phone company, why don't we just call someone? Most of the standard telephone lines, are getting solar interference. But if I can find an unbroken line, I might be able to send a telegraph. Telegraph? Yeah, long ago, before the days of cellphones and apps, people use to use something called telegraphs, to communicate over great distances. I know what that is, Dad. It's the thing with the wires and codes. That's right, Morse code. Dots and dashes that stand for different letters. That's right. It seems complicated, though. Actually it's... OK, it is. But telegraphs don't require the use of PSTN signal. This is what the solar flares are interrupting. And... there's an emergency backup protocol, That some military units use, when the communications go out. We have the generators hooked up, as live wires. In the event that someone happens to try to communicate the old-fashioned way. I'm gonna try to send a message and hope that someone thought or remembered to do that. And then hopefully, they come and get us. Do you think this will work? We have no other choice, you heard it out there. No way are we gonna get to the caves through that on our own. This is our chance to call for help. I have to take it. Do you think someone is listening? There's only one way to find out. Look, the storm is intensifying. We are on borrowed time. Do you really think these caves will protect us? My Mom thinks they will, and I believe in her. Sir, you better take a look at this. We have clicks on the comms. Sergeant, there's no time. Clear your station, we gotta go now. Sir, it's a pattern. Pattern? Sounds like Morse code. Here, move. It's Fisher. What? But the message is coming in too wild and fast. Can anyone--- Allow me, commander. Switchboards, remember? Listen, listen. He sure has been alright. He's at an old phone office, near the woods on the city's outskirts OK, great! Well we know where he is and now we can go save him. Right? OK. Mother, run! Is it working? I don't know, Sarah! I don't know. Dad! Dad? Dad. Daddy, get up. Get up, Dad. Dad, come on. Get up! Come on, Daddy. Daddy you're find. Come on, get up, OK. Come on Dad, you're fine. Come on Dad! Come on, wake up. Come on Dad, you're fine. Oh my god, 1, 2, 3, 4... The building is going down. We gotta get out of here, let's go! Lieutenant, take point! Move out! Come on, come on! Hey, are you in? Mom. OK. Mom, get in! I need you to stay safe. Mom, get in please. You're gonna go to the cave and you're gonna stay safe. Get in! I have to find your Father and Sarah and we'll meet up there. No! Get in! No, stay. Go, now. I love you! Get up. Come on, Dad. I can't do this! OK. One, two, three, four, five... Come on, Dad! Come on you're fine. 1, 2! Dad! Dad. Dad dad, dad come on come on! Oh my gosh, OK, come on. Oh...! Oh. It's OK baby, it's OK. - I thought you were ... - I'm here, Sarah. I'm still here. Hey, what are you doing? You have to go with us, you have to evacuate. OK? Sullivan is out there and... I know he's alive so I've got to go get him. Look I understand, I do, but the entire world is literally falling down around us. What can one person do against all of this? I gotta try, right? I'm sorry, I gotta get my men to safety. Come with us, please. No, no. You know I can't do that. Look, you know what I feel about you Meredith, how I've always felt about you. Look, we don't have very much time. Let me finish. You're a remarkable woman Meredith. And I'm sorry, it's hard for a soldier to admit when he's lost the battle. Sullivan is a great officer, and he's a good man. And he's lucky to have you. You guys are lucky to have each other. I'm just sorry that I let my own jealousy get in the way of our friendship. For all of us. Cook... Listen, there's a truck on the back lot. They say it's out of commission, but you're more than welcome to give it a try. I just wish you were coming with us. I can't. OK? Good luck. Good luck. Did it work? Work? The telegraph. Oh. I don't know, baby. It's really bad out there. We have to assume no one heard us. We're alone? No. No, no no no no no no no no no no no. We have each other. Let's go! Move, move move move move! Get out there, let's go! Move move move move, We gotta go! It's alright, kid. Your parents will be fine. Where's the kid? Come on come on come on. OK. No! Come on come on come on come on come on come on. Need a hand? What are you doing? What are you doing here? I told you to go. Mom, no! We're gonna get through this thing together. Alright? We started this, we're gonna finish it. Kirby! I'm sorry, but the truck... it won't turn over. Mom, that's exactly why I stayed. Do you know how to fix trucks? I don't know a first thing about trucks, so... Oh, wow! Oh, my. This is great, Kirby! Mom. But I know a lot about those! Mom, come on! No, Kirby no. Get out, let's go. Come on, Mom! Yes. No. Kirby! This is not one of your video games! I told you, it's not a video game! Just get in, and trust me. Please! Put these on, and don't touch anything. Sarah, get up. Sarah, get up! Now! Dad! It's OK, keep going, kid. It's time to get outta here. Yeah. I really hope you know what you're doing. Yeah. Can you hear me? Yeah. I can hear you. Alright, let's go! Yeah, now would be a really good time, Kirby. I know, I need to get it up to 1500 RPM before we can take off. OK, Kirby. Alright, figure it out. Figure it out, Kirby! I know! Kirby. I know. Kirby!! I can't, I can't run anymore. Come on baby, just a little bit farther. No, no. I can't, I can't. Look, just a little bit further, OK. Come on, when we get to the edge of the city, we clear these falling buildings! Alright? Now look. I know it's a long shot, I know it. But the trees! The trees leading up to the cave. That's our only chance of coverage, OK? OK. Come on! It hearts, I breathed in too much smoke. I need you to go just a little bit longer, OK? Just a little further! We just gotta get through this--- Lava. Come on, baby. A little bit further. Where are we going? What are you doing? I'm buying time, I hope. Come on baby. Come on, try to run. Let's run! Come on. Can you keep it steadier? Well, I'm trying. The air is too thin! It's too hot! I can't get any traction. And keep in mind, this is the first time I've ever done this. That was shear luck! Huh, don't tell me that. Don't you tell me that again. Alright, alright, alright. Is that the phone company? where? Here, I'll bring it around. Bring it around, bring it around. Can you see it? Mom, I'm sorry. Mom, we need to go! I'm sorry. So what are we doing up here, I don't know kid, I don't know I'm just--- I'm just trying to buy us a little more time. Time until what? I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry. I'm sorry, baby. Close your eyes. I'm scared. I'm scared too. Just close your eyes, baby. Close your eyes and everything will be OK. Sullivan! Sullivan! Mom! Meredith! Sullivan! Do it. Turn around and go down. Well, I can't get down there... The Lava! Well, what are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get them? What are we gonna do? I don't know! Alright, I've got an idea. Mom, what are you doing? Mom, what are you doing? What are you doing?! Keep it steady! Mom, don't! It's gonna be OK. Mom, no no no no no no. Mom! Meredith! Baby, come here! We're gonna help you jump. OK? Just like before, don't look down. Don't look down, are you ready? Keep it steady, Kirby. I'm trying! Grab it, baby. I can't reach! Grab it. Sarah, hey. Jump! Go! Mom! We're too high, we're too high. Go down. If we get any lower, we crash and we all die. Mom, no no no no no. Mom! Mom mom mom! Keep it steady. Meredith, no! Keep it steady, Kirby! Meredith, you have to go back. You can't make it, you know you can't! Reach, reach up, reach! Mom! OK, come here, OK, hold it there, hold it there, hold it there. Let me get up, let me get up, let me get up! I've never been so grateful for lightning. Come on, Sarah. Climb! I need you to be brave right now. Use everything you've got. Climb! Climb baby! I've got it, Mom! Remember, we're fishers. Yeah! I'm on! Keep it steady, Kirby! Go, keep moving! I'm coming up! Come on get up! Come on! You're the best Sarah! Where's Dad? Come on! Oh god! No. Help me. Come on! Help me. We said "till death do us part". Does that make it today? Deal! Yeah! Wait, Kirby is flying the helicopter? I'll explain it later. Hold On! Hold on Dad, come on! Right, right. Go right! No no no, go left! Go left, go left! No! Kirby, look out! Everyone hold on! Ahhhh! How did you do that? Velocity of the building, Vs. velocity of the helicopter. Faith in science. Is everyone okay? NASA scientists at the solar dynamics observatory confirm that the solar storm is waning. Showing signs, that it will subside. Atmospheric conditions are expected to return to normal, and authorities confirm that the electrical and communications infrastructure, should be restored within a matter of months. Sarah. So is it over? For now, yeah. So, what do we do now? Start over, I guess.
