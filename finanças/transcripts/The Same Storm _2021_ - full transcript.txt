- [Peter] Can you hear me, Noma? I apologize for interruptions. - Yes, I can. No, no, no, not at all. - No. - Not at all. 'Cause I realized - Now- - my camera was on the wrong way. - Yes. - So that was the wrong way, I just realized 'cause the cameras are like... So if we're doing this, right now- - Are you using your phone? Is that what you're using? What are you using? - iPad. - iPad, okay, okay. - Yeah. - Got it, alrighty. - So- I'm gonna try and point where he is. So if that's my eye... - [Peter] So Sandra, this is everybody! - Hi, everybody. (Sandra speaks indistinctly) - Hi! - Yes, hello. - We realize this is an intimate ask, but we're gettin' pretty good at this from our end. - Hello. - Hi, Elaine! Hey, Mary-Louise! - Hey! - What' up? - [Peter] Hi, Ato. - What's up? - Hi, Peter. - [Peter] So we've been emailing each other, but this is our first meeting. - It's nice to be visited. (interposing voices) (group laughing) - [Peter] Yeah, right? Sure, that's true. It's been a lonely few months for all of us. And dude, you are rockin'! And you're rockin' some nice COVID facial hair, too. - Oh, boy! - This is- - The hair is months of, as you can tell, insane overgrowth. - [Peter] Wow! First of all, just... Just a real moment of gratitude at your willingness to let us into your home. It's just a really remarkable thing that you, and the rest of the cast, are so generous in this process. - Oh, my god, my cats are in the ficus. - Old school. - Get outta there! - So you can't really move the camera, only... You can't change the shot. We have to do that, right? - [Peter] Yeah, that's right. You are the camera operator. - Yeah, I could switch, I could turn, I could, like, lay down, I could do somethin, and just be talkin', and like, ohh, uhh- - If I get down, it's a little... But I'm, like, in the refrigerator. - Yeah. (group member laughs) - [Sandra] So in the morning, the light is gonna hit here. - [Peter] Great. Awesome. That's so helpful. - So... But I thought that the sheet looked kinda janky, like somebody just had to put up a sheet. - It's easier with a crew. - I think- Yes. - Yes, but you're handy. - Agreed. - Agreed. - It sure is. - Yeah. - Can you lay the mat out on the carpet? - [Imani] Yeah, for sure. Let put this down. - [Peter] Okay, good. Oh, wow, you're such a trooper. (laughs) Oh, my god! - [Cameraman] Okay, we're rolling. - [Peter] And here we go. - [Crew Member] Scene one, bravo. Take one. Hold for a hand clap, please. (claps hands) - [Peter] And action! (dramatic orchestral music) - Okay, everybody, in your own time. ("Om Namah Shivaya" by Krishna Das plays) (siren wails in the distance) ("Om Namah Shivaya" continues playing) (foot tapping) ("Om Namah Shivaya" continues playing) Beautiful. Great legs. (foot stamping) Okay, we start over. So we turn ourselves upside down to shift our perspective from habit to moment. The moment we try to control the unknown, we lose our balance. (Dionne breathing shakily) (Dionne pants heavily) (feet clomping) And together, we bow, and say, "Namaste". - Namaste. - Namaste! - Namaste. - [Participant] Namaste. - Namaste. - [Imani] Beautiful, class. - Thank you so much! - Great job, everyone! - [Imani] Thank you. - So good to see everyone. - Thank you very much. - Thank you for showing up. (interposing voices) We'll talk to soon, okay? - Thank you. - Thanks again. - Bye! - I'll see you guys next time. (interposing voices) - Bye. - Thank you so much. - Dionne. How are you? - Well, I was a bit wobbly today. I couldn't find my center. - Any news about... - I get to FaceTime with him. - Oh! - (groans) How do I look? - Fantastic! It'll cheer him up to see you. - How are you? - I'm good, considering. - Yeah? - I miss hearing people breathe, feeling energies. Anyway, it's been a bit glitchy with this live streaming, but it's the best we can do. And we've been able to keep and pay all of our teachers, (phone ringing) so there's that. - Okay, that's him. This is him! - You got this! - This is it. Thank you. (phone continues ringing) Hello? - [Joey] Are you Mrs. Davis? - Dionne, yes, hi. Who's this? - I'm Nurse Joey, one of those attending your husband. - Oh, hi, yes. - I understand you were hoping to FaceTime with him. - Yes. They said I could. - We're gonna need need to postpone. - No, no, no, no, no, they promised. - Well, we have a situation, ma'am. - Wait. Well, what happened? - Dr. Judager will be calling you in the next 30 minutes or so. - Well, he was doing better. You turned him on his stomach. - Yes, we proned him. - And that was helping him get better. - [Joey] His oxygen level's increasing, yes. - Uh-huh, but now? - [Joey] He's not as well. - What does that mean? - He's no longer stable. - I don't understand what that means. - He's in critical condition, ma'am. - Oh, god! Is he in a lot of pain? - We have the whole team working on him. - Please tell me you are not putting him on a ventilator? - [Joey] Dr. Judager will be calling you in 30 minutes. - You're putting him on a ventilator! - [Joey] Everyone is is fully engaged. - 70% Of those put on ventilators don't make it! - Your husband has the best team. The doctor will be calling you, I promise. - Wait! Wait, wait! - [Joey] Everyone is doing everything, ma'am. - I'm coming to the hospital. - No, no, no! No! I know this is hard, but we strongly advise you not to do that. - I am coming to the hospital. - I'm sorry, we can't let you see him. - What am I supposed to do? - Stay by the phone. The doctor will call you. - Don't hang up, please, please, please! I am begging you, please do not hang up! - Okay. - (exhales) Just gotta think this through. (sighs nervously) - [Joey] What would you say to him? - [Dionne] Huh? - Just in case. - Think, Dionne. Think, think, think, think! - I have pen and paper. What would you say? - Tell him, Pillow loves her Blanket. Pillow needs her Blanket. Pillow is nothing without her Blanket. (pager beeping) - I'm being paged. What else? - Can you sing? - A little, maybe. - Do you know "Michael, Row the Boat Ashore"? - I know some of the words. I can hum the rest. - [Dionne] He loves it. It's his favorite. - Okay, then, yes. (pager beeping) I need to go suit up. - [Dionne] I... I love him so much. - Stay by the phone. - Okay. Okay.

I'm numb now. - You're a good man. - I'm not a saint. - I didn't say that. - I'm far from it. - You wanna know what I fuckin' think? I mean, you probably don't, but (stammers) you're a goddamn hero is what you are. - It's just my job. - Hey, Joey, you know how at seven o'clock they bang on pots and pans, and cheer, and clap, and everything? Well, tonight at seven, I'm gonna stop whatever wild, kinky ass shit I'm in the middle of doin', and I'm gonna throw open my window, I'm gonna shout, Thank you, Nurse Joey, for keepin' us safe. Thank you. You got tears on your face. - No, I don't. - Okay, so you don't. I wanna wipe 'em anyway. Can I do that? Imagine this is me. - [Voice On TV] My brother catches the virus, that is stressful. (computer beeping) My mother's worried about my brother, and she's concerned. We have a birthday party yesterday for Stephanie, we're standing around the cake. Everybody's six feet from- (computer chiming) - Mom? - Bizarre. - Hello? - Your mic is off. Go to the lower corner- - What? - Go (stammers)... - Celebration of a birthday. - Look at me, look at me. Go to the lower corner, - My daughter's cousin - where it says, "Mute", - has a tragedy. - unmute the "Mute". - [Ruth] I'm pushing every button on the bottom. - Maybe turn off the TV? - Very painful. - TV, turn it off. - Wait a minute. I'm gonna turn off the TV. - They do these cyber- - Oh, fuck! - Oh, my god! - [Voice On TV] So emotionally taxing. (phone trilling) - If- - Okay. It's off now. (phone trilling) (phone ringing) Hello? - Hi, it's me! - What? - It's me! - Is this a robo call? - No, no, it's me! - Hello? - It's me, look! Hi! It's me. - Oh, it can't be. - It is. It's your favorite daughter. - It's you. My only. So what do you want? You want money? You callin' for money? - No, Mom. No. - No, Ma. Don't try and trick me into opening my checkbook, because no one- - No! - What? - I just wanna know how you are. That's it. How are you? - Oh- - I'm just calling to ask how you are. How are you doing? - Oh, I- You mean, we're gonna talk now, like we talk every day? - Yeah, it's been a while. - Is that it? It's been centuries. - It's been a while. - Yeah. See, here's the thing, here's the thing. - [Roxy] What? - The thought has entered my mind, is Roxanne lying? That's your legacy. I mean, everybody has a legacy (speaks indistinctly). Yeah, I'm sorry I think that, but I do think that. - Well, I was hoping you still didn't hate me. - Hate you? No, hate is love twisted. You have taken my love and bented it every which way. And so the only question is, do I stay on this call or do I hang up and go to bed? - No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please stay. Please stay. Please? - Don't go to the beach. You read the news? - What? - You see what's happening on the beach in Florida, those idiot kids? And and the governor here has said, "Stay home". So stay home, because... He's a wonderful man, Cuomo. And then he's... I can't believe he's single. - I know, I know. - Ugh, what a world is it! - What a world, what a world. - Yeah, I know. - Yeah. So Mom? - What? (Ruth scoffs) - I don't know. Other than the beaches, is there anything I can do for ya or undo? (chuckles lightly) - I don't know. I don't know. - I called. I called, Mama, just so you could see how good I'm doing, so you could see the calm, and the clear in my eyes. Look at me. Look. - [Ruth] Yeah, I see. Your eyes don't look so good. - I'm on the up, Mama. I really am. I'm doing really good. - Yeah. Got a job? - [Roxy] I do. - Is it essential? - I like to think so. - So what do you do? - I'm like a counselor. - You're a counselor? Wow! - Yeah. - Yeah. - [Roxy] Well, there's a lot of lonely people out there right now, Ma, so. - (laughs) You're telling that to me? You're telling that to me? - How are you? - If I'm talking to you, I'm not dead. That's how I am. I can't see you. - [Roxy] I'm here. I'm here! No, I'm here! - This goddamn thing! (Roxy speaks indistinctly) I told your brother, do not get me a computer! - I'm right here! - I don't want a computer! I want a phone, and I want a TV set with four channels! - [Roxy] Mom? - You don't get to break my heart again. - [Roxy] Mom, please don't! Please? - In all of my years, nobody has ever broken me the way you have. You broke me. - [Roxy] I'm not breaking anything! - Oh, okay, okay, there you are. There you are. I see you. - Okay, I'm here, I'm here! Yay! - I see you. I see you. I see you. - Good! That's good. I'm glad. I'm glad! - All right, well don't shout. Don't- - I'm glad. I'm right here. - What? - I'm not shouting. I just wanna... I said, I'm not shout- - Keep the noise down. - Shouted. I just want to know that you can hear me. I just want- - No. - I wanted to tell you... - What? - I wanted to tell you that I love you! That I love you! - What? - I wanted to tell you that I love you, Mama. (sighs) - I heard you the first time. I just... I wanted to hear it again. (mellow instrumental music) - [Lupe] Listen, Mrs. Ruth, go to the table by your desk. We just put it there. It's been sterilized. Mrs. Ruth? (Ruth laughs) There you are. I'm gonna put on the Teledoc right now. - [Ruth] Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait a minute. - [Lupe] No, no, no. I'm right here. - Oh, okay. I see, I see. Okay. - Mrs. Ruth? Slide it a little bit. Yeah, there you go. - Okay. (laughs) Hello there, Lupe. - Hello! Hi! - How do I look? You look muy bonita. - Muchos gracias, Lupe. - Okay, get settled, and I'm gonna connect you right now, okay? - Yeah, okay. - There you go. (computer chiming) - Good morning! Good morning, Mrs. Berg. - I approve. - I'm sorry? - I'm Lupe. I'm Lupe Ramirez, Ruth's home health aid. And I'm just here to- - Lupe is my best friend, but she, you know, talks. - I'm Dr. Patel. - [Ruth] I know! - I wonder if you can tell me what seems to be the trouble today? - I think it's better to be honest, right? - Yeah, always. - Yes. - Yes. You're beautiful. You're better than your picture. You really are. - (laughs) And I see your next appointment's gonna be with your ophthalmologist, Mrs. Berg, gettin' your eyes checked out. - And you're witty, too! You're witty and you're beautiful. I bet your patients are just all over you. - That's very kind. (Lupe laughs) I think they've had enough of me, to be honest. What can I do for you today? - Nothing. I mean- (interposing voices) I'm doing this for Lupe. There is- - Mrs. Ruth? Come on. We spoke about this. - Lupe is a worrier. Always lookin' for trouble. Yes, yes. - Could you tell me something about your travel history recently, Mrs. Berg? - Well, I have no trouble. Everything is fine. But- - Travel. Dr. Patel said, "Travel history". - Oh! - Thank you, Lupe. - My recent travel? - Yes, please, yeah. - Well, I go from here to the bedroom, and from the bedroom to the bathroom, and then I... I'm back here again. I don't go anywhere. - Mrs. Ruth has been on lockdown for the past five weeks. - Okay. And your contact history, Mrs. Berg? - I contact no one. A man in a mask and gloves gives me my meals. I haven't seen Lupe in days. I don't touch anyone. I don't even touch myself. I'm contactless. - You know, it sounds like you're having trouble completing sentences sometimes. Are you always this out of breath? - Well, it didn't hurt Marilyn Monroe. Remember "Happy Birthday To You"? - Okay, can we- - Yeah. - This is important. Are you single? Because I have a daughter, and the two of you would be lucky. - I'm sure you'd think I wasn't good enough for your daughter, if she's half as peaceful as you are, Mrs. Berg. - Oh. Well, thank you. - I think it's important that we speak frankly. - [Ruth] Sure, yes. - She's not feeling well. She has a fever. - Well, I'm a hot person. I'm hot. I'm especially hot when I'm talking to someone like you. (Ruth coughs) - That's it. That's the cough. - Oh, please! It's a little cough! There's no cough. - Why don't you tell me about your feet? - What? My feet? - I understand there's some concern about your feet. - My feet are fine. Thank you very much for asking. - Tell the truth, Mrs. Ruth. - The truth is, that I'm really more attractive from the waist up. That is the truth. - There's not much I haven't seen, Mrs. Berg. If you don't show me, I can't help you. - [Ruth] I don't think you understand. - Okay. - I don't want your help. I mean, I'm doing this for Lupe. She wants me to talk to you, and you are a cute guy. - Mrs. Berg, this is your foot, right? - Lupe, audios. - I'm sorry, Mrs. Ruth. I had to. - Oh, don't be sorry, dear. You're fired. - [Dr. Patel] This is your foot, right, Mrs. Berg? - No. Why are you asking me that question? - Well, because I need to know. I'm not there to examine with you, so I need to know this is definitely your foot, because I'm very concerned with what I see, Mrs. Berg. - It's my foot! It's my foot, all right? It's my foot. - I'm very concerned by what I can see. What I can see is, purple toes with red lesions that strongly suggests what we now call COVID toe, Mrs. Berg. (iPad clatters) Now, if it were just your feet alone, but factoring in your cough and your fever, I think you're gonna need to go to the hospital. - Let me explain something to you. Nothing's going to happen to me. This little bug isn't gonna get me. I am like a cockroach. I am very hard to kill! I am not going to the hospital! - Please, Mrs. Ruth? Please, please? - I am not going to the hospital! - I don't think you understand quite how serious this is, Mrs. Berg. You're having trouble breathing. - Let me tell you this in two languages, in Spanish and in English. No and no! No, no! Okay, do you understand? No! (computer lid slams shut) - This is a great start. (intense booming) - Yay! - Let's turn it down. Please? (explosion blasting) - Hey, guess what? - Mom! - What? - Marco saw Carmen last night. They touched. - That's really stupid and scary. - What? Absolutely not. We are young and we are strong, okay? Kids aren't gettin' it like old people. - But that's not true. A lot of kids in New York are getting it in really weird ways. - You know what I read, actually, that kids are hookin' up. They're finding ways. - Yeah, yeah, yeah! Mm-hmm. - Can I play louder? - I'm gonna tell mom. Stop, seriously! - Ahh! - Jesus, what is... You wanna turn that down? - Jose, I'm babysitting. - [Lupe] Frieda (speaks in Spanish)? (Frieda speaks in Spanish) (Lupe speaks in Spanish) - I'm right here watching him. (Lupe speaks in Spanish) (door thuds shut) (Mateo speaks in Spanish on computer) - Okay, okay. (car door chiming) (Lupe speaks in Spanish) (Mateo speaks in Spanish) Okay, (speaks in Spanish). Perfecto! (Lupe speaks in Spanish) (Mateo speaks in Spanish) - Huh? (Lupe speaks in Spanish) (Mateo speaks in Spanish) (Lupe speaks in Spanish) (Mateo speaks in Spanish) (bags rustling) (Mateo speaks in Spanish) Sí, Mama. - Perfecto! - Yeah. - [Jose] God, it's been so long! - Wait, wait, you gotta calm down. - I can't calm down. - [Frieda] No, you gotta calm down. - I don't wanna look at porn again. - Then don't! - What do you do? I'm gonna have to, if you don't send me a little somethin'. I need a picture. - No! No, you don't! - Yes, I do. I need a picture so that I can picture. Yes, I do. - No, pictures end up everywhere. I'm not doing that, so don't ask. - I'm just saying, other guys got girls that are sendin', but I'm not askin'. - That's good, because you ain't gettin' it. (Mateo speaks in Spanish) (Lupe speaks in Spanish) - Grandpa! (pounding on door) (Mateo speaks in Spanish) - He probably has the TV on. (Lupe speaks in Spanish) Can you see? - No, (speaks in Spanish). - Something's wrong, papi. - [Mateo] No, no, no, no. (Mateo speaks in Spanish) - Yeah. - Okay? (Mateo speaks in Spanish) - What if you maybe just like showed me a little something over- (Frieda speaks indistinctly) - My little brother is right next to me. I do not wanna scar him for life, so no. No. - You- You could take your phone in the bathroom? - No, that's not happening. Use your imagination. - Fine, fuck it, I'll use my imagination. - Okay. Feel free. (chuckles) - (inhales loudly) Okay. - Can you open your eyes? - I'm picturing the picture that you could send me, and damn! - (giggles) You're so dumb. Did you do your math homework yet? - Oh, my god! Fuck that stupid ass math homework! This shit isn't natural! I'm gonna fucking explode! - Okay. - Fuck, I'm sorry. I don't wanna be one of those fucking asshole guys. A: it's just, I don't know, I really fuckin' miss you. - Yeah? - Okay. (door rattling) (Lupe speaks in Spanish) (window screen clatters) (Lupe speaks in Spanish) - Okay. (bag thuds) See, Mom? (Mateo grunts) (feet shuffling) Abuelo?! (footsteps pattering) Mom? (shower curtain rustles) (Mateo speaks in Spanish) Abuelo! It's Mateo! Mom, he's not here, okay? - You have this, like, smell, this, like, flower smell, and I miss that shit. I miss you. - I miss you, too, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot. - I mean, are we ever gonna get to see each other again? And, like, if we do, then when? - Yeah. - Like, not knowin' is really fuckin' with me. I can't fuckin'... - Hey! - Get in your car, (speaks in Spanish). - Okay. Okay, okay, okay. (Lupe speaks in Spanish) (Mateo speaks in Spanish) (camera shuffling) - Okay. Hello? - Hey, look at me. So put the camera on your face, like all the way to your face. Mm-hmm. (melancholic dramatic music) Okay. Can I see your eyes? - Okay, not as pretty as yours. (melancholic dramatic music continues) (Frieda chuckles) (Lupe speaks in Spanish) - [Lupe] He's gotta be around somewhere. (Lupe speaks in Spanish) (Lupe and Mateo chattering in Spanish) Okay? - [Mateo] Mami? (chuckles) (Mateo speaks in Spanish) - What is he doing?! (Lupe speaks in Spanish) (Mateo speaks in Spanish) (Grandpa Alfredo speaks in Spanish) (Mateo speaks in Spanish) (Lupe speaks in Spanish) (Lupe laughs) (Mateo speaks in Spanish) Gracias. (Mateo speaks in Spanish) You are my knight and shining armor. I love you (speaks in Spanish). - [Mateo] I love you! Te quiero, Mama, mira. (upbeat mellow music) (phone ringing) (phone chimes on) What? (moans) What happened? - Bad dream. - Okay. Well, I'm up. I'm here. What's wrong? - Just keep having this feeling like something bad is gonna happen. I just don't know what. - Okay. - "Okay", that's it? That's all you got? - I don't wanna say the wrong thing. - Well, saying nothing is the wrong thing. Just sittin' there lookin' all stupid, that's the wrong thing. - Okay, right? (Mateo stammers) Now I'm free to saying the thing that I would've said, if I had said it before. I don't know. - Just made the bad thing a worse thing. - No! Hey, look. Okay. (clears throat) How's this? I think the thing for me, - Mm-hmm. - when I worry about something, it's never the thing I should've worried about. Yeah? That thing, the the bad thing that you think, it won't be that thing. - Okay. Okay, it won't be that thing. - Yeah? - Yeah, that's right. But it will be something, you know? - You had it. - What? Yeah. - You had it! I was in a good place, - I had- - and you just... - Really? - You overtalked it! Yes! - I'm sorry, I always do... I always do this. I always do this. - It's better- No words are coming from me. - I suck! I'm sorry. - It's always there, quiet-like, like something bad is coming. I just... I don't know what. - Hey, what's happening right here, right now, it's not bad. - It's just gonna get very bad. I know it. - Water? - What? - I would bring you water if I was there with you. A cool glass of water. - Really? - I would do that for you. - Ah, I can do that. I can do that. Come, come, walk with me. (light switch clicks) You know when you look up at the light, and you see those little flecks, (fridge door clatters open) but you don't always notice it? I mean, but they're always there. (fridge door clatters shut) Or like the refrigerator, how it's always making a noise, but you don't always hear it. That's how this bad feeling is.

"Love songs are scarce and fall into two categories, the frivolous and liked, and the sad." "Of deep successful love there is ominous silence, and in these songs, there is a depth of history and meaning." "The soul hunger is there, the restlessness of the savage, wail of the wanderer, and the plaint is put in one little phrase: my soul wants something new, something new."

Now you can see- - Hey, step back! - The police are really (phone ringing) getting adamant about clearing the street. (phone continues ringing) (door slams shut) - Hey, Daddy. - Hey, babe. - Sorry, my phone was off, so I'm just seeing your text. - Okay, why was it off? - Do you need anything? Is everything okay? - (chuckles) I don't know. You tell me. - I'm okay. You just called me a lot of times. - What you up to? - Doin' my thing. - Okay, and what's that? What's your thing? - Out and about, meetin' up with some friends. - One of my newbies texted me a picture with a message that said, "Is this yours?" It's a picture of a young woman, kinda looks like you, from a rally. But if you say it wasn't you, then it wasn't you. - I didn't say that. - "Out and about", you said. Look, I'll just text him back and say, "Not my daughter", 'cause she would never. - Daddy, I didn't march when the marches started out of respect for you. - And I appreciate that. - But the police keep... It keeps happening, so I can't not be out there. So yes, I've been in a rally. Don't be mad. - (sighs) I'm not mad. - Are you coming? - [Audre] You're not? (Leon sighs loudly) - So are you okay? Are you safe? - I'm great. - Oh, then I'm relieved. - And it felt great. Really peaceful, beautiful, for three hours. - Not according to the news. - Oh, well, the news, I'm sure, is distorting it. It was three hours of peace and happy, all ages, races, hope, and possibility. And it only got ugly at the end. - Okay, look, just as long as you're safe. And I understand you had to do that. You needed to get that outta your system. - Get what out? - You know what I'm sayin'. Just come on home now. - But that was just the rally. The march is about to start. - And it will go on without you. Just come home. We'll discuss it when you get here. - I'm not a child anymore. - Look, I'd wanna be out there, too, and I was. After Rodney King, you bet I was out there. And if I was your age, and I didn't know what I know now, I'd be right there beside you. I don't want you to march. I know how wrong this can go. - Okay, well, I'll be careful. - (scoffs) Even then. - I'll carry my sign. I really like my sign. I'll just hold it. I'll be chanting. - Chantin' what? - "Black lives matter", because we do. - "No justice, no peace", will you chant that? - Definitely. - "Take to the streets?" "Fuck the police?" - I'm not leading the chant. - But you'll join in? - That's the point. That's what it's about. Everyone being one voice. Everyone being united. - You'll chant, "Fuck the police?" - But I'm not protesting you. - Feels that way. May as well just reach inside me and rip out my heart. You know, all the sacrifices, workin' the overnights, working my doubles, sleeping on a precinct couch, missin' holidays, birthdays, all so I could provide anything that you needed. - I'm sorry. Is this about my safety or your pride? Are you being a cop right now or are you being my dad? - Can I be both? - I don't need another cop! I need my dad to trust me. - I do. - It doesn't feel like that right now. - I trust you. - So you don't trust the police? - I don't trust this moment. After 9/11, we were heroes. But now, we just go out there, and we're just targets, and we're just the same people doing the same job. - But you are not the same. If all cops were like you, nobody would wanna protest. - I'm telling you, we are stressed. We're stretched thin. Fuses are short. I do not want you to get hurt! - Then call your fellow officers, call your precinct captain, text, email, tell them, tell them, do not tear gas my daughter! Do not fire rubber bullets at her friends. Tell them that we come in peace, and we want them to do better, which is why I'm gonna go march now. - I'm begging you not to. - When those planes hit the towers, did you run home to me and mom? - You ran, I don't know how many blocks, toward the towers. You ran toward trouble, and you did your part, because that's who you are. That's who you taught me to be. Now, I've written your number big on my arm and on my leg. I've got my ID in my bra. I've got snacks. I made peanut butter and jellies for my friends. And I can use this bag as a shield. And I got.... - Dre. - I got... I got saline solution. - Dre, please. - And I got goggles. Boom! - Dre- - I'm prepared. You know why? - Why? - Because I'm my father's daughter. - Audre, come on. - I'm comin'! Two seconds. - Call me when you're done. - Love you. - Love you, too. - No justice! - Y'all ready? - [Protestors] No justice, no peace. - Mom was famous for her frugality. She accounted for every penny, but she had her reasons. Oh, I've raised a boy who's gonna need lots of therapy. (Dr. Berg speaks in foreign language) Now my boy's grown up to be a therapist. Oy vey! (laughs) I feel like I'm doing a standup routine about my mother. I'm not trying to be funny. I don't find this funny. But she was... She was funny. She was so goddamn funny. (sniffs loudly) In my line of work, I meet with a lot of families, and I've come to believe that there are two types of mothers. Those that don't love you enough, and those that love you too much. My mother was of the latter variety. Her parental crime, she was guilty of too much love. And I'm only just now coming to realize that that is my favorite kind of love. I don't understand why. This virus, (softly sobbing) I don't understand it. Well, she came very far, and for her to end this way. I asked the rabbi, "Will God forgive me for not being there to help ease my mother's passage?" "Will God forgive me?" And the rabbi said, "I'm not God, but I work for him, and I forgive you". Thank you, Mom, for giving me such a wonderful hello. I just wish I could have given you a better goodbye. And now I know somebody else wanted to speak. (sniffs loudly) (somber instrumental music) - So I'm at the farmer's market, that girl from last summer, she's got a lot of questions about you. "Oh, how's Elliot?" "When's he coming out?" Elliot? (water rushing) Elliot? (uptempo rock music) - [Elliot] Coming, Mom. What's up? - You know, this isn't a nag, sweetie, but a little water on the ficus would be a good thing. Just keep the soil- - Will do! Do not worry, all right? (feet clomping) (Elliot thuds) Oh, my toe! - Are you okay? - Yeah, just slippery when just wearing socks. (Elliot pants heavily) Look at you! There you are. Look at you. - Hello, sunshine! - Hey, Mama. - Oh, honey, you look great! So rested and handsome. - I feel good, Mom. I do, I do, I do. Wait till you hear why. - [Grace] Can you get your sister? - She's busy. - [Grace] Well, can you get her? - I don't think that's a good idea. - Hello! (John chuckles) - Hey, Pop! - No, I'm just asking about Maggie. - She's with the boyfriend. They're mid-coital. - What? - They're slappin' skin, and from the sound of it, it is going really well. - Okay, okay. (Elliot laughs) - Cheer up! She's happy, (spray bottle spritzing) and I know you want your kids to be happy, right? - So how's it going with you? - Better. And I have so much to share, so buckle up. (John coughs) Ooh, cover that, Pops. (John continues coughing) - Honey, do you want me to bring you some tea? - Just some seltzer, please. - Seltzer? Okay, one seltzer coming up. - Good for you, though, keeping your distance, doing your part. - [Grace] Fill us in, honey. - I am doing so good. Okay, I admit, I was struggling, but not anymore. Just had to get my thinking right, the whole idea of essential workers and just being essential. Is that not one of the most beautiful words? Right up there with caramel and lavender? I don't know. But anyway, we think this is terrible, right? This is 9/11 bad. It's Chernobyl-like. "Worse than war", some guy on TV said, because it's invisible. Like you, like everybody, I have my moments of doubt, where it's like, the fuck is goin' on? And then suddenly, there is clarity, and it's... Hello? Mom? Dad? Hello? This is important. - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. - Hear me? - Mm-hmm, yeah, I hear you. - Okay, look, I think... I think we've been thinking about this all wrong. There is opportunity here. We just don't see it yet. We're incapable of seeing it, because we think how things were is how they're supposed to be. Maybe this is just a way to take problems, and Obi-Wan them into possibilities. Maybe we can take obstacles, and shape shift them into opportunities? - And you thought this when? - It hit me when I was taking the biggest shit of my life with a Paul on the road to Damascus clarity. - I don't need to hear about your- - What, my shit? My shitting? (Elliot laughs) - Hey, your mother's right. That is an image nobody needs. - Oh, you need truth. Nobody needs the truth, Dad! - Elliot, make your point. - Okay, my point. It all comes down to one simple word, or rather, a preposition of words. That is two words? - The preposition also counts. - Fine, fuck, whatever! Are you ready for my two words? - How's your sleep been? - Why are you asking? - You have a bit of an edge. - Nope, no, this is good. This is me being excited, because we've been thinking about it like it's terrible. But there is good here. Goats are running free. Those pandas fucked for the first time in, like, a decade. And maybe we've been the reason that hasn't been happening more often. So at any- - Honey, honey, honey, you're talking so fast. (Elliot speaks indistinctly) No, honey, it's hard to understand. Just... - El, have you been regular with your meds? - Okay, look on your screen. I'm gonna share an image with you. Do you see that? - Mm-mmm. - Nope. - No. - Fuck! Okay. Okay! Just picture a... Just picture a model wearing a bikini, and a matching face mask. (drawer slams) Okay? I give you... Drum roll, please. The trikini! Do you see that? A woman in Italy thought it up as a joke, but not only is it not funny, it is next-level genius. - So how does this- - I'm looking for my trikini! - Your trikini? - Yes! - So what's your idea? - My idea, and this is early, is to find my idea. - Okay. - Don't use that... Don't use that tone. I can hear it, your judgment, your fucking critical voice. - I'm not criticizing. - No, but you are about to. - No, no, I'm not. - No, you know you are. I'm trying here to find some modicum of hope, and it's... (groans) What am I saying? I am saying, that I had the trikini. I had this thought a week ago. It's in my notebook. - No, no, you didn't. - You're calling me a liar? - No. - We've been here before, buddy. Uber, Airbnb. - Those were both ideas that I had just in a general sense, you know? - (sighs) Yeah. - I'm just... - Sweetheart? (Elliot speaks indistinctly) Elliot? - No, you can't get past my past, can you? It's like no matter what I do to try to show you that I am... Where did Dad go? - He's making a call. - Who is he... Who is he calling? - Sweetheart, we love you very much. - Oh, I bet he's calling Dr. B. Now, I bet he's calling Dr. B to up my meds. - Well, it's just obvious when you don't take them. - Yeah, but what's the... What's the problem, Mom? I'm... What's the problem? I'm excited, right? I'm hopeful. But now, not so much, because of you. - Elliot? Sweetheart, just slow down. Okay? - No, but it's not... I'm in a flow state, Mom. I'm vibing, and thoughts are tumbling, and it's just, I mean, lightning in a bottle! You wanna catch this, don't you? Don't you? - You're just very agitated. - No, I am seeking purpose. And just because it makes you a little bit uncomfortable, it doesn't mean that- - I'm just trying to keep you grounded. Remember? - Yes, absolutely. I'm totally... Yes, (stammers) I wanna be grounded, too. But I feel - Right? - you're trying to keep me down, which you can't do, because the trikini, Mom. I'm telling you, the trikini, it's everything! It accepts this is happening. It makes a day at the beach not only possible, but appealing. Do you know what I mean? The trikini will save lives, Mom. I'm not... Oh, he's back! - So, okay, Dr. Berg will be joining. We want him here. (Elliot sighs) - I knew it, I knew it! Yeah! - He just wants to check in. - No, no. I don't need Doctor- - He just wants to check in. Your mom and I can sign off. - Oh, no, no, honey, I can't sign off. I'm the host. - Okay, obviously, you guys don't know what the fuck you're doing, so maybe just take care of that? (computer chimes) - Hello, everyone. Hey, Elliot. Where are you guys? - Hey, Dr. Berg. Thank you so much. John and I are in the country. He's symptomatic and immunocompromised, so we thought it'd be best if we- - Decamped. They've decamped to the Hamptons. I'm at home. - Home alone? - No, my sister's here on the top floor. She's currently fucking her boyfriend. - So I think John and I are just gonna mute ourselves, and then point the camera towards the ceiling. - No, it's- - Yeah, let the two of you- - No, this is- - Great. So... Hey. - Hey. - Tell me what's going on. - Oh, I was good until my parents started, you know, (scoffs) freaking out. - Yeah, you've been doing real good. You had a couple of months of steady. Did something happen? - No, I've just been eating a lot of bats, you know? - Elliot? - Okay, here's something that didn't bother me. I'm walking down my street, okay? Sidney Place, the street of my whole life. I've got my mask on and my rubber doctor gloves. And this man yells at me, "Go back to where you came from!" But this is not my first time with this, and I'm chill, and I kill him with kindness. And I say, "Thank you so much!" "That's where I'm going right now." And I point to my parents' house, and I say, "That's where I'm from". And then he shouts, "No, I mean, go back to China, you fucking gook!" - I'm sorry that happened, Elliot. - Dude, that... No, my point is, that didn't bother me! I'm not even Chinese! I was chill the whole time. I'm just saying that, what is fucking with me right now is the meds, right? They just... They kinda... They keep me down. They suck out all my energy, and that's what I need! That's what the world needs! Because there is a revolution happening in the streets right now, and I am a potato on a fucking couch here, watching it all happen on TV screens! And Black lives matter, right?! Not my fucking meds! So I just wanna... I just wanna march! I just wanna be essential! Do you see... Do you understand what I'm saying, though?! - You already are, Elliot. - No, but these meds aren't helping! - Listen, listen to me, listen to me. - No, I don't... I don't wanna... I'm not gonna take my meds. I'm not gonna take my meds. - Okay, I get it. I get it. - No, you don't! - Okay, you're right, I don't. You're right. But work with me here. Okay? What about just the Ativan? It would help you with sleep, and it would help steady things, and you could march. And if not for you, for your parents. Look, sometimes when we can't do something for ourselves, it helps to try for the people that we love. Do you understand that? Elliot? - I a trying. I'm trying so hard. - [Dr. Berg] I see that. - Yeah, I'm in. Yeah, okay, sure. Yeah, it's fine. - Good. Thank you. - No, thank you, thank you. That's great. - Okay, I'd like to bring your parents back. Okay? - Okay. I'm gonna grab... - Okay, we're here. - We just caught the tail end of that. - (sniffs) I was listening the whole time. - He's agreed to the Ativan. - Which is good. It's a start. - Yeah. - But... will that take care of- - Yeah, it's the one he's most likely to take. So it's good. (John exhales loudly) - Hey! What are you saying? - [Dr. Berg] I was just filling in your folks. - [Grace] Yeah, we're just getting you back on track, sweetie. That's all we're doing. - Yeah, sure, it's good. How many? - Just one. - Okay. (pills rattling) These? - Elliot. - Just one. - Elliot! No, no, no! No, no! - Elliot! Elliot! - Oh, god! - Elliot, spit that out. - Get those out of your mouth, Elliot! - Elliot, I'm telling you- (interposing voices) - Spit it out. Honey, those will- - Grace! Grace! - Oh, Jesus! - Call 9-1-1. - John! - John, John, do you have a neighbor? - I'll call! - Margaret's upstairs. - Call Tony and Joe. - Call Margaret. - No, call Tony and Joe! (mellow instrumental music) - Hi, I'm Jackie. - I'm John. - Hi, I'm Tony. - Mags. - Amy. - Rhymes with bags. - Hi, I'm Trey. - Hi, I'm Jim, a grateful member of the program. - [Group] Hi, Jim. - Hi. You guys can just call me by my new name, Ben's dad. Nah, not really trying to be funny even. That's my... I guess maybe I'm trying to be funny. I don't know. I used to have a penis. Sorry if that's triggering. - So, yeah, so I'm still furloughed. My wife is now the sole breadwinner-maker-person. And I'm just Ben's dad, which is great, because that's what I always said that I wanted to be, and now I am. And we found out that they're actually not going back to school this fall. It's gonna be online again, so that's... I'm the babysitter, and the tutor, and the homeschool facilitator. I don't arrange play dates, because I am the play date. And I know that this is a, you know, never again to be had opportunity that I will always treasure and appreciate. - Dad? - Yeah? - [Ben] I need you! - Buddy, this is daddy time. - There's no toilet paper! - Okay! Hang on. - I'm not grateful. I'm so mad. - I'm really glad that I can get to this meeting, because my attitude is bad. - You know, it's a day at a time. Some days... Some days it's an hour at a time. - I'm okay. - But- - I have food. I'm in a stable place. - And, of course, there's different work. - I'm- You know, but where my war is is in my brain. - I understand. - Today, I'm really- - Just hug somebody. (interposing voices) Just not having human touch, it's driving me crazy! (interposing voices) (interposing voices continue) - Hi, I'm Grace, and I'm an alcoholic. - Hi, Grace. - Hi, Grace. - Hey, Grace. - Grace. - Hi, Grace. - (exhales loudly) I really don't wanna share this. A couple of car wrecks. Plenty of bad decisions. I mean, I almost died twice. Nothing could stop me from drinking until I got pregnant with my first kid. Only that could bring me here. I couldn't do it just for me, it seems. So 27 years, one day at a time, sometimes with white knuckles, I did it with God's help. But then when... When my boy, my baby, swallowed every pill ever... I'm here taking care of my husband. I mean, I can't even go to the hospital. The hours were endless not knowing if he was going to pull through, but he did. He made it, and he's a miracle. And to celebrate, I got drunk. (sobbing) At least he's here, you know. He's here and shaky, but he's here. And I got one day. - Oh, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Ben, Ben, Ben! Ben. - Is it... Oh, she's there! Hi. - Oh, hi! - Hey! - It sounded like it went really well. - Yeah, how was it? - It took a bit, but I think very... We're gonna get there. - Yeah. - I could tell from listening, - Yeah. - and he really liked you. - Yeah. - Yeah. Can I just say somethin'? We're gonna teamwork this and bring out the power that's all of us. Look out world! Here comes Ben. That's what I'm saying. - We feel really good about his study space. - Okay. - There's really gonna be so much learning that happens, I think. - Yeah, I mean, it makes me wanna learn. The space, it's- - Yeah, I mean we'll probably have to unlearn some things. - Yeah, yeah. - Great! - You know, it's to make room for more learning. - Oh, that's so cute! 5th grade- - Thank you so much! Yes, it feels important to start strong. - Good. I think we feel really good about it. - Me, too. - Let's do this! - Yes! Yeah! (somber instrumental music) - Hi, so we just wanted to check in. We don't wanna be those parents who don't check in. - Did you show her the chart? - No, no, she doesn't need to see the chart. - Oh, she's gotta see the chart! - The thing that we're having a problem with- - You gotta see this chart. (Cindy chuckles) Okay? No, seriously, the color coding alone, this thing is a work of art. - Yeah, this part's a joke. (interposing voices) - It's a lovely chart. - So the thing that- - Tell her about the- - I am. That's what I'm trying to do right now. - No, the one there's maps. What's that? - Geography? - Yeah, geography, (Cindy speaks indistinctly) what about a project that's about all the places we're gonna go when we can go places project? - We can do that. Yes? Okay, he needs you. - Yes! - Go, go, go! We- (phone chiming) The thing that we're having trouble with is when we... Sorry, one second. (keyboard clacks) (Cindy shushing) (laughs and snorts) These people! I'm sorry. That was so rude. Okay. (objects clattering) You were saying? - Okay, so this is not fifth grade math. - It's fifth grade math. - No, this cannot be fifth grade math. This is harder than what I did in high school. - My husband's smart, but just more street than school. - You know what? Actually, now that I have you both, actually, I've been noticing Ben's homework is starting to- - What, it's more ebb - What? - than flow? Come on, Ben! It's time! - It's- Yes, it's more ebb, mm-hmm. - [Cindy] You know, we did... Just finished this last night. I helped a little bit. - That's more than a little bit. - Ben did all the gluing. - Mm-hmm. - What? He did the glue! - Yeah, he did the glue. (somber instrumental music) Sorry, sorry, sorry! Ohh! (sighs loudly) Hi! Do you mind? - Oh! Oh, please indulge. - [Cindy] You look like you could use some? - Well, yes. Still at work, though. So where is the little guy? - Ben is not coming. - I was hoping to hear him read what he wrote. - Yeah, that's not gonna be happening. - I'm sorry, he didn't do the assignment, or- - Cheddar. - What? - I asked for cheddar goldfish. - [Cindy] Okay, not now. - [Jim] We bought two of the pretzel. He doesn't like the pretzel. - Sorry, you were saying? - So did he not do the assignment? - No, he did it. He absolutely did the assignment. He more than did the assignment. - So may I see it? - I have a question. So are the other kids learning anything, or is it just Ben that appears to be regressing? - Whatever he wrote will be fine. - Really? Because everyone gets a gold star? - At this point, keeping them engaged seems like a win. So it's not so much what he writes, just that he writes. - Oh, well, he wrote a tome. I mean, for a nine-year-old, it's rather epic. - Wonderful! - I mean, I started to read it, but I had to stop. "What home life looks like now", help me understand your thinking with that. - Well, it's a personal essay. It's just a prompt. And these kids are very creative when they're given the freedom. - Oh, yeah. "My dad, he's fun", that's creative. "We do lots of fun things." Nevermind that, I mean, that I come up with all the fun things while I work full time, so that him and his furloughed father can do the fun things that I come up with now. - Okay. You know, I'm not gonna read it to you. - Yeah, it's gonna be difficult for me to assess his progress. - Okay, well, fine. Here's a morsel. "My mom's mean." (exhales loudly) "She's a meanie." I mean, is meanie (laughs) even a word? - Well, maybe not officially, but there's a clarity there. - What? I'm sorry, that you admire? - These kids have a lot of pent up thoughts and feelings that they might not know what to do with, or that they even have, or what to do with what could be massive or overwhelming emotions. They're missing their friends. They're missing recess. Things are just harder. So I was thinking that it could be an opportunity for expression. - Yeah, well, it's not like this at all, you know, what he's writing. - Well, that's not the point. - So what, you're teaching them to distort, or to lie? I'm so confused. - Just to express. - Cause he could say, "I have the most horrible mother in the history of the world", and could accuse- - Yes, as long as Ben's doing the writing then- - I mean, he crimes of the- I mean, if I were you, and I read this letter, I might call Child Protective Services, you know? And that really hurts, because I am... I'm doing my best. - I am sure you are. I have- - Yeah, I don't think you understand. - I think everybody, right now, is going through some dark phases, and I don't know a single parent who isn't having these dark moments, and it's very common. - Hun, I mean, you're not a therapist, right? I mean, you're not trained to take a child apart. - I'm not taking your kid or anybody's kid apart. - But I mean, you kind of are! I mean, how 'bout you just do some simple, doable math? Something concrete. Multiplication, memorization, memorize state capitals, or memorize past corrupt presidents. - You know, in the beginning, I tried to pretend like this is normal, and smile, and just keep smiling. And in my experience, every fifth grader knows a fuck lot more than we give them credit for! - Okay! (Bridget speaks indistinctly) "It's going bad!" "My mom's really mixed up." "She's all stressed out." "We took some time out so she could figure out stuff." "I'm telling you, it's bad." "My mom breaks things." "She bites her hand so that she doesn't hit me!" "She slammed a door and a picture fell off the wall, a picture of me, and her, and my dad smiling." "Glass went everywhere." "My parents scream at each other all the time." "I can tell everybody in the neighborhood can hear them." - And is there more? - Oh, that's not enough? - It depends on Ben, and whether he wrote more. - Yeah, he wrote more. - Right? - He wrote more. "And when my mom hurts..." - Okay. - "And when my mom hurts, the whole world hurts, and I am just trying to figure out how to save my world." (Cindy exhales loudly) (Cindy sniffs) Yeah, that's good, so. (mumbles) He's a good writer, huh? - He's really good. - Jim! He's a fuckin' poet. Right? - That's really... I mean, that is powerful. That's powerful stuff. - Jim, come here for a second! (Bridget chuckles lightly) - I mean, you... I mean, this was- - Geez! - I mean, we should clank. That was a- (Bridget laughs) - Oh, yeah! I mean, I have- - I mean, not now! I know you're working. (Bridget speaks indistinctly) I mean, you- - Right. - You earned this. Read this. (paper crinkling) (cud thuds) (Cindy exhales loudly) We got a fuckin' poet in the house! - Sister? - Brother! Is it straight? How's it look? - Raise the left side. (chuckles) I'm always fighting for the left. - [Bridget] Ahh! Is that... How's that? - It's better. Hey, I'm glad that you're the first person signed in, because we have to talk. - [Bridget] How have you been? - Busy, you know, work with the election coming. - Yep. Me too. I mean, busy. This online learning is- - Hey! Can I just say, you are as near to a perfect person as I know. - Oh god, where is this going? (Bridget laughs) - There have just been two things in life that have disappointed me. One, that you married a man named Rod. (Bridget laughs) In my circle, it's just not a good name. - Yes, uh-huh, and the second? - You know. - Oh, don't. Not... This is not today. - Just tell me you're not gonna vote for him again? - This is so not the time. - This is very much the time. It's absolutely the time. Are you voting for him again? (sighs) I've tried, and it has been trying, to forgive you for 2016. You had your reasons, or you had Rod's reasons. - This was my vote, and I just shouldn't have told you. - No, I'm glad that you told me, because the truth has been completely now co-opped. - Oh, yes, you and your peers have done a very good job of that. - Oh, okay, fuck it! Can I just... Okay, let me just say, I will forgive you for your misguided vote, if you vow not to make the same mistake again. - Jeff says he is in the waiting room. - Yeah, I know. (phone buzzing) - And Doug and mom. (phone continues buzzing) - Yeah, they are. - Well, let them in. - No, you have to tell me first. - Are you... What, are you, like, holding me hostage? You're not gonna let them in? - Yes, I am. - Dammit! Jeremy, you know how important this is for us. This could be the last time. - Okay, okay! Cue the banjos from deliverance. I give you Tweedledee (computer chimes) and Tweedledum. - Oh! (horn honking) - Hey, finally! What you guys doin'? (interposing voices) - Okay. - We- Hey, Bridget, where's Mom? - Okay, everybody, - Where's mom and Dad? - before we bring Mom in- - Well, I'll be god damned! Look who's here. - Yeah, we were taking bets. We didn't think you had the requisite balls to show up in enemy territory, little brother. - Well, here I am, balls and all, brother. - Okay, well, none of us would be here without Jeremy. He's letting us use his unlimited account. So thank you. - Oh, Mr. Moneybags over here. - (scoffs) It's amazing what's possible when one works. - Yes, guys, this- - Oh, go fuck yourself. - This is exactly what won't- - Oh, you know, you do this once a year, you know. You drop in, and you do your big hero move. - Yeah, who's at her house every other day? Who's bringin' her groceries? - That I pay for. - Who drives her to the doctor? Who holds onto her when she cries after chemo, huh? - Hey, stop! Hey, listen! - Sorry, sorry. - This could very well be her last- - No, no. Stop it! - You watch! - Bridget. - She is gonna outlive us all. - No one would like that more than me. - More than I, I think you mean. - Yes, thank you. We just wanna make this nice for her, okay? So we're gonna stay clear of certain topics, yes? - Yeah. - Absolutely. Absolutely. - Great. - Okay. - Jeremy- - Come on, let Mom in. Let's party. - Jeremy, do the honors. - Yes, I got it. I got it, I got it. Here comes Mom. (computer chiming) - Hey! (horn honking) (Doug cheering) (party horns tooting) - Sorry you had to wait- - Happy birthday to you, Mom! - Oh, there you are. Oh, Jeremy, I was so worried something important came up. - No, Mom, you are the important thing. - She's not a thing. - Oh, my! Just look at the four of you. (coughing) - Mom, remember your big wish for your birthday was to see just us four, no spouses, no grandkids, right? - Well, or Jeremy's girlfriend. What was her name? - Jeremy, just let me look at you. Oh, Jeremy, my son! My sunshine! (Shirlee moans happily) (Dale groans) - I just threw up in my mouth a little. - Just to see my fabulous four all on the same screen, it's just almost too much for this mother to bear. - Aw, Mom! - We love you. - I just wanna sit here and... - And what, Mom? - (stammers) I don't know. What's the word? - Listen? - Well, obviously! I'm looking for- - Enjoy. You wanna enjoy? - [Shirlee] I don't know. - Ask Bridget. She's a school teacher. She knows words. - Okay, well, seeing that this is your special day, and your big wish was to have all four of us together, I think the most appropriate thing to complete your sentence would be, I just wanna- - Stop! Enough! Oh, I could die and rise in the time that you were taking. Jeremy, you tell me. - Well, I think what Bridget was about to say- - No, you go ahead, Jeremy. - I'm all ears. - Bask? You wanna sit back and bask in the sight of all of us. - Oh, you always know just how to say it. (hand tapping) - Wait, Mom. Hey, don't, don't. I got it all set up for you. - Yeah, Mom. - No, no, no, I just wanna make Jeremy big. - Wait, you're gonna mess it up. - No, no, I'm not... (keyboard tapping) Oh, now that's better. Jeremy, are are you still so very busy writing those very important articles that go way, woosh, over my head? - And straight into the trash! (group laughs) - Gross! - I'll be honest, I don't understand your writing most of the time. - Oh, I think you do. - What are we doing? - It's party time! - It is? - Yeah! - Oh, I... You know, I get mixed up sometimes. - Oh, stop, Mom. You're sharper than all four of us combined. - Yeah, Mama, you remember things I don't even remember I forgot. - Dare someone to diagram that sentence. - Hey, let's open your presents! - Let's do that! - Oh, no! - Yeah! - No, no, no, no. - Yeah. - No, no, no. - Let's do it! Yes! - I don't wanna rush in. I wanna... Jeremy, just tell me what... - Bask. - Tell me one more time. - Bask. - Yes, oh, yes, yes, I want to bask. Let your mother bask. What gives me hope is that you four have each other. Someday, hopefully not soon, I won't be around. - Hey, stop that! Not today. - No, no, no, knowing that you have each other, yeah, to help each other, because no one will love you like your family. When it's all said and done, family's all we got. - Mom, you're exactly right. - Of course I'm right! I'm your mother. - Mom, where are you going? - I gonna get my camera. I wanna memorialize this, all of you here. - Hey, come on back! I can just take a screenshot, Mom. - [Shirlee] I'm old-fashioned that way. - Hurry back, Mom! We love you! Hey, when you guys are with her, you're wearing masks, right? - Hey, fuck face. - Mask this. (Dale retching) (Doug coughs loudly) (Dale and Doug coughing and retching) - Here's the thing, dipshit! I don't want anyone to get COVID, including you! - All right, you non-essential motherfucker. (Dale coughing) - [Bridget] Hey! - Okay, you know what? (Doug coughs) Please do us all a favor, when you do get it, just die before November 3rd. - Hey, dammit, Jeremy! - Yep. All right. Boom! Now! - That make you feel like you have superpowers, Doug? - Well, if it repels you, it's workin'. - (laughs) Hey, virtual high five, brother. (Doug grunts) - Still looking. - Hey, Mom? Mom, come on back. - Bridget, tell me you're not voting for him again? - I'm in New Jersey. My vote doesn't matter. - It matters to me! - I am trying to host a nice party for our mother, little brother. - Oh, my god! Bridget, you're voting for him! - Dude, dude, chill! You're ruining the party. - I am out here on the front lines, Bridget. It's a shit show! - (groans) Save it for your fuckin' lefty fake news- - Shut up, Dale! I'm talking to Bridget. - Hey, Mom, come on back. - If you vote for him again- - If I do? - Yeah, if you do. I don't think there's any coming back from that. - Is that a threat? - No, it's not a threat. It's just that's the truth. (Doug speaks indistinctly) - Hey, Jeremy, just leave her alone, all right? - Voter suppression. It's her fuckin' business. (fridge door clatters shut) - (laughs) Exactly! Like where you stick your dick. - Oh, that's so stupid, Doug! That's just so stupid. I can't reason with stupid. At least Dale can string together an argument. - [Dale] Oh, thank you. Albeit, not a coherent one. So really, it's just Bridget. You're my only hope. So what's it gonna be, Bridge? - I'm undecided. - How are you undecided?! You teach children! - Don't let him bully you. - What he has done to education, to the whole idea of truth! - Please, please, not now. Stop! - Bridget, you are the only hope I have left in this fucked up fucking family of ours! - No, you have more than me. You have mom. - Come... She's dying! - Nah, fake news. - If you vote for him, Bridget, we're done! It's over! - Please- - [Jeremy] I will have no family after this! - [Doug] Hey, faggot! - What did you just call me? (gun cocks) (balloon popping) (Doug and Dale laughing) - Hey! Knock it off! (interposing voices) - So fucking gross! - [Shirlee] What the hell is going on here?! (interposing voices) - Because we win! - Did you just shoot your brother? - Sorry, Mom. - Dammit! - Sorry. - Goddammit, you don't shoot your brother! - Ma- - Even if it is pretend, you- - It's just... It's a paintball gun, Mom. He was ruining the party. (stammers) I'm sorry. - Well, it's not like I'm gonna fuckin' remember! Okay. Now I got just one question. Dale, Doug, are you dead? - No. - No. - Mm-mmm. - No. Bridget, Bridget, look. Bridget, you look at me. - Yeah? - Are you dead? - No, Mom. - Jeremy, what about you? - No. - Okay, then here's what we're gonna do next. All of you are gonna look into this camera, and you're gonna give your mother one last smile. Come on. Sweetie. (Jeremy sniffs loudly) - I was sorry, Mom, I can't. - Come on. Did you adjust... Just... You just try. Okay? Everybody, on the count of three. One, two... (camera shutter clicks) (camera whirring) (water trickling) - Hello? Are you listening? - [Russell] Uh-huh, Bush, Gore. - [Jeremy] I was saying, that it's probably gonna happen again, another attempt to steal an election. - Is this really a surprise? - [Jeremy] It just feels like it's never been this bad before, I mean, like, in recent, more dependable times. Whatever. Anyway, big news. - What's up with your new profile pic? - [Jeremy] Oh, you like it? I think we look good. - [Russell] I'm not thrilled, but you were saying? - [Jeremy] I just found out that I'm interviewing one of the leaders of the American Postal Workers Union today. - Mmm, that's fantastic. - [Jeremy] Yeah, it's a huge lead. And he's in the lone purple county of a must win swing state. - [Russell] Why can't I see you? - [Jeremy] Because I want you to hear me. - What are you doing? - [Jeremy] I think sometimes you get distracted by my physical beauty, instead of listening to how stunning my mind is. - (chuckles) No, no, no, I can handle your physical beauty. - [Jeremy] No, you can't. You really can't. I'm too much. All right, here's what you're missing. (footsteps pattering) - Ooh! Maybe I don't wanna look at the ground, or your overpriced running shoes. - [Jeremy] Oh, how's that? - You know what? I'll call you later. - Oh, no, no, no! Look, there are mail crates piling up. We have postal workers going to work to find that their automated sorting machines are disabled, padlocked. And in that same county that I'm talking about, mailboxes, you know, the beautiful blue ones that we all count on, they're being ripped out in the middle of the night. What is it? - I'm just confused. Like, why, at this moment, you- - At this moment, what? - Your profile pic, babe. - I changed it. - I know, to a picture that is mostly me. - Yeah, you look really hot. - It just feels like you're showing off. - (laughs) My attention is on you in that picture. You're my entire focus of it. So how am I showing off? - There's just like a little bit of, look at me, I'm a fucking Black man. - (chuckles) Russell? - Yes? - For me to post a picture- - Oh, oh, for you to post a picture! Is that dangerous or something? - Yeah, actually it is. I'm letting the world know that I'm with you, - Yeah, I don't trust it. The world doesn't care. - Okay, look, if this is gonna be a problem for you, then... (Jeremy groans) I know it's been a hard year for you with your dad, and I don't wanna add... I don't wanna be part of your problem. I wanna be part of your solution. - Please don't! Also, it is so... It's such a good picture of you. It's so much a very good picture of you, and it's not even that great of a picture of me. - That is not the point! You don't own me. - [Jeremy] Oh, my fucking god. Oh, my fucking god. (footsteps pattering) Wow! Really? - Mm-hmm. - Are we gonna have that conversation right now? I'm on a public running trail. Really? - Yes. - Okay. - If not now, when? - Right now, as I'm on the verge of a really important interview? - Did your other boyfriends get a joint profile pic? I'm guessing I'm the first one. - So? - And I'm guessing I'm the only Black one, too. - It has nothing to do with you being Black! Maybe it has everything to do with the fact that you're the first person I've truly loved! - Nice try- - Man, I am saying loud and proud, this is my boyfriend. - And I am not buying it! All of you are scrambling right now. - "All of you!" "All of you!" Who is "all of you?!" You gotta break that down for me, Russell, - All of- - because it's really fuckin' annoying. - Yes, all of the Whites are terrified that you have been exposed, and we all know. We see you. - All right, fine. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. On behalf of me and all of the Whites, I'm so sorry. - I can't. - Look, I have to wrap this up, 'cause I have this interview, all right? Fuck! - Okay. Fine. Hang up. Go do your thing. - No, I'm not hanging up on you. I'm not fucking hanging up on you! I'm not trying to end the conversation, all right? Let's have this out. I can save democracy later. - Oh, please, you are not saving democracy! - All right, well, we all do the best we can. Look, you know that this means a lot to me. - I know. - I- - Yes, I know, I know. - I take pride in the fact that I am one of the good guys. - Oh, I know, I know. - I am fighting a good fight. - You are the Whitest Black person in America, Jeremy. You work with Black people. You have Black friends. You say all the right things. You curate your public disgust, and then you post, and you post, and you post, and you post. And I have not said a single thing about it, because I know you mean well, Jeremy, but it is performative! It is! Just like your fuckin' profile pic! - I'm not flaunting you, Russell. I'm saying to the world, to my family. which is a big fucking deal that you're not even considering right now! You don't see that? - You know, I am calling- I can see it and I'm calling bullshit on it. - All right, well, I have to be on my A game for this interview, and I have to do it soon. So what are we doing? 'Cause I can't do this. I can't go into this interview upset. - Okay, one last question. One last question, Jeremy. You hear that siren? (siren blares in the distance) - Yes. - Jeremy, what do you hear? Because when I hear it, you know what goes through my body? That I'm gonna get killed. That my brother is gonna get seven bullets in his back from some racist cop. That my sister is gonna have her door (distorted audio) down, and shot in her sleep. - Awesome. - Or that some fuckin'... Some cop is gonna put his knee on my- (distorted audio) (Jeremy speaks indistinctly) You know what? Fuck this! - Can you see me? - What? - [Jeremy] I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. Can you just repeat, like, the last five seconds? - Yo, forget it. - Just say it. - No, fuck! - Just repeat it. - No! (distorted audio) - [Jeremy] I didn't hear you! I'm tryin' to hear you! Russell, I didn't hear you. (distorted audio) (mellow instrumental music) (phone trilling) - Come on, you can do it. Just pick up. Pick up, pick up. (phone continues trilling) Hello? Hello? (computer chimes) - [Dionne] Do you know the story behind this? - No. Hey, Mom, I can't see you. - [Dionne] Your father knew I loved it, but it was too expensive, so he went back and made arrangements to pay- - Hey, Mom, I was hoping to talk to you, and not some object. - [Dionne] Don't be mad. - I'm not mad. - [Dionne] Or disappointed. Or make a face. - I'm not. I won't. - I've bad a bit of a setback. How's love? - It's great. - I don't believe you. - We're figuring it out. - I still don't believe you. - No, we're taking a break. I don't know, Mom. Everything is off. - [Dionne] This is not a time. - What? - [Dionne] Oh, you don't need me to tell you what to do. - [Russell] What were you gonna say? - This is not a time to be alone. You see? - What are you doing, Mom? - [Dionne] I wish you were his size. He had such style. - (chuckles) Yeah, he did. Ooh, that dark green velvet blazer, ooh, I would've rock that. (Dionne laughs) (Dionne softly sobbing) - [Dionne] He was my reason. More so than I realized. - You have other reasons. Look, Mom, I get it. I'm hurting, too. He was my dad, and I will never not miss him for a single day. But the way he died, and the fact that he got... - [Dionne] I know, I know, I know. - But you didn't! Don't die with him. (Dionne softly sobbing) He would want you to go on. You know that. - [Dionne] (scoffs) He is not here! - But I am! And I want you to get up. (Dionne groans) - I can't. - Yes, you can. - I can't, Russell. - Just do one thing. It can be a small thing. Just do that one thing until it gets easier. Please, Mom, get up! (Dionne pants heavily) (Dionne grunts) (Dionne pants heavily) Good. Good, and then you can add other things. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, that is all I got. - Okay, I need you to go to the window. - You asked me for one thing, and I did it. - Go to the window, and open the curtain. - No! - Mom, I need you to let the light in, please. - I can't. I'm sorry! - You know, I'm here with you. - No, you are not! - Oh, my god! I am here with you as much as I can be. - Russell, please.
