Oh Gosh. Oh my God. Sheriff, copy? Don't move. Just stay there. Stay there. Stay there. Don't move. Do you copy? Isaac, did you find her, over? She's dead. We got a live one. Elijah Isaac. Just came to check on my patient. Don't you have to be an actual doctor to have patients? Nurses help people too Sheriff. Can't shoot every problem. She awake? I don't know. She's been in bed all day. You have any - Will you back up Isaac? I just want to check on her, okay? She's been through a lot. Hey Christine. Elijah is here to see you. Your nurse from the hospital. Hey Christine. How's the- This junkyard that used to be my teeth? Look, I, understand how frustrated you must feel. But if we didn't wire your jaw shut - I know. I know. Look, It's not for long, okay. Soon, it won't even be a memory. I know it. I'm sorry, I, Thank you. For coming to see me. It means a lot. Too bad you couldn't stay with someone with better fashion sense. You have any other shirts with- out heavy metal bands on them? Or are you still fifteen? Beggars can't be choosers. Well Elijah, unless you came to do something other than insult my taste in music- Yeah, yes, actually, I uh, I brought this. It's the stuff you had with you when you came into the hospital. I know most of your stuff didn't survive the crash so- I figured you'd want this. And you can keep that box too. It's not valuable or anything. Oh, and this. I know it's gonna be hard to eat and stuff and- it' s gonna be a huge strain to talk., especially at first. So I brought you this. What is it? Hey there beautiful. What the hell? It's a - It's a text to talk device. You type it, she says it. Uh, well, I guess I'll go now. Yeah. Elijah. Thanks again. Really. I was just checking her okay? I don't need you to check on me. I got everything under control. Oh, Jesus No, Not quite. I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. I scared you. It's okay. I'm Abraham. I, uh, don't mean to be rude but- Isaac said you needed some space. I'm Christine. Chris. You're Isaac's dad? First and foremost I'm also the minister of our small town. Yeah, I think I heard someone say that. Have you heard anything about our faith? Dad, would you knock it off? I think 2 minutes without preaching is a new record for you. It's okay. Look Christine sorry I didn't introduce you earlier, but you were - you know. Tired. Christine, I do hope you'll join us for dinner later. Dad- What I'm not an idiot. We'll give her a smoothie or something. This old man doesn't get to eat to many meals with pretty young girls anymore. Sorry about him, he's a, he's harmless. Oh, I thought he was sweet. What are those for? Oh, I thought I'd try and bribe you out of your hiding place for a bit. I know Elijah said not to mix alcohol with the pain meds but- I think it will just make them work better. To a speedy recovery. I don't know. I'm, I'm not really in the mood. C'mon. My dad always says "never let a man drink alone". I know it's difficult to talk It's not as hard as Elijah thinks. I don't really need that thing, but uh-it was a nice thought. I mean it's difficult to talk about the accident. You think you can tell me about that night? I- Please. It's my job to look out for the people in this town. That means you to now. I have to understand what happened to this girl. What was she even doing out there? I shouldn't share this. You can't say anything. She's a patient at the hospital. Suicide watch. She was very... troubled. It's a beautiful sunny day here in Gideon, NY. Expect mild temperatures to finally melt that snow. Just in time for our annual community gathering. Ma'am, Ma'am are you okay? Just leave me alone. I, I'm not going to hurt you. I promise. You look sick. Let me help you. I don't know you. I know. I know you're not supposed to take a ride from a stranger, but I'm harmless. I promise. Let me give you a ride. C'mon. Get in. Here. Where you headed? Anywhere that's fine, please just, just drive. Okay. That's a pretty earring. Thanks. My God. Are you okay? I'm fine. Please just go. No, you, oh, you are not okay. I'm fine. Really, I'm fine, please I'm just really hungry. I am taking you to the hospital. No! I am taking you to the hospital. No! You are going to the hospital. No! Everything I owned was in that car. My clothes, my cellphone. You know, if you hadn't agreed to let me stay I, I don't- Please, it's the least I could do. Look, we'll hear from insurance about your car soon and then as for the phone. I know. I know. It'll take a few days. I mean what town doesn't have a cellphone store? It's like I crash landed in Mayberry. Yeah, well, in the meantime isn't there someone you want to call? Maybe a boyfriend? or a parents? Uh, no, uh, there's no one. Um. I think I need to go lay down a little longer. Well, what are you waiting for? We don't know anything about her. Don't make excuses. She could have a boyfriend or a husband out there looking for her. I need more time. Alright. Don't take to long. Hey. Ah, I know you wanted some space, but- I thought maybe you could keep me company at dinner with the old man? Sorry. Wait. Ah, there's our guest. I, I made this drink for you. Elijah's recipe. Fresh fruit and veggies. Hmm. Thank you. It's perfect. Hold on a second now. We've got to pray. Don't you pray dear? I, uh, haven't prayed in a long time. Would you humor an old man? Hail. Hail. The hunt has ended. The meat is on the table. We honor our benefactor who feeds us tonight. And we offer him a share. Great one, accept my gift. And upon my hearth leave your blessings. Amen. Amen. It's a strange prayer. Our town has it's own special kind of religion. Are you religious Christine? I was raised Catholic. Raised? Not anymore? We had a falling out. Well, their loss. I'm grateful to have you here to eat with. Dad. What? It's not like she's going to forget that her jaw is wired shut. How about- we talk to her like a person, and not a wounded bird. It's okay. Eating together is very important. It's why so many religious ceremonies revolve around food. A family that eats together, stays together. See. She gets it. And isn't a religion like a great big family? I guess so. Are you close with your family Christine? I have a brother. We talk sometimes. What about your parents? They are maybe a little too religious. Yes. A little religion goes a long way doesn't it? But you can't judge a religion based on the people who take it to far, you know. What do you mean? Well, I mean... Most people who don't trust religion, don't trust it because they don't understand it. You know the early people, they persecuted the Christians because they thought the whole body and blood of Christ thing meant that they were cannibals. It's true. So, you can't confuse fear with faith. It was really nice having you at dinner. Well, uh, be down the hall if you need anything. Oh. Elijah wanted me to give these to you. In case of an emergency, I guess. Um, okay. Good night. You too. Good night. No. No. In Nomine Patris, et Fili, et Spiritus Sanci. God would not forgive us our sins. We give easement and rest, now to thee. Come not down the lanes for in our meadows. ] And for our peace, we pawn our soul. Did you see what happened to her? She's weak, she needs help. She needs help. We need her around a lot more than she needs us. We need to get on with it. I told you- We don't know what she knows. Who she told. You heard her. She has no one but us now. Oh, hello. Hi. I'm Abbie. Are you a friend of daddys? I... Yes, I was hurt. He's letting me stay here. That's nice. That's a very pretty dress you have on Abbie. Thank you. I didn't even know you were here yesterday. You're so quiet. Daddy told me to stay inside because I was bad. What did you do? Daddy's mad because I went downstairs during worship. Worship. Downstairs? In the holy room. We're not supposed to go in there. Why? What's in there? I'm not supposed to talk about it. Why do you talk with a machine? Because I was in an accident. And it's hard to talk. I didn't want to scare you. I don't think you sound scary. You should use your real voice. Well, thank you. When I grow up will I be pretty like you are? Oh please. You're already very pretty. I have to go now. I'm sorry I woke you up. I'll see you tonight. Yeah, man. Hey Sheriff. Hey. Wait. We're eating here buddy. No, that's okay. Can I help you sir? Yeah, I'm looking for a young woman. She was in an accident here the other day and hospital won't tell me where she is. And, uh, who is she to you? She's my sister. Christine Sinclair. I'm James. She uh, she said she didn't have any family. She doesn't mean literally. Our parents they don't talk anymore She's been on the road most of her life. I just want to find my sister, please. Tell you what - why don't you come down to the station fill out a report, we'll get it all figured out. Thank you Sheriff. Thank you. Come down, let's say uh, tomorrow. We'll get you taken care of. Tomorrow morning. Sheriff, What if she is in trouble? Tomorrow, alright. In the meantime we'll make a few calls and see if I can find her. Look, I"ll call some neighboring departments, I've got friends there okay. Sheriff please, I- Tomorrow morning. You got it? I'm sorry Barney Fife. I didn't realize how busy you were out here in the middle of bumfuck. What did call me cowboy? I said 19 people and 2 cats in this fucking shithole and you can't help me find a missing girl? That's enough. Tomorrow, okay. I'll keep a look out, I promise. Let's go. You can only have one. The effects linger. I see you skulking back there girl. Hello, I'm Christine. I know who you are girl. You're that - stray that Isaac's taken in. Stray. Must you use that stupid thing? It's... it's hard to talk. Amazing. You city girls. Usually just can't shut up. Minister! Who are you anyway? I'm Mrs. Van Den berg. I bring the minister his groceries, medications. You know, make myself useful. Minister! Did I do something to offend you? Oh, what, you just going to stand there gaping? While I put this all away? Don't even offer to help? I can't help it jeez. The second you are in trouble you have no problem freeloading off of somebody else. Abraham! You have no idea who I am. Who the hell do you think- Oh, sorry about her Christine. Mrs. Van Den Berg help is much appreciated, she's a bit old fashioned. It's time for your medication, Minister. Thank you and please, be nicer to Christine, she is our guest. And we are grateful that fate has brought her to us. Of course Minister. I'm, I'm sorry. Did you bring me those candies I like? Yes, but I got the one with peanuts in them because they are a little healthier. Chris. Hello Elijah. Thank God. Bet you wish you stayed up in your room, huh? That woman is just the worst. So it's not just me? Oh, no. She pretty much hates any woman that doesn't have their sweater buttoned up to their adams apple. Well she, would hate this game then. Why's that? Because the Queen is the most powerful piece. Check. Damn. It's a religious thing. Town's all about tradition. What religion is it anyway? I think it started out as Quaker. Like Dutch settler stuff. Oh, so it's Christianity. Not exactly, there's a lot of like... Native rituals like Pagan. Oh, that's not so strange. No? No. The Catholics did it. A Christmas tree is Pagan. You know a lot about religion. My parents were real zealouts. I, was a Catholic school girl for 18 years. Woah, must've been tough. Somedays These followers though. It's weird they convert. You can't judge them. It was hard in those early days. Kids were starving People would do anything to keep their mouths full. Abe once told me. Americans don't know hunger. We only know appetite. Sounds like he's everyone's dad. He can kind of be a pain. He and Isaac seem close. Must be nice. I'm jealous. My parents are gone. You close with your parents? Oh, I'm sorry. No. I haven't seen my mom and dad since I was a kid. Really? I'm sorry. That's terrible. No, no its- You know it's cool. They did some messed up shit. And I got out. That sounds crazy, I'd- I hate that that happened to you. Thank you. I get why you had to leave. I am just lucky that I didn't end up in the psych ward like that hitchhiker. What? The uh, hitchhiker. Didn't she escape the hospital? No I don't think so, where did you hear that? Well, I'm sorry I'll have to out again in a little while. Don't get to clock out when you're in charge. After leading the congregation for so many years that's one thing I have learned the difference between being a grunt and being in charge. When you're in charge, you can't slack off. Mrs. Van Den Berg come by today? She did. I see Christine's still here, so she couldn't of been too awful. No, she was terrible. We're lucky Christine didn't kill her. Christine if you kill Mrs. Van Den Berg I will make you a deputy. She's an annoying old codger and I can say that, because so am I. But she's a woman of great faith. She serves congregation well. Yeah, yeah. Besides if you had met Mr. Van Den Berg before he passed on you'd know why she was so mean. Is Abbie joining us tonight? How's that? Abbie? Abigail, your daughter? How? How did you know about her? We met, this morning. What is she talking about? They met? It's okay, she doesn't know. Does she live with her mom? Christine, Abigail is- She's gone. What? Christine, my um- My daughter went missing. Awhile ago. What are you talking about? It's okay, you didn't know. No. No, that's not possible. We met this morning. Christine. It's the toughest in the morning. Sometimes I forget you know. Maybe a second or two right after I wake up. It's the happiest I am all day. I do shut the door because everytime I look in here I, I expect to see her. Remember Isaac, things happen for a reason. Even if it doesn't make sense right away. I'm sorry. How did you know? I feel like I'm going crazy. What are you doing in here Sheriff? Everything alright? Yeah, it's fine. Let's go, you're driving. Hey, is this Christine? Man, she's way prettier than you said. Really? I hadn't noticed. Okay then. What's she doing asking about Abigail? Don't worry about it. Let's just go. She's fucking hot man. Have some respect. She just had her goddamned jaw wired shut. Mouth full of metal never stopped you from getting a blow- job from what's her name - that skank from the trailer park 37. 38. 39. Coquit wim Christin tui! Why are you doing this to me? Something dark has a hold on you child. But your soul is strong Christine. Your soul can win. But it's shackled to the flesh. Once we break the flesh. Your soul will be free. Chris, please let us fix you. There's nothing to fix! But Christine it's not natural. Can't you see the devil made you this way. You're the only devil here! Be Cleansed! Be reborn. In the waters of saving grace. Stop it please. The water is saving grace. Chris are you okay? Open up. Chris! Oh my God. Are you okay? Come here. What happened? What happened? Here this should help. Thank you. Like I feel so bad I didn't tell you dad sleep walked. He just hasn't done it in awhile so I figured that- I don't think it was your dad. Well, who else would it have been? I don't know it was big, tall. I think that... the shadows, the dark, played tricks on you. I know what I saw. Look, you've been holed up in this house for 2 days. The only thing worse than being cooped up alone is being stuck with my dad. Yeah, maybe you're right. I, I think I'll go to town tomorrow. Yeah, get some fresh air. You know I have a shift in the afternoon, but I can be back in the evening if, uh- you want some company. I, uh, feel bad that you are so spooked out, I- really wanted you to feel at home here. I have, it's... not you. Look, I know it's this backwards small town... weird religion, hell, I don't even own a TV. No wonder we're so strange. What is that? Relax. Wait a sec, no. Let me take care of you. No! What the hell was that? What the fuck is your problem? What are you some kind of fucking tease? Something wrong with me? I'm too much of a hick for a girl like you? What the fuck is it? I'm a gay. What? I'm gay. Fucking dyke. Whoa, hey there Christine. Hey, um, deputy. What's your name again? Isaac said you could use some company going into town. I thought I'd come by, take you for a ride. No, it's okay. C'mon, you're bags already packed. Got an extra jacket in the car just in case. I gotta go. Let me know if you change your mind. Minister, I didn't mean to interrupt. Elijah, come in. Come in. I don't suppose you're here to visit with me are you? No Minister it's not like that. Relax, it's alright if you came to see her. I just want to check on her. Make sure she's recovered. Um, is that all? I'm sure she'll be glad to see you. she's been pretty depressed. Poor thing. I'll try and cheer her up. I admire you Elijah. You're compassion. Well, it's why you're in the inner circle. That's what this congregation needs. Thank you, Minister. I wish Isaac were more like you sometimes. He's, he's a good man sir. He'll be a good leader one day. I used to think so, but uh - he hasn't been the same since... Abigail. Your son is strong. It takes more than strength, it's his compassion... empathy that worries me. He's a bull in a china shop now. Isaac can be, a little pushy sometimes I guess. A little. A lot. Still, you could learn a thing or two from him. Like? Like you can't keep waiting for life to happen to you. Sometimes you just got to go for it. Take what you want. She's upstairs. Last night? Yes. But, but he didn't. No, no, no. I stopped him, but he was just so mad. He was like an animal, he just snapped. I can't imagine. And I feel like I'm being watched. Watched? Look! Look! So? It's just Sam. It's what mailman do. It's the third time he's been down this street. Just today! He's not a very good mailman. And Isaac, he won't let me leave. He has his stormtrooper down here to show me around town and I'm like- it's just so that I won't leave. Christine, I understand Isaac's a jerk but - I think you might be just a little stir crazy. I'm not crazy! No that's not what I mean, I just mean- a little cabin fever that's all. I'm not crazy, I'm not seeing things. Seeing things? What kind of things? I'm having these nightmares. These awful nightmares. And the last one I saw my family. I'm waking up to these sounds- these awful, clawing sounds. Like animals in the walls, like- Clawing sounds. Christine. And I saw Isaac's daughter. Daughter? You saw, Abigail? Un, huh. She, she showed me. This place downstairs. And there is like, another door. And there was chanting. And there was a person in a robe- I think I know what's wrong okay? There's something we should have shown you awhile ago. No. Come here, come here. I know we've told you our religion has some... unusual traditions. In the new world, the founders well, they sort of mixed with local traditions. Formed their own thing. Hold this a second. Don't be fooled by the darkness, it's a- it's a holy place. An old room. Nothing sinister about it. Now that's the ancestors chair. We believe when are minister sits in that chair he has the combined wisdom of all the minsters who led the church before him. If he's worthy that is. It's how we choose who leads our congregation. Congregation? Yeah, it's what we call ourselves. Well, I guess that's kind of nice. Having a whole family to watch over you. Yeah and its, we don't mean it literally. It's not like he hears voices or anything. I think we have been so embarrassed about our religion that we made it this mysterious thing. It's not that weird right? I mean lots of religions honor ancestors, ofrendas or things like that. No. No, no, no. No, it's um, sorry, it's- it's just, it's like the Pope's chair. It's special. So, your full church worships in a basement? No. Not anymore I mean. Back in the old days when Gideon was settled they built this place. We'd be standing under their church right now. Yeah. What happened to the church here? It uh... burned down. There was a fire, it was a long time ago. Oh, ritual gone wrong? Yeah, something like that. And... this? Some kind of altar? Yeah, it's um... we're sort of an offshoot of Christianity. It's not like for sacrifices or anything. C'mon. It gets kinda weird down here in the dark. Anyways I can swing by after my shift to pick you up. Going somewhere? Isaac, hey. Yeah, we're going out later. Elijah, I'll walk you out. What did you tell her? Look, she's scared out of her mind. Okay. Keeping her in the dark now- Why would you take her into that room? Because it's just a room. Now isn't it? It's not some deep dark secret. Who the hell do you think you are? Those aren't your secrets. Why? Because you think when daddy dies we're just going to bow down you? This is why it'll never be you. You have no respect for tradition. Tradition. This isn't a monarchy. We don't follow bloodlines. The chair decides who leads. And you aren't half the man your father was. Was? He's still alive you asshole. Exactly. He's not even cold in his grave and your trying to take his spot. Leaders aren't chosen, they are born. There's something inside them that makes people shut up and listen. No wonder you want Christine so bad. Of course your perfect woman has her mouth sown shut. Don't high road me Elijah. You're a smart guy, but you can't learn what it takes to lead. It takes- It takes what? What does it take Isaac? Balls! Alright? Piss and vinegar and you're soft. Look at the way you coddle her. I'm coddling her because I am nice to her? Not wanting to fuck her? Please. You can't even look at her without breathing through your mouth. Of course she's attractive. But at least I never tried to rape her. Rape? What the hell are you talking about? Yeah, she told me what happened. I didn't try to rape- Isaac, You can't force yourself on her anymore than you can force yourself on our congregation. You know what - fuck you! Get the fuck out of here! Seriously, leave! It sounds primitive at first. But even while accepted religions have this concept Jesus Christ for example, is the most famous Sin Eater. Christians believe he died to take on their sins. And to sanctify God's people. And how is that sacrifice commemorated? By the eating of the Eucharist, the body of Christ and, Christians take that literally. Which is why early persecutors accused them of cannibalism. The Sin Eater rituals varied from faith to faith but, there were alarming common denominators. Sometimes the Sin Eater ritual involved eating a ritual meal of a dead body to consume its sins. In some extreme cases a Sin Eater would consume the body itself, but other times the the consumption was a sort of- inversion. Instead of the Sin Eater it was the sinners who did the eating because once the Sin Eater became defiled by sin. The now pure congregation would paradoxically consume the Sin Eater to erase those sins forever. The earliest Sin Eater rituals required a sacrifice to a demon called Azazel. I'm coming back for her and she's staying with me. Like hell she is. She's scared out of her mind here. She thinks she's seeing things. She thinks she's going crazy. What does it matter anyway? We're running out of time. Look, I'll see you tonight, OK? Christ! Sorry I didn't mean to scare you. What do you got there? Um, it's just Elijah's phone. I was going to run it out to him, but- you were fighting. Yeah, you heard that huh? No, I... I heard a little but- I wasn't listening. Is he gone? Yeah, yeah he's gone. Are, um, you sure you want to go with him? I think it's for the best. Yeah, listen um, I gotta go out on patrol. Please, please don't leave till I get back. I, um... I want to try and make it up to you. Stay for a bit? Oh, um, why don't you give me Elijah's phone I will take it to him while I am out. No that's okay. Yeah, I think it's- I think it's better if I take it. Hey! Going out to look for my sister Sheriff? Jesus! What the hell are you doing here? I know you're not telling me something. This is my home, you come to my home? I will turn this whole town upside down to find Christine! Do you understand me? Look, look calm down. I know you're scared- You listen to me you king shit cop. You may have all these other sheep under your thumb you don't scare me. You better get your Goddamn hands off me! I know you're hiding something and I want to know why? Follow me. A dark force hovers over you. It's grip is strong. Can't you help her Father? We might not be able to save her life, but we may be able to save her eternal life. What does that mean Father? It means... to set her soul free. The flesh may perish. Please let me go. I didn't do anything. Do not listen. The whore of Babylon deals only with lies. May the Holy Spirit purge your sinful desires. Please stop it. Please stop it. If the Holy Water cannot wash away your urges. The Holy Fire be the light to guide you to your salvation. What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Fire reveals all child. It consumes the unworthy. How can you do this to your daughter? But the righteous cannot be burned. Fire reveals the worthy. You're insane. All of you! ELIJAH Chris! Chris! Chris! Jesus Christ what's going on? You killed her. You killed her! She was trying to warn me. I'm not crazy. You killed her. You killed her! Christine wait. Christine wait. Christine. Look, we'll think of something, I'll, I'll- call his deputy okay? No! No he's- What is going on up here!? I can't let you see this. See what? Christine, just calm down. Wait a second okay. No, give me your phone. No, no- We can't do that. I'm sorry sweetheart. Not you too. You're not going anywhere. I'm sorry Chris. It's for the greater good. The greater good. My God- Is it. Is it time Minister? I suppose so. It's always a shame how it turns out being the pretty one. Good work son. Women like you... you have no respect for tradition. You want so badly to speak your single voice. And you call it progress. But the individual is nothing. It's the congregation that endures. And the tradition that binds that congregation. No. Let us pray. Oh great benefactor help us to realize that we all have a role to play. Young, old, men, women. Each with a unique purpose. Mine is to be the voice of truth. And yours. Your purpose is the most important of all. Sorry Christine. I know you killed Abigail you piece of shit. You don't understand. You think I wanted this? I think you're a fucking monster. She saw the ritual. I tried to explain. She's to young to understand. So you killed her to save your own ass. Abbie had to die. So the ritual could endure. Shut up. You think we want to do this? Eat people like fucking savages. If we don't do this- Enough! Don't you see child. We all have our sins. We all have an Abigail hiding in our closet. Elijah's parents. Mrs. Van Den Berg's dearly departed husband. The Sin Eater protects us all. You. Are our salvation. When our ancestors came here. They knew only hunger. They raped and pillaged and made war upon the native peoples. Our original sin. In turn the natives cursed our ancestors. Famine and pestilence brought death upon them. Dutifully our ancestors prayed to God for salvation. And God. Did not come. For God would not forgive us our sins. There was another. The great benefactor. Azazel. Accept our gift and upon our hearth. Leave your blessings. Blood in, blood out. Blood in, blood out. For even God told his chosen people. To sacrifice first - to Azazel. We give easement and rest. Now to thee. Come not down the lanes or in our meadows. And for thy peace we paw our souls. Amen. It's the only way darling. Stop. We love you Christine. Oh God. Protect her from the punishment of the grave. And the torment. Of the fire. No, don't do this. Please. Bless our sins. And make honorable our reception. But our Sin Eater sates our benefactors righteous vengeance. Christine, no! Christine. Father. No!! You sick. No. Thanks to you our Sin Eater. Your flesh shall now become our flesh. Eat of her body. Stop her! She defiles- No, No. Bitch! Fuck! She's escaping. Oh, Father. Father. Oh my God? Father. Elijah! Elijah help him. Me? Do you see what she did to my fucking face? Fuck your fucking face can't you do anything without a doctor holding your hand? What do you want me to do? He's fucking dead. Don't you about him that way. That's my father. Yeah. And the bitch who killed him is getting away right now. Go! Even if you get her back, how will you finish the ceremony? Who will preside? Who will bring the spirit of Azazel upon us- Stop whining. You sound like a little baby. I'm the minister now, so shut your fucking face. You! You think you are going to lead, huh? Open the door. Open the door. Let us out of here. Open the door. Oh No. You ungrateful piece of shit. You have no idea what I've sacrificed for you. All of you! I don't care. We don't owe you anything you entitled little prick. Elijah! Stop. No. It's the second time he's fucked up in a week. And he just thinks we're going to bow down to him. And you think we should bow down to you? We need a real leader not some fucking candy striper. Still think he's fit to sit in that chair? Ever try that again. I will skin you alive. Then line the walls of this house- It's decided by the chair. Chair. The chair will decide. You can't do this. Actually we can. On your knees. Where you belong. You killed my father. But I will be a merciful minister like he was. I'll get out and then I'll come back and kill you. Take it off. Still going to give you the honor. Of being our Sin Eater. I like you Chris. Truly I do. But the Sin Eater is more important. Without you. The bad times come. Disease. Starvation. What's the fate of one. Compared to that of so many. What's the matter? To chicken shit to sit? I pray you're unworthy. When you face your fears You prove your worth. Our ancestors will decide. What's happening. Sheriff? Sheriff! Somebody get an extinguisher now. No. No, don't let her go. Sheriff! What the fuck are we supposed to do now? You. - Me? - Yeah. Yes. Yes that's right. You can lead us. - You get on the chair. - Me, no. Are you fucking kidding me. Did you see what just happened? There is no way I am getting in that chair. No. Get ahold of yourself Did you believe in the chair or didn't you? Well, yeah. Seeing is believing. Shut up you skank. Elijah listen to me. Isaac wasn't meant to lead us. The chair. It knows. You are meant to lead us. You need to take that seat so we can complete the sacrifice. - No. Nope. No way! - Yes. I can't take that chair. Wait, no. No. No fricking way! No, wait. No. Woah. Chris, take it easy. Hey, relax. She doesn't know how to use that thing. Shit. Stay away! You don't have it in you girl. You are a runner, not a fighter. I will kill everyone one of you before I let you eat me. She can't get all of us if we make a rush at her right now. C'mon! C'mon! C'mon. I will take out at least one of you before you get to me. Who's gonna be the hero huh? Christine. Christine. Even if you get out of here. We're just the high council. The whole town is outside waiting for us to finish the ritual.
