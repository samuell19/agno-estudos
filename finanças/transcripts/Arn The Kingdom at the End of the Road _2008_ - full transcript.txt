[ In Arabic ]: You must send in more troops. Sound the retreat! Sound the retreat! Sound the retreat! Sound the retreat! [ In Swedish ]: Cecilia Blanka, I am here to fetch you. Knut Eriksson has taken the throne. I am to take you to the Royal Castle. You are to be Queen. Birger Brosa? Thank you for taking care of my little boy. His name is Magnus, and he's almost a man now. What does he look like? What does he like to do? Does he ride? Yes, he rides. -Does he know? -No. No, I did not wish to saddle him with shame. Cecilia, come here. Cecilia, he'll be back. He'll be back. Cecilia. [ In Swedish ]: The Lord has brought you so that you may forgive me. What am I to forgive, Mother? My sins... My sins against you. I wished to crush the happiness you and Arn Magnusson shared. I tried to punish you because I never had love. You are a good woman, Cecilia. Kind-hearted and forgiving. Your prayers might shorten my time in Purgatory. Can you forgive me? Can you forgive me? Only God can forgive you. I curse you, Cecilia Algotsdotter! I curse you and Arn Magnusson both! ERLAND: [ In Swedish ]: My condolences on the loss of your dear Mother Rikissa. But even in times of sorrow we need to look ahead. The new King's advisor, Brosa, put in a good word for you. I have every reason to trust his judgment. We would like a new, young abbess in our convent, and now we have a vacant position, so to speak. Abbess of Gudhem, how do you like the sound of that? Your own convent? Thank you, your Grace. It is a very fine offer. But I neither can nor wish to take any vows. No? My time of penance is almost over. I have had my punishment. At the next full moon, I will leave Gudhem Abbey and go to the Queen, to await my betrothed at the castle. Tell Brosa that. [ In Arabic ]: Master, the Knights Templar will break camp at dawn. They have gathered a great army south of the Horns of Hattin. SALADlN: They plan to meet us in the desert. Fools. They are doomed to perish. After a great defeat comes a great victory. BROSA [ In Swedish ]: You're not bringing much with you back into the world, Cecilia Algotsdotter. The King and Queen await you at the Royal Castle. And I've sent Magnus there, as well. So, now he knows? Yes, now he knows. BROSA: I heard you declined the Bishop's offer. I understand if you need time. I've had all the time I need. Blanka! I'm so pleased to see you! It's good to meet you at last, Cecilia. King Knut. -This is for you. -Thank you. Magnus. Mother? Magnus, don't just stand out here in the rain. You must have wondered. Your father... Your father and l... I know. You don't have to... Brosa says he's dead. Brosa knows nothing. He's alive. He's alive in my prayers. In mine, too. [ In Arabic ]: The defeated salutes you, victorious King. Greetings, my most worthy opponent. Take a seat. [ In Swedish ]: My name is Ebbe Sunesson. I bring tidings of friendship from the Sverker clan. Mark my words: we must act before the Sverker clan does. It's just a matter of time before they lay claim to the throne. Let them come. We're not strong enough right now. Pray tell, who is the Queen's friend? I am Cecilia Algotsdotter. She's been a lay sister at Gudhem Abbey. A nun? She doesn't look like a nun. That's my mother you're talking about. Is that so, boy? And where is your father? He's a Knight Templar in the Holy Land. Then you have my condolences. What do you mean? Jerusalem has fallen. The Knights Templar were slaughtered like dogs. All of them. Every last one. You lie! I may sin from time to time, but I never lie. If you can defeat me, you may call me what you like. Magnus. Magnus, calm down. BROSA: Let's be sensible. Our families have fought for generations. We have all lost kinsmen. I don't think any of us wants more bloodshed. No, but we would like you to reconcile with the Sverker clan. If you expect me to turn over the crown, you are sorely mistaken. If Sverker Karlsson wanted the crown, he would have taken it away from you long ago. No! Is the King unwell? Well, he'd be in better shape with less beer in him. This is best for everyone. BLANKA: Don't go back to the convent. We will always be friends, even if I wear a habit and a cross. But I can't stay. I must devote my life to something. The convent is the only life I know. Welcome back. Cecilia. Is it...? It is you! It is you! Mother. Have we changed so much? Our souls are unchanged. You are the Cecilia I remember. MAN: Riders approaching! [ In Swedish ]: So, we meet again. The famous Knight Templar! Or are you a farmer? What a sweet home you've built for you and your pretty wife. I suggest you deliver any message you may have immediately, without dismounting. Watch over her. The woods round here are not as safe as they were. Especially now as your King Knut lies on his deathbed. He won't be able to hold the throne much longer. How much time does he have? I'm not sure, but he's passing blood in his stool, and that's never a good sign. The Sverkers have made Ebbe Sunesson their commander. And he has the Danish King behind him, as well as the Danish army. We aren't ready to meet the Danes in battle. There's only one solution. What did you say? I said there is only one solution. ARN: One, two, three. Good! Five, six. One, two... ARN, VOlCE-OVER: I have seen so much evil. So much death. I prayed to God never to see war again. But if the Sverker King draws his sword, war will be upon us. CEClLlA: I'm here, too. I will be with you every second of the way. -God has a plan for you. -To go to war? To make peace. ARN: Sverker has declared war. His forces will soon be here. It will take more than courage to defeat them. But I swear to you, we will be ready. God be with you, Magnus. I know you will return. Everything's ready. I don't know. Our men are fearful. Listen to me! Cast aside all doubt. Believe! Believe in our victory. We chose this place. Not the Danes and not the Sverkers. We chose this time. Not the Danes and not the Sverkers. Believe. God stands by those who are strong in faith. That is why we shall win and peace shall reign. Horsemen! Forward! They're trying to scare us! Prepare! Charge. Ready! Wait... Now! It's a trap! Now! Prepare again! Charge! Charge! Now! Charge! For Norway! Now ride off! I will never leave you again. You're hurt?! Arn? Arn! The Virgin Mother never abandoned us. I love you. I love you.
