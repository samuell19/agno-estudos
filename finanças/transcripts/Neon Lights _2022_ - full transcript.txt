(suspenseful music) (Clay breathing heavily) (Clay laughing) (dramatic intro music) (piano) - What are you thinking about? - The interview. - What about it? - I'm nervous. - What about it makes you nervous? I won't be able to prove that I can run Tempest and I'll lose my company. - What do we do when we're getting to that uncontrollable state? (heavy breathing in and out) Very good. What is the worst that can happen? - I've been calling you. - I didn't hear. (Clay snickering) - I call you answer. That's how this works. - I can handle this. - Great. So we're not going to fuck this up then are we? - I have it under control. - Hey, again, I just wanted to pop in and say hi before we get started. (Clay snickering) Okay, all righty, um, looking forward to it and see you out there. - She's going to be trouble. (heavy breathing) Tense is never good. Never good. Smile. Act natural. Don't bring up the offer price, and if she brings it up, just tell her it's still being finalized. You can talk about India, just no specifics. Clayton, don't fuck this up. They're watching. You know, you're my favorite. You know that, always and forever. (dramatic music) - Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Tech Weekly. I'm your host Anna Reid. Here with us today is Clay Amani, the brilliant mind and visionary behind Tempest Tech. Thanks for coming in today, Clay. So Tempest has had the fastest growth in the last 18 months. You must be proud? - Yes, it's very exciting. We work very hard and we're very close to achieving our goals. - There seems to be a trend with young tech entrepreneurs of promising the Moon and pushing for aggressive growth in a short span with minimal to show for it. Is that the case with Tempest? - We've been able to manage our growth conservatively. Yet effectively. - What sets you apart? (Clay snickering) - Well, our expansions have been more timely, and we've been able to manage our hires and our facilities to meet our requirements and product output rather... - Rather than showcase nominal value. - No, no, no. Not nominal, actual value with correct figures to back the growth. - Speaking of growth, there has been a ton of speculation surrounding Tempest's expansion and specifically, what are your strategic plans for expanding into India? - We feel our expansion into India will provide opportunities for us to grow while still allowing Tempest to bring better health care systems to parts of the world that, obviously need it. - Well, obviously it's also a cost effective investment. Now would you say, the lower offer price is a way to entice investors to overlook a depressed last quarter. - No, no, no, not depressed, not depressed at all. Prices would decrease to garner attention from investors willing to take a bet on Tempest, long term. We're excited about our technologies, product and growth. - Prices weren't increased, though, correct? How about this, sources, say that, Tempest's management is undergoing massive change, specifically that your board is looking to replace you as acting CEO. Is there any truth to that? We can skip to the next question, if you'd like. Okay. Let's go back to... - No more questions. Shut that off. (dramatic music) - Are you okay? Was I too much? I'm just, it's my job. - You're trying to ruin me. - I'm not trying to do anything. - You're trying to make me look inept. You, succeeded. - Clay. May I? You're talented. Everyone recognizes that. That brain of yours is, incredible. It's extraordinary. Building software and technology. What you went through was tragic. But eventually, you'll set yourself free otherwise. (dramatic music) Good luck with everything, Clay. (dramatic music) (clapping in background) - Oh you sure handled that. That was the one time you had to do it alone, Clayton. That was the one time that you needed to prove that you could handle the stresses that come with being a CEO of your own company. That you can handle the tough questions, the scrutiny, that you could handle your destiny and you failed. You failed. You'll always need me. - No, I don't. - Round and round and round, you go, into the shadows, Clayton must go. Round and round and round you go. (suspenseful music) - I can't do it. - You don't need that here, Clay. Thank you. What can't you do? - Run, Tempest. I can't run Tempest. - Just stay with me just for a moment, Clay. (Clay laughing) Clay. Sit down, please. Please Clay, sit down. Thank you. Now. Do you need to run Tempest to be happy with what you've created? - Tempest is all I have left. It's all that's been keeping me going. - Are you having dark thoughts, Clay? - No. - We can't move forward and deal with our present issues until we deal with our past. I think it's time we deal with the traumas we talked about what needed to happen eventually. And now it's time. It is time you reconnect with them. You must and you will. Okay. Okay. Okay. Good. Now just close your eyes. Allow yourself to relax. (suspenseful music) - Clay Amani of Tempest Tech has gone off the grid with little explanation. And so close to IPO, the company stands on the verge of collapsing. His ability to operate and lead has come into question for quite some time now. How will Tempest recover? Who will replace the once revolutionary health care tech genius? - Hello Anna, it's been a really long time, and I just thought, I would call, because, because I thought maybe I could take the family back to India. (dramatic music) - Well, well, if it ain't the tech genius himself. - James. James. - We see you got your stut, stutter when you're nervous, huh. Still like physical contact too right. Damn, you did good bro. - Yeah. - You did real good. - Hi, thanks for having us, Clay. This place is beautiful. Blair baby, come say hi to your, uncle. - Hi. It's uh, nice to see you again. - Again, when did you see him? - Oh, honey, he's a famous tech guy on TV. - Yeah. - Oh, right, right. All right, well, this is all, peachy. Can we go inside? - Yes, yes. Why don't I show you to rooms and get you settled? - Um-hmm! James, come and grab our shit. - No, no, no, that's okay. The housekeepers will be able to bring you bags up to your rooms for you. - Housekeepers. That's uh, that's what I wanted, I like that, I like that a lot. You got uh, you got to have a few of those. - James, you're so annoying, let's go Blair. - You good? (suspenseful music) - This, this is the living room? - Yeah, no shit. - This place looks old. - It is, it was built in the 20s. - Furniture's from the 20s too? (Clay snickering) - Some, yes. - Antiques. - That's right. - Yeah, you got any booze? - Yes. - Really. So soon. - Here's the bar, it's full, so please help yourself. - Antique bar to go with antique furniture and an antique house, it's amazing. - No don't. There's a bottle opener in the drawer James? - There's no need bro, I'm simple. - Whoops! - No, no, no. - Guys. - Please be careful because this rug... - It's antique. - Yes. That's the kitchen. - Let me guess, let me guess, umm, personal chef. - No, but there's lots of food and you can help yourself. - Thank you. - You have housekeepers, but no chef. Okay, I got to teach you how to run a mother fuckin mansion. - James. Shut up man. - What? We're bonding. - Uh. I'll, I'll show you to your rooms. (suspenseful music) This is your room. - Check out the lighting. It's just like the club, huh. - This one's yours, James. - Money for the money, man. Well I dig it. - Hmm. - Yeah, we'll work on that. Yeah, when did the housekeepers bring this up? I didn't see no one. Stealth employees, I like it. - No, no, no, no, no shoes on the bed. Take them off bro. - Just chill. Oh, this feels good. - This one's yours. - Wow. Oh, this is beautiful. - This isn't yours. - Don't worry kid, won't make too much noise, all right. - No, please. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. My house, my rules, everybody gets their own rooms. - Hey, that's, that's cool, that's cool, right? - Yeah, sure. - Dinner will be at 5:00 p.m. Please don't be late. - What's upstairs? - It's off limits. (snickering) - What else is off limits, hotshot? - Housekeepers live on the estate and they prefer their privacy. (snickering) Okay. We'll see you at dinner. Please don't be late. 5:00 p.m. (snickering) - Why? My house, my rules, Benny. (snickering) (suspenseful music) - How joyful. Family reunions Clayton, are always just joyful. Clarissa's still very easy to look at, isn't she? We're still fond of your brother's wife, aren't we? Nothing like a little incestuous reunion. Just spice things up. I want it noted that I don't think this is going to pan out exactly the way you think it's going to happen. - Noted. - Very well then sire, you're in control now. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (banging on window) - Hello. Sorry, hope I didn't scare you. What have you got there? Oh, it's a magpie. One means sorrow. It's a superstition. May, may I? Here little guy, here little guy it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. (bones cracking) You need to set him free. (upbeat music) ♪ You made me you trust me ♪ ♪ It's all over the country ♪ ♪ Of taking matters to join me ♪ ♪ I'm having none of that dispel me ♪ (loud sniffing) - You're the fuckin wolf. Yeah that's right baby you're the motherfucking wolf. You're going to get what's yours. Tonight. So are you. (loud sniffing) (upbeat music) - What are you doing? - We're going to take a shower, but it's taken. - Dinner's almost ready, James. - Yeah, I'll be right there. (suspenseful music) - I think I got a business proposition for you. - Yeah. - Yeah, I think it's time that you diversify a bit. Maybe we become partners. - In what? - The club, obviously. - Oh obviously. (Blair laughing) - Look, man, I'm serious, I'm looking to expand, and I know you do a little bit of this and a little bit of that. - Wow, Clay, this looks absolutely amazing. Oh. - Who made all this? - My chef. - I thought you said you didn't actually, actually let me guess, umm. You hired one because I'm a genius. See, we make great partners. James, I honestly think you get dumber by the minute, dude. - Mm-Hmm. Mm-Hmm. (laughing) - So we good. - Mm-Hmm. Yes. - I'm starved. Lets have a leg. - Wait, wait, could you start with the salad. Salad first. - Okay. Yeah, okay.. - Yeah, I don't eat salad. - You can use some veggies, bro. - What does that even mean, man? - Just please shut up, man. All right. - Here you go. - I'm just saying. - You got it. - Well, there's a carrot. - Why did you stop eating meat? - I never liked meat Benny. - What are you talking about? We ate meat our whole lives. - We were forced to eat meat our whole lives, James But I didn't like it. - Why didn't you just say something? (classical music) - Well you've, you've done good for yourself, Clay. I never really thought you'd make it. Never mind, never mind all this. - Rags to riches like, literally. Speaking of which, back to my proposition about the clubs. - James, shut the fuck up about your business ventures, man. No one's going to invest in a, in a chunky club rat. - Fuck you, man. I'm a legitimate businessman. (all laughing) I am. - Hm-Mmm. - Fuck all you guys. - What I was getting at what I was getting at is this kid couldn't keep himself from wetting his own bed. Now he's the owner of a, of a giant company. (classical music) - So I hear you might lose your job in your own company. How does that work? - Can I please go to my room? - Yes. - No. - Benny. - I said no. Honey finish your food. - Okay. - Is that true? - Losing your marbles, bro? Whatever's left of them. - Please um, I don't want to talk about work. Why, why don't we have dessert? - Mommy, I don't really feel like dessert. - Yes. Yes, you do, honey. - Dad. - She doesn't have to have dessert. - What did you say? - I'm sorry. - She's not your daughter, Clay. Honey, why don't you have some of the cake, you're incredible, super smart, super giving uncle made for you, okay. - Okay. - Why are we here bro? We don't see you for what ten years maybe? James, you've seen him. James hasn't seen you. I haven't seen you. They haven't seen you. Not a call. Not a visit. Not even help bailing me out when I needed it the most. So why are we here Clay? Why now? (banging on table) Am I too dumb for you, Clay? Hm-mmh. - No. - Not worth responding. - I just want to spend some time together. Have, be a family, you know, like, you know, move past all of this. - Move pass what exactly? The fact that you abandoned us. - I didn't. - You think I forgot that you abandoned us Clay. Is it fucking with your, with your techie zen bullshit, is that it, bro, hmm? Or maybe, just maybe you're going a little, you know? Cuckoo, cuckoo. A little cuckoo, hmm. Please, please. - I'm sorry. Thank you for a lovely evening. Goodnight. - Can I please be excused? - Yes. Yes, of course, baby. (James laughing) - So we're doing shots? - Yes. (suspenseful music) - inhale, exhale. Where are we Clay? Breathe, where are we? - Round, round and round and round you go. Round and round and round and round. You will always need me Clay you will always live in other people's shadows. You need to deal with your problems like a man. Your company is plummeting. And yes, always you are incapable of doing anything about it. And I'll step in to save the day and I will. Because you're my favourite. Always, my favourite. I am a man. (snickering) and I don't need your help anymore. - Whose help don't you need anymore Clay? (snickering) - I'm doing the best I can. - Well, your best is as always, nowhere near good enough. - What's happening Clay? (screaming) - I'm telling you, I'm telling you. - I know. - This kid's losing his shit. - No. Any day now. (Benny clicks his tongue) - Hopefully we're in his will. - Okay, really, really. Is James thinking about others? - I better be in that will. I didn't come up here for nothing. (Benny belching) - Aah. I'm going to go take a piss. If I can find a bathroom in this shithole. - Hurry back. - No problem. - Thank you. Aah. - So how have you been? -Really. - Come on. It'll be fun. Just one. - Just once. Oh, well, you feel me on top of you. You want to feel my tongue? - Yeah. - Are you my wolf? - Oh yeah. - Are you my big, bad fucking wolf? - Yeah, baby. - Oh, you want to howl for me? - Yeah. - How bad? - Really bad. - Keep dreaming. Get the fuck away from me. Well, I think I've had enough for tonight. I'm a... I'm going to head upstairs. Would you like to join me? - Mm-hmm. - Goodnight James. - What? - I didn't say anything. (suspenseful music) (crickets chirping) - Fuck. Fucking bullshit. - There's something weird about all this shit. - He's always been odd, okay. You of all people know this. Yeah, but not like this. Never like this. - He probably has cancer or something. - I don't know, I'm just getting a bad vibe somehow. I just don't know why we're here. - Hey, babe. Hey. Fuck. - You haven't seen him in a long time. He's always been good to us though. - Yeah, yeah. The little creep has always been good to you. He's never been good to us. - Hello. - He's acted like, like I never existed, the minute he left for college. - Benny you never made it easy for him. - What is that supposed to mean? - You know what it means? He was your literal punching bag. - He had it easy. Not me. And not, James. We took the beatings every time he fucked up. We got licked, fucking literally, always, so that Clay could learn a lesson. And why, hmm? Why, what did he have that we didn't? That I deserved... - Okay. - Baby you're so, so special. You're my favourite. (dramatic music) - Housekeepers? No, no, I'm coming. Fuck me. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (melodious music) - Good morning. - Oh, good morning. You're up early. (melodious music) - Is that true what Benny said last night? - About what? - Are you going crazy? - Oh, no. I don't think so. (Clay and Blair laughing) - Are you sick? - No. Well. Maybe. Just joking. - Oh, good joke. - Do you read a lot? - Yeah, I find it soothing. - You and I both. - Astrology, - Sorry. - It's on astrology. - Hm-mmh! - Our birthdays give us our meaning to life. Sometimes our purpose in life too. - So what's the meaning to your life? - Well, I'm born April 7th, which makes me an Aries. So that means uh. (Blair laughing) I don't actually believe in this shit, I just find it interesting. (Clay and Blair laughing) - You're funny. - Do you know what the meaning to your life is? (dramatic music) Are you at least happy with your life? - I, don't know. (snickering) - Me neither. - What would you change? - Love. - Love. - I wish I had parents that loved me. - They do. - They're not parents. Parents protect their kids. Or actually take care of them. Take them to after school programs, events. And teach them things. Mine are just adult kids. - What are you two nerds, doing? - Good morning. Hey, have you guys, have you guys seen James? - Ah knowing Jay he's probably passed out under a tree? - I mean, you're probably right. Hey, Clay, do you have rackets? - I ain't playing tennis. - Yes, you are. - Uh-uh. - Yes, you are. - No. - Come on, please, please, please, please. Blair baby, we're playing tennis. I am. - Okay. - And please keep it that way. - Yeah you too. You're dead anyway. - Aren't you, uh cold? - No. (Blair snickers) What were you guys talking about? - Who? - You and Clay. - Oh, books. (Blair laughing) - Ah. You guys got that in common, huh? - Yeah, I guess. - Do you have any book recommendations for me? (Blair laughing) - What? - No. - You know, your dad can read, right? - I don't have any recommendations. - I'm just saying we can, maybe we can do uh, you know, like a, like a dad daughter, like a, like a father daughter, kind of, you know, like a mutual hobby kind of thing. (Blair snickering) Yeah, that's not really my thing, huh. - Come on. (suspenseful music) - Hello. James, I swear to God, if you were just. Clay you scared, the shit out of me. - I'm, I'm sorry. Oh, I got this one for you. - Thank you. - What? - We really missed you. - I missed you guys a lot, and I should've been there. I just I can't, I can't. - Clay, It's okay. Just forget it. Don't worry. - You got to warm up first, okay. - Okay. - There you go. Yeah. Get those knees up, up, up. Get your cardio up hon. You know, I used to play a little. - Oh, okay. - I was really good. Ready. Watch out it's going to be fast. (Benny whooping) That was good, right? - Dad, dad, dad, are you okay? - Aah. - Sorry, sorry. - Don't yell. I'm fine. - I won't do that again. - Shall we start? - What, what are the teams? - You're on my team. - Where do I go, here? - Yeah. - Oh. - Here you go. - Oh, hehehe. Yes. - See. - Sorry. My ball. - Okay. - Nice and low, nice and low. - Okay. - Um, shhh. Sorry. - Bend your knees. It's okay. There you go. - Aah. - Hehehe, yes. - It's two for them. - Sorry, sorry. - There you go. Yes. - A winner, yes. - Fuck you, that was in. - Benny, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. - That was in. - Benny. Come on. - Dude, that was in. - Benny. Really? - You're a cheating a little scrawny, fuck, you know that. - Benny, come on. - No, fuck this. - Benny. No, no, no. Benny stop. - Stay the fuck away from my girl, you creep. You didn't think I knew you were seeing her when I was on the inside. - Benny. Huh? - Don't. (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What to do, what to do what to do? I was only playing, I just, I was just trying to play tennis. I was just trying to play tennis. I'm sorry. (suspenseful music) (tennis racket smashing) (suspenseful music) (soft piano music) (stairs creaking) (soft piano music) - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Round and round and round you go. Beyond the shadows you must go. Round and round and round and round. - What is this? (voices tormenting Clay) - Tell me what's happening. - Please just stop it, stop, stop. - Clay, just breathe. - Stop it. - Where are we Clay? - Why does he always hurt me? - Who's hurting you? - It was my brother. - Why does he hate me? - You need to let him go, Clay. You need to set him free. - When will we stop this Clay? ( whimpering) (suspenseful music) You can't be fixed. You shake, you, you tremble you can't be fixed. You, you left me alone. - No. - You ran away. You abandoned the family Clayton. - She can't help you, but I can. - Could you? - Please. Please what, please what? You're so weak, so pathetic. - It's okay Clay, Clay I got you. Just breathe. Tell me what's happening. Clay, stay right here. - Rough day. - And who are you supposed to be? - Denver Kane. - And when did you get here Mr. Kane? - Denver please. - Right. - May I? - Please. (glasses clinking) - It's such a weak man's characteristic to actually strike a woman, such a beautiful way to mock you. - And you're, you're what, you're a strongman. (fingers tapping on table) - A truly strong man. Who knows exactly what to do with his hands for a woman. - Is that right? - Yes. - Hmm! How so? - Depends. It really does, depend. - And it depends on what? (suspenseful music) Oh, yes. (suspenseful music) (Clarissa laughing) (door slamming) What the heck? (clicking) - Round and round and round and round and round and round and round round and round, round. - James. (door creaking) (suspenseful music) (door shutting) (suspenseful music) - Round and round and round and round and round. - James. (crickets chirping) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) - Really, he's doing much better. - Oh, that's good news. - However, the damage to the frontal lobe, that's going to be challenging. - Okay. You've said he's doing better though, correct? - Well, we won't know the full extent of his mental state until he's recovered from the current state that he's in right now. His motor controls are completely diminished, except for some sensory feelings. - So when can I take him home? - We'll have to take that day by day as the court ordered. He's still a threat to his own life and perhaps those around him, - He can't move, how can he be violent? - I know this is difficult for you, sweetheart, but until I can assess his mental state, I cannot advise that he'd be released. Okay, please understand. Now your visits are very good for him and I'd recommend you continue to see him as much as possible, okay. - Of course. - Okay. Hey, baby. We need to get you a haircut. (Clarissa laughing) Maybe also a beard trim. You are looking rather distinguished. Sorry Blair couldn't be here. She is on her way to her future mother in laws. For a wedding outfitting. So strange that she's getting married so soon. (melancholy music) Can you hear me? Please, please, just say something baby. (melancholy music) - Sorry, to interrupt ma'am. - Oh. I got to get going anyway. (suspenseful music) - I wonder what's going through that head of yours? Honestly, I can't imagine what it'd be like to be trapped in my own mind. Not being able to move or control anything in my life. Do I bother you, Mr. Amani? (water splashing) You don't like me washing your balls and your armpits? Maybe too much. Fuck you. I mean, do you think I want to fucking be here. I mean, you, it's your own fault that you're here. You're weak. You know what? Immobile patients drown, all the time. Accidents happen, right? And come, come to think of it, you were in an accident, right, Clay? That's how you ended up adopted. That brain of yours is incredible. It's extraordinary even. Building software technology. But now, round and round, you go into the shadows, you will go. (nurse laughing) Hey, hey. It's okay, it's okay. It'll be quick. I know, I know, you don't want to go, I know. It's time for you to go. I'm going to set you free. (suspenseful music) What did you do? What did you do? What did you do? (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) - Clay. Where is everyone? (suspenseful music) - What'd you do, what'd you do, what did you do? Clarissa. (suspenseful music) Oh my. (suspenseful music) - Oh. (breathing heavily) (laughing and snickering) - What the hell happened? - I found the tequila bottle out there. - I saw James. I fucking saw James. First, there was a shed and it was purple and... Oh my God, oh my God. James is dead. James is fucking dead. (woodpecker tapping) Where, where's, where's Benny and where's Blair and, and, and where we're at? I don't know. I don't know, I just I... - Stop, stop, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine. I just saw them. - No. - I just saw them. - No. James's body is in a purple shed. I. I. (suspenseful music) - Clarissa listen, stay with me, breathe okay. Look at me, look at me, look at me. You're going to be okay. I'll take care of you. I believe you. We just need to get back home and sort things out. And make things right, okay. (Clay snickering) (Clarissa laughing) (blood dripping) (Clay snickering) (suspenseful music) - Round and round and round, you go into the shadows you must go. Round and round, round and round into the shadows you go. Hello, Benny. - Fuck. Fuck you. - It's time, Benny. I know, I know, I know, I know you don't want to go, but it's time. - I can't take it. - You need to set him free. You're scared, you're scared, you're sorry. For what were you scared of sorry? - I'm sorry. - Are you sorry? Are you sorry? - I'm sorry. - Are you scared? I said, I'm sorry. - Say it louder. - I'm sorry. - You lie. - I'm sorry. - Lies. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. (Benny screaming) - You will be shot. (voice mumbling) - I didn't do anything, I, I made mistakes. I made mistakes. I, I tried really. - Goodbye Benny. - No. (Benny screaming) (melancholy music) Goodbye. (crickets chirping) - Hey, baby. You okay? - Benny's gone. - Wait, what do you mean, gone? Blair. What is she talking about Clay? What is she talking about? - They're gone. - What did you say? - They're gone. - I need you to speak up. And I need you to be a fucking man. - I am a man. (snickering) No, I am a man. Clarissa. - Blair. Benny. Benny. Ben, where did... Where are they? Where are they Clay? - Stop. Stop it. I won't ever hurt you again. We can finally be together, we can be a family. (snickering) - You won't hurt me? - Mom. - Baby it's okay, it's okay. Don't be scared, okay, everything's, everything's fine. (Clay laughing) - I've been good to everyone. Haven't I? - Yes. - Haven't I? - Yes. Yes. (clock ticking) (Clay exhaling) (clock ticking) Dinner will be ready soon. You should both get cleaned up. You're filthy. Oh it's your favourite dishes. I'm so excited. (snickering) Oh, and, please don't be late. (snickering) (clock ticking) (door closing) (clock ticking) (suspenseful music) - I've been calling. I call you answer. That's how this works. What do you think you're doing, Clayton playing house? While, I take out the trash. Need I remind you? That I raised you, I raised you. I made you, and you were my favourite. You had such promise. Then you ran away. You ran away. You ripped us apart. You are spitting on my sacrifices and continue to do so. I want you to come back to what is important, us, and our company. You need to come back to me. To me, boy, boy, boy. It ends tonight? (suspenseful music) No Denver, please. Please Denver. Denver. (Clay hearing voices) (Clay hearing voices) (suspenseful music) (Clay screaming) (suspenseful music) (Clay screaming) (suspenseful music) (classical music) - Would you like some salad Clay? - Yes, darling, I would. Oh let me help you. Can you get that? Thank you. (classical music) - Thank you. - Of course. - It's the outside fork. (snickering) I was thinking you should take up coding, sweetheart. I'm talking to you. - Like computer coding. - Mm-hmm. - I'm not really into that. - You'll learn to be into it, like me. We'll start a company together someday. (classical music) (suspenseful music) Why aren't you eating? I asked a question. I ask and you answer, that's how this works. (snickering) - What is this? What are we doing Clay? And why are we dressed like this? (suspenseful music) - I'm trying to have a nice family dinner. (slamming fist on table) I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I just really, will you stop. - We're going. Blair, baby, get up. We're going. (Blair sniveling) - Sit right there and don't move. - Blair Baby, get up. We're going home. (Blair sniveling) - Can you please come back to the table? We're having a dinner. - Get up, baby. - No. Please sit down. Sit down. You're ruining dinner. (snickering) (Blair sniveling) Eat your food. - I can't. - Baby let's go, let's go. - Why are you being so ungrateful after everything I've done for you, you are spitting on my sacrifices. - Where's James, Clay and where's Benny? (fork tapping on plate) Stop, asking for him. I've done everything for you, haven't I? I've been good to you, haven't I? (Blair crying) - Please. - Do you want to know? - Please, Clay where is Benny? - He's gone. (Clarissa crying) Gone. (snickering) I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. (Clarissa crying) I'm trying to protect you. Trying to protect both of you. (Blair crying) - No, get away from me, get away from me. - Don't say that, don't say that. (Clarissa crying) (thunder rumbling lightning crashing) - Are you ready to face the traumas? (inhaling heavily) - Yes. - Good. Why don't you start with the earliest memory of your father? (suspenseful music) - Okay. My father's name was Denver Kane. (snickering) He took me in at the age of four. - Okay. It's okay, stay with me, Clay, stay with me, what else? - No. - Clay. - No. I should've been there I could have protected them I, I could have saved them. - You need to get rid of the guilt and the fears. You need to let them go, Clay. (suspenseful music) (thunder rumbling lightning crashing) (Clay hearing voices) (Denver tormenting Clay) - You need to kill off the guilt. (voices tormenting Clay) - I should have been there. I should have been there. I should have been there. I could have saved them. - End this. (thunder rumbling lightning crashing) - What did you do Clay? - What did you do, what did you do, Clay? - This must end tonight, Clay. They must all be gone. - No. - She must go. They all must go. - No. You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. It's OK, come out. - You just, kill me, kill me, kill me. - No. (Blair crying) (suspenseful music) Didn't mean to hurt you. (thunder rumbling lightning crashing) (Blair gasping) Please. It's okay, come out. Blair. (suspenseful music) - This is all your fault. - I'm sorry. - Blair. - It's too late, Clay. You couldn't save us. You can save her. - I'm sorry. - You were his favourite. He did this for you, for you, for you, for you. (suspenseful music) - Blair, I'll protect you now. - Stay away from me. Stay away from me. (suspenseful music) - Blair. Blair. (Blair screaming) Blair. Blair. (Blair screeching) - Help! Help! Help! - Ahh! (somber music) (crying) - It all ends tonight. (crying) (somber music) - No, no, no. You just stay with me, stay with me, stay with me. Stay with me, stay with me. Oh my god, oh my God, oh my God. No, no. Oh God. (crying in anguish) (somber music) I'm sorry. I should have protected you. I should have protected you. - Round and round and round you go. Into the shadows, Clay must go. I did this for us, Clay. - It needs to end tonight, Clay. You must move past all the guilt. You must kill all of the trauma. You must finish this. - You've always been my favourite. I did this, so you would come back to me and I could keep you to myself. Keep you all to myself forever. (suspenseful music) I've always been good to you, Clayton, haven't I? I've always been good to you, haven't I? (suspenseful music) It must end tonight, Clay. You must set yourself free. - I forgive you father. - My favourite. - Always and forever. (inhaling and exhaling deeply) (axe smashing) (Clay mumbling) (gasping for breath) (suspenseful music) (breathing heavily) (laughing cynically) (suspenseful music) Sorry. (crying in anguish) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) - Where are we right now, Clay? Clay, where are we right now? - It's done. - What's done? - I set them free. I set myself free. (crying) - How do you feel about that? (snickering) - The best that I can. - Good. I am so proud of you Clay. You had a breakthrough here today. You dealt with a lot. You were able to kill off a lot of the pain and the agony. You were able to kill off the guilts. You faced the ones you loved and the ones who lost. This will help you find the peace within you. - Thank you. - Be kind to yourself for these next few days. Take things slow. (suspenseful music) (sniffling) (snickering) - I'll see you next week. - If you need to you know where to find me. (door shutting) (suspenseful music) - Hey. (nurse laughing) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (paper tearing) (suspenseful music) - Sir. - To the office, please. - Very well, sir. (suspenseful music)
