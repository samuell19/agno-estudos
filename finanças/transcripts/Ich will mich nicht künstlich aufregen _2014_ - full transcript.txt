Shit, shit, shit! ASTA UPSET Originally standards would have derived from consumers' desires. It's why they're accepted without resistance. It omits to say that the basis from which technology controls society represents the power of the economically strong in society. Cars, bombs and films unite things for as long as their levelling element shows its strength in the wrongdoing it furthered. 28 January 1941. You can eliminate formalist critique only by applying intelligent and easy criteria for the social impact of art. Tradition seems to just mean obligations. Not just qualitatively, but specifically for certain qualities. Meaning aesthetic qualities become fixed categories. Realism as a literary genre in the sense of Balzac or Tolstoy is of course a historic phenomenon, rather than realism per se. Applying social criteria you may define realism only in terms of the writer's approach to reality... and the reality of writing, which includes how he communicates with the reader. For instance, a realistic novel cannot be achieved just by writing in the manner of Balzac or Tolstoy, or just anyone using their style. Instead, a sense of reality must be evident. So that writing hands out reality to the reader. So you've got to probably write differently in the year 1940 to the year 1830. This is a generalisation. But it's the terrain on which the battle takes place. - The bill please. Together or separately? - Together. - That'll be 36 Euro. - Thanks, that'll be alright. Last night, I watched "Eight Hours Don't Make a Day". In the penultimate sequence Hanna Schygulla sits like I do. The others surround her, just like you do. Then she explains how adding value works. Her friend Jochen works as toolmaker in a factory. Free to organise work themselves his group worked twice as fast. They may keep half of the profit gained from their extra effort. Just as I start feeling glad for them their boss decides to shift their work into a new hall at the other end of town. They all have to move. So Hanna Schygulla asks everyone, what's he buy the new hall from? As they don't get it, she gives the answer herself. It's the money he makes off your work! He buys it with money the workers have made him. Then it's his, to use as he wishes. And the workers don't benefit. The inevitability she doesn't approve of. And she bluntly says so. On West German TV. At prime time. The ratings are huge. Then the series is cancelled. Production stops. It simply ceases. But how can we talk about something non-existent? Enter. Just a minute, I just have to... Full stop. Hello, what is it? Ah... I didn't manage to look at it yet. So why don't you tell me? You know we get two thirds funding from outside. An Italian sweets manufacturer pledged unconditional support. In truth they see art production as viral marketing. - Which the artists rejected. - Precisely. - And? - That's it, finished. - Pity. - Isn't it? Is it possible that your artists... recognising they're showcasing neo-individual-liberalism needed to reassure their own criticality? Want some coffee, tea? No? Principally, they had no interest in the image... ...of a coffee machine... - Sorry. - ...in enhancing it. Look, isn't it obvious by now that Artist Critique in capitalism post 1968... has got utterly, and I mean utterly... appropriated, incorporated... and trans-coded into cultural life-style capital. Hipness adieu! Welcome to the Berliner Republic, guys! It's all about affirmation, or keeping to the original. Either excel, or your ball is out! Unfree leisure time increased hugely after re-unification... due to gate-keeper migration... ...if you don't get the rules of the game... ...ruin your work by criticizing circumstances... then no wonder. You end up on the streets, as artist without body of work, and without money. And you approve? Well, that's how it is nowadays. What total capitalist kitsch! Anyway, fortunately for you Wilhelmine Askwitt has always supported your work. Having, under her auspices such an excellent project stall... that sort of blemish, she'd never allow herself. So it all depends on luck. - That's what you need. - I see. Good luck! Welcome to our Brecht yoga. I'm glad so many of you turned up. Just an introduction for the new arrivals. Brecht yoga is about what is sold to you... as a natural state in our daily lives. Comprehend it as a constructed effort. This includes the human body, which is also amended. Close your eyes and... try to conceive of the society in its historical context. The small worlds within you are front divisions of larger battles. Events do not speak for themselves. Their sense needs to be elicited. A fellow human being is the prerequisite for observation. Naturalism is a surrogate for realism. Unity is disrupted. Be indiscreet, there's many of you! Status report: In Berlin. Face the violence of language. Gaze out of the window. There's a knock. Hello, DHL with a parcel for you. Please sign here. Thanks. New textbooks, pile #2. Status report. Tip all messengers! I intend to use current means of production... positivistically. Invest, into a better time. Can't succeed if the available means don't suffice to set up bearable conditions for production. I don't own the means of production. Someone else does, many others. Everyone, no-one. Who all threaten to deny me them. Expression threatens survival. Non-expression even more so. Open one door, shut another, well, well! Viktor von Wolzogen, why did you never rescind your title? 'Cos I'd bear the same initials as a VW car! You're authentic in your self-pity. Turn that into rage, not hugs! What can I do, how? I'm constantly busy with proposals. If at least I knew who I'm dealing with. You no longer see your job as a privilege. As it's such a problem for you you see you're still a bourgeois lefty. Despite your surname. I'm incapable of aesthetically enjoying everyday life... of enjoying it aesthetically in all its immediacy. You know, I'd just like to enjoy everyday life fully. Are you still smoking? Why doesn't anyone smoke? Well, the aesthetic fulfilment in the experience of everyday life... I don't manage it anymore. What with me as a curator. It's a disaster! A curator who can't conceive his daily life aesthetically... What's there to curate for him? Festivals? We gave up on everyday life for a couple of holidays which are a lot of work for anyone invited. Everyday life's got disbanded. We need to get it back, as an aesthetic experience. Or there'll only be festivals. - Hi. - Hi! Super jacket. Look. I'm looking at Bruno Derksen's new work. - Know him? - Of course! There's also a video. Clearly the material doesn't determine the context for its use. Nor does the artist's intent. Can't you detect traces of either nevertheless? The off of things, how do you show that? Not at all. Or at least not entirely. But you can take a stance, can't you? Listen to this. Central, high class, new build residential property. New luxurious fittings, fully fitted kitchen... Shower cubicle, floor length glazing. 43 sqm at 711 excluding charges. Penthouse flat near Alexanderplatz for immediate occupation. Floor length glazing, newly plastered walls, fitted kitchen... 64 sqm at 1,143 Euro, excluding charges. - Three-room flat, modern layout. - Don't do this to us. - It's always the same. - Fitted kitchen. - Please stop! - ...515 Euro excluding charges. - It's interesting for a while. - I'm fucking annoyed. A roof top extension in Mitte. It's unbearable, Hamza. Stop it! - Merhaba. - Hey, Asta! Look what I found in the archives. Images from history books. Kreuzberg, in the old days. Very interesting. Know what this is? A Gececondu. Ironic they had them back then already. Have a look. - What's new with you? - We just finished our mural. - I can show you, if you want. - Yes, of course. Tins of paint, spirits. Stage platforms. There's another cupboard full. Boxes and metal bits. There's a shopping trolley, if you need one. Solid steel rods. Stuff on rolls. These are for putting up flags. Some sort of lamps. - Got any screens? Where are they? - Screens! I should know, here, or there. - Let's look there. - We've various ones. - Harmony cable? - No, HDMI cable. - Three. - Right, three times. Got it. - And H 6? - HD beamers, four of them. - Blu-ray...? - Player, seven. Seven? Oh Lord! You're taking the lot! - V-H-S! - Yes, two of those. Right, got it. Stackable TV sets. - Two again. - I'd say so. H-I-8 video camera. - We only need one of those. - Right, at last. My God, I feel like a sponge. Would that be okay? If you want me to lose my job... okay! Please sign. Well, that's done, finally. Right. What's up, Macchiavelli? What's so urgent and confidential? Sniffing in a club on Monday morning serves the purposes of the Berlin Marketing Council. Think of "Dazed in Berlin"... the Arts Council's favorite project... Suddenly 1.2 million came up, out of nowhere... for some so-called performance display. But spot me, and there's no money. "Empty coffers, we sincerely regret..." You've got to watch it. You should really watch it. So you're not misconceived. You've got to watch it. Watch it, watch it, watch it! You've got to watch it with what you're doing! You watch it! Really watch what you do, so you're not misconceived. If I may give you some advice. Secrets create social boundaries. Without secrets, there's neither guilt nor shame. Moebius, no-one knows what we do here. You just need to pick up how to smile. Mildly and graciously. Just like me. Usually that's all you need. If it still comes to the crunch, say: I promise to do my best. I'll do my best. I'll do all the best. Anything in I can, I'll do it. But my hands are tied. My hands are tied. Regrettably, my hands are tied. My hands are tied. Let's play some music. What did you bring? Schoenberg, opus 38, chamber symphony #2, first movement. Adagio, performed by Solistenensemble Kaleidoskop. 1942, we'll get to that later. Film Enemies of Today, Film Friends of Tomorrow. My guest is Asta Andersen. Let's get back to the script. In the 1980s a commissioning editor said to the film maker: Great how you only need little money, no huge pro-team and 16 mm max. But try video, it's new and even cheaper. Quite, yet at the same time a certain Guenther Rohrbach left W-German public service TV, fought the "fateful power of auteur directors" introduced "amphibian" film to Bavaria studios for action movies then re-sold them to TV so expensively... that there wasn't even money left for video. "The Boat", Hunters Getting Hunted, as the logline went. A Nazi u-boat, imagine that. It's why I insist on mentioning Mr Rohrbach. As Brecht notes in his exile-diary in 1942: Indignation, this socially productive affect, mustn't merely be directed at conditions, as it would de-personalise them and they'd thus appear immutable. You'd think film producers misappropriated the amphibian into a metaphoric prefix for their militant business-plans. Biologically, what is an amphibian? Amphibian animals could live both aquatically and on solid ground. - Aha? - ...if you let them. Frogs, newts, axolotl. But many species face extinction. Could they do Youtube, if you let them? Sure, if you paid them, maybe. You're preparing an exhibition, titled "Das Kino. Die Kunst". What's it about? We ask why audio visual art isn't in the cinema and on TV? Why shelter with other, older forms of aesthetic communication? Theatre, galleries, performing and fine arts... why did it have to resort to that? Why do post-war institutions resist the aesthetic transformation of their own ethical and political conception so firmly now? How would you re-cultivate that space amphibiously? Non-violently, of course. Ideally via some re-enchantment. Has democracy become too unwieldy for the institutions? That's what it looks like. Isn't it time to think of neo without liberal? - See what remains? - Yes, precisely. - Asta, thank you for talking to us. - My pleasure. That's it, we'll freeze her budget. Terms and Conditions #2, #2. We'd only prospected it, anyway. - Our hands are tied. - Indeed. But don't blame me later. I didn't say I would. Classic case of not heeding advice. While I was trying to dismantle my own heterosexual power position and lost my job, some Normative Cows upgraded their given privileged status. Without the slightest misgiving they posit the precept of the growing importance of the gate keeper as a career aspiration for university graduates. The doorman of this organic food store shakes his head. The aforementioned subjects regularly shop with him. They're easier to handle than the Iggy Pop lookalikes, whom he's supposed to observe. Just recently, one of them was caught. He'd eloped from drugs rehab... and got caught red-handed with organic lipstick and eye liner. He'd bet, he'd just be referred back to the clinic. After restraining him near the fresh produce counter police arrived heavily armed, siren ringing. - How did you get the job? - Job centre arranged it. Is your skin colour relevant to the assignment? I'm afraid, yes. Have you got a new title for your work yet? Cool, Cool, and Cool. - Hey, hello! - Hello. Just did the groceries. We're in a brain-storming session. Kerstin, What is Vogue? Are you out of your mind? It's half past eight. Do you know where my head is? I'm just bloody tired. What is fashion? Vogue is fashion! Vogue is romance, passion... yearning, aspiration and success. What is Vogue? Vogue is luxury. Temptation and mystery. Light, fire and Riefenstahl. Vogue is between proletarian obscenity and aristocratic perversion... which doesn't work in Germany. What a pity! Vogue is career. Alone at the top. And men! Expensive men! Expensive perfume. Vogue is knowing the rules of the game. Is inspiration and creativity. Comfort isn't enough. Luxury! Fashion! Trends! Beauty! And people! Sex! Romance! Love! And drama! What is Vogue? Vogue is cognac, Prozac... - Kerstin, Hannah... - Hello! - Did you see Leontine? - I don't even know who she is. Why are you all at my place again? We waited for you, it's so boring. We're shooting a video. In my position, why shouldn't I say what I think. An opinion? It was the facts, the truth. I just said, what everyone knows anyway. Cancelling my outside funding is really crass. Everyone heard, but, do you think anyone called? Don't count on any solidarity from the scene. "There being too many curators anyway..." Isn't it what you always tell each other in your elitist projects? You should ask who benefits. It's a perfidious rhetoric of limiting resources. Producing superfluous people in that way. Us girls need every one of us. The penchant for didactics I must've got from you. What will you do now? This sort of debate should be a normal social practice. Not a public extermination. You go on curating in the morning, fight it out in court later, and after dinner, if you have the strength, you do urban gardening. Without ever having been a lawyer or a gardener, let alone doing curatorial studies academically. You know, I'm so angry. I could throw bombs into everything. If you're in the right, you don't ask, you fight. If necessary, in court. And in your case it's necessary. Who's the current Upper Cultural Intentionist? - It's Wilhelmine. - What? Her? No. You battle it out four years, and still can't do a show. She has the excellence cluster Normative Cows on board. Makes you want to be a Platonian. I don't believe it! Philosophers! Get out of the polis! - Need money? - Yes. Money. I've got money. Extermination War seems to have made you mean. The War ended as far as I'm concerned. Long ago. War never ends. Names change, but as you see, things remain the same. What do I see? Where? What are you doing here? Where were you? I read it in the papers. So I came as fast as I could. - Double pronto! - Right, Mr Pronto! Are they serious? Very serious indeed. If we collaborated... - would we share everything? - Certainly. Now, which shoes best suit my outfit? Black or white? White. Hello, Asta. Hang on a bit, right? Art, would you call Waris for me? What do I tell him? Tell him I'm in trouble. - Hello, how are you? - Hey! I'm the student writing this. I'm still here. The system hasn't found an excuse to expel me. We named the academy Dsiga Vertov Academy. His films taught us not only to make films, but to be political to make political films that change the system. It is our fundamental task to help any oppressed individual and the entire Proletariate in their aim to find guidance in their circumstances. - Any news? - Not really. Perhaps we should ask our friends at WikiLeaks to look into Ms Askwitt's PhD - on political philosophy. - Oh yes. I'll introduce you to Noa. - Hello, I'm Asta. - Great, I heard so much about you. Let me explain. - Did Leontine say anything? - A bit, yes. I'm setting up an online archive for audio visual material, primarily video. Working title: astamaterial. - Fitting, right? - Great, what sort of stuff is it? We deal in the history of German higher education since 1945. How do you visualise that? Or make it accessible? Our idea was to take film and video documenting contemporary situations, and archive it here and online. It's our hypothesis that the history of universities is determined by conformism as well as resistance. Every new student generation fights for its own rights. Or they rather decide to adapt to given circumstances. Both are an active stance. Both require taking action. We used to assume that non-resistance meant inaction. - Actually it isn't. - Precisely. It could be beneficial to be aware of these reflections and their historicity. Not in order to impose our present time as superior to the past, but to contemporise the past as an experience that's not out of reach. As a resource and critique, on which you can build. But first we have to rescue the material from obscurity. We're intrinsic to history. The online archive is a sewing machine, bonding our present with our past. If we want to imagine a future the seam must never end. So we continue sewing. An end to low wages and compulsory work in temp agencies. No to wages lower than 10 Euro. Freeze rents at four Euro ex charges. Create conditions for a dignified life. No to police force against tenants' protests. No hollow campaign mottos. Social housing at affordable rents. Also in central locations. The right to Kotti, the right to Berlin. The right to the city, the right to freedom. Herr Gauck. Oh, what an honour! I read you're coming, but didn't think we'd meet. Asta, hello! How are you? And in such pleasant company. - Waris is a collector. - Hello, what a pleasure. What brings you here? Waris only knows central Berlin, and I'm introducing him to the delights of Brandenburg. How nice. Thanks to you I now have a lot of free time. Oh really, dearest! I can't believe my luck running into you here. You know, on reflection... considering how long things take... we at the Intentiousness came to the conclusion... ...you'll be yearning for summer days off... ...with imminent restructuring... as soon as the day after tomorrow... new scope for experimentation etc. You're being kicked upstairs, tranquillised... so you won't neither harm nor hurt yourself... And we're demonstrating how we're open to criticism. Thank God for democracy. Communism has been vanquished... Yet the invisible hand of the free market economy... mustn't naturally devour everything! At least not where we can intervene. You did everything right. You persevered, you didn't cave in, bore what there was to bear... I have the contract ready... Kindly discuss the rest with my office. Things like the budget. Won't be much... All the best. Where's my car? See you soon, Asta, good-bye. See you, Asta. There's humming from outside / entering this room / which is light, spacious, open / walls indiscernible. The soft glimmer / of something long lost / a forgotten promise / gradually fulfilled. What is this noise, beaver / How did I get here / Are you friends / Have I ceased to exist? The machines in our hands / paws, and claws / created cyber bees / which belong to us all. They fly across meadows / where spring never ends / They drink from blossoms / produce their secretions. Here honey flows eternally / surplus and delight / This is the heavens / and earth as well. Earth is a garden / a commune of all / The world is ours / we may live forever. Chop, chop! Stop rent rises! A new work by Hannah Husching. Hannah, for God's sake, what are you doing? You call that your new work? It's discourse denial. It's discourse denial. We're not in the loony bin! What should people think? Do you know how expensive the equipment is? You'd never afford it! I'm begging you... Stop it! Asta, would you come along? Asta, things will turn out alright. Hop is visiting from the future. Hop speaks through me. The Council Republic of the Future sent us Hop. They opened an embassy. The embassy compound lies just behind me. It's where our future begins. Asta, things will turn out fine!
