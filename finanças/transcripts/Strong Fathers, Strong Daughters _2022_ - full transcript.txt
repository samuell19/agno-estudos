[♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [PHONE RINGING] Steve Parston. Thank you, sir. That's good news. Excellent. Okay. We'll see you soon. [♪♪♪] Yes! [BOTTLE POPS] Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to thank you all for the hard work you've put in on this deal. Your service, your sacrifice, your time away from families was worth it. [EVERYONE CHEERING] [♪♪♪] Mommy, do you like your flowers? I do, I love them. What about--? Mommy, no! Got it! Hold on tight, okay? Don't let go. Thank you! [♪♪♪] [CAR HONKING] [CAR ENGINE WHIRRING] What did you do this time? Excuse me? You only bring flowers when you're in trouble. Well, today is different. [DOOR BANGS] [♪♪♪] Connie, you got a surprise! CONNIE: Zoey, this is not what it's about. I'm protecting you and you should be able to recognize that. And second of all-- ZOEY: It's not fair! CONNIE: You are not going and that's final! Oh, this is so stupid. It's just a party. A college party, Zoey. Oh, whatever. Hey. Just because you got invited does not give you permission to go, especially with an older boy. You don't even know him. Exactly! Now take off that makeup and do your homework. Whatever she said. [GRUNTS] [SIGHS] [DOOR SLAMS] It's no wonder animals eat their young. Hey, who's that kid out there with Bridget? Oh, that's Jake from school. Her first crush. When did that happen? Well, life doesn't stop while you're at work, honey. You got the Woodford account. They signed this morning. What? Stop being happy! It's not fair. [DOOR SLAMS] You know what this means, don't you? The teenage brain isn't fully developed. I get to bring on Abby. I mean, the timing couldn't be better. Oh, well, you really-- Oh, trust me, they're gonna love her. Hey, when does she get in? Well, she left about-- She's not coming from downtown, is she? The roads are nuts. [FEET STOMPING] Oh. Happy now? [SIGHS] So happy. [DOOR SLAMS] [♪♪♪] [CAR ENGINE WHIRRING] [♪♪♪] [SIGHS] Okay. [CAR DOOR BANGS] Wall Street Journal called. Guess who they wanna interview? Honey, that's amazing. I'm gonna be on TV. CONNIE: Abby may have a lot to share with us as well, so just try to contain yourself a little bit. I'm contained, I'm contained. This concerns her, too. Buenas noches! [ABBY & CONNIE SCREAMING] Hey! CONNIE: Look at you! Do you like it? My baby, yes, you look gorgeous. Get over here. [LAUGHS] I got a surprise for you. Oh, really? At least let her get settled first. I'm sure she's had a long day. After dinner then. Cool 'cause I have a surprise for you, too. Abby! Squidge! Did you see my sign? I sure did. I thought that was Michelangelo. Zoey! Oh, what's going on? Are you okay? Can I come live with you, please? It's like a prison here. It gets better, I promise. They're getting worse. I swear, I'm gonna gnaw my leg off. Not now, we're about to eat. Ugh. Hey. ABBY: Can I help? CONNIE: Yes, thank you. Okay, good. ABBY: Yeah, yeah, grab that, perfect. CONNIE: All right. I wanna hear about Mexico. Mom, the orphanage is amazing. Like these kids, they're hilarious. I just, I wish I could adopt them all. Who's funding it? Well, it's churches mostly. Oz's dad is a pastor, so he spends a lot of his time raising money. Actually, that's my surprise. They'll be here tomorrow. How fun! Mm-hm, well, actually his parents will be here in a few days, but Oz is driving up tomorrow. He wants to talk to you. Who? Oswaldo, my boyfriend. I can't wait for you guys to meet him. Does he need a job? Not exactly. Well, what time? 'Cause you and I have a meeting tomorrow. We do? Well, that's my surprise. You remember those investment ideas you pitched me at Christmas? Well, we just landed the Woodford account. What, Dad! [LAUGHS] That's amazing. Our first meeting is at 11 and you are gonna be front and center. What? Your pitch deck sealed the deal, so I'm gonna have you present it to the board. Wait, you actually pitched that to them? But that was just hypothetical. That was just my thesis project. Well, it's a lot more than that now, kiddo. Everybody is so excited. This is it. You and me, team Parston. [LAUGHS] [BOTH IMITATE EXPLOSION] [♪♪♪] BOARD MEMBER: What about the downside? Well, certainly, we'll put hedges in place. And don't forget that Dodd-Frank limits our exposure. Since we'll hold the initial tranche, we'll have equity to offset any losses. We'll manage risk while leaving room for a significant upside. STEVE: So feel free to look over the handout, then we'll go to lunch. [LAUGHS] That was brilliant. Oh, my gosh, Dad, I'm shaking. Gotta give you credit, Steve, she doesn't disappoint. We look forward to working with you. Oh, thank you, but actually I just graduated. I don't really work here. Actually, you do. Surprise. What? No dad, you don't, you don't understand. What's there to understand? This is a big moment for you, for us. Dad, I can't work for your company. What are you doing? This is what we talked about. This is what you've been working towards. I know, but things are different now. It's not that I don't appreciate the opportunity, I do. What things? I don't think this is the place. This is totally the place. This is our dream. This is why we sent you to business school so we could build something together. You know, we always-- Look, Oz and I are getting married! What? In three weeks. That's why he wants to talk to you. I can't work here. We're moving to Kenya. Oh. What? We'll take the stairs. You two can meet us. I was gonna wait to tell you, but he asked me last week. I met him on a mission trip. Is this a joke? Is that even real gold? Yes, it's real, ah! [CHUCKLES] You can't get married. We had plans. You and me, we played Monopoly. I let you be the car. Who even is this guy? He's an entrepreneur. He's a problem solver. He's the guy you should hire, except he wouldn't take the job. Why not? What's his training? Where'd he go to school? Well, he didn't exactly. He helps his family at the orphanage. Look, it's in his blood. That's why we wanna go to Africa. You just met this guy. It's been seven months. I love him. Oh, what do you even know about love? You just-- What? Dad, I'm an adult. No. Abby, adults have jobs, adults pay rent and pay for their own food. Have you done any of those things? I didn't ask for your money. Okay, okay, let me just get this straight. You wanna turn down your dream job with your own office right out of the gate, not to mention an expense account and your own parking space so you can live in a mud hut with a guy named Oz? [SIGHS] [♪♪♪] ABBY: It's like he still thinks I'm eight. Tell me about it. Sweetheart, time moves very differently for dads, and you see yourself as a grown woman, ready to make your own way, and your father still sees his little girl home from school. I know, I know. He just needs some time to adjust. Why is that my problem? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] This might hurt a little bit. [♪♪♪] Are you proud of yourself? Me? What about her? Did she tell you she thinks she's getting married? Did she tell you about Cambodia? ABBY: Kenya! We don't even know this kid. No, but you know your kid, Now get in there and talk to her. [♪♪♪] Stay strong. [SIGHS] You really were great today. Thank you. Oh. And I'm sorry. I didn't mean to blindside you. This is your fault, you know. What? You know how you always said you were praying for my future husband? Well, it worked. Well, I, I'm pretty sure I was praying for a guy with a job. Can't you just think of it as gaining a son? A son? You always wanted one. Okay, I'll make you a deal. I'll do my best to get to know him, but you don't be in such a hurry to run off to Africa. Settle it the old fashioned way? You still got your cleats? [SCOFFS] [CHUCKLES] [SISTER SLEDGE'S "WE ARE FAMILY" PLAYING] ♪ We are family ♪ ♪ I got all my sisters With me ♪ All right, all right! Abby's open!

That reminds me, these are for you. They're from the children of Malavida. Oh, wow, they made these? Oz's mom is an amazing artist, so she teaches all the kids. Oh, that's so nice, thank you. And these are for you. It's pretty. There you go. Ooh, I want red. Pink's better. BRIDGET: Thank you. And this is for you. Oh, look at that. Yeah. I hope you like it. Yeah, huh. Abby, how about a hand with the salad? Bridge, you wanna grab the breadsticks? I think we're ready. I can help. [PHONE CHIMES] Hey Dad, can I go to an end-of-year thing tomorrow? Mom said no parties. Oh, it's a daytime thing. It's just a few friends. It's no big deal. Oh, I guess that'd be okay then. I'm just so happy that I'm home. I can't believe you're graduating. I know. I'm proud of you. Isn't it amazing? Huge event. I can't believe it. I'm sure you were wondering why we were getting married so soon. Never crossed my mind. [CHUCKLES] [STEVE LAUGHS] Is, is there something that we should know about? Dad! Oh, no, no, no, no, no. It's not like that, sir. Our missionary organization wants us to be in Kenya by the end of next month, and we were hoping that we could get married before then. To allow time for a honeymoon. Kenya, can you believe it? Oh, honey. [STEVE & CONNIE CHUCKLE] Well, we'll be joining a team in one of the villages there. They'll be teaching us Swahili and everything. How long will you be there? Three years. [COUGHS] CONNIE: Honey! Sorry. You okay? Mm, mm. That's quite a commitment. Well, we just really wanna share the love of Jesus with them, and that takes trust, and trust takes time. So what all will you be doing in this village? Oh, we'll be helping to build wells. And set up local businesses. Yeah, yeah. What kind of businesses? Mm, fantastic. Actually, it's pretty cool. So every child starts with a chicken, and then once they've shown they can sell the eggs at market and turn a profit, they trade up for a goat, and then eventually a cow. [CHUCKLES] Wow, that's amazing. Oh, that's a perfect use of a $200,000 MBA. What? Why don't you go get some more water, sweetheart? I can do that, I can do that. Thank you. Thank you. Behave yourself. Dad, relax, it'll be an adventure. And who's gonna pay for this little adventure? We plan to raise support. So there's been no mention of a job? So you haven't told us yet how you got engaged. Well, at Nueva Vida, there's a courtyard where everyone comes to celebrate Mexican Independence Day. Cinco de Mayo. Yes. Oh, well actually, that is a common misconception among Americans. Dia de la Independencia is a much more significant day in Mexican culture. Yeah, it came way before the events where you celebrate with tequila and tacos. [LAUGHS] Of course. Interesting. Right, anyway, right in the middle of it, he just dropped on one knee. You know those moments when everything else just fades away and it's just you and the most important person in the whole world. I haven't experienced that yet. Well, it happens, and I said yes. [BRIDGET GIGGLING] ANNOUNCER: In breaking financial news, Parston International has announced a partnership with Woodford Limited in a deal that's lighting up the capital markets after hours. Parston CEO Steve Parston said the partnership with Woodford represents the new face of our capital management strategy by leveraging our existing holdings with new sectors developed by Woodford. Hi, you've got a minute? We will be able to offer our clients a much wider range of opportunities across the financial landscape. Stock prices of both companies are up after hours as investors seem... Listen, Mr. Parston, I, I think I owe you an apology. Oh, lucky shot, I'll heal. Yeah, that, but, but also about Abby. I know it's customary to ask the dad before the girl. I just really love your daughter and I got caught up in a moment. Maybe a phone call. I know, I know, and it won't happen again. What I mean to say is I'd like permission to marry your daughter. Oz, do you know how much you have to pay at a hotel on Boardwalk? I'm, I'm sorry? Boardwalk, next to Park Place. Oz, how well do you know my daughter? When she first got to Mexico, I watched her comfort a little boy who had just lost his parents. I had never seen such grace. She has a gift. She is unique, and vibrant, and life, my life. And I know she's got a good mind for business, which would be super helpful in the field. I know you don't wanna see her get hurt, and sir, I promise I will care for her until the day I die. [CHUCKLES] The day you die. Well, what can I say? You have my permission. Oh, thank you, Dad. Uh, Steve is fine for now. Steve, oh, okay. But we don't just want your permission, we'd like your blessing. How about we work up to that? Okay, yeah, of course. [SQUEALS] Thank you, Daddy! [CHUCKLES] Hey. [♪♪♪] CONNIE: It's just up here on the left. STEVE: Who are all these people? CONNIE: Would you just at least try to be somewhat pleasant for Abby, if nothing else? STEVE: A serve day? Why can't we meet his parents at a restaurant like normal people? Honey, we are going to be sharing grandchildren with these people. Don't you wanna know a little bit about them? Besides, you could use the little vitamin D. You made it! Hey. Hi. This is a safe place to park? It's just no guarantees. You wearing that, Dad? I'm gonna go into work after. Here, use my gloves. I don't really use these. Oh, you'll have to excuse him. His idea of working with his hands is writing a check. Are your parents here? Oh, they went out to grab supplies. They'll be right back. Oh, okay. Thank you guys for coming. Of course. Come on, this way. Let's go. You said we're gonna hand out sandwiches or something. Oh, honey, just go with it. [SIGHS] [♪♪♪] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] All right. Load me up. [GROANS] You okay? Yeah, yeah. You sure? Yeah, yeah, more. All right. Let's go. [GRUNTS] You know, I really appreciate you doing this. Yeah. It's our family church. It's nothing fancy, but we like to keep it up. You okay? Oh, yeah, yeah. Light work. [♪♪♪] ABBY: So what do you think? Well, he certainly seems capable. Oh. ABBY: Oh. Maybe Dad can learn something. Oh, yeah. [BANGS] [VAN HONKING] Here they are! [♪♪♪] [BANGS] [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] You must be Mrs. Parston. Connie. Nice to meet you. Thank you, likewise. I'm so glad you're here. Oh, thank you. [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] He's wondering if you're my sister. Oh, I like him already, oh. Hey! [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] [BELLA SPEAKS IN SPANISH] Mama, Papi, this is Abby's dad. Steve Parston. [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] It is wonderful to meet you. You, you must be so proud of this girl. Oh, we love her so much. A match made in heaven, huh? So I've heard. You guys okay? Oz got you started? Yeah, just slinging some concrete, getting the workout in. Is your back okay? It's, it's fine. [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] What did he, what did he say? He said you'll feel it tomorrow. BELLA: Connie, would you like to give me a hand? CONNIE: Yes. We're going to paint a mural for the children. Oh, how fun. Of course, absolutely. You good, honey? Of course, just getting started. That's the spirit, amigo. CARLOS: Slow and easy is how you do it. This is how you do it. How much longer are you guys in town? Another week or so, raising support, then it's back to Mexico for a bit before the wedding. You ever been to Mexico? Yeah, yeah, a couple times. Cabo, Cancun. You know, Oz tells me that you gave them your blessing. Congratulations. Permission, yeah. No offense to your son, but I just don't know if Abby's really ready. Okay, okay. Or maybe you don't know if you're really ready. I've been there. You have daughters? Three, they're all married now, but I know how hard it is to let your girl go, let another man become more important in her life. But you've raised her well. She's a capable young woman. STEVE: I wasn't expecting Kenya. Yeah, if God has ordained it, who are we to argue? Who are we? We're their fathers. Long strokes so it stays even. You've got two other daughters, right? I've got something for you. What is it? Trust me, it's perfect for you right now. [ABBY GIGGLING] OZ: There, you got it. It looks good. Great. May I cut in? Oh. See, the trick is to hold the brush close, stay in control. Well, actually-- Just like we painted your room in third grade. Do you remember, pink sparkle? Yeah, well, I remember Mom painting, but. Yeah, well, we all have our different skill set. You just give it a try, just small moves. That's much better. You're like, okay. Oh, wow, you are really good. I can't draw a lick. Patience and practice, like with so many things, right? Mm. [CHURCH BELL RINGING] Oh, there they are. How wonderful! I didn't know churches had those anymore. Carlos likes to keep them working. He's sentimental that way. We had bells chime to start our wedding. Oh, that is so sweet. My husband is a true servant. He'll run himself ragged to help those in need. CONNIE: Sounds like Abby. We've loved having her at Nueva Vida. She is so smart. Oh, well, she's got her dad to thank for that. I'm sure you were a big part of it. Well, yeah, but it was really Steve who took the lead. He read to her early, did flashcards on the computer, taught her to read a spreadsheet when she was five. [LAUGHS] He was all in. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [BIRDS SCREECHING] [WIND HOWLING] [♪♪♪] Hey! Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh! [BODY THUDS] [PAINT SPLASHES] Steve, oh! Oh, no! [SIGHING] [♪♪♪] [PEOPLE LAUGHING] I bet you never thought that the church would be donating clothes to you, huh? Welcome to the family, my friend. You okay? [SCOFFS] It's just a flesh wound. I'm, I'm sorry if I-- No, no, I, I was overreaching. Mm-hm. Well, when you get a second, I would love for you to take a look at this. Okay, Oz, would you like to lead us in grace? Of course. [OZ SPEAKING IN SPANISH] My son is a good man, just like his father. You can trust him with Abby. So Abby, have you two decided what kind of wedding you wanna have? Oh, uh, something small. We originally thought we'd just get married in Mexico, so we haven't put much on our wedding registry. Just like a few things that we'll need for Africa. How would you feel if we had the ceremony in our backyard? Oh, yeah! I think we can do a little bit better than that. No, really, Dad. She used to make me play wedding all the time. She dreamt about getting married in a white castle, drinking from a chocolate fountain, dancing with fireworks in the background. That's true. Yeah, I was seven then, but I can't believe you remember that. It wasn't just your dream. I finally found it. This is wisdom, my friend. Read it carefully. Looks like it's been through battle. With three daughters, consider it a field manual. Well, thank you. [PHONE CHIMES] Bet it's great. It's the school, it's automated. Zoey was marked absent today. Zoey, why am I getting a call from the school? Where are you? What? Read the book. ZOEY: Dad said I could go. I never said you could skip school. Whatever. You lied to me. I did not! A ditch day to the beach. You never asked me where I was going. She's impossible. You're impossible. Look, I just want you to be honest with me. Why is that so hard to understand? It's kind of hard to be honest with someone who doesn't let you do anything. Why is that so hard to understand? All right, that's it, you're grounded. What? Go to your room. That's not fair! Now! Ugh! [SIGHS] Why has she gotta be like that? Just try to have some patience. She's 16, she's not done cooking yet. Can we microwave her? [♪♪♪] They're not gonna have any hot showers in Kenya, I'll tell you that. Abby's gonna have to wrestle a water buffalo just to take a bath. It won't be that bad. Are you kidding me? They're gonna have to walk 10 miles just to get drinking water from some muddy river, and then boil it when they get back to their hovel. Mm, you should make a list of reasons she shouldn't go. Terrorize her into staying home. Ooh, you can frame it as a wedding present. It's not a bad idea. I think they'll be happy. I think they'll be itchy and swollen. What's that? It's the book Carlos gave you. Looks really good. Oh, you are your daughter's first love. Oh, reminds me of how the girls used to climb all over you, fighting for your attention. What happened, right? Mm, maybe it'll tell you. Your daughter needs a hero. See, this is all I was trying to be. Are you sure you weren't just trying to one up your future son-in-law? It was service day, I was trying to serve. And all those suggestions for the dream wedding, the castles and fireworks. She only gets married once. Why settle for less than what she really wants? And you're sure of what she really wants? Listen, there's this wedding coordinator that a lot of my clients have used. Why don't we just set a meeting? Couldn't hurt to check out some options, right? Just to be sure. [♪♪♪] [GASPS] Oh, my gosh, Dad. And parking for 200. Who loves you, baby? Okay, I am seeing this. This could work. Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome! Oh, you must be the beautiful bride. And her gorgeous groom. Oh, so lovely to meet you both. I'm Crystal, come with me. Let our adventure begin! We have a variety of locations for you to exchange your vows. We have a traditional archway, of course, with a lovely view of the lagoon. BRIDGET: Look, they have turtles! Oh, we can dress them in wedding attire, if you like, for nominal fee, of course. And for a more exotic flavor, our lush tropical palm garden makes for the perfect location for you to say your I dos and I don'ts. Abby, Abby, over here, and, uh... Oz. Oz, yes, ah, if I only had a brain. Oh, look at you two, So precious, so in love. Stan! Okay, give her a kiss on the cheek. Oh, and give her a high five. And how about back to back? Oh, that is a wrap. Wait, I think I blinked. Okay, these will be available to you on the way out. The first copy is complimentary, but we do have other packages, of course. We also do engagement parties, couple showers, retirement, celebrations, and funerals. [LAUGHS] But for now, let's plan a wedding! [GASPS] Am I dreaming? I don't know, but I'll tell you this, I don't wanna wake up. [♪♪♪] Oh, can I just move in here? Oh, Stan, here they are, here they are. And now, especially made for the princess and her prince, a sampling of menu options for the ultimate matrimonial culinary experience, all perfectly prepared to your father's specifications. Stan. First, a lovely array of appetizers, all privately sourced and organically grown. My humble recommendation is the Almas caviar stuffed truffle paired perfectly with the white grape [SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] imported from Austria. Ooh! Nice try. Then, for our main course, we have three options. From the land, A5 Wagyu filet mignon center cut to perfection, melts in your mouth. Try, try, try, try, Abby, try, try. Oh, wow, it's so good. So good. ABBY: Wow. From the sea, fresh bluefin tuna directly from Tokyo. And from the air, breast chicken from Eastern France. Chickens don't fly. Oh, you're a bright one, aren't you? [LAUGHS] And then for the big finish. Don't mind if I do. We have imported a Mexican dessert to give your big day that personal flavor. Oh, Dad, that is so sweet. It's spicy. [LAUGHS] Why is that funny? Well, I mean, that's habanero cake. It's for quinceaneras. It's burning. Yeah, it's a habanero, it's one of the hottest chili peppers in the world. Awesome! Stan, could you get a glass of milk for the father of the bride? It seems like someone's got a tender palate. Can I have some water, please? Oh, here, let him try some champagne. Can I take that? Whoa, oh, oh, okay. It's expensive. It's worse. Don't panic. Stan, hurry up! [BAND SINGING IN SPANISH] CONNIE: I did love the chicken. And the steak, that's what we're thinking. Yeah, that could be a really good. ABBY: I think it's a good compromise. Oh, honey, you okay? I can't feel my tongue. You think this will wash out? Mm. Could you guys give us a minute, please? Oh, yeah, of course. Sure, yeah. [♪♪♪] You don't like it. It's not that. I mean, it's amazing. It's just the food alone could fund a year in the field. Yeah, I know, but I mean, my dad's paying for it, so. Would this make you happy? Not if you're not. I just thought our wedding would be a little bit more... Us. Yeah. Come on. You know, manage your expectations. Hey, you guys decide what you want? Well, we were just talking and what would you think, and I'm just throwing this out there, if we made a compromise? No tuxedos on the turtles. Yeah, well. Actually, we've been talking about wanting a couple's shower, you know, kinda like an engagement party, so what if we had that here, but then just had the wedding in the backyard? You know, keep it simple. Crystal can still do the decorations. Abbs, this is what you've always wanted. This is your wedding. I know, but it's not just for me. [♪♪♪] It's like he's got some kind of spell over her. What happened to all that independence? Honey, they're forming a union, for better or worse. Well, I say worse. I think a couple shower's actually a great idea. That way they can invite all of their friends and we can invite a few of ours. We can? It's not unheard of. You can write a speech, show her how much you really care. [♪♪♪] How many friends? [♪♪♪] Big shower this weekend, gentlemen. I know you'll wanna be there. Put it on the calendar. We'll see you there. Here you are, we'll see you there, can't wait. Gentlemen, here you go, we'll see you there. Okay, one for you, madame. I can't wait to see you. Bonnie, couple's shower this weekend. Oh, Abby, I remember when she used to play with the pencils and the calculators. Well, now she'll be playing with lions and hyenas. Hey Jimmy, how you doing buddy? We're gonna see you at the shindig this weekend. Big shower, no gift too big. We'll see you there. Dave! What are these, hieroglyphics? Here, give me the pen. I'll do it. [SPEAKS IN SWAHILI] That means pen in Swahili. How do you say lick the envelopes? Oh, [SPEAKS IN SWAHILI] Really? No, that means I love you. Ooh, how do you say hopeless romantic? Oh, I can't wait to teach our kids. Little Oz. We need to find a good school, for sure. Oh, how about you raise the money and I'll build it? Hey guys, have you seen Dad? Um, office. Don't make me separate you two, okay? Honey, I'm headed to the salon. Remember to pick up your suit from the dry cleaners. Did you know the State Department has a travel advisory for where they're going? Shouldn't you be writing your speech? Yeah, yeah, I'm, I'm working on it. Well, maybe ask the girls if they wanna say something. You, you really want to give Zoey the microphone? Or Bridget then? Could be kind of cute. Love you. You too. [♪♪♪] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [CONNIE LAUGHING] Is it just me or do you have more clients here than Abby has friends? I think they're just showing their support. Funny, I don't recall Abby registering for an $800 espresso machine. Ooh. Just magical, am I right? It's wonderful, Crystal, really. Oh, I can't wait to get started at your house tomorrow, but for now, let's get this party started. Dan! Dad, did you bring my speech? I wanna know what you wrote. Speech you wrote? I just made suggestions. It's on the iPad. How do you pronounce D-Y-S-E-N-T-E-R-Y? Dysentery, what are you reading? And now put your hands together for the princess of the party, the groom of the room, the couple in the castle, Abby and Oz! [GUESTS CHEERING] What happened to the dress we bought her? Lighten up, honey, they look adorable. [GUESTS CHEERING] Abby, you're so beautiful. [GUESTS CLAPPING] Princess, look at you. Right this way, right this way, my princess. Here we are. Sir, here we go, have a seat there, okay. [♪♪♪] Hello, everyone! Connie and I would like to thank you all for gathering here today to help us shower Abby and Oz with love and gifts, lots and lots of gifts. Look at that. [LAUGHS] I just wanna take this opportunity as the one that's paying for all this to say a few words about my, my first born. You know, it's, it's funny, at some point you realize your daughter's taken her last ride on your shoulders, and for the life of me, I don't remember when that was. Abby, here you stand at the brink of who knows what, and I think about all of the experiences that you've had, your education, all the potential that's right here, and I just know that you'll make a wise decision about your future. I really hope. But no matter what you decide, you'll always be my little girl. A toast to Abby! [CHUCKLES] And, uh, Oz. Oh, not yet, honey, you're last. And now let's bring up the couple of the hour. I think they have a few things they'd like to say, come on. [GUESTS CHEERING] Thank you all for coming, really. You're probably wondering why we're dressed like this. As some of you know, my parents have dedicated their lives to the mission fields. Abby and I feel the same calling. On your table, there's a letter that gives an overview of how we wanna share God's love with our friends in Kenya. But we need your help to make that possible, and that's why there's also an envelope, and not to hard sell you, but you can write off any donations against your taxes. That's my MBA talking! Thank you so much, again, for coming. Truly, it means so much to us. Oh, and I guess my little sister's gonna say something now. Hello, all the reasons Abby should stay. Number one, we will miss her so much. Number two, there's a perfectly good job for her where she could use her degree and does not require begging for money. What's wrong? That's not the speech. Number three, Kenya is very dangerous. You actually made a list? It was your idea. I cannot believe you. I wasn't gonna frame it. Terrorists have been known to target villages, transportation hubs, and markets. Threats-- Bridget that's, that's enough. Oh! Can you not? Ooh, oh! Visitors are at risk for respiratory infections, dysentery, no hot showers. Hey, Bridget. Bridget, hey, thank you. Bridget, thank you so much. That was, well, that was more than, more than, more than enough. Hey, why don't you go sit back with Mama? Oh, there we go. Hey, wow. All right, that was the wrong file. Wasn't the speech. Those were some things to consider. You made a list of reasons you hate my choices? She wasn't supposed to read that. It's all right. Can we talk about this later? What? We're among friends, right? Say what you wanna say. Abby, Abby, don't. Go on, say it. I wanna hear it. You don't think I'm ready for that kinda life, do you, Dad? You don't even trust me to make my own decisions, do you? Do you? No, I don't, okay? Do you really wanna hear it? I think you're being idealistic and foolish. I think you are jumping headlong into a part of the world that could kill you in a hundred different ways, and you're not ready, Abby, and this is not you. [♪♪♪] Who's ready for cake? [♪♪♪] [SIGHS] You didn't read the book, did you? Is it that obvious? Well, it was either that or you thought fight for her meant fight with her. Abby and I never used to fight, and now she's, she's out of control. And whose control would that be? You're not the only father who loves her. Daughters are gifts from God, but they're not for us to keep. They're for us to guide, love, teach, and then let go. You can trust God with her future. Do you believe that? You know, we've been praying for Oz's future wife ever since he was a little boy. All this time, you've been raising an answer to prayer. You're, you're very kind. I hope someone says that about my other two someday. I've got some patching up to do. Zoey, whew, talk about fight with her. It's not a fight with flesh and blood, my friend. It's a spiritual battle. God made you her dad for a reason. Don't underestimate your voice. Lean in, spend time, be involved. You see where that's gotten me? Oh, they'll make you feel like the enemy, but don't retreat. It's part of being a strong father. [WATER SPLASHES] Is that turtle wearing a tuxedo? Yeah. Steve, Steve, Zoey's gone. What? She turned off her location, she won't answer my calls, and Abby showed me this. Zozopartay? This isn't her Instagram. They all have two, one for parents to see, and one for friends. Thetoddbodd? This guy looks 20. He and his brothers have some party house up on Charlotte Street near the college. Fight for her, huh? Can you load up the gifts and get the girls home? Yeah, what are you gonna do? I'm getting an Uber. No, forget that, I'll take you, let's go. [♪♪♪] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [TIRES SCREECHING] Do you want me to come in with you? Thanks, but I got this. [UPBEAT DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] No, no, go on, go on. No, you gotta pound it, yeah, whoo! All right! We've got rum! Oh, yes! All right, Dad! Yeah. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [UPBEAT DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] [GLASS SHATTERS] Let's go upstairs. Um. Trust me, you're gonna love my room. [PEOPLE SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] PARTIERS: Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug! [UPBEAT DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] [PEOPLE SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] Hey, hey, hey, hey, have you seen Zoey Parston? The brown hair, the red, zozopartay? Zoey! ♪ Get you with this party ♪ Oh, my gosh. Get your hands off my daughter. Hey, bro! What are you doing? Get in the car, now. My dad is here, okay? Everything is under control. He allows this? Yeah, 'cause some parents are cool. Not another word out of you. Dad, stop it. What are you doing? Whatever, dude. ZOEY: Dad, stop! There are plenty of other girls here. Stop. Whoa, whoa, whoa, what is the problem, bro? It's all good. You think this is good? My daughter's 16. You break this up right now or I'm calling the cops. Seriously, man? You wanna be that guy? Stop it. Come on. ZOEY: Dad. All right. [STEREO CLICKS OFF] All right, everybody, that's it. Party's over, sorry. CROWD: Aw! Oh, you can thank Zoey and her dad here. No, no, no, no, I don't believe you're here. Who's that guy, Zoey? It's fine, don't worry. How old is he? Do you know how old he is? I was having a fun time, then you showed up. Oh, yeah, there's no problem. Let go of me! [PEOPLE SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] [♪♪♪] [PEOPLE LAUGHING] [CAR ENGINE WHIRRING] I hate you! Zoey. She's going to hate you now, but she'll thank you later. I remember a night I wish my father had rescued me. [♪♪♪] [CAR ENGINE WHIRRING] [CONNIE SIGHS] She won't talk to me either. Have you seen these? I don't get it. I mean, Abby was never like this. Well, Zoey's not Abby. It's like I don't even know her. Well, yeah, I mean, when was the last time you made an effort to really know her, or Bridget, for that matter, took them to ice cream, went to the movies, asked how their day was? I'm getting really tired of feeling like the bad guy here. I work my butt off for this family. It's not the work they want, Steve, it's you. I remember with my dad, when things were good. I just, I just wish I'd had more time, time for hugs, more time to talk. When things were bad, I wanted time to heal. I didn't get enough of that with him before he passed away. What are you gonna want your girls to want? [♪♪♪] Hey. Stop it, don't! [PEOPLE LAUGHING] [DOOR KNOCKING] Go away! PARTIER: This could go viral. [SIGHS] Hey, you okay? I thought I could trust you. You can. You showed them my private account. Mom was freaking out, okay? You just took off without telling anybody. Dude, you got engaged without telling anybody. I just wanna be treated like an adult. Trust me, Zoey, you don't need to be in such a hurry. Being an adult is hard. You have to get a job, start paying rent, buying food. Oh, man. Don't tell me that after tonight, you're on his side. Can I ask you a question? Did you really want what would've happened if Dad hadn't come after you? You put yourself in a dangerous spot. Says the African queen. I heard Bridget's speech. Yeah, me too. So what, you didn't know all of that? Listen, Zoey, I, I don't want things to be weird between us, okay? Can we just start over? [♪♪♪] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [♪♪♪] [POOL BALLS CRASHING] Mr. Parston, we need to talk. Oz, believe me, I had no idea that Bridget was gonna read that list. I know, I know. Look, can I be honest? Yeah. I know you were hoping that Abby would chill here with you and be a part of your whole work thing, so you're disappointed. I understand your concerns about Kenya, trust me, but I can't think of a safer place to be than in the center of God's will. STEVE: Well, forgive me for not seeing that quite as clearly as you. OZ: I know it may seem extreme, but it is not something that we're taking lightly, which is why we have partners, which is why we're training, and which is why we're praying. And sir, with all due respect, shouldn't that be for me and Abby to decide, as husband and wife? It's clear that I am not what you had in mind for your daughter, but I am committed to her 100%, and I'd really appreciate it if you backed me. You know, it's hard enough thinking I can measure up when I'm competing with all of this. You're not gonna believe this. Believe what? Someone gave us a yacht club membership. Dad, we need to talk to you about the gifts. Do you wanna talk about what happened last night first? [DOORBELL RINGING] Uh, hang on. Good morning! Oh, hello, sleepy head. Oh, I know you had a rough night, but the schedule never sleeps. Could, could you--? Okay, okay. Just give me a moment. Okay, uh-huh. Connie! Okay, you didn't tell me you were hiding a beautiful house that's ready to be magical. Oh, look at these windows, so much light. Ooh, hello, sun! This kitchen, look at the island. I love this island. This island is waiting for a moment, so we're gonna have to bring in flowers. We're gonna have to bring in fabric, lighting. CONNIE: Crystal, Crystal. CRYSTAL: I am 10,000% sure this is gonna be fabulous. Crystal, before we get too far, we may need to make some changes. I know, isn't it amazing? We're making so many changes. I'm sorry, Daddy. CRYSTAL: There's much to do. Here we go. Hey. It's all my fault. I shouldn't have read that stuff. That dance floor goes to the left. You didn't do anything wrong. Then why is everybody so mad? I'm thinking roses along the wall. Sometimes people make choices that are not good for them. Mr. Parston, how would you feel about repainting the entire house? I'm thinking bridal veil white with an emerald forest trim. ABBY: Dad. Oh, Abby, what do you think about peacocks along the perimeter? Crystal, I think Stan is looking for you. Oh, thank you. Okay, Stan, Stan! We wanna return the gifts. What? It's nothing against your friends, it's just we don't need all of this stuff. You know, we'd rather put the money toward the mission. [LAUGHS] So that's it? Why don't we just sell the house while we're at it? Steve? No, I mean it, like, in all of this, have I heard a thank you? Thanks, Dad, for sacrificing all those years to give me a good life, for buying me a car and sending me off to college and paying for peacocks. Steve, stop. No, I'm serious. An ounce of appreciation or respect, but no, we're just gonna throw it all away. You still don't get it, do you, Dad? This isn't about you. No, you've made that very clear. Daddy, you're ruining everything. You know what? If this is how you're gonna be, I don't even want the wedding here. Abby, don't say that. No, Mom, I'm serious. We decided to wait and have it here for you guys, but it's not worth it. Come on. [DOOR SLAMS] [GLASS SMASHES] Go after her. Go after her. [♪♪♪] [CAR ENGINE WHIRRING] Ah. [♪♪♪] [SIGHS] [♪♪♪] Lord help me. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] She's still not responding. Connie, I'm sorry. I've been, I took my eye off the ball. You still reading? And thinking. Did you know Abby put together an entire fundraising plan for the orphanage? Yeah, she told me. "With your help, we can double the capacity of Nueva Vida, showing love to the least, the last, and the lost." It's amazing. She's not wasting her degree. I can see that. Zoey's asking when she can have her phone back. Something about texting friends about missing assignments. Well, let's give it back to her, but no more accounts we don't have access to. Agreed. And location stays on. And the expectation that we can check it at any time. Agreed. Hey, I love you, and I know you love the girls. I'm gonna get better at how I show them. BRIDGET: Mommy! I have to go put Bridget to bed. Hey, you know what? I got this. [♪♪♪] Oh, I've finally made it, whoa. Are you and Mom getting divorced? No, why would you say that? Jake's parents were fighting and now they're getting divorced. Honey, I'm, I'm so sorry to hear that. Mom and I disagree sometimes, but I, I love her more than anything, and you know what? She gave me the best three things of my life, Abby, Zoey, and you. [GIGGLING] Oh, no, oh, no, here comes Mr. Snake. Oh, no, who's gonna save you now, little girl? Oh, I'll rescue you, Bridget. Got him! My hero. Will you do that again? Why? Because I need it. Mm, good night. I love you, Dad. I love you, too. [♪♪♪] [STEVE SIGHS] [KNOCKING] Hi, it's Abby, leave a message. Hey Abby, I'm at the Flores Church right now. I was hoping you might be here. Went by the rectory, no one was there either. Listen, I, I'm... I really wanna talk to you. Call me back, okay? [♪♪♪] [KEYS JINGLE] What, you didn't drag Abby back home, too? Sorry I embarrassed you. Embarrassed me? You humiliated me. Yeah, I probably could have done that better, but I'm not sorry for protecting you. Zoey, I know you, you want to feel wanted, but your actions, they have consequences. I know I haven't been an expert at communicating this, but I really love you. [♪♪♪] [PHONE CHIMES] Who's that? It's Abby. "Hi Mom and Dad, I never wanted my wedding to be a source of tension between us, but I'm tired of fighting about it. Oz and I have decided to reset this whole thing and get married where we feel the most at home together." At Nueva Vida? "We decided there's no reason to wait anymore, so we're just gonna make it small and do it tomorrow. We'd still love for you to come, but if you can't accept this, we understand. Please don't hate me." Oh, Abby. Okay, get dressed, get packed. We're going now. Steve, we are not driving down to Mexico to stop their wedding. Stop it? I don't wanna miss it. [♪♪♪] STEVE: Text her again. Steve, I've texted, I've called. She's just not responding. What about Carlos and Bella? I've left three messages. [PHONE CHIMES] Are you okay? I saw your Instagram pictures. Can you not? You, you have a really good eye. How would you feel about taking my camera when we get down there? You could be the official wedding photographer. If we haven't missed it. [♪♪♪] CONNIE: Are you sure this is right? STEVE: I have no idea. CONNIE: I have no service, do you? STEVE: No, no, the GPS is not working. [CONNIE SIGHS] There! [CHILDREN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [♪♪♪] CARLOS: Steve! Oh, my goodness, you're here. I can't believe it. Did we miss it? It never started. You stopped it? I asked Abby if she really wanted to get married without her family here. She's locked herself away ever since. She's in the chapel now, but she won't talk to anyone. Oh, I'm so glad you're here. Oz, I'm so sorry. I never should have put pressure on you. Ah, thank you, but I'm the one who should apologize. She was so upset, I just, we should have never run out. Can you go talk to her? I'm the one that caused all this trouble in the first place. Sir, I don't think you realize how important you are to her. Please. [♪♪♪] [DOOR CREAKING] Abbs? Daddy? Hey. You came. Did you get our texts or our calls? No, the service here is terrible. Honey, I'm, I'm so sorry. I didn't listen to you. You were right the whole time. What? You were right. I'm, I'm not ready. I can't leave my family. What if I never see you guys again? Daddy, I'm scared. Hey, there's a guy out there that is deeply in love with you. Do you love him? More than anything. And you truly feel called to Kenya? I think so. I mean, then you started talking about the risks and now I don't know what to think. I'm, I'm sorry, I shouldn't filled your head with my fears. The truth is I couldn't bring myself to let you go. You're my little girl, but I also see that you are a brave, selfless woman that wants to change the world. I read your proposal made for Nueva Vida. It's fantastic, and with your permission, I, I'd like to show it around. I know some people. Really? Abbs, you got a gift, and now I can see that's a gift you need to share, even if it's halfway around the world. But what about the firm? What about your plans? Well, yeah, the firm will probably go under and your mom and I'll be destitute, but Bridget is cute, so she can beg for food for all of us. I'm learning to let go of my plans, and I think it's time that you and I both started trusting God with his. Dad, thank you. Let's go get you married. [♪♪♪] [CHURCH BELLS RINGING] [♪♪♪] [CEREMONIAL MUSIC PLAYS] [CAMERA CLICKS] Dearly beloved, what a day. [GUESTS LAUGHING] Who gives this woman to be married? Her mother and I do. Wait. Oz, I give you my blessing. Thanks, Dad. Please be seated. [♪♪♪] Oz, Abby, marriage isn't just between two people. It's a family affair. As you enter now into the covenant of matrimony, you reflect God's will for his people, that they should be joined with him in eternity through Christ. Please repeat after me. I, Oswaldo Christopher Flores. I, Oswaldo Christopher Flores. Take you, Abigail Joy Parston. Take you Abigail Joy Parston. To be my lawfully wedded wife. To be my lawfully wedded wife. As long as we both shall live. As long as we both shall live. CARLOS: I, Abigail Joy Parston. I, Abigail Joy Parston. Take you, Oswaldo Christopher Flores. Take you, Oswaldo Christopher Flores. To be my lawfully wedded husband. To be my lawfully wedded husband. As long as we both shall live. As long as we both shall live. And now, by the authority vested in me and in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, I pronounce you man and wife. [CARLOS SPEAKS IN SPANISH] [GUESTS CHEERING] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [UPBEAT DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] STEVE: Here we go. [LAUGHING] [OZ LAUGHING] [ABBY LAUGHING] Give me a high five, a high five. High five, high five. Hey. Hey. ZOEY: Check it out. Look at this one. She's beautiful, isn't she? That's exactly how I feel when I look at you. I'm sorry I lied to you, and about the whole-- I, I forgive you. Thanks. You forgive me too? I'm gonna go take some more pictures. [GUESTS CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [GUESTS SPEAKING IN SPANISH] Congratulations. Gracias, amigo. [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] Oh, perfecto. You read the book, didn't you? I did. Habanero cake? No, no, no, thank you. They're beautiful together, Steve. You did well. [♪♪♪] [GUESTS CHEERING] [♪♪♪] Wait. Oh, baby, oh, I love you. I love you. I love you, sis. I love you. I love you, Daddy. I always will. I love you, too. [♪♪♪] [LAUGHS] [♪♪♪] [CAR ENGINE WHIRRING] [BANGS] [GUESTS LAUGHING] [♪♪♪] [CAR ENGINE WHIRRING] [CAR HONKING] [♪♪♪] [SIGHS] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪]
