- Dalva! - Help me! ﻿Jacques! Let him go! ﻿Let me go! Dalva! ﻿You can't do this! ﻿Hold her down! ﻿Let her go! ﻿Get him outside! ﻿No! ﻿- Jacques! - Dalva! ﻿- Jacques! - Stop! ﻿- Let him go! - Let her go! ﻿- Jacques! - Dalva! ﻿- Dalva! - Let him go! ﻿Jacques! ﻿Dalva! ﻿Let me go! ﻿Hold her down! ﻿Calm down! ﻿Come on. ﻿Open the door! ﻿Open the door! ﻿Can you undress yourself? ﻿- I have to see your dress. - Not the dress. It's a gift. ﻿I'm sorry Dalva, we need it for the investigation. ﻿- What investigation? - The police are in charge of it. ﻿I don't know much more, ﻿but I promise you'll get it back. ﻿We'll lend you some other clothes in the meantime. ﻿OK? ﻿OK, you can undress behind the screen. ﻿I'm going to need to examine you. ﻿Can you lift your arms, please? ﻿Can I see under your shirt? ﻿OK, Dalva. ﻿Now I'm going to ask you to lie down on your back. ﻿Can you take off your panties? ﻿Do you know the frog position? ﻿You just have to spread your legs and put your soles together. ﻿I'm going to use a small compress to clean up. ﻿I'm just looking to see if everything is OK. ﻿Hi, Dalva. ﻿I'm Jayden. ﻿I'm a youth worker. And that's my colleague, Zora. ﻿Welcome, Dalva. ﻿This is the Givet shelter. ﻿You'll stay with us for now, OK? ﻿Don't be afraid, you're safe here. ﻿Not far from your home. You're from Bony? ﻿- She's from Bony, right? - Yes. ﻿Oh Shit. Hey! ﻿- Stop! - Wait! ﻿Stop! ﻿- Let me go! - Calm! ﻿Stop! ﻿Calm down! ﻿Calm down! ﻿- Are you OK? - Be calm! ﻿It's OK. ﻿It's so you don't wake everyone up. You'll have your room tomorrow. ﻿Here are the lockers where the kids can put their things. ﻿- The canteen, where you'll get meals... - What meals? ﻿There's a chance you'll stay here a while. ﻿What? ﻿- We had a request from the prosecutor. - Who is that? ﻿- Someone who protects your rights. - My rights? ﻿What rights? ﻿Let's continue the visit. This is the living room. ﻿You can come here between 8 AM to 10 PM. ﻿There's a TV and videogames, ﻿CDs, table football... ﻿A place where you can be with others. ﻿Let's go on? ﻿But why do I have to stay here? ﻿This is the youth workers' office where you can find us. ﻿Always knock before entering. ﻿Wait here for me. ﻿Why does the prosecutor want me to stay here? ﻿He thinks you'd be better here. ﻿Why? ﻿He thinks you might be in danger with your father. ﻿Here, your bed sheets. ﻿You're sharing a room with Samia. ﻿She's here because she got kicked out of school for a week. ﻿Hey, didn't your mum teach you to knock before entering? ﻿What the fuck, bro? ﻿I've told you to smoke outside! ﻿Guys too! ﻿- That's not in the rules. - Samia! ﻿Who is she? ﻿Her? That's Dalva, your new roommate. ﻿What? Are you serious? ﻿That's her suitcase? ﻿- Samia! - Fuck... ﻿What bullshit! ﻿Replacing Kenza with Barbie. ﻿Why is my suitcase here? ﻿The police brought your stuff. ﻿They only found these clothes ﻿- and they looked for a phone. Got one? - No. ﻿I don't want to stay here. ﻿You don't get to decide. The judge does. ﻿Meals are at 12 and 7 o'clock. ﻿OK? ﻿Hey new girl, come sit here, there's a spot for you! ﻿We're nice! We won't bite! ﻿Come here. ﻿Jayden, introduce us to her! It's been five years I'm single! ﻿- Calm down! - Hey, shut up! That's enough! ﻿Please eat quietly! ﻿You want anything? ﻿You need the energy. ﻿Where is he? ﻿- Who? - Jacques. ﻿In a hearing. ﻿- The thing with the camera? - Yeah. ﻿Except we don't film adults. ﻿Did he ask where I was? ﻿Dalva, he won't come to get you. ﻿Let's sit down. ﻿Jayden! Jayden, here! Here! ﻿Right here! Just right here! ﻿You can sit her here, please! ﻿- We told you to sit down! - Yeah! ﻿Here's OK for you? ﻿Give Dalva a warm welcome, OK? ﻿I love how you're dressed! ﻿That's a great dress! It's... it's classy! ﻿Yeah, I come from a classy family! ﻿- You've got lot of money... - Why are you here? ﻿I don't know. ﻿Liar. We all know why we're here. ﻿I'm here because my mum is a whore and she can't take care of me. ﻿And you? ﻿Your mum? ﻿So it's your father? ﻿He's never hurt me. ﻿Whose fault is it? ﻿Sheitan? ﻿You're going too far! ﻿She doesn't even know who it is! ﻿Hello. ﻿- Mr. Dorkel? - Yes. ﻿- I'm Mrs. Kouten. - It's a pleasure. ﻿Hello. ﻿I'm Leila Kouten, your lawyer. ﻿- I'm here to defend you. - Defend me from what? ﻿Do you understand why you are here? ﻿- Because you made a mistake. - No. ﻿We received a report from the neighbourhood. ﻿The prosecutor ordered an investigation. ﻿We were worried so we removed you from your father's home. ﻿Why? ﻿We've received the results of your tests. ﻿From what I have, ﻿your father is accused of parental kidnapping and incest. ﻿- You know what incest is? - He didn't do anything. ﻿Listen... ﻿- Maybe it's what he wants you to think... - But that's not us. ﻿Why? ﻿- Dalva... - Where is he? ﻿In Reims, in pre-trial detention. ﻿People who commit serious offences go there before trial. ﻿When will I see him again? ﻿Not before the trial. ﻿Dalva, wait! ﻿Dalva! ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Seeing Jacques. I want to talk to him. ﻿That's going to be tricky. ﻿But I can ask the judge for permission for you to write to him, OK? ﻿- I want to see him! I want to go home. - That's not possible! ﻿Stop! ﻿Stop! ﻿Are you out of your mind? ﻿Move! ﻿Hey, young lady! ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Come back! ﻿- Young lady! - That's forbidden! ﻿Stop! ﻿Where were you going? ﻿Where? ﻿Answer me! ﻿Reims. ﻿Did you really think you can see someone in jail like that? ﻿You ring the bell and they'll let you in? ﻿Stop running away like that. ﻿Look, apart from the shelter, you've got nowhere to go. ﻿Dalva? ﻿Please come in. ﻿I'd like you to understand ﻿what's going on with you and your feelings. ﻿Who said a father and daughter can't love each other? ﻿Well, it's a bit more complicated than that. ﻿A father and daughter can share mutual affection, but... ﻿they can't share sexuality... ﻿And if a father does that to protect her? ﻿- From whom? - From others. Those who don't know how. ﻿To do what? ﻿Love. ﻿Dalva, is there a difference between loving and making love for you? ﻿No, when a woman loves, she must know how to make love. ﻿Look at her dress! ﻿She looks like my grandma from back in the day! ﻿That's too much! ﻿Like, what year it is? ﻿And those old earrings! ﻿Hey Dalva, going to a gala? ﻿It's OK if she wants to be a lady! ﻿Cut it out! ﻿- Put your make-up on. - Mind your own business! ﻿Make an effort, seriously... ﻿Can I use your lipstick, please? ﻿Yeah, go ahead. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Look at her gross lipstick. ﻿Where is Dalva? ﻿Jayden's been looking for her for ten minutes! ﻿So she has a driver too? ﻿Sorry, miss, ﻿but you can't go to school like that. ﻿- Why not? - Dress how you want at the shelter, ﻿but for school... it's not the same. ﻿- Do you have any advice for me? - Yes. ﻿I've got plenty of advice! ﻿Do you see how you dress? ﻿Look how Barbie is rebelling! ﻿That's enough! Get her something from your room. ﻿Like what? I'll never give that whore a thing! ﻿Hurry up, we're short on time! ﻿Come on, we don't have time! ﻿That's a nice jacket. ﻿Do you have any taste? ﻿That's not the point, a girl your age doesn't dress like that, that's all. ﻿I'm not a girl. ﻿I'm a woman. ﻿No. ﻿You're not a woman yet, Dalva. ﻿You are a young girl. ﻿- She's fresh isn't she? - Chill, man. Don't go there! ﻿She's nice! ﻿Silence, please! ﻿There is someone who'd like to introduce herself. ﻿You can tell us where you are from and what your name is. ﻿Dalva Keller. I live in Bony. ﻿What a damn liar! ﻿You live at the Givet shelter. ﻿Samia, don't start! That's Dalva's business. ﻿No, it's not! ﻿- She's been talking shit to everyone! - OK, that's enough! Get out! ﻿Lucile! ﻿Do you want to join Samia? ﻿No, sir. ﻿Take a seat. ﻿All right. ﻿I told you we'd talk about the Pythagorean theorem today. ﻿I don't think anyone knows it? ﻿Of course not. ﻿Hey wait, Dalva! ﻿Dalva, wait! ﻿Do you live in Bony? ﻿I'm from there but I've never seen you. ﻿- I just moved away from there. - Really? ﻿Where did you live before that? ﻿- You don't know anymore? - No, I don't. ﻿We move all the time. ﻿Didn't you live in La Havetière? ﻿Heard what happened there? ﻿Stop with that already! ﻿Well, actually... ﻿there was a guy who was arrested not long ago ﻿for hiding and raping his daughter ﻿Some people are crazy. ﻿What the fuck! ﻿I lend you my clothes and you do this? ﻿You couldn't be careful? ﻿You know how hard I worked to pay for this? ﻿I'm sorry... ﻿It's the first time that... ﻿She thinks she's a woman but she's just a baby. ﻿Here's a diaper. I had mine too when I was brought in. ﻿I spoke to your mother on the phone. ﻿We had a long talk. ﻿Did you know she'd filed a complaint for kidnapping? ﻿You're lying. She's the one who left! ﻿Do you remember that? ﻿He cried all the time. ﻿And after she left, did you try to contact her? ﻿What for? She didn't love us anymore! ﻿Dalva, we think it would be good for you to see her again. ﻿But it's not her I want to see. ﻿It's him. ﻿And this? Ain't it cool? ﻿Do you really want me to wear that? ﻿What? ﻿It's what's in! ﻿So? ﻿You have to be in! ﻿To make you happy? ﻿Look, we've got 15 minutes to spend 100 bucks. ﻿We're not leaving empty-handed. ﻿This. Yes or no? ﻿What do I get if I wear that? ﻿What? ﻿Tell the judge I must see my dad and I'll wear it. ﻿You think you can buy me off? ﻿OK, you've got 15 minutes. See you at the till. ﻿Wait! ﻿What? ﻿I've never done this on my own... ﻿You've never shopped before? ﻿Never picked out your clothes? ﻿I don't know... ﻿Look first and then... Do you have a favourite colour? ﻿- You don't have a favourite colour? - No. ﻿Come on! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss ﻿Don't worry! ﻿It was the same for Léa, except that it was her uncle. ﻿The guy raped her for a year! ﻿Then something crazy happened! ﻿She started to get huge bumps all over her body ﻿and eczema spots on her arms, belly and thighs... ﻿How did it end? ﻿Her mum found out! ﻿Poor thing! What shame for the girl! ﻿Yeah, and then the fucking uncle ﻿- ended up in a psych ward. - Not prison? ﻿My mum said pedophiles don't deserve prison. They deserve the death penalty! ﻿Are you OK, Dalva? ﻿Wait, come back! ﻿Why did you say that? ﻿Come back! ﻿Shut the fuck up! ﻿Why do you tell these girls about your life? ﻿Don't tell anyone anything at school. ﻿No one can understand. ﻿- I didn't say anything. - Right. ﻿It's because of you they know I'm at the shelter. ﻿And they say my father is a pedophile. ﻿And? ﻿Isn't that the truth? ﻿School and the shelter aren't the same! At the shelter, you can talk. ﻿We don't give a shit what happened to you. We're all scum! ﻿We're not like them, and we will never be! ﻿Samia, come on! We're gonna be late! ﻿I'm ready! Fucking hell! ﻿What's wrong with that fat bitch? ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Pissed your bed? ﻿It's OK, don't worry! ﻿Samia, I've had it with you! It's my last warning! ﻿You're staying? ﻿Hello, darling. ﻿You've grown so much... ﻿That's not my mother. ﻿Listen, ﻿seeing each other after all these years ﻿is difficult, isn't it? ﻿What does she want from me? ﻿I've come to find you... ﻿You think you can just come back? ﻿But I didn't leave! ﻿- Yes, you did! - No. ﻿I left your father, ﻿because he was suffocating... ﻿We were going to have joint custody... ﻿but he left with you! ﻿I looked for you everywhere. ﻿You were five. ﻿Why didn't you find me then? ﻿He moved all the time. ﻿I never stopped thinking about you! ﻿I thought I was going mad! ﻿- If I'd known that... - If you had known what? ﻿That he would abuse you... ﻿- No! - Dalva, stop! ﻿- Stop! - Let her go! ﻿- Calm down! - Let go of me! ﻿- Dalva! - Wait! ﻿Dalva! ﻿What are you doing? Open this door right now ﻿Dalva, stop! ﻿Dalva? ﻿When will you stop hurting yourself? ﻿When I see him. ﻿Tell me, I want the gossip! ﻿You're a radio. You talk a lot. ﻿No, Medhi, please! ﻿Don't worry! ﻿Dalva, ﻿what is this? ﻿How long will your blackmailing last? ﻿Jayden... ﻿It's crazy. You're really freaking them out! ﻿Are you going to go and see? ﻿Shut up, he's coming! ﻿Terminator! ﻿What's this all about? ﻿If this goes on, we'll have you hospitalized! ﻿Is that what you want? ﻿You don't decide. The judge does. ﻿- He won't see us anymore. - I had him on the phone yesterday ﻿He's coming. ﻿Please come in. ﻿Let's go. ﻿Shall we sit? ﻿What's that? ﻿That? ﻿It's nothing. ﻿I cut myself shaving. ﻿They give us disposable razors. It's atrocious! ﻿Fortunately, I only shave for you. ﻿You look beautiful. ﻿I've tried. ﻿So have I. ﻿But here, I'm not allowed to iron my shirts. ﻿Me neither. ﻿At the shelter, they say a girl my age doesn't dress like this. ﻿I don't care what they say. I don't believe them. ﻿I told them you didn't do anything to me, that you never forced me, ﻿but nobody listens to me. ﻿They say that with you, I'm in danger, ﻿that what we did is forbidden, ﻿that you know it, that you told them... ﻿I don't believe them. I just pretend. I promise. ﻿But... ﻿Even at school... ﻿They say you're a pedophile. ﻿It's true... ﻿What? ﻿Why do you say that? ﻿What they say is true... ﻿No contact! ﻿Sit back down, please. ﻿Sit down. ﻿Back to the anteroom. We'll come and get you. ﻿Dalva. ﻿Samia told me you were here. ﻿How are you feeling? ﻿Do you want me to leave you alone? ﻿This is all because of you. ﻿What are you talking about? ﻿You told him the same things you told me, ﻿but he believed you. ﻿What things? ﻿That what we were doing was wrong. ﻿Why do you say "we"? ﻿He taught you to do that. ﻿I never said no. ﻿There's a difference ﻿- between... - I don't care. ﻿Now it's too late. ﻿Because of you, he doesn't love me anymore. ﻿I don't think that's true. ﻿What if your father had admitted what he did ﻿because he loves you? ﻿It’s because we weren't alone that he said that. ﻿And if it had been just the two of you... ﻿and he'd told you that? ﻿I'm sorry! ﻿It's a joke! There's no fire! ﻿I just wanted you to come out. ﻿You want to smoke? ﻿Try it. It will do you good. ﻿Why? ﻿I don't know. It helps pass the time. ﻿When my mother made rounds, ﻿I used to sit in my room ﻿and I knew a round was three cigarettes. ﻿Try it! ﻿I can't. ﻿Whatchu mean, you can't? You've got cancer? ﻿It's vulgar. ﻿What's vulgar? To smoke? ﻿It's vulgar for women. ﻿Who told you that? ﻿Was it your dad again? ﻿Don't you want to tell him to fuck off? ﻿Hasn't he lied to you enough? ﻿Don't worry, it's the first time. It gets better later. ﻿You're so sensitive! ﻿Don't worry. ﻿It's the cigarette. They put a lot of shit inside them. ﻿That's what makes your eyes sting. ﻿Straighten it out ﻿and put it in. ﻿Pack in some tobacco and then push it in. ﻿It stinks. ﻿- Hi Dalva! How are you? - Hi! ﻿Where have you been? ﻿Mind your own business, bitch! ﻿I was sick. ﻿Like being a pittbull? ﻿I'm fine now. I got better. ﻿And how are you guys? ﻿- Wow, your hair has really grown! - Yeah, really! ﻿And isn't that your real colour? ﻿I like hair roots done like that! ﻿- Do you colour your hair? - Yes. ﻿On your own? ﻿No, at the hairdresser's. ﻿Often? ﻿We used to go once a month. ﻿Isn't your hair fried? ﻿She only did the roots. ﻿- How old were you when you started? - Nine. ﻿- Seriously? - No! ﻿Yes! ﻿Go! Go! Go! Go! ﻿Dalva! ﻿Come! ﻿Lucile! Lucile! ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Let's go! ﻿What do you want with them? ﻿Come back! Fuck... ﻿Can I play? ﻿Sure! ﻿There's space here! ﻿Shut up! ﻿Yeah, there's space here! ﻿Shut up! ﻿You can't talk like that! ﻿You want to play too, pittbull? ﻿Careful what you say! ﻿Move! ﻿- Come on, play! - Dalva? ﻿Truth or dare? ﻿You've never played? ﻿Basically, you need to choose. ﻿Either you choose "truth" and she'll ask you a question, ﻿or "action" and you do something like... "kiss me". ﻿Truth. ﻿Have you sucked off your dad? ﻿- Lucile! - Shut the fuck up! Why do you say that? ﻿Lucile, shut up! ﻿She said "truth" so I asked a question! ﻿That's not a question! ﻿Then what kind of questions? ﻿Just shut your mouth! And don't say that! ﻿Stop! ﻿Stop! ﻿Stop it, Dalva! ﻿I don't understand why we don't send these children to a specialized centre. ﻿It's always the same. ﻿And when do you plan on putting them back into "your" society? ﻿I'm telling you we are not equipped to face problems like those of Dalva! ﻿I can see that. ﻿Do you realise how serious your actions are? ﻿It'll be a fucking mission to find you a school. ﻿What am I going to do with you? ﻿Fucking up her office! ﻿You should have got the PC! ﻿Why didn't you break the PC? ﻿You pick it up and smash it! ﻿Next time! ﻿She's a natural beast! ﻿Come on! Die! Die! ﻿Yes! ﻿Come on! ﻿Damn, that's bad! ﻿Wait! Go back! ﻿She really had it coming! ﻿Oh my Oh my God, she got whacked! ﻿Wow! I'm blown away ﻿Here, take this! ﻿Respect! Here's to celebrate! ﻿Come on, take it! ﻿Come on, drink! ﻿- Come on drink! - Respect! ﻿You deserve it! ﻿What are you doing? Thief! Someone, get the bottle! ﻿- Come on, give that to me! - I just want a slip! ﻿Just a little sip! ﻿Lou! ﻿Lou! ﻿Hold on, I'll copy her! ﻿Stop! ﻿Even when you're drunk, you act like a lady! ﻿I'm just kidding! For real, I like the way you are! ﻿Then teach me! ﻿What? ﻿I don't know, to walk normally. ﻿- Like... me? - Yeah. ﻿OK, so... ﻿Put your hands in your pockets. ﻿I don't have pockets. ﻿Here. ﻿Good. Then look straight ahead. ﻿And relax a little! ﻿Look ahead. ﻿Don't smile! ﻿You walk and no one should want to talk to you! ﻿Cut it out, I don't walk like that! ﻿It's not even funny! ﻿Hey guys! Look! ﻿I know it! ﻿Look! Look! ﻿Three, two, one, and... ﻿Oh no. ﻿Shit. ﻿Why is she laughing? ﻿What is she doing? ﻿Dalva. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Hello? ﻿I'm here to eat with you. ﻿That's not possible. ﻿Why can't I? ﻿What's the problem? ﻿Am I just a kid? ﻿Have you been drinking? ﻿Were you drinking, Dalva? ﻿I think it's a stupid rule. ﻿We'll talk about it tomorrow. Now it's time for bed. ﻿We'll talk about it tomorrow. Get up! ﻿Samia! ﻿It's OK. ﻿Please... ﻿Come on. ﻿Good night. ﻿All right! ﻿- One - Null. For me! ﻿- Samia! - I'm so good! ﻿Do you hear me? ﻿- Samia! - Come on... ﻿Sweetie, it's important that we have this discussion! ﻿Come on! ﻿Things have been confirmed. Your aunt called. It's good for you... ﻿She's very happy to take you in, you hear me? ﻿But I didn't ask for anything! ﻿Things have been clear from the start. You are just passing through here. ﻿So you give me two weeks before putting me on the street? ﻿- We aren't putting you on the street. - It's the same as going to my aunt's! ﻿- No, it's not. - She's like my mum! ﻿No she's not! She's taken responsibility for you and for us. ﻿She's only doing it for the money! ﻿Just because she'll get money doesn't mean she's not interested. ﻿Do you know her? Do you know her? ﻿You saw her for two hours and now you trust her? ﻿All right, look! We're stopping this discussion, ﻿and we'll resume it when you're able to. ﻿You can all go fuck yourselves! ﻿Is Monthermè far from here? ﻿You have to take the bus. ﻿You can come once the youth workers trust you enough. ﻿Will your aunt be OK with it? ﻿Don't give a fuck about her. She'll never be there. ﻿You're lucky your mum wants you back. ﻿What if it's just for the money? ﻿Are you insane? Your parents get nothing if they take you back. ﻿They won't get paid to raise their own children. ﻿And if I don't want to see my mum again? ﻿Are you serious? ﻿What do you have against her? ﻿What does she do for a living? ﻿I don't know. ﻿Does she have kids? ﻿I don't know. ﻿Future tense, "I will come". ﻿Conditional present tense. ﻿"The problem is not with other people, ﻿change the person if you have a doubt." ﻿Damn it, I don't get it at all. ﻿My dad was a better teacher. ﻿Yeah, but I'm not your father. I'm your youth worker. ﻿And what am I to you ﻿You? ﻿A young person under the protection of the Youth Care Agency. ﻿Come on, figure it out yourself! ﻿What's the answer? A, B or C? ﻿Come on, you usually get it all correct! ﻿That stinks! ﻿Don't blink. ﻿- Done? - Yes. ﻿Yuck! ﻿- You don't like it? - No, it's ugly! ﻿That's gross! ﻿Why? ﻿I look like my mum! ﻿- It has nothing to do with that! - What? ﻿You and your mum. ﻿You are not the same. ﻿- What are you doing? - Isn't it obvious? ﻿Why? What do you care? ﻿Why did you do this to me? ﻿What's that? ﻿A gift. ﻿For what? ﻿To say "thank you". ﻿Forget it, I don't want to go. ﻿Yes, you do! It's going to be great! ﻿Come! ﻿Wow! Look! ﻿Hey guys! Girls! ﻿What? ﻿All right, get over it! ﻿Well, you've just amazed us. ﻿Open the present? ﻿Now with those trainers, you can run away from your aunt's! ﻿Sparkling apple juice for everyone! ﻿Hey buddy! Let's keep it decent! ﻿What? You've got a problem? ﻿- Go and play somewhere else! - Are you jealous? ﻿- You don't mess around with her! - I'm going to break his face! ﻿- I'm gonna fuck him up! - Don't talk to him like that! ﻿- I didn't do anything! - Go outside! ﻿- I did nothing! - That's enough! ﻿It's OK! Let's keep dancing! ﻿- Why did you leave? - Leave me alone, please! ﻿- No, I won't. What's up with you? - What? ﻿I have to explain how you ruined my night? ﻿I did nothing! It was Chérif! ﻿What the fuck? Was your ass moving by itself? ﻿Why were you acting like a whore? ﻿I'm not a whore! ﻿You are a whore! That's all what you're dad taught you! ﻿Shall I take you home? ﻿No, thanks. ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿Go to bed. ﻿What do you want? ﻿I'm scared. ﻿Scared of what? ﻿Of being alone... ﻿Of never being important to anyone again. ﻿Come here. ﻿It'll be OK. ﻿Stop! Don't touch me! ﻿Hello. ﻿Who is it? ﻿Hello, my name is Dalva Keller. ﻿I was your neighbour. ﻿Did you hurt yourself? ﻿Yes. ﻿Hello Madam, I'm Jayden. I'm here to pick up Dalva. ﻿- Yes, come in. - Thank you. ﻿The girls are up there. ﻿Good thing you called. ﻿Here. ﻿A gift. ﻿Don't move, I'll get you a mirror. ﻿Do you think she'll like it? ﻿You look very pretty. ﻿It reminds me of when you were little. ﻿You know I... I have pictures ﻿on my phone. ﻿Do you want to see them? ﻿Look. ﻿- Do you remember? - Yes. ﻿It was... on the hammock in the garden. ﻿And I fell asleep. ﻿I still have that hammock. ﻿And do you have children? ﻿Yes. ﻿You have a little brother. ﻿He's two. ﻿His name is Léo. ﻿I've got some photos of him too. ﻿Look. Here. ﻿Do you have a husband? ﻿We're not married, but I have a partner ﻿His name is Vincent. ﻿And we both live together... I mean all three of us. ﻿And you? Do you have any friends? ﻿- I have a best friend. - A best friend? ﻿What's her name? ﻿Samia. ﻿That's a pretty name! ﻿But she doesn't live here anymore. ﻿But I'll go and see her. ﻿That's great. ﻿She wanted to know what your job was. ﻿Well, right now, I'm working in a restaurant. ﻿I'm a waitress. ﻿But in September, I'm going back to school ﻿to become a caregiver. ﻿Do you know what you want to do later? ﻿I don't know. ﻿I've never thought about it. ﻿If you want, we can think about it the next time we are together. ﻿Dalva! ﻿Please all rise! ﻿You may sit down. ﻿The Court will examine the case ﻿in which Mr. Jacques Keller is the accused.
