Good evening ladies and gentlemen. This is John Nesbitt speaking from historic Manhattan Hall. Members of the orchestra have taken their places on the stage .. And the great auditorium is rapidly filling. This is certainly a brilliant assemblage. If there is a great feeling of anticipation here tonight .. There is little reason to wonder why. For the orchestra, as you know .. Will be under the direction of the world-famous American conductor .. Our own John Meredith. It was to Russia in 1941 that fate sent John Meredith. It was in Russia the he heard and saw and felt and suffered .. The appalling horrors of the Nazi invasion. It was in Russia. That John Meredith remained during the long, terrifying months that followed. One may expect then, that tonight .. He will bring a new brilliance, an even deeper understanding. To the works of the great Russian composers. For as he lifts the baton. His thoughts must inevitably be carried back .. To his own intense and dramatic experiences. In the heart of fighting Russia. Ladies and gentlemen, the lights are dimming. And now Mister Meredith is making his way to the conductor's stand. And presently we shall hear our national anthem. Her at the Dynamo Airport in Moscow excitement has reached a high pitch. The plane bringing John Meredith the famous American conductor has landed. Mister Meredith. How do you do? We are so happy. My name is Petrov. I am a member of the Central Art Committee of the government. On behalf of our 190 million citizens. I welcome you, John Meredith. To Moscow and to our country. Henry Higgins. Yes. And many greeting also to your manager. Mister Henry Higgins. We want to tell you that although the sky is overcast. To us it is a proud and a beautiful day .. That you Mister John Meredith, one of the greatest conductors of our time. Has come here. To share the brilliance of your music with us. This fills our hearts with warmth and gratitude. All hail. The cultural achievements of our free people. Mister Meredith, may I speak to you? Mister Meredith, what are your impressions of Moscow? Mister Meredith, have you any statement for Pravda, please? Please. Please, quiet. Just for one minute. Mister Meredith, would you like to be interviewed? He is tired. Tell him you'll talk to them in the language of music. Yes, yes. Mister Meredith will talk to you later. Mister Meredith. I must talk to you. It is very important. Gentlemen, I think we should take it just a little faster. Right, let's try it from letter G. Our people will love him. Well, love won't get him through a schedule like that, I'll tell you. Alright gentlemen. Thank you very much. We'll meet in the morning at 8 o'clock. Meanwhile look over the piano concerto. Goodnight. Is there anything you would like me to take care of Mister Meredith? Would you like me to show you Moscow? Thank you very much, Miss Orlova. Perhaps some other time. Well Mister Meredith, everything is arranged. We have reached a compromise. We have agreed to cancel 17 of the concerts leaving a total of only 38. And no lectures. Yes, we have also agreed to cancel 8 lectures. It is a pity. - What do you think? Now, is everything alright, Mister Meredith? Exploitation. What? You want us to reduce it further? No, it's alright. You are wonderful. Who are you? I want to talk to you. 0kay. You said you wanted to talk to me. Alright. Talk. Since you arrived at the airport. I've been trying to reach you. I followed you all over Moscow. Finally. Now when I am face to face with you .. I don't know where to start. You wanted me to hear you play the piano? Isn't that it? Oh no. Not for my own sake. Only as a way to attract your attention. I had heard that .. In America they liked people who use bold and ingenious methods. To capture someone's interest. Well, you certainly captured my interest alright. Do you realize how good you are? Where do you come from? Where did you study? I come from a little village. Tschaikowskoye. It is name in honor of our great composer. We have there a very fine school of music. Every August after the harvest is completed. We have there a musical festival. That is what I came to Moscow to see you about. I'm very glad that you have a festival in Tschaikowskoye. I'm very glad you came to Moscow. Mister Meredith. Would it be possible for you to be our guest of honor? Did you ask the Central Art Committee? They're in charge of all my appearances. Yes, we did. Professor Meschkov asked for you when he heard you were coming to our country. And .. Who is Meschkov? He is the head of our school. He asked for you but the Central Art Committee said no. Meschkov was heartbroken and all of the students. So, I told them that. I will travel to Moscow and invite you personally. Oh, I see. Will you come? You make it very appealing. Please .. say yes. Let's talk about this later. Do you know any good place around here where we could have dinner? But you haven't answered my question yet. I am starved. You must be too. You must introduce me to all the most famous Russian dishes. But I have to send word to Professor Meschkov. I hate to eat alone. I get to talking to myself, and I get on my nerves. I know. But I must have an answer, please. Good evening, Mister Meredith. - Hello. Right this way please. That's John Meredith. Mister Meredith. Could I have your autograph please? Certainly. Thank you so much. Would you care to order now, Mister Meredith? Why don't you order for both of us, huh. But I don't know what you would like. - Anything. Everything you say. Are you really very hungry? - I'm starved. Alright. We would like some Zakuskis .. Borsch Peroski Lucasina. And beef Stroganoff, cutlet Jarski, and Chachlick Kanjai, please. Anything else? Yes. Perok and Marjony. Now I know I'm in Russia. I can't get over it. What? Well everybody seems to be having such a good time. Well, is that wrong? No except that I always thought that Russians were sad .. Melancholy people. You know, sitting around brooding about their souls. This is such a surprise. You are a surprise too. I am? If I didn't know that I'd met you in Moscow, you .. You might be an American girl. An American? - Yes. But I've never even met an American before. You mean I'm the first one? - Yes. Well. What's your name? Nadya Ivanov Stepanova. I beg your pardon? Nadya Ivanov Stepanova. Wait. You must have a shorter name that that. Do people go round calling you that all the time? No Mister Meredith. They call me Nadya. They call me John. Will you come to Tschaikowskoye? John. Let me talk to my business manager. I'll see if we can arrange it. Meanwhile, what would you say if I asked you to show me Moscow? I? Yes. You know, in the interest of Russian/American friendship. I don't know Moscow. This is my first visit here. Alright. I'll tell you what. I'll show you Moscow. I'll make a deal with you. - What kind? Give me a chance to catch my breath and I'll tell you some good news. Good. Well, it's all arranged. I'm coming to your village in August. What's the matter? Isn't that what you wanted? Yes .. yes, very much. Only .. I feel guilty. Guilty about what? You are coming because of me. Certainly. I feel that I owe it to you for making this interlude in Moscow so charming. Yes .. it has been charming, hasn't it. I suppose for a famous man. Each new country he visits has a charm all its own. You speak of my fame as though it were a barbed-wire fence between us. I thought with you I'd escaped all that. Is fame then like a prison? Something to escape from? When it separates us, yes. John. Tell me more about yourself. What made you come here? - To Russia? I've adored your music since I first heard Tchaikovsky's symphony path?tique. I remember the concert well. I was fourteen years old. I'd never heard his music before and .. I don't know. It did something to me way down inside. I closed my eyes and tried to imagine the land and the .. People from which such sad and beautiful music came. I decided if I ever had the opportunity I would go and see for myself. And did you find everything as you imagined it? Oh yes. Even more. I found you. You've been wonderful, Nadya. I don't know how I'll ever be able to leave. You may have to leave sooner than you think. You will be running out of American cigarettes. I do smoke too much, don't I. I'm always threatening to give it up. Oh no. Smoke a pipe. It would become you. If only for your Russian interlude. Have you your breath back now? Now we can go and dance. If you want to. If I want to? Come on. [ Singing: ] "When I was very young." "I gave my heart away." "Her cheeks were all like cherry trees that bloom in May." "Her eyes were stars that lit the darkness with a sliver flame." "And she is still my love." "And Russia is her name." "She stood beside my plow." "She kissed away my tears." "And warmed my empty hands throughout the empty years." "And when she smiled .." "The heartbreak vanished and the day break came." "And she is still my own." "And Russia is her name." "I heard her sing." "I heard her sing for me." "And there was love." "A love that set my hungry heart aflame." "And now that love is mine." "And Russia is her name." Confidentially I was assured this is the most romantic spot in the whole city. Is that why you brought me here? Why certainly. You see. In Russia, I feel a little .. Handicapped. Out of my element, so to speak. No, you are doing very well. If we were in America and I were asked to describe you, I'd say .. What a girl. That would be very nice to hear. Even in Moscow. No. No. In Moscow I feel I should say it differently. For instance, I'd ask .. Where did you get that light in your eyes? Or, where did you get that voice that makes me think .. Words are music. That's very good. Go on. No, no. You're not being fair. You see I can't really describe you unless you tell me more about yourself. But .. what do you want me to tell you? I'm just an ordinary Russian girl from a little village. Who should have stayed there if she had any sense. Why, don't you like Moscow? Yes. I like it very much. It must be me. I'm afraid it is both. We have known each other only four days. What are you talking about? We've known each other for ever. I love you, Nadya. Forever. I love you. These are very convenient words. They mean different things to different people. Look, darling. I don't know the words. I don't care about them. "I love you" means I want you and I'm crazy about you. "Forever" means .. It means now and all the years I've wasted without you. And all the years we'll be together. No, John. What do you mean "no"? I'm the guy it happened to. I haven't been able to think of anything else since I first saw you. You are in the music as I rehearse it. In everything I see and feel. And you feel the same way about me. I can see it in the way you look at me. And I can see it in the way you refuse to look at me. No, John. Please, no. - Why not? Tell me. It is not practical. We are being. Unrealistic. Sentimental. Isn't that the way to be? Sentimental? Perhaps. Unrealistic. We can never. Nadya. We have serious differences. Socially. Culturally. We have not even discussed .. - We will discuss them tomorrow. Or the day after. But .. - Nadya, I love you. I will never let you go. Nadya. Nadya! Nadya! Father. Stop the tractor. Stop it. Father. Nadya. Nadya. Nadya, he is coming. He sent a telegram. His train will be here at three. Meschkov wants you to come to the station immediately. Who is coming? - John Meredith. We are all going to welcome him and I'm going to lead my band. Why do you sit there, Nadya? Don't you understand what Peter is saying? Yes father, I understand. Well get down and go with Peter. Father, I think it would be better if Professor Meschkov received him. I would rather see him later. Then I will go. Someone from our family should be there to do him honor. Oh .. don't cry, Golubchik. I'll be right back. You'll see. Before you know it. Come on my son, come. Come. Where is Nadya? What is the matter? Nadya said she wouldn't come. - What? I am to represent her. I think it is terrible that Nadya isn't here. But she must. Now Meschkov, the girl is working like a horse. She is busy. She is busy, but you have time. Mister Meredith. I am Alexander Meschkov. - How do you do, sir? I cannot express to you how .. How honored I am .. Vanya. Let me take these. These are my students. All prodigies. This is Faber. Professor of harmony. Also a prodigy. A great honor. I was looking forward to it with great anticipation. This is Karklev. Professor of history of music. Also a prodigy. I'm very glad to meet you, Mister Meredith. And this is Ivan Stepanov. He is not a prodigy. Nadya's father? - Yes. The same. Very glad to know you, sir. Mister Meredith. On behalf of the Tschaikowskoye Music School and .. Of the entire student body, I welcome you. Here, culture is always .. Here .. cult .. Here, with the music of all the world. I forgot. Don't you worry about it. I heard all the speeches in Moscow. Nevertheless, I have to say, something. Not a speech. Just a few words. On behalf of my daughter Nadya Stepanova and my whole family. Including my other daughter Anna, her husband Maxim .. And my little granddaughter Stasha. I invite you while you are here to live at our house. Thank you very much. We have already arranged for Mister Meredith to stay at my house. Who persuaded him to come here? You or Nadya? But he's the guest of the entire school. - But Nadya is the president. Stepanov, I accept your invitation with pleasure. The pleasure is mine. And that's a fact. Pardon me, Mister Meredith. My name is Yanovich. How do you do. I want to ask you, Mister Meredith .. - Not now. Later. Later. This way please, Mister Meredith. Thank you. We didn't expect you, Mister Meredith. Nadya told us that you might come in August for the festival. But we had no idea that you would suddenly pop up in the middle of May. May, June, July, August. John Meredith is always welcome. I remember my speech now, Mister Meredith. Never mind. Never mind. Don't bother him. Hiya, kids. - Hi. - Hi. Now look here, Louis, please don't bother him. I'm not bothering. I only want to ask a question. I want to ask him now. Wait a second. Don't push me. Alright, wait a second. Who is she, Peter? - She is my sister, Sonia. We live next door. My name is Stasha Bulganov. Old man Stepanov's granddaughter. Then Nadya should be your auntie, yes? - Yes. Time to come home, children. - Mama, it is John Meredith. He is going to stay here father, with the Stepanovs. Mister Meredith. This is our mother and father. Boris and Natasha Bulganov. How do you do. Have our children been driving you crazy? No, not at all. They are fine kids. We like them too but they drive us crazy. Oh, it is not true. We grow many fine things in our country but the finest crop of all is this. We have to go now. - Alright. We'll come back later. - Goodbye. Here is your watch. - Thank you, Peter. It's a fine watch. - I'm glad you like it. They are coming home now. My mummy and my auntie Nadya too. Anna. Hello, Nadya. Sorry I couldn't leave my work to meet you at the station, Mister Meredith. This is a very busy time of year for us. So I see. I understand you've been out driving a tractor. We did not expect you so .. I did not expect you quite so soon. Your father insisted I must stay in your house. We will try to make your stay very enjoyable. I like him, Nadya. I like you too, Stasha. But I must be careful not to like you too much. Otherwise you might run off and leave me someday without any reason. See you at dinner, Mister Meredith. Stasha. In my country that's known as a brush-off. Come on. We can see him through the window. But maybe we shouldn't, Peter. - Shush, I just want to look at him. Maybe someday he'll let me be his pupil. So Mister Meredith, here you are at a simple peasant farm table. Where we have nothing to offer you but our company. And the country food we eat ourselves. It's wonderful to be in the middle of a family again. Mister Meredith, what does it mean, "a brush-off"? You'd better ask your aunt Nadya about that. Say, this food is wonderful. Who cooked all these delicious things? Who else could cook for you but Nadya? Did you cook this dinner? I did. But you are a pianist. How can you let her do such work? How can I let her? The question is how can I stop her. I would not be happy here on the farm if I did not do my share of the work. No. But is it necessary that you drive a tractor? It is a privilege to drive the tractor. Our tractor, my Golubchik, is a beauty. Wait until I show it to you. Father, Mister Meredith is a musician. Such things are of no interest to him. What do you mean, of no interest? I was born and raised on a farm. You were raised on a farm? You did not tell me this. There are lots of things I haven't told you. But I will. What kind of a farm was it? Was it big? How good was the soil? Not so big. About forty acres. Soil was good. We had a tractor too but we did not call it Golubchik. We called it .. "Big John". How long did you live there? - Until I finished college. What was your crop? Wheat. - Wheat? Nadya, did you hear that? A farmer comes to see us and we don't even show him our farm. The man raises wheat and we don't even show him our grain. Come. You've never seen anything like it. The kernels are as big as grapes. That's a fact. Not big grapes, you understand. Little grapes. And that's a fact. He should have taught you a little politeness. Or the courage to face your problems without running away. Just look at that. And now tell me the truth. Have you ever seen anything like this? What did I tell you. - It's beautiful. What variety is it? What variety? Ordinary grain. That's wonderful. It really is. What did I tell you? And now I'll show you the farm itself. Father .. at night? With this grain, night-time is alright. Also, you have to see the tractor. Here she is. Golubchik. She has changed our lives. Mister Meredith. - Father. Leave them alone. I want you to answer my question. Why did you run away? I left because .. I didn't feel our .. Our relationship held any promise for the future. Why, that's a lot of nonsense. I love you and you love me. You are a wonderful man. You believe that a declaration of love overcomes all obstacles? I do not. - You do. To every problem I posed in Moscow your only answer was .. "But I love you". - But I love you. You believe only in emotion. Perhaps that's why you conduct so well Tchaikovsky. What do you believe in? I believe that reason and emotion cannot be separated. I believe that .. That we must face the obstacles between us realistically. And that's why you ran away? Yes. That night when I sat in the box. I watched you conduct. I realised there were a thousand miles between us. That .. I had made a mistake in forcing my way into your life. And that the only way to correct that mistake was .. Was to go away. And never see you again. But didn't you care what that would do to me? After you left, I couldn't go ahead with my tour. No, John. Your work should be important. What there was between us was .. Was only for the moment. Not to me, Nadya. You've become the most important thing in my life. I want you to marry me. Is that why you came down here? Yes. I've wanted to marry you from the very beginning. John. If I tried to explain to you. What I am thinking. Will you promise not to interrupt .. And say "but I love you"? It's kind of tough, but I promise. I have a great responsibility. To my family and to my village. To the way which I have lived. And. I don't quite see how I can build a life with you and .. And then also help to build a better and better life for my country. Oh, I see. But I love you. And I don't quite see how anything so beautiful could hurt my country. So, what I should like is .. Is a little time in which to think it over. And perhaps to discuss it with my family. Of course. Sure. So you don't like the way I conduct Tchaikovsky, huh? 0kay, so your name is Yanovich. Where is John Meredith? That's what I must know. I am taking you. I am taking you. That's a short-cut. See that little mound over there. That's their little house. What is going on here, Peter? - Civilian defence. Does everybody do this? - Everybody. Everybody except me. I'm too young. Commence firing! Cease firing! Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. Morning. - Want to try? Sure. Did you speak to your family? Keep your eye on the gun. Put your thumbs on the trigger, so. - Yep. What's this thing down here? - The wheel is for elevation. Commence firing! Mister. Mister! Are you hurt? Are you hurt? What goes on here? What goes on? You ditched the tour, you ditched Moscow. You leave me holding the bag and then you shoot at me. What are you trying to do? If I were to tell you Hank, you'd shoot at me. Oh, very funny. Very, very funny, I'm sure. Ha ha ha. I pronounce you man and wife and wish you many, many happy years. Now you may kiss each other. He's making a big mistake. You are insulting my daughter and that is a fact. She is making a big mistake too. Attention please! Mister Meredith. We, the Musical School of Tschaikowskoye. Are giving you our Nadya. Take good care of her. She is our treasure. Our pride. And as long as we have to lose her. We are glad we lost her to you. To your happiness. To the happiness of your great country. To the happiness of our great country. To Nadya and John. God bless you both. To Nadya and John. To Nadya and John! To Nadya and John. To Nadya and John. No, no. Drink, drink. You can't win me over this way. I just can't see it, that's all. He's an American. It's unpatriotic. You will see it. You will see it. Pardon me, Mr Meredith. My name is .. - Yanovich, yes. You know Washington, DC? - Yes, been there many times. Really? Possibly you know my brother? What's your brother's name? Yanovich, Boris. He is a baker. No, I'm afraid I don't know him. - You don't know him? Thank you. He says he knows Washington DC but he doesn't know my brother Boris. Mister Meredith. - Yes, Peter? On behalf of my orchestra and myself. I wish you and Nadya all the happiness in the world. Thank you very much. - Thank you, Peter. Do you think we play hard enough? Oh, in the groove, Jackson. In the groove. This .. this means good? - Oh yes. Very good. Seriously, Peter. I didn't have a chance to tell you the other night but you've a lot of ability. Thank you. But I also have the opportunity. That's very important. Oh yes. By the way. Here. A wedding present. For me? - Sure. Take it. I can get another one. Thank you, sir. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Look. He gave me his watch. It's mine. Look, it's mine. The American. A fine fellow. My son. And now. The traditional wedding dance. Clear the tables! Can you imagine that? He says he knows Washington DC but he doesn't know my brother. Ha. There. What? My present to you. The world at dawn. I used to come up here in the mornings and dream. Dream that .. Someday I would be married to a man like .. John Meredith. Only I. I didn't think he would be an American. I was sure he'd be an American from the moment I first saw you. And now I have a little present for you. It is not as nice as the world at dawn. It's an engagement ring. But, we are already married. So much the better. Now we can always be sure that our engagement will never be broken. How was it? You were wonderful. You get better every day. I'll be right with you. So he's getting better every day? I wonder how he ever managed to conduct before you came along. How was I really? Oh, in the groove, Jackson. In the groove. John. Tell me about it. About what? - America. What does it look like? Oh, it's wonderful. Well .. what makes it wonderful? I don't know. What makes you wonderful? What will we do there? Be happy. Ah happy as we've been here? Who says we've been happy here? Be serious. What kind of a life will it be? I want to be working. Doing something. I'll put you to work alright. You will? - Yep. You're going to sell newspapers. Got the corner picked out. 42nd Street and Broadway. The best location in the world. John, I am serious. So am I. Alright. I'll tell you. You are going to practice and study just as you have been doing. Then one day you are going to give a concert at Carnegie Hall as my soloist. Oh no. I won't be good enough. Sure you will. You're good enough now. How about it? What? How about playing the concerto with me Saturday night? You are joking. - I am not. Sevastopol is as good a place for a d?but as New York. Even better. Fewer people. Yes, but .. it is being broadcast. So much the better. More people. You stick with me, honey. I've got influence. Come on, come on. They're waiting. Well, Nadya is a little nervous, Hank. What's she nervous about? What are you nervous about? Nothing. Nothing at all. I am a soloist for John Meredith every day. I am used to it. - Alright, Hank. We'll see you later. Now darling, forget about it. You know it backwards and forwards. Do you think I'd ask you to go on if I didn't know you were ready? Think of it as a rehearsal. Forget about those people out there. You talk to me as if I were a child. It is not a rehearsal. How can I forget people are there when they are there? It is being broadcast all over the country. To millions of people I don't even know. And I am scared. Nadya Ivanov Stepanova. When was the last time you wore that dress? Huh? When I married an American. Did you ever regret it? Yes. Tonight. Good luck, darling. Come on. Grandpa, is everybody listening? Everybody who loves music. Millions of people? Oh .. even more. Even more than millions? All over the country they are listening to our Nadya and John. From the Eastern Pacific to the Western frontier. The newspapers aren't out yet. Any more news on the radio? No. Has the call to your father come through yet? John. I have to go home. My people will be needing me. Darling, why don't we wait until we've talked to your father? Maybe we can decide that later. No, we can decide now. I can ride, I can shoot. And with the men going off, women will have to do more. My place is at home. Alright. I'll go with you. Oh darling, I would give anything in the world if you could go with me. Only. You can help more by continuing with your tour. To us, your music is more important now than it has ever been. What about your own music? Didn't you prove last night .. - Last night was only a promise. A beginning. But I shall someday be able to do with music .. That we can find out after the war. But what I can do at home now. That I know. John. Please don't be angry with me. Don't you think our being together is as precious to me as it is to you? Yes. I do. That's why I feel that anything we do we should do together. To me it seems obvious even now with .. The world turning upside down. But we are each of us an individual. We have different abilities. War and .. No, Nadya. We're one person. If the tour is more important for me, then it is for you too. If it's more important for you to go home, then I should go with you. You don't understand me at all, John. Sure I do. You want to help your country and you should. I just don't understand why that means we have to be separated. That's all. I'm not asking you to run away from the war. I'm not asking you to close your eyes, to forget your duty, to .. Forget everyone but us. We should do whatever is best but we should do it together. Alright. We shall. Which? Continue the tour. I just had a call from Petrov. He's willing to cancel the tour and let us out of our contract. What do you say? You can tell Petrov that's very nice but that we're going ahead. With the whole schedule? - The whole schedule. Are you crazy?

Can I have a minute, please? - Hank. I have not much time. John is waiting for me downstairs. Just a minute please. I know what you want to tell me, Hank. What? Do you think I am a fool? Well, the smart thing would be to come to America with John and me. You're not doing the smart thing. Perhaps. Goodbye, Hank. - Nadya, I want to say that .. I come from a small town too. A little place up in New England, called Lexington. A lot of fools .. like you. Fought for that once. Died for it. Right there on the village green. Someday, you'll see my town, you and John. I'm sure of it. It will still be there because, back home we have a lot of fools like you. Thank you, Hank. Well. Here's something for the train. A little vodka. It goes well with tea. Tea goes well with it, I mean. Thank you. I am glad that .. John's friend is my friend. Ah, these Russians. Too emotional. Too Russian. Sure. After all, how long will it be? I'll be down there in August for the festival. That's not so far away. And you'll be busy and I'll be busy. The weeks will just fly by. You are a fine man. Oh, nonsense. You're doing the right thing. I'm proud of you. [ Train hoot! ] Well. Better leave, darling. Goodbye, Nadya. Goodbye, Hank. Take good care of John. I will. You take care of yourself too. I'll call you from Penza. Don't forget to write. No, I won't. Goodbye. It was the only thing to do, Hank. I know. We are going to learn today how to make a Molotov cocktail. It is a home-made grenade. That is very useful in setting fire to the enemy tanks. It was first used by the people of Spain fighting the invasion of their country. To make it, you take a bottle. A vodka bottle or .. Any other bottle that is not too small. Then you take the cork and .. And put it in the bottle tightly. Then .. Forgive me for interrupting, Nadya. Children. The news from the front is serious. We have just come from regional headquarters. They have decided that all children under the age of twelve .. Must be evacuated from this region at once. The Germans are storming Smolensk. This doesn't mean that the Nazis will come here right away. It may be weeks, or never. But we can't take any chances. The children will have to go. Professor Meschkov. - Yes, Peter? When you say all children under the age of twelve .. Does that include people who are twelve already? No. Up to, but not including twelve. You will be allowed to stay. Thank you. Remember only this. You who are going, will someday be back. Music. The culture we have been building here will never die. Now Nadya, I think you had better let them go. Right. You may go, children. Nadya. Will you ask all the brigade leaders to meet with us right away. Yes, I will. Nadya. Nadya. I am afraid .. John will not be allowed to come here now. Will not be allowed? It is for his own safety. But .. Moscow is informing John that our festival is to be cancelled and that .. That he will not be given a pass to travel down here. You see, beginning today, this whole region is under martial law. I see. A call from Nadya. Relax for a few minutes, kids. My wife is on the phone. Hello? Ready with your call to Tschaikowskoye. You have two minutes only. Hello? Hello, Nadya? Oh darling, it is good to hear your voice again. How are you, darling? How do you feel? I am fine, dear. Wonderful. How about you? Were you rehearsing? Yes. Youngsters. Moscow Conservatory. You should hear them. Prize winners from all over the country. They cannot be as good as the ones down here. Well, just as good. Darling, let's not waste time. Two minutes goes by so quickly we never get a chance to say anything. Talk to me. Tell me what you are doing. Well, I .. You know. The same things. I've been teaching and .. Helping with the anti-parachute work and .. And .. John .. Has anyone talked to you about your .. Your future plans? Petrov or someone? What is there to talk about? I play my last concert here in Moscow on Saturday. Then I leave for Tschaikowskoye. And that's as far as I ever must plan. Just until the next time I see you. I know, dear. I know, John. I feel the same way. We will go out to the fields, to our hill. And all the things I've waited to tell you. All the things I've wanted to say I'll probably forget. But it won't make any difference. We'll be together. Darling. I want it to be that way with all my heart. No, John. That's the way I expect it to be. Only. But with the war and everything you can't .. John, listen, I was talking to Boris today and .. He said .. that with the front near .. No, no. There is no immediate danger, but .. John, listen to me. Boris said today that .. I'm sorry. Your two minutes are up. No. Wait a minute operator. Nadya. Nadya, what did Boris say? Never mind, darling. Be well. Be very well, my darling. Always. Comrades. Some people think that I make too many speeches. This is true. But. I never expected to find an occasion. Which called so definitely for a public statement. As you know. This is the final concert of John Meredith's tour of our country. And I want to thank you publicly on behalf of our government. And on behalf of all our people. For all you have done. Thank you. Mister Petrov. Friends. I really feel that it is I who should thank you. Before I came to Russia I .. Knew your country only through its music. Now, thanks to this tour I have been able to meet you. To talk with you, to get to know you. In fact, to marry you. By the way, that reminds me. Mister Petrov was wrong on one point. This is not my final concert. I have one more. In my wife's village, Tschaikowskoye. I do want to say that .. Playing concerts for you is one of the finest experiences a musician can have. Your kindness, the warmth of your appreciation .. [ Air-raid siren! ] "Attention!" "Attention!" "Cross over to the shelter in the subway immediately." They're really raising the roof, aren't they. Could I leave for Tschaikowskoye tonight? John, Petrov asked me to tell you yesterday. But I've waited until after this last concert. Tschaikowskoye is out. You can't go down there. What are you saying? - It's true, Mister Meredith. The festival is cancelled. Are they in danger? Well, the war .. - Tell me the truth. Well, no. Not at the moment. But the Germans are getting closer. The entire region has been placed under martial law. Can I get there by plane? You don't seem to understand, Mister Meredith. You can't get down there at all. It's impossible to get you a pass. The festival is cancelled. Do you think I'm going down there just for the festival? My wife is there. I'm sorry, Mister Meredith. Truly. But you see we are responsible for your safety. Listen, Mister Petrov. I appreciate your concern but I am asking this as a personal favor. You made a fine speech tonight. I was very moved. If you mean a word of what you say you'll see to it that I get to my wife. You'll get me a pass immediately. - It's impossible, Mister Meredith. Believe me. There is not a chance in the world. If I could help you, I would. But it is out of my hands. Impossible? Impossible? How do you know it's impossible? Well, take it to the War Department. Alright then, take it to Molotov. That's what the embassy is for isn't it? You did, huh? Alright. Thanks very much. Impossible. That's all anybody knows what to say round here: it's impossible. Take it easy, take it easy. There is your pass. It's all fixed up. You can leave for Tschaikowskoye any time you want. Hank, you old robber, you. Who did you have to see, Stalin? - No, he was too busy. No, I saw the union of musicians. They send guys to the front all the time to entertain the troops and they just .. Fixed it to count you in. I'll never forget this, Hank. Want me to wire ahead and have them meet you with a band? No, I think I'll manage this one alone. Give my love to Nadya, will you. She's a grand gal. I'll give her a big advance build-up when I get back to the USA. It's been nice knowing you, John. I'll miss you, Hank. Everybody out. Everybody out! Well, this is where you turn, Mister Meredith. Thanks for your company. Good luck to you. Thanks. Same to you. I hope you get to your wife. Quiet please. Quiet! Comrades, there is little time left for further discussion. With the Nazis coming closer and closer .. Our crop is in danger of falling into enemy hands. Some of you argued for burning the wheat immediately. Others maintain that if the Nazis are stopped .. We will regret that so many thousands of bushels of wheat .. Have been recklessly destroyed. Comrade chairman. Nadya. There is no need for any recklessness. Or any regrets. Only for common sense. To the north the Nazis have broken through already. We cannot wait. What we must do, we must do now. Therefore I propose that we start threshing .. And get the wheat ready for transportation to the rear. I propose further that we begin at once. Tonight. While we are threshing. At the same time we will make provision with gasoline and torches. So that at a moment's notice we can burn everything. As our Commander in Chief told us .. Anything that cannot be evacuated must be put to the torch. We will scorch the earth itself to keep the enemy from making use of it. I never met an American before. That is, almost never. What do you mean "almost"? Wasn't he a real American? That he certainly was. Straight from Detroit. - Yes? Who was he? My best friend. This truck. No wonder the bumps feel familiar. No, that's road. The truck is wonderful. Someday, after we've beaten the Nazis. I'm going to go to Detroit and shake hands with the fellows who built it. There is another bridge a few miles downstream. Or still was yesterday. I'd better hurry. Goodbye. Thank you very much. Goodbye, and good luck to you. - Thank you. Are you crazy? Lighting a match in a blackout sector. I'm sorry. I didn't know. What are you doing here anyway? - Trying to get to Tschaikowskoye. You are a foreigner? Yes. My name is John Meredith. Here are my papers. - John Meredith? Papers can be forged. Well then, how else can I prove it? Well, tell me. Where did you play your last concert? In Moscow. At The Conservatory. - What was in the program? Tchaikovsky's fifth. Romeo and Juliet overture. Shostakovich's first. What did you play .. When the air raid siren rang? As a matter of fact I wasn't playing. I was trying to make a speech. That's right. A very fine speech it was too. Well, thanks. How do you know all this? - I was there. Say, if you are going to Tschaikowskoye you are way off. I had better take you to the right road. Well, thanks. Wait. Not so fast, Mister Meredith. I only got one good leg. Sorry, I didn't notice in the dark. How come they let you come back here in this condition? Do you see those fires over there? Yes. That is my village burning. I was born there. My wife was born there and our children. When I heard at the hospital that the Germans were close .. I begged the doctors to let me go. They asked: what can you do with one leg? I said. I still got two hands. My eyes are still as good as ever. I still can shoot. I wish I could see your face. Why? I'd like to remember what courage looks like. Oh .. There is nothing so brave about it. Thousands of others are doing the same thing. Yeah, that's what's so incredible. You never give up. What is so incredible about it? Can you give up your mother's love? Can you forget the way she sang for you? The way she nursed you? Give up our land? How can we? It is our mother. Well. Here we are. This road will take you straight into Tschaikowskoye. I'd like to shake your hand, soldier. My friend. Goodbye. The line is still busy. Very well, Major. I will try later. Right. I'm John Meredith, an American. I need to go to Tschaikowskoye to find my wife. Just a moment. What is it? We found this man sneaking through the fields. Here are his papers. Wait outside. This passage is for Smolensk. What are you doing here? I just got through telling you. I'm trying to find my wife. I am sorry, Mister Meredith. I can only allow you to go where your pass says. You can make an exception? It's only another twenty miles. I am a soldier. And when my orders read "Smolensk", to me it means just that. Orders? Can't you think of anything else? Do you understand what it means to have your wife out there under German shells? I'm desperate, I tell you. You must let me pass. I know how you feel. I wish I could help you. But there is nothing I can do. Yes there is. Close your eyes a moment and let me pass. Alright, it is against the rules but if your own wife were out .. Shut up! You are going back with the first truck I can get. Here. Have one of mine. Thank you. You may keep this. I have plenty more. I am sorry. We are all jumpy around here. I didn't have much sleep this week. You haven't been married very long? No. Only a couple of months. I've been married almost six years. My wife. It is pretty good of her .. look at myself, the last time we were together. She looks lovely. "Permitted to proceed to the city of Smolensk." Well? It doesn't say a thing about which road you must take. What difference does it make? I want to go to Tschaikowskoye. Now don't get excited again. There are many road to Smolensk. It's true. It is a little unusual to choose one by way of Tschaikowskoye. But then you are a foreigner. You can't read the signs very well. Here. Thank you very much. I hope you will find your wife alright. And I hope you see yours again very soon. I'm afraid not. She was killed last night. Where is Tschaikowskoye? - Tschaikowskoye? It was over there. - It was? Have the Germans taken it? - I don't know. And even if they did there was nothing much left to take. They shelled it all night long. Nadya! Meschkov, where is Nadya? Have you seen her? Mister Meredith. Welcome to Tschaikowskoye. It's a great honor .. - Stop that, Meschkov. Have you seen Nadya? What's happened to her? Look what they've done to our music. Do you know where everybody is? I am looking for my wife, Nadya Stepanova. No. Maybe she was evacuated with the old people and the kids. No. She wouldn't leave, I'm sure of that. If she's alive, she's here. Well, she might have gone to the woods to join the guerrillas. A lot of them do that. Or maybe she is with the men out there in the fields burning up the crops. Thank you very much. Where is Nadya Stepanova? - I don't know. Nadya! Nadya! Is Nadya Stepanova over there? - I don't know her. Nadya! Nadya! Nadya! Nadya! Oh darling, are you alright? I was so worried about you. I am fine. Now. Nadya, it is so good to look at you again, to hear your voice. Oh darling, I love you so much. It almost hurts my heart. I thought I would never see you again. I am here darling, with you. And I'll never leave you. Say it again. Over and over again. I'll never leave you, Nadya. Never. Mister Meredith. Boris. Father. Good to see you all. I ran into soldiers on the way. They said the Germans were getting close. Are you going to leave here with the Army or do you have other plans? We have no plans. We are going to stay right here in those woods. We'll make them pay in blood for every home they've ruined. For every foot of our land they've ravaged. Mister Meredith! Mister Meredith. Watch out Peter, a plane! Lie down! Lie down! I'll be alright, Mister Meredith. I'm so sorry about the watch. I'm afraid I didn't take very good care of it. Don't you worry about that. I'll buy you another one. Mister Meredith. Yes, Peter? Maybe. When the war is over. You will let me be your pupil? Why sure, Peter. We'll do great work together. I was just talking to your father about it. We think you'll make a fine conductor. Thank you. Rest in peace, my son. If you let me hold on to this, I'd like to stay here and fight with you. We would be proud to have you with us, Mister Meredith. It would be a great honor. But I am afraid it is not the right way. Why not? Because there is so much more that you can do. You can go back to your country and tell them what you have seen here. You are a great musician. Your people love and respect you. And whether you speak to them in words or in music .. They will know it to be the truth. Mister Meredith, we may be cut off any minute now. And how can I make you understand that this is the greatest thing you can do? But you are asking me to leave my wife. No. Nadya goes with you. But. Boris. My place is here with you. No, Nadya. Your place is wherever you can fight best. Our country asks from each of us just that. You can help your husband in America to tell them that we will hold on. That millions like your father .. My son. Are not sacrificing their lives in vain. That with us there is no doubting, no question. Nothing but to win. No matter how far the Germans get on the map of Russia. They will never conquer one single mile of it. Your share in this fight is just as important as ours. No matter where your duty takes you. And no matter how far away you and John may be. We will feel you fight?ng side-by-side with us. "All soldiers in the same Army." "Fighting to bring a new life to our children." "For that great day of victory ..." "When the whole world will ring with the new song of freedom." "For you will be bringing our great countries closer together." "In this fight for all humanity." T-G ?
