I've just moved recently Do you have the address? Uhh, I do remember the building name! It's called "Sunrise Katamiya" Ah! The one by the building that's under construction! That's the one! How did you know? That's amazing! Kawamura! Go show her the way! Sorry, I'd love to do just that, but I'm currently on duty... Ah, that's okay! I'll be fine with just some directions.

Unlicensed use of fireworks, not to mention trespassing?! Everything's fine now Thank you very much! No, thank you Heh? Hinageshi! You know you're not supposed to bring belongings with you down the ladder! Sorry! ...Sorry about that! That board's important to you, right? I've been using it since I was a kid, so it's been through a lot! Please show me again sometime How you ride the waves I can see it from the rooftop From our fire depar- Hinageshi, move out! Haha, see ya! Ah, wait! Well, uh If you're interested... Wanna try sometime? Riding the waves! Ohh, seems you've already taken the bait Come on! Kawamura! Just a bit more! You got this! Use those legs! Keep at it! You can do it! Keep going! Keep calm! Kawamura! You got this! Keep at it! Good work today Maybe I'm not cut out for this... Even if you failed today you can still improve next time! It's not that easy! Seems like I picked the wrong career... Have you seen Mr. Koba's map? He can get a full grasp on the best routes and plan like it's second nature It's not easy to get to that point It's only the ones that keep up the effort all the way to the end Who can be like that You've got a good build, so I'm sure you'll get better than me! See ya later! Senpai! You seem pretty happy I'm gonna go catch some waves! Was I a bit early? Huh? No, I'm not sleepy at all... Huh? That's weird... Haha, it's fine to sleep until we get there Cleaning up must have been tough It was just moving everything from the 8th to the 2nd floor, so it's all taken care of! The building material on the balconies there are pretty flammable So it spread up through the balconies real quick Please be careful Got it, I'll keep that in mind! But that was pretty rough huh They were messing with fireworks in that half finished building right? Having to deal with people like that... I really with they'd give us a break too Seems like it's some sort of trend to upload videos like that online I used to live around there when I was little, But we had to move for my Dad's work... I've always wanted to come back here So I decided on the university here Umm... And what was your name again? Eh? Ahh, I'm so sorry! I had no idea how pronounce your name... It's Hinageshi Eh? So this is read as 'Hinageshi' huh Hinageshi, Minato Ah! 'Minato' is right. My first name isn't read as 'Kou' Speaking of, my name is pronounced 'Mukaimizu' Though people always get it wrong as 'Mukoumizu' I see. By the way, during a fire it's best to head for lower ground if possible Is that a finless porpoise? That's right! Not a beluga! I thought so! You really do like them don't you! Your car has its face after all! I love them too! - It does look kind of like a Barchetta doesn't it! - Note: 'Bacherutta' (バケルッタ): I'm assuming this is a made up car brand based off of the Barchetta (バルケッタ) Should I put on some music? Got any requests? I'd like to hear one of your favourites Hmm, well then Ah, this song really brings me back!

You've caught it! Now just stand! Paddle paddle paddle! Woah! Alright! And stand! Split the wave! Are you alright? Until... Cool... I'll... Try harder! I'll make some coffee Starting from there? That smells pretty good! I brought a blend that goes well with sandwiches Ahh... It's freshly ground, so it expands puffs up quite a bit Why is that? When you brew fresh grinds, it releases carbon dioxide Seems complicated! I'll be making egg salad sandwiches You really can do anything huh, Hinageshi Are you a super human? Superman? That's Amazing! I thought so back when you saved me during the fire too That you were basically like a hero, ya know? Not at all Also, I'm fine with you using my first name I'd also prefer to just call you 'Hinako' Uwah! It got me! Sign: Beware of Black Kites!! They target moving things, swooping in from behind. Their sharp claws may cause injury to people. Caution is advised. Paddle paddle! Good good! You can do it! Lookin' good, lookin' good! This time for sure! Sorry! Even though you went and came to a place with easier waves just for me! Even if you've failed this time You can still ride the next waves that come! Besides It's thanks to coming here that I got to enjoy a great cafe like this I've been interested in this shop for a while now It's great they have enough fire extinguishers too Ah Hehe, if I'm with you, Hinageshi- I mean Minato, I'm sure you'll come to my rescue Yeah! I'll come save you, no matter what! Ah, it's probably time we head out... Ah, yeah I can take care of that Oh, no it's fine! Ah, wait up! Ahh! I'm so sorry! It's fine, don't worry about it! It's old manually operated machinery after all You from Tokyo? From Chiba! Oh my, you don't say! An old employee of mine opened a shop there Please check it out if you have some time The machinery there is a bit more modern It'd be great... If I could open a store like this someday Sorry for being all flustered back there! Do you want to... Catch some waves again...

What? My friends are also aggressive and have sharp tongues! Scorpion Jun and Cobra Ai What's with those nicknames... Then I guess Youko would be a Blue-Ringed Octopus? An octopus? Small but has spit full of deadly Tetrodotoxin! You really seem to know her well, big bro! I'm leaving! I only came to observe what kind of girlfriend you got after all And I think I've learned quite a bit already! About what? That love is for stupid people like you! This Blue-Ringed Octopus Youko has too much poison in her spit so she'll be taking her leave! Bye Ah! See you again, Youko! Again?! My immune system's pretty tough so I'll be fine! Jeez! That part about you really helps me out She's like that after all... So it seems she doesn't make many friends And she wasn't going to school for a while But She's finally going again recently That so... She may be like that, but please be her friend Of course! It's Mt. Fuji! You can see Mt. Fuji! Amazing! A message for Ms. Mai Uchida from Mr. Shou Namiko Merry Christmas! From now on, I want to be with you forevermore... Marry me! That's amazing! How wonderful! Really? It seems you can reserve a message to be played for you in advance Shall we head on up? A message for Ms. Yoshiko Kamiichi Mom, thank you for everything you do... Merry Christmas! So pretty! Think we can see our area from here? Oh my... Shall we write one too? Eh? Nah, I wouldn't know what to write anyways Yeah, I bet you don't know how to write my name either I can too! Then? [Mukaimizu Hinako] And? [Hinageshi (Spelled phonetically) Minato] [Mukaimizu Hinako] Your last name's way too hard! What are you gonna do if it becomes yours too! Eh? What was that? Hey! Seems they're lining up for pictures Yes, looking great! What a great couple! Perfect! Hinako, over here! Come here Key to the heart... Here! It's snowing! Ahh... I've got the morning shift tomorrow... Even though it's Christmas... Did you know that after it snows We'll get some nice big waves And there's a legend that If you can catch those waves, your wishes will come true But I still haven't gotten a single chance to try it That's amazing! How do you put it on so cleanly? If you fry the outside well While keeping the inside runny It becomes nice and springy, making it easy to put on See? Like this Want to try putting it on? Yeah! Ah! Don't rush It's still fi- Ahh... Even though it's Christmas You really fine with eating omelet rice in a place like this? Yup When I was a kid omelet rice would be my favourite treat Besides, I wanted it to be just the two of us Isn't it hard to eat with your left hand? No problem! I've been practicing! So that we could keep holding hands even when eating I want to stay connected with you whenever we're together Then how about we live together? I'm moving out of my parents place If you say that I might really take you up on it! Fine by me When at? Eh? That's still a bit... When I can ride my own wave Right now I'm relying on you for everything... But I want to be steady on my own two feet as well And find my own calling, like you have, Minato You have great talent, Hinako So I'm sure you'll find it in no time There wasn't really anything I was good at Is that sarcasm? When I was little, I almost drowned and I've always remembered how I was saved I also wanted to become stronger But I couldn't do it no matter what I tried But by chance one day I saw some newly hatched sea turtles Sea turtles? They hatch on the beach Heard of them? Woah, what's this? Turtles? When I saw them desperately crawling their way towards the ocean I felt that I needed to work hard like that too I started going with my grandpa on his coastal patrols And gradually started to find my current career path I wanted to help others through my work That's what I thought You're amazing! Forget helping other people... I've already got my hands full with my own stuff And I'm always the one being saved too... I'm sure you'd be able to easily get over any hurdles, Minato I definitely can't ride the waves like you can, Hinako Just think of other things like you do the ocean. Swim, rest when you're tired Then just keep swimming - I'll be your safe Harbor - Note: His name, Minato (港) in Japanese literally means 'Port' or Harbor' When you need to rest... Just call for me whenever you need me How long will I keep getting your help? 10 years, 20 years... Even if you've become a grandma Until you'll be able to ride the waves yourself... ♪ As you gaze at the water's surface ♪ ♪ It sparkles like a billion stars ♪ See you soon Be over after catching some waves Eh? No way! George... George... George! George! Jeez Minato! Ignoring me to keep surfing! Hinako... Hinako! Hello! The person you are calling is unavailable Or may be out of reception range Please leave a message after the beep Hello, Hinako? Are you okay? Please call me back when you're feeling up for it. I'll be waiting! The current call was received on: The 16th, 2:42 PM Excuse me! You're there, aren't you! Please open the door! Sorry for coming over all of a sudden... This new place is quite far from the sea, huh? I felt that here, I wouldn't have to look at the sea much... Here's the stuff left at my brother's place Is there anything you need here? I'm... So sorry... Bringing over these things all of a sudden... It must be bringing back the pain, huh... The hell are you doing crying in someone else's home? But you know... I never thought Senpai would... Disappear like that... That's so like him... To pass away... Saving someone's life! You're wrong! It was me... I told him that good waves would come after it snows... Stop that. No matter who you blame my brother's not coming back! I'm... Sorry... Sorry... Here My brother's phone I'm leaving everything here so do what you want with it! You can throw it all away if you want! Youko! In fact it's better if you do! Ah, uh... Here's my contact info Please let me know if there's anything I can do to help... Youko! Is that a finless porpoise? This is an app for getting info on the waves. There's something like that? I'll install it on your phone as well! The person you are calling is currently unavailable Or is outside of reception range Please leave a message after the beep Why can't you make yourself available and get in reception range?! Didn't you say that you'd always be by my side?! Minato? Here Eat up Have some coffee too Hey! Oh yeah... Guess you're reminded by everything you see, huh? Sorry... It's fine Can't help it You two are both so nice... Even though you'd always call us dumb love-birds A bunch of clouds for brains Or say damn normies can go explode... Our bad Just us and our sharp tongues Is that... Your boyfriend's? There's a passcode so I can't check inside... Even though we always went together... Why did he have to go overnight by himself? I just want to know... So this is a blue-ringed octopus... And what about your birthday, Youko? February 3rd My bro definitely wouldn't have remembered something like my birthday... - When is Marine Day this year? - Note: A National Holiday in Japan, cause you know, oceans are a big deal there July 15th What about Disaster Preparedness Day? September 1st It's not someone's birthday... Not the day of the fire, or the day we went surfing... None of these dates are working... Shall we try asking Wasabi? Eh? You've met him right? The one who carried the cardboard box to your place, Mukoumizu His last name's Kawamura? By the way... My last name is pronounced 'Mukaimizu'... Let's call him out for tea or something! He should be off duty today This is the place we came to last time huh It seems they have a main store in Chigasaki. It'd be great if I could open a store like this one day. There are all sorts of ways to enjoy coffee No kidding... I'll have a strawberry soda! Ah, sorry to keep you wait- Oh! The hell are you doing?! Are you alright?! Sorry about that... Stay right there! I'll go get a dishcloth! Ah! I'm so sorry! That expression! It's gonna ruin the taste of the coffee Sorry... I wasn't supposed to be such a crybaby... A baby at this age needs to grow up already!

How 'bout going back to your family for a while? It's best not to push yourself too hard, Hinako. There! There! Look look! It's definitely Minato... I'm sure of it His ghost?

I wonder if that's the case... You still had lingering regrets? My wish might have actually come true! I see you've moved Eh? Yeah... Haven't been surfing? Looking at the sea is... A bit painful... Sorry, it's because of me isn't it Oh, no no! Forget it, we've finally got to see each other again! It's like I'm dreaming, being able to meet and talk to you again. Minato, you'll come out of the water whenever I sing right? I don't really understand it myself... But give me a call whenever you need me! Ah, Youko's doing well! Wasabi too! Yeah, I caught some glimpses of them I see... It seemed like those two couldn't see you though. Am I the only one that can see you? Having you see is more than enough for me! Okay Ah, that's right! Tell me your passcode What are you doing trying to look through my phone at this point? That day... I want to know why you went to go surfing by yourself without telling me. That was... Because I wanted to practice in secret, to surprise you later! Really? It's true! I don't remember raising a girlfriend who would go and look at other's phones without asking! Petty! Ah, I got soaked earlier so I'm gonna take a bath! Just stay there alright! What's this, I'm living together with Minato? Moving in together? Marriage?

I don't really mind though... Ouch! Are you alright? That was surprising! Ah, sorry about that! Where you from? Um, from Chiba You mean here? What a big pal you're bringing along there! Something wrong? Ah, yeah... I was just thinking how I can't even hold your hand like this... Or help you up, like that guy earlier... Oh? Could this be jealousy? No way I won't ever cheat, you're the only one for me! I said that's not it! This must be our first argument! Cheer up! One more Oh, how greedy! Will you forgive me now? Nope! Whaat? One more Will you do one more thing for me? What is it? Take me to the sea I want to see you surfing Just one more time Sorry... I should be sorry... Saying that without thinking about your feelings I used to live around here as a kid... I was always surfing, and could catch the waves whenever I wanted. But now... Whether it's the sea or anything else I have no idea where I should be rowing towards... Now matter how small the wave It had to power to come in from far away Right now you're just having a bit of trouble against that power. I'm also one wave out of many You need to prepare yourself for the next wave, too. You're saying some pretty depressing stuff I'm good with you, Minato! I'll be with you for the rest of my life! I'm here to help, and I'll be cheering you on, too! Until you're able to ride your own wave Welcome! Huh? What's up? I heard from your mom that you started working here. I wanted to talk to you about something Manager, I'll be taking my break! Well, drink up What brought you all the way here? It's alright! You're fine just doing things your own way, Wasabi! Youko... My brother told you so too, right? Cheer up! No, see... It's not about failing at work or anything... It's not? It's about Hinako... Oh, that so. She's been acting strange Ain't she always? She keeps talking to the water inside a bottle. And taking Minato's Finless Porpoise doll around everywhere. And well... It's like she thinks Senpai's in the water or something. You were following her the whole time? Ah... I was curious... Why? I wonder why... Senpai was always looking at her surfing from the department roof... And as I looked as well... It just kinda... But, she was Senpai's girlfriend, so... Ah no, that wasn't what I was trying to say... I was, worried about the current Hinako And I just couldn't get her off my mind Stupid Wasabi Huh? If you're so worried about her then why don't you actually go to her? Just say it to her directly You like her don't you? Why are you coming to me?! I'm telling you now, but love is for stupid people! Manager, I'm done with my break! Woah! Ah, I'm sorry! Um, here, I never got a chance to return this. You're the firefighter from that time?! You never noticed...? Ah, sorry about that! No need for the towel right now, it's not too bad! Here for flowers today? Ah, yes I hope she'll like them! The person you're giving these to Huh? Ah, she's someone who likes the sea So I got them in blue and white but... Is that a bit too boring...? Not at all! They're wonderful! That's good You... don't have it with you today? The things you're always walking around with lately Like the water bottle filled with water I'm working so... Or that plastic finless porpoise Eh? How do you know about that? Ah, well... I noticed when you came to the department and in other places as well... though it was hard to call out to you It was like... you were talking to Senpai in the water bottle- Ah, sorry, that was just me talking to myself! But! Ah, you should hurry and send these over, before they dry up! Um! These are for you! Huh? Then the person who liked the sea... I was also, always looking your way! Am I not good enough? Am I not able to cheer you up? I want you to be happy! Because I like you! Ah, B-b-b-b-but that... Eh... I'm sorry! ♪ As you gaze at the water's surface! What's wrong, Hinako? Wasabi's, Wasabi...

Even I feel he's honest, and kind... Why would you say that...? I'm fine with how things are now! I can meet you whenever I sing. Even if I can't hold your hand, or hug you You'll still be by my side from now on, right? I'm fine with just that! Calm down, Hinako! Talking to the toilet like this'll makes you look crazy! Ah! I kinda panicked... Listen, Hinako... New waves will keep on coming They won't all be good ones, so there will be farewells, too. If you stay dived under the surface You'll never be able to ride them forward Hinako! Call 911! It's an accident! The person in the small car can't get out! It's no use, there's no saving him!

But Minato's there! In the water! He'll come out when I sing! I can see him! He's... Definitely not gone! Minato! He'll always be with me! Certainly, Senpai loved you so much it wouldn't be weird for him to come back! But... I think even he wouldn't want for you to become like this! He told me... That you were his hero... Weren't you able to smoothly ride the waves all by yourself! Why are you now... I know... I know but... With you like this Senpai will never be able to pass on! Hinako!

I especially recommend drip brewing Please try not to make the mistake of ordering only strawberry soda. That's amazing, Youko! You come to make fun of me? No way! I heard that you were working here, so From Wasabi? Yeah... Did he mention anything else? Eh? No, not really... I actually wish I was a blue ringed octopus! I seriously want to bite that guy! What? It's nothing Why are you working here, Youko? I decided to open a cafe Huh? It was my brother's dream to have a cafe So I will realise that dream That's why I'm learning the ropes while working here. Did you know? The reason it puffs up so much when you make drip coffee is because of the released CO2! That gas is slowly released after roasting And continues to be released after grinding Making it puff up Puffing is a sign of freshness After graduating high school I'll be going straight to the main store in Chigasaki to train. The owners there might retire any day after all! This time you're visiting my home? Seems a bit belated. I'm sorry I still couldn't take it all back then And I've yet to pay my respects... Your parents? At work They've finally gotten themselves back into it! So thinking about my brother would... Sorry for the trouble My brother's room has been left as is You want to take a look right? Yeah My brother always had that cool look on his face. Which made it seem like he was someone who could do everything from the get go. But he was someone who really put in the effort. Both our parents work, so he'd make us dinner. And he was absolutely horrible at first But he read books watched cooking shows and stuff And at some point he became great at cooking. With studying too Even after he became a firefighter He'd say that if he didn't keep working hard he'd sink down like the blockhead he was. We were like night and day After he passed away A whole bunch of people came to pay their respects. Saying how he'd really helped them out My brother Made it his goal to become someone who could help others. And what made him think that way Was that when he was little and was saved from being drowned? The one that saved him was a girl even smaller than himself. He felt that if he worked hard he could do something like that as well. He had his life saved by that girl So he wanted to work to save others as well His life was saved by a hero So he wanted to use it to save others What? What now? Coming home all of a sudden, what's the matter? Have I ever saved a boy from drowning at sea before?! The thing that was put on the front page right? Just wait one second Here it is! They said you were a hero! ♪ As you gaze at the water's surface ♪ ♪ It sparkles like a billion... ♪ Awesome! You did great, girl! When the ambulance arrives guide them over! Great! Alright! I'm turning you on your side, bring your knees up! Great work! Way to go! You were saved by this little girl here! His life was saved by a hero When I was little, I almost drowned in the ocean I've always remembered how I was saved back then I wanted to help others through my work That's what I thought It was used in a recent movie, so it's become pretty popular again ♪ That's right take your imagination ♪ ♪ Make it shine as a Brand New Story ♪ ♪ And so as the seasons go on ♪ I found my raison d'être ♪ We'll take these growing feelings ♪ Hinako I rode the waves after a snowfall and landed an air reverse 360 You said that with this my wishes will come true, right? My wish is That you will be able to ride your own wave And... That I can be by your side forever and ever! When I saw them desperately crawling their way towards the ocean. I felt that I needed to work hard like that, too. Jobs for saving people Are you interested in lifesaving? We get surfers, as well as people, who can't swim but still want to try. It's important to be able to save people at sea, of course. But the ultimate goal is to prevent accidents from happening in the first place. The people who get qualified do all sorts of sports. The ratio of guys to girls is 6 to 4 In the summer we monitor the sea during our summer camp. And we participate in competitions as well Yoo! You run when you're off duty too? The locations of fire hydrants can change quite a bit if you don't keep yourself updated. And so I started going on runs, though it's not really my job to know all that... My brother was also always going around town checking for hazards. He said that prevention was the best way to fight fires. Senpai really was amazing No matter how hard I try I'll never... Well of course you'll never ever reach him Indeed... Am I not good enough? Am I not able to cheer you up? Why did you want to become a firefighter, Wasabi? Huh? Why, you ask... Isn't being a firefighter pretty cool? If you can drive a firetruck, isn't that just awesome? You say that like it's the most obvious thing, but that's it? Thanks There's sugar over there Yeah. Maybe I was a bit naive in choosing my whole career. Want some? Ah! I was pretty confident in my physical fitness, but it really demands a whole other level. No matter how much effort I put in I'll never become like Senpai! I'm definitely not suited to be a firefighter! Something as outrageous as saving other people's lives. Is impossible for me... The sugar! Your brain really is full of sugar! Ah sorry, I put in too much I don't really have a very developed palate like Senpai. You can shut up about Senpai this Senpai that already! There's no need for you to become like my brother! You should just do your best, in your own way! Yo-Youko, you really know how to cheer me up Idiot, those were the very same words you said to me before. When I wasn't going to school and my mom was being all disparaging about how different I was from my brother. You said that it was fine for me to just be myself. I couldn't put amazing effort into everything like my brother. And I was bad at dealing with other people, too. But thanks to what you said If it was fine to do things my own way... That took a huge burden off my shoulders I was able to start going to school again! I was saved by you, Wasabi! With my words... I was able to save someone as well huh... Thanks, Youko! I think I can keep going after all! I've got work so I'll be going now You can finish your drink, just return the tools to the cafe later. Ever since then I've always liked you! Moreso than anyone else! Do your best! You idiot! When duty calls, we contact the emergency services, as well as bring an AED. Firstly, you check for a response by calling out to the victim. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? No response. Confirm if they're still breathing. Chest compressions. 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10 Put two hands together, and utilise your body weight to push. For adults, do at least 30 compressions about 5 centimeters deep. Time your push so that the chest fully expands before pressing down. 29-30! Raise the chin and pinch the nose to secure the airway. One second intervals between breaths One more time Check to make sure the chest rises when doing this. After that return to doing chest compressions. 5-6-7... And repeat 30 times Well then, please give it a try Miss Mukaimizu Eh? 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10!
