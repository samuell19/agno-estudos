It's going really good. I'm meeting him on Thursday for a nightcap. Yeah, I know, I know. Hold on, can I help you? - I'm here about the warehouse job. - Okay. If you could fill this application out, have a seat, and we'll call you when we're ready. (phone ringing) Yes, Mr. Benson? Your next applicant is Frank Walker. Okay, I'll send him right in. Mr. Walker, you're next, just follow me. You can leave your bag there. This is Mr. Benson's office. Hand him your application, and good luck. Oh Mr. Walker, take off your hat. - Good morning Mr. Walker, I'm Henry Benson, nice of you to come in. Please, sit down. (foreboding music) I see from your application here you were incarcerated? - Uh yes, it was a long time ago. - I see. Yeah, I see. Do you mind telling me what it was all about? - Well... Well I'd rather not, it's in my past now and I'm a changed man. - Hmm... Well Frank, I just don't think I could use you. - Am I not qualified? - You see Frank, in our company we have a reputation for excellence in employees. Now if I were looking to hire an ex-con, you'd be my guy, but unfortunately for you I'm not. - Look, can you just give me a chance? - I'm sorry Frank, no. And my decision is final. I mean for God's sake we're right across the street from an elementary school. - Hey I didn't harm any kids. - Yeah not yet. - You son of a bitch. - Look, Frank. I can tell by your eyes that you're probably medicated. And I don't know if it's prescription or not, I don't care, but the one thing I do know, I'm not gonna let a guy like you on my dock, operating my equipment. Good luck and uh, thank you for coming in. (door slamming shut) (anticipatory music) (car engine revving) (upbeat music) (chattering) - Hey Brad, can I have two Buds? - [Brad] Yeah, give me a minute. - Hey Connie. - [Connie] Hey. - Hey I uh, (mumbling). - Are you drunk? - Hey bud, I've seen you in here a few times. Let me give you a little friendly advice. Work on your pickup lines, will you? First impressions are everything. And you're just not giving out the best one. All right everyone, last call! - That's some bull! - Yeah, if you don't like it, go over to Johnny's. - Last call, last call. - Can I get a six for the road? - Yeah you got it. - Hey Brad. - [Brad] Hey. - Can I get a beer? - Hey Dee, you and me? - Hah, in your dreams Charlie. (upbeat music) (chattering) - Oh, hi Frank. You startled me. How are you? - (sighs) Why do you ask? - I don't know, you look upset. Is everything okay? - [Frank] Yeah, I'm fine. - Okay. If you ever need to talk. Good night. (eerie music) - [Voiceover] Frank this is (mumbling). I'm going crazy. Better take your pills, Frank. Better take your pills, Frank... I just can't do this anymore... I don't know what to do... What do I do, what do I do? (eerie music) (door knocking) (door knocking) - [Charlie] Frank, hey Frank. Frank! (door knocking) - Who is it? - Frank, it's me Charlie. Charlie from the bar. - What do you want? - Hey Frank, I noticed you picked up a six. Figured we kick some back? I mean, the night is young right? I got some smoke. (footsteps tapping) (door knocking) (door knocking) (footsteps tapping) What was all that about? - Rent money. - [Charlie] Yeah, yeah times are tough. - Come on, let's go sit down. Come on in. (foreboding music) - Look at all the frigging letters. - I'll get you a chair. - You'd better get me a broom. - Here, sit down. I'll get us a couple of beers. (foreboding music) - You know Frank, I've seen you at the bar. And I really pity you man. I mean... I heard around, that you haven't been out too long. That you're trying to get your life together. Shit man, I know it's tough, I've been there. Walking around like a fricking zombie, no money, no job, no friends, you're like a lost soul, in a world where nobody wants you. I mean, who wants a lunatic? - What did you say? - I said who wants a lunatic, that's what you are, right Frank? Word on the street is, you have a history of being down the funny farm. Or was it prison? - I don't see how it's any concern, Charlie. - Yeah, I guess you're right. I thought we were just two friends talking here. Can I get another beer? - Yeah... - What was it that you got yourself locked up Frank? Rob a bank? Kill somebody? - You ask a lot of personal questions Charlie. - Well shit Frank, you don't say too fucking much. I mean, you're freaking creepy. And every time a freaking piece of ass even gets close to getting close, you open up your mouth, and you freak 'em out. Makes it goddamn near impossible for the rest of us when you're around. - Why don't you speak your mind Charlie? - Okay asshole, you wanna know the truth? I may be the only guy that doesn't think you're a ticking time bomb psychopath ready to go nutjob on everybody, I mean here I am, trying to get to know you better, maybe even try to even get your life together. Nobody likes you Frank, nobody. Is that honest enough? - You need another beer Charlie? - Yeah. - [Frank] Okay. - You know Frank, I don't mean to offend, I'm just telling it like it is. I don't think you're such a bad guy. Just a little bit of a retard (laughs)! (anticipatory music) An ex-con retard no less.

(ominous music) Hey, can I get a little of that? - What the fuck am I looking at? - I know what I'm looking at. A guy who hasn't paid his rent in two months (laughs)! (door knocking) Who is it? - Hey Frank, you in there? - Looks like you're up shit's creek without a paddle. - I need my pills. - You don't need those pills Frank. Listen to me, and I'll set you straight. Forget about those pills Frank. If you start taking those again, you'll never get a job, or a girlfriend, you'll never fit in anywhere. Every time somebody looks at you, they'll know you're either a nutjob or a retard. The best decision you ever made was to throw away those pills. - I probably killed you because of that decision. - Listen, there's bound to be a few bumps in the road. You just gotta live with running 'em over. Now come on Frank, think about it. You've been alone for so long. Not a friend, not a lover. Not a person in the world you can turn to. It ain't those pills you need, believe that Frank, you need me! - So any advice before I go on this job interview? - Yeah, skip the interview, get us a six pack (laughs). - That's some great advice. - Ah Frank, what do I know about interviews? I've been on disability for 12 years. Before that, I was on unemployment. - I need this job. - Go get 'em kid. (foreboding music) I guess it didn't go to well huh buddy? You stop at the bar on the way home? You say hi to the fellas for me? - No Charlie I didn't. I'm going to bed. - You know Frank I've been thinking. Maybe I can give you some advice about what you're doing wrong. - [Frank] All right, I'm listening. - You need to show these guys that you can assert yourself, show 'em that you're organized and focused. They don't think you're capable? Well you go in there, and show 'em what you're capable of. - Oh Ms. O'Reilly, should I expect to see you tonight? - I just gotta let the dog out, I'm coming right over. - My door will be open. As usual. (laughs) (car engine revving) (ominous music) - [Voiceover] Well you see Frank. At our company here we have a reputation for excellence in employees. Now if I were looking to hire an ex-con, you'd be my guy, but unfortunately for you, I'm not. (ominous music) I can tell by your eyes that you're probably medicated. (ominous music) (car horn honking) (ominous music) (sighs) (anticipatory music) (thudding) - Wake up Henry, it's me. It's Frank Walker. I'm here about that job. - Frank Walker? What, what's going on? Hey what are you doing? - Henry I don't think you gave me a fair shake. You used my past as judgment, and you used it to cast doubt upon me. And worst of all, you used it to insult me. And I can't tolerate that. - Look Frank, Frank, I didn't mean to insult you. I was just being honest. I know I may have seemed harsh. - Henry I appreciate your honesty, I really do. I mean you were right, I couldn't be trusted (mumbling). You made me feel half-dead. Although, in your defence it was my brutally violent half. - Look, Frank, you don't have to do this. You can still change your life around. - Do you really think so Henry. - Yeah, I do. - Me too. (ominous music) - Mr. Benson. This is Ms. O'Reilly. Henry? Henry? (screams) (hallowing music) - Frank, wake up Frank. Wake up, Frank, Frank, Frank... You're gonna get a late start today aren't you Frank? The early bird catches the worm, don't you know? You're not gonna get any work sleeping the day away, that's for sure. - Take it easy on him Henry, he's had a long night. Hey, did you go to the bar last night Frank? - [Frank] No Charlie I didn't. - Frank, Frank you gotta get your life together. Why don't you take a good look in the mirror and tell me what it is you see. I see a man in a desperate state of damnation. A week ago you walked into my office. You were like a (mumbling), no fire, no determination. You practically took no for an answer before you sat down. But last night, hmm... Last night was far different wasn't it? You showed me you were a man willing to take action. Yes, yes. You were somebody who gets things done. You showed me you were a force to be reckoned with, somebody who could accomplish big things if he puts his mind to it. That me impressed me, that impressed me Frank, it impressed me very much. I was wrong in not hiring you Frank, I see that now. - Well better late than never huh? - Yeah what good does that do you? Does that change anything? You still have no work, you're broke and you're running out of options. I can help you Frank. I can tell you what you need to do. - Hey Frank, this guy sounds like he knows what he's talking about. Maybe you ought to listen? - All right Henry. What is it I need to do? (muttering) - So, what happened? - I gave him a firm handshake. Looked him in the eye. I told him my past had been paid for but my rent hadn't. I got the job. (laughing) - See that kid, stick with me and you'll go places. - Stick with you, if it wasn't for me-- - If it wasn't for me, Frank would've never brought you home. - Guys, I got the job, let's celebrate. (door knocking) I'll be back later. - Frank! You motherfucker! (chattering) (rock music) - [Brad] Yo Connie, your bucket's up. - Thank you. - Hey Connie. - Hey. - Connie, I have been out of work for a really long time, and uhm, I haven't paid my rent for a really, really long time. As a matter of fact I haven't been-- - I've gotta get back to work, okay? - Hey Brad, (mumbling). - [Frank] Another beer and a shot. - I don't know why you say the shit that you say. I've told you before, and I'm telling you for last time, please, stop hitting on the ladies all right? It's bad for business. I don't need that kind of trouble here at the bar. - Look, can you just give me some tips? - Frank, as much as I would like to help you, I just don't have that kind of time. Shit brother, eternity doesn't have that kind of time. Hah, some tips, what am I, Fozzy? Hey Pete, you mind if I check off a little bit early? It's kinda good now and I'm bushed. - What, (mumbling)? - Come on, all right? - Come on get outta here kid. Hey, take the trash out on the way out okay? - All right got it, I'll see you tomorrow. - [Pete] Yeah I'll see you tomorrow. (rock music) - Hey Cortez what's up man? I'm on my way down, I should be there shortly. I've got your six man. What was her name? Jesus Christ, Shalonda? Hey man how's it going guys? - [Man] Hey how you doing? - Come on brother, what are these chicks into? You're really not a picker, I'll give you that. All right, (mumbling), all right (mumbling), all right bye. (scuffling) (screaming) (scuffling) Shit! (groaning) (whimpering) (ominous music) (car engine revving) - I stopped by the bar tonight, Charlie. - Good evening, I am Ann Lohaus. Our top story today is the grizzly discovery of yet another victim of foul play in Jersey City. Henry Benson, founder and CEO of Benson Shipping, was found murdered in his Jersey City home late last night. An employee of Mr. Benson discovered his body. Investigators are questioning the woman and haven't ruled her out as a suspect. Benson Shipping handles 20% of all ocean cargo coming into the East Coast, and Mr. Benson was a highly regarded member of the community. Police say robbery did not appear to be the motive. Anyone with information should immediately contact local authorities. This comes just a few days after the discovery of a still unidentified body found in a local Jersey City landfill, Joe. - And now more, a bizarre story coming out of Pennsylvania. - Like I was saying Frank, you're going about it all wrong. You see, you've got that bad boy personality. But you're using it the wrong way. Women are naturally drawn to you, but as soon as you open up your mouth, they wanna take out a restraining order on you. - I don't know, what am I doing wrong? - You've got to start lying Frank. Women don't want to hear the fine details. You leave that to their imagination. You have to understand that all women are screwed up in the head, they believe in these ridiculous fantasies. And as a single guy it's your duty to make these fantasies seem real to them, even though it's all just bullshit anyway. - I don't get it. - Just lay the foundation for the fantasy and everything else will fall into place. Come on Frank, when you're standing there, staring into Connie's eyes, you just tell her... - I guess I'm just (mumbling). I didn't mean to freak you out the other night. I just have a lot of trouble expressing myself. - That's okay Frank, I have seen that troubled look in your eyes. Uhm, you know, you say things that really freak me out sometimes, but, I like this open and honest Frank a whole lot better. I don't know what you're doing later, if you wanna stick around, maybe after my shift we can get some coffee. - Yeah definitely. - [Connie] Cool, okay, see ya later. (rock music) (chattering) - Hey how's it going? - [Pete] Good. - I'm looking for the owner. - [Pete] Hi, Pete. - I'm Detective Todd Baris, this is Detective Donnelly. Does Brad Donnelly work here, he's a bartender here right? - Yeah he is, but he didn't show up for work. That's why I'm here. - What time does his shift usually end? - 2 AM, every night. He did go out a little early last night. - How come, (mumbling)? - No, no he didn't. - Is it possible he met a girl or something? - Yeah that's always possible with Brad, but, nah, I don't think so. He'd never let a chick come between him and his tip money. - Any of these girls work with him last night? - Uh yeah Connie over there. Uh, Melissa, right there. The one with the sweet ass. - Well uh, we're gonna need a list of all the employees that were on staff last night. - Oh absolutely. - [Jack] And uh, you have any video cameras or surveillance on the premises? - No nothing like that here man, it's old school, (mumbling), antique. Hey guys. Hey I know Brad does live with his family. His mom doesn't know where he is? - No, my wife doesn't know where he is. - Hey, I'm sorry man. Hey, hey I hope you find him, because Brad's a good kid. - Melissa? Hi, Todd Baris. - Ma'am, can I ask you a couple of questions? - Sure. - Do you know Brad Donnelly? - Yeah. (muttering) - So you haven't seen nothing out of the ordinary? - [Connie] No. - Just give me one second. (phone ringing) Yeah? All right, one second, hold on. If you hear anything or see anything please give me a call. Okay. We gotta get down there, - Can you handle it on your own? I'd like to stick around a little bit longer. - Yeah, okay. - All right. - All right, I got it, I'm on my way. - Can I get a Jack, neat. - [Pete] Hey, that's on me, okay? - Thanks Pete. (rock music) (chattering) - [Frank] Hey. - Hey, I thought you were gonna leave me all alone tonight. - [Frank] Get in. - All right. Whoo! - So uh, where are we going for coffee? - Well, there's a diner but I don't know if the coffee's that good. - All right. - Got any coffee at your place? - I do. - Let's go sailor. (foreboding music) (phone ringing) - Donnelly. What? Yeah I'm here. I'm on my way down. - [Connie] How long have you lived here? - [Frank] Oh, not very long. Here you go. - Thanks. Smells good. - So uh, I saw the police stop by the bar tonight. What did they want? - They're looking for Brad, he's missing. - Brad the bartender? - Playing coy is your not strong point Frank, change the subject. - Yeah Brad, he didn't make it home last night. One of those detectives at the bar was his father. I don't think they're that close, but, you know, his parents are divorced. - What did you tell 'em? - I don't know, he asked when I had last seen Brad. If I knew of any enemies he might have and, oh yeah, he asked who was at the bar last night. - He asked who was at the bar? - Yup, he asked me if I remembered if there was anyone unusual, if there was anyone that seemed suspicious. - Oh... And did you? - Frank, what are you a cop now? I told him it was just the regulars. - This doesn't sound good Frank, can we trust her? (foreboding music) - What is it, what's wrong? - You shouldn't have brought her here Frank, that was lazy, very, very lazy. - Yeah Frank, what were you thinking, ah, this place is such a dump. - And Officer Donnelly is waiting outside, ready to take Frankie Boy back to the big house. - Shut up. - Excuse me, Frank, what is wrong with you? - Yeah Frank, what the hell is wrong with you, don't tell her to shut up. - I wasn't talking to her. - In Frank's defense, I think he was talking to me. - Okay, I think it's time. I gotta go. - I'm sorry, don't go. Please don't go. - Please let go of my arm. - You don't think she's wearing a wire do you Frank? You know, working with those two detectives. - Oh Henry, our boy could be suspect number one. - What are you doing? Don't fucking touch me you fucking psycho. - How can you say that? I am not a psycho! (screaming) - That's no way to treat a lady Frank, not on the first date! (groaning) - Wow, I think he really likes this girl. (groaning) (snickers) (anticipatory music) (foreboding music) - Jack. He's handling it. They found his ID, his bag. - Where did they find him? - They found him down by the dump. - Let me see him Todd. - Nah-ah, (mumbling) in there Jack, there's something you gotta know, it's the way he was killed. It's the same MO of that John Doe we had the other night. And that guy Henry Benson. - Oh no... - [Todd] I'm so sorry Jack. We're gonna get this guy, Jack! We're gonna get this motherfucker, Jack! (coughing) (heaving) - Carol, we found him. (foreboding music) - What is it Connie, what's wrong? - I'm still angry about the way you treated me last night Frank. It was really rude. - I know and I said I was sorry about that. It's just these guys, they make a little nuts sometimes and I just lost it. - You need to take responsibility for your actions, Frank. - Yeah Frank, nobody told you to lift this chick's shirt up. No means no brother. - He's right you know. - I know he's right. Look I'm sorry. It's just not that easy without my pills. - Look at me buddy. Take a look at what you accomplished without those pills. You got a job, you got a girlfriend, you got friends, things are looking up. That all started when you got rid of those pills. - I know Charlie, I know you're right. - Of course I'm right, now go take out the trash. - I gotta get to work. - Oh, hey Frank. - [Frank] Hey. - You were up late last night. I mean you were up late working or something. - Yeah, yeah I really couldn't sleep. - Was it because of the fight you had with your girlfriend? - What? - Well I saw you coming in with that girl last night, I thought she was your girlfriend. I heard shouting or something, I figured you guys had some kind of fight. - No, no fight. - Oh, okay. Well, you know, I would never yell at you like that. - [Frank] I gotta go, I'm gonna be late for work. - You got a job? - Yeah. - Frank that's great! - I gotta go. - Oh hey wait, wait. Jose was her last night, he was looking for you. He said you have one more day to pay the rent or he's gonna throw you out. Frank, he looked serious. - [Frank] I gotta go. - Hey, if you ever need any help with anything... I can help you! (ominous music) (chattering) - Detective Donnelly. We got John Doe identified. - You did? - The fingerprints come back to a Charles Downey. Who was arrested for organizing an illegal card game about 10 years ago. Last known address (mumbling). Detective. My condolences. - John? Can I talk to you a minute? - Sure, come in Frank. - John I need to ask for an advance. - Go ahead, sit down. How much we're talking about here Frank? - Two months? - Two months, absolutely not. - John, I didn't pay my rent and I'm about to be evicted. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, but frankly this is not my problem. You haven't even worked here for a week. No way. - John, please, I really need this money, I can't lose my place, I made friends there. - Then work it out Frank. This is a personal problem. I'm short on guys there, I need you to get back to work. Get back to work! (serene music) - Hey John, I'm going to Vinny's, do you want anything? - [John] Nah I'm all right, I'm good. - Okay, no problem. (phone keypad dialing) - [John] Hey Steve, yeah it's John. Uh listen, where did you put those (mumbling) last night? Oh they're in (mumbling)? All right, all right. (serene music) - [Voiceover] John I need to ask for an advance. - [Voiceover] Two months, absolutely not. - I needed that fucking money. - [Voiceover] Well I'm sorry to hear that, but frankly this is not my problem. - [Voiceover] John I really need this money, I can't get thrown out. I made friends there. - [Voiceover] Then work it out, this is a personal problem. I'm short on guys there, I need you to get back to work. (serene music) (chattering) - Hey Jack. Jack! - I just don't get it. There's absolutely no connection between any of 'em. No pattern. What's the motive here? - Why don't you go and get some sleep? It's been a long day. - I can't sleep! My only son is dead. - Frank, just sit down. Let me help you out man. I hear you IDed that John Doe? - Yeah. Guy goes by the name of Charles Downey. I stopped by his apartment, but he lived alone. No traces of family, and the neighbors haven't seen him in a week. - What did he do for a living? - Nothing. He was on disability. - What's a guy on disability do all day? Gimme that picture. All right, come on. Let's go back to that bar. (anticipatory rock music) - [Connie] What is it honey what's wrong? - [Frank] We're leaving. - Why aren't you at work? - [Frank] We're leaving Henry. - You just started this job and you're already resigning? You know how this is gonna look employment record? - Frankly Henry I don't give a shit what this is gonna look like on my employment record. - Oh Frankie boy, what did you do? (door knocking) (ominous music) - [Beth] Frank, it's Beth. Are you in trouble? - Yes. - When I saw you coming in all covered in blood I knew you were in trouble, I just knew it! What happened Frank? - I just murdered my boss. - Did he deserve it? - Did he deserve it? No, probably not. - What are you gonna do? - We're leaving town. - We're leaving? - (laughs) You better watch it Frank. Looks like she's got a little crush on ya. - Who is this bitch again? - Not you Beth. - [Charlie] Oh, we can bring her, can't we? She understands you Frank. - No Charlie we can't bring her. - Who's Charlie? - He's just one of the faces. - The faces? (door knocking) - [Jose] Frank, Frank Walker open this door right now and pay me my money or get the fuck out. - I wanted to give this to you. In case it'll help. (door knocking) - Jose I uh, I don't have all that money I owe you, but I do have some cash. Maybe it'll buy me some time until I get paid next week? - Okay Frank, let me see what you got. Open up. (anticipatory music) 200, 200 fucking dollars? Pack your shit and get the fuck out! - Jose what are you doing? - What I should have done a long time ago! Let's go! - [Beth] Jose let go of him! - [Jose] What the fuck? This isn't your blood. (scuffling) I'm getting my money one way or the other! (foreboding music) - [Todd] Pete. - [Pete] Hey guys, oh. - Do you know this guy? - [Pete] Yeah that's uh, yeah that's Charlie, he's one of the regulars. - When was the last time you saw him? - Well it's been about a week I guess. That's pretty strange because he usually comes in every afternoon and closes the joint. - Any friends you know of? - Nah, nah Charlie was kind of ass, you know, typical ballbuster. He'd usually latch on to people in the bar, but nobody really liked him. - That's great. Okay Pete, thanks. - Hey guys, whenever you're out there looking for missing persons, maybe you can find my bartender? She didn't show up for work today either. - Which barmaid didn't show up? - Connie you remember her, she's my best girl. - Who's that fella that was sitting there alone at the bar the other night? - I'm not sure who you mean. - Well he's got a beard. Baseball hat. - Oh that's Frankie the freak. - The freak? - [Pete] Yeah. - Why do you call him the freak? - Ah you know, Frankie would say some pretty strange shit to the girls sometimes, you know, and Charlie always busted his chops over it. You know the rumor was he was locked up for a while, I'm not sure if it was the funny farm or general purpose. Definitely one strange dude. - I saw Connie getting in his car late last night. - Really? She hated that guy. - Pete, do you have a last name, an address, anything? - I got nothing like that man. I mean I know he lives close by because he stumbles home after his drink (mumbling). Sorry guys. - [Voiceover] The victim has been identified as John Le Bruno of Jersey City. The police department is reaching out the public to help catch the killer. If you can identify the man in this still photo-- - Holy shit that's Frank! - [Voiceover] Reach out to the police at the number on your screen, he's considered armed and extremely dangerous. - Yeah (mumbling), Doyle, okay put me through to him. Hey Joe, it's Todd Baris. What do you got? They're going over the employee files now, everybody checks out except for three guys. - Let's see if one of those guys is Frank. - Yeah Joe. I may have a suspect for this, is one of those guys named Frank? Yeah, Walker, Frank Walker. Uhuh, gimme the address. Good, thanks. Come on let's go. (car engine revving) (anticipatory music) PC23, we have a suspect in the warehouse homicide, we're en-route to his last known location, 20 Bellevue Street. (police radio chattering) (scuffling) - [Jose] You're a no-good piece of shit Frank Walker! (grunting) (screaming) (groaning) You fucking bitch! (neck snapping) (groaning) (ominous music) - At first I didn't like her, but she turned out to be pretty nice. - That was one tough lady Frank. Not a lot of women care that much about their men, Frank. - She proved to be reliable, loyal. Great attributes. - Ah, we can't leave her like that, Frank. She's one of us! (ax thumping) - [Voiceover] We at Fax News have exclusive video of the shocking attack, caught on surveillance camera. The attacker can be seen entering the office and having a conversation with the manager. The suspect then leaves, only to return moments later armed with an ax, violently striking his victim multiple times. We have removed that portion of the video. He then slowly exits the office covered in the victim's blood. The victim has been identified as John Le Bruno of Jersey City.
