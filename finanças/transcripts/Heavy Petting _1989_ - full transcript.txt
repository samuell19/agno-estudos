[music playing] -There was kissing, with your mouth closed, arm around, kissing with your mouth open, and French kissing. Um, feeling the girls' breasts with the bra on, then with the bra off. And then beyond that, kind of all hell broke loose. It was kind of-- [laughing] if you want to feel somebody's genitals, or if the girl felt yours, or you felt hers, or whatever, then it was just like, you were getting beyond that bases, I think, by then. The steps didn't have-- they didn't go in order anymore. [MUSIC - SHIRELLES, "DEDICATED TO THE ONE I LOVE"] -Why don't you leave it on? -That's a pretty good arrangement. Whose is it? -Who cares? -I like the way they use the [inaudible]. -Uh huh. -We should get some, I mean the combo. Gene-- [MUSIC - SHIRELLES, "DEDICATED TO THE ONE I LOVE"] NARRATOR: There are two very important words in every rule. And those two words are do and don't. You've heard mothers say, do have a piece of candy. You'll like it. -Take some of this nice, big-- NARRATOR: Do gave you something that was good. Then you've heard Mother say, don't touch the hot stove, or you'll burn yourself. Don't kept you from hurting yourself. -I don't like bacon. NARRATOR: And remember this. Don't do a don't. -It's delicious. NARRATOR: Do do a do. -I don't like delicious. NARRATOR: Don't do a don't. Do do a do. That's kind of fun to say. [MUSIC - MARILYN MONROE, "THAT OLD BLACK MAGIC"] -I remember this story where I was five years old, and I thought that I had had sex. Because I was quite sure that I'd had sex, even though I had no idea what sex was. [music playing] FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): I was in a play. I had on this great big full skirt. I was looking out into the audience. I was looking for my little boyfriend, little Dougie Aderold. I couldn't see him anywhere. And I had forgotten my line. I looked down at my shoes. I looked down through the cracks of the platform, the raised platform of the stage. And I could see the face of little Dougie Aderold who was looking up my skirt. So I went [gasp]. I sort of jumped. And then I kind of got into it a little bit. [music playing] -And I saw. And I knew little Dougie Aderold was underneath there. And I didn't move out of the way. So I got this sudden, wild flush, sort of rush. And I had decided that I had had sex, or that was sex, that sort of weird feeling. I knew I was doing something bad. -He was like a really bratty kid, and really pushed me around. And he wanted to give me a shot in my butt. [laughing] And I really, really didn't want him to do it. [laughing] He insisted. So I pull my pants down. And we have one of those little doctors kits. And he gives me shot in my butt. And it, you know, it was actually kind of a pleasant experience. But he also said if he couldn't give me the shot in the butt, then I couldn't have a fudgicle. So I really wanted a fudgicle. So I said, all right. You can do it. NARRATOR: Little fellas, big gloves, and the finals of the Navy junior boxing bouts at Annapolis. Only it's quickly apparent that one little champer doesn't know what to do. He was told. But, shucks, he forgot. There's only one thing to do, ask Dad. He knows. Father says, quote, they can't do that to us. Get back in there and paste him one, unquote. Cheer up, sonny. Next year I bet you'll knock his block off. So don't give up the ship. The navy expects every man to do his duty. -Did your father or mother ever tell you about the birds and the bees? -Oh no. No, no, no. My father would have been entirely embarrassed to say anything. There was no talk to me about sex at all. -Your mother? -Later, much later. -Health and physical education cover a great many subjects. So what would you girls like to discuss? -Boys. [laughter] -All right now, Meg. What do you want to know about the subject? -Everything. [giggling] -My brother and I couldn't have cared less. I mean, we'd kind of listen. But we would be laughing. Every time she said penis, we'd break up into squeals of laughter. And she got really mad at us. Because we would never pay attention. We were like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, OK. Let's go watch "Bullwinkle." -The only pornographic book we got was the Sears and Roebuck catalog, with the underwear ads. That was about it. And then they had one sex manual. And the language was almost incomprehensible. It was so antiquated. There was the word like the pubis, and the dubis-- words that I can't even remember. Like I would be going through it, and saying, what is that? What are they talking about? [MUSIC - FATS DOMINO, "BLUBERRY HILL"] -Hi, duchess. -Hi. -What's the matter with her? -Oh, she's just growing up, dear. -Janie, when do you think I'll start having periods, too? -I was 13 when I started. FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Well, Peggy's already started hers, and I'm six months older than she is. -Well, so what? Some start earlier, some later. From the way you've been acting lately, it shouldn't be long now. [MUSIC - FATS DOMINO, "BLUEBERRY HILL"] NARRATOR: Bob was growing up, too. He knew about the reproductive organs and masturbation. But he'd read that the problem was more mental than physical. He could take girls in his stride, just as he did games. Until one day, when Bob was 16, it became apparent that his interest in girls was getting to be more than casual. MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): I had pinups. I hid them behind the door. But one day my mother opened the door, and found-- it was the classic Marilyn Monroe. It was good old airbrush jobs. It was nothing like we have today in "Hustler." It was Marilyn Monroe stretched out on that red velvet-- I remember that one-- in color. And she took them all down without me knowing it, and took them down to the sun room, and laid them out on the coffee table, and invited me in. And she sat down. And she said-- she pointed at them and says-- said something to the effect that these give you disturbing thoughts and bad ideas. [music playing] -A major factor that makes youngsters prime targets for this printed filth is the natural curiosity of youth about the mysterious force of sex. These highly colorful magazines picture stark nudity on slick paper. They often present their subject on bed or couch, obviously calculated to stimulate the reader. For the sake of decency in this film, we have partially covered the pictures, and disguise the identity of the models. But actually, these magazines not only display complete nudity, they do so in a perverted manner. We know that once a person is perverted, it is practically impossible for that person to adjust to normal attitudes in regard to sex. The insatiable curiosity of youth will cause him delve deeper and deeper until his utter depravity is complete. [music playing] -You all know what sperm is? -Yeah, it's a guys' part of a baby, isn't it? FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): That's right. -Does an erection-- well, does that mean you have too much sperm, and you ought to get rid of it? -No. But sometimes your body will do that by itself at night. It's called a nocturnal emission, or wet dream. Then you can cause an ejaculation by yourself too, by masturbating, rubbing the penis. -I was never good at it for a long time. In high school-- I remember in camp everybody was talking about it. And I'm, well, how do you do it? And it's, well, you go like this. Like that? That's about right, Judd. And in the tent we-- all the guys, of course, they said, OK, well let's do it. And so about seven guys were going-- [grunts]. And one guy, Michael, could-- he would do it, and ejaculate. But I never could. I mean, I was just flogging away there. When I got into college I got the hang of it, I think. And the rest is history. But in high school I never could do it. I had heard about it. It seemed mysterious and amazing to me. -A friend of mine had alerted me to the fact that something was going on. Because I remember him saying to me, once out of the clear blue, saying, if you take a piece of animal fur and rub your-- I think he was calling it then a dick-- if you rub your dick real fast, it will feel good. And I thought this was curious. It sounded really perverse. I didn't have any animal fur around the house. But looking back on it, I remember a lot of Davy Crockett hats. They were really popular then. I wonder, I'm wondering, thinking back on it, whether those were used for that. -I never thought you'd go blind. But I thought that maybe you wouldn't be able to get it up when you were with a girl, or that you only had a certain amount in you. And if you used it up when you were, wherever, 13 or 14, then you'd be dry by the time you were 18. And those things seemed somehow plausible. Whereas going blind, or going crazy didn't seem very plausible. NARRATOR: About this time, Mary developed a sudden strong friendship with Lucille Williams. They had absolutely no secrets from each other. To Mary's mother, it seemed unnatural, this concentration of affection on one girl. -Oh Lucille, wait a minute. You know what she's like. -Mary, darling, you're keeping Lucille from her dinner. -Oh, I was just leaving, Mrs. Gibbs. FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): I didn't kiss a boy until I was 14 or 15. But my girlfriends and I practiced kissing each other all the time. It was never like, you be the boy and I'll be the girl. But it was definitely, OK, well, let's do this. And then we would practice different lip tongue manipulations. [laughing] NARRATOR: Johnny and Janie, who are past childhood, are not yet quite grown into manhood and womanhood. They are in between. FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Actually, one football game, people began to tackle me. And I remember thinking, hmm, this is distinctly different. And my big sister watched. I don't know how she watched. I don't remember her watching. But she told me that she didn't think I should play anymore. -Hey, mom, where's my purple sweater? -Doris, for heaven's sake, don't shout. -Oh, I'm sorry, dad. But I just wanted-- -How many times have I told you not to walk around the house like that? -But dad, it's only a slip! -You heard what I said! Now go upstairs and put something on. -But dad. [gasp] [dramatic music] -What happened? -I hit her. -I know. But why? -I don't know. -Excuse me. Can I talk to you while you're jumping? -Yes. -What's your name? -Mary Jane Stebons. I understand you're the champion around here. How did you do it, and where did you do it, and how many times? Tell me all about it. -I did it in my neighbor's backyard, and I did it 6,201 times. -6,201 times. -Yes. -Without stopping? -Yes. -How long did it take you, Mary Jane? -Almost an hour. -And why did you stop? You were completely tired, or what? -Well, my pogo stick ran out of grease. And I was tired. MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): I was interested in girls, sort of. I remember walking home the two books from school once. I was really young and naive. And there was one girl that had just gone through puberty, and big breasts. And I said, gee, you've got big breasts. And she got really mad. And she hit me, and chased me down the street. And I was just-- inquiring sort of. She really got outraged that I had dared mention it. I was just an innocent joke. Or it wasn't even a joke. I was just blurting out. I remember she chased me, and hit me with her book bag, school book bag. So I think I didn't have much to do with women after that. [music playing] -Oh boy, a party! A real party, for a change. Hey. -Let's go together, Cindy. -Well, how do you know somebody isn't going to ask to take you. -Oh, golly, I'd be scared to death. Maybe we better go together, Cindy. -I didn't go on any dates. I don't think I've ever been on a date in my life. I know somebody once took me somewhere by accident. I didn't know what I was getting into. And I think it was a date. But I don't know. Because I never had anything to compare it to. -Hi. -Hello, there. -Hi, Kathy. -Hi. -You know her? -Just well enough to be politely turned down when I ask her for a date. -Yeah, me too. -Well, I was thinking of giving it one more try. I think I'll ask her to the dance next Saturday night. -Well, you better hurry up. She's leaving. -I'll be right back. -Hi. -Hi, Rick. -How's your tooth? -My tooth? -Yeah. Remember a couple weeks ago I asked you for a date, and you had a toothache? -Oh yes. -Well, how is your tooth? -Oh, it's better, thanks. -Oh, well, that's good. -75, a dollar. Thank you. -Thank you. -Well, it's been nice talking to you. Bye, Rick. -It was OK to walk up to a girl that you didn't known and begin talking to her. But it was terrifying. It was a hard job for you, not for her. [music playing] [music playing] MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Before you actually asked anybody anything you'd ask their friend if she likes you, if she maybe she likes you, or could she like you. And she would maybe do the same thing. And it would just be all these queries going on, this whole network of feeling each other out. Who is maybe interested in who? Or no way they're interested in you. And it's kind of without actually sticking your neck out, and getting it chopped off, you can find out the kind of pecking order. -I want to go up and ask Rick to be your date next Saturday night. -But Connie, I don't even know him. -So introduce yourself. -Excuse me. -Well, hello. -Hello. -What do you want? -I came over here to talk to him, not you. I'd like to invite you to a party Saturday night as my date. -He's busy Saturday night, baby. -You got a date, kid. -Hey, wait a minute. -Shut up. What's your name? -I killed girls who messed around with my boyfriend. No, seriously. NARRATOR: The dancing hasn't worked out as Margaret hoped. But it's foolish to b jealous. It's your own fun you're spoiling. FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): I think I was fairly terrified of guys in a romantic context. Although I really wanted to, to have a boyfriends. In junior high school I never went out. I think this had a lot to do with the fact that I had no breasts. Some girls did. All the cheerleaders had breasts, except Sharon Tremley. She didn't have any. But she had long blonde hair, and that's OK. -Hi, Mary. How about going to the dance with me Saturday night? -Well, I'll think about it. -Hey, wait a minute. What about me? -You didn't ask me. -Well, I was going to. -But you didn't, though. Jim got there first. OK, Jim. -Good. See you around. -I remember this kid came into school, Peter Lang. And all the girls went, [gasping] can you believe it? He's so good looking! God, a good looking guy in our class. What do you mean? What do you mean, he's good looking? What's wrong with us? I mean we're-- oh, none of you guys are good looking. What? Can you imagine such behavior? I mean-- NARRATOR: Yes indeed. Both Don and Sue look like the kind of people you'd like to know, don't they? Of course, right now they're dressed for their Friday date. But don't you have the feeling that they're always well groomed? NARRATOR: All through the day, others are looking at you. NARRATOR: Fellows like to see girls dressed up. -Hi. I've seen you before. NARRATOR: Don's all set to look right at school, isn't he? NARRATOR: Good enough in that outfit. For Don and Sue, the question "how do I look" depends on good grooming habits. [music playing] -It's been marvellous. And I'm so thrilled now I just am speechless. -OK, a really nice one was called a biscuit. Or like if they're young they'd be called like a twinkie or a cracker. But if you're not too attractive, it would be like a dumpling. -Hi, Helen. Gee, you look nice. -Well, thank you. Do you like my new dress? -Yeah. -Well, come on in. -You were supposed to have a smile kind of plastered on your face, which I had really because of my hairdo more than anything else. It was like one of those ponytails that's pulled straight back, and keeps the mouth from moving. -I thought all girls wanted fellows to take them to fancy places, and spend lots of money. -Not this girl. -You know, I sort of like things like this, too. You won't laugh? I like to go on bicycle trips, too. Do you? -Mhmm. And miniature golf. Do you like that? -Say, Kay, next Friday there's going to be a weenie roast. Or there will be a bowling party, if you'd rather do that. Or we can go to the band concert. -Oh, I'd enjoy going to the weenie roast very much. Unless you'd rather go bowling. -No, I'd rather go to the weenie roast. [music playing] MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): I'd go to the dance and act like a moron, and turn everybody off. A big joke was you'd dance with a girl, and you'd go, vertebrae, vertebrae, vertebrae, verte-bra, vertebrae, vertebrae, things like that. [music playing] -One time at a junior high school dance, I had spent the whole week getting ready for it. And I bought this little outfit, and the whole bit. And when my parents came to pick me up, I was in tears, and just crying. Because no one had danced with me. Not one person even asked me to dance. NARRATOR: And now the end of a perfect evening. -Don't! Please! FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): If you were going to see a young man again, you would certainly kiss him good night, whether or not you had any sexual intentions toward him. If you didn't kiss him at any other time except when you kissed him good night, it indicated a certain imitation of relationship. If you stood there a long time, and got all sweated up, it indicated that maybe next time one would go further. NARRATOR: Or it could go this way. -Well, so long. NARRATOR: Just like that. After all, a girl likes to know you've had a good time. -I think I made every error you can make on a date. I stepped in dog shit on a first date with someone. I thought that was tremendously uncool. And I was wearing sandals. And I got hit with pigeon droppings on one date. One date, I turned her off. I had asked her to go to see a Gilbert and Sullivan show at Dalton. And we went. And I told her that she was my second choice, that my first choice couldn't make it that night. And she just turned right off to me. And I didn't know why honesty was so unrewarded. No, I wasn't head of the dating team. -I remember it came to a kind of climax one day when I burst into years, after about half a year, and said, nobody loves me. Well, I actually wept, nobody loves me, felt that lonesome. And that was really a great discovery, that that's what I actually felt. You know, really-- -If you did. -If I did, yes, I thought I did, anyway that I was capable of that, of saying that really amazed me. Because that was really making myself totally vulnerable for somebody. Actually, I still feel that way. Nobody loves me. -Want to be loved? -Well, that I don't know. -Yeah, I want to be loved on my own terms. -General dating, for me anyway, was restricted to picking up girls. I would date a girl. And we'd have fun. With could go for a nice, impromptu date. And then probably never call her again. [music playing] -Arthur. -Hey, Johnny, where are we going? -Let's get gas. [honking] -Jeepers! He's so cool. -Sally, I'm not changing my mind. FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Please, Dad. MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): You're not going, and that's final. I'm doing what I know is best for you. You've got to believe that. Your safety comes first. [music playing] -This same type of rot and decay caused 16 of the 19 major civilizations to vanish from the earth. Magnificent Egypt, classical Greece, imperial Rome all crumbled away-- not because of the strength of the aggressors, but because of moral decay from within. -Jiggy. Just hold on. What is this, the officers' club, or something? I don't want to catch any of you smoking in here again, you understand? Now get out. Come on. You heard what I said. Get out. What's the matter? You two guys privileged characters, or something? -You only just got here, chief. -Hey there now, I know, just get out. -Can't a man wash his hands, chief? -Wash them and get out. -Sure, chief. -You going to watch me? -Maybe you'd like to wash them for us. -What's your name? Yeah, I'm talking to you. -Me? -Yes, you. -That anarchistic, go for broke, hell raising personality has always been a rather attractive one in my book. -You had to roll your shoulder to the left. And you have to kind of hug your steering wheel, and kind of give this, like a sneer or a sexy look. The girls used to think it was great. So we did it. MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): There is quite a group of people don't sort of approve of the thing you do. They seem to think that contributes to juvenile delinquency, and all sorts of things. Have you given any thoughts to the unpopular side of your audience? [GIRLS SCREAMING AND MUSIC - ELVIS, "MY BABY LEFT ME"] MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): What about cleaning it up, or at least improving it morally, maybe taking the wiggle out of it. -Well, sir, you take the wiggle out of it, it's finished. MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Have you have any incidents-- MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Why is that? -Well, rock and roll music, if you like it, and if you feel it, you can't help but move to it. That's what happens to me. I, I can't help it. I have to move around. I can't stand still. I've tried it. And I can't do it. MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): I believe with all of my heart that rock and roll music is a contributing factor to our juvenile delinquency of today. Why I believe that is because I know how it feels when you sing it. I know what it does to you. And I know the evil feeling that you feel when you sing it. Thank God there's people today that will stand up and cloud against it. Thank God there people today that are filled with the fear of God that will stand up and say it's wrong, it's sin. But you, teenager, you're engulfed in it. You're soaked. You're pulled down. You're trampled on. You're forsaken by the devil. [music playing] MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): You like music yourself, Mayor? MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): I love music, and I love to dance, too. However, we feel this rock and roll rhythm is filled with dynamite. And we don't want dynamite to go off in the stadium in Jersey City. [MUSIC - "ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK"] -What do you think of the mayor of Jersey City? -I think he's a square, man. He don't know what's happening, that's all. Because rock and roll is cool, you know? -Yeah, I see. -I think that mayor must have been nowhere. Because rock and roll is cool, Daddy, and you know it. -Rock and roll is the most. And if they stop that, they ain't going to have no more music. -That music sends me, man. It sends me. I dig that music all the way. [MUSIC - THURSTON HARRIS, "LITTLE BITTY PRETTY ONE"] NARRATOR: Horses like to run. They're safe when they have a bit in their mouths. Children are safe when they obey the rules. [MUSIC - THURSTON HARRIS, "LITTLE BITTY PRETTY ONE"] -[whistling] Hi, Dad. Hi, Mom. -Hello, dear. -[whistling] Say, Dad, I was wondering if I could use the car after dinner. Some of the fellows want to go into town this afternoon. And I said I could probably get our car. Hear me, pop? -Yeah, sure, son. I won't be using it. -Thanks, pop. [MUSIC - THURSTON HARRIS, "LITTLE BITTY PRETTY ONE"] [tires screeching] [MUSIC - THURSTON HARRIS, "LITTLE BITTY PRETTY ONE"] MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): In our day, cruising meant going up and down, driving around, seeing what young girls were around, and kind of catcall to them. If you owned the car, you always wanted to have a buddy along who was considered a good window man, a guy that could get a girl to talk. [MUSIC - THURSTON HARRIS, "LITTLE BITTY PRETTY ONE"] -The window man, I could say the exact same thing, word for word, that a good smooth operator could say. But it would never come out the same. The girl would just keep her eyes to the ground, and keep right on walking. MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Since when have you become so psychological? FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Oh, Roger, grow up. My, you look pretty. -Thank you, mother. -Joyce, you've got on too much lipstick. -No more than usual, dad. -Well, it's too much for a girl your age. I don't understand why you kids always try to act grown up. By the way, where are you going? FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): To a party. MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Why haven't you said something about it before this? -Mary, will you wear my school ring? -If a man could put his knee between your legs as you moved, and if you allowed your breasts to touch the man's chest as you danced, especially in a certain rhythm, and in a certain provocative manner, that was certainly a signal of sexuality. On the other hand, if he moved toward you, and you just ever so carefully moved away-- because the whole point of it was that it was a very slow dance-- you could get a great deal of information from the beginning to the end of that dance. And you could go through changes. You could be seduced. You could change your mind. The man, in the dance, was trying to make you change your mind if you were resisting. You were trying to resist. Because it was always better to resist. -Stop. -It's all right. -Oh, what's all right? If you think it's such an honor to wear this ring, then go find some girl who's willing to-- MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Well, Father Caridan, this is March 1, your going steady deadline. What's happened? -Glen, I think we've achieved the purpose that we started out for. MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): And did you speak to the students? -I definitely, personally. And of the 20 or 30 that were going steady, I've gotten their promise. Now of course, let's face it. Some children could lie. I don't say they're liars at all. But some could say they're not, and maybe they are. But the ones who are honest enough, they've broken it off. MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): And you think they'll actually keep their word? -Absolutely. -We used to have a dance, like twice every semester, or something. So this is the only chance we really had to meet the girls. So we would go to this dance. And the only-- whenever a slow song came was the only chance you really got to do anything. So here you are now, and a slow song comes on, what they would call in Jamaica like rub-a-dub, which means you're starting to get really close, and dancing. And the headmistress of the school, her name was Mrs. Parsons, or something. She eventually washed away in a hurricane. She used to come up to you. And as you got close to the girl, she would come up with this foot ruler and smack you, and take the foot ruler and measure between you and the girl. So you had to be at least one foot apart. -As long as a boy is a boy and a girl is a girl, and they have red blood in their veins, its morally very dangerous at this age to be keeping steady company. -I just keep remembering diagrams of heaven and hell, and purgatory in between, and these pictures of steps. And people walking up and down. And these weird concepts of being trapped in these diagrams. [music - "rockin' robin"] MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Has anything happened recently which prompted you to take- -Yes, there has happened something recently. When you think of two girls, 16, and 17 years of age that leave school in their junior and senior year, and they want to get married, then there's something definitely wrong. MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Well, is it just because they wanted to get married -They had to get married. -At that time I guess I was mixed up about what it took to get pregnant. I, I guess it's possible, but I would worry a lot that, well, let's see, if we did something like if we went skinny dipping together and I got a hard on, I'd worry that, what if I leak, or something? It could-- something could happen. And I guess those things are possible. But they're pretty unlikely. -Then there was the famous circle jerks of '51, where we all tried to fill up a milk bottle with sperm. You could not imagine how long that takes. -Usually grind around in the bedrooms until about five o'clock at night. And then clear out before mom and dad came home. And then go home to your house. And your mother says, what have you've been doing? And you say, you know, I had to stay late, or I was doing homework with Betsy, or something like that. And then go home, and that was it. And then you'd talk on the telephone for about seven or eight hours until midnight at night. And then go sleep, and get up and do it all over again. [chuckling] -Well, what about the problem of boys, their hands, you know? You get home from a date. And it's still enough to stay outside for a while to talk. Some talk. It's a funny thing. This boy has probably been good company on the date. But just give him half a chance alone, and there's just no stopping him. -Why don't we take some cases, starting with yours, Lucy, and show just how you can say no. -All right. Here we are on the front steps. -Tell me, what are you going out for in the track meet next Saturday? -Oh, the relays, I guess. -Oh, how wonderful. -My thing was to stick my hand up on her-- she had beautiful legs and thighs, and get my hand up inside of her Bermuda shorts. She wore those plaid madras Bermuda shorts then. They were popular in the late '50s. And then I wouldn't go any further. I think I was terrified to. I think once I did. And maybe I touched some pubic hair. I don' remember. It was really scary. And then I'd have my hand on her. And I'd be fully dressed. And then I would dry hump her. And I'd come in my Dungarees, and show her the spot. And then we'd go a vanilla Coke. FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Or take the case of the girl who finds herself in this situation. -Say, is anybody else hungry? How about it, you two? Couldn't we go someplace for something to eat? -You girls seem to think it's always the boy who starts things. -Well, naturally. FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Oh no, Lucy. I, well, sometimes we're partly to blame. We invite a little attention. It goes on. And then it's hard to stop. -There are times when it's up to the boy to say no. -Some fellows seem to think that petting's, well, the thing to do. -And some girls think that they have to commit it for date insurance. -Pet is such a bizarre word. I would pet. They would pet. You would pet. I don't know how to even use the verb, pet. But whatever it is, feel one another, whatever, I never had this drawing and quartering of one's body, and how much you give to Sam, and Bill, and Bob, and whatnot. -Well, each of us has to set his own standards, I guess. -[screaming] Get away! Oh! -One night I was in the den with my boyfriend. And we were groping around and dry humping. And suddenly I had an orgasm. And I didn't like it at all. And I remember I sat right up, and said, you have to go home right now. And he goes, why? Why? Why? Why? Why? I don't get it. And I go, you have to go home right now. That's all I kept saying. So he got up and went home. Here he was, my parents are gone. What's the big deal? And I went in the back room, and I said, Maggie, and I described the whole thing. And she goes, you must be mistaken. Girls cannot have orgasms. [music - "ready teddy"] MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): There you were, an explorer out on uncharted seas, hunting your way through the crinolines and the Maidenform bras. And finally, like all the great explorers of the centuries before, bare tit. Oh my God, this is incredible! This is like, wow! That took about three hours. And then about four days of fantasizing the maps in the room. -Put your arm around her, and try to work you arm over. And always afraid that she's going to-- not say something, but let out a yell in the middle of the movie theater, or something like that. And it was-- I don't know what it was such a big deal. But it was a big deal. You get your arm over her shoulder, and down around the other side. And your heart would be pounding a mile a minute. -They kiss you for as short a period of time as possible. And then they go for your tits. And then once they've grappled with your tits they go for that next plate. And they, of course, want you to touch their thing. And you usually resist. Because it's, you know, terrifying. And also, if you touch it, you know you're that much closer to, like, having to do it. -Jack, please don't do that. -Don't act like an iceberg all your life. Look, we love each other, don't we? -Yes, but after all-- -After all what? -Take me home. NARRATOR: Now Mary began to realize what her mother had meant all these years. Through her own experience, Mary was developing a sound ideal of what love should mean in her life. It was not what Jack offered. -Do you want to be loved? -Not really. It depends upon who or what. By my cat, certainly. -I don't understand, if you really love Keith, why you're not willing to love him all the way, completely. -Well, I may be old fashioned. But I've always been taught that sex relations should be saved for marriage. If I did give in to Keith, I don't think he'd ever respect me again, not to mention my own self-respect. -[scoffing] Self-respect isn't important when you're in love. -What about Keith's respect for me. I don't ever want to lose that. -Are you implying that Norm doesn't respect me? -I didn't say that. But I've seen it happen before. -I'm not worried about Norm. I know he respects me. [music playing] -Well, I just figure that since you met me at the Blue Dragon, that you just took it for granted that I'd had other boyfriends before you. -You had? -Yes, Poe, quite a few. -At that time, if a girl was suspected of sleeping with someone, going all the way, her reputation would be ruined. People would talk. And most of these, most of these stories would get propagated by-- or promoted-- by the fellows. And they were all notorious liars. -Yeah, we chugged a lot. If you could put down a quat bottle without taking your mouth off the bottle, that was very macho, very macho, yeah. That was your next three stories about sex would be believed. [laughing] [MUSIC - JOHNNY BURNETTE, "YOU'RE SIXTEEN"] -Mary, Mary, wait. MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Mary, is that you, dear? -Yes, mother. [MUSIC - JOHNNY BURNETTE, "YOU'RE SIXTEEN"] -Did you have a nice time, dear? -Very nice, thanks. -Well, you don't look much like a girl who's been out having a wonderful evening. -Oh, mom. -Now here. What's the matter, dear? -Do you remember when you told me that I might-- I might have such strong feelings about a boy that it might be hard for me to decide what's right to do? -Yes, I remember. Why? -It was something like that tonight with Jeff. The feeling between us kept getting stronger and stronger. On the way home we stopped and parked. And then things seemed to happen until we nearly-- it was so close. -I think with probably one exception in my high school, all the women were virgins. And I think all but maybe one or two of the boys were virgins, too. I was against this virginity stuff. I was in favor of promiscuity in a big way. But for some reason it just never happened. -There was only maybe one or two bad girls in school. And we didn't really know what exactly they did. -Cliff, what? -I was down in the park the other night, Annie. You ever go there anymore? -Oh, yeah. I have to walk through on my way to the library. -Funny feeling, isn't it? I lie awake nights, remembering. -You-you, you've got to go. -Annie, please, don't shut me out anymore. Please. If I could just see you sometimes. -Now, Cliff. [dramatic music] -When they talk about each other, who's a slut, who isn't a slut? I mean that was always the big topic. -They weren't in my school. They just weren't, unfortunately. We searched for them. But-- -No, it's impossible to be a bad boy in those terms. No, all boys are bad. Some girls are good. Some girls are bad. [music playing] MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): There was sort of a thing where people would get drunk, and then initiate their sexuality. It happened with me in a similar way, where I was out in the woods in the middle of the night. And I imbibed who knows and how many disgusting bottles of apple wine, or something. And with someone I didn't know at all, and it was out there foraging in the leaves for this crevice that I knew was supposed to be hidden there. And finally, after a great deal of difficulty, found it. And then had a lot of trouble with my own manhood. -Fumbling, fumbling with the back strap, the thing on the back. It's like, come on. It's like, give me James Bond who can just do it like that. He's trying to figure out which way the hook goes. -I remember thinking, so this is it. You were kind of led to expect something. And it's the first time-- maybe it's true for everyone. It's always a little bit of a letdown, I guess. [music playing] -Say, Nicky? -Yeah? -You know those girls in the city the other night? -Yeah. -You think they might have had something? -You bet they did. -Oh, oh you mean-- no, just forget about it, buddy. They're just a couple of good kids who want to have a little fun. -Well, I don't know, Nicky. Something happened. -What do you mean something happened? -Well, I've got some sort of sore down there. -Well, don't worry about it. It's probably just a pimple or something. The same thing happened to me, and it cleared up all by itself. [dramatic music] -Syphilis? -No, you didn't get syphilis from a toilet seat, Bill. You got it from sexual intercourse with somebody who had it. Now her name is? -Her name's Betty. -Her name was Mary. -His name is Jack. -Susan. -Roberta. -Bob. -Joanne. -All right, Tom. Who else? -Nobody, just them. Just, just them and some girl at the ballpark. I didn't even catch her name. -Where does she live? -Who knows. It was a night game. We never get out of the park. She really gave me the come on, and her a foot taller than me. Oh, she had sort light blonde hair. NARRATOR: Starting with a known hangout, the ball park, with only a vague description of a girl, the field representative tries to find one of the known contacts of an infected person. And here, as with all other cases in Oakdale, he is successful in locating a potential source of syphilis-- the tall, aggressive blonde. -I'm beginning to see what we're up against, the same old mistakes, over and over again. What are we going to do put young men wise? -I can show you one of the answers to that question, if you have a little time to spare. -I'm right with you, doctor. MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): If you're smart, you keep away from prostitutes and pickups. They're not safe. And they can't be made safe. Use a rubber. The idea of a rubber is to keep the germs of syphilis and gonorrhea from getting from one person to another. You see, germs can enter your body very easily at this moist, tender spot here, and where there may be scratches or breaks, especially here. The rubber protects these areas. Put it on carefully. Roll the rubber down the penis with one hand. Hold half an inch of the tip with the other so that no air stays in it. Otherwise, it might break in intercourse. Use a full length rubber. Shorts are no good. MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): If she tells you she doesn't want to use a rubber, she's up to no good. If she's afraid it might come off, and get inside her someplace so that she'll need an operation to get it out, she's just crazy. Even if you tried, you couldn't force it inside any place where it could do harm. So don't let any woman talk you out of using one. -With a girl who had been around, who was not quite innocent, you had better have one. Or otherwise, it was no go. No go. But most of the fellows, well, they didn't even know how to put them on. -Oh, yeah. One of my best girlfriends in high school got pregnant, though she never admitted it to me. She got huge. And we shared a boyfriend, actually. And she never admitted to me that she was pregnant, nor did she admit to anyone else. And suddenly her brother adopted a child. And I never asked her. [MUSIC - HANK BALLARD & MIDNIGHTERS, "ANNIE HAD A BABY"] -My mother gave me a church tract called "Parking and Petting," which we read. And after I read it, she said to me that she would actually prefer for me to get run over by a car then she would for me to get pregnant. -Gee, I haven't seen her since she left school. FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): My mother learned that I was pregnant. And it was unthinkable to her. I mean, there were some kind of people somewhere that did such things. But it was really inconceivable to her that I could have done such a thing. -She called us on the phone. We were together at Julian's house. And she said, Julian and Judith, I want you to get on the extensions. I want to talk to you both at the same time. We got on the phone. She sounded very grave. She said the gas in the stove is now on. The windows are closed in my house here. And I am not going to open the windows. And I'm not going to turn off the gas until you tell me that you're going to get married. NARRATOR: Mothers and dads use more don'ts than they do dos, because they do want you to be safe in everything you do. It makes them happy when I do what they tell me to do. I will do things they want. -I suppose you want me to say I'm sorry. -Sooner or later, it was bound to happen. -It was just that I'm attracted to you. I just got carried away. -I couldn't stand to have it happen like that. NARRATOR: Don't do a don't. -That's why waiting is so important to me. NARRATOR: Do do a do. -But how can we stand to wait two or three years? -Please, Roger. Don't be too harsh. -Come here, young lady! -I'm sorry I'm so late. -Where have you been? -To the party. I didn't realize it was so late. I-I'm sorry. -You're sorry? You're sorry? We've been up all night. Your mother's worried to death about you. And all you can say is, I'm sorry. I don't know anything anymore, except you're absolutely and completely out of control! MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Captain Fulsom, can you tell me what brought about the riots in downtown Daytona Beach last night? MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): We had a couple of hot rods drag racing down Main Street. -Is that time the fire department was called in to try and keep the crowd back with hoses? -No, they were called only a couple hours later. -A couple hours later. About what time this morning did you get the situation under control? -About 4:20 this morning. -You have to go all the way up together. Get your cars. Bring them up on the right hand side. Take his car and flip out the left-hand side. Hurry up. Turn your lights toward the center. Hurry up. Get going. -You OK? -Give me some dirt. [tires squealing] -Chief Linderman, what's brought about this curfew? -With the number of problems we have had for the past two years with juvenile gangs loitering about in the streets, in parks, public places, in other areas of the community, and we're unable to cope with the situation. Instead of decreasing, it increased. -From now on, young lady, you're on a strict schedule. Homework after dinner, in bed at 10:00. And on weekends you have to be in at 12:00. We have to know where you're going, and with whom. -No. -No? And what does that mean? -Well, I think that it's a little childish to treat us like two-year-olds, really. The more restrictions that they put on us, the more we're just going to revolt against it. Because it's, it's not good at all. I don't go for it. -It's not a place for kids. -A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks. -He said a little drink. -You're tearing me apart. -What? -You think nine o'clock is too early to be in your house? -Sure. I mean, on a weekend what else is there to do? There's nothing else to do. So we've got to go out. When you were a kid did you go home at nine o'clock, huh? [laughter] -Why can't I dance in my town? I just want to dance! You know. [MUSIC - THE COUNTOURS, "DO YOU LOVE ME?"] -Troubles, Jim? -How about that Ricky? She's supposed to be in love with me, and she won't even wear my class ring. -What's going on? [MUSIC - THE COUNTOURS, "DO YOU LOVE ME?"] -You're a guy. You know what I think. -The devil's got his hooks in you, pulling you down. NARRATOR: This moral decay weakens our resistance to the onslaught of the Communist masters of deceit. [MUSIC - THE COUNTOURS, "DO YOU LOVE ME?"] NARRATOR: The question is this. Do you want your children stimulated, and driven into an early, unstable marriage? Do you want them to lose all chance of a normal, happy, married life? Of course you would not. We must make our land, the land of the free, a safe home. Oh God, deliver us, America, from evil. -You're too young to be running around in cars at night with girls. -I never get to do anything the other kids do. -That's right. Sorry, Mary. I'm afraid the answer has to be no. -I just knew it. No one in this family wants me to have any fun at all. I wish I were dead. -Why, I hope Jeff doesn't feel that he has the right to take liberties. -Oh, mother. -Steve, your breakfast. [phone ringing] -Hello? -Hi, Anne. What you doing Saturday night? FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): What do you want to do? MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Well, Stan owns a nice little resort about 60 miles from here. -I'll have to talk to my folks about it. But I think I can go. -Hello, Frank, listen. The family says no. But I'll sneak out tomorrow night, and meet you anyway. OK? Swell. See you tomorrow night. [phone ringing] [explosion] -So we said, please, open the windows. Turn off the gas. We will get married. [MUSIC - SHIRELLES, "DEDICATED TO THE ONE I LOVE"] FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Julian, of course, didn't believe in it. On the other hand, he was a very good, honorable man, a wonderful lover, and a marvelous father. So that even having to get married didn't spoil our relationship. [MUSIC - SHIRELLES, "DEDICATED TO THE ONE I LOVE"] -Oh! -What? -I think this time it ought to be different. -When you kiss somebody for serious, it's kind of scary, ain't it? -Yes. It is. [MUSIC - SHIRELLES, "DEDICATED TO THE ONE I LOVE"] [music playing] [MUSIC - RICKY NELSON, "I WANNA BE LOVED"] [cheering] [MUSIC - FATS DOMINO, "BLUEBERRY HILL"]
