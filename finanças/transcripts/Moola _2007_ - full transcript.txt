(box thudding) (cow mooing) - The deal with the Army, it's uncertain right now. Okay, it's on the rocks. Okay, you're right, it's dead. It's dead, but I've got so many ideas!

Thank you! - Hi, Jimmy Woo here, unassuming Asian self-made millionaire. Now when Jimmy Woo first come to this country he had nothing. Nothing, just the clothes on Jimmy Woo's back. Now Jimmy Woo's got it all! - Oh, Harry! Harry, I've got three phone numbers for you and I still can't reach you! Please call me we're having trouble with the supplier. Thanks. God, am I the only one working? Okay, honey, we gotta go. - [Jimmy Woo] You ladies ready for a martini? - So, have you thought about what you wanted to do this weekend? - Yeah, how about we unpack you? - What, already? - Dad, that's not funny, it's been six months. So, um, what's the deal with you and Mom? - We're separated, what do you mean? - Well, you're not gonna get back together, are you? - I don't know it's not that simple, we just-- - So are you allowed to sleep with other people? - Ashley, I'm not gonna talk about that with you. Why, is your mother-- - Bye, Dad. (school bell ringing) - Wait, wait, why, is your mother-- - Bye, Dad! - Okay. Hey, Ashley, one more thing. - Dad, you're driving me crazy. I am leaving now. - Alright, well, I just wanted to say that-- (crashing) (airbag hissing) (yelling) - Marion, I've been calling all morning and I keep getting this ringtone weird message. - Good morning, Steve. - Good morning. (Hector speaking foreign language) Hey, Hector. So? - Phone company said they never received payment, but I just bought us another couple of weeks. - Whew, how'd you do that? - I cried. - Yeah. - Okay, Mr. Steve, that should do it. - Hey, Hector don't you have that meeting with Compaq? - Your circuit board it got loose. - Oh, well, thank you, but I told you I can't pay you. - No, no, no, no charge. You've been really good to me. - I don't want you to go, it's just, they can actually give you money. (laughs) - (laughs) Also, about my download pre-emptor. - Yeah, oh, you're what? - Download pre-emptor. - Oh, your invention! Yeah, um, can I offer a little advice? Hector, I'd wait. I'd play it safe, get the job, don't mention it and then mention it later. - Thanks for your advice, Mr. Steve. - Yeah, you're welcome. (both coughing) Thanks, Hector, thank you. Okay, you better make your meeting. - Thank you. - Can you call triple A? I had a fender bender. - Oh, sure thing. Oh, I forgot to tell you, we are out of plastic. - Anything else you can use? Any other silver linings? - No. (tube bubbling) - Hello, Steven. - Hey, Wild Bill. What are you working on? - Oh, not sure. - Keep up the good work. - Okay. (sighing) - Oh, um, any messages? - Well, let me see. No. - Oh. (exhaling) - [Computer] You have no new email. - [Steve Voiceover] You're right, the deal with the Army, it's uncertain. Okay, you're right, it's dead, it's dead. Am I the only one working? (heart beating) - [Marion Voiceover] We are out of plastic. - [Steve Voiceover] I can't pay you. - [Ashley Voiceover] What's the deal with you and Mom? - [Steve Voiceover] We're separated, what do you mean? - [Ashley Voiceover] Are you allowed to sleep with other people? (tense music) (intercom beeping) - [Marian] Don't forget you have that appointment this morning. And you're late. I got a taxi for you. - Okay, thank you. (blues music) (helicopter whirring) - Greetings! - Good morning. - Greetings. - Good to see you. - Thanks for having us. - Thank you. - Good morning. Let me welcome you once again to AFI, Mr. Gordon, and to you, Mr. Watson. I know I speak for all of us here at AFI when I say how absolutely thrilled we are for this opportunity to be acquired by Gordon Technology Enterprises; the world leader in telecommunications, energy resources and, of course, after this deal, agribusiness. (clapping) - Thank you, J.T. When our purchase of AFI has been finalized and we assume the control of the market share your company has over bovine fertility then the final piece of that puzzle will be in place. This is a very good deal for all. - Unless, of course, you're June Cleaver worrying about the price of milk. (all chuckling softly) - I'd like everyone to hear from my head of legal. - Thank you, Gordon. This is a very substantial deal, one that will likely attract a lot of attention and perhaps even raise a few eyebrows. But the fact of the matter is, there's no denying that whoever controls the technology controls the industry and as fertility indicators go, well, AFI's the only game in town. (lively jazz music) - [Steve] Samantha Hardy? - You're late. - Sorry, my car died. I've never hired a business pro before. How would this work? - That depends. Look, I only have a few minutes here. I've reviewed everything you sent me. So why don't you tell me about these light sticks? - Okay, um, not much to tell, really. You bend a plastic tube and the chemicals mix and voila, light. - But do you have a patent? - Yeah, all the partners share in it, but yeah, we do. - So all those little glow things at Disneyland, they're yours? - Actually, we sold the rights for that use a few years ago. - That was stupid. - Thank you. - Alright, look here's how I see it. If you can't fix it, sell it. Normally buyers look at several things. First, there's EBIT, that's profit, you don't have any. Then there's earn out, that's potential, and you don't have any of that either. And then they look at cost to earnings ratio and-- - Wait, don't tell me. I don't have any of that either? - Bingo! But, you're lucky. You come to me, things happen, that's why I get my 5%. So, what do you say? - Well, I don't know. I mean, I have to talk to the other partners. - What are you, the class safety monitor? Come on, take charge. It's a slam dunk, no sale, no fee. - I just, uh... - Look, I know I'm putting a lot in front of you right now. And if you're afraid to make a move I understand. But, if you want something sometimes you just have to reach out and grab it. (tinkling) (Steve exhaling) Well, gee, this was fun. So, we have a deal. - Oh. (water splashing) - [Radio DJ] You're listening to 102.4 and that was your afternoon business report. Up next, news, weather and traffic. Right after a word from our sponsor. - [Jimmy] Hi, Jimmy Woo here, unassuming Asian self-made millionaire. - [Steve Voiceover] I have to talk to the other partners. - [Samantha Voiceover ] It's a slam dunk, no sale, no fee. Profit. - [Steve Voiceover] Don't tell me, I don't have any of that. - And look at me now. And look at you. Oh, man! You don't look so good, Steve! (gasping) Let me ask you a question, my friend. Where are you gonna be when your ship comes in, huh? At the train station? Don't miss your boat, Stevie. (laughs) - That should do it. That last one is the Letter of Intent. And Mr. Montgomery, we shall proceed with our due diligence and look forward to seeing you in 45 days when escrow closes. - Until then, J.T., no funny business. No money in, no money out. Bear in mind that this letter permits us to take a walk if anything should change. - I wouldn't have it any other way. - If anyone got wind of a takeover, if anything strange were to happen such as, let's say, your stock price were to shoot up, that would really vex me. - And you don't want to vex him. - No vex. Come on, Lu. Luis, it's me! - I look forward to welcoming you all into the family. - Because isn't family what it's all about? - Marion, any sign of Harry? Okay, well if you do, ask him to call me. Wait, uh, I gotta be at Nora's at four to pick up Ashley. What time is it? Oh, my God, I got 10 minutes, I promised her. Okay, yeah, alright, thanks, bye. (playful music) Oh, come on! (groaning) - What the hell, Louise? That's bullshit! Bullshit, that's bullshit! What, alright, alright, okay, let's calm down. So what do I get? Oh, oh, I get to keep my share of the business? Thank you very frickin' much! I'm the one who started this whole business! (telephone ringing) Shut up! Please hold. Yeah? - Harry, Harry, is that you? - I can't talk right now. - Where have you been, did you order the plastic? - Oh, the plastic. Well, gee, Steve, let me think. I've got a lot of things going on today. Like, my wife is leaving me and my whole life is being turned upside-down, thank you very much! - When did that happen? (telephone ringing) - It's happening right now, please hold. - Harry, it's me, Jonas. - I can't talk to you right now, Jonas. Louise is leaving me. - Yes, I know, that's why I'm calling. - Hang on! (telephone ringing) Louise? Listen to me. What? Screw you! Please hold. - Harry, you can't talk with her. She's got representation. - Oh, I can't talk to my own wife, can't I? - Well, you can't negotiate with her. I'm gonna negotiate with her counsel. - Is that how it works? I can't talk to my own freakin' wife? What kind of state do we live in? (telephone ringing) Please hold. Louise, that was Jonas and he says I can't talk to you. Screw Jonas! - It's me! What do you mean, screw Jonas? - Never mind, she ain't gettin' shit! - Harry, did you order the plastic? - Let me tell you a little story about the plastic. Once upon a time, screw you and the plastic, too! - Screw you, Harry! (bell dinging) (playful music) (doorbell ringing) (knocking) (sighing) (woman moaning) - [Steve] Nora? Nora? Nora, you alright? (gasping) - Who the hell are you? - She's my wife and that, I believe, is my four iron! - Oh, my God, Steve, what the hell are you? Oh, my God! Tom, it's okay. I'll be, just give me one second, okay? What are you doing here? - I'm supposed to pick up Ashley. - Oh, really, is she in the bushes? - I rang the doorbell, nobody answered. - Okay, well, your daughter was sitting here waiting for you and when you didn't show up she went to spend the night at her friend Rachel's house. - My car broke down. Who's he? - That's Tom, he's new in the firm. - Oh, employee orientation? (laughs) - You know what, Steve? I think we're supposed to be moving on here. So what do you expect? - Well, let's see, um, not this! - Why don't you come back a little later and we'll just, we'll sit down and we'll have a conversation. (frantic comical music) (yelling) (horn honking) - [Driver] Get off the road, you idiot! (toy horn squeaking) - Where'd you learn to drive? - [Veronica] The perfect ending to a perfect day. - (laughs) 600 million dollars from the likes of Mr. Gordon. - Larry, tomorrow morning I want you to start buying up our shares. Slowly, carefully. Small orders. You know, nothing to raise eyebrows. - As your lawyer I am obligated to tell you-- - And so you have, counselor. And so you have. - J.T., we have a good thing here. - I want it to be great. Is there something wrong with that? Hmm, wanting to be great? - Doesn't that strike you as, I don't know, being just a little bit-- - Just a little bit what? Oh, come on, say it, Larry. A little what? Greedy? Greed, it's just a word, Larry. An ordinary word for ordinary people. Come here. Look at them all down there. Every day it's the same thing. They get up. They make their coffee, they get dressed, they go to work. One hour lunch, go home, eat dinner, watch TV, maybe have a bowl of ice cream. (sighing) Ordinary people shuffling around. Taking only what's given them. We're not like them, Larry. We are not ordinary. No, sir. What we are, what we do, it takes strength, it takes courage. It takes fucking talent. Go buy those shares, Lar. (tense music) Well, here's to all the ordinary people, without whom there would be no standard of measurement. - Mr. Steve? - Hector, what are you doing in that thing? - It's a company car. - You got the job? - Yeah, I took your advice. I tried to play it safe. I didn't say nothing. But the interview ended and I was walking out. Suddenly, something came over me, and then I went for it! I told them about the download pre-emptor and they went crazy! They brought all these people and all these lawyers and they put down some papers and they offered me six million dollars! - Six million? (speaking foreign language) - Please put that in the trunk, Alvin. - Personal assistants? - No, they just have crazy sex with me. Well, thank you, Mr. Steve! Hey, you the hombre! I love this country! I can't wait to become a citizen! Adios! (comical music) (bicycle bell tinkling) (Harry sniffling) - He got his own Alvin. She said that I've changed. I'm uh, I'm all closed up. I don't think that I've changed that much, have I? - Wow, look at these. My God. Look at me back then. (laughs) Oh, my God! - Wow! Almost cute. - Yeah, almost. Oh, look at this. Whatever happened to Mickey Fish? - Who? - Class president. Straight A student. Captain of the baseball team. This guy could have been anything he wanted. Probably is. - Reminds me of Louise. Why don't you give the guy a call? Find out where he's at now. - He's probably CEO of some big company. - So? - So, walk in his office, hey, Mick, how you doin'? I'm good, Steve. How are you? Well Mick, been a long, hard climb to the middle. - You know, bro, I've been packing up every reference there is to Louise in this office the last couple hours and I am exhausted. I think I'm just gonna crash over here. - God, whatever happened to Mickey Fish? (soft bluesy music) Harry, we're in trouble. - I know. (banging) (sniffing) ("Thus Sprach Zarathustra" by Richard Strauss) (stick cracking) (cow mooing) (telephone ringing) - OmniGlow. - [Herb] Hi there, this is Herb Zissner up here at Zissner Dairy Farms. - Uh, dairy farms? You got the wrong number. - [Herb] No, no, no, listen, I think I've come up with an idea for your light sticks. - Okay, hold on. Harry, it's somebody for our light sticks. Alright, dairy boy, go ahead. - [Herb] No, you gotta get up here and see this. - See what? - [Herb] (laughs) I can't explain it over the phone. It'll sound too strange! You really need to get up here and see it for yourself. - A dairy farm? Where the hell are we? - I don't know, somewhere near Modesto, I think. - That's good, here I was depressed all the time thinking we were going to Fresno. (sighing) - Alright, come on, give it a rest. - Hey, where's the toothless guy with the banjo? (laughs) You got a real purty mouth, boy. - Dear God, I hope we get there fast. (Harry squealing) (upbeat music) - This farm's been in our family for over 100 years. - That's amazing. - Yeah, it's tough these days, though, I tell ya. We just found out feeding supplies are going up again. - The little brown one back there, is she single? - That's just, (laughs) um, so, I still don't see how we fit in to all this. - Well, the sun's going down. You'll find out soon enough. - And you guys know where you're taking us, right? - I know exactly where we're taking you. Just relax we'll be there in just a second. (dramatic music) - Wow! - Son of a bitch! - The dairy industry was worth well over 24 billion dollars last year. - That's a lot of milk. - Who knew? - Yeah, not one penny of that came from a cow who wasn't pregnant. - Why's that? - Biology 101, cow ain't pregnant she ain't producing milk. - I never thought of it like that. - [Harry] I never thought about it at all. - [Steve] What the hell is going on? (cows mooing) - What kind of crazy crap are you good old boys into up here? - Got your light stick, got your cow. - You see, it's critical for us to know precisely when a cow goes into heat. Now once she does, we've only got a very short period of time to inseminate her. - So you jam a light stick up her ass? - No, sir. - On her ass! You see, on a cow's rump there's this leathery area where she feels nothing. It's totally numb. You could go in there and pull out a handful of hair, she wouldn't feel a thing. - Where's the fun in that? (laughs) - Go ahead, you wanna try it? - No, I just washed my hands. - Suit yourself. See, right here on this spot is where we glue what we call in our industry the fertility indicator. - Yeah, but instead, that's where we put your light stick. - When a cow comes into heat it attracts another cow. Look over there. - Oh, so the bulls-- - We don't got no bulls. Heck, if we wait around for a bunch of bulls to bust nut, we go bust. - Yeah. - So the females do that to each other? - Why, you dirty dog. I got that one on DVD. Prison Heifers! (laughs) - Actually, there's nothing sexual about it. You see, when a cow goes into heat another cow will rise up and mount her, pressing its chest down onto her rump. It's called ridin'. - They made a sequel? (light stick cracking) - And God said, let there be light! - Let there be light! Hallelujah! - Yeehaw! - This is the fertility indicator everybody's using. - AFI, American Farms International. - Slightly better than nothing at all. - Real tough to spot during the day, impossible at night. - But, it's the only thing on the market. - I'm tellin' you, this is a helluva lot better than that. - And AFI sells a gazillion of those. - So what are you guys saying? - You guys can revolutionize the American dairy industry with your light stick. - You guys are going to be very, very rich. - You guys are serious? - Yeah. - But you're talking about competing with this AFI. This must be a huge company. - Oh, yeah, one of the biggest. - Well, they've got financing and manufacturing and distribution. - Yeah, but you got the product. - And who says you need to compete? Kevin called AFI this afternoon. - I told them we were meeting with you. So if something were to come about from all of this, maybe we-- - Oh, well, of course, if something were to come about. - We'll see, I mean big companies like that, they don't pay a whole lot of attention to little folks like us. - No. - Who knows if they'll even call back? (frantic music) (watch beeping) (telephone ringing) - Yeah? - J.T., I think we have a problem. (laughing) This is not gonna be good news. - They do what? In the ass? - You know I don't do that, honey! - Remember when we used to come here every Saturday for breakfast, just you and me? - Yeah, and I used to put maple syrup in your coffee. - Yes! I miss that. I miss you, Ash. - I miss you too, Dad. Is there anything else you miss? - I saw this great new use for our light sticks, on cows. - On cows? - Yeah, I swear! No, I mean it. Honey, this could be it. - Your big deal? - You never know. - Have you heard anything, anyone call? - No. - It's been two days! - I know. I tried to get someone interested other than AFI, but, light sticks on cows, people just laugh. - I knew it! I knew it, it's just like all the other ones. Just a lot of crap! You remember when we started this place? We built this business from nothing! All the hours, all the late nights. We even helped build the building, for Christ's sake! Do you remember that? For what, for what? This is what we get, huh? This is what I get? I'm tellin' ya, I can't take it anymore, man! I'm like a fish! You know, they've already gaffed me and put me in the boat. - Harry, you're talking crazy. - Am I? I don't think so, bro. There comes a time when a man has to realize he's not full of potential anymore. That he's a failure. - What kind of fish? - What? - You said you were a fish. What kind of fish? - I don't mean I'm really a fish. I was trying to make a point. - Yeah, but what kind, like a shark or a flounder? - That's really funny. You what man, I'm done, I'm finished. - Wait, what do you mean you're done? You're not done! - We have nothing, Steve! - What do you mean we have nothing? We have our company! - Are you kidding me, our company? This pathetic, measly, two-bit rinky-dink company? - You flounder! - And what are you, huh? What the hell are you? A frickin' puffer fish? That's what you are, pal, a puffer fish! Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk and nothing happens! - Yeah, well something did, 'cause you didn't build this pathetic, measly, two-bit operation, I did! - And you forgot rinky-dink. - Flounder! - Puffer! (door slamming) - I believe that I am entitled-- - [Harry] Entitled? - To be supported, yes-- - Entitled to what? - In the manner that-- - What is that supposed to mean, what did you do? - Harry, please! This is not the way we handle this thing! - Quiet! What did you do? - I nurtured. - You nurtured? - Louise, you don't have to say anything. - I did nurture! That's right! - What did you nurture? - You know exactly what I mean, Harry! - Oh, gimme a break, will you? - Harry! - You nurtured nothing. - There were sleepless nights! I have stood by-- - Okay, Nora's here. Everything's-- - I'm sorry. - We'll start. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Excuse me, what are you doing here? What do you have to do with this? - I'm a lawyer, Harry. - You're her lawyer? - [Jonas] Harry. - Wait a second, wait a second! She can't do that, she's one of the partners! You gotta ridicuse yourself! - Recuse, Harry, that's recuse. And no, I don't have to. - Harry, please. - I beg your pardon, would you please explain to this bottom feeder-- - Harry, shut up! - Nice. - Let's just make this short and sweet. - [Jonas] Yes. - My client has instructed me to make the following offer. My client will retain the house, the car and all personal possessions acquired during the course of this union. - Hang on a second. Why don't you just take my balls? Let me put 'em both right here for you. You take the right one, you take the left one. And use both hands, you wanna get it all. - [Jonas] Harry! - Are you kidding me, do I get to keep my own balls? - Harry, sit! - In exchange, my client agrees to relinquish any and all claims, now and in perpetuity, against your share of the company, OmniGlow Inc. - You've got a heart of gold. - Honey, I told you not to let this bother-- - How can he say that to me?

That's AFI on the big board. They want to meet with us tomorrow morning. - AFI, they do? - Yes, they do! - What else did they say? - Well, they're considering making us an offer. - They said that? - Well, no, not exactly, but I could tell. What, you don't think I know this stuff? - Jonas, what the hell is the matter with you? - What is the deal? - I have to pee! - Well, go! - Oh, this is big. This is big! Okay, so, I told them that we were willing to listen, entertain offers. You see, you can't get too excited about this because they sense that. See, so I played the game. I was cool, very cool. - You were cool! (laughs) - You should have seen me! - You son of a bitch, you're a freakin' doll! - Okay, what's next? - Well, it's hard to say. It sounds like they really want OmniGlow out of the bovine fertility industry fast. Fatal flaw number one, gentlemen, enthusiasm. - Bad, bad. - I am thinking they're gonna make us an offer, maybe one, one point two. - Million? - Oh, yes, babies, 1.2 million dollars! (cheering) - Sold, to the man with the light stick up the cow's ass! - No, no, no, we ask for three million. - Jonas, Jonas, don't screw this up! - Guys, please, you have got to trust me on this. I know how these things work! This is a slow motion, sensual dirty dance, you know. They offer one, we come back with three million. They come back with two million.

(laughing) Holy crap, I had no idea, Jonas, you knew how to do such complicated deals! - It's law! I could do deals like this in my sleep! (exhaling) Are you okay? - Yeah, just, you know, I'm just excited. - I think you got him on the cha, cha, cha. - I think so.

(breathing loudly) Oh, God, I love the smell of a deal in the morning. - Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We'd like to take this opportunity to welcome you to AFI. Thank you very much for coming. Just a reminder, what will be discussed here in this room remains in the strictest confidentiality. This, of course, excludes spouses. - Yeah, but who's got one of those anymore, right? (laughs) - Let's get right down to business. AFI is prepared to extend a very generous offer to you for the purchase of OmniGlow Inc. Now, we have analyzed and evaluated what we believe is an appropriate value for your technology and associated application. Allow me to just jump right past the formalities. Here it is, short and sweet. 20 million. - 20 million what? - We'll pay you 20 million dollars. I'm sure everyone will agree that this amount is more than generous compensation. Veronica will make sure (heart beating) all the necessary documents are drawn up and we'll have it delivered to your office this afternoon via courier. - Uh, excuse me just a minute. - Excuse me, just, I'll be right back. - He is, quite apparently, not feeling well and she's gonna probably go out there and try to help him out. 20 million dollars is a, uh, well, a very generous offer, I imagine. Where do we sign? Can we sign now, please? - Will you excuse us a moment? (Steve breathing heavily) - Steve? You okay? - I don't know. Yeah, I think so. - Are you? - Could you turn around for me? - What? - Please. I know, just turn around. That's fine, thanks. I just wanna make sure I'm not dreaming. - No, hon, you're not dreaming. - This is it. (tender music) It's finally here. This doesn't happen to me. It's what I've always wanted. - Well, what do you know? - What do you know? - Let's go back in, okay, come on. - [Steve] Yeah. - It's about time. You'll blow the deal! - He has got to know something. - You think? - Oh, yeah. Do you see what he did? He just got up and walked right outta the room. Oh, he's good. He is good. How about that other one, huh? They got the whole good cop/bad cop thing going. (sighing) I'm going up to 30. - J.T., I have to remind you that this whole thing is a big risk already. Gordon said nothing changes. - That's right and what they have changes everything. If Gordon catches wind of their product this entire deal goes down the drain. And may I remind you, counselor, it's a 600 million dollar deal. Come on, Lar, don't you wanna be great? (laughs) (tense music) I've reconsidered. - Oh, look, Mr. Montgomery, I have to tell you-- - In light of new revelations I have been forced to reassess the value of your company and... Excuse me, what are you writing? - Uh, uh, well, I've evaluated what I consider to be a fair value for our technology and associated application. (clearing throat) - Oh, I'd like to see that. - Well, yeah, I don't think so. - Well, I'm not certain we can move forward if can't see that. - Well, this is proprietary information. So, no way. - [Harry] (coughing) Give it to him right now! - Give it to him! - [Harry] (coughing) Show him the pad! - Another moment. (laughs) (tense music) (all whispering) - [Harry] We'll kill you! - I'm making a drawing. - Alright, this is it. Now, mind you, I am not going to offer one penny higher. 40 million.

Peanuts, sir? 40 million! - Oh, my God, stop it! - Interesting day, huh? - Yes, yes, it was. - It's funny, you work and you work and you work and you work and you work and you work and you come close. And then one day (popping). So are you seeing this Tom guy, or what? - Steve, let's not go there, okay? - I mean, come on, Nora, 3:30 in the afternoon? - What, you've never made love in the afternoon? - Yeah, I mean, maybe. We never did. We never made love in the afternoon. - Well, we could have. Why didn't we? I mean, I don't know, did we just take all of our imagination to the office and leave it there or what? - I was trying to get somewhere. I wanted to make something of myself, you know that. - No. No, it was just never enough for you. Was it? - You talking about us? - Is there an us?

Must be great coming up here on the weekends and leaving the stress of the city behind. - This is where I live. I built this place from the ground up. - Wow. Mick, I, what do you do? For work? - A little of this and a little of that, you know. I've been doing some carpentry lately. - Carpentry? - Yeah, I really like it. Every once in a while I write a little piece for the local paper. You okay? Something wrong? - Nothing, I just, you know. So, but tell me, so after Princeton, what? - It's funny how easily you can get trapped. Expectations. Other people's expectations of who you are and what you need to be in order to be happy.

(laughs) - You say that like it's a bad thing. - I just, you know. - Oh, come on, who wants to talk about the past? It's already been done.

I gotta deal with that thing and I gotta long trip ahead of me, so I'd better. - Steve, I'm really glad you came up. - Yeah, yeah, it was great. - Whoo! - Whoo! - It's something, isn't it? - Yeah, it is. Very peaceful. - I find it all slows down if I let it. Haven't figured out why yet, but I'm working on it. Whoo, feel that wind! You have to just let it carry you. - Yeah, right.

I just thought I'd drop by and see how things are doing. Oh, my, I forgot it's the big day today, huh! - Robert, how are you? Good to see you! - What a coincidence, huh? - Hey, how are you? - Good, good. - Let's go. - Oh, God. Stop it! - Robert Lawson, I'm the money manager. - J.T. Montgomery, I'm the money. - That went well. (tense music) - Mr. Montgomery, good morning. - Good morning. - Gentlemen, before we tend to the business at hand we have humbly assembled this culinary feast in your honor. Please, help yourselves. (slurping) - Uh, pass. - Well, shall we? - Can you really get 40 million dollars in one of those briefcases? - Actually, Harry, that's usually done either by a money order or a wire transfer. - So, what's it gonna be, a money order or a wire transfer? - Um, that would be C, none of the above. - I'm sorry? - You know, the boys on Wall Street have a saying. It's all a big game, like Monopoly, only you get to keep the money. Now, you're probably wondering what does that mean, right? - Right. - Well, it means gentlemen, lady, that you landed on Boardwalk with four hotels. The deal is off the table. - Wait, off the table? You can't do that! - Excuse me! We had a deal here, pal! You do know what a deal is, don't you, Wall Street? - Clearly, you don't understand what you're talking about. What you had, technically, was a Letter of Intent. - Jonas, straighten this character out. - That letter permits us to withdraw. We can look at your books, look at your patent, look at you. We can turn you inside out, but we are not obligated to close escrow. That's just the way it works. Tell 'em, Jonas. - [Steve] Jonas, what's he talking about? - He's right. - Jonas, you gotta be kidding me? - He's right! - You got excited, didn't you? Busy little bees counting your money. And all of those new cars out in the parking lot, very nice. Which one of you purchased the Porsche? Wonderful choice. - No, there is no substitute. - And I'm sure Steve over here isn't the only one who got a little crazy. Show of hands? - You are such as asshole. - I'll take that as a yes. We all know about the boat, Captain. - You bought a boat? - A small boat! - Oh, my God. - Well, as I was saying, I recently had the opportunity to review that analysis of yours. I looked over all of the numbers and well, frankly, they just don't quite add up. (tense music) You almost had me. (laughs) Enjoy it. It's the most expensive laugh you'll ever have. - It doesn't mean, it's just Wild Bill, he doesn't mean anything by it. - You all thought you had me, didn't you? But you can't fool me now that I know who you people really are. Nevertheless, we all know this is business. So, I'm going to present to you an offer with a slightly revised number, 2.5 million. - 2.5 million, to de divided amongst? That's bullshit. - Let me tell you something, Gilligan. You got lucky, all of you. Your little company is nothing more than a fart in a wheat field. You should be thankful that I'm going to cover your debts, not to mention some of your 'deficit spending'. - Alright, we'll give you our answer in a couple of days. - Oh, no, no, no, no. You will let me know now. You have five minutes. - What the hell was that, Jonas? You're supposed to know what you're doing! - Jonas, what the hell is this? (all shouting heatedly) - More champagne, J.T.? - Don't mind if I do, Lar. Don't mind if I do. - Masterful performance, all of it. (laughs) - Well, you didn't think I was going to let a bunch of wanna-bes beat me out of 40 million, did you? - There was never really any doubt. And I must say your sense of timing was impeccable. - I thought I'd leave them in there for a while to ripen on the vine, so to speak. And if my hunch is correct they should be hitting the ground right about-- - [Nora] Who told you to go out and buy a stupid boat? - You think this is fun, wait'll we close the deal with Gordon tomorrow. (glasses clinking) - Well, J.T., we've talked it over and we're wondering if you can do something about hiding the money. - We can do that. - Of course, we do that all the time. The Bahamas, the Caymans, you name it. - I was thinking about somewhere a little closer to home. We'd like you to take the 2.5 million in cash, preferably small bills, wrap it up into little bundles-- - And stick it up your corporate ass. (playful music) - I see. Alrighty then. - Yeah. - Oh, there is one little thing I neglected to mention. It's the craziest thing, really. As it turns out, I don't need all of you to agree on this deal, just one. Imagine my surprise when my counsel informed me that your patent is registered under the names of the individual partners, not the company. Anyone know what that means? Anyone on the crack legal staff wanna take a shot at this one? Jonas, Nora? - It means that any of us independently can transfer the right to make the light sticks without the permission of others. - You are beginning to give me the heebie-jeebies. But he is absolutely right. Now, whose brain child was it to set it up this way? - We trust each other. - Oh, really? Well, we'll find out soon enough. Because I'm going to offer the entire 2.5 million to one of you for your rights under the patent. No split, kind of a winner take all situation. I'll be at the Hotel Piermont tonight enjoying a scotch and soda until eight o'clock. I'm going to bring a cashier's check, confident that one of you, I don't know which one, I don't care which one, but one of you will show up to seal the deal. The rest of you can go to hell. - Stop! Stop! Stop! Hello? Stop the digging! Sir, there's a change! Just fill in the hole! (frantic music) (screaming) - Hi, Louise! - Harry! - Louise, I, I apologize. I'm a scoundrel, I'm a turd. I'm humbled in your presence, Louise. I'm so sorry. Look, honey, something's happened. Things have been so good lately. Baby, we, we have some decisions to make. Louise, I love you.

Look, we, we were negotiating. We negotiated a deal with them so that we could bring everything to you under the same banner. Which is what we've done, which is what I've done. - You've landed on Boardwalk, J.T., with four hotels. The deal's off the table. - Off the table? Off the table? No. No, no, no, you can't do that. You can't do that, that's impossible. That's, we had a deal. Tell him we had a deal! Tell him we have a contract! We have a contract, Luis! - Well, that was a Letter of Intent, actually. - Can you imagine a 600 million dollar deal falling apart because of a 45 cent light stick on a cow's ass? - Come on, Luis, please don't play this, don't do this. - Come on, J.T. This is business. This kind of thing happens every day. You know that. You're a professional, you're a veteran. I mean, what's the big deal? It's not like you went out and bought up all your own stock based on information that you had. You wouldn't do that. And it's a good thing, too, because with all these light sticks around the boys on Wall Street about to find out that the deal is off. Your stock is gonna be worth, well, shit. - No, no, no, hold on a second, wait a second. You're forgetting one thing, one little minor detail. I have the license to make the product, Gordon. - That's very true. But as you know, any partner can give a license and if these guys can give one to you, they can give it to anybody; Purina, General Electric, Mr. Magoo. Sharing is not a concept that appeals to me. And in light of all these revelations today I've really just kind of soured on the idea of the dairy industry. Oh, (laughs) that was a pun. - Mr. Gordon, you and I were gonna work something-- - I like your product, I really do and I think it was a good pitch. I really do. But, I have to tell you something. We've decided to go another direction. We've decided to go into coffee. I just, I love those caramel macchiatos. We have some out in the reception area. You oughta try one on your way out, gentlemen. (clock chiming) - You could have closed our deal and walked away a winner. But you didn't. You couldn't. It just wasn't enough for you. - Who do you think you are telling me what's enough, you little prick? You think just because you took me down you're a big hotshot now? Just who the hell do you think you are? - I'm just an ordinary guy.

What's the deal, what are we getting? - Yeah, yeah, what's the deal? - There is no deal. - What? - What? - What are you talking about? Bill told us the whole thing; the photos, the check, J.T.'s deal with Gordon. - Well, apparently Bill didn't tell you the whole story. Gordon doesn't want to be in the dairy business anymore. - Well, where the hell is he? I'll get him back in the dairy business in one second! - No, Harry, it's over, there's no deal. - Okay, but at least we still have the 2.5 million, right? - We do have the 2.5 million? - I, I couldn't take it, Harry. I didn't want his money. I, I hope, I hope that's okay... - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What are we gonna do? - I'll tell you what we're gonna do. We're gonna stick with it. We have a good product and we have each other and we're gonna make it work. - Yeah, like we can afford to walk away from 40 million dollars! - Harry? - No. - Harry. Come on, Harry. Come on. (laughs) Harry? Harry, (laughs) come on!
