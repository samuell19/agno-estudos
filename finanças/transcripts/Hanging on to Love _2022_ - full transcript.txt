Oh, maybe you a four, now that I got a good angle. She's super thick, thick, thick, thick big. What type of material is this? The kind that stretches way to thin. I know that is not my name brand designer dress that just fell to the floor. And if it is, I better be getting a 59% discount. I'm sorry, Misty. Look, it's on the house. E-Rock. Don't try to be nice now. I heard you back there talking all that mess. Man, can you can just turn around head towards the exit? Angelo. Nobody was even talking to you. You need to learn some customer service etiquette like your cousin. Hey, why don't you go do some inner thigh exercise, you holding up my line. Look, thank you for your business as always. Thank you.

Oh yeah, y'all straight out a comic book. Ooh, here you go, mm mm mmm. Thank you, have a good day. All right, so when you gonna let me take you out, Jewel? Please. Never, Angelo. Man, maybe if you stopped coming here with the same old tired ass dress, you will find you a real one. Man, that's her lucky dress. Her mom's made it for her. Oh, okay, E-rock, I see you. Look at you trying to pay attention. Oh, I pays attention. You know what? I can't with you two. This too much. What? Two cousins for the price of one! A knucklehead and a real O.G. like me. A whole two cousins, huh? Yeah, I'm full price, he's free 99. Whatever, bye guys. No I'm full price. Buy one, get one free over here. Man, back up. Listen, you know, business doesn't always work out when you let family work for you. Man, it's family, there's no choice, this is what we do. There's always a choice, okay? Man, whatever Jewel, have fun on your eighth date this month and I hope you bring some hard to clean stains on that dress when you bring it back. See you later Jewel, have a good time. So I've always been unlucky in love. My dad refers to it as being... Just like your mama. My mom, whose name is also Jewel. Couldn't find it in herself to settle down. She was very driven and independent and very matter of fact. But she was also very loving and she loved to be in love. Yo, why you always gotta bring my husband into it. I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry. I'm just, I'm just saying. Here, come here for a second. Come here, come here, come here. Let me talk to you, let me talk to you. Sit on my lap, come here. Let me talk to you for a second, look. It's a little bit more than what you think, you know what I'm saying? I'm really digging you, you know. Really. My mom said this black dress was a lucky dress just for me. Although, I can never comprehend how she thought so. None of her lucky dresses resulted in relationships that lasted. In fact, they were quick. Some were really quick. She felt like if she fell out of love with someone, she had the right to leave and find someone else to fall in love with. Especially for you. Why? All this for me? All this for you. Aw, that's a beautiful necklace I see you're wearing. Yes, I am, I love it, - I wear it everywhere. - Yeah. Excuse me. Yes sir, can I help you? Uh, not talking to you. - Well, you... - Jewel, baby... You weren't feeling good and I guess it's your daddy, but nah, that wouldn't be your daddy because he wouldn't be sitting on the same side. He might just be - your sugar daddy, - Well... I don't know one way or the other, you told me you was sick. I'm feeling better now. This what we doing? Well, obviously, - she didn't wanna be with you. - This what we doing? Is this what we, yo, calm down, calm down, calm down, old man, - listen, listen, listen. - Ain't no calm, watch your finger, man. Listen, I been watching y'all the whole damn time. I seen you in the parking lot. - I'm glad you can see. - Now, you need to leave. - Oh yeah I can see real good. - I'm glad you can see. You need to see your way out. Yeah, I'm gone do that. I'm gone do that, I'm like, - you know what? - Yeah, yeah, do that. I'm going to do that just for you, but YOU don't call me. - 'Cause I'm gone be sick. - You don't even have to worry about that. You're disrespecting the lady, man. That's not a lady. Oh yes, she is, she's more than a lady. That's why she's not with you. My dad disagreed. He feels like you should fight for love. And he sure did fight for her love. Up until she flew free. I may have picked up on some of my mom's traits. Hey T how are you? Yo, what's up, Jewel, how you? I'm doing good, I'm doing good. Listen, I'm on my way right now. I should be there within about you know, five or 10 minutes. But I'm so excited for our date tonight, I'm so excited. Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. I'm actually still in the studio. I'm working with a couple of my artists. We got a big project coming up. I gotta tackle this most definitely. What you - artists? What do you mean you still in the city, we planned this out already. We already been planning this out this week to see me. So I mean, did you forget or something? I don't get it. I got you. I got you. But we got a huge project coming up and, like I was saying before, I think we talked about it, I'm trying to get my net worth from 2 million to 4 million. I got so much stuff I'm working on, I gotta tackle this most definitely. Are you, are you kidding me? We've been, uh, wait a minute. I know you did not just schedule some whack studio session like for this, I look, look at this! I got my lucky date night dress on. You're not up all night to get lucky. I got you. Like I said, I got an engineering business as well. I most definitely got to tackle all these businesses to be able to get my net worth up. This, it's most definitely what I'm about, I got to. You know what? You know what? Listen here, let me tell you something. Since you like to play C notes, how about you see this? You ain't getting no nookie, no nookie from me. - Bye. - Hold on, hold on. If I sense things are not going well, I do end things pretty quickly. I cannot stand this music, like, uh uh. This sounds so played out, gimme that. Why not this? - Oooh yeah, feels nice! - No, no, no. We not listening to this for sure. What? I'm not arguing. Uh uh, wait. No, quit, we not listening to this. You know, how you going to take a woman out like me, and not even give her a choice of music. Let's see, you don't have no say-so in this car. Rick wanna listen to what I want to listen to. You know what, pull over, let me out. Pull over? Let me out. Are you serious right now? Yeah I'm serious. Have fun with yo wack ass playlist. Life is too short. You got to keep it moving. Yo, do you see your boy? She, she, she didn't answer the first message or the second, but the third one, look, got her, look. Do you see the outfit? Oh my God! What - the boots! Yo, hey, I don't know if I am, but I'm gone try for sho to get some - you crazy if you think I ain't, look AT her. Come on, look, look at me though, do you? She didn't answer the first or second message, but the third one, ha, silly, look at me. Now see I told you, I told y'all I was going to get it fam, y'all thought I wasn't. Know what I'm saying and now look at me, you feel me? It's over with, boy, like your boy didn't... Yo, like, Jewel! Yo! Thanks for lunch. Well, I've gotta treat a special lady to a special meal. We keeping it simple, right? Yeah, simple. Oh, thanks for dessert. You went way out. Okay, let me tell you if the date goes left, I won't feel so bad for leaving you cause you didn't invest a lot. Oh! Well, how courteous of you. I try. Cannot believe I'm hanging out with the one and only Jewel. It is pretty surreal, right? Yeah, why did it take so long? I felt a connection the first time I saw you. That's yo bad, 'cause you should've asked me out that first time. True. True. But, you didn't feel the connection the first time we saw each other? I don't believe I did. You cold with it! Oh, that's cold. Yep, mm hmm, that's what they say. They? How many is they? Oh, hold up, wait. We 'bout to go there for real? Yeah, you trying to hit below the belt, I gotta get my one, two jab in. All you have is a jab. Okay. I'm gonna keep it appropriate, so yeah. All I got is a jab. So tell me, what's your story with love, Earl? There isn't one. I find that hard to believe. Believe it. So, no kids, you ain't never been married? Never been in love either? Check, check, check. Why? I was focused on my hustle And has that changed? I don't know yet. But what's your story? Let me grill you. The opposite of yours. Trying too hard to fall in love. And how's that been going? Being that I'm at your establishment every week, to pick up my date night dress, I would say that's a dead ass fail. Ha ha ha! Dead ass! A thousand percent, you dig? Wow. I still can't believe you remember what I said about my mom giving me that dress. I remember things about people I like. Hmmm. Your mother pass? Yeah. Few years ago. Hmm. Sorry to hear that. It's all good. Hey, I remember the first time you came in, it was your 25th birthday. Wow! You seriously do remember everything! Yeah, I do. You came next day, like it was a rough night. I was like, wow. Pretty much, I mean, it was really fun that night. You got to live life to the fullest, but knowing me, it's the same old trending story. Trending? Why it gotta be trending? It don't have to be. I end every relationship quickly or I never start one, you know? Cause I, I just don't want to settle. Well, how do you define settle? Unrealistic, I guess. Alright, well let's take a bike ride. Oh, you do not take me as the type that rides bikes on the beach. That's cause you got tunnel vision. Open up your mind, girl. I do not, psshhh, I do not - have tunnel vision, okay? - Let's go have some fun! Hey, it's my treat for your birthday. Hmm. Okay. Little birthday bike ride for the celebration. We doin' it big, huh? Yeah, we doin' it big, better watch out. So when's your birthday? So I can take you out and do something special? The day before yours. You're lying! For real. You mean to tell me that we're neck and neck in birthdays? Wow, that's crazy. That's crazy, but it's kind of, stalker-ish. If you don't knock it off! I'm far from stalker status. Right, you just remember things about people you like, huh? Yeah, you're catching on. I'm a good student. Two shells in the sand. Two shells in the sand. If it's meant to be, it will be. Just like that? Just like that. Just be real, keep it a 100. You're so sure of yourself. Well, you gotta be. You gotta be sure of yourself or nobody else will be. Well since we keepin' it a hunnit, these rough hands are a bit much. Oh, you got jokes! You got jokes. I mean like, they do have something that's called lotion, you know that, right? Look, I be in there working seven days a week, creasing, crisping, and starching up clothes. These is, these is hands of a man! Well be gentle, man, 'cause I don't want to be looking like Battlecat at the end of our date, them ashy old things. Well, get me some lotion then! Nope! You should have lotioned up with some Crisco before you came out the house, looking like that. Ohh ho ho! Not the Crisco! Not the Crisco! Look, I want to show you something. What's this? Dresses that I design. For real? Yep. Wait, hold up. So you mean to tell me that you had the talent all this time to make any dress you wanted to make for yourself, but you chose to wear the same dress date after date? Uh, except for on today's date! The exception, not the rule. You know, it was, it was a way for me to stay connected with my mom. You know, my lucky dress. You're talented, like really talented. You like them? I do. Awww. I always did want to get my fashion in high-end boutiques. Do it. I want to, but it's not that easy, you know? It, it takes - - Perseverance, Persistence. You already got the talent. Yeah, and it also takes a lot of money, you know, because not having money and connections, these are just pipe dreams without it. What, you need to borrow a few dollars? More like a lot of dollars. Well, look, I'm kinda short right now, but I could fire Angelo and give you a job. Look, it also takes confidence and believing in yourself. Nobody can make your dreams come true but you. What dreams do you have? What I'm doing right now. Run my family business. Is that someone else's dream? No. It's actually, mine. Look, I always kept the clothes that I did have, which wasn't many, starched, crisp and creased up. Let me guess, Chucks too? Yeah, Chuck's too with different shoelaces, cause I only had one pair. But yeah, my mom's, pops, cousins, everybody would always have me iron up they clothes 'cause I was so cold with it. Ohhh, cold with the creases, huh? Yeah. I told them like, I'm gonna start charging y'all. My mom was like, hell yeah, charge they asses. But I had a few hustles. I just stacked up my money. Gave it to my moms, told her to put it away for the cleaners. I knew it was a family business, but I didn't know you started it. Technically I did, but my family, they ran it for years. Many years. I just got involved with it like last year. What? You were too busy running the streets with these other hoodlums? Something like that. I really like you, E-rock. Oh, so I made the cut for the second date? I think so. I just like the fact that I can be myself around you. I know you did not just fart. Hey, you said be yourself. Jewel, I know you did not just fart. I shouldn't have had that vegan ice cream. Aww you stink! Aww, that's nasty! - Wait! Come back! - Ohhh nooo! What about our birthday bike ride? That's canceled! Hey! Y'all should not be out here... no! A girl should not be smelling like that! Get off me! Come back, come back! I treat you to a meal and this is how you repay me. Well, that's what you get for treating me to some cheap ass meal. It followed you! That was a second one right there. Oh that's nasty, I don't do no stinkin' ass female! Wait, come back! Whoo! Hey, what's up, baby? Hey Miss Yvette, how you doing? I'm good, look here, I got little special thing I need you to do for me today. First of all, you see this big tag? Yeah. Yeah, I want you to leave that on there, because what had happened was, I bought it and I wore it and I was going to take it back. Messed around and got a stain on it, yeah. So what I want you to do is make sure you get that stain out right there and leave that tag on there. Now this one right here, whole different story, I done wore this 'bout four, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 times. So I just want that heavy starch back in it so it can bloom out. Mmhmm. You know what I'm saying, so I can show my shape off. Okay. You know what I'm saying? Okay. Take care of me like you always do, baby. But leave that price tag on. All right, heavy on the starch. Yeah, but leave that what? That tag on. All right, baby, good lookin' out. I got you Miss Yvette. Aww, Top, you know who this is? Man, what is y'all doing so close to me?

Aged so fast? I look good. On my mama, on my hood. Man, you ain't looked good till Myrtle passed away then you started trying to get your youth back. Oh, you damn right.

We trust you, but you try to get over on us, now, we gone have to cut you cause I need all my money. All of it, I told you we on a fixed income. Yeah, young punk. You'll get there. Y'all been coming around here for years. I told you, we appreciate your business. Look at him, trying to act all proper in front of his little girl, I see you youngster! I'll see you, man. Bland, come on, let's get out of here, man. Look at 'em, boy. You gonna tell me what have you smiling and grinning from ear to ear for the last two weeks, every time I see you. Have I been? Like a baby baboon happy to see his mammy. All right, all right, I met somebody. Here we go. Dad, you know, you came over here to cook me a pre-birthday breakfast and not be no Dave, the downer. First of all, I'm James, the jokester and we both know damn well, when you say you met somebody, how it's gone end up. Not true. Well, here's the thing. You meet a lot of somebodies. They become old bodies, and then you meet a lot of more somebodies. Am I right? Dad. I, you know, I like this guy. E-rock he's different. E-rock? You dating somebody named E-rock? Dad. He's really nice. I like him. A deaf man can hear that break up a mile away. Not true, Dad. You just like your mama. Can you please stop saying that? I am not just like her. It's true. Why don't you stop comparing me to her? I'm not mama. Jewel, I know that. I've been wondering when you was going to realize that. Everything you've done, you've done to please her. Yeah, I have realized it. When? Now. Recently. Well. better late than never, I guess. Like I said, E-rock, he's different. I like him. Well, good. You should try something different. But here's the thing. Are you going to finally give this man a chance? I plan to and Dad, will you please stop smacking? I enjoy my food and it's good. I see, everyone knows that. Now see, if I say you just like your mama, I'll be in the wrong, huh? Oh, God. Well if it makes you happy, then keep smacking away. Thank you. You know, Jewell, your mom, she gave up on us way too soon. She didn't know how to fight for love. Yeah, but she also knew what it meant not to settle. Did this heifer just say... what? I'm sorry, Dad, I'm sorry. I didn't mean you. Okay? I know you were great to her. I always thought your mom was too good for me. Really? I did. She would bring the car by the shop every two weeks to get a oil change. Which one? That Corvette? You right, the Corvette. I actually fell in love with the Corvette first. And then your mama. Really? Mmmhmm. I would always put the recommended oil change date a few weeks out just so I can see her again. I'm surprised that worked on her. Me too. I finally built up enough courage to ask her out on a date. Mmhmm. Yeah. She was like, all uppity. "You expect me, to go out on a date with you? Look at you." Really? Really. I said, "Woman, look. This is a hard working man you looking at. Look at these hands." She felt my hands and was like, "Eww! They're so rough and gray, eww! Your mama was something else. Because these are the hands that built this business. I own it. And then she fell for the entrepreneur in you, huh? Hell yeah, she did. And then I adjusted my work belt so she can get a good angle of all of me. Uhhh, Dad! I'm not trying to hear that. And after I gave her this sausage, it was all she wrote. DAD! Please! Goodness. My ashy ass hands to God. I mean, she had to have had a reason to stick around for so long. Yeah, aside from you and your brothers, she couldn't get enough of big daddy's big kielbasa. Uh, Dad, please. But all I cared about was taking care of my family, building a family business and putting a smile on her face. But nothing was never good enough. I'm sorry, Dad. Don't be sorry, baby. Just do something to make me proud. It don't take a lot. Coming. Angelo? What are you doing here? Man I got forced to deliver this to you? Take this. Oh my goodness! This is my dress. This is, I can't believe he did this! Me either. This is my design! I can't believe he did this for me! Me. Either. Look, hey, take this too, huh, this is for you too. Vegan, huh? Oh my God. Wow, your cousin, he's too much. Like, this is his birthday tonight so I don't understand why he's giving me gifts. Yeah, me either, cause he's stupid, that's why. I mean, he's never done this before. If he did, I wouldn't let you know. Whatever. Listen, what's going on with you and Misty? Minding our own business. Well, you know tonight is your cousin's birthday, so why don't you guys come through? I didn't say I was gonna come, I'm outta here. What? What? She didn't. Oh, she didn't. Um, I'm here to pick up my man. He goes by the name of E-rock. That's me. Okay, you ready to turn up? Let's do this. Oh yeah. Thank you. Oh yeah, oh yeah. Yo, this is crazy. Oh, oh yeah. We home. Hmm, ain't lacking on invoices, I'll tell you that. Got a lot of business. Be cool, it's cool. Man, who is they? So you did your bid, got out and went back to your normal life, huh? Man, who are they? Tell him who I am, E-rock. He did a bid with me. And handled business for him on many occasions. Wasn't you supposed to run me a few racks a year ago? Look, I heard you was out for a minute, then went back in for a minute, though. Look, man, I keep my word. Did you do your due diligence? Just like you known in parts of these streets, I'm known in others, cuz. Man, this his business? I think we should do a little negotiation up in here. This you? I thought you was just a steam boy. What? Negotiations? We ain't negotiating with y'all, you crazy. Man, get out of here, who you, his translator? Look, we can work something out. Get you your racks, but my business, that's not in the equation. Why not? It generate income don't it? Man, this is a family business. A legacy I'm building. You building a legacy with a cleaners? Ha, yeah right. What you building a legacy with? Man, dude let me slide this punk. I'm just saying, man, I'm done with the streets. This is how I'm building now. Dry cleaning draws and socks? Yeah, whatever. You need to hold up with these comments, homeboy. Damn, dude, lemme take off on this fool. Don't trip, Ray. I'm a known black belt in the streets, you better ask about me, homeboy. I don't care nothin' 'bout that, homie. We ain't about to be karate chopping, but he do need to run me my racks though. How much money we talking 'bout? 20 racks. Twenty racks for what? For keeping air in his body. We don't got that kind of money just laying around. I'm gonna need some time. Hence my proposal for me to take this business off your hands. I can't do that. Do it look like I'm on some type of sympathy giving mission right now? Nope. Nope. Do I want my 20 racks right here, right now? Yep. Yep. Do I play when it comes to people running me my racks? Nope. Am I a slightly reasonable G though? Yep. Yep. Look, you got 20 days to make the required transaction or to sign this business over, partner. Hmm. It's 6:30. Look like we open for business. Chop, chop. Oh thank goodness y'all open early. I got day shift at work today. We didn't open early. No, we opened right on time. Oh, so I'm late for work or something? What? I don't know, are you? What time y'all open? 6:30. Oh, damn, I guess I am late for work. Well, let's get you out of here then. What can I help you with? Okay, so I need these super, super starched up and super creased up. My daddy still like his fits super creased up, you know? Does your daddy wear a feather in his hat with some super shiny ass fake ass gators? He does, you know him or something? Not exactly. Uh, what's your name sweetheart. Thunderbird. But my daddy called me Thunderchicken. It's a hood thing. Is that what you want me to put on here? Um, you can write my government. Okay, what's that?

Like, every entire week, for my birthday, he will make some really good home cooked meals. Oh, that's nice. Mmhmmm. Since I was a little girl. That's cause her mama didn't cook. She was too busy running the damn streets. Dad! I'm just saying, I didn't mind cooking for my kids, but uh, it would've been nice if they mama got burned with a little bacon grease. Mr. Lau, you got a little gravy juice dripping from your chain. Thank you. And call me James. Well, James, you still have a little bit right there. Right here. Move over a little bit. Right here? To the left. Like this? Yeah, just like that. Mr. Lau, she is my date! You a hater. How, what...? Misty. Do you have a mom or a sister that look like you? Mr. Lau. Finally, I wanted you to meet E-rock! E-rock, this is my brother, Abdul. Abdul, this is my guy, E-rock, and that's Angelo and Misty. You better had showed up to your sister's dinner. Sit down, boy, your food done got cold. Hey. You guys, like, I'm so happy. This is the best birthday ever. I haven't had this like, in a long time. Just chill, nice with good vibes and with loved ones. You okay, baby, is everything good? Yeah. You need some more water? Yeah, more please. Okay. Water? Water is for sissies. Let me break out the good stuff, hold on, hold on. Please do, damn. You messing with my sister, cuz? That's how you trying to come for me? I didn't even know - that was your sister! - We need more water in the fridge! How? I look just like her, man. Let me see, smile. I don't see it, man you ugly than a mother... Found it! So this was your plan, huh? What? You too? What? How you doing? Hi. You trying to infiltrate my crew and off me or something, man? What? Look you ain't fooling nobody, cuz, I know what's going down. Look what I got, you guys. Y'all want shots? Yes. Yes, please, please, please. All right, turn up crew! Turn up, turn up, turn up ayyy! Look, you got 20 days to run me my racks or my sister gonna see her fake ass boyfriend black and blue, cuz. You ain't bout to be punking me in front of my girl. Yo girl, this is my sister, homie. Abdul, what are you doing? It's him, too. E-rock, what are you guys doing? Look, you better tell her or I'm gone tell her... He owed me money. Look, he trying to say I owe him money. No, he actually owed me money. Not no 20 racks. What, your life ain't worth 20 racks partner? Wait a minute, wait. What? Y'all know each other? Not us! I didn't know him till he came in this morning trying to hold up the place! You trying to go back to prison? You just got out! Pops, I didn't hold up the place. I may have been there prior to them opening up though. So you broke into the place. Let's just say I was an early customer. Early customer, my ass. Check this out, we did a bid together. I saved him a ass whooping on many occasions. And you know what's the price that come with that pops! Oh, you should've said that in the first place. You got to pay. Not 20 racks! Ooohweee that's a little steep. No, it's not. And time is ticking. So what did you do time for, E-rock? God, I can't believe you. So is that why your family had to run your business for all those years? Because you were in prison doing a bid with this idiot. Idiot? You gone call your brother a idiot like that? I can't believe you. I mean, is your business even legit? Yes, my business is legit. I've worked my ass off for that cleaners. With what? Perseverance and being persistent? Yeah, the white pottery kind. He's lying, he's lying. So what was your plan? To get with Abdul's sister, make her all happy and feel giggly inside? Just so you can settle your little debt? No, that's not what it is. I didn't even know you guys were related. Everyone knows that I'm Abdul's sister on these streets. So I find that really hard to believe. I swear, I didn't know. Even if I did, I wouldn't put you in the middle of something like this. Oh, this is grown folk business. I'm gone mind my old folks business And E-rock, it was a pleasure meeting you. But by the look of the way her nose is flared up like that, I know that look. This is the ending of what just begun. Please, leave. LEAVE. Look, leave before I have to escort your ass out myself, cuz. You too, Abdul. Wait, what? I'm family! Yeah, family who's never around when you need them but only around when it's about them. What? You sound like, mom, she always hollering that bull crap. Now you hold on. I'm not going to let you talk to your sister like that in front of me. Man, look, how are you going to come at me like that and they the ones ruining everything? Aww, y'all done ruined my baby's birthday, God dammit! You know, Jewel, I really appreciate you for giving me another shot. Like you want a DJ right now? Like I can turn the tunes on for you if you want to. No, baby, it's okay. Yeah, you know, you're really special, Jewel. Aww, you think so? I do. I really do. You're so sweet. You know, I like to be upfront with women I'm serious about. I love, love to please. Mmm, that's a good thing. It is. Mmmm... I told you I love to please, right? You want to turn me on? Put these on. What the freak is this? What the freak is this? Big, cotton drawers turn me on. This isn't even my size, nowhere near my size, look like some dinosaur panties. Big drawers look sexy on women. Since when? Trust me. You're serious? Dead ass. Put 'em on. Wait a minute. Has somebody's cush been up in here, 'cause I don't wanna be wearing nobody else's cush juice. what kind of guy do you think I am? I'm trying to figure it out. The freak is this? They're new. Let me, let me see. See they're clean. They been in my glove compartment for a while. You know the, backwoods smoke and the... smell 'em. Smell them. Very clean. See? Now put 'em on. Matter of fact, I got it, I got it baby. Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, I got it. Gimme your foot. You got somebody new you want to introduce me to? No, I didn't like this last guy I was with. So we back to our old ways, huh? Dad don't start. Jewel, I'm not starting. Your mama's problem was, she was afraid of a good man. She was scared that she would lose her independence. She fought me a lot on that. Yeah, but a woman should be independent and she shouldn't have to settle. And I'm not saying she would've settled had she stayed with you. Well, have you ever thought maybe I'd be settling if I stayed with her? How could that be? Right. Look at her and then look at me. I'm over here almost every day, cooking you breakfast and talking with you, counseling you. Yeah, but you're my dad, so you should enjoy doing those things. And I do, but you should have somebody else doing this for you, a companion, not your dad. Baby, life flies by. And you're going to want someone to spend it with. Uh uh, I thought I'd told you to give me my key back. Hey son. How you doing pops? I'm good. She did tell you to give her key back though. Yeah, but you know, I never listen to nothing she tells me to do. I'm serious, Abdul, God. You ruin everything in my life. No, you ruin everything in your life. Don't put that on me. You knew I was dating him, huh? And you just didn't want to see me happy. Wait a minute, first of all, you date all kinds of people. How I'm gone keep up with that? Man, you just like mom. You know what, stop saying that! Both of you guys just get out right now. Get out? Hey, well look, Not before I get some of this strong coffee though. She's tripping. Yes she is, I've been up for 50 hours. Not 50 Hours, son. Absolutely, I need that dark, dark. Should have known you was coming over. Hey E-rock, how you doing? Definitely not to see you. Come on in man. Have a seat. Thank you, Mr. Lau. Call me James. James. You want some breakfast? No, no, thank you. I really just need to see Jewel. I've been calling her, she blocked my phone calls and she's not answering any unknown numbers. That sounds about right. That sounds like Jewel. Jewel is really special to me. And I need her to know that. You don't even know her though. I know enough about her to know that I'd like to spend more time with her. See where we'll go. I like you, E-rock. You remind me of me, when you know, you know. When I first met they mama, I knew she was the love of my life. Who didn't love you back. Boy, shut up. Maybe not the way I wanted her to, but it didn't stop the way I felt about her. I made a lot of mistakes in my life. We all have. Made some bad choices, ended up in the pen. That's understandable. But the good thing that came out of all of that was silence. Preach! I was able to really think about what I wanted in life. Thanks to me, who saved your life, time and time again. And I appreciate that, bruh. Look, I kept my distance from, from everyone. Cause I didn't want the constant pressure of this for that. You know that's not realistic up in there, man. You need people, c'mon, man. And you did look out for me. You know why I looked out for you? 'Cause I remember your big head ass from running around in these streets. You remind me of me when I did my first bid. Look, I haven't been completely open with you about this or my past. Because I wanted to keep the past in the past. Where it should be. But Jewel holds on onto the past. And I'm willing to tell her anything that she wants to know. And after hearing everything, if she doesn't want to be with me, then so be it. I'll be at peace knowing that I gave her what she wanted, and that's honesty. Amen. And how do you define honesty? Unrealistic. Until I met you. Ever since the first time I saw you, I got a feeling that I really can't explain. I knew one day I would ask you out. And I knew that would be my only shot to show you who I am and how the little things about you matter. How you could see the best in yourself and the best in somebody that probably wasn't your usual type. Ain't no probably to that. And to show you that you worth more than a bunch of dozens of first dates. I'm ready to tell you everything in order to get another shot. I thought being 100 was what you were all about. And you're right. Look, I should have been upfront about everything. I just wanted you to know this side of me. You know what? Starting from today, just be yourself. Okay? That might be a little bit too much. Oh, what the hell? When you know, you know. Jewel Lau, would you allow, would you make me the happiest man in the streets, and marry me? If I'm being 100 with you right now, I never met anyone like you. And I say it was a big coincidence that we were meant to be. Two shells in the sand. I will make you the happiest man on these streets. She said, yes! That's a yes! I'm not crying, you crying! I got a son named Abdul, and a son named E-rock. Life is good. Well, if it's all right with my lady, my wife, I'd like to just elope, save our money, invest it in our family business, build a unit and a legacy. All day, everyday, baby. Let's build a legacy. Whoooo! That's what I'm talking 'bout. Build this legacy, a family unit, a real family. Oh my God, we celebrating! Who wants some sweets and grits? Come get it. Marvin Gaye, come and get it. Boy, I'm finer than a mosquito ding-a-ling, boy. Yeah, how I look, Bland? Like your mama regret having you. You look like a disco pallbearer, man. Come on, you gone make us late. How we gone be late? We only skipping a few steps. Step a few times with them socks on, man, get your church socks right. These my lucky socks. Look like you play backgammon on 'em, come on. Why you see my socks, anyway?

Dearly beloved, in Genesis chapter two, verse 24, It reads that a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast unto his wife and they shall become one flesh. E-rock, do you take Jewel to be your lawful wedded wife? And do you promise to hold on to love? I do. Can I, put that ring on her finger, baby. Yes.

We're rolling, we're rolling. All right here we go! Action.
