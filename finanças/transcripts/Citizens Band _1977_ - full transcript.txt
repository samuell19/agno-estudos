Well, the way I see it, you're my brother. That makes you his son. Huh? Hey, Pam! Hi, Blayne. How are you? Fine. How are you? Good. How's your dad? Oh, he's all right. That's good.

Harold! I didn't expect you until next week. What happened to your arm? A long story, babe. Oh, Harold. It's a long story. You know, when it starts to hurt, sometimes you can concentrate real hard on the pain and fool yourself into enjoying it. I do that at the dentist. I just thank my lucky stars... [GROANS] A guy come along when he did. Uh-huh. Another five minutes, I'd have lost it for sure. How's Connie?Fine. How'd that PTA meeting go? Well, she gave that school board a piece of her mind for allowing reading dirty text books in the classroom. Half and half or straight up? Hmm, half and half. HAROLD: You been around a long time, babe, but nobody makes it like you. That's because I grind my own beans. It's just delicious. It's part Colombian and part French roast. That's what makes it creamy yet full-bodied. Things getting any better for you? It's just not good, Harold. Right now, you're my only steady left. Can I help? Well, thanks, but I don't see how. I just don't have the business anymore. First they passed that bond issue, then they move the highway on me. Now that goddarn 55-mile limit... Nobody's got time for nothin'. So, now if the government's doing these things to me, I wonder why I bother paying taxes. You don't pay taxes. Well, I pay sales tax every time I buy something, don't I? Yeah, but... Well, all right, then. You know something, Debbie? It's a funny country. I mean, everything's going mobile. Now, if you can accept that, I mean, if you can swing with it, you can do anything.

I never even done three. May I ask you folks something? Run it down, Hoss. What is it? Would you ever hoist your motor home several feet in the air and deliberately drop it? I don't think so.

Well, I'll certainly check the accessory catalogue for you. Thank you. Well, it's a lovely home and everything, but who can afford it? Forget about the money for a minute. Do you like it? Sure. Who wouldn't? Well, I tell you what we're gonna do. I'm gonna put enough down to make the monthly payments the same as the rent at the Cozy Cove. Harold, I can't let you do that. But you're gonna have to make the payments now. Listen, the other day, a guy saved my life. I'm just glad to do it for you. Harold! Let's step inside and do a little horse trading.

How tall is he? Is he taller than me? Blayne, come on! You can tell me that much. Is he taller than me? No. About the same? No. Shorter? Yes, he's a little shorter than you. What kind of car does he drive? I'm not gonna tell you... I'm just asking what kinda car he drives. Is that asking too much? I don't know what kind of car he drives. Is it big? No. Small? Yes, it's small. Is it American? No. Is it, uh...red? No. Blue? No. Green? No. Pink? White. It's white. White. Okay, now we're getting somewhere.

Yeah, they're in this bag, and he's not a bimbo. [SIGHS] Frankly, Pam, I'm really concerned about your future. I'm... I'm very concerned. Well, I appreciate that. Well, if you need me for anything...

He smashed my radio! My CB! Oh! Thank God! I've been wanting to do that for months. Now, Damy, get in the house before I kick your butt. Stop whining. Oh. Excuse me. Are we supposed to wait outside for the buses, or do they announce it on the loudspeaker? They'll call us. Oh. Where you heading? Union. Oh, you got relatives in Union? My husband's in Union. What's he do? He's a trucker. I just knew it. Why do you say that? Because it takes one to know one. Oh. You, too, huh? How long you been together? 10 years. I been 12. We must be setting some new kind of record. [LAUGHING] Yeah. I decided long ago that I can't think about it and worry about it and make my life miserable, or just not think about it and hope for the best, which is what I do. Anyway, if I did find out that he'd been unfaithful, I think I could handle it. Golly, I've read enough of those articles about it in Cosmopolitan. Huh. Don't let those articles fool you. It's real hard. I know. MAN OVER PA: Bus for Union and points west leaving from dock two in two minutes. I'll let you in on something. About two years ago, I found out my husband indulged with another woman. Don't ask how I found out. I just did. Oh. Well, I waited a week for him to get home, but I kept myself at full boil. I even sent the girls to my folks so they wouldn't be there when it happened. Well, I really let him have it... Cursing and slugging and crying and throwing things, just like on TV. Then I locked myself away for two days, hoping he'd guilt himself to death. You know what happened? All of a sudden, he started being real nice to the girls, real buddy-buddy, you know? And then he starts doing the dishes, things like that. He never did that before. Then, in the bedroom one night, all of a sudden, he's by my side, doing what all us women like and none of us like to talk about. Before, I used to have to wait for my birthday. Well, it wasn't my birthday that night. And you know something? What? I didn't have it in me to resist that mother. I don't have to tell you what that loneliness is like. No. [SCOFFS] Next morning... I hear his truck start up, and he's gone for another few weeks. Well, I don't know what to think. I think about the laundry. Yeah. I think about making breakfast for the girls. Mmm. I think about the plumber coming to fix the bathroom faucets. I just sort of let the day pull me along. They've been pulling me along ever since. Do you still love him? I figure if I don't ask myself that, I won't get into trouble. Want to see some pictures of the girls? Oh, my husband always wanted a girl. We got three boys. Mmm. He wanted to try again, but I said no. After two breeches and one Cesarean, the fun's out of it, you know? I think it's kind of a sore point between us. Oh, hey... Oh, they are a couple of cuties. [GIGGLES] Oh, I'll show you a picture of my boys. Here. At their house out there in back. They look just like you. [CHUCKLES] Petey and Stan, those two... They have their father's eyes and mouth. Oh, yeah? [LAUGHS] Oh, precious. Did I just give you this picture? No. No, this one. Did I? No. Are you sure? Well, sure, I'm sure. That's my husband Harold. [LAUGHING] Oh, sweet Jesus. Huh? What's wrong? Lord. What happened? Lady, you and I have got us a truckload in common. [GASPS] Harold! Operator, try that Dallas number again, will you? Does this mean we're related? GRANDMA BREAKER ON RADIO: My father was a doctor. And he was on the Nez Perce Reservation and was adopted into the tribe of Nez Perce with my brother and myself. I was six years old. Many years later, when I was 14, we went on Fourth of July to the Cawmill Reservation. And there was three of us girls there. And there was a boat on the lake, and it was locked to the limb of a tree. And we took a hatchet and cut the limb off, and slit the lock off and took the boat, and went up the lake. Oh, we had a beautiful time. But when we got back, the Indian police was waiting for us. And my father was shot by a family who was sick over it. And about that time... I got to hand it to you, it works like a charm. I should've done this long ago. How's it drive? Real easy. God damn it! Push it, Debbie! Huh? There's something I haven't told you. Yeah. I'd like a room for tonight, please. Oh, Connie... Don't take this personally or anything, but I really think we ought to get separate rooms. Oh, really? I mean, we hardly know each other or anything. Well, I got a lot to think about, and... Well, it might look funny to the lawyers later on. Two singles, please. Harold, how'd you get yourself into this mess? You know, sometimes when you've been on the road for a long, long time, you forget just how soft a woman really feels. MAN 1 ON RADIO: Right tire. Hey, Pop! He's lost his front right tire. He's not gonna be able to move very far. MAN 2: Yeah, okay. Just, uh, if he gets out... Pop, we only got 15 minutes. Come on, Pop! What's the matter? Oh, you've been drinking. Pop! [JUMBLED CONVERSATIONS ON RADIO] Couldn't wait another hour, huh? Oh... Pop. [SOBBING] [ALL APPLAUDING] This young man is no stranger to us. We've honored him before, and I suspect that we'll honor him again. Recently, Blayne helped save two lives while operating an emergency CB react station at his own volition and expense. So at this time, it gives me great pleasure to present this distinguished Citizen's Award to Blayne Lovejoy. This award is for bravery, courage, and decency. And we hope that it'll will be a model for all our citizens. [APPLAUSE] I'm sorry that your dad was ill tonight and unable to attend. Good work, and thank you. Thank you. [APPLAUSE] Hi. The bus is waiting. I've been looking all over for you. What's the matter? Is something bothering you? Oh, I don't know. I just feel like I've been in one place too long. It's starting to do strange things to my head. JANITOR: Good night, Coach. What is it really? Well, Blayne came over yesterday. So? So nothing. He just came over. What's that supposed to mean? It's not supposed to mean anything. What am I supposed to do? Stand up and salute because Blayne came over? Listen, all my life, it's been "Blayne this, Blayne that." I don't want to talk about him anymore. You're so competitive, Dean. I'm a woman, not a trophy. [WHISTLING] Are you coming? I just don't feel like another game tonight. You don't want to come, fine. Stay here. [WOLF WHISTLE] Pam. I didn't mean it. I'm sorry. Come with me. We'll talk about it later. [CHEERING AND SHOUTING] [CROWD WHISTLING] CHEERLEADERS: Anson! Walker! R-M-N! CROWD: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. [ALL CHEERING] Hi. Blayne. Wait. Pam. I want to talk to you. Isn't it a little late? Yes, I know it is, but this is really important. Can't it wait till tomorrow? No, not really. Good night. Bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye. Good night. Homework! [GIRLS GROANING] I'm leaving the farm. I'm going to leave Pop all to himself. What? How'd you tell him? Oh, I didn't tell him yet. Ah, well, here we go again. No, come on. I'm going to tell him Friday after his birthday party. Want to come to his party? No. I got plans. Anyway, I thought you said he was sick and getting senile, so how can you leave him? Well, he gets senile like people catch colds. You know, he had a bad one last month, but he's all right now. How about coming out to dinner tomorrow night? I don't know. Pam, this was the big problem between us, wasn't it, that I wouldn't leave the farm? Yeah, but that was three months ago, and things have changed... You still have my ring. Blayne... Now, look, excuse me for saying so, but I probably know you a lot better than anybody. And if things have changed as much as you say they have, you'd probably be a whole lot happier than you are now, but you don't seem to be very happy. So, well, look here, things must not have changed very much. Huh? I mean, tell me, am I wrong? Go ahead and tell me. Am I wrong? No... You're not wrong. Hi. Hi, Coach. Vicky, have you seen Miss Armbruster? Yeah, she's in the equipment room. Great. Thanks a lot. Boy, is he ever psycho. Wait a minute. I have to go. I've got to go. What about tomorrow night? Sure. THE RED BARON ON RADIO: Yeah, you got to admit old Hitler was right. He was a good old boy. Oil and water don't mix, that's for pea-pickin' sure. Maybe this whole country ain't pure yet. Cochise, my man, you're looking at 2,000 watts of pure radio power. 1,996 of them are illegal. So any of you pea-pickers want in here, you just ask me. And if I like the sound of your voice or the color of it... I might just let you in. How can such a small mind have such a big antenna? I tell you what, I got to run to the little boys' room. So if you're good, I'll let you have it till I get back. How's that? Otherwise, you can go back to Moscow or Africa or wherever you belong. That's for pea-pickin' sure. This is at One Red Baron down. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Hi. Good evening. I'm Mr. Cole from the Federal Communications Commission. We've had some complaints about your use of the Citizen's Band radio. Illegal power, illegal antenna... What is this, communism right here? [DOOR SLAMS] This is going to be more difficult than I thought. Turn around real slow, pea-picker. You're the biggest pea-pickin' commie I ever saw. Spider? Spider? What's that, some kind of code? Spider? [YELLING] [GRUNTING] [YELLING] Run for it! [TIRES SCREECHING] That pea-picker's going to pay! It worked! [LAUGHING] Oh, Spider... Wow. I'm afraid I can't handle this anymore. Hey, Pop, don't forget about our guest today. I'm leaving Ned here till supper. I got too many errands to run. Then the dog dies. Do whatever you want. I'm leaving him here. [JUMBLED CONVERSATIONS ON RADIO] [STATIC] MAN: The way I figure it, Papa, 27, 26 hours from now, I'll be staring down that Canadian border like it was the end of the rainbow. Mercy, that Canada's pretty country. All them cows. Mercy sakes, I've never seen such beauty at one place. Hey, Good Buddy. Maybe someday we'll meet there, have a doggone good time. How about that? Mercy. Gracious. I'm buying. I can't let you do that. Sugar, I'm putting this on Harold's bank card. This one's on him. Well, all right. Honey, is this Lobster Cantonese the most expensive thing on the menu? Yes. It's only $6.95. There must be some mistake. And I'd like to see the wine list. Listen, I think we should be very careful what we say to each other. Oh? Because there might be litigation. If there's litigation, you're not supposed to talk about anything. Oh. Can I ask you something? You think it's safe? Why did you come here? He called, said his truck broke down. I didn't believe him. I thought he was hurt. I thought he might need me. Do you think there are others besides just us? I don't see how. When the man has a heart murmur, he can only do so much. He does? Well, I didn't know that. Born with it. What kind of a ceremony did you have? High Episcopal. We had Methodist. You're Methodist, huh? No. No, I'm Catholic. He wanted it Methodist. He did? That's the way we're raising the little ones. You are? Connie, am I that other woman that you found out about? I don't know. Well, then we don't actually know for sure that he's been unfaithful... Technically speaking. Let me sit on that one for a while. Which one do you like? I don't care. Well, I'm asking your opinion. I don't care. It's your part, you choose. It's not my party, it's our party now. Which one do you like best? The white one. Okay, the white one. Great, we'll have the white one with the red trim, but no flowers. How's that?Fine. And we want it to say, "Happy birthday, Pop." I never called him "Pop." What do you want? I don't want anything. I just never called him "Pop," that's all. Uh, make it, "Happy birthday, Dad." Never called him "Dad" either. What do you want? "Happy birthday, shithead?" They won't do that. "Dad" is fine. And we'd like some little trucks. You got some little trucks? Like, some trucks that are going down the highway. Can you do a highway that's in perspective with a broken white line? Little trucks on a highway and with a broken white line and some cows. He likes cows. Just, you know, few cows along the side. But no flowers, 'cause... You don't eat the flowers. You just throw them away. Uh, 10-4 there, Priest. This is the Spider. How about giving us your call letters? 10-4, Spider. That's G-O-D. Uh, that's real clever there, Priest. Uh...how about a license? You got one of those? I've got more than a license. I've got the word. That's real good, but you happen to be in violation of FCC regulations. And you're also pushing illegal power, come on. The power of the Lord knows no bounds. Do you believe in G-O-D, Spider? Uh, well, maybe we do, but what's that got do with anything? Because maybe I don't believe in FCC. Clever. That's real clever. Now, who gave us airwaves in the first place? I mean, isn't He entitled to at least one channel? Hey, who are you anyway? The Priest. Yeah, we know your handle. Mine's Spider. It doesn't mean I'm a real spider now, does it? [LAUGHING] It's all the same in the eyes of the Lord. Spider, man, pinhead. Hey, give us a break, will you, Priest? Just give us a break. There are sinners out there who would interfere with the word of the Lord, but he's pushing a lot of watts. Brethren, don't even try. [ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING SOFTLY] Yes? Yes? Uh...forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. How long has it been since your last confession? Twelve years. Twelve years? That's an awfully long time. Yes, Father. What are your sins? Um... I've had bad thoughts against my father. What kind of thoughts? I don't know. Do you wish him harm? No. Uh, I wish to kill him. You've sinned against the fourth commandment. You must fight against these thoughts. Yes, Father. Have you any other sins to confess? No, Father. You sound like a young man. You have nothing else to confess? No, Father. Hard to believe. Let's say, uh... Ten Hail Marys, ten Our Fathers. And make a good act of contrition. Oh, my Father, I am h-heartily sorry for having offended thee, and... I firmly resolve to sin no more. That's a big roger 10-4. Spider, we gone. Hey! [SLURRED] Now, wait. Fir... Oop. First, he would take off his clothes. Then he would kiss you. Then he would sit on the bed. No, no, no, no. No. First he'd take off my clothes, and then he'd kiss me. Uh-huh... And then he'd take off his shorts. [BOTH LAUGHING] And then he'd kiss me again, and then he'd sit on the bed. And then what? And then... Oop. Sorry. And then he'd say, "Oh, babes, "sometimes I been on the road so long, "I forget just how soft... BOTH: "...a woman really is." [LAUGHING] Harold, Harold. Oh! What are we gonna do? Find him, break his balls and divorce him. [BOTH LAUGHING] I'm not sure. I have to tell him when it's... When he's feeling good. Oh, God. Hello, Mr. Lovejoy. Hi, Pop. How are you?Good. Remember me? Pam? Sure. Heard your voice somewhere, too. Mmm-mmm, boy! This looks great. Yeah, smells real good, Pop. Mmm-hmm. Well, shall we? Yeah. Okay. Hey, Pop, I didn't even know we had any meat in the house. Did you go shopping or somethin'? No. Mmm. Great. Mmm. [WHISPERING] Don't eat it. It tastes like horse meat. Dog meat. Huh? You said horse meat. Yeah. It's dog meat. Ooh. Pop, where's Ned? [SHOUTING] Pop, where's Ned? Oh, my God. Ned. Oh, my God. Ned! Ned. Come on, Ned, where are you? Ned? Ned, Ned, Ned. Come on. [CHORTLING] It's a little tough. I don't think you simmered him long enough. You see how I live? In a junkyard. I know that. Worked all my life. Trucker. Now they call me Papa Thermodyne, but I live in a junkyard. This country promises everything. Sure. You never see... You ever seen any of it, huh? I should have stayed in Canada. Big deal. Missis wanted them raised Americans. Could have had a cattle ranch there. Wasn't for him, I could have had cattle, I could have been someone. See what I got? A lot of rusty doo-doos. You look smart. If you're smart, you'll go to Canada. Got to go through the woods. I'd go. I got to stay for him. Well, I always thought it was the other way around. Yeah, I guess the boys must feel the same way about it. It's mighty hard for a man without a woman. He did it. He really did it. How you doing, moose breath? [WHIMPER] Thing about Pop is he really enjoys a joke. You know, I mean, of course he likes it when you play along with him like I did. That's why I went out in the back like that. Yeah, he sure gets a kick out of it. That's just great. BLOOD: I'm looking for that Spider. Go. You want some advice, Spider? Stay on that garbage dump of yours if you know what's good for you. Who is this? You just might get your britches dusted and your lights punched out. Yeah, you're really scaring me there. Uh, who is this? We know who you are, where you are, and how to get you. Listen, hotshot, you got a handle? They call me Blood, and we just might spill yours all over the sidewalk. Yeah, well, it's been real nice talking to you, Blood. Say hello to all your idiot friends, and I'm just going to go 10-7. Yeah, well, you just better... [CLICKS] [SIGHS] I always loved this truck. [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON RADIO] Come on, Rupert.

Husbands. "Maybe we should talk about this. "I'm in the green-and-white striped camper outside. "Sincerely, Harold. "P.S. That was a mean thing "letting my cattle loose like that.

Spider, you're about to receive the best piece of advice you've ever had, so listen close. I'd leave Union if I were you. Better yet, leave the state. Uh, Blood... Blood, I'm having trouble reading you. Try turning down your music. Spider, you ain't shit. How about that? Yeah, well, 10-4. That's real interesting. Why do you say that? Come back. You've been interfering with a lot of people's lives. And a lot of people don't like it. What people, Blood? Be a little more specific. Blood, come on back. Where are you? It's open. What is this?

I'm over here. Why are you looking at your old trophies for, Dean? I'm right here. You got something to say to me? You had a heck of a lot to say on the radio. "We know where you are.

I've been going through some heavy things. Me too, Warlock. Maybe we can help each other, huh? [LAUGHS] Help you? You can't be as hard up as I am. You must have... Well, like, a boyfriend. Warlock, I have two boyfriends, but I can't talk to them like I can talk to you. You know, like, sexy and dreamy and tenderly and... Anyway, why don't you undo a few buttons? 10-4. Uh...say, uh, what do you have on? Something transparent? No. Guess again. A towel. Guess again. I give up. All I have on... is my radio. Oh, wow. Your radio. [PANTING] Oh. Thanks a lot. Debbie, that was really good coffee. Could I have some more, please? Sure.Pizza. Where were we? You said that we should think about what's best for the children. I said, "What's that?" And you said you didn't know. Shut up! You gotta be patient with each other. Now, look, I don't want to go butting into anybody else's business, but I've been sitting here listening to y'all talking about breaking up and who gets what and so on, and, well, I'd just like to say something. You know, I figure that you all wouldn't be sitting here talking like this if you all didn't really care about each other. Look, now you two just met, and already you seem to get along just fine. So I'm thinking, how about, you know, thinking about staying together? Now, I don't mean in the same house or nothing, but a duplex doesn't seem like such a bad idea. Now, that's all I got to say. A duplex? Oh. No way. Out of the question. No! I didn't think it was such a bad idea myself. ELECTRA: Oh, you beast, you animal. Pam? You're driving me crazy. Blayne? Stand by, Warlock. Stand by? Blayne? Yeah. What a surprise. Stand by? Why don't you go in and grab yourself a beer and... Oh, no! Not now! Electra! WOMAN: You tell all your boyfriends to stand by? I can't believe you. You said to use it. You said to have a good time. You said to have fun with it. Why'd you do it? Electra! I was just sitting here.

Will you hold on a minute? Electra! You don't mean Electra? Yeah... No, I don't mean... No. I'm talking about Blood. Blood? What blood? Blood... You're sleeping with Blood. You're crazy. I'm not crazy. Everybody in this town is somebody they're not supposed to be. They're all... You mean Dean? Well, that was just talk. He said it was more than talk. Well, he... He's a friend. Yeah? He said you were more than a friend. Well, that's true. So, what about it? You meant it? No. I don't know. Oh, now you don't mean it. No. Why didn't you tell me? You know, you could have told me this. Well, you're impossible to talk you. I thought I knew you. Now, this with my bro... And this with the radio...

Of course, you haven't been everything I wanted you to be either, Pop. But, anyway, wherever I am, whatever I'm doing, I'll be thinking about you.
