Rebeca, now that heavenly water bathes your body water sent from Hakadosh Baruj Hu, your connection with him is total. Like the day you got out of your mother's womb, your soul is clean to unite with the soul of the man you chose as your life partner. Blessed are you, Lord our God, Ruler of the Universe, who creates the fruit of the vine. One, two, three! Mazel tov! Thanks for coming, girls. I love you a lot. I wish your home is always full of beracha, that Ashem sends you a man like the one he sent me. Like Zury. Thank you. - Bravo! - Hurray! I'm going to miss you, sweetheart. - I wish you the best. - Congratulations! May you be happy and make him happy, too. - Thanks, Mom. - I love you. Congratulations, darling. Welcome to the family, you're a daughter to us. - Thank you. - Take care of my son. Ar! I love you a lot. May you be very happy. May you find someone soon. I mean it. Hold on, Aunt! Girls, remember Rebeca is a queen today, therefore she can't be alone. Hi, sweetheart. Hey, Mom. How was your day? Huh? Fine, but I don't how it will turn out. What are you painting? It's like a cluster of faces. - A cluster? - Yeah. It's huge, I have to get more paint. How did your date go? It was fine, he was very decent. Yeah? Where did you go? To the Grand Tao. Way to go! We had a good time, but he is very stern. Do you have a picture? I was checking his Facebook. Look. This is him. He's smiling. He's not bad, Mom. Don't exaggerate. I didn't divorce your father to marry another mute. I didn't know you want to marry again. Why would I be dating so many nutty men? - Your time will come. - No, thanks. It's hard for me, but for you... Come on, Mom. Don't say that! Good night. Good night. Sleep tight. Look at that... How long does it take you to paint something this big? It depends. On what? On how fast I am. Two or three days. Hi! How are you? I'm fine, thanks. You put the ceramic pebbles under the planter. - Where were you? - And I told her... You have to be careful with the drainage of the roots. I gave you one. The names are similar. Hi, sweetheart. How cute! She's heavier with each day! So, tell me, what are you painting now? It's like a collection of faces. Faces? Where? In Juarez neighborhood. Oh! Your grandpa used to own a building there. - On... - Berlin. - Berlin! Yes. - Really? I didn't know. Do they pay you? - No, they don't. - Yes, they do. - No, they don't! - Yes, they do! You said they don't. Well, they do. The pay isn't that good, but I get paid. Did you watch the Golden Globes yesterday? Just the beginning, with my Mom. - What about Cate Blanchett? - Right, she's a diva. - What a dress! - No, she's a queen! And her shoes and make up were really pretty! What is that bullshit? You aren't a woman. No, stop it. Please, don't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hey, Dad! Shia LaBeouf isn't Jew, is he? Mich says he is, that's why he filmed the Holocaust movie with Brad Pitt. - Yes, he is Jewish. - Really? He's doing very well with Transformers. Here it says his mom is Jew and his dad isn't. A son of a Jewish mom is a Jew. Hey, Ar! Check this out. Isn't he cute? - Fortuna! - Come on, Ar! He is super cute! He isn't super cute, he's a regular guy. Well, OK, but he is a great guy. And... he asked me about you. What did you tell him? That you don't have a boyfriend, - but I don't know... - Did you give him my number? No, I didn't. I didn't, but... You always do, I don't want you to do that. - What do you think? - Nothing, he's a regular guy. - I don't care. - Well, think about it. - I won't. - Yeah, do it. - He's handsome. - Don't start, Mom. I would ask you first! No, you don't! - I would ask you first. - Right. Think about it. The sixth day. And the heavens and the earth and all they contained were completed. And God finished by the Seventh Day all the work which He had done, and He rested on the Seventh Day from all the work which He had done. And God blessed the Seventh Day and sanctified it. For on that day, He rested from all the work which He had done in creating the world. By your leave, rabbis, masters, teachers! - To life! - To life! Blessed are you, Lord our God, Ruler of the Universe, who creates the fruit of the vine. Amen. - Shabbat shalom. - Shabbat shalom. Shabbat shalom. - Shabbat shalom, auntie. - Shabbat shalom. Shabbat shalom. - Shabbat shalom. - Shabbat shalom. Come on, Ar. Think about it! - I'm not a camel. - I know you're not! - Stop trying to sell me. - I'm not trying to... Mom, I can't talk with you. You choose it. Enough, choose everything, OK? I'm going to hang up... With Alfonso, who else would I be with? Bye! I'm sick of her. I mean, I made it very clear I wanted to choose the center pieces. Did she listen to me? - I really liked them. - Yeah, but that's not the point. She has to get it's me who's getting married and it's me who has to choose, not her. - She's sick. - She's excited. I mean, she invited all of her cousins. It is indeed a wedding for 800 people, but for my guests not hers. That's why she's not here. It sucks to leave your mom out of your hair testing because she insists that you wear a tiara. "Mom, nobody uses tiaras at weddings anymore!" I'm sick of her, she had her coming. Relax, Rebe. You'll leave and won't have to deal with that. I'm dying to get out of that house. I mean, my father is golden, I love him, but my mom is crazy. I won the bet. What bet? That I'd be the last to get married. Oh, well! Hey, please schedule a whole day for me, OK? I want you to do all my friends. Sure. How many are they? Eight. Well, that is counting myself. Eight? - Shall I count you in, Ari? - No. You won't do her, she'll do her hair. - How much will it be? - 160 dollars each. Cool! I'm telling you because she's like that, natural and free. She doesn't care. She does her hair and make-up. She's gorgeous. She does what she wants and doesn't ask anybody for money. That's fab, really. Yeah, because asking for money is tiresome. - Really tiresome. - Yeah, besides... she's very creative, I mean, she's a crack. She's a master in painting, I swear. I can't even draw a tree. Whatever, I mean, even if you marry a rich guy, you have to keep working. Right, because what if I get divorced? Bar minan! What's wrong with you? Don't be silly! - Bar minan? - That is, God forbids. Don't be silly, girl. Hey, this bit is a little loose. So, did you go out with that guy? Who? Well, your cousin's friend. No. And have you met anybody lately? No way, Ariela! Where did you get it from? I mean, where...? From the office I painted last week. Well, obviously! That's what happens when you get into weird places, in strange neighborhoods. A guy will surely like you and you'll hurt his feelings. But I won't go out with him. I mean, is he handsome enough? Yeah. Well, whatever. It's OK if you go out once, have dinner, then you tell him you don't like him. I mean, it's not that serious. What's his name? Iván. Iván... that name is really something. What's his last name? López? Pérez? Martínez? - I don't know. - What? I mean... That name is really something. "What's your boyfriend's name? Iván." It's really something. Hi. Is everything OK? Hi. - How are you? - Fine. And you? Fine. What would you like to eat? Let's just go. You've never come here, have you? No. Where are you from or what? From here. So, why haven't you come? Because all my family, my friends, my parents are in the same place and nobody ever comes here. I'm Jewish. This is my favorite neighborhood. Is it good? Tell me about your first tattoo. It was a silly teenager thing. Even the spelling is wrong. Did your parents let you do it? I never thought of asking them. It would have been a good idea. My parents would kill me if I get a tattoo. They think I'm a rebel as it is for painting. I was my family's black sheep because... I didn't want to be an artist. What did they want you to be? Well, my dad is a theater director, my mom teaches Medieval Literature, my sister is an art curator... I should have been a folk singer. But... How did you start painting? A friend from college was painting a mural... he asked me for help and that was it. And how do you get work? In fact, in many ways. And sometimes, the community recommends me. The Jewish community? No. Other muralists. Right. And... are you very Jewish? The normal. Hey, speaking of food... - Have you tried grasshoppers? - You're crazy. - Do you want to try them? - No. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon, sir. - How much are the grasshoppers? - 25 and 50 cents. Could you give me a 25 cent bag? Yeah, with lemon or plain? With lemon. More lemon. - Can you add some more lemon? - Sure. - Hello? - Hi. Is this Ariela? - Thanks. - It's Gabriel. Fortuna, your cousin, gave me your number. Let's see how that tastes. Would you like to grab a coffee this week? This week I'm very busy, what about the next? Sure, as you wish. I'll call you next week then. OK. - Bye. - Bye, take care. You didn't like them, did you? Thanks. You're welcome. - See you. - Bye. His driver picked me up, can you believe it? I don't think it's that weird. It isn't, it's showing off. Where did you go? To Au Pied de Fouet. Too fancy for my taste. First, he was a gentleman... then we ordered wine... - Wine and everything, huh? - Yeah. And he turned into a beast. Why? In the car, he asked me... to come over to his house. Can you believe it? How dare he? On the first date. Who are you texting? A friend. Fortuna's friend? No. Who then? A friend. Goodnight, Mom. Goodnight, sweetheart. - The losing couple... - We can't lose, huh? - What? - Pays the bill. Is that true Jewish don't eat pork meat? Yeah. - Nor bacon? - No. Dude, I took her to the pork tacos at Coyoacán. - They were delicious. - Did you really take her? Yeah, but I didn't like grasshoppers. Not a fan? No, I don't. They're disgusting. Yeah. OK, I'm sorry. Is the Shabbat cool? I've heard a lot about it. If the Shabbat is cool? It's fine. It's dinner at my grandma's every Friday. And do you think we could come over? - Do you want to go? - Yeah, it would be nice. What shall we bring? Nothing, my grandma's food is delicious. She gets offended if you do so. - Do you want a beer? - Yeah. - Sure. - Yes, order some. Rafa, four light beers, please. - What? - Come on! Ariela, how does your parents feel about not dating a Jew? Honey, not all Jewish are square-minded. I haven't told them. And... would your family be cool about it? Maybe. Do you think if you're still together he'll get a circumcision? Come on, Miguel! That's bullshit! - Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers. That's right! - They have food in that place? - What's wrong with her? There are snacks, I guess. Are you hungry? Hello? Yeah, no. Hi, hi. Right. Hello? Hi, Mom. Yeah, I stayed at Aline's. I'm sorry. I guess we'll go out to eat. No, not at all. No, I'll call you. OK. Fine. Bye. Go straight. Quickly and don't open you eyes. If you do, you'll break the rules of the game. Go straight. What? What are you doing? It's OK. Run, the lights will change. Quickly! - It'll be in your conscience! - Watch the step! - What conscience? - Asshole! So, would you rather... know how you'll die... or when? If you know how you'll die, you'll always be avoiding that situation, and if you know when... I'd rather know when. Really? Don't you think if you knew that, you'll only be thinking of that day? I'd rather know how I'll die... because most probably I'll die of old age. - No... - Yeah. Most probably, you'll die of cancer. Yeah, right? It's getting trendy. It's very weird. Just imagine, the students stick their gum under the table or Frida Kahlo's bed! Dad, you haven't told me. How was the play's premiere? He did good. The season was very short. Two weeks isn't bad. No, but for Shakespeare? What? The king left two weeks before the premiere. King Lear, a play's character, left. The actor we got is good, but this isn't a piece of cake. - Hello! - It's an organic process. - Hello! - Hi. - Ariela? - Yeah, hi. You're beautiful! You're a Casanova. - Hi. - Let me see your teeth. What were you talking about? You know your Dad. He says the ending isn't strong enough... - Hi, sweetheart! - Of course, it does! Besides, it's good you changed Luis. Excuse them, Ariela, they are a bit lost. No, Carlos is really good. Yes, that's right. Are you hungry? - Yeah, I'm starving. - OK, I'll continue later. - I made huauzontles. - Delicious. Go see the play, then tell me your opinion. - Sure. - Excuse me. What are huauzontles? You'll see in a while. - Iván! - Yeah? - Could you give me the dish? - Sure. - Hello? - Hi. Ariela? Who is this? Gabriel. How are you? Do you remember me? I called you like two months ago. Right, I'm sorry. We didn't talk again. How have you been? Look, I can't talk right now. I'm driving. OK... I just wanted to invite you for coffee. You tell me when. Maybe next week. I'll call you. - Cool. - OK. Bye. Here you go. - Thanks, love. - Thank you. God, it looks delicious. So, we're waiting for their approval... How is that? You're not supposed to get old until you're wise. Oh, dear God! Don't let me go mad! Keep me balanced and sane... - Carlos was very good. - Right? - For a two-week rehearsal... - May I come in? - Sure, come in! - Come in. - Hello! - Hi! What's up? - How are you? - Fine. - Congratulations! - Thanks a lot! - Ariela, she's Adriana. - Hi, nice to meet you. Adriana, she's Ariela. Iván's girlfriend. - He's Camilo. - What's up? - Congratulations, Camilo. - Thanks a lot. - She's Ariela. - Hi. Right, has everybody else leave? - I guess... - No, not everybody. - Alfredo, do you have a minute? - Sure. - See you, guys. - I'll be back. Bye, thank you. - Your character has bad luck. - I know. You always get to be naive. We all had bad luck. Oh, shut up, I saw you fell asleep. If Cordelia had listened to his dad, everything would have been OK. Well, sometimes you have to disinherit them before they do. To cut the cord, leave the nest and that stuff. We're back. - I'm Ariela. - I'm Carlos, nice to meet you. Hi! Nice to meet you. Yes, I'm Iván. We have been waiting for you. - Here I am. - I mean at the premiere! There were boxes left. Oh, unhappy that I am! It's: "Unhappy that I am!" Without the: "Oh!" - Unhappy that I am! - Unhappy that I am! Like Professor Soler used to say. What was that? He used to say the "Oh" in: "Oh, Zeus" shouldn't be uttered, but inhaled. In "Zeus!." You had to inhale. That's pretty, right? So... - So I just have to inhale. - Unhappy that I am! - Yeah! That's it. - Bye, nice to meet you! - See you, boy. - Bye. The performance was very good. - Yeah, right? - Yes. We connected with the public and it had... Rhythm, right? Yes, and musicality. I felt communication with the audience. - It was great. - Yeah. And today, you found the music within the text. - Yeah, congratulations. - Thanks a lot. - Congratulations, Dad. - Thanks. Have you got any remarks? No, not today. So? What? Aren't you going to tell me? What do you mean? Oh, come on! I always tell you everything. And you? It's nothing. Really? You'll make me guess. Gabriel. Abraham. His name is Iván. You don't know what you're doing. I'm not marrying him or anything. Certainly. They'll talk about you. And me. Thanks. Good trip. Goodbye. It's this wall, what do you think? It's fine. - Does it work for you? - Perfectly. - I'll be in the front desk. - Thanks. I'll put this there. That's it. No! I know what's missing. Well, charge this for now... - Iván! - Yeah? Come here. What is it? For the plates. For the plates? Let me see. - Hello? - Hi, is this Ariela? Yeah, this is Ariela. Ariela, how are you? I'm Salomón Cohen. We haven't met yet. But I'd like to talk with you, if you are free. About what? Would you like to meet on Monday at 12 at La Raclette so we can talk it through. OK. I'll see you on Monday. Don't worry, I just want to discuss something that can be very useful to you. Yeah, OK. Right, see you there at 12, then. - OK, bye. - Bye, take care. - Shabbat Shalom. - Shabbat Shalom. Is everything all right? I think this is fine. - This one? - Yeah. - OK. - Fine. Hi, here is your tea. Thanks. Hi, how are you? Hi. God! Time flies by! How old are you? Twenty-five. Wow. - How's your dad? - Very well. - Give him my regards. - Sure. I was very close to your mother at school. Really? You know why we're here, right? I can imagine. How long has it been? What do you mean? What about we have an adult talk? I took the time to come because I appreciate your parents. Let me tell your our story. You sure know it. A hundred years ago, our ancestors arrived to this country and they were completely broke. They didn't know the language, they had no clothes or food, they came by boat from a civil war in Syria. They were tired. Just so you know, my grandpa arrived to Veracruz. He swore he'd arrived to Argentina. Do you know how they get on, right? Adapting. Working. United. If one didn't have a job, their cousin would hire them, their uncle would lend them money, their friend would sign the guarantee. Unity is our trademark, what makes us who we are. That's what the community is made of. Are you aware you'll throw that away? I don't feel I'm throwing anything away. You are with someone who thinks very differently from us. Not that differently from me. Courtship is a bed of roses, all is wonderful, but marriage is an institution. Once you get married, you start to know your partner. Then, you'll find out he thinks totally differently from you. Trust me, this is a mistake. You'll regret it. I don't think it's a mistake. It's not for you. You're still very immature. You still have to know the world. Look, I'm sure that guy is a great. He's your boyfriend for a reason. But, why not a guy from the community? There are working guys, successful guys. Loving, too. Meet other people. You're neither the first nor the last girl sitting here. I've done this for years. Fortunately, most of them made up their minds. The rest come back with their tail between their legs. You'll come back with your children and the community won't take you back. Are you OK with that? Have as much as you want. Thank you very much. - It's kosher. - Thanks. I had my doubts, but... Ariela! Come sit with us. - Why? - Sit down. - Goodnight, come here. - I didn't offer you a drink. - What do I get you rabbi? - A glass of water. A glass of water, then. Come here, sweetheart. Closer, I don't bite. Sit here, please. Let's talk a while. I've heard... you're very committed to what you do. You paint, right? As far as I know. What do you paint? - Murals. - I see. Where? In museums? On the streets, on walls. On the streets? Isn't it dangerous? - Here's your water. - Thank you. - Thanks a lot. - It's OK. Can I ask you a favor, Estrella? - Sure thing. - Could you leave us alone? - Yes. - Thank you. I'm going to tell you about a club... One very private and exclusive. Like the others, this club works on a foundation. This foundation are the rules. These rules must be respected by the members of this society. Let's say one of the rules is no smoking and somebody wants to do it. What would happen? He'd be kicked out. And why would that be? - Because he affects the others. - Exactly. This club doesn't allow conversions or proselytism. It only allows natural members in this society. They must not be foreign. The father must be a member, the grandfather as well. If there were foreign people this order could be altered. What happens when after a while, you have children? I don't want children. You don't want to? - No, I don't. - Or both of you? Have you talked about it? It was a pleasure, rabbi. I hope you come back again. Certainly. And we'll try to attend your class on Monday. - I'd love it. - Thanks a lot. - Thank you. - This way, please. - Goodnight. - Have a good night. Have you had sex? Holy God! For God's sake! What did I do to you, Ariela? What does it have to do with you? I'll be your children's grandmother. You'll regret he was your first time and that you didn't listen. You are the one who doesn't. I don't have to! In this house, my rules must be respected. And I don't want to live with a sharmuta. - Hi, Dad. - Hey, sweetheart. I'm sorry I'm late. - It's OK. - I'm starving. Yeah? The eggs with beans and tortilla are great here. Really? OK. Miss? They always pretend they don't listen. Good morning. Would you like something to drink? A grapefruit juice, please. Sure, and for you, sir? And orange juice and we would like to order. - Sure. - Eggs with beans and tortilla. A bagel with salmon. Anything else? - No, thanks. - Excuse me. Salmon here tastes like freezer. No, I like it. It's your decision. What's up? I guess you know. All the community knows. Mom kicked me out. You've always been like this. You'll let it go and you'll know what's best for you. What's his name? Iván. At least he isn't a Jesus. Can I stay with you for some days? No, sweetheart. See you. What's the name of Ariela's friend? - Isaac. - He's cool, isn't he? Yeah. They've known each other since school. A Jewish school? No, man. A public one. Hey, have you met her family? Not yet... Honestly, I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should tell Ariela or leave it like that. And why don't you become Jewish? Even if you have to wear sometimes one of those caps to enter the temple. Her family will be cool with it. Trust me, it's much more complex than that. Why don't you get a normal girl? Man... Or get her pregnant. They'll have to suck it up. - Let me help you. - Thanks. Hi, grandma. Hi. Close the door, please. Where's Noah? She's getting dressed. What are you doing? I'm taking her to the theater. Oh, I'll give you money. - No, I've got it, grandma. - Sure? Don't worry. I don't know if my mom told you, but she wants to kick me out. I wanted to know if I could stay here. Sit down. Look... - Ariela... - It's nothing. I'm just dating a goy. It happened to me, too. When I was fifteen. I didn't know. I haven't told anybody. What did you do? I loved that guy. And when I realized it... my parents and your grandpa's parents have already settled everything. I didn't leave my house. Ariela, I don't like the way you're doing things. It's disrespectful for your mom and the family. I get times have changed, but when I got married with your grandpa I was fifteen and I by eighteen, I already had three children. This is what gives meaning to life. Do you love him? It's not about that, sweetheart. - Hi! - Hey, there. - Are you ready? - Yeah. Great. Let's go. It's better if you don't come over this week. I want you to think things through... and then we'll talk. Say goodbye to grandma. - Bye. - Give me a kiss. The Canada thing is great, right, Richard? Truth is, you were always a pushover. How can you stand him? Is maintenance included? Yeah, in fact, they'll clean it up. I have to go. These are the keys. - OK. - Call me whatever you need. - Have you got my number? - Yeah. - Perfect. - Thanks for the price. It's OK. It's amazing. Thanks a lot, Richard. I hope you do well there. - Yeah, thanks. - Thank you. When shall we throw the party? On Thursday? But I want to buy everything tomorrow. What time do you finish work? Well, it depends. I'm currently very busy in a project. They haven't sent me what I need, the client is pushing me. And you know, as always, they send me everything late. Yeah. The other day, they asked me to write the frequently asked questions. But how could I know about that? So? Why do you ask? You don't care. Of course I do, you mentioned the frequently asked questions. No, you don't care. We haven't even finished, and you get up like you don't care. Iván, I'm a few steps away, but I'll sit down if you want. That's not it, that's... That's the least you could do. I already sat! You don't like whether I stand up or I sit down. What do you want? You don't care when it's not about you. That's it. Fine. Did you tell him she kicked out? So? You told him you fancied moving out? He helped me find the apartment. Is Rebe coming? No, I called her to invite her and congratulate her on her pregnancy and she said she couldn't come. Zury told her she doesn't want his children get along with mine. Sure... With your eight children. - Exactly. - That's bullshit. Congratulations. - What? - Congratulations. Why? Your house is incredible. I miss you, I never see you. I want to see you more often. He's weird. He's behaving very weird. I did everything in my hands to make him feel comfortable... and it's not enough, I don't know what he wants. It's a goy thing. Shut up! What would you do today? - My sister's exhibit is at 6:00. - You're right. Yeah. I'm eating at my grandma's until 3:00. Do you want to do something before? What would you rather? What would you rather? To sweat mayonnaise or just be able to eat it? What would you rather? Always speak your mind... or to be mute? What would you rather? Introduce me to your family or break up? Wow! - OK. - Wow! I think that, too. We've been dating for eight months and I only know three of your friends. Only three. If we are together, it's all in. Don't you think? We shouldn't have restrictions. I promise I'll do something soon. When? By the end of the month. OK. By the end of the month. That's the camel's head. Do you see it? It means I'm going to a place with camels? - Yes. - We are going, right? - Who? Us? - Yeah. - As in plural? - Yeah. - It's my cup, not yours. - On vacation. I could have used a reading like that yesterday afternoon before my terrible date. You knew, right? Beto's son story. - He got married... - No, he got engaged, - Yeah. - Then called it off. - Because the girl was adopted. - Right. And since she didn't tell him, he called it off. - God! - I think that's a hint to know what type of family they are. Good Lord! That's when I should have declined the date, because that runs in the family, I mean... - Hi. - Hey. This mural is a mess. I don't know if I'll finish it tomorrow or the day after. Are you hungry? I'm cooking fajitas. Later. Later? It's now. I'm cooking them now, not later. OK, so no. I got the wrong paint, I had to start over... But the client likes it, he asked me to paint another in his bar. - Iván! - Yeah? What's wrong? It's end of the month. Yeah. So? Well, I don't think it's necessary. I don't need to know your family to be with you. That's easy to say, because you know them already. Imagine I'm an orphan. If I was, you wouldn't be telling me this. But you aren't. That's nonsense. I can't force them to meet you. You don't get it. No. I don't get it. Do you want me to go? Dani, everything looks delicious. Thanks. Do you want some, Ariela? Ari, give me your plate. I'll give you a little bit of everything. I hope you like it. I'll give you some guacamole. Simón... Do you want a little bit of everything? That's it. There you go. How is everything, Ariela? How is work? Fine. I'm glad, and the graffiti? Fine. What a cool job, I like it. What? Congratulations. I need to use the bathroom. What's wrong, Simón? They broke up. Thank God! - Finally. - Yeah, but... - Is she sad? - Really sad. It's the best for her. - Yeah. - Well, it's over then. Yeah, but it hurts me she's in pain. Not everybody has the nerve to do what you did. Now it's time to move on. Things happen for a reason. And trust me, in the end, it's for the best. Are you ready to order? Yes, I'd like a Caesar salad, please. How do you prepare Carbonara pasta? It has cream, bacon, egg and parmesan cheese, sir. I'd like one, but without bacon, egg... and instead of Parmesan, Swiss cheese. Of course, sir. I'll bring your order in a minute, sir. - No meat, please. - Yes, sir. Are you kosher? No. But you don't eat pork, do you? I do. Who are your siblings? I don't have, I'm an only child. And you? I have two siblings. My sister Ruth is in college and Beto, my brother, works with me. We work with my dad. We have a clothing and footwear store downtown. If you want, we can give you footwear for free. Yeah, thanks. They aren't high quality, but they sell. Don't you hate the music here? I mean it, I come to relax and have a nice meal... and they have to play a concert. I should say something, right? No. The thing is... I don't like music that much. It's a bit distracting. From what? I don't know. You like music, right? You look like a concert girl... Yeah, I can tell. You can? Well, I hate it. I'd like the salmon sashimi for her and for me, the Koh Tao, but instead of spicy tuna, salmon. - Right. - Without green onion... and kakiage on the outside, if possible. - Sure. - Thanks. It doesn't have any seafood, right? No, sir. No seafood. - Be careful, I'm allergic. - Right. I'll be right back. Excuse me. Thanks. So, what did you major in? Graphic design. Cool! I'm glad you didn't marry when you finished high school. Yeah, almost all my friends did so. And you? Nothing, truth is, I started Business Management, but I didn't like it. Honestly, school isn't for me. And what do you do? Well, I import, sell... Anything, you know. Hey, what is that? What? Something in your eye. What is it? Little stars. The ones that make your eyes shine beautifully. Truth is, your eyes are beautiful. Thanks. You know? My cousin is Ariela, too. I like that name a lot. - Do you want...? - I'll use the toilet. - OK. - I'll be right back. How long have you lived in this hood? A few months. Who do you live with? Alone. Cool. - Where do you live? - At Las Lomas. Alone? No, with my parents. Hey... Do you want to go bowling? - Yeah. - Cool, right? Yeah! - Cheers. - Cheers. Then bend your arm. - Right there, with power. - Watch out! You're getting better. Damn! That was better. Well done! There! You're up. It's spicy, but it's good. I had a great time. Me, too. - Can we meet another day? - Yeah. OK. Bye. My mind keeps telling me... - Hello! - Hi! - How are you? - What's up? Sit with us for a while. Hold on, we'll be right out. - Ten minutes. - We'll be right out. Do you want a snack? - No, Mom. - Are you sure? No, thanks. I got lost. Let me rewind it a bit. - But your parents are outside. - It's fine. - I'll get a condom. - OK. We finally meet, Gabriel. I told Ariela your last name sounded familiar. Where have I heard it? I don't want to be in the middle. Sit there, you can be together. - Thanks. - So, tell me. Who is your dad? Arturo Halabe. The owner of Santory shops. - Exactly. - God! He would always be at my house! - Really? - Yes! Make him a sandwich. - What a surprise! - Which one do you want? That one is perfect. I know him very well, because he and my brother Moi went to school together. In fact, they were friends for a long time. - Didn't he tell you? - No, what a coincidence. Well, he was always at my house talking about cars, etcetera. I don't know your mom, I only know her name. Stop it, Mom. You act like an old lady. OK... Let's change the subject. Is it OK? A little bit more, please. So, tell me about yourself. What are you interested in? What do you do? I work at... He's got a massive American football collection. Really? Look, that was my first helmet and these are all my jerseys. This is the whole collection. It's amazing. I didn't offer you a drink. What would you like? - Water is fine for me. - Yeah, me too. No way! I'll bring you a beer. Mom, you don't have beer. Come on, of course I have beers on the fridge. Your mom is nice. Yeah. No, there's no guacamole today. Give Gabriel some rice. - Do it. - Come on. The kibbeh is on his way, Gabriel. Thanks. Elías. Yeah, thanks. - Like so? - Yeah, it's fine. Can I have an artichoke? Does your father still have the stores downtown? Yes, well, we're still there. Do you work there, too? Yes, I'm the manager. How cool. - It's enough, Granny. - No, no. - Have some more. - That's enough. Excuse me, I'll use the bathroom. Where is it? Hurry up or the food will get cold. - You know where it is, right? - Yes, thank you. - Excuse me. - Sure. I told you, he's a great guy. He went to our house the other day and truth is he is a very polite guy. A gentleman. I knew you'd be a good match since I met him. You should be a matchmaker. Sure! His father does really well. I mean, he's not handsome, but he's cool. I like him. Is his handwriting good? Why? They say if the handwriting is good, so is the character. Girls! Watch out. The peas are good, Granny. I'm glad to hear that. - Give me some kibbeh. - The salad... It's perfect here. - Are you sure? - Yeah, right here. Do you want me to go with you? No, it's OK. OK. God! I forgot... - What? - No, it's here. It's fine. - Bye. - Bye. Hey... I wanted to tell you something. You don't have to do this, you know? What do you mean? Painting, to be alone on the streets. It's dangerous and you don't have to anymore. I can provide for both of us. I mean... It's not that you can't do it, but you don't have to, do you get it? I do it because I like it. Yeah. - OK? - Sure. OK. OK. Give me a kiss. Will you leave in your apartment when you get married? We haven't discussed it. I swear, it's really great, Ar. I mean, it's the coolest thing, you become best friends, you're all day together... You say so because you've been eons with Zury. Yeah, I can't stand him. I mean, he leaves the mirrors dirty. Who brush their teeth like this? I mean it, he is like a seal. I missed you. You were on the wrong path. Don't think I don't know. Here, you got a message. Let me see. Zury, could you help me? - Yes, honey. - You won't do anything. I mean, it's your turn, and you'll feed him now, you'll see. IVÁN GARAY IMAGE YOU LOOK FABULOUS WANT TO MEET ME LATER? You didn't need to bash my tattoo. How are you? Fine. And your dad? His play? Fine. Everything is fine. In fact, the season is over. Now he's rehearsing Romeo and Juliet. I won't see that one. Give him my regards. Sure. Are you still living at Ricardo's apartment? Now I'm paying full rent. Can you pay it? Yeah. I miss Laura and Miguel. They just got engaged. - Really? - Yeah. - They did. - That's great. That's cool. I don't know if you've heard, but... I have a girlfriend. Can I offer you anything else? No, thanks. No. What's her name? Sofía. I have to go. Do you have plans? Listen, we will have a barbecue to celebrate the engagement. You can come over. In fact, I have to go, too. Let's ask for the bill, then. I got you! They let them in, then start complaining. They should follow Israel's example. That's a bit extreme, isn't it? - It's just my opinion. - Please, Elías. - Let's enjoy the meal. - Exactly, just eat. Hi! What a surprise! - How are you? - Oh, Gabriel! - Have a seat. - How are you? I'm sorry for the delay. - It's OK. - Hi, nice to see you! Hello. - How are you? - Everything is fine. - I'm glad. - Enjoy your meal. Thanks. - Will you put a seat for him? - Of course! Noah! How are you? How cute! Let me say hi. - Come here, Noah. - Hi, Gabriel. Darling, sit next to Ariela. Thanks. Hi! Gabriel, sweetheart! How are you? - What a nice surprise! - Thanks. I'll give you a bit of everything. Great! Of everything. Fortu, I bumped into your friend Benny. Oh, Benny! I love him. Yeah, he's great guy. You didn't tell me you were coming. - Surprises are better, right? - Of course! You're always welcome, Gabriel. - Thank you very much. - Anytime. A bit of salad... Hello. Father-in-law? How are you? This is Gabriel. - Delicious, right? - Indeed. - I always have them here. - They're great. The best around here. Hey, how's the business going? Very well. We just opened a store in Querétaro. It turned out very nicely, I'm glad. - Great, congratulations. - Thanks a lot. - Lots of blessings. - Amen. Thanks. By the way, it's not weird to have breakfast with you, but why so mysterious? Truth is... I wanted to ask for Ariela's hand. - This soon? - Yeah. Hold on. Congratulations. - Thanks. - I'm glad. - Thanks a lot, sir. - It's great. Thanks. You'll have to make her very happy. I know. - And it's not easy. - Yeah, I know. But I am committed. - Hi! - Hi, Gabriel! Baby, you came! You look so handsome! I thought you weren't coming. Look. That's beautiful! - Look at that! - Beautiful! - Beautiful! - Thanks. So, tell us all about it. - Congratulations. - Congratulations. - Congratulations. - Congratulations. It smells great. It's pasta. Hey, pasta, you smell great, too. Gabriel... - Leave it. - I'll get burnt. - Leave it. - Move, I'll get burnt. Could you turn off the stove? - OK. - Thanks. Can you pass me the pepper? The pepper... Here. Put some in here. - How much? - A pinch. That's it. Leave that for a second. Stop it. Help me out and put the table. Do you want to go to the movies? Ariela! Ariela! Ariela, what's wrong? Do you come to the movies to check your phone? - I just sent a message. - I don't care. You never think about what you say or do. I didn't say anything. Do you know a fucking light in your eye is annoying when you're trying to watch a movie? It's only a light, relax. Gabriel, don't tell me to relax. Don't tell me what to do, that I can't paint. If this is about that, I'm sorry. I never thought you'd take it that way. I just told you that because... Why? This isn't how I pictured it, but I talked with your parents. About what? About getting married. Everybody is very happy. Getting married? - Ariela! - Don't follow me. - Mom... - That onion... You take a big one and cut it in slices, then, you put... - Hi! - Yeah, but... Hello, sweetheart. Welcome, Ariela. Hi, Ari. Hey, Liz. You cut your hair. You look great. Thanks. - No, I'll serve you. - Thanks. Thank you. You look very pretty. Did you call Gabriel? No. Call him. We broke up, Mom. You won't find a perfect man, sweetheart. That's not it. You planned the wedding without me. "You planned the wedding without me." Well, it was a surprise. I'd have loved that somebody helped me with my wedding. I did it all by myself. We are different. I know. So... What do you want, Ariela? I don't know. LIONESS - Don't think you can? - No, I don't. This is a much needed question. Are you having children? - We haven't discussed it. - Five... Come on, five? That's cool, you're six in your family. - Hey, what's up? - Surprise! Hello. - Hi. - Hey. - Congratulations! - Thanks, Sofi. Congratulations! It's very exciting! It's awesome! How are you? Fine and you? Sofi, this is Ariela, a friend. - Hello. - Hi. - Hi, I'm Sofía. - Hi. I thought you wouldn't come. My meeting was canceled. - Cool. - Yeah. I hurried up. - I'm starving. - I'll bring you something. - Yeah? Anything. - Do you want anything? - No, thanks. - No? No, thanks. - The rib eye is excellent. - Really? - Yeah. - Thanks. Iván, can you bring me a rib eye? Thanks a million. Great. - I'm really hungry. - We'll be right back. - There's so much food. - Perfect. - Here you go. - Thanks a million. - And a beer. - Awesome! - Cheers! - Cheers! - To the bride and groom! - To Laura and Miguel! - Cheers! - To the bride and groom! - Cheers! - Cheers! May they be happy. Come on, man. What's the meaning of Ariela? It's lioness in Hebrew. - How pretty. - How cool. And why was your meeting canceled? Does anybody want another drink? - I'm fine. - Me, too, thanks. - I'll get a beer. - I can get it for you. I mean it, I read it and... LIONESS
