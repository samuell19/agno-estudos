Have you heard about rude boy's story? While rude boy's dad was driving, a big penis suddenly hits the windshield. Rude boy said, "Dad, what hit our windshield?" So the dad, in hopes that his son will not have a dirty mind, said, "Nothing. It's just a fly." Rude boy said, "That damn fly has a big penis!" In a city with 12 million residents, and thousands with no jobs, people are becoming desperate to find ways to earn money. In order to feed their families, they take risks. Working odd jobs which are not exactly legal. But not all crooks are desperate, or don't have a choice. Some of them inherited their work. They are not always hungry or poor. They've become criminals because this is what's expected from them by their family and community. They've become criminals because they're good at it. This is a holdup. -I'm leaving. -Son of a bitch! Give me your things or I'll stab you! Well, not all are good. -Checkmate! -One more. -Okay. -One more. -Let's finish this. -Hurry up! Wait, I'm still arranging it for you. The three idiots. What? You failed again, huh? -Carlo ran. -Toto, are you okay? I'm okay, brother Paeng. I wasn't feeling well. If I didn't have a fever, I would've beaten that girl up. A girl beat you up? Dad, don't be too loud, others might hear. What? You're so defensive. You failed, didn't you? You got nothing. Right? Toto, if someone beats you up, if someone punches you, grab his watch. If he kicks you, grab his shoes. And you, if you run, try and grab what you can. Hat, wig or hairpin. But he cannot reach it. There's Balot. Unload those. Don't tilt it, or you might break it. Balot. Looks like you got a lot. Dad, they're brand new. We got them in QC. Cool, cool! "They're brand new, saw them in QC." Eman. Be like Balot and his guys. They made a lot of money. You guys, especially you, Eman, be an apprentice to them. You might improve. All right, you guys get some rest. Eman, go home. No hanging out, okay? Balot... thinks he's really good. He's just lucky. What luck? They're the best here in Barangay Husay, right? They haven't failed, right, Eman? Because of luck! You're so impressed with him because you're an idiot! They're just lucky. Eman is better than them. We have bad luck. I'm really better than Balot. The problem is the two of you. You smell like poop and you're fools. That idiot is lucky. He can depend on Ben and Arari. You can count on Ben? How can you count on him? He's gay. He can't even beat me in boxing. A girl can knock you down, so don't talk about beating Ben. That was just a lucky punch. I was having a fever that time. Good thing I didn't run like you. You're the bad luck here. That's why we failed. Where's my isaw? There's six. Two for each of us. Who ate my share? Him! Look at his mouth! He ate them. He does nothing but eat. It's just my second. I didn't eat it. I'm sick and tired of this life! We can't even buy isaw. What's wrong with what we do? We're diligent in holdups. I have good plans. We're just not lucky, Eman. No, I think we should think of something new. I have an idea. I thought of a plan. Even Balot and his guys won't think of this. We're going to pretend we're ghosts. Okay? We're going to pretend we're ghosts. We should have a complete costume. The blood, the white stuff. And then, we'll scare our target. He will get so scared, that he'll run fast. Wait. How can we grab their things if they run fast? No, I... I mean, the target will get so scared, he'll become stiff, then we will get his things, and he will run fast. -Like that. -Will that work? Ghosts aren't real. Will anyone believe in ghosts? Are you an idiot? Ghosts are real. Haven't you seen one yet? Not yet. But if I see one, I will not be scared. Only gays will have erection because of ghosts. Looks like it will not work, Eman. Let's not do holdups anymore, Eman. Are you stupid? Dad is the best holdup man in this town, and his only son won't be a holdup man? What do you think of... We can't do that. I don't feel like going to that meeting, we will get pissed again for sure. Here comes the Dream Team. Balot is number one again. Next week, it should be a bigger amount. Don't be lazy. You know we have other competitors. Boss, you haven't mentioned Eman's group. We will make it up next week, Onyok! You never give anything. If it's up to me, I'll remove you from the list. -Remove them, boss. -Just wait. You all just wait. Next week we will be number one. Shit! It's okay even you're last. Just don't score zero on my list and your dad will be happy. So, I'll see you next week! You three stay here. Nicoy. This is my son Eman. That's Carlo and Toto. This is Nicoy. He's new here. He's brother Nardo's son, who used to live there. He's kind. I let him copy my exam when we were young. Nicoy is the new member of your group. What are you saying, Dad? Looks like you need a new member. You've been holding up men for years, but you never improved. You can't even afford to buy isaw. But in the history of Barangay Husay, no group has had four members. Never. Yes, brother Paeng. One group, four members? Is this basketball? Dad, they will laugh at us more. I don't have experience in holdups. But I'm a fast learner. I also did my research. I learned that you can do a lot-- Research? That's useless in the streets. Brother Paeng, I don't trust him. He looks like a rich kid. Go back to the library. And study your research. It's good to have a smart member. Unlike the three of you, who always attack but never think. Brother Paeng, you should be brave when you do a holdup. But none of you are serious when robbing someone. Even a girl beats you up! Looks like he won't last in the streets. He will just be a burden to us. -You don't make anything. -Fool! Want me to squeeze your balls? Dad, we don't need another member? Toto was just having a fever, that's why we're not 100%. If he gets better, we will do better. "Better"? When have you done better? You always screw up! You are old already and there's no career growth. What's your life plan? You should have Nicoy. Thank you, sir. See, even the bus seats can't have four people together. A group with four members is not normal. Shit! We're gonna be really screwed! Nicoy! Sit in the back! Pretend you don't know us. All right. What are we going to do with him, Eman? He's going to be a burden to us. Yeah, he said he did research. Looks like he knows nothing. He looks more stupid than Carlo. Stupid like you! You're more stupid than me. -You're more stupid! -Stupid! -Stupid! -You're stupid! There's nothing we can do. It's Dad's order. Let him follow us. He will give up eventually. -I can hear you. -How many? Three. What's this? You said three. So that's three, 100 each. -So that's 300. -What? -100 each for a juice? -Yes. But we're not gonna buy. We thought you're a bus conductor. I already put the straw. I cannot return it, so you need to pay for it. Or I'll call the police. -He's stupid. -I haven't sipped it yet. Give me coins. -I didn't bring money. -I don't have any too, Eman. Nicoy, you want to join our group, right? -Yes. -Give me 300 for membership. -What? -Hurry up, give me 300. Do you have it? Yes, I do. Here. So what now, Eman? Is he now part of our group? No. It's not true. He's an idiot. Stop! Hey! Hey, buy this for 500. That's from the States. My mom gave it to me. Buy it. It's new. I only used it for a few times. A few times? Why does it smell? Stupid! What smell? That's your breath. Why do you eat poop? Nevermind. What nevermind? Just 500. At least I'm selling it to you. I can sell it to others for 800. I'll pay 80. No, it's 500. Don't be pushy. Buy it. It's from the States. From the States? This is just a local brand. Look, it was made in Bulacan. Son of a bitch! Go away! You don't have money. Son of a bitch! -Son of a bitch! -Eman... don't take this the wrong way, but trying to scare people is old school, so is grabbing a cap on the bus. I have a new plan. A new strategy. -For sure we will make a lot. -Will you stop? Shut up! You don't know anything! That's just practice. You didn't sell it? No, those kids didn't have any money. Son of a bitch! I should have gotten their skateboards. Eman, I'm hungry. Why don't we eat first? We just got out and you're thinking about food? We don't even have money. How can we eat? Let's rob a computer shop. There's no money there, rent is only five pesos. And it's full of CCTVs. Dude, try me. Just one strategy. Don't act as if you know a lot. We know what we're doing. We've been doing this a long time. Okay, if my plan fails, I won't force myself into the group. You can even have me removed. Without any notice. All right, just one time, okay? If you make a mistake or screw up, you're out of the group. I won't let you down. What are we doing here? Why are we doing the holdup here? Too many people, we might get caught. It's a shame if we get beaten up. Too many people. Nicoy is stupid. You don't need to scare to do a holdup. Especially if we can't stick with it. Why will they give their things if they're not scared? -Yeah. -We'll deceive them. Try to confuse them. That's better, it's safe. No one gets hurt. That lady. She looks like a good target. -Should I try? -Sure. But if you fail, don't bother us. Remember, no other group will have you. If you want to be part of the group, you should get all her things. All right, watch me. I think Nicoy's being stupid. He'll ask the lady to give her bag. That's not a holdup, that's begging. He's gonna fail in five minutes. I bet you. I think he will be successful. Because I can see in him all the signs of a good holdup man. I'll bet 50. -30? -Okay, I'm in. How was it? Grab a chair. Sit with us, Nicoy. Yeah, there. Hey. -There's four of you? -Do you have a problem with that? I'm just asking. You know, Nicoy, I don't know how you did it, but if you teach me, you can be my assistant. Teach me what you know. And I'll teach you what I know. -Really? -Yes. What do you know? This kid really has a big potential. I made a lot of money because of you. -Thirty? -You son of a bitch! How did you do that? Aside from your smooth face, and stiff muscles, how did you deceive her? Nothing, it's just a simple hypnotism. No violence. And you don't need to be hurt. Hypnotism, this son of a bitch. Awesome! Why did I just meet you now? Thank you all! I promise... I'll make it even better. In a week, we will the best in Barangay Husay. That's what I really like. To beat Balot's group. What's the story about Balot? I heard he is better than Ka Paeng. That's foolish! Ka Paeng is still the best criminal in Barangay Husay. No one will be better than him. From then until now. Don't you know that? There's three of them. Alex and my godfather Jack. They rob banks and never get caught. But how come they say Balot is better? Do you know about the walking St. Niño? -Yeah? -In Sampaloc Church? Yeah, the one that walks at night and comes back in the morning? They say it makes miracles. People go there so they'll be cured. It's not true that it walks by himself. My Dad steals it when he's drunk. And he returns it once he is sober. He did that for two decades. And he never got caught. That's how good my father is. So, saying Balot is better, that's impossible. He's just showing off to my father, because he doesn't have a father. He doesn't have a father, that's why he wants my dad. -There it is! -There you go. -Hey! -Spoon! Here it is! I haven't eaten like this for a while. Here, Nicoy. Go ahead. -Eman, -Yeah? What is Ka Paeng doing now? I don't know. He doesn't let me come to his work. He only asks those who are the best in the group. You don't know anything? Nothing. You know, Nicoy, we think alike. We should change our strategies. I have a good plan. No one has thought about it. I think this is the solution, and we can rob many folks. We will pretend we're ghosts. -Ghosts? -Yeah. We will dress up as ghosts, then we will scare our victims until they give their things to us. What do you think? I thought up this plan. Won't it be too much of a hassle? Getting dressed will take time. There are other strategies that we can do, right? There's the alcohol. That's alcohol! Here. -Here you go. -Okay. You know, Nicoy, we've been wanting to be the best holdup men in Barangay Husay. And now that you're with us, we can do it. Us. Sorry. Us. -Cheers! -Cheers! Welcome, brother! Miss. Here's the payment. That's more than enough. Let my friends rest. Okay, sir. Hello, I'm on my way. Give me your bag. This is not free. You have to pay me. Hurry up. They might notice. -Later, okay? -Yeah. What took you so long? I miss you. Did you bring my things? Hey! What's wrong? Did we fail from earlier? It worked. Those three are idiots. They'll believe whatever I say. They want to pretend they're ghosts so that they can do a holdup. That's how stupid they are. Why do you care about them? I need to catch Paeng while he's doing it. So I can put him in jail. Once he is in jail, my promotion will be faster. I need to help those three, so that our group can improve, and Ka Paeng will trust them more. I don't know how though yet. Hey! -Are you going to sleep on me? -No. When are you going to help me with what I told you? Which one? The one I told you about. I need money, remember? So I can pay Badjao. I don't want to reach the point where Roy Bulag will come to my house and ask for money. You don't make enough? Why don't you ask your clients? It's not enough. I do sweet talks with them. But for that amount of money? Why would you borrow such a large amount? You know, my siblings in the province depend on me. I want them to continue attending school. I'm also trying to build a house. That costs a lot. It's a two-story house. You have lots of problems. Go home to your province. Don't you know Badjao? He never forgets a debt. He will ask Roy Bulag to follow me anywhere in the Philippines. It might put my siblings in danger. Hello. Hello, Marga? Hey! Lino, why did you call? My friend here wants to speak with you. He has something important to say. About what? Wait, I'm running out of credit. Call back. Hello. -Hello. -Who is this? Son of a bitch Lino! I thought someone wants to speak with me? Oh, Marga! Hold on. -Hello. Marga. -Yes, sir. I have a... gold item here. Looks expensive. I don't know who to sell it to. Why not go to the pawnshop? Oh, no! The pawnshop might not be able to pay for it. Lino said, you know a lot there in Manila. Maybe you can help us? Okay, I'll try. What kind of item is it? I'll just send it in FB. Can I add you? Sure. Hey kid! Come here. Lino! Hurry! Hurry up! Fix yourselves. Let's get to work. What are we going to do? Nicoy is not here. Let's do hypnotism like he said. To, let's take a break. I'm throwing up my guts. Hypnotism? All right. Eman. Where have you been? We've been looking for you. You disappeared. Sorry. I got drunk last night. I really had a headache. I'm sorry. Where's Toto? Over there! Hey, kid! -Are you sleepy? -No. Why? -You're sleepy. -No, I'm not. Look into my eyes. You will fall asleep. You will fall asleep. You will fall asleep. You will fall... You see this? Nice, right? Look at it, okay? Like that! Dumb son of a bitch! -What happened? -You failed! I thought hypnotism works? It worked on you, right? You're making us fools. Son of a bitch! If I pointed a knife at the kid, -I would have gotten his things. -Or he'd beat you up. You want me to rip your ass? We failed again. I thought we were improving. You're just making us fools, right? We made some money last night. But we spent it all on alcohol. What are we going to give my dad? What happened to the money? I paid before I left. What did you pay? You took off. We used the money you got from the holdup. I used my money. It was too much. -Really? -Yes. I gave it to the lady. Son of a bitch! Shit! Shit! I have an idea! Hypnotism only works with Nicoy. Because he's good looking. Unlike us, just one look and no one trusts us. Maybe you're right, Eman. Yeah. We should try to scare people. We will pretend to be ghosts. I'm sure it will work. Eman, it might be hard right now. Still early. No one will believe that ghosts come out in the morning. Stupid! We are doing it at night. Ghosts! Are you sure we are going out at night? Isn't it dangerous? Someone might rob us. I've been waiting for you! Are you hungry? Let's do this quick. I need to go somewhere. Was it good? So much! Nothing can be better. -Let's do one more. -No, it's okay. -I think you're time is up. -No. -My time is open. -No, it's okay. But I know something that you might like. What? A penis. Son of a bitch! You're gross! No, I'm serious. I don't like a penis. Even a golden penis? I thought you didn't like penises? Do you know whose penis this is? This is not an ordinary penis. This is the long lost Golden Phallus. It was carved from Datu Puti's penis. He offered it to the lady he loved, and asked her to marry him. But before their wedding day, foreigners attacked them. Datu Puti died from fighting. The lady ran away. Holding on to the only thing he left her. His name is Datu Puti? He was named after a vinegar? The lady buried the Golden Phallus. She died without telling anybody where she buried it. Why did she take it if she was just gonna bury it? -You're story doesn't make sense. -Right now, it is worth ten million. Ten million? Where did you get this picture? A farmer I know sent it. They dug it in the province. -Wait, ten million? -Yes. But be careful. Don't tell anyone how much it's worth. I will buy it from them for one million. And I will sell it for ten million. Don't worry. I'll buy you many expensive jewelries. You will get 10 million and you will just give me jewelries? What do you want? One million. -One million? That's too much! -Too much? If you can sell it for ten million, you will still have nine million. If you don't want it, I'll just find a new buyer. No, you can have one million. Anything for you. Can they come in one day? -I will tell them. -Yes! We're rich, my loves! We're rich! Please have it ready. -Are you done, sir? -Yes. What the... What happened? Why did you hit me? I don't know, sir. I'm far from him. I didn't hit him. Brother. Ouch! Why are you hitting me? Ouch! He's crazy. Don't hit me. You broke it! Hey, you broke my face! Open your mouth. Mom, open. You want to die of hunger? JJ SPECIAL PORK RINDS Pork rinds? Mom. You shouldn't be eating that. Oh! I forgot! My boss hasn't paid me yet. Come back next week. Nene, how are you? You look good. It's different from what I heard. I heard you lost a lot playing poker. Can you tell Badjao I'll pay next week? I'm really broke. You saw my mom. She's in serious condition. I can't buy her medicines. Your mom. She's a bad person. She will not die soon. If you don't pay Badjao, you might die before her. I'll pay next week. Promise, I'll pay. Why don't you tell Badjao yourself? He's invited you to the shop. Now? I can't. There's no one to look after my mom. Let me see, you can go see Badjao and I'll look after your mom. Everyone thinks he's called Roy Bulag because he's blind in one of his eyes. But the truth is, it's 'cause he gouges out the eyes of those who can't pay Badjao. Mom, I need to go for now. Bye, Nene. Eman, I'm hungry. Where are we going to eat? Eat? Can you afford to buy anything? We didn't make anything, because you screwed up. You should have let the car hit you to make it look real. Wow. As if you robbed that kid. You failed as well. You can't even fool a kid. I'll be back. My stomach hurts. I need to go to the bathroom. Eman, let's get out of here. We can't buy anything. Let's eat at the eatery. I want to eat tinola with lots of sayote. Sayote? You should put papaya in tinola. Papaya in tinola? Yuck! Stupid! You only put papaya in tinola when you can't buy sayote. My mom did that when I was young. You're mom is stupid. She put fruits in your dish. You guys should be punished! You are both failures! We can't eat something good because we don't have money. We need to come up with something new. Something people haven't tried yet, not thought of yet. It should be scary. You guys don't listen to me. We should do my plan. To pretend as ghosts? Yes. We won't lose anything, and nothings worked out yet. Hi, Nicoy! Why? Grumpy. Can't I miss you? Come on. I'm in the bathroom. Why aren't you in good mood? My group is stupid. I won't get anything. You know, I know something that can help you. -What is that? -Remember Mr. Santos? On Wednesday, he is going to buy an expensive item from a group of farmers. Maybe you can rob that group? You can have the money. I'll have the item. Hey, Marga! Maybe you're forgetting, I am a cop. If I find out you work with them, when you get caught, I won't save you It's up to you. I'm just trying to help. It's one million. Maybe that can help with your mission. You're fooling me. You just want the item. What is it? It's an antique. I'll sell it too. I was thinking, I need money. You need a holdup. It's a win-win situation. If you don't want it, it's fine. All right. Those idiots might be looking for me, might be doing something. All right. You took so long to take a dump. I'm so hungry. I'm sorry. I had a really bad stomach. But I pooped a lot. I'm hungry. Where are we going to eat? We don't have money. Don't worry. Carlo got something. Don't worry, Nicoy. This is our last day being beggars. We will eat anywhere you want tomorrow. Really? You have a plan? I have an idea. We will make big bucks tonight. I've already played it in my mind what will happen. We will become a legend. This holdup will be the best in history of holdups. -Okay. -Here. I'm full. You know I can... have a lot of coffee in a day, right? A lot. That's why... I sleep only two hours every night. Now, you may ask why don't I lessen my coffee intake. Maybe it's because I really like it. To be honest, I really don't like coffee. Damn, so bitter! I sleep late not because of too much coffee. I try to drink more coffee because I don't want to sleep. Because when I sleep, I see the people I killed, or I asked to be killed. I see them in my dreams. I see them rising from their grave. Their skins are decaying. Drooling like crazy dogs, ready to eat me. I'm surrounded by them. Everywhere I go, everywhere I run, I can see them around me. Badjao, how about you stop killing? Don't worry. I won't kill you. I don't want more enemies in my dream. I just ask Roy to blind those people who wronged me. Anyway, where's my money? About that... I wanted to ask for an extension. Oh, come on. When you borrowed money from me, you said you really need it because your mother is in the hospital. She needs treatment. I lend you money right away. But I heard you used the money for gambling. Now you're asking for an extension. One more week, I promise. What can I do if you can't pay? Wait, my boss will come into a lot of cash soon. -I will pay double. -What? I'll pay double. Triple. Make it triple. If you don't pay your debt, I'll ask Roy to gouge your eyes out. And your mom's eyes too, but just one of your mom's. Because I want her to see you suffer. -Is that clear? -Yes. Kid, give us your things. Else I'll eat you. Kid, give us your things. Else I'll eat you. Eman, what are you doing? Grab the bag. -Eman, grab the bag. -Son of a bitch, kid! Give me your things, or I'll eat you! -Kid! -Kid! -Kid! -Kid! Shut up! Eman, don't think about it too much. Let's make it up next time. Carlo, why didn't you grab the kid? He wouldn't have been able run away. It's hard to see in my costume. Why didn't you chase him? How could I chase him? Have you seen a white lady that runs? I give up. Eman? I give up. Let's stop this. What do you mean? Eman. -Eman. -Eman. Harder. That's it. Ouch! Blind people give really good massages. Ouch! Is it good? -Just relax. -Shit! Your shoulder is so sore. That's stress. Put it. You can have it. Ka Paeng. Cholo! Why are you here? How's your mother? Still my mom. Ka Paeng, I need your help. I will accompany my boss to the bank. We will do a withdrawal, and bring it to the warehouse. He's meeting someone there. He's going to buy an item. Okay. I need you to hold us up before we reach the warehouse. It's going to be a long drive. You'll have plenty of time. We can split the money 50-50. How much is he going to withdraw? One million. When? Let her go! Come on. Show some respect to a girl. I don't think she will run. Will you, Marga? Where's my money? I haven't got it yet, Badjao. You know what I do to those who can't pay on time, right? Maybe you can give me an extension, Badjao? Next week, I promise. Always promising. You're always like that. -Bulag. -Wait. I have information. Wait. I have information that you will be interested in. Okay. What information? Someone will sell something tomorrow afternoon. There's a group of farmers who will sell an item to my businessman friend. What item? Sculpture of Datu Puti's penis. Do you think I will be interested in his penis? Go ahead, Bulag. -It's worth ten million. -Wait. Ten million? Yes. They call this item Golden Phallus. It was made from pure gold. But my friend will only give one million to the farmers because they don't know its real worth. I want a commission. Your eyes will serve as the commission. Tell me about the information. I will not gouge your eyes out. Just five percent? Tell me where and when. And then we will be even. But never show up in front of me again. Is that clear? So, where? What time? Tomorrow. 2:30 p.m. at an old warehouse in Sampaloc. Thank you. Bulag, call Balot. Eman! Eman! Let's eat isaw! Eman! Eman! Eman! Eman! Get some rest today, don't go out. It's too hot. If you get hungry, there's food downstairs. I'm going out. Me and Onyok have work to do. I quit smoking. Eman said it's bad for the health. That son of a bitch! He thinks he is a mother. Has this happened before? Eman suddenly quitting? That's why I can't believe it. Even if they laugh at us, even if we fail all the time, he never gives up. Carlo does. He's a coward. He doesn't like doing holdups. But Eman, he's been my best friend since we were small. He's the most determined man I know. He works hard, so that he can be like his father. That's Eman's dream. To make Ka Paeng proud of him. Eman! Eman! Eman! Eman! Eman. I have a job for us. Someone gave me an information. There's a businessman who'll meet with a group of farmers to buy an item. We can make one million. We can rob them. So? Let's do it! We can do it. it's just a businessman and some farmers, right? Eman! You know, Eman, I know a singer from Quezon City. They always make fun of him because his voice is too high. All the singing contests he joined, he always lost. Because he has a unique voice people laugh at him. But he never gave up. He continued on. Because all he wanted was to be an excellent singer. He used his unique voice to become popular using his own style. And now, he is popular and one of the best singers in the Philippine history. That's L.A. Lopez. I have come back In your warm hugs Just like a longing bird In a nest I experienced sadness When I left you No one has ever experienced I have come back And saw you again I will never Leave again Because with you in my arms It feels like the heavens I also embrace Your smile When is that job? There you go! Later today, in Sampaloc, Eman. This is big time! I'm sure if we get this, we will be the best. One million, one time, big time. All right. But let's go to Toto and Carlo first. I think I need to apologize to them. You don't need to. There. Listen up. Here's our plan. -This is us, right? -Yes. -What is this? -I don't know. That's your slippers. Now what? Let's do it? I thought they were farmers? Shit! They're hustlers! That's the information I got. Eman, I have a bad feeling about this. Let's go home. -This is dangerous. Let's go! -What? We're already here, you're being a coward. I'm not gonna let us fail again. This is where we can prove that we can do holdups. Have you heard about Rude Boy's story? Not yet. One night, Rude Boy entered his mom's room. He saw his mom naked. Her legs were spread. He asked his mom, "What's in between your legs?" His mom had to think. She doesn't want to... She doesn't want him to have a dirty mind. His mom said, "This is a wound, son." Rude Boy said, "Shit! That wound is right in her vagina!" Shit, wound right in her... Where are we going to rob them? At the warehouse. I thought you and Cholo agreed to do it before they go to the warehouse? Think about it, if we do it at the warehouse, we can get the money and the item. We will make double. Why did you bring this? We don't have guns. You didn't bring anything else? I did. A sickle? There they are. Get ready. Are you Mr. Santos? Yes, I am. I think that's Balot and his group. What are they doing here? How can I be sure that you are Mr. Santos? Where's the money? Where's the penis? Money first, then the penis. Okay, relax. Show him the money. Give me that. Cool! How about showing us? I can't see. Be careful. There are a lot of people who do holdups in Manila. Thank you. Yeah! Success! What are we going to do? Let's just go home. We're already here. Don't be a coward. Let's forget about ours. Let's go after those farmers. Besides they have the money. -Let's wait for a bit. -We can't. I need the item. I promised to give the item to the person who gave the information. What do you want me to do? Balot has it already. We can't do anything about it. We have money! How about this, you follow those farmers and I'll follow Balot. What, and then you'll rob Balot? Stupid! No, whatever! I'll wait for now. I'm sure they will go to the hideout. I just need to be there before they do. All right. Let's do it! Are we still far, Cholo? Sir? We are close. What happened? What took you so long? Relax. We will follow them inside. -What are you doing? -Let him do it. Do you need to do this? Yes, so that you can play innocent. Wait a minute. Don't do that. There you go! What do you think they are going to buy? Drugs? I don't think so. Cholo's boss doesn't look like an addict. He looks like a pastor. -What if it's drugs? -Well, we will just get the money. I don't like drugs. That's not good. Looks like we are too far. Is there food here? Eman. Don't worry about it. We will buy some. We just need money. We are rich! We have a lot of money! Don't waste your money on alcohol! It's my first time seeing 1,000 peso bill. Vic Sotto looks good when he was young! What? Wait. Please pull over. Over there. Let me see. Marga. She set us up. -What are we going to do, Eman? -We will get what we talked about. Son of a bitch! I knew it! We cannot trust that bitch! Drive! I know where that bitch lives! I will peel her skin off! And put salt on it! And she will tell us where our money is! Wait! Okay, let's go! Wait for us, okay? Wait! Wait! Go back! Go back! Hurry! What are you waiting for? Follow them! They didn't show up. So, what now? Back to the original plan. Put down the guns. Kick them over here. Please hand me the bag. It's taking too long! What happened? Marga set you up, sir. No. This can't be. There must be a better explanation! Sir, you might be forgetting. Marga is a criminal! Think about it, sir. She set you up! I will kill her! Untie him! Sir, I was going to warn you. Was going to fight back. I don't care! Drive! Okay. Where to? To Marga! She's on the second floor. Don't worry. We will get our money back. Get out! Pay the fare! Thank you! Where's the money? -Can you see it? -They don't have anything! -Are you sure? -They're not holding anything. The money is in the car! Yes! This is our chance! -So, are you ready? -Sure! -To, you go first. -Stupid! Why me? Hold on, I'm coming. Mr. Lino! How are you? -You son of a bitch, Marga! -Ouch! Wait! -Where's my money? -What money? -Where's the money? -I know nothing about it. Brother, I'll handle it. Hold her. No! -Don't move! -You shit! Help! -Shut up! -Take care of it! Once I'm done with you, I'll find out if you really... don't know about it. It's true! Tos! Tos! You do it. Check it. Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Your plan! Hello. Where are you? Why took so long to answer? Just relax. We're heading back to the hideout. Meet us there. Put down your guns! You son of a bitch, Marga! Tell us where it is, or I'll kill you! What did you say? Remove the gag. I know where the money is. And the sculpture. I'll show you. Just don't kill me, please. BADJAO'S AUTO SHOP BADJAO'S AUTO SHOP No one's here. Check that out. Hey! Where's your boss? Who? Badjao or Bulag? -Badjao. -He left. -How about Bulag? -He left as well. Wait! -Where did he go? -Who? Badjao or Bulag? -Badjao. -I don't know. -How about Bulag? -I don't know that as well. -What time did they leave? -Who? Badjao or Bulag? -Badjao! -I don't know. -How about Bulag? -I don't know that as well. All right, we will just wait inside. Who? Badjao or Bulag? -Son of a bitch! Stupid! -Hey! Shit! What happened? Is that Eman? Hello, Badjao. We have a problem. Ka Paeng is here. Looks like Balot doesn't have a plan to give you the item. Paeng? Looks like we have a visitor. Badjao! How can I help you? How are you Paeng? All dressed up. Where have you been? Work? No. Onyok and I went to the mall. I'm already retired. What work are you saying? That's what I know, but I heard different. The gun. Give it to me. Oops! Slowly. Onyok, the bag, throw it as well! Throw it here! That's it! Where's the penis? What? What penis? The Golden Phallus! Whatever! The item! Phallus? What is it? Bulag, grab the bag. You two, sit down! So you don't have the penis? What penis? I don't know what are you talking about. Let's wait for Balot later. Bulag, tie them up! We are rich! Son of a bitch! I'm excited to shove the money on Balot's face! That son of a bitch! I'm telling you... I'm telling you. Where are we now? Why did we come here? Wait, does Nicoy have the item? For sure! Even if it's Balot, Nicoy is good. -Yes. -I can see myself in him. If not for him, we wouldn't be able to do this job. That's right. That's a lot! Where is it? Which one? The bag of money! -It's missing! Someone took it! -Don't think about it! All that money is fake! But don't worry, Marga will take us to where the money is. Right, kid? -Marga! -Yes! Wait, pull over here. You'll get the money here and the Golden Phallus. Set me free, please. I'm not going to set you free unless I see my money! Son of a bitch! I will put you all in hell, if you don't give my money. You son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Oh, don't be shy! Since you're here, have a seat. Shit! This is an all new level to conspiracies! You are all in on this! Badjao, you have the money now. That's one million. Take it home. No one will stop you. I don't care about that money. I want the penis. I mean the Golden Phallus. The penis item. What is it? I don't know about it. Phallus? -We don't know anything. -You know, Paeng, you really think you're smarter than me? You think you can outsmart me? Just shut up. What? Dad, what's happening? Paeng, is he your crazy son? He's grown up. Eman, that's the same as our bag. Oh, yeah. Be quiet! Bulag, get the bag. Give me the bag. To! Untie me. Hurry up! Hurry! Not that! Oh, my God! You're so stupid! That's our holdup! No need to count it. It's one million! Eman, no! One million. One million play money. Bulag, give it back to them. They might need it later when they play holdup. Badjao, that's enough. Your stupidity is a true legend! I thought it's just hearsay, but it's true. That's enough, Badjao! When your wife was pregnant with him, what did she crave for? What drugs did she take when she was pregnant? Maybe, she craved for drugs, huh? Badjao! You son of a bitch! Make sure I'm dead here, else, I'm gonna kill you for sure! Son of a bitch! There! This is what all of us are waiting for. The one who has the gold. You really think you're smarter than me? What's this, Badjao? Stop it! We already know. Don't act innocent! You fooled me! You all fooled me! Badjao, I really don't know -what you're talking about. -Stop, Paeng! -Badjao! -Don't take that out! Put your gun down! Are you going to give me that item or shall I blow your dad's brains out in front of you! Nobody move! Go ahead, Nicoy! Shoot these two! Sit! Sit! I'm a cop. Wow! Lots of surprises tonight! What is this? A prank show? You're brave, kid. A newbie cop against us great criminals of Barangay Husay. And you came out of a cabinet. I'm not a criminal. You shut up! Put your guns down! You're under arrest! Shit, Nicoy! You're a traitor! I thought you're with us! You just played with my heart! You stabbed me in the back! Nicoy! Put your guns down! Onyok! Dad! Dad! Carlo, call an ambulance! -You don't need to. -Dad! -Dad! -You don't need to. -No, Dad! -Eman, listen to me. I'm proud of you, son. I'm very proud of you. It's true. I always tell you that you're different from them. Because you're my... only son. But please, don't pretend to be a ghost when you're robbing someone. It's 2018, no one believes in ghosts. But you're idea is good. It's different. And you're the only one who thought about it. But don't forget this important thing. The most important thing in a holdup is fear. Those you holdup must be scared of you. Dad. Son, I have a gift for you. It's in the car. You will know, because I put your name on it. Son, forgive me if I didn't give you enough. I just want you to have your own name as a good holdup man. Not following my shadows. You're doing a good job. You're not leaving your friends hanging even if they are stupid. But you, my son, you're not stupid. I know you will be a good holdup man. Better than... Better than... Than me. Dad, wake up! Dad, no! Dad, wake up! Dad, don't! Get out of here, Nicoy! Other groups might see you here. You won't come out alive. Get out of here! Don't ever show up again! This belongs to Ka Paeng. You can have it. If you want to get back at Badjao, don't be scared. He will not kill you. He can't do it. I think he watched a movie too much. He thinks everyone he kills will become zombies and get back at him. Do you know him? Ka Paeng is still lucky. Even in death, his two loyal men were with him. Where are the other groups? Maybe they're scared, Eman. You know, it just happened. It's Nicoy. And what are you doing here? Don't worry. Dad's not here anymore. All groups are abolished. We're not going to be criminals anymore. I think you got promoted. So what else do you need from us? I just wanted to say goodbye properly. Eman, I didn't like what happened. I also didn't want your father to die. I just dreamed of becoming a good police. You got what you wanted. You got promoted. Go away. Let us grieve first. I hope our paths will never cross again. I hope so. Goodbye, Eman. Eman. Eman, give me my watch. Huh? Nicoy! You take care. What are we going to do, Eman? We're not doing holdup anymore? Why do we need to do that? We have a lot of money. Who told you we're going to stop doing holdups? You told that to Nicoy earlier. That's also okay. We should accept that we don't have a chance to become holdup men. I'll just apply to be a call center agent. That's not true, Carlo. I only said it because Nicoy is a police. I cannot say we are still holdup men. We're not going to stop. I'm not going to allow Barangay Husay's name to be ruined. We will continue what my dad started. He worked hard for it. We will create the organization again. And we will be its leaders. All right, Eman. Whatever you want, I'm in. You know it. It's okay if we will holdup Badjao. I'm looking forward to it. Damn! Me too! I have a plan. Run! What is this? -Here! -Shit! Damn! This is diamond! Put them all there. Stay here, Carlo. Do you see anything else, Eman? What is this? A penis? Shit! Yuck!
