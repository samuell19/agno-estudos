That's how you're watching over your lady! The child does what she wants! She could have calluses from all the watering! ♫ Tell me, blue sky, ♫ ♫ where are the white clouds flying? ♫ ♫ For whom am I, for whom am I watering the morning flowers? ♫ ♫ For whom am I, for whom am I watering the morning flowers? ♫ The princess is coming. Princess… About, face! My precious daughter! Lada: My dear daddy! Nanny: Look, here she comes! My daughter, what an idea to smear your hands with dirt? I've been telling you since you were little that you should wash your hands well. You should be wearing ladies gloves, wearing a hat and a parasol. Lada: A parasol? That's not for me! I love flowers and the orchard. Now command all the people in our country to water flowers in the morning. One who sees a beautiful rose in the morning cannot be sad during the day. (trumpets) My daughter, soon you'll be able to advise your own husband. Advise my own husband? But I don't have one. You will have one! In an instant! Today, great honour will be shown to us by your suitor, king Kazisvet [ruin world]. He is a powerful ruler in his country, and I've known him for years. Have mercy, Daddy! I do not want to marry Kazisvet. He is kind, my daughter! You'll know soon that in marriage you will agree. Kind? Only at the beginning! A new broom sweeps clean. You are, nursemaid, a bit impertinent. Princess will have a hardship with him. I know what kind of person he is. He has a cellar full of gold! And precious jewels! It's too much beauty to take in at once. But, just between us, he is himself as ugly as an ape. King: Be silent! Nanny: I'm saying nothing. King: So say nothing! Nanny: Alright. King: What is it? Nanny: Nothing. King: Did you want something? Nanny: No, I just. Very well! Behold, my daughter, king Kazisvet is... Nanny: An ape! King: Out! Nanny: I'm going. Accursed devil! Look, my daughter, he has money. And he's certainly no ape. Nanny: Well then he's a long-eared ass! Out! What do I do, my dear nursemaid? I would advise you something. First, we need more time. Myself alone, myself alone. So where are you? My beautiful princess. Please allow me to lay down precious treasures by your feet. Gold, silver, pearls, a chest full of gems, crystal vases bowls made of porcelain, lace from Brussels rare furs, statuettes carved from genuine ivory. I bought it all and brought for you, I, Kazisvet the Sixth, king by God's will. King, for these precious gifts you have my thanks. However, I don't like them, I don't accept them. My dear daughter! What are you saying? So you do not want to become my wife? First you would have to give me three pairs of beautiful dresses. Kazisvet: Beautiful dresses? Lada: The most beautiful on earth. Very well, my seamstresses will sew them. What dresses do you want? The first dress should be like the morning sun, which shines above the lake at dawn. It is sewn from beams of light and mist, it glistens with the morning dew. Write! Let the second dress be embroidered by light itself. As a summer day when the sun's blaze is hot. Light as a feather falling into water. Let them cut it from the summer sky. Kazisvet: Write! And the third dress? Let it be like the sky, when dusk comes in the evening, may they only sew it from the warm summer night, light as the tones of a distant song. I will have the dresses that you want made for you. And then you have to become my wife! What do you think? Will he bring those dresses? Nanny: I don't know. Perhaps not. Lada: But what if he does? Do not worry. We will set it right somehow. Look how it fits you. Lada: What is it? Nanny: Well, a fur coat. Lada: Made from what? Nanny: No one can guess. It is sewn from mouse skins. Lada: A mice fur coat? That's a lot of sewing! How many of those skins could it have? Nanny: Perhaps a thousand. Lada: Or even more. Here's a needle, a ball of thread and help me finish it. An order for tailors and all at the court: Who makes the dresses for the princess first, will get his own weight in gold. If no dresses are made by tomorrow, tailors will be a head shorter in the morning! Tailors, now you have a choice! Either a lump of gold, or an execution. King: What are you sewing? Lada: A jacket. King: How ugly it is! Nanny: I like it. King: But I dislike it. You will have dresses exactly like you wanted them, and tomorrow you will marry the king. You had three dresses made. Three dresses are ready now. I have, dear princess, kept my promise. And now they will show you the dresses. Well, what do you say, Lada? That's beautiful! Tell me, do you like it? Lada: No. They should've been like the sun on a summer day. I don't understand. They're beautiful! The blue ones will fit you best. Do you want to accept the dresses, or do you not? Lada: They're not bad-looking. King: They are beautiful, without hesitation. Surely they are not like a night under the stars. Please, king, do not be offended. So you think I have not kept my word? Princess, it's all just idle talk. You just insult me with your delays! Either we prepare the wedding tomorrow, or I will declare war the day after! Lada, Lada... What have you done? If you don't marry him, it will be bad for us. You're advising me to marry him? My daughter, otherwise the whole land will curse you. Myself alone! So that's how it should be, my lady. Wait, let me look. Beauty will not bother you. You will be ugly in the coat. He won't recognise you even if he was looking for you. You can go as far as you want, and everywhere you can slip through like a small gray mouse in a gray coat. And what if I ever want to be pretty? But that's easy, my lady. Take a beautiful dress with you. And wherever you put it on you will be a princess again. Guard: Where to so late? Nanny: That's not allowed? We're going into the forest. Guard: What's there? Spices. Best when picked at night. Let her go, lest she wishes us ill. They're witches. You will go into the world alone. Are you not afraid? Not at all! I would have only brought war to the land. Now Kazisvet will march off. Send my love to daddy and tell him he shouldn't worry about me. Take care of the dress. There's a lot of dust on the road. And here... here are the buns. Goodbye, nursemaid. Still my heart will burst with grief. Do not cry. And most importantly, I beg you, wash your hands well. And greet old people everywhere so that they see you are well brought up. Lada: I will. And tell my father... Nurse: What? That it will be better this way. And tell him that I love him very much. Where is your daughter? I don't know. I indeed don't know. I am not, sir, accustomed to fraud and deceit. If you cannot find your daughter, I will search everything and find her myself! I will pillage your country with brutal forces. My horses can trample the fields. The princess will become my slave! Instead of the star the executioner will burn her a mark! Lada: Good day. Grandmother: Good day. Grandma, to whom belongs this palace? Grandmother: To the prince. Lada: Which prince? Well, which prince... of course our prince! And what is the prince like? Old or young? What is he like? Well, he is ours. We love him. A round hand, so. Turn. Attitude. Et rélevée. Picqué et balance. Arabesque. Arabesque. Soutenue. Port de bras. Get up. Pirouette. Et hopp. Prepare. Apothéose. One more time. Attitude. Et rélevée. Picqué et balancé. Lada: Good day. Scribe: Good day. Ah, it's a rare guest. What? Have you not come to the feast? The feast? What feast? You'll see. Now there is a ballet rehearsal. Beautiful ladies have come from all kingdoms. People will dance the night and the whole day. And our prince will choose from among the princesses the most beautiful of all the beautiful princesses. Well, would there be work at the castle? Girl, girl... We've been waiting for you. What can you do? Dance. Perhaps with a broom in the hall. You know what, ask the cook over there. Maybe he gives you work in the kitchen. Lada: Thank you. Arabesque. Higher leg. Keep it up. You would like to be my helper? Lada: I would. Cook: Girl, you are bold! Do you think you could cook for the king? Do you know what kind of tongue he has? I know. Red like every other. It seems to me you're too bold. Believe me, I'm not saying it for no reason. Do you know what kind of a tongue a princess has? This kind! Girl, that's unprecedented! Where do you have such confidence from? Don't be mad at me. Upon my life, sir, a princess has the same tongue as I do. Well, maybe you're right. We'll see. Come with me now, I gotta get back to the kitchen. Once more and you'll see! And you too! So, what to do with you? You know, I cannot take you to the cooking, my dear. You cannot? Why? Well, it seems to me that you are, so to say, a bit grubby. Show your hands. All honor and praise, they are clean. So please, sir, will you let me work here? You know, but that cloak... Well, how should I say it... Lada: You don't like it? It is clean as glass. Touch it. With a white glove! Clean! You have not lied to me then, girl. You know, one of us can also make a mistake. What is the cloak made of? Lada: Made of what? Of mice skins. That's good. That is rarely heard. You say... mice? Lada: Yes, mice. Cook: Mice. You know what? I accept you. It's just handy right now. And first you will help Janek with the dishes. I'm the older helper. My name is Janek. And how should I call you? What's your name? I have no name. Call me what you want. I have to think a little bit. Aha! I'll call you... Mouse furcoat. Here's your apron. Are you not hungry? Lada: Um, thanks. You take some too. T I have poppy seed buns left. Buns? I'm used to choice meals. It seems vulgar to eat buns. Lada: At least try. Take without hesitation. Mouse furcoat, ah, that's so good! I can say that in this kitchen I have not known such a good thing. And yet I have a hairier tongue than many princes and many kings! Quick! Quickly put everything in order! The prince! The prince! The prince is passing through the castle! Pass me the spoon! The prince is passing through the castle. Lada: The prince will come here? Cook: Probably. And you... you hide! The bigger one! Hide! Hurry! The prince is coming! Line up! Greetings, cook. Greetings to everyone. When I was little, I used to sneak into the kitchen. We had nice chats together. And you would let me lick the cream out of a bowl. Please, prince. Your highness, if I may be so bold, is it true that you will get married soon? Cook, you are being rude! Perhaps tonight at the party I will choose my future wife and your future mistress from among the princesses. I wish you luck. May she be good, may she know kind words, may she be pretty... Make her hide! Scribe: What is he saying? Cook: Nothing. I'm just saying, may she be pretty... And stay there! Prince: Stay where? Marshal: What is this man saying? May she be good, and love you faithfully... Make her stay there, the ugly girl! Marshal: This is insolence! Cook: What I wanted to say was... Marsalek: You will go to court! Just let him be. He's good, only needs some rest. His head is a bit confused. Cook: Come on out, you accursed flower! Lada: Please, sir, forgive me. Forgive! One can't just do that. Did you have to be watching? Because of you, the prince now believes that I'm becoming an old fool. Marshal: Cook! Cook: Here! Our prince is calling you to him. Our prince? Uh oh! And what does he want from me? I don't know, but it's surely bad for you. Mouse furcoat, what did you want? To see the prince? The prince? I don't know. I like him. I think he's kind, honest and fair. Kind he is. And we all wish that he also gets a kind woman. And what if he didn't get a kind wife? The merry prince would turn into a a sad king. Cook's helper! Here, sir! What's happening? Cook: Watch. Janek: What? At me. Look better. My eyes are already falling out. Do you not see anything? Here. Lada: That's an order of merit! Cook: Ah, an order of merit! For always cooking well and expertly, the prince gave me the Order of the gold spoon. It's beautiful! May the people see it! You know what? I'll hang it in our kitchen. Sir, you should perhaps wear it instead. Oh no! Then it could wear down. Janek: That's true. Cook: Where do I put it? Sir, hang it on the crest among the spoons. Congratulations, sir. Lada: Congratulations from me as well. I have a small wish. Will you fulfill it, please? Cook: Just talk. Lada: May I go look at the ballet in the evening? Cook: Girl, girl, you are really daring. They will find you and then it will be bad. Lada: No one will find me in the castle for sure. I'll be in the shade, so that you yourself won't recognize me, even if you were standing right by me. Cook: Well, go then. You know, I wouldn't do it, if I wasn't so happy because of the golden spoon. Well, prince, do you not like any of them? I'm afraid that I'll always be lonely. I will become an old and grumpy king. All the princesses would marry you right away. But where is the one I would love? Have you seen the daughter of the King of Hirkania? Will you let her greet you? Prince: What's her name? Marshal: Princess Florindella. Be welcome in our country, my noble lady. Thank you. I'm honored that you, prince, are welcoming me. Tell us, how do you like our castle and our land? I don't know anything about your castle. I do not look at the land. But I am completely enthralled. Radovan: By what? Florindella: By your stables. Please give my admiration and my respect to the grooms. Beautiful horses stand in the stables. And I understand horses. Radovan: Thank you for your appreciation. I'll tell them everything, noble lady. Prince, forgive me for asking you, but could Princess Florindella be someone you like? She could not. She is very bold, surely rides fearlessly, but she would probably like her horse more than me. Have you seen Duchess Gloria among the guests? It is known that her father will give her a large dowry. In his country they call him the Diamond Duke. I have no interest in diamonds. I do not care about the treasure. So what do you want? To find a girl that I would really like. Prince, I will introduce Duchess Gloria. I welcome you. You won't tell more? That's not nice of you. You will not even tell me that my hair is like gold, that I have eyes like a child, that I have the most beautiful dress? Why should I repeat what you're hearing from all sides? Because I would like most to be liked by you. There is not a prince in the world that would reject my hand. And if I tell you "yes"? Prince: Then I will answer you "no". I'll tell daddy. You'll see what happens! You're just a kid. Whimsy and spoilt. I have chests of diamonds. Every prince wants them. Before me, everyone falls to their knees. The first princess loved horses at least. But this one only loves herself. My lady, would you not like dessert? Would you like a roast, please? Would you not? Lada: Thank you, no. Cook. Why are you going to that lady? She seems suspicious to me. And what is so suspicious about her? I noticed she doesn't like the food. She coldly turns away from salads, she didn't even stop by the roast. That strange lady apparently despises the art for which I wear the order. Lady! Prince. Is it possible? Who are you? That I cannot and must not tell you, dear prince. Think that I'm, say a servant here in your castle. No, you were born in a beautiful land far away. Tell me, how do you like our castle and our land? Your country is beautiful. From the mountains and forests at the border it seems so familiar to me like my homeland, like our garden. Lady, you appear to me like a nymph from a fairytale. You are lovely and wise. You are kind and gentle. I'm talking to you as if I was talking to my own brother. Please, lady, hear me out. I want to marry you. But you don't know anything about me. Maybe without my gold star you wouldn't even recognise me. I would recognise you always and everywhere. Even without your gold star. Marshal: Princes. Radovan: What is it? On our borders, in the mountains called the New world, our neighbor appeared suddenly, king Kazisvet. If he comes to us in peace, as a friend, as a guest, he will be welcome. If he wanted to come as an enemy I will punish his insolence! Well, will you give me your hand? I confess to you, you are bonny to me, your heart is sincere. And so it is not easy for me to now tell you my "no". So you reject me? Why are you suddenly so bad? I'm afraid that I would only bring misery to you, prince. I'll leave. Dawn is approaching. And I have in my heart so much confusion! Stay. I cannot! At least give me a ring from your hand to remember you by. Take it, it is yours. And I will give you mine. Do not go, my dear. No, my prince, I have to say goodbye. ♫ A tender ring she gave me, ♫ ♫ it now lies on my palm. ♫ ♫ It was a short meeting, ♫ ♫ she left me forever. ♫ ♫ We are defenseless against love, ♫ ♫ which hurts under the stars. ♫ ♫ A tender ring she gave me, ♫ ♫ it now lies on my palm. ♫ ♫ A tender ring she gave me, ♫ ♫ it now lies on my palm. ♫ Where have you been, you naughty girl? Wait, you'll get what's yours! Lada: I was in the castle, of course. Cook: It seems to me that you weren't! Lada I was. The Cook: That is a big lie! Lada: I was! Cook: I'd have to see you there! Do not lie to me anymore. You should be ashamed. I have nothing to be ashamed for. You did not see me and I saw you. Cook: And what was I doing? You were just going around that foreign lady. Hm. That was annoying. She did not eat a little bit of the food. What would you say to that, Mouse furcoat? Well, maybe she dined a lot before. I'm telling you, that woman was suspicious. ♫ Love is heat and bitter cold, ♫ ♫ a man is pining on the moon. ♫ ♫ A stellar waterfall rumbled, ♫ ♫ I saw a shooting star. ♫ ♫ They say a person should make a wish, ♫ ♫ when a star is falling to the earth. ♫ ♫ So that as much as I love you, ♫ ♫ you would love me as well. ♫ ♫ So that as much as I love you, ♫ ♫ you would love me as well. ♫ Janek! And what about the dishes? Are they ready here? I overslept a little bit. Don't be mad, sir. That's a pile! Oh, dear lord! The guests have dirtied that all yesterday. Mouse furcoat, well, we'll wash that. Marshal: Cook! Chef: Here, sir. Your wish? The prince will come for breakfast soon. Beware, he's in a bad mood. The soup apparently has not enough salt. Hey, helper, add a bit of salt. The prince is sad? His heart is hurting him? You ought to see him. Sitting in the chamber, no one can come to him. Not even friends! That's that cursed woman's fault! You mean the foreign one? With a star on her forehead? (metallic clunk) Of course! First she confuses prince's head and then disappears. She's an evil crook! Did you salt it? Do you hear me? Is it salty?! Suddenly everything all falls out of your hands! Girl, girl, you got tears in your eyes. Because I scold you? Do you feel so bad because of it? Lada I don't. Cook: There, see. I do not mean any harm. I have to, girl, always think of the prince. His mother died when he was young. But, girl, are we weeping now? Well, so... You know what? Now take a bite. Come on! Prince: Marshal. Marshal: My prince. Bring the cook and his helpers here, the ones who cooked soup for me. Marshal: Cook! Cook: Well? Go immediately to the prince! Cook: What happened? Marshal: I do not know, the prince just commanded me to bring the cook and everyone who had anything to do with the soup. Woe, woe... you oversalted it. It will be too salty. No, that's not it. This time it will not pass for you so easily, shameless cook. Cook: So what's going on? Marshal: I do not know. Cook: The spoon! The smaller one! And the order! Marshal: Better not take that. Cook: And you stay here! Marshal: Everyone must go before the prince. The prince could have found a hair from your fur coat swimming in the soup. Yes, yes, it was the soup! You unlucky girl! Now I know it! You caused everything with you ugly furcoat! Go! Prince, your cook bows before you. You brought your helpers? Cook: First helper Janek. Janek: Here! And then there is a second helper. Good. What is she called? Cook: Nothing. Prince: You do not know her name? Janek: I would tell it to you, prince. Cook: You shut up! She does not have a name. So we invented a name for her "Mouse Furcoat". Prince: And she answers to it? Janek She does. Her fur coat is actually sewn from mice. Prince: And who cooked the soup? Cook: I did. And she was there? Cook: She wasn't! Just... Prince: Say it fast! She just salted it a bit. Prince, please forgive her. She is guiltless. You don't want to expel her for a single hair? Prince: Hair? Marshal: What a rude man! May I punish him, prince? Radovan: What hair? Mouse hair that fell into the soup. Everything in your head is wrong. You better leave. The prince sends you to hell! Go. Go! The girl who salted the soup will stay. Cook: Grace... Marshal: Go, cook! You have screamed enough. The prince is angry with you and now there will be a reckoning! Prince, here I am. Now deliver their judgment. I wanted to kneel before you, lady. Do not hide your star anymore. Put away your disguise. Speak openly, tell me your name. I will love and cherish you, lady, until I die. I swear that on my honor. (trumpets) I cannot and must not marry you, dear prince. Even though I love you so. You can find another wife. She will surely love you. The king Kazisvet came for a princess called Lada. Apparently she was at the party and so she must still be here. I will see king Kazisvet. I'd like to talk to him. I, Kazisvet the Sixth, king by God's will, a powerful ruler and an anointed head, greet the noble prince Radovan. Be welcome, king. What would you like to tell us? I came here looking for a fugitive. Give me Lada, prince Radovan! She is my fiancee and she will be my wife! Or else… King, you want to threaten, as it seems. Your fiancée... Lada: that fiancée is me! Is it true, king, did you accept my promise? Here I am. Do you want to marry me? Kazisvet: Who are you? Lada: Lada, king! Do you not recognise me? IS the cursed girl mocking me? Lada: You do not want me then? Kazisvet: I do not! I'm glad. Who are you even? I told you. Lada. You will come with me! Why, you renounced me! Kazisvet: I did not recognize you. I was foolish. However, what are you doing here? Lada: What? I wash the dishes. Kazisvet: Dishes? Lada: You don't believe it? My lord will prove it to you. Please call the cook immediately. Prince: Call the cook! Marshal: Call the cook! Cook, you are called before the prince! Cook, you are called before the prince! Cook, you are called before the prince! Quick! Spoon! Now it's bad for me! I'll take my order with me just to be sure. Prince: Cook... Cook: Here! Kazisvet: Now we'll see. Who is this girl? She works in the kitchen. What's her name? And what would you say about her? Cook: I call her, well... Janek: Mouse Furcoat. Mouse Furcoat?! Prince: And she serves you well? Cook: She does. When she washes a plate, it shines like the sun. It is spotless. Kazisvet: Are you not ashamed?! What? Because she washes well? Idiot! Do you even know who is your servant? Kuchar: A good girl! Kazisvet: You're an ass! It's a princess! Cook: A princess? Kazisvet: Yes. I just said it. One of the two of us is crazy in the head. I do not understand what the man is saying. I say, she is good! Just a little ugly. You are wrong, my dear. No, she's not ugly. Lady! Grace! Forgiveness! Kazisvet: Princess, now you are mocking me. And you, prince, have just taken my fiancee. Give her back, or I will destroy your land with war! I, Kazisvet the Sixth, king by God's will! I will bring troops in full armor! Your land will perish under the horses' hooves! Shut up, King. Maybe elsewhere they are afraid of you, but here in our country we will not be scared! Lada: Nanny! Nanny: My dear lady! What is that villain here for? Lada: He's threatening with a war. That he will destroy and burn everything here! He already tried it in our land. My god, they chased him! Lada: Chased? Who? Nanny: All the people! Everyone! Stable boys, labourers... RadovanPrince: So the people drove him out? Babysitter: Yes, sir. With weapons. Some even without. With sticks and lances, scythes and pitchforks. They chased him and sang. Ah, what an atmosphere! Finally, they gave him a fair few on the back! What do you say, Kazisvet? Dear lady, please forgive me! You have always been good to me. I have nothing to forgive. I said that you're ugly. Forgive me, my lady. Lada: Well, you were wrong a bit. But because you were kind to me, I will now give you The order of the Mouse Furcoat. Arise. Thank you, madam. Now I will have two orders. ♫ Love is heat and bitter cold, ♫ ♫ a man is pining on the moon. ♫ ♫ A stellar waterfall rumbled, ♫ ♫ I saw a shooting star. ♫ ♫ They say a person should make a wish, ♫ ♫ when a star falls to the earth. ♫ ♫ So that as much as I love you, ♫ ♫ you would love me as well. ♫ ♫ So that as much as I love you, ♫ ♫ you would love me as well. ♫ So be happy, my dear children. What more can one wish in the world? May I take a piece of ham? I like it very much. Just take it. Now that we have peace, you can afford it. King: Myself alone, myself alone! This is ham! Gently smoked. Who made it? Please, king, I did. ?you know what, cook Now I shall confer on you the Order of golden ham! Good... And now everyone about, face! Well, so... Come on! (bell rings) And the fairy tale is ended.
