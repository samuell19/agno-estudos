1080p english subtitles: (moviesbyrizzo) Where the fuck do you think you're going? Can't you see it's red ? - You're even on your fucking phone! - Put your hand back inside... You went through while the light was red! Dad please, forget it. I'm scared. - It's nothing. Still on your phone? Did you see what you did back at the traffic light? - I've already said sorry! - You're a piece of shit! - Brother, calm down. - Pull yourself come together. - What'd you say? - Come on! - I'm talking on the phone. - I want to grab you by the neck! - You're making your son cry. - Leave my son out of this! - OK let's go! - What are you doing, are you laughing? I want to kill you! - See you! See you! - Now you're getting worked up! - Dad, forget it! Dad, stop! - Here you are! - Dad, forget it. - What the fuck are you looking at? - Get out! - Keep calm. - I want to smash your face! - Now I'll show you! - Dad, stop. - Open up! Open up! - Papa! Stop! I'm a policeman! I am a policeman! He wanted to kill me! I did nothing! I did nothing! Stop! - Good morning. How are you? - Well. What's your name? - He does not answer, is he shy? - A bit. - So I know, your name is Agilulf. - No, Funisbondo. Ah! Funisbondo! Did Funisbondo eat today? A little, doctor. I see here that he had roast chicken and fried potatoes. - If you arent always careful, you might just end up in a hospital like you are now. - When will all this be over? The doctor's being silly, this is the worst thing that has ever happened to you. - How is this young man? - Better, I've been massaging his legs lightly as you suggested Good, Keep doing it. Until we gradually have him back on his feet again. Right, Stefano? See you later. Doctor, he's still not moving his legs. Give it time. The first operation did go well. - And he's also not speaking, why would that be? - He is suffering from a serious case of shock. Come and see me later and I'll explain a few more things to you. - It's like not much liquid is going through I think... - No, everything's fine. It's fine like this. I think your colleague took offense earlier. All I was wanting to say... Not to worry, no one takes offense around here, madam. Hear what the doctor called you? He called you "young man". The bullet that hit him entered his chest and fractured a vertebra. This caused a hematoma that compromised his spinal cord. This is why Stefano can't move his legs. The good news is that there are no lesions in the spinal cord. We have to wait a few days for the hematoma to subside and then we will operate again to stabilize the fracture. - He will recover completely, won't he? - Of course Madam, Don't worry. Stefano is a very strong child, he is a fine young man. Oh, please dont cry. Come on, Madam. Now, what more can we do? I can't take it anymore. You must try to remain calm, and help him do the same. - You will operate on him, won't you? - Sure. Do not cry in front of him, he needs strong support. Alright? Laugh, talk to him, try to take his mind off it. Thats what Stefano needs right now. He'll start talking again, you'll soon see Alright. - I'll go over to him then. - OK. Good, I'll be along soon. Here we are. - Good afternoon, Sir. - Good afternoon, how are you? - Fine thanks. - My wife? - She's putting the girl to sleep. - When's dinner? - Whenever you wish Sir. Fine. In about ten minutes then please. Perhaps you could bring it to my office - Yes Sir - Thanks Hi - Hi - Is she asleep already? She's just fallen asleep. Hi - You didn't make it today... - A last minute hitch, I'm sorry. - The teacher is pretty, a bit 'old... - She sounds like she'd be better. It seems like a very good nursery, they make a bit of a fuss about their "methods"... It's not as if we're in Manhattan! - The important thing is that you like it, right? - Yes. Listen Love, I'm going to eat in the studio because I have a lot to do, but I promise we'll spend some time together after.. Okay, I'll wait for you. Hi Sofia. I'm having dinner at Michael's. Ah, thats just great I suppose. That means I'll be having dinner on my own. - Do you have a cigarette? - Don't you ever buy your own? - Come on! I smoke one a month! - Always mine. Come on come on. Thank you. - Say "Hi" to your aunt and uncle - OK Bye. [sound of crying baby] Oh no! - Laura? - Yes Madam? - Would you go now, please? - Alright. - Benny! - Hi Uncle. - Hi, how are you? - Fine. - Are you going to be joing us for dinner? - Yes! - How's it going? - Well, you? Not bad. A bit tired. - Hi. - Hi. - Hello. - Hi, dear. Michael is in his room. - I picked up some wine. - Thank you. - You're late. - I went to see my mother. She usually calls me and I run over, then she's better. But I'm dead tired after. - And tonight I have the night shift. - Wasn't it tomorrow night? - No, tomorrow it's dinner with Massimo. - Oh god, what a drag. I'd forgotten. Let's use that as an excuse not to go.. - Come on, its only once a month! - We could change restaurants at least He's taken us us to the same place for 10 years! - But you like it. The foods great - It should be, for what it costs him. Your brother certainly loves it though. When they bring us the wine list, he likes playing at being a connoisseur... - And do we really want to talk about his missus? - We don't have to talk about her. - I wonder what she'll wear tomorrow. - Shall we ask Benny? - Benny! - Yes - It's nothing. You're being silly! Oh God, look at this! - Watch this. - That must be really painful! What a beating! The other day, I was watching a Jackass. There was a guy standing there who took about 20 punches in the face! real hard punches. - What about the guy who get's electric shocks to the nipples, have you seen that?. - What a complete fool. Anyway, maybe you should try it too. - No thanks. - I want to see if you've got the guts. go on, try it! - No, maybe you'd like to try it too, instead. - Watch this! - He's gonna kill him now. Imagine the pain he must be feeling! Foods ready. It's on the table. - Coming. - I'm going to the hospital. - Why, do you feel unwell? - Now that's a funny joke. What's that you're watching? It's a show called "Next stop" Whats that about? - It's an insane web-series in which they get to beat each other up. - But it's cool. - Interesting. - Have you finished your homework? - Yeah uh, huh (yes) I bet. - Alright. Ciao (bye) - bye I do not understand how this fella we're watching does not end up in a hospital. - Why are you rushing so much? - Michael, Benny, Hurry now! There is something in the air. A calling. Look at her run! - Hurry up, it's nine o'clock already. - Outta my way. Hold on! I happen to be watching something on the telly. I thought we are supposed to run this house in some democratic manner. Oh well... - Now, where did I put it? - Please, you're blocking my view! - I don't see my cellphone. - It's probably in your case! - Do you know if anyone's seen my cellphone? You should perhaps watch something else on TV - like the show "A day in court" - Or "Killer women", for another option. - Well, I happen to think it's great! - Really? - Yeah. Not bad. - OK I'm off to work. - OK Bye. - If they do catch someone on the show give me a call. - Ok. - Bye. - Bye. NEWS ANCHOR: Some news we repeatedly broadcast to you, such as reports of missing persons NEWS ANCHOR: We air such news here as soon as we receive such reports. - Good evening, doctor. - Good evening. Hey, what are you doing still up at this time? Mom's snoring and I couldn't get to sleep. Go straight back to bed the nurse is coming. - When you take my bandage off. will I be able to see like before? Much better than before! If mom snores, go like this to her... and she'll stop. Come on, go to bed. Good night. - Good evening doctor. - Good evening. Everything went well with the kid who had an aneurysm. It was the drug or analgesic that caused the reaction. - I don't understand why they changed it. - We'll have to check into it further. - And how's Stefano? - Fine, fine - His mom's sleeping too, at last. I gave her a tranquilizer - I gave her an anxiolytic. - I'll pretend I did not hear that. Did I say something I shouldn't have? Michael, are you there? Michael? Are you playing? No, I'm still sick, it still hurts, sir. If you continue like this playing video games, you'll get cramps in your hand. Should we find an excuse for tonight? No. - Thanks, you're very sweet. - I know, everyone says so about me. - Anyway, it's absurd. - But it's really important to him. But not to you. I pretend. - Basically it does not cost me anything. - Not you... Ouch! That hurts! Do you realize that your brother is an obsessive compulsive maniac? He's really scary. I swear. I'm petrified to even think about it.. - Should I shave off my beard? What do you say? - That you aren't listening to me speak. Should I go to the barber's? Shall I have it shaved off? I better not. You deserve a brother like that! That bathrobe really suits you. Why don't you wear it to dinner? You can make Sofia look badly dressed by comparison. Are you crazy? Crazy woman... You managed to make yourself a coffee, congratulations! - Its pretty good coffee for that matter Would you like a taste? - - No thanks. - Hello dear! - Hello. - How did it go? - Normal. Normal good or normal bad? Michael, it's ready when you want. Normal? - Normal good? - Well, let's hope so... - See you again. - Bye for now and thanks. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Do you have a reservation? - Yes, the name's Lauri. - The lawyer Lauri? - I'm his little brother. - I didn't mean... sorry... - I like to joke. - Good evening, doctor, madam. - Good evening. - These folks do indeed have a reservation, at their ususal table next to the glass widow - Thank you The gal is new. Is my brother here yet? - Doesn't appears so. - I'll be with you in a minute however I took the liberty, while you folks are waiting... Thank you. Moncalieri Fassone meat tartare with dijon mustard grains. Beef "Sfoglietta", on supreme Alba truffles, and Val d'Orcia poscini mushrooms too Of the racutelle. Flavored with natural charcoal. - Racutelle. - You have to taste it. Delicious. - Should we wait on your brother before serving wine? - Absolutely. - I'll take my leave at this point - Thank you - Did you bring your scalpel by any chance? - Why? - I would cut that finger of his off. - Just take no notice of it at all. - Racutelle... just what is it? - Racutelle... it's French cheese. If you scratch off the the coal... It's simply delicious. I prefer Gorgonzola. Here he is. I wonder where Barbie is. We've already started them with some appetizers. Would you care for some too? - Yes, but don't overdo it. - For the lady too? Yes my wife is here too, thanks. - Sorry for our being delayed, it was my fault. - No problem. - Hi - Sofia? She's coming. I do hear her - she's just on her way niow. I do apologize, the owner's wife actually tried to stop me. - Hi. - Hi. - Have you already started? - No, we've been waiting for you. You needn't have! - What's this? - A cheese covered with charcoal, you simply must try some! - Racutelle. - Coal coal? - Just coal. - I'd think I'd like to try some. It's true! - How weird! - Did you like it? You know, our days could perhaps even be numbered without us being aware of it - This allows us to live without the anxiety of knowing. - I'd want to know. - You'd want to know? - Yes, certainly. In fact, I believe I have only about three months of life left Should I spend the rest of my life defending a fool who's killed his wife? No, I'm leaving to go to an island. - Here we go again. - You know that's nothing new. Ask your doorman for example, where he would spend what he knew to be his final days. What the fuck is this? He should have a place to go to as well. - Or perhaps not! - How strange... I always expect the truth from someone like you. I have a child on my ward who risks being paralyzed Because of a member of our exalted police force. who killed his father right in front of him. - What should I do? - What exactly happened? Tell them exactly what the risks are? No, I try to operate while hoping all goes well. I do not even want to think about it. It was an accident. The policeman fired at the father, a bullet deflected and hit the kid. I'm defending him. I do not know why, but I figured as much. I will never understand how you defend such awful sorts of people as him. We consider the legal merits of each case. I'm not God, I can't otherwise just condemn anyone. Everyone has the right to be defended on the merits of his case. - Tell that to the boy's mother. - No, I'll tell the court , as is properly required. - You're dealing with the mother aren't you? Good response. Real nice. - Didn't mean to offend. - A lousy conversation. Good night. - Didn't mean to scare you to death! - Bye - Bye What an Idiot. I should take him to see that kid. I'd make him sit by the kid's bed My brother too, in which case I wonder if he might still want to handle the case. Mr. Torre fired because he feared for his life. He was in fear for his very life and therefore, I submit that he should be realeased from custody. so that he may be free from the harshness of prison I ask that he be subject to house arrest instead or other further measures such as having to report regularly to the local police. Thank you. I trust you will render a fair decision in this matter. It never rains but it pours.. He did not accept this invitation because he's been killed. Yes, I've just left the courthouse now. They have to be quick with their descision This guy won't last in prison. He's scared of everything there I've just spoken with him. Okay, see you tomorrow. Alright, Elisa, bye. It's not right, I'm saying it's just not right. Are you pretending you can't hear me? - I don't believe I know you. - I'm Renzi's wife. I want the guy who killed my husband to stay in jail where he belongs! Just wait a moment, Im coming!! You'll eventually have to pay the price of defending him! You do understand! - Come in. - Good morning. - Welcome. - Good morning - Good morning. - Good morning. Lauri... here it is... Basically, not that great Lazy, absent. Why? Did something happen at school? Maybe he just stopped studying. - I do really think thats so. - We shouldn't always make excuses for these kids. If he knew the answers, he would raise his hand when questions are asked . Well... maybe he does not want to upstage the others. It does not seem to me that his problems have anything to do with relationships around here, although, with us teachers, sometimes, he tends to be rather annoying. It's a difficult age, I know. I'll talk to him. You do that. It's mainly a problem with his attitude I believe - It's not as if he is at all full of himself. - No, thats true. - He may be a little shy perhaps even too shy - Anyway, he's got to catch up in his schoolwork. - He will. - Fine. Is there anything else? No, should there be? - See you in a couple of months. - Alright. - See you later. - See you later. On this side we see the goddess Roma, in her bare remains. And on your left, the Saturnia Tellus. which in contrast, is well preserved. That's it for the tour folks. Thank you. I hope you enjoyed it. Goodbye. Is he an admirer? - Lets go to the movies - What's wrong with me this time? - Iranian or Scandinavian perhaps? - French. Oh my, French! The first day off day after 2 weeks I have to compete with that meatloaf? I am a good and generous man. And handsome. Although short. No, I'm just the right size. And its my brother who is abnormally tall. - Have you seen Michael today? - No I had an interview at school. It wasn't a good report, apparently he isn't doing well right now. I see him very distracted and he doesn't seem to communicate well with me. Each time I try to have a talk with him, his cellphone tend to go off and he has to leave... Well, after all he's only sixteen isn't he? There's this party tomorrow and we don't even know the kid who's giving it. - It's probably a friend of Benny's. - Exactly, thats what I'm concerned about. - They are much older, and they tend to be smokers. - They smoke? - Do you want me to talk to him about how it might stunts normal growth? - Or how it lowers your sexual performance? - You're kidding. Then tell him he can't go then If he isn't doing well at school, he's isnt allowed to go to a party. What's that got to do with it? Let him go and have some fun. - Where's Benny? - What? - Where's Benedetta? - She's in a room with some guy Do you want to follow her in there too? - Who the fuck are you? - He's Benny's cousin. - What the fuck are you doing? - You're not at home. - Cousin of Benny, you're a jerk! - Fuck you. What a jerk! - I'm leaving. - It's early yet. - I'm going home. - How are you going, anyway? I'm not sure yet, I suppose I'll either walk or take the metro. - I'm leaving. - Wait, I'll come with you. Sorry. - Hi - Hi Michael! Wait for me! Wait, I'm wearing high heels? What are you doing? Are you crazy? Come on, wait for me! You're drunk, Michael! Michael, are you alright? - Yes, I'm just sleepy. - Are you OK? Are you sure? - Let me go to bed - One o'clock at the latest we said. Alright. - Have you been drinking? - No, I'm fine. - We'll talk about it tomorrow. - Alright, tomorrow. - I think I'll go to London this afternoon. - Alright. - The building next door collapsed during the night. - Really? - Bombarded by aliens. - What are you talking about? Nothing, just checking to see if you're listening. - Sorry, you're right. - What's wrong, you seem bothered by something. Paul bothered me at dinner last night. Are you still thinking about that? Why care about that? We have to live sure of where we stand on moral questions. He has four main ideas and won't budge on his positions on them. - Hello - Hi Good morning. - Do you want a coffee? - No thanks. How did things go last night? - Fine, why? - Just asking - Whose party was it anyways? - Some guy's... - What's with all the questions? - You came back really late. Not that late. - The car? - What? You did not tell me if it's okay. Oh, yes, yes, all right. Of course. 12 thousand euros, and you want to buy another one. What are you doing at lunch? Shall we have get together? No, well, I don't know. Ah! You've already read everything. A voracious reader. I'm going out. Give us a call, if you're going to be late. - She always does as she pleases. - That's OK! - Benny is like that, you know. Isn't that right, love? Leave her alone, she is only just 16 years old. Anyway, I'd like you to know that I got an A in Latin at school. Well done Benny! Really well done! Some day these children will have all have left home, you will be retired... Women won't look twice at you anymore. A beautiful plaque instead of your thigh bone, maybe you'll be bald - and all you'll have left is me - Fine perspective that is! You think so? - Good morning. Hello! - Good morning, Vittorio. Good morning. How's Stefano? He coughed all night, he also has a fever. Sandra, explain to the lady what we do with the apprehensive mothers. - Better not. - Better not. I've always said that moms shouldn't hang around when they're feeling like that. Do not worry, I will not do anything to you. Here, I'll show you a trick. Do you see this handkerchief? It's like mom, now let's make it disappear for a while. You see? It's gone right now You then be able to play soccer in the rain, and have ice cream first thing in the morning, and play video games... Do you feel anything here? - This morning he moved his fingers. - You See? Gradually... Mom's calmed down now. Should we ask her back? Watch this. Let's make Mum re-appear just like this handkerchief. Here we are! - Is he recovering alright? - Give it time. All the time he wants. The coughing, and fever are actually quite normal in these circumstances. Don't worry. Bye Stefano. He says you're better. Oh, how scary! Please! No, please, stay still! Mum! Yes? - Is dinner ready - No, in about 10 minutes. Do not move, please, I beg you! Keep still. What are you doing speaking to the lobster? I can't throw it into the pot, it keeps moving. It's scary tring to do this. - So why did you get it? - I felt like having lobster. But now I can not, seem to get it cooked. - What did you just do? - I thought I'd lend a hand. They don't experience any pain, you know. Hey, you look tired. - Is it due to too much math homework again? Do you want me to talk to him again. No. I don't think he'd like that. Will you bring me a bit of this lobster after you're finished cooking? Good evening to all of you, we start by telling you about an incident which took place in Rome a few nights ago in via Frosinone. On an isolated and poorly lit street in the Salario district. A 48-year-old homeless woman, named Vivienne Le Crou was attacked, kicked and punched by a couple of unknown assailants we believe. The woman is now in a coma as a result. This video footage was recorded by private security cameras installed at a garage located close to the place where the attack occured. The video is being analyzed by the investigating team Please be aware that the images we are about to show you are disturbing to view. and are recommended to be viewed by an adult audience only. Police from Headquarters have asked us to broadcast these images to help investigations gain any additional any possible additional information from the public We asking that you come forward if you did witness this attack Did any of you see anything? Can anyone out there be of help with this investigation? Now let's see together the video filmed by the camera. The video footage isn't too clear however, we are able to make out images of two involved individuals. One appears to be a young girl, who maybe with a boyfriend perhaps. It is believed that from appearences they are likely white youths in this case. What is striking from the video footage is that it shows the two attackers first kicking and repeatedly punching the woman victim, following which they drag her to the sidewalk and leave her there severely wounded. As we said earlier, she is now in a coma as a result. It is clear that the two young people then simply walked away as if nothing had happeneded, taking off on a scooter. As a result of how it is they acted on the whole, we believe it is likely that they are in fact a couple of minors. Go to page 142, today we will talk about the Protestant Reformation. ... girl and then there's a guy moving physically ... young people of white race. What is striking from the video is that the two attackers first take... ... the woman then drag her to the sidewalk and they leave her there seriously injured. I repeat, now in a coma. It is clear that the two young people then took off as if nothing had happened, aboard a scooter. this suggests that the two are minors Michael. Michael. Oh, it's you? I didn't realize you were there. Please sit down. I want to talk to you for a moment. What's up? Has something happened? Is there anything you want to tell me? No, why do you ask? - Are you sure? - Is this about my teacher? Did you talk to him - I already told you the test results were poor. - No, its not about that. What then? Yesterday I viewed a video on television. - What video? - It showed two youths attacking a woman. A surveillance camera captured the footage. And one of them had a white jacket on, similar to yours. And from his profile... well, he looked like it just might have been you Was it you? Was it you and Benedetta? I have to leave you, we'll talk tomorrow, a hug? Bye. - Everything went fine. - Thank you, thank you. - Where's you car? Everything went well, see you in the week. Goodbye, Madam Love, sorry, I could not speak with you earlier because I had something I had to do. Why, did not you go to school? Did something happen? Of course, we can eat something together. But something happened? See you there in 20 minutes you can then tell me everything. Thank you. Do you remember when you enjoyed going fishing? You'd get all the flies ready each evening, you had all those magazines... - Magazines, "Fly fishing magazine"! - You got up at 5:00 each morning! - Sometimes even at 4:00. - Not even miners get up that early. Remember the time I came to see you and some guy asked me to leave? - You were throwing stones. - No, I was making ripples. You were scaring the fish away. I had nothing to do. What was I supposed to do? - Now I'd like... - What? - To go fishing. - If you'd like, I still have all the gear. - How do you see me? - What do you mean? - Do you think I'm a piece of shit? - Sure, I'd say you're a piece of shit. Was this the important thing you wanted to tell me? Did why bring me up here? Could you not just have told me in the car? - May we have the bill please? - Coming! A few days ago, two kids assaulted a homeless woman. They caused her to go into a coma - Well? Do you plan to defend them? - No. A security camera filmed everything. and the video footage was aired on the TV program "Crimewatch" Benny came to see me and talked to me. She says it was two friends of hers. They got drunk at that party. She asked me for advice in order to be of some help to them. What's all this to do with me? In my opinion I don't think thats what actually happended. Meaning? I think it was actually her. Together with Michael. What the fuck are you saying? Michael wouldn't hurt a fly. This is bullshit, Benny is a girl after all. I viewed the video with Sofia last night. I'll admit it wasn't too clear. We both think it was them. Yes, but where are you? Okay, I'll come and join you. I need to talk to her. Could you come out here for a moment? Hi. What's happened? Massimo told me an absurd story about the kids. - Wait for me at home. - Why? I'll finish off and be right there, we can't talk about this here. - He believes that Benedetta lied to him. I think thats impossible. He says he viewed the video over and over again. So I thought "my wife always watches that program too", "and that after seeing that video she'd talk to me about it no doubt". I did see the video. - Why did not you tell me? - Tell you what? Why did not you tell me anything? All you can see a car, a white jacket, and a profile in the shadows. - At first it also seemed to me... - Did you recognize them? - It's hard to be sure. - Is it them? I know my son, do you know him as well? - How can you think he could do something like that? - Could it be them? - Stop asking the same questions over again! It couldn't have been Michael - I want to talk to him. - No, where are you going? - To his school. - I've already talked to him I watched the video that evening, and viewed it again the next morning. I then asked him about it. He denied it was him, and I believed him. Why didn't you tell me anything about this? I did not want to worry you for no reason. - worry me? for no reason? - Don't raise your voice! How can you believe your brother and not your son? Tomorrow Massimo is going to the hospital where that woman is in a coma, to try to more fully come to terms with what's happened to her, perhaps you don't fully realize it yet either He's put this thing in your head. He's put this thing in your head. Now I just want to talk to Michael. Your father wants to talk to you. Come here. Sit down. - Have you spoken with Benny today? - No, she wasn't at school today. - Why, has something happened to her? - Your uncle told me about a video. What video? The video that everyone seems to have seen except me. - That incident? - Yes, that incident! - I already have said I don't know anything about it. - Have you seen it? - Was it the two of you? - No, it wasn't us. - Mom's already given me the third degree. - You have to tell me the truth. What do you want me to tell you? What should I say? - Let me go, I have the test tomorrow. - Are you bullshitting me? - You stop right there! - Stop it, you're hurting him! - Benny has confessed to your uncle that it was the two of you! - That's a lie! Shut up! So, do you now want to tell me the real truth ? - What should he say? - Cut it out! Now, I want to hear it from you as to whether or not it indeed was you! Tell me if you were there! Tell me if you were there! Yes, it was me! It was me! I thought it was a man sitting there in front of Benny's car! She spat at us and then insulted us! I didn't really want to hurt her! I didn't really want to hurt her! Hi. Hi there sweetheart. - Can I speak to you for a moment? - Sure. - Laura, can you take over with this? - Certainly. What's happened? - What is it you wanted? - You really are a fool! - What's happened? - You told your parents everything. My father said to me that you had already confessed. - And you believed it? - Yes I did. I wanted to understand what penalties we might eventually face. I only told my own father some story to get his view. - How was I supposed to know that? - You're really a jerk. Now because of you we are in shit, do you understand? - Cut it out! - I do not understand why I still hang out with you! Go fuck yourself, then. The fact that the woman is dead and that that crimeshow on TV keeps covering the case really complicates matters In the video we see the car, but we can't read the license plate. There are thousands of these cars out there. The video image is not clear when Michael is kicking her we only see him from behind, Benedetta is constantly moving around. I knew he shouldn't have gone. Benedetta told me she looked around and saw that there was nobody else there. She took him to that party! - Your attitude is pointless and annoying. - Quit it. Quit what? What's with this stuff? Why are you here? Because she is my wife and she raised Benedetta. - Ah! - Don't worry. It 'doesn't matter. No witness calls came from the broadcast. So what are we talking about? I do not understand. - A muder investigation is now underway in this case. - Why murder? They hadnt intended to kill her, they just wanted to move her away. - The fact remains they would have been aware they were inflicting obvious harm. - That's what you think! It's what the prosecutor would think and accuse them of involuntary manslaughter in any event Which would mean between 6 to 12 years in prison considering they are minors. - It's absurd. - Anyway, there are some extenuating circumstances. They are from good families free of any previous criminal record I doubt they'd even see a prison sentence in this case. I'm thinking of a hypothesis for the defense... I have to go, I'm on duty. I have to operate. - I suggest we finish this discussion first. - I'm sorry, I can't stay. You've told us what you think, what you want to do. I will have to reflect on it. - What is there to think about? - I'm confused. overwhelmed, alright? I think it's only normal. I told you I'll think about it. Now, excuse us, lets go Clara I am speechless. I just don't understand them. A couple of idiots, that's what they are. He is not like that. - He is impressionable when he's around her - Bullshit. Such behavior... from a girl, even... I want you to talk to Massimo. About what? About his daughter who is out of her mind. She might just go around telling everyone what they did simply to brag. Don't you know what she's like? As for my son! I no longer know just what stuff it is that he is made of Someone who kicks a woman in the street. What difference does it make if she asked him to do it? - He was drunk, he wasn't fully cognizant of his actions - You think thats a valid excuse for what he did? Everytime someone gets drunk, it means they then kill someone? I do not know what to do, how to behave. You do realize that their lives are ruined? It's all over for them. - Do not say that. - It's the truth. Even if they're never found out... - How do you live knowing that your child has killed someone? - Please. - And how can he live with it? - Its all over - I'm worried. - You know how much I love Benny as if she were my own daughter. You can ask me anything, you do not have to be afraid, understand? I'll say I went to pick her up at the party. That I then I brought her home and we went to bed. I could say that, so you do not have to worry. It's okay with me, if I have to say so. It's not a problem. It is essential that you remember the times that he needs to take his medicines. - What if I see him experience some kind of reaction from taking them? - There won't be any reactions. In case of an emergency, take him to the nearest hospital. - What sort of emergency could there be? - These are routine instructions. I'm discharging him, because I believe that he is well enough for that now. Nothing will happen to him. Do what the doctor says and everything will be fine. You'll probably be an even better nurse to your son than me. - Better than you; thats impossible. - Doctor, did you hear that? Here it is, it's all signed. Goodbye Madam. Thanks for everything. - Thank you very much. - Goodbye. Say hi to Stefano. - Do not let me find the records in such condition again in the future. - What do you mean? All piled up, it's a mess over there. I'm sorry, I'm on duty since yesterday and I thought... - Don't think about it, just do it. Right away! No not now, later. There... thanks. - What's wrong? - Nothing, I'm not feeling too well. Anyway, everything's okay. I'll speak with my father tonight and let you know. - Catch you tonight? - Ok. - Bye. - Bye. - How're you feeling? - Not too well. - What did Benedetta want? - Nothing, everything's okay. Will you sign this thing, or will you still keep us waiting? I'm going. - I brought you a tea. - I've already said I do not want it. How do you feel? Do you want us to talk a bit? - Again? - Sooner or later we should. I've already told you that I do not feel like talking about this stuff anymore. Everything will be resolved, you'll see. I hope so. Okay. Well I'll I leave it here anyway. Drink it hot. Sorry. I came by to find Michael is still in bed. Why isn't he up? - He was sick today, I went to pick him up - Really? Yes, he vomited twice. You could bring him here to Pediatrics, for a check-up. I'm tired of these wisecracks. He was ill. and I went to pick him up. Thats the normal thing to do, I believe. - You on the other and dont seem normal to me right now. - No? No. Paul, no. It is not normal that you attacked Michael in such a manner the other day. It is not normal for you to be quiet in your study. It's not normal for you not to have answered your brother's phone calls for days. Let me understand, are you worried about him feeling offended? Why do you always have shit responses? I don't give a damn. But at least they're trying to make progress, they're trying to find solutions. Even that stupid Sofia is doing more than you. - Is that what you think of me? - No, but thats what I see at the moment. I can't sleep anymore and I've got children to operate on. I'm mistreating colleagues whom I've worked with for years, because I can't stop thinking about what happened. Do you think about it? You think about it, think about it, think about it. - Yes, I think about it all the time. - But what do you do about it? What use is your thinking about it? What use are your fucking thoughts to us, if you do not express them to us? Please, say something. No, really, come on. Silence again? You really do have a strong presence however. Incisive. Thank goodness we've got you. Anyway, I spoke with Massimo, we're all getting together for dinner tomorrow. You know very well what you should do! I know what we should do! What do you want from me? What do you want from me! I don't understand. Even the other day at the studio, he just took off. I can't understand why, does he seem normal to youl? I do not know, maybe he needed to talk to Clara alone. He should talk to me too, I'm his brother. I'll have to talk to Benny, and tell her what you're planning to do. Of course, but I really know if I'm doing the right thing. I don't know. I've made so many mistakes with her. No you haven't. - See you later. - Bye - Good morning, Counsel. - Good morning. Your daughter's waiting for you. She got here a short while ago. Do me a favor, cancel my afternoon appointments. Right away. - Hi Dad. - Hello sweetheart. - How are you? - Fine. - Can I talk to you for a couple of minutes? - Yes sure. Take all the time you need. Sit down. - I would have called you. - Oh? - Because I'm a little worried. - Yes I know. It's a shitty situation and I'm truly sorry. But on the other hand, you understand that it wasn't altogether our fault. - I saw the video. - Exactly As you saw, we just wanted to move her, but Michael got out of control He can't handle alcohol. The problem now is my Uncle, his father. Meaning? Michael is afraid, he says his father's out of his mind - keeps freaking out We thought you could talk to him. Don't know what's going through his head his head, he might even be thinking of reporting us. What should I say to him? Explain everything to him, he's crazy if he gets us in trouble over this affair Over an old tramp who started the whole thing by attacking us. It's absurd. Yes, of course, it is absurd. Perhaps he does not fully realize what's at stake. - No, maybe not. - Perhaps you could, explain to him how things are. Talk to him about prison, scare him... Okay, I'll talk to him as soon as I see him.. It's settled, then? Settled, yes.. It's all I came here for. Oh, and the car is fine now. I'm glad. - Bye Dad. - Bye, Benny. Good afternoon, sir. - Hi - Hi How did it go? - What did he say to you? - More or less what we already knew. - We're late, do you want me to let Paul know? - No. - Do you need to change? - No. - Maria? - She's in there with te kids I'll wait for you there. Can you look for the electronic "Baby-monitor", please? Can't seem to find it I put it somewhere, don't remember where. I was afraid. I told you that everything was fixed. You're being so paranoid. I panicked when she died. I got really sick the other day. If I tell you evrything's all right you do believe it don't you? It wouldn't be the first time that my father has gotten me out of a jam.. - Did you watch the video again? - Of course! It's really frightening, eh? all this fuss and you can't even tell its me. - Nor that its me - Oh yes, you've been found out - What do you mean? - You have! - Imagine if we had set her on fire! - We nearly did. I did not understand what I was doing, I was completely out of my mind. Really! Guys, we're going. Maria will soon have to go to bed. Call Laura who can put her to bed. Bye cutie! - Bye. And you two try not to be up too late. - All right. The station continues to air the video, All they need is some or other detail to cause a witness to come forward Benedetta said there was no one else there. So... Today I spoke with a dear friend of mine, a Public Prosecutor. - Why did not you warn us? - Let him finish. He confirmed that they could be accused - of involuntary manslaughter. - You've already told us that previously. But nothing has happened yet. Because of him. - What do you mean? - Nothing forget it. I do not leave it alone. I want to know what you're thinking. You've havent wanted to speak to me for days now. - I already know what you want from me. - Oh yeah, what? What? You're happy. I'm happy? Why would I be happy? You like to take your little revenges. - What you are you talking about? - Let him speak, I'm curious. - What revenges? - You can always say that you're right, in the end That you know how life works. There was no need to hedge anymore, just what do you want to do? What advice exactly did your Prosecutor friend give you? To get someone in high places to help cover everything up? Have you already made a few phone calls? Or do you have some desperate person who will perjure themselves if offered a few pennies? Everything is fine, it should be obvious that I want to save my son.. The kids believed that you might possibly report them, and we thought they might be right. - Yes, that's what we all thought. - Report them? - What are you saying? - And that's what I came to hear! I wanted to tell you that I agree. I consulted an excellent lawyer... because I would not be able to deal with a trial like this personally. What are you talking about? What trial? Nothing's happened yet. He wants to report them. Isn't that so? - Is that so! - Do not raise your voice here. - Yes, I think it's the right thing to do. - Speak for yourself! - I am speaking for myself. - Michael is just 16 years old! 16! You are crazy. Inside a prison cell with hardened criminal types? They will not end up in jail, they are minors, free of a criminal record. They will consider all the extenuating circumstances, and I will do everything I can to help them. - Can you guarantee that? - How can you give such guarantees? You're playing with my son's life! Your daughter dragged my son into this situation. - Oh, come on! - Stay out of this I said! I said be quiet! An old tramp provoked them, and they reacted! Your daughter and that idiot Michael behind her. I heard them talking about it tonight, they do not realize what they've done, it's as if it never happened. I heard them. You do not understand. - They are afraid. - What kind of fear? What fear ? They think I'm a piece of shit that will do anything to get them out of this. But no. I will not do it. - You're crazy I am not about to report my own son. - I will have to then. - You can not do this. - Are you going to stop me? Yes, you can not decide for both of us. - I can for my daughter. - But you'll drag him into it too. - I do what the hell I think! - You do not fuck! - Jerk! - I do what the hell I think right. - You do it and I'll kill you. - Can't you see you're now being a clown? I assure you that tomorrow morning Benny's turning herself in. I really will kill you. - Oh God, I forgot my purse. - I wait for you. - Here you go. - Thank you. See you later. 1080p english subtitles: (moviesbyrizzo)
