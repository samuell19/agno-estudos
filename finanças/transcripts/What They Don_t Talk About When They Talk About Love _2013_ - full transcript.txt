A seagull flies high up in the sky. Calling his cry toward the sun. Carrying my fantasies down touching the foam. Then gone is he above the sea. All of a sudden I was simply shaken up. My eyes were shattered flat. A tiny boat was swinging up and down. For some old fishing fad. For three days long the moon didn't show up. The sky was empty although without clouds. All of a sudden I understood the song that seagull sang. It was minor blue melody. A lonely wounded heart's pang. He had no friend to share his misery. And certainly not to split the saddest part. Who is it? Andhika. Sorry. Hello. Mother? Diana is in class. Today? Diana has promised Fitri already. I'm sorry, yes, Diana understands. Alright, alright. OK, Diana will wait for your call. Good day. I'm sorry. Ma'am! Yes! Thank you, Ma'am. Good day. Good day to you. Your perfume, is it Fantasy? How do you know? A friend wore that. You want? What is it? It's good. Yes, good. Seventy three.

And don't step on the rug! Fine, I'll just float then. Or go home. No. What do you want? Why don't you call first? I threw my phone away. Because everytime I held it I'd always wanted to see your pictures. I can't take it. I love you too much. I can't take that we've broken up. That's the problem, Joe. I am a simple person. You are full of dramas. This is because I love you too much. Anything that I see... It makes me think of you. Seeing a dress at a store... I wanna buy it for you. Even when I see pebbles on a road.. I wanna carved it into a ring for you. I'm sorry, Joe. I can't. I'll change. I promise I'll be a drama king no more. You are being a drama king now. Do you love me? Joe... Do you love me? Yes. Then... Please give me a chance. That's not the problem. Tell me what the problem is. Who's that? I'm her husband. Y-you said you were divorced. Yes, that's right, Joe. But.. We just decided to get back together. I'm sorry, Joe. I understand. Boring. It's always about love. How will Joe's love story end? Wait on how Joe's story continues next week! And don't forget... Don't miss a horror story about Fynta... Who has the ability to see ghosts. Tonight at eleven. Beware, it's a very scary story... Mario's mobile twenty-nine-o-sixty-seven.

I'll ask to the Ghost Doctor then. Ghosts can't grant wishes. They can! They can, right? Depends. Some can, some cannot. Too long! Some can, some cannot. Some can, some cannot. So when will you go with me? Anytime. Di... I'll leave you just for a while, OK? Yes, it's fine. Ma'am, how much? Who is it? Who is it! Your. Boyfriend. Has. A mole. Fitri! At the rearview mirror!

You said that... ...before this you'd never believed in love at first sight. It wasn't logical. And then you said... ...you defied all logic. Hearing it made my heart raced. Flirt! But I can't forget that day. In the middle of our way, you asked me... ...whether I had feelings for you. I said that I did. Then you pulled over straight away... ...unfastened your seatbelt... ...and kissed me. Our first kiss. Remember? Then you took my virginity. I told you it was a sin! We had to marry first. As if it was for sure I would marry you one day. But then you said... ...what is the beauty of a hymen... ...if can only be enjoyed by one man? But of course, after that the hymen is gone!
