That guy James I'm like brother. Okay. I think I'm just missing Jasmine. I've never met a girl before. She's the first catheter. Since high school, you gotta be kidding me. The next you're going to be telling me that you were hurt. Big. You ain't happy since it had you. No, you fool. I'm not a vegan. That's just been a long time. Five years. Oh yeah man. He'll version in my book. When was the last time you had to go. Last week? Remember to cross out a chick? Yeah. She came over to the crib. We started rapping. And that's how it happened for you. Have you tried with Jasmine? I mean, do you even still know how to do it? Because you know you, you still that'd be. I will have you walking here every weekend until you're 35. Keep talking. Hey man, I'm just playing. God. No, I haven't tried anything with Jasmine yet. I'm waiting on your rights. Well check your watch every time. It's the right time. Summer, spring, fall five o'clock in the morning Groundhog day Lee. The first day she came to my house would have been the right time. See you don't rush things like that. When you want to build something real. Wild animals can just have sex. And I would have had monkey sex with Hutchins. I don't even think about sex when I'm with Jasmine scammy, not doll. I'm telling you this girl is something special when I'm retired. It's like, I don't think about anybody else. It's like the only two people in the world. I knew nothing else. My Tufts don't care that I am broke. Well, you better start caring. Cause she blowing up. Dude. She not going to be ran on a bus. I mean think about it. She want to ride in a hot ride on sitting on them. Things. She around all them superstars and celebrities. And you know, the big time is going to be hitting that ain't be got her heels. You don't think she wanted them girls to try to use what she got to gives you one, because if you do, I mean, you might as well have sex with her now, before it's too late and you know what? I can hide in the closet and record the whole thing. And I mean, you can have a sex tape late. He was left with a box and get your son. He is scared to walk. Now you food. I'm just saying I could hide to walk now and worked for Kim K boy. Sir. She has recovered from surfing needs to rest. You're going to have to leave because you've got 10 minutes and that's it. Baby. Promised what happened. It was Kesha. She was following me. Can't. Shut up talking crazy. I left. I went to the car to puck a little kid. She came out of nowhere. She's staffed. Wait in front of Boston upset. She is not worth you. Going back to jail over to say the police investigated, going to investigate. Wait, I need to tell him, please cut. Please protect him. Doesn't know what he's doing up. Well, now that we're going to be working together. I just want to make sure we're on the same page. Okay? So now that you're about to be famous. Oh, you ain't gonna have no boyfriend. Right? Why do you say that? Where do I begin? I'm going to be doing show network events. I mean on the road and the studio doesn't have a lot on your plate and I know Sean, he's not going to be ready for all of. Is that. Look, all I'm saying is now that you're about to take over. You might want to consider the other options. I hate to break it to you, but the sun is just not your tight. He works a mall job. I mean he barely makes 25 K a year for Christ's sake. He still lives in his grandmother's house. His car alone is an embarrassment all in itself. You don't want to be seen with a guy like that. Not for the level that you're about to be on. It's just not a good look for you. And. So what type of guy do you think I should be with a boss? Someone that can take care of you financially as well as section is that Sean wouldn't know what to do with all that. I didn't, even if I told him myself, oh really? What you need is a real man's man. Somebody like me, it's just not natural for a boy. Like the shine to be with a woman like you. Okay, I get it. So because you have money and status, then I should want to be with somebody like you. And because Dishon is just an average guy, then it's not right for me to want to be with him. I don't make the rules, but I just play the game. He just got it all figured out. Don't you it's my job. You were about to be the next biggest thing coming out of the shot. So I think it's time we turn it up at night. So tonight it's all about you and me. But do you have plans? We'll do a little shopping. Go to the spa hair, done nails done. You know, I like the sound of it. And after that, who knows what two consenting adults may get into. Tell me, you love me. Love me. I want to hear Craig. You know how I feel about you? You're still messing with that. Goofy. Want to know this? This right here. This mind you, my baby. I said Jess, because I let you hit does not mean I'm your baby or your girl. She a lie. You will be. Kenneth is mommy. And he's coming back to me now until then all you is a good way. Just enjoy the ride. Why you paying? Okay. Look, if I catch buddy over here, I'm stretching them out.

What's she got your nose wide open first and foremost. Think about it. Who doesn't know who peanut head James is? Everybody knows who he is. She act like she didn't so she could get it to man. She can still find her way inside with him. Don't you get it? She got, you want him off a square and you over here struggling over some basic chick who.

Maybe that especially that's the next thing on the album, James, what are you doing? You got a few minutes. This time you start showing me something. A little taste of what stuffed lamb we need to go. I don't like to play games and you want to both know what you want. Everything is not always about you. It is. It is about me. You know why? Because I'm the one out here making deals and it's time that you get down on your knees and baby, just like the rest of. Your right to shine. Couldn't possibly handle a woman like me anyway. I need a real man above plus it's about time. I start treating myself. Now. See, now you're starting to talk. Don't you ever do that to me again, father is going to get you. Juice in the kitchen, my kitchen. Oh, he'll know what he's saying. Hey, cheap, fast, stupid. Thank God. There's something we need to talk about. It Was wrong. Everything was going to be. Okay.

You always do. He's your only cousin. Did you all he got well, I do you really think just the customer you'll grow, shows up that he's not going to need you anymore. When we get out of here, I want to split things for you. Let's go down to city hall and get married. See that ain't gonna make anything better. Maybe. Maybe not, but it's definitely a step in the right direction.

Look, I know what's going to be some ladies there and I'm trying to do some parking lot. Walk up. Definitely not this one.

Find us, keep us loses. We don't want to mess around the Contra mono. I already got my shot for that dog. Don't even worry about it. Obama cap. You know why he's not going to be able to make it. He was feeling a little sick. So he went on back to the hotel. But what he did ask her to do was to last year and the event. So she does well, you got yourself a. Deal. Okay, well, let's get this thing started. Oh, I need some chocolate to help me calm a combat. Hey aren't you dishonest cousin. Yeah. And. So what, so is he with you? Nope. I need to talk to him and RJ play him like that. Excuse me. When you. Think, I don't know what you tried to get through D just to get to James. Yeah. I saw you get out of his car the other night. All them bags and. All the phone numbers. First of all, you need to come correct with how he's talking to me. Secondly, it's not even like that. Minnis females, just like you. The only one to mess with dudes for one thing, money, everybody know you ain't want to mess with di like that in the first place. You don't know anything about me. I love to Shawn. He's a great man and he's very good to me. And I'm a good and faithful woman to him. So if you think that I'm out to hurt your cousin, that shame on you because I'm not going to mess up what we have for nothing. Not even my career. Now, James that's the snaky needs to be looking out for Pick up your food. Hey, Hey dude, dude. Man, I want to apologize to you for what I said the other day, man. Song, ride or snap, man. I was wrong. Deshawn. When grandma died, you was the one I was looking after me. And I guess when Jasmine came into the pitcher, I started to miss man. But look, it's your life. I'm happy for you. And I respect that. Most importantly, man, I let you. Jump in. Listening to James. Is about to perform. Hey man, it's called you, but that's Vanessa beat. So it can not now stop. Tell us, tell him right now. I will tell him how you been sneaking this girl behind his back. What are you on drugs? Come on the shine. You know, I would never do you like that, man? We like family. Man. His family. And I'm proud of you playing them like that. Yeah. You want me to, sorry. I'll put your hands on me. I'm calling my lawyer. It's what are you doing? I told you to turn was almost up. Hey, y'all saw that right? I ain't see nothing. Hold on, hold on James. You don't have to do that. You leave. Man. I ain't going nowhere, man. Don't want you to tell Dee, tell him that you threatened to ruin his girl career. If he said that you pushed up on in the studio earlier, what are you talking about? Candidates. Come on to shine. You know, he's been jealous of our relationship since high school. Sure. It's true. James is not your friends earlier. James tried to proposition me for sex in exchange for a music deal. He's not your friend. Come on. You going to really listen to some groupie chick you just met. You're gonna let her feed you with a bunch of lies. She's the one that tried to push up on me, Sean. I know that you think that James is your friend, but trust me, he is not. He only hangs out with you because he's insecure about his own shortcomings. So he keeps you around because you make less money than him. And it makes them feel good to be literally you, but trust me, baby, you are so much better than him and you don't need him at all. Hmm. See, that's where you're wrong. He does need me. When I'm around, the Shaun gets a little bit good lights. He drives the fanciest cars we eat at the most upscale restaurants. Hell he needs people that he'd only read about in. Magazines. I give them a taste of what it feels like to be a stop. And to Sean knows there's nothing wrong with living in another man shadow. Especially if his mom. Deshaun doesn't need to live in anybody's shadow. She casts his own. No. What? You're skating on thin ice girls can't believe you do this to me. I thought we were brothers, man. Did you know me, man? I know you not. Believe in this mess. You know me, Joe, right? I do know you. I chose. To look in the other direction because I realized something. I realized that I did like living in your shadow because I looked up to you. But now I know can only look down at his snake. Come off. You don't come off. That was a good line. Hey, I'm gonna use that. Let's go, Kenneth, Jasmine. I know you have to perform. So I'll come to your house tonight. No. If my man is leaving, then I'm leaving too. I don't care anything about this record deal. Especially if it means working under him. I think I like her. So we out. Hey, you're nothing without me. You and Mitch. And that convict cousin of yours y'all can get the hell out of there. My hostel wants told me that haters are going to hate. Elevate and motivate you, but I'm going to do you a solid and ladies, hands on you. The one I told you, what. Would happen if I caught you cheating on me again? I hope the sex was worth 2.7 didn't meal, young. I'm sorry. I'm messing up your big chance. You did it earlier. Maybe one of the executives backstage. And I told them what was going on with James. He set up a personal meeting with me and Clive Davis tomorrow. God is good. Look, I haven't been totally honest about things in my life. I know you don't know. I must stupidest shine and you still want to be, of course it was never about what you had. I liked you since the first day I met you. Wait a minute. Pardon me? You still treat boom.
