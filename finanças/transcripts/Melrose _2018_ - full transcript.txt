Um, let me text one of my clients back. Just a second. Okay. Clarke. Clarke. I wanna be honest with you and just cut through the bullshit, but I am dropping you as a client, and you might not believe this, but... One day at a time. One day... One day... One day... Just take it one day at a time. One day... One... Fuck! Are you... Can I have, like, five more minutes? Hey, Mom. Hey, Mom. Hey, Mom. Hey, Mom. What I like about myself? Trying to get as close as soon as possible. Broski! We're the broskies? End of message. Hey, Mom. No. No one's called me back yet. I promise I will let you know. - I'm very calm. - It's about zombies, but worse. They're everywhere. These... These werewolves. I am a very level-headed person. , but the mob gets involved. Come on, man, Don't touch my strawberry lemonade. , I swear. Hey, Mom, I was wondering give me loads or more money on my card. I haven't got my picture. Why wouldn't they? I earned it. I'm a great listener, I'm very social. I throw myself at everything I do. It's quite thoughtful. I didn't even know what love was until I met you, September. You'll recruit me at some point. In regard to the interview that I had the other day... A few days ago. Last week. Last month. No, yeah, I have been going in the suit. Neither of us is getting anything from this relationship. I don't know how to help you anymore. You of all people know what rejection feels like. It's... It's just... It's... It's time. Right now? It happened, and you're gonna get over that. In this moment... And you didn't at the time? What do you mean I'm not trying hard enough? Over and over and over. I'm not trying to tell you that you're wrong. I'm sorry for arguing. I'm not trying to argue. I like to think I don't really need anyone else. She'd do everything, okay? I'm not afraid to ask anyone for help. Please. Please. - I let you be really honest. - You just stop. If you were my age? Mom, Mom, Mom. If you were my age, gas was 50 cents a barrel, it was 25 cents a gallon. I could become a bigger person. It's not 1873 anymore. And hope that everything works out. I came out here to do what? I know that that's like everything for you. Our relationship isn't being healthy for us - at this point. - Yeah. You might not believe this, but it's incredibly painful for me. - Can I help you? - No, I did this to myself. This is all my fault. I'm trying everything here. Well, what do you want, Mom? Do you just... Do you wanna get that? All right. I just... And step back before you say something you'll regret. Fuck you! Are you kidding? - I love it out here. This... - Are you okay? You know, it's sunny, lots of people that go... - Hey. - Hiking, kind of like... - Take care of yourself. - It's kind of hiking, right? Sort of hiking? You got to take care of yourself, please. I'm sorry I called. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I miss you. Do not do anything stupid. Can we skip this question? So when will I be hearing from you? Oh, shit! I am so sorry. - It's fine. - No, no, no, no. I totally just destroyed your suit. - It's okay. - Okay. Just let me... At least give me... Let me get you another cup or something, please. Okay. Okay, uh... Uh... Fuck, man. Fuck. I'm gonna sound like a total douchebag right now because I just promised you another cup of coffee, but I am 100% broke right now. Please, at least... at least let me do something else. Let me get you one. Dude, it's fine. No, it's not. I made you... Trust me, if I didn't wanna be here, you would've known by now. Besides, I can't really go anywhere like this, can I? - Are you a Mormon? - Job interview. - Oh, for what? - Just a solution. Oh! No, no, no. It's nothing personal. I just don't do offices. - You don't do offices? - No, man. I do my own thing. What's that? Consolidated management, mostly, but I actually prefer producing. - You're a producer? - Yeah. - You an actor? - Yeah. Delicious! How's that going for you? I fucking hate it out here. I have to force myself to be excited about everything. Well, that's life, homeboy. You're an actor. But how long have you been out here, anyway? Where are you from? Bakersfield. - Bakersfield? - Yeah. - And you hate it here? - Mm-Hm. You can't hate LA. Look at this. We have beautiful weather. We have the beach. We have pollution. We have drug addicts on the street. We have bad traffic, high cost of it. Finally. I was ready to pull off the violin. Where do your parents live? They're up in Bakersfield, my mom and my stepdad. And what do they think about all of this? I don't really wanna... Okay. Cool. That's fine. We don't need to talk about it. It's... See, I just... Sometimes I wish they were all just a bunch of assholes. 'Cause it's ten times easier to write off a bunch of assholes, but the thing is they are not a bunch of assholes. All they do is just try to help me. Yeah, I hate assholes. I'm the asshole on this situation. No, no, no, no. And I mean, honestly, how long have you even been out here for? - Too long, man. - What? Getting a star on the Walk of Fame, becoming famous, developing a coke addiction, marrying a celebrity, not marrying a celebrity... I just wanna get my foot in the door. Oh, please. Come on. Look at all these people around us. All of them are in their 40s and 50s. I bet they're still living with Mommy and Daddy, trying to get their foot in the door, and what are you? Sixteen? Twenty? Twenty years old. Oh, please, you're fine. I mean, look at you. You're young, you're tallish, you're thin. I'm sure people like you, generally. I mean, so with all of that, what's next? Honestly, probably just getting the fuck out of here. I'm just wasting your fucking time. I'm sorry. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Where are you going? What is this? What is this? - Sorry, I... - No, no, don't apologize. - Did I offend you? - No. Then don't apologize. I like being offensive, but that's not what I was trying to do. Have a seat. Come on. By all means. What's go... What's going on? I don't wanna go home. Then don't. Who cares? This is LA. Do whatever you want. It's fine. I got to go tell my mom about that. Hey, hey, come here, come here, come here, come here. Here. It's a grounds-up operation. The pay is definitely not great. However, you work your own hours. It's employee-owned. Call this number, and we'll set up a time on Tuesday afternoon, okay? We're over in Hollywood. All right. I probably should get going myself. Thanks, kid. Feel good about you today. One day at a time. Can we send somebody else? Well, what about this new guy? Hey, Barry. Oh, hey. Good seeing you, buddy. This is Justine. Justine, Clarke. Clarke, Justine. She's gonna be taking you through orientation today. - A pleasure to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Justine is my muse. - Oh, stop. He says that about everybody. Inspiration is everywhere. - So... So do you guys like... - I can't really hear you. I'm gonna go now. You got this? - Oh, absolutely. - Great! You, uh... Yeah. Okay. Later, homeboy. What? Oh! Excuse me. Sweetheart. He does that. You good? - Yeah. - Follow me. - So where are we going? - Oh, not too far. How you holding up back there? Is this it? Is this it? - We made it. - Oh, oh, yeah. - Fuck off. - Magic, Mike. - Fuck off, Justine. - Say hi to Michael. - Hi, Michael. - Fuck off. Be quiet! Thank you. Give me your headshot. You want my headshot? Yes! - Two hundred, flat, no more. - I just... You'll never be as good at fucking me as I am at fucking you. So just do what you always do, which is what I tell you. Okay, Wallace? No. No. Back's nice and roomy. No. Hey. Again? Again with the hair? Fuck you! You motherfucking piece of shit! Fuck you! Do you know what's going on? Do you know what's going on? Hey! Nice haircut. - Are you ready? - What? To have fun. Eeny, meeny, miny... Fuck it. Are you coming? Come on, dipshit. Hi. We're from AT&T. We're servicing your block today, and we're here to renew your plan. So your phone lines are actually out of date. The way that the landlines work is that they're basically gonna start degrading over time. It is a little bit more of a hassle usually, but we do offer a bundle that's internet and phone so it kind of smooths out the transition. It's sort of the copper wire and all that. My boss isn't here right now. You know what? That's okay. You can just sign for your employer. All right. You... That girl from the... You know, why don't we just come back when she is here. What time is she in? - Uh, 10:00 a.m. - Okay. Did you guys need... We're just waiting for our manager. - They're just a few blocks over. - What the fuck? - Okay. - Just wait. - That was easy. What the fuck... - Shh. So you guys are just here to renew the plan thing? Yeah. - Leaving already? - Yes, I am. - Where are you going? - I'm going back to my car. That's 15 miles. Do you want a ride? - No, I'm good. - Nice not knowing you. Fuck it. Where do you wanna be for the rest of your life? Hey, buddy, it's me. Wait, where are you... Hey, are you running... Is he... Are you running away from me? Look at you. Come on, big bird. Look at those legs. Hey, bud, come on. I'm sorry, man. I'm really, really sorry. But seriously, do you work out? Hey, where the fuck are you... Hey, listen, I said I was sorry. - Fuck you! - Just get in the car. Come on, man. I'm totally sorry. Oh, shit. You okay, bud? Dude, I... Hey, bud. Okay, no more bullshit. Just get in the car. I'm... Pinky swear? So that's what happened. Now, you had no idea. Turned out her real name was actually... Where the hell are we? Anyway, keep the lights off because of the electric bill, but the pool is back here. I'm gonna go grab us some drinks and... - Baby doll. - Hi. Back already? Forget something? Yeah, I forgot my hair tie. Right. - Okay. So anyway... - What? Come on, listen, we're all adults here. It's fine. They're right there on the statue. Those aren't mine. Clarke, you seem like a whiskey kind of guy. - Come on. - I don't drink. Hey, listen, I'll be your Marco, you can be my Polo. Marco. Marco. Come on. What are... Are you allergic to fun? - I... I get what you... - What are you doing? Where's my limeade? Where's my limeade? I get what you guys are trying to do. And I really appreciate it, like, seriously, thank you. This is a great opportunity, but I just... I'm not cut out for this. How come? Well... You said you were a producer. - I am a producer. - You are? Yeah. I'm not lying to you. I do a lot of different jobs. - My title is not that important. - Uh-huh. Yeah, listen, you said you wanted an open job, you wanted an open schedule to go on auditions. This is what it is. Oh, come to Daddy, come to Daddy. Yeah, pick up the top, pick up the top, pick up the top. - I do, yeah. - Not... I don't want any trouble with you guys. Trouble? What trouble? Well, isn't this illegal? - No, it's not. - Not really. I mean, nothing worse than telemarketing, - and we do that, too. - Okay. Listen, Clarke, when I was your age... Twenty, right? I was a guitar player in a ska band, and I had my share of crap jobs, but you know which one was the worst? - The worst? - What? - Guitar center. - But why? Because every single day I came home and I was sick of music, sick of music. You know why? Because every single second of the day, every minute and every hour that I was at work, I was talking about guitar strings, fretboards, music, albums, drums, piano, etc., etc., so the last thing I wanted to do after a long day of work is to come home and pick up my guitar, and I tried to make it work. I did, but looking back, if I had an opportunity like you do now to take this job, I would have done it in a heartbeat. You know why? Because it's not connected to my passion. It's just a cash job. You can have an open schedule. You can work on your craft. I wrote the best songs of my life when I was working at Payless Shoes. Listen, it's very easy to do. And look at you. I mean, you could be a different character every single day of the week. Just think of the fountain of inspiration that you'll have. Listen, okay, fine, do me a favor. Take a couple of days. Think about it, and after a couple of days, if you don't want it, fine. That's great. We part friends, and I'll write you the best recommendation letter you've ever had. However, I'm just thinking that this job could be one of those jobs that you end up talking about on the James Lipton show. You mean Inside the Actors Studio? - By James Lipton. - Is it Inside The... Yeah. - This... - Yeah. - The acting one. - Right. - What was... - Inside... - the Actors Studio. - The Actors Studio. - That's what I said, same thing. - Okay. - James Lipton show. - Right. What's your favorite swearword. Hey, yeah, it's me again. Don't know if you've been getting any of my messages, but I kind of really need to talk to you, okay? So, yeah, just give me a call. It's urgent. - Clarke, dude, what's up? - Hey, man. What are you up to, man? It's been like actually forever. Where have you been? - No way. - Thank you. Who can you get dreaming of? - I don't know. - Whose story is faulty? I am the best. People literally moved out of their homes. Okay, I see what you told me. Even they didn't move out about, they just died. They just died. There was no home. I don't know. They had to sing this. I had a shut down. Auschwitz had nothing. Oh, my God. - Come on, okay. - This has been. What was the line in The Exorcist when she was like a sucking tick? What was it? I'm going guys. I got to go. No, she says, when she says, "Fuck you." - Hey, Mom. - Hey, honey. I just got to work late. But... Is it not the time? No, no. I'm free. Sorry. How... How are you? Um, you know what? Let me... I think just... While we are on the phone, Rick and I talked to your counselor yesterday, and there's a possibility that you could come back to school in the fall. What? Clarke, you still there? Just wanted to let you know there's a possibility. You can totally think about it later. I have some good news, Mom. That's great. What does that mean, Clarke? I won't need to be coming home. I got a job. Yeah? Okay. I'm okay, I'm okay. Kaylah, I'm telling you, this relationship isn't going to work out, okay? Pretty soon... Your phone lines aren't going to work anymore. Everyone's going fiber-optics. Do you want my glasses on or off? Thanks for having me. You know, I wasn't bad back there. I've got a knack for this. You know what? That's really fantastic to hear. Look, Stacy, look, I love... Stacy, there's nothing cliché about love. Look... It's all right. Okay. So quick question. Would my character really be self-confident for being alone at this point? 'Cause I don't know about you, but... Okay, I'm just gonna throw this out. What if he was abused as a child? And like, him buying the Sprite for this girl is like an expression for, you know, wanting to experience something real 'cause, obviously, I would... I don't know about you, but I... I think a lot about his influence, about his new sexuality. And I... I just feel like we should really explore that one, you know? 'Cause I mean, let's face it, he's obviously never had any sense of true intimacy, right? Okay, okay. Yeah, I got it. Okay. Hey, guys. Wait a second. This isn't the tennis court. Shh. Exactly. What did I miss? Lifetime? - Sparkle TV. - Sparkle TV. I fucking love Sparkle TV. I mean, I guess it shouldn't bother me. I know that Sparkle shit whatever, will have no life, but so... You need the money. No, no. Not even that. It's getting rejected by the people you hate most. Can't even stoop to their level anymore. Anymore? Oh, you're... No, no, it's just... What was it? Crash and Baxter. Crash and Baxter, retarded Calvin and Hobbes. Hey. Sorry, special needs Calvin and Hobbes. You got a little tattoo on your wrist there. What is it? It's in honor of Peter Pan. Big childhood thing of yours? Not the cartoon one, though. I was in my middle school production of Peter Pan, and fucking recast. How bad were you? You know, I don't really think I was that bad. So it was this guy having a dream and he was gonna... He was scared about, like, doing poorly on some test or something. So he, like, goes into the room, and the test is in a different language, and it's, like, okay, whatever. He's really concerned and lost, and then all of a sudden I show up, and I'm, like, his fucking dream girl. And I just, like, start seducing him for no reason except that the guy they, like, hired to play that guy isn't even an actor so he, like, is just really uncomfortable with the whole thing. I mean, I was too, but at least I tried. - Hm. - And it, uh, yeah. - I am so sorry. - Uh-huh. No, really, I'm deep... From the bottomless depths of my heart... I know. I apologize for that experience that you had to go through that. It was a series, too. There were, like, three episodes. It was like all the same dream. Wow! Wow! So you had to do it three times? - Uh-huh. - Who are these people? Why do they even try anymore? - I don't fucking know, dude. - Goodness! Oh, yeah. I just wanted him to, like, wake up from the dream. This is weird. Like, wake the fuck up. And then, like, start a whole new plot that was slightly better. Maybe they should have hired you as the writer. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's pretty bad. What about you? Any shitty experiences? You know... You know... Yours was pretty bad, but I don't think it was quite as bad as my web series. - Oh, I doubt it. - Oh, yeah? - Uh-huh. - I was Cloud Boy. - Cloud Boy? - Mm-Hm. Oh, yeah, you don't understand. I had to run around in baby blue spandex saving people with the power of the clouds. Try to figure that one out. What are... What are the power of the clouds? You know what? Their special effects department was so bad I didn't even know when I saw the fucking product. - Oh, my God. - Yeah. - Oh! - Whatever. Oh, yeah, Cloud Boy. There's, like, literally everything else on the fucking planet, and then there's Cloud Boy. - Classic. - Oh. So, yeah. Um... What did you cross over from? Modelling? You do not think I was a model. Well, I mean, hey, whatever it was, I'm sure it's better than what the fuck this shit is. Dude, I've been working here for two years. I still don't know what the fuck this job is. - Two years? - Uh-huh. Two years? Holy shit. Can't imagine being here for two years. Are you, like, saving for something? Yeah. Greece. Why Greece? I don't know. Why not? I could think about Mykonos sometimes, and just waking up at a little portside village. No one to tell where I am, no one to set me straight, just... swimming until I drown. Oh, the ocean there is fucking perfect, like, you've never seen anything more blue in your entire life. And all the different versions of me, like, the me that I am at home, or the me here at work or with strangers and the parties and friends and whatever, like, they're all gone, and there's just this one singular me, and... no one to disappoint. But, yeah. How about you? Some fucking dream, huh? It's all right. So are you guys a thing? No, no, we're not a thing. - Well, then, what do you want? - Well... Oh, you... Oh, no. - She's pregnant? - Barry, no! Stop! - What? I don't want... I'm... - Just can you... Do you need to borrow some money? I saw her paycheck. Oh! - I was... - Barry. - What? - She makes less than me. - Of course, she does. - She makes less than me. Yeah, she can't work as many hours as you. - Yeah, but... - But, but, but nothing. She has her own thing going on. What works for Rachel works for me, and we're all happy. Fuck! It's impossible to talk to you. I know. It's just tough sometimes. But you know what? - Don't do that again, okay? - But you... - Come on... - Barry, no... - Just calm down. Be happy. - Stop it. So, anyways, how long does this normally take? Oh, the installation doesn't take long at all. It's an hour or maybe less. Wow! That's really fast. This is so sweet. Do you make this? I do. Actually, my husband and I, you know. Oh, my gosh. That's precious. You know, Clarke had... He had one just like this. He got it in Chechnya, right? Wow! I didn't even know they made art like that in Chechnya. - Yeah, well we... - It got busted, though, right? - Oh. - Yeah. It kind of broke on the flight. Yeah, so we're actually in the market for a new one. - How much is this? - Oh, that's 32.95. Okay. All right. Do you want it? What made you wanna go over there? Well, I was studying. Oh, right. Right, right, right. Isn't it like super intense over there? It was okay. It was okay when it wasn't... - Yeah, I go to UCLA. - Oh, great school. They do combat training before they send them out there. It's a new initiative. We're super safe and everything. That's so good. 'Cause he... he majors in, uh... What is this? Yeah, I... Uh... Slavic sculpture and design. Slavic sculpture and design. Wow! That's incredible. Emphasis in ceramics. Very unique. You should see him on that pottery wheel. I love it. So you're, what, taking a semester off for now? Yeah, yeah, you know, sometimes you got to just take a step back and, you know, get some fresh air. His mom got sick, actually. - Sorry to hear that. - Sorry. Is she doing better now? Uh, yeah. Yeah. She's... She is doing better now. She's in remission, yeah. Oh, good. Great. Yeah, last year was a little hectic for... - Yeah. - But... Yeah, going to Chechnya and... and studying abroad, that was the highlight of it all. That was totally worth it. Did you have a translator? Clarke speaks Russian. - No. Of course, why... - I don't. - Yeah. - He does. You're lying. Well, he was the translator of the group. He's fluent. - No, I'm not. - That's incredible. I'm... I'm really not good. Come on. What's the... What's... What's the word for "thank you"? Really, I'm not that proficient. Oh my, please, I suck at other languages so I mean it, it would be a pleasure to hear anything. Well, you want a word? Uh, here's a word. - Okay. The word for thank you? - Yeah. Thank you. Um... What? Oh, what? That's amazing. Oh, my God. Okay. More. More. What's another one? Another one I like to use is, uh... What does it mean? Well, that one simply put, it means good business, but when Russians say it to each other, they mean, "Pleasure doing business with you." Hmm. Very nice. Which brings us to this. So you actually speak Russian? I was in a Russian immersion program at my college. - Was supposed to be in Russia. - But what? You just took it in the dorms and watched Russian movies? No, really? What, you sat around pretended you were in Russia? College was so much fun. Now your parents want you to go back? Yeah. Are you worried it's gonna be as bad as you remember? It's gonna be as bad. Even if you move off campus, you get an apartment or something? I don't know. All I know is that when I was there, I just felt really... not just alone but... I've been there. I'm not gonna tell you that it won't, might even be worse, but... What I can tell you is that it... It does feel different when you're 22. - Really? - Oh, yeah. I mean, you're already a different person. Maybe it won't be so bad next time. - Shit. I'm... I'm so sorry. - It's all right. Hello? Hello? Yeah, this is he. Sure. Yeah, I can do that time. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, thanks. Okay. Okay, cool. Yeah, thanks. Who was that? Your mom didn't actually get cancer, did she? - I got a callback. - What? What? That's awesome. What's it for? Just for some little indie film... about college, ironically. Kind of pretentious, kind of cool. Dude. I mean, I haven't gotten it yet. So be happy. You... You walked in there. You didn't give a fuck, and they loved you for it. I actually gave, like, 10,000 fucks. Even so. No, it's really weird. I didn't expect that one to be the one. Like, you didn't see me. I was really bad. No, no, no, I was fucking atrocious. I was just some just nervous wreck the whole time. Maybe that's why they liked you. Do you wanna go see a movie? What? Yeah, right here. - Is there anything good here? - No. - Then why would I wanna go... - Because fuck it. - Uh... - What do you say? Fuck it. - Is this you? - Yep. All right, all right, all right. Thanks. Well, tonight was a lot of fun. Yeah. It was a lot of fun. I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. No, I've made things really fucking awkward sometimes. It's really fucking stupid. Stop. That... I'm a fucking mess. I'm so stupid. I'm sorry. That's not true. Trust me. Do you wanna come inside? Just for a little bit? Uh... Yeah, sure. I got this place with some of my friends. I have to shower at the gym every day, though, 'cause the water is fucked. Shared rooms, all right? It's cheap, so it does the job. So do you wanna sit down? Yeah, sure. You didn't have to pay for my ticket, by the way. Of course, I did. Clearly. Sorry I'm... I'm just fucking with you. Do you want some water or coffee or something? Uh... Water sounds good. Thank You. Thanks for the movie. Yeah. Yeah, no problem. No problem. So... - I'll... I'll see you tomorrow? - Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow. But, yeah, thank you for the water and for showing me your place. - Yeah. - And... Yeah, okay. Bye. Okay. Sorry I shut down last night. - No, no. I outstayed my welcome. - It's not you. I just... You... You really don't have to make me feel better. I... I should have respected your space. I don't really go to movies. Me neither. I used to. My dad and I would go and tell my mom we were at temple. You weren't alone? Not with him. He likes some shit. You know Cannibal Holocaust? That's legitimately horrifying. My dad's name is Norman. What's he like? I don't know. Haven't seen him since Peter Pan. Like from middle school? Weren't you recast? He didn't get the memo. They divorced? - I'm sorry. - No, it's fine. I'm happy she's happy. He still calls on Christmases. What do you talk about? Another world shit, mostly. Sometimes Mom, animal crackers. Asshole. Asshole. What? Rachel Zeitlyn? Mm-Hm? Nothing. It's... That's a... It's a really beautiful name. I like it. The reason I don't go to the movies anymore is because the last time I did, my friend molested me. What? Not in the theater. Like, after. I don't have to talk about it. No, no. It's okay. - I mean, are you sure? - Yeah. We were kind of close. I kind of got the vibe from him sometimes, but... I'm sorry, is this... No, it's... it's okay. It's okay. Feel free to stop me whenever. He wanted to see Argo. I did, but I was still down. I got him the Sour Patch Kids, and he got me Dippin' Dots. Halfway in, he tells me that he loves me. Are you okay? Yeah. I don't wanna hurt his feelings, so... But I didn't feel the same way. Anyway, movie is over and we had a good talk in the car. He dropped me off at home and he went inside. You're sweating. So... I start to take my clothes off and... And yes. He told me, "I don't wanna live without you." And... just... I'm sorry. I... Are you okay? Clarke. Please say something. You don't need to know that. Nobody needs to know that. I was just like... It's not fair for you to have to deal with my shit. I mean, I could have stopped, but I'm just so fucked up I don't have it any other way. You're right. I'm fucking disgusting. I'm sorry. Please don't hate me. Hey, Clarke. What happened to your eye? - It's nothing. - Do you want some ice? Don't worry about it. I'm fine, okay? I'm good. I'm really fucking good. Fuck, I'm so sorry. Fuck. It seems like you've had a pretty rough day. Yeah, I'm really sorry about that. Fuck. Do you wanna talk about it? Okay. Um, so just tell me about yourself. What? Hm. Did you go to college? Yeah. What was that like? What do you mean? Huh, what was college like for you? Do you not want me to read this? Honestly, forget about the script. Just tell me what college was like for you. Well, I went and I made some friends, I went to some parties, you know, the whole shebang. There's not really much else to say than that. The whole thing was kind of a blur. I don't really remember it one way or another. You're really fucking creepy. Uh... I mean... you give me these... looks, and just... how you're acting. It's... You just... You're... You remind me of a pervert and... honestly, you're just making me really uncomfortable. What are you gonna do with your life? Just sit around all day doing nothing? Who on Earth would wanna go through that? It's just so fucking stupid. Honestly, your life is just pathetic, and it's really sad to just watch you even try. Why do you try? There's no point in you trying. You're not special. Just stop. You've reached Rachel Zeitlyn. Congrats. Now leave a message so I know what your deal is. Oh. Oh? I thought you were gonna be someone else. Little disappointing. I was hoping to get a hit in, but... - What the f... - Happy to see you. What the fuck is going on? What are you doing? Well, I am packing up my shit because I am leaving. Uh... What? Rachel quit. And so did I. You what? And honestly, so should you. - Ah, okay. - I don't know where she is. What's that? Have a great life, Clarke. What the fuck is wrong with you? Hey, dude. Dude, you know what? Just fuck off. - All right? Just fuck off. - Fuck yourself. Rachel, come on. Seriously? You're gonna make me chase you. - Hi. - Hi. Rachel, I am so fucking sorry. I don't know what's wrong with me. I just... I... All I ever do is hurt people, and I just... I can't figure myself out. I can't fucking... I don't fucking... I saw your video. The... I fucking love you. What? I love you more than anything. I wanna tell you that it's real. Promise? Okay. What? I love you. I'm sorry. I just... I had to... I had to get that one off my chest. You love me? More than anything. You really fucking hurt me. I know. I know. Fuck. And I wish... I wish I could take it back. I promise you, I will never ever, ever hurt you again. Promise? Promise. Okay. Rachel. I'm sorry. No. I said it. You are my best friend, but this... This isn't helping me. I can't give you what you need. - You already do. - No. - You do. - You don't understand. Then help me understand. Help me. Just tell me what to do, and I will do it. I will... It doesn't matter. Don't give up on me. I can't be your only reason to keep going. I knew this was gonna happen. If I don't leave right now... - No. - I'm never gonna leave. Please. Please. You're everything to me. Exactly. Fuck you. Fuck you. Goodbye, Clarke. 7:19 a.m. Hey, buddy. It's me. Oh, we need to have a little business meeting tonight. Why don't you come by my townhouse? I'll get something to eat or something, okay? Don't go by the airport. Call me. It's been a while, huh? How you been? Well, you look fantastic, if I might say so myself. What do you think about the place? I like it. I mean, you know that mansion was just for show, you know, and I always thought it was a bit much. Bet it fooled you, huh? Still mad at me. I get it. You know, you do you. But the company... This company is good. You know, I used to have Justine for this. Have you seen her around since she quit? You sure? You haven't seen her? Mm-hm. I mean, you probably don't wanna be my sloppy seconds or anything. But you haven't seen her? Well, that's too bad. That's too bad 'cause, you know, I also haven't been able to find my flash drive. Do you think she took it? Is that a yes? You're not sure. Mm. I mean, I'm not mad. That's... No, you know, I just wanna straighten... Straighten this whole thing out. She took everything. Everything. She completely emptied my accounts. I have no money. Where is she, Clarke? Clarke, where is she? Belize, in the Canary Islands? You got to help me with this, Clarke! Sorry. You're not gonna make this easy, are you? I don't want to be here. All of this is bullshit. I can't even do illegitimate. I fucked that up. Uh... I don't wanna be here. I don't... I don't wanna move back to Flagstaff. And I don't wanna go back to school, not on a half million dollars in debt. You don't even care, do you? Of course, not. You only care about you, right? Oh, yeah, fucking walk away, pussy. You fucking prick. Go back to Rachel. Run, cry to her. She'll just take it. Fucking kike. I wasn't gonna use it. I was... I was just theatric. Oh, fuck. - Barry? - Yeah? - What are you doing? - Nothing. Well, I need help now. Okay. I need help now. I need help unloading. Yeah. Yeah? Hey, buddy. Mom? Um... Is everything okay? Yeah. I'm good. You... Oh, okay, I'm just checking in. Yeah, I'll talk to you later. What? Where did that come from? No, just go do your thing. Don't worry about it. What happened? Something happened today? - What's going on? - Nothing happened. Clearly something... Nothing happened. I swear. I'm just tired. That's all. Honestly. - Are you sure? - Yes. You can always tell me stuff, you know, like... Even if it doesn't make sense or... I know. I love you. I love you, too. What? You hung up on me. What's happening? I get half of a phone call, lots of weird messages, and... I wanna give you space and stuff, but, you know, I'm your mom. You can tell me. What's... Are you okay? No. I'm not okay. There's a lot in your plate. What's happening? What? Clarke, what's happening? So the like, I guess, it's like for people to... When they're self-doubting and when they're... They feel like everything is going wrong and they just... They're a failure... 'Cause that's what I do like right now. And I don't know why, how that suddenly sparked in me wanting talk about it and make it better, but it did. So, number one... you are you. Like, you don't ever come out just looking it like you do. And everyone is gonna say, "Oh, you need to be doing this and that,". "You should be doing this." Like, "Maybe 50% of you may succeed," or, like, "Why aren't you doing this right?" But there's only one opinion that matters, and that's the one you have by yourself, and I know it's so clichéd, like, come on. I felt like actually, if you just stop and just forget about other people's feelings, your own. Like, if I didn't hear all these critiques from other people, I would have a lot more confidence in myself. I would be a lot more ecstatic about where I am right now in my work and my... In the world, like, in my powers and skills. And I think I think that's just something that I'm gonna need to do, I think, to step back and do it, okay. If I didn't hear any of that from anyone else, how would I feel about... About it on my own. How do I feel about where I am right now and what I'm doing. So the outlook you have towards yourself will affect other people's outlook towards themselves and towards you. If you just stop focusing on that, then maybe this one girl will see you do that to yourself "and be like," Oh, I am not pretty happy with who I am. I'm not. "Help me be." What is it? It's like we live in the world where mad just makes you beautiful. If you wanna change something, the world and, in turn, people, I mean, wired people like my passion with acting. Why does anyone need to keep your approval with that, you know? And how they are a thing. I go out with these thoughts that which is where I am coming from. It is one thing that maybe you're just not ready yet. Maybe you're still have to focus. So many places to go. And, yeah, it may seem to be the only opportunity, only a chance, yes, but there will be more. It will be different. You have to fight harder, but that protects because if you get it now with trying to working hard and you still feel great about yourself, where are you gonna go from there? Stop your mind from where it's going. Goodbye, Clarke. Going down.
