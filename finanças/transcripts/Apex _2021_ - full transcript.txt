Hey. New signal. Hi, honey. Yeah, just tell your sister, I'll be home in about an hour. We're just finishing our round of golf. I love you, too. Hey! Shut up and fight. Fuck you, Rainsford. See you in the next one, Mitch. Yeah, if my luck runs out. Hey, Rain Man, I got a question. - Yeah? - Who do you think you are? - Hm. - Think you can come here and take my kill because you're some big shot doctor. I don't even want to be here. Remember your father said to you when he asked you - to run his company? - You're just too fucking slow. You're gonna send me back to rehab. Too fucking slow. That's... what? What do you even mean by that? - You know what, fuck you, man. - Mm-hmm. Congratulations on another win, Dr. Rainsford. The prey is already in your trophy room. My enthusiasm for your sport is coming to an end. Perhaps you might enjoy being the prey instead of the hunter. Don't mistake my boredom for suicidal tendencies. You are a most valued client. Prove it. Find me a real challenge. Hey, sweetheart, what's with the look? You know these guys are professionals, right? They're going to make your hunters see God. They look like gutter punk brawlers. The last prey you sold me didn't make it to midnight on the first day. Are you fucking blind? These are the best ones in the prison. They're the best ones in the whole Pacific Northwest. See that one over there? He's got more kills than Shirley fucking Temple's got curls. The prey doesn't just need to know how to kill. They need to know how to evade detection, to deceive, to plant red herrings. Not one of your prisoners would pose a real threat to the hunter. What about this one? Why have I never seen him? You don't want that one. Look, he used to be something great. He's at the end of his rope now. His numbers are off the charts. He's a fucking degenerate. You don't know half the shit that guy's done. I don't trust him. I can't trust him. He's so dangerous that we've kept him in a sensory deprivation cell since he got here. He hasn't even talked to another person in over seven years. He's broken laws that you haven't even thought of. Escaped three prisons, wanted in 47 states, broken 21 bones, in and out of jail. Who the hell is Thomas Malone? If you want your hunters to have a fucking chance, you don't want him. Hey, buddy. Are you lost? No, I'm right where I want to be. I read your file. Holy hell, sir. How are you still alive? Come closer and I'll show you. I'm literally a hologram. I have never put myself in a room with a killer. I'm your only hope. This is the end of the line. Before they put you in this cage, you owed money to the North Road 88s, the Triad, La Nostra, two cartels that I know of, a dozen West Coast loan sharks and East Coast Shylocks, the IRS, the CRA, the FRS wants you dead. I'm a popular guy. How you stayed alive this long is beyond me. The luck of the Irish. It was a waste of time coming here. Enjoy the rest of her day. You're coming on a little strong. Am I? Thomas Ernest Malone, O-neg. Fuckin' cop. What kind of cop dresses this good? I'm a game master. We have a private game set for tomorrow. It won't be broadcast. I'll take my chances here. Oh, whoop, life without parole. That's what you're facing. Win, and I can guarantee your freedom. Maybe you could settle down, visit the grandkids. Great kids? I don't have any grandkids. Yes, you do. Two. Your eldest son, Michael, he and his wife welcomed a pair of twins last year, a boy and a girl. They live up in a faraway magical land called Vancouver. Okay, I'm in. But I want them taken care of. I'm a grandfather now. Done. This is an employee agreement. You will sign your rights to Apex, a subsidiary of Zaroff Megas Industries, LLC. There's a box to write down what you want to written on your tombstone or a fun anecdote a eulogy, perhaps. Otherwise, sign and initial. Even if you lose, well, looking at the way your life is headed, death might be an upgrade. Welcome to Apex. Where all your bloody delights can be brought to life. Leave the laws of man at home and come dance on the dark side. For an unforgettable weekend. No! Apex, game on. The hunters are arriving. Their lodge will be on the north side of the island, so I recommend staying away from there. Apex is quite simple. There are six hunters. You are the prey. So what if I kill all the hunters? That has never been done. There have been some accidents in the past, but Apex has never lost a hunter. Some have been trained by the best in the world Training and experience are very different things. Precisely. So what if I kill all the hunters? Then it's game over, red rover, you win. On Apex Island, there are no laws, only winning and losing. You do these a lot? One per month. And we have a wait list for hunters longer than your... What's the price for hunting humans? Depends on the rating of the prey. 10.9 to 11. What to know how you rated? No. I expect the hunters will underestimate you. Not exactly the smartest people. Each of them come here for their own reasons. Same as you, I suppose. If the prey wins, I take solace in knowing I changed their life. You're a real saint. I always saw myself as Gandhi. Enlightenment through blood sport. Hey, these hunters, they like each other? Good luck, Mr. Malone. Lyle, my man. What's up, playboy? Well, well, well, they let you out of rehab. Yep, the old man says he'd let me back home if I get a kill before his birthday. And speaking of your dad, I've been trying to get a hold of him. He hasn't gotten back to me. Is he all right? I got this triple-A investment on me. - Yeah, yeah. - He's gonna love this. - I'll ask him to call you. - It's a bull market, my friend. No time like the present. Fear not, fear God. Fear only the women and wine. For the Good Lord has delivered, and I have arrived. What's going on us, fuckos? This fuckin' guy? West, I want to refund, alright? It's him or me. Get me out of here. Don't be such a little wuss child. Last time we did an Apex together, you almost fucking lynched me, you nut job. Don't blame me for you walking into one of my traps. What kind of monster lynches someone, Bishop? Probably your ancestors. - Relax. - Okay, easy. Whoa, whoa. - Look at you, Bishop. - Ooh, yeah. What are you benching nowadays? What does your mom weight? Is it 220 or 240? 280. She's back on the Ben and Jerry's. So what, you think the Rainmaker is going to show? I hope not. Yeah, well, you couldn't win even if your daddy paid for it. Hey, man, at least his businesses make money. Yeah, exactly remind us, how did you make your fortune, Bishop? Oh, that's right. You inherited 2 trillion from your brother. What do you got left, a billion and a half? Hm. No. The markets, they... they've gone... Nobody knows. Buy low, sell high. Pretty easy, compadre. If you learned to read, you might have had a chance of, you know, not pissing away your whole family's fortune. - You got such a big mouth. - Easy. - Not you. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, and here I was hoping for a much better class of hunter on this one. Hello, Bishop. Hello. Well, you'll get no better than me, little Jeza. Mr. Lyle. -Milady. And I don't believe we've met. I'm, uh... Well, the thing is, uh... Please excuse the boy. He's my mentally handicapped manservant. I purchased him from an orphanage out in, oh, Brooklyn, actually. - Seriously. - Tap out already. Hey, animals. - Ah! - Get off. Carrion, you cunt. I thought you got religion or another wife or some sort of shit like that. You don't talk to me. Ever. You know, if you got something to say, why don't you look at me? Carrion, play nice. Okay. We're all friends here. All right? We're all mates, except Ecka. Nobody really likes that guy. Whoa. Come on. Come on. We doing this again? Guys. - Got you. - Hey. Come on. Show me what we can do. You think you're strong, but you're just tall. Is that the best you've got? Is that it? Dr. Rainsford. Let's begin. My good hunters, welcome to Apex. Allow me to introduce your toys for the weekend. Only the best for the best. A weapon for every weapon in this room. State of the art, oiled, and maintained by our team of armorers Ha-ha, very funny. Our Ã  la carte offerings include thoroughbreds, mongrels, and dirt bikes. Remove them all. - Sir? - We don't want the prey stealing another bike, now do we? Anybody got a problem with that? Good. Babe, time to show us the turkey. You have the pleasure, the honor of hunting one Thomas Malone. Malone the mutilator? Is he a special forces or something? A name like that makes me think IRA or SAF. This is going to be good. Oh, come on now, show us his mug. Who the hell is that? He'll be dead the second he slips and breaks his hip. A little long in the back nine, don't you think? Thomas Malone could be the greatest prey any of you have faced. Him. Yeah. Typically the prey is ex-special forces, a Green Beret, a ranger, but Malone, he's an ex-cop, kicked off the force for intemperance. So he's been moonlighting as a hit man? What? What's the deal? Yeah, it looks a bit more like a mercenary, don't you think? No. No, he developed a crippling gambling addiction and lost custody of his children. All right. Listen. Do we get a refund if we kill this guy within an hour? Certainly. What I've failed to mention is this. Malone has defied death more times than most Navy SEALs. He always happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Injuries. Broken ribs and a compressed spine from leaping off a building, over 60 concussions. Sole survivor of a train crash, shot in the back at an airport, drove a car through a plane. - What? - But five years ago, he was convicted of murder in a burglary gone wrong. I could go on, but we'd be here all night. The man hasn't lived an easy life. Okay, yeah, sure, but my third wife's shih-tzu looks like it has a better bite than this guy. This feels like elderly abuse. Am I right? Pardon my French, but the man is a motherfucker. He defies every basic testicle algorithm used by the Apex to select its prey. Simply put, the universe just can't seem to kill him. Maybe some in this room can. Well, he hasn't met me yet. To the hunt? Ooh. To the hunt. Hmm. Hmm. Well, fuck it. Hey, it's my size. At least I'll be comfortable. Now, judging by the wind speed, the weather, climate, I wonder if he'll go south. Of course you do. East. He has to know daylight gives him better visibility. Maybe the old man's got cataracts. Is that even in the file? Bright red? Is you senile? Hey, I got a question. You're coming through loud and clear to all. Can hunters kill other hunters? Technically, yes. There are no rules against it. Yeah, that sounds like fun. You a sadist? The hunt ends with the chorus of bells. Trust me, you'll know it when you hear it. You will have a three-hour head start. Good luck, Mr. Malone. Welcome to Disneyland. You really think you're going to need those? Why don't you mind your own business? Wow. Really? Can you put your finger on here for a second for me? - So funny. - Just for a second. - Just put it on for a second. - So clever. - Just... I'll show you. - Don't touch me. Ah! It's not ready yet. The logical move is to work together as a unit. Let's lure them into a trap. Jeza, Carrion. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No teams. Yeah, how about everyone for themselves? None of this team bullshit. Fine. Let him pick you off one at a time. Yeah, right. Classic story of hunter versus prey. And who is that hunter? Lyle. The efficient. No, that doesn't work. How about... Lyle the fearless. Fuckin' bugs. He walks stealthily through the forest, checking the canopy for something that might be lurking. Watch. Moving. Where are you, you little bastard? What the fuck? Oh. Okay, West. That better not leave a bruise, or I'm suing your ass. Prepare to die, skeleton. Come on. Oh, great. Piece of shit. Okay, West. West, can I get a depot out here? Oh. Ah. Invisible Depot now, huh? Yeah, safety issue. That is going in my 3-star Yelp review. Hey, West, does your holographic ass have anything other than water? Oh. Now, that is the taste of Mexico. Gracias! Only the best for an apex predator! I am king of the jungle because I am afraid of sh... Oh, holy crap, Rainy. Pretty light in the loafers, huh? What a hit? Why are you here? I, uh... I tracked him. I think I think I saw him coming this way. No, I mean, on the island. Same as you. No. No, not actually. Here to hunt the prey, you know, better myself. Plus I read in Forbes that all the top CEOs do this shit. So why are you here? Because I want to be, okay? What about you? I'm here because I know I can walk through the shadow of shadowed valley of death and fear no evil because I'm with me. And through the trial and tribulation, I know I'll grow stronger. You really... Excuse me? No, it's not complicated on why you're here, bro. All right? You're a sick fuck. I'd stop talking if I were you. Just embrace it, amigo. No more words, Lyle. See, I'm here because I'm a fucking warrior and I was born to do this shit. I would bet my entire empire on the fact that you wouldn't pull the trigger on the prey if you had the chance. Yeah, whatever. Excuse me? Nothing. No, feel free to speak, Lyle. Okay, well, I say this with all due respect and deference, but you are fucked in the head. We all know what you did. So you... You're not some... some paragon of fuckin' excellence. You killed your wife, bro. So you can save me the sanctimonious "Oh, I'm here to better myself" bullshit. And you can put that down. Man, if this was the real world and you and I got in the scrap, I'd tear your fucking head off, bro. It's a good thing we're not in the real world. Ah! Fuck are you doing? That? Aah! Okay. Hey, hey, hey, listen, you win, okay? You win. Alright? You win. I do win. That's all I do. Hello, hello, Dr. King of Kings. He was like this when I got here. I told you we should've hunted together. He certainly didn't last long. Well, Lyle had it coming. Huh? Survival of the fittest. Is this your doing? It is, isn't it, you cheeky fuck. Have the rules changed? Who's the prey now? When we get back to the real world, I'm gonna ask you to do me a favor, and you're going to do what I ask. Why would I ever say yes? There's a difference between what's right and what's legal. You don't want a guy like me going around telling stories about what you did. But don't worry, I can keep a secret. What secret? Well, that I was created in God's image, the pinnacle of perfection. If God was a deaf, dumb, blind, racist, misogynistic, walking case of Dutch, then sure. You need to read the Old Testament. Zephaniah 3:8 is all that and more. - Hmm. - That savage. The prey must have store his gun, right? Should we worry about this old man? -Nah, he just got cocky. Turned his back at the wrong moment. Where'd you get that? At the depot? Okay, just leave me alone. I don't want to help you do that. What did you just say? Fight. - Fuck off already. - Fight. You know, any time, any place, pal. - Yeah, right now, huh? - Fight. What are you at? Come on. - Shh, shh. - Hey. Prey's trying to get in our head, man. Look what he did to Lyle. - Fuck, let's go. - Quiet. Is there something out there? Let's find out. All right. Here's what I think we should do. Shut up. We're going to go northeast. Everyone start a grid. Don't let him get past you. I'm going to go south and force him out. Oh, so you can corner him? Piss off. Yeah, all for none and none for all, right? That's it. I'll have his head by sunset. Yeah, you ought to take a wager on that. Your head for his if you don't. This is not the best course of attack. We should be coordinating our efforts. Why don't you just let them chase the little bastard? And then you might get a chance to kill another one of us. When we get back to lodge, why don't you and I pour one out for Lyle? He did kind of deserve it. Fuckin' hell, man. You see what he did to Lyle? - What, are you scared? - What? You want take a timeout? Fuck that, man. Lyle was one of us. This is going in my trophy room, alright? Come over here. He's here. He left a trail even your dumb ass can find. Uh, did you ever consider that maybe you're walking into a trap? Well, you're here, too. So what does that say? Maybe I'm here to look out for you. Fuckin' liar, men. You know, you killing the prey, it's not going to earn the love of your father. Don't start. Don't start with that shit. You need a lot thicker skin to survive in this world, son. I'm dangerous, man. I'm fucked in the head. Broken beyond repair. According to psych on the East Coast. Sure you are, boy. Sure you are. You think you're better than me? Well, I know I am. I'm stronger, better looking. I'm richer. For now. I live for the day you go broke, and it's coming. You live for the that your daddy says he's proud of you. Guess what. That's not going to happen any time soon. I'll tell you what. You can call me daddy if you want to. Oh, fuck. Christ, man, get up. Use your strength. Well, you cocked that one up. Oh, fuck. Use me as a human shield. Thank you for that. It wasn't like that, man. Just come down here and help me up, man. Beg me. That's it. I'm done. I'm done with this fucking game, man. Just get me out of here and get me back to the lodge, man. You should crawl back. It's a confidence builder. You know? Didn't you learn about fortitude and perseverance in rehab? Or I could just save you the pain, end it for you. Fuck... fuck off and die, man. Be easier for everyone. Ah! Fuck! No, no, no. I'm not the prey. You can't kill me. Are you telling me what to do now? That's so pathetic. You've always been my little brother! What are you're doing this to me?! I was there for you. You always, always did things. Driving crazy, right? I can't stand you. I can't stand you. I tried to help you, I tried to help you. I tried to save you. I... I couldn't. What?! What?! What? Cutting them off? Why'd you let me do that? Watch it. You almost took off my fucking head. Is that your blood? Ecka. The prey threw him off the cliff. Yeah, I tried to save him. But he almost vivisected the poor sod. Where's the body? Why? His father will pay for it. Give him a proper funeral. That's why. Hm. Well, it'd have to be a closed casket, that's for sure. Slashed him to ribbons, the prey did. I do win. That's all I do. A little early for a celebration, isn't it? I tracked the prey to the northeast corner of the island. He's savvy, knows how to throw his scent. Whatever. We'll make him bleed for what he did to Lyle. A man like that never should have come to a place like this. Oh? Poor Lyle. Your wife was a really lucky woman. Yes, she was. Someone's going to have to tell his family. The prey did this? Bishop. Why? For fun. Bishop doesn't leave the island. Huh. This place ain't so bad. Whoa. To fuck shit up... or not. Mm. Hmm. Oh, yeah. This is the good stuff. I wouldn't do that if I were you. I would go easy on the berries. The fruit here bites back. This island was deemed uninhabitable after the war. I picked it up for the cost of a pair of red bottomed heels. - For real? - For real. The constant bombardment of tachyon radiation has mutated the berries, imbued them with a concentrated culture of viridis, a highly potent hallucinogenic also known as psilocybin ayahuasca. You're about a trip some serious balls. It doesn't bother me. Can't wait until they kick in. Are we in open waters? North of Japan, west of Hawaii. Six more hours to go, friend. Just make it until sunset, and you're in the clear. I thought it's fair to tell you that Mr. Bishop has been declared prey by the remaining hunters. Perhaps you want to team up with him. Yeah. That won't be happening. Some hunters do like a fair fight. I don't think you really know what that means. They don't play by the rules in the real world. So why would it be any different here? Why don't you ask them to face me one on one? No guns, no tricks. That would be like asking a jackal to stop eating meat. Did you like a gift this morning? I'd like my lighter back, please. Well, why don't you come and get it? Six hours, Mr. Malone, and then your free. Shit. If order 90 million... No. 129 million in Lyle MFG mediation stock. Confirm order. Thank you, Lyle. Once word gets out that you're dead, share price in your company will skyrocket. You're going to make me a billionaire by the time I'm 25. Fuck, I love this game. Fuck. West? West? Hello, there. Didn't anyone ever tell you you never smoke in the field. That's so perfect there. Deactivate the mine. Now, Bishop. You know, if you weren't so caught up on trying to make money off Lyle's spilt blood, you never would have been standing there. A girl's got to eat. I wonder what the hell you're even doing here? Why'd you come to Apex? You're hunting hunters' pocketbooks. Little inside trading. Hm. Like I said... A girl's got to eat. Okay, just relax, put the gun down, please. You know I'm a friendly. Take one more fucking step, and you won't be getting friendly with anyone again. There's no need to be mean. It's just you and I, Jeza. Nobody else. Carrion? Rainsford? Malone? Easy pickings. You sure about that? I haven't been so certain in my entire life. Well, we won't have to wait long to find out. You're fair game now. Oh? Rainsford could take you. I'd pick him as my favorite. Hm. You know what? You and I, we should team up. We could take over the place. You, me, we could become the next Rainsford. It'd be easy. We'd be like little birds. What the fuck are you doing? Just relax. What the fuck are you doing? Just relax. Is this some kind of seizure? What the fuck is this, Bishop?! You dance with the devil, you best make sure that you put on your Sunday shoes. 'Cause if you miss that even once, well, I tell you, he'll own you forever. Now, that wasn't very nice! Deactivate this fucking thing, Bishop. Only way that that fucking thing will be deactivated is if I do it. Fine. Let's come to an understanding. Like a deal? A bargain. Alright. You can trust me. Yeah? It's okay. Total control. You can have all of it. Oh, you fuckin' b... Hm. Yikes, old man. I don't think that's how you start today going, huh? Well... We may as well get it over us. Hm? Let's get this show on the road. Beg me. Shoot me! You're not scared? It's impossible to be scared when you're already dead. If only. I'm the youngest out of six boys. Every one of my brothers, they... they all just wanted to chase more, chase more money, more, more, more, more, more, more, more. Every single one of them died of a heart attack. Jeza, you can't take any money with you. So they're dead. I'm not. I'm standing right here. And I'm going to live like I'm already dead. Actually not a bad line. I might steal that. It's the truth. Hmm? We're all dead. Even the lucky. Even the beautiful. Shakespeare? Mm. That was me. Okay, dead man, when we get back to the real world, you're signing over your share of your family's estate to me to manage. Whatever makes you happy. Deal? - It's a bargain. - Hmm. Good boy. Now stay. Psychotic bastard. Oh, come on! What the fuck is that, Bishop?! Quit fucking around! Looks like a couple more detonators, don't it? I... okay, okay, okay. Let me get my head... I need to get this clear. I put two land mines down. And I got two detonators So if I... we got a 50/50 chance. If I hit one of these detonators, one of us is going to go boom. Uh... so, yeah. No, you wouldn't do it, Bishop. Ah, yeah. Mm. What do you think hell's service for dinner tonight? 'Cause I would love a little side of Jeza! Bishop, you are not that psychotic. Okay? Don't do this. I what to do it! This is not the game anymore. Okay? We're meant to be hunting Malone, not each other. Please, for the love of God, don't. - Are you sure? - Bishop. Are you sure? Because let's just find out. Don't do it. - Why don't we just find out?! - Don't... Say hello to my bloodline for me! Fucking c... Fuck this. Where'd she go? Jeza? Jeza? Huh. Empty. Fuck. West, give me a depot. Give me a fucking depot! What the... Come on. I'm a little disappointed. West said that you're special, but this was far too easy. You're running around the forest with an empty gun, you old fuck. I bet you put all the bullets in my back, you fucking cock sucking bastard. I saw it in a movie once. Yeah, seems like you've been around the block a few too many times. Motherfucker, I made the block. Yeah, step out. Come on. Come on. I don't want to be chasing you around the forest. Couldn't be bothered. You didn't have to kill the kid. Maybe, maybe not. How do you like being hunted? It's all about perspective. Hm? I'm as dangerous now as I've ever been. And maybe an alliance. We could be even more dangerous together than ever. Even the odds. I always bet on myself. That's the kind of bullshit that the Rainmaker would say. That's the guy that killed the blonde? You sly fuck. You were hiding in the bushes, weren't you? He doesn't look like he's all that. Don't underestimate Rainsford. We want big game hunting in Africa with nothing but steel machetes and our gold balls. And we killed a dozen rhinos, and I'm not ashamed to say that he got most of them. Hm? And what makes you think that you could take out a man who kills just as easily as he breathes? Yeah. He sounds like he's a force of nature. I don't know if I can beat him. And I wouldn't want him to know that I know his secrets. Now, what about you? You think you could take him? Kill me... that's game over. He goes back to his ivory tower, and you go back to that cave that you crawled out of. But if it was me and I thought I could beat him, I'd take my shot. About to go find out. Yeah, you go do that. You change your mind, you know where to find me. Choose wisely. Well, look at you. Sitting here at dark all by yourself. Sippin' tea, tinkering with his toys. You know, I'm really not interested in learning if you can talk me to death. Well, before this gets all primeval.... ...I propose a parlay. Huh. All right. First, Ecka. Why? Lyle, why? Because I wanted to. Same. No, no. No, I want it to. You had to. You ready? For a spot of dinner? Sure. What are you thinking? You're on the menu tonight, old sport. Hm. Well, what am I going to do? Well, first, I think you'd reach for that hunting knife that you just took over there. Maybe you can close the distance before I get a shot off with this rifle. You'll miss. I never do. Not from this range. But now that I've said that, maybe you'll reach for that pistol because you know that West always keeps them loaded. You're a good aim. Maybe you'll get a shot off before I do. Maybe. I'm just extrapolating potential outcomes based on what I know about you. Well, then you should know that consequentialism isn't my style. Huh. You see, you fancy yourself some kind of agent of chaos. I find you're rather predictable. Says the most vanilla man in the world. Maybe. You know, maybe I won't even use my rifle. It's too easy. You're a strange bird, Rainy. You remember that bullshit fundraiser that we did a while back? I remember your wife. She took me out back. When I was doing up my zipper, she... she warned me. She warned me about you. She said she was scared of you, said she was scared of what you're capable of. She had every right to be scared of you, didn't she? I do regret what happened to her. Oh, yeah, because you lost your temper. Or it was an accident? No. No, I just want to see if I had it in me. You called for backup? Hello, Carrion. Are you ready to have a little bit of fun? Hm? One versus two? All right. I love a good threesome. Blades and fists only. Uh, no. No, I think we should give him a little bit of a chance. You can do what you want. I'm not going to fight him. I'm going to kill him. You want to kill me. Then why did to bring... Ooh. Jeza would love this. Yeah, Jeza won't be loving anything right now. Where'd you get that? Where did you get that?! Jeza gave it to me. Yeah. Pain is what I was giving her, huh? You get what I mean? You sick son of a bitch. What the hell did you do? Let's just say that she had a date with one of my land mines. It ended with a bang! Where is she?! Where is she?! She's a little bit everywhere. Come on, motherfucker! Come on! Here you go. Who you calling vanilla? I'll see you real soon. Huh. My kill, ergo, my trophy. You got a problem with that? Good. A lion in the savanna catches a zebra. Do know what they call that? Lunch. Exactly. A hunt. A real hunt is when both hunter and prey can reason to do this, and most crucially, have the means and desire to want to draw blood. What's your point? My point is... my heart is at ease in a place like this. My senses are at 11. Each second is life and death. Out there, they have a drug for everything, but none of that can make me feel the way that I do in here, at complete peace. Well, there's something more to it. We can both agree she deserved a better death. What do you say you and I go hunt down Malone. Yeah, I'm not going anywhere with you. You're sick. So are you, Mr. Carrion. So are you. In the real world, they would call us monsters for what we do in here, but we're not interested in the real world, now, are we? I just came here to hunt a guy. Bullshit. You're hoping in that moment of death that you will feel alive again. Yeah, no disrespect, but you're more fucked in the head than anyone I've ever met. Oh, we both are, Mr. Carrion, but we build empires. We cure cancer. We put feet on Mars. But yet, we're still human, and to be human, you have to reckon with the Quixotic ideal that we are good people. That the evil illness isn't always gnawing at the edges of our mind. No, Mr. Carrion, we're not sick. We are aware. We're hunters. It's the parade that is sick. It's the Thomas Malones of the world that are sick. Look what he's doing to us. Pitting us against each other, brother against brother. No, Mr. Carrion, we must destroy Malone, or he will destroy us. How about this? One dollar to the man who takes Malone's head. I hate forests. Fuck nature. Fuck dirt, hills. Especially fuck trees. Whew! I would go easy on the berries. You're about your trip some serious balls. Malone! Come out of hiding! Let's finish the game! Ugh! No mas. Say it! I want to hear you say it. No mas. N... No... No mas. Oh, yeah, fuck. Yeah. You're good. Kid, I'm better than good. I'm bacon and eggs on Sunday morning. I never want to see you again. Yeah. I can live with that. If I live. Why the fuck would you come here? You get off on this? I mean... being this close to death makes you feel... alive. What about you? You're fighting pretty hard to live, for a guy who doesn't seem to really give a fuck. I got a reason to live. Oh, yeah. What's that? Grandkids. Two of them. I wasn't a good father. But maybe... Maybe I can make good on this. I got a kid. I got a kid. How old? He's 4. He's 4 years old. This gun's too heavy. What else you got? Carrion, check in. Carrion, check in. Carrion? Huh. West. I'd like to buy five mongrels, please. Let's remind Malone who is the hunter and who is the prey. Whoo! A life of luxury to the legend who kills him. I want my trophy. I want him to know who he is. Seal his destiny and bring me the head of Thomas Malone! Hey, you got anything real that I can eat? I'm starving. Yeah, there's plenty. Great. Where? Where?! Back at the lodge. There nothing in... It's over? I win? Oh. Mongrels. What the fuck is a mongrel? Hey! You hear me? Sometimes hunters, they use them to flush out prey. And congratulations. Rainsford's never use them on a person before. So, hey, that's something. Yeah. Yeah, I feel really honored. This man, he's... He's perfect. West, I want more mongrels. I don't give a shit. Make them find them. I don't care. Just get me more mongrels. Now! Mr. Malone. Well... Fuck. Where's Carrion? We came to an understanding. How unpredictable. You truly are a specimen, Mr. Malone. Don't sell yourself short. You're a real piece of work. Oh, you have no idea. No, I think I got you figured out. Do you? Your some kind of joy killer. No. I'm the pinnacle of civilized man. Civilized? Christ. See, I hunt to learn about myself, to reflect on why I am who I am. All this time, I, uh, thought that you were a super villain. Even better. I'm an apex warrior. You're an idiot. Well, I control the largest pharmaceutical company this world has ever known. I'm a trillionaire, self-made, thrice over. So? You're a rich idiot. And an asshole. I'm not going to lower myself to argue with you. Your destiny... My destiny is to make sure that you fuck off. How crass. You are my ultimate trophy. You always have been. I don't even think West knows what you mean to me. I got a question for you, though. How'd that tomb feel? What about those cages? Little claustrophobic at times, tight? I am going to hang your head in my trophy case, forever mine. My prey. One of us is not leaving this island. If you say so. But remember, I am Dr. Samuel Rainsford. I am the future of my species. I am an apex warrior! Did you rehearse that? That? No. Well, maybe. The point is, I've got you dead to rights. It is a statistical impossibility that you survive and I don't. So you're only logical choice is to beg. Beg me to let you live. Well, that's not how I do things. Concede. This ain't that kind of fight. I do win. That's all I do. Ah!
