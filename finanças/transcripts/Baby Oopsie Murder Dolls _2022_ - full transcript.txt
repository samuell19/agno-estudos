[wind whooshing] [bats flapping] [slow organ music] - Tiny hellish demons disguised as play things for children. Diminutive beasts who thrive on fear and pain, who feast on the souls of those who dare cross their path. My goodness. They will mount in numbers until their army rises and opens the gates to... toy hell... led by... the toy master. The crazy lady wasn't so crazy after all. He, after all he who possesses this wicked tome controls the toy master's will. Beware of the toys. Well, I possess it now, buddy. We'll see about that. [mysterious theme music] [childlike yelling] - [Toy] You're stepping on the boat, little miss. We're only afraid of the dark. - Shut up, you moron! Let us out! Open this fucking treasure chest. [indistinct shouting] - Oh, gonna hit the fan, hit the fan. - Face it, loser. We're running this rodeo. Yee haw! Yee haw! Now let us out before I put you on a permanent time out. [indistinct shouting] - Oh the scratch shows his grizzled muzzle, and he threatens to cloak the world in darkness and forsake the glory and life of Lord Jesus Christ. That is why we must be strong. That is when me must stand and shout, Satan you get-- [loud splashing] - Turn that shit off! Bring me a bowl of mayonnaise. I'm sorry. - Now Ray Ray. - I need to be be hurt before you dine us. - Ray Ray, you don't mean that. You're just not yourself. Get back. Something evil got ahold of you. - Evil. - Ray Ray, you've gotta fight it. We're best friends, remember? - You can never stop our reign of terror. But sadly, you'll suffer the legendary. - [TV Preacher] Satan, you are cast out of this home. Cast out of this life. - Satan, get ye behind me! - Fuck you, skank! Your stepmother was right. You're nothing but a piece of garbage with a shitty ass hair cut. You'll never amount to anything. You're just a dried up old spinster who smells like rotten leather. You're a dive. - Why, you son of a bitch! [cross sizzling] [man shouting] [wind whooshing] [woman shouting] [man laughing] - Father Luke. - Father McGavin. I just made a pot. - Oh, no thank you. Um, I took your advice. And I went down to the archives. - Horribly dreary down there. - Father, I found this. Father, it's filled with pages and pages that corroborate the woman's story. It says that the evil toys are already here. I did some research. I went on the internet and I found underground videos of people saying the toys, they're basically being distributed to gullible folks that will nurture the toys. It says that when the time is right the toys will rise in an army to destroy mankind. - Sounds like horse shit. - Maybe. But father, what if it isn't? - Father. - Will you at least grant me the permission to look into it further? - Yes, but please keep in mind that most of the writings from that period are simply metaphors for mental illness - Father she, she seems so convinced. - She's bat shit. Sister Alicia believes that she saw the face of Jesus in her oatmeal. That doesn't make it true. We live in very troubled times, father. Plain and simple, the only demons that truly exist are the ones in our head. - Right. - I'll show you a grave if I bury you alive. Your evil toys will kill everyone that you love. - May the power of Christ compel you. - Fuck you! [pan clanging] - Teddy! - Hey, Sybil. Is Christy around? - Christy? - My girlfriend. I haven't seen her since we got back from Mexico. [woman screaming] [electricity zapping] Kind of got into it on the plane ride back. I figured she was giving me the cold shoulder, but it's been two weeks. I can't get ahold of her. - I haven't see her. She ain't been around here. - At all, I mean... Her car's still here. - Like I said, I have not seen her. I have a lot to do. If I see her, I'll tell her to call you. - If you see her-- [door slamming] [suspenseful music] [phone ringing] - What? - Sybil Lindon, it's Father McGavin. - I can't talk right now! My plate is very full. - I researched some of the things that you were trying to share with me. Sybil, I think there might actually be some truth to the claims that you were making. - Well goody for you. You're too late. - I need to meet with you as soon as possible, Sybil, please. I really think that the church needs to just have-- - It's too late. - But I really believe-- - I have a pissed off demon tied up in my living room right now, okay? I can't talk! - This is not gonna end well. [light airy music] - Ray Ray. - Hey, honey. You got any Ibuprofen? - Ray Ray, is it really you? - Yes, of course it's me. Who else would it be? - You're back to your normal self? - Nothing knocks the devil out of you like a frying pan to the head. - You ain't fooling me? - I'm right as rain. I'll swear on a stack of Bibles. Come on, got to end this craziness once and for all. - Okay. Ray. - I never wanna see another doll as long as I live. [gravel crunching] - You a friend of Miss Pittman? - No. My girlfriend's her roommate. Or was. - Was? - She's not returning my phone calls. - Private Detective Clink. Mind if I ask you a few questions? - Sure, um, I mean it's probably nothing. We went on vacation together, got into it on the plane ride back. I dropped her off here. I haven't heard from her since. Sybil says she hasn't been here. - Sybil said that? - Yeah. - Does your girlfriend have a habit of disappearing? - No. - I can help you find her. - All right. [bell tolling] [somber music] [dramatic music] [indistinct mumbling] - [Toy] We can't breathe in here. - What are we gonna do with them? - Maybe we can put the box in a fireplace and burn them. - They're gonna barbecue us. - Good idea. - Or better yet, we can sink them in the river. - No, daddy please! - [Male Toy] But honey likes-- - [Doll] No, I can't swim! - Maybe we'll just kill you instead! [doll laughing] - What, oh darn! Yee haw! - It's time I deliver the bad toys. The day of reckoning is upon us. Toys shall ravish the earth. Rivers of blood shall flood the streets. - Oh no, Sybil. [toys laughing] Now let's finish this loser up, daddy. Tie the bitch up so I can to medieval on her. - We shall feast from the skullcaps from the dammed. - Froggy hungry. - Rats! - Yee haw! [evil laughing] [dramatic music] [phone ringing] - Girlfriend Skipper. - Where are the dolls? - Way ahead of me, mister Chump. She is clearly got cold feet, so I'm taking matters into my own hands. - It's you that will be cold if you continue to fail. This is your last chance. - I got you, boo. Today is the day. I'm going to her house and not leaving until I have all three dolls. One way or another. [intensifying music] [doll laughing] - Feeling comfy, mommy? Now it's your turn for a time out. Your final time out. That'll drown off his wife. You're not evil. You're just stupid. Time for night night. - Drain her life force! [evil laughing] [doll laughing] [Sybil screaming] [chainsaw humming] [evil laughing] [Sybil screaming] - [Doll] Mommy got an ouchie. Should I kiss it and make it better? [evil laughing] [dog barking] [suspenseful music] - Protect me, Father, from the unknown evil I'm about to face. - Sign this. I'll submit a missing person report. I have a feeling there's more to this story than meets the eye. In the meantime, have you contacted her parents? - No, I never met them. Do you really think something happened? - The only thing I know for sure that Sybil Pitman is up to no good. Do you have any other information on your girlfriend that might help me locate her? - No, I mean, we could look in her car. Haven't moved since we got back, I have a spare key. - What about the house key? - Yeah, why? [upbeat rock music] - I want peanut butter banana sandwich. Hurry up and open the gates to toy hell. - [Male Toy] What is that spelling? - Toy hell, toy hell. - [Doll] Let's do this. Take it in to slow the bowl. - I'm not gonna break things. [indistinct chatter] [dramatic music] - [Doll] Let's start the shit up. - Calling every priest that is evil. [speaking in foreign language] - I need a rush. - [Toys] Huh? - Which one of you ordered the exorcist? [shouting] Retreat, demon! In the name of the Lord, Jesus Christ I pine you from excreting your thorn of evil. - No daddy. No, no! - Stand back, tiny demons. [doll shouting] All right, oh lordie now. - [Doll] Stranger danger. - Daddy sick. [loud hissing] - Lord, our God, make known the true life. No way but through us and repent this innocent face. - Real amateur The only reason why you became a priest is because you got to put tie on jeans. - What'd you say? [indistinct shouting] - What kind of death? - No, no don't listen to him. Just read! - Okay, use his Lord so that he-- [indistinct shouting] - See all hell, man. [doll whimpering] Father, return this innocent to patience. Hindrance impure. [man screaming] Carry the beast. [intensifying music] [growling] [wind whooshing] [indistinct shouting] [toy moaning] [man shouting] [man laughing] I did it! I did it! Oh tag my ass! [laughing] - Oh hey, honey. Sybil, come over here and help me up. - Oh, oh praise God! Praise Jesus. [toys shouting] [man shouting] - No, no, no! [toys laughing] [man screaming] - Now, time for night night. - Adios, mother fucker. [thudding] - David. - Well boys, if you want something down right, you gotta do it yourself. [toys laughing] Now let's go raise a little hell. - No! [evil laughing] [suspenseful music]
