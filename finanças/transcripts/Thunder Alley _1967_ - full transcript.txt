Hold it, out at turn number 3, smoke is pouring out of car number 24, driven by Clare moody. He's sliding in his own oil. Car number 21 starting to... Look, he's over the wall. His car has no place to go. Sliding down through the infield. Still trying to get a report on ed Stookey as soon as possible. We're under the yellow flag. All cars will fall in behind the pace car and hold their positions. Well, at the end of 124 laps, it's Jimmy John Jones, first, driving in the dodge. Holding down 2nd place in a Plymouth is Tommy Callahan... There's the green flag, and we're back to racing. So far, tire wear has not been a problem, but this race is far from over. All during this race, the pace has been terrific. Everyone after the big one. Watch it, the 63 car, sliding and ramming into the wall. Well, Callahan's still driving all-out to try and overtake the leader Jimmy John Jones. The speeds today have reached over 165 miles an hour. On the back straightaway, they've got Callahan boxed in. He's holding down 2nd place, and he wants that lead, moving down on the inside, out of the box and after the leader. Both of these drivers are flat out. Jack Mcfarland in the Ford. Callahan driving a smooth race up to now, seems to be having trouble handling. He's weaving back and forth on the track. Keep your eye on the 99 car. Well, here's the standing at the end of 325 miles, car number 26, Jimmy John Jones, the leader. Callahan charging down to the inside, pops the rear of car number 26, Jimmy John Jones. The car is in flames and hit by Manny brown in car number 17. The fire crews are rolling. It looks like a bad one from here. Rangey. ...all over the track. Bring him in. What? I said bring Callahan in. Ok. Ok, Mr. Reese. Bring him in. It looks like they're going to call the 99 car in. Yes, they're calling Callahan in. Here he comes, he got the signal and will be in on the next lap. Well, it's a tough break for Callahan, holding down that 2nd place all during the race, then taking over the lead on the crash of Jimmy John Jones. Here he comes, down on the apron and into the pits. Well, the feeling, up here in the tower, that maybe Callahan... Why the hell did you pull me in? I'm not due yet. You're overdue. You're out of the race. Pack it in. What are you talkin' about? Car number 6 on the south turn. That's the last time you'll pull that on a track that we operate. You're suspended. Pull what? Look, let's talk after I win this. Let's go! You heard what I said. Get out of this car and get off the track. ...on the track with Jimmy John Jones and the... All right, forget it, guys! Suppose you tell me now what it was I did. You've been building up to it in your last few races. Don't think we haven't been watching you. I should've pulled you out a long time ago for charging too hard. That's what it's about, Reese! No, it isn't. The ticket we give you isn't a license for murder. What murder? Jimmy John Jones. If you're looking for him, you're looking in the wrong direction. He's over there. As we come down into the final 100 miles... When did it happen? Will they hold till the end? You don't know what I'm talking about, do you? Pure accident. You weren't even close to him. Knock it off, Callahan. Hey, uh, those are some nice wheels you got there. Thanks. Mac Lunsford around? Yeah, yeah, he's in the office. Hey, Mac, somebody wants to talk to you. Now... Callahan! How are you? Callahan? Tommy Callahan. I want you to meet Annie Blaine. The pleasure's all mine, miss. Hello, Mac. Harry... oh, Callahan, I want you to meet Harry wise. Yeah, yeah, I know. Any of you guys want to meet Tommy Callahan? Forget it. Looks like the boys don't want to get their hands dirty. Take it easy, Harry. It's all right, Mac. Well, what's the matter, big man? Lose all your guts out there on the track? Hey, will you look at that? Now that's what I call wheels. A little different from that junk heap you owned when you first started driving. It's the same car as before, Mac. Hey, did he tell you I started him off in the business? He was nothing but a punk kid, but even then he had the makings. Why didn't you tell me you were comin'? How long are you staying? Stop it, Mac. You know why I'm here. Yeah, I can guess. I'm suspended as an independent. The only way I can drive is if some well-known promoter sponsors me for reinstatement and hires me to drive for him. And you fit the bill. Me? I'm just a small-time dirt track operator. I only run modifieds here. Look, the Nascar officials know you and trust you. And you run super stocks at Darlington. Besides, you're about the only one I know who'll give me a job. 2 things. Number 1: If I hire you, every one of my boys will quit. You saw them, they don't want any part of you. How would I bill it? A one-car race? And number 2, and what's more important: I saw what happened at Daytona. And it didn't come as any shock to me. I saw the same thing happen 3 years ago. Only I was too stupid to realize what it was. Tommy, there's something wrong with you. Sometimes you don't know what you're doing. I can't hire you. I'm afraid. Mac, that I'll kill somebody? No, that you'll kill yourself. Mac, what am I supposed to do? Get a job slingin' hash, tendin' bar? I'm a driver. So long, Mac. Hey, hey, Tommy. Let me buy you a drink or a steak, just for old time's sake. Well, there are other places. Mexico, Europe. You could get a ride. Yeah, in some backwater bootleg track. They won't let me drive in any bigtime, Annie. Just let me do my own thinking, will you? Don't crowd me, I don't like it. I was only trying to make you feel better. I'm sorry, honey. I didn't mean to jump down your throat. If I were your wife, I'd bean you with a rolling pin. But since I'm only your girl, I guess I'll have to put up with it. Would you care to try for a rolling pin? Not this year. Where are you going? To get a job. Rev 'em up and let 'em roll! Francie, I told you a million times, you need more speed on the down run. How'd you like to spend $10 and buy me a car that'll do it? All right, what's the excuse? Oh, shut up! Now what did I do? Fran, now, I tell you again, you need more speed on the down run. That has nothing to do with it. Oh, no? Then why did you land that car upside down? What do you think caused it? Come on, tell me your opinion. It's simple. The motor in that car is older than you are. You have to buy a new engine! When I want your opinion, I'll ask for it. In case you haven't heard, the principle of an internal-combustion engine is combustion. 4 of the cylinders on that clunker are missing and what's left are just knocking themselves silly! Oh, honey, baby, I love you. You're my only daughter. Now do you think I would jeopardize you? Believe me, baby, those cylinders are the perfect cylinders for that engine. And that engine is the perfect engine for that car. And that car is the perfect car for the stunt that you do. And besides, new engines cost money. Aha! That's the real reason: The money. Tell me, father dear, what's more important to you, the money or my life? Father, you have to think about it! Baby, I'm just teasing you. Is that the boss? Uh-huh. The one with the horn where his mouth should be. Why? Look it, this is high-class work, boy. This is not your chicken-racing down the street or driving with your buddies in papa's hand-me-down car. This... Hey, Leroy, give him a poem about that. That might straighten him out. Oh, yeah. "Them who learned in pappy's truck "and dreamed of winnin' fame, uh, then wanna drive to earn a buck" "should rather start in Spain!" "End up in tragedy and pain" Leroy, you're the funniest driver I ever met. Yes, you're a million laughs. I wanted to... look, uh, I don't want to interrupt you guys. Gentlemen? Uh, what's the boss's name? The boss is Pete Madsen. Did you ever drive before? Yeah. Don't he think he's somethin'? Now, honey, will you try just once more, and do it my way. For dear old dad? I told you, I'm not getting in that car until you buy me a new engine! But she don't need a new engine! All she needs is a longer head start. All she needs is a longer head start. Who are you? He has a point. He has a point? Beat it. She needs a longer run. Let her take off a second or 2 before the other car. They'll end up the same, and it'll look harder. Yeah. Yeah what? Who is he? It don't matter. He's right. Who are you? I'm lookin' for a job. Driving or talking? Driving. You've done any? Racing. Stockers. That's a lot different. You know, driving for thrills takes a real expert. I can handle a car. No matter what it's doing? No matter what it's doing. Look, if you really want to do that stunt don't use the rollover ramp. Let 'em go up the up ramp through the fire ring, hit nose down, and roll end over end. Hey, that's my daughter drivin' that car. You think I would jeopardize her? I'll show you. Ok, it's your neck. Set up one ramp. And never mind the fire ring, it costs money. Put 2 cars in front of the ramp and we'll see... I'm francie Madsen. Are you trying to put me out of a job? No, just trying to get one for myself. I'm Tommy Callahan. Can I borrow a skid lid? Sure. Over there. Thanks. Hey, Callahan, huh? Tommy? That's what he said. Hey, have you seen a guy with a... yes. Uh, over there, sugar. He wants to be a driver, doesn't he? He is a driver, honey. One of the best. Well, that's not too bad. About the job, it wouldn't pay much. How much? Let's talk about it later. Why don't you get a room in town, freshen up, and meet me at turk's bar and grill? I'll let you buy me dinner. You're very kind. You want the job, you buy the dinner, right? Incidentally, Callahan, although the prices may be a little higher, make sure you check into the Hastings motel. Why? I own it. Hey, uh. Hey, that was nice handlin'. Thanks. I'm Eddie sands. Are you the Tommy Callahan I'm thinkin' of, stock racing? Uh-huh. I sure am pleased to make your acquaintance. See you around. Take care of that for me, will you? Sure. You ready? Mmm-hmm. Hey, that was really terrific, what you did out there. Thanks. "Corn's in, moon's down time we hauled ourselves to town" all right. Oh, no. Wait a minute. Um, whose turn is it? Oh, mine. It's my turn. No, it's mine. Yeah, come on! Come on, come on. Come on, I want this. Eric won again. Don't do that on the track. All right, get $10. Come on. Get $10. Come on, get your beer. There you are. Where's the beer? Come on. Excuse me. Coming through, folks. Excuse me. Excuse me, clear the tracks. Thief! Hey, welcome. Welcome to turk's. Hey, I thought he left town. He has a right to stay where he wants, I guess. Oh, does he, now? Hey, hey, hey. Hey, uh, nobody told you you could hang around decent people, Callahan. Hey, Turk. You know who you just let in? He's the guy who killed old Jimmy John Jones. Didn't you, killer? I said, didn't you, killer? This is one of my customers, Harry. Now...now, you leave him be. Ah, leave him be? You're putting me on. Hey, does anybody here wanna let this man dirty up a nice, clean place like turk's? Are you drunk? The killer wants to know if I'm drunk. Well, I am sober, Mr. Callahan, so why don't you... You get him, Harry! Ok, ok, that's enough! As a matter of fact, that's more than enough. Sha-sha-shall I throw him out? Throw Callahan out? What are you, crazy? That's like throwin' away money. Now take it easy, kid. Come on, let's sit down and talk this over, huh? Sorry about all that mess. That's ok. A little fun with the boys, you know. Sure. Come on, come on. Now, Turk, you take good care of Callahan here. He's gonna be working for me. Everybody does. Beer all right for everybody? I'm buying. Yeah, that's fine. Scotch on the rocks. And I'll have... beer all around. This beef you had with Harry wise it was about killing Jimmy John Jones, wasn't it? Now you know, too. Does that make a difference? It only means you'll be working a little cheaper. Before good old dad gets into high finance and skins Callahan, let's dance and avoid the embarrassment. Callahan, if you have any gold fillings, hang onto them. Hey, Mac, hey, uh, what about the race? You going to let me drive in the next one? Eddie, you're ok in the set-up stunt, but races aren't rehearsed, they're just run. Oh, come on, Mac, just once. I just want to try it. You know, get the feel of it. Ok, I'll think it over. What could be so tough about racing? Pester him long enough and you might find out. You know, Annie's a pretty girl. Well, naturally. Are you going to get yourself one like that when you become a bigtime driver? Ha, bigtime? I just want to try it once. You're supposed to say that you want only me, not talk about driving. Oh, yeah. Hmm. I-I-I mean, uh... Hey, you're not sore, are you? No, of course not. Eddie, sometimes I think you should be dating an 8-cylinder engine. Honey. We're not going to stay in this one-horse town very long, are we? Huh, as long as we have to. But you said Mac turned you down. Why hang around? I think we should just keep moving. Somebody someplace will take a chance on you. Yeah, but I want Mac to take a chance on me. Some friend. Damn good friend, Annie. Don't knock him. He knows. About you blacking out? Yeah. No wonder he won't take a chance on you. Why did you tell him? I didn't have to tell him. He just knew. Well, I think it's dumb. I just don't see falling on your head and smashing up cars at a thrill circus as a career for you. No? No. You're the guy who moves them faster and trickier than anybody else. Around and around and around. Faster and faster and faster, until I want to holler or scream or something. Is that so? Yes, that's so. And then after the race, the parties and the laughs, every day just one big blast. I didn't even know you then. Well, you know me now. And that's the way I want it to be for us. Like it used to be for you. And all I offered you was a ride north. That'll teach me. Has it been so bad? Ok, bring Callahan's car in here. Good, now keep the track clear. Get those ramps out of the way. Morning. Hey, good morning, son. Why are the cars on the track? I thought you wanted a run-through. Oh, Eddie's doin' the nosedive. I got something bigger in mind for you. Francie, come on over here. I thought when we talked, I was being hired to do the nosedive. I told you, forget about it. I got something bigger and better all planned for you. I was up all night thinkin' about this. Now, here I got a star on my hands. Now a star is a star is a star. So I gotta use that star, right? Now, ain't nobody gonna pay their good money to see a star doing something that anybody could do. But everybody will pay good money to see something special that only a star can do. You follow me? No. See, that's what you're a star at. Look, you're not for turnin' them over. You're for pushing them around and around. Good morning. Hi, uh... Would you mind interpreting for me? Your father's spitting words like a busted fuel pump and I'm getting drowned in the gas. Well, we're staging a race. You're what? Every move is planned. I already spoke to Dom and Leroy about it. See, you start out behind, Dom and Leroy are in front of you. Now they got you blocked. You cut in on the inside, moving real fast. Francie's ahead of you. You pick up speed, trying to catch her. She blocks you out. You get mad. You make your move on the south turn. By now, you and francie have practically lapped Dom and Leroy, right. Now you're all bunched up. You're boxed in. Now, will you wait until you string out? No. Vroom! You'll make your move right now. As you go shooting through, you swipe francie, knocking her off the track, and you go on to win. How do you like it? I don't, Pete. Why not? That's the excitement the fans want to see. It's too dangerous for francie. That's how Jimmy John died. But he didn't know it was coming. I do. Sure, and she'll be ready for it. Hey, believe me, there ain't nobody spins out better than my francie. Hey, come on, kid, let's try it, huh? Come on, francie. Come on, Callahan. Harry, give him a start. Fran. Yeah? Nothing. You be careful. Hey, what's this? I spent all night dreaming it up. I'll bet. Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. I...I had to see Mac Lunsford. Hey, what the hell's goin' on? Are you all right? Damn it, answer me! Are you all right? Of course I'm all right! I told you I would be. I just didn't plan on a mud bath, that's all. You maniac, you could've killed her. Eddie! Stay out of this. Eddie, listen for a second, will you? It was planned. It was just an act, Eddie. Just an act. An act? Hey, punch me right here, will you? Nobody wins, babe, it's just a show. I know it's a show, but sometimes they could win. Oh, beautiful, beautiful. I never saw anything more exciting in my whole life. Yeah, except for the goof I pulled at the end. Goof, what goof? That's how it's going to end from now on. What? Sure. Francie gets a face full of mud and you get a mouthful of knuckles. You could fight back a little bit, to make it look good. It'll build up to a grudge-match race between you and Eddie. Come on, Pete. No, I'll be the Princess of Mudsville, and you two can fight over me. Now we could dress up that match race a little bit. You know, have a few crashes, some fires. Hey, what else do the fans come to see? It's ok with me, if it's ok with him. Well, looks like I'm outvoted. I want to get cleaned up. Hey, hey, hey. Wait a minute. Don't you want to see the new posters I'm having printed? You're my new star. What are you kiddin', Pete? I don't think that's funny. It's not supposed to be funny. It's supposed to sell tickets. Not out of my hide and reputation, you don't. Now look, you came to me for a job, right? So you're gonna be useful to me, right? Now, if you drive as killer Callahan, you're useful. You don't wanna be useful, you don't drive. Right? Right. I don't drive. Thanks for the almost-chance, Pete. I don't believe it. He quit. Isn't that too bad? Pete Madsen, expert Skinner and con artist stopped in his tracks by a proud man. Go ahead, francie. Have fun. But I'm gonna enjoy this, too. Honey, I found me a worthy opponent. You, uh, you building a house? No, a skyscraper. Oh. Beer. Huh, Pete, what can I offer him? Uh, girls? No, he brought his own. How about money? Yeah, money. How about it, Callahan? What if I give you some more money? Grab it, kid. It'll make history. I don't have a price. Sure you do. Turk, you know why Callahan is hanging around here? Don't you? Sure, he loves the climate, and he wants to drive for Mac. Really? Uh, Turk, uh, who owns Mac's operation? You do, oh great god of owning everything. You own it. You're putting me on. Uh-uh. I bought in last year. I happen to be the major stockholder and, uh, the not-so-silent partner. Poor Mac. Why? He's got a good deal. He does the work, I foot the bills, and we split the profit. So you see kid, I own something you want. I own your only chance to get back into racing. Now, you not only need Mac's ok, you need mine, too. Me? I can go either way. Vroom. Vroom. Hey, Callahan, why don't we make a deal, huh? You drive for me, and when Mac gets ready to go to Darlington with the team for the big 500, you get my vote. Come on, Callahan. What's it gonna hurt? Vroom, vroom. I'd like to tell you to go to hell, Pete, but I can't. You mean, we have a deal? Yeah, we have a deal. See you in the morning, killer. That kid's gonna really make Mac look good at Darlington. Darlington? He ain't gonna drive at darlington. But, Pete, you promised the kid you'd vote for him. I also voted for Barry Goldwater. Oh, hi, Eddie. Come on in. What's up, Eddie? Uh, well, I, uh, I heard that, uh, you were still with us. Yeah, I'll be around a while. Sit down, sit down. Well, uh, thanks. I, uh, I just finished talking with, uh, Mac Lunsford. Oh, yeah? How is Mac? Oh, he's fine. He says hello. Uh, beer, Eddie? Oh, no, thanks. I, uh, I've been after him to let me drive. Makes two of us, Eddie. I...I...I told him that, uh, you were training me. That so? Yeah. He...he was, uh, very impressed. Well, maybe if we have some time, I will. After you work out on the track a little bit, maybe I'll let you drive. What? Yeah, well, he...he, uh, he already thinks that I've worked out. I'm, uh, driving Sunday. You're what? Uh, Sunday. Eddie, you're gonna mess up that race. Not if you help me. Why should I? Would you believe I've got more guts than brains? All right. Faster this time, and get into your drift faster. Don't wait till you start to skid, or you'll spin out. Put it in the slot and pour it on. Let's go. I hope he'll be all right. I'd sure hate to see him make a fool of himself. Don't worry. He's got a good teacher. The best. Yeah, so I've heard. Listen to that noise. Howl, baby, howl! Hey. What? Do me a favor.

When you race at darlington, you gotta go first class to win. It costs too much. We'll lose. I'll pay it. So this is where the party is. Oh, Tommy, I...I wanna talk to you. I'll be inside. What's up, Mac? Tommy, I know I've been rough on you. But I wanna ask you to do me a favor. Name it, Mac. Remember that guy Harry wise the guy you belted in the mouth the first night you arrived? Uh-huh. He's gonna be in the race with Eddie tomorrow, and so are all his boys. They don't like you. I'm hip. I heard them talking. They're gonna take it out on Eddie. You gonna be in his pit? Yeah. Don't worry, Mac. I'll take care of him. Ok. Sure, it's great. What do you think? When I give a party, I give it big. Hey, hey, hey. Hi, where have you been? Oh, I stopped off at turk's to pick up some of the gang. They're gonna help me celebrate. Yeah, looks like you've been celebrating for hours. We have been. Hey, kid. Good luck to you. Hey! Go on, baby tomorrow, good luck. Boy, nothing like a victory party before it started, huh? It's the only one I'll have. Don't you wanna win? Oh, sure, I do. It's the only chance I'll have. Fat chance. Come on. All right. All right, boys. Wealth before beauty. All right, babe. Oh, do you know how to do this? Are you kidding? I still dip when I dance. Ok, Pete. You asked for it. Yes, I did. Didn't I? Hi, honey. Come on and dance with Annie. I'll have to warm up to it. Oh. Francie's helping serve. Why don't you give our hero a break? All right, Mr. Ancient. I will. Watch me make him blow a gasket. It'll do him good. Hey, man! I've got Callahan's girl! Right now, I'm Eddie's girl. Hey, how are you? Hey. Huh? Yeah. She's been around an awful lot. I expected Callahan would do better. Well, what are you, uh, uh, his mother or something? A special event for all of you fans here today: These are figure 8 cars. This is the slam-bang anything-goes race through the crossover. This is the big game of chicken. Don't be there when he's there. Pour on the gas and hope to hell you can stay there till the finish. Look out! Here it comes. Wow, how much closer can you get? Well, here's the finish. Car number 455 staggers in for the win. How about that one? Well, race fans, here's the one you've been waiting for: The 25-lap main event for the early-model stock cars. They're lined up and ready. There's the green flag, and here it is. Into the first turn we have a new driver, Eddie sands, driving for the first time in stock cars. Eddie came up from the Madsen thrill circus, a former stunt driver. Keep your eye on that 67 car. First time out, and anything can happen. In the first crack-up, 5 cars get slammed into the wall. Ok. Back here on the track. Eddie sands is really riding hard over these drivers. He's after that lead, and following right on his tail, Leroy Johnson. There's a car into the wall there at the south turn, and Eddie sands is heading for the pits to take advantage of that yellow flag. I don't know what those guys are trying to do out there. They just wanna hold me back, not win. Shut up and listen. What's he telling him? If I knew, I could be a champion driver. Get back into that box and hang tight. Fishtail a little to show them it's not easy to scare you. Yeah. The hell it isn't. You think you can do it? I'll do it. Ok. Get this baby out of here. Move it out. Move it out. Coming back out on to the track, Eddie sands. Well, there's the green flag, and we're back to racing. Look at Eddie sands going right on the bumper of the 78 car and pushing. Going into that south turn. Look at sands cutting way down low... Not yet! Not yet! This is one of the roughest and fastest races I've seen in a long time. Going into the back chute, sands around the outside... Right move at the wrong time. Pitman holds him off. Come on. Come on, Eddie! Come on! ...all the way around. Man, does this guy want to win. Look out, here at the north turn, car number 155 has lost it crashing into the wall. Harry wise holding down the 3rd place and starting to move. Sands is still driving like a wild man. They're on the south turn. They're making it into the final track with the first turn, spins... ...and takes that lead. Well it looks like a trophy there. That was a Callahan trick. I thought all you'd do was check him out. I didn't know you'd give him the fine points, too. I had to, Mac. You saw the box they had him in. He could've killed them. Look, Mac, I didn't tell him to bounce 'em out. Drivers. I don't know why we even make rules? All right, here he comes, pouring it on. Sands, still holding on. Sure of himself now. Out of that north turn, sands very cocky starting to lean on the 2nd-place car on Mickey's side. Hey, here in the main straightaway, 5 cars smashing up all over the racetrack. All right, sands now in the clear and going away. There's the white flag, and one more left to go. Let's follow him all the way around. Come on, Eddie. Come on. Here he comes, down on the north turn. Down to the checkered flag. The whole race has really been hairy. Eddie sands, a newcomer to racing, wins his first time out. Thanks a lot, fellas. You miss it all, don't you? Uh-huh. You're not a wild driver, Tommy. Why'd you lose your license? Don't do that. Do what? Turn off. It won't help me to cry about it. Well, it might do some good just to talk about it. Ok, doctor, I'll tell you all about it. Maybe you'll give me a little pill or some good advice or something how do you know I won't? Well, because you won't even know what I'm talkin' about. I blacked out. I blacked out, and I didn't even know what was happening, except when I came to, I was out in front and somebody got killed along the way. Just like that, you blacked out? It happened before, but never that bad. Oh, my... But you've been driving for years. Maybe that's it. It's bigger races, better and tougher competition. I guess the pressure got to me. What do you prescribe, doc? I don't know. I do. Let's have a coke. You won the race today. It was great, really great. The greatest thing I ever saw. Thank you. I'll be in the stands, waiting for you to win, Eddie. Just for you, baby. Just for you. Hey, Callahan, come on over here. Come on, I owe you a dinner. Sorry. I don't feel like drinking my dinner tonight. Aw, come on. Aren't you gonna help me celebrate my win? Didn't we do that last night? Yeah, but tonight's different. Tonight, I'm a winner. Come on, Tommy, let's live it up. Eddie, you better take it easy. You almost didn't finish. But I did everything you wanted me to do. I even got the flag. You had Leroy and Harry wise in real trouble. That's what I mean. I did what you wanted me to do. No. I wanted you to beat them, but not knock them out of the race. Nobody was hurt. No, not this time. In case you hadn't thought about it, the idea is to get around the track faster, not eliminate your competition. You know somethin'? I think it's getting under his skin that I was a winner, and he wasn't even driving. Eddie. Look, if you want to be a deadhead, you go right ahead and be one. Francie and I, we're going back to the bar so we can have a little fun over there. Would you like to drink to Eddie sands, the latest track monster I created? Ladies and gentlemen, Pete Madsen brings you his greatest and most exciting thrill show. Death-defying crashing cars and the spectacular slide for life. Down on the track, and ready to go for the slide for life, Leon blender along with his driver, pat Patterson. And here they go. Man, there's one guy that knows what it feels like to be on the hot seat! Ok, out of the south turn, coming down to crash through the wall head-on is les grifter. And now, the very spectacular rollover contest. And there's your winners. And now, the exciting and one of the hardest stunts to undertake, the wheel stand, and they will attempt to drive all the way around the track on 2 wheels. And the boys report to me that this is the only stunt where they get 50 percent less tire wear. Remember, there's no gimmicks, no shifting weights. This is driver's skill only. How about that? And your attention to the infield. The nosedive is under way. And here it is. The high-speed and perfectly timed crossover. And for our final event of the thrill show, the death-defying high-speed dive, the t-bow. Don't go away. Here's the one we've been waiting for, the grudge race between killer Callahan driving car number 14 and the new cocky driver Eddie sands in car number 44. Can you hear me, Eddie? Clear as a bell. How do I come across? Loud and clear. Let's get goin'. Here they come, onto the track, they're coming down. Here's the green flag, and we're under way. Heading for the south turn side by side, it's Eddie sands holding onto that low groove. Killer Callahan on the outside. Callahan takes the lead, sands doesn't like it. Ready, hero? Yeah, I'm ready. Ready for the first pass? Yeah. Here I come. Here's the pass, going around and spinning. And Eddie sands goes back into the lead. Well, race fans, we're seeing one here today. Sands learning his lesson very well. How was that, oh, great leader? Not bad, not bad at all. Boy, they really make it look good. Huh? With those transmitters going if anybody turns on a portable radio, they'll string you up. Only a little. ...killer Callahan, he's the old master when it comes to racing. I could drive this track with my eyes closed. Sure you can. Yeah, with my eyes closed and my radio off. I'll talk to you later, big daddy. Eddie? Eddie! Both these drivers pulling out all the stops. Are you out of your mind? We have to coordinate. Eddie! Sands, getting his first taste of speed, has gone overboard to try to teach the teacher. Callahan's steady. Sands using all of the track. It's Callahan back into the lead. Keep it up and I'll poke you in the eye. Oh, it wasn't what you thought. No? ...as they go into the backstretch, sands giving all he's got. Callahan's still right in there. All right. Out of the straight and into the north turn, Callahan has the outside. There's the long way around, and here comes sands. Look out there. He's going up and over. Upside down. The car is on its top end, burst into flames. Here comes the driver, Tommy Callahan. Out of the back of the car. That gas tank can go at any time. The flagmen are running over to take care of Callahan. Hey, it looks like he's ok. He's not here. I know. I wanted to see you. Drink? No, thanks. What did you want to see me about? Well, it's kind of hard to just come right out and say it. Try. Exactly how much does Callahan mean to you? I mean, is it temporary, or what? You've flipped for him, haven't you? Yes. I'm really sorry, Annie, because we've been friends, and I don't want to ruin that. I thought we could talk about it like 2 adults. That's damn nice of you. Oh, sure. You're new, and you're pretty cute. But you're not what he needs. I am. Annie... you've got a hell of a lot of guts, you know that? You've done nothing but make cow eyes at my boy ever since we got here. And the topper is that you...you come to talk to me like I'm some sort of a big sister. What do you want, my blessings? I'm sorry I bothered you. You didn't bother me, kid. We get track tramps wherever we go. But little girl, he's mine. And that's the way it's gonna stay. You're scared, aren't you? And I don't blame you, because I guess I'd be scared, too. I want him, Annie, and I have a feeling he wants me. He wants you? Huh, you've gotta be kidding. I'll tell you what he wants. It's out there on that track. He wants to race. Why, the only reason he went back to work for your old man was because he was promised another crack at it. Do you know what you are to Callahan? Insurance. That's right, insurance. He wants to make damn sure that if your father forgets, you'll be there to remind him. Pop never told me how he got Tommy back. Makes you feel like a damn fool, doesn't it? What the hell do you think you're doing? What does it look like I'm doing? And where did you come from? Now, come on, that's enough. Beat it, mister. I'm having myself a little ride. You're gonna have a ride, lady, in an ambulance. So what? It's my business, isn't it? Now get out of here, insurance man. Go away. Crazy broad. What's got into you? That's right, I'm a crazy broad. But you don't care, as long as Pete's my father. Your father? The guy who makes his daughter stand on her head. And a daughter who does it. You're both nuts. Oh, yeah? Well, I'd rather stand on my head in a car than on my feet in a kitchen doing dishes. And I'd like to see him try and stop me. And I'd like to see you try and stop me either, too. I'd kiss your silly-looking face, if you didn't smell like a brewery. You already told me that story. I tried to tell you that story. I tried. But you don't listen. I listen. You gonna listen? Listen. All right. The guy is on the outside, right? He gets thrown onto a grip. He has gotta get on top of the other car... on top of the other car, that's silly. Why would he wanna do that? Aren't you Tommy Callahan, the famous race driver? Hello, Annie. Sit down. Me, sit down with you? Oh, golly, wait until I tell the folks back home! Why didn't you pick me up at the motel? I thought I was your girl. Was I wrong? Not now, Annie. I got a lot of things to think about. Well, so do I. And we're gonna talk about it right now. Not a call, nothing. You just let me sit there. I'm sorry. No, you're not. Tommy, what's wrong with us? Ever since we got here, it's been like Dullsville. All I ever guaranteed you was a ride north. I didn't say I would provide fun and games all the time. If life is getting too dull for you, maybe you better find somebody else. All right, maybe I will. Hey, gang, need a 4th for hopscotch? Hi. Hi. You're too late. The kids couldn't stay off the track any longer. Not even to get your hot racing tips. You know, my brother and I built one of those once when we were kids out of scrap metal and an old outboard motor. Did it run? Sure, it ran. You have mustard on your mouth. Hmm. And then from go-karts, you went to racing cars? Correct. Here, spit. What about your brother? Does he still race? He died when he was a kid. Accident. I blacked out. You blacked out? The only thing is, I don't remember much about it. Well, I watched you pretty close the last couple of times and it only seems to happen when you get boxed in. Does that make any sense at all? No, no sense at all. Maybe we're wasting our time. Well, a lot of people would be very sad if anything happened to you. Oh, yeah? Name me one. Me. Thank you, Fran. Tommy, do me a favor. The next time it starts to happen, try hard to think about what's going on. Try extra hard. I do try. But I never remember afterwards. I feel like some kind of kook. Nicest kook I ever met. ♪ She'll be my world, my life, my love ♪ ♪ forevermore You booked to announce darlington? Right. If you're going down, come on up in the press box. You can see the race better from there. I don't plan to watch it. I plan to drive in it. Hey, look who's here. Eddie sands himself. What'll it be, Eddie? Daytona on white or the darlington special on whole wheat? No, thank you. Hey, Callahan. What're you doing this afternoon? Not much. Why? How'd you like to be my pit boss again? It's not exactly what I like to be known for. What's up? Uh, some of the guys at Mac's are getting up a race. You know, $100 a driver, winner takes all. That's an illegal race. Yeah, but Mac's not saying anything. Hmm, so long as the race is illegal, and I'm an illegal driver, no reason why I shouldn't be there, in a car. Let's drive a little, kid. You know, I got a feeling I just lost myself $100. Hey, I'm gonna see myself a race. And...and I got to mind the store. Hey, phone me. You guys are doing this against my wishes. If word of this leaks out, I'll swear you stole the keys to the track and Pete's cars by yourselves, which you practically did anyway. All right. You said it, now will you back off and let us race? Come on, let's get the money out. All right, here you go. Where's Eddie, huh? He's comin' now. Here's my $100, fellows. Why, sure, Mr. Callahan. Be the easiest dough I ever earned. Just give your money to old Mac here. Come on, guys, let's go. All right. Here, Mac. I don't recommend this for you. It's the only way I can try out for you, Mac, before you go to darlington. I already have Pete's ok. What Pete's ok? Didn't he tell you? He's agreed for me to go to darlington as one of your drivers. Pete didn't tell me anything. Where is he, Mac? In the booth. Well, you tell him to stay put. I wanna see him right after this. I wanna see him right now. Pete, I want to talk to you. Later. Later. All right, Turk, here it is. Coming down out of the turn, here they are. Down at the starter, this is gonna be a fast one and we're underway. Ok, no more bets down. They started. Going into the first turn, it's Leroy, right behind him, Eddie, then Callahan, then wise. Boy, Turk, is he moving. Yeah? Yay, Sandy. Go! Go, baby. Go, go! Go baby. Go, go, go. Go where? Go, baby, for Annie! Hey, Eddie tapped Burke in the turn and spun him out! Wise tapped Callahan and spun him out. Callahan's back on the track! He's trying to catch wise! And now, he's catchin' him! He's catchin' him! Go, baby. Go, go! Did you see it, pop? Did you see it? It's wise, then to Callahan, a-a-and it's neck and neck! Don't. Don't get boxed in. I don't know what happened. Turk, he's falling all the way back. All over the track. Tommy, please don't. Hey, wise is getting dirty. He's spun him out. That's Leroy. Man, that's mean. He's after that dough. With 2 laps to go, it's wise, it's Callahan... He spun wise off the track! Callahan wins! Oh, pop, he won! Isn't that wonderful? I thought you were rooting for Eddie. Well, I...I was... Well, go and congratulate him. Ok. Oh, pop, will you come with me? What have I got to celebrate? Hey, can I take it you have more than a mild interest in that boy? Callahan? What's not to love? Pete, you ready to talk now? Sure. What about? Did you talk to Callahan about driving at darlington? Me? Why would I talk about that? Don't fool with me, Pete. We know each other too long. I made no promises. All I said was maybe. That stinks, even for you, Pete. You said yourself he shouldn't drive. That was before. He's pretty good at the wheel now. Mac, we're businessmen. I make a bundle off of that kid. Pete, he drives at darlington. You're gonna let this break up our partnership? If that's the way you want it. But, Mac, without me, what are you gonna do for expense money? Where are you and the boys gonna eat? Where are you gonna sleep? Street corners don't make good bedrooms. If we have to sleep in cars and eat beans, he drives for me at darlington. What kind of person is that? You dumped me, Callahan? Wish I could say I did, Harry. It was your own mistake. But you all saw what he did. What I saw is gonna make me nervous driving with you around, Harry. Listen, I think you got off easy. If it was me, I would have killed you. Come on, come on, what's the matter with you guys? Well, it's him! Callahan, he's the one! Harry, you better pack your stuff and go, because these good old boys don't want no more. Well, you heard the man. We don't drive with you anymore. You did this to me, Callahan. No, Harry, you did it to yourself. Did you see me, baby? Did you see me take those guys? Oh, sure, Eddie. You were great, just great. Tommy, I just talked to Pete. You've been double-crossed. Where is he? Doesn't matter now. We just dissolved our partnership. It's up to me now who says yes or no. Tommy, you've been havin' any of your old trouble? Not lately. Can you guarantee it won't come back? Can anybody, Mac? No. All right, Tommy, you want in, you're in. That's all right. Look, I can put you in the race but after that, it's up to you. Thanks, Mac. Look, I've sunk every dime I have in those 3 new cars. Why don't you and I see if we can con an old friend out of his charger, huh? Let's. You certainly are talkative tonight, aren't you? Hmm? Well, good night, Eddie. You know, that was the quietest dinner I ever had. Well, there wasn't much to talk about. You'd have plenty to say if I was Callahan, wouldn't you? Eddie, don't act like a baby. Now maybe I ought to start acting like a grown man. When I want to kiss you, you kiss back, you hear? That was a little bit better. Hey, don't go in yet. Why don't you come over to my place, huh? Eddie, get out of here! Hey, what's the matter with you? How long do you think I can keep on playing kid games, huh? Now be a real woman. You wouldn't know a woman if you fell over one! Now get out of here! I guess you wouldn't fight so hard if I were Callahan, huh? You know, you're no different than any other track tramp. Francie? Yes, pop. Was that Eddie out there? Yeah. I've never known him to leave so early before. Did you have a fight? Kind of. Come here. Sit down. A blind man could tell what's going on. Yeah, I guess so. Now, how does Callahan feel about this? I don't know. We haven't really talked about it. Why not? I think he's got darlington on his mind. So what? Pop, you just don't understand. A girl doesn't move in when she doesn't know for sure she's wanted. Oh, I don't see why not. At least to find out. Maybe you don't want him enough. Oh, I do. I want him so much, I ache. Then go after him, Fran. Never mind what's done or isn't done. You go after him. Suppose he doesn't want me? I'll fire him. Pop? Yeah. What's your angle? Angle? Huh? What angle? What does it mean to you in dollars and cents? Dollars and cents? What are you talking about? Franie, I love you. What should this mean to me in dollars and cents? Well, you know how you are. Oh, baby, you don't even know your own father. Sure, I have a few angles ready to use. But that's my hobby, like some guys play golf, play cards. I play people. That's my fun. Fran, when your happiness is at stake, it's not fun anymore. Well, baby, you want Callahan, you go after Callahan. No angles. Nice homecomin', huh? Hey, who's the girl? Oh, miss somebody or another, for the race. You'd like to be up there, wouldn't you? Yeah. Put the cap on those plugs, will you? Can you crank or kick the pressure Gauge? Hi there, hero. That was quite a parade. Everything but the ticker tape. Yeah, I guess. You've gotta win this one, you know. You promised me a taste of the big time, remember? Yep, I remember. I'm gonna hold you to it. I got a feeling that if you get back on your way again, little old Annie gets dumped on the side of the road. I don't want that, Tommy. Annie, you always start somethin' when I need it the least, don't you? What did I do? Nothin', Annie, nothin'. Eddie, you gonna walk this race? I just wish it would get started. 500 miles is a long grind, Eddie. You better rest. Remember what I said? Yeah. Let Callahan get out front, and I hang back and block anybody else. Well, make sure you keep it in mind, or you won't drive for me a 2nd time. Eddie, don't blow any tires. Well, race fans, we're only moments away from the start of the darlington southern 500. Activity all through the morning over in the pits has been hustle-hustle. All right, the cars are coming out of the turn and heading for the starting line. Jack Boyer will set the pace in car number 4. All right, heading into turn number 1, Jack Boyer leads the way. 2nd place going to Roy horn. The 3rd spot to Bob Russo driving the entry from riverside. 500 tough, hard miles to go. Weeks of hard work, time, and money has gone into the cars in preparation for this race. Time spent on tire testing, proper handling of the car, many, many, hours spent on the drawing board, trying for more safety for these drivers, tuning the motors to a fine edge to get one more mile... Look out here! Watching in turn number 1 up on the high groove, the 81 car is starting to slide. He slides down across the track, down to the apron, blowing a tire. And the driver is ok. Ok, here's the rundown. Jack Boyer still holds the lead here in car number 4. The 2nd-place car, driven by Roy horn, has been drafting the leader for the last 10 laps. Bob Russo, held down in the 3rd spot, has started to slow down. From here, it looks like fire-trucking . This will mean a pit stop for the entry from riverside, California. Down in the straightaway, the 26 car loses it, sliding into the wall. Eddie sands, the former stunt driver, now running the grand national circuit holding down the 5th position and Tommy Callahan, who is in this race trying for reinstatement, has moved up to 4th spot. Well, the car above Russo went into the pits. Callahan is being watched very close by the officials today. Hold it! Bud Smith, clear out of the gates, slides up into the rail taking part of it with him. Leroy Johnson closing fast on Tom. Too fast! Too fast! There's no place to go! He's lost it, over the wall in a ball of flame. Leroy! And the car of dom, the number 36 car, is starting to slow down. This could be a pit stop. All cars will hold their positions. We're under the yellow light. Yes, the 36 car heading for the pits fast, very fast. Well, fans, this is one of the worst fires I've ever seen here at the southern 500. What the hell are you doing? Don't! It's just an act, isn't it? These drivers will do anything to help a friend. 2 deck members are holding him. He's going in after him. I'll get him out. Let me go! I'll get him! Hold on. Stop it. Nothing you can do. There's been no report on the condition of Johnson so far. We'll try and have it for you just as soon as possible. All right, the track is clear. There's the green, and we're back to racing. Well, with the crash of Johnson and dom into the pit, there's only 2 cars running for the Lunsford team: Eddie sands and Tommy Callahan. Hold it, into the turn, the 23 car in a long slide. Tommy Callahan driving the dodge, number 12. Still driving a great race right up to now. We've watched him very close all through this race and only twice have we noticed him weaving around on the track. Here it is again. This time a little more so. But still in very good condition. Still at the halfway Mark. There's still 250 miles to go. It's been a grand park race. Here's the standings. Boyer still leads by 4.5 seconds. This is over the 2nd-place, Tommy Callahan driving the dodge, number 12. It's been tough on the Lunsford crew, only 2 left running. Over in the back straightaway, the number 12 car is slowing down. This could be a pit stop for Callahan. Here he comes, into the pits. Here's where races are won or lost. This is the most valuable thing a driver can have. Tommy, what happened? Fran, I saw it. I saw the accident, my brother. It was my fault, Fran. I was the one who drove the go-kart that killed him. Oh, Tommy! Time out for handholding. He's always a winner, isn't he? He doesn't have to be, Eddie. Yeah. Yeah, why should he be? If you get boxed in, don't try to fight your way out. Stay in there. All right, come on. Come on. Let's go. Back on the track, with 325 miles completed. Boyer's slowing down for his pit stop. Here they come out of the pits, right together. Callahan in car number 12, sands in 43. Jack Boyer heading in for the pits. This puts Tommy Callahan into the lead. Eddie sands, in 2nd place, is running hard. It looks like he's after Callahan. A lot of action going on in the back... What is he, crazy? I told him to hold 2nd! Hey, here it is. Eddie sands has taken the lead from car number 12, Tommy Callahan. Car number 71 clear up on the wall sliding along, hooked to the rail, wood splinters flying as he drops back onto the track and stalls in the middle. Here comes sands. He's in trouble, up into the wall Eddie! Flips over onto the track and into the infield. I told him to do that. What a day we've had. Crashes all over the track and still 26 cars running. We've had long pit stops, short pit stops, and out of it all, more than half of the cars still running. Dodge and Plymouth have been the front-runners all during the day. Come on, Tommy. Come on. Well, as we come down to the last 2 laps of this race, the pace has been terrific. The Lunsford team losing 3 cars, the Harris team losing 2 cars. Come on, Tommy! Come on, you're almost there! Number 3. Here comes Callahan. And there's the checkered flag. Oh, pop, he won! Oh! Eddie. Oh, Eddie, I'm sorry. For what? What're you sorry for? I wasn't ready. It's all my fault. You'll be all right, Eddie. They'll fix you up. Yeah. Yeah, I'll be all right. I'll be ready next time. You'll see. Do you want me to go to the hospital with you? I'd like that. That's it, race fans, a great day of racing. You've seen the greatest, both with cars and drivers. Turning into victory Lane, Tommy Callahan the winner. And here comes Johnny Reb, carrying the traditional Dixie flag.
