I really don't like your family, Di! They don't understand the level that we're on. The level? What level is that, Fritz? The level of making the type of money we make selling this jewellery. See, that's why Lil' Leon stole from us! That's why he stole the diamonds! Because he was trying to get on our level. [Diana sighs] He did not steal from us because he wanted these stupid diamonds. He told me when I went to go visit him, that the only reason why he did take from us, is that... you didn't give him a job when he really needed one. Well, I don't trust none of the niggas in your family. And the next time, one of them come up here and take something from me, they gonna feel some of this hot steel in their hand like they do over in the Muslim countries! When you take something from somebody over there, they cut your hands off, no questions asked! But you know what? This is America, yes this is America! And Leon were lucky!

I have been writing though. It's a kind of positive aim. Lemme get my book. [prison announcement] Today I feel closed in, and very lonely. My mind feels like it's locked up in the cell, with no key to free it. Maybe if I had someone to talk to about how I'm feeling, it might be better.

I mean, his potato salad was freshly made, as the shine off the front of his face. You could tell he wanted somebody to taste that potato salad too. As Pimpie strolled in the yard, with his women, I told him don't bring the women but he brought the women anyway. Family was hating him. And as you all know, there's always haters in the family. I don't know why we hate on each other, but we do. Pimpie cried that day. I mean, he cried hard. He left the yard, in a hurry too. Only good thing, he left that potato salad. Now, I know this might sound crazy but, that was some of the best potato salad I ever tasted. I mean, Pimpie is a master of potato salad. I kinda felt bad but, somebody had to cry.
