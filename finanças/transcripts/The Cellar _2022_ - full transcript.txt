- Is this all of ours? - Yeah, it's all ours. Leave the door open. The others are right behind us. - They're always so slow! - Always slow. - Wow. - That's it? Wow? I told you it was only 20 minutes away. Yeah, by car, Mom. Do you ever try and see things from someone else's perspective? Holy shit! Yeah, it's pretty impressive! No. Holy shit! It's so ugly. Idiot! Mom! - The dust is back. - I'll get a vacuum. Steve, I wanna show you your room. Come on. A play room, cool! - And you set up all my games. - Just for you. I don't know why we have to keep all these creepy paintings and old stuff. Well, they came with the house. We'll probably get rid of most of it. Here, this will cheer you up. - Stevie, come on. - Coming! Yes! All our stuff! - Yay, belongings. - I thought you'd be pleased. - You know nothing about me, Mom. - Ellie. You might like this room. Follow me. Come on. You know, when I was a kid, I would have loved to have lived in a place like this. What's in there? That's the cellar. Why don't you check it out? It's filthy. I like to think of it as character. Yeah. Nothing to see here. Get me out! There's something wrong with the lock. - C'mon, it's not funny. - Hang on, Ellie. Dad, c'mon! - Mom? Mom, Dad, get me out! - OK, just wait. Calm down. Get me out! Brian, there's a key. Over there, there's a key. - C'mon! Mom! - We've got the key. - Just a minute. - Get me out! - Hang on. - Please, c'mon! Mom! Get me out! Get me out! - I'm done here. - Ellie. - I'm not staying in this house! - That's weird. You OK? Can I come in? Hm... Listen, I wanted to ask your opinion about something. What does this make you think of? Absolutely nothing. But do they look like they're having fun? They look like brainwashed sheep. C'mon, Mom, don't you have focus groups for this sort of thing? Well, I wanted your perspective. - I hate your job, Mom. - OK. Listen, I need you to watch Steven tonight. We have to go into the office, but we won't be late, I promise. So, you're leaving us here on our first night? Come on, Ellie. This one's a big deal. This one's important, OK? Fine. Thanks. Why did we have to move here, Mom? I'm doing this for you guys. - So that you have a better life. - No, you're not. You're doing it for yourself. - Where are your parents? - They're in work. You're kidding? You've just moved in. Yeah, they've an important pitch tomorrow. She says they need it to survive. I hope they go bust and we have to sell the house. Come on, Ellie. Maybe it won't be that bad. I don't know. I just miss everyone. I miss you. Why don't you come and hang out? I could come stay with you. - Yeah, why don't you? - Just a minute. - You OK? - It's nothing. Ellie? - Is everything OK? Ellie? - I'm gonna kill you. Ellie! This is Sophie, 19-year-old vlogger, influencer. She's living a jet-set lifestyle. Except she's not. She's an actress and we plan to present her as a real vlogger with a real-life narrative. Now, these are some of the initial ads which we will run on all social media platforms to support the video content. You changed the colour of her bracelet? Oh, we thought it was too... Change it back. - I can take it. - I got it. Ellie, what's up? Mom, Steven keeps messing. He won't stay in bed. - We're going in! - Put him on the phone. - Hello? - Steven, come on, behave. - Or you'll be sorry for a week. - OK. So, the target audience is pretty self-explanatory, - 16 to 19-year-olds. - What did I miss? Where did you get this? I found them in there. What the...? I've had it with this house. Morgan from my class told me the house was owned by a witch who made a pact with the devil. What? It's true! What's that? Delta... Point vector... Sum... Epsilon... Partial One equals... One N... DY by DX... One... Two... Three... Four... Five... Six... That's enough. - OK, bed. - Ugh! Naomi? Naomi? Hello? Naomi? This demographic, teenage girls, they respond well to aspirational marketing and social competition, so can we create a weekly vlogging chart where vloggers compete to receive the most likes? Who's the prettiest? Who gets the guy? - Natural selection. - Law of the jungle. No, we call the competition Natural Selection. Nice. Ellie! Mom, all the lights have gone out. Are the wall sockets out, too? - Yeah, I think so. - All right. We have to see if the power's cut or if we've blown a fuse, so I need you to go down and check the circuit breaker, see if any of the trip switches are down. I'm not going down to that cellar. I'm not kidding you. I'm leaving now. Ellie, can you just do this one thing for Steven, if not for me? What if he wakes up in the dark and no one's there? Fine. Listen, I'll stay on the line with you. - Mom? Mom, are you still there? - I'm here. I'm on the line. Are you OK? I can't see anything. I don't know if I can do this, Mom. I know you can do this. Mom, I'm scared. I'm sorry, I can't. You know what I do when I'm scared, to clear my mind? - I count. - Ah, no, not that, Mom. No, listen, there's ten steps to the bottom. You counted them? Would you just... Could you just trust me for once? - I'll try. - Good. Now, I want you to count each step, can you do that? - Yes. - OK, just listen to my voice and nothing else, just focus on the counting. Concentrate on that. One. Good. Next step. - Two. - OK, keep going. Three. You're doing well. That's great, OK? Four. Four. Four. It's OK, it's fine. Keep breathing. Concentrate. - Five. - You're halfway there. Six. Just four more. OK? Don't quit now. You're doing great, Ellie. Just keep counting. Seven. Eight. Good. Nine. One more. Ten. You're at the bottom. Can you see the pillar in front of you? Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen. Fourteen. Fifteen. Sixteen. Seventeen. Eighteen. Nineteen. Twenty. Twenty-one. Twenty-two. Twenty-three. Twenty-four. Twenty-five. Twenty-six. Twenty-seven. Twenty-eight. Twenty-nine. Thirty. Ellie? - Ellie? - Ellie! She's not here. What's going on? Ellie! Ellie! Ellie! Ellie! - I think she's run away again. - Right. She's done this before. Yeah, she'll turn up after a few days in a friend's house. Why don't you go inside and play? Hey, hey, hey, hey. She was right. About what? When she said I didn't know who she was any more. She's grown up and we haven't even noticed. No, she's still a little girl to me. There's no way she ran away. She was angry, you know, she's upset with us. You didn't hear her voice. Counting. Hello? Oh, I'm so sorry. I totally forgot. I'll be right there. I'm sorry, Steven. I completely forgot. Did Ellie come back? No. Not yet. We've talked to her friends. We've pulled CCTV from every bus and train station, but no leads, unfortunately. We've checked her social media history and there's a lot of harassment. Quite nasty bullying. Did she mention this to you? No. Well, don't worry, she gave as good as she got. She didn't run away. Why do you say that? Something happened in the cellar. I heard her voice, it was... She didn't sound right. Have you tracked her cell phone? Er... Her phone pinged off the Three Rock mast at 8.42pm. That was me. I... I talked to her. Can't you just please check the house again? Where I last talked to her in the cellar, for clues, anything. I can come up and take a look again, if you want. What about specialists? Forensics? It's not a criminal case. I'm really sorry. Steven? Come here. How was Ellie the night... the last night? The same as always. Is there anything that you forgot to tell us or anything strange? We played that. Go on. It's paint, plant-based so the chlorophyll shows up as red under the UV light. It's very old. It's been there since the '50s, maybe. Do you know anything about the house's history? No, no. We bought it at an auction. House and contents - got it for nothing. Couldn't really turn down that opportunity for the kids. I think, um... Might have been an elderly lady? Who needed to make a quick sale for nursing home costs? Well, the team haven't found anything else that would give us cause for concern. I'm afraid that's all we can do for tonight. I'll follow up with you in the morning. I promise you we're doing everything we can. Thanks. I'll show you out. Mom. God! Steven! - What's the matter? - I wet the bed. It's OK. Come on. Let's get you changed. OK. What happened to Ellie? I don't know, Steven. But whatever did happen to her, I promise you that we will do everything in our power to get her back, OK? - OK. - OK. Get some sleep. Hey, this is Ellie. I can't answer the phone right now, I guess I'm away, but I'll try and get back to you as soon as I can. Probably when I'm home. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen. Fourteen. Fifteen. Sixteen. Seventeen. Eighteen. Nineteen. Twenty. Twenty-one. Twenty-two. Twenty-three. Twenty-four. Twenty-five. Twenty-six. Twenty-seven. Twenty-eight. Twenty-nine. Thirty. Thirty-one. Thirty-two. Thirty-three. Thirty-four... Thirty-five. Thirty-six. Thirty-seven. Thirty-eight. Thirty-nine. Forty. - You been up all night? - I couldn't sleep. What is that? What does it mean? Have you thought about it? There's these symbols above all the doors. And they're different, but they're similar, right? And this... This is on the floor in the cellar. It's some kind of mathematical equation. We're going to get her back, K. We are. She was being bullied. On her social media. We didn't even notice. It's because of me they think she's a fraud. They don't agree with what she stands for just cos she's different, doesn't want to follow the pack. - I swear, those bitches... - I know, I know, hey. All we can do is we support her, OK? But it makes sense, why she ran away. It does. I just wish she could have talked to us. I feel so useless. I want to do something but I don't know what. She's definitely coming back. I'm going to have to go in today. Yeah, they loved the pitch. The last thing we need is the business going under and us losing everything. Rob Clayton. Rob, it's Keira Woods from the auction. You'll have to be a bit more specific, I'm afraid. - We bought the XAÁOS property. - Yes. What can I do for you? We're having some problems with the house. I wondered if you had any information on the previous owner. Not much. She's the daughter of a well-known academic who owned the house originally. Do you have a name or a contact? We only dealt with her solicitor, I'm afraid. - But leave it with me. - OK, thank you. Erica, I need a favour. - Shoot. - I sent you an email. Oh. Can you find out what font or language these are? - And what they mean? - Yeah, they look familiar. - Leave it with me. - Great. We're talking about target demographics, 16 to 19-year-olds with a focus on leaving cert students... Congratulations. We just loved your Natural Selection campaign. Thank you. We had a similar campaign go viral last year with the hashtag "follow your heart". A wonderful campaign. We really like the simplicity of the competition. Simplicity is key. I can't remember who said it, and I am paraphrasing, but... ..the receptivity of the great masses is very limited... Their intelligence is small but their power of forgetting is enormous. Nice. Excuse me. Hey, Keira. It's Hebrew, Hebrew glyphs, to be exact. So, they don't mean anything individually but when I put them in a certain order, they spell "leviathan"? Some sort of sea creature in Jewish mythology. Thanks. - Where's Dad? - He had to work late. What happened to your face? Let me see. Morgan said Ellie was dead, so I hit him and he hit me back. Delta... Point vector... Sum... Epsilon... Partial One equals... One N... DY by DX... One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Steven! - What are you doing? - Nothing. Why are you doing that? Counting? Was I? I thought you were playing your game. Y-yeah. OK. Mom! Steven. Steven? - Steven? - Mom, help! Steven. What are you doing in there? - Help, I'm stuck! - Just a second. I'm right here. Hang on a second. Wait. Steven? - Do you have the key? - No. - The lock is jammed. - It's dark, Mom, I'm scared. Hang on, I'm right here, just outside. Hang on. Steven. Steven! Who are you talking to? - Where were you? - I fell asleep in the playroom. - It's all right. OK. - What's happening? I thought I heard something. Shush. Don't move. Mom. Stay there. Mom! Steven! - Steven! - It's stuck. I can't get it open. Steven! Steven, try pulling on the door. I am! The key! What about the key? I can't reach it. I need to get a chair. Hurry up! Hurry up! That's it. Steven! Hurry! I still can't get it to work. One, two, three... - Steve, what's up? - Dad! Mom's stuck and I can't get her out. Brian. He's asleep, finally. What happened, K? The lights went out and I got stuck in the cellar. There was something in there. - Something? - Yeah, I heard something. It was in there with me. A presence. Take a look. I dropped my phone. It fell down the steps. It's not there any more. It disappeared. I'm sure your phone is still there. I also found out about the family that used to live here. The Fetherstons. They all went missing, all of them except their daughter. Missing, Brian. Just like Ellie. - What are you trying to tell me? - I don't know! I just know that our daughter is missing and something very wrong is happening in the place that she disappeared. I'm going to go look for your phone. OK? Come in. I'm sorry, I'm looking for Dr Fournet. - Who are you? - Keira Woods. - I made an appointment with... - What can I do for you? Um... Where did you get this? I bought John Fetherston's family home. It was engraved on the floor in the cellar. "Delta point vector sum epsilon partial I equals 1N DY by DX." Call me Remi, please. I haven't got used to this doctor thing. You see, I was in a car crash and a bang to the head changed the parts of my brain we don't usually use and... well, now I'm a bloody genius! How does that work? Before the accident I could barely add double numbers. But afterwards, I began to understand the language of mathematics. I began to see patterns in everything and somehow make sense of the universe. That's my magic trick. I'm able to visualise mathematical structures. That's pi, that's Hawking radiation and that's a quantum star. Who was he, Fetherston? Well... You're standing in his old office. He was a colleague of Erwin Schroödinger. - Nobel Prize winner - Cat in a box. - Yes, the cat. - Yeah, I never understood it. It's simply his way of illustrating the misrepresentation of having quantum particles existing in two states. The cat in the box is either dead or alive. We can't tell until we open the box to observe it. So, until we do so, the cat is both dead and alive. - I'm sorry, did I say something? - No, no. My daughter is missing, so... I'm very sorry to hear that. Please continue. Well, Schroödinger came to Ireland in the '40s to escape the Nazis and work on his unified field theory here. Fetherston worked closely with him until his son became ill and he disappeared from academic circles. Completely disappeared? I mean, does anyone know what happened to him? No. It's a mystery. He has a daughter, Rose, who you must have purchased the house from. I don't think she ever recovered. Never really spoke about what happened. I can't visualise this yet but at first glance, your problem, your equation is definitely a representation for a dimension. Or dimensions. There seems to be one variable that's interchangeable for each dimension. It's incredibly complex, like nothing I've ever seen before. Can you leave it with me and I'll come back to you? That would be great. Thank you. Hi. Hello, Keira Woods. Keira, it's Remi Fournet here. - Is everything OK? - Yes, why? I called you a few times and... Oh, you know, I lost my phone. I just managed to replace it now. That's strange. Someone answered. - What did they say? - It was counting. Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen. I wasn't sure if you were OK or what was going on. - Keira? - No, I'm OK. I wanted to let you know that I spoke to a colleague in France about your equation. He seems to think it's related to a branch of mathematics created by alchemists in the 12th century. He likened it to more of an incomplete sequence or an unfinished incantation. It's a very peculiar sequence and it does seem to refer to dimensions, but it's incomplete, as I said. Sorry I can't be more help. Well, thank you for looking into it for me. There is one other piece of information. My colleague has come across a similar one engraved in a house in Belgium. An infamous house, actually, where a family went missing, vanished into thin air. Keira? Keira? - Steve, I'm gonna talk to Mom. - OK. - Hey, are you good? - Yeah. I've emailed these to you. These are the engravings above the door. They're Hebrew. They mean "leviathan". Like I said, I don't know what these triangles represent but the letters, this is what they mean, look what it says. The abyss. Fetherston, the man who owned the place, called it XAÁOS, Greek for chaos, the void before time, the abyss. You're making huge leaps and connections between things that are completely unrelated. I could tell you that your name Keira in Greek means Dark Lord and you're connected to this. - That's ridiculous! - It also means dark-haired. You get my point? Look, the guy who owned this house was an obsessed academic. All of this, it's decorative. It doesn't mean anything. You know better than anyone that everything has a meaning. Every image, every word is doing something. These are pieces in a puzzle, can't you see that? So, what are you suggesting? What do all these symbols mean? I don't know yet. I've got to show you something. Look. You see? Each step is numbered, one to ten. What about this? Look. I met with a physics professor today. He thinks it's a formula to a different dimension. - Another place, Brian. - Keira. This is delusional thinking. The same equation was found in another home in Belgium, where another family went missing. This is our way to get her back, I know it. Please, Brian, I need your help. No. Brian! What are you doing? Stop! One... Two... Three... Ellie? Mom! Dad! Steven. - What? - There's something in there. It looks like Ellie. Ten... Ten... Ten... Ten... It's Ellie's. Hi, Keira. Rob Clayton here. I've tracked down Rose Fetherston. She's in a private nursing home called St Anthony's. I'll put you in touch with her carer, Ruth Collins. - Hi. Thank you for meeting. - Rose agreed to it. She's inside. She finds it peaceful here. - She doesn't speak much. - OK. Thank you. Hello, Rose. It's nice to meet you. I'm Keira. My family moved into your house. And now my daughter is missing. I came here to ask you about your father. And about the cellar. I know you've lost your family. I know what that's like. I've lost my daughter, so if there's something that you know, will you please, please tell me? Leviathan! Yes. One of the seven princes of hell. What is it? That isn't its name. Whose name? Rose, tell me. My father brought it into our world. Your father? He was a scientist. He was, until my brother Jack got sick and science couldn't help him. It's OK. Please take your time. Mathematics are supposed to make sense of the universe, to make order from chaos. But all he succeeded in doing was bringing darkness into the world. A darkness that has existed since before the universe began. Something ancient. Something that has been known... by many names. Where is my daughter? Is she still in the cellar? It's not just the cellar. It's the whole house! Hello, Keira... One... Two... Three... Hey. Look at this. These are the shapes from over the doors, OK? Five acute triangles. And a pentagon. OK, and there's more. Leviathan the sea serpent is misdirection. These are the Hebrew glyphs over the five points. Look. Baphomet. It's some sort of demon that the occultists and the Knights Templar worshipped. Some sort of gatekeeper or soldier in hell. - An ancient evil. - Look, look at the fingers. Just like in the painting. And there. Solve Coagula? This whole house has been designed around it. Schroödinger's cat. That's Ellie - neither dead nor alive until we find her. - Delta... Point vector... - What's that? Sum... Epsilon... Partial One equals... 1N... DY by DX... - One... - One. - Two. - Two. That's the mathematical equation on the cellar floor. I'm positive it's Fetherston. - He's reading it out loud. - But what does that mean? - I think it opens the box. - Seven... Eight... Nine... Ten... Eleven... Twelve... Steven! Steven? Brian. Check upstairs. Steven? He's gone. Forty-one... Forty-two... - Forty-three... Forty-four... - Shush. Forty-five... Forty-six... Do you hear that? Steven! Carry him, quickly. Take this off. He's so hot. Come on, Steven. You're OK. - What happened? - Nothing. You're safe now. - I'm thirsty. - I'll get him some water. Tell me, Steven. Did you see Ellie? I don't know. - I can't remember. - It's OK. I'm sorry. You're so hot. Here, let me take this off. What is it? Nothing. - I remember. - What do you remember? I rode the beast with seven heads and ten horns. Fifty... Forty-nine... - Forty-eight... - Brian! Forty-seven... Forty-six... Brian. Brian. Forty-three... Forty-two... Forty-one... Forty... Brian! Twenty... Nineteen... Eighteen... Stop it! Please, Brian. Come back to me. Ten... Nine... Eight... Seven... Six... Five... Four... Three... Two... One. It's here. Ellie! ..five billion, two million, seven hundred and two thousand and one... ..three million and twenty-two... three million and twenty-three... three million and twenty-four... Ellie. Ellie. Ellie! Ellie, it's Mom! Can you see me? Come on, Ellie. You don't have to count any more. It's OK. Come on. I got you. Come on. Come on, let's go. Come on. Come on, it's all right. You're not coming in! You're not taking my family! Brian. - You found Ellie! - Yes. Get Steven. Get Steven. Mom. I never stopped trying, Ellie. I never stopped looking for you. I know. - Ellie? - OK, we gotta go. C'mon, let's go. Let's go. - One... - Two... Three... Four... Five... Six... Seven... Eight... Nine... Ten... Nineteen... Twenty... Twenty-one... Twenty-two... Twenty-three... Twenty-four...
