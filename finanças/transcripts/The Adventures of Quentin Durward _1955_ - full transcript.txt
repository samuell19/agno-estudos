- Lord Crawford, his nephew Quentin Durward. - He awaits you. Wait Quentin, wait. There, now Quentin. - My uncle. - You may go. - I'm in debt to you, again. - Splendid, splendid. - Clergy clothes was to extravagant. - You astonish me, my uncle. Quentin, you were in tatters, would I allow my own nephew of my own noble plot... to go trailing to all the camps in Scotland... in a such an imitation of a poor proud church mouse. Doing so for many years now and it's no imitation. But that be up till now. Not as you're to carry my portrait to the most brilliant court in Europe. You like it? But there, there is a certain flattery. Exert, if there were not I'd broken that rascal neck. - What is all this about I going to Europe? - To France, you will go to Peronne. To the court of Charles the bold, Duke of Burgundy. You will deliver this portrait to our Scottish ambassador there. He will pass it on to a certain lady. - I am contemplating matrimony. - Matrimony? At your age sir? Oh, come, come Quentin, you know very well we Scotts are durable. - And who, who is this fortunate lady? - Isabelle, Countess of Marcroy. Now I can understand why you want to marry her. - Of course, she's rich. - Hey uncle, she's beautiful. That will be your first duty, after delivering my portrait to the ambassador... you will ascertain, does this portrait flattered the lady as much mine does me? Yes sir. You will then proceed to discover if she will make me a good wife. Is she modest, humble, chase? Sweet of nature? Gracious? Properly shy? In a word, is she economic? This is a bold question but why did she choose to marry you? - Politics, politics. - Well, you honor me with such a mission. Your no boy Quentin, distresses me to see you so poor. I find it very expensive, still you're a man of honor, an ornament to the family. I should be none of these things except for you. Well, now is your chance to repay me. - I trust you Quentin. - My uncle I swear, I shall uphold your name. I shall judge the lady character and find her... qualify I should proceed your mission with my life blood. Do not let us make to much of the qualifications, except... is her income regular? His Grace, the Duke of Burgundy. The Scottish ambassador is waiting. - Let him wait. - I can not. - You know my answer. - You know my necessities. You not give one single pig for you all necessities. I have mine... and I will not be sold like a prime cow to the highest bidder who appears in your bando. There would be no more incidents. My Scottish alliance rest on this marriage. I would rather you ally just with the moon and so need the stars. - Oh heavens, some antique Scottish heir... - His right arm rests on the Scottish throne. And his left on the graveyard wall. I am in no widowing condition your grace. - This is no my notion of marriage. - You are my ward and you will do as I say. I'm not peon, I have my castle, my towns and my lands and my own loyal subjects. All on the tended land of Burgundy. I'm neither helpless nor I'm stupid. And you not dare Your Grace to attend to force this upon me. I do not, there will be a banquet tonight for the Scottish ambassador. You will be there and your betrothal will be announce. - Your liege. - Your grace.. All there's well Lord Malcolm. Lord Malcolm, Quentin Durward sir, from Lord Crawford. His portrait. A miracle. My eyes are surely failing. Unless Crawford so youth since we last we meet, Your pardon sir, my renown kings-man is ageless in... - spirit, in valor, in generosity, in virt... - Come come Durward, we're Scotsman together. Besides he owes me money. A man is getting the bargain of the century and he wants it inspected. Oh, what could I do to representing some soft hearted race like the English. - What are your intentions? - To meet her. To judge will she make a bride worthy of my uncle's honored name. He'd be the luckiest man alive if he gets her. She's probably the wealthiest woman in Europe. - She's certainly one of the most beautiful. - When shall I see her? Tonight, there's a banquet in my honor and you shall come as my companion. I, by the way, I have need to go onto the shops. My uncle presumed that you will furnish me with funds... How taffy, your credentials are in order. Simple because you're in France Durward, I see no reason for preposterous extravagances. Keep in mind we are a poor nation. My Lord, my Lord, she's gone, gone, vanished. - She's gone, I tell you. - Get you to Marcroy, find her. - Did a couch just passed this stage? - Yes, on the route to Beauvais. Alrighty my Lady. My jewelry case. A jewelry box like a crate, just like a trunk. Oh, don't, don't just get a few, few Louis? A jewelry box like a create doesn't get a few Louis? - Animal, animal... - You, has a lady passed along this road? They passed yes, but they've sold to De la Marck. - Who is De la Marck? - Who is De la Marck? Who is De la Marck? I give an honorable house, animal, animal... Guard. What is this delay? There's confusion Your Ladyship, which road? The coachman is consulting a Tinker. - Across the bridge, to the left? - Thank you. Guards, guards... De la Marck, hold them. - How many are you? - How many you want? Hey, over here. Yeah, I'm 12 fingers bungler, I'm a disgrace to my uncle and my family and to Scotland. - She escapes De La Mark, she escapes me. - De La Marck? An ugly dragon, he tried to kidnap her in Ashby, I had to prevent it. Used to know De La Marck. Durward William De La Marck is the terror of Flanders. A renegade count, he haunts the woods with a 1000 followers. They call him the beast of the Ardennes. - When did this happen? - What I know? In the dark. - But on what road? - To Beauvais I think, whatever that is. The Duke sent his men to Marcroy but she did not go home. - Beauvais is not on the road to Marcroy. - Where did she go? You came here to meet your king man's bride, you may up end encountering history. Have your wits Durward or are you merely brave? - You doubt my honor sir. - Discouraging my son. You may have to match your wits against King Louis, who has no honor. He despises your code of chivalry, his ruthless, unscrupulous... he has one loyalty, to France. With one gift, he's a genius. - What I've to do with Louis? I've taken the thing she's on her way toward... to put herself under the protection of the king. - I'm on my way. - Gently while out there. If Burgundy discovers that she's gone over to Louis, that could be war. And a wasting civil war in France is not in Scotland interests... I go in secret, place myself to Louis court, make her acquaintance, gain her confidence... Durward... you are a handsome, proud, gallant, honorable... and slightly obsolete trigger. I say it in admiration and old nostalgia. The lances have been put away, beyond by the sits where the judges were. History is creating a new subtle world... cruel, political, thoughtful, violent. And Louis it's symbol. If you are to match him my Scottish cavalier, you may have... put strain your more glorious impulses. You trust me? Hey, you'd be needing funds, I presume. What a welcome to a stranger? Remove these weed, it tickles. What is your business here? I am a wandering Scotsman with a sword at His Majesty's disposal. - Do we test it? - We rather test your purse. In my honor is my purse. A terrible thing is happen. There's may be time, we may save him, we're helpless. You tie loose knot hangman, we had to finish your work. - You tied the knot. - I did not tie, may heaven bear me witness. Old time should this is heaven look down. And a bird that hover above us. - Villager, you cut this robe? - I'm a stranger., I committed an act of mercy, I demand to be taken to His Majesty. Cut that foolish dagger and come down here or we so blasted to pieces. Pax vobiscum, we come to present you with the joys of the next life. I enjoy this one, get out. Well, if you take such pleasure and purse is of such weight... perhaps we could come to some arrangement. A Scotsman sir, of honorable birth. And before I stood to buying my life, observe how I should sell it. A true Scot, much blood, much pride, no doubt about, courtesy a lackage. By all the same this is to much. Am I to be shot at by robes, hung by thieves and insulted by lackeys? If your a gentleman go back to your king... tell him that an honest Scotsman offers an honest sword. But the thieves weren't verse and bribes... seekers than the guardian safe trust and your Louis is no genius. He's a baby in swaddling clothes or a drooling doolally old man. Thank you Scotsman, I'm Louis. Guard, release him. If he still in the area by night, for of course you can way with him. Your Majesty, I'm the baby in swaddling clothes. What is your name? Durward sire, Quentin Durward, at your service. Not at my service, I enjoy an honest man, I... trust no man I can not purchase, begone or hang. Don't, very foolish, why must you be so brave? - Who are you? - The gypsy, Hayraddin. It was my brother you tried to save, I'm beholder of you. Oh, you were so brave, you make me uneasy, don't do it. Dear sir, I tell you, there is no castle in Europe so guarded. I'm a spy, it is my business I know. - You spy for Burgundy? - No, Louis. My brother is for Burgundy. Oh, sometimes I'm for Burgundy and my brother was for Louis but today... he was for Burgundy and, to bad. Listen to me, has a great lady come to this castle? Of course, the Countess of Marcroy. - I'm a spy, I know everything. - Is she in the castle now? Of course, that's way they hang my brother, because he finds out. - Did he send a message to Burgundy? - Of course, he is a spy, it's his business. He was such a good spy, he was the best in our the family. Next to me. Sir, a crazy man, I can not let you. Oh, why am I so beholding to a man so brave when I'm such a coward? - It is embarrassing. - Tell me gypsy, you know this castle? Of course, like the palm of your hand. He's sleep, good night. Your Majesty? Your Majesty. It's easy a very easy thing You Majesty to laugh... at a man of old fashioned honor and dismiss him. And place your faith in gunpowder and men you can buy. But this is an honest dagger at your throat and where are your guards? It's my opinion sire that you need me but you're not so convinced. - Would you care for a drink? - If you please Your Majesty. A little long, perhaps. Oh maiden, what a pity it is the good old days of chivalry would never come back. What excitement we laid in joust home, what magnificent slaughter was stage in our honor. Consider my grand-mama of blessed memory, when my grandfather won her favors... such a tournament was held, why, it cost the lives of two, the fracture of one backbone, one collarbone, three legs... two arms but my grandfather prevailed. Splendid and I sure resulted in a most unhappy marriage... And your grandfather beat your grandmother real merciless. Such splendid times indeed, I beg your pardon. Ladies, a thousand pardons I, I took the wrong door. - Lady Hameline, who, who was that? - I haven't the slightest notion. My... Dreadful experience Your Majesty, dreadful, I trust my hand steady today. - Is not. - I'm not surprised. Oh, what a monster? Even 7 foot tall Your Majesty. Arms like a forest duck, fist like a sledge, he brought it down... Such a ruffian, the moment I regain conscience, I reported... the incident to the guards, most mysterious, they had noticed anything unusual. Most mysterious. I had no doubts Your Majesty, it was some vengeful, small minded person... jealous of the complete confidence you place in me. I had my enemies sire, but what a detestably fella. - You send for me sire? - Excellent Durward, wait for me. Sire sire, he's the one. I find I'm developing considerable affection for men of daring results... but occupy less the imagination, qualities I seldom find around me. Get on with the shaving. Can it be Burgundy itself? Isn't it frighten? Isn't it exciting? I leave you Lady Isabelle. The Count de Creville, ambassador extraordinary His Highness Duke of Burgundy. Stands in the court yard and demands audience with Your Majesty. Demands? The Burgundian demands? Dunois, sign my fielder marshal... order him to mount a guard of honor in the courtyard immediately. - Have we pride Your Majesty? - I can answer you Dunois. Speaking for myself, I have none. There is an apartment to which my barber will now take you. In the apartment is a lady, her identity not concern you. She's not to leave the apartment until I personally bring you word. Keep her away from the window where she may be seen. And before anybody except myself enter the apartment, you will be kind enough to die. She is very beautiful, remember that you are a man of honor. Your Majesty. What is this? Quentin Durward, Your Ladyship, at your service. May I suggest that you found the wrong door again. His Majesty's instructions. - May I suggest I'm capable of screaming. - His majesty forbid it. Help, guards Lady Hameline, guar... Thousand pardons Your Ladyship, you... your not to leave nor reveal your presence until, I presume, the Burgundian are gone. Until the king himself releases us. I've observed De Creville, he wears a full armor, another insolence. We are prepare to receive the envoy from our cousin. A calculated insult. My credentials Your Majesty, from my lord, Duke of Burgundy. We do not need your credentials Phillippe de Creville. We pray that your elm is as more peaceful than your breath. That will be seen, my sovereign lord made certain demands. First, that you cease your secrets and underhand dealings... with the revolutionary movements in the Burgundian towns of Ghent and Liege. I know of no such dealings. Second, that you return immediately to our sovereign liege... - Isabelle, Countess of Marcroy. - Isabelle? I've heard of her, beautiful woman. You are sheltering her in this castle at this moment. - That is a lie. - You lie. - Your evidence? - A witness, Zamet, the gypsy. Where is he? Let him testify. You know that he can not testify, he's dead, hanged by your police. Whose word then is France to take? That of his king or a dead gypsy? I can not speak for all of France. - But Burgundy will choose the gypsy. - De Creville? - You address your king, - Not I. How come? How come? Louis of Valois, King of France, I Phillip de Creville... in the name of my lord and prince, Charles, Duke of Burgundy... give you openly to know that he my lord renounces all allegiances... to your throne and your dignity, proclaims you false... and defies you as a prince and as a man. - There's lies my Gage. - Dunois, let it lay. The years are few Dunois... since your father fought beside the gallant maiden of Orleans Joanne of Arc. And saw her taken by Burgundy, by your lord's father and sold. Sold to the English throne, France will never doubt your loyalty to France. The years are even fewer De Creville since my father... drove the English from the body of France. And we stood at last, a free, whole nation. Would take god that I may take that silly glove... and throw it to your angry pompous face. But I will not, you elect for war. A bloody senseless war, that divides and wastes, send bankrupt farms... and bring the English flooding back upon us, I elect the peace. And I will lie and cheat and steal, except in sound of dishonor... but by all the saints I shall prevail. I shall not see France dismember. De Creville, pick up your Gage. Bloodless monarch, let it lay there forever. A small monument to cowards. De Creville... Lord Cardinal... it is your holy duty to make peace among princess, pick up the Gage. De creville, if in 30 days time your lord belligerence is not a memory... then I will come to Peronne, to his court, myself alone, to negotiate our differences. Majesty, I beg of you. - You will come alone? - Alone, with a small guard of honor. Check and mate. Ah, I have you. - I should've some way out. - Mate, I tell you, try to escape me.. That will be five ducats. - Did we say five? - Five ducats. Of course, I never carry my purse on duty, I shall have to owe it to you. Quentin Durward, you can not be an Englishman, not in Louis court. - I'm a Scotsman. - There goes my five ducats. There, you have me. I suddenly see before me my favorite uncle. Good, tell me about your favorite uncle. Well, tell me, does he owe your five ducats? He is a paragon of magnanimous, of value, of virtue of generosity. Oh, really? Quentin Durward, you're a strange one. - I apologize. - Oh no, I like you. I've been living a most lonely life Quentin. Kind of life any woman should live. As a measure of my loneliness, I suppose I'm grateful for this disturbance stand still. Has imprisoned me for the afternoon this Scotsman given to sit and starts... ups and downs, burst of exuberance and think to himself. Who beseech a favorite uncle of the most lamentable description, who owes me money. Who? Oh, in short I find absolute intriguing. - Now you making fun of me. - No. There you go and I've done it again. Well, then it's your turn, say what you think of me? Do I should be brave about it? You're probably the most beautiful and extraordinary woman I've ever met. Something is going on below. It's simple suicide your Majesty. I'm an admirer of courage but this is midsummer madness. If you go to Burgundy alone, he'll kidnap you, imprisoned you, hold you hostage... - and France will be at his mercy. - Thank you Dunois. Consult your barber, is there anyone else whose advise you trust? I don't know about his advice but if there lives a man a king must trust. Is the one held a knife gaily at his throat. Is it about your promise Your Majesty? Oh, it was a magnificent promise. I was listening in the gallery, such racionism... and from you too sire, I almost died from shock. I haven't the smallest intention of going Peronne, either alone or otherwise. But it was such a public promise your Majesty. Wining on history demand kind indent and more comfortable headgear. I said that in 30 days Burgundy was still belligerent, he will not be. We're going to commit a private disarmament master Oliver, not as puppy. - Oh, I'm relieve Your Majesty. - What is our liaison with William De la Mark? De La Mark, why, the gypsies. If De La Marck had lands, a subject people and strong held on Burgundy's flank. We should had far less of our cousin belligerence. Has he hopes for such lands, he's an outlaw, lives in the woods. He has more than help, send for Hayraddin. Let him come here at midnight for instructions, he'll need an excellent horse. We're about to involve in a foul venture Master. Oliver.- Foul and necessary, fit only for gypsies. What are you Durward? Why you so far from Scotland in France in Louis court? - Too long a story. - Please tell me, I want to know. You haven't explained me who you are or why you are here. Oh, that's a lady's privilege. Please... Oh, I have been described as slightly obsolete figure. I was raised for the knighthood, I was trained to... the lance and the bow and the sword. I was taught to be proud, to praise God, to defend the weak, to respect womanhood. Be loyal to my family and to be true to my word above all things. There's no need for candles now, is there? As to what I am Countess Isabella, it's about all, I was born perhaps a few minutes too late. - That's why I'm here. - How do you know my name? His Majesty. - Thank you Durward, - Your Majesty. - Your Ladyship. - Oh, you must come back. Don't forget you owe me money. It is so long since I've seen man less than a 1000 years old that come susceptible. - Why did you tell him who I am? - I didn't, won't you sit down? He men not learned from me... your presence here can hardly be regarded as a state secret. Let us say quicker my lady, you will have to leave. Oh, no. Not for the moment but in a very few days, I have denied your presence here at the most enormous risk. I have lied to Burgundy's envoys under the most public circumstances. Is the King of France incapable of defending me? Yes, without war but you have me go to war to save you from an unsympathetic marriage? No, of course I would not have you go to war for me. If it is in France's interest I would fight for you... or I return you instantly to Burgundy if that was right for France but it is not. You strategic lands, you stronghold at Marcroy... you may not enjoy the role countess but the man who captures your affections... Holds the balance of power in France. I'm not surrendering that prize for my cousin disposal. Your been honest Your Majesty and I thank you. - But you can not stay here. - I should be at the archbishop of Liege. Liege? It's a Burgundian town, The bishop is of the Burgundy's family. He's my godfather, he's a saint man and he has the power of the church. I spent many weeks there as a small girl in his castle. He loves me and I don't think he'll forbid me sanctuary. If that is your choice. Liege, that's beyond Peronne. I shall arrange a route for you to the south, which avoids Peronne. Let us say through the forest of the Ardennes. - I should do everything I can for you. - Thank you. I will furnished you with a body guard, the detail won't be large as to detach attention. Then that is settled. - It is a long and perilous journey. - I grow accustomed to peril. Whatever the outcome my dear, forgive me, France. I understand. The gypsy sir, shall I bring him in. I can have nothing whatever to do with this you will instruct the gypsy, - That is for De La Marck. - Oh dear me. - That's for the gypsy. - Do you so trust him sir? If he's paid sufficiently. He's to find De La Marck. Tell him that on certain day, the countess Isabelle Marcroy will be... passing with a very small guard... there is her route and the places she'll lodge on her way, she's his for the taking. - Hold up whole Lady. - Yes. Let him tell the De La Marck that I shall make every official... protest against this most shocking outrage. He will understand my position and disregard my protest. Yes sire. Let him warm De La Mark, that the guards I assigned to the Lady... had instructions to defend her to the death. Must be no evidence that I or my men had failed to their duty, it's a small party. - Won't give him any trouble. - Isn't this rude You Majesty? Talk to Hayraddin that I will held back the Countess departure... until he had time to find De La Marck. He will then return to the point mark on the route, meet the party... and act as it's guide for the remain of the journey.- You think of everything Your Majesty. Whose direct our guards sire? He must be incorruptible, that's a problem in this court. He must die, there are few so brave. I assure you I've thought of exactly everything. - I hope it's not me. - Die? Not this time, I'm sending the man she loves. It turns skeptic, now you satisfied? - Feeling god sire, does he love her? - I don't know. - He will by the time they reach the Ardennes. - Oh, Your Majesty is really are a genius. Louis. You will not depart from the assigned route. You may trust the proprietors of the various lodgings. A man will meet you and act as your guide beyond the river Seine. I have done everything in my power for the safety of your passenger. - Sure you have Your Majesty. - You'll do everything in yours. You were right Durward, a king can use anyone, even a man of honor. Who else could I trust to die in performance of duty? I shall sire, if necessary. - Who is the passenger? - Your Ladyship. You should've travel out, the rain stop. This is your escort, truly the best I have. - Good morning. - Good morning. Thank you Your Majesty. - Well, good luck Durward. - Thank you sire. And good bye. Away. It's been a lovely day for me Mr. Cavalier, I can knew days... when ladies had chances to ride and to know that you ride at her side. Know that I'm protected for once for something more than my own determination. You wouldn't be aware but this is not the first time I travel behind your coach. And how so it? I don't understand. Under what circumstances? In a dream. - How nice you put it. - Thank you Your Ladyship. How hungry you were. Durward, are you acquainted with Lord Crawford? Sorry, who? But since you're both Scotsman, I thought, Lord Crawford? - Oh but I have met him. - How's he like? Oh, a paragon of virtue, generosity, sensibility, the noblest of man... And approximately the oldest, only you can any scotch, how you bend together. This ain't come as a surprised you but... if it were not for this fellow countryman of yours... you and I would not be scrambling over the face of France together.- Interesting. My lord, the Duke of Burgundy try to force me to marry him. Am I absurd to believe that my heart and my soul are my own? To be dispose over I choose. And just because I'm a woman, am I just so much property of such and such a value? - Is it foolish? - Oh I, it's... Oh, I know, it's all too intimate. On decide such this things are one own heart. Well I choose that I fled. And still I'm fleeing, sometimes I... I awake at night and wonder how great a fool am I. Should I surrender? Return to Peronne, deny my soul, accept my fate? And give myself to this creaking antiquity? More wine? I can not in honor speak against a Scotsman. He is, he's not that bad, his not bad at all. Not that young is true but thin. But full of wisdom and experience, he'd make an excellent husband. Durward, are you by the slight chance Burgundy's employed? - No, by all this... - How did you know my name that afternoon? - His Majesty... - He did no tell you, I required. What you doing in France? You've never tell me. And I can not tell you now, I have perhaps sworn to many oaths in my time. My life grows complicated. The last I swore was to Louis, that I would delivered you safely to Liege... this I shall do. They've given me the next room. Any disturbance during the night, cry out I'll hear you. Good night Your Ladyship. - I'm alright, what happened? - I do not know yet. Durward, Durward. Hayraddin. - My spying friend, are you the guide? - Sounded crazy man, are you the escort? - Oh why not? I'd make an excellent escort. - Oh, I'm certain, is just you're so brave. The size of you frightens me. Oh, I didn't know it would be you. I didn't know it would be you and I'm delighted, it bring me good luck. - Right now I need it. - Oh, oh? It will take 2 hours for a temporally repair. A couple of hours? We'll be late getting to our lodging. Go elsewhere, the Inn a dreadful place, I have been there. I know a camp, my people, a brother. You will be welcome, music, dancing. - The ladies. - Sir I'm beholding to you, I advise you. The Inn, a frightful place, bad food, un-clean, bed like feckless-es. But I have such definitive instructions from His Majesty. Your Ladyship... - Isabelle? - Don't touch me, I don't trust you. I love you. It's useless to love you, I can not explain. If I explain, you trust me even less and run away more. But this is insane, how far con you go without me? You need me until you're safe at Liege. Then, if you insist I'll explain. Quentin... Your room is prepared madame. First room on the floor above madame. - We have to get a blacksmith. - Can you find a blacksmith? They got no stake here, my brother's camp is not to far away. The couch can move, they'll have to work all night. Can you find a blacksmith and several strong men? Easily too easily. Sir, leave the lady here, you and I will... - Oh, why do you have to be so honorable? - Why you have to be so dishonorable? - Because I am a gypsy, is expected of me. - Find a blacksmith. I beg you, I beg you, I would go down to my knees but it's too conspicuous/. - Spare him. - My orders are different. I brought the orders myself from His Majesty. Take the lady, spare the escort, sign Louis. That what he said. - Take the gypsy, that what he said. - Take the... I thought you were that postman. If there is noise during the night, they're repairing the coach, I hope you undisturbed. I'm frightened, that postman, the man down stairs, the landlord... Where would you be? The Inn is full, they put me about the stables. No, Quentin... Stay here. The Inn was the King's own choice, there should be no trouble, good night. - What is honor? - You get out of here. - Oh, yes sir, I need advice. - I need sleep. But what is honor? What is dishonor? Oh it's really difficult. No, no, if I say, I here am a gypsy, I want to be honorable. - But what shall I do honorable too? - You drink too much. I drink for the first time in my life, I have good reasons. We sir, I have such decisions to make. You, you have honor to be honorable, but what shall a gypsy be honorable too. I have no honor. - Money? - You're disgraceful. When Burgundy pays me money, I am honorable to Burgundy. When Louis pays me money, I am honorable to Louis. But this is dreadful. It's worse than dreadful, it's such talk I've never heard. The most heverish lying, cheating, disreputable... So, I'm a thief, I am a hever, I am disreputable... - Will you leave me to sleep? - Oh, I have it, I have it. I shall return the money. Sir, they about to murder you. Well, I feel much better. Sir. Charge, charge... Coachman, get to the lady. Hayraddin, Hayraddin... - Help him. - Impossible, I'm a coward. Hurry. Help him, you poor man. What do you expect of the son of a horse thief? Hurry. Get up, get up. Get on your horses, get on your horses, get them. Swain, get on your horses, go after them. You let her get away you fool, you let her get away. - But I'm working for De La Marck. - But brother, what is the difference? A very great difference, take them to our cousin Yakko, he's working for Burgundy. Oh no, no. If eve I hated or mistrusted you, ever I was such a fool. Hayraddin... De La Marck, the beast will be upon us. Strange are the ways of kings, yes. Now Louis, he sends gold to De La Marck. Much gold I know, I carried myself such a way. Now, what is the purpose? To persuade the Beast to take you on your way to Leage and posses your lands. Now Your Ladyship, is this reasonable? For such a prey is the Beast should send Louis the gold... but no, it is Louis sends the money. - Louis gave me to De La Marck? - Oh yes. Now I must lie. To proclaim that I've never ever been in Louis court and protest his innocence... or see France plunged into war. - Oh Hayraddin, I could die, - Oh no Your Ladyship, no, no, no. Help him. - I'm Isabelle, of Marcroy. - Ah, child, my child. Your Grace, she's been given sanctuary by the bishop of Liege. - She denies that she ever was at Tours. - Demand her release. It is been refused. What if Louis keep his promise and comes to Peronne. - He's a liar and a coward, he won't. But if he does, you will lose your excuse for war. I will find another. - Your Majesty. - Your Grace. A most delectable gossip has come to my attention. I spent this hour with a brother of most holy manners who did recently been Liege... to embark on a pilgrimage to Spain. He mentioned entirely a parson, a certain lady recently arrived at Liege. I post to refresh Your Majesty's recollection. The Burgundian envoy on a recent visit did charge... My recollection was never fresher. Ah well, then Your Majesty will be interested to know and happy to know... that the lady in question denies irrefutably the Burgundian charges. Very interesting. I will retire, I developed the most remarkable headache. - This miserable head guard. - Dreadful, dreadful news sire, the lady... - I heard, what happened to the Scotsman? - He's at Liege, he was shot in the back. - Fatally I hope. - No. But also the Ardennes are still burying De La Marck's dead. Once, once, once in my live Master Olive, I trusted an honest man. He must've been very much in love with her sire. Oh, my head, But what you will do sir? About Burgundy? You promised to go to Peronne. On the last resort master Oliver, when all is lost. And there is no where to turn, nothing else to do, nothing. Why then king, keeps his promise. Go to Metz, take Louis's gold and buy cannon. I'm homesick for Marcroy. The garden will be blooming. - Are you homesick for Scotland? - I'm homesick for something. Oh cavalier, your silence is so sad, even the roses cry are weeping. I love you, I'd say to the sky and the wind to the roses. I say it out loud, when does a woman ever care more or a man ever care less?? You promise to tell me when we came to Liege. - I haven't had the courage. - Very well, I should wait until you find it. I should wait, dobbing your footsteps like an un-embarrassed hound... until you speak or I am an older, older woman. - I'm leaving tonight. - Leaving? - I'm well again. - But you're not. As well as I need be. - Quentin, you can't leave me. - You're safe, Hayraddin will stay with you. Where have you to go? Not to Tours, not to Louis. - To Peronne. - You are a Burgundian spy. Fell in love with the one he could shot. Oh, what drama, what irony. Not at all, it's simply that I'm the nephew of Lord Crawford. It's why I came to France to meet you, to plead his cause. - Oh Quentin, Quentin, it can not be all. - That's all. He's a vain man, dried as and old love, thin as a board, sharp as a sword. - Harden that a Scottish flint, I love him. - Your favorite uncle. Yes, I'm in his debt, it's a life long debt of gratitude, of affection and all I'm. - Even so Quentin, you love me. - Shall I no longer so repay him? Am I absurd? Yes, I see myself in all absurdity these days. A man of a sword and a word, embodied in some antique principles of right and decency. Brought through words that last by lead, and gunpowder in a king's dishonor. Forgive Isabelle, I have no choice, I can not be else of what I am. And I shall go on and on in all absurdity until I meet a suppose and most... ridiculous unremarkable grave. Oh, shall I ever see you again? Thank you Hayraddin, you needn't go any further with me. Just into town dear sir, do a little spying, it's no good a man get out of practice. That crazy man, come a little drink. It is the second time in life I'm needing a drink. Dear sir, I will pay. - Have you send Louis money back to him? - Well, I'm still thinking about it. - No, I must get out of here Hayraddin. - Oh, I'm so unhappy. How can you leave? I'm a spy, I know things, she loves you. - Yes. - I know more, I know everything. - You love her. - Yes. - How can you leave sir crazy-man? - Good bye Hayraddin, take care of her. Get him. Get for your horses. Fire. I want to see her. Cover her. Get me a priest, get me the bishop. I want to marry her. I want to marry her. Marry us, now. Oh you old fool, I'm Count William De la Marck, it's the Countess of Marcroy. Beast of the Ardennes, you swain the forest. You've defiled the house of god, you shall not defile his laws. Go back to the forest beast, animal, with my curse upon your head. Get me another priest. Stand, pig. Hail Count William De La Marck. Envoy from his friend and gracious Majesty Louis of France. I'm bringing his greetings, his congratulations... his recognition of your conquest and his blessing on this marriage. His Majesty insist however that all proper forms be obeyed. Has the lady spent her hour in meditation and confession, has mass been said. I have secured a priest to you waste. Will be my honor in the name of His Majesty to give the bride away. - After him. - After him. This way. I know there's a way out, there's a secret staircase in the wall and a secret panel. I remember it so dearly, when I visited as a girl. Oh, why I can not remember which room? Quentin. - Is there any other way up? - There is a bell tower. We can get down this way, the stairs are burning. It's the room, it's the room. I remember, right next to the bells, my godfather used to bring me here. Where is the panel in the wall? Who do you suppose on this particular evening has time to go around ringing bells? I have found, I found the... I have arrested you Louis in the name of France. I'm your king cousin, this is treason. Let these noble lords judge me, as they got you. Who is the traitor? I, who had to arrest my king? Or you who had committed a crime so fous, so inexplicable... I have committed no crimes, I came here alone, unarmed, without a guard... to settle our differences in peace and understanding. Yes and I should demonstrate before God and France... that while I sat with you at this peaceful table, that you at the same moment... that you Louis, arranged the murder of the bishop of Liege. You are under arrest, I'm still in the service, I believe, of His Majesty the king of France. His Majesty is under arrest. Keep her under guard, stay. - There will be no communication. - Durward. - He's my prisoner. - He's a Scottish subject, I insist. I will give you one minute. Escape, I can't do anything for you but get out of France. - And leave her prisoner? - I am helpless. Burgundy is in the saddle, Scotland has lost all standings. - Crawford is dead, there'll be no alliance. - Crawford? Your uncle is dead, suddenly. Such tidings, I'm sorry. Save yourself. Was it or was it not your that paid for De La Marck cannon? - I know anything whatever about it. - Was or was it not your envoy... who came to Liege, in the middle of this horror night horror... and pretend your recognition of De La Marck victory. I send no envoy. Would you condemn me without proof, without witnesses? Here is your witnesses. - Father, where are you come from? - From Liege. Were you there at the time of De La Marck assault upon the castle? Was there that I was wounded. Can you tell us, was it his majesty's gold that paid for De La Mark's cannon? - So said. - I deny, this is rumor. Good father, did you yourself witness the arrival of His Majesty's envoy? - With my own eyes. - I send no envoy. At what moment did the envoy arrived? - The bishop laid dead on the floor. - And what were the envoy's words? He brought His Majesty's greetings, his congratulations... and his recognition of De La Marck conquest. I sent no envoy, no greetings, no congratulations. - Gentlemen, gentlemen. - Your grace! - Your Grace... - There is the envoy. Tell me who you are, Durward. - Durward, tell them who you are. - Quentin Durward, in Your Majesty service. He is the man I saw with my own eyes. Durward, I beg you deny, deny, that I sent you to Liege in my name. - At your command. - Liar... You went to Liege at the time of the murder in his service. I did. Pretend yourself be His Majesty's envoy to William De La Marck? - I did. - Congratulated him, recognized his conquests? I did. Durward, how could you do this to me? - To destroy De La Marck in your name. - Let there be no more lies. - Is he. - Is De La Marck. Bravo sir, bravo. Honest Scotsman, most loyal in all my service. Until this moment, I now resign. Remove the garbage. And now my dear cousin, let us within the hour resume our negotiations... for a free, united and imperishable France. It's the talk of the castle Your Majesty that she'll give her Ladyship to De Creville. - To whom? - De Creville You Majesty. It's such to say the wild Scotsman is not going to have her. - Such lovely a man to such carnage. - You're an idiot. That's for Your Majesty to consider. Marcroy will now belong to Burgundy's first and most belligerence leftenant. - Think, Your Majesty, think. - What do you meddling I'm doing? Get on with the shaving. Cousin, concerning the Countess of Marcroy... - Ah yes, yes, the Countess. - She will marry De Creville. De Creville? Impossible, I've other plans for her my dear cousin, she will marry Dunois. - Dunois? - Dunois. - But Dunois is your chief leftenant. - De Creville is yours. - I will no more tolerate Dun... - Marcroy shall not be your exclusive pasture. - It can not be yours. - I say she will marry Dunois. I say she will marry De Creville. - I've been trying to see you. - They conspire and I await my fate. My love, my uncle is gone, is dead. - I know? - You know? I'm a free man. They give me to, to Creville. You call this negotiation our differences, giving Marcroy to Dunois? - Oh, I tell you, this is war. - Cousin, we're back where we started. - Then let's admit it and take up arms. - Wait, I have a revolutionary proposal. A shocking proposal, let us stand aside, both of us. Let us allow the lady to marry whom she pleases. Marry whom she please? - I'm too astonish to speak. - It's rather an immoral notion. - You're up to something. - No, I suggest. Purely on spirit of compromise, that is all. The lady is allow to choose her own husband. - With one exception, Dunois. - With two exceptions, De Creville. Agree. - Admit the Countess of Marcroy. - If this is one of your outrageous tricks. - Your Majesty, Your grace. - Who do you want to marry? Why do you ask when it does not concern you? Quentin Durward. No no no, impossible, Countess you can not do this to me. - Do what Keon? - Quentin Durward? Preposterous. - But you agreed, now why not? - It's ridiculous, his poor, his a foreigner. His honest, I don't trust him. No, no, I demand there must be 3 exception. - Your are ridiculous. - Cousin must I tell you, he abominates me. I confess he's a man whom I may betray once, very slightly. No, no, I can not consent. By all the same, you will consent. Caught in your own trap. - You will stand by our agreement. - I'm lost. Very well, I agree. - Take your man quickly and begone. - Thank you, Your Majesty. Let's get on with the negotiations. What happened?
