Act One The Sunday Matinee at the "Grand Cirque" just came to an end... "We would love to meet Botto the clown." "If I would be that famous, I would never reject any of them." "When they come to me, they want to laugh..." "They are chasing you because they are in love." "Mr. Andre, that little dame is waiting for you again!" " This evening... in my dressing room..." "Sigi, get rid of being that jealous all the time!..." "You are my partner and nothing else!" "You are torturing yourself in vain, she just don’t like a clown." "Where will Blanche be all the time!" "Maybe she has met a man...?!" "Blanche, why going home? Stay with me!" "If you would belong to me... I would never leave you..." "A man in a leotard!..." "My specs!" To my dear Blanche "You will not leave the house for some time. Otherwise, you won’t have to come back!" Evening Show... "How much can you earn on that trapeze? If you do this act, you’ll get 50%." " A world sensation: Jumping into Looping the loop!" "Hanna, how about doing this Looping thing with me?" "... and every night, I’ll fly right into your arms!" End of Act One Act Two "Botto, what did you mean: Hanna will never love because I’m a clown?..." "Some years ago...the most charming lady of Paris sat in her box at the circus every night..." "I was madly in love with her... and on that evening, my boldest dream came true..." "And now, please laugh in that funny way just as this evening at the circus!..." "Can’t you take me seriously?..." "You can get anything you want from me, Clown Botto, apart from taking you seriously." "Since that day, I know: you can’t love the man who makes you laugh." "Believe me: if a woman is supposed to love you, she must never know about you being a clown!" "What’s the matter?... May I help you?" "Please don’t ask!..." "Are you also... from the circus...?" "Do I look like that?" "No" "I will take you home. Which address?" "Take us to the Astoria bar!" "What will you think about me." "That girl doesn’t need to know who I am..." "I told her that I am an engineer... have to be at the factory every night... you know..." "You want to go home..." "My name is Steiner... I am the friend of your friend..." "Sick to that engineer - nice dude - lots of money!" "Will we meet again?" "You are being so kind to me... but I don’t want to upset my relatives even more." "Stop snoring!" "I have been cast out." "I will prepare the sofa for the young lady tonight." "Don’t tell the young lady about me. Tomorrow, I’ll take her back to her relatives.! End of Act Two Act Three Never before has Botto been more happier than in those weeks. "I was longing for this kind of peace... this bourgeois happiness, for so long..." "All these presents!... You are making me feel ashamed..." "Mr Bernard, it’s past 7. You have to go the factory." "The best present would have been... to dedicate just one evening to me..." "Goodbye until tomorrow at the Cafe de l´Europe!" "How about this way... much more beautiful, right...?" "It’s half past seven." "I have to take you home immediately." "If you will leave me alone again this evening, you can’t care much about me." "Don’t act like a fool, Botto!" "I can’t come! I’m in a fever!" "Lay down and sweat it all out! Tomorrow I will get you out of bed! "Don’t you know me anymore?" "You don’t know your old teacher anymore...?" "So this really was our last evening working together...?" "So you really will start that looping act with Andre tomorrow?" "It’s 11...look, TODAY you please me!" "Where is my Botto?!" "How about inviting your relatives to a little party at my place tomorrow?..." "The ticket for the Opera." "Miss Blanche did arrive!" "What was that right now?... Radio...?" "This evening, I’d like to watch Botto..." "You will not visit the circus." "You will NOT visit the circus!" "If you talk to me like this... all the more reason I’ll go!" "You promised me never to go to these places without me..." "I bought a ticket for you... for the Opera this evening..." "We are expecting you here after the Opera..." End of Act Three Act Four "To the circus!" "Announce the break!" "I almost didn’t recognize you... You became such a beauty!" "If only you knew how much I was longing for you... how much I was regretting being so dumb!" "You don’t know how much this is hurting!" "To the opera!" "If you are in need for someone who is totally devoted to you, think about me!..." "Well done. This time, I will get rid of that jealous twister." "How did you like the opera?" "So you did arrive on time?..." "And how did you like that big love Scene?" "You are sending spies after me..." "You belong to me... ME!..." "You went to the circus... to meet this Andre...!" "Your behavior is immoral!" "Tomorrow morning, you will beg for his excuse... I’ll bring you there personally!" Andre is looking for a new partner... "Last evening, you said that if I needed someone who is totally devoted to me..." "I am looking for a new partner" "You could do that as well as any other - even better! No experience necessary." "Tonight, we could be in London!" End of Act Four Act Five "Blanche has gone..." Dear Aunty! Please send all my things to London, Hotel Essex! A letter will follow. Yours truly Blanche "May I have Room 111?..." "I for once... rented that room before..." "I love you so much... please forgive me..." "Just a kiss... a single one... and I’ll leave..." Rehearsal... "My address..." "Get into the training leotard! We have to rehearse." "Hey, it’s me! The director!..." "I want to ask for a contract..." "I am... a clown..." "Fear...?" "Will it work out?" "It has to." "Maybe you think it over?" "But didn’t you became too expensive, Botto?..." "Where is your new partner?" "She is not an athlete... it can be noticed... Are you really serious about this...?" "We have a safety net!" End of Act Five Act Six "Seems like it’s not working..." "Did you sign the contract - or not?" "We had leave in a hurry... I was not able to show you my new partner." "So at least I get to know the famous Botto..." " I’m sending greetings from your former boyfriend, that engineer..." "Don’t worry... I’m discreet." "...given that I will not be forced being indiscreet..." "Did something went wrong?!..." "No, it was OK this time." "Botto... and Blanche...?" "Take her back if you can..." "...then you will see if she likes... a clown." "Shut up! She will need good nerves this evening" That evening was a triumph for Botto as it never had happened before "Coward!" "You are... so kind..." "Do you really know that I’m not worth of that kindness?" "There has been somebody who was that kind... but I ran away from him..." "If only I knew he would forgive me... I think, I would come back to him right now..." "But he will not forgive me..." "He already did forgive." Yes, I’m a clown... and now you will start laughing at me..." "You fool..." "I’m so proud of you...!" The end subs by musiclova 08/2020
