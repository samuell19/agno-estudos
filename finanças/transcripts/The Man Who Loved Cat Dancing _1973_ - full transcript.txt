I HAVE COME TO CLAIM WHAT WAS TAKEN FROM ME. MY WIFE CAT DANCING WAS OF THE SHOSHONE TRIBE. MY CHILDREN WERE BORN AFTER -- AFTER SAND CREEK AND THE SIOUX AND CHEYENNE WARS. WHEN MY WIFE DIED, IRON KNIFE BROUGHT MY CHILDREN HERE. I'VE COME TO GET THEM. YOU WILL TALK BETTER WHEN YOU EAT. OH, THANK YOU. YOU'RE RIGHT. WHAT ARE YOU CALLED? CATHERINE. CATHERINE CROCKER. YOU ARE NOT JOHN GROBART'S WIFE. NO. THE WHITE MEN NEVER LEARN. LEAVE OUT BEST PARTS OF STORY. THE CIGAR WAS ONE OF THE WHITE MAN'S GOOD IDEAS. NO, THANK YOU. THIS IS A MATTER OF THE BLOOD AND THE HEART. YOU MAY SPEAK TO THE BOY. WHAT IS YOUR NAME, SON? MY PEOPLE CALL ME DREAM SPEAKER. DON'T YOU REMEMBER THE NAME THAT YOU WERE BORN WITH? YOU REMEMBER A GAME YOU USED TO PLAY A LONG TIME AGO WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE? YOU LIKED IT VERY MUCH. YOU USED TO HIDE, AND I'D CALL YOUR NAME OUT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT? THERE WAS A THING LIKE THE BONES OF A BIG ANTELOPE. YES. YOU COULD SEE THROUGH ITS RIBS. YES. IT WAS A ROCKING CHAIR, AND YOUR MOTHER LIKED TO SIT IN IT. DO YOU REMEMBER YOUR NAME THEN? JOHN. JOHN. JOHNNY. JOHNNY. YES. JOHNNY. I WANT TO TAKE YOU AND YOUR SISTER AWAY FROM HERE. WE'LL RIDE IN A TRAIN, GO OVER A MOUNTAIN. WE'LL SEE TREES THAT GROW LIKE THE GRASS GROWS HERE. YOU'LL SEE ALL THOSE THINGS IF YOU COME WITH ME. IT WILL TAKE A STRONG HEART TO LEAVE THIS PLACE, BUT YOU HAVE A STRONG HEART, JOHN, BECAUSE I GAVE YOU A STRONG HEART, AND IRON KNIFE HAS NOT WEAKENED YOUR HEART. FOR THAT I AM GRATEFUL TO HIM. I... I AM THANKFUL ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM RICH FOR TAKING CARE OF MY SON AND MY DAUGHTER. NO. YOU UNDERSTAND WHY GROBART WAS IN PRISON ALL THESE YEARS? FOR THE SHOOTING OF THE MAN WHO LAY WITH CAT DANCING THEN KILLED HER. THAT MAN DID NOT KILL HER. HE KILLED HER. HE KILLED HER FOR LYING WITH THAT MAN, BUT SHE WAS INNOCENT. THE MAN HAD RAPED HER. THE BOY TRIED TO TELL HIM, BUT GROBART WAS FILLED WITH RAGE. HE PUSHED THE BOY ASIDE, AND HE KILLED THAT MAN AS HE RAN. THEN, STILL RAGING, HE CAME TO CAT DANCING, BUT HE WOULD NOT HEAR HER. HE KILLED HER THERE WITH HIS HANDS. NO. WHEN I FIRST BROUGHT THE BOY HERE, THERE WERE NO NIGHTS WHEN HE SLEPT ALL NIGHT. HE WOKE UP SCREAMING WILD THINGS. IT TOOK ME MANY MONTHS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HIS BAD DREAMS WERE ABOUT. HE SAW CAT DANCING DIE. HE SAW YOU KILL HIS MOTHER. THE BOY SPEAKS THE TRUTH. YOUR MOTHER... YOUR SISTER... WAS A FAITHFUL WIFE. JAY? LET IT GO, CATHERINE. I LOVE YOU, JAY. LET ME HAVE THAT. ARE YOU SUGGESTING I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEPORT MYSELF AMONGST SAVAGES? COLORFUL SHOW OF WEAPONRY, A SHOW OF FORCE. THEY UNDERSTAND LITTLE ELSE. CATHERINE. HELLO, WILLARD. I TAKE IT YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. I'M ALL RIGHT. IT'S ALL HERE. THIS JAY IS FULL OF SURPRISES. WHERE IS HE? HE LEFT. WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO?

I'LL GIVE YOU ONE MORE DAY. THAT'S AS FAR AS MY JURISDICTION GOES. DREAM SPEAKER, IT'LL BE NIGHT SOON. HOW WILL WE FIND HIM? LET US DIVIDE IN OUR SEARCH. BUT WHAT IF WE LOSE EACH OTHER? CAN YOU DO THIS? CATHERINE. HOLD ME, PLEASE. JUST HOLD ME. I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU TRACK ME FOR OVER HALF AN HOUR. I WAS HOPING YOU'D GIVE UP. TELL IRON KNIFE I THANK HIM FOR THE HELP OF... HIS SON. GOODBYE, DREAM SPEAKER. WE HAVE TIME NOW, DON'T WE, JAY? YEAH. ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD. MORNIN'. GOOD MORNING. YOU GOT ANY MONEY? NO. WELL, I GUESS WE SHOULD HAVE KEPT SOME. WE CAN ALWAYS ROB ANOTHER TRAIN. YEAH. I'LL CHECK ON YOUR HORSE. I'LL GO WITH YOU. NO. I WANT TO GO WITH YOU. I'LL COME BACK FOR YOU. PLEASE, JAY. GOD DAMN IT, CATHERINE, WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO LEARN TO DO WHAT I TELL YOU? I WILL... IF YOU'LL TELL ME JUST ONCE THAT -- THAT WHAT? IT DOESN'T MATTER. YOU'RE THE GODDAMNEDEST WOMAN I'VE EVER KNOWN. OH, MY -- I GOT HIM! JAY. JAY. OH, JAY. I GOT HIM! I GOT HIM. HA HA HA. JAY. JAY. THROW HIM OVER THE PACKHORSE. WELL, COME ON, LET'S GET MOVING! I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. CAN -- CAN YOU GET UP?
