(upbeat jazz music) - So what do you think you're doing? - Slides, slides, slides. I can't find those slides. They would start hiding now. - Why don't you try your case? You put them in there 10 minutes ago. - Look, this is no time for jokes. However, just to show you. (both chuckling) I'm sorry, Frank. It's the conference jitters. - Sure you got your speech? - [Helen] Of course, idiot. It's coming on at the end that worries me. - Nervous, huh? - What do you think? - I thought you did a lot of this sort of thing when you were in America. - Yes, but this is the first time in Germany, remember? - The weaker sex. - By the way, this is as much your stuff as mine, Dr. Overton. - Now, we settled all that two weeks ago. Let's not go over it again. Coincidentally, Joan is coming tonight. - Joan, Joan, Joan, no, don't tell me. Joan, Joan? - My wife. (sighing) - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Frank. (chuckling) - You're forgiven. Come on, the old man's waiting. - Well, I'm ready when you are. - [Frank] Can you imagine, the girl says she's nervous. - I shouldn't be surprised. (chuckling) (gentle instrumental music) (birds chirping) (people chattering) - Well, the great man himself. Hello, Sir Keith. - Hello, Overton. And you, obviously. - Sir Keith. - And this, I'm sure, is our charming German colleague, Dr. Wieland. - How do you do, sir? - How do you do? I've heard a lot about your exciting work with Overton. That's why I came here, to tell you what I think of it. - Well, I hope you won't be too disappointed, Sir Keith. - Here, park this for me, will you, Frank, and I'll catch up with you later. I ran into Lasa the other day. He was asking, one afternoon. - That pompous old fool, he gives me a pain. - Well, forget him. Think of my worries instead. (chuckling) - The rats were raised in a cold environment and made only to breathe with expert air in a closed vessel. So that the proportion of oxygen decreased and carbon dioxide increased. - Where are we supposed to sit? - Right in front, looks like. - Naturally the body temperature fell to minus 70 degrees centigrade. As you might well suppose, the overall effect of this- - [Radio Announcer] Join us at the same time next week, for Joan Overton's next interesting talk on current fashion. - Well, Joan, my love, if you think that's a fashion talk, you should be hung, drawn, and quartered. - Why? What's wrong with it? - What's wrong with it? - Telling all those nice kids to buy a good suit that will last years, and just bring good changes on the accessories. It's positively immoral. Hello. How long have you had this cheap old rag? - Hmm, three days. - And how long do you intend to keep it? - Well, it depends if my loving husband likes it or not. He hasn't seen it yet. - I bet he won't like it. - Why not? - Oh our baby or do I have to make you a drawing? - Oh that, oh well, he's used to that. He won't mind. - What makes you think so? I used to. - Aw. Do you really think that I've overdone it? - If it were anybody else, I'd say yes. But as it's you. Come on, I've got my page to look after and it's getting late. - Aw, let's have one for the road. - You can't have, you can't go to a scientific meeting smelling of drink. (chuckling) - You're joking. It'll be over by the time I get there, with any luck. - Well, then why the finery? - Female competition. - Ah, now you're moving into my country. And what does that mean? - Helen Wieland. - Helen Wieland, who's she? - A beautiful scientist. (whistles) - The plot thickens. Come, come, come. - Well, she was called in by the World Health Service, and Frank was asked to help her, and man, does she need help. I don't see Frank these days. - What the hell do they do? - Believe it or not, they stick chimpanzees into a deep freeze for a few months, and bring them out alive. - Both the parent chimpanzees have been deep frozen and kept in the cold store at a temperature of minus 80 degrees centigrades for three month before they were mated. We have been carrying out very exhaustive tests. None of the experimental animals have suffered any damage to the brain or major nerve centers whatsoever. (audience applauding) In conclusion, there great problem until now of all low temperature work with large animals has been how to stop the heart and then freeze the blood quick enough to prevent brain damage from oxygen starvation. Thankfully Dr. Frank Overton's thermal control panel has solved this difficulty. But now we find ourselves face to face with a very intriguing question, where next? I'm afraid I'll shall have to ask Dr. Overton to deal with that part of the discussion. Thank you very much for your attention. (audience applauding) - Oh, can you tell me where the low temperature lecture is? - Yeah, first floor. - Thank you. - Excuse me, madam, do you have an invitation? - Invitation? My husband is Dr. Frank Overton. Is there anything else? - Second to your right, thank you. - On the contrary, thank you. - What's the maximum period of a successful cold storage? - Well, our maximum is three months, but in theory that can be extended to three years, 30 years, 300 years, just as long as you like. It makes no difference. They'd still comes back as good as new. It's very simple, for where life is suspended time actually has no meaning at all. - I should like to know if you foresee any possibility of extending your experiments to the human animal. It occurs to me, for instance, that some of our aging politicians might welcome the idea of going to cold storage (audience laughing) until the next general election. - We'd be very happy to oblige to the opposition. Although, I'm afraid they might like a trial or a test run first. Perhaps the questionnaire would like to volunteer to be the first guinea pig. (audience laughing) - [Man] I must admit it's a rather odd question, but seriously, I take it that you're still a long way from human deep freeze. - Oh no, sir. - You go ahead, you go ahead. I'll handle the big bets. - Well, the question is, are we still a long way from human deep freeze? The answer is no, we are right on the doorstep. Dr. Overton and I are convinced that we could take a suitable a human being, freeze him, and revive him with all his faculties intact. All we want is a chance to show we can do it. - How would you know there was no brain damage? (audience clamoring) - We haven't had any problem with the chimps. - Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry, but our time is up and I'm afraid the fascinating subject of deep freezing the human animal must itself go into cold storage for the moment. It only remains for me to thank all our contributors for this very interesting symposium on hypothermia. - You haven't noticed. - Haven't noticed? How can I miss it, darling. I'll get you a drink. - I'll have a scotch. - You mean a sherry. - Oh Frank, Frank, do come and tell. My voice is giving out. - Very nice to have seen you again. Goodbye. - Sorry, Doctor, but I need to have a word with you. - Oh dear, I was just going to talk to Mrs. Overton. - Unfortunately, they're supposed to leave in a minute. - Oh, very well. - Darling, no Sherry, only champagne. - Oh, I hate it. - I'm sorry to hang you up like that. - It was my fault Mrs. Overton. I didn't realize Frank was getting you a drink. - Do call me Joan. It's much friendlier under the circumstance. - Yes, I'd like to. I expect you know my name is Helen. - Yes, I saw it in the program. I'm sorry I couldn't get in here before. I'm sure your speech must've been fascinating. (chuckling) Darling, would you get me another? - I think we've ought to get something to eat. - Oh you poor doll, you must be starving. Why didn't you say something before? You must come and have a meal with us some time, Helen. - [Frank] What do you mean some time? There's no time like the present. - All right. You're very kind and I'd love to, but the speech making has worn me out. I can hardly wait to get back home. Thank you very much. - Well, you're sure you won't change your mind? - Uh no, not tonight. Good bye. - Good bye. That's too bad, I wish she'd join us. - You know I think you and Helen's got something. Perhaps we should go home after all. - [Frank] I thought you wanted to show off your new outfit. - Darling, I only wore it to please you. - [Frank] Let's go. - I hope I've made myself clear. I cannot have the unit associated, in anyway, with deep freeze experiments on humans. - Of course, but it's a point we must reach one day. - Not while I'm in charge, I hope. - By the way, are you free next Friday morning? - I'm not sure. Why? - They're going to refreeze Susie. - Susie? - Yes, the mother chimpanzee in that family group that Helen Wieland, showed us. Why don't you come along and watch? - Well, I'll see what I can do. So long. (dramatic orchestral music) - What temperature is she now? - Minus 10. - Oh. She doesn't look frozen to me. - Stupid old fool. - And don't forget she's absorbed about a gallon of glycerol. That's why she hasn't iced up yet. - Martin, did you put a new cylinder in? - Yes, sir. You're wanted on the telephone, long distance. - All right, thanks Martin. Can you manage, Helen? - Yes, of course. - Now we're taking her right down to minus 80. - Is that carbon dioxide? - Yes, we freeze it around her. - [Keith] What's the point? Why not pack her in dry ice, straight away. - First thought, yes, yes, but uh on second thought, no. - You see, Sir Keith, the body surface will cool much quicker than the interior if we did that. Now this way, all the body processes are arrested simultaneously. Then it shall stay sweet and sound until we wake it up. - I see. - Are you ready, Martin? - [Martin] Yes, sir. - All right, let's go. (mysterious orchestral music) - Oh yes. Just a minute. How much? How much? (whistling) You couldn't have timed it better. But I better take that down. - Hold it a minute, Frank. Well, there's your ice, Sir Keith. - That's quick. - Just as well, cause you're pretty tired at that state. - Minus 75, going on automatic. - All right Martin, let's wrap her up. - Minus 80 on automatic, stabilizing. - [Hubbard] Are you through? - Yes. - [Hubbard] Good. - That was the most impressive demonstration, most impressive, indeed. - You must again when they do the resuscitation. That's much more exciting to watch. Oh by the way, I've laid out tea in my office. Will you come, Helen, and you Frank? - No, we were going to get Teddy ready. - Oh surely you could spare a few minutes. As I was saying, when the heart starts beating again and you hear the first sounds on the amplifier that's really exciting. - Ah, as the tea doesn't seemed to have turned up, why don't I read you a message I've just received by telephone. Perhaps you would like to drink a glass of champagne in honor of the winners of the Alexis Carrel Award. (light orchestral music) Helen Maria Wieland of Munich Germany and Francis Henry Overton of Boston USA, for their remarkable advances in the field of low temperature research, which opens up far reaching possibilities in human surgery. - Carrel award. (cork popping) - That's almost on par with the Nobel Prize. - Certainly in terms of cash. They'll get $25,000 each. - 20... - Frank. (laughing) - Yes $25,000 and you can spend it all of this if you would like. Oh I'm sorry, would you have preferred tea? (phone ringing) - 12-4-5-9-6. Frank! - Hi darling, just wanted to check and see if you were there. I'll be along shortly. - I don't believe it, you naughty liar you. - Well it depends on how you look at it. Sit tight, I'll be there in a few minutes. - Great, bye. - What's all that about? - Put your skates on, Frank's coming home. - What's going on? Half turn, parent's day, Arch Bishops street? - Cut the wise talk and go man just go, huh? - Are you trying to get rid of me? - Oh no. What do you think? - Oh Joan is really excited. For the first time in her life, she can have anything, do anything she wants. - It must be the champagne. I still can't take it in. - Ah, here you are. I've just been speaking to Professor Hubbard about another matter, which he thinks you both ought hear about, right away. It concerns you in particular, Overton. - Oh what is that, sir Keith? - This splendid piece of news has come just at the right moment, to set the scene on your work with Dr. Wieland. Worthy victors, Scotland so to speak. So now we must give you new fears to conquer. Professor Batrol wants you to take over the remote control center for their radiation investigation. - Why, Sir Keith we, we just barely scratched the surface of this low temperature project. - Precisely. The trial and error is finished. It's time for the big battalions to step in. - [Frank] You may be right, but you still need us. - [Keith] I've considered the possibility and decided that Dr. Wieland should carry on here. - You mean you want to break us up now, when we've just reached the final stage of our work? - What exactly do the words final stage refer to, Dr. Wieland? - The first human experiment, of course. - I consider all this talk about the human deep freeze experiment extremely ill-advised and premature. - The Alexis Carrel Trusties don't seem to share your opinions, Sir Keith. - No one hopes more fervently than I, for the day when suffering humanity can be treated by your method and be cured, but it would be fatal to encourage false hopes, despite the enthusiasm of the current trusties. - You don't think for one minute that we've been conducting these experiments for the welfare of a half a dozen monkeys, do you? - [Keith] The high policy of the executive is outside your terms of reference, Dr. Overton. - Well what the hell you think we've been doing here? - I just don't want you around when Frank gets back, that's all. - Why not? A little competition will do him a world of good. - Look- - He might stop thinking of you as simply another body for the deep freeze. - What are you trying to do? - Look in the mirror, my sweet. I'm trying to get a very attractive woman back into circulation. - If a chimpanzee dies during an experiment, that's one thing, but a human life is quite different. I'm sorry, but the risk of failure is much too great. - Sir Keith, the certainty of destruction by incurable disease is absolute. It is only by experiment and occasional failure, we discover the knowledge and techniques that make for success. All we are asking for is to carry out these experiments in a calm and secure atmosphere. - That is no part of my responsibility. - It most certainly is. And until you give your word, the millions of people throughout the world suffering from incurable diseases will have to face their fate as best they can. - You know what my mother used to say? "The years race by you, but the magic lingers." That's how it is with us, Joan. - You are wasting your time. Look, we had our little interlude and it was over the day I met Frank, you knew that. Nothing has changed, it's Frank now and always. - In my experience as a crime writer- - Oh, clear off! You're reaching the point of no return, and it'll hurt you more than it'll hurt me! (light jazz music) - I think that young woman is most persuasive. - Possibly, because her fiancee died of cancer. - Ah, that accounts for it. - I think if I knew I had only a few weeks to live, I'd volunteer for her. - By the way, Hubbard, I think you ought to step in. - Huh? - You must tell them that human experiments are out. They'll take it better from you. In the mean time of course I should consult with the authorities. Well I must be going now. - You mean you'll sit on the fence and if someone makes a fuss later, I shall take the rap. - My dear Hubbard, I had no such thought in mind. - Well put your veto in writing for the record and if you do that, I'll cross it off. (light jazz music) - Eight or 9000 pounds. - In dollars that's $25,000, any way you look at it. - Oh Frank! Oh, what can we do with it? - Whether you'd like. What would you like? (sighing) - Nice little things. We can have another car, you know a little one for town. And then we can have a fabulous holiday. And we can have a little period cottage for the weekend. - You know, it's something I've been thinking about, not the weekends, but the place in the country, you know long walks and fresh air. I could commute, it'd give me a chance to catch up on my reading. - Yeah, and what about my job? - Listen, what about your job? Don't you think it's about time you were quitting it? - Oh yeah, but- - Don't all the money you make either goes in taxes or you spend it on clothes. I don't know I, we've been married five years, I'd like to start thinking about having kids. - Kids? - Yeah, You want a family, don't you? - Well, sure, but- - Good, that's settled then. - Yeah, let's celebrate to that. When do we start? - Start what? - Why, looking for the house. - Oh. (chuckling) On weekends, it'd be fun driving around. - And when we find what we want, I start raising the family, is that it? - The sooner the better, as far as I'm concerned. That's up to you. - Mm-hmm, and when does Helen Wieland leave from Munich? - Oh I, uh, I don't know. - Well, you don't have to look so upset about it, Frank. - Upset, but what is Helen Wieland got to do with our having a family? - Look, if you think I'm going to lose my looks, and my figure, retire to this grand house in the country, take long walks and plenty of fresh air while you catch up on your reading, with that woman around, you're crazy. - You're not serious. You can't be jealous of Helen. - No more than you are of Tony. Look, you can call it, uh intelligent anticipation. You may not be in love with her, but she certainly is in love with you. - Let me set you straight about something, Helen and I work together, we work together harmoniously, but it begins and ends with our work. What do you think we are, a couple of newspaper people? - Touche. But you're human and so is she. - And you're out of your mind! - Am I? Well, I watched her at that lecture hall- - Why don't you knock it off? Just knock it off! But now that you mention it, yes, she is attractive and she's human also. - Where are you going? - I'm working tonight! - Oh, on another experiment, huh? - All night! - Oh yes, every night! (door slamming) Oh! (phone ringing) Hello! Tony. (light jazz music) - Was she thrilled? - I guess you might say she was. She got a little steamed up. - No surprise, I got steamed up too. - No, she got steamed up in a different way, she's annoyed because I can't take her to dinner tonight. - Well, why shouldn't you? All you have to do is verify those figures and then Martin and I can do the rest. You see at 11-5, the cryogenic model of 8-0 was at minus 14, and then 10 minutes late, (light orchestral music) 10 minutes later. It would be better if you went home. - You want me to? - Yes. - I'll, I'll call her. - [Helen] I better see what Martin's up to.

(light jazz music) - Oh. - Excuse me, Mr. Stein, you're wanted on the telephone, please. - Oh hell. Sorry, darling. - Don't be too long, because I haven't got a gold wristwatch. (chuckling) - Stein, here. Ah, John, what do you want me for? What do you mean it's urgent? It's a whole night's work. I'm damned if I'm going to do it. All right, you get JB to the phone. I'll tell him myself. (light jazz music) - Hi. To the queen of the jungle. - Hi, elephant boy. (speaking foreign language) Huh? - Dancing, madam. - Oh, why sure, elephant boy. Come on (light jazz music) - But look here, JB. Surely, the paper doesn't know anybody at all. It's damned unfair. Ah, all right. But it's the last time. - [Joan] Tony, where have you been? - Look Joan, we have got to go. - Oh, but I was just beginning to enjoy myself. - I've got to write an article for tomorrow's copy. Put it on the slate, Charlie. Come on. - Oh, but it's early. What time is it? (keys clacking) What are you doing? Writing your memoirs? - You keep quiet, Joan. - Yeah, if you had some booze. - Haven't you had enough? - That's a great question. - Well you've drained me dry of whisky. - Ha! - Well, there's gin somewhere. If you find it, you can have that. (humming) But don't blame me for your head in the morning. - That's empty. That's empty. Ah. Hey, what's this? Huh? - Put that thing down. - Which thing? - The gun. And always remember the old saying, never, not even in fun, point a gun at anyone. It's a damn stupid thing to do. - All right don't blow your top. What you keep it for anyway? - It's a souvenir, I got it from a crook. I white washed him in a very dirty story. (keys clacking) - Tony, listen, when you finish writing your love letter, could we go to that little jungle place again, because I liked it there. - By the time I end this story, it will probably be daybreak. - Oh, don't be a spoil sport, Tony. You said we were having fun. Look, you said it was just like the old days, remember? - Why don't you go home? And as you decided to wonder about, all right do that, go back to your jungle. I'm going to work, in peace. All right? (door slamming) - Oh, jump in the lake. (suspenseful orchestral music) Good night! - Don't worry about it. Even if Sir Keith does put his veto in writing, I shall bring the matter up again at the Scientific Counsel. - Thank you. - I've already told Frank. He took it very calmly, considering he's not exactly fond of Sir Keith at the best of times. - Joan asked him to take her out tonight. - Very natural under the circumstances. - Uh yes, I mean, um I think they must have had a pretty bad quarrel, in fact, I know they did. - Well that's their business, isn't it? - Oh yes, of course. It's just I'm sorry it happened, that's all. - Helen, has it occurred to you that Frank's wife may feel, rather, shut out? - I don't see why. Ours has just been a happy working relationship. - I know. But it's not always easy to keep it that way. Goodnight. - I certainly asked for it, but I'm sorry you had to say it. It was necessary. You see, I've been very careful. - Mm-hmm. (Joan yelling) (Martin yelling) - Huh, there you are. I suppose, I'm the last person you want to see. (chuckling) Well, the same goes for me. I've got something to tell you. Most important, I- - Martin, will you tell Dr. Overton is wife is here. - Huh, I don't want to see him. I want to see her. As a matter of fact, you can go too. The world is full of people like you. But you're wasting my time. But you are not going to get the better of me. Oh no. You're going to get more than what you've bargained for. - What the- - Helen, you'd better go. - No, no. - What's going on here? Come on Joan, let's go home. - [Joan] No. - Come on, let's go. - [Joan] No, no, ah! No! Let me go! I want to see her! - Poor Frank. Bring him up when I've gone. Tell him not to worry about it. Nobody'll ever refer to it again. Do you hear, Helen? - Yes, I'll do that. - [Hubbard] What a queer sort of day it's been. - What you have to put up with. When you leave me, they'll say what a bitch. I'm surprised it lasted that long. That'll suit your book, won't it? Why don't you say something? - What the hell you want me to say? Look, why don't you get your clothes off and get into bed. Talk about this thing in the morning. - I want to talk now. - You're in no condition to talk about anything now. You- (phone ringing) - I wish I was dead. - Ah, that's a bright drunken speech. Hello. Helen, good of you to call. (sighing) Yes, it's all right now. - Professor Hubbard asked me to let you know. - Oh, that was nice of him, Helen. Thank you. Well, I'm not worried, it's just that- - Glad he didn't see this. (clattering) - Hold on, will you? What are you doing with that? (suspenseful orchestral music) Give me the gun, Joan. - No, Frank, don't. - Give me the gun, Joan. Give me the gun. - No, no! (gun firing) - Frank? Frank. Frank! Are you hurt? - Helen? (sighing) - Thank God. I thought I heard a gun go off. - No, no, nothing. No, she tripped over a lamp and the bulb exploded. I'll try and get over later. (phone clicking) (light jazz music) - I thought I killed you. - That wasn't very bright of me, but I thought you were going to do something stupid. - I only tried to hide it. I didn't want you to see it. - Where did you get the gun, Joan? - Tony's. I took it. He didn't know. - How long have you had it? - Tonight I went to around to his place after, after we had our quarrel. - You mean you had this thing when you came to the lab tonight? - I only meant to frighten her. I was mad. I, I was all mixed up, just must've been the scotch. - You brought this thing along to frighten Helen? - I swear to you I didn't take it out of the bag. See, she didn't see, honestly. - Did you know the gun was loaded? - Don't look at me like that. - Answer me, did you know it was loaded? - No, I didn't! Tony said it was empty. It wasn't his fault, Frank. Let me give it to him back. Please, Frank, please! You've got to believe me. I swear to you, I didn't know it was loaded. I was so unhappy. I wanted her to know that, to see what she was doing to me. Frank, I've tried. For weeks and weeks I felt you going further and further away from here. I didn't know what to do. I know she's the kind of woman you ought to have married. I couldn't let you go, I love you too much. Oh, I just felt divided, I didn't have a showdown, I'd go out of my mind. (dramatic orchestral music) - I'm probably more to blame than you are. You can stop worrying about Helen, I'm being transferred next week. (dramatic orchestral music) Well, it's empty now. - Are you ready to start now, Dr. Wieland. - Yes but Dr. Overton said he'd ring, so lets give him a few more minutes. Oh by the way, is their any more coffee? - What, again? - Yes, again. I'm an addict. - Of course. - Frank. - I thought you've gone to bed. - Yeah, I'm going in a minute, but I, I wanted to talk to you. - All right. - Do you think we can get away for a little while? You know just a little holiday. I don't suppose you could fix that, huh? - I could. It would mean helping Helen with that experiment tonight. Can't let her do it alone, I mean all night, which you're not very fond of. - Ah why, darling. Oh I love you so much. I hope the experiment will be a great big smashing success. - It will be. It better be. (dramatic orchestral music) (phone ringing) - 12-4-9-5-6. - [Tony] Joan? - Tony. - [Tony] What have you done with my gun? - Oh well, I was going to play a silly joke and unfortunately, misfired. - Misfire? - [Joan] Well I was gonna bring it back. Come and fetch it. - All right. - All right, Martin, we started. - Helen, thanks for calling me. - [Helen] Frank? - I'm glad you didn't go ahead with Jackie. - [Helen] I was just going to. - I've got a much better idea. You realize, of course, that once Vernon puts that detail in writing, we're sunk, we can't go ahead without getting covered in hot water. We've got to be there first. - Yes, but how? - Tonight we're going to experiment on me. Don't look so shocked. I don't know why I didn't think of this thing sooner. I'm perfect for the experiment, right weight, everything. Believe me, it'll go like clockwork, you'll see. Oh, here are the ratio figures for the human experiment. All we have to do is add an extra liter of glycerol. - No. It's too much of a risk. - What do you mean too much of a risk? There is no risk. We've been saying there's no risk. - I know, I know, but it's different when you're faced with it. I mean we could be wrong. Will the human heart stand it? And what about brain damage from oxygen starvation? And what about your wife? - I'm doing this for Joan too. - No, Frank. No. I won't do it. I can't. Not with you, I'd be too scared of something going wrong. Unless, of course, that's what you want. - You're outnumbered yourself. Helen, do you realize what this means, if this experiment is successful and it's bound to be successful. It opens up unlimited possibilities for the world of surgery, and think of future generations, Helen. It'll free them of malignant disease. Look, it's something we've discussed 1,000 times back and forth, it's something agreed upon, something you'd do yourself. Well isn't it? Answer me. - All right, you win. - Naturally. Martin, we're going to conduct our first human experiment tonight. You're going to be a part of it. - Well you don't expect me to- - No, no, no, it's on me, it's on me. - Joan, are you going to be long? - [Joan] Coming right away. - [Tony] Your sweater, you owe me an explanation. What does this mean? - Oh, I haven't seen that. Well, it just went off. Come, don't worry, have a drink. - [Tony] All right, I need it, and put that gun down. - Oh, that's all right, don't worry, it isn't loaded. I've made sure of that. - This is no laughing matter. If there had been an accident, I might have landed in jail. - With your uncle, a police vice president? - More than ever. I had never got it licensed. Which it would've been handed into the police. Incidentally, whilst bearing our souls, where's Frank? - On his last experiment. - Oh, like to the apes? Name your poison, Joan. There's no whisky. - Lime juice please. I'm on the wagon, from now on. - For how long? - [Joan] Forever. - What, ever? - Forever and ever. You don't believe me, do you? Well, here's auf wiedersehen to Joan, the- (gun firing) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Don't move. I'll phone for an ambulance. You'll be all right. Don't worry, Joan. (muttering) - Tony. - I'm here, Joan. - Why, why did I say it was empty? Why? - It's an automatic, so you thought it was empty. The last bullet was in the muzzle. I should've checked it. - Oh my. Frank. - What do you mean? - Frank didn't know. - You mean Frank doesn't know it was my gun? (eerie ambient music) (dramatic orchestral music) - The heart stops here, and the blood freezes here at minus one, and this is where every second is going to count. We've got to close the gap faster than we have ever done it before. We must have a bigger safety margin. - Because of his brain. - Yes, this is where there is a risk of damage, if we are unlucky. - You better hurry up, Helen, or I'm gonna fall asleep on you. - I'm coming, Frank. Yes, Martin? - How shall I enter this, Dr. Wieland? - What was our last serial numbers? - X700. - Well then, experiment X701. - Human. (suspenseful orchestral music) Zero. Minus one. - Set for minus 10 on full current. Good. Six seconds to spare. - Will he be all right? - He looks all right so far. - He looks different from the chimps, doesn't he? (suspenseful orchestral music) (knocking on door) (woman screaming) (gasping) - Oh, I'm sorry. - You're tired, aren't you? What's wrong? Trouble with the experiment? - I hope not. You see, it isn't Teddy. Frank came back last night. He insisted, he- - Frank? - We talked about Sir Keith trying to stop us from doing a human experiment. He said we must get in first. Must, must, must. - Is that all? Oh, you know Frank. As usual he started on our mission to humanity. He cornered me. What could I say? - So Frank offered himself as a guinea pig and you accepted it. Because of his wife? - What's she got to do with it? - Does his wife know? Well, when you're going to bring him back? - Tonight. Martin will come at seven o'clock. (phone ringing) - Yes. Well, what's he want? Oh, I see. Oh, well send him in. There's a man from the police. He wants to see Frank. - He can't, can he? - Any idea what he wants? - No. No! - Well, then you better go home. - Oh no, please let me stay. - Why don't you tell me? - Afterwards perhaps. (knocking on door) - Come in. Good morning. - Sorry to bother you. I'm Detective Inspector Prenton. This is Sergeant Grun. - I'm Professor Hubbard and this is Dr. Wieland. - Morning, ma'am. - I understand you want to see Dr. Overton. - If he's here, sir. - He is. - I thought he might be, his car is outside. - But he's not available at the moment. - Well, better make him available. - That's not so easy. He's involved in an experiment. - Well he had better stop for a while. I've got some important questions to ask him. - I'm afraid he's unconscious. Perhaps you'd better tell me what you want him for. - At this stage, it's none of your business, sir. - Then you better make it my business, inspector. We may want to keep Dr. Overton unconscious for weeks, even months. - Well, understand that you will hinder the police and their execution of their duty. - No, I'm asking you to tell me what you want to talk to Dr. Overton about? - Well, we think Dr. Overton can help us in connection with his wife sudden and violent death, by shooting. (gasping) - [Helen] No. - Perhaps Dr. Wieland can be more helpful. - One moment inspector, this lady is a member of an international organization. Shouldn't you warn her that she doesn't have to answer your questions of this state? - Yes, yes, of course. I was about to do that. Hi, Doctor. - I can, I can only say, I'm very shocked to hear the news. He's a dear friend and colleague. - Yes, yes I only want facts. - For the early part of the evening, he was here, his wife called, he, they left, and later he returned to do the experiment. - Does he know? - I'll answer that Helen. At the moment Dr. Overton is in the next room in a glass case surrounded by solidified gas at about minus 40 degrees centigrade, and as you might expect, his life processes are suspended. - He's either alive or dead- - I mean what I say, suspended. - Alive? - Alive. - Well, I suppose he can be revived. - Well, this is an experiment. - Can I see that case? - Yes, you can see it. - [Prenton] You stay here. - Yes, sir. (suspenseful orchestral music) (machines whirring) - Are you prepared to swear he's inside. - Yes. - And alive? - I hope so. I can't raise the dead. - It will be very awkward if he'd passed on. What you have told me is called a human experiment. I hope that's the truth. For your sakes. - Scientists are as interested in the truth as the police, Inspector. - Have either one of you even supposed that the Dr. wouldn't undergo the experiment in the hope of escaping from the consequences of his actions? - Dr. Overton is a brilliant medical scientist. If he wanted to escape anything permanently, all he would have to do is inject himself with some drug, go to sleep peacefully and not wake up again. - Does that answer your point, Inspector? - I want Dr. Overton revived as soon as possible. - I'll think about it, Inspector. Dr. Wieland has been working intensely for over 24 hours and there are many other considerations which don't concern you. I'll let you have my decision later in the day. - You're probably very wise, Professor. The human mind plays funny tricks when suffering from lack of sleep. Sergeant, I want you to stay in the laboratory, until I send relief. - [Grun] Sir. - What are our chances? - I can only use the technique we developed, and pray. - Oh, so your secretary did manage to get a hold of you. - She did indeed. I've been traveling the hold day. - I thought you wouldn't want to miss the fun. - I'm certainly relieved to see that the whole place isn't swarming with reporters. - No, because we've persuaded the police to let us finish the resuscitation in peace. - In peace? Hubbard, don't you realize the full implications of this business? - You don't know the facts yet. - The facts are obvious. Overton shot his wife, returned to the laboratory, and it's for Wieland's willing connivance embarked on this experiment. Either it's a red herring or a vile doctor penance. - The police haven't ruled out suicide. - Merely because the wound could've bee self-inflicted, but how could a dying woman dispose of a weapon. And why on Earth should she? - So, the gun wasn't found? - If the experiment fails, as I've no doubt it will, and Overton escapes justice, the whole affair will become a public scandal. We shall all be involved. For all we know, we'll no doubt be charged with being an accessory after the fact. Your control of your staff will be severely criticized, not to say anything about my own authority. - Oh, I'm sure you'll come out all right. - I intend to, in the interest of the organization. - Well, are you to stay and watch? - Naturally. - Do you know Karl Merkeimer, the pathologist? He's here. - Karl Merkeimer, here? - The police wanted an independent medical observer. - Why? - To make sure that Helen does everything she can to bring Frank back alive, I imagine. - Karl Merkeimer of all people. - Oh, he's quite a nice chap. - I don't care what he's like! Every Tom, Dick, and Harry in this country knows his name and connects it with sensational criminal trials. This is getting worse and worse. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Things should start happening pretty fast now. - How soon can you tell his brain's undamaged? - He'll be able to talk for a minute or two and then he'll slip back into a sort of coma. - A coma, and how do you deal with that? - By stimulating the heart. - We could trigger that, yeah. Judging how much you give him is a difficulty, I would imagine. - Yes, I have to be careful not to overstimulate or he might die of shock. - Would you say then, that the final stage is the most critical? - In, uh, this case, yes. - This is Dr. Merkheimer. Sir Keith Vernon - How do you do? - What are these for? - Emergency use. - If he looks like passing out? - No, in case one of you are come over, here. - [Helen] Martin, are you ready? - Coming, Doctor. - They will soon be opening up the coffin. Stick by the door and keep it quiet. - Can't I watch, sir? - That keen, aren't you? - Only scientifically minded, sir. - Sorry, you have fool heart already. On the door, Grun. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Minus one standard pressure. - Minus one standard pressure. - Serum modulator to 50. - Serum modulator to 50. - Zero. - Zero. - Switch on half amplified. - Switch on half amplified. (sighing) - Give me the police vice president, please. (suspenseful orchestral music) - [Helen] 18. - [Hubbard] 18. - 19. - [Hubbard] 19. - Cut dial femoral generator - [Hubbard] Cut dial femoral generator. - Now! Skin texture has returned already. We can help him with some artificial respiration. The amplifier on? - Yes. - We'll start at 600cc and give me a pulse rate when you get one. (machine hissing) (heart beating) - Pulse rate 40, rising, 48, 52. Heart fibrillation becoming even. - He's on the verge of consciousness, now. We should know in a few moments whether, whether he's normal. When I put him under I asked him to stop counting at 12. If his brain is undamaged it should pick up his last memory pattern and he'll go on counting where he left off. Frank. It's me. Do you hear me? Frank. Frank. Frank. (voice echoing) - Joan, I couldn't. I didn't mean to. - You can talk to Joan later. Just go on counting. - 12, 13, 14, 15. - That's wonderful, Frank. Thank you. It's all you have to do. - Helen. - So, you recognize me? That's a mercy. - Why? Didn't you want me to? I'm a very clever fella. Walk the dog, play baseball, Tiddlywinks. - [Helen] You're wonderful, Frank. But now relax and let me do the rest. - Anything you say, Doctor. - [Hubbard] Pulse rate 58, blood pressure 90 to 70, falling. - [Helen] Electrodes. - Electrode. - Gloves. Electrodes. We'll start at 250, time check every 30 seconds. - Start at 250, time check every 30 seconds. (heart beating) - He's not out of the woods yet, is he? - No. Not yet. - Four minutes and 430, pulse 62. - Step up complex C to 500. - Step up complex C to 500. - It's an open and shut case of murder. - [Grun] Yes, sir. I took Tony's testimony down as evidence. - We are going to need it - [Hubbard] Four minutes at 500, pulse 64. - Cut off. - Are these instructions? - Cut off. - [Hubbard] The amplifier? - No, the heat. - End the heat? - Has he had enough? - Yes, I'm not prepared to risk any more. Injection. - Pulse rate, 56. (machine whirring) (phone ringing) - Stop that phone ringing. - Martin. - I didn't get it, sir. - Don't do that, sir. He'll think it's me. - Who is it? - The police vice president. - Hello. Yes, thanks, I will. - Pulse? - [Martin] 36. - What's happening? - No response to injection. Blood pressure still falling. - What the devil's gone wrong? Why don't you inject into the heart? - Sir Keith. - The police vice president wants you, Inspector. Dr. Overton's wife shot herself accidentally. A witness has come forward. - Keep on monitoring, no matter what happens. You'll need gloves. I'm going to jump the charge up. (machine humming) - [Hubbard] Contacts scorching. Contacts scorching. (heart beating) (light orchestral music) - Frank. - Hi there. - For a minute, I thought I lost you. - One year ago, those of us who knew Dr. Overton never doubted for a moment that his motives in volunteering for this remarkable experiment were purely scientific. More than anyone else am delighted and relieved that it was serious for. Because of the heavy responsibility that falls on any commander- - "Who encourages his crack troops to venture into no-man's land, but it was a responsibility I was glad to take." (laughing) - That old fake. He didn't say that a year ago. - Well, good luck to him. Life would be a lot better the Sir Keith's of this world. (light orchestral music) (birds chirping)
