As the legend, this place is close to the sea in the east, so it is called as the Jiuhe City It is the wharf controlling the south and north canals, water and land paths. However strong you are, there is always someone stronger. Different people gather here. Whatever people can be found here, regardless of dragon or snake. Just as the saying, areas with branch rivers will always have strange persons, and places of converging water have more extraordinary heroes with special abilities There are the so-called “seven extraordinary and eight strange people” here, including evil or just people, kind or bad people. Now that there are kindness and evilness, there have been stories of good and evil fight, as well as heterodoxy. The strange thing I want to tell you today is not known by many people. I just knew it from a n ancestral book. If you want to ask how strange it is, I want to tell from the underground. What does the dragon and snake in Jiuhe mean? Dragon and snake originally had the same root. If the snake could be cultured for one thousand years, it would also turn into a dragon. It means that, if there is a dragon in the Jiuhe, it will certainly hung up your plan. Dare to hung up my plan, no matter it is a dragon or a snake, I must revenge. I will certainly make Jiuhe City Blood out. Don’t remove. Don’t move. What are you doing? You could not remove the fire deity statue. The fire deity protects us every year. If you insist on doing this, you will be punished by the god. What did you say? In this world, if you want to get wealth, Just do business; if you want to have more children, Married a wife. The fie deity is useless. Why is the fire deity useless? Why is the fire deity useless? Guys, move this away. Hey, OK. Boys, watch out. Come on, help me. No. I still have to find a way to sell out my bad fortune elimination sign. Fire deity! Slow. Feudalistic superstition. Pray to fire deity. Boys, hurry up. After doing this, we can have steamed buns. OK. Keep stable. OK. Why is itchy? Not at all, this way. Help me. Right. Left side. OK, OK, OK. Be careful. This is the ancestral bad fortune sign of my family. I won’t take it out if not necessary. Now, I sell it to you at Two Yuan. It can eliminate disaster, and give you good fortune. How about? What happened? What’s up? Why? Why does he change? He, he becomes a statue. What’s wrong? Indecent! Indecent! Indecent! Indecent! Let me go! Indecent! Indecent! Who can help me? Indecent! Release, Indecent! Let me go. Indecent! Excuse me, do you have a lighter? No! Indecent! Who can help me? Indecent! Let me go! Let me go! A thief! Box! The man in front of you, The monk running on top of the train, is Qian Buer of Chuangyao Hall. Monk is a cant. It especially means the thief. Chuangyao Hall is exactly the name of a thief school. Different from other thief schools, they only stole the wealth of the bad persons. His junior fellow apprentice Zhang Lisan is exactly a grand thief robbing the rich and assisting the poor. Qian Buer got to know that, his junior fellow apprentice Zhang Lisan has been imprisoned by Charlie Detective Agency of Jiuhe City. He especially came to Jiuhe City to find out more information. Compared with the reputed grand thief, Zhang Lisan, Qian Buer is nobody. Run! Excuse me, who are you? Why are you chasing after me? Do you know Liu Heyi? He is the famous detective of the south. What’s up? I caught you on the first day of taking the post. Why didn’t you catch that lovelace? You stole his box, he will certainly look for you. Then, I can catch both of you. Where is the thing? Put it out. I didn’t take it. What’s the matter once again? I have something important to do! I want to go to the toilet. I can’t hold back. I can’t escape. Don’t play tricks. Charlie Wang Detective Agency? Is that the place where my junior fellow appreciate is imprisoned? Thanks, Just do it. OK! I know! Butterball, you caught Zhang Lisan, right? That’s a great achievement. But since we have no expert detective, our Detective Agency is still not emphasized. Don’t worry, president, the expert detective will come today. He was not here before, we were helpless. I know, so, be sure to serve the expert detective well. Yes, sir. Don’t worry, I will. Excuse me, do you know me? Are you You know each other? Liu Heyi? Yes. Then, have you ever seen him? No. Here you are. Are you Liu Heyi? Welcome, welcome, welcome! Expert detective, You finally come! Butterball always mentioned you, you are indeed the idol in our heart. The greatest hero in the world, deserve to be called as the expert detective. Really? It suits well, really handsome! Boss, there is something wrong in the fire deity temple. Ah? They said the statue was originally a person. We are not sure about it, so we want you to investigate in the first. If you have any clue, just report to us. No problem, no problem. But, why could a person transform into a statue? It’s true! I saw it personally. We all saw it. Right? Yes, yes. Exactly! Alas, don’t kick up a fuss. Look! He didn’t follow others’ suggestions, and smashed the statue of the fire deity. Look, he is punished by the god, and turned into a stone. All these fellows have smashed the statue of the fire deity. Will they turn into stones soon after? What can we do? It is more important to rescue the junior fellow apprentice. I should try to escape! Here is the ancestral bad fortune sign. Take it away! Is this a market? Is this a statue? Dad! Dad! Alas? Is this your father? No, the appearance is, but not the stone. What are you doing? What are you doing? Don’t smash it! But didn’t you say the statue is not your father? He is your father. I saw him turning into the stone. Yes! How could that be? He is my dad. If you smash it, my dad will disappear. Why did he turn into the stone? Boss, if you could solve the case, we will win both reputation and money in Jiuhe City. What do you think has happened? Dad! Take all them back! All of them! Come here! You! Come here! Take them away! Come here! Come here! Go, go, go! You are Su Ye. He is your foster father. Su Mu. You are an expert detective. You can certainly solve the case. Of course, look at this, Every document here is the unsolved strange and great case. They are all in front of your case. So, you have to line up! Then, how long shall I wait? Two or three years! So long? Then, My dad... Now that you are so anxious, I can give you a chance to jump the queue. I have money. I will give all the money to you. Only these. It seems that you are not so anxious. Expert detective! How can I not be anxious? It is not crispy! What fucking detective? Miss Su... Just ask for money. Boss, I was told that if the case could be solved, we would be rewarded. This is the material. It’s true. He doesn’t believe in it. All people have seen it. Yes! It just turned into the stone. Even the expert detective has no clue. Yes! We carried the statue back home. Nonsense! How could a live person become a statue? I don’t believe. Brother! Brother, what’s wrong with you? Itchy! Brother! Brother! What’s wrong with you? What’s wrong? Brother! What happened? What happened? Are you OK? Itchy! Really itchy! Do you know how much is the money reward? Yes, Five hundred yuan! Shall we accept the case? Of course! I heard that you caught Zhang Lisan. I was intended to tell you! I caught him! Good job! Hey, hey, boss! Wait! Look at the material! Zhang Lisan is a man with rich experience. He stole the money of the rich and sent to the poor. Three yuan for the poor each time. That’s why he gets the name: Lisan. Zhang Lisan is a dutiful man. His mother just lives in the Jiuhe City. He would jump off the tree house in the afternoon, and deliver some food to his mom. His only weak point is blood phobia, so we can easily catch him with a gentle touch. However, he refuses to say anything in the hearing. We can’t get the reward. A man with rich experience, right? I am going to interrogate him right now. Let me go! Let me go! You now Qing Kung. If I release you, you will fly away. You know, you will certainly confess in the police station. Damn you! Damn you! Sit down! You won’t tell me your thief partner. I know it is the rule, right? But a grand thief is not a hero, Right? Go ahead! Go! Why are you here? It’s none of your business! My junior fellow apprentice, do you know how much money you worth? Hum! Five hundred yuan. Here is the thing. I made a fake identity, but I would be discovered if I rescue you now. When I solve the case, I will give you one hundred yuan, OK? Give me one hundred yuan! Damn you, I will give you one hundred hits! I was originally intended to rescue you in Jiuhe City. God knows, why could I become a detective accidentally? Just wait for me! After we sharing the money, we can do everything we want. Go to hell! You don’t let me go, and you want to get the reward in the first. I hit, Hit! How dare you! Boss, boss! It’s too bad! Where is your partner? What happened? On that day, I really saw the strange thing in the fire deity temple. You should believe in me! Doctor Wang! Su Ye, why do you start to study this after having a learning trip? These are impossible things! My father has become a stone! Did you see personally? Doctor Wang, please do to the emergency clinic to have a look! Just wait here for me! What’s going on? Itchy! The doctor is coming! The doctor is coming! The doctor is coming! Help me! The medicine has been useless. No effect at all. They are becoming more and more serious. Really strange! Just hold on! I know you don’t feel well! Hold on! Hold on! Help me! What’s going on? Hold on? What happened? What happened? Tell me! Are you OK? Are you OK? Are you OK? Get up! Slow down, slow down! Let me help you get up! Release me! Let me go! What are you doing? Let me go! A little comfortable now! Relieved already! Are you OK? Don’t move! Liu! Liu! Liu! Liu, what’s wrong with you? Liu! Itchy! Really itchy! What? The virus has transferred! Itchy! What’s wrong with you? Help me! Help me! This is an infectious disease! Isolate! Isolate! An infectious disease! Run! It is infectious! Run away! You are infected! No, I’m not. No, I’m not. I don’t know! Stay away from me. Stay away from me. Fine just now! Stay away from me. Believe in me. Who asked you to shoot? I, I, I... We have no other choice! Come to help me! Death in every sense. We must survive. We rush out. rush out. You just watch them kill me. You said you love me on bed. Where is your hug? Stay away from me. OK! Let’s die together. I personally saw the entire process. Just in an instant! The person disappears. But you don’t have to be afraid now, because I have the ancestral bad fortune sign. I won’t take it out, if it is not serious. How much is it? Two yuan to you. Only two yuan! Remove bad fortune and increase good fortune. It is not expensive at all. It can save your life, and keep you safe. It is absolutely useful. Cheaper, please. Cheaper. One yuan! Run, run! Cheaper please! OK! Save us! All the workers have been infected! Follow me! It’s ancestral, so it is expensive. What’s wrong? Are you OK? Let me go! You! Go away! Hurry up! Follow me! Don’t you have the sign? Just stick the sign on them! I just earn money with it. It’s useless. They have the same symptom with my father! What can we do? Go! Get down! Hurry up! Get down! Down! Hurry up! Why is it so serious? I guess it is all because your dad has smashed the fire deity temple. But, his dad insisted on dismantling the fire deity temple. I have persuaded him, but he didn’t listen to me. Tell me, how could I earn the incense money after dismantling the fire deity temple. Each temple has its rule. As for me, I only do the business of the fire deity temple. So, before my dad turned into a stone, was there anything strange happened to him? You dad, seemed to be itchy at the beginning. Then, his body turned into the stone little by little. Really strange! No good harvest today. I have fishes. What fishes? A big white fish of 1.6 kg. Too many fish bones but less meat. Stew it. Feed several hundred of people. Powerful background. Come up! Excuse me! What do they mean? Argot of the black market, meaning two persons in three don’t belong here, with rather safe identity. Let’s go! Come on! Where are we going? I will lead you to one person. He will probably have an idea. Those people seem to have leprosy. This place is rather strange. But probably, we will find the solution of saving your dad! This is exactly the underground city of Jiuhe. Ordinary people won’t come here. After going through the hole in the left, and then passing through the three-surface stone, you will reach the market. What about the right one? This In the legend, it is the entrance of the hell. The blooming flower has two faces, mankind is also wandering between Buddha and evil. The left side is the market for mankind, and the right side is certainly the market for ghost. What it looks like? Nobody knows. It’s cheap, give it to you! Get more. Come on, drink some wine. I will serve to you. Come! You should come often. Go! What are you waiting for? You know, I have been lived here for so many years, but I don’t even know that there is such a busy world underground. Of course, people come for the first time will always have such feeling. Let’s look for my master. Who is your master? My master is exactly old fish who knows both things ahead and after. Don’t you want to know the things happened overground? My master will certainly know. Is your master so powerful? Of course! This way! Ah! My master Zhouyi Tianxiang, Xiazhi Acupuncture Pharmaceutical! Anyway, it's great! Master! Master! Master! My master disappears! Wine! Master! Master! Right! Mrs. Cat! Mrs. Cat! Mrs. Cat! Mrs. Cat! Mrs. Cat! Who is that? Mrs. Cat! Mrs. Cat! It’s me. My master disappears. Your master has sinned against someone. He shall probably hide in a girl’s house, or in the whorehouse! Impossible! My master couldn’t sin against someone. If he did, I should know. Who is she? She is my friend. Your friend? Such a pretty girl. It’s a pity that, he has no relatives in the world? How do you know it? Do you mean that my dad can not recover? How could you know her dad has become a stone? Didn’t you play the trick? Mrs. Cat is Master’s sister. There is nothing she doesn’t know. Mrs. Cat Could you please find a way to save my dad? It is not a disaster to your dad. It is a predestined fate to Jiuhe City. Mrs. Cat, what can we do now? Just for your master, I will help you. Go! This is a predestined fate. The dragon and snake of Jiuhe save Jiuhe. The ancient fish in Jiuhe is in the wine house. Your master is still alive. Just here. He knows the dragon and snake. Thanks, Mrs. Cat. Tell your master, I will eat him sooner or later. Sir! Boss! Boss! Did my master come to buy wine these days? No! He hasn’t come several days. Then, what is the time you met my boss for the last time? I can’t remember. Let’s ask somewhere else. Go! What’s wrong? Is there any other path? Yes or no? Go! Give me my box! Please don’t smash my booth! No! Go! Monster wants to meet you! Useless. You don’t have to find the curing medicine. The virus has been spread. Go to release all the blocked infected persons, let the virus spread all over the city. Wake up! Who are you? Master! Master, where did you go? I have been looking for you for a long time! Are you old fish? Hum! Then, where are we now? In the stomach of the ancient fish. It’s OK! Look! Stomach? Don’t be afraid! This is my house! Master! Why didn’t I know you still have a moving house? Of course for my safety. You know it is quite dangerous outside, I have to have several hiding places. Don’t dismantle my house! If you are the old fish, you must know how to save my dad. Alas, My dad has become a stone. He is a statue now. In addition, The workers in the stone are becoming stones as well now. I feel that it is quite similar to the serious lepriasis. Oh, by the way, I was almost infected. Fortunately, I escaped with them. We come here because we want to find a solution from you. The persons chasing after you are fellows of Wulian Sun. I hide here because I want to escape from him. Many years ago, there was a Xianghe Village in Jiuhe City. The fire burned everyone. The only young surviving Psychologically stimulated. Heart disease. Renamed Wulian Sun. except one young man climbing out of the fire. Joined the organization of lianhuaqing. They started all kinds of atrocities, commit all manners of crimes. To rebel against the government, He created the virus and triggered a new infectious disease, It's like a plague Now, the virus is spreading, and it is unable to be blocked. You have to hurry up! I will give you a silk bag now. You have to find this person, whose code signal is Miao Ren Shen Bei Liang Hu Lu. Qi Zhi Ying Xu Bu Luo Kong Don’t open it. Shouldn't take action now. This one can be opened after you encounter a person saving you. Guide you what to do next. Just take it. So, my dad can be saved, right? This will be a challenge to you! Geezer, then, how can we get out? Weren’t you swallowed by the big fish? A! Just vomited up? Really smelly. I know my master is also difficult until now. Boss, it’s me, it’s me. Why do you become this? Boss, in these two days, he is... Boss, run! Help! Help! Why is it so serious? They are infected through skin contact. When just get infected, they would have the appearance of drug addition As time goes longer, more parts will become the stone, until loss consciousness. because of the pains and sufferings in the body. It is unable to be controlled. Different persons have different infectious cycles. they can infect the disease to others, and then they can recover. It can relieve the pain, just a temporary relieving. It can not be covered. I will go back to the detective agency. Are you crazy? Detective agency? You can’t! All people there are infected. What’s the matter? I have left my junior fellow apprentice behind. I don’t know who has released the infected persons in the enforced area. Let’s be careful. Go to the third floor from here. Turn left and then march forward, it is the exhibit room. Your dad is there. You go with them. I will go to the hearing room. Be careful! OK! Why are you following me? Follow them! Junior fellow apprentice! Junior... You have been like this? Junior fellow apprentice! You go inside, I will guard for you outside. Junior fellow apprentice! Alas! Junior fellow apprentice! Junior fellow apprentice! It’s my fault! Dad! Dad! Dad! We were intended to get some profits. But we couldn’t expect to get you involved. If the master knows underground, he would blame me to death. If I knew it before, I wouldn’t be the detective. I do it for the five hundred yuan. You finally come! Junior fellow apprentice! If you don’t come, I will die here. You haven’t become a stone? I am locked here. You can’t come inside, let alone them. Then, what is on your body? The building is in so poor quality. Someone is running upstairs, all powder falls on my body. OK! Just wait here! I will help you out! How? Hurry up! I will believe in you for the last time! Qian Buer! Don’t move! Your father is the first stone person. At that time, when workers found that he turned into a stone, they touched the statue one by one. Such touch just infect the virus. Later, when the detective came, and carried your father to the detective agency. Then, the stone persons invaded by the disease in the hospital in the first batch are workers. The second batch is the detective. Then, the stone persons totally have no life sign at all. totally have no life sign at all. Junior fellow apprentice! Oh, it’s rather serious. Tell you the truth, the Jiuhe City is in chaos now. We have to escape in a huryy. How about my mom? I have to pick up my mom. Help! Help me! Are you OK? No, I am fine. Butterball. Exhibit room. Fine Butterball! Boss, I am infected! Go! Go! Nobody can save him! Go! Hurry up, hurry up! Hurry up! Go, go, go! Move the desk! Hurry up! Run fast! Go! Boss! Go! I can’t be saved anyhow!

It’s him who always places three yuan in front of the gate. He is really a great thief. All strength! Left! Left! Mom, why are you here? I was told that he was caught, then I came in the street to look for him. Nice! Son. Do you know Doctor Wang? He is my brother. You also know him. He is my friend? How is he now? He... We haven’t contacted with each other for a long time. This one can be opened after you encounter a person saving you. Guide you what to do next. Oh, yes! Where is the silk bag your master gave to you? Son, I am fine. Don’t worry! Fire deity village! What does it mean? Where is it? Oh, it seems that I have heard of the fire deity village. It is in the Jiuhe City. Ten miles in the southeast direction. Does your master suggest us to find clues in the fire deity village? The source is the fire deity temple. It is better for the doer to undo what he has done Open the door! Anyone? Open the door! Anyone? Where are you from? Granary! Wait! I have seen them! They were infected! No, I am not. I saw. What, no! My husband protected me. Really? How about let the child come in the first? I was protecting her. She is fine. Or else, I can go outside to have a look. No. It’s too dangerous. Who will be responsible for it if something happens? I have to make sure you are not sick to let you in, This is responsible for everyone in the house. I can prove to you I am not infected. I can prove to you! What are you doing? Let me go inside! Please, let me come in! I am not... I am not infected. If it weren’t you just now, they are in the room now as well. Are you a man? Pay attention to your attitude. I am your senior fellow apprentice. I really look upon you! Am I wrong? You are too selfish. selfish? Is selfish a fault? Was I the only selfish person just now? In such condition, The life of two persons for the life of all the people in the house. Will you be responsible in case? Detective, you shut up! I am not a detective. Yes, of course you are not. You are a thief. Stop pretending to be a hero. Thief always has the principle. I have no principles. Son, what can we do now? Mom, don’t worry! I am going to the fire deity village now, to find the solution. But, it has been blocked, how could you get there? I know an underground pipe to the outside! I will go with you! Hum! Although my dad... there are also so many people waiting for assistance. OK! Please take care of them. Be careful! Why, why, why... Why is you? I become this because of you! Wulian Sun developed a kind of medicine. You stole my medicine box, and splashed in the station. As a result, the virus spread in the whole city. Originally, after spreading the virus, I can hided in a safe area. Since I didn’t find the medicine, I was sent to the infected area, and then I became this. At most three days, all infected persons in the city will die. You You can’t escape as well. I spread the virus! Hurry up! Go! Get out! What’s wrong with you? Fasten the infected area with the rope, put off the virus spread. How? Can you endure? Why are you here? I figure out, I want to tide over the difficulties with all of you! Who are you on earth? Qian Buer! He is my junior fellow apprentice, Zhang Lisan. Junior fellow apprentice? At least, I am your senior fellow apprentice. This is the fate. Don’t worry. We will stop you being a stone. Let’s go to the fire deity village now. Here is a tablet. Fire deity village! No fire here! Who are you looking for? Now, the entire Jiuhe City is becoming the stone. We come for assistance. Yes! What is the name of the person you are looking for? Miao Ren Shen Bei Liang Hu Lu. Miao Ren Shen Bei Liang Hu Lu. Miao Ren Shen Bei Liang Hu Lu. Such a long name... No such person Here! Miao Ren Shen Bei Liang Hu Lu. Liang Hu Lu! Miao Ren Shen Bei Liang Hu Lu. Liang Hulu! Stop shouting. I am the head of the village. All the people in our village are engaging in making firecrackers. One firecracker will bomb the whole city. So, our village should have no fire at all. No fire here! You have broken our rules. Imprison them! OK! No, No, No. Wait, wait, wait. Stop! Dad! I know him! On the train, you helped me! Excuse me, do you have a lighter? It’s you! Tell your dad, we want to find Liang Hu Lu. Liang Hu Lu! Liang Hu Lu! Another saying... Are all villagers here? Yes! All are here! Then, do you have any special? Any special? All villagers are special? Indeed! More special! More special than all of them! More special! Am I special? Do you have any common people? Common! Who asked you to find the person? Old fish! Do you know him? Old fish! Yes! Old fish! Old fish! Him! Old fish is the benefactor of our fire deity village. He left an important person here, and asked us to protect him. We arranged him in the Yanxia Cave of the fire deity village. You must look for him! Right? He knows the code signal. He is the person who can save the whole city. Little child, do you have any capacity? Who are you talking to? We made a mistake. Let’s go! By the way, Where is Su Ye? Who locked her up? Herself. She is afraid she couldn’t control herself. Su Ye! Su Ye! Don’t touch! Help her up! Come here! Su Ye! What are you doing? Qian Buer! Qian Buer! It’s OK! What are you doing? We are going to find the solution. Really? Although it is only a child, we can take him to old fish. There will certainly be a solution. Old fish, he is my father. Your father? I am his apprentice. But I don’t know he has a child. He is in the stomach of a fish. Dad doesn’t allow me to tell others. Except those know the signal, I couldn’t believe in anyone. He is afraid that I would be involved. I know, so, you have been waiting in the fire deity village, right? Hum, But, when my dad came to see me earlier, he gave me this. Is this the pattern on the shipyard of the master? Why does this come to be like this? Be careful! Find it. Wulian Sun threatened my master with the safety of the fire deity village with the safety of the fire deity village. Wulian Sun forced me to develop the variant medicine. I was rather regret, so I developed the antidote secretly, made it into the stone and hang it in front of the little fish. This one! Have a try! Recovered! OK! Come! Come! OK! People can be saved! Watch out! Get up! The old guy indeed holds back a trick! Anyhow, the virus has already spread all over the city, you have no time to save the people one by one. The stone virus was a trick of you! Nobody can stop me! Where is my master? I knew my death earlier! After being cultivated for one thousand years, the snake would become the dragon. Qian Buer is exactly the dragon. My apprentice will certainly take him and find the antidote. The dragon and snake of Jiuhe is the destiny. You! You! You won’t succeed! You dare to develop the antidote secretly! If you don’t give me the antidote, I will raze the underground city. Dad, I have revenged. All of them will die. It’s impossible. I have to express my gratitude to you! You stole Panlong’s box and splashed the medicine on Su Mu. Su Mu and all people in the city are killed by you. The person being firstly infected is the mother body. It will become the stone in an instant in case of an explosion. All people touch it will become the communicating body. Only through continuous communication, the pain can be relieved. Is it true? It’s you who implement my revenge plan ahead of the time. These things are unknown by them, right? Yes It’s my fault. I am the source of everything. Now, I won’t escape. So, today, I only want to kill you on my own, and then, I will assume all the responsibilities. Impossible! These selfish people of Jiuhe City, they deserve it. Sister, sister! Mrs. Cat! The damned guy, they ruined here! Master, I will revenge for you. Go to hell! Banxia! Mrs. Cat. Interesting! Mrs. Cat. Mrs. Cat. Banxia! Banxia! I am going to find your master! Find... Mrs. Cat. Mrs. Cat. Mrs. Cat. Two thieves want to be heroes. Go to hell! Senior fellow apprentice Senior fellow apprentice Sorry! It’s my fault! It’s my fault! It’s all because of me! Why do you come out? The alley is not safe. I pick up a gun in the way. We have to leave. You come back! Where is Lisan? Lisan is fine! Don’t worry! That’s good. The infected stone persons have broken through the isolated area. The virus has spread in the Jiuhe City. The leprosy virus is the conspiracy of Wulian Sun. We have already found the solution. Really? Finally be saved? Be careful! OK! Look! Here! I am fine! I am fine too! We can be saved! Look, they recover! Great! OK! We are so lucky! No lucky! Qian Buer think of an idea. He ground the antidote into powder, and then put it in the fireworks. Zhang Lisan lighted the fireworks. The antidote was scattered in the whole city! Infected! Came into contact with scattered powder antidote! Can eliminate the virus. Successfully cured everyone. Great! We are saved. Master! We made it! Great! Excellent! We are saved! We are saved! There is an old Chinese saying, heroes should be judged by their hacking. Two thieves saved all the people of the city. Just as the saying of the forefathers, even if the wild snake in mud will be able to fly into the sky after cultivation. Someone would say he makes so much trouble, what hero is he? In my opinion, storytelling, singing or so are just for fun at leisure. We can review whether Qian Buer is meritorious or guilty. How could I make a conclusion? Then, shall I call you Liu Heyi or Qian Buer? Qian Buer has died! You are a hero! You donate all rewards! Do you want to be a real detective? Get rid of the cruel and pacify the good people! I! Junior fellow apprentice Boss! Boss! There is a young man named Liu Hengshun. He wants to worship you as the master. I couldn’t expel him. Go back and have a look! OK! Wait for me for a while!
