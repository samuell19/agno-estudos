They then set out... on the path of thievery and fraud. They think they will... win over this world and carve a place of their own Little did they know that there are the worst of thieves in the world... who are not just enemies of society... but of the nation and humanity at large An instance of this kind became the biggest lesson for Tara and Sitara... when they met the dreaded criminals, Cobra and Panther Sir, our soldiers are ready to take the guns to the base Load the guns quickly. We've got to leave But you have an appointment with Mr Subramaniam at 1 2 Plans have changed. For security reasons As you know, sir, no one except you has the permission to go inside He's on official work for our department He's responsible for delivery of the gun at the base But orders are orders, sir Major, the Captain is doing his duty. Orders are orders You can go ahead. l'll wait here, okay? What is the matter? - This is Dr Subramaniam's cabin, sir While l meet Dr Subramaniam in privacy, you will wait here We need proper security for this gun We have toiled for years to develop this gun Come, let me give you a demonstration lt has an inbuilt sensor which detects movements within a 10-kilometer range Our soldiers will be greatly benefitted in dealing with infiltrators Because we don't want the gun to fall in wrong hands... each gun has been given a different code-number Without the code-number, this gun will not function What is the code-number to operate the gun? Ml2 3853713 First sign the documents You've signed the document... but you haven't entered the password of this operation? You know very well, Ram Singh Without the password, you cannot take this gun away This gun... l am surely taking away You're here, sir? - Where else? This is my base You were in there a little while ago, and this is the only entry-point l've arrived just now. ln your presence ln my presence, you've already passed through sir You also had an officer of your department with you My brother has left with the gun. You can do what you wish He has only left with the gun. Not the code Without the code, that gun is worthless And l'll get the gun back... because you're with me You can't do a thing! Greetings, sir. - Welcome, Bahadur Singh What brings you to my place today? - l've come with a reason, sir l've come to warn you, sir. - Warn me...? A pair of thieves has struck terror. - Terror...? They hit upon such novel ideas for robbery... the police are left stunned. - Don't tell me! A few days ago, they got into a cupboard and robbed the whole house The whole house...? They rent a house for a few days... and sell the place, as if they own it Sell it away? - They pose as servants and... Sir... - Milk, or the yogurt-shake? The two of them... at your place? The way they've taken care of me, even my children haven't After they've taken care of you, they'll vanish with the loot! What do you mean? - They're conning you! They're the twosome l've been warning you about One is Tara... - The other is Sitara. l know l say... you've ruined all our efforts Even if a criminal wants to reform... people like you won't let him turn a new leaf l say... have you forgotten? - lt might hurt We had sworn it on your head that we'd work hard for a living That we'd never steal again That's just what we were doing, but you've told our employer about us You've snatched our livelihood. Where to...? l got a kick on the waist Sir, l wish to tell you something today lf these guardians of the law keep harping on cliches... people like us will keep going to the jails No, l'm not letting you guys become thieves You're staying here with me. - Sir, l will leave now But you'd better remain alert with them A fire... - he has started No, he hasn't l know you guys are reformed But tell me of your modus operandi as thieves... so l will remain alert with cheats in the future We first survey a locality. - Then? Then we get into the household which is most innocent and wealthy Then? - Then... we serve the master as his servants. - Like you've been serving me? And when we've won the confidence of our master... we lace his milk or yogurt-shake with a bit of sedative and... Such foolish people! Their yogurt-shake is laced with sedatives And they don't even get to know... Did he... get to know? The moron Ruined This man was out to reform those thieves But those thieves have put him to sleep l told you to remain alert But you will continue to sleep C'mon Tara and Sitara... your game is up Don't even try to escape. Else, l'll let you have it He's getting dramatic. - Looks like he wants to die Tell me something, Bahadur Singh Why're you always hounding us innocent guys? Because of you guys, l haven't had a wash in a week But l'm taking you to the cleaners. Nicely so! No more jokes, lnspector. Else, an innocent man will die That's Cobra, isn't it? - Yes, sir You guys know who you're messing with? Shut up! Else, l'll pluck your eye-balls out You speak as if you've got a reward of millions on your head! You're right. - Can't you see...? the cops and the thieves are making a deal? Go ahead and kill him. That's Cobra. The dreaded criminal There's a reward of 100,000 for catching him, dead or alive Landed us in trouble, haven't you? - You ought to carry a signboard... that you're Cobra. How would we know? There's a reward of 100,000 on his head Will we get it? - Sure lf l let you live to claim the reward Arrest all three of them Before l turn cold, let me take his blessings lt's Mr Cobra who's being presented in court And why're we going there? - That's the new style Hammer a nail into a block of wood, it'll sail with it in the waters Like Mr Cobra here. He's the engine... and we're the trailers. lf he runs, we run. For no reason For how many years do you think Mr Cobra will be sent away? Going by the way he looks and behaves, l think... you tell me how many years you're likely to get He's scowling at me. - ls he? Let me see, Brother Cobra Sure he's scowling l think there's a terrible storm lurking behind his silence Brother... don't be angry, we're kids. Give us a smile You guys are free Move it Lovely weather... - Shut up. l've had enough C'mon There's a car parked down there. lt'll take you to the highway Mike will... We don't utter names in the presence of strangers He was revealing our gameplan What's with him, brother? Why's he fallen down? My bullet got him. - We didn't even hear it When did it happen? - You fired yesterday, did you? Today. Want to hear it again? Don't move... l'll shoot Drop the guns, or l'll shoot Well? We call you brother and you turn out to be a snob? What have you been up to? What...? Are you going to talk or undo these chains? What's with the chains? l say, who's screaming? ls it the chains? - No, it's a leg actually The bullet hit him a little below the chains in the leg What the hell have you done? Cobra... forgive us! Was it a mistake? - What if it struck him 4 inches up? No one has survived. - Let me undo these chains Why're you shooting at me? - Not you, l blew the chains away So what do we do? - Run Where's my brother... where? Get up, sir. Police! Congratulations, sir. Cobra has been captured That's all right. But where have Tara and Sitara disappeared...? My job's on the line! And you... you call yourself a big criminal and you couldn't stop those guys? Get up How will he get up? He's got a bullet-injury in his leg Carry him on your shoulders and take him to the hospital Where will l go looking for them in this wilderness? Tara! Sitara! Lots of stuff they've collected Where are Tara and Sitara? - Don't you read the newspapers? Don't you watch TV...? Has there been a robbery in town? Has anyone robbed anyone...? There's peace and calm in the city What does that mean...? What? lt means my sons are at their in-laws (read jail). Tihar Jail Your sons have run away from jail and left me in a spot of bother What...? My sons have run away? Scoundrels! When you can't take care of my sons... why do you take them away for six months? They weren't guests! We took them away because they were thieves! And there l was... with a heavy heart l gave my darling sons to you! And you make them run away! Am l crazy to make the prisoners run away? They ran away on their own There must surely have been something lacking in your hospitality Else, why would my sons run away? They're my support in life Tara and Sitara. Now listen carefully, you ass lf my sons are not returned to me, l'm going to curse you You're going to fall to a criminal's bullets Even if you escape that, you'll lose your job That's enough! When l find your precious sons... l'll leave them here on my own. This woman is a tyrant! Tara, Sitara... he has left Darling mother... you were amazing Enough. You boys ought to read the writing on the wall... and slip cross the border. Do telephone me And don't come back, till l tell you to Here's some money. l collected it for bad times You're so sweet... you're so innocent... you're lovable... dear mother... our mother Mother, you've done so much for us. Know what...? Even if our real mother was here... - What did you say? Have l given you any less love than a real mother? Had your real mother been here, she'd have handed you over to the police... to prove her greatness. She wouldn't have shielded you, like l did But you boys always say such things to hurt my feelings No, mother... don't misunderstand us. What we meant to say was that... had it not been for you, we wouldn't even have been alive We know, the one who rears is far greater than the one who gives birth And you have brought us up. So please don't misunderstand us! All right. Run away as quickly as you can You only had the cops after you earlier But even Cobra's hunting for you now. He wants to have your legs broken Big deal! We're the ones who shot at his leg! Of course. But before he gets into another game... we'll start a new one. - By cutting ourselves down to size l say, hold this... l'll make enquiries about the train Relax What's happening? Posters for a circus...? A magician in town? Or is it a new movie? Right now, it's these two thieves who are making waves They've made lives miserable for the cops and the citizens in the city Want to take a look? - All right, let me see There's a reward for their capture. lf you catch them, you keep some... and give me some Sitara, l can hear the band being played for me! l say... - Look here l say, sir... is that your daughter? No, not my daughter. But you sure are my son-in-law Your blessings. - Bless you l have another son-in-law... where is he? l'm not telling you. - Don't tell me. But l know You can't live without each other. lf one of you is caught... the other comes forward to court arrest. Right?

Tara and Sitara are two bodies and one soul lf something happened to you...? - What's happening to me? Tell me, what would you have done if you were in my shoes? What's a jeep? l'd have hijacked a train for you! There you are, aren't you? - On the dot Sitara, let me tell you something today l respect you a lot, my friend. - Watch the jeep When we got to be friends... we spawned a thousand stories of friendship Friendship was a precious gift Every season was lovely They know... - They know... the whole world knows that... my friend...

This bungalow used to belong to them They're here for a few days, we asked them to stay over l don't allow strangers to stay in my house This house isn't ours anymore So how can the folks here feel any sense of belonging?

You've made yourself comfortable. - That's like us brothers, you see Even when we buy a pair of slippers, we properly check it out Can't say when we might use it. - One thing, sir Whenever you buy the bungalow, let me be your servant l'm very poor. l have a mother, two brothers and three sisters You've got to get them married? - Right, sir He's eyeing the bungalow. - Listen, arrange for some breakfast You won't forget, will you? - No way! l know you've got 3 mothers, 300 brothers, 3500 sisters! No, one mother, two brothers... - Get lost! Brother Tara... - Brother Sitara? We have a place to hide. - Right Till Cobra dies, let's hide in this hole You see something? - Great danger Ram Singh has not adopted us to take care of us till we're old We're his guests for a few days! - We aren't his guests, brother! You've seen only Ram Singh, not his sister She's so beautiful, and they're such a nice family l wonder why l mustn't marry her and live with them Live with them? What do you think? ls he the potter Chandan Seth to give his daughter's hand in yours? lt's Ram Singh! - Big deal! Just as we've got into his house, we'll get into his heart too Really? Know what Pinki? l'm very happy with your brother lt was great of him to let Tara and Sitara stay in your house For what Tara and Sitara have done, the house is nothing They deserve a place in our hearts Sitara's such a he-man. He's so brave Bunty wasn't saved by Sitara alone Even Tara risked his life to save him He's so brave. l'm surprised how he beat them up, even in a wheelchair With a brother like Sitara, what's a wheelchair... you can deliver the punch even from a bed! Why're you giving Sitara all the credit? l'm talking about both of them. - But l could hear only about one Because you've been talking about the other Oh yes! l forgot, l must leave now. l'm getting late for the college l've got to meet the doctor and ask him about Tara's legs But you stay here. You never know. Sitara might spring here My love... my beloved... my love... l'm your beloved... l'm a lover... l've given you my heart l'm a lover... l've given you my heart Give my beloved to me... l've pleaded with God, l've wept on every shoulder l have wept so much My love, l have given my heart to you Give me my beloved... l've pleaded with God, l've wept on every shoulder My beloved, l seek... at every beautiful twist love takes To my house she shall come some day, leaving everything behind You're the one who lingers in my breath You're the one l always think about l'm crazy about her... l'd tell her, if l met her... l'm your beloved Your beloved You're my lover... you're the one l have given my heart to Sweetheart... O beloved... my love... Where has is gone? What are you doing? Obviously, l can't swim in a bathtub l've been trying to commit suicide. - What? Yes, there must be a hilltop in your city? There is. Why? - So take me there... and give me a gentle kick, l'll fall off What are you talking about? - l have another idea Hold my face like this... and shove it in the tub. Hold it down firmly, with your foot Till l stop breathing, don't take your foot off l've made a lot of unsuccessful attempts at suicide Look at this book. lt has 250 ways of overcoming your disability You will be able to walk again, run again... and maybe even dance with me too. - Dance? Will l be able to walk again? - Certainly You mean, l can run...? l can take your hand and run?! Pinki's dress...? Why's it here? The lame-duck hasn't jumped her, or has he? Sitara... you're back early. - Early? l think l'm too late. - Not at all Give me an explanation. - Explain what...? She was here to cure a cripple! - Cure...? There you go! You're the elder brother and you push your kid brother? lt isn't two days since we got here, and you've gone so far ahead! l planned on going deeper... right to the altar Come to your senses! We're here to escape, not to play grooms! lf only Ram Singh saw what l did, he'd have made a real cripple out of you! What will Ram Singh do? l'm not entering his sister's life His sister's coming into my life! - Really? l smile to myself when l think how tickled l'll be... when his sister massages my legs. l can laugh already Tara, did you feel any pain? l felt something, but it wasn't pain No? You will now Did you feel any pain now? - lt wasn't pain And why're you smiling? - l smile because l see... how concerned you are about my cure You're putting your heart into it. You're leaving nothing to chance l think this stick is a fake With a little stick you're out to cure me, Pinki And so many big ones are broken already Look at that. - What? Sister, throw away that little stick. l'll use this whip on Tara's legs... and make him feel the pain! Out of my way! Brother, why's the whole family bent on curing me? Why's this guy charging at me? Ask him to hold on l can't. When Ram Singh can't control him, how can l? l've never taken such a huge stick! This is a well-oiled stick! lt has squeezed the life out of several men! One blow with this stick and... - Handle him, brother He's mad He's a monkey! There goes My leg... Why're you hitting me? l was only curing you! l was curing you too Give him a banana. - Yes. For extra energy Here you are No one can cure him! - Hush. You mustn't say such things l'll surely be cured... with love l say, Pinki... Sitara? How are you? - Wonderful l say, what are you doing with such fat books? l'm trying to find a new cure for Tara A new cure for Tara? - Because he can't walk l'm trying to find a cure that will help him move around Listen to me. Tara's actually hungry for love No amount of beating can ever cure him So what am l to do? Could you suggest something? You ought to produce the heat in him lgnite a fire in his body. So that he burns in the fire... runs helter skelter, cries, howls, jumps around... you get me, don't you? - Yes Tea Tell me something, Chhotu. How do you start a fire? With petrol Start the fire with petrol, and he'll race around like a car All right That's the shock-therapy! There's mischief in the air today... it's terribly mischievous today... A storm is coming That's my line... stop singing Pinki... why're you watering the place around me? lt isn't water. lt's petrol l use my hands on the wheelchair, why use petrol? lt isn't to run your wheelchair, it's to make you run Me...? - This is shock therapy They find a new therapy for me every day l wonder what she'll do... she won't start a fire, l hope The dark clouds move in the skies... every bud... casts a suspicious glance at me My God! Escaped! Escaped, finally! You ran away even before the cure could work! l couldn't help it... you don't understand Where do you get such great ideas from? As if it was my idea. - Whose was it? lt was your brother Sitara's So he's the brains behind this sight? Where's the genius? Where's he? Sitara, l feel great love for you today So, embrace me. - Let me complete my line This is Pinki's book. lt has 250 cures for my impairment And you gave her an extra tip! l merely told her to produce the heat of love in your body The heat of love is something... and setting the body on fire is yet something else She was setting my body on fire. - On fire...? Hide me somewhere... she seems to have found another cure Hold on. Let me bowl her out. - No... l'm bowling her out Can't l at least hold her? - Go ahead Maintain the distance My enemy... this is a beautiful moment My foe... a beauty stands for your love Take me in your embrace... think of nothing else You're a woman, a mischievous girl... l'm an innocent boy l'm a priest's son, related to those who worship You're a big name...

Only because of his will power... he can walk and move around today. Read it l don't want to read it... - For inspiration.

Wait there... shoot him in the leg! Not his legs, l've just treated his leg Don't you think our life has changed, ever since we've come here? lt has changed, no doubt. We haven't committed any robbery... nor theft, nor picked a pocket. - That's not what l'm talking about l'm talking about the moonlike beauty. About Pinki, that is She picked me up from the wheelchair and transported me to her heart l say, Tara. Priti's made a place for herself in my heart Why don't we live here then? Don't you think this is a much better life than the one we led earlier? What did we have anyway? Running away from the cops... and Cobra? - Don't even talk about Cobra! He's bitten us black and blue. - l say, brother We'll swim across this river of love Let's kick this wheelchair together! 1 24... 1 25... 1 26... What news have you brought from Ram Singh? Have you had enough of the cells... that you've called me out for a thrashing today? Even if you change the location, you'll ask the same old questions Your first question: Where is the ammunition you stole from the army? Your second question: Whom have you sold the ammunition to? Third question: Where is your hideout? Right...? - You forgot my fourth question Where are your friends hiding? - That question, l'll surely answer My friends are close by Plans to rescue me are also in place The day l'm free... you'll be finished, Ram Singh l'll give you the opportunity right now Run away from here and finish me You think you're very brave? Try crossing the main gate and prove it l'm the only one standing between you and your freedom No one will interfere With the handcuffs? - Release him But remember something. lf l catch you in the first attempt... you're getting ten blows. The second time... five ln the third attempt, you won't be able to take even one blow Go on Soldiers... this is Ram Singh. Nobody will stop Panther Let him go anywhere he wants to Traitor! You threaten a soldier with death? That was four blows, Ram Singh. Just one to go, okay? Hit me. - The final blow, eh? Ladies, listen... l'm a very poor man l have a mother, three sisters and two brothers All three have got to be married. How would Tara and Sitara be... for two of my sisters? - Not good at all What's wrong with them? - Go and find other suitors l'll do that if l can leave the house. You won't let me go anywhere By the way, why did you say that, Priti? Obviously! He spoke of getting my Sitara married to one of his sisters! Have you noticed his personality? He's so handsome With the glitter of gold... with the sparkle of silver... it was when the juice of roses was extracted... my beauty, my love... was created Those who look at me, keep looking... l'm the one they always think about Take me in your arms, my love... make love to me A bit concealed... the mischief of your beauty... it was when the juice of roses was extracted... your beauty, my love... was crafted Psst to you! Back again! This is Cobra speaking. - Lovely voice. Call for you Lovely voice...? Must be my girlfriend Listen to the romantic chat l have with her Where are you, darling? - This is Cobra Which cobra is this? ls it the one we defanged... and made a public mockery of? - This is Cobra, your father! lt was Cobra calling. - l know Why did you give it to me then? - l was scared l understand. l'm scared too. - Let's sit down Could he still be on the line? Still holding Tara, Sitara... please come and sit down Have something to eat, why're you standing there? lf you're not hungry, could l have some juice served to you? What's the matter, son? You boys look worried No worry... it's just a bit of tension Actually, both of us had the same nightmare last night A nightmare...? What was it about? - We saw a snake... a cobra A venomous cobra. - That's a very bad omen When you have a nightmare like that, it means your enemy's after you But you needn't worry. Just find a small snake and feed it some milk How about feeding Chhotu instead? - Good idea The headlines: The dreaded terrorist Cobra has escaped from police custody Cobra has escaped from jail on several occasions earlier... and the police are looking for him Know when a terrorist breaks jail? - When? When he wants to extract revenge from his enemies l saw it in Sholay Gabbar runs away from jail... and takes revenge from his enemy. Cobra's taking revenge too What's wrong with him...? He hasn't even had any lunch He swallowed fear at breakfast But why are you trembling? - As if l'd be afraid! Brother! Cobra is here! - Hit him! What are you doing here so early in the morning? That's my question. Why are you sleeping here, instead of the bedroom? Moron! We are guests and guests can sleep anywhere What are you doing here? - Mr Ram Singh is leaving... for the outpost for a couple of days. l came to clean the jeep And these guys sleep just anywhere Cobra wouldn't have come here, for fear of confronting Ram Singh But if Ram Singh himself leaves, what happens of our safety? Say something. - Know what? l have an idea. - Shoot Why don't we go to the border with Ram Singh... and cross the fence when we get the opportunity? What made you plan a trip to the border with me? We wanted to ask you something about our character You ask him, brother. - Me...? No, you ask him Go ahead and ask... what is it? Move it! Move! Freeze! Get in! Here they are Two more guys are coming Here you are lt won't go off. - Try again lt went off, but it didn't hit him The bullet hit his leg! From your face... take off the mask... dear sir Let the veil be, do not take it off lf the veil is taken off... - Big deal? You've got a bullet in the leg and you're singing songs? What's so special about him? You've shot me in the leg! You shot him in the leg again! - lt's his mistake actually His face has value in police circles and the public But how will the public know what's behind the mask? Let me drop the curtains on your life! You don't even know... your days are getting over The impossible is about to happen... start counting your days One, two, three, four... - Five, six, seven, eight... add it up to eleven, buddy boy One and one is eleven... my friend l say... - Tell me Why has Ram Singh brought us here? Looks like we're getting the huge reward on Cobra's head l've always thought that the two of us are great men But time has always prevented our success With times changing... - Ram Singh will change too Welcome, Ram Singh. What do you want to ask now? Not ask, l've come to tell you something What? Your brother Cobra, who wanted to kidnap me and have you freed... has been killed l want to tell you something more lt wasn't me or a soldier who killed him He was slain by a couple of brave civilians l've brought them with me, so you can see... our civilians are no less than soldiers ls this a death sentence for us? - l don't know We always find happiness to protect sorrow l don't know. l'm fed up Brother Panther, please don't pay attention to what Ram Singh says Whatever happened was an accident. - lt sure was You could say brother Cobra was destined to die And isn't God kind? He snatched one brother from you... and gave you two brothers instead. - Brothers. Buy one, get one free Brother Panther, please be patient l will be patient But your brother wasn't patient. No wonder the scoundrel died! The poor guy. - Oh yes The day l escape from here... l'll dig your graves We're talking of patience and he's talking of graves Hold it. You might puke on his face Why're you so sad? Give me a smile What do you think of that car? Let me take you for a drive. - Where? Wherever destiny takes us Let's think it over again. Will we be able to live without Pinki and Priti? No, brother don't! We don't want to listen to the tinkle of Pinki and Priti's bangles We must heed the threat of Panther Panther, who is caged... he's baying for our blood Turned your mind, didn't l? - lf l say something... you'll lose your mind too - What? The car is gone We've lost the dough, but the goddesses are here Let's forget what is gone and appreciate what's coming our way For beauty, we burn in the fires of passion Like wax, we melt We're crazy, we sway We slip up and steady ourselves There's no one quite like us... my love... One and one make eleven... my love Tara! Sitara! Come on out! What was that? Lightning? Thunder? Or, has the roof come off? What's up, son? What happened? - l'm going to decide this today Decide what? - About Tara and Sitara's lives You guys think l don't know anything about you? l know every thing. And today, l've discovered your secret too l say, Tara... looks like the lid has been blown off our bank robbery Stand right here What are you girls doing there? Come here Hurry up Lovely couples You think no one saw you dancing and singing? Every time l left for the border, l always worried... what would happen of my family, if something happened to me But l'm not worried anymore. Even if something happens to me... l know Tara and Sitara will look after my family l can't believe my luck that l find such boys right at home l'm so happy that you've finalised a match for Priti and Pinki Shouldn't you ask Priti's parents too? What's the problem? Take mother and go over to their place They won't find boys like these, will they? l'm so happy. lf Ram Singh has sent the proposal... it must be from a decent and high ranking family That's all right. But won't you introduce the boys to us? At once. Tara, Sitara... don't feel shy Come here l say... greetings The brothers with six bullets each The same height and looks... they'd look the same with beards There were these scoundrels who robbed my bank These boys bear a striking resemblance to those fellows We look like scoundrels and criminals to him, although we're well dressed lmagine what he'd say if were were dressed in kurta-pajama! l can't tolerate this... - But l can tolerate it We don't want a proposal like this one! - Let me go ahead, if you don't want it Listen sons... l was talking about those two scoundrels One of those scoundrels looked just like you He was talking of running away with my daughter Why're you calling us names again and again? l told you we must leave. - l'm abusing those two chaps But we're offended. - Why? Obviously. We look alike. - l see Now tell me, which one of you is the thief? Both, in fact l want to know who's the thief who stole my daughter's heart? Who's my son-in-law? l'm the one Mr Ram Singh sent. - l see Let's hurry up. l'm getting late. - This is my watch! lt's mine! With a T for Tara! - No, T stands for Tiku lt's Tara! You'll now say this S is yours This S is my wife's ! - S stands for Sitara Tara and Sitara. - Strange coincidence We bought them. We got the receipts too Come, let's sweeten our tongue. - After bitterness comes sweet Come, my boys We know, you make very good porridge, don't you? Also cauliflower pancakes! - How did you get to know? How...? How many times will you ask...? We know everything This is the hall, there's the bedroom, and a bathroom with a commode The safe's over there. - And a table, on which... Hold it! Let's discuss it with Mr Ram Singh and finalise a date for the wedding Your car keys, sir Brother... - l say? lt's a surprise! Found it! Why's he rolling over the bonnet? Found it! The car!

Carry on Why've you come to meet me so late in the night? l couldn't help it. l've found my heart after ages Get a hold on your heart... it's only for a few days No way. l've spent so many days without it l'm not letting it slip out of my hands today Go away, before someone comes here. - Wide open What? - Doors... here and there Who's that...? Who is it? Tara and Sitara! What are you doing here? - This bag fell down. We're putting it in This is the bag in which those thieves stuffed the loot! You boys have found my money! You've found the bag! You're like Gods to me! Tara, Sitara... the two of you are great! Give us the bag. - You are great guys! You're angels!

This is love only in name What good is this joy? When you're heart-broken, left in the lurch When your trust is betrayed... The love in your eyes is make believe Every drunken lover has gone Those special people are no more Don't even talk of folk singers... nor those who set examples in true love lt isn't about love, or the beloved... your love is treacherous Love... Brother, l don't believe it. He looked like Cobra Was he Cobra himself? What a shameless man! We threw you off the cliff... and you still climb up? - There was water down there...? There was nothing. God saved me And now, you guys will do just as l ask you to Why would God save him? - Ask Him Why would we listen to you? We have always done the bidding of only one person Our mother! - Your mother? Talk to her Let me talk Mother...? Why are you crying? My son, these scoundrels have kidnapped me and brought me here Where are the two of you? - Brother, Mother's crying Mother... are you all right?

Number one... an entry into Ram Singh's house l leave it to you to introduce me as your paternal uncle or maternal Number two: l want to change my appearance l'm sick of this beard and l could be recognised too Where was the need to bring all this? - lt was necessary lt's a token of goodwill. And l'm no stranger l'm the boys' maternal uncle. - Uncle-snake-in-the-grass He bites You boys didn't tell me you had an uncle too? How could we? He sprang before us only yesterday When they were little children, l went away to Africa The tan has ruined his looks My nephews are all praise for you They say you've caught the worst of criminals Tell me something. Criminals are normally held in jails Where do you keep them? - How can you ask such questions? Have some sweetmeats. - l wasn't asking... about anyone in particular. l only asked where they keep the criminals Some more, uncle. - Let him ask, he's your uncle We hold dangerous criminals at the Head Quarter's special cell Special cell? You must have very tight security then? Security? They have guns, grenades... like this one You mean even my nephews can't get there? No. - Why not? They're our heroes, they've saved my life ln any case, Tara's going to marry my sister Everyone there knows him. He can go there whenever he wants to You mean, l can't go there. - No Why not? During duty hours, relatives can call on their folks at work Wonderful l have another question, Ram Singh... - Try this, uncle l'm sorry, by mistake l gave you a chilli! Bless you... but l love chillis. - Really? So have another Enough... - Here's one more Try another Chhotu, you've brought uncle today? - He wanted to see the regiment Go ahead and show him around.

Nothing's happening to you till you're with me Come straight after me. Don't turn anywhere...

He's the criminal whose brother my nephews have killed! He has threatened to come out of jail and... Not to worry, Uncle. He can never escape Not only do we have very tight security... the keys to the cell in which he's locked is always in my custody lt's safely kept in my safe at home Caught you, didn't l? - What do you mean? l know why you're secretly moving around at this moment What for? - To steal Steal...? - Afraid, aren't you? But you won't find anything there. - Where ? ln the kitchen. You're hungry, aren't you? You're hungry, right? - Yes l'll go and cook something. - Hush!

He'll fall to the security's bullets The bloody... - Rat! Not rat, the bloody... - Rat! Yes... rat! - No, my boys lf l die, who'll give you the whereabouts of your mother? Tell us something... where did you disappear in the middle of the night? To have this key made. - lsn't that a key we heard of? You mean we saw it earlier. - We've broken so many locks Must be the key to one of them. - This is the key to Panther's freedom Why has he thrown the key in our face? Explain this... why have you thrown the key in our face? l'll tell you. Because... why did you throw it? With that key, you're going to free my brother Panther tonight Why will the two of us free your brother? Because if you refuse to do that, the Sun will rise tomorrow... but your poor mother will not see the new dawn You're a bloody... - Rat! We'll do it for you... let's shake paws! Lower the beam. - Tara? Can't be you in both places, can you? The officer's here, open up quickly Raise the barrier. Quick Mr Ram Singh's car? - He has just arrived At this hour? Must l awaken him? - With love Shall l? l say, brother! Brother Panther... He's not reacting, he's not dead, is he? Say nice things... let me try Brother Panther... you're not dead, are you? You're the ones who are going to die. At my hands You can't escape Tara and Sitara? We're helpless Open the handcuff l've found a truck driver. We've got to leave in an hour Where are we going? - Wherever the truck takes us You know, we have no place of our own. - But... we've ended up doing something very horrible What happened? What is it, Mother? What happened, Mother? - l'm responsible for what you did To save my life, the two of you have risked your lives Even my own children wouldn't love me so much Why are you harping on that? You're hurting our feelings Have we loved her any less than our own mother? Listen to me, Mother. What's one lifetime... we could sacrifice ten lifetimes for you What is the matter? - We have some questions for you, sir l'm sorry, l can't talk to you We're told you've been suspended Two wanted thieves lived in your house and you didn't even suspect... their mission was to rescue Panther? You're such a big officer... you hold such an important post... how could you be deceived, sir? Apart from being an officer, l'm also an lndian We lndians have a huge weakness We're very emotional When a poor man comes to our door, we share our food with him... without even finding out whether he's hungry or not When someone comes seeking shelter... we give him shelter in our house, without finding out... what lies in his heart l was blind to have wished to marry Tara How was l to know that the man l wanted as my life-companion... would ruin my brother's life some day To save their mother's life, Tara and Sitara had Panther released... but it was poor Ram Singh who had to bear the punishment As someone truly said, he paid for the sins the boys had committed What are you doing...? What? You were the one who always lent us courage And we stand by you today. We are with you Dad, whenever l didn't do well at my studies... or was found lacking in sports and games... you were the one who always told me, A soldier's son must never give up lf the one who gave me hope himself gives up... what will happen of us? - My son... your father never gave up, nor will he ever No enemy has ever escaped my eyes What l regret is that those two enemies lived in my own house... and escaped my scrutiny No, sir... l'm the guilty one! They made me tell them everything about the family l'd rather you shoot me, sir! - Chhotu! l'll kill those who have betrayed all of us Bastards! Whom did the bullet hit? - Not me Tara, we came here to explain our situation to him But he's shooting at us even before we can speak l think this crisis that goes on and on in our lives... Mr Ram Singh, if you could hear us out before you shoot at us? l want to listen to nothing! Nobody moves! Else, l'll shoot Madam, you step here... it's a request You come here, brother You're kidnapping me...? - l swear it on God! Nobody moves! Else, l'll shoot the old lady! Dad! Save Grandma! - Have patience Fatso, not even your father can save your grandma! You know what that means? Not a word against Dad! - Patience Sir, even if l die, l'm going to fix these guys! Cut that bloody crap! You have a mother, two brothers and three sisters You're going to die without getting them married? Not my Mother... - Your sisters will remain unmarried l'll see how you don't get your mother married! No tricks, please. - No smartness... no l'm not playing any tricks. l'll do just as you say Only let my mother go See? lt kills you, doesn't it? That's how mothers are Just as your love for your mother makes you helpless... the two of us were helpless too. - True Cobra had kidnapped our mother. He asked us to have Panther freed Had we not had Panther freed, the scoundrel... The bastard! - The sonofagun... the bloody owl... - The ape! Come to the point. - He'd have killed our mother How could we give death to the mother who gave us our lives? Don't cry, Tara... Give me the gun. - What's the problem? Mr Ram Singh, we enacted this drama to make you see the truth lf you still don't trust us, take this gun... and shoot us! - What are you doing? lf you must give the gun to someone, give it to the mother... she has a mother's heart! And Ram Singh is only her son Mr Ram Singh, please forgive us Circumstances have driven us to commit these bad deeds But we're not bad human beings. - Mr Ram Singh... we've never wanted to ruin anyone's family Give us just one chance We're the ones who set Panther free. We'll be the ones to bring him back That's not all. Let me tell you, Mr Ram Singh The respect and the happiness your family has lost because of us... we brothers will restore to you. - That's not all Just give us one more opportunity. That's all there is to it l see truth in what you say Go on. l give you an opportunity Pinki, l saw your interview on television You said that you're blind Had you been blind, where would you have found a handsome man like me? l have a request... please accept me No? She's willing, because she's shy. - Don't tell me! Please telephone Priti and tell her that Sitara has turned a new leaf And do tell yourself too, that your Tara has also turned a new leaf One moment l called you a fatso. - But he is a fatso Brother, we made tall claims and spoke impressive lines in there But where are we going to look for Panther? You played the lion from Punjab in there You spoke of restoring the family's happiness and honour Can't help it. lt's the Punjabi blood which is forever on the boil But what are we going to do now? - Brother... that was the way mother showed us A way out of this, mother will show us too Mother! Tara, Sitara... the two scoundrels... - What are you saying, Mother? This is the place those two scoundrels brought me to Amazing! She has brought us to the enemy's den! That's how a mother is. - Enough This is no time for emotions, it's action time Go and keep your promise Go and inform Ram Singh. ln the meantime, we'll fix these guys Watch it! Mother! You've learnt to drive? Mother has learnt to drive, brother. - That's how a mother is Right l'm leaving your country, so l thought l'd say bye to you one last time You did throw your weight around in that uniform You will now bow your head out of shame all your life You asked me many questions in custody But Panther has the last word Have you set the landmines? - Yes And the bombs? - Yes sir Not a trace of evidence we leave behind We've loaded the stuff. So let's move Stop the van! Chase! l'm so happy today Without any bloodshed, or doing anything wrong... we've done something great for the country l'm so happy! - Drive the van! l feel like crying. - Concentrate, will you? Overtake the van! Hold it! Right or left? Where do we go? - This is the first time... we've done something right, so take a right That guy's gonna fall l'm very excited today. - Why? Ram Singh will happily get us married. After that... we'll have kids from Pinki and Priti. - Concentrate on the wheels! What do l take now? Right or left? l'm even more excited. - No excitement. Drive the van! Listen... - No, drive the van l say... have we returned to the same place? You kept saying right and brought us to the wrong place When the time is right, you come to the right place Your time isn't right. Ours is Get the clowns Strange story... it begins and ends What destination... - You can't sing! Not you! Who told you to suggest so many rights! You were the one who was driving. - And who asked me to take right? He couldn't understand, nor could l... What destination...? - Not you! You can't sing! Skip the nonsense. - No nonsense, you don't know This chap creates the trouble and lands me in the soup l create the trouble? - Oh yes Brother Panther, ask brother Cobra who shot him in the leg lt was him! - One moment Where was the need to say that? Landed me in trouble again Even if l shot at you, who gave the gun to me? lt was him! - One moment! Where was the need to say that? All right, never mind Ask him who gave him those kicks and took him to the corner? lt was him! - One moment... l forgot what l had to say... where was the need to say that? Oh yes, even if l pushed you around... who was the one who gave him the final kick Who was it? Who kicked you? Who kicked you? Both of us had kicked him. Both of them had kicked me. - l'm not sparing them! Get them! Where has the grenade disappeared? - Why didn't it explode? lt hasn't gone into a coma, has it? There... gotcha! Kick it. lt's been years since we played soccer l'm David Beckham! - No, l'm David Beckham! lt's me! - Me! What are they up to? - They're playing with the bomb!

Also for the first time, we have done something good But there's something piercing my heart What? - Ram Singh's family... made no attempt to stop us! You're leaving without telling me? - As if you'd have stopped us l could've dropped you at the station in my jeep We don't need any jeep. - We can walk also He's offering us a lift! l've arranged a mare for you For the first time ever Tara and Sitara realised... that good company could reform the worst of them When the power of one and one helped humanity and the nation... they had found their wives, a family and a comfortable life But old habits die hard. They wouldn't guarantee otherwise
