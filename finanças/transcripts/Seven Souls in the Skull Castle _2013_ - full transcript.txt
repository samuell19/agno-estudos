TENSHO YEAR 18 In order to unify the remaining states, Toyotomi Hideyoshi advances East to gain control of the Kanto region. The opposing Hojo army strengthens their defense in return. The world was about to return to a period of war and chaos. In the west of the Kanto region. Reporting! Odawara Castle bids us to enter Hachioji Castle and fortify its defenses! Prepare to move out! Stop right there! You are the army of Hojo Ujimasa? Who's that?! Who are you bastards?! Who are you?! You Hojos strut about as masters of the Kanto region. But you bear the blame for this war. And now that Regent Hideyoshi comes to pacify the Kanto region you build up your defenses? Have no fear. There is nothing for you to do here. Either return to Odawara and hide away there… Or surrender yourselves to us! Nonsense! Who are you? We are the Six Legions of the Demon King Tenmao's Kanto Skull Corps. The Kanto Skull Corps?! Who are you?! The spirit of the Demon King… I am Tenmao. The Kanto region will not be ruled by the Hojo clan or by Toyotomi, but by my Kanto Skull Corps! Silence! Whoever you are, you will regret standing in our way! Tenmao. These fools do not know our strength. Fine. Do as you will with them. Tell those Hojo fools, the Kanto region now falls to the Sixth Realm. It is no longer the vessel for Hojo's ancient wine. The Hojo are finished here. A messenger needs no arms. Begone! Shogen, is the castle finished? As you commanded. Good. The time is ripe. Go, Six Legions! Understood. Let this plain burn in the flames of Tenmao! And tell the Monkey of Naniwa he has but one foe here… I, Tenmao of the Sixth Realm! Come, Hideyoshi! I await you at Skull Castle. Listen up! Take everything of value! Kill all who resist! Are we evil?! Do you hate us?! If you are evil and strong, join us and find glory! What we loot from you can be yours if you are one of us! Remember this! We are the Kanto Skull Corps! Join us and find paradise. Oppose us… and find hell! Whoa! Don't kill the women, Yuken. I know that. -Hold it there, bastards! -Bastards! -The hell is the Kanto Skulls Corps?! -Skull Corps?! Tormenting old folks and even women and children! Get outta here! Raise havoc in the Kanto region, and we won't… forgive you! Aren't we brave! You're going to play tough with us? Not just play tough. We're going to kick butt. Everywhere I look, fools! Not fools! The Rowdies of the East! Crying children fall silent! We are the wild ones! More like "the mild ones." Get 'em! You plan on taking me on without a katana? It's time you learned your limits! You talk too much. I wouldn't sink so low as to draw my katana against villains like you. Not me… No-draw Hyogo. B-Boss! Guys! Weak friends… such a tragedy! Don't laugh! I'm only here because they are! Wait, Yuken! Well, kid? Want to join the Skulls Corps? The Kanto Skull Corps wants hot-blooded men like you. We could kill you or you could join us and set the world on its ear. -You may choose! -What?! The Kanto Skull Corps is fun! You can go crazy! Enough! I am a warrior of the East whatever may come! -Boss! -I help the weak and subdue the strong in this world gone mad! You're so cool! Virtue is a line that can't be bent. A coward who would favor their own life among the Rowdies of the East? There is none! There could not be! Oh, there is! Me! Sango! Die if you want. I'm joining the Skull Corps. You traitor! A traitor I might be, but not to myself. I'll say it. What I treasure the most is… life. My own life. I only need… love. Love for myself. So, my name's Sango. I'm pretty green, but… Nice to meet you. Sango! And what about the rest? So the rest of you have decided to die here. "Sango," is it? Kill them. It's a test to join the Skull Corps. Do it. But… Kill them or be killed. -Got it. -Jeez, you bastard! Don't hate me, Hyogo. It's the times. I won't, but you won't kill me! Don't try it! Or these villagers you're here to protect will meet… a painful end. To bond in blood, and bleed those who defy us is the way of the Kanto Skull Corps! Do it, Sango! Huh? Aw, it got dirty… You know him? -Not me. -What about you, Boss? Please stay hidden. You look good. -Hello. -Hello. Who are you? Well, I'm just your average… meddler. I've been watching all this, and you're pretty mean, Kanto Skull Corps. I can't stand by while you mistreat delicate women and powerless young men. Big talk! Thank you. How about it? If you value your life, get out of here! Retreat! Retreat! Who are you?! I don't really wanna tell you. Just call me Sutenosuke. Remember this well, Sutenosuke! Come back two days ago! Don't ever come back! You dum-dums! Right? Wait for me! Boss! Way to hold out, guys! Hey, you there! Hey! You with the iron pipe. The iron pipe. Oh. Good thing you didn't get hurt. Consider your own strength before you start trouble. Who asked you to help?! Treating us like a bunch of weaklings! Don't underestimate us! Don't underestimate us! Before you stuck your nose in, we were just about to… …turn it around! The only thing rowdy about you is how you talk! -Is that the Kanto way? -Yeah! In us flows the blood of warriors! We are the Rowdies of the East! I am their leader, No-draw Hyogo! Hey! Listen to me! Oh. It would seem these girls have nowhere to go home to. What? Their houses have burned down and their families slaughtered. "Eastern Skulls," was it? They do some horrible things. Damn those Skulls! Strutting round like they owned the place. But some think they're pretty cool. Fool! What's cool about them? As long as you feel that way, find these girls a place to sleep tonight. Right! Don't worry. Leave it to me. You're all talk! Come with me. Where? Mukai Village. They'll be taken care of there. Mukai Village? Isn't that the biggest brothel in the Kanto region? Yep. You've got sharp ears. That's exactly right. But not just that. It's also salvation for the Kanto region. -Salvation? -Yeah! Alright! We're outta here! One-two! So Mukai Village is our salvation, huh? I see. Well, why not? The cares of this world and the ties that bind me here I have thrown away, and thus I call myself… …Sutenosuke! What a cheapskate you are! Oh, my! Well, well! Hello there, samurai! Come this way for some fun. Come on! Girls, we have a customer! Welcome! I see! Mukai Village certainly lives up to what the rumors say. Oh, please! Hey, Isa! Bring this gentleman a bottle of sake. Make yourself at home. You're late, Oyoshi. It's past noon. Sorry! How was last night? No good! Not a single customer. -She was in a foul mood. -That's right! Really. I shouldn't drink so much. Hey! He's a thief! Grab him! He stole a riceball! Alright! Take this! And that! Hurry! I got him! -I won't let you go! -This way! -Damn! -You're not getting away! See ya! I got him, Omina! Thank you! Let go! Settle down! What a loser! All this fuss over one riceball! -You don't lose anything! -I sure do! I lose a riceball! Calm down, Omina. That's my lunch! I'm not going to let him steal it. Give me your knife, Isa. I'll kill you! I'm going to kill him! Don't come this way! -Get 'im! Get 'im! -Teach him the value of rice! Damn it! Omina, that way! No, hurry! Stop! Mind your business, samurai! Move! Calm down, will you! Calm down a minute and think! A man's life, or a riceball, which means more? The riceball! A person will kill for rice. But rice won't kill for a person. So rice counts more than a person! That's crazy! I guess that makes sense. Then how about this? -You think cash can solve this? -I do. Rice may count more than a person, but money can buy rice and hire a person. So before money, rice and people are equal. So will you let money settle this? Don't use your shallow logic with me! If it's logical, what's the problem? That's enough, Omina. Samurai, please put this away. No, I insist! Allow me. -No… -No… No… You leave me no choice. If you really insist… Zenjuro! And you! Don't do that again. I may be in your debt, but I'm not paying you back! My teeth… That's brown rice, kneaded and kneaded and dried all day in the sun. It's a rock riceball! It's not something that anyone can just eat! You bastards! You tricked me! I told you it was my lunch! Does that taste good? Yeah. I see. There is a wildness here that goes beyond mere lust. If you don't like it, you can always leave. Tayu! Causing more trouble? No! I didn't-- You're hopeless! Well, that is very like you. But… she is part of Mukai, as are the men here. If you want to act superior and be flattered go to Kyoto or Osaka. The Kanto region and Mukai Village are not so shallow. I am told you call this place "Mukai" because it belongs to no realm. It is as you say. There are no boundaries of status such as "samurai" and "peasant." What counts here is appeal. The more appeal you have, the greater your pleasure. I see. What is your name? Tayu of Paradise. So that's you? Oh? You've heard of me? Your fame has spread all the way to Hakone. Heaven to meet, hell to befriend, Tayu of Paradise. What nonsense. Be with her once and you're in Heaven, but she will not fall for you so easily. Yet without her, it is as if you're suffering in hell. Heaven to meet, hell to befriend. It's very well-put. It's not my fault. It is the fault of Mukai. Samurai, in this town, it is not the men who choose. It's not the men? No. It is the women who choose. -The women? -Yes. You may desire a girl, but if she doesn't want you, she will never be yours no matter what. That's how it's done here. So a man must prove himself here. And so… you must prove yourself. Fine! Put me to the test! It's a game. Don't take it too seriously. I see. So what should I do? Either wait for a girl upstairs or try to ask them here. It's your choice. Ask them here? If no one raises her hand, we have a few men. Some customers prefer that. No. That's not my taste. Then wait upstairs. No. Though I am known as a man who can wait… Let us decide here. Then let's ask the girls. Your name, please. Mamiana. Mamiana Jiroemon. A "raccoon dog's den"? Well, ladies? Who would take Sir Mamiana as a customer? Me! -Me! -Who else? Me! Well? Yes! I like her! Just my type! I love… dry women like this. Your name? I'm Oyoshi. Oyoshi! Such a plain, boring name is perfect, too! I'll be staying a while. Yoshi, bring him food. I will. Right here. Mamiana Jiroemon, eh? I won't eat that up so easily. If you can't eat it, it must be serious. Yeah? -Help! -Woman! -Let me go! -Come over here! What's going on? Osato! Osato! Stop struggling! Quiet down! Tayu, I'm sorry! Stop, Hiragata! Shut up! I've waited so long, but no one came. So I picked one myself! Do you know Mukai's rules?! So what?! The woman chooses? A samurai deserves more respect! Osato is my woman! So why can't she please me? Is that true, Osato? -No, it isn't! -Stop! Sato's coming with me! Try to stop me and she dies! Hold it right there, Genemon! Don't try to stop me! I won't stop you. But in that case… why not take me? Tayu! If you must violate our rules, why not seize the best of the women in this village? Are you saying you'll come with me? Didn't you hear me? Wait! I… I'll go! Stay out of this, Tayu! Well then, Genemon? Then… Then undress! Take everything off! Till you're bare-ass naked! Oh, dear! You think I'm hiding something? I'm… I'm suspicious by nature. Or maybe you never meant to get naked with me! All right. If that will win your trust, it's easy enough to do. Just take it off! The likes of you… will never see… Tayu naked… in a hundred years! Here! Stop it. Stop it! That's enough! But… even I haven't seen it yet! Those eyes of yours… should just be crushed! You'll kill him! -Take this! -Everyone, help! Stop it, Hyogo! Leave, Genemon! We will do no more today, but the next time you return, I can't guarantee you'll live! Shut up! Remember this! You fool! Never return! That was way out of line! A jerk like that seeing you naked… Naked?! Naked? Naked! Naked! Nake… Nosebleed… If you wanted to see her naked so bad, you should've waited. I don't want to see! I would've stopped you. You could have waited till after she was naked. Yes. Rather, all the guys had their hopes up. -Right? -Yes, that's right. First of all, being naked wouldn't bother Tayu at all. Something like that is a cheap price to save a life. That's how she thinks. Yes! That's what she's like! I see… How would you know? I've met a lot of women in my time. You can tell by looking. Is it her eyes? Or her face? No. Her breasts! They have a lot of personality. Yes, truly. Well observed! You guys are awful! I'm sorry to have worried you, Tayu. That's all right. All of you here at this village are irreplaceable to me. And Tayu is a jewel I could never replace! Right, Tayu? Give me a smoke. And I, No-draw Hyogo, with all my manly spirit will stand guard for you. Right, Tayu? Sure. Thanks. She sure keeps him at arm's length. In the Inaba Province, there are very large sand dunes. If you shout there, like so… Tayu! Your voice is lost. There's no echo? None at all. I will stand on guard! How tragic! Truly tragic. Will you two quiet down! Ah, I am Mamiana Jiroemon. It is an honor. I'm the cheapskate, Sutenosuke. Don't you two be introducing yourselves! Don't get in the way of my romance! Sure. -Not you, Tayu! -She basically owns him now… So what brings you here, Hyogo? Oh, that's right! I completely forgot. Is Ranbei here? The owner is… He's out right now. That's too bad. The Skull Corps burned out some girls. Will you take them? Again?! What do you think this village is? A temple of refuge? B-But… we can't just leave them! They're in trouble! -Yeah, but… -It's fine, Zenjuro. Tayu! I'll speak to Ranbei. We were all once the same. We can't ignore them now. If you say so, Tayu. That's Tayu for you! And if you have any loving care left over… Oh? You're okay with… leftovers? Oh, no. Leftovers are no good… Well, there's no other choice. Go and find your own way. Okay. -He's hopeless. -He really is. Unfortunately so. Will you shut up?! What about the girls? They're out there with your men. Right, I'll go get them. I'll go. They're at the gate? I'll be right with you. So Mukai is a place of refuge. That's right. Just like I said. But it's a brothel. One where the girls choose their work. If they don't want to entertain, they can do something else. Omina here just arrived in the village, but she helps out in the kitchen. Right? Leave me out of it! This sure is an interesting place. Since I'm here… I suppose I'll have some fun. Hi, there! You're making me feel bad. Come on now! May your spirits become trees. May they grow mighty and tall. Be reborn as trees. Did someone die? Twenty-eight? That's a lot of deaths! What do you mean? For each one that passed, you plant a seed and pray. The dead become trees and guard the woods. It's a ritual, right? How do you know? People I used to know told me. Maybe that's what it looks like, but I'm just planting seeds. At this late hour? People told me they grow best when planted at night. Is that so? They taught me how to make these rock riceballs, too. But man, they're hard! They're good when you get used to them though. G-Good night. Whoa there! Sagiri! Sagiri, right? See? I knew it! You may have new clothes and a new name, but you're Sagiri of Kumaki! Sagiri of Kumaki? You're that idiot samurai! That's right! Hiragata Genemon, Esquire! You were there when they were building Skull Castle! -I remember you. -You were there?! That's right. Shogetsu! Here she is! It really is Sagiri! Well done, Genemon! The Skull Corps bastards! So you're Sutenosuke? But right now, we need the plans first. Capture Sagiri. Get her. "Plans"? -Cease and desist! -Ranbei! No one wreaks havoc in Mukai Village. I, Ranbei of Mukaiya, will not forgive you! Enough! You kill too many… Ranbei! You! It's been a while, Ranbei of Mukaiya. Oh! He moved! Who are they? The Skull Corps. Are you trying to start a war with the Skull Corps? Bind this man. Take the armor off the dead and bury the bodies out back. Are you okay, Omina? "Omina"? They called her "Sagiri" earlier. "Sagiri"? What's going on? It's all right. I know this man from a while back. You came saying your village had been burned. Why do the Skulls want you? You even changed your name, so there must be something big here. The Skulls from earlier were talking about some plans. Whoa, are you okay? You look pale. Get some rest. We'll talk tomorrow. -Sleep. -I agree. Come on, Omina. Sagiri is fine. All right. Come with me. A sobersides like you owns a brothel now? What a funny world. Some things just happen. I just got a bunch of women to work together. You'd fit the job better. I couldn't have done anything like this. I've abandoned all that binds me to this world. Thus I call myself Sutenosuke of Sanzu River. Sutenosuke? That sounds like you. But now that you've thrown all aside, what brings you here… to the Kanto region? There are some things that won't stay thrown away. Rumors I heard about Mukai and one more thing. The Skull Corps? Yes. I hear they boast about making the Kanto region the Sixth Realm. Did the lord send you?! Of course not! Don't be foolish. I know. The way he died, I wouldn't believe it. Even if I wanted to. Only he would have carved, "Rule over all" into his stomach then beheaded himself. I guess Lord Nobunaga really couldn't accept that Mitsuhide was a traitor. If only I'd been watching Mitsuhide more closely… You can say the same for me. But it's too late for that now. Then there's one more person left. The Man of Mankind? Yes. If we survived, I can only assume he did as well. But if all of this is his doing, then this is going to be messy. Tenmao, "the Demon King"… What a stupid name. And here, I thought I'd found refuge in the Kanto region. Why did he have to come here? Why not? If you could choose the Kanto region, so could he. The lord taught us all to think that way. You were away a few days. Where were you? I went to see Skull Castle. It's now finished and they're readying for war. The Monkey will send a huge army. The Skulls won't beat him. You think you stand a better chance? -That's right. -Don't, Ranbei. Don't worry. I'd never win. I've abandoned things, too. I hope so. Ranbei! -Ranbei! -What is it? Sagiri's gone! We found this. Let's go, Ranbei. She's in danger! Why? She's a Kumaki. Kumaki? The builders? Skull Castle was finished in just six months. Only they could have done that. So the plans are for Skull Castle? I get it now. I didn't think she's leave now. Okay. I'll tell Hyogo, too. Ranbei, come on! Hm? Tenmao? We're honored that the head Skull came so fast. Tenmao greatly wished to meet you gentlemen. Ranbei and Sutenosuke… I'm honored you already know my name. There is nothing in the Kanto region that Tenmao doesn't know about. Even you, Sutenosuke. He took note of you the moment you arrived in the Kanto region. What greater honor could there be? In that case… it would please me much to see the face beneath that mask. Are you sure? Once you do… there is no going back. Fine! I never dreamed we three would ever meet again. I am pleased! So it was you. Just drop it. Our dream shattered when the lord died. For a "person" to become the "heavens," you'd need two lines! Then you two shall be the lines! -What?! -Ranbei! Don't take him seriously. He's spewing nonsense. Even if you add two lines to "person," you'll just end up a mere "husband!" Those kinds of jokes won't get us anywhere! What? You're Sutenosuke, yet you've thrown away nothing. You've just closed your eyes to your own cowardliness. Listen to him! Open your eyes and see our dream coming back to life! That dream! How much blood will it cost? Indeed! How much? The deeper the lake of blood, the more vivid the dream. Is that right? Well, I've only just begun. If so, the path you walk on brings too many tears. I decline your offer. I see. Then die. I decline! What?! Damn you! Sutenosuke! Impossible… Tenmao is the spirit of the Demon King! Weapons of mortals cannot harm him. This is as far as you go! What kind of armor is that? Is that Spanish? Knowing won't help you. What you have thrown away is your life, Sutenosuke! Hold it! -What? -So you're the rumored Tenmao? Here I come, Mamiana Jiroemon, a wandering samurai of the three realms. Don't! You'll get hurt. No. I come to like this village. Wait! Wait, you all! Tenmao! Not yet. -What do you fear, Shogen? -Not here! This is not the time. You fools who dare spit in the wind, take time and think. Join me in my purpose or die when we next meet. -Wait! -Enough! We can't take him now. Sutenosuke! Well, it looks like you saved our lives. I did wish to speak more of breasts with you. Is that so? You! How did you… I am Mamiana Jiroemon, a wandering samurai. Having heard tell of Mukai, I find it to my liking. I will allow no one to bring it harm. But… Damn. That's Sagiri! Let's go, Ranbei! Hey, wait! Wait for me! Let go! Let go of me! Give that back! Give it back! Give it back! Quiet! So these are the plans to Skull Castle… Am I right? Huh? Huh? This is great! Man, this armor's hot! I've seen you before… Sagiri! -Sango, you bastard! -Sango! Oh! The guy who's in and out of the Skulls! Don't move! If I have these plans, we have no quarrel. I hate fighting. Are you a Skull to the bone now?! What?! A Skull? I left that place. -What? -See this armor? It's so heavy! Crazy heavy! They're all idiots strutting around calling themselves "the Iron Guard." My smarts don't fit in. They say "I'm a blood brother." But I'm treated like an errand boy. Then why take the plans? When we went into Mukai, I just hid and watched. Since I'm smarter than those fools. I can take this to Toyotomi and have him make me one of his retainers! The Skulls… compared to Toyotomi's army, are like mere pill-bugs! Toyotomi's going to crush you! Man, you're awful. Don't underestimate me. I change quicker than lightning. With these plans, I don't need you any more. Live well. Bye. I captured Sagiri. Ikoma! Kicho! Who are you? Odagiri Sango of the Iron Guard. Your humble servant Odagiri Sango has also found the castle plans you seek. Hey… She was on her way to Hideyoshi with the castle plans, but your servant Odagiri Sango stopped her and retrieved the castle plans. It's real. Well done, Iron Guard. I am Odagiri Sango! For the Skull Corps, I will brave fire and flood. Odagiri Sango will give his very life! You lowlife! Bring her to Skull Castle, Iron Guard. Odagiri Sango! Leave this to me, Odagiri Sango! Bye, Hyogo. Tayu! Give back those plans! -Or else! -Or else what? Double-barrels… Next time we aim to kill. Oh no you don't! What? You were tied up in the persimmon drying shed! You thought you could bind Shogetsu so easily? You pull those triggers and I cut her throat. Who'll be faster? Kill Sagiri and you pay with your lives. If you anger Tenmao, you won't get away so easily. We have nothing to lose. Neither one of us can make a move. Don't try anything funny, you hick samurai. Because if you do, the girl dies. -You fool! -Sagiri! Take the plans. But I'm not going to Skull Castle. -What?! -I'd rather die than go back there! And you'll all be shot to death. Do you want that? Ikoma! Where there's life, there's hope. Tenmao will be happy with just the plans. -Shogetsu! -Damn it! Wait, you bastards! Cease fire! It's a waste. What happened?! Sutenosuke! It's alright. We have Sagiri. Tayu, where did you get guns? We're survivors of Saika. This is nothing. Saika, where the fusiliers came from? How did they get here? These are the women of Saika Fusiliers who fought and fell to Hideyoshi. They were driven from the West and settled here. Fusiliers?! You're just full of surprises! Right? At least you're safe. Relax. But the plans… Damn that Sango! Sango? That traitor? Yeah. He stole them. Were they really the plans to Skull Castle? Yes. I see. They're getting ready for war with Osaka right now. It's bad if the enemy has the plans to your castle. The Skulls must be desperate. Osaka? It seems that the Regent Toyotomi Hideyoshi is coming to the Kanto region with 200,000 men. -200,000? -200,000… The incompetent rely on their numbers. So it's time for him to crush the Kanto region, then… He's come to crush Tenmao! Whoever takes his head gets 500 in gold! 500?! Yes. There's a reward. So we're caught between the Hideyoshi and Tenmao… That's serious! Sagiri… you're from the Kumaki clan? The Kumaki clan? The builders? Builders? They're said to be the best castle-builders known to man. I hear the chief, Sekishinsai, is a genius. But why did you take the plans? We were scared of Tenmao. We built his castle to withstand Hideyoshi's army but we didn't understand just how horrible Tenmao was. Twenty-eight people… He killed your whole clan? Dead men tell no tales. That's just like him. That makes me mad! They told me to flee to Tokugawa Ieyasu in Mikawa Province. Ieyasu's easy to butter up, so if I talk smooth, it'll go well… is what my Grandpa said. But in the end… we were fools. Was Sekishinsai killed, too? -Probably. -But it's fine since Tenmao has the plans. He's not that nice, huh? I doubt it. So there'll be another war? Ranbei… We'll fight. There's nowhere else to go. When our village was burned down and we came here, we worked hard to built this place. This is our last hope. Even if we leave, it'll be the same everywhere else. How do we fight 20,000 Skulls? That's easy! We just kick butt, 20,000 times, one at a time! Hyogo… What are you afraid of?! 20,000 Skulls. Hideyoshi's army has 200,000! Together, that's 250,000 butts! -Boss! -That's wrong. Anyway, we just kick a lot of butts! That's all! That's all! That's crazy. We are crazy! We're the Rowdies of the East. Words like that… go in one eye and out the other! It's "ear"! Listen up and remember this! We guard Mukai! We are the sons of warriors, the Rowdies of the East! Don't try to stop us! For the women we love, we will fight the greatest foe! You're so cool! For real men, it's the only decent thing to do! Right, Tayu? Quit your bragging… Hyoroku! Brother… "Brother"? Oh, bother! At last I've found you! -"Warrior's son"? -No… Our family's dirt farmers! Peasants! Come back home! Ma and Pa are waiting! Who would you be? Don't pretend you don't know me! It's your older brother, Isohei! Hey! Did you forget this face?! All the village folk say they forgive you. But the Kanto region is way too wild. I broke my teeth just eating a riceball! I broke my teeth! Can you believe that?! There must be some mistake, old man. My name is Hyogo. -It's not "roku." -Who's that? Your name is Hyoroku! My eyes don't deceive me. Come home. How dare you… Oh, dear! What happened? This old man doesn't seem well. My… Guys, take him inside. Quickly! Hold this! Okay… Ready… -One, two! -One, two! One, two! Like I said… Tayu, I'll handle this. Watch me, ya hear? "Ya hear"? Ya hear… Ya hear… Ya hear… You here won't be disappointed! I'll make you happy. What a fool! Yes. A wise man knows when to fear. But he may be the most warlike warrior of us all. What? No way! Someone like him? Things are going to get a bit sticky, Ranbei. Here. Coming! Excuse me. Sorry, everyone. Wait for me! I'm coming, Jiro! What's that sly geezer-- If he was going to betray us, he would have already. Don't worry. As long as you stay Ranbei of Mukaiya, he'll stay Mamiana Jiroemon. Alright, whoa… Now go. But… It might be just as Hyogo said. We can't let them wreck a nice village like this. -A nice village? -Sure. The women are gorgeous… and the men are all stupid. Where will you find a better place than that? You've done a great job. You think so? Yeah. A nice village… It's too bad that I was the last one to realize. Ranbei? Listen, Ranbei. I'll be back in three days. Whatever you're brooding about, keep a lid on it. What's your plan? To bring down Tenmao first, before Hideyoshi. That's how we can save this village. Sutenosuke! You stay here. Don't do anything stupid. Tayu, take care of Sagiri. I will. This village… is a safe haven for women. Spoken like a woman! I could fall for you. Well, won't you give it a try? I'm not so crass as to try for a woman with a man in her heart. What? Hear me, Ranbei! Don't try to beat me to the punch. He's a strange one. Ranbei? What? You have a very scary look in your eye. No, I don't. We've moved on and moved on… and we finally built this place. With just us… and you, Ranbei. We can't go back to the past now. That's right! We'll be fine. I won't do anything to worry you. Of course not. Right? Right. Let's go, Sagiri. Okay. But… I will defend those women. That is the one and only task I have left. FORTY-FOUR MAGNUM Beautiful! This katana is truly beautiful. But I am still more beautiful. Time to start over. Hi! You again? What is it now, "Sutenosuke"? Quit changing names. It's too hard to remember. Wait! Oh, no! Jeez… Sorry. I was supposed to have thrown away my entire past… But you couldn't, so that's why you're here? You're right. Where's your husband? Dead. Six months ago, heart attack, pounding on a katana. Here. That sounds just like him. But that presents a problem. Why? I really needed something. Oh, that… You mean the letter that this pigeon brought over? That's right. The Spanish armor. The impenetrable armor that blocks katanas and even bullets? Yeah. I wanted a katana that could cut through it. Spanish, huh? I saw some once, at Azuchi Castle. A man named Frois had it. There's a man who wears it… trying to revive Lord Nobunaga's dream. That's Tenmao. Tenmao? You know him as… the Man of Mankind. That name sure takes me back. You're going to fight him? Yeah. He's the better swordsman. I know that! However… It's my job to stop him. I see. Maybe you're right. That's why I wanted a katana that could cut through that armor. Now what? I'll have it tomorrow. Tomorrow. How? Your letter said you needed a katana. I can read. But Gantetsusai… I inherited all of my husband's skills. I'm Gantetsusai now. I was always better at little tricks like these, anyway. You were? Again… So you made this one, too? That's right. How magnificent! You really might be the better smith. No, not yet. No? This looks pretty good. No. I'm still more beautiful. I'm more beautiful. I…! I actually… No! Honey, I'm sorry! I was just so lonely! No, I am lonely! I'm lonely! Help me! Lend me this. Sure, you can take them, but you're leaving me? You are? Of course. That's the right choice. I was a fool! So… How many will your katana kill? Just one, of course. Just one set of armor. Draw it before that, and it won't even draw blood. It won't be of any use afterwards, either. Then can you make a katana that will kill a hundred? No way. You can slash five, or stab ten. No matter how good the katana, blood and bodily fluids dull the blade. -But there is one way… -How? Slash, then sharpen! Stab, then hammer! Wait! W-Wait! You're too fast! Just wait! I'm coming, too. It's not safe. I have to see how the impenetrable armor stands up to the armor-piercing blade. Armor-piercing? Write "armor," "cut," and "blade." Armor-piercing blade. Just one more night, so stick around. No. I have a bad feeling… I need to get back. This is where I'll be. I'll be waiting. O-Oh, I'll hurry. And where are you going… Ranbei of Mukaiya? Ahead lies Skull Castle. We are charged with its guard. Go further… and we must match swords. Stand aside if you do not wish to die. This won't be like last time. If that's the way you want it. Fine! Tenmao will be pleased to have your head. Fools! Kill him. Cease! This is a flute of the dead. It separates this world and the next. Don't make it play. Too late to live for ambition… Too jaded to live for love… Too sad to live for dreams… Thus I keep a brothel. What a drag, huh? Cheeky bastard! Take me to Tenmao. What do you want? Don't worry. I'm here for business. What?! What are you doing?! Haste will be the end of you. Yuken, Shogetsu, put down your katanas. Excuse our poor manners… Ranbei of Mukaiya. You are? Shogen of Tenbu. We met the other day. Tenmao awaits you. Come. This way. Well… Ranbei of Mukaiya's last big deal. I don't come cheap… Tenmao. A beautiful full moon. Does seeing it in such magnificent array… make one wish to not soil it… with your blood? Who sent you?! The Monkey, or the Racoon Dog? Beasts in human form, thieves threatened by my rule. Have at me. And at least fall like petals… as you die. A man's life is 50 years It is but a dream Beside all under Heaven. Is one ever born who will never die? Could there be one… Who never dies? This does not calm my blood. Tenmao, Ranbei of Mukaiya awaits you in the Throne Room. He would know when the time has come for petals to fall. Well… I was expecting you, Ranma-- It's Ranbei. Ranbei of Mukaiya. Still you insist? You're as stubborn as ever. Whatever. Ladies… Hideyoshi's 200,000 men will soon arrive at Sunpu. And it is time to conquer the Kanto region! Already? Here's Skull Castle, here's Odawara Castle. The Monkey will camp here… at Mount Ishigaki. Against him we have 20,000 Skulls! In terms of numbers, we are greatly outnumbered. You believe our defenses are weak here. How do you know? Did you think I wouldn't realize that you've been watching us? But that weakness is a strategy designed to lure Hideyoshi here. Lure? Hideyoshi is only focused on the Kanto region. Osaka is bare. And so, I will seize this chance and strike Osaka. And where is that army? -At sea. -At sea? England has sunk a Spanish armada, and sails for Zipang, the land of gold. England?! It's taken eight years to arrange this. I shall give them Kyushu. Hideyoshi has kept his lords in line with just money. If his main castle in Osaka falls, will Mori and Uesugi stay quiet? Or Ieyasu, that cunning racoon dog? This land shall return to its warring days. Doesn't this excite you, Ranmaru?! Enough! Enough. I'm not here to talk about that today. Then what? I'm here to talk business! A brothel is a business. Why else would I risk my life coming here if not for business? Fine! What kind of business? 300 guns. From the Saika women? So you know? That speeds things up. And what do you want from me in exchange for 300 guns? The lives of the men and women of Mukai Village. Begging for the lives of your friends… It's because of them that I'm still alive. Now it's my turn. You'd have guns with which to use against Toyotomi. How boring. That's a shame. Yes… This is more like you. Now there's fire in your eyes! You look more alive with a katana in your hand. What's wrong, Ranbei?! I stand before you without my impenetrable armor. You risked your life coming here to find me like this. Cut my throat or run me through the heart, and I will surely die. Now, do it. What? Why don't you cut me down? I could ask you the same. Why don't you kill me?! I want to savor this moment. I can't get enough of it! This barter of life or death. You're enjoy this? Yes, I am! This is how it was when the lord was alive. In his castle, or out in battle… We always stood at the boundary of death. In that intense atmosphere which felt like it could even cut flesh, he was always testing us. And that… is how it feels to be alive! -Am I wrong? -That's… I will return this land to how it was back then. I will let no one stop me! What now? Shall we commit a double-suicide? Will you kill me here or kill me then yourself? Is that why the lord spared your life? Have you survived all this time just for that? I'm sure you feel my rage at Hideyoshi who believes himself to be the divine ruler! Everything he does… is merely a caricature… of what Lord Nobunaga did! A monkey… does naught but ape. As do you, in the lord's name! You're wrong! I am me, and not me. I am the spirit… of the Demon King, returned from the Sixth Heaven. Look at this mask! Is the face not familiar? Impossible! That is… Yes! This is the skull of Lord Nobunaga! And now I wear it as a mask! Tenmao is me, and also not me. The lord's rage at being struck down, his dream unfulfilled. You share that rage. What? Don't mock me. I know that necklace of yours is carved from the lord's bones. -That's… -You wear it around your neck. Do you keep it as a memento? This is rage and grief… no less bitter than mine! Am I wrong? Drink this, and pledge by this cup! It is made from the lord's bones. And its liquor… from his blood! He will live forever in us. Together, we will make his dream come true! Three hundred guns? I have no need for that! What I want is one man. You… Mori Ranmaru! Well done. Damn. So the Kumaki girl found her way in… I'm impressed! I'll reward your bravery with a show. Grandpa? Dad? You're alive? For now. But now that I have the castle' plans… Sagiri! …I have no need for them. Grandpa! Dad! Kumaki Sekishinsai had marvelous talent. Too bad it shortened his life. You fiend! Sagiri, was it? It appears you are now the last Kumaki. You'll pay for this! You'll pay for this, Tenma-- Oh, what will you do? A helpless girl like you comes at me with a blade? Did you think you'd kill the Demon King? I see. Was this your dream? I'm afraid this dream won't come true… ever. So tell me! Will there be anything else? Any other wishes or dreams? Won't you tell me?! For defying he who will rule all, those dreams shall be crushed! Know now how helpless you are. Ranbei! Help me, Ranbei! Ranbei of Mukaiya is dead. Now I am only… a wraith. Mori Ranmaru! The ghost of one who should have moldered away! Mori Ranmaru? Well said, Ranmaru! Now kill that woman. And let us feast! Her blood will suit the banquet that welcomes you back to life. What are you doing?! Please! Snap out of it! -Ranbei! -That man is gone! Why?! Sutenosuke to you to wait till he came back! Sutenosuke?! Have you given him a task? How futile! He can do nothing! He's one of us. Me, Ranmaru, and Sutenosuke. The three of us… Our fates are one. -Lies! -It's true! Listen up. He is the one who first told me of the Kumaki clan. He is the one who gave me the opportunity to kill off your clan. -No way… -Resign yourself, Sagiri! Grandpa… Dad! All right! Now I understand. You samurai think of nothing but yourselves! You think the world revolves around you. You may think you have me cornered now… but remember one thing… I know this castle like the back of my hand! How clever of her. Yuken! Shogetsu! The Kumaki girl has fled. Kill her. Take Ranmaru. Understood. Tenmao! What is it?! Messages from England. At last! What?! What is it? We must redraw our map. Hey! What are you doing? You're too slow! Hold it, you little brat! There! After her! Don't let her get away! You dare mock us, you wretch… There! Search that way! Hurry! Told ya! The Kumaki clan built this castle! Catch me if you can! Hey, stupid! I'm over here! She's all over the place! Don't let her go! Damn it! Where are you?! There? That way! After her! Wait! Wait! Look… it's blood. Good. Wipe it up and give the scent to the dogs. It's probably hers. Move it! Get to the kennels! Go! Hurry! Where the hell am I?! That way! Hurry! Well? Damn it. Hey. Who said you could rest? Get looking, you fool! -I'll kill you! -Idiot! What's all the fuss, Yuken? Has pretty-boy lost face? Keep out of this. You became impatient and attacked Ranbei, but it angered Tenmao and now you need to get back into his good graces? Enough! The plans to the castle! You have those and you still can't catch her? The Skulls are looking bad! Silence! She's cunning! She pops up anywhere. Can you read that? Let me have a look. No, thanks. We don't have the time. Shogetsu, you go that way. Right! Work hard! As if I'd let them kill me here! Look! Gotcha! Those two oafs couldn't catch you, but I, Myosei the Karura, can! Let go! The order is to kill you, so I'll just do that now. What strong eyes! "I won't die here," they say. Killing such a woman… is what I love best! Is that how you killed my people?! Your people? The Kumaki clan? Yep. I killed them. They were tough. I had fun killing them. Now, if you don't mind, let me have some fun with you! It's all gone dark. It made me scream in surprise. But I don't scream like that. A light! Somebody bring a light! Are you all right, Sagiri? You! I came back, but you and Ranbei were gone… so I came here. I'm glad you're safe. -Stop! -What's wrong? You want to fool me, too! But it's not going to work! -Me? -Ranbei betrayed us! He joined Tenmao. And he says you're with them! -Ranbei? -Not Ranbei! Mori Ranmaru. That fool! Tenmao said… you told him all about the Kumaki clan! And it's true, you knew about us. You knew all about the Kumaki! Calm down, Sagiri! They killed Grandpa and Dad… right in front of me! What? They were alive. Right in front of me! Oh, no… It's cruel… It's too cruel! And it's all… It's all your fault! Yes. You're right. Rot in hell! Are you satisfied now? You let me do that… Why?! I had to, so you'd cool your head. I don't know… what to believe any more! Just believe this. I came here to help you. Yes, your clan's downfall was my fault. But that's why I want to save you. Why?! It was eight years ago. One man was killed… He was just short of his dream of uniting the land. But he was killed by one of your vassals. This man's name was… Oda Nobunaga. Ranbei and I served him. So did Tenmao. Served Nobunaga? We devoted both body and soul to Lord Nobunaga. Ranbei and Tenmao were his pages. I was one of his agents in the shadows. That's where I met the Kumakis. I told Tenmao about these great builders. At that time, I reported to the lord through him. Your clan did great work on the lord's castle at Azuchi. However… if I hadn't spoken of them, they'd never have built this castle. That's what happened? Lord Nobunaga's dream was our dream as well. We supported him with my ninja skills and Tenmao's insight. We aimed to join heaven and earth under his rule. But… Heaven had other plans. When the lord died, Tenmao decided he could be ruler of all, too. He no longer knew his place. Sutenosuke! I stabbed you in the stomach! What I've done is unforgivable! Don't worry! The Kumaki's rock riceballs… sure are hard! You deceived me! Keep your voice down! Worry me again… and I'll beat you black and blue! That's the Sagiri I know. Come on. From here, we can escape. That's as far as you go! We've got you now. The fools show up just in time! -Go on! -But… Mukai's in danger! Warn Hyogo that Ranbei's changed sides. -I'll finish things here and follow you. -But… Enough buts! -Just trust me. -Okay! Oh no, you don't! Hey, the traitor! You came at a good time. This is the perfect place for a betrayal! What? Take Sagiri and leave this castle if you value your life! -Sutenosuke! -What do you mean? Sango, you said your life was the most important thing. Then watch… and ask yourself… who will fall and who will live. Are you really going to bet on these guys? What did you say?! You there! Hold onto her! See? They don't even know your name. What?! No way! If you want to still be alive at the end… you should already know who you need to betray! Right, Odagiri Sango? Let her go and you die! I won't let you! I won't let you touch them. Either way, I'll likely die… Maybe. -Come, Sagiri! -But… -What the hell? -Come! -No! Stop! -Yes! Go, Sagiri. He's good at staying alive. Stick with him and you will not die. -Come! -Sutenosuke! Bye! Damn… Ranbei! It's useless to struggle, Sutenosuke. Damn you, Ranbei! Not Ranbei! What you see here is a ghost in thrall to the Demon King. One who should have died in the flames of Honnoji Temple. This smell…you've drugged him. With some kind of potion. A foreign dream liquor, made with poppy-seed. One sip and you're in paradise. Ranbei! Don't you understand?! This man will never rule all! Absurd! Drop it! Your katana cannot touch Tenmao! Not only yours. Neither can Hideyoshi's. You really are fools. Do you think you'll defeat Hideyoshi?! Of course. Yes, Hideyoshi is powerful. But the foreigners are stronger. If they're with us, we have nothing to fear. Madness! Bring them in, and this land will never be at peace! Who needs peace? This land must burn in Hell before it can know peace. So Tenmao believes. Who do you think you are?! Fool! If you hadn't let that woman stab you… you wouldn't be reduced to this! Ranbei! Why? Why did you come to this castle? A fine village exists because of you! Why?! That is only an unlucky twist of fate. You stupid fool! Ranbei! Open your eyes! They are open! As the lord led us in everything… I let him precede me into death. That will not happen now! This time, I shall remain with he who rules all. Sutenosuke… You will never understand. Finish him! Not you, Shogetsu! He is not a man for the likes of you! Ranbei, you bastard! Not Ranbei. It's Ranmaru. Starting tonight, Ranmaru now commands my army. To disobey him is to disobey me. Understood. Take this man to a cell. -You'll let him live? -I can still use him. Ranmaru! There is still one thing you must do. One thing I must do? To be a true demon, you must cut all your ties… by the shedding of blood. Yes. You're right. Aw, man! Ranbei and Sagiri have disappeared… And Sutenosuke should have come back by now. What's going on? -Not this way! -Will you shut up? -Stop complaining and run! -What's your problem?! Stop pulling me! Come on! Hyogo? Is that you, Hyogo?! Great! We're in Mukai Village! We're saved! Sango, you bastard! Damn you! Are you back to attack us again?! Wait! Listen! No! Stop, Hyogo! Why? Believe it or not, I owe him my life! What?! Sort of. It's true, you are good at staying alive. Damn right! Don't you know who I am? I betrayed my parents from birth and continued to do so for 30 years! Changing sides quick as a flash! I am Odagiri Sango! Quit posing! -Who's that?! -The Skulls? Forgive me! Just kidding! I'm looking for Mukai Village… I have business with Sutenosuke. -Sutenosuke? -Who are you? I brought him something he wanted. I'm Gantetsusai. Gantetsusai? You? -You know her? -Yeah. Sutenosuke said you're a swordsmith. What? Oh, no… Tayu! This smell… It smells like blood to me. Mukai's this way. Come on! -Who's there?! -It's Oyuri. Onozo. All clear. The back gate's fine, too. Who's that?! Good evening. All's well here. Zenjuro! Doing your rounds? Once two hours. -All's well. -Well done. Help us with these. Tayu… -Sorry, but have those ready. -Of course. We don't know what'll happen. These are straight from the Kunitomo foundry! Leave everything to Oyoshi! Oyoshi! How beautiful… this gun has become. Okay, I'll do the rest. Kunitomo guns truly are the best! And no one maintains them better than you. Polishing guns is all this dry old lady can do. -Yep. -No, you're beautiful as well! Nope. Will you shut up! No, I mean it! Lately, everyone's been talking about how beautiful you've become! Really? Having a good man… changes a woman. Jiroemon, was it? When he first picked you, I thought he was nuts. I guess some people have unique taste. I guess so. But he's so generous and broad-minded! He doesn't dress very well… and sometimes you wonder what he's thinking. But he's a man to be reckoned with. He might even rule the land one day. Don't be silly! He's turned your head right around! I'm all in a sweat! Whoa! Well? I went as far as the three pines, but I didn't see Ranbei or Sagiri. No? I wonder where they went. It's worrying. Here we are! Everybody… you've worked hard! So here's… dinner! Thank you! This was made with love! We've got tea, too! The tea leaves read "lucky"! And the pickled radishes have been cut into a lucky shape! You can't fight when you're hungry! Thank you! Big Boss. Big Boss? You're our Boss Hyogo's older brother, so you're our Big Boss. Cut it out! That fool's got a swollen head from you talking him up! He acts cool and calm, but then he goes crazy! He had to leave our village after he killed a samurai… who raped a girl there! He's nothing but a peasant… just like me! So what? A peasant, a samurai… Who cares?! "Help the weak, smash the strong. We're the Rowdies of the East." That's his motto! He may go about it wrong, but what he does makes sense. That's why he's the boss and why we follow him! So don't take him back! We need him with us! Please! Um… You don't need to worry. That riceball's soft. Your teeth won't break. I'm not worried about that! But it made you angry-- I'm not angry! I'm sorry. -Gonbe… -It's Isohei! Do you really want to take your brother home? Damn right! Myself and Isakichi there… used to be samurai. Hyogo… Sorry. Hyoroku… was someone we were sent out to kill. The samurai he killed… was the idiot son of an elder on the domain we served. What he did was outrageous. But orders are orders. We were ordered to avenge the son… so we followed Hyogo. But… after watching him, we started to wonder who was right. No… We saw that he was the one who acted like a true samurai. We didn't know what to do. What did that make us, then? We're still wondering. Going home didn't make any sense. And now, they're letting us work here in the village. We want to watch and see… how long he stays on the straight and narrow. Otherwise, we'll just continue to wonder. Please. Please! He took it! He ate it! It's good. Hooray! Hooray! Boss is late. I'll tell him there's food. Hey, what's wrong? Koheiji? But why?! Ranbei? What are you doing?! No way… Tenmao?! I see! The women of Mukai are indeed very beautiful! But we do not need that here in the Kanto region. Not in the hell… that I will create. Oyuri! Are you still lost?! Then I'll show you the way. Your path leads to hell. Guard Isohei and the women! Stop, Ranbei! Have you gone mad?! I do not expect forgiveness, but with your blood, I will wash away the impurities within me. Your blood will not be wasted. What are you saying, Ranbei?! Get out of here! You won't touch Tayu! The Saika women are resolved! See if we aren't! Is this suicide by grenade? Ranbei! I'll die before I forgive a traitor! Now your grenades are as useless as you are. Oyoshi! Well, Ranmaru? Osato! Having fun? Oyoshi! -This indeed is fun. -Good! This is our true nature! Use the power you have! The weak and defenseless… Strike them down! There is none stronger than he who flees into his own weakness! Forget gratitude! Incur hatred! Think only of yourself! By smashing all down into fearful submission, we who rule over all… will create a new order! Yes! This was the way of the lord! Not the lord. From now on… Us. Hurry and run! Why are you saving a stranger? Not a stranger! You're our Big Boss! We're samurai! We protect women and the weak! If we turn tail here, Hyogo will chew us out! Now go! All of you… What worthless courage. Run! It's not worthless. It's not worthless! Boss's fists are harder than that katana! A man who falls from wounds like these… is not a man! Fall we may, but we will stand again! That is… the spirit of the Rowdies! Ha! You call yourselves warriors? I laugh. Guys! Tayu! Stay alive! You two… Why?! Why did you do this… Ranbei of Mukaiya?! I've rid myself of that name! This is who I really am. Damn you! With your blood, I wash away my last tie. So the new guns don't work either… There you are, Lord of Mikawa… To shoot before announcing yourself does not suit your reputation for patience. Or has dressing up as a vagabond turned you into one? Lord Tokugawa Ieyasu. Ieyasu?! I had my doubts, so I sent an agent to Sunpu. And sure enough, Lord Ieyasu was not there. You are brave to have come alone into the Kanto region as a spy. I am told… Hideyoshi plans to make you Lord of the Kanto region. Thus you are here to investigate. Jiroemon! So the Demon King really is you… Now you know. The lord is dead, but not his dream. The ruler of all… will not be Hideyoshi nor you. It will be the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven! Don't make me laugh! Excellent! I hoped it would come to this. Yours? Same difference. We've been looking for you! Now, fall back! Stand clear, Hanzo! No! To fight here means war. That would be rash without Hideyoshi's approval. I am here to protect you, Sire. You can fight. Who are you?! Me? A ninja states his name only upon his death. Hattori Hanzo of Iga. -Sire! -You fool! You've got to smack him one! Go! It must be hard being a great lord. Just continue keeping Hideyoshi happy. I doubt you're happy we know who you are. Instead of your head, we'll take hers. Paradise! -Tayu! -Sagiri! You okay, Paradise? Leave now, or else! Or what? No! That won't cut his armor. It's a special blade made to cut that armor. Armor-piercing blade. So you're Gantetsusai now? Yes, if you're Tenmao. I see… Karma is at work… in mysterious ways. Very well! Fire! A fire! Sagiri of Kumaki! I'll reward your bravery with some news. Sutenosuke is alive! In my dungeon, breathing his last. But who will die first, him or you? You're the one who'll croak first! Keep barking! This world will be chaos. If you would rule, remake it. From the start, with your own hands. A man's life is 50 years It is but a dream Taste to the full the nightmare this Demon King will unleash… Lord Ieyasu. You bastards! Hakusuke! Aokichi! What happened? What happened?! Hey, Akazo? Akazo! Are you all right, Tayu? Well, I am… The fire's all around us! It's not safe. Let's go! Hey! Wake up, you guys! The gunpowder! Come on, Hyogo! Aokichi! Get up! Get up! Get up, will you! Hyogo! Get up! No! No! What are you doing?! What good would that do?! You defend the weak, right? Then defend Isohei and me! They all died well. Your men were good men. Boss Hyogo! Yeah? Yeah! You're all the same! Tenmao… -You'll pay for this! -Sire! Please wait! Let go! Even patience has its limits! Sire! You must be at your castle when the Regent arrives! I know! There are rumors that you and Tenmao are plotting to kill the Regent! What? If you don't meet Lord Hideyoshi now, he will suspect you! Leave this place, Sire! He did this… Damn you, Tenmao! What a shabby trick. What about these people? Leave them. -Hanzo! -Yes! After we meet the Regent… we'll set out. For? The invasion of Skull Castle! Onozo… Ohiro… Oyuri… Omaki… Osato… Oyoshi… May you all… rest in peace. -The guns? -It's no good. They're all gone. It must be Ranbei. I need a favor. I know it's crazy, but you're the only one… Sutenosuke… Right? You don't need to ask. I was on my way. Toyotomi's coming. You'll die if you go to Skull Castle! I know that already! You only die once. A man can at least choose where to die. I thought killing one was one too many. Old sword-lady, sharpen this for me. Who's old?! That's "Elder Sister" to you! Let's see that. Look at this! It's all rusty! Ugly! Not beautiful! No-draw Hyogo? You're just lazy! Please! Do it yourself. It's your katana! Put that under it! Kneel. Two hands. Tell it you're very, very sorry. -I'm sorry. -"Very"! Tayu? This was just in case. Ranbei took the guns… But there was one I didn't tell anyone about. I didn't think we'd be betrayed, but it was always a possibility. It saddens me… but that's how I survive. Wow! Rolling Thunder. A foreign invention improved on in Saika. -Hyogo… -Huh? I'm coming, too! The survivors have to finish what they've started. If not… these girls will laugh. You wouldn't listen even if I said no. All right. We live or die together, Tayu. Follow me! But they have the plans, right? Those plans are just a part of it. The secrets of Skull Castle… are right here! I'm Sekishinsai! I'm the Kumaki builder. Grandpa was a decoy. They all died to protect me. I don't want anyone else to be a victim for my sake! Then I'll give you this. I made it for Sutenosuke to beat Tenmao. Here. If you want to save him… give him that yourself. Make sure you do. Thank you. If there's a fight… you'll need people. -Sango! -But don't rely on me too much. I don't know what I'm saying. That's the only way to stay alive. That's what your blood's saying. Maybe. Tenmao! You may underestimate us, but we'll show you… exactly what we can do! -Let's go! -Yeah! Hey, are those the cells? Sutenosuke's probably there! They seem mad. There's no way out of this hall except the garden. We'll distract them. Go with Sango. You two know this place best. Sango! I sharpened this. A beautiful katana reflects its owner. Live or die, it's up to you now. Okay! Here we go! Now! Oh no, you don't! Myosei! The traitor dares to return? Are you stupid? Only stupid kids… call someone stupid! Are we doing this?! Stupid! Stupid! Anyway… I'll quickly shut your mouth for you! Can you? What?! I've never actually fought, so I don't know how strong I am. Going easy, and little tricks like that… I don't know. Give me everything you've… got. Quit your damn bragging! Oh, no! I'm super weak! The end! I'm sorry… not! I change quick as a flash! A cheap trick! It's not cheap. It saved my life. I'm hurt! Sango… you're kind of amazing. You thought he'd cut me down, didn't you? Well… yeah. So I betrayed that thought! -Sorry, alright?! -Come on. Well! So the hick samurai thinks he can come in here? One who comes to Skull Castle without testing his arm… is a fool. You won't take me so easily! No-draw Hyogo, was it? You think you can take us without a katana? You leave me no choice. A man's got to do… what a man's got to do! What's that? Shut up. I just sharpened it a little too much. All that? Well, hick? You talk big… but that's all. Brother! The best sickle… in the village! Hyoroku! These are mine! Shut up and use them! A peasant's sickle… is his soul! I'm with you, Brother! Let's go, Rowdies! Whirlwind Rice Sickles! These two idiots… …beat us?! Bear this in mind! We cut off weeds at the root! We are… the peasants of justice! We did it! -Hyoroku! -We did it! Good work. I knew we could do it. Wipe your katana, first! You sheathe it with blood on it! That's why it rusts, I told you! Sorry! -Look! -What? This edge! It's beautiful! Forget that! Come on! Let me see that, please! They didn't last long. Oh, dear! I missed! This gun's not set up very well. -That's… -Yes. One of your Saika guns. Thank you for them. Then the problem is your aim. A Saika gun is as good as the one using it. Don't make a fool of yourself. Like you are with your make-up. You're only a bit younger… and your tits are a bit bigger. Being stuck-up about that will shorten your life. Is that right? That's got two barrels, and you're out of bullets. You can't shoot any more. Well! Aren't we clever! There's another gun, I'm afraid. There's another gun! Why say it twice? Now… give us that new-fangled gun. So you had another gun hidden. What a surprise! Truly a woman of pleasure, who knows how to lead a man by the nose. But that won't work with us. We have small breasts, but we have brains. Okay. It looks like you've got me. Got it! -Huh!? -It won't work. I took out the bullets. Remember this. Expose yourself and people get hurt. Women who don't know that… all die young! Oh, well… I just try to live as a woman, but I keep getting better at war. Hey! What's wrong, Sutenosuke? Wake up! Damn you! We burned that Mukai Village of yours. Most of its people are dead. Ranmaru and I… cut them down. Tenmao! You bastard! Uh, no. From now, you're Tenmao. -What? -Rejoice! I'll give you the armor, too. You're making me a decoy? The rest of Mukai's people are coming. They're coming to rescue you, but they'll kill you. What do you think? Isn't it good? You think it's going to be that easy? That's why I'm doing it. People are nowhere as strong as you think. You drugged me… I used quite a lot. But I commend you! Only a true ninja could stay conscious. But barely. Shogen… On the back of this mask is a cloth soaked with dream liquor. We'll see how well you stay awake now. So you plan on running away? Leaving me here, in your place? Need I say it again? You are Tenmao. Not a chance! We're out of time! Quickly! All right. It seems the drug is working. Whoever calls you Tenmao, kill them. They are your enemies! You are the Demon King! The destroyer… of worlds. Shall we? Whoa! Tenmao! Get back, Sagiri! He's not here! What?! Where's Sutenosuke, Tenmao?! Sagiri! Sagiri, run! -Sagiri! -Sagiri! Sagiri, get back! Don't, Tayu! -I'll do it. -You can't! Quiet! Sango, move! Sutenosuke?! Idiot! You idiot! Sagiri? You idiot! Sorry, Sagiri. I'm fine now. What's going on… Whoa! They drugged him! -Drugged? -I feel stupid. How did you know? A woman can tell these things. It's good you came around. A man who a good punch doesn't bring around… is not a man. Thank you for all you've done for me. Thank Sagiri for that. No, I just happened to be here. This is fake. He's losing his edge if he thinks this could fool us. I thought so. -Where is he? -He ran. Right! Come on! Tenmao! -Here you are, Tenmao. -Ranmaru! The scouts report… Toyotomi's army is at Shinagawa, and is sending an advance corps here. And Ieyasu is leading it! So he's taking this seriously now… We have to fight! There's no need. We'll abandon this castle. Things have changed. We've lost. -What? -The English sent us a message. They lost to the Portuguese fleet, and they're sailing back home. And so… we'll never take Osaka Castle. There's no point… to this war now. So you're going to run?! Don't worry! We'll rethink this. I'll need some men. Whatever you're planning, I'm taking Ieyasu's head! That will be where I die. That won't do! Why? Because… you're going to die here. Well, that was easy! Tenmao… Don't worry. You go ahead, as arranged. You bastard! What's your scheme?! Destroy Skull Castle… kill Tenmao… and Oda's vassal Mori Ranmaru. -Tenmao… -That's right! Sutenosuke as Tenmao should be dead by now. So that's why… He's wasted as my decoy. He named himself as "thrown away." He wanted to be a sacrifice. Damn you! Don't worry, Ranmaru. I will exorcise your rage. While I live… so will my rule! Damn you! You have served well. Ranbei! Oh, you're alive… Your cheap tricks would never kill Sutenosuke! Well, in that case… Stand back! Why?! Don't misunderstand. If I betray you now… I'm no better than you or Mitsuhide. That, I will not do! You fool! This castle will fall. Which of us will leave… alive? Hold it! No! Ranbei! Will you defend him… to the end?! I have veered… from the path. Come. Have at me, Tayu! You… bastard! Ranbei! Ranbei! Damn you! Tayu! Damn you! That's enough! Ranbei! -That's enough! -Ranbei! That's enough! You chose your path. Now walk without worry… to where the lord awaits. Gantetsusai, give me that blade. It'll dulled from when Sagiri-- Then sharpen it now! I'll go ahead. Hyogo! There'll be lots of them. -Help Sutenosuke! -Me? You can do it. Get going! Right! Come on! This way! Damn! I'm sorry! It worked! Come on! I made it! Hyogo! Well done! You were great! Here's the armor-piercing blade. Careful with it. You only get one chance. I know. Tenmao! Where are you? Let's settle this now! You can't even die right and you think to defeat me? I couldn't before… but I can now. That fancy armor you wrap yourself in is proof of that. What? If you were sure you'd win, you'd have put the real armor on me. You didn't and your weakness showed. It's not skill. You always leave yourself a way out. It's a weakness of heart! What would you know? I know. You turned Mitsuhide against the lord. First him… now the English. You're always wearing someone as a mask. You're always hidden away, moving in the background. If you say so. But what really makes me mad… is that I didn't stop it! As if you could have stopped me! You were off spying. You knew nothing of the lord. Come on, then! I'll make you grovel! You will, will you? I have rage to exorcise, too. You've smashed the lord's face! And now… I'm going to expose yours! It's too bad, Sutenosuke. It looks like… you've wasted your effort. What's wrong? Gantetsusai's blade… can't seem to pierce this armor. Well… we'll see about that. Thanks to this, I've cracked your armor! In that case, why don't I just break it? How about this?! You think you'll beat me with a stupid trick like that? I'm not done yet! Is that allowed? Damn right, it is. To bring you down… I'll use any trick in the book! Beaten, by one such as you! Not just me! I have friends behind me! Friends who carried me through, asking for nothing! Then you shall take those fellow travelers with you. Sutenosuke… you would be best to die as Tenmao, the Demon King. -What? -We did it! It's bad! The castle's full of soldiers! I saw flags with Tokugawa's crest! It's the invasion of the Kanto region! Let's get going! We can't! With that many soldiers, the escape routes will be blocked. What?! I'll draw them off. You get away. Hideyoshi would never forgive anyone who took up arms against him. They'll kill everyone in this castle. Go. I don't want you caught up in this. No! I'm staying with you! He almost killed you and you beat him at last! I won't let you… sacrifice yourself! Sutenosuke… She's come this far for you. You can't deny her now. I know that! I don't intend to get killed! When we're all safely out of Skull Castle… We'll meet again! All right. We've got you now, Tenmao. Did you think you'd get away? What? You call yourself Sutenosuke… but we have learned that you are the real Tenmao. Bring him. I'm sorry, Tenmao! The secret that the real Tenmao was in hiding has been revealed. Why you…! Hideyoshi has already been told that the real Tenmao… is the Man of Earth. He is suspicious by nature. It will look bad if I do not bring back Tenmao's head. There is no escape from this. Prepare yourself for death. I see… So this was his final trap… Right to the bitter end. He never quits, does he. Give me a break! I have thrown away… all that binds me to this world. Thus I call myself Sutenosuke of Sanzu River. Now here, with katana in hand… I throw my life away as well! Ieyasu… will you end this pointless shedding of blood in exchange for my head? Do you promise that? I do. All right. Do as you will. Bind Tenmao! Wait, Ieyasu! Sagiri! We have caught Tenmao. Here. Take the head of Tenmao. Don't be silly! That's just a mask! You know very well Sutenosuke is not Tenmao. Then why? Then why… do you bind him? Does life… Does a man's life… matter so little? If you want a head… then take this mask. An empty mask? It's true. This might be Tenmao. Hanzo, untie him. B-But that's… Don't worry. I'll speak to Lord Hideyoshi. Wait, Lord Ieyasu! Sutenosuke is without doubt Tenmao! Silence, Shogen! Or I'll get mad. B-But… The Man of Mankind is dead. What?! I killed him. That's… crazy. That's crazy! That's crazy! Wait! One more thing. 500 in gold. What? Lord Hideyoshi promised a reward to whoever took Tenmao's head. I think it was 500 in gold. That's enough! A certain samurai once said that before money, we are all equal. You people… Sire! Hanzo, I don't care. Men! Farewell. Listen up! Never show yourselves before me again. Hanzo, leave that bunch alone. But Sire…! Don't worry about the Regent. That Monkey is obsessed with Lord Nobunaga's ghost. Toyotomi's house will fall one day. I will take Skull Castle as my own. It'll be my castle. The Kanto region will be our domain. We'll set our capital here. Here? In these fields? Yes. And one day, it will surpass Kyoto… and Osaka, and the rest of the land! That's the only way to seal the spirit of this Demon King. Bring the horses! That was close! I thought we were dead! You guys sure have a lot of nerve! You're the one with the nerve! Why were you so anxious to die? Well… She didn't want you sacrificed. Surely you know by now what that means. I'm grateful, Sagiri. You drove away the nightmare that's been haunting me. That mask… maybe it really was Lord Nobunaga's head. Money! Money! Open it up! Yeah, open it! One, two! It's all there! 500 in gold! I'll be going. Call me if there's any work you need. What about this? That's okay. I've got these. They're my brother's… They're beautifully honed. You never know what you'll find. I'll tell my husband about it. Bye. Oh, damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! I don't want any of this money… but I have to betray myself! Liar! They call me Sango the Liar! See ya! I'll be going, too. This is enough to buy a fine grave at some temple. Wait! I'll build a grave there, too. For my men who defended you. Okay, Tayu? It's not Tayu. It's Rindo. My real name is Rindo. Call me that. Sure! Where are you going? Well… I've had enough of being a samurai. I'll buy a field somewhere. You'll do what?! What are your men going to think? They'll be laughing at you! Without the Rowdies, who'll keep the Kanto region on the straight and narrow? Brother! As of today, I'm with you! We're going to cut a wide swath… Hyogo! Right! That's what we'll do, Brother. There you go. Maybe we'll even beat Lord Ieyasu's up! That's more like it. Right! Come on, Rin! Rindo? Sure! Sagiri, you take care! Sutenosuke! What about your share? That's your money. Spend it any way you like. Oh, come on! Why don't you ever want anything? Because I'm Sutenosuke. Aw, man! But… I'm going to take that name, and throw it away. What? I'm going to find a new name. A good name for this neck you saved. Fine! With this money I'll build a castle. The right castle for the name you find! Forget that! It's not my style. I've already decided! Hey! Wait for me!
