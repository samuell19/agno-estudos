There is nothing to cover the situation which wiii arise ii one ni us dies. Von scheme think: n¡ everything.

"In the event of the demise of any of the principal: in this enterprise... ...it is hereby understand and agreed... ...that his interest shall reven in its entirety to the surviving principal: nr principal." We have already signed. The way I figure, Simon, it's wise to be prepared for anything in a deal like this. Well, I think I better cnnsult my niece before I sign this. She has a fnurth interest in this deal. But why bnther her? You're her guardian. You have full power of attnrney. Certainly nothing can happen to her. I'm beginning to wish I'd never gone into this. CASTANARO: Trying to back out again, Simon? No. But you know what perchlnric acid is. If that stuff gnt out of hand, there wouldn't be a trace of that ship nr its crew left. We are too far in it now.

Another thing, Simon, that ntüce manager n¡ yours_ Thompson... -...I don't trust him. - Why not? 0h, yes, l was meaning to bring that up too. You see, a note drnpped to the right source could upset this whole applecan.

He died no more than five minutes ago. Oh. Death, one appnintment we must all keep... ...and for which no time set. It's npen-and-shut. This is no murder, McNalley. As far as I can see, the man died of a heart attack. We have a man whn threatened him with a gun. Man would have to be dead whole year to be killed with this gun. Same have not been discharged for many means. 0h, is that so? May I have it, Charlie? I'll give you my report later with an autopsy. Well, thanks, doc. This looks like a cinch. This nu!

You want same? - Nn, I don't think so. - Oh, thank you. Thank you sn much. What's the idea? Well, have certain information. Mr. LaFnntanne was vicüm n¡ attempted kidnapping... ...in front of Chan house last night. 0h, holding out nn me, huh? Well, patience very lovely virtue.

An agreement signed by him and his two partners... ...stating that 'ñ any n¡ them shnmd die, the survivnrs 'mheñt the business. - Excellent motive for murder. - You think so, Charlie? Same motive would also threaten other members of Syndicate. Say, that would affect Rene. - She owns nne-inunh n¡ the Syndicate. - Even so. Please tell me, Swenstrnm still repnse in arms of police? Yeah. The Iunacy boys are giving him a going over. Charlie, I still think that Swenstrnm's attack affected the murdered man's heart. We prove that he's ready for the nuthnuse, and the case is finished. Hello, doc. - Whafs the verdict? - There you are, sir. - Off his trolley, huh? - Nonsense. He's as sane as you are. Heh-heh-heh. Hnnnrable doctor tarnish Iily with gilt. [PHONE RINGS] McNalley speaking. The autnpsy showed what? The chemicai anaiysis indicate: that LaFnntanne died irem poison gas. Poison gas? But how could he be gassed? Ha, ha. That's for you to find out. You're the detective. I'm only the cnrnner. Yeah, but hnwn? Smart gHY- Did you get that, Charlie? Poison gas. Unless expert calculatinns very fnnlish... ...this similar to murder instrument. - Radio tube filled with gas, huh? - Possible solution. - Ynu figure nn account of the broken glass? - With aid of university friends. I get it. The gun was a trick, a cover-up. Swenstrnm put that tube in the radio. At precisem what moment? Mr. LaFnntannEs death is a terrific blow to us, gentlemen. If l ever saw a motive for murder, this paper is it. Are we to consider nurselves under arrest? No. Now, Henri, the nfficer is only trying to do his duty. Pardnn, please. But were listening to radio in office while waiting for Mr. LaFnntanne? - Yes. - I see. And was radio playing when make depanure? Yes, Ithink so. L do not recollect anyone turning it off.

Must harvest vice beinre can bau u. Well, let's see. Sn far, we know that Swenstrnm had a mntive. That is, he thought he had. His formula. Von Scherbe and Castanaro had plenty of motive. The dame with the letter and the guy that tried to steal LaFnntannEs car... ...what about them? Well, have great desire to make careful search of that car. Perhaps that may point finger to true path. Well, I've done everything I can. I've sem out a special bulletin to the traffic squad. Both n¡ you bmndered. You must have, Nita, nr LaFnntanne wouldn't have gone to that Chinese detective. And you, I told you to be careful. What are you kicking about? LaFnntannSs ou! n¡ the way. Yes, but that Chinaman can probably identify you. So I'll attend to him too. Within the next 24 hours, there's gonna be a dead Chinese detective. Hey, Tommy, l ain't going to investigate another parking place. This is the 15th time this morning. And my dogs is killing me.

You were superb tonight, Andre. - When did you do it? - Do what? - Kill him. Castanarn. -l didn't da it. I didn't even have a chance. Well, who did then? We thought you might be ame to !eu us. I don't know a thing about it. Yes, who? Somebody else must be sitting in nn this game. Nonsense. It was done by somebody in this room. - I wasn't nn the premises. - Ynu could have been. You're no! being modas!, are you, Andre? Maybe he doesn't trust us enough to cnnfide in us anymore. I tell you, I didn't do it. - Then why did you leave? - Chan. He's nn nur trail. Ridiculnus. Maybe you won't think it's sn ridiculnus when I tell you he was here tonight. He searched this apartment. GROCK: What are we waiting for? Put that carving knife away. You make me nervous. - What about Von Scherbe? - He'II have to wait. We're going to take care n¡ Chan ürst, tonight. But how can dispnsing of Chan help us get the formula? Mr. Chan will be able to tell us where it is before he meets his hnnnrable ancestnrs. I've been trying to play ball with you as far as I can. I've released your wife. - In time for her broadcast? - Yes. You know who killed LaFontanne and Castanaro, and I know you know it. You think you're safe but you're not. Many a man has gone to the chair for less than we've gnt against you. You are a very Iate caller, Mr. Thompson. Zeal and Inyalty for Iate emplnyer most cnmmendable. Also most dangerous. But, Mr. Chan, Mr. LaFnntanne was more than my emplnyer. He was Kinder to me than a father. And now he's dead. I almost feel it was partly my fault. It is too bad. But can iauen ¡rui! return to branch? No. I repeat, your actions most dangerous. I don't care. His partners in the deal, they're the ones who are responsible. Iwarned him in the beginning. I told him he was playing with dynamite. Would respectfully like to remind you that Mr. Castanarn extremely dead person... ...in same way Mr. LaFnntanne was dispnsed of. Then it's Von Scherbe. He's a crack, an embezzler. South American republics would nab him tomorrow if they had an extradition law. 0h, really? Very interesting. I've been checking up nn him ever since Mr. LaFcntanne went into this deal. I was going to lay the facts before him the day he was killed. I wanna do everything I can to help. Then please do nothing. Then Charlie Chan not have to worry about you too. AII right, you win. I'll tell you the name of the murderer. but if you fail to catch him. it means my life. - We won't fail. - Ynu must take no chances, be very careful. He's a cunning criminal who will stop at nothing. Who is it, Oscar? We'll take every precautinn. What's his name? The name n¡ the man who murdered Simon LaFnntanne and Henri Castanarn... -...is Von Scherbe. - I knew it. - Get a cnume n¡ cars and the boys. SERGEANT: Right. Told you I'd crack this case.

No, no, no, to his office. Right, Bill. I hated to be hard nn poor old Swenstrnm, but it was the only way to break the case. And what happen to Mr. Swenstrnm now? He can gn home. There's no more danger now that the murderer's dead. Well, would suggest Keeping original suspect... ...until all side issues of case are finished. That might be a pretty good idea at that. I'll come up to your house tonight, we can talk the case over. 0h, very nice idea. Would ask you to bring original suspect to house also. Okay. We nught to have a very interesting cnnfab. Yes.
