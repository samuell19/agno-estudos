- [Narrator] 70 million years ago, the creatures known as dinosaurs mysteriously disappeared from the planet Earth. It was thought that they would never be seen again. But in the year 2000, the people of earth were amazed and terrified by the greatest catastrophe ever known to mankind, the reappearance of the dinosaurs. (explosions) - The earth is ours. (explosions) - [Narrator] For millions of years, they had hidden in their secret underground caverns developing an intelligence equal to that of man. And dreadful powers far beyond those of humankind. What was their purpose? Why had they suddenly reappeared? The answer was a fearful one indeed. - You will all be destroyed. (screaming) (ominous music) (explosions) Kill them. Destroy. Destroy them. (laughter) Kill them. (screams) (explosions) - [Narrator] Though some of the creatures are willing to live peacefully underground, they are forced to attack humans by their mad ruler, Emperor Tyrannos, for with his superpowers, he is capable of turning any animal into a murderous beast that will obey his every command. - Now then, (inaudible) - Yeah, your highness. - At ease. Now. - I obey. - [Narrator] On the surface above, there are also some humans who show little regard for living things. But their actions are nothing in comparison to the fiendish ferocity they are about to encounter. (upbeat music) - You will destroy. (dramatic music) (maniacal laughter) - Hey, what are you doing to my dog? Come on, get away from him. Leave him alone. Get going, get out of here. Huh? (screaming) - All the dogs in the sector have turned into red monsters. Don't tell me it's not possible. I'm telling you they're monsters. (barking) (screaming) - [Narrator] At Gemini command headquarters, reports have been received which indicate some form of strange activity within the damaged sector. The Gemini command is a defense squad created to ensure the safety of earth. And it's chief is the well known biologist and physicist, Dr. Don Carmody. Under his command are the four members of the squad. Captain Jim Starbuck. Lieutenant Gem Starbuck. Lieutenants Jerry Forble, and Science officer Lieutenant Wallace Singer. - I'm glad you could come, all of you. We've received strange reports from alpha sector three. Reliable witnesses there tell of monstrous red dogs ravaging the countryside as well as earthquakes and fires. - Did you say these were reliable witnesses? It sounds pretty far fetched to me, doctor. - Be that as it may, we must investigate immediately. - How could such a thing come about? - I can't be positive, but I think it has something to do with the recent underground activity that the geology team has picked up on their seismographs. - I see. - What seems strange to me is that we're being mobilized to deal with the problem. I mean why not the geology team? - If what I suspect is true, they're not equipped to handle the job. - You mean it might have been caused by something attacking us? - I'm hoping that's not the case, but the evidence has led me to that conclusion. Alright. Get going. - [Group] Yes sir, at once. - Bye boots, gotta go now. (upbeat music) - [Narrator] The Gemini command headquarters was specially designed by Dr. Carmody so that the squad would be on it's way as quickly as possible in the case of an emergency. Within seconds, they are ready to go into action. (upbeat music) - Be sure to watch for indications of movement beneath the surface. - [Gem] Analyzer ready sir. - Report as soon as you find anything. - Prepare for launch. - Good luck, and be careful out there. (upbeat music) - [Woman] All personnel, clear the area. All personnel clear the area. Gemini command ship read for launch on pad C three repeat. Pad Charlie three. All personnel clear the area. Launch condition green and in progress. (upbeat music) Attack module docked and ready. Open defense bay doors. Captain Starbuck, you may begin vertical takeoff. (upbeat music) - [Captain Starbuck] Thank you base. VTO completed. - [Gem] Course programed for sector alpha three. - [Man] Field mix, a okay. - [Man] Rockets primed. - Fire rockets. What a catastrophe. I can't imagine what could have caused such damage and destruction. - It wasn't done by the red dogs. At least not by themselves. - That's right. The red dogs. We haven't seen any at all. - Calling Starbuck. - The damage is confirmed, but we haven't seen any sign of the dogs you told us about. - I can't say that I'm surprised. - Doctor, what do you mean? - I just received information that the dogs were seen in delta sector. - We mustn't let them reach the city. - You and Gem may be the only thing that can stop them. - We'll give it everything we've got, Dr. Carmody. - Good luck Gem. (dramatic music) - Look, I think I see them. (dramatic music) - Look at the size of them. - They've turned into monsters. (dramatic music) - [Captain] Prepare Gemini attack module. (dramatic music) - I wouldn't believe it if I wasn't seeing it with my own eyes. - I've specialized in the study of animals all my life. I never thought I'd see monsters. (growling) Those aren't dogs teeth. They're the fangs of a lion. - Let's try the high voltage amplifier gun, but set it on low so they'll be stunned and not killed. - That's it. - It's time to split up. (dramatic music) - I've got them in my sights, Captain. Increasing power, captain. It didn't even slow them down. (dramatic music) - It looks like they're pretty tough, captain. - I see we've underestimated them. We'll have to try the laser gun. - Must we Jim? - It won't be hurt, just knocked out for a while. Then they'll turn back into ordinary dogs. - [Gem] It's worth a try. Laser gun in position. - [Captain] Fire. (dramatic music) - It's working, Jim. We've stopped them. - Well done. - Captain Starbuck. Immediately to the center of the city. A pack of red dogs is attacking. - I think we found a way to stop the, doctor Carmody. Don't worry, we're on our way. Wally, Jerry, did you hear that? - We're right behind you. Let's go. (upbeat music) (screams) (dramatic music) - I'll try the laser gun again. - Right. (screams) (crashing) What is that thing? - You destroy. - What you're looking at is a tyrannosaurus, king of dinosaurs, the most vicious and blood thirsty monster ever to walk the earth. Now with its increased intelligence, it has become a super monster. It may become necessary to use the Gemini transfer. - We'll see. Gem, let's go get him. (dramatic music) Fire zeta rocket number one. - [Gem] Firing now. - Fools, you can't stop me. Earth belongs to us below. What's this? (dramatic music) (screams) - The super monster is attacking the school. Those kids are in danger. Let him have it Gem. Everything we've got. - Firing now. (explosions) (laughter) - Nice try. - His hide is stronger than steel. - I'm afraid my theory was correct. For millions of years, these creatures have been subjected tot he tremendous pressures that exist far beneath the surface. As a result, they've evolved into this almost indestructible form. - To. - The dogs obey him. - They're attacking the children. - Destroy. (inaudible) Attack. Humans are vermin and must be exterminated and destroyed. - It reminds me of my mother-in-law. - What are we gonna do? - What we need is the power of Gemini. You two take care of those dogs while we prepare for bionic transfer and amplification. - Don't worry, captain, we'll take care of those dogs and protect the children. - Remember the time limit captain. Just three and a half minutes. - Roger. Gemini will stop him. - It's too risky. - There are children out there. We've got to save them. - Alright. But remember, more than three and a half minutes as Gemini and you won't survive. - Don't worry doctor. We'll be careful. Are you ready now, Gem? - Uh huh. - Gem. - Jim. - [Both] Gemini. - [Narrator] Dr. Carmody has implanted a special bionic circuit within the bodies of the two squad members that allows them to transfer, combine and integrate their mental, spiritual, and physical selves creating one entity of super human intelligence and power. Gemini. But they can remain joined together for no more than three and a half minutes or as Gemini, they are using energy at a much greater rate than normal human beings. If they don't separate before that time, they will not survive the transfer into their own bodies. (dramatic music) (inaudible) (dramatic music) (screaming) - Gemini over there. (dramatic music) We did it Wally. And the fire is out. Now let's go and take care of our little red doggie friends, shall we. - Right. (dramatic music) Here they come, Jerry. Let them have it. - It'll be my pleasure. (dramatic music) - [Children] Yeah. Huh? - Oh. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] They'd better hurry. Their time is almost up. (dramatic music) - I'll destroy you all. (dramatic music) The sky. (dramatic music) (explosion) (barking) (cheering) - Gemini has saved the children. - That monster wasn't as smart as we thought, Dr. Carmody. He never learned you can't win a fight if you lose your head. - I'm proud of you all. (dramatic music) - You think they separated in time? (somber music) Huh? Hey Jim, time to wake up. - The kids are safe and the monster's been destroyed. - That's great, Jerry. - Thank goodness. - You've done an excellent job. Congratulations. - It looks like your theories were right all along, Dr. Carmody. - And that theory, I'm afraid, will prove my prediction. They have a master plan to annihilate the human race. The super monsters will attack again. - Gemini. You cannot save the human race. (dramatic music) - [Wally] Ready for a lift, captain. - [Jim] Bring her up, Wally. (dramatic music) - [Jerry] Stabilized and secure, captain. - [Gem] Sensors on full and scanning, Jim. - [Jim] Dr. Carmody is sure they'll attack again so keep your eyes open. - [Narrator] Those of the earth defense squad realize that they must always be on guard against the enemies of mankind whose diabolical plans to exterminate the human race must be stopped at any cost. The entire planet has been put on the alert to keep an eye out for any strange activity under the surface. But the two hikers in this remote and isolated region have not yet heard the news, and are taken completely by surprise at what they are about to find. (dramatic music) - Those bats are huge, aren't the. - Boy, there sure are a lot of them. (dramatic music) - What's happened to them? What's going on? (dramatic music) (screams) - Pterock, come. - I am here, oh great and mighty Tyrannos. What is your will? (dramatic music) - [Tyrannos] I have used my powers to infect the bats with the thirst for blood and destruction. Lead them against the humans. - [Pterock] I shall obey. Death to humans. (dramatic music) - Huh, what's that? Look. - Kill and destroy. Kill and destroy all humans. (explosion) You have done well. Emperor Tyrannos will be pleased. - [Narrator] At Gemini headquarters, Dr. Carmody is meeting with the president and the directors of the armaments and defense agency. - I see now why you called it a monster, doctor. - We're lucky he was the only on of that size that we had to deal with. We had a tremendous problem with those red dogs because there was so many of them. - I've never known animals to attack humans so viciously it seemed like they were being driven mad by their need to destroy and we couldn't stop them. - But how is it possible for a dinosaur to have learned our language, Dr. Carmody? It makes no sense whatsoever. - I thought at first that they were extremely intelligent, but now I think that through some fluke of nature, they have become telepathic and know what words to use by reading our minds. I also believe, Mr. President, that they can control the red dogs and other animals through some form of collective hypnotism. - I'm told, doctor, that you think these super monsters will come back. - Uh huh. I'm sure of that. (dramatic music) - Attack. (dramatic music) (explosions) I am a loyal servant of Emperor Tyrannos. my emperor has powers that will cleanse the earth of the vermin called humans. You are doomed. We will destroy you all. (dramatic music) - Hey, that's the alarm. - I wonder what's going on. - [Gem] Emergency. Defense squad alert thousands of monstrous yellow bats have been sighted. The radar scanner showing a huge crowd of them about to attack the city. They're headed directly for-- (screams) - The bats must have gotten to them. - We've got to report this at once. It's the super monsters again, I'm sure of it. - Them again. First they used dogs, now bats. - We can't just sit here and talk about it. We've got to do something. - Uh huh. (dramatic music) - Destroy. (dramatic music) (explosions) - Huh, that's odd. Another power failure. Seems to happen all the time around here. (group chatter) - This is Gem, go ahead. - [Jim] Jim here, it's the monsters again. Now they're using giant bats. - Bats, you say? - [Jim] Yes, doctor. Thousands of them. - Captain Starbuck, get the Gemini command ship here as soon as you possibly can. - [Jim] Right away sir. - Jim, I'll be on the roof in five minutes. So pick me up, alright. - [Jim] I understand. - Tell the squad to stand by. (dramatic music) - We're going to pick up Gem on the roof of the Defense tower. - The sooner the better. It makes me feel strange not having her here. All systems go, captain. - Right, prepare for takeoff. (dramatic music) - [Woman] All personnel, clear the area. All personnel clear the area. Gemini defense squad ready for launch on launchpad C three. Repeat pad Charlie three. Launch condition green and now in progress. (dramatic music) Attack module secure. Open defense bay doors. Captain Starbuck, you may begin vertical takeoff. (dramatic music) - [Jim] Thank you base. VTO completed. - [Jerry] Course program for defense tower, captain. Rockets are primes. - [Jim] Fire rockets. (dramatic music) - Humans must die. Kill them all. - What's going on? What are those things? - They look like giant bats. - That's exactly what they are, gentlemen. They've been ordered by the super monsters to attack us. - So that's it. - It seems unbelievable. - What you are witnessing is the proof of my theories about the telepathic abilities of the dinosaurs. It's the only rational explanation for the behavior of the bats. The only reason they would be attacking this particular building is because their masters knew about this meeting. I suggest we choose a new location for this conference at once. - Hello. Is anyone there? Answer me. The line is dead. - Where's the Gemini force now, Dr. Carmody? - Don't worry, Mr. President. We're still in communication with the Gemini squad. They're on their way. - We better move to the shelter, Mr. President. - There's no electricity. The elevator's out. - We'll have to take the stairs, sir. (screams) The bats are and the building. - We're running out of time. Where's the Gemini squad? - Jim, come on. Where are you? - Gem, we're almost there. Hold on. Go on up to the roof and we'll meet you there in three minutes, alright. - You better hurry Jim. The bats have this building surrounded. - Stay inside. Don't go out until we get there. - If you could use the Gemini transfer. - But you can't do that without her being here. - So we have to get rid of those bats. - We still have those zeta bombs on board. Let's use those on them. Not only would it get rid of the bats, but it won't hurt the people in that building one bit. - Right. We'll blow those bats back to where they came from. - We're coming. Hang on Gem. (dramatic music) Dr. Carmody, we're right outside the building. Under the circumstances, I think we should use the zeta bomb. - Good thinking, Jim. That's an excellent plan. - Get the zeta bomb locked on target and ready for launch right away, Jerry. - Aye aye, captain. (upbeat music) - Bombs away. - You bet captain. (upbeat music) Yay. - Now that they're out of the way, let's go and get Gem. - Huh, captain. - Huh. - It's some kind of flying monster. - I'm taking evasive action. Hold on. Bombs away. - Aye captain. (yelling) - [Jim] Wally, prepare the Gemini attack module for disengagement. Jerry, take over the controls. I'm shifting to the module. Now lower away. - [Jerry] She's armed and ready, captain. (dramatic music) - What was that? - Where is Captain Starbuck and the defense squad? We'll all be killed. - This is the chief of the defense agency. Come in troop commander. Come in. All the communications are out. (dramatic music) - [Mr. President] Oh no, the monster's headed this way. - [Man] Look out. - What a fool I've been. Now I can see what a mistake it was to bring you up here, Gem. I should have realized that splitting up you and Jim would leave us defenseless. - I'm going up to the roof right now, doctor. - Wait. - If we don't make the Gemini transfer, we'll all die. - You're a brave one, Gem. Alright, I won't stop you. Remember, Gem, that's seen by a kind of radar. If you use the radar jamming device on your stun gun, it'll knock them out. Alright, Gem, go on, good luck. (dramatic music) - Oh. (dramatic music) - [Pterock] Destroy all humans. - The monster is ripping the building apart. We've got to stop it, but how. - Perhaps we can distract his attention. - You mean use our selves as bait? - It's a dangerous plan. But in order to rescue Gem, I've got to get it away from that building somehow. - What should we do? - We'll split up the attack module. You'll take Gemini two in the other direction. But first, you've got to fly right by the monster's face so he'll go after you. And while you're distracting him, I'll go and get Gem. - Right. - I'm positive it will work. - The best of luck, my friends. (upbeat music) (dramatic music) - Here he comes. - I think we should say hello, don't you. (suspenseful music) - You'll suffer for that. (suspenseful music) - It's like a hurricane. (yelling) - Ah. Now. - You puny humans. You can't hurt me. (suspenseful music) - Jim, Jimmy. - Jim, what's going on out there? Oh. - Humans, listen to me. I bring you greetings from Emperor Tyrannos. He has an offer for you. You will be our slaves and we will spare your lives. Otherwise, you will all be destroyed. (laughter) - I've got to get down there somehow. - Gem, tell me where you are. - It's Jim. I'm in the conference room with Dr. Carmody. - [Jim] What's going on? - The monsters say they won't kills if we'll be their slaves. - Gem, do you know what's happened to Wally and Jerry? They don't respond to my signal. Gemini two, come in. Jerry, Wally, come in. - Huh? - Huh? - [Jim] The ship is on it's side. You've got to push me over. Then get your ship in the air and try to distract the monster. - [Wally And Jerry] Aye aye, captain. (dramatic music) - Thank you two, and well done. Now let's carry out the rest of the plan. Make him chase you away from the building as fast as possible. - But captain. - The last time he blew us right out of the sky. - Would you rather be slaves for the rest of your lives along with all the other people on earth? Now go on. That is an order. - You're right. I don't even know why I hesitated. - We'll make sure he follows us. Come on, let's go see if our friend wants to play. (suspenseful music) (gun shots) (upbeat music) - Gem. - Jim. - [Both] Gemini. (electronic music) - [Narrator] Once again, the light essences of the two squad members have been bionically amplified and combined to produce the super being known as Gemini. (upbeat music) - I can sense that you are somehow different from the other humans. But I will still destroy you. (upbeat music) (coughing) - Wally, Jerry, you do your job, we will take over now. (upbeat music) Monster, you and your kind are doomed. The people of earth will never surrender to slavery. (upbeat music) - Then you will all die. (upbeat music) - [Gemini] You are mistaken monster. Your defeat is inevitable for you are facing the Gemini force. (upbeat music) - Help me, Tyrannos. (upbeat music) - [Narrator] The three and a half minute time limit is almost up. But Gemini is determined to destroy the monster. (upbeat music) - No. - Gemini. (upbeat music) (explosion) - Hooray. - Good, their time limit was almost up. (soft music) We've beaten them this time, but they'll be back and only the Gemini force can stop them from enslaving the earth. (soft music) - [Narrator] Once again, the super monsters have been defeated by the Gemini force. But who knows what means they will use to try and conquer the earth next time. Whatever it is, the defense squad will be there. (slow suspenseful music) Their setbacks on the earth's surface have not discouraged the super monsters from their plan to take over the world. And the emperor Tyrannos is now commanding his troops. - Attention. It's time to fall out. Alas. (soft music) - Can I help you? Oh, hey Mikey, Gem is here. Yeah, yes she is. - Hi, Gem. - Hello, Michael. Have you finished cleaning the blouse I brought in. - Of course I have. I wouldn't want to disappoint my best friend's sister, would I? It's a beautiful blouse. - Thank you. - There you go. - Oh, you did get that spot out. - [Mikey] Hey, I'm a professional. - It's a big rat. - Oh no. - Look at that. - I'm gonna get you, you ratty rat rat. (upbeat music) - [Narrator] The members of the defense squad soon learn of Gem's experience with the rat. They have know way of knowing that it's connected with the super monsters. - Just look at what that rat did to my blouse. - What a tear. All you can do with this is wash windows. - Or maybe you could start a new fashion. - I hope he at least offered to pay you back for the damage that was done. - Poor Michael felt so bad about what happened, but I wouldn't take a penny from him. - You shouldn't have let him get out of it. It was his fault. - I don't appreciate your telling me what to do with my money or my blouse. - Don't change the subject. That blouse was Michael's responsibility and he let it get ruined. Shouldn't he pay for that? - No. You talk as if you've never made a mistake in your whole life, Mr. Jim Starbuck know it all. Well I have. And when I made my mistakes, I depended on my friends to forgive me. - You're too soft hearted. I'm going to have to talk to Michael about this myself. - Over my dead body you will. This is none of your business. - Oh yes it is. - Oh boy, Wally, this is quite a fight. We could be selling tickets to this. - [Gem] Who do you think you are? - [Jim] I'm your brother and obviously you can't take care of the problem-- - It's merely a case of sibling rivalry. Oh, that signals the end of round one. Wally here. Certainly, he's standing right here. Jim, Michael wants to talk to you. - Speak of the devil. I want to talk to you too. What? No, Anna isn't here with us. - I'm afraid she's lost Jim. She just ran out of here this afternoon and-- - Not back yet? It's almost dark. - I'll find her. She was chasing that rat. - Wait a minute, Gem. I say we call the police. They'll know where to look. It's their job. - [Gem] Oh, stop ordering me around. (slow suspenseful music) - [Narrator] Little Anna has wandered all the way to the other side of the city chasing the rat. - Where are you, you rat? I'll find you if it's the last thing I ever do. (slow suspenseful music) What's that? Is there somebody hiding back there? Ah hah. There you are. I'll get you. Oh, come back here. Come back you stupid ratty rat rat. I'm gonna feed you to my cat. - What on earth? - [Anna] Stop him. Oh stop. He went down the hole. - [Man] What's going on here? - [Anna] Oh, get him. Go get him. - [Man] Little girl lost her dog. - [Man] Oh honey, don't worry. We'll help you find him. (suspenseful music) Here boy, come here boy. Where are you? - [Man] Hey, look at the size of that rat. - [Man] Yeah, they sure grow them big down here. - [Man] Yeah. (slow suspenseful music) - [Narrator] The super monster's ray is now aimed at the rats, making them into glowing red slaves of the monsters from the center of the earth. - [Man] Look at that. There must be hundreds of them. - [Man] I've never seen any rats like this before in my life. Where did they all come from? Look at them. - [Man] I don't know. Here they come. Here they come. - Oh my gosh. - [Narrator] The super monster, known as Ashtoreth controls the rats with the vibrating hum of the armored plates on his back causing them to become blood thirsty fiends. (yelling) - Oh no. Help. Mikey. Get off. Get off. (yelling) Help, Mikey. Help. Help. (dramatic music) - Anna, honey. Are you alright? Anna, what happened? - Oh help, they're chasing me. The rats. The red rats. - The red rats? - But how's the kid, Gem? - Well she wasn't hurt, but she had a really terrible scare. - That must have been a terrible experience. Sounds awful. - Listen, Jim, I think we aught to have the team investigate these rats. - Hmm. Not yet. - Not yet? Those rats are a menace. I told you what they did to poor Anna. What are you afraid of? - I'm in charge. That's it. - Stop it you two. Gem, if I'm not mistaken your brother suspects that Tyrannos and the super monsters are behind all of this. Isn't that so, captain? - Uh huh. - If our suspicions are correct, then these strange rats are a dangerous army. - So, we'll get a whole army of cats. A couple of tons of poison cheese and a million rat traps. No problem. - This is no joking matter, Jerry. This is very serious indeed. And the fate of the whole world may hang in the balance. Is that clear? - Uh huh. - Alright then, let's not waste any more time. - Yes sir. Let's get to work now, Gem. Ready. (upbeat music) - Stand by. - Standing by. - Good luck. (upbeat music) - [Woman] All personnel, clear the area. All personnel, clear the area. Gemini command ship ready for launch on pad C three, repeat pad Charlie three. All personnel clear the area. Launch condition green and in progress. (upbeat music) Attack module docking completed. - Take care. (upbeat music) - Those two had better stop fighting soon. I mean they can't use the Gemini power if they're mad at each other. - They're also head strong. - Carmody here. The rats are probably gathering for a single mass attack. But we haven't been able to find out what their target is yet. You'll have to track them underground. - We'll use ultrasonic detection. - Right. Searching. The main body of the rat pack appears to be moving eastward into city quadrant delta three. - They're target is the central oil refinery. - Why? What reason would they have for going there, Wally? - [Wally] A major fire in the refinery could destroy most of the city. The facility is very well guarded against human beings. But rats could easily penetrate the site's defenses through pipelines, ventilation shafts, sewers. This could be a major catastrophe, captain. (slow suspenseful music) - [Jim] Lower attack vehicle. - [Gem] Already being lowered, captain. (slow suspenseful music) - Picking up subterranean life form readings, captain. Look at that. There must be millions of them. - They planned this attack very well. We can't fire on them or we'll blow up the whole compound. Activate ice gun. - [Gem] Ice gun firing. - [Jerry] Look, they're turning into mice cubes. - Turning into mice cubes. - Over there. What's that? - [Jim] It must be a super monster. (dramatic music) - Tyrannos. - Well done. They'll soon be eliminated. Destroy. Destroy. - Hold on. (dramatic music) - Hey, you know I'll bet we can bring him down if we use the Gemini hooks. What do you say, captain? - Good idea. - Yeah. - Alright now Gem, prepare to launch. - Roger. - And fire. - What? You puny humans will regret doing battle with me. (dramatic music) - I think we've been hit. Fire rockets. (dramatic music) - Rats. To your final victory. Come from the sewers and come from the ditches. Have no mercy on the human beings. (dramatic music) - Oh no, I, I, I I don't believe it. - [Man] Fire on them. - [Man] There's too many of them, sir. (yelling) (dramatic music) (explosions) - It's all going up in flames. - Yeah. - Wally, Jerry, we'll stay behind and fight the super monster, you two go put out that fire. Take Gemini two. - Aye sir. (upbeat music) - Alright, prepare to disconnect. - [Jerry] Preparing for liftoff, captain. And here we go. (upbeat music) - [Man] And we are still receiving unconfirmed reports that a large army of vicious red rats is attacking the central oil refinery. The earth defense squad has been dispatched to investigate. - [Mikey] That does it. - Mikey, what's the matter, Mikey? - Those rats have cause enough trouble. I'm going to see what I can do to help out. - No, - [Man] Do not panic. The situation is very under control. - [Anna] Mikey, oh Mikey. - Laser ready, and fire. Airborne missile. - Jim. - He's tough. (explosions) (upbeat music) - Hey, I think it's working, Wally. We've got it contained. - I always dreamed of growing up to be a fireman. - Rats, we have them in our power. Attack. Attack. Use your teeth. Use your claws. Bring down the human cities. Attack. (suspenseful music) (inaudible) Their machines can't protect them. The earth will be ours. - Well, you know what we have to do. Gemini power is the only thing that can get us out of this situation. Let's get ready. - No, Jim. You must resolve any emotional conflicts between you before attempting bionic transfer. It's much too dangerous otherwise. (slow suspenseful music) - Jim, look, it's Michael. - Oh. - Ah hah. - He might be hurt. Oh no. - Don't go, Gem. Stay here. - Let me go. You may be my brother, but I hate you. - Stop it right now. I'm sorry Gem. But we can't afford to be acting like spiteful children now. We have a job to do. - Wait. (dramatic music) - Stop that. Michael, hurry up and get out of here. - I think I'm hurt. - [Jim] Hold on, I'm coming. - [Ashtoreth] Attack rats. Attack. - This should hold him for a minute. - Hey. - No time to chat. Let's get out of here. - Hold on, Michael. We're coming. - [Ashtoreth] Rats attack. Attack. - It's too dangerous. You go ahead. - Oh, be quiet, Michael. (dramatic music) - [Gem] There's the basket. - [Jim] Alright, let's strap him in. - [Gem] Okay. - [Michael] I'm fine, you go ahead. - [Gem] You alright? - [Michael] I'm fine. (dramatic music) - Let's go. He'll be alright with them. - [Gem] Right. We have to stop that stegosaurus. (dramatic music) - Run. Run. (dramatic music) - Hey big brother, you know I really don't hate you at all. - Nothing can ever beat us as long as we stay together as a team. - Right. - Gem. - Jim. - [Both] Gemini. (electronic music) - [Narrator] Through the scientific miracle of bionic transference and amplification, brother and sister once again join forces to create a single super force much more powerful than the sum of it's two parts. Gemini. - Gemini force. - [Narrator] Time is beginning to run out. Gemini must complete the mission within three and a half minutes or both Gem and Jim may lose their lives. - Human scum. (upbeat music) - Unfortunately those rodents are superior arsonists, aren't they. - [Jerry] Those red devils can go to-- - That's it. - What? - We can exterminate the whole problem by sending those rats into the proverbial fiery furnace. What do you think? - Sure, Wally, sure. Whatever you say. - Gemini, this is science officer Singer. Listen, I think I have it all figured out. He controls the rats with the fins on his back. If we can stop him from transmitting those vibrations, then we'll break his power over them. The fins, hooray. - You're right. (upbeat music) Rotary blades are set. (upbeat music) - Gemini, it's working. The rats are confused. Now we'll put out those fires. - [Jerry] Yeah, but we're gonna leave one burning. - [Wally] Roger, then we'll use our own sonic devices to guide those little rats right into it. (upbeat music) - [Jerry] Hey look Wally, it's working. The rats are all running into the fire. - [Wally] Of course it's working, Lieutenant Fordham, it was my idea. - We're the best. - Right. Right. Right. - [Narrator] Only 30 seconds left of the Gemini force. - Let's finish him off. (upbeat music) - I've got you now. Help me. (explosion) - That's right. - Right. Right. (upbeat music) - [Jim] I did not lose my temper. - [Gem] Oh no, well what do you call it when-- - [Jim] I call it getting the job done. - [Gem] There's only one way to settle this. - [Jim] Yeah? What? - [Gem] Let's be friends. - [Jim] Sounds like a good deal to me. (upbeat music) - [Narrator] Three months pass, and the earth defense squad is waiting for the super monster's next attack. But things have been pretty quiet for our heroes. - [Jim] And checkmate. - Oh no. - [Jim] You walked right into it. - I hate chess. - [Narrator] In fact, you might even say that things have been down right dull. - I know, hearts. - [Jim] Oh please. - [Narrator] But maybe this lull is just the calm before the storm. - Emergency. Emergency. - Have the super monsters come back again? - No, no, no, I can cope with super monsters. This is a real emergency. He's busted out and gone on the lamb. - Who? - Do you know a criminal? - Oh my goodness, no. My friend Sam's not a criminal. He's a central or a South American herbivorous tree dwelling mammal commonly called a sloth. - What's a sloth? - Here's a mugshot of little Sam. He ran away from the zoo this morning. - He's adopted another animal. - Oh forget it. - Forget it? That tree sloth is like a son to me. - Sorry. - Uh oh. - [Narrator] As the earth defense alarm sounds, the team rushes to the office of Dr. Carmody. - Sir, the squad is reporting. - This is a real emergency. The super monsters have sent a triceratops to the outer suburbs of the city. - So close? - Die. (screaming) Humans must die. - [Dr. Carmody] You'll have to move out immediately. - We're on our way sir. - You'd better believe the squad's on its way. Let's go. - Boarding chute, activated. (upbeat music) - Prepare to launch attack vehicle. - All systems A okay. (upbeat music) - [Woman] All personnel clear the area. All personnel clear the area. Gemini command ship proceeding to pad C three. Repeat, pad Charlie three. (upbeat music) - Gem, ahead full. - [Woman] Launch condition green and in progress. (upbeat music) - Lift off rockets checked and ready. (upbeat music) - [Woman] Attack module docked and ready. (upbeat music) - Defense bay, roger. - [Woman] Being vertical takeoff. - Liftoff completed. (upbeat music) - Death. Death to the human race. It is the will of Tyrannos. (dramatic music) Run you humankind. - Sound vehicles away. (slow suspenseful music) Charge and prepare to fire laser guns on my command. - All charged. - Alright, take aim and fire. - You and your stupid human toys. Prepare to die. (explosions) Where are they? - He's unusually strong. - The Gemini rockets will take care of him. - Firing. (explosions) - Well we sure made that lizard crawl back under his rock. (laughter) - Damages are minimal from this attack. What a relief. - That monster could have done a lot worse. I think we just got lucky. - Captain, I want to hurry back to base and start looking for Sam. He's all by himself in the big city. - Let him have some fun. - Sorry. It can wait. I have a feeling that monster will come back. - Well Sam's probably drinking fermented banana juice and swinging from a downtown lamp post. - Oh, don't tease him, Jerry. I'm sure the zookeepers will find Sam. They know just what to do in cases like this. - Well I hope so. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] Jim's intuition was correct when it told him the monster was coming back out from under its rock. (dramatic music) - Run. You can't hide. (yelling) Witness my power. (slow suspenseful music) (yelling) - You were right Jim. It's come back. (dramatic music) - Fire missiles, Gem. - Target marked. - Let him have it again. Fire. - Firing. (explosions) - Cowards. - Fire the complete battery. - Roger. (explosions) (slow suspenseful music) - Looks like he's gone underground again. - Yeah, we hurt him pretty bad. I don't think that monster will be back again. He's finished. - Hmm. - You're right, Gem. We won't be seeing any more of him. Now we can head over to that TV tower and rescue those people. - I love being a hero. - Put the heroics on hold. - Huh? - There something funny about-- - Is your Gemini sense again, Jim? - I just don't get it Gem. Why would that super monster keep on fighting us like that after we'd injured it so badly. - Well I supposed the emperor Tyrannos gave it specific orders to come up and destroy this part of the city. - But why would he waste a good soldier? That suburb is small potatoes. - That's a very good point, Jim. - I'll be they just want to keep us tied up here while they stage a main attack someplace else. - But what about all the people in the tower? - Wally, don't worry. We'll call the earth defense relief and rescue team to take care of that problem. It's really their job. - Hold on Jim. If we go back to the base now, all those people might be killed before the rescue team gets here. Being on the spot makes us responsible for them. So quite wasting time and start the rescue operation. (screams) - That's what the monsters want. Now leave it to the rescue team. - The rescue team won't be here for at least another half hour. The super monsters want to kill people and it's our duty to stop them, not help them. - Don't tell me my duty. - Tell me, Jim, there's a rumor going around the base that when the professor installed your Gemini circuitry, he also took out your heart. Tell me, is that true? Huh? Is it? - Shut up. We have our own assignment and if you can't cooperate, then you can get off the team. - I'm off the team as of this second then sir. I know my job. - Come back here. - No, Jerry, wait. (upbeat music) (slow suspenseful music) - You pathetic excuse for a super monster. How dare you show your scaly face to me. You know what you are (inaudible). A coward. You'll keep the defense squad occupied. - Thank you, Tyrannos, thank you. Thank you sir. - [Narrator] Jerry is doing what he can by himself to save the people in the tower. - Look, the super monster's back. - Jerry, get out of there. (explosion) (yelling) - No. Let's get him. Fire missiles when ready. - Missiles marked. (screaming) - [Ashtoreth] Tyrannos, help me. Tyrannos. - Now, I finally have that defense squad where I want them. And they'll soon be meeting my greatest player. (slow suspenseful music) - [Narrator] This new threat from the super monsters is soon picked up on the defense squad's sensitive radar system. (slow suspenseful music) - Jim, a new type of monster has appeared. - What? - This one's more dangerous than the others. It's blowing radioactive particles into the atmosphere which could make that sector poisonous for a hundred years. - Where is it? - About 20 miles north of your present location. You haven't got much time. There's a storm headed in that direction. You've got to destroy the monster before the high winds scatter the poison dust over the entire continent. - We're on our way, doctor. - Jim, you were right about our responsibilities. - Uh huh. Wally, you better find Jerry. - Jim, before I go, let me say that I respect you even more than I did before. And you made the right decision. You're a fine captain. (slow suspenseful music) - Jim, what's the matter? - I'm still a little dizzy. - Better rest a minute. - I'll be fine. Let's go. - Aye aye, Jim. (dramatic music) - Jerry, where are you? (dramatic music) Out cold. I just gotta wake him up. - That's a heck of a way to wake someone up. - Sorry Jerry. I had to wake you up as fast as I could. We've got another one of those monsters on our hands, and it's the worst one yet. (dramatic music) - The monster must be nearby. The level of radio activity is higher. - He's in this area, alright. We've got to stop him. Ready, Gem? - Ready, Jim. - Ow. - You all right, Jim? - It'll pass. Let's go. (dramatic music) Fire the harpoon gun. - Firing now. - Fire another harpoon, Gem. (dramatic music) He's a tough one. Let's try the laser. - Firing laser. (dramatic music) - I think he's weakening. Fire the rocket gun. - Firing now. (dramatic music) (explosions) - Bullseye. (slow suspenseful music) - Still there. He's a lot stronger than I thought. - We're going to have to use the Gemini transfer. - Right. - You can't Jim. Your readout on the bionic scanner shows you have a damaged circuit. A transfer would be extremely dangerous. - I was afraid something like this might happen. If they can't make the Gemini transfer, then what are we gonna do? - If we don't, we can't stop him. - You won't make it, Jim. - Gem, we've got to try. - You could die, Jim. - We can't waste time. The whole district is being covered with radioactive dust. We've got to stop the monster now. Gem. - Jim. - [Both] Gemini. - [Narrator] Once again, the two squad members undergo Gemini transfer combining their life essences. But the damaged bionic circuit in Jim's transfer mechanism has interfered with the transference process. If they are forced to reverse the transfer in the middle of an attack, their chances of surviving are slim, indeed. But the risk must be taken for in order to stop the monster, they need the power of Gemini. - [Gem] Hurry Jim, that circuit will burn out soon. - I'm attacking now. (dramatic music) I'm going to try freezing it with the ice ray. Now that the super monster is frozen, I'll finish it off. (dramatic music) Blast it. Now there are two of them. - I got them. (inaudible) Attack. Attack. (explosion) - [Gem] Are you alright? - Don't worry, Gem. The Gemini ship won't move. I think it's stuck, Gem. - Jim, move. - Attack. Free him and join forces. Attack. (dramatic music) - We're gonna help them. Let's go. (dramatic music) - Jerry, what are we gonna do, huh? - Attack the monster, of course. - But what can we do? They'll tear us apart. - What's important is making the attempt, right. (dramatic music) (explosions) - Jim, Gem, get of there you two. There's hardly any time left at all. (playful music) - Kill them. Destroy them. (yelling) (soft music) - I'm gonna ram it and blow him to kingdom come. - We'll be killed. - You won't my friend, farewell. - Jerry. Don't do it Jerry. (soft music) - [Jerry] This is Jerry, I'm going to ram one of the monsters. The explosion should destroy them both. - Jerry, wait a minute. There must be another way. - Jim, Gem, it's all my fault you're in this mess to begin with. And I'm gonna make it up to you if it's the last thing I ever do. - No. - Goodbye Gemini. - Don't do it. (soft music) - [Gem] I'm releasing full energy. I just hope that circuit lasts long enough. - But if it doesn't, you'll be trapped forever. - [Gem] If Jerry's willing to risk his life for us, I'm willing to do the same for him. - I agree. Gem, I'm beginning to feel it. - Gemini. (upbeat music) - You've only got 12 seconds left, Gemini. - It's Gemini's responsibility to destroy the enemies of humankind. (explosion) (soft music) - Jerry. - I'm sorry I caused so much trouble. - Forget about that. I'm just grateful we're both alive. And thanks for rescuing the people in the tower. - Thanks captain. It was my pleasure, and I promise I will never disobey again. Probably. - Huh? Oh you. (laughter) - Welcome back squad. Congratulations on the fine job you did today. Wally, you have a visitor. He's been hanging around waiting for you. - A friend of mine? - Uh huh. He's waiting right over there. (soft music) - Sam. You came back. - Now I see what Dr. Carmody meant when he said your friend was hanging around. - It's a monkey and a raccoon combined. - Sam, come on. Come on down. Come to uncle Wally. Come on Sammy. Come here you brown fuzzy little freak. (laughter) (upbeat music)
