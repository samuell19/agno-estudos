Well, hello there. This is your old cousin Brucie here. Hey, it's graduation clay today at Hometown High. No more school. Yeah, wow! All that free time in the bright sunny sunshine. Ready for the three R's? Rest, relaxation and racing your girlfriend around the room. Wee! I just get tired thinking about it. Come September, off to college and kiss your sweetheart goodbye. Gee, I know I'm gonna miss you. Sob sob. Enough of that. So tell me, what are you gonna do this summer? Lie around the sun and sand with nothing to do. Lazy! Hey, I got a song here that might give you a few ideas. Start your summer off with a great big bang. It's the number one smash. Love is a Gas. # You can do it right in your hearts # # Or even when you're not # # You can do it fast # # Or slow to make it last # # 'Cause any way you do it # # There's gonna be magic to it # # 'Cause love, love, love, love is a gas # # Anyway you do it # # There's gonna be magic to it # # 'Cause love, love, love, love is a gas # Someday! As I look out at your young, fresh, clean, smiling faces and at the faces of your relatives, friends and beloved parents. My heart is warmed to see the strength of character and moral fortitude which all of us, the faculty and staff of Hometown High have strived to instill into you young men and ladies. You're no longer the children you once were when you first stepped into these forbidding halls. I am reminded of the first time I stepped into these same forbidding halls, 25 years ago. I was a young man just out of college with a degree clutched tightly in my hand and yet, even armed with that piece of parchment, I, even I, was awed by the mighty responsibility also being placed in my hand to mold and shape the minds and personalities of the flower of our American youth. I hope and pray that you are not awed by that same mighty responsibility now being placed into your hands. You will be the businessmen, and congressmen, the leaders and teachers, the artists and doctors of tomorrow. From all of us at Hometown High, to all of you, the next generation of American men and women, congratulations, and God be with you. And now for a delightful musical program prepared by our lovely students, in honor of this very special evening. # Hometown High we honor thee # # Alma mater true # # Faithful Titans we will be # # Through the years to you # # I love my Hometown High # What a dirty, rotten trick. Yeah! Who do you think did it? I don't know, but when we find out, we'll fix him. The nerve. Imagine them getting a free look like that. Hey, April, you getting dressed, or do you plan to stay naked permanently? I didn't think it was so bad. Uh, oh. This girl's in big trouble. Take it easy, honey. Come back down to planet earth. It was nice having all those boys looking at me. I can't explain it, but it felt good. I wish they'd look at me that way. Maybe it did feel good, but that's a secret you should keep to yourself. Never give away something for nothing. Why? 'Cause, baby, that's the way it goes. You play your cards right, you can wrap them around your little pinkie, like me. Then they do what you want them to. And that's what makes the world go round. Oh, come on, Betty. Don't lay it on that thick. She's just a little confused. Well, gather round, class. Time for a little education. I know you all have your diplomas, but this is the real stuff. Boys all want the same thing. You know what I mean? Yeah. Good. You've heard about it, then. Now, as some of you may already know and as Miss Luscious Lips over here is suddenly finding out, what they want is not too bad. But you can never let them know that. While your body says, Yes. Your pretty little mouth, should say no. That way they have to work at it and work at it. And when you finally do give in, just a teeny-weeny little bit, they're so grateful, they'll do anything. And I do mean anything. Yeah! All right! You done good. Thank you. Tickets. Hey, look at that one! A real angel, huh? Whoa! Hey, look at me, I'm an angel. Hey! Hey boys, hey boys, I'd like you to meet my date. This is, uh, hey, I didn't catch your name. Oh, yeah, this is Moitle. Say hello to the boys Moitle. Ding dong! Hey! Who you calling ding dong, huh? I wouldn't call you a name, Hank. Yeah, well see that you don't. _ Dope! Hello, Mr. Smith. My name is Anthony Morelli. My friends call me Peewee. I just dropped by to pick up your little angel, Moitle, take her to the dance. Hey, so what do you think, huh? You think this place is worth our dime and trouble, huh? Yeah. You know, you think we'll get a little appreciation, huh? Yeah, I think so. All right! Let's join the crowd. Certainly. After you, boys. Thank you. Hey, hey, Butch. What are you guys doing over there? Well, if it isn't Andy Hardy. Hey, what are you guys doing out here? We're giving our bikes a little grease job. At night? Yeah, yeah! The moonlight's very good for that sort of work. And the music soothes the nerves, of which I got plenty. Uh, didn't I see you at the graduation today? Oh, so you're the guys who did that, huh? Hey, how'd you like a rear axle up your nose, huh? Hey, you guys. Get out of here. What are you doing? Come on, get out! Get out of here! Uh oh, we're running low on gas. It looks like we'll have just enough to get stranded at Lookout Point. Roger, you just pull this car right into my Uncle Joe's gas station. Hmm. Would you like a tiger in your tank? Excuse me, I have to go to the little girl's room. Juney, Juney! Oh, Uncle Joe. Hey! My favorite niece. Let me have a look at you. You having fun? I'm okay. How about you? Awful, just awful, but, things could be worse. You don't look so bad to me. It's inside, it's in my veins, it's in my bones, it's my stomach, it's in my back, I've got a strange, creeping pain here. Uncle Joe, there's really nothing wrong with you. You know you shouldn't let the boys see you doing that. Oh, don't be silly. Close your eyes. Think about all the good times we've had together, all the tears, and all the laughter. This is like, this is like the crossroads in our lives. From here we all go our own separate ways. I mean this could be the last time that we'll ever see Hometown High. Look into my eyes. This could be the last time we'll ever see each other. Okay, boy. I am sorry! Hello! Mom, is that you? What's happening? What's it with you? You think you're Woody Woodpecker? What's wrong? Oh, it's this damn crick in my neck, been bothering me for days. Oh, you mean your husband. He's had a mild heart attack. You know, June came here especially to see you. Juney, Juney. My favorite niece. I'm right here, Uncle Joe. How do you feel? Oh, I get these creeping pains going through here and all around there. Stay away from that! I think we should leave now. Quiet, quiet! Can't you leave a dying man in peace? He's really very upset. You'll just have to excuse him. It looks like we're gonna have to sell the gas station now. He loved that little place so much. He used to say, "It ain't much but it's ours". He was struggling so hard against competition from that big new station across the street. But now that he's sick, there's just no way. Don't worry, Aunt Harriet. It'll be all right. I'm sure of it. I wish there was something I could do to help. You're such a sweetheart. # I'm lonely and I don't want to be # # Don't know why these feelings have come over me # # I'm lonely and I finally see # # How I need the people who are close to me # # Just give me all of my friends and I'll be happy again # # Oh, bring them back home where you know they belong # # Just give me all of my friends and I'm in heaven again # # Feeling like the whole world is singing along # # Oh, I'm lonely and I don't wanna be # # I want a life of love and of harmony # # I'm lonely and I finally see # # How I can make this dream come true for me # # Just give me all of my friends and I'll be happy again # # Oh, bring them back home where you know they belong # # Just give me all of my friends and I'm in heaven again # # Feeling like the whole world is singing along # # To a song that says we'll always be near # # You'll never be lonely again # # It's a song that says there's nothing to fear # # We'll be with you till the end # # Just give me all of my friends and I'll be happy again # # Oh, bring them back home where you know they belong # # Just give me all of my friends and I'm in heaven again # # Feeling like the whole world is singing along # # Singing along # # Just give me all of my friends and I'll be happy again # # Oh, bring them back home where you know they belong # # Just give me all of my friends and I'm in heaven again # # Feeling like the whole world is singing along # # Just give me all of my friends # That's it! Here's this morning's receipts, boss. Thanks, Louie. Well, let's see, towing operations up 10%, auto accessories up 8%. You boys are working hard. Yeah, thanks, Mr. Friendly. Seems to be some activity across the street. What? I thought that old geezer was laid up, or better yet, dead. Look at them dumb broads wiggling their little asses, huh? That old fart really lost his marbles this time, didn't he? Look at that, Louie. We got, we, we got competition. Hey, this place looks pretty good. It's beautiful. I love it. What the hell is that? This is embarrassing. I don't know how I ever got talked into this. How do you use this thing? Oh, it's not hard. First you grab hold of the nozzle, like this. That turns it on. Right. Then you stretch it out. It can get pretty long. Then you stick it in a car, and you squeeze. And the gas comes squirting out? Right. How do you stop it? Oh, it trickles off by itself before the tank overflows. Can I hold it? Sure. Gee, I hope I can remember everything I have to do. Don't worry. It's just four easy steps. Grab it, stick it in, squeeze it and let it peter out. I have never felt so foolish in my whole life. Ah, I couldn't help noticing you pretty young girls all lined up here. Is this some sort of practical joke or something? I mean, just what is it you're selling here? ' Gas! You mean to tell me you're gonna pump gas into my little old pickup truck here? Would you like regular or super duper? Shoot! You girls wanna look under my hood? I've been having awful trouble with my transmission. Seems like every time she overheats, she rubs up against my piston rods, causes my lube valves to overflow all over my crank shaft. Just shoots the carburetor all to hell and makes my ball joints a mess. Excuse me. Hello, Roger. How are you? Are you busy for the next couple of weeks? How'd you like to spend them with me? Good. Listen, get some of the other guys and come on down to Uncle Joe's gas station. I mean, you guys are so good with cars and engines and all of that stuff, right? Let's go check out this station. What did they say? They said they decorated it or something. Are you kidding me? Is that it? Joe's Super Duper Station. I don't believe this. I love it. Hey, girls. Hey! Oh, would you look at Betty. Hey! Come on, let's go check this thing out. My God, they really did a job. Hey, what's going on here? We're running the place. Just you and the girls? WOW! I had a dream like this once. I loved it, I loved it! You're one kooky chick, but I love you anyway. Oh, come on, Roger. What do you think? It could work. Oh, Roger. I never knew how sweet you are. Yeah but, but we could- Hi, gorgeous. Can I help you with anything? Yeah, could you hold this for me while I go to the bathroom? Sure. # Ooh, I wonder # # What's this spell I'm under # # I wonder what you got over me # # I wonder what's this spell I'm under # # I wonder what you're gonna do with me # # You look into my eyes, I'm hypnotized # # You look into my soul, I'm under your control # # I wonder what's this spell I'm under # # I wonder what you got over me # # You give me your caress I'm powerless # # You give me your sweet kiss I'm down on my knees # # I wonder # # What you gonna do with me # I hope they're not too tight.

Signed, Arthur. No, no, no, no. This one's for real. Signed, Cindy. Well, Cindy, here is that song, you asked for number one on the charts and still climbing, Love is a Gas! Okay, don't step on the brakes until I tell you. Right. Hi. What are you doing up here? What? Nothing! What are you doing up here? I thought you might like some company.

Hey, what do you guys want here anyway? Hey, this place is open to the public, isn't it? Yeah, and we're part of the public, right? Yeah, the public nuisance.

Come on. # Baby, don't say never # # 'Cause never is a long long time # Hey! Yeah, that'll be, uh, $6. Aww. I can't think of another thing. It's a dirty rotten trick! Yeah, so what do you expect? What a world. What a world. Hey, I got an idea! Why don't we go over to your mother's house for dinner, then we could get all the gas we need. I was at your mother's house last night. Oh, yeah, your mother's- Hey, no more mothers. June, you did everything you could. You've got nothing to be ashamed of. Look at it this way. Well, we almost won. Well, at least I can get rid of this silly costume. Poor Uncle Joe. So, you kids learned your lesson, huh? I thought I'd just come over and take a look before you all disappear. This'll teach you kids, this a business, not a picnic. You thought you could compete with me. What a monster that man is! Are you just gonna sit around and stand for that? I guess so. No, we can't! Are we gonna just let him walk all over us like that? And you call yourself a Vulture. I thought Vultures fought for their rights. But, we did the best we could. And are you just going to sit around and mope? Well, maybe we should do something. And you, Roger. Are you willing to give up so easily? Uh, well, I, uh, I guess not. Look at you. All of you. Maybe Mr. Friendly is right. No, he's not right. He's a punk. Yeah, we're with you all the way. We'll show him. Count me in. We're behind you. All right. No, no, no. Hi, Big Sam. Oh, hello there, sweetheart. Sam, what's going on? Going on? I don't know what you mean. There ain't nothing going on. You haven't been around to see me for a while. Oh, they changed my route. Sam. You ain't gonna cry or nothing now are you? Look, I think they're giving you a raw deal, too. But it ain't up to me. You do know what's going on. Ah, this jerk, Friendly put Smin up to it. Smin's the big boss. Smm? Yeah, he's a real oily character. How do I get to see him? Nobody gets to see him, not unless he's some goddamn Arab sheik or something. Oh, please, I've got to. Look, when I pull out of here, follow my truck. # The road's closing in on you # # And you don't know what you gonna do # # And you feel like there's nothing groovy # # You gotta keep on moving # # Keep on moving keep on moving # # Keep on moving # # Keep on moving keep on moving # # Keep on moving # # And when the pressure's getting strong # # And everything is going wrong # # And you feel like you're gonna move # # You gotta keep on moving # # Keep on moving keep on moving # # Keep on moving # # Keep on moving keep on moving # # Keep on moving # Where do you think you're going? In there. No way, fella. # Keep on moving # # Keep on moving keep on moving # # Keep on moving # # Keep on moving keep on moving # # Keep on moving # # Don't let them catch you standing still # # Make your life just what you feel # # The only thing you gotta do # # ls keep on moving # # Keep on moving keep on moving # Well, what do we do now? I've got an idea. What? Tell the boss that the sheik and his entourage are here to have a word with him. What part of Arabia are you from? The west side. - The north side. The northwest side. Ah, Sheik. So good of you to come. Well, what can I do for you? ' Plenty. What is going on around here? We're from Joe's Super Duper Service Station. Joe's Super... Oh, Joe's Super Duper Service Station. Get out of here at once or I'll call the police and have you all arrested for trespassing. If you make a move towards that phone, me and my friends are going to have to trespass over your face. No, no, no. Let us not be too hasty. After all, we're all reasonable men. I'm sorry, my clear. I really am. What a shame. I wish there was something I could do. You're such a lovely young lady. Why would you want to be in such a business anyway? Nevermind that. I just want to know why you can't ship us any gas? It's very simple, my clear. Because we don't have any to ship. We have our troubles too. Everyone's got troubles these days. Our profits are down, down- What about that? 'Hmm? Oh, how clumsy. The cleaning staff, they turned it upside down. Anyway, as you can see, there's really nothing I, I can do. Maybe you would like a job as my personal secretary? You're the meanest man I ever met. Now look what you've clone. Why do you say that? Do you think that just because you've got all the money and power, you can play with everyone's life? Now, now, now, just a minute, young lady. My Uncle Joe worked all his life just to make a few pennies and a decent living and then you go and take it all away. Business is business. It's not just business. That terrible guy across the street, he pulled every dirty trick in the book to try to stop us. And you helped him. He even sent men over to rob us. Now, I didn't know that. Let me tell you the whole story. And that's what happened. That is the saddest story I ever heard. I don't want to hurt people. I never wanted to hurt people. Do you think I like having the fate of millions of people in my hands? I need some time to think about it. Just don't take too long. Hey, Uncle Joe! Hi, Uncle Joe. Juney! How's business? Oh, can't complain. Do you think those things are good for you? The best. Just what the doctor ordered. You know it's a miracle what you did for your old Uncle Joe. Oh, it was nothing. Just wait till next year. Listen, my friends are waiting, I gotta go. See you later. Bye. Hi, you ready to go? Let's go. You ready? All right! - Go! Bye. She always was my favorite niece. Well, it's the end of a beautiful summer.
