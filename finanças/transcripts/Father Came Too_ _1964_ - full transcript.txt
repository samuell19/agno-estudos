There's no point in us both getting wet. - No, well good bye till lunchtime Mrs. Munro. - I'll think you every minute till then Mr. Munro.

(inspirational music) (dramatic music) (groaning in pain) - Don't worry, I saw everything, it was self defense. How terrible. - Well, I thought it was rather good myself. - Aye? - We were only rehearsing my play, A Knife in the Back. I play the leading role. - At the Royal, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. - One or two still available, Store's half a crown, bench is one and six. - I’m looking for a house. - Who isn't? Kindly deal with this person Miss Ledgeworth, will you? - l'm looking for something small, Well built, and not too expensive name. - Name? - Dexter Munro, and l'm already on The books of seven other estate agents. - Address? - Elsinore, Beacons Cross, care of Sir Beverley Grant. - Sir Beverley Grant? - Yes. - Are you staying with him, sir? - Well, he's my father-in-law. - Really? I'll deal with this gentleman, Miss Ledgeworth. - Oh, that's kind of you. - Yes, not at all. Your father-in-law, what a marvelous actor. I model my belch on his. And did you see his bottom at the Old Vic, tremendous. - Yes, but about the house. - Oh yes, of course, you'd like to do something right away would you? - Well, as soon as possible. - Well, how about this afternoon? My services are always at a client's disposal, even on a Saturday afternoon. - But Roddy, you promised you'd take me... - Another time, another time Miss Ledgeworth. - I don't want to spoil anything. - No no, not at all. Just gonna play tennis, you know. We’ll play another game tonight instead, won't we yes? Yes, now I'll pick you up at three o'clock At Elsinore this afternoon, is that all right. - Oh yes, it's very kind of you. - Not at all lad. Sir Beverley will be there won't he? - Well, I expect he will. - I'll certainly be there at three o'clock. Glad to have been of help, good day then. My foot is on the first rung of the ladder, Miss Ledgeworth. Everyone tells me I must turn professional. Now if I can get Sir Beverley to give me an audition... - Could you get me one too, Roddy? - Well now first things first, Lana. It's what I've always wanted. With my acting ability, and my sex appeal, Nothing can stop me. I can see my name flashing in Piccadilly right now, Roderick Chipfield, Roderick Chipfield. - Sir Roderick Chipfield. - We mustn't rush things. (giggling) - [Miss Gadsgill] Wedgewood Travel Agency. - Good morning. - [Miss Gadsgill] Can I help you. - Good morning, Miss Gadsgill. Good morning, Mr. Donovan. Morning, Miss Marthrop. It's still coming down in buckets outside. Sorry I'm a few minutes late, Mr. Wedgewood. Still searching for the house. I'll make up for lost time, don't you worry. (contemplative music) (calm music) (romantic music) (fast paced music) - Juliet, I've fixed up a foursome for us. - You'll have to count us out. - Why? - We're going to look at some houses. - What for? - Dexter wants to buy one. - What's the matter with this one? It's warm, comfortable, spacious, furthermore it has the measure of being free. - Dexter appreciates that. - Well what's the matter with him then? - Don't you know, he just married. - He's only himself to blame for that. Why should I be made to suffer? This house needs a woman in it. - Well darling, you have got Lang. - Lang, what have you been keeping from me all these years? - Daddy listen, Dexter and I want a home of our own. We like to be alone occasionally. - Oh excuse me sir, hold it. (camera clicks) - Are you suggesting that l'm in your way? - Well, you are a bit of an old goose berry sometimes. Isn't he Dexter? - Well, yes, sometimes. I mean well, not exactly, only you know. - I should hope not. Anybody could live here without knowing of my existence. I'm calm, considerate, self effacing, And altogether delightful. - Yes, but... - People usually pay to enjoy my company. You have it for nothing all the time. Now go and get your clubs, I shall be in the car. - Ah, Sir Beverley Grant, if I'm not mistaken. Off for a quiet game of the old Scotsman's croquet, hey? - Who are you? - Roderick Shipfield sir, estate agent. And occasional sterling player. - Are you the individual who was endeavoring To sell my son-in-law a house? - Yes sir, I have that privilege. - My son-in-law does not require a house. My daughter prefers to remain with me. - If I may say so sir, who can blame her? - So there is no point in your hanging around. Well? - Can I ask a favour of you, sir? - What is it? - I’d be eternally grateful if you'd come and see my performance in A Knife in the Back At the local hall on Thursday night. I've not only written the play sir, I'm also directing it, And playing the leading role, a sex mad killer. - Thank you very much, indeed. - Then you'll come, sir? - No, goodbye Mr. Chip. - No, Chipfield sir. - Come along you two, we shall be late. - I’ve told you darling, We're going to have a look at some houses. - Aye, with Mr. Chipfield. - How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child. - King Lear. - Oh bravo sir, very well done. - Juliet? - Yes, darling. - Won't you come too sir, please, please? Room for a small one in front. - Very well. You may not be willing to give up anything for your father, but your father is perfectly willing to sacrifice his weekly game of golf in order that you should not be saddled with some suburban Shangri-La at an inflated price. Drive on. - [Roderick] Yes sir, right away. (birds singing) - You have now spent 65 minutes searching for Rose Cottage, A bijou gem set in a ledge floral surrounding. Do you think there is any point in our going on any further? - Oh it certainly is, Sir Beverley. I haven't seen the property myself, yet. I've got a feeling it's gonna be just what they want. I'm sorry about this delay, Mr. Munro. - Oh that's all right, if it's hard for you to find, It will be hard for others too. - No doubt we’ll be able to persuade the council Do something about this road, sir. Rumor has it they're building a motorway down here that will greatly increase the value of the property. - That sort of rumor Mr. Chesapeake, Is only believed by the gullible or the half witted. - I believe it, sir. - Exactly. Is that it? (inspirational music) - There we are sir, there. - Oh, it's not bad darling. - Not bad at all. - Obviously, falling to pieces. Reminds me of a cottage in Long Live the King, A play I was in once. - That was the one where Bonnie Prince Charlie Was hiding in the apple tree, wasn't it? - You're entirely wrong, I presume you refer To Charles I I who hid in an oak tree. - Anyway, you're terribly good playing royalty. Do you play polo as well? - Oh Dexter, a wishing well, isn't that romantic? - I suppose it is. - Nice unique feature actually, undoubtedly Elizabethan. It's got the date on it here somewhere. - 1 666, it's a perfectly ordinary well, The kind a pussy falls into. It suggests there is no main water supply. - Well water is so much healthier, you know. It's delicious for the old Scotch, delicious. (gagging) I think pussy's been here already. - [Dexter] Oh, it's locked. - Come along darling. - Seems very solidly built. Something tells me this is just what we need. (Loud crashing) - Just as I thought, the whole place is falling to pieces. - That's nothing to worry about. - A couple of screws will soon put that right. - Course they will. - And after all, we can do it ourselves. - We'll do everything ourselves. Oh no, just a minute dear. If you don't mind, I'd like to carry you over the threshold. - Oh Dexter, what a darling idea, isn't it Daddy? - Absolutely darling. (Loud crashing) (yelling) - Now you'll be able to lay a new floor For yourselves, won't you? - There we are, after you sir. This way sir, mind your head. - It's a bit small, isn't it. - Much easier to warm up. Now if you want a larger room, You can knock down this dividing wall here. - What a good idea. - If you knock down that wall, You’ll knock down the entire house. - Now Daddy don't be such an old pessimist. Dexter and I are going to have a look around on our own. You stay here and talk to Mr. Chipfield. Come on darling. - Now sir I'm very, sir I'm very glad To have the opportunity of this little chat with you. You see I'm, I'm anxious to turn professional. - Really with Tottenham Hotspur? - Oh sir, you are quick. - No, not Tottenham Hotspur sir, Harry Hotspur, once more into the breach dear friends, And all that old Vic stuff. - Mr. Chipperfield, I fail to see why I should deprive the property business of a bad actor In order to supply the stage with a bad estate agent. - It's not much of a kitchen darling. - No, we’ll just have to start from scratch. But try and imagine what it would look like. A refrigerator there, a sink unit there, a stove there, And a small cupboard over in the corner there. You see what I’ve got in mind? - Yes, I think I can. Refrigerator, sink unit, stove, and cupboards. Yes, I know exactly what you mean. But wouldn't it be a bit expensive? - No, not if we're careful. - Well, Daddy will take care of it. - Juliet. I'm not gonna take a penny. - All right darling, not a penny. We’ll have a chandelier up there, Only a small one of course. - Might that not be a wee bit ostentatious? Careful with those floor boards. - Oh Dexter, isn't it a darling? We’ll have a four poster here, a big one. And we’ll have cupboards all along that wall for my dresses. And we’ll have another one her for my shoes. - That will be marvelous. Where am I gonna keep my clothes? - In the spare room, I suppose. Who are those people? - [Dexter] They've obviously come to look over the house. - We're not to let them. Tell Mr. Chipfield to send them away. - Right. (yelling in pain) Loose floor board. - What's happened here? - Somebody's in our garden. Mr. Chipfield tell them to go away. - Sorry Mrs. Munro, that's Mr. And Mrs. Trumper. They're clients of ours too. - Well tell them it's sold. - Can't do that I'm afraid, it's up for auction. You'll excuse me won't you sir? - What are we gonna do? - We'll put them off it, of course. Daddy you must help us, Even if it's only to annoy Mr. Chipfield. Oh please darling, you're such a fabulous liar. - Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Trumper. - How do you do? - Good afternoon. - So glad you were able to have A second view of this delightful property. Yes, opposition, they're crazy about this place too. - Quite the pokiest cottage I've ever been in, Riddled with dry rot, and the drains reeking of black fever. - And it's a pity about the delinquent school next door. (wood cracking) - Oh, Dexter, oh, oh dear. - I fell. - Wasn't very clever. - Well, well, well. - Come along Cedric, he's just showing off. - Excuse me. - Of course. (yelling) (water splashes) - Really? - The idea. - [Juliet] Dexter, are you asleep? - [Dexter] Yeah. - Do you think those ghastly people will buy our cottage? - They might. - Couldn't we definitely decide to buy it ourselves? - It's an awfully big decision to make. We better sleep on it. - I do love it so. Shan't sleep a wink worrying about it. (calm music) (grand music) (humming) ♪ Good morning my daughter ♪ Come on Dexter, rise and shine. - That settles it. We're gonna buy Rose Cottage or bust. (fast paced music) - Yes well, from what you're say Mr. Munro it appears you'll not only have a delightful property In Rose Cottage, also a fairly sound investment. - Oh I knew that's what my best friend would say. - I take it you propose to put up a Small percentage of the purchase price. - Exactly, yes. - Yes while we, excuse me, while well we advance the remainder using the house and your Life insurance policy as security. - Leaving me with ample reserves for improvements. You know, carpets, curtains, etcetera. - It remains to be seen whether your bid - Lt remains to be seen whether your bid Of 4000 pounds is successful at Friday's auction. - Well I'll not bid a penny more. - That's the sort of talk we like To hear in the County Bank. - Thanks. - Apple Cottage. - Rose Cottage, sir. - Of course.

And so Lana baby, will you. - Oh Roddy. - L'm going to do what no estate agent has ever done before. See if I could be of assistance After the house has been sold. (upbeat music) - [Dexter] What's this? - [Juliet] Daddy must have sent them. Don't be angry darling, he's only trying to help. - Bulstrodes of Belgravia. By appointment to the nobility. That means another 50% on the bill. - Don't worry darling. He's probably only giving an estimate. - Well these tiles will most certainly have to be relayed. And at the same time I suggest we repaint The chimney stacks and check the gutters. All right sir? - Yes, windows will have to be Repainted and the sashes checked. - What's going on? - This is my daughter and son-in-law who are going to I’ve here. - Morning sir. Shall we continue with the interior? - [Sir Beverley] Very well. - You see my whole aim is to do away with This ghastly oldy worldy, tea shoppy, country cottage motif. And that'll have to go. - Yes. - And I suggest we eliminate this wall leading to the hall, with perhaps a picture window here with A terrazzo leading through to the lawn. - I'm quite content to leave The artistic details to you, agreed Juliet? - I think that's a lovely idea. - I thought we were gonna do everything ourselves? - If this cottage is even to be remotely tolerable - If this cottage is even to be remotely tolerable It’ll have to be done up by experts. - Yeah, but wait a minute. I'm not a millionaire you know. - You were saying Mr. Bolingbroke? - I thought the color motifs would be yellow and apricot. They're the colours of the season you know. - And green. - Yes, in moderation. - I don't want to interfere, but... - What is it Dexter? - Well this happens to be my cottage and I'll decorate it As I want it without interference from anyone. Now get out, the lot of you. - A nice show of gratitude, I must say. - It is Dexter's cottage darling. - There was a time when my efforts To provide you with comfort was appreciated. - But Dexter wants to do it his way. - Very well. - L'm sorry darling. - That's all right. But Daddy's so sensitive. - Oh I know. - Do you really think we’ll be able to do it all ourselves? - Aye, and for what we can't do we can find a country Workman whose prices will be more within our means. - Hello, hello there sir. Looking round the old love nest? Remember me? - No audition. - Oh sir, before you make such An unwise decision do look at these. You'll see me in an entirely new light sir. - Young man I have no wish to view your snapshots. - But I'm the man with a million faces, sir. - L'm satisfied at least you have more than one. - Oh sir, look. - Good Heavens. - Surprises you, aye sir? I'm a master of the old disguise. - Disguise, that is major surgery. - [Roderick] Sir, that's supposed to be there at all. - Don't apologise, I admire your versatility. - What, oh but this isn't me sir.

I mean you don't want to rush into Any needless expense now do you? - Well, we'd like an estimate as soon as possible. - Ah yes, well I'm afraid you’ll have to wait a day or two for that because you see, Mrs. Wick, you see, she's the accountant. And she's got a, well she's poorly. - But it isn't gonna cost all that much, is it? - Oh no no, very little, very little indeed, considering. - Considering. - Well, how long before we can move in? - Oh, let's find out.

(Laughing) - How's it going, any trouble? - Oh no just a few toes missing, And a bit loose guttering, nothing to worry about. - About a half a day's work, in fact. - Oh if that, if that Mr. Munro, hey Ron? - Yeah, that's about the size of it. - Good, good. - Is everything all right? - Oh perfect. The way things are gone we should be in in 1 0 days. Well, a fortnight anyway. (Loud banging) - I was under the impression that My assistance was no longer required. - Oh don't be silly. I told you Dexter didn't mean that. - You told me my dear, your husband did not. - Well he will now, won't you darling? Won't you darling? - Well naturally I didn't mean to be rude. It was just that I was getting so worried about the expense. I'm sorry. - I accept your apology unreservedly. And I think the curtain material quite delightful And inexpensive at two pounds a yard. - This looks like Mr. Wicks' estimate. Might as well start off with the bad news first thing. Gee whiz. - Anything wrong, Dexter? - 033 pounds, 11 and five pence. - That, I dare say, is only a beginning. - He says the whole roof will have to be redone. - L'm sure he does. That's how these small time builders exist. - Listen to this. For plumbing, 305 pounds. - Ridiculous, you'll have to go and see him straightaway. - I can't, I've already had one day off this week. - Well somebody's got to go.

The modern sanitary engineer doesn't Forget nothing, and neither does his mate. - Indeed. - Hey Josh. - You'll be suggesting next that young Ron here Has come to say that he's forgotten our dinner. - How did you know? (upbeat music) - [Josh] I warn you sir, it ain't safe up here, is it Ron? - No, it's falling to bits, look at this. - There's no need to make it worse than it already is. This part's perfectly sound anyhow. - Oh, but that's one of the good ones. Look at it, it's disgusting, disgust I'll tell you. - Wait till see the chimney stack, it's cracked right in the middle. Let's show him Ron, come on. - There it is. - What's the matter, nervous? - Certainly not. - Well you aught to be, 'cause bit here Is condemned, as per page three, item 1 7. - On the contrary. This section of the roof is perfectly sound. I aught to know, I've played... (Loud crashing) - Are you all right down there, sir? Perfectly, one thing my profession Has taught me is how to fall. - [Josh] Well mind where you put your feet. We do want you going through the ceiling now do we? I'll have young Ron, bring a ladder to you. Come on Ron. The revised estimate for roof, Two dozen more slates, new joists and underpinning. Say 23, 1 0? (Loud crashing) Plus new bedroom ceiling, say 42 pound. They never learn. -? 3 pounds, 1 0. 4? quid. (upbeat music) Can you spare me a moment, Mr. Wedgewood? Well, the fact is that I've been working pretty hard lately and it's two years now since I last asked you for a, what with my new house and the unforeseen expenses, Well I expect you can guess what I'm about to say. I wouldn't have brought the matter up only, course if business hasn't been too good lately and you, You don't feel that this is the right time? Well, thanks anyway forgiving my suggestion your Kind consideration.

(clay breaking) - Hello, hello. Everything all right Mr. Munro? - Oh fine, fine. Apart from paying too much for the house, I have to take two weeks unpaid holiday, and the builders estimate goes up on An average of 50 pounds a day. - Jolly good. - What do you want, anyway? - I was hoping to snatch a word With your delightful father-in-law. He's anxious to browse through my scrapbook. Would you care to? - Sir Beverley's not here now and l'm busy. - Well, is there any chance of him turning up later then? - Unfortunately yes. - Well in that case I'll wait if you don't mind. - As you wish, but keep away from that wall. - Oh why? - L'm about to knock it down. - No no, pickaxe. No no, pickaxe. (glass breaking) - [Josh] Oye, watch it! - Allow me. Pickaxe. It's stuck. - Aye, I can see that. (grunting) I'll have to knock it out from the other side. When I shout right, I'll bash and you pull, right? - Right. - Right? - Right. (Loud banging) - Right? - Call this a bath? It's too narrow, it's too shallow, the plug hole is inaccessible, And the taps are in the wrong position. It's nothing more than an exaggerated bidet. - It's the standard model for the bijou residence sir. Most of our customers prefer the taps in that position. - I prefer to turn on my bath With my hands, not with my feet. The taps should be here in the middle. - But Daddy, that sort's far too expensive. - Don't let spoil the tub for the hate of the tap. I want to enjoy my bath when I come to stay with you. Let's see if you can't find something better somewhere. Now, what about that one over there? - Oh no. (calm music) - This is our deluxe suite sir. As you can see it has the single type faucet, Tastefully disguised in the shape of a dolphin. And, as you require, set into The wall in the central position. - How much? - 300 guinea sir, delivery in one week. - Daddy, we can't possibly let you do it. - Is there a lavatory included? - Yes sir. - Where is it? Oh, I beg your pardon. - Would you care to try the bath for size, sir? - Naturally. That's better, have a good splash in this. All these gadgets work? (yelling) Don't me mad, you idiot! Why on Earth didn't you tell me This water was turned on, you imbecile? - Wrong towel sir. - If I carry on like this I'll be - If I carry on like this I'll be Too tired to give Sir Beverley an audition. - There's only this wee bit left. - Can you spare a minute, Mr. Munro? - What is it? - Well, what we always say in the building trade is There's always surprises around the corner. Some's good and some's bad. You have to take the rough with the smooth. Well, to cut a long story short, as you might say. It's the roof, wood rot. The whole lot will have to come down. - How much? - Without, as you might say, committing myself, 300 pound, give or take 50 or so. - Why didn't someone tell me this before? - Always have trouble with these cottage conversions. I don't know why people ever buy them. What I mean is, the surveyor should have noticed. You did have a surveyor, didn't you? - There wasn't time. - Wasn't time? He never knew. Well, back to work, time's money. - Blessing in disguise really. All these improvements you're making Will greatly increase the value of the property. Not only that, I'm saving you a great deal of money By helping you knock down this wall. (wood creaking) - Here, what's going on then? (Loud rumbling) (upbeat music) - [Lang] ls this it? - [Sir Beverley] Yes. - [Lang] What's it being used for, target practice? - Oh Lang. - You've got about as much chance of moving in here this month as I have of dancing The pasodoble with Dame Margot Fonteyn. - Daddy don't be like that. You wait until we get inside, Dexter's working wonders. - Oaf! - L'm terribly sorry. - Don't worry, he was always was a sucker for slapstick. Oh, nice big room. - Yes, it'll look even bigger when the ceiling's finished. - The proper way to whitewash your ceiling is for the brush never to leave the surface except when dipped in the pot. - Yeah yeah. - And you missed that bit over there. - I haven't got to that bit yet. - What kind of wallpaper are you going to have? - We're not having wallpaper, we're distempering. - False economy, distemper flakes, you must have paper. - Here we go again. - You keep out of this. - How about a nice floral design? - Can't think of anything quite so disgusting. What this room needs is something perfectly simple. I will endeavor to find it. - We're not having wallpaper. - Bath's arrived. - [Juliet] I do hope you like it. - Oh, I'm sure I will, I'll go and get Mr. Wicks. Oh, would you mind? - Not at all. - Daddy. (grunting) - Hello hello sir, having a bath? I was just passing, so I thought I'd just... - Chipster I neither know nor care what you want. You've chosen the most inappropriate moment to call. - You said you'd be good enough to have a look... - Now now, thank you. I'm supervising what's certain to be a most delicate operation. - Well, I'm glad to give you a hand Sir Beverley. Whilst I'm doing that, perhaps I can tell you about... - Careful there, careful. - Directed by Roger Chipfield, who will also be appearing in the role of... - [Sir Beverley] Steady there. - Sir Walter Raleigh.

It'll be very colorful and I shall Personally supervise the whole, hey. - Must you always draw attention yourself Mr. Chipmunk? - I don't blame you being down there sir, please. Times money you know. Come on up with it lads, pitch it up. - Put all that rubbish down and lend a proper hand. - Right away sir. Wait a minute, my finger's caught, my finger's caught in the hole. - Remove it. (grunting) - Mind the paintwork (all talking at once) - Take the crate off it. - We'll have to get the casing off, come on. (all talking at once) You aught to ordered a shower you know. - Now get it erect. (all talking at once) - Watch the paintwork (gong banging) - Watch what you're doing you half witted nincompoops. - Oh wait, it's my father-in-law. I'm sorry. The best thing is to get this round in the door, And then we can get it over the bannister. Watch the woodwork. - Stop sucking your finger and go and give them a hand. - Tip it over this side, now come 'round to it. - Lend a hand Mr. Chipfield, come on. - I'll give you a hand, I've got it here. (all talking at once) - Mr. Chipfield, you're in the way. - You'll have to get over the other side, just get over to this side. - I don't know whether I can, I'll try. I can't get my foot out down here. I'll hold on up here. (wood breaking) (yelling) - Mr. Chipfield, are you all right? - Don't come in, l'm in the bath. - Oh dear. - He always has a bath Fridays. - Well, what do we do now then? - Take it outside and start again. - Come on boys, get it in.

Hold her there, hold it. - [Josh] This will clean up a treat, smashing. - It looks lovely Daddy, absolutely divine. - Certainly does, well worth all the trouble. Don't you think so, Dexter? - [Ron] There she is, now hold her there. Oh oh, no no, wait a minute.

You are heading for misery Mr. Munro. - You see there have been one or two Unexpected expenses in connection with Rose Cottage. - That sir, is putting it mildly. - The trouble is I can't get the workmen out. - What they haven't finished yet? Well there's only one way to get them out. You must move in immediately. - But the central heating isn't finished yet. - Central heating? Even Mrs. Gallagher and I haven't central heating. So far as this bank is concerned, this extravagant And reckless spending spree must cease forthwith. In no circumstances whatsoever are we prepared To advance you any more money. - I must have a hundred or two. - Then I suggest you borrow it from your father-in-law. - I’d rather shoot myself. - And don't expect the bank to pay for your funeral. Good day sir. (upbeat music) - Poor daddy, he's going to be so lonely. - Well, he's got Lang. Not bad, aye? - It's lovely. - Just a minute. I'll carry you over the threshold properly this time. Upsie Daisie. (Laughing) - Oh look, it's from Mr. Wicks. Don't use front door, use back. - It's not. (Laughing) (calm music) - This is all I've ever wanted. - Me too. Mind you I'll I feel happier When I've got curtains in this window. - I don't know why you worry about it. Nobody can see us. - All the same, I think I'll put up this blanket. Oh, damn. - Don't worry darling, moonlight's very romantic. Do you love me? (romantic music) (knocking on door) - What was that? Oh no. - Where is everyone? - In bed. - Well, it's only 1 0 o'clock, open up. - What does he want? - That's what I’d like to know. - An old man brokered with the storms of state Has come to lay his weary bones among ye. Couldn't let you face it alone. - But we were just getting into bed. - [Sir Beverley] Be careful of that, We must christen the house in an appropriate manner. - I suppose you'd better come in. - Do you mind if I have the room facing south? - But that's our room. - Otherwise I shall keep you awake all night with my asthma.

The modern sanitary engineer Is like the proverbial elephant. - And just as slow. - Wally, where's Wally? - Hey, we must have forgot him. - Which of you is the senior electrician? - I have that honor. - [Sir Beverley] Take me to your circuit box. - It ain't ready, sir. - Do as you're told. - As you say sir. - What are you, a fugitive from Jukebox Jury? - No you see, I'm on the roofing.

I've got lots of other things to do. (upbeat music) - Come on man. - Thanks. - Whoops, nearly right it in Sir Beverley. Very comical but a bit sticky around the old buttocks. I say, you know Mr. Munro you're turning this place Into a regular little Shangri, proper little paradise. - What do you want, and why are you wearing That ridiculous apology for a beard? - Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Sir Beverley. (scoffs) Besides, l'm playing Sir Walter Raleigh In the pageant, remember? That's why I came in actually sir. A couple of tickets for the VIPs enclosure. You won't be wasting your time, Sir Beverley.

Can you spare me a minute? - L'm coming too, it's my fuse box. (comical music) (drum roll playing) (comical music) - [Sir Beverley] What's going on? (comical music) (contemplative music) - I think I can guess why you want to see me Mr. Wedgewood. You may have been feeling lately that I haven't quite been pulling my weight. The fact is I've had so many financial worries I can't think of anything else. I realise that my work may have suffered a wee bit And that I have been late five times in the last two weeks. But, you weren't thinking of firing me were you? And you'd like me to leave at the end of the month? At the end of the week? Thank you. (calm music) - Don't worry darling, you can get another job. You could even start your own travel agency. - What with, my overdraft? - Where do you want this, Miss? - Oh just put it down there. And be careful with it, it's a valuable antique. - All right Miss. - Hello Lang. - Ah, hello Mrs. Munro. Is he ready yet? - Well, no not quite. - You have told him, haven't you? - We thought we'd better leave it until the last minute. - We better do it now, otherwise he'll never move out. Where is he? - Do you realise that idiot Wicks persisted in fitting 1 5 amp fuses, directly contrary to my instructions? I told him to fit 30 amps. - Daddy, Dexter has something to say to you. - Certainly my boy, what is it? - Yes, I wanted to ask you if... - Don't worry about me, I'm perfectly comfortable. Lang, what are you doing here? - Come to take you home. They're fed up with you interfering in everything. - Is this so? - Course not darling, it's just that Dexter and I Feel you'll be better off in your own house. - We've enough trouble as it is. I mean we should start off married life on our own. - I see. So your father isn't wanted. Lang, be so kind as to fetch my bags. - I mean it's a perfectly normal Thing for a young married couple. - Perfectly normal. I stay too long by thee, I weary thee. Thus thou so hunger at my empty chair that thou would needs Invest with mine honors before thy hour be right? Oh foolish youths. - Henry four, part two, act four, scene five, terrible. - When you're ready, Lang. - I feel awful turning him out like this. - Oh now don't you fall for his hearts of lance routine. - [Juliet] What's the matter Daddy? - Nothing, I'll be all right in a minute. - Don't worry. He always does that when he can't get his own way. It's only wind. I really am going to fire that man. - You're feeling better already, aye? - Goodbye my dear. I trust I’ve left nothing behind that reminds you of me. - Do you think he’ll be all right? - Of course he will, selfish old fool. I say good riddance. - That's not a very nice thing to say after all he's done for us. - Done for us? He stuck his nose in every time, he doubled our building costs, And given me so much worry I've lost my job. - That's nice thing to say about my father. You've made mistakes too. - Aye, and the biggest was to get him for a father-in-law. - So it was a mistake to marry me, was it? - I didn't say that, it's only your father I can't stand. - Then it's a pity you let him house you, Feed you, and entertain you, all free. - Oh he did it to please himself. He's a miserable, sanctimonious, cantankerous old buzzard. - Do you really think that? - Yes I do. - Then this is what I think of you, (slap lands) I hate you! - Where do you think you're going? - Back home, where I belong. - Juliet come back, I didn't mean anything.
