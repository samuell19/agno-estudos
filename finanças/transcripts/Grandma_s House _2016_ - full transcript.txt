Your boy in the house. [laughs] I see you, Reverend, look like you got Jesus Instagram. [laughs] What up boy? - [Kimberly] This is my mother's wedding day. Well, at least the day she's celebrating her wedding. - I see you skinny slacks. Boy then, what up boy? Yes sir. Hold up. Got the back to Africa button down, I see you. [sings in foreign language] [laughs] Purple rain. I see you, girl. Gonna need some of that. [laughs] Oh really, so it's snowing up in here now, huh? [laughs] Can I get some flowers, can I get some flowers? Okay, I see you. Tell your mamma I said what's up. Okay, it's going down. Smell like wings up in here. Really? Oh, they can't be serious, they cannot be serious. Ain't no water in the pool. - [Kimberly] It's the happiest day I can remember. My mother, and her long time boyfriend, Edgar Allen Jackson. - I see you boy, that boy looking like the first day of school clean. - What's up Earl? - I see you did it. - Yeah, yeah I did. - Now you know we thought you was never gonna do it, right? - Yeah well, I did. - But I'm saying, we thought you was never gonna do it. I mean y'all done had babies, Brandon's 13. Jacob's 11 now, right? - Yeah. - [Kimberly] He finally did it, he married her. No one in the family ever thought he would marry her. My grandmother said, "Why buy the cow, "when the milk is free?" My mother said, "Men these days aren't buying cows anyway." [laughs] - Cynthia? - [Kimberly] Uncle Earl is my mother's older brother. Back when he was doing whatever it was he was doing, he would always give her money. Now that he's broke he expects her to help him out, he lives with my grandmother. A walking cliche. - Hey come on, I'm here, ain't I? - Yes you are. - Let me hold a little something. - Earl, I am celebrating my wedding today. - I'm here, ain't I? - I can't. - Oh, so it's like that now, Cynthia? Wasn't like that when you wanted that Hello Kitty back in the day, now was it? Hot wings! [breathe heavily] - Why'd your parents bother to get married anyway? - 'Cause you're supposed to get married. - Yeah, you're supposed to get married. - Says who? - You just are. - Says who? - Says Jesus, that's who. Brandon and Jacob are my little brothers. Edgar's sons. My dad... Well, that's another story for another day. Sometimes kids can be so cruel. But they also see the world in simple black and white, that's how my grandmother sees it. She's not here, she's never around when there's smoking, drinking, and cussing, she don't play that. She says it grates on her spirit. She never approved of Edgar and my mom's living arrangements, which is why we're not that close anymore. But she was always there when my mother needed her. Today Grandma Margie is at a revival. - Dullest place I've ever been. [upbeat jazz music] - Mamma. - Hi baby. - You look so pretty. - Oh girl, thank you baby. - Are you having a good time? - I am, I am, I'm just ready for all these people to get out of my house. - [Kimberly] I'm so proud of my mother, she's getting herself on track, after a few rough years. She's got a good job, she's making good decisions, minus Edgar, of course. This was the last time I remember us truly happy. On that day we felt like a family. [upbeat jazz music] - Yes. Same address. Okay, thank you. - Stop. Oh my god. Don't play with me. Oh my god. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey! What's going on? - Come on baby, they were just playing. - Where's dinner at? - I just ordered some pizza. - What am I gonna do with some pizza? - What, I'm just getting home from work myself, honey. - Okay, you couldn't have put something in a crock pot this morning? - What, you couldn't put nothing in the crock pot this morning? - [Edgar] Never mind, don't matter. - [Cynthia] It does matter. - [Edgar] No it doesn't. - It does, say it. Kimberly take the boys upstairs, until the pizza gets here. - Yes ma'am. - Okay Edgar look, I work just like you do. Now we supposed to be equal partners in this. - Yeah partners got responsibilities to each other. Where they at? - What I can't get a night off? - A night off, you barely got a night on. You do what you feel like doing around here. - That is not true. - It's absolutely true. - [Kimberly] Edgar wasn't always this way. He's different when he's drinking, but then again, so is my mom. They've been on and off again for like 14 years. Now that they're finally married I don't know if they're better now or worse. - Say it. I see you wanna say it, say it, I dare you to say it. - I'm just tired of us arguing. Okay, can we just try and talk, without yelling, and screaming? Can we just do that, please? - Look, look, there's nothing to talk about, okay? I know exactly where I can go get a hot meal. I'll see you. - Edgar wait, please, honey. - [Cynthia] Come on, can't we just talk about it? Edgar! [somber instrumental music] - I know, right? Are you sure you love me? [laughs] Hey, let me call you back, I'm gonna check on my mom real quick. Mamma. Mamma. Mamma? - Hey baby. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. I'm fine, baby. You just worry too much. - You don't seem fine. [sighs] You're drinking again. Grandma says "When it hops like a rabbit, "and eats carrots, don't let a fool "convince you it's a fish." - So what you calling me a fool? - No. I'm just saying I'm not a little girl anymore. You can be honest with me, I know you're not happy, mom. Why don't you just leave, it doesn't have to be like this. [shushes] - Baby, why don't you clean up all of this mess, 'cause I don't want your brothers to see it when they get up, okay? - Okay. [somber instrumental music] - Brandon, Jacob, come on now. Well, look at you. And Brandon. Okay now, don't you look handsome? - Why do we have to dress up, nobody dresses up for church anymore. - Well we do. That's how I was raised, and that's how I am raising you. It's the way we honor God, by showing him an effort to look respectable. I would not just show up to my office in jeans. Alright, and your grandmother always said, what? That God deserves our best effort. Come on, lets go. - Is daddy coming? - You know what, why don't you guys just go and wait in the car, okay? I'll be right out. Hey. You coming to church? - Nope. - It'd really mean a lot to me if you came, Edgar. I don't like the way things are between us right now, honey. - I got fired Friday. - What? - Don't. All I wanna do is sit here, and watch the game.

I know that mother Margie, and your mom has been doing an excellent job raising you. - Well I'm hoping she'll join the young missionaries in the fall, after school starts. - I think that'd be wonderful. You know your grandmother tells me often, there's a calling on your life. - [Kimberly] Today wasn't so bad, it's like God knew we were gonna need all the help we could get for what was gonna happen next. [door slams] [ominous instrumental music] [distant arguing] - What's going on? - Guys, come here. - Kimberly, pack your things. - Why, mamma? - Just get your things, pack your things now. Come on! [ominous instrumental music] - Wait, what, what are you looking at? You looking like you're just gonna judge me, don't judge me, you know your mamma, she's the crazy one. You wanna look crazy, look at her. She's... But you know what, I'm not letting her leave though. Never, you know why? 'Cause she said I do, and I do is forever. You should learn that when you're older. There's no outs, there's no exits. And there's no outs! - Kimberly I need you to take your brothers, and you go down to the car, okay? - Hey, hey, back up, back up. Woah, woah... - [Cynthia] Move, Edgar. - Wait, wait, woah. You're not going nowhere, no you're not going nowhere. Where are you going? Hey, hey, hey. - Move, move, move, you're drunk. - You will not keep my children from me, come here. - Edgar, Move! [bottle shatters] [Edgar groans] [shouts] Oh God, go babies, go. Go babies, go. Go, go, go... [Cynthia screams] Go, get the keys, go! Go! Let go of me, now! Get off! Go, out! - Mom? - Not now, Kimberly. - Mamma... - [Cynthia] Kimberly, not... Stop, just be quiet. I love you, okay. Kimberly, I'm gonna have to go away for a little while, okay? - What, what? - I need you to look after your brothers. - [Kimberly] What, where are you going, mom? - What are you doing here? - I just need you to stay here with your grandmother, okay? It's just for a little while, baby. Alright? Just so Edgar can have some time to get himself together... - Edgar? - You're going back to him? - Y'all wait over there for me. - [Kimberly] You're going back to him mom? - Don't, don't... [groans] Baby, just go inside. Please Kimberly, just go, just go. See you baby. - [Kimberly] What are you... - Just go. Go! - Go on in. Cynthia! Cynthia! Cynthia! Cynthia, you hear me. [sighs] Oh God. - Hey. Everything okay? - Oh child, we can talk about that in the morning, right now I gotta get these kids settled. Okay, Kimberly you and Maryland can share a room. And Brandon, and Jacob, you can share Izak's room. - Can't they all share Izak's room, or they can sleep on the couch, or on the floor? - I just told them where they're gonna sleep. Roll your eyes at me again, and I will snatch 'em out their sockets. Chloe take these boys up to Izak's room. Your room is two doors on the right. Cynthia just dropped all them kids off at the door. - Lets get you some tea. [sighs] - Lord. [somber instrumental music] [knock on door] Kimberly, you hungry baby? - No, no thanks. [sighs] - This used to be your mother's room, you know. I'd come in here and pray with her, every night before she went to sleep. Oh, she was a scary little thing. Always seeing something in the shadows. But not you. You're stronger than even you know. Baby this too is gonna pass. It's gonna pass. - Grandma? - Yes, baby? - Nothing... Never mind. - Alright then, I'm going to bed. Goodnight. - [Kimberly] Goodnight.

It's just we're already living on top of each other around here. - Believe me, I don't want to be here any longer than I have to. Chloe's getting big though. - Your mom looks like she's been drinking again. - What? - Well I saw her outside, and she looked a hot mess. - That's none of your business. Who do... - Well if you ask me, it's completely dysfunctional. - Okay, but nobody asked you. And it's no more dysfunctional than you having a kid, at 14, after three abortions. - Oh yeah, well at least I know who I am. - Okay, when are you gonna realize that your mother is an alcoholic? Right. [screams] - Don't talk about my mom! - Get off of me! Get off of me! - Hey, hey, hey wait.

Now you listen, I know you're upset. But you take a minute, alright, get yourself together. Go on and go to bed. Everything is gonna be better in the morning. - Don't let Maryland get under your skin. People that are mad at the world, they're just looking for somebody to take it out on. Okay, hey. Okay?

Where's my grandma? - Where she is every morning. Down at the church, feeding the homeless. - Do you ever go? - Ew, of course not. - What are you doing? - Training. I'm Izak. - Kimberly. - Nice to meet you, you mind? - Sure. - Thanks. - Oh, sorry I didn't say hey to you when I saw you at church. - Oh that's okay. - How are you related to my grandmother? - Oh I'm not, I'm not. She used to work with my mom when she was a nurse. Yeah, she died last year, cancer. Mama Margie said I could stay with her, and finish high school. If it wasn't for her, I never would've graduated. - Well what are you training for? - College, I mean, that's the hope. If not that, well then the arena league. Yeah, I've been playing my whole life. Was all-state too, before I got in some trouble. - What kind of trouble? - You know, I was just hanging out with some guys from the neighborhood. You know, you ask a lot of questions. - I guess I'm the curious type. - I got a question. When you out here running in the streets with these little dudes, is y'all like pretending to be gangsters, or is y'all like really gangsters? - [Izak] I don't know what you mean, Uncle Earl. - Nah, I'm saying, it's like nowadays y'all harder online, than in real life. You know, I call 'em Twitter gangsters. [laughs] Facebook heathens. I mean they even banging on Instagram now. Hashtag, you gonna die. Double gun emoji, send. You know what I'm saying, like back in my day we really ran these streets. It's like y'all run the Halo world. It's like y'all thugging in Minecraft. - Uncle Earl, what are you talking about? - I just don't understand. Keep your head up, homie. - What? Why are you looking at me like that? - I'm curious too. - Breakfast is ready, and you can come in here and bust these suds. - What is her problem? - Which one? I'll see you inside. - Okay. Uncle Earl, are you eating? - Real men don't eat breakfast. [sighs] [dog barks] - Cynthia! [somber instrumental music] Cynthia? Cynthia? Cynthia! Lord have mercy. Cynthia! Baby? What are you doing? I went to your job, I've been calling over here all day. Cynthia... Alright, you better stop this mess. - Just leave me alone. - Child, you have gotta shake yourself loose from this thing. - I can't, mamma. - Yes, you can. Now God is not gonna let you fail if you don't let you fail. You stop this. You think about your children. - The neighbors called Child Protective Services. They're trying to take my children away from me, mamma. Mamma, don't let them take my kids away. I just need a little bit more time, that's all. I just need a little bit more time. - Come here baby.

Well, how did it go down at the store, the interview? - Mamma ain't nobody hiring a felon. - Now who are you to say what God will or won't do? - I'm the unemployed, broke one. - It's gonna get better. [laughs] - Remember what you used to say? "It gets better when you make it better." - Have you seen my mom? - Yeah baby, I saw her. - Can I see her? - Earl!

[laughs] [gentle piano music] [Margie hums] Chicken smelling good. You know taking care of a family starts with taking care of their bellies. Some day you gonna have your own husband, and if he's a real man, he's gonna expect a good meal. - Okay, grandma. Not everybody stays home and cooks. - Who said anything about staying home? A virtuous woman can do it all, 'cause God has given her the strength to get it done. You just have to tap into it. - And what if my husband wants to do the cooking? - He can cook, but that's not his job, his job is to provide, protect, and lead his family. - And if he doesn't do his job? - Well, that means you picked the wrong man. [laughs] And when you get the wrong one, it takes a whole heap of helping and praying to get him on the right track. - Well mamma said grandpa used to cook a lot when he was alive. - Your grandfather died when your mother was very young. But he was the hardest working man I knew. He knew how to cook about three meals. Barbecue, he made a mean fried chicken, and spaghetti. [laughs] - That must be what she remembers. Okay. - Alright, that's good, that's very good. We gonna fry that corn up, and then we're gonna mash potatoes, so I want you to skin all those potatoes. - Okay. - Okay, so get it, you gotta peel all those potatoes, and shuck all this corn. - Royce. Hey. - Hey, girl. - I miss you so much. - I know. - Things are so messed up. - You talk to your mom? - No, I haven't talked to her yet. - So your mom's a gangster, huh? - That is not funny. - Look I'm just playing with you, hey, you know I care about you, right? Come here. - Royce. - Come on girl, a man has needs. Look, when am I gonna spend some time with you, right, you've been playing. - I don't know... - Kimberly! - Yes, ma'am? - We don't entertain uninvited guests. - I invited him. - What's your name, son? - How you doing, I'm Royce Carter, nice... - Are you here trying to have sex with my granddaughter? - No, no, no, I'm not trying... We not trying to do nothing, I'm just... - Because her body is a temple, and she's saving it for Jesus. Now Royce if you ever come around here again, I want you to make sure that Kimberly has cleared it with me. - No, I just thought... - No, I'm not asking you to think, I'm asking you to make sure. Now, am I clear? - Yeah. - Good. Kimberly, say goodnight. Coming here all times of night, leaving the front door... - I'm so sorry. - Don't worry about it. - Can I call you later? - Yeah call me. - Jesus. - How many times I have to tell you don't take the Lord's name in vain? Look at you. You dressed like a prostitute, peddling tricks. What do you think's gonna happen? You got to have more respect for yourself. Roll 'em again. - But I didn't even... - Get dressed. Come on down and help me finish dinner. - [Maryland] I think I look good. - Are you okay? - Yes. No. I don't really know what okay is supposed to feel like right now. - Yeah, I know that feeling. You know the worst part is being on the edge of okay. I mean... It feels so close, but it's miles and miles away, you know? - I just really miss my mom. - I understand that. [ominous hip-hop music] Kimberly, you wanna go inside the house right now?

See they making millions. And you getting paid... - Nothing. - [Snoopy] Yep. [friends laugh] Bro, you know how we used to do. - Yeah man, I remember. Yeah, I'm just... I'm trying to find a different way, you know? - A different way? - There ain't no different way. - Everybody is looking for one thing. And you can take the easy way, or the hard way. - Look man, I'm just trying to do what's right. - There ain't no right thing, man. Everybody is taking from everybody else. Politicians, business men, it's a hustle on every level. - You either take or you get took, yo, simple as that. - This next score, it's gonna set us up for life.

Ow. Please, may I have some more chicken? - Yes, you may. - Hey! - You don't know how to say thank you? - Thank you. - Too late, but I bet you'll remember next time. - Sit down. - Why are you so mean? - The world is mean, I'm just trying to teach you. - I don't need you to teach me. I have a mom and a... Can I just go to my room now? - As soon as you finish what's on your plate. What? I knew that's what you were gonna say. - Don't be so mannish.

You need to go, seriously. - No. - I want you to come home with me, now. - Okay, all you children put the food away, and clean the kitchen, I'm gonna go up and take my pills. - What kind of pills? - They're her heart pills, but never mind that, who's at the door? Whoever it is, it looks like she doesn't wanna see him. - That's Uncle Thomas. - Her husband? - Let me make you believe in me again. - This not gonna... Let me tell you something. I am doing everything in my power not to hate your guts, that's what I'm doing. - Listen baby, listen... - Get off me! - Okay, okay, listen, listen, listen. I've been praying, I've been asking God to intervene. I'm just asking you to forgive me. No, I'm begging you, I'm begging you to just please forgive me. - Please forgive you? Come on, you destroyed our marriage over somebody... - No, no, no, no, listen, listen, Loretta, I promise, she didn't mean anything to me. - Oh she didn't? - Nothing. - She meant nothing to you? - Nothing. - You destroyed our entire marriage over someone that meant nothing to you? Are you jo... You need to go! You need to... - Listen! - You need to get off me. - Listen, just... - Go! - Get off of me. Stop it, Loretta. - Oh Mommy Margie, they're fighting! - [Loretta] What you need to do... - Loretta, somebody get her! - Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Go, get off of me! No! No, why, why? You need to move. You need to move. You need to move. - Loretta. - Why did you do that to us? - Y'all get in the house. Get in the house. - Why? Get off of me. Get off of me. - Come on, I'll be standing right here till you come home. - Stop! - Thomas I need to talk to you. - That was like some Real Housewife stuff. - Thank you. - [Kimberly] You're welcome. - Can you give me some privacy? - I'm just saying.

[dramatic instrumental music] [gunshot fires] - I'm sorry mamma that I brought this chaos to your home, and I'm gonna leave tonight. - Oh, you'll do no such thing. - I don't know what to do. I don't. I don't know. [sighs] - I had a dream once about a rock rolling down a hill. And in the middle of this hill there was so much trash. Beat up cars, just anything you could imagine. But when this rock rolled down anything that was in its way would just move to the side. Baby that rock was Jesus. - I don't understand. I don't know what to do. - Loretta, anything that is unclean, has got to get out of his way. Now you have to decide do you want to cling to the rock, or do you want to cling to the trash? - I think if my marriage isn't founded on the rock then it won't last. - That's right, Jesus is the rock. Come on baby. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - It's alright. It's alright. You clean yourself up. Go, clean yourself up. - Thank you. - Okay. ♪ Jesus is the rock - Oh, Lordie. [phone vibrates] Hello?

Can you help him? Oh God. Oh... [coughs] Oh Earl, hold on baby, just... [grunts] - Grandma? [grunts] Uncle Earl never made it to the hospital. The way my grandma handled my Uncle Earl's death and funeral was amazing. Her faith in God was so strong, it made me want to be like her.

Hold on, yes ma'am? - I know you not talking on that phone this late. - But it's my phone. - But this is my house. - I have to go, sorry, bye. - Young lady, you are going to have to have more dignity about yourself. That boy is not gonna respect you if you don't make him respect you. - But grandma, why can't I talk to him? That's my boyfriend. - I didn't say you couldn't talk to him. But talking to him this late. That ain't nothing but a recipe for sin, and disaster. That boy's hormones are already raging. And he looking at you like you a piece of meat. Secondly, you bout to go to college, you need to be focusing on them books. There is gonna be plenty of time for boys later. - No, but grandma, he really does care about me. - I can see the devil in that boy's eyes. He's gonna lie, maneuver, until he gets you to give it up. - Grandma, you do not know everything, like not everybody's out to get me. I need to be able to be me. - Oh, you don't know nothing about being me yet. But you will. You just keep living a little more. Now you go to bed. And give me that phone. [somber instrumental music] Lord. [sighs] Almighty God. Now you are the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end, and if you can't do it, it can't be done. I keep talking to 'em Lord, they don't hear me. I don't think they hear me, Lord. [sighs] - Oh God, you scared me. - What are you... [shushes] - Is she still out there praying? - Yes, but what does... - Okay, good. So I have about 10 more minutes before she goes to sleep, and then we can sneak out. - Sneak out and go where? - This party, a couple blocks over. - Jason's party? - Yeah, how do you know about it? - My boyfriend's trying to get me to come. - So then lets go. - No, are you... No, we'll get in trouble, no. - Look, Mama Margie prays, every night for 15 minutes before she goes to bed. She sleeps like the dead, she won't even know we're gone. - No, I mean, I don't know. No. - Oh come on. You know you wanna go. - I do wanna see him. - Okay then, good. Put on something sexy, and lets go. - Okay. [suspenseful instrumental music] - Go? - [Maryland] To the door yes, to the door. Go out the door. - I'm opening it. - Okay, shush. - Wait, I think I... I think I hear her. - [Maryland] Stop that. - I think I heard her. [sighs] - I don't hear anything. She's not coming. Pull it together, lets go. - God, you're such a... [door slams] [muffled whispers] [energetic hip hop music] [overlapping conversations] Do I hear Boom Boom? Look at this party. - Maryland, I am not feeling this. - Girl, what? This party is turnt up. - Hey, what's up baby, you made it huh, what's good? - Excuse me, so you're not gonna introduce me? - Maryland, this is my boyfriend, Royce. - What's up Maryland? - And it's spelled like the state, not the slut. - Hey look, lets go into the back room real quick. - Why do we need to go to the back? - Just get some privacy, just get out of here. - I can't leave Maryland like that. - Trust me, Maryland looks just fine. Come on, lets get out of here. - Okay, Maryland I'll be right back. - [Maryland] Okay. - You know that boy been sleeping in his car for the last two days. - I just don't know what he's trying to prove. - Well obviously he loves you. - If he loved me he wouldn't have cheated on me. - You carrying a whole lot of stones. - What does that mean? - Jesus said, "He who is without sin "cast the first stone." And since you're throwing stones, well I just assumed that you were without sin. - No, it's not that simple. It... I honestly don't know if I can forgive him. - Well maybe it's you that don't love him. - Maybe. I... I do. - The more forgiveness you need, the more love you have to have to give it. You know a lot of people think life is more complicated than it is. - How so? - Man is one of a few days, with much trouble. Life is about how you handle that trouble. How you handling your trouble, Loretta? - I just wanna be loved without an asterisk. - With a as, what? - Asterisk. You know, plain, simple. - Baby, you got to give the kind of love you want to get. - Thank you. [sighs] What are you doing? - Waiting for you. - Why? - Because I'm your husband. And I love you. - You don't love with words. - I know. - Your words are poisonous, creeping, manipulative. - I know. - [Loretta] Is that all you have to say? - I have lots to say. But you're right. My words mean nothing. I'm embarrassed, and unworthy, and what I'm asking of you. - What'd you say to the firm? - Just told 'em I had some family issues to deal with. - What about your cases? - They can wait. - Can't you just go home, and wait for me there? - No, I messed this up. And I gotta make this right, and sitting at home won't fix that. - I don't know how to get past this. - I don't either. I just know that I'm willing to do whatever it takes, whatever it takes to make it work. I'll be waiting right here, until you're ready for me to take you home. - Thomas. - Yeah? - I was thinking that maybe we should just go get you a room somewhere. - Not unless you're coming with me. I'm in this begging mood. You remember that's how I got you to marry me in the first place? - Oh Thomas. - Please baby, baby, please. ♪ Please baby baby ♪ Please - Here's the finger, here's the finger. ♪ Please [stammers] - Hold on. - I'm not gonna smile, I'm not. - Loretta, listen to me. I love you. I'm sorry. I'm here. [sighs] - Let me go talk to mamma. - Alright. ♪ Please baby baby please - Come sit down for a little bit. Babe, I've been thinking about you so much. - You have? - Yes, of course. Look, you know how much I care about you, right? - Do you now? - Yes.

You're trying to have sex with me. - Babe, what's wrong with that? - Boy, move. - Wait, wait, hold on. Why are you tripping? - Do you really wanna see what happens next? It's not gonna be what you're thinking. - It's alright. - Just got a text. Yo, my boy just told me got a little freak in the back, and they about to set it off. - That's what I'm talking about. - Man, I'm not with that, man. - Yo, lets go get in the train, man. - [Q] Yeah, come on dude. - [Kimberly] What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? - Where's Maryland? - Wait, Maryland's here? - Yeah.

I can handle it Mamma Margie. - Yeah this ain't none of your business. - Well I'm making it my business. And I would appreciate it if you would get off my property. - I'll leave. But he's coming with me. - Oh no he's not. He doesn't belong to you, he's a child of God, and you can't have him. - Old lady, I'm trying to be nice, but if you don't lift your little old behind back in that house... - Hey man, you better check yourself. - [Margie] Wait a minute. Or you gonna what baby? You don't have no power over me. And I command you, and these demons to get out of my yard, in the name of Jesus. - Demon, huh? Okay. Now I'm gonna act like one. - Are you sure that this is what you wanna do? - Shut-up! - You don't have to do this. - Baby, God's got better for you, he's got more for you. - Ain't no God. - Alright. Then you go ahead and you just pull that trigger, see what not believing in God is gonna get you while you rot away in jail. Go ahead, son. Go ahead! You can kill my body, but you can't touch our souls. - Yo man, I don't know if I'm down for killing no old lady, man. - Shut up! - I know where my soul is going, do you, huh? Do you know for sure? Come on child. Son. Make a decision. - More money for us. [sighs] Lets get out of here.

You've been so faithful, just rest. It's okay. Just rest. Just rest. It's okay for you to just rest. [somber instrumental music] [sobs] [coughs] [sobs] Grandma. My grandmother died that day. I don't know if my words brought her peace, but they did that for me. The same day I get my mother back, I lose my grandmother. My mother said she wanted me to speak at my grandmother's funeral, but I don't know what to say. I stand here today, touched by an angel. A woman whose light could not be dimmed by pain, tragedy, or despair. She was the cornerstone of her community, and her family, and she believed in living right, and helping people. She was one of the most giving souls I've ever met. That was my grandma. And even though I told her I love you, you're special, I never said it enough. I never showed it enough. The phrase, "Give me my flowers while "I can still smell them," rings in my mind. But in saying that, every grandma is someone special. Not only do they raise their children, but they pass down wisdom to their children's children. Looking out into the crowd gathered here, I see so many lives that my Grandmother Margie touched and blessed. [somber piano music] I miss you, grandma. [sobs] - Ah, look at you guys. So pretty. Pretty girl, guess what, you got your own room. Come on, let me show you. I hope you like pink. [somber piano music] - [Kimberly] The nights that are spent praying for us, interceding, giving the last of themselves, it is breathtaking. They do what only a grandmother can. Grandmothers today still wanna be cool, they wanna date. But I thank God for those grandmothers that have imparted such importance to us by giving of themselves, and looking for nothing in return. That was my grandmother. [sirens wail] [distant radio chatter] And yes, I'm sad to see her go, but I know she would want us to celebrate her life, and not mourn her death, for when this earthly vessel passes away, there's another building, not made by hand. - Can I help you? - [Scott] Izak, Izak Mitchell? - Yeah. - [Scott] Hey, I'm Coach Scott. I wanna talk to you about coming to play for the Badgers, son. - Come on in, come on in. - You sure, okay, alright. - Yeah, yeah. - Nice to... - [Scott] Nice to meet you too. - Scott? - [Scott] Yeah, yeah yeah. - Coach Scott? - [Kimberly] And I know her spirit will live in me forever.
