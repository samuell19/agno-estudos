Please bring the maths book in the night. Okay. Just take a quick look to that side one fish is coming out of the nets. I am feeling so sad.. ..by seeing that girl as she should.. ..have been wearing colorful saree at this age. Being a friend of mine you guys should be taking care of these things.. ..as she is wearing a saree like a widow. Boss, if you are feeling bad can we print the saree? Yes, print it but from where will you get the colors? Colors are in plenty when it comes to make you happy. What have you done? Favor, it's just a small favor from our side. You are an unmarried girl.. ..and you are roaming about by wearing a saree of a widow.. ..for which we felt very bad.. ..the reason which we printed your saree. We did not enjoy that.. ..much as the front part got printed.. ..but the back side is still like a widow. You should have told me earlier. What have you done guys? I have only one saree to go to school. I wash it in the night and wear it to school in the morning. I don't know whether the stains would go off post washing.. ..and then how can I go to school? What will you do by going to school? After few days you will have to go.. ..to your father in law's house and cook food. On a daily basis we set up a school here. You come with your books here wherein.. ..we will teach you how to live your life with fun and frolic. So many of you are standing here.. ..and watching that in the midday in the mid of the street.. ..these guys are insulting me.. ..and you people are laughing instead of protesting against them. You can cry to whatever extent.. ..but nobody can say anything against me in this area. Understood? Does anyone have the guts? What has happened? Nothing has happened yet but something will happen soon. The kind of drama that you have started.. ..in front of the mob I will put an end to it. Just wait. What is your name? Mini Mukherjee. Where do you live? I stay in the Choudhury colony. Okay you can go. Stop, stop, stop... go. Lets go. Now tell me what you wanted to say? Do you know who am I? I don't want to know who you are? But you loafers should know who am I? Loafer? Do you know Rana is the son of minister Ajit Choudhury? You know if he wishes What he can do with you? I have already seen what he can do. He has put tea in the saree of a little girl.. So what happened to you? I wished to do a favor. When I saw that you are doing favor to others then I thought.. ..that I should do favor for you as well. Look you don't like white color.. ..but still you are wearing white color.. ..so I thought of printing your white shirt. So how are you liking the shirt of your boss? How am I looking... Okay you did not like the color.. ..but tell me how will I come to know that.. ..which color would you like out of black, blue, green and yellow. Don't try to pull your hand, you will not be able to do it. Instead I am leaving your hand and would show you a different color. Just let me know whether you like the color or not. If you like the color.. ..I will not give you the color by one or two drops.. ..rather immerse your shirt in the same color and yours too. You might have seen.. ..there are pictures of Gods and Goddesses.. ..on the upper portion of the doors.. ..when somebody gets out through that door.. ..they pay respect and then go out. So you also do one thing.. ..I don't know what pic you have in your door.. ..but who so ever picture is there remove it and put your shirt there.. ..so that when you will go out you will see the shirt.. ..and remember my face.. ..and then you will decide that whether you will do favors to others or not. Still if you want to do favors to others then remember.. ..whether others will come or not.. ..Nawab will come for sure to do favors for you. Nawab, now take my answer. "Nawab, Nawab." "Nawab, Nawab." "Nawab, Nawab." "Nawab, Nawab." "Wherever there is any injustice or any wrong thing happening.." "..Nawab will come out of the earth to give the answer." "Nawab, Nawab." "Nawab, Nawab." "Nawab, Nawab." "Wherever there is any injustice or any wrong thing happening.." "..Nawab will come out of the earth to give the answer." "Nawab comes for the people who are not getting any food to eat." "Nawab comes to give food to the orphans.." "..who are not able to have any food to eat." "Nawab is not the God but he provides food to.." "..those who doesn't have anything to eat." "Nawab, Nawab." "Nawab, Nawab." "Nawab.." "Those who beat the poor and take all the things from them.." "..Nawab comes to the rescue of them." "Those who beat the poor and take all the things from them.." "..Nawab comes to the rescue of them." "Nawab will remove the poverty by distributing enough money to the poor." "Nawab, Nawab." "Nawab, Nawab." "Nawab." "Wherever there is any injustice or any wrong thing happening.." "..Nawab will come out of the earth to give the answer." "Nawab." "Nawab, Nawab." "Nawab, Nawab." Who are you guys? What do you want? You will not recognize us your daughter knows us. Call her. What do you want from her? Just an old calculation to solve, Where is she? Okay understood. She is in that room. No no don't do it. Get out of the way. No. I am telling you to get out of the way. You told that you had only one saree to wear to school.. ..but here you are wearing a new saree. When I told you in the morning I had one saree only.. ..but now I have lot of sarees. Great but how come the number of sarees changed from morning to evening? Where did you get them? Nawab brother has given me. Nawab! - Yes. From tomorrow I will wear new saree everyday to school. I will also take the new saree from you in the mid road everyday. So you will take away my saree. How many will you take? All the sarees that Nawab will give you. By spoiling one saree you got one hit on your nose.. ..so if you take so many sarees.. ..will you be able to bear so many hits on your nose? What did you say? Now tell me why did you come here? I have one important thing to tell you. Tell me Not here let us go to that room. Come. Guys stay there I am coming. Where are you? Wait, I am putting on the light. Why did you come to the bedroom? Should I give the answer to you? I want to tell you one thing that.. ..one who sleeps here gets up in the morning from this room.. ..but when somebody comes from outside to sleep.. ..I make them sleep in such a way that.. ..they wake up in the hospital bed only. So you will sleep alone or will bring your friends with you as well? You will be able to find a bed for you.. ..with your father's recommendation as a minister. I don't want to speak with you. I am also not wanting to talk to you. It is written in history that the Nawab's speak with the Ministers.. ..and not with the minister's sons. Go. If at all you want to speak with me send your father to me. There is a limit to the edacity. I will go and meet a hoodlum. Why are you getting so angry? Ministers makes a list of the hoodlums.. ..and they go to them in the night to give them money. Tell me from where does one hoodlum get the edacity to call me? If your son can show the edacity.. ..to put tea on one's saree in the midst of the road then ... Are you comparing him with my son? Why? He can do whatever he likes as he is your son or what? Very honest, so how many years you are wearing this uniform? Around six months. So it is not even 1 year.. ..so that is the reason.. ..why so many justified words are gushing out of your mouth. What do you want to say? Nawab have shed the blood of my son so he will have to pay for it. By trying to get the value of your son's blood don't undermine.. ..the cost of your seat. Never forget that you are the minister. I have not forgotten it rather you have forgotten it. You also forgot about the consequence. I know. Transfer. You will inform the SP and he in turn would tell his supervisor. After that I will have to leave this place. So you will not arrest Nawab? So till the time I am not getting transferred.. ..let me think whom to arrest and whom not? What does Nawab do? Who all are there in his family? Where does he live? Do you know? "Throughout my life I have walked in this way." "Throughout my life I have walked in this way." "I have worked for the mass in this way by loving the country." "Throughout my life I have walked in this way." "I have worked for the mass in this way by loving the country." "I will wipe out the tears if you cry." "If you want to live live happily and wipe out all tears." "I will wipe out the tears if you cry." "If you want to live live happily and wipe out all tears." "Respect everyone, don't be jealous of anyone. "I have worked for the mass in this way by loving the country." "You are my life and everything.." "..and all the noises would stop when my heart would stop." "You are my life and everything.." "..and all the noises would stop when my heart would stop." "I would like float in the ocean of happiness." "Throughout my life I have walked in this way." "I have worked for the mass in this way by loving the country." "Throughout my life I have walked in this way." "I have worked for the mass in this way by loving the country." So many renowned doctors are treating Piklu.. ..but his fever is not coming down. His fever will not come down.. ..that is why I am with him always. Wherever I go I take him with me. Let him live happily till the time he lives. Blood cancer never gets cured. I am in agreement with the doctor. Piklu is only living due to your care.. ..and the way you have cared for him as a mother. We have done whatever we have. Now everything depends on God. Now get to bed as it is too late now. Come. Will you say anything? Daily I don't want to tell you the same thing but.. I keep the pic of your husband and son with me all the time. Whenever I see them... Do you know my problem? When this pic was taken Raju's age was seven. Now 8 years have elapsed.. ..and his physique has changed a lot. As a mother also I would not be able to recognize him. Yes but your husband would remain the same. That is the only thing I can rely on. I cannot solve the calculation till date that why my husband did not return.. ..in a lonely station when he took Raju along with him to drink water. Why did he not return? Where did he go? That day I was crossing the Dhupgarh station by a train... Leave me. Leave me. Leave me. Help me. Leave me. Leave me. Leave me. Leave me. Whole night I tried to search for your husband and son .. ..but was not able to find them. At last I brought you here in this orphanage. You got 100 orphans against your own son. I love them like my own son. My entire day passes by staying with them.. ..but when I come to sleep in the room alone.. ..then I can hear clearly that Raju is crying and telling mother. At that point I am not able to hold myself. My heart gets broken down to pieces. How many days you will be able to confide things from Sarama? Trust me Gopal brother. For the last eight years, Sarama has buried a deep pain in her heart. I also bear another pain. The pain of hiding the truth. Every morning I wake up and wish to tell her everything.. ..but whenever she comes and stands in front of me.. ..I am not able to tell her anything.. ..but whenever she comes and stands in front of me.. Wearing a red saree.. ..and a huge vermillion dot on her forehead.. .. and a smile on her face.. I am not able to tell her to wipe off her vermilion.. ..as this is not the right of a widow. Mother, come here. Mother, come here. Mother, come here. Mother, come here. Mother I am feeling scared. I hope you will not leave me. I will not leave you and go anywhere. I hope you will also not leave me. Where will I go as I don't have anybody apart from you? Is he wanting to meet me? When I was about to leave he told me... Tell him that without appointment I don't meet. I don't have time. I did tell him the same.. ..but he said he also doesn't have time.. ..and if you don't meet him right now.. ..he will be forced to go to police station. Who is the person? That he did not tell me. He only said me to tell you that.. ..he wants to sit with you regarding some old calculations.. ..as he was released from jail today. What will I do sir? Should I tell the security to take him out. Bring him inside. How are you Ajit Brother? You should not have come here like this. Were you supposed to leave me there at that point of time? You have become a minister from a union leader. And me? What do you want? When I got this in my hand.. ..then I wish to take your life with this. Do not fear. I will not repeat the same mistake. As I had taken the life of a common man.. ..the Govt has taken 8 years of my life.. ..and if I take the life of a minister like you.. ..then I can go for life imprisonment. Tell me what you want without wasting time. Its late night now. Give me back my 8 years.. ..wherein I have stayed in jail for you leaving my wife and children. I am giving you one lakh rupees. You go away from this locality. One lakh rupees! You mean to say the cost of a minister like you is one lakh rupees? okay I am giving you 2 lakhs. Again that 2 lakhs? In the same way you told me that.. ..you will give me 2 lakh rupees for killing Animesh Mondol. You knew that if Animesh Mondol can be killed you would be the union leader.. ..and if you join hands with the owner you will get lot of money. I wanted some money for operating my wife.. ..for which I agreed to kill Animesh Mondol. You had taken me to a lonely station in a Zeep. There Animesh Brother was waiting.. ..to catch the train with his wife and son. Should I call Animesh brother? No. His wife would know everything. She knows you. - Yes I will have to think of a way. I will send somebody else to call him. You wait. - Ok. Mother I want to drink water. Are you very thirsty? - Ajit. Look. Please go with him and make him drink some water. Father. Don't say a single word. - Leave me. Come, come. Let him sit. Leave me and where are you taking me? Why are you holding my child? Leave him leave him I say you? You. Sit quietly. If you make sound I will cut your child's head. Ajit brother tell the car to stop. I am stopping the Zeep. Finish off both the father and the child. Listen to me. I beg of you. Hello did you finish off the work? I think so. Check whether he is breathing or not. Yes, Ajit brother the work is finished. My work is also finished. You fled by keeping me over there stranded. I got back home. I was not able to understand that such a small child of Animesh.. ..will help the police to catch me. Tell me exactly what is the amount you want? For Animesh 2 lakhs.. ..and for the 8 years you wasted of mine.. ..its 1 lakh per year.. ..which accounts to 10 lakhs. What are you thinking Ajit brother? I am thinking that even if I give you 10 lakhs.. ..how will go to your home in this stormy rainy night? You make me laugh. You have so many cars so you will drop me with one of your cars. By car? Okay. I am bringing the money. You sit. How long will I wait? You have made me wait since evening. Wait for some more time. You are not telling me anything and just making me sit. Today her father would return. Yes. You told me that your father works outside. She tells this to all. But actually... Mother You can lie to him but I cannot. Her father killed and ... Kill!! - He is getting released today. What happened? You are very stubborn. Its an engine failure due to heavy rains. Ok let me check. Hello. Its Ajit Choudhury speaking. What? Amal is dead! How? So sad. I am coming. You guys listened that Amal has died. Lets go. Sir did he belong to our party? You need not know whether he belongs to our party or not.. ..but now we need to tell that he was our party member only. If some other party claims the dead body? We will have to go there ahead of others. The elections are ahead. We need to show our grief by taking out a procession. Lets go. Move away, move away. How did he die? Probably he was walking along the street yesterday.. ..in the stormy and rainy night and got hit by a vehicle. Fool, fool, fool.. ..without any reason you killed Animesh.. ..and when you got released from jail.. ..you should have come and met me. What will you do crying? I am giving you thousand rupees. Keep it. My members will decorate his body.. ..and take him through the village to the funeral ghat. You don't have anybody. Yes I am here. You keep the money minister. Who are you? People call me Nawab. So you are the Nawab. - Yes. You go away from here with your gang. I am wanting to the last rites of him so where is the disconnect? I am protesting as you are trying.. ..to buy the body as I don't have any objection.. ..for you doing the last rites of him. Listen what he is telling? Yes he is telling the correct thing. You are the big brother.. ..but you have never come to look for us in the last 8 years. No I mean.. He was last seen with you in your Zeep. And that very night Mr. Animesh was killed. I don't know why did he kill? Whatever gains happened it happened for you. Animesh was killed and you became the leader. I am going. Look Mr. Minister. What your son is doing.. ..you need not go out for buying dead bodies. If you son is not able to rectify himself.. ..you will get his dead body sitting at home only. Go away. Gopal brother people are talking on the roads that.. ..the killer of Animesh Mondol has died of a car accident. Don't let Sarama get out. Keep an eye on her. Okay Don't get so scared. We will surely keep an eye and we will tell you before Nawab comes. He is absolutely right. Nawab may come anytime. Don't worry. My sister have not gone to school today.. ..whatever we intend to do we will have to do it today. Get out of the way. I can get out of the way.. ..if you can open the saree from your body. I will take the saree given by Nawab the son of a pig. Hello, yes speaking. Where are you calling from? Police Station. You have kept my son in the police station. Okay. I am leaving him as you are telling him to leave.. ..but in future mind it. Bye. Go. If you do the same thing again... Why do you take the law in your hands inspite of the police force being there. His bail is given by his father but.. ..who will give the bail for you. If you have the money bag do you think then it requires bail... You! - You will not know me. My name is Mili. Where is Nawab brother? No Mili is not there. She just went out. Tell her not to worry, she can go to school from tomorrow. I have told the OC and had done all the arrangements I am coming today. Listen can you give me some work in your orphanage. Work, here! Yes. I was not able to tell Nawab brother regarding this. Why your father doesn't work? My father isn't there. Okay. My father some days ago when he got released from jail... What do you mean by get released from jail? What did your father do? Why everybody knows in this village, did you not hear? How will she hear? Sarama has not gone outside of this house for the last 1 year. I am very afraid.. I am apprehending that.. ..if she comes to know... I am looking into it. Do you want to say something? I want to know something from you. Why did you not tell me even when you knew that my husband died 8 years ago? Why did you not tell me. What have I done? Why did you punish me like this? Tell me. Who told you? Mili came to me. Why did you not tell me. Don't remain quiet. I have tried to tell you innumerable times.. ..but I was not able to see. You willingly did not tell me. Sarama trust me... Last 8 years.. You lied to me and now you are telling me to believe you. Listen Sarama... What good deeds have you saved.. ..but that has been nullified by all our sins. The sin is for me and not for you. Moreover you have the vermilion by knowing that you are not a widow. But why? If I had heard that my husband died I would have gone to my village house. So you have brought me to a place 50 miles.. ..from my village you have kept me here.. ..just to look after your orphans. You know at all if the others don't know that.. ..I am not having any deficit in terms of money. I could have kept another one to look after the orphans.. but I would have not got such a mother like you. But what would you have done by going to the village? I would have known at least that.. ..my husband is not more and I would have looked for my son. I was having in mind that my son, wherever they are.. ..they are living together.. ..but now after 8 years.. ..I am coming to know that my husband is no more. I don't know where is my son and how is he now? "I am fine and I am doing well." Is it so? "I am fine and I am doing well." "My father's hotel is open." "Even if my father is a policeman he is a very straight man." "I am fine and I am doing well." "My father's hotel is open." "Even if my father is a policeman he is a very straight man." "My father is a minister.." "..and he swishes his stick here.." "..and there and we see his tantrums by sitting at home." "My father is a minister.." "..and he swishes his stick here.." "..and there and we see his tantrums by sitting at home." "Like father like son and all his team is like that only." "Its like Nandy is walking with Firingi on his shoulder." "He slipped and fell on the body of the other.." "..and was unable to lift him up." "I am fine and I am doing well." "My father's hotel is open." "Even if my father is a policeman he is a very straight man." "Look how I catch hold of the thief like my father." "This catch will not work so make them wear handcuffs." "Look how I catch hold of the thief like my father." "This catch will not work so make them wear handcuffs." "Now it calls me." "Who are you? - Now tell me." "Now it will pave the way of our life." "Then everybody will see the play of both the fathers." "I am fine and I am doing well." "My father's hotel is open." "Even if my father is a policeman he is a very straight man." Gopal brother.. ..can you tell me what is actually happening? What? It is so late in the day and Sarama has not opened the door. This has not happened in the last 8 years. Let me check. Sarama sister, Sarama sister. Sarama sister. Sarama. Sarama. - Sarama sister. I knew this kind of thing would happen someday. Sarama will misunderstand you. Where did she go? Yes around 8 years ago about 12 miles away from Dhupgunj station.. ..at the side of the canal we had found the body of Animesh Mondol. And my son? With him my son was also there. Your son? Your son is not mentioned in the report. But he was associated with his son when he went out of the station. So where did he go? That I would not be able to tell you. You can do one thing. If you can go to the officer in charge who was here 8 years ago.. ..then there is an outside chance that might get the news of your son. Where can I find him? That officer has now become the SP of Birbhum district. Whom do you want? I want to meet SP Sir. Tell her to go to office not here. I had told her Sir.. ..but she told me its very important.. ..and she would not take more than 2 minutes of your time. She will find out one thing and then go away. What information? She told me that prior to 8 years.. ..when you were the OC of Dhupgunj police station.. ..wherein the body of Animesh Mondol's body was found by the canal. ..she is his wife. Please do not turn your face from me. Tell me the truth. You need not tell me anything more.. ..but only tell me whether he is alive or not. He is not only alive but he has kept me alive as well. My Raju is alive. Where is he now? Papiya. Look he is my brother. Your father is a minister and everybody knows him. Only I have not seen him.. ..and don't know him as well but I know your brother. Do you know me? I was not knowing you earlier. I knew you when somebody called Nawab.. ..had beaten you very badly in front of your sister's school. He was beaten! You did not come on that day. If you had come you would have seen that as well. Did you see with your own eyes that Nawab had beaten me? Yes. That day I was waiting for Papiya near the school. Good that you have seen me. I will take you to my father.. ..where you will say that Nawab had beaten me up. Should I say only that he had beaten you.. ..or I will tell the reason as well. You will say that Nawab had beaten me without any reason.. ..and if you say so your father would put Nawab behind the bars. If I say I will say from the very beginning. I will say that you were pulling the saree of a school girl.. ..for which Nawab brother had beaten you up. So after hearing this my father will decide whom to put behind the bars.. ..you or Nawab. Shut up! You are having a love affair with my sister and you are... Yes I am having a love affair.. ..but I am not pulling her saree like you were doing. Look you are having a love affair with a guy.. ..who is not listening to my words. If he had listened to you I would have stopped mixing with him. What? Such a huge remark? What you need not go to school today. Lets go home. - Leave me brother. I say leave me. Lets go home. Brother. - Leave her. Then say that you will complain against Nawab in front of my father. No... Raju won't say that. You leave me. - You leave her. What I will leave her? Brother! Get up, get up. Get up. Where are you going? Look she wants to come to me.. ..and he is stopping her to come to me. Do you love her? Where are you taking her? Home. She is my sister. So what that she is your sister, she wants to go to him I will not let her go. This is the guy who had beaten your brother. Yes I will beat him today also.. ..if he does not leave her hand. I will not leave. His name is Nawab. Do you love him? Love is not sin or any wrong doing. Do you love him? Yes. Can you give the proof of your love? What proof you need tell me? Will you be able to dance by holding his hands in front of your brother? Yes. "If husband and wife is agreeing then what would the judge do?" "If husband and wife is agreeing then what would the judge do?" "Tell me." "What will the judge do?" "Tell me." "What will the judge do?" "If husband and wife is agreeing then what would the judge do?" "If husband and wife is agreeing then what would the judge do?" "When Radha Krishna have a love relationship.." "..then nothing is wrong but when these 2 are doing it is wrong." "Should I show you by opening the books.." "..or sing you a song on the same." "When Radha Krishna have a love relationship.." "..then nothing is wrong but when these 2 are doing it is wrong." "Go and check the date when you will get them married." "Go and check the date when you will get them married." "Tell me." "What will the judge do?" "Tell me." "What will the judge do?" "If husband and wife is agreeing then what would the judge do?" "If husband and wife is agreeing then what would the judge do?" "If you make love both body and soul.." "..remains well like light coming out of the darkness." "If you make love both body and soul.." "..remains well like light coming out of the darkness." "The bridegroom is not bad like you." "The bridegroom is not bad like you." "Tell me." "What will the judge do?" "Tell me." "What will the judge do?" "If husband and wife is agreeing then what would the judge do?" "If husband and wife is agreeing then what would the judge do?" Okay, okay. No, no. Don't. You can make love as you like.. ..and if anybody is objecting you please inform me. If required I will come to meet your father. But my father is not able to stand you? In that case I will go to meet your mother. I don't have any mother. I will go and meet your father and mother. I am going. What happened? Why did he go away when I asked about his father and mother. His father is not there. - Mother? And he doesn't know where is his mother or what is she doing now? What? - He used to live in a village called Dhupgunj. Dhupgunj? - Yes. Somebody killed his father in front of his own eyes. He came running to the police station.. ..and I went and arrested Amal from his house red handed with the knife. Then I took him to the railway station.. ..but I was not able to find you. I waited till late night and some bad guys were after me. I had beaten them and brought her to the Ashram. Do you know her mother? Yes I know. She had been with me in the ashram for the last 8 years. Where is she now? Even after a long search I was not able to find you. I had brought him to me.. ..and within 4 to 5 days I started to love him so much that.. ..one person came to me to collect the information of your husband and son.. ..but although I gave him the news of your husband's death.. ..I was not able to tell him that Raju is with me. I had confided the news of Raju. If you were on that day... That day like your mother's heart was crying.. ..in the same way one father's heart was also crying. I had one son like him and with 2 days fever he died. I felt that my son has come to me again. So shamelessly.. I kept him as an idol of my temple. If you want to take the idol from my temple I would not object you. I had sent off that person that day.. ..but whatever painful it might be for me.. ..I will not be able to send you away. You have no reason to fear.. ..as where I would be putting up the idol by taking it from your temple. My temple has been absolutely destroyed. It is the wish of all mothers that.. ..whatever sufferings, and hardships they bear.. ...they still think that their children should be safe and happy. The way he is growing up in your house.. ..I will not be able to do it myself. Why will I spoil his future? I only request you.. ..to make arrangements in such a way that I can see him 2 times in a day. Where did Sarama go leaving behind her saree, vermilion? Why don't you go and ask Raju's father regarding this? It can be so that he might do something for you. Are you Nawab? Yes, I am the person whom you bluffed prior to 8 years from now? You said... I remember what I told you. But I am not bound to tell you the reason. If it were 2 days earlier I would have brought Raju's mother to you. If you were not telling me the reason you would have told... What do you do? I have a orphanage out here. I come here twice in a year. I bring up those who don't have anybody to care. What do you do apart from this? Yes I do service in Delhi. I have the information that.. ..you are a hoodlum as well. I don't know what is the definition of hoodlum in police rule book.. ..but if somebody does anything wrong.. the way you people fear and stay in one corner in order to save.. ..your job due to some politicians, that I am unable to do. If somebody does anything wrong I protest and often beat them. If you tell this as a hoodlum activity... You don't forget that you are speaking in front of an SP. I am speaking with that SP.. ..for whom I have beaten the minister's son just few minutes back.. ..when he was beating your son. Your son loves Ajit's daughter.. ..and that is the reason the ministers son was beating him. I protested and had beaten the minister's son. If you say that this is a hoodlum activity then I will surely accept it. Are you not scared that you have beaten minister's son? You should be afraid but why will I be afraid? I don't have any seat to lose or get transferred. I will not budge a bit without my own wish. You have huge expenses to take care of the orphans. Where do get the money? You can easily go to the income tax department ..and search for my tax file. If I say you earn in an illegal way? I don't have the options like you to earn in an illegal way. What do you mean? Some of the police officers have black and white money.. ..they have their own houses and cars.. ..but the salary you get from the government.. ..you will not be able to buy a tyre also. Where do you get this money from... Do you have any problem to tell me from where do you get all this money? Although I am not bound to tell you.. ..but still I am telling you that its my father's money. How big is the amount that.. ..even after so much spending you are not getting empty? Do you know story about ocean? - Ocean story? It is like if you tell somebody.. ..to take out water from the ocean with a bucket. If you go after 30 years also you will see that ocean is in the same position.. ..and the guy is still taking out water from the ocean. What were your father doing? Have you heard the name of Kumar Pratap Roy Chowdhury? Yes the landowner who used to act as a tyrant by taking money from the poor. I am the only son of him. As a landowner the kind of sin that.. ..they have done by taking money from the poor.. ..I am spending that money among the poor. This is how I am trying to reduce my sins. I have kept the saree and ornaments of Sarama on the table.. ..please search for her. Listen. The way you are reducing the sin.. ..I am also doing the same thing starting today for the sin.. ..I had done 8 years ago. Raju's mother Sarama is with me now in my house. What? What happened? Father have you changed the cook? Why? Tell me if you have or haven't. Yes, why? The taste of the food is reminding me of my mother. I am having a feeling that my mother is standing near me. Okay eat. Trust me father whatever I had liked to eat in my birthday.. ..all are here in the table. The same taste... After you went out in the morning a lady came to me who was very poor. Lady? Was she my mother? The lady's face is burnt. That lady never showed her face.. ..as she had burnt her face in the childhood. If you have any doubt you can go and see her. No, no then she is a different lady but not my mother. My mother is very good looking. Just like a goddess's idol! She used to wear a red bordered saree.. ..with red vermilion in her head with a big red bindi on her forehead. Today also I can see the face of my mother. Hey, eat now. How come the taste of both the cooked food be the same. Why can't that be a possibility? I think.. - What? The one who came must be known to my mother. You eat and let me ask her that whether she knows her or not. First you eat and then go. You eat, I am coming. I am Raju the son of SP. As you are new I came to you to chat. Have you cooked the entire food by yourself today? You know the taste of the food cooked by my mother was the same. So the taste of your food reminded me of my mother. Prior to 8 years from now I lost my mother. I searched a lot but I did not find her. Do you know my mother? My mother's name is Sarama. I have a request that please never leave me.. ..promise me that you will never leave this house. ..when I eat your cooked food it reminds me of my mother. My father told me that you have come here due to poverty.. He will pay you whatever he can.. ..but if it is not up to your expectation.. ..also please do not go away from here. My father gives me 10 rupees everyday for tiffin.. ..I will give that to you as well. My father will not know about it. I had taken 50 rupees from my father in order to go to picnic.. ..i won't go on the picnic. ..but I will give that to you. It's here on the shelf. I wanted to cringe by touching your legs like my mother.. ..but father told me that you would not show your burnt face.. ..so I will cringe from a distance. Are you not feeling sleepy? You know father today I am thinking of my mother. I don't know why my mother has not looked for me over the years. Surely she would be looking for you. Mother cannot stay like that without looking for her child. You are such a big police officer, can't you fetch my mother for me? Tell me can't you do that. Are you not feeling good with me? Am I... No, no you have given me everything.. ..but what happened to me today I don't know. I am getting the scent of my mother in this entire house. I am feeling that my mother is staying near to me. That is wrong notion of yours. Go to sleep. Its very late in the night now. I am comforting you by putting my hands on your head. You know father when I was not feeling sleepy.. ..my mother used to give me comfort by brushing my hair with her fingers.. Okay. - ..and singing a lullaby. And I didn't even know when I used to fall asleep. I can hear it even now clearly. The lullaby mother used to sing.. "Let the sleep come down to the eyes of my loved one." "Let the sleep come down to the eyes of my loved one." "My love one is awake and the night is getting over." "Let the sleep come down to the eyes of my loved one." "Where does this sleep stay?" "These sleep stay in an unknown world in the house of the fairies.." "..and these fairies make the sleep in that room." "These sleep stay in an unknown world in the house of the fairies.." "..and these fairies make the sleep in that room." "Then the queen tells to give the sleep.." "..to the eyes of my loved one as the night is passing by." "Let the sleep come down to the eyes of my loved one." "The sleeps come and sits on the eyes.." "..and then they smile and tell you in your ears to sleep." "The sleeps come and sits on the eyes.." "..and then they smile and tell you in your ears to sleep." "Then everybody gets to sleep by closing their eyes." "My love one is awake and the night is getting over." "Let the sleep come down to the eyes of my loved one." Now try to sleep. What will you try to do? Sarama after such a long time has got his son back.. ..so will she come here now. I don't think so.. If Sarama doesn't come we cannot save Bikram. Whenever he is opening his eyes he is calling by the name of mother. Okay, let me go there once tomorrow. Where will you go? I am thinking of going back to the ashram. Leaving your son here... When I know that he is happy.. ..and keeping well here. Then I don't have any problem. I will come often to see him. But.. Moreover how long will I conceal my face from my son? When he was speaking about me at my back I was getting weak. I was feeling I will not be able to hold myself. I will run and take him to my chest. You should have done that. This could have satisfied me.. ..but on the other hand this could have given him lot of problems. This would have been unbearable for him. You are your mother and you know what to do... Is doctor there? Doctor has gone away. Doctor has gone away. Where has he gone by making so many patients waiting for him? Next month there is election.. ..so he had gone there for the meeting in the nearby ground. Like the way one donates for the people and people do not know him.. ..in the similar way the worker.. ..who works for the country nobody knows him as well. One of them is Mr. Ajit. Whatever he has done for you for the last 5 years.. ..you were not able to know as well. For the last 5 years the kind of problems.. ..that you are facing in terms of kerosene.. ..and electricity this will be put an end by him. Now he has changed his mind to change his symbol to bucket. He will give you electricity by bucket. Stupid, can anyone give electricity by bucket? Sorry he will provide you kerosene by buckets.. ..to each of the houses of the village. Now all of you will be in lights. Tell keep going, why did you stop? We will give you everything rice, pulses... We will give you everything rice, pulses... Come on. - Where? All your patients are waiting in your chamber.. ..and here you are giving lectures. You are not able to cater to 15 patients of yours.. ..then how can you serve your country. Come on. I will not go. You will have to go. Mother, mother. Mother! Where is my mother? You take care of Piklu, I am going to Sarama. Mother, mother. Mother, mother. Mother. Listen. - Yes. - Is your duty over? - Yes. Is SP there in the house? He has just got out for duty. What about that lady who came yesterday? She just few minutes back had gone away by leaving the house. There is no hope. Just you will have to wait for some time. We need to wait for the sunset. If Sarama could have come once. The one who left the house will never come back. Why are you all crying? Can't you see he is smiling. "When you see sadness then you should tell by going to that place.." "..if you want to live with a smile by wiping off tears." "You should take the child by your side.." "..and tell him to work for the mass by loving the country." "You are my life and you are my everything." "When my heart would stop that would be the end of all noises." Piklu. Piklu. Piklu. You have left me by showing your haughtiness.. ..but I have left my own son and came to you. Speak Piklu please look at me. Piklu. Piklu. Will it be possible to bring Raju here? Go and bring her. How will I get money for continuing his studies? Why are you thinking of the money when I am here? Moreover you are staying in this orphanage for the last 8 years.. ..for which if I give you... You also like Raju is trying to buy me? I serve them and love them like a mother not for money. That I know well but why are you taking so much pain in... I don't want to make SP sad by bringing him to me. Can you promise me one thing? Tell me - Take me once to the school.. ..wherein I can see Raju which would be make me happy. My dear Raju. I am leaving behind your money and my blessings. Like the way the food that I cook makes you remember your mother.. ..in the same way it makes me remember my son. If I stay in that house both of us will be sad so I am leaving. With love... Did you not sleep? If she had left her address? What would you have done? At least I would have asked for mercy. You don't have to ask for mercy. She has already forgiven you. That is the reason she has blessed you via letter. She does not know to what extent I have made her feel low. They belong to the clan of mothers ..so you cannot belittle them by thinking low about them. I am not able to see Raju. I think I can find him in another place. Do you know the news of Raju? How will he come? He is very sick. Sick... What happened? A lady cook came to his house 2 days earlier. Her food tasted like his mother's cooking. So.. He had collected his 10 rupees tiffin cost.. After not having anything for the whole day.. ..and wanted to give it to her but she left the house. He did not eat the entire day yesterday. Last night he did not get the food from.. ..that lady for which he did not eat. If he does like this it is obvious that he will fall sick. Nawab brother did you find his mother? Find her... Meaning... I think if he gets his mother back.. ..that lady has reminded him of his mother. I am thinking why that lady came.. ..and why did she leave by making him sick. Its sure that she does not have any kids. Lets see whether I can find her mother or not? Yes its late already and now he will not be willing to eat. See the stones. What happened? From where did you get this poor quality rice? From ration. What? From ration. The ration shops are not expected to give such poor quality rice. Leave aside humans the animals will also not eat it. They give us this quality regularly and we clean them up accordingly. Now let me see who is thinking me as animal whether.. ..the govt or the owner of the ration shop. If the owner has given us.. ..this bad quality rice instead of the good quality rice.. ..then I will also take him to roads like an animal. Oh God! You have hidden the good rice in the store room.. ..and you are giving the filthy rice to the people. Do you find the people of the country to be animals? No, not really.. I mean... Tomorrow make sure you exchange every single one of.. ..this sac with the bad rice in the grocery store. If you don't replace them.. ..then I will put the same in you. What happened to you? You told me to give you 10 sacks of good rice to your house.. ..and sell the filthy rice to the people.. ..by keeping the good rice in your storeroom. Tell me what happened after that. For this Nawab had pulled me through the market to the storeroom.. ..and he would have pierced my belly. You go and let me see. Now I know what is your capability? You are a leader, a leader of the country. Nawab had beaten your son in front of everybody.. ..for which you can't do anything then what will you do for me. During the vote I have given so many false votes.. ..and charged bombs and you said that nobody would be able to do anything. How will I come to know that all of a sudden.. ..how come the police have become so honest? Sir you call SP sir. If you tell him he will surely take action. If it costs 10 to 20k then I will give it. Hello. Ajit Choudhury speaking. Is SP sir there? What can I do for you? You will have to arrest Nawab now and put him to jail by today. Arrest? But I have told my officers not to arrest him. I am thinking of implementing a law which would help not to arrest anybody. What? Criminals will not get arrested. This was the law.. ..but you ministers always stop us from arresting criminals by saying that.. ..he is in our party so leave him. Otherwise my party members would show protest in front of your police station. But that doesn't mean... When we arrest a thief leaders say that they are in their party. If we arrest a rapist then its a different thing for.. ..which the expenses get high.. ..for petrol of the govt and phone bills of the leaders. This is the reason we decided that.... Whatever you decided, but arrest Nawab. So you are telling me to start arresting again. Whoever minister calls you even me.. ..if you receive any calls then don't listen to them. So lets go with you. Don't you know the Orphanage of Nawab? That I will find it out. But before that I need to go to your house. My house. - Yes. Why? - Look if I want to arrest somebody.. ..then we should start with the one who has the maximum amount of diaries. Tell me whether your son is at home or in front of a girls school. What? I will take the officers from the police station.. ..and put your son behind the bars. You have decide his name only. You will complain against me, right? I will twist the knee point of your son within the time.. ..it will take for your complaint to go to the respective. Okay, lets see. Please see to it. If your son is not able to rectify himself.. ..then I can go to your house at any point of time. Yes, you will come not to arrest my son but to save your job. Tell me who is the person who came here today? He is a minister whose name is Ajit Choudhury. "My father is a minister who takes care of Bengal.." "..and I get to see the tantrums of my father at home." "Like father like son both both are disciples of each other." Wait! You were asking me questions so now I will ask you a question. Who is this man? You only said it. That everybody knows.. ..but apart from this there is.. ..another identification of this guy which you know. So whats that? I have a girl friend named Papiya and he is the father of Papiya. Wait, whose father is he that I am not interested to know. Tell me what I want to know. How will I know? Raju I joined as a Constable and now I am a SP. You will not be able to escape from me. I said tell me, tell me, tell me. I have already told you father. You have not come to me without any reason in this sick condition of yours.. ..to know about the person. You are trying to hide things from me but why? Look straight to my eyes and tell me.. ..what is the other introduction that your know about him? Come on tell me. He is the person who had instructed to kill my father. You scoundrel. How can you think of marrying his daughter.. ..who had instructed to kill your father. I say tell me, don't remain quiet. I will go out now and you don't get out of the house till I come. Come, come. I knew you would come. You are clever but I think I am more clever than you.. ..for which I am the minister and you are the police officer. After I came back home I had spoken with your bosses wherein I found out that.. You have quite a reputation of being a just officer in your department. ..in your duty you never leave anyone. You have correctly heard it. Now you will get the proof red handed. I already said that I am more clever than you. Please give it to him. Read it. I see that this is an advance bail of your son but what about your bail? My bail? I have not come here to arrest a street loafer like your son.. ..by wasting the petrol of the govt. That will be taken care by the local police station officers. I have come here to arrest you. You have come to arrest me. Yes come with me. May I know the crime that I have done. Yes sure. Around 8 years prior from now you have killed Animesh Mondol.. ..by Amal under your instructions. Amal has died so did you get the information from Amal via plan chat? Yes Amal has died.. ..but it's quite unfortunate for you.. ..that the son of Animesh Mondol is still alive. He knows everything as the entire incident happened in front his eyes. After the death of Animesh Mondol.. ..his son is with me and he recognized you today. Come on. Yes but first you need to bring that lad in front of me.. ..and if he tells in front of others that.. ..his father was killed on my instructions.. ..you can surely arrest me. Okay I am coming along with him. Brother speaking. Hey! - Yes? - Why have you stopped the bus like this? The gear has gone bad sir. - Repair it fast. Hurry up. Hey! What happened to your vehicle? The vehicle broke down suddenly sir. - Suddenly! Hurry up! Nawab brother! Nawab brother, you go other road. My father has blocked the road. Raju? Raju? How did you end up like this? Some hoodlums came and had beaten me up. Where is, Raju? Raju is inside. Raju. Raju. Raju. Raju. Raju. Raju. Father! Father! I think you are not hurt. - No. When the hoodlums were trying to beat me.. ..then a lady came running towards me. A lady. Did you see her? When they were about to shoot me that lady pushed me away.. ..and she got the bullet on her back and she fell on her face. After that? Yes Nawab brother also came and he took her and went away. Surely she had gone to the hospital. Come lets go to the hospital. My mother! - Raju! Why did you not tell me earlier? I that case I would have not let the bullet hit my mother. How much time will it take to do the operation? It's a major surgery. It's going to take time. It will take around 2 hours. Will you stay here now? Yes. Okay, I am coming. Where are you going? I will have to do a major operation and that would hardly take half an hour. Nawab. I know where you are going. Don't take laws in your hands. You had laws in your hands all this time.. ..but what have you done with it? In a country wherein the hoodlums get into the house and shoot.. ..do you think that we have laws in a country like this? Tell me. I am telling you not to go. I will take care. If you wish also you will not be able to do anything.. ..till the time you are wearing this police uniform. Listen to me. - No, I will not listen to anything. I will get the minister here. If something happens with Sarama.. And the children in my orphanage become orphans again.. ..then I would book a bed for the minister in this hospital.. ..and I would do the operation of him. Nawab wait and don't go. With law, you could have tried, You can't stop me with this pistol of yours. Stop! Hello. Come. Come. And take the pad with you. Pad? Here. Take it. - Come on. Please leave him. What? What kind of cruelty is this? You had killed Animesh Mondol by giving instructions.. ..and for this you wanted proof from SP. You have killed so you have to give the proof. Please let me go. I will tell the court everything. I am giving you my word. - You are giving your word. Whatever promises you make to the public.. ..you forget it after coming home.. ..so you will not remember the promises you would make to me. Now write it in your own pad with your own hands.. ..that you have not only killed Animesh Mondol. ..you had also tried to kill his son by sending some gunmen to his house. Now write. Wait. Wait. Beware, don't touch the children. I won't write! - You will have to write minister. The hands that you have used to write.. ..all bluffs from your rise of a union leader.. ..to a minister will be needed to write 2 true things. You will write. - I will not write. Do not be stubborn. If you don't write I will remove your hands from your body. Write. - No. I am telling you to write. - No. Write, write. Write it . If you write it the court would give you an imprisonment of 7 to 8 years.. ..but if you don't write you will be.. ..getting death penalty from Nawab's court. Write it. So you will not write? No. So you will not write? Will you write? Yes, I will write Will you write? Yes I will write. Come, come. Here is the proof. Lets go. You go to the hospital by taking.. ..the children as lot of blood would be required. Okay lets go. The blood group of son and mother are not matching. Not matching. Doctor. Her blood group is not matching with one son. Here are so many children of her, one of them would surely match with her. Okay, please send them one by one. Let's see which of them would match the group of his mother. Your mother is now absolutely cure and has gone back to the orphanage. You will not bring her to me. Yes I will go. You also come with me. No. I will not be able to stand in front of your mother. It is due to my father... You don't have any fault here. Lets go so that I will introduce you to my mother.. ..and Nawab brother will also be there and I will tell about our affair as well. Shameless. Get the entire place surrounded. - Okay. Nawab should not get a chance to escape. - Okay. There. You go there. You will not go with me. How will I go? I will not be able to go without leaving them. Will you not be able to go to your own son leaving behind the orphans. Once I went there for which Piklu has gone away from me. I will not repeat that mistake again. How can you say its a wrong thing that a mother is coming to his son? I have given birth to you but these orphans have given back my life. I had given you few drops of blood to save you.. ..but here the children had given bottles of blood to save me. I will not go anywhere leaving them. Moreover to look after you he is there.. ..but no one is there to look after the orphans. There are lots of people to look after them. Gopal brother, Aunty, Nawab Brother, all of them are here. He won't stay here. - What? Where will Nawab brother go? Jail. Jail. I had given him sometime till the time Sarama is cured. Now he's under arrest. Why what is the crime he has committed? The way Ajit's gunmen shot you in the same way he had beaten me.. ..and taken the law on his own hands. What you were not able to do he had done it? He had given you Ajit who is an assassin and criminal. Yes we are grateful to him from the police department. To show your gratefulness you have come here.. to handcuff him instead of putting a garland around his neck. Sorry Madam. The crime that he has committed..... Please come. We will not let them take away our Nawab brother. Gopal brother why are so silent? Why are you not saying anything? Why are you not saying anything? Look I may not be anything to him but you love him.. ..so why don't you do anything? Please say something by looking at the face of the orphans. I am bowing in front of you please do something. He is silent as he knows that.. ..doing wrong is crime and tolerating crime is a much bigger offense. Even if you are protesting against a crime, breaking the law is a crime. No. Nawab. Nawab. Come out wherever you are. Your house has been surrounded. You are under arrest. Nawab. Nawab. Nawab. Lets go inside. Lets go sir. Will you stand like a stone statue? Gopal brother. What will I do tell me? Nawab does not like that any common man.. ..should intervene in any police activities. You should have told him to escape from here. Do you all get to know this about him over these years? He will not escape. Nawab. Where will you go Nawab? I am here. Sir, you. The things that were undone by wearing the police uniform has been done.. ..without wearing the police uniform. I was searching that from a level of a union leader.. ..to a minister how come Ajit had been able to make.. ..so much wealth and property. While doing so I saw some hoodlums were trying to ill treat Sarama. Then I came to Gopal brother's Orphanage. Gopal Brother used to work in police.. ..and one day accidentally one bullet from his pistol killed one common man.. ..and his 2 children became orphan. Due to this incident he left the police job and built this orphanage. My name is there only in this Orphanage as he sends money every month from Delhi. As an officer he is helping me to get relief from my sins. Sir you could have given your introduction earlier to me. I had once given my introduction to Bikash.. ..when he arrested me and took me to the police station. When police is there why are you taking the law in your hands. His bail would be given by his father but who will give your bail? If you have a money bag in your pocket do you require a bail? Wait, don't take that out. If you take that out I will put you behind the bars. Okay. Let me open the bag once. Nobody should know who I am. Nobody. I had to beat you at that point of time as I did not have any other option. Please excuse me. I am going Sarama, I am going Gopal brother. Why are you here? When I wanted to enter from the other gate.. ..I got your introduction from one of the policemen. I heard that your jeep is in this gate and you would be going out from this gate. Come. Sarama, her father was the person who instructed to kill your husband.. ..and she is the one who saved your son's life. If she had not told us.. I am going Sarama. Please don't leave us. Please don't leave us. Please don't leave us. You all come here let him go to work. "Throughout the life you need to work.." "..for the mass by loving your country." "When you see sadness then you should tell by going to that place.." "..if you want to live live with a smile..."
