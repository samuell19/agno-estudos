Are you kidding me? Rust Bank Brewery is the heart of this town. No deal, Mr. and Mrs. Klaxon. - Do you realize who I am? - We are not selling the brewery. Not to you or anyone else. - Wait, wait! - Got it? You shut that down, Delroy? It's over, Wilma. I told him more beer, less prisons. Whoo! Did real good here too! I love that! My library is set for the year. - Time to go, Kat. - Okay. - Before you put Mr. Fawzi out of business. - Daddy! Bye-bye, Kat! What's that, Kat? Uh… Uh, dessert! No, honey, you'll pop. Delroy, honey, pull over. I don't like this. W-We'll be fine, Wilma. Look, almost home. What, baby? Watch out! No! Delroy! Daddy! - Kat, you need to swim like we taught you. - No! - Mama! Aren't you coming? - Right behind you, baby! Mama, I'm scared! Now, listen to me, baby. You need to take a deep breath. Now, go! One scream, and my parents were gone. Figured I'd just hate myself for the rest of my life. But… fate had other ideas. They say everyone's got demons, right? My demons have names. Soul Jockeys! On the double! Welcome to the scariest place in the Underworld. I'm your host, Buffalo Belzer, and this is the Scream Faire! Yes! Shocking! Ooh, ouch. Look at you go! Ah! Ah! Okay. Okay, that's it! W-W-Wild, you're doin' it again! - Doing what, Wendell? - Stealin' the hair cream! That's just a bad plug right there. That's what that is. - Why'd you plant it? - It's not a bad plug. You're depriving that plug of its rightful nutrients. Need I remind you? It's your fault Belzer put us in jail for treason! And if he goes bald, he'll skin us both alive! Both? I'm not worried, Wendell. You're the one shootin' blanks. - Get... Get... Hey! - Oh! As your older brother, I demand you regurgitate that cream! Now, why would I do that? Wendell… Fresh cream ain't gonna revivify a bad plug. Did you just admit you've been stealing it? - Uh-huh. - Why?! 'Cause it tickles my tummy. That's the dumbest thing I've… What? I'm gonna kill you! I'mma throttle you from here to next Tue... Oh, hey, you right! That does feel kinda good. - Yeah, and the best part… - Oh? Three, two, one, and… Ooh, yeah! Yeah. Whoa. Whoa-ho-ho-ho! I'm having a... a vision, Wild! A green-headed girl. You see her too? I do. She seems so real! Freaky! Deaky! Get up! My mutinous sons! - And back to work! - Whoa! Uh, whoa! I felt her hand. Me too! With my folks dead, the next five years were hell. Yeah, I got into a little trouble. Okay, a lot of trouble. But at 13, I got a do-over at this fancy girls' school, RBC. Only problem… …it was back in Rust Bank. You okay, Kat? What? The bridge. You had a panic attack. I'm fine, Ms. Hunter. Dad's brewery. When did it burn down? It was at your parents' memorial. What? You were already in the group home upstate. You didn't need more bad news. Was anyone hurt? It was bad. Home definitely wasn't what it used to be. Seems that brewery fire had a domino effect, and the whole town had died. What's this Klax Korp? My old house! Good memories… They can hurt the most. But it wasn't just a do-over. Something else up at that school was pulling me back. Something that knew what I was before I did. Rust Bank Catholic. Fancy! Townies call it "Crust Stank." Okay, townie. What sort of girls go here? Prize poodles. All Best in Show. Whoa! It's Dad's Cyclops! Some other stuff too. Rust Bank Catholic was the first school to sign up for "Break the Cycle." I promised you would behave. Yeah, well, I didn't. Can you at least try? I bet my grandma's fry bread recipe on you. What the… What? So, you make this work! Huh? - Pinch! - Punch! First of the month! Now you say… - "A slap and a kick for being so quick." - What? Too slow! No returns! We are… Siobhan! Sweetie! Sloane! And this is Gabby Goat. Welcome to… RBC Girls! Ugh. - Don't be shy, Katherine Koniqua Elliot. - It's Kat! We've noodled up another idea. It's the cutest! Kay-Kay! Ugh! No, thanks! New name, new beginning! It's your do-over, Kay-Kay. And we're going to help you heal. There's holistic goat yoga each noon. Feed your soul, not your waistline. Evenings, we meditate for the environment. The earth resonates beneath our bums. And best of all… Our "Fashion for World Peace" event! Who knows? "Prison Chic" could be the next big thing. Now, let's get you moved in. Hey, don't touch! - What is it? - It's vintage. Touched it! What the... Hey, you! Did you see what she did? Kay-Kay just saved my life! Ah! Let go of me! - This way, Miss Elliot. - Headmaster's waiting. What's going on, Siobhan? How did she see it coming? I don't know. But I have a feeling Kay-Kay's the best thing to happen here in a long time. My door is always open! Ah! Welcome home, Miss Elliot, to Rust Bank. Ah? Whoa! Oh, ow. Ooh! And welcome to RBC Girls! I am Father Level Bests. And now, you're gonna kick me out. Oh, no! You just arrived, Miss Elliot. But you should a broke your back. I... Uh, God willing, we're going to break the cycle. A second chance for girls like you. Yeah. This school's in trouble, isn't it? You need that "Break the Cycle" money. Ah, and you… You need a fresh start. I told them, bring this damaged child home. Surround her with the best and brightest, and Katherine Koniqua Elliot... It's Kat! …will flourish. Ugh. You're an RBC Girl now. Huh? A-ha. The Klaxons. Do not dawdle. Whoa. Kay-Kay? Huh. You're the assassin! No, that brick was loose. Eyes ahead. You're drawing attention. - Thank God you saved her. - I didn't. - She got lucky. - She, uh… We used to be friends. You liked that prize poodle? Yeah. Why were you up that tower? It's an art project for when the snow melts. I'm Raúl. I don't do friends, Raúl. Bad things happen to people I'm close to. Like what? They die. Whoa. Traitor. Sorry I'm late. Adaptable nature. Ha! Now, this spectacular creature is called Thaumoctopus mimicus, the mimic octopus. It's the only creature that can change its body shape to fool predators and prey. Holy biscuits! Ooh! Wow! Oh, my! That's amazing. Now, you look like an adaptable girl. It's Kat. Well, come on up, Kat. Get a close-up of this marvelous mollusk! Kay-Kay! - Oh, no! - What's happening? Gabby! Ahh! Okay. Slow, deep breaths, Kat. Um, let's take a look. Oh! What's... What's on my hand? Ah, okay. You've never seen this before, right? Never. Uh, well, the mark proves that you're special, Kat. But it has to be our secret. Huh? - That's how I can protect you. - Protect me from what? That stupid octopus. It bit me, right? - It wasn't the octopus. - You're just protecting your job! Tell no one, Kat! So, what do we believe just happened? Sweetie? Kay-Kay is a sorceress! No, she's clearly telekinetic. Her mind can move matter. Well, I would posit that Kay-Kay is an interrupter. A disturber of the status quo. Oh, come on, Siobhan, leave her alone. It's none of your business, Ramona. I'm sorry, Raúl. I keep forgetting. Look at it. Our faire is so much better than Belzer's dump! But you couldn't keep your mouth shut. I know. I was braggin' to the wrong demon. Duh! When Belzer found out, he called this an insurrection, a rebellion! Now, we're stuck here for life! Guess we got what we deserve. "We"?! You have not begun to get what you deserve. - Whoa. - It's a bearzabubble! From the Land of the Living! Good news, cousins! You've got a Hell Maiden! That's the girl in our vision! Same one! Yes. I've marked her hand so you'll know. Marked her hand? Rejoice! It's a new day in your miserable lives. Hell Maidens are real, Wild. Imagine! She could summon us to the Land of the Living! But... But demons aren't allowed up there. I mean, Belzer claims it's dangerous. Dangerous? Wild, he never even been there. Then that's where we'll build our faire! What?! That's amazing, Wild. You're right! He would never know. Stick it to the man! Shh! Not so loud. We're right under his nose! So what do we do now? Think it's time to see our Hell Maiden. Got any spare hair cream? Let the re-visioning begin. Look at them. Bloody council members in their tiny houses. They blocked our prison before, Lane… And I'll blow beets if they block us again! I'm not optimistic, Irmgard. Can't bribe them, and they're... they're too clever to be… "…retired." Well, I have good news. We have a new girl at RBC. Full tuition! Sweet Siobhan told Mummy all about her. Now the state's paying him to take in criminals. That's our business model, Bests. How dare you compete with Klax Korp! Well, technically, it's not competing if you have no prison. He's right, Lane. We need our own council members to win the vote. Oh, yes, uh, the old-guard members. They would vote for you! Ooh! Where do we find them, Father? In the finest mausoleums in the cemetery. They're dead?! It's over, Bests. We are no longer going to prop you and your precious RBC up. Irmgard, Lane, I vouched for you the night of the brewery fire. Indeed. Pop his clogs. What's that, then? Drowning is so peaceful. Indeed, sweet Irmgard. Really, Raúl, your art project, now? It's the final part of the mural, Mami. Hi, Irwin. ¿Que pasa? What do you mean, "alleviate the situation?" But I am your top-earning paralegal. My success rate is higher than anyone on staff. But you know that I'm fighting to keep my house, right? What am I supposed to do now? I have a son to feed. No! A son, remember? Yes. I'm still investigating the fire. Look, Win, those workers were my friends, my neighbors. I... I know the Klaxons are dangerous. But if I can link them to the fire, we can stop the prison for good. All I need is an eye wit... Oh, so that's it? We're done? Don't you dare hang up on me! Coward! I really, really need to talk to you. Look, almost home. What, baby? Watch out! No! Delroy! Listen, listen to me, Kat. You need to swim like we taught you. All the way up. - Aren't you coming? - Right behind you, baby! Mama, I'm scared! Now, listen to me, baby. You need to take a deep breath. Now, go! Who are you? What are you doing in my dream? Greetings, Hell Maiden! Me? Uh… You... You've got the mark, right? Tell no one, Kat! What mark? I don't have a mark. Sure, you do. It's right there. Hey! What do you want? We are Wendell and Wild. - Your personal demons. - Who? Well, you can summon us to the Land of the Living. - Why would I do that? - 'Cause we'll give you whatever you want. Huh. Only thing I want is my parents. And they're dead. Uh-huh. Conference. - We can't raise the dead. - Well, we do know how to lie. Oh! I like that plan. - No problemo! - That's right! You do your bit… And we'll bring 'em back alive. That's ridiculous. - Well, I mean... - What do you got to lose? Fine. So what do I do? - Okay, now, first, find Bearz-a-bub. - What's a Bearz-a-bub? Finds Hell Maidens for demons. Found you for us. - Well, it marked your hand so we'd know. - Then what? Then, you take it to the grave site next full moon. - It'll tell you what to do. - Oh, yeah, one more thing! You gotta have a witness! Bearz-a-bub. Bearz-a-bub? Thief! Sister… Helley is a… Thief! - Huh? - Eh? Come back here, spy! Hmm? Oh, Helley. You should have returned it. Now, we'll both be in the dark. Wakey-wakey, souls of the danged! It's your Scream Faire Daddy! Say my name! Belzer! Say my name! Belzer! Say my name! Belzer! Jeez! Can... Can you believe that vainglorious blowhard? It's love him, can't leave him. Danged souls have to praise him! At our faire, folks'll be lined up wantin' to get in! Indeed! Only, how are we gonna pay for it? I know how. Yes, Wild? Remember that rich soul of the danged? What, the... the Nigerian Prince? Yeah. He said if we helped him escape, he'd... That's nothing but a scam, Wild! That's sound financial planning! How 'bout I snap your horns off, rub 'em together, and make a fire? Ugh! Disgusting! Huh? Stop the cart. Stop the cart! All right, okay! That tick was dead. Why you messin' with me, Wild? We got a serious problem to solve, and... and you up here talkin'... Do it again! Whoa! See, Wendell? I bet folks would pay a lot to come back from the dead, right? Yeah, sure, only that was just a tick. We need to test the cream on something bigger. Hey, Spark Plug… Uh, what if we can't bring him back to life? I couldn't live with myself. Me neither. Look, a full moon'll be rising soon! Got our very own Hell Maiden to summon us up! We'll dig up her parents and test the cream! And if it works? There'll be plenty of dough to build our faire! Oh! Gonna need transportation funds. …we commend our brother… A full moon. Kay-Kay, sometimes it's harder to let go when you've just met. No, it's not. Father Bests saved your life. Maybe he was just trying to save the school. Kay-Kay, it's customary to cast one's carnation on the lowering coffin. Not Kay-Kay! Not my custom. Time to say goodbye, Kay-Kay. Fine! Goodbye! - Oh! - Aw! - You're comin' with me. - What for? I need a witness, and you're it. Why do those poodles keep bothering me? They want you to be like them. Heh. Uh… Wow, you were a poodle too. I… I tried to be but… You're not nearly as annoying. Siobhan's okay, considering her parents. Her parents? The Klaxons. Klax Korp? She's a Klaxon? There we go. And… boom, done, okay. Oh, gosh! Did I make a sculpture or a mirror? You know what I'm sayin'? Oh. Nope. That's not gonna work. Well, there we go. I'm doin' somethin'... I'm doin' somethin' important. Come on, Hell Maiden, summon us up! Ms. Hunter said it was bad. Come on. My mother thinks the fire was on purpose. Needs a witness to prove it. Hmm. Your parents? Mm-hmm. You're, uh, gonna make a shrine? Nope. Okay, now, tell me what to do. About what? Not you, Raúl, the bear. Ah! Hand me to the Hell Maiden. Hell Maiden? Kat. Good. Now, repeat after me. What's going on, Kat? Look, I made a deal. I'm bringing my parents back. What? Shush! Per Virginem facultates, infernum… Per Virginem facultates, infernum… …aperire port as… …aperire port as… …ut red eat daemones parentibus. …ut red eat daemones parentibus. I've got the cream here. I'm gonna put this… It's the summoning! - The summoning! - The summoning spell! The summoning spell! Let's go! Flap it! Flap it! Flap it! Flap it! - Flap it! Flap it! - Here we go! Attaboy, Sparky. Attaboy, Sparky. Shhh… Easy, Sparky, easy. Here we go… Way to go, Soul Jockeys! Whoa! Oh! Go back to sleep, go back to sleep! Ooh, that was close! What? Yes! Hi-ho, Hell Maiden! We're here! Whoo! Um… Yoo-hoo? Don't be shy, now! No, no, please! Come on! Say something! Tell me what to do! Please! They lied to me! Well… Hi, Sister Helley. Why weren't you two on the bus? - Uh, Kat needed me to be a witness? - It's my fault. Didn't want to see my parents' grave alone. I see. Well, we have a long, cold walk back. Eh, she'll show up at some point. Meanwhile… I say it's time to test the cream! Look, a fresh-dug grave! Time to eat dirt, Sparky! Here we go. Ooh, that is one messed-up man of the cloth. Sure, but if we can raise him up, we can raise up anyone in the cemetery. - Wendell? - Mm-hmm? It's not working. Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! - It worked! - Whoo! - Who did it? - We did it! Dear God! I'm in Hell! No way, Padre! You're back in good ol' Rust Bank, fully alive! Thank you, Lord, for this miracle! Not Him! We brought you back! - What? - Wendell and Wild! You? But you're demons. Don't worry, Padre. We are the Magician Morticians. The artistes of the afterlife. Okay. And… Ta-da! Y-Y-Your work is remarkable! Now, as far as payment goes… Um, uh, I have to pay you? How much? Everything you've got. Yeah, we're gonna build the best bemusement park ever! - We're gonna call it the Dream Faire! - Huh? And you, and all your neighbors around here, gonna pay for it. I... I... I need to show you something. - Huh? - Come. This… is Rust Bank. Take a look. No jobs. No banks. No people. Go ahead, raise all the dead you want, but there's no one here to pay for this faire. What's to stop us from puttin' your janky ass back in the ground? Yeah, your janky, stanky ass. He's right, Lane. We need our own council members to win the vote. Oh, yes, uh, the old-guard members. They would vote for you! W-W-Wait! Wait. I just had a vision. Uh, uh, the Klaxons, uh, would gladly pay for your services. - Enough to build our Dream Faire? - With all the trimmings? Uh-huh. All that, and enough to save my school. Well, here we are, Kat. Just tell me one thing before you go. Is our secret safe? I know what you are, Kat. You're a Hell Maiden. But how could you know that? I'm… kind of an expert. And you do not want certain parties finding out about you. Why do you care about me? I care because I was just like you. Oh, so you were stupid too! - You aren't stupid, Kat. - Stupid enough to get my parents killed! Stupid enough to just watch 'em drown, not even try to help! Stupid enough to believe they could ever... Stop! It couldn't have all been your fault, Kat. You're nothing like me! We were so worried, Kay-Kay, when you didn't get on the bus. - Where were you? - You gonna arrest me, Klax Korp? - Arrest you? - You are the prison people. Why, yes, private prisons. With trauma therapy, full detox, and whole-being cleanses. You ever been inside a private prison? Well, no. I didn't think so. It's the cutest. That dream you had… Maybe it was just some students messing with you. I said they were demons, Raúl! My personal demons. And they lied! Hmm. Maybe demons aren't the most trustworthy creatures to make a deal with. Good morning, RBC! It's your very own Father Bests. Reports of my death were greatly exaggerated. What?! So, I am back on the job, guiding this glorious institution into the future. It's dear Father Bests! - Alive! - Oh, my God! All right, everyone! Everyone, okay. Please, stay calm! - Just... - It's got to be a miracle, right? Whoo! Come on! Kay-Kay? They were supposed to bring my parents back, not you! Oh, uh, my-my… Oh, my! Really, Miss Elliot? Ugh! Perhaps, I'm just more important than your parents. Oh, you creepy old dude! Forgive me, Father, but you wouldn't even be here without Kat. How is that, exactly? She's the one who summoned those demons... - Shh! - Ow! Well, if you can't explain yourselves, I have better things to do. Code seven, code seven! Hostage situation in the headmaster's... - What?! - Penguins deploy! We're not holding you hostage. Uh, children, life is precious. Right now, you're wasting mine. Girlie, move it! What the bloody hell? Bests' phone! Father Bests, undead. - Hmm. - How's it possible, Manberg? Remember your first demon, Helley? You were just 12 when we captured it. Yes, made me summon demons, just so you could add them to your stupid collection. I made you my right foot of justice, and you quit on me! It had nothing to do with justice! It was entrapment. It was wrong. There's a new Hell Maiden at RBC, isn't there? She's… She's safe! My bear would've told me she'd arrived, given me time to train and protect her. But you stole it from me. And the new Hell Maiden has stolen it from you. I'll be waiting, Helley. Uh… Hmm. - No laughing. - Back to work! Manberg was right. Finally. Sister Daley! Sister Chinstrap! Come on, wake up! You're going alone? They're demons! My demons, Raúl, my problem. Open the door. - It's an emergency! - Oh! - Chinstrap! - Oh! - Wake up! - Ooh! Now, where are Kat and Raúl? Kat! Raúl! It sounded just like him on the phone. It couldn't have been. We drowned him right here. - You're supposed to be dead! - You look bloody hideous! I like my new look. Get him, Lane! Come here, you little… Oh! Gonna pop your clogs permanently! Wait! I-I-I can get you the votes! - Ah! - For our new prison? How? The council votes tomorrow! These are my partners, Wendell and Wild. Um, we raised Padre, here. From the dead. Now, they can raise the old-guard members you need. The ones rotting in the cemetery? Sure! Have 'em all cleaned up, ready to vote by morning. Yes! Get those prison votes, and we'll make you rich. Rich enough to build our Dream Faire? Certainly! We'll pull the permits, fast-track construction... And Bob's your uncle! What about my school? Of course, Father. RBC shall have our full financial support now! Mmm. Those brewery workers are in the same cemetery. Gah! By the way, do you plan to raise anyone else from the dead? Well, uh, our Hell Maiden's parents... No, no! No, no, no, no, no! If you raise anyone else in the cemetery... It's no funfair, no RBC money! - What? Hey, wait a minute... - I promise! Just your voters will be raised. Fine. Toodle-pip! Well, there they are, Wild. The old-guard graves? Exactly. All parked in a row. How convenient! Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. What's wrong, boy? Ow! Where were you? Hell Maiden! Stop! Stop it! You promised my parents! Ch... Wha... You weren't here! Yeah, you weren't up in here. So, we... we made Bests our guinea pig. - Uh-huh. - Check this out. Ooh! What's that? Oh, that's our secret sauce. That stuff'll bring my parents back? - Yep. - Um… Great! Let's go! Klaxon said game over if we raise anyone else! - Ho-Ho-Ho-Hold on, now! Hold on. - Not just yet! See… That... That... That's not how it works… anymore. - Mmm. - Well, first, you got to… to… To swear allegiance. - That's right! - That wasn't the deal! Hell Maiden, do you promise to serve us… For all eternity! - You've gotta be kidding me. - Stop, Kat! Stop! Leave it, Raúl! The heck is he doin' up there? Fine. Swear it. What'd you do, Wild? Wasn't me, Wendell. Skull mouth did it. Huh. Uh… Uh, for your first task… I know! Get us some take-out. We're starving! Only place left is… Fawzi's Falafel. I'll help. Oh, no. You and Sparky got graves to dig. Warned you, Raúl, bad things happen to people I'm close to. Come on, we haven't got all night. One… …two, three, four, five… Welcome back! Good to see you! Makeover time, let's go! Makeover time! Hello! Come on out. Remember, vote pro-prison! Woo-hoo! - Whoa, that group was challenging! - Little dab to celebrate? What are you doing? Ticklin' our tummies. Hey, we earned it. Stop! There won't be any left for Kat's parents! I love that little Hell Maiden, but… If we raise her parents, the Klaxons won't build our Dream Faire. Mm-hmm. I am so happy you're back, Kat! Rust Bank needs some bright colors. Smells so good, Mr. Fawzi. You want the hot sauce, right? - Yeah. - Take the whole bottle. - And hey, don't be a stranger, hmm? - Thanks. Okay. Delroy. Wilma? What… h-happened? Uh, hey. You two need to head to town. Find Kat. Kat's here? Yes. What's your name, son? Raúl. Now, please, hurry! You stole our cream, Raúl. Raised up our Hell Maiden's parents! Something ain't right up there. Wake up, you bums. Got a hair emergency. Wake up, c'mon, wake up! Fine. Ugh. You boys look terrible. What? Hmm! Soul Jockeys! On the double! What the… Yeah! Hey! How many dead folks have they raised? What? Ah! Is that you, Kat? You've grown so much! Mom! Dad! It's... It's okay. I got you back. Aw! Mmm. It's so wonderful to see you, Kat, but how is this possible? Why are we alive now? Doesn't matter, does it? Hey! I still have the Cyclops, Dad. That boom box could shake a room. And this too, Mom. Was wondering where that went. Hmm. I swear I told these people no deal. Damn Klax Korp signs are everywhere! You're a lot tougher, aren't you? Had to be, since I… I killed you. You... You didn't kill us, Kat. Only reason you crashed is 'cause I screamed. It was an accident, Kat. You were only eight, Kat. Your... Your hand! Whoa! Wha... Wha... What? Kat! Wh-Whoa! Look, I made this deal with some demon brothers. - Demons? - Demons? Why? Because they promised to bring you back to life. And they did! It wasn't demons. It was... It was this kid, Raúl. Raúl? Said he was your friend. I... I don't have friends. - He's in danger, isn't he? - Maybe. If he's in danger, then we gotta go help him. But I just got you back! Friends are like family, Kat. We do whatever we can for them. Fine, fine! I'll take care of Raúl. You two just stay in the house where I can find you again. Save him, baby. But be careful. Oh, no, no, no, no, no! What are we gonna do, Wendell? If the Klaxons find out, our faire is toast! - You gotta tell the Padre. - No, you have to tell him. You're older, Wendell. You have to do it. Pipe down, Spark Plug! Can't hear ourselves think! - Kat! - Shh! I swear... You hear somethin'? I smell somethin'. Our falafel dinner? You greedy bug's turd! You ate our Hell Maiden! Oh, and you ate little Raúl as well. I am literally traumatized! I'mma miss this cream when it's gone. Yeah, well, not as much as old Belzer. Where are they? So, you took my last two sons to the Land of the Living? With my magic hair cream? Mm-hmm. See? That wasn't so hard, right? No. Thanks for saving me. We're still not friends, Raúl. You stole Bearz-a-bub. And you summoned your demons. Let go! My parents are waiting. Your… dead parents? It was my fault they died. I had to get them back. Let go of me! Demons can't bring back the dead. Well, they had this magic hair cream. Uh… Raúl, tell Kat's parents I'll need her for a while. Why should I do anything you tell me? You too? That's right. Manberg, we need your help. Really? My bear! Oh, have you missed me, evil thing? Now, Manberg. Fine, fine. Wow. She has sworn allegiance to her demons. And the fever is spreading. My fault. Well, only one thing to do… Full quarantine! You... You don't understand, Manberg. Kat's demons are raising an army of the dead! A whole army, you say? Yes! And we'll need two Hell Maidens to stop them! So, now what? Blood-bind us, Manberg. Blood-bind could kill you. Just do it! Ah! Now, open the Redemption Chamber, Manberg. Worst bunions ever! There's nothin' to be happy about anymore. Don't need this kind of aggravation. Some say Rust Bank is already lost, a ghost town. - Oy! - So, why block Klax Korp again? Because I know they caused the fire that killed our friends and destroyed this town. - You're preaching to the choir, honey. - Let's get to voting! Of course, ladies. All here in favor of Klax Korp Prison, raise your right hand. - Boo! - Over my dead body! Now, all opposed. Ooh! Zombies? - Corpses! - We're being invaded! Uh, perdóname, but this is... Is council members only! Colonel Bumstrop, is that you? My Lord, Cassandra, it's the old-guard members! But they died! Years ago! In my professional opinion, these men are alive. Come on, Doc, you're just a foot guy. Podiatrists are real doctors... Shh! It seems they do have a right to be here and the right to vote. Mariana, have you lost your mind? I have to, Fawzi. All living council members get to vote. All those in favor of Klax Korp Prison, raise your right hand. The yays have it, six to five. Holy moly! Can that really be correct? Their votes actually count? Sí. They won. No! Finally! Oh, excellent work, Father! Hear, hear! This'll keep you in wafers and wine. Eh, my school and my partners thank you. Ah, and bless you, my child. F-Father Bests! Toodle-oo! Siobhan! Come join the celebration! We've finally won the vote! Uh… Mummy, Daddy, I know the truth about your prisons. And what is that, Siobhan? Well, you make a pile of money for every prisoner you take. So you pack them in like sardines, provide crap food, crap medical, dangerous conditions, and zero rehabilitation. I am proud of you, dear. That's our business model, exactly. Don't some people deserve a second chance? Like Kay-Kay? Oh, we love those Break the Cycle kids. Going to bus them in by the hundreds to your school. Then, we make it impossible for them to succeed there. And when they fail… Our new prison will be waiting with open arms. You're really going to do it, aren't you? Demolish Rust Bank? First thing tomorrow! The governor's coming, the press. Everybody will be there. Promise you'll be there, Siobhan. All smiles? Uh, I have to go now. I... I have to feed Gabby. I want my promise! Oh, I'll be there, Mummy. I promise. That's my girl! Kat, your memories are what fuels the fever. My memories? Yes. Time to face your past. Ready? Mm-hmm. No! I swear it… Your memories made this monster! Ow! Make it stop, Sister Helley, please! Only you can do that, Kat. It's too strong… You are stronger! Go on now, own your memories! You've tortured me for years. But you made me a survivor! And crazy powerful! I'm in control of my life now! Not you! Kat! Partners! Look! We're rich! Come on, what's wrong, huh? We saved RBC and the faire! Can't keep that money. - Why not? - Um… Raisin' the dead didn't stop with the old guard. You... You raised Kat's parents? Wasn't us. Was our ungrateful gravedigger! Him?! Oh, no, no, no, no, no! Yes! Hitch up the wagon! So what's the game plan, Padre? Ding-Dong Ditch… with a twist! Kat! Kat! You did it. And now… …your power. Touched it. I... I can see the future. Oh, no. Helley's in trouble! Open up! I'm coming for you, boys. Soul Jockeys! Yah! It's Kat! Almost there, Kat. Hey, baby! Hey! You! - What's goin' on? - Oh, no, oh, my! I can see your hat. - Ding-dong! - Gotcha! Who are you? Sister Helley. She passed out, cracked her head. Oh! Talk to me, Helley. You don't get to smack me. You're alive! Barely. What about Kat? Hmm. Good. You broke the fever, Helley. She is clear. Thank you so much, Sister Helley! We made it. This... This new power… It'll be unpredictable at first, but then... Thank God, Kat! I've been looking all... More demons? I collect them. - Why are you here, Raúl? - Your parents, Kat. They're gonna put them back in the ground. I just know it! I'm going to kill Wendell and Wild! With two Hell Maidens, we cannot fail! Go ahead, Manberg. This Maiden needs a moment. Fine, but don't be long. Kay-Kay? It's me, Siobhan. And your biggest fan! Fine. I... I deserve the silent treatment. But there's an emergency. Kat? Bad goat, Gabby! Put that down! Gabby, stop! Where are you going? Gabby! Hey, aren't you forgetting something? - Oh. - Yeah. Huh? So, any last words? Huh. I thought you'd be taller. I am taller. Are those cartoon mallets? What? Cartoon mallets?! Padre! Ah, yes. May the Lord look kindly on you and give you everlasting peace. Ow! - All right, here it comes! - One, two… - Boom! - Ow! Kat was scarier when she was three. And I'm way scarier now! - Hell Maiden! - You're alive! Let my parents go! It's, um... N-No can do, Hell Maiden. You see… Uh, you s... What... You still got 800 tasks to complete. That is right. So, as your masters, we order you to turn around and, uh… Pfft! You're trippin'! I'm not your puppet anymore. Dang right! - Spark Plug! - Help, Sparky! You disappoint me, Father. Oh. Oh, no. Kat. Why'd you do it? Uh, they... they... They were just my size, and I... Not the boots, my parents! Why were you putting them in their graves? P-Padre here said it was the only way. To save our Dream Faire. And it was the only way to save my school. What? Gabby Goat? Hello? - What? - Who's she? What's going on here, Kay-Kay? Well, for starters, Sister Helley and I are Hell Maidens. And if you call me Kay-Kay one more time... O-Of course, you are a Hell Maiden, Kat. Father Bests, my parents don't want to save your school. - Huh? - Or build some funfair. But they already paid us. Ahhh! Wh-Wh-What is this? It's how they pay all Klax Korp personnel. Worthless in the real world. I need to show you something. You were right, Kat, about my parents. Private prisons. We have to stop them. It's too late. What... What do you mean? There's not gonna be a Rust Bank anymore! You saw the future. What's going on? Delroy? It's him! Fee-fi-fo-fum. I smell the blood of two thieving bums! Oh, this is better than the undead army! Where's my hair cream? You stole it! Now he's gonna kill us! Everyone, down to the hearse, and don't draw attention! Wendell? Wild? I know you're up here! Now, come on, boys, I'm not going to hurt you. My greatest prize ever! What the?! Who's messing… - Come on! - Let's go! There you are, my thieving mutts! Scream Faire Daddy's gonna strum… Your… …guts! Uh, no, you don't! - Yeah, all right, man! - Yeah! All right! Got you! Why did you do it? Wh-Wh-Wh-What, steal your cream? Come to the Land of the Living? Well, why wouldn't we? Dad! My Scream Faire did not need some radical new design! Does now. Oh! My cream… It's all gone! Raúl's art project. A parent… protecting their child. What we all try to do. Every parent. Not me. There were others before you that ran away. We had siblings? "Hell with them," I said. "They'll be back, tails between their legs." But they never came home. Hello, up there! Demon Lord! It's Buffalo Belzer. Fine, Mr. Belzer. I, Manberg the Merciless, am a sworn enemy of demons, but not of families. Is that you, Belissa? I have all your missing children. Go on. Let my friends go, and they're yours. I accept, Manberg the Merciful. "Merci-less"! Gnasher, Wincer, Heddie. Look at you, Zostril! Let me tell you, uh, reports of my death were greatly exaggerated… He dead again? Gave him plenty of cream. Dang, you raised him from the dead with hair cream? Well… yes. Come on, boys, that stuff just don't last. "Stuff don't last"? Don't be long, sons. Can't build a new faire without the designers. - You mean us? - We'll make you proud, Pop! That's right! "Stuff don't last"? What about my parents?! No, a-a-all that's required is a... a fresh dose of cream. Worked for Padre. It's empty! - Squeeze it right, be enough for days. - Weeks! Hmm. Now we have loved every single second with you, baby, but Rust Bank's in trouble. What if that last bit of magic could help save our town? I already told you it's too late! No, Kat, you can change that future. Really? My mother thinks the fire was on purpose. Needs a witness to prove it. Raúl, raise a dead brew worker. Oh, a witness. If you squeeze it right, be enough for two. Three witnesses! Meanwhile, we're gonna protect Rust Bank 'til he gets back. That's it, Kat! Everyone, ready to hold that line? Let's do this! Oh, yeah! Down with Klax Korp! Down with Klax Korp! Down with Klax Korp! Down with Klax Korp! But Lane, Siobhan promised Mummy she'd come! We have to start, Irmgard. Governor Bribes. No more Klax Korp! No more Klax Korp! No more Klax Korp! Good morning, voters! Today, it's out with the old and in with the newest, biggest construction project in our state's history! Now, my partners in crime, Lane and Irmgard Klaxon! Thank you. Thank you. No need, thank you. When your governor offered us millions to build our prison here, we fell in love with Rust Bank. A love sorely tested by that lot! We blocked you every year! Should I do the honors, Irmgard? Don't mind if I do. Gentlemen, start your engines! And it's ready, steady... Wait! Look! Dear God, Siobhan's been brainwashed! Go! Go! Go! Crush them all! Let's go! That future ain't gonna happen! My bear! Your parents! Wendell, look! Good old Soul Jockeys. Dad must've sent them. Lane and Irmgard Klaxon, you're under arrest for arson and homicide. What?! That's preposterous! Can't prove a bloody thing without witnesses! Officers, your witnesses. Wait, wait! It was all her doing! - My wife's the murderer, not me! - How dare you, Lane?! Good news, everyone! Klax Korp is finished! You did it! We did it! Victory! Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. Poor Hell Maiden. Cream lost its magic. Mom, Dad… Tell us… Tell us about Rust Bank, Kat, in the future. What... What do you see? Hold tight, and close your eyes. Rust Bank's comin' back to life. Folks comin' home. I'm doin' stuff with Sister Helley and Ms. Hunter. So proud of you, baby. - How much do we love her, Delroy? - So, so, so much. I love you too. You know, once our Dream Faire gets built… It's gonna be about the best afterlife, upstairs or down. What do you mean? Your parents! Yeah, get them an all-inclusive VIP pass! That's ridiculous. Well, now, hold on. J-J-Just... Just check it out. Wow! Wow! Holy moly! Oh, my gosh! I was supposed to hate myself for the rest of my life. Mom, Dad, I… What do you think? But now, I don't have to. I'm a Hell Maiden with amazing friends. Even you, Wendell and Wild. Hi, guys. It's pretty late. It's 3:30 in the morning. And I just woke up because I heard some noises next door, in the room next door, and you won't believe what... what I found. Come with me. So… I'm going to open the door now. Shh. Hello. Hey, where are you hiding? Come on. Ah, here you are. Hi, Kat. How are you? What are you doing here? Maybe she was getting bored at the studio, alone.
