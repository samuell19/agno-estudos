He wants to meet with us Oh, and get this. He wants to meet with us What does he want? He says he has some info in the case, and he's pretty insistent about it, so I think we ought to check it out Why doesn't he just waltz in here and tell us like he usually does Apparently it has something to do with the CYECOM connection and he has to show it to us on his computer Interesting. Let's go This better be good Still got your key? Shut up [Music] [Music] oh my god [Music] Check the door, check the door. Check the door! Damnit Jord, right Freeze, police! Chill out, Jordan.

He told us he had gathered some information on the case Why didn't you have him come down here? The information he wanted us to see was on his computer The information he wanted us to see was on his computer It was the CYECOM stuff he wrote about It was the CYECOM stuff he wrote about I told him not to print it What? What did you say? I said I told him not to print the information about CYECOM I said I told him not to print the information about CYECOM You mean, you knew about the lead prior to the printing?

You have chosen the wrong one I will prepare you for the right path I envy you You will interface with MICA before the day is out I stay and convert the masses It is time You have done well It is time for you to ascend to level 5 You have reached the bridge of your awareness Come to me You are ready for greater things It is time. You are not alone. Find a powerful ally to walk with you [Music] you have to remember that just because it's printed in the newspaper doesn't make it the gospel truth I know, but I know all the people who died How did you know them? They were my friends We couldn't find a common link between the victims. How could you know all of them? Well, CYECOM. We talked on the computer bulletin boards What if the newspaper is right? Unbelievable I'm afraid I'm afraid Have you given any personal Have you given any personal information over the computer your address or information over the computer your address or No information over the computer your address or Okay, then don't worry about it. Keep your door locked and be careful in the computer Alright. I'll get the report. I'll be right back I'm sorry I really am afraid Don't be sorry. He's just frustrated with this case I don't think he buys the CYECOM connection Do you buy it? In light of what you've told us, I might Listen. Here's my card. Has my number on it If you suspect anything, I want you to give me a call I'm here if you need me Thank you You could have been a little more sympathetic What never mind Okay, now look. All we got to do is cross reference to the bulletin board and we got our killer It's not that easy Why not? Do you knowhow many people talk on CYECOM? It's an International Board. It would take forever to interview everyone who's ever logged on and talked to anyone of our victims logged on and talked to anyone of our victims Okay, now. Wait a minute we're on the same team, right? Okay, now. Wait a minute we're on the same team, right? Are we really? I'll put Macey on it. Maybe he'll find something Damn it, Jordan That's why I think it's the best one, Jason I understand your interest in Cyberthoughts. It is truly one of the more intriguing comics. However, I like a series with a bit more spice. If you know what I mean What? Oh, come on. You know I like my comics the way I like my women nasty have you ever read Future Flesh Wars? Of course Yeah well, you can keep all that pseudo-intellectual crap. I mean I'm that pseudo-intellectual crap.

What is your address? This is sick. so then what happened? I'm got scared. I logged off I think those subversive comics are dangerous Not all of them. Some of the comics are good Oh, yeah? Like which ones? We all read Cyberthoughts Who's we? All of us who talked on the fantasy bulletin boards So you discuss this specific comic with everyone on the board? Of course Including the murder victims? Yeah These damn laws are so generic. I don't have any titles These damn laws are so generic. I don't have any titles Do you read any other comics?

He's the Master Intelligence Computer Assimilator Whew, that's deep Yeah, there's also this warrior-like character named Zeiss He's the leader of these half-human half-computer people These people need to get out more You're telling me? Newman said all the victims read it too So what you're saying is that our murderer thinks he's the Zeus guy Zeiss Look at this Oh my god In the comic book, when you reach a new computer level you go into these pods, and you cross your arms in allegiance to MICA, and he transforms you So who's ever reading this comic book may know something about the killer Yeah, but why aren't they coming forward? Well, it's because Phillips was killed Well, it's because Phillips was killed I mean, they're either probably scared, or if I mean, they're either probably scared, or if they're not they just don't want to get they're not they just don't want to get involved involved Well, this writer lives in town.
