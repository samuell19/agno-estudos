(Multicom Jingle) (upbeat jazz music) - A horseman? - Joey loved horses. He could do anything on a horse. - I got a call from a senior official in the Premier's office. They're demanding to know who's responsible. - You're wrong about him. - I thought there was hope for you, but you're as crazy as everybody else around here. Stop living in a fantasy, Jake. Jake! - The BBC bought the show, our show. For their Sunday night armchair theater, prime time. - Yes! Let me pick you up at the theater and take you to dinner after the play. - I'm going with someone. - Who? - Is it your affair? - (chuckles) Excellent. Excellent. The subject is not closed between us, Mr. Hersh. - Out. - Good day to you. - Did my cousin Joey really do what you say he did? - Sir, it-- - Did he really trick your friend out of 3,000 pounds? - Well, 700 pounds. - You're a rogue, Harry. - (chuckles) What's this? - What? Oh, it's Joey's saddle, can you believe it? Harry's girlfriend had it. - You mean you paid that despicable little man? - I paid her, I paid her. - Oh, oh. - Oh. Oh, okay, okay, yes, yes. - I think we should go. (moody orchestral music) (baby cries) (peaceful orchestral music) - Hey. He's perfect. Bye, Sammy. I think he waved. - I am so exhausted, Jake. - Shh. - It's no use you staying here, I'm gonna sleep for days. Why don't you call Luke? - Luke, what, to tell him about Sam? - Of course, he'll be thrilled. - Do you think he even remembers who I am? - Don't be such a boor. I'm sure he misses you just as much as you miss him. - Who said I miss him? Nancy. (sighs) (phone rings) - Mr. Scott's residence. - Who is this? - [Man] This is Mr. Scott's assistant. To whom am I speaking? - Tell Luke it's Jake and I would like to invite him to lunch to celebrate the birth of my firstborn son. - [Assistant] Mr. Scott is in America at present. And your last name, sir? - He'll remember who I am, thanks. (chuckles) Eshcel. Eschel! I'm a father! - Yep. - I'm a father and I feel good, I feel good. Don't you ever feel good? - Yeah, on occasion, yeah. But I must admit, I feel bemused. - Bemused? - That you would choose to celebrate this blessed day with me. As I said, I am bemused. - Harry, I thought we were friends now. - Why would you want to be friends with me? - As I said, don't sell yourself short, because despite everything you have done, everything, there is something refreshingly honest about you. - But I'm not honest, Jake. No, and you know that (chuckles) as well as I do. No, you've not sought me out for my honesty. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - Why have I sought you out, then? - Courage. You see in me a man who has the courage to take action, and you are a man what is fascinated by men of action. Even when, as in my case, you see in the service of foolish impulses. And I dare say that your admiration for that ne'er-do-well cousin of yours, Joey, stems from the exact same roots. Hm, am I wrong? - He's not a ne'er-do-well, but no, you're not wrong. It's actually quite insightful. - Oh, thanks, yeah, you seem surprised. - A little, a little. - I'm fascinating to you because I have no fear, and I feel no guilt. And look at you, you hardly believe that's possible. Isn't that right? - You surprise me, Harry. - Can I have a loan of 30 quid? (Jake chuckles) - That's another surprise, what for? - Well, first, the money. - 30 pounds. - Yeah. - What's that? - Verve Cliqo. (chuckles) (glass clinks) Excuse me, my friend and I are celebrating the birth of his newborn son and heir. (men applaud) (Jake sighs) - Thank you. - You're welcome. - See, I never could've done that. - Exactly. Cheers. Thanks. (peaceful piano music) - Do you like it? - It's perfect. - [Jake] We've got it for a whole month. - [Nancy] Thank you, Jake. - Wanna go to the dock? - Yeah, how did you get it? - Ah, it's a secret. - No, you must tell me! You must tell me. Can't you stay at least a week, Jake? You need a vacation more than I do. It would be so nice to be together. - I wish I could, I've got all meetings all week long. Besides, I gotta break down that thing for the BBC. - You'll be so lonely in that house all by yourself. - (chuckles) I've got plenty to do to keep me busy. And I will come up here every Friday night. (peaceful piano music) You just take care of yourself and Sammy. (Nancy chuckles) (sighs) (phone rings) - Yeah. - [Jake] Eschel! - What is it, Jacob? - I'm taking you to a party. All of swinging London, are you game? - And why do I merit this honor? - Harry, did it ever occur to you that maybe I don't wanna go alone, that maybe I actually wanna go with someone that I consider to be a friend? - Uh, well, what shall I wear? - Anything, as long as you got dark glasses. (upbeat music) How are ya? Supposedly there's a Beatle coming. - Oh, which one? - I don't know. You see who you're next to? - Yeah, what about him? - He once lit a cigarette for Jackie Kennedy. Let's what we can find, come on, come on. Look at that. - Whoa. Those people were-- - I know. - Oh. - [Woman] Jake? How are you? - Good, how are you? - Maddy. I had a couple of sides in the Christmas caper last year. You were such a wonderful director. (Jake chuckles) Oh, these are my friends, Adula and Henri. - It's so wonderful to meet you. - Wonderful. - Ladies, follow me. I'd like you to meet someone. This here is Stein, Stein. - What? - This here is a man who's going to be making pictures. - You're new, Mr. Stein. - Have you got anyone to take you round the clubs Mr. Stein? - No, I don't really go to clubs, usually. - Yeah. - Well, yeah. No, clubs, yes, of course I, all sorts of clubs. Very private clubs. Clubs that no one even would go in them. - Really? - Private. - And I thought I knew all the clubs. - Yeah, photography clubs. Yeah. Have you birds ever posed nude for photographers? I'm two bob the hour and I won't pay more than that. - Barbara has been asking for you, sorry, sorry. - Oh, well, you picked a fine time to leave. I was just about to make my move! Hello. - You could've fooled me, 'cause it looked like you were gonna sink through the floor. - Yeah, well, listen, I had a bitch all picked out! Yeah, but how could I ask one back to my place, hm? - Harry, those girls were ready to service you like a pit crew around a race car. What's the business with taking photographs? - Listen, you've got your predilections and I've got mine. - Right, we'll go back to my place for a night cap. - Oh, yeah, well that would get me home just in time to shave before going back to the office, that'd be nice-- - Fine, you can stay over, you can stay over. - Oh, yeah, the maid's quarters are free this week, is it? - Skip it, Harry, I did what I could to get you laid, but I guess in your world, no good deed goes unpunished. I'll drop you off. - Oh, come on, mate. (toilet flushes) (phone rings) (phone rings) - Hello? - Jacob! It's your Uncle Abe. I got some bad news for you. - My father die? - He passed away earlier today. - I see. - You should come to the funeral, it's tomorrow morning. - I'll catch the first flight out, Abe. Thank you. (melancholic orchestral music) (phone rings) - Oh, hello? - Nancy. - Jake! Does this mean you're coming out early? We both miss you so much. - My father died. Uncle Abe just called. - Oh, Jake. - I'm gonna call you from Montreal. - Is there anything I can do? Do you want me to come? - No, no, God no, you stay safe with Sammy. I'm gonna have to sit shiva, it's expected, so. - I don't understand, what's shiva? - Oh, the entire family sits inside for a week as a sign of mourning. Oh, god. (chuckles) A week inside with my family? You know what, there might be more than one funeral. (Nancy chuckles) - I love you. Sammy loves you. (kisses) - I'll be thinking of you both every minute. Bye. - Bye. (sighs) (Jake sighs) (phone rings) - Hello. - Jacob, you're up already. I hope it's not too early. - I'm leaving for Montreal, Harry, my father has died. - Oh, well, my condolences. Well advanced in years, I imagine. - What do you want, Har? - Well, I was calling to apologize, for my bad behavior, actually. It was quite, quite uncalled for. - It's fine, it's fine. - Well, I've had a thought. Given your absence and your wife's being in Cornwall, would you like me to house-sit the family castle, like? - What scheme have you hatched, Harry? - What? No scheme, (chuckles) I offer to do a favor, that's all. Just look after things, you know, perhaps I take advantage to the extent of having a bird in. You know, as I said, shame to have one back at my place. See, it's not so nefarious, is it? - All right, fine, Harry, leave everything as you found it. The key will be under the mat. - Yeah, all right. Thanks, mate, all right, have a great, you know, trip. (moody orchestral music) - This is ridiculous. - An hour and a half ago. - [Woman] He's probably having a drink somewhere. - Well, what do you expect? - How could he? At a time like this. Everyone's here, the Rabbi wants to start. - Yeah, we'll give him five more minutes. - You are late for your own father's funeral? Everybody's waiting for you. - I came straight from the airport. It's good to see you, too. Where's Ma, is she here? - She didn't wanna upstage Fanny. - Is that the girlfriend? - Mm-hm. - Well, I'll see her before the shiva. - It's at Uncle Abe's. - Where else? - This a good tie? - Yes. - Orthodox, shows you're morning, let's go. (Jake sighs) - It's sad the way he died. - What way, Ma? - In the arms of a kurvo slut, who opened up her legs to him without the blessing of holy matrimony. - Ma, do you have anything to drink? - At lunch, you drink? - It's the occasion, Ma. - Jake, your father was not to blame that he was not intelligent enough for me. I'm sure he would've made a good husband for a simple woman. And my baby, how is he? - Nancy's baby's fine, Ma. (moody piano music) (chatter in foreign language) (phone rings) - Hello. Of course. Jake. It's for you. - Who is it? - The boss. - Are you all right? - [Man] So, you sell that old clunker yet? - [Jake] I'm fine, I'm fine. - You don't have to pretend, Jake. - No, really, really, I'm having a wonderful time. - [Man] Who does she think she is? I'll tell you one thing, Marilyn Monroe she's not. (Jake sighs) - [Woman] Who does she think she is at her age? - You know, it's all right to let yourself grieve. - We all grieve in our own way, huh? I love you. - I love you, too. - Anybody seen Yosel? - He's on the stoop, smoking a stogie. - Uncle Abe. You remember the last time my cousin Joey was in Montreal? - Of course I do, what about him? - You turned him in, didn't you? - What are you talking about? You're drunk. - Just give me a straight answer. - Here it is, then. (slap) - You come here to sit shiva for your own father, and you booze from morning till night and stir up trouble. Who needs you anyway? - No, you're right, why am I sitting shiva? I don't believe in it. What, am I trying to please all of you anyway? - Out of respect for your father. - I never respected my father. - Do you hear? Do you hear him? - But I loved him. - He's not dead a week and you don't respect him? Rotten thing, animal. The day you married that shiksa, you broke his heart! - It's okay. - I shouldn't have slapped you. Forgive me, Jake. - You bloody well shouldn't have slapped me. You should've given me a straight answer to my question. - Can't you accept an apology like a gentleman? - Did you tell them where they could find him? Did you? - [Abe] Come with me. You think the world of your cousin, is that right? - You put the French goons onto him, after the trouble at the palet door. Admit it, you betrayed him. - I wish I had. - Are you denying it? - I could've done it without batting an eyelash. But I didn't. - God's name, why? - You have no idea how close we were to a race riot here. - But he didn't start the fight. He just wanted to go inside. - Wino till the end! - I was there, I saw it happen. Oh, god. I didn't go to help him when they attacked him. But I was there. The kid who got hurt, he tripped and he hit his head. It wasn't Joey. - Why have you never said this before? - Because I should've stepped up and fought at his side. And now my father's dead and he doesn't have to know didn't. - He still instigated the whole thing, and you did the right thing because you're a good Jewish boy. - Don't claim me! The entire Hersh honor rests on Joey's back, not your complacent shoulders. And yes, I'm loyal, to the end. - Putz. Let me ask you this, since I'm the villain in your books. What's Joey ever done for you? Or for Hannah or Jenny, his own family? Me, I took them in when they were in rags. - Oh, what's the use, Abe? - Yanko, yanko, let's something straight here. We're talking about a blackmailer, a gambler. A small-time crook, a man who moves from country to country with assumed names, certainly with a good reason. - Yes, with good reason, he's hunting Nazis! (Abe speaks foreign language) - Okay, Joey's (speaks foreign language). A one-man macabee band. He's searching the jungles for Mengele. And if he finds him, what then? - He captures him or he kills him. Like, uh, (speaks foreign language). - From what I know of your cousin, if he is hunting this Nazi down and finds him, he won't kill him, he'll blackmail him! (somber piano music) (phone rings) (phone rings) - Hello. - Hey, Jenny, it's Jake. I'm on Montreal. - I'm sorry about your dad. - [Jake] Yeah. - So, are you sitting shiva with all the hypocrites? - I need to speak to Hannah, is she there? - Yep, one second. It's Jake. He's calling from Montreal. (Hannah speaks foreign language) - Hannah, how are you? - I'm sorry about your father. We were never what you would call friendly, but he was your pa and I'm sorry. - Have you heard from Joey lately? - [Hannah] Got a postcard about three months ago. - What's he doing, do you know? - Oh, he never tells me anything, he says he's fine, asks if we're fine. - Do you where it's from? - Uruguay? Paraguay? I don't know, I get those places mixed up. - Paraguay, it was probably Paraguay. - Why are you asking? - Because that's where Mengele is. - [Hannah] What? - It's okay. Just wanted to know if he's all right. (sighs) (upbeat funk music) (upbeat rock and roll music) - Uh, excuse me. I don't even know quite how to put this, because most likely you won't believe me. - That is right, yah. - Listen, listen. - Hey, no, you not invited. - It's all right, listen, I saw you sitting here. Just like a vision and as it happens, I am a film director. - "Jacob Hersh," sorry, I don't know. - Well, here, take a quite look at this. - So, so you made it, this TV show? - That is what I'm here to tell you, yeah. (woman chuckles) I need to just do one quick thing, okay? Just check one thing, it's a light meter, don't be afraid. - Oh. - You're an actress. - No. (chuckles) - Yeah. - So, you can make actress of me? - I can't promise anything, of course. I mean, your English is not bad. No, it's quite charming, in fact. But I would need you to read a few lines for me. Just like a wee bit of an audition. Would you be up for that? - Why not, yeah. - Shall we? - Yeah! - Yeah! The particular role that I have in mind does involve some tasteful nudity. So, uh, I will need to take some photographs. You know, to show my producers. So I trust that you have no qualms in, uh, in that area, hm? - Who's in the house? - No one's in the house. Just you and me, my house. Oh. (chuckles) Yeah. (woman chuckles) - [Woman] Oh! (laughs) - Yeah. (woman chuckles) - So? - So... - So? Now you? (chuckles) - What? - Now you. - No, no, not me. No, no, you're the one that we're taking the snaps of. - Before we take the pictures, we relax, yah? - Yeah, well this isn't very, listen. - [Woman] Yah. - Maybe we could have a bit of a drink and a chat first? - Oh, boring! I don't want to chat. (chuckles) Oh. (chuckles) - What're you doing now? Yeah, that's my-- (woman laughs) Okay. Right, right. Listen. - Uh... What is the matter? - Nothing's the matter, what? - Oh, you are homo? - No, I most certainly am not, no. - Then, then why are you not, (chuckles) ready? - 'Cause I just didn't expect things to go like this, that's why! - Oh! Oh, this is not the way you like? - Well, you know. - You want to do it in the ass, that's what make you hard. - Yes, please, up you get, up you get. My god, woman, please calm down. Let's just try to bring it down a few notches, all right? You know, I just need to get into the mood a bit that's all. - You English. I first must be drunk for fucking. (Harry chuckles) - Yeah. - [Driver] Right, thank you. - Shit. Henry. - Yes? - [Jake] Hello. What're you doing here? - I am guest of Hersh. - My name is Hersh, this is my house. (woman laughs) Where's Harry? - Harry? (laughs) Who is Harry? Please, I don't know Harry. - [Jake] (chuckles) What did he tell you his name was? - I tell you already, Hersh! Jacob. I see his paper, yah? - Harry! - Harry. (laughs) - Oh, Christ! Will you put something on? - You said you weren't gonna be home till tomorrow. - I changed my mind. - [Woman] Yoo-hoo! (giggles) - I told her that I was in films, I said I was a director. Please don't ruin it for me, please. If you want her, mate, go ahead, be my guest. She's crazy for it any way you like, believe me. - Right now, Fellini, I'm crazy for one thing. A drink. - All right. - I'm going to sleep, I want you both gone by tomorrow. - Gone. (both chuckle) (snores) - Harry! - [Harry] Oi, hey! - Who said you could touch this? - Ah, come on, I didn't think you'd mind. I just, I used it in some photographs, very very arty. - You disgust me, get dressed. - Hey, take it easy! We can discuss this like civilized gentlemen. - Civilized? - Yeah. - Oh, god, how old is she? - Old enough. - Listen, mate, you need to relax, all right? You need to calm down, all right? Listen, have a drink and have a giggle. Hey, look at her, mate, she wants it, mate. Anywhere you like, yours for the taking. - Your brother doesn't like me. - Oh, he's not my brother. - "Just for pictures." - All right, now don't you give no false impressions now. I gave you what you wanted, right in the backside. - Oh, Jesus. - It takes an hour before you're even hard. Then you finish, one second. Poof! (chuckles) Even before you put it in. There is only empty balloon. - Poof? Is that why you panicked at the party, Harry? Because you can't get it up, you just like to watch? Is that the thing? - Don't be ridiculous. I was exhausted from all the boinky boinky. It's a wonder she's not. - Maybe you don't like me with your head. But you like me here, yah? Oh, yes. Not like him. - Do it, Jake. - You're German, right? Yeah. Were you with the Hitler Youth? - How could I? I am born too late. (groans) My brother was in Hitler Youth, it was all nonsense! My father saved the Jews in the war. - Oh, your father saved Jews. (chuckles) Is that what you're doing here, you're saving Jews? - Who is Jew? - I'm a Jew, he's a Jew. - No. - Or maybe he didn't tell you that. You forgot to tell her, Harry? - I don't think you are Jew. You don't look, you know. Maybe him. - Hey. - Get her out now. - Hey, no, mate. You know what, no, you're making a big mistake. - Get out of my house, get out! - All right, all right! - Get out! - [Harry] All right, all right! - [Woman] You frighten me. - Please get dressed and leave. - So you are the film director? Not him? - Just get out. - [Woman] This is not fine. Jewish. Jewish bastards. - [Officer] Hold on now, what's this? Looks like she might be secreting some illegal drugs about her person. - [Officer] Let the poor thing drag herself home and sleep it off. (woman mutters in German) - Are you all right, miss? - I don't know this, what you call, right. (speaks German) English! I don't call it right what they did. - Step into the car, won't you, miss? And we'll see you get home safe. It isn't right what who did? - They, they both have the same name. Hersh. - Hersh, are you saying, are you quite sure? - Or, or Stein. I know these names, don't I? They are both good German names. But they, they're Jews, these two, not Germans. - Would we be speaking about the house there? - Yeah, yeah, that is the house where they keep me! - You see, you've got to develop an instinct for these things, Patrolman Emmett. - I can go home now to my employers? - Your employers? You are an au-pair girl, are you? - Yeah! - And your age, you're not yet 21, are you? - Exactly so, I am nine years old. Teen. Teen years. Nine. - 19, isn't that a lovely innocent age? - Mr. Jacob Hersh? - Yes? Thank you. Thanks, Bernstein, you did a good job in there. - Arranging your bail was a very simply matter, Jake, and the going gets much harder from this point forward. - Yeah? - We're solicitors. We have no practice before the criminal ball. You need a specializing barrister to represent you at trial. - Trial? - Yes, Jake, there's going to be a trial. - Like a public trial? - I'm afraid so. I can offer you to Snappen, he is brilliant with juries. - Bernstein, don't take this the wrong way. I don't wanna be defended by a Jew. - What the hell is that supposed to mean? - What English jury is gonna believe a Jew defended by a Jew? Come on, Bernstein, you know what I'm talkin' about. I don't want some twisty eloquent point-scorer, who's gonna outwit the judge and the prosecutor, and chew up the witnesses and alienate the jury, and land me in jail for the rest of my life. - I see. - I'm scared, can't you tell that? I am terrified and I need help and I need someone that the jury can relate to, someone that they'll listen to when he says what Harry and what I didn't do. I need an Englishman, because they will believe every word he says and you know that I'm right. - My friend, Freddy Ormsby-Fletcher might be what you're looking for. He's a very steady sort, very respectable. - Perfect. - But he's very much in demand. I'm not sure he'll take your case. - Well, let's call him up, I'll pay him anything he wants. - It's not about the money, Jake. It's about how he sees your case and how he sees you. - [Jake] Mr. Ormsby-Fletcher, Freddy. - Ah, I'm delighted to meet you, Mr. Hersh. I'm a great admirer of your work. Pamela and I watch all of your television shows. - Really? That's, that's just wonderful. I'm grateful that you could meet me on such short notice. - Well, you said it was an emergency. I take it you are facing felony charges of some kind. - I'm absolutely innocent of all the charges. - Of course. - You come very highly recommended, Freddy. I know I could use your help. - Tim Bernstein is an excellent solicitor and a friend. Now, why don't you tell me all about it, and we'll see if I'm the proper chap for you. - Oh, I've no doubt you're the proper chap for me. - Well, be sure, we will do our very best. - I'm utterly assured. I can feel my upper-lip stiffening already. What are we drinking? - That is a '58 Cotes du Rhone. It's a serious wine and appropriately so for a serious chat, don't you think? - Perfect, absolutely perfectly appropriate. Nancy! Darling. Let me take Sammy and I wanna show you something. (chuckles) Hello. Huh? Look what I bought for you, your favorites, and quail eggs and ceviche, from Harrods. - I'm gonna make myself a drink. - Good, good, you go do that. I'm gonna go put Sammy to bed. Hello. Okay. - And that's the truth? - [Jake] Nancy, you know me. I would sooner die than lie to you. - Oh, my god. Oh, my god, my god. What are we gonna do? - [Jake] I already have a lawyer. A very good chap. - A chap? (laughs) - He's an English fellow, as it happens. My solicitor Bernstein recommended him. He specializes in cases like this. - What kind of cases would that be? - Nancy, we can get through this, like we get through everything, together. - Together? - Yeah. - Together. Were we together last night? Oh, no, wait, it was your dear friend Harry and that child that you were together with. Not me, I was in Cornwall with your infant son, wishing you were with us. - For God sakes, please, do we have to do this? - Together. Why should we go through this together, Jake? Give me one good reason. Can you do that? - Because I love you and I would never betray you. And I didn't and you know that. Surely you know that, Nancy. - Do you have any idea what this is gonna be like, when the press gets hold of it? - Oh, god, the press. - You fool, Jake. You bloody fool. - Mr. Stein? You are charged with sodomy, rape, and the possession of cannabis, how do you plead? - Not guilty, your honor. - Mr. Hersh. You are charged with rape, aiding and abetting sodomy, and the possession of cannabis, how do you plead? - Nancy, I'm innocent of the charges! I swear on the head of our child! - Don't you ever hold Sammy hostage to this, ever! - I'm sorry, I'm gonna go downstairs. - Why is that disgusting pig of a man your friend? I mean, what do you see in him? - He's not my friend, anymore. - Well, why was he ever, I mean, why did you invite him into our life? - I don't know, I guess I found him fascinating. (Nancy sighs) See, Nance, all I am is the sum of my fears. Even when I'm sleeping, I dream of Nazis crashing through the window and I'm unable to do anything. Because, because I'm not Joey. Hell, I'm not even Harry. I just wanted to understand it, that's all. - And do you? - No. - Well, I do. It's no great mystery. It's because you're sane, more or less, and Harry Stein is a psychopath. He doesn't care what people think because he's insane. And you're probably just as mistaken about your cousin, the hero. - Let's leave Joey out of this, shall we? - No, let's not leave Joey out of this, Jake. That is your problem, you cannot leave Joey out of anything! And because of your fixation with your horseman, you have let Harry Stein drag you around, as if you have a ring through your nose. - Joey has nothing to do with Harry. I don't appreciate you lumping the two of them together. (melancholic music) - It's not me that's lumped them together, Jake. - [Ma] You'll never believe who I sat beside on the flight. - Let me guess-- - An Indian woman from India. Not the yellow knife kind. Anyway, we sit for an hour, we don't say a word. Finally, I can't take it anymore, so I say to her, "what's that for, the dot on the head?" The dot means she's married, how about that? Here, you've got a diamond on the finger. There, they've got a dot on the head. Personally, I'll take the diamond. Even though your father, that cheap, never mind. Anyway, anyway, you know what else she tells me? In India, they got respect for the mother. They all live together in one big house, and guess who's the head of the house. - I don't know. - Guess who's the head of the house. - Mom, I have no idea. - Just guess, guess! (Jake sighs) - Psst. Hey. Sleeping, you sleeping? Did you remind her to take her medicine? - I didn't realize it was my job to remind her. - Nancy, come on, women her age get strokes. Like that, boom. And heart trouble does run in the family. Don't forget, come on. - Well, I'm glad to see you have some feelings for her after all. - You have to watch her like a hawk, you understand? All I need is for her to be with us for years. Bed-ridden. - Jake! - What? - Goodnight. (suspenseful music) (guns fire) (men yell) (horse neighs) (guns fire) (moans) Jake, you're sweating. - I'm okay. The horseman was riding to save us. He was galloping down the street. Couldn't get there in time, there was nothing I can do. Just like always. - I'm gonna get you a sleeping pill. - No, no, no, no, I can't be groggy at court tomorrow. I gotta be sharp. - You have to try and get some sleep. - No, I've slept enough. - It's all right, Jake. I understand. - All I could think about is Nazis crashing through the windows. (sighs) Except they're London bobbies, and lawyers, and judges with the fake wigs and black robes. But they're gonna drag me away. Oh, god. My life's slipping through my fingers. - Nobody's gonna drag you away, Jake, have faith. - You know what? I'm terrified. I am, and I'm just, I'm losing control. - I understand that you're terrified, I do, but I don't understand why, not when you're innocent. - You believe me. I'm finished if you don't believe me. - Try and get some sleep. - Morning, George. You seen the papers? - No, sir. - Sure you have, how could you have missed it? - I'm sure the girl's lying, sir! You're just not the type. - Neither was Jack the Ripper. - This one needs signature, Mr. Hersh. - Oh, shit, Inland Revenue. - Bad news, Mr. Hersh? - Bad news? How could a registered letter from the taxman possibly be bad news? Bye, George. - Bye, sir. - So, you're pleased I've come to stay with you? It's a help, isn't it? - Yeah, Ma. - Well, that's good, because Sammy is adorable. He should know his grandmother. Yes, he should. Yes, he should. - Sammy needs his beauty sleep, excuse us. - I've been here nearly two days. You haven't even told me how I look to you. Don't you think I carry my years well? Don't you think I look young for my age? - Ma, I don't even know your age, your age is the best-kept secret since the formula for Coca Cola. - Everybody thinks so, everybody. Dr. Burkowitz, he adores me. I went in for my breast examination and he was amazed. He was simply amazed. "I don't believe it, at your age, such breasts!" And he's a doctor, you know. - Yeah, Ma, he's a breast man. - The lawyers, they'll cost you plenty. - Oh, nothing doing, he's still hungry. Will you pour me a coffee, darling? - What, you should coffee while you're nursing? - Ma, will you just please? - That's got nothing to do with it. Ow, darn it, Sammy. - Jake was a biter, such a biter. I used to have teeth marks all around my nipples. (chuckles) But he doesn't remember, do you? - I remember, Ma, I remember every bite. Just gonna have a coffee in the next room, excuse me. - Jake says I carry my years very well. He says I look very young for my age. But maybe he was just flattering? I could take the baby for you, if it's too much of a burden. - [Nancy] No, I'm fine, thank you, Mrs. Hersh. - [Ma] Mrs. Hersh? Please call me Ma. Like Jake does, that's what I'm used to. - [Nancy] But Jake's your son, Mrs. Hersh. I'll call you Sarah, all right? - [Sarah] If that makes you happy. Please be careful, be careful. You don't know what it is to be a mother. Such agony. - [Nancy] I have a child, Mrs... Sarah. And if Jake goes to prison-- - [Sarah] You mustn't even think that! - [Nancy] Well, I have to think that. - [Sarah] I wouldn't go home, you know. I'd stay right here and I'd stick by you for as long as I was needed. You married into a Jewish family. And in a crisis, we always stick together. (Nancy speaks foreign language) - "Nipple biter." So, here you are. (Jake sighs) - You ever wish that you'd married Luke? - No. But it's not too late. I mean, I'm still young enough to start another family. - I'm not kidding. (Nancy chuckles) - I am. You're my man, like it or lump it. - (sighs) Nance, I don't think I can handle her being here. Not on top of everything else. - Let me come to court with you today. - Absolutely not. - It's your first day of trial. I think the jury should see that you have a loving wife. - I couldn't bear it, and I'd probably lose what little composure I have left. - Are you crying? - Allergies, Ma. - Allergies? Oh, now it's allergies. - Well, they just started, after you arrived. - Hm, I think it's all the English food you feed him. Too much pork and bacon. - I'm sure you're right, you must cut back, darling. (Jake sighs) - Good luck in court today. - Thanks, Ma. - That other one, he should rot in hell. - We're in this together, let's not forget. If it goes badly for him, it's not particularly good for me either. Ma! (Nancy chuckles) (Nancy chuckles) (gavel thuds) - Stein came upon Ingrid Lobner, an au-pair girl, in a coffee bar on Finchly Road in Hamstead and tricked her into accompanying him to Hersh's house. He offered her a drink and what she took to be a cigarette but was actually cannabis. He assured her that it would be necessary for her to pose naked for audition pictures. Even so, she would no acquiesce to anything more. Stein became menacing. He brandished a riding crop. He whipped her across the buttocks with it. He produced a saddle and informed her that they would play a game of horsey. (court murmurs) - I'm doomed. - Oh, no, no, no, no. - Oh, yeah. - [Freddy] Shall we go? (phone rings) - Hello? Who is this? Yes, she's here. Who may I say is calling? - Is it for me? - A man. - Could you take him into the kitchen, please? You can give him some mashed banana if you like. - Oh, yes, oh, my baby. - Hello. Luke? Yes, certainly, but I have to be back by five, because he calls as soon as court adjourns. Okay, bye. - Suddenly I'm not too unhygienic to feed my own grandson. Hm? Somebody's tired! (chuckles) - Sarah? - Mm-hm? - Would you mind looking after Sammy for a couple of hours? - You're going out? - Or so it seems. - What do I tell Jake if he phones? - I don't know, tell him I've gone to Forrest Smith Spa for a colonic irrigation. (chuckles) I have to get some air, Mrs. Hersh, I need it. - Oh. - Thank you. - I don't know. Aw, yes, yes, yes, sleepy, sleepy! (peaceful piano music) - Hey. (Nancy chuckles) So, how's it going so far? - Oh, let's not talk about it yet. How are you? - Ah, exhausted. Just got back from Canada. Press tour of the latest blockbuster. (chuckles) - How was Canada? - Oh, as exciting as ever. All our old friends in Toronto asking about Jake's trouble. Oozing sympathy but at the same time hungering for dirt. You know how it goes, ah-ah, we're talking about it. I'm sorry. - I'm glad you called. - Oh, I'm glad you're glad. I really wanted to see you, you know? And see how you're doing, how Jake's really doing. - You'll hardly know him anymore, Luke. - We were like brothers once, you know? (sighs) Shit, I miss him, but... Should I call, should I just drop by unannounced? (Nancy laughs) - I wish I could say yes, but I just think him seeing you and being confronted by all your success, I don't think it's a good idea. I don't think it's gonna help him. - My success, my wonderful success. (chuckles) - You sound bitter. - I wish I'd found someone, Nancy. Like Jake found you. - Well, you still can. - Oh, I don't know, I don't think so. No, I think from here on out, it's tabloid romances, quickie Hollywood weddings, quicker Las Vegas divorces. (both laugh) I'm a certified member of the International Glitterati now, don't you know? (chuckles) I'm not complaining, it comes with the territory. (sighs) I wish I'd fought for ya. The way that Jake did. It was life or death for him and he knew it. (sighs) It was life or death for me too, only I didn't know it. - I have no regrets, Luke. - I guess that's all I needed to hear. - And are you hearing it? - I won't mention it again, I promise you. (sighs) (sighs) Hey, everything's gonna be all right. - Please, Luke, no platitudes. Not from you. (chuckles) Oh, fuck. (Sarah speaks foreign language) - Was the baby any trouble? - How could he be any trouble? He's my precious little darling, I live only for him. - I love him too, Mrs. Hersh. But I certainly do not live only for him. - I'm feeling a little dizzy, it must be the hot flashes. I'm going to lie down. (Nancy sighs) - [Lawyer] You were naked when Hersh arrived at the house? - Yes. - Why? - Because he has hidden my clothes. - [Lawyer] Who? - Stein. He, he forces me. He warns me. Hersh was very important. He says, he says Hersh could make me a star. But, but he must see what I look like naked. He says I must please Hersh or they will be both be very, very angry with me. - And you were willing? - But he has hidden my clothes! He has, he has a whip in his hand. He hits me with it, on my bottom. I think I must do what he wants, so he won't hurt me again. - Did Stein say anything to Hersh when he first arrived? - He says, "do you want her now?" "She's crazy for it, all ways." - I believe we will adjourn at this point, and resume with Miss Lobner tomorrow. - Well, well, well. (chuckles) Well, now we'll see, hm? Now we'll see what sort of friend you are. - Define friend, Harry. Is what you've done to me an act of friendship? - I'm a man of action, mate. If sometimes a little impulsive. Oh, come on, you can't say I didn't warn you. - You're pathetic, Harry. Pathetic. - Well, you'd be ill-advised to turn on me, mate. 'Cause you're in this up to your neck, just like me. - The hell I am, I walked in on you. I'm a bystander. - A bystander? (chuckles) Listen to him. If it weren't for you, mate, none of this would've happened. - What is this, have you forgotten? Let me remind you, this is anal sex with a minor, Harry. You did that, not me. - I just gave her what she asked for, mate. That's not the problem. If you hadn't eased her out of the house, she never would've gone to the cops and she never would've even had a case. If she'd been allowed to stay the night, as she expected, if she'd had breakfast with us, there's not a magistrate in this land who wouldn't have just laughed her out of court, but no, no, we didn't want her soiling your precious fucking sheets, did we? - Go to hell. - All I've got is this public defender wanker, but if you and your fancy lawyer are thinking of making me the sacrificial lamb, I'll have you in court, mate. I'll do anything I can to see that you get sentenced. Oh. - I'm sure you would. - Oh, you saw that. I've got nothing to lose, mate! You'd best keep that in mind. (Sarah snores) (knocks) - Yes? - Oh, I'm sorry, did I wake you? - Who could sleep at a time like this? - Well, it is only seven o'clock. - Middle of the night in Montreal. - Sarah, you've been here almost a week. Surely you've adjusted. Jake called just now to say he'll be late. - Oh, my god, what's happened now? - Oh, nothing. He and Mr. Ormsby-Fletcher, they have a lot to talk about. They've gone to a pub, they could be very late. Here you are, picked up some kosher salami, and some rye bread for you. Eat it. You didn't have any dinner. - I wasn't hungry. - I had to go to three shops before I could find kosher salami, now you eat it, Mrs. Hersh. - I can't. - I'm gonna sit here and you're gonna eat that sandwich, every last mouthful. Eat it! - I can't. - Eat it! - But you buttered the bread. - What? - It's not kosher. I'm not supposed to eat butter with meat. - Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit. You are not to spy on me. - I didn't see a thing, so help me God. - You were watching by the window, assuming the absolute worst about me, weren't you? - So now I committed the crime? - You are not to say a word to Jake, do you understand? - I understand. Don't you worry. - No, no, you most emphatically do not understand. Not for one moment. Do you actually think Luke is my lover? - Who said the word? - I have hundreds, you know, troops, before and after pregnancy, during, whenever I'm not nursing babies or changing nappies. Whenever Jake's out for lunch, they arrive by the shower bank load and they fuck me black and blue! - That is a word from the gutter! - If you can't have butter on your salami sandwich, how come you can have eggs with your hot dogs? - Eggs are parva. - Sometimes all your Jewish hocus pocus... (sobs) I'm sorry. - Don't you be sorry. Open up the sewer gates, let's hear it all. How did it go today, did he say? - Well, it couldn't have gone very well. Or else he wouldn't be out getting drunk with his lawyer. (Sam cries) Oh, it's the baby crying. (Sarah sighs) - [Lawyer] Did you coerce Miss Lobner or otherwise force her to have sexual relations with you? - "Force her," (chuckles) that's a laugh. No, no, we just had a wee bit of fun, is all. - [Lawyer] Did you commit sodomy upon her person? Was that your idea of fun? - She begged me for it and so, naturally, I just gave her what she craved. As many times as she wanted. Now, I can't recall now if it was four or... Seven times, perhaps. I lost count. What's a gentleman to do, after all? - Could you tell us how Miss Lobner left the house? - Well, as I said, we wanted her to stay and share some breakfast with us. But suddenly, she bolted, said she had to get back to her place before her employer awakened, but would we like to see her again tomorrow night. - She offered to return? - She told us that she hadn't had such a ball since she'd it off with a couple of West Indians. - [Lawyer] Did you conceal her clothes? - No, I did not. She was free to leave anytime that she liked. - That will be all, Your Lordship. - Yep. Hello. (hums jauntily) (Jake sighs) - Jake, I never bug you about your drinking, but please don't pour another. - Luke's in town. - Is he? - Oh, yeah. It's in the Standard. His arrivals, departures, they're news. It's like the Queen Mary. He's become a thing here, Luke. A cultural artifact. - Is there something we need to talk about? - Ma. Did you take your pills today, Ma? - I was a good little girl. - Your mother and I had words. - It was nothing, a little misunderstanding. Let's not upset Jake. - Why not upset Jake? I met Luke for drinks today. - You met Luke for drinks today? - Well, he called, he wanted to get together with you. - I see, what did you tell him? - That the time isn't right. - No, no, it's not right. I don't need pity now from Mr. Hollywood. - Well, funny as it may seem, I think he needs you more than you need him. I don't think he has any real friends anymore. - Aw, poor baby. - Anyway, I broke down. He dropped me off outside and your mother saw him kiss me, and she thinks we're having an affair, which is why I asked her not to say anything to you. - Did I say a word? I didn't say a word! - Would you please explain to her that the reason you are jealous of Luke is not because of anything between us, but because he is so successful? - Enough, I'm not on trial here. I'm on trial there. - You know what? Why don't the two of you sit in the kitchen, and eat something "parva" together? - You see? You marry a shiksa, you see what happens? (Jakes sighs) (moody piano music) (Nancy sobs) - I don't bully old ladies or say "fuck" to them. I made such a fool of myself today. - Hey, hey. Try to get some sleep, all right? - Do you want to go to prison? - Do you think I've lost my mind? - I worry you've lost your courage. - There's moments. There's moments today I wanted to sink through the floor into the ancient dungeons below. - You know, Luke said something about you today. - That you never should've married me? That's it not too late to jump aboard the Hollywood Express? - That I was a matter of life and death for you. And that you fought. You fought for me. - Yeah. - When something really matters to you, you are a fighter. You are ferocious, every bit as much as your cousin. Fight, Jake, fight now. Don't let Harry Stein drag you down. - Mr. Hersh, were you expected at your home on the night of June the 12th? - No, I was supposed to arrive the following day. - And what happened when you arrived at your house? - I seemed to have taken Stein and Miss Lobner by surprise. - [Lawyer] What was she wearing? - She was nude. - And this didn't embarrass her? (chuckles) - Far from it. (chuckles) - And then what did you do? - I went upstairs and I went to bed. - [Lawyer] And when did you encounter her again? - I awoke at four AM and then I went downstairs. - And what happened then? - Harry tried to interest me in having sex with her. I refused. - And what happened next? - Well, she was insulted. So, we argued and I had had enough. I demanded that she leave my house immediately. - Did you handle her roughly? - Not at all. I didn't touch her. - And what happened then? - She said to me, "I'll fix you for this. "You Jew bastard." Oh, god, they're skinning me alive. I am so insulted, I've never been this profoundly insulted. - It's almost over. - The lies. Everybody's lying. The barristers, Harry, Ingrid, me, everybody's lying! (chuckles) It's incredible. - Jake, are you lying to me, too? - See, this is the worst thing. That you may never trust me again, and there's nothing I can do about it. - You didn't do anything with her, really? - Nothing, as God as my witness. - You don't believe in God. - True, but you said I can't swear on Sammy's head, and I would, bring him in here right now. - All right, that won't be necessary. - I believe in Joey, I'll swear on his life. - No, subject closed. For good. - Members of the jury, are you agreed on your verdict? - We are. - You say you find the prisoner Harry Stein guilty, and is that the verdict of you all? - Yes, it is the verdict of us all. - Prisoner at the bar, you stand convicted of the act of sodomy and rape against Miss Ingrid Lobner. (somber piano music) Members of the jury, do you find the prisoner, Jacob Hersh, guilty or not guilty of possession of cannabis? - Not guilty. - And do you find him guilty or not guilty of aiding and abetting sodomy? - Not guilty, my lord. - Do you find the prisoner at the bar guilty of indecent assault? - Guilty. - Prisoner at the bar, you stand convicted of indecent assault of Miss Ingrid Lobner. - We will take a short recess. - Well, that could've been much worse, old boy. - Yeah, I know. Thank you, Freddy. - One last hoop to jump through, sentencing. Now, your friend, Luke Scott, has contacted me, and he wants to give character testimony on your behalf. Do you want him to speak for you? - Luke is here? - Absolutely, outside the courtroom now. - No. No, I don't need Luke to speak for me, no. - Now, I strongly advise it, it might mean the difference between you walking out of here a free man and being escorted below, (chuckles) to serve a sentence. - You know, Freddy, a part of me wants to give up, and just go and hide in my shame in a jail cell. - That's not an uncommon reaction, Jake. It is, however, the coward's way out. - Call him. Call him. - Good man. - I've known Jakes for years, since we started our careers together in Toronto. We shared an apartment together, and achieved some success jointly, and our ambition brought us to London, where we continue to share an apartment together, as we pursued our career goals. Jake found success first as a director, and continued to be my steadfast and loyal friend, as I struggled with being an unknown playwright. He is a man of singular good character, a model husband and father, and the most generous of friends. - Thank you. - You've been a confounded fool, Hersh. You're a man with every advantage! Obviously intelligent. And talented. Yet, you stand here today disgraced, through folly and sheer egoism, perhaps. How in God's name could you allow yourself to get involved with such a reprobate? Did you not have eyes to see his pornographic obsessions? Did you not have a brain? If I am not sending you to prison today, which could be a mistake, it is out of pity for your family, not you. I do believe your wife has suffered enough for your folly. You have been a party to some disgusting acts, Hersh. But, I am going to give you a chance. And I hope you've learned a lesson. I am fining you 500 pounds and the costs of the prosecution. It remains to be seen whether I have made a silly mistake. The prisoner is discharged. You are a humbug, Stein. It is your obvious intent to lead a life of sexual perversion and crime, and nothing will deter you or protect the public from you, other than incarceration. I sentence you to seven years imprisonment. (somber orchestral music) (court murmurs) (Jake sighs) - Hey. A messenger just dropped this off, it's a script from Luke. He wants you to read it. - Since when does my opinion matter to the great Canadian dramatist? - He wants you to direct it. (Jake sighs) - Do you think Joey read about the trial? - I don't know, Jake. - Yeah. (chuckles) Not in Paraguay. Oh, god, I couldn't handle the shame of him knowing. - Knowing what? Why are you wallowing in this? It's over, you were found innocent. - (chuckles) Nancy, you don't understand. I was convicted of indecent assault. Can you imagine what Joey must think? He's, he's living in the jungle, he's stalking Mengele for the good of his people, and what's his cousin Jake doing? What am I doing? I'm hosting orgies for Nazi nymphomaniac nannies. - The note says he'd like you to read it. Do you think you could find time for that in your busy day? (Jake sighs) - When you were young, I gave you love and protection. And now that I'm approaching old age, I'm going to need yours, too. - [Jake] I'll do everything I can, Ma. - I know that you'll be there for me, to protect me against illness and old age with everything that money can buy, but it goes deeper than that for me. I'm not stupid, I'm a woman with pride and dignity, and intelligence, isn't that right? - Yeah, Ma. - It goes deeper than money for me. - I understand, Ma. - You have a child, too. You have a child! (melancholic orchestral music) - Ma? Wait. I don't want you to leave like this. - No? Then how should I leave? - Ma. You know what it is? - What, what is? - I can't forget, I can't forgive you. For how you treated Dad. - You think I can forgive myself? I'm a foolish old woman, Jacob, my son. But I was a foolish young woman, too. - [Jake] I love you, Ma. - You'll write? - Yeah, I'll write. I might even call you. - You bring my grandson to see me, maybe? - I promise. (Jake sighs) Luke? I'd like to direct your script. - You mean it? - Think I'm the only one who could possibly salvage it. (Luke and Nancy laugh) - Uh-huh. Well, it's exactly what I was thinking, and that's why I'm so relieved to have your answer. - To a successful new chapter. - Cheers. - Good. (Nancy laughs) (Nancy laughs) (Nancy laughs) - Nancy? - Oh, thank you. - [Jake] Thank you. - Whoa! (laughs) Oh. You, cheeky. - Sammy. - (laughs) Cheeky. I thought you weren't gonna do it, because it was just charity on his part. - Oh, it is just charity on his part. - So, why are you doing it? - (chuckles) Why are you asking? - (laughs) Because I think the answer is important, for both of us to know. - Because I'm fighting for my life. (both laugh) - He's a wriggler. - What did you say you did with the letter from Jenny? - With the mail, in your box in the den. Hey! (laughs) What do you see? (Jake chuckles) (Jake sighs) (melancholic orchestral music) Jake? What is it? - Joey's dead. - Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - He's been dead for nearly three months now. - How did it happen? - It was an air crash. Small plane on a makeshift field in Brazil. A secret flight out of Paraguay. - So, he really was a secret agent? - He was smuggling cigarettes. That's what he did for a living. Apparently it's very big stuff there, American cigarettes. That's what he was. A god damn small-time little hustler, a drifter, taking advantage of poor... (sobs) - Oh, Jake, I'm sorry. (Sam cries) Hello. - I spoke with Hannah today. - Oh? How is she? - Oh, she doesn't believe he's dead. She thinks he got in trouble with the police, and that he staged the crash in order to evade arrest. (chuckles) Just like when he got out of Montreal. - What do you think? (Jake sighs) - That I don't wanna be a confounded fool anymore! (Nancy laughs) (upbeat jazz music)
