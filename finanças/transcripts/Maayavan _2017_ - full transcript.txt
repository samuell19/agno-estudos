'2037 Trichy' (Song from 'Pudhu Pudhu Arthangal') Sir, it is mentioned as Doctor here. Now is that an honor he achieved or is he a medical doctor? The deceased individual is a person of very high stature. His name was recommended for the prestigious Presidential award. So, ensure his name carries all the necessary honors for everyone to know. Sir, there are too many degrees mentioned here. So shall I mention everything or just mention 'Doctor' alone? Yes sir. Haven't I mentioned everything clearly? Yes sir. - So mention as it is. - Ok sir. Now leave. Madam, who is he? His gym trainer. He has been with him, day and night, for the past six months. 'Sundeep Kishan' 'Lavanya Tripathi' You fool! Useless! Look what you did to my shop?! You have made it a habit! I curse you! Look at him, such an ugly face! 'Jackie Shroff' You fool! Move! Rocky, now take a right. Enough Rocky. Hey, why are you...? Sir! You monkey! Now come back! She just can't obey! 'Maayavan' 'After three months...' - Good morning mam. - Please come. - Good morning. - Good morning. How are you? I am fine. Let me have a look. I'll take care of it dad. You don't worry. Hope everything is correct in the discharge summary? Yes. How much is the bill amount? - Come on. I'll pay it. - Ok sir. Mom, ensure everything is packed. I'll wait downstairs. Why do you want to stress yourself? Your dad will take care of it. How about a game of Rummy? Come on dad. Quiet now. I'm broke and can't bet. Kumara. What do you prefer? Mutton Rasam or pepper Rasam. Thank you sir. Have a seat Kumaran. Yes, tell me. Sir, I plan on joining back in the force immediately. Bored of resting at home? It's good that you are joining back. Thank you sir. A clearance report must be presented. For the records. Get done with the tests tomorrow and you may resume duty day after tomorrow. Ok? What tests are you talking about? I didn't receive any such intimation. Not many know about this. See, If it was just an accident... then all you had to clear was just a fitness test. But in near to death cases or traumatic experiences, such as yours,... a psychiatrist test must also be cleared. Sir, its been four months now. Only after the doctor said that I am completely fine, I... No...no Kumaran... it is just a formality. Everyone knows that you are completely alright. Like I said, its just a formality. Please do it. Ok sir. 'Psychiatric room' Her husband is troublesome person! This has already happened 2 At least after that she should have warned him. It's evident that her husband is stupid But what's wrong with her? He doesn't do it on purpose. That girl too isn't so innocent. I'll punch you right on your face! Ensure you warn your husband and ask him to behave properly! Mind it! Yes sir? Inspector Kumaran. I'm here to see the doctor. Sir, kindly wait for sometime. We will call you. Savithri, if you think your husband is innocent then support him. It is tough to find a man who respects women and doesn't abuse them. So don't fall for her words and lock horns with him. Correct madam! That is why you are required around to solve issues. Can you guys wind up a bit soon? It's getting late for me. Didn't I make an appointment before coming? Appointment? Aadhirai here. Do I have any appointment? Oh! Is it? Fine. - You guys may leave. - Ok madam. I am inspector at Ambattur. I met with a major accident 3 months ago. Hence, I'm here for a psychiatric evaluation. Incident. I didn't get that. It's not an accident. It's an incident. High traumatic, near death incident. Oh. I'm sorry. My bad. It's been 3 months. I am alright now. I was informed that this is a formality and hence officially nothing has been... Formality? No. I am ok now. My doctors have already approved. Any of them a psychiatrist? Sorry? Any of them a psychiatrist? No. That's not a good start. It's not a good thing. Let me apologize to you first. In case, if I had been mean to you. No. No problem. It's ok. Fine. So what was the last movie you watched? Come on now. I was bed ridden for 3 months. That's not the question for me. Well, patients these days... watch a lot of movies when they are bed ridden. Either they do that or else doze off. When I was affected with Typhoid last year... I watched 11 movies. Excuse me. I am a police officer. I can't support piracy and watch movies using torrents. Then do one thing. Next time you are bed ridden... make someone buy you original DVDs of some old hit movies and watch them. Believe me, it helps. It will keep you from thinking about your plight and when you'll recover. It'll distract your mind from all those. That's what I meant. Where did you study medicine? Here is a color photocopy of my certificate. The original is pledged in the bank. I'm currently repaying the loan. Ok? I'm sorry. I was just kidding. Please don't mistake me. Nothing wrong in what you asked. Why are you apologizing? No. I am sorry. It was just a casual talk. See, what's wrong in it? For instance when you are not in your uniform... if anyone asks for your identity, won't you show your badge? In that case you must apologize. You are still afraid. What? I didn't get that. That incident still haunts you and even now there is fear inside you. It is not advisable for you to join back in the force now. Better undergo the treatment for few more days before joining. How can you be so sure that I am still afraid? I am the doctor here. You, my patient. I can't prove this fact using an X- Ray. You sound like a retard. Let me see that degree certificate once again. If I already knew that you are an egoist officer who refuses to show his badge... I wouldn't have even shown my certificate the first time. My guess was correct. It was to confirm that you still have fear inside you I said that. You are quite short tempered. Temper is directly proportional to fear. You fool! Sorry. I didn't do it Beasts! Thrashing them ends up in us having joint pains. Remember, you are merely gulping down water. I seriously mean it... the way you are gulping down the water is a bit over acting. Even the water would be embarrassed. How dare that retard talk to me like that? Who is the retard you talk about? Who else? That psycho doctor. Officer you are the sole witness. What did I tell him when he promised to buy us drinks? Didn't I make him promise not to talk about that doctor? Indeed. Promises are null and void amongst drunkards. In that case, you too must have been drunk inspector. So you keep up your promise. Tell him brother. Just leave it. After all he is our own officer. Let him say what ever he wants. Need an extra hand? No thanks. Everything's good. No one needs extra hands or legs here. Just mind your business. What's with the permission? Just join in. Thank you sir. Listen, a scoundrel has been caught red handed. Go and hand him some thrashes. Chain snatching? No, Eve teasing case. The girl is admitted in the hospital. - Filthy fellow! - Hey you! I meant him not you. He must be thrashed first. Doesn't show any respect at all. So tell me mister Sub inspector... won't it hurt if any girl calls you a coward? Is that what that doctor exactly called you? Why should it be exactly that? Isn't it enough that she meant it? Why does a sober fellow got to do with honor, valor and pride? No use talking about honor and valor with those who find valor after getting drunk! Yes. Correct. Good night. Did he mind it? I don't care if did but he took the bottle along with him! Listen, how did you clear the 'mental' test and get the clearance certificate? It is not called 'mental' test. It is psychiatric evaluation. Yeah. So how did you clear it? Don't let it out. I requested the DSP sir. He arranged another doctor and got me a clearance certificate. No retard girl should stop me from joining the force. Good morning sir. Good morning. Sir cash or card? I'm running low on cash. How about card? Sir, the bill amounts to just 183 bucks and we can't accept card. - Would you like to buy something else? - Let me check. One..two. I have two hundred cash. Here mam. Here sir. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Excuse me sir. - Yeah? There is a shortage of 5 bucks in that change. Really? - Please do check it sir. - Why don't you check it? - Sorry sir - It's ok. Are you a student? Thanks But I am doctor. Psychiatrist. Wonderful. Then I got diverted into business management and marketing. By the way, I am Rudran. And I'll give you my card. I know you. You are a motivational guru. You are a mentor who instills confidence into the minds of thousands. Wow! I never knew that I was so popular. Don't come to that conclusion based on what I said. I belong to the same field... ...and knowing about people like you helps me in my profession. Quite true. Why don't you attend my class sometime? I have already attended. Guess some 3 months ago. Really? I don't believe in such motivating sessions like you carry out. Self help and motivational session could provide, may be a small boost. I strongly believe that it won't bring about a big change in life. Thank you. See you. - Sir please. - You! Sir...Sir...please let me off. - Sir, please sir. - Get in. Sir, you were chasing me the other day But someone else knocked you out. I'm really sorry sir. I've already been punished but why again? My body can't take it anymore. Is it? You thought we'll let you escape? Don't worry, this time you won't be thrashed by all of us. Only he will. Yes sir? Sir. At Vavin road? I'll be there in 5 minutes. - Murthy. - Yes sir? - To Vavin road. - Ok sir. Murder? No doubt in it right? No doubt sir. She was back after late night shoot. Only her personal make up man had accompanied her. We have sent the obtained finger prints to the lab for testing. His number too is not reachable. Also there are evidences of a rape attempt. Press leak? Nothing yet. But...it was reported directly to the D.I.G. - Directly to the D.I.G? - Yes sir. Is she very popular? Indeed. Her name is Vimhsa. Currently the top actress. - Free him. - Ok sir. Should I wake her up? - Sir! - Sir. What happened sir? Welcome sir. How have you been? I need a room. Quick. Single or double occupancy? - You! Just make it fast! - Ok sir. Don't get upset. I am here for real. I saw you outside the shopping mall. I followed you. Mr. Kumaran you need help. Please listen to me. Mr. Kumaran! - Mr. Kumaran. - Get lost! Sir! Sir! What happened sir? Please wait. What happened? Please sir. What happened? No problem sir. My house is in the neighborhood. Just come over and rest for an hour. You look very tired. Don't think. Just come with me sir. Hey! Haven't you guys started yet? We are about to. - You are running out of time. Quick. - Ok. Dad, you too join us please. I've lot of work dear. So quit it and come along with us. Clever girl! - Ok now start. - Come on. Welcome. Ok. Leave. Come on. Here. There is a cab waiting. - Call me after you reach. - Okay. What next? Aren't you the doctor who advised him not to join back in the force? Yes. Wasn't I correct in saying so? If he hadn't joined then this wouldn't have happened. Wait. Hold on. He must take this shot. Or else he'll get into more trouble. No way. When I left him the room he was slowly turning normal. I guess a good sound sleep will cure him. Go check. Check if he is asleep. He is one of the most trustworthy and important individual in the department. Please take care of him. Kumaran. Kumaran! Don't you understand? Get out! Take this shot. Then I shall leave. Stop staring! Hold yourself Kumaran! A popular celebrity has been murdered. I receive a complaint saying you were not there in the spot for even 5 minutes. It has been escalated. High profile recommendation. Sir, I need 15 days off. What?! Sir, yesterday I had a mental break down. Stress disorder. The doctor who analyzed me was indeed correct. I'm still haunted by that incident. More over, yesterday's murder and the murder committed... ...by the person who was about to kill me were quite similar. I am unable to be calm and composed. Please forgive me sir. Can I talk to Saravanan? Ask him to talk to me immediately. First you must learn to control yourself from getting provoked. And so these exercises will help you in achieving that. Sort it meanwhile I'll be back. "Slow and steady, let me care for you." "Slow and steady, let me bring happiness into your life." "Let me hear you out; let me care." "Let me touch your heart." "Slow and steady, let me care for you." "Slow and steady, let me bring happiness into your life." "Let me hear you out; let me care." "Let me touch your heart." "As the universe aligns itself and sprinkles us with rain of affection." "So come join me and let's wake up together in this new world." "My heart beat rises when you are not around but it calms down at the sight of you." "As the universe aligns itself sprinkles us with rain of affection." "So come join me and let's wake up together in this new world." "My heart beat rises when you are not around" "But it calms down at the sight of you." "Love is a drop of rain that mixes in the sea." "Yet the sky searches for it and gets it back again." "Love is a drop of rain that mixes in the sea." "Yet the sky searches for it and gets it back again." You must have many patients Yet why give me a special care and attention? It is easy to identify some people... who will require such help throughout their life. He looks like he is steady and fit. I'm yet to begin the treatment. This is just something to warm him up. "Love is a drop of rain that mixes in the sea." "Yet the sky searches for it and gets it back again." My pet dog, Samba... I jumped into the well to rescue it. My sister too followed and she too didn't know how to swim. She came in search of me. I'm gasping for breath! I'm gasping! "Slow and steady, let me care for you." "Slow and steady, let me bring happiness into your life." "Let me hear you out; let me care." "Let me touch your heart." "Slow and steady, let me care for you." "Slow and steady, let me bring happiness into your life." "Let me hear you out; let me care." "Let me touch your heart." "As the universe aligns itself and sprinkles us with rain of affection." "So come join me and let's wake up together in this new world." "My heart beat rises when you are not around" - Lift him up. - Hey what are you up to? Hey! Leave me! "Love is a drop of rain that mixes in the sea." Sir come on. Help! Help! The boat isn't moving anywhere. Swim to the boat. Doctor, he might be in danger. - Say something. - Wait. Don't do anything until I say. "Yet the sky searches for it and gets it back again." Take that rope. Throw it. Sir, catch hold of the rope and come. - Come on sir. - Pull! Pull! What's the surprise? A surprise... shouldn't be revealed. We are not going in the police vehicle. So come on. Let's take my car. He is Rudran. India's #1 motivational speaker. He has changed many lives. In fact, you could have taken me to him instead of toiling so hard. Things would've been easy. Oh! I was just kidding. His seminar is called... 'Confidence is believing.' I know. I've been here earlier. No problem. Come on. This is indeed a surprise. This is my 1st time here. How is it usually? It's boring for me. Excuse me, can you scooch. We are together. I can't! We will go and sir there Come on It's ok. Fox, down. Please be seated. Words like self confidence, hope... You all know what it means. All you have is the understanding of it. But what about realization? None of you have it! There is a vast difference between understanding and realizing. First, one must realize. One must work hard to make it a habit. It's tough. It is something that can be achieved by discipline and dedication. Talent is very very cheap. Dedication is everything. - Sorry. - Now, I'm going to teach you... some simple techniques. Follow them and... try turning these into habits. Stop it I say! Refund me the 15,000 bucks I paid up. Fox! I've attended a week of your sessions. I am still the same. All my burdens and debts continue to remain put! Stop cheating the people. Don't you talk about confidence! Come Listen! Do not waste your money! Security. Did I promise you a job? Or did I advertise to pay your debt? I've helped you enhance your life style. Yet my life style still continues to be the same! Look at yourself! Yelling out with confidence amidst so many people. You have become confident. Isn't it? That is what I am preaching here. Apply this confidence on something good... ...and you may prosper. Stop blabbering! Let go off me! Stop cheating! I'll make sure that I get back my money! Let me make it clear to all. I am not marketing anything here! Nor is this a short cut to success. All you can get from a one day workshop is a small idea. Then it's up to you to cling on to that idea, learn it... and prepare yourself. And that brings to the end of this session. Hello? - Hope you guys enjoyed it. - You just dozed off! You were snoring. Hi sir. I'm Kumaran. - Crime branch. - Wow. I'm surprised. A police inspector in my class. You appear to be a very progressive person. Thank you. Your seminar was quite interesting. It is very useful. Sorry. This is Dr. Aadhirai. She is psychiatrist. Hello. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? Isn't she here because you insisted? Yes sir. I thought so. Have a seat. Don't insist on dealing the same case again. Trust me sir. I promise to solve it. I have got no problem with that. Too much pressure from either side. One second. Please connect me to crime branch officer Saravanan. I'm 50 year old now. Such cases are too risky for my age. It will then affect the remarks on me. It suits you just fine. You can handle it. Sir, what are the forensic experts doing about it? There is another murder that is very similar to this. It was while chasing that murderer I got hospitalized. He died during that incident. After 3.5 months exactly a murder in a similar way. A case with so many similarities. Can't they link and investigate? You asked me for the case sheet. I handed it to you. You take it forward. Stop creating a ruckus. Tell me what assistance you require and I'll have it arranged. No thank you sir. I'll take care of it. Excuse me. You had said that, last 10 days before his death, your son kind of acted strange. Can you explain us it in detail? I could see that his behavior was changing slowly. Suddenly he stopped talking to me. He started staring in a mean way. Then out of the blue he started talking. But there was a peculiar change in his behavior. Peculiar change in behavior? Like what? He stopped training people in the gym. He doesn't have the habit of reading. But then my daughter in law said that he started reading English articles. He started smoking. Thanks madam. From the beginning of her acting career, he was her favorite make up man. It's been 15 days since her death and he has not yet returned home. His phone too is not reachable. It's all a mystery to us. But the last 3-4 months he was with us,... ...he was totally a changed person. He acted quite strange. It was to get him admitted... I requested my brother to come down. When I reached here, the minute he saw me he acted like I was a stranger. Then somehow he managed and made it up. I was taken aback. Can you please switch on the motor? Just a minute sir. I'll be back. Sir, actually... Tell me whatever it is. Like I said he was totally a changed person. He kept cleaning all his things over and again. Also the way he looked at my daughter too was quite strange and fishy. I was scared. I don't believe in ghosts and spirits. But I have no answers to the way he behaved. Any change in his physical appearance? Nothing like that. He looked normal in that way. Just a minute. All of a sudden he started reading such books We have never seen him read English books. He also started dying his hair. Isn't it? Yes. The last time I saw him, he had dyed his hair. Any recent photo? Just a minute. Here, have a look. Murthy. He was here four days ago, attending the session. A prime suspect in a murder. I need the CCTV footage and all the contact details he had provided. Here you go sir. Murthy, verify this new address and phone number. - Do you believe in ghosts or spirits? - No sir. That make up man was using that number for 10 days. But no calls made or received. Did you track the SIM card? The SIM is inactive as of now. But we have the IMEI number of the phone used to activate that SIM. He has now inserted a new SIM in it... and that SIM has been used to make one call, that too 6 days before. To where? Hotel Royal Plaza. I need his details. Room# 208. Sir? Where is the guest? I don't know. He stepped out. - Do you know where? - No sir. Is he a criminal? Put him behind the bars sir! He is troublesome! He orders the room to be cleaned 5 times a day. Rascal! He doesn't even tip! What happened? Do you know when this room guest will return? He is at the bar upstairs. "As you get lost in a ball of fire inside the drug..." "Near me and you will feel the ocean around you." "Even the still doll seems like its laughing at you." "So control yourself, don't touch me and keep a safe distance." "No one can near me." "So wait and watch my move." "Many may come, many may go but I'll continue to live and prosper." "Time is the only hero that can you help you challenge me." "Diva! Diva!" "Try nearing me!" "Diva! Diva!" "Can you defeat death and reach me?" "Diva! Diva!" "Try nearing me!" "Diva! Diva!" "I am beyond time; so come catch me." "Diva! Diva!" "Try nearing me!" "Diva! Diva!" "Can you defeat death and reach me?" "Diva! Diva!" "Try nearing me!" "Diva! Diva!" "I am beyond time; so come catch me." What would you like to have? Brandy? Whiskey? You are the prime suspect in actress Vimsha's murder. We need to inquire you. Come along. If you investigate me when I am inebriated... there is a high chance I might spit the truth. Isn't it? Leave me. Leave! I didn't refuse to come. I need to talk to you in person. "Diva! Diva!" "Diva! Diva!" "Can you defeat death and reach me?" Wait here. "I am beyond time; so come catch me." How about a smoke? Why did you murder Vimsha? You won't understand even if I explain. Why? Can it be only understood by beasts like you? It's not an understanding. It's realization. Didn't you learn in Rudran's seminar? Why did you want to talk to me in person? Do you know the reason behind the delay of the second murder I committed? What about the 1st murder? What do you mean? Exactly 5 minutes after I committed the 1st murder... you reached the spot! You chased me. Both of us... fought to death. In fact... I died... and you were saved. What are you blabbering? Just a minute. I'll be back. This body is a waste! I'll deal with you later. Arrest him Karna. - Hey! - Wait! Don't run! Stop! Stop! Don't you run! Both of you must be suspended! We believed the recommendations you had from other officers The situations is quite mysterious. We don't think you guys can take control and handle the responsibility. We are letting you off with a strong remark. Be careful. You may go. How can we let it off so easy? You finished off a killer saying he tried to kill you. Now you say this guy committed suicide. I died... and you were saved. I'll deal with you later. That's not the right way to consume water. Never pour the water directly into your throat. You must sip it and swallow it with your saliva. Just one day... can you let me of the hook and give me no health advises? You'll be blessed. Fine. Ok. Well, let's not talk about your health. How about your kick boxing? Is there any subject that is out of your reach madam? Well, there is cooking. I don't know how to cook. I must learn. Hello? - I was here on my morning walk. - Your contact number? Make way. - Sir! - Sir! He is the head of advance center of neurology. Name: Narayanan. He is one among the top three in his domain. Neurology? His specializes in brain. He is well renowned in brain research. Major science institutions have declared holiday. The murderer was wearing gloves. We couldn't obtain any finger prints. Sir, any clue? Here is my assumption of what would have happened here. Early morning, the scientist must have been here on his morning walk. There is a major difference between the murders that happened earlier and this one. Here the victim is a male. The murderer was careful about getting caught while committing this. He was wearing gloves. But at the same time he is indicating a link between the earlier murders and this one. Sir! I don't understand a zilch. The murderers are different. The 1st confusion is that all the murders are executed in the exact same manner. Over that you say this murder is a bit different. I don't get it. Sir, could it be ghosts or spirits? Even I am confused. The earlier murders had petty motives. Like rage or for pleasure. But this particular murder seems to have a motive behind it. - Brother. - Yes? Note this serial number and ask Murthy to follow it. Ok. Find out when it was applied and the other details. Ok. Fine. That will be all. This book? He spoke to me about this once. - His name is... - Rudran. Yes, Rudran. My dad wasn't much impressed with this book. I'm not sure if he even completed the book. Why do you ask? He conducts seminars. Has your dad ever been to any of them? No way. Not a chance. My dad conducts seminars in Stanford. I'm sure he would have never attended such seminars. Thank you. Sir is conducting a session right now. He will be out in few minutes. Please wait. - I'll talk about it in next session. - Excuse me sir. They are here to meet you. Hello sir. How are you? Come in. Sir. Are you alright? Of course. I am alright. What happened? Why do you look dull? - Tell me Mr... - Kumaran. Yep. Sorry. I forgot. - How are you? - I'm fine. If you don't mind, can I ask you something? And what would that be? Do you... smoke regularly? Or... I quit after a point and then start again. Not a chain smoker though. Do you know anything about scientist Narayanan? A scientist? A scientist in which domain? Name sounds quite familiar. He is a renowned scientist. Specializes in Brain Neurology Sorry. I don't know him. He had been reading your book. Hence I just wanted to find out if he had attended any of your seminars? Or if you knew him? That is what bought me to you. No. No. No. No. Are you alright? How long has he been smoking? Did he use to smoke earlier? No sir. No. No. Sir! Sir! Where are you off to? - Isn't this his pet? - Yes sir. Usually its very quiet in the seminars. What's wrong now? I have no idea. It's gone mad. For the past four days it keeps barking at Rudran sir. In fact it tried attacking him once. Hence he ordered it to be tied outside. Sir, please have some patience and listen to me. You must surrender yourself to the police custody. Please. Its for your welfare. You might be in danger or you might be a danger to someone else. Please. Sir, there is a reason why I am saying it. What ever is happening to you has happened to- -couple of them before and both of them are dead. We have no clue who is behind all this or why this is happening! Get out! I'm a Crime inspector. You have no clue what I can do with my powers. Yet I am being polite with you. And you have no clue what I can do with my powers. If I inform my lawyer, then under the charges of mental torture... I can make you run around fighting the case for a year, in the court. You have been insulting me way too much. Now, get out! We'll see. Too many coincidences. We must keep observing him and trap him. The most important thing, we must capture him alive! All I asked was the money I paid! Hey! Stop! Stop! Hey! Stop! Return my wallet! Give me my wallet man! Come on! Fox! Shut up! What is it Rudran sir? Looks like there is dust all over you? Fox! Stop! Try barking now! 'Intermission' Newly married? Do not respond to him Saravana. Just bring him. Sign here. To be accurate... you must also create a dental record. What would you do with my finger prints if I set myself ablaze? This is the first signature Rudran signed and then he struck it off. The forensic experts have recreated the struck off signature for us. As per their suggestion... the ideal name could be Pramod. A person signs a different signature only if... he has changed his name or... if he has changed his signature. Rudran doesn't fall in either category. So the question that raises here is, whose signature is this? Why did Rudran sign that name? Sir, it could be an attempt to divert us. Come on sir. We are behind this case for the past 3 months. We are not even close to even having any evidences. So please. I feel we must cling on to this and make a break through. Rest everything seems to be quite confusing like some science fiction. Mr. Subash. Karna is right. Even if it is misleading it is best that we follow this. But sir it is fine if we have to find a person. But how do we find someone using their signature? Do you have any idea how many Pramods are there here? In which case we will have to search the whole country. We can't search in a such generalized manner. Our main central node is Rudran. We can only target his circle. My daughter in law said he started reading English articles. Out of the blue he started reading such books. My dad conducts seminars in Stanford. Hello? Hello. This is inspector Kumaran here. Yes, tell me sir. Does your dad know anyone called Pramod? Pramod? Any of your dad's classmates, students or colleagues by that name? I am not sure. Mom might just know. Hold on. I'll pass the phone to her. Madam, do you know anyone by the name Pramod? Did you say Pramod? Yes he used to work with my husband. Used to? What about now? Doesn't he work there anymore? Yes. He quit the job there. Any idea why? Sorry, I have no idea. Why don't you try inquiring at the institute? You might get an answer. Ok madam. Thanks. - Tea or coffee? - No thanks. This is the brochure from the recent conference we held. On the left is the former CEO, Narayanan. And the person shaking hands with the army officer... is Pramod, whom you are inquiring about. Finally! We have our man! Sir! You may order the tea now. Does he still reside at the same address? Or has he relocated? Aren't you aware? It's almost 6 months since he passed away. How did he die? It was a natural death. Fine. Is any of his family members available? No one. Only his wife. She had a fall, by the well in their backyard and... descended into coma. Her condition remains to be critical. Sir, our condition is ever worse. Any close friends of Dr. Pramod? There is Mr. Velayudham. You can meet him in the science lab upstairs. You go there meanwhile I'll inform him. Thanks. - Hi sir. - Hi. I'm inspector Kumaran. Is he troubling you even after his death? Just 2 years senior. But an immensely talented fellow! Sir, did Pramod work under Narayanan? Of course, all of us worked under Narayanan. Because he was the director of the institute. Pramod envied him because actually Pramod was supposed to be the director. But Narayanan used his political influence and became the director. Looks like he won't complete any book! Beer? No, thank you. Here. Thank you. Come on now! Pramod hated the fact that he had to report to Narayanan. Is Dr. Pramod indeed more intelligent than Narayanan? Of course! None can match him. He is a wizard! He was already an all India gold medalist in medical science, M.B.B.S, The he achieved his doctorate in neuro science and... then he came to Tamil Nadu and mastered the Siddha medicine. Finally, he studied nano medicine and again he was the university topper. At the age of 50... he made the best breakthrough in neuroscience, in the whole world wide. Sir can you give us some information about his research? That is classified Mr. Kumaran. I wonder who is the next wackadoodle coming in as replacement for Mr. Narayanan. I don't have the rights to reveal those details. Not even to the police? This comes under the central government mister. What you are asking for is very very sensitive. Well consider it to be as sensitive as military secrets. Sir, there are lot of confusions and difficult knots in this case. We are already stressed! The only lead we got was Dr. Pramod. We are devastated after knowing that he too passed away. If we don't get any information on this further then this case is a dead end. What are you saying? Murder? Did anyone murder Pramod? No sir. Else, did Pramod murder anyone? Sir... I'll explain you everything about the case. Let me know if anything strikes you. Around 6 months ago, a woman named Devi was murdered at Madipakkam. The murderer was a person named Dheena. He was a gym trainer. Indeed. I do recollect. Dheena was Pramod's trainer. He was pretty close friends with him. What are you saying? Dheena was Pramod's gym trainer? Yes. Indeed. Ok, now there are many links than we expected. I don't know how but Pramod is involved in all the murders. 5 murders have taken place. There is a common link in all 5 murders. Let me explain the pattern in it. The characteristics of a particular person and his habits change all of a sudden. For example, a normal person... suddenly becomes too obsessive about cleanliness. Well to the level where they even hold a glass with a tissue paper. Similarly they start to smoke. That too a peculiar black cigarette. Specifically, a particular brand. And above all, the most important... they begin to have lusty attitude towards women. One minute. One minute. Where did I place it? Check if this is the brand? Sir! Indeed it is! This is Pramod's brand. The character of that particular person, both physically and psychologically changes. Which is confusing. They have murdered people within few days of change in their behavior. They aren't afraid of getting caught while committing the murder. The finger prints are obtained and it's quite easy to crack who did it. But when we near and surround the murderer... ...by hook or crook they find a way to suicide. And just like a scheduled plan, a replacement turns up. I mean someone else's body... is possessed, just like he claims. Of all the murders, only Narayanan's murder had a motive. Because the murderer was wearing a gloves while murdering him alone. How do you link Pramod to all these murders? Quite simple. The last murderer, whom we have arrested... singed Pramod's signature. He then struck it off and then signed again with his signature. What the heck? Gentlemen... since there is lot of connection between the cases you are dealing and Pramod... I shall disclose the confidential details of his research that was rusticated. I'm over looking the rules here and sharing it with you. If the media or the public comes to know of it then it'll trigger chaos. Project Maayavan. This was the title of Pramod's research. He was striving to invent a technology to copy humans. What do you mean? For example. Who are you? - Sir? - Who are you? Kumaran. So what do you answer when you are asked 'Who are you?' You say out your name. How does that happen? Your parents gave you a name... ...and everyone around you calls you out with that name. This is stored by you brain, in your memory and hence you are able to answer. The memories are what makes you Kumaran. The life inside everyone is the same. But we all differentiated by our memories. It's your thought process and memories that instigates you to investigate. It's my thought process that has made me a researcher. Now, out side your brain... if I make an exact copy of it... isn't it similar to have made a copy of you? All that we call our memories, biologically speaking... are nothing but different chemicals in different shapes inside our brain. And neurons are what connects these differently shaped chemicals. He kick started this research using a rat's brain. And that because, there is not much difference in... ...the mechanism of the human brain and rat brain He injected a silicon electronic gel into it's brain... ...to generate the shock waves residing in it's brain... which in turn installs thousands of nano transmitters... ...from the electronic gel into every neurons in the brain. Once the process of copying is activated... the nano transmitters collects all the physical information in the brain... and transfers it digitally using a fiber optic cable. It forms the complete digital structure of the rat's brain and... gets copied into a hard disk. In simple terms... it's like copying a song from a cassette, in analog form to... into CD, in digital format. The CEO before Narayanan... was impressed by this technology. Pramod got his approval to copy human brain using this technology and... constructed a lab in the institute, specially made for this. The biggest risk of doing this research on human is... that even a small screw up... would result in that individual descending into coma or turn retard... Or worst, one could die. Without even a consideration or value for human life... he worked vigorously towards achieving success in this research. In fact... at one point, he went to the extent of risking his own life. He injected his brain with the electronic gel. His copied the data from his physical brain using latest wireless technology. He succeeded in copying it completely into a digital hard disk. Using this memory back up... even after your death, no one can erase you until the copy of your memories are alive. You can call it more or less like immortality. Sir... won't there be any side effects of injecting the artificial silicon gel into human brain? Which is why... he is being rated as one of the top most scientist in the world. His inventions are that accurate. In fact, until his last day at work with us... the gel that he injected in his brain was still inside. He was perfectly normal. There are instances in the medical history where individuals... ...have survived for 30 years with bullet inside a brain. Moving on to the next level of this research... the memories and skillset of an individual's brain... had to be translated into another human's brain. Could be Pramod's bad luck, that the old CRO was replaced and... Narayanan became the new CRO. It was when he approached Narayanan to move further in this research... If data from an individual's brain... can be imposed in to another individual's brain... ...then it's almost like winning over death. What crap is this? - Did you just say crap? - Yeah! First of all... what is that you are concluding in this research. First tell me what's your understanding? You are here because of minister's recommendation! Gentlemen relax. Let them both discuss. No more arguments. Science must be helpful to mankind. It shouldn't turn dangerous. I quit! I am not one of you, who comes here just to earn his livelihood. I don't want to plead and beg him every time for an research approval. - I know how to do it. - Pramod. Cool down. Then later... he met our department's minister... and tried impressing him directly with this project. Oh lord! Project Maayavan. So tell me... what made you think that I will recommend for this project? Sir, through this project Maayavan... I can make you live for a 1000 years. We can use the brain samples of Dr.Abdul Kalam... ...and bring him back to life. But, incapable people like Narayanan.... ...are promoted as CRO of institute by you. Which is why science and technology are stranded in our country. Enough! Stop it. The so called science and technology has developed enough to touch the satellites. The latest 3G/4G technology has messed up our privacy. On one hand the satellites have penetrated enough to reach our toilets. On the other hand you say you want to penetrate into another individual's head. That's a brutal thought you got there! Is there no humanity in you at all? Tell me this... you say you want to erase someone else's identity and live in that individual... ...that too for a 1000 years. Are you that scared of death? Because of your research trial, an individual has succumbed to indefinite comma. Is it recorded in your report? It is to supervise and report about people such as you... I personally recommended Mr. Narayanan to the CRO post! Do you think a scientist has the privilege of misusing science? Are you a psychopath? Ever heard about sitthar sages from ancient times? They are known to exchange souls between bodies. But they died without disclosing that secret to the world. Do you know why? So that people like you shouldn't misuse it. Multinational companies are very keen on this project. Are you aware? Now what? Showing me your arrogance? Nothing is beyond the god. But that doesn't mean you should aim to become god! Don't you get it? Of late no one understands what politicians has to say. If I give a little space then you would get into... ...my head and get your project approved. Hence I will inform Mr. Narayanan right away and... I officially ban this research. Do you get in now? Out! Post that we totally lost touch with him. One fine day, we received an information that he passed away. But based on what you all said... ...looks like he might have just achieved immortality. Is it possible? Only he can answer it. The style in which he has placed his feet on his shoe. The way he his handling his cigarette with his left hand. This is ditto Pramod. I got it authorized using your password. Its ok. I'll take care of it. This is the modern 'Truth Serum.' The result of LSD mixed with 'Truth Serum'... gives this output. A medicine that will make one speak the truth. It has never been used on anyone in India. Because the law here doesn't allow it. Hence, under the influence of this medicine... if he spits out the truth, the law won't accept it. This case seems to be beyond the law. Hence, the primary step here is to find out the truth. Ok sir. - Yeah. - Ok. Go ahead Careful. It can be used only once on him. Ok. If we have to use it on him again... ...then we will have to wait for days. Pramod. Pramod. Do you recognize me? I'm your colleague, Velayudham. Can you hear me Pramod? Yes. I...hear...you. Was your death a natural one or was it a suicide? Suicide. But why? Why did you commit suicide? Pramod? He is trying to fight the medicine. We don't have much time. How do you copy the data of your brain into another individual's brain? How do you take over another individual's brain? I imposed the digital back up of my brain in to another individual's brain. The first person I selected was Dheena. My gym trainer. I injected his brain with the electronic gel and... using that I installed thousands of seventh generation smart nano transmitters... in the neurons present in Dheena's brain. Immediately... all my digital memories present in the hard disk... ...gets copied into that transmitters. When he regained his consciousness he was normal as usual. In order to find out if my experiment was a success or failure... I had to commit suicide. At the last second before my death... the nano transmitters in my brain... sends signal to Dheena's brain and activates the copying process. In the first stage... the nano transmitters generates devised shock waves in Dheena's brain and erases off his memory. Immediately, my digital memories present in the transmitters... will get copied into his brain. Now, this time when he regained his conscious.... his body is...taken over by me. As a new human. As far as I am alive in someone else's body... the hard disk in the lab gets updated with my running memory. Fine but why did you kill that gym trainer's wife? Very irritating person! What's with this new habit of smoking? You have been acting strange lately. How dare you smoke inside the house? Of late your activities make me wonder if you are indeed my husband! What about actress Vimsha? You very well know why I killed her. Thank you. Please get the cheque. Come on now! Stop that habit. It's clean. This isn't a lab and that is not a chemical. Keeps wiping it often! It's become a habit. It's been years since we had an outing and some quality time such as this. Last, we had an outing during our 25th wedding anniversary. The next outing is going to be 60th wedding anniversary Did you hear? You. Please move. Madam, you go ahead. Move. Make way. He spends almost all his time in the lab. Looks like you have forgot to enjoy the beautiful things around you Pramod. I must start enjoying it soon. Live life as a new human being. Sorry. Sorry. - Shit! - Sorry sir. Sorry. Are you blind? Listen. I said I am sorry. If those nonsense are pouncing upon you, can't you move away? Excuse me sir! Show some respect! She didn't do it on purpose. She even apologized. Why are you being rude? Your madam might be ok with anything or anyone falling upon her. But I ain't like that. How dare you?! Forget it. - Poor old fellow. Why beat him? - What the heck? No use talking to people who can't respect others. How dare you slap him? I'll finish you off! Be careful! I made up my mind that moment itself. That I'll kill her using her own make up man! But how? From the body of one person... how did you manage to get into another person's body? How is that even possible? The moment I resurrected in Dheena's body... I selected my next target... and copied my up to date digital memory in the same way into his brain like I did in Dheena's brain. Then when I die again... the other person gets activated. Now, I would have resurrected in him. And so... the moment the make up man died... I resurrected in Rudran's body. Now... Rudran must be killed. Only then, along with my latest memories... I can resurrect in the next target's body. How do you do that? Where do you do that? It can be performed only in my lab. Where is your lab? My lab! Where is your lab? My...lab! Pramod... - Where is that lab? - Lab... Ask him who is his next target. If you commit suicide now... in whose body will you get activated? Tell me Pramod! Who gets activated? Pramod! Come on doctor! Who is it? Come on doctor. Who is it? No! Come on. Come on! - No! - Dr. Pramod! Come on! Who is it? Who will get activated? Whose body are you going to take over? Tell me Pramod! Tell me! On whom have you set the nano transmitters? Who is it? Who? Pramod. Who is it? Sir! Stop him! Sir are you alright? How dare you inject me the medicine! You son of a gun! No Kumaran! Karna! Control yourself. - Check him. - Sir are you ok? I'm ok. - I'm ok. - Stop staring! If we don't find whom Pramod has set up then all our efforts so far will go waste. We can't waste time anymore. Find out scientist Pramod's... friends, relatives, students and staff. Get me a list with all of them. Where is the lady from that house admitted? That's her. Here sir. - Here? - Yes. Madam. - Madam? - Who is she? Dr. Pramod's wife. She is in coma. Did she ever come into her senses? I was informed that she blinked her eyes once. I never saw it happen. Is that all your dedication at work? Come on now. She is not the only patient here! Don't you judge just like that! You must have been on the phone! Listen madam. Your husband has wrecked havoc. And look at you sleeping peacefully. If her senses turn back or even if she blinks... please inform to this number immediately. But my dedication ain't up to that level. Don't mind what he said. - Please. - Please do warn him. Hello! Sir, there are hundreds of profiles in this. How do we zero in on the particular individual? Aadhirai? As per my psychological analysis on the 134 profiles presented, if I have to arrange them in top to bottom order... then these are the top 15 out of them. Because these 15 are very strong, have healthy medical records and... possess a high stature in the society. Does these 15 profiles contain the profile of the person we are looking for? Well, Rudran will show it to us. Do you recognize what this is Dr. Pramod? Polygraph. First they gave me a drug to find out the truth. And now this. Lights on. As I expected... Rudran has deceived us in pulse reading. His pulse seems to be steady. There was no major fluctuation. Sir... this polygraph test was just running in the front. We did another test in the background, face reading. Which means, a test based on the minute change in the the face reactions... to find out a person's state of mind. If he had found out about it he would have controlled his face expressions too. Hence, he was informed only about the poly graphic test... and his face expressions have been recorded in a camera secretly. We showed this footage to a face reader, Mr. Vincent. Change in reaction at time 3.08 in the footage. At that instance it showed your photo. Then again at 3.22. Where Pramod is shaking hands with an army officer. It is very obvious that he had panicked at these two instances. The photo from the conference... is indeed army Major Sathyan. After inquiring... we found that Pramod and Major are good friends since college. Major arrives here at Chennai tomorrow morning 11. We can make him understand the situation. I believe we can do it. His next target must be army Major Sathyan. We can't rely on beliefs here Kumaran. He is an army man. It is risky to near him without any assured permission. Though we don't have evidences to legally incriminate... ...at least we must know. That the path we are in is the right one. Sir, how about we try this out. Lets tell Rudran... that we found that army Major is his next target. What if he panics and tries to commit suicide? Then we can confirm it. Shut up Karna! Why not? Let's try that out. Sir? Are you serious? Yes. I don't see any other way. Let's try it. Pramod, how could you just rat out Major so easy? That was a dummy polygraph test. We found who is next using face reading. Isn't it army Major Sathyan? One autograph please. Forget it Karna. We shall get it from Major. Let's plead and he might just sign it for us. Sir please. Please. Please. He won't Karna. He is quite furious. See you Pramod. Come on Karna. Karna! Karna! Hold on! Let him go! I said leave him! Karna! Are you alright? Karna? Are you alright? What did the doctor say? No problem if he is saved... Or else? Doctor how is he? The bullet that pierced his body... ...has hurt his wind pipe very bad. We have controlled the situation for now. But we can give a proper answer only after the wound heals. Thanks doctor. He is a motivational speaker, why would he commit suicide? Is it indeed a suicide or is it a police Encounter? I can't answer to the assumptions you make. Sir, series of murders are happening in the city. So far what has the police department done about it? Wait. Hold on. The inquiry is going on. I shall arrange a press meet and answer your questions then. Sir, do you think Major will believe all this? We shall approach casually, like we are here to fix an appointment with him. So is that all? What else can we do? He is an army Major. We can't do much. - Keep updating me every hour. - Ok sir. - Check the saturation. - Ok. - Suction, second hourly once. - Ok sir. Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Please move. Ok. See you. Hello? What is it sir? Sir? Excuse me sir. Can I just have a moment... Please sir. Just one meeting. Sir we might get some loop and we can proceed with that. If we hadn't nabbed Rudran then we would have never got so far. We have already tampered with the system a lot. We already need to clear the mess we have made. He isn't a normal person amongst the public. He is an army Major. If he gets furious then he can drag this to any level. Just one meeting. No. Yes Kumaran? Seems like you are desperate to meet me? Evening 4 O clock. Come to the army campus. Let's meet. Hi. Kumaran. Major Sathya. Sit down. Please wait outside. I told you the other day that I can do anything I wish for. Look at me! Major! It's a power. Next, I could be a minister. Then prime minister. Well in fact... I can even become the American president. Come on Kumara! I am going to live for another 1000 years! I am immortal. In this, only life of yours... you have already seen me reincarnate 5 times. Hence, I am telling you... you better run away! Don't toil so hard and fight! Do you need an autograph? Boys! It's shocking Kumaran. I don't see any other way out. We must find out his lab! It must be destroyed ASAP! We must divide into two team Karna. We must find out the lab. Meanwhile... we must prevent him from going to the lab. One team must follow him and find out whom he is meeting. Another team must do a survey using the profiles filtered by Aadhirai. We can take help from Friends of police, detectives and retired police officers. She came into her senses just a little ago. Hence, I called you up immediately. But she went unconscious again. Can you give us any information about your husband? Madam, this is... What did she write down? She has drawn circles. That's it. Coin? Moon? - The sun? - Bangle? A ground? - Come on Karna! - A CD? Sit down. What happened? He is experiencing a trauma from an incident he fell into a well at childhood It still haunts him. What did you just say? An incident from you childhood where you fell into a well. His wife drew circles could it indicate a well? There is a well in the backyard of Dr. Pramod's house. Exactly! Let's check it immediately Karna. Sir, let's investigate. This isn't a well in the first place. Try opening it. Sir, it looks like a chamber. Karna, get it drilled along its borders. It can be arranged. Just few minutes. Few minutes. - It's open! - Not bad! Good. Wow! Major sir, isn't your life stored up here? Now I wanna see how you are gonna live for a 1000 years. An exact similar one! It is similar to the lab in the institute. He has just manipulated the structure. Otherwise it is quite similar. Wait, an important component seems to be missing. Mr. Kumaran. It's here. Wrong password It can be opened only with a password. Do you know any hackers? It is impossible to crack this one. This is a strong random password generator. The password keeps changing every five minutes. - Why are you bombarding me with calls? - Hello? Sir, it's my wife. Why do you keep calling repeatedly? What happened? Subha are you crying? The encryption is too complicated sir. Look there is no signal here. Let me call you back. A video call? Dear... just listen what I have to say. Why are you crying Subha? You better escape. Don't you get caught. Somehow make sure you save our kids. Please. - Mom! - Mom! Mom! Yeah! That's right. There is only one way out. We must find out the company that developed the Password generator. How about breaking it open? What if it explodes? Boss, this ain't a movie. Sir, this is even worse. Ajay... - Ajay! - Sir? Where is the cube box? I don't know. Officer Karna was here. Mom Sir. Sir. Please do not harm my daughters. Arm up! Fire! There are so many of you or else I would have offered something to eat. You are under arrest Major! Here is the evidence. From Dr. Pramod to his lab... ...everything has been informed to the Kernel. One second. Move! Move! Move. Major! No! Please! I've a reputation. For your sake, do not try anything cheap! Move! - Where are you going? - Move! Prepare dinner. I'll back home by night. Start the vehicle. Come on. - Clear the roads everywhere! - Ok sir. There are 12 bullets in this. I guess it should be enough? You are a Major yet why indulge in such activities? You know something. Since the time human came into existence; do you know what everyone wishes for? Immortality! We must fill diesel. Ok. Maintain a safe distance. He is very unpredictable! Where would he go next? Where would he go next? He constructed a special lab for this purpose, at the institute. Velayudham sir! He is the one who has access to the institute lab. The chase between the police force and the Major finally... ...came to an end at the Sholinganallur gas station. The fight between the police and the Major resulted in the gas station exploding. Seven people were declared... Hello. Greetings. Sit down. Please sit down. So what's up Velayudham? How are you? Are you asthmatic? - Bring him some water. - Ok sure. Where is the inhaler? If I let you alive from here then he will kill my father. Don't make any hasty decision. Who gave you this gun? Calm down and listen to me. Your brother is asthmatic. Where is his inhaler? Come on just listen to him! Brother?! Brother?! He has reached. Quick! Move! Careful. Hold on. Wait! Listen to me! No! I'll shoot you. I said no! I'll press the trigger! Come on! Now you can shoot me. But make sure you don't shoot her. Don't shoot her. Shoot me. Please. Please! Kumara! Look at me. Shoot me. Don't look at her. Come on shoot me. Shoot! Shoot! Shoot me! Kumaran. Shoot me. Shoot. Shoot me! '20 years later' (Song from 'Pudhu Pudhu Arthangal')
