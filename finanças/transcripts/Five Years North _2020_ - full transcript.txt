Radio check. With the fugitive unit, we're basically responsible for the five boroughs of New York City. What we do is we actually go out and locate at large criminal aliens. It's this one. Then there is another one in the front. Movement on the first floor. It looks like an older female. Morning, police. How are you sir? I don't want to yell. Do you mind opening the door? We're conducting an investigation. We're conducting an investigation, sir. For what? We just want to figure out who lives in the building. Somebody is using this address. Please. Hey, good morning sir. We're sorry to bother you. Okay? Hey, just give me a status every now and then. Open the door please. It was terrible. I can't even describe it. And filthy, dirty, garbage all over the place. The dog, sleeping on the floor with like his feces next to him. It was terrible. The person we're looking for wasn't there. We spoke to, I guess the primary resident on the first floor who lived there with a few other guys in some rented rooms. They finally let us in to just clear it out. But he gave us some information. I guess the person we're looking for is well known around here. He has a conviction already for a DWI. He also has a recent arrest for criminal possession of a weapon. I'm not going to tell you that we've never arrest a non-criminal. Because I'd be lying. All I can do is continue to do my job the way I'm supposed to until something changes. Your next master hearing date is, before judge. Visiting judge two. We just found out that Luis has an upcoming court hearing with an undesignated judge. Which most likely means that he will probably not have to go to court but we'll call immigration court tomorrow and find out. Right now because of Luis is under 18 years old and he's applying for special immigrant juvenile status. There is a significant chance that he'll get his special immigrant juvenile status approved. The issue arises with work permits. Immigrant children are not entitled to work permits. And there is a requirement that Luis is in school, at least up until he's 18 years old. He's going to start in my office. Okay. This is the schedule. Okay? So every day you come to school. Hi. Sorry. So Monday Sophia? - Yes, Monday. - Okay. I started with ICE in 2002. This year it'll be 16 years. It wasn't ICE when I started. It was still immigration and naturalization service. It didn't become ICE until 2003 under the department of Homeland security. I feel like this is my way of serving my country. I'm probably gonna be here until I retire. This is, this is it for me. My mother is from Cuba and my father's from Puerto Rico. They worry a lot because they are Hispanic and they're listening to, you know, Univision. So they're concerned. They don't want me to do this anymore. Okay. Today we had two subjects here from Cuba. It's kind of not my forte. They're claiming fear. They're afraid to go back to Cuba. So they are actually seeking asylum here in the United States. I have a question about that part three about the documents that provide that you are not a danger to the community. - Is that here. - Yeah. That's here so this really doesn't pertain to them because a lot of them just came. They've been in custody. So this is just if they've been arrested here. The problem here is that someone who's a criminal is in the same category of someone who's not a criminal. It's one whole big pool of people. What I would change is I probably would try to put people in different categories. In my opinion, the only way to make any of this better is the laws have to change. The immigration laws have to change and that's something that has to be done up there way above my pay grade. Are you ready? No. Let's turn our eyes this way. You can finish the front in a little bit. I need to know as much information as you have about light particles, waves, reflections, refractions and all that other stuff. So answer these two questions. You don't have to get them right. But you said pre-video. Pre-video. What does pre mean? So you might want to open up.. So we're gonna move on to the other side. We're gonna do it together. So we're going to watch the video twice. Artificial light is made when matter gives off energy in the light rays. This can happen in two ways: by heating something up until it produces light, or running an electric current through a solid, like a light bulb filament, or a gas like, neon. There are also.. There's one constant in this office. My son, Danny. Most of those photos are pretty much documenting as he was growing up. Graduation pictures, birthday pictures. I started going years ago to a Comic Con with Danny every year. And then just, every year I went, I started buying a new doll. And if you notice they're either a superhero female, or some of them are anime females, but my favorite is Wonder Woman. I have Wonder Woman at home. I have Wonder Woman all over the place. I liked the being strong and being able to handle a weapon. But my grandmother she's like the strongest person I've ever known. When things don't feel like they're going right Or you feel upset about something. You feel like you can't conquer something. She gives me inspiration. Before getting into ICE, I worked in the private sector. I was basically an accountant for a garment company for many years. And my father worked for the board of ED. My mother had a really steady job that she stayed in for over 42 years. So they were always kind of pushing me to get a job that, had stability and had benefits and all the good stuff. So they were always, you got to apply for like a city job or a government job. You gotta get something a little bit more stable. They were happy about the fact that I got a good position in the government, but they weren't happy about the fact that it was law enforcement. Tell them to sit. So it doesn't get cold. You have been warned. It is time to sit and eat. They are all gonna sit there. And I'll be sitting on my regular seat there. In a minute. The job that my mom did was very, very important for my mom. And she helps a lot of people, maybe one at a time but she really did make a difference in people's lives. At the end of the day, I do understand that these people are coming here to live a better life so I try to be considerate of that. Ain't going on? I sent you something else this morning. No I'm just being overwhelmed with these files. We got more coming. Cause I'm going through those files with Danny now. You're ready? Let's go through those files. All these cases they take a lot of work. It's not something that we just pick up and like, okay, let's go over here for this person. No, it takes a lot of database checks and research and investigating in order to have a good address just to find the person. Hello? From where? Okay. Well, where are the files? Okay hold on one second. Hello? People are constantly entering the United States. It doesn't stop. And somewhere around 2017, they stopped doing prosecutorial discretion at the court level. So they are seeing more cases now because those cases are not being administratively closed at that level. It's just such an increase in cases. To the point where you can't.. There's no way that we can, we don't have the resources to do you see all these files here? We don't have the resources officer wise to be able to go out and locate all these people. I was just curious.. No. That's completely impossible. That's completely impossible. That wouldn't even happen in a lifetime. You know what I mean? It just doesn't make any sense. There's not enough people. Even if you got every law enforcement agency involved in doing that, it just wouldn't happen. I do think to myself sometimes I wish he would actually come here. You know what I mean? Come here, get to meet people. Really look to see what we do, what it is. I wish that would happen. I know that's not going to happen either. I've said the target is a national of the Dominican Republic. He also came into the United States as a non immigrant visa. He ended up adjusting status to a local permanent resident. But then in 2017, he got convicted for conspiracy to contribute, to distribute cocaine. A federal crime. An ideal day is, going to two or three houses finding the two or three people arresting them. But it's never ever ever that simple. They already did surveillance on this twice before. Pretty much the same thing has happened. Oh, I see. Ten four I see him now. Heading there. Just check him out. I wish there were other ways of us conducting our business. Instead of doing it in somebodies home, in front of their child. We try to avoid it when we can. This guy is a working man. A real good family. Real good family guy.. He has six kids. I own the store for nine and a half years. All knew them since that time. Him and his wife, they both work. It's not like if they live off the system or nothing like that. They are working families. It's sad that things like this happens. When I first started, it was very very difficult for me. I'd see situations where I almost wanted to cry. You can't, we can't hold onto it. We can't take it home with us. We just deal with so many different cases. Those are there's no way that we could internalize our emotions on everything that we see. You kind of have to program yourself. To just think this is your job and just do your job, and do it the best way you can. And you have to separate the personal emotions or the personal feelings from doing your job. I want to ask you something. What class is he? He is in class O. But he is not here. He has attended only these. - So he's been late 12. - Yeah 12. - He's been absent 20. - 20. No, but the second term is six, right? Yeah. And he's been present 13 days. Okay. We have to write a report after each visit. So there are things that we have to make sure that we've covered. The biggest thing being their safety, medical insurance, school and of course a lawyer. If the child does not go to school, it could be considered negligence on the part of the parents or a sponsor. Here in New York, if they just decide oh no, I'm just not gonna take the child. And I would have to call Child Protective Services. I've tried calling Luis several times this morning. I was able to get in touch with him once, but he was scared and he hung up the phone. His court date was scheduled for today, 8:30. The judge that Luis has. Is particularly tough also. And she does have the authority to issue a removal order. I'm going to try calling him one more time, see if he answers by any luck and try to get him to come in. Each one of these is a new case. Actually I have them here because I haven't been able to review them. This one, I know this is a final order of removal already. You know what I mean? So once it gets here, we review the case for viability. So even though we really don't have any priorities anymore, the way we used to have a few years ago, we do try to prioritize here within ourselves. And the most important thing for us is to prioritize according to criminality, that's the way I like to run my team. What somebody does in like the middle of Montana, Fugitive Operations it may be different. Maybe they have a different mentality. I try to do the best job that I can do as an officer. I definitely think I have my own moral code. Okay. You mentioned nothing is going to work, right? I think Johnny was having trouble with it earlier, too. Cause he doesn't remember how we had everything plugged in. - That's the problem. - That's what happens. Danny is not the typical youngster. I don't think. He's a great kid. I have him working since he got his working papers when he was 14. Now he's going to be 23 years old and an adult and we're working in the same office. I never would have imagined that. Like me being in the position I'm in is kind of like a really good starting point because I'm seeing everything without actually like being out there and doing it. If he gets to get the officer job and go to the Academy and come back. We actually probably could possibly be out in the field together. And that's very weird to me. It's actually just two weeks, sometimes I'll be sitting here and he'll come here and ask me a question. And I think about it. I was like, wow, I can't believe. I thought he was gonna just, continue on his little running spree and maybe do some kind of sports orientated type of employment. But this is stability. I guess that's what's the most important. In this day and age, it's to difficult finding a job that's stable that has benefits. So for Danny to be able to get in here and to be able to establish himself and have that stability is really important. It's been important for me. And I've tried to instill that in him as well. You know, it's hard living in New York. Just it's so expensive. And sometimes you feel like, all you do is work and work and pay bills, work and pay bills. As I get a little older, I think to myself, let me move somewhere else where it's a little better cost of living or whatever. But you know, what holds me down is my family. I'm a single mother, I have one son who's like the world to me, my parents and my 109 year old grandmother. For me, they're so important. I can't imagine leaving them.
