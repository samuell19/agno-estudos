The house has remained empty for 30 years. Its curse has gone undisturbed. Tonight marks an anniversary, an ending, and a commencement into unholy ecstasy. Evaluation? Looks like the car's beat us to it. It's already fucked. I saw a house back there. Yeah. Well... Hope we don't scare them away. Dangerous-looking newlyweds seeking assistance. Guess it's unlocked. Hello. Is anybody home? Is anybody home? Guess that falls into the no category. Think there's a phone? Well, I think there's a roof. Yeah, right. I'm sure there's a bedroom. This is not exactly how I planned our wedding night, dear. Well, a bedroom and privacy are the 2 most important elements of a wedding night. I think this place will probably fit the bill. Looks like it used to be some sort of hotel. Yeah. Well, shall we check in, my love? Yes. Tell the bellboy to bring the bags up right away. Chop-chop. Chop-chop. It's wind. Well, at least we won't have to hang a "do not disturb" sign on the door. Of course not. You already are married for 2 hours, and the insults have begun. Well, this is strange. Looks like we were expected. You planned this, didn't you? Heh. Mary, I spent over 5,000 dollar for reservations on that royal oak. I can be spontaneous, but I'm not moronic. Huh. Wow... This is just fucking weird. I guess we could just curl up in the back of the car for the night. Hey... Mrs. Westlake... I promise you that this is going to be one wedding night that you will never forget. Okay? I love you. What are you doing? This properly, I hope. Your father would be so proud. No, my father would have hired 4 movers to help me. Is that a crack on my weight? Of course not. It's a crack on my father's checkbook. You are so beautiful. are you sure he didn't pitch in on this room? As far as I know... God came down and did this for us. I'm not complaining if you're not. You are so beautiful. Do you wanna get down and dirty... Or do you wanna wash up first? Well, I'm sure that there's running water right next to the phone's dial tone. Well, who knows? Suppose I should take a look, huh? Only if you promise not to go anywhere. Ha. I'll be damned. It works. All right. Can you believe it? It works. How did I guess? So, can you give me 10 minutes, and I'll make all your dreams come true? Good. I'll break out my scuba gear. Your what? Just kidding. Hurry up, my love. ...Make that 3 minutes. James, what are you doing? I'm not ready yet. James. With the lights off? I didn't know you were the old-fashioned type. Not that I'm complaining. Ooh, James, where did you learn to do that? Where did you learn to do that? Don't stop now, James. Please take me all the way. Mary? I'm readynow. Who the fuck is in bed with my wife?! Yes, give it to me! Mary! Mary?! Yes, Mr. Westlake. I am putting together a team as we speak. Dr. Donna Hemmings, an expert in paranormal activity, is flying in from Tokyo this afternoon. Anthony lees, a renowned psychic, is coming down from Boston. You might have read about him in the papers. He's helped the police on numerous occasions. And Heather Cyrus, gifted in many ways when it comes to the supernatural and the occult, is flying over from L.A. I'm meeting up with them at the hallow king manor tomorrow. If your son's wife is still inside the house, rest assured, Mr. Westlake, we will find her. We will find her. A haunting, a poltergeist? Dan, what's the scoop? Disappearance. Ooh, a spiritual abduction. Cool. This could be a blast. It could be something. Is she really part of our group? Yes, Dr. Hemmings. Miss Cyrus' approach is a bit unorthodox, but her results are impressive. Dr. Hemmings, Anthony Lees here. I've heard great things about your work. And I of yours, Mr. lees. My enthusiasm for this assignment has just tripled, Dan. Well, good. We will have to keep up appearances in case Mr. Westlake's son decides to tag along. Excuse me? Outsiders? That's highly unusual and potentially dangerous. Well, I have been trying to talk him out of it, but he does have a stake in this. It's his wife who's been abducted. I've got a feeling she's not alone. Well... Yeah, good vibrations. Anthony, are you picking anything up? Belle, what would your mother say? "No". That's why I always say yes. What do you see, Mr. lees? Young- young people in love. Dan, I'm afraid to ask, but did this place used to be a brothel? Please say yes. No, sorry. It was a bed-and-breakfast that catered mostly to couples. Honeymooners were its specialty, I believe. Well this must've been one of their open house nights. Open house nights. I'm not picking up a presence at all. That's because it's not currently happening, Dr. Hemmings. Mr. lees has the ability to tap into the past and into the future. That is his specialty. He can recall moments that happened decades ago and sometimes events that have yet to occur. I suppose it's always handy having a historian around. So, what do you do, Ms. Cyrus? I make contact. Hands-on work, dollface. That's true. Heather can get very physical on the job. Spirits are sometimes drawn to her. I send out a signal they can't resist. Mr. lees knows what I'm talking about, don'tcha? What? I'm- I'm sorry. I- I was distracted by the past. And what are your talents, if I may ask, Dr. Hemmings? If I concentrate hard enough on a mental image, I can make it happen. You're telekinetic? What a trip. Go on, move something with your mind. We have not come here to amuse ourselves with parlor games, Heather. The plan is that if indeed there are restless souls here, Mr. lees is to locate them, you are to track them, and Dr. Hemmings is to make them come out into the open so we can hopefully send them back to their final resting place. Not until I get my wife back, Mr. Marshall. Mr. Westlake, I didn't see you standing there. My wife is still trapped inside this house somewhere, and I'm not leaving until I get her back. Well, and we are here to help you accomplish that. Don't worry. Why don't we begin by you showing us where the abduction took place? You decided to spend the night here? What a romantic. It didn't look like this last weekend. This thing set a trap for us. It knew exactly what it wanted the second we set foot in this place. It wanted my wife. Please, now calm down, Mr. Westlake. Just tell us what happened, the facts. I was taking a shower, and I heard these sounds coming from the bedroom, and I came in to see what they were. Please take me all the way. I'm readynow. Then I see them moving around underneath the sheets, and then, when I pulled the covers off, they were gone. Mary! They just disappeared. This thing just pulled Mary off into the walls of this hellhole. You know, I can still hear her trying to escape. Okay, Mr. Westlake, I think we get the idea. Dr. Hemmings, would you take Mr. Westlake downstairs and get him something to drink? Yes. Please, Mr. Westlake, I think we both could use a refreshment. She's in here. She's still in here. All right? Please find her. Please. Well, Anthony, would you do the honors and see what we have? And see what we have? I'll-I'll give it a shot. Did you get something? I... No. I guess my signals got mixed up for a second. I'll try it again. Aah! No, no. Now, that goes in the third bedroom on the right. Please be careful. Careful! And hurry up, will you? The first guests will be arriving in 2 days. Everything must be perfect. Perfect! Yes. You're really going through with this, huh, mom? Now, don't you start with me, belle. I don't have the time. Didn't uncle Martin's will say specifically not to open this manor up to the public? That the curse supposedly kills people- uncle Martin was an 80-year-old, superstitious fool. I inherited this house. I can do anything I want with it. But a bed-and-breakfast is so... Romantic. Dougie and I have been quite romantic all through this house. Yeah, I don't want to hear about it. You're such a prude, mom. If I was such a prude, I would be turning this place into a nunnery instead of a honeymoon palace. According to uncle Martin's will, this place would be better off as a nunnery. If you truly believe the devil lives in the basement, why don't you just go down there and visit him? While you're at it, check the fuse box, 'cause I just changed these light bulbs. I'm going out with sue. I gotta get ready. Listen to me, you sassy little bitch, you give me 2 minutes for your poor, widowed, near-invalid mother who raised you all by herself in the wilds of Nebraska, rescued you from packs of hungry wolves and rabid dogs and horrible things- these guilt trips are getting old. Well, so am I. You wish. Please, not the crystal vase. Look out! Behind you! Aah! Hey. Doug! What are you doing here? Hunting around for those secret treasures you uncle was talking about. One last chance before the guests start arriving. Did you find any? That depends on your definition of treasure. These walls are called hollow for a reason. Hallow. It's called hallow. Hallow king manor. Whatever. Follow me. Who is this? Uncle Martin's first wife? Who knows? He's your uncle. Now, remember when you said we've probably done it in every room of this place? Well... We missed one. After you, my love. Unh! Whoa. Anthony, are you Okay? We kinda lost you there for a few minutes, buddy. Did you see something? The cellar. There's- there's something in the cellar. But we haven't been down there yet. how do you know? I know. Lead the way. I knew I wasn't alone. You like me, huh? Okay, how 'bout this- you show me something, and I show you something? You don't trust me? But I'm not a tease. What's your name? Doug. Been dead long, Doug? It's been ages. Ready for one last fling before you pass over to the afterlife? Deal, Doug. That's good. Come on. I want to feel you inside me. You will. Believe me, you will. God. God! God! Ha ha. "General Wilford Arnold. " Did you hear something? We even had a chance to consummate the marriage. Mr. Westlake? Mr. Westlake. I know this may seem a little bit blunt, but your wife's still a virgin. What the hell does that have to do with anything? We're going down into the cellar. Anthony has made a discovery. Well, where's Ms. Cyrus? God! Heather? God. Not again. God. Not again. James. James. James? James, darling. James. James, darling, I want you. My god, Mary. I knew you were here. Mary. The basement, James. I'm waiting for you in the basement. Coming, Mary. I'm coming, Mary. Is there a problem? You tell us. We heard a scream. That. I - I thought I saw a rat, but I was mistaken. So, there is something you're afraid of. There's something that frightens everyone. Something that turns them on, also. God! God. I suppose all beds have their history, huh, Anthony? Mr. Westlake knows this one better than I. Speaking of Mr. Westlake... Mary? Mary, are you down here? You're getting warmer, my love. I'm waiting for you, James. We all are. You don't think he'd be foolish enough to check out the cellar by himself, do you? Let's hope not. This can't be real. It's as real as you want it to be, James. It is you. You're real. Do you remember when we first met? That hiking trip in the woods? We made love all night. But, no, we didn't. We just fooled around a little. You said you wanted to wait until we were married. But we are married now, James. Yeah. Yeah, we are, aren't we? Mmm, James. What the- Who are they? They're with me now. If you want one of us, you have to have all of us. To prepare you for me. Did anyone hear anything in the kitchen a minute ago? Like what? Never mind. Yes. I was down here. She was over there, changing a fuse. Who was there? She was the daughter of who opened this place as a bed-and-breakfast. But that was over 30 years ago. It never opened. Her boyfriend had found a secret passageway in the wall somewhere. Over there. Your initiation is complete, James. Welcome to hell. No! He's in here. He's in that wall somewhere. Well, Donna, do you think you can... I'll try. Nice job, Donna. Anthony was right. There's a secret room. I knew it. I knew it was there. Jesus. Mr. Westlake. Mr. Westlake! He found the heart of the house. What's that on his chest? The south must make those yanks pay. I give you my bride to be, my dark lord, in exchange for victory in the great war that plagues our land. With this mark, I hereby solidify the deal. He's still alive. We should get him out of here. Definitely. We should all leave this place. At first light, we move him out of here. Donna was absolutely right. This is no place for outsiders. This room should be all right till morning. What did you see down there, Tony? We should all leave this place at dawn, leave and burn this place to the ground. It's evil, pure and simple evil. Bring on the whips and chains, I say. I think Mr. lees is slightly exaggerating, but we do need to watch our backs. Stick together in at least groups of 2. I suppose boy, girl, boy, girl is out of the question? Well, considering the history, and, sexual politics of this house, I think that would be a poor idea. Anthony and I will take the room at the end of the hallway, and I believe you 2 ladies would be best off across the corridor. I'm not afraid of the abduction suite. I could use a little action. The deal is done. No. The baby will not be born pure. This mortal has been soiled once before. You disgusted little whore. Now I'm gonna have to find another one. wilford. I think we could all use some rest. I really wish you'd tell me what you saw when you touched Mr. Westlake's chest. Dan, this ability can be a curse. Imagine knowing how your loved ones will die. Point taken. I've seen this before. No. I think this is my great-great-uncle's great-grandfather's wife. Well, he must have been great. Actually, he was a psychopath, some nut case general in the civil war. Is this cool, or what? What. This room obviously hasn't been aired out for a million years. Yeah, but sealed tight as a drum. I really had to pry that panel loose. And thank you for doing that. Can we leave now? Come on. You mean to tell me you've never wanted to do it on an altar? Girls like being put up on a pedestal, not a sacrificial altar. This is some weird shit. Ungh! Dougie! are you all right? Let me see! Let me see! Aah! I'm fine. Come to daddy, baby. Dougie, what do you think you're doing? Making love to my sacrificial lamb. Dougie! What's gotten into you? You release the animal within me, baby. Come on. We've waited long enough. You Tarzan, me Jane, huh? You're not a virgin. And the earth's not flat. Big surprise, huh? Come on. I'm not finished. Aah! Aah! Belle? Belle! You two belong to me now. No! Whoa! Anthony, are you okay? I think we should go inside. No. I don't wanna go in there. I think we should talk. Does that outfit come with A 10-year-guaranteed chastity belt, as well? Not all of us can be born nymphomaniacs, Ms. Cyrus. All right, the girl's got an attitude. I better watch my mouth, or I could find myself sleeping in a tree tonight, huh? I learned long ago not to misuse my ability. Yeah? After what happened? Donna? I'm sorry. What? Come on, you're not that innocent. You're in high school. Some preppy twit pisses you off. What did you do? Well, it only happened once. And? Nosebleed. I gave her a nosebleed using only my thoughts. Controlling the flow of blood. Mmm. You must have been popular with the boys. What are you talking about? You mean to tell me you've never had any erections spring to mind? I can't believe how your mind works. What? It works like ever other red-blooded American woman. Did you ever try it on yourself? Try what? Mental masturbation. Heather. You're really crazy, you know that? Well, if you're scared, you can try it on me. I'm always up for new experiences. I am not into women. Well, neither am I, most of the time. Hey, with that power, we don't even have to touch. This is not why we've come here. We've come here to rescue a woman who's been abducted by sexual spirits. You're right. How could using your powers in an erotic way possibly benefit the mission? What are you getting at? We already know you can arouse the living. Who says it wouldn't work on the dead? We know the spirits we're dealing with are sexually active. Your logic is starting to make sense, and that scares me. I won't tell anyone if you don't. Well, what? What do I do? You know what feels good. Just think the same sensations towards me. Only rougher. All right, but you'll tell me if something feels strange? Don't worry. I'm an audible girl. Okay. I'll start with just trying to... I feel a tickling. Tingling in my thighs. Good. That's good. Now, if I just increase the... Yeah. That feels nice. Feels like hundreds of little fingers rubbing, vibrating all over. What if I raise? Yeah. Do it harder, deeper. Let me... Man. Don't tease me. Give me everything you've got. Don't stop. It's happening. I can feel it. Don't stop. Faster. Faster. That's it. Faster. Faster. Fuck her! Fuck her to death! Aah! Once you've been corrupted, there's no turning back, my dear. There's nowhere to run. I'm already inside you. Aah! Rrr-aah! Aah! Look at him, Donna. So peaceful. So sad. You can cheer him up. You know you wanna. Just look at him, Donna. Help him take his mind off his wife. It's wrong. But it feels so right. So, you mean to tell me that general Arnold made a deal with the devil? General gives the devil a child, and in return, the devil helps the south win the war. Well, someone didn't live up to his end of the bargain. The general's virginal bride wasn't as virginal as she seemed. The devil had screwed them both. Literally. The south loses the war. General wilford Arnold commits suicide. 104 years later, 2 kids release his soul from his tomb, and he's been haunting these walls ever since. But... Why pick Mr. Westlake's wife? I mean, besides the... Striking resemblance. I think he wanted to try it again- impregnate a virgin with the devil's seed, complete the deal. So you think old scratch himself might make an appearance? No, not necessarily. See, the devil can use a host to carry his seed. Someone with the mark. Aah... Deeper! Deeper! No! No! Leave us alone! Dr. Hemmings! Please! Donna, you don't know what you're doing. The hell I don't! The hell you do! Just look! Look at who you're making love to! Aah! No! Almost there! No! Aah! No! There is no protection from the dark one! It's okay. I didn't know what I was doing. It was like I was in some sort of trance. You were. This place has been playing games with all of us ever since we got here. Okay, fuck morning. We're leaving this place right now. Where is Heather? It's got her. It's got them all- Heather, Mr. Westlake, his wife. If Mr. Westlake's wife is still a virgin, there may still be a ceremony. Reunited in hell, so to speak. That's not going to happen. 6 people walked into this house. 6 people are walking out. Hey! I think general Arnold has another plan in mind. Anthony! The door's locked! The general's trying to separate us! All right. We have our work cut out for us. We'll get you out of there, Anthony! Well, sunrise is in 3 hours, if that makes any difference. We must think straight. He already knows our weaknesses and our desires, and he's going to try to use them against us. None of us are immune. What's our plan of action? Get Anthony out of this room, find out the general's weaknesses, and then it's back to that hidden room inside the basement. Remember, it'll try to trick us and separate us. Don't be fooled by what you see and hear. The child. What? It's the child I heard earlier. It's a trick. There is no child. Ignore it. She's crying. Don't let her cry! There is no child. It's all in your mind, Donna. Do you understand me? Do you understand me, little lady? You mustn't use those powers of yours. People will think you're some kind of freak, an unholy demon! Do you understand? You are an evil child. Evil! You can't walk away from me, you little monster! Do you hear me? Do you understand? Do you understand me, Donna? Do you understand? Aah! Donna, come back here. Donna! Come back! You know we're not so different, you and I. I never fit in, either. Why don't you join the party, Donna? No! Damn. I'm gonna check the foyer. You check the dining room. You check the dining room. Donna? Don't be afraid. We're not gonna hurt you. Donna? Aah! I'm coming, Mary. It's time! Tony, don't be afraid. We're not gonna hurt you. Heather. You know, I was attracted to you from the moment I first saw you. History can be so revealing. Heather, you're under the control of the general. Y- you don't know what you're doing. But I know what I'm feeling. I'm curious. Can you tell me my history? Enjoying the past? And the future. Now it's my turn. Let me predict the future. Let's enjoy it together. You are not taking my team. I'm the one in control here. Your time is long past. The war is over, and you lost, general. You lost. Aah! Ha! Just the first round, son, but I'm coming back with a vengeance! Aah! See? The future can be beautiful. What? Who? See? It's a huge place. Great for raising a family. Who is it? And if you like giving dinner parties... What? What's the matter? Don't you see them? But they can't see us. They're in the future. It is impressive. But the background on this place. All just rumors and myths. No one's lived here since 1968. It was just a freak accident. A girl fell in the basement, broke her neck. Tragedy? Yes. Ghost? No. What about those paranormal investigators that supposedly came through here? Yes, and rumored to have all disappeared without a trace? That was over a year ago. I think it was just a publicity stunt. And no proof can be found to support supernatural activity. Stage a vanishing. It's media hype. Personally, I don't think they were ever even here. Nobody ever found any traces of them. Well, come on. Let me show you to the upstairs... Where are you going? Wait! I'm alive! I'm right here! I'm not dead! I'm not dead! I'm sorry. I was a bad girl. It was an accident. I didn't mean to use my powers. I promise I won't ever use them again. No! That's Okay, Donna. You're forgiven. Now, hurry up. They're waiting for us at the party. Come. Meet the other guests. Mary, well, look at you. The belle of the ball. Traci, you know how I am about compliments. This isn't real. This can't be happening. But it is, Donna. And your friends, they've already arrived. The dark one appreciates previews before the main attraction. It puts him in the mood. Time for our guest of honor! Run, Donna! Save yourself! No! W- w-what did he do? She broke the clock. She broke the spell. Is that possible? Can one object hold all of the spirit's power? A single object has been known to be the catalyst of many hauntings in the past. Of many hauntings in the past. It works as sort of a- an antenna for a supernatural transmitter. Destroy the antenna- and the object becomes inoperative. I don't think it's over. She's right. I still feel the vibrations. We must find Mr. Westlake and his wife. It's begun! Where? In the heart of the house, where his power is still the strongest. In the cellar. In his room in the cellar. I don't think he wants us there. Well, tough shit! I'm ready for battle. how 'bout you guys? Go. It has been 134 years, my lord, but I'm about to live up to my side of the bargain. Have your child, and allow me the freedom to travel beyond these walls to seek more vengeance on all the yankee traitors from here to eternity. Beware of the minions. What are they, rats? Faithful servants of the general's. Enslaved souls unleashed to deceive us. Then we're banish the general's spirits and free all the souls in the process. Something like that, yeah. Freeing spirits that don't want to go is not my field. We need something personal, right, like their ashes and holy water. Like their ashes and holy water. We have this. Good. Let's evaporate that bastard. The time has finally arrived, my patient friends. You must now be bound in unholy matrimony. Disrobe... And come to the altar of life and death. I will not disappoint you this time, my love. Who's there? I'll flush it out. Donna. Mom? What did I tell you about using those evil powers of yours? You ungrateful little brat! You're a disgrace to the entire family! You are not real! I'm grown up now. I don't have to take your shit anymore! Inner demons. I can handle it. Let's move on. Do you hear that? They've begun. Let's get out of here. Once I am free... My power will know no bounds. And you two are gonna be my assistants every step of the way. Slaves for eternity. Slaves for eternity. If we don't get in here soon, it'll be too late. With all the damn spirits in this place, you'd think at least one would be on our side. That's it. If we can't move the stones, we can move the souls inside the stones. Heather, I need you to try to contact the spirits while I attempt to draw them out. Yeah. Yeah. Give me a child, my dark lord. Mmm... Mary, reclaim your property. Where do you think you're going? No! Stop! This isn't how I pictured it. Don't stop. The seed must be planted. No. Stop! James, what are you doing? Makin' babies, my dear. Now is the time to leave this world and move on to the next. And my husband, the general? He'll be along in a minute. Thank you. Stage one complete. Now it gets tricky. I didn't need to hear that. After you, ladies. You're too kind. They're coming! They're coming through! Stop them! Nothing must interfere with the procreation! I think we're almost there. You don't know what you're doing! Hey, I'm not that kind of a girl anymore, bud. Let me show you your eternal future if this child is born. Nobody likes being a slave. No! No! That's it. Unleash the seeds and create a whole new world. Aaah! Don't! Now finish the job. Stop. No. No. Don't worry, I'll finish him off for you. What are you doing to him?! Once corrupted, there's no turning back. Remember, general? By possessing Heather, you taught me something really useful. No, you must not waste the lord's seed, or there's gonna be hell to- 3 strikes, and you're out, general. I can't hold on. You! You ruined everything. I will have your head! Three failures, general. I think you know what that means. Your soul is mine. No. No. Give me one more chance. I know I can succeed this time. Let's go back to my place and discuss it. James? James. What happened? God, don't ask me. Now, who taught you how to do that? Look, can we just get out of here? This place gives me the creeps. The party's over. Hallow king manor, undisturbed for over 30 years... Restless no more. Now on the market at a reasonable price. A bit of a fer-upper, but has a strong foundation and a wonderful antique clock that can miraculously still tell time.
