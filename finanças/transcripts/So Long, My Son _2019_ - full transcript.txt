Let's go downstairs and play. I'll take care of you. I can't swim. We'll play on the edge, the water is not deep! I'll take care of you. Come with me. Come with me. Shall I leave you here? I'm going to go. Here I am! Here I am! - I'm here. I'm here. - There you are, Xingxing. Wash your hands and sit at the table. With soap. Wash them well. Help yourself. Do you want some eggs? I've done five. - Do you want some? - No, I'm having a drink first. - How was school? How was school? - Very well. Peanuts? I'll give you three. Xingxing! Xingxing! Let's take him to the emergency room! Haohao! SILENCE Where's the kid? Where's the kid? Upstairs. I already told him to come down. He's playing his video game. Go get it. Go get it. Let's eat. Eat. Let's go to his school tomorrow. If this continues, he'll still have to change schools. This kid's pretty withdrawn. He's a loner. We brought you here to find a way to solve the problem. I can't believe it. Professor, I would like to that you investigate a little more. If you want, but you might make it worse, which would be worse for Xingxing. Take my advice. Take him home with you and have a conversation with him to convince him to return the object. Keep it between schoolmates. Reprimand him and teach him a lesson, so that he doesn't commit any more crimes this kind of fault, and that's enough. Yaojun.... Explain yourself. They harass me, I take revenge. Who harassed you? Them. They harass you, so you steal. You think that's smart? I didn't steal. It's not me. It's not me. So what is this, then? I hate this place. I hate them. I hate you. I hate you. Xingxing! You want to play the big guy? Perfect. We're going to solve this like men. Don't worry, I won't hit you. I'm giving you a choice. Either... you return what you stole and you apologize. Either... we'll take you to the police station. All right, so take me to the police station. Very well. As you wish. First apologize to your mother. Let go of me first. Yaojun, let go of him. Yaojun! Xingxing.... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I disappointed you. Why did you do that? Where this kid could he have gone into hiding? Pretend he's dead. How can you say such a thing... after raising him all these years? What do you want me to say? We fed him, we clothed him... You spoiled him too much. What do you think? That he'll take care of you later? He's a ungrateful little bastard! It looks like Xingxing, but it's not him. Our Xingxing is dead. Gone. Xingxing and Haohao are celebrating their birthdays! White Rabbit" candies from Shanghai for your birthday. The box will go to the winner of rock-sheet-scissors. Scissors cut paper! Happy birthday to both of you! Let's move on to the cake. You were waiting for the birthday cake? There's the cake! With roses! - What about the candle? - There she is. I'm lighting the candle! Blow together! Loans.... Get out of here! Happy birthday to you! Our boys were born on the same day of the same year. If it had been a boy and a girl, we would have married them. That's a pity. That's the way it should be. They are like brothers. Like the two of us. Friends' sons are brothers. Heaven did it right. That our children to be brothers for life. Yaojun, I'm going. I'm finishing my play. - Liyun, are you all right? - It's nothing. It's nothing. Take over for a minute. Lie down. Lie down. Make sure you get under the duvet. Try to avoid Haiyan. I can't hide it from him. for a long time. And then what? We'll come up with an idea. There are solutions. What kind of solution? It'll show up soon. Today, I almost fainted in the workshop. Is it that bad? So.... we're taking sick leave, and we hide in the village at my aunt's house. We'll pay the fine! I have an idea for the nickname of our second: "Fine". There's nothing to joke about. In addition to the fine, we'll lose our jobs. Didn't you hear Haiyan? Birth control is worse in the countryside. There's Liu. Come and have a cup of tea with us. You worked hard. Sit down. Sit down. Say, is your son back? What kind of tea is that? Why are you talking to him about this? All kids that age are a problem. Primarily boys. Boys or girls, only children are treasures. Change the subject. - Get him some tea. - Let's talk about something else. There's Mrs. Liu. Come and have a cup of tea! - Come and have a cup of tea. - No, thank you, no way. Come and eat, Yaojun. Some other time. I'll see you later. See you soon. You could still have avoided to gaffer. Everyone goes to Canton to make money, but they came in this hellhole. I hear that the kid is not their son. Is that true? It all makes sense. I'm going back to the police station. You're wasting your time. If there's anything new, they'll let us know. If we don't push them, they won't do anything. The orphanage called. He can obtain his identity papers if it is registered with us. I talked to my sister, she can take care of it. It doesn't matter, as long as he comes back. I can't hear you! Who? Who? Tomorrow, I'll go to town for supplies. I'll go to the newspaper. put out an APB. Can I get you anything? I don't need anything. DAILY EDITIONS OF FUJIAN You've aged. Are you here on business? I didn't want to go on the trip, but I remembered that you lived here. I wanted to see you again. before going abroad. How did you know we lived here? Did you think you could disappear? We always knew where you were. You first went to Hainan, and soon after that, you came here. We were wondering where you'd go next, we were surprised that you stayed here. We have nowhere else to go. It's good here. We don't know anyone, we don't have the same way of life, we don't understand the dialect. It's like being abroad. Almost. Is Liyun all right? Very well. As she says: "Time has stopped. "We have nothing left to do than to wait for old age." How is your brother and his family? How to say... Haohao is in college, in the second year. My brother is... always busy with his business. Haiyan has taken early retirement, she enjoys life. When they found out I was coming here, they asked me to say hello. That's good. That's good. You said you were going abroad? Yes. What I learned in college seemed to me more and more outdated. I passed the TOEFL, and I got it. As soon as I get back, I'll quit. - And your... - We got divorced. As clever as you are than when you were a kid. You even guess my questions. I was your apprentice. For a few days of training only. It's partly because of you. that I was able to go to college. You weren't a good apprentice! That's true. It's okay. It's okay. The hand stays there. Don't be afraid. Higher up. Change hands. Freeze! Freeze! Hold it right there. The pose you have here is that of a fashionable dance, the rumba. The couple is glued together like that. So? Yaojun, do you have an apprentice? Listen, Moli: learn the technique with him, but for fashion, learn from Master Xinjian. Don't you think I look like to a Hong Kong star? Your pants are sweeping the floor. Should I sweep? Perfect! Perfect! Western style! "Romantic Encounter "in Hong Kong". Very beautiful! Yaojun.... Tonight, there's a hell of a party. A "party".... Disgusting! Get the hell out of here! You're too much of a hick. Moli, shall we go together? Get the hell out of here! You're hitting me, too? Is this a new dance? Yes, the jitterburg. Who is there? Who is there? Me! Me! Haiyan? Open up! Open up! Sister-in-law... come in quickly. Come in quickly, brother! Close the door! Stop it! Stop it! What? What? That filthy music! Since you became an executive, you want to get involved in everything. - Stop it. Stop it. - The beard! Leave it alone! Watch out for the tape! I brought him from Canton! Listen, Meiyu. Put on something discreet. You're exaggerating. How do old friends get to know each other? could they forget The happy moments of the past How do old friends could they forget The happy moments of the past It's a beautiful song. What's her name? "This is just goodbye." Have you ever heard it before? When we were "educated young people" in the countryside. During the Cultural Revolution? You don't know anything. Meiyu, good choice. Good point. Was it in'77 or'78? End of'78. Educated young people wanted to go back to the city. Some were able to do it, others were not. When we were separating, it was a real goodbye. When we left, someone sang this song to us. We started crying. It wasn't the style of the time. Right, Yingming? Yes. Unforgettable. with the Minister of Security: "The increase in crimes and offences " is very unpopular. "Let's launch an anti-crime campaign after the other!" Yaojun! Yingming? Yaojun, my brother is asking for you. The resolution of the Central Committee for the repression of crimes and offences plan three campaigns in three years. Police bodies commit to implement the watchword for policing: applying the law promptly and severely. Go get your son. at his grandparents' house. But no, no, no. I'm staying here. There you are. - Is he asleep? - He just fell asleep. The whole factory is talking about it. What happened? What happened? Xinjian was arrested in a party of "dancing in the dark". Because he was dancing? For the anti-crime campaign, these parties are incitement to debauchery. Some have even been shot. And Meiyu? We don't know. We didn't find her. You haven't seen her? No. She didn't come to work? No. Where can she be? Where can she be? That's terrible. Meiyu is back. - Is she here? Is she here? - I just saw her. Let's go see her. Come with us. I'm in town. My truck broke down. I fixed it. I'll load my packages and go home. Don't wait for me. Yes. Didn't you tell him I was here? There you are. Have you eaten? Yes. Go to bed. I'm unloading the truck. Comrades members of the Party and the Communist Youth! To achieve the objective of a contained population to 1.2 billion at the end of the century, The State Council calls couples to have only one child. This measure engages the future and the rhythm of the Four Modernizations, health and happiness for future generations, as well as the national interest in the short and long term. The Central Committee asks to Party members, and in particular to executives, to actively implement the call of the State, and to ensure with patience with the masses their propaganda work and education. What's the matter? What's the matter? I compliment you! Are you being the one who doesn't know? Liyun told me everything. How many months again? You're not ashamed of yourself. for acting to me? All right. There's no need for an epilogue. I called the hospital, The ambulance is coming. we'll go together, okay? What's the matter with you? We're going home! Yaojun.... Did you think you could hide forever? Liyun, you did enough nonsense as it is. And you've been thinking, before you hide something like that? What if it gets out in the factory? Have you thought about the consequences for me? Can you imagine? Director.... Come in. Come in. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Yaojun! Calm down! Calm down! Hold him back! Hold him back! Stop it! Stop it! You should be ashamed of yourself! Get in. - Liu Yaojun! - It's okay! It's okay! I'm coming with you. On the way. This way. This way. - Director. - Dr. Yang. Wang Liyun, from the sorting workshop. She admitted her mistake. Well, let's start with a blood test. Liyun, Don't worry, it'll be over soon. Everything is planned. Don't worry about it. I'm here. I'm here. Go. SILENCE Dr. Yang! - I'm here. I'm here. - Come on, she's bleeding out. What's going on? What's going on? Come and have a look. - Who are you? Who are you? - Her husband. Wait outside, we'll operate. - Calm down! Calm down! - What's going on? What's going on? Calm down. Calm down. He's in surgery. We are the continuators and heirs of communism Walking in glorious footsteps of the pioneers of the revolution we love the people Proud to bear the name of Young Pioneers Hi! Hi! At ease! At ease! Walk! Walk! Now we are putting back the last price of the day, the annual Advanced Activist Award of Birth Control. The Director of the Planning Bureau family, comrade Li Haiyan will announce the names of the winning couple. Our factory has done a good job to birth control, with zero unplanned pregnancies in our couples. An example for the local population. In addition to the excellent behaviour of the Party members, the level of mass consciousness has risen. Even if some comrades had to fight their reluctance, our careful ideological work allowed them to to respond to the call of the state. Here are the winners the Advanced Activist Award of Birth Control for 1986. The winning couple is.... Wang Liyun from the sorting workshop! And Liu Yaojun from the assembly workshop! Congratulations. Don't make that face. There's a bonus with it. Smile. Smile. Meiyu has really decided to go to Canton? Why are you so surprised? Today, those with ambition go to Canton. I admire her, she has guts. What about you? Would you like an IUD? No need to. According to the doctor, the wall of the uterus is thin, and the operation had after-effects. I can no longer be pregnant. This is all Yaojun's fault. He agreed to the vasectomy, but he sent someone in his place. Yet, from the look of it, you'd think he was honest. Honest? He's just stupid. There you are at last, Yaojun. - Are you back? - I have to do an internship again. Are you there, are you? Where's Mommy? She's over there. I learned the waltz. Are you dancing with me? Your brother dances better than me. He dances with Meiyu, look! Take this, my son. Go play. Soon to graduate? Time passes quickly. That's true. You've grown again. I barely recognize you. Do you have a boyfriend? Would you like to? What do you mean? I am interested in my apprentice's life. None of the boys in the school I don't like it. Be careful not to end up like Meiyu. Meiyu is waiting for someone. Who? Xinjian? Yes ! She's an idiot. In love, women are stupid. Not wrong. Look at her: all in the forms, nothing in the head. Is he still mad at me? But no, no, no. He blames himself. He thinks he's a failure to do anything. I wish you wouldn't leave That you stay with me Why do you have to leave And leave me to my loneliness Each meeting is too brief And you stay silent Each goodbye when you leave Break my heart of sadness How to survive these nights of loneliness Don't leave me in doubt anymore We are young We are full of life We are full of life It doesn't matter what the ups and downs are Don't sigh Don't despair It's up to you alone what your success depends on Look at the happy moments Wing pull thread Enjoy them before it's too late You all came.... I'm very well. The government has been lenient. No mistreatment or anything. And you, are you all right? Everything is fine for us. Yingming joined the Party. Haiyan is a civil servant. Director. Assistant. Liyun and Yaojun are "model couples". No choice. I'm going to take my chances in the south. That's good. That's good. Let's go home. One more game. That's enough. That's enough. I'm taking you to another place. Shall we go in? Not me. I'm going to go. Xingxing, come on! It's too dark, I'm not going. It's funny, come on! I don't want to. Haohao! Haohao! I'm on my way. - You scared me! You scared me! - You coward! It's too dark, let's go out. This way! This way! Where is the story of the layoffs? We don't know anything, everyone's scared. We don't even know who decides anymore. Every time I ask the director, he looks at me wrong. And he says that a "model woman" must set an example. As if I wanted to be a role model! Why bring up this story of family planning? It's painful. Screw him! I say it's Yingming who was smart. He started his own business. - I'm sorry I'm late. - Come in, Haiyan. Did you have dinner? I can warm something up for you. No, I'm taking Haohao to his grandmother's. - Haohao, let's go. - I'm not finished yet. Hurry up! Hurry up! They don't know when to stop. Liyun, don't you know? They took a family who was hiding in the village. She was seven months pregnant! What they thought of, to hurt himself like that? Say goodbye. - Goodbye, godmother. - Goodbye, Haohao. Let's get going. See you soon. Comrades! Today's meeting is of an exceptional nature. It's not a ceremony, nor the annual report. These are the decisions that are essential in any life. Every crisis comes with an opportunity. I am aware that I am aware that this meeting involves the vital interests of everyone. "Pull a single hair makes the whole body move." Everyone has their share of the nation's destiny. No one can ignore what his country is going through. "Weep for the nation before crying over you." Cry yourself! Comrades! Admirable feelings from our ancestors! Let's compare. The country is in trouble! What difficulties? The enemy is at our doorstep, what is the duty of our soldiers? What can they do? What does that mean? They sacrifice without hesitation their blood and their lives, they die in Flanders fields to protect the country. Comrades, listen to me. I now come to us. Our plant suffers from high loads. The numbers are overwhelming. We are overwhelmed by the load. What to do about it? What to do about it? You're a useless man! We must sacrifice our guaranteed positions to ease this burden. Losing your job is not a shame, to work again is all the more glorious! Therefore, some will have to sacrifice themselves and look for a job elsewhere. We went in in the market economy. The status of our industries has changed. This is the end of the "iron rice bowl"! We're not getting fired! Comrades! Losing your job is not shameful rework is all the more glorious for it! No to dismissals! If you don't laze around, if you roll up your sleeves, you will still contribute to the construction of socialism. We want to work! Comrades, think about it. Ask yourself in all conscience: "To help the country, everyone has their share. Who has to leave, if not me?" You! You! Quiet! Quiet! Resignation! Resignation! Enough, comrades! I will read out in the list of deleted items. "The phoenix perishes in the flames and rises from the ashes." I will read to you.... the list of deleted items. Quiet, please! Quiet! Sorting workshop: Zhang Yan.... - Do you accept that? - No! No! No! Huo Jianguo.... Quiet! Quiet! Feng Xiaobo. Yu Yonggang. Wang Tianquan. Wang Liyun. We're not leaving! I don't dare to decide alone. I told you on the phone.... - This one time only.... - I knew it.... I had just got my American visa. Life knows how to make fun of us. Did you tell your brother? Said what? That I'm pregnant of you? This is the very beginning. Don't worry about it. We are not children. Talk to Liyun about it. I'm staying here for a few days. I know what this means to you. If you want to keep the child, I'll go to America. after the birth. Have you thought about yourself? Don't worry about me. I've been thinking. If it's my destiny, I will pay my family's debt. The debt? This is not about debt. It's.... Think about the child. Deprived of his mother from birth. Liyun will be a better mother than I am. What does Liyun have to do... That's not the point. Don't say it's mine. I await your decision. Tell Liyun it's someone else's. It's my fault. It's my fault. I was the one who went to you. I can't pretend otherwise. When you left, I thought about following you. But I was too young. I couldn't stand it. to see you suffer. But this time, I knew what I was doing. I was thinking that after I left, I would never have seen you again. I'm not that young anymore. I didn't think so.... I should be happy about that. But... now that I'm here, I'm suddenly very scared. I wanted to tell Liyun, hoping that she would understand and that she forgives. Excuse me, Yaojun. Am I still a kid? Missing person: Liu Xingxing It's weird.... What? What? When I went into town, I saw a woman on the ferry. Obviously not from here. A familiar face.... but I can't remember. It happens sometimes. It was like.... when we got here. Like finding a previous life again. That's true. I thought to myself.... One day.... I will die. It will be here or in our hometown? We agreed on that. not to talk about this. If I lost you too, how could I live? What's the matter with you? Yaojun, if you want a divorce, I will accept it. I don't know, I don't know. if it was the sixth sense of femininity.... Yes. I felt the feeling that I was being watched from the other ferry. I didn't dare look. Liyun and I no longer live than for each other. Especially Liyun. She wouldn't survive another blow. But you wanted a child so much... Because he would have been our child. If we do as you say, I'll hurt three people. To Liyun. To the child. And to you. I understand. It must be my fate. I am resigned to it. Xingxing! Let's take him to the emergency room! Haohao! Whose idea was it? Speak! Speak! How many times have I told you not to go to the dam? Why did you disobey? Why? Why? It was Xingxing's idea, or did you take him away? Speak! Speak! Speak... It's my fault! It's my fault! You will not eat until you talk to me. How many times have I told you not to play at the roadblock! What happened? What happened? Stop crying. Stop crying. I don't want to hear from you! What are you yelling about? Do you want the neighbors to hear you? By dint of screaming, you terrorized that kid. What are we going to do? The boy is terrified. No matter what you ask him, he remains mute. The day before yesterday, he was sent at his grandparents' house. He was taken out of school. Don't tell him anything. If he asks after Xingxing, say he's at his grandmother's house. It's Haohao's fault. I told him a hundred times: "Don't take Xingxing to the dam." Enough. Enough. They are children. It's not their fault. It's mine. It's mine. I tend to pass everything on to Haohao. - I'm gonna kick his ass! - Stop it. Stop it. I'm tired, I'm tired. Get some rest. We're going to go home. Good morning, Mr. Director.... Take care of yourself. Aren't they ashamed to come? Enough. Enough. What can we do about it? He was their only child. He might not have been the only one. What do you mean? You know very well. Repeat to see! That's enough. That's enough. Pretty, what's the point of saying that? I feel sorry for Yaojun and Liyun. What are you implying? That it's my fault? Don't take it out on me! What did I do? What did I do? Explain yourself! That's enough. That's enough. Stop arguing. The kid's next door. Do you want something to eat? What's the matter? What's the matter? Do you have a stomachache? Don't cry, we're going home. It's the fever. that makes him say anything. That can't be true. Isn't that right? He's completely terrified. - He's in shock. - That's it, that's it. Maybe it's..... nervous tension. What are we going to do? Go to sleep. Don't cry anymore. Listen to me. Listen to me. Let's never talk about this story again. in front of the kid. But in Yaojun and Liyun.... what will we say? It's unforgivable.... Don't even try it! Thank you, ma'am. Eat your food. Xingxing, come over here a little bit. Eat your food. Xingxing, Are they from your school? No. Who are they? Who are they? Friends. Any friends? Don't they go to school? No. They are like me. Xingxing, you know how long it takes Have we been looking for you? You do who proud, by behaving like that? To no one. The BOLO said I have papers. Leave it. That's the way it is. We'll get out of this too. Since you've made up your mind, we can't hold you back. Here's the promised ID card. And money. Not much. Don't waste it. These papers make you an adult able to prove his identity. They will allow you to work and to avoid us to worry about us. Mom and Dad thank you. For years, we made you Xingxing. And you became Xingxing to make us happy. Today, we want to give you back your true identity. Zhou Yongfu. One last piece of advice. If you do anything stupid, remember from when I was hitting you. Cute? Yaojun. It's you. It's you. Come in, it's cold. Liyun? Moli is here. Come and sit down. My brother and Haiyan made you ravioli. Sit down. Sit down. It's been a long time.... Hot water. Warm up. Have you eaten? Can I warm up some ravioli for you? No, don't bother. Meiyu and Xinjian are here. They came to see us. It is a question of that we meet tomorrow night. I said I'd come by and invite you. You'll be better off with each other. Thank you. Xinjian finally married Meiyu. I was sure of it, the day he went to meet her in Hainan. It's the Solstice Festival. Liyun, the ravioli are flavoured with fennel. According to my brother, your favorites. Have some more water. It's hot.... Are you all right? And you? It's going very well. Very well. Haiyan! Haiyan! Happy New Year! Say hello! "Hello, godmother"! Treasure! Say "Auntie". "Godmother"! - Are you all right, Xinjian? - Very well. Meiyu, you're all red! Is Haiyan all right? She doesn't sleep well. She keeps repeating that people are saying bad things about her behind his back. This is worrying. She needs to rest. I convinced her to resign. We have the means. We'll do without his three cents. So since then.... you don't see them anymore? I went to see them. They were very polite. But we didn't know what to say to each other. Before.... we got along so well.... Haiyan.... Liyun and Yaojun don't blame you. This whole child thing, it's long gone. Don't think about it anymore. We have to get past this and move on. You don't understand, stop it. Yes, I do understand. You shouldn't be so angry with yourself. That was your job. You had no choice. Stop it... Liyun! A doctor! A doctor! Dr. Shen, I'll be direct. According to the tests, his condition is not very good. The diagnosis is obvious. I see. If you want to keep her in the hospital, I'll prepare whatever it takes. It's no use. Don't tell him, I'll take care of it. Is it that bad? It could happen at any time, if she has another seizure. And an operation? No. The tumor has grown larger and compresses the nerves. A malignant tumor. Doesn't your mother know? Not yet. Why do you let her cooking? Let me do it. Let me do it. No, it's all right, just rest... - Mom, let us do it. - But no, no, no. - Are you dizzy? - Not at all. I've been sleeping all day! Baby.... Come on, come on, come on. Go ahead. Go get some rest. Eat your food. Thank you. I don't know what's happening to me. Guess who I'm dreaming of. From whom? From whom? From Liyun and Yaojun. Who? Who? You don't know them. My godfather and godmother. You never told me about them. I've dreamt of them too. What does that mean? Nothing, it's a dream. No. I think to myself that if I were to die tomorrow, I wouldn't have seen them again. only once before he died.... What are you talking about? After all these years, they probably forgot about us. Impossible. I'm going to work. Obey the doctor: dance steps and no sports. Rest during the day. I'm going to go. Take your medication. You kept in touch with them, didn't you? Moli went to see them before you leave. I have their number. But I never called. Call them. Invite them to my birthday party. We'll pay for their trip. Are you sure about that? Call and tell them that I'm about to die. And that before you leave, I would like to see them again. Don't talk nonsense. I want them to know that that for 20 years.... I, Li Haiyan.... I haven't lived for a moment without thinking about them. Ladies and gentlemen, we are experiencing turbulence. Please go to your seats and fasten your seat belts. Thank you for not leaving your seats. Children must stay with their parents. Thank you That's funny. We're still afraid of dying. Passengers of flight CA 272 to Beijing are requested to register, and to arrive with their luggage at terminal n? 5. Aren't you cold? It's all right. It's good, the cold. Since time immemorial that we didn't feel the cold.... And your boy.... still no news? Who? Who? No. He should renew his papers. Yes. To get the ID card of the "2nd generation". My sister, Does your husband know we're here? Not yet. He gets anxious over nothing. I don't recognize anything anymore. The street is wider. The building across the street was demolished. This is all new. Let me do it. Let me do it. Everything has changed. Wait for me. Wait for me. Thank you. Our building has not changed. We're talking about tearing it down. for years, but nothing happens. Is it still inhabited? Some of them have left, others have sublet. No one cares anymore workers' housing. In the other buildings, there's gas and cable, but not in yours. It is almost uninhabited, we're talking about tearing it down, so nobody does anything. In winter, when the heating is on, I'm here to purge the radiators. The heating doesn't work very well anymore. I wanted to tidy up and clean up the apartment and buy you a radiator or a duvet... MASSAGE ROOM But I preferred to wait that you decide for yourself. If it's too hard to be here, you will come to us. Thank you, sister-in-law. My son... Excuse me, Li Haiyan's room? Li Haiyan? Room 11, down the hall. Thank you. - Aren't we too late? - No. No. Xinjian..... Yingming.... Haohao, come on. Say hello to the godfather and godmother. What a big boy.... Godfather. Haohao.

See you soon, make sure you get home okay. Take good care of yourself. Go home safe. See you soon. - Have you been drinking? - With everyone. Old friends from the factory. All in good shape, not a white hair. You and Liyun should stay a few days. The city has changed a lot. Yes, don't leave. You have to have a good time before you get too old. There is no going back. Why not? Why not? Yingming could have you an apartment. What are you plotting? you two? Yaojun says that he can't come back here. I'm saying you could get them one of the houses you're building. That's no problem. Haiyan kept telling me about it. These days, I'll take you to visit my accommodations, and if you like it, I'll find you a nice one. What if we can't afford it? Where is Haohao? He was here a minute ago. He must be in the bathroom. I'll check it out. Don't move. Don't move. I'm going to go. Stay there. Stay there. When are you having the baby? Soon. Haiyan didn't know him.... Have you thought this through? All this.... has tormented us for too long. I don't want to be like my mother, in guilt until the end. This story between our families is not your fault. and we can't blame your mother. I know. I know. No one is accusing Mom. That was his job, wasn't it? I know very well what she thought of it in the background. So.... should I call them? No. Later, I'll walk them home. Do you want me to come with you? No. It's changed a lot. Where are we now? Where are we? This was the Place du Premier mai, and there, the Avenue de la Jeunesse. We just passed through in front of the former Convention Centre. They demolished it? Of course. Many workers' cities have been demolished. There is practically no time left than the one we were living in. Not even. There's nothing left. This is it. This is it. Thank you, Haohao. Godmother.... can I come up for a moment? Of course! Of course! Pull over here. We could have lived in a house at Yaojun's sister's house, but we hadn't come back. for so long, that we preferred to spend a few days here. Do you recognize a little bit of what it was like? Come in quickly. I'll get you some water. With tea. Do you recognize it? Everything is as it was before. Just like we left it when we left. We're only here for a few days, so we didn't touch anything. The same old furniture, the same old devices. I pulled out that picture like that, when I put away.... Haohao, sit down. Drink your tea. Have you put enough tea in? If I put more, it'll be bitter. Godmother, sponsor.... Sit down, please, I have something to tell you. We are listening to you. What I'm about to say has been weighing on me for years. Now that my mother's death has brought us together, I think so. that I have to tell you everything. That day, we decided to go to the dam. At first, we said that we would go play by the waterfront with the others. But Xingxing didn't want to go anymore. I got angry, and I left him alone. But now.... the other children laughed at him. I was humiliated. I told Xingxing.... I said, "If you don't come, "I'll never play with you again." Xingxing gave in. We were having fun.... and then some of them went swimming further. I wanted to take Xingxing with me, but he... he was afraid. So.... I dragged him by force. to the inside of the tank. Xingxing panicked. He was screaming, he was holding on to me. The others laughed at me. It made me angry... So I have it.... I pushed him. I pushed him into the water. And your parents, what did they say? Since you weren't saying anything, to protect me, they didn't say anything either. In the hope that that over time, as we grow up, I would forget. But... since that day, I had the feeling that that a tree was growing inside me. I was growing up, and the tree was growing too. I had the impression that he was going to end up tearing my body apart. I couldn't take it anymore. I had to tell you the truth. You did well to speak, my child. You did the right thing. Execute that little bastard. A life for a life. You're crazy! You're crazy! Yingming, listen to me carefully. As of today, we'll never tell Haohao about it again. Not a word. Do you understand? You and Haiyan, you will never accuse your son again. In your whole life, not another word. Xingxing is gone. We must all love and protect Haohao. He's just a child. If you don't talk about it anymore, he'll forget. Wait. Wait. We'll clear the brush first. My son... Mom and Dad came to see you. Haohao? Good! Good! All right.... See you soon. Her baby? Yes. Boy or girl? A boy! A boy! A little guy! That's good. That's good. Godfather, godmother, come in. Congratulations, Yingming. Why all these gifts? To celebrate the grandfather! There's Auntie. He's smiling! Go to Auntie's arms. Does he have a first name? They refused all the first names that I have proposed. He's chubby. Let's call him Dudu. That's cute! Aunt, can you see us? Look who's here. Nice! Nice! Can you recognize old people? Don't you think that I haven't changed? Liyun, you're here too. Cute, you haven't changed. Still as young as ever. I've aged anyway! Are you all right? Very good. - Moli, where's Sunny? - I call him. One second. Sunny? Who is it? Who is it? - Moli's son. - What a surprise, huh? She said she didn't want to have children, there she is with a big boy! Yes, people change. There he is. Do you remember me? "Hello, everybody!" "Hello! How do you do you do?" Sunny, right? Hello, Sunny. Look... Look who's here. He'll call you "uncle". Your grand-nephew Dudu. - She is his great-aunt. - Great-aunt. You see, Moli, we're all grannies.
