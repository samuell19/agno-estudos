Now get that image clear in your head and think, what did you do about it? Now when you tell a group, I'd like you to try as much as possible to recapture some of the feelings that you had at the time it was happening. Bill, could we start with you? - Well, what is it that you want? The, the circumstances of it? - Yes, but especially the feelings you had at the time it was happening, and what you did about it. I'll give you a little more time, okay.? Chris, how about you? - Um, my father, he got me a job in Covina. I don't have a car. My mother won't drive me, so I went to my father. Is this right, is this how you do it here? Just like this? Well okay, so I went to my father, and he said to me, "Christine, I'll get you the best car in the world. Just go get a job." So I said, "Okay, get me a 911-S." He got me a 912, used. I mean, I might as well be driving some goddamn Mustang or Volkswagen. - Of course. - Mm, what did you do about it? - I told him, you know? I said, "Look, I need a car that's gonna get me to this job, faster and safer." Do you know what he said? He said that a 912 was just as good as a 911-S. He doesn't even know anything. - Can you talk to him right now? What do you wanna say to him? - What do you mean, talk to him as if he were here? - Mm-hmm. - Daddy, I appreciate you getting me a car. If you're gonna get me one, get me one I won't be embarrassed to drive. - Dale, how about you? - The same goddamn thing every single night, my mother. I walk in the house, I get to the door, and I can just feel her, sitting behind the door, getting angry at me. I just wanna go someplace else, you know? I just feel her sitting there, getting into a pose. - Is this something that happened to you recently? - Yes, this is something that happened to me recently. This is something that happens to me every single night when I go home. I walk in the door and I sit down, and I get a look. I get a couple one liners, a couple digs, good ones. - Mm-hmm, and what do you say in return? - I don't say anything. - All right, if you weren't worried about any retaliation and she was here right now, what would you like to say to her? - The same thing I've been saying to her. We've been living like this for two years. But it's an eternal pattern with my mother. I mean, she never gets tired of it. - Mm, all right, you never get tired of it. See if you can put it in the present tense and talk to her right now. - Should I talk to the wall? - Just pretend she's here. - I, I can't talk to the wall. Can I talk to you? - Sure. - Okay Mom, Mom? Mom, we've been living like this for two years now, and you've insisted on giving up your friends, and you've insisted on moving outta the neighborhood. And you make assholes out of us. Every single time we go to the supermarket, we go in separate entrances and meet back at the car like espionage agents. And you tell them all stupid, ridiculous lies. And she's found strangers who she's trying to confide in as friends, instead of confiding in the people who are her friends. She's made so much trouble for me, and you know, and I go home at night and I see her with the baby, and I know that she loves him. I mean, the whole thing is for my benefit. - What's the name of your baby? - Look, that doesn't even matter, when her baby just happens to be Black. - And my mother happens to be a bigot. - (chuckling) I'm sorry. I mean, I thought from the way you spoke that it was deformed or something. - Yeah well, it is to her. - Oh, no you see, the reason why I asked is because I'm pregnant, I'm just two months. That gets my parents really uptight. 'Cause you know, I'm now never gonna get married. But I have an old man, we've been together for a long time, we just, you know, we're not into getting married. - Are you finished, is that all? - Yeah. - I was flying in from Detroit and, and I had my wife meet me at the airport, you know? And I waited for everybody to get off the plane, even the pilots, to just set the mood. Cause I wanted to tell her that, (stomping) that the group broke up, you know? Nobody to play with, nothing, nothing. Didn't even phase her, all she said was, "Let's get the car, go home." We go home, she's by the phone, and she's not on it more than three hours. She's got herself a job, a cocktail waitress job, and that bitch is out the door. Man, she accepted that thing so quick that my group broke up. You know, like I could, I couldn't believe it. - What was it then that made you angry? - Well I was, well I, I wanted sympathy. - All right, what did you do about it? - I sat there. She left, and the phone rang. Got some people asking me to do a gig for a jazz group, not a big thing. Just a two-night, two-night thing at a club. It was pretty good, you know? I got loose, we ripped it up. Got it off, you know? - You never told her how you felt. - Well, you don't know how I play drums. - So, what did you say to her, Glen? - She was there, man. Ain't no way in this world she couldn't get the picture of what I was feeling. - If she was here right now, what would you say to her? - I just don't understand the reason that she just wouldn't- - Talk to her. - Tell me anything. - Talk to her right now. - She just, all right, you got a phone? I'll talk to her. - Just talk to her right now. - For you man, for me? - For either of us. - Baby, why'd it take you so long, to tell me how you felt, being about me being so close to this group, you know? It's been years, and I feel like I've been living on borrowed time from you, you know? I feel like everything I've done, made or believed in has been a waste of time. I can't live like that. - At the beginning of the semester, I asked my students to call me Jennifer and I loved it. But our principal has been putting a lot of pressure on me, 'cause he thinks I'm too progressive. And when he hears the students calling me Jennifer down the halls, he gets furious. And now he wants me to go back and have my students call me Ms. Palmer, which is really difficult. Since they've been calling me Jennifer it's like, created a whole new mood, like really intimate and informal. - What is it that made you angry, Jennifer? - That he's making me change. - Bud, are you with us? - Yeah, you see, I was watching this special, that aired on TV, you know? It's about the Olympics, you know? Mexico City, in '68. It was a trip, you know? They were interviewing some of the cats, you know? Some of the cats who had won some of the races, and some of the guys who had, you know, protested. (exhaling) This one cat man, one of the guys who had did this black glove thing, you know? He was rapping. I'm telling you man, he was putting it to them. He was telling them like it is, man. And he was a trip, because he was saying all these things about sports that you know, that I've always felt. You know, and I've never said, you know? I mean like, you know, it just opened me up, you know? And my old man is sitting there making these comments and, I mean like, "Look at those cats, and what he really said was, "Look at those niggers." Said, "They're messing it up for all of us Blacks, you know?" I'm wondering, now why can't a cat say what he feels, you know? He's saying, "Think of the image they're setting for kids." Now why in the world should you have to worry about an image if you can't be truthful? I mean, this cat was telling the truth, man. Some of the things that happened in track and field, where they'd shoot cats up and give them drugs, man. Somebody should be able to say that. - How about you, Bud? Have you ever told him how you feel? - (laughing) I'm gonna tell big Ray Johnson that his son agrees with some relatives? Doctor, you ain't crazy, are you? - Well, why don't you try and tell him right now? - All right. I wanna ask her a question. What's your thing? - My thing? - I mean, you show up here and you're telling us about these 911s and these 912s. I mean, is that what you're coming here for? - I'm sorry, I guess I should have explained better when I was telling her. I got busted for drugs, and you know my father, instead of sending me off to some jail to learn basket weaving, they fixed it so I could come here. - Rich girl's arrest. - Yeah, how'd you guess? So I'm doing it to keep them cool, to cool them down. 'Cause I really wanna have this kid, and I know it's gonna work out. I mean you know, a lot of my friends are getting high and everything, but I'm not. This kid gets me higher than any drug could ever do. (laughing) Like my old man, he's gonna go downtown. He's gonna take these natural childbirth thing, what's that, you know? Those breathing things, you know? - He's gonna breathe on it. - (laughing) And when the time comes for us to have the baby, we'll get, get in the camper and go out to the woods someplace. Deliver it ourselves, we don't have to register. - Pete. - Won't have to get drafted, don't have to get- - Pete, could you ask Sally psychedelic to lower her volume? - You tell her, Bill. - Honey, could you cool the verbiage? I mean, could you- - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to- - She touched me, man. I don't know where she gets her goddamn nerve from, to touch me. I don't even know the lady. - I'm sorry, okay? - Look, women aren't my thing. So just keep your hands to yourself, will you? - Billy, you dig this? What's the matter, man? This ain't like you. - That's right, this isn't like me. I'm the timid one, I'm the, I'm the Aunt Tommy in the group, and I don't wanna be that way anymore, it's old. - Oh, old. - What's bugging you, Bill? - The, I can't- - You can't what? - I couldn't, I, like I, I, I couldn't be myself, and ah, I know it's written all over me, and I'm tired of pretending it isn't, and I can't deal with it being what it is, that's all. I can't deal with it. = [Peter] You can't deal with what being what it is? (soft gentle uneasy music) Hi, this is Dr. Carlson, please hold my calls. - Listen, are you getting tired of us, Peter? - No, but I'm not gonna live forever, and I'd kinda like explore all the possibilities. - Wanna get high with me? - Well depends, what would be in it for me? - Hmm, whatever you put into it. - What happens after we get high? - We turn on Glen's new album, get high off of that. - And sit there staring at each other, saying, "Far out, heavy, I can dig it." - Have you been smoking some grass or something? You know weed, you know, sniff a little coke? - Come on Bud, you know I don't have to. I've got an announcement. You're cured, and- (group laughing) - Yeah. - Bill's gonna be with us tonight. - He's returning to the group? - Mm-hmm. - How does he feel about coming back? - Well, I don't think I oughta talk to Bill. - Is there something special we should do or say? - No just, just be natural. Just, just relax. - Mm-mm. - Yep. - Hi. - Hey. - Hey Bill. - Hi Bill. - Hi Bill. - Hi Bill. - How you doing? - Come on in, Buddy? - Looking good, man. - This is yours. - Oh. Oh my God, you've really grown. - Come on, sit here. - Progress. - Yeah, it's really happening. - Yeah. - I wanna try something with you, close your eyes. Everybody's got, Dale, how about you? Okay, I'd like you to go way back to, oh a time, or any particular incident, when you really felt that somebody cared for you. And there's something very beautiful going on right now. Now that beautiful thing is making you feel very, very warm. It's making you feel very, very close, and very, very loved. Chris, can I start with you? - Hm, ah, I'm trying to remember. - Would you like me to come back to you? - yeah. - Glen, who do you see standing there? What's happening? - Ah let's see. Well I was in high school, and my father had fallen off the ladder, you know, and hurt his back. He's been in traction for like six months, and my mother and I were taking, been taking care of the store, grocery store. But anytime I had any free time, I went out to this little field, you know, just across from the house. I could see where my sister was. And I'd take the nine iron out and chip shots and whack, I'd just get lost, you know? This one afternoon though, my father got up and went out in the front porch. And well, he had his rubber sandals on, and his dirty chinos rolled up, a safety pin holding them together with his Hawaiian shirt and his belly hanging out, and a can of beer and his Yankee baseball cap on. And all his war medals on his Yankee baseball cap, and his head shaved this day, (chuckling) and very fresh. And he breaks into his full sprint down the street after this cat. Finally I, I finally found out that the guy was a thief and stealing, like robbing jewelry, like you know, from the tract homes. Tackles the guy, slings him over his shoulder and comes down the street, singing, you know. ♪ Aye, be rising of the moon You know, and all these Irish songs, and the dogs are howling. (laughing) It's, it's really bizarre. But it broke up the Saturday, right? In suburbia. Anyway, he throws the guy down on the lawn, and calling to the people, you know, "Who's gonna call the police?" Nobody did, they all go into the houses. Finally I went in and called the police, and he yells in, "Get me a beer, I'm losing energy." And I bring out the beer, cops come, and they say, "Well you know, we can't arrest the guy, 'cause you don't have any," you know, "any evidence." And my father is really mad. He steals the guy's flashlight. He was almost ready to get the badge, and they left, and he lost face in the whole community, you know? 'Cause he had done a great thing. And he just, I don't know, he couldn't, he couldn't take it anymore, and he just sort of split, and I found him in Mexico trying to get an army together. And he, (chuckling) they caught him and put him in the VA hospital. Couldn't take the quiet life, great man. (laughing) - I wanna tell you where I got lost, Glen, which is, how are you involved with him? - Presence, I was in involved with the presence of the man. He was great. - That made you feel close to him? - Of course it did. As close as you could be to your father. - I see. How do you wanna do it, eyes open or eyes closed? - It really doesn't make no difference. - Try it with your eyes closed. - I think I'm keeping them, keeping them open. - Okay, who do you see standing there? - My father. - And what did your father look like? - Everybody say we, we look just alike. (laughing) He was my hero. I was 12 at the time, you know? And we had been working out together all summer, you know. 'Cause he was still playing ball, and I was getting ready for my first Pop Warner League season. - Could you talk just a little bit louder. - Yeah, I was, you know, getting ready for my first Pop Warner League season. And I remember I was telling all the guys, "My father be at the game," you know? And they, they were all glad to hear it, because you know, he's a professional ball player. They said their parents would be there too. And I didn't know it at the time, but he would be playing the 49ers, and he'd have to go up to San Francisco on Friday, so he wouldn't be able to be there, you know? And I remember the day of the game, like all the guys are looking at me like, you know, "You lied," you know, "where's your old man?" I was feeling terrible, boy. I was ah, I was running the kickoffs back for our team, you know? I was down there waiting for it. And I mean, I just wanted to call, crawl in a hole and die, you know? And I was standing down there and I looked up, and coming across the field was my old man. (laughing) - Oh, that's great. - You know, I don't know what he did. He must have pulled some strings in San Francisco or something, but he came down, you know? He got them to fly down the day before he had to play just to watch me for three hours, you know? And I thought that was terrific, you know? I ran the kickoff all the way back. (laughing) - Dale, who do you see standing there? - Oh, I see me and my Daddy. - Mm-hmm. - And it was a warm Saturday morning. It was real nice, the air smelled nice, you know? And me and him were walking down the street, and it was my first March, you know, for Washington? I didn't even understand half of what he's telling me, all about the March and everything. But he's, talking and I feel like a regular colleague, you know? (Glen laughing) And then we get on the bus, and the bus is filled mostly with Black people, and they were so nice. And they're all talking and everything, and then everyone's telling stories. And then we got to Washington and we had this great big settlement house, that they had rented, you know? And everybody had their own patrols, and everybody had different things to do. And we were making signs, and some people were on food patrols, and then we'd get out there and we'd march around Washington, and we all had our signs, you know? And this went on for like four days, you know? Oh, we were terrific. - How'd you feel about your father at that time? - Oh, I loved him. He organized the whole deal. - Bill, what's happening in your head right now? - Well, this is when we lived in New York and it was warm. It was hot, it was a warm afternoon, early June. I'm about 11 years old, I'd just come home from school. And the phone rings and it's my uncle. And he said that my aunt was killed in a plane crash. (Glen laughing) - Tell me darling, this is your favorite Auntie? - What's so funny? - That's a warm moment? (laughing) - Well, I'm getting to my warm moment. - Yeah. - Do tell. - So yeah, she was my father's sister, and I realized I'd have to be the one to tell my father. And he was coming home from work early that day, it was a Tuesday, and every Tuesday my father would, he'd come home from work early. He'd have a couple of drinks and go off to the neighborhood movie houses. He'd go to all three of them, just go from one to the other. And so he comes home and I tell him, and he does get a little crazy and starts drinking. (chuckling) See, whenever anybody would die, my father would get very, very drunk and he'd go around saying, "I'm next." (group members laughing) So this time he got on the phone and he was, you know, making funeral arrangements. And all this time he's on the phone, he's asking me to do things for him. Like he'd say, "Fill my drink, make me spaghetti, do this, do that," and I do it. And meanwhile, he's getting very, very, very drunk. Anyway, finally he finishes, and by this time he's really loaded. And he asked me to go to the movies with him. Well I go, and I'm sitting there. I reach out my hand and he held it, the whole movie. Well, (laughing) see he, he would always go to the movies, but he went by himself, he never took me anywhere. And he had asked me to do all these things for him, and he didn't beat me, and he didn't scream at me, and he didn't put me down. It was the first time I ever felt like a human being in my own house. - Were you able to tell him? - Are you kidding? You'd have to be very careful what you say to my father. - How long did it last? - About two days. (group members chuckling) Then he was back to his old self again. He'd cuff us on the ear, run upstairs, turn on the hi-fi and listen to "Pagliacci" and cry. (group laughing) So that's my father. - How about your mother? - Well, when he hates me, she hates me. But since the last marathon, when I, I did my little number here, my, her whole attitude toward me has changed, you know? She's, she said she feels responsible and would like to understand. Can you turn that thing off? It really bugs me. - You never objected to it before. - Well, of course I never objected to before. It was a group decision, and I'm a member of the group I thought I had to go along. - Oh come on man, you're an individual. You know you had a chance to say something. - Well, it freaks me to have all this technology around me. It bothers me, it really does. - Bill, you know that nobody outside of this group ever sees these tapes. Well, I think what's really freaking you out though, is that I have this, some permanent record of something that's really painful to you. - What are you planning to do with it? - Well you know, things sometimes happen pretty fast in here and I miss things. - You miss things, all right. Why don't you, why don't you just tune into what's happening? Why depend on all this equipment? - All right, I hope that what happened with you last time, for instance, will never happen again. - I hope so too man, I really hope so. - After that last session, I must have played this tape at least four or five times. - What'd you learn? - Mainly I was trying to figure out what it was about me that had taken me so far off the track that I wasn't able to tune in on what was going on with you earlier. - Get any clues, huh? - I think what screwed me up was, I was so caught up in playing the doctor role that I wasn't able to feel your pain in my gut. - Maybe if you looked at it, it would be helpful, Bill. - No I don't, I have no interest in looking at it. - Come on man, give it a chance. I mean it's like, it's like our instant replay. You see films, you know, you don't look at the good plays. You look at the bad plays so you can work on them. It's the same principle. - Come on, if I can look at it, you can look at it. - It might not be as bad as you remember it. - Yeah, why don't you give it a try? - You are the star. - Look, he wants to see it anyway, look at him. (laughing) - I'll hold your hand. - All right, I'll peek at it. But if I don't like it, I'm gonna close my eyes. - I'll hold your hand. - Now this has gotta be good. - Oh yeah. - Look ah, women aren't my thing. So, so just keep your hands to yourself, will you? - Billy, you dig this? What's the matter, man? This ain't like you. - Not like me, yeah I'm the timid one, I'm the, I'm the Aunt Tommy of the group, and I don't wanna be that way anymore, that's all. - what's bugging you, Bill? - I, I can't- - You can't what? - I, I couldn't, I, I can't. See, I couldn't be myself. I know it's written all over me and like I'm, I'm tired of pretending it isn't, and I can't deal with it being what it is. So what's the- - You can't deal with what being what it is? - Oh man, you can't help me. You don't know shit, man. - Maybe I could help you if you looked at me while you were talking to me. - Okay, I'm looking at you, happy? You happy now? You're just like Frank, man. - Who's Frank? - You are just like Frank. My older brother Frank, you know, I've talked about him. Don't you listen? Frank, who lives in the Valley, Frank. - Oh. - I was at his house last Sunday. Didn't wanna go, but his wife, you know, his wife, she's the cunt of the world and like, I couldn't get out of it, you know what I mean? And he started, you know, the usual. He started putting me down. And like, he was always calling me a sissy when we were young, you know? - Wow, take your time, Bill. - Yeah, I, well I just, I just sat there and took it, you know? Like I didn't show anything, but inside I was like, raging against him. Like I wanted to, like I wanted to look him in the eye. Like I wanted to say to him, you know? Ha, you think, you think, you're not fooling me, man. I know, I know you. I know you better than anybody else. You settled into such fakeness, and you think you got it so great. Well, you're a fakey. - Bill, why are you sweating? - Okay, I'm fucked up. Man, I'm a little fucked up, but I'm trying. Like, like I wasn't afraid to experience anything. But don't put me down, man. (chuckling) Put me down. - Bill. - Don't put me down. - Bill, you all right, man? - Peter, he's dozing, man. - Can you hear me, Bill? - Yeah. - Can you stand up, Bill? - Sure I can, I don't wanna, I don't wanna. - I'd like you to stand up. (hand slapping) - Hey, take it easy with him. - Get the fuck outta my way, call an ambulance. - You outta lay down. Hey, get that chick outta the bathroom. - Please don't touch me. - Please don't throw up on me, come on. - Please let me die, please let me die! They were slapping my face in the ambulance, you know, to keep me awake. And I looked up and there was this cop, and he said to me, "Too bad kid, you didn't take enough." - Oh wow. - Encouraging. - At the time I felt it was too bad, but I gave him the finger, I lived. - Hey, that's doing it. - You still agree with him, Bill? - Yeah sometimes, like just seeing that. I realize that I can get into that same, I can get to that same place very easily. It's a very deep feeling inside of me. - Is it any clearer to you now? why you did it? - Yeah, I think so. - Bill, do you think it was like one thing, or like an accumulation of a lot of things? - (sighing) I guess it was a lot of things like, like at that time I was going downhill very fast, you know? I remember I was in the bathroom taking the pills, and when I came out there was this exercise going on. I don't know I, I guess I wanted you to pick up on my feelings, you know? I wanted you to read where I was at. I expected you were going to, and I wanted you like, to call my parents to explain me to them. I mean, it's crazy. I don't wanna talk anymore, okay? - I wonder maybe, the rest of the group, if we could use this as an opportunity to focus on our own feelings, maybe the kinds of things in your own life right now that might make you wanna respond the way that, that Bill did. - You mean about committing suicide? - Mm-hmm. - I thought about it a lot, but he did it, you know? - Mm-hmm, while we were watching the videotape, I was noticing tears in your eyes, Dale. - Not mine. - Well, I sense a kind of a sadness in you. What's that about? - About dying. - Did you ever wanna die? - Yeah, every single night when I go home, except for my baby. I have my mother and I have a great job at the bakery, and I have to walk between the bakery and my mother's, and the scenery is really great, really great, but it gets so boring. (exhaling) - You mean everything around you is that miserable? - Mm-hmm, especially trying to raise a Black baby in this fantastic society. - Why do you always have to say Black baby, huh? Seriously, I mean when you pick him up, do you say, "Come to Mommy, Black baby," when you feed him, do you say, "Here's your bottle, Black baby"? - Would you ask Othello why it has to bother him so much if I'm trying to help? - Why don't you help me? - Because you don't need my help. 'Cause you already have your Guccis, and you already have your sports cars, and you got a big, strong Black body that lets you stick your nose into the white man's world. Try pushing your mind just the teeny bit, and see what happens. It's the white guys who are the heads of everything, the store owners, the Santa Clauses, the President, your coaches. It's the black guys who are still doing all the delivering, and I don't want my son to be one of them. - So what are you doing about it? - Well, I can't lead a crusade by myself, but I'm trying. I'm working in breakfast programs, I'm working in daycare centers, I go around to the playgrounds. I'm working in welfare centers. I go to the organizations and I'm stuffing envelopes. I'm picketing. - What's your reaction Bud, to what she's been saying? - I think she's full of shit. - You tell her? - Dale, I think you're full of shit. You're always talking about what you're doing for the Black people. Now, how in the hell are you gonna do something for us? Look at you, why don't you do something for yourself? And when I was a kid, you know, in the play, I used to go to the playground. We had this director, white guy, you know, Mr. Hanson. Big man, you know? All the Blacks run up to Mr. Hanson, you know? Big, strong cat, heavy, you know? We had a big banquet at the end of the year with the mayor and everybody, you know, big shots out there. You know, he couldn't even talk to him, he was nothing. Know what I mean? He couldn't talk to his people. He couldn't even communicate. He was a big man with us. That's why he was always in the ghetto, 'cause we, we made him a big man, but you get him with his own people, he couldn't do nothing. - That's a fantastic story, Bud. (clapping) It's supposed to be analogous with me? - Why do you think because somebody's Black, he's gotta have a problem? And why simply because I'm an athlete, you always stereotype me? - Jennifer? - Oh, saved by Jennifer. - Yeah. - You've been very quiet. - I've been listening. - Are you comfortable with this? What's, what's been going on in your head while they've been talking? Where are you, what kind of image are you seeing? Are you seeing? - It's a place I went to last weekend. Um, it's a retreat up in the mountains. It's like a group of people, and they're trying to relate better, and they don't wear clothes. - A nudie place? - Yes. - Did you party with them? - Mm-hmm. - What'd you do that for? - To try to feel what they're feeling. - You mean, you got naked with them? - Of course, you don't go to a place like that and wear clothes. - Did you get into it? I mean, did you find what you were looking for? - Not really. - That really impresses me. I would never have, have imagined you could get into that. - See Bill, that's just what I'm talking about. Because she's a teacher, she can't do it. You know, images. Why you always gotta stereotype people? People do it to me, you know? They're always try to make you something that you're not. And you know, if they keep doing it, you're gonna be just that. Just an image, something for them to jack off to. - Man, I listen to you, and it seems very double standard to me. I mean, like I see you on TV. You're an all-around wonderful guy. You tell kids that smoking dope's a no-no. And you're doing great things, you know? I, what is it that you really wanna say? I, I don't understand. - Man, I've smoked dope, you know? - Okay. - I mean you know, what if you get a little kid in the ghetto, man, how's he gonna get out? You know, he gets strung out on drugs, he never get out, man. - Oh, I got that, I get that, I really do. - I dig what I say. It's just that, you know, you get cats man, people, they just expect you to say it, you know? - Is this something that you're experiencing with everybody? - Yeah, just about. - Anybody particularly? - A coach, boy he's a prick. And once I, I hurt my knee. All week man, you know the man didn't say one thing to me? Not, "How's your knee, Bud?" You know, "How're you feeling?" Not one fucking thing, you know? And right before the next game, he comes up to me. He says, "Bud, we need you, you know? You gotta take a shot, you know, gotta get," I mean shit, you know? I wasn't nothing to the cat. I don't even know I'm saying this. - What do you mean? - It's my old man. - Well, what about your old man? What, what do you wanna say to him? Can you talk to him? - Why do you always make me this fucking image? I mean, before the games man, I gotta get the shakes, sometime I get sick. I haven't even slept in months, man. - I think there's something about it you enjoy. - I enjoy playing, I just don't want the shit that goes with it. - Don't you get any release out of beating the hell out of somebody on a football field? - It's part of the game, man. - (chuckling) Okay. What, what do you say inside yourself when you're on the football field, you're taking a guy down? - Arms and legs saying, you know, "Get him," you know? I'd like to tell them to fuck it. Fuck their money and their publicity, all that shit. I don't wanna be their image. - Why don't you say it? - I just did. - Yeah, you said it in here. But what about outside, where it really counts? What, what's your reaction to Bud, what he's been saying? - You don't understand man, what the cat's up against. Everybody's paying for him to say a certain thing a certain way, even fans. If he goes on TV and starts to talk about something that he really wants to say for his people or for himself, I mean all of a sudden, the big bucks cut your water off. - Right on, man. - Just like that, is that what happened to your group? Is that why it broke up? - Well, two of the guys went out on their own, you know? Wanted to do something different. They did all right, you know? But you know what it is to be with somebody, you know, like for years, five years. And then all of a sudden this, we found out the guy, cat we knew, playing with was . - Oh, this is getting interesting. - Nice. (chuckling) Well it just, it's not that we had anything against him really, it just, we didn't know how to treat him, we didn't know how to act. We didn't know what to do. I mean, it just, and it got very tedious, you know? You know, I'm trying to keep the music together, you know, keep everybody happy and shit. It just got cold, we couldn't hold together. - You with another group now? - Yeah but it, it's not the same. - Would you like the group to get together again? I mean, is there any chance of that? - It's just dissolved, I mean, I mean, we're living within blocks of each other and I never see them, it's over. - How do you feel about it? - It was more than music, you know? It was, it was, I don't know, there was a pulse there. I mean, it's just something I can't get, I play with other people. It's just not, it's just not there, you know? But it's, that's too depressing, really. 'Cause it's over, I know it is, you know, that's cool. I was watching those tapes, you know? - The May tapes? - Yeah, the May tapes. Man, I'm coming on saying like everything, you know, is a problem. I got like no money, hassles with my old lady, you know? That's BS. I got bread, I got this song, it's making it. My old lady and I are, you know, we're drinking. We're getting high. But when I don't play music, I just don't know what to do it myself, you know? I, I have nothing, nothing to put it to, you know? - I dig what you're going through. Eddie's got the same changes. - Eddie, is he a musician, do I know him? - Oh yeah, he's a musician, but he's not famous at all. - How old is he? - He's 18. - He hasn't done anything yet? - Well, well he's trying to get a group together. Just doesn't know right now if he's coming or going. - Hmm, seems to be the trend. - Yeah. - Incidentally, how are things going between you and Eddie? - Not too good. - Yeah I thought so, and that's why I told you to bring him with you, why didn't you? - He didn't wanna come. - Did you ask him? - Yeah, I asked him. - How did you ask him? - I told him, you know, about the doctor wanting him to- - No I mean, how did you ask him? What did you say to him? - Oh, I said mm, I said, "Pete, the doc, you know the doctor, he wants you to come down to the meetings this weekend." - Okay, hold up. I'd like to try something with you Chris, okay? Here's Eddie, talk to him right now. Ask him to come to the group tonight, go ahead Chris. Go ahead. - Um Eddie, the doctor wants you to come to the meetings because he's getting a very one-sided picture of our relationship, which is true. And I'd like you to come. - Look I'd like to, but I don't feel like leaving the house tonight. So maybe some other time. - What's? - He doesn't talk like that. - All right, you show him how Eddie talks. You be Eddie, okay? - Can I be Christine? - All right. And you show him how he talks, you start. - Honey I, I really, I really dig being pregnant now. I'm into my body and it's changes, and it's beautiful. - Christine, I'm tired of hearing you. - I know you're tired, just listen. It's getting a little scary, you know? I'm in my sixth month and Pete, the doctor, thought it'd be a great idea if you came to the marathon this weekend, to like help me, you know? - Don't talk to me about that marathon stuff, because they are a bunch of sick people there. And don't associate me with them, because I am not sick and I'm not going. - Well, I got the picture. (chuckling) - Okay, well let's switch it around one more time, and let's take it right from the top, Chris. Here's Eddie again, talk to him. - Eddie, I've been going for four or five months now. You can go for a few minutes. - Don't bore me. I, I'm not going down to Beverly Hills to listen to some ah, prick, telling me how to live my life with his values. - Well, if not for me, for the baby? - All right, come on. - It's your kid too. - I already know the whole story. He's gonna want us to get married. - No, he just, he just wants to meet. He wants to get a better perspective of our problem, in quotes. - Don't you understand that I don't want you? I don't want anything to do with you. I don't want anything to do with you at all. - Hey stop it, stop it! - Don't you understand? - Come on, you can't change your mind like that now. - But I have, lover. - You can't. - I don't want it. - Look, you had plenty of time before. It's a little too late now. You spent the money that Daddy gave me for the abortion. - You helped me spend it. - That's because you gave me this big line on how we were gonna keep the baby. - I don't want it, I don't want the baby. - Oh, so now it's all my thing, huh? - That's right, that's right. - So it's my kid. You're such a fucking liar. I mean, you write all this stuff about how you love life and you love children and everything else, and that means that everything, All that, was that, it was just a lot of lies, right? It's all bullshit, right, huh? You got all these ideas and how you're gonna go out and get your own group together. You know, you're gonna go out and make it. What about these songs that you're gonna be singing when you're there, like having a baby is like living with a Zen master, what about that? I mean, how can you live with yourself knowing that you've, you fucked me up, huh? How can you live with yourself? You know how long I've spent beating up my body for this kid? And you, this kid's gonna be deformed because you've got me shooting up again! - Christine, the baby is only gonna be deformed If you make it that way. How can you do this to the kid? How can you do it? - It's easy, it's needles, and it's- - Stop it, you know what I'm talking about. The baby's living in your stomach, how can you do that to him? - Well Chris, whatever happened to all your, you know, natural childbirth talk, you know? You're gonna put the baby on your warm belly the minute it crawls into the cold, cruel world. What happened to that bullshit, Chris? - Do you have a habit? - She's got a habit. That's what happened to all that beautiful stuff. It was just too much pressure. - Is that it, Chris? Are you doing it to have a good time? - No, just any time, anymore. Okay. - Three weeks ago today, I having a birthday party. - You're a Scorpio? - Yeah. - Far out. - I was having a good time. - I'm right on the cusp of Scorpio, Sag. - What's yours, what date? - 23rd, this month. - Well, this is the 23rd of this month. - It's your birthday today? - Yeah. - Far out, it's my boss' birthday today too. - How old are you? - I'm 18. - Yeah? - I can go to New York City and drink legally. (chuckling) I seem so old now. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. - What a way to spend your birthday? - No kidding. - I just thought it'd be interesting. - What'd you get? - I don't know yet. - My mother spit at me for my 18th birthday. - Your mother's a trip. - Where'd she hit you? - She just missed us. I was walking with Robert down the street. She saw us holding hands out of the window and made a face, and then she spit. - Is that true? - Mm-hmm. - Too much. - I wouldn't make it up. - So what'd you do, Bud? - I just graduated from high school, and I had millions of colleges wanting me, and I sat down and I had to decide between three colleges. I had all my relatives over, and I decided to go to Southern Cal, and we had a big party. - It's a happy birthday. - I- - I remember my 18th birthday. I, if anyone's interested. I was working for my parents after school, and I don't remember what, what got my father started, but I made some minuscule error in some figures I was adding up and, and he just beat the shit outta me. I mean, he really just gave it to me. I was, I got, had a black eye. (chuckling) And my mother, my mother was screaming at me on one side and he was pummeling me on the other. And I, all day long at work I kept thinking they're gonna, they're really gonna make me a party. So that was the party they gave me. I got very pissed off and I, I, I think I had just come out like maybe a couple months before. So after work I put on some, I remember putting on these dark glasses, huge dark glasses. I looked like a hornet with a thyroid condition. I had these huge black glasses, and I start on the Boulevard and I picked up two guys. (Christine laughing) So my birthday was happy and sad. - Despite the eye thing. - Your father seems really like the worst. - Oh, he is. - 18's a magic year, you know? - Oh yeah. - 'Cause your parents are trying to get you outta the house. My old man was trying for about four months to get rid of me, right? I guess it bothered him when I walked outta the shower every day, right? But um, he brought a tether ball on a pole for my birthday, and we went out and we did battle, and he broke my nose. The ball hit me right in the face. (laughing) - I hope you left the house after that. - I did, I got the point. (laughing) - Sugar, you sure is looking pretty spiffy tonight. - I don't know whether to salute or say hello, man. - You know what you look like, Bud? You look like a recruitment poster for the lots. - You should just hang with it. This is what all us well-dressed athletes are wearing today. - Yeah, if I walk down the street dressed like that, they'd clap my ass in jail. - How come you're being so happy man, after losing all my bread in that playoff? - Your bread? Oh, I guess I could use a Super Bowl check. We shoulda won that game, man. - Really, I was praying. - Incidentally Bud, what was your father's reaction to that? - It was funny. (chuckling) You know, normally when we play a game, win our lose, I come home, he's always giving me this static. You know, what we did, what we shoulda done or something. He hates to hear me complain. He says, "An athlete is supposed to lose with dignity," whatever in the hell that is. So I come home, ready for him. Walk in, "We'd have won that got goddamn game, it wasn't for the coach," he didn't say nothing. - What's happened to him? - I don't know, but can you imagine me filling myself up, rehearsing all the way home, and he doesn't even say anything, he let it go. (laughing) - Ah, but maybe he sensed you were ready for him. - Honey, he took one look at those clothes of his, and went into shock. - (laughing) Look, I'm telling you, last week now, I'm sitting in my room, I'm reading this magazine. They got these four militants on the cover. - Mm, I saw that, it was four um, four football players exposing the sports establishment. Jock lib, oh I saw it. - I'm in my room reading it, you know? And my father's in the other room watching TV. The President is on, talking some crap, you know? And he's telling me to come in and watch it. You know, "Bud come in, Bud come in," you know? So I'm reading my magazine. He walks in my room and grabs, snatches the magazine outta my hand. I stood up and snatched it back. And I said, "Look, I'm not interested in no TV show. I'm reading this magazine. When I finished reading it, if it's on, I'll go in and watch it then." Well, he went into shock. I'm telling you, he went into shock and went outta the room. Now I'm sitting there now, and I know I gotta go in the room and face the music sooner or later. So I finish reading, I go in the living room, the TV's off. He's sitting there, he gives me no static. He just asked me if, if I finished reading the magazine, he'd like to read it. - How do you think it happened, this change? - I don't know, but see, what I'm saying is, not his change. I stood up, I grabbed the magazine. I said, "Look, I'm reading this magazine." It was me you know, and I've never done that. - Well, I have a feeling he might be pacifying you, Bud. I mean, you've really been standing up to him. Maybe he feels he's losing control of you, so he's adjusting to your changes. - Yeah well maybe, but I still stood up to him, didn't I? Oh I wonder where all the girls stay? I'll probably go out to the beach and look for me an apartment soon. - I'm almost getting high hearing about this. - Yeah. - Well, whenever anybody makes a little progress here, I feel personally encouraged. - Does your father know you're coming here, Bud? - My old man? - Yeah. - Group? Oh, no that'd freak him out. - Why would that freak him out, Bud? - I don't know, he just wouldn't expect that of, you know, his son, you know. It's funny, 'cause I come home in the morning and he thinks I've been out with some broad, you know? His philosophy is, you gotta get all you can. So he thinks I'm out getting it all, Jack. (laughing) - Hit it while it's hot. - Yes. - Hit it while it's hot. - Mm-hmm. - Hey what Bill, I'm talking about broads now, and that's two completely different subjects. - First, I don't know how different it is. And second, and that's what I'm talking about too. See, I finally made it with a chick. (laughing) - Billy! - Are you aware of the way you told that to the group? - No. - Well, you were really saying something that was very important, but the way in which you said it kinda made me feel like you were belittling it, like you were putting yourself down. - No, no it was like a surprise. It was a miracle. I, I just wanted you all to remember where it came from. You know what I mean? - Bill, did you do it 'cause you liked her, or did you wanna prove something? - I did it cause I really liked her. - Really? - How'd you dig it? - Well, at first I think I was scared and, then I got it, I really dug it, you know? I really enjoyed it, I liked it. - And how did she like it? - Well, I think she, she had a good time, I think. I mean, you know, you're never really sure, are you? - All I know, if she dug it, she sure has a funny way of showing it. - What makes, what makes, what makes you think you know who it is? - I'll give you three to one I know who it is. Look I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done that. - If it makes you feel better Bill, why don't you talk about it? - I just wanted to say that it was a very full, that it was a very rich and very wonderful experience. - What do you mean, it was wonderful experience? - Well, like I never really have made it with anybody I dug before, and it was nice to do it that way, you know? - Well, if you liked it so much. - What do you wanna say, Dale? - I'm not gonna say anything to you. - Yeah, if I dug it so much, what? - Then why couldn't you ah, handle it? I don't know. - Well, like it, it's very new to me, you know? It's, I'm not, it was a very new thing and, I, I gave as much as I could, you know I, like, we're very different people with very different sets of needs, I... - Bill, at least you can talk about it. - Not very well. - Yeah, but you're open enough to- - Look I wish, I, I hope that ah, I wish that it could, I could give more. I wish, I wish I could, but I'm not there yet. I'm trying, but I'm, maybe when I get better, we can start it over and you know? - Gee, I wish I could wait for you to get better, but I'm a little too busy right now. - Yeah, she's very busy. She, she moved out of her mother's place into her own apartment. - Hey, that's good, hey. (laughing) - Is your baby living with you, Dale? - No. - What, your baby's not with you? - No, he's with my mother. - I thought you um, said the whole point of you getting a, an apartment as so you and your can be together. - Yeah, well ah, it didn't work out. See, I have some, some great neighbors and um, and they were taking care of Robbie. My mother called me up and she said she wanted me and Robbie to come home. And I said ah, that I had been waiting for her to ask me to come home for two years and um, and I wasn't gonna come home, but that Robbie cried for her every single night. And ah, and he couldn't get along that well with the neighbors so, so that's where he is. He's with my mother. - So you pick him up after work? - No, I don't pick him up after work. I work very hard every day in the bakery. And when I get home at night, I've been able to go out now. I've made some friends, and I can go out now. That's a step forward for me. And as soon as I get some money, I'm gonna have some babysitters and I'm gonna get him back with me. - Yeah Robbie he, he doesn't feel comfortable, you know, with the strange new neighbors, but I'm sure he's gonna feel great with some new babysitter. You're full of shit. You've been giving us this shit for six months you've been coming here, telling us this crap about you need an apartment so you and your son could be together. You got an apartment, you got two groovy neighbors who are gonna keep your baby for you, free. And you're still not together. - I'm gonna gonna have Robbie with me. He's gonna be with me, I know that. - You will, he's gonna. Six months, I've been here in the same crap. He's gonna, excuses. - It's not excuses, I made a step. I made one step, I moved, and I know that he's gonna be with me. - Yeah, you're stepping for the parties, to the show, having a good time. - Yeah, once a week I go out to a party, that's right. Because I don't want he and I to grow older resenting each other, all right? - Look, she's not out every night dining and dancing. - Like some people are. - Be cool, I, I, do you ever grow with any straight cats? You know, not a guy who's never made it with a girl before, of some strung out brother in the ghetto who's looking up to the white princess, a straight cat. - Oh honey, I know. I know that I'm misunderstanding your point. You mean a guy has to be white to be nice? - I think what Bud may be saying, Dale, is do you ever go out with guys where you're not necessarily kind of in a superior position? - You mean that ah, the guy has to be inferior if he likes me? - Be on with you Dale, you know just what I mean. I mean a straight cat, not no cat in the ghetto looking up to the white queen or a fag. A straight guy, regular guy, can you handle that? - You bet I can handle that. - Then why in the hell haven't you? - Because I haven't met him yet. - Oh, I'm sure you've been out looking for him. - I think maybe what Bud's saying, what I've been kind of feeling Dale, is that there's such an, kind of an erratic and moody quality about you. That really only a guy with, who didn't value himself very much would stand for it very long. (Bud laughing) I don't think I would stand for it. - Oh Christ doctor, and I've been praying that you would ask me to the prom. (group members laughing) - That's right, I wouldn't stand for your little put downs and your one-liners, and I won't stand for you just using this group as a playground to dump a lot of your hostility on. - But Peter, don't we use everything? - What do you mean, Jennifer? - We all use everything. - I think you're losing me. Could you, you replace the word we with I, and just kinda talk about yourself? - I use everything. - What, for instance? - People, situations. We all use everything, to try and get something out of it for myself, something outta life. - So don't you get enough outta your teaching? - I was so locked into my teaching, that that was the only thing that existed. - You said was, and existed, you put it in the past tense. - I am a teacher. - Yeah, why aren't you locked up in it now? - I am. - Well you said was, which is it? - I am. - I am, I am. That's all you ever say, "I am a teacher." Now you just finished saying that you use things. Can you explain how you're using your teaching? - How do you use your children? - That's different, I don't use them. - Hey Jennifer, how are you using the group? - To try and solve my problems. - How would you feel about talking about some of those problems? - Well lately I've been having these problems, like these blackouts for like, three or four days, and I can't go out. - You've been having blackouts, and you've had more than one? - How long has this been going on? I mean, how often do you have them? - For a long time. - What, what, what does your school say about this? How can you do this? - Yeah, do you ever have them in the classroom? Like in the middle of class? - I mean, you've been coming here this whole time and you've never mentioned to us that you have blackouts? - Have you ever had one in an marathon meeting- - I lied to you, for like eight months I've been coming here, and I've been lying. - What about? - What have you been lying to us about? - I'm not teaching. - Were you fired? - What happened? - Why were you lying to us? - I lied. - You mean for eight months you've been coming here and giving us this shit? - You know that all you ever say to us is- - Just leave me alone! - "I am a teacher, I am a." - Look. - Just leave me alone. - That's why we come here, to ask questions. - Leave me alone, okay? Please just leave me alone. - You don't have to talk about it. - You don't have to. - Shit. - What's your reaction to what just happened? How are you feeling towards Jennifer? - I feel sorry for her, and I, I feel guilty that we pushed her. - Will you help me, Bud? - Guilty, that we pushed her? (Christine gasping) She's been here for eight months. I'm surprised she said anything. I'm surprised we did anything here, actually. (chuckling) Were you aware like, you know, we were helping you along, and working together and everything? We weren't so cold and detached. I was impressed, but it sort of embarrasses me also, because I, having ignored you the other evening at the restaurant. - Oh, I didn't know you two were dating. - No, my wife and I were out dancing, breaking it up. And we stopped in this restaurant, and Pete and his wife were in there. - Oh yeah, what does she look like? Teased hair, anklets? - Yeah. (group members laughing) - Well your, your basic ah, stewardess. Something you'd find in Woolworth's. No, very lovely, very warm. But I was laboring under a bad thing, because there I was, Charlie patient. And immediately I thought that you and your wife must have some sort of in-jokes about your patients. And besides that, you were quarreling quite a bit. - You know- - Just slammed down the menu with such passion I- - I noticed- - Just had to turn away. - I noticed you in the restaurant coming towards my table. - Great. - I turned around to look at you, and you turned away and you walked out. - Well, I thought you were quarreling. - I couldn't make any sense? - He didn't wanna bust up a hot argument. - Okay. - It seemed to be going so well. - Okay, even if we were quarreling, why would that, why would that freak you out? - I guess I've had enough of hearing people quarrel, you know? Even though I have admired it from afar, and I always know that, I guess you have to care for somebody to really quarrel. But my folks used to quarrel. Not a lot, but it was an event, right? I don't know, he'd get mad over a bent can of peas in the front row or something, and he would brood for a couple days, and all of a sudden all hell would break loose, and I end up in the toilet, shaking. But I finally realized that it was a fertility rite, you know? But still, I always felt that, I didn't know if it was gonna break up, or I had done something wrong or, it scared me. - You mean, so that my quarreling with my wife reminded you of your family's quarreling, and that's what bugged you? - It's just something that, I don't know, that scares me. I always, I don't know, I guess when you're a kid, you always think it's your fault when your folks are quarreling or something. I don't what it is it's, I don't know. - So he could punch your mother, right? Or walk out on you. - Sure. - That's scary, that's scary. - So the scary part then is like a, a sort of a feeling of your family falling apart? Sensing that your family's- - Family, anything, a group. - Or a group? - Sure. - Are you on medication, Chris? - Oh, I am feeling no pain, and neither is any baby. - What do you mean, baby? How do you know it's not feeling any pain? - There isn't gonna be any baby. - Honey, you don't get that size 'cause you're not having a baby. I mean, you are having a baby, that's a fact. - That's a fact, you want another fact? It's dead. - Oh, such drama. It's not dead. - It is. - Christine, why do you refuse to believe it's gonna live? - 'Cause the damage has been done. I've been doing it to myself all along. - What? - I'm still shooting. - Lovely. - On top of the medication? That's very good. It's not like, you know, you don't have any money. I mean, your father would give you bread, a place to stay. I mean, it's not like you're wandering around in a gutter someplace. - You get your big old private room in the hospital, you know? - That's one thing about rich people. They have terrific places where you can go and dry out. You can have nurses around the clock, basking you with cold water, understand? We're tired of listening to your junkie babble, man. - Believe me I was, I was tired of it the day I came here. I got a guest house over the garage, and I can go live up there and have a maid come and shoot me and the baby up. - Oh, you're such a comedian. You, you, it seems to me you can, for once in your life, you've got a decision to make, all by yourself. You're the only one that can make it. So why don't you just make it, instead of, instead of carrying on like some lunatic heroin freak, man. - That's great, sticks and stones. That's it, break my bones, beat the shit outta me. - Chris, you know I'd do it right now, if I thought it'd do you any good. - Can you dig that we don't enjoy having you come week after week after week, cranking out your, your litany, your newsletter of despair? And we're standing around watching you kill a baby. - What could she do, Bill? - I'll tell you what you can do. You can make up your mind right now to kick. You can make that decision, you can just make that decision. And, and I'll sit here in this room with you. I'll, I'll stay in this house with you. I'll take you home to my house. I'll sit with you for a week, two weeks, whatever it takes. But I cannot leave here knowing that you're, that you're gonna be shooting because, because I can't live with myself knowing, it makes me feel like a murderer, man. - Don't feel guilty for me. I don't want anybody's guilt. - Guilt? I feel responsible for you, I care about you. I, I, I don't wanna leave here knowing that you've, you're gonna piss your life away. Do you understand what I'm saying? - Chris, I wonder if you've been able to hear any of the things Bill's been trying to say to you? I wonder if you have any awareness of the way the group feels about you, or how they see you. - Does the group have any awareness of how I see them? - Chris, just how do you see us? - Do you really wanna know? Who do I start with? - I don't care, just get into it. - It's like a fairy tale. I mean like, you're all sitting around, and you're talking about your progress. It's like outta that, that thing. What's that, the last scene outta "The Wizard of Oz", you know? Like, they're all standing around and they all have their parts, and now they can go home. You're like the Tin Man. (chuckling) Bill, you finally realized that you have a heart, but it prefers men, accept it. Scarecrow, that's you. Now you have your own brain, you're thinking for yourself. Mm, Glen ah, Cowardly Lion. You know, you need all those people around you all the time for your courage. But now you're out on your own, and you got your own roar, you know? - Chris, how would you like to know how the group feels about you? - And you were the great Oz, until somebody pulled the curtain. - Do you wanna know how the group feels about you? - Yeah, I can hear you, over and out. How are you feeling, group? - Forgive me I, I resented you because your parents gave you everything and mine didn't. But you're more than you think you are. And what you said before about my just having to accept, it was groovy, thank you. - Okay, you're shooting. I don't know if you're expecting medals, or something like that. There's always somebody who's done it better. I went through a time when was doing it. I didn't care, right? It wasn't like a sunny day and brass bands and I cared. And the train was there every day, and it's hard, but ah, maybe I got tired. Maybe I got tired of rotting something away in me that was good, you know? You gotta find that. - I have something I wanna say to Jennifer. We, I don't know. I just became like everybody else, you know? I, I pushed you. And but I, I didn't mean to hurt you. You know I just, I just meant to tell you that it's okay to open up, you know? Like, especially here, because you know, we're all in the same boat, nobody's to get you. - Yeah Jennifer, I think the most important thing that people can do, you know, is communicate feelings, you know? Even if it is like Dale and I. You know, we fight a lot, but at least we're getting out what we feel. - Bill, you're great, but you're a puppy dog, man. You'll do anything just to fit in, you know? I, sometimes I think that you even tried to kill yourself just because you didn't fit in with whatever you thought you had to fit in with. But if you have to give up your sensitive feelings just to fit in with people, I don't think that's worth it. And they're always willing to take them away from you. - Dale um, I really can't say that I like you, you know? 'Cause I think you've been using, you know, Black people for your own thing. But you are a strong person, got a lot of energy. And whenever, you know, direct that energy on yourself, instead of worrying about everybody else, you're gonna be together. - I have so much to say to you I, but I can't even say anything, except I wish you'd learn to lose. Because like, when you're wrong, you fight with such vehemence, even though you know you're wrong. And I just can't comprehend what this incredible pride is all about. - Your pride, God, it's all you got left. Cops got guns, all people got left is pride. I love pride. When I first got here man, you know, like I always, I identified with you a lot. It was easiest. I've never taken as much punishment as you have man, on any level. Being a Black man, I would never know what it's like, and I don't even really care to get into it. But what I've learned from you, and you've never known it, is a music. God, when you get loose, when you don't worry about what you're saying, your instincts or anything like that. You're mad, you're apologizing, anything. It's just, it's, it's such a music. - I'm gonna let you have it, because, like I know if I came to the next marathon and said, "Oh, I've been putting you on this whole time. I'm not a fag, I never have been, it's just been an act," there'd be some basis for friendship. So there's a stupid barrier that exists between us, based on, I don't even know what, I don't even understand what. And uh, like, I really love you. I don't mean sexually, so I don't get excited. I mean, I don't know, I've seen you, and I've seen you feel towards me. So cut the bullshit. - Pete, you're just like Jennifer, I don't know thing about you, I don't know. I don't know if I should or not, I mean, but it bothers me, you know? That I don't know anything about you. - Well- - But I don't know whether I love you or I hate you or, but I guess you've handled us, you've handled me anyway, pretty well. - Me too. I'm gonna be honest. I think when I first came here. I didn't like you, so I didn't like you at all, 'cause I thought you were, you know, playing this image, what doctors are supposed to be. Sorta cold and detached, and the more I came and the more I got to know you, I found out that, that's just the way you are. (Bud and Christine laughing) So it's cool, cat. You're okay, doc. Don't leave me hanging, mother. (soft gentle poignant music) (soft gentle poignant music continues) (soft gentle poignant music continues)
