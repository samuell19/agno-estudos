Sole? After I go see Professor Kanem. Kanem? It reads like a novel, Professor Kanem. Call me, Helene. Okay. I want-- just one second. You know I went to the village and we had goat and chicken and they are so excited for me to bring folks to Sierra Leon. Since we met, that's the only thing I can think about. How's your father doing? Um, I mean, he's in a lot of pain, but that's expected at this stage, so. Sole, you know I really want you to go on this trip, right? You know, I, I really do. But there will be other trips if you're not able to make this one. - Sweetie, I just, I don't want you to regret taking the trip. - Oh, I wouldn't. Why, why would I regret going to Sierra Leon with you? I just don't want anything distracting you from your father. But I've already taken a year off to focus on him. And you don't know how much longer you'll have with him. See there, you kissed your teeth. I should never have taught you how to kiss your teeth. He, he would want me to take this trip with you. Did you ask him if I could go to Sierra Leone with Dr. Kanem? He's still not responsive, honey. Being with her, being with your family, being in a different place may be the best thing for you right now. What was I thinking? I should've planned for this better. You know, you may like it, and before you know it, you'll be back in New York starting your freshman year. You'll be right back here. I can get her to sign me over to you. - If I do that then-- - Sole, sweetie. Why is he sending me to live with someone - I've never even met before? - She's your grandmother. She's your family, and you need to be with her right now. I'm so sorry, sweetie. Tada, darling! Welcome to your new home. What do you think? I know it's, uh, not quite the same as New York, but uh, you're gonna love it. What is that? Um, it's a transfer of guardianship. You and your husband were really kind to take me in, but you really didn't have to do that. I, um, yeah, actually my professor, uh-- Husband? Aw, god bless your heart. Pastor Davis and I are very close and loving friends. Oh, okay. Look at that skin. - Now what foundation are you wearing? - I'm not wearing any makeup. Oh my, I could never leave the house without my face. Arm, please, yeah, I-- Painless, I need your opinion. There's this, hm? I'm probably not the best person to ask. Um, so yeah, do you mind signing over guardianship to Helene-- - You don't wanna live with me? - Well, it's not that. It's just I thought after daddy passed that naturally I'd stay with Helene, because she's actually gonna be professor - this fall, so it just-- - Darling. You need to be with family, not a professor at times like this. - No. - She's not just my professor. She's... my best friend, so um-- Your best friend is your professor? Well I, I know, I don't know you, but I wanna get to know you. We, we can still get to know each other. It's just that, it's, just we've been planning this trip for like, most of the year and the timing isn't-- I'm sorry, Sole, but I'm not turning you over to someone I don't know. Daddy knew her. - She's not a stranger. - Yeah, and he chose me. Look, we'll have fun here, you'll see. Darling? In this house we don't lock doors. I want you to come and meet some of my friends. Okay. Oh, why not a dress? Well, the only dress I have is the one I wore to the funeral, so. Oh, well we have to have a shopping spree. Alright, hurry. Just right. - Hi, girls. - Hi. Granddaughter! Hi. I'm Nance. This is my daughter, Gilda. Hi Sole. This must be super different from New York, huh? Oh, Pastor Davis is already inside. We've been discussing the renovations for the church. Oh, okay. Yeah. - Lord, help me to pray for her. - Hey, neighbor. Don't engage with that girl. You don't wanna talk today? No, no, no, seriously, - I think you have something to say. What was that? - Let's just go inside. You'd think she could have more respect for Tanya's house. - Who's Tanya? - Her grandmother. Rest her soul. But I know that Tanya did not leave her that house for that girl to destroy. - Where's her mother? - None of us know. I just don't know what she's gonna do when that life insurance money runs out. There's some girls in our youth group, they would love to take you shopping. So Sole, so Sole, what was it like - meeting your grandmother for the first time? - It was fine. Well I discovered that Miss Sole here is exceptionally smart and would've started college at 16, but she took a year off because of her father. Irene tells me that you're interested in helping children in Africa. I wanna help children that have been affected by war. Um, Dr. Helene Kanem, she's actually gonna be my professor this fall at Columbia, and working with her will pretty much automatically put me in the top 10% of candidates to volunteer at the UN, so. You know, we have decided to join our sister congregation in their missionary trip. We are gonna be fundraising together, and on your 18th birthday we are going to - West Africa! - West Africa! We can do a walk-a-thon for the missionary trip. Exercising and raising money at the same time. Oh, well sweetheart must be so excited that she hasn't touched a thing on her plate. I'm vegan. Oh, now our girlfriend Louise did that diet, right, and she what, she lost about 30 pounds or something like that. Darling, how much weight have you lost? I'm getting ready to get after it, and this is gonna be cardio-intensive, you guys. - Here we go. - Legs are gonna be burning. Heart rates are gonna be up. You're doing great. Next we're gonna go with a forward and backward hop. $800? - Just stay. - No, fuck you! It's just, just stay. Why, I can't, I can't. - I haven't slept for two days, just let me let-- don't leave. - Jasmine, just go to sleep. - Don't leave - Oh my God. Just stay, please. Are you fucking gonna leave? You're gonna fucking leave? - Jasmine. - Then fucking go, then go! Go, fuck you! I'm just never gonna get to know her or anything. It's terrible! Here, give me your glass, give me your glass. Oh, thank you. You'll get to know her. Whoa, and I'll get that, don't you worry. I got it, I got it. Would you stop? Would you stop? - What is wrong with you? - Look, you've got to - remember this. - What? Irene, she's not Pearl, and you're not who you used to be. Knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world. And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace who has called you to His eternal glory in Christ will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you. First Peter 5, 9-10. Why don't we take a break? How did it go this morning? We had a very interesting discussion. It was about faith. I don't understand how she doesn't believe there's anything out there. I mean, no God? Sole. Father, why don't you give us a minute? Would you please stop telling people you don't believe in God? - In my family, we believe in God. - I'm an atheist. Well you wanna do all those things for people in Africa. Missionary trips are actually against everything I believe in. Pastor, would you please tell me what 17-year-old really knows what they wanna believe in. Many 17-year-olds are responsible for changing society based on things they believe in. Dr. Kanem even says society needs to tune into the youth more, - and that's why if you-- - I could care less about what that professor of yours has to say about anything. Okay, ladies, I think that your, your grandmother is just recalling a similar discussion she had with your mother years ago. Sweetheart, it's wonderful that you found something to believe in, but I just wanna make sure that you believe in what's right. How is she so much like her? We have breakfast, she won't talk. We have lunch, she won't talk. All I want is just to have my life, that's all, but here she comes, Pearl number two, just stirring up trouble just like her mother but fatter. Irene. - What? - No. Now you know the Lord never puts more on us than we can bear. Well I can't bear this, Clay, I can't do it. - Come on. - Huh? - Come on. - Alright. - Okay? - Mm-hm. - Could you make me another martini, darling? - Yeah. Who are you? - Hi, I'm from next door, I-- - Really, Erica? Just because I fucked somebody else last week. Is he okay? Yeah, he's just meditating away his fucked up father. He hasn't even noticed I haven't been home this whole week. You can stay here with me as long as you want. Nicotine? Nicotine is a drug too. What is that? It's weed. People don't die from weed. Are you going over to Suzy's house? You know, fucking her isn't gonna make you feel better. You know that, right? Are you really leaving? Look, you can fucking smoke! Why are you leaving? Just stay, chill, just stay. - Wait, wait. - No. What's your name? Guedado. Hey, Guedado. Um, hi, I'm Sole. And actually I need your help with-- - Both of you, I need your help with something. - With what? Okay, this is gonna sound a little weird, but I need to form a group. I'm trying to get this scholarship thing so I can get back to New York. - It's due in a few days and-- - New York? - I'm already in a band. - Is that where you're from? Uh, yeah, um, it's, it's not a band. It's, it's more like a protest performance group. - Have you heard of Pussy Riot? - Yeah. Yeah, so you would get to protest against anything that pisses you off, child soldiers, girls getting raped in wars, uh, environmental issues, capitalism, uh, Christianity, just any-- - What's wrong with Christianity? - You know what? I would like to protest DJs who don't call you back when you ask to be one of their tour dancers. Wow. Okay. Sure, but we'd have to politically contextualize that so it doesn't sound so PMS-y. Oh my god, I would do whatever you want, if we can call ourselves PMS-y. PMS-y? PMS. It's kind of feminist. Okay, fine. Let's celebrate. - Wait, but, we haven't done anything yet. - Yeah. ♪ Ladies! Pass me a drink I'm important ♪ ♪ Kisses on the cheek I'm important ♪ ♪ Mirrors on my hand I'm important ♪ ♪ I'm coming through, bitch I'm important ♪ ♪ 30 on the chain I'm important ♪ ♪ Nigga where the champagne I'm pouring ♪ ♪ You already know I'm important ♪ Los Angeles, what's up? Yo, I got great news. So, my band just went on European tour today, Picked a great group of backup dancers to go with us. Mya, Tima and Neveen. Give it up, give it up, give it up! Step. Oh God. Okay, one second. Alright, here you go. Can you just stay? - It's almost 5:00 a.m. - It's, it's okay. You probably have other things to do than hang out with me. No, I just, I can't get caught. You can sleep well, it's fine. Ow! Are you like serious about this PMS thing? Yeah, pretty serious. You know, your girlfriend's dumb. She's not my girlfriend anymore. - And she's dumb. - Okay. What's your story with witch next door? Is that like your grandmother or something? She is my mom's mother, but she disowned my mom. My mom died in childbirth, and my dad recently died. Um, and since I'm not 18, they... - Death, death. - ...sent me to live with - my last living relative. - Death. And that's her, so. Fuck life. Here. Why don't we get you to bed? No, no. I don't wanna sleep. I just, I'll go get you some water. Will you just lay with me for a little bit? Please, I won't try anything, I swear. Stop! Look, I'll stay for a little while longer, okay? Can't be a dancer with these. You can for PMS. Doesn't it hurt? It feels good at first. Just like sex. Thanks for looking after her. What else makes you feel better? Jack Daniels, but you took that away from me. And dancing. One of Africa's most vicious civil wars has burst open. The fighters are often young orphans, like this 12-year-old boy. He's fighting to revenge the death of his father. Dissidents are silenced. But people are still finding ways to protest. Street art has gone viral. This whole procession is long overdue, because this thing has been happening for long. Please leave your message. What were you doing? I called you like three times. Why are you so late? What are you gonna be doing? I don't know how to sing or dance or play an instrument, so you guys are my only hope. Come on. Just let the music tell you what to do. Hey, Jazz, come on. Draw. I don't-- Draw. Stop being awkward. Just draw. Are those severed limbs? I see a face in there too, you know. This isn't some dumb art school application. It has to relate specifically to my praxis essay. Praxis? Practice you mean? Praxis. It's when you connect an intellectual idea with on-the-ground service. For example, okay, Walter Rodney, he's-- I don't get it. PMS has to relate specifically to issues going on in this community. Like what, child soldiers in Ladera Heights? No, we have to raise awareness, connect the, you know, the violence that people our age deal with over here with the stuff that's going on over there. Why does it matter to you? How can you not care? They have both of their parents taken away from them. That's how it happens. Like you, all three of us, death has kissed our lives. We're a motherless trio. So, you are an organizer with people your own age, but you are making music and art and hanging out? California has transformed you. I, I don't, I don't recognize you. - This is amazing. - I can't stay here. I'm coming back to New York. New York's here. New York's been here. I'll be here. Alright girls, keep it moving. Woo! Yeah. Woo! No texting. Your professor friend can wait. Oh, now Keena and, um, Martha have to head back, right? They have to take care of some business. Can I hang out with you guys? Oh, well, if you're gonna do that, here's a credit card, just in case you wanna go shopping. I'm feeling a little lightheaded, so um, I think I'm gonna stay back and grab something to eat. Did you really wanna hang out with us or did you just say that? - Well-- - It's okay, we won't tell. I appreciate that. I just, I need to study for something. - Study? - College prep stuff. Yo! Hey! I've been texting you. Where were you? Oh. Hanging out with these fine young Christians, wow. Nice getup girls. Super bright and, yeah. - Um, okay, so I-- - Come on. I just need to study for something. Okay then, fuck you too then. You have a fucking great day, girls. She's crazy, you know. No, like crazy. Um, sorry, I just didn't want them to tell Irene. - Whatever. - Well, I'm here now, so. - I'm not doing your stupid PMS. - Why are you so angry? No, stop talking, stop talking! That was some fake shit and you know it! - Let's go, let's go. -You know it, continue... - What are you talking about? Shut the fuck up. Stop, I'm sick of this shit. Lefa and I. Stop. I wish my dad was dead. It's okay, it's true. Except it's not. You ever wonder what it would be like if your mom was still alive. I don't think it's productive to think like that. Why not? Because it doesn't help anyone. You would definitely not be here if your dad didn't die. Okay, um, can we go now? I need to use the bathroom. Piss or poop? Number one, but... Look, we should probably get going anyway. We needed to get started on the PMS stuff, right? No, yeah, we definitely do. - Don't you need to pee? - Oh. You never had a boyfriend? No. You just gotta shake it off. Like this, shake it. - Shake it, shake it. - I just got some on my leg. Who cares, it's just pee. Ever had a girlfriend? No. I bet you've never even been kissed. You kissed me, the other night at the party. I did? Yeah. Well that doesn't count. You can thank your dad for dying, because you are gonna kiss Guedado. Stop. You are! It's gonna happen soon! I want your soul, Sole. - I don't wanna wear a mask. - Um, what? Why am I protesting and all I wanna do is dance. Um, but you are dancing. No, I'm dancing in something that only benefits you. Oy, Jasmine. - This means a lot to her. Look. - Oh my god, put that back. Put it back, what are you doing? Oh my god. - Maybe it'll help with your... - My what? You know, you said dancing makes you feel good. Come on, Jazz. Alright, let's just try it at the church tomorrow. Really? Okay, um, I promise it'll be fun. I always have fun. Just a kiss goodbye. Would you, a little one? Little one. I'll do whatever you say. Yeah. Oh I'd like to see the day. Oh shut up and kiss me. - You tease me, that's not fair! - I'm out. Catch you later. Clay, I won't do anything. I miss you when you're gone, please. That was too easy. You know I'm easy. No, you know I'm easy. I've-- hands to myself. Honestly. Oh-ho! Technical. I promise I won't do anything. I miss you when you're gone, please. You're so cute. Just makes my day go better. It's all gonna work. It's all gonna work. - It's working. - It's working. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay! Did we make too much noise? Oh, oh yeah. Did I? What the fuck is up? Leave a message. Where's Jasmine? She's, she's not picking up her phone, and she's not at home. You just wanna do this another day or what? No. You sure? Yes! Turn around. Turn around. - Right there. Okay. - No, ah. Put this one instead. - Good? - Okay. - That right? - No, it's spinning around, it's the-- - Orange. - I don't know, this isn't... Just forget about it. It's not, it's not working. No, it's fine, look, alright. It's alright. Yeah? Hold your pen, it's fine. Would you fix your shirt at least. - Baby I -- - No, no, no, fix your tie. So, why was I here then? Because we were up late planning the fundraiser, and it was too dangerous for you to go home that time of night. - You got it all figured out. - I do. Oh, fuck baby, you made me late, they're gone! Shit, oh shit! I'll be back for you later. Allen and Crenshaw, okay? Come on. Allen and Crenshaw? What she going over to Allen and Cren-- - That's where my church is. - We better get over there. Sorry, I'm sorry! My phone died, his phone died. Um, we have a cameraman, okay. Um, do, do you have my outfit? It's in the car. What's the point? See, it's good. Fuck. It's itchy. Yeah, right he's there and you're dancing and all of the posters and everything. Maybe just kind of make sure it's about the poster and turn it towards the camera. No, no, no, no, no, no! Jazz, no I don't-- you're taking away from what we're trying to talk about! What, you said it's a protest against whatever we wanted, so I'm protesting against slut-shaming. - Don't, - I know what I'm doing. It's the poster in front. - No, stop. - It's just not-- it can't-- It's not what I want. Are you getting this? Stop it, why are you doing this? It's not what it-- Jasmine Thompson, what would your grandmother say right now. - And Sole-- - Get all that mess down from my church. - Is this any way to thank me for taking you in. Is this how your father raised you? Oh my Lord. Clay, give my your phone, I'm calling the police. - ...indecent exposure -Please don't call the cops. Understand, it's plain as day. Let us-- protesting. What are you protesting? It's for my application. I have to make a video for-- - OK, I'm sorry, Irene-- - What type of education is it that your trying to get? Such embarrassing life. Clay, I'm so sorry. We are not going to talk. You see, no-- I-- You-- Come on, Jasmine. It's me. - What are you doing here? - I'm breaking you out of jail, Rapunzel, come on. It's pointless. Okay, then, I'll stay here. I'm sorry I fucked it up. I don't know what's wrong with me, I really wanted PMS to work. No, you didn't. Yes, I did. That's like, the most fun I've had in ages. Okay, it's late, Jasmine. - I'm tired. - Okay, then. I'll just stay here, keep you company. I don't need help sleeping. Your period. - Oh shit. - What are you doing? What the heck? I'm just trying to find underwear or a tampon or something. Thank you. What the fuck are these? You know what, Guedado, would probably be into these granny panties. Fucking ugly. - Guedado misses you. - Stop. You are so oblivious, he's into you. But I'm not his type. And what is his type, smarty pants? Guys into music like girls who look like -- - I'm calling the police. - She just came to give me my phone. - I will not have my granddaughter spoiled by you. - Get off me! - Get the fuck off me. - Irene! She's my friend. I am your legal guardian. And as long as you're under this roof, you do what I say, and right now I say you stay away from this girl. Fine, if she goes then I go. No, you-- You come back here. Go back to Pastor Davis, I know he's waiting for you in the room. Have sex. Oh my god, I was not expecting it to go down like that. Like at all. - Um? - Yeah, shut up. Shut up, I was leaving. Shut up, I don't want to hear it. What are you doing? Pow! Oh my God, when did you guys do this? Wow! What's this for? Mushroom tea ceremony. The feminine god. What's that? Just something we made up. To PMS, to the trio of motherless souls. Cheers. - Okay, now what happens? - dang. Is it gonna make me high? We are gonna make art, okay? And we are going to film this tonight and we are going to make the perfect PMS video - for your application. - Ok. I-- I don't think that -- - What are you protesting? - Death. - Oh my God. - You can't protest death, it's inevitable. Ready? I'm ready, I been ready. What are you protesting? Life. - You feel it, huh? - Yeah. I am the party kid. I am the party kid. I can taste every atom. I bet if you played, I could see your music on like-- Last one, the last one. Oh. Yes, yes, yes, yes. - Come on, please. - Come on, take it off, it feels good. Let me film you. I hated earlier today. Don't play, just wait, I'm sorry I was late. - I know. - I'm sorry, but, but I did my peak effort. I was-- I was trying to be subversive. I researched for you, and it's a traditional dance from the Ivory Coast. It's basically like twerking. It's nice. Should we be on some traditional African shit in it? To hell with the legacy of the chasm and patriarch, - patriarchy - Patriarchy. I know, I understand, I'm smart too, I get it. So, I just watched the video and it's risqué, you are vulnerable, you're showing yourself. Oh my God, the video is so cool. Take it off, it feels good. I'm free. Oh, I feel so free. Make the perfect PMS video for your application. They're giving you an interview, and I think once they talk to you, - they'll feel the same I feel. - It's good. We totally have to go shopping, we're gonna find you the most awesome outfit, okay? Sole, this is so cute. Try this on. Come on, try stuff on. Can you turn around? Who cares, it's just me. I need you to turn around. You are vulnerable, you're showing yourself. Take it off, it feels good. Do you need me to help you zip it? - It's not gonna zip. - It is. Just lift it up, it's okay. - Sole, babe. - Look at your butt. You can try on other things, look? This is-- This looks more, like, me. Hey, are you okay, here? You good? Look, I'm gonna take you to the best pizza place, and they have vegan pizza too, so. I need to find something to wear. - Okay, we'll just try another store. - I'm not going to find anything. Come on then, let's go get pizza. I don't want pizza! You talk with me for a bit? - Okay. - How does this grant work with your grandma? I just need to get it. M-hm, you'll get it. - You think so? - M-hm. You know, I admire the way you're going for what you want. If my dad didn't pay for NYU, I wouldn't think to do all this work for a scholarship. Thank you. I like you, Sole. I like you a lot. Don't die. He looked at me all funny. God, cause your hot. Oh, shit. Excuse me, sorry, man, excuse me, sorry. Excuse me, I didn't see you there. Hold it in, hold it in. I'm fucked up, smoking one joint. Wait, is this gonna make me hungry? Duh, it called the munchies. Oh um, I made a Pinterest board full of like different ideas and costumes. Don't fall on your pals. Oh my God, you're dying, you're dying. Okay, give it here. Cheers, cheers! Oh my God. Oh my god. Are you good? How come you're drinking? Didn't want to keep thinking about my interview. Hopefully, they'll see what I'm trying to do with PMS's, rooted in giving youth a voice. What are you thinking? I want to kiss you. Can I, I won't unless you're serious? - Hm. - Hm? Um... I think I need some water. - Don't you want-- - You're laughing at me. I'm not laugh-- I'm laughing with you. Looking at PMS, you can see that-- Looking at PMS, each of us-- You can see that-- Approaches the images differently-- If I receive this grant, when I travel to Sierra Leone, It won't just be me - telling them how to-- - Can we order pizza sometimes. You can order it, I'm doing a cleanse to clear up my mind. If I receive this grant, when I travel to Sierra Leone, Looking at PMS, you can see, each of us approaches the-- A real arcanum. Oh! Why don't you just ask her. I'm surrendering, I'm not going to force her to come back here. Irene, stop. Oh. Lord, help me to let it go. You know, I know that He's going to bring her back to me. And-- Sole. Sole. You're hot. They are going to love you. Ok. Ow. As Dr. Helene Kanem would say, practice is worth all the gifts. Okay, um, my father was a strong believer that the African should be at the head of their own development. The stuff we need connected-- ...is where it all begins -- My father-- ♪ -Did you go downtown? ♪ -Yes ma'am! ♪ ♪ -Did you see my Brown? - Yes ma'am! ♪ ♪ -Did he buy me any shoes? - Yes, ma'am! ♪ ♪ Rockin' shoes? ♪ ♪ -In the bare rain? ♪ ♪ -Yes ma'am! ♪ ♪ Which way did he go? ♪ Sole? - Do you feel like you can talk to me about stuff? - Hmm? Do you feel like you can talk to me about stuff? Yeah, sure. Okay, praxis, praxis, praxis. What is that piss? When the last time you had real food? It's an energy cleanse, you should try it. Um, no. Sole. Sole. Look. You stopped? Yeah. Okay. If we tie in autonomy with praxis, then I can-- I was gonna save this for a surprise, but I might be going to New York. Okay, praxis, praxis. I just submitted the PMS footage and I'm up for a scholarship. What? Yeah, I got an audition. It's in a week. You submitted my footage. Okay, see, look, this is-- you're not eating and you're acting really strange, really weird. - I'm the weird one? Wow! - Yes, you are the weird one. - You're acting weird. - I'm not the one with scars all over my body. I can't believe-- I found your pills. You went through my shit? What are they? I ca-- I can't believe you went through my shit. I didn't do it on purpose. - Shut up! Shut up! - I found them. I-- I can't. Sole. Fuck. Can I have a cigarette? I'm worried about you, you know. Wait, wait, wait. What happened with Jasmine? You're worried about Jasmine. - Not like this, okay. - What? Come on, stop, stop. Forget it. Don't touch me. Sole, what the hell? You're such a hypocrite. What are you talking about? You're a good liar, but your dick isn't. Fuck you, you never liked me. I do like you, I just want to talk right now. Why does everybody want to fucking talk? Huh? If you come any closer, I'll scream. Sole. Sole, what did you take? What did you take? Okay, she opened her eyes a little bit. I can't tell is she's-- should we take her to the hospital? Here we go. Thank you, darling. Oh, phone, am I blowing up. Honey, it's Sole. - Hello. - Pastor Davis, it's Jasmine, I found Sole and she's passed out and I don't, I don't know. Well, come on, come on. Please leave your message. She's just crying out for help. You need to ask the Lord what to do. I did ask the Lord. I've asked the Lord over and over again. I was praying for Pearl, I've been praying for Sole. But I know, I know that faith without works is that I just don't know what to do. Lord God you are my witness, I have asked you, I need to do something, I need to do something, I just don't know. Sole, you're impressive. Dr. Kanem is right, you seem older than you are. Thank you. Um, Dr. Kanem's work is really important to me, and I am really eager to continue growing and learning from her as much as possible. Okay, well, we spoke about your project, your future visions. Tell me about your weaknesses, what is it that you grapple with? Weaknesses? I-- I tend to think I don't need anyone. But... I need... I mean, we all need someone. That is profound. Well, last few questions from me, that's it. Thank you, I appreciate the opportunity. Don't look so disappointed, you got it. I have the grant? Thank you. Thanks. Um.. Okay, bye. What the fuck is up, leave a message. Hey, um... I got the grant. Did you go to your audition? I-- I hope it went well. Don't you have an audition today? - Hm? - The audition? No, no, no, no, that's tomorrow. Where are you going? Where are you going? Can I ask you a question? Why didn't you want me to be on your tour? Give me your phone, trade. You said your audition was tomorrow, but your phone calendar says - it was 30 minutes ago. - Okay. So you don't show up for yourself, so why do you expect me to think that you would show up for me on tour? Nobody takes care of me but me, and you know that. Jasmine, that is not true as long as I've known you. I mean, you have to put out for yourself. - You gotta do it, you gotta go for it. -Mhm. Otherwise, what am I supposed to think. You know? Nah, you got a missed call from Sole. Talk to me Sole, how bad is it? Are you bulimic? Do I look bulimic, Irene? Let me help you, please. I need you to back off. Oh my fucking gosh, wow. We can get a good doctor, a good therapist, - Sometimes God has other plans. - Fuck God, Irene. I am so sorry. - You just-- stop, okay you're not my mother. - I'm still your family. Leave me alone, I want to get in the house, you don't get it. Sweetheart, we're all we have. It isn't fair. I know it's not fair, I know it's not fair, it's not fair. I don't-- I don't want you to hug me, just don't. I know this is hard, darling. I'm angry too, I'm angry too. Oh, you can my dear, yeah, come. I just want my dad. I know, I am here. - I'm here. - I don't want to be here, Irene. I know you don't. - No, I-- - You want to be in New York. And I'm not going to stop you. You won't? I'm going to go everything that I can to help you. Why? I want you to be happy. I want you to be at peace. And you know what? Maybe I was wrong. Maybe I can grow too. I can learn too. Please give me a chance. Was my mother really bulimic? Yes. I've never eaten out of the trash before, I swear. And I don't want to do it again. Somethings wrong with me, somethings happening to me. And I'm scared. I can't stop eating. I am here with you now. We could deal, now that I'm here. I am here now, darling. I'm here now.
