THE GUARD There he goes. The beautiful commander. If only I'd meet him on the street. - God forbid. Why god forbid? If we met, he's say: Private Khaustov. And I'd say: Who are you, staff sergeant? Who are you? He's say: But aren't you Private Khaustov? I'd say: Yes, I am Khaustov. But who are you, staff sergeant? Hold this. Private Khaustov! I am Private Khaustov. But who are you, staff sergeant? Enough. - Why enough? Private Khaustov! I am Private Khaustov, and you? Who are you, staff sergeant? And who am I? You are the staff sergeant, presently second-in-command to Sergeant Zhokhin. For me to come up to you on the street, who must you become, Private Khaustov? An outstanding pupil of political and military training, staff sergeant. Take the guard's post. - Affirmative. A prick of a commander. - What? You think the army is like honey, kid? What's wrong? What's up? - Nothing. What's up with you? Guys? Forget it, I think he already shat himself, so let him go. Just you wait, boys. I am sorry, captain. They inscribed all kinds of filth, so we plastered it up. About us? About you. Staff sergeant, the toilet bowl is missing. Captain, do we have a toilet bowl? - You'll get one. Why are you still here? Sorry, staff sergeant. Rookies. Where am I? What were you before the army, Nishinkin? It's Nishenkin, staff sergeant. So? I was a domestic fart. Remember that more often. It will help you get along with new soldiers. Affirmative. I will keep that in mind. Now you're dismissed, dear. Don't be sad, my dear friend. When spring comes, we'll be discharged. Hello children. Kolya, let's put the suitcase on the main rack. Lazy dogs. A loading engagement. Now you'll sweat. The sooner the better. Maybe make them get the boxes? Did you check the wagon? We did, why? We don't have any coal. We have coal. No, we don't. Nikolai, we do have coals. No, we don't have coals. Kolya, let me have a bite. - Kolya needs the vitamins himself.

Meanwhile, they're gorging on homemade salo. I saw it myself. Is the food ready, Luzhin? Did you prepare the food yet? I brought it in thermoses from the division. Khaustov, let's move on. By requests of Private First Class Korchenuk, we will sing... What's wrong with you, kid? Sorry, Boris Sergeyevich, I forgot. By requests of PVT First Class Korchenuk and Boris Sergeyevich, we will sing: "Don't be sad, I am not crying". Performance by Private Khaustov. I am not sorry, I am not calling you, I am not crying for you. Everything will pass like the smoke of apple trees. Look, I am captured by gold. I will never be young again. Which cell? - Fifth. Hands. Follow me. Noise in cells. Can you sing at least one song to the end? I can. - Show me. I am sitting in the sun. And I am looking at the sun. It's only me, sitting here, and looking at the sun. Sing "The Dischargee" No need. Go on, "The Dischargee." Buzz off, I said. We don't want to carry your heavy burdens on our shoulders. Take the boots and the uniform, take it away. And the badges and the insignias, take it all back! We don't need, we don't need, we don't need awards. I want to see my bride! And I want my wife. I want to go home. Come on, give us "The Dischargee"! "The Dischargee" now! And do you sing "The Dischargee"? - What for? Well? Give us "The Dischargee"! You know where the bucket with rags is? - Yes. - And the toilet? - Yes. I'll be surprised by how clean it is in 5 minutes. All washed and shiny. Detailing for guard. - This isn't an order but a plea. I can't say no, Boris Sergeyevich. - Don't even try! You think you are scrubbing the head? - Negative, I am improving my character. That's right. You'll thank me later. Thank you very much. - You're welcome. Clean this better. How do you youngsters manage to piss outside such a large bowl? Not enough practice. You should share your know-how, Boris Sergeyevich. What the hell? My know-how. What do you want? I want to make a human out of you. A human? And who am I then? When war begins, Boris Sergeyevich will be defending his homeland. And what will you be doing? Scrubbing toilets. So start practicing. When war starts, Boris Sergeyevich will be defending his homeland. And what will you be doing? I will be scrubbing toilets. It's too soon for you to be ogling the dischargee ruler. You need a measuring tape of 10 meters. Six meters and forty eight centimeters. Private Khaustov? - Yes? You drumhead, sound the lights-out. Faster. Boom chik chik chirik ku ku... Why were you late for lights-out call, Private Iveren? - I was in the bathroom. I don't care where you were, I am asking why were you late for lights-out? I thought... Think what you want, but follow orders. You're in the army, kid, got it? Why were you late for lights-out, dear Iveren? Enough, Zhokhin. Khaustov, lights-out. - Khaustov, dismissed. Private Iveren will be sounding lights-out until the end of the guard. Affirmative. Boom chik chik chirik ku ku, The old man will be discharged soon. Good night, old timers, discharge is one day closer. Rest and sleep and wait for discharge. How many more days of service? - 36 days. Let them pass by quickly. Old timers, a day has gone by.

Thank God I wasn't killed in action. Tomorrow, on guard again. Yes, very funny. I heard your aren't getting along? We are, but in a non-regulatory way. Chief, how about a trip to the loo? I read your request for a transfer to a different subdivision. The decision on your request is not in my jurisdiction. Forward. Stop. I will escort myself. Forward. Hold still. Enter. Well, Vislikoev. Fourth cell. This one, middle bunk, on the left. No, right, on the right. Get up. No, the one at the end. - Back to rest. Get up. Out. Convict? Convict Vislikoev, article 145, 7 years. Forward. Hands. Will you give it up voluntarily? - I don't understand, chief. Mouth. Wider. Sit. Stand. Sit. Stand. Sit. Stand. Sit. Stand. Hands behind your back. As you were, Terezko. Sit. Stand. Sit. Stand. Legs together. Sit. Stand. Sit. Stand. Legs together. Sit. Scumbags! Scumbags! Save your little head. 26, 27, 28. Iveren, sign. Here. Where was he taking so much money? - Just sign. They'll figure it out without you. Can we boil some tea, boss? Yes. Khaustov, rise the relief. Rise it! Good morning. Private Khaustov, double extra duty for sleeping on the watch. - Affirmative. Comrade lance-corporal, no incidents during my watch. Watchman of the first post, Private Iveren. - Good boy. So, sonny, you were supposed to wake me up at 3 o'clock. You are a decent lad. If it goes on like this, you will do well. Go prepare to take these morons to the shitter. Forward. Forward. Forward. Forward. Next. Forward. Forward. Forward. Next. Forward. Forward. Go. Forward. Forward. Forward. Disgusting hound! Hands. Hands, bitch, hold still. Get lost. - But he's sick!

You can go, I'll do the rest myself. Ibragimov? The porridge is boiling. Next. Go. Next. Go. Finish up. Exit. Go. Move it. Will you be horsing around for much longer? You can show us how to be productive. From where did your arms grow, Iveren? Out of my ass, of course. Just what I thought. Give it to me. Watch and learn. Private Khaustov? - Yes. Are you learning? - Yes. That's good. Then your arms will also grow where they should. Just like our comrade's. Your tongues should be shortened, newbies. Give it to me. You shouldn't have. - Too late. Warden - Must - Watchfully - Guard Firmly - Defend - His - Station Fulfill - Duties - Buoyantly Without - Distraction Never - Give - Away - Your - Gun Not Even - To - People - Who (Louder) - Abide - To - Prescribed Directions - Attentively - Watch You are as full of pride, Iveren, as you are full of shit. - Affirmative. One should live according to the circumstances. But you are always asking for trouble. Got too many principles? Yes, I have principles. It's good to have principles. But it's too soon for you to have any. Understood? - Affirmative. Puts 'em there. You mean "put them here" What are you so freaking smart? Can't complain. You know, Kolya Mazov is a nice guy. And if you speak to him politely, he will understand you. Understood, soldier? - Affirmative. There you go. Look! When did you join the tank corps? I can't hear you. - Enough already. What type of a tank did you ride? Afraid you won't make it home in your own uniform? Ibragimov! Some tankist! Renat, hurry up. What's going on there? - Don't know. What's all the racket? - Quiet, breathe sideways. Understood. - Good. He's high. Nothing. To the bunk, raise it. Nothing. If they had something, they passed it along already. And what about you? - Nothing here. Clean up the toilet. So? Who's got the grass? I don't know, chief. I don't know where it comes from, I just don't know. Fess up. Chief, I don't fucking know! If you don't believe it, consider it a fairytale. Noise in the cells! Asshole. Show me. Nishchenkin! You still haven't learned the text. Start over. Do you see the wrinkles? Fix it. What's this Tibri-Libri? I didn't tell you to stop. You don't know how to do anything. How did you even manage to keep a wife? His neighbor must have helped. Isn't that so, Khaustov? So, Khaustov? Stop singing. How is your wife, Khaustov? Is she nice? She's nice, isn't she? Does she do it well? Khaustov? I am asking you, does she screw well? Don't be shy, tell us, you're amongst familiar faces. Khaustov? Soldier, did you not understand the question? Negative. Repeat it. Private Khaustov. - Here. Don't you get it? How does your wife screw? Private Khaustov! - Here. Is she a gaping hole? - Answer the question. Khaustov, who is your wife? A gaping hole? Stand, soldier! Abort. Look at this head. Private Khaustov, didn't you get the question? Is your wife a gaping hole? Lie down. Abort the command. Who is your wife, Private Khaustov? Lie down. - Abort the command. Remember now, soldier? What's wrong with you, soldier? Lie down. Stand. Lie down. Stand. Lie down. Who is your wife, Khaustov? I didn't tell you to stand, lie down! You remember your wife now? Stand. Lie down. Remember now, soldier? Stand. Lie down. You remember the hole now, kid? Lie down. Stand! Who is your wife? - Lie down. Who is your wife? A gaping hole. Speak louder. - Stand. Lie down. Stand. Lie down. So who is your wife, Khaustov? A gaping hole. Couldn't hear that. Stand. Say it louder. A gaping hole! Iveren, sound lights-out. Lights-out, Iveren. No. What? What did you say? I refuse. My! What did you say? Whom are you shoving? Comrade staff sergeant! As you were! As you were I said! Get out of here! You fucking pup! As you were! Private Mazur. Why aren't you in uniform? - How am I not in uniform? You forget you're in the army? I expect you in 3 minutes. In full uniform. The clock is ticking. Let's get dressed. - You're a pussy. Private Mazur, you're not fully dressed. Stinking sergeant. A division officer here, a morale officer there. "Non-regulatory relations!" "Non-regulatory relations!" What would they do without us? Our hazing is the only thing that holds the army together. A piece of... Now only officers will get to take care of the newbies. What is it, comrade warrant officer? More tea? Bring it over. Right away. (Imitating Brezhnev) When speaking of discipline, one cannot ignore the importance of our army. Comrades, the lads join our military family without any life experience. And they return from the army as proper men. Bastards! Khaustov! - Here! Report here at once. Affirmative. Boris Sergeyevich, look. Cretins. Guards! Weapons! What happened? Weapons! As you were. Double time. Eleventh. - Go eleventh. Twelfth. - Go twelfth. Thirteenth. - Eleventh. Go thirteenth. Five singles. Thirteenth is full. It's full. Get me the third. Prepare the third. Third is ready. - Third is ready. - Let's go. First. Go. Second. Go second. - Fifth. Third. Second. - Faster. Go third. Fourth. Go fourth. - Fifth. Go fifth. - Third. Fourth. Fifth. It's full. - It's full. Close the cell. - Close the cell. Warrant officer handed over his things. Iveren. Report to the warrant officer. He's going to snitch. I have an unyielding wish to leave behind a memory of myself, my work, my conduct. May I? - No problem. There is nothing worse than a meaningless existence. And I... Start reading from here. Read out loud. And I risk dying without having done anything. Without contributing anything to society. Where is the margin between the self and an objective reality? This contradictory ambiguity dwells our in consciousness as the naive concept of freedom. But are we as free as we often imagine ourselves to be? We often forget, or try to forget, what came before us, we prefer to feel... History. History as a cluster of dates and names instead of a means towards a greater awareness of the world. New knowledge leads to new misery. Why did consciousness arise in humans? Stop. Give it to me. Arise is no good. Permeated. That's more precise. We lost our ability to relate. Every attempt to understand the essence of anything brings us to the realization of unknowing. From herein stems the rejection of the rational world. And that's not far from the moment when men land in filth. So I landed there too. The escape from suffering. Is it not those who've done at least one good thing for others, however small, is it not them who make up our world? Quick, take him to the first cell. Cell supervisor, exit. Convict Kharkov, article 226, 5 years. Forward. Enter. Nishchenkin, faster. So? He keeps saying he fell from the bed. What else can he say? Forward. For disobeying the law, Denisenko Iosipov, to exit. Trying to set me up, boss? I didn't snitch! They are setting me up, the pigs, setting me up! I did not snitch. Didn't snitch! To the lockup. You mangy demons! Scabby snakes! I didn't snitch! Wolves! Bastards! I didn't snitch. Shut up or I'll throw you out. Didn't snitch! Didn't snitch! Didn't snitch! Nishchenkin, gauze. If you don't make it, you'll catch up at the next stop. Come on, Aleksey. I should have gone, I'd make it. A policeman is standing there, should have given the letter to him. He'd call and send a telegram. Renat, quickly, open that door. Come on, Zhokhin! Come on, faster, faster. Grab my hand. I sent six, and I called. Met such a nice girl, she did everything instantly. And what's her name? Forgot to ask, I'll go ask her now. Enough, come inside. That was something - Wish I could always run that fast. What are you staring at? The discharge is still far off, kid. Hey you assholes! You green-assed scum! Maple leaves, maple leaves, swept by the wind down the road. Again and again, autumn comes to our city. Rain pushes people under roofs. Wind makes wrinkles in puddles. How many more times will I hear that we are not lovers, just friends. Rain pushes people under roofs. Wind makes wrinkles in puddles. How many more times will I hear that we are not lovers, just friends. You could have guessed that we don't need so much. You could have stopped by, you could have been close to me. You would have smiled, you would have been close to me. You would have been close to me, all evening, all evening long. Thank you. Won't you get sticky? It tastes better this way. Haven't you understood anything? No, I did not. Stand. About face. Khaustov? - Affirmative. Khaustov, give him seconds. Are you deaf, soldier? What don't you understand? Iveren, come out. It's hard to be a sergeant for the Soviet army. Hard indeed. Especially a senior sergeant. He dreams of being discharged first. And you want to walk to your discharge through tall grass? It seems that comrade sergeant forgot how his own service began. Are you the keeper of memories here? Yes, I remember everything. I remember a little sergeant like you. Private Ibragimov, What are you? I am a chink. Who? I am a chink! I am a chink, got it? I am a chink! Don't look at me that way! Thanks to the army, I crawled out of such shit! O departure, departure, I am on the wrong side. No one can separate us, except the soil of mother earth. There a birch, there a mountain ash, there a willow by the river. My dear land, forever loved, there is none other like you. About face. About face. About face. About face. Inmate disembarkment. Where are you? Alexey, I will try to return by morning. Make sure there is order inside, got it? Everything will be fine. That's it. We need to hurry. Khaustov, move it, don't sleep. Khaustov! Khaustov, come on, Khaustov! Turn on the light. Blood is here as well. Don't forget this spot. I don't like this joke, open up. Open up! What's that? What is it? Port wine. Shall we? Keep munching. As you were. What happened? - Nothing, port wine. Two rubles. Just this once. It's our last convoy! A party! We should have a party. That's it, it's all decided. That's it! Excellent! Give me the jar! Money, money, money. It's all good, here's the money, let's get going. Relaxation for the elders. The last convoy. We've dreamt of it for so long. There you are, kid! Why'd you lock yourself in? It's time to be of service. It's the last convoy, understand? Let's go, the bugle is calling. So, are you getting used to this? Main thing is to stay mute, got it? You speak too much, got it? 40 more baths, and you'll be an old dog, a commander of life, got it? And you, got it? You did not get it. That's fine. We've crushed tougher nuts, got it? Come in. It's just me and my friend here. Come in with the friend, we're throwing a party. Well, you've convinced me. And what's your name? Filya. - Nice to meet you, Filya. Nice to meet you too. Welcome, come inside please. What an interesting place. What kind of a wagon is this? - A specialty wagon for the general. And what have you got there? - Generals. Hello boys. I've got a doggy. Madonna. Adina. - With her friend Filya. Happy holidays, boys. And what have you got there? - Wild beasts in cages. And why do look so serious? - He's on duty. So strict? - Very scary. Get out. - What's wrong, man? Who let her in? - It's a lady with a dog. Idiot, she must wear a gas mask. Sure, old man, she'll wear a gas mask, everyone will wear one. Come on, pour. - Don't break it. No, I can't, man. - We've got a lady waiting. I respect you, but I can't. You don't love us, man. - No. Come on, do it for us. Just look at this, come on. - I am not your parent, guys. Fellow conductor. Fellow conductor, when is the next stop? Where do you get off? Thank you. Iveren, come here, Iveren. Come here, dear. - Let's go, let's go. The lady's waiting, the lady's waiting. What's wrong with you? You'll upset the lady. No, no, out of the question, you are coming, let's go. Mischenkin. Kittie. Pardon us. Lance-corporal Kotchenuk has entered the post. It's so cold in here. - Close the door. Soap, manganese and a jar. The clock is ticking. Got it? Zhokhin, make sure they also get something to drink. Where are you going to get some? - I'll find it. - Go ahead then. - Sure. Don't forget the bulb syringe. A jar. I am looking at you, Iveren. You seem all right, but you need to prove yourself, got it, Iveren? Affirmative, staff sergeant. You probably think we humiliate you. That's true. It happened to me too. But you are a soldier in the army. You are not the first or the last. That's correct, staff sergeant. What's correct? - That I am a soldier in the army. Now get lost, soldier. Soldier, if you want... Let's have a drink. - I don't want to. Come on, we are celebrating. - Congratulations, but I won't drink. That's not an answer, just drink. - I will not drink. Drink, I am telling you to drink. - No. Drink. He doesn't want to. It's his loss, more for us. No, wait, he has to drink. Ok, drink. - Drink, I said. - Come on, what's wrong? We order you to drink, so drink. - I am not going to drink. You are going to lick that off. Got it? Do you understand, asshole? You're going to get smart here? Take that, pig. Prick. - Don't bruise his face. What, forgot about your service? Stay down I tell you! Scumbag. I'll make you lick it all off. I'll wipe it with your mug! Keep still, asshole. Lowlife degenerate. Going to give us lip? Take this! Not enough, right? With your mug. You'll lick it all off with your mug. Prick. Didn't want to drink, did he? Bitch! Asshole! Take that, scumbag. Still alive, are you? You can't hear me? Can't hear me? Zhokhin? Zhokhin? You want more? Khaustov, shoot. Shoot, son of a bitch. Shoot, Khaustov. - Hands up or I will shoot. Hands up or I will shoot. Khaustov, shoot! I am shooting! Son of a bitch! The day has passed. Old timers. The day has passed, old timers. Chief, open up. You'll get death penalty now anyway. Boss, please, open up, let us go. What's it to you? I didn't see anything. I swear. I saw nothing. I wasn't here, you understand? Let me out, let me out of here! Are you not feeling well, lad? Are you burnt out? Is everything all right? Later then. Get us a beer.
