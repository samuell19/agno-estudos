The Hardness of Avocado Could you open the trunk, please? I'll send you the audition schedule later. Thank you so much. Take care. You too. The person you've called is not available. Connecting to their mailbox. Did you fall asleep? What a liar! Excuse me. Are you Mizuki Maehara? Uh, yeah... I knew it! I saw that movie you were in. "Her Father... something..." "Her Father, My Lover"? Yeah, that's it! I loved that movie! Really? Would you mind if I shook your hand? Not at all. Thank you so much. I wish you the best with your career! I appreciate it. It means a lot. How awesome was that? I have a fan. Did you set that up? Why would I do that? It was nice and matter-of-fact. You thought it was borning? No, in a good way. Oh? Just normal life. Yeah. I mean, in movies that we should appreciate a normal life, because it's already a miracle, right? I don't really feel that way lately, though. Your life is pretty great, Shimi. More than I do. You've got everything under control. I feel like I'm just wasting my life away. Oh, you're not wasting anything. Think I should get a sofa bed? Hmm? What do you think? I don't know. 27,686 yen. I can do that. Yeah. What're you doing? C'mon, stop. This is nice. Come try it. What're you doing? You going to buy this? I've got a really small living room. Maybe that one's better. Aw, that one's too big. That one's better. They're completely different. Well, go look at some of the other ones. There's no point if you don't know what you want. But if I don't check them out in person I won't know either. And you need me for this? Of course I do! Oh, really. This is fun, right? Oof. Nice, right? If we're gonna live together we'd want a sofa like this. You staying over tonight? Hmm? No. Huh? Why not? Not in the mood. Oh? You've been busy lately? Not really. Then what's wrong? Nothing. I see... Well, then, what do you want to do? Huh? I'm asking what you want to do, Shimi. Let me hear whatever it is you want to do the most. Uh... We can do anything. Then I want to break up with you. What? That's what I want to do. Quit it already with that. I want time to myself. I want to be free. Fine. I'm tired of this. We're over. Morning. Morning. Isn't it pretty early to be playing games? No, I have an audition. How was the movie yesterday? Uh... What? Not so good? All right, I guess. Something wrong? Huh? Where's Shimi? What about her? She isn't staying over? No. Oh? That's unusual. Time to go for it. "Shimi, sorry to contact you while you are at work. But I need to see you. There's so much I need to say to you. I know it's selfish of me, but could we meet up?" Good luck. Good luck. Next, please. Thank you for having me. Please introduce yourself into the camera. I'm Mizuki Maehara from Jungle Talent Agency. I'm 24 years old. I heard it's a geek role, which is why I'm dressed like this. But I forgot the belt. Sorry. And thank you again for the opportunity. We'll take a full-body shot, so please turn around slowly. Thank you. Now from the chest up. Please turn again. Thank you. Have you seen the storyboard? Yeah. Okay, then if you could begin. Got it. And go. Go, go! Whoa! Now, time to summon a dragon! Nice! Just a little more and I win! All right! Nice! What?! Aw, I was so close! Go! Now, right here! Dragon, dragon! Nice! Go! Go! Shimi! Thanks for coming. Yeah. Here. Oh, thank you. It's a souvenir of Nagoya. Ah. What do you feel like? What do you mean? Get drinks? Meat? Fish? Anything's fine. Want to go to Kikuya, then? Okay. I was going to get your favorite flower... what are they called? the Chinese lantern lilies? Lantern lilies. I guess every shop was sold out of them today. Really. I checked about five florists, but none of them had any. You went to five different places? Yeah. You didn't have to go to the trouble. Seems like everyone around here wants to keep us apart. What? Looks like they closed down... How about Tatsumiya? What if they're not open? It'll be fine. All right, I'll check... Aw, my battery's dead. Do you mind? Sure. They're open. All right, let's head there. Sorry. Yeah. Hey, stop... I said stop! What's with you? But... Seriously, quit it. Sorry... I can't stop thinking about you. I've realized that I don't want to end our relationship. I can't. You're freaking me out right now. It's over. I told you I didn't want to have this conversation. That I'm focusing on new things for my life. But we were together just two days ago. And two days have passed... How can we get through this without a breakup? It's not happening. Tell me the parts about me that you don't like, and I'll fix them! That'll be a long list. And I'll fix them all! You won't fix them. And you don't have to. Didn't we have a lot of fun and happy times too? So we can be together. As friends. So you're saying... I can still see you if we're friends? Sure. Just don't think that we're getting back together. What do you mean? If you still have those feelings for me, we can't be friends. But people go from being friends to significant others all the time. Then I'd rather we be strangers. Shimi! That's not possible. We can't be friends or strangers. We've been together for five years! We... we're a "we"! Wait! Hey...! Welcome! Hey, hey. Long time no see! Here he is. Yo! Hey. You're not lookin' too good, Maehara. Just who do you think I am? I'm an actor, man. I guess I forgot. Well don't forget again. Hey Nishi, come listen to this. Sure. Okay, here we go. "It'll be really..." Would you like to order? I'll have a beer. And I'll take this out of your way. All right. Here we go. "It'll be really hard, but I can persevere. And if I do, maybe we can be together again. I've got to believe that." You don't have to read it out. That's scary. My tweet from hell. Wow, it sounds like it. What do you think? Is it laughable? I don't think you should post stuff like that. Probably. Not for the world to see. It's too late. Why'd she leave you, anyway? It was getting too dull, I guess? I wish I could have the luxury of saying that. Shut it, you virgin! Who're you callin' a virgin?! What're you trying to say? Anyway, I won't be a virgin for long. How'd that happen? A girl's coming over to my house to watch Star Wars together. Oh, that's right. Did you hear about this, Maehara? It's news to me. I was out in Ikebukuro with some comedian friends, and I kinda picked up this girl named Eri. Eri? Eri is a fine name, don't you think? He was with friends in Ikebukuro, and got this Eri girl interested in him on his first try flirting with her. On his first try, eh? Wow! She must be a real slut. Don't call her a slut! Eri has to be a false name, right? That's fake. That's her real name. Has to be. Really? It is. And she's a great girl. The kind of girl who will sleep with anyone. That's not true. Don't say that! So, Nishigami's been going on regular dates with this Eri girl. And he's been wearing Star Wars t-shirts a lot lately, right? Eri sees that and goes "I've never seen Star Wars!" and that sets it up for them to watch it at his place. Yep. Isn't that awesome? Well, can we focus the conversation on me now? That's right. I mean, this is supposed to be about me getting over being dumped, after all. Right, right. Sorry. So, I think about a month will do it. Is that how long you're gonna wait for Shimi? Yeah. I think that's about right. Oh, really? Sounds about average, doesn't it? I was thinking that after a month without me, she'd get lonely too. What do you think, Kusakabe? I have no idea. Looks like he doesn't know. So, let's think about this situation as if it were Eri and myself. What? That doesn't sound like it has the same importance. It's just as important! And that's a fake name. It's not. Can you seriously stop with that? It is! But I love her. It's love. Is she even a real person? Look, let's say Eri and you dated for 5 years. And she dumps you. How would you respond to a "happy birthday" mail a month later? We're supposed to be talking about Shimi! Forget Eri for a second. Okay, I'm sorry. But let's at least hear his take on things. His take? Nishi's virginal take? He might have a killer idea! Well, uh... "I love you." How's that? Come on, that works, right? I like it. Nope! Nope?! He denied it. But it was fine! No, it just didn't have the right ring to me. Well, that might be your opinion. You're not texting her that? Nope. Really? Not happening. It's direct. I don't think it's bad. Eri would be touched by that? Yes she would if it comes from your heart. Does Eri even exist? Of course she does! I have my doubts... No way to doubt! Because no girl would follow a virgin boy like you. But Eri did! And if she did... that's funny. Such a weak punchline. And she must be crazy. That's not true. Such a gloomy mood. All of a sudden. All right, time to sing! You're nuts! No I'm not! "I'm out of breath and holding my chest." "You laugh and say 'Long time no see.' " "You say I'm an idiot and didn't need to rush over like that." "That I'm covered in a thin layer of sweat." "I don't know why, but I realized that I need you today." "Looks like you've seen another woman." "Get rid of the layer of shade that covers you." "Your lips have changed colors." "Spread your unseen wings. " "You've definitely changed." -Is this song about having a broken heart? I don't know. A guy who sees a girl for the first time in a while, she looks even prettier than before. That's it. Oh god, this is nuts. "You've changed." Shimi! Why'd you have to go and change on me?! I want to be with you forever! Please stay the way you are! "Happy 20th birthday. Like how yeast helps bread rise, I want to be there to lift you up. Always." But man, I'm worried. It'll be fine. He looks a little scary, but he's a good person. Really? Stay here. You know I can't do that. He'd get mad at me. It'd be fine, man. -No way! Is he interviewing too? Maybe. Hey. Did you bring your resume? Thank you. Thank you. Excuse me. Pardon me. So, Shinozaki, you a friend of Takeda? That's right. Meiji university? -Yes. There are only students from Meiji University. You can only work twice a week? -Yeah. I have a bunch of classes the other days. What shift do you want to work? The night shift. Can you work weekends? I have clubs so that would be difficult. I see. We need people who can work weekends. So we could use the help. Okay. Maehara, you've got time on your hands? I'm an actor. Really? So you're on TV and stuff? I mean, I haven't been on TV too much yet. What? I belong to a talent agency. How many times a week can you work? As an actor, my schedule changes a lot. But I think I can work three or four times a week. What shift? The night shift would probably overlap with my work as an actor. But I could work afternoons. And mornings would be fine. You have a driver's license? Yeah. I do. Can you do delivery? I'd actually prefer to work in-store if possible. I don't need someone in-store working four days a week. Well, I don't have confidence in my driving abilities... Hmm. I see. Well, you're both hired. Fill this out and bring it back the next time you come in. Don't you dare look away. You just look at me. Okay. Okay, cut! Man, everyone's laughing. Was it really okay? Yeah, of course! It's great! -Really? Yeah. but there is one thing. Can you leave a little space between the lines? About two seconds or so. -Sure. Got it. Okay, then let's roll again! -Let's do it. Is her jaw angle right? -Oh, right. Maehara, don't forget. The angle of her jaw. Is this about right? Ah, yeah. A little higher. Oh, that's too far up. A little lower. Right there. Okay, then let's go. Let's run through this again! I feel like I'm gonna burst out laughing. No! We've got to be super serious. Let's do this. I'll take this. Could you bring a lunch box to Mr. Maehara too? Alright. Can I get one more box? Hey! -Oh, hello! Hello. Please have this. Thank you so much. Also this one. -Oh, thanks. Thank you so much. May I sit here? Sure, please. We're lucky it didn't rain. Yes, it somehow held up. We're really lucky. Wanna eat it? Um? I'm not a big fan of these. Really? Then, yes. Oh, ok. Thanks a lot. I'm taking one. Please. Thank you. And now I have three fried shrimps. -Morning. -Morning. What're you making? -A salad. I see. Hey, could you get me an avocado? Yeah, sure. Just one? -Yeah. You think this is too hard? -Huh? You think? Hmm? Don't you know this stuff? -What? Huh? Shimi. Shimi. Shimi. Shimi. Shimi. Ah, there you are Shimi. This isn't ripe enough yet, right? Yeah, it needs some time. I'll just put it back, then. Hey, what happened to getting me an avocado? Sorry. It's not ripe enough yet. Then what'll we do? Want to make fried rice? Yeah. That sounds good. There's some rice left. -I see. Let's make fried rice with it. -Okay. What's wrong? Nothing? You're acting weird. Want some of this? Okay. There you go. I went to Yokohama today, to visit this girl I'm into. I'm going to forget all about you, Shimi. Okay? That's super creepy. That's like one step away from you becoming a criminal. You talk to that thing everyday? Yeah. Since when? I always have. Creepy. I put it there when I started dating Shimi. Huh? What do you mean? When we'd come here, I'd open the closet and she'd be over there behing me. I'd act like I was praying to the picture. Like, "I'm home!" She'd laugh so much at that. What's with the accent? She loved it when I used to do this. You used to laugh a lot, right, Shimi? I swear, this is creepy. Really creepy. Shimi... She's not here anymore. She's not here, man. What's the score, between Shimi and Sasaki? Hmm. I think it's 6-4 right now. Which one's at 6? Sasaki is. -Wait, Sasaki is?! Reverse. -What's with that face? Then what's Shimizu at 4 for? I don't know. I call green. Just say it. What're things like with her? Well, I think she likes me. Oh? Why's that? Well, I sent her a friend request on Facebook. She accepted it that very second. Yeah, that's a start. That means she was on my page right then. That both of us were just about to push that button. Oh, I get it. So you think you pushed it like a second earlier? Yeah! She was gonna push it too. Hell, we might've done it at the exact same time. That's true. I mean, it was the same second. Though, it'd all be for nothing if she had a boyfriend. You haven't asked her? Reverse. Reality might be bitter, but at least your coffee is sweet. Maehara. -Yes? Can you try a take where you sound more gloomy? Right. More gloomy. -Okay. Got it. -Let's try again. Reality... reality might be bitter. Reality might be bitter. How's that? Good. Try it like that. -Ah, okay. Let's try again. All right, let's do it again! Reality might be bitter, but your coffee is sweet. Oh, you left out the "at least" there. Sorry. Really? Yeah. -Sorry about that. I left that out? Yeah. It's okay. Let's just do it again. But I did the gloominess right? Just a little gloomier. -Right, more gloomy. -Got it. -Gloomy. Okay, let's do it again. So, Ms, Sasaki, where do you live? Ah, I live in Wako City. Huh? Wako City? Yeah. Um... in Saitama? Right. I see. Are you going to be able to make your last train? I'm probably gonna have to go back to the office after this. Really? That sounds rough. It's fine. So, what is it you like to do in your free time? I just sort of lounge around my house. I've been watching a bunch of foreign romance shows lately. I get that. I watch those too. For real? My girlfriend broke up with me recently. Oh, really? We dated for about five years. That's pretty long. Why'd she leave you? She said she "wants time to herself." So she wanted some space? So I decided to give her about a month to herself before I go on the attack again. That's not a bad idea, I guess. But even if we got back together now I feel like she'd just break up with me again. In which case there was no meaning to breaking up the first time. Is there a meaning to breaking up? To separate for a bit, and for both of us to grow. Something like that. Huh. So I think it might be a good idea to date another girl to have that kind of experience. You mean to date a new girl, while still thinking about your ex? It would be to forget her. Could you even do that? No, I guess not. Ah, sorry about that. I didn't mean to ask you all this personal stuff. It's fine. Now we're getting into a deep conversation. Have you had any experiences like that? -Huh? I mean like getting back together with an ex. Not really. I don't understand relationships and stuff so well. I see. I mean, we talk about breaking up sometimes. But then we just stay in our relationship. You have this talk with your boyfriend? -Yeah. My current boyfriend. Okay. I mean, he never does what he says. I tell him to put stuff away, and he still makes a mess. That happens a lot. Right. I guess all couples go through that. I don't know about that. But I guess everyone has built up discontent. Yeah, that's true. Like what, specifically? Like he'll send me a message saying what time he'll be home that night. But then he'll come home way later. I mean, with the job that I do, I'm not in a position to criticize him on that. No, that's not true. For you it's your job. That's the kind of stuff that we go through. I'm happy to lend an ear to your relationship troubles. Sorry about that. But thanks for listening. I'm on your side. That's pretty reassuring. I mean, I actually like you. Oh, thank you! No, I mean it. Like, I really like you. Why don't you get in contact with her? Hmm? You're gonna contact her eventually, right? What are you talking about? -Your ex. Why not contact her? I feel like this is the right timing for it. You mean right now? Yeah, right now. Get out your phone. No. I can't call her. Oh? Why not? I just... don't want to. But you've been waiting for a month, haven't you? Yeah. I don't know what's been going on with you. But why would you say you like me so soon, even though you've been waiting for a month for her? I've only known you a week. Now give her a call. You're still in love with your ex, right? Yeah. Then you should be able to call her. Why can't you? She didn't answer. How do you fall for someone that easily? Are you making fun of me? This definitely went differently than I thought it would. With you, and the filming. What the hell? Seriously. Good night, everybody. Oh, hello. Nice to meet you. I'm Rin. -Hey. Do you mind if I leave my things here? -Go for it. Thanks. You seem like a kind guy. -Aw, nah. It's gotten awfully cold lately, don't you think? -Yeah, it has. You haven't gotten sick lately, have you? Actually, I had a fever recently. Oh, sorry to hear that. -Yeah. I mean, it went away. That's good to hear. Do you get fevers often? Not really. This is the first I've had in a while. Is that so? Can I sit next to you? -Sure. Excuse me. You're pretty young, aren't you? No, not really. Mind if I ask how old you are? I'm 24, but I'm turning 25 soon. See? You are young. We're not that far apart. Our ages are really far apart. No way. Really? Yes. I mean, when you first came in, I thought... She's kind of young. Is that so? -Yeah. How old do you think I look? Hmm. About thirty... five, or so? -Hmm? 35? Not bad. I'll take that. Does this feel good? Yeah, it feels really good. I'm glad. You definitely got good at this, dating that girl for five years. Want to go to the bed? Take my bra off. Okay. Hmm? What's the matter? You like your nipples played with? Okay, I'll lick them for you then. You've got chest hair. She's cute! -Yeah, she is. How old is she? Same age as me. Oh really. Why'd she leave you? I guess... She took the fact that I was there for granted. Well, you know what's good for that? Going on a trip. I haven't been able to travel much lately. Oh, really? -Yeah. Take her to a nice hotel in Shinjuku, even. That'd mean a lot. Hmm. If we get back together, maybe I will. You should. Okay. I've gotten back together with an ex before. Oh, really? He's my husband now. How did it happen? He was living in Yokohama. I lived in Saitama. After we broke up, he came to my place for the first time. He said we should get back together. And I just... forgave him. That's encouraging. You want to go another round? No, I'm fine. You're an earnest guy. I'm sure it'll be fine. Thanks. Huh? Is that you, Maehara? -Oh, hello. How are you doing? Um, is Midori home? No, she isn't. That's fine. Sorry to bother you. -Come inside. No, no. I'm fine. -Eh, what's the matter? I'll come by another time. Sorry to bother you. What're you doing for meals? Huh? Are you two cooking together? Yeah. I mean, Midori's so good at cooking, and she's teaching me. Really? -Yeah. She's not causing any trouble for your sister, I hope? No, not at all. Your room must be really messy, isn't it? Thanks. You know Coppice Kichijoji on Sun Road? Yeah. There's a new tea shop there. Is that so? -Yeah. Thank you. Oh, wow. This is really good. Really? Oh, I'm glad. This must be the best tea I've ever had. Thank you. This is uva tea from Sri Lanka. I've got this delicious chamomile you should try next time. Sure. Did you guys get into a fight? Huh? You were together last night, right? Ah, yeah... We had a fight last night. Oh, that Midori... No, that's not it. She's so stubborn, isn't she? Has she been doing okay, lately? Hmm? Um... I'm sorry about this but could you keep the fact that I came here today a secret from her? Why? We broke up. With who? With Midori? -Yes. Oh, I see. You guys broke up. But why? I mean... I don't know. I see. Hmm... Okay. I'm going to head out now. Hey, wait a minute. This is that chamomile tea. Take some with you. Thank you. You should probably have something to put that in. No, it's fine. Here. -Thank you. That's a little big, isn't it? No, it's fine. I have my bag with me. -Just a moment. This one's good, don't you think? -Thank you. It's a little crumpled up. -It's fine. Thank you very much. I'll be sure to drink the tea. All right, my place is this way, so... Are you going to be on stage or anything soon? Oh, yeah. In January. That's great. It's no big deal. I'll be sure to get a ticket. Thank you so much. Okay, bye. See you later. Hello. Excuse me. -Yes? Why do you have so many Chinese lantern lillies? What? I asked why you have so many Chinese lantern lillies. Did you want to purchase some? No, not really. Just wanted to know why. Well, I mean... we did just get a bunch in today. The last time I came here, you guys didn't have any. Why do you have so many today? Sorry about that. My apologies. -No, no. I just want to know why. -Well...? Could you stop with the apologies? I just need to know why. Yes. I mean... We can only get them during certain seasons. Why is that? Well, it's a living creature, so... I'm a living creature too. Seriously? That's like 0.02 milimeters thick! Enough about it already! Did it feel good? Yeah, of course. That makes sense. It was your first time, after all. It was awesome! And where does Eri live again? Ikebukuro? No, she lives in Tabata. -Then let's tell everyone toward Tabata! Toward Tabata? -Yeah. But I don't know the direction of Tabata. It's gotta be somewhere. -Where? I don't know. It's over here. Man, say so earlier. So this way, right? Why do you know your way around Tabata? Intuition. You gotta say something, man. Okay, then... Eri! It was so awesome! What the heck was that? I'm just kidding. Huh? I'm just teasing you. That's not just teasing. You're a comedian, but you can't take a joke? You're not gonna do well in the business. Huh? -Yeah? And just how old are you? I turned 25 today. Ah, happy birthday! -Thanks. Can't be good for that age actor to be hurting for work. I get more work than you do. This isn't when you try to make yourself look good. Man, this guy doesn't have a sense of humor. You're the one making a bunch of "jokes" that aren't funny. He really has no sense of humor, does he? You're going a little far. -Huh? Let's stop this already. What's with this, guys? This is on you. -Man, this is lame. You're the one who has the worst sense of humor, y'know! No. It was a joke! It isn't funny if you say it was a joke yourself. Fine. I'm going home. Wait, Maehara. Don't you dare run away. What's he saying? I don't get this guy. Say that to my face! -Huh? Fight me! The hell are you doing? Don't act tough. I'll kill you, man! Where you going?! Welcome back. Why'd you start eating without me? Because you're late. -Hmph. What's with those? I bought them. That's so sad. I mean, I am alone. What do you mean alone? No one understands how I feel. You don't know what it means to truly be alone. You have family and friends. What's with you? If I say I'm alone, why don't you just leave it at that?! Don't underestimate what true loneliness is. I'm not. I'm just tired. Seriously, don't say that again. People who are really alone turn into murderers. So if I killed Shimi, I'd be truly alone? Man, you're gross today. It's over between you. It's my birthday today, you know! Midori Shimizu: It's been a while. I turned 25 yesterday. Are you doing well? It's hard for me to go on without you, but I'm doing my best. No need for you to reply to this. Mr. Futami, buy me something to drink! Hmm? No way. -Aw, come on! Please? Oh, fine. -Yay! What do you want? I'll have a gin and tonic. -A gin and tonic. Who's this cute girl? Yuri. You've got nice eyes. Who's this guy? Uh... what's your name again? Oh, come on! I'm Maehara. -Ah, that's right. Maehara. Good evening. -Same to you. You can read palms? -Yeah. Oh, wow. Then read mine. -Sure. Awesome. This one. -Okay. What do you want me to read? Okay, start with my love life. You're going to get married at 32. How do you know? See, this is your marriage line. -Okay. And you've got a thick line here, see? This thing? -Yeah. 32? That'll be 2024 already. The Heisei era will be over already! -Whoa. Want to guess what the new era name will be? That sounds fun. Just two kanji, right? Shimizu. -Eh? What's Shimizu? A name. Whose name? My ex. Hmm. Can I touch your hair? Sure. It's so fluffy. Do you have a perm? No. It's naturally curly. Can I touch it? Go ahead. -Yay. It's so silky. Can I give you a kiss? Eh? No way. Ow. It's a grey hair. You can keep it. Thanks. Your thumb. You know how there're those dating apps lately? Made a profile on one. Who did? -I did. Oh, man. What? I get to see a bunch of guys' faces, and I sort them into likes and dislikes. And you get sorted that way too, don't you? Yeah, but I'm shy about it so I made my profile picture ice cream. And whenever I push "like" on someone, I always get a match. I guess everyone really likes ice cream. -Hmm. What's with that "hmm"? What kind of hmm is that? Nope. Just understanding what's going on. So, after you get a match, what happens? They send you a message. -Wow. But these guys are all seriously thirsty. What do they say? Or are they all just wanting to sleep with you? I mean, that could be it, but... -Seriously, watch out for that. Hmm. You should join it yourself. I mean, I'm an actor. You don't have to put a picture up. I can't. Want me to do it for you? Make a "Mizuki" profile? No, I'm good. -What's good about you? I don't want to do it. Why? You're all grumbly. You should do it. What're you doing for Christmas? You got a phone call. Hello. Yeah. Hmm? Hello? Eh? What's wrong? I'm at home. Yeah. What, are you crying? You are crying. It was Shimi. What? She wants to meet. Wow. I'm taking off now. You're going right now? -Yeah. Sorry about the meal. -Wow. Good luck! Sorry! Don't worry about it. Did you have to wait? -No. I just got here. -Oh, good. You just get off work? -Yeah. You must be tired. Thanks. Where should we go? What do you feel like? I want a drink. -Nice. Let's go. I finally told my mom that we broke up. Oh, really? You want another drink? -No, I'm good. Did she say anything? She was really surprised. Well, it is a surprising thing. She was like "I don't see any reason for you to have broken up with a kind man like Mizuki." There you go! You're getting more food? -Yeah. Why? You okay? -Yeah. My tooth hurts a little, but I'm hungry. I want dessert. I bet it does. Yeah, but I want some dessert. They have homemade sherbert or fried taiyaki. You know, I'm still ready to get back together. You sure are something. I mean it. That's just how I feel. You've been waiting this whole month? -Yeah. Is it still warm? -It's cool. Are you cold? No, I'm fine. Let's go back to my place. It's warmer there. And what're we going to do there? Go back, go to sleep together, wake up, and go to work. I guess, but that doesn't mean we're getting back together. Forget it, then. I can't bring you home then. That's why I don't want to go. Fine. Wait a sec. -Whoa. Now I'm cold. What're you doing? Warming you up. Okay. I'm gonna read your future. You can do that? -Yeah. What do you want to know? How long will I live to be? -Okay. I can't see because it's so dark. Ah, there we go. You'll live to be 98. That's a pretty long life. -Yeah. What will my luck with work be like? I see. -Huh? It'll be fine as long as you don't expect too much. Huh? Anything else? Uh... Okay, how about your luck with love? Your marriage line. You're going to get married at 32. 32? That's pretty far away. Not at all. It's right around the corner. And let's just make this line a bit thicker... That hurts. You're being weird. Hey. Why are we over? We're both 25. Don't you want a more passionate, loving relationship? Oh come on. Are you serious? Who knows. I think I should probably go home. Ah, yeah. Thanks for today. -No problem. Call me anytime. I will. Shimi, I like the way you talk. I like your clothes. I like your eyes. I like the way you smile. I like everything about you. I love you. Thank you. I'm glad. Good. Nice seeing you. -Later. I'm like a solitary dot And if you trace around my edge It makes my boundaries thick Even though there's no reason for it If your kindness is about to fall Get out of our gazes at one-another But inside the mesh of our sensibilities. We wave as we pass someone on the street We count the faces of children Walking shoulder to shoulder The underline sinks down It seems beyond saying, but There's no way I'll trip and fall Before my sadness ripens Get rid of the standards by which we measure Inside the web of our emotions I wave at the person leaving If your kindness is about to fall Your voice hurts me, so please stop You're protected in the mesh of our sensibilities And I embrance you as you lean ©︎JOMasaya
