-What happened? -Grandma! Dad hit me. Ok, dont cry. What you did? Grandma! Tell me a story. -What story? -Story of the prince, who stole the knife. I have told it countless times. -Tell me once more, Grandma! -Ok, come on. Sit here. Long ago, There was a princess in our race. Her name was also Mehandi! A Peacock-pretty Princess was once lived in the Tropical nation. Prince of the Hill nation was fallen by her striking beauty. While they were waiting in their love chariot... The seeds spread in the air and blue flowers bloomed. Then the Mangolian King invaded and defeated the Hill nation. The Prince fled into the forest. The Mangolian King... Conquered the Tropical nation And killed their King. In the presence of the captured princess... An astrologer whispered about a secret into the Mangolian King’s ear. Take the knives made up of Rhino’s bone... Hurl it around the princess for 30 days! Collect some blood by slashing your chest and offer it to the God! If you do this, you will be immortal...! When it reaches the Prince’s ears, he sneaked into the fort by the night... He fetched the Princess and the knife And vanished into thin air… He entered into the forest… Lived happily in the love universe…! Editing Philomein Raj Cinematography Selvakumar S.K.

Who gives a damn about it? Hey! Things I hear about you are not pleasant! You should stop all these. Who will respect me, if things go wrong in my family? Why should one live after loosing the community pride? -It's not like that-- -Hey, shut up! Dont talk! Listen! I won't mind to kill you even you are my only son! Behave properly! Nonsense... Look here! Your father is slapping me often... I couldn't control my anger-- Drive me to a wineshop! You are looking handsome. You are from a rich and respectable family. But... Mehandi's father will not accept your love. -Why? -Our people always behave like this. I like you. I will help you. -I'm helping for you. -Super! It's enough for me. What will be your family's response? Response? He will get fury even someone falls in love, will he just leave his son. He is always being proud about his community, pride and other rubbish. He won't understand all these especilly about love. My mother was knitting a load of ducks in clothes, for the past 25 years... She knit them cutely, you know? She knitted more than 1000 ducks, till. My father never gave a damn about it. What the *** damn he will do about my love? Nothing! If I get married with Mehandi... ...no one can do anything. I will take care of it. Don't you understand, onething? If you follow your father's words... ...you will be his hand puppet. But if you marry Mehandi, against your father's wish, -You will have to be a clown in circus. -Stop! This is too much... After the arrival of this circus... Changed your two wheeler as a public carrier, Dude. Hereafter Jadav will sit behind. No place for you! -Bye, Jadav! -See you! Disassemble the tent in the morning. (Indistinct voices...) Oh! Desireful heart...! Oh! Desireful heart...! Did you believe the dreams are real? Oh! My heart...! Listen Mehandi! You know that your father will not accept your love. These guys always befriends us for just pleasure! When it comes to marriage, they will vanish in thin air. Spending time with our girls is an entertainment for them. Several of our girls being cheated in the name of love. How could you do this though you are aware of it? Hereafter he will not come for you. I have faith on him. Did you believe the dreams are real? Oh! My heart...! Oh! Desireful heart...! Oh! Desireful heart...! Your dream will... come true! Oh, My dear! "Mehandi circus starts today evening in your town..." "Daily two shows..." Oh! Desireful heart...! Oh! Desireful heart...! Oh! Desireful heart...! (Indistinct voices...) I want to marry Mehandi! I will take care of her. You won't get any problem. No one can do any harm. I will take care of it. Are you bother of losing income due to Mehandi's absence? How much money you want? I will pay whatever you need! What you said? Are you paying me? -Get out! -I didn't mean-- -Get out! -It's not-- -Get lost! -I didn't mean that way. I don't need you and your money. We moved from there to keep our esteem. Now you came here and offering me money? -Get lost! -I didn't mean it, sorry if I'm wrong. I'm here, for Mehandi! I can't live without her. She will be happy only with me! Our love is true! True love? You both met just a month ago! Sir! Leave us. Please leave us. Otherwise, I will get heart attack. Move away sir. -Who wants his money? -Shall we dissassemble the tent? No, Dont! Wherever we go, this guy will come. (Indistinct voices...) Jadav! Yes sir! -Call that guy! -Okay. (Indistinct voices...) Whatever you said is right. You sincerely love my daughter. But, you shouldn't say about paying money. I don't need it.. You do one thing! If you do it properly, you can take Mehandi with you. You can go wherever you wish, I don't bother. But, you have to do one thing! Just hurl... 9 knives around her... as you seen in the Death game! If you hurl those 9 knives perfectly... ...then you can take her. If you fail, never come near us. That's it. You can leave. I keep my words, see you later. Jeeva, the whole world is a circus! There is a knife hanging on everyone's head. Power, money, honor... ...community, religion, family... ...Lust, hostility, treachery... ...Jealous, beauty, ugly are those knives dwelling around us. For your father, it's community! For your mother, it's duck! For me, it's Jesus! For you, it's Mehandi and Love! As I said, there is a knife hanging on everyone's head. Wine, song, dance, cinema, circus and everything lies in between this. Then, that ladies wrist watch in my place... ...It's also in between the knife. Jeeva! Jesus has made galons of wine from just a bunch of grapes! He served a single piece of fish into hundred pieces! He resuscitated a dead man! You can't understand these easily. But if you look deep into it... Nothing is impossible if we determine. When it comes for love, everything is possible. Just try! Try in the name of Jesus! So, Jadav has agreed to train you. Your love itself is a violence. -Now you are into knife throw too. -Hey, shut up. First, you have to learn, how to hold the knife. Then learn, how to hurl it. Later, you can learn to aim and hurl. -Try on this side. -This side? Wow! -You nailed it, dude! -Hey, leave me. I mean it dude. It's really great to miss every throw as much as hitting the target every time. -Don't worry, it will take some time. -He says, you will not make it. listen, he has planned that you should not marry his daughter even in dream. -See now, I will hurl it properly. -Hey, we can't do it dude. Your posture seems better than a professional. -That's it. -Yes! Look, what I have done! Try once more. Yes! If you want to hit the knives on the right spot next to legs, hands, hip and neck... ...you should train hard. You should always think about the knife! Hey dude, to what extent can you help me? -Why you ask like this? I will even spare my life. -Then go and stand near that door. -Near this door? -Yes, dude. Close the door and stand. Pose as an angel. Hey, I asked to stand like an angel! (Murmuring...) That's it. Hey! I didn't mean to spare, my life. Now you want to play with a live target, right? I will arrange for it. Can you buy a biriyani? -Want to have biriyani? -Not for biriyani, it's for love. That love has made one as begger. Now going to make one, as murderer. Have some biriyani... No! If you stand there, you will get biriyani. Raise your hands, close your eyes and pray. Now stand still. You carry on dude. Oh God! Hey, run! Run for life! Hey, dont risk your life for some biriyani. Enough? Wow, dude! Super, dude! 4 out of 9 hit the target. But any one of the remaining 5 knives hits her, then... Hey, mind your job! I know what to do. -Hey, you throw it! -Don't irritate me, get lost! Jadav, today 5 knives hit the target. What happened, Jadav? We are leaving next week. Where? Leaving to Andhra. (Indistinct chatter...) I'm ready! Knife! Are you kidding me? It will take... atleast 5 years to master in knife throw. It's too early. It's not as easy as love... ...to become master in 30 days. You can go. -Just leave sir. -Jeeva! (Murmuring words...) Come on, you can do it! Go to your position. -Hey, bring the board! -Okay master. Now... Blood-curdling... Death Game! Starts in... few seconds. If he misses, she dies. Here, for your excitement... ...we are risking a life. It starts now... I coudn't do it. I don't. You can keep your daughter! Take care of her, right? I'm leaving. -Do you want Roti & Dhal? -It's Okay. -Lets order Roti & Dhal for all. -What do you want sir? -Hot poori with sabzi! What do you want? Nothing. -Kunal, come fast. -Coming. (Indistinct voices...) Why are you doing this? Will drinking alcohol, change everything? Wherever I go, I am haunted by a guilt. It's all because of me. Let's go. Hi Jadav! Is it you? Thank god! I thought it was someone. Don't be afraid, Jadav is on our side. He only gave knife training. Jadav, Father has left Poompaarai and waiting near a lodge at Chinnaalapatti. Once things got settled, we will come back. -Shall we go? -I'm glad about you. -Be happy. -Okay Jadav, we are leaving. Don't be afraid. No worries. Her father asked to throw knife to marry. His father will throw knife if he marries. Leave them behind. Your decision is right. You are an unknown from somewhere... But the Lord has signed a deed that you have to spend your life with him. Your love should remain true always, that's enough. Keep this. It contains the address. Go to Clover. From there, you can reach uphill safely. I have informed over phone. My girl friend will take care of you. Don't mention me there as Amaladoss. For her, I am Candy! Father, why she named you as Candy? Ok, the sermon is over. You can leave. Keep this. -Have these biscuits and fruits when you feel appetite. -Ok. They won't let me in peace after you gone missing. I'm going to Trichy. You will be safe, Father! You will hide in the Church! -Nobody will suspect you. -That's the Lord's blessing, my son! God bless you by child. Live happily. -See you Father. See you dude. -Take care. Ok. "The kin that found me..." "The kin that found me..." "My future is with you, my dear...!" "My future is with you, my dear...!" "Oh, my dear kin...! "Oh, my dear heart...!" -You wear this. -No. Just wear this. What happened? -Are you worried?. -No Then what? Are you scared? -No. -What else? Nothing else... except you! "The kin that found me..." "The kin that found me..." "The kin that found me..." Who are you? Father sent us here. He has given a letter too. Candy told me. This has become a routine for him. This is how, he is blessing everyone. Ok, please get in. Come on. -Thank you! -Ok. Be seated. Sit. -Did you eat? Shall I prepare dosas? -No, thanks. We ate. -Ok, atleast have some black tea. -Ok. Did any one notice while you came here? No. Hey! What happened? Have this. Will decide things after 2-3 days. Don't worry about anything. -Ok? -Ok. Hey! Let's go out and talk. Honey! What happened? Whenever you come near me... ...you always hug and kiss. But you don't prefer to speak. Am I only for this? If we have sex... -...then you will get bored of me, right? -Nonsense! A month ago, I dont even know you exist. Now, you are everything to me. Now only I'm worried. I wonder what made you to care so much about me, in just a month. What about you? You came with me just after a month me met. No! I knew you... since our last birth. My grandma used to tell a story. Story of the prince, stolen the knife. In that story, I was... the Princess! You were... the Prince! You were the one who protected and took care of me... in our last birth. Even in this birth too... ...I will take care of you. Listen! Your skin may wrinkle, tooth may fall and you may get too old... ...even then I will cuddle you, kiss you and take care of you! -Are you sure? -It's a promise! You are everything to me. Don't worry, I'm with you. Okay? You have plenty of time. Please go inside. Brother, your vehicle is parked infront of the house. -If anyone see, it may lead to problems. Please park backside. -Ok. Dear son! Mom is waiting for you at home. What are you doing here? Jeeva! -Jeeva! -Hey! Get her! (Chaotic voices...) No! We will take your son. Kill her! Leave her. Drag her out! Leave me! Who the hell you are? Get up! Leave her! Lift him and throw away... Damn your Love. Bloody love! Hey! Whatever you do, you should keep our community pride. Senseless guy! Hey! Get him to the vehicle. An addressless girl, wants my son? A showgirl like you, want to marry my son? You, Runaway dog! Start the vehicle... (Indistinct voices...) You should lay low, while you are here for survival. Your daughter has gone overboard. Do onething. Move your circus to Tarapuram. It's my friend's limit. I will take care of it. Got it? Just follow my instrucion. No Sir! We are going back to our native. This is enough. Please spare us. We will not come back here again. Poor girl! Everything will be okay master... Aunt is calling. Tell me aunty. She wants to speak with you. Tell me aunty. Call me after 15 minutes, if situation worsens... ...I will speak with the doctor. Okay. She suffers during night. Mom couldn't sleep properly. Her body gets chill and suffers to breathe. Now she misses me too... I'm scared... 'I was seaching for Mehandi in every city and circus...' 'I couldn't find her' 'My paths are closed suddenly...' 'I forced myself in solitary...' 'I hope that I will find her one day...' "Love is treacherous...! It does kill slowly...!" "It has no eye...! It flows nonstop like tears...!" "Why this is happening...? Tell me now... oh my girl!" "Why this is happening...? Tell me now... oh my girl!" Hey! Why do you brought this low class boy into the home? You lost your senses? Mom, food ready? One more son is here! "Like a dry leaf in the water..." "My love is in the drifting state!" "Fish like eyes, throwing dragnet..." "Tell me darling, whose fault was it?" "Tinkling anklets, when goes away..." -"Won’t my every atom scream?" -Shall I arrange for your marriage? "When you neglect, my life gets spoiled! Come to save me darling...!" "Love is treacherous...! It does kill slowly...!" "It has no eye...! It flows nonstop like tears...!" "Why this is happening...? Tell me now... oh my girl!" "Love is treacherous...! It does kill slowly...!" "Why this is happening...? Tell me now... oh my girl!" (Groaning sound...) Sir! You will be alright sir... Is anyone there? Don't worry sir! You will be alright... Is any one out there? (Groaning sound...) Don't worry sir! We will go to hospital. 'Life taught me... how true are Father's words' 'Jeeva, the whole world is a circus!' 'There is a knife hanging on everyone's head' 'For your father, its community!' 'For your mother, it's duck!' For me, it's Jesus! -Please hold on! -Brother, you shouldn't do like this! Please father, its important. I will be back in a minute. (Indistinct voices...) Brother, what are you doing? Please don't stop him. Let him tie it. Will you come with me, wherever I go? I will follow wherever you go. I will fnd you! "Oh! Sunny Rain…!" "Oh! My lightening flower... Where did you... go?" "You are the silent speech...!" "Please speak to me...!" "My journey goes in search of your words...!" "Clouds are covering now…!" "Time is passing by...!" "My path keeps extending…" "Oh! Sunny Rain…!" "Oh! My lightening flower... Where did you... go?" "Oh! Sunny Rain…!" "Oh! My lightening flower... Where did you... go?" You will find her! Surely you will find her! "I run across thousands of faces everyday...!" "Where can I find your face?" "I’m flying all over the land..." "Will I unite with you?" "My dear chillness! Oh, golden blaze! You are the twilight!" "My only dream! Oh, revolving nostalgia! It's you alone!" "The music came near me, has gone far away!" "My soul is draining by searching that direction!" Solapur is the next town. There is a circus running. -What do you want? -Have to go inside. -Whom do you want to meet? -You should not go inside. -Leave me. Can't you listen my words? Don't run. Stop! Catch him! Leave him! Leave him! Leave him please! Leave him now! -Ramji! -Sir! You... are you Mr. Jeeva? Yes... I didn't expect to meet you in this circus... -Tell me, how is Mehandi? -We can speak about it later, brother. After we left your place, I reached Ahmedabad. Mehandi's father asked me to look job in other company. So I settled here. I also know the pain of love failure... Listen, my heart is also just like yours! Our manager is from Bombay. If we ask him about knife throwers, it may help to find Jadav. Jadav may lead us to find Mehandi. Let's hope for the best. I give you, Mumbai Circus Association's office address and phone number. -Go and enquire there, ok? -Ok. "Clouds are covering now…!" "Time is passing by...!" "My path keeps extending…" "Oh! Sunny Rain…!" "Oh! My lightening flower... Where did you... go?" "Oh! Sunny Rain…!" "Oh! My lightening flower... Where did you... go?" Knife throwing Jadav... -Knife throwing Jadav? -Yes sir. -You can find him at the back side. -Okay sir. (Indistinct chatter...) Jadav! It's me, Jeeva! Jeeva of Kodaikanal. Brother! How are you? -This is my friend Jeeva! See you later. -I was searching for you allover... (Indistinct chatter...) -Bring us a drink. -Okay Sir. Have it sir. Jadav, how is Mehandi? What an elegant person you were sir? It hurts me to see you like this. Mehandi did too suffer like you sir. She was not able to eat and sleep properly for 4-5 months. She was not even performed in circus. We were totally upset. But her father wanted to end it and forced her to get married. The groom belonged to our community. He didn't know about her love. He adored Mehandi, a lot. She also... accepted the reality. Women can change their mind. A male monkey leaves its grip to clutch a new one. But a female is opposite to it. She has given birth to a female child. Now, Mehandi leads a happy life. Happy, sir. I really pity you sir. Get marry soon and have a baby, sir. Don't be like this. (Indistinct chatter...) Jadav! -Don't tell Mehandi about our meet, right? -Okay. (Indistinct chatter...) Please don't tell. She... Atleast she can be happy. Okay? 'The pain we get in despair is... more dreadful!' Yes, it's true! 'I know how dreadful, the pain we get in despair!' Today I met Jeeva at the market. He came here for a business deal. I didn't expect to meet him after many years. He is looking so great. He got married and having a baby girl. -What are you doing? Have to cook. -It won't take long. Nisha may wakeup. 'Your son has eloped with Mehandi...' I have seen with my own eyes... 'My grandpa was crying and threatening.' 'My mother didn't know what to do.' Does women here have any other choice? (Hindi song playing...) Sir, this is Mehandi! I asked for a job for her, right? Nowadays, there is no income from circus, sir. Yes, I know. -When can she join in the job sir? -She can join from next week. I will bring my wife sir... (Cheerful voices...) (Tamil romantic song playing...) "Oh, my love" 'This song was everything to my mom, then.' "Oh, my love! It's a nice song, right? Alas! 'About you, that song, my hatred father...' '...my mother told everything to me!' Get lost! We dont need you! Don't come back! Go away! What you have done to my mom? Are you really a human? Get lost! My father had been missing since. He didn't return after that incident. Stop the car. My mom became so weak. Last week, she told me that she will die soon. If she sees you, she might recover. My relatives insisted me to bring my dad to meet her. That's why I brougt you. She still listens that song. When she hears that song, her face get glows. She listens it for a whole day. One who is close to heart is the real husband. Physical closeness doesn't matter. You should meet my mother! This happiness only, I can give to my mom. (Indistinct voices...) (Indistinct voices...) Mom! Let's go... Nisha! Nisha! Tell me, mom! (Exhilarated voices...) (Exhilarated voices...) Hey, Get down! Come on quick! (Indistinct voices...) Are you afraid that, I will die? I will be happy even I die now. Come on! (Thrilled reaction and voices...) (Thrilled reaction and voices...) (Thrilled reaction and voices...) (Thrilled reaction and voices...) (Thrilled reaction and voices...) (Thrilled voices...) (Thrilled voices...) (Indistinct voices...) (Indistinct voices...) (Thrilled reaction and voices...) (Cheerful voices...)
