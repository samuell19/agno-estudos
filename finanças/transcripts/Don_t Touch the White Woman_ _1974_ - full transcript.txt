DON'T TOUCH THE WHlTE WOMAN Everything is in shambles. Industry, commerce, cattle farmers, means of communication... The economy is stagnant, progress is at a standstill. And who is responsible for all this? These little rascals. These miserable and dirty individuals, thieves, liars, hypocrites, murderers, vulgar non-believers,,,, It is our fault! We've wasted too much time trying to integrate them... ...to make human beings, civilized men out of them. Gentlemen, my department staff is doing everything they can... ...but it is a very difficult endeavor. They are anarchists! George... Anarchists? You mean savages? Hello! This is Anthropology Professor Pinkerton. We were in college together. These people refuse to recognize the value of private property... ...and how one can benefit from it. They don't accept the selfish principles... ...that were given to human nature by divine providence. And, sir, excuse me. This conversation is confidential. If you wouldn't mind leaving us. Gentlemen, I think it's time we do away with these sub-humans... ...so that our race can accomplish without delay... ...the mission that was entrusted to us: conquer this continent and establish civilization here. Do away? But how? We are responsible. We need to respond to the resistance of these miserable people... ...with a determined and aggressive action... ...even if that should mean the annihilation of these people: men, women and children. It is the only solution if we want to treat the roots of the issue. No, gentlemen! This is impossible! We are not barbarians. The more we kill this year, the less we will have to kill next year. The more I get to know these miserable people... ...the more I think that we either have to kill them all... ...or keep them in an extremely poor condition. In the name of progress, we need to apply, let's say, a final solution. So, who are we going to trust for this mission? This is precisely the problem. We need to be extremely discreet. It's very important. Do not underestimate the influence of the press on public opinion. Remember Watergate. We are not politicians, General. We represent this country's economy. Which means progress and civilization. The army is only the armed division of the country. Precisely. That is why the army must intervene immediately, without hesitation. To defend its highest interests. What about Congress, gentlemen? We are not politicians, General. We represent our country's economy. Which means progress and civilization. Gentlemen, I have given my life to serve my country... ...and I am happy to be given a new opportunity to campaign, I forgot to introduce you to Hermine... ...a poor orphan who follows her father everywhere on the field. My dog. Please. Please. Thank you. Our president's magnetic eyes. General, your life is too precious. You will obviously conduct the operations... ...but as far as direct management on the field... It would be better to choose a less important leader. You must not be at risk. What do you mean, gentlemen? Glory is born out of risk! This project is strange. We are forgetting the essential. We found out your daughter was getting married this fall. Yes, my dear daughter. Please accept these railway bonds as a wedding present. How nice. Let's see. Did you see that, Hermine? How nice these gentlemen are! This will make a nice stipend for you when you become an adult. So, who are you offering me as a leader? Custer. Custer, I should have known. The boy general, is that it? Please, understand us, General. Custer is a legend, a myth. The whole country will rally behind him. Excuse me, gentlemen, I have asthma, Please, leave me. We have something else, General. Get the nails! I need to think about this, gentlemen, This is a very serious decision. What is this about? Nails, For the inauguration of the railway system. How interesting. Daddy, I want to count my bonds. And how many inaugurations can you have with these? 300. 300? Progress is beautiful. We shall cover the country with railways. But Custer is in Washington, ostracized by our president. He won't forgive him for his stance in Congress. Custer has recovered our president's trust. It's your fault, Sitting Bull! You sign peace treaties. And they wipe their ass with our treaties. They wipe their ass with them. This is the soldiers' fury. The wise President Nixon ignores all this. I hope. They devastated our fields. Yes, our fields. They cut down our forests. Yes, our forests. They exterminated our game. Yes, our game. They poison us every day... ...with their alcohol and their flour full of strychnine. But don't listen to me, I'm a madman. We are condemned to die on reservations. They slaughter us as soon as they have a chance... ...but the president doesn't know anything about it. But don't listen to me. I'm a madman. The president doesn't know anything about it. I remember, as they were arriving... They are powerful. You have not traveled. I went to Washington. They are not offering war. They are offering peace. For you, Sitting Bull, making peace really means making peace. For them, it means preparing for a new war. And the next one is imminent. Sitting Bull. -You want some? -Here. Why are you saying that, madman? Because Custer is back. Custer! Custer! Hello, gentlemen. Excuse me, sir. Excuse me, Madam. Well! A comb doesn't just disappear! It was here! I know it! I take it with me in all my battles. -I should have come on my horse. -Darn! Custer! You know me? Who doesn't know the General Custer? May I introduce myself? Professor Pinkerton, Hartford Anthropology Department. Nice meeting you. Well? I can't find it, sir. Here's your comb. -Thank you. -My pleasure. Thank you very much. Anthropologist? Are you sure? Anthropologist, yes. It's Custer! Welcome. My brother, I am late. I had lost my comb. -Really? -Let's go. George, you want some coffee? I had breakfast in the train. It's included in the price. Give me your book. We spent a lot of money, George. We had to find it somewhere. With horse feed on my part and your nephew with the troop rations... ...we accomplished miracles. I don't want to know, Of course, All you care about is your military and political career. You don't realize that many of the journalists... ...who defended you in Washington were paid by us! And nowadays, it is expensive. Here. Well, I need to change. Where can I go? Sergeant! Are you doing all right, Commander? I like chips, There are many kinds, but these are the best. To my taste. You have magnificent hair, General. Yes, it impresses the lndians. Now, you understand why this is important. It's crucial. Anthropologist? Anthropologist. You want some? I only drink coffee in the morning. Look, my old sergeant, I brought you this from Boston. -A telescope, That's very useful. -Thank you, General. Yes. My regiment. May l? Please. The glorious Custer flag. Attention! Scoundrels! You're not soldiers! You're scoundrels! At ease! Look at these. They make wonderful show shoes. Is that my General? Yes. Bastard! Why tomatoes? Custer has arrived. It's over for these wicked lndians. I'm going to get dressed. Family life is over. Wake up! What is this? Idiots! Bastards! The General is here! Don't you know what the army is? Well, wake up! My brother, are these the men I left you? Long live Custer! Long live Custer! Long live Custer! Long live Custer! Long live Custer! Long live Custer! Long live Custer! Custer! Long live Custer! Long live Custer! Long live Custer! Long live Custer! Long live Custer! Long live Custer! Long live Custer! Stop it, enough! Get your guns! Long live Custer! Prepare! Stand at attention! Attention! Shit! Custer! Custer! Old chap... Look, I have a gift for you. It's a scalp. Hello, Colonel. He's always drunk. Let me smell your breath. Things are going to change around here. For you, too, Major Reno. Watch out for the shit, Custer. Second line, first one to the right. Second line, first one! Turn around. An lndian must not witness a white man's punishment. Lick it. It's not my shit. Lick it. Do what he says! Bastard! Colonel Custer! General Terry. In my arms. Beautiful fresco, isn't it? It's our Sistine Chapel. Come, I'm going to introduce you to a few friends. Did you have a nice trip? Very nice, General. What's new in Washington? My only thought was to come back. Colonel, may I introduce you to civil society? First of all, the political power representatives. Please, come forward. Oh, yes. Come here. My daughter Hermine. Our two guardian angels, Sister Lucie, chief infirmary nurse... ...and Marie-Hélène de Boismonfrais, How is your whitlow doing, General? Much better, my dear. Thanks to you. Nothing is more important than meeting with political power Quick! Quick! We'll just do a re-enactment. Everything is possible for the press. Come, Custer is waiting. I like the opera. Mozart? Maybe. Excuse us, General. I'm Kellogg, a journalist. I need to take a picture of you with the people in power, if possible. I'm a military man. Please, this is necessary. For the general public, Colonel. You belong to everyone, Colonel. It is only normal. Thank you, Miss. I will come with you. General, the photographer. Ah, yes, these are futile demands one must abide to. Your dog. Please, place yourselves. I'm sorry, Miss. Let's play some music, for ambiance. Watch out. Don't move. It's my brother, Madam. George Armstrong Custer. Victorious over the lndians. My dog. A present from the Russian Czar. Say hello to the lady. Excuse me. Military information. I walked around a lot in the past few days. I saw a lot of lndians. A lot of them. What tribe? Cheyenne, Oglala, Blackfeet. -No Algerians? -No. That's fame. That's fame, Mitch. Yes. I fed the dog. Very well. Damned lndians. They sleep in there. I don't understand what they want. They live like rats. That's progress. It's dynamic, more convenient. But our century is too pious, too religious, Custer. My dear Custer. I'm happy to be able to count on you. I would have liked to fight the battle myself... ...but with my asthma and my whitlow... I also have a problem. I can't ride my horse anymore. Well, less and less often. I have some sort of rash. The doctor says it isn't serious, but I'm afraid. Well, I'm afraid my prostate is acting funny. Or worse, even. My dear Custer, you're very lucky to be healthy. But you have experience, General. Stop tapping your feet like that. It lifts up the dust, and it's bad for me, There's that shithead Mitch with that asshole Custer. Answer them to make them happy. What are these poor men doing? What are they doing? I don't know these tribes! Are they crazy? They're not allowed to be here. This land belongs to the railway company. Scout! What tribe is this? These are all Sioux. One moment, I'll ask. Shit! Pigs. Is this absolutely necessary? Certainly, It is very important for you to know the power players. Incredible! A military man like me! Forced to go to this grotesque Buffalo Bill exhibition. So, are we going in or what? I repeat, it's very important for you. What do you want? I'm Mitch, Custer's scout. Long live Custer! Hello, Colonel, Hello. I should tell you that Miss de Boismonfrais will be with us tonight. Is that so? She'll think that I'm a tasteless man... ...a man without any artistic sensibility, for choosing this... No, rest assured, she knows your position forces you to be here. -My dear brother, no alcohol. -Just one drink. Since Buffalo Bill didn't wait for us to start. I think I should go ahead and announce your arrival, General. As the great General Sheridan used to say: "General, I will not hunt your buffalo... ...if the great Buffalo Bill doesn't come with me." Buffalo Buffoon! General, I'll be here waiting for your orders. No, Mitch. Don't touch the white woman! Buffoon. Imagine the safari I organized for him. Would you like to drink something? Whisky, cognac, mint? I don't drink. I'll have orange juice. It's war, sir. Whisky or water. Water. -What's your name, Miss? -Rose. Scented? Buffalo Bill. That old fag was my scout for two years. He frequently took the wrong path. Bravo! Bravo! He is here. Mr, Buffalo! And then I told the Great Duke Alexis of Russia the story of my life. Colonel Custer isn't here yet? Sister Lucie! We are here to watch the show. When I was working for the Kansas Pacific Railroad... The Colonel Custer - ...l killed 4,280 buffalos in 18 months! Mr, Buffalo, come with me! Colonel Custer is here! I killed 4,280 buffalos! Buffalos! Buffalos! You can't treat me this way, understood? Custer is waiting for his homage. Quick! That's impossible, I have never done this at the end of my show. My audience is waiting. They want me to tell them about my life, No, you have to do it now. or you will not see one penny of the money you and I agreed upon. And you must look convinced while you're doing it. That bastard. He is always crossing my path. Don't be casual with me. Ladies and gentlemen... ...we have the great honor to have with us tonight... Bravo! -Sister Lucie, please! -...Colonel Custer! Music! Long live Custer! At last, General. Excuse me. Left, right, left, right! Are people this tall nowadays, in West Point? Yes, Colonel. In my time, I was the tallest. Very well. Sit down. Colonel. Look, no alcohol. Very well, Major Reno. Ladies and gentlemen: You know sister Lucie? It is a duty for me to give a public homage... And the representative of the lndian Affairs Department, of course. ...and all my admiration to the hero of Washita. What are you thinking of, Colonel? Nothing. What better comment... Cadet! Yes, Colonel. Cover your fiancée... ...than the letter... How immodest... ...written by General Sheridan... ...to our heroic Colonel when he found out our troops had prevailed. And now I will let General Sheridan speak. "For their energy and swiftness... ...during one of the worst snowfalls this part of the country had ever seen... ...with temperatures below 30°F, for his bravery..." -Why do you risk your life like that? -For my country! "For their triumph over the ferocious Cheyenne... ...the Joint Chief of Staff wants to thank the soldiers and officers... ...who fought in the battle of Washita... ...and particularly their distinguished leader. Major General George Armstrong Custer." Put the light on him! Long live Custer! Long live Buffalo! Heroic brothers! You... With this image. Such emotion. Does cigar smoke bother you, Miss? Thank you. What a battle, General! I don't know how to explain it. When I saw you for the first time, I had a strange feeling. A premonition, a memory. Maureen O'Hara, Gone With the Wind. You're flattering me, Colonel. No, Miss de Boismonfrais, I'm just honoring the truth. You must believe me. If I may ask, how did you end up here with us? When my father died... Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't want you to recall such feelings. My mother was penniless and agreed to accept her brother's hospitality. My uncle owns a bank in Boston. and his wife is a direct descendant of the Mayflower pilgrims. This music is so melancholic. I was bored in Boston. Life was superficial, Dances, parties, you know. So when I heard how much American soldiers were suffering. I decided to offer my help to serve our cause. General Terry says you're a fairy, He's wrong. You're an angel, Miss de Boismonfrais. Being nursed by you must be something divine. No, Colonel. Bullets must respect you. The country needs you. We're going to play a game. Don't cry, It's a game. I don't want this. I want to leave! Old hag! Let's go. Then they locked them up. The chimney fell and killed them all. Go sit down. Sitting Bull, what are you waiting for? For them to kill us all? We need to go get our brothers. They killed them like animals. What are you waiting for? -Custer, the butcher of lndians. -Come. What do you want, Sitting Bull? Go and get the warlords. Two-Moons, Faithful, Crazy Horse, Raven. You're crazy if you think you're going to stop progress... ...by killing American soldiers. America could be your father and your mother. Bravo! -Thanks. -You're welcome. And the people, your children. In the name of my government, you'll be put to death by hanging. Shut up! Hang them! -WATCH OUT FOR lNDlANS -Watch out for nothing! May I speak? You may speak, madman. Brothers, until now, you've fought with no strategic insight. You can't speak! You're not a chief. A man with no hair on his head is not a man. -What's he talking about? -He's talking about war. He's talking about war? We must not talk about war. The madman has no hair, but he has ideas. Let's listen to him. Speak, madman. You're the most valiant warriors on Earth. But you're naive. For you, war is about individual accomplishment. not collective action. Collective! Collective! Shut up. We shall speak to our brothers, the warriors. What's the violin for? I really enjoy playing the violin in the countryside, Don't mock the tradition, madman. If they want war, they'll have war. But in order to wage war, we must unite. For if we fight each on our own, as we have done until now... ...we'll never be able to beat them. You've heard Sitting Bull. The time of unity has come. Apart, you are nothing. The white men will go on destroying tribe after tribe. If all tribes are united, we form a people. Not poor, not disowned, but oppressed men. Men! The people can overcome the oppressor! Brothers, forget your differences. Let's gather the little that everyone owns! Let's buy weapons! Use this for collective action, new tactics. We don't need heroes, but we need an army. Not tomorrow but now, now, now! They're coming back, the rascals! Cut his head off. Like this. Come on! Brothers! Brothers! Brothers! If we continue to wait, they'll kill us all, one by one. You're the most revered, the most respected of us all. Look! Look! Huh? If I were young and impetuous like you. I would think today is a good day to launch an attack. But I'm old and wise, and I know we must wait. Nobody is contesting your authority, chief. But the young men cannot wait any longer. Go on, work. Or I will have you killed by my soldiers. -So what's wrong with you? -Nothing. Why are you looking at me this way, huh? Leave me alone and cover yourself. You look like a white slut. We'll go to the movies tomorrow. In memory of Lee Nelson who killed 98 lndians during his lifetime. What I don't understand is the lndians' attitude. It's obvious that the Lord gave this land to white men... ...so they could settle here. So why do they resist? Because they're savages! They're savages! I sometimes feel like they're possessed by demons. May God preserve us from that! God and the 7th Cavalry. These military buildings are strange. They are military-like. So, it is indeed a pious act to kill lndians. lsn't that right, Colonel? What a beautiful sky! Look at all these stars, Colonel. Look! Look, the stars have fallen to Earth. Stars... Mitch! Screw you! They're Blackfeet. I tricked them again. Are they lndians? With me by your side, you have nothing to fear. Miss de Boismonfrais. -You can call me Marie-Hélène. -Champagne, Mitch! Don't you smell something strange? Yes, of course! Look at these dead men hanging. I can't believe this. If there's one thing that I demand, it's cleanliness! Where's the formaldehyde? Champagne is for white men. Mitch! Champagne is for white men. Custer, son of a bitch! Here, take this. Marie-Hélène, lndians are savages. I sometimes feel like they're possessed by demons. Custer, you're a piece of shit. Mitch, leave the white woman alone. Here! Come here! You, keep working! The president is watching you. Come here. What do you want? We'll see if I can't touch the white woman. Come with me. Come here! Go up there, Go on! Not like that, like this. Look, she's white. White as an angel. White as milk. Turn around. It's just you and l. Turn around, dear Madame. Will you let me touch your ass, Miss de Bonbonbon? Yes? That's good. Not too big, not too small. Just right. Oh la la! Custer, do you realize? She loves an lndian! Take your clothes off! Naked, Marie-Hélène. Custer, look. I'll fuck you up the ass! -What is this? -Leave me alone. Watch out! Good morning, General. -Good morning, Professor. -Did you sleep well? No, The bed is too soft, I prefer sleeping on the ground. The warrior's rest. I was just at the lndian School. We are setting up an exhibition... ...a rather sad but necessary exhibition. Marie-Hélène is there, too. You know her. She is an extraordinary woman. A true patriot. She's been helping us since 4:00 am. Every time I travel... ...I unfortunately have to organize this kind of exhibition. I have some photographs. Are you interested? Do you want to see them? Look at this. This one is from an exhibition in Bolivia. Yes. This one is in Africa. Revolutionary leader? Look at this one, lsn't it beautiful? What's going on, my little lndian? That's not very good publicity for you, the way he treats your scout. I can do it myself. If you do it, it's entirely different, really. Very interesting. Congratulations, Professor. You stay here. We'll go see that. Anthropologist? Anthropologist. I thought it over, and I'm very happy. because thanks to the newspapers... -Hello, Archibald. -Hello, darling. No, this is not a good time for breakfast. Thanks, anyway. That's obvious. It doesn't smell like lilies. So the newspapers work well because the acid allows... My goodness. That smell... It's interesting. Yes. You know that the English eat fries in newspapers. Oh, dear. And this one... What are you doing in our school? It's no longer your school, Miss. We're occupying it. You can stay here, if you wish. It's a horrible spectacle for children. Okay, now it's a little cleaner. Juju, come help me clean this guy. Do you see what we do to lndians when they're mean? So you have to be very nice. Either he's taking his revenge, or there are too many newspapers. Come help me! Quick! Come on! Come here. The coffee is going to be cold. Excuse me, but I had to finish this stuff. -Do you want some coffee? -It's a nice thought. Marie-Hélène, do you want some coffee? No, it's too strong for me. I'll gladly have some. Is it good? Did you make it? No, I got it next door. Your wife asked for 2,000 dollars. I only have 1,000. I don't know where to get it. You're the one who's dealing with money. -Hello, soldier. -Hello. Yes, here it is. I invented the concept. I empty their bowels, and then I fill them up with newspapers, hay, etc. Good. The smell is unbearable. Yes, that's from the acid in the newspapers. It acts as a disinfectant. But thanks a lot, anyway. Did you work all night? Well, I helped Archibald, the veterinarian. Now that they've been disinfected. they can be on display without being a risk for the population. You're always so considerate. Hello, children. Hello. It's beautiful to help a noble cause. When is the battle taking place? Top secret. But I can say it to you. You're shaking. No. Yes. Well... I think I am tired. Should I walk you to your hotel? No, duty first, Colonel. An angel. Come with me. ClTlZENS BlG EXHlBlTlON 5 "EMBALMED" HOSTlLE lNDlANS ADMlSSlON 5 CENTS PROFlTS GO TO WAR WlDOWS Listen, Archibald. Admission must be 15 cents. I need money. Major Archibald, come on. Miss de Boismonfrais. The white angel of the white soldier. Come on. No. Come on! Buffalo Bill! I always have to run into him. Let's immortalize a historical moment. Come on! Come on! Buffalo Bill! Oh, come now. Don't move! Talk some more. Tell me how great you think this beautiful weapon is. This is an admirable machine gun. It comes from France, a European country. 60 shots per minute. At ease, Custer. I see that you've received your horrible toy. It's a beautiful toy, Custer. Don't be negative about it. I said, at ease. How is your health, General? Very bad, thanks. I had a terrible heat stroke... ...such bad sunburns on my hands that I can never lift my sword again... ...and I think you could cook some bacon on my head. I am sorry, General. You can be. Excuse me, General, can we have a word in private? You can speak in front of this gentleman. You know him very well. The right to being informed is sacred. He is on our side anyway, so go ahead. The presence of a clown in your army is not acceptable and dishonorable. I am talking about Buffalo Bill, obviously. I sort of agree with you. Please, explain it to him. My dear General... ...the war against the lndians is not very popular in the country. In Europe, people are against it. We must therefore launch... ...a big publicity and public relations campaign, etc. Anything we can do to reinforce our control. People like Buffalo Bill a lot. The war is not popular? War is the essence of a people. But not with this machine! With a sword! Man to man. Charge! At ease, Custer. Don't be obsessed with Buffalo Bill. He represents the folklore in our project. You are the glory. You wage war in its essence, its primal truth. Well, then! By the way, I'm meeting with Sitting Bull tomorrow. Do you want to come with me? Thank you, General. Come over here, Custer. I have a rather confidential matter to ask you about. I have issues with my daughter. She's seeing one of your officers who is a bit of a drunk. Major Reno? Yes. Tell me something. Does he go to the brothel? I have no idea, but I can tell you he's stopped drinking. Drinking isn't the problem, Custer. Sometimes, myself... No. I'm afraid he'll give my daughter a shameful disease. Another herd of lndians! They'll end up filling up this hole. About Sitting Bull... About Sitting Bull. I had a brilliant idea, Custer. Sometimes my intelligence scares me. In order for war to be popular, it has to be inevitable. I found one reason for it to be so. When are we fighting? Glory, Custer. You always want glory. At ease, Custer. Are you the madman? Aren't you ashamed of being naked in front of children? We know each other, don't we, Chief? I brought you a few gifts, to prove our friendship. But I see you haven't brought me anything. My daughter wanted a pair of moccasins. She'll be very disappointed. We have nothing to give. I chose the white men. I only work with them. Scout! My seat! At your service! You'll see. Your friend, Colonel Custer. is going to tell you about the orders given by our beloved President Nixon. Go ahead, Custer. It's him! Why did you abandon your houses? Because you destroyed them. Sometimes there were still people inside of them. You were ordered to go to the reservations. My people are dying of hunger in the reservations. You promised us work, schools for our children, hospitals... ...for everything you have taken from us. This is not a proper answer. And even if it was... ...it doesn't give you the right... ...to occupy the big hole of the Black Hills. The big hole of the Black Hills... That's all we have left. Our country does not want war! So why are you here? Indian murderer. In the name of our government. I order you to go back to your reservations before the next moon. If you refuse to comply, you will be declared hostile... ...hence rebels and enemies of our country. Therefore, you will be responsible for everything that will happen. Please note our magnanimous attitude... ...and the lack of responsibility of these savages. I saw everything. I wrote it all down. Well, I think it's time to have lunch. Come on, let's go. Let's go! This piece of shit was given to me... ...by the Great white old man in Washington. I piss on it now. Custer... An officer who has gone through West Point... ...does not lower himself to this type of scuffle. Come on. Go back home! Go away, birds of hell! Get out of here! Come on, out! Father. Why didn't you defend me? Because I was eating cherries. Go fetch my horse. Major Reno. I hope you've read Colonel Custer's book. I have not read it, but I definitely intend to do so. Marie-Hélène, I really didn't expect to see you here, Miss. Colonel, I was so happy at the idea... ...of getting a dedicated copy of your book. You read it? Who hasn't, Colonel! Not only are you a great soldier, but also a great poet. I remember one of the passages. It starts like this: The night was ideal... To put our project to fruition... The breeze was sweet and fresh... And the full moon... Seemed to be on our side... In the attack of the Indian camp... I'm embarrassed to hear your praise. This is nothing but a soldier's prose. Buffalo Bill's cow! Oh, Colonel! Very nice to see you. I suppose you don't see a problem if I sign? -Let's go. -My great autobiography. "The attack of the stagecoach, the buffalo hunt... The scalping technique, etc." I see the lndian Affairs representative. For the lndian Affairs representative, I have a gift. Here it is, for the lndian Affairs representative. That's the gift. Relax, Colonel. If you'll excuse me... Pitiful buffoon. Him and his mistress, Calamity Jane! No scandal. We need him. Ouch! Long live Custer! Long live Buffalo! For the lady! Don't worry. I'm looking after her. Marie-Hélène, I had a fantastic horse ride. You never told me why you chose a military career. Since I was young, I've felt a burning desire to serve the country. What convinced me to join the army... ...was the confusion that was everywhere in the country. The army represented purity, sacrifice. Purity, in the midst of a society... ...plunged into materialism and anarchy. How I like listening to you! You speak so well! Alas, you're not the only one. Alas? Why? My speeches in Washington were rather successful. Some very influential people insist for me to campaign... ...and run for presidential elections. President? Yes. Custer, president! The night is beautiful, but I'm starting to be a little cold. Let me walk you. He always gives me delicate missions. But you're a great man. Oh! Yes. What a soldier. The only thing he does is ride a horse under a full moon. And we're here, waiting for him to get rid of the lndians for us. Damned lndians! How many cannons can we have? At least half a dozen, my dear friend. Watch out, Buffalo. Fire! Well done. Well done. That's real war. You don't like progress, Colonel. Progress! And now, the cannon number. These machines have no humanity. Custer, you are right. No cannons. Revolvers, shotguns, knives, but no cannons. No cannons. You see, General, the time of scientific wars has come. It is clean, anonymous. You don't see your enemy. But you chose Custer, right? Well, you shall get Custer. Custer is all about glory, charging with a small weapon. We'll see. Lift your arms! Take these cannons back to the store. Let's go to the Joint Chief of Staff meeting, my friend. Bring the box. Proceed. Hook it up. Come on, now. Hermine, you can't fall asleep... ...in the middle of these secret documents... ...right as the war council is about to start. Go get some fresh air, sweetheart. Please excuse her. She follows me in all my campaigns. That's enough. Here. Gentlemen, the president. Let's not forget him and his magnetic gaze. The plan is the following. The column led by Crook exits Fort Fetterman and walks up North... ...pushing the enemy back if they appear, until this place. The column led by Gibbon exits Fort Ellis... ...and, coming down this path, joins with our friend Custer's men. Take it easy Custer, It creates dust. I've already told you that. I hope you're following me, gentlemen. An elegant and inescapable pliers movement... ...which will corner the enemy's ass, if I may say... ...in a magnificent cul-de-sac. What do you think, Custer? Major... Very funny, Custer. Very subtle. Don't forget that this battle plan is based on your sense of cooperation. Of collaboration, Custer. This is not a personal adventure. Do not forget. Yes, General. -Understood? -Yes, General. And don't forget your trial. So with this operation, you can promise us a definite success. There will be no survivors, correct? It has to be a complete victory. A clear, sharp, definite victory. Gentlemen, this is in the hands of Colonel Custer. So, you go in slowly, as if you were notables, and you ask for weapons. Go ahead! Go ahead! Go ahead! Go ahead! Chief, quick! Come in. Oh, a shotgun. It's beautiful. We're going to kill them all with this. Madman! I need to have a word with you. Here, a gift. Tomatoes. Here, our good president. Those are only my pants. Ah, madman. You always have fun throwing tomatoes at my face. Fine. Throw them. Come on, I'm here. Be brave. Throw them. I know you're getting weapons. It means that war is imminent. I don't care whether you win or lose. I only want one thing. You need to kill Custer. Should I keep talking or should I shut up? Speak. Custer loves to change clothes. He has a different uniform for every battle. This time, I'm going to give him a beige uniform. He'll be very easy to spot among the soldiers. Why do you want Custer to die? That's my business. Why do you want Custer to die? Because he treats me like an lndian. What massage, Colonel? You need to cut your hair. There is no other option. Your hair is too fragile. My hair is my legend. I can't cut it. Colonel! Shit! I can't! Indians call me Custer Long Hair, lsn't it true? Sure, Custer. And if I don't cut it... You'll be bald, Colonel. Cut it. A man without hair loses his masculinity. General, look at this uniform. I made it for you with my own hands. Completely. I did it all myself. Look how beautiful it is. Well done. You're all savages, but you do very well with that type of thing. What is this? An amulet. No, General. That's not a good amulet, General. That's bad. I don't know lndian customs. But you must, since you're a gynecologist. Anthropologist. I know lndians very well. Right, little lndian? Sitting Bull will be disappointed. And now there are people everywhere, in the hole. They have many weapons, much to drink and much to eat. These holes are well-cared for by our brothers. Today is a big day. -Where do you come from? -Mexico. Sitting Bull, they are coming from everywhere. Our plan is working. Lots of lndians. They finally understand. This time, we are going to slaughter the oppressor. Please, gentlemen, go ahead. I'm sorry I'm not sharing your green beans... ...but it's not allowed in my diet. I have to be content with this humble crayfish. Please, eat your green beans. Tell me about you. There are many things I had never done... ....before knowing you, Marie-Hélène. Like what? Being in love. Custer, for the country, for God, and for your glory! For the army! For progress! Cheers, gentlemen! I love my wife, naturally. But it's a different kind of love. I love her like a sister, like a mother, a daughter. The feelings you inspire in me, Marie-Hélène... My love is immense. I feel the irresistible desire to kiss you... ...to hold you in my arms with a frenzy. No, no, Colonel. No, George Armstrong. I'm a decent girl. I love you, too, but you must respect my virtue. I feel faint, I can't breathe. I don't feel well. I'm an animal for talking to you that way. Please. Please, come, I need some air. Relax, gentlemen. Do you need help, Colonel Custer? No, thank you. I would like to go to my hotel. Yes. -To my hotel. -Yes. Ah, women. They're so fragile. Now that the women are gone, we can be a little more casual. Good evening, General. I'll help you, Madam. Don't touch the white woman! Marie-Hélène, you have nothing to fear. My love is so immense that I'm ready to make a sacrifice. I'm happy just to see you. -Yes, let's leave. -Sure. Champagne! I'm mainly used to treating animals, but it doesn't matter. You're not pregnant? How dare you? -Sorry, a faux-pas, General. -Can you introduce me? General, let me introduce you to my fiancée. Good evening, General. Major Archibald, this is the fourth time you're introducing her. Another faux-pas, General. You must forgive me, Marie-Hélène. I didn't want to offend you. I had a weak moment. The flesh is weak. I don't need to forgive you, George Armstrong. I'm the happiest of all women. Is that true? It's so beautiful to feel loved so passionately... ...by a man who can renounce the prosaic materiality of love. That is how I love you, Marie-Hélène. I think I'm going to go. I'll walk you. Dear wife. Today, I won a great victory. Maybe more important to me personally... ...than all my military victories. Marie-Hélène. George Armstrong. Since you didn't have dinner, I thought... I brought you a club sandwich. Adorable Samaritan. You must eat. Eat? In my condition? Excuse me. Is this where you write your memoirs? Yes, I was writing to my wife. What a lucky woman. Marie-Hélène. Yes? My blood is burning. My poor little heart is like a pony galloping too fast. -Please... -Yes? We must resist. Yes, yes. I feel so perturbed. -My poor little heart. -Marie-Hélène... ...is a wounded pony. Please, Marie-Hélène. We must resist! -Yes! -We must resist, Marie-Hélène. Yes! Excuse me, but where did you learn to do that? Carrying wounded soldiers. For the country! George Armstrong. Marie-Hélène... Take me! Take me! Mr, Buffalo, this is not the right time or the right place for you. My place is always where America calls me to be. But you're supposed to follow my orders. Glory and victory! Music! I order you! That's all we needed. A clown among my soldiers. My white angel. That Buffalo Bill is unbelievable. He would do anything to steal some of General Custer's glory. Absolutely. Remember you went to West Point, General. Stay calm and remain elegant. You are the glory. General, get ready! Buffalo Bill is leaving with you. Glory to the flag! What is going on? A little technical problem. How long is this going to take? An hour. Do you realize that a battle is starting? Your machine is obviously modern and beautiful... ...but it doesn't seem to work very well. I'm warning you, General. If Buffalo Bill does his little number among my soldiers during the battle. I will not miss an opportunity to kill him. I understand, but I don't want to know anything about it. I have no affinity for this comedian. But whatever you do, I don't want to know about it. Calm down. General, your men are very beautiful! Thank you, Buffalo -I find them... -These are my men! They are my 7th brigade! Let me finish my speech. These men I just inspected are absolutely splendid! And I am proud, General, to be one of your men. Yes, thank you. Please, go now. -They are real soldiers, yes! -Get out of here! Yes, General. Excuse me, General. And you, Buffalo Bill, will not get any more money from us. General, allow me to walk with my troops. Granted, Custer. But do not forget. Even if you spot the enemy... ...you must only attack after communicating... ...with Crook's and Gibbon's columns. Do not attack by yourself! Go ahead. Do not forget. Do not attack by yourself. Leave a little bit of glory for them. Farewell, my brave soldiers! And don't forget! For the country, always! Go! It's time to go. I'm leaving you with my little man. Give Daddy a kiss. Here. Be careful, Mitch. Don't get killed. Me? Get killed? Never! Don't look at the soldiers. They're not soldiers. They're ghosts! Look at the sky! It is beautiful! Go ahead! Go on! I found a nice little blonde in Baltimore. It's horrible. I have to stay here and play the fool with all these knuckleheads. You're really lucky. After this, I'm going to Chile. Stop, It's depressing. There we go. It's happened again! Colonel Custer is firing Major Reno. He wants to act by himself. He can't help it. He's going to get it when he comes back. For the country! This is a big day for us. Come on! The young must protect the elders. Go ahead. Go ahead. Come on. Mothers, protect the young. Go ahead. Dirty lndians! You're dead! Wait. We must wait. Those are the orders from General Terry. Do you remember Washita? If I'd waited, there would've been no Washita. Wait for what? They're all here. Look at that. Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse. My prey is escaping. At least a thousand. This is going to be a good show. General, you'd promised to be nice to the lndians. We're planning to be, my friend. So, my little Hermine? Still absorbed in your Emily Bronte book? -Yes. -That's good. My dear Anthropology Professor! I knew it. I'm leaving, General. I'm done with my work. Where are you going? Home. Don't tell my wife about Marie-Hélène. I need to think about it. I'm very discreet. What are we waiting for? I want to charge, I'm going to charge! Please, calm down. My prey is escaping! Watch out, brother! You have to go around them! He was found guilty. Hold your horses. Sergeant, watch your men. My stomach! To have a stomachache on the battlefield... It's awful! It hurts! I can't fight! Are you wounded? No, I'm in pain. My stomach... Wait. Should I finish him? You're scared, huh? Buffalo! Excuse me, Madam. Buffalo! Lay on the ground! -He's giving up. -Buffalo Bill... Custer is going to remain by himself in combat... ...and he'll get all the glory from the victory! Calm down. Congratulations, Custer. Come, Marie-Hélène. Put your clothes back on in front of these ladies, buffoon. He doesn't deserve your hand. He is a coward. I need water! He's very sensitive. He gives a pathetic example. I've finished examining the animals, and their excrements are clear. May I be relieved, General? You may. Good. Excuse me. How beautiful. Too bad there are so many lndians. Yes. When does the battle start, George Armstrong? I don't know, my dear. I must wait. Wait. Did you see all this big game? But I must wait for General Gibbon. Another one of General Terry's ideas. I think he's jealous of your glory. Of my glory and of my presidential stature. Yes. Oh! They really are wild animals. How are you feeling, Marie-Hélène? Good, but a little bashful. What opinion must you have of me, after what happened last night? George Armstrong. Together forever-- Marie-Hélène... Forever. Marie-Hélène, the white angel. She's dead No kidding. Glory to our heroine! Tonight... Careful. -On stage, the theater will be full! -Very well. Ah, my stomach! Be brave. Stand. Custer! It's over for you! Damned butcher! Trumpet. Play! Charge! Kill them all! No mercy! Charge! Kill the warriors first! Where are all those lndians coming from? Where were they hiding? They are crazy! That is not a proper way to make war! Gather the troops! Regroup! Gather the troops! Come back this way! Regroup! Everybody go this way! Let's go! Collective action. Collective Tomorrow all the Americans will be dead. And now I shall go kill Custer. You're as old as a child, and children must not fight. Companions, gather! Form a circle! Form a circle! Damned lndians! They don't know how to fight a war! Form a circle! Surrender! Indian warriors! Where are the warriors of the old days. who would fight alone against 100 guns? Reload your gun. I can't, It's blocked. You can't reload the bullets. Impossible! It's the latest American army model! The American army is finished, that's all Where's your horse, Archibald? I was the first. Watch out! On the left! Hi, ho, brave men! We need to finish these lndians! Charge, 7th Cavalry! "Don't touch the white woman." It's not the best, but it hurts. Are you all right, Archibald? If you could move your butt, I'm already... Whoever dies for the country hasn't lived in vain. I, on the contrary, will live for the country... ...because I'm not that stupid. -Brother! -Are you fatally wounded, brother? It's pointless, I'm dying. The administration... I checked the accounts day by day. You killed Marie-Hélène, my brother. You killed all my comrades. Play the trumpet! It's a slaughter! I will kill you all! All! Play the trumpet! I think we really lost, this time. That Custer is a complete idiot. That doesn't surprise me. I told you. Look at what he's doing. He's unable to win against a few miserable lndians. I think we must sell everything. So? Pass the message. Now? Right away. I am the father. I can do whatever I want. Where is Custer? Shot dead, General! -I killed him. -Yes. -I'm really happy. -Yes! We must leave right away. That's the only thing to do. -Wait! -Are you ready? -Gentlemen! Don't leave this way. -Wait. I have the heroine's body. I'm responsible. -She is dead. -Yes. We need to be transported. -I have her body. -There's no room. What do you mean, there's no room? It's me! There's no room. I have a right to transportation! Let her rot here. Pretty simple. Let's fly. This isn't important. Wait! I'm Mitch, Custer's scout! Jerks! Bastards! White savages! White savages! I'm the one who killed Custer. I'm very happy. There will be other battles to win, other Custers! Yes, many other Custers are alive. There will be other Custers to kill, Sitting Bull! Daddy! What is this? Look what I found. It's adorable. So cute. What are you doing? So cute. What's that? "Sell all your railway bonds immediately." -What is it? -My God! Dad? -Dad? -Out of my way, sweetheart! Can I keep it, Dad? Do whatever you want with your damned pigeon! This is not the 7th Cavalry! These are lndians entering the city! Good Lord! Over there, as well! Indians... This wasn't planned. Out! Out!
