It's hard to believe such a thing could be true. And I hope such a thing never happens to you. But it happened they say, to poor Mayzie McGrew. Alright, children. Settle down now. Open your books at page 24, children. It happened like this. She was sitting one day at her desk in the school in her usual way... When she felt a small twitch on the top of her head. So Mayzie looked up, and she almost dropped dead. Something peculiar was going on there. A daisy had sprouted right out of her hair! Behind her was sitting young Herman Butch Stroodle. This looks like a daisy up here on her noodle. It doesn't make sense, why it couldn't be so! A noodle's no place for a daisy to grow. Then, upspoke another boy, Einstein Van Tess. The brightest young boy in the whole of the class. It's a very odd place to be sprouting a daisy, but nevertheless, one is growing on Mayzie. Hey! Look what's happening here in this room. Daisy-Head Mayzie, she's bursting in bloom! Miss Sneetcher, her teacher, came rushing up quick. Such nonsense, some child here is playing a trick. Which one of you boys stuck that thing in her hair? You know that a daisy could never grow there. But teacher, Ms. Sneetcher, I saw the thing rise. Right out of her head with my very own eyes! Just give it a yank if you think he tells lies. I've had quite enough of this foolishness talk. Uh, Mayzie, hold still, let me get at that stalk. Ouch! You better quit yanking, you're giving her pain. I'll bet that those roots go way down in her brain. ♪ Daisy-Head, Daisy-Head, Daisy-Head Mayzie ♪ Uh, children! Be quiet! Good grief and alas.

Just as soon as it's dead, take her back to class. Then, the principal saw a most terrible sight. The daisy was dying. And that was alright, but that daisy was part of poor Mayzie McGrew. And Mayzie was starting to wilt away too! Teacher, Ms. Sneetcher! Know what I think? They're both going to wilt! Quick, bring them a drink! Oh, my! Oh! That daisy... That girl's the worst problem in town. You take her away and you make her lie down! Lock her up tight in that room down the hall. There's quite a few people that I've got to call. Get Mayzie's parents on the end of the line. I need them here quickly, while there's still time. Mrs. McGrew, what's all the fuss? Goodness to Betsy, I'll catch the next bus! Quickly, I need Mr. McGrew! - Are you McGrew? - Mhm. Call for you. Yes, this is... What?! I'll be there in a dot! My shoe, McGrew! My shoe! That's quite a neat trick! I'll be there in a tick! We need all the help we can get! Then I'll come along too, my brother's a vet. Finch the Florist. Roses, carnations, holly. What?! You mean up here?! I'll be right over! My, oh my. Bees?! Uh-oh. Phew! Oh! Mr. McGrew, my shoe! My shoe, Mcgrew! My shoe! My, oh my. Wait! How do you do, I'm Mr. McGrew. Where is my daughter? Uh, I thought she was with you. - Uh, no. I, but I was here. - I believe that's my shoe. - McGrew. Well, I won't leave... - Uh, who is this... Dr. Eiseinbart. - Please let me, through. - Aah! Aah! My poor little daughter! The daisy!

Don't be a fool! Don't turn your back on your friends and the school! But Mayzie didn't stop to blink. She signed her name in Think-Proof ink! Your flower needs to sign too. Just a floral-mality. You understand. Mayzie, Mayzie, what have you done? I'm going to be famous, and have lots of fun! Daisy-Head Fever is gripping the nation! It’s quickly becoming a worldwide sensation! Can I speak to my daughter? It's Mrs. McGrew. Sorry, she’s busy 'till, uh... 4002. Daisy-head burgers, and daisy-head drinks. Daisy-head stockings, and daisy-head sinks? Daisy-head buttons, and Daisy-head bows. Mayzie was famous, the star of her shows. See Daisy-Head Mayzie! It's not much to pay. A daffy and dazzling new Daisy Ballet. Don't be shy, lady. Have a good stare. At the girl with a daisy, that grows from her hair! Fame had knocked on Mayzie's door. Come in! And now, she had it all, and more. She had all her money, stacked up in tens. But what good is money, without all your friends? She had found her dream, but lost her way. That was a price she just couldn't pay! So Mayzie McGrew, she ran night and day. With nowhere to go and nowhere to stay. I can never go home. Nobody loves me. Nobody loved her, poor Mayzie McGrew. It's hard to believe, such a thing could be true. And maybe that's why then, this daisy above. when Mayzie below began talking of love. Well, you know about daisies when love is in doubt. The job of a daisy is try and find out. They love her, they love her not, they love her, they love her not. They love me. They love me not. They love me? They love me not?! Don't worry Mayzie, they love you! They love me! And that's the moral of this story. Love means more than fame and glory. Well, that’s how it happened. The thing went away. And Mayzie McGrew is quite happy today. Back at her studies and doing just great. In all of her subjects, in room number 8. And concerning that daisy... You know that it never grew out of the top of her head again ever. Um... Well, it practically never popped up there again. Except occasionally, just now and then. And after all, I am getting used to it!
