(SOFT OMINOUS MUSIC) (MR. PEARSON SIGHS) Where the hell have you been? I got here as fast as legally possible. Do you have my will? Yes, sir. (GEORGE COUGHING) I think we should take him to the hospital. No, George wants to stay at home. Reminds him of his wife and his daughter. Don't you think we should... The will. I want to change it. Stacey, could you please leave us? Thank you. (SOFT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) I, George Woods, declare this to be my last will and testament. (DOOR CREAKS) I revoke all wills and codicils previously made. (GEORGE COUGHING) So, you want your will to be read 10 years after you're deceased? That's not typically how it's done, - but I don't see any reason... - Do it. MR. PEARSON: What if they find Mona by then? Then read it immediately. And the envelopes? Notarize them as soon as possible. I understand, all under the 10 year term. (GEORGE COUGHING) Stacey! (GEORGE COUGHING) (STACEY WHIMPERS) (GEORGE GASPS) George. George. (CHURCH BELLS RINGING) (PHONE RINGING) 20 observers have... Hello? CHARLIE: Hey, Scott? It's Charlie. Charlie. What the hell do you want? Listen, you get a letter from Uncle George's lawyer? Yeah, so? Yeah, we need to talk. SCOTT: About what? Your wife, Mona. Go ahead. Found this old photo of Mona, thought you might wanna check, actually, you know what? I'll show it to you at the cabin. Later. Wait. Charlie. (SOFT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Hello? No. Yes, I'll be home as soon as this will is read. Just tell Jacob, tell Jacob I'll make the game. Yes. I just have to take care of a few things up here first. Love you. Oh hey, that's Uncle Charlie. But I guess he didn't see us. (BRENDA SIGHS) (DOORKNOCKER THUDS) Oh, Mr. Pearson? That's me. BRENDA: It's good to see you. I know, it's been quite a while. Sorry for the intrusion but you know this was Mr. Woods' idea. Oh, there's no need to apologize. I completely understand. Besides, this was George's place anyway. Oh please, come in, come in. (KNUCKLES TAPPING) Stacey. It's so good to see you. STACEY: Good to see you, too, Brenda. Oh, and who is this handsome young man? This is my grandson, Jeff. He was about, oh, this tall when last you saw him. Right. It's been more than 10 years since George passed. Guess we got the whole friggin' weekend for a little dysfunctional family reunion. So, what do ya think, Scott? I don't have time for this shit, Charlie. Mind if I show you a photo I found? (OMINOUS MUSIC) What is this? I thought you said you had a photo of Mona. It's in the car. I'll show you that one later. Just found this baby stashed in here. (CHUCKLES) That woman is a total bitch. She tried to seduce Uncle George out of his cash. I caught them once before. George passed away a long time ago, Charlie. Whatever happened, happened. Thanks for your help on the side of the road. Sure. And just so ya know, I've gathered everybody's dirt. So? So, get ready for the Woods family who done it Wheel of Fortune. I hate you. (CHARLIE GRUNTS) - (OMINOUS MUSIC) - Everything's fine. - KATHERINE: Great. STACEY: Katharine. Do you remember this photo? (BRIGHT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (LAUGHS) Nice. I was just telling Randy that we all haven't been together since this Halloween party. Lots of great old photos around here. Right, Brenda? Please behave yourself, Charlie. Ah, that's no fun. I think this gathering is gonna be even better than the party. Thanks for hosting us, Brenda. (BRENDA CHUCKLES) Charlie, stop causing trouble and come take a look at this. Have you seen it before? I have. Then it disappeared. I thought Uncle George didn't like it so he threw it away. Yeah, he was going to but I brought it here. See, that's me. I'm the witch. (CHARLIE AND KATHARINE CHUCKLE) What did you wear, Charlie? Were you Casper? No, no way. I hate Casper. Randy, remember who Casper was at the party? Me? No. I was completely drunk. I think I slept through most of the party. Oh yeah, yeah, that's right. You snore like a dead hog when you're drunk. I remember having to drive you home that night. All right, come on, let's do this. Whoa, whoa, whoa, steady. - Steady. - Oh, here we are. Hey, goodnight everybody! - Bye! - Woo! CHARLIE: Here we are. In ya go. Damn lawyer asked me a bunch of questions like I'm a criminal. If Nadia's not gonna get her cut, then we don't need to be here. Yeah, I agree. Honestly, I don't even know why I'm included in this. I thought Uncle George never liked me. You were always his favorite nephew, Randy. You and Charlie. Yeah right. Charlie's different, he worked for George. Me? Ask Stacey. George treated me better as an employee than a nephew. No, wait, I take that back. I got diddly squat when I worked for the old man. Ooh, but maybe you shouldn't blame that on Uncle George. I mean, you put it all up your nose. The old bastard owes me back pay. But you lost half the business. And Charlie, you burned me, too, remember? I loaned you the money for that shady deal you put together. I never got any money back from it. Shut up, Brenda. I know all your dirty secrets. Well we shouldn't argue. I'm sure George left you all a little something and of course it's only fair to consider me as a part of that... CHARLIE: So take all of his cash to your grave. Listen, Mr. Cocaine, I'm looking out for my grandson. I'm outta here. Me, too. CHARLIE: Hey, Mandy-Bird, no hug for your Uncle Charlie? Later, Uncle Charlie. Hey Charlie, stay away from my daughter. (SOFT PIANO MUSIC) Whoa, okay. Geez. Haven't been here in so long. JEFF: Seriously, let's hope it doesn't fall down. Come on, slow poke. NADIA: Oh my gosh. (JEFF LAUGHS) On my own pace. Ya know, I remember it being bigger. Yeah, me, too. Poor George. After his wife died I told him to come over any time and he took me literally. (CHUCKLES) Every damn night for dinner I couldn't get rid of him. CHARLIE: So then ya turned around and lived in his house. He was my brother. CHARLIE: Hey, I'm blood, too. We're all blood. Except for Mrs. Jordan and Scott. Hey, I'm just here for Nadia. When Mona... To get Nadia's cut. Uncle George obviously hoped Mona would've turned up by now. Oh, for God's sake. If Mona hasn't shown up for all these years, I don't think she's gonna show up tonight. I agree with Katharine. It's been more than 10 years since Mona disappeared. I once believed she might have gone looking for her mother. I'm not so sure anymore. (SOMBER ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (KNUCKLES TAPPING) (DOOR RATTLES) Rima? Yes. STACEY: Come in. Mona was clinging to her mother from the moment I met her. George immediately fell for those sad eyes. Just a few errands and I'll be right back. Thank you so much for watching Mona. Her mother must have been crazy. I know money was tight for her. I think she was from Iran or something. George. - She's just a child. - Oh come on. (LIPS SMACKING) Thank you for the sandwich. (TONGUE CLICKS) (CLOCK TICKING) Dear Mr. Woods, I can not keep Mona. Please save her. And I would like to leave this necklace to her so she can remember her ancestors. RIMA: The history of the necklace is long to remember. It has been handed down for generations. I took it from my mother before I came to United States. (SOFT MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) But I must go back to my country now. No one knows about Mona back home. Having a child outside of marriage is punishable by death, so I must leave her with the people I trust. If I can ever leave my country, I will come back for her. Your mother left you with us for a little while, dear. It's okay, kiddo. It's okay. STACEY: George treated Mona like his own. Later we'll see these big picture windows in town. It's amazing, they look like polar bears. (SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) STACEY: He did the Christian thing, took her to church, guided her homework like a real father. - (MONA LAUGHS) - There you go, how's that? (MONA AND GEORGE LAUGHING) - Hm, maybe some more birds. - So what else do we need in there? Need a bird up in the tree maybe? Draw a bird up there. Maybe a nest, a bird's nest. Yeah, hm. Have some eggs in it. George was ready to send Mona to college, until Scott came along and took her away. (SOMBER PIANO MUSIC) Just leave me alone. I am so sick and tired of living in this old elephant house. I'm not even a kid anymore. I want my own life. You're too young to get married. Don't tell me what to do. You're not even my real father. I'm 18 years old, I can do what I want. I can live on my own. Mona! Back off, old freak. Mona, he's just after our money. (SCOFFS) Pathetic. Who cares about your money? Just let me go. (SOFT OMINOUS MUSIC) (GEORGE SCREAMS) Yeah, that's right. Uncle George once asked me to care of this business. Your cousin has hooked up with this person with less than a stellar past. Find out what you can about him. Where he lives, his job, friends, family. Get something on him, all right? Ya didn't know about that, did you? You are so full of shit, Charlie. Mona begged me to marry her. Well, truth be told, Mona was pregnant. (CHARLIE SNIFFING) Want some? (MONA SNIFFS) (SOMBER MUSIC) (CHARLIE CHUCKLES) So, you really like this Scott guy? I don't know, but I'm pregnant. You sure it's his? Ya know, I can help arrange an abortion. No, I want this child. I wanna know what being a mother is like. My mom abandoned me and Aunt Stacey never really liked me, so for me this is an experience, the connection to motherhood that I lost. One day she was gone. No one knew why or no one cared. Leave it. Trashing your paintings is not helping. I can do what I want. You can't anymore. You have a wife and a kid. Get a job and help out. Stop telling me what to do. All the time with your George imitation. Jesus, what is wrong with you? (OMINOUS MUSIC) - Mommy. - Thank you. Yeah, but I guess I'm mostly pissed at myself for not doing something to help her or even not being able to remember anything. Come on, Nadia, you were six years old. You know, I don't remember anything from when I was six. So, what's after school for you, huh? No idea. Travel maybe. I don't know, you? I was thinkin' mechanic. You know, Grandma's thinkin' college, but we'll see. Where do you wanna go? Escape to a land warm and enchanting. Paradise, I guess. Well then, you should probably check out New Zealand. It's a pretty cool and enchanting place. My parents took me when I was younger. So you remember it then. I remember thinking it was cool, but you know I don't really travel too much, so. Well, I've never been anywhere, so. Well, if you do go, I recommend you bring a camera. And I'm not talkin' about your phone. I'm talkin' about get one like professionals use. Ya know, a real camera. Those cameras are super expensive, Jeff. I know. But, you know, once I get my money I'll buy one for ya. No biggie. I'll remember that, cousin. The best money can buy. God, Charlie, I'm thankful Nadia turned out healthy. Nadia was the best thing to happen back then. Nadia was Mona's life, and she is so much like her mother. You are just plain creepy. What is it with you and my wife? Just a confidant when you weren't around. I always suspected you had somethin' to hide from me. Yeah, maybe I did. (CHUCKLES) You son of a... Calm down, Scott. There's no need for violence. The woman you're fighting over isn't even here. George and I realized we hadn't heard from Mona in a long time, so we decided to bring it up. Yeah, we all suddenly lost contact with her. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) At my request, my will is being read 10 years after my death with the hope that either, A, My daughter Mona has resurfaced, or B, her case has been solved. (LAUGHS) Sounds like Uncle George was expecting a miracle. If neither has occurred, please consult amongst yourselves at this time as to how to proceed. So you're all here now. Let's give it a shot. If the majority believes Mona is indeed dead, move on to envelope number two. If this is not the consensus, reconvene in 10 years hence for the continuation of this reading. (KATHARINE SCOFFS) (CHARLIE LAUGHS) There is no way I'm waiting another 10 years. I could be dead. STACEY: Oh. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Please make your decision considering Mr. Woods' precise instructions. Dead or alive? There ya go, Stacey, take a pen. I'm sorry, Jeff and Nadia, you have to be of legal age to participate. Okay. MR. PEARSON: Charlie. Randy. Katharine. So, what's your vote? Dead or alive? (CHUCKLES) One blank ballot and five believe she's dead. May I proceed? Yes, please. Now I'd like to take some time to fulfill Mr. Woods' assignment. Does it relate to the will? Certainly. Then let's continue. The ballot result doesn't surprise me. It strengthens my suspicion that each one of you is a murder suspect. Excuse me? I don't understand what you're saying. I mean all of you had a motive to kill Mona. That's ridiculous. This some kind of conspiracy? I'm completely lost. Randy, you know what he's takin' about? I'm out of here. Technically I'm not family anyway and I guess I never really... Please sit down, Mrs. Jordan. Yes you are part of this. As Mr. Woods' nurse, you tried every possible way to get close to Mr. Woods. You even wanted to divorce your husband so you could marry the old man. (KATHARINE LAUGHS) Wow, that's something I never heard. I knew it. But your idea was rejected and you blame Mona for it. You believed she was going to prevent you from getting closer to George. You know that's ridiculous. I never wanted to marry George. I was just his friend. Close friends, huh? Brenda, you asked me to keep it secret and I did, but I did it for George. I guess they all know about your affair now. Okay, I admit, yes. George and I were intimate, but that doesn't mean... That's not all, Mrs. Jordan. Mona asked you to take her necklace in for appraisal and you found the necklace quite worthy. And you came up with a malicious idea. Well, I've never considered it. Perhaps you were the murderer. Stacey, I thought you were on my side. That is brilliant perception, Mr. Pearson, good job. (STAMMERS) You know, you are a sick family. All of you have better motives than I do. You're right, Mrs. Jordan. Stacey could've benefited from getting rid of Mona. (SCOFFS) Nonsense. After your teaching license was suspended you decided to move in with Mr. Woods, and your plan was to manipulate him into changing his will before he died. My suspension was a setup. And yes, George was my brother and a widow many years. He needed someone to take care of him. I don't see the harm. There was a problem, Stacey. (SOFT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (MONA SNIFFS) You never considered Mona to be a part of your family because of her Middle Eastern heritage and you felt her behavior undermined the family's dignity. I don't understand why God gave me such wonderful abundance, a wife and a daughter, and he took them away. First Florence and now Mona. Florence was different. She's your wife. Mona isn't real family. You only had her for a short time. 13 years! What did I do with it? I worked and I worked. Years of drugs and constant worry. I don't mind telling you, on more than one occasion I wanted to get rid of her for you. Perhaps that is when you decided to take action. You're absolutely insane, Mr. Pearson. I'm sure George feels very disappointed in his grave. It's been more than five months. Mona probably just ran away again. Maybe she went looking for her mother. What if it's worse? What could be worse than this, George? Mona is just a mixed up kid. She only makes your life miserable. Oh stop it. (SOMBER ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (THUNDER RUMBLES) (RAIN PATTERING) So, you starved your brother and killed his adopted daughter? Oh, stop it, Charlie. It's not funny. (CHARLIE CHUCKLES) MR. PEARSON: Charlie, as a matter of fact, I can't prove your innocence in Mona's death either. I don't know what you're talkin' about, old man. Well, as the only offspring working in the Woods Corporation you had the opportunity to get close to Mona. I loved Mona. I adored her. Is this some kind of confession? Calm down, Scott, let me finish. Perhaps you did love Mona, but your appetite for money was greater than you appetite for love. For fuck's sake, who doesn't have an appetite for money? That's why we're all here. Yours was different. You controlled half of Mr. Woods' business and you were afraid Mona was gonna stand in the way of the other half after Mr. Woods died. You're just an appointed lawyer. I could file a lawsuit against you for professional misconduct. Yes you may. But my loyalty to serve Mr. Woods was based on his belief the inheritance should not be a celebration of what might be gained, rather a mediation of what was lost. So what's your point? My point is, you seduced Mona into drug addiction so she would become dependent on you. You tell him this? When that didn't work, you devised a plan to kill her by overdose. (CHARLIE CHUCKLES) Okay. So maybe I gave her drugs a couple of times, but only when she needed it. I never intentionally tried to overdose her, never. What, Charlie? Your drugs nearly killed her a couple of times. Shut up, bitch. I think you had a reason and opportunity to kill Mona as well. Me? Not a chance. I was a good friend to Mona. Charlie may not be wrong, Katharine. You proclaim yourself a good friend, but I'm not sure everyone would agree. Scott, you know, right? MR. PEARSON: I heard you and Mona fought hard over some issues. Scott, say somethin'. I mean, I fought for you, remember? She's cheating on me. What? She's fucking cheating on me and she's cheating on me with Charlie of all people. What? I know for a fact that she is. - He's goin'... - Okay, stop. Stay there, stay. Are you banging someone else? No. No wonder people call you a slut. I feel sorry for Uncle George takin' you in. Go back to where you belong, okay? A whore's daughter is a whore, too. Stop judging my family. I swear, I will make your life miserable as hell. I also heard a rumor about your royal wedding. You were engaged to an English duke, but the wedding was canceled because of a blackmail attempt to reveal your own infidelity. Charlie did that to me. I knew it. No, it wasn't me that blackmailed you. All I did was hire a private investigator for Mona. So Charlie, can you help me find a private investigator? Someone who can take really good photos? For what, keep an eye on hubby's pecker? Just dump him for fuck's sake. Guy doesn't even have a job. No, not him. Someone else. (SOFT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) That's a perfect motive. Well, Mona is a vengeful woman. I could totally see her tryin' to blackmail Katharine. I was really upset, but I never, not once, tried to kill her or anyone else. Well, Mr. Pearson, according to your little theory everyone could be the killer, but remember, the husband is always the prime suspect in a wife's murder. Of course, Charlie, I'm aware of that. Don't try to drag me into this, you son of a bitch. I was cleared and I'm still clear. And you, you're just a lawyer, not a cop. Don't try to wear boots that don't fit. I'm just tryin' to be fair about this, Scott, so let's see if this little investigation takes root. Whatever. But I'm innocent. Well, as a small time artist you just couldn't handle the fact that your work had been constantly rejected. (OMINOUS MUSIC) You're anger and frustration boiled over and eventually you became an abusive husband. Fuck you, Pearson! I don't have to stand here and listen to these false accusations. I already told you, there was someone else actually involved in her disappearance. You know who this guy is? No. Casper? Well that's kinda new to me. Have you all heard about this before? GROUP: No. (OMINOUS MUSIC) I think I killed my mother. I guess I got tired of being ignored by my mom. She always used to make me sit outside and wait or watch out for my dad. So why would your mother ask you to do such a thing? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) When the man came? What man? I don't remember exactly, but I was shocked by what I'd done. What are you doin' here, baby? (GUN FIRES) Did you drop the gun, Nadia? I have partial amnesia, so some of my memory is mixed up and lost. Sweetie, your daddy never had a gun, okay? Your brain is just a little messed up from being traumatized from losing your mother at such a young age. Ask your Uncle Randy, he's a psychologist. Your father may be right about this, Nadia. Children often alter the events of a traumatic experience to cope with the guilt and loss that they feel. They will even blame themselves... Oh my God, I'm so bored. Can we move on, please? Seriously, else I'm gonna quit. Yeah, me, too. I have to say that I am just very disappointed in all of this as well. They have a point, Mr. Pearson. Everyone has a motive, but that's not gonna make the will go away. What do you think, Doc? I don't think this guy is doing all this for Uncle George, but for his big fat ego. Hope you're not a part of his game. Of course not. Oh by the way, I can tell you who's Casper. Yup, oh, never mind. I meant the Casper from the Halloween party, not the kidnapper. (CHUCKLES) (NADIA GASPS) CHARLIE: What's going on? It's just this room. Look, there's light outside. Can someone please turn on the lights? - (WOMEN GASP) - Charlie. (OMINOUS MUSIC) He's been poisoned. Damn it. Come on, Charlie, get up. (CHARLIE LAUGHS) I just thought about that movie, Clue. Anybody see that one? RANDY: Drop it, Charlie. Ah. Mr. Pearson, if you're not going to read the will tonight I think we all should leave. I hope this wasn't George's idea. - Honestly. - Okay. Number two. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) To qualify as a beneficiary of my estate each person summoned must meet my Christian values by meeting the following three criteria. I knew George went to church and made his donations, but I never thought he upheld his values so strongly. One. Have reached the age of 18. Two. Upheld their sacred marriage vows. How can George insist on being faithful in marriage? He certainly wasn't. Only you would know that, Mrs. Jordan. Brenda, George was widowed at the time so technically you were the only one cheating. Guess I'm out. Yeah, don't worry, I don't think you were ever in. You've already got the cabin. What more do you want? SCOTT: Fuck, people. Let the damn lawyer finish. Three. Have no criminal record. Ho hoo. ♪ Another one bites the dust ♪ I wasn't actually prosecuted. It was a setup. I should have told George about it. Too late. Drunk driving is a silly thing. I mean, everyone does it. I don't think drunk driving's a crime. Yeah, I'm pretty sure attacking a cop the way you did is. Shut up, Charlie. I don't know why you always try to put me down. First you ruin my marriage - and now you... - I told you that wasn't me. Mr. Pearson, they'll argue all night if you let them. SCOTT: Yeah, just move on, Mr. Lawyer. If a beneficiary is deceased as of this reading the money will not pass off to their offspring. CHARLIE: Can't argue with that. To my son-in-law, Scott Winter. If Scott has remained unmarried and conforms to the aforementioned criteria, he will act as trustee of my entire estate to be held in trust for Nadia until her 18th birthday. Additional criteria will follow. GROUP: Everything? Oh, that is so uncool. I don't believe it. I don't think he will hold it for Nadia. He will if it's stipulated in the will. I'll contest this. That's the way the will was structured. Before we make any rash decisions, let's just read through the rest of the instructions. There's $20 million at stake, plus that mansion. We need to clear the air. Yes, we want this all up front, right? Let's see, if Scott had anything to do with Mona's disappearance he'd be out, too. For God's sake, people, that investigation was over 10 years ago. I mean, come on, why are we gonna bring up this crap right now? I told you, the police never found any evidence against me. Case closed. Well, George was very dissatisfied with that police investigation. Total incompetence. GEORGE: I need to see Detective Bechmann immediately. I'm right here, Mr. Woods. This is my new partner, Detective Thompson. Hey. Have you gotten anywhere, Detective? George, we've all but closed the case. Your daughter probably left of her own free will. Look at her husband again. It's been done. My son-in-law had motive and the means and had been abusive in the past. We've been over all this before, George, but without a body we can't press charges against your son-in-law or anyone else. At least go back out to the house and take another look. Maybe you missed something. We did our investigation. No body, no weapon, no sign of a struggle. And your daughter's history would suggest that another man... Follow him! Do something, damn it! We can't waste resources following every one of your disgraceful relatives, Mr. Woods. We'll let you know if something develops. Maybe I can go back out to the house and I can look around and see what I can find. Don't piss on my sidewalk, kid. I'm the lead here. Sorry, sir. Now, would you excuse us? And that's how you handle irate relatives. We call the shots, we're the law. You can't let these rich pricks bully you. What are you talking about, Stacey? The detectives literally showed up on my door on several occasions after Mona's disappearance. So you're saying it's been more than three months? Uh-huh. Have you heard anything since? No. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) It's clear. We'll be in touch. So, you reported your wife missing three months after she disappeared? I thought she would come back. I don't think that's a legit answer. Hey shut the fuck up. You're just trying to pin this on me because I'll have the inheritance. I told you that asshole she was shagging took your dear Mona, end of story. Let's say this Casper whoever ran off with your wife. Then why doesn't he show up tonight, hm? We're talkin' about winnin' the lottery here. Well, I don't know. Maybe that guy's already here. That guy could be you, Charlie. Me? Then why would I kill her? She's my ticket. Well it's like the lawyer said, you're greedy. You thought you would plunder Mr. Woods' entire estate. Unfortunately, the old man disappointed you. You're not foolin' me. I knew the old man better than anyone. I don't know about the rest of you, but the police never came to interview me. I know things, stuff you'd rather forget. Katharine, you might remember as well. Yeah, Mona swore us to secrecy, but I don't know what happened. I was never good at keeping secrets, but I did. (KNUCKLES TAPPING) (SOFT OMINOUS MUSIC) Mona? Are you all right? He has a gun. He said he's gonna kill me. But please just don't tell anyone. It'll only make things worse. I'm scared, but I'm more scared for Nadia. You can always go back to George, Mona. I know he'll accept you and he loves Nadia, too. I've hurt him so bad. I said I'd never go back for his money or go back and stay with him. Please, just leave. I don't know if you two are lying or if Mona dressed it up to sucker you guys. I told you, I never had a gun. But you reported your wife missing three months later. You had plenty of time to clean up and ditch the gun. I've said this, like, a trillion times. And for the trillionth time, there was no evidence against me. Hey, what's your take on this, Doc? Say somethin', will ya? I wish I could, but I barely spoke to Mona. Hey, don't try to drag Randy into this, you asshole. He's the one whose reputation matters. And again, we've gone too far discussing issues that are irrelevant. But we can't let Scott get away with this. There's too much at stake. We're getting nowhere. I suggest we all calm down. Everyone take a break. Go outside, have a drink, do something. Go, all of ya. I'll call ya back after 30 minutes. (SOFT OMINOUS MUSIC) Hey. Hey. I thought we were in alliance. All of a sudden we start going against each other because of that damn will? I mean, $20 million. What are you gonna do with that kind of money? I'll save it for Nadia. I'm just a trustee. (KATHARINE LAUGHS) Yeah, I suppose you got the last laugh. Remember I did you a big favor back then? I mean, I was the one who kept you in this will. Uncle George was diagnosed with lung cancer. He could die soon. What's that go to do with me? The old man overheard the rumors about you abusing Mona. He asked me to see if it was true. If my words reflect badly on you then, well, you're out of the will. Okay. So what am I supposed to do about it? (JAZZY PIANO MUSIC) I think I deserve some of your share. Well, George never ended up believing any of those accusations. (PLODDING ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (PARTY GUESTS CHATTERING) (BRIGHT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) KATHARINE: What's this guy doing? Yeah, that's great. (GUESTS CHATTERING) GUEST: Excuse me. (GUESTS CHATTERING) GUEST: Hey, babe. Yeah? (GUESTS CHATTERING) Hey, Katharine, let's have a talk. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Come on, Kat. I didn't blackmail you, you know it. Okay. I wish I could fix it. I don't give a damn. Do you understand why George let Scott be the trustee? I thought he didn't even like him. I don't know. I hope it wasn't Alzheimer's or something. I thought George was pretty aware before he died. (SIGHS) Yeah, me, too. (KNUCKLES TAPPING) Just come in. CHARLIE: Hey, buddy. Hey. (CHUCKLES) What can I say? I am so happy to see you after all these crazy years. Same here. So, you bring what I asked? Of course. Don't I always take care of your needs? Please, be my guest. All right. Let's see here. Smoke or snort? I enjoy snorting. (RANDY AND CHARLIE LAUGH) Thanks, Doc. RANDY: Mm-hm. And don't forget this guy. Ah, thank you. So, how is your wife? Oh, she's good. Her father has helped me get involved with politics. What's this all about? I am running for state senator next year. Good for you. (CHUCKLES) And I suppose you wanna snatch some cash for your campaign, huh? That's why I'm here. Yeah, too bad. I think that son of a bitch is gonna get all the money. (RANDY SCOFFS) RANDY: We'll see. You know, I don't know why Uncle George did this to us. I mean, he might not like me, but to give the money to that asshole? That shit was unexpected. I think Uncle George is setting someone up. What, us? Me? No. I can take care of myself. Ah. Come on, Randy, you took care of me when I was a kid. I gave you the inside scoop, you masterminded it, so how 'bout we take care of each other like the good old days, huh? Here, want some? No, no, I've had enough thrill for one day. (CHUCKLES) I know what ya mean. (SNIFFS) Hey, I, I got this plan. Hey, no, Charlie. We had our fun when we were kids, but I'm a doctor now, and soon to be elected official. The money will help, but I have to do everything legally. I have my reputation to protect. (LAUGHS) No, no. Randy, you're takin' this the wrong way. Everything I do is perfectly legal. Come here, pal. (SOFT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) - Hey. - Hey. So, looks like your dad's gonna get all that money for ya. I don't care. I'm sure my grandma's gonna be real pissed about that. Okay, you know, Nadia, you really shocked me when you said you thought you killed your mom. Not that I think you did. I mean, come on, you were six years old and way too small to handle a gun. I have this weird dream and I think that it might mean something. (SOFT OMINOUS MUSIC) (NADIA GASPS) And I think it might have something to do with the murder. Well, maybe your dream's tryin' to tell ya somethin'. Maybe, maybe you saw the murderer. Has anyone seen Charlie? He's probably hiding somewhere enjoying his blow. Yeah, whatever he snorted this time he's not gonna wake up any time soon. Why don't we just all move on and someone can explain it to him later. So, we all agree to continue? - Yes. - Absolutely. - Go ahead. - All right. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) In order to continue with the will, I have a small test for Nadia, my darling granddaughter. Her answer will determine whether or not her father, Scott Winter, earns my trust. What kind of twisted treasure hunt is this? That's the necklace I had appraised for Mona. I got a very good price from a friend, but she never sold it. STACEY: But Mona would've taken her family treasure with her. So what's this? Maybe she came back and left it with Uncle George? But then why deceive Nadia and everyone here? That would be a little unusual and unlikely. I understand, you all have opinions about the necklace, but may I continue the reading? - Yes, of course. - Sure. Nadia, come over here, please. Jeff, you, too. Nadia, my beloved granddaughter, here is my question. Is this your mother's necklace? What the hell is the old man doing? Scott, please let Nadia answer the question. Failure to comply will result in forfeiting your responsibilities as trustee. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doin', Doc? The question was for Nadia, not for you. No, this is not my mom's necklace. Are you sure? Yes, I saw my mom's necklace at home. GROUP: At home? At home? I don't believe this. George gave Mona that necklace for her 18th birthday. She loved that necklace dearly. (SOMBER ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) You said Mona ran away. Why would she leave her family legacy behind? You're wrong about this, Nadia. Your mother's necklace, it's not at home. She took all of the jewelry with her. I know, it looks identical. It reminds me of my grandpa and my mom so much. What are you doin' here, baby? Mommy, you're so beautiful. Thank you, my sweet baby. Mommy, can I wear your necklace sometime? Of course you can, but maybe when you get a little bit bigger, okay? NADIA: And my grandpa said the same thing to me. You must miss your mama, Nadia. I know I do. Uh-huh. I liked my mom's necklace, too, but she wouldn't let me wear it. You're a bit too young for jewelry, darlin'. You know that was a gift from your mother's mother. We'll get you one when you get older, okay? Nadia, if you said that the necklaces look identical, how can you be sure that this one isn't your mother's necklace? I just remember she left it at home. Are you sure about this, Nadia? Uh-huh. Yay, another ancient mystery. Stop it, Jeff. I feel totally dumbfounded. Just to be clear, you're certain this is not your mother's necklace? Yes, I think so. I do. Thank you. Okay, now we need everyone present to continue. Can someone please find Charlie and bring him back here? JEFF: Yeah, I'll go. Thank you, Jeff. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (KNUCKLES TAPPING) Charlie? Charlie wasn't in his room. I checked the other doors, too, but... Well, he needs to be present for us to continue, so let's find him, folks. (SOFT OMINOUS MUSIC) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (DOOR CREAKS) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (STACEY WHIMPERS) Stacey? Stacey, is that you, are you all right? Stacey? Dude. Uncle Charlie's ride is sweet. I know, who else in our family would drive a Porsche? Is it open? - Yeah. (CHUCKLES) - Let's get in. Get in. You know, if we can find the keys I can drive you around like Miss Daisy. Don't you think it's a little too late to go for a drive, Jeff? (BRENDA SCREAMING) JEFF: Give me the envelope. Go. Come on, go. - (BRENDA GASPS) - What happened? NADIA: (GASPS) Oh my God. (SOFT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Don't look at me. Uncle Randy, are they okay? No. They're both gone. (WOMEN GASP) No, no, no, she's still breathing. She's still alive. RANDY: Is she? Let's get her to a room, come on, quick. - (CLOCK CHIMES) - We need to call the police. Or an ambulance or something. There's no signal out here. How 'bout using the house phone? Oh, that's right, I disconnect the line during the off season. Somebody should just drive until they get a signal. No! No one leaves. Give me 10 minutes, I'll meet you all in the living room. What about my grandma? Stay with her, son. (SOMBER MUSIC) Hello, Scott. Hungry? What? Your daughter's answer caught my attention. It caught my attention, too, Doc. What are you tryin' to say? I think you had something to do with your wife's disappearance. (SCOTT CHUCKLES) Another accusation. Let's hear it. It's possible that you killed your wife, took her necklace, and stashed it at home. Why would I take the necklace if I had killed Mona? Because you didn't want her body identified. The necklace is unique. What if her body were discovered one day? Look, I know you're a psychologist, (RANDY GRUNTS) but your theory doesn't hold water, Doc. Mona's case was closed. Uh-huh, but a new case has been opened. What new case? Charlie may have found something on you, so you killed him. I didn't kill Charlie. Well. If you want to avoid being accused, you would need to shift the blame to others with stronger motive. Hey. Hey. NADIA: How's your grandma? At least she's still alive. NADIA: Mm-hm. Hey, do you mind if I ask you something? No, go ahead. JEFF: Okay, are you sure that that's not your mom's necklace? - I mean... - Well I just know it. Okay, but how? Because I saw my mom's necklace at home. Are you sure? Like, super sure? Yes, I'm positive. (SOFT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) It was that afternoon sometime after my mom went missing. Well, have you seen it lately? No. Okay, well then it's possible that your grandpa got the necklace, brought it back here and your answer would be wrong. I don't care. Maybe my dad felt disappointed. I don't care about the stupid inheritance. Charlie was obviously poisoned. That's all I can tell from a quick glance. I have seen cyanide do that in some of my suicide cases. Can you think of anyone who could have done this? Oh God. Stacey was a chemistry teacher, she'd know. Then why was she attacked? Maybe Charlie fought back before he died. Her background? Stacey was accused of being in possession of a controlled substance while she was a teacher. Charlie and his big mouth told everyone about that. The case against her was dropped. Well it doesn't matter. The damage was done. (DOOR CREAKS) (SOFT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (DOOR CREAKS) (JEFF GRUNTS) (FOOTSTEPS THUD) Well, if it wasn't Scott then, okay I'm not gonna lie. Katharine did it. She disappeared for no reason and she was gone for a really long time. Go on. Okay, well, Charlie wrecked her life. The poor thing's still unmarried. I'm sure she'll never get over that disappointment. How about Stacey? Well, maybe Katharine didn't do it alone. She relies on Stacey for a lot, you know. So you think they did it together? Well, Stacey could have come to help Katharine, but maybe Stacey was just a little too old to escape like Katharine. Man, my parents are so messed up. Yeah, mine were, too. Sometimes I'm glad they're gone just so I don't have to deal with it. I wonder why Uncle Charlie never got married. Maybe he knew it was more trouble than it's worth. You know, the funny thing is he's the only one that ever really talked to us. (BRIGHT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) I don't like my parents so much. They ignore me all the time. Me, too. But Uncle Charlie is nice. Uncle Charlie, can we see your photo? Hey guys. No, this is not for little people, but hey, how 'bout I take an instant picture of you two? JEFF AND NADIA: Yeah. CHARLIE: Okay. Say cheese. JEFF AND NADIA: Cheese. (CAMERA WHIRRING) Okay, now, you have to do this so the picture dries fast, okay? There ya go. Can I try it, Jeff? Hey you guys take turns, all right? You let Nadia have a turn. (PARTY GUESTS CHATTERING) There ya go. All right, hey kids, let's go inside, all right? It's gettin' a little chilly. Come on, let's go. (SOFT OMINOUS MUSIC) You seem to remember a lot. Yeah, his death must have jogged my memory or something. Maybe. Hey, do you still have the envelope from Uncle Charlie's car? Yeah. Do you think we should open it or give it to Mr. Pearson? (EXHALES) You're the detective. Maybe we should give it to Mr. Pearson. Come on, let's go. NADIA: Thank you. (ANIMAL HOWLING) Someone saw you and Charlie talking by the parking lot. What were you discussing? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) He was asking me about that Halloween party. Hey, Scott. You remember that Halloween party? What the hell's goin' on here? You're a coward, Scott. You've been ignoring her all this time. I'm not surprised what she's been doing behind your back. (SCOFFS) Oh yeah? Why are you so concerned about my wife, huh? What, are you tryin' to get yourself laid, you son of a bitch? Hey, okay, okay. All right, all right, okay. - Fuck you, Charlie. - No. - Fuck you, man. - Get off of me. Cool costume, - you fuckin' asshole. - I got you. - Fuck you, Charlie. - All right, all right. CHARLIE: Fuck you, your art sucks. I peed in your car's gas tank, - you son of a bitch. - Go paint a pictur. Fuck you. So you think your wife and Charlie were havin' an affair? I did, but I never got a chance to prove it. Anything else give cause for suspicion? (SOFT OMINOUS MUSIC) He phoned me before I came up here. Something about Mona's photo. I haven't seen anything yet. (LIGHT SWITCH CLICKS) Uncle Randy. What are you doin' in here? Hey guys. I just came to see if she was all right. Well is she okay? She should be fine. That's a relief. She's all I've got left. But she is almost 70 years old. You just never know. But I can stay and watch over her if you two wanna go out. Oh, that's okay, we'll stay here, but thanks, Uncle Randy. But Mr. Pearson does wanna speak with you both. Okay. I'll go first. Nadia can stay here. Charlie was a bleeping fucktard. He was up to no good. Stacey found out something and he tried to kill her. He was probably high at the time and ODed or somethin'. Anything else? (CHUCKLES) No, other than Charlie being bleeping fucktard? No. You can trust me, Nadia, I'm a psychologist. I've seen many cases like yours. Maybe I can help you get your memory back. Tell me, what did you see? I saw my mom's happy face and her finger over her lips. Mr. Pearson? MR. PEARSON: Yeah, come in, kid. Hey. How's your grandma? Oh, she's fine, she's fine. I left her with Nadia and Uncle Randy. Oh good, good. Look, I understand you and Nadia are not 18 yet. I don't see anything suspicious about you, but I gotta ask these... Well, I probably shouldn't have done this without permission, but I did. So there's somethin' you wanna talk about? Well, Nadia and I found this in Uncle Charlie's car. (SOFT OMINOUS MUSIC) And I also found this. So, you're telling me that your mother looked happier when this man came over? Can you describe him? I wish I could, but I don't remember. Right, right. Memory loss. But I have this weird dream. My mom hands me a toy Casper and says it's a secret between us. Maybe that's a message from your mother. She'd want you to keep her secret. It makes no difference. I don't even remember anyway. Here's the key to my car. Drive until you get a signal. What about my grandma? I'll take care of her, son, don't worry. I'll be back soon. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Why would you tell them that your mother's necklace is at home? I told them the truth. For God's sake, that is not the truth. We don't have your mom's necklace at home, sweetie. - But I saw it. - When? After Mom went missing. Then where is it? I don't know, I haven't checked it for a long time. See? I told you. You have problems remembering things. Your brain is just a little messed up, sweetie. No, not this time. Yeah, right. Dad? Did you kill Uncle Charlie? No, I didn't. Why do you think that I would kill Charlie? Why would you ask me something so stupid? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (OMINOUS MUSIC) I don't know why you called me back for more of this interrogation nonsense. What next, waterboarding? I told you all I know, Mr. P. Very well, Katharine. I think I have enough, thank you. If you don't mind, could you get Randy for me? I'd appreciate it. I thought we were done here. I told you everything I knew. I just wanna clarify a couple of things, Randy. So you think it was poison, right? Yes. And the more I think about it, the more I suspect it was Stacey. I've heard that accusation. I'm wondering what else made Stacey hate Charlie so much she eventually killed him. Charlie helped George run the business but he lost half the money. Stacey never forgave him for that. Besides, Charlie never paid her the proper respect. Okay, but why'd she wait so long to take action? Stacey is a cynical, but intelligent woman. I imagine she was waiting for the right opportunity. Today was that day. MR. PEARSON: I see. She probably underestimated the time it took for the poison to take effect and Charlie struck her hard as he went down. Any others that may be involved? No. Why? Curious. Well, I could put Scott into that hat, but he has his own terrible shit to deal with. And what do you mean by terrible shit? I just found out that Scott may have killed his wife in front of his own daughter. And how did you find that out? I just spoke with Nadia. (MR. PEARSON CHUCKLES) I respect your profession, Doctor, so tell me, what's your theory? It's a defense mechanism. Children often erase bad memories to protect themselves from the truth. I believe Nadia saw the killer and the most likely killer was Scott. JEFF: Grandma disappeared. (SOFT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (ANIMAL HOWLING) Hey Scott, where is everyone? Don't ask me. I'm not interested in your crazy family. And your daughter, Nadia? Interested in her? Why are you suddenly so concerned about my daughter? I was just speaking with her in Stacey's room and now both women have disappeared. Well, women like to play hide and seek, like my wife, ya know? Right. Hey, Scott, there's a friend of mine who's an art collector. She's interested in seeing some of your paintings. Maybe I can introduce you both some day. Forget it, Doc. I don't think your friends are gonna be interested in mingling with a mediocre artist like me. Oh, don't be so hard on yourself, Scott. You used to be a great artist. (SCOTT LAUGHS) Now that was a long time ago. Well, you can pursue your art again once you receive the inheritance. I just hope nothing turns up to spoil your future. What do you mean? Nadia saw you murder Mona. That's fucking insane! Nadia's suffering from post traumatic stress. She doesn't remember events clearly, but she remembers enough to make me suspicious of you. That's even more ridiculous. RANDY: Then there's always the necklace. All right, no more crap, Doc, got it? Well, maybe there is something I can do to help you. (CLOCK CHIMING) All right, folks, this is the last meeting before we return home. I never shoulda come here. I shoulda known better. Come on, Nadia, we're leaving. Your actions could be perceived as fleeing the scene of a crime, Scott. Not if I didn't do anything. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Unless you wanna be considered a prime suspect, I suggest all of you stay put. Now, everyone put your hands on your knees and leave them there. That's good. Now then, we need to straighten out this will before someone else ends up dead. I'm gonna read through Mr. Woods' will until we find the last qualified beneficiary. It's all about Scott and his family. You know what, I feel used. I feel used, too. At least I'm still alive. Before we finish the will, we should discuss Charlie's death. I think these two events are highly related. Just to remind everyone, this is the contingency for letter three. Where's Stacey? (SOFT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Nadia, my dear granddaughter, I know you have already given your answer. Now I want to tell you whether your answer is true or false is completely irrelevant, but I'd like to trace the necklace's journey and then you will know what I'm talking about. Years ago I found a fine jeweler to make a counterfeit, then I gave this copy to your mother for her 18th birthday. I believe your mother never found out that the necklace I gave to her was not her family's legacy but a replica. After your mother went missing, for a while I thought she would have gone with her fake family treasure. Mm, nicely done. But Nadia, you surprised me. I like my mom's necklace, too, but she wouldn't let me wear it. You're a bit too young for jewelry, darlin'. You know that was a gift from your mother's mother. We'll get you one when you get older, okay? But Grandpa, mama left the necklace at home. Can I wear it if she's never coming back? GEORGE: From that moment I began to think that your father must have killed your mother, because I believed your mother would never have left her family treasure behind. So I drew this 10 year will for two reasons. One, to validate my assumption about your father. Two, to give you time to grow strong and mature enough to bring justice down on the man who killed your mother. NADIA: Dad? Come on, Scott, your daughter saw you. Just let it go. God will accept your confession, Scott. (SNIFFS) Yes, I, yes, I did. I did. I killed Mona. But it was an accident. Nadia, what are you doin' out here? Mama told me to. That was the last day I saw my mom alive. Teriyaki chicken. Okay, I can make that for you. You let me know if you see your daddy's car coming, okay, baby? I guess I felt angry about this for a long time so I decided not to warn my mom. Come inside, baby, it's gettin' cold out here. (OMINOUS MUSIC) After my dad went into the house... Mona. (HAND BANGING) Mona, open the door! (HAND BANGING) Open it! (HAND BANGING) Mona, open this fucking door. (HAND BANGING) You dirty fucking slut, I know you have someone in there. Open this door! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) MONA: No. No (MUMBLES). No, please don't. - Get away from me, - No. you filthy cunt. (GUN FIRES) (NADIA GASPS) No. Mona? (SOMBER MUSIC) No, no. Mona? Mona? Mona? No, no, no, Mona, Mona. Breathe, breathe. Nadia. Nadia, it's okay, baby, she's gonna be okay, all right? I promise you she's gonna be okay. It was just an accident. Nadia. (CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Mona, Mona, breathe. Breathe. I was so scared. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) I guess I passed out on the street. The shock, the fear, the anger. It was too much. (MACHINE BEEPING) I woke up in the hospital the next day and I couldn't remember what happened. BRENDA: Oh, that's so sad. Nadia, I'm really sorry. Well. (SOFT OMINOUS MUSIC) It looks like I'm the last qualified trustee in this room. Don't spend the money yet, Randy, I'm not finished. Now it's time to talk about Charlie's death. Well, we already found the killer in the house. Dad, did you kill Uncle Charlie? No. No. Who then? That's a good question. For a while I considered the three women. Mr. Pearson, please, we've been through this haven't we? Mr. Pearson, Charlie threatened to tell my husband about the affair, but by that time my husband had already passed, so why would I even care? What about Stacey? Oh wait. I saw her put some mysterious powder in a drink. Another witness. Stacey was the prime suspect at the time of my interrogations, but this button made me change my mind. We found it near Charlie's dead body. I believe Charlie pulled it from the killer. Just because I'm missing a button does not make me a killer, Pearson. No wonder this pompous ass wanted to see me. Oh boy, I can't take another joke like this. No, it's not a joke. I must say, I felt surprised myself. Hey wait, wait, okay. We all wanna know how this played out, but you gotta tell us why you think Randy is the murderer. Well, during our first break I believe Randy killed Charlie, but he didn't have time to move the body from his room because I called you all back for the meeting. Hey Randy, time to go. (OMINOUS MUSIC) It was Jeff who found Randy's door locked, the only room that was locked. (KNUCKLES TAPPING) Charlie? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Charlie wasn't in his room. I checked the other doors, too, but... Well, he needs to be present for us to continue, so let's find him, folks. After I sent everyone to look for Charlie, Randy found his opportunity to dump the body into the storage room. (SOFT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (RANDY EXHALES) (GASPS) Oh, dear God. Oh. (CRIES OUT) Stacey? Stacey? Stacey? Stacey, are you in here? (BRENDA GASPS) (BRENDA SCREAMS) Oh, oh my God. (SCREAMS) That's a lie. Where's Stacey? I'm right here. Your head is injured. You don't remember clearly. It wasn't me, Stacey, you tripped over your own feet. I may be too old to remember a poem, but I'm young enough to remember who tried to murder me. Bastard! Oh no, oh no, don't you dare try to cover this up. We all saw you put the powder in that drink. You poisoned Charlie, didn't you? That was a sedative for myself. Oh, right. Okay. Okay, just because I am the next beneficiary you are all setting me up. But there is one small problem in your little game, you all have motives and I don't. That would be my conclusion, 'til I saw this picture. The camera log on the back of the picture says it was taken the same date and time as the Halloween party. Like the one Stacey took. (PLAYFUL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) You probably remember when the lights mysteriously went out? That's when somebody mentioned that notorious name Casper. Oh by the way, I can tell you who's Casper. (NADIA GASPS) It's been brought to my attention that you and Charlie had some kind of argument. Charlie asked me about the Casper thing. Tell me who Casper was at the party. Why do you even care? Just wanna know. You don't think he's Mona's Casper, do you? Why not? 'Cause Charlie, they're not the same person. Randy's a golden boy. I don't know who the heck Mona slept with. MR. PEARSON: And Scott's confession added more. He was asking me about that Halloween party. Hey, Scott, remember that Halloween party? Not really, why? Didn't Randy disappear for about an hour? Wait, I thought he got drunk and you drove him home. (CHARLIE GRUNTS) MR. PEARSON: Charlie didn't believe Randy and Casper were just a simple coincidence. Katharine said it all. I wasn't Mona's Casper. You can't accuse me just because I wore a Casper costume. You're right, I can't judge you by what you wore, but... (PARTY GUESTS CHATTERING) (PLAYFUL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (PARTY GUESTS CHATTERING) (PLAYFUL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (CAMERA CLICKING) (PARTY GUESTS CHATTERING) (PLAYFUL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Uncle Charlie, can we see your photo? Hey guys. (PARTY GUESTS CHATTERING) (PLAYFUL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) So, who is this guy? It's none of your business. I can't believe you took a picture of us. Are you insane? MR. PEARSON: Charlie wanted Randy to confess to the secret affair with Mona in order to tie Scott to Mona's murder, but Randy rejected him. (CHARLIE SNIFFS) Hey, I got this plan. Hey, no, Charlie. We had our fun when we were kids, but I'm a doctor now and soon to be elected official. The money will help but I have to do everything legally. I have my reputation to protect. No, no, no, Randy. You're takin' this the wrong way. Everything I do is perfectly legal. Come here, pal. Listen, Scott has been using his tired out Mona kidnapping story for way too long. The sooner everyone knows he killed Mona, the sooner he goes to jail. (RANDY GRUNTS) It's time to come clean, Randolph. You need to fess up to bein' Mona's boy toy. That way we'll kick the son of a bitch out of this game altogether. How'd you, How do you know that man was me? I used my expertise. All right. But how are you going to prove it? I got somethin' solid. Liar. Not this time. Then show me. Not 'til you say yes. And knock myself out of contention for the will? Uh, no. Get rid of Scott, and I'll split the estate 70/30 with you. Together. I get you, but if it gets out that I screwed my fucking cousin, (CHARLIE CHUCKLES) I'll be outta the race. You're fucking adopted cousin. I don't think my wife and in-laws would understand. (CHARLIE LAUGHS) Oh. Randy. (LAUGHS) Randy. I'm losing my patience, Randy. Be realistic. If you don't confess, I'll do it for you. You intimidate me? No, (CLICKS TONGUE) no. I advise you. Are you fuckin' crazy? Shh, I'm just putting you to sleep so you'll shut your fucking mouth. Welcome to my political campaign. (RANDY GRUNTING) (SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) KATHARINE: Hey Randy? Time to go. Well, did anyone actually call the police? I did. They're on their way. Katharine is right. You need evidence, Mr. Lawyer. You can't draw conclusions based on your crazy imagination. Well, my assumption is based on this. (SOFT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (RANDY CHUCKLES) This means nothing, you old fool. Charlie probably just wrote that to incriminate me in his little scheme. It's hardly evidence. I mean, the woman in the photo's definitely Mona, but the man, you can't see his face. He's turned away from the camera. Precisely. Again, thank you, Katharine. Now, I guess it's time to return to the will. Jeff? It's you in the photo, Randy, and I can prove it. Please, be my guest. And when you fail, I will gladly accept your humble apology. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) As Katharine stated, the man's turned away from the camera so we can't make out his face. But if you look in the right spot, there's a mirror. Of course the photo was way too small to actually see whose face it is. But if you were to simply download a magnifying glass app and use it on the photo, and if you zoom in, well, that looks like Randy to me. (KATHARINE GASPS) I don't believe this. Such a shame. You're Casper. RANDY: Scott. You're fucking Casper. You're fucking Casper. Jesus. (STACEY GASPS) (STACEY WHIMPERING) I swore that I would kill the man that she betrayed me for. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Scott. I'm sorry, Scott. (SCOTT LAUGHS) Sorry. You should be sorry, for the woman who died for you. You fuck, you fucking fuck! Fuck you, god damn you! Scott, you don't understand, there is more. No! You deserve to die. Fortune or death? I choose death. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Dad. (STACEY GASPS) (MEN GRUNTING) (GUN FIRES) (STACEY YELPS) (RANDY BREATHING RAGGEDLY) (SOMBER MUSIC) Dad. Oh Dad. I'm so sorry. (CRYING) Baby, baby, it's okay, it's okay. It's not your fault. Your mother, she's gone. She's gone, she's not coming back. She's never coming back. She's never coming back. It's over. (WOMEN GASP) (GUN FIRES) (NADIA WHIMPERS) (SCOTT GRUNTS) Nadia. (BIRDS CHIRPING) The necklace you tested is the original. Mr. Woods wanted it passed on to you as promised. (NADIA CRYING) Take it. (NADIA CRYING) (SIGHS) Hey Jeff, you wanna get in here and help me out for a sec? Yeah. Dude, do you ever hear from that foxy cousin of yours? What was her name? Lonnie, Lydia. Nadia. Why do you ask? I just saw on the news some girl went missing last night and it reminded me of your cousin getting all that money and disappearing. (SOMBER ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) NADIA: Hello, anybody home? Nadia. Where you been? I was in New Zealand, actually. It was beautiful just like you said. Did you take pictures? Well no. Someone didn't buy me a camera. Ooh, don't ask me now 'cause I'm broke and that's no joke. I figured as much. Here. Nadia, I don't know what to say. Grandpa George would say thanks, kiddo. Thanks. (SOFT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC)
