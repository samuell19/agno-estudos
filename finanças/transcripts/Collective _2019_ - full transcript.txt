On the 30th of October 2015 a fire breaks out during a concert in the Colectiv club in Bucharest. It instantly kills 27 young people and injures another 180. Outraged by the fact that the popular club was functioning without fire exits, people take to the streets against the corrupt authorities. Massive nationwide protests force the Social Democratic government to resign. To calm the people's fury a politically independent government of technocrats is appointed. It receives a one-year mandate, until the next general elections. 37 more burn victims die in hospitals during the four months after the Colectiv fire. I lost a loved one, Madalina. It is tragic and painful for all of us. Unfortunately, our health system... is rotten. How could people who escaped the fire... still die in hospitals 12 days later? Good afternoon. My son... On the 4th, the Vienna General Hospital agreed to take my son. They refused to sign... The Bucharest Hospital refused to sign off on his transfer. The hospital's management, that is. When he finally arrived in Vienna on the evening of the 7th... bacteria had infected his entire body. We asked why they foolishly delayed his transfer? And they answered, "A communication error". A communication error killed my son. My name is Laurentiu Istrate. I am the father of one of the young people... who died after 13 days of agony in a Bucharest hospital. The authorities lied to us, and failed to transfer them abroad... in time, where they could have been saved. Maybe not all of them would have lived. But surely we wouldn't have had another 37 die after the fire. I am Catalin Tolontan, from the Sports Gazette. The media and the public were told that authorities were managing the situation impeccably and providing the best medical care possible. - Did they tell you the same thing? - Yes. So you were as confident as we were? All hospitals gave the same standard answer. "We have everything we need. Your children are being treated better than in Germany." - Same as their public statement. - Yes. The same answer was given to us personally by the minister of health at that time. Fuck all your wicked corruption! It's been there since our inception But we couldn't see All the times we've felt so hollow As our hopes were hanged in gallows All this time we've been locked away And there was nothing left to say Until today! Cheers! To all of us! Thank you very much for being here tonight. Something's on fire here. That's not part of the show. Is there a fire extinguisher? Easy, easy! Get out! The Romanian government sends its condolences to the victims' families. Every effort is being made to save those who are hospitalized. At present, all medical needs are being met. I assure you that everything that could be done in Germany is being done here for all of them. Eighty to 90 patients are in severe or critical condition. We have all the conditions to provide the best medical care at European standards. COLLECTIVE The identity of our sources is sacred to us. - We wouldn't put anybody in danger. - Right. What can I tell you... they were all killed by various bacterial infections. The pyocyanic bacteria are the most aggressive. That's what they are hiding. - Hospital infections? - Yes. - So infections killed them? - Yes. Did bacteria cause deaths in other hospitals as well? Yes. Our hospitals are not safe for burn patients. Once infected with this, they don't stand a chance. - Really? - Within only 48 hours, one of my patients was infected with two different bacteria. If we remain silent we are complicit. As doctors you can't be forced to act against your conscience, right? Facts are facts, the burn patients were kept in a known septic environment and exposed to some of the most resistant hospital bacteria in Europe. That's a fact. Hospitals that could not treat severe burn patients were forced to do it and the doctors had to improvise on their treatment. Have you heard of any problems with the disinfectants used in hospitals? That they were of poor quality? Look! When he brings the next bag I'll move the car a bit. There's another one! Hexio-B. It's Hexio-B. I'll check labels to see which is which. - See, they have different labels. - One is black, one is white... - What is this? - This is the Hexi Pharma factory. - Our sources' workplace? - Yes. And they produce disinfectants for 350 hospitals? That's the place, yes. Go on. - We took a photo of this guy... - Skip that. - Were they carrying disinfectants? - Yes. They loaded them in this car. - Did you get the owner? - Yes, we waited for hours. - This is the owner's car. - A Porsche. - Okay. Is that him inside? - It's him. - A doctor. - Let's see his face. After we took the first photos I called the sources, "Is this the one?" They said it’s him. It's Dan Condrea. This is the guy. Okay. So here's the idea, a Romanian producer provides hospitals with disinfectants... that are diluted. Diluted to various degrees, depending on the product. What did your first source say exactly? That the disinfectants' active ingredients are diluted. - They don't match... - Is that the first thing he said? He showed me these production formulas and said "Take a look at the active ingredients. We use 60 kg for 600 kg of disinfectant. That's ten percent. Now, look at the label on the product. it says it contains 15 percent." Same for this one. Your source says the formula wasn't changed - even after the fire at Colectiv? - Yes, he said, "This isn't killing bacteria. It's killing people." The second source said the same, "I'm not a murderer. I have deaths on my conscience." That's why he left the company. How did Hexi Pharma advertise? One thousand clients, 2,000 operating rooms, 140,000 hands... - Two thousand operating rooms? - Yes. So, 2,000 operating rooms... are using diluted disinfectants. Could they be... so wicked as to feed us fake documents? I'll tell you what many readers will ask... "Take the products to a lab, have them tested." ICHECHIM LABORATORY ANALYSIS DEPARTMENT I can't comment. It's not my area of expertise... I understand, but it's frightening. ...to say if these disinfectants alone contributed... Well... - Should she sign for these results? - No. CHEMISTRY AND LIFE I just don't get it. How can they dilute it ten times? On the one hand I wanted it confirmed... Do you realize we've all been exposed, while in hospital? In the hospitals they dilute it again, maybe also use it improperly. That's the thing, they dilute it more than recommended. No wonder pyocyanic bacteria were found in the sterilization tanks. Now I get it. The surgeon thinks it takes 30 minutes to disinfect the scalpel, but the cleaned scalpels carry pyocyanic bacteria. Guys, we got them! Suprasept, for instance, is diluted ten times. These are the substances used in operating rooms. That's what the hospitals used for the Colectiv fire victims. St. John's Hospital, Pantelimon Hospital, the burn hospital, and where they were not used, Hexi Pharma donated them. The Romanian state failed to ensure the citizens' safety to the point where this madman, or murderer, was allowed to... - Our first thought was to run the test! - Exactly! It's the first thing that came to mind! Exactly, to see if what's on the label matches what's in the bottle. And the state didn't even think to verify it just once! To check on this madman, who got into every hospital. Just once, to check this stuff used by all hospitals! Let's split the pages. - Do you have a headache? - No. Let's call the minister of health. - It's almost 6:00 p.m. - Already? The Remorse of a Factory Employee Considering what we're about to publish, it's a problem if the minister won't comment. Hexi Pharma signed 796 contracts with various hospitals in the past nine years. Dear Minister, I am Catalin Tolontan, journalist. We need your statement on the discovery... The state didn't do anything. DISINFECTANT DILUTED TEN TIMES! We are back live. The Ministry of Health will begin to examine disinfectants used in hospitals, after the Sports Gazette's investigation revealed that two products used to disinfect operation rooms were diluted up to ten times. Biological bomb in Romanian hospitals. Disinfectants used in thousands of operating rooms are ineffective. The minister of health can't explain and has just begun investigating. I have ordered investigations by public health departments across the country. A total of 208 hospitals were controlled. Samples were taken from nightstands, headboards and hallways. Suspicion is directed at Hexi Pharma products after journalist Catalin Tolontan stated they were defective. When the fire started, the crowd ran towards the exit. Desperate to escape, people trampled on each other. Following the Colectiv fire, 64 people lost their lives. Next to me is journalist Catalin Tolontan, who investigated this tragedy that led to a change of government. I have this document... to show to the audience of the public television. This number here, 1.17 percent is the concentration of the active ingredient in the disinfectant. The label says it should contain 12 percent. It is diluted ten times. And we face the most dangerous hospital bacteria in Europe. Clearly, it was an institutional lie at state level propagated through all communication channels, that everything was done perfectly, that hospital conditions were ideal, "like in Germany". That was the statement, "like in Germany". We have blindly trusted the authorities. Myself included, as a journalist. I've said this many times, when the press bows down to the authorities, the authorities will mistreat the citizens. This always happens, worldwide, and it has happened to us. MINISTRY OF HEALTH Good afternoon, Minister. Good afternoon. Our main... Our main responsibility is the safety of our patients. It is our duty to investigate any suspected threat to our patients' safety. In this context, I will present the sanitation test results. We have tested surfaces, hands and objects to determine if the product was effective in destroying microorganisms. In over 95 percent of cases... it appeared they tested well. Less than five percent failed the test. Given the circumstances and the measures we've taken... I consider that our patients are in no danger at this moment. We still don't have an answer regarding the concentration of active ingredients in disinfectants. The investigation is ongoing. For people to feel safe, you should announce the measures taken in the hospitals where tests revealed problems. We took all the measures, according to the law. For what bacteria were the disinfectant tested? - Which bacteria get killed by them? - We don't test for bacteria. We test if anything grows after the disinfection. - Not "anything", sorry! - Here's a paper that says otherwise. Received today from the Bucharest Public Health Department. It says here that nine Bucharest hospitals conducted tests in their labs and only tested for four bacteria. The procedure was the following, hospitals staff made their own inspection. Let me be clear. These tests are objective and backed by evidence... - Still very subjective! - Maybe, but backed by evidence as all tests were done by accredited labs. These tests were conducted by the same people, suspected of professional misconduct. The people who purchased these disinfectants without any quality control. They and they alone are accredited to do this. Should we bring extra-terrestrials to run the tests, dear sir? Until proven guilty... I cannot make accusations against any company. I can't use as evidence tests that were done by unaccredited labs. - So it's a fake crisis? - Let's not call it a "crisis". Such a press campaign won't solve the problem. The disinfectants are effective in 95 percent of cases. For the remaining five percent I have ordered measures which will ensure our patients' safety. It doesn't match. The ICU death rate is at 90 percent because of hospital infections. Catalin Tolontan from the Sports Gazette speaking. You probably know why I'm calling. It's about the problems with biocides used in hospitals. Their dilution, and more. I know you discussed this with Intelligence Service agents. And they knew about it. If it's confidential, I'll respect that. A long time ago, yes. Around ten years ago, right? Do you remember how the Intelligence Service reacted to what you told them ten years ago? Several colleagues are working on it. We're doing our best. Yes, that's true. Thank you very much, Professor. Have a nice evening. Mirela! Did he admit it? There's this man... who's given the Intelligence Service dozens of briefings since 2008. Along with thousands of pages of documentation. He sent us a few dozen, and sent them thousands, over the years. He was contacted first by two agents... and later on by their pharma experts. At some point he had to tell them, "We've been talking for years and you never did anything." They told him that their reports got stuck somewhere. "Where?" They wouldn't tell him if inside or outside the Service. Even before publishing we wondered if the Service knew about it. This man was telling them for eight years that it's murder, that it kills people in hospitals. - Do you think people understand this? - Yes! If a loved one died or suffered from this, you'd go crazy. The story is so mind-blowing, I am afraid we'll look crazy. Why should we look crazy? I told them it was a disaster, it was killing people. Intelligence issued 100 briefings "including on hospital infections" Briefing sent to the Intelligence Service Intelligence Service knew about the diluted Hexi products and the rigged tender. It's fine. Let me send you one more thing. Healthcare for all! Not just for mobsters! Healthcare for all! Not just for mobsters! I AM THE 5% #CORRUPTIONKILLS Respect to the Romanian journalists who remained honest! Applause for the journalists who uncovered this story! Tolontan! Tolontan! Tolontan! Tolontan! Tolontan! Tolontan! The best investigations are made by a sports daily! That's the state of our press. - Indifference... - ...kills! Dilute corruption! Dilute corruption! Resign! Resign! Resign! Resign! The Intelligence Service confirms that between 2011-2016 they sent 115 briefings regarding hospital infections. The documents mentioned poor-quality disinfectants used in hospitals nationwide. The briefings were sent to the president, the prime minister, to health ministers... Following street protests and the tense healthcare situation, the prime minister called in the healthcare management and stated that healthcare is now the government's number one priority. We are waiting for the conclusions on today's meeting. State secretaries from the Ministry of Health and the defense minister arrived a short while ago. This morning I talked to Prime Minister Dacian Ciolos. Our different perspectives has led to my decision to resign. I am part of the healthcare system... and I want the system to improve. I have put all my good intentions into it. - Thank you. - Minister, no questions? Goodbye and good luck! This government had promised a dialogue! His problems were clear from the start. He was a hospital manager before he was minister. His actions and decisions as minister were contaminated by his memories as manager of a hospital that used Hexi Pharma products. That's not a crime as such, as they are used by 350 hospitals. The police have started investigations at three Hexi Pharma facilities. Dan Condrea, the owner of Hexi Pharma, came personally to open the doors for the police. Will you cooperate with the police? No comment? The offshore company is called Hatom Ltd. When I get the data from Cyprus, I'm sure I'll find him or his wife. Look here! Represented by Dan Alexandru Condrea. Fuck him! He can't hide that it's his. Fine. We also got hold of... - These are bank statements from Cyprus. - Yes, his bank statements. I know how to get more of these. - Do you also have cash withdrawals? - We have all we need. - Then you'd see the flow of money. - We have enough. We have evidence that he buys his ingredients at seven times the price. His offshore company buys at market price and sells the ingredients for seven times more to Hexi Pharma. - They overcharge Hexi. - Yes. And he moves money offshore and can use it for bribes. Classic offshore fraud scheme. Yes, the offshore company gets the big money. Black money he uses to bribe the health system, for business advantages. Speaking of bribes, we need to figure this out. Out of 100 epidemiologists, 80 were in his pocket! We are back live. Dan Alexandru Condrea, the owner of Hexi Pharma, arrived at the General Prosecutor's office. Did your company dilute the disinfectants? Dan Alexandru Condrea entering the Prosecutor's Office. A criminal investigation is underway regarding the probably diluted disinfectants used in Romanian hospitals. The investigation... Tests for Hexi Pharma disinfectants will be ready tomorrow. The government ran the tests at ICECHIM, the only specialized lab, which, however, is not accredited. Good afternoon. We will announce the first set of results. Discrepancies were noted between the declared concentration and the measured concentration. For instance, Glutaraldehyde measured 1.23 percent instead of the declared 12 percent. Iodine measured 7.41 percent instead of the declared ten percent concentration in active ingredients. This basically applies to all Hexi Pharma disinfectants. Please use the microphone. Catalin Tolontan from the Sports Gazette. How many of the tested disinfectants are diluted? All of them. - All are diluted? - Yes. Every tested product. - Again, all products are diluted? - Yes. Could you then explain the five percent announced last week by the minister of health? That's an entirely different topic, the five percent. - Look, I'm not an epidemiologist... - But you are a doctor. I'm asking you as a doctor, not as state secretary. Could 14 diluted products... possibly be 95 percent efficient, in sanitation tests? Sanitation tests reveal bacteria remaining on hands and surfaces that had been cleaned... - With Hexi Pharma! - No. - Oh, yes! - Will you let me finish? Cleaned with a disinfectant. So these 14 products that are all diluted, were found 95 percent efficient in sanitation tests. We ran chemical tests, not sanitation tests, and the results were bad. Any correlation with what happened before is as irrelevant as talking about previous tests. What were the risks for the patient if a surgeon's hands were disinfected with this product? If the active ingredient was supposed to be 25 percent but this test shows it's 0.01 percent. There is some risk but we don't operate without gloves. When you picked up the results, - how did you feel, as a doctor? - Let's not talk feelings here. How does a doctor react to this? We have stated our position without involving emotions. Thank you for your attention. Once we have new information or new decisions, we'll let you know. We hope the prosecutors will call to account those responsible. Starting with the diluted disinfectants. Our healthcare system is "diluting" public money into invisible pockets and they cover up for each other while patients are suffering. When moderating comments, remove "let's hang them" and "shoot them all" and such. If they say "it's genocide," no problem, but let's not incite violence, please! A lot of comments will be like "kill them, skin them alive!" This could be suicide or just a car crash that killed Condrea, the owner of Hexi Pharma. Murder is however not ruled out. Please, move back! - Move back and film from over there. - Is the investigation over? If not, why did you remove the car? It was difficult, as the body was disfigured. His ID was found in the car, but his wife had to identify the body. I don't know. We knew he was under surveillance. - I changed the title for the blog. - Okay. His ex-wife declared, "He wasn't the type to kill himself, rather the type to kill someone. If it's suicide, they pushed him." CONDREA DEAD! HIS SECRETS ARE OUR WOUNDS! Yes, Mirela. Everybody's gone crazy. They all believe the mafia state killed him. Why the hell was he still free? We're not the only ones, everyone's asking! They only had to nail Condrea to make him talk, get him to confess and demand a list of 50 accomplices... who he bribed within the health system. - And offer him a deal. - Exactly. Is there any source we haven't called, anyone who might know something? That's right, just squeeze it right underneath it. It will come through the leg, so... And just lift it up slightly. And open. Then rise up. - Yeah. - And that's it. You doing that? Yeah. So you can just move your thumb round. Position it. Yep. Keep it open. And don't... No, keep it open and relaxed. Okay. I'll let you move forward and just practice. Good girl. Good. Mom... Hello. That's it. My mom is crying. I was gonna say, it will be emotional for your mum to see. Good afternoon. I am Vlad. As of Friday afternoon, I am minister of health. Thank you for being here. I've known many of you for quite some time. From back when I was a patients' rights activist. I am now in charge of this system which undoubtedly needs improvement. To make it more truthful, more transparent and more solid, I'll need your support. I'll need allies. The first thing to do in order to regain trust is to stop lying. When will we see test results for other brands? We will perform sanitation tests on all disinfectants used in hospitals. The results will be made public immediately. Two weeks ago, the state secretary for health publicly promised to test the composition of other disinfectant brands. For Hexi Pharma, hospitals made their own sanitation tests and all results were good. And now you're starting sanitation tests again? The same inspection that failed before? Well... Some legal issues need to be clarified for the sanitation inspection to be truly relevant. In a few days, once this problem is solved, I will give you further details. "Germs spread in three ways as regards hospital infections. This one is personal hygiene and environment. Under Council of Europe recommendations, every three to four years, member states must report on the hospital infections situation." We have reported it, it was deplorable. The most deplorable in the EU? The estimated death toll is 12,000 per year. Just the reported ones. Many patients leave hospitals carrying the bacteria, but without symptoms. Want to read this? The lady is waiting outside for an answer. My goodness! Yes. Should she wait? Give me until tomorrow. Tolontan wrote... "On some questions, Minister I-am-Vlad simply screwed up." Don't mind him. I think tonight we don't have to mince words on this widely publicized topic, the biggest scandal of the past years. Let's also discuss the investigations of the health system. Hexi Pharma was no accident. In other words, could they have done it by themselves, alone? For instance, at the Municipal Hospital in Craiova, manager Alice Gavrila bought 180 litres of Suprasept at 28 Lei per litre and 1010 litres of the same disinfectant practically, six times more, at 38 Lei per litre. So when she buys more, the price goes up. We can't just ignore these facts. We're talking about a system. Do you think it was possible for Condrea to bribe... Not Condrea personally, the system he created. - Okay, his team, whatever. - Yes, it was possible. Was it possible to bribe 300 hospital managers? Managers and staff handling acquisitions. - More than 300 people? - Absolutely! - Why else is there panic now? - What panic? Panic in hospitals. Panic of hospital managers. You are always very vehement. Vehement and accusing. When the whole country becomes hysterical and people refuse to enter hospitals, afraid of infections, when someone commits suicide because of this intense context... - So you know why Condrea killed himself? - Sorry? - You know why Condrea killed himself? - I suppose he was depressed. Trying to place blame for a suicide, an act so intimately related to a person's inner state, that is hard to know... A press investigation has sent a man to his grave. No, it wasn't the investigation that killed him. This is a distorted interpretation of an act too painful and intimate to be judged by others. - If you are blaming us for his suicide... - I didn't. - You said the press investigation... - The pressure. Maybe he felt guilty for experimenting on 300 Romanian hospitals. The company has been doing this from the beginning, not for just two-three years. What they did has a name, it's called an experiment. In science, this is called an experiment. But it's done in a laboratory, not nationwide in 300 hospitals risking the lives of 3.8 million patients every year. Let's recap. All you write about the health system is terrifying. What's your goal? My son was my first critic, using almost the same words about my reports on the Colectiv tragedy. "Let the doctors do their job and don't disturb them - with such disclosures." - What did you answer your child? That it's my profession, however disturbing. Two months later, my own conclusion was that our silence during the first days after the fire allowed the authorities to lie to us. There is no final goal, I think, in this profession. All I'm trying is to give people, after this discussion tonight, more knowledge about the powers that shape our lives. If the prosecutor is investigating Hexi, why do we still have to test Hexi products? I have a clear answer, Hexi is still on the market. It's temporarily blocked in hospital storehouses... We still have Hexi Pharma products in hospitals. - But for a different reason. - Because we can't test them. - It's unacceptable! The state... - You're jumping to conclusions! They can't be withdrawn because by law only the company can withdraw the products but the company can't issue corrective invoices because the court blocked its bank accounts. Okay. Somehow, in this country... in any sane society, a harmful product gets withdrawn immediately. This is a harmful product! We should draft a law, if there isn't one. To indict someone, prosecutors must run their own tests. I don't care where, that's not the ministry's concern. - It's the prosecutor’s concern. - Exactly! Let's leave Hexi Pharma to the prosecutors. Let's stop dealing with them. The Ministry of Health should wait for a verdict. How can we legally prohibit... What's our solution for these biocides? - We don't know. - Ask Elena, ask Gabi! Should I give a solution? Neither you nor your advisors should provide solutions. Solutions should come from the ministry staff who are specialists in that domain and you can approve or reject them. There are a lot of biocides on the market that don't comply with European regulations. Whose job is it to take them off the market? Who approved them? Let's investigate it! Who approved them? Why? Who drafted the criteria for approving them? And shouldn't this committee have realized that it went wrong, and changed it? I'm not kidding. In writing. An official address to ask for an explanation. It should have been done a long time ago. Who was responsible for biocides? I mean it! Let's fire them all. Cut this part, the doctor's voice can be heard. - These maggots can be removed, right? - Of course! You filmed it one day after you heard about it. Burn patients should be bathed daily. It means he hadn't been bathed since... Doctor, have you sent this video to anyone else? No, to nobody. I realized, as I told you before... they know everything... and still do nothing. The minister of health... I don't know his reasons. What is the solution? I would shut down this hospital. There's pyocyanic infection, resistant to all antibiotics... and deaths caused by inaccurate blood transfusions. - Why wait longer? What could change? - And maggots! What can be changed? What else needs to happen for things to change? Aren't you afraid, Doctor? We won't disclose your identity, okay? Not only are people dying in ICU, they're dying covered in maggots. Maggots are growing on patients. Everyone is waiting to hear what the fuck you will do. How many will the ministry let die before doing something? This will be the question. The minister's press conference starts at 11:00. People are dying, everyone's expecting measures. We can only take radical measures. But radical measures aren't taken under pressure and in haste. Closing down the hospital is irresponsible! We must relocate the burns unit! The only reason that hospital still exists is the medical staff working there. And the fact that no other hospital can take in burn patients, you must say this. Yes, there are staff that know how to treat burn patients. Did the patient with the maggots die? I don't know, but we should find out. Sorry to bother you, who is the patient in the video? I understand he is not severely burned. Okay. I have to hang up now. Thank you very much. That man died, actually. Last night. Let me begin by expressing my deepest regret... for the burn hospital patient's case. This press conference is about the burn hospital. That hospital is in a serious state... and not just since recently. The situation has been known at least since the Colectiv fire. But nothing has been done to improve it. Leaving aside severe management failures the only reasonable solution... is to relocate the hospital. Minister, it seems medical procedures were not followed. If patients had maggots, no one cleaned or disinfected their burns. Aren't the medical staff responsible for the patients? Maggots don't grow suddenly, or in an hour... I can only agree with you. But I want to point out that we cannot blame the entire staff. This is the only hospital with specialized personnel - for severe burns. - If there's an explosion now, where would the victims be treated? Abroad. We lack the capacity, even five burn patients would be a serious problem for our country. And this is unacceptable. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. I honestly had the feeling that you knew what was going on and weren't going to do anything. You know? Yes, the level of trust is very low on all sides. Of course it is. Also, when you gave Tolontan that video, that wasn't the normal thing to do. I understand perfectly, because for years, for decades, things have been covered up. So, I understand, but it's not the normal thing to do. When I complained to the hospital manager, he responded in writing that complaints should be addressed to my direct boss. That is, to the head of department who, after the Colectiv fire, declared that we had the best medical conditions. While our patients were dying away. As they are now. The last victim in our hospital, Boghian Roxana... who survived till December, the poor girl, had pyocyanic bacteria even in her ears. - A Colectiv patient? - Yes. Even in her ears. She only had burns on ten-15 percent of her body. She surely didn't die of airway burns. You know, they cover patients' faces with sheets. To not have to see them. I went in and asked, "What are you doing? They're not dead! How dare you cover their faces?" They folded a piece of sheet and covered their faces. They wake up, they open their eyes onto a sheet! This is the situation, and they just don't care. Doctors bribe their superiors to be assigned to... - What, they bribe... - Doctors bribe the head of surgery in order to be assigned to the operating rooms where patients give more bribes to the doctors. Got it? How the hell can all this be solved? How did hospitals get so bad? And doctors? It's their humanity, after all. Well, as my mother put it, we're no longer human. We doctors, we're no longer human beings. We only care about money. Uncover this one. How is your life after the Colectiv fire? I am working with an NGO, I am trying to divide my effort between my own recovery and helping out others. Do you hold a grudge for what happened? No, I am not able to hold a grudge. Where do you find the strength to go on when you look in the mirror and know that someone is guilty, and you didn't deserve this? I have no choice, the only way is forward, and up. It can't be that simple. Tedy was burned much more than my son. How can this be? - I'm so glad you came! - How could I have missed it? I have your number now. Pleased to meet you. I haven't met you yet. - How hard can I hug you? - Pretty hard, I'm strong. - So happy to meet you. - Same here. Wow, how cool is that? Brothers, thank you very much for being here. I wanted to... I felt the need to let you know what we've been doing. First of all, for those of you who still need specialized treatment abroad, the Ministry of Health has the funds... and we've allocated money for the next two years. Also... at the burn hospital... the intensive care unit, which treats severe burns, was completely renovated. It was stripped down, and should now meet the standards. Instead of 12 beds there are now only six. Each patient will be in a private room, more isolated, and hopefully treated better. Why did the minister of health at that time send so many patients there? We were packed in the burns ward. I shared a bed with another patient. How could they put so many severe cases in such an inappropriate location? That minister's statement, "We have everything we need", was unheard of. No city in Europe could handle so many burn patients. They should be taken to intensive care, and then transferred quickly to specialized burn centers. Again, I want to understand how it was possible for state authorities, knowing already what you know now, how could the state, through the minister of health, do such a thing? What is the state's position today on what the same state did last year? It was a political decision. The political decision was not to pay for your medical treatment abroad. And the transfers were delayed because hospital managers didn't issue the transfer papers. No new manager will be hired in any hospital until we have drafted a new manager contract that will clearly state the managers' duties. - Is that your message? - Yes, and they'll hate me. I want to know what to tell the press. How can we put it elegantly? "The entire selection procedure is rotten to the core." Maybe we should say just that. How about "Taking note of the deficient hospital management, and its outcome at the burn unit... Minister Vlad Voiculescu has decided to postpone further calls for managers until the selection procedure is revised and a new management contract is drafted." That having been said, the minister has decided that there will be no call for managers until the completion of the changes, in the time frame of a few weeks. The problem is the corruption of the managers of big hospitals. That's 14 hospitals with enormous budgets. That's our Gordian knot, it's the place to start. The members of a hospitals' administration board lack any expertise in hospital management and are appointed politically. Now, as they organize the selection, the manager will be... Eliminating political influences is impossible. Therefore, the board should include two outsiders, people from outside the system. Romania totally lacks human resources for hospital managers. That's because our public health management school is incompetent, corrupt to the core, and issues countless management certificates to people who send bribes and get their certificate by mail. This will be like teaching a pig to dance. We should have reasonable expectations. The idea is that the pig shouldn't be the only candidate. We should create a framework to allow any manager, for instance from a French hospital, to enter the contest and prove their expertise according to the law. Idiot! I'm the manager here! Fuck you! I gave you your job, you brainless fuck! Cunt, fix these contracts now! Got it? - Get the fuck out of here! - I'm not going anywhere. Don't feel like doing this? Then fuck off, all of you! We have this case, it's really something! The sources would like to bring in documents. Two ladies from the accounting department of a Bucharest hospital. - Wow, what an ugly house! - Built with the hospital's money. - Which hospital? - Malaxa. Dude, is he really a university professor? Professor Secureanu. Wanna hear how he talks to the staff? Stop this shit or fuck off! Fuck you, I'm the manager. Stupid cunt, I gave you your job. Two cars, look. I think that's him. No, it's not stopping. The Benz is stopping here. Come on, Mr. Secureanu. That's him. That's the guy, bro. Look at the face on this guy. Bloody hell, this guy is a hospital manager. This is a list of all suppliers since this manager first came to Malaxa. Suppliers and costs. This is very important. I marked the dubious ones, who issue fake invoices used to steal funds. He'd just put an invoice on your desk and say "take care of it"? Yes. "Pay it, urgently!" All payment deadlines were for the next day. Oprescu, the former mayor, has built one quarter of his clinic with our money. - Which clinic? - His clinic in Switzerland. The clinic is there, it's functional. Built at Swiss standards and all. That clinic is generating income. How did the former mayor get the money from your hospital? Through the president of the board? No, those were bribes. It was done through Alex Ltd... through Alsa and through Farmvil. These companies belong to the former mayor. Okay. Did you ever estimate how much hospital money has been stolen? - This is what I meant to tell you. - For that money we could have built a modern, fully equipped hospital with state-of-the-art technology. I know what I'm talking about, because I processed these fake invoices. Are we talking... millions? Millions of euros. Tens of millions of euros. Last December, after the tragedy with those kids at Colectiv, they stole so much money. - How so? - They poured money down the drain! Down the drain! Three-year-old acquisition lists, that no one gave a shit about... were all approved in December. And we bought every single item with no control mechanism, first come first served. I feel very guilty about what's going on. - You understand what I mean. - We understand. So your plan is to take this to the prosecutors? Yes. - This is still on? - Yes, of course! And you still want us to first run the story, so it can't be covered up? Yes, definitely. - Nothing can change our mind. - Great. Then, the moment we run the story, you walk into the Anticorruption Directorate. The election campaign has officially started. On 11 December we will elect a new Parliament. For the first time, diaspora Romanians can vote by mail. Mobsters don't care about context. They're mobsters. To someone who did this, does it even matter who calls to ask them to remain silent? Did he have a plan for when it falls apart? Does he have a plan B? Does he have a bag prepared, like in the movies, to pack his gold bars and to flee? - Does he have a plan B? - We'll see. Anticorruption prosecutors stated that manager Secureanu has stolen hospital funds in 1075 cases. The story was published by journalist Catalin Tolontan and prosecutors have already started investigating. Any moment now, Manager Secureanu should leave the Anticorruption Directorate. That's him. - Is it your turn to pay, Mr. Secureanu? - Did you steal hospital money? Is this your success story? Open the door! Secureanu, handcuffed, leaving the Anticorruption Directorate. Tomorrow we will pass the emergency bill regarding hospital managers. I am not claiming to have reformed Romanian hospital management but it's a first step. The reason we didn't do this earlier is that we tried to negotiate with those involved in order to not end up with a major conflict. Moreover, I was repeatedly blocked by all institutions that had to approve it. Most recently by our distinguished Academy. It's no secret that they will try to stop it by all means, the bill was already leaked to their populist news channel. Yes, they said I wanted to exclude... Yes, exactly. Whatever they throw at me, I'll take as a compliment. I will explain why this government wants new hospital managers. They plan to bring in foreign companies to take over the Romanian hospitals. Foreigners will take our profits to develop their health system, while we are stuck with these hospitals, which they would actually like to close down. ANTICORRUPTION DIRECTORATE Hospital employees would love to blow the whistle but the health system lacks a proper control mechanism. All we can do is have Mr. Dina, from our control body, gather post-factum information in hospitals. Or, if there are indications, he can follow up. The problem is extremely serious. From people within the health system I learned that the Malaxa fraud was no secret, everyone knew. And also, that the manager has friends in high places, including politicians that make our health policies. Half of the hospitals, in Bucharest and nationwide, are managed in the same way. - They are just less outspoken. - Yes, we know. Those who reported him were fed up with his insults and threats. It's not like they were fed up with the fraud. These managers have always been untouchable. - They think this can never change. - It's the same in other areas, no one ever touched the crooks, and now they panic. As soon as we investigate one of these managers... our phones start ringing. We get summoned by the Parliament Committee for Investigation of Abuses and get complaints that we violate the managers' rights. We want to launch this before elections. To sign an agreement for investigations on the health system. The cases should end up on your desks and perhaps it could give it a better image. On the other hand, it might help deter others from demolishing what we are building now. That's our plan. An emergency bill introduced changes to the hospital management contract. I invite Minister Vlad Voiculescu to give you further details. Most of the changes approved by the government today are designed to solve problems identified by the ministry's control body. Not just irregularities, but problems that have been affecting us all for years, nepotism, politicization, conflicts of interests. For a hospital manager, only the patient's interests should count. Therefore, starting today, hospital managers can no longer hold leading or administrative positions in any political party. We don't want hospitals to be managed by political interests. We've had enough of that during the past 25 years. And as we all know, our party leaders always choose hospitals abroad for their own treatments. Thank you, Minister. Any questions? Why are no lung transplants performed in Romania? I will gladly give you the details on another occasion. Sorry, but last month a patient died waiting for a transplant. Your answer is needed urgently... Fine. ...it can't wait. We cover lung transplants for dozens of patients at the Vienna General Hospital, where they have proper infrastructure and expertise. For €120,000, while in Romania it would cost 90,000, according to the manager of St. Mary's Hospital. Shouldn't you speed things up considering that patients on the waiting list are dying? It is very simple. I have a responsibility... Yes, indeed... My responsibility is to ask the right questions and to make informed decisions. And if you don't have the answers? I find it alarming that a minister claims a hospital can't provide proper care, although the manager stated that the hospital is fully authorized by the National Transplant Agency. It is unacceptable when we have a hospital fully equipped for transplants and specialized doctors. How many people lost their chance to live because of whatever suspicions? This is a serious problem! To not allow transplants in Romania and send patients somewhere abroad, to Vienna. Going abroad seems to be the latest cure, when the same care could be provided in Romania, for less money. Did you mention our suspicions about the accreditation? - I had to. - That's fine. The head of the Transplant Agency admitted in here that he was forced to accredit St. Mary's Hospital. He repeated it in my office. Suspicions are raised once the head of the Transplant Agency said that. Moving on, we drafted the control order. The control will establish if the standards for transplant surgery are met. As the transplant scandal continues, the manager of St. Mary's Hospital has filed a criminal complaint against the minister of health. Vlad Voiculescu refuses to fund transplants, as the hospital was accredited without having met the necessary requirements. Since the hospital is under the mayor's authority, Bucharest mayor Gabriela Firea responds with an urgent request. As general mayor and as a citizen of this country, I demand that the minister of health give the green light for lung transplants. Surgery must begin tomorrow morning! Let's have a press conference at 6:00 p.m. I want to announce the following... I have major doubts about the accreditation of St. Mary's Hospital. I have clear information it was done under political pressure. I think that the pressure from Mayor Firea is outrageous. Because lives are at risk. I find it totally irresponsible that the Social Democrats are pushing for this. Good evening, Professor. Please hold for the minister. Hold on. - Good evening, Professor. - Good evening, Minister. Look, as the attacks continue, I have to go public with an answer. I will say what you have told me and I wanted to discuss how to phrase it. I would say that I have information... that the head of the Transplant Agency was forced to sign the accreditation. If I may, Minister, this could have legal consequences. That I signed under duress. Just a quick mention. Nothing bad has happened yet. It's a problem that it was accredited, but there are no effects. No transplant was done, nobody died. No, but it will destroy our agency's credibility. They will say the agency is under political influence and it won't look good to the patients. All the hopeful patients who think the agency is working in their interest... - That's not a good thing, Minister. - But it's the truth, isn't it? It is, but I can't prove it. - I just gave you some inside information. - That's not true. When asked by the Ministry if the pneumology unit should be accredited you answered that the unit was not ready and it should be evaluated more thoroughly. If I admit it, they will say the agency is gambling with accreditations. We can't afford a scandal. We would have to withdraw the accreditation. But that is my point. If the unit met all standards, we maintain the accreditation. If it wasn't done by the book, we'll obviously withdraw it. This is obvious to me. If they don't meet all standards, we must clearly... Please don't go public with this. It could have legal consequences. - I'll discuss it with my team. - Please! I can't promise, but I'll consider it. Thank you very much! - Will you have the press conference now? - Yes, now. It's here at the ministry, I am already late. Okay, thank you. Have a good evening. The great Professor... just pissed his pants. Let's write. - Okay. - St. Mary's Clinical Hospital... Can't provide proper care after a transplant because the hospital doesn't have a pneumology unit, which is vital and mandatory for postoperative care. - Ready? - Yes. Start recording. We have serious suspicions that St. Mary's Hospital was accredited under political pressure. Attacks coming from one side of the political spectrum indicate which political party is behind it. After it was accredited, the hospital found it cannot provide postoperative care for transplant patients as the hospital has no pneumology unit. This unit is essential and mandatory for post-surgery care. We decided not to begin transplants at this hospital in the patients' best interests, not against it. Do you think the Transplant Agency issued the accreditation illegally? Okay. Look, it's not my job to give legal or medical verdicts. As long as the requirements are not met, we can't make such political propaganda, "Wouldn't it be nice to perform lung transplants in Romania." We are talking about people's lives and a tragedy can occur at any time. It's that simple. Do you need help with this? If it has sugar it's perfect. - One or two? - One, please. Not sure how I should say this... The way a state functions can crush people sometimes. You all got the full blow of a dysfunctional state, its corruption and its health system. And I've learned, since I've been here... that it's not just the minister who sets the tone. Everything underneath is rotten. It's rotten. 90 percent of everything in this ministry is deeply... - Outdated? - To say the least. It's profoundly corrupt, demotivated... They don't give a fuck about anything out there. That's why we're terrified of what these elections might bring. If people don't go and vote, the Social Democrats will win a majority and together with other retrograde parties... they will try to turn things around, to how it was before. Because that's the world they can own. And given political developments worldwide... Look, "Mayor Firea at war with the technocrats." The minister must approve the funding for lung transplants that we need to make in Romania, in Bucharest, at St. Mary's Hospital. Instead, he takes the lungs, not personally, but through employees, and sends the Romanian lungs abroad. These lungs were not good for Romanian patients on the transplant waiting list. He exports them to Vienna, where he used to work. Tell me, we have an accredited hospital, up to European standards, we invested millions of euros, but a minister who worked in Austria sends all the lungs and patients to Austria! I think Romanians can draw their own conclusions. Election day. Around 19 million Romanians are expected at the polls until 9:00 p.m. As usual, politicians were among the first voters. Hi, Mom! - Thank you. - Thank you. Have a nice day. By the end of the day we will know where Romania is headed. This will depend on everyone's vote, and on the turnout. After six months at the Ministry of Health... I can say that with courage, and with the right people, things can change. I believe... Everybody should vote. Brothers, go vote! Hundreds of patients voted from their hospital beds. An extra reason for you to vote. Even patients fresh out of surgery wanted to participate. Only five percent of voters aged between 18 and 24 went to vote. Of those aged between 28 and 34, ten percent went to vote. With 99 percent of votes counted, the situation is very clear, the Social Democratic Party has won the election. They won in 34 counties, almost everywhere. For the first time, they won the majority in Transylvania and even in Brasov. Here is the platform that won these elections for the Social Democrats with an unprecedented majority, zero tax for doctors and for those working in IT, regardless of income. The 16 percent general income tax will go down to ten percent. - Hello. - Hi, Dad! What's up? I had low expectations, but the results are crushing! This is something... The Social Democrats... This is their biggest majority in history! How can this be, Son? Good question! It's like we are living in separate worlds! Those who comment online are a minority, - only ten-20 percent! - Yes, the ten-15 percent. What are you still doing here? This country won't wake up 30 years from now! History tells us it takes more than decades. They are hopeless! This won't change in five-ten years. By the time you'll retire, it will still be the same! Move back to Vienna! I am serious! You're working in vain! From there at least you can help sick people, people in need. Here, to try and wake up the people. It's heart-breaking! Bye, Dad! I am wondering... if any of the measures I took will last. Fuck! Come on already, Mirela! There's a lot more work waiting. For fuck's sake! Please tell him. It's important! Tell him, let him hear it. About Secureanu? - About the warning we got. - I was approached by someone from within the intelligence services. That we should now be more careful, for our families. - The message was off the record. - Off the record. That we came across... What did he call it? "You came across a nest of unscrupulous mobsters." We don't know who they are, which ones could be the unscrupulous mobsters. Secureanu is one for sure. Freemasons, secret agents, intelligence, who knows... Pseudo-agents... Who are dumb enough... to try and hurt us through our families. Anyway... big money... maybe the former mayor and his gang? Okay, here's today's story. Mayor Firea just appointed a Social Democrat manager, who isn't legally allowed to manage a hospital, in charge of 19 hospitals with a total budget of 230 million euros. Yes? Happy holidays! - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! May you be healthy and happy together. Enjoy that wonderful girl of yours. Thank you! Same to you! - How are you? - We're on our way to the cemetery. I see... Okay, then, Narcis. God bless. Take care, bye. Someone's at his grave. Don't cry, Mother. Cheers, Son. That's his. You know this song.
