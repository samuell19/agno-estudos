- You picked the wrong house, you son of a bitch. What were you gonna do? Rape my wife? I should damn well kill you. It's within my rights. Answer me boy. - It's ringing. - Uh, hello. Yeah, yeah, give me the sheriff's office. Now you're in for it. - I think there's something wrong with him. - Yeah Sheriff, this is Kyle Petis over on Waverly Street. I just caught some kid breaking into my house. Oh no, he ain't goin' anywhere. - So do you understand those rights as I've read them to you? Hello? Hey, you're gonna need to acknowledge me, son. Okay, ain't making it any easier on yourself. Come on. Inside. Watch your head. Turn around. Feet. I wouldn't worry about it, Kyle. I don't think he was looking to hurt you or your wife. - I don't know, he looked like a damn pervert to me. - Okay. Oh, the sheriff's here. Come on. - Nice to see you, Frank. - Sheriff. - Hi, Kyle how are you? Always a pleasure, Mrs. Petis. How are you feelin' these days? - Not good. - Not so good? Well, we'll see what happens with that. Hey Frank, what seems to be the story? - From the looks of it, he was just looking for some clothes and food. Prescription pills, probably. - Okay. I tell you this though, it looks like he's been to some party. - Yeah. - Frank, you look after Mr. And Mrs Petis. I'm gonna have a word with the boy, okay? Nice to see you, Mrs. Petis. Good luck. - Okay. - Okay, I just want you to know that I'm here to help you, okay son? What's your name? Well, it seems to me that you're already in a little bit of trouble. We can make this easy so I'm gonna ask you again, what's you're name son? Okay. I'm just gonna take a little look at you, okay? Nice and easy. I'm just gonna lift your head. Nice and easy, okay son? Give me a look at you. Jesus. Frank. Frank. Get the cuffs off the guy right now. - What? - Get the cuffs off him right now, get him a blanket. We're the same age, you know that? You're kiddin'. - I'm not kidding, Frank. - What happened to you? - It's not that funny, Jim. - It's not the years, it's the mileage, right? - Yeah, I hear ya. I'd say wake me, shake me if I wasn't already, Frank. - What are you sayin'? - That's Aaron Porter. Yeah, that's right. You remember Aaron? That's my wife's brother. We left for the Gulf about 20 years ago together. - I ain't buyin' it. - You okay? Aaron, I'm real sorry we had to bring you here, man. We just kind of had to make sure. Listen to me, I've got a spare bedroom back at the house and you're coming home with me today. I'm taking you home. Jesus. Where the hell have you been all these years, man? Where ya been? It's okay, man. It's okay, we'll have plenty of time to talk about that. I'm sorry. For now let's just get you home. Get you sorted. Come on, come on. Come on, man I've got ya. Come on. I've got ya. Let's get you home. - So after all this time, you decide to talk to me about Aaron and this is what you come up with? He's alive? - No, it's not like that. Okay, just go with me on this. - What are you doing, David? - I know there's a lot of things that I haven't shared with you. - My brother is dead, David. My brother's dead. - Just go with me on this. - Aaron? How? Oh God. - It's okay, it's okay. It's Okay. - Let me touch him. Aaron. - Ugh, you eat like a pig. - Erin. Sweetheart, that's not polite. Oh. - Okay. It's okay. Plenty more where that came from, right? Since you've made room, here you go, Aaron. Enjoy. - Aaron, I just, I don't understand. It's been 20 years. Where have you been? - He hasn't aged a day in those 20 years either, has he? - What's wrong, can't talk? - You know, maybe we should take him to see a doctor and get him checked out? - You better talk or else they're gonna make you go to the doctor. - What you should know is we found him going through your folks' old home. Maybe you should take him to see your father first. - Sweetheart, I don't know. Dad's just. Aaron, you wanna to go see Dad? Aaron, you need to know that his mind has deteriorated a lot over the last few years. He's not gonna know who you are. You have to know that. Hey, Dad. It's me, Andrea, your daughter. And Erin, your granddaughter, is here too. - Hi, Grandpa. - I've already had lunch. Please come back a little later. It's your turn. And no making up new words this time. - Who are you talking to, Dad? - What do you mean? I'm talking to Keith. - Look, Dad, I brought you a visitor. - Sorry, child. You're a lovely young woman but I'm not your father. Hey, buddy, sit down. You can play for Keith. Come on. Come on. Sure. All right, you go ahead. He was starting over here. That's very nice, but you can't use a proper name. - Dad, he's introducing himself to you. Aaron is his name. - I know the name of my own boy. Where's you're lovely Lucey, huh? Beautiful Lucey, huh? Damn it, Aaron. I love you, son, but you were never too graceful. You know, I wouldn't, I don't think you should join the service because I don't think I would feel too good about you carrying a gun. - She was diagnosed around Thanksgiving, 10 years ago. The doctor said she never stood a chance. It spread so fast. But if she was scared of dying, she never showed it. As a matter of fact, right before she went, she smiled and she told us that she would say hello to you for us. You know, it never occurred to me until just now that you weren't there waiting for her. - Hey Bobby, what's going on? - Someone broke into a house on Waverly Street last night. Turns out it was that kid who disappeared in the Gulf War like 20 years ago. And everyone thought he was dead. You know I have never seen anything like this before. All of his vital systems seem to be functioning like a textbook 20 year old. But it's like he's frozen in time. - That's nice, now what about the inability to speak? - I can't find any reason physically why he can't talk. I assume he was just exposed to some kind of a traumatic experience that has affected his desire to want to talk. - Wow. So you're saying that maybe he needs a psychiatrist? - I think for now let's let him get used to being back at home, feeling comfortable. I think that once he's reacclimated to his environment, I think he'll start to talk again. If for whatever reason he doesn't, then we'll pursue our other options. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Thanks, doc. - You're welcome. - I guess we take him home, huh? - Leo. Hey, thank you. - Thank you. - Hey, just a regular coffee. Okay. - Connor, put that on my bill, please. Sure. - Lucey. - Hey, David. - It's nice to see you. - You too. - So, you got my message about this evening, right? - Yeah, I did. - Any chance we may see you there? - Can we talk? - Yeah, of course. Sure, please. - I'm sorry I haven't called you back. I'm still trying to wrap my head around all of this. - I know. We all are. Lucey, if you don't show up tonight, it's okay. Nobody's gonna think any less of you. It's an awkward situation. - No, I want to come, I do. It's just that uh, it took so much for me to get over losing him. I mean, it was the hardest thing I've ever done. And bringing all of that back, I don't know if I can handle it, David. So, he's really back? It's really him? - Yeah. Look, Lucey, I hope to see you there tonight, I mean, come on, we all do. But you need to be selfish with this. It's okay. Just do what's best for you. Come on. I'll see you. There you go. Here, Come on. You got her? Here, pal, try this one, it's light. This one's for you, Erin. Good afternoon, Sheriff. - Good afternoon. Can I help you? - Quite possibly. - Do me a favor and go inside. I'll see you in a second, Aaron. Go on, take Erin inside. - Lovely little girl you have there. That young man though, he's a bit peculiar, isn't he? - Well that's my wife's brother. He's just returned home after being gone a very long time. - I know, I've been reading all about him. - Who are you? - Just a concerned citizen. A friend. - Okay. So what is it you're concerned about, friend? - The whereabouts of your wife's brother for the past 20 years. Don't you think that it's a little bit strange that he hasn't aged at all in the 20 years he's been missing? - Actually, we never really thought about it like that. We're just happy to have him home. - As you should be. But he's not here for good. - What do you mean by that? - They reappear, then three, six, sometimes 10 days later, they disappear. It's different every time. - Okay, who do you work for? - I think that the reason they don't talk is because they forget how. My theory is that up there they communicate by telepathy. - Okay. I don't who you are or what it is that you want, but I do suggest that you get off my property. I also suggest you stay away from my family. - He doesn't have a lot of time left, Sheriff. He's already been here two days. - The three of clubs? - No. - King of clubs? - Uh uh. - Ace of clubs? - No. - Nine of clubs? - So where the hell has he been this whole time? - I don't know. - I'm sure glad I got out of going to that hell hole, you know? Could have been me. Could have been me instead of that poor SOB. - It's crazy, I heard that when they found him, he was naked like a newborn. It's like he fell out of the sky. - Karma's a bitch, ain't it? - What do you mean? - Well, let's put it this way, he wasn't exactly the nicest kid in town. There weren't a whole lot of people all torn up when he went MIA. He was a real charmer, you know that? So, um, I did a little research on that suited woman, right? Apparently every time an MIA soldier reappears, this group comes out of the woodwork and screams conspiracy theory. They, believe that these soldiers were abducted by aliens. - Aliens? Really? Come on, that's ridiculous. - Hey, I'm just saying that's the lady's MO. - They really believe this? - Mm hm. - Aaron was not abducted by little green space men. Right? - I don't know what to say anymore. I have no clue what's going on. How's he doing anyway? - He's not even at his own party. He's been standing by the barn for about an hour. - Alone? - Yeah. Yeah, I think., you know, he's just disappointed that Lucey didn't come. - She might show. - No. - Lucey's not coming. - Here ya go. You see anything up there? You know Aaron, about Lucey, I just want you to know that, um, it was real rough for her, man. We were all kind of worried about her for a long time. As time went on, she came to terms with the situation. She met James. Nice guy. Nice guy. To be honest, he kind of saved her life. They got married, had a kid. She gets her life back on track, Aaron, and then you come back, pop up out of nowhere after 20 years, man. All I'm saying is that you'll see her. You'll see her in time. And when you do, the time will be right. I mean you're not going anywhere, right? Right, you're not going anywhere, are ya? - Thank you for seeing me home, young man. I really had a wonderful time. You can come by any time for Scrabble, Keith. It's always a pleasure to see you. - Hello, Aaron. Can I give you a ride, son? I can take you to your sister's house. Hop in. Come on. Come on. It's okay. Actually we're gonna go get a cup of coffee. My treat. There's something I'd love to talk to you about. First off, Aaron, I just wanted to welcome you home. Where have you been for so long, son? You're not staying, are you? I didn't think so. Look, I don't wanna hurt anyone. On the contrary, I wanna help. I want to understand. About them. You're reading my thoughts right now, aren't you? That's how you communicate, isn't it? I just want to understand. Help me to understand, Aaron. Dude. Dude, you got about three seconds before-- - Wait, that's the guy. - This guy? - He's my mom's boyfriend that went missing all those years ago. She showed me pictures of you. She still talks about you sometimes. - I hate to interrupt, Aaron, but can we please finish? - Uh, who are you? - I don't want any trouble, kid. - It looks like you're the one looking for trouble here, lady. - It's half an hour past your curfew, young lady. I, uh. We'll be upstairs. - I didn't believe it was you. Even after I saw your picture. Sorry I didn't get to your welcome home party. It's been a confusing week. Do you drink coffee? It's really you. For years I dreamt about running into you, what I would say to you. The first year you were gone, I saw you everywhere. I'd see you in every dark haired man on the street. One time I even grabbed a total stranger and began to hug him and cry. That's Lindsey. My little baby. You've met her. She's just a couple of years shy of the age we were when you left. Can you believe that? That's James, Lindsey's father. He works most nights, that's why he's not here right now. But he was never you. Something wrong with the front door? - I'm gonna smoke a cigarette. - I should take you home. Something happened? Something that's making you not wanna talk? Whatever it was, it must have been bad. No? I'm just glad to have you back. It's like you never left. If it wasn't for me, I'd swear we just traveled back in time. I just wish that there was some way that you could assure me this is not just a dream. Okay. Okay, well, it's past your curfew too, so come on. I work for the local paper. I've been there for about eight years now. Anyway, I'm usually home about seven. I'd really like to see you again. Whatever it is, you can tell me. Good night, Aaron. - Lucey. - Hey, sweetie. Hey. - How was work? Where ya been? - I just gave a friend a ride home. - Is there something going on I should know about? - No. - I know he was the love of your life. You never talked about him. But I knew. - He was the love of my life. That was 20 years ago. You're my life now, you and Lindsey. - You still have feelings for him though. - It's confusing. He was dead. We had a funeral for him. And it took me a very long time to get over him. - I'm goin'. Oh. Oh my God, Aaron. Aaron, what is this, what happened to you? Aaron. Let me see, let me see, let me see. Oh, Aaron. Are you sure you're okay? Aaron, maybe I should call the doctor. Look, I so wish that I knew what you've been through. You're gonna make me wait til you're ready to tell me, huh? Okay. - Come on in, man. Come on in, man. Come on, take a seat. You remember our band The Moody Dudes, right? Can you believe that? The Moody Dudes. Fortunately for us, our music was a lot better than the name of the band, bro. Come on, take a seat, Aaron. You liked this one, I remember you loved this one. You know, Keith and Tim came over after the war and we had a pretty cool jam session, man. It brought back a lot of memories, let me tell you. It wasn't the same without you, man. You know what that is, right? I'm sure you remember that, man. ♪ They said we made your shoes, now walk a mile ♪ ♪ What do they think I am, a crocodile ♪ ♪ Believin' you could see my breath ♪ ♪ The years freezing shear ♪ ♪ And maybe your smile ♪ ♪ I'm pleading to catch my death here ♪ ♪ I'm leaving you to sit on this ♪ ♪ Oh, I ♪ ♪ Wait let's see ♪ ♪ What was it I wanted to show you ♪ ♪ I can't picture you ♪ ♪ I'm on my way to mimosas ♪ ♪ You don't miss ♪ ♪ I don't want you along ♪ ♪ Oh no ♪ ♪ Wait let's see ♪ ♪ What was it I wanted to show ya ♪ ♪ I can't picture you ♪ ♪ I'm on my way to mimosas ♪ ♪ Sit on this, I don't want you along ♪ ♪ Oh no ♪ ♪ Sit on this, I don't want you along ♪ It's incredible, isn't it? 20 goddamn years, man. I mean there was a funeral and everything. A lot of people showed up for it too. I heard it was really nice. A lot of people were real broken up. A lot of people weren't. Yeah. - I don't remember you drinking that much. - Yeah. I don't remember you saying so little. Besides, I've got a lot on my mind since the war. - Like what? - Y'know, maybe it was my fault that you were taken away. - There was nothing you could do, right? - Is that what you think? It's the truth. - No. I don't believe you. That's not what you believe. - You were my brother, my best friend. And you looked into my eyes, and then you turned away. - I froze, man. I just froze. I mean, I thought that maybe there was something I could do to help, y'know, to give you a chance, but uh, I just started thinking about this place. I thought about being back here and, uh, yeah, I decided to save myself. - And you did. You took care of yourself. - Yeah, sure. After awhile they thought I was a liability, you know? I was discharged. They put under psychiatric evaluation, man. And you know what, I don't care. I don't care about any of that anymore. I was just thinking about you, man, and where you were and hoping that one day that you would forgive me. I knew that you would forgive me. I knew that you'd forgive me, Aaron. And I started thinking about your folks, man, about your folks and about Lucey and about Andrea. What if they knew? What if they knew what I did? I couldn't tell anybody. I walked around this town for 20 years not being able to tell anybody. Nothing! Yeah, I have to live with that. That's my fault and I know that. I walked away. Yeah. Yeah, I walked away, man. So, I guess a little alcohol here and there makes it a little easier. Cheers, Aaron. - Cheers? - Mm hm. - There's another one, sorry about that. - Why don't you just do it? - Do what? - No, do it. - Do what? - What you been wanting to do for 20 years. Come on, do it. Do it. Do it man. You remember we used to come here on days off of school, man? Just kick back and hang out. I remember one day you invited Lisa Ass-Face and what's her face, Schnulie? - Julie Schnulie. - Julie Schnulie. By the way, I remember you asked to play Truth or Dare, man, and you made out with Lisa Ass-Face. - That was you. - No, it was you and she was the ugliest woman on the planet. She was so ugly, she could haunt a house. You made out with the ugliest woman. - No, you made out with her, you did. You had the picture. Do you have that picture? - The crippled nipple? - The crippled nipple. - Hey man, I just slept with her. You made out with her. Which one did favor? You had a favorite. It was. - The little one. - Hey. - Hey. The master fishermen. How did you do? - Not good. - We caught an elusive cow fish. - Yeah, steaks. Steaks from the supermarket, actually. - So you are an awful fisherman. But you're handsome, so it's okay. Listen, I'm gonna take Erin to the park for a little bit and you are gonna cook the cowfish? - Mm hm. - Good. You okay? - Yeah, I'm good. - I'm cooking. - Good, yeah. - Get out of my kitchen. - You want to come to the park? - Yeah. - Okay. - Let's leave the master. - You got it. Out of my kitchen. - And hey, buddy. - Yeah? - I've got a surprise for you. We're going out tonight, somewhere special. - She's beautiful, isn't she? - Yeah. - So, what do you think? - About what? - Your baby sister. I was 12 when you left. - I think you're beautiful. Just like her. - You know, when you left I was really too young to understand it at all. It took me a long time. Mom and Dad would try and hold it together whenever I was around, but I saw them cry a lot. - I wish I could have been there for you. I'm so glad David was, my friend David. You married my friend David. - You know it was you who brought us together. He never really talked about what happened over there. He was always really vague about it. I always felt like he knew a lot more than he was telling me. But I learned that there are certain things that you just don't ask about. Mommy, can you push me? - Go on. She's your niece. - Hi. - Hi. Want a push? - Yeah, sure. - Did you know that when your mom was a little girl, I used to push her on this same swing? This very one right here. - You're Mom's big brother. - Yup. - You look like Mom's little brother. - I suppose I do. - Were you scared up in the sky? - What do you mean? - Up in the sky, where you live. What's it like? - Who told you that? - The man from the sky. - Do you see a man in the sky? - Sometimes. Do you? Uncle Aaron, I like that we have the same name. - Me too, sweetie. I'm happy you're here. I wish you didn't have to go. - Hey, Bobby. - Someone is here to see you. - Hi. - Hi. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. - You want to get out of here? - Yes. - Okay. - Okay. - Are you hungry? - No. - Then where do you want to go? - I'd like to show you something. - Okay. This is what you wanted to show me? - This is where I woke up. - Out here? How did you get here? - I don't know. - Well, what do you remember? - Pieces. Only pieces. I remember you. Crying after I was gone. - What do you mean? - You went to our tree. You went to the bridge where we kissed for the first time. You contemplated jumping. I remember feeling as if I were there. So much pain. There was nothing I could do. - Where have you been all this time, Aaron? - Come on. - Oh there you are. We were just passing through and we saw your car. And we wanted to make sure that everything was okay. - Everything's fine. - How are you, Aaron? What's goin' on in those woods? - Nothing, we just went for a walk. - Seems a little off the beaten path. - Who exactly are you? - Friends of Aaron. Right, Aaron? I just wanted to make sure that everything was okay now that he's home. Aaron's been through a traumatic experience. - I'm fine. - Well, look who's talking again. We're just gonna make sure that Aaron gets home okay. - I think I'm perfectly capable of making sure he gets home okay. - Trust me, you have no idea what's going on here. - I think we need to leave now. - Aaron, I've tried to be nice to you. But I'm beginning to lose my patience. Now, this is a micro tracker. You see, we make a small incision, we put it under your skin and you won't feel anything. It's totally painless. And you'll never see or hear from us ever again. - You're not gonna touch him. - But he's gonna be gone soon and then it'll be too late. You of all people should appreciate knowing where he goes. - I don't care. He's here now, that's all that matters to me. - He's gonna have to come with us. - Let's go. - Take 'em. - I think we lost them. Who are they? - I'm not really sure. - Well, they wanna track you. Where do they think you're going? Does this have something to do with where you've been the last 20 years? Are you home to stay? You're not? - Being here with you right now is more than a wish coming true for me. - For me too. - I love you, Lucey. I always will. Whether I'm here or not. I haven't been here in years. I know. I'm sorry. - Don't be sorry. - You should go home. - Should I? - Hi, Dad. - Your mother isn't home yet? No. - Any idea where she is? - Not really. - Did she say what time she'd be home? - She didn't say. - I called her at work. Louise says she left early with Aaron. - You want to wait out front for me? - Sure. - It's fine. Stay. You guys spent time with him, right? - Yeah, we saw him the other night at the diner. So? - So what? - So what do you think of him? - Well, he's a couple beers short of a six pack. I guess I would too if I spent half my life as a hostage. - Is that what you think happened to him? - I don't know, guess so. What else? - You don't have anything to worry about, Dad. - Who's worried? You shouldn't be smoking. - Hi, sweetie. - I'm goin' out. - Hey, first round's on me. - You know, I keep my shotgun right next to the john 'cause that's the most vulnerable position a man can be in. All of a sudden, I hear floor boards creaking. So I get up and I grab my gun and I sneak out there and I sneak up on this little son of a bitch rifling through my wife's clothes in the closet. - No kidding? - Yeah. I thought at first he was there, he was gonna rape my wife. Turns out he just wanted to wear her clothes. - Hey, Kyle. Do me a favor and keep it down a little, will you please? - Sorry, Sheriff. I didn't mean to offend you or your friend. - Oh my God. I can't believe it's really you. - It's me. - How you doin', David? - I'm doin' good, Lisa. How you doin'? Good, good. - It is so good to see you, Aaron. What a miracle it is having you back here. - Hey, Lisa. - Have you seen Lucey since you've been back? It must be rough on her. She loses you, finally moves on with her life, gets married, has a kid, then poof, you're suddenly back. - Lisa. - What? Just sayin'. - Hey, Lisa, baby. Come back here. - I'm not your baby, Mike. Mind your own business. Sorry about that. - Look, let me ask you a question. - Sure, baby, anything. - You remember years ago, we took a day off school, the three of us, we went to the park or somethin' - Oh no. - With Julie Schnule. - Schnule. - Schnule, right. - Wow. I haven't thought about that in a long time. - Now the question is who did you make out with? - It was you, David. It wasn't me, Lisa. - Secretly though, I wished it was you. - Hey, baby. Let's dance. - Mike, you're drunk. Ask me again when you're sober. I'm dancing with Aaron anyway. - Mike. - Sheriff. - Oh my God. Oh my God. - Hey, time's up. Hey. God damn God damn. Hey, hey! You all right? Hey! - Oh God. - Go, go, go. Hello, this is Sheriff Mendell. Listen to me very carefully, I have a priority one en route. We're moments away. I want all medical staff on hand, do you understand me? - Jesus, David. He's bleeding all over. How far are we, James? - Still five minutes out, David. - We're five minutes away. - Hurry. - Please have all available staff standing by. Yeah. I'm not sure, hopefully soon though. Yeah. I'll call you as soon as I know, okay? Okay. I love you too, baby. Bye. - Can we go home now? - Yeah. Of course. - Oh my God. - It's okay. - No, I was gonna come meet you. - He's fine. He was perfectly fine. I don't know how. The last time I saw that much blood come out of a man, he was anything but okay. But he's fine. You were with him today, weren't you? - Yeah. - Is there anything you want to tell me? About him? Where he disappeared to all those years? He must have told you something. - He didn't. - I've been trying to put myself in your shoes since this whole thing happened and when I do, I don't like what goes through my head. - Getting over him was the hardest thing I ever had to do. But getting over him wasn't the worst part. Not knowing was the worst part. So now I know. Now I know that he's okay and for me, that's enough. Hey, kiddo. - Hi, Mommy. - I am so sorry I'm late again. - This is the third time in to weeks. - I know, Mrs. Helman. I am so sorry. Hey, why don't you grab your backpack? - Mrs. Mendell, do you mind if I talk to you for a minute? - Yeah, of course. Look, why don't you take your uncle out to the yard and I'm gonna meet you there, okay? Come on. Come on. - Sweetie, where's your uncle? - He's sick again. The people took him to the hospital. - What people? - Don't worry, Mommy. He'll take care of him. - Who will? - Him. - Come on sweetie, we gotta go. - What? Are you sure? Oh my God. I'm on it, I'm on it. - Hospital reported a missing ambulance. Do you think it's them? - I do. Do me a favor, call Ottawa County, get every available agent they can spare. Get me some eyes in the air. - Got it. - Okay? - What's happening to you? - There's a lot of blood here. - Aaron, where were you when you were shot? - Desert. - But that was 20 years ago. That would have killed you then. How are you alive now? - Please, take me back. - Where do you want us to take you? - Woods. - What's in the woods? Who's waiting there? - Stop the bleeding. - I've got to get him to a hospital. - Just get the goddamn tracker in him. - It's an ambulance, for Christ's sake. How hard can it be? - Yeah, a vehicle in the Allegan Woods. How hard could that be? - Where are they going? Well, where's David? I think I know where they might be taking him. Okay, I'll be right over. - What's goin' on? - Aaron was taken. - Taken by who? - I'm not really sure. They've got him in a stolen ambulance. - So what are you gonna do? - What do you want? - I need your help with somethin'. - What the hell's going on? - Just get dressed and come on out. And bring your shotgun. - Eagle One, what's your 20? I'm tracking them over 112, Delta One. - I'm on 112 right now, guys. This road doesn't lead anywhere so stay on them, Eagle One. 10-4 I have eyes on them. I've lost them in the brush, Delta One. - Copy, Eagle One. Thank you. Heading back to base, Delta One. - Watch him. What the hell is going on? - Looks like someone's blocking the road. - Are they cops? - No. - Then use the siren. - Sorry young lady, this road is closed. - You need to get out of my way, son. Hey! Drop it, my friend. Q This is none of your concern. - You got him, James? This way, let's get him in the car. How's he doing back there, Lindsey? - He's not doing good.

Please help him. - Lucey. - Do you have to go? - I wish I didn't. But I do. And I'll be back before you know it. - I love you. - I love you. Hey lover boy, come on, we gotta go. Take care of him, okay? - I promise, I promise I will. And don't you worry, we're coming back to do some big things, I promise you that. - Don't worry, Lucey. I'm indestructible.
