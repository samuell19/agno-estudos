So you looked pretty good doing that red carpet shimmy! Yeah, I know. I would rather elope than go through all this! Can't wait to walk down your aisle. Oh yeah. I never get married in Chinese restaurant. Oh yeah? Where would you do it, rebel? I'm not telling you. Come on. Hey, hey, wait! Wait! It's going to be outdoors. What is? When I get married. By a lake... ...with trees and grass and flowers everywhere. And, we'll have a string ensemble playing... Playing what? And the grass will be totally soft and clean, so the bridal party can all walk barefoot. And... And... ...you'll have nothing but sons and your mom will thank her ancestors' star and finally give you the freedom you so long for. Except, by then... ...you'd be needing to please all the little boys. Especially the zhong guo ren you married. Hey, Kim? I think that's your Ma. Shit! Ah Kim, you such smart girl! Why go be cheap labor for Americans, huh? You see, Jenny, good Chinese girl, huh? Going to have a big fat son soon, huh? He just want the best for you, you know? He think of your poor father.

Whoa, what's going on here? Look, I'm... I'm really tired. I had a long night. No, no... No way! For the last time, lower your voice! Ma, I... there's got to be some mistake. She... Mrs Liu, I'm very sorry for my son's behavior. Sorry? What for, Ma? You're going to take some stranger's word over mine? Sit back down before you lose face for the whole family. - Mrs Liu... - This is bullshit! ...you know our customs. We cannot hold a wedding banquet during our mourning period. You don't mind? Wedding? No need to waste money anyway. Let me go get the lunar calendar so we can at least pick a lucky day. Ma don't you think I should discuss this with Kim? This is your doing, isn't it. No. I mean, wait. This is not Shanghai. So... okay. Calendar! It wasn't my fault, Ma. Your baba is not here to protect you anymore. Fuck! His sisters are not like this. Four times I tried to have a son. When are you due? Where are you going? Out. Daniel family, good family. You learn to be happy, okay? Willie no future for you. Kim... You already make one mistake. You can never change back. Don't make bigger one. Hurt whole rest of your life. Yes, yes, of course, Mr Johnson. You know, I always guarantee that. Only the best for you, Mr Johnson. Yes, yes no problem. Absolutely! Okay, Mr Johnson. Thank you! Bye-bye. Kim, you know I always think you're smart and nice girl. But this is happy time for you. You get married. You should be with husband. You don't need work. I want to be independent. I don't understand. You said, come work for me. That was before. Look Kim, we are a family business. All our clients like traditional family and ah you know, people talk. They talk rumours. Not nice. But, if you home with husband, give him son, people don't talk. They listen. I understand. Thank you, Uncle Huang, for taking the time. Kim, I would like to help. You lucky. Back in China, who want girl not clean? Daniel! Do it yourself. Drop the act. Don't flatter yourself by letting whatever my mom says get into your head. You could have been some whore off the street coming here crying rape. She would have believed you over me for whatever fucked up thing she has against me. So lets just clear this once and for all. I married you because it was easier than getting cut off. But I can get anybody. Kim? What are you doing? Oh! I- I just um.. ...going out for some air. Why do you walk down the stairs in such a hurry like that? You might hurt the baby. You know the saying. You don't want to shift the baby's chi. You shouldn't move around so much. Did you finish your Ren-Shen soup? Um... yes. Good. I'm cooking some more right now. This time I added hongzhao, too. More boo. More nutritious Could I... Could I have some ice cream, please? Ice cream is too cold for the baby. That's not good. You need warm foods. I just saw your mother. She's so proud. Daniel... ...is sorry he couldn't come. I saw the baby! Very beautiful. I'm sorry. No! Girl just as good! Just as good. Anyway... ....boy turns out like Daniel. No good, right? Okay. You have some-- some soup and rest. Thank you. Ah, this is--this is for you. I'm--I'm only going to stay a minute... Would you like me to bring little Genie in? She's almost ready for her feeding. No, no, no, I'm not doing that. Oh, I meant for you to hold the bottle. It's uh-- Her chart already says you're not breastfeeding. Sorry, I mean... No, thank you. I... I'm just... ...a little bit too tired right now. Well... you know where the call button is. You... You better go. I would like to spend some time alone with... ...with uh my... ...my baby at feeding time. Okay. Okay, come on up here. Hey, to the new family. Young Mr & Mrs Chang. And Baby Chang. Oh, its okay, okay. Okay. Baby hungry. Eat. Eat. What would you like? Oh, Genie! I think Genie's sick. She has fever. Well ask my mom for money. Why should I ask your mom? You're the father. Oh, am I? What? Got you out of Chinatown, didn't it? Tell the truth. Who put you up to this? Bastard! You bastard! Daniel! Shut up, all of you! What's going on here? Don't you hear the baby crying? Bye! What's going on here? Don't you hear the baby crying? Hey... um... I left the food out for Daniel. He just need to heat it up when he gets back. Good night. Oh, Kim. I'll be... ...in a few days... ...going away for a while, back to Shanghai. I have some business left in Shanghai. I need to go take care of it. Mom, I'm sorry. I totally forgot it was today. I can drive you to the airport. Okay, ma? Ma, come on this is silly. Don't take a taxi. Go in and take a bath you smell like a bar! Shit! I'm tired of this shit. Hey, what happened? Daniel not like your cooking? Mom. Tell him you can still have son next time. So what you do wrong? Everything. Mom. I'm sorry. Here's some money. I-- I'll be back. Get her soon. Where are you going? Kim, what are you doing? I just... I'll be right back. You go say goodbye to baby. No. You go say goodbye to baby. You look at Genie and say goodbye, or she miss you. I'll see her in a few days. She won't miss me, okay? No need money. You should be responsible mother. You shame like this. Not take care of family. Mom, I'm sorry. Ma ma Hey lady, you still haven't told me where we're going. Uh... Um... Uh... Airport. You wouldn't believe the horrendous trip I had. Five cities in three and a half days. Didn't even have time for jet lag. Thanks for taking the time to come to graduation. Um, of course, I... Mom. Um... Oh, ah. ...this is for you. From Guangzhou. Ah. You can buy this all in Chinatown now. Yea, but probably not the same quality. All same-same-la. Not so different. Well, um... At least I got a good workout carrying it all the way here. Um... Oh, um... This is for you. Wah, so shiny. Thanks, Kim. I um... I'm sure you can get it here too. But it'll probably say "Made in Hong Kong" anyway so I... Thanks. You want to try it on. See if it fits, maybe? It's too hot now. I'm sure it's fine. Great. Eat, eat, eat, eat. You too skinny. Show wrinkle. Eat or become old lady like me before even get married again. Ah... why you not stay here? Hotel too expensive. You stay in Genie's room. She lie there and watch TV too late every night anyway. Now, you stay here. No need to pay expensive hotel. Po. Um, no, no, no. It's... It's okay. The um... The bank is paying for my hotel anyway. Oh. Bank pay for you to come to graduation, too? No, I mean... Um... Yes, they paid for the trip, but I specifically arrange it so that I could come as a business trip. * I'm feeling locked a cultural prisoner I can't leave * * My walls extend to the Far East there's no release. * * The chains of my tradition and skin enclose me * * But I never chose love Love chose me * * Vicious cycle of my history repeats trapped in this * * Do we save face or save our happiness * * They say our walls protect us * * But the spell of love is infectious * * So what other options am I left with * * The sins of the past visit the present and chain us * * Mothers and daughters more like enemies and strangers * * But I have to shape my world It can't shape me * *I walk the path of my mother Move until you break free* Whoa. Whoa-- whoa. What's wrong? I just thought we'd talk for a minute first. Oh, aren't you sweet. Ooh wee! That was great conversation. Can't you stay the night? Or the morning? Sorry. Is it just my body? I do have other attributes. Let me drive you home. You don't have a car. I'll carry you on my back. I'll call you tomorrow. Or er... ...or the next day. What do you have a parole officer or something? You're onto me, man. It's a dangerous world out there. Bye. It's a dangerous world out there. This is ridiculous. I don't need a chaperone. It's three o'clock in the morning, Genie. You just had to be the man, don't you? I believe the word is gentleman. Plus my mother told me I had to. Ah Genie. Hey Po. I got heat something for you. You eat some. No, no, no, no. I'm not hungry. It's the middle of the night. Go back to sleep. Okay, okay. Hey, your mother want you call her at hotel tomorrow. You know Po, I'm mad at you. Me? What I do? I'm nice old lady. All these years, you never once let me hate my mother. You always stood up for her. She my daughter. She make mistake. So, you forgive her? Maybe not. Maybe not mistake for you to be with me. Maybe forgive her for you. Good night. * You can't leave me open * * Its not like I lost my stride * * If you're living inside my dreams * * inside my dreams * * You just woke up next to me tonight * * I'll school you on how to like me * * Help you remember me * * Cause I'm past your face * Just um Just fax it to me in the morning. No, no, no, my morning. Okay? I really have to go. Sorry. Okay. Bye. I really have to go. Sorry. Okay. Bye. I'm really sorry. So nice to see you again. Um... I-- I wanted to talked to you because uh... What I'm trying to tell you is um... My company wants to transfer me out of Hong Kong. Um... I could either move back to California or New York. And I was thinking... What's wrong with California? Nothing. But I-- I prefer New York. Well, then what are you asking me for? I... I did not ask you anything yet. I should get going. Genie. Genie, wait! I got some ice cream for you. Thought you might like it. Strawberry. Genie, please. I would just like to know how you would really feel if I moved back here. Maybe you could think about it and get back to me later. What difference is it going to make? Whatever makes ah-Kim happy, that's the rule of thumb. Oh and if you're saying you're staying, but end up going back to California... ...you better tell Po know ahead of time... ...because I don't think she'll be able to handle another one of your disappearances all over again. You know, I'm glad you called. Actually, I was just thinking about you. You were? Yeah. Kicking myself for not paying more attention in math class, you know, back in the days? Oh, I'm Asian, therefore I remind you of math class. Man, you like an angry black man in an Asian girl body or something. No! I'm talking about probability. If I had taken a little time to take my headphones off back in math class... ...I probably would have figured out your digits by now. Get it? Hint! Hint! Well, it's nice seeing your pearly whites from time to time. Yes, he's very happy. Actually he's uh... Actually he's uh... He's taking me out to dinner tonight, believe it or not. Yea, I'm sure he's going to ask me to... ...reconsider the L.A. offer. Quickly, your mother waiting. Hey, Mom. Genie, congratulations. Thanks, Kim. Hey, picture time here. Hey! You're supposed to ask before you take a picture. Look, I-- I just want-- Okay enough for one day. Everybody need to be happy. And old lady need a rest. Can we get out of here now? * When we first met didn't say much to one another * * Never a brother known for chitchat forget that * * At the time both of us talking to someone else * * But what I felt was like something I couldn't help * * Wanted to be around and I wanted to be down * * Proceeded with caution knowing that I caught you off the rebound * * To me it was no thing but it soon became apparent * * You wasn't looking for no fling * * After the first taste cooking the whole thing * * Anticipating the phone ring * * When we communicated I could hear your soul sing * Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing here? I was just in the neighborhood. Hey you! I was just in the neighborhood. Ah it's okay, Mr. Leong. I know this guy, sort of. Okay. Okay. Okay. Say hello to Grandma. - Nice meeting you. - Okay, I will. Thanks, Mr. Leong. What do you mean, "sort of"? What do you mean, "I was in the neighborhood"? I wanted to see you. What's the big deal? The big deal is very obvious, Michael, and you're not paying attention. This whole role reversal thing is driving me nuts. I'm supposed to be the one quiet, not-really-ready-to-commit asshole who only calls when he's horny, right? Oh, you're calling me an asshole? No! What can I tell you? I know exactly what I want. And what is that? Huh? People don't mind mixed couples. Do you know what year it is? Year of the Rat. It is? Really? All that stuff interest me. You know what? Maybe I can convert for you... ...shed my skin. What? No. It's not about that. Look, I just need to separate things. It's not simple. Simple as this. Hey! No PDA! Does that only apply in Chinatown? I'm affectionate, that's me! Look, I like you, Michael. You like me. That's a start. Well, maybe you could call me, or wait, wait, I call you? Or is it just my voice too black on the phone? Hey Hey, hey, hey, hey! Okay? Just... ...keep Queens off limits for a while, will you? You know, I got a bigger Chinatown in the city. I can save my buck fifty. But I only got one little special China girl. Now, get out of here. Po, I'm home! Po. I got all your groceries and I got some new hair dye for you. It's supposed to last longer. The ladies at the salon sa-- Oh Po, what's wrong? Oh my God, Po , can't you speak? Look at me. Do you recognize me? Po! Po, I'm... I'm going to call an ambulance. I'm going to call an ambulance. You're going to be okay. How can Po be okay? You like your mother. You... No, Po. Don't. Everybody in Chinatown see you with Hak-Gwei. You disgrace! Don't say the wrong thing now. All my daughter make me ashamed. Now I have to lose more face! What are you saying? It's a curse. You are a curse. Your mother. I tried to change her mistake. You bigger mistake. This long... and your grandfather still cannot rest underground in peace. Po, don't say that. I didn't do anything wrong. I'm not like her! You have no shame. No face! No face for me. I worked so hard... ...all for you! And you just turn out one worse than the other. Lock the door behind me. Lock the door behind me. Genie! Genie? Mom! Mom, are you okay? What happened? I made you a mixtape. Might cheer you up. Thanks. Oh, I got something else for you. What is this for? This way I can reach you... ...when I miss you. And how do I handle the groupies' booty pages, Mr DJ? You tell them the truth, unavailable. Need help with this? No. Hmm? No. No. Look. I'm sorry, okay? Yeah. How dare you mess up my life? Well, I just shifted the light, you know, in the club. All of a sudden, there you were. You know? I thought, "Damn she hot!" And you opened your mouth... ...then I thought... "She real, too." I didn't know that much about your world. I just wanted to know you. Come here. Genie! Genie, wait! Genie! Genie, wait! What after all these years you're suddenly worried now? Genie, can we please talk? I have nothing to say. Genie, stop! Let go of-- Let go of me! Sorry, Genie. Can I take you to lunch? I'm supposed to be at work right now. Genie. Genie. I already talked to your friend. She agreed to cover for you. Shit Kim, why did you have to do that? Genie, I just need to talk to you. Well I don't need to talk to you. If this is about Po and me you're pretty much the last person who can help. Genie... ...the only man I've ever really loved in my life... ...wasn't even good enough for her. And he was Chinese. You don't know anything about Po, and you sure as shit don't know anything about me. And you don't know anything about me. Sure, but I'm also not interested. Oh sorry man, is this your car? I'm going. Please don't come here stalking us like this. Let go of the arm. I know who you are. Let go! What do you want from me? Nothing. Then leave us alone. How can I leave you alone if you don't let go of the fucking arm? Sorry. The hell you are! Asshole! Fucking asshole! Okay Ma. The groceries should last you for two weeks. American food. Um. I want to talk to you about something. I don't eat American food. Mom, they're just groceries. I wanted to thank you, Mom-- Now I'm hungry. You want me to make some zhou for you? The bank is transferring me out of Hong Kong. What does that mean? It means... I'll be going back to California. California no different. Po! Po! Po! Are you okay? What you doing... ...hiding around like thief? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you, I just wanted to make sure that you were okay. You still with Hak-Gwei? Po, his name is Michael. Po! Po, wait! Po! Look, it's... Po, it's just you and me. It's always going to be us. I didn't want to hurt you, but... But he's special to me. But I can't lose you. You're my family. You're everything. Hey... ...you not eating. You got too skinny. Po! What do you want me to do? You not see him anymore. He's my friend. I want to see him. You not marry him. Marry him! We're just seeing each other, Po! I'm never going to get married. Never marry? Now you upset me again! Come on, Po. You know I have the key. I think I should move out. * As I was riding on in one train * * My body was aching My heart was breaking * * My breath was taken away * * She ran into me * * And then I don't ask can't I see * * I'm trying to fake it * * 'Cause it's only love from now on * * Just take my breath away * * Take my breath away * * Oooh * * The process of healing still remains * It's your mom again. Could you please just answer the phone? I'm busy. Hey... Hi, Genie. - Did anybody call? - Hi, Genie. Uh-uh. Hey you guys, I'm starving. Want to go grab a bite to eat? Nah, I'm not hungry. Well, then we're going to step out. Alright... Well, then we're going to step out. Sure you don't want to come? Thank you. Alright, bye Genie. No, your keys are not here. I thought I told you-- Look, I just wanted to let you know I am leaving okay? And since it is already established that I am selfish-- That I never asked how you felt. Then just this once more me coming over here to-- To talk about myself won't make a difference, right? Don't give me any excuses. I don't like you. I don't. I get the sense of that. Please. I-- Can I come in? It won't take long. My plane leaves in a couple of hours. Thank you. Okay so... ...if you don't ever want to see me again... ...I just thought... ...it would be really, really important for you to know that... that uh... That the reason I didn't see you much all these years... Well... It wasn't because of you. It was because-- Oh save it. What are you going to tell me that I don't already know? That you never wanted me anyway. That you screwed up. Thanks for paying my tuition. I learned it all in Psych 101. So don't come here trying to act all motherly. I'm sorry.
