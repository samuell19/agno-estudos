Can I get you guys anything? - Uh, you know, let me drive you. (suspenseful music) (golf car whirring) So can I ask you something? - Sure, go ahead. - Do you get paid overtime nights? - Well, only if you go past eight hours. - Huh. We get time and a half, but you make what? 36k a year plus benefits? - What you don't get benefits? - Oh, no they're pretty good. But is it hard to get into the academy? - [Man] Now for our east corridor. - [Security Guard] I'm at the auxiliary feed water. Checking in. - That's good. - All clear at the BWR. - [Security Guard] Uh, PC, our area is secure. - [Security Guard] Clear on the southwest quadrant. - [Security Guard] Moving on to reactor cooling system. - The job in central corridor. - Will check in shortly. - [Security Guard] Pulling up razor resolution. - [Security Guard] Same old, same old. - The reactor pressure- - All gates on lock down? (video game booming) - I don't know. I hear they never accept security guards anyway. - That's not true. It's good experience, right? They're always looking for guys who speak Spanish. - Really? - Yeah. - Hm. - [Announcer] Maintenance to the B water pump. We need maintenance to the B water pump. - [Weatherman] Cold snap continues with unseasonably cold temperatures will launch more wind throughout Southern California. Tomorrow's high reaching about 48. (switches clicking) - Bring it up .2. - Up .2. - [Syed] .2 up. (suspenseful music) (heartbeat thumping) (gunshot banging) (window shattering) (suspenseful music) - [Man] What in the hell? Captain? - Collin, get the manual. - [Collin] Come on, what do you got for us? What do you got? - Main gate, main gate, respond. I repeat, main gate respond. - [Man] We've got a breach, we've got a breach. They're coming! (man groaning) (men grunting) (fist thudding) (man groaning) - [Security Guard] We've got a main gate breach. - [Man] Might be other sectors as well. - Code Red, clear the plant now. (alarm blaring) - [Man] Evac procedure. (gunshots banging) (suspenseful music) - Right in here. (speaking foreign language) That's it. That's it. God, darn it. (speaking foreign language) (man groaning) - [Zoe] What's going on? - Rover Two, what's going on? - Engles. Engles, you there? - Maybe a drill? - [Man] Now, let's keep it moving. Let's go. Come on. - [Man] Let's go, people. Move. - This way. - Engles? (alarm blaring) What do you think this is? - Well, they usually, that's how they do it. They wanna see how we react. - [Zoe] Well, I'm going to call it in. Proceed 1580, I'm at San Juan Nuclear. We have a primary alarm. (alarm blaring) - Busy. I'm gonna lock it down. (mechanical door whirring) Hey, where the hell? (door thudding) (intense dramatic music) - Move it, go! (speaking foreign language) (alarm blaring) (tires screeching) (speaking foreign language) (woman screaming) (speaking foreign language) (gunshots banging) - Still nothing. - Lower the reactor 20%. - [Scientist] Don't you wanna wait for someone to get on in- - We're shutting it down now! (alarm blaring) - [Zoe] What is that? - [Manolo] It's the reactor alarm. It's okay, it's okay. I'm not showing any radiation. - [Zoe] Proceed 1580. We have gunfire and explosions at San Juan Nuclear Facility. (gunshots banging) (explosions booming) OC 3535. - Jesus. (gunshots banging) (dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) - 911, slow down, sir. You're saying San Juan Nuclear Power Plant evacuation sirens? - 911 Emergency. - Yes, sir. 911 emergency. - Nuclear plant shots fired. Got it here, too. (alarm blaring) (keyboard clicking) - [Man] Get out of the walls. Come on, come on! (workers yelling over each other) - Please sir, slow down. - Contact FBI and isn't there an Army base near there? - Sir, you have to- - Marine. - Right, it's like five miles- - Everything will be okay. - From the plant. - We're handling it. - [Dispatch] Yes, sir, I do have your location. - Anybody got a CO number on that? (woman screaming) (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) - [Man] Help! - Get outta the way! - It's all gone. (workers talking over each other) - There's about five of them, probably more. Heavily armed, explosives. There's a while panel truck approaching. Hang on. (dramatic music) No, don't! (gunshots banging) No, no, no! (gunshots banging) (Manolo groaning) (alarm blaring) - Good evening, I'm Robert Covasik. We are interrupting your regularly scheduled programming with a breaking story in Southern California, where we have several unconfirmed reports of shots fired at the San Juan Nuclear Power Plant. We have been told that SWAT teams and police are responding. The San Juan Nuclear Plant is located on the coastline that's about halfway between Los Angeles and San Diego, and it provides nearly 20% of the power to more than 15 million people in Southern California. Once again, we have reports of shots fired and police responding at the San Juan Nuclear Power Plant. (alarm blaring) (rifle pieces clicking) (keys jingling) (door thudding) (light dramatic music) (desk rattling) - Hands in the air. Down on your knees or I'll shoot. - Please, if leave now, we will not kill you. Go home to your family. Go! (boots thudding) (Khalid sighs) (door thudding) - Calibrating feed pumps. - I got 911. Uh, yes, listen. We're in the control room at San Juan Nuclear. - [Technician] Initiating pre-shutdown mode. (car engine rumbling) (door slamming) (tires screeching) - [Man] All right, keep moving this way. (helicopter whirring) (muffled radio chatter) - [Man] Clear the line, huddle up. - Yes, sir! (car door slamming) (soldiers talking over each other) - [Woman] Don't hit your head. (soldiers talking over each other) - [Man] All right, people, we're running out of time. - [Secret Service] Madame Attorney General, we need you to come with us, please. - We're elevating the threat level to red, right? - When, Mr. Secretary? - Immediately, that's when. (phone beeping) (truck engine rumbling) (brakes screeching) (door clanking) (brakes screeching) (speaking foreign language) (tires screeching) (light dramatic music) (bomb timer beeping) (helicopter whirring) - Yeah, we need the NRC on their way. Oh, I know. Just, just, yeah, call my wife, tell her I'll be late. Tell me this is a drill. - It doesn't look that way, sir. - [Tom] Oh, shit. Thanks. - [Man] Oh, yeah, we need a satellite hook-up and feed us in. Repeat, satellite hook-up and then feed us in. - All right, let's get full comm up on the staging area. I need a secure satellite for DC. Someone start scanning with frequencies. I bet these guys are talking to each other. - Yes, sir. - What's your name, son? - [Steve] Agent Richie, Steve. - Agent Richie, I need you to get me all the witnesses you can on this thing. I need specific details like height, weight, number, accents, whatever you can get. All right? You're in charge of that, okay? That's plenty, get going. (Steve sighs) - Yes, sir. - We have just gotten official confirmation from the Department of Homeland Security that the national terror alert has been raised to red, its highest level. The department statement says only that the threat level elevation is due to quote "unfolding events at the San Juan Nuclear Power Facility in San Juan California." Once again, the Department of Homeland Security has, for the first time since its inception, elevated our national terror alert to red. (police sirens wailing) (tires screeching) (heartbeat pounding) - Outside of the main gate. Spotting 911. (gunshot banging) (window shattering) (dramatic music) Shots fired, shots fired! (gunshot banging) Stay down. - Looking at this guy, I want this one right here. Okay, I want that. I want me in the foreground, the plant in the background. Okay? Let's get this thing going. - I can get the shot. - [Cameron] Yeah, this Cameron Clark reporting to you live from the San Juan Nuclear Facility. - Okay, ready? - [Cameron] Where we've had an evacuation. - We're on? Some people are leaving, and yet still others- (muffled radio chatter) - I want you to get it fixed. - I don't care if their responding to 911 calls. I don't want people getting shot. You gotta button this place up. - [Jansen] 911's got the plant supervisor on the line. He's inside in the reactor control room. - What's his name? - Syed Kahn. - Mr. Kahn. - Don't put me on hold. And do not transfer me to anybody else. I want to speak to somebody in charge right now! I'm Tom Shea, I'm Special Agent in command. Tell me how you are. - They're coming down the stairs to the control room. The door is steel and I think it should hold. But they've already gotten through the one outside. - Well, what's happening with the reactor? - It is in shut down sequence now. - So is it safe? - For now it is. - We need a tactical team ready to go in and secure that control room right now! - Hello? Hello? - Mr. Kahn. Yeah, I'm gonna try and stay on the line with you, but I'm doing a couple other things at the same time. Okay? - I'm not going anywhere. - Yeah, we're getting a team ready to go in and secure your area. I'll stay on the line with you until they come in. Is that a fair deal? - Deal. - How long until we can get a force in to secure that area? - CAG's on the way. Going over the plan, I'd say 20 minutes. - 20 minutes? I need 'em in there now. Get me someone from CAG command. - We've got a CHP officer shot dead at the gate. Partners inside, lost contact. Sniper in the crane, several explosions. We also got their broadcast frequency. They appear to be speaking Arabic. - Well, let me put on my big surprise face. - Everything they say streams here. - Let's get the FAA. We need to ground all commercial air traffic. We need satellite surveillance help. - Hello. They're, they're coming down the hallway. They're outside the door. Hello! - Mr. Kahn, you all right? - Oh my god. They're not blowing the door! (explosion booming) (wall thudding) - [Man] Unit four, east wall breached. All right. - They're in. (speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) (shouting in foreign language) (speaking foreign language) - What did he say? - He says they are in control. (dramatic music) - [Man] Why don't you call in a plane? - So they brought this truck and they parked here. So we've gotta assume it has explosives. Now, what are these? - Those are spent fuel pools. They blow that up and we got a huge cloud of radioactive steam. - Thanks. And when you call Charlotte, get her to call Jess. I mean, they should get as far from the zone as possible. - President's been briefed. Air Force One should be on its way from Japan by now. VP's in the bunker. AG and Utley in the sit room. - Find out who's supposed to know about this. CIA, NSA, we're not taking the heat on this alone. - Right. - Who's SAC on the ground? - Tom Shea. - No, no, Nisa. - No, daughter's wedding in Ireland. Shea's number two. - Watch Utley. - Yeah, that prick. (phone ringing) - Good evening, gentlemen. - Evening. - Evening. - NRC is recommending a five mile evacuation for now. Local law and media already have it. - Right now, we have to assume these guys are melting the reactor. - We're pulling plans as fast we can. You just focus on your end. - They're telling me Tom Shea is on this? - Nisa's out of town. Shea's SAC on the ground. - Shea? Tom Shea who punched out the under-secretary in Yemen? - He was not pleased when they shut down the Cole investigation, yes. - Well, do we trust this guy? - Unless we get someone else in there, he's Special Agent in charge. - Well, if you're gonna pull him, do it now. We get in the middle of this thing and the public finds out that we've switched command, not gonna reassure 'em. - Agent Hall? - He speaks the language. His father worked for an oil company, so he did most of his elementary school in Dubai. He knows these people. And he's our guy on the ground. - It's your call, Madame Attorney General. Okay, defenses on site. State and Langley are checking sponsorship. Treasury's doing economic impact. National Guard's being stationed around all national nuclear facilities. White House, Capitol, Pentagon are the class A targets, including federal buildings. (light dramatic music) - Come over here. (Zoe hushes) (Zoe grunting) Come on, Manolo, you gotta help me. Okay, that's it. You're all right. Here we go. We're going back. Okay, come on Manolo. Come on, that's all right. I gotcha. Try to help me out here. I'm gonna try and lay you down, okay? Here we go. Here we go. Easy, easy, easy. Okay, okay. You're gonna be all right. - The president has cut short his trip from Japan and is returning to the United States with F-15 fighter escorts. We are told he will make no public statement until he lands, but that he is in constant contact with all senior government officials. Meanwhile, here we know that the National Guard has been dispatched to secure all nuclear facilities in the country. - [Tim] That's right Robert. In additional, all nuclear power plants have been ordered to shut down, resulting in power brownouts and blackouts from coast to coast, particularly affecting the Northeast. It's important to keep in mind that these are to be expected- - I'm sorry to interrupt you right here, Tim. But we do have an update now about evacuations to give our viewers. We are now being told that the Department of Homeland Security has ordered an evacuation of all nonessential personnel within a five mile radius of the San Juan Nuclear Plant. Now, nonessential personnel would mean that all citizens who are not under the Homeland Security umbrella, police officers and firefighters would be under that umbrella. But all citizens within a five mile radius of the San Juan Nuclear Plant are now asked to evacuate immediately. You can see the area up there on your screens. This does include the entire city of San Clemente to the north down to the Agra freeway exit to the south. So if you are in that area, you are asked to go immediately to your vehicles. Do not wait to collect any personal items. Please go to your vehicles and head to a main road where we are told that you will be guided by police out of that area. We have also been advised to stress that this is a precaution only. But apparently, it is a precaution you should take. - Do not think I would help you. I'd be killing myself, too. You may as well put a bullet in my head right now, because I'm not going to melt down. I left Pakistan because of people like you. - Syed, just let them be. - They will do whatever they will do. - Let them do what they- - Just shut up. Shut up. - Let them. (Zoe grunting) - All right. Okay, here we go. (dramatic music) Put your head up just a little bit. I'm gonna put this under you. Here you go. You're gonna be all right, here you go. Okay. (Zoe sighs) (Zoe groaning) All right, there we go. Okay. (soldiers talking over each other) - [Boggs] Alpha and Bravo, the main perimeter. Delta, south gate, we're gonna have an echo- - Colonel Boggs, Tom Shea, FBI. - We're gonna have several responses to have options in 15. - What does it look like so far? - Problem is once they got the security center, they got a lock on every way in. Post 9/11, NRC shut crawlspaces, sealed underground piping, the perimeter's been electrified, the gates can stop Bradley assault vehicles. - Yeah, that's a great system. It's too bad they left the goddamn front door open. So you guys don't run scenarios on this? Is that? - They train for insertion assault on Al-Qaeda bases, mostly in Afghanistan. - All right, so they train for Tora Bora. They don't run a drill on the nuclear facility down the street. - I thought that was the FBI's job? I know who you are, Shea. You're not the only one who can throw a punch. - It's good to be working with you, Colonel Boggs. - Where were we? - [Zoe] Dispatch 1580. Dispatch 1580. (Manolo wheezing) - Yeah, is five miles enough of an evac if the thing is melting down? - No, if it's melting down, no evac's gonna make a difference. - 'Cause the NRC can't give us any straight answers on how much info these guys could have. - That's 'cause most plant plans were classified post 9/11. - [Jansen] But they were public before? - Yeah, so basically available (dial tone dinging) God! Lines are clogged. Did Charlotte reach Jess? - She said she was trying. - Because I want her out of here. - There's a high percentage we get in before they see us. - A high percentage. If they do see it, there's a high percentage we get nuked. - They're in the control room. They've got a bomb by the spent fuel. - Yeah, they haven't blown it. The longer we wait. The more we're gonna know. The easier it's gonna be for us to make a judgment- - The longer we wait, the deeper they dig in. Now look, we've got a viable action option here. I suggest we take it. - [Jansen] Agent Shea. - I'll keep it in mind. - We got something. - Dust around that side too. - Here you go, sir. - Yeah, thanks. - Witnesses saw two vehicles pick up Middle Eastern looking men from this rental. Car rental closed at 9:00, looking for the manager. - It's the Quran in Arabic. The bookmark, the day of wrath is coming. - Coming? (Jansen scoffs) It's here. - This was so damn easy to find. - This is Jansen. - So close by. - Thanks. Rental home office got a name, Khalid Jara. (muffled police radio) What? - It's a compilation of 9/11 names. There's no good end to this thing, man. - We do not know if those alleged militants arrested in Pakistan are in any way connected to what is happening right now in California. But we do know that in the last hour we have seen several of these arrests. Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf promising to do anything and everything to help the United States in this crisis. Meanwhile, in and around San Juan evacuation of civilians is continuing. Let's go to our local affiliate in San Juan. Mica Sultan is there. Mica. - Some people are leaving, and still others are hunkered down, hoping that this will all end quietly. But the confusion seems to be growing by the hour. Robert. - We've been told officials are insisting everyone in the evacuation zone must leave. But we're also getting reports of people are stuck at road blocks. What can you tell us? - The highways are jammed, and authorities are asking people to stay put unless they are in the official evacuation zone. As well, they do not want us clogging the phone lines. They know that people will want to call family, however they are requesting that we keep the phone lines open for emergency services. - All right, thank you, Mica. And again, if you are trying to reach family within the evacuation- - [Khalid] Marwan. - There is a Red Cross phone number for you to call. It's right there up on your screen. And authorities are urging everyone to please- (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) - Your accent, Kashmiri, by the border. - You've been there? - I've been everywhere. - No, I don't want to relay through someone on the radio. I just, yeah, put her through direct to me, and let them listen in. Yeah. - [Man] Bring it to me. You need to watch out. - Officer, this is Tom Shea, FBI, I'm the SAC. - I'll notify Alpha. - You okay? - Uh, no my vest took the hit, but it hurts. And security guard's been hit, Manolo Chavez. - Is it bad? - Very. - Now, are you guys in a safe place? - I don't know, but I'm, um, I'm afraid to move him. - You know, officer, I'd like to get you off your radio. Have you, you got a cell phone with you? - Yes, I do. - Okay. I'm gonna give you a number and I'd like you to call me back at that number. Can you do that? - Yes, I can. - Okay. - Got it, hang on. (Zoe groaning) (Zoe sniffling) (phone beeping) (truck engine rumbling) (phone ringing) - [Tom] Now, can you tell me how many guys they got in there? - Mm hm. I saw four, but I heard gunfire at the same time, so I would say at least two more. At least six altogether. - Okay, did you happen to notice how they were armed? - Uh, automatic weapons, grenades. Sure know how to clear place out, huh? What's going on here? - Well, that's, that's just what we're trying to find out. Hey, officer. You're doing good in there, okay? You're doing great. - Uh huh. Listen, I, um, I think he might be dying. - Okay, listen. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna put you on with a medic, and he's going to give you some things that you can do for him, okay? Can you do that? - [Zoe] Yes I can. - Now, I'm here any time you want me, all right? Have you got a family we can call? - Don't tell my mother. She'll try and come get me herself. - Hey, you know what? Sounds like we've got the same. (light dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) (flag rustling) (speaking foreign language) (bomb beeping) (light switch clicking) - Well, NRC issued a statement saying that if there is a meltdown, containment will hold. - That true? - I don't care if it's true. I got 16 highway deaths. I got looters in Pomona. I've got a mother and kids nearly suffocated trying to seal themselves up inside a room. If the statement keeps people calm it's fine with me. - Yeah. - Got an address from a rental agency going now. And I think they're in there without you. - Agent Ritchie, I need everything you got in the tent. Two minutes. - Do we have time? - No, sir. - The sooner we move, the better our chances are at containing this whole thing. - Listen, we have name, we have an address. It doesn't make sense to move before we know what's going on. - We know what's going on. - You said the name was fake. - Yeah, they left it for a reason. If these guys wanted to blow the fuel, we'd all be choking on radioactive dust by now. These guys want something. - If the CAG team is ready to go- - Yeah, no, no, I'm not saying kill the raid. I'm just saying hold back until we at least get a sense of who these guys are. - They're Arab terrorists in a nuclear power plant. How much more do we need? - [Tom] Well, if- - How long are you asking for? - [Utley] I wanna know why he's asking. - We need to go in immediately. - If CAG on sight is willing to take responsibly- - Did you put it up? - Yeah. - Okay, good, good work. This is security footage that just came in. Have a look. - [Zutrow] Hm, how long does this feed go on? - Uh, they cut it when they get to the security station. - Colonel, are you going to need time to study this? - We will, but it looks like it already confirms everything we know; weapons, training- - They're wearing masks. - What? - In every report the terrorists and on the tape, they're wearing masks. Suicide bombers don't hide their faces. These guys have an agenda. If CAG goes in, they're gonna blow the place. If we wait, maybe we'll find out what it is. - How long do you feel we need to- - Sorry it interrupt. Carlton Mansfield, NRC. - Ah. - Agent Shea. - Yeah, join the joy, please. - Colonel Boggs, Special Agent in command. Why don't you have a seat over here. - Mansfield, we've got the records on the plant. And have you guys even run a full security test since 9/11? - We've run tests. - Scenarios or actual simulations on the ground? - We are to code. - Yeah, to code. With costumes and three hostiles and giving the plant six months warning code. - And they still fail half the time. - Less than half, and that's how we- - Okay, hey, hey, guys. What are we looking at? Bottom line, worst case, what are we looking at? - We're working up current numbers now. But we ran a containment breach scenario in '81, 50 mile contamination zone. Health defects, 910,000 people. Within a few miles of the plant, we get maybe 130,000 prompt fatalities. - Population's doubled since '81. - Police are reporting incidents of widespread panic throughout Southern California. Convenience stores and all night supermarket shelves have been stripped bare. Authorities are urging all those outside the immediate evacuation area to remain calm and inside their homes. As assurances now come from official sources about the safety of nuclear power plants to withstand this sort of crisis, with us now from Cambridge is Dr. Jim Walsh of Harvard University. Dr. Walsh, thank you for being here. - Thank you, Robert. - Dr. Walsh, what are the consequences of a meltdown? - Well, a meltdown by any definition would be horrific. We have some experience with Chernobyl. If a meltdown happens, what that means is that there will be radioactive debris that is lifted up into the atmosphere and carried for miles and miles. Certainly, the folks around the plant, the workers, the emergency responders, will face the greatest risk. But others will face risks as well. And then there are other economic, psychological consequences, and of course, consequences for the nuclear power industry. So it's something we want to avoid at all costs. - This is something the United States has never dealt with before. - Nothing quite like this. Of course, there was Three Mile Island. But never have we had a terrorist attack on a nuclear power plant. And so we are in uncharted territory right now. - Uh, I'm sorry, Dr. Walsh. I gotta cut in here for a minute. We are getting reports of a broadcast to, hang on. A webcast? Okay, we are now getting reports of a broadcast via the internet. This is coming in live. It is raw footage. We don't know what to expect here. It appears to be from those inside the control room at the San Juan Plant. - They're saying it's a internet access on a prepaid mobile phone, server somewhere in Croatia. - [Khalid] If you should die or be slain in the cause of god, his mercy and his forgiveness would surely be better than all riches. You see where we are. - [Tom] That's straight from the Quran. - [Khalid] You see how easy it was. So we ask you, are you afraid? Because today, America, it is the day you should fear. (muffled talking) - [Tom] What's going on? - There's blueprints, manuals, plans, photographs all over the place. It's not San Juan, but it seems familiar. With a lot of Arabic notes. We've got a translator flying it. - Well, shoot it and leave it to me. - We will, but we got a lot of stuff here. - [Tom] Yeah, why did they leave it? Why leave it for us to find? - Maybe they didn't care. - No, they care, they care. You got neighbors? - [Jansen] We're in an evac zone. Looks like the parking lot at a Dead concert out there. We're looking. - Well, find out who owns the building. - [Jansen] I got a lead on the super. - And in addition to their disturbing message, terrorists inside San Juan Nuclear broadcast disturbing video images showing just how easy it was for them to take over one of our nation's nuclear power plants. Jim Walsh is still with us from Cambridge. When you look at all of this today, Dr. Walsh, how has this all changed since the events of September 11th? - Well, there has been change. And some of it, a lot of it has been for the better. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission I think was slow to respond at first. But eventually, February after 9/11, issued orders requiring nuclear power plants to upgrade their security. I think there were changes. There are positive changes. The NRC was taking the threat of terrorism seriously. But the question was speed of action. It's not simply acting. It's acting quick enough. And we'll have to wait and see whether they acted quickly enough in this case. - And I'm sure there'll be plenty of debate on that in the coming weeks and months ahead. But I'm sure you also understand that at present, our focus is entirely on the situation at hand. So we're gonna go back now to Mica Sultan, who is live at the San Juan Nuclear Plant. Mica, the video images the terrorists broadcast included footage of a truck. It was seemingly packed with explosives and positioned in a very specific part of the power plant. Near, what I am told, are these spent nuclear fuel pools. So what can you tell us about that? - Apparently the area where they keep the spent nuclear fuel is designed to withstand an earthquake of up to 7.0. However, no one knows exactly how it would handle a bomb detonated right at its center. I'm told that an explosion here would create a plume of radioactive steam that could affect people across the entire southwest. One expert said that we could be looking at a catastrophe on par with Chernobyl. - And Chernobyl, of course, which we spoke of earlier, was the Russian nuclear reactor that burned for several days back in 1986, poisoning an area roughly the size of Kentucky. In addition to the explosive laden truck, of course, we heard disturbing words, words from the Quran. - [Khalid] If you should die or be slain in the cause of God, his mercy and his forgiveness would surely be better- - How dare you desecrate the Quran. You think your police give you the right to hurt people? It's an affront to Allah. - I'm not hurting people. I'm saving them. - You are a weak man who grabs power to make yourself feel stronger. - I have fought for my people. I have killed for my people, I have watched my brothers die, and it has changed nothing. Today, we will make things change. (Manolo panting) - [Zoe] It's all right. (Manolo gasping) (Manolo exhaling) (Zoe gasps) - [Khalid] You see where we are. You see how easy it was. - Well, he sounds educated. - Still working on the accent. - Still, you got a region? Well how about a country? - They're debating. - You know, it feels like Syrian, but that's not quite it. And Al-Qaeda doesn't issue statements during events. So maybe we're dealing with someone else. Like Abu Sayyaf, Jemaah Islamiyah. - Shit, there's over 30 organizations on the states hot foreign terror list. - Some of the guys jumped in. That's new. That takes sophisticated training. Does any of the groups in the hot list have operatives with that kind of profile? - No, there's very little human intel on any of these cells. - We got anything on the plane? - The FAA says the plane went down in the ocean due west. Flight originated in Mexico. But private aircraft, no flight plan, working on a recovery. But that's, that's a couple of days off. - Can we control his communications? - We found his server. We shut down his IP address. That should keep him off for a while. - Any luck on the face? - No it's in shadow. He knows exactly what he's doing. (speaking foreign language) He wants us to know they're ready for us. They know our protocols. Pull anyone on the hot sheets that has US training. See what that turns up. - [Ritchie] Yes, sir. (light dramatic music) (Velcro ripping) (Zoe panting) (keyboard clicking) - Would you please let him turn his cell phone on to call his wife? Just to talk to her for a minute? - Thanks. (Chuck sighs) (phone beeping) (phone ringing) Hello? It's for him. (speaking foreign language) (phone clicking) - Gone. - Let's try to get him back. - Well, he said we'd speak again later. That's a good sign. - Unless he's just buying time. - No, these guys don't buy time. The average terrorist incident is over inside of three minutes. We all know that. Something else is going on here. - My CAG teams can get in there, control these guys, put an end to this. - Yeah, I know you wanna send your guys in. I heard you. - You think my first move is to send my guys in to get shot at every time? It's my last move, every time. I'd love to stand back, keep my guys safe, and let the FBI wait it out or screw it up. But I don't believe we have that luxury here. - No, we don't. They've been one step ahead of us at every turn. I'd like to catch up before we move. - Sir, it's your officer inside. - [Tom] Officer Cox, you okay? - Listen, he's dead. So, um- - I'm sorry. - My chest is really hurting. I think I might have some internal bleeding. - That, that hit may have cracked some ribs. - I'm having a hard time breathing. - Well, you know, I tell you what. I took a hit in the vest on time, and I mean, it hurts like a son of a bitch. But it's, it's not gonna kill you. I can promise you that. - Okay. Sorry. - Hey, hey, no, you're doing great out there, officer. It's just, I just want you to get someplace safer and to keep your cell phone on for me and turn it on to silent, if you haven't already. - No, I don't, I don't wanna leave him here. - He would want you to protect yourself. Wouldn't he? - Listen, my partner was just there outside the gates. - He's fine. (Zoe sighs) - Okay, thanks. - You may kill someone simply because that person will, that his death or her death will produce a political effect, which is useful for your particular cause. - What do you think fuels terrorism? - What fuels terrorism is hope, not discontent, not hatred. It's hope of success. - All right, Professor Rapoport. I do wanna come back and ask you more about the thinking of these terrorists. But right now we have just been informed that throughout Asia and Europe all financial markets have suspended trading at this hour. The entire world focused on the nuclear power plant on the coast of Southern California. - We're already getting reports from emergency rooms with people who think they've got radiation sickness as far away as Arizona. - Guy in Riverside thought we were being invaded. Shot two of his neighbors. I think we should send in the guard. - Can't do it, already stretched too thin. - The NRC says potential damage is way outside the five mile zone. Shouldn't we start at least evacuating more people? Get them the hell out of there? - Evacuate 25 million people with what, 24 hours notice? You wanna run some logistics on that? - Even if we could, do you want to send the message that half a dozen terrorists can affect the lives of this many people? - They have affected the lives of this many people. - You want more panic? What if we suddenly find ourselves with 25 million refugees? - All we can do is tell everyone they're safe and then pray to God it's true. People find out the real risks, we'll have thousands dead in the panic. - NRC just came in with some new numbers. Have a listen. - Go. - We've got a wind blowing off shore. Our weather people say it should hold a couple of hours, at least. Get a RAD cloud during that window, we're looking at vastly reduced casualties. - Numbers. - Well, that should depend on- - Mansfield, plain-English. - Offshore wind, 150 to 200,000 prompt fatalities. Onshore wind, 500 to 750. Right now, the wind's in our favor. - We go in now, we reduce our worst case numbers by 75%. We wait, wind shifts, numbers go back up. - Yeah, but these guys will spot it. They've been inside five hours. All they've done is lock us out and broadcast online. You know, they're leaving really easy to follow clues. Al-Qaeda, they're not using the Al-Qaeda playbook. Our best guys still can't figure out their accents. The guy, Khalid, just told me we're gonna talk later. That gives us time. - And we're supposed to trust him? He could be trying to melt the core right now. - And if he is and we could've gotten in and stopped it. - Well, yeah, but this is it. Are they or aren't they? 'Cause we've got two nightmares here. Either they blow the spent fuel or they melt the core. And if they're melting, yeah, we go in. We take the risk on the fuel bomb and we try and stop them. If they're not, we don't wanna piss 'em off. We wanna know who they are. Now, I mean, are there, are there gauges like not in the control room that will tell us if they're trying to melt. - Sure, but they're all inside the plant. - I got a pair of eyes inside. - I'm right here. - Yeah, so, if you look west now- - Mm hm. - You got an idea of where west is? Yeah, you're gonna see to your right a whole long section of pipes. You wanna follow that section of pipes about 50 yards. - Okay. - [Tom] You can do this. (light dramatic music) - [Jansen] Are you the building super? - [Building Super] Yeah. - [Jansen] What can you tell me about apartment 5-D? - There's a bunch of Arab guys staying there. But the Khalid guy pays the rent. - You run a credit check on the rental? - He paid cash. First, last, security... Look can um, we do this in the morning? I kinda got something going on here, you know? - It's sorta time sensitive. Anything else? Vehicles, girls? - Saw him at Scarlet's once. Tried to hide, got all embarrassed. Girls are against his religion or something. - Scarlet's? - Yeah, the strip club. I think that Khalid guy was seeing one of the dancers. - Some Islamic fundamentalist, huh? Mind if I come inside? (suspenseful music) - [Zoe] All right. - That's it. - [Zoe] I think I see it here. - Yeah, this route, Zoe, it's the long way around, okay? But it's gonna get you past most of the security cameras. You can do this. - Okay. - Isolated reports of looting have come in from Los Angeles and San Diego as airports across the nation have been shut down, and hospital emergency rooms are flooded with patients fearing they have radiation poisoning. We have been told definitively that there has been no radiation detected in that area, and that the five mile evacuation in progress is strictly a preventative precautionary measure. Mica Sultan is on the ground now in San Juan, and can tell us how the evacuation is going. Mica. - It is just after midnight and the 405 is a parking lot. And it's the same story for the 10, the 110, and the 710. Nothing is moving. - Thank you, Mica. We are now taking you live to Washington DC, where we are told that Homeland Security Secretary Frank Utley is speaking with reporters outside the situation room at the... Do we have that feed? We do. Homeland Security Secretary Frank Utley. - Oh, I think the best thing is for everybody to stay calm and stay put. - [Reporter] Is there, is there a danger of a meltdown? - No, no, in order for there to be, as you say, a meltdown, it would require the simultaneous failure of two separate cooling systems, and that's simple not- - Mr. Utley. - Yes? - [Reporter] Just how safe is it in the immediate vicinity? - Well, a containment dome is built to contain. And even this five mile evacuation is considered by many of our experts to be overly cautious. Uh, we are of course- - This is not true. They know you can dump the water and the spent fuel. - You said yourself, they know. See if they warn the people. (reporters talking over each other) - [Frank] Ladies and gentlemen, that's all the questions- (speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) (bomb beeping) (suspenseful music) - Still nothing from your officer inside? - Not yet, no. - Colonel Boggs, your team's ready to go? - They are, sir. - We cannot go in while we- - It was a good play, Shea. It really was. But we can't wait. - We're not gonna just stand by. - We're not just standing by. We have someone on the inside. - Decision's been made. Colonel Boggs, send them in. (light dramatic music) - [Soldier] 06 this is 21 Alpha. Baseline one clear. Moving forward. Out. (light dramatic music) (static buzzing) 06 this is 21 Alpha. Breach general perimeter. Out. (Geiger counter beeping) Hold up. They're getting readings. Pull back. The zone's hot. We're pulling back. Back! - 12 o'clock. - Let's move. - It's radioactive. They're getting RAD readings. - It's melting. - [Man] We gotta help 'em. (camera clicking) (helicopter whirring) - Satellite surveillance says it's clean. Didn't pick up a thing. - What, CAG gets radiation on the ground, and the satellite says it's not here? - We're trying to figure it out. Give us 10 minutes, and I'll give you a new action response. (phone ringing) - Jansen, what do you got there? - Not much. - Well, it's getting pretty hot down here. - You holding up? - CAG tried going in, and they got RAD readings. And the satellite aren't picking up any readings. So nobody knows what the hell's going on. - Oh, man. - Listen, I need somebody up in Sacramento that I can trust to deal with the guys in DC. I want you to chopper up there. Okay? Bring Charlotte and Jess if you can find her. - Tom. - 'Cause I need someone I can trust up there. - [Jensen] I think you need me here. - I don't need you here. Look, if something happens, I don't want you here. - I'm not leaving. I've got your back. I'll have a composite for you any minute. - If this happens, we'll need to quarantine the area. That means a military perimeter. - Well, how many people are we talking about fencing in? - Is the wind still with us? - The weather people say that it is. - They've asked us to prepare possible responses. - Working on it. - International responses. After 9/11, we hit Afghanistan with about 10% of US power. Iraq, about 20. We get nuked, and the Arab world may have to see a proportional response; nuclear. President wants to have that option. I'll be back as soon I have TC on our subs off the coast of Yemen. They're spinning the missiles. They want them hot and ready. (dramatic music) (phone ringing) (keyboard clicking) - [Khalid] The more people you send in, the more people will die. - Are your hostages all right? - [Khalid] It seems we have quite a few of you hostage. - [Tom] Yeah, yeah, you do. You want to share why that is? - [Khalid] You don't know? - You're showing your strength. - [Khalid] Showing your weakness. Using your technology against you, just like before. Showing how your government fails you, safe in bunkers, leaving all of you exposed. They don't care about you. They only care about themselves. - He's on the air. He's on the air. Shut him down. - We can't shut him down. - Set up on a duplicate server. - Figure it out and shut him down. - Shea, get him off the line. - Well, you've certainly got everyone's attention here. - [Khalid] I hoped I would. - But for what? I mean, you're obviously very smart. You're very committed. - [Khalid] They teach you to flatter like that in the academy? - It doesn't mean it isn't true. - [Khalid] Sounds like you have some others who need flattering over there. - You know, I'm talking to you. I'm not talking to them. - [Khalid] I want people to see how America lies to them. Says they're safe, all the while they- (static buzzing) - He's off. - [Khalid] You cut my broadcast. You cut my broadcast! Get it back up. - Go! (door slamming) - [Agent] Federal agents, stay where you are. - Clear. - Federal agents, you're under arrest. Come on, get up. Right now. - Yeah, so you're on your way, then. Yeah, good. No, no, no. No, just take the, yeah take the freeway and use my badge, and yeah, yeah. That'd be nice. That'd be, yeah make a fire. What's happening with the reactor- No, it's just... And our guys still, they still can't place the guys accent. It's been, Jess? Jesse? Jess? (muffled police radio) (siren wailing) Hey. - Sorry, sir. Your CHP officer's on. - Thanks, got it. Zoe, you near the gauges? - I think so, almost. - And how are you doing? - Okay, a bit better now that I got something to do. How about you? - Oh, well, they haven't demoted me yet. - Like that's gonna happen. - Oh, it wouldn't be the first time. - You? - Yeah, I was on the USS Cole bombing in Yemen. Trace fibers matched DNAs, got two of the cell heads in custody. Had more leads, then they shut us down. Then the terrorists walked, and the ambassador cared more about playing politics than getting the bad guys. - So, how'd that get you demoted? - Before I left the country, I might have punched someone out a little. (light dramatic music) - Okay. I think I'm here. Okay. I'm here and I'm going in. - Zoe, I'm going to put you on with Mike Krinsky. Mike, Mike, it's Zoe. He's gonna walk you through this. Put her on the com, would you? - [Mike] Hello, Zoe? - Hello. - Uh, okay. Where you are, there are two rows of gauges. - Okay. Yeah, two, two rows. I see 'em, I'm right in front of 'em. - Okay, start reading me the information on the first one on the bottom left. It's labeled Core Temp. - Okay, hang on. Okay. Core Temp. It's, um, it's green. It says normal. That's, that's good, right? - That's great. Just what we wanna see. Just above that? - Yeah, um, Turbine Trip and Reactor Trip. And they're both green, and there's um, Primary Feed Loop, but it's way below the red. - I need you to find Reactor Pressure. You see that? Right below the last one you read. - Okay. But I, I, I can't see it. The glass is totally clouded over. What do you want me to do? Is it safe to break the glass? - It's not gonna affect the system, but it will send an alarm to the security station. - Agent Shea. - Hi, Zoe, hi. Yeah, it's me. Listen, some of our guys got in close, and they got some RAD readings, right? But the satellites are not picking that up. Now, we're making some big decisions here, and they're really riding on whether or not the reactor is bleeding. - Okay. So I break it, read it, and get out. Right? (light dramatic music) Okay, I'm gonna do this. (glass shattering) (alarm beeping) (speaking foreign language) It looks like it's about 1,100 PSI. - 1,100? Way below normal. Everyone, the reactor's cooling down. - So they're not melting it? They're not doing anything to it? - Absolutely stable. - All right, alert DC. - Sir, I got it. I picked up radio calls. I think they found her. - Zoe, you gotta move. - Okay. (dramatic music) - [Sam] Nine hours into the crisis. And as we await news from the power plant, the toll of the dead and injured in panic across the country continues to grow. Looting in Los Angeles and San Diego counties has escalated into full blown rioting, and violence continues to erupt around the nation. - Terrible to hear, Sam. We're also getting reports now of violence as far away as Baltimore, where, according to our reports from a local affiliate, a mini riot, if you will, has broken out as police are trying to hold back crowds who are storming stores for supplies there. And meanwhile, all the world can do is watch and wait to see what will happen next at the San Juan Nuclear Plant. - So how could their tags go positive if there isn't radiation? - Are you questioning my guys? - No, I'm asking. Look, you made your best call. If I was in your shoes, I would have done the same thing. - No, you wouldn't have. - You know, whatever goes on in DC, it's you and me here. So even if we live through this, they could still hang our asses out to dry if they need to. So the tags, I mean, is there something that can make them turn? - There's an iodine isotope that special ops uses in training that can trigger these meters without radiation. - So somebody uses them in the field, they can't tell. They'd pull out? - They're trained to pull out when the meters turn red. - Well, who can get their hands on the training isotope? - That's not easy. It's totally classified. - [Jansen] Khalid's stripper friend, we got her here. - Copy that. - Like I was saying, totally classified. (dramatic music) (Zoe panting) - If you don't tell me everything you know, you're gonna spend the rest of your life in a cell on Guantanamo. - I don't know. - That's not good enough. - We met in the club a few months ago. I felt sorry for him. - Sorry? (stripper sighs) - He was sick, cancer. So I sleep with him to make him feel better. It's not a crime. - Hm. What kind of cancer? - Syndrome, he called it, from Afghanistan. Uranium in the bomb shells, he said. - What, he talked about Afghanistan? Did he talk about training on small bases or fighting for the Taliban? - Taliban? No, for this country. - Khalid's an American soldier? - Of course. But, Khalid? This is Eddy, Eddy Sands. - He's a decorated officer. - What country? - The US of A. Major Edward Sands, Delta Force. I'm betting they're all vets, his whole team. Our terrorist is GI Joe. (dramatic music) - While celebrations continue across the Middle East, offers of help are flooding into the White House. Canada and Mexico are working in cooperation with our military to secure the borders. We also have reports that Israeli jets are on their way, carrying hundreds of thousands of potassium iodide tablets from Israel's own stockpiles. Potassium iodide is believed to be the most effective medication to protect against radioactive poisoning. FEMA, facing a critical shortage, will now route those pills to areas throughout Southern California. - He's got a Silver Star with oak leaf cluster for bravery, two Purple Hearts, trained in anti-terror. He grew up in Fort Wayne. - Why all the Al-Qaeda leads? I don't get it. - Well, for some reason they want us to believe they're Arab terrorists. Your guess is as good as mine. - How the hell do we have highly decorated soldiers in there posing as Arab terrorists? - Well, Sands and his guys were early into Afghanistan. The rumor is they had Bin Laden cornered, and they got word to lead a convoy through to let them escape. And it was some part of a State Department deal for access to air bases in Pakistan. He was there, he reported it through channels. He got reprimanded. That kinda thing that change a man. - You're justifying him? - I understand him. The terrorists that walked when they shut down our investigation in Yemen, I think about them every day. How are they gonna come back? Biological, chemical, a nuclear plant? I think he's trying to make a point. That's why the reactor's stable. - Do we have IDs on all of them? - They all served under Sands in Delta. - All diagnosed with cancer in the last two years. Depleted uranium syndrome from our own munitions. - That goes public, could get ugly. - We have reports that American fighter jets have been scrambled in the Persian Gulf, and US battleships are already on the move in the Middle East. We are told that the United States military has declared an official defense emergency, meaning that an overt attack has been or is being made upon the United States. All military forces are on high alert and prepared to act. - Where are we on their broadcast capabilities? - We got 'em shut down for now. - Yeah, but he's smart. He's going to come right back up again. - How do we end this thing? - You know, I think the truck is riding too high for the weight of real explosives. I think the bomb's a fake. - They can't blow anything up. - And we've been here for 11 hours. We sit it out another day and a half, the reactor will be cool and nothing will go off- - In 11 hours, we've had 115 confirmed deaths, more injured, shooting, looting, this is breaking down. - Mr. Shea, this country cannot afford to wait another day and a half. (dramatic music) - Okay, let's do it. - We'll start now. (dramatic music continues) (light dramatic music) (Jesse sighs) - Jess? Jess? - Uh, I'm sorry. - Nothing to be sorry for, everything to be proud of. - I, I can't make it. I know I'm letting you down. - We're here. Whatever else happens, we did this thing. - I know. - You're a great soldier, Jesse. (Jesse gasping) - I'm a dead soldier. - We all are. We're combat dead. Don't forget that. - You know, I don't even mind getting the cancer. All I ever wanted to do was, was fight. - Come on. (Jesse groaning) (dramatic music) (Jesse groaning) How are you doing? - I'm okay, sir. - Not long, now. (dramatic music) - [Soldier] Go! (Zoe sighs) (static buzzing) (speaking foreign language) (bomb beeping) (dramatic music) - Marwan, you left your sector. - Couldn't raise Jesse on the radio. - He's not doing so good. How about you? - Yeah, well I'm ready to die. - Go back to your post. We're gonna end this thing soon. - End it? What do you mean? What do you mean end it? - Make the broadcast, let people know what we did. Walk out of here and get Jesse some help. - We're not walking out of here. - I'll stay until you guys are out. - We die here today. You know that, Khalid. - Okay, listen, Zoe, we've got guys coming in. I need to know where you are so I can pull you out of there. - I'm on my way out. - I need you to work your way around the back perimeter. Where are you? - Primary pump LB2N. (bomb beeping) - Zoe? - Hang on. I think I see something. - [Tom] Okay, just tell me what you see. Zoe? What do you see? (Zoe groaning) - I don't know. It looks like an explosive device. It's black, it's taped to the side of the pipe. - That's the primary pump system. If they've set one of these on the secondary system as well, and they blow them both, it's gonna meltdown. (gunshots banging) Zoe? Zoe! (light dramatic music) Boggs! - He says it's already happening. There's no way to stop it. - We get full clearance. - Go through! - That's a go. - [Soldier] On my cue. - How long before we're up again? - We'll have you online in three minutes. - What the, who are you people? - American soldiers. - You're militia? - No, we're... Imagine someone had hijacked the planes before 9/11 and flown them past the towers. - That's what this is? A warning? All this for that? - All of this for that. A lot of people could have died tonight. Why? Nuclear power plants, chemical plants, container ships, water supplies all vulnerable while we confiscate tweezers from grandmother's. Nothing changes until people are afraid. (phone ringing) Time to end this. (phone beeps) Yes? - Major Edward Sands, we have a problem. - Let us explain ourselves. We have no problem. - You need to tell me about the bombs. - The reactor is safe. The truck is a- - Not the truck, that's a dummy. I know. The bombs on the pumping system. - There are no bombs on the pump system. - Where's Boggs? - They're moving, they can't be stopped. - Pull him back. Listen, you have bombs at the primary pumping station. - You got a reason to draw my men out there? - It's there. Listen, I just lost an officer who was staring at it. Now you need to tell me exactly what's going on. (suspenseful music) - One of my men. When we pulled up the plans, he was looking for the pumps. I'll deal with him. - No, you can't just take care of it. If both pumps blow, the reactor is gonna meltdown. Now, you need to tell me what is going on. - Marwan. His name is Raul Lida. He was held by Pakistani extremists for three years. Who knows what happened. - Well, they turned him. - I'll deal with him. - Listen, our guys are not gonna trust you to deal with it. We have guys going in there. You need to get your guys' to stand down. - If he set those bombs, I don't know why he waited till now. But he sees CAG coming in, he'll blow it. - [Tom] Listen, when you see me, just get your guys to open the gates. (dramatic music) (bomb beeping) - Why hasn't it already been detonated? What are they waiting for? - They must be waiting for a coordinated event. - [Man] We got an FBI agent at the main gate. - I sure hope to God he knows what he's doing. (suspenseful music) - [Man] Team leaders, stand down. FBI agent entering main gate. End message. Repeat, team leaders, stand down. FBI agent entering main gate. End message. (static buzzing) - Let him pass. - [Man] It's Bravo leader, I copy. - [Man] Delta leader, roger that. (light dramatic music) - On his own, he just went in? - He's got no authority. I want that on the record. - There is no record, Susan. - This changes nothing. We're still going in. - Secretary Utley, he's Special Agent in charge. We can't just let the CAG team go in there- - You're the one to let him walk in there. He knows what's happening. If he gets hit, he gets hit. - I've been working with the man all night. He's been right every step of the way. If he says we're in trouble, I trust him. Bottom line. (light dramatic music) - Where is he? - Primary pump system. - Can we get in there? - No. He'll feel us coming. Backup system's gotta be wired, too. - We'll go there. - Come on, try him again. - [Jansen] Shea, come in. - He's the federal agent in charge of this operation. He's on the inside. - You put it off, it's daylight there. Then what? - Sir! - Decisions done, Colonel. Get it done now. - Yes, sir. (light dramatic music) - Listen, you know this guy. Tell me why he waited. Why didn't he just blow it the minute he wired the pipes? I mean, is there a chance he doesn't wanna do it? - I don't know. - Well, we, we need to know. We need to know what the hell... (flag pole clanking) (flag rustling) Maximum damage. That's what he was waiting for. - What? - Raul was waiting for the wind. - They're coming. He sees them, he's not gonna wait for the wind. (intense dramatic music) (Tom groaning) Shea. (bomb beeping) - Oh, shit. - It's wrapped with primer cord. Detonator goes off, it'll slice clean through. - What do you need me to do? - I gotta cut the cords, every one. You've gotta hold the detonator extremely still. - Extremely still. - It's a mercury switch. Slightest movement, it blows. - Okay. (beeping continues) What do you think I'm gonna do? Shoot you in the head and then let the bomb go off? (Sands sighs) (gun clanking) - No! Two hands. (Tom panting) Raul. I should have known. He shouldn't have been here. - None of you should have been here. (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (bomb beeping) (beeping continues) (cords snapping) (Sands grunting) (cord snapping) (Sands grunting) (cord snapping) (Tom gasps) (gun clanking) (gunshots banging) (Raul groaning) (Raul grunting) (explosions booming) (building creaking) - We've got a major explosion on the primary pump. The secondary systems appear stable. Repeat, the primary systems are offline. (pipes hissing) (Sands groaning) - I should put a bullet in your head right now. - Go ahead. Cancer, gunshot, meltdown, it doesn't matter. - What are you doing here? - My men and me were poisoned by weapons made of uranium waste from places like this. And Washington just lets it sit here, unprotected, not a word of warning to people. They don't care. Like they didn't care about us in Afghanistan. - You care. - That's why we did it! - All the people that died tonight, in the panic, on the streets! - People die so others can live. It's what we do. - That's what you do! That's what you signed up for. The people out there expect to be protected. - I've been here 11 hours. And what has the government done? A five mile evac? Real terrorists could have killed millions tonight. It was the only way to show them. - What real terrorist wouldn't say that? (dramatic music) (pipes hissing) (water splashing) - Kill the power. Insert Bravo and Delta squad. (helicopter whirring) (lights whooshing) (alarms beeping) - Water's draining from the core. Primary pumps are down. Backup's not coming on. (dramatic music) (alarms beeping) - [Tom] Drop your weapon. Drop your weapon right now. - Lower the weapon. - Are you Shea? - Yeah, what's it doing? - Primary pumps are down. Secondary's not responding. - Soon as they cut the power for the raid. - We're leaking water. It's getting very hot. - We have to get the emergency generators online. - Look, you do what you need to do. (pipes hissing) (water splashing) (lights whooshing) (gunshots banging) (man groaning) (gunshots banging) (gunshot banging) (man groaning) (power whooshing) (gunshots banging) (man groaning) - Where is the generators? - Okay, just wait? Okay, the number one emergency generator has just started. Safety injection pump is online. - I've got it too. It's coming on. - Come on, come on, please. - Okay, the reactor cooling temperature is moving down toward normal. - Okay, pumps are going. Let's secure it. (explosion booming) - [Man] On on the ground! On the ground. Nobody move! - Do not move! (gunshots banging) - I'm FBI, hold your fire. Hold your fire! - You don't understand, the core will explode. - Federal prisoner in custody! - I have to save the injection pump, I have to secure it. - Do not move! No one move! - Please. - He's the engineer! - Please. - Just call command, tell Boggs it's Shea. - The pump, the core is exposed. You've got to let me do this. (gunshots banging) - That's a hostage! God damn it! He's a hostage! - No one move. - You gonna shoot me too? He's my prisoner. Mine. - Forget it, Shea. They're not gonna let me walk out of here. American soldiers doing what we did. We're dead Arab terrorists. That's the story. - You call Boggs. You tell him he's my prisoner, and I'm walking him out of here alive. (light dramatic music) (heartbeat pounding) (Chuck whimpering) (keyboard clicking) (light dramatic music) Just stay close. We're gonna walk out of here. - Shea, it ends here. - Don't. (gunshots banging) (body thudding) (heartbeat pounding) - [Newscaster] At 6:22 a.m. Pacific Standard Time in a daring predawn raid, all seven terrorists were killed, and the San Juan Nuclear Power Plant was secured. According to authorities, the terrorists were part of a fundamentalist Islamic splinter group operating inside the Philippines. At the White House, the President encouraged all Americans to go about their normal lives; work, play, and shop. And the President reiterated his pledge to once again defend the American way of life. - I don't know how it could have happened. Clearly, in this race, the race between the folks who wanna do us harm and the race between us who are trying to improve and defend ourselves from those folks, we appear to have lost this particular battle. There was always a chance that a nuclear power plant could be subject to attack. There was controversy within the intelligence community as to whether it was a real target or not. But I think most of us would have said, would have said, given what Bin Laden had said about symbolic targets and trying to cause economic damage to the US, that it was at least possible, plausible, that a US nuclear power plant would have been attacked. And now I think we're gonna have a lot of what ifs. You know, after the 9/11 disaster, there were hearings and questions were asked. Well, did we do everything we should have done? And the, a lot of the folks who answered those questions said, well, we, we didn't know that they were coming. We didn't have actionable intelligence. Well, you're not gonna be able to say that this time. People knew there was a problem. They simply weren't addressing the problem as completely or as quickly as they should have.
