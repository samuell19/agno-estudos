Nathan! How are you, old friend? - Excellent, thank you. You look like death itself. - I often get cold early in the day. What am I doing here on a Sunday morning at eight o'clock? If you take a look at the movie - - you see that two days ago a heavily guarded facility in Odessa was attacked. 20 guards were coldly liquidated. You must retrieve what was stolen. And find out who the seller is, who the buyer is… - And what it is. - So we don't know, sir? No, that's the mystery. But the intelligence service tells of great interest in the wrong circles. And since the price was 10 billion, we cannot let it remain a mystery. It has been named "The Object". Why not the intelligence service? Ruse de guerre, Nathan. Unconventional warfare. I need a creative, cunning strategist to dismantle this capricious threat. A bike delivery in rush hour traffic. Our official agents would drown in bureaucracy and the clock is ticking. Who will lead the team? - The Usual: Orson Fortune. God damn! The man is an administrative nightmare. He requires private jets for his claustrophobia, vintage wines for his agoraphobia - - and rehabilitation in the Maldives for his cloud phobia! Yes, but when you allowed part of his expenses to go to a mental illness ward - - you created the perfect storm. He is trained to exploit any system. And that is why he is exactly the bike courier you are looking for. Where is he? - Fun enough at a rehabilitation stay. Yes, at your expense, but I can probably haul him in. - What the hell are you doing here? - All is well? No. I have vacation. And you should be 6000 kilometres in that direction. 5000 kilometres in that direction, but never mind. Do you mind if I come in? - Hell yes. Aren't you going to ask what I want? - No, because you're leaving now. It is important. I'll give a shit about that. I have the day off and I don't feel like working. Possessing such a brilliant talent as yours has its price. And don't get me wrong - - but as a private supplier you get a princely salary from the state. I'll pretend you're not here. Travel home. I'm going to meet my boyfriend... At the bar. Your girlfriend, well... I guess she's not just your girlfriend. We fly her home in 1st class. - Have you been spying on me? Yes, you must excuse me, but something rather disgusting has been stolen. How disgusting? Under file A you will find file B, or the list of malicious buyers. Your task is to find out what has been stolen. But we must prevent it from entering the open market. - The danger is imminent. - How imminent? Over-hanging. Once you're there, it's full speed ahead. The plane is waiting, a BBJ, this year's model. And your health needs: 82, 96, 2004... Chew on it and see you in two minutes. Well then, Orson leads the team. And John, the liaison guy? - Unfortunately not. Isn't he the best? - Maybe, but also a double-tongued snake. He has slipped over to Mike Hook's team. - Oh, the competitor. Yeah, and speaking of that: We're not going to be competing against Mike here, are we? The state has more than one security department. Mike is off on another assignment. Excellent, sir. Good day, Lucinda. I was just getting worried. - I had to change. Captain, can we start the engines? - The 82? - It keeps its shape. - Wasn't it my medicine? - Yeah. Thirsty? You party alone as usual? Is it the usual crowd? - No, John has been hijacked. - By whom? - By whom. Forget it. No. I know John. I trust John, he is prof. - Anyone paying better? - Yes. If I asked, would I get more? - You can ask... No. You are above tacky greed. You are a patriot. Besides, no one is treated as well as you. By "you" you probably mean yourself. Who is my helper? - I have the perfect replacement. - What's his name? - Sarah Fidel. Godtnom de guerre. Never heard of him. - She's American. - She... Lucinda, please bring the Haut-Brion 2004. Yes... I grab a beer. I have a fabulous substitute. American. More versatile and creative. - Sarah Fidel. - Wasn't she at Mike's? True to his habit, he left her in Beirut. Where I enlisted her. - More? - Yes, this young man. JJ Davies. Mastering most things. Communication, weapons, cars, diving, slapping, fighting, the whole package. Two versatile helpers. Perfect. JJ? What is he doing here? - He's on the team. Good boy, but a little green, right? - He has been busy since last time. He is what you could call enthusiastic, hungry, eager. Keep your fingers off his mouth. - JJ. - Sir. Mr. Fortune, this is Miss Fidel. - Miss Fidel. - Your Highness. Shall I now be drawn with you? - As long as I don't have to pull for you. Nothing with pee. I'm not into that anymore. John had no personality. I liked John. Just call her John if that makes you feel at ease. - He was reliable. - Not particularly. He was snapped up by my old team. - Old team? The other private supplier your government uses. Did you work for Mike? The competitor? - You may hate Mike, but he's good. What do we know? A bid will land soon with a hard drive. We'll find out where he's going with it. I will keep an eye out and inform. Plays the right music. I control the turntables, you control the dance floor. I like John. - We will send you a bouquet. Can you see anything? - I'm about to connect. Can you hear it? Do you know anything at all about computers? Yes, as long as you say where to turn it on. Nathan, we've been here for three hours now. If she messes up, it's your responsibility. I trust her. We have three hours. He must come soon. Actually... he's here now. - It was about time. The hard drive is inside the crocodile. We don't know what's on it. Orson, remember he is a retired teacher, not a karate master from Mogadishu. I stop scaring the life out of him. - We just need to know who the recipient is. What am I looking for? - Hat, glasses, crocodile leather briefcase. You should see him... now. I'm sending a text now: "The car is late." Can you see him? I'll send him to Luigi's coffee shop. How do you know it's him? - You dance, I play. - Jane, he's coming your way. - In place. Take the second staircase. He's walking past me now. - Roof over. You're still sitting there. Jane? Jane? - So what? - Jane doesn't answer. JJ, eyes on stalks, hands out of pockets. - Eyes on stalks, hands completely free. Marcia, catch him at the counter. Confirm when the transmitter is in place. - Going now. - I sense owls in the bog. - Ditto here. Marcia, confirm the transmitter is in place. Marcia, Marcia, Marcia! Confirm that the transmitter is in place. I guess we're not the only team. - Impossible. I wanted to know that. Weird. Either there is an error in the connection, or someone is really skilled. And it is rarely the connection. Who can do such a thing? John. John can do something like that. Team B. Nathan, what the hell are they doing here? If renegade John is here, so is Mike. Please wait. Nathan. - Mike isn't on another assignment, is he? Or does his team just happen to be in Madrid? If so, it's not for my department. The state likes to see competition between the departments. "Competition breeds competence." Mike has only two talents: He exposes himself and sucks himself. Orson, confirmed. Mike is here to shadow the crocodile. Mike is too clumsy for that. They will nab him. We are live again. JJ, new strategy. Not in, but out. Output F, pliers. Understood. - There are two behind you. - Understood. Say they didn't use stun guns on the girls. Yep, stun guns. - Then I would like some music. Count down. - Three, two, one... Take a deep breath. He is heading for the exit. Two men follow him. On the way out now. Gracias. He walks towards a taxi. 49502. Nathan, you are needed. JJ, position? - Exit east. Señor? Hola, señor. - No, I can't come. Two more in the car. - Mr. Hills? - Excuse me, señor? My heart... JJ, you're driving. - What's wrong with him? - I do not know. He says something about the heath. - Loosen his tie. He doesn't feel warm. - He has a heart condition. Two cars behind us. The hard drive is encrypted, but I can copy it from here. They are blocking the way. - They are threatening to kill my wife. Lock the doors, JJ. There are ten of them. Heavily armed. Get out of the car! I need 20 more seconds. They don't know what I look like. Go to The Duchess. Table 12 noon 18. Save my wife! Four... ...three... two... Shut up! Done! We need a shovel. - Nathan. - Mike. Thanks for knocking. - Orson. - Mike. The one that probably belongs to me. What have you done to him? - You scared the life out of him. It's fine, sir. Mouse number two always gets the cheese. Take off! We can't get into the hard drive without the encryption key- - so the best option is to deliver the disk and find out who the buyer is. No one of interest has appeared in the past 40 minutes, so the ones you are going to meet- - is already there. Now. It says, you're terrible at accents, so shut up. Hills? Is it for me? Have a good evening. I have him. A... Ben Harris. Ben Harris... Greg Simmonds' attorney and adviser. Who is Greg Simmonds? - Billionaire and arms dealer. Selling 9mm guns to children and helicopter gunships to terrorists. Impossible to catch. He only uses Ben Harris for big trades, so this speaks for itself. There might be something here. Greg is doing some charity hall in Cannes. Fine, we're going there too. Burning for orphans. - He has made many of them. We've caught up a bit so we land in I.A. in just under four hours. I.A.? When I went to bed we were on our way to the South of France. So can someone explain why we are heading to Los Angeles? - The strength of saying no. - What have you? Backward to move forward. We have to pick up our invitation in I.A. - And it is? - Danny Francesco. Danny Francesco? The movie star? Before hell! I do the stunts, you film! So wake up! Get out of the car, Chad! Greg Simmonds' favourite movie star Danny Francesco. How does it help us? - Standard baiting will not do here. Greg dreams of what he can't have. He can buy anything but Danny Francesco - — who turned down $10 million to jump out of his birthday cake. He is obsessed with celebrities, but even more so with their partners. Sarah plays Danny's girlfriend. The fish that cannot be caught. The power of saying no. And how do we get the movie star to change his mind? - I think we have something here. - Blackmail? Yes, extortion. - Ruse de guerre... Fine. Continue. I dug up some dirt on film producer Saul Goldstein - - so he agreed to lure Danny to Vegas with the promise of a five-film contract. But we want to go to Greg's charity hall, so you ask Danny to come with us instead. How inventive. What do we have on Danny Francesco? He is having an affair with his sister-in-law. I told you she was good. I'll fix it. Shut up, then... Swedish? You're too much, Saul. You are an excellent producer… An arsehole, but excellent. Everyone wants to work with you, including me. But Swedish accent, Saul? I'm American! Hi Natasha. You are not needed today. - Does not? - You know how it is... I understand, Danny. But you must do it for our sake. Our fault? Do you now use majestic plural? - You must do it for our sake. - Must? Not to contradict you, Saul, but I don't have to. Not to contradict you, Danny, but we all have to do our part. Excuse me, but aren't you here to serve coffee? Why does it feel like it's two against one? - Who are you? - Your new manager. Sorry, kid. They have a crush on me too. Where are you going, Saul? I'll let you chat with your new manager. It will be OK. You are a star. - Saul... Where are you going...? - See you. You dare not... Natasha! Where is Natasha? Who let him on my plane? Natasha! It's my plane! - Yes, Danny. And it's a nice plane. But trust me, for two minutes. Why? - You are a movie star. A professional. Imagine we are rehearsing a scene. Please sit down. - Are you a patriot? - I'm not a Republican. Okay, let me put it this way: The world needs you in the biggest role of your life. The two of us are going to a party. Who are you? - Your manager. Charlie Rosewood. And Vegas is cancelled. We are going to Cannes. No, you have to get off my plane. Natasha makes sure of that. Natasha? What the hell have you done to Natasha? - Please fall down. You have a sensitive and awkward relationship with your sister-in-law. You probably shouldn't have filmed it. I love my sister-in-law. - Yes, it is clearly stated. Everyone thinks you're a superstar. They contacted us immediately when they heard you were coming. No, stop. I don't think I can. - Danny, you have to trust yourself. There is no need to be nervous. - Does not? They are murderers. We've seen you deal with killers on film. - Basically, it's the same. What do agents do? They pretend. And no one is better at it than you. The best agents are stars, the best actors are movie stars. I guess there is something to that. - You are an actor. Game. A movie star is something else entirely. - And that's why they love you so much. Yes, and then because I said no to jumping out of a $10 million cake. Okay. And while I play my part, what are you two going to do? We need to get close to Greg Simmonds and connect to his mobile. Okay, I'm ready. Let's get rolling. COLLECTION FOR THE BENEFIT OF WAR ORPHANS We are in place. Well. Remember: You don't have to buy anything. I hardly need to remind you - - that you spent the entire annual budget on wine on the flight. So drop the wine, focus on Greg's cell phone, and find out who the buyer is. Understood. Danny, everything alright? - Well? Is it a joke? You're a pro. You're playing yourself. - But I've never played myself... - You can do it. - Danny. Item No. 4, a set of diamond and sapphire earrings- -which went to Jonathan Mendes for $258,000. He was diagnosed with… What is the name of that funny cancer? - Is there a funny cancer? I can't think of it, but something a la cock cancer and he… - Can someone squeeze my arm? - Pinch you? I think I'm dreaming. Is it...? Is that Danny Francesco? Now I'm getting a little excited... I love Danny Francesco. - Everyone loves Danny Francesco. I'm a little starstruck. Embarrassing, but I am. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Hello. - Danny, do you like this? Lovely. Expenses due to "mental illness" are one thing, running the department down is another. What is he doing here? Are you behind it, Benjamin? Innocent, Mr. Simmonds. - Was it you two? - A surprise, sir. How much does the adorable case cost? Item number 15, $1.5 million. Number 15, from the Habsburg collection. Do you like it? - It is beautiful. 1.5 million? What Danny buys, he pays for himself. He likes it. - You don't, Orson... I'll take it. - Unfortunately, it is no longer for sale. It was a shame. - No, because now it's yours. Greetings from Mr. Simmonds. He's a big fan. Mr. Danny Francesco... In your own high person. The legend! - They are way too friendly. No, I'm Greg Simmonds and I say thank you - - for all the entertainment over the years. It's an incredibly nice gesture, but I can't accept that. Yes, and there are two reasons for that: Firstly, you've earned it, secondly, we need to raise money. Speaking of which, may I introduce... Trent and Arnold. Both are in the bio-tech industry, and you must excuse me, but… 22 billion, 17 billion. Sorry, guys, but it's a fact. - And they are the evening's sponsors. - Big fan. Thanks. Good case. We do our best. Orphans, war... Let me introduce the... enchanting Michaela. An exquisite pleasure. - The pleasure is mine. Can I say... Can you say something like that now? Wow... Wow. Wow. - Good day. And you are? - Charlie Rosewood. Good day, Charlie. - My manager Charlie Rosewood. Are you sure? You don't look like a manager. - Books and their covers... - Big book, what? He has doubled my fortune in three years. - You do not say? Do you have any tips? They probably don't need tips. - You just had to know how greedy I am. We hope you have your pants on tonight. It cannot be deducted, so no. And Danny doesn't like children. There are actually two war children tonight and they are dead annoying. I don't want to push, but we have many exciting guests... Emilia, take this. You must greet some of them. Mr. Simmonds, I'm quite shy... - It's the least you can do. Mr. Simmonds just spent 1.5 million on you. To be fair, I used them on Michaela. Shouldn't we get the bar manager to conjure up some drink? You usually ask me that too. But with the pants down... I guess I didn't hear right. I pretend I didn't hear. To the bar. You must have washed your mouth with soap. I grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and said, "Say that again and I'll screw your throat." But I could feel a small bump. Two days later he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. A year later he won his first Tour de France. That was good! He is funny. And naughty. - Yes... - Tell me more. How do we get to his phone? - His bodyguard still has it. Find her. A task for the infantry. - Why can't you do it? After all, you wanted more tangible tasks. Have soil under your nails. Order something more. He cost me a fortune. See! It's pure magic. Like, yeah, do some tricks. I'll order, then you can powder your nose. - Thank you very much. It's all about training. What are you going to do in the meantime, Charlie Rosewood? The waiter behind you was at the airport in Madrid. Nathan, Mike is back. - Focus on Greg, I'll handle Mike. You do your thing and I do mine. Fine, darling. Bring some more. The vile ones. I like them better. This one is good... Item number 6 from the Delamont collection is a unique ring with a blue sapphire... Where? - She is close to his office. I know. Where is it? - Straight ahead and then left. Stay close to it so I can hook up. Good evening, Nathan. Are you now in and smashing everything again? Mike, nobody likes you. Not even your wife. At least that's what she said as she tangled herself out of my chest hair. One day you will realise- - that I have more money, more people and am better informed. You don't have a chance. Where? She whispered that you have a nasty little penis- - and I know how small your brain is. Am I the one who should be worried? Still running operations from your garage? Better that than needing surgery. We're way ahead of you, Nathan. Overhauled as usual. You're just screwing it up like you usually do. Stay away. Great little microphone... - Okay, now what? - Stay there. Emilia is in the next room. I can hook up from here. Back towards the door. If I back up more, my ass explodes. JJ, who is he? - Wait, I'll help Sarah. Hurry up. I'm behind him. - Then we are connected. Can I help you? Hello. I just admired the painting. - Excuse me, who are you? - Michaela. I'm here with Danny Francesco. Oh yeah. I saw you up there. Greg told me about the painting and he knows I love art so… I curate Mr. Simmonds' collection. - Oh boy! This is actually a real Rhed. - Wow... Rhed with H. You have it under control. It is quite agreed. Do you work with art? - No, it's just a great interest. I need a few more minutes. Keep him busy. I am fascinated by the philosophical motivations of collectors. Are we moving into deep water? - I do not know. Do we? Vincent Young, former elite soldier. Kicks well, hits even better. I didn't ask for his life story. The name is ample. Cut his connection. Good evening, sir. Vincent, right? Vincent, can I hear Orson? - How can I help? Calm down, Mike can't hear this. Listen and enjoy, Mike. Vincent? Vincent! - Connection cut. - Who is Mike? We can play that game - - but no matter what, you have to swim ashore. Vincent! Continue. I am interested in the paradox of the dualistic drive. He will try to bribe you. The only question is whether it will be with a broken nose... ...or with the face intact and this watch on the wrist. The canvas should be a portal to the abstract, transcendental life - - which gives the creative expression a kind of intrinsic value. Mike? Fuck you, Orson! Can you hear me? What is the paradox? That there is beauty... in the dirt. - What else do you have? - Good question. I appreciate people with high self-preservation. But there are limits. Why didn't the clock work? The most beautiful roses grow in stinking dung. Am I being analysed now? A minute. But I have no idea if my theory is credible. Do you have one for me too? Vincent, you get one more chance while your nose is still straight. Which hand? Left or right? It was right. I'll just take my watch. Such! - Well. Exit. The rich like to show off their wealth. - I'm going back. - Thanks for the chatter. - What was your name? - Michaela. - Have a nice evening. - You too. What's next for Danny Francesco? - My next film role? I will play an enigmatic billionaire - - which makes a transcendental journey from material genius to spiritual light. It's almost creepy, huh? It was me you described. Now I got an idea, Danny. Why don't you spend some time with me - - and find the figure? Charlie? - Michaela. Did it go well? - Yes. And you? Yes. I'll be with you in a bit. - Then I save the movie star. Good luck, Vincent. Michaela, your boyfriend wants to use me as inspiration for his next film. So I got an idea. How about a trip to my Turkish villa this weekend? Then Danny can get some tips. Monkey after me. Do what I do. Now what I do... What do I do? We'll find out soon enough. - Exactly. Could it be something? I have a few things going on, but I can probably move around a bit. You have a lot going on, Michaela, but now we were talking about the weekend. - Gregory, how are you? - Well, though! Privetogza zdorovje. We have been waiting to be introduced to Danny Francesco. Of course. Danny, this is my good friends Aleksander - - Natalja, Big Jev, the always sullen Katja - - and the slightly frightening Dmitri. I'm a big fan. Do you mind...? - Is it selfie time? - Take it easy. - Do it. - Danny? It's going to be good. Can you move a little more together? They are like pirate fish. They pounce on him. No, we're not done yet. In a little while he will be a skeleton. Watch your hands, Dmitri. Why are you looking at me like that, Greg? I'm sure you know that. You know I'm busy. Yes, and I fully respect that. But if I may flatter a little... Danny is a famous actor and it's impressive - - but actors work for someone, right? And you don't seem like someone to mess with. Wait, I'm not done. I believe that you are... a free soul. I don't really know what that means. It was a pleasure... - That movie where you were the villain... Come here. The world is much, much bigger than you can ever imagine. Let me show it to you. - Michaela. - Hey, Charlie. Does the superstar need to be saved? - Danny, shall we...? Michaela, think about it. Your manager will come to your rescue. - Yes, before you tear him to pieces. - Come with your hand. - No, Danny, stay here! We love you Danny! I love you! Just look at the beautiful pictures. Dmitry, your tongue is sticking out and you are holding his cock. Well done, Danny. Yes, and I guess we're going on a weekend with Greggy. So you have to stop that. I don't know if it was the best or worst experience of my life. But Danny Francesco as Danny Francesco, that is the way forward. Congratulations on a successful evening. Debriefing at 07.00. Well done. Well, Greg... - Well, Aleksander. With your summer discount, so we land at $10 billion... - Then we have an agreement. - Fantastic! Who is the buyer? I'm not saying that. I must protect every link in the chain. So I protect them, yes, but I also protect you. So now I tell them you are happy. Then they will be happy, and then we can all be happy together. - It should be celebrated. - Yes! Emily! Just have one of those mindless vodkas. The one with the diamond plug. You will love it. Are the departments not talking to each other? Someone gives Mike inside information. Mike doesn't seem to work for this government. I need more time to find out what state he works for. Tell what you know. We have only established that Alexander is selling something for 10 billion dollars. Greg Simmonds is the go-between. - Who is the buyer? It's still a mystery, but not for much longer. Orson is right. Greg has a penchant for snagging girlfriends, especially from movie stars. So accept his invitation. It is a vulnerable position. - I've tried worse things than Greg. - Exposed? - It is not easy to get there. The movie star is not up to it. - Yes he does. What about Trent and Arnold? The bio-tech billionaires buy a hell of a lot of gold. Now we know the Ukrainians are in on it. Greg loves what they sell. I know where they live, but I can't easily get into their computers. Opportunities? The fastest is to install software. Break in and install via USB? - Yes, it is the most effective. It's just you. - Don't I belong to the foot people? No, you are the technical genius. - And you're the hammer? If there are problems, I can do it. - No, JJ. I do it. I can penetrate the Ukrainians. - I hope you give dinner first. That is, before you enter... ...sexually. You got over the wall. Great. Reroutes the air conditioner. And now they sleep like little children and won't wake up for the time being. You can go inside. The doors are opening now. Up the stairs, the bedroom on the left. Once you install the program, make it look like a hack. Take some watches, pry open the safe and take some cash, treasures. The more you take, the more believable it looks. You don't have time to watch TV, honey. Get started. - Have you found the laptop? - Yes. Insert the USB and hit "Enter". What they control, I can control even better. We have full access to their computer. Now everything is sucked out and you put it back. There are still two guards outside. Take the front door. Great, darling. We will pick you up at the main gate. Don't move! No! - What is it? - A watchdog. Guard. Dog. - I'm good with dogs. - Lovely. - And your mate? - Power nap. Are you done? I heard a shot. Someone died? - No, but not thanks to you. - What? - You said there was a free lane. - In front, yes. - I came out that way. You usually have 50 meter pools behind the house. Front, back, right, wrong. Yes, yes... Shall we? - JJ. - Good morning. Sarah said I didn't miss anything. - The pearl. - So no one saw you? - Yes. - Yes, no one saw you? - Yes. - Or yes, you were seen? - Yes. Childish. Don't worry. Enjoy your gluten-free, lactose-intolerant rabbit meal. I found this on the Ukrainian's laptop. The agreement seems to be in place. They link to a blocked account. - What do they sell? - We still don't know. So it could be a fuser. - Greg's phone is active. Yes? - You are on loudspeaker. I enjoy the view with Arnold. Are you guys back at Disneyland yet? Did you beam there or what? Pet the horse, you. Yesterday I looked like a candy bar. You should be glad we came. Your friends are quite suspicious. You're not wrong, but they're more acquaintances than friends. And yes, we collected quite a bit for the war children. A bunch of uneducated rich men outbid each other in the name of selfishness and self-aggrandisement. That was kind of the point, Trent. When did you become an ardent anti-capitalist? We are anti-capitalists. Anti other capitalists. There's someone else calling. Thanks darling. - Then take it. What was the purpose of this conversation? - We just wanted to check that everything is okay. That is it. Just remember: The colour is yellow, the game is called gold. And I still love you guys. We'll talk by. - Good day, Qasim. - Can you speak? I just spoke to Aleksander. - Is everything ready? It is not easy to get an answer out of him. He is in a bad mood. He is very proud of his security, but yesterday a burglar got in. He drugged them and emptied the house of cash and jewellery. On his way out, he was stopped by Aleksander's bodyguards. Don't move! I will shoot! Do not shoot! Leave me alone. Here are my hands. Two guards hospitalized... No, not prison! I have children. One with a broken nose, three broken ribs... He calls for mother. ...and two tassel balls. The other got a bullet in the foot. You shot me in the foot! Don't call mom. I need to know that kind of thing. - You dropped the chopsticks. Dry your mouth. Should I be worried? - We continue. I'm waiting for confirmation, but the turkey plane takes off in 72 hours. Keep me posted, Qasim. - Understood. What the hell do they mean by the "turkey plane"? - I have traced Qasim's phone. The Ukrainians must have help if they have to enter a country illegally. Where does Qasim live? - In Antalya, Turkey. Cluck, cluck. Turkey as in turkey, and Turkey borders Ukraine. The turkey flight. Flying to Turkey. - Isn't that a bit far-fetched? You might think so, but Qasim Amari is a diplomat - - and works for the Turkish government in Antalya. How do I do it? Sharp brain. - Do I have a brain in there? Yep! The modern woman... What's next? Then we all go with the turkey plane. We shadow Qasim. Sarah, you go with Danny as planned and find out what it is Greg is buying. That explains why Greggy is spending the weekend in Turkey. It's called something when you lose after four moves. - Stupid food. - It wasn't four moves. If you can get over that cat pain, get a glass of this. What do we know about Qasim, JJ? - Libya with the whole world as a workplace. Met Greg in the 00's and quickly became his henchman. He's been smearing people and getting bodies out of Greg's way ever since. Great. Taste it here. - I'm not really into wine. Is it the 2004? - Don't you have anything to do? There is wine, and then there is wine. - You must not force him. Congratulations, Doctor Frankenstein. You have created another monster. You don't pour fish oil into a Ferrari. Miss Paradox... Have you got her on your mind? Hello. Good to see you. - There we have them, my new best friends. Hosgeldiniz, as we say in Turkey. Thanks for the private plane. - It was only the small one. - Danny Francesco. - Good to see you. I look forward to learning from the master. - I'm no champion. Before we do anything else, I have to show you something. Grab a drink on the way. A Corniche, vintage 75. Delightful. - Yes, I got it from Elton. It looks like the car I was driving in... - Yes, and do you know why? It can not be true. - But it is. Lovingly prepared with my own fists. No, not my own fists. It's gas. But it's delicious, isn't it? Look at him! - I have driven that car. - Yes honey. And he did his own stunts. Is that right, Danny? Do you still know them? - I'm a little out of practise, but yes. We will do it! After lunch, okay? I'll probably skip it, but have fun. After lunch, Michaela, you will be treated to a hot stones massage by Suki and Sasha. And they have complete control over the female geography. Not too, Emilia? - Yeah. - It sounds wonderful. - She looks nervous. - I am not. You even have the prop gun! - It's not a prop anymore, so... Think you bought it... I really wanted it. How would you like to? Of all the cars I've driven in movies, this is the only one I would own. - Did you crave it? - Yes. - Did you long for it? - Yes. - Did you dream about it? - I sighed for it. You know what? It is yours. Come, we'll have lunch. - What? - It is yours. Come on! - Okay! - Do you like kebabs? - What's in the bag? - Nothing. Do you walk around with an empty bag? You chopped the Margaux, didn't you? - Chopped and chopped... You don't leave half a bottle behind. - So you're the doggie bag type? Do you know what it costs? - He has no concept of that. Room keys. Shall we meet here in an hour? We must shadow the Libyan. That's my key. - Yes, because you have taken the best room. Maybe I've already swapped them. - Forget it. You're not that cunning. Think I'm sitting in the car with the actor! Is the rear end still bulletproof? - Yes, it's a good selling point. How did you change when you went from millionaire to billionaire? Interesting question. And now I guess I should say that money does not make you happy. But you know what, Danny? It sure does. I am happier today and I am a better person. I worry now. About the world, about the war children... You don't strike me as someone who cares. And you don't strike me as someone who drives like a bitch. Well, so it's that way? Calm down, Danny Francesco! You drive me into my dreams! Everything okay, Michaela? Yes! Hang on, a huge place. And how beautiful this one is. "Mimar Sinan." - Are you looking for your room? - Yes! My room is... that way. - No, the other one. Of course. - To the right down there, and then to the left. The massage was fantastic. Join us next time. - To the right. - Yep. Understood. See you. Qasim stirs. - Shall we follow him? Not yet. I guess he just needs a coffee. Hello Hello. How does he do it? - Mike? Never mind, now he's here. - It's Mike, right? Where does he get information from? Ground control. - Can you hear me, Major Tom? Loud and clear. - How are you? - Loop the monitor... They have a ridiculous firewall that took a minute to penetrate. Done. He must have finished the newspaper. Qasim drives and Mike follows. - Are we going after them? - We'll leave that to Mike. I bet on the newspaper. - Fine, boss. Would you like an ice cream? - Then I'm in. - Well. - What is he buying? - Wait. Here is a file from Qasim. He uses RSA encryption. Disappointing. - What? Greg is out for trouble. Not a big deal, just a deal. You must not be evil. Come up with something. - Greg buys stolen AK-47s. Very funny. Now be serious. - I am serious. We were wrong. See for yourself. Hello Hello. We've seen him before. Shall we...? - I buy ice cream, you pick up the car. It can't fit, Sarah. All the fuss about guns for 30 million? They are too big players. It can be a clever diversionary manoeuvre. Enough for a suspicion, but not a conviction. Understood, but there is nothing here that links him to the Object. Damn. Well, hurry and get away. Let me see if I can find something we can use against him another good time. Hurry up. Orson, are you there? - What? Come home. We were wrong. It is not the Object. They sell guns. - Go back to bed. I can handle it. Sarah showed me evidence. We are done. I do not think. Our friend Ben Harris is back. If Greg called Ben in, it's not about guns. Shadow him, but no contact. I tell Sarah we will continue. - Can you see me, JJ? - I've got you here, boss. Shall we take him? - No. The cat follows the mouse. Can you get to his phone? - Yes, if you are close. I can connect via your phone, but it goes faster if it's in use. Get close enough to arouse suspicion. Then he activates it. Are we being shadowed? Ugly smell I have blocked a text message. Then I'm on. I have blocked his call. No service. - Take care of that. - Yes. - Are you lost? - Thanks. Can you help me? - I'm looking for the port. - The path. I just blocked one more text. We are exposed. He has recognised you. It was odd... According to the map, it is that way. No, it's that way. Unbelievable. They are absolutely right. Thanks. Take him. He runs off. If he gets too far away, I can't block his mobile. After him. He is in the building on the left. Ten meters in front of you. He is on two wheels. Say something. - 15 metres, and then to the right. Left or right? - Left. I'll lose him in a bit. JJ, say something. - He's stopped. He's right in front of you. He slipped away. The stairs? - To the right. Good day. Excuse me, would you like to take a picture of me with the view? It's just stairs. Come on. - Next time you can be in charge of the hunt! Can I see? Great. Bring your phone and I'll take one from you. He's still there. There is no one here. - Yes, you are standing right over his phone. Oh no... Why did you do that? - Wait, I'm here now. There is a sprawled corpse 60 meters below me. It's Harris. Take the phone, the newspaper... And get the body into the car. - It's not Ben Harris. - What do you mean? This is Ben Harris. - Is he in the back? - Yes. Nathan, can you confirm? The file Sarah took from Greg's computer - - is the encryption key for the hard disk, so it is the Object. So what is it? - A completely new form of programmable AI. We had hoped it was still on the way - - but it is obviously ready to drive. It can hack all systems, including other AI programs. For what purpose? - Anything. It could launch a nuclear attack and direct suspicion to someone else. It can take over and control anything controlled by a computer. And we still don't know what they will use it for. But we can confirm that Aleksander is selling the Object- -with Greg Simmonds as middleman, for 10 billion dollars. Confirmed. - What now? When does the transaction take place? - Tomorrow at 09.00. According to the newspaper and data from his phone - - Ben Harris was to be picked up in the lobby of the Hotel Amara by Aleksander's representative. Then they had to transfer the deposited sum. But he needs a 15 digit code from Greg - - so unfortunately we still need Ben Harris. - Too bad he died. - Childish. Can we turn me into Ben Harris? - Elaborate. They don't know what he looks like. He made a point of not showing himself to people. Mr. Harris? A green G-waggon is parked outside. My people follow you out. I complete the transaction alone. - But you have to talk to Greg on the phone. A pleasure to meet you. Your phone, please. - Something else? - No. - Do you allow? - Of course. I can't make you sound like him. - Don't we know someone who can? The thing is, Danny and Michaela, it's something I inherited. My father could too. It could be a toy, a pair of shoes... He put his hand on it, closed his eyes and said the price. "14.99." So that's right. - Just keep talking. I have to turn on the water. You know the way, right? Yes, past Mimar Sinan and to the right by Timur. - She is funny. - Fantastic. You are lucky. Down with the lid. Look here... Then you say: "Relax, steak!" Now it is calm. Sarah, Ben Harris has sadly passed away. A few hours ago. Orson made him jump off a very tall building. Can you make him sound like Harris? - Do you have recordings of his voice? Send them to me and I'll fix it. - How? The vocoder works in real time. Good, we have AI. One last thing: Can you confirm that you have access to Aleksander's computer? Confirmed. Get ready. There is water in the door pocket. So far, so good. - Well. Keep in touch, JJ. You must entertain yourselves for an hour, because I have to call. I could use a nap. - Then I'll go along. New plan: Danny, you call. Then I'll take the nap and Michaela, you can come with me. They drive off the road. I'm parking. He's smart enough. It is deeply impressive. And he absolutely loves you. If you're not interested, I am. - Here you go. What are you doing? - Orson should sound like Greg's lawyer. Why? Ben Harris is dead and we need him alive. When? And who killed him? - You don't have to worry about that. You better worry about when we will be exposed. I know you're enjoying your billionaire romance. But not much more than 20 minutes pass before Greg's guards shoot us. What should I do? - Prepare for the next scene. - Which is? - The escape. Oh yeah. I can do that. Action. - See you in the garage. - Okay, honey. They will come soon. Connected. - Sergey. - Chief. In place. Mr. Harris, I presume? - A pleasure. - You too. Such... Your people have confirmed the authenticity. Here is the Object. I need to use my phone. Yes, Benjamin. - Mr. Simmonds. We have connection. - Fine. - It looks good. The 15-digit code. Can I be alone for a moment? - Emilia... - What's up? Looks like someone broke in. - We are waiting to come online. - I am waiting. I've been trying to make it for days. It's like someone hacked in. Who hacked in? - It comes from here. Ready for the 15-digit code. It comes here. Thaw... ...six, two... Harris is now transferring. - Update. - On it. Put it here... - Show me where. - The signal dances around... ...tilde, eight, five... ...nine, little b as in buns... ...five, six... ...five, five, comma... ...and capital C as in clitoris. Such. Ponytail at 11. Show Greg's office. I know Greg is there. Why is it empty? Do you have it? - Yes. The transaction has been completed. Good, Ben. Hurry home and don't talk to strangers. Check all incoming and outgoing communications in the past 24 hours. He doesn't like you. - It's the guard from the house. I have him on the grain. - The payment is confirmed. - 10 billion. Confirmed. - Confirmed. - Mazel rope! - Confirmed. Hestehalen files a complaint. Thank you, Mr. Harris. - Stop! That's not Ben Harris! Helicopters! - Shoot him! - JJ? Sarah, update. - I de-confirm the confirmation. - What happens? - It was confirmed! JJ, find out who they are. Give me a minute. - 30 seconds! - I don't understand... - What don't you understand? They are gone. Don't say it's Mike. - Understood. Then I'll leave it at that. - Who is it? - I must not say that. Piss! Now you guys have to stop! I've got Orson under control. - Get that gun away. And bring it. Is that you in the helicopter, Mike? - You sound upset, Orson. Don't think about me. I feel brilliant. Did you get an engine stall? Take it easy. I give the bus ticket home. We're taking over now. Come on... Who are you? Who are you, Michaela? How did you do it? This between the two of us... It is strong. Do you know what the Turks call it? Kivilcim. It means spark. And it is said that the gods get angry if you turn it off. But I'll turn it off anyway, Michaela. Danny is my friend and I respect him. It is the right thing to do. Sorry if I disappoint you. It's alright. See you at dinner. Find any survivors. Bind them, beat them, and bring them here. I will take off as soon as possible. Orson, you know why I'm here. Don't make it worse than it already is. I want my reward. So get your ass down here after it. I have people for that kind of thing. - At a safe distance as usual? - You're a coward, Mike. - Yatom, take the folder. Here you go. But you don't take it. I give it to you. Now what is that? - He has a gun. - Just relax. Oh, selfie! Okay! What happens? They entered the secure server. - So it's not quite safe, is it? Unfortunately, it is even worse. It was a completely different person on the phone. Ready for the 15-digit code. - It's Ben. Ready for the 15-digit code. Stop Danny Francesco and whoever the hell that is. Now! After that car. Get them back. - Is it running? - Yes, we have it. Check the folder. You have the folder, so why are we on our knees? - You are not much anymore. Orson, something fishy is going on. - It looks fine. - Well! The mood has changed. Mike just executed the Ukrainian. We have what we must have. Connors? - Yes, boss. Kill Orson. - They kill you. - Then shoot them first. I'm not only good with dogs. Great. There's a helicopter with a dead pilot here. - Coming. Nathan? Greg's guards are after us. - Then do something about it. The rear end is bulletproof, but impossible to control. Do you have it under control? - It's been a while since the last... I feel forward. It's just a helicopter. Feeling forward... Can you gas up a little? What are you going to do with it? - Shoot them, Danny. I can help with that. No more bullets. - Nathan, are you there? - Yes. Your friend Mike has reappeared, but he has switched sides. He executed the Ukrainians and took the AI. I chase him in a helicopter. Did the others get away unscathed? - Don't think about them. They manage. The road is closed! They were exposed. Greg's guards are after them. You just need to grab the folder. Find out where they are. - Two minutes southwest of us. They drive into the tunnel. Can you handle the rockets? - How hard can it be? F as in forward, R as in rocket. This doesn't look good! Whoa. R must stand for backward. - That much I have understood now, JJ. We have to hope there is room in the helicopter. Knighton has confirmed that Mike is acting on his own. What a surprise... - You must find him. DIY. We're going to see Greg. - Shall we? - Are you going? - Shall we? I can not. Danny, take it easy. JJ will take care of you. So I don't think Greg wants to see you. - Yes, he really wants to see me. Sarah has enough on him to get him locked up forever. I'll find something for another good time. So Greg works for us now. JJ, tell Greg we're coming with an offer he can't refuse. As you wish, boss. - Can't we drop me off first? Take it easy, Danny. Greg loves you. - Sit down, Danny! If you're wondering if I feel like a bit of an idiot - - then the answer is yes. I do. - Is it humiliating, Emilia? - Yes. - Do we think we can figure something out? - Yes. I will not belittle your brilliant plan, Orson Fortune. Sexy name. Aren't you a bit crazy about him? Fake Michaela... I'm still kind of crazy about you. Using him, a celebrity, as a Trojan horse was superb. Your competitor Mike is almost as superb. Rolls in and pretends to be the guardian of the law - - chops your fireworks and probably my commission. You can keep your commission, Gregory. - So? Yes. You can keep your commission, your reputation, your freedom… Because you donate your commission to what you are most passionate about: children of war. Oh... Do I? Who's the buyer, Greg? - I never reveal my buyers, Orson. Emilia, say it. - Do you remember Trent and Arnold? May I introduce... Trent and Arnold. - The bio-tech billionaires? - Exactly. Right now they are using your precious programmable AI - - or the Object, as you call it, along with a fleet of satellites. We enjoy the view. The goal is to destroy the world's banking system. So that's why they're buying up 40 billion worth of gold while they erase their tracks. Namely, Orson. When they are finished, gold is the only sensible means of payment. You lead us there. - Yes, and I'll probably be let in. Because I have something they can't ignore, a comprehensive insurance policy. But I'm more unsure about you. Trent and Arnold have hired a nasty private army. That will be my concern. Can I just say something? I would do anything to see you in action. Danny... How can I say no to that? Well... What are they going to use the Object for? The object... will be a financial nuclear bomb. It will knock out the world's banking system. Maybe just for a few minutes- -but it will be enough to puncture confidence in the conventional markets. Gold will, as always... ...be the only trustworthy currency. The value will explode. Anarchy will arise while a new world order is created. Well, Nathan... Now is the time for your man to prove his worth. Everyone leaves the room. - Anita. - Yes, Mr. Knighton. Call the Prime Minister. Then the bird is in the air. Soon we will have eyes. And Greg and Danny have arrived. I give the floor to you. Strategy? Blitzkrieg. Strike before they can perceive anything. I like that. I've got you covered. There are blind spots. - That's why we have the bird, JJ. JJ... Shoot properly. Do not worry. - How are you? - Well. - Nervous? - No. Do you remember your lines? You only have two. - Did you get it with the light? - Yes. And one more thing, Danny. Off with the sunglasses. And we're back. There are four guards at the pagoda. I block their communication. Blocked. I'll take the two on the right. Hey guys. What a lot of serious mines. Danny, you remember those two, right? Trent and Arnold. And one of you… You're Mike, aren't you too? Nice job, Mike. A bit cheeky as a government employee, but what's done is done. Moving forward. Two more ahead of you. I'll take it at one o'clock. The purpose of our visit is... Danny? You never paid Mr. Simmonds' commission. We paid you to deliver, but you didn't. Mike did. You didn't. - Isn't it a bit thin? I was not paid to deliver, but to supply. I did, didn't I, Danny? - To the left through the hedge. - Two on the bridge. Free path. Do we really have to listen to this? - Yes, and here is the reason: I don't want to sound condescending, because I'm not. But you three, one, two, three, are a bit of a novice, aren't you? And there's a reason why no one, and I mean- - neither Mr. Hussein, Mr. Gaddafi or Mr. Escobar... And now I am not mentioning the very famous ones. They have never refused to pay me. Can you see me? - I'm just going to find you... - In the Can-Am. Behind me you can probably see an abandoned hotel from the 60s. It must be torn down. It can be managed with 15-20 kilos of explosives. Is that right, Mike? Communication still interrupted. Two guards further on. But you could also do it with... The light, thanks, Danny. An AGM-65 Maverick missile. Much like what you see in three, two, one... What happened? Well, we try again. In three, two, one... Wait, wait... More to come. I guess that was all. Danny, are you turning it on? What do you want to show with this demonstration, Mr. Simmonds? What I'm trying to show, Mike, is how little you actually know - - about the new world you find yourself in. Naturally, I have arranged for some form of insurance. The papers, Danny. On the left is a list - - with names and addresses of people who I believe are your near and dear ones. Take the goods elevator down one floor. He's inside. Phase two. And on the right you can see the exact time when these people... How do you say that nicely, Danny? - Uh... Will it bounce up? It wasn't very nice, but it's not that far - - because I'm sure that within five minutes... And five minutes is all you have, because the countdown has begun. And the only thing that can stop it... ...is a call from my manager... ...if my money has been transferred to my account. So now it is solely in your hands. Danny, let's get a drink. Came. Goodbye, guys. We better give him the money. - Mike, it's my mother! Jean! I have never seen anything so impressive. - Is that right? Transfer the money now. Right now! He's bluffing. - The explosions were not a bluff! Why do you think he is called the Merciless Black Angel of Death? He's bluffing. You can easily say that. Was there anyone on your list? You can forget about your commission, Mike. Such a couple of crazy IT freaks. I'll fix it. Back! It is your solutions that have got us on the bucket list. I don't want to hear your opinion, Mike! So back with you, dammit! I'm going back. I'm going back. Calm down, everyone. Mike is upset. How are you, Orson? - I live and work my way up. Greg and the movie star are gone. It's getting worse. Chris, how far along are you? - It's underway. 30 seconds. They are transferring the money now. A billion for the war children. It will be alright. - Didn't you see what happened? I'm in their system now and can move their money around. I'm better than them and you don't need them anymore. The arms dealer was your idea, so don't try to rub it in on me. There were bombs exploding out there. Are you just going to ignore it? Can I go in? - Hard to say. I see no movement. What a mess. I found the folder, JJ. I'm just checking. It looks good. Orson, behind you. In three, two, one... Don't, Mike. Leave it alone. Orson, I need that damn folder! If you want it that badly, Mike, go ahead. - What do you have in the folder? - Our salary. Is it Nathan and his army? - It's not Nathan. It's Knighton's special forces, late as usual. Nathan needed something important. - Of course. The plane is here. He is in Doha because of a new incident. No panic, he said. All your health needs are on board. Did you bring a corkscrew? - I can be your corkscrew, honey. Of course. Move a little, we're going on vacation. I take it you are satisfied with your efforts? How can we be satisfied with the salary you pay? Good news. Due to your success, don't let it go to your head - - I have a new task for you. And this time it's good money. I do not care. I am going on holiday. Here. - Where are we going, honey? It doesn't matter as long as it's hot, expensive and he pays. We're taking the plane. - Just do it. There is free play. Enjoy the snow or the beach... I give, as long as you are back in 36 hours. - Two weeks. - Orson! I'm not good at skiing. - I just want to get drunk. - Okay then, 48 hours! - Ten days. - You're killing me! 96 hours! - One week. We need the jewelry and watches you stole from the Ukrainians. Their government wants them back. Too late. I have sold them and invested the money. Now we are in the film industry. See you next Tuesday. Wait... Orson! The film industry? I hope it has nothing to do with Danny Francesco and his fiance Greg Simmonds! Well done guys do. That though. God you statistical data at all. I couldn't. We were paying to diddy but. He didn't Mike did you failed. Yeah well that's a bit naughty mr Yamamoto I'm not paid to deliver I'm paid to supply. Now, there's a very good reason why nobody. And I mean no one. Not Mr. Hussein, Not Mr. Khadaffi nor Mr. Escobar... and that's before I start dropping names. Behind me you see an abandoned monastery, in need of demolition. How are we going to do that? Well, We could. Use 50, 60 pounds Semtex that sounds about right, Mr. Yamamoto. But one can also use a single AMG-65 Maverick missile. Very much like this. Going in three. Two. One. Amateur. Let's see! Where's the beer? Come on, man! Get it fixed. Can you get me. Got a camera. Camera's reset everybody. What do you think, Greggy? I'll be honest with you. For me... That was very very moving. That was. That was beautiful. That one. That one. I dunno.. That was not my best take. Did you like that one? I like what you are doing there. You're smiling but you're scary too. Look at my hair. Off. - There! It's brilliant. - I think we could do another. Another. Few guys. Hmm.
