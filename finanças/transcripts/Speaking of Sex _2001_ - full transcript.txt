¶ Huhh ¶ ¶ hahh ¶ Captioning made possible by lions gate entertainment. There you are. Meli... man: Oh, God! Oh, God. Come on. Melinda! Open up! It's me! Man: Hey, asshole! Use the door knocker. Oh. Oh! Oh, I love you! Melinda! Are you all right?! Oh, God! Danny, it's him! He followed us here! Hey, there is somebody else in there! Open this door! Melinda! I... aah! Hey, hey, hey! Aah! Call the police! Unh! Hey, asshole, try the doorknob! Let me in! Get your hands off her! You. What? Meli... Jesus chr... you're screwing your husband?! Your husband. He followed me here, and we realized we deserve each other. Isn't that romantic, Dr. Klink? Roger. Call me Roger, for Christ sakes. Maybe you should try going home and working it out with your wife. Go to hell, Roger. Ex-wife, ex-home, ok? Melinda: I understand now that I was transgressing my love for Dan onto you, and you were countertransgressing. Transferring! Bullshit! Yeah, any time a shrink is thinking about a patient more than he normally does, he should ask himself, "am I countertransferring?" Shut up. You can't even get an erection, for God s... I just had one, buddy. Hair! Hair! He's biting! Dan: I got him! Melinda: Dr. Paige, thank God you're here. 3 peas in a pod. Emily, they were fornicating like a couple of honeymooners. Dr. Paige, Melinda and I have worked through our problem. Shut up. You... aah! Dr. Paige! Aah! It's all right! It's ok! Sorry! It has a hair trigger. It's ok. Hey, hey, put the gun down, Dr. Paige. Shoot them, Emily. This is all your fault, Roger! Everything could've been so different! Oh, sorry. Sorry. It's touchy. It's touchy. Melinda, come back in here! Emily, I understand you're upset. Sometimes you just have to let it out. Just try and let it out. Save your engaging devices, Roger. No more bullshit! None! I've come for us! Sorry! Sorry. Over here! Over here! Hurry! Hurry! Over here! Hurry! Dr. Paige has a gun. Who's Dr. Paige? Our marriage counselor. She's gonna kill my husband and Dr. Klink. Your marriage counselor's gonna kill your husband? And Dr. Klink. Dr. Paige, hi. Uh, I wanna thank you for giving Melinda and I the... the tools to help communicate and share our feelings. Shut up! Ok. Emily, you're very upset. Sometimes we can feel as if our lives are just spiraling out of control, just spiraling. Save your psychobabble for your little Doe-eyed patients, Roger. Ok. Ok, terrific. You two obviously have some issues you need to work through. Thank God. No. No. Wait. Move it, klink. Out of my way! Mel, it's me! Open up! Dan: Somebody help me! Melinda: Don't worry, Danny! Wow. What do we got, sir? Hostage situation. 2 therapists. Domestic or international? Therapists. Shrinks. Shrinks? It's a joke, right? Some kind of surprise party? It's not a goddamn party. It's very serious. Her marriage counselor's threatening to kill her husband and her therapist. He's not technically my therapist. Hey, you're the lady from those sex tapes. Sex tapes? What sex tapes? His hands were under my dress, firmly holding on to my hips, moving me back and forth away from him. Ok, maybe I better start at the beginning. About 2 years ago, Danny lost his erection. You gotta see these tapes, sir. Pretty soon, Danny and me weren't even talking, and then. Danny slept with that cocktail waitress. I thought he couldn't get an erection. So did I. Right. Our marriage was doomed. Then I saw Dr. Paige's ad on a bus bench. "Save your marriage today." "Tomorrow will be too late." Her big deal is honesty. Honesty first. The key is honesty. Marriage is hard. I know. I've been married 3 times. You're divorced? 3 times. That's why I speak from experience... what kind of track record is that for a marriage counselor? Dan! Dan? What, "Dan"? Come on. We're taking marriage advice from somebody that's been divorced and advertises on bus benches. Wh-what? Stay with us, Dan. You know the story about the guy who goes to the barbershop. There are 2 barbers, both available. One barber has a terrific haircut. The other barber's hair looks just awful. Which barber would you go to? You'd go to the barber with the bad haircut, not the barber with the good haircut, see? The bad haircut cuts the other one's hair, and vice versa. That is why it is actually a plus that I'm thrice divorced. Ok. Let's start over. What do you want out of this therapy? We... I wanna save our marriage. Uh, yeah. Me... me, too, yeah. Great. Now talking about our problems is the first step. You can tell me anything, and hopefully you two can learn to communicate honestly with each other. What's the problem? Well, uh... Danny and me... We haven't been... Familiar with each other in a while. "Familiar"? Intimate. No sexual intercourse? Jesus, lady. What about oral sex or mutual masturbation? Oh, my God, Mel. Let's get outta here. We don't need to see some shrink. No. I think we do, Dan. He has a problem with... don't. Come on. Why? Mr. Happy. "Mr. Happy"? His penis. My... just say it! Penis! I can't get my penis to stand up. I-I-I'm impotent or something. I can't wake the baby. I-I've... I can't get a hard-on! Is everybody happy now?! Can we go? Dan is impotent. Only with me. That was an accident. Dan accidentally screwed that cocktail waitress! I thought Dan couldn't get an erection. So did I. Well, Melinda's been so damn depressed lately, you know? It's pretty depressing when you can't excite your own husband. Great. We have made some real progress. All those in favor, raise your hands. Dr. Paige. You may rejoin the group. Dr. Paige, it is the duty of this committee to defend the integrity of the psychiatric arts in the Boise, nampa, Caldwell tri-city area. Dr. Paige... if we allow bus bench advertising, what's next? Billboards? Cable TV? Following our bylaws pertaining to outdoor advertising, the fine is set at $250. Roger! Huh? Oh. Hello, Emily. Sorry about the fine. Ah, it's only 250 bucks. I'll write it off. Oh. Besides, I already got a couple of clients from the bus bunch. It's funny. I was thinking about you the other day. Me? Really? Are you seeing anyone new? Oh, I'm s-still married. I... I meant patients. Th-there's a woman I'd like you to see. She's very, very depressed. I think her depression is at the root of her sexual problems with her husband. You could really help her. I've been scaling back. I'm not really adding patients. Well, we talked about how great it would be to collaborate sometime, and this couple's perfect. Uh, marriage is on the rocks. I'll take the boy. You take the girl. We can confer and strategize, see if together we can help save their marriage. How's your wife? Ok. And your husband? Uh, th-the new one. He's my new ex. I moved out last weekend. Really? Just... Like that. Just like that. It's for the best. So what do you say? There's nothing else to say. Dan's gone off me. This is a waste of time. Ok, I feel like we're stuck. Melinda, I want you to see a colleague of mine. You're giving up on me? I want you to see Dr. Klink. He's something of a depression expert from the old school. What's a depression expert? What a cliché. First the affair in Denver. Then the red corvette. What's next, face-lifts and liposuction? "Desire fades." Pssh. That's a... Who is she? Hmm? Hmm? Is it your new receptionist? You think I need liposuction? You're not rehashing Denver, are you? Are you? Are you screwing Dr. Rice again?! No! There's no one! There w... We're not happy. Go to hell, Roger. Asshole. Door, please. Unsafe at any speed. Oh, the elevator? No, your corvette. "Unsafe at any speed." That's a corvair, "unsafe at any speed." It looks just like a corvette. Funky elevator. I try not to speak ill of it. I got stuck once. By yourself? Yeah. How boring. Heh. Is that why you carry a change of clothes? Oh, this. No. I left my wife just now, this morning. You're kidding. Is this your floor? Yes. I'm here to see Dr. Klick. He's an old-fashioned depression expert. You mean Dr. Klink? Yes. I'm Dr. Klink. You're Dr. Klink? Heh. You're kidding. I pictured a bald head, long face, pointy beard. Who called me old-fashioned? Dr. Paige. Y-you mean Emily? Well, anyway, I'll see you inside. Inside and out, I suppose. On the ins... ins... in... in my office. This is my door. Oh. Patients go in that door over there. Wait. Your tie's crooked. I guess your wife didn't check you before you left the house. Just go right in. Tuesday, June 16... Testing 1, 2. 1, 2. Test... goddamn. Dr. Klink. Yes? Your 9:45 is here. O... yes. Yes. Test 1, 2. 1, 2. Test 1, 2, 3. Shit. Sorry. Test 1, 2, 1, 2. Test... come in. It's very cold in here. Well, you'll need to... Remember a sweater. No, no. I meant the decor. It's... it's so blue. Alrighty. Mrs. Carmichael, would you like to sit here. Is that where you want me to sit? I don't want you to sit anywhere. I mean... I see. What happened to that friendly man I met on the elevator? Look, uh, we had an inappropriate debut, but I... is that what we had? Yes, we... please. So, um... Why are you here? I'm trying to save my marriage. Ah. I've been so depressed lately. I keep thinking it'll pass, but it doesn't. You're a little hangdog one morning. Then suddenly you're on a shrink's lap. Chair. Heh. Heh heh heh. Well, you don't... Seem very depressed right this moment. I'm not. I was. I almost didn't get off the elevator. It's pretty depressing to think you need to see a depression expert. My marriage expert's been divorced 3 times. You must be really depressed. Let's... Um, so, w-why don't you, um, tell me more about you? I'm married to a man who doesn't get turned on by me. Ah. Do you blame me? Why would I blame you? Not me. Uh, him. I... I di... I... I asked if you blamed your husband. No, you said, "me." "Do you blame me?" No, I di... I... I meant... Your husband, of course. Of course. Dan started sleeping in the living room on the couch that's the beginning of the end, don't you think? It certainly suggests a lack of intimacy. We stopped being intimate almost 2 years ago. I shouldn't tell you this. No, no. You just... no, no. Dr. Klink. No, no, no. I'm s... please, sit down. I... You can tell me anything that... Really. It's... One night, I get up to use the bathroom, and I looked in on Dan. He sleeps in his boxers, and it was a hot night, and the covers were off, and so I could see his... Mr. Happy. Mr. Happy? His thingy. His pe... uh, member. Peeking out. So I decided to try a little experiment to see if Dan was broken or if he'd just gone off me. An experiment? I snuck up... On my knees, and with my mouth, I... Kissed... Mr. Happy. Ohh. But when I tried to make love, he... his... It fizzled away when he woke up and realized it was me. Dan's gone off me. Desire fades. That... that is a depressing thought. Yes. It I... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm in a transitional phase in my life, and I... I'm not taking... taking on any more patients. But see, you helped me already. Really, I can't. If there were 2 shrinks in a small town and one was crazy and the other sane, which one would you go to see, the crazy one or the sane one? I've never heard of this one before. You'd go to the crazy one. 'Cause if there were only two in the town, you'd wanna see the one who helped the other one. O... you mean if there were just the two and they were each... I see. Dr. Klink, your 10:30's here. You hear that? Do you hear that? I mean, I... Would love to just sit... just to s-sit here and talk with you... All afternoon. But if I run even 5 minutes over on one session, my whole week could be thrown off. Hell, the rest of my life. You know... I'd gladly recommend to you someone else. Um, this is a list of qualified mental health professionals in Boise. Meli... Dr. Klink, what are you doing? I'm chasing after you. What about your 10:30? No, just... I just, uh... Well, I... I left my wife, and... Since you're not my... my patient and since this... Well, since this isn't my office, I... It's stuck again. Mmm. Dr. Klink... no. Roger. That was so therapeutic. Listen, we... you shouldn't call me Dr. Klink. It might give people the wrong impression. I... mmm. But I... I feel so free and open. I wish Dan had come with me. I mean, maybe he could benefit from your expertise. I don't feel depressed at all! Hello! Shh. Don't talk. Dispatch: Breaker 1-12... Uh... Are you folks ok? You seem flushed and out of breath. No. See you next week, Dr. Klink. Uh, Roger. I-I'm not actually her doctor. It's a... A figure of speech. Melinda: He's a genius. His method is so subtle. It sneaked right up on me. What did he do, exactly? He got me to talk. Sort of. How many sessions have you had? Just the one. What a man. He is a genius. Dan: Hey, uh, hi. What about my needs? Am I a part of this therapy stuff, or what? "Mas... mastering masturbation"? Oh, it's a wonderful guide... techniques, fantasy games, lubricants, all in historical context. Did you know that Edison was an avid masturbator? It's where he got his best ideas. No, e-Edison stole his best ideas. Whatever. Maybe it was Einstein. Heh heh. You look fabulous. Possible dissertation subject... orgasms and happiness. Why is it all the world seems rosy... It's Dr. Paige, regarding Melinda. I'll call her back. She's on her way in. You son of a bitch. I cannot believe what you did with Melinda Carmichael. She told you? Told me?! It's all over her face. I never took any money, and all I did was a preliminary interview, so technically she... it's absolutely wonderful. Really? Now the big challenge is to somehow get these 2 people to reconnect emotionally and sexually. Can I buy you lunch? Today? Uh... Well, I'm seeing Mrs. Carmichael. During lunchtime. Ohh! Oh, Dr. Klink, Roger. Roger. Call me Roger. Ohh. Ohh! Oh! Oh, Dr. Klink! Ohh! Look! Ohh! A helicopter. Wow. Maybe it was a transplant. What? The helicopter... Was carrying a little white ice chest with a red cross on it. Imagine waking up with a whole new heart, Dr. Klink. Please, call me Roger. Ohh. Danny and me used to have so much in common. Everything we did together was making love, not just sex, but cooking together. And then we took a trip to salt lake city, and he was like my... my big brother and my friend and... I... Lover all rolled into... I don't... ok. We have to talk. I just... I've gotta listen to patients all afternoon. I'm just trying to tell you... that I felt so good since last week's session that I told Danny about us. You what? Yes. You... you told your husband about us?! Ohh! Oh, my God! It was amazing and spontaneous, like we used to be. What the hell did I do to deserve this?! You screwed that cocktail waitress. But it wasn't spontaneous or amazing! Aah! You shouldn't have told him. But you... you talked about honesty. No. No, no, no. Dr. Paige talks about honesty. I'm still on the fence. Some lying is good. You didn't give him the details. Wow. Elevator sex. Damn. I've always admired Melinda's spunk. Larry! Now you're even, bro. How did he take it? He followed me here. He what? Shh, shh. Shh, shh. I don't notice... is... ahh? Oh, g... je... Melinda, I... it's over, you and me. It's... Dan needs you. He loves you. He followed you here. Isn't that romantic? Listen... Take what you've gotten out of our time together. Focus it back on Dan. Are you saying that as my lover or my therapist? Therapist. I mean, if I was your therapist, which I'm not, but... You know, we have nothing in common. This isn't a relationship based on mutual respect or understanding or common interests. It's based on sex. That's all. Ahh. Take it. Uhh. Oh, my God. We come from different worlds. I've got a phd, for God sakes. You probably barely graduated from high school. I have an a.A. From Boise community college and a... and a certificate of physical therapy! Exactly. The two of you are more suited. You're p-perfect for one anoth... go home to what's his... Dan. Mmm! Divorced? But you two were doing much better. I wish you'd never sent me to see Dr. Klink. Mmm. Therapy can be very intense. Especially oral therapy. Dan, don't be crass. Crass? It's pretty damn crass without me saying anything about it. You had... they had sex in an elevator. What? Who did? Dr. Klink and me. You slept with Dr. Klink in an elevator? Oh, yeah, they slept. Like a couple of dogs in heat, they slept. You're disgusting! At least I didn't have to bend over backwards to get him aroused. Oh, I thought that's exactly what you did do bastard! I wanted this to work out. Was the elevator your idea or his? Dan: Does it matter? Heh. You son of a bitch! In the elevator. In the elevator. Emily, it just happened. She wasn't technically my patient. Oh, save it for the board! You didn't tell the board. Of course I told the board. This is outrageous! Kindly keep your voice down. The amount is regulated by the bylaws. Specifically number 47 calls for fines of up to $25 for inappropriate behavior. Inappropriate behavior?! He was having sex with his patient in an elevator. Ah. She wasn't technically his patient. The minute she walked into his office, she was his patient. No, no. Technically she was your patient, Dr. Paige. My patient?! I think the fine is fair. I was fined 250 bucks for advertising on a bus bench. He's fined $25 for screwing in an elevator. Byline 17 is very specific with regards to permissible outdoor advertising. A hooker costs more than that. Dr. Paige, that's enough. It is more than enough. Who should I make the check out to? You hurt me, Roger. All you had to do was call me. Why didn't you just call me? I'm sorry, Emily. You will be. Heh. I really am sorry, Emily. Let bygones be bygones? Listen, Buster. You're not off the hook. You're going down. You will lose everything... money, your license. By the time this is over, you will never practice again. What are you gonna do? Nosta. Nosta. What the heck is a nosta? The national organization to stop therapist abuse. National? I don't know if this is the right thing to do. I really just want Danny back. We need to teach Dr. Klink a lesson. Danny. Hi, Mel. Ok, let me do all the talking. Wait, what law school was it you said you went to? Careful, toots. You're the one who sent my vulnerable sister-in-law into the arms of that Dr. Krink. It's klink, Larry, and shut up! You should have talked to me before you called anyone. We're gonna nail that son of a bitch. There she is. Consuela Ann barker, esquire, of barker, barker, beacons & Bauer, who represent nosta. I'm the second barker. You can call me Connie. You must be the victim. Lawrence p. Carmichael, esquire, a.B.D. I'll be handling all negotiations. We'll hear your proposal. Let me remind you you are the very first national abuse group we've contacted, so we're looking for a competitive preemptive figure which will act as a deterrent to other advocacy groups which we may be inclined to go. To. All but degree. My client... take a powder, Lawrence. This is a serious situation. You are way out of your league. Take your pet monkey with you. Just a second. That's my husband. I need to speak to you privately, without the peanut gallery. Connie: It's precisely these gray-zone cases that we must win. We need to send a message, a strong message. We'll have to prove the doctor took advantage of your fragile ego and lured you into psychosexual emotional bondage. Psycho what? He is a master manipulator. It is that quiet, lost puppy quality. I felt an attraction for Dr. Klink. Transference refers to strong feelings that the patient... you... erroneously transfers to a therapist... Dr. Klink... but which in fact originated out of earlier relationships. You mean like with my husband, maybe? Perhaps an even earlier relationship. Ahh. Hot. Melinda, where did this immoral congress transpire? Immoral congress? In a goddamn elevator. Elevator sex. Whew. And in his office. On his couch? And on the desk. Mmm. And why did you go to Dr. Klink in the first place? Dr. Paige sent me to him. She said he would take care of me the old-fashioned way. He's... he's a specialist, a depression expert. We met at a communication conference, and... we'll get it all in the deposition. My deposition? You're a key witness. Ok, let's, uh, skip the elevator for now. Take me through this couch coupling. Well, it's... it's a little embarrassing. Um, we started on the desk. Have you ever heard the name ezri stovall? He is the malpractice insurance go-to guy in this region. He rarely loses, never settles. He will be ruthless. Now, I know this is difficult, but it's important that you recall the exact details and specific sequence of events. Well, um, it's a little hazy, but I know he, Dr. Klink, went down on me. Cunnilingus. You ok? What else did he do? I went down on him. Fellatio! You know, I don't think we wanna play this oral sex card. It's illegal in this state. It is? It's sodomy. Oral sex is sodomy? "To carnally know any male or female person by the anus or mouth." It's a class-a misdemeanor. I don't wanna hurt Dr. Klink. I just wanted to save my marriage. Being with Dr. Klink made me realize how much Danny and me have in common. We will crush Dr. Klink. Look at you. My God, just look at you. Dr. Paige is right. You poor, pathetic woman. He's destroyed you. Nice shot. Hey. Hi. Mind if I sit? It's a free bar. Heh heh. That lady lawyer thinks a divorce would be great for our case. I don't want a divorce, Mel. No? No. I... I just want you to stop seeing him. I'm not seeing him. So you don't want to split up? No. No, not at all. We can't split up, Mel. You and I, we're like... we're like a team. Siegfried & Roy, hall & oates, ham and cheese. I'm sorry I strayed, but you kind of opened the door. I wanted to talk to you about that. The truth is, Mel, I... shh. Let's not talk about it. Water down the drain, Dan. Water down the drain. Hey, how's that divorce coming? Uh, please, counsel, let's not lose sight of the human element in this tragedy. You know, a divorce would really help our case. I'm working on it. This is Joel Johnson Jr. He's with beerquist, angsthall & Cox. Joel is our point man here in... Boise. Boise. Boise. Joel's come up with a figure. How much money were you hoping to see? $30,000. Heh. Million. It's $30 million. $30 million? $30 million? You've hit the jackpot, Melinda. Whoo-hoo! Yeah. Dr. Klink doesn't have $30 million. No, Dr. Klink has malpractice insurance, and they've got $30 million. Emily: Dear God. I had no idea it would be so much. There's not a better person she could have screwed. Except her priest. Catholics pay a shitload of money to keep this kind of crap down. I'm gonna get $30 million for having sex with Dr. Klink? In an elevator. And on his desk. $30 million. Minus 30% contingency, 50% if we win on appeal. How much more do you think a divorce might net? Why the hell are you suing me? Um... Because... You took advantage of my fragile ego and got me in a psychoemotional, sexual thing. What? Why don't you take a walk, klink, before I call the cops. Oh, if it isn't the erectionless wonder, Mr. Happy! You told him about Mr. Happy? Dr. Klink, I told you that in therapy. First of all, it's Roger. Secondly, it wasn't therapy. You were never my patient. Why don't you tell it to the judge, Mr. Majestic? You told him about Mr. Majestic? Dan is my husband. I tell him everything. Are you screwing yet? There's more to our relationship than sex. There better be with Mr. Limpy here. You son of a... Unh! Danny! Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey. Come on. Come on. I hope you fight better than... aah! Aah! Let go! No. Come on, honey. Come on. Why'd you have to tell him about Mr. Happy? It's ok. He's a doctor. Don't sue me, Melinda. I'll lose my license. It's all I have. I'm sorry. Good-bye, Dr. Klink. Come on. Roger. Call me Roger. Ezri stovall will crush her like a bug. We've gotta nip this kind of frivolous litigation in the bud. People have to start taking responsibility for their actions. Why'd you stop sleeping together? Makes it seem like you thought you were doing something wrong. It was an absolute taboo. A therapist can never have sex with a patient. The moment you two screwed, she became your lover, thereby making it impossible for her to ever be your patient. Where'd you bone her? We made love in an elevator. Elevator sex. I... pssh. You're kidding me. I'm in elevators all the time. I know. I'm sorry. How long would something like that take? It was over pretty quickly. Mechanical failure? Oh, no. She hit the stop. Or, uh, m-maybe I did. Is this really important? Every detail is important. You need booze? Juries are fickle. Something could come out at the trial, and you'll be screwed. Any witnesses? Other passengers? No, of c... no, of course not. How about a surveillance camera? Oh, Jesus. Well, there may not be one if the elevator's old enough. Please, God. Ok, so, you're ballin' her. Did you ejaculate? W... uh, is there any way not to? Not that I've found. Did she mention any other therapists she's slept with? Other members of the hippocratic arts? Orthodontists? Podiatrists? Clergy? I don't know. I don't think so. What about you? How many other nonpatient patients have you banged? None. You banging your receptionist? Tiff... no. Well, let ezri stovall get to work. Clammy. Heh heh heh heh heh heh. Don't answer it, baby. Oh. Hello. Helen, ezri. Hi. What's up? I've got something for you. You free? Available. Never free. Ha ha! Never give it away, baby. Is that that sumbitch stovall? She's spoken for! Shh. This is business. Ahh. Ahh. I'm defending a headshrinker who put his pecker where he shouldn't have. And she's suing him. Bingo. D-don't get it, baby. Please. Hold on. We haven't worked in a month. I can't... I'm gonna... Oww! Oh. Hello. Is Felix Potter in? He sure is. Ahh. Goddamn. Yeah, hello. Felix Potter. Uh-huh. Connie barker out of Chicago. Joel Johnson of beerquist, angsthall & Cox gave me your number. Uh-huh. I'm looking for a private investigator. I'm representing the victim in a therapist abuse case. What do you got, ezri? I need to find out if there's anything in his past that might hurt us. We're just starting depositions. Ahh. Ahh. Ezri and Connie: What's the matter? Nothing. Nothing. Radio. Connie: His name is klink, Roger klink. She's Melinda Carmichael. The shrink is Roger klink. Dr. Klink? Yep. What's her name? Connie and Helen: Melinda Carmichael. We're on the same case. Ezri: You'll get your usual fee, Helen. I'd like to put you on a retainer, Felix. I need some dirt on Dr. Klink. Uh-huh. Fax me everything you got. Uh-huh. Ok, ezri? I gotta go. I'm there. Interesting. 50 bucks an hour, plus expenses. Fax me at this number. Fax me. Fax... ahh! We're working the same job again. You show me yours, I'll show you mine. Ezri: Have you ever had your deposition taken before, Mrs. Carmichael? No. Do you understand that your testimony here today is given under oath and done just like in court? So despite the informal setting, you are testifying under penalty of perjury. I'm sorry. The tape jammed. I'll need a minute. It's his first day. Is he gonna be here every day? It's his right. Videographer: Got it. Now, Mrs. Carmichael, were you carnally intimate with Roger klink? Carnally intimate? Sexually intimate. Melinda: Um, I guess so. I mean, we had sex. Would you please describe in specific detail the first of these decorous unions with Roger klink? Indecorous unions, counsel. Consenting adults engaged in fornication... what could be more decorous, counsel? How about if, for the purposes of this deposition, we let the noun stand alone, unqualified? Union, plain and simple. Fine. Mrs. Carmichael, would you please walk me through this initial union? What? Mr. Stovall would like you to describe your first encounter with Dr. Klink. Roger klink. He is a doctor, counsel. Yes, counsel, but not her doctor. How about if, for the purposes of this deposition, we let the klink stand alone, unqualified? Fine. Mrs. Carmichael, when you're ready. Well, we had, um... Sex in the elevator of his building between floors. And would you describe this union as standard? What are you getting at, counsel? I'm trying to establish the mode by which they carnally expressed themselves. Oh, you mean the way in which they were carnally expressive. Precisely. Missionary? Front door? Back door? Roundy-round? Were you prostrate? Plumb? Ingénue? Cou... well, he, um... He, um... Stopped the elevator, and we just kind of moved at each other. Uh... Did he stop the elevator, or did you? One of us did. I-it's a little hazy. Ok, but you made the first move. You're leading the plaintiff, counsel. We both moved at the same time, grabbed at each other. Doct... he was very excited. Klink told you he was excited? No. But... but I could feel his... Well, his... Mr. Happy was pressing up against me. Mr. Happy? Well, that's what my husband calls his... Johnson. Yes, counsel? Not you. I'm, uh, referring to. Melinda's husband's Johnson. Klink's Johnson... klink's penis. Could we stay focused on klink's penis and not the husband's? Uh, Mrs. Carmichael, perhaps there's another term we could use to describe Roger klink's penis. Mr. Majestic. That's what he calls it. Why didn't you tell me your pecker has a name? Ehh... and that she knows it? I didn't think it would come up, so... ohh! I, uh... Had an affair 3 years ago. I mean, it was a doctor in Denver. It was a seminal relationship. If I hadn't had the affair, I never would've bought the corvette or left my wife. Are you still seeing him? Him? No. It was a... a her. Uh, she, doctor. Oh, right. It doesn't have any bearing on this case. It better not. Back on the record, please. Ok, so you could feel Dr. Majestic. I think it's Mr. Majestic, counsel. Right. Uh, you could feel Mr. Majestic pressing up against you. What happened next? Um, we started kissing and grabbing, and he was bumping himself up against me, kissing my neck, and... He slid his hands under my blouse and was caressing my breasts in circles, tiny, little circles. And one thing led to another, and I just... Took Mr. Majestic, um... In my mouth. Ehh. Both: You son of a bitch! Dan: Aah! Whaah! Dr. Paige! Danny! Danny! Danny, stop! You son of a bitch! How dare you?! How dare you?! Melinda: Dr. Klink, are you ok? Emily: You son of a bitch! Ok, I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right now. Out! Out! Out! I'm sorry. Ahh! You pathetic, immature peckerwoods! Oh, the hilarity. She kissed his pee-pee. Grow up! This is serious goddamn business! Salacious, yes. Scandalous, of course. Titillating, possibly. But my client's career hangs on. Ms. Barker's client's most intimate testimonial. Get out and stay out until it's time for your depositions! My... why would I need to do one? Because you're the flaccid bastard that started this whole mess. Now beat it! He's... that's... ditto! Amscray! I'm... I'm going. Beautifully expressed, counsel. Oh, yeah. That shit's hot. Shut up, Larry! You're not looking at the big picture. The 3, zero, zero zero, zero, zero, zero, zero dollar picture. Enough. Enough! Give it a rest. Give it a rest, Larry, ok, please? This is all your fault. My fault? You're the one that sent... you're the one that sent my wife to that sex fiend. I'll catch you later, bro. I, uh... I... I forgot something. Well, maybe if you'd been able to deliver the goods, your wife wouldn't have been so damn horny that she threw herself on Dr. Klink in a goddamn elevator! Fuck you, Dr. Paige! Fuck me. How you gonna do that, Dan, with Dr. Klink's help? No. Heh. Hey, we came to you guys 'cause we wanted help. We wanted to save our marriage. You guys are supposed to be professionals. You guys don't know anything! You wanna know why you can't get an erection with Melinda? Hey. Hey, not so loud. No protection, no erection. No diaphragm, Mr. Happy gets sad. Wife wants children. Husband doesn't. Wife forces the issue. It is a classic Venus and Mars dynamic. Now, generally we like patients to come to certain conclusions on their own. But what the hell? There it is, free of charge. I'm not ready to be a father. Great! And what does Melinda say? We don't ever talk about it. We use birth control. What is there to say? Isn't that what marriage is, you know, uh, knowing without saying? Fantasyland, Dan. All relationships are killed by dishonesty, repressed feelings, things left unsaid. Honesty first. "No protection, no erection." You're good. I'm the best. No protection, no erection. Mm-hmm, yeah. Back on the record, please. I'm trying to picture this. Y-you were kneeling? No. I was standing up, bent over, with him in my mouth. So, he was a passive participant? No. His hand was under my skirt, and he started to touch me... Rub my... Mrs. Happy. Yes, and, um, let's see. With his other hand, he was still touching my breast... Very gently, slowly tracing tiny circles around my nipple, around and around... Around and around and up and down on Mrs. Happy. Up and down... And around and around. Off the record a second. Uh, counsel, excuse me. Would you mind... Would you object to a 10-minute recess? Quite the contrary, counsel. I'm just trying to tell the truth. You're making it sound like you had wonderful sex with a terrific lover. We're trying to sue him, remember? We're not writing an erotic novel. That circle stuff sounded great. Where'd you come up with that circle business? Circle business? Around her nipple? ¶ Round and round ¶ ¶ up and down ¶ ¶ Round and round and up and down ¶ ¶ and a 1, 2, 3 ¶ ¶ kick, 1, 2, 3 ¶ ¶ kill 'em ¶ hoo. Heh. Excuse me. Heh heh. Nice... nice camerawork. Here. I thought they kicked you out of here. "Lawrence Carmichael, esq." It's esquire. Attorney. You're a lawyer? How would you kids like to earn a little extra scratch on the side? Scratch? Time sort of stood still. I remember becoming aware of pounding and people's voices... Hello! And then the phone started to ring, And that's when he, uh... Put his, uh... Mr. Majestic. Into my... Mrs. Happy. And there was this pounding and shouting and ringing, and we got into this amazing rhythm. It was all over in about a minute, minute and a half. Did klink arrive at emission? Yes. I wasn't using any protection, so at the last minute, we pulled apart, and I finished him with my hand. You did? Yes, and the other time, too. Really? Off the record for a second. Is it hot in here, counsel? Mm-hmm-hmm. It's almost 11:00. Uh, I'd like to break early for lunch. This is the first day of deposition. Given the exhaustive nature of today's testimony, I... perhaps a discontinuation... Is counsel requesting a recess? What would counsel's inclination be to such a request? R-request granted. Uh... Does counsel have plans for lunch? Counsel's going back to the hotel for a cold shower. Howdy, ezri. Howdy, partner. How are you? Oh. Heh. You've got a great memory for details. It's like being on truth serum in there. Everything comes flooding out. Melinda, why are you suing me? It's... this is so humiliating for both of us, and if it goes to trial, this... everyone in Boise will find out about... It. I think I'm gonna drop the suit. I don't wanna go any further with it. What? R-really? No. Uh, y-you should get... Something. Do you love me, Dr. Klink? S... Do I love you? Yes. Do you love me? I could love you. Could? Thanks, ezri. Get that bite looked at. What is it with you and elevators? You know, it's... take the goddamn stairs. I wanted to talk to you. You know, maybe we could... I mean, I was thinking we... I... I really wanna settle out of court, if... Aah! Eesh. Let me set you straight. First, ezri stovall has never settled. Well, that's fine... he either wins... Or he goes down kicking and biting. 2... 2! Ezri stovall makes the recommendation to the insurance company to go to court, to settle, et cetera. If you don't heed his advice, you will be settling on your own, without the insurance company. Uh, I have malpractice insurance. Ehh. Fine print, elevator boy. Your policy guarantees you a defense. It doesn't say it'll pay out if you lose or if it finds that you have acted criminally... Criminally? I never acted criminally. Or unethically... She wasn't even my patient. Or if you decide to... and I quote... "if you decide to act against insurance carrier's appointed counsel." You mean if I settle, I pay? Yep. Dan: Hey, Mel. Hey, hey, uh... I got you some arby's. Thanks. Hey. Ok. I've been thinking, Mel. I know what our problem was. Me, too. You cheated with that cocktail waitress. I didn't cheat with the co... I mean, I was gonna, but I didn't. You lied to me about sleeping with her. You and I weren't exactly... because you couldn't... I couldn't because you wanted a baby, all right? Dr. Paige spelled it all out for me. No protection, no erection. I just wasn't ready yet, but hell, if you really want a baby, we'll have one. I don't care, especially with the money we got coming in. I don't wanna make a baby, not yet. Yeah, you do. No, I don't. Yes, you do. Dr. Paige said it was classic the way you lost your diaphragm. Well, she's wrong. I didn't lose it. I just didn't use it, because you wanted me to get pregnant. I wanted you to get pregnant? Yes. No, you... no, wait. You wanted to get pregnant. No way. I am not ready to have a baby. You're not. Uh-uh. That means together we're both not ready. You don't understand. This is awesome! Oh, my God, I thought if I even mentioned that I didn't want to have kids, you'd divorce me. Really? Yeah. Me, too. Oh, my God. Honesty first. That's the key. I feel like a weight's been lifted. That Dr. Paige is a genius. I love you, Mel. I love you, Danny. I missed you holding me and holding my hand and touching my back. This is what I wanted all along. Me, too. Oh, we could do this every day if we want. We could do this all day, every day, whenever we want. With the money we got coming in, we could do whatever we want. You should see the... the things. Larry has lined up... the brochures, the... the telemarketing, uh, opportunities. The... the real estate invest... there's fun stuff, too... jai alai and, you know, boxing. What's Larry have to do with any of this? Well, he's our... he works for us. You know, he quit his job. Larry's never had a job. No, he has one now, 'cause he works for us. He's gonna get 10% of whatever we win. This isn't a jackpot, Dan. This is our life. Look, I was stupid before, ok? I was really dumb. You go in there. You say whatever you have to say. It's just words to me now, baby. I don't even care... where you going? I want out! I want it all to go away... the doctors and the lawyers and you! Me?! What did I do? I don't like you, Danny! You're a big, bad devil! What? What'd I do? Connie: No! No! Ohh! You wanna drop the lawsuit?! Yes. It's not worth it. I never liked this case to begin with. Oh, this one looked better on paper. Mmm. Fine. Fine. Just write us a check for all our out-of-pocket legal fees. Fine. How much will that be? Joel: Well, let's see. We have Ms. Barker's fees, plus expenses and per diem, times 10 days, plus first-class airfare and her support staff in Chicago. Then of course there's me and my staff here in Boise, plus one private detective at $50 an hour, plus xeroxing, postage, various office expenses. Comes to just under $75,000. $75,000? Just under. I don't have that kind of money. Guess we'll stay the course. Never forget you're the victim here. Hmm. Tiff... who are you? Wh-where's Tiffany? Oh. Helen dalrymple, private investigator. Your receptionist let me in. Look, I-I don't know who you work for, but could... I work for you, asshole. Ezri stovall hired me. Is Dr. Rice in this picture? Come again? That's what she said. Heh heh. Look, ezri said you banged some shrink at a conference. He... Dr. Rice. Are you still in contact with her? Uh, no. Dr. Rice is no longer in the picture. She... could... please... could you please not touch my... or Tiffany's things? Did Ms. Carmichael mention any other affairs? Other doctors she screwed? Dentists, podiatrists, clergy? Clerg... no. I mean, I told Mr. Stovall everything, and anything she told me is confidential. Right. Don't wanna abuse that doctor-patient relationship. Wait, wait. I... Must insist that you leave. Don't get lippy with me, doc. I didn't screw my patient. She w... Heh. In an elevator? Are you kidding me? Ha ha! We are talking about stodger Roger, right? Heh. Good, old Mr. By the book. Ah heh heh. You know, when I met him, he was a 23-year-old virgin, and, uh, the morning after we had sex for the first time, I get a call out of the blue from an ex-boyfriend who proposes to me. Really? Roger, bless his heart, in a fit of jealousy, jumps up and says, "I would marry you." Years later, I found out what he meant... Was "could," not "would." So, what, you got married on a grammatical error? All I know is, um... We were never very happy. Uh, has he had many affairs, your husband? Well, there was that otapi conference in Denver a couple of years ago. Otapi. That's some kind of antelope, right? What? Otapi, the organization of therapists, analysts, blah, blah, blah. Come on. Right. I shouldn't be telling you any of this. I've had too many of these. Darlin', uh... You could tell me anything. Well... He comes back from Denver, and he's a changed man. All of a sudden, he is Mr. Oral sex. Up until then, Roger had very rarely, uh... Cunnilinged me. Can you say, uh, "cunnilinged"? Well, I don't know. What's the verb for cunnilingus? Cunnilingated. Stop it. Cunnilingual. That a verb? I don't know, but I like it. Anyway, he comes back from Denver, and suddenly he's an expert. Oh, yes. He's slow. He's sensual. He's circular. Am I boring you? Not a bit. Salty. Oh, and he started doing this, um, this circle thing, you know, with the... with his hands on my... on my breasts, kind of like... like that. Really? Yeah. Whoa. Heh. And, uh... Wow. I let the whole thing drop, and then, uh, oh, about 5, 6 months later, he got a card in the mail from a Dr. Rice. Looked like an invitation. Who's Dr. Rice? Exactly what I said, you know, very nicely, and, uh, Roger got very flustered. And stammered something about it obviously being addressed to the wrong Dr. Klink. Is Dr. Rice a boy doctor or a girl doctor? A girl doctor. Are you sure? Heh. Well, who else but a girl could have taught him all those good things that he knew? Well, thank you... Heh. For your help. We, um... we are separated, you know. Mmm. Uh, do you live alone? I, um... Have a roommate. But, uh, listen, uh, here's my card, and, uh, if you can think of anything else, why, uh, you can call me. Oh. Day and night. Thank you. Ma'am. I'll see you. No! What's going on? Good morning, counsel. Hi, counsel. How's it hanging? Connie: Better put that animal of yours in a cage, or I'll have to get a restraining order. Ezri: Your client has violated rules regarding ex parte propinquity. I'll squeeze in here with you. Let's take the stairs. I get an erection just thinking about elevators. We were by the door, standing up. He was hugging me, moving his hands over my dress and then under my dress. I wasn't wearing any underwear. Oh, baby! Hey, Dan, over here. Hey. Hey, Larry, what's up? You seen Melinda? Haven't seen her, bro. But you don't think this money's goin' to her head, do you? No, I don't think so. In fact, I don't even think she's 100% into the whole thing. We were talking last... last... is... this is... Larry, this is Melinda naked. I took her head off last year's Christmas card, downloaded the body off the Internet. The rest is the magic of Photoshop. But goddamn, Larry, she's still naked. I-it's not her body. With sexy artwork on the video box, I can get double per unit. What are you talking about? Yee-ha! I put my hands in his pants. Oh, my God. Larry... ok, that's my little surprise. Melinda is hot, bro. Is that... are those... would you look at this crowd? Heck, we could sell her deposition tapes to every bar in town. I've got a buddy in salt lake working on the website. Wha... Larry, I am trying to get back with her. ...being up on his desk, on all fours. Whoo! Whoo! Larry, have you seen your brother? Speak of the devil. Hey, Melinda. What's this? Don't worry. It's not your body. Boo-yah. Why don't we turn it off, huh? I think the game's on. ...his other hand, he was very gently... That's me on TV. ...around and around and around and up and down on... Mrs. Happy! Mrs. Happy! Turn it off! Turn it off! Whoo hoo! Whee-hah! Danny? Uh, oh, Mel, oh, shit. How could you? I didn't. I swear. How could you? I didn't. Mel, I swear. Mel, I swear to God I didn't. Mel. All right, look, why don't we... look, that's my wife! Can we please turn it off? Hey! Hey, everybody! It's Mr. Happy! Hey, come on, buddy! Hey, hey, hey... the best part! Get down, now! Get him off of there. Get off me! Unh! Yes. You're kidding. That's not so bad. When? Good idea. Time is of the essence. Get hold of Dr. Paige and warn her. No, no. I-I'll convey the message to Mr. Stovall. What's up? Good news for our team. Carmichaels are splitting up for good. Melinda's at some hotel by the highway. She's very upset. I'd like to give her a day's rest. Johnson thinks we should move on to Dr. Paige's deposition. I'm not sure I'm prepared for Dr. Paige. Ezri... It would mean an awful lot to me. Max, you ever think about the other road, the one you didn't walk down? The one you stood at the mouth of, but were afraid to walk down, afraid to... Let down your hair and run? Ah, I'm waxing rhetorical, not looking for an answer, just a little... Anonymous companionship. Here, doc, compliments of the ladies at the end of the bar. It's the corvette, Max. The women love it. To Dr. Majestic. Women: Dr. Majestic. Who told you that? That's con... that's confidential uh, doctor-cli... uh, attorney... Ahh! Ahh. Hey, doc, you forgot your picture. Oh. Man: ¶ bingo was his name-o... ¶ hi. Uh, is Felix in? He's in the shower. Oh, you're the roommate. Oh, ha ha ha! He said he had a roommate. I totally for... Did he? And you must be... I'm... I'm Jennifer. I'm, uh, the almost ex-Mrs. Dr. Klink. Right. And you're here because... Well, ah heh heh. I have a very valuable piece of evidence to help screw my future ex-husband, and, um... I'd really like to give it to Felix. Well, we're not just roommates. We're partners. Oh. Perfect. Ok. So what happened is a got a call from Max, the bartender down at the wild bill lounge. He didn't know Roger and I had split, so he called the house, and, uh... heh. Looky what my husband left behind-y in the bar. I've seen this picture before. What's the big deal? Wh... that's Dr. Rice next to my husband. Ex! Ex-husband. Uhh! Ex-husband. I mean, look at their hands. It's... That's Dr. Rice? "To a great orator, love, E.R." Dr. Rice taught Roger the, uh, cunnilingual arts, as Felix put it. Isn't that funny? Ha ha ha ha! Is that how he put it? ¶ There was a farmer had a dog ¶ ¶ and bingo was his name-o ¶ ¶ nn-nn-nn-nn-dog... ¶ does Felix take long showers? We're lovers, not just partners. Oh, yes. Ok. Well, I never would have, uh, ahem, I mean, look at me. It's... A lot of fringe and... ok. Well, he'd... he'd called you his roommate, just... just so you know that. Sorry. Oh, that's ok. That's ok. This, um... this is an Idaho chardonnay, if you wanna... I'm gonna go. Uh, keep the photo. Keep this. Heh. And, uh... Bust his balls for me, would you? Don't worry. This better be good. I found a picture of klink with Dr. Rice. Meaningless. Good-bye. Guess who Dr. Rice is. Really? Are you sure? Positive. I'll call you back. Conthuela, that was amathing. That was a class-a misdemeanor. My dear... That was a felony. You know what I hate? I hate that one of us has to lose. I wish we could both win. Ohh. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ha. Ah ha! Ha ha ha! Ezri: Exhibit "a" is a group photograph from the otapi shrink convention, Denver, 1999. Do you recognize the woman standing next to Roger klink? Of course I do. Would you please read what's written on the back of the photo. "To a great orator, love, E.R." Who's E.R.? Emily rice. Ezri: Who is Emily rice? Me. I am. Uh... I was. My second former husband was Eugene rice. What did you mean, "a great orator"? It's double entendre. It... no big deal. It refers to oral sex. We had a fling in Denver. We hardly left the room for 3 days, although it was more of a workshop, considering Roger was a sexual fledgling. I object! It's the truth. I tutored him in various sexual techniques. Granted, he... he was a quick learner. He made the greatest strides in the oral disciplines, hence "a great orator." Oral? You and Dr. Klink? I named his penis Mr. Majestic. To boost his confidence. Oh, Jesus... oh, God! Oh, man. Should I go off record? Don't you dare. I showed him everything. I crammed 6 months of training into 3 days. Oh, and we had an elevator in Denver. You two had sex in an elevator? Well... well, he was too timid. "What if someone comes? I'm so scared." You were like a supercharged sex instructor! A square-dance caller! "Roll over. "Rub here. Touch this. On your back. On your knees." Uhh! It was like sexual boot camp. You loved it, and then you have the nerve to share my advanced circle technique with her. Those circles are mine! I gave him that technique. But that's all it is to you, technique and disciplines, maneuvers. I mean, if you had just shut up once during the whole weekend and let me be me, I might never have gone back to my wife. You should've told me, Dr. Paige. It had no bearing. You pressed me to sue him. You wanted to nail the bastard. You used me to get back at Dr. Klink! How could you? You, you stole the circles from Dr. Paige! Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. No, no! I was trying to help! You used Mrs. Carmichael, a broken woman. Who was unable to defend herself from the advances of this sexual predator. Predator? He's a leaf-eater, a sexual herbivore. I object. Th... a predator created by Dr. Paige. Oh, but then... but then her creation spurned her. So you set out to destroy him, and this innocent woman just got in your way. None of this is true! You have ruined my life, Dr. Paige. My marriage is over, Dan's become a greedy asshole, and his shit brother is selling the deposition tapes at local bars! Wha... I did it! Oh, you're fired. You can't fire her. She's pregnant. Uhh. The tapes are meaningless now. Remember your wish last night, consuela? Last night? That both of us could win this case. That isn't possible, but I've come up with the next best thing. First, you drop your suit against klink. Do what? Drop the suit? Never! You file a suit on behalf of Mrs. Carmichael and klink, the real victims in this case, against the real villain, the conniving and vengeful Dr. Paige. This'll never hold up in court. It won't have to. You'll settle out of court for 5 million, which the company will agree to. And Melinda and klink will split 5 million. Minus 30%. Everyone's a winner. Well, not everyone. According to the settlement, Dr. Paige will lose her license. Lose my license? But there is an island in the Caribbean where you do not need a license to practice the psychiatric arts. Ahh! Grand Cayman. The Caribbean? Brilliant. It's a happy ending. You are the greatest. Ezri: Come here, you big lug. Melinda, Roger, congratulations! We won! We're rich! Emily: This is insane! I won't agree. I wanna speak to my attorney. I'm your attorney. Every shrink in the great state of Idaho has the same malpractice plan and the same lawyer, ezri stovall. As your attorney and the one voice the insurance company listens to, I recommend we settle out of court. But... but you never settle out of court. I will for you. Love means making sacrifices. I'm sorry, Emily. Would you like some champagne? No? Melinda? Aah! Goddamn lawyers and doctors, go to hell! Melinda? Melinda, wait! Ahh! Gahh! Roger! Wait! Roger! Roger! Roger! And when did you come up with all of this? After you fell asleep. I fell asleep? Mm-hmm. So we didn't... No. I missed it. I took the liberty of rescheduling you for 3:00. It's time! T-time? Uh-huh. The baby. Ohh. Melinda! I'll follow. Roger! Roger! Get back here! Pull over! We need to talk! Ohh! Roger! Roger! Brother, Emily. Roger! Roger, for the love... Come on. Come on. Go away! Ohh! Guhh. Ok. All right. Listen, I must've been crazy to risk losing you, ok? Screw the money. Screw the lawyers. Screw Larry. Sc-screw the shrinks. I j... I just want you. I'm begging you, please. I'm begging you. I need you. We're a team, remember? Siegfried & Roy, ham and cheese. You don't care about the money? I don't need money to be happy, Mel. I just need you. That's it. I missed you so much. Kiss me. I lied to you. I didn't throw my diaphragm away or lose it. You didn't? It's here in my purse. And do you... do you have any of that, uh, sauce? Spermicidal gel? Say it again. Spermicidal gel. Go get it, Mel. We're in business. Mr. Happy! Let's not call it that anymore. What should we call it?! I'll think of something. Let's... come on. Ok, ok. All right. All right. I'll be right back. Oh, my God. Oh, God. Heh heh. Oh, my God. Oh, I love birth control. Heh heh heh. Why are you laughing? We're rich. There was a settlement, and we get almost $2 million. We're rich. Yeah. Ah. We can afford one of those tract houses. Mm-hmm. Dan: Oh, God. Oh, God! Oh, God! Melinda, are you all right?! Oh, God. Danny, it's him! And that's how we got here. Klink, Paige, rice. Need a goddamn program. Yeah. Deputy: Hey. Turn that damn thing off. All right, I've had about enough. Get yourself in position near the door. We're going in. Deputy: Here. Thank you, little lady. Dan: Hurry! Oh, God! I love you, Danny! I love you, too, baby! Wait! Let me try talking to them. Melinda, on bullhorn: Dr. Paige. Dr. Klink. Honesty first, right? I mean, Dr. Paige, what do you want from Dr. Klink, and vice versa? Danny and me took your advice. We were finally honest with each other. It worked. Yeah, a-all relationships are killed by, uh, dishonesty, repressed feelings, things left unsaid... things like that, you know? Come on, you guys. Honesty first, huh? Emily, I wanted to be with you so bad, I was sick after the otapi conference. Roger, I want you. I've wanted to be close to you since Denver. It's all I've ever wanted. My wife and I were married because of a grammatical misunderstanding. She thought I proposed. I only meant. I could hypothetically marry her. I only married Mr. Paige to make you jealous. I... I fantasized that you would burst into the church and stop it. That was my fantasy. I wanted to, but I was afraid. Oh, Roger, let's start over, honesty first. I... I was thinking there's gotta be a need for couples counseling on grand Cayman, right? That's what I was thinking. I love you, Emily. Ohh. I love you, Roger. Aah! Don't shoot me! Oh, God! Danny! Aah! Aah! Medic: What the? Melinda! Melinda! Melinda! Go evasive! Go evasive! Are you shot? No. It's champagne. Champagne? Get in there, trousdale. Aw, shit. Careful, trousdale. Well? Ohh. Ohh, in circles. Ohh. The crisis will be resolved in about 30 seconds, sir. Goddamn it, you two better hold on tight this time. There isn't anybody else in the world that could love you. Yes, sir. Heh. Don't worry. Consuela, we're just getting started. God, I love a happy ending. Lucky Larry's lift. Come down and get lucky. Captioning made possible by lions gate entertainment
