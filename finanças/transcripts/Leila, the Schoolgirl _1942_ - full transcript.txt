Go on Then he got engaged to her and after 6 months he had to marry her He got her a great villa, and they sent the wedding invitations out On the day of the wedding... What happened? He discovered that she was betraying him with a worthless guy I knew from the start, but no one could tell him a thing What an disloyal woman, and then? Then, the result was that he stayed in hospital for 2 months for congestion of the mind and he forbade women entering the house Then loneliness and depression and then, Its now 10:00 and you should go to bed Goon Tell me, was she pretty? Who? Yes, from that aspect, yes She was really pretty, Adorable Her eyes, each eye that big Her nose was like that and her hair... Oh! Go on, go to sleep Goodnight!

Yes you did Madame, but the Master forbids us from opening any window Why? Is he still asleep? No, Hes up since dawn Hes working in the office Working? Fine, never mind, open the windows As you wish Thats it Ibrahim Yes Madame Prepare a vase on the table Yes Madame Good morning, What is this? What is this darkness? Take these Whats the matter? Sunlight is better than light bulbs Dont open the window Why? Because l... Fine, open it Thats it, one must breathe in the beautiful morning air Take the vase and put the flowers in it, I want to have breakfast Put them, What are you scared of? Give me, Youre useless The only thing you know how to do is to lock yourself in the office It drives me mad! You open your appetite when you eat with flowers in front of you What is this? Who told you to open the windows? The young lady is the one... I told him, Is there a problem? No, no problem What is this? Did you still put a chair on the Westside and Eastside?

If Zahia, the woman you loved, had died... I might have respected your reason But to bury yourself alive because of such a disloyal woman? This is called madness, On the contrary, you must be happy because you discovered the betrayal of this bitch before marrying her Layla Yes, The bitch... Imagine the scandal and torture that would have taken place... if you had discovered her betrayal after you married her You must thank God, Youre young True you wasted 10 years over this useless love of yours, but still, you are young and you can make up for it Life is beautiful and full of joys God created it for us to enjoy why are you looking at me?
