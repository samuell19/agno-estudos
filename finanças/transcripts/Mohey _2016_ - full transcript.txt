As a consequence of the nuclear sanctions... The owners of some companies took fraudulent action... In order to establish illegal international relationships The corruption resulting from their money and power affected the lives Iranians This film is based on true stories God I remember in the damp children's home... Next to my twin They taught us about the punishment of the sins we mustn't commit You said eye is the entire being of a human Humans are just like God himself So the pupil is God's eye? If you decide to see the world you'll see it through our eyes It was then I found out the person whose eyes we see, deserves care We should stop torturing or killing him That's why when they want to execute someone they close their eyes So we don't see them Since if we do, we have to stop So God... If you see the torture I'm under Why won't you help me? Could you put it out please? -You don't smoke? -I quit I don't know you -You know all your clients closely? -Not all When I was a kid, my mother pinned one of those to my sleeve She said it drives evil away No one believes this sort of thing anymore I do care -It's a part of me, Nabavi -That's not me I know -He'd promised things -I sent him to China I don't think he'll be back anytime soon I can give you his address so he can live up to his promises We were after you actually I have a case you can solve at the moment I don't remember a case with your name A president changes and nothing happens How long haven't you been around for? Things have changed -How long were you away for? -67 years How was Sour? Have we worked together before? Releasing products from Nabati He's the most ignorant person I've ever seen I can tell what he's thinking in his damn head He pretends I'm insignificant... But I know exactly how to get twhrough to him -Right what do you want Mohey? -Mehrnia We sent money to a French company's account for medical equipment Who's half Iranian, we sent 300 million Euros to his account As the upfront, we were supposed to send the rest the following day On the day the company's account had 700 million Euros in there -And the products were blocked -What do you want from me? Release it I can't step forward to resolve it Or a charitable rich man -We only release products here -People say other things Who Nabavi? Ask him to do it for you With what we know of you, I'm sure you can manage it What's your product? -Beauty implants -Do you have time or not? We have to release it onto the market until June -Will it take long? -We need other things other than time -Like what? -I have to investigate Your account in France and so many other things -Does all the money belong to the company -It's all in there How did the money get there? Where did the money come from, where did it go? Do you have a lawyer? The necessary paperwork -I have to know all of it -We're in a hurry Did I accept for you to ask me to hurry up? For me it's like opening and empty giftbox I'll ask my lawyer to send you the details We'll be in touch Bye for now Go through all the files, see if you find anything on Mehrnia Outside and here I want all the legal things Their contacts Their limitations, who they've dealt with Don't miss anything He said no at first, then he kind of caved He's sent Nabavi to China I know, he left a message asking for you -I blocked him, do you need him? -So what at the end? -He said he has to investigate -Investigate what? Me, well the case You didn't do anything when I told you, what do I do now? Hold on Come outside, I'm here Where are you? I'm at the vice president's mother's funeral It's better if they see me here -Will you come to the office later? -No I'm busy Sicko The mosque hasn't been finished all this time? -The builder fell and broke his leg -Poor thing Poor builder I heard you spent haji Dashti's money elsewhere -No I swear, who said that? -Fine The money I'm giving away I'd like it to be spent for a good cause God says I like the sort of lie that makes people come together I don't like the truth that drives people away from one another Don't fall for people's prayers Sometimes people get into the habit of praying they're too afraid of stopping Give them this money... To fight their fears, here What if the tiny crystals would sit on his small brain and erased his memory? To the point where he wouldn't even remember his own name Then he wouldn't spend me on everyone -It's Nami -What's he saying? -He says I'm in 5% -It's a game I already said 1% But if he insists, says I've talked to the doctor, he's willing to agree on 1.5% But not like I said... -In your own way -I won't do it You won't? I've talked to all of them, they want their money I'll make you We can't use a lawyer, I got 2% Don't give him 2%. 1.5% tops The 0.5% is for us -What if he doesn't agree? -He will Bring him here I'm not the 17-year-old teenager you can boss around Why do you talk shit? Who got you out of the house? I did -You've forgotten how I paid you out? -Lower your voice You leave this place You deserve to live on the streets. I'll ask for the car to be collected Act for others not me You can't get away with what I have from you I'll hand you over to those who want you dead This horrible soul separated you and I I wish you were the reality my sister I had dreamt all of these years I wish we'd stick together with the safety pins at grade 7 So I wouldn't leave you behind If we had a family, none of this would have happened to us God Wasn't Nabavi supposed to be the last one? I asked you in this room on that spot I know you didn't notice me Now I have to hide my tiredness behind my eyelids... Wear my 24-hour red lipstick So this man would notice me and rescue me You didn't mention you owned a gallery You're so busy What are all these safety pins on the table? If Ann wouldn't invent it I would The inventor When she was playing with a 20 cm wire... She twisted the head... Just like life -Interesting -She made it -Yes -Something like a pin... That stuck to everything But doesn't cause any harm... Connects things and people That's why I love it I see Look at the lock -It's here -What do you see? Nothing it's a lock -It's a woman -Really? -Yes -No This is the hair and I got it It's looking at something far away It's me, don't ask what or who I'm looking at I'll pin one to you What? What did the doctor say? Doctor is real stubborn He's not the only one calling the shots He said 1% Doesn't matter what he says -What do you say? -Me? Yes, don't you have your share? I used my share to have asked for you I'm willing to ask for 3% and the rest is yours There's not much else, 3% isn't possible But I might be able to get 1.5% for you Is that any good? I'd still agree if you said nothing You tell me... He talks so calmly it scares me Months before I meet him I longed for a mild Alzheimer's Maybe beyond mild I wanted it and it happened Now that I look at him, I've never seen his smile on anyone else What do I say? I can't think of anything They have worked elsewhere This isn't our sort of work Mohey it's too complicated It's just him who can get hold of the money in France Then you marry him -I would if he'd take me -You started it, I said we don't do this You said the country is a mess we can Calm down, come here -I'm not in -Come here I said What did you say? I can't, I'll pay back what I owe but I can't do this Fine, I have paperwork against you The money you owe me and the company To you? How many times do you count it? You didn't see it Forget this Mohey Didn't you want to use this money to find your sister? Didn't you say they've found her in Canda? What happened? It's fine -Once I tell him, he'll let me go -You won't If you do, you'll lose him, me, the company and the money They'll kill us You don't get what I'm saying -Are you plain stupid? -Do you understand what you're saying? -What if he didn't divorce me? -You said he'd be engaged -What difference does it make? -Everything has its own rules -Say you want a divorce on a specific date -What if he didn't do it? Ask for something that you could use I don't know, cheque, paperwork house, a car -You know how to get things -I don't want those things It'll cost a good lawyer I'll help you get a divorce I'll pay for it myself What are you taking revenge for? I have to take revenge on you It's better if you don't mix up with him, I can't help It's a bad country to be stuck in Turkey is better, we had Reza there But France... We have to bribe him all the way It's not Iran It takes one year's worth of time and energy -You put in the time, I have the energy -What you're asking me This job is a break for us Yes but if it gets out, it'll contaminate everything -It's trouble -I'm asking you to do this -She's an insider -It's irrelevant Who is she to have done this to you? Look, you own 3% of my share If it goes well, I'll hand over 50% of my share on top And the money for the transport -5% of the money in Euros -Too much -Your problem -Make it 3% You handle the outside inside I'll take over 70/30 For something I don't want to do It costs a lot, I have to bribe everyone Deal The company that shopped in France... People gathered outside it I know you paid 2000 before to import products Everyone will find out soon Get yourself out of this deal Mohey I know you've shares They won't pay you a penny I wouldn't tell you if I didn't love you Look Mohey, I'm at the Pecan airport I'll be in Tehran in ten hours. I want to see you Your stuff -Can I take these? -Go on I think it's doctor What are you doing here? Weren't you supposed to leave? Are you blind? I said give me the address I came to get it myself so nothing went missing Of this? You make everyone look like me Not much left, get yourself together No one cared for me Other than my mother Everyone loved my dad Since we always held parties Some of the money he'd earn he'd share between his people My mum used to say My grandfather's dad had seen a jin He made her his, by pinning himself to her dress Then she became his wife They had kids together too She said if your dad is different It's because his grandmother's mum used to be a jin Careful son If you sin, they'll take you away 15,000 people have used implants from the PIP company The doctor who's representing the clients says We begin with 300 female prosecutors To file a complaint against the nipple implants used So they can receive compensation The implants from France have leaked and or ripped internally 300,000 have used implants from PIP in their plastic surgery Nabavi is lost? You want me to ask? He's on the other line I'll see you tonight Yes No -I just got up -Did you have fun last night? Yes? Seriously You enjoyed yourself? Okay We'll talk tonight Bye, see you Why have you sat there? -What should I do? -With what? -What's the end of this? -I married you No -Were we supposed to? -I haven't forgotten how I was the victim at 15 Otherwise you'd murder the rest of the family -Was I wrong to have helped? -You did wrong by me What did I ever want from you? -Other than being a man -Do you have anything else other than some paper with me? That's fake too I think it's not serious, I've paid for it too -You forgot -Enough You wanted to fill in for my mother -You can't -You brought me here I paid for you, you only work here Stay if you can otherwise 1 billion 650 1.7 It's a unique one, 1.8 1.8 billion -7 was always my lucky number -Lucky you -Thanks for buying me the painting -It's only small How much does Dr gain from selling these paintings? -What difference does it make for us? -Just asking From euro to toman, the paperwork is done I'm your wife, so I'm on your side I want you to defend me will you? -Of course -Promise? I promise I will, come Don't say anything I'll settle on 3% half half That's nothing Mohey We'll share, deal? Deal The table next to us was a teenage girl's 17th birthday She was real happy I pray for her not to have a cursed 17th year like me -Farzin bought me the painting -Congrats! I spoke to the shareholders, even if I agree they won't They say we'll hire a lawyer, it'll cost 500,000 Euros tops -Suit yourself, it's your money -Really When I spoke to Nabavi euro was 3,200 not 4,200 I killed time, we're desperate now you say "suit yourself" I have to pay for the difference now You talk as if Nabavi is changing the currency It's the politics If you kill more time, it'll go even higher Then you have to import from China The country isn't next door for us to be able to deal easily It's on the other side, France I didn't know there are shareholders She said the money is ours it's the company's -There are no dealers it's clean -Isn't it? I didn't know this is people's investments I got told it belonged to the company That's why I lowered Nabavi's 7% to 5% We paid an upfront I think it's not right for us to pay the fines -In this situation -What's that mean So I pay I've paid a lot so far for my contacts We all have to pay a price for the things we want If the fight is over me, end it I think 3% is fair for both sides -Whose side are you on? -She's my mentor I want her to be my wife, only Mr Nami, I can ask for 2% Go tell whoever it is you work with I thought I knew him so well He's trying to punish himself A little more, enough! A little to the left now keep it there Perfect -You like it? -Yes, I love you What? Is this you?

I'm not well -Put it out -You've started something I've to end it -Right go on I've never been lucky in my life You might ask why it all goes back to damn genes Who your parents are, where you're born. What religion you follow How much money you inherit and it's always inheritance You've no control over it right now a kid starved to death in Africa Nobody cares, a baby is born at the same time in a royal family Everyone has respect for it You know why?

He's the one getting a divorce He might've said it to trick you What if What if Nabavi has backed down The bastard wants me for a baby I don't want to take part in this game anymore It's not a game, it's serious. It's 700 million Euros With our signatures, they won't let go You started it otherwise I'd never be involved in money laundering We did everything we could this is our only way No one else other than him can get hold of them One person can release the products The ones above Nami, try to get hold of their details I don't want me and my baby to pay for his mother's ugliness Your mess I did?
