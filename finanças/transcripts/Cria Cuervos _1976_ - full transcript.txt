CONCEIVED, WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY I love you, I love you. Anselmo, you're tickling me. Be patient, Anselmo. I love you more than anything in the whole world. I love you. Like that, darling. Anselmo... what's wrong? Anselmo. I can't breathe. I'm suffocating. My God! Papa. Just what are you doing here? I can't sleep. You can't sleep. Do you know what time it is? It's very, very late. Off to bed now! Good night. Roni, look what I brought you. You're a real glutton. Rosa, when will I take my First Communion? I don't know. You have a few more years to go. Your turn, Ana. Come on. Let me do it, Rosa. What would happen if I bit your neck like this? And what if I kissed your neck? And what if I bit you again on this side? And what if I gave you a big loud kiss on the ear? Ana... just what are you thinking about? Rosa, is it true that my mother always wore this cross? Of course. Grandmother gave it to her. This cross keeps the devil away. And vampires too. Ready? They're ready, miss. Let's have a look. At least they're presentable. Thank you, Rosa. I hope you'll behave yourselves. Irene, come here. When you enter the room, first kiss your father. Then say a prayer for his soul. Understand? You understand, Ana? Let's go. Maite. When will I take my First Communion? Quiet, Maite. I came downstairs and heard Papa gasping. When I went in the room, I saw Papa was dead. Then Mama appeared. Mama's dead, Ana. Thank you very much. Irene, you're the oldest. You go first. Your turn, Ana. Go on. I don't want to. You and I will talk later. Your turn, Maite. Go with her. I can't reach. One day when my mother was cleaning the house, she took a metal can out of the closet. She gave it to me and said, "Ana, throw this in the rubbish bin. "It mustn't be here. "Besides, it's of no use anymore." I was curious and asked her, "What's inside?" "What do you care?" was her reply. "Is it poison?" I asked. My mother smiled and said, "Yes. "It's a horrible poison. "Just a spoonful of this powder can kill an elephant." Then she said, "Come on now. Throw it out." I was shocked. I don't know exactly why, but I didn't listen to my mother and kept the can. Why did I want to kill my father? I've asked myself that question hundreds of times... and all the answers I can think of now, with twenty years' hindsight... are too simple. They don't convince me. The only thing I remember very clearly is that at the time I was convinced my father was responsible for all the sadness that embittered the last years of my mother's life. I was convinced that it was he and he alone had caused her illness and death. My mother. According to those who knew her well, my mother could have been an excellent pianist. Ever since she was a child, she showed a particular gift for music, and everyone foretold a brilliant future for her. For many years she devoted herself almost exclusively to the piano and even gave public concerts. It was at one of these that she met my father. They fell in love and married shortly afterwards, and my mother gave up the piano for good to devote herself entirely to us, her daughters. I think she always missed those times and regretted giving up a profession that could have brought her freedom. But now I also think that deep down she feared she might not be the prodigy her friends had foretold. She preferred a quiet and well-ordered life to risking a responsibility she would have to face alone. Irene, didn't anybody ever teach you to eat properly? It's better to hold the fork like this. That's it. It's easier too. Ana, please, the knife! I can't believe you have no table manners. Maite, eat with your mouth closed. Nobody taught me. Don't be silly. Your parents never taught you how to behave at the table? Nobody taught me. I always eat this way. - What did you say? - Nothing. If you have something to say, speak up. Otherwise, be quiet. I don't like mumbling. Irene, your fork. Papa never told us how to eat. And what about your mother? My sister never taught you to eat properly? My mother died before I was born. Who told you such nonsense? I want you girls to listen carefully. Per your father's will, I've taken charge of your upbringing. From now on, you're under my care and protection. Your grandmother and I will be living here now, and we'll both do our best to provide everything you need. It may be hard in the beginning, but I'm sure that if we all try, we'll get along well. Right, Maite? There's one final thing: This house is a shambles. From now on, I want things tidy, and that means the three of you will have to pitch in and help. I want the house in order before your holiday is over. Can I count on you? - May I be excused? - Of course. - May I be excused? - Of course you may. I can see we're all going to get along well. Men are all the same, every one of them. You'll realise that when you're a woman. They all want the same thing. Heaven help you if you give in. Your father was awful that way. He chased women like mad. I had to run away from him more than once. I tell you, he had wandering hands. What stories I could tell about your father. That's it. The woman who lived next door to me - I still laugh when I think about it. One day she suddenly realised she was three months pregnant. You should have heard the commotion. Everyone kept asking who the father was, but she swore she hadn't slept with anybody. You understand what I'm talking about? - I don't understand anything. Here. Hold that. That's it. She said that one day she was walking past a building site when something fell inside her blouse. You know what it was? A mouse. She said that that mouse was the father of her child. Have you got anything for Roni? How can you keep such a disgusting animal? - Give me some lettuce. - In the fridge. But go easy. Your aunt laid into me the other day. What does it mean? One by one I remove the pearls from the string. Yes, one day she'll remove the pearls from the string. Her pearls and mine... our hours of bliss. - What floor is it on? - The third. There's nobody there. They went on holiday. Did you send him the letter? - Yes, but he didn't answer. - Because he doesn't love you. - What do you know? - You're silly. - You're the silly one. Look how chubby Roni is. Hey, cutie. - Maite, sweetie. - What? Help me look. Is this one good? You know who's downstairs? That good-looking friend of Papa's. What about this one? Yes. Mark it for me. Today the sun shines at my window And my heart grows sad looking out over the city Because you're leaving like every other night I awoke Thinking of you As my watch marked the passing hours Because you're leaving All my hopes of go with you Could you turn that music down? I'm going now. Be good. Where are you going? I have tons of things to do. But I'll be back before Rosa. Take care of your grandmother. Especially you, Irene. - Can we go with you? - Not this time. I'm in a rush. You're the oldest and the most sensible. Keep an eye on things. If anybody calls, I'll be back in a few hours. All right? Be good. Want to dance? I think Grandma's calling. What a pain! I'll go. Poor Grandma. Nobody pays attention to you. They leave you here alone, and you get tired of looking at the garden. Come on. Do you want to look at the pictures? Or would you rather have the prayer book? You want to look at the pictures. Anything else? I'll put on the music. You coming with us? Where? To look around. Come on. Don't be a drag. I'm not a drag. You are. - Can I go with you? - Yes. All right. How do I look? Ana, help me. - It's too big for you. - I don't care. - I'll never wear one of these. - Then you won't be able to run. - Why not? - Just because. Give me the broom. How are you, sweetheart? You're very late. You mind telling me what kept you out until 11:00 at night? Please don't start again. I'm dead tired. I've had quite a day. I'll bet! Don't give me that line. You think I'm stupid? Let's not start. I come home looking for peace and quiet, and I get this. You're making my life hell. My God, what have I done? You don't fool me with that innocent look. You think I'm stupid or what? I know very well who you were with. You were with... Rosa. Rosa? That's right. Now be quiet. Don't be silly. You and your stupid jealousy. You're the only one I love, Amelia, though sometimes you test my patience. This can't go on. I'll show you. Amelia, please! The children! They're asleep. Besides, I don't care if they wake up. They'll see what their father really is - a scoundrel. Shut up! It's not their fault. I'll shout all I want. Who do you think you are anyway? Oh, no! What are you girls doing? - Nothing. - We were playing. I'm playing the maid. Ana, come here. What have you got behind your back? Give it to me. My wig. And you used my rouge! You too, Irene? Go in the bathroom and wash your faces. Hurry now. And don't let this happen again. So you played the maid, did you, little mouse? Arms up. We're going to spend next weekend in the country. What do you say? Fine, but where? Nicolás Garate's villa. You know who that is, don't you? The man in the garden the other day. Amelia's husband. Take your pants off. Have you ever been there? We went once with Mama and Papa. There were horses... a pine grove, and I think a river too. That's right. It's a splendid estate. We'll have a great time. You'll see. Take this off too. Now your other leg. Now into the tub! Ouch! It's hot! We'll cool it down. Get in, Maite. Don't be naughty. Get down in the water. Crouch down, Maite. Now your head. Maite, sweetie. Nicolás was your father's best friend. A very good man. They were in the army and stationed in Burgos together. Amelia was with Papa when he died. What did you say? Amelia was in bed with Papa when he died. Wait a minute now. Tell me that story. Amelia was with your father? Are you being serious? Who told you that? Ana saw them together in bed. Now I get it. What did you see? I didn't see anything. Of course you didn't! You can't go around telling lies like that. Some lies can do a lot of harm. You're still too young to realise how serious certain things are. Where did you ever get such an idea? One day Papa told Mama that Amelia was very pretty. Mama said she wasn't that pretty. I think Amelia's very pretty, isn't she? Yes, she's very pretty. I can't understand people who say that childhood is the happiest time of one's life. It certainly wasn't for me. Maybe that's why I don't believe in a childlike paradise or that children are innocent or good by nature. I remember my childhood as an interminably long and sad time filled with fear. Fear of the unknown. There are things I can't forget. It's unbelievable how powerful memories can be. So very powerful. My mother was iII in bed. At the time I didn't know that her illness was incurable and that she'd been sent home from the hospital so she could die at home. My two sisters were with Aunt Paulina and Grandmother, who weren't yet living with us then. My father was out. I don't know where. Rosa acted as nurse. I want to speak to the doctor. It's very urgent. Tell him Rosa's calling. Doctor? Yes, Doctor, this is Rosa. She's very sick. Please come as soon as you can. She's in a lot of pain. I don't know what to do. Yes, she had a shot at 9:00. It's all a lie. There's nothing. Nothing. They lied to me. I'm afraid. I don't want to die. I'm afraid. I don't want to die! It hurts! Calm down. They're going to give you a shot. It'll stop the pain. Please. Listen. What are you doing here? Get out of here. Go and play. What are you doing here? I can't sleep. You can't sleep. Have you tried counting sheep? I see. May I stay with you a while? Do you know what time it is? It's very late. I don't feel sleepy. Why don't you play that song I like so much? This is no time to be playing the piano. Please, Mama. All right. But then you promise to go to sleep? You sure? You promise? I promise. The song you like. This is the one, right? What do you mean, no? I don't know. Blow. Here. Is this the one? What about that promise? Off to bed now. Give me a kiss. Another one. Kiss me like in the movies. Now like the Eskimos. And now kiss me - like a bear. Listen, she-bear, to bed. Come on. That's enough bears now. So you're still up. I told you I'd be home late. Go to bed. - I can't sleep. Anselmo, I've been waiting for you. I wanted to talk to you. We'll talk tomorrow. I'm tired. I'm going to bed. Let's go to bed. We have all day tomorrow to chat. I don't want to chat all day tomorrow. I want to talk to you now. About what? I don't know. Tell me what you did tonight. Did you have a good time? Yes, I had a good time. You had a good time. I can't go on, Anselmo. I've reached my limit. I can't go on. Stop talking nonsense, María. Let's not start this again. You need to find a pastime. - I don't want a pastime! You can't be locked up in here all day brooding. I want to die. Come on, María. Take it easy. I'm sick. Calm down. There's nothing wrong with you. Absolutely nothing. Help me. Help me! I'm sick! How can I help you if I don't know what you've got? Tell me about yourself. Don't leave me alone here all day. Love me! I'm sick! Here we go again with your infernal illness. You're not sick. - I'm sick! I've told you before I won't stand for blackmail. You're determined to make my life miserable. I'll tell you something. I'm fed up with your complaints and accusations. I am the way I am, so just leave me alone! Ana, what are you doing? Where were you? Let's hear it. Where were you? I went to get a drink of water. Did you have to go to the kitchen for that? I was thirsty. Off to bed now. Good night. Good night, Aunt Paulina. Sleep well. I'll leave the hallway light on. Call me if you need anything. Sleep well, Ana. Naughty girl. Always kicking off the covers. Good night, Mama. - Are you still awake? - I can't sleep. You can't sleep? Have you tried counting sheep? I see. May I stay with you a while? Shall I tell you a story? Yes. "Little Almond." "Little Almond"? Let's see if I remember. Once upon a time in a faraway land... there was a teeny tiny little girl. She was so tiny that she looked like an almond... so people used to call her Little Almond. One day Little Almond was asleep in her bed when she woke up. Her bed was tiny too. Mama. What's the matter? What's wrong, Ana? Irene, get back in bed. Ana, what's wrong? Calm down now. It was nothing. Were you dreaming? What's the matter? I want to die. Ana, don't be silly. You were dreaming. You had a nightmare, didn't you? I know. I'll tell you a story. Shall I? Let's see now. What story shall I tell you? I know. "Little Almond." Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a girl - I wish you were dead. How can you say that? I wish you were dead! You're a bad girl. You never do what you should. And you make Aunt Paulina and Rosa and my sisters suffer. You're a bad girl. You never do what you should. You don't mind, and you're a little thief. You took your friend Sofía's pen once and never gave it back. Not all my memories of that period are sad. Among my fondest memories, few can compare with that weekend. I can't really think why that particular trip remained so vividly engraved in my mind. I don't know, but I felt free, new, different. I remember I was wearing jeans with flowers on the pockets, a flowery blouse with red buttons, and a navy blue cardigan. Aunt Paulina drove. Irene got to sit in front because she was the oldest. Maite and I sat in the back. How was the trip? Hello there, beautiful. Don't be afraid of the dog. How are things? Hi, beautiful. Are you afraid of the dog, Maite? Figaro! The estate owned by Nicolás and Amelia was magnificent. A haven of peace that seemed part of some other world. But it was getting hard to keep up property like that, and a few years later, they sold it and moved to Madrid. Amelia, you have a great cook. That was a wonderful lunch. - Yes, she's tremendous. - Don't you ever cook? Heavens, no! I'm a terrible cook. Now I understand my father's fascination with that woman. Amelia was a very warm woman, affectionate and sensual. Her face lit up when she smiled. Her skin was a rich olive colour that you wanted to touch. Irene, why don't you girls play outside? I don't feel like it. I'm reading. You like that book? It's yours, but on one condition. What condition? That you all go outside and play. Enjoy the fresh air that you don't get in Madrid. Go on now. What do you say? Thank you. Come on, Ana and Maite. Don't cheat. And no looking. Ready or not, here I come. I saw you, you cheat! Come out! Which tree? That one. Come out, Maite, and stop cheating. Now you have to die. Come on, die! I saw you, Irene. You're behind the bushes. Come out! Now die! Ah, I'm dying! Guardian angel, my sweet companion, do not leave me alone or I will be Inst. Bring my sisters Irene and Maite back to life. Come on, Maite. You could live out here. No, it'd be a pain getting to work every day in Madrid. Why don't you go play with your sisters? I want to be with you. Did you have a fight? Yesterday it only took me 35 minutes. Go and play with your sisters. Have you noticed how tall Ana's become? I can't believe how time flies. Yes, it's been eight years since we met in Burgos. Remember? How long were you stationed in Burgos? Just long enough to study at the Cavalry Academy. Go and look for Papa and tell him we have to be in Madrid by 9:00. You're all wet! You're always peeing your pants. And don't give me that look. I won't stand for it. It's not time yet. Yes, I know what you want, but you'll just have to wait. Impatient - that's what you are. Go ahead. You bit me! Naughty girl! Glutton. Rosa, do babies have hair when they're born? You know by the heartburn. With Jacinto I had the most horrible pains. If the mother has heartburn, the baby will have lots of hair. How many did you have? Four. The last one died. I know the one in Germany. There's him, and María who lives in Barcelona, and Jacinto. Remember Jacinto, when we went to the country with your mother? No, I don't. Let me show you. You hold it like this, see? You see? I remember when you were born. Your father was so upset. God punished him with three daughters. They had to use forceps to get you out. What's that? You wouldn't come out. They had to pull you out. The doctor, the anaesthetist and the midwife. They just couldn't get you out of your mother's womb. How about that? If you look closely in the mirror, you'll still see some marks here. Here? Your poor mother wanted to breast-feed you, but she was too pale and delicate. So I was the one who really nursed you. - Did you breast-feed me? - Heavens, no. I gave you a bottle. You've got big breasts. Will you show me? What do think this is, a circus? Come on, show me. I'll close my eyes and count to five. They're so big! Go on and see what the old hag wants. This one? Then it must be this one. Do you want a closer look? Is that Mama? If it's not Mama, who else could it be? Your sister? Your mother? A friend? The postcard of the lake. You were in Switzerland with Grandfather... when you were young. And this hotel reminds you of the honeymoon. The lake at sunrise was beautiful, full of swans. You could see the mountains covered with snow. This was the window of your room. You want to die? Do you want me to help you die? I'll be right back. BAKING SODA Here it is - a horrible poison. Just a spoonful of this powder can kill an elephant. It's deadly poison. Don't you want it? Just a moment ago you said you did. Why not? Whatever you say. Roni. Are you sick? What's wrong? Poor little thing. Poor Roni. I'll take care of you. You'll be well in no time. He's dead. Take this holy card. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name... What happens when someone dies? Leave me alone. Come on. I've done you lots of favours. Nothing happens. The person just dies. Just dies? I don't understand. How do you die? Don't ask me! Ana, what are you up to? Nothing. Is your aunt home? I don't know. I think so. Go and wash your face or she'll have a fit. It was a mistake to marry her, Paulina. At the time I thought love could triumph over all, that everything would work out if we loved each other. I soon realised I was wrong. My marriage has been a complete failure. Everyone carries his burden as best he can. I won't just resign myself, act like nothing is wrong. I just won't do it. Sorry to bore you with my problems. Not at all. Just the opposite. Anyway, it doesn't matter much anymore. And what have you been doing? Me? What do you think I do? Nothing. I'm cooped up here all day until the girls go back to school. You should get out more often. You can't spend your whole life between these walls. A woman like yourself, still so young - Thanks, Rosa. What are the girls doing? We're tidying up their father's office. This house was a disaster. I've never seen such a mess. Anyway. If it wasn't for Rosa - Anything else? No. I mean yes. Don't touch the glass cases. I'll do that myself. - A little more tea? - Thank you. Out of the way, please. Rosa, when did the Spanish Civil War end? I think it was1939. - What did Papa do during the war? - I'm not sure. Oh, yes. Your mother told me he volunteered. Later he fought beside the Nazis in Russia. That's where he was wounded in the leg. Put that gun back where it was! It's mine. Put that back where it was! Papa gave it to me one day. Ask Irene. Isn't it mine? It's true. He gave me this rifle and Ana that gun. And he gave me the Legion flag. Enough nonsense! Put it back. Weapons are dangerous. Don't make me tell you again. "Once mine, always mine." Stop this foolishness. Go ask your aunt how she feels about it. Go ahead. Ask her. Let's see what she says. How could I forget? It was in Burgos, the summer of1965. You were stationed at headquarters. See? You still love me. You've always loved me, Paulina, and I love you. I've always been in love with you, my darling. - Ana, why didn't you knock? - The door was open. What do you want? Rosa says this gun isn't mine. What are you doing with that? Put it down this instant! Calm down. I'll take care of this. Ana, why do you want a gun? Guns are for boys. Papa gave it to me. It's mine. Ask Irene. Of course he did. Let's have a look here. It's very beautiful. It's a Luger, a Parabellum .38 calibre. May I see it? Come on. Just for a second. Good girl. Don't worry. I'm sure it's not loaded. Look, you just pull the bolt - I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! Paulina, I love you. Today the sun shines at my window And my heart grows sad looking out over the city Because you're leaving like every other night I awoke Thinking of you As my watch marked the passing hours Because you're leaving All my hopes of go with you You'll forget me Outside the station I'll cry like a baby Because you're leaving Could you turn that music down? I hope she dies. Thanks, Ana. You're a darling. You're welcome, Auntie. Ouch! I pricked my finger! You're as clumsy as your mother. Hold the needle properly. Come here. Let me do it. Hold it like this, see? Understand? Now you do it. You're more like your mother every day. In what way? Sometimes your gestures are just like hers. When you talk, it's like I'm hearing her voice. The poor thing suffered so much. - Because she was sick? Not just that. One day I'll tell you a few things. Your mother deserved a lot better. She was a saint, a real saint. She confided in me, even the most intimate matters, and some of it was really shocking. I remember one day your father had to leave suddenly. I think for Segovia. Your mother waited up all night - - What are you saying? Nothing, miss. I don't like you gossiping about my sister. She's dead. Let's let her rest in peace. Don't go on about her in front of the girls. You should know that. Ana, come here. I'd like to know something: You remember your mother well, don't you? Yes, sometimes. I don't want you to think I'm usurping - What does "usurping" mean? I just want to see that you're all happy and want for nothing. But I can't give you girls affection if you're not willing to receive it. This isn't easy for me. Not easy at all. Rosa, go look for Maite. Tell her to come try her dress on. If you want me to leave, just say so. I do! I want to be alone with Ana. This only concerns her and me. This is too much! Who does that fool think she is! May I go? No!You stay here until I say you can go. All right. Do as you please. Poor thing. Come on, girls, get up. It's 7:00. Time for school. Irene, stop pretending you're asleep. Come on. - Leave me alone. - What's this? I don't want to go to school. - Me neither. - What's that? You think holidays last forever? Come on. Don't tickle me. What a racket! What are these children doing? Good morning, Auntie. - Did you sleep well? - Yes, and you? Wonderfully. Good morning, Rosa. Come here, Maite. - Did you sleep well, Ana? - So-so. Here's your shirt. Just so-so? Why? Did you have a nightmare? We went down one street after another. Suddenly we were in the countryside. In the distance was a house that looked run-down and abandoned. The car went up to it. Two men came out, and one of them said, "How was the hunt?" The man said, "Very good. Look what I brought you." They took me out of the car and into the house. There was a dirty kitchen with a very old pan and a few pots. Then they took me into one of the bedrooms and locked me in. Later they brought me some food. I wouldn't eat it, because I thought it had been cooked in that old pan. They asked me my telephone number, and I gave it to them, afraid that they would kill me. They phoned, but Mama and Papa weren't in. - Mama and Papa are dead. - Not in my dream. They were out looking for me. The man said they would call again in half an hour, but if they weren't in by then, they'd kill me. I was terrified. Half an hour later, they called again. They still weren't in. They hadn't got back yet. So they said, "The time has come to kill you." They tied me to a wooden column. They put a gun to my temple, and just as they were about to shoot, I woke up.
