The places and characters presented here exist only in my memories of the summer of 1915. There was this house, there was Suzanne, the Polish blonde in her widow's dress of black, there was Catherine, her sister-in-law, there was ... Madame, I bring news. Madame? I saw a soldier. No, Marie. I shall wear the black one again. - I ironed this one. I thought— - The black dress, Marie. Choose first. - No, you start, you're the eldest. You'll be the shepherdess. Wait! You also have to open that hand. So. Look carefully. - Well? Open it. - Abracadabra! Is the black witch there? - You cheated! - You can't do that, Jean-Charles. It's serious! - Yes, it's serious. - I changed my mind. And it's me who decides. - Oh no! - Whose idea was it? - All right, it was you. - Whoever came up with the idea decides. - There's no sense in that. You're not the only one. There's three of us in this. - It's me who decides. And if you disagree, come up with something else. - Do you agree with him? - No I don't! - So you're not playing with us any more? - You're on his side now! - No, but we can still see what he wants. And if we don't like it, well, we can stop. - Jean-Charles has won again! This isn't much of a game! - Good morning, Aunt Suzanne. - Morning, Mum. - Good morning, Aunt. - Good morning, Monsieur Nephew. That's my lady's perfume, not yours! Stop! I can't stand it any more. - Weakling. - We're stopping! Now! Stop! - If I were the King in his sedan chair— I'd have you whipped! - And we'd have your head cut off! - Hurry up, let's catch him! My dear husband husband, husband, husband This morning a soldier came to the property.

Do you think girls have two holes? - Why two holes? - A boy at school in Versailles told me that. He saw his sister. - Two holes or three holes? - Did you believe what he said? - He said he'd seen it. - One day, I saw Marie completely naked. - Where did you see her? - What did you see? I saw her in her room. - And? - I saw what a woman looks like. What did you expect? - Well, I don't know—a chest with big end bits? - We call them "nipples". I saw that in the dictionary. - And what else did the dictionary say? - I couldn't find anything else. - So tell us what you saw! - I saw hair. On her stomach. - Hair! That must be so ugly.

Would you care to do me a great favour? - Gladly, O joy of my heart. Please, say what it is you want from me. - I want a remedy for the grief that consumes me. From you, who are a magician. Surely you can give me something infallible. - Yes of course— Morbleu. I know wonderful secrets to bring happiness to those beautiful eyes. - But Monsieur Colas, I have no money. You must accept these earrings. I give them to you. They're pure gold. - My child, keep your earrings! - What? You spurn them? No! No, Monsieur Colas! All my kisses I keep for Bastien. Be kind to me. Must I die? - Die? So young? Take good care not to do so! The noble chatelaine knows best how to attract him. And, in order to seduce him, pays him a thousand compliments— in the form of many costly gifts. Can we really miss a lover, when we pay for our pleasures? He'll come back. I give you my word. But you'll need other ways to keep him under control. You have to be mischievous, light and playful. Without cheating. Without mockery. It's not easy to bring a lover back to constancy. It'll be difficult. - The moment I see him I lose my head and my tongue. - All this is worth nothing, my child. Even if your heart is yearning, you must appear fickle. To bring back an inconstant lover, you have to pretend to flee from him. That's what the ladies of the city do. ♪ The advice I give you. ♪ ♪ The advice I give you. ♪ ♪ My child, you must follow it. ♪ ♪ My child, you must follow it. ♪ ♪ Yes, I'll do my utmost. ♪ ♪ Yes Monsieur, night and day. ♪ ♪ Yes Monsieur, night and day. ♪ ♪ Will you be grateful? ♪ ♪ Will you be grateful? ♪ ♪ Yes sir, night and day. ♪ ♪ Yes sir, night and day. ♪ ♪ Night and day. ♪ ♪ Oh, such innocence. ♪ ♪ Oh, such innocence. ♪ ♪ Now let happiness— ♪ ♪ light up your countenance. ♪ ♪ Now let happiness light up your countenance. ♪ ♪ Yes Monsieur, if I can. ♪ ♪ Yes Monsieur, if I can. ♪ ♪ Show yourself of sweet disposition. ♪ ♪ - Yes sir, if I can. ♪ ♪ Show yourself of sweet disposition. ♪ ♪ - Yes sir, if I can. ♪ Thank you Monsieur Colas. - These two lovers are truly the result of a miracle. Only in the countryside can one find such innocence. In the city, they are wise from the cradle. And daughters often know more than mothers. Are you in pain? The heart is sound. Are you going to operate? - Obviously, obviously! You'll help me. We have to amputate! - You can't do that. Who will love her in that condition? - Then she will die. Better to love a one-legged woman than a dead one. - Do your duty. Are you going to operate with that? - We have to make the best of things! Suzanne. - Catherine? Why are you silent? Because you know, don't you? Because you know, don't you? You know, don't you? - Catherine, what is it? What is it? The house— The house! It's finished. They're sulking at the big table. What was it like before? - Before— One of the boys? - No, Madame Suzanne. It started when Monsieur and Madame, the parents, died ten years ago. The train crash— Killed twenty. Monsieur Paul wanted nothing to do with it. Yet he was the eldest in the family. He said a doctor, a scientist, shouldn't have to deal with money. However— Monsieur Georges began to make bad decisions at the factory, and had to sell some land. Catherine went to see her brother in Versailles. To get him to come back here to take care of the properties. Madame Suzanne and Monsieur Paul refused to come. And Monsieur Georges continued to lose money. He was never at home. He preferred to gamble in Paris. And the factory was sold. Catherine resented her brother for not doing anything. She thought Madame Suzanne had kept Monsieur Paul in Versailles. I'm sure she was wrong. Madame Suzanne would have followed her husband anywhere. I prefer to believe Catherine was jealous of Madame Suzanne. - Jealous of Madame Suzanne? It's time to go to sleep. I heard her talking to Aunt Suzanne. I heard her. She seemed to be very angry with Aunt Suzanne. - I don't understand it. - Maybe they had a disagreement. - What about? - There was nothing to agree or disagree with. It was just something Mum was explaining to Aunt Suzanne. She was screaming, screaming! - Who was screaming? - Mum was screaming. Then she ran off. And Aunt Suzanne followed her. - She never screams. Except at the maids. It means we're leaving. That's what it means. - Will you come to live with us? - Your house is too small. - Where will you go? - To another house. - You don't have any other houses. - Dad will find one. - Your father's at war. We have to find a house. I'm scared. Come on, get up in there! ♪ Grateful thanks I have to give you! Grateful thanks! ♪ ♪ Thank you so much Monsieur Colas. ♪ ♪ Monsieur Colas. ♪ ♪ Thank you so much!

That you're weary of these vain flatteries. And that for once, you heeded my advice. But you followed it very late. And the harvest time is over. - The harvest time is over? What do you mean? - She has left you. - Come, you're making fun of me! My Bastienne has too tender a heart to do such a thing to me. I'm sure she hasn't given herself to anyone! - If she hasn't given herself yet, then she knows how to do it. You should know your beloved has another suitor. He's courteous, he has good manners. He's rich and worthy of being loved. - How do you know all this? - Through my magic. - Your magic? - Assuredly! And you should have found it out long ago. - I'm so sad! My dear Monsieur Colas, don't you have a few secrets that would restore my Bastienne to me? - My poor child— You make me sad. Wait a minute.

You could have helped me! Don't you find it nicer like that? I didn't like the frame. - Poor Monsieur Georges. Are we going to wake up Mum? - What for? - Aren't you afraid? - Mum's scared too. Here! Come on! All right, come back now, children! You'll catch a cold. I don't have much confidence in this water. Which of you gentlemen is next? - Whoever gets there first! Eric! Your turn! Marie! Marie, come here. - Yes, Madame. Go back to the house. I don't want to see you again today. You understand? - Yes Madame. Catherine! I don't want your maid laying hands on my children. Is that understood? - But Mum, you saw it, it was me who— - Shut up Eric! Don't talk back to your mother! Stay where you are.

You think I've changed. Only you're wrong. A certain leprechaun cast a spell on me. But the good Colas drove it away. - All your sorry excuses! If you were enchanted, I was bewitched! And over me all Colas' art is powerless. - Marry me. Marriage dispels all witchcraft. Believe me, the best medicine is still a husband! - Oh such good advice! Marriage has already caused enough grief! And on top of that, would I still have an unfaithful husband? The pain and sorrow would be unbearable! Ah, what a fine remedy! - Are you being stubborn? Well, do what you like! - I'll go to the city to find my love! Go on then! I am not frightened by your threats! I shall hurry back to my chatelaine! Madame wishes to take all the cutlery? - She'll take only those that are silver. They say there are looters. I'm suffocating! I feel like I'm suffocating. - There's a storm coming. - It's in the air. It smells of death. My dear wife, I'm writing to you from the capital city. Again, the business requires me— to stay longer than I would have expected. Hey, come and look! - Don't pull like that, you'll tear my dress. - You see? It looks like a girl. Just like a girl! How are you my dear? And yourself, my dear? - Some trouble with my maid. - You are such idiots. - I caught her skimming off the accounts a bit. - You sent her away I hope? - No! On the contrary, I kept her. Now at least I know she's stealing from me. With someone else, I would still have to discover it. What a waste of time! - You've always been an original. And how is your husband? - He's been at the front for a fortnight. He's having a fine war, and all of this is good for our future. He always says to me: "My dear—" "One year of war in the right place, advances us faster than ten years in a Ministry." But I'm confused. I forget that your husband was killed in the service of France. - That's what consoles me. I feel he did not die in vain. There was a big age difference anyway. - Life is not equal for everyone. - Fortunately, I still have this property in memory of him. - Hurry up, we have to go!
