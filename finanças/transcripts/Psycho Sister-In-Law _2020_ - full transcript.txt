You mean little laney. Ah, no. That's definitely a little boy. It is definitely a little girl, you know why, 'cause I'm always right. -Mm. No, no, not always. -Yes, I am.

Well, cheers to my son and daughter-in-law, and the soon-to-be epic upbringing of my first grandchild. Why is everybody here today, dad? You didn't say. Well, the baby, of course.

Honestly, I doubt anyone would miss you very much besides me. -Here, look. -Wait, hold on a sec. Callie. Hey. What's up? nick, what is it? Nick, talk to me. What's wrong? It's... My dad. Uh, I guess there was a construction accident at the new investment property. What? Callie said he, he's gone. What? Oh, nick, I'm so sorry. hello. Hi, hi, is this, uh, zara downes? this is zara. Um, who's this? hi, zara, I'm turner stevens. I am legal counsel and estate attorney for your father, gavin downes. Yeah? zara, I'm really sorry to be the one to tell you this, but, um, your father gavin, he, he died late yesterday evening at one of his construction sites. But, well, then you should know that I haven't seen or spoken to my dad since I was a little kid. I've been his attorney for about six years, so, yes, I'm, I'm aware there has been some time, yes. Uh, like, why, why are you telling me all this anyway? zara, your father did leave you something in the will. Uh, there will be a final will and testimony read this Wednesday at his estate here in the hills. Are you still at the address in encino? Uh, no, I, I actually moved to vegas, but, um, you know, I can make it there. Is there gonna be a service? Yes, there is a service, it's gonna be at the lake view cemetery this Saturday. Great. Um, could you just text me the time and address? I certainly will. And, and zara, I... I know that things were... Sticky between you and your father, and your mother and I just wanted to tell you that I do think he did what he felt was best. would you like me to call your mother and... no, uh, she died a few years ago. It's fine. I'm sorry to hear that. Uh, is there anything else? I kinda gotta go. uh, yeah, I think so. I will, uh, text you all the... now what have you been up to, nick downes? Oh. Looks like my big brother's having a baby. hey, nick, who's that? I think that's my sister. Zara. Hey, it's me, nick. Nick! Hi. I, um... I'm so sorry. How are you holding up? I'm fine. And this is my wife, haley. -Hi. -Haley, hi. -It's nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you, too. Oh, and you're expecting. Congratulations. thank you. Um, thank you for coming today. I, I have to admit, um, nick has mentioned you over the years, but I was starting to wonder if you actually existed. Yeah, I was sort of starting to wonder if this side of the family knew I existed, too. You should've come closer to the service. No, I didn't wanna make your mom uncomfortable. I thought it was probably better if I stayed back. No, my, uh, my parents got divorced about five years ago. Oh, gosh. I had no idea. And our father never remarried? He was engaged. Engaged. He was supposed to get married this, uh, this upcoming spring. Oh, that's awful. Oh, nick, I am so sorry for what you're going through. I know how close you guys were. Well, thank you. I think he, uh, he would've appreciated you coming. Yeah, I just wish I hadn't been late. Oh, well, we're actually having a little memorial back at the house if you wanna join us? Uh, yeah, I, I think I'd really like that. -Thank you. -Yeah. Yeah, come. So, uh, where are you living, zara? Oh, I live in las vegas now. I actually just finished up a production on a show there. Oh, so are you a dancer? No, no. Definitely not. I'm, I'm an actress. But theater's actually my first passion. Oh. So, how's the theater scene in vegas? Well, it's no broadway, but there's always new productions and roles being cast, so it's not too bad. But I have been missing la. Yeah? hey, guys, um, I wanted to introduce you to nick's sister, zara. Uh, zara, these are my best friends, roslyn and lydia. Hi there. You can call me roz. Haley, you never told us nick had a sister, did you? Oh, well, actually, I'm just his half-sister. We didn't grow up together. Well, it's nice to meet you, anyway. I definitely see the resemblance. -What do you do, zara? -She's an actress. Well, you're definitely in the right city for that. -I, I actually live in vegas. -Fun! I love that gritty little city. You know, I have been considering moving back to la. I was dating this guy but it ended, so there isn't really anything keeping me there anymore. Well, you should, how else is this... Little one's only aunt gonna get to know the little niece or nephew? Aw. Well, I certainly do agree with that, but you don't have any siblings? No. Sadly, I don't. And my parents are still back east, so I don't really have any family here in town. Aww. Well, maybe I will stick around a few more days, I mean, how else am I supposed to get to know my sweet, expecting sister-in-law? I think there's only way to actually find out. Yeah. I think it's a girl. - what's her name? - um, I think laney. -If it's a girl. -Yeah. - Landon, if it's a boy. - that's cute. yeah. yeah, nick really wants a boy, but we'll be happy no matter what. I am so sorry to be bringing this up today, it's, it's just... Your father's senior vp. It's they are all asking. Your father was such a presence, I think they're just a little bit nervous. No, it's fine, I completely get it. just, uh, massive shoes to fill, huh? Yeah. Your dad has overseen every step this company has ever made since your uncle passed. -He never missed a beat. -I know. And I know that you were wanting to stay in westlake and not raise kids, you know, in the middle of the town here, but... Yeah, someone needs to be here. I know. Uh, I'll talk to haley about it tonight. I think that we were gonna be staying with callie, anyway, so maybe we can stay a little longer. And why shouldn't you? I mean, this is your home. Well, actually, it was your dad's... Home. Well, mm. You know what, in fact, I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna move some of my things into the guest bedroom, and then that way, you and haley can have the master. No, callie, you don't need to do that. We're used to staying in the guest bedroom. No, no, no, I insist. Plus, you know that mattress is just way too soft for haley's back. So, you'll sleep in my bedroom for now, and then we'll figure out everything else later, okay? Okay. Hey, guys. Um, zara, this is turner, he worked for gavin, and callie, gavin's fiance, and also the godmother to our baby. Who shall go by auntie, not granny. zara, it's really nice to meet you I'm glad you could come. I... Oh, yes, that's right. -We spoke on the phone. -Yes. Look, I really wanted to apologize, I was having a rough day, and I didn't know who kept calling me, so... I'm sorry. No, don't worry about it. It's completely fine. Thank you. And, callie, I, I love your outfit. It's very... Postmortem glam. thank you. Um, I actually wore this to a black tie affair, uh, with gavin when I first met him. Sure didn't think I'd be wearing it again for his... his funeral. I'm... I'm sorry, will you excuse me? I'm gonna go check on her. I'll be right back. So callie said that we can use the master bedroom. Said she was, uh, she was worried about your back. Aw, well, that's really nice. I actually am getting kinda tired, it would be nice to not to go all the way home. And what about you? Where are you staying? Oh, I was just gonna get a hotel somewhere. Oh, no, that's silly, you should stay here with us. I mean, we have plenty of room. Oh, I, I don't wanna impose. It's not an imposition. You're family. She should stay here with us, right? -Well... -Well, thank you. Yes, I, I'd love to. -Of course. -Thank you. Zara? - Hi. - oh. -You scared me! -Oh, I'm sorry. I just went downstairs for some water. Oh. Well, I was just coming to see if you needed anything. No, I'm good, thanks. Okay. Well, goodnight. Goodnight. Oh, and goodnight to you, sweet little thing. hey. Are you doing okay? Yeah, I just wanna get some sleep. I have to be at the firm tomorrow. What? No. Turner said the execs are freakin' out. I mean, it's been a week, so I get it. I gotta show face. I actually think I can manage it. Well, if anyone can, I know you can. Come here. I just wanna cuddle with you and that baby. Hm. -Good morning. -Morning. Wow, what's all this? Well, I was making breakfast for nick, but he barely touched a thing before he left for work. So now I'm counting on you and that little baby to be hungry. Well, I was gonna go do some yoga, but we're always hungry. well, good. how are the eggs? this is all amazing. Where'd you learn to cook? In a diner outside vegas. It was actually my first job when I moved there. But I was a waitress, and I was dating this guy and he taught me how to cook when he was gone. Hm, so what happened to this man who was in your life? He was possessive. Crazy, actually. So I, I had to cut him out. Oh. Well, I hope you got out before he did any real damage. Oh, no, he did. Uh, I actually lost my best friend amelia because of him. -You mean like she's... -No. No, no, no. Nothing like that. I mean, she's fine. We're just... We're not friends anymore, unfortunately. Oh. That's too bad. I'm sorry. It's okay. -good morning. -Good morning. Oof. She looks terrible. Poor callie. Well, what is she gonna do now? Does she have, like, a job or anything? No. She pretty much stopped working when she and gavin got together. She used to be a big-time commercial fashion model, but now she pretty much just shops. Yeah, well, no wonder she's so upset. I mean, her entire shopping budget is blown now that my father's passed away. Yeah, but nick and I were talking last night and she really did seemed to love gavin, you know? Are you sure that she loved him and not just his portfolio? hm. Ah. can I help you with something? No, just checking my email. Oh. Well... I'm sorry, you can't use this computer. Mm. No one had the password except for gavin. Plus, I don't think I'm comfortable with you being in our study. I mean, we hardly even know you. Fine. I'll just use my phone then. What? You know, I'm just trying to understand why it is they chose you for the godmother. Hm. You hardly seem fit. gavin and I were both the child's godparents and I hardly think that that is any of your business. Oh, see, I think it actually is my business. Especially considering I'm a part of this family and technically, you're not. goodnight. oh, wow, that's amazing. Is that for the baby's room? Yeah. Yeah, I was thinking like, classic fairy tale theme for everything. Oh, that's great. You have such great ideas. Aw, thanks. Well, I actually used to do this for a little while before I got pregnant. -What did you do? -Oh, like set design. -Production design. -Really? Well, that's amazing! I had no idea you had a passion for the arts like me. Yeah, well, I don't know how much time I'll have for it now since I'm gonna be a full-time mommy. What about you? Do you want kids? I do. Oh, I did. I was actually pregnant once. But, um, it, it didn't work out. Oh. -Zara, I'm, I'm so sorry. -No, it's okay. It's probably for the best anyway. I'm not even sure I could even go through that again. Plus, you know, being an actress and all, it's really hard to get pregnant. And it takes a toll on your body with all those changes and... You have to take so much time off work. Honestly, it'd just be so much easier if I could just find someone to have a baby for me. yeah, uh... yeah, you know, I hear ya. Sometimes I wish somebody else could do this part for me, too. mm! Good morning, girls. I'm off to lunch with the ladies. Can I get you anything while I'm out? Uh, no, no, I'm all good. Thanks. Okay. Bye. Well, that's certainly is some outfit for a mourning, wanna-be widow, don't you think? I suppose she can't just stay up in that little room for forever, right? She did clean up fast though. Well, I guess people just handle things in their own way. Nick is clearly throwing himself into work. Aww. I am here for you. "I, gavin downes the 2nd, residing at 516 aspendale in the state of california declare this to be my will, and I revoke any and all wills and amendments previously made. To my daughter zara, I give the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, and to my fiance callie hayes, the sum of six hundred thousand dollars. And all my residences, subject to any mortgages and the rest of my residuary estate, I give to my son, nicholas. If he does not survive me, I give that property to my grandchildren who survive me, in equal shares, to be divided amongst them. I appoint my son nicholas as executor of this will. If he is unable or unwilling to act, or resigns, I appoint my attorney turner stevens as successor executor. If the co-executor also predeceases me or is unable or unwilling to act, my fiance callie hayes shall serve as executor. My executor shall have all the powers allowable to executor..." truth is, if your father had been around through spring, I, I do think callie would've inherited a lot more. His last amendment was right after she moved into the house. But... He did love her and you know that. Yeah, she, she made him really happy these last couple of years. So... What do you think I should do? I don't know. It's your call, nick. If you did decide to do or give her something, I think your father would have really appreciated that. I just, I don't know what I'm gonna do. I, I don't have a career anymore. I mean, you know, I had that business that styling business I was starting with my model friends, but when gavin proposed, I, I gave everything up. Callie, you still have lots of time left to do other things. I know that's not what you're ready to hear right now, but it's okay to take some time while you figure out what's next. I can't imagine what you're going through right now. Death and bankruptcy. That's what this feels like. Oh, come on, I mean, 600k is hardly bankruptcy, right? I mean, I guess if you need cash you could probably sell off some of those expensive shoes, purses, and dresses that I saw hanging in the master closet. I mean, models do get that stuff for free, right? You went through my closet? Well, I mean, it's not actually your closet anymore, is it? excuse you. Who do you think you are, huh? Waltzing in here, pretending to be a part of our family just because, what, my, my dead fiance cheated on his wife with your mother? Oh, I think I have a hell of a lot more blood invested in this family than you do. Okay, guys, can, can we please calm down? It's been a really long day, I don't think we need any more drama. yeah, no. You're, you're probably right. I, I shouldn't have said that. I know you've had a rough day. I'll go. callie, look, I know you're not happy to hear how things turned out. But turner said it would've been changed after the wedding. I know, I understand, I'm not upset that he left everything behind to you. He should. You're, you're his son. It's just... Yeah. This is my home, you know? I can't, I can't imagine having to leave it. Look, haley and I still need to discuss the house further. You know, whether we're gonna be staying here, or maybe giving to you. oh, my god. Nick, are you serious? Well, I mean, I said maybe. You know, we still have a lot to figure out. I need, I need to go through my dad's assets, and figure out what's what. Of course. I totally understand. But you even just considering it... -Thank you so much. -Okay. No, no, no. Don't, well... Don't thank me yet. You know, it hasn't been decided. Uh, I can't make any rash decisions, but, uh, what I do know is my father loved you very much. Thank you. And you're still the godmother to our baby. That means something. Yeah. so what do you think? Should we leave her the house? I don't know. Honestly, I mean, would we stay, regardless? Do we really wanna raise our baby around the pool and all the stairs? Feels a bit precarious, doesn't it? good morning. Oh, good morning. Aww, zara, you shouldn't have. Well, the baby needs its fuel, so eat up! So where were you this morning? Oh. Um, I actually had a meeting with a talent manager. You had a meeting with a manager? Wow, that's so fast! -Congrats! -Thank you. Yeah. I, I called my old acting coach from east side before my read yesterday. He called in a couple of favors and he managed to get a meeting set up first thing this morning. Crazy, right? So how did it go? He said he likes my look, but he said the same thing you did, I need a good headshot. Ah. Which our photographer will do for you. Oh, and he said I need to move here immediately. He wants to find me an agent and start sending me out on auditions. -So what did you say? -Well, I said of course! Provided that you guys don't mind having me stick around a little bit longer. Well, I think that'd be just fine. thank you. Hey, so, um, what ended up happening with callie last night after I left? Oh, um, she calmed down. But... I do understand why she got worked up. Right. Yeah, I-I shouldn't have provoked her. I'm sorry. I, I don't know, there's something about her. It just irks me. Frankly, I think she should be glad that she got anything from our father's will. Yeah, well, I agree, but she's never given us a reason to think her intentions are anything but good. Right, yeah, no, of course. I mean, you would know best. I mean, she is godmother to your baby after all. who knows, they probably went to eat. Now, callie and turner have known each other pretty much as long as callie's known dad. Turner feels bad for her. What's the big deal? Okay, yeah, but I mean, she was certainly dressed a lot nicer than someone who was just going out for a casual dinner. So callie always dresses, even when she goes to the dry cleaners, trust me. Okay, but I mean, does she always make out with your father's attorney as well? Wait. You, you saw them making out? Yeah. Um... Look, I didn't wanna have to tell you this, but I saw them last night out the window. Their hands were all over each other. Well, I wish I'd known about that before I opened my mouth about the house. Wait, what about the house? Um, well, nick mentioned that we were maybe considering leaving it to her. What? Nick, after she already got all that money... I didn't say for sure, I said maybe. Wait, no, I mean, of course, it's entirely your decision, but, nick, I mean, don't you think this is just a little bit strange? I mean, with the timing of all of this, she's just suddenly hooking up with the next executor in line for the estate after you? hey. What's up? What are they talking about out there? Um... Nick and I decided that we think it might be best if callie finds somewhere else to stay for a while. Oh, wow. You know, that's probably for the best. hello. Is turner in this morning? Yes, absolutely. Nick! What's up? What a nice surprise! Come on back. You know, I can't stay for long. I have to get to the office. -But, uh... -Sure. Look, I just wanted to say that... I know about you and callie. What about me and callie? Turner, look, I've known you since I was 15 years old. Yeah, so, why would you think there's something between me and callie? You had your hands all over each other in my driveway. Nick... What are you talking about? Did you or did you not take callie out last night? Yeah, we went to carpaccio's for dinner, and then we went and had drinks, and then I drove her home 'cause she was drunk. A-and you expect me to believe that that was just platonic? That's exactly what I expect you to believe. Do you think I'd do something like that to your father? You know how much respect I had for gavin. How much I thought you respected him. Nick, this may come as a surprise to you, but... I'm gay. -What? -Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. So... Whoa, so you and callie... Went and had drinks at the clownfish room. And then... Yeah, what can I say? She's adorable. Everyone loves her. And do you remember when I brought a really attractive french man to your father's barbecue like two years ago? turner, I... I am so sorry. I... I'm an idiot. No, it's fine, but... Who told you that we had our hands all over each other anyhow? I just don't understand how you would lie about something like this, zara. nick, I didn't lie. Look, I told you what I saw! And their hands were all over each other! Well, it must have been a very friendly hug because turner is not into women, apparently. Well, I'm sorry, all right? I guess I must have seen it wrong, but that doesn't change the fact that callie is a gold-digger. Zara, you can't go around accusing our baby's godmother of something so heinous without knowing for sure. wh... Where is she going? Honey, let's just calm down, okay? Zara thought that she saw something and you have to admit, it's a little odd that they were going out drinking together so soon after your dad passed away, right? Where is callie anyway? She went to stay at a hotel for a couple of nights. -Oh... -She just... She didn't feel that comfortable staying here after your talk this morning. I need to go apologize to her. Look, you guys, I am sorry that I overreacted last night, but it wasn't entirely unwarranted. oh. What is this? I needed to print something so I used the home computer and I found this in her bookmarks. -No, I don't believe this. -Yeah, I know. It's pretty crazy considering they weren't even married yet. But where did you even find this? Look, I-I didn't mean to pry, I-I just thought that you should know, and it's just after losing my own baby, I just feel really protective of my brother, and my new sister-in-law and my sweet little niece or nephew, and... Look, I'm just sorry, I thought you needed to know. -Haley! -In here! What's all that? I got a surprise for you. Okay, maybe I got lots of surprises, but you're gonna have to try them on, see which one fits. -What? No, you did not. -I did. Look, okay, I overheard you talking to nick about how he's taking you to some lame business dinner and that you had nothing to wear. Well, now you do. This is so sweet! Thank you. Of course. okay! Ready! You can come take a look. -Oh, it's perfect! -Really? Thanks. Oh, you know I'm actually kinda sad. These last few weeks here with you and nick have been so amazing. -I wish it never had to end. -Yeah. It's, it's been really nice having you around. I actually always kinda wanted a sister growing up, so, now I get to know what that feels like. Aww. Me, too. well, what if it didn't have to end? I mean, couldn't we all just stay here in this house? Together? You, nick, the baby, me? What, you, you mean like, all of us live here together permanently? Well, why not? I mean, we could just be like one big happy family. I mean, you could help me with my auditions and well, I could help around the house with the little baby. It just, it really doesn't have to end, does it? uh... Yeah. Maybe. I'll-I'll talk to nick about it. I love it! Yes! ♪ I'm so good ♪ ♪ good ♪ ♪ I'm so ♪ ♪ good ♪ ♪ I'm so good ♪ reid, what the hell are you doing here? You nearly scared me half to death! That was not funny. I came to see you, gorgeous. Shut up. Ow! You bit me. Yeah, and you're trespassing. Yeah? You never seemed to mind about me before I trespassed. Living a pretty lavish lifestyle these days, huh? it's my brother's house, all right? you're gonna offer me some of that? gracias. To a new life in the hills. you know, I, um, saw your sister-in-law. She's what, now about seven months pregnant? That must be a real treat for you. She's six months. What the hell are you doing here, reid? How'd you even find me, anyway? Estranged father gavin downes, recently deceased. Big financial firm. -It's in the papers, babe. -Yeah. It's not like I got anything anyway. why can't I want a little one-on-one time with the one who got away? -Oh, I hate you. -You love me. literally. oh, good morning. - morning. - Good morning. So, how was last night? Oh, it was amazing. - We had a really good time. - aww. That makes me so glad to hear. Mornin'! Guys, um, this is reid. He's my boyfriend, visiting from las vegas. Nice to meet you, uh, kayley, nick. -It's haley and nick. -Oh. Sorry. Haley. It's nice to meet you, too, reid. Uh, we're so glad that you could come for a visit. Yeah, what a nice surprise. Yeah, thanks for having me, and, uh, congratulations on that bun in the oven. Can you, uh, pass me the cream cheese, nick? Maybe somebody could pass him a-a shirt while we're at it? Yeah, reid, would you mind putting a shirt on? Now? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Hey, thank you so much again for the beautiful dress. It-it really was a big hit last night. Aww, good. That makes me so glad. You really should let me pay you something for it, though. Absolutely not! No, you guys, it was a gift. Please don't mention it. Zara, it was too nice. It was a expensive one, too. Guess you cashed in on that check dad left for you, huh? Mm. Could you pass me the bagels? so... Thought you said you didn't get anything in the will. You know, it really wasn't that much, all right? yeah, I'm guessing it was more than you or I've ever seen in our lifetime. you seem to forget how much I owe that loan shark for all the money I lost gambling trying to get us a better life, or did you? 'cause you'd never just leave me high and dry like that. Hm? So what? You think just 'cause you got me pregnant once that you own me? No, I don't want to own you, baby. I just want my half of what's ours. Glad we're on the same page. Hey, nick, can you come take a look at this? What do you think of this crib? Well, it's perfect for a baby boy. Or a little girl. Um... his smoke's coming in here. That's not good for the baby. Is that what I think it is? Son of a bitch. Dude, are you packing a pistol in the back of your jeans? Because I didn't realize concealed weapons were illegal in california? It's illegal in my house. And so is your smoking, man. Can you not see that my wife is six months pregnant? In what world do you think it's okay to bring your dirty fumes and firearm into our house? Nick, I am so sorry. He just showed up here last night with all of his things. I didn't tell him that haley was pregnant. Yeah, well, you shouldn't need to. -He can see with his own eyes. -Hey, hey, listen, man. I'm not trying to offend... I just didn't realize my girlfriend had come from such a classy family, I guess. That's fine. I can, uh, see I'm not welcome here, so, uh... I'll be leaving now. Enjoy the new tax bracket, babe. You guys, I am so sorry. I had no idea that he was coming here, I swear. I didn't even invite him, I didn't even know that he knew that I was here. I don't know how he found me. All right, look, I've been trying to get him out of my life for the last year and he just keeps finding me. Yeah, I thought you said you dumped him? I did. I did and he just won't take no for an answer. And I don't know how to make it any more clear to him. He says he loves me and I'm really afraid of him. I don't, I don't know what he's capable of and he scares me. Nick, I'm so sorry I never meant to put your baby in danger. It's okay. No, it's okay. you're safe here. you know, I still can't believe that she let that guy into our house. You know what? I-I'm gonna have turner look into him on Monday, see what he can find. We don't even know his last name. Oh, that's fine. I'll get it from zara. Honey, he's gone now. Don't you think that you're overreacting just a little bit? Actually, no, I don't think that I am. Haley, look, I think it's great that you and zara have been getting close since she got here, but I think it's time that she gets her own place. Hey, guys. Uh, I'm going to head out for drinks with my manager. But do you think I could borrow some of callie's perfume? -I just ran out. -Oh, yeah, sure. - Get whatever you need. - thanks. ooh, yummy. Goodnight! -Night! -Goodnight. hello? oh, morning. You slept in later than usual. Yeah. It was a super late night with my new manager. Really good for networking, though. Oh. Well, that's good to hear. Plus, I needed my beauty sleep, your guy manny is gonna come today to shoot my headshot. Oh, yeah? That's wonderful. Is everything all right? Of course. Yeah, I just wanted to see if you wanted a peanut butter and banana sandwich? Oh, um, I actually ate already, but thank you. Yeah. Sure. Anytime. zara, is that my phone? -Why are you on my phone? -No, I-I'm so sorry... look, it's been nice having you here, but you're really overstepping. Look, it's not what you think, all right? Honestly, I didn't mean anything by it, all right. I just... Why do you want roslyn's number? God, I'm, I'm so stupid. I was trying to plan a surprise baby shower for you here on Saturday, I had to get in touch with roslyn for the guest list. I already spoke to manny and he said he'd take photos of you, and I designed the invitations... -Oh, god, I am sorry. -Oh. No, I, I'm sorry. I was out of line. Obviously, you meant well. I just think that tensions are running a little high around here since your father passed. I know nick is still struggling. I can tell he's not sleeping very well. Okay, I get it, as a result, neither are you. God, you don't need this extra stress. We have to prioritize this baby. Hey, uh, why don't you let me help you get all pretty for your headshots? Really? Are-are you sure you wouldn't mind? Yeah, after everything you've done for me? Of course not. Thank you. hey, honey. the reason I stopped by is because it appears to me you are a few successors to gavin downes' estate? -That's right. -Okay. Um, did mr. Stevens ever discuss any late changes to your father's will with any of you? No, of course not. No, we, uh... We did a will reading a while ago. Why do you ask? Well, I'm just trying to figure out what might have possessed stevens to wanna make any changes to your father's will in his last few moments. - Why would he do that? - I don't know. That's why I'm asking. Look, detective, what does my father's estate have to do with turner's murder anyway? I'm confused. Have any of you seen this belt before? that's callie's belt. The one she was wearing at gavin's memorial. Callie hayes? You sure about that? Oh, wait, that's right, yes, I-I remember it now. I'm-I'm pretty sure I complimented her on it. So neither of you own a belt like this? I would never wear something like that. It's way too overpriced. Oh, you-you don't think callie could have something to do with the murder, do you? Well, I'm going to go see her for questioning after this. But if it's hers... Do any of you think callie could have been involved in this murder? No. I... I-I-I don't think so. It doesn't seem like callie at all. But then, everything seemed out of place lately. I mean, I haven't really known callie for very long, but honestly, I, I wouldn't put it past her. Look, I mean, she was really upset that our father died before they got married and she didn't inherit more of the estate as a result. Is all that true? Yeah, but... Murder? I-I don't think callie is capable of that, do you? Why did you bring up the will, anyway? Well, I think turner may have been manipulating the will in a way that would make callie the next coexecutor of the estate... After nick. I-I don't understand, why would turner do that? Gavin's not even around to make any changes to the will. w-what if turner didn't do it? Maybe he was coerced. No. Callie would know better. Would she? She and turner were close. Maybe she got under his skin after you guys asked her to move out. I mean, he's an attorney. Doesn't he have the power to manipulate things? That is, if it was mr. Stevens even trying to make those changes. Whatever the case, we believe a security guard doing his rounds spooked the murderer and whatever was being done was left unfinished. We're still investigating that, though. Well, I think that's everything for now. Okay, uh, well, please let us know if there's anything else we can do. Well, turner was a, was a very close family friend. I do have one more question, if you don't mind. Where were all of you Saturday evening around 11 o'clock? Just standard protocol to ask. Nick and I were here all night, together. And I was having drinks with my manager at a little mixer. Do you mind if I crosscheck that info with your manager? Of course. Here's his business card. You can call him anytime. I-I took a car home around 1:00. Okay, thank you. Evening, ladies. -are you all right? -Oh, yeah, yeah. No, things are just going to get crazier in the office. Looking forward to the weekend. Right. Um, speaking of... Zara wants to throw me a baby shower this weekend, but with everything that's happening, I-I feel like we should just cancel it. No. No, honey. No, we can't lose sight of what's still in front of us. And you need a proper baby shower. It just doesn't feel right. Haley, look, we're not gonna have a service for turner until his brother gets back into town. And this house could use a little good cheer, don't you think? And we could use some stuff for that baby's room. Hey, come here, come here. I actually think it's the first good idea zara's had. Hmm. Yeah. I guess this baby could use some happy endorphins from me right now. did you feel that? She just kicked. He just kicked. And I think he wants you to have that baby shower. Hmm... Okay. Okay, fine. We'll have the all girls' baby shower this weekend, but only if you promise that you'll come. Oh, please, please, nick. Promise me. Okay. Okay, I promise. So I was thinking that because we don't yet know the gender, maybe we could do some cupcakes with a pink frosting and some with blue, oh, and then we could do, like, a blue hawaiian punch and a strawberry pink lemonade. -Mm-hmm. -I think that sounds adorable. Ooh, and maybe we can make the blue one a little boozey. you would say that. oh! No, no, no! Here, let me get it. No, no, no, no! You guys are just crushing it with the shower planning, I don't want to stop you. -Haley. -Callie, hey. Um... Can we talk? Yeah. Sure. So how are you? well, considering I was questioned for the suspicion of murder last night, I'm, you know, okay. Look, we-we told the detective we don't believe you could ever do something like that. Thank you. But... Do you think that I did it? Do you? You actually think I killed turner? No. I really don't. Okay, good. Because I didn't. He was my friend. A good friend. And I'm devastated that he's gone, but... I'm not the victim in all of this. All I want now is to vindicate myself. And how exactly do you plan on doing that? I mean, all the evidence does point to you, doesn't it? And pray tell, zara, where were you during his murder, huh? Well, I was out to drink at a bar with my manager, along with multiple other witnesses. I've already been cleared, but where were you that night? I was in my hotel room at the beverly hills suites sleeping, not that it's any of your business. Oh, okay, so you were alone? all that matters is that you and nick believe that I am innocent. That is all that I care about. You know how much I loved gavin. You know that! And his money too. Shut the hell up, you stupid bitch. -Look, can we just... -haley, you need to take this. Nick was just in an accident at the construction site downtown. What? Wait, what did, what did they say? Is he all right? I don't know, but he's in the hospital. Nick! Honey, oh, my god, are you okay? Yeah, yeah, no, I just got a concussion, and a minor fracture in my arm. What happened? Well, I was on the site with the two vps of community development, and a pile of crates fell off and almost hit my head. Oh, my god. That's awful. Is everyone okay? No, yeah, everyone's fine. I was the only one under it, but it's crazy in that moment I just instinctively reeled back and tripped over a concrete cylinder and fell, hit my head. Well, thank god for your fall, then. I know it was just so surreal. In that moment, I felt like I was dad. I'm just... I'm glad you're okay, nick. Will you excuse me? Nick, I'm just so glad that you're all right, and what matters is that you're not dead, you're alive and you're here now. I know. I know. I'm fine, really. I told them to tell you guys not to come. Are you crazy? Of course we came. I was scared half to death when I heard. No, I knew you would be, the ct scan came back and everything's fine. It was probably just a bad concussion. Well, what about your fracture? Did they think that you're gonna need surgery? Yeah, a minor one on Friday. But as long as my head's okay still, I can get out of here by Sunday. No, but, nick, that means you're gonna miss the baby shower. Zara, we're gonna postpone the shower. Haley, we-we can do that, it's-it's not about you, it's for the baby. Yeah, but the baby will be fine until nick is home safe. Honey, please, don't, don't postpone the shower. What did we talk about? Happy baby. Nick is right, haley. Baby comes first. Uh, why was callie here with you guys? I was surprised to see her. Oh, well, she stopped by to check in on us. She was worried after everything with turner. Yeah, and with good reason, I mean, she's the only one of us who doesn't actually have an alibi. It's not safe to be around her. Zara, would you please give haley and I a moment alone? Is that okay? Um... Yeah. Yeah, no, of course, um, you guys should take your time. Uh, I'll just, I'll be outside. I'm really glad you're okay, nick. No, thank you. I'm okay. -I'll be outside. -Okay. Look, I'm nervous with you at the house alone. I don't trust anyone right now. Nick, it'll be fine. Zara's gonna be there. Yeah, that doesn't reassure me much. Look, I think her crazy ass ex-boyfriend was following me to work this morning. There was a big blue pick-up that was trailing me all the way to the office, now it had its visor down and he had a cap on, so I couldn't quite see, but it was the same pick-up that he drove to our house. Honey, there are a lot of blue pick-up trucks. I mean, it could have been anyone. I know that, just please be careful. Now when you get home, promise me you're gonna close and lock all the doors. Even the patio windows, doors, I want them all closed, okay? Okay. I promise. I'll lock her up. Or you and the baby can spend the night here with me. I can scoot over a little bit. Aww. hello? hello? zara? -zara! -Haley, what happened? Are you all right? Is the baby all right? Yeah, I think the baby's okay, but someone's in the house and he just attacked me! We gotta... We gotta get you out of here. no! looks like they went out through the side yard. Are you guys sure you didn't get a glimpse of who it was? Oh, I know who it was. I didn't need to get a glimpse of them. It was obviously callie. I mean, she's the only person that has a key to this house. All right, I'm gonna take miss hayes back to the station for more questioning. You guys sure you didn't see anything else? All right. I'll be back tomorrow morning for a full statement, okay? -Thank you. -Thank you. it's okay. damn it! Reid! What the hell is wrong with you? I thought you were supposed to just scare her. I smothered her, not the baby. What, and nick's accident, was that you, too? That wasn't part of the plan. You could have been caught. We're supposed to be framing callie for all of this. Well, you said you wanted their baby. How else are you supposed to get their baby without getting them out of the way first, huh? What I told you is that I wanted callie out of way so that I could be the godmother. All right, then maybe you should be more specific next time. You want me to be specific? Go. Just get out before haley wakes up. see, uh, your little $100,000 inheritance that you promised me half of, that's not going to cover all of my gambling debts, so you're gonna have to show me some more money if you want me to get outta dodge. Yeah, well, I need to keep some of that money in case I have to move out and pay rent. But if I can convince them to stay in this house, then you can get callie behind bars, I'll send you some. Hmm. Okay. But see, that's not gonna work for me. If I leave, the money goes with me. See, that's what I need here. Besides, you don't really want them hearing about what happened to that last little baby, right? well, I suppose I'll just have to think of some way to tide you over until I can give you more money. ♪ yeah ♪ mm... Two hands, baby. I could do two hands. Hmm. that's not exactly the kind of payday you were hoping for, is it, reid? you know my baby would still be alive today if it wasn't for what you did to me. But my brothers' baby, my baby, he's gonna be happy and loved and cared for, and you are not going to mess it up this time. ♪ yeah ♪♪ -morning. -Morning! Hey, did you and the baby finally manage to get some sleep last night? Well, I've slept better, but I certainly tried. Aww. Look, this baby is gonna be just fine. He or she is gonna grow up to be part of my family's legacy after all. So, uh, I was thinking... I'm not really sure that I can handle the baby shower right now. I think it might just be too much stress for me and the baby. Of course. Yeah. No, we-we, we certainly don't want to stress the sweet little baby, but what if some of the girls still came over to keep you company? I mean, we did already pay for all the food and decorations after all. -I... -Just roz and lydia. Keep it chill. I mean, unless you'd rather just hang with me all weekend? Uh, okay. -Sure, but just us girls. -Of course. And can you email everybody else and let them know we're postponing? I will handle everything. Don't worry. Anything for my sister. I have a surprise for you. uh, what is it? Well, it's upstairs. And it's a surprise! So, come on. Okay. Oh, hey, uh, the other night, when you came to borrow that perfume, which one did you use? It smelled so good I thought maybe I'd wear it for the shower. Oh. Yeah, I think it was, um, the gold one, maybe. I don't know. I don't really remember. surprise! wow, zara, this is... well, it's everything you wanted, right? Yeah, um, it's great. It's just... Uh, oh, oh, you don't like the crib? Well, I-I thought that this was perfect for a little boy or girl. Well, yeah. You knew we were looking at cribs, right? I guess I, I just kind of hoped that nick and I could pick out the one we both wanted. Yeah, yeah, of course. It's just, well, you know, he wants a boy and you want a girl, so this, this is obviously the perfect choice for our sweet little bundle of joy. -Ah. -Our bundle of joy? Oh! That must be the girls. callie, hey. Hi, nick. How did it go with the surgery? Uh, well, elbow hurts a bit, but I'm fine. I heard about what happened with haley at the house last night. Yeah, yeah, she, uh, she came by earlier today. Said that the cops are gonna be staking out the house to make sure that doesn't happen again. Good, that's good. Because you know it wasn't me, right? Callie, I'd like to believe that you would never do anything to harm us, but the police seem to think that you might have been involved. Well, someone certainly made it look like I was. Nick... What do you even really know about zara, hm? Because I think it's all her. Well, I know that she seems attached to haley, likes helping us with the baby, so why would she attack her? I don't know, I don't know, I've been wondering the same thing myself, I just feel like she's been trying to wedge me out since the day she arrived. Well, she does have that crazy ex-boyfriend I was worried about. He brought a gun to our house, so I don't exactly trust her judgment to be honest with you. Look, nick, after I left the station last night, for being questioned yet again, I did a little digging into zara's past. I called your father's old friend who used to be the commissioner. Gerald, yeah, what did you find out? There's a woman here in la who reported zara missing almost two years ago. That's about the time that she left for vegas. But she lived in zara's old address. I mean, don't you think it's just a little bit fishy that zara would just run off to vegas without telling anyone? Yeah, I mean, it does seem a little strange, but what doesn't seem strange for zara right now? Turner was killed with my belt and I sure as hell didn't bring that belt with me when I moved into the hotel, so who took it out of the house, hm? Are you going to the baby shower today? You think zara invited me? Right. Okay, well, can you text gerald to get that old address of, uh... -What was her name? -Stevie. I already did. I was planning on stopping by, but I thought maybe you might wanna come with me. I was supposed to stay another day, but that's not gonna happen. I'm gonna get a car and I'm going to that old address. What, why? Because I need you to go to the house and look after haley. If zara is dangerous, I don't want her anywhere near haley or the baby. okay. you know what? - I think we need a toast. - okay. -Cheers. -Cheers. -Cheers! -Cheers! -Thanks, guys. ♪ she never played the damsel ♪ ♪ if you don't like the blues ♪ what the hell are you doing here? Oh, I'm here to see haley and ruin your perfect day. Ooh, cute balloons, only, don't you know how bad they are for the environment, dear? ♪ would you kill for me? ♪ -haley, hi. Mwah. Mwah. -Callie! Hi. wow. What a nice surprise. Oh, I just brought you a little something. and looking fabulous as always. Well, thank you. The blue one has booze in it. Oh. Okay. Well, I'm feeling a bit sober lately. So, what were we talking about? Why don't we, uh, open the gifts? -Oh, yeah. -Yeah. Perfect. hi, are you stevie santos? I'm stevie. Can I help you? Uh, yeah. I'm nick downes. Sorry, I'd shake your hand if I could... You're fine. What can I do for you? Do you happen to know my sister, zara? She would've been living here a couple years ago? She was an actor. Do you know how many actors move in and out of this place? Sure, um, here, you, you actually reported her missing shortly after she left. Um, yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course, I remember zara, but that's not her. That's her friend that used to be here all the time, I think her name was ronnie or something. What do you, what do you mean this isn't zara? I mean, they both had dark hair and light eyes. And I think they met doing a play playing twins or something, if I recall? I, I don't know, I could be wrong. So if, if this is my sister's friend, then where's my sister, why is this girl saying that she's zara? Look, you're asking the wrong person, man. I don't know. Hey, you reported her missing. Why? Um, I don't know, all I know is that she started, she started calling herself amelia... I don't know, it was, like, for a classier actor name or something, and then she just up and disappeared, just like that one night. So, of course, I reported her missing. She didn't say goodbye, she left all of her crap here. And then I think her and that ronnie girl that was pregnant, I think went off to vegas together. So, this, this girl, she, she was pregnant? Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'd say, I don't know, maybe three or four months long. I think she wanted to get out of town quickly, because there was some crazy dude. I don't know, and zara or amelia, whatever you wanna call her, um, ran along with her. It was funny though, I always felt like zara sort of hated ronnie. Like, she was just keeping her around just to make herself look better or something. I think ronnie kinda hated her, too. -Aww. How cute! -Oh. For above the crib! Oh, gosh, it's so cute. -Thank you. -You're welcome. oh, wow. You guys did such a great job. This baby really cleaned up. - thank you. - you're welcome. okay, now mine! Will you excuse me a moment? Uh, callie, don't you wanna stay here for all the gift openings? of course. I just need to go use the ladies. Uh, don't open up mine without me! Okay. oh, they're so tiny. Yeah, haley, I-I don't think it's safe to be in the house here with her. I... Look, I think that we need to get in the car and go. Callie? Uh, she's not gonna do anything with them here. Look, look how cute. ew. Tacky. -hey, nick. -Callie, what's going on there? You're not gonna believe what I just found in zara's room. you mean the girl who is not zara? Wait, wait, what? What are, what are you talking about? That girl is not my sister, she's someone else. I think she might have killed my sister and is taking her identity. Now I need you to get haley out of there right now. Nick, I just found a construction hat and a vest in her room. Just like the ones from the property site. Get haley out of the house, I'm calling the police, I'm gonna be there in ten minutes. hey, here you go. -It's so big. -I know. oh, how cute. It's an elephant lamp, because elephants bring good luck to babies. -Aw, callie, I love it. -Aw. -Thank you. -Of course. Okay, so, um, I was just thinking that maybe we should call it a day, I mean, haley still needs to get her rest, you know? - Okay. - okay. Guess we'll be going. -We love you. -This was fun. -Can't wait for the big one. -Aw. And your little bundle. -I hope you like your gifts. -I love them. Thank you. -Bye. -Bye. Let me walk you out. Listen, we have to go now. Zara is crazy. Okay, so just follow my lead and let's go quickly. -Wait, wait, what do you mean? -I mean she's nuts. And once your friends are out of here, we're gonna be in a lot of trouble, so let's go. I know, I know that she's a little off, but I don't think she's dangerous. Trust me, zara is very dangerous. - Okay? - zara wasn't. - But I am. - oh, my god. Take the scarf and tie her to the chair. Now. Zara, what are you doing? -Hurry up. -Okay. -No, callie. -It's okay. It's okay. -Okay. -Faster. Look, haley, I'm real sorry about all this. But I'd be more than happy to explain everything to you once... ah! I told you that elephant was lucky. Come on. Let's go. okay. Oh, shoot. -What? -My keys are still out there. -Um, my keys are over here. -Okay. Great. We can go out through the back. Let's go. Come on. come on. okay. I don't think she's back here. Okay. okay. Let's go. okay. come on. shh! okay, come on. oh, callie! Go. haley, that baby's gonna need you to take a nap at some point. let me in! haley! Ah! Haley! why are you doing this, zara? What do you want? well, at first, I just wanted to get close to the two of you, well, and that sweet baby. And you did! You're nick's sister. We let you in to our home. We treated you like family. except, she isn't my sister. -Oh, nick. -Are you? And who told you that? I talked to zara's old roommate. I know you were just friends. What the hell did you do to her? Oh, zara, who suddenly started calling herself amelia because she thought it was classy. She was a pretentious bitch, nick. She didn't start out as my friend. Zara was just some actress who got cast in that role I wanted, and because we looked alike, I was cast as her understudy, and then I was stuck working with her. I was so jealous of her getting that role, I started studying her constantly trying to figure out what it was that she had that I didn't. And as we started to become friends, I learned her mannerisms. She told me all about growing up the illegitimate daughter of a very wealthy man. And I learned pretty quickly she was used to always getting what she wanted. Well, except for that loser, reid. Oh, she wanted him so bad. He wanted me. What the hell did you do with my sister, ronnie? Eliminated my competition, of course. she said you were pregnant. Zara was horrible to me, all right? She was a terrible friend, conniving, and a manipulative roommate. I did you a favor. You should be thanking me. And since my life wasn't worth anything, I just decided to take hers. Besides, I knew that her mom was long gone and she barely had any family to speak of, plus, it was a hell of a lot easier making myself disappear than her. I had nothing, nothing! And who wouldn't kill to be part of a beautiful family dynasty? So that's why you wanted this baby. It wasn't replacing the one that you lost. No. 'cause you're incapable of love. You just wanted a place in this dynasty. It wasn't about this baby at all. It's only about you. You're wrong! I would've loved that baby! It is true, you just want the money and the life that you can get if you take our baby and get rid of us. Well, yeah, I mean, sure, the money and the house, the lifestyle, it certainly wouldn't hurt. Of course, that just couldn't happen now, can it? What about the baby? If you kill me, y-you kill the baby too. No, you haven't exactly given me any other options now, have you? I guess it looks like I'm just gonna have to adopt into the downes dynasty. just, just let me carry the baby to term and I won't tell anybody about any of this, okay? It'll be our secret. I, I was gonna make you the, the new godmother anyway. You can't kill your godchild. You'd really give up on nick that easily? I would do... Whatever I have to do. Just like I'm certain you did with reid. Listen, just don't hurt my baby, okay? You can be the hero. Haley, don't... Please don't, don't do this. Zara, how much I love this baby. okay. Okay. Let's just... Let's just take him to the cliff. And we'll keep it clean and we'll make it look like it was an accident, okay? Don't do this. Move. haley... But, but you... Why? Did what you do best, right? Betray the ones you love. you didn't really think I'd betrayed you, right? nah.
