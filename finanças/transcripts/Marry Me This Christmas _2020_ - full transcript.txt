Hey, y'all got any food? I'm so sorry. Anything? - Not today, sorry. Excuse me, miss, you need any help around the house? Any work? I can do all sorts of work. Hey my brother, you got any, you got any change, bro? Just like a little bit? Excuse me brother man, you can help a brother out? I'm sorry. - Andre Swan? Maybe later. - Hey! Do you mind lending me your arm? I get so clumsy walking in these heels. I was so sorry to hear about you and Mandy breaking up. You poor baby. Hey, excuse me, can y'all spare anything? Any food? Any change? Whatever y'all got. Some people have no manners. Some people have no manners. Relax, Timothy. Was he in some horrible car wreck? Legs broken and fingers all mangled like a bowl of spaghetti? 'Cause that's his only excuse for not calling. He will be here. Have a little faith. Hmm. Mmm mmm mmm. Your slowpoke drivin'! Hey, Mama. - I could have walked quicker. And now, I'm gonna have to sit in the back which you know I hate. You just hate not showing off your hats, Mama. Darryl? Darryl? - Yeah, baby! You got my purse? Yeah baby, you want me to- No, I don't want you to. I'm over here looking like a stuff eggplant. The least you can do is hold my purse. Yeah, baby. I like sittin' up front 'cause I get to show you off. Oh, you. I don't mean to disturb y'all, but uh- Pops, wait up. Your cane! Who said he needed that old thing? Um, his doctors. And I have your pills and if you get tired, just let me know and I'll fix you something to eat. Oh, you've been back two weeks, and you're babying him already. Thank you, Angela baby. Thank you so much. Here you go. But watch out for the lions, they bite. Hey, man. This is my beat. Hey, I'll be gone in like 60 seconds, I swear. I'm watching you. Well, that's it. He's impossibly late. All right, Hazel, fire up that organ. I guess I'm goin' on. You'll have to do the sermon too. I know, Timothy. You got this, baby. * He's got the whole world * In His hands * He's got the whole wide world * In His hands * He's got the whole world * In His hands * He's got the whole world in His hands * He's got the whole world in His hands * Amen! Hallelujah, and welcome y'all to the house of God. Amen! Amen! - Amen. Amen to you too, brother. As you know, the time for my retirement draws nigh. To every season, the board and I have identified my prospective replacement, a caring, energetic young pastor who's supposed to be here, but seems to have caught himself in traffic. Excuse me, mind if I sit here? First reading? Go on, get up. 'Cause it's open, right? Nope? Hey my brother, can I just scoot in- Thank you, baby. Hey my man, can I sit for the church- First reading's from Psalm 25. Remember Lord, your tender mercies and your loving kindness for they are eternal. Excuse me, mind if I just sit there? Remember not my youthful transgressions- but remember me in light of your- - What about right here? You sure you're in the right place? This is church, ain't it? Then would you please find a seat? I'm trying, brother. They've got no room at the inn. Therefore, uh- Hallelujah! Can I get an amen, y'all? Amen! - Amen! That's enough. Now, praising God is all very well and good, but for heaven sake, not in a church! Please, follow me to the back. No! I got something to say. Uh oh. Now one Sunday, way over in Tannaville when I was about yay-high, we was all sittin' in church, just like some of y'all is doin' right now. And who strolls in? But this homeless brother. He looking all scraggly and stanky. And this brother, he looking for food, right? And he's looking for work. Oh I think I get it. What? And wasn't nobody giving him nothing. Matter of fact, there was this one little boy, he booed him. And then about halfway through the service, the homeless man revealed his true identity. He was a pastor from a visiting church. We were ashamed, 'cause we treated this homeless brother so bad. Me most of all. - Come sit down. But I was also inspired 'cause I realized there's opportunity for change everywhere. In other words, it ain't all about you. My name is Daniel English and I hope to be your new pastor. You gotta be kidding me. Now, hold on, hold on, hold on. Before you condemn my theatrics, that pastor in disguise? That was none other than my mentor, Reverend John Treadgold. And that little boy who booed? Yeah, that was me. Listen, I'm not perfect y'all, but I believe that love is service, and I promise to serve this community with all my heart. Amen. All right, see y'all next week. Come back please, please come back, come back y'all. Well done, son. Thank y'all for coming. Shana, right? - Yeah. Yeah, I went to high school with Angela. You wouldn't remember me, I was two grades- Danny English? Yeah, everybody remembers Daniel English. You pretty much ran that school. Talked me into missing Thanksgiving to feed the homeless, twice. Yeah, and I see you still haven't kicked the habit. Wait, so are you a preacher or homeless? Or a homeless preacher? He was playin', just like you play at barbecuing. Let's go. My feet are killing me. I couldn't have done it better myself In fact, I didn't do it better. Well I'm just glad it worked. Not sure Deacon Jones is a fan though. Ah, don't sweat Timothy. He's a good man but he's a bit of a stickler. So, kitchen straight ahead, stairs to your apartment through those doors and these are our offices. Mrs. Ramirez, meet Pastor Daniel English. Hi. - Hi. This place would grind to a halt if it wasn't for Mrs. R. Oh you and your wondelfluff. And our lay director, Deacon Timothy Jones. Deacon Jones, back on D! Rams defensive end? NFL Hall of Famer? Never heard of him. Not a football fan, noted. Anyway, I'm sorry about the whole pastor-in-disguise thing- No, no, no, no. That's all me. I insisted no one know except for me and Hazel. If I was able to play a small part in today's lesson, I'm glad. Well, it won't happen again, 'cause I'm all out of disgusting pants. Mm. Well, your office. Great, thank you, John. Reverend, regarding my memo about a dress code? I would like a word. Talk to him. He's in charge now. Ah, dress code? Mrs. Ramirez? What do you say we get this party started, huh? Well, I'm afraid you have just a trevocious day in front of you, Pastor Daniel. Oh, you have a meeting with the Sunday school teacher. Okay. Oh, and you have an interview with a possible music director. Oh, and you have an AA meeting in the conference room with one Benny Nugent. Oh! Forget I said that. I know, I know. It is supposed to be anonymous. Way trevocious. Oh, and you have 26 lunch requests, including three from one, Jan Find-Me-a-Man McCann. Jan who? Oh, that's just what we call Jan McCann. I mean she is lovely. She's just a little bit finucular. Contelptuous. Rambortly. Ram, okay, you know, tell Jan Miss-Can't-Find-a-Man McCann that lunch must be replanned. * Eyes off my cookies. I was not looking. * * * Mrs. Ramirez, can we please request a coffee maker at our next budget meeting? The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak. Oh dear! You look like somethin' the cat dragged through a marathon. Shall I cancel your next- No, no, no, no, don't cancel. What's next? Well, you got a call with the building inspector, oh, next week's readings to select. Deacon Jones wants to talk you about the daycare and an Angela Reed is here to see you. Angela? In there. I think she's still there. Angela Reed. It feels like it was just yesterday. Wait, it was. Please sit down, sit down. And if it's about the cookies, you can't have 'em. I'm saving 'em. Why? You were like the only one who even acknowledged my existence. They're like my new symbol of hope. Matter of fact, I might get 'em glazed in bronze. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Here, no, no, you can eat all my cookies. I'm sorry, this is so embarrassing. No, no, no, no. Embarrassing is that kid doing magic tricks at the school play who fell off the stage. That was you. That's even more embarrassing. Take your time, take your time. Okay, now deep breath. And hit me. It's my dad. He's unwell. Yeah, I saw the cane. It's cancer in his back and hips. He was treated two years ago for a tumour in his lungs, but now- It's metastasized? He doesn't want chemo. Radiation? How's his spirits? He puts on a brave face, very stoic and all but, I just know he's so disappointed it came back. The whole family's pretending everything's fine. My mom's in denial, Shana's busy with her own family, I didn't know where else to turn. Then seeing you... You know, I have an idea. You do? - Yeah. I'm not just some dude in a weird shirt. I have a Masters in Family and Marriage Counselling, I've been doing this for years. So how about we start with me coming over for a family lunch tomorrow? Oh. - Say noon? Okay, lunch. - Yeah? Okay, good. * Shorty said you need a patience in relations * Mans can't be no waste man in relations * Gotta build it from the base, man * If you never want that imitation, right * I just told her that I'm trying to run the bases * That's a home You all right there? Yeah. I'm just smelling these. Don't worry, they're not for you. I mean, they're for your mom. Coming in your house. Yeah. - All right. Y'all remember Pastor English? Hey, everybody. Mr. Homeless. And please, call me Daniel. No, no, Mr. Reed, don't get up. Call me Pops, everybody does. Mrs. Reed, these are for you. Ooh, aren't you sweet? Shana, you're huge. When's the due date? Not soon enough. Shana's husband, Darryl. He's a dentist if you're ever in need. Just so you know, I hate goin' to church. I only go 'cause I'm dragged. Well now you know how I feel about going to the dentist. No I'm serious, I, I really don't like the dentist. Uh huh. Anyway, you have a beautiful home. You know, "A room without books "is like a body without a soul," somebody once said. Cicero. 32 years high school Lit. But I prefer, "Knowledge makes a man unfit to be a slave." Frederick Douglass. Mm, somebody got a A in English. Oh Daniel, you think you might baptize Shana's baby? Oh I love kids, say no more. Y'all think about godparents? Angela for sure and we were gonna ask Monty. Ah, who-who's Monty? Just a guy I used to date. Angela's ex. Like ex-boyfriend, ex? Let's eat already, hmm, I'm starving. Okay. Darryl? - Yeah, baby? Help me up. Oh. Jelly, come help me with the salad. Yeah I'm coming. - Ah, Mrs. Reed? How can I help? You know, I live to serve. You can keep the old man company. That's work enough. I heard that. Ah. Darryl, get in this kitchen. Yeah, baby. Pops, I, uh, I hear you're a bit under the weather. Son, I know why you're here, and I would like your help. Help me plan my funeral. Wait, what? Look, my wife may be fooling herself, but I'm not. And Angie, she always trying to fix things. And I won't make it worse for her with foolishness. Okay, Pops, Pops, hold on. We're not built like that, okay? We're fighters. You ever hear the quote, "If you run into a wall, don't turn around and give up. "Figure out a way to climb it, "work around it or go through it." Harriet Tubman? Michael Jordan. Let's make a deal. Preachers make deals? All the time. How you think I got this job? How about you fight. For them. 'Cause they need you, and they need you to be strong. And all this talk about planning funerals, we're gonna put that on hold, okay? Deal? Let's do it. All right. Lunch is ready. All right, let's eat. Pastor Daniel, care to say grace? Hmm. Heavenly Father, bless this food and this very special family. As we approach the holiday season, thinking of Mary, Joseph and Baby Jesus, we're reminded that love is family, Amen. Amen. So Daniel, is there a Mrs. Pastor? You got a honey in Charlottesville? Pops! We ain't Catholic! No sir. You finished high school, you became a preacher. What happened in between? College in New Hampshire, Peace Corps in New Guinea, and Seminary in New Jersey. And three years assistant chaplain at UVA. And now you're a pastor back in your hometown. No, a provisional pastor. There's a trial period before the Reverend retires so, assuming I don't screw up, the gig is mine January 1st. Angie just moved back herself. The minute that she got her VP stripes at Kelley Bank & Trust, she quits to start this non-profit. It's really a non-profit to help non-profits. See, a lot of folks wanna get involved, but don't know where to start. My idea is to link would-be volunteers with charities through corporate volunteerism initiatives. If it works, it'll be a win-win- Win. - Win. Yeah, it's brilliant. And those big companies should pay a pretty hefty consultant fee. Yeah. If you need any help, let me know. Matter of fact, let's make a toast. Cheers. * Pops hasn't been that lively there in weeks. What did you say to him anyway? Oh we just, you know, talked about basketball. Well, whatever you said, thanks. Speaking of food, I heard your fellow schemer friend from high school is now head chef at some fancy restaurant. Kadeem? - Yeah. Kadeem Standish? Yeah, you should look him up. Okay, I will, tha- Hold on a second, schemer? Yeah, schemer. Aways talking somebody into something. Oh, you still mad because I made you miss Thanksgiving dinner? Turkey with cranberry sauce and gravy is my favourite meal. I die before you, St. Peter, do not let her in. So who's here? Pastor Daniel or Danny English from Luther Lee High? Do I have to choose? No, no, it's just, sometimes when you talk... I got a plan- - We should do this again. You do? I think I can help. I wanna talk to your dad, and your mom, but like not all formal counselling, more casual? With your blessing. Daniel, consider yourself blessed. * I wanna be with you * You wanna be with me too * You want me to like sequel * Girl I, girl I * I wanna be with you * If you want to be with me too * Then don't study about what she do * Don't I, don't I * Always I look for you * Always I check for you * Always I look and that's why * Girl I, girl I * I wanna be with you * You wanna be with me too * You want me to like sequel * * Yeah, its been a while * Since the last time I saw you * And I've seen your smile Excuse me, can I talk to the manager? Daniel? Oh, my main man of the cloth. Kadeem Standish. What's up? You looking good. Except for the hair loss and extra weight, all them wrinkles on your face. And you, you're a head chef? - Yeah. I'm calling the FDA now and the EPA and the FCC, I'm calling everybody. I guess you don't want none of my linguine bolognese then, huh? Okay. Man, you got a nice place here, man. You know, I was thinking, you remember that food drive we did back in 10th grade? Mm. What if I take all the extra food that y'all throw out and bring it down to the homeless shelter? You could set me up? My man! You smart, man, you smart. Mmm. Mhm. It's not bad for an atheist, huh? So how long these gigs last for? Like two, three years? As pastor? I may never leave. Hey, beautiful town, nice folks, mediocre pasta. Well just welcome back then, all right? Hey, you seeing anybody? Yeah, yeah, I ran into this one girl, Angela. Angela Reed? - Angela Reed. Smart, super cute, dad is a teacher? Yeah, he's um, he's not well right now so I've been helping out as their pastor. Also, I have a huge crush on her. Oooh! Return of the Mac! Hey, bring her through. I mean, I'll make y'all a special romantic dinner. Nah, she doesn't know. At least I don't think she does. Well, didn't you bust a move? Bust a move? Kadeem, I'm going to chemo with her dad, I'm counselling their whole family. I can't- - Ask her out? No! She's just like awesome, beautiful woman who came to me at her most vulnerable moment. I can't cross that line. If you're not gonna bust a move, at least just talk to her. I mean, it's century 21, dawg. Women dig that stuff, supposedly. I will. I've gotta wait for the right time. Well don't wait too long. Know what they say? Spooners better than ladle, right? Spooner, ladle. Yeah, yeah, I got it. Darryl, the door. The turkey will be there tomorrow. Here you go, baby. Thank you. Here we go. Baby Katherine. In the house. - Shhhhh! Happy Thanksgiving, Jelly. Happy Thanksgiving! Aww, isn't she the most adorable thing in the world? You're sweet. I swear she added five years to Pops life. Have you told Monty about her? Monty? - Mhm. No, why would I? Oh. I don't know, I just thought maybe he should know. I mean, they were pretty close. Yeah, maybe I should. Darryl, get in the kitchen. I'm hungry, I didn't have- You're always hungry. Come on. I'm just take this for the road though- What- Just for the road. What, where you going? Isn't Daniel coming? Nah, he's helping out at his shelter all day. Y'all cozy I noticed. Any late night smooching behind the church? No! Not yet, I mean. - Mhm. Whatcha waiting for? Hey. We missed you yesterday. Sorry, sorry, I got cornered by Deacon Jones, again. Turkey with cranberry sauce and stuffing. What, my favourite. - My favourite. Yeah. What's with you and this park anyways? It's like your third time here. Pops and I used to come here when I was a kid. Just me and him. Might be my favourite place in the world. Yeah, plus everyone needs a little push every now and then, right? Yeah, speaking of which. - Uh huh. You've been so generous with your time and attention. All the affection you've given me and my family. So, I was wondering, would you do that for any family or? Yes! - Is it something special for us or- No. Both. I don't know, what's the question? No, no, I'm-I'm just tryna get a sense of- Angela I mean, I like you. I do. And your whole family. And you, its just, I don't want you to think I'm taking advantage or- No, no, that-that's not what I'm saying at all. Because I got this duty, right? I got this calling that comes first. I mean, what kind of pastor would I be if I didn't. I-I see. But that doesn't mean I don't have feelings. 'Cause I do. I mean, what kind of man would I be if I didn't. And those feelings... Are big, big feelings. Amazing feelings, new feelings. But I can't just act on them, right? I mean, what kind of man would I be if I did? Okay. You-you have feelings but- - Uh huh. I mean, it's not easy wearing this collar. No, 'cause that means somebody else will just step up. So you, um- Your-your hands are tied so somebody else is just gonna get there first. Right. Yes. Okay, um, I understand I think. Yeah, well- I gotta go. - Okay. You know, Pops big check-up and all. Right, right. Angela, um- Yeah? Thanks, for lunch. Uh huh. Thanks for lunch? It's one little test, it's no big deal. I know, I know. I just, "Leukocytes, "13,500." Okay, it's high but it's not that high. Tea. You want some tea? Imma make you a nice pot of green tea. Ah... Okay, it didn't shrink but at least it's not growing. I should have been an engineer. Other folks leave their kids houses, trust funds. And all you get is my golf clubs. Stop. I don't want your golf clubs. Good, 'cause I lost my six iron. You're gonna live to a hundred, okay? All the things I wanted to do. Travel with your mother, walk you down the aisle, play with my grandkids. Life is so short, Angie. But don't worry, I'm a fighter. And I ain't giving up. Just, find what makes you happy. Will you do that for me? Pops? * * Hey. I need to see you. * Well, the programs for the Christmas play do need your approval. We still haven't set a lunch with Jan Find-Me-a-Man McCann, and your mother sent you this defraulable sweater. Oh thanks. Oh, you are most welcome. Now I'm gonna to go home, right after I tinkle. Night! - TMI Mrs. R. TMI. The door is always open Mrs. R... Angela, hey. Hope I'm not disturbing. No, no, not at all. How is Pops? MRI shows no shrinkage and his white blood cell count spiked. Oh, that's not great. Yeah. But it's to be expected. And he's a champ, so. Look, I've got a question. About the other day, oh. You go- You go first. It's alright. - Okay, um. Okay well, first of all, thank you again for everything. Oh, it's my pleasure. For real. Yeah, you've been so great, Daniel. Uh huh. Like really. And then, we've been spending all this time together, you and me, and- I'm such a fan. I feel so close to you. Yeah, me too, to you. So I've been thinking a lot lately and, I have this question and its gonna sound all of a sudden, but I'm just gonna come out and say it. Okay. Daniel, - Uh huh? Will you marry me? Huh? Ah... Oh. Wow. I-I don't know what to say. Of course I know what to say. Uh, yes, this is incredible, yes! Okay, my fiancé will be thrilled. Huh? Yeah, my fiancé. Fiancé? Yeah, Monty. Monty Fassbeck, the on-again off-again boyfriend? Oh no, I remember off-again. Yeah, off-again. We got to talking and boom! Ah, boom! We got engaged. Okay, Monty Back-Fest. You want me to marry you to Monty Back-Fest? Fassbeck, yeah. Mm. I mean, you do do weddings, don't you? Oh yeah, yeah I do weddings. I marry people all the time to other people, non-stop. I told him how great you've been and he-and he thought it'd be terrific. Well, that's great. Terrific. Da bomb. I don't know, you seem kind of- Thrilled, I'm thrilled! 'Cause you're getting married, it just, you know, it feels a little fast. Y'all gonna have like a long engagement? Like real long? No, soon. Four weeks from now- Oh, four weeks, that's fast. You sure that's a good idea given your dad's condition? Daniel, it's because my dad's sick we're doing it this way. So, can I count on you? Can't wait to meet him. Great. I did what you said. You know, I talked to her. I told her I had feelings, big feelings, but I also had this calling so, somebody else has to step up because I couldn't. So, you said that you're so tight with God you can't make a move? Yeah, and then she goes and gets engaged to Monty. I'll be honest: I think you flat out rejected her for Jesus. No, no, no, I chose my words very carefully. And then she goes with Monty? He's nasty. You haven't even met him. I mean, Mr. Cool. I could take it or leave it. Well then how come he didn't just leave it? I don't know, man, just give me that. You know, I could've made a move, but I didn't. And you know why? I'm a good guy. You're a nice guy. I'm a nice guy. The best. - I'm the best guy. Sadly, nice guys tend to finish last. He's all wrong for her, man. You know, she's sweet and kind and charitable. And she's a worrier, but she's funny. And he's like- He's what? Bro, he's a banker. Hey man, my mom's a banker. My bad. I mean, if they're so perfect together, how come they keep breaking up? You're always saying "It ain't about you." So just go meet the brother. Maybe he's right for her, maybe you'll love him. Why are we meeting this guy again? He's our pastor and a friend. You're friends with your pastor? Ain't that kinda weird? Be nice, I told you he's been great. Fine, what's his name again? Daniel English. Monty Fassbeck, nice to meet you. Come on in, come on in. Please take a seat and congratulations all 'round. Thank you. - Thanks. It's been a tough time but we're making the best of it, right, honey? Oh yeah, timing. Timing is everything. Gets you every time, that time... Anyway, that's why I'm here to help. 'Cause I want you- Daniel. - Uh huh? Can I call you Daniel? I feel like you a friend of the family. I just wanna say thanks for taking care of Pops. Ah. Angela's been singing your praises. That's me. Just a good old friend - Hm. Of the family. So I hear you guys took some time off, huh? On a little break as they say? Look, sometimes life kicks you in the as- Not in here, buddy. - Ankle. - Okay. And wakes you up. Plus, at a certain point you can't stay single forever. Right, right, so you guys were broken up, right? Going your separate ways for the rest of your life- Daniel, let's concentrate on the wedding, 'kay? Just want my girl to be happy. Yeah, me too. Both of you to be happy 'cause marriage is happy. Okay. Babe? Thank you, Daniel. All right, y'all get home safe. Can't wait for the next one. * Hey. Hey, your name is Crenshaw, right? What, man, I'm not hurting nobody. Hey, I'm not trying to chase you away. I just, I wanna give you a sweater. It's hideous. Hey Crenshaw, let me ask you a question. Mhm? You ever been in love? Why? What do you care? But I have. It's brutal. You want this? I'm not hungry. There was this girl, a parishioner, we've been spending all this time together and- Her name was Jules. She was a dancer. Hm. I wanted to get married and move to the Poconos. She had this dream about making it big, in Reno. I let her go. Didn't fight, I just- Biggest mistake of my life. You? The girl I'm in love with just got engaged to another man. Ouch. A nice enough guy but, just feels wrong. Do you love her? You gotta fight for her. Fight for her? You wanna end up like me? No. - No. I mean, can I fight for her though? Man, if love ain't worth fighting for, what is? What is? Fight for her. I don't even know how. Okay well, look your doing the whole ceremony thing, ain't ya? Mhm. Okay, you just gotta show 'em that they're a bad match. What you gotta lose, man? Not a blessed thing. Mhm. Thank you, Crenshaw. You wanna thank me, how 'bout some salsa? Preacher? Yo! Pico de galla wouldn't kill ya to put a little pico de gallo on this? I like music as much as anyone, but we need to spend money where it'll be most effective. Mrs. R, have you seen my blue binder? Pastor, nice of you to join us. We were discussing the budget shortfall of $5,500. Now, when we retire, you're gonna need to hire a new organist. And Timothy's plans for the new daycare has already been- Approved by the board and we simply cannot afford both. Where is it? - Excuse me? Ah, yes. John, you're moving to Nashville, right? Why? To be close to your grandkids. Can we please focus on- Don't spend money on daycare. This church is full of wonderful grandparents who would love to take care of children and working folks for nothing. Well, it's a little more complicated- No, it's not. We did it at my last church, it worked out great. So we can afford to hire an organist after all? We don't have to hire anybody. That's a Rodgers 535 Digital organ, a top-notch instrument. Folks would kill to play that, am I right Hazel? Yeah. Okay, so let's track down some local instructors, let them use our organ for free for lessons, recitals, whatever, if they agree to play hymns on Sundays. Yes? Good? Alright. I gotta bounce, peace. Well, I-I-I guess the-the meeting is adjourned. Amen to that. Hey, guys. So, I spoke to the higher-ups and I was able to get you the full wedding package. Yeah, yeah, all the help you could ever want. The full monty. Yeah? No, not you, bro. Anyway, um, it's part of our new program, the Silver Linings Package. "Silver Lining"? As in, "Things are awful but look on the bright side"? Yeah, I mean, the name needs a little work. Anyway, so it's basically like the full wedding smorgasbord, come on, bro, package. It's like-it's like a wedding buffet, if you will. I really think you guys are gonna love it cuz I love to plan weddings. - Oh, that sounds great. - Yeah. So, let's start with the vows. Traditional or creative? Uh, standard I guess. - Oh, I've always wanted to write my own vows. More romantic, right? Let somebody else do it? That's lame. Okay, moving on. Music. Old hymns or modern? Um, modern? Oh, I love those old hymns, "Oh Happy Day", "Abide with Me". You gotta keep it old school. You know, the organ playing in the background? Yeah, it gets me right here. Fine,"Amazing Grace" it is. "Amazing Grace", yes. All right, Monty. For you, the groomsmen. Can't Angela do this stuff? You know, I trust her judgement. It's supposed to be the most incredible day of your life, bro. Should matter to ya. Should matter to both of you. So Monty, um, groomsmen. Aisle or alter? Honestly, I don't care. Okay. He does not care. All right, let's put this aside for now and talk about flowers. Ugh. What about roses? * * * I want the chocolate cake! I'm going to hell. Wedding plans going good? Yeah. Thank god for Daniel. Thank god for Daniel? He's amazing. We're so on the same wavelength. Yeah, timing. Daniel this, Daniel that. You still like him! Shana, I'm jumping the broom in two weeks. So? You can still like him. The question is, do you like him or like like him? There's lots of people you might like in life. You can't marry them all. So what if I like him like him? Nothing. It's just a funny thing to say two weeks before you jumping the broom. You got an empty space there by the way. Here. * Well, congratulations. The wedding planning is officially done. Thank- - You! Daniel, for everything. Yes, thank you for, uh- Yeah. Next, uh, is- complimentary marriage counselling. Yeah, by me. It's all part of the Silverado Nuptial Bonanza package. Wait, we've-we've dated for three years. Marriage is work my brother, even at the best of times. I mean, look at the divorce rate. Plus with your on and off-again history, Montell, may I call you Montell? It's Montgomery, so no. We insist. Um, children? Yeah, we both want kids- I mean, how many you got, bro? That you know of? Is that really on the form? Can I see that? - No, sorry. None. None. No kids. That he knows of. Moving right along. Now, if we're talking about kids, is Angela gonna stay home? No. - Yes. Oh snap. Maybe part-time for a while, but I'm definitely gonna keep working. Babe, I make plenty of money. That's not the point. My non-profit is important to me. Marriage is compromise and the kids need their mama. The kids also need to see their mom is a strong woman, making a difference. May I make a suggestion with respect? Can you not! With respect. Oh, ex- Can you guys hold on for a second? I just gotta- Just your basic stolen property form, but if you ask me, we should keep this whole 211 scandoozle on the DL, you feel me? Oh smart. If word gets out we lost a tin cup from Arnold's Discount Religious Emporium, all hell's gonna break loose. True that. Oh, also, Jan McCann Find-Me-a-Man is almost here. That's today? Yeah. Ah, um- Could you head her off for me? Meaning, could you find her and make sure she doesn't get lost? Okay. Okay. He's shady. You think maybe he's got a little crush on me? Please. What straight man cares that much about flowers? Wow. - Mhm. Oh no! No. Pastor Daniel, Pastor Daniel! You remember, Jan McCann Find-Me-a-Man? Tee. Manatee, is what I would like for my Christmas present this year. Bye. Jan, hey, um, this is Monty Back-Fest. Fassbeck. And Angela Reed. I'm marrying them. To each other. Angie? It's me, Jan McCann from Luther Lee. Oh my god, girl, how you been? So good! Happily divorced. And you are getting married? I love me a wedding. Okay now. Ah weddings, yes. I love weddings too. Matter of fact, I'm, uh, thinking about getting married myself. Really? - Uh huh. Wait, I thought you said you were too busy with work to get married? Angela, I meant work, like work, work, work, work, like Rihanna. Oh, okay. When were y'all two talking about- I need woman. Mmm. Anyway, I gotta go, guys. Jan and I have some serious bites on the books. Take care y'all. - Mm. Let's just go. Well, alright. What's your favourite vegetable? I mean, lettuce, I guess. Lettuce? Mmm. It's just water. We're 99 % water so- My gosh and you're smart too. How come we never hooked up in high school? Were you one of those nerdy types, always in the library? Ah, I guess so. I also ran that lip sync contest, Students Against Lupus. Yes, I didn't do it. But didn't Angela, you know, go as Pepa from Salt-N-Pep- She was Salt, yeah. They performed "Shake That Thang" and got in 2nd place. She was awesome. I can't remember who played Pepa though. I was in the Drama Club. Love me some drama. How's your salad? So what'd ya eat? Did he pay? Isn't he funny? Um, Food, Damn straight and Not much. Really? I think he's hysterical. So what'd y'all talk about? Me, high school. You kept popping up. Really? He's kinda quiet. Head wrapped up in churchy stuff I suppose, so I did most of the talking. Sounds like a dud. No, we're going out on Thursday. He's cute. Why are you asking? No reason. You just don't seem like his type. Yo yo yo! Hey everybody. Good morning. All right, all right. Hello, hello. Okay, Okay. So, we are here today to welcome baby Katherine into our community. A Holy and sa- cred, um, thing. Passage, rite of passage. So who stands to, um, sponsor Katherine today? We do. All right, all right. Monty, why don't you hold the baby? Yeah, why not? Y'all are family, right? Don't be shy, come on. Make sure you hold the head, godfather. Okay, all right. Yeah, you look real comfortable. You know, children are a natural outcome of marriage. This is why good parenting and godparenting are so important. She's a baby, not a cocktail shaker. It's a sin, really, to know that one parent can ruin an entire family. Matter of fact, it is the leading cause of divorce in the universe. Really? Yes, Mr. Stock Broker. According to the, uh, Research Institute of, uh, the Natural- Paediatric and Family Sciences, 45 million families are torn apart because the papa was an incompetent jerk. Shh, shh. Just, uh, pat her back. It'll make her burp. Can't somebody- This is why godparents are so important. So Angela, Monty, I'm holding you all personally responsible for the religious growth of Katherine. Easy, Desi Arnaz, she's not a friggen bongo. Monty, the name "Katherine" is honoured because uh, she is the- Holy Mother of God! No, no, that would be Mary. It's actually the wife of Martin Luther. Somebody needs to go back to Sunday School. Okay, can somebody please take this little monster away from me. Come to Daddy. Whoop, there it is, ha. Well that's a damn shame. Come sit down, baby. Jan, take a picture of someone else for a change. That's it! I saw this boy one day and the look on his grill, I done busted a gut. Sometimes laughter is the best medicine, huh? Amen. Amen. You all right, Pops? You need anything? Never better, darling. Never better. We need to talk. Sweetheart, come over here for a moment. First off, what's so funny? There's a little something called parishioner-pastor confidentiality. Oh. - I'm sorry. How's the, uh, godfather? Changing his shirt. - Mm. So you don't think he'll be much of a daddy, huh? Me? When did I say that? Yeah, like you're some expert. Wow, you really are a pro. You learned that in divinity school? The eldest of five siblings. And I was changing diapers before I was out of them. Ha ha. Okay, there you go. Goodnight sweet Katherine. Adorable. Hey, you wanna make a baby mobile? Now how could you possibly know what that is? Prayer. Plus it's my gift. Yo, Shana, you see Angie? Yeah, she and Daniel went up to put the baby down. That boy is a saint. Saint, huh? I'm mad at you, you know. You are? Why? You said you had this vocation, this calling from God. Next thing I know, you're going on dates. Well maybe I saw what Monty had. What you and Monty have. Weasel. It's a squirrel, knucklehead. So, how's it going? With Jan, I mean, if you don't mind me asking. Do you think it's serious? I don't know. I mean, when did you know if it was serious with Monty? Not sure. Not sure it's serious now. Well, he put a ring on it, so. You just don't like bankers. I used to be a banker, you know? I know, I love bankers. You should hang out with him. He's a really good guy. Yeah, and is that why you're marrying him? Yeah, he's smart, works hard. He goes for it, you know? Hmm. Women's lib, 21st century or not, a brother still has to step it up. Angela, I just want you to be happy. That's all. You ever think about taking off that collar and just saying what you mean? Yo, Monty wants to see you now. Now, huh? Yo Danny-boy, I realize b-ball is too low brow for a high minded pastor like you, but we need a fourth. Oh. Woo! Don't let the collar fool you. Okay, it's on preacher. You in my church now. All right, let's play twos, let's play twos! * Play deep, play deep. I'm open, I'm open. Pass me the rock. Pass me the rock. I'm open, pass me the rock. What's up? I'm open. That's what I'm talking about. You wanna play, huh? All right. All right, lets do it. - Ready? Okay. Woo! Woo! Go Monty! What's up? Okay, come with it. All right. Okay, I see. * Come on, Monty. You got this. Go Monty, let's go. I'm neutral. Wassup, man? Boo-yah! Tie game! That's a foul, wasn't it? Foul? You really wanna call a foul, Danny? No foul. Tie game. Alright then. Daniel, you all right? All right. Let's do this. Come on, Pastor. * Now that's a foul. Baby, you're bleeding. It's okay, it's nothing but a little scratch. Hey, Monty-Monty. That's my bad, man. I've been thinking about my vows. Ow! - Sorry, baby, that hurt? Ow! Yeah! 'Cause you keep poking at it. What I want in a marriage. And being a stay-at-home baby-mama just ain't it. Baby. Look, marriage is about compromise. Your parents will tell you the same thing. Yeah, but what about sharing goals together? Sharing goals? Where is this coming from? Look I compromise, why shouldn't you? Yeah? What's your compromise? We're getting married, aren't we? Mhm. - I- Angela- - Okay. Come on, Angela. Wow-wee! It is darker than a catafalque in here. Rabbi Simon called you back about a joint service and Deacon Jones called and he does not like that wreath on the door. He says it is paganistical. Oh, and you gotta do a coffee with Jan- You know those plants are fake, right? I know that. Also, the po-po is here. What? The 5-0, the fuzz, the Les gendarmes. Police is outside waiting for ya. Howdy, officer. Don't shoot. Kidding. Kinda. We apprehended this vagrant for loitering and found this cup in his possession. Recognize it? Yes. He says he didn't steal it. Says you gave it to him. Man, why you always gotta pick on me. I recommend you remember your right to remain silent, bub. So, did you give it to him? No. I gave him the chalice and the candlesticks, which Mr. Crenshaw apparently forgot. They're more valuable as a set, remember? Wait, wait, wait. So- Keep up the good work, officer. And try not to beat up any suspects on your way home, okay? Bub-bye. I swear, I was gonna return it- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Combat boots, fatigues. You served, right? You got more principles than me. Like I said Crenshaw, your not a bad dude, man, you just fell on some hard times. So consider that a down payment on your soul. Really? Yeah. You belong to goodness now. That was, that was- Words fail me. Wow, not for long. Hey, I got this thing at the hospital. Can you tell Jan McCann I'm sorry? Wish me luck. Good luck. * I wanna thank you for keeping me in the fight. But I need a favour. Yeah yeah, what you need? A magazine or pillow? Nurse can I, uh- It's Angela. She's afraid. Afraid of losing me. You've been such a good friend to her. Have I? What's on your mind, son? I think she might be rushing into this marriage. Could be. But she's gonna make her own choices. For better or worse. Man, what if it's a mistake? Why don't you tell her, son? Yeah maybe I just, um- You know, I've been feeling a little lost lately. You try prayer? I heard it works sometimes. Well, God's been sending me mixed signals so, um, but the truth is Pops- Pops and Daniel, two of my faves. Hey, Angela. How's the patient? You know, fighting the good fight. Mhm. Good, 'cause he'll be walking me down the aisle next Saturday. - Mhm. Coffee? Yeah, yeah. Angie can we talk? I wanted to say sorry about the whole hitting Monty thing. It was an accident, I swear. Is he okay by the way? He's fine. - Okay, good. You know men, big babies. And I also wanted to say sorry about interfering with your wedding and the cakes and the flowers- Yeah, you were just trying to help. I just want what's best for you and I'm trying so hard and I feel like I'm screwing up- Sorry this, sorry that. Chill already. You sacrifice so much for everybody else and then beat the man inside just for being human. That's what I love most about you. You do? I know it isn't all about you, but sometimes it could be a little about you, right? Yeah. Jan McCann's a lucky girl, you ever figured that out. Yeah, that's not happening. Really? - Nah. I mean, I'm sorry. Well, what happened? I dunno, maybe I saw what Monty has. I mean, what you and Monty have and I couldn't settle, which brings me to what I- - Monty? No, it's kind of about Monty but- Monty. My bad, what were you saying? Uh, nothing. Nothing. For you. I'm sorry. Appreciate it. I'm gonna put these in some water. Okay. Ah, yeah, hey, I'm real sorry about the whole busting you in your face with the basketball thing. Devil made me do it. Forgotten and forgiven. Cool, cool, cool, cool. And to prove it, I insist you come to my bachelor party. Oh, I insist, don't invite me. Just dinner, with friends. Four-star, nothing tawdry. Look uh, Angie and I had a little tiff and I know she wants us to be friends so, you'd be doing me a favour. Okay. Sweet. - Yeah. Thanks for coming, baby. How was the wedding? Go back to sleep, Daddy. What, whatever happened to that nice preacher fellow? Who, Daniel? He's crazy about you. You need to be with someone who's crazy about you. Oh well. Too late now, I guess. Monty Fassbeck. Hey, it's Jan McCann. Uh, who? Jan McCann as in Find-Me-a-Man? Oh, of course, Jan. Yeah, how you doing? About the same as you 'cause we got the same problem. A certain pastor named Daniel. Ring any church bells? Sure do. Well did you also know about his fondness to ditch me to hang out with a certain parishioner named Angela? As in Angela Reed? As in your fiancé? I'm all ears. Pray continue. Hey Monty, what's the football coach ask for at the bank? Quarterback. Hey, you know what's funny? Brian from Sales was trying to give me stock advice. What? I mean, come on. Yo, which one is he? The brother at the end. Oh, the handsome dude? Oh you toast, bro. I mean, you got nice shoes. Hey, find out if he got a sister for me. Just find out. Pastor Daniel, come on. Okay, yeah. Thanks, Darryl. So, uh, you come here often? Man I love steak but Shana don't let me out too much. Is that healthy? Red meat's bad for you. No, no, I wasn't talking about- Well, all good things must come to an end. The Big Dog's finally settling down. Woo, yeah! Okay okay okay. Settle down, settle down, settle down. We got clergyman present. Oh. Hey Daniel, would you say grace before we eat? Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. Okay, um- Heavenly Father, as we bow our heads- Hey, hey! Come on, I can't get no stains on this. Shana'll be mad. We get to eating, man. Forgive them, Father. They know not what they do. Look on the bright side, they treating you like one of the guys. Yeah, I guess. I'm glad you made it. So am I? That's so funny. Hey Monty? - Yeah? I was gonna be a banker, you know? - Were ya? - Yeah. Till this woman told me to check her balance and I pushed her over. Uh, hey guys, I gotta- I gotta head out, so. I'm just gonna leave. Okay. * There he is! Hey. Ah, I thought it would be cool to do some classes for the first dance. But Monty's kind of tapped out on wedding stuff so, would you be my partner? Oh Ange no, no, no. I'm not much of a dancer. Come on, please? It's part of the wedding package, right? Or was all that "I live to serve" stuff just bull? Okay, all right. 'Kay, so I'm gonna do some moves. All right. Try and follow along, okay? So it starts like this. One, two, three, pump the knee. Slide in place. Uh huh. All right, oh. What are we doing now? Okay. - I'm just gonna sit you here. Oh and now I'm sitting, all right. * Oh should we do things * We shouldn't we've planned * Let's take our time * Got you on my mind * Your passions aligned * Creative in lives * I crave every touch * Am I thinking too much * Reading me like * Poetry, I * Lost with you, I * Don't know what to do, I * Am in the clouds with you, I * See? Easy. Yeah, yeah, I'm always, uh, willing to lend a hand, get it? Always with the clever words. Why do I feel like they come from here and not from here? I'm just, uh, worried about saying the wrong thing. And what would you do if you weren't afraid? That was a mistake, I'm sorry. What do you want Daniel? Are you trying to be a saint? I was trying not to be a sinner. You talk a lot about love but you're missing one key ingredient: Guts. What am I doing? What am I doing? What am I doing? Lord, I'm desperate. Talk to me. Okay, come on, come on, come on. All right here! "Bring me a three-year-old heifer, "a she-goat, a ram, a turtle dove "and a baby pigeon." No no no, that's not right. That's not right. All right. "As he walked down the road, some boys from town teased him "yelling 'Get outta here, baldy!' "So he cursed the boys "and two bears came out of the woods and mauled them." Nope, not that either. Come on! Okay. "If a man commits adultery with his neighbours betrothed, "both offenders must be put to death"? All right, this is a bad idea. Lord, give me a sign, please. That was quick. Pastor Daniel. Wrong sign. Mr. Fassbeck, how can I help? Yeah, you love to help. You can start by dropping the goody-goody act. I'm on to you, Pastor. And she's marrying me. Okay, Mr. On and off-again Monty, why are you marrying her in the first place? I'm ready, it's time. That's real romantic, "Big Dawg". Why are you marrying Angela? Her father is dying. She's going through the worst time in her life. I'm doing this for her and you're making things worse. So you're engaged to her 'cause you feel sorry for her? Never-mind, you don't marry somebody because it's good for them, you marry somebody because it's good for you too. Yeah, that's right. Mind your business! Or I'll make you turn the other cheek. What is this, fourth grade? Come on, hit me. No. You're no martyr, you're a wuss. You hide behind that collar 'cause you ain't got no spine. You see that's why guys like me end up with girls like Angela. And guys like you, end up friends. * * Go tell it on the mountain * Over the hills and everywhere * Go tell it on the mountain * That Jesus Christ is born * * Go tell it on the mountain * Over the hills and everywhere * Go tell it on the mountain * That Jesus Christ is born * * Go tell it on the mountain * Over the hills and everywhere * Go tell it on the mountain * That Jesus Christ is born * * That Jesus Christ is born * Go on girl, sing. Yes. Merry Christmas y'all. Merry Christmas y'all. Hope everybody got what they wanted under the tree this morning. Which kinda got me to thinking about giving gifts, you know. You reach a certain age where giving presents is more important than getting 'em. And I know it's not always about you but, uh, you know, if people didn't want things the whole system would kind of fall apart, you know? Which got me to thinking about Joseph 'cause he's kind of like the third wheel in this whole thing. And now in the supporting role of the dull and dutiful father: Saint Joseph. We're like, what did he want? Did he have a say? He has no more to do with the nativity than one of those plastic sheep you just stick in the back of the crèche. I'm sorry, I know I'm supposed to be this wise pastor and everything, but maybe I'm just a sheep too. Baah, baah, humbug, get it? Interesting sermon. Takes the merry right out of Christmas, doesn't it? Timothy, let's stick to the business you wanted to discuss. What, did I, uh, park in the wrong spot? Forget to bless the poinsettias? It's about the chalice that went missing. I understand the police brought in a suspect who- Not only did you not prosecute him, but you let him keep the chalice. Yeah, I gave him the candlesticks too. Why? I don't know, I read it in the book somewhere. Cavorting with criminals? Lunch dates with congregants? I heard you're giving some couple their own special wedding program. Yeah, it needs a new name. If you think of anything. This is not what we signed up for. This is grounds for dismissal. Thank you, Timothy. That'll be all. Hm. I'm still on you side. Talk to me. How did you and Hazel meet? Ah. Well, I was fresh out of divinity school and, uh, got a job as an Assistant Pastor. Hazel was the minister's daughter. Things got complicated, but it all worked out. 42 years and counting. And didn't you find it difficult being a man of the cloth? Well sure, but what isn't? Yeah. I'm trying to do the right thing and I'm trying to do the kind thing, and neither one feels right. There's kindness to be found everywhere. The thing is, it's better to be honest with words that sound kind than to be kind with words that sound honest. Talk to her, son. What if it's too late? It ain't over till the fat lady sings. Tell my wife I said that and I'm gonna break three of the Commandments on ya. Hey, it's, uh, me again. Just checking in. Big day tomorrow, yaay! Uh, so if you need me just- Mrs. Ramirez, what are you doing here? It's Christmas, go home. I know. I was worried about you. Well lately you have been so forconalsome scuptancious, and frankly, a little bit colaphalochamous. Where do you get these words Mrs. R? I make 'em up. Well are you telling me you don't feel forconalsome, scuptancious and colaphalochamous? I've never felt so colaphalochamous in my whole life. I thought so. So I, I made you this. A lion? Mrs. R, thank you. It is a symbol. You know that scene in the Bible where Daniel walks into that lion's den? - Mhm. - Yeah. So it's to remind me to be like that other Daniel? Strong and calm in the face- No, honey. You are the lion. Merry Christmas, Pastor Daniel. Yeah, Merry Christmas, Mrs. R. * * * * Still nothing. Maybe she's busy breaking up with Monty right now. Yeah, sure. Or maybe her phone got trampled on by some unicorns. Okay, I'll make you a bet. If she doesn't get married today, you have to go to church for three months. I'll go to church for three years, but that ain't gonna happen. She made a choice. - Has she? She's in her wedding dress right now. I need a drink. There's gotta be one around here somewhere. Don't you dare. Okay, let's see it on. Is this a mistake? I think it's better off. I'm not talking about the veil. I know. This is normal, right? These butterflies, more like a bag full of hornets. Momma, you felt this way, right? No. - Shana, please tell me you felt this way. No. You gotta do this for you. Not for me, not for Pops. Do you love him? Which one? The one who asked me or the one who won't? You have got to- It's time! Hey, Pastor Daniel! Must be a hard day for ya, huh? No Sampson knocking down the temple. No David slaying Goliath. No Joshua sacking Jerusalem. Jericho. You lost. Sorry, Pastor. Today the lion eats Daniel. * * Be seated. So, uh, we are gathered here today to join Angela and Monty in holy matrimony. In the words of John, Chapter 14, "God is love, and those who abide in love, abide in God," blah, blah, blah, et cetera, et cetera. Let's talk a little bit about Monty, shall we? You know what? Let's talk about Angela. The most incredible person I've ever met y'all. Smart as a whip, left her big fancy city job to work in the charity, I mean, who does that these days? She is the kindest, smartest, most beautiful- Daniel. - Yeah? This is not a part of the program. Well it should be. Uh, the program. Yeah, let's stick to the program Steve Stickler. Can I get some water please? I'm getting a little hot. I got you! Darryl, what are you doing? Sorry, baby. The best. Mmmm. Ahhh! Okay. So let's, uh, let's go on to the rings then. Come on, baby girl, what's your? Thank you. Wait, where's the, is the ring? Ah... Well, I'm sorry y'all, there's no rings and if you don't have the rings, you don't got no wedding things so, uh- Uh, never-mind. We found it, great. So I guess we're gonna move right along, uh- Does anybody here, have any reason why these two should not be bound together in holy matrimony for the rest of their lives? Anybody y'all. Any reason at al- It doesn't even have to be a big reason. It can just, it can be a little itty bitty reason. Oh yes, you in the back! Oh no, you're just itching your head? Okay. Daniel. - Yeah? Okay, I guess y'all wanna get married. So I guess, by the powers vested in me, I, um- I, uh- I, uh- I, uh- I object. What? I knew it. Oh good lord. Holy. Yeah, baby! Angela I'm in love with you and I think you're in love with me too. And I'll do anything for you except let you marry this guy- What are you doing? This is my wedding! Angela? Angie! - Angela? - Angela? I knew it. Angela! Angela! Aaaaaaahhhh! Let go of him! - Get off of me! You ruined my life! Stop! She's mine! We're in a church! Man, come on! This is the last straw. I am taking this to the board. Son, is what you meant by Michael Jordan? Oh Daniel. Smile. Mmm mmm mmm mmm. Thanks, man. Hey, on the bright side, you got me to go to church for three years. I'm proud of you. And I know it's brutal but, you're a better man because of it and that'll make you a better preacher. Preacher? No, my career is over. The Reeds must be furious. Most of all, Angela. Wherever she is. Yeah, she'll be all right. She's not a little girl. And you? Have a little faith, Brother Daniel. I do. Yeah. Can I help you? I uh, I-I-I borrowed these from-from the other guy. He said I could keep 'em but, uh- I don't need 'em, so... Thank you. Could-could you tell him thanks. I-I guess it worked for me. It worked? What worked? My soul. It's good. So am I. Well good. - Yeah. Happy New Year, padre. Happy New Year to you too. Hey. Well, well, well. Look who showed up. I figured if she was still in the State, she'd be at her favourite place. Do you know where I'm supposed to be right now? At my wedding reception. Yeah, about that. - With my husband. May I sit down? Please? Well it seems like lately you've been doing whatever you damn well please, so. I mean, I did promise you, it'd be an unforgettable day, remember? Too soon? For someone so smart, you say the dumbest things. Yeah, I really stepped in it today, huh? Why did you wait so long, Daniel? If you had spoken up a month ago, things would have been different. I know, I know. But I let my head get in the way of my heart and that messed up what came out of my mouth. You gotta work on that. But today, you know, once I let it out, I felt free! You know, no more stress and no more worrying about, about saying the wrong thing. Oh, so you're a changed man now, huh? Swear to god. All right. So were are you really into Jan or were you just trying to make me jealous? B. Did you hit Monty on purpose? Hundred percent. Do you believe in signs? From God? Angela, I believe you're a sign from God. I'm crazy in love with you, clearly. And every time we're together, it feels perfect, you know. It feels like it's meant to be. It's funny 'cause I thought if he showed up, maybe it's meant to be. Really? What about Monty? He's a nice guy but, and he's trying to do the right thing, but you can't get married for other people. So you guys are... Off again. For the last time. Then I have a question and this is gonna feel a little sudden but- You know, we've been spending so much time together and I feel so close to you, I feel like I can tell you anything. And you're a big fan of me, right? Exactly. Angela Reed, will you marry me? Finally! Is that a yes? I do. * Uh oh. Daniel English, I have consulted the others, including the board of directors and Mr. Reed here, and we've decided to officially offer you the position of permanent Pastor. What about Deacon Jones? He's, uh, taking a vacation, bless his heart. You still want the gig? He does. We do. Wait, we? Yeah, we have a little announcement. Atta-boy, Daniel. I guess we can retire after all. Ohh, amen to that. Darryl? Yeah baby? I love you, baby. You know that don't you? Yeah baby. Looks like we've got another wedding to plan. Yeah, well good thing I know what you like. Well not everything. * Ohh, I love you baby, mmm * Just thinking about you makes my heart, mmm mmm mmm * *
