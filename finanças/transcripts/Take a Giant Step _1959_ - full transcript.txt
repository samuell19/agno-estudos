Well, where have you been? I'm an hour late for my other job. Who told you to wait? Why don't you just go? And leave your grandma alone, huh? Your momma would have my head. Well, I'm here now, so you can go. Boy, you're in a charming mood. What's the matter, sugar? Nothing. Well, I got no time to prove. Another thing Spence, your room is a mess. I know I'm paid to clean it, but that's a Federal Works project. Very funny. What's the matter, sugar? Having a fight with your girlfriend? You know damn well I got no girlfriend, Christine. I know, that's what surprises me. A charming, good-looking boy like you. And such a lovely disposition. Why don't you do me a favor? Why don't you just drop dead? You know, Spence, I'd do anything in the world for you, and I'll give you a suggestion, a line of thought. Hustle on, Sugar. Whatever it is, I hope you feel better tomorrow. And? Is that no-good broom bush out of sight? Hey Gram! You know you've got no business coming downstairs. Mom told you to stay up here. Not only am I going to tell her, but when the doctor comes I'm going to tell him too. If you do, I'll tell your mother that you were late coming home from school. And that you have not practiced yet. You better put your concentration on getting down these steps, or you're going to fall and break your behind. Now you stop that kind of language, you hear me? I never thought I'd live to see the day that my own daughter's child would treat me like that. I have not said anything yet Gram, I only said that if you were not careful, you were going to fall and break your behind. And you will, too. Take your hands off me. I can do the rest myself. Well do it, then! What are you doing with that old dirty thing in the house? What's wrong with you? Nothing! Well you act like there's something wrong. Come on over and talk to me. Talk to yourself! You've been doing it for years. You're a mean little bigot. Yeah, I know. What is the matter with you? I guess I might as well tell you. It's probably all over town, anyway. Look Gram, what could you possibly imagine as being about the worst thing that could happen to me? You have not gotten little girls in trouble, have you? Oh, nothing like that Gram! Worst! What have you done? Well I just got my behind kicked out of school, that's what! Spencer Scott! What were you doing? Nothing, just smoking in the john. Smoking where? In the john, the can, the men's room, Gram! What were you smoking? A cigar. Cigarettes are not dirty enough, I suppose? You have got to start smoking cigars! Will you stop hitting yourself with that thing? Will you leave me alone? You got to understand that when a guy is upset, he's got to hit himself with something, Gram. You just got to do something like that! Spence, when you are unhappy, I'm unhappy too. No matter how well I feel. Well, today in history class, we started talking about the Civil War. And this Laura Burkin, just to needle me now, wanted to know why the Negroes in the South had to wait for the Northeners to come down and help them. And the teacher, Miss Bailey, went on to explain how they were so... well, backwards! Anyway Gram, when she finished talking they sounded like the worst morons that ever lived! And I began to wonder how they managed to live in Africa a few thousand years, all by themselves with nobody's help! I would have let it pass, see, except the whole class was giggling and turning around, looking at me. So I just got up, stood next to my desk, and I looked at her. She looked at me for a couple minutes and asked me if I had something to say in the discussion. I said I might have a lot of things to say in this discussion if I didn't have to say them in the company of such dumb jerks! And I asked her, I said"what about the uprising of the slaves during the Civil War? And what about Frederick Douglass?" "That's beside the point, young man." Well in that case, I said, I don't want to be in your crummy history class, and went right out of the room! Oh Spence, you didn't! I most certainly did. Spence, I hardly know what to believe, you exaggerate so. Well, even allowing for a little exaggeration, Gram, that's what happened. Well, after that story, I could use a glass of beer. The doc told you not to! I'm going to tell mom, Gram. You're in no position to tell anybody anything. Well give it here. You think the folks will go for the story, Gram? I'm not sure. You mean they are not going to go for it at all. I mean that you're going to get what you rightfully deserve. Well that's a nasty thing to say, considering the fact I was justified! Well, there's way and ways of being justified! You mean I should not have gotten sassy with that fruitcake! I'm not going to say another word to you today if you keep using language like that! For crying out loud! You're going to be a crum, just like the rest of the crummy world. Listen, are you my friend or not, Gram? No, I'm not. Not when you talk like that! Well, thanks a lot. You're a real good Joe. You're a song singer, just like the rest of them. Love me when I'm good, hate me when I'm bad. Well, thanks a lot, Gram! Don't mention it! You're welcome. The pleasure was all mine. You know, for an old lady, you sure can be plenty sarcastic when you want to be. Queen Sarcastia of Poopsville U.S.A. These will be the last words that I'll say to you today, Master Scott. Hi Spence! Well, well, well. If it isn't the three musketeers. Hi Spence. Hi Mrs. Scott. Gussie, ever since you could talk, I've told you that I'm not Mrs. Scott. I'm Mrs. Martin. How long do I have to keep telling you this? Well, I forgot Mrs. Martin. Yeah, you seem to forget a lot of things, don't you? Like sticking up for a friend when he's being chewed up by his teacher! Now what could we say? Exactly what you did... Nothing! Oh, it was fine. What did I call you, pals? Well that's exactly what you are. 200-karat solid gold plate pals. And another thing, I don't know, maybe I'm getting deaf or something, but I don't hear you guys calling for school anymore in the morning. Ah, Spence! You know good and well I take Marguerite to school in the mornings. Oh yeah, and where do you take her at night when you pass my house with her curled around your arm like a snake. We're doing our homework together. It's a little dark in the park for homework. Cut it out Spence, your grandmother. My grandmother knows what the score is, she's been on the score and awful long time now. She's going on 83 years old, so you can talk freely in front of her. Alright, it isn't Marguerite's fault, I told you before that she likes you. It's her father. Well, Mr. Wendowski, well he... He doesn't like colored people. I'm sorry Mrs. Martin, but that's the lousy truth. Spence, he just doesn't like him. And I don't like Polish people either. Never have and I never will. Sometimes I think Hitler was right. Oh, cut it out Gram! You know he wasn't right, now why did you have to go and say that for? I don't care. I don't like them, I never have, and I never will. Listen, will you quit mixing up things you don't understand? Please! Alright fellas, why'd you come over for? What do you want? Well, tomorrow is Saturday. We're getting up a ball game and... And you want me to pitch for you, huh? Well what happens after the ball game? Tomorrow, I mean. Well there's going to be a gathering at Marguerite's. Gathering? It's going to be a real wingding. Who are you taking, Gussie? Oh, I thought I would give Marie-Evelyn a buzz... and... Oh, I see. So I'm not invited, uh? Well, no thanks. If I'm not good enough for the little gathering, then I'm not good enough to pitch for you! Anyway, Marguerite's father might not like that either. And another thing, if I could not do any better than that Marguerite Wendowski and her old man, I'd join the foreign legion. Somebody, someday is going to take a poke at you, Spence. If he hits you Spence, hit him right back! He is not going to hit anybody, Gram. Now get out of my house before I beat you and your whole team over the head. Get out of my house and don't ever come back! You mean that? Yeah, I mean it! I just don't get you, Spence. Just get out of here, will you? Well, goodbye Mrs. Scott. Martin! Martin! Martin! I just went and did it again, Gram. I didn't want them to know how much they hurt me. Spence, let's you and I look at a little television. Sometimes, Gram, you can get the most disgusting ideas! You're no fun to be with anymore! You won't even look at a little television with me! Go and look at television! Spend the rest of your life with your head stuck in front of an old light bulb. What do I care? Spence, go get a hairbrush, you head could stand a good brushing. Spence, you don't suppose you could go back up to school? And tell them that you were eating a chocolate cigar, could you? No, Gram. That wouldn't do. One dumb crummy girl at school the other day wanted to know if we had to comb and brush our hair. What did you tell her? I told her we sailed unbothered until the bugs got so fierce they started falling into our food and it was an absolute necessity. Spence, you didn't! No, I didn't. But I would have, if I thought of it in time. We haven't done this in a long time, have we? What? Don't you remember when you were a little boy I used to brush and comb your hair every day. You used to stand much shorter than you are now. I would brush and comb your hair... I used to do this for all my boys. They would sit and tell me all their troubles. And I brushed and combed their hair. Now, now... Don't cry. Everything is going to be alright. No it's not, Gram. Won't you see, Gram, that I'm an outcast? How? Fellas don't want me around anymore, I'm cramped with the broads. Why? That's a stupid question, because I'm black! That's why. Maybe it's a good thing they don't want you around. I told your mother years and years ago, May, stay out of the South end! There's nothing down there but Wops and Polacks... Oh, cut it out, Gram. Sometimes you're of no help at all. I tell you my troubles and you come telling me how we shouldn't have moved down here in the first place. But we are here, Gram, right here, and I was born here, and they're the only friends I've got. Makes me pretty unhappy, too. We'll think of something, Spence. We'll think of something. Come on, you better go upstairs. You look tired. Yes I am tired. And when I'm tired, I like to look tired. I'm no hypocrite. Besides, you don't want Mom to catch you down here. That's right. Hey, look Gram, you don't suppose you could lend me five dollars, could you? What do you want that much money for? Well you and I both know, Gram, in about an hour from now I'm going to be about the smallest thing crawling on two legs. The old lady should let me have it. You must not talk about your mother that way. Well, she is... When Pop gets home, he's going to cuss me out and say I'm no son of his, no good. Well he's sure going to call me a no-goodin' bastard. For a starter. Well after old Hasbrook gave me the evil, Gram, I went by the bank to talk to Pop. And I lost my nerve. I don't know Gram, I can't seem to get through Pop, we don't play on the same team or something. He means well, but he just doesn't have the equipment. Well, you see Gram if you could lend me $5 I could get mom some flowers and... Well maybe get Pop a cigar. And begin by telling him how sorry I am. It might take the edge of things, Gram. What do you say? Just wait a minute. Catch. Thanks, Gram. You're a real pal. Is that you, May? Yes mother, how do you feel? I'm alive! How did things go down at Red Cross? Routine. Did you take your 5 o'clock pill? Yes I did. When? Four o'clock. I love it so, I just couldn't wait! Doggone it, I have Fridays! Fridays are always murder at the bank! The line at my window was a block long! Is JP Morgan home already? What's new with the bank teller? Now she isn't supposed to be up yet. That means I'm going to be heckled all night. On Friday night, of all nights! After a miserable day at the bank. Well, what's Moby Dick bellyaching about now? Mama! Is Spence home yet? Isn't he home yet? Mother, did Spence get home from school? I'm sorry, I can't hear a word you're saying. I hope he isn't horsing around some place. He ought to be studying for those midterms. Now don't worry about Spence, he will do as good as anybody else. As good as anybody else is not good enough. Our boy has got to be better than anybody else in order to wind up being as good as anybody else, if you get what I mean. Well, it's in English, that's all I can say for him. Mama, I thought you couldn't hear a thing. You take me down at the bank, I have to be twice as good as the guy in the next window, just to hold my job. If I hear another word about that rabid bank, I'll blow it up! If she does not stop heck... Hello? This is Mr. Scott speaking. Oh, hello Mr. Hasbrook. How are you? How's everything down at Southend High? Oh... You want to talk to me about who? About Spence? Spence? Oh, hi Alan. I was on my way over to your house. I finished my homework early so I thought... Well that's disgusting! You got a whole weekend ahead of you, why did you have to finish your homework so soon? Now look, if I want to get my homework done, that's my business. I don't tell you it?s disgusting when you don?t get yours done at all, do I? I'm sorry Alan. You were on your way over to my house, for what? I just wanted to tell that when you lead into that witch in history class, I felt like applauding. Gee, I guess if I got kicked out of school, I guess I would just as soon drop dead, right there on the floor in the principal's office. Look Alan, you don't have to rub it in, I get the message. Alright? I'm sorry, Spence. Look, is there anything I can do? What in the name of Ulysses S. Grant could you do about it? So let's forget it! Look, I didn't mean that business about dropping dead. I probably wouldn?t drop dead, anyway. There is nothing wrong with my heart. Will you please cut it out, Alan? You talk too much. I've hurt your feelings, haven't I? I'm sorry, Alan. I've always liked you, Alan. Even if nobody else does. I mean, you're a real good Joe, Alan, and I'm apologizing. It's OK, Spence. I know you're upset. What are you going to do about Ms. Bailey? Apologize? Now listen, I just finished apologizing to you. And that's enough apologizing for one day. Besides... what do I care if I go back to school or not, anyway. I'm on my way to meet my girlfriend. Girlfriend? Who's the girl, Spence? Just a girl, that's all. Well, here comes my bus, Alan. Hey, I want a glass of beer. Here? Yeah. How old are you? Did you ask him how old he was? No I didn't. Then why are you asking me? I happen to be 21. When is your birthday? Hurry up, spit it out. Come on kid, get out! Out! Hey Frank, will you shut up? I can't hear a word! Oh, shut up! What did you just say to me? I said shut up, now shut up! And give me a dime for that phone! Now listen Frank, don't you be jumping salty with me. Oh cut it out! Will you get back on the phone? If we don't raise money for the rent, we will be on the street tomorrow. And he's your dime! Oh shut up, I can't hear a word! Do you remember the time you took Violet down to New York and registered in that hotel as Mr. and Mrs.? Well to get down to New York, you had to cross a state line. Have you ever heard of the Mann Act? Well Violet has. All Violet is asking for is ten dollars and she wants it tonight at Carter's drugstore or else the FBI, have you got all that, sugar? Fine. We'll be looking for you here, in ten minutes. You're coming in here, blackmailing somebody on my telephone. Oh, we aren't blackmailing anybody, we are just keeping ourselves available. There's not telling next week sometime one of those boys might be glad we are still here. I can't see why! Why don't you shut up? This is supposed to be a place of business. Gentlemen come in for a nice quiet drink. And not for a bunch of floozie splaying the jukebox. Mister, don't you be calling us no floozies here. I'm liable to come over there and snatch you breathless. Come on Poppy, don't pay no attention to him. Coming in here for a quiet drink, he calls. I've seen you lamping that little girl over there. And you too, buster, for that matter. Come on darling, get your telephone book out, we don't have all night. Well, I don't know why we don't have all night, we don't have anything else to do. Well, have we? No, we haven't, stupid. But you don't have to say it here, do you? We have to keep up some pretenses, Poppy. Hey Frank! What? Bring over another bottle of ginger ale. What do you want in it? We have our own whiskey, thank you. It will cost you 15 cents a bottle. And don't come in here with food, this is no lousy picnic ground! Well, it's lousy. Well ice will cost you a dime! Well bring it on over, you chinchy skunk. Calling me names like this, you can come right over here and get it for yourself. Can I help you pal? Oh yeah, I want a glass of beer, please. Well what's so funny, I asked you for a glass of beer. Quick, when were you born? January 20th, 1938. OK, that makes you 21. We got special-owned whiskey today. You know hot shot, you got remarkable powers of persuasion, but I asked you for a glass of beer, if you don't mind. That's right, sugar. Don't you drink none of that man's whiskey. He fermented itself. You're right Frank, that must be special... Specially off! Ah, shut up! Sugar, why don't you come over here and sit with us? Sure. Yeah, baby. Welcome to our home. Away from home. The Interpretation of Dreams by Sigmund Freud. You believe in this stuff? Freud. I don't know, it's just require dreading in our psychology class. Does it say anything in this book about umbrellas? I keep having the lousiest dreams about umbrellas. I don't know, I just skim through it. Mind if I take a look? No, go ahead. Say, do any of you girls know the young lady sitting over there? No, we don't know her at all. She's a mousy little thing, ain't she? No, I don't think she's mousy at all. I can't find a thing in this book about umbrellas. This is the lousiest dream book I ever saw. Let me find it for you. Let's get to work, or we will never raise the rent money. Hey Rose, you call Homer. His number is main 28927. And here's the dime. Hey, did you say canes or umbrellas. Umbrellas, sugar. Ain't much difference between canes and umbrellas. Is there? What does it say about canes? It doesn't say much. It just says here that a woman dreams about a man with a cane. Must mean you're pretty bad, because they have her whole life described up here. I didn't say I dreamed about canes, did I? I said umbrellas. Don't be trying to push her dreams off on me. Don't be looking at those crazy people's dreams either. Go find some nice personal dreams about umbrellas. Hello, Homer? This is Rose. Well I know an awful lot of Homers too, but I know which one you are! Rose Thompson. How have you been? I haven't seen you in a month of Sundays. Wouldn't that be a heck of a month with only Sundays in it? Just spend the rest of your life in church! Shut up. Well, I was calling you because we're in a jam. Violet, Poppy and me! Yeah, the three flowers. Well, we need some money for the rent. I don't know... I guess everybody is just trying to save with Christmas coming and all, they're cutting down on the little luxuries. Oh, Homer! You say the most terrible things. The son of a... Well how about it? Well... I guess we're going to have to talk to your wife. No, no, I don't talk to her tonight. You wouldn't! Well just thanks for nothing, Homer! The same to you! Can it! Can you beat that? He said he couldn't care less whether his wife knew or not. You know, there's something terribly immoral about that. Right, nobody has respect for marriage these days. I just wish somebody would ask me to marry them. I'd split their head wide open. Excuse me, but are you girls prostitutes or something? Well, honey. We try to be. Oh yeah? Hey, I have never met any real prostitutes before. Mind if I ask you a couple of questions? Well, baby. Right now we're in a little hot water. We also got to meet a certain Sidney at Carter's drugstore. But as soon as we get back, we'll answer all your questions. Come on girls. Well I don't see why we all have to go get a little $10 from Sidney. Because in union there is strength. Now come out of that chair and let's go! Yeah? Well, I think I'll have one of your specials now. You mean whiskey? Well, what's the matter? You got a new name for it? Alright, buster. Take it easy. I'll have another one. Mind if I sit down? You're sure I'm not bothering you or anything? Because if I am, I can get the heck out and go someplace else. You know... These tables aren't reserved, you can sit anywhere you please. If you bother me, I can get up and get the hell out of here. That's all... Sorry... Where are you going? You don't want me here... Sit down, kid. I didn't mean to scare you away. I guess a nice girl like you does have to be careful who she talks to in a joint like this. But you don't need to be afraid of me though. What makes you think I'm such a nice girl? I can just tell, that's all. What makes you think I'm not like Violet, Rose and Poppy? Ah, come on. Quit your kidding. Well thanks for thinking I'm different from Violet, Rose and Poppy. Oh, you are. Aren't you? Yeah. In all due respect, I guess I am. I thought so. My name is Spencer Scott. But everybody calls me Spence. Hello, Spence. You're not really 21, are you? I was lying then. You see, I have to lie about my age until I get to be 21. But when I get to be 21, not another lie gets past my lips. That's very sweet. No, I really honestly mean it. I really honestly believe you. You'd never believe it from looking at me, but you're looking at one of the friendless persons in the United States. Ah, come on. Well, I guess that wasn?t exactly the truth... You see, I've got my Gram. She's the only friend I've got! I guess... Have you got a match, kid? Thanks. So... What makes you think you're so friendless? For a while I thought maybe it was me. Maybe my personality wasn't so hot or something... You know? See... I'm a real guy. Like I saw you in the window there and thought I'd give it a whirl. Thanks. For seeing me in the window. I know you think it sounds pretty silly, because... Well I know how girls are about going around with boys younger than they are. But have you gotten a really good look at the Kinsey Report lately? No. I'm afraid I'm not quite the reader that you are. Well, I'm honestly not one to boast, but... Well it says in that book that boys my age are usually pretty sexy. In fact, they are sexier at my age than they ever will be again in their whole lives. So, what with my other qualifications, I should be a pretty good boy for one to have around. You know, I can imagine that that's the truth. Look, I want you to know that if everything works out alright and we decide we love each other... well I'm perfectly willing to get married. My father wants me to go to college. But I'd be willing to fore go that if everything works out alright. What do you say, uh? Spence, that was about the sweetest proposal that I've ever had. Is something wrong? No... Too much beer, I guess. You know what you ought to do? You ought to go on home and let your grandmother give you a great, big kiss and tuck you in. No, you don't understand. I won't be going home. I packed my bag and everything. I have to get a job. What do you say, uh? I already told you what I say. Go on home. And talk about getting a job. What in the name of heaven could you do? You couldn't do anymore than my husband. Your husband? Yeah. He works all day, then he works all night. We still have nothing. He is what is commonly known as unskilled labor. And I guess you know what that means. I'm sorry, kid. You should have told me you were married in the first place. I feel like a great big can of garbage. I've got to go now. Where are you going? See that man over there? Well, he's been staring at me all evening. And I hope he has some money, and I hope he has a car. A nice car, with a top that goes down. And we can go for a drive in the country. Maybe for an hour or two. We could have some fun. I think that's terrible. So do I. Well that makes two of us. And if my husband ever found out... I guess he would kill me. So that makes three of us. But I can't go back to that lousy one-room flat and wait all night. It's too quiet there. Nobody to talk to. It's just no fun, that's all. Well if you're going, why don't you go? It's funny how when you're young, you can be so selfish about your feelings. Isn't it? Thank you for the proposal. Please, don't be sore. I tried to help. Spence, there's a little rhyme I used to know as a kid. It goes: Merry have we met, merry have we been, merry let us part and merry meet again. Let's not part angerly, uh? Spence? Good luck, kid. Please, go on home. Don't worry about him. Tomorrow on his way to work I'll catch him. He'll cough up that ten bucks or I'll snatch him bald-headed. Finding out a good business tonight. And I'm so hungry. You know, the way I see it, we might as well be dead. We should hum along to the graveyard and just lay down. Well, what are you doing out here? What does it look like I'm doing out here? Is there any lipstick on my mouth to speak of? What are you doing smearing lipstick on your face like that? Are you peculiar or something? Ah, cut the comedy! You remember that girl that was inside? Oh I get it, she kissed him. Yeah. Guess you might say I'm a pretty fast worker, uh? How would you like to come with me? Where are we going? Well you said you wanted to talk with me, didn't you? I thought we could go somewhere where we could be alone. A quiet place. What's the matter, honey? Too much to drink? Yeah, I guess so. Ah, well come on sugar. We can fix that in a flash. You got enough money to buy us a sandwich or something? Yeah, I got two dollars and 39 cents here. Well that sounds like the price of something in a fire sale doesn't it? Let's go. Well, Rose, face it. $2.39 is $2.39, and every little bit helps. Amen. I called the pizza place, the drugstore, and the bowling alley. He has not been in all evening. What about Tony's house? And Gussie's? I phoned them all. They haven't seen him. Then where the devil is he! I don't know Daddy, I've told you that over and over again. And stop yelling. Do you want the neighbors to hear? Come on inside. Is that mother of yours asleep yet? Well I gave her a pill, that doesn't seem to mean much. I think that she knows more than she's letting on. Well there's a 500-Watt light down in the cellar why don't you bring it up along with your rubber hose and give her the third degree? Look, why don't you stop trying to be so smart? That's the trouble with your whole family. They think they're smart. Why don't you read your paper, Daddy, and watch television for a while? If I get my hand son that little bastard I'll break every bone in his body. Now that's no way to talk, Daddy. It most certainly is not. It's disgraceful! Mama will you please keep out of it? The truth is the truth and should be spoken at all time. Mother, please! Don't "Mother, please" me! The truth is the truth, it is disgraceful! Will you please tell her to stay out of it? Mother, please! Well speak up to him and don't let him get away with that talk! I'd speak up, Mama, if you'd give me half a chance. Calling your husband Daddy, that's the silliest thing I ever heard! Mama if you don't keep out of this, I'll come upstairs and give you a pill and shut your door. And I'll spit out the pill and open the door, so there! Will you two please stop bickering, so we can get to the point at hand! Do you know where he is? Hey old lady! I'm talking to you. Well if you're talking to me, my name is Mrs. Martin. And I would thank you to remember that. No, I don't know where he is. And if I did, I wouldn't tell you! Would you tell me, Mama? Tell you? After you telling me to shut up? I wouldn't tell you a thing! I didn't tell you to shut up, Mama. Well you said "Mother, please!" Same thing. There is no use talking to her, she is stubborn as an old mule. I heard that, and I'll remember it. Well, what now? Do you suppose we should call the police? For what? We have not done anything, have we? They could help us find him. Look, there will be no police in this house ever! For any reason. Now you're being silly. You heard what I said. There will be no police in this house. Come on in! Hey, what's that? It's the man next door. Don't worry about them, they're deaf. Sounded like they were in here. Well, they're not. They're in the next room. The walls here are real thin. Thin is hardly the word for it. I'd say they were put together with spitballs. Hey, I thought you said we were going to a restaurant so we could talk. Well it's more comfy to talk here. We can have something sent in if we wanted. Don't you want to take your jacket off? It's kind of warm in here. Yeah, I guess I will. Well you don't mind if I change to something more comfortable, would you? No. Be a minute. You got anything to eat around here? I'm a little groggy. I think it's because I haven't had anything to eat all day. There's some crackers in the cabinet. You got any cheese to go with these crackers? Look around and see! I can't find any. I guess Poppy must have took it for the trap. Now. How do I look? Do you honestly feel more comfortable in that thing? Much, much more. Now come on, let's sit down over here so we can... talk. I should think it would tickle the back of your neck something awful. What are we going to talk about? I thought you wanted to talk to me. There crackers don't seem to be doing a bit of good. Come on closer. I can hear you from here. Come on sugar, stop being so bashful. I'm not being bashful. Oh, come on. Alright, alright. You don't have to pull on me. Now, tell Violet all about it. All about what? Well, what's troubling you, baby? Nothing is troubling me. Well suppose you give Violet a little kiss, that will make you feel better. I honestly don't see how a kiss is going to help my hunger. Well, try it baby and see. Oh, come on, sugar! You can do better than that. You know what? No, what? I left my book at the bar. Well, let it stay there. Nobody is going to run away with it. Well how can you be so sure of that? Listen, sugar. Nobody that goes in Frank?s ever reads nothing. Just take my word for it. Well I better go anyway. Are you trying to run out on me? No, why would I want to... Well it sure isn?t what it looks like... What about all these questions you wanted to ask me? What happened to all that big talk you were throwing around at the bar? Well nothing happened. I got a headache. I'm hungry. At least, I think I'm hungry. Well I think you're just plain scared. Say, how old are you anyway? I told you, I'm 21. If you're 21, I'm sweet 16. Come over here. You have never been in a place like this before, have you? No. Kind of scared, aren't you? Yeah, I guess I am a little scared. I just what to go to the bar and get my book now if you don't mind. Look, kid. I most certainly do mind. Now let me tell you how this mess works. You took me out of circulation for roughly 15 minutes now. Well in 15 minutes, anything can happen. So if you think you're just going to put your coat on and walk out of here, you have another thought coming. I want my two dollars and 39 cents. That's all the money I have. I know that's all the money you have. You think if you had more, I'd be asking for $2.39? What do you take me for? Oh honey, it's not that I don't understand. It's just that business is business. Can I keep half a dollar for supper? You can take the crackers when you leave. I want my $2.39. Thank you. And another thing. If you tell anybody all you paid me was $2.39, I'll have your head on a platter, you hear me? I hear you. Can I go now? Help yourself. What's the matter, did you lose something? I wondered if you would do me a favor? If there's no money involved, I might. Well, there is. Will you let me have bus fare? I want to go home. That's what I get for fooling around with kids. You can just reach in and get bus fare. And only bus fare. What's the matter with you, anyway? Nothing, I just don't feel so good. Thanks for the dime. Don't bother thanking me, it hurts me to give it to you. Thanks, anyway. Just one thing I want you to know. What's that? Well that's the ugliest bathrobe I've ever seen in my whole life! He's coming down the street now. And he's carrying a bag. Well I'll be... Now don't holler at him until we find out where he's been. Spence, is that you? Yeah, it's me Gram. I've lost my glasses and can't seem to find them. Be right up. You'll sit down little man, I want to talk to you. It will take just a second. A second is too long! That traitor upstairs can wait for her glasses. You sit down! Spence? You don't look well. Where have you been? Spence? I haven't told them a thing! And if they say I have, they're lying. Look, will you shut her up! Mama, please! Oh, shut up yourself! Mother please, mother please. Why don't you just tell me to shut up and be done with it? Spence, I smell beer on your breath. Have you been drinking beer? Yeah, right after two shots of whiskey. Well I'll be damned. Now, Daddy. Please! Don't be calling that man Daddy! He's no husband of mine! Who have you been drinking beer with, Spence? I'd rather not say, Mom. Why not? Because you wouldn't know, anyway. I'd still like to know. Look, Mom. I'm trying to be honest with you. If you keep asking me, I'm going to start lying. I'd rather not lie about it, now. And don't think we don't know you were kicked out of school today. Well, goodie for you, Pop. You better talk to this little bum, May. Before I break his neck. There he goes again, it's disgraceful. Do you know what you did that was wrong? I didn't do anything that was wrong, Mom. Then that settles it, he was kicked out of school for just doing nothing. I didn't mean I didn't do anything, Pop. I just thought I was justified, that's all. He was justified. We got a genius on our hands, May. He knows more than the teacher. Where did you get that cigar? Out of your box. There you go. In other words, you have been stealing your father's cigars? I wouldn't exactly call it that, Mom. Well that's damn well what I'd call it! Your father, Spence, will go up to the school with you on Monday. You will apologize to Miss Bailey and be reinstated in school. I'm sorry Mom, I can't see my way into doing that. You mean you are going to disobey both your father and me. I'm not going to disobey either of you, Mom. I just thought you would be on my side, that's all. You're going to do as you're told! Alright, you can make me go up there, but I'm not going to apologize to anyone! Stop talking back to your mother! I'm not talking back to her, I just wanted her to understand how I feel, that's all. We don't care how you feel, now what do you think of that? You talk about what you will do and what you won't do. We do things we don't want to do every day of our lives! I hear those crumbs down at the bank talking about niggers, making jokes about niggers, but I stay on because I need the job! So that I can get the things that you need. What do you do? You get your silly little behind kicked out of school and now you're too proud to go back! Will you listen to that man running his big mouth! We have never been so humiliated. All the neighbors are talking. I'm sorry about that, Mom. You're not sorry at all. If you were, you would have prevented it. We have made every effort to see that you were raised in a decent neighborhood. And what is more, you have never been denied anything, Spence. We didn't want you to live in slums, because we always wanted the best for you. And you have no business talking back to white women no matter what they say or what they do. If you were in the South, you could be lynched for that. And your father and I could not do anything about it. So from now on, my advice to you is try and remember your place! You'll pardon me for saying so Mama, but that's the biggest hunk of bull I've ever heard in my entire life! What the hell is that you said? You both ought to be ashamed to talk to me that way. You get the hell on upstairs! Don't you come down here until you want to apologize to both of us. Go on! Alright, Pop, I'll go upstairs because you're my father and I still have to do what you tell me to. But I'm still ashamed of you and I want you both to know it. And you go straight to your room! Don't you go by stopping in that traitor's room! Who's to stop him I'd like to know? I will! If you come in my room with that nasty mouth of yours I'll slap every tooth down your throat. It's a fine state of affairs when a man can't have a little bit of respect in his own home! What has either of you done to get respect? I'd like to know. Nothing but bully the boy! Alright now Mother, you stay out of it. I'll not be part of it. If I have something to say, I'll say it and you know it. So don't try to hush me up! Mother, if you come down these stairs, I'm going to tell the doctor. Oh, tell him! Knock me down and sell me! Don't you think I care? All this slapping going on. Mother, please! Let her run herself down. Won't take long. That's where you're wrong. I have no intentions of running down. I have a few things to say and I'm going to say them. Go ahead and say it, and get it over with. I will. Don't you worry about that. Now, in the first place. That nasty little woman that teaches history up at that school, deserves exactly what she got. The only thing I think is that Spencer didn't tell her enough. He can't go around talking to people like that. Well that's a lot of bull and you know it. Now in a second place, when you moved down here did you ever stop to take into consideration that something like that was bound to happen sooner or later? And that the most important thing might have been just your love and comfort? Ha, you did not. And right on working. Instead of your company, he has a book... a bicycle, an electric train! Well the stuff that came in this house was ridiculous! That's not of your business. Will you let me finish? I don't go along with that way of raising one way or the other! Allow me to be the first to tell you both. Do you know that that boy is absolutely alone? He doesn't have a friend in the world! You didn't know, did you? All his little pals are taken up with the girls! And the little girls' mothers don't want their daughters going around with a colored boy! Well whether you knew it or not, he's alone! Now you want him forsaken completely by not backing him up! You moved him out of the slums! Taught him to think of himself as something to be respected. And now you get mad because he does the very thing that you made it possible for him to do! That bull, as he called it, about staying in his place. Well I'm ashamed of both of you and I want you to know it. I said what I came down to say. Now help me out of this couch. Well don't sit there like a dummy, come help me! You didn't have to come downstairs, Mama, you know that. I come downstairs when I want to. And what do you think of that? How about you two? You're too careful. I'm an old woman, I don't have much long to live one way or the other. So I come downstairs when I want to. Mama? Did Spence tell you all this? Well I certainly didn't hear it by talking to the neighbors. Why didn't he say so when we were talking with him? How could he? You both attacked him just like a rattlesnake the minute he got in the door. We did not. You did so! And I think you ought to apologize to him. Don't be a crime all your life! Why didn't you tell me all this was going on, May? Because I didn't know, Daddy. Well it's a mother's business to know what's happening to her son, isn't it? You know, I didn't know how it would take place but I knew it would turn out to be my fault. Oh well, I didn't mean... Oh, shut up. What's that you said to me? I said shut up. I told you not to hop on him the minute he came in the house. Maybe if you'd ask him questions instead of calling him names we would've found this all out, and you wouldn't have to stand there looking so foolish now. You were just as bad as I was! Spence is hungry. I am going to the kitchen to warm his food. You go upstairs and talk to him. Now go! Spence. Yes, Pop. We're going to have a little talk. Sit down, son. Are you comfortable? Yeah, Pop. I'm comfortable. How do you feel? I feel alright, Pop. A little groggy from all the stuff I've been drinking, I'll be alright. Well, that serves you right. You have to stop going around doing all these things. You hear? Yeah, Pop. I hear. Alright. Another thing, you have to stop talking back to me. One thing that makes me goodin' mad is talking back. I can't stand it and I won't stand it. Don't forget proper respect. You understand? Yeah, Pop. I understand. Alright. You're going to college, you know that don't you? Yes, Pop. Well, you just be sure that you do. Just go on and ignore these little skunks around you. Don't pay attention to them! You have bigger things to think about. If they don't want to play with you, you just tell them to go to hell. Because you're better than any ten of them put together! You understand? Yes, Pop. I understand. Now, you have your studies and you have your grandmother. Your mother. And me. If there's anything you want, you just come to me and tell me about it and I'll get it for you, you understand? Yeah, Pop. I understand. Yeah, alright. Well, your mother is warming some food for you. You better go down and get it. Well Pop, if you don't mind... I'm not too hungry, I think I'll just... I think I'll go to bed. Now that's just what I'm talking about! It's silly to go around moping. Pop, I know it's silly. I know that. Look, I'm going to do what you told me to Pop, but... I just want to go to bed now, if you don't mind. Alright. Goodnight, Pop. Thanks for helping me. That's alright. Spence! Gram! Gram! May! May, come up here! You keep away from me. Mama! Oh, mama! Leave me alone with Spence. But Mama! I want to talk to Spence. I'll go call the doctor. It's alright, Gram. We are going to get the doctor. Don't bother, he's a crack. Will you promise me something? Yes, Gram. Don't you let anything, or anybody, get you down. You respect yourself, and they will respect you. I know, Gram. Please don't talk. There's one more thing. You have to cut off... all that damn swearing. You hear me? Yes, Gram. And you... You... Gram! Hey Mom! Did you call Doctor Stone? I called the doctor, he will be right over. Did you tell him to hurry? I told you, I called the doctor. He will be right... He doesn't have to hurry. She's dead. Where are you going, Spence? I'm going outside. You're better staying here, your mother needs you. I can't... She has you anyway. Now, how can you be so selfish? What's the matter with you? I just want to go outside, that's all! You don't have to go outside to cry, Spence. You don't have to be ashamed before us. Hurry up, Honey. They're waiting for you. Christina, I honestly don't see how I'm going to get through this. You will, eventually. You will. Why don't you come, Christine? Of all the maids we had, Gram hated you the least. I know. But somebody has to stay here, to clean up and put the dinner on the stove. Straighten your tie. Put that away. What are you doing with that cigar? Well I just thought I'd smoke it. Common decency. Surely you could wait until she until after she's buried, at least. Well it's just a cigar! It's not as if I was taking a drink or something. Not that I couldn't stand a good stiff beer. Lem! Isn't this a beautiful place? Yes, you couldn't ask for a nicer day. I have met many mulish quitters. But you are the worst mule I have met. Now why didn't you eat your lunch? I didn't want it. Did you take your tonic? No. I didn't quite catch that. Don't be mumbling at me, boy. Was that yes or no? I said no! Boy, you're going to make a woman some pretty miserable husband one of these days. Because you know I don't believe you're not eating. I think you sneak in that kitchen after I'm gone and eat everything in sight. Did you hear me? Spence, why don't you eat something? Anything? A crust of bread. You know, it kills me when folks don?t eat. I never met somebody who can pick out just the right way to worry somebody. Won't you please go inside and eat just a little bit? I said no! You make me sick. The feeling is very mutual. You know, I've seen a lot of moaning in my day, but if the moaning you do doesn?t beat anything I've seen, I don't want a nickel. Well what do you say if I'm making a bargain with you. What is it? I'll eat that sloppy you made in there if you just leave me alone. You got a deal. Hey, Christine. Come here! What is it? What kind of soup is this? Chicken. Well it tastes awful. What did you put in this? Nothing. What's in... Did you put this tonic in that Christine? Why, does it taste that bad? It tastes just like poison. You sure are a lousy cook. No wonder you can't keep a husband. I'll have you know I only had one husband and he died. I'm not surprised. Spence, I'm not going to talk to you again today. You're not really mad at me, are you Christine? Well I was just kidding. Ah, come on Christine. You know I don't really think you killed your husband. Oh boy, you are a mess. Now what's the matter? I was just thinking... The funeral was four days ago. Wouldn't you have thought at least one of the fellas would have come over to see me by now? Well the last time they were over here, I heard you threw them out. Oh, they know I didn't mean that. I sure do miss Gram, Christine. I miss her a heck of a lot! And she's dead. You can tell yourself that and you can accept it. The guys are different, Christine. They're not dead. They're up at the gym playing basketball or horsing around the park somewhere. Oh, I don't know! Maybe it's my crummy age. Is everybody unhappy at seventeen? You know, Spence, I think it's the law. Were you? Plenty. And don't ask me how long ago that was either. Don't worry, I'm not going to ask you. Maybe it's this town. Were you born here? No. I was born in Birmingham, Alabama. Near the steel mills. You didn't like it much down there, didn't you? No, I didn't like it much down there. I wanted something better I guess. So I decided I would come up North and try my luck. I worked for a year and saved my money. The day I had what was enough I went down to the railroad station. Boy, that was someday. The sun was shining. And I felt real good, you know? Like you feel maybe once or twice in your whole life. When I got down to the ticket window, the man had a calendar with a big advertisement on it for an insurance company. So I looked at the name of the town and told him that's where I wanted my ticket to take me. Then I went home and packed my momma's cardboard suitcase. That same night, I caught the train. That's the last I ever saw my mother, my sisters and brothers, Rustie. Who was Rustie? Rustie was my dog. Did you work for the insurance company? I went into service for a while. And then I got married. And two years after that, my husband died. Two months after he died, I had a baby, and he was born dead. Christine... I'll tell you all I felt like doing was dying myself. But then I realized that you just can't go on like that. There's a lot of living to be done. If you want to live, that's something that you just can't think about too often. Too hard. Yeah... Push them to the back of your mind. So there in the back of my mind I burred my husband and my baby. He never had a name. Well, that's the way the ball bounces. Well you sure made me feel crummy. Well why? Well, I've been giving you a hard time about what's been happening to me. Think nothing of it! You know, I've got to get out of here and to that other job. You don't have to go now, Christine, do you? Can't you stay a little while longer? Why? I want to talk to you. What about? Nothing in particular. I just... Want to talk to you. Oh I'll be back tomorrow, Spence. Well, it's just one thing, Christine. Mhm. I don't know whether I should tell you or not. Oh, sure you can tell me. Are you sure you won't tell anybody? I won't mention it to a soul. No matter what it is? I already said I won't tell, haven't I? Well I want to be with a girl, Christine. What's the matter with you? Nothing, I had to swallow wrong. Tell me something. Have you had much experience? With what? You know with what? Have you had much experience? Enough. Well... I mean, off-hand, how much experience would you say you have? You know, Spence, I think that?s the kind of question that's in every woman's right not to answer, don't you? You think it's pretty nosy, uh? Yeah. I don't only thin kit?s a nosy question, I know it is. Well I'm sorry. Do you know I'm going on 18 years old, and I've never been with a girl? Gee, it's terrible, isn't it? True as heck it is. I was just thinking when I was sick, just suppose I had died. Just suppose I had passed right out and died. I'd regret I have not been with a girl for the rest of my life, practically. Yes, I guess it would be pretty terrible, wouldn't it? You know, I think you're having a heck of a good time laughing at me. I most certainly am not. You don't think it's peculiar or anything? Well how could anything so natural be peculiar? I think we've had enough talk for one afternoon, I have to go. Christine. Uh huh? I want to ask you something. What is it? Do you like me? I certainly do. I was sure hoping you did because, well, I like you too, Christine. Thank you. Now that settles it. Look... Look, I know liking doesn't mean loving or anything, but... I kind of thought that... Well you're lonely, aren't you, Christine? I have been lonely for a long time now. Well in case you didn't know, I'm lonely too. Look, I know you're older than I am. I know it makes a difference, but... Oh, I see... But what I lack in age, I sure make up for in loneliness. We do have that much in common, don't we Christine? Yes... Yes. So maybe if you stay... I mean, since things are like you said they were... Maybe we could find happiness together. Just for a little while, not forever or anything like that. Just for a little while. You're kind of young, Spence. You can be very foolish too, you know that, don't you? Yeah, I know, Christine. And I can be very foolish to listen to you. I know. You say that maybe just for a little while we... We can find happiness together. You know that so soon? Yeah. I don't know, I guess I should be laughing at you, but I'm not. I'll think about it, Spence. Give me a minute... I'll think about it. Well, I think I'll go up to my room now. If you decide you can't stay, you don't need to tell me. You can just go. Good shot, Spence. Oh, hi Mom. Home early today, aren't you? I'm going to fix you a lunch. You didn't have to, Mom. We have some lunch meat, I could've made a sandwich. Well, I have a little surprise for you. Oh, you mean I don?t have to go to school tomorrow? Yes you do, indeed you do. I ran into a couple of the boys, Tony and Gussie, they are coming over to see you this afternoon. Oh yeah? And I thought it would be nice if I did some ice cream and cakes. They will be right over after they finish their ball game. As a matter of fact, they said why don't you come over and play a few innings if you feel up to it. No, I'm not in shape, Mom. It will be nice seeing them, though. It's about time they came over. Hello Mrs. Scott. Hiya, sugar. Hi Chris. Just dropped in to pick up the rest of my things. Well if you wait just a minute, Christine, I'll have your money for you. Good, good. That stuff comes in handy. Hey, what the heck is going on here. I guess I'm leaving. Sort of. Leaving? Well, you see, there's no longer Gram to look after, and you're fine Spence, so we don't need anymore help. Yeah, Mom, but I thought... What is there to think? If you don't need any work to be done, you don't need anyone to do it. Christine understands that, don't you Christine? Oh yes. Yes, I'm the understanding type. Christine, I know the notice was a bit short so I've added an extra week's pay. Thank you. Glad I'm not too proud to take it. So long, sugar. That was a lousy trick, Mom. What are you talking about, Spence? You know what I'm talking about. Giving Christine the boot! I don't call an extra week's pay "the boot". We don't need Christine anymore. And we're not rich enough to afford help we don't need. I don't care what you call it, Mom, it was a stinking trick. Spence, you watch how you talk to me. And what's all this interest in Christine? Nothing, I just thought. I know what you just thought, young man, and don't you think I don't. Now what are you talking about? You know my eyes weren't put on... The way they were put on for nothing, yeah, I know. All that pampering and cuddling she did with you made me sick to my stomach. Now what do you mean by that? I don't know. What should I mean by that? Maybe you can tell me. You know, I've heard stories of boys being left alone in houses with maids before. Now I'm not saying it's gone that far, but an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of anybody's cure. You know, you sure have a dirty mind, Mom. Don't be so sure it's I who has a dirty mind. And if you say that to me again, you will get a good slap for your pains. How in hell did... Now don't use that kind of language. Well if you can pull a stinking stunt like firing Christine, I can use that kind of language. And speaking of stunts, what's this song and dance about you bumping into the boys? I bet you didn't bump into them at all. I bet you called them. Oh, I can just hear you now. Why don't you come over fellas and see Spence? I'll have some cake and ice cream. For crying out loud! Mom, you did call them. What if I did? They're your friends. You lied to me. Well you can call them right back, and tell them to stay the hell at home, Mom! I most certainly will not. You heard what I said, you can call them right back and tell them to stay at home! Why did you have to go and do that for anyway? Look, I'm not going to bribe those kids into being my friends with cake, pink punch and ice cream! I don't ever have to bribe anybody to be my friend. You will do as you're told and you'll stop being so fresh! And I don't want to hear another word out of you about what you will do and what you won't do! When you start talking like that, it's about time you got out and got a job of your own, and bought a house of your own. But as long as you're under this roof, you're going to do as you're told! Where are you going? I'm going to get the hell out of here. Well go ahead. Go ahead and see how far you get acting the way you act. Your father is right about you, you're too proud. You think you can go through life being proud, don't you? Well, you're wrong. You are a little black boy, and you don't seem to understand it, but that's what you are! You think this is bad? Well it will be worse! You'll serve them pink punch and ice cream, and you'll do a lot worse! You'll laugh at them when you feel like crying. You'll smile at them when you could put knives right into their backs without giving it a second thought. And you'll never do what you've done and let them know they?ve hurt you! They never forgive you for that. So go on out and learn the lesson! Get out of here and don't ever come back! You think it's easy for me to tell my son to crawl when I know he can walk and walk well? I'm sorry I ever had children! I'm sorry you didn't die when you were a baby. Do you hear that? I'm sorry you didn't die! You want to know something, Mom? I'm kind of sorry about that myself! Christine! Christine! Christine! Wait! Spence! I'm going with you. Oh, you are? You bet I am. I'm not going to stay in that house. I don't have to beg anyone to be my friend with cake and ice cream and pink punch! Dammit, I hate being black, Christine! I hate it, I hate it! I hate the hell out of it! No, no... You don't mean that, boy. Christine, what am I going to do? I don't know. But I'll tell you one thing, you're going to be black for a long time. And you have to learn to live with it. Do you realize that I don?t even know where you live? How can I get in touch with you? Fine, that's just the way it should be. Well aren't you my friend? Sure, sure, I'm your friend, but you can't come crying to me all the time as if I was Gram. But you're going to grow up, Spence! You're going to stand on your own two feet. You know, Spence, there are so many wonderful things that will happen to you if you just had the patience to wait for them. Spence, you know something? Did it ever occur to you, that if you were not black, you would never have known your grandmother. So long, sugar. Hello Mr. Scott. How are you, boys? Gussie. Bobby. Spence should be here any minute. Well, are you boys boning up on the midterms at school? Oh yeah! And I know somebody who better bone up on his algebra, or he's not going to get his diploma. Me? Bone up on algebra? What am I, a Russian? How are things at the bank, Mr. Scott? Oh well... We are keeping busy. Keeping busy, yes indeed. Hi Spence. Hi Spence. How are you? Hey! We told your folks how sorry we were to hear about your grandmother, Spence. Yeah, I used to get a kick out of old Mrs. Scott. Martin, you goon. Her name was Martin. I'm sorry, I meant Martin. Looks, fellas. I hate to say this, but... Well this is sort of a farewell party. I'm going to college this fall. Got to turn over a new leaf. Hit the books real hard, man. Not too much time for socializing, if you know what I mean. Yeah. Sure. You know, I guess it wouldn't hurt the rest of us to hit the books a little either, you know? Wouldn't hurt you, maybe. It would kill me! The table is set up in the backyard, boys. Take an ice cream, already. Yeah, fellas. Go ahead, I'll change my shirt in your honor. Spence? Yeah, Alan? Are you really going to college? Well, I hope so, man. Which one? Well, I was thinking about State if I get the marks. Really? I've been thinking about going to State too. Oh yeah? Yeah, perhaps we could be eggheads together. Yeah, that sounds good Alan. Let's talk about it, man. You know, Pop. I guess you don't have to be colored to be unhappy. No, but it sure helps! You ought to be on television, Pop! Well, I'll be down at that bank. You know, you had me worried there for a moment. I thought perhaps you may lace into the boys. May. Son. OK, Pop. See ya. Don't you see what I did, Mom? I said goodbye to them before they say it to me. But they're your friends, Spence, they really are. I know, Mom. I know they're my friends. Up to a point. We go to school together. Play ball. And after that... Oh, Spence. Don't worry, Mom. I can't let that throw me, Mom. I have a lot of living to do. A lot of living. I have to live so people can respect me, Mom. So I can respect myself. Like Gram always said. I don't know if you did the right thing, Spence. I don't know if I've been wrong all along. What I do know, is that all I've ever wanted, is for you to be happy. I can't honestly find anything wrong with that, Mom. I better go change my shirt. Spence. Yes, Mom. I love you very much. I love you too, Mom. Closed captioning is provided by Studio Sonogram.
