Do you work tomorrow? Yes, very early. And you? Me too. I used to be able to go out on a Thursday, drink a lot, then go to work the next day like nothing happened. I haven't done that in a while, I just fall asleep. The same thing happens to me a disaster. Why do you travel so much? Do you work in tourism or at a hotel? I'm a tourist. A great job, I want it. I work in a travel agency, from 9 to 6. And you? I'm a physical therapist for all kinds of people, specially third age. Also do sports rehabilitation. So, if I injure myself running or at the gym... I rehabilitate you. Will I see you again? I don't think so. But thank you. I felt very comfortable. Well, bye. Bye. 7:20 Once a Week The day we met, was with my cousin She was the redhead. A while back she was having routine exams and suddenly something came back positive. She went through chemo, and got cured, finally. Every year I go with her to get her tests done and once a year we have that fear. They said she was clear, that everything was good. We both wanted to celebrate have a good time and I ended up here with you. So that night you were celebrating life? Literally. I'm glad, for your cousin and myself. I like the way you laugh. I like that about you. When I was a kid I didn't laugh at all; I was very serious. Really? I was super structured, you should've seen my notebooks from school, all organized... I never ripped a page, and had perfect handwriting. And I never smiled. I can't imagine you being like that. Yeah, I had a boyfriend that hated it. He said I couldn't tell jokes. Once, I rehearsed one. First I had to pick one. I searched everywhere for "The best joke in the world." And memorized it. One night in the middle of dinner with his group of friends I told the joke. No one laughed. I'm not saying that they barely laughed. No one laughed. - What was the joke? - What? The joke, what was it? I know almost all of them. Don't make fun of me. Two hunters go to the woods, One of them passes out and isn't breathing. The other calls the emergency number and asks: "I think my friend is dead. What should I do?" Keep calm sir. First, make sure your friend is truly dead". There's silence. A gunshot is heard. The hunter returns to the phone and says "Okay, what do I do now?" That's a very bad joke. Come in. What are you thinking about? That I'm lucky, and that you are perfect. That's because you don't know me. Humiliating and gross thing always happen to me. At first I was a little disgusted by oral sex. One day I'm with a guy, going at it, and suddenly the guy doesn't give me a heads up... And boom! With a full mouth I try to be sexy, and I approach him so he can see me but I couldn't take it, and I threw up on his face. And what happened to the guy? I don't know... He was taking a shower, and I ran out, and I never saw him again. Every year in my job they have a costume party it's the week of the clinic, there are teams, the different units compete against one another. It's important to participate. And I dressed up as Batman. Batman is sexy. It was a good costume. The thing is that is was a little small for me, too tight. Well, I got to the place, and my costume was just the best. I was a finalist, and I had to get on stage and something terrible happened For an unknown reason I started thinking... I can't have an erection", "There's no reason for me to get an erection." A stupid thought because, why would I have an erection, on a stage, dressed up as Batman, and wearing tights? Well. Apparently thinking about it too much caused the opposite effect because I started having porn thoughts And I had one. The costume got so tight that I couldn't even move. Then of course I win, they give me a trophy, and I try to cover myself with it but they ask me to raise it... And I did. And then it was out in the open... There was a big silence, and everyone was looking at me and suddenly a nurse shouts, "Watch out, he has a weapon!" I don't know much, all I know is that they couldn't stop laughing... Stop, stop. No, no. - Here. - What? Listen. ♪ The waves have become giants, while I drown ♪ My feet are not the same, after all ♪ The clouds have become bigger, as I go away ♪ ﻿My eyes don't see like they used to ♪ I've become older I've become bigger ♪ The clouds have become bigger, as I go away ♪ My eyes don't see like they used to ♪ I've become older I've become bigger ♪ I've become wiser, but more of a coward ♪ ﻿More of a coward. ♪ More of a coward. You never mentioned your wife. No. - What does she do? - She's a teacher... To children between five and six years old. One day I picked her up at work and saw how much she cared about those kids and one approached her so she would tie his laces. She walked him slowly through the steps. A sequence he will repeat his whole life. That won me over. I told myself I would love her forever. I guess that doesn't make me very consistent. What? Nothing. What are you thinking about? That I don't know you. It's little time to know someone. Time has nothing to do with it. There's people married for 15 years and don't know if their spouse likes broccoli or cats. Basic stuff about the other person, what they like in bed or what they hate. Time has nothing to do with it. They say it lasts three months. So you are saying, this. Will end. Should end. Where's your friend? Travelling. Are you going to tell her? Maybe. I love bed picnics, isn't it the perfect concept? A friend told me: never sleep with someone you can't eat in bed with. Eating is very intimate. Grabbing things to put in your mouth, it's very sexual. They say a man fucks like he eats: if he is clean, he will be clean. And if he spills or slurps when he eats? He's very passionate. Japanese have this technique of eating sushi over a woman's body. Don't think about it. No... No. No... Soy. I brought you something. What's this? For you. For me? Yes. With my name. A notebook? Don't be fooled, it's a paper computer. Look, here are the applications, contacts, calendars, notes, reminders, here are the projects you are working on, and the files. No batteries, you don't have to turn it on or update it, always available. I have a friend that has a stationary store. We're going to make more to sell. You made this? Yes. I have my own shop at home, and I'm always doing something with paper. What about the travel agency and your 9-6 job? I thought that if I told you that I'm a woman that does "nothing" and has a rich husband, you would've thought "'Here's the typical bored woman that wants and adventure'." I don't think anything I'm just here. That's it. Which one is your friend? That one. Does she travel a lot? Yeah... She imports clothes, that's why she travels all the time. Who are they? That's... her sister, her nephew and her sister's husband. They seem like good people. They are, a beautiful family. They love each other. We should make a trip. I don't know. Go far away. To what city? A city we can walk, with history, not very crowded, rather secluded. It would be the first time we would be out on the street. Be with you amongst people without looking everywhere. Is that complicated? What I'm saying is that we've never done what normal couples do. We've never walked holding hands in a park. We've never gone to the beach. We've never grabbed a coffee and done nothing but just being. When you are here, what do you tell her? Where are you supposed to be? That I'm taking a class on sports injuries. Every Thursday. And you? Movies with friends. And he never asks what movie you watched? He trusts me. What's wrong? Every day I think about you. If something funny happens, who do I want to tell? You. If something wrong happens I want to call you. I want to be with you all the time. Locked up, here. There's a kid. Well, he's 16. Jonas. He goes to the clinic every Wednesday. The mother travels two hours to take him and waits while I work on him. At the end, she asks me if I see him getting better and I tell her I do, that he's progressing. It's not true... He doesn't move a muscle. He has a degenerative condition. But I tell her that he's doing great and she smiles. Can he get better? The other day, I thought I saw him smiling. He can't, but that's what I thought. I tell him stories, I tell him about an assistant of ours, a very pretty girl, Rosita. I say she's in love with him and will declare her love. I tell him "Look, there's your girlfriend." And he looks at me. What is going on in that mind? I'm not sure. All I know is that he's in love with Rosita. I need to stop doing that. The other day she was making out with one of the ER nurses. And I thought, my patient can't see that, that would break his heart. I want to be with you. Have a life with you. Last night I had a dream. About? I was by a river, more like a stream. There was a tree trunk, and I didn't know if I should cross. Then you showed up, we had two girls, they were twins. You have kids? No... I can't have kids. I'm sorry. I don't know if you're sorry. I don't know. My husband wanted kids a lot of kids. He's from a big family and dreamt of a bunch of kids running around. But that wasn't the case. We're a family of two. Have you thought about adopting? No. I don't want to. I might seem selfish, and maybe I am. But I got so used to the fact that I'm not going to be a mom, that I don't think about it. My sister once took me to an adoption agency, but we didn't go in. We didn't even leave the car. We stayed there, talking. I was scared. Scared? I just couldn't get out of that car. I have a son. His name is Nicolas. How old is he? Nine. He has special needs. He laughs, plays, loves me but doesn't show it. What's going to happen to him when he's older, and I'm not there to take care of him? How is he going to go through life? The basics? Is he going to be happy? Will he be bullied? Will he survive the damn teenage years? Will he avoid getting into a car with one of his drunk friends? And all the dangerous things we did, but don't want our kids to do... but they will anyways. Sounds awful. It is, but it's worth it. Sounds common, but that kind of love is real. The rest is just.. Lies? No, not lies. They're different. That's it, you can't compare them. - Come in. - Sure. Last Thursday while I waited for you, I wrote. My handwriting is horrible, I'm more used to using the computer, but I wrote the things I want and don't want to do with you. It's incredible the things I came up with in two hours. Or was it three? Well. Things to do with Julia. Be with her in bed in a cold place, under the covers, covered up to our noses, whispering while it rains hug her, watch her sleep, feel her breathing, laugh, eat chocolate make love, have sex, fuck. Talk, dance, argue, theorize, antagonize, whisper, listen to music, all under the covers. Leave a surprise in her purse bite her, undress her slowly, undress her with haste shower, get dirty, and daub our bodies, drive her crazy, make her scream, watch her look through the window in the darkness, have a daughter or theorize about it, read the books she reads grow old with her... And at the same time forget her, have her forget me walk away, have her walk away, lose her without pain softly, have her lose me without pain, softly, be at peace, have her be at peace, may time never pass and may it pass... Did you like it? I'd never written anything but prescriptions and treatments. Three hours. I waited outside for three hours. I couldn't make it. - You could've told me. - My battery died. - You could've borrowed a charger. - I couldn't. Where were you? Were you fucking your husband? Or planned to end this and forgot to tell me? Leave. Julia... I know you. I know something happened. Why didn't you make it on Thursday? Look at me. I wanted to rip you out. I didn't want to feel this. So I called some friends and went dancing somewhere. But at the same time, I couldn't stop thinking you were here waiting for me. And I knew it would've taken very little for me to take a taxi and be here with you. And there was a guy at the bar looking at me, tall, blond, with a beard. And I thought, I want to feel that beard in my mouth, I want to feel that beard down here. So I kissed him. And while we were walking in the parking lot, he stopped me, and stuck his hand between my legs. As soon as we got into his car we were fucking like animals. From behind and everywhere like dogs in heat. Do you want anything? No, thank you. You've been okay? Yes. You? Yes, well. These weeks have been quiet. It feels like so long ago, right? Yes. And your friend? I told her about you, finally. What did you tell her? That you were cute. What did she say? She told me not to let you go. Can you tell her something from me? Yes. Sure. Tell her that her music sucks. ♪ Don't ask me to leave you ♪ You're not going to achieve it ♪ The love I have inside The love I have inside ♪ Will accompany me to the end ♪ Don't want me to not look at you ♪ If your eyes are my light ♪ Two bright stars that light up ♪ In the night, the reason of the blue sea ♪ Because I keep your love... What are you going to do when we meet again? When we meet again? Yes. Five years from now, at a supermarket. I will say hello like a normal person. Hi Julia... it's Manuel. I don't know if you remember me. Of course, nice to see you. How are you? I'm good. How long has it been? Eight? Ten years? Ten, ten years. How's it going with the paper computers? Well. I've done well. And you? I finally got divorced, and left kinesiology. Opened a record store. Vinyl, only classics. Are you still married? No, I got divorced. He has a girlfriend ten years younger and three kids. Do you think about me sometimes? A lot. And you?

I brought you something. Here. Thank you. It was my mother's... The only thing of hers I kept. I want you to have it. You... You shouldn't have. It's broken anyways, It doesn't tell time anymore. I tried to fix it, but I think is better like that, anyway. Always at 7:20. Thank you. Let's go for a walk. A few blocks amongst people, like normal people. Even if it's just this once. I never told you about my husband. Last Tuesday he returned from a quick trip, a business trip. I never go to pick him up, but that day I went to the airport as a surprise. It was spontaneous, I wanted to do it. People started leaving the gate and. I saw him holding a little boy, three or four years old. I was surprised and I didn't know what to think. Then I saw that he was helping a passenger that had a mess with her bags, and he was holding her son as a kind gesture. When he returned the boy, for a second my husband caressed his head and kissed his forehead. And at a distance. That gesture... A gesture so simple and irrelevant, made me see how much he wanted a child, and how much he loves me, without telling me, despite not having one. And I knew that was my place, that I wanted to be with him. Not because I'm giving up or used to it, but because what we have, and what we don't have... is true love. Well. Maybe in another time.
