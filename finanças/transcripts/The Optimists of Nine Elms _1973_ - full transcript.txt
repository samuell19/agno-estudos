There might have been nine trees there once, but the time we're talking about, Nine Elms didn't mean trees, it meant foggy winter, the noise of trains, but most of all, it meant Sam, the first to show us the world on the other side of the river. Bella, come here. Come here. Come here. Ten years, teach you how to do one trick and can't bloody do it.

SAM ( reciting ): I once went to battle And bravely I fought As a brave British soldier Should do Then Lord Nelson said "Sam, our powder's run short" "So, of course We're depending on you" Thousands of Zulus Came gussing along And I pushed to the front And I said "If you boys don't go I shall sing you a song" So they threw down their spears And they fled ( rimshot sounds ) MUM: Please, Dad, once. Give me a hand with this. DAD: I'd pay for it though, would I? MUM: I work twice as hard doing that laundry. Money isn't everything. Gotta have a bit of a family life. A break. DAD: It might be nice to have a break from your nagging. The way you talk, anybody would think I was up at the bloody seaside for the day. MUM: Calls it work and talks about football half the time. I thought I asked you to get me some bread yesterday. I did. I didn't ask you to eat it all. Gonna have to get me some. And you, it's about time you stop using that. He can use it for a goldfish bowl. Shut your mouth. Shut your own, it's closer. Not so much of it. Go and get yourself washed. Go on. MUM: Sometimes when I look at this lot. It might help if she was a bit less free with her lip. DAD: Wonder which side of the family she gets that from. GIRL: That Saturday began as most Saturdays did, with them rowing about Dad going off to work and Mum being left on her own with us. But overtime meant more money, and more money meant more chance of that new house they were always talking about. MUM: Liz, your dad's left you some money. It's on the table. Don't forget to clean your teeth. Blach! Hey, mister, who's dead? BOY: Nobody's dead, is there, mister? See, there's nothing wrong with her. She's just old, that's all. What you got? Half's mine. Who said? Our dad. Not here now, is he? He's working on a Saturday. LIZ: It he works every Saturday and Sunday for a whole month, he could earn more money than a whole year put together. You never think about that, do you? You're too selfish. He said I can have one. Well, think about it. If you want a new set, someone's gotta pay for the curtains, ain't they? Not gonna be you, is it? He said that you should give me one. Here, want a sweet? Yeah. Sack you both. ( emotive theme playing ) BOY: It's that, then? That's where you said we were going to live.

Now, don't say I never give you naught. What's in it? What's in it? You should be grateful. If I had an house, a nice big house, I know what I'd do. I'd have a cat and I'd have a dog with a bloody, fine view. Thanks, mister. That's not funny. No, but it's clean. MARK: This a picnic, mister? SAM: Aye. It isn't. A picnic's gotta be in the country. Oh, aye, who told you that? Our dad. Did he? Yeah. A picnic's gotta have flowers and grass. Oh, what else did he say, your dad? Tell an apple from an onion because he's always crying? A picnic's where you're enjoying it. You enjoying it? Right, then, it's a picnic. A picnic's a flaming picnic. It's not. That's a rude word. Use your handkerchief. Coughs and sneezes spread diseases. Charming manner that child's got. Charming. Like that fella that lived next door. Spent all day teaching himself how to be a brass band. Funny thing, he played the fiddle. ( boat whistle blows ) What's he doing, earwigging again? It's all inside here, you know. Don't you know that? Inside your head, you can build... A skyscraper? Aye. Ah... A palace. A what? An apple?

Have a big funeral. Bigger than Queen Victoria's? Bigger than Mr. Potter's at the barbers? Mr. Potter won't know he's deceased. Ha! Will she have flowers? Oh, I should say so. Feathers and trumpets, black horses, brass bands. They'll all be there for our Bella. Heh, heh. In the middle of Hyde Park in the biggest cemetery in the world. You gotta do it in style, you see. I mean, having a good funeral is like having a good life. Something to look forward to, you see. I mean, you've got to let people know when you've gone. 'Course I've seen it, you know. It's in the middle of Hyde Park. Towering tombstones. Undertakers with hats as tall as chimneys. "Come in," they'd say. "Come in and have a lie down "if you've naught else to do. " Oh, aye. You've got to be a special dog to be buried there. Is Bella a special dog? Is she a special dog? What are you talking about? I've told you, "bella" is Italian for "beautiful. " Mark my words, they'll remember Bella in Hyde Park when you and me are long gone and forgotten. Can we come to the funeral, mister? Oh, aye, I dare say, Bella or me'll send you an invitation. She's a lady, you know, she's got a pedigree and all that. You'll get invited. A card, you know. No she won't. Oh, aye, Mrs. Lopsided? 'Cause she'll be dead.

Won't take you because there's not one, is there? Will you, mister? Can we, mister? I'll take you. Where is it then? Don't believe you. It's across the river. One seventy-three bus. That's where it is. You'll take me, mister. Won't you? Across the river? Can we, mister? Cross the river? Oh. Oh, you've changed your mind now, have you? To see the new buildings. The high one son the other side of the river. 'Cause that's where we're gonna live. Well, as soon as I've fed Bella, then. Can't, mister. Not now. It's our mom. Oh, you were poking fun at me, were you? She's expecting us. Tomorrow we can though. After dinner. Honestly. Oh, I don't know about tomorrow. Tomorrow's another day, isn't it? I'll have to think about that. I don't know. I mean... Oh. Go on, Bella. Come on. That's a good girl. Ta, mister. I said "Maybe," mind. Maybe means perhaps. And perhaps means if. And if means maybe. And that's all I've said, mind. MARK: Ta, mister. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow.

Besides, even if we did get it, it doesn't mean we'd enjoy it. Not as if we got something to look after. I mean, if we had a dog or something. It could keep us company and keep off burglars. Burglars? What we got to burgle? Honestly, look at it? What do you kids get up to? It's not my fault. Well, you're the oldest. You should look after him. Why should I? Same reason we look after you.

That's me last and final offer. What do you say? You've got two hours, haven't you? I can't leave her. Ten pennies each, mister, an hour. Oh, that's it. I knew she were bargaining. You really mean it, don't you, mister? Aye. She got you affairs. ( door closes ) Well, come in if you're coming. You can give her some milk if she wants it. You'll need to warm it up a bit. And, uh, give her one of these dog pills if she gets a bit-- ( coughs ) But don't take none yourself. I'm not a dog. I'll be back about eight o'clock. You'd better be. Huh. ( clattering ) ( tambourine rattling ) Hey, don't touch anything, you hear? That's all private, is that. My private things. If you do, I'll know about it. There's a fella lives in that wardrobe. Been in there for years. One of my lodgers. I saw that. I saw it. Ah. You'd better let her go to sleep. No. She mightn't wake up. LIZ: Might be a blessing. ( uplifting theme playing ) You're not supposed to touch anything. What are you doing then? Supposing he comes back? Supposing, supposing. Eight o'clock, you said. Look after her, you said. I'd pay, I said. Who's babysitting who? That's what I want to know. ( sneezes, then barks ) Feeling better, are we? ( chuckles ) A man's got no business doing business with kids. Might as well try riding a three-legged donkey. Can we have our money, please? Oh, you're wide awake now, aren't you? Wide awake, yeah. Right then. May as well settle me debts. ( yawns ) Ten, 20, 30, 40. Don't be late tomorrow. Come on. Bye, mister. Thanks, mister. ( door opens ) Bye. It could have been worse, you know, love. ( door closes ) You might have been run over. Hm? Shall we do the fandango, or would you prefer a bit of formation dancing? Have we got enough? One pound 15 pennies. How much do we want? Tomorrow after school. The gates of hell. Best repent for your sins, mate. Haven't got any. Can't afford them. Aye, aye, it's our Georgie. Hey, Georgie, you know what she calls you? Passion pants. Can't help being handsome though, can he? No, but it helps. ( steam hissing ) Hey! You two! What are you doing down there? Go on, out! Go on! Out! Don't you know your own dad? Go on! Out! Wait for me outside! Now what's wrong? Nothing. Nothing? Well, what'd you break in for? You could have had an accident, got burned, broken your neck or something. You say it's nothing? Now come on, what is it? We wanted to talk to you. We wanted to ask you something. What? Don't matter. Oh, that's great, isn't it? That's typical, that is. Almost lose me my job and now it don't matter. Now what don't? And don't say "nothing. " You've got a face like a horse's backside, and you say it's nothing. Now come on, what is it? We want some money. Yeah, don't we all. Only two pounds. Two pounds. Why not a fiver? Or didn't you know they made them that colour? We want to get something. Yeah, you're lucky you didn't get it from me. Clown around here, all. Now how about clearing off? Because I'm in a good mood. I'll see you at home. Aren't you coming then? I'm still working, ain't I? Then I've got an appointment at the housing. We wanted to talk to you. Well, you're talking. And don't tell your mother. It's supposed to be a surprise. Hang on. Clear off. I'll see you in the morning. ( door closes )( whines ) LIZ: Sorry we're late, mister. It was our dad. SAM: Did he give you the money? Oh. No, you wouldn't be here if he did, would you? Hm. Pretty cow's milk. Ought to be dog's milk. No wonder she's not getting any better. Here, watch it. It's hot. Aren't you going out then? Oh, up to your lolly, are you? Aye. Aren't you going out then? ( chuckles ) It's that darn coat on down the street. Old fellow there will get enough to eat. I'll give you a fair warning. If you're late again, you'll be too late. ( door closes ) ( barks ) Hm. Didn't you go then? Aye, it's me outside and me ghost in here. It were raining so I didn't feel like doing any dancing, you know. I never do in the rain. Hey. It's finished. Why don't you get her some more? I'll do it. Oh, no, no, I'll do it. I've been managing for meself for 20 years. Women's thoughts are few. Everything they say and everything they do. You can go out. I'm staying in. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Sit down. I've got a proposition I'm going to make to you. Get your eyes on that lot. Now then. How much do you still need for your dog? Eh? One pound, 1 pound 10, 1 pound 20, 1 pound 30, 1 pound 40. Any advance on 40? Do I hear an advance on 40? One pound 50, 1 pound 60. Five. Five to the lady. One pound 65. So that's, uh, five hours in advance we'll call that, shall we? Say it. No. You come back tomorrow. Then we'll go and get your mongrel. If you like, mister. If I like? Is that all you got to say? Thanks, mister. Now that's better. All right. Off your go, then. Here. Hang on. Here. So I changed me mind. I change me mind more than you change your underwear. ( majestic theme playing ) ( exhaust hissing ) Come on, lazy bones. Rise and shine. Come on now. Yeah, that's surprising, isn't it? Hey? Did you get it? What? The new house. Well, did you? Now what do you think? Four more weeks we say goodbye to this lot. Yeah, we say goodbye to that as well. Have to learn to do without that. ( laughs ) Hey, what's that for? You. Did you tell Mum? Yeah, we're going shopping afterwards, so if you want to come you'd better hurry. No, I don't think so. She'll only shout at us. Now don't be cheeky. Where are we going? Washing. What are we taking that for? Nothing to do with you, anyway. No wonder your ma goes crazy locked up with you all day. ( uplifting theme playing ) ( both laugh ) ( barking ) ( inaudible dialogue ) ( "This Old Man" playing ) Come on, Battersea. Over. Over. Go on. ( barks ) Go on. Under now. Go under. Go on, try it. Over. Lift your legs a bit more. MARK: You're supposed to go under, not over, you silly fool. LIZ: She can go under. Go on, over, Battersea. Go on. Now over. Try it. Come on, try it. LIZ: Jump. Good. ( whimpering ) LIZ: Go on. Now under. MARK: Over. Over. Under. Come on, Battersea, under. Under. Under. Go on. Under. That's not the way to do it. I'll show you how we do it in the circus, shall I? Oh. Now come here. Hold that. Give us Battersea. Come here, Battersea. And right, Battersea, show it to her first, you see? Now, come on. Alley-oop. That's it. That's a lovely girl. And this way. There we go. Alley-oop! And again. And up!( panting ) Now then, this is how you teach them to beg. You take a morsel of food in the right hand. Here, Battersea. Hop, hop. Come on. Hop. That's it. Now, now, that's a good girl. Come on. What's that? What is it? You see, now? Look at that. See? Eating out of me hand like a tame mongrel. That's very good. That's very good is that, you see? Now, if I leave it, it should stay there. Wait a minute. Stay there. Stay. Stay. Stay. Oh! Here, see? First time. She fell over. I know. Hey, give her a chance. She's new to it. Go on. Stand up, love. That's it. Stand. Stand. Stand. Good girl. Good girl. Stay. Oh! Look at that, see? One finger. Look at that. Isn't that lovely? Look at it. Look. See? Now stay. Now, go, go. Come on. Come on, stay. Stay. It's easy, really. Now I'll sit there with it like that, you see. And we'll sit and watch the river. Come on sit. Sit next to her. Hold the other hand. Sit next to her like that. That's it. And look out there, you see? Pretend... Pretend we don't notice that she's doing it too. That's it. Isn't it lovely? Leave her. It's all this sunshine and fresh air. Gas works on sea. Do you want us to babysit for her, mister? No, no. Well, maybe later, I don't know. A bit later. Bye. Bye, love. ( dog whimpering ) MARK: Goodbye! Whose silly idea was this anyway? Yours, I suppose! Oh, yeah. I haven't got enough to do, I want another stinking mess. Because I want it out. Well, what are you closing the door for then? Oh, so you want the whole house to hear? Yeah, well, if you think I'm so stupid, why not let them all know? Yeah, all right. So it wasn't your idea. So where'd they get the money from, hey? Well, where'd you get the money from? Come on, where'd you get the money from? We bought it. MUM: Oh, I can believe that. Oh, yes, I can just believe that. It was our own money. And this is my house. So you can just take that right out again. MUM: Come on, out. I don't want any more. ( whimpering )Leave her, leave her! Now look at that. Another rotten mess. Well, it's your own fault, pulling it about like that. What do you expect the thing to do, get up and dance for you? Here, you. Go tie it up out in the backyard. Come on. And you, go get a bucket. Sure. Do you want me to tan your backside? Hey? Fascist. Now listen, I'm trying to be reasonable. I don't care where you got it from. I just want you to take it straight back. I'm not going to. You've got your new house. Now what's that got to do with it? Well, why can't we keep our new dog? Because you can't. ( whining ) I'm trying to explain to you. Even if I said you could, you can't because they don't allow them. They do. I'm telling you, there's a big sign up outside saying, "No animals and no pets. " They do. I've seen them. And wash your hands. Is she calling me a liar? I don't know why you bother to even talk to them. Sit down here and have your dinner. The council don't allow dogs. They do. We've seen them. That's it! You can have your dinner when you come back. We'll soon see who's calling me a liar. And if I'm right, that bitch goes right back. Do you understand? ( dramatic theme playing ) Where do you think you're going? Across the river. You're getting very grand all of a sudden, ain't you? We thought-- That's Westminster. Well, are you coming or aren't you? ( truck engine sputtering ) Now you can read, can't you? Now go on, read it. Go on, read it. Go on. "Notice to tenants-- "Yeah, yeah, go on. "By order of the council-- "Yeah. "in pursuance of their authority-- " Yeah, go on, go on. "and the section four of the Housing Act-- " Go on, the next bit, the next bit. Go on. "No pets-- " Yeah. What? No pets. Go on read it again. What? "No pets-- "Yeah. "of any kind-- "Yeah. "to be kept, housed-- " DAD: Yeah, go on. Go on. ( dramatic theme playing ) ( both panting ) You're not coming. Why can't I? Because you're not. I'm coming. ( opera playing on Victrola ) I say, I say, I say. What do you say? What do you say? Is it cruel to stick pins in spiders? Of course it's cruel to stick spins in spiders. Then can you tell me why they sew buttons on flies? I don't wish to know that. Kindly leave the slums. All right, gentlemen, from the top. A one, two, three, four. * Sometimes it wasn't half... * ( mumbling ) * And sometimes... * That's it. ( whispering ):Three, four, five. Eight beats rest. * Sometimes... * ( humming ) * Sometimes... * ( rattling )Give us the dog. ( whimpers ) Oh, well. Get that mangy, bloody thing with a leg in each corner out of here. Go on. All of you, get out. Go on. Out! Out of here. I want you out of here. Out, out. I thought I told you to go. ( hums ) We've come to live with you. Why? We can go basking together. Really? With Samuel Hall, Samuel Hall. My name is Samuel Hall, Samuel Hall. My name is Samuel Hall. And I hate you one and all. Hate you one and all. Glass in your eye. She's dead, isn't she, mister? Aye, she's dead. Aye. She's gone. Like they all do. You know, when I was a little boy, I come home from school one day-- ( chuckles ) and I found me folks had moved. They kept leaving little hints like wrapping me lunch up in a road map. You know. Go on. Out of the house. I don't want no more of you or your mongrel. Go on, out. I thought we could share her, mister. It was your money. You could teach her a few tricks. Tricks, yeah. After the funeral. Funeral. LIZ: You're lying, aren't you, mister? There's not going to be no funeral, is there? Lying? Oh, lying-- Lying in state... Lying in state now we get shiny trumpets, you know. And flowers? Yeah, bells. Canterbury bells. It's a discount for Bella. Discount for this one. You've seen them, you know. They dump it all in barges. Take it out to sea and that's the end of it. They give you a couple of glasses. Drink that up with the compliments of the management. Because you're going under. Heh, heh. Oh, aye, there's going to be a big funeral, all right. In Hyde Park? Aye, in Hyde Park, aye. It's only been closed 100 years. They're bound to open up for me. For old Sam. I mean, me being the common man, you know. Counsel and servant of the Queen. Is that what you want? Is that what you want, is it? It's all gone. Go on, turn around. * Champagne Charlie is me name * * Champagne Charlie is me name * * Game for anything and... * ( humming ) ( "Champagne Charlie" playing ) No peeking now. If you don't find me here when I come back, it's because I don't want you here. Understand? No funeral, not like this. * A sailor was saying farewell To his horse * * He was saying farewell, Cheerio * * Oh, a goodbye Mary I'm going away to sea * * I'm going away to sea to sea To see what I can see * * And when I come back, Mary * * And you'll fill me With delight * * So it's goodbye forever * * I'll be back tomorrow night * * Diddly dum-dum-dum * ( humming ) ( clattering )( whistle blows ) It's nothing. I just slipped. Not enough sawdust. Mind yourself. We're not supposed to be here. He doesn't want us. Ew. He will if there's a funeral. He doesn't want a funeral. He does. He's just a little bit upset, that's all. ( "Champagne Charlie" playing ) You mustn't. Got to, for the bus. Put this back. I'm going to write him a note explaining. I say, I say, I say. What would you like, sir? Hm? I'll have a large, I say. Well? Nothing. Not a sign. Well, he must have said something. Nothing, I told you. ( James crying ) Oh, shut him up. Feed him or whatever it is you have to do. They'll be home when they're hungry. Where the hell did they get the little bleeder anyway? Oh, I thought that was supposed to be my fault. Oh, don't be so dramatic. What difference does it make where they got it from, eh? The kids could be dead in Oxford Lane. And all you think about is their bloody dog. Well, what do you expect me to do? Go traipsing around the bloody streets all night? Yes, I do. ( eerie theme playing ) Are you coming? Give us it then. ( cat meowing ) Cowardy. I'm not. Coming? Nothing to be frightened of. ( bird cawing ) ( indistinct chatter ) How's things? Getting terrible. Oh, go on. ( whimpering ) ( whimpering ) ( cat meowing ) MARK:I don't like it. It's only because you haven't eaten. It's just dark and dead dogs. It can't hurt you. Where are we going to bury it? Over there? No, they'll see us. ( yawning ) Here, here. They tell me you've been hanging around with my kids. And don't say you haven't, because they've seen you. And what about this note, eh? Eh? Oh. Now don't muck about. I asked you, where are they? Where are they? How did you find him? A fellow in a pub. Hey, what do you reckon to his story? Well, I seen him around. I'll tell you this. If anything's happened to my kids... If there's a spare plot in your cemetery, I'm going to bury him. Me-la-nie. Melanie. Come on, grandpa. On your way, sailor. Come on. I told you. People down there trying to sleep. I'll set her on you. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, now what? It's like burst veins. I can't stand up. I can't stand up. ( upbeat theme playing ) Hey, get off my bike! Nice night for a walk. DAD: Is this the place? POLICE: Come on, grandpa. UNDERTAKER: I'll just unlock the gates. Here, you look after her. Oh, you're worried about her now, eh? Look mate, if this is a wild goose chase... ( Sam mumbling indistinctly ) Come on, forget it. Wild geese, very tasty. I like a nice goose. It's the hair that keeps them warm. You must be lovely and cosy. Oh. Oh, what a stupid place for him to bring the kids. UNDERTAKER: Oh, he shouldn't have brought them in, in here. Honestly, when I get my hands on those two, I'll... Oh, I don't know. There's nothing more we can do here. Well, what about the note I left for them out there? Well, they could be lost anywhere. The park's a big place. No use hanging around here. POLICE: Anything? Nothing. What do you want to do? Looks as if he's settled in for the night. I'll stick around a bit just in case. If you could get a message to the wife. Do you want me to stay around? No, no, I'll be all right. I wish you joy of him. Oh, it's you, is it? What makes you think they're coming back? I don't think, mate. They're your kids, not mine. You're staying awake. I asked you something. You're very strong, aren't you? Very strong. Must be all that hard work you do. What for? People like you who bring kids into the world, don't know what they're all about. All you can say is, "No, no, you can't. " "No, don't do that. Don't do that, you can't. " You can. That's what it's all about, mate. You can. It's not filling their bellies up with the bread and butter. What about a bit of bread and butter up here? That's where they need it, you know. A little bit of the old glass ball. A bit of magic. A bit of dream boats going on in here. Tell a person like you that, I may as well tell them to clean their teeth with a whitewash brush. Now look here, if you interfere with my needs again, I'll give you a swift kick in the gobbles that'll bring tears to your eyes, twice nightly. All right. I'm throwing in the curtains and going to kip. ( Battersea barks ) ( upbeat theme playing ) Where the hell have you been? Come on. Your mum's worried sick about you. ( birds chirping ) ( tender theme playing ) Quick, catch up. They're getting away. When I grow up, I want to be a soldier. Why, you like fighting? No, I just want a horse.
