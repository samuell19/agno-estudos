Year 2013: Zombies evolve further The company boss, Yoshioka, comes to my room twice a week. He's breaking up with his strange wife. It's been 3 years since I believed that. I turned twenty-nine years old this year. Wait a second! - I'll go take a shower - Just like that? Sorry, I still have a bit of menstruation. Come on! When we started dating, just touching his ring hand... I felt a sense of superiority. Now... I just feel miserable. -Hey... -Hm? Take off the ring... Namiki got awarded by the system He's leaving the company next month. Oh, didn't he only join a year ago? Good guys like Namiki don't stay very long. Mustn't it be better than sitting in the company for 7 years? See you tomorrow. I'll be late for the train. Just 5 seconds. Are you done now? Goodnight. -Take me too! -Huh? I want to go to your wife now. What nonsense are you talking about? Wait, I'll be ready soon. Hey, what are you talking about? I'm serious. If you can't decide, I will make a decision with you and your wife. Airi, settle down. I am settled! You're the one who can't ever decide! What is it? I can't help it, I'm going to sleep tonight. Why? You're all worked up, I can't leave you alone like this. So say "Let's go together"! Let's do it one more time, huh? Put on your clothes! I'm going to your wife! Don't be loud!! Airi? Airi?! I can't believe it. -Sorry. -Don't touch me!! Our relationship I'll expose it to the company. Why is this...? ZOMBIE BRIDE Why...? I'm also going to expose it to our acquaintances. So... I was murdered? I'm dead? Yoshioka Calling mobile PHONE: "We're sorry, the number you have dialled is not in service at this time." His house knows. Didn't I go there to have a peek before? Honey! Honey? -Hm? -Give me the flowerpot there. Yes~ Yes~ I see. YOSHIOKA Excuse me, anybody home? Who are you? His wife? Uh... nice to meet you. I'm Narusawa. I'm an employee who works for Yoshioka at the company. So... Uh... I don't know how much you know. Me and him... it could be said... we're together. Am I going to be like that someday? If so, I should clean up my place right now. What should I say to my parents? My mom was always noisy saying,'Get married quickly so I can see your grandchildren...' Her only daughter was killed by an affair. If she hears I'm a zombie, she might be shocked... What a terrible dream... You like that? When I open my eyes, everything will be a dream. That's what I expected, but I still couldn't sleep. Dear Father and Mother... How are you? You won't be able to phone or email me for a while. I can't answer the phone or text, but don't worry about me. I wandered a few nights without a destination. The night I couldn't sleep was very long. What? Uh... You want to eat too? Are you new? When did you die? Just recently... That's right... raw meat is hard at the beginning. -Are you eating properly? -Yeah? If you don't eat it, your brain starts rotting in the blink of an eye. Then it becomes impossible to know what is what. What are you talking about? You don't know anything? So what if you die one day. Come to my house. This will make a good hamburger! But... There's no other place to go anyway. Come on. How long are you going to carry that over there? Just throw it everywhere. Yeah... When you die, your body starts rotting incredibly quickly. The only way to stop it is by eating human meat. -What about cows or pigs? -No. Well, if you're a cow or a pig... Yoko's Izakaya -Now, drink this. -Thank you. Have I asked you your name yet? I'm Airi Narusawa. I'm Yoko. This is my shop. But... you're a zombie? This is my home, too. It's a zombie pub for zombies. A zombie pub...? Okay. Yoko's Izakaya Madam Yoko So you were killed by an affair. What happened to that man? I just went straight home. I didn't go to work. How did it happen? Did you hang yourself? No, I wasn't home. It sounds bad. Are you running away? Sure... how long have you been a zombie? I'm already 3 years old. Really? I can't see that at all. Well, eating this stops the aging. Mm~ it's good! Eat up! Yeah... Come on, it's good! Just think of tofu. Hey It's so delicious with sauce~ Like it? It's delicious... Right?! Um... Huh? If we both died, why aren't we dead? I don't know the details, but in recent years I think this is happening all over the world. They say the cause is this and that, but actually, I don't think they really know. Well, what can we do about it? Yeah... Come on Eat before you rot away. Zombies like us aren't seen in public very often. Why do you think that is? How come? The bereaved families are traumatized by their faces. It's better to hide away. But it seems that there's a lot of them. Unknown to relatives and neighbors, some families even keep their zombies locked up in a room. Madam, today is a special catch. She was a pretty woman, I caught her this morning. Manabu, today's is really fresh. Try it. My husband who died a long time ago rode this. I don't know if it will still roll. Yoko, do you have an air pump? Well... I'll find it later. Please. You know... How did you die? My husband gave me a lot of domestic violence. He hit and kicked me every day without any changes Until one day he pushed me down the stairs, and that changed everything. What happened to your husband? After I died, we lived together for some time. Yeah? Really. But for the living ones, I think it's harder for them to live with a corpse. When the wife you killed turns white and becomes a zombie, it's like a curse. Soon after, he couldn't work anymore and became depressed. He cried every night saying, "Please kill me". It was kind of nice to see my husband like that. I thought, "This is the one who's been making me suffer so much". So... when he was sleeping, I snuck up to him and bit his neck. Then he looked straight at me and said one thing. "Thank you." Having lived with him for 15 years, I was surprised because I had never heard that before. Well, at least once in my lifetime there was something I wanted to hear. So for a few days I cried and ate my husband. Yeah? That was the birth of our restaurant's special stew. It's made with human meat. Yoshioka My wife... Yoko's Izakaya Hey, I haven't been here in a while. That's a pretty girl, did you hire her? Isn't she pretty? That's Airi. Madam, please introduce me to Ai-chan. Can't you just make a bad joke? Because this is my first time selling water. I got it. I'm a gentleman in front of a beauty. -And where is this gentleman? -As I said, "In front of a beauty". What's that supposed to mean?! -Hey, Airi! -Yeah? This is Maekawa. He's a strange customer coming to our store as a regular. Nice to meet you. I'm Airi. Airi-chan, isn't this aunt envious? Watch it! Sorry, I guess I'm doing everything too well. Then I'm glad. By the way, you're really pretty. It's too bad that you're a corpse. Welcome! Welcome. Airi, be careful if you're a beauty. He's a man who flirts regardless of whether you're living or dead. Here. What is it? Oh, nothing... But Maekawa, you're still alive. Why are you coming to this store? Me? I'm working to help people like you. What do you do? Even if you're a bold zombie, like Madam here, you can't just procure your own food. I'm running my feet off to feed zombies. Is that so? You can't just go to a nearby supermarket to buy this meat, right? Miura, it's been a long time. How are you? I visited her again today. So? What's her status? There was considerable corruption. Did you feed her this? You gave me a beef jerky. She didn't eat it. I see. The house is also a mess and her husband has been around for quite some time. I don't know when I'll be able to go back. Ai-chan, will you go hunting with me later? -Hunting? -It's okay, it's easy once you get used to it. There's nothing to be afraid of. It's just like fishing. But... Ai-chan, all creatures in this world are supposed to take the lives of other creatures. I think human beings are so arrogant. They take away tens of thousands of lives every day, but the subject of eating the remains is taboo. They only allow trimmed fish and animal meat to be packed in packets and sold in stores. There is never any gratitude for life. Surely God is going to punish such foolish human beings by making zombies. Humans have to be in the position of being eaten by others. Only then will they learn to appreciate life. Ah sorry, sorry, I'm getting old. Whatever you say, it becomes like a sermon. It's okay. Yoko's Izakaya Thanks to you, we'll get more customers in no time! It's a lot of fun. Didn't you go with Maekawa? I told him I'd go hunting with him next time. His erotic inspiration. He's still a good person, right? He's just an unusual person. But why does he hang around here so much if he's alive? I talked to you lots today. Who was the customer you talked to? Why? No reason, I'm just wondering. He was also made a zombie because of an affair. I see... Originally, he was working as a salesman selling cosmetics. He was sleeping with another man's wife. When he was pretending to have things to sell, there was one house he visited frequently to rendezvous with his secret lover. But when he visited one day, he found that she had become a zombie. Wife? Why did the wife become a zombie? It's the same as me. She was killed by her husband. Still, even though she became a zombie, Miura loves her so much. He still meets her these days. But for the wife... it was a big shock to see that she had made a zombie out of Miura. He says she hasn't eaten anything since -So she's just rotting away. -Eat it. Now she doesn't even remember who Miura is. Yes... Chew it hard! You're doing well! So Yoshioka killed his wife too. How long has it been since then? Not long ago, I went to your house. What? On Sunday, when your wife was watering the garden. Why did you do that? That's... I wanted to see who she was. Listen carefully. Don't do that again, okay? Okay. Instead, do to me a lot of things you can't normally do to your wife. Airi, here. Thank you. -Good work. -Thanks. There were a lot of customers today. I know, right? -Hey, Yoko. -Hm? Yoko-san, is there anything you want to do? What do you mean? Maybe something you couldn't do while you were alive? I suppose... Yeah, my husband has already been punished. Ah! I once wanted to go to Egypt to see the pyramids. But I can't get a passport as a zombie. How about you? I'm going to get married after all. I wanted to have a child... Well, there might be something you can do about that. Oh? Well, by law, marriage between zombies is impossible, although there are quite a few zombie couples who are actually married. It is said that there are zombie couples who made children in other countries. Really? Why don't you show your grandchild's face to your parents too? If a daughter who becomes a zombie takes her husband and child who are also zombies to meet her parents, don't you think they would be surprised? -Oh, I thought of something! -Yeah? What's left in my mind. -Should I hold it properly? Can you let go? -It's okay! Move slowly. Go on. One, two... It's surprising that your motor functions seem to be good. I can't just ride a bike! Yeah, yeah. Ready to go again? -Should I hold it as well? -I've got it again. One, two... You're bending the handle in the direction that you think you're going to fall. I can't do it, I'm scared. Okay, let's try again. Yoko, you're riding, you're riding! Ouch... Really... are you okay? Yoko, can you wake up? Is that okay? Why I didn't get it right?! I'm sorry... Yoko, your eye popped out. -Will you be okay for a second? -Yeah. What happened to your face? I practiced biking during the day with Yoko. Huh? Did Yoko get on a bike? That's surprising. Right? With how badly Airi teaches, my eye popped out! -Yoko? -Hm? -I keep thinking about something. -Hm. -Is the store only busy at night? -Yeah. -I was wondering if I could do something during the day. -Oh. For example? The hamburgers you make are so delicious. What if I make hamburgers and sell them during the day? But I have to prepare to open the store at night. Oh, I don't mind selling them myself. I can get on your bike and cycle around. If there's nothing left in the store at night, you have nothing to throw away. Keep it up and you could take my job! [Hamburger 300 yen, made only with magic meat] Oh~ that's very good. Then I'll go. Bye! Be careful! Strange... How about a delicious hamburger made of magic meat? How about a delicious hamburger made of magic meat? How about a delicious hamburger made of magic meat? How about a delicious hamburger made of magic meat? How about a delicious hamburger made of magic meat? Excuse me. Oh, welcome. Would you like one? Can you say it like you eat this? Huh? It says it's magical meat. Oh, yes! Its anti-aging effect is perfect! It's 300 yen. I got 300 yen. Enjoy. Thank you. You've been around a lot. I'm sure it's going to be difficult, but keep your spirits up. It's 300 yen. I got 300 yen. That's 200 change. It's 600 yen for two. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! How is it? Hm. Definitely delicious. Maekawa, will you take me hunting afterwards? Huh? What wind is blowing suddenly? This... is selling so well, I need to get meat for the ingredients. What the heck? You've changed a lot. I thought that the story you told me was really right. Well, I'm glad you think so. Are you finding it pretty good? What are you talking about? I was making a date with Airi-chan, right? Yeah. H... Hun... Cola... I want it every time... Manabu, you can speak now?! I'm so glad! Okay? Today is your first time, so I'll support you. Yes. First of all, I'm going to take them down like this. Then you will come and pull them like this. Give that to me. If you slit the neck like this, there's no blood splashing on you. How's that? Yeah. You don't have to be so nervous! Relax, relax! Yeah. There it is! He's going to die, but that's alright. Okay? I know I'm good at what I said earlier, but I don't know about you. Just stay calm and ready! Okay. Listen. Shall we go? Hello. Goodbye! Don't! Airi-chan?! Why... Yoshioka... Airi. What happened? I'm fine. But... this man is hurt. The medicine box is on the shelf there. Thank you... I'll do some bike practice then. -Yoko -Hm? Thank you. I thought about dying after I killed you. But I couldn't die, I just wandered every day. Did you kill your wife? I went to your house to find you. My wife found out about us six months ago. I had a fight with her. We struggled, and... I strangled her. Like what you did to me. The wife that should have died will rot little by little every day. I thought it would just be my mind. But I can't tell anyone about it. I kept hiding with you. But... you... You started asking to meet my wife. So... So you killed me too? I don't deserve to live anymore. What has already happened I have no control over. Are you forgiving me? If you can hold me like this... Why did you do that?! I... I think that I'm an independent zombie now. Now you will also become one. Go back home and live with your wife for the rest of your life. That's the atonement you have to do. Why are you back all of a sudden?! I went on a trip. Once I've sorted my thoughts out, I'll stop by my parents. I'm just going to be honest about everything that's happened. Yoko-san said that it was a good decision. I've gained a lot of attention so far. Eat this on the way. Thank you... I'll be lonely without you. I'll definitely come back. When you come back, bring your husband and child with you. Okay. I'll do my best to keep the store going strong until you return. With one death, everything was reborn. Madam? Madam? Oh... Sorry. You were thinking about Airi-chan? Ever since she left. Are you okay? You always have me. I'm tired of men. Madam... Will you marry me? It's a little sudden. What? Are you kidding? I'm not joking. Until now, I was patient because I was a human being. But thanks to Airi-chan, I decided that now is the time. Are you stupid? It suits you! What's your name? Kenji. Kenji-kun. Are you hungry? I'll give you something good. Is it difficult to eat raw fresh meat for the first time? This... I've been trying to buy sashimi or something since I died. I feel like something new is starting now. And it's the best I've ever felt. English subtitles by Kon2805 on Letterboxd
