And it's these guys from the Bay Area, three guys making such a fucking racket, and the weirdest music I've ever heard. And I just thought, "This is fucking great, I love this band, I gotta listen to this shit forever." And they quickly became my favorite band, they still are. Their name's Primus if you haven't figured it out. And... [ Cheers and applause ] [ Chuckles ] So a few years later, me and Trey make it to Hollywood and we get a TV show pilot. So we looked up Primus' management company in the phone book and sent them a letter and sent them a copy of "The Spirit of Christmas." And it worked. And here we are. I'm standing here with a felt fish on my head. So anyway, we got this letter at the office that said, "Hey, these guys fresh out of college have made this cartoon, they're big Primus fans, and they really want you to do this thing. They have $74 to spend." And they said, you know, "Hey, you want to do this thing?" And we thought, "Well, you know..." And we watched "The Spirit of Christmas", we thought, "That's fucking amazing. That's unbelievable, that's incredible. We're gonna do it." We didn't do it for the money. We did it because we thought it was an amazing thing. [ Cheering ] So a few... about a month later, we get something in the mail, and here it is. This is what we got from these guys. First shot. [ Theme song plays ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Cheers and applause ] So the first thing we thought was, "Wow, that's fucking amazing, we got our own Primus song." And second thing we thought was, "That's a minute and 40 seconds. That's not an intro theme song. That's way too fucking long." Yeah, so what they did is, they said, you know, "Comedy Central... " they passed the buck right on to their bosses. They said, "Comedy Central says it's too slow, it needs to be a little zippa-dee-doo, a little peppier. Can you guys re-record it?" And, you know, we're out there traveling the world, doing our thing, you know, making that magic. And we're like, "You know, come on, dude, you gave us $74, we're not going to go back in and re-record this thing. How about you just take it and you just speed it up?" Yeah, so we sped it up in Pro Tools. We crammed it down really fast, but when you do that with digital Pro Tools, the voice kind of breaks, so we had to go back and ask Les, "Please, can you re-record your voice?" He was psyched about that, he was super psyched. Which we did backstage. You sent one of your friends, we recorded backstage at Fiddler's Green. That's true. In Colorado, on tour.

It is quite possibly the funniest joke ever conceived, and its origin is unknown. The fishsticks joke crosses all borders, all races, all ages and ethnic groups, and is slowly uniting our country. In fact, the only person who appears to not get the joke is rapper Kanye West, who becomes furious when people use the joke on him. Snyder: You ready don't get it? Hey, man, I'm a genius, alright?! If I was a homosexual or a fish, I would know! Now let's see. Somethin' about fishsticks interacting with me makes me a gay fish. Kanye, really. Alright, now what do we know about fishsticks? They're breaded, they're fried, they're frozen. Then under me, we have rapper, genius. And gay fish are homosexual. They swim. Is it because breaded has something to do with genius, which swims? No, because you said you like fish sticks, Kanye! Don't... Don't you get it? You see, "fish-dicks" is a... is a play on words. I don't need anyone tellin' me "play on words"!
