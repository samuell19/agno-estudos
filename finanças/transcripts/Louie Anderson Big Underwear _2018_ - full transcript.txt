Here we go. Let's see how strong these guys are. ♪ Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Louie Anderson! ♪ Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Please sit down. Shouldn't every day start like that? I mean, you come down for breakfast, the applause, "Ahh, he's here. Oh, God, he's here. There's toast! There's--" Every time you come back in the kitchen they, "Oh! There's coffee! Let's have it out. There's flavored creamer." When did they start flavoring the creamer? It just happened one day. "Hazelnut? I don't think so." Then they got worse with it. "Caramel 'macicaca'? Is that caramel macicaca? That sounds like me. I love a little caramel macicaca." And you don't think it-- you know, I was off it for a long time. I gotta be honest with ya. I was off the whole thing. I was--turned into my dad. "I don't want any of that creamer crap. I just want-- I like a little spoiled milk in mine for God's sakes. You got any buttermilk? Can I throw a little buttermilk? Don't throw the spoiled milk out. I'm using it now as a creamer. And a face cream. I gotta..." And then one day, I don't know, I was weak. Tired. I just put a little flavored creamer. Then I turned into a cat. It's fun to watch cats clean themselves. I'm gonna start cleaning myself like that. Cats love fat people, my. You show up at somebody's house and they got a cat, they're right over there doing the elliptical on ya. "Hey, fatty. How are you?" Oh, what a beautiful day, wasn't it? You know, if you're bummed out. Something must be wrong with me 'cause when it's overcast I go, "Oh, that's better. That's better." I like it. I just go right into it. I turn into my dad. "You all right?" So funny. Everywhere I fly to, you know what? If it's raining, this is my favorite thing. "We need the rain." No matter where I go. "We need the rain. We needed the rain. I know it flooded, but we needed it. We need the rain. The farmers needed the rain." They'll throw that in, too. "The farmers... need it." Like you knew-- Like, "How do you know that?" "I know. I'm tied into agriculture. Farmers need it. I like the rain." "Get out." You know where they don't need the rain? On that show Naked and Afraid. It's always raining. "We're trying to start a fire. Can I use some of your hair, God damnit? Let me use some of your hair to start the fire. Come on. Come on, Janet! I've already seen your breasts." I like how they fuzz it all out. Depending-- And they fuzz it out depending on what they're fuzzing out. How big it is, how small they are. And then sometimes you just go, "What? Who thought of this? Some sick-o thought of this show." Naked and Afraid. They raise their-- What do they call it... when they-- they're outside activity rate or something? They're "survival capacity." We live in L.A.! Survival capacity. You ever spent nine hours in a car? Yeah, Naked and Afraid. I'm naked and afraid every time I get ready for bed. You ever catch a glimpse of yourself naked in the hall mirror? "Jesus... is that my butt? I'm sure I could get a selfie of that. That should be in the Museum of Modern Art that butt." Man, I travel everywhere. Been on the road all year. I get used to it. I go home I go, "I gotta get out of here." I live in Florida. And, you know, I started in Florida. If you've been to Florida... in the summer... It's horrible. It's horrible. It's so hot. Your sweat has sweat. Your sweat... That's how the accent started. "How you doin'?" "Pretty good. How you doing?" "Not bad." "You seen Mama?" "Mm." Even the big hound dog on the porch, "Ba. Ba. Ba!" It's so hot even the gators are going, "We gotta get outta here. We gotta head up to Tampa." I was up in Oregon-- or "Ore-gone" or "organ." I was corrected every time. "It's Oregon." "That's what I'm saying." "It's 'organ.'" "'Ore-gone,' organ. Origami." Wilderness up there, man. Ooh. Nice to stay at a hotel where you can hunt from the window. Texas. Then I went to Texas. I was all over. Texas. You ever been to Texas? You can carry a gun down there. It shocks ya. You know, you're in 7-Eleven, the guy's got the gun, you go, "Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What's that?" And then you realize, "Oh, they all have guns. Oh, that's--" Ah, even the homeless guy. "What?" Watch it. I'm uncomfortable around guns. I don't have one. I don't have a gun. I got a piece of candy in my pocket. I got a licorice gun on you right now. I went and saw the Alamo. Have you seen the Alamo? Yeah, I was so disappointed. Mrs. Stelsnik made that thing a big deal in my life in 3rd grade and I got there and I go, "Is this it? Is this the whole thing? Was there a fire here once?" I'm pretty sure I could hold this thing for a couple days. You know, you have to turn it sideways so you can see it. Then I went and bought the little Alamo 'cause you buy-- Not for me. I don't buy this stuff for me. I wanna buy it, but I buy it for other people so I don't have to have it. That's a--That's a compulsive collector's trick. "I'll get it for Janet. She loves trinkets." So I buy the little Alamo across the street. Almost same size. I set it down, people started lining up in front of it. Made 11 bucks. You collect stuff? I'm a collector. A lot of people collect different things. Anybody collect anything? Yeah? What do you collect, huh? Thank you. I didn't hear it. I don't know what it was, but... In Boston-- I went up to Boston, and, uh, I went in this house. You know, 'cause people invite-- Hey, they want celebrities over their house for some reason. I wouldn't, but they want 'em over. You know, they-- No, I'm just being nice to whoever booked the show and then I go to the thing. So, I go to the people's house and then you just walk in-- You ever walk into a house that they collected for too long? Huh? "Oh, someone likes elephants. Someone loves an elephant." It's true, man. And you just stand there, and you say to your friend, "We gotta get outta here. We have got to go." Man, and then they say, "I got 1,100 elephants." "Yeah... it's fabulous." "Wanna see the first one I ever collected?" "Do I?!" I stayed at one house of some friends and I didn't know they had dolls. They had a room full of dolls. I was staying in it. They showed me the room. They opened the door, "You'll be in this room." All the dolls had the same teeth as me. And just like me, when you lay 'em down, their eyes close. Did you ever stay at someone's house and they are trying to say it's a bed that you're gonna sleep on? "It's a daybed." "Well, it's night right now, though." "The cat sleeps on it." "Not tonight. The cat doesn't sleep on it." I couldn't go to sleep. The dolls were all-- I had to finally-- I finally had to bring 'em all in the bed and lay 'em all down to get their eyes to close. Yeah, I used to collect stuff all the time then. Then you see the storage bill. "What the hell? What the hell do I have in there?" You don't know what you have in there and you don't want to go in. Okay, and then you agree. People are-- You know... the people that love you, the people around you go, "We're gonna get rid of the storage stuff." "I guess." It was a good feeling to get rid of it all, but when I was going through it I realized something about myself. I'm an underwear hoarder. I opened several boxes and I go, "Underwear." And I took 'em out, and you go, "Geez, are these mine?" You don't realize how big your underwear because you're not thinking about 'em when you're putting 'em on, but when you hold 'em like this... and it blocks the sun, you-- You say out loud, "Are these mine?! Why didn't someone mention this?!" "We have. You just ignore it." No one wants the underwear, either. I tried to give it away. Six big boxes of nice underwear. I don't know. I don't know, over the decades, too. I had some '70s, '80s... '90s. And then I skipped two years. I don't know what happened. It was so funny. And nobody, like, took 'em to Goodwill. "We don't-- We can't take them." "What?" "It's unsanitary." "They're clean!" "We can't take 'em." And I'm thinking, Can't take 'em? Why didn't you tell me before I hauled 'em all in here? I could just leave 'em and go." "Louie Anderson arrested today for leaving underwear at Goodwill." "Oh, he's a sick-o. He's a sick-o. He left six boxes of underwear." I felt bad because I know. I was poor once. And so people-- I didn't have-- I think the reason I had so many underwear is 'cause we only had a couple of underwear growing-- You know, like, I had like two, three pair growing up when you're poor. And my mom would wash 'em every two or three days. And so I think when I'd go shopping, I'd go, "I better get some more underwear." 'Cause when you're a kid, you're traumatized by that kind of stuff. "How are ya?" "I hardly have any underwear." "I think I'm out." So, they wouldn't do it. I thought about stopping at-- I saw a couple of people who look like they could use some underwear. You've seen 'em on the street and you go, "That guy, I don't think he's got any underwear on." And I said, "I'm gonna--" And then I played it out in my head. I go, "Don't do it. Don't do it. Keep driving, Louie. Keep driving." So I'm making artwork out of 'em now. Yeah. Celebrity-- Hey, that's how you-- The people love celebrity stuff for some reason. So I make-- I take underwear... And I dip 'em in polyurethane... and I put 'em over a big, wooden sphere thing-- "Sphere." Isn't that the-- Like, I'd hate to have to spell that. I don't think I can ever get it right. So I put it over the sphere, then when it hardens, I cover the legs-- 'cause they're boxer briefs, and-- You know? And then I cover the top-- Well, that's what they are. They're boxer briefs. I don't want it riding up. I need something-- I gotta have... I can't have a G-string by the end of the walk. So I cover the top, cover the legs, then I decorate 'em with holly. That's right. I make holiday nut bowls out of 'em. That's right. I sell 'em-- I sell 'em on my website and all the money goes to people who need underwear. You know holidays are boring. Imagine going to a--you know, Christmas, very boring. I mean, it's okay for the first couple hours and then you go, "I gotta get outta here." You go over there guy goes, "What's that?" "That's my, uh... Louie Anderson Holiday Nut Bowl." "What?" "It's signed right there. It's 1 of 250." "What?! Well, how do you get the nuts out?" "You gotta go in through the front." I collect lighters when I smoked. I used to to collect Zippo lighters. And then, you know, I quit smoking I go, "What the hell was I thinking?" I wish I had 'em when I was a kid. I always wanted a lighter 'cause my sisters-- You know, I have five sisters. Love 'em, Mary, Rhea, Lisa, Sheila, and Shanna. And they would-- they had hairspray. Cans this high. It was like a-- Aqua Net I think it was. They'd spray-- Remember it? And if you had a lighter, you could... Get back! 'Cause I had five brothers, too. Kent, Rodger, Billy, Jimmy, and Tommy. So, you know, you need a-- 'Cause if you're-- if you're--I'm 10th of 11... so I was getting punched occasionally. You know? Zippo, Aqua Net... Get back! I'm Thor! I'm Aqua Thor! I'm Aqua Net. My parent's collected kids, obviously. I was 10th of 11. I just slid out. I was home from the hospital before my mom was. I was there. I was at the door, "I'm starving!" I'm sorry, Mom. My mom would hate that joke. "Louie... that's bad." "Funny though, right, Ma?" How many grew up poor? Did you guys... 'Cause, you know, I was in there. I was in there too long, you know? I was just in my mom. I was just-- "I gotta get outta here." That's what you do. Man, ten kids. I was tenth. Then they had another one. I guess they were trying to get it right. Grew up very poor. Didn't have money. We had to pick a lot of times what we were gonna shut off, the lights or the gas. Usually the... we'd shut off the lights 'cause my mom had 1,000 candles she stole from the church. We'd have a séance in the afternoon. "Join hands." One time she brought a menorah in all seven candles lit. "I don't think that's right, Ma." "It's okay. I know some Jews, Louie." We were so poor. One time, you know, I didn't have any money to get my mom a birthday gift and I--you know I wrote a coupon book. You know? "I'll wash the dishes... I'll do the laundry... I'll kill Dad for you." You know? "Louie, that was a very sweet gift. But one of those coupon books, you know, they were inappropriate." "What? The dishes one?" "No." "What?" "You wouldn't really kill your father, would you?" "I'd do it for you, Ma. There's no expiration date on that coupon." Thank you. It's true. I used to get so mad at my dad. You know, I inherited things from him, though. You inherit it. No money. I inherited this sound from him... I inherited this disapproving look... This sound... Ha! I inherited this from my mom... - "You all right, Mom?" - "I guess." My mom was real passive aggressive. She was very funny, though. You know, you'd park somewhere. She'd go... "Oh, you're gonna... Are you gonna park here?" "Well, I could try and get closer." "Oh, it's okay. I guess I could walk from here." And my dad, you know, he didn't really like people. My dad was a, "I hate that guy!" Somebody would come and he'd go, "Oh, I hate that guy." "Do you know him?" "I don't need to know him to hate him!" Wow. I love my parents. I miss 'em, you know? I don't want 'em back, don't get me wrong. I learned about all that, you know, family and stuff when I did the "Family Feud." I learned a lot about families 'cause families like-- it's hard to find five in a family... that are functional. It's really-- It's rough. They'd inter--Listen, thousands of people would audition and they would... "Eh..." You know, and as I would go down the thing, the first one would be the husband or wife all into it. The next one... And then sometimes the third was the son. He would do pretty good. Then you get to the cousin... "How you doing?" "What? Is it my turn? Chocolate." It was just so funny 'cause they go, "Oh, it's hard. It's hard." My family even played it. We lost. I froze up. I got in there I go-- They said, "Name... your favorite place in the house." "The garage?" And then the answer was "bed." I should've had that! I'm always in my bed! As my dad once said, "Louie... you're the laziest human being on Earth." "Well, thank you, Father." "It's not a compliment!" Then my mom--the greatest person in the world, goes, "Well, Andy, you did say world." You just turn into those guys. You try to refine it. Make it better, but you just turn into 'em. You just... You know? I did my DNA test, right? I'm 20 % alcohol and 80 % butter. My dad was--I didn't get the drunk gene. I got the butter gene. And if you do love butter, don't wear jeans. That's one thing fat people should never wear. Jeans. I've never looked at a fat person and went, "Nice." I'd always thought to myself, "Oh, God, if--I am never gonna wear..." But you get tricked into jeans 'cause the guy goes, "Those look slimming on you." "Do they?" I got the fat gene. I love food. My mom loved food. You know, my mom just-- she thought food was the greatest thing. You know, should could make a saltine cracker look like a van Gogh painting. She loved butter. She loved food. I love food, you know? But now, you know... I have a lot of memories of food. That's bad. I don't have memories of my childhood, but I have memories of my childhood food. "Remember that licorice thing you used to make? It was in a red silver dollar thing? You'd stuff 'em all in your mouth. McDonald's. I remember when I first had my first McDonald's. It was 12 cents for a burger. Eight cents for fries. We pulled the covered wagon up, "Hold on there! What you want, Mama?" "I'll just have some fries." The fries back then, huh? Remember when they used to fry the French fries in that transgender fat? I know I'm gonna get in trouble for that one. I have a couple transgender friends and they laughed. They didn't want to, but they knew it was good. They liked that. Remember the trans fat? That's what it was called. Ooh, man. You couldn't even eat they were so hot. You'd hover them in your mouth. "Jesus. God." Get me some ketchup!" You could bring someone out of a coma with those fries. "Is he still out? Put these by his nose. Billy! Can you hear me, Billy? Put 'em closer to his nose. Billy!" ♪ "I'm lovin' it." "He's back!" I wish I could sell my fat to McDonald's... for the fries. Just pull up there like a cartoon and then, "How are the fries?" "They taste funny. They're killing me." That's one for me. That's a joke I like. Oh, I feel old telling a joke like, when I say, "When I was a kid there were..." I don't know why I'm throwing that accent in, but... You know when else you feel old? You know when you really feel old? You're on the Internet and they go, "Put the year you were born in." "Oh..." I'm stuck in the '60s! You know, and you're reading it. You know, the 2000s... the '90s, the '80s... the '70s-- "Oh, let me take a break." I don't like going to Walgreens for that. "Can you give us your birth date?" "Um... "Could you speak up?" "Three, ... I don't even want the medicine. Never mind." You gotta embrace your family, though. You gotta know what it's all about so you can work on all this stuff, you know? Our family is drinking, eating, smoking. I quit smoking 15 years ago. Now I'm trying to quit eating, but I can't keep... smoking the food. I wanna be healthy. Everybody wants to be healthy, don't they? That's what people want. They wanna be healthy. I mean, to what degree, I don't know, but people wanna be healthy. Yeah. You know, you wake up in the morning, you go-- Cause people out there-- I know, a lot of people think fat people get up in the morning and go, "I'm gonna lay around and eat all day." It's just the opposite. "I'm gonna get up, I'm gonna work out, I'm gonna eat well-- Wait, is it Sunday, though? Shouldn't start something like that on a Sunday." I got a Fitbit, huh? Let's see how I'm doing, shall we? Let's see... Nine hundred and fifty two steps? Oh, that's the time. Hold on a second. Here's the steps. Here's the... Four. Four steps. Four. You have to be careful of people who are really healthy seeing your Fitbit. "How many steps you got there?" "Eh... What?" "Is that a Fitbit?" "A 'Fatbit.'" "How many steps you got?" "I got, uh, let's see... Sixty eight hundred." "Let me check mine. Eighteen thousand. "I will kill you." And at that moment you know what I'm thinking? "I gotta get this thing on the dog. I gotta--" Get it on the dog. You know, that's the thing, and you wish you could run into that person after you had it on the dog. "Hey! How you doing? Is that your Fitbit? How you doing? Ended up with 28,000. How about you?" "35,000." "What?" "I was at the park. I was chasing a cat." That's right. Anyways, I think it should go according to weight. At my weight, I should get three steps for every one. That's how I feel. I have a friend help me being healthier. Do you have those friends? "Louie, I'm gonna help you out here. Louie, I'm gonna turn you around." "Well, you better bring another person." The truth, she brings me stuff. "I brought you a kale shake." Kale gives me the shakes. Kale... when did that become big? It used to be a garnish in the '60s. "Louie, I wish you'd take it all seriously." "I do." "Aren't you worried about pesticides?" We used to run behind the mosquito spraying trucks when I was a kid. No one cared. We'd go home. "Where were you?" "We were running behind the mosquito spray trucks. Now my head feels funny... and Gilbert's in a coma." And my dad would say, "Sounds like you had a terrific time." "Thank you, Father." "Louie..." That's what my dad always-- "Louie!" She loves me, though. She's a very nice person. She's determined. "Eat organic at least, will you, Louie?" "Eh, sure." You ever go shopping for organic? "How much are the organic bananas?" "They're 2.99 a pound." "How much are the other bananas?" "They're free." "Free?" "No one wants 'em." "Can I get some free bananas and some 'organic' stickers?" "Is the chicken free range?" "What does that even mean?" "It means they get to run free, Louie! Before they kill 'em." That seems crueler to me. The chickens in the coup are trying to warn her. "You're living a lie, Betty!" "Not me! I'm free range!" "They're trying to kill you, Betty!" "You're just jealous 'cause I'm a big free range chicken." We were free range. As long as we got home by 11, we could go anywhere. Go to Mexico and back. "Where were you?" "Went to Mexico. I got a piñata. And Gilbert came out of his coma." "Ah, world travelers, huh?" Love you, Dad. I'm gonna sit down for a minute. My knees hurt 'cause... ...they're made for smaller model. My friends said, "Why don't you get some medical marijuana?" I go bec--Yeah, there we go. Medical marijuana, that's me, you know? And I said, "Because I don't need another reason to be hungry." That's why. It's legal now in Nevada, man. Can you imagine being at the Crap table with that guy? I hope they legalize it everywhere because... my dad drank, you know? And, you know, maybe he would've been, like, more mellow, right? You never hear of anybody getting high on marijuana and going, "Let's blow something up." "What do you mean? Like a balloon?" "No, I can't do it. I can't." It's gonna be legal everywhere pretty soon, I'm telling ya. Why not? Why not? People say, "it leads to other drugs." Nah, I think if people are gonna go there, they're gonna go there, you know? Traffic's gonna get worse. That's the only bad thing. A four-way stop? Imagine that. "Go ahead. Go! Go ahead. Go. Go ahead. Go. Go. He won't go." "Go. Go, no, go. Go. No. Go! Don't do it. Wait. He went. I'm not doing it. Do it. Go. Why won't he go? Oh, that's pretty." I never was big on smoking marijuana, you know? It wasn't about the marijuana, it was the guy that rolled the joint that creeped me out. "Here you go, Louie." "That thing'll never light." The worst! It was the worst. You know the guy. He did it every time. Let it go around a while. Oh, a lot of my Basketfriends are here. A lot of my other friends are here. My family's here. What up? Be nice to your parents. You know, if they're still around. Give 'em a call when you're outta here. You know? I don't care how late it is. "Dad, I love ya." "What?! Here's your mother. He says he loves me. Find out what's wrong." Be nice to 'em. They don't mean it. They just... they got set in their ways like you're set in your ways. You know you're set in your ways. Stubborn. I ask you, are you a moveable or an immoveable object? I don't want an answer, but now you're-- Listen, think about that like I have... for a week. "Am I moveable or unmovable? I think I might be a moveable. I'd like to have people move me around." But I think people just get stuck. I know I do. I waited until I was 64 to start eating healthy. I figured, "Man, if I could still--" You know, my heart, I just go, "Thank you, heart. I love you." You know, plus, I've already eaten every single thing, so... You know? Every single thing. Everything. People will say to me, "Did you have that?" "I had that before anyone had that." I ate that in the '60s. I was putting Fritos in my Sloppy Joes in the '60s. All right, Taco Bell? Who doesn't want a Crunchwrap? First of all, it looks like my grandma's old, leather coin purse. "Grandma!" I love you guys. Watch Basketson Tuesdays. It's a lot of fun. I got Amazon Prime. Don't do it. I gotta hide boxes that show up. I got no idea what's in 'em. You know? And then, you know, you think, like, "I've ordered some stuff," and then it shows up in your feed. You know, you're looking at Facebook, and suddenly sparkly shoes come up. I just looked at 'em once for God's sakes. Big underwear? One time in my feed-- I'm pretty-- I can ignore stuff, but three pair of boxer briefs... for under ten bucks. I-I shot right over to Prime. I go, "They can't have 'em in my size. Ah! Manatee." I love those, man. That's my spirit animal. Those big manatees. "Propeller!" So I order 'em. Ten bucks. Three pair. I get 'em. I open 'em up. I go, "This can't be them." The bag, you know, was like an envelope. I just go, "This can't be three pair of big underwear." Open it up. "Where are these fr-- Korea. Oh, for God's sakes." I'm working really hard 'cause I need a goal. I can't wait until I can get into those. I put 'em on my doll and, um... Game of Thronesalmost over. I was hoping they'd go a couple more years. You know? That stuff on there. I never think about killing people till I watch that show. "Kill him! I don't care if he's ten! I want him dead!" I could never live back there. The mud alone... When I watch it I got a big hand pump sanitizer going. Will someone wipe his neck off?!" I'd have to be from the House Swifter. We're living in the greatest time, though. I'm really lucky. Yeah, we are really. We're living in the greatest time. Don't kid yourself, it's the best of time, and it's the worst of times. But I've gotten to see all this stuff, you know? The big, old, you know, cell phones. When it was like a brick and now, you know, and all the technology. And I can talk to you, you know, without talking to you. I just, "Hey, how are you? That's it. Don't text me back. I just wanted to know how you are. How are you?" And don't judge me for my one-thumb texting. It's an old person's thing. "Oh, I sent it too soon." I got an iPhone 6. I was thinking about an 8 or 10, but I'm only qualified for a 2. I swear to you, when they put out a new phone, they sabotage whatever you have. "Hey, this is gonna slow up right now. Welcome to the winding, slow river of Internet." "Hey, my phone just went out in the middle of a conversation." "Reboot it." You know, I have a phone friend. You always-- You know, the Obi-Phone Kenobi. The guy who can fix your phone for you? "Obiphone!" You know, you have to do that face from Oliver." "Sir... some help, sir? Some help, Obi-Phone Kenobi. Please help, sir. If it's not too much to ask. 'Ello, Gov'na!" And then they take it and they turn it into, like, Darth Vader. Oh, God. I'm gonna kill you, Louie." - "What?" - "Look at it. Look at it!" And you have to act serious 'cause they're not gonna fix your phone unless you do. "What is it?" You get this fa--look. "What I do? What'd I do?" "What'd I do? Huh?" I got a real good dumb face. "What was--" "You think this is funny, Louie?" "No, no, no, no." "Yeah, you got every damn thing open on here!" "Do I? Everything's open? I didn't know I had to close up Amazon Prime when I left." I didn't know. I didn't know. I didn't know things were open the first time this happened. "Everything's open, Louie." "So sorry." Then they shame you. "You got this open! You got big underwear. What? You got this open! Dairy Queen finder, really, Louie?!" I love a Dilly Bar. "You got that open, that's open... Weight Watchers. Really Louie? When's the last time you backed this up?" "What?" "Do you even know how to back it up, Louie?" As long as they fix your phone. That's all you care. "I was gonna get the 10, then I went down to the 8." I go, "I'm keeping my 6." Till the--I'm gonna wait till the 20 comes out. Huh? I'm waiting for the phone where you hit the thing on Yelp and a burger comes through it. "Thank you, Yelp. Five stars." I always think of my parents. My mom would've said about Trump, "Hmm... He's a blowhard." That's the kind of word she would throw out. "What?" "He is, Louie. I'd like to talk to him for a couple minutes and straighten him out." "All right, Ma."
