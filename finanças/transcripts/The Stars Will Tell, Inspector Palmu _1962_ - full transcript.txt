If that happened in Copenhagen, it would be a crime! Well, he is from the crime division. IT'S IN THE STARS, INSPECTOR PALMU Based on a novel by Mika Waltari Turva, come here at once! You naughty dog! Now, don't wake that man up! Is this the police? There's a body in here. A dead man, some drunkard. At the Palace Hotel. That is, I'm at the hotel. The body is at Observatory Hill. I'm sorry. You'll recognize me. I'm wearing a hat and a coat. Thank you. - Here already? - Modern times. Step in, please. Let's get in, Turva. - Where's the body at? - He's in the police choir. And he became a father an hour ago. Where art we going? Sorry for interrupting. I'd just like to explain - - why everything started out under such unlucky stars. At first, all went well. The police found the victim... - Dead as a doornail. - Killed. The crime division! Misfortune seldom comes alone, says the proverb. In this case it came with a camera. It's bad enough that a reporter came before the crime division. But that it should be the worst one in Helsinki, nay - - in Northern Europe, is nothing but cruelest irony. What's this, then? Nopsanen, Evening News, thank you. - Yes, but... - Nice photo. What killed him? Lightning? Hardly. Fight over a girl? Too old. Maybe wine? No, too clean. What's this? Beaten, kicked. Well, well. You found him. Scared, were you? The name was? Hey, photography's not allowed here! Bad photo. The mouth was open. No photography without permission! I won't publish these, just my paper. It'll be a good piece. - Don't you believe me? - Yes. I'll go at once. Of course they should have confiscated the film roll. But even a policeman is only a man. One had just had a son. The other came from the countryside. He still believed in humanity. Now the story gets even more absurd. He also found a car! Well, well... What do you know! Dammit. A nasty story. And all the better for that. That doubles my salary. Broken. Must be the flat hats' doing. Flat hats! That triples my salary. Taxi, taxi! I wore a new hat and coat for the first time that morning. Life was beaming at me. A man who thinks he's without worries. Just look at his face. Idiot! Fool! You may not know that I'm now chief of the first division - - and thus even Palmu's superior. Palmu himself encouraged me to become a judge, since... "Otherwise I might get even a bigger dunce for a superior." Learned men are needed everywhere nowadays. Men with organizational skills and wide perspectives. The individual has been replaced by a machinery, - - much more efficient than any one man could be. But... A nonconformist individual is always a cog in the wheel. Palmu always speaks of an "academic quarter" - - and he never even finished high school. - Morning! - Thank you. Put it there. I'll look at it later. Malkanen! I'm sorry. The report about the Observatory Hill case was on top. But it was a spring day and there were girls on the church steps. I wished I had binoculars, so that... I admit I was distracted. A policeman is only a man! One power's hidden in the heart of man... ...a power so great and... Good morning, choir boy. Good day. It's noon already! So time flies. I can hardly catch up with it. Modern times are so effective. One thing's good about them: they bring things close to us. - Not murders. - Maybe even them. There'll be a time when your effective machinery - - will take care of all the dirty work. The material will be on film, and the thinking - - will be done by one man sitting in a comfy chair. - Or lying on the couch. - That way, too. He'll have coffee, watch the film, read the report and think. But I probably won't live to see that day. I doubt it. And thank God for that! Though the Observatory Hill isn't that far away... - Do you have a report on it? - On what? Why, there it is. The boys were quick. Kokki, come here! And order some coffee. - Valkanen! - Yes? Any photos of the Observatory Hill case? - They should be ready soon. - Put the projector up. We'll look at them on the big screen, Palmu and myself. The coffee will be here soon, for three. This case is nice and messy. We haven't had one like this... It says the body belonged to a drunkard. A drunkard! Chief? The photos are ready to be watched. Good! We'll be right there. - He doesn't look like a drunkard. - That's because he isn't one. Lights! Give me the report. He's no drunkard, even if his clothes are... - Clothes! - Here they are. - Old but clean. - The socks are mended... So is the underwear. No drunkard, this. You shouldn't talk of one, then. Let's go on! Reason of death? The skull seems to have been fractured by a blow. The face shows signs of blows or kicks. Some ribs are broken and there are bruises all over. Everyone agrees that they are caused by kicks. - And not by car? - No, it would look different. Some fingerprints, blood and bubble gum were found in the car. The technical report isn't ready yet. - The flat hats, you think? - Perhaps. The car is stolen and investigated by group 3. Owner known. The car disappeared around 11pm. - The report will be here soon. - Very well! We'll keep in touch with group 3. Palmu will handle the case. I'll be in the chief's office. So will I. - The victim needs to be identified. - Might be difficult. - The fingerprints probably won't help. - They don't. Go see the pathologist. Reason and time of death. - I did order coffee for three... - Poor career choice. - And I didn't get any this morning. - You could go yourself. - Kokki will do it better. - Well, that's for sure. I'm telling you this so that the police won't seem suspicious. It was only 9:30am, and investigations were well on the way. Of course, Palmu is a hedonist. But he has his own methods. As he was thinking of the case, I could return to my favorite topic: the reorganization of the crime division. And I didn't want to meddle in the duties of my subordinates. But Kokki could have called and warned us! It would have given me a head start. With a margin of two hours. Between 11pm and 1am. Reason of death: fracture of the skull - - caused by a blow from a heavy soft object. - But only the autopsy... - Thank you, professor. Now you're going to make me a cup of coffee. Sure! I'll have the girl bring us some cake, and we'll sit and talk. What's this case all about? It's even in the Evening News. - What do you mean? - A reporter called us. He wanted to take photos. He had them from the scene of crime - - but said he couldn't publish them. Well, I said no. Nyet, as the Russians say. The Evening News... Is Eikka still working there? Sure, he's there putting one letter after another! It must be said in his honor that he didn't sit and wait. The events unrolled with a power that's hard to fight. The power of money. A sensation was in the works. Finnish Radio here. This is the daily broadcast. It's strange. The more I think of this case... - ...the drowsier you get. - Just gathering strength. This is going to be a dirty case. Just a feeling I've got. All hell's broken loose. That room's full of reporters. - I'll stall them with this button. - Kokki! Oh, shut up...sorry, chief. Just take a look at this. Here's one for you, too. BRUTAL MURDER ON OBSERVATORY HILL Have a look at the centerfold. They have no right to publish this! - They've taken that photo out. - This is a scandal. That's nothing, but this might be. "Numerous murders have been left unsolved by the police recently. Has the crime division been left behind? Are its methods and organization out of date? Is its crew intelligent enough - - or are they either too old or too inexperienced?" Boys, I think this concerns all of us. Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury. - This is the end. - No, this is just the beginning. There they are. No use delaying it. - Good day. - Good day. Please sit down. The chief's in a hurry, but he'll make a brief statement. Indeed, I am very busy. You are no doubt interested in the Observatory Hill case? Very well. The investigation is well on the way. The whole machinery is working. What do you want to know? Who is the victim? Well, at this point we can hardly... That's what I thought. How could the police know that? At this point. Mr. Nopsanen, let me point out - - that our methods are opposite to those of the yellow press. We reveal less than we know, you reveal more than you know. But since you insist, the victim is Fredrik Nordberg. A broker by profession. Lived in Helsinki all his life. - That's the way it is, boys. - What? What you write here makes co-operation difficult. - How did you get that? - By the long arm of the law. And now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen... Good day, commander. I know. I just spoke to the press. Yes... I know. Exactly. It's been taken care of. At full steam, of course. I'm sorry, I'm busy right now. Work is calling me. What did the commander say? To assign the whole division on this case. - Done. - Observatory Hill must be isolated. - Done. - Contact other police districts. - Done. - Keep an eye on flat hats. I ordered it. I asked them to report to the chief. One police is going to Nordberg's flat. - So will we. - The car is waiting. What would happen if I had to do everything myself? - Nothing good. - No indeed. A worker recognized the paper while it was still between rollers. - Rollers! - That's the way it's done. He recognized Nordberg. The editor in chief's orders - - were to stop the press and scrap the issue. Only I have it. - Attention, car 1. - Listening. We're approaching Seaman Street. They're emptying the victim's apartment. - What? Who? - The things are on the yard. We're on our way. Keep them there! Turn the siren on! Number 18. Drive there! The arrested people are upstairs. - Who do we have here? - Who do you think? - Thiefs and murderers. - Don't talk to the police that way. That's just the way this policeman has talked to me. - So what have you done? - Just been driving my truck. And I've paid every goddamn fine the cops have given me. And every goddamn cent of my taxes. You try being a goddamn entrepreneur... - There are ladies present! - ...with all the goddamn taxes! But I still haven't been called a thief and a murderer. Seems like an honest taxpayer to me. - So your services were requested? - They were, goddammit. And when I was carrying things downstairs, he comes up to me - - and asks why I'm carrying them. What else could I do, goddammit? - Is this the case? - Yes. - You know nothing of the case? - Not a thing, goddammit. You're free to go. You'll get the money later. - Sorry about the boys. - I would've shown this guy... Don't doubt that for a minute. My name is Inspector Palmu. And you are...? Saara Pohjanvuori. - And Fredrik Nordberg was... - My uncle, father's side. Nordberg, Pohjanvuori... I see. I came to help him move, and it was only here that I heard... I was wondering where he was, but we went ahead with the move. Well, the boys will carry them back inside. My consolations. Where was he going to move? - To a new flat in Southern Haaga. - Why? - I was also going to move there... - Did you live here? No, at home. But I got into a row with my dad. Who is the third cup for? It's...for my boyfriend, who was to come and help. But he didn't. Maybe he's at work. - No. - Why not, it's a working day? - He's unemployed. - Is he a student? - No. - What does he do, then? He has had a hard time. He grew up in children's homes. - But he's a good boy, even if... - ...he is a flat hat. No, a leatherjacket. You're not familiar with the names. - There's a difference? - A big one! - Was the row about him? - What if it was? Just asking... What is his name? - Ville Valkonen. - Age? - Seventeen. - Did he ever come here? - Oh yes, often. - Maybe he even had a key? - No, but I did. - Let me see his photo. Is this all about him? And I thought... - Handsome chap! - So what? - You can't change your appearance. - But you can gain a lot with it. What do you mean? He's not some casanova! He's a shy and honest boy, even if he is a leatherjacket. He needs to be part of something. - No one tells him where he should go... - There, there. My uncle finally understood. He wanted to help Ville - - and now he's dead... - We have a bad habit of questioning. Maybe we should make some coffee and have a little talk? You could tell us about your uncle. I'll go get some pastries! Now, make each cup with two spoons of coffee. Just what I was afraid of. You make good coffee. - Your uncle observed the stars? - And made horoscopes. Yes, it was a serious matter for him. Like everything else. - What else did he do? - He was a philatelist. - Some kind of a cultist? - A stamp collector! - His collection was very good. - But he couldn't make a living of it. - What was his profession? - He had a used book shop. But he closed it, because it didn't make any money. - Did he have any savings? - Some, I think... But he could get by on very little. He did tax returns and accounting. You left this place yesterday afternoon to go to work. Did your uncle say something of his plans for the evening? He said he'd go to Observatory Hill if the sky was clear. - For the last time, he added. - For the last time? What did he mean by that? That he couldn't make the trip from Haaga. The telescope was heavy - - and he had trouble with his heart. - Was it his own telescope? - Where is it now? - I don't know. - Hasn't it been found? - No. - Are you pregnant? - Yes. - Your boyfriend is the father? - Yes. That's why we were all going to move to the new flat... Now, now... - You know nothing of Ville? - No. And I'm worried! Why is the window nailed shut? I was standing there and started feeling ill. My uncle noticed it and got so mad he nailed the window shut. When was this? About a month ago, at the start of my pregnancy. Kokki! You'll stay here to do some work. You'll carry the things upstairs. The other boys will help you. She will tell you where everything should be. But don't strain yourself. We'll be back tonight. Put everything back the way it was. - Could I have the photo? - For sure. But not yet. I'll borrow it for a while. Calm down! I can't tell you anything. This evening at the soonest. You can take photos of the victim's flat! Reporters are like children or a pack of hounds. - Throw them a bone... - How about the public? Jackals feasting on a carcass. Sometimes I wish we lived in a dictatorship. A free press is one of the pillars of democracy. - Attention, car 1 speaking. - This is A. Get me information of all deliquancies of last night. Send them by radio and ask Malkanen to come there. Out. A cat won't catch a mouse by running all over the house. Not if the mouse has left his address. Here we are. Here's where it was found. The body was dragged to the bushes through here. The whole area has been combed and here's all we've found. All kinds of junk but nothing relevant to the case. Including these. - Left by the navy. - The city has a sanitary department! - But not lamps like these. - Are you looking for ants? - Please stop disturbing the police. - Don't push me! - Go look for some ants! - Please disperse. Did you read the Evening News? The police hasn't solved a murder - - in many years, and they won't! - But they'll find some ants. You won't find any flat hats there in the grass. This might be something. He was missing a wallet? - Where did you find it? - In the other bushes. - Attention, car 1 speaking. - This is A. Call 37477 and ask Miss Pohjanvuori - - what kind of a wallet did Nordberg have. - Right. Malkanen is here. - This is Malkanen. There are about 20 reports from last night. Well done! Now, take down this name and address. Valkonen, Ville, Elimäentie 14 A 63. Arrest him at once for interrogation. A young man of that name was arrested last night - - because of a disturbance in front of a café. - He was released at 11pm. - Well done! Now we'll find him. Send a report to all the cars: Increase searches among the flat hats. - The honor of the police is at stake. - I understand. Anything else? Report to me directly. Out. Now they'll see that the police is doing something. The boys found some fingerprints and a few drops of blood. We have the owner's fingerprints, so we can make comparisons. The car was started by old tricks. Probably some young boys. Clever enough to give false names at the hospital. Unless they just healed themselves. - What is that? - Who knows. A telescope! Even a blind hen sometimes finds a cock. You and your proverbs... - Helsinki is a beautiful city. - Chief, you're being called! But too much haste is ruining it, too. The wallet is black, worn out and old-fashioned. - It's folded three times... - It has some good fingerprints. We got a notice about a group of flat hats with a telescope. Arrest them all and bring the telescope to me. Out! Soon the cat will catch the mice! The cops! Stay where you are! He won't get far. Attention! - Who does this belong to? - The one that got away. - What's his name? - Ville. - Ville what? - Anyone know his surname? - I doubt that he has one. - We'll refresh his memory. - What were you watching? - Have a look for yourself. Their gym class just ended. Well, let's get into the car. What did we do? We weren't shooting at them. Brown leatherjacket, dark hair, no hat. Handsome. I'm listening. Saara, please forgive me. I'm really sorry. I don't understand... I really don't. I couldn't handle it when you told me about the baby. - Do you recognize this? - Of course. - Who does it belong to? - Me. You? Not to Nordberg? - No, he gave it to me. - When? - Yesterday. - At what time? At night. Well, he promised it earlier - - but asked me to get it at night. - From where? - From the Observatory Hill. - Why there? - He was looking at stars! - Why couldn't you pick it up at home? I don't know! Well, maybe so that he wouldn't have to carry it. - His heart is weak. Or was. - So you know he's dead. - I read it in the paper. - Well... - What time did he ask you to come? - At midnight. - Was he there that late? - Often. I was there with him. So what happened? At what time did you go there? A little past midnight. But he was no longer there. - Where was he? - At home. Or that's what I thought. - How did you get the telescope? - It was there. - Waiting for you? - In its usual place. - Wasn't that a bit strange? - Well, yeah. I thought he had left because I was late and he had heart trouble. - So you took it and went home? - It could've been stolen! And then you showed your pals girls taking a shower - - which was so interesting that you forgot to help your own girl move! How did you go to Observatory Hill? - Well, I... - I'll tell you! You took a car, which you had stolen earlier. Before that you caused a row in front of the café where your girl works. You broke a window and were arrested - - but released after interrogation. After that you drove the car into a tree. You didn't think that we took your fingerprints just for fun? Both of them belong to you. These were found in the car. - Who were your partners? - I won't snitch on my friends. Very well... - Your girl is pregnant. - What business is that to you? Nothing, but it's interesting from a human point of view. You might be interested to learn that she was very worried about you. - Why didn't you come? - None of your business! It's a strange thing to do! And typical of you last night. I'm very interested in what happened on Observatory Hill. - Who were you with? - If you think I killed Nordberg... I haven't said anything of the kind, but the thought isn't so far away - - unless you have something to add. It's up to you. Who were you with? You can help speed up things. We'll catch them anyway. Do they have a phone? I'll make you an offer. I'll turn my back while you dial. Ask them to come here and help you. Tell them they'd be caught anyway. The phone can't be tapped. Arska. It's Ville. I've been caught. In a jail. They're accusing me of murdering Nordberg. Listen... There's one thing you could do to help me. They suggested you come here and clear everything up. They'd let you off easier if you'd come here yourself. Oh, you won't come? Nice to know. Nice to know that, Arska. I won't snitch on you, don't worry! Malkanen, find out the number 701718 and send a police there! Bring Arska here, as well as his friends! Out. - How did you get the number? - Simply by listening. - He's a great detective. - Just go on with your nap. Strange that I always find myself drowsy this time of day. - Among others! - We'd need a pillow here. Take it up with the commander. Good day, Arska! And the Doll. - Howdy, inspector. - Goddamn stool pidgeon! Be quiet! He didn't tell us a thing. Sit down. Can I take off my coat? Can I have a smoke? Just as long as you tell us what happened last night. Have a look at these. Do they seem familiar? - What do you mean? - You think we bopped him off? - Or smashed the car. - This cop's a tough cookie. Your fingerprints on the photos, and the ones found in the car. Goddammit, what do you know! But I'm still underage. - 15, not 17. - Who's he, the janitor? No...not quite. Constable, send Arska to division 3. - He's well-known there. - But I didn't do it! At least I didn't drive. It was Ville... Don't howl, you fool! I knew Arska wasn't worth trusting but not like that! - Who drove the car? - Arska, of course. - Ville wouldn't hit a tree. - That guy's a worthless driver. Arska was the one who got the car. Ville only came with us 'cos we asked. - Or I asked... - Come on now! Ville... Well inspector, you gonna let me go home? Or are you gonna lock me up? I'm really 17. Knock it off, janitor. Your ship has sailed. Go home now! Comb your hair, wear a skirt - - and keep your bum off the table! - But I wanna be arrested! Go home, or I'll give you a spanking! Well, Ville. So many girls that you have to shove them away. - That's just a trophy. - Tell me... Did you and Nordberg get into a row about Saara? - No. Why? - Why didn't you help them? Why do you have his telescope? Why was he found murdered in the very spot where you got it? Why was he murdered just then? You don't answer, because you can't. The answer is that you murdered him last night. Not true, goddammit! You're under arrest as a murder suspect. - What now? - Arska has been arrested. Well done. And we'll take care of this one. Let me take him. We'll sort this thing out... Hello! No, I can't give a statement as yet. But you could say we're on the right track. Thank you and goodbye! Hello, chief of 1st division speaking. Good day, Mr. Government Adviser I see... Is that the case? Sad to hear that. Of course, in that case... You can't expect us to ask the arrested whose sons they are! - Can't you keep them quiet? - They won't do as I say. Open the door! Get out of there! Be quiet! You're all free to go home. Which one of you is the Government Adviser's son? Tell your father that I didn't let you go because of his call - - but for other reasons. Go now, and watch your manners! - What manners? - Bad manners! - Palmu! You didn't...? - He's just sleeping. Maybe I should get him a blanket, or some food when he wakes up? - Keep the door closed! - Where would he go from there? "Maybe I should get a blanket..." That reminds me of another watchman. Kokki must be bored by now. Or choked on a bun. Thank you! Should I make some more for you, too? Thank you, I think I've had enough. - Should I pat your back? - I wouldn't dare. Might come up. - Maybe it was an oink and not a burb? - Could be. I heard about a man who grew donkey's ears. And one developed a cloven hoof. So if you eat a lot of pork... - Any news about Ville? - Yes. He's under arrest. This food is delicious. You will make a good housewife. He's fast asleep now and dreaming of you. Don't be worried. I promise he'll soon be in your arms. - But... - First we have to solve the murder. If you have some time, I'd have something to tell you. How clean it is in here! Everything is in order. I suppose your uncle was a pedantic man? Extremely so. Nothing was allowed to interfere with the order. - What I meant was... - So this is his handwriting. - Very interesting! - If you're interested... Thank you, dear girl! The universe is beautiful. - What? - My uncle loved the stars. He often said that stars have a lot to tell us, if we only listen. Palmu, time is wasting. If you're done, I'd like to tell you that this drawer has been broken into. - Who did it? - Who knows, but I noticed it. I took the fingerprints and did all I should, plus a bit of my own. In brief: two bankbooks, receipts and a torn envelope. - But a lot of money is missing. - Uncle... Uncle won the lottery jackpot in March, as Saara told me. 7 million marks, minus taxes, leaving 4,9 million. The state is ruthless. Anyway, Saara's share: 0,5 million. The uncle's share: 1 million. A receipt for a new share: 2 million. That makes 3,5 million. Where's the missing 1,4 million? - And the price of the share... - 2,7 million marks. 700,000 to be paid on Monday, so I figured something's missing. Something else is missing, too. The tax receipt. - Had it on the tip of my tongue. - Maybe the thief took it? - Why would he do that? - For tax return, don't you see? The will shows that everything goes to you. - Did you know of this? - Yes, my uncle told me. - He and Ville had a row, right? - Yes. So what? Uncle said Ville couldn't handle money but where would he have learned it? - In his age... - In his age boys are hot-tempered. I think we have the key to the case right here. - Were his keys found here? - No. Nor in his pockets nor at the scene of crime... - Did you discuss abortion? - Palmu! No, and we won't. I'll support my child, and Ville too. Don't attack Ville. He's a better boy than many boys from good homes. - He doesn't even have a home... - Well, it's high time he got one. Now, now... Blow your nose and wipe your pretty little eyes. The chief will help you put on your coat. The lottery jackpot in March went to Rovaniemi. - Are you sure? - I have a friend... I thought so. The uncle was lying. - Or the girl. - Not that girl. - Howdy, inspector. - How did... Those detectives let me come wait in here. - I lied to you. - What about? When I said I had no idea what Ville was doing meanwhile. - I did know. - Well, tell me! You see, I'm mad about Ville. I left Arska to take care of the car and ran after Ville. But he was only searching for his uncle or whatever - - and wondering why the telescope was standing there alone. I admit I was hanging on to him but he kept pushing me away. But I thought I'd get him anyway. I was wild! Just when I was about to get a kiss he pushed me away, and... It was Arska, who had driven the car to a tree. And he nearly went to pieces himself! I'd swear this with my two fingers wherever you want. I believe you. And now my theory is in pieces too. Push the red button and I'll console you a bit... Not now... Inspector... Well, if you insist, inspector! I felt that I wasn't good for anything and - - I also felt that... - Of course you're good! Just let us know if you need anything. - Modern girls are so energetic. - Won't you lock the door? No, because Ville can't sleep with the door shut. Release Ville. He's innocent. - No, you can't do this to Alpio! - What? Besides, the murderer will calm down if the press... I hope he doesn't see the girl. She's forbidden to be here. Forbidden love is the sweetest kind. No, I have nothing else to tell the press. I'm sorry! - It's not even that cold. - Or windy. - But then spring is in the air. - Yes, yes... - The chief! At this hour! - And just gazing at the stars! You should know that the sky is cloudy. - What do you see? - Take a guess! A ship from Brazil. Try to guess now! The Uspensky Cathedral. The Russian church. Try to guess now. The Presidential Palace! Try to guess now. The Swedish Embassy. The police station. - I'm ashamed. - Just bad luck. What is this... A girl in a nightie! - Well, it's over now. - Palmu tripped me over! Not fair! Come, boys. We have work to do. Hey Palmu, wake up! The coffee's ready. - I wasn't sleeping. - Just thinking. Thinking out loud. That was his mistake. - It's cosy in here. - Not too clean. And it's night. Night is always a nice time. With people asleep, there's no hustle and bustle. You see things clearer at night. How I remember the old days... I know. There was only a handful of you, all eager. Now there's only the machinery. See what you did. You spilled milk on his table. Come in! I have every case from somewhere near that area. We won't get the rest until the morning. - Murder is the only reason... - You can go sleep now. Man is no machine, you see. If he blackmailed with something he saw, it had to be murder. No one would pay 5 million for a petty crime. But what proof do we have that he blackmailed? Such a nice man. Then why did he lie about the jackpot? There are brutal killers who wouldn't harm a fly. - Too much niceness can be bad. - Very well. If he saw a murder with his telescope, why focus on Observatory Hill? Why not study all crimes in Helsinki? Too much work, and very unlikely. Why was he murdered? Because he kept on blackmailing. First he got 3,5 million. Then he asked for 1,5 million, adding up to 5 million. The jackpot minus taxes. He wouldn't have lost the receipt. Then the murderer took his keys and looked for something in the flat. - Without result. - For what? His own name, for example. Of course. How could I not see it before? Palmu, I subscribe to your theory. Let's set the wheels rolling. All we need is the murderer. Ah, it's night. Where is everybody? Start with us. What did you discover? The telescope! He loved the stars. This was the symbol of that love. Blackmailing tarnished it. That's why he wanted to give it to Ville. Ille faciet - he was to do it. A new generation! Ville, the only begetter of his beloved Saara! Surely you realize what this is? Well? It's clear as day. A phallic symbol! Major Vadenblick. Carl Gustaf Vadenblick. What do we know of him? What would we poor know of the rich? Only hearsay. And examination records. Where do you see a murder in this? I don't know yet. I get paid for trying to find out. The little I do get. Vadenblick's apartment can be seen by the telescope. The distance... Could the murder be noticed across the cove? - Did his wife fall out of this window? - We'll find out. Let's look through the telescope and visit the apartment. We'll say, "Excuse us, Major, just measuring a bit." Only the maid is in. My friend is a janitor there. - He also told me that... - He'll tell me as well. Let's go! Let's take the bull by the horns. Or the ox! She fell from up there, the 6th floor, and died immediately. She drank heavily for many years. They had the money for it. We expected something like this. She was in hospitals and sanitariums. They tried to make her stop, but she was used to getting it all. Yes, we know. How about the Major? He buried her, took the money and married the sister. The younger sister who doesn't drink. The Major doesn't drink either. He's a tough and brutal man. Well, he's a soldier. - Though officers also hit the bottle. - And now only the maid is there? A quiet one that the Major hired after his wife's death. The former used to drink together with the wife. They send her off to South America after there were rumors. It's nice to work there, though... Thank you! You just need to wipe the dust. The criminal police. We'd like to have a look inside. Is the Major at the countryside? Don't be afraid. We won't do anything or take anything. We'll soon be out of here. Excuse me. We'll need a little light. Is this where she fell down? Do you know? - It'd be an easy fall! - Listen, Palmu... That's horseplay. The Gutzeit building. Old Helsinki is going away. Soon I'll be gone as well. Anyway... This should be enough. A stallion of a man! It almost seems as if no one was living here. Does the Major live in his mansion? - That's must be the dead wife. - One of Helsinki's most eligible women. She succumbed to alcohol, like so many others. It was suicide...or perhaps not. Who is she? Maire's daughter from her previous marriage. She was killed in a yacht accident. The Major survived. There were rumors that it wasn't an accident - - and that he had seduced the girl. Soon afterwards he married Maire. There were no children, fortunately. Then Maire died, and now a third woman of the same family is warming his bed. The Major has also increased his shares in the company. There was nothing about this in the case records. I have friends in the market, though it's hard to believe. Death seems to follow the Major, for whatever reason. Thank you! You can't fault his taste in liquor. - Three stars. - Above stars. V.S.O.P. We should go now. Let's go. There's nothing but relics here. Thank you very much, and sorry for the trouble! Hey, your hat! She wasn't mute after all! I admit I'm a bit uncomfortable with that question. But I'll give a straight answer to a straight question. I have no problem with continuing investigations of my sister's death. I don't think it has been properly cleared up. My sister was ill, as you know. But I don't think she would have committed suicide. That's my opinion. As his brother and head of the family I wish truth would come out. It's not just about me, but also the company I head. The world is ruthless and takes advantage if such a thing - - isn't dealt with properly. We've had enough trouble with the press. I understand. The press can be ruthless. To start with, you can help us proceed in a delicate way. We're interested in Vadenblick's finances. What can I do? Give us the information about his holdings and his position. Including the shares of his second wife. Very well. I'll give them to you. I admit that I disapproved of both marriages. I wouldn't describe my relations with Vadenblick as warm. We're also interested in his bank affairs after your sister's death. - I'll call the bank director. - Thank you. If I could ask for something... Our choir is going to Copenhagen and we're collecting money. Even small sums are appreciated. There you go. Take it to the cashier. Thank you very much! - What an embarrassment! - I wouldn't say that. - This isn't funny. - Good man. Didn't want to bribe. Let's do some arithmetics, children! On the left you have Vadenblick's and his wife's withdrawals - - from 11 to 13 March. The Major also sold 850,000 worth of shares. Total: 3,550,000. On the right you have Nordberg's and Saara's deposits. The dates are nearly the same and they add up to 3,500,000. Lights! - You always had a head for figures. - But not for languages, like you. Well boys, alea iacta est. We'll take the stallion by the horns. We'll go see Major Vadenblick. But before that... Vadenblick? Know him. I was with him in the war. Tough character. Killed his own men. Let's sit down. - What about him? - We have your story about the case. The death was declared a suicide. It was yours? I also wrote one with more doubts, but then stopped. Life's too dear. Say what you will, it wasn't suicide. This hangover makes my mouth dry. One plus one is two, two plus two is five. Nordberg knew it was murder, so he blackmailed. He wanted more and was murdered. Amen! Can I come with you? I'll print good things about you. - No. - I'll let you go to parliament. If we see you, we'll shoot. Please don't. I'd rather go underground. - No siren! - All Southern Finland will hear us. - Just accompanying. - Let's take it from the top. Who's one struck down by our mighty club - - will stay that way... - Something a bit more lyrical. Once on a summer night I ventured... And my heart was searching - - for a place of peace and quiet. Finland is so beautiful. What are you doing here? Get the hell out! - I'm shooting crows. There's one! - Goddamn you, kid! - Must be one of the Vadenblicks. - If that's the son... ...what's the father like? At least he has a nice house. That must be him. - Goddammit, you got here quick! - As quick as we could. - Welcome! - Dad! Dad, that man took my rifle. Kill him. - He shot through the window! - They were trespassing. - I was shooting crows. - And you let them take your weapon? - For shame! Go to your room! - Yes, dad. I trust you have the handcuffs? The man keeps driving through my land... - Aren't you the new rural police? - No, just an old officer. Judge Virta, head of the murder squad. We are moving our papers to the archives... Just a formality. Some facts about your wife's death... - If you don't mind. - I see. Come in, gentlemen. Annika! Annika! Come on down. My wife. Policemen from Helsinki. Would you serve us some tea? In the English style. If you please, gentlemen... Thank you. Thank you, but I don't drink tea. Excuse me. Since I come from the country, I'm interested in the surroundings. - Could I have a look around? - Of course! It's worth a look, now that I've fixed up the place. When I got this after the war, the whole place was in shambles! I took debt and bought machines. Mortgaged the whole place. The country was cut to pieces, but I just kept on expanding. The land can't be left to slackers. And I won! Just need to get rid of a few bums I have for neighbors. - Go have a look! - Thank you. Thank you. Excuse me. The press insinuated that your wife's death was suspicious. - I'm sorry, Miss Melkonen... - Mrs Vadenblick. Excuse me. I'm such an old fool that I get things mixed up. The deceased was your sister... Why are you shaking? If you're sick, go upstairs! Maire was her sister. You know she was an alcoholic? But you don't know what I had to go through with. I can't stand neglicence and idleness. The whole world is going to hell! Everything is turning rotten. A big bomb will have to take care of it all. We need discipline! The war was a good thing. It kept the nation tight in its fist. Of course the press insinuated. Everyone knew she drank. Jackals always feast on a carcass. That night we had a party with some guests. Maire and I had a row. She said she'd kill herself. Everyone heard it. I heard her scream and rushed to the living room. I saw her fall. She screamed and fell... Excuse me. I'm not feeling well. I'll go upstairs. That's what the whole family's like. Nerves! The women are hysterical, the men democrats. Democracy is cowardice, fear of responsibility. Her brother is also a democrat. You attended a board meeting with your wife the other night. So he told you? Very well... We did have a row. They tried to pressure us. Even Annika is in her brother's leash. And I thought the countryside would improve her nerves... - Whose? - Annika's. Hey, come here! Come here and have a look! Now that's something. That's what I call strength. What is it? Why did you scream? Do you hear me? Where did this come from? This photo of a drunkard's body was too much for you? - I knew him. - You did? How? - I visited him. - On Seaman's Street? We're investigating his murder. Why did you visit him? He did horoscopes. He did one for me. What the hell have you got yourself mixed up in? - Did you meet him often? - A few times. - He said our fate is in the stars... - Did you believe him? He forecast some things that came true. - And then... - Calm down. He told you something you didn't like. He said that according to the stars I shouldn't... ...I shouldn't get married. The stars are against it. - Rubbish! - And now you feel that... I'm somehow responsible for his death. You should get some rest. Should I close the window? She's ill. It's those nerves! Doctors said she should rest, but even rest here isn't enough. That's why I'm building her an eagle's nest. I can show it to you. It's nearby. Here's where I'll build the eagle's nest. Clean living! No goddamn nerve diseases. Follow me, gentlemen. You just go round there. Here my forefathers guarded the land centuries ago. They were bandits, to tell you the truth! Those were the days when men were men. Now all we have is ninnies and sissies. This is Annika's favorite spot. I'll have a railing here. Dammit, I slipped! I can see well with these... That yacht had better watch out in this wind. Someone might get hurt! Is that the window of your wife's room? - Yes. - That's what I thought. - Will the nest be made of wood? - No, rock and granite. It'll be built for centuries, not just today. The foundation was laid yesterday. The history of my family is here, starting with the bandits. Future generations will read of their exploits. They'll see that there were men even in an age of cowards! Heil Hitler! If there were more like him, I'd vote for communists. - Let's go back and arrest the Major. - No. - Let's arrest his wife, then. - No. - Her life is in danger! - No it isn't, believe me. Well, I don't. You always arrest innocent people. I'm good at scenting the guilty ones. I can't arrest him without evidence, just by scent. - This is still a free country. - Hey, boys... Let's get some coffee. They only had that English-style tea. To think I promoted you as chief... Excuse me... ...that I shouldn't marry. The stars are against it! - It's clear! - What? Annika isn't nerveshot, but afraid for her life. She knows all. Seeing Nordberg's face was a shock that made her realize many things. She's now in mortal danger. The Major is a wild stallion that'll stampede any obstacles. Let's go! I still don't understand how the paper got into the room. You tell him. I don't care to. Our farmer boy here came up with that idea. What I wouldn't give for a summer cottage, boys. He's running to warn his father! Dad! Dad! Why is there no response? Do you think... They must be at the eagle's nest. We're in a hurry. - You go by the beach, we by the hill. - I'll go across the yard. Go ahead! Kokki! - Are you hurt? - Yes, in the side Let's have a look. - No blood. - Of course not. I just slipped. But someone fired a gun. - Were you shooting here? - No. We were being shot at. - Why are you here? It's strange. - Lot of strange things here. We also have some questions to ask. - Not very tactical. - We've gone past that phase. - Where's your wife? - My wife? - Thank God. - She was shocked by your visit. I showed her the nest. She's back to normal. But I don't want her to see you again. Come! Who fired a gun? It saved her life. One more second, and she would lie crushed down there. Listen... You have a hole there! That was close! Kokki, we haven't finished yet. Still waiting for the questions. I won't ask you how a certain soldier was killed in 1944. Or what happened in your yacht accident in 1947 - - when a young woman was drowned. But what did Fredrik Nordberg see with his telescope on October 5? - How should I know? - Perhaps your late wife's fall? After you had pushed her! You are making things up like some broad. How do you explain the sums and times here? You fools! Just a coincidence. I accuse you of the murders of your wife and Fredrik Nordberg. Fools! You can't prove it. I can prove that you were about to push your wife down. You swine! You make things up. - Proof? - We will blow them out. From the foundation hiding your family's misdeeds. Murderer! You killed Sinikka, Maire and Nordberg. Now you've killed your son. Halonen, get off the line of fire! Goddammit! - Well, Vadenblick! - Kill me right here! - Who fired? You? - No. - Who the devil was it? - This devil. You never know which branch the devil is sitting on. Enough of this bloodshed. I'm a humanist. I could've killed him, even wanted to. Remember shooting that soldier? That's that. This last act was a good one. A Swedish mansion, a crazy Nazi and Finnish policemen. All we need is Ivan the Terrible and the Fenno-Baltic question. What did you talk inside? The window was closed. I have everything else. Don't be afraid, child. It'll get better. - Just a fleshwound. - Thank God for that. - We'll take him to town by car. - Thank you. - Will you come with us, mother? - Of course. - A full confession. - And Nordberg's keys. The saddest story I have ever heard. Well, boys. Spring is here! That's about it. Why wade through garbarge? Saara and Ville were married. Alpio was the bestman. We got Ville a place in school and will continue to help him. All riddles have been solved. Except one. Who was the lady who found the body? The boys forgot to ask... Alli Pelkonen. That's me! - Where are you going? - To Europe. The counsellor paid for our trip. Palmu is our mascot, he doesn't sing. Usually not, but on special occasions... But that's a different story altogether! Subtitles by Veikko
