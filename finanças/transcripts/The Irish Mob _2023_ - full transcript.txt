[dramatic music] - [Val] My name is Valentino Fagan. But friends and family call me Val. I got the name Valentino 'cause my ma loved the voice of Francesco Valentino, the opera singer. I run Dublin city. I decide what happens. [door banging] - [gangster] Hey, where are you going, hey? Where the fuck are you going? Where the fuck are you going? - Val, man, please, I haven't said anything. I promise, I won't say any, fuck, please! - [ganster] Get down! - [Val] 'Cause this is my city and no one is gonna take it from me. [ax thudding] [steady rock music] ♪ There's chaos in the streets ♪ ♪ There's blood on their hands ♪ ♪ I feel a tide is coming ♪ ♪ And no one understands ♪ ♪ It's my city ♪ ♪ No one's gonna take it from me ♪ ♪ My city ♪ ♪ And no one's gonna take it ♪ ♪ From me ♪ ♪ Chaos in the streets ♪ ♪ Blood on their hands ♪ ♪ I feel a storm is coming ♪ ♪ And no one understands ♪ ♪ It's my city ♪ ♪ No one's gonna take it from me ♪ ♪ It's my city ♪ ♪ And no one's gonna take it ♪ ♪ From me ♪ [gloomy tense music] - [Val] This shower are the bane of my life. The inevitable thorn in my side, the Garda. For years, these scumbags have been chasing me and the boys, trying to get us locked up. They harass us at every turn. Searching us, searching our gaffs, searching our cars, and especially dicks like this fella, Hogan, and his partner, O'Neill. But the worse of them all, Detective Inspector Liz Delahunt. - This operation has been set up to target this man, Val Fagan. He is the biggest importer and distributor of drugs in the country. Now, Fagan operates the Irish end of a drugs distribution network for these two, the Corrigan brothers, operating out of Amsterdam. Things have escalated with the murder of John Kilroy last night. Now, Kilroy was a money man in a money laundering racket through a dodgy casino. Unfortunately, Fagan got to him first. As for his gang, Fagan's right-hand man is Alan Reynolds. Ex-army ranger, he's cautious, highly intelligent, and extremely loyal. Dennis Keogh, aka Carrot. Loudmouth scrote. Greg Cushion, aka Cushty. And then, we come to Mark Wells. He Fagan's main triggerman. So we are gonna start at the bottom of the pile with known street-level dealers like this fella, Bazza Hogg, and we are gonna work our way up. Because the goal here is to get a charge on Fagan for directing an organized crime group, okay? - [Val] This tramp first caught me in a stolen jammer when I was 15. Me and the boys have been trying to outrun her and her band of merry men ever since. They hate us and we hate them. - He in back there? - In the office with the lads. - It's going to be traveling down from the north tomorrow, and it's full to the fucking roof with all these ultra smart HD TVs. Now, I'm being told these go for anywhere up to a grand each and there's gotta be nearly 200 of them already. - That's last week's takes for Bazza, yeah? - Right. Now, with these TVs, I make that up to 200 grand's worth. That's a nice earning for all of us. - When did you say it was heading down? - Leaves Belfast in the morning. It's all there? - It's a little bit light. Wanted to restock them for this week and he said he'll make up the difference next week. - What's his excuse? - Blaming Ringo for poaching his customers or whatever. Apparently there's a bit of grief between the two of them. - I heard Ringo's sister gave Baz's bird a few slaps. - Women. Why am I not surprised? - Right. There's that job for you's in the morning. Get geared up. Cushty and Wellsy will fill you in. When the job's done, I want you to sort out and start shifting the gear, yeah? - Yeah. - Right. Right. Dessie Corrigan was on the blower to me this morning. He want's to go off to Amsterdam tomorrow. - About the shipment next week? - I don't know. But I need you to book his flights. - Yeah. No bother. - Any word from your pal in the Old Bill? - Yeah, the cops are upping their game on you. Liz Delahunt is leading the charge. - [Val] Renno's ability to gain information is unbelievable. He has his ear to the ground for everything. Whether it be from a handle in the cops or listening to talkers on the street. It's a valuable asset to have that he can get a head's up and keep the wolves away from my door. And that for me is good for business. [tense music] But some things aren't good for business. Like this scumbag. Decco Cunningham. Probably the most vile psychopath known. He got his fucked-up head after a prisoner jumped him with a machete a week after Decco raped him. And although Decco lost an eye and was left with a face like a well chewed toffo, Decco left him in a coma with a fractured skull. - [speaks in Gaelic] Decco pal, you alright? - Got any nose? Any sniff? - You think I'd fucking let you down, do you? Good stuff that, as well. What's the plan for later? - Round up the troops. I have a bit of work for us in a few hours. - [Val Voiceover] He's out now after serving eight years for manslaughter. And little do I know the problems this man will cause me. [gloomy tense music] - Wellsy, go ahead with Dessie in the morning, yeah? - [Mark] Yeah, no bother, pal. - Myself and Renno have to go to Amsterdam so you, Carrot, and Cushty get yourselves sorted. Don't stay at home tonight. - No problem here. Me and Carrot are sorting the gear, yeah? - Yeah, he'll sort that. - No problem, come out, I'll give you a shout when the job's done, yeah? - Yeah, well listen, just tell him I'm dying for a piss. - No problem, man. - Yeah, I'll let you go. Where's Luca? - He's in his room. - Jesus Christ, Tanya? - [Tanya] What? - The hum in there. That's disgusting. - It was that Indian I had last night, didn't agree with me. - Oh, you didn't even flush it! - Al-fucking-right. I'll flush it now, so. - Well, I tell you, the next time the pipes get blocked, I'll unclog it with your fucking head! - Yeah, yeah. - [Val Voiceover] Despite all I am and what I do. - Alright, champ? - Hi, Dad. - [Val Voiceover] The one thing that tops everything in my life is my son, Luca. - What are you playing? - [Val Voiceover] My greatest honor is being his da. And for everything I ever held in my arms, the best by far is him. Nothing or no one can ever change that. And the same goes for Renno. You might think me and him are the closest of mates and I suppose we are. But there's one person in his life he puts ahead of everything else. His wife Esther. - Hey. - Hey. - Cuba? - Mm. - Jeez, do you remember the last time we were there? Put some greasy fucker in his hole. Dislocated his shoulder and broke his teeth. - Yeah, well, he was trying to steal my handbag, wasn't he? - Yeah, well he was a big fucker, though. You know, I don't think you're afraid of anything, are you? By the way, I have to go to Amsterdam tomorrow. - Will you be gone long? - Depends on Val. [tender orchestral music] [tense dramatic music] [brakes screeching] - Oh, fuck's sake, I didn't do it! - Oh yeah? What's this then? - I dunno, it's not mine. - My bollocks they're not yours. - I swear to God! [yelps] Bit tight, innit? - Bazza, you're under arrest for an offense under Section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. You're not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so but anything you do say will be taken down in writing and may be used as evidence. - Oh, I already have a suspended sentence, I can't get locked up for this one. - Well that's your problem. - For fuck's sake! - Unless you wanna come clean with where you got it. - You're gonna be charged for this. And we'd be lucky to keep you in custody. - But if you wanna get something off your chest, we might be able to sort station bail for you. - Fucking TVs, yeah? - What? - Carrot is supposed to be getting his hands on a load of these high-end smart TVs. Dunno what the story is on them, but he asked me to shift a load for him. That's all I know, yeah? [tense music] - Alright, buddy? [laughs] Pop over here. - Get in, you fucking prick! - Get the fuck off me, you fairy. Sit there now, come on, hands out. Come on, come on, come on, hands out, there we go. Now, keep your mouth shut, alright? Or we'll have to fucking tape that up as well, yeah? Good man, you're doing great, buddy. - Where's your fucking license? - It's up in the windscreen visor. - We know who you fucking are, yeah? Now we know where you fucking live too. - You go to the fucking Guards, we're gonna come to your house and ride your wife, alright? - My wife passed away about a year ago. - Aw, boo fucking hoo! - Then we'll dig her up, so. - And then we'll fucking ride her! [laughs] Let's get this fucking car on the road, huh? - Oh! Jesus! [alarm beeping] Won't go into fucking gear, man. - There's nothing wrong with it, it's your fucking head won't go into gear! - [sighs] Are you for fucking real? - If you wanna drive, then fucking drive. - Just shut up and fucking drive the thing, will you? Yeah? What's the story? - All good, yeah? - All good here. - Yeah, just bring him down the back roads and dump him out somewhere, yeah? - [Carrot] Alright, good man, see you up there. [tense music] [jet engines roaring] - So, do you rent this place out or what? - I own it. - Do you? - Yeah. - So, security's good, you know? - Yeah, the top floor is private. Hi, Gitzer. - Hi, Val. - I see the lads are here already. - Yeah. They're over there. - You wait here with Gitzer, yeah? - No worries. Gitzer, good to see you again. How's things holding up on your end? - Up and down, Renno. - Yeah? - Fucking Moroccan cunts are giving grief. Dessie and Noel are up the walls about it 'cause they're in bed with the Russians. - Oh, and what's the story there? - The story is, the Russians are shipping Moroccan product onto the continent through Eastern Europe and Dessie and Noel are not one bit happy about it. - Hm. Yeah, I can only imagine. - [Val] It was seized? - Yep. The DEA in the States were keeping tabs on it when it left Bolivia. They hit it as soon as it was in international waters. - How much? - 20 tons of it. - Jesus Christ, 20 tons of coke? - [Noel] Yep. - So where does that leave us? - Not good. That consignment was meant to supply most of Europe. You were meant to be getting some for this week. - Yeah, that's right. - Thing is, Val, we need everyone to pull together on this. We need to get back onto the South Americans to get a new and bigger consignment. To make up for the shortfall. But we need to get the funds together. - How much are you's talking? - Look, everyone has to chip in. Now, I know this is asking a lot but we need you to come up with seven figures. - A million quid? - Val. I know it's a lot of money. But do whatever you can to get it. - Look at it this way, Val, we know you're doing a good job back home and you're running a tight ship and everything is in order, and we admire that. But you pull through on this with us and it won't be forgotten. However, Val, and you can take this whatever way you want, you don't do this for us, then we find someone else that will. You get what we're saying here? - When do you need this money by? - [Noel] Within the next month. - Fuck it, yeah. I'll see what I can do. - Fair play to you, Val. I know you won't let us down. - [Dessie] You're a good team player, Val. We appreciate this. - Liz? [door knocking] I was just talking to Kevin Hogan. He told me he gave Bazza Hogg station bail on that drug capture. - Yes, that's right. - Well, why? He's known for sale and supply. - Because I advised him to. - We're tasked with getting people like Hogg off the streets and I think Kevin Hogan should've- - Whatever Kevin Hogan does or doesn't do is none of your concern, Seamus. Is there something else? - Yeah. The Super dropped this in to me earlier. - Fuck's sake! - No, no, no. - You're cutting our budget?! - My hands are tied. - Well un-fucking-tie them! - I have the Chief breathing down my neck on this. There's nothing I can do. - The Chief is lining up his own promotion and meanwhile Val Fagan is allowed to wander around doing whatever he bloody well likes. - I don't know what to tell you, Liz. [tense music] - [Val Voiceover] And now, like myself, the cops are hit with their own financial burdens. And by the time Renno and me land back into Dublin, I feel the pressure of the Corrigans' task. But Renno gives me a glimmer of hope. - So the place is like fucking Fort Knox. - Every stronghold has its weak points, Val. - And you think this can be done? - I wouldn't have mentioned it if I didn't think we can pull it off. - Tell me what you're thinking. - Right, at least seven men. Means you'll have to roll your sleeves up and get your hands dirty on this one, yeah? - Right. - We need a mix of tools and at least two automatic yokes. - It's gonna be some job to source that kind of firepower without the Old Bill getting a sniff of it. - Yeah, I was thinking that. Still have a couple of contacts in the RA. They'll probably look for a small cut after the job is done. - Yeah. - Yeah? - Set up a meeting, see what they have to say about it. - No bother. Right, quick piss then a couple of pints, yeah? - Renno. - Yeah? - Thanks. You're a good mate. Everything you do for me, I appreciate it. - Don't mention it, pal. [tense music] - [Val] As for Decco Cunningham, you might recall a bit of work he had lined up for him and his goons. - Oi! [all clamoring] - Don't move! - You hear me? - You're coming with us. - Keep your hands down. Right, you're coming with me, come here. - Get 'em up. - Come here! Don't resist me, do you hear me? - [Val] A tiger kidnapping. When he was locked up, Decco got a whisper of a soft touch for a stroke. Northern Cross Dog Track. And the only way to the dog track's safe was through the manager. - And this is your wife, Marie. We've been watching you for quite a while now. Guess what I'm gonna do with your bitch wife? I'm gonna take her head off. And just to show you we mean business. - No, no! - No! - No! - [Val] Decco knows the safe is on a time lock so he separates and holds them 'til next morning. - We're gonna take her with us now, yeah? - [Val] He then gives the manager instructions. - Take this phone. - [Val] Tells him if he wants to see his wife again, he'll do exactly as he says. - [Decco] Say goodbye to your wife the last time. - [Val] As for the box? So the neighbors don't see the wife being taken away. - [Decco] Hurry the fuck up. Get every single bit of that money in that safe. - [Manager] I am, I'm getting it all now. - [Decco] Shut the fuck up! - [Val] And this fella's shitting himself and just wants to see his wife again so he does exactly as he's told. - I have it all. - [Decco] Go out the side door to the car park and put the bag in the boot, close the boot, and walk away. Don't look at the driver or you'll be sent pieces of your wife in the post. Now, fuck off! - Oi, oi! My wife, Marie! [gloomy music] - [Val] Once Decco has the money they dump the wife out in the middle of nowhere. Decco put the fear of God into that couple. And he and his crew just made over 100k for a night's work. [tense dramatic music] - Armed Gardai! Get on the ground, get on the fucking- - Alright, yeah! - Get on the ground! Face down on the ground. Stay down. - I'm fucking doing it. - Yeah, alright. - Fuck's sake, I'm hardly going anywhere. - Shut up! - Wankers. - We all good? So. How are things with you? Well, it's like this, Dennis, you have just been caught in possession of over 100,000 euros' worth of stolen televisions. We also know that you have been skimming off the top of Val's drug payments and then blaming the street dealers for coming up short. [window knocking] - Cigire, a call just came through. A tiger kidnapping. The manager of the Northern Cross Greyhound Stadium. - Well, it couldn't have been Fagan, he's only back from Amsterdam, and we've Carrot here. - But who's out there dealing with it now? - Local DDU and Scenes of Crime. - Okay, well keep me posted on any further updates, please, Aisling. Kevin, a word. If we get Carrot talking, he is to deal with you personally and no one else, okay? Let's keep our cards close to our chests on this one. Strictly on a need to know basis and right now, only you and I need to know. - Yeah, of course, Cigire. - Okay, good man. [gloomy music] - [Val Voiceover] Despite me not knowing about Carrot's fuck up with the TVs, I'm more concerned about how Renno got on in his meeting with his IRA contacts. - How did it go? - Yeah, it's looking good. Had to run a bloody army council, but, shouldn't be a problem. - Good stuff. Put the wheels in motion for it now, yeah? The best thing you can do, Renno, is go to ground. Go off-radar altogether until you think it's time to move on this. And the less people that know about it the better, as well. - No problem. Fair bit of planning involved but I'll let you know when it's ready, yeah? - Alright. Do what you have to do. - [Val Voiceover] Things seem to be back on track. Then Carrot hits me with his story about the TVs. - What are you in a panic for? - It's the lock-up, man. Think it got raided, TVs are gone. - You better be fucking joking me, Carrot. - I swear to God, Val. If I hadn't have done a bleeding walkabout myself, I would've been bang to rights. - Tell me exactly what happened. - I was doing what you asked, I was going to get rid of them. But then I fucking decked the cops scoping the place out in one of them unmarked Mariah vans. - [Val] How did you know they were the cops? - Because I fucking spotted Hogan. He was fucking red-hot, he was. - They see you? - No. - Are you sure? - 100%, man. - [Val] Who else knew about the lockup? - Nobody. - Who knew about the TVs? - I organized Bazza Hogg to ship a few of them for us. - Bazza Hogg? - [Carrot] Yeah, who else, man? - [Val Voiceover] I think it's time for me to do my own bit of investigating. Enter Violet Coughlan. My brief and barrister extraordinaire with legs to die for. - Valentino Fagan, my favorite client. How are you this fine morning? - Oh, you know me, Violet. All the better for seeing you. You look great. - Thank you. - You smell even better. - You're such a charmer. So what can I help you with? - You fancy going for a spin? - I'm meant to meet some colleagues in the law library for lunch. But I'd be more than happy to make an exception for you. - Nice one. [steady music] [Val sighing] [Val gasping] Holy fuck! [Violet chuckling] I should have lunch like this with you more often. - Mm. Be my pleasure. - Fucking sure. - So, what was it you were asking me about again before we got carried away? - You know Bazza Hogg? - Oh yeah? - He got caught with gear last week, did he get bail on it? - Prosecution never objected to bail. They assumed the Guards would look for custody with a suspended sentence but they just looked for him to sign on twice daily, surrender his passport and a few other conditions. They'll probably go to trial but it'll be another year before that happens. - So even with a suspended sentence and caught with gear, he still got bail? - Yeah. - [Val Voiceover] I don't need any more convincing. [tense gloomy music] - [Liz] This is a right mess. - [Aisling] You think it could be over what he gave us on the TVs? - [scoffs] It's a strong possibility. - [Aisling] So what do we do from here? - We just have to wait and see what comes in. I mean, without the proper budget, this operation is moving at a snail's pace. All we have is Carrot, and I don't know if he can be trusted. Come on. [sighs] [telephone ringing] - Get that into you. Get in it! Get it, Tanya. - Oh yeah, that feels so good. Oh, I can feel it inside me. - Tanya, would you shut the fuck up? [Val sighing] - Is that it? - What do you mean, "Is that it?" - Well, you were very quick, what about me? - What about you? It's always about you! - You're a selfish fucking prick, Val. - Ask my bollocks. - Who was that ringing you? Is that one of your dirty little tramps? - You ever shut the fuck up? - I know you, Val Fagan, and I'm telling you now, if you arrive home here with something like fucking spotty dick I won't be going anywhere fucking near you. I hope it fucking falls off you, so I do. - Will you ever give it a rest? - How are you, Val? - Alright, Wellsy? - [Mark] Yeah, I have a proposal for you, yeah? Ever heard of a bloke called Decco Cunningham? [tense music] - [Val Voiceover] Wellsy tells me he got word that Decco Cunningham wants to meet me to buy in some of our next drug shipment from the proceeds of his tiger job. With the cops after seizing the TVs and a drought on shipments, I'm thinking a few quid from Decco wouldn't harm in helping towards the Corrigans' payment for the next shipment. I'm happy to see what Decco has to offer. But the Old Bill came for Decco first. - What the fuck is this? - [Val Voiceover] The story is that cops had got DNA for Kezza, one of Decco's crew, from the cardboard box he used to keep the wife in. - Right, down, get down! - Ah, Jesus Christ! Fuck! - [Guard] Now you're getting slapped. - [Henchman] Get off me! - [Val] They have fuck all on Decco but he gets it into his fucked up head that I stitched him up with the cops somehow. - Fagan, you rat bastard! - Get the fuck outta here. - [Guard] Stay down. - Shut the hell up! [Decco growling] - Fucking, you cunts, fuck off! [yells] I'll kill you all, I'll kill you! - [Val] Decco's time in the Old Bill's custody isn't quiet in any way. He's like a caged animal. - [Kevin] Search him. - [Guard] He's good. - Yeah. Get out, get out. Go, go, go. - Fucking- [door slamming] Come on! Come on, you fucking prick! I'll show you cunts, you prick! I'll find your home some night and I'll rape your wife! Oh, I'll fucking show you alright! - [Val] Cops didn't have enough to charge Decco with the tiger job so all he gets is a few Mickey Mouse charges like breach of the peace and public order. But I know it's only a matter of time before I cross paths with Decco again. [tense gloomy music] - Two secure holding areas. The first one is along here, I can get you out of there from the main- - [Val] Eventually the time comes where Renno makes contact to enlighten me with his master plan. And it's beautiful. - But he can only access from there from the main floor inside. - [Val Voiceover] It's a big job so we need extra pairs of hands to help us out. - [Val] You make sure you's weren't followed? - Yeah, all good. Took the back roads and all, eh? Left the cars out on the main road. - These the lads you were telling me about? - Ross and Eric, they're from the flats. Straight up, yeah. My nanny's block. - Know who I am? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Tell anyone you were coming here tonight? - No. - No. - Do as you're told, keep your mouth shut, there's a nice few quid in this for you's. Make sure Wellsy gives you plenty more work. But if you's open your fucking mouth about what's happening here tonight, I'll fucking kill you's. Alright? - Right, lads, phones out, turned off. Put them in the box there beside the table, yeah? Get them back after the job is done. - [Val Voiceover] Myself and Renno then give the rest of the crew the rundown on the job. - Somebody's gonna be distributing cash all over the city's ATMs for the bank holiday weekend. - Yeah, that's all well and good but how the fuck are we supposed to get into the place? [Mark whistling] - Jesus, lads. Where the fuck did you stroke this from? - It's not stolen. Renno built it. - Fuck! Fair play, Renno. - I hope you's all haven't made any plans for the next day or so, eh? We hit it in the morning. [tense dramatic music] - There we go. - Thanks, Mike. Fancy going for a drink? - Anything I need to know before I can stop? - I don't know, but I have to work for the 3rd? - Yeah. You have to. - I'll have that on your desk in about half an hour. - Yeah. - Thanks. - [Security Guard] How's your gran? [door knocking] - Jane Cleary. Got a message for you here, Jane. My associate has your kids now. If you don't open this door, if you hit the panic or distress alarms, he will throw acid in your kids' faces. Now, open the fucking door! Good girl, Jane. You, Eric? - Steve. - Right, face down on the deck, now. All set here. [tense dramatic music] [gun clicking] - Here we go, couple of minutes. [gate buzzing] Right, we're in. Lads, get ready, ballies on. - There's a delay with that consignment, Davy, so I wouldn't worry about it 'til later on, anyway. Have we got one back already, Davy? - I'm not sure. I can double check with control if you want? - Yeah, have a look and see what the craic is, man. - Yeah. Hub 4 to Control, there's an empty 168 back for its next pickup. - Right. You, up, now. Go on, quickly. Want to see these two again, yeah? Go on then. Give the command to let the van in the gates. Understand? - Roger, Hub 4. You can let them in. [tense music] [gate squealing] - Fucking stay there! - Hands where I can see them, that's it, good boy, good boy. - Get on the fucking wall. Get the fuck down! Now, now! [all clamoring] - Up against the wall! - Go on, do it! - Check the offices, check the offices! - Eyes against the fucking wall! - Get your fucking hands in the air! - You, get up, let's go, before I smash your bleeding teeth in! - Come on. Move it, move it. Come on! - Make sure they're on tight. Tight as you can. [all clamoring] - Get down! Get fucking down, give me your hands! - Stay there! - Stay up against that fucking wall. - [Carrot] Turn around before I clatter you. - [Cushty] Fucking move now, you little tossers. No looking. - Who's the manager? Are you in charge? I said, which one of you is the fucking man- - Me. - Up. Look at me. You have the keys and the codes to the cash office, yes? We're gonna go down and you're gonna open that. One wrong move and I will put a bullet in your fucking head. - Hey! - Hey! [all clamoring] - [Cushty] Eyes on the fucking wall! - You wanna switch on, you dozy fucking freak, alright? - Bring have-a go-hero over here. Get that out the van. It seems like one of your staff fancied themselves as a bit of a hero. So just to prove my point that we don't fuck around. - [Hero] No, please, please. No! - Don't fucking look, don't fucking look! - Now, unless you want his burnt remains on your conscience, you'll do exactly as I say! Now, move! You're with me. [tense music] Why are they all in 100 euro notes? - The banks want them in large denominations for the ATMs so the customers will spend more. - Robbing bastards. All those bankers should be fucking locked up, so they should. Open it. [keypad beeping] Move. Stay here. Go. Right. Let's get to work. - That's all of it. [door knocking] - Let's go. We're outta here. [gate buzzing] - [Val Voiceover] Like candy from a fucking baby. - That was fucking great! I'm fucking pumped here, I am. - [Val] Carrot! - What? - I've been thinking about something, right? It's about those TVs. Bazza Hogg knew about the TVs, he didn't know about the lockup. How did the cops find out about the lockup? Did they see you hanging around it? - No chance, Val. - You're saying you took those TVs to yourself, Carrot, what? - Nah, Carrot wouldn't anything like that, sure he wouldn't. We'll have a proper chat about it later, yeah? - Sure thing, Val. - This'll do us here. - Ross. - Yeah? - Jump down, give Wellsy a hand with them tools. Sorry, young thing. I just don't trust you's. [gunshot echoing] - [Newsreader] Held staff at gunpoint before stealing a large quantity of cash. Sources say the raid was carried out with military precision and the haul taken during the raid is believed to be in the region of 5.5 million euros. [phone buzzing] - Hello? - [Carrot] I need fucking witness protection, do you hear me? - Carrot. Where are you? We were supposed to be meeting an hour ago. - He's fucking onto me. He knows about the fucking televisions and he's gonna have me fucking clipped. Do you hear me? - Listen, calm down, alright? What's going on? - Are you listening to me? He's fucking onto me, that's what's fucking up! - Where are you now? - Just around the corner from my fucking gaff. - Okay. Stay on the line. Cigire? It's Carrot. He's rattled, he wants to come in. - Dennis. It's Liz Delahunt. What's the story? - [Carrot] He's fucking onto me, yeah? I know he is. Whatever you's want, statements, the money from today's stroke, I can get it for you's, yeah? - The money from today's cash depot robbery? - Fucking Renno planned the lot, fucking us and Val pulled it off, I just seen him blow the fucking head off some young blonded job 'cause he didn't fucking trust him, do you hear me? Look, I need you's to help here, yeah? Just fucking bring me in, right? Get me all sorted with witness fucking protection. - Okay, Dennis, you just go in home, right now and we will be there as soon as we can, okay? - [Carrot] Yeah. Yeah. - Okay, take Aisling and get around there, right now. - Yeah. - Go. - [Val] It's hard to believe that Delahunt has us all. With Carrot's evidence I'm looking at the rest of my life locked up. But sometimes divine intervention comes in the strangest of ways. [taser crackling] Decco Cunningham. - No! No, no, no! [door knocking] - And he definitely said he'd meet us here? And his phone is off? - Yeah, I'm just getting voicemail. I've a feeling something bad's about to happen. [tense music] - You know that shit of yours. [Carrot gasping] [all clamoring] - [Val] After being lifted for the tiger job, Decco has the daggers out for us all. - Yeah, you! Yeah! [Carrot gasping] - [Val] He starts with Carrot and has plans to work his way up to me. - You'd better be back with that creepy looking fucker, alright? - Cut him down, Arthur. - [Val] I don't even want to begin to describe what Carrot is going through. Firstly to be beaten to a pulp, and then. - [Decco] Over there, and get his kecks down. Val Fagan's little bitches, all you were. Now you're my bitch. - [Val] Let's just say that Decco wants to have his enjoyment and his way with Carrot. How some can afflict such sadistic brutality on another is beyond me. - Come here. Come here. - [Val] And you might think that Decco just spared me a long stretch inside. [gunshot echoing] But all I know is that he just declared war. As for the robbery, the cops have to look like they're doing something about it. So the knock on the door is inevitable. - Armed Gardai! Don't move, face down! - [Val] They come into our gaffs. - Armed Gardai, armed Gardai, get your hands up! Keep your hands up! - Don't move! - [Val] Turn them upside down. [tense music] - Get your fucking hands off! Don't touch me, I'm telling you now, don't fucking- - [Val] Then haul us off for questioning. They section us with the usual 24 hours of bullshit. And we sit in silence. We know the Gardai don't have a scratch of evidence on us. - [Kevin] I'll ask you the same question, Mr. Fagan. - [Val Voiceover] They're just going through the motions. And so are we. [dramatic music] Once the dust settles I'm on cloud nine. 5.5 million richer and I'm very happy. Untouchable. And it feels fucking great. - Ah, what do you want? - Mind if I sit down? - Have you not got nothing better to be doing? You searched my gaff and you questioned me. You can fuck off if you think I'm buying you a coffee. I've no cash on me. - Let me introduce Detective Goff from the Criminal Assets Bureau. - Valentino Fagan, consider yourself served with a tax bill for 1.2 million euros in unpaid revenue fees made for the past six years. I suggest you have your solicitors contact us. - Unpaid tax? - Hm. - You know what I think of that, don't you? Bullshit. Do you know what I'll do to keep you's all happy? Being the upstanding citizen that I am. I'll pay the tax man back a few quid. But 1.2 million? You can fuck off. - Hm. That is very gracious. But then again I don't suppose it puts much of a dent in five and a half million. - As I told you yesterday, I wouldn't know anything about that. It was some stroke though, wasn't it? I mean, if the man who pulled off that job walked in here now, I'd have to congratulate him and buy him a pint. - You think you're a really big man, don't you? You don't give a fuck about anyone. Do you seriously think that the reign of the great Val Fagan is going to last forever? 'Cause let me tell you something, it's only a matter of time before someone smarter and more dangerous comes and takes you out. - Cheerio now, Elizabeth, you have a lovely day. [tense music] - [Val Voiceover] Poor Liz. I often wonder what kind of life she has away from her work. But being so driven and committed to catching me, how could she? And what's eating her now is she was a split hair away from taking me down. Carrot was her trump card. And it didn't play thanks to Decco. [tense music] And when I'm told about Carrot's sickening demise, well let's just say the gloves are off. - That foreskin-faced prick. - Word is Decco thinks you set him up with the Old Bill after he pulled the tiger job. - I don't give a fuck what he thinks. That stupid cunt has a pop at us and he thinks we're gonna take it lying down? Tool up and do what needs to be done. If he wants a war, we'll fucking bring it to him. [tense gloomy music] [gunshots echoing] Out of Decco's crew we've two of them taken care of in a matter of days. With one of them locked up on remand over the tiger job. All that leaves is Decco. - I know, Ma. No, he didn't mean to slap me. [speaks in Gaelic] I'll talk to them all tomorrow, alright? [door clattering] - Alright now! Decco Cunningham, where is he? - What? Who are you? - Tell me where he is or I'll put a fucking bullet in your head! - Which flat is Cunningham's? - Number 23, first floor. It's his girlfriend's house. - [sighs] I fucking hate serving these gym forms on gowzers. We're doing our thing by informing them of a threat on their lives and they normally slam the door in our face. You coming? - I'll follow you up, I'm gonna run a check on that car there. - Fair enough. - Oh, fuck! - I haven't seen him! - Don't lie to me. - I'm not, I swear! Last time he was here was two days ago. - He's not fucking here. - You tell that prick he's a fucking dead man! [tense dramatic music] [gunfire echoing] - Oh, fuck! - Gardai, stop! Ah, fuck! - Where did he go? - Out there. - [Val] With the Old Bill on high alert after we clipped the other two of Decco's crew, I'm not surprised about the close call. But it's too close for Wellsy. Although he's smart enough to dump anything that can link him to what just happened. - Stop the car. It's Mark Wells. - [Val] So the cops grab Wellsy and pull him in for questioning. They give him a proper going over. Taking photographs, fingerprints. DNA. And they seize his clobber. Between the movers and the shakers, we're able to get rid of the gun and the bally that Wellsy dumped before the cops could find them. But with the gun residue on him, the cops have enough to charge him. And with a firearms charge, Wellsy knows that he's looking at a stint in custody. - Tom. - Amazing work on getting Mark Wells, Liz. But this doesn't read well. As of now, you've got unlimited budget to go after Fagan himself. Do whatever it takes. [Elizabeth sighing] - I've a few things to do today so I'm just gonna drop you at your nanny's first, alright? - Okay. - Make sure you put your seatbelt on. What? - Good afternoon, Mr. Fagan. We just wanna see how you are today. - What? - We just wanna be sure that you're okay and that no harm comes to you. - Whatever, you bleeding dope, you. So, you wanna get a tattoo? - Yeah, like the one on your neck. - You wanna get a tattoo of the Grim Reaper? - What's the Grim Reaper? - The Grim Reaper is a ghost that appears to you just before you're about to die. - Well, do you want to know what I want to be when I'm older? A detective. - A fucking Garda? [Luca giggling] [speaks in Gaelic] You're just winding your old man up. Fuck's sake. Fuck's sake. Bloody scumbag bastards. What the fuck are you's at? This is fucking harassment, this is. - No need to be alarmed, sir. We're just concerned for your safety. With you being such an upstanding citizen, we're obliged to provide you with all the protection and safety within our power, 24/7. - Is this what Delahunt is at now, is it? I tell you's, you's are some shower of fucking cunts. - Please watch your language, sir. It's an offense to use threatening, abusive, or insulting language in a public place. - Fuck off. [gloomy music] - They're following me everywhere I go. They're behind me everywhere I go! It's harassment. It's nothing short of harassment. - [Violet] Look, Val, we'll lodge a complaint with GSOC and I'll write to the Chief Superintendent about this. We'll go through the necessary channels. - The ne, fuck the necessary channels, Violet! Just get it sorted! [door knocking] - Alright? Do you know there's a bleeding unmarked cop car sitting out there? - Course I know, you bleeding bullet head! Fucking pricks have been following me around all day. What's the story with that? - It's gonna be in a cast for eight weeks, they're saying. Had to put a fucking pin in it and all. Could be worse, couldn't it? I might be laid up for a little bit, least I'm not banged up like Wellsy was. - Shut the fuck up! Cops could have this place bugged or something. - Jesus, you're hitting the sniff pretty hard there, Val. - Give it a fucking rest, Cushty, will you? You sound like my poxy wife. And you needn't think I'm paying your medical bills for that, either! [tense dramatic music] [Val sniffing heavily] Fucking pricks. - Are they still hanging around outside? Are you not in court today for that Mickey Mouse road traffic thing? At least you'll have your own personal Garda escort to take you to the court. - Are you trying to be fucking funny? 'Cause instead of trying to be funny, why don't you clean the gaff? It's like a fucking tip. [tense music] - Val, it's only two penalty points and a 150 euro fine. - It should've been fucking dismissed. Useless, you are. What the fuck do I even pay you for? - You don't pay me, Val, you're on free legal aid. - [Val] Good. - Bad day in court today, Val? - Fucking tan your hole and get out of my face, I'm not in the mood. - [Val Voiceover] This shite the cops are at really has me on the edge and I need to do something about it. [doorbell ringing] - [Esther] How are you, Val? - [Val] Is he in? - [Esther] Yeah, come on in. - You alright? - A word. - What's the story? - The story is I can't take the bullshit off these pricks anymore. - Who? - Delahunt and them fucking dull birds down there. They follow me everywhere I go, 24/7, I can't even take a fucking shite with that prick Hogan waving at me through the window. - Sure, this will all die down in a week or so, pal. - Don't fucking play this down, Renno, there's work to be done. Corrigans' are coming in in a day or two to get their money and I can't be seen going around with them, with them fucking pricks up my hole every five minutes. I want this sorted and I want this sorted now. - What do you want done? - A car bomb. For that bitch Delahunt. You build it. Or your mates from the RA build it, I don't really give a fuck but I want her blown to fuck by the middle of next week. It'll send a message out to the rest of the Guards, they'll back the fuck off. - Are you out of your fucking mind? You're talking about intentionally taking out a cop. - I don't give a fuck, Renno. Blame it on the RA or something. - Look, man, I can see you're wound up about this whole situation but if we kill a cop we'll cause a serious shitstorm that will last for years. They'll be putting our doors in every morning, turning our lives upside down 'til they eventually get us. And they will get us. Val, look here. - Renno, this isn't a fucking request. I want it done. - Look, pal. You need to think straight here, you need to- - No, Renno. You need to think straight here. You need to think about what I'm fucking telling you to do! And if you don't do what I'm telling you to do, well then, you start thinking about your own safety. And the safety of your fucking little pretty wife in there. - So that's what this has come down to now, is it, Val? Fucking threats? - Take it whatever the fuck way you want it. All's I'm telling you is, get it fucking done! [gloomy music] [door slamming] - I see you still have that poxy look on your face from this morning, so I presume you got the penalty points. - What did you say to me, you fucking tramp?! You dirty slut! I'm out there breaking my bollocks every day to put a roof over your head and clothes on your back and I have to come here and listen to this shite from you! If it wasn't for me you'd be out sucking cocks down at the canal! [door knocking] - Everything okay? We heard screaming and shouting. - Everything is fine, now fuck off! - Are you okay? - Who the fuck do you think you are? Get off my property. - Do you want to come with us? We can get you a safe place to stay. - She's going fucking nowhere, she's staying here. - Fuck off and mind yours own business. It's you's that have him up the fucking walls like this. - You're a very brave man, aren't you? I bet you feel like a real hero slapping up women. - I will fucking slap you up and down that road out there, you prick. - Oh yeah? Give it your best shot then! - Come on, take off your badge and gun, then! - No problem, let's go right now! - Come on. He's not worth it. - Go on, fuck off, you prick. [gloomy sinister music] - Are you okay? [Alan sighing] Is it to do with Val? - You know, I'm starting to think that for every bad decision someone makes, it will eventually come back to haunt them. Esther, if we don't get out now, we're gonna be- - What do you mean, get out? - I mean, cut loose. Get away from all of this. - Like, emigrate? - We've plenty of cash, we can move abroad, anywhere. - Alan. Are you sure that's what you really want to do? - Just hit me today. Seeing how Val has become, especially when he tried dragging you into this mess. - And what? What do you think Val is gonna say about all this? About us going? - I'm gonna have a word with him tomorrow. Everything we've been through, I think he's owes me this much. - And what if he says no? You know I would do anything for you. Absolutely anything. - We'll sort something out, yeah? We always do. [somber music] [door knocking] - You wanted to see me, Tom? - Ah, Liz. Come in. Take a seat. - What's the problem? - This latest overt surveillance on Fagan. I need you to back off. - What? - Fagan is threatening to sue for breach of civil liberties and harassment. - Tom. Fagan is on the verge of cracking. - I'm sorry, Liz, it's not up for negotiation. Look, maybe there are other ways to get at Fagan. Have a look at the international aspect of his operation, right? [tense dramatic music] - [Val] With the Corrigans coming over today, I'm buzzing 'cause everything's gonna come good finally. Decco's gone to ground and probably left the country. And the cops have eased off. Once Delahunt is out of the way it'll be plain sailing. Everything's falling into place nicely. - You alright? What's the story? - Did you get that done? - Sorted. Fitted with a mercury tilt trigger switch mounted underneath the driver's seat. Go off as soon as she sits in it. - Nice one. - Esther and me are going away, Val. Going away for good. - What do you mean? - This cop hit, it's my last job. I'm done. - Renno, what the fuck are you talking about? - It means I'm done, Val. Finished with all of this. It's like that cop Delahunt said to you before, it's only a matter of time before someone smarter and bolder comes along, takes us all out. I'm sick of looking over my shoulder the whole time, Val. I don't wanna go out like that. Quit while you're ahead, do you know what I mean? - So you're gonna run away like a little chicken shit? - For fuck's sake, Val. I don't wanna fall out with you over this. Been through enough together, pal, you and me. - Fuck it, Renno. You deserve a break, you and Esther head off and have a good think about it and then get back to me. - Sorry, Val, I've already thought it over. I'm done. Finished, for good. - Okay, so. So be it. Best of luck, pal. - Thanks, Val. For everything that you've done for me. I appreciate it, I'm grateful. - Oh, how are you, Renno? - Hey. - Are you not staying? - Nah, just popped in for a quick chat with himself. - Alright, I'll see you later, yeah? I'm starving, doing my head in. Let's get something to eat. Come on, I'll see to you. Right, come on. - [Val Voiceover] Fuck you, Renno. And your wife. Worried that someone smarter and bolder is gonna take us out? Not in my city. [tense music] And you think you and your wife can just up and leave? There's only one place you's are going. - Hang on, they're just coming through now. Cigire? The intel report from Interpol arrived. - Oh, thanks, Aisling. [tense music] [cellphone ringing] - Yeah? He's in the pub. [tense music] - So what is it? - American. Executive class. - Very fancy. - Oh yeah. - I tell you, as soon as this meeting is over, I'm gonna get myself one of them Latvian ladies. - What, them escorts? - Yeah. I'm dying for my hole. - You, that's all you ever fucking think of, you and your hole. [explosion booming] [car alarms wailing] [tense dramatic music] - Look, Dad, it's the Grim Reaper. [gunshots echoing] [tense music] - Now, get everything out. I'm sorry I'm doing it this morning. Get the fuck out. [suppressed gunfire popping] [bullets clinking] [tense music] - [Val] Gangland. The dark side of society. The underbelly of everyday life is a real and dark place where even the innocent suffer. And being the boss of this place isn't about how much money you have or how much power you have. But it's about how long you can stay alive when you're at the top. This is how long I last. - It's all yours now. [dramatic music]
