Woman: What time is your reservation for? Man: 7:30. I'll pick you up at 7:00. WomaGreat. See you later. See you. Whoa, late night last night, Doctor? Too late. - You and Harry Handsome? - Mm-hm. Now, what was he in again, Lisa? - Plastic surgery? - Podiatry. Oh, yeah, right-- feet, what the world needs most. Not today, Charlie. I'm already on ER duty. In that dress? ( indistinct conversations ) ( mambo music blaring ) Big day at the park, man! Zenuca's gonna be there with his band. Bet you these chicks from Orient Street be there. I'm out. Got a little juice? No. No? Oh, man. Come on. I said no! Oh, man. ( both grunting ) ( shouting indistinctly ) What's the matter with you?! We need some help! Get off of me! ( indistinct shouting ) Where to? ( shouting continues ) - What happened? - He freaked out. Beat up his cousin, trashed the apartment good. - On drugs? - That, we don't know. 15 milligrams Haldol IM, stat! That's it. Watch, he bites. Come on! Let me go! Hold him still. Hold him down. Hold him down! Please help! Okay, when he's quiet, take blood, get a drug screen. ( grunting ) Can you tell me anything about him? Doctor, it was like walking into a chain saw. - Wasn't much conversation. - Last name is Lopez. We got to go back and write it up. I guess I might as well take my hat, cuffs and my belt. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. What happens when the shot wears off? I hate to put him in restraints. Yeah, but if he comes up swinging? Yeah. - Well, he's under arrest? - Arrest? I guess we could have. But with the family disputing us-- his aunt says he's a good kid and he just went sick in the head. The aunt won't press charges, so here we are. All right, turn him over. Sit him up. Okay. There, now, this is just until we see how you are. He's all yours. Hey, man, let's get going. He kept me up all night long. Don't listen to him, Doctor. He tried to hide it, but I could hear it. - He's making trouble again. - ( whistles ) It's that damn college song. Tell him not to do that. Is that true, Mr. Gore? Well, he didn't have to listen. What is it that kept you up? Well, a bit nervous about getting out. He's lying. He was worried about foreign policy. - No, I was not! - You were. When you weren't whispering, you were muttering that-- - that damn speech-- - Mind your own business. Looks like Poore's had a setback. Shall I up his medication again, back to 30 milligrams? Nothing wrong with that. Just means that's the level he needs. You can still send him out Friday. - What? - Why not? - He's not dangerous. - No? What if he goes back to New York again and tries to address the U.N.? They'll lock him up and send him back to us. Rough 'em up and turf 'em out. You know a better way? We'll up his medication even higher. Till we find the right level? ( sighs ) - Ugh, no. - Oh, yes. - He's waiting for you in iso room. - Why me? Why couldn't he have given him to Parley? Parley's on overload as is. Just take Sergeant Benny with you and keep your distance. Mr. Zamora? I'm Dr. DaVito. Mm, a lady doctor. How are you feeling? Not bad. I like the color. But... it fits a little tight. Can you tell me how you got here? On the bus? ( chuckles ) The police brought you here on the bus? Can you tell me what happened? Nothing. Do you remember anything? Yeah. You put me in this thing. You were violent. How are you feeling now? Calm. Nice and calm. I'm nice and quiet now. Can you can get me out of this thing? What happened to your cousin? Look, you wanna talk, get me out of this and we'll talk. You're not angry? You're in control of yourself? Yes, Teacher. Boo! ( laughs ) Public enemy number one. ( chuckles ) Hey, you like to dance? Take you... dancing sometime. Show you some... moves. I mean soreal moves. Are you sure you're a doctor? I mean, too pretty to be a doctor. ( chuckles ) I know what he's up to. He's saying, "Hey, lady, I'm no freak-o mental patient. I'm this big macho lover." While the doctor understands that, but the person is grossed out. ( chuckles ) "You're too pretty to be a doctor." I haven't had that since med school. Yeah, I'm the one who's too pretty to be a doctor. Now, that is true. Yeah! ( growls ) One more year, baby, we are out of here. Oh... California. Here we come. Nice healthy neurotics. With ingrown toenails. And treatable problems. We'll play tennis. And have gorgeous, suntanned babies. Who'll both be named after me. Steven and Stephanie, of course. Of course, and a dog, big black Labrador retriever. And he'll be named after me. ( both chuckle ) I'm so backed up, it's silly. Anyhow, here's what I got from the family. Frederick Zamora, born in Puerto Rico, oldest of five kids. Mother ill, so he's sent to live up here with an aunt because he'd have a better chance. Now, get this-- straight-A student through grade school, first year of high school, honor society, won an art award, everything. Then three years ago, his mother died. Went into a tailspin, started getting withdrawn, dropped out of school, then this incident. So whatever else your macho man is, he's no dummy. - Cat. - Bird. - Stone. - Drugs. Get stoned. Book. You're from Connecticut, right? Your father is a big insurance guy down there. Maybe I'll meet him sometime. Father. And your boyfriend, Dr. Steven Nelson, who works over at St. Theresa's Hospital, is he from Connecticut, too? I scare you, don't I? "Oh, wow, how does he find out all these things?" Why would you want to scare me? If I can't love you, I got to do something. Hey, kid, you're ruining my business. What do you mean? Freddie Zamora, I was just up to see him, you know, read him his rights, see if he wants to get sprung. He wouldn't hear of it. He's having the time of his life. Well, he ought to be. He has to work out on me every day. - How do you mean? - ( sighs ) He's got a new game to add to his macho lover routine. It's called "scare the doctor." He knows where Steve works. He knows our plans. How'd he find out? Mm, patients? Staff? Who knows. He's one of those clever types that can get people to talk. So do your number on him. My number? Dope him up and send him out. You know, Charlie, this is the one time I'd really love to do that, but I can't. I'm evaluating him to see if he's still violent, and I can't take the chance of masking any symptoms, so every day I sit across from him wondering if I say the wrong thing or make the wrong gesture, if this ticking bomb will go off. Well, he's quiet since he's here. A few more days of the same, maybe discharge him to outpatient. Without really knowing if he's still violent? Well, no, I guess not. Well, so what the hell? It's a couple of weeks with Sergeant Benny riding shotgun. Come on, what's a couple of weeks to you? You got it made. A couple of years, you and Harry Handsome will have nice little practices out in California, mornings in the office, afternoons on the beach, and nights... under the stars. Charlie, how have I offended you? You haven't. Well, then why the constant needle? Well, let's just say I can spot a silver spoon a mile away. That. Where you going? You haven't eaten. Rich girls don't eat, Charlie. They just ride horses. Man: Frederick Zamora. Cardiology, fine. Nothing from blood chemistry. Thank you. Well? Well, no hallucinations. He's not delusional. His reality testing is good, even to the point of making veiled little threats. Medical insurance? None, which makes him another Medicaid patient, which elicited yet another note from the Review Committee. I know, I know. We're over-admitted on Medicaid patients. In which they request we ship across town to Rexford Lutheran, but Rexford Lutheran's no fool. The boy is violent and they don't want him, thanks for calling. Well, maybe we want him. Poor and violent. Sounds like our cup of tea, huh, Lisa? - Where are you with it? - Oh. He put a guy in the hospital. I still don't know why. For all I know, he had a temporal lobe seizure. EEG is pending. I... want to fully evaluate him. Do it. What about the Review Committee? I'll deal with them. Anything else? Yes, those hospital beds you added out in the hall. Those patients are getting up at night and walking around. Night staff can't follow them. Oh, brother. Well, increase their meds so they sleep through. Let me go, man! - Come on-- - I said no! Just a little fun. You wanna go to the bathroom? You wanna go to the bath-- Hey, Freddie, let him go! Let him go! Take it easy. Calm down. Freddie! Get off him! Freddie! Come on. Fred... what if I hadn't been there? You've got to learn to trust me. Yeah, I guess. Scared and alone. Not here. Alone? What is it, Fred? I'm so scared. Of what? Of me. He's afraid of himself when he gets angry. He knows he loses control. He hurts people, and he hates himself for it. It just poured out of him. He's a kid. A frightened kid. All that time, he had me scared. Well, he is scary. Then all of a sudden he's just a-- just a kid. Yeah? Is that all? Yeah. Why do you ask? He seems to get to you a lot more than the other patients, that's all. I don't know. I think they all get to me. All right. All right, he's just another patient. Freddie: My mother was a saint. My old man, he was a joke. He had this cow, she was all he cared about. When she had a baby, a calf, and the calf caught a cold, he put it in my bed. I'd sleep on the floor. He'd stay up all night with that calf, and I caught a cold on the floor. But your mother was a saint. She was always sick, but she always looked after me. Who was it that decided to send you up to the States? Well, your father was with his cow. She got too sick to look after the others and me. There were better schools up here, so I came. How did you feel about it? Fine. And Sonia? Fine. Cousin Ronnie? Fine. So why'd you send him to the hospital, because everything was fine? Look, I don't care about Ronnie, okay? He's not Sonia's favorite, but I'm used to that. What about you? How does she treat you? Um, I'm sorry about the other day. Forget about it. No, no, no. You were right. I'm a snob, a blue-collar snob. And envious. Of what? Your money. I love money. You? Charlie Daimler for the people? Yeah. I dream of it. Steaks, yachts, fancy clothes. Clothes? You? ( chuckles ) Yeah. Well, your suits, they're rumpled. Do you sleep in them? Or do you just scrunch them up every morning before dressing? Or you just buy them at the rumpled suit store? You're not the only one who can throw zingers. ( laughs ) That's good. You give as good as you get. That's great. ( laughs ) It was all blown up to be more than it was. It was just a little argument. Ronnie slipped. He would say so anywhere. Look at him. How could he do that to someone as big as Ronnie? Fred, is that what happened? L-Look. This is what Freddie does. He designs things. Freshman year. Remember, Freddie? These are very good. Aunt: You should go back to them, Frederico. It's a good trade for you. What's that all about? He's terrible. Look, we love... We'll do anything for Freddie. But... well, the landlord, we're having trouble with him over the apartment, and he'll do anything to kick us out. Good morning, where's a good place for us to talk? Freddie! Freddie! Help me! You're a bitch! You're dead! You're dead! I'm gonna kill you! ( Freddie's shouting fading ) The point is, I didn't see it coming. I mean, I knew he was angry with his family, but I never thought... It was that-- that moment at the end, when his aunt took me aside. I never should have let her do that. He read it that I was with her and planning to dump him. So he went off and brooded about it, and in our next session... Well, as we say in France, rookie mistake. Luckily no one was hurt. Question now is what do we do with Mr. Zamora? Well, I'd say the evaluation is complete. He's violent and dangerous. Look, for all we know, that was an isolated episode. We could watch him for a bit, then send him out on a pass, see how he does. Hook him up with a halfway house if his folks don't want him. Make a referral to the outpatient clinic. Now, Dr. Parley, let's don't send people out of here so fast. He did physically assault someone. He almost got Lisa. Now, we've got him for another 30 days on the involuntary commitment. - Is that right, Charlie? - If he doesn't contest it. - Uh-huh. - Excuse me, Dr. Butler, but if we've got Mr. Zamora here and he's not violent for the 30 days that we've got him, then we send him out, right? Yes, if all you can do is go by the book. Well, excuse me, Doctor, isn't that why the book was written? I mean, isn't that our job? And if it is, it strikes me that what we need to do is try to get 30 nonviolent days out of Mr. Zamora. Dr. Parley, strikes me that you wrote the book. Okay, if you go that way, standard medication is 10 milligrams haloperidol twice a day. Or if you wanna make sure, 15. Excuse me, but I said that he was a danger to himself and others. And we said not if he's medicated. Yeah, what if he stops taking his medication once he's out? Why should he? Because he's 18 years old, full of piss and vinegar, and does not want to spend his days zombie-eyed. And most importantly, doesn't think, except in moments of extreme anguish, that there's anything wrong with him. Now, Lisa, what is it that you want? Now, do you want to send him upstate, custodial care at the warehouse by the waters? He'll rot there. Do you want to put him on a bus to Phoenix, let them worry about him out there? He'll get much less supervision than here. - What? - Look, he's dangerous. Don't let him out. Keep him. I'm trying to, but there are problems. Now, look, I share your concern, but there's only so much we can do. I just can't issue orders. There's a hospital full of patients here. There's a system that runs the hospital-- - That just got hit with a Medicaid cut-- - Claire, please. There's only so much we can do or you. Now we've got him for 30 days, yeah? Let's see what happens. Yeah. But as to medication, five milligrams twice a day. I don't want him zonked. Five milligrams as you say. All right, we got work to do. Let's go, come on, work, work. Butler's right, what more can you do? ( sighs ) I don't know. But I don't feel good. Well, of course, you don't. You've been through one hell of a scary event. You've got all kinds of emotions churning around inside of you. It's time for you to lay out, let them all sift down. Maybe. I don't know. Lisa, you did your job. You evaluated him... the hard way. - Well, he's still my patient. - To do what with? I don't know. Nothing. Let it go. In a month, he's gone. No, he's not gone. He's out here with you and me and all that anger lurking deep down. Lisa... are all situations solvable? No. Are you responsible for all situations? No. Look, I know this is gonna sound cruel, but sometimes the best thing you can do in these situations is just walk away. If you don't, they'll chew you up, they'll spit you out, and they won't give a damn you were ever there. My folks as an example. 40 years in the Chicago school system because they believed, and how did they end up? Broken and ignored. Not for you, hon. Not for me. Cool him, huh? Yeah. ( laughter, toy squeaking ) Now. You'll get your meds here at 8:00 in the morning and 4:00 in the afternoon. Right. And you have to take them when you receive them. - All right? - Yeah. ( sighs ) I guess that's it. You make it through the next four weeks without... anything happening-- Home free. ( softly ) Yeah. Doctor? Uh, Lisa. I'm sorry about... Well, I was partly to blame. I would never want to hurt you. I know. Get your pill. I'll see you later. Hey, there's my doctor. Doctor, where you been? I ain't seen you around last couple days. I was on emergency room duty. How are you? Me? Top of the line. 23 days to go then, boom, I'm gone. I know. Hey, Mr. Kelly, where you taking my doctor to? Hey, Mr. Kelly, how about a little Top 40 radio, huh? - Freddie! - We do this all the time. - I play DJ on his teeth radio. - He has no radio on his teeth. But he thinks he does, so why not make it a nice radio? - Right, Mr. K? - Freddie, sing. See? Yeah. ( softly ) Yeah. Oh, it's all right. Okay, Mr. K, what's it gonna be? - Andy Williams? - Who? - Christmas? - Christmas. Silent... Oh, silent. "Silent Night," right? All right, I'm gonna have to fake it a little, okay? Here we go. ♪ Silent night ♪ ♪ Holy night ♪ ♪ All is purple ♪ ♪ All is white... ♪ Now, Mr. Kelly, we're not from the FBI. I am Dr. DaVito. You know me. You know me. Dr. Felzer is going to take the bad tooth out. - ( grunts ) - He'll show it to you. He'll give to you so you know you haven't lost it. Okay. Freddie, sing. Uh... ♪ Silent night♪ - ♪ Holy night ♪ - ( humming "Silent Night" ) ♪ Sarge on your left ♪ ♪ Benny on your right ♪ ♪ And this swell dentist will fix you up right ♪ ♪ So your radio will stop giving advice ♪ ♪ You'll sleep in heavenly peace ♪ ♪ Sleep like a horse on its feet. ♪ Now get him to open his mouth. ( laughter ) It's crazy. Well, maybe, but I wanna try. Well, there is no time, for God's sake. The involuntary's up in 20 days. Then he's out of here. Not if I get him to sign a voluntary, right, Charlie? Right. This is a training hospital, right? And training hospitals will provide psychotherapy patients for their resident psychiatrists. Well, I want Freddie for my training patient, for however long I need to work with him, a week or one year. Lisa, please. I think she's done her homework, Doc. You've got Roger Kelly here on a long-term basis. And a few others. Why not one more? Do you know who Roger Kelly is? He's the brother of the president of the city council which just happens to write our budget every year. Now pardon me, but in the eyes of this hospital, - who is Freddie Zamora? - No one. A person with no money, no clout, but he is alive and treatable. And if I can convince him to stay... ( sighs ) Come on in. Lisa, I've been with you since you came here and all the way on this case, but do you realize what you're asking? First of all, we've got to get by the director of training. Then because it's medically unusual, we have to face all the experts on the kitchen cabinet. Then most fun of all, because Freddie is on Medicaid, we get to do battle with the Review Committee. - Think about it. - I have thought about it. Think about the recommendations you'll want when you leave here. I have thought about it! And I'm thinking about this hospital. What if Freddie gets out now and does something out there? ( sighs ) All right. All right. Then just about Freddie. Look, we all know that we spend most of our time here with people we can't really help, but then along comes somebody like Freddie, who could really have a life, who could really contribute to the lives of others. Now, he is standing at the crossroads. One way, he ends up a zombie like the men here, and the other way, we help him to a full, productive life. Don't we have some responsibility to him? He'll never agree to it. But if he does, okay. You always known how to read my mind? What can you do in 20 days? Damned if I know, but I better get going. Thought we'd have a drink after work. What's it to you, huh? What did you care? You split from here every night, you go dancing, dining, you do things. And what? You walk out. And what? What do I do, Freddie? You leave me here. Like who? Sonia? Like no one. Like you. I'm your little plaything, your little hobby till you get out of here. Oh, I see. I pretend to care for you and then I leave. Like everyone else. Everyone who? ( chuckles softly ) Who. Hoo, hoo, hoot. You're an owl! Get off my case. No! Stop bugging me. I can't, Freddie. I'm gambling, and time is running out. You have to talk to me. Let things out. Why? So that you'll touch the hurt and know that it's there. So that you'll stay so we can clean it out. Let it... out. Right. What if I was to tell you that one time, me and my aunt, we-- why not, man? I was 14. Her husband had gone, sister had just died. She loves her nephew. ( chuckles softly ) He was crying. She was crying. So she takes him in her bed, you know. No one else knows. And... they, like, comfort each other. This happens a few times, so she just like wakes up and decides it's wrong. Or I guess she put a stop to it. But she starts paying all this attention to Ronnie. Let's make life complete. She starts icing the very nephew she was loving. You. Me. Now you wanted to know. And now you know. Now you don't ask me anything else because if you do, I got moves of my own. I know where you live. 110 Cobble Street, right? You let me be, man, or I'll hurt you. ( door opens, closes ) He tells me this whole story as if it is the whole story, and then he threatens me if I ask more, why? - You believe the story? - Well, it doesn't matter. He feels betrayed by Sonia. Even if his story isn't literally true, even if they never made love, he was the rejected lover, hurt and enraged. Period. End of report. Well, then why the warning? Haven't you ever heard of a patient getting scared? He's backing off, throwing up the walls. Right. Right. Psych 101. ( chuckles ) Keep me posted. ( car engine starts ) Good, Mr. Zakis. Concentrate. First his hands, then his body. This guy gets in bed with me. - The same guy as always. - I'll put it down. Charlie, I'm gonna kill this guy. You got two more weeks, Freddie. Try to put up with it. It's not Sonia. We have to talk. Now. Come. Come on. Why shouyou cooperate with me? Why? You'll work hard, get better, and then what? - Nothing. - You came here from Puerto Rico to do better, and you did. Terrific grades, prizes, and then what? - Nothing! - No? Why did you knock yourself out at school? For who? Not Sonia. - For no one. - For who? For me! Oh, you did it to please yourself. And all the letters that you wrote talking about how great you were doing were for you? - Stop it! - Who was it for?! My father. For him? The one who put his cow in your bed? The one who you said never cared for you? You did it for him? Talk, Freddie. Who was it for? Leave me alone! Excuse me, but this is the only place we could find to work. So if you please, just do your business and leave. No. No. We're working. Let it out. Open your heart and let it all come out, Frederico. Never wanted to come here! I wanted to stay with her. Why'd she send me away? She was sick. I don't care. I wanted to stay with her. Did you tell her so? Yes. No, she should have known! But you were such a good boy, you went quietly. She wanted you to do well, and you did. I killed myself doing good. To bring it all back to her. Sure. Look, Mama, look what I did. For eight years. And in return, what did she do? She died. She died! Yes. She died. Threw you away. Do you think that she planned it, got you to do all that for her and then died on you on purpose? Planned to die? That's so stupid. Nobody plans to die. Really? She didn't dump me. No. She just died. It's so sad. Listen, thank you. I appreciate what you did for me, thank you. Freddie. - It's not over. - What? There is still a lot more work. On what? Why you feel helpless so often, on what you describe as living in a police station where everyone is a cop except you, all this stuff that leads to your rages. I thought this was it. That's why I'm asking you to stay on. - I don't know. - Think about it. Steve? What is it? What's wrong? Frankly, us. Why? What? I keep telling myself it's Freddie, but it's more. It's you. There are certain things we agreed on, the way our life was going to be. Us together, then us and our kids, and then and only then our patients. That got all turned around. No. I love you. Then why does Freddie come first? He doesn't. You said you were gonna back off of this case. You didn't. Instead you started more serious treatment. Nobody asked you to. It wasn't required for your residency. You did it and I went along with it because, quite frankly, when you tell me that a life is at stake, I don't want to be the kind of racist creep that says, "What, Freddie Zamora, a walking ghetto blaster?" And as I say it now, I hate myself. And to add pettiness to my sins, there was another life at stake here, too. Mine. And I ain't getting a fair shake. What do you want me to do? My final shameful request. Drop Freddie. Lisa: Your 30 days are up tomorrow. How do you feel about it? Freddie: Good. Nothing happened. I'm just worried about what to do. I'm scared of going out there. Halfway house, getting a job. All of it. But staying here? Working with you? I don't know. I'm scared of what might come out. Could it be worse than losing yourself in one of your explosions? I don't know. What if it's more than a year? I mean, you're gone. Then what do I do? I won't desert you. ( chuckles softly ) You say that now. No. I mean it. Yeah? Your boyfriend, he's gonna let you? I'll... handle my own action. ( chuckles softly ) ( chuckles ) See, I really taught you something. You have to handle yours. Yeah. Yeah. Why-- why are you doing this for me? Because I'm a doctor and you're my patient. No. Because you are a very important person. I don't know about that. I want you to know that whatever you decide, I will still be here for you. Man: Yeah, sure, I saw that. ( laughs ) You're fast! Here they come, Freddie. It's your big day. You gonna stay with us, kid, or go? Morning, fellas. - Morning, Fred. - Good morning. How you doing? I'm fine. I see it's been 30 days since your last, uh... incident. Tell us, uh, how do you feel about all that? I mean, about your problem. Well, uh, Dr. DaVito and me been working on it, and it's coming along. We still have a long way to go, but... I mean, either here or in outpatient. Uh-huh. Well, uh, tell us, how do you feel about leaving? I've, uh... I've thought a lot about that. Go, Freddie. And, uh-- - Go. - Get out of this place! All right, fellas, please. Let's let Fred speak for himself. Go on about your business now. Dr. Butler, maybe Freddie would like to discuss this over there. Oh, it's a good idea. Come on, Fred. Now, Fred, both Dr. DaVito and I understand that this has to be totally your decision. You're not here to please us, only to do what you think is best for yourself. I, uh... I got to get out of here. I'll leave. I'll be all right. I'll make it. It wasn't a free choice. He felt pressured. - Lisa-- - The fact that the other patients were there-- Lisa, face it. He wants to go. - Let him. - What if I won't? Please, do you want me to give the case to Parley? He'll do it. What if he hurts someone out there? We've never had a patient do that. Now, we all lose patients. He wants out. Let him go. Talk to him, Charlie. He'll listen to you. - Please, it's my last hope. - Lisa, if Freddie wants out, it's not my place to talk him out of it. It is, if you think it's in his best interest. Well, that's just the thing. I do not see this place as being good for anybody. I mean, I know he attacked you, but just being a patient in that zoo would make me crazy enough to do that. What about the breakthrough he had? Doesn't that tell you something? I know that I can help him. - knows it. - Fine, then he'll decide. How, if he barely admits that there's a problem? - It's his right. - To choose the wrong thing? - Yeah. - That's what it's all about. You wanna treat him, he wants to go. The hospital wants him to go because they need his damn bed. - Do you go with that? - That is none of my business. - I am here for his rights. - Even if it kills him? It's getting to you, huh, kiddo? Where's that old professional detachment? I don't know. You know, it's not about being a doctor anymore. It's just about being human. You were right, you know. I came out here to have this wonderful, creative experience and then fly off to the good life with all the rich neurotics. And then along came Freddie. Now I don't know what I want. Harry Handsome? Not good. Come. Charlie? Yeah. Is this confidential? Yeah. What? Everything's falling apart. Now, you have your medication and your refill card? - Yep. - And I'll see you next Tuesday. - You bet. - What time? - 5:30. - Down in outpatient. You got it. So long, Doc. Ooh! Okay. This is it. No booze, no women, no drugs except what you bring from the hospital. Mr. Krouse, that's my husband, he's always checking up. You know what that means, young man. Frederick Zamona? Zamora. Yes. You haven't finished high school. No, but I plan to. What kind of skills do you have? I draw pretty good. I haven't anything for you. I just want a job. I'll put you on the list. Any job. It doesn't have to be good. Excuse me, this is Dr. DaVito from up on four. I'm checking into a patient of mine, Frederick Zamora. He was scheduled for today. Has he called or anything? Uh, thank you. I'm very concerned about Freddie. He's missed two sessions already. Do you have any idea about where he is? ( door opens, closes ) Freddie! Hi. How are you? Fine. Would you like to come have coffee with me? I'm on my way to the cafeteria. I missed you last week. I had appointments. Job appointments. How's it going? Fine. And your medication, you're taking it? Twice a day. Are you sure you don't want to join me? You know, the cafeteria is still serving its morning special, rock-hard Danish. ( chuckles ) - It's a good idea. - Precisely... It's hard to talk here. People push so bad, man. They don't care. All they do is bug you! Freddie, do you want to come back in? Readmit yourself? Listen, I don't take crap. I'm gonna make it! ( people exclaim ) I don't take crap! Freddie? ( indistinct agitated chatter ) It's happening. My God, it's really happening and there's not a damn thing I can do about it. We'll talk to Butler. The kid misses two sessions, shows up, talks violent, and splits. - Maybe Butler will bring him back. - He can't, I've already tried. He'd have to get a court order, which means Freddie would have to do something. - True. - Which is the insane joke of it 'cause that's exactly what Freddie's gonna do. It's like watching a bomb drop. All you can do is watch. Mrs. Krouse, this is Dr. DaVito again. I'm sorry to bother you, but has Fred Zamora come home yet? What? ( sighs ) Mr. Krouse. At work? Where? Well, yeah. Do you know where on Thomas Avenue? Just somewhere down there. All right, uh, thanks. - What are you doing? - I'm going over there. At this time of night? Are you crazy?! You're going to that part of town at this time of night alone, for what? I've got to try and find him. I know where his head is right now, and it's bad. And what are you gonna do about it? I don't know, uh, talk to him, try to calm him down. You realize this is certifiably nuts, don't you? Talk to him about what? Try to do what? I don't know. - Try to do what?! - I don't know! Wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm not gonna let you go. Steve, please, I just-- I have this feeling. If he hurt himself or he hurt someone else-- You wouldn't be able to stop it! Wh-what are you gonna do? Are you gonna be with him? You gonna stay with him every second? Lisa, this is crazy. Maybe, but I at least have to try-- This is the most unprofessional behavior I've ever seen! Look at you, you're running after a patient in the middle of the night! Why? Because it's after office hours? What, do we stop being doctors after 5:00? I'm not gonna go. And if you go, I won't be here when you get back. We could end it right now, Lisa. Or we could go back to what we had before Freddie. Erase him from my mind? Steve, come on. Lisa... look at what you're doing. Look at yourself. You've got this guilty little rich girl syndrome. You're trying to wash yourself clean through Freddie. - Do you really believe that? - Well, look at you. No! No. Listen to you, digging up that old canard. Because it's true! Lisa, y-you've-- you've turned into something else, some kind of true believer. You're trying to cure the world, Lisa. My parents couldn't do it, and neither can you. No, I'm trying to help a boy in trouble, to be a caring doctor. If that's curing the world, then, yes, I am. I guess I have changed. I'm sorry. I... I guess something happened on the way to California. Hey. Hey, you. You're late. You start at midnight, not 10 after. Hey, you hear what I said? Then what do you say? I'm sorry. - What? - I said I'm sorry. Off the streets, you give him a job. He comes in like he's doing you a favor. Excuse me. Um, I'm looking for a young man, name of Freddie Zamora. He is about this tall, dark, curly hair and thin. Come on, look at that stack here. Get a move on! Thank you. Look. Look at this, it's dirty. They sent it back. What the hell are you doing back here, sleeping? It's filthy! Look, I just got here-- Hey, hey, hey, you talking back? I didn't ask you a question. I told you-- filthy! You're gonna pay for this. I'm taking this out of your pay! I want you washing dishes back there, that's what I pay you for! Not to lay around! You hear what I'm talking to you about?! Hey! Hey! I'm talking to you! You hear me?! ( grunts ) ( siren wailing ) They know who did it? Some guy who worked here. Some Spanish kid. Did they get him? You kiddin'? He took off, fast. ( siren whoops ) ( telephone ringing ) ( grunts ) Yeah. Lisa: Charlie, it's happened. What? Freddie killed a man. He ran away after. What should I do? Oh, no. What about Freddie? I'm worried about him. Forget Freddie. You're in trouble. What? Why? You signed his release. You let him out. On Butler's orders. Lisa, wake up. This is way beyond Butler. This is the hospital. You think they're gonna take the fall for this? They're gonna hide, and there you are, so far out on the limb that they can't see you. Harry Handsome too busy to drive you? Yeah. Well, first news-- not good. I can't get a hold of Butler. I tried him four times at home, zip. You think he's ducking? I think he's got a problem. - He's my friend. - Yeah? Enough to put his job on the line for you? Steve's gone. He left me. I'm sorry. We just break in on them? Sometimes you get your best answers that way. Okay, Doctor, my client would like to know exactly what's going on here. She's not your client, Charlie. You work for the state. I quit! You're ducking her. Why?! We're conducting an investigation. Have you investigated yourself? Dr. Butler, you ordered me to release Freddie. No. I urged you to accept the fact that he wanted to go, which you did. - You took responsibility. - You're gonna blame me? I'm gonna try and protect you as much as I can. Short of taking the fall yourself. Now don't be insulting, Charlie! It doesn't help here! I mean, you don't think I feel bad? You don't think I feel responsible? But I'm the ward chief, for God's sake! I represent the hospital! Whose name would be sullied if you took the blame. Whose ability to continue helping patients would be impaired. - You gonna throw her to the dogs? - Like you did Freddie. - He's a police matter now! - He is still my patient. Would you, for God's sakes, get off Freddie? - We're fighting for your job here. - No! Because Freddie and I are the same. We are taking the blame that should go to this hospital, and you know it. You're covering up. If you try it, I'll call a press conference and have her tell her side. Parley, I've got to talk to you. No, you don't. Please, just for a minute. I've nothing to say. Parley, Butler was gonna have you sign Freddie out if I didn't, and then you'd be on the spot. Mnh-mnh, this is your game. You asked for it, you play it out. You know all about this, what they're trying to do to me? Okay, the hell with me. What about Freddie and all the other Freddies that are gonna come through here? Are they gonna get the same rotten deal that he got? Because if someone doesn't put a stop to it, they will. And they're gonna go right back out on the streets again. How many deaths can you handle, Stoddard?! You say you care for these men? Well, do you care for the Freddies, too, or the ones that they'll kill? Now, you know that I wanted to keep him here. All you have to do is say so. Uh, Dr. DaVito, Lisa? I, uh-- What is it? It's... it's your suspension. ( chuckles softly ) Pending an investigation. I'm sorry. I really thought we could do some good. I, uh... I loved your idea. Listen. It made me young again. But, uh... after 20 years in this place, I guess I-- I am this place. I, uh-- I understand. I'm so sorry. ( soft knock on door ) ( knocking continues louder ) I was in the neighborhood, which is lie number one. And I thought we might discuss your case. Lie number two. How about "I wanted to see you"? Oh, the truth. Well... Do you want a drink? Oh, no, thanks. ( sighs ) Some day, huh? Yeah. Did you really quit your job? Yeah. Because of me? You, Freddie, me. It was a good job. I was really doing things with people. Then with Freddie... it turned on me, I don't know how. Suddenly doing the right thing for him had this terrible outcome. And... I don't blame the job or patients' rights or any of that, but... it locked me up. I couldn't see what was really happening. And then this death... I had to get free. I had to do something. For me? So... now what are you gonna do? I don't know. Fight this thing. Then what? Go on to private practice, I guess. You? The way you dress? ( both chuckle ) Do you have any idea where he is? Did he have any money? Credit cards? No, not that I know of. I assume he's still here in the city. And there have been no further... Incidents? No, not that we've heard about. Look, Doctor, I appreciate your concern, but there's really nothing you can do. I've got your number. If we find him, I'll call you, okay? Yeah. ( sighs ) Mr. Za-- Mr. Zamora-- Mr. Zamora had not been violent during his stay here and his psychiatrist felt he could be released. Male reporter: What is that doctor's name? Butler: I can't answer that pending an investigation. Male reporter: Isn't it in fact the second year resident Dr. Lisa DaVito? No comment. Male reporter: Why no comment? Butler: That's all I can say for right now. No, look, I-- I've given you all the information I can. I'm sorry, but that's just about all I can-- I can answer at this time. Female anchor: That was Dr. Butler of Elvira Hospital... ( groans ) Thank you! I served you a full lunch! Soup, coleslaw, club sand, French fries, soda. He's gonna stiff me. What's the matter, don't people tip where you come from? ( anchor continues indistinctly ) Sorry. Freddie. I've been so worried about you. I've been everywhere looking for you. You and everyone else. Are you okay? Yeah. And you? Yeah. It all went bad, huh? Now they're getting you, too. You heard. Yeah. Bad people. Frightened. You were right. I should have stayed. We could have gotten there. I just couldn't wait. I couldn't trust it. Well... maybe it's not too late. I killed a guy. I know. Freddie... I, um... I spoke to the police, a very nice man, Detective Garcia. Now, he said if I called, he would come down and help you turn yourself in. He said he would protect you. It will all be very quiet and very safe for you. You wanna call the cops? Freddie, I have to. Crap! Where's your money? - It won't help you. - It'll get me out of town. Freddie, it's no good! Wherever you go, they'll find you! No, they won't! Freddie, no! ( knock on door ) Freddie, no! Charlie: Lisa, what is it?! What's going on?! ( pounding on door ) ( running footsteps, door opens ) ( dog barking, pounding on door continues ) Where is he? ( dog barking ) Come on. On the Zamora case, he was here. Beck Street. No, no, he's gone, but he can't have gone too far. - ( crying ) - The number? I can't take it anymore. I know. I know, it's over. It's okay. ( sobbing ) It's okay. Well, you do keep mentioning his violence, but there's only one reference to the attack. How come? We put it all down in the record. I didn't think I had to put it down again in my notes. What, not even to cover yourself? Charlie, that was the good old days. I thought like a doctor then, not a lawyer. Still, there's usable stuff here. For what? To defend you in the investigation. No. No, I can't, I... I just don't have anything left. So they win. So what? Maybe Steve was right. Let them have the world. Whatever they make of it, they deserve. Don't turn that moral silence on me now. Come here. It beat me, Charlie. Plain and simple, the system beat me dead. Maybe. Haven't you ever been beaten? Sure, lots of times. What did you do? You go back in. You're a fighter. I'm not. I don't know what I am. It's all right. Rest. ( telephone rings ) Yes? She can't come to the phone right now. What? Yes. I don't know. Who was that? It's Detective Garcia. They got Freddie cornered in a barbershop downtown, La Granger Street. He's taken a hostage. Did Freddie ask for me? No, Garcia did. You don't owe Freddie a damn thing. Would you get my coat, please? You're shaking something fierce. Are you sure about this? Just get me there. ( siren wailing, police radio chatter ) Boy, am I glad you could make it. - How'd you find him? - He was in the bus depot. He was heading out. He spotted us and then he ran. So here we are. He's got the barber, and we got the guns. Look, I'm not wanting to use them, but what if I should have to? I need your help. Can you can talk to him? ( feedback whines ) Uh... Freddie? Can you hear me? It's Dr. DaVito. Are you all right? What do you want? To talk. Can we talk? No. Go away. Fred, I'm not angry. I understand what you're going through. Can I come in there and talk to you? - I can't let you go in there. - He won't talk to me like this. I can't use this thing. Can I come over there? Freddie? Frederico? All right. But not too close. Can I bring Charlie? No. Just you. No, forget it! No. Don't forget it. Now it's me or the guns. And if it's the guns, the barber could get hurt. Can I bring you anything? - Yeah. - What? A tank. Besides that, anything. A jelly doughnut. And coffee. Okay. Are you sure you're up to this? We'll find out. To be perfectly candid, I think you're crazy. But it's your play. I'm with you all the way. All right, here you go. She's coming in, Fred! Good luck. All right? Give it to him. Take out the stuff. Take a bite. Now the coffee. I'm Dr. DaVito. And your name, sir? Cerutti, Dominic. Nice to meet you. Now... Fred, you don't want to hurt Mr. Cerutti, do you? Why don't you let him go? Let him go... and take me. You know that I wanna see you get out of this safe. I'll do anything you say. They're less likely to shoot a woman anyway. Besides, it's a fair trade, one Italian for another? All right, come over here. Close. Turn around. Go. You drink it. He's coming out, the other guy! ( cheers and applause ) This way, this way. - Good? - Mmm. Just think about how many more of those you could have. We walk out to the street, Garcia meets us halfway, you give him the knife, and he and I help you get into the car safe. No, we're walking out there, all right. But we're jumping in one of those cop cars, and you're driving me out of here. - And then what? - We drive. With them behind you, with their guns? The best you get that way is dead. Yeah? And your way I end up back in that zoo, or worse, end up in jail. Dead men can't eat doughnuts. ( laughs ) No. I just don't know. Please, Fred. I'll do everything I can. Charlie, too. And lots of others. We'll find a way. Please stay alive. You're still betting on me, huh? Absolutely. All right. But you're not doing too good with your bets lately. All right, we're coming out! It's all right! Don't do anything! Just let us come out. Turn off those lights! Turn out the light! Get ready. Marksmen, maintain your positions. ( crowd murmuring, radio chatter ) Well, well, well. Look who's here. My keeper. Come on, Freddie, it's just a little bit further. No. I want to say something. You see him? He runs that psycho place down on Broad Street. He lies about her. The hospital wanted to dump me! She was the only one there who wanted to keep me, to treat me! And I want everyone to know that! Because I'm not going back there! - Fire! - Fire! ( crowd screaming ) ( crying ) No... Man: All right, move in, move in. No! Get away from him! Don't touch him! What are we doing? What are we doing? What are we doing?!
