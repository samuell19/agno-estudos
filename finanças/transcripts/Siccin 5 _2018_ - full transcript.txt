We've suffered for Several years with my daughter, Because of your father, mother and you. The curse of your family, made us feel like hell. Lots of people suffer because of your father's magics. He did great sin. Many people got hurts because of his spells, Charms and seals. I saw people get insane, commit suiside. Strangle their babies. He had a conection with evils, by them he make people his victim. He had a pact with them. He set evil spritsloose on innocent people he didn't know. And turn their lives in to hell. In return of money. He would burn the dead and get people to drink the ash. And caused them to commit big sin. Althought, he had a dark heart, And evil mind, He loves your brother very much, More than all of us. When your brother got cancer, Your father made a pact With evil sprits. If they heal your brother, He would give you to them, and sacrifice you. I can't take this decision alone. You have to approve too. I can't cary the burden of this sin alone. We all agreed, to save your brother. Some months later, The doctor told that your brother is recovered. And your father said, we have to fulfill the deal. Or that they haunt us all. Your granpa made deal with us. Your father got better, But they didn't gave your aunt to us. On that night, We drugged you, And prepared you to be sacrificed to the demons. We prepared you for us! The deal was not fulfil, Your mother prevented it. Your father got what he wanted, we didn't. The deal was not fulfil because of your mother. When we were wake up, your father's corpse was on the ground, Your brother was missing. We haven't seen him till today. He was with us. ... Your mother slowly became crazy after that day. She turn insane because she didn't kill you. That's why we took your father. That's why you've never seen your father. They prepare her for us. But your grandma, Didn't kill your aunt. She killed your grandfather. If he had kill your aunt none of this would've happened. My daughter became like this, because of you. We have posessed her body. Now it's time to pay for all of this. It's time to fulfil the deal. God, please protect me and help me. You are sick because your aunt didn't die. Bad things happened because because your aunt didn't die. Kill your aunt and everything will be over. Your father will talk to you if you kill your aunt. Your father will always be with you, if you kill your aunt. You are sick because your aunt didn't die. Worse things will be happen as long as your aunt alives. We made a deal with them. It's not use as long as your aunt didn't die. I love you so much aunt. No one ever seen Zhir after that night. Oh God, fogive my family. Take hale up to your heaven. Protect her from the pain of hell. Forgive her for everything she did. God, show marcy on her tiny heart. Aunt, I love you so much. Never forgot me aunt. Hale, Gulten and Nazile were found dead that night in that room. 6 month later, Azra and Selim got married. And now they live in Mula.
