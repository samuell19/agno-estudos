NETFLIX PRESENTS Someone's gotta talk to those two. - Not gonna be me. - It's too much, right? You may judge, but I have to say, I think their love is beautiful. What is it? - You're such a creep. - What, for accepting them? Handsy old couple. Just going at it right in the street. Like, full-on make-out session. All right, all right, get it out of your systems. Ooh! Okay, guess we'll give you some privacy. - I actually like that. - Yeah, you do? - Hey, don't! - Okay. Say hi to your parents, okay. Well, well, well. I'll do that. - Tell us everything. - Those lovebirds. - Let's get out of here. - Shut up. - Was it good? - You're so annoying. Shut up. Please just eat it. Come on. You just ate it yesterday and you liked it. Leon. Leon, can you... It's just cheese. You love cheese, don't you? No, no, no, it's cheese. Just eat it. Eat the cheese, baby. See, Daddy loves it. He's eating a lot. No, Leon, just please eat it. Mom, please don't leave the TV on. I can't hear myself think. No, Leon, your dinosaurs can wait. Just... We are eating breakfast right now. - Can you play with them later? Okay? - Oh. Look who decided to get up. You get your beauty sleep? For your information, I got up early and worked. Great. How much studying did you get done? - Very funny. - You want your ba-ba? Curious what I'm working on? Okay, only three more. Just three more pieces. Yeah, sure I am. Hey, Jo, can you pick up groceries tonight? I'm gonna be working late again. Uh, yeah, I'll go after class. Can you buy diapers and milk when you go? Don't forget, we switched to plant-based diapers and soymilk. - He needs both. - He really needs both, Ma. - Fine, yes. - Thank you. I don't like soup. - What's this? - So you don't forget like last time. What, am I being punished? I'm just trying to save you a trip. Okay, up you go. - Hey, love you. - Bye. Sixty-five more to go. - Peace out, everybody! - Bye. Gonna eat you up! - Later. - Later, Jan. - Bye. - Janek, your lunch! Janek! Well, look what I found. Don't brake so hard. You want me to vomit? I could switch places with you. Why? That one wasn't my fault. Oh, don't start sulking. I'll get you to school safe and sound. We'll get some coffee in your system. Then you'll have some nice meetings, you'll come home to your family, and your night will be wonderful. Thank you, Professor Positive. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Morning. Hi. Morning. Chow time. Chow time. Chow time. Chow time. Chow time. Chow time. Hubi. "Everybody worships." "The only choice we get is what to worship." - Worship. - Worship. Nick. "If you worship money and things, if they are where you find all meaning in life, then you will never have enough." "Never feel you have enough." - "This is the truth." - Truth. Monkey. "On one level, we all know this stuff already." "As myths, proverbs, cliche... clich..." Clichés. Clichés. Clichés. Clichés? Could you stand up for a moment? Is she really hugging her right now? You look ill. I'll order a taxi for you, okay? I respect that. - Bye. - Bye. - Thank you. - Thank you. Bye. - See ya. - Bye. HEY, JO WHO IS IT? YOU ARE FUCKED Come on in! Think you stirred it well enough? Hmm. Maciek. We need to talk about the pigeon problem. I'm sure I don't know what you mean. Because of you, I have a courtyard full of shit. The custodian cleans it, and he's getting tired of it Sorry, but hasn't it always been full of shit? Well, not anymore. Maciek, this is an order. Stop feeding the pigeons. Immediately. I've always hated the decor in here. You're gonna ruin your eyes. My students are on Facebook so much, they can barely see the board these days. Mm-hmm. I say to them all the time, "You're kids, go play in the grass or something." But they're like junkies. They just can't stop staring at those screens. Sounds like you should stop teaching livestock hygiene and start teaching PE. - Should I? - I don't think so. In the old days, you could just kick back while the kids played with a ball. But there too coddled for that now. Speaking of, I heard you hugged my kid in front of the class. Yes, I did. You doing okay? Yeah, fine. - You sure? - Mm-hmm. You're looking a little unhealthy. How does one look healthy, Maciek? You just need to get plenty of sleep, cut down on your vices, and smile more. Hmm. That easy, huh? Just relax. Are you sensitive to sounds? Yes. Earaches? Yeah. Sometimes. Any recent exposure to the herpes virus? No, not that I'm aware of. Mmm... Do you think it could be MS? Where'd you get that idea? Ah... Doctor Google. We'll do a CAT scan. Mmm. Today's chow time is sponsored by Krysia's Pastry Shop. For a limited time only, you can get their "expresso espresso" special with a chocolate sponge and cream pie. Only ten zlotys, you'd have to be a birdbrain to miss it. - Okay, I'm out. - Later. - See ya. - Bye, Monkey. - Same time next week? - Of course. Listen... Your neighbors have filed a complaint. They say that you've been up here smoking pot. And getting naked. Let's go. - Now watch carefully. Watch. - Yeah? Watch this footwork. Not a single dance lesson in my life. MISTER NYSA Hey, what are you doing there? Hey! No rolling when I'm rolling. What? "No rolling when I'm rolling"? Give me that. Okay, Jo, if you were completely free to do what you wanted with no limits, right now, where would you be? I'd be smoking a blunt, lying in front of a horny teacher from an agricultural tech school. Wow. But what about in another life? My mother has Alzheimer's. My youngest son may not graduate. My eldest can't handle being a father. And my husband is falling apart. They need me and I need all of them. So in a world without them? I would have no one. Can you drink it all, please? Yeah? You just need to finish it and then everyone will be so happy. Can you do that for Daddy? All you gotta do is drink a little bit more, okay? Young man, don't you dare force that bottle on the child. You'll make him sick. - Didn't I just tell you not to? - Calm down. It has soup in it. He'll get an upset tummy. What makes you think that his tummy hurts? Babies cry when they're tired. He could also be teething My intuition tells me these things. Well, can your intuition tell you how to fix the sink? - I don't want it. - How rude! I don't want more ba-ba. What did you do to my boy? Let Grammy hold you. - Hey, honey. Going for a run, be back. - Come on, sweetheart. You're with Grammy. So you've been in here dancing? Well that brat drives us all insane? Just try to help out more, all right? Will you hold it still, please? - Janek! - What? Jesus! Can't you and Adam do this? How about you and Adam do this, and I'll go get a manicure. - You're better at this stuff than me. - Anyone would be. All right, enough. I'll just do it. It wasn't me. No, no. It wasn't me. - Mom, open the door. - It was Witek. Or Adam. Mom, it doesn't matter who did it. Let's just get you into a nice bath, okay? Mama? It wasn't me. Mom. Mama. Why the hell can't they just leave and go to your parents' old place? Because I need that place for tutoring. With Adam... how long was it until he slept through the night? Too long. Blood pressure rising, or is it a heart attack? What if it's something serious? Oh, look at that. I didn't know that weed cured hypochondria. Am I just a joke to you? Of course not. I just don't see why you get to have fun at my expense, but when I do the same, you're so above it all. Hmm? What's this all about? - Who created this work of art? - It was there when we got here. Looks like we're fucked. YOU ARE FUCKED Okay, fun's over. You're all going to be late for class. Let's go. On your way. You're totally fucked, dude. Yeah, you. Look, I understand that whoever did this was making a joke of some kind. But this is no laughing matter. Vandalism is vandalism. We need to find a smart aleck and make an example out of him before other kids start defacing school property as well. I already called the police. What did they say? Well, they say they're sending 13 police cars. And the SWAT team too, apparently. I'll just talk to the custodians and they'll get the graffiti cleaned up. That's not how I would've handled this. Is that right? Well, you're more than welcome to run for headmistress when my term's up, ma'am. - Since when am I "ma'am" to you? - Since now. It's not that big of a deal. Why all this agony over a prankster we aren't even able to catch? Witek, you are double fucked! You're the king of Instagram. It's only been half an hour and you've already got over 300 likes. Hmm. You need a lift? We'll be fine. You sure? Plenty of space. Trust me, it's under control. HEY, JO You look good in this picture. Makes you kinda look badass. This funny to you? Sort of. I mean, nothing bad happened. Nothing except that I became a meme. Wow. They won't even remember it tomorrow. Well, I will. Me too. Same here. But you really shouldn't worry. If you're wondering who wins the prize for Fuck-up of the Month, it's "Mister Nysa" here and his little sash. - The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. - "...the tree." Yeah, yeah, I know. - Was that on the car? - Gotta go, Mom. It's green. It's green. It's just... Just an ad. - Hey, are you feeling all right? - Yeah. - Sure you don't want to switch? - No, really, it's fine. No, it's not. Witek. Get out. Buckle up. YOU WILL PAY FOR YOUR SINS Just a sec. Mom, you don't need to clean the windows. Just leave it. Oh, great. Now there's a draft. Just let her clean them a while. She's not breaking anything. Shall we eat? Sure, I'll go shopping. Witek! Why aren't you watching Mom? She's asleep. Look at that. It's oil. What kind of oil? Mmm. Canola, I think. Poor woman doesn't have long. Easy there. Mommy? What are you doing here? Okay. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. A bucket. Bucket! All right. Let it out. You were supposed to keep him out of trouble, so what is this? I'm not his babysitter. You're an adult and a father. - You need to be more careful. - Come here. Now blow. - Mmm? - Right now. No way. I'm 23 years old. I'm not gonna blow. If you don't blow right this second, I'm going to lose my fucking mind! I am exhausted, and you're out with your stupid brother getting wasted? - We're both just really tired. It's okay... - Can we be normal for once in our lives? - Jesus! - Will you calm down? He has food poisoning. This fucking house is poison! - It's okay, it's okay. - Mmm. Mm-hmm. Good morning. Mmm. Present perfect. Alex. Mmm. This has been water. Has this been water? This hasn't been water. Hasn't this been water? Good. Nick? Future perfect in the past. Mmm. This would have been water. This wouldn't have been water. Headmaster wants you. Well, I'm in the middle of class. It's urgent. Uh, okay. While I'm gone, please write down... past perfect, past perfect continuous, and future continuous. I'll be right back. Joanna. There's someone out there who's trying to hurt us. YOUR WIFE IS DOING ILLEGAL THINGS IN HER MOTHER'S APARTMENT If someone knows you're tutoring without paying taxes, it's not going to be a good look for us when word gets out. Who is it? The police are here early. They said they want to talk to you about the details of the case. Any info you'd like me to pass along for now? Tell them to wait, please. Tomorrow we'll be running drug tests. So be ready. Why didn't you tell me? Do you tell me everything? You... are... fucked. So... You are fucked. Margaret. You are fucked. Alex, are you fucked? I don't know, am I fucked? - Kirby. - You aren't fucked. You aren't fucked. We are fucked. We are fucked. Jan, are you fucked? But we are fucked. We are fucked. Louder! - We are fucked! - Whoo! We are fucked! - Whoo! - We are fuck... I see you kept yourselves busy while I wasn't here. Monkey. I would like to invite you to the front of the class. And please read out loud the answers to the task I gave you. I didn't write anything. Why is that? I... got distracted. Hmm. So what do you think I should do? Go on strike perhaps? What's so funny? Listen, soon you're gonna take your... Finals. We've been through this. Maybe I will, maybe I won't. Okay. Sit down, please. We'll continue. Your chariot awaits you, my lady. We can't. Come on, live a little. You've got until the end of this song to get down here. Hoo. Now, from Thursday to Saturday only, you can get half of bamboo chairs. You kids hear that? So make sure you don't go buying bamboo furniture anywhere else. They'll bamboozle ya. - What? - Sorry. I'm sorry. Ow. What are you doing? You'll wake up the whole house. Look who's waking people now. You got the last word, Jo. You happy? Are you? Because you're free to leave if not. - You'd like that, wouldn't you? - You don't know what I'd like. No idea. Let go, Joanna. You let go. ♪ The nightingale flies by moonlight ♪ ♪ Her apron full of stars so bright ♪ You want a little snake? You want two little snakes? Mr. Leon? - Mm-hmm. - Can you make me a big snake? You got three little ones, let's put them together. Make sure he doesn't swallow them. You have to watch, stop him if he tries to eat one. - He's a toddler. He would choke. - I'm watching, Karina. You're looking at him, but I don't know if you're watching. You seem a little distracted. Oh, I'm distracted? Have a pancake, sweetie. Thank you. Don't want that. Remember, it's not a real pancake, Leon. He knows, you don't have to treat him like an idiot. You're not watching him. He's playing with Plasticine and you took your eyes off him. You can't do that. Children shouldn't be playing with this stuff, especially not on the couch. Why is that? Because it's warm and you're on a duvet. If he presses it into the fabric, it'll get stuck. - Where do you see a duvet? - You're sitting on one right now. We are on a quilt. Well, good for you for knowing so many words. But to me, this is a duvet. And that right there is enough for me to care about my kid pressing that crap into the goddamn fabric. If you want to better vocabulary, you should read more books. You read books about duvets, Jo? Who was that? Quilt factory? Come on, sweetie, let's make the ball bigger. Don't just let him mix it all together like that. Well, he's not eating it, Karina. Let him play. Lollipop! - He should be able to reuse it... - Why do you even care? Reuse it? I bought it for him. Why are you holding it over your grandson's head that you bought him a little bit of Plasticine? That's crazy, Joanna. Do you know how much Plasticine I bought you as a child? - I never lorded it over you... - That's not what I'm doing to him, Mom. - No? You said you bought it. - Because it's a fact. I did do that. Well, why did you say that? - It wasn't to lord it over him. - Take the Plasticine to his room. - Know what? You watch him. - I hope you didn't break the bank. Grammy will buy you more, sweetheart. You're not the only one in this house! Since when do you smoke? Hey, Janek! You're not to smoke, especially not in this house. Are you crazy? Janek! Answer me right now! Hey! Where are you going?

I'm having an affair. I'm sure you know what it'd do to our family of this were to get out. So calling the police is not an option here. That's why I need your help. Why are you getting me involved in all this, Mom? Well, what would you do if you were me? Fucking hell. I don't know. Mom, I think you gotta tell him. I will, someday. But right now, I'm asking you. For what? I need you to find me someone in forensics who can look at the fingerprints on this letter. Witek. Witek. Wake up. Look at this. It's here too. Oh my God. What happened? You know, I think we should all go to a café tonight. Why? The coffee we have at home is great. Bet Karina's gonna scream when she sees you. Oh, shit. It's cool, she's not contagious. - Okay... - We think. Maybe this is a punishment. What kind of punishment? - I want milk. - Biblical. Yeah, that's true, Mom. Any sins you wanna talk about? Come on, guys. We should be positive here. This way Mom gets to do her favorite thing and go see a doctor. That'll be fun, right? Yeah? You doing all right, Joanna? Everything's going to be fine, darling. She's always so anxious about these things. Chow time. Chow time. Chow time, chow time, chow time. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on, my pretties.

My mother's fruit punch recipe is three decades old. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Uh, hi. - Hey. - What's up? - See ya. Oh. Listen, I, uh... I got you this. Uh... It says you can put it on your skin twice a day, so it should help out with everything. Uh, and this is an herbal tea. - Hmm. - Which is supposed to help you relax. I asked my friend to get some advice from this Mongolian guy he goes to. Thanks for your concern, but I have some of the best specialists in the city. What did your friend say, though? That... you worry a lot. And that he'll get you on a treatment plan if you go to his office. Says you'll be cured. Mm-hmm. I love you, Jo. So please stop ignoring me. Don't make a bigger fool out of me than I am already. Expulsion is out of the question. We're not here to destroy students' lives. You have another suggestion? Calm down. Apart from the marijuana, are there any other drugs our students tested positive for? Three students also had mephedrone in their bloodstream. Thank you, Officer. Maciek, I'm sorry, but your daughter is a problem We're going to have to expel all three of them. Or, they can transfer schools quietly once the school year is over. Those are our options, really? This is a bad decision. Why don't we wait for your test results before we hear your thoughts on the matter? I beg your pardon? Did you think we'd never find out about your little pot smoking habit? So tragic. Why the fuck didn't you defend me from her... No, no, no. You don't get to blame me for this. These are serious allegations, Jo. And we both know that they're true. Such a politician, aren't you? Your position's all that matters. Congratulations, Headmaster. "There are these two young fish swimming along." "And they happen to meet an older fish who nods at them and says, 'Morning, boys.' 'How's the water?'" "And the two young fish swim on for a bit." "And then, eventually, one of them looks over to the other, and goes... 'What the hell is water?'" What the hell is with the spanking? Karina and I, we made a bet the year before last. Mm-hmm. I bet her you'd give us the old apartment before the year was over. I owe her 100 spanks. Daddy, I wanna see Mommy. I want Mommy. And where is Karina now? I think she's off with her girlfriends at a lake. What, you don't know? You mean you don't know where the mother of your child is? Does Dad know where you are right now? You're young enough to be my daughter. But I'm not, am I? Adam. Well, fuck. - Oh, fuck! - Let's go! Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck. Shh. Go. Come on. Come on! - Shh. - Jesus Christ. It's a plastic model. This is Maciek's room. Mom, how'd you know where to find his keys? Don't ask stupid questions. Shh. He's gone. Open the window, please. Whatever that is smells horrible. You've been running a lot. Yeah, you've been quite a busy woman yourself as of late. At your sons' expense. My mom's expense too. They'll be expelled. Even Monkey. - You heard the way other teachers talk. - Do you think I give a shit what they say? This is an about your ego, Joanna. - It's about the entire school. - Really? My ego? - You got anything else you wanna say? - Listen, I'm not trying to fight with you. Oh sure, you're not trying to fight. You woke up this morning and told me that I stink. I'm sorry, all right. I'll start the whole day over. Good morning, Joanna, my love. I'm so happy to see you alive and well. And you smell beautiful. Thanks. - Story! - Soup again? Story! I want to read a story! I want to read a story! Please, I am begging you, just give me a minute. Leon, calm down. If you just give us the keys to your parents' apartment, we'll be gone. This will all go away. Well, it's her decision. Why don't you talk to them about why not, Jo? Yeah, Mom. Why not? Let me tell you something. If you think a new apartment will solve the problem behind that wall, then you're fools. Now I'm gonna go calm that little boy down in two minutes so you see what parenting looks like. Could you get some milk? Sure. Would you look at that, just 29 left now. I wanna go play. I wanna go play. See those dark patches? Those are dead brain tissue. And in six months, they're going to double in size. What's your advice? You'll need to settle your mother's affairs. It would be wise to start planning ahead for the coming months. Joanna, you have latent tetany. It's a calcium deficiency, so you might want to drink more milk Hmm. We are currently on the upper floor, which houses patients who are still able to walk. There's an elevator, of course, but if someone wants to use the stairs, that is obviously their choice. We encourage all physical activity. So, if your mother takes walks or does stretches, she can do that here. Right this way. This is the room we've prepared for your mother. It's not a five-star hotel suite, I know. But it's been cleaned, and I guarantee she'll be very happy here. Oh, I'll be happy? Go fuck yourself, you bastard. - I hope you get Covid. - Stop. Mom. Mom, stop. Son of a bitch. I can't believe that you're just gonna leave grandma here. We'll see what you do someday when it's me. No one puts their loved ones away in the country. Oh, "the country"? Well you don't live in the country anymore, do you? - Why do you hate where I'm from? - I don't. It just doesn't make you better than us. Chow time. Chow time. - Chow time. - Freak time. Freak time. Freak time. - Chow time. - When is that dude gonna grow up? He's a teacher. How bad are you? Thank God he hasn't noticed it's us. How can you tell? He would've said something obnoxious. Don't speed, please. It's frightening. - Who's that? - The bank. - Are you gonna it? - I'm driving. Just pick it up, Mom. Joanna, stop the car. She's so self-righteous and stubborn. I like that about her. And about you. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. One sec! Joanna, I know this apartment means a lot to you, but could you please kindly consider giving it to us? Because it's very hard for Adam and I to raise our child and a dog pile. Aren't you direct? You do realize you can always rent a studio apartment, right? No need for all this extra space. You just need to have room for two people. And a dog. Shit. Ow. Don't give me that look. I won't tell Witek. I'm not that stupid. But I bet he knows some thing. It's not hard to see. If your happiness depends on other people's decisions, you will never be happy. That's all I have to say about the matter. Let's go. 'Kay. For fuck's sake! Go. Okay. It's okay. We can't go on like this. Come on. He says the fingerprints on the envelope don't match the ones on the glass. Then maybe we'll have to go in for another sting. Just get some rest, okay? - Or better yet, talk to Dad. - Hmm. Any other terrible advice you want to give me today, or are you done? God, you're ridiculous! You're ridiculous, Mom! You can't just pretend to be grateful? Huh? Did you think for one second about what I'm doing for you? I'm lying to my partner, talking to private investigators, I broke into fucking school! For fuck's sake. Hey, hang in there, Jo. Oh my God, there she is. ENGLISH CLASSROOM - Good morning, Headmaster. - Good morning. Good morning. Żabnicka, I need you to come down to my office with me. You're not going anywhere, Monkey. On what grounds are you pulling her from my class? I'm the headmaster of this school, and everyone here is required to do as I say. If you expel this girl, it will be my last day at this school. We'll talk after class, then. I'm not afraid of him. I'm not afraid of anyone. Pomegranate sounds good right now. I'll buy one for you. Do you happen to recognize anyone in this video? No. I really don't care what you were doing in the school at night. I'm not interested in why you had the keys to Maciek's classroom. But if anyone sees this, I can't defend you. You're going on sabbatical for the rest of the year Maybe you're the one behind all of this. Go home, Joanna. Hello? You will find a link to a video in your inbox. If you do not show it to your family this evening, the whole city will see it tomorrow. Okay, Jo, if you were completely free to do what you wanted with no limits, right now, where would you be? I'd be smoking a blunt, lying in front of a horny teacher from an agricultural tech school. Yes? Hello? Yeah, hi, I'm looking for a man in a sexy sash. Could you please ask him to take his pants off? I'm sorry, you're breaking up. Could you repeat that? I said get up and take off your pants. - Now what? - Well... You took a vow to love me. Honor me. Be faithful to me. I'm not gonna take this. I stood by your side for years. And I listened to your bullshit. But I just can't anymore. The insecurities, the emotional blackmail, I'm tired of them all. And I'm tired of you. Because you're a coward. I'm going for a smoke. I'm done. Yeah, you do that. You go have a smoke and leave me to feel guilty. Just like you've done my whole life. Amazing parenting as always, Mother. You're being so unfair right now. And what do you know about fair? Huh? Is my life fair? Making you breakfast every day? Doing your shopping? Taking care of your child? Doing laundry? Cleaning for you? Oh yeah. But that's not enough, is it? You need an apartment as well. Ya know, Karina, I really don't understand how you can live with a man who's so weak. Oh, look, speaking of the weak. The little prince is laughing. Well isn't that nice? I'm so glad you're enjoying yourself, Jan, because no one else is. I hope to God this wakes you up. You hear me, Janek? Wake up! - Or you'll end up like your father! - Shut up! - Excuse me? - I said shut up. You shut up! 'Cause I wanna thank you guys. What a wonderful life. I wanna thank you all! - Who the hell are you? - I'm asking you that. I am so sick of you people. I'm sick of you, and I'm sick of you, and I'm sick of you as well! Grandma's gone! Grandma! Grandma! Mom, where are you? Mama! Grandma! Grandma! Hey, there, pretty lady! I fucking love you. - You know that? - Fuck are you doing here? Go home. I'll stay somewhere tonight. When you coming home? Don't know. Secret. Honesty. Obligation. Need. Family. You. I love you. - How 'bout here? - Morning. - I want this area clear. - Okay. A lot of foot traffic here... - Good morning. - No, it still looks crooked. - Let's move these chairs. - Lower. - Hey. - Hey. What do you think? - Check... - Looks nice. "TO CATCH A TRAIN GOING ANYWHERE..." I've been telling you from the beginning this slogan's too pretentious for him. You should've made it, "You are fucked." Get right to the point. I just wanted it to be poetic. Today is not just about him. It's about all of us, right? What's up with you? Nothing. You guys have been so doom and gloom lately. What, are you surprised? Men are more emotional than women. It's ingrained in us, you know, Because of the societal pressures. - Catholicism, the patriarchy. - Check, one, two. I've got a slogan. Hmm... Rejection. Good morning. Good morning to you all. Well, everyone, I have an announcement to make now. We will not be expelling anyone. I'm sure that the students who caused this whole mess will make for great custodians around here. We'll need a lot of them to keep things in order. And I will personally make sure they don't get into any trouble over the summer break. Now... I'll see you in the auditorium. And... I'm counting on you to not be late. I wanted to tell all of you that I've handed in my resignation. After today, I won't be a teacher here anymore. I just don't feel that it's the right place for me. Now, I can tell you're distraught that I'm leaving you right before your finals, and I understand that. Life's hard. It just is what it is, and you'll get through it. It's very hard for me to say goodbye to all of you like this. But it's what's best. And I've learned to be hopeful for the future. - I wanted to thank you for teaching me. - We're fucked... Especially one of you. Thank you so much. Thank you. You really are fucked. And a whore. What happens now? I told you, I've decided to resign. You can always un-resign, right? Hey. I think I may have come at a bad time.
