All you do is eat and sleep. I want you to get some education. Here's my library card. Why don't you go down there and take out a few books? It's time you learned how to do something besides eating and sleeping. You two better settle down. The owner of a cat next door just called. He complained about the racket you two were making. He says it's upsetting his cat... ...and for you two to stop this racket. What's this about a magic show, Charlie Brown? Snoopy found a book about magic at the library. -And now he's going to give us a show? -That's right. He's built a stage and everything. It gives me great pleasure to introduce... ...in his first show ever... ...one of the world's great magicians. None other than the Great Houndini. Fake. Fake. That's no rabbit. Fake. Fake. That's no rabbit. We want our money back. Robbery. Robbery. Ha, ha. What a fake act. And now, ladies and gentlemen... ...the Great Houndini will attempt the famous ring trick. Yeah, yeah. lt's a robbery. Now let's see you take them apart. Fake. Fake. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fake, fake, fake. The Great Houndini will now attempt the great stick-in-the-hole trick. We need a volunteer from the audience. Me, me. l wanna volunteer. Please step up to the stage. The box, please. Please note: When the Great Houndini plunges the stick through the hole... ...it penetrates completely through the box. Now I will ask the volunteer to step into the box. Quiet, everybody... ...while the Great Houndini performs that fantastic trick. Ow! Attention, attention. We will need another fearless volunteer. Boy, not me. I think I fit the description. I'll go up there and help my good friend Snoopy. Very good, my friend. If you will just step into the magic closet... ...we will amaze the audience. Watch carefully, please. Oh, wow. Hey, hey. Get me out of this. Oh! Ooh! Ah! Hey, get me out. Hey, get me out. Hey. Help. Help. And now, for your amazement... ...the Great Houndini will give a display of telepathy. Our assistant will go into the audience... ...and select personal objects. The Great Houndini will try to name each and every object. The Great Houndini says that the object is a very pretty beanie. And now, great magician, what is the young lady holding? The Great Houndini says... ...that the object being held is a watch on a chain. Oh! Wow. How's he do that? Now for the next trick... ...we need the cooperation of the audience. We need another volunteer to lend us a piece of clothing. -Here, we'll give this to the magician. -No! Give it back, give it back. Don't worry, sweetie. It won't hurt your blanket. MARClE: The Great Houndini will cut up this blanket into many pieces... ...and then, before your very eyes, he will make it all come back together. Quiet. Quiet, while the Great Houndini readies himself. I wonder what this trick is going to be. We would like another volunteer for the great levitation trick. Wow. MARClE: Before your very eyes... ...the Great Houndini will raise a person into the air. Boy, l'd like to try that. Great. We have a volunteer. Please come up, madam. Just lie here on that table. Does he know what he's doing? He must have absolute quiet. The Great Houndini demands absolute quiet. I hope he knows what he's doing. Oh. Wow. MARClE: And now, for the best trick of all. The Great Houndini will now perform the great disappearing act. This calls for another volunteer from the audience. Boy, l volunteered once. Maybe you should go this time, Charlie Brown. Me? Yes. The gentleman who just said "me." Please come forward. -Me? -Yes, yes. The gentleman with the large, round head. Please come right up. Let me introduce you to the Great Houndini. Blanket, please. AUDlENCE: Wow! Oh! Good grief. Rain. CHARLlE: It's raining. Where did everybody go? What about me? -l hear breathing. CHARLlE: lt's me. Yipe! Who's me? Me, your brother. My dog made me invisible. No one can see me, even when I'm here. Go like this: Stomp your feet up and down. -Say, "Rats." -Rats. -Say, "I can't stand it." -l can't stand it. It's you, all right. There's no place in this world for someone who's invisible. I'm doomed to walk the earth as a lost soul. If you're a lost soul, big brother, can l have your room? CHARLlE: l guess before I roam the world as a lost soul, I should feed my dog. CHARLlE: Good grief. Hey, Snoopy. Supper time. See what you did to me? You and your stupid magic show. You made me invisible. I can't see my own fingers. I don't even know where my own feet are. You're the magician. Make me visible again. Bring me back. A lot of good that did. I'm still invisible and now l'm all wet. Now what are you doing? I feel like a chocolate chip cookie. I'll say it again: Now what are you doing? Linus, have you seen Charlie Brown? Nobody's seen him since Snoopy's magic show. I just talked to Sally. She said, even when you look at him, you don't see him. What's that supposed to mean? That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. CHARLlE: This is ridiculous. I can't walk downstairs because l can't see my feet. Snoopy will just have to make me visible again. Snoopy? Snoopy. Snoopy! Now, where can Snoopy be? Where is that dog? I just have to find Snoopy. I can't go on like this. What's that? Hey! CHARLlE: What's the matter? Did you lose something? Is this yours? All right, beagle. Here's your magic book. You made Charlie Brown disappear. You better make him reappear. Now, you start figuring out how to make him visible again... ...or l'll pound you. Phew. CHARLlE: Boy, I hope she's setting up the football again. I would sure like to kick it again. If that Charlie Brown is still sneaking around invisible... ...l'll have to be careful. I'm not gonna tee up the ball. But if he is visible... ...l would hate to deprive him of the opportunity... ...to attempt one of his famous place kicks. I think maybe l'll practice a few tees. There. That's about right. Welcome home, Charlie Brown. I did it. l finally kicked that football. Oh no, you didn't. l just pulled it away. I did it when I was invisible. I did it. You can't prove it, Charlie Brown. No one will believe you. Snoopy knows l did it. He made it possible. Why, that stupid dog of yours couldn't disappear himself out of a paper bag. Hey, what are you doing? Put me down. Put me down! Hey. Hey! You can't leave me up here. Hey! Hey, what about me? Hey, hey, what about me?
