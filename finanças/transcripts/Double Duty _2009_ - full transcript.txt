[gunshots] [grunting] [adventurous music] - T1J. - Roger that, Stogy. Hold it right there! Hold it there! There's no moving! - Please, no! No, no, she's deaf. Please, she cannot understand. Please, she cannot hear. [mumbles] - Relax, Major. I have your papers in hand. I was hoping you might reconsider. - The Corps's been very good to me, sir, but it's time I lead a civilian life. - What's in it for you? You're a Marine. - Yes sir, but somewhere deep down inside, sir, I'm a woman, a woman with needs. - What needs? - A man. - This is the Marines, we have a few good men. - A family, sir. - We are your family. - A home, sir. - This is your home. - Sorry general, I'm just tired of getting stabbed and shot at. - You were always a good man, I mean woman, I mean Marine. Goddamn politically correct bullshit. - I know what you mean, sir. - The minute you take these papers- - Always a Marine, sir. - You can take the girl out of the Corps. - Something in your eye, General? - Getting a bit emotional, actually. I remember when you first came to us, little orphan fresh out of college, ready to take names and kick ass. It was some kinda picture. - We've come a long way, General. And it has been an honor. - For me as well, Major. For me as well.

You do not understand, it is not possible. - Then make it possible, Ahmed. - Hey hey hey, hold on there, Gigantor. The little man said that it wasn't possible. Now, why don't you quit trying to fit a square peg through a round hole and see why it isn't possible. - Who the hell are you? - I am your conscience. You wouldn't wanna do anything you'd regret later, would we? This is a Costco card, genius. Listen, why don't you go inside, and I'll be filling up on pump four, okay? - Yeah, a million times to you. - So, since you're getting it for free, why don't you pay for my gas? I said, why don't you pay for my gas? - Do you seriously want me to answer you? - Come on, put the nozzle in my tank. - You want me to shove this up your ass? - It wasn't a metaphor, boys. - These your guys? - Dagger, Shiv, call me Dirk. - Dirk, Dagger, and Shiv. That sounds like a law firm to me. - Boys, this [laughs] lady is gonna be giving us some gas. - You want gas, I suggest you eat a burrito. - Funny. She's a funny Army lady. - GI Jane, that's who she is, GI Jane. - Hey listen, I know where this is going. You guys try and rough me up. [laughs] - Are you making fun of us? - Do I really have to? - You really think the Marines are gonna get here in the nick of time? - They're already here. - Saw that. Didn't see that. [grunting and shouting] [moaning] All right. Let's never speak of this again.

Hi, may I help you? - Yeah, I'm Mimi Lagos. Is Sophia here? - Yes, I know all about you, you are Mimi Lagos. Though you prefer to be called MJ, right? You went to college with Sophia, and then you went straight into the Marines after graduation, periodically keeping in touch of course, and after 20 years of active duty, you've come home to get re-acclimated into civilian life. - Yeah, aren't you cute. - Though there is nothing that indicated in your file that you were a lesbian. I think I should tell you that I'm straight. I'm not totally discounting it from the realm of possibility in some future sexual encounter, it's just who I am. - And who might that be? - I'm Lilly. I'm Lilly, Sophia's assistant. I'm Lilly, Soph... Yeah. - Okay, Lilly. For you information, I am not a lesbian. Can I come in now? - Yes, yes. Please do, come inside. I'm telling you, Sophia is so excited that you're gonna be here for the charity auction this Saturday. Okay. [laughs] - [Camerawoman] Eyes here. Back her up, back her up. - Good girl, she's doing great. Don't mind the photo shoot, it's just that, you know, we're trying to meet a deadline. Is this all your luggage? - Yeah. - Is it hard to find shoes that match that bag? [laughs] - I'm wearing 'em. - Oh. I was trying to be whimsical. - Yeah, me too. - I should go find Sophia. You can follow me, come on. - Wow. - Ladies, ladies- - That's it. - Uh-huh. Look Carl, look, I'm telling you for the last time, I'm counting on you, okay? Oh my god, oh my god, Carl, I've gotta go. Yes, yes, you're doing a good job. Asshole. MJ. - Gosh, you look terrific. - None the worse for wear. Lilly, this is my oldest friend, Mimi Lagos. - [Mimi] Yeah, she knows. [laughs] - Of course you do. [phone rings] I'm sorry, one second. Hello? Carl, listen to me. What? But all you had to do was talk to Lucen's. What do you mean the situation changed, what changed? It was a done deal, right? Get out of here. We'll need you around here. - Thank you so much for having me. - When'd you finally get out? Yeah yeah, I'm here. What, no. You lose this for me, and I'll have your ass. And the hole that goes with it. - Whoa, descension in ranks? - One in every office. How did you handle it in the field? - I figure when all else fails, friendly fire. - Hardcore. - Marine Corps. Not that I didn't want to on occasion, if you know what I mean. - Not really. You haven't changed a bit. Come on, come on. [laughs] you're so silly. - Here are the RSVPs that you asked me for, and this is the menu for Mr. Robert. - Did I come at a bad time? - No no no no no, not at all. I've got a charity auction here on Saturday. Auctioning off a Faberge egg, worth millions. - Millions? - I've also got this photo shoot, which is driving me crazy. Great, I think we'll go with that one. Thanks Lilly. - Of course. - Oh, and do you know where Craig is? - Yeah, he's outside measuring the buffet table again. - Again? - Again. - Can you ask him to come in here, please? - Gladly. - Thanks. Craig's a really good friend of mine, and my caterer. He has really good taste for a single man. - Did you say that for my benefit? - I did. - Which part, the single man or the great taste? - Which would you be least offended by? - Let me see, great taste, single man... Probably the great taste. [laughing] - Oh, Craig Craig Craig, I want you to meet Mimi Lagos. - Hi. - You're Mr. Robert. - Robert is just the name on the business card, and it's my middle name. You can call me Craig, okay? - Call me MJ. - Okay, MJ. When Sophia said she was expecting a Marine, I just thought for sure I was meeting- - Norman Powell. - Oh no no no no, Sergeant Carter at the very least. - Either way, you were expecting a man, weren't you? - Well, when she said MJ, MJ, you could go either way. - Craig. - What? - Why aren't you back here measuring the art? - I'm measuring another table. - For what? - An ice sculpture. - Of what? - You. Don't worry about it okay, you'll love it. - Why do I bother to ask? Be nice. - I'm trying, I can be. MJ, I knew you were a woman, I just... - So that whole crack about Sergeant Carter, that was a joke? - Well, I have a... Great to see you, no, maybe? - Hmm. - Hmm. - So, how long have you been gay? - Who said I was gay? - Does anybody have to? - Ask Sophia. Look, I'm a lot of things, ma'am, but gay isn't one of them, and ask... Sophi... Sophia knows for sure. - Do you like that? Do you like that out there? - Of course I like it, I did it. I put in all the flowers and the plants, and I'm gonna put a koi pond. What's not to like, it's lovely. - Whew, I heard about you. - Oh yeah? Oh, oh no. You did, what'd you hear? - You cook, you clean, and just look at the way you're dressed. - What's wrong with the way I'm dressed? What's wrong? - Look, you have style and taste. - Style and taste doesn't mean you're gay, okay? Please, please I'm begging you, get off the table. It's not a chair. - Ooh, okay. - Thank you. I need to... Like I said, style and taste doesn't mean you're gay. Oh goodness. - And you said you could take a joke, couldn't you? - Well not about being gay, cause I'm not gay. Being gay is- - [Mimi] You can't take a joke. - Excuse me, you two. I couldn't help but take the liberty of compiling a dossier on each of you, because I know that in business as well as speed dating, it helps you. Kinda breaks that ice and gets you talking. So, here you go. Come on. Have fun. Break the ice, break. - Okay, this is good stuff. - I get it. Ooh, it's cold. [cheerful music] - Hey Sophia. - Hi. - Can I get you another drink? - I think I could go for another, MJ? - Yeah, yeah. - Two, please, gracias. - And one para ti, Sophia. I'll make them how you like it. - Gracias. - You speak Spanish now? - I live in California, I sort of have to. I can't believe you're here. - Yeah, well frankly I had nowhere else to go. You're my only friend. My only family, really. And in your last letter you said that you were getting a divorce and I should come stay with you. - That letter was almost three years ago. - It was? - Mm-hmm. - Oh. And you couldn't even get along with that idiot you married. What was his name? - Ray. - Ray, you call him Ray, I call him chicken shit. - Twas the beast that killed the beauty. And by the beast I mean the foundation. The beauty is me. - He cheated on you. - Some say I work too much, he got his affection elsewhere. I don't hate him. Sometimes I miss him. - I want what you had. I wanna be like you. - What, divorced? - No, not like you divorced, but like you. Just look at you. I want that. If I looked like you, maybe I could get a man. Second in command, small little platoon round the house. I would like that. - You're getting a bit long in the tooth to be starting a family, aren't you? - Yeah. What do you say, I'm not old. - How old are you? - How old are you? - I asked you first. Well, we went to college together, so I'd say we'd be right around the same age. - So, how old are you? - 35. [laughing] 38. - Spare me. - Okay, just near 40. - How near? [laughing] - Sloping over the edge. - I knew it, I knew it, you're older than me. - You're lying to me. - Yes. [laughing] You are in great shape for a woman our age. - Yes I am, yes we are. Hit me, really. - Don't be silly. - No no, check this out, hit me. - I get your point. - Give me your best shot, right here, come on. - Sit down Rambo, we know you have abs of steel. - [Mimi] Come on come on come on. - I'll hit you. - What? - I'll hit you. - What did I hear her say? - I'll hit you. - Whoa, hey lady, you drunk? - What's the big idea? - No, I'm not drunk. Why don't you guys get out of here? - I'm telling my mom. - I'm telling my mom. - Yeah, I'll hit you. You want somebody to hit you, I'll do it. - No. I don't even know you. - You only let people you know hit you? - I don't let anybody hit me. - You were just gonna let her hit you. - I'm her best friend. - Yeah, and I just wanted to show her what great shape I'm in. - All right, show me. - I don't want any trouble, okay? - Listen, I'm drunk, and with you two honeys here, I'm never gonna get laid. [laughing] - She paid you a compliment. - Hey, thank you. You think the reason you're not gonna get laid tonight is because we're here? - Yeah, I mean traditionally I do quite well here. - Hey, any of you men, who would like to have sex with, what's your name? - Bertha. - With Bertha, anybody? What, what, what? - Hey, you know, this isn't my usual night. - Okay, why don't you just go home and sleep it off, Bertha? - You know what, I don't wanna go home. I wanna take my frustrations out on you. - This is not a fair fight, Bertha. - Yeah yeah, I know I'm bigger than you, get over it. - Come on, baby. - Well, don't let my two years in the Army Reserve scare you. - That's it. Come here, big girl. [yelling] Oh Bertha, are you okay? Oh dear, oh geez. Oh, my Bertha, you'd better go home now. I think you pissed your pants. - Yeah, well I think maybe you're right. - You're gonna need some help if you're gonna approach men. - You think? Let's get drunk. Where's that Gerardo of yours? - Hold on a second there, miss. If you really do wanna be more like me, it's gonna take some work. You game? - I'm in. - Right, we'll start tomorrow. - [Both] The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain. - Again. - [Both] The rain in Spain stays mainly... [rhythmic music] - I didn't hear anything, I was worried. - I'm exhausted. - Hey, what did you do to her? - What did I do to her? - Yes. - I'm sorry, but she put me through hell. - You through hell? - Yeah. - All I was trying to do was get you to sit and walk like a lady. Craig, come here. Put this book on your head and walk across the room. - Oh sure. Ready. - Mm-hmm. [laughing] - He dropped it too. - At least he got across the room. You couldn't even balance the book on your head. - Sophia, I don't walk, I march. - Well, you're not in the service now, sweetheart. - Craig, a drink, now. Please. - I'm trying as hard as I can, Sophia. - Are you? - It's not easy trying to train an old dog new tricks. - Really? - Hey, you're not giving up on me, are you? - Yes. - Never. - No. Craig. - Yes? - Leave us for a bit, come back in a couple of hours. - Okay, are you gonna be all right? - Yes, we'll be fine. - I'm not gonna be okay. - More Alka-Seltzer. - What do you need? Sure. What do you need? - What do I need? - You need so many things, why bother, right? - Okay. Again. - [Both] The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain. - Oh my god, Sophie, are you dead? - Yes, I am. Pay your respects and leave. Come on now. Oh, I forgot myself. How is she doing? - It's pretty rough going, but I think we made some progress. - Where is the animal, I mean woman? Let's go. - I see you over there. How are you, what's going on? - What are you doing? - I figured since you passed out, I'd grab me some chow, and I found this can of rations in the back of your cupboard. It's good. - You have military food here? Oh my god. - No. Let me have that. That's an old can of ravioli. - You have kids? Oh my god. - I've been to places where people would kill to eat this good. - Really, you have? - Yeah, I've eaten worse. - La la la la la la. - We need to get you a job. - Time to call Annabelle. Annabelle, Annabelle, hey, how are you? - Oh, hello and welcome. Good to see you, Craig. - Good to see you too. - So, this is MJ. - Annabelle, this is Marine Major Annabelle Lagos, retired. - MJ, just initials, no real name? - Sorry ma'am. Been in the Corps a long time, ma'am. The name is Mimi, ma'am. - Mimi, that's better. First of all, never call me ma'am. My name is Annabelle, just Annabelle, the Annabelle. So, good to meet you, Mimi. Sorry ma'am, won't happen again, ma'am. Mimi, could you wait for us indoors? The door is open. - Yes ma'am. - Did this one get wounded in the head? - No. - Maybe there's something wrong with her ears. - That's it, speak up. - Let me take a look at you. Take off her jacket, please. Nice breasts. Lovely figure. Turn around. Great butt. Posture is a little stiff, but good breeding stock. All in all, what is the problem? - I need to find a job, ma'am, a job where I could use my skills and be a woman at the same time, ma'am. - What did I tell you? What did I tell her about calling me ma'am? Could you excuse us for a moment, please Craig? - I'm sorry, of course. - Thank you, dear. If you say that again, I will not help you, and I place clients such as yourself to bodyguard high profile people. Do you want me to help you or not? - Yes, m... - Good. Give me your hand please, miss Mimi. Now, I want you to walk nicely across the floor. And back, please. I want you to walk like a lady, and you march like a soldier. - Marine, ma'am, I march like a Marine. - Either way, you march. - That seems to be my problem, ma'am. - Are you a good Marine, Major? - Oh ma'am, yes ma'am. - About face. And as a good Marine, do you follow orders? - Ma'am, yes ma'am. - Then I order you to stop calling me ma'am! I can't work this way. Craig, Craig please bring me some tea, the chamomile. Now you're being ridiculous. - What, this is for chow, right? What? - You would never get into a chair like that if you were wearing a dress. - Craig, can you tell... I'm not wearing a dress. - True. - True. - Craig. - Yes? - Get our queen for the day a dress. - Yes indeed, I will. - Look, I'm sorry, I know you're trying. What can I say, I know it, I'm sorry. - Don't mention it, dear. - I don't know Craig, I think it'd be easier to turn you into a lady. - I don't think so. I've seen you work with worse. - Do you like it in here? - Oh stop, not now. - [Annabelle] Be a challenge, but I think I found someone that she can work with. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - [Craig] Who might that be? - That might be Jessica Love Simpson. - Jessica Love Simpson, does she need a bodyguard? - Yes, they called yesterday, and she's looking for someone who could look like her girlfriend and be her bodyguard, and I know Mimi can handle it with her background. But what I don't know is whether she can be part of a Jessica Love Simpson crowd. - I know. Let's try this dress on her and see what it looks like. - Thank you. - Maybe it's magic. She's not the most feminine thing I've ever met, is she? May I pour you some tea? - Yes please. - Sure. There you go. And one lump? Two, perhaps. - Three? - Wow, we'll go with it. There you go. - Milk? - Um, no thank you? - Good. - Very good, miss Mimi. - Cookie? - No, no. Miss Mimi, miss Mimi. What do you think your spoon is for? - I figured we were all friends here, right? - What if that tea was hot? Could you discontinue, just discontinue. - It was hot. [coughs] It was hot. - You could burn yourself. - I'm just trained to distract myself from pain. - What? How do you do that? - By jabbing my thigh with a fork. [screams] - Craig, if she has any grace at all, this is when we're going to find it out. - Right, now have you seen her walk? - Yes. Into every life a little rain must fall. - Why mine? - Mimi, come here. The dance, hold your hands here. Craig, on her waist. - Yes yes yes. - On his shoulder. When a woman dances with a man, he sweeps her off her feet to dance in the moonlight, on a cloud of romance. - Really? - Well, it's what she says. I think so too. - Commencer. - It means dance. - Oh. - Head up, head up Mimi, head up. - No, you don't wanna hit my- - Stop, stop, stop, stop. - That wasn't bad, actually. - Mimi, this is not hand to hand combat. Okay Mimi, you are to let him guide you. You are going to trust him. Let's march. Mimi. Left right left right, left right left. Follow me. Left right left right, left right left. Left right left right, left right left. Now backwards. Left right left right, left right left. Left right left right, left right left. Left right left right, left right left. - There you go, there you go. - Beautiful. I knew there was something going on here. - I think this lady thing is just a load of crap. But you know, that's really nice of Annabelle to get me a job so fast. Craig, am I really so bad the way I am? - I don't think so. - Maybe I just don't have what it takes. - Trust me when I say you have what it takes, you just don't display it well as a lady. - You think? - You can get any man you want, by force or otherwise. - You're so sweet. - Did anyone ever ask you what kind of man it is that you want? - The light doesn't get any greener, you horse's ass. - Well, let's see. He'd probably have to be intelligent, and even tempered for sure. - Someone who complements your easygoing personality. - Exactly, yeah. - What do you think a man wants, for instance? - A good woman. - You are a good woman. - You're damn right I am. I'm trained to kill in 10 different forms of martial arts, specialist in large and small arm weaponry. Certification to transport, distribute, and detonate all sorts of explosive devices. - Which means- - Which means I can blow your ass up. - Which means most men are probably scared of you. - Only the men that know me. - [Craig] I know you, and I'm not afraid. - Oh no? - [Craig] Not totally. Actually, I'm slightly aroused. - Well, hmm. Does the fact that I can kill you make you tingle, Craig? - Wow. No, I mean, yes, I mean no. The fact that you can protect me. I never felt so safe, really. Drive faster. - I like that. - Carl, I need those files on the appropriations forecast, the Unicorps contribution. - Working on it even as we speak. - You know, I gave you this account on good faith. Is there something you want to tell me? - No, everything's going well. - Why don't I have confidence in you? - I don't know, why? - Why. Because you assert yourself for all the wrong reasons. You're all for you, and you forget this is a charitable organization. Don't underestimate your importance to this foundation. You have a job to do, now do it. - Hoping that my name went into your refrigerator. - MJ. We are going to Irma Schnotsgower's with cocktails. - Schnotsgower, that's very funny, Sophia. - Yes, Schnotsgower. [laughs] She's on the foundation's board of directors. It'd be good for you to go. Jessica Love Simpson will be there, she's dying to meet her new bodyguard. - Cocktail party, Sophia? - Think of it as a military function, without the military. - Okay. Wait, is Craig gonna be there? - Yes. - Good, I like that. Good, fine. - We'll meet him there. - Okay. - Now I want you to just, you know, try a few things on. - No way. - Just think outside the box, MJ. - No, that is not me. - Try a few things on. It's better on- - I can't do this. No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I can't do this. - Yes you can. Please, MJ. - For you. All right, I'll try. - Excellent. - Get out of here, let me see what I can do. Don't expect much, okay? Only doing it for you, Sophia! You'll be proud of me, Sophia. ♪ Hi, we're your weather girls ♪ And have we got news for you - I like this one. ♪ Get ready, all you lonely girls ♪ ♪ And leave those umbrellas at home, all right ♪ - I'm coming, Sophia.

Look, let me help you. - You always help. - We'll get you all fixed up, okay? - Okay, sorry. - Don't be sorry. - We went down to Palm Springs, a bunch of us, and we were at the Springs Park, and I saw this magnificent man, and I had to have him. - Have him? - Here. - Well, you know, I don't myself believe in this hypnosis stuff. - No, he's great. - Really? - Watch, watch. - You will no longer be gargoyles, but in fact, back in your own bodies, quite safe. Deep sleep. One, two, three. Ladies and gentlemen, Karen and Peter. Give them a big hand. - [Annabelle] See? - What you have witnessed here tonight is not a magic trick, but in fact an example of the power of the mind, the power inside every single one of you. If any of you are here with anyone who has fallen under the spell, then Irma here has very kindly provided me with a private room where I can revive them from that subconscious state, leaving them refreshed and quite safe. - What happened? - Her name is Mimi. She just likes to be called MJ. - Okay, is there any suggestion you'd like me to leave with her? - Like what? - Bad habits. Does she want to quit smoking, stop biting her nails? - I don't know, Sophia? - Could you make her behave more like a lady? - Bingo. - We've tried to teach her, but she doesn't think it's in her. - Tomboy? - Marine. - Corps. - Oh, I understand. Very well. MJ, you are in a deep, restful sleep and hear nothing but my voice. When I snap my fingers, you'll become the very essence of femininity. All the efforts of your friends to make you walk, talk and act like a lady will come to you now. Remember MJ, when I snap my fingers, you'll become the lady miss Mimi. Deep sleep. One, two. - He can count. - Three. Well hello, miss Mimi. - Hello. I don't think we've been properly introduced. - Forgive me, I am Faison, at your service. - Hello, Faison, it's nice to make your acquaintance. - May I present- - Sophia. - Um... - Craig. - Craig. - It's very nice to meet you both. - Sophia is the person you're staying with whilst you're here. - Thank you very much, I hope it's not too much trouble. - No trouble at all. - Sorry. - Oh my. My, I do look a fright. - No you don't, he does, he does. - If you would excuse me. - Absolutely. - You're kidding me, you have a compact? - That was amazing. - Thank you. I believe we discussed a hefty tip. - Do not stop in front of oncoming traffic, tip one. Tip two, don't carry a compact with you. - Sophia, I was looking for you. - Where have you been? You know, running late. Gotta keep the boss happy. - Sophia, is this a friend of yours? - Not exactly, he works for me. - Aren't you gonna introduce us? - Mimi, may I present Carl Meyers, a coworker of mine. - Somebody call heaven and tell them they're missing an angel. [laughing] You're Sophia's friend from the Marines, right? The Marines? Mr. Meyers. - Carl, please. The Marines are for big, tough, strong men like you. - Oh, well. [laughs] I've got someplace to be, but I can stick around for a drink. - Okay. - Carl, don't you have to be preparing for the auction? - Everything's taken care of, Sophia. - Carl is so reassuring. I would care to join you. I'd be so delighted. - We really should be going. - Mimi, would you care to join me? - Wow. - Yeah, come on. - Make me a cosmo, please. Oh, Sophia, how is your friend doing? - Well, she had a nasty blow to the head, but I think she's okay. - How are you feeling? - Mimi? - Mimi. - Annabelle's asking how you feel. - Oh, I just feel fine, thank you. Thank you for your concern. - Well, you look terrific. - I agree. - Same girl? - Yes it is. [snaps] - Oh Jesus, what is going on here? Something is not right, and what's the deal with my hair? - Well, it was up, and then you fell down. - I fell down? - On the floor. - Well, who slipped me a Mickey? What, they use roofies? And who the hell are you? - I'm Carl. Sophia's friend. - I know who you are. You're the puke. Craig, what is going on? - I don't know, I mean I usually do, but now I don't. - Are you kidding me, jeez. [snaps] - Carl, Carl, you left me for a minute. Please don't do that again. - I like this one better. - Too bad. [snaps] - Craig. What is going on here? - Gentleman there next to you is attacking you, I believe. - He's attacking me? - Yes, he is, I think so. - Why yes, yes I am. [shouting] - Thanks, you just saved my things from being shattered. Who did you say you were again? - She is the new bodyguard you ordered from Annabelle. - No way, you're the Marine? - This is my dearest friend, Mimi, aka MJ. - Good to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - You found it. - Whoa. Hey, it's Carl, Carl. - What the hell happened to you? - What? Oh, an incident at the cocktail party, a misunderstanding. - Looks like they misunderstood the shit out of you. - Yeah, you mind? - Boys. - Vinny said you guys were good. - We're out of Vegas. - What's that got to do with anything? Never mind. Look, I'm spending a lot of money here. Vinny said you were doing me a favor. - He said the same thing to us. - I don't even know who you guys are. - Dirk, Dagger, Shiv. - Shiv. That sounds like something you do at a bris. Okay, let's just go over the plan again. All right, the event starts at 10:00. Everybody's gonna be gathered out back. - We come in from the front from three directions. - Dirk on the right, Dagger on the left. - And Shiv through the house flushing out anyone inside. - Then you gather us all up, you handcuff us, you take me hostage. - Hold up, hold up, hold up. We get to loot, right? I know you paying us and all, but all that hassle and- - Did he just say loot? - It's a fair question. - You can have all the Rolexes and fat wallets you can stand, but the egg is mine. Once you get the loot, you take me hostage, we beat it down to Mexico as fast as we can. - There's the little matter of money. - Right. Let's see. - So, we get the other half once we get you down to Mexico, right? - Right. - What do we need you for? - Why don't you guys go out, have a good time on me, okay? Shiv. [laughs] I'll, I'll be in touch. Never mind, never mind. - Watch out for snakes. - Nobody told me there was snakes in there. Okay. Damn it, ow, god. - I think we should tell her. - Tell her what? Hey MJ, you're not enough of a woman to get a man, so we hypnotized you. - Yeah, something like that. - Okay. Go ahead, tell her. - You tell her. - No, you tell her. - I'm not sure I like the other MJ, really. - I say, put her to the test. - I like that idea, I love that idea. And there's something I'm just dying to do myself, too. - I wanna take miss Mimi to the cabana. What do you wanna do? - What do I wanna do? I really can't tell you, you wouldn't like me anymore. - Who says I like you? - Oh come on, you love me, how could you not? Hey, MJ. Would you come here? - Is this a game? Yeah, okay. What's up? - Would you come over here to me? When I say go, okay lady? Please listen, when I say go, I want you to- - Okay, whatever. - Listen and learn. When I say go, I want you to walk from there, over here to me. - All right then. [snaps] Oh my. Yes, hello, Craig, it's so hot in here. - Hi, Mimi. Would you walk to me. - I would, but don't you think it's a little silly request when you could come over to me? I would think so. [snaps] - Go. [snaps] - Hey. - Hey. - Hi. - No, I want you to have a good time tonight, okay. - Thanks. - See you guys tomorrow, okay? - All right, Craig. - Good evening. - What is with this guy, I'm serious. - Bye Craig. - Bye bye. - See ya. - So, what's happening tonight? - A night to remember. [snaps] - That was so delicious, Sophia. - Ladies, can I get you guys anything else? - Oh, how about some tequila? - Tequila, all right. - Have you ever had tequila? - I don't think so. - Two tequilas. - Coming up. - You think I'll like it? - I think you'll love it. [laughs] Thanks so much for joining me tonight, Mimi. Just needed to get out for a bit. - Well, everybody needs a little me time every once in a while. - That's true. - Hey ladies, my name's Guy. Can I buy you guys a drink? [laughs] Well hello, Guy. My name is Mimi, and this is Sophia. - Yeah, I've seen Sophia here before, but you're new. - Yes I am, I just arrived. And we're both drinking margaritas. - Okay, great. - I love them. - Okay, I'll be right back. - Thanks, Guy. - I never had these before, they're so good. They make me feel a little funny. [laughing] - Really? - I knew our paths would cross again. - Do you know these guys, Mimi? - No, I've never seen them before in my whole life. - You can't hide behind that makeup and that pussy-ass dress. - I'm sorry sir, I think you have me mistaken with somebody else. - I don't think so. - Put her down! I'm calling the police. - You ain't calling the police, gimme that phone. - Don't hurt us! - Don't hurt us. [laughs] - Stop! You're wrinkling my shirt, and you need a mint really bad. Stop. You should be ashamed of yourself, trying to hurt a defenseless woman such as myself. Please stop. - Come on, payback time. - What the hell's going on over here? - [snaps] MJ, MJ, return. - Yeah, that's right, that's right, she can kick our asses all by herself. - You wouldn't. - Sure is, buddy. [shouting] Sophia, who dressed me like this? - You've got nerve. - I've got my skivvies on. - Knife fight? - Yes, yes! Tequila, tequila, tequila. Behind you, behind you. [shouting and Latin music] - You gotta do it yourself. - Oh yeah, I like the tequila. All right, you guys want some more? - Yo. - All right, come on. You and me. One and one, mano a, whatever the hell you are. Come on, right now. - Okay? You know, I think I'm just gonna go home now. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna just walk off. - Don't you walk away from me. - Don't you walk... - Rawr. Okay, put that down, Sophia. [laughing] Get over here. - Help me up. Easy easy easy easy. - I am so tired of her kicking our asses. - Yeah, that's one hell of an ass kicking. - We shall never speak of this. [moaning] Where'd you learn to do that? - Over in Thailand, quiet. - Yeah, right there. [phone rings] - Dirk, I've been calling you at the hotel. You guys must've had some night. - Yeah, we ran into a little trouble. - What trouble? I said no trouble. - Not to worry. We got the situation well in hand, we're dealing with it. - Where are you? - Ooh yeah, let me get back to you on that. - What, when do you expect to begin? - Let me get back to you on that, oh.

May I escort you to the party? - Yes, you may. Has Sophia's associate Carl arrived? - Wow. Unfortunately, yes, yes yes yes. - You don't like him? - No, I don't. I think of him as I would a... Let's just say I don't like him, let's leave it there. - You don't find him stimulating? [laughs] - You're bullshitting me, right? Excuse me. - What's the matter, Craig? - Yeah, is everything ready? Y'all better be on time. - Not a problem. Dagger circumcised our watches and analyzed the parameter variables. - What the fuck's that mean? Circumcised watches. Stupid ass man. - Hey. - Hello Craig. - Annabelle, hello, how are you? I have someone I would like to meet. Mimi? Say hello to Annabelle. - Hello Annabelle, it's very nice to meet you. - I believe we've already met. - No, I don't think so. If I had met you, I would have remembered such a delightful woman as yourself. - Uh-huh, excuse me. Who is this, and what have you done with the Marine? - This is Mimi. - I believe we've been introduced already. - Yes. [laughs] - And this is MJ. [snaps] - Hey Annabelle, what's going on? It's good to see you. - Craig, what are you up to? - How did I get here? [snaps] Oh my goodness Craig, I think I had a momentary blackout. - Oh my goodness. - I have a bit of a headache, would you mind if I went and got a refreshment? - Not at all, dear. - Thank you, I'm sorry, excuse me. - Dainty little thing, take care of yourself, I'll be right there. - Sorry. - Let me guess, you used hypnosis. Nothing I did worked? - Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please? At this time, I would like to show you the reason we are here today. Someone will soon be the proud owner of a very valuable piece of history. But more importantly, we are here today so that we will soon see the happy- - Let's see the egg already. - Very well. Without further ado, Lilly, if you please, the Faberge egg. [applause] - That looks good, thank you. That's so much better. - Haven't I seen you someplace before? - [laughs] I'm sure you say that to all the pretty girls, don't you? [snaps] - I know. Weren't you that girl at the Mothsburg party two weeks ago? Seemed we had a thing going. - Hey, I don't wanna lie to you buddy, all right? Hey, Craig. It's good to see you, too. But who dressed me? Look at me, I mean, what is this? - I wonder, garbage, whose this is? - What? [gun fires] [shouting] - Everybody into the patio. Move it now. Move, move, move. - You think you'll move quicker if I shoot you in the leg? Go! Move. You waiting for an invitation? Go, go. - Get up, please. Get up Craig, get up Craig. Craig, get up, please. - Go go go go, move. Left foot right foot, left foot right foot. Would you care to join us? - No thank you. - Oh, please do. - Come on, come on, come on. Come on, there. Purse, please. - There's nothing much in it, just some lipstick. Fuchsia, very good color for you. - Thank you, join the others? - No thank you. - I insist. - Okay, all right. - As my associates pass among you, please put all wallets, cash, jewelry, and purses in the bags. Any funny business, we'll shoot you. - Move. - Where'd they go? - Carl. - I was worried about you. Where's the egg? - What? No, what's going on? - I don't know. They look like desperate men, we should do as they say. - Get down, give me those, right here. - No no no! - Are you eating again? Give me that pie, give me that pie. Get off! Are you blind? Get over there, get over there. - You, watch. Now. No funny business, or we'll shoot you. - Wait a minute, did he just wink at you? - No no no, I spit in his eye. - That looked like a wink. - Really? - Deposit it, baby. - Boys, a little something for your collection. - Why don't you come join us, now? Give me the wallet, drop it in. - Emergency. No no no no, don't put me on hold, don't put me on hold. Rockefeller Warehouse. Turn right, turn right, and then there is a big house. - Take off her ring. - Gimme the watch. - 333 Northeastern Way. Please hurry, please hurry. [shouting] - Craig? - Fight, lover boy? - I love when the plan comes together. - Okay, that's all of it, now what? - We cuff them. Everybody, hands behind your back. - Get down. - Cuff her. - Stay right there. Carl, hold this. - I knew he winked at you earlier. - Oh, for crying out loud. - [Sophia] Carl, what the hell are you doing? - Shut up, Sophia. You know what I'm doing. I'm asserting my importance to the foundation. - You won't get away with this, Carl. - Sure I will, and most importantly, I'll get away from you. - [Mimi] Take your hands off of her. - What's that? - [Mimi] I said, please, get your hands off of her. - Is the little Marine giving orders? Hold this, you idiot. I give the orders around here. One word from me, and I can take you out just like that. [snaps] - Carl, why am I tied up like this? - What? - Please untie me, it's hurting my wrist, please. - You're still hypnotized. - What are you talking about, Carl? [snaps] Untie me, asshole. [shouting] - Hey hey hey hey hey hey. If you plan on seeing five more minutes, I would get off of him, you insufferable bitch. Get up. Okay, that's it. Gimme the egg. Gimme the egg, gimme the egg now. I saw you with it, gimme the egg. Where is it? You know what, I'm doing this all wrong. Give me the egg. I'm gonna put all your blood in this, gimme the egg. - Give him the egg, dear. - Now. - Okay, it's down there. - Where? What, in there? - Not there, down there. - Really? Don't you move. [laughing] Now you, superwoman, get over here. - Carl, so far it's just a robbery. Don't make it a murder rap. - Not to mention breaking and entering, battery, assault with a deadly weapon, and if it is murder, that is possibly the death penalty. - Okay, she's not helping, but she does make a good point. - Oh, shut up. - Spineless bastard, why don't you do me? - Gee, I'd like to, but I don't have time. - What, because I'm not tied up? - Because you're a girl. - I am a Marine at heart. - Oh yeah. Snap your finger, now. [snaps] Mimi? - Carl? [snaps] You make me puke. - Snap your finger, do it. [snaps] - Carl, where do you keep going? - Next person that snaps their finger, shoot 'em. - Listen, MJ, MJ, you're being hypnotized. Come back to us, you've gotta snap out of it. - Shut up. - Please, MJ. - Shut up. - She's telling the truth. - Shut up. - MJ. - Carl. [shouting] - Craig, you've gotta go and help MJ. She went that way, towards the stables. - Hold on, right there, right there. Pat him down, pat him down. - This is not happening to me. - I'll shoot you. - Are you gonna shoot me? - Oh, I'll shoot you. - I don't want you to shoot me. - It's mine now. - Get off of me. - You're caught. - Okay tough guy, all right. - Give me the pretty. - You want this? - I'm a little old for that. - All right, come on out. You know, you're a real pain. Come on out. [yelling] - Hey! Mine's bigger. - Yeah? You want some more? - Freeze. Get up, get up. - You gonna take me? - No, I have an appointment tomorrow to get my teeth cleaned, I'm going home. - Get over here, stop fighting. Get over here, stop fighting. Get over here. - Ouch. I mean... [gunshot] - Craig. Are you okay? Craig. - Am I dying? I hope not. - Are you okay? - I don't know, I heard a shot. Hell of a party, huh? I don't wanna die. I feel like I'm dying. I hope I'm not dying. - I saved the egg. - Wow. How about saving my life? Can you save my life? And if you cook for me, I'll show you to put one of these together with one hand, how about that? Oh no, I think I'm gonna faint. I am. - You look beautiful. - Thank you. There's two, one for you and one for me. - Is it alcoholic? - Would you like it to be? - Yes. - Okay, it is then. - A toast. - To... To never getting shot again. - Oh, I can do that. Let's drink to a whole bunch of things. To... Well, just one thing really matters, that's you. So, to you. - To you. - To us. - To us. Dinner shouldn't be long. [doorbell rings] Oh, there it is now, excuse me. - There's what now? - Oh, nothing. - You're joking, we were supposed to... I'm gonna kill 'em, I've had enough of this. - Here we go. - Wait a sec. You cook and then bag your food? [laughs] That would be unique, I guess. - I know I told you I was going to cook. I said I would show you how, but- - To put the gun together. - If you cook dinner. And I'm going to- - Show me anyway. - Anyway. - We're gonna eat here at this table, so we can't leave it like- - I'll do it. I'll show you. - Hey Craig, Craig- - It's kind of like, I got it. I remember, this is kinda scary, not that scary. You go like... I don't remember really, I forgot. I don't know how to do it. - Can I tell you something? - What? - I've never told this to anybody before. You bring out emotions in me that I've never felt in my whole life. - You're gonna tell me you love me? Is that what you're saying? Say it. - I love you. - Wow. - That feels good. - I love you too. Ow, you hurt my arm. - Sorry. - You're stronger than me. Aw, hell with it. [gunshots] - I've eaten worse. - Nice breasts. Turn around. Great butt. Posture a little stiff, but good breeding stock. All in all, what is the problem? - I'm trained to kill in 10 different forms of martial arts, specialist in large and small arms weaponry. Certification to transport, distribute, and detonate all sorts of explosive devices. - Which means- - Which means I can blow your ass up. Wonder where Carl is. I think he might like this. I don't think this outfit's going to work. Oh boy. My, I do look a fright. - Somebody call heaven and tell them they're missing an angel. - Didn't see that. [shouting] I'm so tired of her kicking our asses. - Yeah, that's one hell of an ass kicking. - We shall never speak of this. - Only doing it for you, Sophia. You'll be proud of me, Sophia. I like this one. I'm coming, Sophia. This is working out. - You wouldn't. - Sure is, buddy. - Knife fight? - Tequila, tequila, tequila. Behind you, behind you. [shouting] - Well, if you must say it, you must say it, say it, so say it again. - You look very handsome tonight. - Again. - You look very handsome tonight. - Feels good. - I love you too. Ow, you hurt my arm. You're stronger than me. - I'm sorry.
