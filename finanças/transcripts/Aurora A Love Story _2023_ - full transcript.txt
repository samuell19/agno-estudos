So, you know, if you wanna let your boy have that room, you know what I'm sayin'? No, no, no, no, all good. 'Cause once you and Will start acting up, I'm gonna retire to my bedroom for some sleep. Kenneth, can I just have one more weekend with my boy? I'm right here, man. No, no, no, I'm talking about my boy, Kenny. Not like mature Kenny, not the Kenny that's about to get married.

I took him back a few times, but now I know that there are just some things you can't get past. He's still their father and the girls could have stayed with him. Nope.

Check this out. Bam! [laughing] You look good, Pops. You too. So, you sure about this girl? Dad, you been talking to Leah? Yeah. Everybody's on this Leah thing. I got this. Your sister can be a little... abrasive. A little? Listen, Leah been looking out for you your whole life. Ever since you were a kid. Your mom and I, when we first got married, we were still trying to figure it out. We put a lot on Leah, just like when Will came along, we put a lot on you. Don't compare me to Will. Nah, you ain't Will, but you did have your moments with the girls. Hear me out, KJ. Now, we ain't heard a peep about nothing serious since you know who. Then, all of a sudden, you pop up at Thanksgiving with Giselle, talking about you flying the family out to Puerto Rico for your wedding? There's no doubt in my mind, pop. Well, that's good enough for me. Let's get you hitched, boy. [chuckling] I love you, son. [Kenny] Love you too, Pop. -Still? -God, this is crazy. Nina, we have to go see what's going on. You know she would never be this late. That's enough. Just wait. All right, calm down. Everything will be fine. Just... Mom! -What was wrong with y'all? -[both] Runaway bride! If we leave now it'll look like something is wrong. Something is wrong. Have you ever known Giselle to be this late for anything? I mean, it's-- it's hair and makeup. You know, maybe they're redoing it-- We-- We just-- We just can't get crazy, okay? I'm gonna go get a drink. Let's calm down. Nina, this don't feel right. I'll get you one too. For my nerves. Easy, girl. [Leah] Everything okay? Mm hmm. Big day. We said we were going to have a day without incident. We're gonna have a day without something. You told Grandma? Told Grandma what? What part of "keep this between us" didn't you understand? This is us, I thought we just weren't telling them. Somebody better start talking. [both] Runaway bride. Would y'all stop saying that? What are y'all talking about? The girls overheard them upstairs. Apparently, Giselle is missing. What? When? They all went to get their hair done, but Giselle stayed to get her makeup done. They came back hours later, Giselle is still gone. Have-- Have they tried calling her? Yeah, well, they tried her, nothing. Not even the salon picks up. -Who are you calling? -I'm calling your father. No-- I shouldn't have snatched this. All right. You're right. Your daddy will just make things worse. So, what are we gonna do? And when I say "we," I mean you. All right, look. You go to the salon, I'll stay behind and keep everyone calm. But what about Kenny? He should be on his way down to the beach any minute. Don't worry about Kenny. I'll take care of it. Okay? -Just-- Just go. -How? What are you going to do? Sofs, listen to me. When you have eyes on Giselle just call me. All right? I'll take care of the guys. [upbeat song sung in Spanish] [Sofia muttering indistinctly] [Sofia] Christina! Where is everybody? [speaking Spanish] What? Ooh, girl, you just spoke English two hours ago... [screaming] ["More Than Just A Fling (feat. Ed Mils)" by spring gang] ♪ I found love ♪ ♪ For real love ♪ ♪ Let this be ♪ ♪ The real thing ♪ [sad music] You hear anything from her? You got something to say? What did you say to her? What are you talking about? I mean, you insisted on getting massages together. Did you two speak? Yeah, we spoke and I was just-- [Nina] Well, ever since these massages things have been different with her. So, what did you talk about? I feel like you're questioning me. That's not what's about to happen. [Nina] But you've been against this wedding since you got here. Did you say something to her? You're not about to blame me. If the girl got cold feet, maybe it's because she realized she was about to rush into a marriage and you barely know each other. See? There it is. Honestly, I have had about enough of you. No, this ain't about her. Your marriage is a disaster, and you keep trying to project that on everybody else. You're an expert on love? When do we get married? How long it takes to get married? You're finally happy, aren't you, right? -[Kevin] Kenny-- -No, Dad! She needs to hear this. Ever since we got here, you've been trying to sabotage this thing, and you ain't satisfied until you do it. Are you satisfied now? [Leah] Come on, girls. Leah... [Kenny] Go ahead. Go. Talk to you for a minute? Sure, yes. Where is she? Ms. Gaines, I don't know where she is. I need you to figure it out. You. That's your best friend, right? -Yes. -Well, that's my best friend. In there. I love him. Kind, strong son. And right now he is crushed. No. Whatever it is, she needs to come back, face him, and deal with it. Because he doesn't deserve this. Find her. [door slamming] They took her. -What? -[Sofia] Carlos. [tense music] [Carlos] Congratulations on your love and your marriage. It's a beautiful thing when two people find each other and choose to spend their lives together as one. I'll try not to delay things too much. For $2 million, you can go with your life as planned. If you call the police, you'll never see Giselle again. If you don't follow all my instructions, you'll never see Giselle again. My people are watching the house. Stay there. If you leave before instructed, you'll never see Giselle again. Don't do anything stupid. I'll be in touch within the hour. Where is he going? Probably to do something stupid. Not now. My car's coming in a minute. We got a ransom note. What? You're all right. What choice do I have? Don't know. I'm just saying... you should take a breath. Make sure you're being smart about this. I know Giselle, Dad. Nina said that this guy is crazy. This dude, after they broke up, he stalked her. That's part of the reason why she left Miami. And you found her. All the way here, in Puerto Rico. I have to pay the money. You know... All I ever wanted was what Mom and you had, Dad. Family. Love. Some kids. Giselle is the missing piece. And I can't lose her. [Leah sighing] What? I haven't said a word. Now's not the time not to have an opinion, Leah. Y'all just finished blaming me for the girl leaving. [Tanya] Leah... $2 million is a lot of money. And she's worth it. No, I'm saying $2 million is a lot of money. You are a regular guy. She's a regular girl. Why does anybody think you have that much money? Ooh. What if she knows you're rich? No, for real, think about it. If they're asking for $2 million then they must know that he can pay $2 million. And if somebody knows that he can pay $2 million then somebody knows he's rich. Did you tell her? -No. -You sure? Well... Maybe she found out. Maybe she ain't kidnapped. What? Leah had her suspicions that she was marrying you for your money. Just throw me under the bus. She finds this older guy, finds out he has money. No, no, that's not it, Dad. I know Giselle. She told me all about this dude. She doesn't want to have anything to do with him. -Tell them no. -What? Tell them you have no way of getting $2 million. You're a music teacher. No. Think about it, Kenny. They insist, then you know the know you can pay. But if they lower the amount, they were just fishing. But Nina, how did find her? [Nina sighing] [phone ringing] That's not mine. My phone is right here. [phone ringing] [Rianna] Who's bag is this? That's my bag. [phone ringing gets louder] This is not my phone. Hello? Go get Kenny. Can I talk to her? [tense music] -Who is this? -[Sofia] Carlos. -Yeah, I-- -Hold on. Put it on speaker. Where's Giselle? [Carlos] Let's not get confused. You don't ask the questions. You answer the questions. Here is the only question that matters right now. -Do you love Giselle? -Listen, man-- [Carlos] Okay. I got my answer. -[gunshot] -[screaming] [call disconnecting] Hey. Mom, can you please take the girls upstairs, please? [phone ringing] [Carlos] That was like practice. When you don't cooperate bad things happen, okay, Kenny? I frightened her, but I did not hurt her... this time. Let's try it again. Do you love Giselle? -Yes, I love her. -[Carlos] Very good. Okay. Are you prepared to transfer the funds? I don't have $2 million. -$2 million? -[Carlos] Wrong answer. [footsteps echoing over phone] Hello? Hello? [Carlos] I'm sending a photo. Please look at the phone. [phone dings] Is it your cell? Is she-- Is she hurt? [phone dings] Oh... [Carlos] So, Chris. Kenny. what's in a name? Right? I know you have the money. You know you have the money. I don't blame you for trying, though. I would have tried to bargain, too. That's why I only ask for half of the four million you are worth for the privilege of marrying this beautiful woman. Seems fair. Look, man, it's Christmas Eve, man, I can't get the money to you until Monday when the banks open. [Carlos] Would you like me to spend the next 36 hours with your beautiful wife? Or would you like me to help you get this over with faster? Kenny, that was a question. Would you like to get this over with? Yes. [phone disconnecting] -That's no good, pa pa. -Who the hell are you? -This is my-- -Cousin, Pedro. Everybody call me Primo. [Tracy] He's going to help us find Giselle. Listen. Puerto Rico is a beautiful island. You know, beautiful beaches, beautiful people. Boricua? Dominicana? [Tracy] Primo, come on, man. -Sorry, man. My bad. -[Tracy] It's not the time. Listen, 90% of the island is sweet. Seems like y'all dealing with the other 10%. everywhere on the planet has a 10%. Know what I'm saying? No, can you get to what you're saying? I don't know a Carlos, but if it's in Puerto Rico and it's illegal I know the guy to go see. If I pay this money... Can you guarantee that I get Giselle back? That's why I'm here, pa pa. He can pay $2 million. Nina, what was on the phone? I don't know, Sofia, I'm over here with you. Okay, don't snap at me, I'm just asking. Well, don't ask me. Ask him. We're going to go see his people. -Yeah. -Listen y'all, stay by the phones, okay? Stay here and be ready. Be ready to do whatever it is you have to do. This is my hood. I'll do what I have to do. How this you're hood? You're not even Puerto Rican Boricua, baby. It's on my mother's side, you know, his father's side. Look, we good, we got you. Vamos. [tense music] Will, keep an eye on that one. Her last name is Xavier. I'm so proud of you. Rianna, remember how you found out all about that woman? What woman? You know who I'm talking about. We're already on it, Mom. So, you said the salon was just gone, huh? It's like it was never there. Oh. That's crazy. And you said they, uh... they just slipped that phone in your bag without you knowing about it? Yeah. That's crazy. I mean, you was the last one to see her, too, right? Look, my best friend is being held hostage. The man she was about to marry, who I thought was a schoolteacher, can somehow pay $2 million. I don't know what the hell I'm in the middle of. And the last thing I need is your little ass questioning me. [lips moving noiselessly] I'm not a little. I'm short. It's a difference. Yo, where you got me, man? Don't worry, it's my people. ["Duro" by Lu-Ni] Are you sure it's safe out here? [indistinct lyrics] Where's Charlie? No Charlie, Luis. I know you're not, Charlie. I'm asking, where's Charlie? Yo, you speak English? Oh, they pay him to sit there and look scary. Yeah. [speaking Spanish] Slow down, man. Bro, you don't understand Spanish? Nah, Bronx Spanish. It's different. [speaking Spanish] I think he said something about money. Yes. The money. [loudly] Oh. If I. Pay. You. Money. Dinero. Ch-ching. Will Giselle be okay? They Puerto Rican, not deaf. Dude, you're not helping. -Whoa! -Hey, tranquillo, tranquillo! -Tranquillo. Relax -Phone. [speaking in broken Spanish] Si. Pay the money, get the girl. Oh, see, we good. This wasn't so hard, huh? Oh, now you understand English. English, French, Latin. Even Chinese, if I need to. Charlie told me not to make it easy on you. Nothing happens in San Juan that we don't let happen in San Juan. $2 million leaves a lot of money to share. When this is all over, she's going to make sure everybody gets their piece. Got it? Any minute now, the music man is going to get a phone call. He's going to show him how to steal his own money by transferring it to a bank account in Puerto Rico that's friendly in these matters. She's like a regular person. I mean, she has a good job and her address is right here on her LinkedIn page. Yeah, guys, I don't think it's her. But the phone was in her bag. She tried to act like she didn't know it was there. But she knew. Mm, I don't think so. She's nice. You think everyone's nice. -I don't like the other two. -Right? You saw how crazy she got when she thought she was in my picture. Girl, my followers ain't even think about you. Your followers ain't even thinking about you. [Leah] I mean, who doesn't have social media? Kenny loves that about her because he thinks she's all private, but it's like she's a ghost. Man, nothing. Right. I'm going to call Tracy. They should have been here by now. Go back to Nina Vidal. I think I saw something there. All we saw was this college thing. [Lee] Is that her? She definitely had a glow up, because... Look at that one. [both snickering] Miriam Vidal? But I thought her name was Nina. [both] What? Can you please stop pacing? [Sofia] You have $2 million? Have you heard of Gwen Stefani? Or Cassie? Bro, what are you doing? Nah, bro, no more secrets. I wrote and did some of their music for some of their biggest hits. But the music industry wasn't for me. So, yes, I have a lot of money. I have $2 million. [tense music] I'd have gave $10 million to get this over. Hey, bro, what happened? [Tracy] She's going to be fine. -It's just about the money. -[Kenny] She all right? -Yeah. -You believe 'em? Yeah, I do. All right, man, this is my baby girl. We're going to get her back. I got you, bro. Meet me upstairs in two minutes. You were right. We have to talk. [Rianna] Mom. It was her this whole time. Nina Vidal, AKA Miriam Vidal. -Divorce court? -We watched the whole episode. He cheated on her and messed up her credit. -Well, what does that-- -That's when it got crazy. She stole his identity. Stole his mom identity. His grandma's too. She took everything. But she got caught. Turned the girl into a criminal. [Lee] Miriam Vidal. She's wanted in, like, five states. This is her thing. She fakes her own kidnaping and takes the money, and then she just runs off like nothing happened. Something ain't right. Now it makes sense. You don't seem surprised. He kept on saying "she" the whole time. My Spanish is a little shaky, but I definitely understand "she." Like, "She's going to let her go." Or "She's going to make sure everybody gets their piece." And then the other night when I was hanging out with her, she kept asking me questions about Kenny. At first, I thought she was a concerned friend. But now-- -She played you. What did you tell her? I didn't tell her anything. I said she wouldn't have to worry about money, but... I didn't say anything specific-- where you going? She's down there right now acting like she's all broken up. She playing us. Like I'm the one who ran the girl off. They still have Giselle. And I plan to make her tell me who. Or, she can lead us right to her. Yo, come upstairs. Yeah. Yeah, but don't like-- just come up here and sneak, okay? Well? Trust me. You know that boy can't hold water. You might as well make a damn announcement. [Tracy] Trust me, Leah. -[Will] What's up? -Come here. -We've got our stalker woman. -What? It was Nina the whole time. Ooh, snap. Y'all wasn't gonna tell me that?

[Nina] You brought this to me, remember? I met this guy at a career day. He's filthy rich. I know, but I made a mistake. We are so close. This man is on his way to the bank at this very moment to get $2 million for us. Don't you see? All the guys, all the girls, all the petty scams have led us to this moment here. This money is going to change our lives. But that's just it. That's not me. That's you. My life has been changed already. While I was pretending to fall in love with him He actually fell in love with me, and it changed me. Love. And what about my life? Hmm? So, what, so you-- You end up marrying this man, And then a year from now, you realize you're actually in love with the money. You get a divorce and then get half of $10 million. Mm hmm. You told me he was worth four million, but the pretty one slipped a little something in a rather compromising moment. We said the family was off limits. But he's not family, though, is he? You see, unlike you, I respect rules. It's always a con with you, Lex. It doesn't bother me because I know you. But you've had a soft spot for this guy since the very beginning. And I should have seen it. He doesn't deserve this. You are an amazing actress, Alexis, I mean, really. You go so deep that you don't even know when to call cut. Giselle Xavier is a character, and in an hour or so, the show is over. We are so close, baby. Nina, can we just-- What-- What exactly do you think is going to happen? What? You come clean. You tell him that you're sorry. And then what? You two live happily ever after? You fell in love with the mark. It happens to the best of us at first. But he'll never forgive you. And if you think he could, he'll never trust you again. It's too late to turn back now. Now. We good? Can I see the dress? It's in the house. Come. Thanks for calling me. She's cracking. I knew it. I'm out of here. I'm not taking the fall for this. No one is going anywhere. We put a contingency in place, did we not? Get yourself together? We knew this was a possibility when we started. Now, do you want to split $2 million? Or do you want to go back to prison? We do what needs to be done now. [Leah] How well do you know these girls? I'm here. You okay? I'm fine, baby. We don't have much time. Okay. Where's Carlos? -He's not coming. -What? -Okay, let's go. -No, baby, listen to me. I made a mistake. What? It was me. I wasn't kidnapped. I was just running away. No one has ever loved me before. I mean, truly and deeply loved me. And it broke me inside. But then you came along and you changed everything. I love you more than I love anything or anyone. Even myself. What are you saying to me right now, Giselle? So it doesn't even matter if you get mad at me and you hate me forever. I can't continue to lie to you. Go on. You did this to me? I'm beating myself up trying to figure out how I let this happen. [Nina] She planned the whole thing. You see, we found you, we studied you, and then created the perfect girl for you. Now we're going to sail off with your money. The hell you are. The plan was to take just the money. But now you can't leave the island. -[Giselle] Nina. -Neither of you. Okay, you know what? I deserve whatever happens to me. But just let Kenny go. Oh, God, enough. Alexis, really. It's over. Yes, Kenny. Meet Alexis Montgomery from Houston, Texas. You two get to spend the rest of your lives together, although unfortunately, those lives won't last very long. Baby, we can start over. No more secrets. Okay? Alexis... Now, you know about Alexis. Like I know about Chris Grant. We both deceived each other. But our love was real. Our love is real. And that's why I told her to call it off. I tried to put a stop to this whole thing, Kenny, because I love you. Baby, just look at me. Feel me. You two really are made for each other. Finish the job and you can have your share. That's what I'm here to do, ma ma. What? What is? What? It's always family first. [Nina] What are you doing? -You-- you-- -Move. Please-- Tracy! Kenny, take your money, let's go. Kenny, I'm so sorry. We can start over. No wedding, no money, just us. I'm sorry. Me too. Tracy, get everybody out of here. [Leah] What? What are you doing, bro? This woman is the love of my life.
