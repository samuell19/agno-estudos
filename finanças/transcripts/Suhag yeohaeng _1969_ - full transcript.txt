School trip...School trip. School trip ... When we first heard that, Nobody knew what it meant, since we've never heard that before. Gil-dong, who always wants to show off to everybody, said, Do you know why this is called a School Trip? There are so many different schools, so we're going to visit many schools. That's why. We all thought it made sense. The name of the island we live on is "Sunyoodo" It's just so beautiful even angels come down to see it. I haven't seen any though. Sunyoodo.... Grownups describe it like this... "The Scenery's beautiful, but life is hard here." Kids have to work as soon as they start walking. They're good kids. We don't have rice fields here, so we can't eat rice that often. By the time I'm 20, I don't think I'll have eaten 20 kilos of rice. Boat, boat, Take me with you. Boat, boat! Please take me. I want to go where you're going. Boat, Boat! It's 60 km to the mainland. Every other week, a ferry goes to the mainland. Half of the islanders haven't been to the mainland yet. To go to the mainland, you need a lot of money, so, nobody can't even think about going to the mainland. But, still all the islanders want to go to the mainland. The mainland... I dream about it every night. Angel! Take me to the mainland, just once. Then, all of a sudden, an angel made an appearance. A real angel,,, This is my school. We only have 37 students, from the 1st grade to the 6th grade. And, we only have one teacher and one classroom. Isn't it bizarre? So, we are like brothers. Darn...what am I doing? I was talking about the angel. Real angel... This is it...angel... -Our teacher. -Look at this. This is what a bicycle looks like. Before I explain... Has anybody seen a bicycle? I have. -Hey, you haven't seen one! -Okay. Everybody, go back to your seats. Have you seen a carriage or a wagon? -They are drawn by horses and cows. -Mr. Kim! I've got a question to ask. -What question would that be? -Okay, what is it? Yes. -What do you want to ask? -What is it? I've noticed that the bicycle has only two wheels. How come it doesn't fall over? He's right. How come? -Right. It has only two wheels. -That's really weird. -It is weird. -I don't understand. -That's right... -How is that possible? -Does anybody have a coin? -I've got one. right. -Look at this. -Yes. -Stop pushing. -I didn't. -I said, "Stop pushing." -I'm not pushing. Wow! -See? -Yes. Even one coin doesn't fall down as long as it's rolling. Then, is it going forward or backward? Ha ha ha...When you walk do you step backward or forward? -Everybody, go back to your seats. -Yes. -Be quite. -Mr. Kim. In the movie I saw last year, the wheels were spinning backwards. He's right. I saw that, too. -Right. I remember. -Ha ha, very funny. -What a yokel! -Who are you calling a yokel? You're from around here. Have you even seen a motion picture? Of course, I have. With Man-bok. -Are you sure? -I saw it in a tent. -I'm serious. -He's right. Do you wanna bet? If you saw it, how come you don't know? Are you a moron? -Why don't you bet? -Yes, why not? That's strange. Why does Teacher let them fight? How come he doesn't stop them? Hey, Soo-nam! -Yes, Mr. Kim. -What are you doing in the dark? Hmm... Who won the bet at the school today? About the wheels? It's not settled yet. Nobody saw wheels before... We don't even have a horse cart on this island. Don't you wanna find out? I do. But until we go to the mainland, there's no way to find out. Then, let's go to the mainland. That's easier said than done. -But, I'll go eventually. -Soo-nam! Aren't you eating dinner? -Hello. -Oh, my. -Hey, let's go home. -What are you doing here? Yeah, well... He's trying to make money to go to see his sister in Seoul, As soon as he finishes school he comes here to collect oysters. But, it's almost impossible with the amount money he's making here. -Don't even think about it. -I know what I'm doing. His sister said that she's gonna take him to Seoul and let him go to a middle school in Seoul. However, she hasn't contacted us for a long time. That's why he got impatient, and trying to go to Seoul to look for his sister. I wish I knew how she's doing. Mother...I don't have to go to a middle school. I just miss my sister. Wait and see. I'll go to Seoul during this vacation. Do you hear often from your wife in Seoul? Yes. I feel sorry for you. You guys are still young. I think a husband and wife should live together, whatever happens. I understand how she feels. I'm sure she's gonna miss you a lot. Darn, what am I doing? I'll burn the potatoes. Then Mr. Kim, I'll see you later. What? School Trip? When he joins the army, he'll see the mainland anyway. If he goes to the mainland too early, he'll think about it all the time. Jeom-rye wants to go to the mainland after she gets married. -She'll see the mainland then. -I won't let my kid go. What? How much does it cost? We can't even have three meals a day. If I had that much money, I'd use it for something else. -Mr. Kim. -Mr. Kim. -Mr. Kim. -Mr. Kim. -Mr. Kim. -Mr. Kim. Did you talk to my grandma about the school trip? -Did you talk to my mother? -What about my father? I met them but they wouldn't agree with me. I thought so. Are you serious about taking us to the mainland? Why do you say that? I'm so excited about it, but it doesn't seem real. I understand... I really want to show you guys the mainland. I want you to see a train, cars, buildings and a zoo. And let you find out if wheels go forward or backward. -Teacher, we want to go. -Please? -We're going, right? -Let's go. -Why can't we go? -Please? We need money. We can make money. After school we can collect seashells, and with that money, we can buy chicks and rabbits. When they grow, we sell them and make money. -I already planned this out. -Please. -Let's raise rabbits and pigs. -Please, teacher? Okay, let's make money for our trip on our own. Really? I'll buy some rabbits and chicks right now. -Wow! -That's great. Our parents were upset because we weren't helping with the housework. Spring passed... Summer came... And by the time summer was almost over... Sea King! Please help us to go on our School trip to Seoul. Please let us go, okay? Hey, guys! Guys! The pig's dying. -What? -It might have already died by now. -What do you mean? -Is it dying? -How about this one? -It looks perfect. -Sea King might be hungry, hurry up. -Right, right. We've gotta hurry to set the table for the memorial service, so sharpen your knives quickly. Why haven't you boiled the water, yet? Why do you care? -No, not the green one. -Should we use the red one? -Green means it's safe. -Wave it. Quick! Uh-oh! Hide. They're leaving. -Wave the green one. -Okay. Sh! Sh! -Damn it, we can't have a service today. -What are you talking about? The kids swapped the pigs. -The shaman got really angry. -Those brats! It's not their fault. Mr. Kim made them do that. My thoughts, exactly. Huh! Because of the school trip, -our kids are acting like thieves. -That's what I'm saying. We've gotta do something about this. You're right. I've got complaints about you from the parents. They're saying that you're putting wrong ideas in their heads for your own sake. For my own sake? According to what they're saying, you do this because you want to go to Seoul to see your wife. I know that's not completely true, but, you should know what they are saying about you. What about moving to another school? Is that what the parents want? I can't blame them. Kids don't help with the housework because of this school trip thing. It's big loss for them, money wise. I'll persuade them. I have no intention to move to another school. I know you're trying to help the students, but you should be patient. You can't just make things happen. When push comes to shove, they might not send their kids to school. Anyway, give up on the school trip. Ah, I almost forgot. You've got a letter from your wife. What? I respect you as a human and as an educator, but I don't understand one thing, no matter how hard I try. I was waiting for you to come during this vacation, but you didn't come. I'm losing my patience. Myeong doesn't know what his father looks like. I'm afraid he might forget about you completely. -I didn't know that you drink. -You didn't? I'm not a good husband and I'm not a good teacher, either. -Have a drink. -What are you talking about? The kids talk about you all the time. Oh! How's the school trip thing going? We have to give up. What? What do you mean? I just got back from a fishing trip, so I don't know what's going on. I was too naive. Did something happen? -Check! -He said, "Check!" -What's wrong with you? -What's the matter? You stupid idiots! Since we're not educated, don't you think we should give our kids a chance to be educated? What do you mean? They go to school everyday. Can they study without a teacher? Can a woman get pregnant without a man? Haven't you heard that Mr. Kim's leaving? Who said that? What are you talking about? Think about this. Other teacher's were trying to leave as soon as they got here. However, Mr. Kim's far apart from his family, staying on this tiny island. He's treating our kids as if they were his own children and he's helping us in every possible way. Who's trying to kick him out, huh? After he leaves, who will come here? Even before he finished his story, kids started running, and grownups, too... Everybody in Sunyoodo, had the same goal...the School trip. Islanders here lose their tempers easily but they're not bad people. Mr. Hairy! Thank you so much. We're leaving tomorrow. -You're making me feel ticklish. -Stop it. If you're dirty, people in Seoul won't like you. -Oops! It's too cold. -Stop moving around. This is too big. Why do I always have to wear my sister's clothes. Dear, you're big enough to get married now. -Wait, mom! -What? I heard that Seoul's water isn't tasty, so I'll take some water, too. That's a good idea. Mom, the rooster's crowing. Can you hear that? Why now? Everybody's going on a school trip today. There's nothing we can do about it. He'll understand. -My, why are you getting up? -I'm not sick. You can't even stand still. Don't lie to me. You keep your mouth shut. You can't go to Seoul. I won't let you. I'm not sick. I'm serious. -Look at me. I'm fine. -You little brat! -I'm not sick any more. -Why are you doing this? You can't go! When you go to Seoul, -don't come back. I'll be fine. -Okay. Just get a job at a restaurant or something, okay? Okay. -It'd be better than living here. -Okay. Wow! It's so exciting. What do you mean there's no doorjamb? -He's right. -Haven't you seen one? -What? -Is there a doorjamb at Namdaemoon? -No. -You're wrong. What the heck! What are you doing getting together so early? -I know. -I couldn't sleep. Stupid kids... How can you be so stupid? Namdaemoon is a gate, it should have a doorjamb. I'm saying there isn't one. -You're wrong. -Why do you say that? There's doorjamb on kitchen doors and even back doors. -Listen to me. -Namdaemoon's gotta have a doorjamb. -That's what I'm saying. -lf not, it doesn't make any sense. You guys, stop it. -I heard street cars don't have fronts. -That's stupid. I mean ferries and fishing boats have fronts. -You're right. There's gotta be a front. -Right. That's why we have go on a school trip, to find these things out. -Hi, Mister! -Hi, guys. -What are you doing here? -How are you? There's something wrong with the ferry, so it won't come today. What? lt'll take a while to fix the ferry. -Are you sure? -This can't be true. I can't believe this. Don't cry. Stop crying. How are you? Trumpet Shell! Trumpet Shell! This is Trumpet Shell. Answer me. Can I talk to the engineer for the ferry? I'll let you talk to Mr. Kim. Yes. Here. He doesn't know how long it will take. At the earliest 15 days, at the latest 1 or 2 months. Since it's fishing season now... All the boats are away fishing. Yong-pal was saying, "Mr. Kim, this is the last chance for us, the sixth graders." -The kids didn't sleep from that day. -Hello Hello, hello. This is Trumpet Shell. -He's got a phone call. -He's talking on the phone. Hello, I'm calling from Sunyoodo elementary school. Can I talk to the engineer... Please, I'm begging you. Listen, Mister! This isn't a ferry company. Stop calling us. This is an emergency line. Use it only in an emergency, okay? The kids are anxiously waiting for the ferry. The kids were asking Mr. Kim to call everyday. -Think about it. -Umm. They can use this emergency line four times a day. He calls four times everyday. I understand how the kids are feeling. That's why I'm here. Yes, can I talk to the head of the County? Ha ha, I'm sorry to bother you. Even the school principal called me and asked me about the boat. I hope you understand how they feel. I've also got my own kids, so I want you do something for them, -so they can go on a school trip. -Yes, right. -That's why I'm here to see you. -Thank you. Ah, Hello? This is the superintendent of education. I've got a big favor to ask you. Wow!! This is what the mainland looks like. I'm so excited. I haven't been on land yet. -Run! Run! -something happened. -Run! Run! -Hey, guys. Come here. Hey, guys. Come here. Stay right here. Don't be alarmed. This is a boat whistle for the train. It's just a boat whistle. Passengers for the 10:30 train to Seoul, board the train on track No. 1. Stop pushing. We've got to take off our shoes. I'm sure. -Take off your shoes. -Get on the train, quick. -We've got to take off our shoes. -Are you sure? That's strange. Where should we put these shoes. Up on the storage rack? You shouldn't take them off. You have to take them off. -Take your shoes off. -Put them on, put them on. -Take them off. -No, put them on. You can put your shoes on. -See? -I was right. -Check your partner. -Yes. Gil-dong's not here. Where's Gil-dong? -Gil-dong! -Gil-dong! -Gil-dong! -Gil-dong! Gil-dong! What are you looking at? The train's leaving soon. I want to see the wheels moving. Silly boy! If the wheels are moving, the train's leaving. When you go to Seoul, you can see wheels. -Hey, the electric poles are moving backward. -Hey, did you see that? The rice has grown already. -Look, they're waving at us. -Right. Do they know that we're on a school trip? Maybe. -Kids! Go backs to your seats. -Okay. Here are some snacks for you. I've got sodas and juice, caramels and drops, bread. I've got some dried squid from Wooleungdo. -Mister! / -Yes? -It that water in the bottle? It's water called soda. -Yes. -Soda? -It tastes so good. -How much would that be? -50 won. -No way. -What do you mean? -It's too expensive. Yes, too expensive. With that money, we can pay for the wedding for Bok-soon. -Hey! Take this. -What is it? This is Eundan. -Eundan? -You don't know what it is? -lf you take this, you'll get full. -Get full? -How much it it? -That's really bizarre. It only costs 20 won. -I'm so hungry. -It's not that expensive. -Let me have one. -Me, too. -Me, too. -I'll have one, too. Wait, One at a time. Wait for your turn. You, take this. This won't make you full though. This won't make you full... This won't make you full... -It's okay to eat. It helps digestion. -Hey, guys. -Don't buy things that you don't know. -All right. -Umm, yuck... -Yuck... Seoul... We're arriving in Seoul. We're arriving in Seoul. Oh, my. Look at these people. -Everybody, hold hands. -Okay. -Stay together. -Okay. -Oh, my! This house is really tall. -Oh, my goodness. I have a headache. Mr. Kim. I have a headache. -My head's spinning. -Are you okay? Huh... you're carsick. Everybody, lean against the railing and take a rest. All right. You've grown while I haven't seen you. -Look, he's your father. -He doesn't recognize me. Maybe. Kids, say "hi" to my wife. -Hello, how are you? -Nice to meet you. The kids wanted to see you. -My grandma sent this. -Oh, my! This is good seaweed. Thank you. -My mother wanted me to give you this. -Thank you so much. -Take this... -Wow! So pretty. Oh, my! Isn't that a necklace? -You can have this. -You have to say, "Thank you." -Thank you. -Good girl. Thank you everybody. Now! We don't have a lot of time. Let's go. -We've got to hold hands. -Are you that stupid? -Hey, let's go. -Okay. It's a red light. -You're right. -Right. -Get on the bus. -Hurry up. Don't push... -Darn, she's so slow. -Hey, hurry up. Move to the back of the bus. -Oh, my! My shoe, my shoe. -Oops! -My shoe. -What are you doing? Start the bus. Stop. Stop. Stop the bus. -Stop. -Mr. Kim. Hurry up. -Oh, dear. When is Mr. Kim coming? -Oh, my goodness! Everybody! Quiet! He knows where we're staying so he'll come later. -Are you sure? -Yes, trust me. -Isn't that Namdaemoon? -Where? Look, there's no doorjamb. -Wow, you're right. -He was right. -Let me see. -Let me see. -Isn't that a street car. -Where? Where is it? -It is really a street car. -Where? Ha ha...it doesn't have a front or back. -Ha ha ha ha -It's pretty funny. -Wow, it's really bright with two moons. -They aren't moons. -Those are electric lights. -That's strange. It looks like a potty. Did you hear something? I called and he's gonna be here soon. I thought Mr. Kim was hit by a car. Now let's go in and have dinner. Mr. Kim knows where we're staying so he'll be here soon. You don't have to worry about him. So let's go in. I'm not hungry. I'll wait for him. It's getting late. Aren't you guys hungry? I don't care. -Oh, dear. -Sorry about what happened. -Dear. -Were you waiting for me? I almost ended up in court but they let me go because of the kids. -How are they? -They're okay. They're waiting for you. They didn't have dinner yet. -What? Not yet? -Yes. -Here he comes. -Mr. Kim! Mr. Kim! Mr. Kim! -Uh, that's strange. -Uh...uh...uh... -Oh, my! -Let me try. -Let me try. -Wow, it's really bright. I want to buy this water machine. Let's ask the owner how much this is. -What is it? -What? -There...look at them. -Those girls are peeing standing up. -How do they do that? -The girls are peeing standing up. -That's strange. Stop watching us. Stop it. You brats. They're looking at us. Damn kids. Do you have any idea how long it has been? I was gonna come during the summer vacation, I couldn't leave the kids, who were busy preparing for the trip. Myeong doesn't recognize his own father any more. I don't want you be famous or anything. I just want you to take care of your family. How long are you gonna stay on that island? -How much? -It's 650 won. -I'll pay 600 won. -Deal. Give it to Myeong when he wakes up. He always wanted a puppy from Dad. NO, no, no, no. I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm gonna bite you. Come here. I'm gonna bite you. -Stop it. -I'm gonna bite you. -Peek-a-boo... -Peek-a-boo... -Peek-a-boo... -Peek-a-boo... -Daddy, do it again. -I'm gonna get you. -Stop it. -I'm gonna get you. You didn't have to do this. I can eat at the hotel. I wanted to cook for you. Wow! It looks yummy. -Daddy! -Yes? -You stay with us from now on. -Why? -I can eat yummy food all the time. -Okay. Stop it. Let daddy eat first. It's okay. -Come and eat with us. -All right. -Daddy. -Yes? Are you my real daddy? Of course I am. I am your real daddy. The other kids said that I didn't have daddy. Daddy! Could you talk to them tomorrow? -Soo-nam! -Yes. Go to sleep, it's late. When can I look for my sister. You're too busy. Don't worry. Let's look for her tomorrow. Go to sleep. -Wow! -They look like Westerners. -They're wearing nice clothes. -Right. Right, even the kids look like Westerners. -Their hair color is bright. -How come there are only Western dolls? -Strange... -Really. -Mr. Kim. I have to pee. -Do you? Here's a bathroom. Do you want to go to the bathroom? -Yes. / Hey, kids. -You have to pay. It's 3 won. Pay now. Don't you have to pay us since we're providing you with fertilizer. It's raining. This sucks. We got off in front of a school. This school was ten times, maybe 100 times bigger than ours. Mr. Kim told us to wait, and went into the school. I think they're on a school trip. -Hurry up. Get off. -All right. -Darn it's cold. -It's cold. -I'm wet. -Darn... They seem to be cold. Hey, they're on a school trip, and now they're stuck in the rain. Are you on a school trip? Yes, we're waiting for our teacher. -You came to see our school. -That's right. Then, let's go in. You're gonna get wet. -He told us to wait here. -You can wait inside. -He's right. -Right. -Thank you. -Come on in. -Thanks a lot. -You're wet. -Come here. -Thanks. -Come under my umbrella. -Aren't you cold as well? -Thanks. -Come on in. You too. Come with me. Come on... -I'm sorry to keep you waiting. -It's okay. The principal will let you guys visit this school. -Here... -Thanks. I feel guilty seeing you. Why is that? I'm here in Seoul living comfortably, while you're struggling on a small island. You were the smart one. Stop that... I'm not struggling. I feel happy about what I'm doing. -Huh! Look at them. -Huh? It stopped raining in the evening, Mr. Kim and Soo-nam went looking for Soo-nam's sister. She quit a long time ago because of illness. -Do you know where she lives? -Wait, let me see. Poor thing! She was talking about her mother and brother all the time. She was worried about them a lot. I think she felt bad about not paying the rent, she left a month ago and never came back. She was a good girl. Let's go. Mr. Kim told us not to go out until he gets back. However, there are always trouble makers. And they struck again. If you pay 2 won each, I'll let you watch TV. Mister! -Who wants to watch TV? -Here, 2 won. -Good... -Let's watch TV. Stop pushing, if you pay money I'll let you watch. -Line up. You go to the end of the line. -Yes. Sit. Everybody sit down. -I've got money. -All right, That's good. -I've got it, too. -Okay. It's gonna be on in a minute. Today, we've looked around old palaces, where Kings used to live. Next, we're gonna see animals who are enjoying this fall. And we met students who came to visit Changgyeongwon on a school trip. It doesn't seem like they're from Seoul. By the look of these kids, they might be from a small island or a small village by the sea. They seem to be having a good time here. -Wow, they look like us. -You're right. -That's us. -What's going on? Hey, everybody! -come closer. -Isn't he Mr. Kim. He is Mr. Kim. Where's that place? -That's Changgyeongwon. -Let's go. Let's go. Hey, guys. Guys! Oh, darn! Where are they going? I'll talk to one of the students. -What do you think of Seoul? -There's no night in Seoul. What do you mean? There are so many electric lights. If it's cheap, I'll buy one and take it to Sunyoodo. Ha ha ha, that's funny. What was it...? Right, Mr. Kim told us to come to him on TV. He said, "Hurry up." -Why? -I don't know. -Maybe, something happened. -Where should we go? -Well, where was it? -It was Changgyeongwon. -Right, Changgyeongwon. -Let's go. Have you seen my shoes? Hey, hurry up. -Haven't you seen them? -What do you mean? They all went out to see you. -When? -It's been quite a while. Where... Where did they go? They said that you were waiting in Changgyeongwon. You didn't say that? Where could they be on a dark night like this? You stay right here. We've got it. -No, we got it first. -Yes, this is our cab. -Haven't you heard "Ladies first"? -Stop it. -Hey, let's get in. -Finally. -Where should we go? -Well, I don't want to see a movie. Just drive. Why are you sitting here? We're waiting for our teacher. -Now? It's late. -What's going on? Hey! -Are you sure Mr. Kim wanted to meet us here? -I'm positive. -Ask Yong-pal. -He's right. -Mr. Kim's here. -Is he? -Mr. Kim! -Mr. Kim! It's dangerous. Come on up. Mr. Kim. You wanted to see us here. I didn't. What are you talking about? You did on TV. You even whistled when you said that. -Yes, you did. -Did I on TV? -We've been waiting. -Yes. Let's go. We found out later on, Mr. Kim acted like it was his fault, so as not to embarrass Gil-dong and Yong-pal. Do you think about Sunyoodo at all? I miss Sunyoodo. It's like my hometown. One, two, three days... We're going home tomorrow. Mr. Kim. I'm going to stay here today. Why? My sister might come to see me when she sees the ad in the paper. Don't worry. I'll be here all day. Okay? Then... Mr. Kim! I'm going to stay here. What is it now? I just want to save money, so I can buy a cart when I go back. What? A cart? -Yes. -Thank you. Come again. I think it'll be useful on the island. My mother carries seaweed on her head. If we have a cart, it'll be much easier for her to work. -You're right. That's a great idea. -Right, right. How come we don't have any carts on our island? -That's what I'm saying. -Right. -Let's buy one. -Could we please? -Mr. Kim. Let's buy a cart. -Please. I think it's a good idea...but, Gil-dong, do you know how much a cart would be? I have no idea, but my sister gave me 400 won to buy her some cosmetics. -Wow! -400 won? You're gonna buy a cart with that? And I've got some money, so it'll be 450 won all together. -Guys. -Hey. -Guys. -Hey, guys. Thank God. You didn't leave yet. -We're here to spend time with you. -Spend time with us? Yes, we're supposed to go to an expo. The students had a meeting and decided to take your students with them. What do you think? I'm totally up for that but I don't know what the kids will think about this. -Let's go with them. -I want to go with them. Okay, then get on the bus. Children in Seoul have fair faces and they are also warm-hearted. -Mr. Kim. -Mr. Kim. We've talked about something on our own. We want to invite these guys to our homes. -Can we do that? -Please, Mr. Kim. Really? It won't be easy to see each other again. So we want to spend some time together. -My mother said it's okay with her. -I can take someone, too. I talked to my mother yesterday, she said I could bring friends home. Me, too. -Me, too. -Me, too. My parents said it's okay. Me, too. -Me, too. -Me, too. -I'll invite a couple kids, too. -So will I. / -Please. I'll talk to your parents again, but, it's nice of you to do this. Are you letting us then? That's what we want. But we have to ask them how they feel about this. What do you think? I think it's a good idea. It'll be good for both of them. I really appreciate it. What do you think about this? -I like it. -I think it's a good idea. Mr. Kim. We don't have to stay at a hotel. -We'll save some money that way. -I think so. Why? Can we use that money to buy a cart or a bicycle? -Ha ha ha ha ha... -Ha ha ha. We also visited the National Cemetery. As you were. Let's go. About face! Take all your stuff. March! -Have you seen Kim Ah-oon? -He's not here. -Where did he go? -That's strange. Thank you, Mister. I feel so much better knowing that my brother's resting in a nice place like this. Okay, I've got it. Don't eat too much and behave. Sleep well. Hello... Ah, yes... Don't worry about them. Yes, yes, I'll let you talk to her. Jeom-rye! -Mr. Kim's on the phone. -Take the phone. -Go ahead. -Well... No, you're holding it the wrong way 'round. -Is this Jeom-rye? -Yes. / -This is me. -Hi, Mr. Kim. How did you know it was me? -Wow, how did he know? -Have fun there, okay? -All right. My, what's this? Yes, yes, I've got it. Man-dol, what's wrong? What did he say? He said, "Don't wet the bed." Father, please bless your sons and daughters from Sunyoodo, let them enjoy their time in Seoul. Heavenly father, please help them learn as much as they can so they can be enlightened. And I also thank you for letting us have this meal. Please let these son and daughters of yours... praise your glory. And I hope you will bless them. There's one thing that I feel sad about, and that is, on the island where these kids live, nobody knows the Gospel of Jesus Christ, his love and glory. Please have sympathy for them and let them listen to your Gospel and let them praise you. In the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord. -Amen. -Amen. Where's the boy, anyway? -Probably in the bathroom. -Go and see. I don't think he knows how to use the toilet. Let's eat. -Help yourself. -Okay. Oh, dear! Ha ha ha. Look at him. Guys, why don't you play the piano together? I want to help you but I don't know how to use stuff around here. You're a guest. Just relax. Wow, this is perfect for laundry. I'll do the laundry. Do you have any? -This looks perfect. -Is it? But we've got a machine for laundry. Bok-soon, come and take a look at this. You don't have something like this on the island, do you? This is a laundry machine. I was gonna work as a house maid but I don't think I can. Does everybody have this machine in Seoul? Why don't you stay with us after you graduate elementary school? You can go to school in the evening. Wow! You're the best. Thanks mom. You're the best. -Bok-soon you should come. -Okay. Soo-nam, where's Sunyoodo located? -Uh... right here. -Where? What is it? So this tiny island in the middle of the sea is Sunyoodo? That's right. When it rains hard or a storm comes, it'll be swept away. It's so small. -Who is it? -It's me. -I went to Hyojah-dong. -All right. I almost forgot. You should water the plants in the garden. I will. -Well... where's the outhouse? -Outhouse? -I mean, bathroom, toilet. -Okay, I'll show you. If you go straight, you'll see the red light on your left. -Well... I'll just go outside. -Do whatever you want. -Is this Soo-nam? -Hey, it was you. I thought your voice sounded familiar. I was looking all over for you. You were working as a housemaid here. I heard that somebody came from an island. That was you. How have you been? How's mother? Yes, why didn't you write? I wanted to wait until I had some money to send home. I didn't mean to take this long. I'm sorry. I don't know what to say. Soo-nam! Soo-nam! Go back to the house. Pretend that you don't know me. If they find our that you're my brother, they might treat you differently. Okay. Go... -Sisterhood relationship? -Yes. when I talked to my principal, he mentioned your island and talked about setting up a sisterhood relationship between the two schools. It's really nice of him to say that, but... So, we're having a meeting tomorrow morning. I don't want my students to be dependent on other people. Dear! I think it's a wonderful way to help each other. You're right. And I want to talk to you about something else. Don't you want to move to Seoul? There's a new school that one of my seniors founded... I recommended you and he wanted to hire you. Oh, my! This is a good opportunity. It's paid off, finally. -Thank you so much. -Don't mention it. I appreciate what you've done, but if I leave the island, who's gonna go there. The kids depend on me and trust me. I can't abandon them. I want to come to Seoul. However... I mean, those kids are poor. But when I see their pure eyes, I can't just leave them. I know you're a good teacher and I respect you for that, but as a husband and a father, how can you do this to us? What am I? What is Myeong to you? How long do we have to live far apart like this? How long...? How long...? Dear... When you left for the island, what did you tell me? You said, "Hang on for a year, just for a year." But how many years has it been now? I always thought, "maybe this year." I've waited for 3 years. I've wanted to live like somebody else. As a family, with you and Myeong. Myeong was crying looking for his dad... Now you want me to wait longer? It's not easy for me, either. Why don't you come with me this time? Don't you think about the future of Myeong at all? He has to go to school soon. -I can't raise him there. -Dear. There are kids there growing up. Though they're poor, they have beautiful nature and warm hearts. I know it's hard for you, -but wouldn't it be better than living apart? / -Go alone! -Dear! If I have to choose one way or the other, I'll choose to be in Seoul for Myeong. Guys! This is enough. You've been on the street car 3 times already. Guys! Our tickets are still valid, -let's do this one more time. -Okay. -Ha ha... Funny kids... -I'm sorry. This is the last car. I used to love riding on the street car. That's why I became a driver. But, we won't be able to see street cars anymore. I feel sad. Why? Are you quitting? I'm not quitting. -Then why? -They'll get rid of street cars soon. What? Why do they do that? Street cars are nice. Shit happens. When I was young and strong, street cars were so popular. When I drove this car, everybody cleared the road for me so I could drive fast... but now, I can't do that anymore. Now, new cars are everywhere. People don't like street cars anymore. Now, street cars are over the hill. Ha ha... you're right. That's why I can't drive street cars anymore... You young kids, you'll have a lot of new things. -That's too bad. -How much would this be? Even if we sold Sunyoodo, we couldn't buy this. Mister. -Yes. -How much is this cart? Why do you ask, little man? He wants to buy one and take it to the island. Oh, is that so You're from far away. It is far. We've got a radio so we can hear but, we can't see what's going on. If we have a cart, it'll be so much more convenient for us to work. If we work more, we'll be rich quicker, and then we can come to Seoul more often. Ha ha... then you'll buy a street car and take it to the island. I'm not bluffing. Watch me. Ha ha... you're funny. Why don't you go to sleep now. Sorry we couldn't serve you better, -but we let you ride the street cars. -Stop that. I had a much better time than the others, thanks to you guys. Is that right? Mister! You should visit our island sometime. -The scenery is so beautiful. -All right. Dad, let's go a holiday. I want to leave Seoul and settle in a place like that. My hometown was by the seaside. I used to gather seashells and swim. It was a beautiful place. I haven't been there for a long time. The hometown where I used to live is a beautiful place where many flowers bloomed in Spring. -Hey! -Sh! How come you're not sleeping? I don't want to wet the bed with my sweat. Sit. -What is it? -This is for mom, and take this money. Don't lose it. Be careful all the time. Why don't you buy some medicine for yourself with this money? I'm fine now. Tell mom not to worry about me. Who is it? Is anybody there? -What's wrong? -I think I heard a noise outside. Who's there? Is anybody there? -Meow! -Meow! I'll take you to Seoul next year so hang on. -Okay, you take care of yourself. -Don't worry. Who's there? come on in. -Why don't you go outside one more time? -I checked already. -Meow! -Meow! -Meow! -Meow! -Meow! -Meow! -Meow! -Meow! We learned something we never knew when we met the kids from the island. Even though they live on an island far away, they have hopes and they have warm hearts. When we think about them, we feel so ashamed because we have nice houses and a better environment, and we don't really appreciate it. We, members of the children's committee, feel that we owe them and we want to do something for them. And we came up with some plans to help them. First, we'll invite the sixth graders of Sunyoodo elementary school to Seoul, Second, we'll send stationary and story books to them, every term. Could you go and see if my wife's here? Is she coming with us? I don't know. We'll miss the train. Could you be quiet. I've got something to say. Ah... Thank you for everything. I've heard that you guys are doing a lot of things for us. We don't have anything to give back. I wish we had something to give you. I wanted to say that we've been like fish out of water. We saw so many new things, and some things were so bizarre that I even got a headache sometimes. You guys have been so nice to us. And the only way we can repay your kindness is that maybe in the future, we might be able to help you. We'll try hard to develop ourselves so maybe some day, since you're helping us out, we'll be better people. I've got a lot to say but, I think I'll show you by action. For the last time. thank you so much. Next...we, students from Jong-no elementary school prepared presents for the students from Sunyoodo. I hope you guys will find this useful. -See? -Wow! This is so exciting. I'm so sorry that I wet the bed. -Oh, my! -You, bed wetter. Thank you so much. -No problem. -When you come to visit me in summer, I'll give you a much bigger present, called a rake. If you want to eat rice with it, your mouth should be much bigger. You promised me that you'd show the sun, bathing in the sea water. I'm not kidding. The sun there is ten times bigger than the one in Seoul. -And you can gather seashells. -All right. -Meow! -Oh, my goodness. -Meow! -Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Take care. Don't forget about me. You, too. Take good care of my sister. -Okay...meow! -Meow! Now, we have to leave Seoul. We all had a good time here. We'll miss Seoul. However, we all feel so empty. Maybe because we're gonna miss our friends in Seoul? Or, maybe because Mr. Kim's wife didn't come with us this time. Where is she? -I'm going to call roll, so be quiet. -Yes. Hong Do-sik. Yes. Jeong Bok-soon. I'm here. Cha Jeom-rye. -Cha Jeom-rye. -Yes? Kim Myung-ja.
