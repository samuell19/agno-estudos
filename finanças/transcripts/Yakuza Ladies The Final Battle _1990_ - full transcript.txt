TOEI COMPANY, LTD. Presents Shall we count the votes? Today, on this auspicious occasion, we are truly happy to welcome the successor to the Nakamitsu Family, a most distinguished member of the Japan Yakuza Organization. Tadokoro Ryoji who has been named the fourth successor to the Nakamatsu Family was raised with tender, loving care by his predecessor, Nakamatsu Michio. The Organization has great expectations of him. Thirteen for, and two against... It's an overwhelming majority, isn't it? Take out the declaration of truce. You certainly are well-prepared, aren't you? Ofuyu... Yes? When is Segami coming back? He's supposed to be back in April of next year. So it'll be another six months...? I don't mean to make any trouble about something that's already been decided, but please don't forget that there was opposition even if it was just two votes. Segami has spent five years in prison in place of all of you. The Nakamatsu Family had a ceremony yesterday for their fourth successor to the family. Once that's over, they're supposed to declare a truce also... It was a long battle, so there are many who can't endure the prospect of an end, so please look after them. Please switch places. Let's make an announcement. Once they switch places, he has officially become the head of the family. The Lady Boss is back. Welcome back! Welcome back! Come in. What shall I tell the others? They're all wondering about the results of the meeting. Our gang will go on as we always have. Just tell them that. All right. I'm going to take a nap. Today's Tae's birthday, isn't it? Thank you so much for the nice gift. I promised that I'd get her a big stuff animal. Excuse me. In any case, are we supposed to be holding a truce from today? I wonder what the lady boss thinks of that. Never mind that... Make sure you take care of the matter with Daito Trading today. Excuse me... Chief, there's a lot written about it here. "Fourth Successor to Nakamatsu Family..." That bastard! What happened? He just broke the glass... It's nothing serious. Is anyone hurt? What's wrong? I've been hit... My stomach! I'm dying. Idiot! It's just coffee! Coffee? You idiot! I appreciate your continued patronage. Is the size the same as always? Yes... whenever I feel upset, all this glitter and sparkle is the best medicine. Is this Ms. Segami? Yes... I'm Ise Aikichi's wife. My name is Natsumi. Do you remember? Five years ago, when Nakamatsu split off from the Kawagoe Family, my husband went to Osaka in support of the Kawagoe Family, and... He was shot down and killed at the bicycle racetrack in Kobe. Actually, it was one of my young henchmen who blew out the glass at your place. What? Are you Ms. Segami? I'm pleased to meet you. I'm Ise Natsumi. I brought... ...this with me. This is Nezu Yutaka. I don't know what made him lose control, but for some reason, he thought you were somehow connected to the Nakamatsu Family, and he shot your glass out. This kid... I saw him This is the kid who did it. In any case, I owe you an apology, so I brought him over here. I'm really sorry for what happened. It looks like your young men don't know how to bow their head, do they? Yutaka! Hey, dumbass! Will you set things right? What do you want me to do? Cut your finger off. No way! What? I'd rather do hard labor in prison than cut my finger off. Nee-san... I'm going to turn myself in. Yutaka! All right... Wait! Let's talk! Never mind already... She forgave you... Yutaka! Listen, all of you! My dad was deceived by the yakuza in Osaka, and he was killed. All the Osaka yakuza are my enemy! You have a fine group of young men... When my husband died, I just couldn't keep things going. So I sold everything, and gave them all what I considered to be their retirement pay. But he's the only one who stayed with me. We lived in our car for about a year. That's a big difference from you, isn't it? Were you just hanging around Osaka all this time? Yutaka and I went up into the mountains and practiced shooting. I'm pretty good at it. Is it true that the Kawagoe Family is going to disband? Did you lose the battle already? When we split off from the gang five years ago, we were even, but now it's ten to one. It's no use fighting. Everybody's saying that when the head of this gang, Segami returns, you'll make a comeback. If you back down now, the dead won't rest in peace. My husband... I feel sorry for my husband. Thanks... Hey, Shinichi... Shake hands with Yutaka. When you blew out the glass, he spilled hot coffee all over his pants, and got burned real bad. Sorry about that. If I can't use it, I'm going to sue you. Don't drink too much. You won't stop bleeding. I'll give this back to you. Thanks. What is that? Those are all the people who were sacrificed in this last battle. If you include the ones who died from illness, and those who can no longer move after being injured, there are too many to count. You're not the only woman with a grudge. Ise Aikichi About this incident... I actually sent Yutaka out to get Tadokoro, the fourth successor to the Nakamatsu Family. I'll do it next time... Please take care of my burial. Wait until Segami comes back. Nee-san... I believe in Segami. You believe in me. I will. Nee-san! Will you let me stay with you? Please! All right. Do as you please. That's ridiculous! Don't take us for fools! Representative! Explain it to us in detail! The property holdings of Yamakyu Shoji Corporation and President Yamakyu are according to the report you see in front of you. They are being held as collateral by Heian Finance Company, and other financial institutions. Aside from the portion held for payment of employees salaries in arrears, we haven't found any property left to pay for your share of the holdings. What kind of a representative are you anyway? Get the president over here! The president is missing at this time, and the police are looking for him now. Don't give us that crap! Quiet down! Chairman. Wait a minute. Please sit down. Please... Go ahead. I want to ask the representative if there's any hope of finding additional holdings at all. By liquidating the stock on hand and collection of accounts receivables, there is a possibility of a two percent share... All right. Are you kidding? We paid seven million yen of our sales, and we'll only get back one percent? I'll have to hang myself. Work at the soapland. I'll be your customer. Don't let them fool you. Look at that woman in the kimono. I saw her in a weekly magazine... She's a lady boss in Tenman. She's a refinancing loan shark! This creditors' meeting was set up by this refinancing loan shark. The chairman and the representative are all in it with them. At this rate, they're going to suck up all the money that we were supposed to get. Give it back.. Give me back all my money! Otherwise, my business is going under. Give it all back! I want it all back! Give it all back! At this rate, we'll never reach a settlement, so why don't we leave the matter up to the two companies who are the most rightful claimants listed on this paper? I agree. Me too. I'll agree to it, too. Please help me! I'm begging you. Please! That's the company president's girlfriend. Where's the president? He's hiding between the white sheets of a hospital along with his official seal. We might be able to save about 500 to 600 million. This is your share Have you pacified the creditors? A number of them threatened to go through politicians to file a complaint. But the properties are all listed under a third party. We told them we'd sue them all for false accusation. They all have a fire lit under their pants, so they'll be gathering a blank power of attorney. I don't mean to interrupt, but will you take this all to repay my loan? I see... I'll be leaving now. Thank you. Well done... With this, it's paid off. It wasn't only her husband's defense, but all the young followers' legal fees and taking care of the families and funding the battle... That's all the money she borrowed. In just three years, she paid it all off including the interest. Segami found a good wife. You can't blame me for falling in love, can you? Mr. Ichiba... I need your advice on something. On the west side of Lake Biwa, between Imazu and Tsuruga, along the National Highway 161, there's a piece of land up for sale. I want to build a gaming house there. You? Yes... Now you want to become a woman entrepreneur? How much do you need? 500 million yen... 500 million? You plan to get it up and running with 500 million? Yes. I gave my woman a new business to run... It opens tonight. Will you come with me? Nakamatsu's head man, Konya will be there. The struggle between Nakamatsu and the Kawagoe Family is basically over. Segami's getting out soon. Konya wants to talk to you. Is that a condition of the loan? I wish you'd try to understand my position... Ofuyu... The only reason I've been able to take your side until now is because you're a woman. When Segami returns, I can't do that. I'm sorry for showing you something so trivial... Please forget what we talked about. Sorry to bother you. Hey, Beautiful! Do you always dress like this? When I sleep... I take it off. The deposit for the land is due tomorrow. Shall I extend it? Everything will go on as scheduled. Are you going to bow down to Ichiba? I'll get the money. Master! Give me another drink. Nee-san. Osaka's an interesting place, isn't it? Is this your little sister? She's beautiful just like you. Kanoko! This is my daughter. She's beautiful like me, isn't she? Don't be ridiculous, Dad! Thank you for coming today. Thank you for all the gifts, everyone. I heard Segami was transferred to a prison in Okayama. He's coming out soon. I'm counting on you to deal with Segami. He still thinks he's higher than Tadokoro, the fourth successor to Nakamatsu. We can't treat him on a level above Tadokoro. I've thought about it, but how about making him Nakamatsu's top advisor? If it were just a title, we could call him "God" or "Lord Buddha" for all I care! How's the lady gang leader? No good... She's as hard to handle as always. I'm not getting anywhere with her. That's your only weak point. Falling in love is my weakness. I see! You can't win! Hey, get us some girls! She's a real beauty. I found her in Ginza. She used to be a model. You're as busy as ever. What else do I have to look forward to? Good evening! Come on over... Sit over here! Come on over... Sayako... Sit next to the head man. She's a budding actress... I brought her over with my mistress. Sit here. I'm Sayako... Mr. Ichiba! See you! Thank you! Do you want something? Get in! We'll talk somewhere. Welcome back. Studying? Good girl. I started this law firm in Kobe the year of the Tokyo Olympic. I was self-taught, and got certified, so I wasn't affiliated and had no backing. That's when the third- generation head of the Nakamatsu Family picked me up, and put me in charge of the yakuza safety vault. I don't care what society thinks, but it's ridiculous how much money I make. You said your name was Natsumi...? If I took on the Tsuruga job, what's in it for me? Pachinko's not easy to succeed in. My late husband was blood brothers with Mitsuishi from Tsuruga. When I called him, he said he'd do anything to help me. What's the collateral? Just me... And the rest is my naked body. I see... Will you give me a hand? This is 500 million yen. Shall we go into the other room? Right here is fine. Marvelous! This body and your guts. It's worth 500 million. You're looking good, Dear. How's the boss? He's doing fine, but he's been in the hospital all the time. Munaki and Karachi came to see me. I didn't think they were that weak, but they were obviously Nakamatsu's spies. Dear! It won't be long now... There's nothing to worry about. Okay? I wrote to you about her, didn't I? This is Natsumi. I'm Ise Natsumi. I'm indebted to your wife. I remember Ise well... He would have been my right-hand man. So you're Ise's wife... You must be angry. She's quite a beauty. She has a strong character, too. She's doing a big job in my place right now. Boss... I want to exchange sake cups with your wife. What? What are you saying, Natsumi? I fell in love with you. I want to walk the same path as you for the rest of my life. How do you feel, Fuyu? Women should be able to exchange sake cups like blood brothers. Will you allow it, Boss? Forget it! Women can't become gangsters. Why not? Do you know what it means for a gangster to exchange sake cups? I know what it means... More than brothers who share the same blood... Stop it! Keep your voice down. You brought this with you? I wanted the boss to witness this. I'm going to prepare it. Nee-san... Please do it. Stop that! Don't stop them. Drain the whole cup. Natsumi... is this...? It's the ashes of my late husband. I want you to witness this too, Dear... Boss... Nee-san... I've been reborn. My life is in your hands... Same here. Aren't you glad to have such a good sister? From now on, you're my adorable little sister. I'll take revenge for Ise someday. Nee-san! This is it. Ofuyu's plan is to put in a large parking lot, a gaming hall, restaurant and a sauna... When the blueprints are ready, we'll handle the construction. So my job is to lay the groundwork until then. He'll give you a hand. I'm counting on you. The head of the Mitsuishi Family is here, Nee-san. Mr. Mitsuishi! You took the trouble to come all the way out there! Thank you for coming to meet me the other day. So this is the land? I have to hand it to Segami's wife... She found a good piece of land. She's getting ready for the boss' return. I'm counting on your help. Sure! I'll do anything I can to help. It'll be in honor of Ise, my blood brother... If he lived, he would have been the head of this Hokuriku area. My work's piled up to the end of the year. We've never done business with you before... If you could be a little more flexible... What is this? Payment in advance for the construction work. All this? Yes. Just as we agreed... You're from Fukui...? I see! Next. This is from your sister... Wait for me, I'm almost finished. How's my sister doing? She's with the Segami Family in Tenman, Osaka now. Osaka...? You're looking good. Not really... This is "ayu no ametaki" (sweetfish grilled in soy sauce and sugar). Ametaki? It's good. It's special. Is it? You seem a little different, Shiori. Maybe I'll go to Osaka, too. No... you mustn't do that. What happened to your left hand? I injured it Do they have a vocation in the yakuza organization? I don't know... Do you have a pistol? Of course not! Working in the office is boring. Shiori.. I'm going to become someone important with a grand foreign car. I'll buy a mansion and... Are you proposing? Thank my sister for the money. I'll buy you something from Guam, too. Shiori! Your ametaki! Damn! What's wrong, Yutaka? You seem depressed. Were you jilted by a woman? Don't be ridiculous. The "ayu no ametaki" here is good, isn't it? It's the real thing. Why aren't you eating? I thought you liked it. I hate it! What are you doing? Excuse me. Someone to see Ms. Ise. We all talked it over, and we decided not to take the work you offered us. We'll return the money, so please cancel the contract. Give us a reason why... Here's the money. How much did you bring? We brought the money you paid in advance... You idiots! Read the contract carefully. It says if you don't fulfill the contract, you'll agree to pay a considerable amount for breach of contract. Do you know how much in damages each of you will have to pay us? That's ridiculous! You trapped us, didn't you? What's that? We heard... that you just pay us some money in advance, and after it's finished, you don't pay us a penny! That's how you people work, don't you? Mr. President... Who told you that? Does it matter who it was? It was probably someone in the same business as us, wasn't? I'll have you know.. The Mitsuishi Family has nothing to do with this. It's the truth! I don't lie! Stop that. Nee-san... This isn't a trivial matter. Someone's trying to interfere. We found out where Mitsuishi is... He went to Noto. Noto? What's going on? All the bosses from the Hokuriku area have gathered there, and they're having a golf tournament. They were invited by the fourth successor to the Nakamatsu Family. What? Are you sure? We caught one of the punks and found out that they're all going to exchange sake cups with Tadokoro Even Mitsuishi? I got the information from one of Mitsuishi's punks. He plans to act as the head of that group. That fool! We can't let this go. Let's call the Lady Boss in Osaka The boss is getting out of jail soon. We can't involve her in this. But... I'll go to Noto. Will you continue the work here? It's dangerous for you to go all alone. Get ready, Yutaka. Okay. You'd better not notify Osaka about this. Got that? But... The one without the hat is the fourth successor to the Nakamatsu Family. Konya, the head of the operation and Terazawa, the head of the rank and file. They're all here. Shall we get them? Bear with it. Boss Segami is getting out of prison soon. It flies good with your driver, but your putter makes it fly just as good. You're pretty good, old man. You're good. May I have the honor of drinking from your cup? Thank you! Mr. Mitsuishi... Do you think you've become one of the fourth successor's underlings already? This is the best day of my life. My golfing leaves much to desire though... It's time to go... We'll start at 7:30... Good night. Thank you all for participating from early this morning. Our special guest, Mr. Ichiba has some magnificent prizes to give out, so do your best again tomorrow. Thank you. Good night. I'm going to do it tomorrow. I heard that the Segami Family was working closely with you... You mean the pachinko parlor? I squashed it. You did? I'm going to be taking that over eventually... You are? I'll be counting on you when I do. Shall we go? Mr. Ichiba! I want to ask you something. Wait over there for me. What is Mr. Tadokoro going to do about Segami? I don't know... Mr. Tadokoro doesn't let on what he's really thinking. Isn't there some way to help him? Why do you want to help him? I've been indebted to him since I was young. Mr. Mitsuishi... a sentimental yakuza will die early. Let's go... I'm ready for you... Can you do something about it? Who is it? Who are you? Natsumi! Wait! Please wait! It wasn't me! It was Nakamatsu's fourth successor. It was Tadokoro! Tadokoro wanted to get Segami's wife to back off before Segami gets out of prison. Tadokoro... Why? Why me? Boss! It's the devil! Welcome back! The chief said the boss is on his way here. He is? Aunty! Is this okay? It seems too plain! It's just an intimate gathering for family... All of you are going to join us. Really? That's what the boss wants. You, too, Tae! The caterer wants to know if 3 o'clock will be okay. That's fine. The boss is past the Takarazuka Interchange. He's going to stop at the third successor's grave, so he's going to be about an hour late. He is? Who are those guys? It's Tadokoro, the fourth successor. Boss... We had to meet sometime... He's late. He should have been here by now. Hello... It's me. The boss was taken to Nakamatsu's main house in Ikeda. You just let them take him away? We're jalking about Nakamatsu's fourth successor! You idiots! Get the car, Shinichi! Mrs. Segami... Come inside. If it isn't Mrs. Segami... Come on over here. Mr. Tadokoro... I'm Segami's wife. Thank you for going out of your way to welcome my husband back... Mrs. Segami... I've been waiting for this day. My predecessor must be happy in the other world seeing Segami alive and well. I stopped at the third successor's grave on the way home... Is that what happened? Mr. Tadokoro and the rest of you... Thank you very much for the warm welcome. Everyone's been waiting for your return at home, too. Dear... I need to talk to Mr. Tadokoro. It doesn't have to be today, does it? This is a man's world... A woman shouldn't interfere in it. Shall we drink a toast to Segami's return? I'll leave it to you, Mr. Tadokoro. You, too, Mrs. Segami. Congratulations on your return. Thank you for your hard work... Welcome home, Uncle. Aunty and I will sing a song or you... It's your turn, Papa and Mama. Are you okay? Pull yourself together. Here you go... Lemon water. I'm drunk. It's been a while, after all. What do you think about today? What are you talking about? About the fourth successor... I thought you said a woman shouldn't interfere in a man's world. It must have been hard on you... Welcome home. I have a good wife. I dreamed about you morning and night. Everyday... Let's go... ...in the back. I haven't changed at all. Chairman! It's Mr. Segami. Mr. Segami is here. Welcome back. I, Segami Masayuki, have returned. Is Ofuyu here, too? Hang on, Chairman! Segami finally came back, so you have to live a long life. I don't have to worry now that the two of you are here. Segami... I'll leave the rest to you. Chairman... Now that I'm back, I won't let Tadokoro get away with anything. I'm going to make a comeback, and trample the Nakamatsu. Family to pieces. Chairman...? Chairman... This is from your sister. Wait! Where are you going? Out of my way! What? Hey! How many strokes does Segami have? He's up to 6... That's two million yen. Do you know how many strokes that was? Who knows? You've hit it 15 times. Tell Segami that I'm betting two million on that putt. All right. Boss, Mr. Ichiba is betting two million on that putt. Two million yen? It's wrong to gamble on golf to begin with. Gambling is done with a bookie or dice. I heard yakuza these days even deal in stocks. Never mind stocks... if you don't own a building or two, you can't call yourself full-fledged. I know that. You're talking about land sharks, aren't you? Your wife is something else. I haven't done much... But the land in Tenman and the parking lot next door comes to over 300 tsubo (10,662 sq. ft). That land goes for 14.5 million per tsubo Roughly 450 million... This sushi is delicious. Where is it from? From Monta, in Hanamikoji. Give the chef a 100,000 yen tip. Okay. Ryoko and Megumi... Nice, young girls. Are they from Ginza, too? No... They're from Osaka. I'll be drinking at the counter Ryoko... Come here, Megumi. Have some sushi. I'll have a brandy. I'll have the same. What's the matter? Aren't you going to eat? Who's that? She's this middle-aged gentleman's wife. Beautiful, isn't she? What is it? Is my face that unusual? You're my type. Hey! Stop that! You'd better be careful. Tadokoro already heard what Segami said at Kawagoe's deathbed. Is that right? Doesn't it bother you? I have faith in Segami There's that incident with Natsumi, too. Your little sister, Natsumi sure had a great body. If she had agreed to be my woman, she could have had a life of luxury. Ofuyu... Don't you want to get out of the yakuza world, and be my wife...? I make an honest living. Excuse me! There's supposed be a grave around here for Ise Aikichi... Go straight down this road and turn left at the corner. It should be right there. Thank you! I found it! Here it is! This is it. Ise Aikichi Natsumi... Her name is on there. Are you the wife of the boss of the Segami Family? That's right. Who are you? I'm Ise Natsumi's younger sister. Now that you mention it, Yutaka mentioned that Natsumi had a really pretty little sister. That's right, he did! Yutaka gave me a savings book in my name, and there was a note inside. It just said to put flowers on Mr. Ise's grave. Haven't you heard from her? That's why I came here to Mihama. I heard this is where Natsumi was born. Is the yakuza world that great? I was adopted by our relatives, so no one knows that I'm her younger sister... But after that incident, there was a big picture of my sister in the newspapers, I told one of my close friends... And it spread all over. You fool! Why did you do that? I wanted to know how everyone would look at me after that. And? The section chief asked me if I would resign. Even the place I live... Did you quit? No, I'm still hanging in there. You have some good points. I just don't understand. Natsumi loved her husband enough to stake her life. He didn't seem that great to me. He looked like a snow crab. Do you have a boyfriend? I do, but after I told him about my sister, he stopped calling me. Please find me a job in Osaka. I know what you're going to say... No... forget it. A country bumpkin like me would never survive in the big city... Isn't that right? Don't worry... Look down on my sister. I'm sorry for saying something so selfish. Goodbye. Shall we get started? The mass media are out in force! It's time for the fall of the Osaka Castle. If matters like these are left to chance, there is a possibility that there will be an increasing number of conflicts without any benefits repeated in succession in the future. In consideration of the effects on the general public, we have decided to disband the Kawagoe Family. We give our word of honor to follow the provisions as has been stated. September 8, 1990 from the Kawagoe Family. That's all I have to say. Please tell us what your feelings are right now. Of course I'm heartbroken. It's unfortunate... However... In order to live in the world of chivalry, we cannot cause anymore trouble to society. What a great actor! Why doesn't he come right out and say it? That he values his life more. Yes? Boss... It's Mr. Ichiba. Turn that down. Yes... Are you watching the television? Mr. Ichiba... You took care of the Segamis in your younger days, didn't you? I still do. What's that? But... Segami is like a cancer... If you don't cut the cancer out from the source, you never know when it'll come back again. You're quite an evil man yourself, aren't you? Are you sure you should be saying things like that? Segami's someone to fear. If you kill me, you'll take a big loss. This was Chairman Kawagoe's dying wish... We all staked our lives, and did everything that we could do. Head for Osaka! What is it? I told you I didn't want to be bothered. It's me. Open the door! Fuyu! Your wife? I'll be right there. Wait outside. Why don't you let her in? What are you saying? What are you doing? Minabe! Everyone wants to hear what you have to say. At your age, are you jealous of me, Missus? Let me introduce myself. Thanks to you, I was stuck with a 7 million yen tab... My name is Yanai Ryoko. In exchange, your hubby bought me this condo. This place belongs to me and your hubby! Will you get out? Get out of here! Damn you! That did it! Get her out of here! Stop that! That hurt! Let me go! Tell me the truth... Natsumi, Okayama and I came to see you, didn't we? Did you already have everything settled with Tadokoro at that time? Were you deceiving all of us all this time? How about it? I don't dance to anyone's tune... I made up my own mind to take the best path. Listen, the Nakamatsu Family will become the Nakamatsu Conglomerate. I exchanged sake cups with the fourth successor, so I can become his top advisor. How naive can you be? You're the ringleader who opposed Tadokoro as the successor to the Nakamatsu Family. Do you think Tadokoro will ever forget that? He's just stringing you along. Do you want me to get killed? You're going to be killed anyway at this rate. Shut up! Listen... my life is not just mine alone. I'm responsible for hundreds of lives and if you include all the families affiliated with us, that would make it in the thousands. Isn't your rationality all wrong? What about your promise to the chairman and to Natsumi? You told them that you were going to get revenge for them. Hey, Fuyu! Is that woman more important to you than your own husband? Natsumi's a woman, but she staked her life to do what she did. If you had been killed, I would have done the same thing as Natsumi. The dead can't talk. I know that! Let's go! Hey! Mr. Tadokoro... are you having whisky and water? Two more whisky and water... What's your name? Behave yourselves. Sorry. She's Mr. Tadokoro's type. He goes for looks, after all. Thank you all for coming to the Nakamura Mitsuko dinner show tonight. For my next song, I'd like to sing my new song, 'Osaka Castle'. Hey! All right. This is a present for you from the boss. I can't accept this... Take it! Welcome... Shiori? Sis! Hey! It's Boss Segami! How's Mr. Tadokoro? Fortunately, the bullet just grazed his neck. I'm glad! Where is he? I want to make sure he's okay. I don't think you should. Why? You said it was just a scratch. After the incident in Noto, this is the second time it's happened. And this time she went straight for Mr. Tadokoro. Don't tell me that you think I'm behind this, and you're trying to cut me out? Just go home for tonight. Mr. Tadokoro's in a real bad mood. So when did you get to the point where you can order me around? Get out of my way. Out of my way! Are you looking for a fight? Let's come back another time to see him, Boss. Let me go. You tell Mr. Tadokoro that when I fight, I fight up front, fair and square! He knows that! I wouldn't use a woman to fight for me! Get Tadokoro out here! He's a pain in the butt! Get him out of my hair! He's just a loser barking up the wrong tree... No one's going to follow him. Just let him be. I'll leave it to you. There's no mistake that this is Ise Natsumi, is there? No... When they declared an end to the conflict, you and the late Kawagoe were the only ones against it, weren't you? You have guts for a woman. Ise Natsumi was your "teppodama" (bullet), wasn't she? You sent her to kill him, didn't you? Confess! What's inside this pendant... What does it signify? You must know what it is. Natsumi... It's Yutaka. He's an old acquaintance of Mr. Ise's. This way... Have a seat. Natsumi got her tattoo here, too. She had the same tattoo as her husband's... Two dragons climbing up to Heaven. Shall we go upstairs, Shiori? Thanks, old man. You're Natsumi's...? Shiori came out to Osaka about a month ago. She was working part-time as a companion... She was at that club, last night. But it was really by coincidence. I was outside... She told me to see to things. She wanted me to take her ashes, and bury them with her husband. Please take care of Shiori, Mrs. Segami. Yutaka... I won't let you get away with doing something without my permission. Nee-san... You understand, don't you? I'll take care of Shiori. Stay here until then. I'll be right back. I'll take this sake cup. Shiori... Aren't you glad? Mrs. Segami will take good care of you. I know it's painful for you, but you'll have to get her ashes. I can't go to the police, can I. You're planning to get the boss of the Nakamatsu Family, aren't you? You must be hungry. I'll make some ramen for you. It's instant, but it's pretty good. Yutaka! Look at this. It's a diamond. Is it real? I got it last night... ...from the boss of the Nakamatsu Family. What did you say, Shiori? You mustn't keep that. Throw it away! You don't know where this could lead to. Give it to me! I'll throw it away! I'll buy you as many diamonds as you want. But you mustn't keep this one. This belongs to me. give it to me! No! Give it to me! No! No! I hate punks! I'm not a fool like my sister! I'll never be the woman of a punk like you! That hurt, you fool! I'm sorry. Welcome back! What happened? Was it a retaliation for the attack? No. It was the boss. He said he was going to raid the Nakamatsu Family's main house, and when we tried to stop him, this is what happened. Where is he? In the back. When he went to visit Mr. Tadokoro to see how he was after the attack, things got kind of complicated. Welcome back. So you're back... How was it at the police station? Did they give you a hard time? No... it wasn't that bad. The cops are more understanding. That Tadokoro thinks that I'm the one who sent that woman to kill him, and that's fine with me. We'll start the war all over again. I'm going to kill that Tadokoro. Do you know what they're after? They're purposely egging you on, so you'll start a fight with them. I need money. Give me money for warfare... I need to buy hand grenades and machine guns... If you go to the Philippines, you can get all you want there. All right. I'll buy you as many hand grenades and machine guns as you want, but you will let me lead the war? What? Neither the young henchmen or the outside families will follow you. What's that? I know! Why don't we get you to retire? I'll buy the Segami crest from you. You know how much this land is worth, don't you? Say that again! You're a loser! Once you turn tail and run, you'll never get your honor back again. Shut up! I'm Segami Masayuki, the one they once called the Tiger of Tenman. Do you think I'll stand by quietly while a woman makes a fool of me? Kill me. Go ahead, and kill me. If you're capable of killing your wife, then there's still some hope for you. Just shut up! Shall I tell you something? When you kill someone, this is how it's done! What do you think you're doing? Take care of her Ambulance! Call an ambulance! No! Don't! We'll be the laughingstock. But... This is my way of settling things as a yakuza wife. I'll bear the pain while all of you, my husband, the gang and everything else remain obscure, and do as you please! You shouldn't move... Never mind! I can get to the doctor by myself. Teruo! Shinichi! Help me out! Wait, Fuyu! What are you planning to do? It's obvious, isn't it? I'm going to kill Tadokoro! Fuyu... This has nothing to do with you! This is Natsumi's and my fight I hope you live a long life. Boss... Stop her! If you let her go, that'll be the end of us! Boss! Shut up! What can a woman do anyway? Is this on Segami's orders? No! The boss has lost all his nerve and the henchmen have all scattered... There's nothing that I can do. All I want is to preserve the Segami name until Ofuyu comes back. Do you think she'll come back? Of course! Deep down the boss does, too. You fool! Mr. Ichiba... Are you ready? I'm ready... I'm not talking to you, idiot! I won't steer you wrong. Take what you can, and start a legitimate business. If you dilly dally, you'll get a glimpse of hell. What do you mean? None of you understands that women are ogres. They're devils. Mr. Tadokoro's dangerous. He's let it all go to his head. Minabe! Get close to Konya from now. From now on, it's going to be Konya's era. Stick by him. I'm in love with Ofuyu. While I'm doing this, I can see Ofuyu's face. It's the real face of the yakuza. Are you ready? Ofuyu! I'm coming. I'm coming, Ofuyu! Ofuyu! Turn left here. Leave the other cars. He's turning left. I wonder where he's going. He might be going to see his woman. Keep watch, Shinichi. I'm going to let the lady boss know where he is. Tadokoro's here somewhere. If we can find where he is, we can get him from the roof. Shiori... Shall we give up for today? We finally found Tadokoro... I'll do it. There's no rush. We'll wait for him to come out. But we don't know when he'll come out... We'll wait. Okay. You punk! The target's here. Hit me right here! Kill me! No! I hate this! Nee-san! Stop! Stop!
