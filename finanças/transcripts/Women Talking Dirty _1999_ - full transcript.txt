Christ. Look at me. I'm growing a beard. No wonder I haven't shagged, in ages. Well. Except with myself. Wanker me. A wank a day, keeps the tension away. The wisdom of, Dr. Cora. Wank. Women don't wank. Don't tell me, you're not a regular wanker like the rest of us, women with empty beds. It's the word. Yeah. There should be another word, for what women do. Stroking. Hmm... fiddling. Strumming. Ooh. Strumming. Ooh. That's perfect. Okay, Cora. And do you strum, in the morning girl? Oh. I couldn't in the morning. There are a lot of people about. Strum is great. I really miss, having someone to kiss I love a good snog. I miss having a bloke. Danny once made me, an honorary book. - Did he? - Mhmm. I quite fancy you as a bloke. Do you ever fancy it, with a woman. Well. I've often wondered. You know they'd have, the clitoral knowledge. Yeah. No more drippy drip. No more hope for fumbling's, and women with nowhere to go. A woman knows. Have you ever? No. Nearly once. But no. Neither have I. No, God! Hi Ellen. You look nice. I'll get you a drink. Hi Emily. Interesting smells. Hey Stanley. You're looking fabulously girlish tonight. Stand out, in a crowd then? In the outfit, you are a crowd. Hello! A huge pudding. How gorgeous. Rough, man enough was a great bun for a trifle. I've never visited Ellen before, what a lovely room. To her first, dinner party. May it be the first of many. A lot! That's me. Cora O'Brien. I left home at 18. By the time I was 19. I thought, I've made every mistake I could make. I was wrong. It's a big day for her. It'll not be the same without her. It's only a bit of education. That girl, gets a notion and just goes after it. Biochemistry? I think, she just fancies wearing the white coat. Come on, Cora. We'll be late. This is it! Now remember, Cora. When you get there, just don't. Don't what? Don't, everything! Don't do anything, you're planning to do and I'm not there, to keep an eye on you. How much trouble can I get into, studying biochemistry, mom? Trust me, if my daughter's going to have a hideous disease named after her. Bye! Remember, Cora! Just don't! What's fuck in French? Mm... fuck? I like French. Come on! Whoa! Look at this place. It's orange. I am... walking... through orange. Everyone's my friend! I love you all! I love you! Aw. You're so nice. Fucking hell! What did you get? Not bad. Oh! Look! Earring! Earring. And... sunglasses! Load of, absolute madness! Yeah! Cool hey? Yeah! I don't feel very well. She drank too much. Ellen. 20. Was a drifter. Lost in her own little world, of cartoons and make believe. Not wearing any knickers, are you? Not now. Ellen? Ellen? Gangster woman! Head to the streets, gangster women. We have sisters to avenge. Hey, that's quite good. Maybe I wasn't insane, to go into business with an half star student, with no dress sense. We'll make her a million yet. Pop time. Can we eat something good on this trip. Balance, gangster woman. You know. Something more blokey. I don't do blokey. You do now. I'll make you, an honorary bloke. A pint alone, will make me pee all afternoon. Ellen. Blokes don't whine about peeing. They drink vast amounts, and cope. You got to buy me another pint now. I'm broke! Three kids to support. You think, that I should cherish. Why do you bother? They're not even your kids. Well, it doesn't matter, who gave birth to them. You still got fate. Anyway. A pair of shoes, here and there reminds them, that I'm still in the world. Kids. Can't live with them. Can't live with them. My wife won't let me. She's with, the bastard now. It's him, or me, I said. Oh the bastard, she said. That's women, for you. Our boobs, are much better. Anyway what you need, is a blokey's trip. Some of them blokes, I'd go for. Football, lager. You should, now you're one. Piss off, with the blokey stuff. I don't feel like a bloke. Well, if I wait for you to finish. There won't be anytime for me, to buy you another. Frankly... I think, you'd make a crap bloke. I'd watch him, if I were you. I'll get you a towel. I'm all right. You're shivering. I'm a woman, of the wild. I've shivered before. It's quite cold, actually. Very, horrible. Here. Let me, dry you. I don't, like people to see my body. I hate it. Why? You've got a great body. I've got, one tit, bigger than the other. Oh. Really? Which is your favourite? Big one, or the little one. The little one. It's okay. Mm. I don't know, if the big one, is the best, you know? Let me, consider them, from this angle. What do you do? Oh, you know. Stuff. What, stuff? Well, I'm working on my PHD. - PHD? - Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to be... Dr. Daniel. Do you get a grand? Well, I get by. The shifts, in the bar. Oh. Mind a pint, Dr. Daniel Well, I pick up a bit on the horses, you know. So, you not going to answer that? No. Uh, mom? Hello. It's me. Cora. When you coming home? Uh. Just thought, I'd hang out here, you know? Um. We'll just have to come and see then. Oh! No, you don't have to do that. I mean, it's such a long way to come, and uh... Well. Actually, I've moved, I'm living with a friend, and he-- What do you mean, he? Oh god. Um. He? You living with a man? You, sharing a room? Why you not coming home? Oh, god. You silly bugger. You're pregnant. How did you know that? I'm a woman, Cora. And a woman, knows. This, um... PHD sounds, interesting. I'm always telling, Ellen... she should've, gotten a proper education. I don't know, Mrs. Davidson. Education. All depends upon, what you do with it. You know? A couple of girls on my course ended up working, in massage parlours. So, what is your chosen subject? Well, I'm writing a... dissertation on... on the post-coital conversations of women from different demographic groups. You know, what... what different women, chat about, after they've fucked. What are you doing, with that man? He's no good. How do you know? How do you. Not know? Mom, get up? I... Go on, tell her. Daniels asked me, to marry him. What did you say? I said yes. Three... two... one. Open your eyes! That is, fantastic! Oh! I love it! I got it for you, as your wedding gift. I'm going to curl up on it and I'm never, going to go out again. You know, sometimes... sometimes, we'll lie on this, and we will make love. And sometimes... sometimes, yes, we'll fuck. But, all the time... all the time, we will be fabulous. Fabulous Quinn's. That's us. And one day we'll have the fabulous, baby Quinn. A baby? Yes please. Just a little one, I'll put it in the corner you'll never know it's there. No, I don't think so. The place will, fill up with squeaky toys. Nappies. You'll get stretch marks and you, won't be fabulous anymore. I suppose. Fabulous, is what we're after.

Of those too. Yeah. She certainly makes a person, feel inadequate. I know, what you mean. What is it, she says in that song, um... It's truly expensive, to make a girl look this cheap. My kind of cheap, costs absolutely nothing. Well, you got to admire her though. There is a lady, who never gets herself, out shit creek. What if she died, should turn it into a theme park. Love it, how she says, "Darlin". "What's the time, darlin" I think, every women, should have a bit of a Dolly in her. Yeah. She's so sassy. She's a, one woman happy ending. Yeah.

You're not thinking about Daniel, are you? A little bit. Where did he go? Do you think, I drove him away? Was I too, focused on my work? No. Don't be ridiculous. If you ask me. I don't think, he ever really loved you. What do you think of love? Do you think it exists? Do you, take up with people, who make us feel sexier? And stay with them, because we feel desirable. Is there, one person, for us. And after they're gone. No matter what happens, or who else you sleep with you're alone. You know, like um... the goose, who stays with the flock but will never find another goose. You don't think, Daniel was my goose? No. Daniel's nobodies goose. He's a fully paid up, tool, that's a passing goose. And no matter, what happens. That's the way, he'll always be. What makes you say that? A woman knows. You have been waiting, to say that for years. Yeah. Hello! The mouth-watering aroma, of food being prepared. The soft glow, of candle light. The tempting sizzle of onions and garlic, and olive oil. What have you two, been doing? Letting the wine breath. You've drunk, the vodka. Sorry. No matter. I came prepared. A maestro at work. A little drink, for the maestro. Stop it. Let go of him. I have let go. Have not. I have, too. And now, for the master stroke. Ellen. The vodka. This is a dish, to reveal your soul. You sure about this? A toast to Ellen. To her first, dinner party. May it be the first, of many. Ellen! So Ellen. Are you going to move out of your flat? Leave all your memories. No. I'll stay here. Me and my sofa. Yeah. Seems like a great love. Ah. Love. A dangerous thing. ♪ Love is the Devil ♪ Have you ever thought, of buying a new pair of trousers, Stanley? I like my trousers. And they, like, me. Have you always been, faithful to Ronald, George? Of course. In thought, word and deed. They're lovely. Your thighs, look happy in them. They are happy. They're getting, happier. Have you always been, faithful to George, Ronald? Well. Indeed, maybe... But in thought, and word, I have not. My libido strayed, from time to time. I was always faithful, to Mr Boyle. As you were, to Daniel, Ellen. Yeah. Look what good it did her. Daniel and his cock, were out making new friends, every night. Leaving Ellen alone, with her sofa. At least, I didn't go out shagging anybody, who came by producing fatherless children. Bitch. That's not fair! George and I. Met in a pub, over a plate of, ham and cheese sandwiches. It was deliciously ordinary. That was years ago. Years, and years. We measured things, in feet and inches. Yards of material, flapping around our ankles. I would've been about, two. I don't think, I'd wish to know that. Those sandwiches, were pro baloney, and Parma ham. Thought very sheek in those days. I'm not ordinary! Never been, ordinary! I feel ill-ish. I'm going to die. I drank too much. All that food, that's sloshing around inside my stomach's not working. How much, have you had? God knows, how much vodka. At least, a bottle of wine. You should be, all right, on that. Just be sick, then you can start again. So that told him. Stanley? It amuses me. How any man, wearing a cashmere, stroke silk, roll neck. Costing the better part, of 200 Pound. Can call himself ordinary. Did it, really cost that? My shirt. Cost 15 Pounds on sale. Has it got, a really long tail. It's a beautiful thing. Waste of good money. Yes dear. Don't you dear me. Stop it, Cora. With what? Stop fiddling with Stanley. She fancies you. Ouch! Christ! Okay! Dear is what you say, to boring little wives. Which is exactly, what you've become. Better than being, a tart. She can't throw. You. When you have someone, you-- Yes. I'm a tart, and I love it. That's a precious colour. Pack that in! No! Won't! I won't leave Stanley either. Leave him, alone. I'm a tart, a beautiful tart. Stop it all of you. What's gotten into? I don't know what's gotten into you. Liquor! Gallons and gallons, of liquor. If only, Mr Boyle was here. God. I miss him. Is that why, you haven't shagged anyone for the past 30 years. She's pissed off, because Stanley fancies me, and she can't get Daniel out of her mind, and she should, because he's an ass. I know, Daniel wasn't a saint, but... I loved him. Aw. Come here. What makes you such an expert, on Daniel? I slept with him. Cora. I said it. I said, I slept with him. How? Well, easy. Very easy. He's a bastard. But a great shag, bastard. There's more. No, Cora. This is not the time. Cole's his son. You, cow. What was in that sauce? A bottle of vodka, at least. God. You knew, I always wanted to have, Daniels baby. You shit, Cora! You're to fucking uptight, to have a baby! You're too scared! I'm Ellen, I'm special and black Ms Superior. Mrs, actually! Unlike you, slag. Oh yes. Slag and proud. You couldn't even get your, slags badge and the brandings. Oh, fuck you! - Fuck you too! - Stop this! You must sort this out. Calmly. Fuck, calmly. Cora's a slag. There I said it. No she's not. She's been in hell about this, for years. So, you knew? She had to tell someone. She knew it would break your heart. Well, Cole. And you. You've all been laughing at me, behind my back. Nobodies been laughing at you. We've been, feeling sorry for you. Oh, Stanley. That's worse. I didn't mean it. It just happened. I'd just been cooped up, for months. Shit Ellen, I was horny. Look, I did not know who, he was. But Ellen. He sure as hell, knew who I was. You're a shit. You're a shit, and a liar. Get out. You're all shits! Why don't you all, get out! Go on! Laugh at me! Laugh at me. Ellen. Piss off! Piss off, all of you. Okay. I'll get my coat, and I'll go and piss off. I fucking, hate you. Yeah. I spent a bit of time, hating me too. I said, no good would come, of this party. I said, it would all come out. You were right. I said-- Daniel! Hi. How show you, dare your face around here. If I wasn't so passive, I'd punch your face! Come along, old man. Well, Stanley. You're the one, she's been goosing all evening. I vote. You go after her. Oh god. Cora! Cora, please. Thanks, for walking me home. Pleasure. Needed to air. Oh Stanley. I slept with Daniel. I know. Lucky Daniel. You don't think, I'm shit then? You always seemed, delectable to me. I wanted to tell her. I tried. On the tip of my tongue, then she would turn around and I can't decide. Then, she'd apologise... to me, for standing on her toe. How do you tell a woman, who goes around mumbling and sighing, and apologizing. That, you slept with her husband, and had his kid. I know, that I knew, but I didn't tell Ellen. She's not very good, at life. Dreaming, yes. Life, no. It's all right, Cora. No. It isn't. Thanks for saying, it is. Daniel. Is that you? You had a party, and you didn't invite me? Fuck off. Shut the door, on your way out. I thought, you were dead. I didn't. You disappear, out of my life. For years, I hear nothing. Not a letter, or a postcard, nothing. Oh, Ellen. I'm sorry. Piss off. You screwed, my best friend. She's had your baby. You've got a son. Cole. Cole? Is that what, she called him? Yes. Yes, and he is lovely. He's so sweet. Full of life. He should've been mine. I hate you. What are you doing? I was just, making you comfy. Stop it. Go away. Last night, you just fucked me, and then you tell me to leave. Looks like it. Sod this! There is, fucking nothing, in this fucking fridge. There's never, anything in this effing fridge. You eat it all. What you doing? What I'm doing. I'm kneeling on the floor with my head in the fridge. Searching for food, swearing like a trooper. What do you expect, I'm a mother. I'm sorry. I need to get away. Clear my head. Do some serious thinking. You can have, my Mars Bar. Aw, thanks. I know, what it means to you. Rachmaninoff. Dreary man. Are you all right? I'm fine. Don't worry Miss. We'll have you out in a minute. Get her out. Oh well. There you go. End of the fart mobile. But, I won't die. No. I refuse to die, to banana rama. "Hi. Ellen and Daniel here. Leave a message, bye". I know, you're there Ellen. And you're sulking. Well, stop it! Your dinner party, wasn't a disaster. It was memorable. Who, will ever forget it. Anyway. I have just the right, recipe, to aid in your recovery. Milk and Whiskey soup. Oh. There you are. What time do you call this? Have you any idea how worried we've been? We nearly, phoned around the hospitals. I know, you've got a good explanation? Oh my. The inquisition. Actually, the fart mobile, went off the road. Oh my god. Are you, all right? Of course. Look at me. Not a mark. The girl's in shock. Fetch Brandy. In this house, brandy? You'd be lucky to find a teabag. Not now, Ronald. Cora's, had a terrible experience. Really. I'm fine. Honestly. Actually, I need to go and pick up the shopping. Could you hang on, a little bit longer? You shouldn't be going anywhere. She's not as fine, as she thinks, she is. Someone's got to look, after that girl. Look at me. I won't let you down. Not a scratch. I'm perfect. I'll get you, some coco pops, to celebrate. "Sorry. And a thousand times, sorry for what happened at your party". "Please don't feel betrayed". "Nobody, wanted to cause you pain". "You'll always be, our favourite little blueberry muffin". "Love, Ronald and George". I was upside down. I couldn't move. It's okay, everyone. Oh my! Stanley! I nearly died. The car was upside down, and I was sitting in it, and I just got out, before it flattened. I don't want to be killed. I just realised it. I don't want to die. Yeah. Mortality is a bummer. All right. Hot sweet tea. You're in shock, I think. Unless you're daft, like this, all the time. No. Thanks, for saving me. Thanks, for bringing me here. I don't want to, go home. Wouldn't go, for a drink. Where else, is it? You have a nice, place here. You have, nice plants. I like them. You're so nice, Stanley. "Ellen's lovely. Ellen's talented. Ellen's witty. "Stanley's clever, kind, gorgeous kind, funny". "Everything a woman, wants in a man". "Thank Christ, we never shagged. "Now we can be pals, forever" What's happened to me? I can't move. Oh. Easy. Here. Properly up here, okay. Your mind, fell apart yesterday. Your body, just caught up. Stay, in bed. Oh, Stanley. You're a hero. Marry me. No, I don't want to get married. Adopt me. Can't clean the knickers already. Brought you some toast. And, have a look at this. I don't read, books like that. Anyway, I want to see Ellen. Look at the, pictures, in the book ♪ Lulu - Hey Stranger ♪ Ellen. Ellen. Listen, Ellen. I know you're in there. Come on. Open up. Oh for God's sake Ellen, we have to talk. Ellen! Piss off! No. No. I pissed off once, didn't work for me. Won't piss off again. Well, you going to have to. Ellen, please. No! Go away! Well, I am going away. I'm going home. What? Ellen. It's cold out here. If I wasn't all cried out, I'd cry for you. Please. You slept, with my Daniel. Oh listen, to you. My Daniel. Everybody's Daniel. Don't cheapen yourself, you're worth more. Besides, he said his name was Freddy. Freddy? Oh, for goodness sake. Stop standing out there, and being embarrassing. I suppose, you better come in. You know, Daniel was here, the other night. I know. I smacked his jaw. Good. You have to give, this man up. I know. I have. I told him, not to come back. It's over then? It's over. I was, I was all dandily. Should've just taken him, by the seam of his pants, and thrown him out. Talking of Emily. Look what Stanley found. Emily, and Rachmaninoff. Is it? It has to be. I looked at it, and I'm positive. Oh, It's true. She was telling the truth. I am going to have a wonderful life, when I go on tour. Yeah, that's love. I've got to dream, you know when you're older. I told you never to come back! Just a swift visit. We have come for the sofa. Leave that alone! Look, it's mine. I'm taking it. You gave me the sofa, on our wedding day, remember. Your one and only romantic gesture. You're not getting it. Ellen. You've got to get yourself a new life and a new sofa, to go with it. Think of it! A memory free sofa. Go. No! I won't! I've been happy on this sofa. What is happy, I ask myself Cora. What the fuck are you on about? Happiness. Oh, piss off! What do you know about happiness. More than you! Bastard! You're a shit! Who do you think you are, swearing at me like that? Who does she think she is? She's the mother of your child for one thing. She was up for it! If it wouldn't have been me it would've been someone else! That is a terrible thing to say. How dare you, speak to my best friend, like that. Seriously? Up for it? I didn't think. What about me? Yeah, what? Me, you fucker! Me! I am somebody! You wanted a fabulous Mrs Quinn. Someone, to drape on your arm, and fancy. Someone sexy! Someone who's tasted life. Blah blah blah. That is not me! That's not who I fucking was! Take it easy! You're going to burst something in a minute. I hate to say it, but he's right. I was fine the way I was! Fuck the fabulous Mrs Quinn! I hate her! Hate this sodding sofa! I don't want it, Cora. Push! And don't come back. I don't want to see you again. You and this sodding sofa. Oh, Dolly would be proud of you. Jolene. Jolene.

What will you do with it? Give half to you. I can't take it. Don't be silly. It's yours. I can't take it. It's yours. Come on. He owes you. Support for his son. Don't go all noble on me now.

More than heavenly. Upstairs. Ellen! I've been looking for you everywhere. All right. What have you done with it? With what, Daniel? I couldn't find my money. Where is it? I gave half to Cora. I took my Fiver back, and the rest is down at the bookies. I put it on a horse. You did what? I have made a bet. A punt. A wager. You know, that sort of thing. Oh, you haven't got on your lucky socks, and I didn't wear my lucky knickers, or my lucky bra. I didn't walk down, the lucky 7th Street. But... Here you are, anyway, look. 11995 Pounds, on Gangster's Revenge, to win. Oh no. What do you think? Fat chance, don't you think? Yeah. Fat chance. Oh, you're a bitch Ellen. Yeah, I know.
