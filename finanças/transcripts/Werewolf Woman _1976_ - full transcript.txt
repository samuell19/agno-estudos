And on the night of the full moon the howl of the werewolf will be heard. Its terrible cry will make men tremble. They will close their shutters and bolt their doors. Then the werewolf will begin searching for food, tearing to pieces whoever crosses its path. And when fully satisfied, it will go back in hiding in the depths of the woods. And if it finds a pack of real wolves, it will join them. Not until it is discovered and killed, not until after death will it regain its human appearance. What's happening? The Count's daughter, Daniela, has disappeared. But why are you armed? Where are you going to? - We heard the howls of a werewolf. - May the saints in heaven protect us. - We gotta get him! - But where has Daniela gone? We've gotta find her too. C'mon, hurry UP! Now you and your brothers, go down to the river. And all you others stay close together. We'll beat the woods up to Sales' caves! Let's go! Down there! C'mon! Daniela! What is it, darling? What's the matter? Answer me! Answer me, for God's sake! What is it, dear? Tell me... Answer me... Phone our doctor immediately and tell him to come right over. - Get her medicine! - Right away, sir. Darling... No doubt about it. Reading this ancient legend, but above all this extraordinary resemblance of your daughter Daniela with her ancestor, has made her abnormally obsessed with it. Did you know the story about this ancestor? We've talked about it around the house, but to us it was just a legend. We can't accept such ridiculous legends on werewolves, we'd be mad. Yeah, it would be ridiculous to think that anyone could turn into a wolf on the night of the plenilune and act like a beast committing animalistic and sexual acts of sadistic type. And yet lycanthropy exists. - Are you suggesting Daniela is a... - Please, be calm. The phenomenon has already been analysed, it was proven really. But considering that your daughter has never had manifestations of this kind before, that which occurred last night to be certain was determined after she'd read that old fable. And particularly when she found that her ancestor, the protagonist of this weird fable, had a remarkable resemblance to her. Tell me, Count, how did your daughter come into possession of that old chronicle? Daniela was 15 when she experienced the violence of a brute who raped her. The shock was tremendous. Physicians advised a change of environment. I thought this place in the country... would be ideal, our villa at Sales. In the chronicle I believe it says it was at Sales that your ancestor affected with lycanthropy was burned to death by some enraged peasants. That villa in Sales has belonged to my family for many centuries. I would never have made it my house, my home. When they advised I move out there with Daniela and Irene... - Irene? - My other daughter. She's in America now studying nuclear physics at Berkeley. A healthy girl, full of life. But Daniela has never been the same since she was raped by that maniac. She's always alone. She's obsessed with fear. She seems to be repelled by the opposite sex. Unfortunately, there was a fine young man who was in love with her but made advances to her too soon. She became quite hysterical and didn't want to see him anymore. No doubt it's a case of sexual phobia. So then, you made your decision to live in the country. Yes, that's right in Sales. And at a considerable sacrifice too for my business, my relations. The villa was filled with antique, dark furniture. So I transformed the whole place completely inside and out. I wanted everything to be modern and bright. Even had a swimming pool built and yet Daniela, especially since Irene went abroad, spends most of her time in the attic. She seems to be strangely fascinated, morbidly attracted to that old furniture. Apparently she discovered a secret drawer, where she found that miniature and the chronicles the old documents. Don't leave Daniela alone, if possible. You must look after and support her, and don't forget, you must always be near her. This therapy can be very helpful to her. But you never know what can happen. What do you mean? The strangest things can happen to a person in this state of mind. Well, the violence she experienced, this kind of attraction she bears for the past, the nightmares, those old papers she found in the attic, but above all her extraordinary resemblance to this old miniature constitute a progression of facts that are heterogeneous, the components of which can be sought in psychiatry and in a phenomenon of parapsychology. When science decides to contribute more time to the study of extrasensory phenomena, within 50 years it will make more progress than all men of culture have done throughout the centuries, and without being called visionaries, prophets... ...or even crazy. - How's my girl? - Oh!Wonderful! And then it's so wonderful for you to be here with me, to stay with me, keep me company. It just never happened like this before. It dawned on me all of a sudden the other day. I told myself: "You're an ass, a perfect idiot. Don't you see? Here you have sun, trees... And a daughter too! Well, of course, dear! That above all! Thank you. You know what I've been thinking? How about the two of us going ona trip for a while? Where would you like to go? To Greece, France, Mexico? Excuse me, sir. What is it, Augusta? There's a cable, sir. It's Irene! They're arriving tonight! Go and prepare the room for them and have Antonio get the car - and pick them up at the airport. - Very well, sir. That's the end of our vacation now. - Welcome home, ma'am. - Thanks. Hello, father! Well, you've given us a surprise! - Hello, Daniela! - Hello! Fabian, what are you waiting for? Come here! I'm so glad that you are here. I don't know if you intend to stay on but should you decide to stay here in Italy, I'm sure that I could be really be of great help. You see, the director of the nuclear centre happens to be an old buddy of mine. Oh, that's just great! Though it's not the right moment to make such a decision. In fact I have to finish my specialization. But it's not only what I decide, you see, there's Irene. Well, a parent always tries to keep his family close by if possible. Daniela! What's the matter? You haven't said a word this evening. Aren't you glad I'm here? You don't act like it. What are you saying? I'm happy. The news of your arrival today with your husband came all of a sudden and just knocked me out. We'll have along talk tomorrow. I've got a lot to tell you. I'm tired, now I'm going to bed. Say goodnight for me. Well... Now we'd better go to bed. Frankly I thought my sister would share my happiness in being here. Don't mind her, she hasn't been well. She's just a bit nervous, that's all. - Goodnight. - Goodnight then. Goodnight, father. Daniela! We're here! We're waiting for you. You belong to us. Come, Daniela, we're waiting! It's along time we've been waiting for you. You mustn't fear, Daniela. You belong to our world. Daniela, the magic circle has been formed. We've been waiting, waiting. Observe my wounds, see what they've done. - Did you hear that noise? - Yes. There must be someone outside. Yo're a good girl, Daniela. We've been expecting you, Daniela. You'll always belong to us, Daniela. Don't ever be afraid, I will help you. Fabian, come here. You see, I've been waiting for you. Don't be afraid, come here. Look at my body. Isn't it beautiful? I could make you feel things Irene never could. Go on, touch me, Fabian. I want you more than I've wanted any man. What's her condition now? Well, she's not recovering as we hoped for. It seems to be a state of nocturnal schizophasia. She's a hypermaniac, beset by phobic complexes. - Pressure? - The diastolic is a bit high. When did she have her last attack? She didn't sleep last night. She began to scream in a fit of psychomotor agitation. Her liver is a bit swollen and the abdominal muscles seemed knotted and hard. And the shock treatments? What results did you get? Pretty negative but the alpha waves on the electrode encephalogram are quite regular and symmetrical. - Electrocardiogram results? - In the norm. Just signs of myocardial alterations and extrasystolic arrythmia. In case of another attack, rather than pump her with drugs, it would be better to restrain her. She couldn't stand the drugs. Certainly in her condition, she's likely to have another attack. Do you suppose there may be a lesion of the brain? I rule out completely any lesion of the temporal lobe brain. Those large reddish splotches on her body are possible hematomas of a form of lupus sistemicus. How about administering a therapy with cortisone and tetracycline? No. Better to use narcosynthesis. Oh, what a surprise. Remember? You promised you come and visit me. Look. This breast is pretty nice, huh? Don't you admire a lovely breast? I'm not thinner, am I? Tell me it's not true. You'rejust kidding! This is a real woman. Oh, you are a real man. So cheeky. I'll invite you over tonight. You come and visit me. Look, don't waste time. - It's all clear. - Yes, you are right. - Let's check everything and... - Excuse me. Dr. Travel? He's on this floor,just about finished visiting his patients. Thank you. Irene, you go on ahead. Go to visit your sister. I want to speak to Dr. Travel for a moment. I'll go up then. Unfortunately, the neuroplegic treatment didn't give us the results we'd hoped for. Yes, but how are things really going on, doctor? These cases are not simple to cure. They're puzzling too. The symptoms your daughter presents are anomalous, contradictory. Usually this kind of illness manifests itself during puberty or adolescence. While Daniela is a grown woman. You're not telling me you haven't some cure for this illness, doctor? Surely there must exist some cure that will improve her condition. There are cases in which a patient behaves as if he doesn't want to get well. Sometimes it seems as if he wants to hide his illness. Unfortunately I believe this is the case with your daughter. It is clear that her personality has been shattered because of the influence of a violent neurotic charge. That which we learned about her ancestor is of great help. It's not only imperative to make sure her brain's energy isn't released due to tension the cause of which we don't really know. How terrible! I'd much prefer to delay my prognosis, but don't despair. Why did you come here? Why, just to visit you, Daniela. Before now I just couldn't. So please, forgive me. But since poor Fabian's death I lost all sense of... Fabian!You liked Fabian, didn't you? Sure you did! You liked making love with him. Daniela! What on earth are you saying? I saw you making love with Fabian! You were obscene! Disgusting! But you liked it! I like to make love too, you know. I wanted to make it with Fabian. I'd give him everything but you're the one who makes it with Fabian. I hate you! I hate you! You whore! You whore! Go fuck yourself! You dirty bitch! - Get away from me, you whore! - For God's sake, stop yelling! - I don't wanna see her face! - Stop it! That's enough! Can someone come and give me a hand? Easy! Quick! I can't hold her still, she's gone wild! Go away, madam! Quick, I can't hold her anymore! Be calm, quiet! Keep calm! Like this... - Do you want some water? - Yes, thank you. Please, nurse, untie me. Just for a little while. I can't stand it any longer. Please, I'm calm now. Don't be afraid. I'm not allowed to. Oh, please, untie me! - You have to calm yourself. - Oh, please, please! You'll make yourself worse, calm yourself. Try to sleep a little. Tomorrow you'll feel much better. You'll see, that's a good girl. Damn you!You whore! I kill you!You bitch! Hello, there! You're the girl who came here at the beginning of the month. I've been wanting to get to know you. My name is Josie. And yours? What a beautiful body you have. I knew you were so beautiful. You're so pretty... So nice... You didn't mean that. I'll forgive you. Do you want to get untied? Oh, yes, please. I can't stand it any longer. Please, untie me. Yes, darling, I'll untie you. Then we'll spend the night together. Are you happy now? Here are the keys, Dr. Savelli. I put everything in the car. Thanks, Renata. Oh, no! Help! Oh, God! It's time you go, darling. Aldo? Is it you, Aldo? Who's there? Don't be silly, Aldo. Is it you, Aldo? Who's there? Aldo? What is the autopsy report on this victim? According to the examinations made, the autopsy report says in all probability the victim's death was caused by massive haemorrhaging, with consequent hypovolemical shock. The lacerations and deep wounds are of uncertain origin. Almost animalistic. Uncertain. A bite of an animal? Look at these scars. Don't they remind you of something? No. In our profession one has to have a photographic memory. I remember having seen something similar. And so have you. Could be but I don't recall, sir. Try to remember. An ltalo-American, about a month ago, found in a ravine near the villa of that industrialist... Yes, in Sales... if I remember correctly. Yes, sir. That young fella who supposedly had gone out for a walk in the park and the watch dogs didn't know him. Yes, but that fella's wounds were caused by the protruding rocks of the precipice when he fell. Now these. Now what do you suppose caused these wounds? The hay? Well, perhaps a hungry dog before the local police found the cadaver. There are five different finger nail scratches. Distinct one from the other. They aren't scratches of an animal. You bring to mind a story that my old Grandmother used to tell. What story did your Grandmother tell? Fantastic tales of country people. It was something that happened when she was a little girl, in her village. The story of a man who on the nights of the full moon was transformed into a wolf. And he'd attack ferociously everyone who crossed his path. How about that? Oh, and then she'd say: "If anyone is born on Christmas Eve he will turn into a werewolf". I got a hunch that story of your Grandmother's wasn't exactly a fantasy. Let's go, Arrighi. Wait for me in the car. I have to phone the prosecutor. Good day. Inspector Modica, homicide. Inspector, sit down, won't you. Thank you. If you've come here to inform me of what occurred last night at the clinic, I've been notified early this morning. I don't know if you remember me, but we met about a month ago under unpleasant circumstances. I was investigating the unfortunate accident of your son-in-law who fell into a gulch trying to escape some watch dogs in tha park. Certainly, I recall, Inspector. My daughter Daniela, who saw that accident, was so shocked that we had to put her in that clinic where yesterday night... Unfortunately we have another victim. Was it Dr. Savelli? No, Dr. Savelli's in bad shape but the doctors hope to save her. Well, who is it? Early this morning, a few kilometres from the clinic, a body of a peasant girl was found outside her house. She was brutally murdered. I don't see how my daughter enters into this, Inspector. The signs of violence found on this young woman are identical with those of your son-in-law. At the time, it was thought they were caused by his fall and dog bites. I'm afraid Daniela's terribly ill. Incurably, Inspector. I understand and I'm very, very sorry and I hope that one day science will find the answer to your daughter's problem. But unfortunately I have a duty to perform. I have to find her before she can do anymore harm. It's evident that you suppose Daniela's come here seeking refuge with me. No, she is not! I assure you she isn't here. Look around for yourself. Interrogate whomever you like. Will you just go ahead and do your job, Inspector. I can assure you of my discretion. Excuse me. I knew it! I heard it all! My sister Daniela, she murdered Fabian. I will never forgive her, never! Did she take anything in place of these clothes? A skirt with various colours and a brown shirt. And they were new, you know! Not even worn yet! The dressmaker delivered them yesterday. Oh, and a pair of shoes, Inspector. Also new? Right? No! But they were in perfect condition! This woman, you said that you've seen her well? I'd just returned home from shopping and I saw her came out with my own blouse and skirt on! - Is that her? - That's her! Yes! Send out a bulletin to all stations and tell them to pick up this girl. She's wearing a brown blouse and a varied coloured skirt. Yes, sir. Ah, you already know this girl? Yeah, we got her in our files. Oh, yeah!Who is she? A little petty thief. Well, you've got to put her straight in prison. That's where she belongs. Just think entering into a house to steal. Come and frighten a person to death. Imagine the harm she can do! We'll do what we can. You can go now, ma'am. - But I want all my things, don't forget! - Sure, sure. - But when you find her you will arrest her? - Naturally. Now you go home and as soon as we find her we'll call you. Goodbye now. I consider myself very lucky, you know. Yes? How come? I would have had bad trouble if we hadn't met, you know. I simply had to get away. It was suffocating. There were always quarrels and fights. But I don't think these things interest you. Don't worry, just pour everything out. There are limits in life, understand? When you feel suffocated, you'll blow up in the end! Naturally, you blow up! My husband is very jealous, he was always abusing me. See what he did, my husband? When he gets mad he's worse than an animal. And look at this, look what he did to me. And there I've got bruises all over, you see? - Oh, come on... - You see I couldn't stay there. Look out! I was afraid, you know. Do you think you will go back to him? I'd be mad to go back to a man who gave me only pain, suffering and disappointments. What if your husband calls you and asks you to go back? I think he's happy I went away. Come on now, we're almost there. Look, you got any place to stay? No. Not really. No problem, if you stay with me, nobody will do you any harm. You know, I have a place of my own... It's a nice little house. No one comes there. I go there every now and again when... when I need to escape daily routine... If you like to come... That feels better. I've made myself comfortable. You should do the same as I do. You like someone to help you undress. You're right, honey, it's more exciting that way. Get your hands off me! Hey! What is this? Look, you don't think for a minute I fell for that story of the jealous husband with the hands, you ran away from home. You can't imagine what sad stories I here from cunts like you. Some of you bitches come out with the sob story about Mom at the hospital and the baby at the orphanage. Get out of here! Get out, do you hear? You're forgetting, baby, this is my house! Oh, I see you wanna play. Okay, I'll play that game. You'd like me to rape you. Come on! - You pig! - I'd like that. Come on, you big whore! I'm gonna rape you! - You'll see I can fuck you! - No! Come on! You Pig! - Very nice. - Can you play this game? No, I don't play, but I know the game. Too bad, we might have played a game together. Can't imagine how relaxing it could be, playing this game. Oh, yes. I can imagine. Very relaxing, it sure is. I believe you but I came here to speak to you about something else. Speak to me, I'm listening to you. It seems that your guess was right about that theory on Iycanthropy. I came to the same conclusion myself. Although I can't give any scientific explanations. But... how do you explain today's murder? Are you sure that Daniela is involved in it? No question about it. The description of the girl I got from the doorman was perfect. Varied coloured skirt, brown blouse and the identification of the photo. Listen to this. When Daniela was a teenager, she was raped by a brute. It was perfectly natural that the unfortunate incident should change her character. She's suffering from ancestral complexes, you see. Based on what? You must know that her relatives used to speak of what occurred two hundred years ago to the family. But they attributed the old tale to legend. But soon in our poor Daniela's mind it became a reality, supported by a portrait, she sees her own face in it. And she is convinced of reincarnation, that her ancestor and she are one and the same. Two hundred years later? We're all cells belonging to one immense entity that's universal and to us remains unknown. Seems we're surrounded by the occult. So occult were also the processes of reincarnation. A very interesting theory and somewhat fascinating. And logical. Think for a moment of the phenomenon of telepathy. And apparitions in those who dream. Those who are ill and recover through faith, for example. All this does not justify Daniela's behavior. I'm sure there is justification for it. We mustn't forget in a mind like Daniela's two important facts. Her conviction of her being the reincarnation of her ancestor, and her repulsion for the sex act. Now try to imagine what might happen when these two elements come together. Irene, Daniela's sister arrives from America, with her husband. Daniela is probably attracted to him but her sexual phobia predominates. There's a plenilune, a full moon night, and Daniela submits to its influence. When the spirit of a dead person penetrates somebody that's obsessed, the latter follows the destiny of that reincarnated spirit. And so then, Daniela starts with luring her brother in-law to exactly the same place where her ancestor was killed, understand? And possessed by lycanthropic fury, she kills her brother in-law. Her mind breaks down at this point. What happens? Disassociation, schizophrenia. I've had her under observation for over a month, I know this is the case with Daniela. Now the next plenilunez Daniela senses this mysterious summoning. So she kills that woman in the hospital to escape. Wait a minute. The autopsy on that peasant woman revealed that she had sexual relations minutes before her death. I believe it. No doubt she met with her friend and probably was making love. Daniela saw them, once again the two elements come together. So she kills. She begins to roam around aimlessly doing things which seem to be rational. As thieving of clothes... Finally she encounters that broken down Don Juan. While feigning to offer her protection, he convinces her to go to his apartment with him. Where again she experiences the same violence experienced as a teenager. Daniela rebels and so she kills her fourth victim. Hello, there! Buses don't run around here. Wanna a lift? You'll catch a cold staying there. There's a thunderstorm coming. Come on... Listen, my house is only a couple of kilometres up the road. If you like, I could put you up for the night. It's better than staying outside in this weather, right? That is a photo of the Loire Grand Prix. Do you have to do such dangerous work? Yes, ma'am. Always. Danger is my business. Stunt man. That's how I make my living. But at the moment I live in this Western village, an abandoned village. I do falls and hard jumps for lots of big stars. They're afraid. It's too risky. You can't imagine how many times I risked my life. I guess you've had some bad experiences with men. Well, you don't have to worry. I won't bother you. You go upstairs and I'll sleep here. Listen, the women I've had up to now, have always come to me of their own free will, understand? Daniela! Come here! Daniela, cut this, will you? Right here. That's it! When it comes to preparing these gadgets, I'd rather do it myself. I must be certain I'm not running any risks. I value my life very much. The more dangerous the work, the more I get paid. Daniela, it's a whole month you're here now. We seem to get along very well together. I've got some money put away. I'd like to take you away from this place. I saw a nice apartment. Once I'm done with this film, we'll move to our new house. You'll go and buy some furniture. Daniela, you haven't told me what you think about it. It isn't a bad idea, is it? - Hello? - Hi, Dad. Yes, Daniela. Daniela darling, where have you been? Now please, I can't tell you where I am. Please, listen to me. - Wait a minute, let me talk first. - Daniela! Father, let me tell you! This is important! First of all I ask forgiveness for what I've done to you and Irene. It was my illness, father, that made me do all those horrible despicable things. But now something's happened that's making me well again. Daniela, tell me where you are. I can't do it, dad. But I'm fine. I've never been so happy before. Hope I can see you soon. I've got to go now. - Don't hang up - I'll call again soon. Shut up! Hold your head down... What I've been telling you, guys? She's some piece, huh? Get out of here! Show us how you fuck! - You pig! - You bitch! Show us what you've got up here! Show us your tits! - You bitch! - Get out of here! Catch her quick! Come here! I'll pull her pants down. Go on! Give me a blow job! You lousy cunt! You dirty slut! Go on suck! Shut up. Daniela! Daniela! Stop it! Shut her up! Daniela? Daniela, where are you? Daniela, here she is! She came all over the place. Daniela... Go on, it's your turn. Morning, hello! Yeah, he's working. If you wait, I'll call him. Hang on,just a moment. Hello! Got a phone call! Alvaro! Hey, Alvaro! What the hell... Help: Help! Well? What's up, Arrighi? We searched that Luca Mondini's place. The kid that worked as stunt man for the cinema. He was found murdered stabbed to death in his house. Yeah, it was some kind of revenge, wasn't it? Obviously you didn't find anything interesting. Well, I found something... Alright, Arrighi, out with it. Know what I found there? Brown blouse and multicoloured skirt. What did you say? You heard it, and that's not the only information. You see, I checked around in the nearby neighbourhood, and you know what I found? An old lady at the market, one of those busybodies, you know the kind, told me that Luca Mondini was a nice boy, and that for a month before he died he was living with a beautiful blonde. So, I showed the woman that beautiful photo of Daniela. And she said: "Oh, my Lord! There's no doubt, that's the girl." Marvellous, Arrighi! Hello, Laurenti? Everything's right? Listen, I want to know to whom those fingerprints belong, the ones they found on that knife that killed that stuntman, you know, that Luca Mondini. Yeah, that's right. I'll wait. There's no question about it. There was a full moon the night that kid was murdered and I'm willing to bet my job that Daniela killed that kid too. Yes? They belong to a criminal? And he got killed the following night in that fire at the barn? Thank you, Laurenti. You can go home, Arrighi. Thank you, sir, but I've still got some work to do. It's a riddle! This woman disappears for a whole month and despite all our efforts nobody can find her. All of a sudden she calls her father and tells him that she's cured, that she's happy. But she can't tell him where she is. Now we find out she's been living with a young man who gets killed by a stranger. The same stranger gets burned to death in a fire. But we know he's a well known criminal, the friend of other two criminals who mysteriously disappear. We don't know where or how. I can't help it but in all of this I suspect only one person, Daniela. But where is she? Where can she be? I'm telling you, sir, this Daniela is going to drive us all to the nut house. Me too. What is this? The werewolf, the moon... I'm even afraid of sleeping at night. Since that story began, I have nightmares. The other night my wife told me I was yelling as if I was mad: "The forest of Sales, beware of the forest! The forest of Sales!" Did you say the forest of Sales? Turn on the headlights.
