What time is it? We must hurry, the light will turn off. I hate this light. Already? Massage my shoulders a little, I'm full of knots. Be serious. It's almost ten years since you've seen him. Go. Dad. Dad. Théodore! Huh? What's that? It's me, Félix. Who's that? Félix, your son. You don't recognize me? Yes, I recognize you. Caroline told me that we should talk... before you go. Go? Go where? I'm at home. You don't understand. That's not What I mean. Is someone coming to get me? No, Dad, nobody is coming to get you. Why are you calling me “Dad”? It's me, Félix. Who's that? Félix Saint-Francois, your son. My son. Coffee, please. I'll have a soup too, please. You know What? Bad news. My father's gonna die. Poor guy. Well. Beautiful. Mama. Mama. Could you stop that?

Like a big boy! What did you think I was doing to survive all this time? And the money I gave you, it wasn't enough? Not really, no. I have expensive tastes. How much did you sell them for? Six, seven thousand. It depended on the rug. You know he paid around 20,000 for them? What? I would have thought less than that. If I had known! Who did you sell them to? On Parc, not far from Villeneuve. The old lady paid cash. Cash! And Dad never realized? Did you ever see Dad vacuum? Never! So, What are you going to do with your half? Same thing as always.

You think it's easy for me to have to always justify your behavior? And Elisheva... Think about the shame that will come upon her... if you continue to act this Way. Is that really What you Want? To wreck our lives, mine, yours... our daughters. You know very well that I don't wish to wreck anyone's life. When will you finally understand that this is our life? - Hi. - Hi. Come in. Um- I brought you a little gift. Thanks. Can I? Mmm. Would it be possible to come in and listen to some music? Of course, come upstairs. He hated me to death. And then, he died. I'm sure he didn't hate you. Well, he didn't smile at me often. Why don't you have any children? Because I'm single. Why are you single? That's just the Way it is. There are lots of single people. With us it's the opposite. We have six, ten, sometimes fourteen children. Fourteen! What's it like to be single? It's peaceful. But it's hard sometimes. Often, even. Fourteen kids... WOW. I'd like to know What it's like. To be single. I mean like other people... You Want to know What it's like to be like other people? Get up. Come! Look. You look good. Hmm.

How old were you when you started drawing? When I was young I liked to draw. But then one day, I couldn't. When I became pregnant, I started again. Why do you draw? And you, why Venice? No reason. Why a cat? Why not? Now that I think of it, I never drew animals. Oh, no, why'? Why not? I began by drawing fruits... furniture, lamps, things like that. - Still lifes? - What? Hello? Ls somebody there? Felix, is that you? It's my sister. Caro! - What are you doing here? - I'm playing Ping-Pong. - With whom? - You, who are you with? - Honestly? - You don't introduce me?

I don't know What to say. It's my sister, I couldn't have known. Were you playing with me? No, no, I'm not playing with you. You lied to me! You said we'd be alone. Why are you doing this? Why did you lie? You know that's not true. I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry. I don't know What you're up to and believe me, I'd rather not know. Who told you there was something going on? I will come join you in Brooklyn when I decide to do so. It will give you time to think. Your cousin hates me. You'll see What it's like to be deprived of the little one. Out of the question. She's coming with me. She's staying here, I said. And at any rate, she doesn't have a passport. Who is this man? Who is this man? Who is this man? How was the sunset? It is beautiful at this time of year. It is not too cold up there? I'm a little chilly but it's ok. Children arrive soon. There are so many things to do, it'll warm you. How long will you be gone for? I don't know. I'm going to need your signature, if you Want part of the sale of the house. How much of the 35,000 do you have left? I don't know. I didn't count it. Do you remember when Mom Went on vacation in Costa Rica? Do you know why she stayed an extra two Weeks? No, why'? She had a lover. No... I'm telling you. Why are you telling me this? I don't know. I thought you'd be interested. The Woman you're seeing, she's married? She has children? And? What's the difference? I think Mom was looking for something a little exotic, for a change. She found her life with Dad too dull. You knew that before she got sick, she Wanted to get a divorce. It wasn't easy. You're not listening to me? Yeah, I'm listening. Stop Worrying, I'll be fine. Let's go? Well, yes. I'm scared. Wow! Wow. Amazing. Walk around a little, to see. It's tight. They'll fit. You have to break them in. Okay, now I'll tell the minds to calm down. Slow down a little. You're moving too fast. Little more calm. More relaxed. That might just be too fast. Hey, did you see that guy dancing? Well, I was not that surprised. To me, he doesn't dance so well. He's as bad as can be... and the girl? Well, for us, no... He can't compete with us. And you're a good dancer? Well, sometimes, yes... So, you have to teach him how to dance, because he's a terrible dancer! He has two left feet... These movements are not right... He dances like a vacuum cleaner, like we say in Spanish. I wish this night would never end. But I have to go. Mmm. Would you like tea? No. It's late. Are you sure? Thank you again for looking after her. Do you have any news of Malka? Oh. - Bye. - Bye. Bye-bye. The world is a cruel place my friend. What are you doing today? I'll get a gift for Elisheva. Good idea. You should go on Lee Avenue. The shops are great for children. And take your time... Enjoy the absence of your husband, until things fall into place. Ho! You! - Come here. - You're hitting me. Listen to me! If I see you near her one more time... Who- Who are you? Meira. Félix. You have no right to come here. Go. Félix. We mustn't forget the cardboard for the children either. We were short last time. If only I can remember everything, the messiah will come. So, Malka.

I would of course like to transform every obstacle... by means of elevation and supreme passion. Even in our greatness and our smallness... there are difficult paths we must take... to transform evil into good. And these difficulties, even the most terrible... only give more value to our commitment. The door was unlocked. Can we talk? Yeah. Sure. You Want to come upstairs? Have a seat. - Want some wine? - No. You sure? It's from my father's basement. It's kosher. That's okay. I need you to understand... that if Meira leaves me... shes also leaving the entire community. And shes probably never going to be able to come back. And my daughter's going to grow up Without a mother. I understand. If she does this... I need to not let my... feelings for her guide my actions. We're not friends. But I need to ask you a favor. Man to man. If she returns to you... I Want you to take very well care of her. And keep her safe and sound. 'Cause Without her, my life has no meaning. Did my wife-write that to you? No. I don't know. It's from my father. He died a couple of months ago. What-What did he say? I don't know. I didn't... read it. I- It was going straight to the garbage. That's nonsense. Can I read it? Yeah. Why not? “My son... I no longer have all my wits about me... and I am going to die soon. I am writing to apologize to you before it is too late. I am sorry for having bullied you... for having tried to force you... into the shackles of the family. I am sorry that we became lost to one another. I know that you never felt at ease in our family. You were apart from us... and you always Went your own way. I would have liked to hold onto you... but I didn't know how. I was not equal to the task. I ask for your pardon. Never forget that the blood that runs in your veins... is also the blood of my love. Your father, Théodore Saint-Francois.” ♪ Do-do-do ♪ - Shulem? - Hmm? Oh. She's beautiful in your arms.
