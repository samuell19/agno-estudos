Does she own that bank she was workin' in? You're not her kind and she's not yours. You need a real woman, Jeff, not a mouse. Look, shayne, now we've had that drink, so why don't you and your friends take off? Hi, buddy. Congratulations. I mean it, Jeff. Thanks, Edie. Well, see you around. But it's a custom to kiss the bride. My gosh almighty. You're not gonna go against a sacred age-old custom, now, are you? Well, no, but m-maybe later.

Looks like sister dear's going into one of her pouts. So? You didn't call me over here just to bug Edie. Remember our little talk we had today before we left? Yeah. Well, why don't we go somewhere nice and quiet and talk some more? [Connie giggling] [Splashing water] [Giggling] [Groans] [Growling] [Giggling] Woman, are you trying to start something? I'm not prone to argue. [Sighs] Why are you prone? Guess. [Sighs] [Birds chirping] Hey, what's the matter? Those people last night. Yeah. What about 'em? Are they going to be coming back? No. Uh, that was just their way of seeing US off. They play a little rough, but they don't mean any harm. Are you going to miss being with 'em? Sure. I'll miss Carl and some of the boys. What about the others? Like shayne. Not hardly. [Shayne] Now, ain't that a doggone shame? Did you hear that, lon? Uh-huh. He isn't even going to miss US. And after all we've been through together.

[Lon] Yeah, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to do just that, Jeff. Now get the hell out of here, all of you. Come on, shayne, let's go. Hold it. Take your garbage with you. [Man groans] [Moans] Oh, Jeff. Oh, Jeff, why-- why'd they do this? What's it all about? It's shayne's doing. What went on between you and her? Nothing, nothing, we went together for a while, and she got the wrong idea. Jeff? That's all there is to it, honey, so help me. [Engine revving] Where do you think you're going? [Man] We're going back to town. Ain't you comin'? Hell, no. The fun is just starting. Forget it. This is a drag. How about you two? What do you wanna do, Fran? [Snorts] Well, so long. Hey, lon, don't forget, you got to pay your entry fee by Wednesday. Right. Lon.yeah. Let's go. Lon. He run you off with that rifle. You gonna stand for that? We asked for it, shayne. Yeah, we was damn lucky he didn't start shooting at US, boy. Lon?yeah? Remember our little conversation last night? I sure do. You gonna forget about it, just like that? What's she talking about, lon? What's the use of staying around? I put Jeff in his place. You even got a chance to work over his girl. You put Jeff in his place? Yeah. [All laughing] Ah, go ahead and leave. You were always 2nd-prize money anyway. That's not true. [Shayne] Now, little sister, you know lon could never hold a candle to Jeff, bronc riding, calf roping. Don't listen to her, lon. [Shayne] You better run on back to town and pay your entry fee. Who knows? With Jeff gone, maybe you will make top man. Now, wait just a minute. I took Jeff in that fight and I can take him again. You just keep saying that and ignore the tail shivering between your legs. Drop it, shayne. Come on, lon. No, no, I think I'll stick around awhile. Jeff and me will have just one more go-around. How about you, spook? Well, hell, I'm stayin', I like to watch old Lonnie go. L.g.? Nothing like a good fight to keep things lively. Well, you know me, I just hang on with the crowd. Well, hell, let's go back and get him now. No, dum-dum. We'll wait till he's someplace where he can't get to that rifle. Just cool it for now, huh? Hey, buddy-buddy, where y'all off to? You following US, Jeff, doll? [Tires screeching] Hey. [L.g.] Hey, baby. [Banging on car] [Ululating] [Both laughing] [Tires screeching] [Tires screeching] [L.g.] Look at me, baby! [Engine revs powerfully] [Crashing] Hey, hey, l-- hey, l.G. Buddy-buddy? Hey. He's dead, isn't he? That rotten Jeff. Jeff didn't kill him. The trailer jackknifed. [Bea] It was an accident. We better call the police. No. No, we'll leave him here. Huh? Come on, we got to get those two. Well, come on. [Birds chirping] Now, listen, you want to get hung up with the cops and questions and be stuck here? L.g. Is dead, and we know who did it. It's no good, shayne. Well, little miss goody-goody. You really want to report this after what we've done today? Hey, you're a little quiet there. I'm sorry. It's just that i'm... Well, I'm still a little nervous. I was wondering why they left in such a hurry. Well, I guess they got tired of playing their little game. Don't worry. They're not going to bug US anymore. Tell you what. We'll drive a few more hours and then I'll find a nice, lonely place to camp. Ok? Yeah. [Gasps] [Spook] Ow! Oh, no! Oh! No! No! [Groaning] I'm ashamed for you, spook.Huh? I truly am. Well, hell, you seen her, Lonnie, she almost took my finger off. A little thing like her couldn't take off that much. [Gasping] [Chuckles] [Sniffles] See? Firm, but gentle. That's the only way, spook. That's the only way. [Chuckles] Yeah, I see what you mean. Hey, Connie! Hey, you're lettin' flies in. Connie? [Sobbing] Oh, Jeff. [Crying] Baby, baby, what happened? What did they do to you? Did those crummy bastards-- no, no. Oh, Jeff. Jeff, please, please, [sobbing] Take me away from here. Please, just take me away. [Crying] I will, baby. I will, I promise. [Connie continues sobbing] They took the rifle and box of shells. Oh, it doesn't matter, let them keep it, let them keep everything. Let's just get out of here, please. Please, Jeff. Jeff, it won't do any good. Let's leave here before they come back. Oh, please. Oh, Jeff. Please. Please. Ok, baby, ok. Let's go. Those rotten, lousy... [Rifle fires] Hey, buddy-buddy, where y'all off to? [Shayne] Just stay in the clearing, sweets, and nothing will happen. Shayne, this game's gone far enough. It's just beginnin', sweets. [Rifle firing] Jeff, don't. [Shayne] That's a no-no, Jeff, doll. [Chuckles] Well, I guess we'll just let them sweat awhile, huh? It looks like we're the ones gonna do a little sweatin'. We got plenty of beer, don't we? Hot damn! Party time. [Spook] Hey, now, y'all wait for me, you hear? [Lon chuckling] [All chattering] [Engine starting] [Siren wailing] [Police radio chattering] Well, now that we got 'em, what are we gonna do with 'em? Lon, you ever been to a snake house? A snake house? [Chuckling] No. I've been to a cat-- Jeff and I did. Went to one at the zoo. You know what they feed those snakes, lon? Let me think now. Little white mice. My, my! How about that, huh? How about that, Edie, girl? Hell, we stopped in front of that glass cage and there it was, this little white mouse. That little thing, he just scurried all over the place, but everywhere he turned there was this glass wall. That snake, he just took his own sweet time. He was playing the game of death, you see, and he was drawing it out, 'cause he already knew who was going to win. Finally, that mouse, he-- he got himself in a corner. He scratched at the glass and he squealed, but there was no way out. Then that snake slowly started uncoiling itself. Shayne. Jeff tried to pull me away but I wouldn't budge. Uh-uh. I had to see that game played out to the end. Ever seen a snake eat? He swallows his prey alive and whole, but not all at once, just a little at a time. He has to dislocate his jaw, so he can eat it. And that mouse, he just cries and squirms all the way down. [Shayne laughing] For god's sake, shayne, shut up. What's the matter, sis? Queasy stomach? [Shayne laughing] They were-- they were actually shooting at US. I can't believe it. It's so insane. Uh--uh... People don't go around doing that sort of thing. Do they, Jeff? I-It isn't real, is it? Honey... Jeff, do something. I want to get out of here. I'll get you out, don't worry. Now, Jeff. I want to go now. [Rifle firing] The next one will send you to the hospital, old buddy-buddy. [Rifle cocking] What was the shootin'? Oh, that old mouse was pawing at the glass. You didn't hurt him, did you? Oh, damn, that hits the spot. Nothing like a cold beer on a hot day. Lon, I asked you a question. Now, Shane, you don't think I'd do a thing like that, do you, and ruin all your fun? [Chuckles] Oh. Yes, sir. All I need now is a fine woman to lie beside me. [Chuckles softly] I'll go talk to Fran or bea. Well, if I'd wanted them, I'd ask for 'em by name. That's all right, they're not choosy. You're a cold-hearted woman, shayne. I'll thaw out later. [Squeals] Look what I got me. Oh, you... Give me that back now, spook, you hear? [Spook] Why don't you come get it? Oh, Edie. Come on, Edie. He's your problem. My, my, such a big fuss over such a little, tiny thing. [Laughing] Come on, Fran, I got him. I'm killed! [Groaning] Help! Come on, now! [Girls giggling] [Girls laughing] Shayne, let's knock it off and get back to town. What do you mean? I'm havin' a ball. Now, you don't like it, you get on your bike and go on home. You're a drag anyway. Shayne, give it up. He loves that girl. I know how you feel. It's all over between you two. He killed l.G., and that's not over. L.g. Got himself killed. You know that wasn't Jeff's fault. If it wasn't for her, l.G. Would still be alive. Look, somebody else is gonna get killed if this thing goes any further. Shayne, don't drag lon into this thing any deeper. Let's let lon make up his own mind, huh? When I was going with Jeff, I backed off so you could have him. I'm not going to do the same thing with lon. Backed off? Now, listen, sweets, I saw Jeff, I wanted him, and I got him. Now, if you're not woman enough to hang on to lon, don't go blamin' me. I'm getting out of here, and I'm going to take lon with me. Go ahead, sweets. Go right ahead. Why don't you do something instead of letting them walk all over US? For 2 days now you've let your friends push me around. No man would let that happen to his wife. If you love me, you'd help me. Me, me, me. Damn it, is that all you ever talk about? Now, look, I told you I'd get you out of here, so shut the hell up and leave me alone. [Gasping] [Fran and bea laughing] [Bottles clinking] Hi, Edie, girl, how's it goin'? Good enough. It's empty. Well, so it is. Let's you and me go down the road and get some more. Why? There's plenty more where that came from. Isn't there, girls? As long as old spook keeps away from it. Eh? Well, then let's go for a ride, just you and me. Nobody will miss US. They won't even know we're gone. You're tempting me. That's what I had in mind. [Shayne] Hey, lon. You know, I was just thinkin', doesn't this remind you of the time we all went out to dremont lake? Come on, lon. [Laughing] Yeah. Hey, remember the time old l.G. Got so drunk, he jumped off the end of the pier? He was all the way out to the middle of the lake before he remembered he couldn't even swim. Yeah. Yeah, me and spook had to jump in and swim all the way out there and bring him back ourselves. Yeah, old l.G., he sure was fun, he was always up to somethin'. I surely miss him. Don't you? Edie, honey, will you do me a big favor? What do you want, spook? Well, could you go get me a beer, 'cause I ain't supposed to leave here. I'll be glad to. Anything else? Uh, no. I mean, uh... Well, I don't know. What is it, spook? [Laughing] Come on now, now stop it. You're ticklin'. Spook. Why don't you put this thing down? It's only in the way. [Sighs] Oh, what's got into you, woman? I'm just funnin', spook, honey. Well, now, why don't we just, uh, see about this? Now, we-- hold it right there. [Stammering] Uh, now--now, what are you doin'? Now, come on, put that thing down, you gonna hurt somebody. I'm not funnin' anymore, spook. Shayne! [Spook] Shayne, come runnin'! Shayne, make her give me that rifle back. Edie, what are you doin'? I'm going to take this and give it back to Jeff and then I'm going to cut, and you better do the same thing. Lon, she's talkin' crazy. Now, Edie. Can't you see it's the only way? She's using you. She just wants them killed, don't you understand that? Lon. You better take that gun away from her before she hurts somebody. She's your sister. All right, let her go. Guess I was wrong. You weren't much of a friend to old l.G. After all. Shut up, shayne. Edie, I might have to take it. Lon, listen to me. I want that rifle, Edie, [sighing] And I'm going to take it. Now, come on. Come on, now. [Lon] Come on. [Gasping] [Edie sobs] Ok, ok. Ok. [Gasping] Lon. Fran! Bea! Get that rope out of lon's saddlebag and bring it here. You know, we can't trust her. No telling what fool thing she'll do next. Why don't you change out of that? Connie? I like brown, it's my favorite color. Once, on my 10th birthday, my parents took me to a fancy restaurant. I was the only child there. Connie. And--and the atmosphere was so sophisticated. And we sat at a candlelit table and--and the waiter even helped me with my chair. Oh, he--he was so tall and-- and so very elegant in his--his red and black uniform. But as he walked away, I saw that his socks were brown. Brown socks with black pants. The magic spell was broken. Is that you, Jeff? Are you like that waiter? [Sighing] What are you talkin' about? What are you really like? Underneath. Connie. How could you have ever been friends with them? And that shayne, you even went with her. Yes, but that has nothing to do with you. That was before. Did you love her? What kind of a question is that? Did you? No, no, I didn't love her. Then why did you go--let's drop it, huh? How was she, Jeff? Was she better than me? Stop it, Connie. How else am I supposed to find out if I don't ask questions? Ok. Ok, what do you want to know? That I rode with them for 5 years? Sure I did. Rodeo was my life, and I made money, damn good money, and I saved it so I could buy a half interest in that ranch. The one we're gonna live in, not shayne, but you and me. Now listen to me, damn it, does that tell you anything? Rodeo people are no different from any others. There's good ones, bad ones, just like in your fancy restaurant. And as for shayne, sure I slept with her, but I made no promises. We had a thing, it's over, and that's it. So don't try to make me feel ashamed when I got nothing to be ashamed of. [Sobbing] I'm sorry. It's just that I've never been in a situation like this before and I'm just so scared. I know. I know. Hey, I've never been in one quite like this myself. But don't worry, we'll get out if it. Hey. Come over here and help me with this, huh? [Birds chirping] [Frau and bea laughing] Spook! What? Come on up here and spell me awhile. But Lonnie, you ain't been there but 10 minutes. You hear me? Now don't you all be drinking up all that beer now, you hear? [Both giggling] Keep an eye on her, too. Well, now, where's she going, all hog-tied? Just do it. Them darn women. I just know they're going to drink up all that beer. [Fran and bea giggling] [Gasps] [Exhales] Works, hon. All right, a little more. [Fire hissing] That's enough. That's enough. Turn it off. Turn it off. [Footsteps approaching] [Edie] Jeff, let me in. It's Edie. This isn't a trick, Jeff. I'm alone. Let me in. You two gotta get out of here on foot, like, now. Why should we, now that I've got this? The whole bunch has flipped out. Shayne's got them believing you killed l.G. On purpose. L.g.? What are you talking about? He was accidentally run off the road by your trailer yesterday. He's dead. Oh, my god. Jeff, you can't just keep holding them off with that rifle. At least we got a chance in here. Out there, we wouldn't get a mile before they caught up with US on those bikes. How about if you had an hour or two's head start? How do you figure? This is kind of wild, but listen. I'll change into her clothes, then you two make it for the highway. I'll-- I'll walk around outside, and when they start coming down, I'll hold them off with the rifle. It's simple. Yeah. Yeah, well, what's gonna happen to you when you run out of shells and they come in here? What can they do? I don't know, Edie. It'll work. Knowing shayne, all she'll do is cuss and raise hell. And I can take care of myself. Come on, let's start changin'. You've gotta split before they know I'm gone. Ok. Edie, are you sure you'll be all right? Don't worry about me, buddy. Ok, buddy. Thanks. [Groaning] Shayne, honey, you've been teasing me long enough. Later, damn it. [Sighs] You know, maybe there's something to what Edie said after all. What do you mean? Maybe we're not hassling Jeff because of l.G. Maybe you've got some crazy notion that what we're doin' is gonna bring Jeff back to you. Lon, I think that beer's getting to you. Is it, now? I don't want Jeff back. I just wanna see him and that little bank teller crawl. That's all. Prove it. Satisfied? Not yet. Why don't we wait till this is all over? Didn't I promise you? Just like old times. How about a preview? [Lon grunts] Now, what'd you do that for? It's gonna be on my terms, not yours. Well, I ain't gonna wait any longer. [Grunts] I said on my terms, sweets. [Groans] Shayne, she's done gone. Shayne? Lonnie? [Spook] Edie's gone and she's got the rifle. What do you mean, gone? She was hog-tied. Yeah, but, uh, she... You damn dumb redneck. Come on, they're still there. Fran! Bea! [Connie panting] [Rifle fires] Oh, Jeff. Come on, honey. We gotta keep going. [Rifle firing] Come on. Let's go. Well, they got US. There's nothing we can do but wait. They gotta run out of shells soon. Damn it, we can't wait. Shayne, that's all we can do. Damn it. Shayne, don't you understand? They got US. Just do something instead of-- well, what do you want me to do? Throw rocks at 'em? Want me to throw another one, huh? Spook. Get ready for some runnin'. Where're you goin'? I'm gonna scare 'em out of there. What you up to, Lonnie? I got me a plan. Fran. Bea. Move around up there. Draw their fire. What, you out of your skull? You heard me. Do it. Come on, spook. Spook, start gathering up all them empties. Huh? Gather up all them empties. W-We're gonna throw bottles at 'em? That's exactly what we're gonna do. Now, go ahead. Let me have one of those bottles. Here. Mmm-hmm. [Chuckling] Yeah, that's gonna be more powerful than white lightning. [Rifle firing] [Rifle clicking] [Drawer opening] Look here, shayne. We got ourselves some molotov cocktails. [Sighs] Yeah. Lonnie, Lonnie, w-w-wait. Let me throw the first one. Uh, ok. Wowee, man, that shook 'em up. [Chuckling] Yeah. [Spook whooping] Light it. [Groans] [Spook] We got 'em, Lonnie. We got 'em, boy. We got 'em. [Screaming] Oh, man. Shayne. There's no sign of, uh, Jeff or Edie in there. That gutless little bitch probably hightailed it for home. [Spook] Shayne. She's still alive? Shayne, i-it weren't our fault. What the hell are you talkin' about? [Fire crackling] You better go with her, Lonnie. Huh? [Bea]Spook? We didn't know. We just didn't know. It was Edie. Shayne? [Grunts] You killed her! Damn you, you killed her! You killed Edie, you dumb son of a bitch! You killed her! Shayne, I didn't mean to. I didn't mean to. I didn't know the trailer was going to explode. [Sobbing] Look at her. Look! Look at the clothes she was wearing. And that scarf. From that distance, you didn't even know who she was. Let's go. Come on. We gotta get those two. What is this? You all comin' or not? Well, sure spook's comin'. Ain't you, buddy-buddy? No, Lonnie, I ain't goin'. What the hell? Of course you are. You damn dumb red-- all right, I might be a damn dumb redneck, but I ain't no killer. What is this anyhow? We was going on a party, and now two of US is dead and y'all planning on making two more dead? Shut up. Get on that damn bike. All right, go ahead. Come on. W-W-Whup me. It ain't gonna change nothin'. Now you two just ride right on out of here. And me and the girls ain't gonna tell on nobody. But don't neither one of you ever come around US again. To hell with them. We're wastin' time. [Motorcycle engines starting] Hey, hey, don't quit on me now. It's no use. There's not a soul in sight. [Panting] Hey! Hey, stop! Jeff, watch out! [Panting] They wouldn't stop. Why wouldn't they stop? Why wouldn't they stop? Honey, honey, it's gonna be all right. Honey, there's bound to be a farmhouse or somethin' around here. Why, I bet right around the bend. Jeff, please.
