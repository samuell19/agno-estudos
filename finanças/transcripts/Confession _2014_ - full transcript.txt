JI SUNG and ran down the mountain, he suddenly fell. JOO JI-HOON So I got right up and carried your dad down. LEE GWANG-SOO After running a while, I found Uncle In-chul fallen, too. So what did I do? I carried them on each shoulder... ran down the mountain, and straight to the hospital. Written & directed by LEE DO-YUN I'm awesome, huh? Not again, Uncle Min-su. That's not what Uncle In-chul said. He's wrong! In-chul, that bast... He's the one who's lying. You think I'm lying? Yes! Tickle, tickle, tickle! Tickle! Tickle! I got you! - Mom says to come out. - Okay. Airplane! Let's fly out! Happy birthday Yuri! Kiss! All your favorite food is here! Sit here. Happy birthday Yuri! Happy birthday! Where's Uncle In-chul? Mother! Ow! My back! Let go! You never know what can go wrong in life. It scares me every time I go to your arcade. It's packed with people smoking like crazy. Okay, I get it. Bring the insurance papers and stop by tomorrow morning. Tomorrow? - Yes, ma'am! - Wait. It's my new number. I already know why give me this... Oh, right. - Bye son. - Take care! Have a great day! Yuri? I'll scold Uncle In-chul when he comes. Let's eat. He's here! Uncle In-chul's here. - Why you... - Fool! Move! Daddy's here! - A bicycle! - Yuri! Lucky you! The best bike there is! Nice, huh? - Hi, Yuri! - Thank you! Careful! Always so thoughtful... I finished all the food from last time. She says to eat it with rice not beer. I only drink a bit to ease the food down. Instead of water. He says he doesn't drink. Just a bit instead of water. Yeah right! Stop drinking, pal! I'm beat! Let's rest. What's this? A four-leaf clover? Did you make this? You never take food Uncle In-chul, so take that. I got lots of money to buy my own food. Only bums like Min-su take food home. Don't play with kids like that. Hey! What's that? None of your business! What about mine, Yuri? I'll make yours next time, Uncle Min-su. Yuri! Come here you! Let's run away! Come back here! Go! Go! In the thick smoke all dressed up I am lost in the passing time - Bastards! - You butted in! Bastard! Come here you! Damn young bastards! - Why live getting beat up? - We won. Don't worry. - You deserved it. - It's okay. Go to sleep. Every time he gets drunk! Stupid fool. - Let's go. - Why live? Look. The fool's sleeping sitting up. - Lie down Min-su. - Go! I took your parents to the hospital today. Dad can walk now. - I'm drunk. Let's go. - Hey! Be good, bastard. Mother got a new number. Why must I deliver your mom's number to you? I'm no slave. If I were you, I'd be nice to my rich parents and live it up! How are your parents? Do you call them often? Why call the old bags who left hating Korea? Come on. Be good! Wait. Your mom said to give you this, too. Screw you! See ya. Hey! I'll give you a ride. - No thanks! - Watch it! Damn firefighter with no sense of civic duty. See ya! Hell! You scared me! You're home? Shit. I told you not to come when I'm not here. I came to get away from some stupid bastard. Whatever! Don't smoke in there! Just close the door. Why come home so late? I was working. Why don't you clean up the damn mess around here? I'll do it later when I feel like it. When you clean... don't touch important files and throw 'em out! Okay! I said I'll clean. The homeowner came by. He yelled like hell for not paying rent. Shit! Stupid! You opened the door again? Just move to a cheap place around our shop. Crazy? I can't live in hell holes like that! Shit. Wanna do it? - Bring the cutter! - Okay! Get the injured out! Slowly! That's it! What happened last night? I feel like a beat up punch bag. It's cuz you get drunk and sleep sitting up. Aren't you late? Who cares if I'm late? What can they do? Hurry up and stay out of trouble. I need a drink for my hangover. Take care! VICTORY ARCADE Welcome, sir! Hello, sir. - Is she in? - One moment. - Have a drink. - Thanks. She says to come in. I'll see myself out. Take care. - Mother! - You came? Mother, you look even younger than yesterday! Why you. I met Hyun-tae last night. Don't bring up that jerk. Come on, Mother. Still Hyun-tae talks about you two a lot. Then, why go against us and live a stupid life like that? Marrying that damn orphan bitch. Let's see it. - This is totally perfect. - Let's see. Read it through. I made this especially for you. Whatever! How much if this place burns? 10 million! Fill it out. I'll sign. Here. Smoke one. Thanks. Here. Will this deal pay for your bills this month? Not even close. How about you? Business seems a bit slow today. I can't do this gig for long either. Damn. Business isn't as good. With Hyun-tae's father sick... damn bastards hound me for money left and right. At midnight this Sunday after closing... I have a big payment to make. It'd be great if someone comes then and burns this! So I can retire on the insurance. No matter how hard I try to run it alone... Why'd I put surveillance cams all over here? So stupid. On the contrary... with evidence on the cams, it'd be easy to get a settlement. Really? Oh! I wish I could live comfortably. Who can help me? How about a game? Number 52 is looking good. Congratulations, sir! FAKE PATIENT 17 I just went out for chicken and beer. Why didn't you go in the wheelchair! Shit. Was the chicken good? The patient went to replenish nutrition. What's so wrong with that? A patient with a broken leg went out without even crutches. That's not normal. Chief SHIN? When will you get off my back? To all the 6 fake patients in this room... You'll no longer receive recovery payments. Disciplinary will call you. Take care. The fuck... Get up! Why'd you drink so much? What's wrong? Min-su? What? Aren't you getting married? Your dick will rot. Bastard! What the hell? It's not cuz I don't want to. How can I with no girl? Min-su? What's with you today? About Hyun-tae's mom's arcade... I met with her today. Is she doing well? The arcade... Let's rob it for her. What? She asked me to do it. Think about it. Hyun-tae's dad got sick. But she's too busy to take care of him. And you know Hyun-tae's uptight. As long as she runs it, he'll never go see her. They're family! How sad is that? If we help her this once... know what the best part is? No one loses, pal! She can retire on the insurance and make up with Hyun-tae. And you'll get a cut to get married and shit! Huh, Min-su? Isn't it great? I'm going to bed. Come in to sleep or go. Sit down! You fool! How long will you live like this? How long do I have to take care of you? Please don't. The hell! You fool... Please don't what! Who're you to stop everyone from being happy! Just don't. Let's sleep. We gotta head out early. Damn! Selfish loser. Who is it? In-chul's car is here. - He slept over? - Yup. Did you drink? Told you not to eat it with drinks! MUTE No luck? It won't come off. I have leftover detergents, but it'll ruin it. I don't know why they're at it again. It's not Yuri's fault Mi-lan is like that. It's not contagious! Why'd In-chul come? Is something wrong? Something happened at a delivery place. But In-chul took care of it. In-chul seems to do quite a lot for you. Like hell! It's what friends do. - What friends? - Don't hit him! You came? Aren't you cold? Dang! It's cold! Give me that. Damn young fools who don't know any better! Throw it out! I'll buy her a new one. It's the 29th, right? What? Your parents' anniversary of passing. Oh, right. You son of a bitch. Be good to your parents like everyone else. Why don't you? Stupid. I want to be good to them and live normally. But they don't live like that. Exactly! If they lived normally, Hyun-tae would be happy! Right? The hell. I gotta go. I'll come that day. - Throw that out. - Okay. Take care! Bye. What? What? What? What? Let's eat. Come in. I'll cook.

Mother... Mother? Mother! What the hell... Mother? Oh no... Oh no... How did this happen? Mother... What do we do? What do we do? Hey! Wait! Fuck! What's this? What's the address? A basement arcade at Dal-san 6-1. Where? Take the mask off. What the fuck! I didn't plan for that! Bastard! Take it off! Son of a bitch! Go to bed. I'll come tomorrow. That son of a bitch! Hey! You bastard! Stupid! It's not my fault! What did I do wrong! What the hell did I do! You son of a bitch! It's not my fault! Stupid! Bastard! FUNERAL HOME Uncle... Min-su's pretty shaken up. Think it's in there? It has to be or else we're screwed. Move it along! Don't take all day! Damn it. Sir? Working hard? How've you been? You're on this case? Help me out, Detective CHOI. It's still not opened? What's taking so damn long? What the hell! Shit. What? You're on this? The Chief of Police is here? I'll come by the station soon. Take care. Mrs. LIM's son, Hyun-tae, is the culprit. You know JUNG In-chul who's under disciplinary? They're inseparable friends. CLOSE FRIENDS A hefty fire insurance on Victory Arcade... was signed by JUNG and Mrs. LIM 5 days before. Then, it's so obvious. What do the cops say? The Chief of Police was at the scene. Cooperative investigation is out. First, find out if JUNG and LIM had alibis that night. Yes, sir. One of the surveillance cams can be restored, sir. - Really? - Yes. - See if there's anything on it. - Yes, sir. Come with me! - Honey! - Let's go! Hey! The hell? I didn't even wash up. What'd you do on the 24th? The 24th? Sunday! Were you working that night? I don't remember. Shit! It was 4 days ago! Why can't you remember! I can't even remember what I did yesterday. Then, you were with me that night. If anyone asks, tell them that! Got it? Was 1? Okay. But who'll ask me? Fuck! Just do as I say! Why are you yelling! Fine! What's with your face? Are you sick? Shit! Let's go home. I'll make chicken soup. Fuck that! Get off! - Get off? - Yeah! - Get off! - Hey! Honey! - Shit! - Hey! What are you doing? What the hell! I'm going to Seoul. The hell... If you disappear now, you'll look most suspicious! Who cares! Fuck. Come here and listen to me. Come here now! What! I'm not listening to you! Fuck! Look what it got me! Fine. We'll go to Seoul. Screw you, bastard! Shit. Didn't your mother mention me? Look. I have shares in the arcade. So, I looked into things. Things are pretty bad. Your mother paid bribes to cops and prosecutors. But her ledger went missing. - So? - Well.. What I'm saying is... the police won't look for the culprit. But then that puts me in a rough spot. It's an IOU. Your mother borrowed big money from me. What do you want from me? The culprit has to be caught. Then, you'll get the insurance settlement. Then, you can pay me back. - I'll see you in court later. - Wait! Sit down, please. No need to get excited. We can work it out between us. Fine. I'll look into it and see you later. Aren't you mad? Don't you want to catch who did this to your parents? How can a son not want to? Did I push him too hard? You think? Mr. LIM Hyun-tae? Special investigations from Life Insurance Company. LIFE INSURANCE CO. SHIN YI-SU Why are you here? Just stopped by. Do you have time to chat? I'm listening. I'll say it straight out. We're postponing the insurance payment. From our standpoint... we need the police reports... to see if the payment should be made or not. But there's no progress in the investigation. And personally, I don't think it was an accident. That's all you came to say? Insurance settlement worth... $20 million. I thought, who'd benefit the most from this case. Obviously you came to mind. Someone died. My mom died! Why's everyone just talking about money? Isn't there anything else to talk about besides money? Just go. HYUN-TAE Hi, Hyun-tae. That's enough. You've been through a lot. Still, we should do this. Min-su, bow to your parents. A few years back... Someone snuck in and took Yuri while Mi-lan wasn't watching. I asked around. A neighbor said she saw someone take Yuri off in a car. From her description, I realized it was Mom. So, Mi-lan and I went to her house. Mom was blankly watching Yuri on a table. Yuri was crying like hell. So, I yelled 'What are you doing'! But she said she didn't know. Dad fell ill a few days before that. She must've been scared. With Yuri gone, she thought I'd leave Mi-lan and come home. In-chul. Min-su. Yeah? I gotta catch the culprits. What are you saying? She's my mom. She didn't know to live better, but she's my mom. No one's trying to find her killer. When my mom died! Hyun-tae... Calm down, man. What can you do, pal? I'll catch the bastards. And make sure they pay. It's only right. Min-su? In-chul? Help me, pals. PAYMENT POSTPONED FOR LIM HYUN-TAE - Fuck. - Chief? What? Someone's here for you. Confess? If you can't... I'll say I did it alone. In-chul... Think about what will happen if you confess. Min-su. If we confess now... Hyun-tae will find out everything! Are you okay with that? Huh? It's killing me, too. But think about it. If we go weak now... it won't be just you and me. We'll drag Hyun-tae down to hell, too! What about Mi-lan and Yuri? He wants to catch the culprits, not find out we did it! Min-su... Let's not go weak. Okay? Who's that bastard? Let's go eat. Shit! Go home for now. Why? Just go! Hurry! I'll call you. Min-su! Got it? Shit. Damn old jerk. What are you doing? You're behind Victory Arcade, aren't you? Why are your cases always so suspicious? What the fuck! What are you trying to say? Just frustrated that's all. I think it's an inside job. If you're gonna talk nonsense, I'm leaving. One of the surveillance cams was restored. Wonder what's on it. But it's useless shit cuz cops won't investigate. Know why? I don't care! Get out of the way. Move! Get out! Her ledger is missing. The record of all her bribes to the cops! I wonder who has it. Probably the culprit. The weirdest thing was... the door was open. How'd they know to come then? Everyone knows we're closed on Sundays. But payday always changes. We don't even know. Notice anyone suspicious come before then? Lots of people come and go. Sorry. Bro! Aren't you playing? - Thanks anyway. - Sure. I'm sorry about Mrs. LIM. She was really nice to me. Mr. JUNG In-chul? Police. You know Mrs. LIM, the owner of Victory Arcade? She's my friend's mom. Why? Can we go in to talk? What? Why? We can talk out here. Is there something inside? No! It's just a normal house. Open it. Let's have a look. Back off! Are you really cops? Where's the warrant? What warrant? We just wanna go inside and talk for a sec. What's with you people? Just go! - It won't take long. - Hey! - Stay put! - Let go! Who's he? Wasn't the insurance guy her son? - Maybe they're brothers. - You think? Her son? He came by sometimes to the store. Mrs. LIM called him 'son'. He came by two days before the fire. Wasn't it a few days more? FOUND THE CULPRIT Bring him in. Go in. Go on! Okay! Oh man. We made a mistake. You're not mad, are you? Hope you understand. Stop by the station tomorrow. Sure. - Call before you come. - Okay. Sorry. Shit! Where'd it go? Where is it? CHICKEN SOUP The hell! That bitch! Looks like they're your mom's bonds and jewelry. Someone called to ask about exchanging them for cash. Where? Hurry over. Don't be late. - Ji-hyang isn't here! - Back off! Bastard! Hey! Where's the bitch? - Where is she! - What's it to you? What? Who are you? I'm your fucking nightmare! Where the hell is she! - You find her! - You fucking bitch. Fuck! Hey, Mister. What? There's a place to exchange jewelry for cash. She asked me for the number, then left. How about the arcade and insurance... in exchange for this IOU? I think it's the best thing for everyone now. Where are you? I found the culprit. Let's go. Bring your car! Where? Hey! Shit! He's lost it. He's running around like crazy. Stay close on his tail. He's the culprit. Mi-lan... No... I... I gotta go. I have to go... Sorry... No idea what you're saying. Mi-lan... Should I learn sign language? SHE'S CARRYING A RED BACKPACK - There! It's her! - Huh? Hyun-tae! Shit! Fuck! Help me! Stop yelling. - Quiet or you're dead. - Okay. In-chul! Honey! Wait! - Shut up! - Sorry. Shut up! Where's the ledger! Where's the damn ledger! Here! It's right here! Why'd you take this! - I thought it was important. - Bitch! Why isn't he answering! In-chul! Just go. I can go? Get lost! So, it's over between us? Fuck you, bitch! - Why are you coming from there? - Huh? Did you see the girl? You didn't either? Damn! Fine. Check that way. I'll go this way. Hey, wait! Here. Drink this. I heard you went there before Mom died. Yeah... I told you I met her when I gave you her card. How'd you know about the girl? Did the cops tell you? RYU, a guy mom used to deal with, told me. Really? What a fuckin' nice guy. He told me in exchange for the insurance payment. What? Hey! Why the hell did you do that! You stupid! Fuck! Shit... Yes? Okay. Thank you. - Stupid fool. - Let's go. Where? Dad gained consciousness. This isn't a store. There's one down the road. Mr. KIM Min-su? You're KIM Min-su, right? Who are you? An insurance investigator. I have a few questions. You're friends with LIM Hyun-tae and JUNG In-chul? - Yes. - Know about Victory Arcade? The place LIM's mother ran? Between 9 PM and midnight on November 24th... Where were you? What? Where were you that night? Don't remember? No. Your head... How did you hurt it? Just go. I got nothing to say. Really? Mr. KIM? You know? Rather than a stranger... the probability of getting killed by someone close is higher. Getting killed by a son or a friend... is much higher than being stabbed by a stranger. Scary world, isn't it? After killing someone so brutally... they live on as usual as friends and such. See you again. Are you okay? His vocal cords are damaged from the smoke. Do you have paper for him to write on? - The chart. - Here. Dad? Write what you want to say. MOM Mom is... getting treated. That's enough for today. Seizure! Take his son out now! - Father! - Breathe slowly. - Stay out, please. - Hurry! Bring the respirator! Breathe slowly. - Wait outside. - Breathe in. Respirator! Hurry! Slowly. That's good. Where is it! He may not be able to come out of his coma. Are you going to stay? I gotta go and take care of something. In-chul... Nothing... Go. CASE FILE Don't break the deal. If things go wrong, I'll squeal everything. I'm curious... You happy this happened? Cut the nonsense. Have a drink. In the thick smoke all dressed up MESSAGE FROM MIN-SU I'M SORRY HYUN-TAE CALLING MIN-SU Please leave a message after the beep. Hello? Min-su! You bastard! It's all over, man! I cleared it all up! I did! I saved your life again! You bastard! Got that! Damn it! Message saved. Got that, Min-su? Min-su! TO HYUN-TAE, IN-CHUL You son of a bitch... VICTORY ARCADE ARSONIST KIM MIN-SU COMMIT SUICIDE. CASE CLOSED. KIM Min-su didn't do it alone. Here. It's the insurance policy JUNG made with your mom. KIM Min-su probably took part... Hey. This was in Min-su's pocket. He died after meeting you. Leave us to deal with it ourselves. I'll get to the point. I want Hyun-tae's agreement. Hand it over. Have a drink. Fuck! Give me the agreement on Victory Arcade! Hand it over! You son of a bitch! I got it fair and square. Why? Fair? I know about Mrs. LIM's IOU! It's all in her ledger. She basically paid you all back! So? So? Fuck! I can prove it's all illegal! You sucked up way more than what she owed, so let it go! Okay, fine. But... If you act up again, I'll kill you. Ask me politely. Why do you want it? Well... My friend has to inherit it, sir. Please give it back. But I'm curious. Why is her ledger in your hands? It went missing when she died, but now it's here? What does that mean? Fine! I killed her! I killed Hyun-tae's mom and took it! So what! Fuck! What if I don't give it to you? You'll try stabbing away here? Killing again is easy. Is that it? Hell, yeah! Try and kill me you bastard! Try it! Asshole! Fuck! Bastards! Give it to me! Give me the fucking agreement! LOAN SHARK Hello, Mr. LIM? Uncle In-chul! Hey. Why don't you ever come by? And Uncle Min-su doesn't call. Did you fight with Dad? Of course not. What's wrong? Are you sick? How've you been? Going somewhere? Hyun-tae... In-chul... Yeah? For 17 years... I've wanted to ask you. Back in middle school... Up on that mountain... You went down alone and brought help. After you left... I carried Min-su out in the snow and got discovered. Know why I did that? Probably cuz you were scared. After you left, I packed Min-su's bag... and saw his Walkman missing. I wondered why you'd take a Walkman with dead batteries. I suddenly thought you might not come back. - Why would I leave you two... - I don't get it either. But back then... I really thought you won't return to us. When I thought you abandoned us there... Know what came to mind? I should leave Min-su and run, too. Since you did it, it'd be okay for me, too. Really? For the last 20 years... That's how you felt about me? Must've been hard on you. Got anything to tell me? Have a good life. Take good care of Yuri. Min-su wrote it. There's a note for you, too. Goodbye. Thanks. What? Thank you. WITH ME GONE, MAYBE YOU TWO CAN MAKE UP BE GOOD TO HYUN-TAE FOR ME THANKS FOR EVERYTHING, PALS I'M SORRY
