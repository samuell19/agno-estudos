Whole cavalry's here. I don't get it. She knew what would happen. All right. Let's do this. First on site? Already been handled. This is out of control. Get the body to the morgue. Trash the jeep. It's not my job. Do it, Leiland. This is all on you. Are you good? Time to make a call. Under the stars, Arthur boy! My chem-trail guy confirmed our suspicions about White Sands and Alamogordo and that observatory that the FBI tore down, that is definitely Big Brother related. Uh, we will dig into it later. Okay. Arthur, these type of days are the worst kind. We're gonna get you through it, pal. So let's get busy. A lot of setup to do today before the big show under the stars. Do not panic. I repeat, do not panic. I repeat, do not panic. I repeat, do not panic. Hey, hey, hey, Junctioneers. Welcome back to The Thought Junction, the deep web podcast dedicated entirely to all things conspiracy. I am your host, Wild Horse, here with my co-anchor, Atlas Major, our resident private investigator. Howdy, howdy. You know the drill, people. You wanna talk, our burner's up. Number's on the site. Well, Wild Horse, this week we continue discussing the unsettling number of Illuminati black operations that plague our country. With the common goal of stealing our basic civil liberties. Mark my words, MK-ULTRA never stopped, people. There are human testing facilities strewn all across this country. Some are hidden in plain sight, others in tunnels, bunkers, right under our feet. That's a friendly reminder of how our overlords value us. None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free. And for all of us out there blowing the whistle on these characters, there's only a few ways this can possibly end: - Pawn, patsy or dead. - Pawn, patsy or dead. Oh, we got a caller. Uh, who are we talking to? - My question is for Atlas. - Shoot. I know you worked in homicide. - Do you still do murders? - I'm retired. Retired? More like pulled off the case because you saw something you shouldn't. Hey... I don't know what I saw. Why, what's going on? My daughter, she was killed, I think. If that's true, go to the cops. They're in on it. And they're covering it up. All right, sport, where are you right now, ma'am? No, this was a mistake. I'll, uh... Don't... Just don't go anywhere... All right, let's go to the forum boards, Junctioneers, see what's trending. I am powerful. I am protected. All right, Chucky, go on. There he is, Charlie. How's that bum knee, George? Do it, George. Drop the limp. Nobody's watching. Mm-hmm. Boom. Hmm, you got a knack, Arthur. You got George. Up to your insurance boys' standards? Yes, thank you. Thank you. - How's Tanya? - Ugh, don't ask. You haven't been going to your appointments. That's because sometimes I can't tell who's the doc and who's not. - Guy's a whack job. - You wanna get better? You gotta go to your appointments. I'm just looking out for you. I just... I'm grown up, Shell. How about you and Nick? Mr. Tall, Dark and FBI. - Why can't you just be happy for me? - I'm looking out for you. - You're looking out for me? - You don't think it's at all coincidental that he just happened to be transferred into town and to go out with you? You're going too far with this conspiracy thing. - And you know what? I blame Jimmy. - At least he believes me. You met him in 5150. He's a crazy person. I mean he gets in your head, he provokes you... Whoa, hey, gee, Shell. Don't hold back. My only friend. What about me? Can we get the check? Okay, well, I have something for you in my car. Arthur, no one's recording you right now. - You sure? How do you know that? - I... I know it. It's two years... She'd be nine. You believe that? I love you... with all my heart. Remember, Dad? Detective. Is that a burn? New one to me. Who's that? - Any leads on who took the body? - Body! - Pick up the body! - Any leads on who took the body? Charlie. Arthur Bretnik? How do you know my name? My name's Elena Guzman. I called the show the other night. How'd you get on my property? I opened the gate, Arthur. Jimmy? Yeah. Just check your signs and relax, man. I'll make some coffee. Get your hands up. Turn around. Never mind him, Elena. Jimmy, get 'em up. We're back to this, are we? He's harmless, I promise. Turn around. Okay? My daughter's name is Zoe. She died a few days ago. We're from a small town called Wander. About 90 miles from here. The cops told me that she was in a car accident, but when I went to ID her body, she had a wound on her chest. - What kind of wound? - It was a hole. Whatever it was, she wasn't in a car accident. - I'm sorry for your daughter, Elena, but I can't help you. - I'm begging you. Arthur, she can pay. I can pay! $10,000, half up front. Please. So I didn't tell you the whole truth, but it was her daughter, for God's sake. - You of all people should know... - Don't, Jimmy. 10K is a hell of a lot of money and I'm only charging the 20% finder's fee. Oh, really? What else didn't you tell me, Jimmy? Nothing. Talked to her on the phone, told her to meet me here, that's it. - You're too trusting. - Oh, well, I think I balance the two of us out very nicely in that regard. Let me show you something. Look at this. You know, the hole Elena said she saw in her daughter's chest. Yeah, what about it? Ah. It sounds like the exact same death wound my John Doe had at the church. Jesus, Arthur. Is it a coincidence, Jimmy? Coincidence? There are no coincidences! Ah. You're going to Wander, I see. Okay, I'll be your wingman. No! No, no, you stay here. I need you here. Shit. Whoever did this to Zoe is connected to my John Doe. And is responsible for the crash that destroyed my family. They tried to kill me. I don't know who you are, but I'm coming for you. So this woman, who lost her daughter, too, she said she wants some help. There might be something to this, Tan. This could be the break we've been waiting for. - You're going out of town? - Yeah. The pay is good, so I thought it might give me a chance to get my mind off things. - It's great. - Yeah. You'll visit Tanya? - Obviously. - She loves if you bring her... Daisies, I know. Charlie? Huh, she's with, um... - Oh. - Yeah. If you need to call, you use this. - Yeah, been through that before. - And have this on when you do. Are you gonna tell me where you're staying? No, I will text you the details. - All right? - All right. Hey, hey, hey, Junctioneers, welcome to The Thought Junction. All right, Thought Junctioneers. Think about it. You're going to work five days a week. You're working 80 hours a week and you're bringing home 40% of your paycheck. I wanna know where the money is. There's tunnels, there's bunkers underneath this earth. They have every bit of, uh, technological modus operandi. And yet you can't even put gas in the car. That's what they do. Slip it in real slow, take advantage of our inherent suggestibility. It's called, "Incrementalism." Bam, boom. You really think it's... Really? Yeah, and what happens next, Wild Horse? Curtains! Arthur Bretnik. Private Investigator audio log. Zoe Guzman Investigation. Day 1. Landed in Wander. A service highway leads you in, and a one-way trucking lane leads you out the other. Rail line sequesters the town. Then mountains. Running out. No infrastructure. Hotel, convenience store. A simple caf√©. Seems to be it. Why would anyone live here? Well. Arthur Bretnik? What? I ran your plates. What brings you to Wander, Mr. Bretnik? Mr. Bretnik? Well, the yucca's are blooming. Everyone knows everyone around these parts. We don't get a lot of visitors. So I thought I'd introduce myself to you. Well, that's not necessary, but it's very kind of you, - Sheriff... - Santiago. Santiago. Have a good day, Mr. Bretnik. I'm sure we'll be seeing each other again. That was weird. I am powerful. Arthur Bretnik. Private Investigation audio log. Zoe Guzman Investigation. 2:30 p.m. About to have follow-up interview with victim's mother, Elena Guzman. Beautiful day! Sure is. So lucky to be here. Yeah. Moved here four years ago. From where? Just wanted a change. That wasn't my question. I haven't gone in since... Yeah. You mind if I? No, go ahead. They found her on the service highway, by the Wander sign. They haven't released her body to me. She's still at the morgue. She's still at the morgue? Zoe. Gotta get going. This all in the last week? Yeah, we lost another three. And her. She knew what would happen if she ran. She didn't deserve this. None of them do. Well, talk to Canton, not me. Let's go. Have to get these reports out to Canton. - Three. - Three. - Two. - Two. - Three. - Two. Two. Three. - Two. - Two. One. - One. - Three. - Three. - Two. Two. - One. - One. They took the body! They're stealing the body from the morgue, Arthur, go! Drop the body! Any leads on who took the body? - Jimmy, you up? - Of course, I'm up! - Elena was right. - Whoa, whoa, okay, hang on, hang on, slow down. Elena was right about the hole in Zoe's chest. Yeah, I'm gonna send you some photos, okay? You get 'em? And there were other bodies too. - With a hole? - Oh, yeah. Arthur? Arthur? You okay? Yeah, I'm being watched. - Jimmy, can you do something for me? - Okay. On my computer there's a program called "9erwire." It accesses the federal database where all 911 calls are housed. Okay, bingo, got it. I need to know who called in Zoe's body. Wait, hold up. My SIM's compromised, Jimmy. I'm gonna text you a new number. Oh, one second. He finally tell you where he's at? No, but he gave me a new number. I'm gonna call him, okay? Mm-hmm. Quite the operation he's got going on. The man's got ingenuity in spades, I'll give him that. He's not picking up. Zoe Guzman Investigation. Day 2. 2:57 p.m. Gone to the Wander sign, look for Zoe's car. Victim site, appears to be a vehicle crash. Vehicle appears to be bigger. Thick tread. Seen this vehicle before, white Cherokee. Definitely being followed. A secret place out. The can? Hey, Jimmy, did you find it? There's no 911 call on file, man. - No, there had to be. - They probably had it pulled. What are you talking about? They don't pull 911 calls. Hey Jimmy, I got to go. Come on! Arthur Bretnik, audio log. They're bringing people here. Did they bring me here? Stay focused, Arthur. I need to find Zoe's vehicle. More answers might be inside. There's a scrapyard on the edge of town. If the vehicle Zoe was in is anywhere... I found the vehicle Zoe was driving. Some kinda G-Card inside. They shot at me. They're toying with me. They know I'm here. They want me here. You wanna know my fortune, Daddy? - Hey, Shelley. - Arthur? Hey, you on that phone I gave you? - Yeah. - You got the jammer on? - Yeah. - Listen, I can't get ahold of Jimmy. - Of course, you can't. - Can you do me a favor? - Sure. - At my place, in the box you gave me, there's photos. Can you see if there's any of a woman with blonde hair and a black hat? If so, send me a pic of it, will ya? - Are you sure you're okay? - Yeah, Shell, I promise. I'll go after this. All right, tell Tanya I love her. I will. Arthur Bretnik. Zoe Guzman Investigation. Day 3. My motel was clearly compromised. I'm setting up a new base now a couple miles outta town. At the Spruce Winds Cabins now. Going back to check out the garage. It's the hub. This isn't gonna end well for you, Arthur. Hey, Charlie. Where's neglectful Uncle Jimmy, huh? Where's Uncle Scumbag Jimmy? Oh, man. - Hey! - Goddamn... Oh, oh! - Can I have a little privacy? - Jimmy? Goddamn, put the gun down. Put the fucking gun down! What happened to your arm? - Where's Charlie? - He's got food and water for days. - How'd you find me? - You sounded off on your voice mail, I came here, - the front door lady let me in. - I said I was here in my voice mail? You overdoing your meds again, man? Go on... Get... Give a minute, okay? Just go on. Go on. He left Charlie tied up outside in the sun with food and water. - Who does that? - Is he okay? - Yeah, 'cause he's a trouper and he's the best dog. - Hey, did you get those photos? Yeah, and everything on the investigation you said you're leaving alone. Sort of in a hurry here, Shell. Okay, I found it. - Oh, oh, oh, oh. - What? Let's do this, Arthur boy. Jimmy's there? - He just showed up. - You lied to me, Arthur. You know, this is how it starts. He gets in your head, he works you up. - I'll call you later, Shell. - Arthur? Let's go for a drive. Come on, baby, let's go for a drive. You look like shit, Arthur. Yeah, but I smell great. Check out this picture Shelley just texted me. Look, this... That's the first day I got here. The sheriff and her. Huh? I knew I recognized her! She was there, the John Doe scene at the church. You think she's behind the crash with your family? Yeah, I do! I mean she's there. Jimmy. They bring them, take them there. There's an entire underground bunker, there's cells monitoring this whole place. - Wander is like a... it's a testing ground. - No shit. And they insert these implants. They're keeping them here, they're tracking 'em. Just like we've talked about all this time. My God. New version or the old? Zoe tried to run. Jimmy, listen to me. I've scoured every police database I can find, Zoe never shows up. But look at this. Jimmy, check out this missing person's report. - Martina Lopez? - No, Zoe. Elena's been lying to us the whole time, Jimmy. Her real name isn't Elena. It's Sofia Lopez, and Zoe is Martina Lopez. Both reported missing. The people controlling all this, they're clearly... They're bringing people here. They're changing their names, they're erasing their past. I mean, the people here in Wander, they're all trapped. Jimmy, she knows you. Gives us away. - I'll be round back. - Roger that. - Why'd they send you to me? - It's all your fault! They killed her! Zoe's dead because of you. Jimmy's in on it. Arthur! Jesus Christ, Arthur. Goddamn. Did you shoot her, Arthur? Jimmy, I can't remember telling you where I was in my voice mail. Huh? "Jimmy's in on it." - That's the last thing she said. - Let's just take a deep breath. No, Jimmy, see, I'm getting confused and I can't decipher if it's you or if it's me! All right. I'll make a confession, Arthur. I lied to you. Elena first made contact with me through the PI website that I built for you. And I told her to call the show. I, uh, needed the money. And I'm sorry, all right? But I always had a gut feeling that there was... there was something more to all of this... Wander, Elena, Zoe... - Jimmy. - Some link between here and what happened to your family. - Don't talk about my family. - And I was right. We were right. Jimmy, I'm barely hanging on here. Arthur. We're pinning down the truth. Stay with it. You know me. Do I, Jimmy? I'll take it from here. Five miles inland... on the edge of the Valley of Fire. Marked by a cross. I never wanted blood on my hands. It's a war, Jimmy... between the dark and the light. Light. You're light, Jimmy. I hope so. Every name on this ledger comes back as a missing person. Every one of these people are trapped in Wander. - Martina, Sofia... - Zoe and Elena. Reported missing, Amarillo, Texas. We got these two. All right, I saw them at the truck stop and then trapped at the Fox Hole. Men, women, different ages, various races. Yeah, but they all have one thing in common. Hell yeah, they're all immigrants. That's Ukraine, Syria, Trinidad, Korea. I mean the list goes on and on. And what the hell does it have to do with you. I got too close to my John Doe case. But why lure you here? Well, we're gonna find out. Jimmy, tomorrow I'm going back to the Fox Hole. Hell yeah. This needs to be exposed. Hey, Shell. Look, I haven't been totally honest about what I've been working on here in Wander. I got hired to investigate a murder. But here's the thing, Shell. It's linked to something bigger. And I'm directly involved. All I need is a name, Shell. This time, I'm gonna prove it all. Look... hey, whoa. I checked it out, Wander. It's a sleepy old town. - He's... he's fine. - I'm gonna go. - Shell, this is not your battle to fight with him. - He's done this before. He stretches stories, changes the truth, becomes completely delusional. Right, and who does he always drag into it? He's going to end up hurting himself or someone else. Like you. And I don't want that to happen. So let's give it the night. And if he still doesn't answer his phone, we will go down there and we'll go down together and we'll sort it all out. All right, this is the Fox Hole. No one's here this time of day. I'm gonna download everything from the computers. You get the footage of everything from inside the lab. If I go down... you keep running. And, Jimmy, if that happens, you gotta promise me one thing. - Yeah? - You take care of Tanya. I will. Let's go. - Arthur? - Shelley. What happened? I know you're in Wander. - Shelley, I need you here tomorrow. - Arthur, you have to stop, - 'cause you're not well and Jimmy just perpetuates it... - Jimmy's dead. - What? - They killed him. What are you talking about? Shelley, I need you here tomorrow morning, 10:00 a.m. I'll text you the details as soon as I know them. - Arthur, Arthur, wait, please. - It'll all make sense tomorrow. Hey. What's going on? Really? Really? On your knees, hands up, Arthur! Down on your knees! Arthur, hands up! Down, down! Hands up. Let's go over this again. We've ID'd everyone in that photo. All Wander locals. Victor Canton, local doctor. - A resident of Wander for 25 years. He's a scientist... - No. He created the chip technology. He's selling it to people, putting it into people. They were all involved. With the implants, my accident, everything. The entrance to the Fox Hole was right there. Right there. You open this garage, there's a red car there. You push a lever, the car goes up. There is nothing there, Arthur. That's impossible. I took Jimmy there to gather evidence. What? No. Welcome to the Fox Hole. I would like to commend you on signing up for this noble venture. You are helping our country grow in ways that will benefit our social structure and national security for years to come. So what type of medical testing did you volunteer for? A C68 biochip, the world's leading device in human near-field technology. They're here! Stay here. Keep downloading that. Turn around, Jimmy. Gotta be a way out of here. Stairs in back... Come on, Jimmy! Ah! Jimmy! Jimmy! I'm sorry, Arthur. So close, Arthur. Come on, move! Move! Up the stairs! Come on! Go, go, go! Come on. Bag, phone, keys. If you want the truth about what happened to your wife and daughter, you'll work with me. Come on, let's go. We gotta go. Move! And there was a woman too, Elsa. CIA, I think. She took me to the garage. She's the one in the photos you texted me, Shell. Her? Yeah. Her name's Kimberly Clark. She was actually a witness at the crime scene. No, she wasn't. She took me to a safe house. Sheriff Santiago was there. And they told me who was behind everything. They prey on runaways. Lower class, broken homes. Immigrants. There, I said it for you. They lure them here with the promise of money, housing, in exchange for medical testing. Insert the implant and they're trapped. I'm not who you think I am, Arthur. We're all on the same team. You can call me "Elsa." Come on, I got something to show you. His real name was Filipe Jimenez. Your John Doe from the church. He's a Colombian refugee who escaped when his implant malfunctioned. Canton couldn't have you looking into things, - so he had the body stolen from the morgue. - Who's Canton? Victor Canton. Early adopter of chip technology. He single-handedly advanced the field. He developed tech that could track movement, location, vitals. It was revolutionary. And attractive to foreign investors. Now, what's the Oryon Project? Canton changed. He got greedy. Funding sources became anonymous. Bigger parties with deeper pockets. The fact that Wander uses immigrants for its testing is not an accident. He took a black ops government security contract and shifted his focus to border control. Border control. He'll control everybody. So there's that. The chip links directly to the subject's central nervous system. When it reaches a set radius, it could be frozen or shut down. And you guys can murder whoever you want. Not exactly how Canton sees it, but yes. He told us his intentions were to progress the greater good of humanity, not to create weapons for the highest bidder. And you just go along for the ride, huh? Not anymore. Wander has helped shape Canton's business model. Him and his investors are on the verge of going wide with the tech. - Why am I here? - Canton was the one that made the call on the hit and run of your car. He killed my daughter? I wanted you to know that. I am so sorry. You've been watching me? Because I've been waiting for the day I could tell you all this. You deserved to know the truth. The truth. Arthur, you are here because I wanna offer you an opportunity. - What opportunity? - I know the pain Canton's actions have caused you with Tanya. I know how you struggle with what happened to Cleo. You don't know anything. I've lost people too. It's not right. Canton is hardly ever here in Wander, but there's a meeting set tomorrow morning. It's his last meeting before he sells the Oryon Project. Arthur, you can't tell me you don't wanna go face to face with the man that destroyed your family, to get revenge for your daughter. Justice. That's the opportunity I'm offering you. The plan was... it was set. That's when I called you, Shell. Arthur! Shelley, Jimmy's dead. But, uh, the things, they changed. First time meeting him. Luis. Follow my lead. Santiago, what are we doing here? Now! What are you doing? Always knew I couldn't trust you. Elsa, Santiago told me you were shot dead yesterday. Had to get you here somehow. Lost your focus a long time ago, Victor, and I'm tired. What are you doing? You want your apology? Now's your chance. Victor Canton, meet Arthur Bretnik. Do it, Arthur. He murdered your daughter. You think killing me is gonna stop any of this? Shooting me is exactly what they want. You shoot, they win. Just why don't you say it? - You have no idea the complexities... - Say it! - This is bigger than all of us. - Say it! You were supposed to be alone. I wasn't driving the truck. Say it! Say it! Look at that. Look at that determination. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Arthur, it's okay. Drop the gun. I'll handle this. Get to the office and wipe down the computer. It's done. Give us a minute. You know, these are psychotics. And they're known to create acute anxiety and paranoid delusions in people with a history of mental illness. How long you been mixing these? They played you. You don't know how powerful these people are. They're connected everywhere. For all I know, this is all part of it. Listen, I'm here as your lawyer, not just your friend. And I wonder if there's anything we're missing. You want proof? I have one of the chips in me! After the accident, they put a chip in me. Are you one of them? I think you're sick again, Arthur. You need to check the addresses again. - Just check 'em. - We checked... They checked every address. - They went to Elena's house. - Check 'em again. - It was boarded up. - Check 'em again. And the property was reclaimed after the owner died. The bank claimed it. And the morgue where you said you found the bodies, it hasn't been in use for years. We found your car. What do you mean, you found my car? You... you found it? You found my car? Yeah. What's the problem? 'Cause it has all the files from the case. It has the addresses I can't remember. But the problem is what we found in your car. What did you find? Jimmy. He was decapitated. Did I... Hi. Morning. You and that stuff. Anything interesting? We're all just puppets to the man. Arthur Bretnik, my resident conspiracist. I like airplanes. How you doing, Arthur boy? Jimmy. I knew it. I knew it. I made you a promise. Tanya will never want for anything. Of that, you can be sure. Whose body was in the trunk? Does it really matter, Arthur? Did Canton actually order the hit on my family? I need to know. You deserved your revenge. - Yes or no? - Arthur. - Tell me! - Yes, Arthur. He did. We owed you that much. Why me? Every good conspiracy needs a patsy. When Filipe and Zoe escaped, Wander and Canton became a liability. We needed to clean things up. We knew if we left you enough clues... nudged you in the right direction... someone in your mental state might be able to shoulder the burden of tying up loose ends. If anyone ever tries to expose what's happening in Wander, we'll be able to deflect, pin it back to you. A man unhinged. Who are you people? And you said it yourself, Arthur. It's all about keeping a tight grip. Immigration, incarceration, border control... these are all big concerns for us. Pawn, patsy or dead. Two outta three ain't bad, huh, Jimmy? Hmm, you're a good man, Arthur. A silent warrior. All right now, Thought Junctioneers. I wanna talk about trust, okay? Who do you trust? Can you trust, I don't know, say, the person sitting next to you, huh? And what do you really know about them? Look at their face. They look like they have a modicum of morality or ethics. But do they really? I am powerful. I am protected. Now why don't you try an experiment for me? Next time you hear about a homicide or an unfortunate accident, I want you to look at the person associated with that act and ask yourself, "If he was walking down the street, would you believe that he is capable of such an act?" Hmm. Look at the person sitting next to you. Look at them. I mean really look at them. Look in their eyes, look inside their soul. Ask yourself questions, "Is he capable of that?" "Am I capable of that?" You ready for our walk? - Arthur. - Search your souls, people. You don't know what you're gonna find. - Arthur, open up! - This is Atlas Major with Thought Junction. - Arthur! - I'll catch you all next week. Hey, Shell. Look, I haven't been totally honest about what I've been working on here in Wander. I got hired to investigate a murder. All I ever wanted was the truth. I don't know why, but for the first time in a long time, I have hope. Let's see what plays out.
