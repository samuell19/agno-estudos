PROLOGUE I'M A FAGGOT I decided that one day I would wear a crown to school. So, the third day of school, I came in wearing a princess crown. It was a super beautiful crown, with fake beading, pink hair.... And it was a little weird because, even though I was pretty used to it, everybody started looking at me. And from that moment on, everybody started to know me and everybody started to talk about me. Especially bad things, of which I remember.... 'faggot', they also called me 'that dude'. Many of you have not realized that when I put on a crown, it is a political act. And when I put on a princess backpack, I'm fighting a system that oppresses me. And when I wear pink, and I go out and attract attention, I'm fighting against a society that rejects me and denies me the right to enjoy my own life. Because I'm in danger for being who I am. And when I go out on the streets, I'm scared. And the ten minutes it takes me to go from Plaza España to school and back, I'm scared I'm gonna run into some bastard who'll go crazy and beat me up or kill me. Hi! I'm Kevin and it's good to be here! Today I bring you a recommendation in SpanishQueens. You've probably seen Samantha Hudson's video, it's a music video, where... well, God calls Samantha and says, ''Hey, we don't admit you into our Christian flock cos you're a faggot.'' The video is now on its 40,000 views. This guy's from Majorca, like me. So, well, I'm not going to spoil you I'll show you a little bit of the video to bring yourself to watch it. I'm a faggot and I love church But they won't let me in Because I get into hot water I always wear tops and miniskirts I'm very trampy And the nuns seem to have a problem with that I'm a faggot and I love Jesus Christ But that doesn't really matter to the fucking bishop He kicked me out of the church for making a scene I was just yelling at Jesus I wish I could fuck him I'm a faggot Nobody could have ever thought that this video would go so far and create so much controversy. After all, it was a work he had been asked to do in high school. He did it, he presented to and got an incredible grade. Faggot Faggot Faggot Faggot But because of the religion teacher, a time bomb exploded. THE CHILDREN'S OMBUDSMAN OPEN PROCEEDINGS FOR THE BLASPHEMOUS VIDEO I'm a faggot and they call me Samantha But don't think I cover myself with a blanket I think he was so inconsiderate and overwhelmed. Iván, where are you? I'm not taking any pictures of you, I'm just recording, silly. Iván was terrible. If it wasn't what he wanted, he threw himself to the ground he made a fuss and a big row that that made us all die of shame. When I met him he didn't even have a viral video yet, but he was already going out in heels and with Frozen socks, stolen from the Disney store. He's very creative. He loves music, I didn't know that this kind of music, but yes, he loves music. I proclaim myself creator of Samantha's hit. Because he sent me the video, like... when your son shows you the macaroni necklace he has made. And I saw the potential of that video, of that song And I saw that it had a lot of views to be on a private channel, on a school channel, and I said, ''This has to be amazing in live''. So, I ran over to the computer and created a profile of him. But a company profile, to commercialize that channel. Since I had suffered so many setbacks as I was becoming youtuber, I already knew what mistakes not to make. I didn't know Samantha until the boom in Palma de Mallorca that left us all quite surprised. Yeah, we all knew he was gay, and we've all accepted that because it's something normal, but Samantha caught us by surprise. And if I've been so happy at this institute, it's because of all the diversity, that they are like they are and they struggle to remain so. So, am I a faggot? Yes. Am I that dude? Yes. And I hope to be one all my life. Stop filming now, you're a pest! A STORY OF FAITH, SEX AND ELECTRO-QUEER PART I THE PEAK If I don't do it now, when will I do it? Never. It looks like my eyelids are like super deep now. It seems I've been crying. I'm a super-sensitive girl. All straight men look at my ass And even if they don't say it I know they have a boner They say they look at me Because I'm that dude But they don't cheat on me They like my butt I move it down I move it up Come on. Who gives more than 25? Fifty! Fifty? Why, are you married? Axel is married, guys, so, the bidding is cancelled. Cementerios, you can play the next song. This one's super good. Do you know it? I'm wearing heels to buy bread And no one knows But they're from the Chinese bazaar All my jewels are from Eroski But I say they're Swarovsky My makeup is from a drugstore But if you ask me, I'll say it's a lie Maybe I haven't got a Fiat 500 But I've got the keys that can pull you a leg Let's go to the Cappuccino for an espresso No, girl, paparazzi stress me out. Oh, girl, we don't make cool plans anymore - You won't be... - Girl! Working class? No way! Because I'm a ruined bourgeois woman Because I'm a ruined bourgeois woman Because I'm a ruined bourgeois woman And I've spent it all on bingo Because I'm a ruined bourgeois woman Because I'm a ruined bourgeois woman Because I'm a ruined bourgeois woman And I've spent it all on bingo Iván y Samantha are not like two different things. I mean... when I was a kid I thought I was trans. So, to explore all these things I created a drag-queen character called Giovanna Bon Dage. And I made a separation, a dichotomy, between my masculine self that was Iván, and my feminine self that was Giovanna Bon Dage. So, I was like... differentiating my personality in two ways. Later, I realized that this was absurd, cos I didn't have to separate myself into two, it's completely understandable that in the same person there is a feminine side and a masculine side. So, Samantha would be like the representation of this thought and this reflection that I became aware. So, for me, Samantha is like Iván and Giovanna together, is like an evolution of myself. And that's what I am now. It's like the combination of those two personalities I thought I had to separate. He was crazy about going to Barcelona, to him that was fucking great. I mean, ''I'm going away Palma, I'm leaving mom and dad, I have wings and I'll fly by myself.'' He went away super excited, eager to conquer the world. I'm sick of being stopped on the street because they think I'm Drew Barrymore. Well, I'm not Drew Barrymore. And Selena Winters as well. ''Are you Lucy Liu?'' She's not even Asian! A girl asked me the other day, ''Are you Lucy Lawless? The actress who plays Xena in the hit TV series Xena: Warrior Princess. And I was like... Samantha's a crazy woman. An inconsistent crazy woman. Because he acts without thinking. Samantha says what she wants. She's impulsive, shameless, very shameless, she's very crazy... But I think it's because of Samantha's age. Maybe Samantha with 25 or 30 years old is another kind of Samantha. Samantha lacks maturity. They have bags with other phrases, but I chose this one because it was my nickname during high school and it's something very special to me. He's got two personalities. The fun and entertainment part, that represents the irony, the sarcasm... I don't know, the trash world, the gay world... super queer... And then there's the political part, the deep one, that represents activism, diversity... I love it because it's February, it's six in the morning, and I'm dressed like this. My God, my tits have grown. It's like super mega worrying. I have huge boobs. I just ran into two gay guys. And they yelled at me, ''Pretty!''. And I think it's pathetic if they think it's funny that a man has female beauty. I mean, is like what the fuck. Give me one shot, one shot, of adrenaline Didn't you go to class? We have to buy some booze. Wine... What do you think I'm gonna buy? Gin? It costs five Euros. I can swipe it... I hope you do the trick of leaving it in the cart. No, I'll do the shoulder trick. And I keep it there.... You dislocate your shoulder and you... We met because a friend of mine she wanted us to be boyfriends. This was with 15 or 16 years old. I think I had 15 and he had 13. Something like that. In those days I was like.... I wasn't gay, I was kind of homophobe, you know? So, the first thing I felt was rejection. I was like, ''No, no, no...'' Then we talked a lot through WhatsApp. I wish the neighbour sees me. Then one day we plan to meet alone and then we became sisters. And we realized we had a lot in common. You've got them faded, fucking pig! No! It's the elastic band. I think I have to buy new underwear. Don't complain! I'll give you ones. Who knows whose they are. I got a pimple in my ass, man. Remember when I got a pimple on my ass that was disgusting? And he helped me a lot to realize that I was... super gay. Sister, sister, sister… Something's wrong. Sister, please.... Sister, sister, sister, sister, where are you? You're beside a broken mirror! SHE'S DRUNK Can you get my jacket, please? I'm going to kick your fucking ass if you film this shit. I'm not filming... And why do you have that flash on your mobile? To figure out how to help you, it's dark in... So, I came to Barcelona. So, I could study what I really like, live with my sister, that has always been our dream and be totally free. We' re going to run three businesses! - What? - I swear, in the house. First, Xesc is going to read the tarot here and we are going to get paid for it. And why do we get paid and not Xesc? Fuck! Because it's our house. - Next.... - And Xesc doesn't get paid? A little, but... I'll do the accounts and you'll open the door. I'll handle the appointments. We'll also do that thing where people leave their bags here in one place, you know? And the third business it's about sleeping here one night.... AirBnB. Yeah, I think it's illegal, but whatever. Toni Poni told me not to start this here. If we do, he'll report us. The fine is like 3,000 euros. But who knows this is an AirBnB? I don't understand about Xesc, did he tell you? No, I said it myself. I wanna handle the appointments. No, I'm the receptionist. But I sing? Wait, I'm gonna go check that thing... OK. For a few months now I've begun to frequent Personal ads To find love I always talk to strangers Day and night, without stopping And I've eyed an Australian That I'm starting to like him He doesn't have any pictures of his face But I don't care Because he told me That he's going to call me by Skype Eat my pussy once a day Zero sugars Omega 3 Eat, eat, eat my pussy - Does it end like this? - Yeah. Okay, what details can we put in to make it sound better? I don't know. Do we record the voice first? And then... Really? Because without... OK. Wait, I'm going to write down the beginnings of this, because that's what I always forget. Afterward I know how to follow. I always record with the lyrics in front of me. Really? But at the concerts you remember all your lyrics. No. I don't like his music nor what his lyrics say. I respect him, he's my nephew and he's free to do what he wants. But I don't like it because it hurts a lot of people. And if it doesn't hurt them, it can be offensive to them, there can be consequences. Being honest, I've only seen the fan part. I mean, really. In La Pringada I do see this hater part when she released the video. All the young people loved it. Even if it wasn't that person's taste, it was like, ''Wow, man, LOL, LOL''. But it's still his life and he decides what he does with it. I respect it even if I don't like it. Eat my pussy It's got positive calories, Vitamin C Eat, eat, eat my pussy Once a day Zero sugars Omega 3 Eat, eat, eat my pussy It's got a lot of fiber A lot of bifidus for the toilet Eat me, eat me And if you don't like it Well, I'm so sorry I don't change, so fuck you Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you You'll say, what hair are you shaving? Well, I don't know, but sometimes it comes out. Unfortunately. One day I went to a beauty shop and I told the girl I had a lot of hair, so, besides she tried to sell me a cream, she told me to go to church with her. So, you have already seen that the grace of the Lord can do anything. Why do you get the Laser Hair Removal, if you have the church to pray for it? Well, because you're dumb. It's true. What are you doing with that person? What are you doing with that one? Mostly homophobes and all those people. Well, I do whatever I want. Love is free. But I prefer roast beef, I'm the bitch The bad bitch Samantha I'm the bitch, the bad bitch Samantha I'm the bitch the bad bitch Samantha I'm the bitch the bad bitch Samantha Room tour, first. Hi! I can't... I'm going to show you my room, my new room, cos I've moved. Come here. It's very small, because I like very enclosed spaces, and here I have my posters like I'm a teenager, of all my cultural idols. There Rocky Horror, this is Hannah Montana. Two postcards of Maria Isabel with mythical phrases. That's the cross from my grandma's coffin, whose funeral was about a year ago. When I looked myself in the mirror, then I looked at him, and he looked at me like that. He's like, ''Wow Samantha, you look so good'' and I could go out ready and steady. This coat was my grandma's and it matches the costume jewellery I took from her. When she died, I took all her jewellery. This is one of my favourite pieces because it's a sweater with my face on it. And this is my favourite dress, a Shin-Chan's dress. I wear it at my most important events like... baptisms. This is my Pepa Pig diary. This is where I write all my secrets. This is my favourite thing, it's a big dildo, and I've only used it once. This one's smaller. I'll show you. This one's about 16 centimeters long. In the box, it looks like super big, but it's a shit actually. It's good to me because I'm power bottom, but... I stick the whole thing in me not long ago because I felt like it. So, I used a lot of lube and I stick the whole thing in. But I didn't really enjoy it, it was just like an achievement. Like, ''Today I'll stick the whole thing in''. Next to the dildo I have a picture with my grandma. Have you seen it? This was me when I was a kid, I was blond. Sometimes I sit here, and I rest. REQUIEM FOR GRANDMA A wooden box A simple chest With a whole life inside it Tell me where you're taking her Tell me I'll do whatever you want Please It hurts my heart Because of its absence It hurts, because of its absence My heart Is heart-breaking to me Today my eyes weep with sadness Because his presence is gone It's very hard to play the piano. Guys, I had sex today. I've had a lot of anal sex. Like a table leg was beating up my ass. And I've realized that I don't like it. I mean, I like it because I enjoy it, but it doesn't satisfy me. The more I do it, the less I feel like I want to repeat. I wish I was a sex hooligan, I wish I was a super fan and said ''Hey, sex, I love you''. But I can't. It's so hard. Unless it's with your husband. No, seriously, does this happen to any of you too? Or is it just me? Leave me a comment and subscribe! No. Why don't you make an omelette and then give it to me? - No - OK. The other day... we had a threesome, the sister and I.... What? With who? We went out partying in Choco-Churros. Then I turned around and there was another guy who was like a gorilla. You told me you said, ''Hello, do you have a boyfriend?'' We ended up in his house and... A super nice loft. David, it's not a loft, it's got walls.... The living room and the kitchen were all... Well, we fucked. Well... he lost his boner. - He? - Yes. Cos he was drunk. You were jerking him off or something. Well, I liked it, it gave me pleasure, in fact, we fucked twice. But then I thought better of it and I hadn't enjoyed it much. Because I had no link to him. Sometimes I feel like I only sleep with men to satisfy a desire, to feel sexually attractive. And that desire is never satisfied, it makes it worse. Cos you don't feel good about yourself? No, because I fuck people who don't provide me with anything. A lot of people at Instagram have told me I'm demisexual. No Maybe, yes. No, no, no... You're not a demisexual, sister, you've fucked with a lot of men. - Maybe it doesn't satisfy you... - But it's not like pleasant sex, it's not about sexual attraction. Most of the time I did it because I was drunk or insecure. Why would I fuck a 63-year-old man if I'm not attracted to him? I think sometimes you do it like, should I fuck someone or should I fuck someone? Well, Yes. I do that because of insecurity, I think. I don't know. But I don't believe in demisexuality either. A lot of people are telling me that the solution to my sex problems is to stop being bottom. Never! The conflict is not in the role I adopt in bed, because I'm very happy to be a power bottom, it's just that it is so hard for me to create a link with people. It's like, ''Why should I fuck with you if you don't interest me?'' I think I should have sex with more trustworthy people. I wish I could fuck my father. I don't follow him cos there are things I'd rather not see, or not know. Because I don't know how to separate the character from the person. Maybe because I'm his aunt and because I love him so much, and I don't know how to separate it. I can't see the two of them separately for me he's my nephew, he's my child, and I don't care if he's playing Samantha or Iván. I've already got tested, and I recommend that if you've had sex, risky sexual practices, even if you didn't have it, get tested. It was so funny, because I had to have a test in my anus and I stuck a stick up my ass to get the sample out. And when I took it out there was a giant hair, like super long, like three centimeters long. But there's always a moment when I said, ''I'm going to see what he has upload, I'm going to see what fucking madness he's done now. These are precise moments but I don't usually follow him. I think it hurts me more to follow him all the time than to know the minimum necessary. And that's what I do, I know the minimum necessary. Guys, I'm an asshole. And two days after I got tested for STDs, I swallowed a stranger's semen. So, I'm going back to the Sexual Health Center. I mean, I have two rankings when we talk about drugs and using drugs. For example, there are the little drugs that I use and then there are the drugs. The little drugs include alcohol, cigarettes and joints, which are like things that don't affect so much your way of being. I know that most of excess deaths in Spain and in the world are from tobacco and alcohol. Well, yes, but why? Because they're the legal. Then, drugs include everything else. Like: cocaine, speed... All this shit I that I don't even control. This weekend I have tried... one of the drugs. And I'm super radical for that, but... I think, if you use your head, you can do everything. But if you use a hard drug, a drug like that, what are you thinking about? If the alcohol, it's giving you an effect that's okay. Why do you want to use another drug? You know, that drug can kill you. How many times have you heard that someone who's been using cocaine or speed or shit like that, killed someone and then he said, ''Holy shit, I killed this person''. And you would say, ''Knowing all this information, Sele, why did you consume cocaine this weekend?'' Well, I don't have a logical answer, to be honest. But I did, because I felt like it That's all. I'm going to Adrià's to keep working on the album. Today, while I was getting ready at home, I've thought about one thing, and that's I'm an artist. I mean, a band I really like has released an album, and it's got songs like super cool. And I've been thinking, ''You're geniuses, how do you come up with these letters and stuff?'' And then I thought, ''Fuck, that's what people say to me, you know?'' Well, not all people, I'm not Lady Gaga. But sometimes they say to me, ''How did you get inspired to do that thing?'' And I'm like... I don't know, random. It just come to my mind. Yeah, I think he can succeed. She's very lazy. Really, she's a very slack person. And I think if he wants, he can. He who wants to, does more than he who can. He doesn't do anything. He doesn't have a YouTube channel, he doesn't upload photos in a regular way, he doesn't change the content, doesn't upload new songs nor video clips, he doesn't do collaborations, he doesn't do anything. I mean, what does he do? He does four gigs in clubs with four 40-year-old faggots, and that's it? He could do more things and he knows it, because his songs are so good, but he doesn’t take advantage of it. Sometimes I forget that what I do is something cool. Do you understand me? I fucked him and I got herpes on my mouth, but it's not because of it, because the test was negative... His face's weird in this picture, don't you think? This part is like... straight and in this part has volume. Right. It's like a figure that is in 2D and in 3D at the same time. And did you like it? If you want, we can keep on with 'Eat my pussy' o we can do 'Bitch juice'. - Do you have the lyrics? - Yes, on the mobile. Let's go. And then you add everything? Because 'Bitch Juice' wasn't completed yet... Let's see. Last thing you add was like a violin and that sounded super good because it looked like very... - cool. - Yeah. Bitch juice Come come come Bitch juice Come and help me Sound good. - Really? - You can do it higher. This is so funny! I swear I ca do it. I swear I ca do it! Since the day I saw you - No. - I can't do the tone. Since the day I saw you Dress of Ágatha Ruiz I knew you were meant for me I like this. And here you can sing the chorus if you want. You, my Chicote Another verse like that. And we'll both be together Cooking love You, my Chicote And I, your little girl And we'll both be together Cooking love - I was on my way back from a party. - To you home? I was coming back alone, I don't know why. Because I don't know where the hell she was. Then she freaked out, cos you come home, and someone tell you ''Hey, I fucked a beggar.'' Well, she freaked out. A really weird guy was following me and I turned around and I saw him stop. Like, when I looked at him, he stopped. Then I kept walking again and he kept following me, and I told him... But what was he like? Toothless. - How old? - You've already spoiled it! Very bad. - Forty-two? - Two. Well, 45 if you want to round off. But he was a very strange guy. And I stood up, and he came like... It was obvious he was following me. And I said, ''Are you following me?'' He said, ''Yeah''. And me, ''Because you want sex?'' And he said yes. And since I was very drunk, I said, ''Let's go''. And we went to the door of the Tango and I said: ''What do you want?'' And he said he wanted oral sex. Then he sucked my dick happily and he left. - Anal or oral? - Oral. I have anal sex with a beggar and I kill myself. And you weren't afraid of getting...? No, because I thought, ''Well, he did it to me, it's okay.'' I didn't think I could get anything from his mouth to my penis. But I didn't get anything, I'm cool. So, I think he were toothless because it was like a very strange touch, and sometimes he smiled and his mouth was black. Yuck, Samantha! But I was really drunk, maybe it's like an effect of alcohol, but I don't know... And... I don't know. - And you came? - Yeah. In his mouth? So bad! He was a very gentlemanly and kind man. I think he was just a pedophile. - Well... - I don't know. - Sound recording? - Yes! - Camera recording? - Yes! OK, action sound. 'Samantha pictures on the street'. - First. - First. How should do I pose? You can imitate this girl's posture. I've always been behind this. I take care of the lights or the outfit. And there's a song where I sing a sentence. Hello sister, Tell me what's going on I left home without my panties on Camera recording? Second picture. Second... I've been jealous sometimes, actually. But, I don't know. From whom was Selena Winters born? Nobody says 'Selena Winters' without thinking of Samantha first. Samantha Hudson! It's not like... ''I'm so jealous!'' Because I don't really like it, I mean, it's not my vocation to be a singer. Because I'm a terrible singer. I love to sing, but since I sing so badly, why should I sing? I'm a better dancer than singer. I've never been in love with Samantha, ever. I forced myself to like her when I met her. I did it to bother a friend. Everyone thinks he's got a life rhythm like, ''party, party, party''. We go partying on weekends and some Thursday, but we don't go partying every day. - Battery low. - Fuck! Just like you. I think he has a rhythm of life that doesn't do justice with what he wanted. Like looking for a job, like... write lyrics and stuff, do songs. It's up to him. I'm answering you because you're asking me, but it's up to him. PART II THE FALL Guys, I'm in Seville. It has rained, and I corroborate that the rain in Seville is a marvel. Wow, it's so cool! - That's the Giralda. - What is the Giralda? Hi! This is an unboxing, well, like a haul, because I went shopping in Seville and I bought wonder things at Humana and I'm going to show them to you. Because I have nothing else to do. The first thing I bought was this. It's a vest, like super cool. And buttoned up like before it's a beautiful top. This is... leggings. Have you seen? SAMANTHA HUDSON HAS JUMPED OFF A BALCONY AND IS NOW IN A HOSPITAL IT'S ICONIC THAT SAMANTHA HUDSON COMES TO SEVILLE AND JUMPS OFF A BALCONY SAMANTHA HUDSON HAS FALLEN OFF A BALCONY AND IS NOW IN THE HOSPITAL SAMANTHA HUDSON HAS JUMPED OFF A BALCONY AND IS NOW IN THE HOSPITAL???? Iván for playing the character of Samantha has the courage to climb a wall, climb up to a balcony and fall on his face. It is the feeling I get. He wants to attract so much attention, make a good impression or even surpass his character, that he's capable of anything. And, of course, he doesn't think. What's he gonna think? What explanation can he give? My sister calls me and tells me that... she has just spoken with Iván, and he has had... and accident or a mishap or... Because it was something... he did, it wasn't an accident. It was consequences of alcohol. I didn't see my eye, for God's sake. It's scary. I FELL OFF A BALCONY It's hideous! It was amazing. Yesterday I was going to go out partying so happy, and suddenly I thought it was a really good idea to come down from a first floor throwing myself off the balcony. And I smashed myself into the floor and now I'm in the hospital. He didn't call anyone, he didn't call me... He didn't tell anyone, he just uploaded it. I think he did it on purpose. Like, ''You'll see how their faces look when they suddenly know I'm in the hospital.'' It's true, guys, it's not a joke. That I've really jumped off a balcony. But... Fuck, man, I'm super crazy. Guys, I'm gonna start a national tour, and I'm going to go to different cities in Spain to jump off balconies. How random can it be? ''Imagine if I jumped a balcony, what would people say? They'll freak out with Samantha.'' I think that's all. And if he's also drunk... It works with me, I have a bittersweet feeling about Samantha. Because it's like, ''Fuck, Iván, you go too far playing Samantha''. But then... I'm a super fan. HEY, I'M FINE THANKS YOU ALL FOR THE MESSAGES It was quite dramatic for everyone. A broken nose, a black eye, an air bubble in the head... and alone, even though he was with his friends. Jumping off a first floor... is a childish attitude, isn't it? Or an attitude of not responsible person. You can be drunk and whatever you want, but I've been drunk a thousand times and I know if I jump off this floor, I'll die. Maybe you'll tell me, ''Take that glass and do this...'' You can do this... but jumping off a first floor... We need to pull him up short. When you do acts that endanger your life, it's no longer about you playing a character and you have a lot of followers. It's about you having to know where to stop and we didn't know... if he was aware of that, and if he knew how to stop it. Hi, I'm home now. Look at my eye. Do you like it? I hope so, I've done it for you. My sister and brother-in-law told him: ''It's over. You're not going to stay in Barcelona until we know that we can trust you and that you're mature enough to say ''he's far away and we know nothing will happen''. We understand that you want to go on doing your gigs, that you have your life, with your Samantha character, but you can't keep the family on edge and we have to have a peace and confidence in you that you have to earn. She told me she was going back to Mallorca... to grow up a bit. I think she needed that. He understands it, and he said, ''It's true, I think I have a problem and when I drink can't control my actions and well... what I have to do is not drink''. Oh, my God, what a mess. It' s really funny, because the last video I filmed I was in Seville, trying on the things I had bought, and I was like, ''I go partying tonight!''... But suddenly I'm super changed and everything has taken a turn. I'm going to tell you the situation. I was going to party in Seville, but as I left my friends' entrance hall and headed for the club, my friends' neighbours went out on the balcony, like, ''Guys! Come here!''. And I literally climbed the facade, in heels and with a Shin-Chan dress. And I snuck in their balcony, I lay down on their sofa like 10 minutes, and after 10 minutes, I got up, and I jumped off the balcony. I've been in the hospital seven days or so. I have a... Well, I think the wound's closed now. I had a fracture in my forehead and eye bone. And the forehead fracture was dangerous because it connected with the brain. I'd got an air bubble in the brain... The cerebrospinal fluid, or something like that... Well, a brain fluid dripped out of my nose. Well, we'll go by car, no problem. What do I do? I have my whole life here. Well... Okay. Do you like Barcelona? Barcelona is very beautiful. You guys talking about the Catalans and it' s got really cool stuff. My God, what have I done? What madness have I done? I don't know, but that's not what worries me the most. Really, I'm fine. It could have been worse. What worries me most is... the fact that I'm going back to Majorca. I thought my end in Barcelona would be a voluntary return, with Samantha Hudson… with everything I wanted to get, but more accomplished. The thing about having the same impact again, the same fame as before, when I released 'I'm a faggot'.... all those things, all the opportunities that came my way, to get it all back and have it all well worked. And I don't know... I'm 18 years old and I'm talking like I'm gonna die. And I've got a lot of life to live and a lot of things to do. Well, I think that... I have tried to live it all very intensely and like I don't have time, but... Samantha doesn't have to succeed right now and she never has to either, you know? I don't know what Samantha's future is, I have no fucking idea. Because you're here today and you're here tomorrow. Iván's future, I'm sure is very good, because he's a really smart kid. He'll probably become an actor. Is his future, is what he wants. I believe in Iván's talent, I do. Samantha is... You know what? The figures... The figures are all fleeting, the characters do this, they change. When your fame ends, someone else's begins. I think over the years Samantha will go one way and he will grow up becoming what he really wants to be. When Samantha dies, Iván will do something else. Well, I wish, because it's not unusual he doesn't do anything. We didn't say goodbye when he went back to Majorca. I'm laughing, but it's true. Our relationship was a roller coaster ride lately. Every three weeks we'd fight for no reason. I don't think we'll ever live together again. I don't think so. But, the time changes a lot. We are very similar, we cannot always be like... Sometimes we're also like... No resentment, no hate. I don't hate him, and he doesn't hate me, I think. I have no resentments and neither does he. Maybe we need some break, I think. Or never to see each other again. I'm much better now. And it comforts me not to think that this is not... a break nor a turning back, but simply the end of a phase, which I have enjoyed very much and which I do not regret. And start another new phase. And I don't take it as Samantha's death, but as its rebirth. And the summary of all this, is that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. EPILOGUE I'M SAMANTHA Hi. Samantha's indisposed, because she was a little drunk and had an accident recently, so, she's recovering. So, the first performance, of two, I'll do it happily. The first song is the one that almost everyone knows, or I hope so, because otherwise I'm going to sleep with your sexual partners and I'm going to swallow your children. The song is called 'Faggot'. I'm a faggot Faggot Faggot Faggot Faggot Faggot Faggot I'm a faggot and the church attacks me Because I finger myself where I go poop And even though I pray Every calendar day They'll always think That I suck cocks in the toilets It's true! I'm a faggot Faggot Faggot I'm a faggot This was my first hit and it was a success in the Convent of Carmelitas Descalzas, God bless them. Unbelievable. Thank you very much to them, even if they are barefoot. I'm always naked and nobody tells me anything. A round of applause. When I walk into the club Everybody talks The bitch has arrived The one in charge has arrived All straight men look at my ass I'm the bitch The bad bitch Samantha I'm the bitch The bad bitch Samantha Eat my pussy It's so funny And super practical for stress He's the sexiest man on earth, he has a cooking show.
