Hmm. So this is it. When you return to nothing. Just a smudge on the asphalt- nameless, no past... and no future. Marona?! Help me, someone. Please help! Come on, Solange, stop yelling. You know loud noises scare me. Someone help me, please! - Marona! - Don't cry. I can't hear myself think. Marona. If no one minds too much, I'd like to take a moment to rewind the film of my life. I heard that's what you do when you die. Rewatch the story of your life. My father was an Argentinian mastiff. Ralph la Bomba Ati Mondora. He barked proudly at every mention of his noble pedigree. But not only then. Ralph, like his owners, was what you might call a racist... ...barking at every being or mutt that wasn't like him. Luckily, I inherited the philosophy of my mother: "Pekingese, mongrel or Afghan, we all deserve love and a tasty bone." So, along she came- his polar opposite. A mixed breed. He assumed all mutts ate out of trash cans, but no, my mother was a lady. Sissy. She was of every and no race at all. And his obsession switched from purity to purely her. It might be cliché, but I'm living proof that love is blind. Love doesn't see color or race. For me, happiness is the number nine and the taste of milk. It's a big, warm, wet tongue washing all my problems away. Back then, I felt that every day. I don't know how long I was with Mom, but it wasn't long enough. Maybe until my first "woof." She always had this saying, "Humans have no need or desire to understand our language, "but we must be sure to become fluent in theirs. You can't protect yourself from what you can't understand." That's all she could teach me. I bet she never thought the youngest would leave first. Dad? Our relationship lasted all of 12 minutes. And pretty soon after, Dad's human called someone to get rid of me. Here's a little perspective. After waiting behind eight other newborns before entering this world, it becomes pretty clear that you're only entitled to a ninth of the happiness and a ninth of a bone. I started to wonder if Mom had known I was gonna be given away. She couldn't have. She'd have run away with all nine before giving even one of us up Huh? Hmm. I never actually knew who it was that sold me. He passed me off as a bichon frise. Who knows how he pulled that off, considering my dad was a mastiff. The scent of my human immediately pleased me. I filled my nose with the smell of him and warmed my cold bones with his story. A scent is worth a thousand words. It was nighttime. My brothers and sisters were asleep by now. I told myself Mom probably wasn't sleeping. It made me feel better imagining her trying to force open her human's door to come find me- me, the ninth puppy- to lick me, to give me milk. Hey. What's the matter, boy? You missing your mommy? Have you got a family? Oh, you can tell me, boy. No, I'm a girl. Come on, you can tell me, boy. You don't know me and you're scared. It's okay, boy. Let me tell you something. Hey, what do you think you're doing in there, boy? You don't pee in the hat that feeds us. This isn't a bathroom, do you hear me? No pee-pee in the hat. Oh, I-well, I certainly didn't expect that. Goodness gracious, my boy. Y-You're a girl. Oh, boy. You're a girl! My boy is a girl! My boy. Oh. Here's a nice, comfy bed for you, boy. Hmm? My second home. Instinctively, I looked around to see where I might bury my bone. The walls, the hardwood floor, the mattress? Hmm. That could work. The walls again, the door- yeah, no way. The flowerpot? Oh, yeah, I can work with that. Oh. There's no use crying over spilled milk, right? Hey, at least you didn't fall from ten meters up in the air. Words to live by: whenever you fall down, just be glad it wasn't from higher up. So, my boy, what is your name? Nine. My mom's owner probably didn't want to burden us with names we'd soon have to forget. So she gave us nameless names, nine of them. We were One, Two, Three, Four, Five... all the way up to Nine, based on the order we came into the world. There you go. Such a clever girl, aren't you, my boy? So, tell me, what would you like to be called? Nine's good. Let's approach this another way. My name is Manole, the acrobat. The Acrobat Manole. Okay. From now on, when someone asks you what your name is, you tell them, "My name is Ana. I'm with Manole." How's that sound, boy? Nothing had ever belonged to me And now I had so many wonderful things that I was scared I might screw up and lose it all. I had a shelter just for me, a name just for me. And a Manole just for me. I didn't even know if there was enough room inside of me to hold so much happiness. This gift fell from the heavens and saved me. I was only supposed to have a ninth of this. I would have loved to have shared it with Mom, and One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven and Eight. This much joy, it's... it's rare. Ah! Knock it off, boy. You're tickling me. I am training here. This isn't a game. In my field, if you're not the best, you can starve to death. Heck, even the best can starve. Ana, my boy, I am what you would call broke. And now you're broke, too. You kind of married into it. So to speak. But when we're rich, you'll get a hot dog with Swiss cheese every day. So no licking me while I work. Otherwise, I'll break my neck. And that would be less than ideal. Poor? Was he joking? With all of this, I was the richest dog in the world. We danced above the stars, my Manole and I. Huh? Ah. Ha! Hmm? Ah. Mmm-mmm! Ooh... Yeah! Whoa! I have to stay here? Not happening. I don't want to be anywhere my human isn't. How about a bedtime story, boy? This guy? He's Alfredo Codona, a great acrobat- truly, truly great. When he was just seven and a half months old, his father took him on his first flight on the trapeze. Eventually, he flew even higher than his father. He married a girl named Lillian Leitzel, a fellow acrobat. One day, her rope snapped and she fell... ...and landed on a page in every book on acrobats written since. Do you realize what that means, boy? When your life and death become history, it means you never really died and you never will. All right, I'll find us a happier story. You... Look. You see this guy here? His whole family knew how to fly. Acrobats for generations. He strung up a rope just like ours over Niagara Falls. Can you imagine that? And he walked the whole thing. Like a god. Look me in the eyes, Ana, and mark my words. One day, I will drink a beer with that guy. I didn't need my little bed. While he slept, I stood guard. I couldn't help it. I was "as faithful as a dog," as they say. For dogs, happiness is different than it is for humans. We hope things stay exactly as they are... ...while humans always want the next best thing. We're satisfied with a nice belly rub, but humans always want whatever they don't have. They call it "dreaming." I call it "not knowing how to be happy." CIRCUS OF THE MOON Don't you worry, my boy. I-I will never leave you. My Ana and I are a package deal. Got it? I mean, seriously, I have no regrets. I mean, Cirque de la Lune is not so great. I don't care. I really don't. I mean, if-if-if I can't take my own dog, then what is the point, right? Cirque de la Lune - what's so great about the Moon, anyway, huh? I mean, I mean, what's the Moon ever done for me? It doesn't even shine its own light, you know that? Yeah, yeah, and it reflects the light the Sun passes off as its own- what a selfish jerk, the Moon... I learned something that night. Lick your human's face every day as if it were the last time you'd see it. 'Cause one day, it will be. I knew something had shifted in our little home. A new scent hung in the air. A stench, more like. One of despair. My human wasn't my human anymore. I didn't want him to smell so sad. So I left. I didn't want to weigh him down He needed to fly free. I disappeared into an endless night. I slept so I would need nothing In my dreams, sometimes I was with Mom, and One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven and Eight. Sometimes I was with Manole. But when I woke, I was all alone. It hurt less to sleep. Hey. Here, come on. Eat a little something for me. Mmm. Yummy. Ah, you smelled it, huh? Hmm. The scent of mortadella and a human voice cut through the fog. I say "fog" because hunger made it hard to see much. Through it, I made out the shape of Istvan, my new human. Now, of course, I'd like to say it was love at first sight for both of us, but no-it was only after I recovered my strength that I saw he was the most beautiful human I'd ever met. Aside from Manole, of course. Where you off to? I clean up your corner, and now you want to leave? Stay here. Huh. Here. If you get thirsty, okay? I'm coming with you. I won't spend another second here. Huh. If a thief breaks in, you tear 'em to shreds, okay? Come on. Be a good boy. Tomorrow I'll bring you a little treat. Sound good? I'm a girl. Oh, so you're rolling your eyes at me now. Oh. Oh, you're a girl? Yeah. Hold on. What's with the "oh"? How'd a pretty little thing like you end up down here guarding garbage cans? Uh, it's a long story. I'll call you Sara. Sound good? Then I'll see you tomorrow, Sara. Uh, my name's Ana. I'll be back for you soon. Promise. Oh, h-hey. Hey, Sara. Were you a good girl? Did you stand guard? Better eat something. You're so thin, you might blow away. You were scared, huh? Makes sense. Bet you've been on your own awhile. I understand that. I'm scared of being alone, too. All right. I'll be back in the morning. I start work tomorrow, so you'll see me every day. I'm sure you'll even get sick of me after a while. Go get some sleep. Got to get your strength back. Wh-What do you mean sleep? Don't I have to guard the bags? Off to bed, Sara. Good night. My life had meaning again. I had a human, a shelter, even a sidewalk. Food to eat, water to drink, something to protect. My career in showbiz seemed like a long-forgotten memory. Now, I worked in construction. Dogs are pretty open to all trades, as long as belly rubs are involved. Mmm. Yeah. Oh, uh, Sara. You got to back off a bit. Y-You keep getting in the way. Dogs all have this heightened intuition. We can smell trouble. When our human has something weighing on his conscience... and we're about to be abandoned Calm down. Calm down. The human's coming back for you No, he forgot you. Why would he come back? You're just the ninth. Calm down. Calm down. You are working yourself up. He'll return. Night will fall, and when it's day, he'll be back. I think you'll like my mom's place. It'll be fine. Caring for you will do her good. We'll sneak in. I'll wash you, and you can meet her in the morning. Okay? She feels better in the mornings. Less pain. At night, she hates me, too. That's why I can't let her see you now. Come on. We'll see each other on Sundays. Don't be so sad. Good doggy. Shh. Hmm. What does a dog need to be happy? Just having a human to guard while he sleeps. And in the morning, I'd have to take care of someone I had to protect myself from at night. Mom... It's time to wake up, Mom. You need to eat a little and take your pills. Huh? - Did I yell a lot last night? - It wasn't too bad. What'd I say? It's not important. You know the things I say - at night aren't true, right? - Hmm. Hey. I-I'd like you to meet someone special. Are you engaged? Sorry to disappoint. I'm already married. Did you forget? Okay. Promise me you won't get mad, Mom. Sara? Sara. Pretty. Sara. Do we have eggs? Some eggs? O-Of course. Want one hard-boiled? And flour? Well, yeah. - And milk? - Well, I-I mean, we do, but why? Where are my slippers? Come. I'll make crepes. Mmm. Humans are strange creatures. It doesn't take much to make them happy. And sometimes they realize that Mmm. Mm-hmm. Watch over Mom till I get back. Okay? Oh! I'm so sorry. Don't be scared. I had to watch over her. I promised him. But that was easier said than done. I shouldn't have let my guard down on the job. Everything hurt. I couldn't move. But I wouldn't sleep. I had to be awake when Istvan returned. First, I heard the doorbell. Then the door opened. His silhouette. I heard the old woman say, "Accident." I know you didn't do it on purpose, Mom. Would you care to lie down, ma'am? Let's begin. Here's something to ease her pain. If you wish, we can hospitalize her. Could you take a look at the dog, too? No. We don't tend to animals here. We could take her home with us. What do you think? I've told you, your mother needs to be put into a home. But the dog's coming with us. You sure? What do you mean, am I sure? I adore animals. You? You can't stand animals. Even birds drive you crazy. Then clearly, you don't know me at all, Istvan. Not at all. It's my dream to create a shelter for poor, helpless animals. Well, two days ago, it was victims of domestic violence. Now it's animals? Are you sure you want to keep the dog? I've never been more sure about anything. I'll take her to the vet. You accompany your mother. Oh, wait, no. You carry her to the car. She's bloody, and this is dry-clean only. She's lost a lot of blood, and her paw's been injured, quite seriously. I-I can't promise anything. It all depends on her, if she- well, uh, experience has taught me not to give false hope prematurely. - What breed is she? - I'm sorry, what? Well, she looks like a purebred dog, so what's her breed? Uh, I would say part mastiff and God only knows what else. I wanted a rescue dog. One of those abandoned mutts. You said you found her in the streets, did you not? That sounds pretty abandoned to me. Look, she's in critical condition, but the treatment is not free. If you wanted a charity case, then you found one. If not, then we'll just have to put her down. How much will it cost? And how long will you keep her here? Hmm. The three of us will be a family. And we'll call you Sara. How original. My name is Sara. Sara. Come on, Sara. What's wrong with her? Is she deaf? I smelled trouble from the start. I said, "Sara, come here." All right. I'm coming. My nose told me, "She's not your human, and she doesn't like dogs." I'll have her trained in no time. I have a gift for animal communication. Don't be scared. She'll get bored and stop bothering you soon. Just give it a few days. Istvan. Istvan. Istvan. I could fall for every letter. Shut up. Really? Oh, well, listen to this. It's so cool. I just rescued... a dog. When are you coming to see her? Oh, I don't know, she's brownish. She's super cute. There's a sale at Mango's? Really? What if I got a brown leather jacket and walked Sara with it, and we matched? Wouldn't you just die? Meet my darling Sara. An absolute dream of a dog. I swear, she's basically human. - But she can't talk. - Where'd you get her from? - Were there any others? - Please don't tell me you're gonna copy her and get a dog, too. Why do you have to copy everything Mada does? You are so not original. Whatever. It's not like Mada invented dogs. If she wants a dog, let her. - We're saving the world. - Yes. Did there happen to be, I don't know, any other brownish dogs there? Nope. She's one of a kind. I loved the times it was just my human and me... and that woman was gone. I liked taking him to the park at night, since he worked so hard all day We took a ball because I knew he loved throwing it for some reason. He wasn't much for fetching, so I did it for him. I'd run it back to him so he wouldn't be without it for too long. It was all about the three "quicks." "Quick, find it. Quick, grab it Quick, bring it back." But the effort was worth it when I saw the joy on his face as he threw the ball. Oh... oh! Mmm. Mm-hmm. Ooh! Oh. The house reeks of dog. Mm! Ugh! We have to figure out this Sara thing. I mean, look. What? I'm all hairy. - So wax. - No. On my clothing. Her little dog hairs are everywhere. We can't go on living like this. Plus, I think I'm allergic. And when you insisted on taking in Sara, - were you not allergic then? - I wanted to do the right thing. You know I'm a good person. I'm sorry, is my health not as important to you as some dog? - If you're intending to kick Sara out of the house... ...just know, I'm going, too. She's not some handbag you toss out when you're sick of it. Oh, I'm not sick of her. She's my Sara. But my lungs are filling up with her hair. I know what you're doing. Sara stays till the day she dies. She's a part of the family. Got it? Bianca got herself a cute little Yorkie. She takes it with her everywhere. It fits into her purse. Then I'll buy you a bigger purse. Huh. Hmm. Mm. Ugh! Huh? What are you doing in here? Hmm. Why was Sara in the closet? Sweetie, I can't risk getting sick because of her germs. I'm not saying to give her up. There's a perfectly suitable place for her under the back stairs, and she'll love it there. She's always in her doggy bed anyway. First, she locked me in a closet. Then it was under the stairs. After that, I was banished to the courtyard. He said he was scared to be alone. I couldn't leave him alone with her. Look. - Istvan? Istvan? - Hmm? What are you doing? Will you be long? You need something? I'm not feeling well, and I don't like being all by myself. Mm. Sara, you know I love you. I know. I love you, too. All right. One last throw for old time's sake. Okay? Hmm. This is the last time. I know. After a while, you begin to smell the last times coming. It smelled like rust... and rotten leaves. I just hoped Istvan was better than me at goodbyes. Who'd bring the ball back for him? That's all I could think: that he'd throw it and there'd be nobody there to fetch it. Fear settled in, and I sensed that this night was it. That night, the bad men came, with nets and poles, and their scent- the scent I knew I had to be afraid of. Fear. Calm down. Calm down. "Stay calm," I told myself. Think. I've got twice as many legs as the bad man. Plenty of legs and no desire to die. Hang on, this part gets dicey. I added Istvan to my box of joys, a place where all my favorite lost things could stay forever. It was getting quite crowded. Hi, teensy doggy. Is something wrong, or are you just taking a little nap? Oh. Hi, little human. Who are you? My name's Solange. Don't be scared, okay? Did I wake you up? Yeah, you kind of did. Is something wrong? I thought you were sick or something, but you're not sick at all. Are you, little fella? Are you? No, but I am a girl. Oh, so you're a girl doggy. - What's your name? - Sara. Oh... I should probably give you a name- and it's got to be good- but I don't want to give you a name that isn't your name. Oh, I'm used to it by now. It's got to be one no one else in the world has. - Hmm. - Hmm. What a great little human. - I like her. - Do you have a home? Not really. You? Me, neither. Well, I guess I-I mean, I live in a house, but I'm just a kid who lives there. And when you're a kid living with grown-ups, you got to follow the rules, and there's so many. Rules, rules, rules. You can't just do whatever you want. You have to go to bed and get up when the grown-ups tell you to. And it's no fun at all, but I'll make space for you in my part of the house. Okay? Come on, doggy. Considering I had no other plans and I was starving, who was I to turn down the invitation? Shh. This cat had it out for me from the very start. Psst. Hey. Hey, you know you've got a cat up there? Right there, on the bookshelf. A cat. Oh, that's just Martzofel. He's our cat. He's a sweetie. You'll see. Martzofel? You named it? You've got a cat in your home, and you even gave it a name? Stay here and be good. I'll get you something yummy to eat, 'kay? Is this a joke? Yeah, I'm not gonna eat that. But monkeys eat bananas. Do I look like a monkey? I'm a dog. Get it? A dog. I'll go get you something else, okay? Probably a good idea. But first, you can't make a sound. I have to introduce you to my family. One by one. But first, we got to find you a good hiding spot. Hmm. Oh, I found one. Hey, do you think you can stay in here? Just till I can explain all this to my family. Hey, if you don't mind, I'm gonna get some rest. I did a lot of running last night. I'll leave the top like this so you can breathe easier. Mm. Mm. Call me crazy, but I think her plan to introduce me slowly didn't go as planned. Mommy, didn't you say we should always help those less fortunate? Oh, she's good. You'd better watch out for this one. I also said you should never lie or act without consulting us. What do you mean, "consult us"? She's just an entitled little turd. And you're her mom. Turds don't consult their moms. Dad, please. Solange, you can't just do whatever you want in this house without asking. You know better than that. No, but, Mommy, if you kick my doggy out, I'll die of sadness. Don't let her fool you. You know you were just as devious at her age. Dad, I've got this handled. No, Solange, let this be a lesson to you. This wouldn't have happened if you'd been honest with me. Now send him back where you found him. Hm. Do whatever you want. What I say doesn't matter anyway. Aw... I guess I should've shown a little more gratitude. After all, she did fight for me But life had taught me happiness was short-lived and pain was always around the corner. I already felt so old. Admit it, Mommy. Isn't our dog the prettiest ever? Well, honey, I guess. Looks like we've got one more girl in the house now. Great, just what I needed. My doggy princess on her throne. I think I'll call her Marona. Nine, Ana, Sara, Marona. Throwing out a dog's name is even easier than tossing 'em a bone. I just wanted to curl up in that hamper, close the lid and hide. If ever there was a perfect moment, this would be one of them. Moments like these make a dog's life worth living. There was something really sketchy about that animal. I couldn't say exactly what, but-hmm- something was just off. That dumb cliché about the war between mice and cats, or cats and dogs-sorry, but cats don't hate mice. They eat them. That's all. It's less to do with feelings and more to do with stomachs. But dogs don't eat cats. Their stomachs don't want them. So I am not off-base in saying that Martzofel... had some serious issues. Hurry up, Solange. Finish your homework. - Mm. - Your mom will be home soon for dinner. - Solange. - Mm? Soup's ready. Finish your homework, or your mother's not gonna be happy. Very well. In that case, you better get this dog out of my house! In spite of the sense of foreboding I couldn't shake, I stayed in that house, filled to the brim with clutter an insane cat, with an old man who hated me at first sight, an exhausted and lonely single mother, and a little girl who got bored so quickly. Marona, come on. I know you're not in a rush, but I've got to make breakfast and go to work. Come on, honey. Do your thing and let's go. She was stretched so thin. The last thing she needed was a dog. She ran that house single-handedly. Whenever it almost slipped from her grasp, she always got things back on track. Hmm. Mm. Hmm. Mm? Mm. Hmm. Mm. Hmm. Huh? Hey, Mom, I'm going out with Vero and Cipri. Take Marona with you. You haven't walked her today. I'll do it when I get back. You'll take her out now, Solange. I'll be back in an hour. I'll take her out then. No, I said you'll take her out now! Do it now, or you're grounded. Fine. Let's go, Marona. How would you sum up a dog's life? We can start by, "You always have to hold it in when nature calls." I'd love to see how she would feel if she had to depend on the goodwill of someone else whenever she had to pee. Luckily, that leash was too short for me to reach him. If I had, he'd have seen me. And I know there was no room in that car for me. Not with all the dreams inside. His familiar scent made me forget my name a second. If I had been human, I could have cried. I inhaled one last time, and for the length of that breath, he was with me again. Solange, are you studying for tomorrow's exam? - Yes. - Solange, I'm not going to tell you twice. Turn that stupid computer off right now. Come on, get off my back. Solange, if you don't start studying, I'll throw your damn dog in the street. Okay. Do it. What are you waiting for? Let's go, Miruna! - Her name is Marona. - Who gives a crap what her name is? It's time for you to say goodbye to the damn mutt. Blackmail makes you morally bankrupt. You know who else does that? Totalitarian dictators. What's Medeea gonna do with that kid? I'm not long for this world. She can't do it on her own. You're part of it, too. Animals should be outside. Humans inside. But we pervert it. People in the street and animals in the houses. We can barely feed ourselves. But we still have to take in all the neighborhood strays. Wait, how exactly do you define "stray"? Well, it's our problem, not yours. Besides, you're not all that bad for a mutt. You don't beg, chew furniture, piss all over the house. But you're still a mouth to feed. You know, I could just leave you here and go home without you. Why do kids grow into such jerks? God only knows how Medeea handles their debt. And the girl's father trying to steal her kid. Real piece of work, he is. Oh, yeah, sure, now that she's older and prettier, he wants her. But when she was in diapers, he couldn't run fast enough. I pity my daughter, Miruna. Understand? Marina, Maroo-ah, who cares? Poor thing's been working like a dog since she was 18, Miruna. Call me whatever, but in case you're curious, it's Nine. Whatever's fine. You've got a lot on your mind. Oh. Huh? Hey, Dad. I'll be back in an hour with chicken soup and your books. Okay? Don't rush back on my account. And take this one home first. It's a lot for her. You can bring those tomorrow. I need my rest. Please, go on now. Bye, Grandpa. Thank you, Miruna. Don't thank me. Just doing my duty. - Hmm. - Good night. Walk Miruna, will you? Grandpa, it's Marona. How are you still getting it wrong? - It's been years. - Marina, Malina, Mandalina. What's the difference? You walking her or not? Yeah, I was just about to. Hmm. How're you doing, Marona? Going for a little stroll? I'm glad you're taking her out. You little cutie. Okay. Have fun rolling around in the grass. Oh, I can't take you with me, but I'll be back in an hour. Don't be scared. Marona? Marona! If no one minds too much, I'd like to take a moment to rewind the film of my life. I heard that's what you do when you die. Rewatch the story of your life.
