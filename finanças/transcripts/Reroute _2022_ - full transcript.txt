--== McEphie ==-- For latest releases visit moviesnipipay website So what are you saying? That it's part of the job? Here we go again. I knew it. I should've just stayed home. I know how this goes, Dan. It's gonna be another argument. Isn't that what you always want? You'd rather stay behind and be free of me. So you can do all the bullshit that you do while I'm away. In case you forgot, I have work, Dan. So? But I took some time off so I could be with you and your damn friends. And this is the thanks I get? Now you think I'm a slacker? We've been over this, haven't we? I'm sorry, alright? This is all temporary, I'm bound to get some work soon. Seriously? Temporary... Your shitty band's no good for anything anyway. What? What did you say? What did you say? I said I'm not giving you a lecture, I'm just trying to make you understand. Oh, right, sure, sorry! Sorry I'm an idiot. I'm slow on the uptake. That's what you meant. Shit. I don't know what you want from me, Dan. What is it that you want, Dan? Well? I want us to have a proper conversation. Tell me the truth. A conversation? Then talk to me like you mean it! Just admit it! Admit? Admit what? Woman, I'm trying to level with you but you want to play dumb! Fine! Fine! You have nothing to admit! What, is this about that text a while ago? Didn't you read it yourself?! Did you find anything?! Something wrong with it? I don't know what you want from me! It's always like this! You're making shit up! You're all the same. People like you. Accountants of whatever. Some bank's account manager-- You'll do anything just to get a large account. Including whoring yourself off to your clients. - Where is that damn lighter? - What did you say to me? I said you're all the same, son of a bitch! - I'm driving, you bitch! - You asshole! You're going to get us killed, dipshit! You asshole! Let's just go home! This is pointless! Jesus Christ. I'm too ambitious. Where's the goddamn lighter?! Shit! Ouch! Are you staying here? Shit! Hi ma'am! One bulalo, two cups of rice, and a bottle of soda. Anything else? What do you want? Anything. Just that for now. Okay. - Thanks. - Thank you. Yeah? Yeah, we're almost there, about four hours away. But we'll see, it's raining a bit. We'll see. Watch it! I'm sorry, sir! Sorry! Yeah, sorry you're a dumbass! Hey, man! I said sorry, didn't I? Some half-assed apology that was! - These tourists, man! - Come on, come on. Walking around like you own the place! I was apologizing, wasn't I?! - What do you want? - Dan! Dan! You cocky son of a bitch! Dan! Dan stop it! You son of a bitch! That all you got?! Dan! Let's go, just leave it, Dan! - Not so tough now, are you?! - Stop it! Cut it out, Dan! I told you to stop it! Screw you, asshole! Serves you right! Shut up, Dan!! We're leaving! Screw you! I said sorry! - Asshole! - Stop it! Alright! Dan. What the hell's your problem? You almost beat that man to death! Are you even thinking? His fault for acting like a dipshit! I apologized, didn’t I?! You heard me! I know! But he apologized to you, too, didn’t he?! What the hell do you want me to do? Dan, please! Watch your temper! What, you want me to roll over and take that shit? Screw him! No way! He should be glad I didn't smash his head in! Stop, pull over. Stop car! Jesus Christ, Dan. How many times has this happened? I'm sorry. I couldn't help myself. I'm sorry. Think about me for a second. Can't you try to be more patient? I'm sorry… I love you. You're just shameless, is what you are. Well? Ouch! Let's do it. Looks like there's no one around! - You're crazy. - I'm crazy? I told you I was just kidding, you're the one who took it seriously! All it took was 'I love you'! - So, you didn't want it? - I didn't say that! We already did it. - Wipe yourself down! - Hey, it'll get wet! - Hello, bro? - Hello? Yeah, we're going to drop by to see dad. He'll be happy to see you guys. Yeah, but we won't stay long. That's too bad! We have a gig to get to. - How is he? - He's doing good. He can walk now?! Well, that's good! I'll call later, alright? Okay, okay. Bye. Take care, bro. Turn back. Turn your vehicle around! You can't pass through here. Go back around, please. You can't pass through here. Alright, alright. Go back around, please. You can't pass through here. Sir, what's going on? Sir, you can't pass through here. We've got an operation going on. Sir, maybe you could let us through. We just need to get to the next barangay. There's a reroute you could take, sir. That's where we ask everyone to go. Where would that be? It's through the new highway, you're going to have to go back to town. Sir, that's way too far. If we go back, we'll be delayed till tomorrow! We really can't let you through, sir, I'm really sorry. But you're going to have to turn back. We're really sorry, sir. Sir, I don't think you're hearing me. If we pass through here, we'll be there in five minutes! We really can't let you. We're sorry, sir. You're going to have to go around. Alright, thank you, sir. Unbelievable. - This way, sir. - Thanks. Thanks! Move forward! You can't pass through here, sorry! Are you sure this is the right way? Of course. We used to take this road when we were kids. Me and my friends, driving around on our motorcycles. I think this is it. Hang on. This is it. Roll it down, I can't see. Dan. You sure about where we're going? Yeah! Why? This place looks deserted. I can't even get a signal. If we can find another way, we'll take it. Let me ask for directions, just to be sure. You really grew up here? I told you! Look, we'll ask someone if you're not convinced, okay? There's someone up ahead. Sir! Can we ask for directions? Sure, no problem. Sir, this is the road going to Morinda, right? - Morinda? - Yes. Well, yes, it is, but you've still got some ways to go. Yes but-- we're along Sampaloc, right? Yes, sir, you're right. This is Sampaloc, but... if I were you, you'd best just turn around now. You're on private property. We'll take it from here! Nah, it's fine. Don't worry about it. I don't like the sound of that. There we go! Thank you! Dan, let's turn back. That's what the man said, too. We should turn back right now. Yeah, but this way is faster. If we turn back now it'll take twice as long to get there! Dan he said this was private property, remember? Yeah, but it's night time. What if someone arrests us for tresspassing? No one's going to arrest us! At this time of the night? Dan! What? You're putting us in danger. I know this place! Seriously, it's fine. We're just going to pass through, and then we're done! That's it! Dan, what's happening? I don't know! What happened? How should I know? Goddamn it. Shit! Here we go, goddamn it! Goddamn it! Is it the battery? I don't know but if it's the battery it won't be smoking like that. Well? I don't even know what I'm looking at! - Hand it over. - Check the fusebox! Hand over the, the… - The what? - Hand over the flashlight. I don't know what the problem is. I don't even know what I'm trying to look for, Damn it. Check the fusebox! No, no. I think it's coming from the other side. I can't smell anything. What do we do? - Dunno. - Should you push? Push this? Uphill? Are you serious right now? Then how the hell are we supposed to get out of here! Wait. I'm trying to find a way, alright? Give me a minute. Dan, there's no cell service! Just try it. - Try what, there's nothing! - Hand me the cigarettes. Dan, there's no service! I know, damn it! but let me try! What else are we going to do?! Why didn't you check this earlier? You never think about these things. Check what? What was there to check, tell me? I don't even know what I'm supposed to look for in there! Goddamn it, guess we're stuck here. Screw you, too! Tins, I'm going to go look for help. Can't get this pile of junk to work. Anybody home? Anybody home? Do you need help? - Yes, sir. - Are you alone? I have someone with me. Tina! I still couldn't get any service, we're in the Sahara! What? Sir! Could you help us push the car? Could you help us push the car, sir? Huh? Where? Until where? Just until the exit. But if you know a mechanic nearby that'd be helpful. It's too far. It's going to be difficult. I was about to go home. If you want, we can push it towards my house. Then I can radio for a mechanic. Sure, sounds like a plan. My house isn't that far from here. - Sure, let's get moving. - Okay! You stay inside. Can I load this at the back? Yeah, sure. Push! Push! The door! Tina, the keys! Come on! Lala! Come in. Lala! Well? Come in. My wife. La, can you fix something? Thank you. I'm good, thanks. You're from Manila? Yes, sir. Where were you headed? We were on our way to Morinda. But we didn't know there was a roadblock, and the reroute was too far. So we didn't go through there. We decided to take the shortcut. I know the way, but the car broke down. No one passes through here anymore. This is private property. That so? Back when I was younger, my friends and I would drive through here. We would ride through here on our motorcycles. You're from Morinda? Yes, I grew up there. I have family there. My mother, she's gone… but my dad… he's still alive. We're going to visit him. What's your father's last name? Perilla, sir. Perilla. Perilla. Are you familiar with that name? What's your name? Rodante, sir. They call me Dan. Alpha one to zero zero, Alpha one to zero zero, over? - I'm good, you should drink yours. - I have a message from Omega. - Don't you have any cell service yet? - I repeat: a message from Omega. 10-25 a.s.a.p. at the usual meet-up point. You have an urgent mission. Please acknowledge. Zero Zero. Zero Zero to Alpha One, come in. Over. Urgent message from Omega. Confirm if you'll join the operation. Please acknowledge. Zero Zero to Alpha One, come in. Over. I repeat: Omega requests confirmation if you will take on the job. Sir? What is it? I wonder if you could ask for a mechanic on the radio. Sure. Wait. Buddy. Could you send over a mechanic here? Someone's car broke down, I just want to help. To your area? That's tresspassing, man. I know. They seem like good folk, just got lost. If possible, send them tonight. We might get in trouble for that. Sir, maybe you could say it's an emergency? They say it's an emergency. Fat chance tonight. I'll call you tomorrow morning if I can find one. They said they'll call us tomorrow if they find someone. Is no one available tonight? They said they'll call us tomorrow if they find someone. Zeta Zero. Zeta Zero to Alpha One, over. I hate this shit. I give up. I wanna go to sleep. You're not the only one. You couldn't just stick to the right road. That would take us farther away, remember? That's why we took this road. And then that checkpoint. We didn't need to go here in the first place. I don't know what we're going to do. Why are you blaming me? How should I know that the car would break down? You don't know because you didn't check. Fine, I'm sorry. - Yeah, that's what I thought. - I didn't know this would happen. - We'll miss everything when we get there. - This is your fault. I got someone. Said they'll be here tomorrow. Thank you, sir. Would you like a drink? Nah, sir. I'm beat. Think I'll just get some shut-eye. I don't drink, but thank you for the offer. You can sleep in my house if you want. No, thank you, sir. We're used to sleeping in the car. We'll be fine. Yes, sir, it's no problem at all. We'll just sleep there. Are you sure? Yes, we've given you too much trouble as it is. Something for it. If there's a problem, just call me. Okay sir, thank you. What was that? You were seriously giving him 200 PHP? Why not? That's embarrassing! Why? That's everything I had in my wallet! At least I gave something! You idiot! Just think of something to get us out of here! I already am. Hurry up, - open the car! - Hang on! It's muddy! That was creepy. That Lala lady's creepy. You noticed? The way she was looking at us! They're both weird! You can't talk to them properly. Especially the guy! Hand me the towel. They're both weird! Let's just sleep. You go first. Shit! - What? What?! - There's someone there! Shit! Shit! - Shit! - Are you sure?! There's no one there! You okay? Breakfast is ready if you want to eat. Is sir awake? Yes. Was he able to talk to… the guy from last night? He's out at the back. Ask him yourself. Friends and listeners, this missing person case is creating a big buzz because it's a foreigner working within that area, there've been many reports of missing persons that end up getting brushed over, right? A few short mentions here and there but never reaching national news. If you think about it, people became active online only recently. The number of cases cranked up around the time local operations began. We can no longer if we're dealing with killers for hire, authorities, riding-in-tandem, or it's the work of individual killers. Sometimes, even local officials are probable suspects. The cost of one human's life is nothing to you if you want someone dead-- Did you eat yet? Just came to ask if there's an update. This is one of the animals I keep around here, but it escaped. I hunted it down and found it over yonder. It got too far so I killed it. Probably realized I was going to butcher it, so it tried to escape. He won't call until later. You should eat first. Or do you want to wait for this instead? I think I'll just wait inside, sir. Thanks. …among the trees, with their guns, they'll set up barracks. You can't make them leave. Imagine if you happen to pass through there. No matter how hard you try to lose them, you might be dealing with a killer! You should eat. I lost my appetite. This will do. I'll go check the car. Thank you. What is sir's name, by the way? Gemo. He used to be a soldier. He had a wife and child, but they both died. They were from Morinda, too. His kid, Ariana, got pregnant. The guy left her. Ariana's mom brought her to a witch doctor to have the baby aborted. A couple of days later, Ariana died. She had a flu. She was so young when she died. She was just 16. His wife hung herself after. I guess she blamed herself. Ariana was his daughter's name? Yes. She was so beautiful. There's a photo of her there. He loved her so much. He told me he's always wanted revenge… That he'll kill whoever got his child pregnant. But he doesn't know where he's gone. Screw this. Piece of shit! How's it going? I don't even know where this is attached to! Dan. Does this look like-- Is that a cut cable or what? What the... Dan. Screw all of this. What?! I heard what happened to Gemo's daughter was pretty tragic. Yeah? So? Someone from Morinda knocked up Gemo's daughter. Well, that's just how things happen. The girl must have been asking for it. No. What's worse is that his daughter killed herself. Since then Gemo's been looking for the guy who screwed her over. Men really are shit. Dan! Leave that for now. It's time to eat! Then we'll go and fetch the mechanic. You should eat. You haven't eaten anything yet. Oh, yeah, I'm eating. Dig in while it's warm! Thank you, sir. Let us pray. We give praise and thanks for the life You have given us We thank You for the food on our table, May it nourish and strengthen us every day. We hope and pray that You guide us and deliver us from evil. All these are offerings, praises, thanks, and prayers we make in Your name, and in the name of Jesus Christ, who lives on forever and ever Amen. Amen. Want some rice? No, you go ahead. You don't have a child yet? No, sir. We don't. That means your seminal fluids do not match. You should eat, Dan. You'll need your strength later. What about you, sir? Don't you have any kids? I heard you were a soldier. ARMY. And that you were assigned in Mindanao? What else did she tell you about me? That's it. Just about you being a soldier. Pull it together! What do you want me to do? Let's just get out of here! Yeah! We've been trying since yesterday! I'm just going to eat. Then let's find a way. Getting cell reception yet? What's taking him so goddamned long?! Our friends are still waiting for us! Well, let's go. Let's go. You should stay behind, Trina. It's a long way from here, where we're going. Let's go. Wait for us. Hurry. If I were you, I'd leave now. It's down here. Over here. Have you lived here long? Yes. Who owns the land? A general owns it, I'm just watching over the land. That's lucky. Not really. Why can't you get your wife pregnant, Dan? Are you infertile? You're not infertile are you? Maybe you don't make love with her. Why are we talking about this? Maybe you make love with someone else. Shit. Your wife is beautiful, Dan. Would you like me to help you? - Well? - Huh? Would you like me to help get your wife pregnant? Do you know why my child died? Sir, I have no idea what you're talking about. My daughter was beautiful, Dan. I took such good care of her. She was absolutely beautiful and I did not touch her because my faith in God was strong but you tainted her, you bastard! You asshole! Holy shit! - You son of a bitch! - Screw you! Dan? Shit! You son of a bitch! Asshole! Bastard! Screw you! You asshole! Animals! That's what you are! Monsters! You violated my child! You disgraced her! So let me return the favor! Hey! See how it feels like! You pig! Asshole! If you're a monster I am a demon! I'm not like you. You animal! Filthy pig! Filthy pig! Filthy, disgusting swine! You filthy animals! Animals! You animal! You animal! You're disgusting! You animal! Animal! Animal! Animal! Animal! Animal! Animal! Sir? Where's Dan? Sir! Sir? Dan?! Dan! Dan! Dan! Help me! Help! What happened to you? Calm down. Tell me what happened. He killed… Gemo killed my husband! What? Gemo? Alicia! Alicia, come here! - Alicia, look after her. - Help me! - I'm going to the barangay! - Help me! My husband… Please don't give me to him! Come on, come on. Don't! Come on, come on. My husband! Please, have mercy! Don't give me to him! Stop fighting, come on. - My husband! - Come on, come on. My husband! Stop. Stop struggling. This is for your own good. Stand up. This is for your own good. Please, have mercy! - This is for your own good, child. - Please have mercy! Please have mercy! - Come on, come on. - I don't want to! This is to keep you safe. - I don't want to! - This is to keep you safe, come on. This is for you. Calm down, stay there. Sir! Get in! Get in! - Sir! - Get in! Get in! Sir! Sir! Quiet down. Please, please have mercy! - Please quiet down. - Sir! Keep it down. Quiet! Quiet down! Quiet! Quiet down! My husband! Please, have mercy! Please, have mercy! Get back in! Get back inside! Get back in! Get me out of here! You stubborn bitch! You stubborn bitch! Get me out of here! You want to starve to death. Go and die from hunger! Get me out of here! Shut up! Shut up! You don't want to listen to me! Stay there and starve! Don't feed her! Go and die from hunger! Get me out of here! Get me out of here! Dan! My husband! Do you know why I killed your boyfriend? Because he got my daughter pregnant. She was so young… so beautiful… He got her pregnant, and then left her after toying with her. That's the kind of asshole your boyfriend was. A criminal! A wolf in sheep's clothing. I was far from home back then. It only happened because I wasn't here. I looked everywhere for him, but I couldn't find him. Now, the spirit of my daughter brought him here. But his life isn't enough for what he did to my child. It's not enough. Perhaps the reason why you're here is so you can fill the gap. I'll take her. Here, child. Come on. Let's dry your hair, child. Come on, we need to dry your hair. There. There we go. There. There. Stay there, alright? Just stay put. Here, my darling. I kept this for your birthday! Look how pretty it is! It is very pretty. This was for your birthday! There. Go, put it on, my child, put it on! There we go. There we go. There we go. There. There. There you are. See, it fits perfectly! This is supposed to fit. This should fit you. This will fit you, darling. It will. There, what did I tell you. I've missed you so much, my daughter. I've missed you so much, my daughter. I've missed you so much, my daughter. So, so much. I've missed you so much. Have a seat. Lala. Hurry up with the food. Sit down. Lala, where's the food? Let us pray. We give thanks and praise for the food on our table this evening. May it nourish our bodies every day. We ask this through Christ, our lord, who lives and reigns forever and ever, Amen. Bring the rice closer. Lala, why is the… Put this… Eat up, my dear. Put the rice here. Dear, go on and eat. Let's eat, my child, come on. Where's the water? Prepare everything, Lala! Do I have to tell you one by one? It should already be on the table. Here it is. Do it properly. Get a rag for this. Get a rag! Do it over. Lala, you better behave yourself. Behave yourself, Lala! Replace this! Lala, hurry up. The food is waiting. You're embarrassing us in front of my daughter. Be careful. Good, go back to your seat. Alright, my darling, let's eat! Here's some rice. Come and sit down, Lala! Eat up, my dear. Come on, my child. Eat up! Eat up, this is good! Eat. Eat, Lala. Eat. Let's eat, my child. It's really good, dear, This is your favorite part, isn't it?

Come on, my child, let's eat. Look, it's your favorite! I cooked your favorite just for you. Go on, my child. Go on, come on. Yes, that's good. There. There we go! There. Very good, my child, very good. What a good and obedient daughter you are, listening to father! Such a good girl! Very good! Very good! Take another bite. Go on, eat some more. Have some more! Have another bite, my child. Go on, dear, just eat. Sit down. We'll pray, my child, just sit down. Almighty God who created all, Grace us with Your presence this evening. Send your angels to watch over us. Ten of Archangel Gabriel's soldiers, to protect us from demons and those who would harm us. Strengthen my heart and mind so that I may defeat whomsoever that would lead this household into darkness. You, Almighty God, are my power and strength. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, amen. Shhh, my dear. You'll sleep here, okay? You'll be here, and we'll lie together, alright, my child? But don't worry. I'll take care of you. You won't get hurt, I promise you. You'll feel no pain. I'll take care of you. Just be good to father, okay? Just be good. Be good to father, my child. Calm down. Calm down, calm down. Just calm down. Shh, you're not going to get hurt, you're not going to get hurt, my dear. It's quiet here, my child. In Manila there's nothing but noise and pollution. Here, you'll hear nothing but the sound of flowing waters the whistling wind and the chorus of crickets! - Noy! - Yes? - Coffee. - Yes, sir. Let's sit here. It's so beautiful here, see? I planted all that! That's ginger. There's so many! It took me so long to plant all that, dear. These vegetables here are taro, squash, sweet potatoes… We can pick and cook them fresh from the field. Wait, my child. Wait here. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Catch her! Hold her! Hold her! Come on! Come on! Let go of me! Come on! Hold her! Let go of me! Hold her! Don't let go! My child. Stop trying to leave, just stay here with father. You'll get yourself in trouble again. Come closer. Fix your hair. This is what you've always wanted, my dear, am I right? You used to tell me that you wanted to be a writer. Here, you can write in peace, free of demons preying on you. And they wouldn't dare come near you, because I've buried demons in this land. Dan knows this all too well. You will be safe here, my child. No one will bother us here anymore. And should anyone trespass, I will make sure they won't be coming back because they will never get out of this place. It is all for you. So, my dear, that is why you must always obey Father, okay? Okay? You remember this, dear? Do you remember this? This was when you went out to go to your aunt's house. This was you with your cousins. We were so happy then! You were so beautiful even when you were younger, weren’t you? You remember? This, this was when your other cousin was born, Your uncle took a picture of him with you. This was you with all of your cousins. We were so happy there! We went swimming in the river. We were so happy then, my child, weren't we? This was you with your classmates-- here's your best friend, you remember? We were so happy then! That's why I'm happy you're here now. Where's the-- Where's the-- Where's the picture when you were 16? On your birthday? La! La! Where's the picture where she was 16? Why isn't it here? Did you touch this again? No one else would touch this! You messed with it again! You're the only one who could've taken it! I can't find other pictures of her, you know that. Here, this was from your first communion. Do you remember? Your mother and I loved you so much. Here--your mother was so beautiful. You're as beautiful as your mother. Like two peas in a pod. There. We were so happy then, my child! So very happy.
